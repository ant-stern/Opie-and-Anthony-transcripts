<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony recounting a harrowing two-day hiking trip gone wrong. He and his girlfriend got lost in the woods, facing rain, difficult terrain, and a black bear encounter.  Their lack of preparedness,  a shared thin jacket, and Anthony's ankle injury added to the ordeal, ultimately resulting in a rescue. This experience led him to purchase a satellite phone, which sparked a discussion about apocalypse preparedness.  Studio guest Jim Florentine showcased his extensive survival kit (“go-bag”), leading to a call-in segment where listeners shared their own preparedness strategies, ranging from elaborate escape plans to intense physical training.  The conversation featured humorous debate about escaping New York City, specifically using boats and less-traveled waterways.  Anthony concluded this segment by mentioning his exorbitant water bill due to a pool leak.

Next, actor Jason Statham joined the show, initially causing confusion regarding planned stunts.  The conversation shifted to his stunt work, career beginnings selling perfume and jewelry, and his attendance at Guy Ritchie and Madonna's wedding.  Callers praised his films (Transporter, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Snatch).  There was confusion over details about his new film, *Crank*, fueled by inaccurate information from a show staffer named Roland. Rumors about relationships with Charlize Theron and Mark Wahlberg were also discussed.  A call from Edward Norton ensued, with pleasantries exchanged and Norton offering advice on appearing on David Letterman. The conversation touched upon acting techniques and personal transportation methods (Statham’s pilot’s license, Norton’s subway use).  The segment concluded with listener calls and crude humor about weight gain in spouses and marital issues, featuring several callers sharing personal experiences.

The following segment began with a caller, Sharon, suggesting a contest where an overweight wife has a month to lose 50 pounds or her husband sleeps with a stripper.  This led to a discussion on the merits and drawbacks of the idea.  Another caller, Steve, described his wife's significant weight gain over 21 years of marriage, likening her food-watching habits to pornography. He admitted to still finding her somewhat attractive. Subsequent calls echoed similar opinions about overweight women, with the hosts interjecting jokes. The segment transitioned into playing audio clips from Russ Meyer's "Mondo Topless," focusing on Meyer's narration and the often inarticulate dancers.

This was followed by a graphic and detailed description of one of the hosts (Jimmy) using the restroom, including audio of the sounds produced, causing laughter and disgust amongst the other hosts and one host (Bob) vomiting.

Another segment detailed a host's bathroom struggles, including a desperate search for toilet paper and a severe case of diarrhea, graphically described with accompanying sounds of distress and vomiting, culminating in the soiling of a microphone.  Following this, “Tippy Tom” joined the show. His rambling, nonsensical conversation covered nuclear weapons, oil prices, anal sex, cloning, the Da Vinci Code, his mother's alleged mob connections, and included snippets of various songs. Listener calls led to further tangents. The segment ended with promotion for Tippy Tom's appearance at Caroline's Comedy Club.

The final segment discussed video games, comparing the realism of modern games to older arcade titles.  The hosts recounted frightening experiences playing games like *King Kong*, lamented the lack of cheat codes in modern games, and discussed the disturbing realism in modern titles. Callers shared their experiences with frightening games like *Fear* and *Resident Evil Outbreak*.  The conversation abruptly shifted to a discussion of dominatrixes, spurred by a mention of Karen Von Croft's website.  The hosts and callers shared anecdotes and opinions about BDSM, ranging from playful banter to descriptions of extreme and dangerous scenarios, including a darkly comedic story about a client's death and another about a caller whose girlfriend attempted to role-play while he was asleep. The segment concluded with another darkly humorous story about a man's disastrous encounter with a dominatrix.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Can we get rolling now?  Nepotism.  To come down the hall, I want to see when Russell Brand is scheduled.  Maybe.  It might be when you're not here.  I'll be on my cruise. 
[00:00:30]  Motherfucker, you might be off the hook.  I'll be on the cruise.  You might be off the hook.  I'll call in from the ship.  I have a satellite phone.  I'll call in just for that.  You can't get service out there.  Oh, I can.  Satellite phone?  Oh, yeah.  Sat phones?  No problem.  I learned after being lost in the woods on a hike with my chick years ago.  Hold on.  Yeah.  You were 200 yards from your car.  No, I wasn't.  You just didn't know what direction the car was in.  He makes it sound like he was on the Appalachian.  So if you're in a bunker, we're getting bombed and you're in a bunker, it's going to work? 
[00:01:00]  Well, no.  You need a line of sight for the sky.  As long as you're outside, you're okay.  How far were you from your car in the end?  Real far.  Come on.  We were walking for all day and actually two days away from the car.  Why two days?  Because it was the day we were hiking and then we had to spend the night in the woods and  then woke up and the whole next day in the opposite direction until we hit another trail  head on the opposite side of the mountain.  Why would you turn around if you went a whole day without buying your car? 
[00:01:30]  Because there were some rock cliffs that we climbed down and I knew my chick, not me,  I knew she wouldn't be able to climb back up.  So it was one of those point of no return things.  Like in a video game where you drop off and you know you can't go back any further.  Gotcha.  So it was that.  We dropped down and climbed down these rocks knowing that we couldn't get back up and had  to just continue going.  So after that happened, I decided I am getting a fuck.  Because you know what it's like to look at your cell phone and be like, here's your connection 
[00:02:00]  to the outside world.  I'm lost in the woods.  I really want to talk to somebody.  Oh, look at that.  It's fucking useless.  What if you climbed a tree?  I tried.  I tried.  You did?  Oh, yeah.  I tried everything.  There was no fucking signal.  Were you scared?  Whatsoever.  I started getting a little.  I wasn't scared at all the first day into the when it started getting dark.  I started getting like I don't I started thinking we're not going to be able to get  out of here tonight. 
[00:02:30]  Like you can't hike in the dark.  This was I mean rock cliffs cliffs and fucking everything logs everywhere.  You couldn't fucking walk in the dark.  So I'm starting to think I think we're fucked.  So I knew that there was I saw a sign that said lean to.  And it had a little directional thing.  And I guess a hunter's little lean to.  And I wanted to make that by the time we got night.  And we just made it by the nighttime.  It was pouring rain and cold as fuck.  And we woke up in the first like break of light and went to stand up. 
[00:03:00]  But you actually were able to sleep.  No, I wasn't able to sleep.  I kept looking and get this is great.  We went out so unprepared.  This is like one of those dumb motherfucker things to do.  Can I ask you something real quick?  Yeah.  Why would you go hiking?  You don't seem like a guy that hikes and definitely would have checked to.  Nope, I'm not.  Like I could see you going with a couple buddies, pitching a tent and just drinking beers.  Yeah, whatever.  Exactly.  Like in the backyard.  Eat some steaks.  Right.  Who do you think wanted to go hiking? 
[00:03:30]  Me or the chick?  Of course.  I fucking got talked into it.  Once again, easily influenced by a woman.  And then we get up to the top of this one little mountain thing where she goes, all right, we'll stop here.  We'll eat lunch.  So lunch, all the water, everything.  Because we're not that far.  So we go through everything.  And then she goes, oh, I remember as a kid when we used to come up here, we took the way up that we came.  But then we went down this way.  And all I was thinking was like, why don't we just go down the way we came up? 
[00:04:00]  And then I started getting the look like, bleh, bleh.  And I'm like, all right, we'll take the fucking way down.  You remember when you were fucking like six years old.  Yeah, great.  So we go down that way.  And I started knowing like really quickly.  I was like, are you sure?  And she's like, yeah, I'm positive.  And then after we did a couple of those drop offs where we couldn't turn around, then I was like, I started going, do you realize we're going back up a hill right now?  I go, it just changed. 
[00:04:30]  We're now going up again.  Up isn't out of here.  We went down.  We never went downhill and then uphill.  And then she's like, you look.  All right.  Forget it.  Forget it.  Keep walking.  Was there a lot of bitching going back and forth at that point?  Or were you working together as a team?  At the beginning, it was a weird.  There was a whole metamorphosis of emotions and all kinds of things that happened.  Because at first, it was very, we were like, I was annoyed that she did this.  And I was annoyed at myself for going along with it. 
[00:05:00]  When did you finally look at her and go, this is all your fault?  I never said that.  You wanted to.  I wanted to.  Boy, did I want to say, I fucking told you.  We should have went down the way we fucking came.  This is the dumbest fucking thing.  It's textbook fuck up.  Was it early in the relationship where you wouldn't say that, you think?  Yeah, early enough.  Yeah, early enough.  Because you know if it was like a year or two in, you would have been called a cunt and everything.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  It would have been one of those deals. 
[00:05:30]  But it was just kind of like, okay, whatever.  So I went down and started walking up the hill.  And I realized we're fucking lost now and couldn't find a way out.  We found the lean-to, went to sleep.  I couldn't sleep, though.  And get this.  It was freezing fucking cold now.  Cold rain.  She had a little fucking Jackie O red jacket.  And we had to try to share that to cover ourselves because it was freezing cold.  And all I was doing, and there was this, like, fog in the woods. 
[00:06:00]  And all I could do was look out of the lean-to into where you can't see anymore.  And I'm just waiting for something.  It's like a Stephen King novel.  Something to come out.  And rationally, you know that, like, look, odds are nothing's going to come out of there.  That doesn't help you, though.  It doesn't help.  In that situation.  I didn't want to shut my eyes because I imagined I was going to open them and a bear would be staring me right in the face or something.  So I just had a—I barely got any sleep.  Woke up.  Now, we've been walking all fucking day over rocks and things where your ankles are really taking like a beating. 
[00:06:30]  They're going in directions they never go.  And from the cold air and wetness and stuff, I went to stand up and fell right the fuck down.  I was crippled.  I couldn't fuck—now I'm really starting to think, holy shit, I'm not going to be able to get out of here because I can't fucking walk.  I'm crippled.  I'm going to be dragging my ass out of here.  And after getting up and standing up and walking around like I had a broken hip, I finally got enough, like, motion and blood back in my ankles and shit and the muscles moving where I could walk. 
[00:07:00]  And for water, thank God it was raining because we found this one fucking tree where the top was split open and it acted like a funnel and just like a waterfall was pouring out of this tree.  I was like, oh, thank you, God.  What kind of bacteria did you get from that?  I didn't get anything.  Fucking got really good.  The water was delicious.  It was great.  Now, we all have our breaking point.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what happened.  No, no, no, no.  What would have it taken for you to say every man for themselves? 
[00:07:30]  Because we all have it in our brain.  You think you don't, but you do.  They reached a point where I did crack a little bit.  We're walking and I honestly thought we were going to see something soon.  And when we didn't, we rounded a bend and it was just more wilderness.  I just started going, motherfucker, shit, but like cursing like a fuck.  This is bullshit.  We're fucking lost.  This is bullshit.  And she's just standing there knowing not to say a word. 
[00:08:00]  And so we kept walking.  I shook it off, kept walking a little.  And I noticed I was just walking further and further in front of her.  Like I wanted to.  Now I just want it out.  So I'm kind of chugging a little more.  And she's just kind of walking.  And I had to keep stopping and going, come on, come on.  And then a black bear came walking out.  Like it was a little one, but it was one of those.  You ever see a black bear?  They're like very round.  I've never seen one.  They're very round and fucking fat.  In the wilderness, never. 
[00:08:30]  And kind of like jostly and stuff.  You really saw a black bear?  Yeah, yeah.  I don't remember this part of the story.  Oh, yeah.  Walked right in front of the fucking trail we were on.  So I'm like, oh, God, fuck.  What do I do?  I go, I got to find some kind of stick just in case this thing turns around.  So I see this log on the side of the trail.  I pick it up, the thing just goes, it was like oatmeal when I picked it up.  Just this rotted, wet fucking piece of oatmeal.  And then I'm standing there just like, there's nothing I could fucking do.  If this thing, or if the mother was around or some shit, done. 
[00:09:00]  You got to think the mother was close.  Yeah.  So we waited for the thing to move on.  I said, just don't move.  And then we kept moving.  And finally, I found this little, there's this little box on a tree with a little hinge and stuff,  like a little mailbox, and inside was a pencil and some paper.  And I guess you were supposed to like, if you're fucked.  So I put our names on there and was like heading this way down the trail and popped it in there.  And then about another two hours later, we came to a trailhead, popped out on a road,  found a ranger station with this stoned ranger kid in there. 
[00:09:30]  That's like, oh, can I?  And we're fucking disheveled.  We walk in and they'd already known that we were missing.  Like the word was out that we were fucking missing.  How was the word out?  Because her mother was expecting us.  Oh, okay.  And she called like the state troopers and everything.  And like the word was out that we were missing.  Usually it doesn't end well.  I know.  Well, it did.  So we walk into this trooper, this ranger, and he's like, can I help you? 
[00:10:00]  And I'm like, yeah.  What do you think, asshole?  Look at us.  We were disheveled.  Yeah, we were lost in the fucking woods all night and shit.  He was like, oh, where?  I was like, I don't know.  We were lost.  We were back in the air.  It doesn't matter where.  I go, I know where we started.  It doesn't matter where.  So I go, I know where we started.  Could I get a ride back to our vehicle?  And he's like, well, I really can't leave.  I'm like, dude, we were fucking, like, it's either this.  I go, there's two scenarios that could have happened.  This, me walking in, are you going to hear about the two dead people in the woods? 
[00:10:30]  Can I have a fucking ride?  So he got us in the car.  He got us a ride back to my vehicle.  And there were two trooper vehicles there, a rescue vehicle.  There were all kinds of things.  And we come pulling up in a car.  Hi.  Hi.  We're back.  How far were you away from your vehicle?  We were fucking miles away.  Really?  We had walked probably in two days, maybe 15, about 15 miles.  Holy shit.  You were 15 miles away from your car? 
[00:11:00]  15 miles away from the car.  Oh, man.  You were a little off.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Take this way.  I remembered it when I was six.  Sounds like you were on the Appalachian Trail.  Does it go through that area?  I don't even know where I was.  I was on some dumb hill she used to climb as a kid.  So how long were you supposed to be there?  Like two days to hike?  No, it was supposed to be an afternoon.  Oh, just an afternoon.  It was just to go up this hill, eat lunch, back down the hill.  We were back in four hours.  Were you planning on banging?  Yeah, probably.  Did you guys talk about it or no?  No, not banging on the trail. 
[00:11:30]  Probably when we got back to the place where we were.  I don't like, you know.  And the weather wasn't really good.  It was kind of drizzling and shit.  Okay.  So there was going to be an after hike banging.  You didn't bang one out on the lead two?  Not on the lead two?  No, no.  Oh, yeah.  If I could have gotten a rod then, I would have been Superman.  Holy shit.  Did you have to drop a deuce, like, in the two days that you guys were lost?  No, there was, I think the nerves keep the shit in for a while.  Like, yeah, yeah.  You'd kind of get that nervous, eh.  But then the second we, the first thing we found was, like, a campground with water fountains 
[00:12:00]  and sinks and shit.  And it was just like, fucking never sucked down so much water in my life.  And then, yeah.  And you didn't have to go either when you were lost?  No, no.  It was really kind of a just, you have one mission.  It's just get the fuck out of there and don't die.  Right.  So, yeah, they gave us, like, the little blanket things at some fucking bar and drove us back  to the house, took a little report, and we were done.  But after that, I was like, I am never going anywhere without a satellite phone. 
[00:12:30]  Imagine, though, imagine if you're, like, walking way ahead, you're so aggravated, where  no, she's like, I got a shit.  And then she has to go.  And then there's, of course, there's no toilet paper.  No toilet paper.  You guys didn't prepare for that?  No.  She's like, what am I going to use?  And you just have to stand there and wait, waiting a little longer.  I probably would have had to, like, give her my underwear to wipe with.  I would have ripped my underwear.  I'd have ripped my underwear into sections and saved it for toilet paper.  Florentine has weird scenarios.  No, that's something that could absolutely happen. 
[00:13:00]  It gives a fuck what anyone smells like when you're lost in the woods.  No, because you can't hike with shit in your ass.  Because if someone wants to go hiking with me, I'm like, all right, we're banging at  least twice.  You're going to be up against a tree.  If I'm going to go walk through the fucking woods.  We're fucking.  I'm a grown man.  We're fucking.  Wear some of those fucking clothes.  Yeah.  That's a great story.  Yeah, that was the last time I fucking went hiking.  I'll never hike again.  I like hiking.  There's no reason.  Fuck that shit.  But the thing with the black bear. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Now, you let the black bear pass by and you saw it kind of disappear, right?  Yeah.  Wouldn't you think this black bear is right around every corner now?  That's what I was thinking.  That would scare the fuck out of me.  And then from that point on, I was.  I was looking everywhere like, where the fuck is the next monster in these woods?  I like being in the woods, but you start looking a little too deep in the woods and  your mind gets fucking weird.  Now the idea of going into the woods without a fucking gun and a satellite phone is retarded  to me.  Like, I don't know why I even did that. 
[00:14:00]  The only problem with the satellite phone, is it getting smaller finally?  Yeah, they're pretty small now.  They are.  Yeah.  How small?  I got one in my bag.  You want to see it?  Yeah, let me see.  Can you text?  He's got a go.  He comes in here with a go bag now.  That's not radio stuff.  This is your magnesium and your Flint fire starter because I couldn't start a fire either.  Yeah, I can start a fire on Fifth Avenue.  In case the zombies and the Puerto Ricans act up.  You never know.  He's ready to go.  One never knows when these people are going to start, when the race war will happen.  I'm not kidding. 
[00:14:30]  I got like one of those.  Natural disaster kind of stuff.  Jim.  You got a whole food thing in there like they have in the army that you could just eat?  Yeah, yeah.  MREs, things like that.  Do you have any of those?  I got some food.  See, I come in with an iPad and do a radio show and he's preparing for the apocalypse.  I got a cliff bar and a water.  Yeah.  A cliff bar and a water.  Look, he's got his go bag right here.  There we go.  We unzip this right here.  This is just the little go bag.  I have a good go bag.  And this is what he's willing to show us, by the way, Florentine.  He's got some other shit in there that he's not going to take out. 
[00:15:00]  This is...  That's kind of big.  It's big, but it's not fucking...  I'm not toting it around for fucking...  It's even bigger when you pull the antenna off.  Look at the fucking huge head.  But that's a satellite.  It's a charge?  Yeah, yeah.  So you have a...  Is that a carrot top prop?  No.  You're walking around with?  It's like Wall Street.  It is a Wall Street.  Oh, bye.  So...  It pretty much is as big as the Wall Street phone.  And I have a...  That's the phone they use in the first Arthur.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have a solar panel charger. 
[00:15:30]  Do you have a getaway plan to leave the city, like if there's an attack?  Yes.  I have a getaway bag, too.  I did a whole show on it on Live from the Compound the other night.  But do you have a whole plan, like how to get out?  Which highways are you going to take?  You can't take highways?  I think it's all dependent, though, on what's happening.  Like it's like...  Is it a nuclear plant or is it some kind of natural disaster?  Is it people just fucking, you know, society gone awry?  I don't know.  I just like having shit just in case.  All right.  Rush hour traffic around the city is horrendous. 
[00:16:00]  You think when there's an apocalypse you're actually going to be able to get on a road?  But he's already prepared.  He's going to be the first one in his car and out.  I just got to get out.  You need a bicycle to get over the bridges or a boat or a helicopter.  He'll get a cab and go, here's 500 bucks.  I'll get a cab, yeah.  Just take me over to George Washington.  Get me into Jersey.  Traffic's going to be at a standstill.  You're going to be too busy looking at the flying saucers in the air.  He'll be the first one running.  That's it.  I don't care.  I'll fucking take a boat.  I don't give a shit.  That river.  You need a boat.  And by the way, I did show in the go bag the most important thing is a gun because with 
[00:16:30]  the gun you could get anything else you need.  See, Louis C.K. was talking about his gold.  He goes, yeah, you know, I like always carrying a piece of gold with me, a little gold piece  because if money becomes worthless or something happens, he goes, you could always get something  with gold.  I go, that's why I like having a gun because I could take your gold with the gun.  You're not wrong.  So the gun and communication is like your two biggest things.  One of them wind up radios, you know, so you can hear what's going on. 
[00:17:00]  Then there's little packs of food and water, little water things, water filtration systems.  Who's going to be the asshole to do a radio show as the apocalypse is going on?  Wouldn't that guy want to get out too?  Somebody probably would.  I think it's more like, you know.  Somebody's going to stay behind?  Yeah.  You'd get some info.  There's hardcore radio guys.  It'll be Twitter.  Eddie Trunk would be on.  You got the Twitter.  You'd be fucking rocking to some metal tunes while you're trying to flee the area.  What about the Twitter, though?  You don't need that shit.  Twitter?  You just need the Twitter.  I don't think anyone's going to be tweeting either. 
[00:17:30]  You don't think?  No.  I don't think I could tweet on the satellite phone.  Wow.  Good point.  No Twitter.  That's just for the worst case scenario.  But there's other levels of it.  Like, do you just have to get out of the immediate area because a nuclear plant is fucking  doing something?  Did you bury your boat in the woods yet, like I suggested?  Did I bury?  Every good plant has a boat stashed away somewhere.  No, I didn't have that.  I could take a boat.  I could go to the North Shore and just take a boat.  How?  If all the boats are taken by all the guys that got there before you?  No one's going to take all the boats. 
[00:18:00]  You have to have a secret boat.  I'm telling you.  Do you understand there are guys with families that own these boats that have to get their  kids together and the wife and then get shit?  I'm ready to go.  The second something happens, I'm gone.  Have you timed how quickly you could get to the shore?  Three minutes.  You probably have.  Three minutes.  So you would head towards Long Island?  Fire in the hallway.  You would head towards Long Island instead of like Long Island Sound.  Because if I'm home, I'm home the majority of the time, which I live on Long Island,  I would head to the North Shore, grab a boat, and fucking head to either Connecticut 
[00:18:30]  or what?  I'm just going to tell you that everyone's heading in that direction.  So trick the zombies and the Puerto Ricans, go the other way, to the ocean.  South Shore?  Yes, no one's going South Shore.  Here's the problem.  It's a lot farther to get to some kind of land, and you've got to go through some heavy-duty  waters.  North Shore, you go across the Sound, you're in Connecticut, now you could cut over, you  could do a lot of shit.  See, I'm thinking North.  I'm going North.  Maybe even Canada, if you have to. 
[00:19:00]  Why not bury a jet ski?  What?  How do you bury a jet ski?  Then how do you dig it up?  Well, not bury it.  You know how they had the comm...  You don't have a shovel in your bag?  Oh, I do have a shovel in my real go-bag.  It's in my real go-bag, which is at home.  This is just a quickie.  But the go-bag I have at home has a military...  One of those shovels, they're like as big as your hand, but they fold out, and you screw  it, and boy, you're digging foxholes.  You ain't fucking around, Jim.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, I got a bunch of shit in there. 
[00:19:30]  Filter devices, all kinds of fire starting equipment, because I can start fire even if  shit's wet.  This shit's of magnesium.  Shit burns to like 5,000 degrees.  I'd be on to something.  You've got to just be prepared.  You know why?  Now I throw it in the closet, it's in there, and if something happens and you're like,  fuck, it's right there, and you're the first one out the house, first one heading to your  escape route, and other people are trying to collect up fucking canned goods?  Just blow me.  I didn't realize the interest in this. 
[00:20:00]  I just turned to my left for the first time.  Go-bags are huge.  In a half hour.  Go-bag.  The phones, they have a lot of questions for you, sir.  Let's go to John in Alabama.  We got Jim Florentine in studio, by the way.  John, what's going on?  Hey, who the fuck are you going to call?  Yeah, that's true.  Who am I calling on the satellite phone?  You going to call Katie Couric?  I'm calling the radio station that I get on my wind-up radio.  I'm going to get it.  Request a song.  It's a good question.  Who are you calling if an apocalypse is going down?  There's a room on the chopper for Mel. 
[00:20:30]  Look, would you rather have communication or not?  I'm not calling.  I'm not calling.  Look, look.  Hey, dummy.  I'm not fucking calling a friend of mine to see what he's up to tonight.  You could call.  He's not going to be talking to you.  You can call whoever you might need to call at the time.  You don't know.  It's a very fluid situation.  So you fucking, you go with your fucking Verizon plan or your AT&T and try to dial away. 
[00:21:00]  Or if you do hear something where there is someone or something or some place that could be helpful to you,  you try to figure out where you are while I'm just pulling up my fucking latitude and longitude on my phone  and telling people where I am so the chopper could get me, blow you, me, what?  All right, let me say hi to Ron in Georgia.  Ron.  Ron. 
[00:21:30]  What's up, Ron?  Come on, boys.  Love you.  Love yourself.  I do Ironman training to prepare for the apocalypse if it ever happens.  Ironman training?  Yeah.  2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, and then a 26 mile marathon.  I'm ready for when it happens.  That'll only get you 25 miles away.  That's great.  While you're huffing and puffing, I'll blast you one.  Right.  Thanks to Ronald Reagan for my military training.  I am prepared.  All right, sir.  Well, I think you need a little more than that. 
[00:22:00]  That's not in your bag, a 12-mile run, a 25-mile swim.  No, no, but I do work out.  Oh, yeah.  Let me say hi to Matt in Ohio.  Hey, Ed, I just want to make sure you have a handheld chainsaw.  Have you seen one of those?  Yes, I did.  I have one of those, as a matter of fact.  It's like a chainsaw blade.  You don't have to say it.  As a matter of fact, we just believe you.  It's like a chainsaw blade.  So what do you think you're going to need that for?  Well, if you've got to bring down a little tree or something.  I was under the impression of a shelter.  You might have to cut a tree down.  Where's a tree going to be in your way? 
[00:22:30]  Well, you know, you might need it for some kind of shelter.  It's New York City.  No, no, no, you're out.  You're out of the cities.  There's no city.  You're out of the cities.  So if a tree falls on the Connecticut Turnpike, you're going to come out of your car.  No, you might have to cut it.  I've got to get in.  You might have to.  Hold on.  You take your rowboat across the Long Island Sound, right?  Rowboat.  And it's still cities until you get past Hartford.  There's no trees until you get past Hartford.  But see, that whole situation is going to be bad.  Everyone's going to be in fucking traffic and bullshit and everything. 
[00:23:00]  You've got to go to a place where you know, like maybe a little northeastern parts.  But then you're in some rough waters, sir.  No, no, not past the point.  Oh, okay.  You're going up and then north, and then you've just got to deal with the woods.  And hence, you know, the little...  So like Providence, Rhode Island, maybe somewhere up there.  Well, you've got to keep going further.  Maybe Vermont, New Hampshire.  Vermont's not connected to the water?  No, no, in the woods.  No, you've got to go overland at that point.  Okay.  But where does the chainsaw come in?  Like, where do you think the... 
[00:23:30]  Let's say you're in the woods, right?  And you've got to set up shelter, and you need some wood.  You need some sticks to make poles and stuff.  But if there's like a radiation fallout, the woods isn't going to help.  Well, you've got to get as far away from the plant as possible from the radiation.  Are you talking nuclear war kind of thing?  Because then we're really...  Hold on.  We're on a map now, thanks to Danny.  So we're...  All right.  You can't go all the way out east to get in the water.  I'm going to stop at the Mohegan Sun and play a few hands of blackjack.  See, Danny's pointing at the easternmost point of Long Island. 
[00:24:00]  He's not going to go in the water there.  How about I just...  There's no way he would get to that point.  How about I just go straight across to Bridgeport and then...  Bridgeport?  Yeah.  And then I continue north.  Look, there's nothing there.  It's all green.  Well, there's a lot of green to the left of Bridgeport.  And a lot of black.  Or how about I go in and up the river and then I go up to Hudson?  You're going to want to deal with 95 during the apocalypse?  Thank you.  That's what I keep telling them.  No, I'm crossing right over it.  Where's the Connecticut River?  Crossing right over it.  Connecticut River's a good river. 
[00:24:30]  There's a river there?  How about I go west?  How about I go west and then go up to Hudson?  Now, whose boat are you taking?  Are you...  I'm stealing one.  And you're going to know exactly where to go?  Yeah, there's plenty of marinas.  I know where all the marinas are on the North Shore.  I've been to plenty of them.  Where are you going to find the Keys?  Keys schmieze, motherfucker.  It's a boat.  If you can't hotwire a boat, you're a retard.  You know how to hotwire a boat?  Yes.  It's easy.  You ever see fucking...  I have no idea.  It's not even like a car with a goddamn dashboard you've got to get into.  So why Keys?  What if the boat only has like a quarter tank of gas and it's only going to go for about an hour? 
[00:25:00]  There's gas stations.  No one's going to be...  Dorn the apocalypse?  There's gas stations right there.  All along the marina.  You don't think my bolt cutters are going to fucking be able to cut the padlock off of that thing?  Bolt cutters, chainsaws...  And believe me...  Shovels.  You're a landscaper.  Do you have a weed eater now, too?  I'll be edging for the apocalypse.  I'll be edging until the apocalypse.  And if I come wheeling up with an AR-15 and a couple of fucking 1911-45s strapped on me, 
[00:25:30]  I don't think all these guys at the gas station are going to be armed that quickly.  The trick is...  And let me tell you something.  And this is the reason I have everything ready to go.  The trick is speed.  You have to get the fuck going before everybody else decides I have to get going and gather everything up.  So leave now.  That's a good idea.  I'm out of here.  You might want some hedge clippers, too, because if you're in the woods and the pats aren't clear...  Should I get some hedge clippers?  Yeah, just...  That's heavy for a go bag. 
[00:26:00]  This guy wants to help you with your sat phone.  He's got a lot of numbers already programmed in there.  Go ahead, Bill.  In Missouri.  Hello, Bill.  Good morning, boys.  Hi.  I was just going to back Anthony up.  I guess you got Iridium, right?  What?  Yeah, yeah.  Your phone's right, yeah.  No, I put Department of Justice in it.  I put...  What are the three?  I got Department of Justice, Fox News, and...  Oh, the Pentagon.  You do a little research on the internet, you can find their...  Ah, see?  There you go.  Oh, you have a sat phone, too, sir? 
[00:26:30]  Yeah.  See?  An Iridium sat phone.  And he programmed in very pertinent, very good government...  Why is the Pentagon pertinent?  Because then you can say, hey...  Who the fuck's going to pick up a phone at the Pentagon during the apocalypse?  Oh, they're always there.  They don't go home.  They're like...  So you're going to tell them you're in the woods in Vermont somewhere.  I'm just going to say...  You're going to call a Pentagon.  I won't tell them where I am.  I'll just be like, hey, you got any updates on what's going on?  On the zombies?  You know, somebody...  And he goes, oh, wow, we haven't gotten many calls. 
[00:27:00]  And I'll say, yeah, because not many people have sat phones.  With the Pentagon programmed in.  And he'll be like, okay, well, here's what's happening.  Sat phone call, regular phones?  All soon.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I didn't know.  Oh, yeah.  It's a very handy.  Very handy item.  But how do you call...  See, you have a sat phone because the regular phones aren't going to work.  So if you call a regular phone, how are they going to pick up your call?  Well, that's just it.  If you have a regular phone, then you're shit out of luck.  So you have to get other sat phone numbers?  No, no, no.  No, if it's localized, if it's a localized problem... 
[00:27:30]  I think you're...  I think you're...  I think you've got holes in your plan.  No, I don't...  You don't even have a plan.  If there's an apocalypse, do you think someone's going to be answering the phone at the Pentagon?  Maybe.  Nah.  Maybe one guy.  We left the maid.  Because Washington's going to be in disarray.  Because Washington will be a mess.  It'll be a mess.  Yeah.  Think about how surprised they're going to be when the damn phone rings.  Imagine that guy...  Who the fuck is this?  Fucking Bill.  Right on, brother. 
[00:28:00]  That's funny, man.  His delivery was perfect.  Yeah.  See, you can pick it apart.  And I understand a lot of people...  Okay, okay.  Keith says drive south to him.  Boat is always fueled with all provisions.  That's right.  Okay, Keith, the cop has a boat.  I told you.  Go south.  The south shore.  So I can hit the south shore.  So all we need to do is just pick it up out of the driveway and dump it in the water and we'll be set.  Oh, it's not fucking in the water yet?  What is this, a seasonal Armageddon that we've got to deal with?  We've got to make sure his boat's in the fucking water? 
[00:28:30]  Keith.  It's not good for the apocalypse.  Fully fueled, yeah.  And I've got a very important call coming in.  Yeah?  I really do.  Okay.  Because you're talking about the apocalypse.  This guy wants to tell you how hard it was to leave after Katrina, which is a little different than the apocalypse.  Oh, don't even get me started.  Mark in New Orleans.  Before Katrina, trying to get out of New Orleans.  Yeah.  It was, you know, a normal trip across the Gulf Coast to have a house in Pensacola was like three hours.  It took us 18 hours on the highway going 10 miles an hour. 
[00:29:00]  Oh, my God.  That's fucked up with a week's fucking notice.  With a week's notice that it was coming.  The road was clear, you motherfucker.  And how many people in New Orleans had cars?  Yes.  There's a million people that live in the metro of New Orleans area trying to evacuate.  How many fucking million people are there in New York?  When did you try to leave, sir?  Don't lie, because I'll know.  We left like a day and a half before this.  All right.  And they knew it was swirling in the Gulf, headed your way.  And everyone waited and waited. 
[00:29:30]  That's what I'm talking about.  Rapid deployment.  Get out.  Get out.  Get out.  But you're going to have to guess when that is, Ed.  You've got to use your instincts.  The apocalypse doesn't tell you when it's coming.  It's going to be here.  No, but the second you see danger, that's when you've got to start making your move.  Those are the people that fucking make it.  Yes?  Opie, hand up.  Did you read the headlines today?  There's danger around us.  Not right around us.  It's on the periphery.  Can we break out a window and scale down to the street? 
[00:30:00]  You're better if there's no notice, because you're already prepared.  I'm ready to go.  If there's notice, that's when you're going to get fucked.  Right.  That's when I'll be fucked.  Like you're saying, you're going to be the first guy.  You're going to be leading the pack.  Got to get out immediately.  Take your go bag and go.  That's it.  Strap yourself up.  A lot of ammunition.  A lot of firepower.  And a lot of food and water.  Any bottles of liquor in there?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Captain Morgan.  The big, big jug of Captain Morgan.  That's heavy.  Because you've got to disinfect. 
[00:30:30]  Pete in Vermont.  And a medical kit.  Yes, I have a small medical kit.  With some band-aids.  Well, no.  It's a little more than just the medical kit.  You got iodine for the radiation?  I don't have iodine.  They're running out.  You better fucking buy yours.  I don't have those tablets for the radiation.  Pete in Vermont has a very good observation.  He's telling me to stay the fuck out?  Sort of, Pete.  All right.  What's up?  Hey, Ann.  About six minutes ago, you were lost in the woods with your girlfriend, scared of a bear cub.  And now you're going to come up here and face the apocalypse?  I wasn't prepared then. 
[00:31:00]  I learned my lesson through experience, sir.  None of us wanted to point out that it was a bear cub, by the way.  That's a great point.  It was a bear cub.  But I learned.  Now I'll never go anywhere without a gun and a sat phone.  You got a mirror on your gun?  For the people coming from behind, somebody wants to know.  No, you got to have a wingman there to cover your ass.  You're not waiting for anyone else.  I got to take Heath's boat.  There'll be other people in my group. 
[00:31:30]  Nah.  Yeah.  How many bullets you carry?  I swear, I'm looking.  I've been thinking about that.  Yeah, because that's important.  Ammo's very important.  So I don't know.  I think I'll load up a lot of 45.  I think 45 is good, and 45 is pretty common if you got to ransack any places that you might be able to find some ammo.  You don't want some, you know, exotic ammunition or anything like that.  So, yeah, I'm thinking 223s and some 45. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  That's about it.  Maybe three or four different pistols, just in case you got to dole them out to a few people.  You know.  You know.  Sounds like a party.  Your to-go bag sounds like it's going to weigh 200 pounds.  Well, you know what?  It's very.  For how much is it?  No, that won't last long.  Believe me.  If there's an apocalypse, I'm drinking.  The.  Last five years without opening them. 
[00:32:30]  And they're good for, you know, the emergency.  Like, that's the last case scenario before you drop dead.  But then there's also filters where you could take, like, a standard water bottle like this size and refill it and filter it 250 times through there.  And you could take shitty water and it filters all the bad gunk right out.  Just things like that that you might have to deal with. 
[00:33:00]  Okay.  I'm just saying.  We got another guy here.  He has a Tom Cruise scenario for you.  Oh, right.  Ross in Atlanta.  What's up, Anthony?  What's up, man?  Why?  How can Tom Cruise wrap up Armageddon in three hours with a bad script and two kids and you need a, you know, a 300-pound pack and an armor?  That's because that was bullshit.  Bullshit.  This is the real deal I'm dealing with.  I'm prepared.  Things happen.  I got a shitty house in Atlanta here you can buy if you need a backup place to go stash.  A safe house?  I need a safe house. 
[00:33:30]  Every good video game has a safe house.  You need a safe house.  You got safe houses out there?  Where you can sleep.  I don't have a safe house.  I know one good place, though.  Yeah?  I know one good place.  And I could even say it because no one would ever be able to find it.  What is it?  It's an old silver and turquoise mine in the Mojave Desert.  How the fuck are you going to get all the way out there?  You got to fucking be creative.  Now you're talking about aircrafts.  No, you got to be creative.  You got to somehow get your ass out because that is where no one's fucking going. 
[00:34:00]  And, you know, you got some shelter.  Now what route would you take there?  Would you take the boat to Connecticut?  I think I would take the boat across Route 66.  No, you'd have to then overland.  Yeah, you'd have to go, depending on where the catastrophe is.  You know, if it's north, you got to go south.  If it's south, you got to take the northern route.  You got to be able to – you can't have a set plan.  You know, you got to improvise, adapt, overcome like the Marines say. 
[00:34:30]  I hear you.  You know?  What are you going to do?  Let's go to Robert.  Robert.  Hey, let me talk to John Connor Cumia, please.  He's right here, sir.  Yes?  Hey, Anthony, your boat idea is a good idea, man,  because, you know, all watermen do not ever leave their boats empty in the marina.  Every boat is always filled, because they don't want water and the gas.  That's true.  That's right.  So, see, your plan for the boat is a pretty good idea.  Of course.  I've been thinking about the boat. 
[00:35:00]  That part's in good shape.  Or how about jacking a fucking plane?  Not so good.  You don't know how to fly.  No, not totally.  You do flight simulators, but I don't think you know enough.  I took an Experience the World of Flight course.  All right.  That's pretty good.  I got to actually hold the yoke.  How long do you think it's going to take you to hotwire a boat?  That would take long at all, I don't think.  No, no.  Once you get in there, the wiring's pretty simple for the ignition.  It's like old-school car ignitions on a lot of boats, especially old ones. 
[00:35:30]  Oh, let me see.  I'm getting another communique.  I have five cases of 40 cal and three cases of 45.  Can I come with you?  I would be proud to have you, Mike.  Oh, nice.  Let's just say that.  That would be some good firepower, having Mike.  The question I got for the people that are escaping the apocalypse, where are you actually  running to?  Because aren't you running to a place?  You're running to survival.  But aren't you running to a place where those people are running?  No, no.  See, here's the problem.  America is fat and lazy and unprepared and thinks nothing can ever happen. 
[00:36:00]  And what you will see are the fattest refugees you've ever seen in your life going to either  Mexico or Canada, whatever.  But big lines of people that look like they're from the show, heavy hoarders, things like that,  with canes, with little dogs, walking on these roads to nowhere.  And there will be a few, select few, that are scattered about the country, taking care 
[00:36:30]  of business, as they say.  TCB.  So that we may continue.  You're really losing your mind.  What?  Because it's happened.  It usually happens like every 10 years we have the apocalypse.  Well, probably a little longer.  The world's ended, you know, 17 different times over the last 200 years, so I can understand.  And what if...  All right.  Perhaps past performance is not indicative of future result. 
[00:37:00]  But...  Look.  If everyone...  You never know, my whole thing is, you just don't know the future.  If everyone's running away...  Yeah.  ...and being chased, why wouldn't you stay put?  And then, like, you know...  You know what I mean?  Because where?  Your houses aren't going to be safe.  Yes, it is.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  Because the people that are in charge of the apocalypse, they're chasing people the whole time.  No, this could be bad.  So if you stay put, they think your house is empty because you ran away.  No, see...  And then you're sitting nice in your compound.  Again...  So are these people going to go house to house? 
[00:37:30]  Well, again, it all depends on what the emergency is, where it is, how contained or widespread it is.  There's no definite plan of leaving the house, let's say.  See, I might just stay in my house.  There's no definite plan.  You might have to defend your home.  That's why I think you should start digging the tunnels I told you about the other day.  Tunnels?  Yes, you have a perfect house to start digging tunnels.  Why dig them if they're finished, my friend?  Why dig them if they're finished?  You got a mini compound under your pool? 
[00:38:00]  Ah, you never know.  You never know what's going on over there.  Maybe that's where all the water goes.  That's where the water in my pool goes, motherfuckers.  I gotta find where that water goes.  90,000 gallons?  Where could it have gone?  Oh, my God.  I think that dead tree has been drinking the whole thing.  I got a tree dying in the background.  What house is trying to figure out why their basement is full?  Wow.  Right?  Thank God I'm not on the downhill side of my pool.  Holy shit.  Did you really lose 90,000 gallons?  It was full.  I just checked under the cover.  It's completely empty.  No.  It's a built-in pool.  No.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  No?  Yeah.  Where the fuck's the water?  I don't know.  Wow.  Someone stole it.  I think it's the main drain.  Well, it has to be.  But no neighbors are knocking going, hey, do you have a leaky pool?  Because my house is a wreck.  How would they know?  It would just be like, we must have a leak.  It would have to be one of the houses right around you.  But it's probably slowly leaching through their cement basement walls, and they don't even know where it's coming from.  Someone in your neighborhood is pissed.  They don't even know.  They're probably like, wow, why is this chlorinated water coming in my house? 
[00:39:00]  No.  I don't know where it's going, to tell you the truth.  I'm going to have it fixed, though, hopefully, before the season opens up and I refill it.  Right.  But my water bill was atrocious last year.  I didn't know because I have an auto fill, and it just kept filling it up and filling it up.  And it was leaking out and leaking out.  And then I got my water bill, and it was 90,000 gallons of water I had gone through.  And it cost me like $420 water bill.  I went through 90,000 gallons of water.  You know, yesterday was Water Day, too.  Was it?  Yeah, for the world. 
[00:39:30]  I have a hell of a carbon footprint and a water footprint and everything else.  I don't know what the Water Day was all about.  I don't know.  I'm confused.  A lot of people saying, let's shower together.  It's 75% of the planet.  Stop with your water shortage.  It's desalination plants.  People are stupid.  Don't worry about the water.  This place is going to be spinning just fine without any of us.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  We've got to say hi to Jason.  Yeah.  Jason Stratham in studio, the star of Crank. 
[00:40:00]  I thought you said strap-on, then.  Strap-on.  Strap-on.  No one ever mistakes that.  Statham, actually.  Sorry, I did get that wrong.  Statham.  How you doing, chaps?  We're doing all right.  Very good.  You?  Doing pretty good these days?  Yeah.  Not too bad.  Getting some parts.  That's pretty nice.  Didn't you, like, start doing some kind of a car, almost like a car commercial short  film, and that kind of turned into, like, the Transporter series?  No, you're talking about the chap who did the BMW ads. 
[00:40:30]  That was Clive Owen, yeah.  That was, well, yeah, right.  You weren't in that?  No, I wasn't in that.  Damn, I thought that was in.  All right, I'm out of this.  Hold on.  I'm out.  I'm out of this interview.  By the way, that's the advantage of a pre-interview.  We could have cleared up a pre-interview.  Yeah, see?  We need a fucking pre-interview.  There you go.  Good, hopefully my stupid question got dumped out of because he cursed.  But that's fine.  It's nice to know that you're human, Anthony.  See, I learned something, because I thought that was you, for God's sake.  They told us Jason, like, does all his own stunts and stuff in movies, and I'm watching  him as he came in a couple minutes ago, and he sits like a maniac. 
[00:41:00]  You look crazy, because he sits, he has this sit, like, where he's, like, really slumped  down, and he sits like a guy who's an absolute lunatic.  Ready to pounce?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a problem.  He's already figured out how he could take out this whole room.  He's already figured it out.  I saw that as he was walking in.  Well, leading up to your appearance on our show, like, there were emails going back and  forth that you were going to do some crazy stunts today, and you wanted to do a Red Bull  drinking contest. 
[00:41:30]  Who said, what?  Jump off the top of a bus.  Oh, what the hell?  We were...  Open a window.  Come on, let's start.  Will you jump?  Jump out from the 14th floor?  No, we heard you wanted to do something crazy today, because you're going to do the walk  over with us to XM?  Yeah, I don't know.  I've never got told I was going to do something crazy.  You were going to dive under a bus, jump on a bus, I don't know.  Something.  Something about a bus.  People setting you up to do...  I was going to run somebody over with a bus.  Wait, you never got told you were going to do something crazy?  Who was Steve emailing?  Yeah.  Where is Steve?  This wasn't in the pre-interview?  No. 
[00:42:00]  We have a guy, he said he was going to be doing something.  You'll watch when he talks, just ignore his girlish hands and his stupid homosexual face.  As he talks to a real man.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  Steve might just break down.  You're dreamy.  If he starts to swoon, make sure you catch him.  He drives a hybrid car.  Yeah.  So he makes a lot of fun.  Yeah.  You got to make fun of that, right?  Here he is.  Here he is.  This is Steve.  Hello, Steve.  Microphone.  Take care. 
[00:42:30]  Just talking about your hybrid, Steve.  It's a sexy vehicle.  No, it's not.  What was going on?  Wasn't he supposed to do some crazy stunt?  Yeah, what are you talking about?  To promote crank?  What stunts?  In all the prep conversations I had with Roland about this, the backstory was that Jason was  going to do some kind of weird stunt on the walkover.  And I'm like, well, what does he want to do?  And that was all.  And there was, well, he's going to run on cars.  All right.  Why?  And then he's going to jump on a bus.  This is all.  Who said this?  This was all coming from our booker, who I don't know who he was talking to. 
[00:43:00]  I thought he was talking to you.  Get Roland in here.  Nice.  Pass the buck, Steve.  Thank you.  I like how Steve just passed it.  You'll notice everyone will now pass the buck.  Yeah.  And please have Roland say the name Tommy just once during his appearance on our show.  Roland.  Hey, get over there next to Steve.  All right.  Get over there.  Is it a present for me?  Now we'll hear pass the buck number two.  Roland is responsible for all the fine guests we get on this radio show. 
[00:43:30]  And I was watching at an event with him yesterday.  He recognizes nobody.  Really?  I'm like, is that 50 Cent?  He goes, yes, it is.  He's a 400-pound black guy in a hat.  He did look like 50 Cent, though.  I heard him.  We were walking.  He goes, Jay-Z is behind you.  And he wasn't.  No.  No.  He looked like Jay-Z.  An old woman.  Some security.  I'm like, why is Jay-Z wanding people?  All right.  So where are we at now?  Like, Steve is saying that you said that Jason would do some crazy stunt to promote Crank.  So have a good idea.  Opening at theaters Friday. 
[00:44:00]  We were trying to work out something, but then it just didn't happen.  It was just between us and other people.  So he had no clue.  But he has no clue.  Shouldn't he be the guy that's in on the conversation?  But we're going to pass out free Crank memorabilia during the walkover.  That's crazy.  Wow.  I hope no one gets hurt.  Yeah, but even when a guy does...  Wow, we're the most outrageous show on radio, I've got to tell you.  Can I have a safety mat for that?  Right, right.  Give me a harness.  So you were talking with people, and he had no clue about this. 
[00:44:30]  And you're, like, threatening him harm.  Harm could have come to him.  You guys are figuring this out.  They're like, I heard...  Because I heard...  I heard running on buses and cars.  Ride on the top of a bus.  And you would jump between two buses.  And you're just talking about this without his knowledge.  Possibly.  He's just going to plant all banana skins all over the walkthrough.  Oh, that's dangerous.  You could slip on those.  Oh, you'd fall down.  So wait, who were you talking to? 
[00:45:00]  Different people, though.  Different people.  Different people.  I would assume you weren't talking to yourself.  What is this, Fox News?  Yeah.  People are saying...  You don't have to mention their names, but what is their title?  We were just working out with the company to see if we could do promotion.  But shouldn't the guy be in on the conversation?  It's all very vague.  The syndicate.  I know.  I was talking with the syndicate.  All right.  Reagan gave better answers during the questioning.  Ah, well, you know, we were on with the company, with the man.  You're not fessing up. 
[00:45:30]  So, Jason, there's going to be no stunts today?  There's no stunts today.  Instead, this outrageous radio show will be handing out T-shirts or something?  Well, we have a laugh.  Sometimes you might hold one, and the wind blows it up in your eyes.  You get hit.  Be careful.  That could hurt.  Where's the shirts?  You're pretty much too big a star.  Oh, wow.  Danger money.  We're going to be handing out posters of Jason.  Don't pull that out.  And, yes, there's the T-shirt.  Oh, man, I want a shirt.  You know how sharp the corner of that poster is?  Look at that. 
[00:46:00]  We definitely put an eye out.  What's wrong with us?  My God.  You do your own stunts, or some of them, or more you used to, as opposed to now, because  now you're probably a little more important.  Well, now they start to get a bit concerned.  They're like, yeah, all right, maybe you should have someone else.  What was the craziest stunt you did in a movie?  In this one, I suppose, you know the skids of a helicopter, the landing skids.  So I'm standing on that, and we do a fight scene about 2,000, 3,000 feet above downtown L.A. 
[00:46:30]  You're sort of secured by a little hip pick and a small harness, and you've got plenty  of room to move about.  So, yeah, it's quite scary.  But you are hanging outside a helicopter.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't really realize how scary it is.  Wait, are you hanging from them, or are you standing on them?  You're standing on them, but you're having a lot of fights.  All right, so you're holding on, standing, and you're fighting.  So you're leaning back, and you're falling back.  Oh, my.  But as you're traveling up, all of a sudden, you think, no, I can handle this.  And then you get the old sewing machine legs start to go. 
[00:47:00]  It's that uncontrollable twitch.  You were scared.  And you go, you think you've bitten off more than you can chew.  So, yeah, you kind of scare yourself, but it's too late.  Man, how much driving do you actually do?  I do a fair amount.  But, you know, I used to screw around when I was a kid.  Yeah.  We used to drive, you know, from North London to South London.  All my pals, we used to race down there in the little GTIs.  So, yeah, I had a fair amount. 
[00:47:30]  But they probably cut back on that, too, right?  Guy's too important.  He's got another three pictures for this company, damn it.  We can't have them busted up.  Yeah, they don't tend to let you do as much as you want to do.  That's got to suck, because it sounds like you really enjoy doing your own stunts.  So you've got to be itching, like, oh, man, I could do a better job than this guy.  Hey, let me do this.  Well, usually, yeah.  I mean, if you think you can do it, you might as well do it.  Yeah.  But they just don't want to see you come to any harm.  Yeah.  I wouldn't do anything.  All right, let's say hi to... 
[00:48:00]  Stunt guy to tie my shoe.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jeff in New Jersey.  Jeff.  I'm a pussy.  Hey, just wanted to say, hey, Jay.  Good luck with the new movie.  Love the other two with Transporters.  Just excellent job.  Nice one, mate.  Thanks for that.  All right, you have a great day, and everybody else also.  Thanks.  That was inspiring.  That was...  Could have been the best phone call of the day.  Let's say hi to Andrea in New York City.  Andrea.  Hi.  Jason, you're gorgeous. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, yeah?  Oh, the chicks dig you.  Can you see?  You're gorgeous, yeah.  What was the name of that movie when you were the driver, and you had the sequel to it as  well, that was your big movie?  That was the Transporter films, I think.  That was really good.  I'm sorry, I can't remember.  That was awesome.  Thank you, Chris Farley.  You were so hot in those.  Yeah.  Wow, this is going great. 
[00:49:00]  We love the audience.  Good day, guys.  Bye.  Yeah, we'll try another one.  Keith in Philly.  Keith.  Yo, what up, guys?  Hey.  Jason, man, loved you in Lockstock.  Come on, mate.  You've got to say something funny.  Everyone's falling asleep here.  Yeah.  Did he have, like, a question about the movie?  What did you like about Lockstock?  The comedy.  I mean, I think he should be doing more comedies, man.  He's hilarious.  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody thinks so.  They're splitting their sides over him. 
[00:49:30]  Fucking handing out the red noses.  Well, no, it's just the callers today are a little slow.  We get that sometimes.  Certain days, the callers just call up and go, hey, Jason, that thing you did shot on 35 millimeter.  Yeah.  And they just run out of thought.  Yeah.  What was that movie where you were wearing the shoes?  Something about the shoes.  Shoes.  Right.  You were running, but the guy didn't come.  Heidi.  Yes?  Help us out here. 
[00:50:00]  Let's go.  I just wanted to talk to Jason.  He's here.  Oh, well, he's right here for you.  Talk.  Oh, Jason, I just wanted to say that I love your movies.  I've been watching you and Guy Ritchie films, Lockstock and Two Smokin' Barrels.  You're gorgeous.  Your accent is so sexy, and I just love you.  Every movie you've ever been in.  Nice.  Good man.  Did you like Snatch?  I did.  I love Snatch.  I love that movie.  I love Transporter, but...  And you love Snatch.  Lockstock and Two Smokin' Barrels.  I like Snatch.  We all love Snatch. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah, you got that accent.  I've talked about Opie before about Opie.  He's cute, too.  She's fickle.  All right, thank you.  All right, cool.  She's fickle.  She's like anybody who's kind of halfway decent looking and has money.  I don't blame you.  Where'd she go?  We're done with her.  So what were you saying, Ed?  I'm wondering how you even got into the business.  Well, I used to work, like, perfume and jewelry out of a briefcase on street corners for, like, forever. 
[00:51:00]  Hawking wares out of a briefcase?  Yeah.  A hustler?  A hustler?  Yeah, my dad used to...  Have you heard of the mock auctions?  It's like a big empty shop where you get all different wares up and you conduct kind of an auction.  But basically, you know, you're ramming people, as we say, with a load of crap.  And basically, my dad had one of those.  There was tons of those around in the sort of early 80s.  This was big in London?  Yeah.  Yeah, so the mock auctions, it was a big thing. 
[00:51:30]  So my father had that.  Wait, so I walk in, I'm thinking I'm getting something of quality and it's just junk?  No, basically, it's an empty shop and then you pull the pitch, which you basically lure people in, telling them, you know, you put them in promised land, telling them they're going to get a lot of stuff for nothing.  And that creates the crowd.  And then the top man steps up and they do systems where they, you know, they entice people to buy by giving them free gifts to go with a reduced price on a certain item. 
[00:52:00]  So it's like an auction.  Wow.  Basically, you know, you're sort of filling everybody up with a load of crap.  It's a scam.  So I learned, you know, I learned the spiel and the different systems that you can work within the mock auction and applied it to selling jewelry and perfume on the streets.  So basically, that's what I did for years.  And then Guy Ritchie had written a movie called Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.  And one of the characters within the movie was a street corner con man.  So there was no acting.  It was just me turning up and saying a few words. 
[00:52:30]  Would he just find you on the street or?  No, there was a, we had like a mutual friend, someone that was an investor, a wife of the investor, knew me and knew him.  So it was pure chance.  One of those lucky, yeah.  Lucky bastard, eh?  Wow.  So Guy Ritchie kind of made you, right?  He found you?  Yeah.  So, you know, he gave me a shot at being an actor, yeah.  Has he changed since being with Madonna?  I mean, I've known him since, you know, since day one.  So he's still the same old person to me.  Yeah. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Do you know Madonna?  Yeah.  I went to the wedding and that, yeah.  Look at you.  Nice.  A little starstruck.  Yeah, this is impressive.  Can I get a picture?  She's very attractive.  You're going to get a picture, aren't you?  Madonna?  No.  Oh, Jason?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's Crank about?  We haven't even talked about the movie yet.  It's about a hitman who finds out he's been poisoned.  He has an hour to live unless he keeps his adrenaline pumping.  Nice.  And buys himself enough time to find an antidote. 
[00:53:30]  And, you know, if he does that, he can get the guy who killed him.  Yeah.  It says Crank is in real time.  In real time.  That's what it says.  It's like Crank film running time is 83 minutes long and it's in real time.  So is every minute in the movie actually, I mean, like 24 every episode is an hour.  Is that what Crank is?  Like it's really 83 minutes in the life of a hitman?  Probably not.  Nah.  I wouldn't have thought so.  Then who wrote this up and gave me this awful introduction?  Same man who told you I was doing a stunt today. 
[00:54:00]  Wait.  I mean, I got distracted because I got to communicate.  What happened?  I just said to Jason.  I got to hear it now because I love when you get annoyed.  I just asked Jason.  What happened?  I figured I'd talk a little bit about the film.  He said it's about a hitman who is poisoned and has to keep his adrenaline going to find,  you know, to keep himself alive.  Yeah.  So I said, okay, so is it in real time?  And I figured he'd go, yes, it is.  And we'd have a chat.  Right.  And he goes, what?  And I said, well, it says the crank is in real time because it says it here. 
[00:54:30]  Crank film running time, 83 minutes long.  So I'm like, is that really like 83 minutes in the life of the hitman?  Yeah.  And he goes, no, I wouldn't think so.  You know, maybe.  I don't know.  Maybe they meant it's real time that you'll be sitting in the theater.  Oh, which is pretty much like, how about saying that crank is a visual as well as auditory experience?  What dummy wrote this and where did you get it?  Let's say hi to Darren.  We've never had as much erroneous information as we have with you sitting here. 
[00:55:00]  Roland did?  What's Roland?  Roland made it sound like we were going to have an action adventure today.  A real time stunt extravaganza.  Roland, what's going on?  We got him in wrong movies.  He's not doing stunts.  It's not in the real time.  It starts like once he gets injected, the 60 minutes starts.  Oh, yeah.  So there is an hour time frame.  Yeah, hour time frame.  Like once you get injected, it's like an hour from.  Wouldn't he know he's in the film?  Yeah.  Thank God you know because I didn't have a clue.  Have you even seen your own film yet, Jason?  Not yet, no.  All right, so maybe we know more than that. 
[00:55:30]  It's a romantic comedy, I think.  Roland looks like a gay Napoleon.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, no.  Here come the photoshops.  Oh, no.  Hey, let's say hi.  Where were we going?  Darren in Kings Park, I believe.  Darren, what's up?  How are you guys doing?  Good, man.  Hello, Darren.  What's going on, O&A?  All right, we're rocking.  Cool.  Jason, got a quick question for you.  I heard on the set of The Italian Job, you and Charlize Theron, I heard she, you know, 
[00:56:00]  thought she all brage old.  What's that, mate?  Can you speak English?  He's basically insinuating that there was some kind of a romance.  You may have got a little piece.  Get out of it.  Charlize Theron.  She's got a boyfriend that I know quite well.  Now you got your information wrong there, sunshine.  No, not at all, huh?  Nah, nah.  All those rumors get going whenever you make a movie together with, like, you know, attractive 
[00:56:30]  girl.  Have you been talking to me?  Is Wahlberg a fag?  Is Wahlberg a fag in real life?  What do you say?  Is Mark Wahlberg a fag?  No.  Why would you?  Why am I answering?  I don't know him.  Why would he be?  I mean, come on.  What makes you say that, anyway?  This guy got one of Roland's sheets.  Yes.  He's reading off it right now.  Jason hooked up with Charlize Theron, and Mark came in, but then Mark was only interested  in jail.  What did you hear?  There's crap.  Hey, we've got to take a quick break.  We've got Otto and George.  We've got Jason Statham. 
[00:57:00]  Crank opens on Friday.  You're hanging, obviously.  I just got to communicate.  We've got to take a break, because Edward Norton wants to call in and say hi.  Oh, nice.  You know Edward?  Yeah, I know Edward, yeah.  You know Edward?  Edward, okay, he's going to be calling the show in a few minutes here.  Oh, great.  The Illusionist is out.  Is it out yet?  Yeah.  I just saw it.  It is out.  I saw it last week.  Don't ask Roland.  The reviews are amazing on this film.  I took it on vacation.  Everyone that I went on vacation with saw the movie and absolutely loved it.  Oh, cool.  I'll tell him.  Absolutely loved it.  You'll tell him you took a bootleg copy and let everybody watch it? 
[00:57:30]  Oh, great.  What?  It was a legal copy, wasn't it?  Yeah, it's out Friday-wide.  God, we've got to get rolling on the show more.  Wow.  Wow.  It's out Friday-wide.  Are you sure it's Edward Norton?  He probably scheduled me for a phoner.  Why are you so nervous?  I don't know.  I'm tired.  Wow.  That was one of the worst. 
[00:58:00]  It's out-wide.  Friday-wide.  It's out-ia.  I'm-a-ha.  Who's calling?  Ed Norton.  50 Cent, possibly.  That would be great if he recognizes nobody.  I'm surprised he knows who you two are.  What about Mr. Lee?  Is he going to be calling the show soon?  Mr. Lee?  Yeah.  Rockstar?  Oh, yes.  In two weeks, he's coming to New York.  Wait, what's his name again?  Tommy Lee.  Oh.  Wait, wait.  Wait, who? 
[00:58:30]  Tommy Lee.  Don't you say it, by the way?  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  Tommy Lee.  What?  What time is that with Norton calling?  Between 830 and 835.  All right, we've got to take a break.  That's Mexican food, isn't it?  Tamale.  Tamale.  It's the worst of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We've got to get right back into this.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Spreading across America.  We've got Jason Statham.  Sorry.  I can't say your last name.  Hello, everybody.  And on the phone, a new friend of the show. 
[00:59:00]  Edward Norton.  Wow.  I'm waiting, waiting, waiting.  Here we go.  Ed Norton.  Edward.  Edward.  Edward Norton.  How are you?  What's up, buddy?  There he is.  How you doing, man?  Jim Norton, my brother.  How you doing?  Yeah, it's your brother.  That was the first thing he said to me when I met him.  I didn't know what to say to Edward Norton.  I was really starstruck.  And he goes, my brother's name is Jim.  I'm like, oh, cool.  And I just stood there with nothing to respond like an idiot.  But we have someone. 
[00:59:30]  You've just done the routine about your nipples, I think.  He remembers that.  He saw me at the cellar.  And it was a really good show.  And I did something on my nipples.  And he just remembered.  I think he commented.  Oh, thank you.  It's true, too.  I can't function without it.  And again, I just can't stand when a big Hollywood star recognizes Jimmy.  You know, there's people like Edward and myself, men of our ilk.  We tend to, you know, band together.  Enough of your ilk.  Had it with you and your ilk.  Hey, we got a friend of yours in studio. 
[01:00:00]  Someone you might know there, Edward.  Who's that?  How you doing, Edward?  It's Jason.  Jason Statham?  Yes, mate.  What the hell are you doing there?  Exactly.  Yeah, the show's a bit hard up.  They thought they'd get me in.  Bring you in for a bit of the old Cockney, right?  Well, he was supposed to do some over-the-top stunt for us, but I guess that's not happening.  Now we're just going to be handing out posters today or something.  For Crank.  He's going to sell you a fake Cartier.  It went severely downhill. 
[01:00:30]  Did you hear that, though?  He's going to tell you the joke about the guy with the alligator on the bar and the old lady in the corner.  I'll tell you, apparently Edward does a really good impression on me, so you might want to hear it.  Well, he said something about selling a fake Cartier, so I guess he knows your history, right?  Yeah, he does, yeah.  You know, I owe him a refund.  Jason was the one redeeming factor in the experience of the Italian job.  Yeah.  Oh, is that a bad one?  A bad time?  Oh, no, no.  I'm teasing him.  It was a great gang. 
[01:01:00]  That was the best part of it.  Is this joke worth hearing?  Can we hear it, Jason?  No, Edward, if you want to go ahead, tell him.  No.  I think nobody can tell it.  I can't tell it like Jason.  Whenever I tell it, I try to sound like him, and it's not as good.  There's a lot of swearing.  Oh, is that funny?  Of course there is.  He knows you can't do it.  Hey, Roland told us, and Roland has been really weird with information today.  He's been giving us all the wrong info.  By weird, he means completely wrong and inaccurate.  Completely wrong.  So did you just get your pilot's license? 
[01:01:30]  Not just, but a couple years ago.  A couple years ago?  All right, at least it's the proper information.  It's just years old.  Okay, Roland made it seem like he got this like yesterday.  He's like, oh, it just happened.  No.  No.  Again, Roland is wrong.  He's cringed in the corner.  You do a lot of flying?  I do, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah?  It's a passion.  Got your own plane?  I do.  Nothing fancy, you know.  You're not like John Travolta with a big 707 in your backyard?  No, no, no.  I've got to make a lot more big, dumb movies to afford one of those. 
[01:02:00]  Hey, can you fly, I guess, what do they call it?  Instrument qualified?  I mean, can you just fly?  You can fly at night and all that stuff?  Yeah.  That's what JFK Jr., when he was flying, he wasn't qualified, so at night he didn't know  how to use the night stuff.  Was that his big problem?  Yeah, he wasn't instrument rated.  Okay.  VFR, Jimmy.  VFR.  What's that?  Visual flight rules.  I'm trying to have a discussion about flying.  I don't know anything technical.  I just like, does it have wings?  You're way out of your element here.  I know, I'm just trying to sound smart, so I asked the instrument question, but I said 
[01:02:30]  it like a novice idiot that I am.  Well, good, so two years ago he got his pilot's license.  That's great.  You want to talk about his new movie, Fight Club, you idiot?  He's got this kid in it, Brad Pitt, he's going to knock you out.  Yeah, I hear that kid's going places.  I also see, now this I've got to ask you about, you've been on David Letterman?  I have been.  Okay, very good. 
[01:03:00]  Me and Opie are doing Letterman tonight.  Really?  It's our first time ever.  Look, he's shocked too.  I know, I know.  Everyone we tell is shocked.  It is shocked.  Everyone is shocked.  But I need some advice.  What do you do?  You walk out there.  Are you nervous?  You sit down.  What's the first thing you do?  Yeah, go back to the first time you were on Letterman.  Yeah, first time.  What was that like?  The first time I did it was the best time.  I can't say why.  You know, last time I did it, I felt like I talked too fast. 
[01:03:30]  You know, I think you've got to slow down.  Okay, don't talk fast.  Let me write that on my hand.  I'll write that on my hand so I get that.  Well, it's the temptation, right?  Because there's an audience in front of you, you know you're being watched by a lot of people,  and you just kind of feel like this urge to fill any vacuum of silence.  Yeah, that's right.  Did Dave help you out?  Don't keep, like, putting your fingers in your pits and then checking the smell.  Damn it.  I was going to do that.  Did Dave help you out?  Like, was it smooth?  He's great.  You don't have to.  He's right there with you. 
[01:04:00]  And did you drink at all before you went on?  I did not.  See, Luke Wilson told us to drink.  Yeah, Luke Wilson said have a couple of Heinekens before you go in there.  Yeah, there's that.  I drink something warm.  I'm telling you, it is cold in there.  Be ready.  He likes his comedy served cold.  That's what everyone says is how freezing cold it is in there.  Like 50-something degrees.  Like, he's legendary for liking a very perfect, you know, Jim's nipples.  They would harden up really nicely.  I would wear just, like, a white T-shirt and show them off. 
[01:04:30]  You might want to put Band-Aids on them or something.  Some pasties.  Oh, okay, that's good advice.  Don't talk fast.  Don't put your fingers in your armpits and smell them.  And slow down.  And slow down.  Edward Norton, The Illusionist, getting great reviews.  Yeah, it's a lot of fun.  I think, you know, in the vein of ones I've done like Primal Fear or the score with a good twist at the end,  this is, you know, it's an entertaining night at the movies.  I watched, I'm sorry, I watched, I hope you've seen it.  I have not seen it.  I have only seen it.  No, I haven't seen The Illusionist. 
[01:05:00]  I got, maybe I shouldn't admit this, but, you know, I got a copy because, you know, we're in the know.  Is that okay to say I got a copy?  You know, because it was a studio copy.  Yeah, to preview the movie because we were going to talk to Edward Norton.  I went on vacation.  I was doing some boogie boarding and I never got to see the film, which I'm bummed at.  But everyone else in the house, because it was a house filled with, I don't know, 15 to 20 people.  They all saw it and they thought it was unbelievable.  And they were trying to tell me this twist thing at the end. 
[01:05:30]  I'm like, don't tell me until I see the movie.  But they loved the movie, Edward.  Good, good.  Yeah, it is fun.  There's some great actors in it.  Paul Giamatti is one of my favorite guys out there right now.  And it was a kick to work with him.  And Jessica Biel was hot.  Yeah.  I feel like her.  The previews I was watching, we don't have the sound on the televisions here.  So the preview just kind of showed you the stage was black and you were doing something  and you're rushing to kiss a girl.  But it had a vibe like, the only description was magic with Hopkins. 
[01:06:00]  That was for some reason what it reminded me of, that just like a really chilling, creepy  kind of vibe.  What type of character are you?  It's a little more romantic than magic.  But it is a dark mystery.  You know, it's kind of got elements of the supernatural in it.  And it's a lot of fun.  Let me ask you this.  As an actor, what I do is I basically...  Oh, boy.  I'd like to talk acting with Edward Norton because that's what I need help with. 
[01:06:30]  All right.  I basically read dialogue and I just pray that they can't see through my flimsy performance.  It's an honest assessment.  That's what I do.  It's just like, blah, blah, blah.  All right, they said rap.  All right, good.  We're done.  Do you...  Are you like...  My turn, my turn.  Yeah.  I love that bit.  That's what I do when they're talking.  I just think, not my turn, not my turn.  And then I hear my cue word and I go talk, talk, talk.  And then I stop.  And then hopefully they'll talk without yelling, cut, redo that.  Do you...  Are you like...  I know this is like a novice question, but are you like... 
[01:07:00]  Are you considering yourself a method actor or what method do you use or do you not use  one in particular at all?  I never...  I mean, I think that's a word that gets tossed around a little too loosely.  I'm not sure I believe in anything for everything.  You know what I mean?  And I think it's like...  I think everything's...  I mean, method acting doesn't help you much on Death to Smooch.  You know what I mean?  It's like...  So I think you've got to tailor it to the moment.  We were doing a lot of method acting on the Italian job, weren't we, Chase? 
[01:07:30]  Oh, tons of it, yeah.  I mean, we were deep inside those characters.  Well, very deep.  We were deep inside those Cooper Minis.  Yeah, something tells me there are stories that go on with those movies where there's  a big crew of you guys hanging out that just will never, ever get out.  Some of those stories.  Just cruising around foreign countries.  Sworn to secrecy.  Impregnating women.  Causing problems.  Problems.  That's always, you know, the settlement.  Yeah. 
[01:08:00]  Jason seems like...  This is my impression of Jason.  When he came in, he seems like a really nice guy, but who has a switch where he just turns  into a sociopath immediately.  Jesus.  Yeah, so he just seems like he's...  Yeah, he's giving you that look now.  Push me that sharp knife.  But he seems like he's...  You know, make me angry when I'm angry.  Is that what he's like?  Is he pleasant for a while, and then there's a problem, and he just starts biting people?  I don't know.  Somehow I stayed on his good side.  I'm a peaceful man.  I'm into knitting and flower arranging. 
[01:08:30]  He's another one of these guys that would headbutt you.  Yeah.  We were just talking about this the other day.  You would headbutt us, make it hurt real bad, and smile the whole time.  Well, any guy from England with a shaved head, we all assume, is a soccer hooligan or something,  where there's just headbutting going on, and then beer drinking, and laughing.  Who was that guy, Jason?  We used to talk about the gent.  No, no.  Who was Lenny the...  Lenny McClain.  Lenny McClain, right?  Yeah.  He was a method actor.  Yeah.  What was he?  No, he was actually a bare-knuckle boxer. 
[01:09:00]  But I can remember in one of his interviews, someone said to him, they were interested in  his technique, and they said to him, they were saying, like, Lenny, is it true you never  went to drama school?  And he went, listen, I've had a thousand ballroom brawls.  I've been shot four times.  I've been stabbed a dozen times.  Isn't that enough drama for anyone's fucking lifetime?  Lenny McClain.  Wow.  You know how you look at other men and what they do, and you realize you're in the same 
[01:09:30]  kind of genetic competition?  It's like, that's what I'm up against, like, as a male, to survive.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  That's good.  You're a nice, self-confident girl.  Well, you know.  That's just how the DNA's mixed.  You know.  What are you working on right now?  They said you're shooting something right now.  Uh, no, I'm, uh, I did a film with Naomi Watts that we made in China last year that's coming  out later this year that I actually like a lot, and, uh, but I'm, I'm taking a, I'm taking 
[01:10:00]  a little break.  Okay, relaxing.  Yeah, you're just trying to do a movie with every hot chick in Hollywood.  Is that your goal here?  Well, it took me, like, ten years to realize I was making movies with all the wrong people.  I was, like, making movies with Jason and Mark Wahlberg and Brad Pitt, and it's like,  that's not sexy.  Good decision, man.  And then you do one or two with one of these girls, and, you know, you go, wait a minute,  like, what was I carrying about artistic, you know, uh, you know, ambition for it?  It's like, this is what it was, this is why I got into this in the first place, to meet 
[01:10:30]  girls, you know?  Yeah.  That, that is at least honest.  It's great.  I mean, that's why most guys, I think, become, uh, entertainers of some sort, is you get  tired of seeing chicks run off with jocks, and you decide, this is what I can do.  Jessica's ridiculous, huh?  Is she just so hot?  See, I didn't know, when we were going to make the movie, I, I didn't, if I'd known  she was, like, you know, the, whatever, Esquire Magazine sexiest woman, I'd have paid  more attention to her.  I know.  No, I'm kidding.  I, uh.  Yeah.  No, no, she's, she's a great girl.  She's a great girl.  She's actually kind of salt of the earth. 
[01:11:00]  She's a real tomboy, and, um, real, real fun to hang around with.  Really, really solid, solid girl.  Solid's a good word to use.  That's an excellent word to use.  Well, dude, you, see, this is what you gotta do.  When you're working with guys like Brad Pitt, and you're working with guys like, uh, you  know, that handsome, you gotta work with really awful looking people.  You don't want to surround yourself with Mark Wahlberg.  I mean, even though Dirk Diggler is not his real life, every woman wants to find out  if he's really packing like that.  So you gotta surround yourself, like I was on a show, and, uh, I'm mediocre to horrible 
[01:11:30]  looking.  Everybody else on the show were genetic disasters.  I was the best looking nothing on the show, so I was like the sex symbol of the show, if  that makes any sense.  Wow.  So it's who you surround yourself with.  You need relative comparisons.  That's what I'm saying.  You don't want to work with Brad Pitt and Mark Wahlberg.  That's tough.  Yeah.  I'm going to pull it off, because you're a handsome person.  I mean, it's kind of awkward to say that to another man, but it's true.  And then he can, you know, hop in the plane.  What kind of, what kind of, uh, license you got?  Your jet?  No, no, no.  I'm not, not playing those.  Dual engine? 
[01:12:00]  Um, no, no.  So you're hopping around a little 172?  No, no.  A little better than that.  A little, a little faster than that, but.  Okay.  I figured that.  What is your, uh, maximum distance you can go with it?  Like, can you fly to actual locations or no?  Yeah, yeah.  I can go maybe a thousand miles.  Jesus.  Studio must love when he goes in the air.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  So when does he land?  What time?  Call me as soon as he lands.  Call me.  As soon as he touches.  Did they, let me, did they make you sign stuff, like, uh, that you won't fly while you're  shooting this particular film?  You know what?  I, I, they, they probably do. 
[01:12:30]  I, I, I can't really remember.  I love that.  A little look at things that he signs, uh, kind of lawyers and stuff.  Do you find yourself not flying at all when you're in production?  Well, some, last year I was, when I, like, when we did the illusions, we were in Prague  the whole time, and then I was in China, and not a lot of civil aviation in China, let  me put it down.  No.  Yeah.  Shoot you right out of the sky.  You don't really like people, uh, flying around looking at things.  Yeah.  You take a little friendly flight, there's F-14s telling you, it's probably not smart. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  American plane in China, sure.  All right, we're running out of show here.  Yeah, really.  And it's getting, uh, just great reviews.  It's, it's just another great, uh, film, uh, that you're in there, Edward.  Thank you.  And, uh, I, I highly recommend everyone go see it.  Yeah, I hope people check it out.  Yeah, I think they will.  I really do.  They will enjoy it.  We're, uh, we're big fans, man.  We're really glad you called it.  Yeah, absolutely.  If you're ever in New York, you gotta, you gotta stop it.  Yeah, you live in New York?  I, I was reading just, uh, as we're doing this, that you still take the subway? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, all the time.  It's the fastest way to get anywhere, you know that.  Yeah.  But, but do you get recognized on the subway?  No.  No, but, you know, they, they, they know I'm friends with Jason, so they leave me alone.  They leave me alone because there's a problem.  But are they looking at you like, um, that, that, that's Edward Norton, he's on the subway.  Like, God, that guy looks a lot like that guy in, you know, play club.  But it can't be, because he wouldn't be on the subway.  You disguise yourself?  You know, I mean, it depends on where you're going.  Yeah.  See, I don't, on the subway, I would think you would have to, like, wrap yourself up. 
[01:14:00]  Dude, I'm so desperate for attention.  I actually get on the subway holding a microphone and a little PA in case people don't know what  I do for a living.  I need any angle to get into a girl's pants.  Comedy's the only way in.  He's got the Ed Norton mask.  I can get you a mask.  Hey, anytime you want to.  Give me a mask of you and I'll give you a mask of me.  All right, so that means that I'll get laid and you'll never get work again.  I'll get into the Comedy Cellar, though.  Oh, you can come to the Comedy Cellar whenever you want, man.  We'd love to have you come in here, too.  Whenever you want, you can open an invitation. 
[01:14:30]  That's right.  Jason, where are you?  I'm just stuck out here for another day and then I'm coming back over to L.A.  To L.A.?  Yeah.  All right.  Well.  And his movie, Crank, starts Friday as well.  Oh, there's a little competition here.  No.  By the way, I told you I saw your movie, didn't I?  Which?  The Illusionist.  Oh, no.  No, I thought I told you when I saw you the other week.  Yeah, it's brilliant.  Oh, good.  Thanks.  Yeah, superb.  All right, so you've got to see...  I'll catch Crank when I get back. 
[01:15:00]  Yeah.  Do we get some good martial arts in Crank?  Not really.  Not a ton of fighting.  It's just a bit of fun, you know?  It's like a silly sort of video game type film.  Wow.  Yeah.  Not many girls apart from Amy Smart, who does take it over a newspaper stand.  In a very lovely way.  It's pretty hot.  Really?  He's got to keep his adrenaline up.  Yeah, it's a funny scene, actually.  In front of 250 extras, you've got to try and, you know, keep your hairy ass out of sight. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, really?  Nice.  Well, I don't have a hairy ass, so I wouldn't.  Oh, you shave it, yeah?  Must run in the Nortons.  Yeah, I'm actually a very smooth-bottomed boy myself.  It's the Irish.  All right.  Edward Norton, thank you.  It's always a pleasure.  All right.  And, Jason, it was great meeting you.  Nice talking to you.  Absolutely.  Nice to meet you.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Well, the haircut is our favorite.  Oh, the women. 
[01:16:00]  It's such a sensible haircut.  It's so easy to take care of.  Look, man, there's a lot of people getting ready to go on the Long Island Railroad.  Yeah.  Well, we'll keep it local for New York.  We don't do that often, actually, even though we broadcast from New York.  On the Long Island Railroad, if you go in later, actually, because you've got all the businessmen coming in and the businesswomen that have to look like hot pieces of asses so they can get their raises.  Right.  Break through that glass ceiling.  So you're not going to see the women with the really short haircuts in the morning.  But later on in the day, if you're one of those people that have to take a train a little later on, you'll be on a train with all these people coming in to watch a taping of some TV show. 
[01:16:30]  And just count all the sensible haircuts you'll see on the train.  It's sensible.  I have to get out of the house, make sure all my kids are off to school, and then get out of the house and do my errands.  So I can't really spend time washing a big, long, lustrous head of hair like I used to have.  So I've chopped it all off.  I've given myself a crew cut. 
[01:17:00]  And I'm sure your husband loves it.  I want a girl who's a whore who has to feather her hair and look good no matter where she goes.  I like that.  A nice, nice head of hair on a girl.  Isn't that nice?  Something to grab onto.  Yeah.  Something to run your hands through.  You know, this marriage thing, you should be able to renew your marriage.  We talk about this from time to time on the show.  Get a license renewal, like after with your car.  Yeah, like after, you know, you sign a contract. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  Maybe you're brave enough when you're getting ready to get married, you go, you know what, I'll sign a 10-year contract with you.  And then you've got to re-up.  And then after 10 years, you renegotiate.  Yeah.  Like everything else in this life.  It's like sports.  As long as you're performing.  Right.  Then you're going to get paid.  Your team is going to re-up you and you're going to get paid.  And things are going to work out.  And you get bonuses if you do it the way it's supposed to be done.  Right.  You know, like if you wear, you dress a certain way, like crotchless panties and, you know, you keep yourself a certain weight. 
[01:18:00]  That's it.  And this should go for both sides.  If not, you get black guys.  Because the guys wind up looking like old women, big guts on them.  Something happens.  They lose all testosterone and they look like old women.  And you're not getting re-upped.  The wife or the husband, if it's happening to him, turns and goes, you know, I'm looking over your past performance now over the past couple of years and you're just not performing.  Can we do something today? 
[01:18:30]  Actually, Dan came up with it.  I can't take credit for this one.  Dan in New Jersey.  I got an idea after Dan's phone call, though.  Go ahead, Dan.  All right.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Amen.  Yeah.  You know, I married a stripper and after years the hair got shorter, the weight went on and what happened to my balls, you know?  It's pretty much gone.  But that's all I got for you guys this morning.  I'm punching out.  No, no, no.  I'm going to take your phone call and we're going to do something fun today for the next half hour. 
[01:19:00]  Dan, how much did she weigh when you got married?  She was a stripper.  She was a stripper.  About 118, 119.  Hot.  How many years have you been married?  21.  21 years.  How much does she weigh now?  241.  Holy God.  You're kidding, right?  No.  No, I'm not kidding.  The hair used to be long and blonde and now she looks like a bullseye. 
[01:19:30]  Two.  Oh, my God.  She doubled her size.  She did double her size.  She doubled her weight.  Oh, yeah.  Easily.  She gained 123 pounds in 20 years.  She's still a stripper, but now she's stripping cow carcasses of their flesh.  Let me see if we can make lemonade out of lemons.  Is she made of gold?  That's the only way that would work.  Look at all the gold I have now.  She eats cows like we eat sushi.  Nice. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, that is a shame, man.  You're not kidding, right, Dan?  It is.  I mean, you know, two kids later, I, you know, I've seen people with four kids later.  All right.  We got a lot of women screaming at their radios right now.  Dan, how much did you weigh when you got married?  178.  How much do you weigh now, 21 years later?  179.  He gained a pound.  Wow.  He's gained a pound.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  See, you know, maybe it's a small group. 
[01:20:30]  Marriage should be a contract.  I'm telling you, if you're brave enough to, you know, sign a 10-year contract, great.  But maybe you should start at, like, five years.  Five-year contract.  After five years, you decide what you want to do at that point.  Dan, do you say anything?  Did you say anything?  Was it because of the kids, so you couldn't say anything?  What happened?  You must have noticed, right?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  You know, the poundage went on for the first pregnancy.  I said, you know, it's baby fat.  She's going to lose it later on.  And then the hair went short.  Oh, boy.  And you knew it was over. 
[01:21:00]  She gave up.  Yeah.  And I mean, the second, you know, I love the kids, die for them.  The second one comes around, comes and goes.  And what happened?  Wow.  Wow.  It was just, I don't know, maybe just a food fest or depression or whatever.  I've noticed it takes a lot for a woman to snap back after a kid.  It takes a lot of, like, real work.  And some of them just can't do it.  Some of them don't want to.  And some of them don't want to.  They're like, I got what I wanted. 
[01:21:30]  They don't want to.  They're done.  They don't want to get back in the shape.  They've got what they want.  They've got their husband.  They've got their kids.  They don't need to get back in shape.  They've got the house.  You know, they're not interested in any sort of career.  So, you know, Oprah and Phil and all those guys, you know, screw them.  Sit on the couch a little bit longer.  Dan, can I ask you a personal question here?  Yes.  When was the last time you enjoyed having sex with your wife?  Oh, man.  Boy, are you hitting a sore spot.  Oh, no.  Oh, this poor bastard. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Where's the plane flaming now?  It's been a long time since I've rocked in the moonlight.  You just can't get down there anymore and go, man, this is not what it used to be.  Do you mean you guys still have sex or she won't even have it with you?  Or you just don't really care about having it with her?  Say it again.  I lost you.  Do you like having sex with her or she doesn't want to?  No.  I do it out of, you know, necessity. 
[01:22:30]  It's biological reason.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, there's so much fun you can have with, you know, artificial whatevers.  And I'm like, you know, hey, I'm at the juncture in my life right now.  Or it's just like if she was game right now, I'd have to give her a mercy one.  How's that?  Wow.  Dan, I just did some math for you.  You've been married 21 years.  You realize your wife has gained about six pounds a year.  That's all it is.  A little six pounds a year.  It starts creeping up on you. 
[01:23:00]  Six pounds in one year.  That's nothing.  That's nothing.  You don't notice that.  Year after year after year.  Year after year.  And then what did you do?  Dan, what did you do at one point?  You looked over at your wedding picture that was somewhere in the house and gone, where'd  that girl go?  No, no, no, guys.  When I got married, she gave me a calendar.  Okay?  Yeah.  I still have it.  And you still look at it?  The glory days?  Oh, the glory days.  And then if you try to get a divorce, they're not even going to take into consideration that 
[01:23:30]  your wife gained 123 pounds.  No, you'll look like the bad guy.  You'll be the bad guy if that ever came up.  Uh, you know, I haven't even thought about bringing the calendar over to my attorney  yet, you know?  His wife was on a calendar.  This is what I signed up for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is what I got myself into, not this.  Wait a minute, Mr. Attorney.  You've met my wife, Attila the Hun.  You know?  You want to check her out when she was a fine snapper? 
[01:24:00]  You know?  Wait should be a consideration in divorce cases.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Yep.  You think I can use that?  Look, I understand people gain a little weight as they get older.  I get that.  But your wife went from 118 to 241 pounds.  Yep.  That's not what you signed up for.  That's double plus five.  Listen, I bought her a house and she turned into one.  All right, Dan.  Hang in there.  Hey, guys, listen.  I'm going to punch out.  I appreciate all your good advice. 
[01:24:30]  And listen, I've been a fan and I've got all of it.  So I've been with you guys since day one in New York.  Good luck, man.  Thank you, my friend.  Push her in a pool of stingrays.  All right, listen.  I'll catch up to Jimmy Norton later.  You guys rock.  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  There goes Dan.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  When we get back, I think we should take more of these phone calls.  Yeah.  And don't lie.  It's not going to help anyone out today.  No.  What did your wife weigh when you got married?  What does she weigh now?  And the women could get involved in this, too. 
[01:25:00]  Of course they can, you ladies.  But we don't do a radio show for women.  It ain't for broads.  This is a male's point of view.  In our sick minds, every girl should be a stripper.  That's right.  And I like it when you're anorexic, so don't call crying about it.  They make me so sick.  Good.  If you gain more than five pounds when you're pregnant, we don't like you.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:25:30]  Lots of instant feedback coming in right now.  Kenny from Elizabeth.  You guys are right.  I should have signed a contract.  My wife is a fat pig.  I wouldn't say that to her face because I love her.  But it has to stop.  We have sex about once a month.  Oh, no.  We have sex about once a mouth.  I've been married nine years.  I have four kids.  She is 5'1 and 110.  That's what she was.  He wrote this weird.  I have four kids. 
[01:26:00]  He's in shock.  He should have wrote, she was 5'1 and 110 pounds.  All right.  Now she weighs 219 pounds.  At 5'1, she's 219.  You should actually be legally allowed to kill her.  Yeah, I think you are.  Oh.  219.  What do you do?  It should be a contract.  I'm telling you.  And you re-up.  Because he probably does still love her and stuff.  Yeah.  You know, he's got to go home and just, oh, God, what happened? 
[01:26:30]  Not as much as she loves food.  Exactly.  Here's what you should do.  You put a pie by the steps and you tie a little string by the bottom.  And when Fatso runs for it, she trips and she dies with her face.  Like, as she's going for the pie, she just falls down the stairs and her face passes it as she's falling.  So she sees what she loves right before her neck breaks.  Tries to take a couple of bites out of it.  Misses.  Breaks her neck.  She doesn't even try to prop herself up. 
[01:27:00]  Her teeth just go.  Snap, snap, chatter, chatter.  She's falling.  She goes to the left.  Trying to get one last bite in before she drops dead.  That looks delicious.  She gets a whiff of that pie tin.  Hey, let's go to Earl in Connecticut.  Earl.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  Hey, my wife, I got the opposite problem.  My wife actually went from heavy to being incredibly fit.  What do you mean?  What happened?  Well, when we met, she was a little on the heavy side. 
[01:27:30]  I've been with her for 13 years.  And at one point, she was up to almost 300 pounds.  That's a little on the heavy side?  Yeah, exactly.  That is a fat, fat woman.  You married a dock worker.  She wasn't that when we met.  She's Lee J. Cobbs.  Over the years, she got heavy.  And then she got in this health kick and got down to a size 8.  And I think she went from a 28 to an 8 and actually got muscles.  So how much does she weigh now?  Well, she's actually put a little back on. 
[01:28:00]  I think she's around 200.  So she has about 80 pounds to go.  She's on her way.  Next time, she'll go even thinner.  I've got to say, guys, I love the big girls.  You guys pick on them.  Chubby Chaser.  I totally love them.  Do you really?  Why?  Are you a skinny guy?  I'm a little husky.  But even when I was younger, and I'm probably about 215 now, but even when I was younger,  I don't know what it is.  I just love curvaceous, voluptuous women.  Yeah, exactly.  I like that, too.  But I don't like fat girls. 
[01:28:30]  Now, people that like fat girls, are you afraid of being left by a woman?  Well, see, I kind of had to deal with that, because after she lost weight, a lot of other  guys were interested in her that were technically previously out of her league, so to speak.  And she actually left me about six months ago, got her own apartment.  Oh, boy.  She came back.  She came back.  That's terrific.  Why did she leave you?  Why did she leave you?  Well, 13 years, you know, it wasn't overweight.  Did you lock the cupboard?  It's just, we've been together a long time, and I'm pretty much the only guy she's been. 
[01:29:00]  I wanted her to go out and actually be with somebody else, just to see if the grass was  greener.  Did you?  Did you really?  Yeah.  Is that what you're telling yourself so you don't feel emasculated?  I wanted her to go out and have sex with a few black guys, just to let her know what  she had home.  A cuckold.  She had a cuckold.  I got to let the big white women out there know that they don't have to settle for a black  guy.  There's plenty of white guys who have to love them.  Don't have to settle.  Sir, I don't, I don't, wait, why would you, she left and came back.  Why would you take her back? 
[01:29:30]  She came crawling back.  She listened to the show.  What guy, what guy wants his woman to leave him to see if it's greener?  Because she's never been with another guy and I kind of wanted to see him.  Are you nuts?  If you love something, let it go.  Exactly.  If it comes back, shut up.  That's stupid saying.  If you love something, let it go.  She must have loved cake.  She let it go and it came back and aimed for her mouth.  How does that dump home end?  If you love something, let it go. 
[01:30:00]  If it comes back.  If it comes back.  It was meant to be.  It was yours.  If it doesn't come back.  It was something.  It never was.  It was something about two sets of footprints.  No, that's why did you leave me in my most.  And then she leaves you so now there's one foot of footprints and you can't carry her because  she's a fat pig.  There's a big set of footprints with water in it that jiggles when she walks in the cup  in the SUV.  Right.  If you love something, let it go.  If it comes back, it was yours. 
[01:30:30]  If it doesn't, it would have been yours.  But then?  But then the...  Two donuts and a hand equals what?  Something about a bush.  Right.  You guys are horrible, you know.  Sir, my concern is...  We just don't like the fatties.  What can I tell you?  I love them.  We understand there's guys out there that love the fatties.  That's got to be the number one fetish.  It's got to be the number one fetish is guys that dig fatties.  I want to get to the number one fetish is the foot fetish.  Stop it already.  I don't think so.  Stop it already.  I don't think so. 
[01:31:00]  I think it's chubby chasers.  There's fat women out there.  We're an obese nation and fat women are getting action.  Who's doing it?  Sir, why do you like fat women?  I don't get it.  I can't even tell you.  It's just at the core of, I guess.  Who was your mother like?  My mother was a health nut.  It makes no sense.  We can't figure it out.  My brother's a jock and can get pretty much any girl he wants.  And his past two girls have been on the big side.  Maybe you guys hate your mother, so you're getting the opposite of her.  Maybe she was an emasculating, rotten health nut. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, it doesn't necessarily have to be a physical thing with the mother.  It could be like a mental thing where you needed a little more attention and this big, motherly type woman.  Hey, at the Thanksgiving Day table, does everyone kind of awkwardly look down as your wife keeps going back for thirds and fourths?  She's got a butt for five.  There's always one of those at the table where you look over and go,  Oh, haven't you had enough, you slob?  It's just make-believe.  Yeah, I can't figure out why you're fat. 
[01:32:00]  This is delicious.  I'm just going to have another little slice.  Yeah, I'm sure you are.  Let me just have one more of these, and it's a turkey.  So she went out.  What did you do while she was out with her face in a pillow?  It wasn't in the pillow.  I was over there.  I ended up being over there every other day.  But I was trying to go meet women, too.  And I just, believe it or not, surprise, surprise, my confidence level was pretty low after my wife left me.  Okay.  So I had some conversations.  But we ended up just getting back together and realizing I guess it was meant to be. 
[01:32:30]  So you struck out horribly.  She went out and gobbled on a few.  Now all is well.  I love her.  What can I say?  How many people did she sleep with?  None.  I think she tried to sleep with a couple.  Tried to?  Yeah, sure she did.  But what happened?  All right.  It's part of the injustice of the whole breaking up thing or the girl leaving or something like that.  Because, you know, that night she could be out getting a guy and getting some action.  And for the most part, a guy can't just run out unless he's paying and, you know, seduce a woman into sleeping with him. 
[01:33:00]  All right.  Cody's going to explain the love for fat girls, I guess.  Cody, what's up?  Hey, morning, buddy.  It's Indiana, by the way.  Yeah, thank God, right?  Anyway, you know, the proximity to fat women could usually be, A, I'm a big guy myself.  So I kind of know that my options are limited.  So there's that aspect of it.  The other part is that a lot of them are big-breasted. 
[01:33:30]  And if you have a breast fetish, that kind of always ties in with most fat girls.  Fat girls' big breasts are not good.  Well, not necessarily fat girls.  You know, how I...  No, it's sometimes good.  One of the funniest things to see as I walk the streets in New York are the fatties with no boobs.  Ah, yeah.  We call them flat-sos.  Flat-so.  A flat-so.  Nothing sadder than the flat-so.  Because a lot of women out there that gain weight, they're like, well, at least I got these huge jugs that are attractive to the male species. 
[01:34:00]  They got these little, little A's or B's on this gigantic moose frame.  Yeah, that's so terrible.  We openly laugh at flat-so.  You know, the thicker women, the voluscious pinup types with their actual nice, big bosoms.  Yeah.  So, yeah, that's what I like.  But I'm punching out, fellas.  Have a good day.  All right.  Rosie O'Donnell is a flat-so.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's go to Sharon.  Female point of view here. 
[01:34:30]  Sharon.  Sharon in Connecticut.  Hi, Sharon.  How are you guys?  Oh, my God.  Wow.  We pegged her voice.  How you doing?  I think every guy needs to have their wife listen to O&A.  That way, they will keep their hair long and keep the weight off so their husbands don't call.  I agree.  So we don't care.  That's our goal, to not get any calls about this.  Here's what I want.  I want to, if I ever have kids, I want to be married to the type of girl, like, I'll come  home one day and the kid's head will be mushed from laying in the crib on one side for too 
[01:35:00]  long, and I'll go, what happened?  And she'll go, oh, I was in the mirror fixing my makeup.  Teehee!  I want to do a contest.  I want to find a couple out there that is willing to do this.  Yeah?  You get a wife that's way overweight, and you give her a month to lose, like, 100 pounds.  100 pounds in a month?  That's like kidney failure.  All right.  How about a month to lose 50 pounds? 
[01:35:30]  Can you do that?  All right.  We haven't brought this idea to the lab yet, the Opie and Anthony lab.  The lab.  The institute.  The institute.  All right.  So my numbers might be a little off.  Right.  So how about 50 pounds in a month?  That's a pound.  That's a pound and a half a day, something like that.  And if the woman does not lose the 50 pounds in a month, the guy gets to bang a stripper  in front of her.  Would that be the greatest contest ever?  Would that be the greatest contest ever? 
[01:36:00]  Who would be?  Hey, that is a good one, man.  Then again, does it have to be in front of her?  Because it would wreck the vibe for him to have that big fat face staring in.  It might actually do good, though.  That, like, the guy might enjoy that more.  Like, hey, see what you did?  You know?  That's the bit.  God, that's a good idea.  Screw Celebrity Fit Club.  That is.  We get a few couples.  There's some consequences with this one.  That's right.  All right.  I like that. 
[01:36:30]  Hey, we got money to throw around, right?  Yeah, we do.  We own some people on the papers.  Yeah.  I'd like a story like that.  Dirty cop?  Fat wife?  Hey, by the way, if there's any fat women out there that want to call in and defend yourselves,  I mean, having a kid is probably hard and stuff.  So, I mean, we'll let you talk.  We're not going to jump on you.  No, absolutely not.  I won't jump on you.  I won't even look at you.  But, you know, I mean, I know it's like this is always one point of view.  So, if any women out there want to call in, we promise not to do a lot of weight jokes.  We usually, I mean, I could predict some of the calls we're going to get. 
[01:37:00]  But the women that call up and say, well, what about the guys that go to hell?  Right.  Absolutely.  After marriage.  And then, of course.  Let's go to Steve in Arkansas.  Steve.  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey, man.  Hey, I got that typical story, man.  When I married my woman 21 years ago, she was 5'1", pretty much weighed right at 100 pounds,  perfect cantaloupe breast, just a petite little thing.  Here it is 21 years later, and she weighs 214 pounds.  She's got a Mo Howard haircut, not just short hair.  Mo Howard haircut. 
[01:37:30]  She's got the back, you know how they kind of, Mo's hair was kind of shaved from the back  of his head, half of the back of his head down?  Yeah.  Oh, she thinks that's hot.  And all she talks about is food.  We'll be at a restaurant eating dinner, and she'll talk about what she's going to fix at home.  We're going to be sitting around eating breakfast, and she talks about what we're going to have  for, or she's going to have for lunch.  Oh, boy.  The only thing she reads is magazines with pictures of, well, I call it reading.  She looks at magazines all day long with pictures of food. 
[01:38:00]  She's obsessed, man.  The only time she watches TV, if I'm watching TV and she walks by and it's a Burger King commercial  or something, she's just transfixed.  That's like porno for her.  Like the way normally a guy would look at porno, she's looking at food as if it's pornography.  It's Pavlovian.  She's fucking slobbering.  Oh, God.  I mean, the sad part of it is that somebody was, and I have been asked by old buddies  and stuff, why are you still fucking with her? 
[01:38:30]  I used to say it's because of my kids, but now they're out of the house.  The sad part of it is that I actually kind of still like the fucking beach ball.  I got to agree with it.  You got to stop cursing.  You got to stop cursing.  It's hilarious, but you got to stop cursing, man.  I'm sorry, boys, but I had to agree with it.  That one guy who called in and goes, oh, I know why guys like heavier chicks because they  have big breasts.  Yeah.  She's got the big breasts, but it looks like an old man's butt, you know?  Oh.  She's so heavy, man. 
[01:39:00]  Well, I don't know if you can use this word.  This really isn't what you're talking about.  Probably not.  The end of the breast, that's where it's inverted like an innie belly button.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  Lay on, boys.  Call back again.  You're all right.  What a disaster.  Charlie from Jersey.  We're on to something here.  Charlie.  Hey, how you doing?  I hope you're in Anthony.  Pretty good.  Great show.  Hey, like your previous caller, I really can't stand fat women, especially when they get in  their mid-50s.  They get that haircut that he's talking about. 
[01:39:30]  You can't tell whether they're a guy or a girl.  Yeah.  They got pillows stuffed in the back of their pants for their ass.  That's especially awful.  You're right.  Especially.  And when they defend themselves, they say, oh, I've been battling this horrible disease  all my life like it's something noble.  It's just that they have to push away from the plate.  They keep feeding the wrong hole, which gets them set in the wrong direction from the word  go.  And they eat dainty little portions in front of you. 
[01:40:00]  But when you, I see them driving to work in the truck and they are just pushing the donuts  and the french fries down their throat until they get home and have that small portion.  Yeah.  A lot of them will do that.  They'll still eat like real small portions or salad or something like that.  And then alone, it's just nothing but purge.  It takes a lot of discipline to eat, right?  Binge and no purge.  I try to eat right.  It's a pain in the ass.  It really is a pain in the ass. 
[01:40:30]  I eat oatmeal with blueberries every morning.  And I'm not saying I never eat bad.  But do you think I want to eat this?  I would much rather have a nice bowl of stupid cereal.  I would love to.  Even cereals.  A lot of the cereals aren't bad.  I would love to have donuts every morning.  I mean, honey nut.  Something honey-ish.  Entenmann's chocolate donut.  How about famous Amos cookies are great.  And Oreos.  I would be shoving these down my mouth every morning.  I'm not fat, you know.  I don't know you're not.  I'm not fat, but I try to eat right. 
[01:41:00]  It's a pain in the neck.  I would love to just sit around and tell the interns to go to Krispy Kreme.  Yeah.  You kidding me?  Grab a dozen donuts.  Just going to sit here and eat donuts.  We're miserable to begin with because of our stupid hours.  It would be so easy to sit here and just feed our faces.  It's called discipline.  It's a pain in the neck.  The most successful radio guys are not fat, I noticed.  Really?  Yeah.  I'm telling you.  Well, mine-  Rush Limbaugh?  Yeah, I don't count really him, though, because I'm talking about that genre of political talk.  He lost weight, too. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  He's a rare case.  Most of them are not fat.  My dad's heart problems started in, like, the 93.  He had open heart surgery.  And that's when I changed my ways.  I'm like, I don't, you know, it's in my family history.  I got to stop.  I used to go to the fast food restaurants and all that.  I used to eat whatever I wanted, dessert every night, all that crap, fried food.  Yes.  When you see your dad in a hospital bed after, you know, open heart surgery, you're like, you know what?  Maybe that's motivation.  Maybe I'll go to McDonald's every once in a while now instead of, like, you know, once, twice a week. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  You know what I have for dessert?  I have berries.  Berries.  You're like a little koala bear.  I certainly am.  And I'm as cute as one, ladies.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show, Sirius XM.  We got the Mondo Topless clips.  Yes, Mondo Topless.  Finally.  From the 70s.  Russ Myers, man.  Yeah.  This guy was the guy in the 70s for putting out porno.  And it wasn't like the real hardcore porn. 
[01:42:30]  It was kind of like it was trying to be.  There was porn.  Well.  60s or 70s?  There was porn in the 60s and 70s.  This was early 70s.  Maybe late 60s.  Yeah, but porn was, you know, like bootlegging.  Yeah, it was, you know, 8mm film.  That you kind of like, you had to meet some dude on the corner in the middle of the night.  Right.  And he would hand you a brown paper package.  This was actual, you know, commercialized.  Stuff you saw in theaters that played exclusively, you know, dirty movies. 
[01:43:00]  You know, the X-rated movies.  And they had like little stories or they weren't hardcore.  Not like now where it's, you know, you're going to be seeing some heavy duty work going on.  These are PG-13 now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like nothing.  Just bosoms.  It really is like PG-13.  Yeah, exactly.  Fan just did it.  It's like when a woman pushes her chest out and shakes it back and forth.  Yeah.  You go, ooh.  So I found this Mondo Topless film years ago. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah.  And we used that palaver drop in the intro.  Yeah, that's Russ Meyer.  Actually, our new intro, we're not using it.  And it comes from Mondo Topless.  I heard it today.  This Russ Meyer.  Do we have it in the new one?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I think it's become a staple, if I mind.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry, Steve.  There was, yeah, whatever.  So we got more clips from Mondo Topless today.  And it kind of makes sense to play these today because we're now being heard on Free FM in San Francisco.  Yep.  And this, he filmed his movies, a lot of them in San Francisco. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  And I guess, you know, back then, that's where you got your free-spirited women who were willing to do this.  And they got Topless, and it's Russ Meyer narrating.  Yeah, the whole movie is just girls, Topless, dancing to rock and roll music.  Yeah, bad old rock music, groovy music.  Fake rock and roll music.  Yeah.  Because they couldn't use the real rock and roll music.  He got huge with Super Vixens in the 70s. 
[01:44:30]  That was like his movie.  And then when cable TV really was in its infancy, and they would show, like, the same movie over and over again at night.  Well, they needed to saw porn.  Yeah.  Late at night, like, one in the morning, they would show things like Cheerleaders and Super Vixens, Last Tango in Paris.  Like, anything that had some type of porn in it.  They had really bad dubs, like, when the line had to be redone, like, where, like, they didn't get sound from the room.  Oh, yeah.  They were talking about something, and then you'd hear the voice. 
[01:45:00]  Like, that obviously didn't come from that mouth.  That person?  Yeah.  It didn't matter, though.  But you'd sit there and, you know, flip over the big Cinemax switch or the cable switch and turn a key.  It was like the big involved thing you had to do.  Was that after Wemeko?  Wemeko Home Theater, WHT, the movie network.  I was Cinema 100 out on Long Island, and you did.  You had this box with a switch on it and a key, and you have to turn the key, flip the switch, and there you are looking at smut.  I got to tell you, I am so distracted because E-Rock is playing the Vixen trailer. 
[01:45:30]  You can find it on YouTube.  Oh, yeah.  It is so erotic.  Erotic.  It really is nuts.  Oh, my God.  Oh, there it is.  Okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah, there.  So, anyway, go ahead, Anthony.  I'm sorry.  No, no, no.  Russ Meyer's Vixen.  Vixen.  And then there was Super Vixens and Super Vixens 2.  He kind of put out a whole series.  Yeah.  But it was all just about very well-endowed women just having sex scenes. 
[01:46:00]  It was great.  Right.  He got me through the early years.  All right.  So, why don't we play some clips from Mondo Topless?  They're all short clips.  Well, Mondo Topless begins with girls just driving around Topless.  In San Francisco.  Yeah.  And they show some of the monuments of San Francisco.  And then I think it's Russ Meyer's actually doing the voiceover.  He talks about these structures like they're some kind of sex object.  Everything he talks about has a little sexual twist to it. 
[01:46:30]  And I can't get enough of the guy's voice.  I think it's hilarious.  He's so excited.  You got it.  This guy is so into his work.  And that trailer is really sexy.  I'm telling you.  Women are sexy.  They are like voluptuous.  They have large breasts.  They have really, really hips.  Really sexy.  They're very 60s and early 70s looking women.  They got those bodies that were in fashion.  Buffon hairdos.  Yeah.  Before the anorexia and bulimic look.  Which also could be nice. 
[01:47:00]  It becomes so much the rage.  You know they're not wearing business suits.  Like a girl you can pick your teeth with when you're done.  The type of girl that, you know, she wastes a meal right after you shove it down her throat.  I like it.  I hate myself.  That a girl.  Wear a short skirt when you're vomiting out the car window.  I can have a little peeksy.  Just think of it as a celery stalk.  And it could throw up later.  You know, screw our radio show today.  There you go.  I repeated that because I stumbled.  Go to YouTube and just get the Russ Meyer's trailers. 
[01:47:30]  Because now I'm watching Beyond the Valley of the Dolls trailer.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It was Beyond the Valley of the Super Vixens was another one.  They just got through Super Vixens.  Just throw Russ Meyer's into the search engine of YouTube and you'll have fun this morning.  All right.  Here's Mondo Topless.  So here's Russ Meyer beginning of the film talking about the cable cars of San Francisco.  San Francisco.  San Francisco's bulging peaks and deep canyons lend themselves admirably to its own form of rapid transit. 
[01:48:00]  The surging, swaying cable cars, death-defying and rampaging up and down Hill and Dale, digesting and disgorging humanity at will.  I love the piano, and that's my favorite part of that.  Yeah.  It's like an old silent movie piano playing in front of the screen.  He's talking about sex.  He's talking about girls that are well-endowed.  Pulsating over Hill and Dale.  This has nothing to do with the cable cars of San Francisco.  He says, trying to make cable cars sexy. 
[01:48:30]  And he did.  And the hot rice-a-roni picture ad on the back.  Listen to what he has to say about Coit Tower.  San Francisco is a city of religious respect and authority.  And democratically, there are those who are in disagreement.  San Francisco's art colony is dominated by the arrogant and imposing Coit Tower, thrusting its bulk majestically to the sky, with the Broadway tunnel offering a yawning orifice through which to enter fabled North Beach. 
[01:49:00]  A yawning orifice.  Is he talking about tunnels and towers?  I think he's talking about some chick that's passed out cold.  One of his vixens.  And then he finally starts getting into the art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  Is there art to topless?  Yeah.  The way he puts it?  No.  The art of the topless.  That just didn't catch on, unfortunately.  All natural girls, too. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  You won't find any implants in any of his movies.  They're all natural.  Fantastic.  Natural.  Like the big teardrops.  Not a bee among them.  Very big.  And they run.  Yeah.  They play in the mud.  They play in the mud in the dirt.  They're not afraid to get, like, their feet dirty.  They giggle.  Chuckle, chuckle, chuckle.  And they shake in a lovely fashion.  Love it.  All right.  Here's...  Dirty horse.  The topless.  Dirty horse.  San Francisco.  A Spamone-like hodgepodge of wild architecture harboring wonderful old world restaurants and emporiums of pleasure. 
[01:50:00]  Exploding from dust to dawn with the way-out craze of the topless.  Formed and nurtured by staid and stolid San Francisco.  And cut loose to rampage across the USA and even Europe.  National publications such as Life, Playboy, and Esquire have documented the topless.  The phrase and the craze that is changing the mood and the mores of people everywhere. 
[01:50:30]  The mood and the mores.  And the mores.  What was the opening line to that was really great?  The something-something hodgepodge.  Yeah.  A Spamone hodgepodge.  It's the first line.  It's like it's the hodgepodge.  San Francisco.  A Spamone-like hodgepodge of wild architecture harboring wonderful old world restaurants and emporiums.  Spamone-like hodgepodge.  Here was this like 1800s emporiums. 
[01:51:00]  What does Spamone mean?  Spamone, I know, is some kind of Italian-like ice cream thing.  That's all I know.  He's got a lot of words in there I've never heard in my life.  Doesn't it?  I don't like it.  We've got to imitate this.  I'm a bad guinea.  We've got to imitate this voice and do promos for our show with these way-out words.  A mix of different flavors.  We have to get different people because ours, you know, Spamone-like hodgepodge.  That's not the way to do it. 
[01:51:30]  Steve should take a lesson from Russ Meyer.  O-N-A!  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  The show on the road.  Enough of this palaver.  That's palaver.  I'm sorry.  Here he describes the Mondo Topless movement.  Mondo Topless captures the basic quintessence of the movement.  With movement.  Way out.  Wild movement.  Here, go-go girls, in and out of their environment, will be revealed to you in scenes that can only 
[01:52:00]  be summarized as a swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Mondo Topless is believably real in Eastman color.  But unbelievable just barely describes all of Russ Meyer's discotheque discoveries.  Fantastic women.  Fantastic dances.  Featuring the world's loveliest bucks attics.  You've only dreamed there were women like these until now. 
[01:52:30]  But they're real.  Unbelievably real in Mondo Topless.  He is worked up, man.  He is psyched about his movie.  He's frothing.  He loves his job.  Mondo Topless.  Is it him doing the announcing, we think?  Yeah, it is.  It has to be.  Yeah, somebody checked on IMDb.  E-Rock is killing me.  I'm just watching Russ Meyer trailers from YouTube.  Aren't they great?  Bucksotics.  Oh, my God.  Bucksotics.  What the hell is that?  I don't know, but it's all I want to say from now on. 
[01:53:00]  That girl is quite bucksotic.  Well, they're bucksotics, the two of them.  I mean, they're busty.  Well, this is where it gets really good.  He starts introducing the girls.  I think on the walkover today, I'm just going to talk to all the people on the street like Russ Meyer.  Yeah, let's do that.  How are you today, you bucksotic?  Welcome to this palindrome of pleasure.  Enough of this palaver.  Where are you going?  That's right.  Whore.  Enough of this palaver.  Why don't you walk on the road?  Did you take...  No.  I couldn't think of anything we'd say outside, so I bought it. 
[01:53:30]  Did you take the bridge or one of the slippery, lubricated tunnels until Manhattan?  Until Manhattan?  Until...  There's nothing worse than when you trip and sustain an injury, and while your friend is laughing at you, he also hurts himself.  I fell and injured myself over my own words.  All right, here we go.  The introduction of the ladies.  Beast your eyes on bumptious Pat Barringer, oxonic Darlene Gray, luscious Cinlenae, delicious Darla Paris, yummy Diane Young, exciting Donna X, and bouncy Babbitt Bardot. 
[01:54:00]  Yes, for the very first time, you will hear actual on-the-spot recorded tapes consisting of sensitive comments and opinions by the very topless dancers wildly gyrating before your eyes.  Pearls of wisdom based upon guarded personal experiences all played against a backdrop of compestuous, soul-stirring rock and roll music. 
[01:54:30]  Classic.  Can I think my favorite part of that whole thing is that there's a stripper named Pat Barrington.  Pat Barrington.  That's the worst name for a stripper ever.  I'm Pat Barrington.  I got to help you.  Pat Barrington.  Pat Barrington.  By the way, all these clips are from the first ten minutes of the film. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, and it's just pictures of San Francisco and topless women chasing each other around, dancing, shaking.  With just beautiful, perfect cones.  Yeah, like untouched by silicone or anything like that.  Natural girls.  Is he in the rest of the movie, too?  He's never in the movie.  No, not me, but the narration.  His narration.  Oh, yeah, through the whole thing.  Yeah, it goes out through the whole thing.  And look at this one.  The movie goes on for, I don't know, I've never gotten to the end of the film.  No.  You rarely do.  As soon as you got to go for a towel, it's time to hit stop. 
[01:55:30]  That's it.  You don't hit pause, you hit stop.  Hit stop.  Hit stop on the tape and on on the shame.  As clean-up time begins.  A friend of mine, I was talking one time about when you know it's time to put that part of your addiction away.  He goes, you know, one time I was in my parents' house, and I was 30, and I was shuffling with my pants around my ankles to the bathroom, and I'm like, what am I doing?  All right.  Yeah, you sometimes give a thought like, ah, come on, enough's enough. 
[01:56:00]  Because the high is over, that moment of clarity is there.  You can only touch the doorknob with one hand, and you're like, what am I doing with my life?  This is cute when you're 18.  Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  Damn, that's funny.  Here's where we got the palaver drop.  But enough of this palaver.  Palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Rebbing up on runway number one is punctuous Pat Baringer, a magnificently configured female skilled in the art of the topless. 
[01:56:30]  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say.  She's so skilled in the art of the topless that it's just wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, coming out of her mouth.  Even Russ knows it.  She's a blathering idiot.  Russ knows what guys want.  Oh, that Pat Barrington, you just can't concentrate on her words.  Pat Barrington.  It's the greatest stripper name ever.  This guy just loses his mind.  How many Pat Barringtons are going to turn up on the message boards now? 
[01:57:00]  Exactly.  Oh, boy.  It's only a man's name, but it's a bland man's name.  Yeah, it's awful.  Hi, Pat Barrington, here to close that big deal.  Are you?  Dan, you're going to have to get more drops.  You're going to have to.  We love Russ Meyer.  We have, like, five more drops.  They're all really quick.  It's him just introing each girl.  Each girl.  So that was Pat Barrington or whatever.  Barrington.  Barrington.  Barrington.  Well, here he introduces Darlene.  Ah.  Ready to entertain you as Buxotic Darlene Gray. 
[01:57:30]  England's answer to the biggest and the best.  What do you say, Darlene?  He, like, turns around and asks her, what do you say, stupid whore?  And, of course, these girls just have nothing to say.  Bill from Waterford.  How is someone skilled in the art of the topless?  I know.  That's what we've been saying.  The beauty of him.  He's just great how he uses his words.  The art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  He's a stripper.  The art of being topless? 
[01:58:00]  No.  The art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  I've studied the topless for many years.  I'm quite skilled in the art of the topless.  All right.  Here's the intro for Sin.  And away we go with Lutches and Lene.  Svelte and lithesome.  Give us a word, Sin.  Sin.  Lithesome.  Give us a word.  He's just in heaven.  Yeah.  He's just in heaven. 
[01:58:30]  Guy was a filthy man making a living.  Here's Darla.  Try to follow delicious Darla Paris vivaciously voluptuous.  Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.  His old World War II lingo.  That's right.  Kilroy was here and here on these voluptuous ones.  Now we show you a woman who looks like she's got two Kaiser helmets on her chest. 
[01:59:00]  And all the ships at sea.  He's great.  And under her shirt are two Jews who start all the wars in the world.  I'm going to finish up here with Russ Meyer.  Here he is introing Diane.  Settle back and let yummy Diane Young entertain you.  Blondely beautiful. 
[01:59:30]  And while you're about it, lend her your ear.  Yeah.  I want to hear what some of these girls have to say.  Because I'm sure it's a worthless babble.  Well, that could be the next thing we do.  Yeah.  Because they talk about their toplessness.  Yeah.  The art of the toplessness.  That's not a bad idea.  Relax and enjoy exciting Donna X.  Juno-esque of proportion.  Listen closely to what she has to say about topless.  About topless. 
[02:00:00]  Juno-esque.  He's losing it.  Juno-esque.  He's running out of adjectives.  Is he?  And finally, this is the last one for today.  Hang on, men.  And zero in on bouncy Babbitt Bardot.  Babbitt.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts.  Speak to us, Babbitt baby.  Hey, finish his strong.  Best one.  50-50 where it counts.  French and Swedish.  Yeah. 
[02:00:30]  That's good because the French are known for, you know, their mouths.  Right, right.  And I guess the Swedes are known for anything below the waist.  But they should have thrown a little Greek in her, I think.  Hey, let's hear that again.  33 and a third where it counts.  Let's hear this one again.  Hang on, men, and zero in on bouncy Babbitt Bardot.  No, French and Swedish. 
[02:01:00]  50-50 where it counts.  Speak to us, Babbitt baby.  Babbitt baby.  Love that guy.  Oh, he's a really good egg.  We've just touched the surface.  That's the first 10, 15 minutes of the film, basically.  It goes on.  I've never seen the end of the film, so maybe we can see what...  Maybe we can all watch it together later.  What all the hubbubs about.  It's the worst of the O.P. Anthony show.  Here we go.  Here's some more audio.  Well, we played these two clips yesterday just to get everyone up to speed.  And then finally, we'll have the girls speak, okay? 
[02:01:30]  The Art of the Topless from Mondo Topless.  San Francisco.  A Spamoni-like hodgepodge of wild architecture,  harboring wonderful old-world restaurants and emporiums of pleasure.  Exploding from dust to dawn with the way-out craze of the Topless.  Born and nurtured by staid and stolid San Francisco.  And cut loose to rampage across the USA and even Europe.  National publications such as Life, Playboy, and Esquire have documented the Topless. 
[02:02:00]  The phrase and the craze that is changing the mood and the mores of people everywhere.  Why didn't that catch on?  The Art of the Topless.  The way-out craze of the Topless.  Of the Topless.  The Topless.  That is just a fantastic thing.  The Topless.  Has someone taken that name on the fan sites?  They had to.  They had to, right?  I haven't checked.  I'm sure if the coveted The Topless. 
[02:02:30]  The Topless.  The Art of the Topless.  Here's another clip from yesterday.  Mondo Topless captures the basic quintessence of the movement.  With movement.  Way out wild movement.  Here, go-go girls, in and out of their environment,  will be revealed to you in scenes that can only be summarized  as a swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Mondo Topless is believably real.  In Eastman color.  But unbelievable just barely describes all of Russ Meyer's discotheque discoveries. 
[02:03:00]  Fantastic women.  Fantastic dances.  Featuring the world's loveliest boxatics.  You've only dreamed there were women like these until now.  But they're real.  Unbelievably real.  In Mondo Topless.  That's a guy's voice that would, like,  if nuclear missiles were headed your way,  that's how his delivery should be. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, my God, people.  Nuclear missiles headed towards our cities.  But he's talking about The Topless.  The Topless.  The Art of The Topless.  I like that.  Brings it all back together.  Yeah.  Holla.  Holla.  What did he say?  Something about girl?  You got girl?  That's right, girl.  That's right, girl.  You go, girl?  No, it wasn't quite that bad.  No.  He's headed in that direction. 
[02:04:00]  He certainly is.  Before we hear from the girls, from Mondo Topless,  one more clip.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Revving up on runway number one is punctuous Pat Barringer,  a magnificently configured female skilled in the art of the Topless.  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say.  She's so good in the art of the Topless and so buxotic that he defies you 
[02:04:30]  to even listen to a word coming out of her stupid mouth.  He begs you to try to register one word this dumb bitch is saying  while they're swinging in front of your face.  Of course.  As she just is in the art of the Topless, in the moment.  Wonderful.  Oh, Pat Barringer.  What a great stripper name.  Pat Barringer.  All right.  Oh, that's an awful name.  Come on, guys. 
[02:05:00]  Put it together.  Here's Pat Barringer.  That's the girl at the office.  The new girl.  The new temp.  This is Pat Barringer.  She's going to be sitting in for a while.  That's the name of a tight end in like 1965.  Taking the field, Pat Barringer.  John Madden, Pat Barringer.  In the booth, I'm here with Pat Barringer.  Right.  No, you were skilled in the art of the topless.  That's right, Pat.  Damn it.  Let's. 
[02:05:30]  Suck.  Let's listen to Pat Barringer.  Make me feel better.  No, it's all right.  I think I might have to play that palaver clip again.  I think it's part of the Pat Barringer dialogue.  That's fine.  You can never get enough of it.  Huh?  Yeah, I need something to bring me up.  I screwed up that joke.  No mistake.  Here we go.  I said.  I'll do it.  Reving up on runway number one is punctuous Pat Barringer.  A magnificently configured female skilled in the art of the topless.  I beg you to try to listen to what she has to say. 
[02:06:00]  All that you're doing is a dance.  It has no meaning whatsoever.  There are gyrations and so on, suggestive movements, but still it is entertainment and  there is no other meaning other than a dance.  What'd she say?  She's just.  I couldn't hear a word.  I tried to listen.  I was paying attention to the art of the topless.  I took his advice.  He's right.  I have no idea what she said.  Pat Barringer is an idiot. 
[02:06:30]  Wake up with Pat Barringer.  Thank you, Bill.  From Waterford.  Welcome back to the Pat Barringer and Anthony show.  La, la, la, la, la.  The art of the topless.  I want to smack Pat Barringer, even though she's probably  a grandma in diapers by now.  I'd love nothing more than to not only not listen to her, but to blacken her eye.  Let's listen to the next fine.  The art of my fist.  Let's listen to the next fine female here.  Ready to entertain you as buxotic Darlene Gray. 
[02:07:00]  England's answer to the biggest and the best.  What do you say, Darlene?  No, I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  That was it?  I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  And you know, it's just one of those missile cone, nose cone bras.  I don't wear a brassiere to bed.  Wow, outrageous in the art of the topless.  What was her name?  Diane Gray?  Darlene Gray.  Darlene Gray. 
[02:07:30]  That's all she's got.  That's also an awful name for a stripper.  Darlene Gray.  G-R-E-Y because she's from London.  I think we've given women too much power.  Wow.  This is how it used to be.  That was shocking back then?  Right.  Holy Jesus Palomino.  She doesn't wear a bra to bed.  You're lucky we don't just keep you chained in the basement for procreation, you dopes.  Where else are you going to hear this?  You want to hear from Luscious Sin? 
[02:08:00]  Luscious Sin.  And away we go with Luscious Sin, Lene.  Svelte and lidesome.  Give us a word, Sin.  I can be around anything green and have a feeling of sensation run through my body only because it is a feeling of nature.  It is a feeling of freedom.  She loves the color green.  How about snot?  Yeah.  How do you feel about a booger?  Wow, these are just hippie broads that are so doped up. 
[02:08:30]  I remember her now from Mondo Topless.  She's the one that just did the art of the topless in the middle of the woods.  Just dancing and running around.  She was the nature one.  Yeah.  What you can hope for is a nice evil dead moment with a tree branch.  So that's Luscious Sin.  She loves the color green.  Holy s**t.  These girls have nothing to say.  But they are experts in the art of the topless.  Well, Cigars and Scotch, they're coming in like crazy now.  Are we allowed to say Whack Bag at this point? 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  One of our fine fan sites?  Yes.  He writes, Jim Norton, the art of the chinless.  Oh, God.  Let's hear a word, Jimmy.  I would play football, but the helmet would always fall off because there was nothing to strap it onto.  You guys want to hear from Darla Paris?  Of course.  All right.  Try to follow delicious Darla Paris, vivaciously voluptuous. 
[02:09:30]  Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea.  And the last time I measured, it was 30, 60.  That's outrageous back then.  Yep.  This is what people used to go to theaters for, too.  There was no video tape.  There was no DVD on demand.  None of that to just sit in the comfort of your own home.  You used to have to go to a theater and share it with perverts that were actually getting off to this garbage. 
[02:10:00]  And then spatula your shoes on your way home.  You ready for this?  Buxotic Boston Tom writes from Framingham, wake up with the topless.  The topless.  And then Stephen from Bayshore, he writes some great stuff every morning.  Do you have any clips from Mondo Whoopi?  She knows the art of the jokeless.  An expert in the art of the jokeless. 
[02:10:30]  That was Darla Paris, huh?  We move on with...  Love these names.  We move on with Diane Young.  It's also another one.  Just an awful stripper name.  Diane Young.  How unsexy is that?  Settle back and let yummy Diane Young entertain you.  Blondly beautiful.  And while you're about it, lend her your ear.  I used to play a cello in a symphony orchestra when I was 13. 
[02:11:00]  You gotta be kidding me.  This is one of my favorite movies to just show people when they come over, man.  And it just has that 60s look and it's all groovy and they're topless, talking about, babbling about nothing.  She probably talked for a half hour, 40 minutes, and that's the only clip they could take.  This dope talk.  She played cello when she was 13.  The rest of it was probably just begging for acid or something.  You know, please, please, just, I need acid, please. 
[02:11:30]  She probably tried to make political statements about the war in Vietnam.  And they were just like, all right, shut up, stupid, and say something we can make you look foolish with.  All right.  Want to hear from Donna X?  Yeah, it's a mysterious name.  All right.  Oh, the dance.  Whoa, what happened?  Dan goes, she's literally doing the monkey in the clip.  Yeah.  The dance?  Yeah.  You know, you swing your arms around, do the monkey. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  She was doing that.  It's so not hot.  I used to play the cello.  Did ya?  Dan, you got to bring this home over the weekend and get us Mondo Topless Part 3 for Monday or Tuesday.  Okay.  All right?  Yep.  There's way, there's so much more to get to with this Mondo Topless.  We've just scratched the surface.  Here's Donna X.  Relax and enjoy exciting Donna X.  Juno-esque of proportion. 
[02:12:30]  Listen closely to what she has to say about Topless.  Oh, I think everybody goes by moods.  You might make it every night a steady thing for a month, and then you might lay off for a whole complete week and really not even need it at all.  It depends on your mental attitude.  The Topless she's talking about?  Not being topless?  Not being topless, sir.  The Topless.  I think she goes, you might go with The Topless for a while.  I have no idea what these idiots are babbling about. 
[02:13:00]  The Mental Attitude.  She can't help herself?  She has to do The Topless?  Is that what we're getting at in that clip?  Wow.  I actually want to buy this film now on DVD.  Oh, it's wonderful.  All right, we got six more clips to play after the break.  Thank God.  It's the worst thing for me at the show.  Back to Mondo Topless.  The art of the Topless.  We get to say hi to Babette Bardot.  Babette Bardot. 
[02:13:30]  Hang on, men, and zero in on bouncy Babette Bardot.  French and Swedish.  50-50 where it counts.  Beat to us, Babette baby.  I try to project a childlike to a woman quality because I do believe that men, they're not like so much odd sex.  They like softness also.  So I try to project both sexuality and also gentleness.  So I do always start my act more or less in a very gentle way. 
[02:14:00]  You know, any one of these girls, you'd have to foreplay, you'd need a machete.  Because we all know what the style was back then.  Au natural.  Yeah, there you go.  So that's Babette Bardot.  I hate when they don't shave.  You don't like that?  It stinks.  It's coming back.  Not in my life, it's not.  I see one hair, it's duct tape. 
[02:14:30]  Goodbye.  Absolutely.  Everything old is new again.  Yeah.  It's coming back around.  It's back in style.  It's coming back around.  Eek.  No, the hair is never coming back.  It's got to be well trimmed, but I'm not offended by, you know, any hair.  It was here for 10,000 years.  Leave it for a little while. 
[02:15:00]  How about that?  It was in for 10,000 years to be unshaven chimps.  How about giving us a break, would you?  How about that?  Let's get back to the art of the topless.  We get to say hi to, I don't know who this is, actually.  Let's see what this is about.  I'm sure she's buxom.  It's the type of audience that finds more enjoyment from a dancer than you give them dancing.  If they find more enjoyment from slower movements and more suggestive movements than you give them that. 
[02:15:30]  She's explaining her, the art of the topless.  The art of the topless.  At least they're talking about actually dancing.  How about we do one of these updated now?  Mondo topless for this century.  I don't know.  I'm working to, you know, just go.  I'm trying to get money for school.  I don't know.  I'm just going to stand here and not dance.  I'm going to squat down and talk to guys.  Get up and dance.  Get up and dance.  Show us the art of the topless.  Get to the pole, bitch. 
[02:16:00]  The strippers bug me.  They're horny moves.  Hate them.  He he he he he he.  Shut up.  Just cannot stand that.  They have forgotten the art of the topless, Opie.  Yeah.  I do believe strippers of this day and age.  It's all about give me 20 bucks so I could sit in your lap.  The art of the grabbing your cash.  Yeah.  Big dumb implants.  No sex appeal at all.  Their lap dances are awful.  One more stupid hair over the lap thing.  I'm going to rip it out by the root.  Wouldn't that be great? 
[02:16:30]  Just grab a big handful of bleach blonde hair and pull out two big fists.  Yeah.  You just got blonde hair wavering as a big bouncer punches your face.  But as he's pulling you out, you refuse to let go?  Yeah.  So she's being dragged out?  All right.  Here's the bimbo talking about personality.  Well, I feel that personality has a lot to do with it.  And I think that I have been able to present a personality that is a little different than a lot of girls have. 
[02:17:00]  She's sexy, man.  Is she?  Yeah.  She's a different voice.  Yeah, voice.  Well, this next girl, she says she's full of the devil.  She's full of the devil.  The devil.  And it influences her art of the topless.  The topless is quite different from the exotic field because there I am vivacious and alive and full of the devil.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm sometimes vivacious in my exotic work also.  But there are two different type of moods entirely where in the exotic field, everything is done with slow enticing movements and a teasing type form. 
[02:17:30]  Where in my topless, I am just vivacious and full of warmth and like would like to have some fun.  The topless.  So the art of the topless is different than being a stripper?  It's like whore exhibit A and B.  Right.  Yeah.  I guess they could rationalize going home and sleeping a little easier with the topless than the exotic. 
[02:18:00]  Well, when I'm in the topless, I'm disappointing my parents this way.  And in the exotic, I'm humiliating them publicly that way.  Oh, I see.  I think the exotic dad puts the shotgun in his mouth, but the topless, he just tries not to make eye contact with the neighbors or any friends.  Or he feels guilty for whatever he did that made you do this for a little bit.  Right.  Right.  Exotic, daddy did something to you.  The art of the topless, dad uncle did something to you. 
[02:18:30]  Your uncle did once, but he was from out of town, so he didn't have enough opportunities to ruin you for life.  There you go.  Back to the voiceover guy.  What must a girl possess to measure up as a topless dancer?  She must have a body well above the average in physical beauty, unblemished by an uneven suntan, together with a bust line that is firm and youthful.  The topless dancer's face as well must bear an equal burden with the body. 
[02:19:00]  Burden.  Encouraging sensuous and provocative expression, supplementing her physically exciting figure.  Wow.  Exciting figure.  Guy does know.  Hey, you know this guy that did the voiceover apparently is still alive.  Yeah.  We got to get him on the phone somehow.  Get him.  It's going to be one of those bad interviews though.  Book it.  You mean me?  Yeah.  We had an interview one time with the guy that did cartoon voices for everybody.  Yogi Bear, Ranger Smith, Ricochet Rabbit, like all that genre was all this guy. 
[02:19:30]  And we were very excited to have him on our show when we were in Worcester, Boston.  And he got on and, oh my God, he was senile.  We're asking him, you know, hey, could you just do some Ricochet Rabbit?  What do you mean me?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  What else do you think we're talking about?  You idiot. 
[02:20:00]  Then he passed away very shortly afterwards.  Yeah, it was a very uncomfortable interview.  Fortunately, we didn't get the last interview.  All right.  Here's the last clip for today.  Mondo Topless, voiceover guy, introing another girl, but there's no voice of this girl.  So you'll just hear a really, just another fantastic intro by this guy.  Love him.  Completely topless.  Completely uninhibited.  This way out craze that began in San Francisco has now vaulted across the ocean to Europe. 
[02:20:30]  Every sin sinner has embraced this swinging tribute to unrestrained female anatomy.  Let's jet to Belgium and look in on the famed Moulin Rouge,  where the buxom bombshelled Veronique Gabrielle performs her heady,  hedonistic dance of the leather belt.  An incendiary art calculated to ignite the flames of passion within the male spectators.  Her fabulous figure is the envy of women  and the delight of men. 
[02:21:00]  There is no one better.  Whoever wrote this is brilliant, by the way.  Yeah, that is great writing.  Incendiary.  Incendiary.  Right.  Oh, wow.  From San Francisco to Europe.  Kind of a long way around.  Yeah, didn't it?  Shouldn't it sweep the country first?  Yeah, well, you know what it is?  It probably took a loop around Canada.  Yeah, okay.  Passed right by those boring Canucks.  I'm sure it skipped like Iowa.  Or to the topless, eh?  And there you go.  That's it for today. 
[02:21:30]  Mondo topless.  We'll have more in the coming weeks.  Love him.  Got to get him.  See if he still is alive.  We'd love to have him.  I have to tinkle.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Steven S. from Bayshore.  You guys realize that all those buxodics are now in their 60s.  Yeah.  Ugh.  There's not much bounce left.  The art of the saggage.  It's bouncing off their knees.  Wonderful.  I defy you to a listen to a word she says, as an orderly as changing her diapers. 
[02:22:00]  You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony, Sirius XM.  Jimmy.  Hello?  Jimmy.  Hi, Jim.  Am I on the radio?  Yes.  I'm walking to the restroom.  Hey, is Frank the frowner with you?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Why?  I had to go to the bathroom and I couldn't wait.  Oh, there's the door.  I need, excuse me, son.  Could you get me the key?  There's a young boy in pose office. 
[02:22:30]  He should have.  Do you know it takes more muscles to frown than it's just a smile somebody once whispered  to me?  He's telling everybody that little factoid.  He's running out of air as he does it.  He's such a creep.  Thank you, sir.  This is a terrible.  This is an uncomfortable creep.  Man, hold the bathroom door for me.  Now, let's listen to Jimmy.  This is so disgusting.  I'm not ready yet.  It's going to make me puke.  Clean the seat off.  Oh, he's got to do his little ritual. 
[02:23:00]  Clean the seat off.  You don't clean your chest off, but you'll clean the seat off.  Yeah, no kidding.  There's hairs on it, too.  He's not without his inconsistencies.  There's hairs all over the seat.  Hairs on the seat.  Yeah, little curly ones, too.  I'm not kidding.  You can hear his little belt buckle jingle.  No, I'm just carrying toilet paper off.  Can you take a dump as Frank the Frowner?  But don't do it during the dump.  I know.  Believe me. 
[02:23:30]  I promise.  I won't spoil it.  What does that mean?  Hold on.  Now you'll hear some urine.  Wait a minute.  I'm still getting undressed.  What was that?  If you dropped your phone, I'll be so happy.  Hold on.  Fuck.  Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons.  A new Kiss coffee house is opening up.  Coffee with attitude.  Wonderful.  Hold on one second.

[03:33:30]  ai thing you the artificial  intelligence you can't just  go rush them there's a guy  who the only help it gives  you is a grenade uh uh  implicator that the grenade  is implied around your area  that's the only way that's  it that you'll continue to  live other than that it's  like real world war ii  like you go oh my god  like you start to get  nervous like holy shit  i died  like you would you always  imagine yourself in war like  being one of those guys 
[03:34:00]  oh you're living but it's  like okay i'm crawling and  then a dude is right there  and he shoots you in the  back of the head and it  and it gives you and here's  how creepy it is it wiggles  it says yeah you died and  then it gives you a quote for  some fucking war guy yeah  war is crazy shit alexander  the great  you know i never learned  that quote from that guy  you know it's war is some  crazy shit it's it's not  it's not fun yeah it's war 
[03:34:30]  it's very realistic as far as  uh the enemy ai goes it's  not like the old days you're  right the older games you  could run in run and shoot  run and shoot run and shoot  now it's about you know uh  i gotta do a pincer maneuver  we have to outflank this guy  and yeah the guys are right  there they take cover now  when you shoot at them some  rambo shit the old school was  rambo  this one the only the only two  things that's game like is one 
[03:35:00]  like i said it tells you that a  grenade is in the vicinity a  little grenade and it'll be an  arrow that's pointing towards  where it is yeah so if it's  behind you the arrows pointing  down and you go you run  forward and if you run  forward those motherfuckers  shoot you as you're trying to  run from the grenade so you're  you can picture yourself going  oh grenade and then run and  then you die the only and then  it's time for another quote  another quote 
[03:35:30]  i'm not gonna do this ever in my  life  winston church  you know and the only thing  that's like game like it gives  you barriers  right that you can't go  past  yeah like a broken down  building  a broken building with a crack  you can't squeeze through  something  just to keep you on that  thing  but other than that dude it is  and then the the the illest  thing about the game  okay two two or three of you  you know you got always got two 
[03:36:00]  or three friends  yeah  you're in an abandoned building  and it says okay hold down this  building until such such comes  and usually in those old school  games you just pick them all  blah blah  these motherfuckers dude  you hear  like  hundreds of guys and you see  them running over the hillside  at you  and you're like oh my god you  just go  turn it off  like i said you know what this is  not even fuck this is not even  fun  it's it's this is like real it's 
[03:36:30]  stressing me out  yeah  you know but it's it's  unbelievable it's an unbelievable  game  to exist  yep  but it's not that great of fun  man it's not it's it's it's  really not  they're getting amazing  they're only gonna get better  you've been through a part of  the game where you gotta walk  through  and it's uh  old busted down buildings and  shit  and it's nothing but snipers  that you can't see  they're you're you're walking  you're taking cover and  everything  and all of a sudden  and you're getting hit 
[03:37:00]  you're trying to take cover  you're getting hit from the  back and you look around  you pop up for a quick look  because you're getting shot  you can't see shit  there's snipers everywhere  it's the and and then your  sniper this is the thing  it's just like i don't want to  play a real game like the  basketball and all that shit  it's like i don't need to see  this motherfucking sweat or  or his draws get wet or  whatever and but the on the war  game the sniper mode it's not  just like  now sniper is your favorite gun  yeah in any game is the 
[03:37:30]  sniper gun ready not this  shit that you shake  what you you the shit goes  up and down yeah yeah  so you gotta put this you  gotta push the stop being  nervous button yeah there's a  stop breathing button then you  go  all right  and if you miss the  motherfucker knows you shot  at him  and then runs  i didn't know he's coming to  find you now  and he's coming to get he  they find your where you 
[03:38:00]  where the with a they say  came from there yeah go  tell the the ai go say it  came from that building over  there you gotta move you gotta  move around to the other end  and then when you there's no  pop pop pop no you got okay  remember barry pepper from uh  uh yeah and he just god lord  heaven  okay lord please jesus all  little come on baby you got 
[03:38:30]  and then the tank goes he's  over there  oh shit  rolls his ass right out of the  tower  it's unbelievable man i i it's  like it's unbelievable i can't  even i don't even want to hype up  the game that much but it's like  it really says oh my god i would  have died many times  yeah the old games didn't do  that this one  these ones they're really  starting to immerse you in the  game it gives you true  immersion  there was one i played a while  back  i think it was a call of duty

[03:44:00]  the worse he is the more precise your  motion has to be exact with his hand and  it's like this is not fun like they have  done fun they have done a great job of  figuring out how to interpret your  movements with a mouse and a keyboard or  or a controller on an xbox into games like  basketball and golf things like that where  it makes sense because you think how am i  going to swing a fucking golf club with a  keyboard and a mouse but they figured it 
[03:44:30]  out and really got like where a where  finesse matters and you know little  fuck-ups really magnify on a golf course  you know just like they do when you're  you're swinging a club that's what i  played all week the tiger woods there  yeah tiger was that good what a great  fucking golf game that is well i'm all  about the psp now so i could still watch  tv and just sit there while you really  you stayed into it what you stayed into  it the psp yeah i like the psp because  you could lay on a couch and play and you  could still watch tv and do whatever you 
[03:45:00]  want to do you know graphics are great  on it it's amazing i mean obviously the  graphics are better on the computer and  the tv but it's it's really it's right  there and they're committed they're  committed to that thing because they got  movies out for that yeah that's like the  and i committed a whole section i  committed to the tiger woods game while i  was uh out sick last week and just like  anthony was saying if you don't have the  rhythm of that thing down yeah what a  fucking pain in the ass it's amazing  this shit it's just i love it but i  guess the xbox is only you know it's  just like oh you can see the gleam in  his eye and then it moves exactly like 
[03:45:30]  the nba so you're like okay where's the  speed up no i ain't no speed up you know  there's there's general manager mode  where it's like you make trades and i go  okay you know what i'm gonna put kevin  garnett on cleveland and they go will not  accept trade the salary castle the fuck is  playing this shit salary cap fuck the  i said nigga i want kevin garnett to play  with lebron james we will not it that's

[03:48:00]  that has to interfere with the exercise  of that has to interfere like why play  real like why be real you know these  things are so real it's like why even  why bother well that seems to be a  problem that's perking up  they had some kid over the weekend i  read a story on drudge uh that he had  this chronic head shaking his head would  just fucking shake this little kid like  nine years old or 11 or something like  that  and uh mother took him to the doctor  and  doctor asked what his daily activities 
[03:48:30]  were and apparently eight hours a day  was playing uh video games so he said  have him stop playing the video games  and his head stopped shaking  it was he actually got a physical  fucking ailment from staring at these  games and and playing  wow  head would shake  oh my let's say hi to brian in  north carolina brian what's up  hey man what's going on  hey brian  telling about the uh game fear  i don't know going back to the game  companies yeah they uh they're really  just looking to scare the fuck out of  people 
[03:49:00]  i'm telling you right now the game i  played the demo of it  and uh there's just parts that you  know they they sit there and have  these creepy little fuckers coming  out at you  yeah  i don't know i had to shut the damn  thing up  fear is a scary ass game  the gameplay itself the only bad  thing about it is the levels are  pretty repetitive  you're like if you play one level  you've played them all  pretty much  but scary shit you're walking around  these old creepy and they've gotten  the music into it where you know 
[03:49:30]  you'll walk it through a door in  here  what the fuck's gonna happen the  hallway starts stretching out a  little bit like they get these  special effects going you walk to  the end of the door open it and  you'll hear like  and this girl will just be standing  there when you turn around you'll  hear a sound because it's all  stereo so you hear a sound to your  right you turn your character right  and this creepy girl  you're dead  like you stand  it scares the shit out of you and 
[03:50:00]  then she breaks apart into this  black powder  and then it's like you gotta you  gotta you're playing it  you just go okay i can't even  really watch  like yeah doom 3 has a has a  character they created it's called  the baby worm  and it's a worm with a baby's face  and it makes that it and it goes  i can't let me try to get on a  blow the mic out it goes  it's a fake cry and then it's just a 
[03:50:30]  horrible scream and then little bugs  so you're shooting baby face bugs  yeah that you have to kill you know  what i mean and you see in this  flashlights and it's and it's just  it's just you go what this is not fun  like i remember asteroids it was like  all right the dopest thing to do is to 
[03:51:00]  for asteroids was to push turbo push  to push to push the the the rocket  button and see how many times you can  fly through the month  before you get nailed  uh-oh he got a little ship  yeah i'm good now it's just  there's no scores here's the the games  don't even have like a health meter  you don't have to pick up health packs  anymore because in real vietnam or  wherever the fuck they didn't have  health health  what no fucking health packs some vc 
[03:51:30]  shoots you you're dead you're dead  there was one game i played where  okay there was a medic you had to keep  the medic alive because that nigga had  the health right so it's like you get  shot once in the arm you got to heal  yourself because you're bleeding so you  gotta go get the medic go to the medic  keep him alive and it's just like why  why why are you fucking joking and they  don't have whoever's in charge of this  shit out there for these games please  can every game have a cheat code so i  can have fun playing the fucking game 
[03:52:00]  can halo get one please can these games  get a goddamn cheat code i'm against the  cheat code you don't you know i will  sit there and toil through a game to  figure it out you really had a cheat i  really are relentless i can't punch in  the cheat codes for the games i gotta get  through that's why i like every game to  have a fucking save uh at any point you  want not when you reach a checkpoint then  you get fucking save i want to save it  every day once i i've saved two seconds 
[03:52:30]  after the last save sometimes you get  through a real difficult part of the  game boom save i did it once i don't  want to have to go through it 10 times  i did it i got through that part why  should i if i get shot like fucking 10  minutes later do i have to now run  through this part of the game again well  that's a prerequisite now that they have  all games you could just stop there are  some games though you got to reach a  checkpoint before you're able to save  it or you get three saves max per segment  of fame right fuck that i want to save 
[03:53:00]  everything i just jumped over the fucking  crevice i just jumped over a log save  yeah save someone i just shot the guy  that was around this corner save on him  coming back and shoot me in the back like  a saving private fucking ryan everyone  dies in my fucking games i just jumped  over logs i don't care if some nazi is  sitting there going with his hands behind  his head boom dead save save that fucker  ain't coming back i'm never ever seeing him 
[03:53:30]  in the game again and then wait they got  games like that it's moral code like your  morale you can choose your destiny shoot  the german in his head right let him go  because maybe he's a good guy and it  changes you for the rest of the game  changes your path whole life yeah i shoot  him in the fucking head all the time  you got it let's go to michael long  island mike what's up what's up boys  hey i was playing uh resident evil 
[03:54:00]  outbreak and uh the next night i had  nightmares i was at the level where you're  fighting a leech man so the next night i'm  sleeping in bed about three o'clock in the  morning i just swing out of bed start  yelling leeches leeches i have leeches all  over my body my wife wakes up it looks  like i'm throwing them off my body she's  like what the fuck is wrong with you then i  lay back and go back to sleep  they're so scary now the first game i 
[03:54:30]  ever played that was petrifying like that  was half-life it's called half-life and  it had a great story for the time and  this is like maybe 96 or no 90 98 maybe  half-life was yeah the graphics were  fantastic gameplay ai everything for that  time it was the game it made game of the  year in every freaking magazine i love the  game uh half-life 2 came out it's all  right not as good as the first but  they're trying to build it up they did  too yeah a little bit they their their ai is  amazing and they have um ragdoll graphics 
[03:55:00]  for the people you shoot so they fall off  rooftops and just their arms will bend  behind their fucking head right and the  gravity gun is very cool but talk about  scary games that game you'd be walking  through these ductworks you know through  the ductwork and these things called head  crabs come out of nowhere and just go  and latch onto your face and you gotta  like beat them with crowbars just to get  rid of them a petrifying game another 
[03:55:30]  one was called Deus Ex I heard of that  that was a good game the original not  that didn't get no props though no it had a  lot of flaws but it was scary it was scary  in a more of a sci-fi way I had to get  through I physically jumped out of my  chair I came through this ductwork to a  vent into a storage room so I popped the  vent out I look to my left there's  nothing there I look to my right there's  this big two-legged RoboCop machine that 
[03:56:00]  just goes and looks at you and starts  shooting I didn't expect it so much I  fell out of my chair fell out I don't  like being afraid of these guys I mean I  would think the granddaddy I mean somebody  could be wrong but I would think the  granddaddy of fear was was Resident Evil  yeah and that just play the Silent Hill  games I you know it's not I couldn't get  through Silent Hill the thing on on  Resident Evil that got me the first one  and the other one scared me too the one  with the with the with the guy what's the 
[03:56:30]  fucking monster the creation they made in  the last movie and he just would be like  umbrellas oh yeah that guy's umbrella core  the umbrella core but I was walking through  the goddamn hallway and if my my lights  were off I was chilling out Resident Evil  and the evil dogs jumped through the  fucking window and my body wouldn't allow  me to push whatever button I needed to  push and I didn't I said this is not why 
[03:57:00]  am I playing this like there's no way you  should be afraid to play a fucking game  yeah and it just was scary you know what  I mean and it's just nowadays dude I  heard this thing condemned Bobby was  telling me condemned he's like dude he's  calling me telling you know like it's a  real murder yeah dude and you're walking  with a flashlight and these crackhead dude  things yeah Bobby's really into this shit  I'm like man I don't need that shit man  I'm I'm I'm I'm getting pissed off at  this walk I'm like give me give me uh uh

[03:58:00]  his fucking pockets while they're shooting so  you you gotta duck down and yeah and a guy  goes go check his pockets and you're like  okay and you're looking you go I got I got a clip  so I can continue on  yeah yeah choose the right weapon you go  okay all right now okay I picked up so if you if  you pick if you make gotta make decisions you go  either I'm gonna pick up a machine gun right or I'm

[03:59:00]  tickle beam and then four death balls it  works all the fucking time baby got an  entire squad  all right we got to talk about this  dominatrix uh out west air anywhere I think  she's in Arizona Arizona I don't know if it's  to Tucson or Phoenix I really don't know  where she is in Arizona I've never met her I've  only seen her online and and done tremendous  damage to myself looking at her video clips

[04:00:00]  if somebody uh is is into it they should be beaten within an inch of their life  by by these broads you're so right Ed she doesn't do oh yeah she doesn't like it's phony  I don't like living in the fantasy world yeah it's a fantasy phony thing and they should just  be beaten where they are found on the floor and if they didn't get to the hospital that  minute they would die that's a true dominatrix that's a dom not the fuzzy handcuffs like they're 
[04:00:30]  they're velcroed on yeah scary stuff here oh I'm trapped I'm trapped I'm out  what kind of crap is that this girl I just Jimmy's getting frustrated we just don't live in that  world no I'm not into that either dude not at all not at all we've seen Jimmy he's not into the  spanking no but when I say not live in the world like you understand on some level I don't  understand yeah I just don't I don't get that there are guys that like that hardcore I mean  I've I've met one hardcore dom in my life like that was for she wouldn't take safe words or any

[04:05:00]  things that are like I'm I'm sickly I need to be in your care kind of a thing it's a motherly thing  almost it can be or could also be a candy striper type thing where they're just hot chicks and like  little short skirts well that's totally that that is completely different if there's a girl in a  rubber nurse suit with that big red cross on her hat get away from me that's ridiculous but a candy 
[04:05:30]  striper thing that's kind of cool you know that's cool but but as long as it doesn't go into this  extravagant scripted role-playing oh I hate that you have been a bad boy yeah yes I have I sure  have I have nurse oh no what are you gonna do what are you gonna do you know sometimes when I'm kissing

[04:12:00]  or off or that goes on it it's sitting in the dishwasher right next to your champagne flute right  next to the scooby-doo sippy cup yeah because we're gonna like do a separate uh load for the uh sex  toys right right gals better throw it all in the dishwasher and get the ready uh get the kids ready for  school that's the uh most embarrassing thing though it's like the cleanup time always has been yeah 
[04:12:30]  just because it's all fine and dandy until everything's laying around the room in the  bedroom and and then you're like oh it's cleanup time try making small talk when you're folding  plastic bags and gargling with peroxide  but um by the way i know a dom who who did guys plushies and she said there was one guy that loved it  one guy she sees she makes come out to the car pay for her cab he's totally nude 
[04:13:00]  when he pays for her cab walk out into the street that's part of the gig part of the gig it's the  public humiliation ah and she'll put him in a rabbit outfit or something i should call her uh and ask  her check in at the overlook hotel yeah get a room upstairs great party yeah and then she'll uh  bury an axe in someone's chest no but she's she said these guys are real wacko she's hardcore man  she's uh she's really nice wow i don't i don't see her in that capacity fast forward to the police  station you're dressed in yeah in a rabbit oh god i didn't know it'd go so far
