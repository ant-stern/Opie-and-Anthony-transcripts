<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opens with a highly vulgar and sexually explicit discussion focusing on Catherine Webb, girlfriend of Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron, and her sudden surge in Twitter followers after appearing on television during the national championship game.  The hosts, along with Jim Norton, analyze photos of her, offering explicit commentary on her physical attributes.  Caller Jimmy James contributes to the conversation, mentioning Brent Musburger's on-air reaction.  The conversation then shifts to workplace dynamics at SiriusXM, specifically targeting Sal, a producer, with vulgar insults and descriptions focusing on his perceived lack of work ethic and his misrepresentation of his relationship with Opie.  A running gag about Sal's lack of interaction with Opie dominates a significant portion, culminating in a discussion of Sal's recent sexual encounter with a female coworker, including a bet on whether he can prove it happened.  Opie reveals he knows the coworker, further fueling the discussion.  Sam Roberts is present in studio during a segment where Sal calls in to provide explicit details of the encounter, further emphasizing his inability to achieve orgasm. Sam contributes to the humorous speculation about the event. This segment is interspersed with ad reads and transitions into a discussion of an Alex Jones interview with Piers Morgan regarding gun control, including clips from the interview.

The show continues with a discussion sparked by a listener's comment on mental health and gun ownership, leading to a debate on gun control criteria, felon disenfranchisement, and societal attitudes towards mental illness. A contentious debate ensues between the hosts and a pre-recorded segment featuring Alex Jones' interview with Piers Morgan, where Jones argues against stricter gun control.  The hosts challenge Jones' claims, referencing Sandy Hook, Fast and Furious, and Jones' perceived paranoia.  The conversation then shifts to lighter topics, revisiting Catherine Webb and Brent Musburger's commentary, before moving to tangents including an advertisement for a relationship guide narrated by a Dr. Andrew Dice Clay Silverstein; discussions of Elvis Presley's alleged continued existence, Vanilla Ice's plagiarism, and numerous "shitting your pants" stories, including one from George Brett.  Tom Papa is briefly present in studio during this segment. The segment concludes with discussion about an absent co-worker and unresolved conflict with a superior.

The show then attempts to contact Eddie Money, before transitioning to a discussion about the upcoming appearance of Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jamie Lannister from Game of Thrones),  including playful mispronunciations and discussion of graphic sex scenes and a violent death from the show. This is followed by discussions about the hosts' and Tom Papa's travel experiences and sleep difficulties, particularly Jim Norton's elaborate sleep routine.  The focus shifts to Buzz Aldrin's divorce and the hosts' outrage at the financial outcome, followed by an anecdote about a rude encounter with Aldrin.  The conversation then explores the vastness of space, contrasting it with the ocean's depths, including a humorous segment on "vague space knowledge," touching upon quantum physics and the uncertainty principle.  Childhood reminiscences and the changing understanding of the solar system are also included.  Regular Joe participates, offering comedic interruptions.  The segment concludes with an advertisement for Steven Singer Jewelers.

A later segment focuses heavily on *Game of Thrones* and horror movies, featuring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in studio.  Coster-Waldau discusses his role, the filming process, and the show's popularity. The hosts engage in their usual crude banter, including running jokes about "Stupid DeRosa," a fictional "souffle box" (later corrected to "Sharnbox"), and plans to expand their studio. The conversation also includes the actors' experiences with horror films, their reactions to scary movies, and the reasons behind the appeal of horror. The segment ends with a discussion of Coster-Waldau's career, his audition process, and thoughts on social media, concluding with a humorous discussion about Sal and advertisements.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All aboard! All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show!  Not before has one radio show been so extreme.  It's gonna melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker!  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So fledgling. 
[00:00:30]  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, alright, you'll be an Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  This is good practice when I do the view.  Quite simply.  The greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And convention burns the ground.  Don't do it.  I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  It's cock.  With Opie the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony.  The rage.  Yeah, yeah.  Your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy in the peanut.  And Jim Norton.  Lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass.  It makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful.  But I just can't take them. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie Anthony Show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  And why not?  Why don't we do that?  That's a little hi-hat.  Every day I pick out a little part I like from this.  Today it's the hi-hat.  Nice.  Alabama man. 
[00:02:00]  I was looking forward to watching some college football.  Yeah.  Sure.  Got a national title on the line.  Oh yeah?  Oh, you don't know that.  Do you know that?  What's that?  Did you know that?  What?  You were like playing for the national title?  I gotta be honest.  I could say no and sound like the idiot that I am concerning all things football.  So I will.  No.  I'm an idiot.  College football is pretty awesome.  Is it though? 
[00:02:30]  Unless there's a massive blowout like we had last night and then it's a bore fest unless  you're looking at Alabama man's girlfriend.  Bama?  Bama won?  The only reason we're bringing it up is because of Alabama man's girlfriend.  The quarterback.  Yeah, Bama won.  What was the final?  I was out early.  41-14?  Something like that?  My fighting Irish lost!  I can't believe it, Kelvin.  Was it close or a blowout?  It was a complete blowout.  42.  Okay.  42-14 was the final.  Wow.  Alabama beats Notre Dame winning the national title.  And everyone beat their pud to the Alabama quarterback's girlfriend. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  That's the big story.  That's the big story.  That's the thing.  This guy's got to be pissed off.  I don't even know his name.  I don't even know his name.  What the fuck's his name?  I don't know.  I have no idea because everyone is talking about the Alabama QB's girlfriend.  AJ.  AJ McCarron.  No one gives a fuck about him.  It's all about his girlfriend today.  If you haven't heard yet, I'm sure you will a lot.  Yeah.  We get to break the news first, and then later on you'll hear it and go, you know, I don't 
[00:03:30]  know what A and Jim Norton were talking about that earlier.  I don't know the O and A show.  But basically they show the Alabama quarterback's girlfriend.  AJ McCarron.  AJ McCarron.  Yeah.  You looked that up, sir.  No, I just remembered it.  Do you?  Well, no one's going to remember him.  No.  And I think that's going to kind of fuck up the relationship a little bit.  So anyway, they show her, and she had 2,000 Twitter followers.  She had 2,000 Twitter followers. 
[00:04:00]  Okay.  And now the story is that she has 100,000.  But I bet you it's way higher than that now.  Probably.  Because I bet you they can't keep up with the numbers.  I guess they put her on cam.  So let's find her Twitter, first of all.  I guess they put her on cam last night.  Yes.  And we're like, and here's AJ's girlfriend here in the stand supporting her man.  And her Twitter blew up because she's pretty hot.  And the announcers were basically talking about how hot she is.  And if we could find that audio today, that would be great.  Is that it?  I know we have a skeleton crew, but if we could find it, that would be wonderful. 
[00:04:30]  Catherine Webb, her name is?  So it's all about Catherine Webb today.  See?  The paper's saying 100,000.  Well, no.  That went up another 13,000 since they printed the article.  And with all the news coverage, now it'll be even higher.  Because that was just people watching the game.  My bet is she does, oh, man, I want to say a mil.  I want to say it.  I want to be accurate, though.  I would guarantee she has a half million Twitter followers by the end of today.  That's my bet.  So let's keep track of this. 
[00:05:00]  Right now it's 113,000.  Why don't you refresh her Twitter and let's see.  Let's see what her picture is first.  Which one now?  Oh, my.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my gosh.  She's got a little young Jill Nicolini in her.  I was looking at that for a second.  A little young Jill Nicolini in the eyes.  Yes, yes.  There's something.  When the picture first flashed on, I was like, oh, okay.  Yes.  All right.  But you know what absolutely does not look like Nicolini?  The guys they sleep with.  It's just like a quarterback. 
[00:05:30]  Exactly.  A little refresh.  It's just sitting there right now.  It's sitting at 113,000 followers.  Why don't you go through all our pictures down there?  Let's see.  Yeah, let's see some of them pictures.  Is that her with the Alabama quarterback guy?  Oh, Jesus.  Is that him?  Yeah, no one cares about him.  A prick.  All right.  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Oh, okay.  There it is.  The mirror shot.  That's called a selfie.  A selfie?  Yeah, in the social networking world, that's called a selfie.  Oh, lovely. 
[00:06:00]  She's doing a selfie with a Bama jersey on.  She is a lovely one.  That's where the quarterback gets self.  Yep.  Yep.  Let's see what else.  Oh, my.  Okay.  All right.  She's got some kind of tiara on.  What is she wearing?  She's Miss Alabama.  She's Miss Alabama.  Oh.  Well, how long does she leave Alabama?  Yes, Jim.  We got it.  It's too early for that shit.  Oh, my God. 
[00:06:30]  What the fuck?  Is that her sister?  Is that her funny-looking sister?  She's funny-looking.  What's wrong with you?  Nothing.  Her sister's a nine-and-a-half, and she's a ten.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a slight drop-off.  Wow.  All right.  This is Alabama shit.  Oh, boy.  There's that dork.  He kind of looks dorky.  He looks 12.  That's not a good picture of her.  No, no, no.  A big, dumb smile.  Yeah, she, you know, they take good ones.  They take bad ones this weekend.  All right.  Well, it keeps going.  Oh, she's on the cover of Weddings Magazine.  Alabama Weddings Magazine. 
[00:07:00]  Alabama Weddings.  That's-  Oh, shit.  All right.  There she is.  T-shirt.  All right.  As Miss East.  What is that?  East Alabama?  What?  I guess.  Miss East Alabama?  And you know they've got to make them wear the fuddy-duddy bikinis.  I know.  They try to make-  They try to sex it up, but you could tell, like, if she was on the beach, she would cut  down those sides even more.  Of course.  You could tell.  Yeah.  And the bra strap's a little too big.  Uh-huh. 
[00:07:30]  Whoa.  Yeah, but that's all right.  That's pretty good.  Let her rip.  Mm-hmm.  Oh, shit.  All right.  On a little vacation.  Whoa.  Which one is she?  The one in the middle?  The one in the middle, right?  I think so.  It's not the beast on the left who you know is just a big party girl.  Woo!  That chick right there is going, woo!  She's the one that, like, will put her cigarette in her mouth to lift up her shirt to show you  her tits with her eyes all squinted.  That's hot.  That's her.  Oh, God.  All right. 
[00:08:00]  What?  All right.  The obligatory dog pictures.  Family, friends, the meme.  That fucking thing.  Oh, God.  Who cares?  Blueberries, a chair.  Oh, my God.  Come on.  Keep going, Sam.  We're running out of pictures.  Come on.  All right.  Whoa.  Okay.  What do we got here?  Oh, look at the one on the right.  Looks like a young Demi Moore.  Yeah.  And the one in the middle is all right.  Oh, boy.  No.  Yeah.  She has some nice cheekbones in the middle.  Jesus.  She's a cheekbone girl.  Lovely cheekbone features.  Let's keep going.  All right.  We got one in the left. 
[00:08:30]  Is that her?  That's her on the left.  The monolith.  She is fucking.  She's tall.  Statuesque, Opie.  Statuesque.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  This is how we start our show?  Yeah.  Going through her fucking.  Fair enough.  Wow.  Twit pics.  She does hang out with some hot friends, unless they're also contestants.  That's it.  That's it.  That's pretty good.  All right.  So the quarterback had a good game.  Yeah.  Yeah, but no one cares.  No.  He just won a national title, and everyone's talking about his girlfriend.  About his fucking check.  You've got to think he's.  Oh.  Whoa. 
[00:09:00]  Hey.  What?  What happened?  You Google image, and some even better shots come up.  How does a picture come up and then go away?  I like that.  It was too hot for the internet.  It was too hot.  Too hot to handle.  Too hot.  Too hot to handle.  Oh.  Bikini shot.  Oh.  All right.  Can you open that one?  I want to zoom in on the crotch of the blue pants.  Of course you do.  Yeah, yeah.  Zoom in on that camel toe.  Let's see if we have camel toe.  What do they call it?  It looks a little chubby.  It looks nice.  Probably a tamp.  She has nice model hips. 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, but they got to keep everything on the up and up down there when they're in competition.  They don't want no pussy lips showing.  No, they'll probably put a tampon or something or a maxi pad.  A maxi pad.  I think they use modeling clay.  And fill in the slit.  Make her look like a Barbie doll.  Caulk that shit up.  Yeah, some caulk.  Oh, there's her butt.  Terrible.  I've seen it.  It doesn't look good in that bikini.  Or in that bathing suit. 
[00:10:00]  It's a one piece.  It doesn't look good.  Her face is, uh...  Wow.  Okay.  That's her moneymaker is her face.  Her face is definitely her moneymaker.  She's got a nice body, though.  Got the nice hips.  And by the way, that quarterback, what do you think?  You think he won that game and then fucking banged her?  Uh...  Uh...  Oh, man.  How many Twitter followers does she have now?  Uh, right.  This is the...  If you're just tuning in, the Alabama quarterback's girlfriend was shown on TV.  She had 2,000 Twitter followers.  Now she has 113,000. 
[00:10:30]  Still sitting there.  Why is it sitting there?  That doesn't seem right.  What the fuck?  There's people awake somewhere fucking starting to follow her.  Watching the news.  Now I just shot up to 113,500.  How much does her boyfriend have?  She just hit...  She just did another 1,500 since we talked about her.  1,500.  Isn't that amazing?  I'm telling you.  You know what?  I think the saying a half million is going to be a little low.  Yeah.  I think it's going to be a little low.  Today, with all this fucking news coverage it's getting...  I think she might push a million Twitter followers by this time tomorrow. 
[00:11:00]  Because she was only getting...  Make sure we check tomorrow, right?  She was only getting followers from the people watching the game.  Right, and now it's on every news thing.  Now it's on all the news channels.  So it's people that don't even know about football, but love following beautiful girls.  Yeah, keep us updated on that, Sam.  Oh, yes.  Throughout the morning.  That's priority.  But she's already done 1,500 followers in 15 minutes.  10 minutes, let's call it.  We were talking about earlier before the show, Ovi was bringing up the fact that now this  poor fucking quarterback has to deal with the assholes that are just going to fucking 
[00:11:30]  light her up.  Right.  Yeah, she's not that hard.  The trolls and the haters.  Yeah, you know what?  Fuck that.  She's a five at best.  Show your chick.  Show your fat fucking sow pig.  Why don't you show that?  You phony lumps of shit.  She's fucking...  That's any girl walking down the street.  Try to fuck on the chicks without your dumb bullshit. 
[00:12:00]  Assholes.  There's so many of those.  I think you said it the other day.  It's the decade of the asshole.  The decade of the asshole.  It really just is the decade of the asshole.  Every asshole has a voice.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, you know what?  She's all right, but fuck you.  I got one the other day.  Oh, gained a few pounds, did you?  The decade of the asshole.  Show me your fucking picture.  Yeah.  Mr. Egg on Twitter.  Right.  Yeah, the fucking egg on Twitter is the first one that criticizes everything. 
[00:12:30]  Oh, you mean the eggs that followed, what?  One person?  Yeah.  One follower, two tweets.  Follow one person.  It's you.  And then they just bash you.  I don't even click on those anymore.  I don't even look at them.  Don't even look at them.  I understand.  You fucking hate my guts, and you're going to have multiple Twitter accounts to tell me so.  I've been to parties and fucked drunk chicks hotter than hers.  Oh, have you?  Have you?  Someone says she has 25,000 more followers than her boyfriend. 
[00:13:00]  He has 90.  Oh, that's going to make a problem.  And he just won the national title.  Right.  That's the world we live in.  Your girlfriend is way more important than the national title you just won for Bama.  She's going to pull away really quick, too, as far as followers go.  Oh, yeah.  Well, let's see.  Yeah.  I just...  She just gained another 100, 200 followers?  Since the last time we hit the old refresh.  Yeah.  Well, this guy's got some info on that guy. 
[00:13:30]  Jimmy James, one of the regulars from New Hampshire.  Ooh.  What's up, Jimmy James?  Morning, boys.  What's up?  First, Brett Musburger last night going full creep mode when they showed her on screen was blasted.  Brett Musburger, yeah?  Yeah, that's why I want the fucking clip.  We've got to find the clip.  Because it wasn't like that.  Hold on, hold on, JJ.  I'm helping you out.  It wasn't like they just showed her.  Then he was, like, talking about how hot she was.  Oh, Jesus.  I'd fucking lick her asshole.  He's on fucking... 
[00:14:00]  Oh, yeah.  Imagine just feeling that tight fucking asshole on your tongue.  Yeah, he lost it.  His perv switch went off a little bit.  It went off.  It was Brett Musburger and his perfect sports voice doing an impression of Ant doing the,  my, what have we here?  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Quite a gorgeous gal here on the...  Do you got it?  Yeah.  All right.  I bet this isn't it.  Hold on, JJ.  Stay on the line.  When you're a quarterback at Alabama, you see that lovely lady there?  She does go to Auburn. 
[00:14:30]  I want to admit that.  But she also, this Alabama, and that's AJ McCarron's girlfriend.  Okay?  Okay.  And right there on the right is Dee Dee Bonner.  That's AJ's mom.  Wow.  I'm telling you, quarterbacks, you get all the good-looking women.  What a beautiful woman.  Oh!  AJ's doing some things right down the road.  Whoa!  A youngster in Alabama.  Start getting the football out and throw it around the back yard.  That's pretty funny.  That is funny.  Wow.  She's quite attractive.  He basically is saying, if you want a hot chick, start throwing that football around 
[00:15:00]  the back yard.  Be the quarterback, and you'll be fucking funneling those great tits on this bitch.  Look at her.  She's beautiful.  He's doing everything right.  This guy.  Look what he got.  Right there.  That's his girlfriend.  He's going home tonight and fucked the shit out of her.  Boy, I would like to.  I'm actually going to screen cap her and jerk off to her later in the bathroom.  Musburger was trying to keep his teeth in his mouth there, JP.  Is he talking over his dentures?  I don't know.  It sounded a little like, you know.  Does he have dentures? 
[00:15:30]  A little loose.  A little loose.  A little loose.  They have to just say their eshes like this.  A little loose.  You got it.  Because the second you do this, when you have to push your tongue against your teeth,  they could fly out.  Yes.  Is that what it is?  Yeah, sure.  You got to say it like this.  A little loose.  Show what I was, yeah, because that's, oh, you're in danger of that popping right  out.  Yes.  Dentures.  JJ, very good pick up there, sir.  And one more thing.  I just to prove your point that nobody gives a shit about A.J. 
[00:16:00]  McCarron.  He's the first quarterback in the history of college football to win two back-to-back  national championships, and nobody cares.  Who gives a shit?  Is he going to the NFL?  I don't know.  He won't even be a sixth-round pick, Jimmy.  Why'd he say that?  He's just, he's Matt Leinart at best.  What's that mean?  He's Chris Winkie.  He's one of those college superstars that just won't pan out.  Who's Chris Winkie?  Has I been fixed?  He won with Florida State.  Is he in the NFL? 
[00:16:30]  He was for like a week and a half.  The Jets should take him.  Right?  Because the Jets don't have a quarterback.  Thank you.  All right, boys.  Thanks.  Bucket out.  All right.  Go punch yourself.  Yeah.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Jimmy James or Jimmy Jame?  I was just laughing, driving in, thinking.  Out of nowhere, I was like, James Gum or Jame Gum?  Whose name is Jame?  No one is.  No one.  No one.  That was a terrible guess.  It's Jame Gum.  There's always J and a G, though. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  It's James Gum or Jaka-ra-ra-ba-ba-gum.  Yeah.  It makes no sense.  No one named Jame.  Jame Gum?  We have an update on her Twitter followers.  Oh.  Yeah.  She's picked up another 150 since she's last checked.  Holy crap, man.  Catherine Webb.  Yeah, because the paper's saying 100,000.  They're way off already.  Now she's pushing 114,000.  Catherine Webb.  All right.  So, I guess the game was good.  Power couple right there.  Yeah.  Pretty clean.  What year is he in?  Is he done? 
[00:17:30]  Quarterback.  I'm not going to front.  I'm not going to front.  Oh, man.  I have no idea.  You know who I bet knows everything about this?  Travis.  Ron Bennington.  Oh.  Bennington likes it.  Is he a college football guy?  Yeah.  And Fez.  Fez Watley, too.  I bet he knows a lot about this A.J. McCarron guy.  If I want all my A.J. McCarron news, I bet I listen to Ron and Fez, and I get it.  Why does he know about that?  Is he a college football?  They're a big college football show.  Yeah, he'll actually talk about the game.  We'll talk about the hot girl.  Right.  That's the difference.  Yeah, they're very big into college ball.  I wish I liked it.  Even Fezzy knows, right? 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, yeah.  I shouldn't say even Fezzy knows.  Fezzy is always known.  Yeah.  But I wish it was.  It was always on Saturdays, and I wish I could fucking watch it.  Who's this moose walking down the hall?  I don't know.  Holy fuckaroni.  I guess he's some muscle for Liberty Media.  Oh, you think he's Liberty's muscle?  Yeah, taking a little look.  Walking the hall, walking the perimeter.  Taking a little look-see.  Seeing who needs a fucking ass beating before they get thrown out of this motherfucker.  Do you see all the shit in the hallways when you try to make it down to our studio?  What's going on?  It's like, can we clean up the place?  We got new owners coming in.  It's like hoarders run this joint. 
[00:18:30]  You walk down the hall, and there's just boxes of shit.  Today, I was walking with Chris, and I pointed out everything that's been there forever.  And I'm not one of those guys.  I'm like, you see this portable studio set up?  That's been there for years.  Oh, the one in the bathroom where you walk to the bathroom?  And then I go, you see these picture frames?  They've been fucking crooked for years.  No one straightens them up.  And not crooked in a way like an OCD fucking asshole would notice.  They are so crooked, and no one gives a fuck.  And half of them are missing off the wall. 
[00:19:00]  How about that one little hallway in between that's always fucking closed and clogged up  with air conditioning, ductwork stuff?  Oh, that's what that is?  Yeah.  Oh, I was going to bring my kid in and have him play in that area.  You thought it was like one of those McDonald's playland things?  I thought he could crawl through half that shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was like hoarders running this joint.  I guess it's 54 days and counting before Liberty takes over.  Is that the timeline they're on?  And it's official, but they had to wait 60 days for whatever reason?  Here's my fucking prediction. 
[00:19:30]  Goodbye!  Within a week of them taking control,  because they're assessing now,  they are going to blow people right the fuck out of here.  Oh, I thought you were going to say they're going to blow people.  What a lovely way to come into the company.  Just to say hi, how do you do?  But who's left?  Do you understand how many people have left here  since we moved into this building?  Dude, you don't think.  There's so many people that are long gone.  It might be the people upstairs we've never met.  How about Rob, Radio Wizard, and Bladder? 
[00:20:00]  You don't see some redundancy there?  Oh, good.  That can fucking, something can be looked at and said,  well, we got three people here.  What's your job?  What's your job?  What's your job?  All right.  Maybe we only need two.  Maybe we only need one.  What exactly is it you do here?  And when they sit us down for the official meeting,  I'm going to tell them who needs to stay and who needs to go.  Yeah, you'll be like the guy in office space.  You'll just sit down and go,  That's right.  Ah, you know, I come in.  The only incentive is to do as much work as you need to do to keep your job. 
[00:20:30]  Am I right?  The two Bobs are going to come in and fucking clean the house.  Radio Wizard wrote me last night.  He's the Radio Wizard?  He actually called me.  I didn't answer that.  Why?  Were you not home or you didn't have your phone on you?  I'll be honest.  I do not answer phone calls from Gary or Rob because I know there's nothing they could tell me. 
[00:21:00]  That's the God's honest truth.  Bobby, when you say these things, do you realize that they might hear it?  Yeah.  That's what makes it fun.  And it might hurt their little feelings.  Yeah, but what are you going to do, man?  We want to do an even better show, believe it or not.  I hear you.  I know we fuck around and we act like we don't, but we certainly do.  I'm with you on that whole thing.  And he's in our way.  So he calls, so I'm like, am I really going to pick up a phone call from him? 
[00:21:30]  No.  Oh, man, you looked at your phone and actually said...  I love missing someone's call and then you tweet something right after it so they know you had the phone in your hand.  He says, no, I did that for my computer and it says, tweet it for my phone.  Well, I did give him the courtesy of just texting him.  I said, what's up?  Oh, that's nice.  Although I don't think so in this case because I don't see the what's ups.  That's what I usually do.  It's like, you're worth a text, but I really want to hear your fucking voice. 
[00:22:00]  You know what?  There was no what's up.  You could see for yourself.  Oh, shit.  No what's up.  So he writes, I have an update on the studio.  Remember, we're trying to knock the wall.  Ah, an update.  Day five.  Day five.  Day five of Move That Wall.  We're trying to take over the Martha Stewart area.  Mm-hmm.  So is a lot of other people.  Shade 45, Morning Mashup, and the talent department for some fuck reason.  Because when they do interviews, sometimes someone will interview and they have no place to put them.  Hey, fuck them. 
[00:22:30]  Hey, I say it like when they'll have a big director or a big actor or a big singer or a big guitar player.  They're perhaps a big screenwriter.  But in that case, then you could use the studio.  Who cares?  Who uses OutQ after the morning?  Let me explain something.  When we're on the air, if the talent department has talent, most likely they're going to be in our studio.  All right.  And the same is true for Ron and Fez.  Most of them that come through.  Sure.  So then when Ron and Fez are over, then they could use the studio for other talent. 
[00:23:00]  You specifically in the past said this is the one studio nobody's allowed to use.  I said it the other day, though.  If it gets this done, then we're going to have to, you know.  Jimmy was the one who said fuck everyone.  I said we'll have to work with people a little bit.  So it's day five.  I'll move that wall.  And Gary called me last night.  I refused to talk to him.  And then he wrote me and he said, I have an update on the studio.  Call me when you have a second.  Oh.  And then what?  Call me when you have a second.  That was at 5.01 p.m.  Oh, so what did he say when you called him? 
[00:23:30]  I never called him.  What?  And then he adds, or, because he knows I wasn't going to call him.  He goes, or I'll pop in off air.  Off air?  There's that off air shit again.  We don't do it off air.  Can I ask you something?  What's the big deal if he gave us the info on air?  What could possibly be top secret about this that he has to do it off air?  Some things they do do off air.  Do do.  I'll tell you why. 
[00:24:00]  Because he doesn't want to be beat up.  No.  Accountability.  What do you mean?  When it's over the air and it's out there, it's been said.  Other people are witness to that.  Right.  And he cannot pull back, change what he said.  When he just says it off the air, in a week, two weeks, a month even, he could come back  and go, oh, no, no.  What I said was, or what I meant was, or this one, or I heard from this, or that wasn't  my words.  Now you've got the entire audience saying, no, you said this.  Here's the clip.  And the audience is vested in this. 
[00:24:30]  Exactly.  So it has to be on air.  Correct.  And if he tries the off air crap, I will go with the la la la la thing all day long.  Yes.  It's the same reason he didn't text or email.  Right.  Because then there is a hard copy.  He wants you to hear it on the phone so that it just goes away.  It's in the fucking vapor, the ether, the cosmos.  Yeah.  That's not how it is.  He can't accuse you of fudging around.  Very good, Jimmy.  Watch the language, though.  It's a family show.  What do you think he's going to say?  I love when they go, okay, this is not for air. 
[00:25:00]  Not for air.  We've been hearing this for 18 years.  Everything's for air.  Okay, this is not for air.  No, that's the best stuff for air.  Exactly.  When are you going to figure that out?  Jesus Christ.  Obviously, if you say it's not for air, that's when you put it on the air.  You don't think everything in my life, there's been some things that have not been for air  that ended up on the air?  Of course.  Because we had a slow day.  Of course.  And I decided to fucking open up.  Okay, this is not for air.  Not for air.  Get your fucking ass in here and put it on the air.  I want accountability.  When does he come in today? 
[00:25:30]  I'm guessing 9.55.  Oh, Jesus.  Probably before 9.55.  Can we all guess when he gets here?  Oh.  I like playing a Radio Wizard guessing game.  We guessed yesterday what his answer would be.  Our shift starts at 6-ish.  Ish.  And he decides to come in around 9-ish.  Ish.  But if you're in charge of the channel, not that we want him around, but I'll say it for  the 100th time, when you get your ass in here right at 6.  Yes.  If your job is to oversee this shit.  You'd think. 
[00:26:00]  I say.  I'm going to guess he's in bright and early, 8.45.  And how do we get a winner to this game?  We can run out and check.  Sal should check every 15 minutes.  I have faith in the little twip.  Oh, what do you say?  I think he'll be here before 8.  Before 8?  Yep.  I think he'll walk in.  We need an exact time.  I got 8.45.  Opie, 8.45.  Jimmy, what's your before 8?  I'm saying 7.59. 
[00:26:30]  I'm, Price is right in you.  All right, well, I said 7.45.  Oh.  7.45, okay.  Hey, fucker.  And Sal is going for his first check.  Oh, God.  Look at him.  Is he running?  His mustache hairs are falling out with every step.  That fucking shitty stapled in mustache.  That is a horrible mustache.  It's terrible.  Moustache.  Moustache.  Guys, I'm not here yet, but I'm going to guess by 7-something he'll be in.  And he'll have an update on the studio issue. 
[00:27:00]  For off-air.  Yeah, it's big news.  Off-air.  I swear, all day long, if he tries to talk me off-air, I'm just going to go la-la-la as  loud as I can.  La-la-la.  I'm going to go earmuffs and just go la-la-la.  And if he waits until after the show, that's what he's going to see as I walk to the elevator.  Yep.  Sal, why does he have to?  Fucking Sal.  Sal's the stuporst fucking guy here.  Oh, look at him.  And he misrepresented our fucking relationship on the after show yesterday.  Yes, he did.  Yes, he did.  Were you listening to that?  Sal, we have a fucking mic.  Why are you running all the way to EROC to give us an update when you can come right 
[00:27:30]  in here, Sal?  Why?  Oh, my God.  Why are you out of breath?  I'm 22.  What the fuck is wrong with you?  You're a kid.  You're a kid.  You're out of breath from running down the hall?  Yeah.  He's not here.  All right.  I'm saying another timer for 15 minutes.  I'll do it every 15 minutes.  Why did you misrepresent our relationship?  What did you say?  What did you say?  I heard it.  You say we talk basketball.  I'm picturing these two fucking grab-assing after the show.  They're talking sports, entertainment.  Hope he's inviting them over.  I told him before the show, there was a time I started watching the Knicks again, and that 
[00:28:00]  was because of Jeremy Lin.  And so then me and Sal did have something to talk about.  That's about a year ago now.  Okay?  Uh-huh.  And now our conversation is, did you see the Knicks game last night?  And I go, no, I did not.  I got to start watching again.  Like, I don't watch as much because they got rid of Jeremy Lin.  Yeah.  Even though the Knicks are having a great season, by the way.  On the after show yesterday, Sam put it to a dummy here.  Do you think Opie and Anthony like you?  Yeah.  Uh, and he said, oh yeah, Opie likes me. 
[00:28:30]  Opie likes me.  Because, hey, I said based on Opie's treatment.  The way he talks to him.  I, uh-huh!  That was fucking hilarious.  I didn't hear that part.  Iraq, do you have the clip?  Yes, I do.  It's fucking hilarious.  What happened?  The way you ragged, you fucking destroyed Sal yesterday when he came in and he was all  giddy about what happened when we sent him into the vacant studio to talk to the people  that were in there, and he was so excited  about what he did for the show there, 
[00:29:00]  and you just, you fucking trashed him  just by imitating him, like,  I don't even realize I do these things.  That's why I think you hate him.  Right.  No, I just don't like him as much since we hired him.  I still like yourself, but not as much.  That's my real answer.  This is like the college quarterback  and the pro quarterback.  As a college player,  which means the intern, you were great.  As a college player.  As a college guy, quarterback,  you're great, but as a fucking employee, 
[00:29:30]  you wouldn't even be fucking, yeah,  fifth-round draft.  I will say this for Sal.  We did complain about those one sheets,  and then the one today for,  what's his name, Nico?  I can't say his name.  Nico what?  Nicolaj.  I'm going to go Nicolaj Coster-Waldau.  Yes, we did complain,  and then the prep sheet is at least as bad  as the other ones have always been.  Wait, we have the clip.  I got another thing, too. 
[00:30:00]  Here's the clip.  All right, go ahead.  Opie.  You want me to do that?  I wouldn't suggest you.  You want me to do this?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's who will link you.  I don't know.  You never do it.  You want me to do that?  You want me to do it?  He fucking just treated you like a bitch right there.  Can I hear that again?  I didn't realize I'd do this.  You want me to do that?  I wouldn't suggest you.  You want me to do that?  Oh, my God.  That's a little entry.  I don't know.  That's a little entry.  I don't know.  You want me to do that?  All right.  I got another voice. 
[00:30:30]  Beautiful.  A little different from the hater voice.  When that was pointed out yesterday on the after show,  I was fucking laughing.  I didn't even know I did that.  Oh, great.  I picked that by then.  Thank you, Sam.  You're making me a radio star by pointing this shit out.  And then he brought up the fact that you guys,  obviously you made fun for the air and it's for the show  because when you talk sports and entertainment,  the conversations you've had.  We're not talking basketball anymore.  No, we haven't in a while, yeah.  Why would you say that? 
[00:31:00]  No, I mean, you said we had in the past, I said.  Because of Jeremy Lin.  You have that clip where you're in there futzing around.  What clip?  Of the after show.  Which one, though?  Sal saying that you guys are...  I told Sal...  Yeah, we can do it here, though.  He was saying stuff.  But he said we talked music.  Exactly.  When was the last time we talked music?  I'm way behind on my music right now.  Yeah, it's been a couple months since we started music.  What was the last music conversation we had?  No, he didn't say this.  I don't know.  He made it sound like yesterday.  It's long enough that it was...  I knew he was lying.  That part creeped me out because I don't think we've ever talked music. 
[00:31:30]  He made it sound like it was every day, dude.  We talked Jeremy Lin.  You guys are pals.  That's what I thought.  Jeremy Lin hasn't been something to talk about for months.  I said it's been a year.  Yeah.  I'm not watching the Knicks as much because I hate Carmelo Anthony.  As great as he is, I don't like him as a ball player.  I just started feeling like, holy shit, maybe I got to get to know these guys a little better.  Opie's fucking, you know, hanging out and talking with them and shit.  That's what I took away from...  I beg you to give me one music thing we talked about. 
[00:32:00]  I think we spoke about Pearl Jam a while back.  That was...  What did you say about that?  How was it?  Do you guys agree on something?  Yeah.  We both like Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  I mean, just chatting about some tracks.  That was in Travis?  What was that?  Travis loves Pearl Jam.  No, no, no.  It was me and Opie.  You and Travis.  Travis and Opie.  What was the conversation?  Oh.  I don't remember.  It was a while ago.  It was embarrassing now.  Now it's just embarrassing.  I told him not to make things up so that, like...  I didn't make it up.  It would seem like he was better friends.  Right, right.  Or to give me the positive answer because he thought that would make his life easier. 
[00:32:30]  I told him to be honest.  Well, he wasn't.  Holy shit, I'm creeped out.  It was just a while ago.  It's not that it didn't happen.  I never said it was recent.  Are you growing a beard because I'm growing a beard?  No.  Single white female shit going on here?  Oh, boy.  I love my hair like this.  I'm just going to come in with this...  What color hair is mine?  I don't know.  Strutters long.  You're like a chameleon.  I don't know either, right?  You just sink into the background.  Don't dye your hair like mine, man.  I'll fucking get creeped out.  It's getting weird.  It is getting weird. 
[00:33:00]  Can I hear that clip again?  It's creepy.  It's sad.  No, it's funny.  Yeah.  Because we told him to go in and, like, fucking basically tell the Martha Stewart people  if the studio was...  Yeah.  What?  He was supposed to go in and say, is the studio open?  Right.  Because the old Martha Stewart ladies were in there, and he came back all excited because  he had just accomplished his mission, and you took him down a couple of legs immediately.  Let's hear that again.  You want me to do that?  I wouldn't suggest it.  You want me to do that?  Oh, my God.  That's a little leggy. 
[00:33:30]  I don't know.  See, that's just such...  Oh, is that embarrassing?  It's such contempt.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what I said.  That's the way he treats management, Opie.  Yes, yes.  That's the way Opie treats management.  Yep.  Yeah, you're relegated to, like, the same fucking feel as management.  And he hates those guys.  He hates them.  Hates them.  Thus then...  Do we have the clip of Sal actually talking about his relationship?  With what?  With Opie.  I can find it, though.  Oh, I'm so zesty for you. 
[00:34:00]  Because it would be nice to hear, like, how Sal presented it.  I'm pretty much telling you how it's presented.  It creeped me out.  Yeah.  He said off the air, there's, like, they have good conversations.  Yes, yes, yes.  I didn't doll it up that much, though.  That's why I want to hear it.  You kind of did.  You didn't have to doll it up.  It was very as a matter of fact.  And those are the things that come off trying to seem more honest.  It's like, oh, no.  Yeah, we talk.  That's it.  And he said we have conversations.  Have, not had.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[00:34:30]  Here we go.  Oh, Sal.  This is weird.  Oh, Sal.  It's weird and sad and embarrassing.  He said that you like him.  You just like to bust his balls.  I just bust.  I crack whys during the day.  It doesn't carry the way.  That's right.  It doesn't carry.  That's pretty much his M.O. for everything.  Thank you.  And everybody in the studio.  I just.  Once this show ends, I don't give Sal another thought.  Unless, of course, I'm driving, listening to Young Samuel, and you come on the show.  Would you be sad if Sal quit?  I probably wouldn't notice for a while. 
[00:35:00]  And then I'd be like, what happened to that guy with a mustache?  It's sad, but, you know.  And then he's quite sure that Jim likes him.  But I told him, I think Jim just likes him because he comes on the air and annoys people.  Yeah, that's true.  And Jim likes it when there's people who annoy people.  Yes.  I do like Sal.  You know, the prep sheet thing is a real kink in our relationship.  But I do like him.  Thank you, Jim.  You're kind of welcome. 
[00:35:30]  Do you have a girlfriend?  No.  Currently, no.  Oh.  Play in the field.  Yeah.  When was the last girlfriend you had?  Last girlfriend had was.  Come off a little femmy.  Like a.  Jesus.  I'm just saying.  It's like listening to a radio show in the 1950s.  What, do you play center field?  The last, like, serious girlfriend I had was probably last February.  That's when it kind of ended.  Coming up on the year mark.  You were here last February.  Yeah.  I mean, serious girlfriend. 
[00:36:00]  Would you get her one of those fucking roses and she told you to go fuck her?  She broke it across his teeth.  It's been a while.  Wow.  I've had a real relationship like that.  It's probably hard for a hipster to get a girl these days.  No.  Girls just look and go, ugh.  Ugh.  He's a hipster.  I don't want to go out with a hipster.  Yeah.  Wow.  She's like.  She's a woman, man.  And he just looks like a kid.  Oh, you're looking at fucking.  Catherine Webb.  Yeah.  She's up to 115,000 followers now. 
[00:36:30]  By the way.  But there's a picture with.  He's so dumped.  She's so dumping him.  There's a picture with her with the Alabama quarterback.  He looks like a fucking kid.  And she looks like a grown woman.  AJ?  With AJ?  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's a quarterback, dude.  He'll keep her.  Those guys get.  I don't know.  College quarterback.  Look at him.  He's got to get to the pros.  She's a real woman.  Looks like his stepmom.  Oh, God.  She's not moving to Canada because he gets a fucking gig in the CFL. 
[00:37:00]  Oh, boy.  Oh, Jesus.  She's not going to Canada with you, pal.  You've got to get a team interested in him.  East Bama.  East Alabama.  Alabama.  Alabama, bro.  So you don't like Sal like that?  Not really.  It's all right, though.  Oh.  He's misrepresented.  You're right about that.  I don't remember talking about Pearl Jam.  I don't think it ever happened quite often.  Maybe when I went to the Pearl Jam show in Philly, the Made in America concert, maybe he said,  did you have fun or something?  That was in June.  Yeah, I don't know.  I don't really talk about Pearl Jam at that level. 
[00:37:30]  I didn't make it timely.  Six months ago.  I don't really know much about Pearl Jam.  I just like a whole bunch of their songs.  What did you guys say about Pearl Jam?  Defend yourself.  Yeah, really.  I know we spoke about tracks that we like.  I think that was pretty much it.  We just spoke about, oh, yeah, you like this track or I like that track.  And that was pretty much it.  Why?  Wasn't anything deep.  You're lying.  Oh, my God.  You're just lying.  We haven't had more than a 20-second conversation in over a year.  Yeah, I hope he likes me.  One time we talked to you about Pearl Jam six months ago.  I say hi to him every morning.  I sit down in that stupid chair with a bunch of newspapers and a bunch of TVs on. 
[00:38:00]  I just woke up by the time I got here because I'm lucky enough to live really close.  So I don't really have conversations with anybody.  The first conversation I have is with him when he walks in.  Yeah.  And we kind of shoot the shit real fast about what happened the night before.  Anyone else?  I'm very polite and nice.  That's it.  You see the Knicks last night?  No, I did not.  I'm not really watching right now.  Go, we're pals!  When he comes in, as he does the voice,  Mars tries to talk to me. 
[00:38:30]  I'm very cordial and nice, but it's just too early.  Gossipy Gertie.  See, at least Mars has been here for like eight or nine years or whatever.  And has never pretended to be your friend.  He's always said, I very much want to be Opie's friend.  He's tried.  But every once in a while, I go, I think we're to the point where, you know, we can exchange numbers.  I'm like, no, not yet.  Not yet.  Keep working on it, Mars.  Keep working.  Not yet.  You've gone through numbers since he's been trying.  So why no girl in a year? 
[00:39:00]  I've found that I really, you know...  Are you a little funny?  A little funny?  There's three reasons.  Are you a little funny?  Fear, queer, or career?  Why ain't you going out?  It's not career.  No, I just, I prefer being with...  But it's all right if you're a little funny.  You're in a safe place here.  Are you a little funny?  Multiple.  I'm not saying all at the same time.  I just like going from one to another to another.  Hey!  Whoa!  Look at that.  Well, me and Anthony at Pals, we talk about chicks. 
[00:39:30]  Whoa, heck.  I'm just being honest with you guys.  Watch out.  Giving that a try, are you?  Honesty?  Wow.  So you just kind of like plugging different girls.  You don't like being committed to one.  Well, no, I was with this chick for a very, very long time.  Can I ask you something?  Do you plow them?  Ah, yeah!  You give them a good plowing Brooklyn style.  Yeah!  Do you eat ass?  No, I've actually never done it.  Oh, man.  I mean, yeah, give it a try. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, God.  Oh, that mustache just rubbing against her anus.  But, yeah.  When was the last time you were with a girl in the biblical sense?  Maybe about two weeks ago, maybe.  Oh!  Do tell!  Do tell!  Was it in Brooklyn?  Did it end with you sitting on the end of the bed trying to explain what happened?  Like, no, it usually works.  It was happening somewhere, but...  Um, yeah, no.  The hum of the posty vac on the night table. 
[00:40:30]  It was what?  What?  What'd you say?  It was, uh, it was fun.  You're a liar!  Oh, Jesus.  How do you go about picking up a girl?  How does Sal make the move?  Um, I don't know.  I usually like to meet, like, at least have some sort of, like, a mutual friend, you know?  So it's not, like, completely out of the normal.  God damn liar!  So you have a mutual friend, and, well, let's take this last girl from two weeks ago as  an example.  How did you even meet her? 
[00:41:00]  How, Sal?  Uh, I thought you were being honest.  It's not a difficult question.  It's two weeks ago.  You gotta remember, it's getting laid.  It's still something pretty cool in a guy's life.  Unless there is no girl.  Oh, shit.  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  Alright.  No, no, no.  Yeah, yeah.  How did you meet her?  Okay, he's getting a pen.  Uh-oh.  Oh, he has to be careful.  Oh, shit!  He's writing down.  He's writing down.  He's writing down.  He's writing down.  He's writing down.  You gotta be careful.  Well, I grew up with her.  Oh, he wrote work.  Fucking Sam!  He barely even got the K written. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, okay.  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  Shenanigans!  Alright, so...  Now, was she an intern?  No.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh!  Of shade?  Wow.  No, no, no, no, no.  Good.  Okay, I like that reaction.  You actually went out with her, or did you have a 10-second conversation?  With her, and now you're misrepresenting her.  No, we never dated her or anything.  Initials.  J, C.  Wait, you never dated, so what happened?  You just plowed her?  Yeah, we just, you know, messed around.  He doesn't date, he plowed. 
[00:42:00]  Wait, messed around.  Did you fuck her, or did you just fool around?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Did you wear a bag?  I got...  I got...  Over his head.  I did.  I got a...  I got a...  I got a thousand dollars, if he could prove this.  Whoa!  Whoa!  A cool G, motherfucker!  One thousand dollars.  A thousand...  Wow.  Alright.  Wait a minute.  Uh-oh, he's coming over.  He's ready for the handshake.  Where is this?  You might have just pushed all in, and you're getting called.  He just wants to shake hands with you.  That's all it is.  That's true.  Me and Opie shake hands. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  We talk about chicks.  Press security.  He fucking gives me cash when I need it.  That's right.  So this girl's willing to come in here and say that, yes, she had sex with you.  You plowed her.  For 500 bucks.  You took your...  I was just thinking that, yeah.  You know.  I'll admit, I jerked you off for 250.  Exactly.  I highly...  Oh, no.  Oh, 15 minutes is up.  It's up.  That's okay.  Yours is.  What's the 15 minutes up?  You want to traipse down there and see if you want to see it?  Why don't you gallivet down there and see if you want to see it? 
[00:43:00]  Yeah.  Try not to fuck any girls on the way out.  Yeah.  Jesus.  I'm not saying I'm like a playboy or anything.  Whoa.  Whoa.  You're modest.  I understand.  Could you get to Gary and back with that giant dick without it falling out of your trousers?  Plowing some girls here at work?  How many times did you fuck her?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Maybe.  Sure you do.  I should take this.  Every pump doesn't mean, like, you're fucked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  I fucked her like, one, two, three.  Ten times, yeah.  Ten times, yeah.  But if it's proven you didn't, something has to happen to you. 
[00:43:30]  What would she look like as far as a number-wise on the scale of girl?  You know that.  Zero to ten.  Nine?  A nine.  You fucked a nine.  There's no nines that work here.  A nine here?  Are you crazy?  Yeah.  Let me ask you a question.  Oh.  Has she been here longer than you or the same amount of time?  Is her IQ or her age?  Mars is pacing outside the studio.  Mars. 
[00:44:00]  Mars is like a fucking...  You don't believe this, kid.  It's a fucking nine.  A nine at Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Uh-oh.  Are you...  I wrote down where I know she works.  Was the girl maybe having a problem with her marriage at the time?  No, no, no, no, no.  Does she have giant feet?  Can you see that?  I don't want to...  I didn't write it, too.  I just passed that down.  I wrote it really small, just so I...  Oh, yeah.  You see it?  Yeah.  You see it?  That's what I think.  They got a couple lookers, but... 
[00:44:30]  Mars, do you think that he had sex with an employee here at Sirius XM?  That was a nine.  No, no.  Definitely not a nine, but he possibly had a four or a three.  What?  Oh, wow.  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  No.  That's a big fucking disparity.  Why did she go lunch a banger again?  Yeah.  We did.  We were for a while.  Oh, shit.  Oh, you were hanging out more than one.  Yeah.  Now it's all...  It's all...  We're not done anymore.  Why doesn't Sam know about this?  Sam, you know everything around this.  Sam knows everything that goes on.  I'm going to say something. 
[00:45:00]  I'm going to say something.  Yes.  Don't take the bet.  Really?  Oh!  I was about to take the bet.  I'll do it.  I know everything that goes around these.  Wow.  Wow.  So this went down.  Yes, this is true.  Fuck, man.  I want to know who this was, though.  You just saved me a thousand.  That's pretty good.  What do I owe you now, you fuck?  Well, we just got to talk about your fee.  Dude, I was about to take the bet.  You just saved me a thousand.  So can I get five hundred?  I was working it out of my head.  He wouldn't have been on a prove it, though.  She wouldn't have been on the...  Is the girl hot? 
[00:45:30]  Yes.  Is there a picture anywhere that I could see?  Let me see.  All right.  Go ahead.  Because I want to see who this is.  And we can't...  I won't say...  I'm not going to reveal it.  I'll be good.  I'll be good.  Shut up, Sal.  I know what I'm doing.  Oh, you trust us?  Thank you.  Oh, Jesus.  Don't worry, Opie.  Can I try right?  Sal, Sal, Sal.  No?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Are you with this woman anymore?  No, no, no, no.  How'd it go bad?  Oh.  Just, you know.  What happened?  Had a discussion and...  She was yawning.  Yeah, that's pretty much it. 
[00:46:00]  She was yawning.  All right.  Let me see.  Come on.  Who is this bitch?  Let's see.  Let's see a photo.  Come on.  Give me a pic.  Which one?  This one.  No way.  Wow.  Let me see.  Really?  Dude, get the fuck out.  Really?  Give me another pic.  Oh, okay.  Give me another pic.  Yeah, you've seen her.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's cute.  She's sexy, actually.  I'm trying to figure out...  You've absolutely seen her?  Yeah, yeah.  I know she is.  Where I...  Oh.  Well, that's a bad picture.  I mean, she's...  Yeah, she's hot. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah, I'm trying to get it.  Does she shave her vagina?  Yes.  Nice.  They all do, Jimmy.  She stays in the same age.  I don't know.  Is it nice?  Stay in age.  Which one?  On the left.  Oh, okay.  Left?  Yeah, I probably have...  Let's see.  You have, definitely.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Is it a giant pussy or no?  Oh, just like...  Literally giant.  I know what...  Yeah, you...  No, it's not what you...  Fuck.  They saved me a thousand bucks.  Yeah.  But that means...  Yeah, I got one more pic.  Let's find something like sexy.  Bikini shot or some shit.  Girls love posting pictures of them at the beach. 
[00:47:00]  Yeah.  Hmm.  I want to ask respectful questions.  What does she do here?  Write down what she does here.  I have no idea.  Besides fuck guys who can't help her.  Yeah, really?  What a fucking...  That's pretty dumb to put to...  I believe penis in her.  We've had her...  Really?  We've had her on the beach.  I don't know if she's ever been on, but I...  Oh!  I spoke to her once in the hall, but I don't think she's ever been on there.  Yeah?  She made a bad choice, though.  She could have eaten my ass once.  I would have skipped all the way down to Scott's office.  She's terrific. 
[00:47:30]  Give her a raise.  She's terrific.  She's terrific.  Oh, shit.  Oh, really?  Oh, yes, she is.  Oh, okay.  Now that makes sense.  Of course.  How do you know that?  I know everything.  Sam does know everything.  Did you guys 69?  No.  Sam saved me a thousand bucks.  That's for real.  That is pretty good.  You should give him 10%.  I was about to take it.  You should give him a 10% fee.  Because he came over way too quickly with the handshake to make the bed official.  No, we didn't.  She blow you?  Yes. 
[00:48:00]  Nice.  Hey, what about any others from here?  Where'd you come?  Is that your first SiriusXM conquest?  This is the first one.  And the last, now that you're talking about it.  Yeah, exactly.  None of these girls are going to tell you a lot.  I'm completely done with this now.  Yeah, you won't have to put up with that again.  So we just gave you a good excuse.  Where'd you come?  All right, let's see.  Whoa.  Coming right up?  Nice tits.  I like your line of questioning, Jim.  Where'd you come?  Where she wouldn't blow you?  This is the worst thing.  Jim is onto a great line of questioning.  I told you I know everything.  A great line of questioning.  What happened? 
[00:48:30]  So Sal had to tell you about it.  I think I know what happened.  I heard from multiple parties.  Whoa!  Did you hear from...  Yes.  You blew it in her yap and she was fucking bummed out?  She told you?  I have a lot of friends.  Why would she tell you about her sex place?  She's a fag hag, that's why.  Sam's here until the afternoon just working this whole place.  Sam is literally the minister of information.  For real, how much do I owe you for saving me a thousand?  I'd give him 10%.  Let's go 250.  Let's do 25.  50, 25%. 
[00:49:00]  Times are tough.  Times are tough.  For a fucking...  It's a downed economy, fiscal cliff.  But first of all, why didn't you blurt out...  When we were calling him a liar, why didn't you say, no, no, it's the truth right away  before he even said the bet?  Well, I wanted to see how it played out first.  I wouldn't have let him make that.  Radio.  So hold on now.  I almost made the bet.  When were you going to pop in?  That's true.  He ran over with his hands.  Really?  I wouldn't let you know.  You're shooting the rope at the last minute, motherfucker.  So she's blowing you, right?  All right.  I'll just say it. 
[00:49:30]  I'll just say it.  Okay.  Because this is only going to end bad.  I just couldn't come with her.  Okay.  Oh, no!  God, you're such an idiot.  I couldn't...  Listen, I'm just the dumbest fucking guy ever.  I'll say it.  You got everyone wondering about you, and you...  Oh, what an idiot.  That's fine.  I'll just say it.  I couldn't do it.  We're all wondering if you're a little funny.  I said it.  I'm honest with you guys.  But do you understand what just happened?  We're all wondering if you're a little funny.  Oh, my God.  Then you give us this amazing story where this girl is absolutely really hot, and then you 
[00:50:00]  fucking say that?  That's the beauty of it.  So now we're back to thinking you're funny.  Like, she's high up there.  You guys can think about it.  I'm completely honest with you.  I told...  Sam knows everything's up.  Did you tell Sam, or did she tell you that he couldn't come?  I found out from multiple times.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  What did she get?  What did she say?  She literally like, oh, and he couldn't even fucking come.  What an asshole.  It wasn't...  It took a few questions before that information.  How many times did you fool around with her?  How many times did I fuck her? 
[00:50:30]  Or anything.  Like, you couldn't come with her at all?  Ever?  Yeah, not once.  Okay.  I couldn't.  You know, I can't even look at him.  Dude, you know, you're...  Ew, was it that horrible thing that girls have on their chest?  You know, tits?  No, she's a fucking knockout.  Oh, was it?  Oh, yeah.  What if the pro-sexual guys would love her?  Her genitals are internal.  Oh, right.  I was like, where is this?  Ew.  I can't sword fight with this.  You were pushing the belly button, hoping the genitals would pop out?  You told me that was her carrying pouch for it? 
[00:51:00]  So wait, let me see.  I've had these before.  I'm not willing to give up on them yet.  You had everyone off the scent.  I'm being honest with you.  I'm telling you the truth.  Did you lose your ride while she was blowing you?  Um...  Oh, Jesus.  Well, you didn't get the answer to how many times.  How many times did you attempt to come and you weren't able to?  Yeah.  Maybe, like, you know, like six times?  Oh, God.  You had six separate instances where you were with her having sex.  Um...  Six separate, totally separate. 
[00:51:30]  Not twice in one night.  No, maybe not six.  Maybe, like, five or four.  All right, five, four, five, whatever.  Multiple, separate times.  Each time, progressively, you were like, oh, my God, I'm not coming again.  Yeah.  What didn't you like about her?  What turned you off?  Something, something.  Nothing.  Nothing, I just, I can't have sex with a fucking bag on.  It's just the worst.  I hate it.  No.  Okay, how about during the blowjob, though?  She didn't make you wear a bag during a blowjob.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  But it wasn't...  It was just kind of like a pre-sex.  So why didn't you just pull it off and jerk off while she lit your nipples? 
[00:52:00]  Uh, that was, I guess that was a possibility.  Not all of us are into nipple play, Jimmy.  Well, or whatever.  You want to kiss your stomach and you're involved.  I always found that creepy, the nipple play guy.  He's 22.  I hate when the fuck you get the tweak in and all I do.  At 22, with that girl, you should be able to have a mitten on your dick and be able  to come.  Especially the first time.  Yeah.  Number one, first time, you're all fucking wound up.  Or first six times.  Six times.  Oh, it's out there.  I told you guys the truth. 
[00:52:30]  That's...  But if I gotta say for Sal, I'll just step in.  Oh, no.  No, don't.  For a second.  Jimmy.  I've had those things where I could not blow loads with certain girls.  I used to fuck a girl who did porn and I could never come with her.  I remember not being able to come.  It was in the 80s when I was coked out of my fucking porn.  Shit.  No, sometimes you think you should be more turned on than you are.  Or after you did it five times.  Five times.  I finally went, I don't think I'm going to be able to come again.  I don't think I could get six in.  Jesus.  Sal, I don't know.  Yeah.  Whatever. 
[00:53:00]  I'm not...  Did she really turn you on?  Oh, yeah, dude.  Like, she's fucking...  She's a knockout.  No, but you're saying that.  You're saying that.  I understand that, but...  Jesus.  She's gorgeous.  Are you still...  I like her tits.  Are you starting to wonder what's wrong with you?  No, I'm...  Are you starting to wonder a little comfortable with who I am?  That's fine.  That's fine.  Especially in this day and age.  There's nothing wrong with it.  Military allows it.  No.  Sure.  Supreme courts get all out soon.  Yes.  Marriage all over the place.  All kinds of states.  Yeah.  Holy shit. 
[00:53:30]  Yeah.  I don't know, dude.  Look at that.  Let me see.  When she fucking first disrobes and you see her nudity in front of you, you were like,  Meh.  No.  Meh.  No, it wasn't like that at all.  You were right.  If you were turned on to the point, that shouldn't...  No, it went...  Yeah, yeah.  No, no, no.  So what would you do if you were sex and you wanted to stop?  Like, you'd fuck her for a little while.  Yeah, what'd you do?  And then how would you end it?  Like, how would you just pull out and go, all right. 
[00:54:00]  He went...  He pulled out and went, ta-da!  And then went home.  Um, no.  I guess we must have just been, like, tired out or whatever and just...  I want to get to Sam Roberts here for a second.  During your discussion with other parties...  Yes.  ...did she talk about how she felt during this whole thing?  Uh...  Oh, yeah.  She told you something.  Oh.  What did she tell me?  Well, say what you were going to say.  I don't know what you were going to say.  What did she tell me?  Oh, oh, oh.  What did she tell me?  I don't know.  Maybe...  You just said she told you something.  What did she tell me? 
[00:54:30]  No, what were you going to say?  You say what you were going to say first.  Ant didn't even finish this question.  What did she tell me, Sal?  What did she tell you, Sal?  Well, she told you everything, so...  No, specifically, what did you just bring up?  Comment, Sal?  Comment.  Was that I had the...  This is going to be...  This is going to be...  The hip?  I have.  That I had the biggest dick she's ever seen.  Whoa!  She told me she told you.  Why would I...  Are you just bragging?  I'm not trying to brag.  Well, Anthony, before you go any further... 
[00:55:00]  Ew.  And that's not saying much.  I don't think she's been with many people.  What are you packing?  What do you got, an eight and a half?  No.  He just wanted to brag about it.  I know.  What the fuck's that about?  What were you going to say now?  Her past exploits were Wang Cha, Fang Wa, and Hing Chu.  Well, you've got to have at least eight.  I don't think I have a...  I mean, I'm assuming if she's a healthy...  I've got to be careful here, because she works here.  Measured from the tailbone.  A healthy girl, she's probably seen a few at this point, 
[00:55:30]  so if she's saying yours is the biggest,  it's got to be at least, what, eight?  At least?  I really don't think I have an eight-inch dick, but...  Maybe he's probably...  You know what it is?  He might have six and three quarters of some girth.  He probably has a tapering penis.  Like, it's big at the bottom, and it just tapers into a humiliating...  She used to work at the McMartin Preschool.  He's got a giant cock.  She installs diaper-changing stations in the rest area on her side job.  All right.  Was that what you were trying to ask me? 
[00:56:00]  No!  I was going to try to ask, was she...  Now, you can have a big dick and be one lousy fuck.  Probably exactly what I was.  Was she satisfied?  Was she satisfied?  She was extraordinarily disappointed that he didn't achieve climax,  and felt that it was her fault.  Undesirable.  Right.  Undesirable.  It's an insult to a girl's vagina.  What did she not do that you needed?  There's something she wasn't doing that he needed. 
[00:56:30]  This is going with...  Talking football.  Okay.  I like to...  I like a little ass play.  That's pretty much it.  Oh!  Jesus.  Oh!  Let's go with that!  You couldn't...  You couldn't come with a hot chick.  With a girl, though.  Oh, fair enough.  Oh, my God.  He doesn't know, right?  No, no, no.  He has no idea.  He's innocent.  You gave it to her, and she's like, how about strapping that on her? 
[00:57:00]  No!  He likes a little ass play.  Morris is losing his mind.  He can't believe it.  He can't believe it.  Oh, my God.  I like, you know, touching a girl's ass a little bit.  You know.  Wait, touching a girl's ass?  She wouldn't let you play with her asshole?  What happened there?  Not really, no.  What did she do?  She told me no.  Was it swampy?  No, it was fantastic.  Wait, what was your move?  What were you doing?  Yeah, I was doing a little, you know...  Wait, you want...  You didn't want the pussy?  No, I did.  Oh, boy.  No, you didn't.  So, wait, wait, wait.  I need to know the exact circumstance, position-wise. 
[00:57:30]  I need, like, an accident diagram of what the fuck happened where you went for her ass.  Would you go with the one finger?  Did you go with your fist with lard on it?  What the fuck were you doing?  Did you put, like, Caligula first and say, wait, wait, watch this part.  You're going to love this.  No, I was, you know, touching her.  Okay.  And one time she was like, oh, you're getting too close to, you know.  And I was like, okay, so...  How'd she refer to it?  How'd she say it?  How'd she say it?  She actually said you're getting too close to? 
[00:58:00]  Too close.  Yeah, she was like, you're getting...  So I was like, okay.  You're getting too close to where the shit comes out.  Jimmy's going completely on fucking Sal's side now.  Yeah.  Really?  Going with the disclaimer, with the precursor that he really was attracted to her as a woman  sexually and that he's not good.  If that's true, she just didn't turn him on.  How old is this girl, by the way?  Um...  She's young.  Yeah.  Yeah, she's younger.  She's younger than me.  Older than Sal, but younger than me.  26, 27, I would guess. 
[00:58:30]  I'm 29.  She's younger than 29.  You're pushing 30.  Like, my ex-girlfriend, one of my favorite things to do.  Like, okay, I'll just be honest again.  If she was on top, I'd love to, like, you know, touch her ass.  Oh, so she's on top.  Yeah.  And, you know, you reach around the back, you grab the ass a little.  You grab ass.  And then you stick a little finger.  And a little, little, little, little happens.  You know what I'm talking about.  All right.  And that makes me lose my fucking mind.  Oh!  So, but...  All right.  But the other stuff doesn't...  We all have our shit that makes us lose our minds, but... 
[00:59:00]  I mean, that's good.  The basic shit should make you lose your mind, too.  And at 22, you've been with one girl for, like, a long time.  You're getting out of it.  You're starting to play the field again.  It's only been a few months.  Look out.  There's no way your appetites are that specific yet.  Like, Jim has specific appetites because he's had a lot.  Stop trying to make it into something.  But no, Sam raises a good point there, too, though.  Stop trying to make it into something.  No, no, no, no.  Look, if fucking...  Put it this way.  If there's a wonderful buffet set up, but they're out of chicken wings, I'm still going 
[00:59:30]  to eat.  You're going to eat, yeah.  I'm going to get full.  You're fucking there.  Without the ass play, there's still plenty other shit to do.  Plenty other things to do.  Because you're a chicken hawk.  He likes the tender ones.  I think that the reality was, it's my opinion, is that she just didn't turn him on like he  thought she should have.  He's probably like what's wrong with me.  Not sexually compatible?  That happens a lot.  Like, if you see a girl who's pretty, and she's pretty, and you'll go, why am I not turned  on by this?  I think it's a lot deeper than that.  I think you're letting him off the floor. 
[01:00:00]  You went down on her?  No, but I don't think you was turned on by her.  How far down did you go?  Did you start a little ass?  Like, was your tongue venturing where she was getting upset?  No, no, no.  It was just, yeah, I was just touching her.  So, like, even that alone, I was like, well, then if I can't even touch you there, then,  you know.  If someone, do you like to fucking hear?  Don't touch me there!  Should have been playing that song, Iraq.  The girl we're talking about is extremely sexy.  She's very.  Yeah, that's what I said.  I think she's a nine.  So she's younger than Sam, which makes her 18 or fucking 40. 
[01:00:30]  Something like that.  I don't know.  You're a 20s.  You really didn't zero it.  When you said younger than me, you're 29.  That includes all the 20s.  Older than Sal, but younger than me.  But somewhere.  Like 25-ish.  Ah, top.  I completely think she's a nine still.  I don't take, I don't rescind that at all.  That last digit is for ass play.  That 10.  She'd have been a 10 if she would have accepted your fucking finger.  Plus there's pressure.  It's a workplace relationship.  It's like one of those things where.  Yeah, and guess who was a, you know. 
[01:01:00]  Wow, why are you letting him off the hook?  Because I did a part of it that I believe.  No, no, no.  But all that stuff, that's not in play here.  I think that he's.  This kid is confused about his sexuality.  Oh, I don't even disagree with you.  Someone's got to say it.  I don't disagree with you.  And now you're letting him off the hook.  This girl is gorgeous.  No, but that doesn't.  I'm not letting him off the hook.  Because I think they all tie in together.  I think they're all part of the same thing.  I think that he thought he should have been more attracted to her than he was.  Right.  And she wasn't turning him on.  He doesn't know how to process that yet because he's young and just go, you know what?  This isn't turning me on. 
[01:01:30]  It's like, why is this not turning me on?  What the fuck is wrong with me?  I should be feeling a certain way.  Then she does something which is, well, don't touch my asshole.  Aha!  That's why.  See?  Because she wouldn't let me touch her asshole.  Right.  And if it was that, if she would let me touch the asshole, it would be something else.  Jimmy put it all out there.  I couldn't agree more.  Oh.  The previous girl I was with prior to this one?  Do you like the word fabulous?  No.  Come on.  I just wonder.  I just wonder.  In ten years, I think that we will all know Sal as an out gay man.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not the case.  Oh, he's gay. 
[01:02:00]  How many of your friends are named Barry?  Oh.  Not any friends.  None.  I don't know.  All right.  Well, you know.  It's my opinion.  How did you go from just workplace to actually fucking her?  Um, it was, it was just like casual, casual, I guess, you know, chatting and stuff like  that.  And then one night I was like, oh, I'm in the city.  Let's, let's get a drink.  Why not?  So then we went to a club and, uh, started, you know. 
[01:02:30]  She's like, why am I the only girl here?  It's a place I come for a drink.  Shot of the white stuff, as I call it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Let's let him be.  All right.  That's fucking very interesting.  Go check on Gary, see if he's here.  I told you guys the truth.  Jimmy hit it on the head with, uh, the issues.  I don't know.  I'd find somewhere else to fucking, you know, focus my attention.  I think it's a tide.  Everything is tied into the same thing. 
[01:03:00]  I think he's being mostly honest.  Yeah.  I'm telling you, ask me any other question.  I'll be.  No, I think you're not being honest with yourself.  Yeah.  Do you feel like you might like guys?  No.  Oh.  Have you ever jerked off thinking about a threesome with you, a guy, and a girl?  No.  Oh, that was a lot.  That took a while.  I could instantly say no.  That was the Penn State thing.  Yeah.  All over again.  Well, I could, I never jerked off thinking of another guy in any way, shape, or form in  a sexual situation with me.  Ever.  No way.  Not fucking a chick or something? 
[01:03:30]  Wow.  No.  Like three-way porn where there's two guys.  I can't, I can't watch that show.  Yeah, because what the hell is she doing there, right?  You come so fast.  All right, Sal.  All righty, guys.  And thank you to Sam for saving me a thousand bucks.  Yeah, that was fucking key right there.  Saving you $7.50.  Oh, he wants that $2.50, man.  And he's going to fucking ask me every day now.  And he's checking on Gary.  Look at him sashaying down the hall.  What a fucking, what a queeb.  He doesn't sashay, but I don't know.  He really has very feminine tendencies. 
[01:04:00]  With what's in the front of his brain.  Yes.  Not what's deep and buried.  Now it's set back there.  The stuff he has to push back all the time.  He's not conscious of it.  No.  Because when you're not attracted to somebody, though, like I've had hot girls, and I'm  like, I should be more, like, I'm so weird.  Like, there's certain girls I've been, I'm like, this is not turning me on.  You're very fucking, you are the last thing to set as the fucking standard.  No, no, no.  To think like, well, if Jimmy thinks like that.  But I understand that, like.  Because they're hot.  You're a twisted, sick man.  It's hard to say, you know what? 
[01:04:30]  She's cute, pretty girl, but she didn't turn me on sexually.  I guess he's here.  Hmm.  Wow.  He's here.  He's queer.  He's fabulous.  Get used to us.  We're here.  Looks like somebody won the big bet.  So if Gary's here, why doesn't he walk down the hall, come on air, to give us a studio?  Off air, Opie.  It ain't happening off air, I'm telling you right now.  Off air.  You've seen her.  One more picture of her.  You've seen her.  I know.  I don't pay attention to anyone around here.  I believe she was on the show.  What?  I'm almost positive. 
[01:05:00]  Who let?  Who let?  And she was turned off by all our ages.  I remember this one.  Oh, that's her?  Yeah.  She laughed at us when she started doing the math in her head.  Oh, so she gets a fucking young buck who can't even fucking cum.  Nice.  I believe.  Nice.  To make her feel like shit.  To make her feel unwomanly and unattractive.  What?  You'd cum?  Fucking cum in a second.  Well, that doesn't sound good.  Greater.  In a second.  All right. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah, she's got that nice white trash look.  Yeah, great body.  I don't think she looks like white trash.  Get the fuck out of here.  All right, we've got a break.  Because we've got to get into the Alex Jones and Piers Morgan thing.  Holy fuck.  I didn't see the audio.  Great TV.  Also, Al Roker shitting himself at the White House.  I never thought I'd like Al Roker.  Yeah.  That's fantastic.  He's calling it a shart.  Oh.  He even used the term shart. 
[01:06:00]  He's disgusting.  And another Gary update, I think.  Ooh.  Yeah, the listeners turned me on to something.  And I want to see.  Oh, no.  I might have an update.  Love a ringer.  Grr.  The O.P.  Anthony Channel.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  On Sirius XM.  You might think you can sing.  Ooh.  But you're wrong.  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp.  Got a smoke wave.  And learn to sing like a champ.  Who's making love with my old lady while I'm out making love. 
[01:06:30]  Joe doesn't just teach you to sing the classics.  He beats the awful right out of you.  When a man loves a woman.  Words is the most important thing, too.  Let's say songs.  Because sometimes, you know, you...  After a few short weeks with Joe's unique approach to vocal training, you'll be belting out tune just like Smokin' Joe belted Muhammad Ali.  Ooh.  Or you'll have brain damage. 
[01:07:00]  Ah.  Spend two amazing weeks in Joe Frazier's 700-square-foot apartment above his Philadelphia boxing gym.  And floor your friends with your amazing vocal chops.  Joe might have high blood pressure, diabetes, and needs to carry a cane to stand upright.  But his magical voice will bring you to tears.  Mustang selling now, baby.  Oh, yeah.  Think you better slow than Mustang down.  And if that doesn't, his left hook will.  You'll be hitting the high notes faster than Joe Frazier hits the canvas. 
[01:07:30]  Come to Joe Frazier's karaoke camp, where our motto is...  Me, you ain't used these as you better.  It's all.  Attention anglers.  Still convinced that fishing is a sport?  Well, renowned sportsman James Norton presents the ultimate cure for your delusion.  How smart do you have to be to beat this animal psychologically?  What a dumb animal the fish is.  Introducing, fishing is not a sport, you douche.  It's not a sport.  It's not a sport. 
[01:08:00]  Go in the water with your fists and punch the fish.  That's a sport.  You're standing in a fucking boat.  It's not a sport.  You have a hook and the fish has nothing but hunger.  This collection is presented on nine full-length high-fidelity audio cassettes  and will thoroughly convince you that your leisure activity is a colossal waste of time.  You and some other jizz bucket and fucking waders  and a big gut standing there in 10-degree water  drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon trying to hook some asshole fish.  You're not a sportsman.  You're not out there sporting.  Despite what you may think, fishing is not a battle of wits. 
[01:08:30]  It's not stacked equally between a dumb fucking fish  who has been doing the same thing since dinosaurs were shitting all over Manhattan.  Do you understand?  That fish was no smarter when a tyrannosaurus was shitting on 70th Street and Broadway.  Put down that stupid fishing pole and pick up your copies of Fishing is Not a Sport,  you douche.  Narrated by James Norton.  I'm just letting you know, you're not a sportsman.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I'd like to say fuck you to my little dick, you asshole.  Stop pissing on my balls.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, fuck you goes out to all you assholes with your outrageous stories  on what you're trying to do.  I was trying to jerk off.  I was trying to fuck my husband.  I was trying to fuck a hamster.  You were not.  Shut up.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Yeah, I want to say fuck you to AIDS. 
[01:09:30]  Because of you, you cop sucker, I have to make my dick look like a tiny bank robber  whenever I want to sex up my woman.  Fuck you, AIDS.  Fuck you.  That S.F.U. goes out to Sam, you need to shut the fuck up, dude.  Okay, you don't make yourself look good by making everybody, trying to make everybody else  look bad.  You're an asshole.  I can't stand you.  You make me sick, always putting somebody else down to try to make yourself look good. 
[01:10:00]  Shut the fuck up.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give a big F.U. to fucking Beer.  Fuck you, Beer.  I slept with a fat bitch last weekend, and now she's stalking me.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to give that fucking sick cunt of a cop who just pulled me over for going five  miles over the seas like this, a big fuck you.  So guess what, you sick?  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  I'd like to send a big F.U. out to fucking Sam for always saying, yeah, I mean, I just 
[01:10:30]  listened to the goddamn replay, and you fucking said, yeah, I mean, ten times within two minutes.  Holy fucking shit, dude.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You're cool, and fuck you.  Fuck you.  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-F-U-LINE-1.  That's 866-F-U-LINE-1. 
[01:11:00]  Sirius XM.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Oh, I don't know.  All right.  I got a surprise update.  I think my peeps are onto something.  Peeps?  Yeah.  Don't worry.  I'm going to not use the word peeps anymore.  I just heard how that sounded. 
[01:11:30]  It sounded awful.  Anyway, some people on Twitter got a hold of me yesterday afternoon.  Tweeter.  Who in this room right now wants a spinning wheel update?  Spinning wheel.  Round and roll.  Sam, what's the spinning wheel all about?  For the people that weren't listening yesterday.  We wanted to find out what was the latest video put up on the O.B. and Anthony page on Sirius XM.  Yes.  And we couldn't even check the video section. 
[01:12:00]  All we saw was a spinning wheel.  Right.  Now.  Can we get a spinning wheel update?  We told the radio wizard this needs to be fixed.  What a perfect song for Sal.  Instead of just bitching about things, we give solutions.  So we bitched.  We said this is a problem.  So now go and fix it as the radio wizard.  Uh-huh.  Let's see if it's fixed.  Okay.  And it has to be said, in case it is fixed, that at around three or four in the afternoon 
[01:12:30]  yesterday, six hours after the fact, it was still a spinning wheel.  No spinning wheel for me.  Fuck!  Sorry.  Damn it!  Sorry.  It's working.  I took a chance there.  And Oliver Stone has now made it to the page.  Ha ha ha ha!  Why is that funny?  Because yesterday.  Because we called him out on that one too?  Yes.  Yeah.  Ha ha ha!  Indeed.  But the record has to show at three, four in the afternoon yesterday, it was still a spinning 
[01:13:00]  wheel.  Oh, well.  Oliver Stone made it.  He made it.  Who else is up there?  Quentin Tarantino and Louis C.K.  And Chris Rock.  Chris Rock.  And a lot of big stars.  Gary Oldman.  All right.  There are other people we interview that are a lot of fun.  Hmm?  Look, let's-  And lots of logs.  Whoa, slow down.  Baby steps.  If you got something up there, at least.  Did you find out about the wall during the break?  No, it's not.  Off the air?  No, he's going to challenge me. 
[01:13:30]  He's going to make this an off the air thing and it's not happening.  Oh.  It might have to be.  Why?  I don't know.  Why?  You just got an update?  I just think I know what might be happening from-  And it might be something-  It's a speculation?  That might have to be said off air.  Oh.  Are you speculating?  Yes, but-  What would have to be?  Well, I can't say it on air.  Off air.  Could you write it down?  I'm just rhetorical questioning myself.  It's too long.  I think-  Does it have something to do with Nashville? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, it does not.  I actually forgot that I was going there.  Believe me, Nashville has forgotten.  Trust me, I've seen the ticket counts.  Oh, Jiminy Cricket, Jiminy.  When are you coming back?  I don't know.  When more than ten people a show want to see me?  Fuckers.  Zanies.  Got to put on a country western outfit.  All right.  Well, let's talk about Alex Jones.  Oh, my God.  Alex Jones.  You know what?  Where do we begin?  I like the guy. 
[01:14:30]  He's fucking hilarious.  But I don't think he wants to be just hilarious.  No.  Joe Rogan digs Alex Jones, but even he admitted recently on our show that, you know.  Look, he's got his niche.  I think Alex Jones isn't as crazy as he comes off on the air, but he saw what makes him  successful.  I think we said-  And he runs with it.  Somewhere between 10 and 20% of what he says, it makes you think, like, oh.  But it's that 80 to 90%.  I'll say 80%.  Yeah.  80% you're like, holy fuck, dude.  This guy's batshit crazy. 
[01:15:00]  You've got to relax a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So anyway, he was on Piers Morgan last night.  This was some of the best TV I've seen in a long time.  He fucking wouldn't let Piers talk.  Finally shut that fucking limey cocksucker up.  Ah, I got to give a little credit to Piers Morgan.  Why?  You got to give him a little credit?  A little credit.  What did he do there, Robbie?  He didn't lose his mind.  Up in here?  Up in here?  He was very calm, cool, collected.  Yes.  And just let Alex Jones lose his fucking mind. 
[01:15:30]  Go off?  Yeah.  I think a lot of people would have lost their mind back to Alex Jones.  It's true.  Anyway, they were discussing, I guess, gun control.  And Alex Jones is the one trying to get Piers Morgan out of the country?  Yeah, he started the petition.  Yeah.  He was the one.  Okay.  Which has well over 100,000 signatures.  Well, apparently, Alex Jones was all wound up because on the flight going to be on the  Piers Morgan show, the TSA pulled him aside and gave him some shit.  For what reason?  Because he's Alex Jones. 
[01:16:00]  That's what he's saying.  And he's always against the TSA and all that happy horse shit.  And he said that people were being let through with their shoes on.  And he was then asked to remove his shoes.  And he brought up the fact that he said, hey, look, other people are going through.  And they said, no, it's just the elderly and young people.  He goes, no, I saw people in their 40s being let through with their shoes.  And they said, take the fucking shoes off or we're going to arrest you.  He was the problem.  Yeah.  He was the problem.  Because the people going through, the TSA has a thing you can apply for on a website  where you can be like a pre-check almost where I guess they do a tremendous security check 
[01:16:30]  on you.  It takes a while.  I've gone through a few times where you can go through with your shoes.  Your laptop can stay in your bag.  There's a certain line, a TSA cleared line.  It's like fly clear what that used to be.  Yep, yep, yep.  But that's creepy.  Well, that's how, wouldn't the terrorists know that shit and figure out the workaround?  There's a real secure, a background check before you get to the airport.  It's like a real background check.  Yeah, but then how about you went crazy in between the background check and your flight. 
[01:17:00]  Well, you're still getting checked, but you just can, little things like you can leave  your light jacket on and you can leave your shoes on like we used to before Richard Reed.  Yeah, okay.  Meh.  I don't know if I like that.  I kind of would like it.  They also said, oh, hi, Mr. Hello, Mr. Jones.  Like they knew who he was.  And then he said the biggest thing was when he went through the metal detector, he said  he went through, heard nothing, and then after he came out the other side, he heard  meh, and they were kind of chuckling and laughing like they set it off on purpose after he went 
[01:17:30]  through for further harassment of Alex Jones.  Like I said, 20% of what he says, I'll give him 20.  Now it's 20.  I'll give him the 20.  I'm going to be fair.  But the 80% is a little far-fetched.  He's got something going, though.  I watch his videos.  They're hilarious.  When he's got the handheld cam.  Like he doesn't set up a tripod and talk into the camera.  It's got to be handheld to have that gritty, like moving look.  And then at some point he gets out of his chair and steps right up to the camera and 
[01:18:00]  finishes like what he's saying.  Like it's very important.  Oh my God.  Were you here that day?  Because we did the...  Oh, okay.  You are.  Yeah.  Because then he dramatically stood up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And started pointing right at the camera and he was moving and the cameraman had to like get  out of his way.  Crazy.  So he was on with Piers Morgan.  And look, we could certainly argue, you know, gun control again.  No problem.  Everyone knows my stance.  This clip is just hilarious.  Yeah.  And I want to make sure that comes across without getting too serious here because it's just 
[01:18:30]  ridiculous.  Yeah.  Why don't we play it from where you're at?  I think we could play the whole thing.  I know you cut it up for us nice here, Sam, but I don't know.  It's just too damn good.  Supporters of gun rights and it's led to a petition on the White House official website,  no less.  It's entitled, no quote, Deport British citizen Piers Morgan for attacking Second Amendment.  Take a look.  More than 104,000 people have signed it so far.  And joining me now is one of the people behind the petition, Alex Jones.  He's host of the Alex Jones Show. 
[01:19:00]  Welcome to you.  Piers, thanks for having me.  Why do you want to deport me?  Well, we did it as a way to bring attention to the fact that we have all of these foreigners  and the Russian government, the official Chinese government, Mao said political power goes  out of the barrel of a gun.  He killed about 80 million people because he's the only guy that had the guns.  Pause.  Is that a real number?  80 million?  I don't know.  What, Mao?  Yeah.  I think so.  80 million.  A lot of fucking Chinese over there. 
[01:19:30]  And he barrels through so you can't even, he'll give you so many facts within 30 seconds  that you can't even keep up.  Well, facts or just numbers.  What he would present as his facts.  His style is tough.  Hey, Piers.  Because you want to stop him after every fact and ask a follow-up question.  But he knows that.  That's why he keeps plowing through.  Because then it sounds like he's giving you more than you can handle.  Right.  Instead of the fact that it's hard to be rude and just go, hold on!  Right.  So we did it to point out that this is globalism and the mega banks that control the planet 
[01:20:00]  and brag that they've taken over, in Bloomberg, AP, Reuters, you name it, brag that they're  going to get our guns as well.  They've taken everybody's guns but the Swiss and the American people.  And when they get our guns, they can have their world tyranny.  While the government buys 1.6 billion bullets, armored vehicles, tanks, helicopters, predator  drones armed, now in U.S. skies, being used to arrest people in North Dakota, the Second  Amendment isn't there for duck hunting. 
[01:20:30]  It's there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs.  Take the women in India.  Your piece earlier on CNN I was watching during Anderson Cooper's show didn't tell you that  the women of India have signed giant petitions to get firearms because the police can't and  won't protect them.  The answer is, hey, wait a minute, I have FBI crime statistics that come out a year late.  2011, 20 plus percent crime drop in the last nine years.  Real violent crime because more guns means less crime. 
[01:21:00]  Britain took the guns 15, 16 years ago, tripling of your overall violent crime.  True, we have a higher gun violence level, but overall mugging, stabbings, deaths, those  men raped that woman in India to death with an iron rod four feet long.  You can't ban the iron rods.  The guns, the iron rods, Pierce, didn't do it.  The tyrants did it.  Hitler took the guns.  Stalin took the guns.  Mao took the guns.  Fidel Castro took the guns.  Hugo Chavez took the guns. 
[01:21:30]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.  It doesn't matter how many lemons you get out there on the street begging for them to  have their guns taken.  We will not relinquish them.  Do you understand?  That's why you're going to fail, and the establishment knows, no matter how much propaganda, the Republic  will rise again when you attempt to take our guns.  My family in the Texas Revolution against Santa Ana, my family was at the core on both sides  starting that because Santa Ana came to take the guns at Gonzales, Texas.  Pierce, don't try what your ancestors did before. 
[01:22:00]  Why don't you come to America, I'll take you out shooting, you can become an American  and join the Republic.  He's a good talker, Alex.  Of course he is.  Fucking Alex.  It started off all kind of normal, man.  I like when he put his finger out and started yelling at Pierce.  Ah, the Republic!  You think Pierce just knows, though, like, this is really good, what he's doing right now?  Like, as a broadcaster, he knows, right?  For his show, he knows.  Pierce is a very, very smart broadcaster.  He's sitting there going, hold on, I got gold. 
[01:22:30]  I got gold.  He knows for the show.  Of course he knows.  That's funny.  You finished?  Yes, I am finished.  You will not take my life.  You can go through background checks to get guns.  How about Prozac?  You know the number one, oh, that's the big sponsor, isn't it?  Or that whole class of drugs.  Let me ask you a question.  Oh, whoa, got to cut that off, don't you?  Don't want to talk about the U.S. number one cause of death is suicide now  because they give people suicide mass murder pills.  Calm down.  Your answer is to get more than a psychologist to put more crazy people on drugs that make 
[01:23:00]  them kill people, Pierce.  Let's try and have a debate here.  Yeah.  Answer me this question.  I'm sick of the same old script here, bud.  It's fine, bud.  How many gun murders were there in America last year?  Do you know?  There were about 11,458, and about 74% of those were gang-related, gangbangers shooting  each other.  You get three and a half to four thousand.  That wasn't the case.  How many people died from infections in hospitals?  197,000.  If I may just ask you a question.  That's right, Alex.  How many gun murders were there in Britain last year? 
[01:23:30]  How many great white sharks kill people every year, but they're scared to swim?  Right.  How many gun murders were there in Britain last year?  A very low amount.  I already went over those statistics.  How many?  Do you know?  That was only a few hundred.  No, no.  How many gun murders?  I actually did pull up the statistics.  Here, let me pull them out right here.  I figured you'd do that.  Gun murders in Britain last year.  Oh, wait.  UK violent crime, capital of Europe, London Telegraph.  Here, let me give you more.  It's quite a simple question.  Let me give you more.  You're a very loud man.  That's the oldest Perry Mason tactic to ask me some little factoid.  It's not a little factoid.  I already said earlier, England has a lot lower gun crime rate because you took all the 
[01:24:00]  guns.  Let me try.  Exactly my point.  But you've got hordes of people burning down cities and beating old women's brains out every  day.  That's a ridiculous thing.  If they arrest people in England, if they defend themselves, that's on record.  My God, you've got a total police state.  Everybody's fleeing that country because you've had to flee here, bud.  Why don't you tell folks?  You've had to flee here, bud.  Go back just slightly.  Oh, is that hilarious?  Barely.  Just a little tick.  Who doesn't fucking love Alex Jones? 
[01:24:30]  He's hilarious.  I love it.  And I love the fact that he has a Hitler hairdo.  Yes.  Alex Jones has a haircut exactly like him.  Oh, yeah, he does.  Yeah.  He's very, very entertaining.  I think this is the part where he starts attacking peers.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Country.  Because you've had to flee here, bud.  Why don't you tell folks?  Yeah, you fled here.  Why don't you go back and face the charges for the hacking scandal?  Answer this question.  How many guns?  Why'd you get fired from the Daily Mirror for putting out fake stories? 
[01:25:00]  How many?  You're a hatchet man of the New World Order.  You're a hatchet man.  And I want to say this right here.  You think you're a tough guy?  Head me back with a boxing ring in here.  What?  And I'll wear red, white, and blue, and you can wear your Jolly Roger.  You know what?  Let's try again.  Jolly Ranchers.  How many gun murders were there?  Oh, you're going to ban your fist now?  In Britain last year.  How many chimpanzees can dance on the head of a pin?  I already went over those statistics.  Do you know the answer?  No, I don't.  You said hundreds.  It's very low.  You said hundreds.  Yes.  It's actually 35. 
[01:25:30]  Well, the point is you can...  Against 11,000.  Do you understand the difference between 11,000 and 35?  Yeah, England wants to ban knives now because tens of thousands are getting stabbed.  But do you understand the difference?  The knife doesn't kill people.  Do you understand?  The gun doesn't kill people.  Yes.  Listen, do you understand you're not going to pull on America's heartstrings?  They know your script.  Okay?  You're not going to get our guns.  By the way, you guys always say, we just want to take the semi-autos.  Okay?  And all this other stuff.  When semi-autos aren't even... 
[01:26:00]  Rifles aren't even used but in a fraction of the crimes, you can pull those numbers up.  Okay?  No, no, no.  Hold on.  Let me ask you one question.  Which weapon was predominantly used in the Aurora movie theater shooting?  Oh, stop.  An M4 AR-15 variant.  So it was a semi-automatic assault rifle.  Yes, again.  Okay.  But statistically, it's very, very low.  Can you pause this real quick?  Do you agree?  The only problem with Alex Jones is you've got to let him at least go back at you.  Like a little bit, even though it's being very entertaining.  It's great.  It's fun to hear.  He doesn't let you talk.  We've had him on the phone, and he did the same thing. 
[01:26:30]  You've got to kind of let people in there.  I've got to get my point out.  I'm just going to fucking ramble over you.  To have a fair debate, but he doesn't care about that.  He doesn't want a fair debate.  He wants to get his point across.  He doesn't give a fuck.  He's got a really good business.  I'm sure he'll plug InfoWars and all that.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm writing down some of my favorites so far.  Oh, okay.  So far, I've got globalism.  Globalization.  Globalism.  Weird tyranny.  Ah.  Tyrannical governments. 
[01:27:00]  Yes.  My favorite, though, is the next two.  Suicide Mass Murder Pills.  Where do you get those?  And Hatchet Man of the New World Order.  You're a hatchet man of the New World Order.  If there was some kind of rock festival, I'd see these bands.  I'd go see Suicide Mass Murder Pills.  That's a fucking band list.  That's the second stage?  Where is that?  I think it is the second stage.  At Lollapalooza this summer.  Continue.  Single biggest shooting in the history of America in terms of people hit by a shooter. 
[01:27:30]  Do you know that?  No, I believe that there were others.  There's been some other shootings of about over 30.  No, no.  This was the single biggest mass shooting.  Listen, you're just going...  There have been bombings of Wall Street.  Let me ask you a second question.  Are we going to...  Listen, why can't the pilots have firearms?  We trust them to fly the planes.  You've had a lot to say.  No, my point is the Second Amendment is sacrosanct and you're not getting it.  Do you know which weapon was used in the Oregon shopping mall mass shooting recently? 
[01:28:00]  I understand that people who are mentally ill on all the serotonin reintake inhibitors  who play these shoot-em-up games want to go out and do this.  Because there's criminals, I don't lose my rights, Pierce.  Because there's criminals, I don't lose my rights.  Just answer the question.  Do you know what the weapon used was?  Listen, let me ask you a question.  I've got the FBI statistics that...  Listen, that the so-called semi-autos that you talk about...  Let's take a break.  Let me come back.  Again, you're not going to get our guns.  When we come back, try and answer my question.  Yeah, all you're going to do is sit there and play little factoid questions. 
[01:28:30]  Overall crime has gone on over 20%.  I know why Alex Jones doesn't want to get into that discussion.  Because it is one of these things the media does and Pierce does.  Oh, you get the fact that a rifle is used like that, an assault rifle is used in a mass killing.  But statistically, it's so low, it barely registers.  He should...  But he has the point...  He's making those points. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  But he should, like, let him get in a little bit.  And then...  Because it looks better if you allow him to make his point and then counter it with something like that.  It looks...  Because he has...  He definitely knows...  Hit him with the knowledge.  Yeah, he's not a dumb guy, Alex.  He has a great argument.  He's got a Nugent-type argument.  Take some of the energy out of your delivery and just hit him with the knowledge.  Pierce's whole point is, you know, trying to get him to admit that semi-automatic rifles are a much better way to kill more people than any other weapon.  It's true.  Sure.  Yes. 
[01:29:30]  But just because that's true doesn't mean you have to give up your right to own one.  Also true.  Yeah, I agree.  You know, like we brought up in the past a lot of times, there's plenty of other things that have killed many, many more people than guns on the whole.  And as far as rifles go, that's really just...  It's...  I'm sure the people that have been killed or know people that have been killed by these rifles don't want to hear it.  But the truth of the matter is, just based on statistics and not emotion, it's a very small fucking number. 
[01:30:00]  And like he said, the gang violence that is going on in this country is the majority, the large majority of the gun violence.  He said 74%.  Is that true?  Yes!  It's crazy!  But is he against mental health checks for buying a gun?  I don't think so.  Okay.  I thought he said something about mental health checks.  But a lot of states already have that in place.  Whether you want to do it in federal or get state rights.  I don't know, but why don't they then all allow me to go in and fucking go from state to state?  I'm not allowed to.  State rights, as far as the Second Amendment goes, it's all about states' rights. 
[01:30:30]  They have the ability...  And cities' rights to curtail firearm ownership.  It's amazing.  But to have a single restriction over people buying guns federally, I don't think you're going to see that.  Because a lot of states that don't have any regulation don't want regulation.  It's their right.  See, to me, though, their right to not have regulation infringes on other people's right to safe existence.  I think that if you have some kind of regulations and some kind of fucking background check, any state without a mental health check on people buying guns is simply a disgusting, irresponsible... 
[01:31:00]  We've heard about the mental health check thing.  It's the criteria for a mental health check is impossible.  What is a mental health check?  Where's the line between this person was feeling a bit melancholy today and clinical depression?  Where do you judge when someone's allowed to have a gun based on their mental state or not allowed to have one? 
[01:31:30]  Who's the one that tells you that that's what it is?  A doctor is now involved in getting a gun?  I don't understand how you would do this.  Well, the people who are for gun control are typically against having a mental health database, which gun advocates argue they don't even want a mental health database, which I think there should be one.  Would you want a mental health database that is open to the public just for guns, or then all of a sudden employers are able to look in?  How about this fucking website that opened up that showed people that own guns in Putnam County? 
[01:32:00]  They actually had a list of little buttons that was like, this guy owns a gun, this guy owns a gun.  Now you want your mental health records to be available to the public so that they could shun you from having a job or having kids or adopting or whatever.  No, but the option, there has to be a way to do it.  First of all, medical records are not public.  They're not public.  Of course not.  But then if you add them to a gun ownership thing, they would become public record, just as my pistol permit is public record. 
[01:32:30]  My address is up there.  Someone could look it up based sheerly on the fact that I own a gun.  You're a guy who I would be okay with owning, honestly.  As crazy as you are.  Because I think you would meet the responsibility.  But people who wouldn't meet that, fuck them.  I don't want them owning.  That's the criteria.  That's the hardest part.  Well, let me ask you this.  The kid in Aurora, would he have passed a mental check?  I don't think so.  I don't know. 
[01:33:00]  I don't think so.  But again, a mental check, what does that mean?  Well, I'm just, yeah, how would they have gone about it is what I'm asking.  What's the criteria?  I don't know if we have one yet.  The point is we all know a lot of crazy people in our own lives.  A lot of crazy people.  Or just a basic, like a weirdo.  You know a weirdo?  Yeah.  That doesn't mean he's going to shoot up a theater, but does that fact that he's a little off, and it can't even be clinically diagnosed, but you know he's a little off, do you stop him from getting a gun?  Yes.  How?  I understand.  But like, how? 
[01:33:30]  I don't know how, but yes.  I would like that person not to have a gun.  Look, Jim, Jim, I would love if crazy people couldn't get guns.  I would love it.  But how?  What's the criteria?  It's a good question.  It's very difficult.  I don't have 100% the answer.  It's a gray area.  It doesn't mean that there's not an answer.  It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be some kind, I think that there should be a mental health, some sort of a national database for people who are truly, I mean, dangerously fucked up. 
[01:34:00]  Not people who have had moments of depression or.  But that's you saying that.  Yeah.  Now, if you have had moments of depression or anxiety or what have you.  I can't own a gun.  I'm not qualified to own a gun.  Qualified to own a kitten.  It's terrible.  I personally believe that I am not, I mean, legally I'm allowed, but I've been too suicidal or I've been too, too many anger issues.  Like, I firmly believe I should not ever own one.  Uh-huh.  Um, and I know that about myself. 
[01:34:30]  So I don't know what the criteria would be.  But that because, that doesn't mean that there can't be one.  It's complicated.  You're right.  It doesn't mean there can't be one.  But it's so subjective.  Mental health is a very subjective gray thing.  It is, but there are things that we all agree on.  Maybe not a lot, but there are certain people we all go, yeah, no.  Well, you know what?  I could do the same thing about criminals.  I could say that person is not a good upstanding member of society based solely on an opinion, a background of previous trouble. 
[01:35:00]  We do that already.  Felons cannot own guns.  So that's a start.  So maybe if you've had certain legal issues due to mental health, that puts you on that list.  So maybe that does not make a complete list.  Right.  But it's a partial list.  But as a society, we coddle the mental ill to begin with.  Yes, yes.  And their rights will be infringed upon just because of their mental health.  Completely protect them.  Yep.  Yep.  Completely. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah.  Can we go back to part two of this?  Please.  Alex Jones on Piers Morgan giving us some great TV last night.  Here's how this is going to work.  And it's entirely down to you.  I'm going to ask you some questions in the spirit of a proper debate.  And you've had a lot to say so far on the show.  A lot of it aimed at me.  It's just fine.  But I want you to try and answer the questions.  It's a proper debate.  OK, I'm not trying to trip you up.  No, it's not a debate.  You're running the show.  You bring in your victims up front.  Look, you got your little note cards.  I just gave you FBI statistics that violent crime and gun crime is down over 20%. 
[01:36:00]  Alex, let me just ask you this.  And you want to go to little factoids.  No, they're not little factoids.  Anybody can pull those up.  Listen, do you have a bodyguard?  Alex.  Why do you have bodyguards?  I don't have a bodyguard.  Yeah, I've seen you on the news with them.  Don't you want to protect your wife from hoodlums or you want to call the police?  Let me ask you this question.  Why does Dianne Feinstein tell 60 minutes that she plans to try to take Mr. and Mrs.  America's guns?  Stop talking over me.  You guys want to disarm all of America.  No, I don't.  Dianne Feinstein's bill does.  I don't.  Gun confiscation. 
[01:36:30]  No, let me clarify for you.  You don't seem to understand what is the other one.  First you register, then you confiscate.  It's always done the same.  Here's what the campaign on this show.  Well, here, give me your little cue cards and I'll answer your questions.  What was the weapon used at Sandy Hook?  I've already gone over that and already answered it for you.  We haven't talked about Sandy Hook.  No, again, it's a .223 M4.  Again, but statistically, they're using very low percentage of shooting, period.  But you guys, people wouldn't go swimming because the movie Jaws, even though great white  sharks kill five people a year.  You're trying to scare people. 
[01:37:00]  Let me say something.  There's no metal shark in the water.  The same type of weapon was used in the last three mass shooters.  And Hitler used semi-autos to kill people.  Why would you not?  And so did Mao.  Why would you?  Why is the government arming to the teeth against us?  Alex, I don't know.  What about Fast and Furious?  Alex.  Why do our government ship guns into Mexico?  Alex.  To blame the Second Amendment?  Let's have a debate.  A false flag?  Alex.  To blame the Second Amendment?  I get accused.  Why they blow a building down the street here in New York?  Alex, I get accused when I get you guys on of talking over you of being rude.  I'm trying to be civil, right?  You've got to try and answer some of the questions, right? 
[01:37:30]  Here's my issue for you.  Why do people need, civilians need an AR-15 type assault rifle?  Why do you need them?  I already said statistically they're using a very low amount of the crimes.  That's an FBI fact show to you.  They've been using the last three mass shootings.  Yes.  Why do people need them?  I'll tell you why.  Because they advertise it in the media.  Anybody knows that if somebody jumps off the Empire State Building, they put cops up there  the next day because copycats come to do it again.  The media hypes and hypes and hypes.  And that's all the questions.  Don't just commit suicide.  Why do people need them?  Don't commit suicide by killing a bunch of kids. 
[01:38:00]  And here's the gun to use because it's the one the U.S. Army uses.  Why do people need them?  That's a great point.  They need them to protect us from the number one killer in history.  Government in the 20th century university study out of Hawaii killed 292 million people.  It's called democide.  Google it, folks.  Do you believe everyone in America?  Should everyone in America therefore have an AR-15 if they want one?  Statistically, where there's more guns, there's lower crime.  The highest crime is in Bloomberg.  But you have the most guns of any of the 23 richest countries in the world. 
[01:38:30]  And you have 21,000 gun motors a year.  Well, America was born on guns and whiskey.  It's true we're a violent society.  But statistically, knives kill three times more.  Have you seen the FBI numbers?  Knives, bats, rocks kill, kill, kill, kill, mini-missive transport.  Alex, for someone that does not trust the government at all and has zero faith in the government's  ability to tell the truth, he sure has faith in the FBI statistics. 
[01:39:00]  Wow, Jimmy, that's good.  Very good.  That's fucking good, Jim.  I don't know why he puts any more stock in the FBI statistics as they are part...  Than the 9-11 fucking investigation report.  ...of the same machine.  Right.  Very good.  That's a good one.  Talk about the guns.  It's not the rock.  It's not the knife.  When a mother chops her kids up with a cleaver because she's on serotonin...  Alex, tell me why I'm wrong about the AR-15.  Why don't you want to get rid of the drugs?  Because they're half your sponsors? 
[01:39:30]  Stick to the subject.  America's number one cause of unratual death now is suicide.  Alex, let's try again.  Not automobile accident, not cancer, not...  You excuse me of attacking the Second Amendment of the Constitution.  I want to get people off pills that the insert says would make you commit suicide and kill people.  Alex, let's get about to the Second Amendment.  I want to blame the real culprit.  Alex.  Suicide pills.  Alex.  Mass murder pills.  Okay, let me ask you one question.  Your belief, and this I'm wrong...  First time anybody's ever heard this, by the way.  Your belief, and this I'm wrong, is that under the Second Amendment, your real concern is that you will be overrun by a tyrannical regime. 
[01:40:00]  Either from somewhere else...  Yeah, highway checkpoints.  Look at Mexico.  Total gun ban for the citizens.  Highest crime rate in the world.  57,000 people dead the last five years.  Total gun ban for the citizens.  But you...  Switzerland has the lowest crime rate in Europe.  Alex.  Your country has the highest.  Alex.  Alex.  We have 35 gun murders a year.  You have 11,000.  You have...  You people get their brains...  It's the higher crime rate.  Alex.  Let me ask you...  Violent crime is higher.  On this specific...  It's brains.  It's people.  I'm trying to get inside your brains.  Pierce. 
[01:40:30]  If you punch me right now, it'd be not your fist, but your brain that did it.  Alex.  Let me get inside your brain.  Okay.  Okay?  I'm serious.  You have a very, very big platform.  You air, I think, on 63 networks.  No, no.  Wikipedia is like 10 years old.  I'm on over 140 stations.  Millions of Americans hear you every day.  Over a million and a half visitors to InfoWars.com today.  And I congratulate you on your audience.  Where we have the statistics posted right now.  InfoWars.com.  Who do you believe was behind 9-11?  Oh, I absolutely know.  I have the police on CNN saying, get back, they're going to blow up 7.  I have BBC reporting. 
[01:41:00]  Who do you believe is behind us?  I have the proof.  I heard them on CBS radio.  Who do you believe, Alex?  They announced they blew up the towers on CBS radio.  Who do you believe?  New Yorkers all saw it and heard it.  Alex, who do you believe?  They blew up building 7.  Alex, who do you believe was behind it?  The American government.  Criminal elements of the military industrial complex.  The same ones that staged Gulf of Tonkin.  The same ones that staged Operation.  The mass shootings.  I like where he's going with this one.  Thank you for your service.  I don't like this right now.  He loved the last point he made.  Go back.  Oh, yeah? 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, he made a point on who's doing the school shootings.  Oh.  Military industrial complex.  The same ones that staged Gulf of Tonkin.  The same ones that staged Operation.  The mass shootings of Operation Gladio.  Right.  Ooh, the CIA don't like this right now.  Do you mean the President Bush administration?  That's right.  They don't like this.  Neither is the FBI.  Who I'm quoting a whole lot.  So it's CIA's bad FBI good.  Is there a bad FBI good?  Operation Gladio? 
[01:42:00]  Right.  Ooh.  Do you mean the CIA don't like this right now?  Do you mean the President Bush administration?  I mean that even mainstream news reported that the hijackers were ordered to be allowed into the United States.  Michael Springman, the head of the visa department, with a whistle on this.  So the Bush administration was part of a conspiracy to murder thousands of Americans.  Well, he should never let us tolerate thousands of Americans.  I can speak in this accent as well.  But is that what you believe?  The government Hitler firebombed his own Reichstag, Pierce, to bring in martial law in Germany, April 27, 1933. 
[01:42:30]  That's a factoid.  The governments have staged terror attacks throughout history, or allowed terrorists to attack, as a pretext to invade and enslave the populations.  I probably own more than 50 firearms.  Many of them have increased in value two, three, or even four times.  I sleep very comfortably outside Austin, Texas, knowing that I can defend my family.  Okay.  Alex Jones.  This is the man who wants to deport me from the country before wanting to get rid of assault rifles. 
[01:43:00]  It's to point out you're a foreigner, a redcoat, here telling us what to do.  Go back to where they took the guns if you don't like it.  The communists took it.  How great is that?  Fucking Alex Jones.  Holy fuckeroni.  And then he's doing his bad English accent right to his face.  That is some great, great audio.  Very, very good.  He said false flag.  Google it, folks. 
[01:43:30]  Google it, folks.  Mass murder pills, and, of course, Operation Gladio.  Operation Gladio.  Operation Gladio.  Great stuff right there.  Alex Jones.  But he didn't have a proper debate.  No.  Piers barely talked.  No.  Good.  You know what?  Good.  It was good TV, though.  I like the fact that someone gets on there, and Piers just fucking has to let them roll  and shut his yap.  Yeah.  Piers.  When someone rambles like that, whenever you pause them, there's always a bunch of things 
[01:44:00]  you can go back over and fucking, oh, excuse me, what about?  We did that on our show.  Yeah, yeah.  We tripped them up.  I just thought it was good.  But that's two arguments that aren't even on the same fucking rail.  Right.  You know what I mean?  Like, Piers was making the argument that, all right, 11,000 gun murders a year in the  United States, 30-something in England.  You can't fucking compare the two.  Obviously, it's a bigger nation here.  They don't allow guns there. 
[01:44:30]  So even the fact that there's 35 is fucking amazing.  Because they don't allow guns.  It's not part of their constitution and their culture.  We do.  In order to get that murder rate down to zero, you'd have to do a lot more than just take  away legal guns.  And that gang violence, the fact that that's 75% of that 11,000 murders a year, that's a  cultural problem.  That is a cultural fucking problem. 
[01:45:00]  That isn't a hardware issue.  It's a cultural problem that needs to be done.  11,000 gun deaths, 75% done by gang bangers.  What's that number, quickly?  I would say that's probably 20, 30 gun deaths.  See, my estimate was a little different.  Let's call 12,000, then it's three-fourths.  So that leaves only 4,000 left.  4,000 people hating their wives.  Not gang-related.  Yeah.  If that stat is completely true.  And the fact that semi-automatic assault weapons are used in a minuscule amount of gun crimes 
[01:45:30]  and gun violence in this country, but that's the one that is the, that's the fucking picture  they put up on the news.  That's the gun that should spur gun control.  Well, they've got to start somewhere.  Well, yeah.  The truth of the matter is, the 9mm semi-automatic handgun is the champion of murder in this country.  And, you know, unfortunately, hey, it's legal.  It's not something you can confiscate or ban because it's such, it's a widespread weapon. 
[01:46:00]  And it's not this military weapon.  It's nothing they can really say people shouldn't have and be allowed to have.  Crazy people, Jimmy.  Crazy people kill people.  We're going to go to break.  We've got Tom Papa here.  Yes, Tom.  Hi.  Good morning.  We're going to continue with some other shit.

Lord Almighty, I feel my temperature rising.  Higher, higher, it's burning through to my soul.  Are you just playing this, E-Rock? 
[01:48:00]  No.  Girl, girl, girl, girl, you gonna set me up.  Is it Elvis' birthday?  Yeah, well, it would have been, yeah.  Oh, what?  What happened?  What?  That's not on our...  What happened?  We don't have a birthday list today.  Really?  I just put it in front of you.  Oh, you just put it in front of me.  How old would he have been?  He would have been 78.  He's still alive, Tom Papa.  I mean, how old is he in Costa Rica?  Yes.  He's 78.  Years young.  Still going strong.  Wow, he must look great. 
[01:48:30]  Where has he been spotted lately?  I love those videos online.  They used to be really, like, into that, back in the National Enquirer and the Weekly World News.  You think Alex Jones would have been into that one?  Into that conspiracy?  That Elvis is still alive?  Elvis is alive and well.  We've seen him in South America.  He's actually responsible for the Gulf of Tonkin incident.  He's an operator.  An operator.  With a false flag.  Last seen in the South Tower.  Yeah, South Tower.  If you look closely here, you see Elvis.  He's performing as the tower falls. 
[01:49:00]  Really?  It was Elvis?  I find 9-11 arguments too exhausting to get into anymore.  Yes.  They are.  I've heard every argument.  I just don't want to hear it anymore.  Nothing new.  Same old argument.  But what does that have to do with Elvis?  Elvis is alive and well.  Yes.  That's not even a conspiracy.  That's not even a conspiracy.  That's just fact.  Mr. Bowie's 66 today.  I mentioned David Bowie because he's not looking too good.  What?  Yeah, they kind of get a picture of him every once in a while.  And I don't know. 
[01:49:30]  Something's going on with David Bowie.  66.  66.  I had him older.  There it is.  Ice, ice, baby.  Ice, ice, baby.  Yeah, check it out.  And when he was trying to say that, he didn't take this song because this goes...  Oh, can we play a club?  This goes...  And Mike goes...  Have you ever...  It goes...  Oh, you've seen this song? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  It looked like an asshole.  Not the same at all.  No.  No.  But he points out exactly where it's different.  It's different.  And then it was exactly the same.  Very confused by the whole thing.  I literally didn't know which one it was which until he said it.  Here it is.  This is suburban Miami Lakes, Florida, who calls himself Vanilla Ice.  His debut single, Ice, Ice, Baby, bulleted at number four on this week's Billboard chart,  has an admittedly great groove, but then it was great when David Bowie and Queen first  came up with it.  We caught up with Vanilla Ice on the Club MTV Presents tour with MC Hammer, and here's 
[01:50:30]  what he had to say for himself.  Wow, MC Hammer.  Jesus.  Oof.  That's an act.  Ha, ha, ha.  What a toll.  Is this from Boogie Nights?  Is this from Boogie Nights?  Being in, you know, predominantly black market, I don't like that to be the part standing out, 
[01:51:00]  but I mean, I'm sure it does, you know, to some people it makes, you know, some kind of  difference, but I like to think, you know, that it does.  Is this Max Hedrick?  Vanilla Ice would like to think it's his music that stands out.  He'd like to.  He'd opened up shows for Public Enemy, Tone Loke, and MC Hammer, but does a white rapper  from Miami Lakes, Florida, worry about being accepted into the very urban-oriented rap  community?  It doesn't matter if I'm from a speech or not.  That's where I learned to rap.  Like many other rappers, Vanilla Ice includes samples and re-recorded versions of other songs  for background beats on his debut album, To the Extreme.  In fact, Ice's top five pop hit, Ice Ice Baby, has a rhythm track that's almost identical 
[01:51:30]  to the 1982 Queen and David Bowie hit, Under Pressure.  Recently, when MC Hammer used the bass line from Super Freak in his number one single,  You Can't Touch This, he gave half of the writing credit to Rick James.  But for Ice Ice Baby, Ice only gives credit to himself and his DJ, Earthquake.  He doesn't sound anything like Under Pressure.  The only part that sounds like Under Pressure is the hook. 
[01:52:00]  We sampled them from him, but it's not the same bass line.  Like he goes, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding 
[01:52:30]  When he was trying to do, like, I don't know, some kind of metal shit.  He was coming back.  Oh, wait, don't I remember that?  Rap metal or something.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  See, he's all hard now.  Oh, wow.  I liked his hair.  I liked his hair like that.  It was all plastic.  That was pretty funny.  Yeah.  It looked fake like plastic hair.  And ours goes...  He looked like one of those waiters in Back to the Future 2 in the 80s fucking...  Right, yeah.  Yeah, the 80s diner. 
[01:53:00]  Is he still Vanilla Ice or is he Ice?  Yeah, the mean kid that would pick on Michael J. Fox.  He just wants to be called anything.  What's he being called?  Wasn't he on the Ice?  He was just Ice.  Yeah, I think he went back.  He was Ice and then he went back to Vanilla Ice.  Oh, God, what do I know?  Puff Daddy and then P. Diddy.  Right.  He's doing a home repair show.  And The Rock and Dwayne Wayne.  Right.  Hold on.  What did you say, McMurphy?  Uh-oh.  He's doing a home repair show now.  Home repair show?  What are you talking about?  Yeah, he goes to different houses and fixes them up for some television show. 
[01:53:30]  That he just started last year.  Really?  Yeah.  Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.  What is the show?  What's the network?  I don't know.  It's a network nobody cares about.  It's probably like Home and Garden's television or something.  Wow.  That's good.  Who pours the fucking basement?  Wang Chung?  Wang Chung?  Flock of Seagulls drywall.  Who puts in the toast to the Doobie Brothers?  Tom, why are you here today? 
[01:54:00]  Damn it.  Tom's off to San Francisco, right?  Yeah, this weekend.  Fucking shit.  Just knows that.  Brought to you by Lumber Liquidators.  Wow.  You're brought to you.  Wow.  You got a sponsor?  I have a sponsor now.  Sponsor?  Wow.  I'm Lumber Liquidators.  I'm sponsoring my tour.  All right.  Well, good for you.  Yeah.  That, I guess, is Vanilla Ice's project.  Oh, there he is.  What's he saying?  It's on the...  Returns to DIY Network. 
[01:54:30]  Watch him build the coolest crib on the Intracoastal.  This really looks like an estate from up here.  I want to showcase it and take it to the next level.  It's just my natural instinct to do that, you know?  Rock and roll.  It's Demolition Day, and we're not messing around.  It is always the next level.  What?  So, Vanilla Ice got into the trades when the music career went south, huh?  Yeah.  It started...  It's kind of sad.  Doing construction.  The DIY Network is not just a network nobody cares about.  It's the same place where Bronson Pinchot has a show.  Balky? 
[01:55:00]  Fucking Balky's got a show?  Ew, did Bronson Pinchot?  Yeah, because he collects houses.  Is anything not on TV at this point?  Now we're just making up networks.  Yes.  It's not the plumbing network.  What are you talking about?  Where's the DIY Network?  Do-it-yourself.  Where is it, though?  Television.  Time Warner have it?  I don't know.  I don't care.  I don't need the answer.  Do-it-yourself.  Tom Pop is going to be at Cobb's Comedy Club, San Francisco, the 10th through the 13th.  Thursday through Sunday. 
[01:55:30]  That sounds exactly like...  Oh, no, it's different.  And little Jimmy Norton's going to be in Nashville.  Yes, I will be.  I understand there's a real buzz about my appearance.  Is there, Jimmy?  Is there?  Hashtag things no one is saying.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy, that's not true.  I'm sure in Nashville there's lots of people.  But they begged you to come back, Jimmy.  I wouldn't say begged.  They kind of begged.  I got an email.  One email and you were hoping there were a lot more...  And I'm off. 
[01:56:00]  As a reply to my email.  There it is.  It shows you how wrong the networks are when they think one person writes.  That means 10,000 or...  No, huh?  When one writes, one wants.  You just thought your inbox would be filled with Nashville requests.  Yeah, hey, we're so happy we're coming.  I've never wanted a fucking cup of soup to open so badly from the bottom.  And fall all over my lap.  Anthony's eating scalding chicken soup, and I want to see it scar on his balls.  You guys live in such a strange world, man, because you're hot in a lot of cities and others you don't draw. 
[01:56:30]  I want to bring up a story from years ago with Jim Norton.  I followed him around the city.  He was going from club to club.  He kills with his set.  I'm trying to remember the club.  I don't remember offhand.  But then he goes to Dangerfields and does the exact same set, and it just sat there.  In the same fucking city.  It gets weird.  It's totally insane.  He went from killing to not getting anything.  Yeah, it's completely insane.  Within an hour.  The one you remember is the Dangerfields one.  Because that's the one that's a low self-esteem moron comic. 
[01:57:00]  They know better than the people who are laughing.  I don't know if you guys like Dangerfields.  It seems to be a very strange room for comedy, because it's so dark with those weird lamps.  You can't see any faces.  You don't even know how many people are in the joint.  It's stuck in 1982.  I haven't worked there in a long time, because they don't do enough about hecklers.  But I always loved Dangerfields.  I paid my rent on Dangerfields in the comedy cellar.  And Dangerfields would be, you get 25 minutes.  I'd set my recorder up, and it was just black. 
[01:57:30]  You can't see the audience at all.  And I would fuck it.  It's like the comedy store in Los Angeles.  And I would just do my set and work on material.  And Dangerfields helped me so much.  Put my fucking beverage and my recorder on that piano.  I spent hours on that stage.  Why don't you go back anymore?  Oh, Nancy Redman used to work there.  Yeah.  Woo-hoo.  Ha-ha-ha.  That's too much.  We're a tuxedo.  Hey, can we get an update on Catherine Webb?  For Tom Papa, you had the national title won by Alabama last night. 
[01:58:00]  They kicked the Fighting Irish's ass.  Notre Dame got a beating.  42-14, I think.  Crushed it.  And, oh, and can we do the Brent or Brent?  Brent Musburger.  Brent Musburger.  So they show Catherine Webb, who is going out with the quarterback for Alabama.  Lucky dude.  And that's all they're talking about.  These guys won a national title.  I'm watching the TVs all morning.  They just keep showing her picture.  I fucked her.  No, you didn't.  She went from 2,000 Twitter followers, and then the paper reported 100,000. 
[01:58:30]  She's up to 100,000.  But now I'm proud to say she's up to 121,000.  Wow.  She's gained 21,000 this morning alone.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  She's purdy is what it is.  She's purdy.  But who looks at that and says, I want to know what she has to say?  We live in a strange fucking world.  We really do.  Here's the Brent Musburger clip.  You might appreciate this, Tom.  Has nothing to do with the game.  And they go a little too far.  Now, when you're a quarterback at Alabama, you see that lovely lady there? 
[01:59:00]  She does good Auburn.  I want to admit that.  But she also is just Alabama.  And that's A.J. McCarron's girlfriend.  Okay?  And right there on the right is D.D. Bonner.  That's A.J.'s mom.  Wow.  I'm telling you, quarterbacks, you get all the good-looking women.  What a beautiful woman.  Wow.  A.J.'s doing some things right down in Texas.  So if you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw it around  the backyard with pops.  With pops. 
[01:59:30]  With pops.  Throw that football around.  You'll be banging girls this hot.  Amazing.  And right next to you is a Mrs. Boner.  I'm Bonner.  Yeah, I am.  And my lap is a boner.  I got it confused looking at this girl.  Wow, is she hot.  Is she ever fucking hot?  He lost his mind.  I'd never pull out.  I'd fatten her up the first time.  Pull out your football and get to work.  Wow.  Don't be such little faggots, kids.  Get out there and play ball.  Stick it where it counts. 
[02:00:00]  Wow.  Isn't that great?  That is a blowout of a game when it gets to that point.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  And she's been on every news station.  We've just been watching a picture pop up on the screens here.  In the bikini.  They love her.  They're not interviewing the quarterback.  They don't care.  It's all about the quarterback's girlfriend.  He's got to be pissed.  He's got a little, Mrs. Berger's got a little bro-caught to him.  He's gotten the rolling.  We were saying it sounded like his dentures were coming out. 
[02:00:30]  Because people with their dentures, they pull this thing where they've got to say their S's like this.  Because if you go with an S, we'll push them straight out of your face.  That we noticed.  You ruined that for me.  The first Star Trek movie, the newer one that they made.  The guy that, well, Leonard Nimoy, Spock.  Yeah.  He's trying to talk over his dentures.  Live long and prosper.  Prosper.  Are they still in?  I would give you my normal salute, but that would seem self-serving. 
[02:01:00]  Really, Spock?  On Vulcan, they haven't come up with a better thing than dentures.  Yeah, they still have George Washington wooden teeth.  Right, right.  Got a little Rana Fez.  Got to give him the credit.  Rana Fez spy report.  Because someone said I got a spy report.  Spy report.  That's a Rana Fez thing.  Bowie releasing an album in March.  And the video is creepy as usual.  Really? 
[02:01:30]  So there you go.  It's so funny there was a time that you had to fess up about taking people's music.  Like now it's just, you just do it.  Now it's commonplace.  No one says like, oh, that's from.  Right.  Back then, though, they're like, I was fucking.  Years ago, they called it stealing.  Now, they call it sampling.  Back after this.  Why don't we move on to Al Roker?  Al Roker was at the White House. 
[02:02:00]  Pooping.  Yeah, he had that stomach stapling thing.  Ordinary guy?  Yeah, regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  That's regular Joe.  Okay, I was wondering who that was, Jimmy.  Regular Joe.  Just, you know, he's saying what everyone's thinking.  Yeah.  Joe Bag at Dublin, they call me.  Well, Roker.  I don't know why Roker had a cover.  I guess he's looking for a little press.  Publicity?  Yeah.  He gets a lot of publicity at this time of year because it's all about New Year's and losing weight.  Right?  And your diet plans.  That's true. 
[02:02:30]  But he cheated.  And they, yeah.  If you go to the stomach stapling, I mean, God bless you, but you're cheating.  Right.  If they're cutting you open and taking your parts and sealing them up, that's not like doing crunches.  No, it's not.  What would happen to good old days?  You know, you just go there, you lift a few dumbbells, and all of a sudden it's, hey, fix it for me.  What a regular guy.  That's a regular guy's perspective.  That's what every guy's thinking out there, you know?  It's refreshing to hear what the average Joe is thinking. 
[02:03:00]  Give me a container of coffee on a construction site.  I'm just talking.  Oh, those look delicious.  Let me just smash my crackers.  That's a nice, crispy, original crackers here.  I'm sorry.  I like a good cracker, too.  I like a good cracker.  That's how the regular Joe gets a laugh.  Yeah.  He's practical jokes.  I don't know why Al Roker felt like he had to tell the world this, but this is what he's saying today.  When you have a bypass and your bowel has been reconstructed, you think you're pretty safe. 
[02:03:30]  And I probably went off and ate something I wasn't supposed to.  And as I'm walking to the press room, I think I've got to pass a little gas here.  So I'm walking by myself.  Who's going to know?  The fuck is he?  And then suddenly a little something extra came out.  You pooped in your pants?  I pooped my pants.  Not horribly, but enough that I knew.  Why?  Which is a common side effect of this surgery.  Exactly.  And so I was panicking. 
[02:04:00]  So I got to the restroom of the press room, threw out the underwear, and just went commando.  And what did that tell you?  It told me that I've got to be very vigilant as to what I eat.  That's why I hate the news.  What did that tell you?  Why aren't you laughing?  That's hilarious.  What show is this?  Or saying that's fucking disgusting.  Something.  What show is this on?  What does that tell you?  What does that tell you?  Yeah, Dateline.  How is that not a problem?  How is that not an offensive bout? 
[02:04:30]  Right.  It's talking about functions.  Way more disgusting than Janet Jackson's nipple slip.  Yeah.  I want to hear about him shitting himself when I turn on the TV.  His first bad decision, I'm in the White House, I said, no, I'm going to fart, and who's  going to know?  Yeah, yeah.  No, you hold that, you're in the White House, you don't let one go on the way to the press  room.  Clinch those butt cheeks, yo.  You know what I say?  White House, brown underwear.  Is that a joke?  It's what every regular guy's thinking right now.  Anybody with a lunch pail? 
[02:05:00]  TMI, Al, TMI.  What?  Uh-oh.  Is that why she was giving me the back and forth finger?  Yep.  So much shit happens around here.  Wait, what was the back and forth?  Uh, morning mashup walked by, and then Nicole gave me the uh, uh, uh.  That was her toe, though.  It wasn't her foot.  She was scratching her head with a fucking monkey foot.  Giant footed fucking gorilla.  They're making a move for the Martha Stewart studio.  Yeah, the morning mashup.  And when is Gary going to give us our update today? 
[02:05:30]  I think he made it clear to you he's going to be off today.  Well, that's not happening.  No, let's, let's do it now.  Do I want to get the update now?  Yes.  Let me get down here and do it live on the air.  Please go tell him, Sam.  Should I invite him to the studio?  Okay.  Tell him, uh, the boys are ready for their update.  Yes.  Is that verbatim?  Yes.  It's going to be big.  Yes.  It's going to be big.  I hope so.  But she couldn't have a real moment with that?  What does that tell you?  Well, they had to keep it serious.  That's a question you ask world leaders after some kind of policy change.  You had to keep it fucking, you know, what does that tell you? 
[02:06:00]  Right.  You had to keep it newsy.  You had to keep it serious.  You're not allowed to laugh when Al Roker just told you he grabbed himself.  He shit himself.  Ugh.  And then went commando.  Ah, yeah.  We had, uh, remember, remember Crazy Jim?  Oh, yeah.  He, that same thing happened to him, and then he tells a story how he goes into, was it  a McDonald's?  And he, he, he used to put his shit underwear under the drop ceiling.  Yeah, he had to, like, stash it up there, throw it up there.  This guy we knew.  A sales guy we used to work with in Boston. 
[02:06:30]  He shit himself.  I missed the guy.  He was amazing.  He would tell these crazy stories, and we know they were all real.  And he said he shit his pants on the way to a sales meeting once, so he poked the  tile so it pops up and put his shit underwear up there.  Oh, my God.  Very nice.  Yeah.  I bet if you pop the ceiling in a McDonald's bathroom and look around up there, you'll  see some weird shit.  Really?  I bet you'll see some weird shit.  Fuck, that's what I want to do now.  Oh, man.  That's not the best shit story that we've had on our show. 
[02:07:00]  What?  Anyone?  Holy shit.  Anyone?  Whatever it is, I can top it.  Anyone?  I bet he can.  Celebrity shit stories, anyone?  We've played it before.  Iraq, you got it, right?  Yes.  You know.  Iraq, no?  Oh!  Well, somebody let me onto it.  I read it.  Anthony Furr, the almost win.  Yeah.  Who?  George Brett.  He had a good shit story.  Can we replay that?  He had a fun shit story.  Have you ever heard the George Brett shit story?  No.  You know how they mic the fucking coaches and the players? 
[02:07:30]  I think he was a batting coach or something at this point.  Yeah.  And it's batting practice, and he's just standing around, and he's just telling this other  guy how he should have been himself, but he was really into telling this story.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  And Sam's jogging back down the hall.  We'll get an update.  Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  It's different.  A little different.  A little different.  It's totally different.  Just waiting for Iraq to find a story.  Sam?  Sam.  Here we go.  The big update.  Did you talk to the radio whiz kid? 
[02:08:00]  Of course I did.  Well, I walked in, and immediately he said, I'm not going down there.  And then I said, but...  Then you put your cock away.  Get it?  I got it.  He's going to suck his dick.  I said, but the boys are ready for their update.  Right.  And he said, I'll talk to them off the air.  Okay.  Tell the radio wizard, a.k.a.  idiot.  Jesus.  Oh.  And I'm serious.  Go down there now and say, I don't need to talk to him.  I'll go and talk to Scott Greenstein after the show. 
[02:08:30]  Whoa!  You, not me.  Right.  You can talk for me, but please say, hey, idiot.  I'm not going to use that word.  Leap frog.  I'm not playing that game.  To the top.  He's not playing that game with us.  It goes on the air.  Oh, boy.  You go down there, you tell him someone's going to leave boot prints on his chin.  Get at him.  Oh, damn.  Regular Joe.  I'll go talk to Greenstein.  I'm not playing.  You can say it because Opie said.  Actually, punch him in the face and say, Opie would have punched you.  So it's not me.  See?  See how that works? 
[02:09:00]  I understand.  Seriously.  Go now and tell him.  There's going to be no update from you because Opie will talk to fucking Scott Greenstein.  Okay.  I won't use that word, though.  I'm not playing with fucking middle management anymore.  It's like a little carrier pigeon.  You're useless unless you're on the air with this stuff.  Oh, man.  It's totally useless.  Useless.  Because you don't make any of the decisions anyway.  So you come in.  We have a little fun with you because you're stupid middle management.  And we move on.  Maybe it's his first day in radio.  Oh.  There may be an element that's not allowed on the air yet.  I'll find out from Scott.  Oh, really?  I'll find out from Scott Greenstein. 
[02:09:30]  It's fine.  Iraq, you got the George Brett shitting story?  Yes.  It's two parts because it's long.  Because he's really into it.  You want to hear this today, Tom Popper?  Sure.  There's going to be a Cops Comedy Club in San Francisco this weekend?  I'd love to.  She's throwing you the eyes like, don't you dare.  Yeah.  As long as she's not throwing me the feet.  Can't think of anything else but her giant feet.  She has giant feet.  I heard.  You heard?  I heard.  I was listening the other day.  She's an amazing swimmer. 
[02:10:00]  Open her own coconuts with her toes.  She could.  Oh, that's damn.  Sam's jogging back.  Long toes.  Can you tell?  He's jogging back.  He wants to see a ghost.  He's not smiling, though.  Now he's trying to smile a little bit.  He's smirking.  Looks like he's got punches in the eye.  He's got a smirk on his face, but I don't see anyone following him.  Did you enjoy that?  Yeah, on some level.  All right, good.  So what happened?  He said, no worries.  Good.  No worries.  What does no worries mean?  He'll be out of a job soon.  What?  What's he working at Club Med? 
[02:10:30]  No worries.  It's all good.  It's only radio, man.  All right.  Hey, why are you see fucking my girlfriend?  Hendel.  Hendel.  We'll never forget Hendel.  Hey, man.  It's all good, man.  Leave your luggage here.  We'll get it into the room for you.  It's all good.  What?  Me and Anthony were played, which is fine now because we don't give a fuck about those  women.  Oh, they were all smitten.  All smitten.  I love that story.  You want to tell it for the 25th time?  By the island dude? 
[02:11:00]  The island guy that all they have to do is be in the sun and work out.  Right.  That's Hendel.  And then you come from New York with your pasty white in the middle of the winter body.  Okay.  And then you have to now compete with the girl you brought down there.  And they make you do things that they do so much fucking better, like fucking swimming  and trapezing.  There's some French slob fucking doing flips and catching the trapeze.  Right.  And then you're there hanging, like, for your life. 
[02:11:30]  I went back to the room early because I had enough.  And then I'm woken up because I hear giggling, my girlfriend giggling outside the door because  the French trapeze artist walked her home.  Oh, no.  Just the shit you have to deal with.  You just want to go on vacation and get away from, you know, winter for a week.  And you got to fucking compete with jungle fever.  Yeah.  You're fighting off like, it's like the walking dead with zombies.  They're just coming after your chick.  Nah, get her.  We went on a snorkeling thing, and the guy, I swear to you, told us not to touch any of 
[02:12:00]  the fucking...  Don't touch any of the sea life down there.  You're going to see some shells and sea anemone and starfish.  Goes, don't touch any of them.  They're very delicate.  And then he puts a knife in his mouth and dives in.  Does a perfect fucking jackknife off the bow of the boat with a knife in his mouth.  And comes up with some sea life.  He has a starfish.  And here's an example of what I'm talking about.  Wow, my hero.  This is a starfish.  Oh, the thing you told us not to touch, because we'd have looked cool. 
[02:12:30]  I wish my boyfriend could do this.  Yeah.  Real case of do as I say, not as I do.  Regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  You get the point of what we're trying to say.  That's why he vacations at Branson.  I don't go to no Caribbean vacation.  Yeah, sure.  Yeah, you keep the U.S. dollars right here.  Tom, this will be the short version of this story.  I mean, we probably do an hour and a half on this.  We went on a booze cruise. 
[02:13:00]  It was like a cake party down the beach, but they had to take a boat, right?  Yep.  And this woman we flew with, because it's a plane filled with people that are going to be at the resort.  So you see everyone before and after.  We see this girl hugging and kissing her boyfriend.  I'm going to miss you, right?  Fast forward, on the way back from this fucking cake party on the beach, she's blowing the...  I'm saying the captain, but she's blowing the guy...  The drunk guy driving the boat. 
[02:13:30]  Driving the little fucking boat that could fit maybe 20, 25 people back to the resort.  As a massive thunderstorm is bearing down on us, he starts slowing the fucking boat down because he's getting ahead.  He's enjoying himself.  Yeah, yeah.  He was enjoying himself, so he didn't want to get back to the dock.  But we're just looking at these clouds coming up behind us.  And she's blowing them in front of everybody on the boat?  She's underneath a little...  She's underneath a little...  I mean, everyone knew, but everyone was fucking buzzing with her.  And you saw the lightning strikes, everything. 
[02:14:00]  And then we fly back to JFK, and she runs right into the arms of her boyfriend.  Hi, baby, did you have a good time?  She was sucking the guy's dick on the boat.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah, the whole way back.  I swear to you, the guy slowed down, because it wasn't that...  It was maybe a 20-minute ride, Tops.  I'm sure that happens every week with that guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Every time a new crop comes in, he knows all the moves.  He knows exactly when.  Do you think Hendel fucks a lot of girls?  Yeah, that's Hendel.  Looks like he's going bald, though, because he's got a hat on in every picture.  Oh, he's got like a schmata. 
[02:14:30]  Is he well-built?  An accent.  Yeah.  He's an animal.  Asshole.  He's a glistening, not an ounce of fat on an asshole.  Oh, are those guys...  No, he's actually a nice guy.  He'd have brought top dollar.  With an accent, the knowledge...  He had the...  He had that French accent that some of the women go for.  Of course.  And then he probably had the big donger, because he's 64.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, man.  Black.  Yeah, that was a good...  There you are.  Probably. 
[02:15:00]  He's all cock.  His whole body is just a life support system for that giant gift.  That fucking unclipped island cock.  Sand dragger.  And then he mesmerizes you with the term, it's all good.  It's all good.  So you might have real questions, like, were you out with my girl?  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's okay.  You're there in your Tevas.  Yeah.  In your pink legs.  Does he smile a lot?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:15:30]  Where half your vacation, you can't move, because you took a little too much sun in.  Right.  And he's just...  Well, I'll take her out.  Yeah.  I guess you can't move, so I'll take her out.  I think the water made me ill.  I'm going to stay in my room.  It's all good.  It's all good.  It's all good.  He says it's all good.  Rest up.  All right.  I guess it's all good, then.  I'll just be a paradox.  Do you tip him at the end?  I don't remember.  I don't think I gave him a dime.  I was a kid when I went there.  Fucking...  I was a kid.  Do you tip him at the end?  Yeah. 
[02:16:00]  Imagine paying him for fucking your girl.  That's terrible.  Yes, I can.  Sounds like a good plan.  Fucking cuck.  That's great.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  He is a nice guy, though.  I don't know.  It was the other ones that...  Well, but he probably was the worst offender if he was that nice, right?  Probably.  Yeah.  There's always the single...  Why am I giving him a break?  Yeah.  There's always the one divorcee, two coming by herself, no friends.  Oh, yeah.  You know that's hurting. 
[02:16:30]  I'm just going to get away.  The friends told her, you go, girl.  You deserve it.  You go down there by yourself.  He treated you like crap.  It's time for you to just spread your wings, girl.  Oh, by wings, she means fucking legs.  It's just time for you.  She's working just fucking everything that moves.  She's working five penises at one time.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  It's amazing.  Opa!  Sorry.  Go down there, act like a real Miss Busybody.  Oh, fuck.  The other Brett...  George Brett.  Yeah, the...  I know.  What about morals? 
[02:17:00]  George Brett.  What happened to that in this day and age?  Out the window.  So, George Brett was on the field as a batting coach, I believe, and he was mic'd up for the  game.  All right.  So, obviously, they're constantly recording, and George Brett had this to say.  Right side.  Back to the right, gentlemen.  Both hands.  Right side.  Pardon.  To the left side.  I shit my pants last night.  I did.  Went out and had a great meal.  Just a great fucking meal.  I had to go to the bathroom so bad in the car. 
[02:17:30]  I'm going, travel, hurry up, man.  I got to shit.  I had fucking shit in my pants.  I'm good twice a year for that.  When was the last time you shit your pants?  Me?  Yeah.  Been a while?  It's been a while.  I was in Vegas a couple years ago.  Just an honest, I got a true story.  Staying with Bellagio.  Went over to Mirage for dinner.  Met some friends of mine over there.  Went to Kokomo's, a great little steakhouse.  The guy brings out some fresh crab legs.  He just came in.  I got to give them to you guys. 
[02:18:00]  I'm eating them.  Then we go play gamble a little bit.  He tells a good story.  Tea time early in the morning.  So I said, look, I got to get going.  I'm walking back to the hotel.  I get three quarters of the way out of the lobby.  And all of a sudden I go, oh, fuck.  And I'm standing here like this.  I got my butt pinched so fucking, I'm fucked.  I can't move.  All of a sudden, you know, felt all right.  I went just like this.  Water.  I had some food poisoning from the crabs.  Take off my leather jacket. 
[02:18:30]  Tied it around my waist.  And I'm just standing there.  And it's just running down my leg.  I got jeans on, black bucks, no socks.  And I just start fucking walking.  Every time I'm walking, something's coming out.  It's water.  Straight fucking water.  He was literally shitting into his shoes.  One of the greatest hitters of all time.  Can I have your autograph?  Wow.  That's only part one.  Oh, my God.  A couple times a year. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, right?  What's wrong with him?  I'd like to tell him, go get that checked.  You got part two?  That's what everyone's thinking.  Then, to tell you how sick I was.  Tell you how sick I was.  Then I'm standing outside and I got to kill my cell phone and I called the guy.  I said, Larry, you won't believe this.  I'm standing outside the fucking Bellagio.  I can't move.  I got shit everywhere.  I shit all over myself.  And Larry's about a 48 waist.  So he brings me over a pair of pants and some towels and some towels. 
[02:19:30]  And so then he comes over and he meets me.  I tell him where I'm standing.  He finds the closest bathroom.  When you go up the escalator, you go into the fucking...  I can't get in the elevator.  But you are not.  You lose.  You know?  So he goes in.  And he finds the closest bathroom in the lobby of the hotel.  And then I get in the escalator.  And he kind of pretends like he dropped something so no one gets behind me.  Tells me where it is.  I go in there.  He goes and gets the towel all wet for me.  Throws it over the fucking stall.  I take off all my fucking clothes.  Just wipe off.  Leave my shoes. 
[02:20:00]  Left my shoes.  My pants.  Everything right there.  The towels right there in the stall.  Imagine not knowing you have George Brett's shirt and his pants that are 48 waist through  the lobby like this.  It's midnight.  Got up in the morning.  Took the most perfect double tapered shit I've ever had in my life.  Double, double tapered.  True story.  True story.  True story.  What a fucking great guy he is.  That is a guy.  What a guy.  Now, compare that with the story we heard earlier from Sal. 
[02:20:30]  Right?  That is a man telling a story.  He was so proud of every aspect of that story.  Perfect double tapered shit.  Just in case you wonder if there was something wrong with him.  Right, right.  He's fine.  Right back to business.  Nothing guys love more than a great shit you pants story.  That will trump, that's the only thing that will trump a fucking pussy story.  A fuck story, yeah, yeah.  It's a great shit your pants story.  Every time.  And that's the thing about being a guy, you know that you have a really good shit. 
[02:21:00]  Your guy friends will listen to it.  Oh, they'll listen.  And he did a great job.  The setup was there.  You felt you were with him.  Clinching your ass cheeks.  Here's something you'll never hear.  I shit my pants.  I don't want to hear that.  Please.  It's always followed by what happened.  What happened?  What happened?  Where were you?  How much shit came out?  Who knew?  Perfect.  Did you ruin them?  How bad did it smell?  Who noticed?  How many times has this happened?  Can I be there when it happens again? 
[02:21:30]  It's a really unfollowable question.  Everyone has their number one.  Oh, that's so funny.  Well, the number two, so to speak.  Number two.  Oh, my God.  That's fucking funny.  I love a good shit your pants story.  I love it.  Oh, it's hilarious.  I've almost shit my pants a bunch of times, and I've almost regretted not, because this  story would be so much better if I had shat my pants.  Just let it go.  Hey, you guys want to talk to Eddie Money?  What?  He's on that commercial all the fucking time.  Oh, God.  He looks so weird. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Don't take it to paradise.  Eddie Money.  His name says no.  What?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Eddie Money.  There was a time Eddie Money wanted to be my friend.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's got weird eyes.  Yeah, he really does.  What about those fucking dumbass commercials of those two guys?  I'm so done with those guys.  Happier than fucking shut up.  Why is that Jimmy?  I don't know.  Why is that Jimmy?  What?  Oh, what are they?  Like, what are they doing?  I don't know.  What's their fucking?  Is that an act they do? 
[02:22:30]  It's like hipster.  Yeah.  Two guys here.  I'm happier than a Jew in the bank.  Ah, it's a little racy.  Yeah, whatever.  It's been said on the site.  I don't like that.  I don't like that kind of talk.  Who are you calling?  Eddie Money.  Oh, he's got Eddie Money's number.  He's calling.  Oh.  He's trying to get him.  He's trying to get him.  He's trying to hang out.  He wants to hang out.  He wants to be on there right now.  But if you leave your name and number, I'll get you.  Oh, he changed his name.  His voice is a lot higher.  Whoa, what's that about?  His voice is a lot higher these days.  I've got two tickets to paradise. 
[02:23:00]  That should be Eddie Money.  Wow.  Eddie Money changed his number.  Eddie Money gave you the wrong number.  Yes.  Exactly.  You're probably right.  Here's the number.  Just fucking leave a message.  We'll try to get Eddie Money on the phone.  Because now he's a big star.  When he came in here, he was like, you know, big star.  He was playing like a Holiday Inn or something.  Now he's doing commercials.  Fucking Gallagher did one of those commercials.  Now he's doing Geico commercials.  Yeah.  All right.  We got Tom Papa at Cobb's Comedy Club at San Francisco. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  We got Jim Norton in Nashville.  Yeah.  And we got Games of Thrones guy coming in.  Games of Thrones guy.  Yes.  Games of Thrones.  Game of Thrones.  There's not more than one game.  It's just one game.  There's only one game.  One game of a bunch of thrones.  There's many thrones.  In all fairness, it says Games of Thrones.  No.  No.  Who wrote that?  Oh, it does.  Games of Thrones.  Who wrote Games of Thrones?  No, it doesn't really say that, does it?  It does.  It says Games of Thrones.  Games of Thrones.  That's why I said that. 
[02:24:00]  Who wrote that?  I was just fucking around.  Who wrote that?  You don't want to know who wrote that.  Because it's the.  Sal.  Because it's the prep sheet again.  Sal did it.  And also didn't tell us about.  I had a reason why I said that.  Yeah.  No Elvis birthday.  Nicolaj.  Jesus.  Coster.  Waldo.  Did it say Games of Thrones?  Waldo.  It can't be Waldo.  Waldo.  It's going to call him Nicolai.  It's hard to say.  Yeah, hard to say.  Who does he play on?  Nicolai.  Games of Thrones.  Jamie Lannister.  Nice.  Jamie Lannister.  One of the leads and a motherfucker.  Yeah, yeah.  A motherfucker. 
[02:24:30]  Really, really.  It's great.  Vile character.  Yeah.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  I'm going to leave early.  Sal did it.  Because I don't want any spoilers.  What?  I don't want any spoilers.  Oh, my goodness.  Because I haven't seen the show, so I'm going to have to leave early.  You haven't seen it?  No.  You've seen it?  Oh, yeah.  Sex scenes.  A lot of good sex scenes.  I look up and see sex scenes.  You have good sex scenes and a sword comes out.  That's what I don't like.  Yeah.  Oh.  Is that necessary?  Tell a good story.  I saw the scene where...  Fucking regular Joe.  I saw the scene where the little kid is watching that couple have sex. 
[02:25:00]  They might have been brother and sister.  I'm not sure.  Yes, they are.  And then the guy goes, ah, fuck you, and then pushes him to his death.  Keep him out the window.  I see games of Thrones.  That's him.  He ends up crippled.  That's what's coming in.  Ah.  That guy.  That's him.  So I could talk about that scene.  Yeah.  It's the only scene I know.  The real...  And little things walk around.  Little things.  Little fellas walk around.  What's his name?  Peter...  Dinglinger.  Dinglinger.  He's good.  He won the Emmy.  He's a great actor.  But he's a little... 
[02:25:30]  It's good to see a dwarf play a real role.  And yet his dwarfism is addressed.  Shut up, little man.  But dwarf.  But he's not...  He doesn't play a dwarf.  He's a caser man.  It's really an interesting way of...  He doesn't run around...  Like, I think that every time he runs around, the music should go...  A tree-le-dee-le-dee-dee.  A tree-le-dee-do-le-dee-do.  Coins falling out behind him.  Happy music.  Hi.  Don't you know.  Everyone tickles his belly when he enters the room. 
[02:26:00]  I would say, cut, cut.  I told you, whenever you run, to make your arms go to and fro.  A tree-le-dee-dee-dee-dee-do.  A tree-le-dee-dee-dee-dee.  To and fro.  Oh, fuck.  Ah, here he comes.  And the Emmy goes to...  The wee little man.  Yes.  Spins around in a rain cloud behind him.  You think he would get mad at that?  Oh, yeah.  You think he's had it?  Oh, yeah.  He's the same one from Elf. 
[02:26:30]  Yes, he is.  Yes, he was in Elf.  And the station agent.  He was.  And Elf, he ran across that very long conference table.  It took him forever to get to the other side.  Yeah.  We get it.  We get the joke.  Right.  It takes a long time for him to run, even if it's a conference table.  Ah, what are you going to do up the hole?  We're all belongs in a loony bin.  This is the Opie Anthony Channel. 
[02:27:00]  On Sirius XM.  New from Puddin' Head Records, Opie and Anthony present...  Sittin' and singin' the Handikap Hits.  Oi, rollin' with the devil.  Yes, I'm rollin'.  It's all the rock you know and love.  Done specifically for people without leg mobility.  Cause traps like goods.  And baby, we were born to roll. 
[02:27:30]  Just because your legs don't work doesn't mean your ears don't.  Just ask Van Halen.  I wish I could jump.  I'm never going to jump.  Might as well just sit here.  The hits just keep rolling in.  If only they could walk.  Ah, yes.  I would roll 100 miles in.  I would roll 500 more.  But my hands would hurt because I'm rolling.  Get it?  I sit in the chair that you're in. 
[02:28:00]  Now face north.  You roll around 90 degrees and still just sit here.  It's sitting and singing the Handicap Hits from your pals at Puddin' Head Records and The Opie and Anthony Show.  Serious, serious accents.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Got Tom Poppins in studio with a bad neck.  Ow!  Why the bad neck there, Tom Poppins? 
[02:28:30]  I don't know.  All that head bobbing up and down.  That's true.  It's so bad that in the middle of the night, I just kept waking up.  I was thinking about you because I kept waking up.  I couldn't lift my head.  It was like a baby whose head's too.  Literally, my neck wasn't big enough to open.  Painful.  I fell asleep on a flight, like for two hours, just all bent over.  In that weird position.  They don't make it easy to sleep on airplanes, subways, fucking trains in general. 
[02:29:00]  Jimmy's got it all sewn up.  He knows.  Jimmy and I.  Where were we flying back from?  Neck pillow, right?  We were in some weird place.  Phoenix.  And we just...  It's six in the morning.  There's Jimmy.  In the airport.  Just sitting there.  So we sat next to each other on the plane.  Jimmy has total equipment.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  There is no messing around.  He's prepared.  I have my neck pillow, which I put in the front so I can lay down on it. 
[02:29:30]  And I usually use to travel with a blanket, too.  You do look silly with a neck pillow in front.  Like an asshole.  He really does.  But he doesn't have this stiff neck.  You know what?  What am I, in a beauty contest?  Ah, good one.  No stiff neck for Jim Norton?  No.  No, not at all.  Just no sleep either.  No stiff cock either.  Oh, sorry.  You're not lying.  He's got the ear plugs in.  He's got the thing on.  Yep.  He did the hood.  He did the sweatshirt.  Everything but the gift of sleep.  Oh, shit.  He's all set up for it, but it doesn't matter. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, I'm ready to sleep if I didn't have fucking...  You're too prepared, I think.  Eye mask.  He has the eye mask thing.  Eye mask.  He puts that on.  Oh, yeah, the eye mask.  It's by Apple.  That's...  Oh, God.  Great.  So eye mask, ear plugs.  Ear plugs, the donut around his shirt.  He's fucking Tommy.  He's got the sweatshirt.  Tied over his head.  Yeah.  He's the boy in the plastic bubble.  Yeah.  I don't like anybody...  I don't like any light going into my eyes.  No?  No.  Completely rigged up.  Yep.  And... 
[02:30:30]  Wow.  It's amazing.  But your neck's okay.  Yeah, it is, but I take a sore neck and a gift of sleep.  Oh, man.  I had to get up.  And you don't want to mess with him, because he's just...  He's there, and I'm on the window, and I had to go to the bathroom.  Oh, no, you know what?  Because God forbid he did fall asleep, and you woke him up.  Exactly.  I did, and he did.  Oh, no.  He did, and he did.  I started climbing over him, like, doing, like, the yoga, like, tiptoes, trying to get  over him with, like, a high jumper. 
[02:31:00]  The crime fucking movie, where you're trying to get through the laser beam alarm thing.  Yeah, exactly.  Fucking, yeah.  I'm like, I really, I can't bother him.  And then I'm like, this is ridiculous.  So I just put my head on his face.  Yeah.  And started rubbing up and down.  It's like a giant eclipse.  Like a kitten.  Aw.  I slept for about, probably, eh, maybe two and a half hours last night.  I finally dozed on.  Nice.  That's good for you.  And I had my window open.  I sleep my window open, and the fucking wind came in.  And you know, like, you lift the metal thing for your vent to turn your, you know, your 
[02:31:30]  cool.  So the fucking wind blew the curtain, and I woke up to slam!  It was like the metal thing closing.  And I hear that all the time, because I always forget that it's up.  So when I open the window, the fucking wind blows the curtain.  The curtain knocks into it.  So I was asleep for a twine.  I looked at the clock.  From about 2.25, I looked at the clock again.  It was 2.49.  And I was awake for a while, and I finally fell asleep.  And then, uh, I probably got in five or six hours in the last two nights total.  Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Terrible.  It's terrible. 
[02:32:00]  The poor fuck.  I literally...  Are you drinking coffee too late?  No.  When's your last cup of coffee?  Quarter after 11?  Usually.  No.  Usually when I leave here, or maybe, like, last night I had one...  If I drink coffee at 2, 3 in the afternoon, it fucks me.  Last night I had one at like 5 p.m., but that's rare.  It doesn't matter.  I can't sleep anyway.  Because when I adjusted that, it really helped me a lot.  I put the nose pillows in, my apnea mask, and it's fucking...  My heart's beating faster.  Doosh, doosh, doosh.  See, it makes my heart beat faster.  What does?  The fucking apnea machine.  Maybe you're in love. 
[02:32:30]  Oh, it's funny.  I hope she writes.  Hey, Cupid over here.  You guys want the story of the day?  Yeah.  Are we ready for story of the day?  I don't know if I'm ready.  We almost missed out on this one.  I don't know what it is.  Remember Buzz Aldrin?  Of course.  He better still be alive.  We've had Buzz Aldrin on, right?  Yes.  The second man to walk on the moon.  Remember that gal he was with?  That gal?  Yeah.  He brought in a gal.  She just got half his money. 
[02:33:00]  Aw.  They fucked Buzz Aldrin in a divorce?  You can't fuck Buzz Aldrin in a divorce.  Married 23 years.  She didn't walk on the fucking moon.  Thank you.  Holy shit.  The guy risked life and limb for country.  Wait, wait, wait.  They were married 23 years, so she wasn't even with him when he was walking on the fucking moon.  He was 59 when they got married.  How is that possible that she gets half?  He makes about $600,000 a year.  Holy shit.  On what?  I told you I saw them.  You make more than an astronaut? 
[02:33:30]  At, uh...  I feel really embarrassed right now.  We should.  We should never make more than an astronaut.  Oh, assholes making more than an astronaut.  I'll never complain again.  Yes.  I feel like the biggest douchebag right now.  Can't complain.  What are you going to do?  I don't know how much I make.  Maybe that was just a joke for the show.  Top pop-up.  Sure it was.  All right.  I saw Buzz and his wife at that New Jersey thing when Voss and I inducted Abbott and Costello 
[02:34:00]  into the New Jersey Hall of Fame.  So that's when I got him to sign my picture because I was still dating my ex at the time.  And I asked Buzz to sign.  It was a picture of me and him because we interviewed him.  Wow.  And he's such a dick.  Really?  I'm like, would you sign this?  Buzz is a little fucking asshole.  He's a dick.  And he goes, ah, I'm like, it's a picture of you and I.  I interviewed you.  He goes, ah, not right now.  Maybe later.  And he walked out with his wife.  And so apparently my girlfriend, you know, comes back a little while later.  She goes, give me the picture.  I'm like, what?  She goes, just give it to me.  So I give it to her and she comes back five minutes later with it signed. 
[02:34:30]  Dear Jim, Buzz Aldrin, Apollo 13.  You were signed all night.  I'm like, what happened?  She goes, I think he wants to fuck me.  Or whatever it was.  She goes, I think he wants to fuck me because he was flirting with me.  So I just got him to sign the picture.  And I guess what had happened was she was sitting there and she said something like, yeah,  my boyfriend has a picture with you.  And he goes, oh, I'll sign it.  And so she came back with it.  He goes, oh, I didn't mean right now.  And his wife goes, just sign it, Buzz.  Like, his wife doesn't know about it.  Yeah, she's had enough.  I didn't mean right now.  Sign the fucking thing. 
[02:35:00]  But he knew it.  But she said as soon as he signed it, a lot of people came over with napkins.  Oh, no.  It opened the floodgates.  Yeah, he was right.  But you can't.  So he's a bit of a dick?  But you can't give his wife half the fucking money.  He was on the moon.  He could be a dick.  He was on the moon.  You're right.  How old is he now?  82 or 83.  He's back on the market, the article says.  82, 83, and you have to give away half your shit?  They say Buzz Aldrin is back on the market for another moon gal.  Oh. 
[02:35:30]  This isn't for a moon gal.  Oh, moon gal.  Where did they live?  What state?  I don't know.  Florida.  Florida?  I would guess.  I would guess, yes.  The famed astronauts.  Cocoa Beach.  Cocoa Beach, right.  Like fucking astronauts.  Boca.  Yeah.  The Out of This World.  It's all.  Oh, how many puns?  Not enough, right?  We're just spacey puns.  Well, I missed this one.  All right.  If you want to go with the puns.  The famed astronaut and wife, number three, whose license plate bears the celestial moniker,  officially divorced on December 28th.  Blast off.  The Out of This World settlement leaves Aldrin's ex, Louise Driggs, Cannon, with nearly half 
[02:36:00]  of the 82-year-old spaceman's fortune.  God.  You can't do that.  You get all the way to the end of your life.  You played the game right.  You just want to coast and not have to worry about cash.  And she wasn't even around there.  How much did she get?  It's just not fair for guys, man.  Like divorce cases.  How many more?  I think he's got $475 in the bank.  She gets 30% of his annual income for spousal support.  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy read the story.  Very good.  I believe it's $600,000 a year, so that's probably $180,000 a year she's going to make. 
[02:36:30]  She's set to pocket.  $9,000 a month.  Yeah, let me read this word for word because it's infuriating.  Fucking annoying.  Guys just get fucked.  It's ridiculous.  She's set to pocket half of his $475,000 bank account and 50% of any profit he makes  from his businesses.  Jeez.  I understand taking care of the woman after.  That's fucking disgusting.  After marriage is over.  That's disgusting.  The woman gets to live the lifestyle of which she became accustomed to.  That's how they base the money. 
[02:37:00]  Yet there's no guarantee that you're going to be able to live the lifestyle you're accustomed  to.  And you can't fuck her anymore.  I was accustomed to getting blown and having my ass eaten.  Right.  Get in there.  On top of that, she'll receive.  Get in that nasty stink crater.  Exactly.  Open that fucking, been traveled 480,000 round trip miles.  That fucking swamp ass.  That cranky ass he must have had.  Space swamp ass.  He came back.  Oh, moon ass.  It's been in the fucking space suit for two weeks.  Crater filled ass.  Yes.  It gets better for her. 
[02:37:30]  On top of that, she'll receive $9,500 a month in spousal support.  Plus 30% of his money.  And 30% of Aldrin's annual income, which tops about $600,000.  Why does he have to pay her by the fucking month if she's getting a piece of his money?  So she's going to get close to $200,000 a year plus, plus the $9,500 a month.  Wow.  Wait, is that?  Wow.  It says end.  Terrible.  $9,500 a month.  Wow.  That's like just a given.  That's $118,000 and change. 
[02:38:00]  $119,000.  He got the stuttering lawyer from fucking my cousin Vinny.  Right.  That's a bad lawyer.  She's going to get $119,000 plus 30% of his annual income.  That's another about $200,000.  Oh, my God.  So she's going to get $318,000.  Let's call it $318,000 a year.  He only makes $600,000.  How's he making that at 82, by the way?  What's he doing?  Probably speaking.  It's like I always say, you can't win for losing.  But officially, she's making more than 50% of his money. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, that's fucked.  Of his annual income.  What a bitch.  Oh, at 82.  And she never left the planet.  He left the planet.  What an asshole judge.  You'd think the judge would go, oh, fuck.  Wait, you're the guy that walked on the moon?  That guy.  Maybe he refused to sign the judge's napkin.  Yeah, maybe he was a prick.  He wouldn't take a picture of it.  Now.  Cannon even gets to keep her 1988 Mercedes, which bears the ironic moon gal plates. 
[02:39:00]  It says moon gal.  Moon gal.  So she was sapping off his fucking fans.  Tension whore.  Oh, God.  Moon gal.  How about this?  No kids.  And no kids.  And she's still getting home.  And how about this?  He was the one who filed for divorce.  Oh, brother.  Second guy to walk on the moon, of course.  Yeah.  He signed for divorce.  God.  That is brutal.  Does not seem right at all.  Yes.  What was his first words on the moon?  Fuck.  Fucking cunt wife. 
[02:39:30]  I shouldn't be first.  That cunt.  Yeah.  I love it up here.  There's no blood sucking whores on this planet.  This rock.  Ah.  Fucking cunt.  We read you.  We read you, Buzz.  I like to think Neil Armstrong distracted Buzz.  Like it was every man for themselves.  And he was just smarter.  Made him go, hey, look at, you know, over there.  Buzz, you want to check that switch over there?  I think so.  The light's on.  Is that light blinking over there?  He's just scurrying down the ladder.  What's wrong with the family?  I'm trying to leave back on, man.  Gotcha.  No max, no max, no penny tax. 
[02:40:00]  He tricked him with some easy shit.  Like, go over there and hit that moon switch.  The what?  You know, out the hatchet.  The moon switch.  You know, I was reading something about spacewalking yesterday.  Totally unrelated.  And they were talking about the guys who did the first spacewalks outside the craft over  the earth.  Extra vehicular activities.  Yes.  The EVA.  And they said it's called, you get like this space euphoria. 
[02:40:30]  And the guy did not want to get back in the capsule.  He's like, you can't comprehend what it was, I guess.  And they kept saying, come back in.  And you're like, all right, a minute, a minute, in a minute.  And he was like, they were having a hard time getting him back in.  He got the space madness, Stimpy.  And then it took 25 minutes to get back in.  Wow.  Because he couldn't bend his legs or something to get through the, so he had to go and head  first.  And they had orders, if he can't get in, to cut him loose.  Whoa.  Wow.  I forget who that was.  But there's a real thing, when you're floating out there, it's got to be amazing to float  in space.  It really does. 
[02:41:00]  It would be sick to just look.  Because there's nothing around.  There's the ship, but everywhere else is just, boo, it's open.  I wonder if that's even better than walking on the moon.  Like, walking on the moon is amazing, but to float in space?  You're on the moon.  You still have some kind of relative ground to sky.  Your tubsies, yeah.  You know, there's something relatable there.  When you're just floating in space, I would assume it's something that you can't describe  to anybody.  Yeah, you can.  You should go scuba diving. 
[02:41:30]  Really?  It's a lot like that.  Yeah.  If you go into some deeper waters.  Sharks in space, they're open.  I know.  You've got to know your instruments, because you really, there comes a time every once in  a while where you're not really sure which way he's up.  I would guess that is.  But again, there's a definite bottom and top.  There's an up and down, which you do not have in space at all.  It really all blends in if you go a little deeper, I'm telling you.  It's all good.  He was coming in.  I'm sure it's not the same.  It's all good.  Just don't touch the starfish.  Obviously, it's not the same as floating in space, but you do get that idea. 
[02:42:00]  Like, you think, you know, up is this way, and they're like, no, that's actually sideways.  Well, they trained those guys in a pool, in the water.  Right.  They trained them in the water.  It is similar to a point.  And when he was going back into the hatch, he had to, to fit his legs, he had to decompress  the space suit a little bit, which was okay, but they said it was very dangerous, and it  was like when you come up from the water too fast, you get the bends.  So there are some similarities.  Yeah, yeah, the pressure shit.  You float, and look down at the earth, and be, and like have this blackness. 
[02:42:30]  It's like, that's probably what the, you're looking at the earth.  That's fucked up on the moon too, because they were talking about being on the moon and  looking at a full earth, or a half earth, because it's, you know, relative to the moon,  that's the moon, it's looking at earth.  That's gotta be fucked up.  The sheer distance you are away from it.  I mean, when you go on a trip, and you're, you know, the other side of the country, or Australia,  it's like people go, Jesus Christ, I was so far away, it took hours to get there.  When you look at the fucking earth, and it's in the sky, that's far away from home. 
[02:43:00]  That's gotta play with your fucking head.  I'm sorry, I don't care who you are.  You gotta constantly be thinking, if this fucking thing doesn't work perfectly, I am so fucked.  Am I hitting the launch button and just click, click, and now you're on the moon.  Someone, going around yesterday, they had that, it's a different form of the video we saw  originally of, it's a gif actually that keeps changing to show how small earth really is.  Oh god, yeah.  Holy fuck.  And there are just giant things out there. 
[02:43:30]  Yeah.  My cock.  Oh, sorry.  Like, Saturn and Jupiter alone, they're how many times...  The gas giants.  But how many times bigger are they than earth?  Six billion trillion gazillion.  Six billion.  If I may use a technical jargon.  Yeah, yeah.  Jupiter's a thousand earths.  A thousand.  And the sun is a thousand Jupiters.  And then they get way bigger than that.  Oh yeah, our sun is shit.  Oh yeah, it's not fun.  Our sun is the fucking Jan Brady of suns.  A million earths.  A million earths in the sun.  Yeah.  A thousand, thousand.  What? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, of course.  Is it really a million?  Yeah, a million earths.  A million earths fit in the sun.  A million?  But I wouldn't recommend it because it's very hot.  Oh my God.  Very hot.  You lose count after 849,221, you gotta start over again.  Take all the earths out.  Start over.  There's one...  Of course there's life out there.  There's one star...  Of course.  Where they said if you got into a jetliner and flew at cruising altitude speed, it would  take you a thousand years to go around at once. 
[02:44:30]  It's a big fucking...  Or is that our sun?  That might be our sun or it was a sun.  It's probably our sun because that doesn't even seem that fucking big.  I wish I could find that...  We'll be right back with more vague space knowledge.  I didn't watch that show.  That would be a great show.  Vague space knowledge.  Yeah, I think it is.  It's something like that.  How far is Jupiter?  Might be.  I'm not sure, but it's big.  Let's write up the treatment for discovery.  Very vague.  Vague space knowledge.  It would take you like 7,000 light years just to get halfway to the side of it. 
[02:45:00]  Maybe.  Right?  I'll check that.  Google it.  Lot of shit out there.  Lot of shit.  Although, I find the subatomic level to be just as interesting.  Yes, yes.  Not many people really give it much thought.  But now they find that they're fucking...  They're saying that particles can be in two places at once. 
[02:45:30]  What?  It's really weird.  And that, like, they had this...  I've talked about this before.  I can't describe the test they do.  Yeah, I remember that one.  But there's the one where the particle, when they shoot it through something, it kind of...  It splits and becomes more.  But then when you try to look at it, measure it as just one or...  Yes!  It's almost like the act of observing it wrecks what it was doing.  It's really fucking weird.  The Hadron Collider?  No.  Oh, the Hadron, yeah.  It's old hat.  I run faster than that goddamn thing. 
[02:46:00]  It's so slow.  I'll race you.  Hey, you want a collider?  You drive on the LIA.  What the heck do I know?  Oh, boy, regular Joe.  Regular Joe.  Well, what do I know in space?  That's what I took up in school.  Take us out, pig.  Regular Joe physics.  Yeah.  Yeah, you want your physics?  I don't know.  You give me two apples, make it orange.  Then I'm impressed.  Well, you know what?  This regular Joe, there's no stopping him.  He really knows a lot.  He really makes it easy to understand.  There's nothing stopping him except 11th grade on up. 
[02:46:30]  I love vague space knowledge.  We'll be right back with more vague space knowledge.  Because it's shit everyone.  You've seen shows on it.  Even in school, you learned a little bit of it.  But you didn't really retain all of it.  What are you trying to recite when you're heard?  It's just hard.  I know it was something.  It's big.  Remember Sagan?  Carl Sagan.  Carl Sagan, yes.  Was it Cosmos when we were kids?  Cosmos.  Yeah.  They truly thought we only had 12 planets? 
[02:47:00]  Well, no.  We supposedly had nine planets.  But in our lifetime.  But then they took away Pluto.  Now we only have eight planets.  It's been downgraded from planet to lump of shit.  Yeah.  So fuck you.  We were so stupid to think that's all that was out there.  It was ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So going to school was a waste of time for all of us.  At this age, going to school was a waste of time.  Yeah.  We really didn't know much.  All our knowledge is wrong. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  Very little knowledge.  At least we knew that we weren't the center of the universe.  Because that was wrong.  Yeah.  Those idiots.  That was wrong.  Copernicus.  Copernicus.  And then if you said, no, you know, we're just, the sun is the center of our solar system,  not the universe.  And we go around that.  Why are you cutting my head off?  Why?  Why are you burning me?  Ow!  I'm just trying to teach.  But then all this.  I'm not a witch.  Yeah.  They just fucking didn't want to hear it.  Then all this new shit that we know is going to be blown away someday.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:48:00]  That's skinks.  That's why it all comes back to that whole religious angle and shit.  Like, if books about factual things were completely wrong back then, the earth is flat and, you  know, we're the center of the universe and the world sits on a tortoise's back and we  like, but we're supposed to believe all the other shit, horse shit that came out back  then.  Every word.  Yeah.  Every word is supposed to be taken up as gospel.  Yeah.  That's a little weird.  So the arc thing is totally accurate. 
[02:48:30]  What do you think there, Regula Joe?  Yeah.  What do I know?  Staten Island Ferry is the arc to me as far as I'm concerned.  Two of every Tom, Dick, and Harry.  I think Regula Joe.  Oh, I don't hate hanging out with him.  I know.  Oh, you're just trying to fucking, and he's always mouthing off about stupid shit.  Just a buzzkill.  You don't care.  What a fucking lunk.  Just ending every conversation with a bad uncle line.  Oh, yeah.  Just, ugh. 
[02:49:00]  Huh?  Oh.  Oh, huh?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, there's Morgan Freeman as a documentary on the Science Fiction Channel.  Morgan Freeman.  Oh.  He looks ridiculous with that dumb earring.  Stop it, you fucking Ed Bradley head.  He's trying to be dainty with that earring.  Oh, it's awful.  Yeah.  Yeah, that doesn't quite pan out.  It shows I'm an artist.  But it's called A Show About Nothing, where he examines nothingness.  Wait a minute.  No, it examines nothingness.  It's a science film, yeah.  Where there's different, on the Sci-Fi Channel, different episodes of him narrating all these  cool scientific shows.  It's really good. 
[02:49:30]  I watched a couple of them last night.  I narrate everything.  Speaking of nothingness, Andy Dufresne had nothing in his hiney until they got a hold  of him.  The sisters.  There's nothing I don't narrate.  I'm Morgan Freeman.  Quintessential narrator of everything.  Heck him an actor, that guy.  Take that.  I narrate Vanilla Ice in his home instruction program.  Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. 
[02:50:00]  Dun, dun.  As you can see here, it's completely different.  Some said it was the same song.  Vanilla Ice crawled through a mile of his shit music.  To get to another song that wasn't a hit.  When is our guest coming?  I'm soon.  A few minutes.  Who's coming?  And what's the movie about?  What's Mo Mama about?  It's something.  It's a horror movie.  It's about, I guess, a little girl that goes missing. 
[02:50:30]  And I've only seen trailers, but she goes missing.  I hate that movie.  Yeah, like Mama.  I said, it's Uncle.  God damn you.  Tell your parents you were smoking.  Then we'll see.  They're in trouble.  And the girl comes back.  She was living in the woods for five years as a kid.  Oh, okay.  I saw that.  And then she was raised by some fucking weird thing.  And she comes back.  And the mother comes back. 
[02:51:00]  Yes, Mama.  Raised by wolves?  Oh.  No, I think, but it's kind of raised by something fucked up.  Yeah, something evil.  I fucking hate you for that trailer yesterday.  Holy shit.  The Evil Dead.  The new Evil Dead remake.  That was great.  We saw the scariest trailer, I think, ever.  Really?  I'm going to bring a girl with me to see that.  And when the monster comes out, I'm going to go, touch my pekka.  You haven't seen the Evil Dead trailer yet that Anne turned us on to yesterday.  And I found out yesterday.  Search it out today.  Holy fuck.  No CGI effects in that movie.  That's the work. 
[02:51:30]  It's all done.  They said it was all done with your old style, real life shit.  And so that face looking out of the thing, I thought they had CGI in her eyes or something  because they looked all scary.  Oh, good for them, man.  No, they're going like old school.  That shit still works.  That old school shit.  Scary shit, man.  Do we have a minute?  Can I get a piss?  Oh, this guy.  Look, look.  The Evil Dead shouldn't be redone.  Shut up.  What the fuck is it?  No, it's a really Gone with the Wind.  What do they call it?  It's like a re-telling. 
[02:52:00]  It's not re-imagining.  I think it would be one of those, yeah.  It looks like a completely different movie.  The first was scary, though.  The original had a horrifying...  Which is like, hee, hee, hee.  That girl laughing and rocking.  And then the scissors in the...  What made that so scary?  There's an atmosphere in certain movies.  I don't know.  I was thinking you're going to get scissors to your eyeballs while you're sleeping.  Alone in the Woods is very scary.  Tree Rape rules.  Tree Rape.  Tree Rape, yeah.  The Roots.  I hate the Woods.  The Woods are the Woods.  I always think I like the Woods.  I'm in the Woods. 
[02:52:30]  What?  The Woods suck.  What?  Especially the type of Woods where it's like one in the afternoon and it's already dark.  Right.  Yes.  God, I hate it.  The trees are turning on you.  Every shadow looks like something.  Like, how is this fun?  Then you're wondering where the fucking monsters are, the bears and shit.  They're all out there.  That's why it was exciting drinking in the woods because it was that element of fear.  Yeah.  But you could see the lights from like a house somewhere.  Right.  Yeah.  Long Island.  I wasn't really in the forest.  Right. 
[02:53:00]  You know, you go in the middle of the woods to drink and you're seeing like people's backyards  and shit like that.  The woods was really a patch.  We made a place called the Corral.  Nice.  And we, you know, you get some fucking big logs and set them up in a, it was a triangular  pattern and a big fire in the middle and we would just all sit on the, the wood and just  fucking drink, drink our Jack Daniels.  We'd all get little pints and half pints of Jack Daniels and a six pack of beer, like  each.  And we'd just sit there smoking our cigarettes and drinking a whiskey and telling bullshit  stories about girls we wanted to, but never fucked. 
[02:53:30]  But it wasn't the woods.  Huh?  It really wasn't the woods though.  No, to us back then it was the woods.  You were out in the fucking woods.  You didn't have to go far.  Yeah.  It was the woods.  There's trees around us.  You were being men in the woods.  Dirt, leaves.  Right.  Dirt and leaves.  That's all you need.  The woods.  The woods.  The woods.  Go to the Corral.  I'll meet you at the Corral later.  At the Corral.  And there wasn't any fucking texting anyone or calling them.  Yeah.  You gotta be like, hey, I'm going to the Corral tonight.  If plans change, you're fucked. 
[02:54:00]  How much did it suck though when you thought they might be at the Corral?  You make the trip and like, oh fuck, they're not at the Corral.  Alone at the Corral.  Search your friends out.  I'm going to go.  That was awesome.  I'm going to go check.  Find them.  I'm going to go check Jones Beach.  All right, man.  I'm going to.  Let's go fuck.  You spent half your day trying to find the people to hang out with.  They might be behind Leahy.  Let's go behind Leahy's school and find them.  Oh fuck, they're not behind Leahy.  Fuck, man.  Where is everybody tonight?  Maybe the girl man.  Did they go to the fucking 55 cent theater?  Maybe they went to see the Doors movie.  Maybe they're playing pinball at the bowling.  I'm going to go to people's pub. 
[02:54:30]  I think maybe they're playing foosball.  Fuck, where is everybody?  Damn it.  Is there a party or something?  What's going on?  There's supposed to be a party.  What the fuck?  Yeah, I hear.  And then there's always hearsay.  Right.  You had a fucking decode.  You'd fucking pull up and see some guy that you kind of knew.  Right.  You seen fucking Frank and Joe, man?  Where the fuck are they?  No, I haven't seen them.  Fuck.  Where is everybody?  Fucking Saturday night.  I'm fucking not hanging out with anybody.  Sucks.  I bet they were chicks.  And you're thinking like they're having the time of their lives. 
[02:55:00]  They're all getting blowjobs and drinking fucking champagne.  They're all home.  Meanwhile, they're just driving.  Yeah, they're either home.  Everyone's just missing each other.  Yeah.  They're just a little behind them.  You little fuckers don't know what it was like.  It was cool, though.  If you didn't have your plans made earlier in the day, it was fucking, yeah, it was a detective.  You'd have to go out and find them.  Clues.  Word of mouth.  You had to have your shit together when you finally decided, I'm stepping out of my house.  That's right.  Yes.  You had to have it.  You had to plan.  You had to have six hours planned out.  Yes. 
[02:55:30]  There was no changing on the go.  Nope.  Nope.  You had to make sure you had all your info.  Okay.  I think this is happening, but we're going to go here first.  My friend and I got CBs in our car.  Oh, nice.  And it was like so insane.  No, it made sense, though.  We're all the Dairy Queen.  We're all the Dairy Queen.  What was your handle?  I don't remember.  Oh, everyone remembers their handle.  I don't remember mine.  What was your handle, you nerd?  Come on.  Tom's embarrassed.  Oh, well, we're looking at the...  Wait, wait.  I don't remember mine.  I do. 
[02:56:00]  Nope.  Diamond Dust.  Diamond Dust.  Opie was Diamond Dust.  I was the Wrangler.  The Wrangler heading to the corral.  Yeah, the Wrangler.  Diamond Dust or Wrangler, which is worse?  Be honest.  They're both horrendous.  Diamond Dust or Wrangler.  You got the Wrangler.  I'm 10-10-10-8.  What do you have?  Diamond Dust.  I'm a Wrangler of the rump variety.  You should have done that joke before.  I'm sure you have.  Diamond Dust I've never heard, though.  Yeah, Diamond Dust.  What is Diamond Dust?  I don't know.  Gay. 
[02:56:30]  Girl Handle.  Yeah, that is girly.  Exactly.  What was Foxy Lady taking?  How about Pink Pixie?  You couldn't...  Sparkly Unicorn sign-up.  Sparkly Unicorn.  I hate being in here with no defense.  Diamond Dust designer jeans.  Where's my defense lawyer?  I need a defense lawyer.  There's nothing I can say.  It's hilarious.  I don't even remember what it's based on or anything anymore.  I thought it was cool.  Yes, I did.  You thought it was cool.  You thought Diamond Dust. 
[02:57:00]  Wait, man.  Diamond Dust here.  Oh, that's so bad.  What a good idea, though, having it in your car, though, if you're fucking looking for your  friends.  You can hook up with your friends.  Yeah.  But then you thought you were using it illegally.  You were scared.  Oh, fuck.  I'm supposed to have it licensed with the FCC.  I don't know if you could just say I'm going to Dairy Queen.  What channel are we supposed to be on?  Please stay off this channel.  It's for...  This is emergency.  It's Channel 9.  What are you doing on this channel?  You're not supposed to be on this channel. 
[02:57:30]  Fuck you.  Diamond Dust.  I can go where I want.  I'm Diamond Dust, damn it.  If people would have private conversations on those and no one could hear them,  Yeah.  Yeah, they would.  There was a lot of shit you'd hear late at night.  You'd hear, like, the guys that would be like,  Man, I say my name, I ain't single, I'm all fucking Italian.  And they were from the South, like, gather.  Convoys.  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess.  You couldn't hear them.  But it was like, you'd get skip, I guess, off the atmosphere.  And you'd hear shit from, like, overseas sometimes. 
[02:58:00]  Oh, wow.  Real late at night.  Skip off the atmosphere.  Yeah.  Real weird.  God, you remember...  Who's skip off the atmosphere?  Wasn't he on Real, Oh, That's Incredible or Real People?  No, that was Skip.  Skip.  Stevenson.  Stevenson.  You felt so cool when you got one of those skips in your life.  Yeah, yeah.  Hearing from faraway lawns, like Albany, New York.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That faraway fucking destination.  But back then, I was like, holy fuck, really?  Poughkeepsie, wow.  Wow.  This is crazy.  The bottom of the ocean or the deepest parts of space and go. 
[02:58:30]  What's the question?  That's the question, which is cooler, more interesting.  Oh, God.  Space.  Space.  The final frontier.  These are the voyages.  Space.  Space.  Nah, too much distance in between everything.  Yeah, but you're still up there.  You're still floating.  Yeah, but then you don't see anything.  Yeah, but you can't sing the song in the bottom of the ocean.  What's the song?  I'm in space and you're not.  The songs are very short.  These songs are terrible. 
[02:59:00]  That was on the fly.  Yeah, no, I think being in space, because technically anybody on the planet can go into  the ocean somehow.  Oh, right.  And with the right, you know, space is a motherfucker.  Yeah.  Not so special.  Although James Cameron went to the very bottom by himself at the deepest place.  There's some weird shit down there.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He didn't see much, though.  See slugs.  He didn't see much?  No.  See cucumbers.  He picked up the bad spot.  Seeing them in enemies.  Well, he went down too low, I think.  He was in the Marianas Trench.  He went down there in a submersible, and there was a lot of kick up of silt. 
[02:59:30]  A lot of silt.  Oh, is that what it was?  Yes.  And I think one of his lights were broken.  How long does it take for that shit to settle back down?  Oh, man.  A little longer than you want to be down there, I'm sure.  Plus, your motors are still going.  He wasn't tied by a string, was he?  Yeah, yeah.  A string.  A string.  I love Jimmy.  Yeah, I do believe that it's not a...  I think it's on a cable.  It's a string.  Yeah.  I don't think it was...  It breaks.  I don't think it was a regular silt. 
[03:00:00]  Imagine if you're...  Oh, God.  And then you feel the bottom, and then you see yourself tipping forward.  Oh, my God.  Face down in the bottom of the trench.  Ready to return.  You're dead.  You're done.  Or the motor doesn't work.  That has to fucking wind you back up.  Oh, God.  You have to just get out and swim.  Yeah, I guess you would have to give it a shot.  Swim.  Oh, my God.  Swim.  Start swimming.  Now, take a deep breath.  The deepest breath you've ever taken.  Go deeper than that.  It's like holding your breath for the height of Mount Everest. 
[03:00:30]  I could do that.  Yeah?  Could you...  You'd think you'd feel it once the water flooded and it was so fat?  No.  It'd be so fat.  Supposedly, it's the fastest death, like, ever.  What is?  The bends or the crushing?  No, the crushing.  You would be eliminated instantly.  You wouldn't even know.  You wouldn't even know.  You'd be crushed by tons of water.  You'd just collapse like a water bottle.  Oh, just...  Well, why does the water crush you?  If you pour it on your head, it goes everywhere else.  It's very healthy.  Well, if it didn't have anywhere to go, it gets very heavy. 
[03:01:00]  Right.  And on itself...  That water's heavy.  That column of water...  Let's say on your head, let's eight inches by eight inches square up thousands of feet  of water, how heavy that would be.  Now that's all over you, pushing everywhere on your body.  Yeah.  That's fucking heavy.  Fuck yeah.  You can't even open the top like a thick puppy.  Figuratively and literally heavy.  Yo, we got our guest or what?  What?  What happened?  Where's a bottle of water for the star Anthony Cumia? 
[03:01:30]  I already drank out of it.  I don't want that one.  You want it?  I'll take it when it comes out.  I need a water, too.  You piss on me, Jimmy.  Yeah, I got it.  All right.  And I agree.  I got some backwash here.  No, why isn't there water?  The fucking show gets water.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  I tell you, that is really frightening.  You want a water, I'll toss you one.  You're two feet away from me.  That was scary.  I want cold water.  You like it cold?  I like it room temperature.  We can discuss that for five minutes.  I need icy cold water.  But why are we getting any contact out in space? 
[03:02:00]  Why isn't one thing...  Why not one contact?  One.  Something.  A noise.  A something.  Because space is huge.  Yeah, that shit is so far away.  It's just vast.  How long have we had the ability to intercept sounds?  We've only had the ability in our little area of the universe.  That's the problem.  And it's only been for about 40 years.  The only thing we can do is send it out and only at the speed of light.  Right, so 40 light years.  So it takes 40 light years.  That's nothing.  Andromeda, our neighbor galaxy is 2 million light years. 
[03:02:30]  Yeah, so we're 40 away.  That's the problem.  Great.  Whoop-dee-fucking-do.  Right.  We're just...  40 light years.  They're just scratching the surface.  Maybe they are, but we don't have any way of receiving.  A receiver, a transmitter, can only be heard with a receiver.  So what are we supposed to be receiving?  They might be sending it, you know, that the blades of grass can understand.  The blades of grass are going, hey, there's life on another planet.  I don't think so.  And we're like, ah, we don't speak that.  It's terrible.  We don't know that language. 
[03:03:00]  Wasn't there a thing where it was...  Where there was...  We did receive some kind of change in sound for like a day.  Maybe.  We actually did receive something, but we couldn't translate it.  Really?  Yeah.  It was this program.  It was probably something else.  It was probably space noise.  An anomaly.  Was it an anomaly?  Anomaly.  It was...  It was something else.  Anomaly.  Exactly.  Probably just a rock hitting the side of it or something.  We're so alone.  Space trick.  We really are.  We really are.  We're alone in this part of the universe, but there's a shitload of life out there. 
[03:03:30]  But until we know there is one other thing...  Well, we've got to go further.  ...it doesn't mean that there is another thing.  Right.  Like, we could be such an oddity that we are...  Impossible.  ...in all of this space.  It's not impossible.  Then that means there's a God.  But why would God only give us the ability of life?  I've often said, and this is true, if there is one of something, it does not necessarily mean  there is another.  If there are two of something, it means there is probably more.  What have you said that?  I've never heard you say that. 
[03:04:00]  I've quoted as saying that every week, I say it.  Have you ever heard Anthony say that?  Yes, if there's one of something, there should be 50.  One shot on the bar.  Shot at tequila.  But it is true, my friend.  Just because we're here does not mean there is another form of life in the universe, or  especially a form of life that is equivalent to this.  Oh, yeah.  There could be some form of life that we don't even fucking understand, would never communicate 
[03:04:30]  with.  Do you think it satisfies us at all if you find traces of water on Mars?  Does that mean anything?  Sure.  It doesn't really have impact.  Yes, it absolutely means something.  Yeah, it, it, because then it's.  Of course they're going to find that.  Those building blocks of life.  They're going to find that.  But it doesn't have that divine little spark that happened here that made people.  Oh, that's Jesus.  No, but it shows.  It could be.  It could be.  It's Jesus talking.  Thank you, sir.  It shows that it's.  Why wouldn't they do that in other places?  Yeah.  If you got the universe and you're the God guy, why wouldn't you go life?  You go everywhere.  I think it was the.  Why would you just pick one tiny little part of the universe? 
[03:05:00]  Primordial ooze.  You add a little heat.  You add a little fucking magic special fucking star powdery stuff.  Diamond dust.  Diamond dust, as we like to call himself.  And before you know it, you've got some kind of life form that evolves into what we are  now.  Doesn't mean it happened anywhere else.  But there's endless combinations out there.  So there's going to be another combination where that is possible.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  No maybes.  I don't know. 
[03:05:30]  It's happening.  Or it did happen.  Why don't we have anything?  It is currently happening.  No sign.  No nothing.  Not a goddamn word.  Nothing.  Not a text.  Because.  Maybe it's like us talking to a fucking cricket where they just look at us and go,  ugh, shut up.  Why bother with them?  I don't.  I wouldn't kneel down and talk to an ant on the ground.  Why are these fucking.  I don't want to talk to one in here.  Hey, they call me ant.  Oh, Jimmy.  Wait a minute.  Because it's because of our self-important stupid brains. 
[03:06:00]  Yes, we think we're right.  We think we're way bigger than we are.  When that dumb video that's going around shows how tiny, teeny, weeny Earth is.  We think Earth is everything.  We stink as a fucking race, as a planet.  It's our frontal lobe.  Britches.  Yeah.  Ah, too big for our britches.  Ah, way to sum it all up.  You use that one a lot.  Didn't you use that with the laborer that wasn't sweeping up on the job site the other  day?  That's right.  It's too big for his britches.  That's right.  I worked my way up.  I worked my way up.  Pushing a broom. 
[03:06:30]  That's his generation.  Now look at me now.  I'm heading up the drywall installation here.  I dealt with too many regular Joes in real life to find this funny, Jimmy.  Not into the regular Joes thing.  It was not funny when I had to work with them, and it's not funny now.  Do you think regular Joes is an ass?  Regular Joes is a douche.  Regular Joes kept me from having a lot of fun over the years.  Oh, Sprout.  I'm having some conflict with the ex. 
[03:07:00]  Oh, no.  Over Sprout.  Oh, she doesn't like Sprout?  He hates.  Who would like Sprout?  He's adorable.  No.  Sprout is not adorable.  Jimmy's newest character.  I haven't heard Sprout.  There's not much to him yet.  He's getting there.  Sprout is very innocent, very naive, very young, very, you know.  Oh, golly.  Oh, he sounds delightful.  Yeah, real fucking delight.  Does he turn everything into a positive?  No, he's not that way. 
[03:07:30]  No?  No.  Go fuck yourself.  Oh, gee, Ant.  Hey, we're going to have to fucking talk to him off the air about fucking...  I really do have to go.  You do?  Yeah, I got to go.  Oh, he's on his way up, Booker.  Oh, he's on his way up?  Should we break or we'll go?  No, why don't you do the read?  All right, let's go and do the read.  You know what?  I don't even want to do a read.  I just want to talk about Steven Singer and Steven Singer Jewelers.  You got to get the right gift for the right person.

[03:09:30]  Fucking place is going to go nuts.  He'll laugh hysterically.  You got to know that.  Hysterically, too.  Let's not be gender biased.  Well, of course.  Gender biased.  He's, yeah, I guess he's coming up.  I didn't know he was here in the past.  Did you talk to him at all or just say you wanted a picture?  He was doing another show.  Why was it?  Why didn't we talk to him then, I wonder?  I don't know.  I honestly don't remember why.  He might have come in too late.  When is Games of Thrones?  In March.  Starting up?  March?  31st.  March.  Hello, mates. 
[03:10:00]  Game of Thrones is coming out real soon.  Oh.  You're in his seat.  Yeah, I'm in Mama.  So nice to meet you.  I'm in a new horror movie.  You guys into it?  Game of Drones.  Sam, get me a Diablo sandwich and a Dr. Pepper.  Make it snappy.  He's in a goddamn hurry.  Yeah, exactly.  Yoo-hoo, Sheriff.  E-Rock comes out with toilet paper. 
[03:10:30]  Nice ass.  Nice ass.  Thank you, nice lady.  Yeah.  Sheriff.  Oh, Sheriff.  There's no one in the hallway.  There's no one out there.  What's it rolling?  There's no one at the check-in.  Is this them?  We're going to wind up going into Sam's after show time.  Oh, no.  And I don't like doing that.  Oh, the audience appreciates it.  How else would we have gotten into the whole Sal thing today?  If not for...  What's that, E-Rock?  I think the people who are left for Martha are just walking into the studio now. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, and there's signs all over that studio that says, future home of the Opie and Anthony  show.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We put those signs all over that studio.  So now they're going to go over there and be...  No, see, what we want to do is knock down this wall and take up both studios and have a giant  studio for us.  You should.  And that's our dicks.  Yeah.  You should.  It's a giant dicks.  Broken down.  Yeah.  You could have more guests.  It would help the show.  We could have a live audience in here again.  You could have musics if you want.  Right.  Make love to each other in a bigger space. 
[03:11:30]  Yes.  It would be fantastic.  That would...  You deserve it.  We do deserve it, but we're not going to get it.  But anyway, we put signs up all over that said, future home of the Opie and Anthony show.  So now the people go in there and they get very upset with us that we're honing in.  And there's a cartoon picture of Jim flipping the bird.  Flipping the bird.  Like, hey, fuck you.  We're taking your studio.  Where's Martha going?  Martha is Dunsky here at SiriusXM Satellite Radio.  Oh.  Love her.  Take your fucking...  Your souffle.  Hey.  Take your towels.  What?  And take your felonous ass out of here, you stock fucking... 
[03:12:00]  You inside info motherfucker.  Get your fucking...  Get your fucking souffle box.  It was Sharnbox.  I know, Jimmy.  Oh, okay, good.  I wasn't sure if that was too intellectual, a motherfucking...  It was a little intellectual.  I'll give you that one.  Martha's Dunn.  So, uh...  I like her.  Do you?  Yeah.  You ever worried you're really going to slip and maybe a sword goes into somebody?  Comment?  Yeah, we're...  Ah, yes.  We do a lot of training. 
[03:12:30]  We train a lot for the game.  What's that?  We use the hero sword when we're doing shots where we're not endangering anyone.  And then for the stunts, we use a soft sword.  I love Australians.  He's Australian.  I don't think he is either.  It's really good.  They always go up at the end, like to talk like this.  Rowan's blaming the elevators.  Remember, out on a boat, and a shark came up.  You don't believe he was coming up?  It was right off the reef.  Came into the boat.  Didn't know what to do. 
[03:13:00]  Okay, apparently he's coming back now.  What?  Rowan said, damn elevators.  They're stopping at every stop.  They'll do that.  Yeah, those elevators.  I bet he was stopping being like, hang out there.  I fucked up.  Wow.  Hey, elevators, you know, get your ups and downs.  Yeah.  Am I right?  Yeah, you sure do.  From your lips to God's ears.  I don't know nothing about this Game of Thrones.  You guys take care of this one.  What do I know?  Game of Thrones.  I don't have time for games. 
[03:13:30]  I got to feed the wife and kids.  That's stupid regular Joe.  Hey, what's that?  You're going to run around like a big bunch of crowns on your heads?  That's your business.  I'm working.  Doesn't understand the show or any fun or anything.  I couldn't make no heads and tails out of it.  You get me the Rockford Files.  Not nudity.  The Rockford Files.  Good episode of Canon.  Violence and nudity.  That's what I like.  Yeah, I don't know what this guy is.  You want to make pretend?  You do so on your own time.  Make pretend.  God, is this a good looking motherfucker.  Come on, I've been here every day. 
[03:14:00]  I know, Jimmy.  Come on in.  Take a seat, sir.  Take a seat.  Look at this.  A goddamn real star, Jimmy.  How are you?  Real star.  Hi, how are you?  Sir?  We're on the air.  Yeah, we're on the air.  We just let it fly, as they say.  Is the J silent?  Tom Papa.  Tom Papa.  You might recognize him from such movies as that one with the friggin' the guy where he  had the informant.  That guy.  Yeah.  That was a very good acting job by you. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, yeah.  I remember him.  Oh, yeah.  That guy.  That's, um...  Yeah.  Now, your movie, sir.  Yeah.  I've seen the trailers for this and stuff.  Haven't seen the movie yet.  No.  I want to try to get a screener, but I want to do it legally.  It looks very frightening.  This is one of these movies where things...  I don't like when things move like they don't move in nature.  Why is that scary?  But it is.  It is.  And then kids moving where you don't want that.  Like kids in scary movies.  Sure.  I don't know.  It freaks me out.  Yes.  Exactly.  All the way.  But when you think back to like The Shining.  Oh, The Shining. 
[03:15:00]  Things like that with those twins.  It's funny, isn't it?  Because I love The Shining.  I watch it again and again.  But every time it's just a horrible experience.  Because you just say, I know they're going to cut to those twins.  You know they're cutting.  They're going to cut to the twins.  And that's scary.  That would mess me up.  And they're probably adorable in real life.  But you surround anybody with blood and acts and it just gets...  It looks really frightening.  They try to burn it down.  But in real life, they were probably adorable little kids.  Yeah, yeah.  Cute little dresses.  Maybe not.  Maybe not.  What's the gist of the movie?  Like, I'm getting that this...  Well, the gist is you have these... 
[03:15:30]  Well, it opens up with this guy who's...  It's like, well...  You know, you read about these stories in the paper.  A guy loses it and he kills his family.  And, you know, that's how it starts.  And he takes off with these two kids.  And they disappear.  Then you cut to five to present day.  This is five years ago.  And his brother, his twin brother, Luke, has been searching for him.  And then they find, miraculously, they find these two girls that have been living in this cabin.  They survived.  And then he takes them in with his girlfriend. 
[03:16:00]  She doesn't want to, but he persuades her.  He's also guilt-ridden because his brother did what he did.  And, of course, the girls are traumatized and they bring something with them.  There's a reason they survived.  Oh, okay.  Well, you could kind of get, from the name of the movie, Mama, that there is something...  Overprotective mother.  ...that raised these kids and protected them and probably wants to continue protecting them.  Yeah, yeah.  It looks very, very scary. 
[03:16:30]  Have you done horror movies in the past?  No, no, no.  Not like this.  Yeah?  No.  Was it any difference between...  No, not really, no.  No, you just get out there and...  You just...  Yeah, no...  Does it really take away from it, though, that you're seeing how it's done?  I'm, you know, I'm pathetic that way.  When I watch, like, The Shining or even our movie, it still scares me.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, it goes back, go back to being a little kid.  I just hear the music going boom, boom, boom.  And I go, oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Here it comes.  I am a little fucking pussy when it comes to scary movies.  Oh, I'm just saying. 
[03:17:00]  What scared me so much when I saw it recently, I actually had to turn it off.  Uh, Stupid DeRosa recommended it.  It was, uh...  It's about the little kid, and he sees...  Yeah, we all know Stupid DeRosa.  Yeah, Joe DeRosa.  Hey, Stupid DeRosa!  That's stupid.  But you said his name right.  But the, uh...  It's the kid who kind of goes into a coma.  They think he's in a coma, but he's not.  He has just gone away internally.  Do you know where that...  No one knows that movie?  Oh, boy.  It was fucking frightening.  And I watched it on Netflix, and I'm like, eh, I gotta get up tomorrow. 
[03:17:30]  You know, me, it was Sunday.  I'm like, eh.  You didn't want to watch it on Netflix?  I turned it off to watch it the next day.  It bothered me so much, I had to turn it off.  I wish I could remember the name of that.  Yeah, it affected me.  A little Stupid DeRosa.  It scared me.  It was a frightening movie.  Damn that, Stupid DeRosa.  But then, during the day, when you're on your computer, you're like, oh, this is not frightening  at all.  You know, I manned up a little bit.  It's just...  There is some primal thing that happens at night.  Why is it that we want to go see these movies?  Why is it?  Because I don't understand.  Like the fear.  To get scared.  Yeah. 
[03:18:00]  And, like I said, at night, you get this thing.  Why do you want to get scared?  I don't know.  It's fun to have an emotion pulled out of you.  To have something pulled out of you is nice.  Yeah?  Yeah, I think so.  Better than that basketball trophy.  See, Jim, I'm implying what you did.  Oh, God.  Yeah, that's terrible.  I don't know, but we do like that.  Well, sad movies.  You know, it pulls out the...  Comedies?  The sad thing.  Comedy.  And I guess that's just another way of kind of living vicariously through the screen and 
[03:18:30]  getting scared.  No, but when I watch it, I feel sick.  I actually sit there and go, oh, why am I doing this?  Why am I doing this to myself?  And, of course, then you leave and you're like, oh, you're so relieved.  But then you go, oh, no, I'm going to have dreams about this.  Yeah.  I'm going to look out the window and it's going to be dark now.  Maybe it's like that eternal fear of dying and then you sit there and you go through that  whole thing.  But, you know, deep down, you know, I'm still safe.  I'm still here.  I'm still safe.  I'm just watching it.  Just a movie.  It's like looking at an accident you're not in.  I made it.  Yeah, true.  Yeah, yeah.  Kind of nice to see. 
[03:19:00]  You get that visceral kind of feeling from it.  It's so twisted and wrong.  You went there to traffic accidents.  I know, right?  But you know what I mean?  We all look at it for that really weird reason.  There's something in nature which makes you look.  No, don't include me.  It's like looking at the dead hooker in the bathtub.  Right?  Am I right, guys?  You with me?  Yeah.  Hey, look, she shouldn't have backed up into the coat hanger.  I didn't.  What are you going to do?  But we all look at it.  They said in nature, there's a really weird thing when you see somebody in distress, you  look at it because you're trying to process how to avoid that.  That's why in nature, it's not just voyeurism. 
[03:19:30]  We want to know how do we avoid that horrible thing happening.  I don't like thinking that deeply into it.  I just like either getting petrified or laughing at a movie.  I'm a simple man, Jim.  Are you scared by slasher stuff, though?  No.  The gore stuff doesn't do it, but the suspense.  That's annoying.  That gets a little annoying.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  The thing is, once you invest in the characters, then it's just horrible because you know,  just don't go in there.  Yeah, what are you doing?  Look at those kids.  They're horrible. 
[03:20:00]  Don't take them in.  Don't take them in.  You don't need this in your life.  And the girlfriend was trying to like, oh, what are you doing?  Yeah, well, that's like, yeah.  She was like, don't do that.  We have a great life.  What are you doing?  I'm messed up.  Did you shoot it in a spooky place?  Toronto, yeah.  That's spooky.  The spookiness of Toronto.  Yes.  They're up in the CN Tower.  Was it supposed to be another city?  Yeah.  Like how Toronto is never Toronto in movies?  It was never said in America, yeah. 
[03:20:30]  Poor Toronto is like, hey, we get a lot of movies made here.  It's great.  Yeah, we're not going to call it Toronto.  We're not going to call it Toronto.  We're not going to call it.  Yeah, yeah.  We're going to call it anything but Toronto.  Well, I think Pittsburgh, they have to call it Pittsburgh because like Jack Reacher was  in Pittsburgh and there was another one that was because they get big tax breaks for  shooting movies there.  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  So Pittsburgh is smart, but they always say they're in Pittsburgh.  That's probably in the contract.  You have to mention that you're in Pittsburgh.  Yeah.  Silly.  When's Game of Thrones come back?  Oh, man.  March 31st.  Yeah.  Wow.  Were you surprised at how it took off and really got popular? 
[03:21:00]  Of course, yeah.  It's amazing.  I mean, I was excited when I read the script, but part of me also went, how the hell are  they going to shoot this?  Yeah, right?  It's epic.  This is insane.  Yeah.  Huge.  But they pulled it off.  Really clever guys.  It really is amazing how big the production is.  And you look at it and go, I don't know how they can afford to make this.  No.  It must not pay you a lot.  No.  That's what sunk up.  I think Rome cost a lot of money.  It was either Rome or Rome. 
[03:21:30]  It was Rome.  Rome was two seasons.  That cost so much, and it was a great show, but this is a much bigger show.  Game of Thrones is a good show.  Yeah.  It's nice to hear people talking about a show again.  You overhear conversations about it.  That's how you know a show is going to be around for a while.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  Do you like playing a villain more than a good guy?  I imagine that would be more fun.  Well, you know, when you think of Jamie Lannister, I don't even think of him as a villain.  He's a good guy.  I heard one kiss.  He's a better brother than I am. 
[03:22:00]  I don't even going to go there.  It took you in.  That was so bad.  Yeah.  Okay, now I got the whole jest of it.  Right.  Now you're settling in, realizing what the hell you got yourself into.  Slowly moving his chair away from Jimmy.  But he is, I mean, he's a survivor.  No, but the funny thing is, if you think about it, I mean, I know he's banging his sister  and it is twisted.  But actually, it is the only, you know, he actually, he loves this girl. 
[03:22:30]  Yes.  And that's the only, in a way, true love on the show.  Everyone else has arranged marriages and has been put together for political reasons.  He actually wants to be with this girl.  And, of course, it's a mess.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a mess.  Yeah.  And he does some horrible things.  Yeah, he's not a good guy, but I don't think he's a bad guy.  Really?  Pushing the kid out the window.  There was a great moment, too, in last season when you had that, and you were in the cage.  Oh, my God.  And the guy wants to help you.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you can help me.  You don't give away that anything bad's going to happen. 
[03:23:00]  It's so great the way you play that.  It's good writing.  Yeah, the movie, the show itself does that where you won't expect things.  Yeah.  And things happen.  You're like, what?  Yeah.  They can't have just done that.  How are they going to undo that?  Right.  It's, uh, the writing's amazing.  The characters are great.  There's no character that's one-dimensional.  I mean, they all have that fucking, we were just talking about Joffrey, that little fucking  prick.  What a hateable little character. 
[03:23:30]  The most hateable one is the most hateable character.  Isn't it funny?  It's great.  Jack plays him, this Irish kid.  I mean, you're not going to believe he studies theology at Trinity College in Dublin.  He's in the top 1%.  He's the sweetest, gentlest man.  He gets in front of the camera and he just turns into this.  He is a little, because he's like every teenager you hate.  I know.  He's like, with power.  Yeah.  With power.  Yeah, with power.  Oh.  And he's a fraidy cat, too.  He wants to go sit with his mother in the quarters while the big fight is. 
[03:24:00]  What the fuck, dude?  I'm out there.  You've got the little fella leading the fucking troops.  How much of the other storylines do you know about when you're filming, or do they keep  you pretty much on your own?  No, I know everything, yeah.  Oh, you do?  Okay.  You get the full scripts, yeah.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  That's pretty, that's pretty good.  We've done, we, you know, we opened in March, but we have two days next week that we have  to shoot in LA, because there's this one, one scene with one character that just can't  leave the state.  So we have, we know the whole circus is coming to. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, one character cannot leave the state.  That sounds interesting.  Yeah.  Is it a legal issue?  I can't tell you.  Oh, all right.  It's a little, you know.  That's nice to know.  Can't leave the state.  All right.  Shooting in California.  Look for Charles Manson in the next season.  You guessed it.  I can't believe you guessed it.  They're going to have to explain why this character in Game of Thrones has an ankle bracelet on him.  I know.  It's a new piece of armor.  Yeah.  Wow.  That's an odd, interesting role. 
[03:25:00]  So you're in the middle of filming it now?  Well, well, next week, yeah.  We wrapped in November, but now we just come back for this, for these two days.  Oh, so what happens?  Oh, so how does it end?  He can say it.  I'd still be confused.  I really need that HBO app just to follow him.  It is confusing, yeah.  You know what's great about in the day and age we live in, the wondrous day and age we live in.  When it starts up again, you know when it's starting up, so a few weeks prior, you can just do the marathon, load in those discs, or go online, and just watch all of them again. 
[03:25:30]  And it's fantastic, man.  It shows how good it is, though, that you would actually want to study it before you watch it again.  You want to know before the new ones come up.  I'm going to go through this.  The HBO app is amazing.  I'm going to watch the seasons one and two again before three, even though I've seen them.  That app is pretty amazing, and then you can click on the different castles, and then it comes up with this back story.  Oh, it's intense.  Yeah, it's really good.  So much back story.  It's the best opening music, I think.  It's the best opening sequence on TV.  It's unbelievable.  There's nothing worse than a shitty opening theme song. 
[03:26:00]  You can just dread it.  Knock on our door.  That's a good one.  It'll happen for you.  HBO just knows how to do original programming.  It's amazing.  You were talking about Showtime.  It just seems like the second-level original programming.  HBO has just had so many great shows to watch.  And people wait for it.  And even though you could DVR shows and stuff like that, you don't want to do it because there's assholes all over Twitter that spoil it for you. 
[03:26:30]  So you'll sit down and watch these shows when they first run like that.  Or you get off Twitter.  Well, come on now.  Let's be real.  Let's be real.  Are we allowed to?  Can't we do that?  That's where my life is.  My life exists on Twitter.  Are you on Twitter?  No.  No?  What the hell's the matter with you?  I'm on this new stuff.  You damn kids.  He doesn't need Twitter.  He's like a handsome actor with a great career.  Why would he need to just go on and tell people they suck? 
[03:27:00]  To tell everyone that you're handsome and have a career?  That's what I do.  Jesus.  Just post pictures of other people.  You have a Twitter account.  Yeah.  Just read out your last five tweets.  All right.  Let's hear it.  That's a good one.  Okay.  Good idea.  Let's see how important it is.  Every time I'm on Twitter, I'm like, how much longer do you have to do this?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  What's the end game here?  Right.  When does it stop?  What's the Twitter end game?  Damn it.  All right.  Was damn it one?  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  19 hours ago.  Oh, my God.  To update.  There it is. 
[03:27:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  One's directed to me.  Let's see.  Anthony.  Hey, guys.  Your boy, Alex Jones versus Piers Morgan.  Here's the YouTube link.  We played it on the show already today.  Thank you for not listening to the program.  That's kind of useful, linking up a...  Yeah, something that we've already done.  Yeah, that's good.  Okay.  If Steven Singer has limited quantities and he runs out selling like hotcakes, why the  fuck do we have to hear the commercials every day?  One of our sponsors is clamoring about how you've got to order early because he sells 
[03:28:00]  out, and he's saying, why then advertise?  But those are tweets to you.  How about the ones you sent out?  I was going to say, the last, your tweets.  The ones sent out to you.  Oh, my.  The ones you make.  Like, for instance...  Oh, you.  And then just a little.  All right.  I sent one out 23 hours ago.  My cabbie's breath stinks so badly, I can smell it in the back seat.  And then hashtag Raging Hardon.  That's a good one.  Poetry.  Let's see.  Raging Hardon.  I guess...  Wait, wait. 
[03:28:30]  Here we go.  Somebody tweeted, January 4th, 2013, Marty McFly travels back in time.  20 years.  And I said, ugh, anyone tweeting this horse shit to me will be blocked.  Because it's inaccurate back to the future.  Is there anything worse than when someone says, read your last five tweets, and they're  not good ones?  They stink!  They just really go, you get...  I said the last five, and you go, oh, I've got a great one.  2011.  My last one was LOL, thanks. 
[03:29:00]  It stinks.  All right, here's what I'm responding to.  Somebody who said, called me a dirty fucking racist wop.  I hope you die, you faggot, for the shit you said about black women.  I don't know.  I said you should hear what I say off the air.  This is what I've got to deal with on a daily basis.  Yes, his parents tweeting him.  And then I posted the Evil Dead trailer, which is very frightening.  You're right.  I really have no business being on any kind of social networking platform. 
[03:29:30]  Yes, all you do is spew disinformation.  But also, clearly, you get a lot of abuse.  A lot of abuse.  You're right.  Why even...  Why bother with that?  I don't know!  But now you're right, and I'm angry!  It's really true.  Like, because I follow you, and the stuff you deal with every day is pretty intense.  It's crazy.  It's a constant...  Why do I want to do that?  That's a whole different question, then.  Who do you follow, and why?  Oh.  I like following comedians. 
[03:30:00]  And what does that give...  Oh, comedians.  Comedians, pretty good to follow, yeah.  Funny, and coming up with good lines.  Hot girls.  Because sometimes they say dirty things.  I don't follow hot girls.  No, I mean...  No?  Did you see that game last night?  There was a football game.  Yes, and they kept cutting to that gorgeous girl.  That is the quarterback's girlfriend.  And then apparently her Twitter account went from $500,000 to $100,000.  Yeah.  Just went crazy.  We're talking about this morning.  She's very pretty.  But why is it then you decide to follow her as, like, she's hot, and I might...  Yeah, you're right.  Why?  She might rub up on me because I follow her on Twitter.  Yeah. 
[03:30:30]  She looks really smart.  I bet she'd tweet some funny things.  Yeah, ooh, which is I wear.  It's a chance to contact.  Like, if she'll write something, you can write back, yeah, and hope she'll, like, go, oh, thanks.  We are in a day and age, we've talked about this in the past, where celebrities are accessible  now through things like Twitter and Facebook and stuff.  And in the old days, we talked about how, you know, what would it take to have written  to Clark Gable?  You had to write a letter, send it, hope that it didn't go through the manager and agents  and publicity people and actually get to him.  Ah, well, let me answer this gentleman back. 
[03:31:00]  Wasn't there a movie a couple of years ago, My Date with Drew Barrymore?  Yeah, the guy was...  That was about this guy trying to...  Trying to get contact her, yeah, and get a date with her.  And he finally does.  That's...  But today, he could just have gone...  Yeah.  And you actually have a connection, for some reason, with celebrities.  And I'm finding...  Do any of those celebrities even touch their account themselves?  Right.  Do they have?  Don't they have?  Some do.  Very strange.  Some do.  Some are very into it, where it's like, why are you even responding?  Yeah.  Others, I guess they have their people do it, but... 
[03:31:30]  You can usually tell.  Odd thing.  You can usually...  You can tell.  Oh, I'm just drinking the greatest coffee from...  Yeah, sponsored.  Yeah.  You know, okay.  Driving my Jag.  Yeah, or if they tweet the same thing.  God, this Fuji water tastes delicious.  Yeah, you can kind of tell when it's some stupid PR person doing it for you.  Some people actually do make money of it, right?  Yeah.  Do you make money of it?  On Twitter, not a dime.  It's just...  I've been offered, but the thing is, I would have had to tweet, my followers would have murdered 
[03:32:00]  me for it.  It wasn't enough money to make the backlash worth it.  Oh, yeah.  I don't have enough followers to make it worth it.  So what would it be?  Right.  Just product placement stuff.  Oh, yeah.  And they would kill me for that.  Right.  Unless I was really...  Smart.  Yeah, I can't do it.  I love this.  Condom ads.  They'd be like, Jimmy doesn't use those.  Exactly.  I could say these are really helpful, allegedly.  I've heard.  Yes, I've heard these are good.  Friends have told me these things work.  Yes, according to people with healthy lifestyles and self-esteem, this is good for you. 
[03:32:30]  But yeah, nobody would believe it.  Can I ask you, this is a corny question, but how did you...  What was the audition process you went through for Game of Thrones?  Was it just you heard about it, went, or did they have a question?  Well, I met David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two writers.  They told me about the story, and then I went on tape, and that was it.  And you got it from tape?  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do you know how hard it is to land something from tape? 
[03:33:00]  Jesus.  When you look like us.  That's a good point.  You have that look, though.  That's pretty cool with, you know, the hair and the beard.  You kind of do look like you could be back then, there, in that magical time.  Well, you...  In 2011, Buddy TV ranked you as the 85th sexiest man alive.  85th?  That's true.  Yes.  Do you know that?  No.  Oh, I was hoping you knew, because I was going to ask who beat you.  I was wondering, like, who is the person...  84 guys.  Yeah, who is the one guy in front of you?  Can we look that up, Sam? 
[03:33:30]  Who beat...  It was the 85th?  Okay, we got to start.  Oh, okay.  Can we look at who beat Jamie in...  Oh, that's okay.  There's quite a few.  I can think of a few.  I just called you Jamie.  I could think.  Oh, Jimmy.  I did.  I called him his character name.  Terrible.  How awful is that?  Do you get that on the street?  People are like, hey, Jamie.  Kingsley!  Oh, they don't even know?  They didn't even know the character name?  No, they do.  No, they do.  Well, there's a hardcore following from the books, right?  I mean, it's like... 
[03:34:00]  No, it's great.  It's a heavy nerd culture part of it.  Yeah, but, you know, I really like it.  Because people are so passionate about these books.  They really are, man.  They love the characters, so there's none.  Yes.  I mean, in the beginning, I guess I was a little worried  if people were going to feel about me  like they do about Joffrey,  but they actually seem to like Jamie.  Yeah, you go to Comic-Con with it and all that?  I went the first year.  Last year we're working.  But, no, it was actually a great experience  because, you know, there's a lot of passion.  Oh, man, I'm sure there is.  I love it. 
[03:34:30]  But it's a lot of grown-ups dressed up.  They're dressing for free like you do for a lot of money.  And the movie...  Mama, yes.  Mama.  Mama.  And it's in studio.  When is it in theaters?  January the 18th.  And obviously Game of Thrones,  or according to the moron that made up our sheet,  Games of Thrones.  Oh, God.  Idiot Sal.  Starts March 31st.  But Mama's the big one that...  It's going to be scary.  Am I pronouncing your name right?  Is the J silent? 
[03:35:00]  It's like an I, yeah.  Okay, so it is a Nikolai.  Yeah.  Okay, I thought so,  but I didn't want to say it wrong.  I'm going to humiliate myself.  I mean, every American will say Nikolaj.  They will?  Oh, that's crazy.  I kind of sense that it wasn't.  I'm like, I couldn't be getting that right so easily.  No, it's kind of a...  It's kind of an H-y sound.  Nikolai.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Nikolai Costa-Waldo.  Am I saying it right?  Perfect.  Okay, the last name I worked on.  The first one, I'm like, just fucking ask.  Very good.  All right.  I'm going to call him Jamie.  When you go on tape or something,  do you light it?  Are you asking me?  Oh. 
[03:35:30]  No, I usually have my wife bring the camera over  and then we shoot it.  Wow, that's really good.  Oh, you do it at home?  Yeah, because I'm in Denmark.  I live in Denmark.  Oh, really?  I'm not going to travel for an addition.  Nah.  Are you embarrassed to act in front of your wife?  I would be embarrassed to...  You'd be embarrassed to act in front of anyone, Jim.  I know, I know.  But I mean, it's somebody who knows you  to all of a sudden be a different person.  Is that hard for you in a room?  It's intimate.  It's just you and her with the camera?  No, I know.  It's good.  You're comfortable with that?  No, I like that.  Because I know her well and she's got good taste. 
[03:36:00]  Sometimes I find it more difficult.  If you go into a room and you meet a casting director,  you've never met and it's something you have to break down  and it's a little uncomfortable.  You talk a little bit first and all of a sudden...  Yeah, because then that's the problem.  I used to hate that, going in the small talk  where you just go,  Hey, so how are you doing?  And then you've got to go into...  Okay, let's do it.  And then you're supposed to turn into this evil thing.  You just talk about your kids and then...  What was the scene you put on tape?  The scene was in episode one where I come to see... 
[03:36:30]  I have to come to pick up my brother.  He's in a brothel.  That was the scene.  Okay.  Oh, yes.  I think there was...  I can't remember.  That was the scene.  So you do it from...  You created your whole career from Denmark.  That's where...  Yeah.  That's pretty great.  We have to wrap up, Tom.  Oh, damn it.  Please.  This was Tom.  I know.  It's interesting.  Tom.  Yes.  You're a great actor, and I love, love, love what you do and what you're in.  Yeah, thanks so much for coming in.  I'm going to see Mama.  I didn't even know you were in it.  I really had no idea.  It looks scary.  It's a movie that's horrifying looking.  Yeah, yeah.  It's good.  And I do want to see it. 
[03:37:00]  It comes out January the 18th, and I guess we're done, too.  Very cool.  We'll see everybody tomorrow.  See you tomorrow.  Thank you.  Ma'am.
