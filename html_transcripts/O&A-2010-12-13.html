<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show covered a wide range of topics throughout its broadcast.  The show opened with a critical discussion of New York Jets assistant coach Sal Alosi intentionally tripping a Miami Dolphins player,  predicting his imminent firing and lamenting the Jets' poor performance. This transitioned into a discussion of the Metrodome roof collapse in Minnesota, fueled by a caller's conspiracy theory suggesting it was a deliberate act by the Vikings owner to secure taxpayer funding for a new stadium.  The ensuing chaos and unexpectedly free admission to a rescheduled game were also discussed.

Opie recounted a lavish Jets game experience, contrasting it with observations about the underutilization of newer stadiums.  A humorous digression followed about receiving flu shots at a "dirty" drugstore.  Caller anecdotes added to the mix – one about meeting Snooki and Ralph Macchio, and another about a gruesome subway accident involving a man pinned between a train and a platform extender.  Tom Brady's performance, Opie's upcoming appearance on Jay Leno, and an upcoming poker tournament at Foxwoods were briefly mentioned.  The hosts also reviewed "The Blind Side," criticizing Sandra Bullock's Oscar win and expressing concerns about the film's portrayal of race relations.  This led to a discussion about the film's perceived inaccuracies, including the depiction of a polite, large Black man and the interactions between Sandra Bullock's character and rednecks, questioning the absence of racial slurs.

The conversation then shifted to Twitter profile issues, a discussion about Phil Collins' daughter's age (initially misidentified as 17, later corrected to 21), and Bernie Madoff's son's suicide, with the hosts expressing cynicism about Madoff's alleged emotional response.  A CNN broadcast error featuring a "Dumb and Dumber" bathroom scene during a news segment provided further comedic fodder.  A lavish gift from Dr. Steve prompted a discussion on re-gifting, before transitioning to near-death experiences. This included a caller named Steve's anecdote involving angel dust, along with a debate on the afterlife referencing Joe Rogan's views on DMT and Dr. Steve’s skeptical perspective as a hospice doctor, including a study on near-death experiences.

The show continued with discussions about the "SantaCon" event in New York City, including anecdotes about intoxicated Santas, arrests, and a cab driver refusing service to a drunk woman.  Observations from a visit to St. Patrick's Cathedral led to a discussion about removing hats indoors, with various speculative explanations offered by the hosts and a caller. This segued into an angry rant against New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and various city-related grievances concerning traffic, cab drivers, and pedestrians, with Anthony detailing aggressive driving encounters. A caller claimed that actor Roland described his new movie as "shit," leading to discussion about Michael Madsen's missed call-in.  The show then touched on Paul McCartney's "Scrambled Eggs" parody on Jimmy Fallon,  a comparison of terrible movies viewed by the hosts (*The Love Guru* and *Cooper's Christmas*),  further discussion of the Metrodome roof collapse, and even a mention of the Australian film *Bad Boy Bubby* and a song by Vladimir Putin at a cancer benefit.

Later segments featured a discussion about the hosts' differing opinions on the best and worst movies of the 2000s, with disagreements about *About Schmidt*.  The Metrodome roof collapse was revisited, along with playful banter about attire for an upcoming Paul McCartney concert, including speculation about disruptive behavior.  Callers shared their Paul McCartney concert experiences, leading to discussions about the concert's employee ticket lottery and the confusion surrounding its distribution. The show concluded with more discussion about the concert, song preferences, and a final advertisement for Pajamagram.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Opie and Anthony are no strangers to scandal.  Opie and Anthony on satellite radio.  Satellite radio.  Apparently, Opie and Anthony are dicks.  Oh, here they go again.  Fun, dopey radio show.  Not just any radio show.  A radio show that inspires beyond your wildest dream.  This show is a lot funnier on any W.  The show's host, Anthony Camilla and Greg Opie here.  Non-diversal team.  Six years without getting fired, a new record for us.  It's just astounding to me. 
[00:00:30]  I didn't want to say it's racist, but goddamn.  This show will rock as best as we could possibly do this radio show.  I'm going to go home and whack to a tranny later.  There you go, all right.  We just lost our demo, man.  What's wrong with you?  Who's just the last off of the watching radio duo?  The Opie and Anthony show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Hey! 
[00:01:00]  Morning!  There it is.  There we go.  My, my, my Jets are in trouble.  I follow them.  My Jets are in trouble.  I never had much confidence in that team.  What are you talking about?  They're your Jets.  Nah, nah, nah.  They're not your Jets anymore?  Nah, I've never really been a fan.  Oh boy.  Oh boy.  Jets are in trouble.  In big trouble.  You didn't like to...  We haven't scored a touchdown in, what, eight quarters now? 
[00:01:30]  I like their defensive...  Maybe more?  Their defensive plays are nice.  Even for people that aren't, you know, playing.  Ugh.  That's, uh...  You know what I mean?  That'll turn out well.  What happened?  You haven't...  It's the big thing today.  Oh, it's hysterical.  It's the front page of the paper.  Dumb Jets.  What was it?  The, uh...  What was it?  It was the exercise guy for the Jets?  Yeah, he wasn't a, uh...  The coordinator?  One of the coordinators?  One of the coordinators.  He...  He tripped one of the Dolphins players.  As he's running down the sideline?  As he's running down the sideline. 
[00:02:00]  Like, no one's gonna see that?  He put his knee out and kneed the guy.  And the guy went down.  I say the guy.  I don't have all the names in front of me.  From the sideline?  Yeah.  And openly admitted it.  He said he just fucking, like, panicked or...  Not even panicked.  Lost his mind.  He lost his mind.  Lost his fucking mind.  Like, everyone else is losing their mind over the Jets.  So, he puts his knee out and the guy trips.  Go to the sports section.  There's a still of it.  I know they're your team and I want to see them do well.  But I have such a hatred for that organization. 
[00:02:30]  And they fuck their fans every time.  Every time.  I would love to see them win for you.  Yeah, there's the clip right there.  Every year.  Sam's got it up on the little video monitoring system.  Uh, Jets Dolphins game show coach.  What's a show coach?  Uh, Sal Alosi.  Sticking his left knee out.  Tripping Miami returner Nolan Carroll.  Who tumbled to the ground temporarily injured.  Well, that wasn't a very good shot of the, um, the episode. 
[00:03:00]  What happened?  No.  They're not showing the, uh, actual...  Why wouldn't they show it?  Maybe they show that.  Maybe they show that later.  No, I've seen it.  Yeah, look.  Fast forward a little bit.  There's the still shot.  He actually put his left leg out and tripped him.  Yeah, here you go.  Oh, no.  Let me see.  Yeah.  So he's running down the sideline.  Oh, oops.  That guy is so fired.  So completely and utterly fired. 
[00:03:30]  People are talking about a fine, a suspension.  This guy is so fired.  He slowly snuck his knee out and, uh, nailed him.  You can't do that and expect to continue in football as a coach, a coach's assistant, whatever  the hell this guy does.  Didn't someone do that years and years and years ago from Alabama?  Sure.  Every once in a while you get somebody that does this.  I want to jerk off.  What an idiot, right?  But you can't even think that he's...  No one would do that and think they're going to get away with it. 
[00:04:00]  You have to know.  Maybe someone's watching.  No, the guy understands that.  He admitted it pretty much right away and said, I just lost my mind.  He goes, I lost my mind.  I don't have a good excuse.  I just lost it.  The insanity plea.  Nice.  Yeah.  So, Jets go down to the Dolphins.  What the fuck?  10 to 6.  The Dolphins.  Are they terrible this year?  They're not good.  The news was making a big to-do about how the New York Rangers scored more points than 
[00:04:30]  the Jets did yesterday.  Oh, really?  That's hilarious.  Yeah.  So funny.  So, man.  But more importantly, we haven't scored a touchdown in a while.  Did you see the game?  No, I didn't see the game.  Did you see Holmes drop?  I saw highlights and shit.  Did you see the drop pass?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I saw all the important things.  That drop pass, he was so open.  But that happens a lot when a guy is so wide open.  Something happens in his brain like, oh, my God, I'm tired. 
[00:05:00]  It's like, there's no way I can miss this.  I think you jinx yourself in that split second the ball's coming at you.  You're like, I'm so wide open.  There's no way I'm missing this.  But, man, you throw a rocket and they have to tiptoe the sidelines.  They have no problem.  Thread the needle between two defenders.  They're right there.  Bam.  But you float one to one of these guys where he's just basically waiting for it.  I'm not.  I'm not.  Your brain has too much time to think, I guess.  Yeah.  Drops it.  Holmes, who's been an animal the last few weeks. 
[00:05:30]  We'll see if the Jets.  I don't think they fully recovered from that devastating loss of last week.  To the Patriots, 45-3 and now 10-6.  Yeah.  So the Jets haven't scored a touchdown in at least eight quarters.  Eight quarters.  At least.  And you're talking about the Woody Hayes play, I guess.  Which one's that?  You said, didn't this happen years ago?  Brian in Maryland.  Real fast.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Woody Hayes went into this career by choking the opposing team's player after they intercepted 
[00:06:00]  against Ohio State.  I don't remember the choking one.  I know there was some kind of coach from Alabama.  And a guy was running down the sidelines.  And he didn't even trip.  He jumped out and tackled the motherfucker.  Right there when he was running.  It's one of those old, oldie clips.  Bear Bryant.  It's got to be Bear Bryant.  Is it Bear Bryant?  Tackled a guy once.  Ohio State coach punched a player once.  I remember that.  So every once in a while, you get some action on the sideline.  Yeah.  But this guy, what the fuck are you thinking? 
[00:06:30]  He's so fired.  Yeah, completely fired.  I don't know why they're talking about the fines and the suspensions.  It's like, what do you think?  They're going to fine him for that one?  No.  He can't be trusted on the sideline ever again.  He's going to be looking very jabbed.  By the way, I got to go to the stadium yesterday.  Holy shit, what a fucking...  Oh, that's right.  Holy shit, was that nice.  Nice?  Oh, my God.  I want to thank the Jets organization because I got the easy pass, basically.  Oh, is that it?  I got the easy pass to the game. 
[00:07:00]  And it's the only way to see football.  And I wish everyone could do what I did yesterday.  I'm not even joking.  Fancy.  I was picked up at my apartment.  20 minutes later, I'm in this VIP area in a bar.  It looked like a huge, just really nice over-the-top restaurant with a big, huge bar in the middle.  And there's the game right in front of you.  All the food you could eat.  All the shit you could drink.  Desserts.  That sounds fun.  Flat screens everywhere where you don't even feel like going outside to watch the game.  Fuck, it's too cold. 
[00:07:30]  And then you got kind of like a balcony to check out the game.  You know, they have this situation in a lot of cities.  But then they give you tickets to go all the way down to the front row to check out the game.  Oh, so you get, like, really close?  I was in the front row.  Like, 25-yard line, something like that.  That's nice.  It was sweet.  That stadium is awesome.  Isn't it cool?  Like, New York wound up getting three brand-new fucking stadiums to check out in, like, no time.  But I was thinking about the stadium.  Well, Jersey, sorry.  Fuck you.  You're a big Yankees fan. 
[00:08:00]  I got to see the brand-new Yankee Stadium this past summer.  I went to one game just to check it out.  Awesome.  Even though I'm a Mets fan.  Still haven't seen the Mets' new stadium.  Citi Field.  But I'm looking at, you know, where the Jets play there.  What's the name of the stadium?  I don't know.  They change names all the time.  Yeah.  This is called Giant Stadium, even though the Jets play there, too.  That's fine.  And I was thinking, they only use this place 50 days a year, maybe.  I know, yeah.  Maybe.  Isn't that fucked up?  The Jets use it for 10 games about, well, that's if they make the playoffs. 
[00:08:30]  So we might have to say eight games this year.  We'll see.  Because they're just falling apart in front of everyone's eyes.  The new Meadowlands Arena.  Oh, thank you.  And then you've got the Giants.  They do about eight to ten games a year, right?  So that's, if both teams make the playoffs and do very well, it's almost 20 days.  And then the rest of the year, the thing just sits there.  It just sits there.  Unless you two or Bruce Springsteen is coming to town.  It sits there.  Yeah.  Big, giant concerts because you can't just put anybody in there. 
[00:09:00]  Right.  It's going to look a little sparse.  Isn't that amazing, though?  The amount of money basically, I mean, wasted?  How the fuck do they make that?  If you're not a sports fan, you've got to think, what a waste of money that they built  this amazing stadium to be used maybe 50 days a year.  Like, baseball, it's amazing how many games they play a year.  So it's insanity.  Right.  But how does a football stadium pay for itself?  I don't know.  With just that many games.  And why spend all that money and not put a roof on that damn thing? 
[00:09:30]  Does anyone know the answer to that?  They must have decided against that for whatever reason.  Maybe costs?  I don't think costs.  I wonder why.  Maybe they want that natural, freezing cold fucking...  Because it's a nice, state-of-the-art stadium, and it doesn't have a roof on it.  Yeah.  Which we kind of could have used yesterday because the rain came a-down yesterday.  A little rainy.  A little rainy, yeah.  They should have put a retractable roof.  Then again, you'll have the Metrodome situation.  That's that old puffy balloon. 
[00:10:00]  Huh?  Yeah.  That's that stupid, puffy balloon roof that they have.  They got 18 billion tons of snow on top of it.  You would think if you got that type of a dome, you have some kind of snow removal plan.  And you realize, it goes back to what you say a lot, Ant, where you think people have  things figured out, and they just don't.  They just don't.  They're human beings like us.  They just don't have everything figured out.  Just dummies.  I love this.  And the cameras were set right up in there.  Right.  And you see the ceiling just start coming down.  It opens up and spills a fuckload of snow on the field. 
[00:10:30]  Everyone's seen this video by now, right?  Yeah.  That's great.  Do you think that would have killed you if you were standing there?  Huh?  I don't know.  Do you think that would have killed you if you were standing underneath that snow?  Oh, yeah.  Because it's packed snow.  It's probably like ice and fucking...  I believe you would have killed somebody.  Yeah.  And that's...  If the Giants were in town, I believe they would have been in there, right?  It looks fluffy from that angle.  Yeah, you'd have been fucking squeezed.  You think?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think so, too. 
[00:11:00]  Knowing the weather that they get up there, you'd think they would have went with a more  rigid roof or something.  Isn't that an older stadium now, too?  Right?  Yeah, I guess so.  Thank God Pam Oliver's there.  Oh, fuck Pam Oliver.  I like when she covers things.  Do you?  Yeah, her hair looks good.  Her hair looks fantastic.  They have had some minor problems with the roof in the past.  Some rips and shit with some leaks and snow has gotten through, but nothing like that.  That was the whole thing just going...  They were just a few hours away from people being in there if the game wasn't canceled. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And that was because the Giants just couldn't get there.  Because they got snowed in and what?  They had to go to Kansas City?  Yeah.  And now the Giants are playing Minnesota and Detroit?  That's got to be weird for Detroit.  Who's going to go and see that game?  Well, they're free.  It's free.  So anyone could go?  So anyone could just go.  Holy shit.  They decided...  Because they decided who the fuck is going to pay or travel.  Right.  So they just said, you know, come on in.  It's free.  Oh, my God. 
[00:12:00]  It might turn some people from Detroit on to, you know, some of the teams.  They get to see an extra...  But they have a team.  I know.  They said they get to see an extra, you know, NFL game, so...  You know what free means, right?  Riot.  That's what I'm thinking.  I'm thinking...  I'm thinking...  Is the game on tonight?  I'm thinking Detroit, free.  And where are they showing the game?  Because we got Monday Night Football, and then what?  They're just throwing that game on somewhere else?  Yeah.  Or is it local?  What's going on?  Because now I've got to see.  Because if they're allowing people to see a football game for free, there's going to 
[00:12:30]  be problems.  I think it's just going to look exactly like in Louisiana during fucking Katrina with the  dumb fucking place.  It's going to be a disaster.  Right on, man.  Let me say hi to Brian in Minnesota.  Brian.  Brian.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey, buddy.  Hello.  This whole Metrodome roof collapse thing is about a big a scam, as you'll hear this year.  And with the WMDs as the pretense for going and evading Iraq, the collapsing Metrodome 
[00:13:00]  roof is just Ziggy Wilf, the owner of the Vikings, backhanded attempt at getting the  taxpayers to fund his fancy new stadium.  What, did he do a snow dance and make it snow on top of the roof?  No, no, no, no, no, no.  If this snow, yes, we got a big whopping snow, top five snowfalls of all time or whatever.  Uh-huh.  But this stuff was dust.  This was light, fluffy.  So how is it done?  Wait a minute.  Are you suggesting thermite paint was used inside the dome? 
[00:13:30]  They did say it popped like a balloon.  Jesse knows the layout of that dome.  I understand that one.  Coming from my home state.  I don't think that's hysterical.  No, we have had much heavier, wetter, denser, sloppier snows.  Does it matter?  It happens.  And sometimes it's just that perfect thing, enough wind, the right amount of snow.  So you think the owner took a chance?  I think someone was up there with a little box cutter putting a little slit in the roof. 
[00:14:00]  And that's probably all it takes.  Yeah, the conspiracy for everything.  Maybe Jesse's got another episode to record.  But why would that guy take a chance?  Because he would go into the dome with the snow.  Maybe he did.  Kind of like the scuba diver in the forest.  Yeah, they find him and they're like, what was he doing?  Yeah, in the middle of a forest that burned down.  And here's a scuba diver.  And he doesn't have a burn on him.  It's just kind of weird that they had the Fox News cameras running at 6 o'clock in the morning. 
[00:14:30]  It's a stadium on the day of a game.  I mean, it's not all that odd, dude.  But the place was empty and there was no visiting team.  The visiting team was in Missouri.  It's just great, man.  I love conspiracies.  It really is fantastic.  It's just another taxpayer getting raped.  I think waiting for a big snowstorm might take a while.  You've got to be pretty patient for that one.  And now you're just going to get a new stadium.  What do they do for the rest of the season?  They could repair this fucking thing.  They said they could repair it pretty easily because it is one of those blow-up roofs. 
[00:15:00]  Well, the roof is duct tape, essentially.  Is it?  Positive pressure keeps the thing in front of you.  Yeah, so once a hole gets in it, it just goes bleh.  You know what would have been worse?  Even if nobody was on the field at that moment, but there were people in the stands, the panic that would have happened would have been a stampede.  Absolutely.  Just people like, yeah, we're dying.  Yeah.  Just running out of the place.  Weren't they supposed to do some kind of a thing?  Every year on the field, they have a hat show at that time. 
[00:15:30]  And thank God nobody was there.  Hat show.  It would have gotten snow in their hats.  I once had tickets to that.  I couldn't make it.  I was very disappointed.  Minnesota hat show, yeah.  Chad is very upset with Brian, who's still on the line.  No, you're not punching out, Brian.  Hold on, hold on.  Chad, go ahead.  Dude, we had almost, in some spots, we had two feet of snow.  And when it collects up like that, it's heavy.  That's an inflated roof.  I've been in there in thunderstorms where it started to waver and collapse. 
[00:16:00]  I mean, it's heavy.  It's going to collapse.  You don't think the roof was a setup, or you think the roof just collapsed?  Dude, they used to have a system in there with heated water to keep the moisture coming off.  Off of what?  Off the roof.  Yeah, but with 50-mile-an-hour winds, the way that the dome is shaped, the wind goes over the dome. 
[00:16:30]  There's really no place for wind to eddy and create drift greater than two feet of snow.  Why would the roof just collapse, though?  Because Ziggy wants a new stadium.  No.  Sir, do you think that the roof just collapsed?  Yes.  The other guy.  Yeah, the other guy we're talking to.  Hold your horses for a minute.  Chad.  So they put a heating system.  Where did they put it?  They have a system in the roof, and you can see the steam. 
[00:17:00]  Really?  How do they get it in there?  Like during construction, or is it an aftermarket thing?  I'm not sure.  They were talking on one of the sports shows last night here locally about the system that they've had  to keep the snow from building on the roof too heavily.  Kind of like a radiant heat system.  Well, the guy talking, why would they put the heating system, though, in the stadium?  I don't understand.  Why would they put it under the stadium?  Yeah, that's a weird place for it.  It's supposed to be in the ceiling. 
[00:17:30]  You can look at the top of the ceiling in the stadium, and there are all those themes.  Selling.  And it's supposed to keep the snow from the building on the roof.  Shut up.  We were just making fun of the way you said roof.  We didn't care what word you were saying after that.  It was just funny that you kept saying roof.  Roof.  Roof.  Roof.  Roof.  All right, Chad and Brian in Minnesota, thank you.  We're just assholes.  Guy's like, yeah, let me explain.  These guys are interested in my whole hot water thing.  We don't give a hooch.  I was laughing at the way you say roof. 
[00:18:00]  Seems like that design is awful, though.  They finally got caught with their pants down.  Or their roof down.  Ha-ha, the roof.  The roof.  Roof.  Roof.  Eh, whatever.  So, you got that going on.  Which means Brett Favre has a chance to keep his streak alive.  He said he'd even be very surprised if he was going to come out and play.  He's so injured.  Oh, okay.  He thinks it's over.  Everybody's saying this is it.  It's done.  Oh, okay.  His streak, done.  He says he's not coming out, so. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, all right.  Odd one.  I also, um, uh, I got to see the Super Bowl trophy.  It was on display yesterday at the Meadowlands Stadium there.  The new Meadowlands Stadium.  Yeah.  And I want to thank 523 people on Twitter for coming up with the exact same joke.  Congratulations.  Oh, don't you love that?  Isn't it funny?  523, I kept track.  What was the joke about what?  That's the closest you and your team will ever be to the trophy.  They tweet it like that? 
[00:19:00]  Yes.  With spit and all?  Yes.  There's a special font for that.  Ah.  So, I know that's how they were saying it.  It's called spittle.  Yeah.  I tweeted a picture of the Super Bowl trophy, and of course, everyone.  Spittle courier.  That's the closest you or your team will ever be.  Stupid Jets.  I agree with you, actually.  The big collapse is starting again.  Yes.  Are you kidding me?  I know.  They looked promising by the skin of their teeth, as they say.  Did they? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  They pull off some of those amazing finishes where they won.  Sanchez looked like shit.  You do realize that.  Sanchez looked like shit.  My quarterback looked like shit.  Looked like shit.  And then Holmes is dropping easy passes when Sanchez wasn't looking like shit.  Bad one.  Did you see what Brady did up there in Chicago?  Did you see what Brady did?  Did you see the highlights?  Mike Brady?  Tom Brady.  Oh, I thought you meant Mike Brady from the Brady Bunch.  They were talking about how the Pats-Bears games could be the worst conditions for a football game ever. 
[00:20:00]  I don't know if they set that record and how they figured it out.  That's great.  At times, the wind was blowing 50 miles an hour.  Did it affect Brady?  The answer would be fucking no.  If you remember a game a few years back, Patriots-Oakland, I think it was, in the snow.  And it was one of the most amazing football games I ever saw.  That was in the playoffs, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Dallas Dolphins.  A few years ago, 20 years ago, in the snow on Thanksgiving.  It's just, it adds like a cool, exciting, kick-ass element to a game. 
[00:20:30]  That's why I hate when they put domes up, because you want to see that old school football where you don't even know where the lines are.  This footage, if you want to search for it, where they got tractors and plows on the field while the team's down the one end, trying to clean up this side of the field.  So you can at least know where the goal line is.  Or if the field goal kicker comes out, they got to like snowblow the fucking thing away.  I loved all that shit.  That's great.  But the answer is no, it did not affect Brady.  No.  The league is in fucking trouble, because Brady's having one of those years. 
[00:21:00]  He's a machine.  Fucking 50 mile an hour winds at times, and he's just firing passes like it was a slight breeze in Chicago.  How's his Bosley hair treatment going?  He's doing all right.  Is he getting that?  Yeah, he's doing all right.  Does anyone see his head?  Has anyone seen his head and his hair?  Does he wear that cap all the time?  How are they saying he's losing hair?  I don't know.  Maybe he's doing that.  It doesn't make sense.  Maybe he's doing that Richie Cunningham comb over where during the show, you didn't even think he was bald. 
[00:21:30]  And like a year after the show was off the air, he was horseshoe bald.  I don't know what happened.  He was like swirling it around and hair spraying it or something.  All right.  Right there.  Now, if you look at that picture, there's definitely receding going on.  You got a little receder happening.  And he's getting a little bit of, from the front to the back, there's a little gully going on there.  Nicholson.  And, yeah.  He looks like Phil Collins in that picture.  A little Phil Collins-ish.  No, it's not.  But when his hair is dry, he's able to spread it out a little bit. 
[00:22:00]  He's got the Justin Bieber there.  Right.  Oh, you know what?  Push it down a little bit.  He might be losing the whole front.  His chick is making him go for the hair transplant.  Is she?  Yeah.  Supposedly.  He's out-bunching?  So I don't know if he, because last I saw he was wearing like that cap and shit.  I don't know.  They do have a picture of Bieber.  That looks like his dad.  Did you see the video of Ozzy going, who the fuck is Bieber? 
[00:22:30]  No.  Ozzy rules.  And we can find that for Jimmy.  He'll appreciate that.  I don't know what the circumstances were.  Wait.  Who the fuck is Bieber?  Oh, yeah.  Someone asked him about Bieber.  And he's like, I don't know fucking Bieber.  Who's he?  That's great.  That's good.  Yeah, so the Pats are looking good with this Brady.  And he hasn't thrown an interception in something like 260, I want to say 268 attempts without  an interception.  They bring it up during the game because that's the insta-jinx. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  They brought it up.  He hasn't had an interception in many.  Oh, and that one picked off.  Yeah, that's always the case.  This is Amy's show.  This is Mark, who we interviewed.  Huh?  This is Amy's show.  Oh, it is that?  Oh, okay.  It's just Mark, interviewer.  Let's see.  What music are you listening to now?  Do you listen to new music?  I don't really listen to new music.  If something catches my ear, I don't listen to new metal bands.  I don't listen to go, give me the top 10 of the new metal.  I want to go.  One of the dangers of that is if I start to like it.  If something gets in my head, it'll come out of my mouth, you know. 
[00:23:30]  So you listen to a lot of Justin Bieber?  Who?  Justin Bieber?  Who the fuck's Justin Bieber?  Good.  I like that answer.  That's perfect.  Fucking Ozzy.  Who the fuck's Justin Bieber?  He's the greatest.  You know what?  If you keep playing that clip, it's great.  Ozzy gets up and leaves his presence behind and makes the host look like an idiot.  Say, wait a minute.  I had a guess.  Who the fuck's Justin Bieber?  Who the fuck's Justin Bieber?  They did something on me for her show.  She interviewed me at my house because they were doing fans. 
[00:24:00]  And I was the Ozzy fan that they interviewed.  Of course.  Yay!  Very cool.  I can't wait to see that.  Me neither.  So happy.  I was laying in bed last night and Spider-Man's on.  And I'm just starting to doze off.  I'm all relaxed.  And I just hear, he stinks and I don't like it.  Oh, someone stole my line.  I turned my head.  And there's a little Jimmy Surly truck driver Norton.  Let's see if they have a...  It's just so odd to see that as you're laying in bed. 
[00:24:30]  He stinks and I don't like it.  I was trying to, you know, trying to jerk off and...  Surly truck driver.  That helped you, huh?  It helped you.  That was when I had my money shot.  But tonight, at least we know we'll be listening to some music.  Paul McCartney's show tonight.  Yes!  Yeah, that's a biggie.  That's tonight at the Apollo Theater.  I hope I can make it.  Why?  What do you got?  The flu.  Oh, you don't have the flu.  You have a flu shot.  Jimmy's going to get mad.  Get a shot! 
[00:25:00]  I got a flu shot in one of these, like, just dirty drugstores.  No, you didn't go to a fucking pharmacy.  You went to, like, Rite Aid or...  I think it was Dwayne.  Dwayne Reed.  It was a dirty Dwayne Reed.  Where some fucking pharmacist sets up, like, a little...  Wow.  You've had shots there!  No, I've seen them.  I've seen them do it.  Oh, no!  Go to a doctor!  We were shopping after my little kid got his flu shot.  Took it like a champ, finally.  They're poking this kid with so many needles. 
[00:25:30]  These vaccinations are ridiculous.  Oh, man.  But he got his...  This...  What happened?  Did you know that?  That serious XM does it.  I didn't know that.  I'm not getting some fucking person from here to...  I'd rather go to a dirty drugstore.  And a Steve Blatter with a needle.  Yeah, probably.  Outside the men's room.  Just jabbing in the hiney and giggling.  That's what he does.  That's what Blatter just sticks in the ass and he goes, hee, hee, hee, hee.  And he runs down the hall.  He runs away when you're fucking at the urinal and just pokes you in the hiney. 
[00:26:00]  What's the free flu shot about around here?  Who does it?  They get doctors to come in.  They do it for free.  Get the fuck out of here.  Are there certain days or you got to make a point there?  Yeah, they sent a big company email out.  They say anybody who wants...  I don't get flu shots, but they say...  Can they do it from the time the elevator's on the 36th floor until the time it reaches  the lobby?  No.  Because that's the only time I think I'm available.  Yeah, no.  You guys probably aren't around long enough to take advantage.  That's a smart company thing, though.  So the whole fucking outfit isn't out getting in with the flu.  The whole outfit. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, but if you're smart, you get the flu shot so you don't get the flu and you still  take your flu fucking days.  That's what people do that are smart.  I don't like that flu shot.  So then you have three or four days, make it believe you have the flu, but you're actually  out there shopping and enjoying yourself.  That's how you really do it.  But why don't you...  Everyone knows.  Does the flu shot give you the flu?  I think so, because I don't feel good.  It injects you with a virus that is dead.  So why the fuck get the flu shot?  Well, because then your body can fight off the virus that's not going to infect you.  It's a weakened virus, so your body can fight it without it going... 
[00:27:00]  It's parts of the virus and it's dead, I believe.  And then your immune system goes, whoa, attack, attack!  Yeah.  And then it's done.  And then you're kind of...  But then what if you get a new flu?  Then your body says, oh, we've done that before.  Oh, it's old hat.  And they can fight it off easy.  There are certain types of flu vaccines that you're...  Now, you're not impervious to every flu.  I'm protected against three.  The three main ones for this season.  Because they know which flu is going to hit, I guess.  Which is...  You want to talk about conspiracy.  That's a little weird.  How do they know which flu is going to hit? 
[00:27:30]  So I went to this dirty Dwayne Reed and a dirty pharmacist fucking gave me a flu shot.  And he goes, you might get flu symptoms.  For how long, though?  Two weeks.  I woke up yesterday feeling like shit.  I almost didn't go to the jet ski.  You just get the flu.  That's great.  Aches, dizzy, light, light, all the flu symptoms.  And I'm still...  I still feel it today.  So why did I get the flu shot?  I wouldn't do it.  I guess because you only get the flu for two days instead of a couple weeks.  I call it hokum.  I might get it. 
[00:28:00]  I don't know.  Hokum.  What are they doing in here?  They did them already.  Oh, shit.  You missed them.  Oh, shit.  On a cracker.  Sorry.  You missed it.  They do it at the beginning of the season before everybody gets the flu.  Why don't they put out a company email?  They did.  Oh, shit.  So why is everyone beating me up if they already did the flu shots around here?  None of us knew.  Where was our invitation?  Probably in your email boxes.  I want McCartney and flu shots the same night.  That's the only emails I want.  You wouldn't get a flu shot at it, Dwayne Reed?  No.  Why not?  I've seen that filthy screen they bring over, and it's like in a corner, and then some frigging 
[00:28:30]  I don't know what comes up with a needle, and I see a lot of the elderly doing that after  they take fucking 15 minutes to get their script.  They walk up, and it's like, you know, but the insurance company, wait a minute, my Medicare  Part B, and then my Part C is supposed to be subsidized through AARP.  Hey, so if you call my doctor, I think, ah, I'm just trying to buy some condoms. 
[00:29:00]  We know that wasn't you saying that.  Where have you heard someone say that?  Exactly.  Let's go to James in New York.  James.  You guys got to be careful with those flu shots.  They put ingredients in there that, it's not the old sulfur egg formula from the 70s.  They've got things in there now, it's like aluminum, formaldehyde, things like that.  There's, you know, stuff in there. 
[00:29:30]  Formaldehyde?  This guy sounds like Troy.  I got something in this jar.  I want you to give it to Mel.  Tell him it's to hide it.  What's in the jar?  Formaldehyde.  That was an old gag they tried after, after who's on first that didn't quit.  It was the B side of who's on first.  Oh, Abacastella?  Yeah.  Formaldehyde.  This guy from Carolina, man, he's a regular.  He goes, anyone can give the shots.  He said, I was a poli-sci major and I gave the flu shots.  Poli-sci major.  That doesn't sound very good. 
[00:30:00]  I don't like that.  All right.  Thank you, James.  Let's go to Brett in Virginia.  Brett.  Hey, Ope.  I saw a picture with Snooki yesterday.  What's she smell like?  Could you smell her vag?  Oh.  Couldn't smell her vag.  I hate to say it, I met Snooki and a bunch of the guys from Jersey Shore, and she couldn't  have been nicer.  I feel bad that we beat the shit out of her.  I guess we have to continue beating the shit out of her, but she was really nice yesterday.  Did it smell like smoke or anything?  Booze. 
[00:30:30]  There was some booze going on with that gang.  Not myself.  I don't really drink these days.  Was she playing?  I see she's got some of that dark makeup under her eyes.  She's got some eye black on.  Yeah, she got the, to keep the sun out of her eyes, you know, for the game.  Was that it?  Yeah.  Or was she mouthing off to some guy at a bar again?  Gave her the old one-two.  Looks like she was told twice, huh?  Yes.  And I was leaning down in that picture just so I could get my head in the fucking frame. 
[00:31:00]  She is short.  She is ridiculously short.  Yeah.  And she had a boyfriend there, I guess her new man.  Oh, yeah.  She's got a boyfriend.  The guy can't be five foot tall.  Really?  Are you short, too?  Ridiculously short.  Is he all muscular?  He was pulling around like, I'm protecting Snooki, and we're all looking like, dude, chill  the fuck out.  Enjoy your Snooki, but you're not going to do anything.  She's got a little Jets jersey on.  She's all set.  Is he unpleasant?  Is her boyfriend?  No, he seemed like a cool guy.  I didn't really talk to him.  I talk to Vinny the most. 
[00:31:30]  There's Vinny from the Jersey Shore, who turns out to be a huge fan of the show and wants  in bad.  Oh, bro.  Get him on.  So we're going to have him on either this week or next week.  He's a very cool, down-to-earth guy.  Was the situation there?  Not the situation.  He rubbed his belly.  Oh, the abs.  Were they filming anything?  Were they following them around with a camera?  Nah.  The new season's going to start, I think, in January, is it?  Correct.  Yeah.  And he knows what it's all about.  He's like, it's a reality show.  He goes, I'm trying to get into real stuff.  I'm hoping that this at least parlays into something else. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  He understands what the reality show thing is all about.  You know, he's not taking it too seriously, because he's hoping that he could get something  else out of it.  He goes, he hates, I think every weekend he goes around the country, because that's how  he makes his money, doing the appearance here in clubs.  And he goes, I hate it, because I have to get drunk, and I'm not, I don't really like  drinking that much, but they expect, you know, Vinny from the Jersey Shore, or any guy from  the Jersey Shore, to just party their asses off, and that's what the club owner's hoping  for.  Yeah, they want to get...  So it's like, every weekend, I'm doing shots with everybody, and I don't want to do that. 
[00:32:30]  I don't want to make my money that way.  What do you think he gets an appearance?  I don't know.  Some of these guys do real well.  It's like, at least five grand.  Snooki probably gets the most, or...  Oh, sure.  Sitch does.  He gets more than her?  Snooki, yeah.  Really?  I would say Sitch does.  And they were all making fun of the Sitch, and how he shows his abs all the time.  It's hilarious.  Oh, really?  That's funny.  I had to keep my foot in my fucking pocket.  I had to show respect.  I should have filmed it, but I didn't. 
[00:33:00]  What is it, like $25,000 a show for him?  I'm just curious.  A show.  What?  For who?  Situation.  Oh, probably.  $3,500...  Wait a minute.  Oh, no.  It says, as of a year ago, Ronnie and Vinny are like $3,500 a person.  Probably more now, I mean.  Yeah, I think so now.  It's about five or six grand, I bet.  I don't know if this is an exclusive, but I'll say one of the guys, because there was  a bunch of them there, told me that Sammy Sweetheart, Sam would appreciate this, punches  Ronnie in the face in the upcoming season. 
[00:33:30]  Spoiler alert.  Yeah, I got a spoiler alert.  Wow.  Spoiler.  Sammy Sweetheart punches Ronnie hard right in the middle of the face.  I hope Ronnie goes into a rage.  That means nothing to most people listening to our show, but for that whole world, it's  a big deal.  It might be a spoiler.  I don't think I've seen that anywhere yet.  No, no, no.  It hasn't been shown anywhere.  Any type of domestic violence is a hit with our audience.  Yeah.  Yes.  Thank you, madam.  But I was more excited to meet the Karate Kid than Snooki yesterday.  Ralph Macchio.  Yeah, we're both from Long Island, so I actually talked about Long Island with the guy. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, an angle.  Which he appreciated, because everyone else was coming up to him going, hey, Karate Kid!  What up?  Wax off!  Wax off!  And I'm like, hey, fellow Long Island guy.  Knows the show.  Thinks the show's really funny.  And then I...  What show?  B.A.B.  And then I tweeted my picture to Jimmy.  I go, I bet you don't have the Karate Kid.  And this motherfucker, Jimmy, within seconds, you know, hits me back with his Ralph Macchio  pic.  No, it was the Karate Kid meets Kid McGillicuddy. 
[00:34:30]  That's right.  That was the picture Hope got back.  I was like, fuck.  Does he just still look like Ralph Macchio?  Dude, look how young he looks.  He looks good, man.  He looks really fucking young.  Yeah, I was way more excited to meet the Karate Kid than Snooki.  I thought it was going to be Jaden Smith.  Oh, see, that's because you're from that other generation.  Were people yelling to him?  Huh?  Everyone knew who he was?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He was a big...  He looks exactly the same.  It's not like one of those things where it's like, well, he kind of...  He probably can walk around because he doesn't look like that. 
[00:35:00]  Exactly the same.  Like Leif Garrett, who nobody would know.  No.  He couldn't be nicer.  He goes, I will never come on your show.  He goes, I would never come on your show or Howard's show.  I go, why?  He goes, because you guys want me to talk about stuff I will never talk about.  I will be a very boring guy in your show.  Don't talk about sweep the leg, Johnny, or nothing?  He's like, I know what you guys want, and I'm not going to give it to you.  Wow, fuck.  Because when I meet these people, I'm like, I hope you do our show someday.  He's like, I will never do your show. 
[00:35:30]  He goes, I think you guys are funny and stuff, but I will never do it.  Whoa.  But he wasn't being a dick about it.  He was being completely honest.  He goes, because I know what you guys are hoping for, and I'm just not that guy.  You should put in a request for him immediately.  Yeah, and see what happens.  Yeah, there's really not much.  Did he have a marriage scandal or something?  What would anybody talk about?  Did Pat Morita ever finger your butt on?  Yeah, like, what is he thinking?  He hasn't really been the king of scandal.  Maybe there is something.  I don't know.  I think it's more that we would push, push, push, and he just doesn't go that way, I guess. 
[00:36:00]  I don't know.  Speaking of football, I watch The Blind Side.  Dude, wait, can we take a break?  Sure.  Because this could take an hour.  I saw it myself.  Wait, you saw it too?  I did.  And that, interesting, I did.  Did you guys see it together?  No.  No.  Oh my God, finally.  How awful would that have been if I said, I saw it, but I did too, and I was like, oh yeah,  we were together.  But this is a break we should have done six months ago.  Oh, no, you know what? 
[00:36:30]  It shouldn't have been, because we're us, and we would never have seen that movie right  when it came out.  And now everybody's seen it.  Yeah, it's like on pay-per-view.  By the way, I should plug it, because the Karate Kid was all excited.  He goes to me, did you see my Funny or Die video?  And I have, and it's funny, and it's doing really well, so check it out.  Ralph Macchio makes fun of the fact that he was the Karate Kid on Funny or Die.  It's a big viral video right now.  Well, why couldn't we talk about that on the show if he was a guest? 
[00:37:00]  I would love to hear all these stories about his flight to Okanawa.  I tried.  Yeah, Okanawa.  So really, were you and Mr. Miyagi friends off the air, go.  I wasn't just hanging out.  I was working for the show, man, and I couldn't get it done.  Did you want to be part of Cobra Kai?  So wasn't that the cooler dojo?  Ah!  You should have told them that you were the Gregorio kid.  Yes.  I was the Long Island kid.  Talking about Long Island.  Yeah?  Where was he from? 
[00:37:30]  He was from Huntington.  Yeah, yeah.  But then, because that was my angle.  I was talking about Huntington.  But then I think he moved out to like, is this too local?  I think maybe Smithtown, somewhere out there maybe?  Yeah, somewhere out east, a little further east.  I can't believe, but he started, you know, his life in the Huntington area, where me and  Anne are sort of from.  Didn't we all?  Yeah.  All right.  The Blind Side, I can't wait to hear that after the break.  Also.  Yeah. 
[00:38:00]  Hold on.  I'll tell you when to do it.  Big.  Okay.  Do you have many problems with the movie?  No.  No.  Eh.  Couple, but nothing.  I don't think Sandra Bullock should have won the Oscar accolades that she got.  No, we'll get into that after the break.  Yeah, yeah.  Also, you heard about what CNN did, right?  What?  What they did.  The news.  Oh, fuck.  You didn't hear?  Who is that bitch?  I didn't hear.  They fucked up bad.  Yeah?  You really don't know this one?  Someone fired, maybe?  They call themselves Fox?  You don't know this one?  Try to get more viewers.  Yeah. 
[00:38:30]  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  You don't know that one?  No, that's great.  All right.  We'll have that for you next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus.  The Sirius XM.  Hey, let's not forget, you got that big Fox Woods poker tournament this Friday, right, Ann? 
[00:39:00]  This Friday, the big poker tournament.  We haven't talked about it that much, but it's going to be a good time up there in Foxwoods.  Oh, hell yeah.  Going to have a great time.  Go to foxwoods.com.  Get all the details.  Are you right on the front page, hopefully?  Yeah, they'll find it.  It's somewhere up there.  I don't know.  You know how it goes.  But you're playing poker.  A bunch of the listeners playing poker.  What's the grand prize?  A bunch of the listeners.  You know something?  Not sure yet.  Okay.  Not even sure.  I just know there's going to be a lot of poker.  Going to be some money going back and forth.  We might do some of the bounties at each table. 
[00:39:30]  There might be somebody, if you take them out, you get a little extra.  Is that the front page?  Yeah.  Look at that.  That's great.  Play poker with Anthony from SiriusXM's The Opium Anthony Show, December 17th, with Jimmy Norton.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  I'm actually looking forward to that.  I don't play poker.  I'm just going to go hang.  Yeah.  Who else is coming up?  Do we know?  Is Patrice coming up?  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  Patrici going to be coming up.  Is he playing?  Hanging out.  I don't know.  Yes.  Does he play cards?  He will be.  He's going.  My brother's going to be up there because he's actually playing. 
[00:40:00]  And the Hard Rock in Foxwoods.  Fuck, I would like that.  Is he?  That night.  Yeah.  So after the game, I'm going to go over there and maybe warble out a few tunes with Joe.  It's just going to be one of these insanely fun weekends.  That'd be great.  What band is he bringing?  I think it might be 2U.  It might be acoustic.  I don't know.  It might be his Marshall Tucker cover band.  You never know with Joe.  What the fuck?  But it's going to be fun.  He's always got something going on.  That's awesome.  Wait, aren't there two comics going up?  Like Patrice and isn't Bob Kelly going or no? 
[00:40:30]  I'm not sure.  Bobby might go?  Why are those guys going?  Just to hang out?  Yeah, man.  Definitely Patrice.  I might play.  Can I play?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I guess if you wanted to, they wouldn't stop you.  Of course you could.  I want to play war.  You want to play war?  You should just play willy-nilly.  Dude, I don't know how to play.  Yeah, that'd be beautiful.  I want to play cards.  It would be great.  I bet you would win.  I bet he takes out the whole table.  He'd at least take out quite a few very angry people.  Iraq's playing.  Are you playing, Iraq? 
[00:41:00]  Iraq, do you know the subtleties of the game?  I know.  It's a no, by the way.  Dead money.  He doesn't.  Dead money.  All in first hand.  What?  All in first hand.  Oh, no.  Here he goes.  Knocks out a lot of guys, though.  He could double up.  Yep.  No matter what cards you have.  Well, within reason.  Oh, I thought you were just going to go blind, like, not even look at your cards and just  push all in.  Oh, maybe I'll do that then, yeah.  Push all in. 
[00:41:30]  Flip them over.  See what happens.  Yeah.  Jesus.  That's cool.  Foxwoods, this Friday night?  Friday night.  That's right.  It's this Friday.  Holy shit.  That's why we're talking about it.  Make sure people know about it.  I'm going to L.A. tomorrow for one day to shoot a piece for Leno for next week.  I forgot.  I come back right and go to that.  Yeah.  Oh, cool.  It's a busy little week.  We listen to you this week.  Paul McCartney tonight.  I leave tomorrow after the show.  I'm only not here Wednesday.  Oh, okay.  Good.  I'm back for Thursday and Friday.  I forgot it's Friday. 
[00:42:00]  We only have a few shows left in this fine year.  I know, but then you do lose me for a couple days.  Unfortunately.  Because I have to go out and pitch the piece to Jay and I'm doing Chelsea Handler.  Unfortunately.  For SiriusXM, there will be a couple of days.  But I'll be here.  Lucky for you guys.  But unfortunately.  I'm sorry.  I'm yelling.  And the Borgata tickets are on sale for January 15th.  Late show.  It will sell out.  Not as fast as the early show, but it will sell out.  It's already, I think, halfway there.  Oh, nice.  Very good.  Good to hear.  Fucking great. 
[00:42:30]  Vinny from Jersey Shore wants to play this Friday.  Hey.  He's in.  Well, he's trying to reschedule something because he really wants to hang out with the O&A crew  and play some poker.  So, Foxwoods, this Friday.  And, of course, you're going to stay there the whole weekend.  Oh, hell yeah.  When's Joe playing?  Friday or Saturday?  I think Friday night.  Okay.  That's fag.  Friday night.  Good to see him.  And, uh, yeah, we're taking the, uh, we're taking the, uh, limo up there.  Oh, boy.  Nice.  And, uh, also, whoever's gone, we'll get the, the treat of a lifetime. 
[00:43:00]  Uh-huh.  Mom and Sal are also making the trek.  Oh, boy.  With us in the, in the car.  Oh, boy.  So, I have a nice long drive with Mom and Sal.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Are they going to play, too?  Uh, I don't think they'll be playing poker.  They're going to be over at the three-card poker, probably, and, and blackjack, and the  slot machines.  You know, old people games.  Mm-hmm.  Am I taking a, uh, I don't know how I'm getting up there.  I think I'm getting a ride.  Ooh, you better get a ride.  Is Kenny going or no?  If not, let me tell you.  Yes, I believe he is. 
[00:43:30]  I got the, uh, what they call the, uh, super stress.  So happy that Kenny didn't hear me say that, because he would have walked right in.  I am going.  And then leave.  Yeah, that was me.  I actually switched microphones.  Yeah, just to do it.  Yeah, that was weird.  You know how I go.  I'm method and shit.  I don't forget.  Uh, The Blind Side.  You guys finally saw the whole movie.  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Saw The Blind Side.  Um, I was actually snoozing on the couch.  I had watched one movie, and then I woke up right when The Blind Side was starting. 
[00:44:00]  And have you ever been too lazy to even change the channel?  Oh, of course.  I'm not making excuses.  This is just a movie I probably never would have watched, because I really don't care.  Uh, but I just kind of laid there, I'm like, what is this?  Is this?  Oh, okay.  It's The Blind Side.  Eh, fuck it.  Let me watch it.  Oh my god.  I, this, was this based on an extraordinary true, uh, story?  Is it?  Oh, yeah.  I'd love to know how much of it is true. 
[00:44:30]  Did you see the end of it?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where they show the real people?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, it's true.  I know, I just...  Well, they pump everything up for Hollywood.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know.  I, uh...  That's the real...  I didn't mind the movie.  I hated Sandra Bullock in it, though.  It's like she played that...  She was that take charge woman.  Hey, look out.  Don't stand in her way.  She won an Oscar for this, right?  I know.  Her acting sucked.  I thought she was good and serviceable.  Like, Denzel and Trin and Dave was good, but not Oscar worthy, I thought.  Of course not. 
[00:45:00]  Well, who else was she against?  Wasn't there somebody that really should have gotten...  Sam, can you look that up?  Danny, of course, would have had it already up.  But I mean, uh...  Precious?  No.  Her co-star?  Yeah, I didn't think the girl who played Precious was, uh...  She should have won the Oscar, either.  No.  Although, her role was a little fucking deeper than Sandra Bullock's.  Look at that big lumbering dummy.  That's all she had to do.  That's all she had to play the whole movie.  At least she played a fucking miserable person.  Dodged fucking shit that her mother was throwing at her.  Sandra Bullock. 
[00:45:30]  She ate pussy in that movie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Helen Mirren.  What else?  She beat Carrie...  Okay.  Put that...  Hold on.  Sam?  Sam.  Sam, you gotta put it back, Sam.  She beat a dame?  She beat, uh...  Gabriel...  Gabori, Meryl Streep, and Julian Juliach.  Um...  Carrie Mulligan in education.  I thought education sucked.  It was boring British shit.  Helen Mirren, I did not see.  The last station.  And Sandra Bullock.  Yeah, the competition wasn't what it could have been.  Yeah.  You don't beat Helen Mirren, ever. 
[00:46:00]  I don't know.  I don't know how she was in that.  How do you say her name?  Helen Mirren, yeah.  And the Oscar goes to...  Sandra Bullock for The Blind Side.  She was, uh...  It was a basic Hollywood movie.  I was Twittering the entire time.  Really?  Good for you.  Yes.  Inspirational tweets.  What did you hate about the movie?  The fact that Black and White got along...  No, I'm kidding.  I hated the...  I thought I was speaking for that guy.  What I hated was little things like the fact that it was, uh...  I...  Like, there's a scene where Big Mike comes over, and he sleeps, and then they show the 
[00:46:30]  next morning he's not on the sofa, and the sheets are folded.  Yes, yes.  And the music's like...  And it's like, what's the implication there?  That Big Blacks don't fold the sheets?  Yes.  Like, that's what was annoying.  I was looking at it like he never would have done that.  But these little things that white Hollywood does...  There was a lot of little things that were, like, so guilt-ridden, and just...  Just...  Like, pandering, insulting, pseudo-veiled racism, and... 
[00:47:00]  Like, they don't mean it to be insulting.  Like, I hate...  By the way, I hate the way my Twitter page comes up on the computer.  Me and Ozzy are both hidden.  That's good.  That's a good one.  I suck.  I don't like the way they always...  Like, they had the young black kids...  The young white kids and the big 17, 18-year-old black guy relating.  It's like, he's not a child.  He's a fucking man.  Well, he was a little...  I don't know how much of it was true, but...  And I like how Sandra Bullock's white friends, when they were having their little luncheonette,  their little luncheon thing, and they're talking about, you know, 
[00:47:30]  aren't you worried about having him around your daughter?  Your teen daughter.  The daughter was hot as fuck, by the way.  Oh, my God.  And they're like, aren't you worried about having that big you-know-what running around your house?  In person.  Like a maniac.  And, you know, he's the most polite thing ever.  I didn't like the fact that in the redneck game, it's like, I mean, sure,  don't tell me that one guy didn't at least mumble nigger.  Yeah.  Don't tell me that didn't happen. 
[00:48:00]  Of course.  Because they were all...  She's calling them deliverance, and they were all rednecks.  Don't tell me that one guy didn't mumble that.  I know.  In the stands or in the...  Come on.  Yes.  If it was that much of a racial thing, that's what annoyed me, but...  Yeah, they can't go there, though.  I guess they didn't want to go the distance with that.  They just didn't go there.  I dropped a little tear at the end.  No, you didn't.  I did.  No, you didn't.  I'll tell you when.  When?  When the newspaper article about his friend getting shot at the end.  Oh, right.  And she's like, that could have been my...  Like, I felt bad.  Because they showed the guy kind of tearing up, getting sad, looking at him at the party.  It was one moment.  It was like, eh, one guy got out, one guy didn't. 
[00:48:30]  Right.  With that part.  And then you see the real photos.  It was like, all right, that was nice.  What about when she went to the ghetto to rescue him?  Oh, God.  She took on all the gangbangers.  Yeah.  Even though she was wearing high heels and a short skirt and a tiny little pocketbook that had her fucking gun.  Deep dick in her asshole.  Oh, hell yeah.  In two seconds.  She would have got out of there alive.  That's not based on reality.  That didn't really happen.  The only line I liked in that last part...  Why is my fucking me and Ozzy covered on my Twitter page?  How do I fix it?  I suck. 
[00:49:00]  That'll bother you now, right?  I don't know how to do it.  I just want to do it right.  I did like...  I did it right the first time.  ...that she said...  Oh, there we go.  I did like the one line she had, which is, I'm in a prayer group with the DA.  I like that she said, I'm in a prayer group with the DA.  I'm a member of the NRA.  Yeah, but I like the fact that she was in a prayer group with the DA.  Prayer group.  That made me kind of juggle, yeah.  Whoa, we got a little knowledge for everyone today.  Thank you, Happy Butt, for Man Arbor.  The daughter is Phil Collins' kid.  Yeah.  Really?  That's what he's saying. 
[00:49:30]  The daughter in the movie.  I'm just going to blindly believe this guy.  In the movie?  Yeah.  Bumper up.  Bumper up.  Phil Collins' kid is a little movie star.  Let's see if there's a resemblance.  She's sexy.  How old is she, first of all, if I say it?  No, you could say it.  Oh, you could definitely see a little Phil Collins in there.  Yeah.  The hairline?  Yeah, with my sisudia in there.  Oh, Jim.  It's awful for a 16-year-old.  16?  That's too young.  I don't know.  I don't know how old she is.  How old is she, Sam?  Please get a bio.  Sam, come on.  Get a bio, you queer.  She was born in a bio or something. 
[00:50:00]  Shit.  She was born in...  No, that's Phil Collins.  In 1943.  She was born in March of 2009.  No, wait a minute.  How come you can't find this?  Oh, Sam, you are shit in a bag.  That's fine.  Jesus.  Sam.  How do I fix my Twitter profile so that mine and Ozzy's picture comes up together?  You can't.  It's like Canopy.  Nope.  Lies.  Nope.  She's a model for Tommy Hilfiger?  Nope. 
[00:50:30]  I was hanging out with...  And then she lived with Mikey Big...  I love the rhyming game.  Me too.  I gotta say hi to Andy Hilfiger.  Andy.  That's Tommy's brother, who I was hanging out with yesterday at the Jets game.  Look at all this going on.  A lot of connections going on.  Who else did you talk to?  Steve Klein?  Or fucking...  Or Larissa Karen?  I will guarantee that Andy is listening to this right now.  He's also a fan of the show.  He has XM in his car.  Ooh.  Yeah. 
[00:51:00]  And also refuses to come on this very program.  Well, I mean...  She's 21.  I think he does some stuff with his brother.  But as soon as he walked up, I go, oh, okay.  Because I'm trying to figure out how Tommy Hilfiger looks.  Yeah.  And then his brother came up, and I'm like, oh, okay.  It looks like that.  Ah.  Then it hit me.  I know who Tommy Hilfiger is.  She's 21 then.  Okay.  Who's 21?  Phil Collins' daughter.  So she's well with him.  What happened with the 17 thing?  I must have been reading something from a few years ago.  It was written previously, yeah.  Obviously four years old. 
[00:51:30]  We can all do some math.  Yes.  She's aged.  Huh?  She's aged since the article was written.  Well, that's...  She's a little younger.  You think how this stupid Bernie Madoff even shed a tear that his own son committed suicide?  You think that finally got this scumbag piece of shit?  Because you know why he did it.  He ruined his own son to the point where his son tied, I believe, a dog leash around a  pipe in his apartment and hung himself while his two-year-old kid's in another room.  That's what this scandal did to his own son.  Because supposedly the son was clean, for the most part. 
[00:52:00]  They're still trying to get him on things.  Yeah, they're trying to get him.  And, of course, the lawsuits will just leave the whole family destitute and broken.  They're probably used to the high life.  But you think this unemotional fuck that's in jail for 150 years shed a tear on him?  Devastated.  You think he's devastated?  Devastated, yes.  He knows it's all his fault.  How do you know?  How do you know?  He seems like a fucking robot.  Your son...  His wife is screaming at him.  Your son doesn't hang himself. 
[00:52:30]  And then it's impossible.  He's devastated.  And there's been four other suicides...  Yeah, not family members.  Yeah, not family members.  What a selfish prick his son was.  The two-year-old kid is sleeping.  His wife's at Disneyland with the other kid.  And he sends a fucking email.  He doesn't even talk to his wife and make sure that the kid's taken care of.  Just the whole family of selfish cunts.  But I think when you're going to commit suicide, you don't...  You don't fucking leave your two-year-old there.  What if the wife didn't check the email?  What if her computer was broken?  Your brain's not in the right place if you're going to do something like that to yourself.  You're saying he's not thinking rationally before he hangs himself. 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, exactly.  From a pipe and a dog leash.  Just a selfish...  And I don't know if fucking Bernie shed a tear.  I really don't know.  I wouldn't just assume that.  Oh, I would.  He ruined so many people's lives.  And that never affected him.  He could care less.  What do you think he's doing to occupy his time?  He's in prison.  He's probably just sitting there fucking thinking about what he did.  He should fucking take his own life.  Yeah, we should hang him.  But we don't do that in America.  Like the old Roman legions. 
[00:53:30]  We don't do that in America, right?  We're civilized in this country.  Fuck that.  No.  Fuck that shit.  Yeah, he's a goodbye funny man.  A lot of tragedy.  Tragedy.  A lot of tragedy.  So CNN fucked up, huh?  Yeah, what the fuck is this?  This is classic.  This is one for the ages.  Jeez.  Let me just throw this in here.  Most people know what this is about, I guess.  I did not know. 
[00:54:00]  All right, in London, the government has just voted to raise the cap that universities charge  for tuition.  Thousands of angry students are outside parliament protesting.  On Capitol Hill, House Democrats have voted not to bring up the tax package that President  Obama negotiated with Republicans.  We didn't just put that on TV, did we? 
[00:54:30]  It's a good thing it's a tape show.  We'll just edit that out.  Was it audio or video?  Video.  Video.  How did...  It was fucking...  It was a part from Dumb and Dumber.  Dumb and Dumber, where he's having a problem and he's in the bathroom.  Who did that?  Just shitting his brains out.  Did that go out live?  Do we know the backstory?  I don't know the backstory to this one.  It did go out live.  I think he was being facetious when he said they got...  Let me see the video clip, because I've got to see their face.  Yeah.  Inexplicably airs Dumb and Dumber Diary a Scene.  Can you turn that slightly toward me, too, please?  Oh, yes.  That's great. 
[00:55:00]  I want to see this.  All right.  In London, the government has just voted to raise the cap that universities charge for  tuition.  Thousands of angry students are outside parliament protesting.  On Capitol Hill, House Democrats have voted not to bring up the tax package that President  Obama negotiated with Republicans.  We didn't just put that on TV, did we? 
[00:55:30]  It's a good thing it's a tape show.  We'll just edit that out.  That's funny.  Wow.  Did they do that on purpose?  Because now everyone's talking about it.  Why wouldn't you put that on purpose?  I bet they go back and forth beforehand and test some of the feeds with funny clips.  I bet the guy's like, it's a goof.  They'll test some of the feeds.  That was just sitting there.  And then that was sitting there, and he probably ran that.  Oh, is that classic.  There's just some tech guy that was laughing with his buddies. 
[00:56:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  It's going out.  Or maybe they're just watching the movie.  No, but it is the best scene in the movie, basically.  It was a clip because it said, Courtesy New Line Cinema on the top.  So, like, they probably said, you know, of all the silly slapstick in this movie, and  that would be the B-roll.  But instead.  It's on a new show.  And that bare ass and everything.  Pulling his pants down and sitting on the toilet.  Fan-fucking-tastic. 
[00:56:30]  Oops.  Isn't that great?  Any apology?  Not that I've seen it.  Not yet.  I'm sure there will be.  Not yet.  We'd like to apologize if anybody was offended by a diarrhea clip.  If you're offended by that, do we have to really care about those type of people in this  world?  No.  Why would you be offended by that?  Well, I happen to think that when I'm watching a news program with my family, I happen to think  that my family and I have the right to watch the news without being offended by fecal matter. 
[00:57:00]  Fecal matter, Jericho.  Fecal.  Goddamn Dr. Steve.  I love him and hate him.  What happened?  I do, too, except without the love part.  Oh, really?  Oh, I love him and hate him.  He didn't sugarcoat his diagnosis?  No, he didn't.  I sugarcoat it.  He sent me a lovely gift.  It was a big, like, one of those tower things, the boxes.  I got the tower of shit from him, too.  No, no.  It is a tower of fucking deliciousness that I cannot eat. 
[00:57:30]  No, I can't eat it.  Why?  Because I'll be a fucking fatso.  It's crazy good.  It's better to eat that than go downstairs to the tap.  Nah, I love the tap.  It's fucking liquid.  You piss it out.  No, I had a couple.  I had one of the truffles and some of the dark chocolate things.  It's really good stuff.  It's like, it's so good.  I'm like, Dr. Steve, what is he doing? 
[00:58:00]  I think we're going to re-wrap.  Re-gift?  Why not?  That's a great gift for some old person in your family.  It's very mean.  Huh?  It's very mean.  Why?  He'll never know.  Well, he will now.  I guess so.  If I don't really care about his feelings, so it doesn't matter.  Oh.  Oh, I have to get him something now.  I know.  Isn't that the worst?  It is.  But the thing is, Dr. Steve's cool, so I want to put a lot of thought behind it.  He's kind of hard to shop for.  And if you're listening, just pick something up and send it to Dr. Steve. 
[00:58:30]  Let me know what it is.  There.  There you go.  It's done.  It's the thought that counts.  Very nice.  A lot of thought was put into that.  I didn't.  I'm trying not to eat that stuff, though.  I'm trying to lose weight.  Yeah?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  I haven't done anything yet.  Hitting the gym?  I haven't done anything.  No, I mean, I've been hitting the gym a couple times last week, but I haven't lifted.  I've been very bad.  I was going to say hit the gym.  You should never say hit the gym unless you've been gone for a while.  Why?  Because it's like, yeah, I'm going to hit the gym.  It's like, no, you're going to the gym. 
[00:59:00]  You didn't let me finish.  I wanted to hit the gym with my fat tits in the stomach, so I did.  Someone on Instant Feedback reminding us about the subway guy.  Holy shit.  Ow.  I don't know if these pictures are making it to your town, but train and suffering.  Horror photos reveal torment of man pinned on subway tracks.  But wait, he didn't get trapped.  Like, the train...  I got to tweak this for the rest of the country.  The train wasn't moving.  The train wasn't moving.  It wasn't like what you see footage of when a train is rolling and a guy falls in front 
[00:59:30]  of the train and it wraps him up like a fucking Twizzler against the platform.  Yeah, this is a fucked up thing that happened.  There's a gap, obviously, between the platform and the train.  And there's all these signs that say, watch the gap, mind the gap, look out for the gap,  fucking watch your ass for the gap.  The gap, the gap, the gap.  He was standing by the door.  The train shut it off for a second.  I got to talk.  With this video?  Hold on, hold on.  That could be something else.  It could be another one.  He was standing by the door. 
[01:00:00]  He walked out and fell in the gap.  And then a hydraulic little extender for the platform that is supposed to protect people  so they don't fall through the gap extended itself and pinned him between the train and  the extended hydraulic thing.  And they couldn't figure out.  It took a half hour to get somebody to get the hydraulic little platform extender to  retract.  Why a half hour?  Because it's fucking anything city related takes a half hour. 
[01:00:30]  That was a half hour of him just screaming bloody murder?  They tried pulling him out.  He was like, no, it hurts.  And the way the platform extender comes out, it has this interlocking thing.  Like a claw.  So it's got like claws that went right into his belly.  Was he bleeding, you think?  Oh, yeah.  And there was only about two inches of space between the platform extender and the train.  He's in a coma.  He's cleaning a life now.  Yeah, he's fucking done.  But it's not as bad as it could have been. 
[01:01:00]  But what a terrible fuck.  It's as bad as it could be.  No, I mean with the train.  It wasn't like it was going to die.  The train's moving and they twist like a twizzler.  Oh, I've seen footage recently of a fight in India, I think on the subway platform or something.  There were Indian guys.  It could have been anywhere.  And the one guy got like the train was moving and the guy kind of hit the train and his arm gets caught under the fucking train and it's ripped off.  It's great.  That's sick.  Now the extender is for people that can't step over the gap.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:01:30]  We have to take care of the people that can't figure out how to step over the space between the platform and getting on the train.  And now this thing has fucked people up.  Right, because people were getting injured that way.  So then they came up with this extender.  Yeah, the extender that comes out.  Which seems way more dangerous, obviously, than a few people falling because they can't figure out basic shit.  Take your goddamn foot off.  It's, yeah, it's, you know what it is?  When you're getting off the fucking train, step. 
[01:02:00]  Don't fucking, people are sheep.  It's the same people that fucking see somebody cross the crosswalk where it says don't walk, but a guy looks and notices he's got enough time to walk.  And somebody will just start walking behind him without looking.  They just follow like sheep.  And then you've got to jam on the brakes and go and lay on the horn and go like, you just stepped into traffic without looking.  Dummy.  And it's these people that just shuffle along and fall in this gap between the train and the platform.  Is this the video of the guy? 
[01:02:30]  No, that guy looks a little twisted.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, that looks like a bad one.  This guy is really trapped.  How do they get him out?  Hey, back the train up the whole way.  Oh, he's bleeding bad.  Yeah.  His dick and balls are probably so fucking crushed.  That train's going to be delayed, I'd say.  A little bit.  That's going to be rough.  Yeah, cops just hauled him. 
[01:03:00]  He's like spun in half just about.  How horrible, man.  And then rumor has it, yeah, that the blood pressure stays.  Like a tourniquet.  Yeah, because it cuts off the blood to the wound.  So you don't bleed out.  You just kind of sit there until they get the pressure off.  Until they move the train and then your guts and shit fall out.  Yeah, and then your guts fall out and you bleed to death.  There was one story where the, oh, that was in Soho.  Wow.  Accidentally stepped into the gap between a subway car and the platform and had his leg trapped 
[01:03:30]  and brutally twisted after the train moved.  Oh, his leg was twisted.  I wonder if he might have lived then.  It was just his leg.  Yeah, he did.  It says he was taken to the hospital.  Non-life threat.  But his leg, yeah.  His leg's all fucked up.  Probably had to take his leg, right?  Ow.  Ow.  I was watching a show, I Survived, last night.  That's a great show.  Yeah, but they have a new one now.  The reenactments suck, though, right?  No, there's not real reenactments on that one.  I Survived.  It's just people telling the story.  What's the other one, then, with the dumb reenactments? 
[01:04:00]  I Should Be Dead.  I think you're right.  The I Survived one is now I Survived, and they have new ones where it's, uh, and came back.  Like, they died and came back.  And it's all these people that had fucked up shit happen to them.  One guy was on a motorcycle, and some truck pulled right out in front of him.  And he laid the bike down and wanted to push the bike away.  So he pushed the bike away, and he's sliding.  He slides right in front of the truck and grabs the truck so he doesn't slide any further. 
[01:04:30]  And then the guy runs right over his chest and stops with the front tire on his chest.  Why?  That wasn't very nice.  I know.  And then the guy's like, uh, oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you.  He goes, what, you see me now?  He goes, get the truck off me.  And that must have been the big mistake, because as he was backing off of them, the guy said he just heard, like, crackers crunching as he just crushed his ribcage and punctured his lungs.  And then he died right there.  He died, and he talked about how he saw his mother and his grandmother and the light and the warmth and the peace. 
[01:05:00]  And he didn't want to go back.  And it was wonderful and beautiful.  And then the mother said something like, you can't stay.  You got to go.  And then he heard, like, way off in the distance in this thing, he heard, like, we got a pulse.  And he felt himself being, like, physically pulled back.  And he opened his eyes, and he was, like, in pain again and all fucked up.  And it happened, like, and that's pretty much the gist of every story.  But it's how other people died, and very, very odd. 
[01:05:30]  It's all similar stories.  Does it make you believe a little bit?  I don't know.  It confuses you, right?  It's just like, eh.  You mean the fact that it's probably just a near-death hallucination that people, like a weird, they say that there's a thing in us, right,  like, that nature puts in, that it's been speculated, that has us worship a deity, which, because it could be a self-preservation thing.  Like, we have no natural enemies, so what would prevent us from complete anarchy or from just self-destructing would be this little thing in us, 
[01:06:00]  which gives us a natural bigger thing than us, whatever it is.  It would have to be moral.  It could just be a fuck.  Or it could just be God, Jimmy.  I'm not saying it ain't the good Lord.  I'm only saying it might not.  Praise the Lord.  Their stories always have this, there is our relatives, or the feeling of relatives, unless it's a literal, like,  one person saw literally their mother and grandmother looking better than they ever had before. 
[01:06:30]  They were both of, like, similar ages.  One wasn't old and one wasn't young, but he couldn't tell how old, really, but they just looked good.  Another person, it was a light and an energy that they knew was this person.  Just from the feeling that they got, she knew it was, like, this grandmother that was, like, hugging her or some shit.  And then there was always this feeling of, like, you can't stay.  And once you figure out you can't stay, you get really pissed off because you don't want to go back.  Like, you lose, they said you lose all concern or worry to want to go back and be part of this life where you have to worry about things and this, that, 
[01:07:00]  because it's just such an all-enveloping, great thing.  So why wouldn't you kill yourself as soon as you come to?  I don't know.  I think it gives you some kind of perspective or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And if everyone looks so good, let's call it heaven.  Yeah.  Then what?  Like, what do they do?  I think it's something that is way beyond what we can even imagine here.  It's something like, you'd be like, oh, I like, you know, I like riding motorcycles, so is heaven not motorcycles? 
[01:07:30]  No, it's some kind of very, I think, more cerebral happiness thing that you care about.  Can you still eat sushi?  Probably not.  Fuck.  I don't think there's any sushi.  No, because fish have to enjoy heaven, too.  Yes.  And I don't think there's a communal heaven, either, from what these people are saying.  Like, it seems like it's kind of family-based, whoever you loved, individualistic kind of thing.  So it's not like you've got to be happy and deal with, like, somebody halfway around the world that you don't know that died. 
[01:08:00]  I don't know.  Are you just floating around?  I don't know.  And everyone says that they do.  They get this floating thing.  They kind of look down.  They see their body.  They see the people working on them, but they don't really care.  They walk around.  Some of them leave the room.  Why does it always have to be down?  Because they float up.  But there's no up in the universe.  No, but in, like, it's like in a video game where it's got a bug and you kind of go through a level.  Right.  You know, you can float up and you, like, you go through the floor and you end up in this far where you're supposed to go up the stairs. 
[01:08:30]  That makes you think.  Yeah, it was fucked up.  My dad believed in all that stuff.  Really?  Researched all of it.  Near-death experience was his thing.  Well, if it's any consolation, everybody said very peaceful, very, you didn't care, and just relaxing, I guess.  It is simply a euphoria.  And I hate to be fucking chemi-curmudging.  A blast of chemicals burst into the head.  Just your brain firing out something so you don't realize what's happening. 
[01:09:00]  And it's almost like spaceships.  As technology advances, we know what we think spaceships should look like.  Uh-huh.  So we see them as they're always reported as such.  It's like the hallucination is we've heard for our whole lives that heaven, white light, family, so that's what people see.  Don't you think that...  No!  All right.  I don't.  We just gave everybody...  I just talk.  Don't you?  We just gave everyone hope out there.  I know.  And then Jimmy fucking ruins it.  Now, don't you think there would have been a study based on what chemicals were released into the brain?  Like endorphins and that. 
[01:09:30]  Sure.  And, well, nothing's come up for a death chemical except for, you know, decomposition after you're dead.  No one's really come up with a, this happens in the brain, this chemical is released that's never released any other time.  Because it may not be a death chemical.  It may be just the endorphin release or whatever.  And because you know you've had an accident or you're dying, your mind, that's the picture your mind just might paint.  It's like, you know what I mean?  It may be the same thing that's released when you have adrenaline or people that, you know, have an injury and they don't feel the pain or whatever. 
[01:10:00]  It's just some kind of a chemical thing that's probably happened.  I'm sure.  I hate to say that, but of course that's it.  What if there is some kind of just, you know, extension of your who you are thing, whatever you want to call spirit or whatever, an extension of that.  And this is just, you know, like birth.  Birth was part of making you.  You don't know what was going on before that, but birth was part of making you. 
[01:10:30]  You don't know where your soul was or who you were before that.  Maybe you were lingering around somewhere.  So then after, maybe this is just an extension of that.  You just keep going on and on and on.  Maybe.  Hope you're right.  Yeah.  Looks like energy can't be destroyed.  You know, it can only change form.  That's true.  Looks like someone hit middle age officially.  No, no.  I was just watching this.  I was just watching this.  It's true.  No atheists in foxholes or mansions either.  Please, God, don't let this end.  I make a lot of money.  No, there were people that were talking about there was this one woman and she was in some 
[01:11:00]  car wreck or some shit and her friend got like fucking decapitated and she got fucked  up and her heart stopped.  And she said both of them ended up together in this very warm, light kind of atmosphere.  And she knew that she had to go back, but the friend wasn't going to be going back.  Like you get all this weird fucking hazy knowledge thing.  And she said it was very comforting to the mother of the dead woman to be able to go and 
[01:11:30]  tell her that she went through this with her and she was very at peace.  And I'll bet you that the fucking girl who died had the same dream thinking I'm going  back and the other one isn't.  And she just drops dead and goes nowhere.  Same horseshit dream.  Everyone who's dead has it.  They think they're going back, but they're not.  They're going to fucking Samson's funeral home.  Samson.  The fucking McGillicuddy's funeral home.  Yeah, I should have said that.  Ted's funerals.  Well, why don't we go to Steve?  Steve, this happened to Steve.  Yes. 
[01:12:00]  Steve in Jersey.  I had an after work experience.  Good morning, guys.  Hi.  Hello.  How are you?  Better now that you called?  Oh, hold on, hold on.  Breaking news.  Great Neck, Long Island.  Somebody broke into some teenage girl's room.  I used to live there.  I used to live in Great Neck.  Yes.  I never broke into a teenage girl's room.  Can we get that story, please?  Yes, I know what that's all about.  Go ahead, Steve.  Okay, Steve.  Okay. 
[01:12:30]  When I was younger, like 17, 18 years old, and I'm going to be 50 soon, I was doing a little partying,  but it wasn't enough to cause what happened.  Smoking some pot.  You know, it was in the 70s, the intergalactic space bomb.  And the next thing I remember was screaming for help, and then, like, hitting the floor, seeing, you know, exactly what you're describing, seeing myself laying on the bed.  You were high. 
[01:13:00]  Exactly.  No, no, it's a lot more than that.  All right.  And then the next thing that I can remember was that same white light tunnel.  It felt like a warm tunnel that I was being kind of sucked into.  Very, very peaceful.  I remember telling my brother, who was a freshman in college at Rutgers, and that's where I was, and I was a senior in high school.  And I remember telling him, it's okay, don't worry, it's fine, it's not a problem, you know, I'm okay. 
[01:13:30]  And then the next thing that really happened was the EMT that was giving me mouth-to-mouth because they lost my heartbeat.  I just remember the air, like this feeling like, you know, that was bringing me back.  And it took me years to reconcile what happened because I just figured, well, this is such a nice thing.  Like, why the fuck am I back?  Like, why didn't I just go?  It makes you feel like, well, was I, you know, did I do something wrong that I, you know, I wasn't worthy to go wherever we're going? 
[01:14:00]  Oh, well, that's probably it.  Are you scared to die now?  Yes.  I'm just, I'm 50, but I'm just starting to get back to the point where I'm okay with dying.  But for a long time, I was afraid to die.  I was afraid of everything.  I was a neurotic friggin' mess.  And, you know, you would think that that would have maybe taken me the other way, but it didn't.  It left me kind of fucked up for a while. 
[01:14:30]  And, you know, my brother got his ass kicked because he's the one who had all the pot, and I was only this little high school boy.  What the fuck kind of pot were you smoking?  Well, they tested it.  They tested, remember, back then?  It was angel dust.  Power of quat!  Yeah.  Nothing.  Your brother Rufy just put it in your butt.  Well, according to, Sam brought this thing up.  According to this doctor, Carl Jensen, who sounds like a German, ketamine, which is a drug, can reproduce all the main features of, well, I wonder if Dr. Steve would feel the same way, too.  Ketamine can reproduce all the main features of near-death experience, NDE, including traveling through dark tunnel into the light, but the feeling that one is dead, communicating with God, hallucinations, out-of-body experiences I wasn't finished, strange noise, etc. 
[01:15:00]  This does not prove that NDE is nothing but a set of physical responses, nor does it prove there is no life after death.  But there is a drug that reproduces it.  I hate to be the bearer of bad ketamine.  Rogan would love to read that.  I'd love to have some ketamine. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, Rogan has a whole thing on this.  Actually, someone knows what Rogan says about this.  Thank you for your story there, Steve.  We're going to Graham in PA.  Graham.  Hey, what's going on, gentlemen?  Hey, you got something on this?  What's that?  Yeah, speak and be spoken to.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  Yeah, I was just calling.  Finally, Joe Rogan and Doug Stano did some drug called DMT.  I guess it's like dimethyltryptoline or something.  And it's a synthesized version of the chemical that your brain releases when you die.  And that causes hallucinations. 
[01:16:00]  Yeah, no.  Okay.  Rogan has...  Yeah, so that's like a chemical little burst.  And then what?  You see a light and you feel warm and you don't want to go back into your body or something?  Oh, no.  That's what fucking Joe Rogan was saying.  I think that chemical is like something that helps your consciousness transition or something  from when you die.  Yeah, that's what I think.  All right, brother. 
[01:16:30]  Thank you.  We got Dr. Steve on the line.  Dr. Steve, is there a heaven?  Go.  Dr. Steve, you...  Now, as a little preface here, first, I'd like to say Dr. Steve works with a lot of people  who are right there on the friggin' teeter-totter of death.  Right on the front line of heaven.  One foot in the grave, the other on a skateboard, and you have a lot of...  The pillow in your hands.  Yes.  In your checkbook.  A lot of experience with this.  I think you would be knowledgeable on the thing.  What's your take on this whole light, warmth, seeing family, being brought back from the brink 
[01:17:00]  of death or from death?  What's your take, Dr. Steve?  Well, you know, I have to tell you that one of the reasons that I'm doing hospice work  is to deal with my own mortality, which means I have no answers whatsoever.  Ah!  All right.  That's wonderful.  No answers.  But I do see people who...  See people.  Well, you know, we have some measure of control over the time of our death, which is interesting. 
[01:17:30]  How's that?  I see people frequently...  See people.  What?  I don't know.  See people.  They're called women.  See people.  Okay.  I guess.  I do see people frequently who say, you know, I'm just waiting until my cousin Joe from Kokomo  shows up.  And then when they show up, then the patient dies. 
[01:18:00]  God, they should never show up then.  What the fuck?  It's like, and you could tell that that person was waiting for their loved one to show up  before they died.  It's like, hey, then don't show up.  Yeah.  See how long he...  Hold on.  How many people die right before husband Joe is in the lobby and just miss him when he's  getting a coffee like Terminator 2 in the lobby?  You bring up a great point, Jim, because we don't pay attention to those times when it  doesn't work out that way. 
[01:18:30]  So there may be a selection bias there where we just think people have control, but it  just is that we remember the times when people were waiting for somebody and then they died  after they showed up.  Now, have you ever had an experience with somebody that left this mortal coil and then  came back and told you a thing or two?  Yeah, I've had two patients who have had near-death experiences.  And both were in for broken fingers, thanks to your bungling. 
[01:19:00]  After drinking his wine, near-death experiences and then complete blindness.  Sorry, Dr. S.  Yes, of course.  Go ahead, sir.  Near-death experience, two patients.  Two people who've had it.  And it should be noticed or at least pointed out that if they came back from the dead, that  they were not actually dead.  Ah, see.  The definition of dead is that they actually die.  You're from that school of thought.  Now, the heart-stopping isn't necessarily dead. 
[01:19:30]  As long as there's still some oxygenated blood going through the brain, I guess you're not  technically dead.  Heart-stopping, that's an old definition of death, the heart-stopping, but now that we  have the ability to bring back people, usually around 15% of the time, I will add, 15% to  30% is about the best we could do if someone heart-stops to get them to, you know, come  back to a reasonable quality of life. 
[01:20:00]  Old kickstart.  You know, that whole scene in The Abyss where he does a coat blue on his wife after he drags  her through the ocean.  I don't remember if you remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  The stern does CPR, and then she gets up and is running around through the rest of the...  It's sadly a myth.  It doesn't work that way.  Not quite.  Yeah, they had some people on the show last night that were like, they were out for 20,  30 minutes of heart stoppage, but they were getting constant CPR on their way to the hospital, 
[01:20:30]  and they didn't have any signs of brain damage or anything, so I guess it does happen occasionally.  It definitely can happen, and kids who fall into cold lakes can be resuscitated...  Uncle Paul.  Five minutes to an hour after they're, you know, presumed dead, so there is that.  They're in a state of sort of suspended animation because of the, you know, this thing called 
[01:21:00]  the diving reflex that slows down our metabolism.  So, so you're saying that if you come back from the dead, it is proof that in fact you were never dead.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Yeah, all right.  Because the definition that we use of death now is irreversible cessation of brain activity.  Right.  So, so E-Rock is technically dead.  Yes, exactly right.  Look at his not even, he doesn't even smile anymore. 
[01:21:30]  He just shakes that giant meatloaf in a wig that he calls a head to.  Jesus.  All right, Dr. Steve.  All right.  It was interesting finding your take on the whole thing.  I don't know.  You know, I kind of have, I guess I'm a little conservative on that, although I'm definitely  open-minded.  They've done studies on people with this near-death thing where they have an operating room where  they routinely stop people's hearts, and they've put a message on one of those scrolling 
[01:22:00]  signs that nobody can see unless you were floating above the operating room.  Ah, there you go.  Okay, that's interesting.  And so they did this to look at this, and not a single person came back and said that  they had seen the message.  Great.  Another buzzkill.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  When someone says they're floating over their body, they would have been able to see this  message, like, hey, get back in your body, or something. 
[01:22:30]  That was pretty clever.  That is pretty goddamn clever.  This study was run for years, and nobody brought it.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Wow.  There's no fucking heaven.  Thanks, Dr. Steve.  Very interesting.  Wonderful.  You know, a negative isn't proof.  It's not true.  That is true.  That is true.  Dr. Steve, thank you also for your wonderfully generous gift of stuff that I really can't  eat.  But it is very delicious.  And he did write on it that Danny and Keith will probably eat most of this. 
[01:23:00]  Of course.  But thank you very much.  Very thoughtful gift, sir.  You'll be getting a weird medicine Bristol stool scale mug in the mail.  Oh, well.  What the hell?  I'm running home right now.  You can check your stools while you're drinking your cup of morning joe.  Wonderful.  Wow.  Dr. Steve, thank you again for your knowledge.  All right.  Have a great day.  You too, sir. 
[01:23:30]  Dr. Steve, everyone.  Jake in Jersey.  Jake.  Hey, guys.  Just to bring it all around, Penn and Teller on their show, I believe, either the first  or second season actually did the...  Bullshit!  No.  I'm just naming the show.  Yes, of course.  And they actually said that pilots in the centrifuge, after they black out, they had the same thing.  And what's also weird to me is no one ever sees hell.  Everybody always goes towards the white light.  How fucking big is heaven? 
[01:24:00]  Well, maybe there isn't a heaven and a hell, per se.  Per se.  Per se.  Per se.  Per se.  Maybe there's just a place that you go when you die.  That's, you know, this energy mass that you have some recognition of past experiences.  No, you're not buying that?  Yeah, fuck that.  All right, Jake.  Thank you.  We're going to leave this morbid subject and do something. 
[01:24:30]  This morbid subject.  And do something next after the break.  Paul McCartney at the Apollo tonight.  We're all going.  Yes, the Apollo Theater.  It's going to be a good time.  First time I'm going there, by the way.  Me too.  Me too.  Yeah.  Where else would we go?  Why would we?  Have you ever been to the Apollo, Sam?  No, I used to watch the show when I was a kid, though.  Live from the Apollo.  Of course I did.  After SNL.  And Paul McCartney's making the rounds.  He was on SNL this weekend.  And we're going to give you a little taste of him doing Jet.  A little taste.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:25:00]  Paul McCartney sounded good on SNL, huh? 
[01:25:30]  Well, talk about a taste.  What?  Talk about a small taste.  That's what a taste is.  That was a little less than a taste.  Get with the program.  That's a taste.  I think that was like when you smell something that you want to taste.  You think?  Yeah, yeah.  That was a sniff.  A little sniffle?  Yeah.  By the way, from I think it was Friday's show already.  By the way.  Big A doing the news with E-Rock and the drill sergeant bit.  I cut up a couple videos for the peeps. 
[01:26:00]  Oh, yeah.  He's puking.  It's hysterical.  That was very funny, actually.  I watched that with my chick.  I watched the E-Rock.  Bad breath news was very funny.  He's turning red and dry heaving.  Fantastic.  Poor Big A.  And then I added the drill sergeant bit that Jimmy came up with.  So they're both up on the YouTube channel, OP Radio.  And then we got the Facebook page happening again, right, Sam?  Opie and Anthony?  Yes.  Facebook.com.  These videos linked?  Oh, yeah.  They all link up on the Facebook page.  All right.  So, yeah.  You can go to the Facebook page, Opie and Anthony. 
[01:26:30]  You can see the Big A videos.  Big A's breath.  You know.  He can handle it.  It was a bit gamey on Friday.  Gamey?  It was a bit gamey.  And E-Rock's expression.  He's trying to do the news inches from his face.  Very fucking funny, man.  Hilarious.  And then Jimmy coming up with the drill sergeant bit.  So check it out for yourself in your downtime.  Hey, our mayor doesn't want to be president.  Good.  He shouldn't be.  Well, rumors are floating that he's posturing to run for president. 
[01:27:00]  But he insists and swears, I guess, that he is not going to seek that office.  Because he wants to be known as the greatest, watch Jimmy's face, the greatest mayor of all time.  But I'll tell you what.  Financially, he's a smart guy.  But that asshole, when there was a bomb found in Times Square, who knows who it could be?  It could be somebody who's against health care reform.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You really want that dumb motherfucker dealing with foreign policy?  He's way too left. 
[01:27:30]  He can go fuck himself.  What a dope.  Well, no, we knew exactly who did it.  Everyone knew who did it.  Everyone knew.  Please.  Everyone knew it was Islamic extremists.  Everyone knew it was probably a Muslim.  And he wouldn't say that.  He would never, ever.  And he's like one of those apologists who will never criticize Islam or Islamic extremism.  He'll say, you know, who cares?  It could be a suicide bomber named Frank.  That's the type of thing he would say.  No, it's not. 
[01:28:00]  He's not.  And he says he's not running.  He says he wants to go into, you know, charity work and all that.  No, he says he has a lot more bike lanes to make.  Is that what it is all over the country?  He needs to make more bike lanes.  I don't like Mayor Bloomberg whatsoever.  He's going to shut down 95 in the entire state of South Carolina and just make it one big, actually, no, just a place with tables and chairs where you can sit out and traffic will be bypassed to side streets.  Take care of the tourists.  You can't.  Oh, I know. 
[01:28:30]  I did the tourist thing this weekend.  Did you?  I saw the Christmas tree.  Oh.  Then I saw the ice skating rink.  Did you have people up or down or somewhere?  I had people up.  There's some scams going on around that tree, man.  Yeah?  Good one.  I saw some pickpocketers.  Oh, yeah?  I saw, and we have something in common.  I saw a Santa Claus get arrested.  Yeah, yeah.  You saw pictures of a Santa Claus.  I saw pictures, yeah. 
[01:29:00]  I saw actual Santa Claus is getting arrested around the tree because, and we fucked them up by accident.  It was our fault.  We saw that they were brown bagging it.  And we said something like, oh, right on.  And then they had to show us what was in the brown bags.  And I'm thinking to myself, we already know that it's alcohol, you dopes.  And, man, they were on them, the undercovers.  Was that for SantaCon?  SantaCon, well, I was, yeah, I guess it was part of SantaCon.  Did you know about this?  I only knew when Keith the cop told me about SantaCon. 
[01:29:30]  He was working SantaCon.  This fucking generation has something going on.  God bless him.  Can you imagine if we had SantaCon in this shit when we were growing up?  SantaCon is a day where it was this past Saturday in New York.  I think it was all over the country in a bunch of cities.  And I don't know how the word got out.  I'm assuming it was Twitter or something?  No.  I'm assuming it's a Facebook.  It's been around for a few years.  So maybe it started on MySpace where everyone gets together, dresses like Santa Claus or some kind of Santa Claus Christmas type character. 
[01:30:00]  I didn't see the jizz represented in SantaCon, by the way.  No one dressed like a menorah?  No, I didn't see any.  Or a dreidel, dreidel, dreidel?  Didn't see any Jewish characters.  This was all about Christmas.  And everyone just starts drinking at 10 a.m. dressed as Santa Claus.  There were Santa Clauses all over the fucking place this weekend in New York City.  Yeah, I heard a couple that I saw pictures of.  Let me see.  I was on the way to the cellar. 
[01:30:30]  And I just saw a group of them in the village.  I'm like, what the fuck is this?  It must have been at the end of it.  Oh, yeah.  It was a night.  They do travel in packs.  I ended up down in the village where you went to John's Pizza.  Voted second best pizza joint in all of New York.  Yeah.  What's the first one?  It's in Brooklyn.  Rays?  Rays.  There's a Rays on every corner.  Romaldi's or something like that?  John's in the village is second best?  Yes.  You've been there?  On Bleecker Street?  They only serve pies.  They only serve pies, my friend.  I should go there.  If I haven't been there in a while, I'll go there. 
[01:31:00]  This week, maybe with my broad.  Don't get the pasta.  I made a mistake and got pasta at a piece of joint.  No, not at John's.  Nothing better than a cuffed Santa at the desk.  Can I see that?  Are you allowed to tweet that?  No.  Oh, that's too bad because that's a great one.  I'd just leave that.  That's a great one.  Not for public consumption, but it is pretty funny.  Dummy.  Went up down at John's and Bleecker Street, and that was probably the epicenter of this Santa  con.  There were thousands of Santa clauses.  I tweeted a picture of this girl who was literally comatose.  And because I called her a shit-faced hoe, I had the women's groups on Twitter fucking 
[01:31:30]  beating me up.  You wouldn't call a guy that was that drunk a whore?  I called him a shit-faced asshole.  I just said shit-faced hoe.  Douche.  Doing the ho-ho-ho thing.  I was going with a Christmas theme slash that she might be a hoe.  Did you put shit-faced hoe-ho-ho, or did you just put shit-faced hoe?  No, then I went fa-la-la-la-la.  La-la-la-la.  I don't know.  That's a little sexist.  Shit-faced hoe in the la-la-la.  I was called...  Making her way to the la-la-la.  Sucking a la in the la-la-la. 
[01:32:00]  I was called the sexist pig on Twitter.  It's like, why are you following me then, you asshole?  Could be worse things to be called in worse places.  She was comatose, and the story goes, it's really simple, and I wish I fucking filmed it.  I was stupid.  But they were trying to get her in a cab.  She was done for the day.  Santa Cotton was done for her, even though it was like two in the afternoon.  And all of a sudden, the cab pulls up, because Santa Claus waves down the cab.  The guy's thinking he's got a Santa Claus fare.  No problem.  All of a sudden, they open the door, and they're trying to throw this mess in the back seat. 
[01:32:30]  She's not even awake.  She's completely gone.  My picture captured it perfectly.  And the cabbie finally realizes, what the fuck?  Jumps out and starts screaming, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  No.  And then everyone was getting pissed at the cab driver.  And I'm thinking, I was on the side of the cab driver.  He doesn't want to have to deal with this shit.  Puking in his cab.  And if she ends up puking in the cab, then he's done for the day.  If she fucking has an alcohol OD in the cab, then what? 
[01:33:00]  If she wakes up and has some hallucination that the cabbie fucking touched her inappropriately, but she was hammered?  Yeah, that's fucked up.  Then there was a screaming match, and it almost came to some of that fisticuffs with the cab guy.  Because the cab guy was insistent, and these guys are saying, what the fuck?  And they're getting really pissed, and they're trying to hold the door open and shove her in anyway.  And finally, the cab driver won.  And I was thinking, good for him.  He doesn't want to have to deal with her because she decided to get completely fucking snotted at two in the afternoon. 
[01:33:30]  Hold her liquor.  Hold her liquor.  She wasn't even conscious.  I wonder what happened to her.  Yeah.  Yeah, I got a picture where a friend is just holding her up as her neck is completely, or her head is completely forward.  And she's being dragged on her heels.  Dragged on her heels.  Like her legs are straight out.  They're picking her up under her arms.  Can you get that for Jimmy?  And dragging her by the heels.  It's like they're pulling wounded off the battlefield.  And her skirt was completely hiked up.  Nice. 
[01:34:00]  My brother-in-law got some panty shots.  I missed the panty shot.  I fucked up.  I fucked up.  I fucked up.  That's why you got to go with the vid.  Well, at one point, this is how they were trying to get her.  You're absolutely right.  This is, at one point, the guy put her over his shoulder.  So panties for everyone to see.  That's how he was trying to get her in the cab.  Jimmy, look at this picture from SantaCon.  That's like someone's just being hauled away after being shot.  God, look at her legs.  If I was the cabbie, I absolutely would have fucked her up front. 
[01:34:30]  Yeah, put her up front.  I'll make sure she's okay.  Pinty the whole way.  I would have made this noise if I pinched her around.  I was like, meh, meh, meh, meh.  What was I going to say?  Yeah, she was fucked up.  Her hair is down in her face.  Just fucking gone.  So the chicks dress like little sexy Santas?  Oh, my God, yeah.  Really short skirts.  And then everyone thinking they were going to be the only buddy from the Will Ferrell thing.  Buddy the Elf. 
[01:35:00]  There were so many Buddy the Elfs.  It wasn't even funny.  And then, can you show Anthony the other picture?  Anthony said he's seen this before.  Go the other way.  On the way home, I saw a cabbie, another cabbie, stopping pretty much in the middle of the street during his shift to pray to Allah.  Have you ever seen this, Jimmy?  No.  Yeah, I've seen.  He put his rug down on the sidewalk, and he did his thing.  He's facing Mecca.  Yeah, because the sun was going down, and he was doing his thing. 
[01:35:30]  You know what?  Not one person fucked with this guy.  Nah, people don't usually fuck with religious people.  I don't even mean that, but maybe just say something.  And people were like, don't even mess with this at all.  Because people mess with everything in New York City.  Well, you'd get a fucking hate crime put on you in a second.  No, I don't mean they should have, but everyone was well-behaved.  You know what I mean?  Huh.  As the guy just put his rug down and started praying Allah.  Oh, he put his wig down.  If you ever give toupee, you should keep it on.  Too wordy. 
[01:36:00]  But that Santa con looked like a blast.  Looks like a pain in the gas.  A bunch of drunks dressed like Santa.  The bar's down.  Great time to knock off a bank, though.  Yeah, right?  It was like Santa.  What do you look like?  He looked like Santa.  Yeah, great.  We have 20,000 suspects.  The bars were just filled.  Some of these bars, I think, wouldn't even let you in unless you dressed like Santa Claus,  because you would look in the window, and it was just a sea of Santa Clauses.  Oh, I'm just doing my Santa. 
[01:36:30]  People were asking me if this girl was hot.  I couldn't tell, because her head was completely forward.  The hair was in her eyes.  Some people said her thighs were a little beefy.  I didn't think her thighs were beefy at all.  I wouldn't let you know.  Huh?  Hard to tell, because I don't think that's all thigh.  I think that's some ass there, because her skirt is being pulled up by the other girl's  leg, because she's slumping.  Sure.  So I think I see a lot of ass there.  But, and then I went to St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, yeah?  Well, it was the tourist day.  It was a tourist day.  We had a family in town.  And some asshole, I'm going up the aisle.  He goes, hey, take your hat off.  It's a church.  So then I take my hat off, because I think it's a church official.  I'm like, oh, fuck.  All right.  I'll show a little respect.  You know?  Even though everyone else is there just to take pictures.  No one's worshiping or praying.  Most people are in there just to, you know, to get warm for an hour or two.  Have sex.  Sex, possibly, whatever.  And then I look and realize he's just a fucking idiot. 
[01:37:30]  He has nothing to do with the church.  Of course not.  Well, he didn't want you messing up God's house with your hat.  That's disrespectful, to have a hat on while talking with the deity who created black holes in the universe and stars and space-time.  God's like, hey, remove that thing from your head.  Fucking assholes, people are.  Go fuck yourself.  God doesn't care.  God made hats.  He had to wear one when he crucified them.  Nice. 
[01:38:00]  Why do we have to take our hats off at times?  You don't.  You should have said to that guy, compared to what I got in trouble for in this place last time, a hat ain't nothing, pal.  That's only the second time I've been there since the incident.  And I think about it every fucking time.  Yeah, don't sweat the hat there, pal.  Yeah, we did a lot worse.  Or you take the hat off and just put on a yarmulke.  See what he says.  His head would explode.  There you go.  He'd be very confusing.  That's what I do now.  Or take the hat off and put on a bozo wig.  But why do we take the hats off? 
[01:38:30]  Why do we take the hats off at sporting events when they do the national anthem?  I don't know why.  Crown of Thorns?  Or Stars, Bang of Banner, whatever they want.  It's out of respect.  But what's the respect part?  Can't you show respect and still have your hat on?  What is the respect part of removing your hat?  I'm sure it's some oldie time thing.  Yeah, I want to know what it is.  It's to ensure you didn't have a weapon under your hat.  I could keep my hat on at a hockey game if I was still going to hockey games.  And the guy next to me could take his hat off.  And I'm showing more respect even though I have my hat on in my fucking soul. 
[01:39:00]  So what is it about?  Who started it?  I bet you it was a president, right?  The president probably had an itch.  It's JFK.  Took his hat off and itched his scalp.  Next thing you know, everyone has to do it from now on.  That's how half this shit starts, though.  Oswald itched his scalp pretty good.  People decide not to answer the phones today, I guess.  Oh, boy.  Oh, gee.  Just ring in and ring in and ring in. 
[01:39:30]  E-Rock, what's the problem in there?  No, we see it in here.  Troy's been answering the phones and putting all the comments up.  So it's operator error, not machine error.  Troy.  Mars is gone today, so there's been a few bugs.  I think I found the answer to your hat question.  Oh, good.  All right.  Good, Sam.  Well, it appears that hats were worn outdoors regularly to protect one's hair and face from dirt outside.  Which would suppose to assume that continuing to wear one's hat indoors would be an insult to your host, insinuating that their place is as dirty as it is. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, that's bullshit.  See, it's all horseshit.  It starts out as horseshit, and now we have to continue doing it.  I'm not buying that, though, as an explanation.  I show respect with my hat on.  I don't buy that at all.  Is there a second explanation?  Yes.  Grimaldi's.  Because wearing the hat is your way of saying that the host's wife is a cunt and you hate her.  Wow.  All right.  I shouldn't wear that.  Well, we ought to get the hat removal expert in there. 
[01:40:30]  He was good.  Well, look, he taught that lady manners.  He sure did.  Keep her hair.  A man removing his hat when he entered a household was an ancient vestige of a man removing his helmet as a gesture that he trusted the host.  Not to swing a sword at his head.  You know, I was goofing when I said to make sure he didn't have a weapon under it.  Every one of these things always goes back, like the handshake, to some kind of, I want to make sure that guy isn't trying to kill me move. 
[01:41:00]  It's like, well, the handshake is you walk up and make sure that their right hand is now occupied and cannot draw a sword on you.  What if they're left-handed?  Then they got the jump on you.  A lot of southpaws won.  Then why is there more southpaws in this world?  I don't know.  Because you killed them before they got a chance to get the jump on you.  Right.  You just kill them all.  Taking your hat off indoors shows respect just like extending your middle finger shows disrespect. 
[01:41:30]  It is just a convention we have agreed upon.  All right, I'll agree with that.  That sounds more reasonable than a stupid ancient Roman war helmet.  A Roman war hat.  Let me just put my balls and cock on your head.  That's dumb.  Yes, that is stupid.  Anything on the phone is worth going to?  Because I can't tell from here.  No.  Let's judge by history.  No.  Hey, we started with Bloomberg.  We actually have audio of how he wants to be the greatest mayor of all time. 
[01:42:00]  If I just came to you and said, you know, Mr. Mayor, we've taken a hard look at this.  We think this would not just be a vanity play.  You could actually win this thing.  No.  Would you change your mind?  No.  No way, no how.  Thank you, God.  No way, no how.  So your supporters who create all this buzz should cease and desist?  I don't think most of them do create this buzz.  I mean, yes, they should cease and desist, but most of this is just because the press wants to have something to write about.  But the bottom line is, I've got a great job.  I want to go out having a reputation as a very good, maybe the greatest mayor ever. 
[01:42:30]  And I'm lucky I have three predecessors, Giuliani and Dinkins and Koch, all of whom have been very helpful in trying to make me a better mayor.  Oh, really?  Dinkins?  How?  How, Dinkins?  You didn't like the Dinkins?  Ugh, what a waste of time that whole fucking mayorship was.  That was our shot at the black mayor?  Every city gives the black mayor a shot.  Yeah, that was a good one.  Boy, he was fantastic, wasn't he? 
[01:43:00]  Running to fucking criminals' bedsides while a cop is fucking shot in the hospital.  Not stopping the riots and fucking Crown Heights.  The Jews and the blacks beating the fuck out of each other.  Actually, the blacks beating the fuck out of the Jews, but, and the Jews, you know, bleeding all over the blacks.  I wouldn't say of course to that.  No?  I mean, Crown Heights just...  The Jews don't play, man.  No, they don't.  Oh, no, no.  They don't fucking play.  Yeah.  They take care of each other pretty well, too. 
[01:43:30]  Well, they, uh...  Dinkins was just a horrible mayor.  Wasn't the economy bad, though, when he was the mayor?  Well, he...  That was old school New York, right?  Yeah, that was the last kind of bastion of old school New York that you see in the old...  gritty movies and stuff, uh, where there's a lot of crime, a lot of shit going on in Times Square and stuff.  And then Giuliani came in, and what was the difference there?  He was able to fucking fix things.  You know why?  Giuliani was fucking hated, but he knew what the city needed. 
[01:44:00]  He knew what the city needed to be a money-making tourist attraction venture.  But a lot of people don't like it.  A lot of the old school people, a lot of people like the, you know, porn shops all over the place and stuff.  But if you wanted a city that was going to make money, that business was going to come to,  then Giuliani did an amazing job.  And, uh, and Bloomberg is just riding the, the, the tails of that.  I mean, he wasn't the one that...  He's brought a lot more business in, because he is a good businessman. 
[01:44:30]  But as far as being a mayor that's in touch with the people, and knows what the people in New York need and want,  there could not be a person that is further from that than fucking Bloomberg.  He's completely out of touch.  Out of touch.  The guy does it.  And the worst part is he thinks he is in touch.  He really thinks he knows what New York City, what the people in New York City wants and needs.  He's getting rid of our trans fats.  He's getting rid of our salt.  Yeah, you know, that's fine.  He's giving us bike lanes.  He's giving us a lot of trees.  He's...  I, I just... 
[01:45:00]  What else is he doing?  He...  The commute still sucks, so thanks for that.  Yeah, he's fucking with the, the, the infrastructure.  I don't understand why he's worried about...  I, I, I like riding my bike, by the way.  So I would probably, I probably should be for this.  Well, then how about bike paths that only bikes take?  I've seen them on the west side and shit like that.  There's plenty of those, by the way.  You don't have to put them in the fucking streets and take a lane of traffic away.  My biggest problem with this, um, city and Bloomberg is, you know, doing all these dumb 
[01:45:30]  little things when there's real issues out there.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, the commute into New York is, officially kills people.  Yeah.  People have heart attacks because of the stress of getting in and out of this fucking place.  And instead of, like, acknowledging that and go, wow, we gotta really figure this out  and it's not gonna be an easy solution.  They just kind of ignore all that year after year after year.  And then they're like, oh, let's put, let's plant some trees.  Let's, let's put another bike lane in.  Let's close down half a Times Square to traffic.  Yay.  The tunnels, the bridges, the, it's just, it's a nightmare living around here. 
[01:46:00]  I like the tunnels being cleaned at night, though.  I think that's important.  Holy shit, yeah, why?  I like a clean tunnel.  I love a clean tunnel, don't you?  Why do you need a clean tunnel?  I don't even care if a vagina's clean, much less a tunnel I'm driving through.  Yeah, that big douchey truck that drives through.  Right.  What a pain in the ass that thing is.  Get around it.  I mean, to, to be the greatest mayor of all time, you gotta tackle some of these really  tough, tough things that are going on and fix them.  Nothing's better than being, here's somebody that's out of touch. 
[01:46:30]  When you change traffic patterns to the point where you are maybe a block and a half away  from where you need to be, but they fucked up being allowed to turn, not being allowed  to turn, you can do this, but you can't do that.  Where you have to go in the opposite direction that you want to go for blocks on end in order  to turn around.  No turns, no turns until Park Avenue.  And you're like way on the east side, you're facing the wrong way.  It's like, now I gotta go to Park and fucking make a right and then come back down the other 
[01:47:00]  way?  Well, that's to keep traffic moving, though.  It doesn't work.  If it doesn't work, then that's stupid.  It doesn't fucking work.  And again, oh, again, Friday, I got in a fucking yelling match with a cab driver.  Of course you did.  A cabbie that fucking was in my straight arrow lane waiting to make a left turn.  And he's right in the middle the whole time.  And then the last minute, he curves his car over to the left, but still blocks my lane.  Sure. 
[01:47:30]  And I miss the light.  Now we're neck and neck.  So I just roll my window down.  I go, you, and he looks at me first and goes, motherfucker, because I beeped at him.  I go, I'm the motherfucker?  I go, roll your window down, you fucking savage.  You can't drive, prick, motherfucker.  And people are just laughing.  I love entertaining the masses on the sidewalk.  And why would he curse at you?  Because I was beeping at him in the heat.  And you know why?  Oh, I fucking hate that.  He had no clue.  He had no clue why I was beeping.  I just drive.  I drive my town car and you beeped me. 
[01:48:00]  I was drive.  Now, you don't know what you're doing.  I was drive.  I was drive.  Did you tell him?  Get the fuck.  I said, I went, I went, there's two lanes here.  One a turn left.  And he's just going, fuck you.  Fuck you.  Do you know how hard it is sometimes?  I believe me.  I really, I don't know how you do it.  There are reasons that you and I did not apply for the same thing.  Exactly.  Oh, you dirty fucking finger going up.  Oh, that's what it was.  But the thing is, I'll also, I will come so close to their cars as they take off. 
[01:48:30]  Now, the light turned green.  And I came so close to his car that he beeped his horn and pulled his car over.  Like, he thought I was going to hit him.  I'm just laughing.  Fuck him.  Goddamn savages.  When you look at his fucking punch, his face.  I would love it.  That's why I'm sorry.  But when I hear that a town car driver was found slumped over the wheel with a bullet to the back of his head, I can't feel any fucking sympathy.  Who'd he cut off?  Because they're all fucking scumbags. 
[01:49:00]  I hate delivery car drivers.  They're not the cabbies.  I'm not talking about every fucking yellow cab driver.  I'm talking about the black Lincoln Continentals that drive around with these fucking, these fucking excuses for life in it.  They don't know how to drive.  They're amongst the worst drivers I've ever seen.  They don't know how.  Do you understand how many of these side streets, and we call them side streets because they're not like the big avenues in Manhattan,  but any of these side streets that have two usable fucking lanes at any given moment. 
[01:49:30]  And then we'll use one.  And what?  These motherfuckers are using it like a runway.  They're right down the fucking dotted white line.  There's plenty of room on either side.  It's a move!  Using it like a runway.  I hate these people.  Anthony's commute is nothing compared to everyone else's.  Oh, believe me, it's nothing.  The hours I commute, it's not a lot of traffic.  But it still drives you nuts.  It drives me crazy because I know it's a 20-minute drive from door to door.  It's a 20-minute fucking drive with no traffic. 
[01:50:00]  I understand the way home there's going to be more traffic, but it's not an hour's worth of a fucking drive.  Right.  Get out of the way.  Oh, get out of the way.  We've got a lot of tourists in town.  Yeah.  Because they're doing their Christmas shopping.  They come in in December.  The pedestrians are a whole other story, man.  When I'm trying to get around, again, the left turn and straight arrow thing,  if there's somebody, and now I've got to squeeze a little further to the right to get around them,  and I've got a green light?  Forget it.  Why the fuck is a pedestrian standing in the street? 
[01:50:30]  I don't know.  They're not on the sidewalk.  They're in the crosswalk, standing in the lane I'm using.  How many have you brushed?  I've brushed a few.  No, I don't brush anybody.  I brush.  I lay on that horn.  I don't hit.  I brush.  The window's down in a second, and I'm yelling, you fucking asshole.  If you know your vehicle, the side view mirror, you could do a little brushing.  I don't brush.  Just a little bit.  No.  Not a hit.  A brush.  And like I said, I have my fingers on the mirror, fold in, fold out,  because the Escalade, the whole mirror is fold in and out. 
[01:51:00]  And there are some times I'll be looking going, yeah, this is a fold in.  Fold it in.  Boom.  Shoot between a double parked car and something else.  And then fold them back out.  But you should fold them back out and slap someone in the face with your side view mirror.  Yeah, believe me, I'd like to.  I wouldn't like the lawsuit that would bring.  You've got to brush.  But you can't brush.  You do a sharp right turn, and you're brushing right at the last moment.  You can't brush.  You're going to get.  A little brush.  You're going to get arrested.  Not if they're.  And you're going to get sued.  Not if they're in the road.  Pedestrians always have the right of way.  I'm not hitting.  I'm brushing.  Always.  Brushing is a hit. 
[01:51:30]  I'm brushing.  A brush is a hit.  I'm brushing.  Brush is a hit.  You're gearing up for a lawsuit, my friend.  You got it.  The animal that took out my side view that time, I didn't get a lawsuit on that one.  No.  Because he brushed you.  One of the scariest fucking moments ever.  That is a big motherfucker.  I looked right at his, I want to kick your ass face when he knocked your mirror off your car.  Everything you're talking about where the guy's just taking a sweet old time while we had the green light.  Oh, that was it, yeah.  And I decided to tap him.  Because he was being an asshole.  And I learned quickly that I was in the wrong fucking place. 
[01:52:00]  This guy, I know we've told the story, but for the new listeners.  This guy in one punch took out a very complicated, involved side view mirror.  He just smashed the fucking thing and then just grunted and walked away like big foot.  No way.  And we just, we locked our doors and we just took it.  A couple of fags.  We took it like the sissies we really are.  A couple of fags.  It was, he took it out though.  And he was doing something that I can't stand either.  It's, a lot of times there's traffic across the intersection and I know I can't go. 
[01:52:30]  I have a green light, but I'm not going to be the guy stuck in the middle of the intersection.  I don't do that.  Right.  So there's traffic on the other side.  I'm waiting.  Now I still have a green light.  I have a green light.  No, that's the, you got to go somewhere else.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  We'll take a break soon.  You can figure it out.  Yeah.  Uh, I have a green light.  I know it looks like we're not doing much in here.  I understand.  I know.  Uh, but.  People are just coming in and working.  I know.  Grab my mouse right in front of me.  I understand.  It looks like we're doing absolutely nothing, but we're actually trying to entertain people. 
[01:53:00]  Holy shit.  You didn't hear me get scared.  I heard you go.  Ah, ah, ah, ah.  That's very funny.  That's very funny.  To me we're startled.  There's a black fan in the studio.  People will use the opportunity when I have a green light, but they know I can't move, to now cross in front of me.  I don't have a problem with this.  You might think I did.  I don't.  But, before you do that, look over at that traffic.  And make sure it's not moving.  If it's starting to move, don't fucking cross in front of me.  Or if you are in front of me, hop up your pace a little bit.  Because I want to get through the intersection. 
[01:53:30]  It doesn't mean all of a sudden the don't walk now means just walk because I stopped.  It means I didn't want to block the intersection, but now that it's clear, I'm fucking going.  And I will lay on that horn.  And when they are about a foot away from the front of my vehicle, then you lay on the horn.  Oh, do they jump and get angry?  You got to brush.  No brush.  Give him a little brush.  Can't brush.  I hate it.  The guy just came in.  First of all, he's using...  I don't know what he was doing.  He distracted us. 
[01:54:00]  He's using my computer.  Which, by the way, I don't have control over this screen.  This is just a monitor for me to see what phone calls are coming in.  I don't think I have control either, really.  But your mouse might work.  Yeah, your mouse works for that, right?  Oh, I got other things.  Mine works for my left computer and my laptop.  So he was working the mice that weren't even connected to anybody.  As Jimmy screamed in horror.  Post text not attached to show, exclamation point, one nine, zero, zero, one. 
[01:54:30]  Zero, zero, one you're getting?  I'm going to say okay to that.  Yeah, say okay.  Waiting for show, OA host.  I'll say cancel that.  That's you.  You're the host.  Did I do good?  You're not helping.  What?  They're trying to...  Your monitors are linked to the other room.  So in the other room, they'd be trying to fix this.  I was just helping them out.  No, you're being worried.  I just clicked on some things.  Opie, put everyone on the air at once.  I don't know if I can.  No?  Can't you just click all of them?  Oh, I can't even click.  Uh-oh. 
[01:55:00]  Oh, they fucking...  See, that would be fun.  They froze me out.  They froze me out.  You were being a hindrance.  Yeah, they fucking...  My father used to say that.  Be a help, not a hindrance.  A hindrance.  I hated the word hindrance.  And I apparently was being one a lot.  You were a hindrance.  I was the hindrance kid.  Oh, yeah.  You're old hindrance McKillagunny.  What am I saying?  I wish I could McKillagunny.  I'm a fat pig.  I just keep mistuffing my gutty.  A boo. 
[01:55:30]  That's a good idea.  Not for me, for Ann, because I don't really drive as much anymore.  JD in New York City.  Opie, you need a little rascal's boxing glove attached to your side mirror.  Oh, wouldn't that be great?  On the little accordion thing?  Yeah.  Yeah, and you just pull a lever and the big red boxing glove punches people in the face?  No, you don't want that.  It'll hit somebody.  Oh, Jimmy.  Troy sent the engineer in?  Why?  Why did he do that?  We're doing a show.  He was trying to get the phones back.  You know what the interesting thing was?  Yeah.  Is I was in the middle of talking. 
[01:56:00]  I know.  And he dove right in front of me.  I mean, literally right in front of me, which kind of can break your concentration a little bit.  I'm sorry.  Did I break your concentration?  So it was just a little, you know.  Oh, Troy coming to defend?  Are you coming to defend yourself?  No, I...  Sorry, my fault.  I was just trying to get the phones up and running for you guys.  So I sent him in.  So it's my fault.  He came right here.  Like, his head came right in front of me.  Right in the middle of talking.  It was the honest thing.  It was very difficult. 
[01:56:30]  But I'm a professional.  So I overcame that.  Well, Jim got scared.  And that was even more of a discussion.  And Jim got scared because he's never...  We never really see someone running past or something.  Jimmy doesn't see black people.  No, it's because there was a black man on the street.  Jimmy doesn't see black people.  He gets very scared when he sees them.  I just got frightened.  I held onto my backpack and yelled for the police.  Help!  Help!  I'm scared of you, sir.  And I'm protecting myself.  I'm protecting myself.  I'm scared of you.  Please call the police.  Thanks, Troy. 
[01:57:00]  That's okay.  Hey, what is this...  He's just a young go-getter.  What is this Paul McCartney-Jimmy Fallon thing about?  He was on Jimmy Fallon's show.  And he said the original lyrics to Yesterday were Scrambled Eggs.  I think we knew that, right?  But then they sang it together.  As Scrambled Eggs?  Yes.  They had a little fun, was it?  They had a little fun.  Fucking Laura Michaels gets Jimmy Fallon really good guests.  That's true.  How does Letterman not get McCartney?  Or did he have them?  Not that I'm aware of, but I could be wrong. 
[01:57:30]  It might have been a whole NBC thing.  He did SNL and Jimmy Fallon.  Oh, Lorne.  Of course.  Just hooking it up.  Like, yesterday, I know the original lyrics...  Because back then, you just wanted to remember the timing of the words.  The original lyrics were Scrambled Eggs.  Scrambled Eggs.  Oh, my baby, I love your legs.  Yeah.  That's how you remembered the song yesterday.  Yeah.  Have you never performed the original Scrambled Eggs?  I haven't ever done the original version, no. 
[01:58:00]  I was wondering if you wouldn't mind, would you like to perform it tonight?  Scrambled Eggs?  That's what I do?  Yeah, you're welcome.  I do it with you.  Thank you.  Hello.  Come on, let's do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do that.  I can do it.  Do you remember the words?  Yes.  Scrambled Eggs.  No, Scrambled Eggs.  Scrambled Eggs.  Scrambled Eggs.  Three, four. 
[01:58:30]  Scrambled Eggs.  Oh, my baby, how I love your legs.  No, I wanted to hear the version that he did about Scrambled Egg. 
[01:59:00]  Scrambled Egg.  Scrambled Egg.  Oh, how I love your, well, you know, leg.  Paul McCartney's doing a song parody, though.  I know, right?  Was he shoehorning?  No, I don't think he was. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, I love your thighs.  Not as much as I love waffle fries.  Oh, have you tried the waffle fries?  They are so damn good that they should be illegal.  Oh, they're like regular fries, but they're shaved like a waffle. 
[02:00:00]  That's true, honey.  Chicken wings.  Chicken wings, no, no, no.  Chicken wings, vegetarian, no chicken wings.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, hey.  Get them mad.  You're gonna do it all day. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, did you bring the tofu wings?  Now go home and get your fucking shine box.  That's the place I know where I go for kick-ass wings.  We could even get a side of onion rings. 
[02:01:00]  Be more funny.  Go get some scrambled eggs.  This is going great.  Boring.  Jimmy Fallon got to sing with Paul McCartney. 
[02:01:30]  Of course, that's great.  That's pretty fucking cool, right?  Doing a song parody.  I know.  Doing like a Scott and Todd thing right there.  Oh, shit.  Not even close, though.  I apologize, Scott and Todd.  No one is as great as you guys when it comes to the song parody.  I'm looking forward to seeing him tonight, though.  Hell yeah.  Scott and Todd?  No.  Of course not.  Paul McCartney at the Apollo Theater.  The Apollo Theater.  All right. 
[02:02:00]  Well, uh...  You think it's gonna be a predominantly white audience in the Apollo Theater?  I would think so.  McCartney?  You're joking.  Yeah, I was kind of joking.  How do we get there?  Is that one of those practice, practice, practice places?  Take me to the bad part of town.  Yeah.  And then the cabbie...  Yeah, when you say...  When the cabbie asks where you want to go, and then tells you no.  Well, the best part when we come home tonight, when we hail a cab and they go downtown, they  scream, thank God.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  Thank you so much. 
[02:02:30]  I thought I had to go even further north than this.  I hope I don't have to stand out long for a cab or anything.  I should get a car.  Why don't you drive up there?  What?  I've got my car on the fucking Henry Hudson on blocks.  It's kind of like Peter Luger's.  You pay the homeboys to watch your car.  Or in other words, you pay them so they don't have a Luger.  They have a whole deal.  I don't know.  Gun joke.  What?  I don't know if it's still happening, but where Peter Luger's is, remember?  Yeah.  You pay the homies, the locals, to watch your car. 
[02:03:00]  Oh, that's good.  You park it right on the street, and you pay them.  They're walking everywhere.  And how it goes is, you know...  Is how it goes?  They don't touch your fucking car if you pay.  Like, don't they fucking...  It's called extortion.  Of course it is.  It's not called parking.  It's extortion.  But it is a real deal, and it's not like they're scamming you and taking your fucking money.  It's a real deal that that area has figured out.  Do you leave them the keys to valet it?  Can't you valet it, Peter Luger's, or no?  I don't know.  It's been years. 
[02:03:30]  But, yeah.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be a very good steak there.  Damn.  It's amazing.  Is it really that good?  This is ridiculous.  Old school.  Cash only?  You know, wooden tables that you could just fucking stab your steak knife right into.  They don't care.  It's crazy.  You can call your initials.  They don't care.  A fuckload of amazing meat.  Cash business.  I'm going to have my pants.  42, and I made that joke.  I have a nice meat joke.  And I'm laughing at it.  It's true.  And you're 52.  I'm not.  No, you're not.  The Opie and Anthony show on the virus. 
[02:04:00]  Virus.  Sirius XM.  All right.  Moving right along.  Got to give that sleeves credit, man.  That is a funny fucking song.  I knew you would like the sleeves.  Well, it's a funny song.  You like the sleeves.  I like seeing you humiliated like that, Ant.  I don't like, well, yes, the humiliation.  He will pay.  But, no, that's funny.  Funny, funny, motherfucker.  And that was funny.  I know we talked about it earlier, but the coach, Tripp, and the Dolphins player is just, 
[02:04:30]  what are you doing?  I know.  Like, what are you doing?  Giving your job away.  Sir, that's a bad move.  Yeah.  He leaned in.  I wonder because, I wonder if his knee was out of bounds, if that's okay and that's going  to save his job.  No way.  No way.  Fucking no.  He fucking way.  Unless the knee wasn't on the fucking field.  Doesn't matter.  No way.  He gave that little bend.  He's so fired, right?  A little bend to the knee, like, hey, just take that with you. 
[02:05:00]  What are you thinking?  He went crazy.  I know the team is in shambles right now, but.  It really is.  Much like our.  New York Islanders?  No, no.  Our studio.  Yeah, I know.  Because I usually have a wonderful big cup of ice, and I just, oh, Kenny, it's okay.  I just see Kenny get up, I'm like, ah.  Well, why would Kenny help out?  Too busy taking care of Kenny, laughing, having fun.  I didn't want to have Kenny have to get up. 
[02:05:30]  I feel bad.  You did.  You said to me, where's that bum in my ice?  Look at the CNN footage of the Pats game.  They didn't show this in New York yesterday.  Yeah, it's just nice and snowy.  Old school snow fucking game.  God.  I love watching those.  When you watch games like that, you really can't tell what year the game is.  Right.  Like, it's like, wow, is this an old game?  Why would the NFL take that away from the fans?  Um, revenue.  With the dumb domes.  It's got to be revenue.  It's got to be revenue, you think? 
[02:06:00]  Everything comes down to the almighty dollar, I think.  Because everybody wants to see a snow game, right?  Yeah.  Unless it's a big game and your team really needs to win to get in the playoffs, and then  they've got the shitty conditions, and you're a little bummed, like, oh, fuck, this is going  to fuck everything up.  But, in general, man, there's nothing better.  You don't see the mud games anymore, because that's pretty much...  Mud games are great.  The fake grass is everywhere.  Yeah, the mud games are always great, though.  Let's see who really was in the action that day, because it just covered...  Covered in...  Yes.  ...brown... 
[02:06:30]  The good old days, I like to call them.  Sure.  We've got Michael Madsen calling in.  Michael Madsen?  In a few minutes.  I still miss the white...  Roland says that he says his new movie is shit, and he doesn't want to talk about it.  So why is he calling in, then?  But he's talked about a lot of his shit movies.  One of the best times we ever had was when he explained each movie that he hated and why  he did it?  Yeah.  That was great.  Well, this is one of the most interesting facts I've ever seen on a little promo sheet 
[02:07:00]  for a guest.  According to IMDb, Michael Madsen is working on 28 projects.  How are you working on 28?  How do you work on 28 projects?  Thank you, Kenny.  You're welcome.  You're as cold as ice.  You're willing to sacrifice...  That's far enough.  Yeah.  You like that, Chip?  Sure.  Ice is cold.  I told the girl one time. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  We were kissing.  She said, Chippy, your breath stinks.  I'm like, you're as cold as ice, woman.  I just showed her.  Yeah.  Was she right?  Yeah, it smelled like peanut butter.  And I would take an antidepressant.  Is your mouth dry?  Yeah, there was white stuff in the corner of my lips a lot.  Mixed with brown stuff.  It looked like a fluffernutter coming out of your mouth.  Yeah, but when I smiled, it was stuck to the side of my mouth.  And she peeled it off and made me smell.  It was very sour.  Sounds wonderful.  Yeah.  It smelled like the stuff between your toes. 
[02:08:00]  Sis, sis.  Sis, sis.  Sis, sis.  So, yeah.  He's working on 28 projects.  28 projects?  We'll be calling in a few minutes here.  Who could do that?  And they're all ranging, too.  He's doing, like, the Bernie Madoff movie, and then he's also doing Not Another, Not Another  Movie.  All right, wait a minute.  There's going to be a Not Another, Not Another Movie.  That's what it says.  Which is a spoof, I would gather, on these spoof movies.  Yes.  So, does that just turn it completely around and negate the fact that it's a goof movie 
[02:08:30]  and just make it the regular movie?  I loved Not Another Movie.  Not Another which movie?  I don't know now.  I'm a little confused.  How many have they had?  A lot.  Not Another T-Movie.  Burt Reynolds.  Burt Reynolds.  Not Another T-Movie was good.  That was, like, the first one.  I liked that one a lot.  But then they started going crazy with him.  Michael Madsen.  Chevy Chase and Burt Reynolds.  Watch out.  Wait, wait.  Burt Reynolds is playing C.J.  Waters?  That's what it says. 
[02:09:00]  Was he a C.J.  Waters in another movie?  Let's find out.  I, um...  Because you can click on it.  No.  No.  Okay.  It sounds like one of his character's kind of names that he would have had.  You ever see The Longest Yard?  The new version?  Uh, the new version?  Yeah.  All right.  What a pile of horseshit that was.  That is an Oscar winner compared to what I had on my television whilst lying in bed,  again, too lazy to get the remote. 
[02:09:30]  It could be, could very well be, one of the worst movies ever made.  Whoa.  All right.  Now, can we get a hint?  I'm going to take that bet.  Wow.  Because I saw a really bad movie this weekend, and I got tricked because the trailer looked  really good.  Okay, and this can't be the same movie?  No.  Because this is a movie that was out a while ago.  Let's have a bet.  I think my movie is worse than the movie you saw.  Wow.  How do we decide?  What genre is yours? 
[02:10:00]  Well, I had a bunch of people over this weekend up from Philly, so we decided to kind of chill  and put on a movie, and then we're thinking festive, so let's do Christmas movie.  And then, of course, people like Elf, you know, Home Alone was one of the suggestions.  Was it a comedy, though?  Bad Santa.  Did you end up with a comedy?  Yes.  Okay.  Oh, I know it.  Mine also, an alleged comedy.  So good.  At least we're on equal footing.  Mine was a Christmas theme.  Christmas-themed, mine was not Christmas-themed.  Christmas-themed comedy.  That's okay, though, because we're on equal footing. 
[02:10:30]  It's kind of hard to pit a drama against a comedy.  I think I know what Ope got.  And that damn on-demand said, trailer, preview, whatever.  I previewed and went, holy shit, this could be really good.  Maybe people just never saw this movie.  Christmas with the crunks?  No.  No.  I bet I know what it was.  That would have been an Oscar winner.  You know?  I bet I know what your movie was.  How are we going to do this?  I hate when we're all sitting in this, like, fucking competition mode.  No.  No.  And no one wants to speak first.  I know what your movie was.  What kind of... 
[02:11:00]  Yours wasn't a Christmas comedy?  What was yours about it?  How old is yours?  Let me...  And how are we going to decide which movie was what?  I'll make the decision.  I'm a movie expert.  I'm going to say what the year is here.  Don't, um...  Although me and my brother-in-law...  My brother-in-law and I.  No.  Me and my brother-in-law.  Always.  Always.  Laughed our asses off at times, and then there was a lot of down time.  A lot of down time.  So it had its moments, if you could sit through the down time. 
[02:11:30]  By the way, no one would ever guess my movie.  I bet I...  A Christmas comedy.  My movie came from the year 2008.  Whoa.  I think mine came from 2008.  2008.  I don't know, though.  This actor, on the heels of very successful comedies.  Is he typically a comedic actor?  Is it a movie we'll know?  Yes, it's a movie we'll know.  You won't know mine. 
[02:12:00]  It...  The ice skating movie with Will Ferrell.  No.  No.  Oh, good God.  I didn't see that one.  Is it a Will Ferrell movie?  No.  This is a movie that I can honestly say...  A Steve Carell movie?  No.  Evan Almighty 2.  No, no, no.  A Jim Carrey movie?  No, no, no.  What about your movie?  A Christmas comedy.  Mm-hmm.  Um, and it was...  Is it one of the worst movies you've ever seen? 
[02:12:30]  No.  Okay, because this, to me...  Most people would say it was a piece of shit, but like I said, there were times this movie  was hilarious, but then...  It's a low-budget movie, mine.  And mine isn't a surprise.  Like, I think everyone knew this was a giant hunk of shit.  Mine no one will know, but then maybe they'll know after we talk about this.  Yeah?  Can I guess who starred in yours?  Yes.  Is it Vince Vaughn?  No.  Oh, I thought it was Fred Close.  Uh, Anthony?  Yes, sir.  Vince Vaughn?  No. 
[02:13:00]  Darn.  Nope.  Language.  My movie...  Um...  Jingle All the Way?  No.  That's a good movie.  No.  That was a terrific movie.  I don't think I ever saw the whole...  It's good.  Jingle All the Way movie.  Uh...  How do we do this?  I hate this.  A comedic actor...  Uh-huh.  ...who, um...  Also had a franchise.  Dan Aykroyd. 
[02:13:30]  Nope.  2008.  2008.  Oh, 2008.  Um...  It was a big movie.  Was it successful at the box office?  It was an utter bomb.  Oh, my goodness.  And it sucked so bad that I couldn't imagine that this guy would destroy his franchise legacy  to put this out.  I got it.  The Zohan?  I got it.  What is it?  I got it. 
[02:14:00]  Do ya?  Michael Myers.  The Love Guru.  The Love Guru.  I got yours.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  Don't.  It was so bad.  Why do you think he was on our show?  I know.  That was the only reason we got Mike Myers on our show.  He doesn't come in when he's promoting a good movie.  I...  We always get the A-listers when they're promoting horseshit.  A bomb.  There wasn't even a chuckle to be had.  Like, there was nothing funny, entertaining, interesting. 
[02:14:30]  No redeeming value whatsoever in this fucking lump of shite.  But there were characters.  Oh, plenty of characters.  And it might as well have been...  Wasn't Justin Timberlake in that?  Yes.  Justin Timberlake was in it.  I didn't even know what was happening.  Like, story-wise, it just was...  It was awful.  And his character was stupid.  And he was trying to fit Austin Powers-ish jokes in with this new character. 
[02:15:00]  It was like, let's take a guru guy who's supposed to be Indian and stuff and just make him the fucking Austin Powers character.  And throw some hockey in there.  And throw, like, hockey in there, which didn't make any sense.  Was it edgy?  Did you watch the whole thing?  No, I actually did get up and just finally got out of bed.  But this was laying in bed.  I watched a large majority of it, though.  I watched a large portion of it.  Enough to know it wasn't going to get better. 
[02:15:30]  It was shit on my screen.  If I would have shit in my hand and then just rubbed it all over my flat screen.  Laid back down in bed, I'd have been more entertained watching my finger-painted shit on my Sony Bravia.  How does he fuck it up so bad when he has characters?  A character-driven movie that he's been very successful with, obviously.  Because he...  This character wasn't funny.  It was just dumb. 
[02:16:00]  He was an American raised in India.  Why do you want to join the Tugging My Poodle Ashram?  So girls will like me.  Then I will like myself.  Who has learned the ways of love.  If you follow my method, you'll get your wife back.  From Paramount Pictures and Squadlize Entertainment, you can doubt his methods.  Guru, please, what is your plan?  All right!  You can't help me! 
[02:16:30]  Oh!  I'm going to admit to something.  Still out.  Okay.  But you can't argue with his results.  Damn!  Damn!  Damn!  Looks like he's smuggling a schnauzer.  Mike Myers.  I'd like to thank the Academy.  Wow!  These things are heavy.  Yeah.  Pull me down, jackass!  Okay.  I want a hip joke.  Love gurus.  I want a hip joke. 
[02:17:00]  All right!  June 20th.  That's his carpet.  Vroom!  Vroom!  All the sound effects of the trailer.  See, it's edgy.  Vroom!  Vroom!  Usually when we play a trailer, we fill in the blanks visually for everybody, but that's  so bad, I didn't even feel like doing it.  And we just all had butthead faces on, is what it was.  Fuck!  It was so bad.  Wow.  So that was probably amongst the top, I'll put it in, the top five awful movies that I've 
[02:17:30]  seen of all my life.  Wow.  Did you, you didn't laugh at all?  Not even a chuckle here or there?  Not even close to laughing.  Actually, the movie made me angry.  Oh, that's not good.  The comedy made me angry.  Look at these dopes.  15% positive reviews from the reviewers.  And then 39% of the audience actually liked it.  Did you see Love Guru fucking kicked ass?  It's so funny.  Mike Myers is great.  It was... 
[02:18:00]  You win, by the way, because we were howling a few times during my movie called Cooper's  Christmas.  Exactly.  Ew.  No one heard of this.  What is it?  Dave Foley's in it.  Dave Foley.  Okay.  Good old Dave Foley.  Could you get the, uh, maybe the, uh, trailer?  It was really hard to find on Rotten Tomatoes, but it was on demand.  This Christmas.  It wasn't even that.  It's, it's kind of...  During the Halley Jet.  It's kind of low budget, kind of, uh, Danny McBride-ish before Danny McBride became a huge 
[02:18:30]  star.  All right.  Here's the trailer.  Huh?  Oh, wicked.  A video camera.  Look how small it is, too.  And we're going to take the best Christmas ever, right?  With me giving out presents to Marcus.  One up to mommy.  I think it's time you'll learn the truth about Santa.  He don't always bring you what you want.  He can't afford it.  It's Christmas 1985.  85. 
[02:19:00]  And we're playing back to 25 years later.  Christmas is here, children will cheer, children will cheer, children will cheer, sir.  Happy, happy.  Hey, what?  I'm getting pretty big, aren't I?  Ew.  Smoke.  Someone popped a baby boner for his cousin.  Hey, I love that.  I'm in the movies.  Oh, hello.  Hello.  See, that kind of looks funny.  It looks funny, right?  Here we go.  You want to throw us off?  What?  Slud riding.  I hate this song. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, Mary, Mary.  No, there's no idea what's going on.  Oh, my God.  That's just pandemonium being recorded.  Looks okay.  Who the hell is going to watch this?  Language.  Yeah, you don't want to piss up God on his baby boy's birthday.  All right.  That didn't look that bad.  You can see how it would have potential. 
[02:20:00]  There's some funny lines in there, right?  Yeah, so what was the problem?  And the little niece comes to the door for the big Christmas Day festivities, and she's  now like 17, and she's blossoming.  She's hot.  And the father, or her uncle, I guess it would be, zooms right in on the boobs.  Yeah, yeah.  And then the little kid got a boner.  Yeah.  There was a lot of downtime in between those funny lines.  In between the funny scenes that we just saw in the trailer?  It was one of those?  Yeah, you just saw the best part of the movie in the trailer.  Yeah, I hate when they do that.  Unfortunately.  I usually, when I go to an on-demand movie, and I'm not sure about it, and I hit play 
[02:20:30]  trailer, I will play the trailer just long enough to go like, all right, this looks interesting,  and then stop the trailer.  Oh, really?  I never watch an entire trailer if the movie starts looking.  The second it starts looking interesting in the trailer, I turn the trailer off and  start watching the movie.  That is fucking brilliant.  Because I don't want to wreck the fucking movie.  Because all of us are like, oh, the trailer, we've got to watch the whole trailer.  And then you ruin the movie for yourself.  Sometimes I can't shut it off fast enough.  I'm like, I cover my eyes, and I'm hitting the button, and I'm going, la, la, la, la. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  Because I don't want to know it.  At least you don't handle it like an ass.  I'm glad you handle it like an adult.  Of course I do.  This isn't a good...  First of all, it was called Cooper's Camera originally.  Oh.  But on demand, it's called Cooper's Christmas.  It was filmed in 2008, and there's no score yet, meaning no one has gone out of their  way in the last two years to review this movie.  To review it at all.  At all.  Oh, right.  Who starred in it?  A lot of kind of nobody. 
[02:21:30]  It is kind of nobody, as ish ish.  Dave Foley was in it for a little bit.  Jason Jones, Dylan Everett.  The lead guy kind of looks familiar.  The father.  They all look kind of familiar.  Kind of familiar.  Fucking internet stinks in this place.  You've got to get hardwired.  You were supposed to get a fucking Cat 5 out of this router right into your fucking computer.  I got one for mine.  It's lovely.  I never lose connection.  Hey, Cash is from Brooklyn.  Sucks.  He wants to know your other four movies. 
[02:22:00]  Oh, as far as horrible ones?  I'd have to think about it.  I was just saying, like, that has to be in the top five.  I can't even remember.  I know.  I couldn't even put a list together anymore.  I can't even put a list together anymore.  I will put a list together, and I will tweet it.  And it's got to be movies that you actually saw.  That I saw, yeah.  You were stuck in a movie theater or something.  There might be worse movies.  I can't even remember, because you forget about it as quickly as possible.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I can't even name one.  I mean, obviously, I can name Caddyshack 2.  Caddyshack 2 is one of the worst movies ever made. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, agreed.  It's embarrassingly bad.  And I did see that whole movie.  So there you go.  There's one.  No, you can't do things like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Killer Clowns from Out of Space.  No, they're supposed to be.  They're like, they're supposed to be campy and fucked up.  These are movies that they put out thinking they were going to be good, and they sucked fucking balls.  There's nothing better than the movie that's so bad it's funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Example of that, well, it wasn't a bad movie, but I saw it as a comedy.  Was that about Schmidt?  We talk about that one.  About Schmidt.  Yeah, it was good.  That movie Bill. 
[02:23:00]  Bill is one of my favorites of all time.  And it's not supposed to be a comedy.  It's not supposed to be funny.  But it sure is funny.  It's hysterical.  I didn't see Battlefield Earth.  I knew that would be horseshit.  Battlefield Earth wasn't even bad to the point of one of the top five worst movies.  It's a bad movie, but it's an I don't care movie.  Not like it didn't make me angry.  I have to be made angry for the movies to get off there.  It's like, I'm so pissed this is a movie.  Yeah, I can't even remember.  Yeah, I'll figure it out.  I'll think about it.  Should we take a break so we're ready for Michael Madsen? 
[02:23:30]  I don't know when he's calling.  He was supposed to call already.  I thought it was 9.30 on a sheet.  Oh, 9.30?  It says 9 a.m. phone-er.  9 a.m. phone-er.  Jimmy, Jimmy, any other fucking little tidbits you want to throw into the show?  I thought it was 9.  But I thought...  We have Putin singing Blueberry Hill.  Yeah, what's with Putin?  I don't know.  What is this one about there, Sam?  Is it a new song there?  Vladimir.  He should be Putin to sing.  We're on hold. 
[02:24:00]  Michael Madsen's not picking up.  Shit, he's dead.  Oh, no.  I don't think he's dead.  Are we reporting it here first?  Yes.  He's not picking up.  Not a good sign.  He died.  He's not dead.  Michael Madsen was raped to death.  That we know of.  That Metrodome snow pouring out is just an awesome video.  What a great video.  What's the Putin thing about?  It was some event.  I don't know exactly what the event was, but it was tons of celebrities and political people  in the audience.  He got up on stage and he did a little number. 
[02:24:30]  And of course you would be dead, Anthony, with the snow.  You see that?  The more I look at that.  It looks all puffy.  If you were standing below that, you would be dead.  It's all puffy.  And is that people on the field when it happened?  It looked like there was a couple of people.  Here and there, just kind of checking things out?  I don't know.  I don't know.  A lot of the shit, like speakers and stuff, are falling down.  Yeah.  That's a good one.  So he was just at some appearance and decided to sing Blueberry Hill?  It was like a cancer event.  He was trying to raise money.  For cancer? 
[02:25:00]  The treatment of.  Oh, sorry.  I found my fill.  Oh, God.  Fucking Russian.  On Blueberry Hill.  Yeah.  Filly Hills.  On Blueberry Hill.  When I found you.  The moon stood still.  Still.  On Blueberry Hill. 
[02:25:30]  Right now, a Russian stripper gets up and, give me the moon, yeah.  They're all coarse.  My dreams came true.  Do we have to play the whole thing?  I found my thrill.  Three heel.  On Blueberry Hill.  That guy stinks.  Does it get better?  You're allowed to play as much as you want, but you didn't play the whole Paul McCartney song,  so you could at least play the whole.  I gave him a taste of that.  He did play the whole Paul McCartney.  Oh, scrambled eggs, we heard.  We did scrambled eggs.  Thank God we heard that whole thing. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah, why don't we hold on?  You know what really stinks over there in Russia?  God, even the music is just...  It's not even like the oldie Blueberry Hill from here.  Why don't they...  The Montreal...  Why don't they throw a little color into their communism?  Yeah.  I know they're not as bad at the commie thing, but why no colors if you're a communist nation?  Well, they're not commie anymore, but... 
[02:26:30]  I understand, but...  They act like they still are.  But so when you see these nations that are kind of like keeping their people down, they  never use color.  Why?  Yeah, have some fun.  Have some fun with your...  Gussie things up.  Oh, God.  Benjamin Buttons?  That's not top five worst movies of all time. 
[02:27:00]  No, no.  Should have been better than it was.  That wouldn't be top five.  No way.  Can I point out how stupid we are wondering if that would actually kill people?  The weight of it caved in the roof of the Metrodome, and we're wondering...  I said it would kill people.  He said it would look fluffy.  It looks fluffy.  How much snow can you take on your head before it fucking breaks something?  It's probably giant chunks of ice is what the problem is.  We think it's like fine powder.  It's shushing skiing powder.  Yeah, we're thinking it's like being in a snow globe. 
[02:27:30]  Yeah, all nice.  All nice and stuff.  Semi-Pro?  Semi-Pro was bad.  But not top five worst movies of all time.  Not top five worst movies.  Bad Boy Bubby ruled, Scott and Jersey.  The first half hour to 40 minutes of that movie ruled.  Yeah, the first part of it made up for...  Can we get the Bad Boy Bubby trailer?  It's been a while.  You want to see a twisted fucking film.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Yeah, that was fucked up. 
[02:28:00]  Where's our copies of Bad Boy Bubby?  I used to show that to people.  I got mine on my system now.  This is an Australian film.  It was just so fucking out there.  Here's the trailer.  Bad Boy Bubby.  Wake Forest is using Toyota software.  This is an advertisement.  Are they?  Jesus.  Doesn't sound like Bad Boy Bubby, though.  No.  Sounds like a commercial for some type of automobile or something.  How many seconds before our video starts?  Five.  Sweet, Alice.  I want to time it perfectly.  I don't want...  All right, here we go. 
[02:28:30]  That's pretty hard to fucking do.  At first, he did seem to spend a lot of time alone.  Yeah.  Mom looked after him.  Washed him naked.  I don't see...  Although sometimes she called him the Bad Boy Bubby.  It's like Neil Diamond.  What the hell?  And there was always Cat to play with.  Then one day...  Hey, son.  You can call me Bob.  What came back? 
[02:29:00]  And everything changed.  All right, don't go making a big thing of it.  Bad Boy Bubby went on a voyage of discovery.  I just like when his mother fucking...  Yeah, was washing him naked.  Washes him naked and she blows him or some shit.  I don't know what's going on.  They're having sex.  They make him have sex.  It's just so fucked up.  She's like old school communist mom.  Yeah, that is really fucking a twisted thing.  Yeah.  And then it just really goes bizarre. 
[02:29:30]  I don't know what's happening.  Though we were part of you, part of me still.  For you were my thrill.  Oh, Blueberryville.  Come, cleanse me, baby.  We'll see what we shall see.  I'll bring where it goes with me. 
[02:30:00]  I'll give it you where it goes with me.  Doodly, doodly, dee-doo.  Each of them doodly, doodly.  What part did he sing?  This is how behind the time they are there.  They're singing this dribble.  This is how behind the time they'll be in the wheel of play. 
[02:30:30]  Hey, people have noticed I've gotten better at my toodly, dee-doo horn.  Yes, thank you.  But all of the slams we made were never to be.  I love the fact that not only is he Russian, but he was like, at one point, I guess, the premier of the country. 
[02:31:00]  And they're singing to raise money for cancer, and we're like, he don't sound like the record.  Yeah, he sucked.  He don't sound like the record at all.  They picked a creepy song.  He found my thrill and blue belly heel.  Worst movie ever. 
[02:31:30]  Can we get a list from the internet?  Yeah, but theirs probably aren't even, like, the worst.  Theirs are probably the worst, like, artistically and shit like that.  What about Rotten Tomatoes might have, worst of the worst?  Horrid.  The worst of the 2000s.  Witless Protection.  Didn't see it.  Why?  I saw that.  Oh, the 2000s are over?  Redline.  Didn't see it.  This is your list for the worst movies of the 2000s.  Three Strikes.  Didn't see it.  Three Strikes.  Didn't see it.  That's the problem with these.  No one saw these movies.  No one saw these movies. 
[02:32:00]  Super Babies.  Baby Geniuses 2.  That's got to be really fucking bad.  Didn't see that.  National Lampoons.  Gold Diggers.  Didn't see that.  No, I didn't see it.  Worst movies of the 2000s.  We're up to number four.  King's Ransom.  King's Ransom.  Nope.  No, I didn't see that.  Three.  Pinocchio.  Didn't see that.  You're lying.  Runner-up was One Missed Call.  Didn't see it.  Worst movie of the 2000s.  Ballistic.  X versus Seaver.  Sever.  That's the one it was.  Sever.  Yeah. 
[02:32:30]  That movie wasn't a good movie.  I did see it.  It wasn't good, but it wasn't, like, the worst movie I've ever seen.  They're saying worst movie of the 2000s.  It was bad, but, you know, there was shooting and action in it.  What was it called?  Ballistic.  Now let's do best movies of the 2000s while we're at it.  Yay.  You saw one out of the ten.  Yeah.  And you see a lot of stuff.  I see a lot of on-demand shit.  You see a lot of movies.  I want to see...  I'm on-demand.  I'm on the on-demand key. 
[02:33:00]  I bet you best movies of the 2000s, we've seen at least seven of them.  Let me see.  Best movies of the 2000s?  We got a list?  Thank you.  Checking it twice?  Yeah, let's do this.  This is because Michael Madsen decided not to call our fucking show today.  He's in L.A. probably sleeping.  He's probably being cute.  I don't blame him.  I bet he's probably bummed that the Jets fucking collapsed.  You think he...  How many clicks are you going to do?  What are you doing?  Yeah, do-do-do-do.  By the way, when we come back, I think we should have Rob bring our tickets so we can see where we're sitting. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, that's a good idea, goddammit.  I want to know.  Make sure men of similar ilk have good tickets.  Watch, they give us like single, two single tickets sitting on opposite ends of the fucking place.  That'd suck, right?  You know how fast you'd get fired for Heckley McCartney?  Oh my god.  We'd just run up on the stage and fucking stage dive.  Get a picture with him.  Do a scramble day.  Start yelling into the mic and singing.  All right.  Yesterday!  She loves to...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!  Fucking security tackles you. 
[02:34:00]  You'd be so fired.  The seating chart was a very complicated thing to figure out.  I would imagine.  It took, like, all last week.  Yeah.  Oh, to find out who's sitting where?  Make sure that everybody's sitting in the right spot.  You know what?  Mr. McCartney has his interests.  I best not be shunned.  I best not be in the Lincoln seats up there, Pop.  I think you're going to be in the Lincoln seats.  I don't.  I think we're all going to be in the Lincoln seats.  Oh, God.  Top movies of the 2000s.  We'll only do the top 10, but some movies that should be mentioned that didn't make the top 10. 
[02:34:30]  Avatar.  The Hurt Locker didn't make the top 10 of the 2000s.  Crazy.  Precious did in Slumdog Millionaire did not.  All right.  So let's do the top 10.  Pan's Labyrinth was pretty sick.  Top 10 movies of the 2000s.  Lord of the Rings.  The Fellowship of the Rings.  Never saw it.  Oh, the Lord of the Rings movies.  Rule.  I like the Lord of the Rings movies.  Then you got The Brokeback Mountain.  Not one of the best movies. 
[02:35:00]  Fruit movie.  No.  Pain.  Come on, spit in the hand and fucking fuck him in the ass.  It was great.  Not one of the best movies.  Pain's Labyrinth.  Number eight.  Didn't say it.  That was pretty sick.  I saw that.  Number seven, No Country for Old Men.  I love that movie.  Yeah, I think so.  Mystic River was the stunk.  Number six movie of the 2000s.  It was not good.  No, it wasn't good.  Number five, The Departed.  Not that good.  Not that good.  Someone likes fucking Boston.  Number four, The Pianist.  I liked The Pianist with Adrian Brody.  Yeah, it was good.  Right up until the end when the poor Nazis were captured. 
[02:35:30]  Number three was Crouching Tiger.  Get out of here.  I try to sit down.  Stop with your fucking acrobatic Chinaman.  I try to sit through that horse shit a bunch of times.  Never made it.  And what else?  What do we got?  Girl moans to a city of God.  Didn't see it.  That was great.  Didn't see it.  Fucking great.  About Brazil?  Didn't see it.  You're going to like the number one movie, though, Jimmy.  There's fucking connection.  Lord of the Rings.  The Return of the King.  Return of the King. 
[02:36:00]  Return of the King was good.  You should move Hurt Locker up that list.  Two Towers.  They didn't like Two Towers that much.  A lot of these people.  They like Fellowship and King.  Where do Two Towers end up?  Oh, that's number 20.  There it is right there.  Yeah.  Hmm.  All right.  It's our movie break, everybody.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Hey, boys.  Hey, oh, did you say About Schmidt is so bad that it's funny? 
[02:36:30]  Well, it was hilarious.  I know it's hilarious, but I'm confused by that movie because I'm not really sure it was supposed to be funny.  Because when I saw it, I was the only one laughing in the theater and I was howling and people were getting mad at me because I was laughing at parts, I guess, that were supposed to be really sad.  And then I'm thinking they did this on purpose and it's actually supposed to be funny.  I don't know.  I don't know what the answer is.  Oh, God.  Like when he goes home and his wife is dead with the one shoe off and the vacuum cleaner's still on?  I howled.  Yeah, it's funny.  I was pissing my pants.  Every time I watched that movie, I pissed my pants because it's freaking hilarious. 
[02:37:00]  That letter that he writes to that kid?  Right.  Oh, my God.  That shit's a riot.  What about when he tries to take a look at his old childhood home and it's a tire store and he's trying to figure out where his bed was in the tire store?  Now, was that supposed to be funny?  Was that supposed to make you really sad for this character?  Oh, it's like a pathetic.  I think the only thing it's sad is those dopes who watch that movie and think it's supposed to be sentimental.  That shit is a fire.  Sentimental.  Right.  Because, I mean, at every turn, his life was getting worse and worse, which I found really funny. 
[02:37:30]  And he's just walking around with that stupid look on his face.  Right.  Yeah, that's a riot.  I really don't know because it was when we were off the air, so I went and saw a lot of movies and I saw a lot of movies with old people because that's...  That's where your friends were.  Exactly.  I played golf with old guys and I went to the movies and saw a lot of old ladies.  That was my thing.  That's the wrong crap for that movie.  That movie's a fucking riot.  Wait, and Hurt Locker is shit.  I don't know, man.  I love Hurt Locker. 
[02:38:00]  That wasn't good.  It was well acted, dude.  It was good.  I like Hurt Locker a lot.  All right.  Hey, I'm in the Army, guys.  Now, that's why you didn't like it.  I understand.  A lot of military guys did not like that movie.  Yeah, because it's not accurate, they say.  Blah, blah, blah.  But for us civilians, that movie was really great.  It's a great story.  It's a great story.  But they did it wrong because they tried to make the real shit way too real for how ridiculous  crazy that story was.  Don't worry about it. 
[02:38:30]  It's a great story.  Don't worry about it so much.  It's like the new action adventure guy I created.  Turk?  No.  Oh.  A new one?  Yes.  What happened to Turk February?  This is even a better one.  Bill Tetley.  He's my new action hero.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Bill Tetley.  Like the T?  Yes.  And?  That's it.  That's it.  Okay.  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:39:00]  Serious X-Hine.  Hey, that's all right, man.  No, I know.  Turk February is Jimmy's action character.  Yes, and he's now got a song.  That's like the opening theme song, almost like James Bond-y.  It's got a little James Bond thing happening.  I didn't even realize that was Danny?  Yeah.  I guess that karaoke's suiting him well.  Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.  His hammy delivery of Turk February's theme song is great.  We said this earlier.  Ant said it. 
[02:39:30]  I said it.  Breaking news.  Roof collapse forces game to be moved to Detroit.  Excuse me.  Yeah.  They're lining up already for their free tickets.  Free tickets.  They're lining up about 10 hours early to get their free tickets to see the game tonight.  Well, they knew that nobody would want to go see the Vikings game in Detroit.  Vikings Giants.  Vikings Giants in Detroit.  It's like, who gives a shit?  So they decided to give away the tickets. 
[02:40:00]  What a dumb idea.  So I can't wait for the riot footage.  There's nothing wrong with giving away free tickets.  I love that idea.  Yeah.  But you can't have people line up for free tickets.  That's where the problem is.  You think there's a problem there?  Yes.  How should they do it?  Think the who.  Well, as everyone pushes forward for their free tickets.  Well, wait a minute.  Now they give the tickets out first.  That's better than just opening the doors and saying.  They're lining up.  What they should do is, if you're there already, give you a fucking ticket and say,  that beat it, stupid. 
[02:40:30]  And now Liam come back.  But then again, these people probably are there early because they want to be real close to the field.  They got a fucking problem on their hands, man.  I can't wait to see it.  I'm telling you, they got a fucking problem on their hands.  The awfulness that comes from this.  They got a problem.  This will not end well.  Hey, you see the UFC?  I did not, no.  I was very busy Saturday.  Good shit.  Well, did St. Pierre win?  I didn't.  I didn't see it.  Shit.  Damn it.  The one good thing, though, is that I'm satisfied with my Paul McCartney ticket seats. 
[02:41:00]  Yes, yes, yes.  Very good seats.  Why are you guys wearing a suit?  I'm not wearing a suit.  You've got to wear a suit.  Why would you wear a suit?  Because it's a big, it's not like you're going to fucking Molly Hatchet at the Long Island Arena.  Are they playing?  Yeah, I had to stop and, uh.  Are you really, you're really wearing a suit?  Yeah.  Or at least a jacket.  I'm not wearing a jacket.  I'm wearing an Armani suit. 
[02:41:30]  I don't have the whole suit.  I have the entire suit.  Because my tattoo that says suits are for fags would look really silly.  Ah.  Yeah.  You guys are really wearing suits or are you setting me up?  No, I'm wearing a suit.  I'm not wearing a suit.  I got a suit right in my suit.  No suit.  Look, I have a suitcase here.  It's a case for suit.  It's all folded.  It's in the name.  It's right in the name.  It's all folded now.  No, but it's in that little thing, that zipper thing, that then folds into three little things  and goes into the upper part of the, it's fantastic.  I got to say, everyone says, Anthony, what kind of luggage do you use?  And I use 5.11, tactical luggage. 
[02:42:00]  Where do you put the gun?  This is, uh.  Where's the compartment for the gun?  Oh, there's plenty of room.  Right up here.  Right there would be one.  Sure.  Right up there.  Yeah, of course.  Uh, it's got all the webbing here for hanging various hand grenades and other things you might  need during travel.  Nice.  What about the wheels?  The name tag to, uh, give the name to the next of kin if you're, uh, shot or anything.  And, uh, the expander.  I see the expander.  It's a wonderful, uh, and fits, by the way, perfectly the maximum allowable space for carry-on. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, but I bet you they always tell you that's too big and then you have to explain it to  them.  I'll tell them.  They know?  Fuck off.  That's what I say at the airport.  If anyone hassles me, I go, fuck off.  I'm getting on the plane.  And then they go, we're sorry.  And they let me through.  Damn, see, that's the thing, you talk tough and people respond.  Oh, of course.  Or maybe they're giving away the tickets and now those people that showed up 10 hours early  got really nice seats and they could now go home.  Like, how is this working?  Does anyone know?  We can't watch TV right now. 
[02:43:00]  We can just kind of look over and, and, and check out the headline real fast.  I'm certain they know.  Uh, yeah.  Our seats are pretty good for tonight.  Oh.  I'm very happy.  Let's see.  The Apollo Theater.  Paul McCartney.  What the hell is this?  Come on.  Celebrating 20 million subscribers.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  We, uh, let's go to Brian in Jersey.  Brian.  Oh, guys.  Uh, I saw Paul McCartney a couple of years ago in Atlantic City.  I mean, the music was just like listening to the CDs.  It was cool. 
[02:43:30]  Um, the crowd was so not into it and he, he's a weird guy.  He, he had like one bizarre story after another that had nothing to do with music and it just  like ruined it in a way.  How does it ruin it?  You're watching a Beatle.  I don't know, man.  He could shit on the stage.  I'll be entertained.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a fucking Beatle.  If he, actually, if he doesn't, I won't be.  We're not, believe it or not, none of us were, you know, we're old enough that we  actually saw the Beatles.  This is like, this is cool.  Yeah.  You didn't see the Beatles live? 
[02:44:00]  No way.  What's wrong with you?  Yeah.  I didn't see the Beatles live.  Of course not.  So I'm on TV.  He could tell whatever fucking dumb story he wants.  I don't know.  It was weird.  It was like about a massage he got.  I mean, it was beyond weird.  It was, it was, it was, he's going to play yesterday.  Shut up.  She wouldn't put a finger in my bottom.  I was getting a massage.  She wouldn't put it in my asshole.  I'd rather see Jimmy Norton any day of the week.  Well, you can see me at the Borgata Late Show, January 15th, bub.  Tickets on sale at Brewer, Atel, me, and Burr. 
[02:44:30]  All right.  And it was the last show we're doing there.  I love you guys.  Thank you, Burr.  All right.  Let me, let me, let me say hi to Matt in Minnesota.  Matt.  Hey, guys.  What they're going to do with those tickets is anybody that has a ticket for the game yesterday  that's supposed to be at the Metrodome is going to get a ticket.  And then anybody that went to the Detroit game yesterday with their ticket stub can get a ticket  or get in with that.  And then all the people that are lining up now have to actually get a ticket.  And when I saw the news this morning, they were, they had probably 1,000 or 2,000 people 
[02:45:00]  stand in front of the stadium waiting for tickets.  Wow.  There's going to be some problems tonight.  Oh, yeah.  How many Vikings fans are making the trek?  They said that they've got a shuttle or a shuttle plane going up there, two or three charter  planes going.  And they said people are driving in from New York to get free tickets.  So.  How many hours from Minnesota to Detroit?  I have no idea.  14, maybe.  12.  Oh, my. 
[02:45:30]  I missed the show earlier.  Did you guys watch the video yet of the stadium collapsing?  No.  What the fuck?  Really?  Yeah.  You know what?  I, the news has been like holding back that or something because they haven't shown it  once since we've been sitting here.  You fucking idiot.  If you go to any of the, uh, the Minneapolis news stations, I got video on it.  Just change the subject.  So.  Oh, really?  So I'll go to the, uh, Minneapolis news stations and they have it?  Is the story national?  Because, uh, you'd think it would be all over the country. 
[02:46:00]  Yeah, for some reason we don't know.  And even in New York, since the Giants are supposed to play there, you would think we'd  seen it a thousand times.  They're showing it right now as we yell at you.  You're the kind of guy that's tweets me fucking shit I saw 10 weeks ago.  That's the kind of guy you are.  Oh.  A bum.  I'm sorry.  I was so nasty to you.  I hung up on this guy, but he needed to call back because he thinks he's just terrific.  Go ahead, uh, Chisel.  Hey, uh, morning, boys.  Hi, Chisel, my nizzle. 
[02:46:30]  Remember, I hung up on it.  Hey, uh, Jimmy, I got my tickets for, uh, Saturday, so, uh, coming out for the weekend.  Thanks, buddy.  Ooh.  Looking forward to it.  Uh, I heard that they were handing out American tourist luggage to all the, uh, free tickets,  uh, people waiting in line.  What do you mean?  Why?  For what?  They're not, they're actually going to the movie.  They're not going anywhere.  I mean, to the, uh, game.  Um, well, I mean, you know, just so they can, like, you know, handle the luggage a little  bit.  Um, the fucking people that work there, they know that there's a big crowd coming. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, we're kind of confused, sir.  Yeah, they, I mean, they're expecting a big crowd.  He hung up.  Uh, he knew.  We heard you.  Got it.  It's fuck over the listeners.  Caller's day.  Hung up on him twice, but he said, nope, my line is too good.  I got to keep calling until he, he picks up the phone.  And no, it isn't Samsonite.  It, it is American Tourister.  That's a misconception.  Yes.  I would have said Samsonite, I think.  Yeah. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  I don't know why it got turned into Samsonite over the years, but it was American Tourister  that was being, um, tossed around by that mammal in the, uh, cage in the commercials.  Let me go to Mongo.  Mongo.  Mongo.  Uh, you got something to add, or is it the same thing that other guy said about the tickets,  uh, for the game tonight?  Pretty much the same thing.  But anybody that has a ticket gets preferred seating on the 50-yard line, so that ought  to cause some, some stuff.  The, uh, I read the, uh, roof of the, the Metronome was brought down by the weight of 
[02:48:00]  Brett Favre's enormous ego.  And I bombed.  Nah, your phone, your phone, your phone crapped out.  I wouldn't actually say you bombed.  What happened?  What'd you say, dude?  Yeah, right.  I would say.  This guy hasn't missed a minute.  You think you can get him with that?  Uh, no, we almost had him.  Oh, uh, let's go to Anton in, uh, Sacto, uh, C-A or something.  Anton.  Anton.  Anton.  The great Danton. 
[02:48:30]  Anton.  Anton who?  His friends or something?  Anton.  It's Anton and Anton.  Oh, right.  We know.  You can't just go with this.  Go ahead.  You.  Boom.  Yeah, I just want to let you know they were showing the dome collapsing here in Sacramento  on the 6 o'clock, 6 a.m. news.  This isn't happening, is it?  You're not real, right?  Are you a hallucination we're having?  Oh.  It was this morning, so I was surprised you guys didn't see anything or haven't seen anything 
[02:49:00]  out there in the east coast.  What roof collapsed, though, dude?  I heard something, but no one will tell us which one.  Yeah, they haven't shown it yet.  How does it look?  Because we haven't seen the video yet.  They have that dome that's like parachute material, and they were showing it bubble down,  and then they just show it.  This isn't real.  It's going onto the field, and that's about all I got.  Did the whole thing just fall down at once?  Holy shit, the whole thing fell down?  I didn't know that.  That's what I heard.  What happened to it?  Yeah.  It was like bubble down, it calmed down, and then there was a big tarot. 
[02:49:30]  Wait, no!  We saw it!  It was like a thousand times!  Holy shit, you stupid!  We just said it, too.  All right, thanks, Anthony.  Thanks for nothing.  I thought he was goofing, and then he's like, yeah, it's like a parachute material.  Are there really people out there that don't realize when something that big happens that  it's shown on every newscast in the country?  I don't know.  There are people that don't understand that.  It's stunning to me. 
[02:50:00]  Come on.  I'm literally stunned.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  So are you wearing a suit or not?  Yes.  Hell fucking no.  Why not?  No fucking suit for Paul McCartney.  Why not?  It's not for Paul McCartney.  It's the suit, like, you're going out to, like, a theater.  We're going to the fucking Apollo.  Yeah, but it's not like for a fucking amateur night or nothing.  I'm not wearing a suit.  Do you think a lot of people will be well-dressed?  Probably. 
[02:50:30]  Fuck them.  I don't care.  Yeah, but it's not like you don't care.  You just have a nice Armani suit you want to wear.  I understand.  I have some other nice ones.  Maybe if I had an Armani suit, maybe I would fucking wear it.  Or Joseph Abood.  I have a jacket.  I'm not breaking out my wedding suit to go to a Paul McCartney show.  You have the wedding suit?  Oh, my God.  People are on to me, too.  They're like, fuck, how about you get maybe more than one suit?  Troy wants to go to see him tonight.  I'm going with my girlfriend.  If I wasn't going with my chick, like, if she had to, she might be doing something tonight 
[02:51:00]  for work.  If she was working, I would take Troy, but I think she's going with me.  Yeah, I would take Troy, too, if I have anyone to go with.  Troy ain't going to.  No, she won't.  He will.  He would do that.  He would anyway.  He would give you a blowjob.  He would give you guys blowjobs.  He would give all three of you blowjobs if one of you would take him.  And I don't want radio answers.  I'm sick of people going, yeah, because they want to save for the radio because it's shocking.  Troy.  I think he's dressed nicely just in case he gets to go.  Don't give me a fucking radio answer.  I hate that more than anything. 
[02:51:30]  It's like a slob.  Give it to him in two and two.  Let's just say Jimmy's got a Paul McCartney ticket for the Apollo tonight.  Would you blow him because it's for the Paul McCartney tickets?  Don't fucking say yes just because we're doing radio now.  I probably wouldn't blow, Jim.  Boo!  Would you touch it?  But maybe a handy.  I'm trying to get tickets to the guy.  It's impossible. 
[02:52:00]  Why won't they give you tickets?  Isn't there someone around here that could give up their tickets?  Who am I?  You know what I mean?  I like the attitude.  That's good.  That's true.  That's a nice self-confidence you got there.  Well, I mean, you know, I'm not you guys.  You guys are going to take care of you guys.  Thank God.  What's the matter?  You don't get treated like shit?  Oh, come on.  Don't be fresh.  Hopefully something works out.  I don't know.  We'll see.  If my chick wasn't going with me, I'd take you, but she is.  That's cool.  There was a lottery for employees that Troy was counting on, but he didn't win that lottery. 
[02:52:30]  No.  No, he didn't.  Who won the lottery?  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Someone that isn't going.  Funny you should ask.  They take his tickets back?  They did not do that.  They did not do that.  It got worse and worse.  Who's ticket?  They did not do that.  Jimmy.  He actually, can you believe that?  Oh, you can't give them away, huh? 
[02:53:00]  So where are those going?  So who got those tickets?  From my understanding, they went back into the pool.  By the way, the people out there.  Then they're going to get all wet and ruined.  But then how do you get back in the pool, then?  Yeah.  Back in the pool.  Yeah.  Who then?  Oof.  My joke bomb.  Yes, it did.  No way.  Are they going to get wet?  All wet.  Like that joke.  Except it's not wet with laughs.  It is the Apollo.  Can I get a lime green suit?  Oh, you should do that.  It's racial.  Velour.  That would be funny.  You wore like a felt hat with a big feather. 
[02:53:30]  Who is this bitch?  How do you get back in the pool?  You know how I dressed for my Jets game yesterday?  That's how I dressed for Paul McCartney.  No difference in my world.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just feel like...  Why are you dressing up?  What's wrong with you?  I feel like being...  It's night out.  Night on a town.  What would you wear to Paul McCartney, Troy?  I don't know if I'd wear a suit.  I don't know if it's a suit event.  No, you can wear a suit.  Troy's wearing a sweater.  I would wear a nice shirt or something.  I'm just wearing a jacket.  Because my fucking fat stomach is so offensive. 
[02:54:00]  And I hate it so much that a shirt will just show it off.  It's all I'll think of.  Where's Keith Richards pinned like that?  I want to look like I belong there.  Okay, so steal a suit.  So where are those tickets?  Someone else got them?  If they went back in the pool...  I doubt that they'd go to me.  That's pretty funny.  I'm going to get wet from the pool water or something. 
[02:54:30]  Did they draw another...  Why would they draw?  The tickets would be no good if they drew them.  Because that would be like they were stolen.  Yeah, I'm not quite sure.  I just looked into it to see what happened and they said that...  Yeah, if there were two tickets that no longer could be used...  Yeah.  Then who got those two tickets?  Next of kin?  Can't they just give you one?  Next of kin.  Give them a ticket.  I believe HR was the...  They were taking care of...  Who was...  Puffinsta?  Get out.  Who was giving the tickets away.  Get out.  They shouldn't have any responsibility for... 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, why is HR giving out the tickets?  They were the ones that were doing the lottery pool.  It is a big inner...  I mean, a lot of people who work for the company would want tickets.  Of course.  So...  I thought HR was for the skirt chasers.  They handled this type of thing, too?  They handled the lottery.  For the ass pinchers.  Yeah, the ass pinchers.  The butt slappers.  Yeah.  The hey, honey, nice...  Wait, Human Resources does more than that?  I always thought that's all they did.  But they had to handle a lot of legal stuff, and this would definitely...  Yeah, like the skirt chasers.  To make sure it's fair. 
[02:55:30]  To make sure it's fair, yeah.  Am I right or wrong?  You are correct.  The pull-down-the-panties-and-jump-on-the-copier people.  Okay.  I understand what you're doing.  They deal with those people.  The Christmas party sexual assault all boozed up.  Right.  Okay.  I'm starting to understand.  Still not quite sure, though.  I really didn't know.  They did other things.  The hey, secretary, you want to take some oral dictation for me?  That's right.  You know that, and then they make a joke about it.  Hey, honey.  I'm a little sucking dick.  And then there's hobnobbing going on.  Yeah, yeah.  Hobnobbing.  Yeah, yeah.  Dictation. 
[02:56:00]  Right, right.  That's right.  I didn't know they did lotteries.  Fuck.  They got the lotto.  Can we get some numbers?  Well, they have a lotto tickets.  Oh, wow.  That was good.  I didn't think you could top the pool, but wow.  That was a good one.  Yeah.  Well, they're going to ask the Tommy Lee's house in the pool than my joke.  Troy is shit out of luck, people.  How do you like that, Troy?  I still haven't heard back from my chick, but I have a thing she is going tonight.  Who else is going that, like, who's the closest people to this show besides us that are going? 
[02:56:30]  Probably the janitors and other scum.  Is it?  I doubt it.  The one person we're not talking about.  Right.  Eventually we will.  Who was lucky enough to win.  Don't worry about that.  And then couldn't go.  Yeah, he's not going.  And who else?  No.  Well, a lot of the executives are going.  So, E-Rock?  Since when is E-Rock an executive?  In his mind.  Exactly.  The word executive isn't anywhere near E-Rock.  It's the executive.  God forbid I make E-Rock feel good for once and you have to fucking knock him down to earth.  I didn't want him to think he was getting a promotion. 
[02:57:00]  Steve Blatter.  I would assume he will be there.  Gary?  Gary's there now, I think.  Is Gary going?  Gary, probably, yes.  All right.  What's his new name, Egghead?  I call him Mr. Show and Winner.  I don't know what you guys are.  Oh, my.  I just call him Gah.  Oh, okay.  Gah, Gah.  I would imagine Scott Greenstein, of course.  Sure, yes.  Yes, of course.  Andrew Moss, who's the, I believe, CFO, will be going.  Will Howard Stern be going?  Oh, yes.  And various. 
[02:57:30]  Will lovely Robin Quiver.  Yes, various members of the Howard Stern Show are going.  Ah, support staff or just the key players?  It is my understanding that there are.  Will Ira be going to see Paul McConaughey?  I don't think Ira is going.  At the Apollo Theater under clear skin?  I don't think Ira is going.  No, Ira?  But we owe it to Bobo to try to get him a ticket.  Oh, sure we do.  Dude, they protect Ira around here like he's a mob guy going on trial.  We can't get close to the fucking guy anymore.  I haven't seen him. 
[02:58:00]  He's on the fucking show protection program.  I'm not even joking.  You walk by that studio and you see him in there, but then all of a sudden they get him  in and out of here without having any type of contact with us.  Jay Thomas?  Jay Thomas going?  That is not confirmed.  I don't know.  Uncle.  Cousin.  Uncle.  Cousin Brucie.  Cousin Brucie.  I would assume that Cousin Brucie has the option of going.  Cousin Brucie.  He's got a relationship.  Who probably knows Paul McCartney.  Oh, yes.  He met all Beatles many times.  Scott Mewni.  I don't know where Scott Mewni is going.  His skeleton. 
[02:58:30]  Yes.  Will Earl be bringing his skeleton to the show for a reunion?  I don't think Earl gets to go.  Clickety-clacking Scott's skeleton up on stage.  Although I wouldn't be surprised if Eric managed to nagel his way into some tickets and hasn't  told anybody about it.  Would you be surprised?  Not at all.  I would so not be surprised.  I wouldn't be surprised if he's got tickets.  Nagel.  Are you going?  Are you going?  No, I do not have tickets.  Wait, are you going?  Does your wife have tickets or friends have tickets?  Anyone you know besides us? 
[02:59:00]  No.  So you are 100% not going tonight?  That is correct.  Okay.  Do you want to buy tickets?  Sure.  Let's scalp them.  Let's scalp them out front.  Tickets.  Tickets.  Is that tempting to see the tickets right there?  Yeah, I was looking at them.  I was scoping them out.  Said clown.  Just grab them.  Orchestra tickets, dude.  You wouldn't even be able to see them on the floor there, right there.  Yeah, we're not close enough.  Ooh, there's your good seats.  Sorry.  We checked them out.  They are right on the floor.  They're great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Cool.  Well, have fun, guys.  Yeah, we're orchestra seats.  Orchestra seats are like, you know, good seats.  I just got some good news for Troy.  What?  The concert is being broadcast live. 
[02:59:30]  You can listen at home on Sirius XM.  That's right.  That is right.  Excellent.  Cool.  Band on the Run Radio.  Uh-huh.  You don't rate.  So now, what are we going to get?  Are we going to get some Beatles?  Are we going to get some wings?  I would assume.  Are we getting some solo material?  Are we getting everything up until that stupid ukulele song?  I was going to say that would be what he would start with.  If he opens with that ukulele song, I'm walking out.  That's the closer. 
[03:00:00]  I'm walking out.  Everybody going to dance tonight?  Everybody going to dance tonight?  No, we're not.  Atta boy, Sam.  I heard he's ending with that starting with yesterday.  The second I hear this, here's what comes out of my mouth.  I got to go take a piss.  Watch my seat.  Do you like this song, Troy?  This album was okay.  This song isn't that good.  But the album that he did after this one with his band called The Fireman is excellent.  It's probably his greatest work since the Beatles, in my opinion.  You know something?  I have no clue what the guy has done lately.  I'm just going to the show. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He was going to the Beatles.  Wait, wait, wait.  Let's go with the Troy thing for a second.  Whatever, Troy.  I don't know what he's been up to.  But I'm going.  My goal is to meet McCartney.  And I have a couple of calls in.  I probably won't be able to pull it off.  Did you bring him some books?  Your tool?  Yeah, they're his.  They are true.  Bring him Aussie books, you idiots.  That's all I want to do is tell him that he should do a duet with Aussie.  Oh.  Because all I want to suggest to him is I would love you to do a duet with Aussie.  Why are you pimping for Aussie? 
[03:01:00]  Because it would make Aussie happy.  Would it?  No.  I want to go to this concert now.  It's a good song.  Right, Troy?  No.  I mean, it's not bad.  It is bad.  McCartney really doesn't have bad songs.  But The Fireman, that album is incredible.  It really is a good record.  So I'd recommend it.  The Fireman.  Yeah.  He'll probably do Sing the Changes tonight.  Sing the Changes?  Do we have that in the system?  That's good.  Was that done on Apple Records back in 68? 
[03:01:30]  No.  Then we don't want to hear it.  The Fireman was actually the last record that he put out.  And he did it with this guy named Youth.  I forget what band he was in.  All you need to do is play your old songs.  All you need to do is play your old songs.  Yesterday, you wrote the songs we wanted to hear.  Nothing from today after 1970.  Do you think they deserve to see this concert, Troy?  It's painful.  It's painful.  I don't care. 
[03:02:00]  Band on the Run came out after the set.  Here it is.  Do you want to see this?  Miss Wings?  Love, love the old songs.  Yeah.  I hope he plays the old songs.  Yeah.  I just want to hear his old songs.  So please play your old songs.  If he does the concert chronologically, will you guys go home early?  Oh, fuck yeah. 
[03:02:30]  I'm out of there.  Fuck yeah.  I'm out of there in 1976.  40 minutes.  Yeah.  Oh, wait.  That's right.  Hand me your tickets.  I'll jump in for this.  40 seats in the house.  That's it.  You'll make it to 76, you think?  Oh, please.  I don't know how much time he does.  I heard 52 minutes.  Someone's walking out the door.  It's Anthony because I'm playing new songs.  Someone's walking out the door.  Because my new album, it smells.  It's just rhymed.  Yeah, of course.  He may do like three hours.  Yeah? 
[03:03:00]  I mean, I hear a lot of things, though.  Yeah, I know.  Who told you that?  I don't remember.  I don't think there's an opening act.  They want me to do a few minutes.  Really love you.  Wow.  It's so cool.  Jimmy's doing a few minutes tonight.  Yeah, it'd probably be funny.  Yeah.  I'd love to do a few minutes.  You'd definitely get to meet him.  Yeah.  Not after my time.  Before the set.  Before.  Here I go.  Because here I go.  Again.  Again.  Da, da, da, da.  Everybody.  I want to hear Old Sons. 
[03:03:30]  One of the new shit.  What?  Where are Seinfelds going?  You think?  Probably hook him up with a ticket, but definitely faster than they get Troy.  I would take Jerry.  I'd leave my girlfriend home.  She would be in her dress and be like, look, Jerry wants to go.  And he would sit there and then the whole time be like, could I just watch this?  Could you not talk to me?  I'm not going to ask anybody Seinfeld questions.  I don't know anybody on that show.  Would you blow off your girlfriend for Troy?  I would rather go with, not that I don't love my girlfriend, but she's not a huge fan. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, that makes it worse for Troy.  I'd actually rather go with Troy.  But I have to go with that.  I'm available.  Troy can explain all the songs for you and everything.  Yeah.  But if I need a picture taken, though, Troy wouldn't want to take it.  He wouldn't want to be in it.  So that's why my girlfriend has to come out.  That's true.  Troy is selfish like that.  If I need a photo.  If you got me into the concert, I would take the picture.  And if your girlfriend screws the picture up, you could punch her, too.  Right.  You can't really punch Troy.  What are we allowed to bring in?  Are we allowed to bring in our HD flips?  Yeah, you could bring in video equipment. 
[03:04:30]  Oh, really?  Do you know how fucking taboo...  Awesome.  I'm going to set up a four-camera shoot.  Yeah, you're going to be able to take a picture in that fucking place?  Anything you want to do.  Really?  No photography.  I bet you can.  Of any kind.  You think they're going to say no camera?  No.  No.  Sometimes.  Because when I saw Paul before, I mean, everybody was taking pictures.  Yeah, where?  My dad brought in a big camera to take pictures with it.  Yeah, we can bring in a camera.  They're not as strict with cameras anymore because every fucking phone has it. 
[03:05:00]  It's a no-win.  They used to start...  Maybe you couldn't bring cameras into concerts.  Now everybody has a fucking video camera.  They don't care anymore.  HD flip?  It's like they've given up on the fucking fight.  All right, I'll see.  I'll wonder about that.  Because Paul actually had wanted to get tickets to see me and Jim Brewer and Dave Attell and Bill Burr at the Borgata Lake Show.  But I said, tickets are selling fast, fucko.  Too bad.  Fucko.  I said that whole part. 
[03:05:30]  Not to Paul McCartney.  To my dad.  Troy, are you excited?  You might get to hear this song live tonight.  He won't do this one.  I mean, on the radio.  Troy, you might be in if I can't find a babysitter.  Just give me a call, man.  I'm ready to go.  Can I go?  I'm available.  Yeah, Sam, meet you.  Yes!  Why would you go Sam?  Yeah, dude, you don't even give a shit.  Yeah, but...  He doesn't even care.  Yeah, but some of the Beatles songs...  Sam, name one Paul McCartney song.  Yellow Submarine?  Nice.  Good job.  I just got the response from my girlfriend. 
[03:06:00]  I said, do you still want to go tonight?  And she wrote, yes.  Sorry.  Sorry, buddy.  I would have taken you if she didn't want to go, but...  Yes.  Sorry, Tom, you're out.  Yeah.  Yeah, yesterday.  That's another.  I love that one.  That's a good one.  So I'm looking forward to this.  But that wasn't...  I mean, Paul wrote the song, but that wasn't...  He didn't sing Yellow Submarine.  No.  No.  It's a Ringo song.  Could you name 20 Paul McCartney songs in 30 seconds?  Okay.  Ready?  Go.  Hold on, hold on.  Go.  Yes. 
[03:06:30]  And go.  Band on the Run.  Uh-oh.  You stink.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Not too late.  My love.  We're going to give you one more shot.  You panicked.  You named one in two hours.  All right.  Here we go.  Two.  One.  Go.  Band on the Run.  My love.  Uncle Albert.  Sing the Changes.  Dance Tonight.  Let Me Roll It.  Mrs. Vanderbilt. 
[03:07:00]  Who's that?  Why wouldn't you do Beatles?  Oh, you want me to do Beatles?  Oh.  All right.  Start off.  Oh, my God.  I thought you were just doing anything Paul wrote or sang.  This is the last shot at it, okay?  This is very important.  Can you do 20 songs in 30 seconds?  And they could be the Beatles?  Here we go.  And go.  Yesterday, here, there, and everywhere, Yellow Submarine.  Lovely Rita, Sgt. Pepper, Little Help From My Friends, Birthday, Back In The USSR, 
[03:07:30]  Martha, My Dear, Let It Be, Get Back, I'm just, oh, my God, the fucking question.  She came in through the bathroom window.  Silly love song.  Three hours, eight minutes.  How many did I give you?  How many songs did you get?  Watch your ticket go in my pocket.  That's it.  There was a chance for a ticket for you. 
[03:08:00]  I think I got about 12.  All right.  Not even close.  Not even close.  Yeah.  Obviously not a big fan.  I got Yellow Submarine.  Obviously not a big fan.  Everybody gonna be young.  I was trying to give you the songs that Paul actually wrote, and he sang.  Oh, well, that was your mistake.  Yeah, exactly.  Didn't work out too well.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  I can't wait.  I can't not take my girl.  I gotta take her, but I wish Troy could go with me.  Babysitters are tough to get.  I'm going with Opie.  That's right.  Oh, shit. 
[03:08:30]  It's gonna be fun.  Yeah, we didn't even ask about that.  Are you taking your young lady?  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Unless we can't find a babysitter.  Did you get a sitter?  I don't know.  You should try earlier.  Can I say I'm gonna sit for you?  Yeah.  Troy, can you babysit?  Oh, God.  Oh, dude.  Can you babysit?  Because I got a great show.  You know, I'm going to the Paul McCartney show tonight.  How would you like to babysit?  Huh?  What?  If you go, so help me God.  You don't deserve to be there.  You shouldn't be there.  I'm a serious XM employee.  Troy, you work for the show, right?  Yeah.  You have to babysit. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  So I can go.  It's only fair.  Jesus, that is fair.  I got XMs throughout the house.  That's horrible.  If I got to go to the concert, it would just be to celebrate the 20 million subscribers.  Whoever's on the stage doesn't make a difference to me.  Doesn't really matter.  Who cares?  Maybe Jay-Z will come out with it.  That would be amazing.  Wouldn't that be something?  Jay-Z!  A little Wayne.  That would be huge.  That would make me want to go.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Bad.  Do I have something to do over there?  Yes.  One more.  I might as well just talk.  Because I just talk about this. 
[03:09:30]  It's not even like, it's not anything that I just like talking about things heating up this  holiday season.  You know?  Why don't I have a little, I'd like a little background.
