<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show opened with a whirlwind of topics.  The hosts heavily speculated about the upcoming in-studio appearance of Lisa Kennedy Montgomery, a former MTV VJ, promoting her book "The Kennedy Chronicles," focusing on her alleged sexual relationships with celebrities like Michael Jordan and Bill Murray.  A caller even claimed to have slept with Kennedy at an MTV party.  This transitioned into a sexually explicit recap of a newly released audiotape of Monica Lewinsky and Bill Clinton, followed by a similarly explicit discussion of Simon Cowell's affair, with considerable commentary on the involved woman's appearance.  The discussion then turned to the controversy surrounding Philadelphia Eagles player Riley Cooper's use of a racial slur, debating the sincerity of his apology and the media's reaction.  The show concluded its first major segment with a lengthy, humorous recounting of their infamous Boston Mayor Menino death hoax and the subsequent fallout, including playing audio of the news report and their own apology.  The segment was filled with crude jokes and sexual innuendo.

The next segment featured Lisa Kennedy Montgomery as the main guest.  She shared anecdotes from her time at MTV, including a story about Ben Stiller paying for her dinner after she publicly called out his attempt to avoid an after-party. She also discussed editing challenges for her book, particularly clashes with her copy editor over the use of words like "autistic" and "retarded."  Montgomery then recounted numerous humorous and sexually explicit stories from her MTV days, including details about encounters with various celebrities, a dice game with Michael Jordan with a sexually suggestive prize, and bringing "Puck" from *The Real World* home for Christmas, resulting in a disastrous family holiday. She denied rumors of a sexual encounter with Michael Jordan but admitted to a near-sexual encounter with Johnny Rzeznik that inspired a Goo Goo Dolls song.  She also discussed her post-MTV career, including radio work, television appearances, and even her experiences with bees and a cobra cage cleaner.

The interview with Kennedy continued, with her recounting negative experiences with Tom Yorke (Radiohead), describing him as a "jerk" and detailing an incident where he dramatically sank in a pool.  She shared stories about Courtney Love's behavior, including a phone call where Love eavesdropped on Kennedy criticizing her, followed by Love's press release claiming Trent Reznor had a small penis.  Kennedy also detailed dating various musicians, including Dave Navarro (Jane's Addiction), and offered critiques of other musicians' kissing skills.  The conversation touched upon the rise and fall of 90s bands and the personalities of musicians like Kurt Cobain.  Dennis Falcone, a colleague of the hosts, then joined, offering commentary and a humorous anecdote connecting Kennedy's sister to his workplace.  The conversation devolved into a discussion of "dick songs," filled with song titles and suggestive lyrics.  There were brief discussions about Anthony Weiner's sexting scandal and Dennis Rodman's appearance, before concluding with a viewing and discussion of a vintage Rolling Stones performance.

A significant portion of the show featured a studio visit from Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris, the actors who played Marie and Hank Schrader in *Breaking Bad*. The conversation centered on *Breaking Bad*, its final season, and their experiences filming the show, including anecdotes about emotional scenes and on-set interactions. Brandt brought bubble wrap, which became a running gag.  The hosts and guests frequently used profanity and sexually suggestive humor. Norris discussed his past Hollywood experiences, including roles in *Total Recall*, and they touched upon the impact of social media on actors.  The interview concluded with promotional mentions of their future projects. A brief segment at the end discussed the show's scheduling and a missed text message.

Later, comedian Nick DiPaolo called in to promote his shows, complaining about the Helium Comedy Club's press arrangements.  The conversation shifted to Sam Roberts' desire to improve his professional image by wearing suits, prompting jokes about his colleagues' reactions.  The discussion included numerous references to clothing brands and styles.  The segment concluded with a conversation about concert experiences, comparing the intensity of seeing artists like Jay-Z, Bruce Springsteen, and Billy Joel live, contrasting their own concert-going styles, and including a caller's anecdote about their relatives viewing Jay-Z as a devil worshipper.

Finally, the show ended with Opie and Anthony discussing their favorite live music performances, specifically highlighting Alice in Chains' and Jay-Z's "Unplugged" performances. They then announced the end of the show, promoting their Facebook page and air times before transitioning to the Ron and Fez show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So fleshly.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it sounded cool.  Like rotten eggs and syrup.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed.  And conventions burn to the ground.  Would you like to make some fucking dick?  Whoa!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  He's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony.  The Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Fired of these people.  Up my ass all the time, trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton. 
[00:01:30]  Lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yep. 
[00:02:00]  There we are.  Good morning.  Dab-a-doo.  Scoodle-dee-boo.  Hi, everybody.  Ah.  Fresh cup of coffee.  Fresh cup of Joe.  Well, we got the Kennedy coming in today. 
[00:02:30]  The Kennedy Chronicles.  What's, uh...  What's the resurgence all about?  Uh, what do you mean?  Well, she kind of disappeared, you know.  She disappeared for a very long time.  Yeah.  What did she do after MTV?  We're talking about Kennedy from MTV.  Yes.  Yeah.  She's got a book out called, uh, the Kennedy Chronicles.  And she was kind of poking her head, uh, up against the glass yesterday during the Dana White interview.  And usually we would just say, yeah, come on in and say hi. 
[00:03:00]  But we were backed up with guests, so we had to say, well, hi, but we don't have time right now.  So she's coming in today, which is cool.  Now we got some time.  Yes, we do.  Yeah.  Yeah, because, uh, it's kind of odd that all of a sudden, you know.  Did she sleep with Michael Jordan?  That's what they say.  That's what they say, right?  Yeah.  You think Michael Jordan has a big piece?  I would hope so.  He's got it.  You think he's got a big one?  He's got it.  It's Michael B. Jordan from The Wire and Fruitvale Station.  Oh.  Oh. 
[00:03:30]  So Kennedy's coming in.  That'll be cool.  Well, considering MTV started today, 32 years ago.  Dr. Kennedy.  Oh, really?  32 years ago.  32 years ago today.  Do you know what their first...  Yes.  Everyone in the world knows now.  All right.  What about the second one?  What was the second one?  Because we did that break, too.  Oh, man.  But see, coming in second just sucks.  It cares.  Because no one fucking remembers that.  What the fuck?  No one.  You know, the day they broke the four-minute mile, Mr. Bannister there. 
[00:04:00]  You know there was another guy that broke the four-minute mile the same day?  Same day?  Only second.  Only second.  No one gives a fuck.  Yeah.  I have no idea what that guy's name is, but I do know that happened.  What?  It's Pat Benatar.  She didn't make the four-minute mile.  Pat Benatar ran a four-minute mile.  Wow.  That's incredible.  Wow.  That's pretty...  In high heels and everything?  Amazing.  Nice.  With that sensible haircut of her, she ran a four-minute mile.  Very sensible. 
[00:04:30]  She must have been in and out of the shower through the 80s.  Yeah, I think so.  Right in, right out.  Maybe a little moose.  Yeah.  When moose was popular.  A little moose.  What do they call it now?  Because they don't call it moose.  Oh, it's all kinds of hair products.  So many hair products.  Oh, my goodness.  Who we...  Was it?  Who we are young?  Heartache to heartache.  Do, do, do.  Do.  Oh, this one?  That was it.  What you go?  What you go?  This is the second video. 
[00:05:00]  You sure this was the second video?  That's what the lists online are showing.  Oh.  Oh.  Wonderful.  Nice way to pawn that one off, B-Rock.  32 years ago today, the spaceship went up, right?  Uh, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Yeah.  It's kind of cool that MTV, like, you know, launched a rocket just to start their whole fucking company.  Quite amazing.  She was a rocker chick. 
[00:05:30]  She's still rocking?  I don't think so.  You don't think she's rocking anymore?  I don't think she's rocking.  She's married and has kids and shares some of the aunt's political ideologies.  Whoa.  Nice, Pat.  Really?  No, not Pat Benatar.  Kennedy, I mean.  Ah, I know you're Pat Benatar now.  Or the guy that did the four-minute mile.  Which one are we talking about?  Kennedy did the four-minute mile.  Which guy?  Kennedy? 
[00:06:00]  Kennedy?  Yes.  Around the four-minute mile.  Oh, okay.  32 years ago today.  She's a libertarian.  She's a registered Republican.  All right.  So that means she's a libertarian.  She can be a registered libertarian, can't you?  No, but it sounds like she's a libertarian, but she happened to register a Republican.  Check the wrong box?  Well, no.  Well, you could be a libertarian, but, you know, you kind of want to be on a team that's got  a kind of a chance to win.  Yeah.  You know, so your ideology can be libertarian.  You want a Kennedy story? 
[00:06:30]  Dr. Kennedy?  Yes.  She hates Dallas.  Here's Frank in Brooklyn.  Good morning, Frank.  It's Frank in Brooklyn.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, and very hello to Happy Birthday to Jimmy.  Hello.  Just to give you a heads up, I was a kid working at MTV many years ago, and they had a holiday  party at the time on the top of the NBC studios.  I think it was called the Supper, some sort of Supper Club.  But I was doing some snaps with her, and I had her in the bathroom, and I banged her 
[00:07:00]  in the bathroom.  What?  I don't believe that.  I sent her over, we were doing snaps, because I had it, she didn't, she wanted some.  I took her in the bathroom next to you, and she's sucking my hog.  It was so fantastic.  And I'll tell you, I'm probably not in the book, because I'm uncircumcised, and she didn't  really like it.  She's filthy, though.  She's filthy.  I'm not really going to...  Put that down on the prep sheet. 
[00:07:30]  How can you believe this?  Well, she's coming in, so I guess I'll field that one.  Or, yeah, or call back, Frank.  She'll be here at 7 o'clock.  How is she going to be here?  Because I want to talk to her.  I just told you, 7 o'clock.  7 o'clock, Frank.  7 o'clock.  God, 7 o'clock.  Very funny.  Very funny.  You think she got a lot of...  All right, Jesus.  Oh, my God.  Too early for this shit.  Fucking guy.  Enough of him.  You think she got a lot of dick?  She probably did if she wanted it.  If she wanted dick, she was in a position to get a lot of dick. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Two boys, one cup is one of her chapters.  She's kind of naked on the cover of her book, huh?  Yeah.  She's a little naked.  Yeah.  It's a side shot.  It's odd.  Women from the side naked?  You totally get away with that.  Yeah.  But I can see her ass.  It looks pretty good, right?  That's all right.  She's on a mule.  A mule.  Mm-hmm.  And then out of nowhere, she just comes and says, 
[00:08:30]  Eh, I'm going to write a book about shit that happened fucking...  In the 90s.  30 years ago.  And here is this...  An irresistible story of sex, drugs, and rock and roll  that helps explain why the 90s were so goddamn great.  Wow.  That's Nick Gillespie.  Well, I'm...  The cover of the Kennedy Chronicles.  Is this a no-holds-barred interview?  Huh?  Is this going to be a no-holds-barred interview?  Because, uh...  It was supposed to just be a hi yesterday, and now it's an interview.  Hi, how's your book?  How's your book? 
[00:09:00]  What have you gotten there?  Did you have sex with Jordan?  Great.  Nice seeing you.  Good luck to you.  Yeah.  Did she have cancer or no?  It says, meet...  One of her chapters is, meet the VJs and say hello to cancer.  Or is that maybe it's about an artist?  Oh, my God.  Really?  Oh, God.  I hope it's not...  I think I want to skim over that part.  Yeah.  I want to hear about the sexploits of Kennedy.  That's right.  I wonder if she fucked Bill Bellamy.  Bill Bellamy!  Is she?  Whatever happened to Bill Bellamy? 
[00:09:30]  Any white guys?  Did she fuck any white guys?  I think she's married to a white guy.  Is she married now?  But she might have had a type back then, Anthony.  Is that all right with you?  Oh, it's perfectly fine.  Bill Bellamy, maybe.  Michael Jordan, maybe.  There's a picture of her and Bill Murray.  She might have fucked Bill Murray.  She had sex with Bill Murray?  Is that what you're saying, Sam Roberts?  Very possible.  That was the guy that just called him for the bathroom.  Can you tell he was a funny man?  Yeah, we got to get that guy back of the life.  Imagine she just completely admits it.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  She's like, yeah.  Yeah, what the hell?  Second cock.  It was the 90s.  Like, crazy.  What did he have that she didn't have?  Snaps.  What's a snap?  I'm guessing it's a Coke reference or something.  Okay, I never heard it called snaps.  I'm not familiar with that term myself.  Oh, okay, good.  Good.  Snaps.  What?  I thought it was those things that you take it and throw it on the ground and go.  Right, right.  And she wanted to play with them.  Right.  And he was like, all right, I got a few.  Suck my cock.  And she said, all right, then.  Yeah.  I like snaps. 
[00:10:30]  Sure.  Why not?  Suck that cock.  Suck that cock.  Did you see the Bill Clinton story in the paper today yet?  And where is the audio tape?  Is it available yet?  Not yet, no.  A fucking cassette tape, I think, that they thought was long destroyed has surfaced.  And it's basically Monica Lewinsky, you know, trying to set up a little tryst with Bill Clinton.  Yeah.  So she saved it, basically.  Well, she had to, right?  I think they're saying that a cleaner who was hired to come in and just get rid of everything 
[00:11:00]  that had to do with them.  Yeah.  Nice.  Saved it.  Why would you hire a cleaner when you could do the same shit?  Oh, my God.  Here's all my Bill Clinton cassettes.  I better fucking, you know, get rid of these before they kill me for having them.  It's like the wolf.  You got to get rid of that shit.  But when you get rid of that shit on your own?  Let's not start sucking each other's dicks quite yet, gentlemen.  So the cleaning guy or the cleaning person or the cleaning company decided, you know what?  Why don't we just keep one of these things?  And then many years later, it surfaces, right? 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, because there's also, I think there are letters, too.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that they haven't, you know, put out the transcripts of those yet.  This broad wanted Bill to sneak away so they could see a movie together.  Was that it?  And the president of the United States is going to take out the movies?  Right.  And then she talks about how the 60 seconds was terrific, but she was a bit, you know,  unsatisfied.  And it's hoping that they could go a little longer next time.  A minute? 
[00:12:00]  I guess there was a 60-minute session.  Because, you know, he was a second.  But he was all about, you know, fucking, he had to be in and out because he's the president.  Because Yasser Arafat was waiting for him.  Just dumped the load quickly.  Exactly.  Did you hear the food that this classy broad wanted to share with the president?  Yeah.  What?  Boxed dinner.  What?  She wanted a boxed dinner and a movie.  What trash.  She's thinking, maybe we could just sneak away and have a boxed dinner and watch a movie.  See Bill with a baseball cap on, pulled down a little low, sitting in the theater and everybody 
[00:12:30]  going, there's the president.  Right.  At a movie with some fucking little fat girl.  You don't think that would happen?  No.  And why did he bring a boxed dinner?  Yeah, and he's got a boxed dinner with him.  Yeah.  This is so odd.  She's reportedly heard on the tape whining that a previous 60 seconds she spent with the  horny Prez was just not enough, even though you did look handsome.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  60 seconds.  Maybe we could go over and watch a movie together and just have kind of, I don't know, 
[00:13:00]  boxed dinners or something like that.  Boxed dinners.  I'll have a boxed dinner.  And the cassette shows how Lewinsky wouldn't take no for an answer.  You can't refuse me because I'm too cute and adorable and soon I won't be here anymore  to pop over.  Oh, well.  Like he's fucking got no one else.  Like he wouldn't be able to get another fucking chick being, you know, the president.  Probably not. 
[00:13:30]  That's the problem.  That's why he went for the frump.  You think?  Yeah.  He went frump because that was, you know, the best he could do under those circumstances.  Under those circumstances.  She almost looked cute in a couple pictures.  Did you like her little beret?  Oh, God, no.  Where she was wearing a beret and the president stood in front of her and she made that face  like, ah, I suck as cack.  Yeah, she was trying to like, she was trying to make a plan.  I guess it also on the tape.  It says, now the first thing that has to happen is that you need to pre-plan with Betty that 
[00:14:00]  you will leave the office at, I don't know, at 7, 7.30 so that everyone else who hates  me, that caused me lots of trouble, goes home, she reportedly says on the tape, then you  quickly sneak back. 
[00:14:30]  And then in the meantime, I quickly sneak over and then we can have a nice little visit for  you, you know, 15 minutes or half an hour.  Oh, my God.  And it says, the hot to trot Lewinsky proposes, whatever you want.  I'm going to eat your ass.  If you like this idea, just wink at Gorbachev.  I forgot about that.  His little code.  Another time she's persuading Clinton to meet her, seemingly desperate for another go.  She says, I could take my clothes off and start. 
[00:15:00]  I hope to see you later and I hope you will follow my script and do what I want.  Oh, God, so she's running the President of the United States around.  Right.  And that makes her feel, you know, all good and shit.  Rendezvous for 15 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever worked for him.  Rendezvous.  Trying to see what else is in here.  The National Enquirer says it recently obtained a secret copy of the tape.  The copy was serendipitously made by someone hired as a cleaner by people close to Lewinsky, 
[00:15:30]  the tabloid, reported.  Yes.  Oh.  Yes.  So where's the tape?  When do we get to hear it?  Yeah, when do we get to hear this fucking tape?  I don't know.  Nobody's released the actual tape, just transcripts.  Transcripts?  Why, are they scared shitless to put it out there?  Possibly.  We're trying to, like, figure out how they can monetize it.  Fully monetize the tape.  And then, on the front page of the paper today, we learned Simon Cowell is just a piece of shit. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, what a bastard.  Simon Cowell, of course, from, what, American Idol, X Factor, Pop Idol, whatever the fuck his show's called these days.  Mm-hmm.  He, you know, he's a guy that's one of the richest men in the world.  Yeah.  He could have any pussy he wants, pretty much.  And he decided the pussy he wanted was his best friend's.  His friend's wife.  His friend's wife.  Although she seems kind of like a twat who was married to a rich mogul guy in a $6 million east side apartment. 
[00:16:30]  Right.  And she still could not fuck her husband's friend.  Right.  What a shitty woman.  What a shitty world.  Kind of right there.  She's a shitty New York socialite.  Yeah, socialite.  They call her stunning.  I call her shitty.  A shitty New York socialite.  But Simon Cowell said, yeah, fuck, I'll take that.  That's what you get when you marry one of these fucking socialite twats.  They're all worthless.  That's her right there.  She's hot, but they're all worthless.  She's got big hangers.  Yeah, she's hot, but Simon Cowell has so much fucking dough. 
[00:17:00]  Nice knockers.  I love when they're called knockers.  Knockers.  They're called knockers when they're a bit big.  Yeah, yeah, they're big and hanging a little.  A bit heavy.  They're weighty.  Right.  They go from being boobs to knockers.  Look at her sarong.  Any other pictures of this broad?  This shitty person.  Socialite.  Socialite.  Yuck.  Laura Silverman.  Silverman's.  Is that her name? 
[00:17:30]  Yes.  Well, all right.  Yeah, she's aight.  Of course she's aight.  She's aight.  Simon fucking banged.  What does her husband look like?  He's kind of a frump.  Kind of frumpy?  Yeah, he's just aight.  Not quite.  Oh, boy.  The only reason he's with her, because I guess he had the dough, is what I'm assuming.  The dough?  He's a bit of a frump.  Some cash on hand.  And we all knew Simon Cowell was a piece of shit, so there's no secret there.  That's what made for great TV. 
[00:18:00]  Hmm.  Him being a piece of shit.  So, have fun.  So, I guess the husband, who's divorcing the shitty socialite, is not going to go after  Simon Cowell, his friend, in the divorce.  That's him, huh?  Yeah, he's just a little.  Well, that's all about the money.  Yeah, she's a piece of shit.  Sometimes it's all about the money with these bruds.  She got pregnant, eh?  With Simon's jizz, yeah.  Wow.  Yep.  So, she don't need socialite guy anymore. 
[00:18:30]  Nope.  She gets Simon money now.  She won that fucking pussy lottery.  Right.  Why wouldn't a guy in Simon's position, especially doing that, just pull out?  It's fucking mind-blowing.  Wow.  Right?  What goes on in his head?  Ugh.  95 million a year he makes.  This is wonderful.  Oh, it's a...  I feel so fucking good.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's making all this money, and he's with his friend's chick.  And he still just leaves it in.  He fucking just has to jizz inside her. 
[00:19:00]  That's an alpha male thing.  Even when the opester was putting up numbers, I knew that I had to, you know, not leave anything  behind.  Yeah.  It's all about how long you can leave it in before you pull it out, though.  Right.  And I had no fucking money.  He rocks.  He rocks.  He packs his condoms up and puts them in his pocket.  I've heard about that.  Takes it home.  Takes him home with him.  That jizz, that fucking nagel.  Yeah.  It's like royal nagel seed.  It's like royal jelly in the beehive. 
[00:19:30]  It's a golden seed.  Coveted.  You tie that shit up and put it in your front pocket, don't you, Iraq?  Iraq, comment.  Iraq, comment.  Wrap it in some toilet paper.  Take it with you.  Yeah.  You really do that all the time.  I want him squeezing it in like toothpaste.  Oh my God.  You go into the bathroom, find that fucking, find that glowing nagel seed in the bathroom.  A lucky day for some broad that he's a little behind.  Yeah.  Some of the nagel fucking rubber cement into a twat. 
[00:20:00]  Can you imagine a woman that wanted to be impregnated that bad by Iraq that they would trick him into coming to her house for a tryst?  Yes.  Yes.  And pump the used condom.  And then just pump the fucking used condom up her.  That's amazing.  All right.  Well, let me say hi to Joe in Manhattan.  Joe.  It's Mark, actually.  And you guys could eat my cock for letting me on hold for seven minutes and 20 seconds, man. 
[00:20:30]  Come on, man.  What the fuck?  Mark.  Our apologies, Mark.  Oh.  We owed Mark an apology.  Randy in Philly, what's going on, buddy?  What's going on, guys?  This guy has the same shit that that guy has, so I decided to go.  Oh, exactly.  To the backup.  They both want to talk about the same thing, so I'd rather deal with something that's a bit more pleasant.  Right?  What's up, Randy?  What's going on, guys?  I just want to see what you think about the whole Raleigh Cooper incident.  A white guy says the N-word at a country concert, and they want to string him up for it. 
[00:21:00]  Well, it's a sticky situation there, sir.  It's a very tricky situation.  As we all know, white people are not allowed to say that word, but black people certainly are.  And black people can say cracker ass.  There wouldn't be a story right now.  Huh?  I said if Mike, Vic, or anybody else said this, there wouldn't be a story.  Of course.  No, I know.  That's what we just said.  Black guys are allowed to say it.  White people aren't.  That's the world we live in these days.  Who taped them? 
[00:21:30]  Some fan, I think.  Oh.  But you've got to know at this point.  Sure.  People have their fucking phones ready to go at any second, so you've got to be a little  smarter.  But do they officially suspend them?  Find them.  Who find them?  The team.  How?  It must be a clause.  Morals clause.  Morals.  But he's at a concert.  He's doing your personal life.  He's not in front of a real reporter or a real camera guy.  There was fights going on, apparently, at this show. 
[00:22:00]  Right.  What show was it?  I think it was Toby...  Kenny Chesney.  It was Chesney.  Kenny Chesney show.  And there were fights going on, and he's revved up and shit.  And believe me, I'm sure there weren't many black people at the Kenny Chesney show.  So in context, I don't think he meant black people when he was saying that.  He's just like, you know, oh, every nigga up in this joint.  Oh, is he one of those guys?  No.  He kind of sounded very white and very country.  That was an ER, not an A.  Yeah, because I don't think he talks gangster. 
[00:22:30]  But I think he meant, like, you know, I'm going to fucking beat up every nigger in this  joint.  Meaning every person.  You know?  Like, because a lot of...  I think...  Were there black people that fight?  Kenny Chesney show.  No, it was a bunch of fucking country-ass white guys.  Let's watch the video.  It's on Dead Spirits.  It's everywhere today.  Go ahead.  CrossingBroad.com has it, I guess.  They're promoting it.  I will jump that fence and fight every nigger here, bro.  I will jump that fence and fight every nigger here, bro. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, wait.  Did he say I'll jump that fence?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But meaning, you know...  But why is he pissed off?  I don't understand the backstory here.  Apparently this concert had a lot of fights going on.  Okay.  There were a lot of fights going on at this concert.  So I guess somebody was giving him some shit, and he's like, you know, and there was a fenced  off area.  He's like, I'll jump that fence and fight every nigger here. 
[00:23:30]  And somebody's saying that he was going nuts because he wasn't allowed backstage?  Yeah.  So who knows?  He could have been talking about black security.  Maybe.  I don't know.  It sounded to me...  I don't know.  I'm saying I don't know.  What Sam said makes sense.  It sounds to me like it's more about like, yeah, oh, look at all the niggas up in this  joint.  Meaning like all these people.  Right.  You know, that's how black people use it a lot of times.  Like, oh, that place is full of niggas.  Meaning...  You know, I don't know.  I don't know. 
[00:24:00]  I don't know either.  At a country concert from a white guy who's saying it like niggas, that sounds like you  can't get backstage and you're fucking pissed.  I mean, they're always black security guys.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  They probably wouldn't let him...  Because I never see white security guys at their venues.  So it's probably, you know...  But it's amazing that that's news.  I know.  Of course it's news.  It really is amazing.  Of course it's news.  Who is he?  It really is.  Wide receiver for the Eagles, right?  Wow.  Hmm.  Oh, whatever.  But he's out on the apology tour now. 
[00:24:30]  Yes.  Oh, boy.  Molly, congratulations to America.  You caught another guy saying something wrong.  You got him.  You got him.  We got another guy saying something he shouldn't say.  Now, this is a very good point.  Very good point coming in from Scott in Jersey.  Scott in New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  Pretty good, Scott.  All right.  What's funny is the NFL allowed Dante Stallworth back in the NFL after killing someone while  drunk driving.  There's another guy in the Rams, too, they allowed back in the NFL.  And I guarantee if Aaron Hernandez gets off, he'll be allowed back in the NFL without any 
[00:25:00]  problems.  I have this chance that he's going to be blackballed and never play again.  No, he'll play again.  Of course he will.  Yeah, he'll play again.  Then I got blackballed.  Most of the black players won't give too much of a shit.  Didn't Michael Vick accept his apology?  Like, why is he apologizing to Michael Vick?  He wasn't talking to him.  I don't know.  He apologized or something.  Was he pleasant to a dog?  Right.  Of course.  He had to apologize.  Oh, everyone wants a fucking apology because everyone wants a fucking attention.  I don't know if Michael Vick was asking for it. 
[00:25:30]  I think he just stepped up.  Right.  I think someone...  I think he just stepped up front and said, it's cool.  You know, whatever.  I mean, what's the exact quote from Michael Vick?  I don't want to, like, put words in his mouth.  But he...  He said, yeah, it's fine.  I crack.  I want to say that shit.  Oh, here comes Travis.  Oh, Travis is...  Oh, ew.  Look at how he's trotting.  He runs weird.  Yeah, like a fucking...  Oh, what are you doing?  Travis, you run weird.  Travis is prancercizing down the hallway.  What are you prancercizing?  What are you prancercizing?  Prancercizing.  He's not exactly comfortable.  The prancercizing.  Has another video.  A new video?  That looks exactly like the old video. 
[00:26:00]  Of course it does.  Lunatic.  Michael Vick kind of had to step in because his brother was mouthing off on Twitter.  And put out a bounty on his head or something?  Yeah, I heard that part, too.  Holy shit.  What the fuck is wrong with?  Yeah, Michael Vick's brother decides, you know, I'm going to put a bounty on his head.  And Michael Vick's like, will you relax, man?  He had to say, you know, lay off.  Aren't they fucking teammates?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's why Michael Vick's brother has nothing to do with it.  He was just...  Right, that's what I'm saying.  Like, this jerk-off goes on about his brother.  His brother's a teammate?  Right.  Yeah.  You're putting your brother in a weird situation. 
[00:26:30]  Exactly.  Wow, that's fucked.  So...  Yeah, like he said, it's hard to defend him saying that.  He's talking about his brother.  This is the world we live in.  This is the amazing world we live in, where you've got to apologize and walk on eggshells  for little words that people...  Ooh, words.  Ugh.  Well, let's hear all the people out there that complain that you can't say what you want  and you don't want to talk about.  Let's see how many of you actually call to complain to the team that this guy is fucking... 
[00:27:00]  His free speech is being...  You know?  Yeah.  Chuck, do you know anything more about the backstory?  Why this went down?  Of this?  Yeah.  I have no idea.  It just sounds like someone was having a good time at a Kenny Chesney concert.  But he's really pissed off at something.  I think he couldn't get backstage.  I have no idea.  Hmm.  But, uh...  I'm sure he regrets it now.  Oh.  Like if his brother said it's worse.  He put a bounty on a guy.  Where's the news on that?  Nobody's talking about that.  Why would they?  Why would they?  That's way worse than saying a naughty word, I think. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah, like he's publicly endorsing someone to hit him very hard on the field for money.  Oh, I thought it was a murder about him.  No, no, no.  He's out.  And would he be okay with people doing the same thing to his brother?  I know it's old news, you know, but his brother basically strangled dogs to death?  His brother not very loved in the dog community.  You don't understand.  That was the culture.  Yeah.  Right.  It was a culture thing.  You don't understand.  We just don't get the culture.  The culture.  I thought everyone understood that dogs are fucking adorable. 
[00:28:00]  No, there's a culture.  You can't.  Although in the Middle East, they don't like dogs either.  They burn them alive.  Not that one who was chewing on that paralyzed guy's testicles.  What a great story that is.  Poor fuck.  He's not a good dog.  What a poor fuck.  We didn't do that story.  No.  That's a couple days old now, right?  Poor guy.  They had to kill the dog?  Yeah.  Yeah, you can't run around chewing on.  Why?  The paralyzed guy didn't, you know, feel it.  He's good with it. 
[00:28:30]  He probably thought it was okay.  The guy didn't move.  Yeah, he didn't feel the fucking dog.  No, he says he woke up and he's like, and he saw his fluffy dog with blood all over his.  Oh my God.  Oh man, my testicles are all chewed up.  Were they gone or no?  What happened to my balls?  He was apparently just chewing on one.  Yeah, he just was gnawing away.  But was the dog hungry?  He was like a stray that the guy picked up like weeks ago.  He wasn't just having fun.  He was having a ball.  Man.  Oh, we got the apology by Riley Cooper. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, he was talking to the press.  He talked to him for a long time, so there's just a snippet.  Yeah, that was the full side.  Just so we have the whole story out there.  Have you had too much to drink?  I was drinking.  I was drinking, but that is no excuse for what I said.  It certainly is.  Now you're hearing just bullshit. 
[00:29:30]  Now this is bullshit.  Now you're just hearing bullshit.  People use the N-word.  He got caught using the N-word, but now he's going to make believe that that was a slip.  It's all bullshit.  Drinking is an excuse.  It's like, how much poor judgment do you put on your fucking Twitter account when you're drinking?  Things like that.  You just sit there and go like, oh, that probably wasn't the best thing to tweet.  Meh.  What happened?  I was drinking.  You seem to be speaking from experience.  Well, I have experience reading people's tweets that shouldn't have proposed a thing. 
[00:30:00]  But now you're just hearing a lot of bullshit.  He uses the word.  And he got caught using the word.  Of course he does.  And everyone uses the word.  Sure.  And people get caught from time to time.  And then we all look at him like, holy fuck, what a pariah.  What a pariah in our society.  We need to remove him.  It's fucking retarded.  It's all things retarded.  And you put it that way.  Even the people writing the stories about the guy use the word.  Right.  But we all play our roles.  Oh, my God. 
[00:30:30]  He's a pariah.  We got to remove him from Earth immediately.  We have to be outraged.  I can't believe this is happening out there.  People love outrage.  But it's, you know, it's phony outrage.  It's phony.  It's all bullshit.  Yes.  The world we live in is such bullshit these days.  All bullshit.  That fat piece of shit was fucking modeling skirts yesterday.  I'm obsessed with that fucking pig.  Who isn't?  The wiener girl is what I'm saying.  Oh, I thought you meant to rock.  She was hired by a company.  And she's going.  And she's going. 
[00:31:00]  Sorry.  And she's going, people think I weigh 200 pounds.  I weigh 140.  God, you wear it well.  There's no way she weighs 140.  No.  Every woman you know pads their fucking number.  So if she's admitting to 140, she's probably 165.  She wants to be out there.  She's got to take the fucking heat.  She looks horrendous in skirts.  Terrible.  She was modeling leather skirts just because that company knew they would get a little heat. 
[00:31:30]  Did they post the pics?  Yeah.  I want to see some of the pics.  How crazy is it that she tries to out him and then she's just being humiliated because she's a fat pig?  Yeah.  Yeah, she's disgusting, man.  In more ways than one.  She's disgusting to look at and she's just a disgusting person.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's in the other paper.  Does someone have it so we can see the picture?  And then we'll get to the apology.  It's the other paper.  I don't know which one you're looking at.  I don't know.  They're all the same to me.  I guess it would be the post.  It's over there or something. 
[00:32:00]  I do think she's a bit of a delightful girl.  Oh, gosh.  Do you think she's delightful?  She got a retweet from her, you know?  Yeah, she follows me.  Because Jim tweeted her saying she was delightful and now she follows him and he tweeted him that you are hilarious.  I think she followed us with it.  Oh, really?  Get her in here.  We'll have a nice interview with the broad.  We'll be nice.  It's on page 17.  Page 17.  17.  17.  Oh, in our workbooks.  Please turn to page 17.  Page 17. 
[00:32:30]  That's 13.  Is that her online?  The same picture?  No.  15.  I don't think so.  Yeah, that's her.  I don't think so.  I want to make love for you.  Ah!  It's so horrible.  She kicks her little leg out and puts her hands on her hip.  Look at me.  Ah!  Leather skirts are rough for women to pull off in general because they're so stiff they don't really move.  Yeah.  So it almost looks like you're wearing a bell.  A bell?  Oh, she's wearing a bell. 
[00:33:00]  She's horrible.  This is terrible.  I don't like her.  She has a nice little coy smile.  A come hither smile.  Come on.  Look at her.  She's saying come hither.  Have some pride.  That's a come hither.  Have some pride.  You don't like her come hither smile?  No.  Come hither, boys.  She's getting everything she wants.  Yeah.  Is she really?  Sure.  All that attention?  And what's going on with Wiener today?  Nothing.  What dumb fucking statement did he make yesterday?  He was in Rockaway yesterday.  Was he? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  Wiener.  He loves Rockaway.  I'll tell you one thing.  Fuck the Wiener story.  I'm loving the story with the assistant and the fucking intern.  Here?  No.  That is a good story, though.  Wait, you want to do the apology real fast before we move on to the material?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  Because I know we're all over the place.  I want to hear the waddle doodle.  All right, here's the Riley Cooper just completely lying to everybody.  But he has to at this point.  But then we all make believe he's not lying.  It's a terrific thing.  We do.  Have you had too much to drink? 
[00:34:00]  I was drinking.  I was drinking.  But that is no excuse for what I said and what I did.  Absolutely not.  Have you used that term before?  I don't, I don't, I don't use that.  I, uh...  But I guess, what is he supposed to say?  In this environment, you don't go, yeah, I used it before.  I use it all the time.  Then you're out.  So good.  Good for him that he's lying.  That's what we've gotten to the point of.  When you're forced into an apology, you must lie during said apology to try to keep your gig. 
[00:34:30]  We would probably do the exact same thing.  Who is going to say yes to that?  Have you used that in the past?  Right, right.  Oh, yeah, just ten minutes ago.  Right.  That's retarded.  Have you used that term before?  I don't, I don't, I don't use that.  I, uh, like I said, I was raised way better than that.  I'm not a great mom and dad at home.  And they are, uh, they are disgusted with my actions. 
[00:35:00]  And you guys are teammates, specifically your African-American teammates.  What do you say?  I'm not telling exactly what I'm telling you guys.  Would they be asking a black player this if he said something about white people?  These fucking white reporters, these fucking, these liars in the media.  Liars.  Holy shit.  Yeah, would they be?  But every African-American teammate.  Everyone plays their part as a liar, though.  Oh, my, they do?  Yeah, this guy, of course, has used the word before.  Of course he has.  What do you say to your Caucasian teammates about using the term cracker? 
[00:35:30]  Have you said cracker before?  Is there, I mean, this is fucking ridiculous.  It's insanity, and people just fucking can't get enough of it.  And then we wonder why it's happening.  Why can't I say anything I want to say?  Yeah.  Gee, I don't know, because when something like this happens, you just fucking, you don't  say anything about it.  You sit here, and you're watching on the news, and you're, what am I supposed to say?  I don't know.  Call the team and object, dumb motherfucker.  Because people always complain.  We say, we can say what we want.  But they're like, well, we're not in jobs.  I'm laughing. 
[00:36:00]  Why are you pulling up an old Opie and Anthony apology, you asshole?  This is what happened when the news confronted Opie and Anthony about being pranksters and  going a little far.  Well, do you, I'm sincere in my apology, right?  We were so...  That's how you handle an apology.  We were so...  You apologize, but you make sure people know you're not sincere.  We were so not sincere in this apology.  Like, yeah, dude.  Like, laugh on your face. 
[00:36:30]  Like, yeah.  You know when I talk about the Oapster?  This is pretty much the last year or two of the Oapster.  Because it was like an I'm sorry with a whatever bro over it.  It was a whatever bro.  Like, all right, look.  We apologize to the body, but like reading it.  Uh, you know, we are so, uh, we are so distant from those two guys.  Dude, I don't even know who that is.  How are we still doing radio?  Because like, we had the chemistry, obviously, but we're those two guys and now we're these 
[00:37:00]  two guys and it still works.  Because I don't even know that guy from this fucking video.  Dude, look at those two characters.  I would never wear a leather jacket, but I was back then.  Remember when walking out of that elevator, making that turn, walking into, like, I fucking  remember that as if yesterday.  One guy's going, whatever bro, and the other guy's going, I don't want to go back into  attics.  I don't want to go back into attics.  I don't want to go back into attics.  Well, this asshole, uh, this is, uh, this is the lobby, the elevator bank, and AF was 
[00:37:30]  right there.  You can see in the background of this video.  We'll put it up on our Facebook page here.  Is that a rock hole behind him?  I think so.  I think that's a rock hole laughing at us.  Dude.  And do you remember, was it an actual lunchroom where there was like a weird little room  to the left that you can't see off camera?  Yep.  What was that room again?  I know our office was the supply closet.  And they kind of stored stuff in it.  They gave us the supply closet as an office with no wind lunchroom. 
[00:38:00]  And there was some weird lunchroom for the floor or something?  Machines, like fucking food machines and shit.  So this asshole reporter.  Oh man, did he blindside us.  He was hiding.  He was hiding in there.  He was hiding in this weird lunchroom or this little meeting area.  We got to the elevator and he was like, hey!  With a microphone, we're like, ah!  We're going to be big stars!  You were like, cool TV, man.  Yeah, look at that camera.  Now we avoid them at all costs. 
[00:38:30]  But back then we saw a camera.  Ha ha!  Oh my God.  They didn't tell us, like, don't talk to any press.  So we're just like, hey, dude, look, it's the press, dude.  Look, this is good for us.  Yeah.  Any fucking publicity?  Any more questions?  We'll stay.  Oh God.  I don't think we ever did another show for them.  I think we were leaving for the last time right there.  You ever notice how retarded Menino sounds?  Like we're just saying the wrong things. 
[00:39:00]  Did you start from the beginning?  I haven't.  I haven't.  I'll start from a little back.  Oh, because they did the whole story.  Yeah, it's the whole dumb story.  Yeah, but Menino getting pissed off and...  Here, just play the whole piece.  Fuck it.  Okay.  This is what an apology is supposed to be for.  Well, it's the whole story from...  I mean, we do have a lot of listeners that have no idea what happened to us in Boston.  Menino was dead.  You weren't imagining it.  It was an April Fool's hoax by two radio disc jockeys. 
[00:39:30]  Tonight, those DJs are apologizing to the mayor.  But his news for us, David Robichaux, tells us Mr. Menino is not interested in apologies.  One of my relatives was just coming out of the hospital and she was...  Somebody called and asked her, can we do anything for your family during this tragedy?  And, you know, she was shocked.  My daughter, my wife, and a lot of my personal friends called the officer.  And my staff was in there crying.  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  I forgot about that. 
[00:40:00]  I forgot about that.  I was so mad that people just didn't see it our way.  I can't believe these people won't see it our way.  I can't believe it.  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  You know, the dead guy joke?  Man, they're just not seeing it our way.  That was me.  Oh, my God.  See, because his family thought he was dead.  Right.  Get it?  You get it?  Just shocked and amazed that people just didn't see it our way. 
[00:40:30]  She was screaming into the microphone.  Did anyone take a joke?  Dude, what the fuck?  It's not like, you know, we lit a bag of fucking dog shit on fire.  Right, and knocked on the door.  Right.  Run!  Right.  I think it made his kids feel better that since he was out of the state,  nobody could get in contact with him.  So for hours, they thought he was dead.  Oh, Opie said he was just joking.  It's fine.  I'm handling this like it's just a harmless little fucking joke.  That yell. 
[00:41:00]  Can I take a joke anymore?  Oh, my God.  That's classic.  Go back.  That's classic Oopster.  And the camera's on the inside of a car radio, which I love the news item.  Well, you know.  Foundry.  Yeah, my staff are some of them crying.  Can anyone take a joke anymore?  On April Fool's Day, WAAF DJ's Opie and Anthony, who like to refer to themselves as demented,  told their women that they never needed.  Nice pic.  Oh, look at that.  Wow, this is a wild man holding a fire extinguisher. 
[00:41:30]  I'm crazy.  Is there a fire?  I'll put it out.  I got it.  I'm on it.  I'm on it.  They call themselves demented.  They call themselves demented.  We didn't really call ourselves demented.  What does that even mean?  We put out a CD, decided to call it demented world.  They've confessed that they have dementia.  Wait a minute.  What?  Did we ever call ourselves demented?  No.  I don't think so.  What are you going to do with that fire extinguisher?  I'm going to save some people and put out a fire. 
[00:42:00]  They teach fire safety classes.  I don't know.  It's a demented photo.  Juan Epstein is in trouble.  Look, we were demented.  Right.  Get it?  Who knows what you're doing?  Who knows what I'm doing exactly?  I don't even know.  He looks like a wild guy there.  There's a lunatic in the house.  Look out.  Told their listeners Mayor Menino had been killed in a car accident.  At the time it aired, the mayor's wife, Angela, thought her husband was in a car on the way  to the airport, so she thought it was true.  When the mayor's staff heard about the prank, they demanded a retraction. 
[00:42:30]  We asked them to pull it, and they said, no, we're not going to pull it.  And they said, no, we're going to go on and go ahead with it.  Then we called the general manager back.  We're going to take our phone calls.  I caught up with the DJs outside their Westboro studios.  Did you hear how it started?  Well, what?  Opie goes, hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Look at the smile on the Oamster's face.  I was like, all right.  I've been waiting for this day.  Here it is.  Finally, the cameras have found us. 
[00:43:00]  They're finally here.  Oh, this is terrible.  I knew this day would come.  This is terrible.  Hey, what's up?  You guys want to put the Oamster on TV?  What's up, man?  Opie's smiling.  I'm literally ready to jump into the elevator shaft.  I'm just...  And Opie's like, I think I'm going to get a pilot out of this.  What's up?  I am camera ready.  Camera ready.  I got my long leather jacket on, because that's what Chak Chaks wear.  Oh, my God. 
[00:43:30]  This is too much.  How are we still doing radio?  I don't even know these guys.  No, I don't know who they are.  I swear I have no connection to that person.  Nope.  Still very excited.  That's right.  Hey, what's up, man?  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  Yo.  My body language says, bring it on.  You got the Oamster.  That's right.  News guy.  News guy.  I've seen you.  Your body language leaves the reporter just celebrating, like, yes.  Got him.  Yes. 
[00:44:00]  Got him.  I got one of these.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is going to be the one.  Wow.  With the DJs outside their Westboro studios.  You think saying the mayor was dead was crossing the line, though?  Yeah.  I just wish...  I just...  I feel bad that the mayor's wife heard it.  Who knew that the mayor's family is fans of the Yopi and Anthony show?  What not to do? 
[00:44:30]  That's just me being charming.  I was, like, flattered.  Like, wow.  I knew we were big in Boston.  But, man, the mayor's family listens to us.  How could you...  In what fucking world is that a good idea?  There's never been an apology with less humility than that statement.  Is there a little hair thing, too?  Can you go back?  Oh, yeah, there is.  I want to see if there's a little...  Oh, he's flipping, flipping the hair.  He's mugging to the camera.  He's not even talking to the report.  He's looking into the lens. 
[00:45:00]  This is so good.  Giving a Zoolander face.  This is perfect.  Oh, my God.  I used to be a good-looking fucking guy, though.  I'll tell you that much.  Yeah, I just wish...  I just...  I feel bad that the mayor's, you know, wife heard it.  Who knew that the mayor's family is fans of the Opie and Anthony show?  Used to be.  Aw, somebody charmed in. 
[00:45:30]  You were proud of yourself, though.  Used to be.  Dude, we are laughing our asses off at the elevator in front of the camera  where you're supposed to, you know, be contrite.  Yeah.  A little apologizing.  Thinking there's no way they're going to fire us or any of that shit.  No, how could they?  We're just going to goof around until this blows over.  This was our goodbye to Boston.  They never heard from us again.  What was that?  This was it right here.  We never got to do another show or anything.  Oh, my God. 
[00:46:00]  We disappeared for years.  Oh, my God.  And BCN brought us back for a little bit.  Yeah.  Which was very nice of them.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Honestly, I think it's stupid.  I think anyone who listens to our show for the last three years knows what we're all about.  We've done pranks like this for the last three years.  We apologize to the mayor and his family.  I am sorry, mayor and family.  Seriously.  I will not accept their apology.  Oh, God.  You always know it's sincere when you say seriously. 
[00:46:30]  Seriously.  Sorry, mayor and family.  Yes.  And Hank going like, we are sorry.  And I'm thinking, it really was.  I'm thinking, can we just get this over with, man?  We got a show to prunk for, man.  We got a show to do tomorrow.  Come on, man.  Seriously.  Seriously.  We got a show to do.  What the fuck?  We can't be distracted with this shit.  Right.  Come on.  We're the O.B.  and Anthony show.  Just because we insist that a man is dead and say it sadly and make sure that we maintain 
[00:47:00]  that it's serious.  Why would anybody believe us?  Come on.  Come on.  We do pranks.  So the next morning, when did you know that there was a problem?  Did they say come in early?  We're going to sit you for a day or two.  I don't think.  I think that was a show we did after the fact.  So that was our last show we ever did.  Yeah.  Because they let us.  Both times we got fired.  They let us go on the air the next day to do a show.  Yeah.  Trying to fucking.  That must have been the Can Anybody Take a Joke Anymore show.  Right.  Yes.  Right.  Can anybody take a joke anymore?  So then we left.  They caught us near the elevator bank. 
[00:47:30]  Bank.  And then we, yeah, we never did another show.  Excuse me, Mr. Reporter.  We have a show to prep for tomorrow.  Yeah.  We'll excuse me.  Pardon us.  But.  I think they said we're going to take you off the air just to kind of calm everyone down.  And then it just kept going and going and going.  Yeah.  And the O.B. just goes, great.  A couple days off.  That's right.  Back fresh.  That's right.  Let's see what else is on this.  This time because they went too far.  I have a great sense of your mind. 
[00:48:00]  But this is more than, this is not a laughing matter at all.  Now the mayor plans to file a complaint with the FCC and he may even sue the radio station.  WAAF management says they've offered to let the mayor throw pies in the DJ's faces to raise money for charity.  But tonight Opie and Anthony told me they will not go along with that.  And that pissed off Dave Douglas.  Yes.  He's like, I'm trying to save your jobs here.  I'm like, you really think that the mayor is going to fucking do a photo op and throw pies at our face? 
[00:48:30]  There we go.  Look out, guy.  They've got a pie.  Could you picture that?  No.  I'm like, at that point we were ready to accept whatever the fuck was going to happen because we weren't going to allow pies to be thrown at us.  Knowing that the mayor would never go for it either.  We got yelled at.  Did you throw pies at you?  We got yelled at for that.  Dude, they bought the pies.  Yeah.  I know we've told these stories a million times, but they bought the pies.  And then they're all pissed off like, you know, we spent good money on these pies. 
[00:49:00]  So then they decided to give it to cancer kids.  Why don't you go down to the cancer hospital and deliver the pies to the little cancer kids so you look better?  Well, yeah, and they hired photographers and everything.  Oh, my God.  That was a bad thing.  You gave cancer kids pies?  But refused to take pictures with them.  Yeah, we were like, get out of here.  At this point, this is ridiculous.  Yeah.  They're singing Christmas songs in July.  Because they wouldn't make it, yeah.  And the one lady goes, you know why they're singing Christmas songs?  Because that one girl right there is not going to make it to Christmas. 
[00:49:30]  I'm like, oh, and we're using them for a photo op to save our jobs?  I'm like, get the fuck out.  Looking back, you should have taken those pictures.  I was like, by the looks of her, she ain't making a 4th of July party.  Exactly.  Oof.  It was horrible.  It was horrible.  It was an awful thing to say.  It was.  I hope she lived.  Jimmy goes, she didn't.  And then they're mad that we wouldn't do the photo op with the pies.  And then, I don't know.  The pie! 
[00:50:00]  And then, fuck it, Bruce Mittman.  I guess we've got to complete all the stories.  And Bruce Mittman, like, jumps out of a bush and shakes the mayor's hand.  That is a true story.  He thought, if I could get in the paper shaking the mayor's hand, it'll show everyone that  the mayor's cool with what happened.  Yeah.  Find the picture.  It's there.  That was a smart move.  He hired a photographer, and he just kind of started stalking the mayor.  And he pretty much jumped out of a bush and just reached his hand out. 
[00:50:30]  The mayor's going to shake anyone's hands.  And then realized, after the fact, that he just shook the hand of the guy that was running  the station that ran the prank.  I must say.  There it is.  There it is.  There it is.  Wow.  That's the fucking picture.  Right.  You remember?  The caption is accurate, though.  It says,  WAAF station general manager, Bruce Mittman, on the right, tried to apologize to Mayor Thomas  Meneo last Friday.  Yeah.  Well, because in the end, Bruce Mittman loved us to death. 
[00:51:00]  They really were.  He was desperate.  He was like, fuck, I've got to save my boys.  They were back.  He was fucking peddling as fast as he could to try to save our gig.  Good old Brucie.  Look at that picture.  I don't need to do the pie thing.  We did that great TV interview.  Yeah.  You don't see that?  Didn't you see our wonderful apology?  See how good I looked?  Yeah.  That's right, Sam.  I was about your age there.  Much more handsome than me.  It's like, yeah, well, you know, we apologize to the mayor and his family, but I've got to 
[00:51:30]  hop on my board and do some surfing.  Mahalo, motherfucker.  That was so fucking funny.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Wowie kazowie.  Back to Riley Cooper.  Oh.  That's where we were.  We're all over the place today.  What's that one?  What is this?  It's just on the same, like, I guess that picture came from your Twitter feed. 
[00:52:00]  It did?  And so then the next one on the Twitter feed.  Oh.  Bobo getting painted up like Kamala for our Thanksgiving party.  That was our Thanksgiving thing where we put on the Thanksgiving show.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Wow.  Look what's next.  Oh, Wiener's pick.  Remember that?  Wiener's dick.  Unbelievable.  It is erect.  It goes off to the left.  Oh.  Anyway, so Riley Cooper says the N-word and the reporters got him and here's him in the 
[00:52:30]  middle of his apology, which was a little different than our apology.  Just a tad.  From back in the day.  With my actions.  When you face your teammates, specifically your African-American teammates, what will you  say?  I'm going to tell them exactly what I'm telling you guys, how extremely sorry I am.  I should have never said what I said.  And the ones that, most of the ones that know me, which excludes kind of the rookies coming 
[00:53:00]  in, they know what type of person I am.  Can you believe we live in a place where a word is like this magical thing that you just  can't say?  I, I, I, it's beyond me.  But it was, it was, it was captured by somebody.  Right.  And then posted.  Like, no one is attacking the fucking voyeuristic, sneaky nature.  Right.  Of what we have become.  That's acceptable.  Yeah.  I mean, I understand he's a public figure and he's out in public, but basically someone 
[00:53:30]  just eavesdrops on him and then puts it up to be a dick.  And we don't go, wow, nobody respects even a moment of privacy in public.  No, no.  All right, that's what you get.  Well, man, you people out there, keep bellyaching about the NSA dummies.  Yeah.  Keep crying how your privacy is violated.  It has nothing to do with the government.  It's, it's, it's, you're, you're all doing it to yourself already fucking.  And then all of a sudden you think, you know, the government is eavesdropping.  Now that's a problem.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Everything you're doing is being recorded somewhere.  The second something happens out there, you see 15 people's hands go up with fucking 
[00:54:00]  phones in their hand to record the event and put it up on a unbelievably public forum.  But you're worried about the government?  Yeah.  Are you kidding me?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I kind of laughed at that story.  I just assumed that was always happening.  It's a stone.  I love that.  I really do love the fact that everyone in this country now is fucking panicking because  Ricky, I'm pressing on information.  Fuck you.  Where, where, where are people supporting this guy? 
[00:54:30]  He's a dick.  Yeah.  Why aren't people attacking the fucking, it wasn't like he was doing an interview and  said that.  No.  That was just a moment in his life talking to somebody.  Right.  Someone grabs it and puts it up and everyone is fine with it.  But yet, man, you fucking find out your shit might be getting listened to.  And boy, people are outraged.  Yep.  I love it.  Now, of course, the Eagles had to fine him because, you know, they're in a tough, they're  in a tough spot. 
[00:55:00]  So, I'm not surprised by, you know, them fining Riley Cooper.  I wish they didn't.  But as long as they don't fucking, you know, get rid of him, that would be ridiculous.  Right?  All right.  We're running a little late and we got Kennedy outside the studio.  So, we're going to take a break anyway.  She'll, she'll be cool.  Yeah.  The book's called The Kennedy Chronicles and we'll talk to her next.  Stay there.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[00:55:30]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Show.  Show.  We got Kennedy coming in from MTV.  The old MTV days.  The Kennedy Chronicles is the new book.  A book.  And we saw her outside the studio yesterday and we were trying to squeeze her in.  We just didn't have time.  So, we said, please come back.  Don't sit.  Don't sit next to Jimmy's stinky breakfast.  No.  Breakfast.  It's ass.  It really is terrible.  There's no, there's no breakfast.  No.  I was telling Anthony, I got to start by thanking you because Ben Stiller bought us dinner because 
[00:56:00]  of you.  What happened?  Way back in the day.  I was working at a radio station on Long Island BAB and we did a little ski trip at the  ski house.  Remember when MTV was doing the ski house?  Yes.  And we're having a nice steak dinner in this big fucking restaurant and you're having dinner  with Ben Stiller.  So, I don't know what that was about.  Maybe because you guys were just working together or maybe you were following.  No.  There was no fucking.  There was no fucking.  Okay.  I went to a strip bar with him and Steven Dorf and Guy Ossiri one night. 
[00:56:30]  Right.  Okay.  And they were all very embarrassed because they were getting lap dances and boners and  then I was sitting there like hee hee hee hee hee.  Were you pointing and laughing at the boners?  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  And they were more excited.  So, the girls I...  Never take your lady friends to strip club.  No.  The girls I were with that night, they were like, holy fuck, that's Ben Stiller.  And they were freaking out.  And they were kind of trying to get Ben Stiller back to the condo for an after hours party.  And this was before Ben Stiller was Ben Stiller.  Yeah.  I mean, he had directed Reality Bites and Cable Guy, but he wasn't...  He was on his way, though. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  The girls I were...  We knew who he was and we knew who you were, obviously.  And you finally had it.  You're like, fuck these fucking broads.  So, you got up and you went to the DJ booth and pointed at our table and said, these bitches  are having an after...  I don't know if you said bitches, but it was pretty out there.  They're having an after hours party, a condo number, boom.  And you kind of threw the mic down kind of aggressively and went back to your table.  So, then it was time to pay the bill.  And the waitress comes up to us and goes, oh, your dinner's taken care of. 
[00:57:30]  And we all look and she goes, you know, that guy's paying.  And there's Ben, like, awkwardly waving like, hi.  Oh, I love the apologies.  Hi, sorry.  That is the best.  That is the best.  Sorry.  I've always wanted to tell you this.  Oh, when people apologize on my behalf.  Isn't that fantastic?  And I don't think you were in the wrong or anything.  You were like, holy fuck, enough with these bitches.  I didn't say bitches.  Or whatever.  Yeah.  I would have said cunts.  Enough of these broads.  And then you went up and.  Can I say that? 
[00:58:00]  That was really.  Of course.  I like that you said that.  That's a good time to ask, too.  Right.  We like that.  Yeah, we actually like hearing that.  Yeah, absolutely.  So, I've always had that story.  And I figured one day I'd be able to tell you.  I hope the steak was worth it.  It was good.  It was fun.  It was a good night.  I was laughing pretty hard.  It was good.  But, so, the new book's called the Kennedy Chronicles.  What?  Come on.  Hi.  What is in there?  There's.  When I went back and actually edited it and had to read the book.  Because, you know, you write chapter by chapter. 
[00:58:30]  And sometimes things are out of order.  And I, you know, I would sit and try to figure out the order.  When I got the copy edit.  Which is where they go through.  Like a grammar school teacher goes through and puts commas in.  Oh, yeah.  They should be.  Just stupid things out.  That dumb shit.  They make really passive aggressive comments in the margin.  Oh, no.  Did you mean to say this?  Oh, no.  Yeah.  A lot of people.  Copy editors are awful.  They're awful.  Oh.  They're bores.  And they don't care if it changes the context of the joke. 
[00:59:00]  They want the grammar proper.  And it's interesting that you say that.  Because I made two references to.  I referred to myself as appearing autistic.  And the copy editor flagged that as offensive language.  But then I went through the Word document and put in the word retarded.  And that came up like 700 times.  And she never flagged that.  And I thought that was really hypocritical.  Of course.  Wait.  She had the right.  Why would they flag offensive language?  Or is that just to let you know?  Because you asked them to?  Or why would they do that?  No.  She was like, this term could be offensive to some people. 
[00:59:30]  And I'm like, afflicted with midgetry also is.  But I left that in.  Midgetry.  We have just lost our minds in this country.  Yeah.  So now you can't write an honest book?  Mein Kampf is for sale.  Right.  Ted Barnes and Noble.  Is that flagged?  The margin notes on that one?  But does that mean you had to leave it out?  Or they were just letting you know?  Okay.  Good.  Oh, you did?  Okay.  Good.  Good.  They were just letting you know.  And I actually wrote angrily in the margin.  Oh, good.  You know what? 
[01:00:00]  Like, I was not talking about autistic children.  Right.  When I described something as retarded, I was not talking about the intellectually challenged.  Right.  Of course.  Margin fight.  Margin fight.  Yeah.  And then I get another.  I get the next word.  It's like, oh, no, you didn't.  I was like, it's an old school classroom desk.  Yeah.  Your mom was so big.  Like the words on the desk.  Right.  Right.  Good for you that you kept it in.  That's good.  Yeah.  Did you have sex with Michael Jordan?  I just need to know.  No.  I had sex with my husband.  That was it.  I mean, that's the point. 
[01:00:30]  And I didn't even mean, like, I didn't sit down and write an outline and say, you know  what I'm going to have is a recurring theme.  Right.  My poor, tired hymen.  Like, I'm going to leave that throughout the book in every chapter, my adolescent longing  that is never fulfilled.  Gotcha.  But it's like, it could have been called, like, the Blue Balls Chronicles because there  were so many boys in there that I kissed and didn't have.  Well, did you have a chance to have sex with them?  I would have if I lost the dice game.  But I won, so I got the Nets tickets.  I'm so confused. 
[01:01:00]  Wait, that was up for grabs?  If you win, you get Nets tickets.  And if he wins, you get sex with you?  No, it wasn't sex.  I mean, it wasn't explicitly sex, but it was, you'll come back to my hotel room.  Oh, wow.  Oh, that means sex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was hoping it didn't, so I read in the book, like, what would happen if that really  meant sex?  And it ended up with, like, me telling him, no, I've never done this before, and him rubbing  chapstick between his palms trying to create de facto lube.  De facto lube.  We just got the book, so we haven't been able to read some chapters, but if you look at the 
[01:01:30]  mainstream...  Oh, that's so cute that you're insinuating you're literate.  I read a book every once in a while.  But the mainstream media is kind of hinting that there might have been sex with you and  Michael Jordan.  That's how they're promoting it.  No, I think they have the same longing of unrealized potential that I do.  Right, okay.  And I'm like, wow, what would it have been like?  Right.  What would have the hemorrhaging in the emergency room been like after a night with Michael  George?  Wouldn't it be great if you only had, like, five and a half thin? 
[01:02:00]  How great would that be?  Poor guy.  Five and a half thin.  Yeah, he's a great ball player, and he's 6'6", and he's just a small, thin penis.  He's a twizzler dick.  Yeah.  But you were married the whole time you were at MTV?  No, I started dating my husband, who was my boyfriend at the time, in 95.  So I got there in 92, met Dave in 95, and then finally, finally got it on.  It wasn't just crazy sex stuff going on at MTV.  Just going in left and right.  Yeah, yeah, because that's the impression. 
[01:02:30]  Pick up my bra in the makeup room.  Right.  Boobies.  No, no.  I mean, there was for some people.  Yeah.  And I tried.  I would have.  So I guess that guy that called up early was lying.  Oh, yeah, there's a guy with a story.  Some guy called up, and he was like, yeah, I worked at MTV back in the day, and me and  Kennedy went into the bathroom.  Oh, yeah, that was us.  Yeah, just, you know, 12 dicks in my face.  We called him a lump of shit, a liar.  Yeah, we protected you.  Don't worry about it. 
[01:03:00]  And you're like, listen, Sumner Redstone.  Isn't he a lovely man?  Oh, boy.  No, I was straight edge.  I did not have, I didn't have sex.  I wanted to.  How many years were you on there?  Five and a half.  Yeah, you were famous, man.  Holy fuck.  You don't realize that now.  You were famous.  What do you mean you didn't realize?  Because I didn't watch MTV.  And, you know, I would go places and just wear, you know, a wool cap. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  When you wear glasses, people, you know, they don't recognize you.  Wow, really?  People didn't recognize you?  If I had, like, big hair and, you know, purple lipstick.  Right.  And I went to a rock show.  Like, if I went to a Soul Asylum show, I was Madonna.  Soul Asylum.  What a way trade.  Oh, good.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, so it was all, like, dependent on where you were and stuff and what you were wearing.  Yeah, it was all contextual.  I don't know about that.  I think you're downplaying it.  MTV was huge back then. 
[01:04:00]  But I didn't watch it, so I didn't know, like, how much we were on.  And, you know, we would go take VJ segments and we would end up being on eight hours a  day.  Right.  You know, it would take, like, a half hour to tape eight hours worth of programming and  you're on all day long.  Right.  So, you know, kids come home from school and that's all there was.  What were you doing before that?  Like, how'd you get the gig initially?  Well, I was doing radio.  I was an intern at a radio station at K-Rock in L.A.  Yeah.  And then I used to Hector, my boss, every day and be like, you should totally put me 
[01:04:30]  on the air.  I'd be so fun.  And he's like, yeah, you can leave.  And then one day the overnight guy quit.  Here's my shot.  Well, and then they hired Tammy Heidi from Boston, who was, like, a huge jock in Boston,  and then moved her to middays.  And they didn't have anyone to do the overnights.  And they were scrambling.  And this was a radio station that regularly put interns on the air.  It wasn't like, you know, I was this beacon and everyone else, you know, they were broadcasting 
[01:05:00]  icons.  Yeah.  Like, every other person who was on overnights had been fetching bagels earlier in the day.  Yeah.  And so I got a job a couple nights a week.  And then I started working for Kevin and Bean in the morning.  And then my boss from the radio station went to MTV as a senior VP of programming.  Oh, man.  Oh, wow.  I got to do it.  That works.  That's amazing.  Yeah, it's great.  Good for you.  What is a VGA audition?  What do you have to do?  Just kind of throw to a song?  Or what do they have you do?  Yeah.  I mean, it would be like a radio audition where, you know, you're essentially doing breaks  and talking about music. 
[01:05:30]  And you have to show that you know something about music and pop culture and try and be...  That's why I didn't get the gig.  Because I actually...  Did you audition?  I had an audition when we first moved to New York.  Yeah.  Do you have that tape?  Actually, it was for VH1.  I've been looking for this tape forever.  I do not officially have the tape.  Oh, my God.  But I want that more than another angle on the JFK assassination.  I want that tape.  Me and Anthony were at Caroline's for a Stephen Lynch show.  And one of the people from MTV slash VH1, you know, pulled me aside and said, come on  in for an audition. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah, there's a tape somewhere.  Oh, I love to see that.  I've never seen it.  But I obviously did not get the gig.  In the 90s, there's no tape.  Really?  I actually had...  Like, MTV was really cool about this book because they knew it wasn't going to be a  salacious MTV tell-all where I exposed the dirt of the network and ruined them, finally.  It was really, you know, an idealized first-person account.  But they assigned me a PA who, you know, went and got as much tape as she could.  But there were chapters, specific chapters, where I wanted the interviews. 
[01:06:30]  Like, I wanted the No Doubt interview and Henry Rollins and Radiohead.  And she couldn't find it.  They don't have the...  Wow.  Are you kidding me?  I'm not kidding.  They have to have them somewhere.  It's got to be somewhere.  One of those deep vaults.  And maybe she went through the first file cabinet and went, eh, no, no, no.  Maybe they were just lazy.  Maybe they were lazy over there.  How do you not save that stuff?  They have to.  Although a lot of the Tonight Shows are lost because they started taping over it.  Some of the oldest Carsons are lost, and they were just used over again and re-taped.  Right.  Well, they probably figured they did so many shows. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's going to care about this?  Yeah, that Johnny Carson flash in the pan.  Well, you were at the end of the golden era of MTV, right?  I think so.  It didn't go too much further after you, I don't think.  The music didn't know.  No.  And someone asked me yesterday, what do you think took the music out of MTV?  And I think, you guys get so much food.  It's crazy.  You want some place?  Yeah.  We try to eat healthy blueberries and oatmeal, you know.  Oh, that's wonderful.  We're like little Roman emperors.  We don't want to be fat DJs.  Is the man with the lady hair going to feed you with his fingers? 
[01:07:30]  Nice thing.  He's the intern.  We just don't even know his name.  I don't know what one was it.  I think it was Chivo.  Taylor.  Yeah, something like that.  Who were some of the VJs after you?  I'm trying to remember.  Carson Daly.  Don Lewis.  Carson came after you.  Carson and I overlapped.  Oh, right.  Of course.  Because TRL.  Right.  Okay.  But I think it was TRL because when they realized that they could play 10 seconds of  a video.  Right.  And that's all they had to play.  They were like, how about we play no seconds? 
[01:08:00]  So someone probably, you know, put that out there in a meeting and everyone went, yeah.  You know what?  But that shit was so frustrating because some of those songs were pretty hot and you wanted  to kind of see the whole video.  And they would come back.  And there's Carson Daly.  I'm like, no, I want to see more of the video.  That was, you're like, no, it wasn't.  That was a quarter of it.  Not even.  Didn't the real world hurt it, too?  That was just the tip.  Yeah, yeah.  Just the tip.  They just put in the tip.  A little bit.  A little bit.  The real world, too, right?  Because that kind of changed their programming a lot.  Yeah, and that was 92.  So that debuted in 92 before I got there. 
[01:08:30]  And there was a lot of controversy about that show.  And, you know, people are like, ooh, it's fake.  It's, you know, or it's really dangerous and you shouldn't be showing people like this.  Yeah, I do remember the controversy.  Everything's controversial.  Yeah, everyone has to make something out of it.  I remember when Survivor debuted.  They're like, oh, people are going to die.  They're going to die.  Is this what we should be having people do?  It's kind of a gutter.  We're putting people on exhibit.  All right.  Stop.  Relax.  But the early real worlds, that was real reality shows. 
[01:09:00]  Way more so.  Way more than now.  Now it's ridiculous.  Everything's a storyline.  Of course.  You watch any reality show.  And everything is so forced and pre-produced.  Yes.  And it's because no one wants to sit there and go through 24 hours of footage.  I read, I think it took six months to get a real world.  They had to be in a house for six months.  Yeah, I'm sure.  And nowadays, they're barely there three weeks to film a whole, you know, season.  It's called assisted reality now.  Yeah, they're going to be like, okay, so we're going to do group anal at three, and then you 
[01:09:30]  guys are going to get loaded, and you're going to vomit on yourselves by 4.30, and we need  a heart out here.  Yeah, the fight will be a good ending for this one.  Pedro and Puck.  I mean, come on.  That shit was great.  Okay, in the book, I talk about taking Puck home to Portland, because I had interviewed  him for a late night fight.  Did he punch you?  Did he wipe a booger on you?  I broke my wrist, and I blame it on him.  You know what he did?  He wounded my family with his inane, boring stories. 
[01:10:00]  Oh my God, that's great.  And my parents are Midwesterners, and they don't understand that sort of malignant narcissism.  He just takes over, and he just blanketed them with stink, and to his friend, the orangutan  trainer.  So he was such an ass that by the end of the two or three days, my brothers and I were  like, let's pretend we're on the real world. 
[01:10:30]  And my brother was like, I'll be Muhammad, you be Rachel.  And they're like, Puck, you can play yourself.  And he started crying.  What?  This is so mean.  I don't know why you guys are doing this.  Yeah, he got all emotional.  What the fuck?  Why did you have him in your house?  Because he convinced me he had nowhere to go for Christmas.  And my mom was like, well, honey, just bring him here.  Oh, no.  We'll have such a nice time.  We'll just have some Bosco, and we'll open presents, and we'll have a birthday cake for  Jesus.  It'd be wonderful. 
[01:11:00]  Did she regret that?  Oh, she still does.  To this day, right?  She brings it up.  Yeah, she's like, who is that rock or pick?  What was his name?  He was awful.  And then I went to, I'm the only person in my family who ever went to church.  And so I was going to church on Christmas, and Puck's like, you should take me.  And I'm like, I don't think that's a good idea.  Like, I think that you will catch on fire if you walk into a church.  And he wore lederhosen. 
[01:11:30]  Really?  What?  Yes, and I was too tired.  I had a broken wrist, and I didn't want to fight, and I was already exhausted, and I  was like, yeah.  He's got to always, it was always making everything about him, yeah.  And making it difficult.  And so now when I go back home, there are all these Greeks that come up to me like, why  did you bring Puck in later?  Oh, my God, still.  Why did you do this?  Why?  Still.  I guess.  Wow.  What happened to Puck?  He's an ass.  You know what he is now?  He's like, allegedly, in the recesses of my memory, a wife-beating drunken driver who 
[01:12:00]  got a DUI with his kid in the car.  Right.  Yeah, and then.  I mean, he's done some things that's like, you're such, like, I contemplated not writing  about him because of the horrible things he's done just in the last five years.  I have heard, yeah.  I love this.  There's domestic violence.  There's a restraining order.  D-Way, yeah.  Yeah.  Just really.  With a kid in the car.  With a kid in the car.  It's like, you know what?  Go get bombed and drive off a cliff.  Right.  That's fine.  Without the kid.  Without the kid.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  Unbelievable.  Was he mean to you on that?  Was he mean to your family or just a boob?  He was a boob.  I mean, he tried to be like, woo, this is me.  And my friend was like, yeah, we're kind of over it.  Yeah.  I'm not really impressed by you at all.  So what did you end up doing after MTV?  I moved to Seattle.  So I fell in love with my boyfriend in 95.  And then in 97, my contract is up in December.  And I knew that I wanted to leave.  Like, I didn't want to be the person who stayed at the party too long.  Oh, yeah.  And I was worried that if I signed another deal, like, that's all I would ever do. 
[01:13:00]  But there was still that risk anyway.  Like, even if I stayed there.  So my boyfriend at the time, he's now my husband.  I love you, Dave.  He has satellite in his truck.  He broke his back.  Wow.  And so I had just finished shooting at the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach.  I had a great day.  And his friend called me frantically.  And they're like, Dave just broke his back.  He's in an ambulance.  He might be paralyzed.  Jeez.  And it was like, holy shit. 
[01:13:30]  Jesus.  So I went up to Portland where he was.  And he had major back surgery.  And, you know, they're like, well, he might be paralyzed after the surgery.  So, and you realize in that moment when someone's really hurt that you love, you realize how much you love him, how much you love them.  And he looked at me and he was like, I don't want you to be my girlfriend.  I want to marry you.  I'm like, I'm moving to Seattle.  And so I did.  So I moved to Seattle and we bought a house on Lake Washington.  It was really great.  And we'd play mini golf. 
[01:14:00]  And then I had to start working because that doesn't pay for itself.  And then I started doing talk radio in Seattle.  Oh, that's right.  You are in the business.  I know that.  Okay.  And you're still doing that?  I do.  I did talk radio for years.  Now I do a music show in the morning in L.A.  You were successful doing talk radio.  Of course.  I know that.  That was really fun.  I love talk.  And I love, I still fill in on KFI for John and Ken and stuff like that.  And that's great.  I mean, that is such a focused challenge.  It's like anything other than a four hour show where you're talking alone without taking 
[01:14:30]  phone calls is super easy compared to all that.  I mean, I think so many people in our world would have loved to be on MTV to actually walk  away from that.  I can't imagine.  Did you feel like they were going to want you to leave?  Or did you feel like I have to walk away?  She easily could have done another few years.  No, I think I could have stayed.  But to make that decision going, I'm walking away from MTV.  It was very anxiety inducing.  I can imagine.  And I talk about in the books, like having panic attacks, like I'm leaving everything 
[01:15:00]  I know, like everything I know professionally and socially.  My roommate worked at MTV.  We were roommates for five years.  She was an executive at MTV.  You know, I met, I didn't meet my boyfriend through MTV, but he was so wrapped up in that  world.  And all I knew professionally and socially was there.  You know, not to mention being on TV and wondering like, maybe I'm never going to work  in broadcasting again.  Like that was such a possibility.  Did you ever regret it?  Was there a time like after like two or three years later, you're like, oh, fuck. 
[01:15:30]  No, no.  I really liked being in Seattle.  I was more surprised at the blowback I got politically trying to get jobs outside of MTV and people  being like, yeah.  When I wrote, I wrote a book for, an advice book for girls in 99 and had a hard time finding  a publisher because you're not going to believe this, but publishers in New York are very liberal.  And so they were like, oh, she's the Republican.  And so that was difficult.  But other than that, you know, I've always tried to do kind of fun, interesting stuff. 
[01:16:00]  And so I did a game show on Game Show Network.  And I did a show.  I did Pitchman on Discovery Channel.  And I'm a correspondent for Stossel on Fox Business.  And he's amazing.  Stossel.  Yeah.  Because he's a full on libertarian and sends me to do like these great stories.  And I climbed over the border fence into Mexico a couple weeks ago.  I drove drunk with the L.A. County Sheriff.  I mean, the L.A. County Sheriff's Farm got me drunk.  Yeah, yeah.  And I drove around the cones.  And I just went to Detroit and hung out with urban farmers. 
[01:16:30]  Oh, man.  It was fantastic.  Urban farmers.  It's an urban farmer.  It's like beekeepers and stuff who are squatting on city land in Detroit growing kale.  And they have chickens and bees and all this stuff.  And, you know, it's like hippies with beards.  I'm like, yeah, man.  It's like Thunderdome Detroit.  It is.  That's why it's so great.  It's amazing.  Like, stop trying to make it Chicago.  Like, let the earth swallow the sea whole.  Let it just be, right?  Barter town.  Yes.  And then let it become this strange agrarian, like, neo-libertarian experiment of awesomeness. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, that's wild.  Yeah.  Did that piece run yet?  I want to see that.  Yeah, that was last week.  I'll look it up online.  Did you go by the bees at all?  I did.  I walked by the bees.  And I was like, am I going to get stung?  This would be cool.  Like, maybe Detroit bees are, like, even harder.  Yeah, right?  Yeah.  There's no, are you going to get stung?  What's that?  I would never walk by a beehive.  Ever.  Really?  It wasn't a hive.  I mean, they're like in boxes.  Yeah, I know.  You just sort of buzz around.  But there's always a few on the outside of the boxes. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah.  There's got to be one ornery one.  Yeah, there's a few that just don't want to be in the box.  Yeah, they were buzzing.  It's like pit bulls.  Right.  You know, everyone says, oh, no, my dog is so sweet and nice.  Until he's latching onto a tother's throat.  Right.  But, you know, they're so cute dogs.  Those beekeepers that don't even wear the suits, they're just out there and bees are on their  hand and they go, meh, and they're like this.  Yeah, they're just brushing them off.  If I see a bee and I'm not vigilant, if I'm not vigilant, though, around a bee, one will  just go, meh, and just fly right into me, stinger first. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  And they're just like, meh, wiping them off.  They're just assholes.  Meh.  Fuck.  What do they do to you?  Relax.  Yeah, they're like the frustrated accountants of the animal world.  Yes.  So, I was watching a special on Japanese hornets and there was a guy catching them with  no gloves and those are the biggest hornets in the world.  They're horrible.  They are terrible.  They're horrible bees.  And he was just catching them in a little net and then whispering them into a honey jar  and making them drown so he could make this special potent honey. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, yeah, because it's probably some wiener elixir.  What a prick.  Yeah.  Did you see the video on YouTube, this is my favorite guy cleaning the poop in the cobra  cage?  No.  Yes.  That's insane.  Oh.  Yes.  He's like in a zoo and a cobra pen and he's just like cleaning up the cobra poop.  Like it's nothing.  And he's got like 20.  They're all like 20 doing that cobra thing.  Yeah.  Making the zombie sound from Walking Dead.  They're all like.  And he doesn't even think.  Can you pop it up real fast?  And he doesn't even think twice about it.  He's like, yeah, it's just my job.  Who cares?  Yeah.  He's like, eh, bite me. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  Go ahead.  I dare you.  I make four cents a day.  We're in Indonesia.  Right.  Eat a bag of dicks.  All of you.  You're naked on the cover of your book there, Kennedy.  Oh.  Yeah.  Side nude.  Pretty cool.  Yeah.  And I like my daughters.  And I should add.  My daughters are like, why are you naked?  And I was like, I'm not.  I'm wearing a bodysuit.  Oh, God.  It looks like I'm naked, doesn't it?  And my eight-year-old was like, you know, about that whole bodysuit thing.  That's naked.  She goes, I can see your tattoo and your side boobie.  And I was like, oh, yeah.  They do that.  It's called Photoshop.  Yeah.  They Photoshopped it in. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah.  But Bummy's not naked.  I should add looking good, by the way.  It's not cool to just say you're naked.  Oh, yeah.  It's a great show.  I want to add looking good, too, by the way.  That's from 1994.  You're on a mule.  Yeah.  Very good.  You're the first person who got that, because everyone's like, you know, I feel bad for  the horse.  That's not a horse.  That's a mule, man.  Look.  Yeah.  You can see his little funny head.  Yeah.  What was the photo shoot for?  It was for Us Magazine.  Mark Seliger took that.  And so the mock-up that they did at the publishing company was the least attractive photo you've 
[01:20:00]  ever seen of any human being.  Right.  So they found some free, horrible photo of me where my face looks, I mean, from the  picture, it looks like I'm making this sound.  Eeeeee!  Like, and it would be repellent.  If you saw that in a bookstore, and I gave it to my husband, he's like, oh, hell no.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's like, I would actively walk away.  I would walk out of the bookstore if I saw it.  So then my editor was like, we need a picture from the 90s.  I'm like, I must have taken one good photo. 
[01:20:30]  And then I remembered that with Mark Seliger.  And so I just called his studio, like, cold call him and been like, hi, you don't know  me because you're 12.  But back in 1994, I took a great picture with Mark, and I was wondering if I could use it  for my book.  And he let me, and that makes him awesome.  That's awesome.  Absolutely.  I didn't realize this was from 94.  You haven't aged there, Kennedy.  You're very kind.  I'm serious.  You look good, man.  That's pretty nice.  So what's going to be in, what's in this book, I should say?  We should try to sell some books today. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, you're so kind.  Instead of the Michael Jordan story.  Right.  He's a big gambler, man.  Oh, yeah.  That's why I knew when I pulled out the dice.  Right.  It was on.  Right.  Did you get to see him, you know, gambling?  I gambled with him.  That was a wager.  But I mean, like, the big numbers?  Like, he would lose it.  The big numbers was my lady cherry.  Like, that was it.  That was what we were gambling for.  Because I was like, do you want me to go get $400?  Right.  Which was the most I could take out of the ATM.  I'm basic cable.  He was pushing millions, man.  He would lose millions. 
[01:21:30]  That's what I said.  Like, he would lose my salary in an hour.  Yes.  In seconds.  On one hand of blackjack in any given casino.  And play some blackjack.  But Jordan's got your beat.  Oh, please.  Of course he does.  And goes pretty high.  He's a little nutty with it.  I play, like, three hands at once.  Oh, yeah, that stuff.  I've seen my dad doing that.  It's crazy.  Yeah, three hands.  Like, that's just confidence.  Max bet on all three.  Yeah.  Double down.  Split note.  He's in the high roller room.  Before you know it, it's like...  He's up there.  You've got a lot of cash on there.  Are you good?  I mean, what's your lifetime average?  Have you made more than you've lost? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah, I absolutely think I've made more than I've lost.  Okay.  Yeah.  I've had some pretty bad beats.  Every gambler says that, though.  Yeah, but...  Yeah, my dad never would tell us when he'd lose.  So I'm calling you out on that.  He'd be like, I won 60 grand this weekend in Reno.  No, I talk about when I lose.  I mean, you're going, oh, that wasn't good.  You really think you're up?  Yeah, I think I am.  I think so.  Do you think he's bluffing?  Have you ever thought of an intervention?  I know, right?  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Do you want to start a couple of different things? 
[01:22:30]  Please.  Why?  Do I think he's lying?  No, I think he might be...  I think he's right around there.  I think he's right around.  I think I'm doing all right.  Even or a little up,  I think he might tell the truth.  I think I'm a little up.  Even if you're a little up,  that's way ahead.  Because there's some people who've like...  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Everything.  Terrible.  Here's the cobra video.  Oh.  For reference.  Oh, he's right there with him.  Oh, yeah, that's right.  He's just throwing it like a rubber snake.  Because he needs to get to that area of the pen.  Look at that one. 
[01:23:00]  It's like striking.  He's like...  And look at the one over on the right.  I thought you've seen this video.  I have.  I'm amazed by it.  No, I mean these guys.  No, I never saw this one.  Why does he put them nicely?  Yeah, all of them behind them.  Do we have sound?  I want to hear like the horrible sound  these things are making.  What is he getting at?  Walking Dead zombies.  Yeah, the...  Oh, those are eggs.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he just sweeps them away.  And look what he's wearing.  He's not even wearing shoes.  He's got flip-flops on.  He's got flip-flops.  I just want to be in a suit of armor. 
[01:23:30]  Right.  This is craziness.  What an asshole.  Just sweeping them up.  What is his little broom?  He's got a dumb little homemade broom.  I wouldn't do that if they were rubber snakes.  Yeah, a stick with bristles.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What about the snakes behind him?  He's not even looking behind him.  Oh, my God.  Get the hell out of here.  It struck out of him.  He didn't even flinch.  Then he does this freaky deaky shaman thing in the snake's face.  He didn't even flinch when that thing struck at him.  That's crazy.  Well, if he put them nicely, they probably wouldn't hate him so much, but he throws them. 
[01:24:00]  He throws them like they're rubber.  Guys are a dick.  Like they're hoses.  Fuck God.  Why aren't they biting him?  This guy's magic.  It's the best sound ever.  That, if I heard that once.  Of course.  Look, he's right next to the one that's cut back ready to hit him.  Lecturing him.  Look at all of them.  There's like 50 of them ready to strike.  I can't even believe this.  The poop and the eggs.  Like, Bernard, you're such a dick.  You come in here every day.  Look at all their little heads.  They're all pissed off.  Like, each of us could kill you ten times. 
[01:24:30]  Look at them all pissed off.  Like, did this guy just throw us?  Did this guy?  How dare he?  Yeah.  This guy's an asshole.  Look at that.  That's a great video.  I am amazed by this guy.  And there are a few behind him, and he knows they're not going to sneak up and get him.  Right.  And this is actually my video from Detroit.  Ah, that's...  Yeah.  All right, tell us about the book.  Come on.  I'm amazed.  Let's sell some books.  All right, let's sell some books.  Come on, people.  It's like a telethon.  Hallelujah.  We're cured cancer.  The book, actually, it leads to virility. 
[01:25:00]  It's known that if you read this book, you will have an eight-hour erection.  That's nice.  Also known as priapism.  Oh.  Oh.  It's very tantric.  Oh, that's when the boner doesn't go down.  Yeah, then you've got to go somewhere, and they hit it with a mallet.  Oh, what is a fucking cartoon character?  That is painful.  Kennedy, what's your name?  Lisa Kennedy Montgomery.  Lisa Kennedy Montgomery.  Yeah.  That's pretty good.  That's a fucking fancy name. 
[01:25:30]  Well, my parents wanted to call me Kennedy, but my dad, who just thought less of me, was  like, she's not going to be able to spell it.  Oh.  Let's just call her Lisa.  Oh, no.  Like every other girl born in the 70s.  Lisa.  How did your boyfriend at the time break his back?  In a motocross race.  So he was a pro snowboarder for 10 years.  And, you know, it's like, yeah, the smartest thing you can do when you're a snowboarder,  you're like, let me get on a motorcycle and race other dudes.  So he flew off a jump and landed on his butt and just burst one of the vertebrae. 
[01:26:00]  And he was very lucky, very lucky he was not paralyzed because he was for a little bit.  And then, being a genius, a year and a half later, he was at a snowboard contest in California.  And I will not forgive him for this one.  He decided to be the first one off a jump in a big air contest and overshot the landing  by about 40 feet and just fell out of the air and broke his back again. 
[01:26:30]  Wow.  Second time in two years?  Yeah.  Jesus.  And that's every once in a while.  Like, you know how it is when you're in a relationship.  Like, you ruminate on something, you let it go, and then you just bring it up out of nowhere.  Yeah, right.  That's the one.  I'm like, why did you do that?  And still to this day.  And that was in 1998.  Wow.  But I'm like, why would you do that?  Huh?  Of course.  Yeah.  How's his back now?  It's funny because his back's good, but now he has a hernia.  He's got it.  Like, he surfs, he skateboards, he snowboards all the time. 
[01:27:00]  But he's got a hernia.  And so the other day, like, something popped out of it.  Wow.  And so, and the hernia's, like, right by the groin.  And so he's out with our daughter.  They're on a walk in the neighborhood.  And he's got his hands down his pants.  And he's, like, trying to poke it back in.  And he realizes, like, he looks like a total pervert.  Oh, my God.  And so he's, like, trying to wrangle our very active four-year-old.  And he's like, we've got to go.  We've got to go.  Oh, my God.  Someone's going to call the police.  Oh, my God.  All right, sicko.  He's toying with himself. 
[01:27:30]  Exactly.  He's in his pants.  What's he do for work?  Is he a professional snowboarder?  He owns a snowboard company.  So he actually has a snowboard factory in Huntington Beach, California.  Nice.  That's pretty good.  Which is so amazing.  That's awesome.  Wait a minute.  California is a shithole for regulation in small business.  Like, it is impossible to have a small business there.  And it would be so easy to either have your boards made in China or go over the border and do them in Mexico.  But they have stayed not only in the U.S., but in California.  Wow.  Which makes them a punk rocker.  Good for him. 
[01:28:00]  Why are they so shitty with small businesses?  Because of the regulation and the taxes.  And now with Obamacare, Obamacare will kill small businesses.  Yeah.  Small businesses now will not have incentive to grow.  And that is absolutely true.  Obamacare will destroy this country.  Well, that's not what I hear on the news.  Oh, no.  It's wonderful.  Yay.  We should have more education, too, for everyone.  And houses and a living wage.  Unions are awesome.  Look what they did to Detroit.  It's perfect.  I love it.  Yeah.  We should have that everywhere. 
[01:28:30]  Very cool.  I love it.  Johnny Resnick from the Goo Goo Dolls wrote a number one song about me.  Which one?  Which one?  Name?  That's about you?  Yeah.  No kidding.  And I made him admit it.  I did a modern-day interview with a lot of people in the book, like Pat Spear from Nirvana,  who told me something I didn't know was that Dave Grohl started writing Foo Fighters music  long before Kirk died.  I believe that.  Oh.  Yeah.  I believe that.  And Pat told me that he was walking.  They were in the studio rehearsing. 
[01:29:00]  And he walked past Dave's car.  And Dave was playing this music, kind of jamming in his own car.  And Pat kind of surprised him.  And he turned it down and was like, whoa.  And so Pat's like, oh, that's great.  Have you written some stuff you're going to bring into the studio for all of us?  And Dave's like, no, man.  This is my new side project.  Oh, shit.  And that was Foo Fighters.  And that was before Kirk died.  So I was surprised to learn that.  The interview with Pat is really great.  And then...  Wait, I'm going to slow you down a little bit.  You met Kurt Cobain, obviously.  Yes.  What kind of guy was he?  From my point of view, a very annoyed one. 
[01:29:30]  Because I think he was one of those people who was genuinely annoyed by me.  And he actually prank called me one night.  Really?  Yeah.  But he seems like he was annoyed by everyone.  Yeah, probably.  Yeah.  I wouldn't take it personally.  But he would actively roll his eyes when I would walk in a room.  What was his problem with you?  So I was, you know...  I represented corporate music.  Oh, yeah.  Then don't do corporate music.  Well, that was the argument that Rob Tannenbaum made when they wrote their book, I Want My MTV, 
[01:30:00]  was, you know, Nirvana was a very MTV-friendly band.  It didn't feel like that from the inside, because getting them to do stuff felt like pulling teeth.  But they were all over.  But they did unplugs.  Thank you.  They did special concerts.  A lot of interviews.  Yeah, I mean, they didn't come to the beach house.  Oh, but you say, well, then don't do corporate rock.  I think he pretty much stopped doing it.  When you look at it that way, it's like, well, he pretty much took the big exit from...  He didn't puss out. 
[01:30:30]  You're right.  Yeah.  You're right.  You know what?  You're completely right.  Yeah, but he was in there for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, he was all over on TV.  They chose to make videos.  They did, and Pearl Jam did not.  After Jeremy, Pearl Jam would not make videos.  Right.  Really?  I mean, that was a band, and Pearl Jam is still one of the biggest bands in the world.  I love Pearl Jam.  Yeah.  Still a big fan.  The live show is phenomenal.  I finally got to see him for the first time, even though I've been a fan forever, in Philly  last summer.  Unbelievable.  How was the end of the show?  I snuck out.  Who needs to see Jay-Z do 99 Problems with Eddie Vedder? 
[01:31:00]  That's just sweet shit.  Get out of here.  I saw Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder do the Temple of the Dog song.  Wow.  I'm going home, Greg.  Which is, by the way, one of the worst songs ever written.  Really?  I kind of like it.  I hated that one.  Really?  Come on.  I would turn it.  Chris Cornell's shrill, shrieking.  I'm going home.  I'm going home.  Repeat that line, Chris.  I'm going home.  I'm going high like a woman who's being sexually assaulted.  Go ahead. 
[01:31:30]  Horrible.  That was an awful little tune.  So the Goo Goo Dolls, their name, how did that come about?  How did they decide to do a song?  I don't know that song.  Can we hear something?  Oh, my God.  It's like, I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's massive.  You can hide beside me, maybe for a while.  I won't tell no one your name.  I won't tell them your name.  Here we go.  Yeah. 
[01:32:00]  Wing-a-ding-a-ding-a.  I inspired this song.  Why?  Tell me the story.  Okay, so Goo Goo Dolls come to the MTV studio.  Right.  I loved their record, Superstar Car Wash.  I thought it was a great record.  They had...  That was before they hit.  Yeah.  And they had done a song with Paul Westerberg.  And there weren't.  And this was...  But a lot of people love the fucking album.  Yeah.  So I love that.  Fair enough.  I love that record.  So they came in, and I had made fun of bands in the past, and Johnny thought I was going  to make fun of them, but instead I was very effusive. 
[01:32:30]  And he was kind of caught off guard and really hot.  Like, he had these working-class Polish biceps, and he was wearing, like, a cut-off shirt and  overalls, and, you know, frosted hair, and, you know, all the ingredients right there.  So, you know, we kind of had a flirtation, and then he was like, we should go to dinner  and talk about music.  I'm like, that's a great idea.  And he was newly married.  Like, he'd only been married for, like, a year.  So he came over to my apartment, and, you know, we talked for a while.  So we went and had soup at Veselka, which is a Russian deli down the street from where 
[01:33:00]  I lived in the East Village.  And then we went back to my apartment afterward, which was, you know, always the fatal mistake.  And it's late, and it's dark, and my roommate wasn't there, and he leaned in and kissed  me.  And I was like, ha-ha.  And it was, like, a beautiful, like, life-changing electric bolts in the vagina kiss.  And I pulled back, and I was like, dude, I can't do this.  You are married.  And he's like, okay, we'll just lay down on the couch and watch TV.  And I'll rub my penis on your backside. 
[01:33:30]  We'll dry hump.  We'll dry hump.  This is a new kind of moose.  Sorry.  Let it, just rub it into your hair.  It'll make it extra shiny.  All right?  And open your mouth and close your eyes.  So we did.  Like, we just, I laid with my head in his lap on the couch, and that was, it was, like,  a really strong emotional connection that we never acted on.  And then he writes the song name.  Then he wrote the song, yeah.  Holy fuck, that's a cool story.  And they were broke before this song hit.  Like, they were going to break up, like, on food stamps broke. 
[01:34:00]  And then they got this song played, and it became huge.  And they were considered a punk band, more or less, right?  Yeah.  They were a lot harder than what.  They were from Buffalo, and it was, like, kind of punk metal.  Yeah.  And they were on Metal Blade Records.  And then when they switched to Warner Brothers.  Right.  And started writing, you know, vagina music like this.  But I always liked it.  I love, I have a total pop sensibility, and I love pop songs.  Right.  You know, that's why I thought Metallica was such a great band.  Because Metallica writes great pop songs. 
[01:34:30]  Absolutely.  And then he admitted in the book that he wrote the song about it.  That's cool, man.  Does he still imagine the same woman?  No.  He recently...  No.  No, and I actually, when...  Because you know, you go through a vetting process with a lawyer to make sure no one's  going to sue you when they read the book.  And it was funny, the stuff they flagged.  They flagged a story about Matt LeBlanc.  But with Johnny Resnick, they're like, you can't write these things.  If he was married at the time, he can sue you.  So I had to take a lot of the more explicit stuff out. 
[01:35:00]  Wow.  So.  And then there's, you know, there was a love triangle with Courtney Love and Trent Reznor.  With you?  Well, I cupped Trent's balls one night.  And that was about as far as it went.  That's...  So we were in a club on Halloween.  It wasn't.  They were lukewarm.  It was...  It almost put me off men for life.  Wow.  Like, at that point, I was like, you know what?  Maybe I am a lesbian.  I don't need this.  No.  And so I was kissing him and Richard Patrick, who was the guitarist in Nine Inch Nails,  who became the singer of Filter. 
[01:35:30]  So I was making out with both of them at a club on Halloween in the West Village.  And I really wanted to be making out with Rich, because he was a great kisser.  And so I interviewed Richard Patrick for the book, and he was like, yeah, no, I totally  wasn't into you.  Oh, man.  In the book, I was like, he could have been my first, and I loved him, and it was love  at first sight.  And he's like, yeah, no, not really.  Yeah.  Not really.  You're creepy.  You were a virgin when you started working on MTV, I guess, and your husband is your  first?  Yeah.  And your only?  Yeah.  No kidding. 
[01:36:00]  Wow.  I mean, I did other, like, showery, you know, rubbing with the soap and whatnot.  I'm right.  But you're your actual only sexual partner, for real?  Yeah.  Wow.  It's amazing.  You never hear that.  But see, I don't have any comparison.  I think it would be harder if, A, he was, you know, if he had a Twizzler wiener, and  if he was bad at it, but he's fantastic.  Oh.  And he's really hot, and he's, like, super muscular, and...  Oh, man.  Yeah, and he loves me.  He's really awesome. 
[01:36:30]  You guys have been together a long time.  Yeah, 18 years.  Wow.  Holy fuck.  That's a long time.  You mentioned Courtney Love.  We had her in.  She's awesome.  She's very sexy.  We thought we'd have a problem with her, and we ended up...  We ended up...  Oh, there's nothing like...  We ended up hitting it off.  Track marks and cigarette burns.  She was awesome.  I'm telling you.  We loved her.  She flashed me her panties, I think, by accident.  I'm not sure.  Did she just...  Farf?  No.  She tweaked her nipples.  I'm not a...  Oh, yeah.  She did some nipple tweaking.  Yeah, I don't like to...  I love that.  I'm surprised she didn't just put her foot up here and start playing, you know, her really 
[01:37:00]  crappy guitar.  But so she started sleeping with Trent Reznor, and I was really good friends with Trent before  I went to MTV.  We were friends.  And so they went on tour together, and I knew what was...  Something happens with her, and I called it her cotton candy crotch, because something  shoots out of that thing, and she snares the boys, because otherwise, men with good sense  or a penchant for other men, like, somehow they turn into just zombie Courtney lovers. 
[01:37:30]  She was pretty sexy for a while, don't you think?  No.  I thought so.  She had that skank thing going on.  She was pretty hot.  It must be a thing.  Yeah, yeah.  Her vibe is sexy.  I'd be surprised.  She's got a really good vibe.  Yeah, her vibe.  There's something about it.  Oh, no.  She's got, like, some hypnosis.  Yeah.  Like, she literally draws people in.  And so she and Trent started screwing around on the road, and he called me one day, and  I was like, get out now, and I tried to warn him, and he didn't listen, and he did such 
[01:38:00]  a dick move.  She was listening with him on the phone as I was bad-mouthing her.  Oh, wow.  That is a dick move.  And then they started, like, laughing about it, like, two 12-year-old girls, and I'm like,  you're such an ass.  Wow, that's bad.  Like, how dare you sell out our friendship, because he, of all people, found out what happens  when Courtney Love gets you in her crosshairs.  Right.  And she gave out my phone number on stage, and then she started calling me to get Trent  information when he, because he grew tired of it after two days. 
[01:38:30]  And then she put out a press release saying he had a small dick.  She put out a press release saying that he had a one-inch nail.  Not even lying.  That's how sophisticated she was.  Like, she wanted to disseminate that information as quickly as she can.  Well, you found the ball, so was there just an inch?  No, it was, there was a fine ween.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh, man, that's hilarious.  Oscar winner.  Trent Reznor, by the way.  Yes.  Academy Award winner.  That's right.  Are you still friends with him, or did that ruin the friendship? 
[01:39:00]  We are not friends.  No.  We are not friends.  It's funny, because I'm really good friends with one of the guys who used to be in his  band, and when that guy got married, I saw Trent at the wedding, and I'm like, you're such  a dick.  And he was like, I know, I'm so sorry.  Oh, I'm such a bad person.  And he's one of those people who does horrible things, and they're like, oh, I'm so sorry.  And I was like, yeah.  So finally, I got to an age where it's like, I don't want friends like that.  It's not worth it to be friends with people who just suck up all the oxygen and try and 
[01:39:30]  control the relationship.  Right on, brother.  He's got dirt.  Right on.  Yeah.  I like it.  The book, it's pretty chock full of dirt.  Dirt.  Are you friends with Ozzy?  No, but I totally would be.  Okay, good.  Jimmy is.  Jimmy loves Ozzy.  I just love Ozzy.  That's Jimmy's number one.  No, Jimmy's very good friends with Ozzy.  I'm not good friends with Ozzy.  He was a big fan for years, and then became friends.  I know him casually from here, but I know we're not good friends.  Oh, boy.  If you walked down the street and Ozzy walked by, he'd know who you are.  Yes.  Tom Yuck.  Yeah.  Talking about Radiohead, huh?  Oh, he was such a jerk.  He's an asshole, right? 
[01:40:00]  Oh, from the moment he got off the plane.  I love Radiohead music, but...  Stupid Beatle boots.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I talk about that.  The band only got better and better and better, but he was such a jerk.  He wouldn't talk.  I made fun of him incessantly, and then he decided that he hated me so much that after  our first interview, he played the MTV Beach House the first summer in 93 and was so mad  at me.  He glared at me, and he just kept staring at me. 
[01:40:30]  And so finally, I'm like, what are you looking at?  And he's like, nothing.  I'm looking at nothing.  And I'm like, ooh, Tom.  How clever.  And that pissed him off so badly that when he went on stage, he found me at the end of  the performance and just glared at the eye lasers, and then he dove into the pool.  But he was such a weenus.  He was such a lightweight, made of balsa wood, or maybe cement, that he sank with his Doc  Martin boots.  So he started sinking to the bottom of the pool, and he looks like a drowned rat with  his blonde hair and his one bad eye. 
[01:41:00]  You know, he's definitely trying to get...  His one bad eye.  He goes for the mic cable, and he was going to pull himself up with the microphone.  Oh, that's brilliant.  He would have electrocuted the 200 people in the pool, on the stage.  That would have been great.  Was that the actual, I think...  Let me see.  Yeah, that's it.  That's the...  Yeah.  So there he is.  Yeah, and he jumps in at the end of this.  He looks like a pretentious jizz bag.  And he doesn't sing Creep anymore, and I hate bands.  He doesn't sing any hit anymore. 
[01:41:30]  Not really.  Any one of their hits.  Well, that was so important.  He doesn't have to.  No, no.  What do you think his problem is?  Um, I think that...  He's misunderstood.  Is he one of those guys?  No, I think he was probably ignored as a child, never got therapy.  I'll be honest with you.  I've listened to Radio Harissa.  I tried to listen to them.  I think they're fucking terrible.  I know I'm in the minority.  I know they're geniuses.  I really don't think the new stuff is good.  I tried to listen to the old stuff.  Paranoid, Android, any of that shit.  I hate it.  And I don't want to hate it, because I know they're very popular.  The Benz is one of my favorite albums of all time. 
[01:42:00]  Yeah.  And Radiohead did that one.  That one was an amazing album.  Look at his dumb face.  Oh, yeah.  He's so mad.  He's, like, seething.  Oh, what an artist.  He's so mad at that point.  And very shortly, he's going to go in the drink.  What the fuck is...  What an asshole.  He looks like an asshole.  He does.  And people get so mad when I talk about him.  He's so important.  He's so tortured.  Looks like Kurt Cobain there, too, doesn't he?  I'm trying.  He is.  He is trying, right? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, this is 93, so Kurt was still alive.  So everyone was trying to do the Kurt thing?  Yeah.  His tortured persona is fucking stomach-turning.  Yeah, I really...  And I...  There you go.  In the pool.  All right, let me see this.  Sinks to the bottom.  He can't get out of the pool.  Drowning.  Oh, my God.  He looks like an idiot.  He's like doing the doggie paddle in the pool.  He's having a problem.  And they're showing the band and they go back to the band.  Our singer is drowning.  Oh, that's great. 
[01:43:00]  Anyone can play guitar.  Anyone can drown.  Yeah, anyone can drown.  Yeah.  Well, I think I might have to read Kennedy's book.  Fuck.  Yeah.  I don't want to read.  And we didn't even get to the Dave Navarro chapter.  Let's do it.  What do you got on Dave Navarro?  He was the last person I dated before I met my husband.  Oh.  How long did you date him?  Just a few months.  He was super sexy.  He was?  He was a heroin addict, so I wasn't going to let his fluids near me.  Oh, wow.  But he was a great kisser.  Was he?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Were you around him when he was doing the heroin? 
[01:43:30]  No.  No, he was completely sober.  He was such a workout freak, almost borderline eating disorder.  And, you know, he and I would joke a lot about our bodies and body image, and it was like  talking to my favorite gal pal, because he's very funny.  Like, he's got this wonderfully dark, twisted sense of humor, and Kurt Loder is so offended  because Dave has John Wayne Gacy paintings.  But you walk into his house, and he had a medical, like, urine specimen container with 
[01:44:00]  a dark yellow fluid, and it says Gene Hackman on it.  He's got Gene Hackman's piss.  You've got to respect that.  That's hilarious.  That's cool.  And he catches a fringe.  I like that.  Really?  Yeah.  Gene Hackman's piss.  But you went out with these guys, and they were cool not having sex with you.  Dave Navarro loved it.  Like, he loved the fact that I was not a whore, because he, at that point, felt that all  women were whores.  Right.  And if I wouldn't sleep with him, it meant that clearly I was not one of them.  Wow.  And then he was so pleased that he was the last person I dated before my husband. 
[01:44:30]  And he used to make, like, the most disparaging comments, like, how's your little aerobics  instructor?  I'm like, he's a professional snowman.  Oh, yeah.  Guys will do that.  Yeah.  So he was a good kisser, and the other guy from 90's Nails was a good kisser.  Were any of them not good?  Yeah.  Dave Perner from Soul Asylum.  He kissed me on the mouth, and I say it was like his guts punched my nose.  What do you mean?  He smelled so bad.  Oh. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah.  Bad breath.  Yeah.  Paul.  I will ruin it.  Paul.  I will ruin it.  Yeah.  I mean, when you've got coagulated beer mixed with cigarette smell.  Oh.  I remember that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  I remember that guy.  Was he the lead singer?  Yeah.  What are some of these bands doing?  They're actually back together.  I think they just put out a record, but Soul Asylum's been touring.  That was a great live band.  Like, that was one of my favorite bands from the early 90's.  Yeah.  We did a segment on our show, and people started calling up about, you know, bands and what 
[01:45:30]  they're doing now, and there's some horror stories out there.  What was the one?  Oh, the guy that's his FedEx guy.  He owns a FedEx store, and what was his hit, E-Rock?  Do you remember?  Oh, I don't.  Oh, fuck.  It was a huge song, and now he's just running a FedEx store in, like, down south, somewhere.  Look at Soul Asylum.  That's Soul Asylum?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  At least he has a nice head shape.  Jesus.  He always has that.  It's time to cut the hair, though.  Big peanutty head.  You've got to give up on the hair eventually, don't you think? 
[01:46:00]  He's got beautiful blue eyes.  Oh, well, that's nice.  And then Danny Murphy, the guy over on the right, I watched the Nirvana Unplugged sitting  next to him, and he was the only guy in the room who knew all those obscure songs.  Really?  Really?  Yes.  Which we all know now.  And everyone after the Unplugged, after they watched it, and music journalists went over  it and parsed it, like, they realized how brilliant it was.  He was the only person in the room who was like, holy shit, they're doing a Vaseline's  cover right now.  I'm like, what are Vaseline's?  And, you know, there was a lot of stuff that was, you know. 
[01:46:30]  Oh, you were at that taping?  Yeah.  So that was, was that done on 53rd Street or something in the old Sony studio?  Oh, it was, right.  Okay.  Very good.  That was a tape tough crowd.  That's why they said that was taped there.  That's one of my favorite things ever, the Unplugged.  Yeah.  That was awesome.  How was it being there?  You got any inside dirt on that whole thing?  It was so fun, because I took a male model.  Jesus.  I took this guy, Jeffrey, because, like, all of my counterparts were dating female models.  So I was like, I'm going to start dating models.  And then I realized, dumb, but this guy, this guy wasn't. 
[01:47:00]  Like, he was, he was sweet and smart, and we never had a physical relationship, but I  took him to Nirvana, and it was so strange, because as I was writing that chapter, he found  me on Facebook the next day and was like, remember when you took me to Nirvana Unplugged?  And I called him, and he brought back all these memories, and, like, Kate Moss was there,  and we were sitting on, you know, steamer trunks, and I was like, do you put supermodel on  your tax return?  She said, no, I put modu. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, God.  She goes, why would you put on your tax return?  I said, modu.  All right.  Good comeback.  Good comeback.  But no inside dirt?  I mean, Kurt was pretty fucked up at that point, right?  Yeah.  He wasn't then, and I asked Pat about that, if at the Unplugged taping, but what happened  was, after the show, I mean, it was great, said it was beautiful, and actually, Dave Grohl  does such an amazing performance during that, and you realize, like, the fact that he could  play drums and sing so beautifully and harmonize all at the same time, and he's a great guitarist, 
[01:48:00]  kind of unfair, but, you know, you're watching this, and it's theatrical, and it's really  beautiful.  They walk offstage, and we had to sit there for, like, an hour and a half while they went  over the footage.  So they essentially watched the whole thing, and MTV was begging them to do, you know,  just, like, one of the hits, and Dave and Chris were up for it.  They were like, yeah, sure, we'll totally go back out, and Kurt was like, no, there's  no way I will ever be able to top...  What just happened.  Yeah, and what was it?  Lead Belly?  Yeah.  Where Did You Sleep? 
[01:48:30]  Where Did You Sleep?  That's an amazing song, which I did not know about at the time.  Neither did I.  And that version is ridiculous.  It's one of my favorite songs of all time.  Well, that's like, that Nirvana Unplugged was so special and amazing.  And you knew it was really good there.  Like, it sounded just awesome, and it was exactly what they wanted, but the network  was desperate for them to do.  Oh, I bet.  So you think he was smart not to, though, in hindsight?  I think he should have let everyone go in hindsight.  Like, he knew right then and there.  There was a couple of hits in there, though.  Yeah, yeah.  But what were they looking for?  What hit? 
[01:49:00]  Smells Like Teen Spirit, probably?  No, they didn't want Smells Like Teen Spirit.  I think...  I'm trying to remember.  I think they wanted lithium.  It's in the book because...  Because they've got to come as you are.  You know what, though?  Oh, yeah, okay.  But all those became very big after this.  But where did you sleep last night?  And that's how it ends.  When he opens his eyes at the end of that song.  Yes, and that scream.  Holy fuck.  I mean, it's like...  That came from a place.  Yes, and then you realize what he was tortured by.  I felt that. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  I was like, okay, I get it now.  Yeah, that came from a deep place.  And it's so funny because when Nirvana hit...  And I also interviewed Matt Cameron from Soundgarden in the book.  And I asked him if it was intentional that Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden all release their records within six weeks of each other.  And I asked him, you know, did you guys do that on purpose?  And he said, no.  And he said, in fact, he had listened to a bunch of the Pearl Jam stuff.  And he thought it was good.  And he was really happy for Stone and Jeff because they were in Mother Love Bone.  And, you know, they were a really, really tight scene in Seattle before that. 
[01:50:00]  So he was happy that they found a singer and had moved on.  But he said when he heard that Pearl Jam record, it gave him chills.  And he knew that was going to be huge.  And, I mean, I argue that that was the point in music that completely shifted away from metal.  And I, you know, I still do music radio.  I have not seen anything like that since.  So it was Pearl Jam.  No, I think it was Nirvana.  Oh, yeah.  Well, what do you mean about the Pearl Jam record?  I lost you there for a second.  No, Matt Cameron was just saying, who was in Soundgarden, and he's in Pearl Jam now. 
[01:50:30]  Right.  And he was saying, you know, even given that, Pearl Jam was good, but it was nothing like Nirvana.  Okay, I got you.  He said Nirvana was so incredible that it gave him chills when he listened to it.  He listened to some of the rough tracks in the studio because they were working with the same producer.  Right.  And he was blown away.  Yeah, music made a hard fucking left turn after that.  Yeah.  It was just like...  Goodbye, hair bands.  Bye-bye.  Yeah, just a massive shift.  Nirvana later.  And that's what happened.  I know it happened.  So, Janie Lane walked into Donnie.  Yeah, it's a famous story.  Oh, that story's great.  And was it an Alice in Chains poster?  Yes, it was. 
[01:51:00]  And he was like, what?  He goes, what the fuck?  This is my fucking joint.  Uh, not anymore.  Then he moved on.  It used to be a warrant poster right above the secretary's or the receptionist's desk.  And then he came in one day and it was an Alice in Chains poster.  And he knew, oh boy, we're in trouble.  It's over.  That whole hair band thing was huge, obviously.  And that happened at MTV in 97.  I went into one of the music executives' office and she had a huge Spice Girls picture.  And I'm like, what are Spice Girls?  And she's like, they're great. 
[01:51:30]  They're going to be huge.  I'm like, I hope not.  Yeah, well, they were.  So it did happen to you.  Well, it did, yeah, because that pop shift, I don't think I would have survived that pop  shift because it was, it was in 97, it was that year, they canceled Alternative Nation  and TRL launched.  And that's when Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, that's when  they all hit.  Popped.  Yeah, you jumping around to that shit would have been a little weird.  Oh, it would have been so inauthentic.  I would have been miserable.  So in hindsight, you left at the right time.  Yeah, it was, for me, it was, it was right. 
[01:52:00]  And I know my husband's happy.  Nice.  Dave.  Kennedy, you got to come back and see us.  Great story.  This was so much fun.  I really appreciate it.  And I think we did book you.  I think there was a weird misunderstanding, just so you know.  We wanted you on the show.  Well, I'm glad to be here.  Yeah, okay.  Truly.  Kennedy Chronicles, it's called.  There's a very sexy photo of you on some sort of animal.  A mule.  A large dog.  A mule.  That's actually a cobra.  That's a cobra.  Dangerous. 
[01:52:30]  And, yeah, I'm actually going to read this.  I wish we had known in further advance your comics.  I would love to have read it before.  Oh, good.  Well, we'll hopefully see you on Red Eye.  And we can discuss over.  All right.  You do Red Eye.  We haven't done it together, though.  Yeah, we did.  Did we?  Yeah, we did.  I don't remember.  I remember you.  You were really funny.  I never did.  We argued about some point.  And you were very funny.  And you kind of shook your head and you were annoyed.  And then you punctuated it with a great joke.  I actually do remember that.  Yes, I do remember you.  I remember the chair you were sitting in. 
[01:53:00]  It wasn't a terrible argument.  And I forget what it was that we were debating.  Do you remember?  No.  Probably some NSA, IRS, this or that.  Something light and trifling.  I'm just sure Jimmy took the fucking left-wing lib fucking.  Let's go to Berkeley and braid your vagina hair.  You're forgetting the most important band, Alice in Chains.  Yeah.  I love Alice in Chains.  Anne's a huge Alice in Chains fan, too.  Yeah.  Who doesn't?  That's a tragic story.  That unplugged was great, too. 
[01:53:30]  It really was.  They didn't find Lane Staley for weeks.  Yeah.  He bailed on everybody.  What kind of?  Yeah.  He showed everyone out.  No pals there to find him.  They figured he was there for well over a week, two weeks or something like that.  That poor bastard.  Did he help?  No.  I never know.  He played an MTV event early on when I was there that I was not allowed to attend.  Oh.  But then I remember interviewing Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney at the Beach House, and they  were hysterical.  They actually wore old-timey-time full-body bathing suits from the early 19s. 
[01:54:00]  And they painted their faces sunburned with white around their eyes as though they had been  wearing sunglasses and were fried in the sun.  They were so funny and amazing.  And I was like, why don't you guys go on tour?  And Sean Kinney's like, my lead singer's a health freak.  But he was, you know, obviously.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He was kind of being sarcastic.  Yeah.  But they, you know, Jerry has a beautiful voice, and they've got that together.  Oh, Jerry can harmonize.  He's unbelievable. 
[01:54:30]  But Lane Staley's voice, holy fuck.  That was amazing.  Now, who started doing the Eddie Vedder thing before Lane Staley?  Because you know the...  And then that horrible Scott staff from Creed did it.  Oh, yeah.  And don't forget Silverchair.  They did a little bit of that, too, right?  Oh, yeah.  They were, like, 14-year-old Australians.  You can't play.  We got them beers.  They played one of our gigs in Boston.  We got them beers. 
[01:55:00]  They were, like, 16 at the time, 17.  Oh, thanks, mate.  This is great.  We also did it with Day of the New.  They needed some beers.  Oh, that's right.  We got them beers.  I hate that style of singing, too.  It drives me crazy.  I love that.  It's so affected.  Oh, it makes me sick.  But Eddie changed it up a little bit.  Yeah, he did.  And when he did his solo record with the ukulele, he didn't...  You know what it sounds like?  It sounds like James going...  Yeah, that's what it sounds like. 
[01:55:30]  She was a large girl.  Yeah, she was a big girl shirt.  Help me get this in the truck.  Would you?  Yeah.  A band that I loved was Mother Love Bone.  I love Mother Love Bone.  They should have hit, obviously, and the guy from, you know, Dropstead of...  Oh, I loved Andrew Wood's voice.  Andrew Wood, of course.  I loved his voice.  But he was kind of metal.  Like, he was that...  They were not grunge.  It was sort of the bridge between the two genres, right?  Yes.  Because it was like metals meeting the, you know...  Yeah, and they were like glam and would wear makeup and had big hair, but... 
[01:56:00]  You could hear Guns N' Roses in there, but you could also hear, you know, some of the  fucking grunge rock as well.  I really liked that band a lot.  Them and Green River, which was like a super group.  I don't know Green River too much.  I know the name, but I don't know their shit.  Yeah, that was Mark Arm and Stone and...  Right.  I just don't know their stuff.  I've heard the name a million times.  I should, like, go search it out a bit.  Anyway, we could talk forever.  Kennedy, thank you so much.  Thank you, guys.  Come back and see us.  You have a show to do, and I wish you luck.  Yes.  Luck at this point.  Jesus.  We were discussing Rodman, Eric just told me, on North Korea. 
[01:56:30]  We were talking about Dennis Rodman.  Oh, really?  Look into his face.  Dennis?  No one talks about, like, something is wrong with his face.  It looks like he's been in a radiation accident and wears, like, an inch of old lady makeup  to cover it.  Yes.  There's something going on with him.  Oh, really?  And maybe it's the rampant alcoholism that's well documented.  Well, that could be it.  Yeah.  He loves his booze.  He loves it.  All right, guys.  He's all right.  You're great.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The book is called The Kennedy Chronicles.  It's out now. 
[01:57:00]  Go get it.  That's it.  Yes.  Or you can buy it on Kindle if you want to.  Kindle, Amazon.  Kindle.  You guys can even link to the Amazon page on your website.  I don't even mind.  Wow.  That would be crazy.  Don't even be mad.  E-Rock, just link her book on our Facebook page.  Yeah, come on, E-Rock.  What's wrong with you?  Thank you, E-Rock.  The OPNF3 Show.  On SiriusXM.  SiriusXM. 
[01:57:30]  The OPNF3 Show.  I'm Lord Hungry I'm Lord Hungry  I'm Lord Hungry  I'm Lord Hungry  I'm going hungry, I'm going hungry, I'm going hungry.  I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, for Kennedy, I know you're out there somewhere, Kennedy. 
[01:58:00]  This one's for you.  This one's for you. 
[01:58:30]  You know what?  You know what?  You got a good voice.  Yeah.  You know what's so odd?  It's such like how fucking, how the little world works.  My sister is, you know, she's like a fucking regional manager of some fucking clothing shit that she does, whatever.  Useless fucking job.  No, I'm teasing, of course.  I love my sister.  That's her thing. 
[01:59:00]  That's her thing.  She's done very, very well over the years.  She works with Dennis Falcone's daughter.  No kidding.  How the fuck does that happen?  Isn't that weird?  She just discovered this?  Yeah, they just figured it out.  Sal's been talking.  Every time Sal sees Dennis, he talks about wanting to fuck his daughter.  Oh, Jesus.  It's a big coincidence there.  Well, now there's an in.  What?  Sal wants to?  Yeah, he does.  Oh, does Dennis have pretty daughters?  How old are they?  My daughter alone because she's a civilian, Jesus Christ. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, I'd be okay with that.  It's okay.  Or, or at least ask the father.  Well, I think it's, um, all right.  Hiya.  Sal doesn't want to fuck anything that has a vagina.  We all know that by now.  At least you don't have to worry about pregnancy.  He can't seem to fucking orgasm or.  Somewhere.  Where's Dennis, uh, Falcone?  Dennis Falcone.  We wanted him on the second day in Montreal just to see how we were doing.  Yeah.  With the, uh.  Maybe we could get a little review of our Kennedy interview from him.  Oh.  That's why I do it right there. 
[02:00:00]  Jesus.  That's why.  He's on his way up.  Is he?  Come right in.  This is why I do it.  I gave up on Boba until I realized that it really bothered Jimmy.  And then for some twisted fucking reason, I, I was back in.  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just to see Jimmy's face when he knows Bobo's on the line.  Boo boo.  Yeah.  Isn't that kind of weird though?  You're just like.  That is weird.  It's a giant fucking, giant nation we live in.  There it is.  What are we losing our, uh, losing our interns soon, huh? 
[02:00:30]  Tomorrow we lose, uh, Sydney.  Sydney's gone tomorrow.  Sydney's in my last day together.  And she's writing about that on a Facebook.  Tear stricken.  Aw.  Tear stricken.  It's titled tear stricken.  Oh, here's Dennis Falcone.  Oh.  He's right at the door.  Isn't Nick DiPaolo calling in today?  Nick?  No.  He was gonna.  I don't know.  What happened?  Okay.  Might have Nick on.  Hey.  There he is.  Oh wait, here's your, uh, walk on music. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  And how I got the job as an FM jock.  The day you married me.  Uh.  It was two kids and I was into AM rock.  Oh yeah.  But I just had to run around.  Hi Dennis.  Hello Jim, how are you?  You like this song Dennis?  Yeah, good song.  Yeah.  Did you hear our interview with Kennedy?  Yes, that was good.  Terrific, right?  Oh, good.  Did we ask all the, uh, pertinent questions?  She didn't seem as wild as, uh, her persona.  I know, right? 
[02:01:30]  That surprised me.  Took me aback a little bit.  She was a great talker though.  Like a really funny.  Some people are just really interesting to listen to.  Yeah.  And she was really interesting to listen to.  Absolutely.  Yes.  And, uh, how do we do with the, the music tie in?  She was, you know, talked about a little music.  That's always good.  We could have done some kind of, uh, talk about some of the stations here.  Like, oh, she's, she talks about something in the nineties.  We could have been like, well, you could hear that on, you know, lithium.  You know, lithium.  You did a great job.  Yeah, I should have done that.  You did a great job.  I should have plugged lithium. 
[02:02:00]  You should have.  When she said lithium, the song.  She said the song lithium.  Hey, and by the way, we have a station right here.  But he means that.  Oh, I know.  I know he does.  Yeah, you really shut up.  You missed your tie-in.  You missed your tie-in to the company you work for.  Are you going out to sing karaoke with your sister tonight?  Uh, I hear there's a big karaoke thing going on tonight, yeah.  I was showing my daughter the vine.  Uh-huh.  I said, oh, this is, you know, Anthony's place.  And, uh, she goes, wait a second.  I know that girl.  And she said, she goes, that's, you know, and she works with her. 
[02:02:30]  I said, what?  I said, yeah.  I said, well, I'll ask Anthony how he knows this girl.  Yeah.  So then she texted me the next day.  She goes, it's his sister.  Sister, yeah.  And then I guess they were.  She wants karaoke.  I guess they were out last night or something.  What, they hang out?  Or maybe, no, like it was a company thing.  Oh, okay.  She put together a karaoke thing.  I said one.  Yeah, let me see.  It says, I'm out with some work peeps doing charity karaoke.  One of my managers from one of the stores proceeds to tell me that her dad works with you at Sirius. 
[02:03:00]  I was like, who's your dad?  She said, Dennis Falcone.  That's weird.  That's funny.  It's a small world.  Very small world.  It really is.  It gets smaller all the time.  You never know, so you never want to burn a bridge.  See?  Yeah, that's good advice.  Very sage advice.  Yes.  By the way, you guys did a great job in Canada last week.  Oh, the Montreal shows.  Those weren't good, right?  It was really good.  I think we have a highlight podcast. 
[02:03:30]  Yes, it went up yesterday.  It went up yesterday.  So if you missed our Montreal shows, we got a quick Open Anthony podcast.  An hour.  Hour of the highlights from the Montreal trip.  That's good.  And some very funny comics that were on for the first time.  Very funny.  You got the midget?  I think he made it, yes.  Brad Williams.  I think John Mulaney.  John Mulaney was hilarious.  Everyone was great.  Everyone.  Stefano from day two.  That was good.  I think when they rebuild your studio, you should have it set up like with the couch. 
[02:04:00]  The couch worked very well.  They're not rebuilding anything.  They kind of got rid of an old phone.  That's good.  There's a step in the right direction.  The monitor got pushed down there.  Yeah, the monitor just pushed down.  And then I was told it's a work in progress.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Eric just told me where the old phone is.  Where?  They shoved it in Eric's studio.  It's right next to his feet.  Oh, good.  Oh, boy.  Whatever works.  It's great to kick his feet on it. 
[02:04:30]  Falcone.  Yes, sir.  I want to ask you about Anthony Weiner.  I know you don't work blue, but how would you handle that on your radio show?  Yeah, would you talk about the fact that he's got all these cock pictures popping up?  Right.  He shouldn't be doing that if he wants to run for office.  Well.  Well, they all do it.  Sound advice.  Words of wisdom.  Yeah.  He shouldn't be working blue either.  I don't think he's going to get the nod.  Huh?  I don't think he's going to get the nod.  Of course not.  No, I don't think so either.  He can't have a mayor coming five times a day.  I do enjoy that little fight, though, going on between one of his interns. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, fuck.  We blew that off.  The assistant that he had working with him, who apparently are both kind of attractive.  I think.  I think they both were, but they're slinging some mud, talking about calling them a fucking  C word.  I don't want to say what Dennis is here.  And a whore or a slut.  Do you know what the C word is, Dennis?  Oh, yeah.  You do?  I don't like that word.  It's a great one. 
[02:05:30]  Love it.  I would be playing the Oscar Mayer Wiener jingle all the time.  Ah, well.  The kids marching and stuff.  Oh, I wish there was an Oscar Mayer.  Hey, another Anthony Wiener story in the news.  And whenever you talk about them, that comes up.  I wish there was.  Yes.  What are some of the great dick songs of all time?  Sort of like the Quack Quack.  Let me see.  Dick songs.  Oh.  That's not blue, because they were actual songs.  You know, with that double entendre and shit.  Well, there was.  Well, remember Shaving Cream?  Shaving Cream? 
[02:06:00]  Buddy Bell?  No.  It was a double entendre.  Shave Every...  Yeah.  Was it a big hit?  Yeah.  And you sang Entendre.  You're one of those guys?  There he goes.  Yeah.  I have a sad story to tell you.  What is this?  It may hurt your feelings a bit.  Oh.  Last night when I walked into my bathroom, I stepped in a big pile of shaving cream.  Oh, it's one of these songs.  Be nice and clean.  Be nice and clean.  Shave every day and you'll always lose me. 
[02:06:30]  It's like my ding-a-ling Chuck Berry.  I thought he was going to say shit.  Yeah.  Right.  See?  The double entendre.  Entendre.  One more.  Her antics are queer, I'll admit.  Each time I say darling, I love you.  She tells me that I'm full of shaving cream.  This is alright.  Be nice and clean.  What year is this?  Shave every day and you'll always lose me.  You know who kept his style going, Anthony? 
[02:07:00]  Who?  He could have been managed by the same guy.  Red Peter.  Red Peter.  How's your whole family?  Suck on a stiff cocktail with me.  Scorch loved that song.  Here it is.  Every Friday.  How's your whole...  What?  Family.  Oh, okay.  Oof.  Oh, wow.  I could have worked a lot.  Yes.  Family.  How's your whole family?  Family. 
[02:07:30]  How is your whole family?  Novelty song.  Yes, exactly.  How's your whole family?  Maybe a Dr. Demento song.  Right.  Right.  Do you like this, Sam?  We're getting flashbacks to Syracuse.  You think it's funny?  We played it.  A lot?  At AF we played it.  We thought we were funny playing this.  How's your whole family?  How's your whole family?  This was one of our Friday songs.  We played a lot, actually, for a while.  Funny Friday?  Is that what you called it?  Oh.  How's your dick?  What?  Dick?  But he goes with dictation?  Dictation machine.  That's a stretch. 
[02:08:00]  What the fuck is that?  Well, like in the 90s, these songs were big.  People liked this stuff.  It was a dictation machine.  Exactly.  How's your der-id-jable?  How's your der-id-jable?  How's your der-id-jable?  How's your der-id-jable?  How's your der-id-jable?  How's your der-id-jable?  Take your pants down.  Take your pants down.  Yeah.  To the cleaners today.  See?  I got it.  Yeah.  Musical interlude.  Fuck a kid.  Kinda cute.  Not victim.  But that's just as bad. 
[02:08:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh, not actually do his ass.  Oh, wow.  Astrological charge.  That would get us in trouble with the FCC.  Bite my clit.  Taurus, you cunt.  I know.  I think you're missing the gist of how this works, Jimmy. 
[02:09:00]  They might play this on blue-collar comedies.  Good for them.  They would play this.  I don't even know what blue-collar comedy is.  I have no idea.  Never listen to it.  It's funny.  Why?  They have a lot of Jeff Foxworthy on there.  Very good.  Larry the Cable Guy.  He has a big finish.  What?  No.  I guess we don't get it.  Family.  Tell me how's that great big hole.  Ah, that great big hole.  Yeah. 
[02:09:30]  Come on.  Dennis Howard.  Family.  One of the greatest dick songs of all time.  How is your hole.  I really didn't do any show prep on this, but if I knew that was the topic.  What about stroking?  Is that a dick song?  Is that one of the big dick songs of all time?  I guess so.  I guess so.  Stroke me?  Stroking by Clarence Carter.  Oh.  What about stroke me?  Stroke me?  Stroke me?  That's one of the great dick songs of all time.  Stroking.  That's a good one.  What about squeeze my lemon and make the juice go down my leg? 
[02:10:00]  Squeeze box.  All right.  Squeeze box.  I guess it was a couple of things.  Suck on my big ten inch.  Yeah.  That's one of the greatest dick songs of all time.  Yeah.  Possibly the greatest.  Oh, suck on my big ten inch.  Yeah.  Fucking Pekka.  No.  Chip.  Chip doesn't get it either.  Kind of missing the point.  You know.  It's got to be subtle.  It's got to be subtle.  It's got to be subtle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good, right?  No, not really.  No, Chip isn't very good.  Big Balls ACDC. 
[02:10:30]  There you go.  One of the great dick songs of all time.  Yes, yes.  Detachable penis.  Detachable penis.  Detachable penis, yes.  What's wrong with you, Dennis?  You should know this shit.  Okay.  Well, he's got it up on the screen here.  It's not that he's coming off the top of his head.  But you're more of an oldies guy.  It's got to be old.  I said my ding-a-ling before.  My ding-a-ling.  It's sad that that was his only number one song, too.  And it stinks.  He liked to get shit on, right?  I hate my ding-a-ling.  Ding-a-ling guy.  I heard he used to lay under a coffee table and fucking chicks would drop deuces on the top of it.  You know that, right, Dennis?  You just don't want to talk about it, right?  I have no idea what you're talking about. 
[02:11:00]  You've heard the rumors.  He'd lay under the table and the girl would take a big shaving cream.  Fuck it.  Awful.  Jimmy laughs at glass tables, by the way.  Yeah.  That's child's play.  Yeah, for what?  Glass table.  What do you play?  Have a cat with a fucking football helmet on?  Man up.  Man up.  Shaving cream.  I'm going to think of it all day.  Shaving cream.  It's a funny song.  It stays with me.  It does stay with me.  Fill my cunt with shaving cream. 
[02:11:30]  I always feel like I need a shower after I leave.  Ah, yes.  Y-Rock told me that was a big Morning Zoo song.  I never heard that one before in my life.  Really?  With shaving cream?  You've heard it before?  Never.  Okay.  Never.  I never did.  Shaving cream.  I'm sure Y-Rock also remembers Eugene.  Remember that one?  Remember Eugene?  Yes, Dennis.  In actual list, it's the top ten dick songs of all time.  What do we got on the list there, Sam Roberts?  Well, Big Balls was said.  Is that number one? 
[02:12:00]  Yeah.  I don't know if it's in any specific order.  Oh, they can't commit to one order?  Top ten penis songs.  I'm down here.  Hot Dog and a Shake by David Lee Roth.  Really?  Monster by Fred Schneider.  What?  God.  Monster in my pants and it does a little dance, that's all.  I don't know that one.  We should hear it.  That's all.  That's all.  That's all.  Yeah.  Can I hear it?  There's a monster in my pants but it's not as big as ants.  Whack it off.  This is it?  Yeah?  Yeah. 
[02:12:30]  This is a big old turn of the song.  Oh, this sounds very 80s.  Yeah.  A little Miami Vice.  Yes.  You can picture driving.  I'm trying to play this on First Wave here with SiriusXX.  Ah, good for that.  Ah.  There's a fuck.  I don't know what First Wave is.  This is soundtrack to bad 80s sitcom, action show.  Action, yeah.  Yeah.  Hart Castle and McCormick.  Yeah.  Cagney and Lacey.  Yeah. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  You know.  Cagney has to go.  She has an eight ball stuck in her twat.  She's doing the emergency room.  There's a monster in my pants and it does a nasty dance.  Sounds like B-52s a little bit.  Yeah.  A little bit.  Oh, it is the guy.  Yeah.  T-Rock has to tell me it's the guy.  I didn't know.  I love Shaq.  Baby.  Monster.  Monster.  Oh, it's B-52s.  It's the B-52s.  I don't know.  I don't give a fuck.  This was one of his solo efforts.  Good for him. 
[02:13:30]  With the rest of the B-52s.  Right.  So it's B-52s.  Right.  Yeah.  What else is on the couch?  Today, by the way, the Opie and Anthony show, I'm doing a solo show today.  Okay.  This is the Anthony show.  Your solo project.  Yeah.  We're all hanging out.  Right.  And doing the same exact thing.  Exactly.  But it's my solo show.  Pop his assholes.  Fucking bullshit.  Like those four solo Kiss albums.  Oh shit.  Now you're fucking trouble.  All released on the same day with the same cover.  That was actually brilliant.  Yeah.  You like that?  Yeah.  Because it was still done as a band. 
[02:14:00]  Who had the weakest album?  Gene.  I wait.  Gene Simmons, right?  A lot of people say that.  Aces, I think, was the best.  What song did Aces have on it?  New York Groove.  Oh, okay.  Right there is worth the price of admission.  Oh, wait.  What was the one he fucking opened with?  Oh, my God.  And Peter Criss had Beth, right?  No, that was off Destroyer.  Oh.  Peter Criss's...  That was a group effort.  Oh.  No, it wasn't.  How dare you?  Well, we had Peter Criss in.  He'll tell you it wasn't a fucking group effort. 
[02:14:30]  And Gene tries to take a little credit for that song because it...  Right.  He called it...  What was the name of the song originally?  Beck.  Beck.  Oh, yeah.  Instead of Beth.  Gene had to go, I just made a little correction on the song and said, you should call it Beth.  And it became a huge hit.  And it became a huge hit because of me.  And apparently, like, people have called him a lying sack of shit after that.  Yeah.  We're passing on them, right?  I hope not.  I'll take them to the boneyard.  Oh.  Gene and Paul.  I saw...  Oh, no.  You got many radio shows they could go on.  What? 
[02:15:00]  The After Show.  Yeah.  Jimmy's Boneyard show.  I know there's one they won't go on.  What?  In the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, they said no to us?  No, no, no.  That's you guys.  You guys don't like Kiss?  Yeah, I love you.  I...  Look it up!  Look it up!  I think when Gene had a problem with Danny typing too hard was the day I turned on Gene Simmons.  So probably the only song Jimmy doesn't like is I Was Made For Lovin' You, right?  Yeah, I felt Dynasty.  That was okay.  You don't like that?  The disco, fuckin' disco kiss?  I don't mind it. 
[02:15:30]  Fuckin' 2000 Man came off of that, which is a fuckin' kind of a cover-up song.  I was made for lovin' you.  That was like disco.  Yeah.  Alright, what about the dick songs?  What about Penis Song by Monty Python?  What?  Penis Song.  How's that good?  Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.  Here's a little number I tossed off recently in the Caribbean.  Doesn't it awfully nice to have a penis?  Isn't it rightfully good to have a penis?  Enough.  But that's not a double entendre.  Well, he's singing that in a lounge.  He's playing piano in a very fine establishment. 
[02:16:00]  Yeah, I never got it.  I fuckin' hated Monty Python.  Monty Python, really?  Yeah.  There was a couple good skits, but...  Love Gun, Kiss.  Oh, Love Gun.  Love Gun, Jimmy.  You should've came up with Love Gun.  Yeah, I didn't miss that one.  I didn't think of it.  You pulled the trigger of My Love Gun.  Yeah.  What else?  My Wiena by Bowling Fur Soup.  Alright.  Pink Thing, XTC.  He's My Best Friend by Jellyfish.  What? 
[02:16:30]  Wow.  Sledgehammer, Peter Gabriel.  Oh.  How about they go with songs most people know of?  Well, yeah, that's what happens when you drink.  Sledgehammer.  Sledgehammer we know, obviously.  Yeah.  It's a hit.  Of course, Detachable Penis was named.  Yeah.  That's it.  Although I'm seeing that Macklemore has a song called Penis Song.  Macklemore?  Yeah.  Get Macklemore in here.  Like a 50's character.  Get Macklemore in here now.  I love this guy again. 
[02:17:00]  I love you.  Macklemore!  In my office!  There you go.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I think you're right.  God, I want to just take you home as a pet.  You guys are really entertaining.  It was really entertaining.  Thank you very much for all your...  Can't lose the Macklemore account.  Yeah, yeah.  It is very...  Yeah, I like it.  Anything else, Dennis?  Or Denny?  No.  Wherever the hell you go by.  Whatever.  Hey, I'm, again, just a blast hanging out with you guys.  What are you doing today?  I see no clipboard.  Working, doing some music logs, doing some programming.  Those music logs. 
[02:17:30]  They're really important.  They love logging that music.  That music really changes.  That's what Chuck Berry liked in his face.  Chuck Berry liked his face.  Actually getting a jump on the Christmas music.  You know, just want to get ahead of things.  What?  Yeah, you know, just...  That's crazy.  How does the Christmas music change from year to year?  Can't you just grab the playlist from...  The same shit.  Yeah, exactly.  I want to make sure we're playing the biggest version,  so when we're ready to go on that...  When we're ready to go on that?  More advanced planning than anything else that goes on in this place. 
[02:18:00]  Have you ever advanced planned for this radio show?  Oh, my God.  No.  A pretty good hour was a surprise to me.  Hey, a surprise to everybody.  I came in here really tired.  I'm like, oh, fuck, man.  And then we ended up having a pretty good hour.  But we didn't know we were going to talk about that shit.  And he's, you know, Christmas.  Planning ahead.  Planning Christmas music.  Well, it's like I'm on Sunday nights on the 60s on 6.  Right.  And if there's stuff, I'll, you know, during the week,  I'll just put some short prep together.  Just not roasting on an open fire.  I remember, you're playing the same music basically all the time on the Decades channel. 
[02:18:30]  And so you have to come up with different stuff.  You just can't say that's the Rolling Stones.  Well, yeah.  No kidding, it's the Rolling Stones.  But, you know, come up with something different about Under My Thumb.  You know, like, I think two weeks ago, Keith Richards says he'd like to tour again in another 10 years.  You know, he was doing an interview.  And I said, can you imagine, well, they'll be 80 then, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It was just 70.  Right.  And then what happened?  That was the whole break?  Well, yeah, because I had an 18 second.  You just did a math equation?  A math equation?  Well, no.  You did a math equation?  By the way, he was on, you know, so and so.  70 plus 10 is 80.  Here's Under My Thumb. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah, 18 second ramp on that.  So if you miss them now, they'll have a 60th reunion in 10 years.  There's a great version of Under My Thumb, a live version from some show that they used to do, a TV show.  It's so, can you, it's a fucking Top of the Pops or something?  Yeah, it was one of those.  And Mick Jagger, he looks like every alternative guy today.  It was in that documentary that was out recently.  I know what you're talking about.  Hullabaloo.  That's a great scene.  They were really young.  Yeah.  And Mick, it's a really weird version, but he's just doing this weird little, it's black and white, of course. 
[02:19:30]  Did you ever hear the version of that song by The Who?  On Odds and Sodds?  Yeah, they did that.  Because remember there was a time when the Rolling Stones weren't allowed to record or something.  And The Who did a great version of that song.  Wow.  As a matter of fact, we played it last week on the-  Is that Martha Quinn?  Now it's the fantastic Rolling Stones.  Yeah.  This is awesome.  Jimmy's right.  It looks like having a hipster today.  It wants to look like Mick Jagger.  Oh my god.  This is so-  Under my thumb, the girl who once had me down. 
[02:20:00]  What a weird guy.  No lipstick in there.  No lipstick in there.  The girl who once had me around.  I just saw him in the gym.  This was Ready Steady Go?  Is that a me?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  The way she's always just going to move down to me.  It's like doing some weird thing.  He was the fucking coolest, man.  But now he looks just weird.  He's a bad dude, man.  Look at the girls.  Wow, she's fainting. 
[02:20:30]  She's fainting.  Should've fucked her.  Ugh!  Could've fucked him!  This chick's fucking drugged up.  They all look like they're in their, like, early thirties.  And they're, like, thirteen.  Look at this chick is losing her fucking mind.  the xylophone 
[02:21:00]  whoever knew  the Stones  I was the xylophone player for the Stones for a little while  and the song still sounds good  after all these years  it stands up  you can't not like this  you can't watch this and not think  he's the coolest guy on the planet  absolutely  that's good  but now he doesn't say me anymore 
[02:21:30]  me  me  me  me  me  me  me  me  me  me  me  is he the best dancer ever though?  look at his dance  it's the greatest dancer ever  everyone imitated him  it's like a little peepee dance  Chris Robinson completely stole his moves  oh really?  oh god yeah  is that a me?  me  oh my god 
[02:22:00]  he doesn't say two anymore either  how many loads  has come out of that cock  since this was recorded  on strange girls  they wanted to wear the black hat  they were like moshing almost in that pitch  and they were more middle class than the Beatles were the poor ones  Keith Richards explained it  he goes we want to wear the black hat 
[02:22:30]  we let the Beatles have the white hat  look at the audience  the guys wearing suits  suits and ties  like you went out and put a tie on  that's crazy  if you ask Dennis  he wishes we'd go back to that  right Dennis?  I always enjoyed wearing a shirt and tie to the office  which ones were the mobs?  as a broadcast professional I think it's uh  you know  have you done radio shows with a tie on?  I would loosen it up  I would open up the top button  I would wear a suit to the office  back to the future  that's fucking pretty badass 
[02:23:00]  I tell you  it didn't get much better than that  1966  good stuff  you know it's a great song  I also played that on Sunday night  the flip side of Painted Black  Stupid Girl  another good Rolling Stones song  yeah  a lot of good B-side hits  you'd buy a 45 back in the 60s or 70s  and you'd flip it over  and you'd say  wow this is a great song  I would usually be like 
[02:23:30]  I'm never gonna play this other side of the record  I need the hit  right  well back then you had double-sided hits  you had  Beatles had double-sided hits  Beatles had double-sided hits  a lot of the B-sides were a waste of time  let's be honest with each other  later on  later on  hey hey what can I do by Led Zeppelin  was a B-side  okay  yes it was  very good  which one's this?  see I know my show  yes you do  I know a little shit  you know a lot of stuff  not as much  no you know a lot of stuff  sounds like the monkeys 
[02:24:00]  well I think the monkeys might have copied that  oh  good record  I'm not feeling this one  no?  no  however  so you wouldn't have flipped it over  nope  did you ever see them on Ed Sullivan  the dude  As Tears Go By  oh yeah?  yeah  that's fucking great  that's Sully Stone  I didn't know you liked the Stones Jimmy 
[02:24:30]  I'm not a huge fan  like  I would say I'm more of a Hack Stones  I like the hits  but I like a few  As Tears Go By  that's a little deep  that's one of my favorite ones  it's kind of deep  is that  it is  you like the Mary Ann Faithful version?  oh I've never seen this one  this isn't in color  oh that's enough  that's satisfaction  yeah Sam  it's a different one  it's black and white  for Pete's sake  so why don't we go to break with this  because we got guests coming in  okay  what the fuck is Sam doing?  we're gonna go to break with this  thank you Dennis Falco  thank you guys  oh man 
[02:25:00]  Jimmy's pick today  I love it  wow  it's like a dumb bus  pushy machines  it is the evening  of the day  listen to the screaming  holy fuck  it's like the interns  when I walk in the room  my face is  I can see  but not  for me  I sit 
[02:25:30]  and watch  as tears go by  my riches  can't buy  everything  everything  I want to hear  the children  sing  all I hear  is the sound 
[02:26:00]  of rain falling  on the ground  I sit  and watch  the stairs go by  my eyes  and it is the evening  of the day  I sit  and watch  the children  play  doing things 
[02:26:30]  I used  to do  they think  are new  I sit  and watch  the tears  go by  I sit  and  I  학  what  is  is  what  i  are  my  the  are  the  people  the  who  have  the 
[02:27:00]  you  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[02:27:30]  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, no, I didn't want to have to think about it.  What happened?  What happened?  All right.  I want to say hi to Betsy Brand.  Welcome to the O.P. and Anthony.  Where's she?  Oh.  Bring her in.  From Breaking Bad, right?  Of course.  Is that the bubble wrap girl? 
[02:28:00]  She has bubble wrap.  Bring in your bubble wrap.  You got bubble wrap.  Why is she carrying around bubble wrap?  Betsy.  What's going on?  Do you like bubble wrap?  Well, yes.  And I'd pop it.  Yeah, let's pop some bubble wrap.  Let's do this.  What's wrong with you?  Let's share.  Let's do this.  I like to hear.  Let's see.  Oh, you like to sit on it.  Let's see.  You're too light.  That means you're light.  The chair is too soft. 
[02:28:30]  But if I sat on a hard table, which I was doing earlier, and then I'm like, oh, my back.  Oh.  Okay.  And it's like your back's cracking.  God, I'm sorry.  I had the chicken last night.  Oh, wow.  Oh, farts.  I got you.  Anyway, this is very comfortable.  It looks comfy sitting on bubble wrap.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, welcome to the show.  Are we on the air?  Believe it or not.  Well, we are.  We got to make that montage.  I'm telling you.  I know.  We always get people coming in and like, are we on the air?  We could do that.  We were listening to you talking. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah.  You were talking about bubble wrap.  Yeah.  What?  What?  That wasn't happening.  Oh, there it is.  Why is that such a good thing?  I don't know.  I don't know why.  It's the thing that people love to pop bubble wrap.  And this is pink.  Yeah.  Which is very fancy.  Ladylike.  Yes.  Just a fun sound.  I am nothing if not a lady.  Well, I make fart sounds with the bubble wrap.  Oh, I'm sorry, guys, but it just feels so much better. 
[02:29:30]  Betsy, you're, of course, Hank's wife, Marie, on Breaking Bad.  Yes.  I am completely involved.  Completely involved in the show.  I am not like, I am not one of these, you know, oh, I watched an episode because I knew  you were coming in.  I've been watching.  I have heard that you guys are fans.  Huge.  I love that.  It's more fun to talk about it. 
[02:30:00]  It really is.  If you're on the inside.  Yes.  And I got the advanced copy of the first episode.  Did you see it?  I saw it for the first time last night.  Did you?  Yeah.  It's so good, right?  Yeah.  No spoilers, but.  It's like these last eight episodes are just so amazing.  Just so amazing.  And you know, it's just this culmination of everything that's been happening, and it's  going to, it's not going to end well.  I know it's, it can't be this happy, fun little ending with the way this is going. 
[02:30:30]  I don't know what it is.  You, you probably do, but I don't know how it's going to end, but it can't be good.  Is that right?  I feel like.  I popped two bubbles if he's right.  It was two pops for a yes.  One for a no.  There it is.  Oh, that's three.  That means everybody dies in a fire.  Oh my God.  I guess Anna, in an interview, someone said that Anna said that, you know, the show doesn't  end prettily.  Yeah.  And they said, you know, is that a spoiler? 
[02:31:00]  And I said, I think happy ending for these people left the station, like, at least by season  two.  Very early on.  You're not going to get, you're not going to get an ending where the music goes,  ba-da-dum.  Right.  You know, nothing like that.  Hey.  Oh, look what we got here.  Dean.  Oh my God.  They know each other.  Dean Norris.  It's so weird.  Where does he go?  Where does he go?  Come here.  Dean, take a seat right there.  That's, oh, look.  Oh, the happy couple.  I got my bubbles.  The happy couple.  Look at that.  Now the bubbles are popping. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, they are popping.  Dean Norris is in studio.  He's sitting on Betsy's lap.  You look so handsome.  Look at him.  Doesn't he look great?  Yeah.  You're so handsome here.  Yeah, sitting on Betsy's lap.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Is the party over already?  Is it over?  Is the party over?  No.  No party.  No party's going.  You just got here, honey.  Now it can begin.  It's so odd to see, like, you guys are a TV show couple.  And there you are.  Yes. 
[02:32:00]  It's like watching Lucy and Ricky.  It's amazing.  He never stops working.  Okay.  He's never, never stopped working.  He's landing the space shuttle right there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Of course.  Hank.  Yes, sir.  From Breaking Bad.  I was just saying, I saw the advanced copy.  I've been fully involved in the show over the entire course of it.  And then I finally saw the first episode of the new season without any spoilers or anything.  I got to tell you, wow. 
[02:32:30]  Wow.  I was sitting there just not wanting that screen to go dark and have the credits come up.  Oh.  Because now I've got to wait.  And the closing scene of that is just, it's brutal.  It's subtle brutality.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, Walter gives that a threat.  It's a threat.  Yeah.  I'll say that much.  But it's done in that inimitable, quiet style. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And as Hank's wife, what role are you going to play in this?  I mean, things are going down.  We know from last season, of course, Hank took that dump and picked up that book that  pretty much revealed what was going on.  And now, how...  What do you mean, what role am I going to...  You talk about his dump and then you ask me what role I'm going to play.  Well...  I mean, she changed my bedpan in season four, but...  He comes out of the bathroom and then Marie comes out.  She's washing her hands. 
[02:33:30]  You go through this series with...  You're very naive.  What do you mean?  I don't know.  You're kind of...  You're not really willing to accept that something bad's going on.  Oh, well, is it...  Is it that she's naive?  You just popped my bubble.  That's what I meant.  You just popped my bubble.  I've been popping your bubble for six years.  I know.  It's working.  And it's working.  It's not that she's naive.  She just doesn't know.  Yeah, but like...  Because who...  Look at Walt.  Yeah.  Like, what sister-in-law would be like, you know what I think? 
[02:34:00]  I think Walt's a drug kingpin.  Look at him in his ugly-ass shoes and that sick green car.  He's clearly...  Okay.  Good point.  But you'd think being married to a DEA guy, maybe something would rub off or you'd get  a little info or you'd stay out of his work, except when you were getting his rocks.  I don't think Marie stays out of anything.  Getting my rocks?  What?  Rocks off?  Getting his rocks off.  I don't think Marie... 
[02:34:30]  No, you can say that here.  Can you say motherfucker?  Motherfucker.  Yes, you can.  It's fucking rocks.  Fucking minerals.  They were minerals, right.  Your rocks are here.  They're fucking minerals.  Goddamn.  It's so good to not be on TV and you can say fuck.  I know.  I know.  All I do for the last two weeks is not say fuck and not say the ending of Breaking Bad.  Right, right.  Those are the two things you're not allowed to do.  Are we not supposed to say the ending?  Oh, man.  Oh, shit.  Wouldn't that be great?  You can say whatever the fuck you want. 
[02:35:00]  Please say the ending.  I want to know it, but then don't want to know it.  No.  I want to see it.  I know.  I want to see it happen.  You don't want to know it.  No.  Do you know it?  No.  Sometimes you guys don't know it.  Oh, yeah.  We know it.  Oh, yeah.  No, we know it.  All right.  Sometimes you guys come in, you're from a series and you don't know for sure.  What are they on?  What are they?  Meth?  They know.  It's, yeah, this is it.  This is the end.  And it's...  It has to be a little. 
[02:35:30]  It has to be a little emotional, right?  Oh, man.  Seriously.  Yeah.  Especially this week.  Sorry.  Yeah.  Could you get me a coffee, Dean?  Could you open me a coffee?  You got one.  Straight up.  I'll pass you some coffee.  Straight up.  That's how I do my liquor, baby.  I'm good.  I'm good.  I'm good.  You sure you're good?  Yeah.  I had a cup of coffee this morning.  I had some chocolate with my real husband.  Oh, damn.  I didn't say that to be mean, but it sounded mean, and I didn't mean it.  That's what you mean.  You know I'm married in real life.  Oh, man.  On the show.  You know that, right?  Fuck.  This is ruining everything. 
[02:36:00]  This is ruining everything.  I feel like I need to tell you.  I'm so sorry.  It's a little late, isn't it?  Hey, but I'm always thinking about you, baby.  You're who I really love.  When you play a couple, is there any real attraction there?  It's got to be difficult to not feel something if you're playing a married couple.  I feel absolutely nothing.  Not me.  I feel it all.  It's a job.  They go, cut.  I run.  I feel it all.  No, I miss you so much. 
[02:36:30]  In all seriousness, in all seriousness, it was such an amazing thing to have Betsy  Brandt play my wife.  More than I can tell you, she just added so much.  Her inner humanity comes out in the role, and it's such a great thing, because I think  it was such a big part of Hank's, like, his own morality, you know?  It stemmed...  If he wasn't married, he would have broke bad a long time ago.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That feel.  And I feel like having Betsy play Marie just... 
[02:37:00]  It will always be, like, just an amazing part of, for me, a memory of the show, because  she brought all that to it, and it was like, oh, man.  It's just awesome.  You're going to make me cry, man.  Oh, shush.  Really, you are.  You're going to make me cry.  It does seem like the only real, real true loyalty you have is to the family, to your  family.  And that pretty much holds you from probably, yeah, going the way of Walter.  Going really bad, and he kind of would just think back. 
[02:37:30]  At least I did as a character, would always, in the kind of crucial moments, and there are  some more crucial moments coming up, would always just think back to my wife, you know,  and go, all right, that's why I've got to be strong, and that's why I've got to be the  good guy, and go from there.  I love these two.  I love being a part of this couple.  Yeah.  And to do that with you.  You know, but even from the beginning, I just, I love that they would do anything for  each other.  Yeah.  And in the show work, people are just horrible to each other, and they decapitate this guy  and stick his head on a turtle, and we have this beautiful relationship. 
[02:38:00]  Yin-yang, I think that's what they call it.  He is, yeah, in the middle of all that turmoil.  You know, I always loved that.  And trouble, yeah, trouble, like, I always refer back to a scene where Hank is basically  leaving the DEA, and he gets this elevator, and you never see him.  He doesn't even make a phone call or anything, but somehow his wife just knows that it's  a bad day, and she shows up.  I'm sorry.  When you talk about that, I remember that.  And I remember on that day, like this, like a second, and I remember, I said, just don't 
[02:38:30]  look at me until we do the take.  It was the only time I said some crazy method acting like that.  But I did, because it was such an emotional moment, and I just couldn't, but as soon as  I looked at her, it was just, you know, tears, you know, just because, you know, it was like  the worst day, and he's like, fuck, and then the elevator opens, and it's his wife, you  know?  Yeah, yeah.  Wow, that is...  And it did, you know how hard it was for me in that moment not to cry? 
[02:39:00]  And I remember asking Frida, who did our makeup at the time, I said, did we get it?  Did we get it?  Did they tell you we got it?  And they said yes, and then I just sobbed, which I did a lot on the show, because Marie  doesn't let go and cry, and also I think in that moment, she just wouldn't.  She's like, no, this is all about you, baby.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You know, it's not about me, you know, it's not about me crying, and it's, you know, it's  about me being there for you.  Yeah, awesome.  Wow, that's getting really deep into your character when you're on set like that.  Oh, my God.  It was so fun. 
[02:39:30]  It was fun.  I'm going to miss it.  When did you wrap?  How long ago?  End of March, beginning of April.  Really?  I honestly don't even know.  I feel like I'm in this weird time zone that I really don't even know, but that sounds  right.  What he says sounds right.  So you've been doing press and stuff, and then I guess that's kind of, wow, and then  you're just done.  It's crazy.  It's kind of hitting me now this week.  Like when we wrapped, I had to go to another job, and so did you.  So it was less, I don't know, just, I mean, you were kind of emotional about it, but 
[02:40:00]  it wasn't, this week though, it's like this kind of final victory tour, you know, and  I was like, wait a minute, I'm not going to see this.  I thought I was doing better with it than I am.  Now, now that I'm like, wow, last premiere, wait, what do you mean last?  Yeah.  That's not coming back.  Yeah, we can fake it though.  We can like just make a problem.  I asked him, I asked him, I told AMC last night, I said, if you bankroll it, I'll shoot  three more.  We'll show up and do the work.  I'll do it.  Just three more.  I'll do it.  I'll do it for free.  I know, who wouldn't? 
[02:40:30]  Who wouldn't?  That's what I said, as long as they bankroll it, and we'll show up.  I think a kind of a goofy spinoff where you're almost like the new Ropers.  That way, you go from that.  I get to wear a cap to that.  I'm in.  I love that.  I love that.  Oh, I'm sorry, you're already on another sitcom.  My bad.  Oh, that's right.  I'm sorry, you're stuck in a bubble.  That's a dumb motherfucker.  That's a dumb.  What is that?  How do you do that?  It's a dumb, man.  That's a dumb.  How do you do that?  It's a bad ass dumb.  When you touch it, it gets all weird. 
[02:41:00]  Steven Spielberg, man.  It messes you.  Oh, you making fun of Steven Spielberg?  Is that what you're doing?  You want to make fun of Steven Spielberg and his TV show?  Yep.  How about Steven King?  You want to make fun of him too?  No.  Okay.  No, I'm not making fun of anybody, Dean.  I'm just asking about the special effects.  Under the dog.  I can't watch that show at night.  Really?  Really, for real, I can't.  I told my husband, I'm like, we cannot watch it before we go to bed.  Too creepy?  I can't.  It just freaks me out.  It freaks me out to be trapped in there.  It's crazy.  Yeah, well, they're all under there, so it's kind of nice.  Oh, I just got a pit feeling in my stomach.  A little microcosm of humanity under the dog. 
[02:41:30]  But I'm there, I'm there.  But you're stuck.  You're all stuck.  What you going to do with all that fuel?  What you going to do?  Stay tuned.  Big Jim.  What you going to do?  And Betsy, you're working with Michael J. Fox.  Yes.  That's got to be pretty damn cool.  It's great.  Easy, easy, easy.  It's no Dean Norris.  Okay, thank you.  Temper that easy.  But he's pretty great.  Watch it.  Yeah.  I know.  Do you just feel compelled?  Again, thinking of you the whole time, baby.  Domestic violence is like this club. 
[02:42:00]  Thinking of you the whole time.  Do you feel compelled to just ask Michael J. Fox back to the future questions?  I would just ask him that all the time.  But how did this, how many DeLoreans were in that one scene?  If you think about it, you'd just be like, shut up.  No, I don't.  But I do feel compelled to go, sha-la-la-la.  All right.  Well, from Family Ties.  The theme song, yes.  Sha-la-la-la.  I hope you can get the rights to that.  Otherwise, this whole time. 
[02:42:30]  That is pretty good that you two go from Breaking Bad to other.  Hit shows.  Very hit shows.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, come on.  Not too shabby.  Yeah.  Not too shabby.  You're going to have to watch your language, though.  I didn't know.  Yeah.  Yeah, that's another thing.  You're good at that.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm pretty.  You can't turn to Michael J. Fox and go, what the fuck are you doing?  Like, oh, man.  That is usually how I talk to people.  I think you confuse me with my friend Dean Norris.  Are you normally more reserved or a little potty mouth? 
[02:43:00]  Oh, no.  I'm a potty mouth.  I try and keep it in check with my children.  Yeah, huh?  How old are your kids?  Eight and four and a half.  Yeah, those are those very formative years where they'll just pick up everything, right?  You know, there's that time where you're like, oh, my little boy, when he was a toddler,  was like, oh, he's not listening.  He's not listening.  He's not talking.  And then, like, he spilled his sippy cup and he goes, God damn it.  And I told my husband, I said, it's not like he's trying to say fork and he says fuck,  which we think is hilarious. 
[02:43:30]  You know, instead of sitting, he says shit.  Also really funny.  There's plenty of videos out there.  I said, this is cursing.  And then I posted on my Facebook page.  I go, my little boy said, God damn it today.  And I said, he totally gets that fucking shit from my husband.  Gets that fucking shit language from my husband.  So a little bit of a potty mouth, yeah.  A little bit.  But I really try and keep it in check.  It's just sometimes there's no better word.  Fuck's a great word.  Yeah.  There's no better word.  It is. 
[02:44:00]  People should get off their ass about it, Sarah.  Right.  Fuck you, man.  It's a fucking great word.  We were talking about Breaking Bad and how it's so good to have these networks now that  allow real gritty language like that.  Because years ago, you had TV shows, detective shows or whatnot.  And it just took that edge off of it.  Dang it.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like, no one would talk like that.  Oh, darn.  It takes away from the character.  Absolutely.  It's distracting.  Because they would talk like that. 
[02:44:30]  Right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the Hank character is great.  And for the entire series, you're just like, come on!  Although you love Walter, you don't want him getting caught, but you don't want Hank looking  like a total idiot.  But he doesn't.  No, that's just it.  What's amazing is that that you haven't caught him.  And it's so, clearly, you're smart.  Your character is smart.  Oh, thank you.  Your character is so smart.  Fuck, I need that.  Like, I need that from you. 
[02:45:00]  Thanks.  Oh, I thought it was really stupid.  Thanks for like...  Well, they do sound married.  Oh, man.  I'm not going to tell you you're handsome anymore.  Yes, you are.  No, I'm not.  How about sexy?  No, I'm not.  Oh, come on.  I can't help it.  Yes, you're sexy, Dean Norris.  Oh, God damn it, you're so sexy.  But seriously, how great is that writing?  It is.  That you can have this whole cat and mouse thing.  It's amazing.  It works for both of you.  Right.  I always thought that was really...  Because he got me so close.  Yeah.  And it made sense that he didn't quite get...  And he figures out Gus Fring.  And he figures out some other things, you know. 
[02:45:30]  But I thought it was...  And sometimes it's funny.  There's one scene.  It's not a very popular scene.  But where I'm almost kind of catching him.  And Walt kind of squeals up next to me.  And he kind of distracts me.  And he does his little kind of Malcolm in the Middle thing.  Yeah.  The Malcolm in the Middle guy.  He's like, hey, hi.  And I was like, whoa, what the hell is this guy?  You know?  Yeah.  But so there are times where it's funny that Hank doesn't catch him.  And other times it's serious.  But I always thought it was good writing that they got him out of it.  I do like when he pops in with that Malcolm in the Middle character every so often.  It's so goofy. 
[02:46:00]  It is.  And then when you think of how ruthless he is, it makes it that much better.  One of my favorite scenes is when you're loading up the bags in the car.  And you say, what'd you get in here?  Ah, a million bucks in cash.  Yeah, right.  Yeah.  Right.  It's so funny.  Yeah, or when you notice the W.W.  In the first time.  And he just goes, you got me.  And it's like, no, it is him.  Yeah.  Come on.  Did you really want to be killed off in the first season to do a comedy pilot?  It wasn't the first season.  It was, I'll explain that. 
[02:46:30]  They picked up the last season, and it was 16 instead of 13.  So we go, okay, great.  They're going to shoot all 16, and then we'll be free to do other stuff.  And then the corporate, can I say douchebags?  Yeah, sure.  What are they going to do, fire you?  Yeah, right.  Fuck them.  So these douchebags decide that they're going to split it into two eight things for their own financial purposes.  Sure.  They're giving a fuck about my financial reasons.  So I've got to sit there and wait a whole year, because I can't do anything else, because I'm contracted, to do a measly eight more episodes, right? 
[02:47:00]  So I'm like, you know, I've got a few kids to feed myself.  And I said, wouldn't it be great if the cliffhanger of the first eight, since you're going to do it this way, Hank dies, that way it frees me up to do another show.  And, of course, they said no, because we need you for the last eight.  And I'm glad they did.  And they ultimately did free me up in time, and you too, to do another show.  But originally, that wouldn't have been the case.  Then you'd be sitting on your ass for another year, waiting for another pilot.  Wow.  That's got to be frustrating. 
[02:47:30]  So I was like, you know, I mean, I love the show, and I'm down with art and all that stuff, but, you know, I act to live.  I don't live to act, you know what I'm saying?  I love it.  You're such an opposite of some of the people we've had through this.  You've been getting paid the whole time?  I would do anything.  I stood for four years in the desert just to do the last eight episodes of Breaking Bad.  I don't care.  I'll starve.  Pay me.  I'll starve.  I'm like, fuck it, man.  I need another job, you know?  Pay me.  It's called Under the Dome, CBS, baby.  Yeah, Under the Dome.  Blockbuster, motherfucker. 
[02:48:00]  That's huge.  That is huge.  You were in fucking Total Recall.  No, I wasn't.  No, not you.  Before my time.  You got a lot of nerve showing your face around here, Houser.  That's before my time.  Look who's talking.  That's the one.  You got a lot of nerve showing your face around here, Houser.  Who are you on Terminator 2?  We can do Arnold Schwarzenegger again.  I think I, believe it or not, I think I'm probably the highest paid per line, because I had like one line, and I was on that movie for like two months.  This is back in the day when they would take, like, you know, they didn't give a shit. 
[02:48:30]  Caraca was throwing money out, you know?  And we're like, oh, wow, you're paying me to sit here for a month in a hotel?  Great.  And then I go and do one line, you know?  I forgot what the line was.  I show up, I'm a SWAT team leader, and I show up, and I don't know, I point the gun at somebody and say something.  Like, don't do it or something.  How much did you get paid per word?  I'm saying, if you had two months to pay for, you know, one word.  That ain't bad.  That ain't bad.  Yeah, no.  Shit.  Bye.  What else have you, like, what did you early on work on?  Anything we'd know? 
[02:49:00]  I didn't dig in.  Thank you.  Not you, Jimmy.  You could find it.  I know.  Thank you for that.  If you know what I'm saying.  A lot of, some people call it adult films.  I call them art.  That's how I met Dean.  I win.  Oh.  And he said, let me get you on the show.  A little show I'm doing on cable.  I did mostly, you know, I did some movies, but it's smaller indie movies.  I did one movie with Blythe Danner and Peter Fonda, which was really fun. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, wow.  And then I did just a lot of drama on TV.  Yeah.  And it's like, once you start doing drama, people choose that, and then you just do more of it.  But it was really fun to do, so that's what I did.  You're on some Lifetime movies.  No.  Where the husband, all of a sudden, he's the greatest guy in the world, and then, oh, boy.  Uh-oh.  And the best friend always knows he was a scumbag.  Right.  No, I never did anything like that.  But what I am, I am disappointed I never did that show with David Caruso.  NYPD?  No, no, no.  CSI Miami.  CSI Miami. 
[02:50:00]  Oh.  I did NYPD Blue.  Yes.  The first season with David Caruso.  And I was ready to go.  That was my first serious TV gig.  And I had a contract to go for the second season, and I'm all excited, and all over the  summer, I hear fucking Caruso decides that he's going to quit.  And do movies.  And do movies.  Jade.  Ooh.  That worked out for me.  That was a good one.  That was the worst decision.  That was worse than fucking McLean Stevenson leaving MASH.  That was a good one.  That's probably the worst decision.  Yeah, yeah.  It's one of the ones.  Oh, I don't know.  It's one of them. 
[02:50:30]  Because I was his best friend, so my, like, six episodes I was going to do the next year  was cut.  Yeah, your character all of a sudden becomes irrelevant.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that was early on when that mattered, you know?  Yeah, you're probably like, well, that's it.  I'll never act again.  Yeah.  I'm never going to get another gig.  No, half the time I've been in L.A., I've been on Breaking Bad.  Wow.  Yeah.  Isn't that crazy?  Yeah.  That's crazy.  That's crazy.  That's most of it.  So I've really been in New Mexico.  Yeah, I know.  That's fine.  Betsy has to go.  Yeah, that's right.  Oh, Betsy has to go. 
[02:51:00]  It sounds like I have to pee.  You have to go.  Why does she have to go?  Is it my bubbles?  She's still got bubbles to pop.  You're a busy girl.  She has to go.  You're promoting.  Promoting.  What's the name of the Michael J. Fox show?  Michael J. Fox show?  It's called Michael J. Fox show.  Yeah.  All right.  We just went out there and we're like, hey, let's call it the Michael J. Fox show.  You know, this woman right here is the new Lucille Ball.  I've been telling her that for the last five years.  Yeah.  You always did say that.  I did.  And I love that about you.  After Michael J. Fox, it's going to be like the Betsy Branch show. 
[02:51:30]  I do tell Mike.  I say, you know, for the Michael J. Fox show, I really thought it would be a lot more about  me.  Yeah, it should be.  And it will be.  Like, I want more dancing on the show because there's really no dancing on the show.  You do that chocolate thing where you...  Yeah, yeah.  You know, the chocolate's going by.  You know, the Lucille.  Yes.  So, Lucy's shoving the chocolate in her face.  I step on the grapes.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Stepping on the grapes.  I'm giving a great vat of grapes in and I'm going to stop on it.  And then you get all starstruck by celebrities.  Right.  Yeah.  That's great, right?  You try to break into their houses in Hollywood.  I do.  I do get star...  I met Linda Lavin in the kitchen of the Beverly Hilton this weekend. 
[02:52:00]  There's a new gun in time.  I thought she was...  I thought she had passed.  Oh.  She's doing a Broadway show.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Linda Lavin?  Oh, hold on.  No, I'm thinking of the other one from the one with Schneider that was on the show.  Are you thinking of...  Trees company?  Bonnie Franklin.  Bonnie Franklin.  Bonnie Franklin.  A banana, Bonnie Franklin.  I know.  No, because I was always into the Linda Lavin, the Alice theme song that she sang.  It's like, not only does she star in the show, she's singing the theme song. 
[02:52:30]  I didn't know she sang the theme song.  Yes, she did.  Oof.  Oh, it's so bad.  She's like, all like jazz club.  There's a new gun in town and she's looking good.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  I'll see that show.  You'd think the guy had a fresh second face in the neighborhood.  And it's like, you'd think they would be like, maybe we should get someone else to sing this.  Do you think I could sing the Under the Dome?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  That was good.  Did you make that happen?  Oh, I can make that happen.  I can make that happen. 
[02:53:00]  Under the Dome.  Under the Dome.  Under the Dome in town.  Who indexes the Dome so you could see?  Is that a...  Wow.  Bob Marooney.  I actually thought that was a serious question.  I did, too.  No.  For a moment, I did.  I did, too.  But that's funny.  Oh, thank you.  Wait, is there a scene where birds fly into the Dome?  I like that they have TVs everywhere, so you can totally watch TV while I'm talking.  It's going to be great.  She's really got to go. 
[02:53:30]  That's a funny comment.  You're dragging her out here.  That's funny, but MasterCard is up about $12, $12.  We check our stocks.  And there's that guy who is...  S&P above $1,700.  Oh, Betsy Brandt.  Betsy Brandt will be looking for you in Breaking Bad and the Michael J. Fox show.  You're going to hate your next interview that you go to.  You're going to hate it.  Yeah, it's not going to be as good as what they just did there.  Yeah, bring the...  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  What?  You've got to take breaks?  Oh, man.  Real fast.  Can you stick around?  Is there...  Why is this shit now?  He's good to stick around.  No, yeah.  I wasn't even supposed to start until... 
[02:54:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Cool.  We'll be right back.  We'll be right back.  All right.  Perfect.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On SiriusXM.  Now, the O.P. and Anthony Show continues.  Oh, man.  Yeah, we're back, of course. 
[02:54:30]  Don't worry about it.  Let's see.  Dean Nars, of course.  Hank from Breaking Bad in here.  We were talking.  They would have been complete spoilers if we said it on the air.  So you weren't recording any of that, right?  Nothing.  Oh!  Wait, he gave away stuff?  Well, from the first episode that's coming up.  When does it air?  August 11th.  11th.  Yeah.  Wow.  And that's going to be one of the most watched shows, I think, ever.  It's going to be crazy.  It's huge.  Yeah, it's going to be crazy. 
[02:55:00]  Everyone I've talked to is just like, oh, man, Breaking Bad, I've got to see you.  I've got to wait.  Nothing's worse than when they cut those seasons in half.  And you're like, all right, here's 11 months.  Sit on it.  Have fun, kids.  Yeah, exactly.  You pricks.  So, yeah, and I watched the first episode, and people were just livid with me.  Yeah.  You fucking asshole.  And then, of course, why don't you put that up on Pirate Bay?  So I'm like, yeah, and I'll never get one again, so blow me.  But there are moments, because I saw it for the first time last night, and there are moments, 
[02:55:30]  it's great watching it with a big crowd, and there are literally moments in that show  where people go, oh, yeah, right?  Yeah.  Oh.  Or, ah, you hear like, yeah, the reactions from people are amazingly visceral.  And, you know, at the very beginning of it, and not giving anything away, but the way  they just start the show, and you're like, what the fuck is this?  Yeah, yeah, that was awesome.  It's a great teaser.  It really is a great teaser.  Yeah.  And, you know, again, not spoiling anything, but the neighbor. 
[02:56:00]  Ah, awesome.  And then they come back to that line.  Yes!  Yeah.  It's fantastically done.  There's a lot of inside talk here.  Oh, well, you know what?  It's very vague.  I think they'll have to watch August 11th.  Then they'll re-listen to this interview and get what we're talking about.  Oh, he was talking about the press.  I know what I want to ask.  That scene.  What did you, you went to Harvard, what did you go to Harvard for?  Because I got in.  Let me rephrase that.  Yes. 
[02:56:30]  Not why did you go to Harvard, but like, what was your measure?  It's called a concentration in Harvard, hate to be that guy, but it was called social  studies.  It was like economics, history, philosophy, and politics.  It was all kind of wrapped into one.  And it was great.  And you did well?  I did, yeah.  I was in honors.  I was in honors.  Jesus.  So you went, why did you, not the why did you do acting, but did your family go like  you probably shouldn't be acting if you graduated with honors from Harvard?  You know, all seriousness, I was the first kid to go, first guy to go to college at all 
[02:57:00]  from my family.  Both my parents didn't go to college and we came from, you know, kind of a lower middle,  you know, middle class to lower middle class.  So one would think I had the pressure to go into like, you know, investment banking or  being an attorney or something like that.  But my parents were cool as all, all get out.  And they were happier in a way that I went in to do something that I wanted to do.  Um, and, uh, so I had complete support of my parents.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Were you acting in college or did you like start acting? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, I did a lot of acting in college.  Um, it was all extracurricular because they didn't have really any, you know, there wasn't  like an acting program or anything like that at Harvard.  But I got to work with some really interesting people, uh, like Amy Brenneman was in, in my  year.  Uh, the directors, uh, uh, like RJ Cutler and Bill Roush, who, who work today in the business,  very successful.  And, uh, I learned, uh, learned the craft.  I would do maybe three a semester, so six a year in terms of, uh, plays there and then  learned a lot.  The American Repertory Theater was there, um, and, uh, got to work with them a little 
[02:58:00]  bit as well.  What got you into acting at all?  Like what?  I'm a failed musician.  I'd like to have been a, uh, you know, rock band.  Really?  Yeah.  Okay.  But it was, it didn't quite work out.  So I was like, eh, I'm in that boat.  Yeah, so I ended up here.  We're the guys buying guitars at Guitar Center now.  We're like the, hey, man, can I buy a new Strat because I can afford it now?  I can afford to buy this shit, but it sounds really good in my garage. 
[02:58:30]  That's hilarious, man.  I put, I got a band together actually, maybe, I don't know, about, I don't know, 10 years  ago with exactly that.  Like some neighbors, you know?  Yeah.  And we're like, hey, let's do a band, man.  So we get out of the house on Saturday night.  It's still fun, you know?  That's awesome, man.  Look around, my brother, he plays out all the time and shit and, you know, if he's  ever like, yeah, I'm doing a gig over here, why don't you come on by and, you know, sing  some stuff.  That's awesome.  It's just, it's always been a lot of fun to do, but when you realize you just, the odds 
[02:59:00]  of making it are, uh, forget about it.  Yeah.  Uh, so you, you, you, you, you obviously like performing.  Yeah.  And I mean, I, my, you know, my dad was like a, you know, uh, had a band all his life  and that's how we made half his money, but you know, local, local kind of band, you know,  weddings and, and bars and things like that.  And so I would play with, uh, play in the band with him sometimes.  And so there, it was always like a, and he came from a dad who, uh, he didn't know very  well, but was also a musician.  Wow.  So it was like rock and roll, you know, kind of musicians. 
[02:59:30]  And then, so it was, in a way it was kind of cool that I made it at least in the entertainment  industry, even though it wasn't music, because it was a long tradition of people who kind  of, you know, wish they didn't want a real job.  Yes, pretty much it.  I understand that completely, man.  I did not want to grow up.  Exactly.  Where, where did you grow up?  South Bend, Indiana.  South Bend.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  So what was there to do around there as a kid?  Uh, drink beer.  Drink.  Yeah.  Blue collar, uh, kind of. 
[03:00:00]  Exactly.  Very blue collar.  Yeah.  Uh, and, um, it was great.  It was a great place to grow up.  I love South Bend.  I go back there for Notre Dame games at least once a year.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  And I still have a sister who's there.  So, um.  Did you, did you have some, like, real shitty kind of regular jobs growing up at all?  Well, I, yeah, it was like, I washed dishes at 14, you know?  Oh, man.  It was at the El Adobe restaurant in, uh, in, uh, San Juan Capistrano, California, washing dishes  at, like, 13.  Yeah.  I washed dishes hot back there.  And, uh, yeah, that, yeah, and I worked at, uh, and then as a, as a, when I got to be 
[03:00:30]  an adult, I started doing waiting jobs when I was in college.  Yeah.  As a waiter in the summer.  Oh, a waiter slash actor.  That's something, uh, you never hear that.  Oh, yeah, there's a lot of them.  Oh, literal Jimmy.  It was a great, actually, when I got, I got my first gig in L.A.  It was, it was relatively soon when I, I mean, within five months.  And I'm literally, I was, uh, waiting tables and, uh, my agent calls and says, hey, you 
[03:01:00]  gotta leave the weapon too.  I'm like, oh, what does that mean?  You know, what the fuck that means, you know?  Well, here's what it means.  It means X amount of dollars per week.  Here's what it means.  I was like, what?  You know, it was like basically five times per week what I was making.  I said, are you sure?  I said, he said, yeah, I guaranteed.  So I took my little waitress thing off, waiter thing off.  I said, hey, this hamburger goes to this table.  That guy gets the steak.  See you later.  I'm out of here.  Yep.  Who are you going to leave the weapon to?  That was a great one.  I was, uh, uh, the guy that most people remember it because, uh, I'm the guy we're playing poker 
[03:01:30]  and I go turn on the stereo and we get blown up.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  But if you look back, we're in the whole front, we're in the whole beginning of the, we're  chasing people with Mel Gibson and all that kind of stuff.  Again, this was a, this was the day when, like that movie, last 18 weeks, I remember  this because it was like a really important number.  Sure.  18 weeks I worked on that show.  And, uh, and I still get paid today because everyone watches, you know, they show it again  and again.  And you still get some checks for that.  Oh man, seriously.  It's amazing.  God damn. 
[03:02:00]  That must've been pretty good though.  Like finally getting, uh, getting a job, being able to walk away from waiting tables.  Yeah.  Especially because the job that paid you enough that you didn't have to, you know, um,  and then the residual start coming in and then I get to, I did hard to kill right  after that.  With, uh, and then I did a total recall.  So I was like, Oh, okay.  This is just, all right.  It seems easy.  I'm in.  I'm in.  I'm in the door.  What's everyone complaining about?  And you were lost?  I did one episode of lost, like kind of a, almost a kind of a cameo.  I did like two scenes in it.  Yeah.  Oh, who did you play lost? 
[03:02:30]  I don't even, I can remember.  Some, some guy who'd lost his, his son or something and, and some guy on lost was able  to try to, I don't know.  I was going to see if he can connect me with him in the after world or some shit like that.  I don't know.  One of those lost fucking storylines.  Yeah.  I just did it because it was like a classic show.  I think I was already on Breaking Bad and I was like, I just wanted to be on it because  it's a classic show.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Actually, the director was a guy named Jack Bender, who is the executive producer and director  on Under the Dome now.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  Oh, really? 
[03:03:00]  In fact, these are his, uh, I'm wearing his shoes right now.  Why?  What the fuck?  Yeah.  You see those shoes?  Yeah.  I see there's paint on them.  There's paint because he's a painter and, and like he, so he'd always wear them.  He's a real legit painter.  Right.  So he'd always wear them and he has like a kind of a, you know, like scarves and shit.  I'm like, fuck that shit, man.  So we got drunk one night and I literally, I fucking took them like this and I ripped the  shoes off and I, and I have them to this day.  And you wear them.  I wear them.  Yeah.  I took his shoes right off his feet.  It's amazing they fit.  You know, I can't go to a sneaker store and buy fucking comfortable shoes. 
[03:03:30]  Yeah.  It would have been amazing.  I would have wore them anyway if they didn't fit, but, uh, but they happened to fit and  and he kind of struggled, you know, kind of drunkenly went home like barefoot.  I gave him, I gave him my shoes.  Did you get to, uh, meet, uh, Stephen King at all?  Yeah.  And talk to him?  Oh, man.  How's that?  Yeah.  That's awesome, man.  Yeah.  What a great guy he is.  And he's a really, um, really down to earth and funny and, uh, and a, and a really good  guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He, uh, it goes under the dome.  That's, uh, yeah.  His, uh, his, his base on the book. 
[03:04:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Although we were deviating from his book, but he's cool about that.  And he's, he's down with that.  So I started the book, but I didn't finish it.  Like it was great when I got through.  I'm just such a bad reader now, but it was fucking excellent when I started.  Cause you're trying to read like three, four books at a clip.  And I get an undone and then I just surf pornography.  Every time I try to stuff jerky off, I'm like, I'm going to start fucking reading.  Keep your hands above the table.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  These computers don't work.  Are you, uh, do you, do you pay attention to any critics on Twitter or Facebook or anywhere 
[03:04:30]  else?  You know, I, I used to like when Breaking Bad first started because, uh, how am I doing?  Yeah.  How am I doing?  And it just got so much.  Just, you can't, you know, if you start, I think in the, any more towards of either Beyonce  or, you know, somebody's never scroll down.  Never scroll down.  Cause there's always something waiting for you.  There's always some dickhead.  He's sitting there jerking off in his fucking basement, you know, fucking Norris sucks.  Fuck you, you fuck. 
[03:05:00]  I'm sitting here right now to anybody who says shit to me on fucking, fuck you.  Fuck you.  The scroll down's classic.  You're so right.  Cause you get a few, you're like, oh, I think I'm going to scroll a little more.  I fucking, and you always scroll too far.  Too far.  Always.  I'm the best actor in the world.  Right, right.  Fuck you.  It always gets to the, and it negates all the good shit you just read.  That's what Vince says.  He says he can, he can read like 99 great things, but he'll only remember the one bad one.  The one shitty one.  The one shitty one.  The fucking asshole.  And you know who this asshole is, you know? 
[03:05:30]  No.  Just a douchebag who's making shit out of you.  We would talk about this like so many times, whereas like years ago, could you imagine if  somebody had to sit down and write a letter, hey, Clark Abel, you suck.  Yeah.  It had to go in the mail, fucking stamp mail.  And then it had to go through 15 levels of people.  Right.  If it ever got to them, it would be a miracle.  Right.  And now it's like any douchebag can just be like, you suck.  Clark sucks.  Yeah.  Great.  They're writing that right now.  Yeah.  Somewhere.  Leave the guy alone. 
[03:06:00]  Yeah, you bastards.  Fucking asshole.  What a piss.  It's been great to hang out and talk to you, man.  You're obviously one of my favorite shows that I watch and just a great character.  And if people, they just don't know what they're in store for.  What I saw just that first episode, it sets up for an amazing conclusion of Breaking Bad.  Yeah.  And I'll tell you what, every one of these eight is as impactful as the one you saw.  Right, right.  It really is.  I can't wait. 
[03:06:30]  One after another is like, ugh.  Are there people that are real, real close to you that you go, all right, here's what  happens.  Is there one person that you've told?  No.  Come on.  I swear.  That'd be tough.  That's crazy.  That's impossible.  Not even my wife.  Wow.  My wife didn't read the scripts this year either.  Does she know not to ask at this point?  It's like a CIA agent.  She doesn't want to ask.  She wants to watch it, too.  That's true, too.  I want to know, but I want to see it.  Yeah.  The perfect thing would be if I got every episode right now. 
[03:07:00]  Right.  And just watched it myself.  Right.  And gloated about it.  Right.  You get people that say, like, hey, man, how does it end?  And then literally, like, a split second later, they go, no, I'm just kidding.  Don't tell me.  Yeah, don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  Yeah, yeah.  So no one really wants to know.  And I understand, because it's a real joy to watch it unfold.  It is.  It's one of the most anticipated conclusions of a series ever, I think.  And the great thing about it is I think we get to go out going, yeah, we ended it correctly.  Oh, yeah.  Or satisfactorily, you know.  I was saying yesterday, this show could have gone for a few more years easily without even getting old. 
[03:07:30]  Right.  But to wrap it up in five seasons with amazing writing, amazing characters, and just an amazing story arc, you can't lose.  Yeah.  I mean, really.  It's awesome, actually, yeah.  And you're on Under the Dome.  When is that on?  That's on Monday nights at 10.  We're on our sixth episode already.  And that's just, you know, it's, I mean, it's a crazy show.  Yeah, yeah.  It's international.  We're the number one show ever in China, U.S. show. 
[03:08:00]  Really?  Yeah.  We're, like, in 200 countries.  It's amazing, man.  It's an insane concept.  It's an insane concept, but it's, like, the most, it's, like, the highest rated show, I think.  There's only one show higher in, like, all the network TV.  It's crazy.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, in terms of scripted, I don't know what these reality shows are.  But in terms of scripted, it's, uh, so it's, like, a whole, it's a, you know, and it's great.  It's obviously awesome to be on Breaking Bad and the greatness of it and all, but, you know,  Hollywood, man, you know what they fucking respect? 
[03:08:30]  Numbers, motherfucker.  Seriously.  Like, you hang out in Hollywood on Breaking Bad and you go, oh, we love your show.  It's such a great show.  You know, really.  Critically acclaimed.  Critically acclaimed.  You know, now you're like, fuck you.  I got fucking 3-3 in the demo, bitch.  I love it, Dean.  Thanks so much for coming in, man.  You're amazing.  I love it.  Thanks, guys.  Thanks.  This is After Opie and Anthony Live. 
[03:09:00]  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Welcome.  Let's try to keep everything under control today.  On After Opie and Anthony Live.  We're going to need another event.  Let's go straight to the phones.  Nick DiPaolo.  Sammy Roberts.  How you doing, man?  I guess I, uh...  Yeah, what happened?  When do they...  Since when do they wrap right on time? 
[03:09:30]  What the fuck is...  Well, they...  I mean, they...  I think their last contract negotiation went so smoothly that they decided that every  day they will be out the door by 10 a.m.  I'm like, uh...  Oh, fuck it.  I mean, I text Roland last night, and, you know, I'm not going to set my alarm at 6 a.m.  Fucking today to find out that, no, I can't do it.  So I just fucking get up when I get up.  Oh, you didn't hear back from Roland?  No.  What the fuck?  I mean, I got a text here from him now, but I don't know when he sent it.  It doesn't fucking say the time.  It says, we're waiting for you. 
[03:10:00]  Call in now.  Oh, so he didn't respond to your text, and then, like, at 8 o'clock in the morning,  he just decides to respond, all right, now.  Yeah.  And, like, you're going to set your alarm, like, I don't know when Roland's going to  text me, so just in case, I better be awake to call in.  No, exactly.  I mean, how do I know he's not going to text me back on, no, they can't fit you in?  Yeah.  So I just fucking get up when I get up, and I came downstairs, and, um...  I'm like, ah, it's 10, it's 10 o'clock.  They'll still be yapping, and they'll...  No, they're out the door.  Yeah, they're out the door.  There's somebody... 
[03:10:30]  Oh, Roland's in here.  What happened, Roland?  You just...  I sent you yesterday at 6 o'clock.  6 p.m.?  Yeah, during the movie.  What?  I was seeing a movie, uh, a screening, and I sent you the text.  Let me ask you a question.  Why the fuck doesn't it say at what time you received the text?  Yeah.  Well, it's...  No, I'm just saying, is that how your phone is, too?  It tells me when I fucking...  You know what I mean?  It tells me when I...  It doesn't tell me when the guy sent it to me.  Right, like it tells you when you sent yours, but not the other way around. 
[03:11:00]  Well, why is that?  I don't know.  And then, well, you're way out.  Like, you're like me.  You're a Westchester guy.  Yeah.  Do you have service in your house?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  So, Roland, what happened?  I don't know.  AT&T.  Anyway, but I'm at Helium this weekend in Philly, which is a great club.  Tonight, tomorrow night, Saturday night.  Yeah.  And, uh, I just wanted to get that in.  And I hope people are listening to you, Sam.  People do.  People do listen.  Well, especially because, like, uh, on Tuesday, there was a huge fight on this show. 
[03:11:30]  And, like, everybody's been talking about it.  So, everybody's probably tuned in now to be like, oh, my God, what's going to happen next?  So, it would be the opportune time for you to get these plugs in.  Yeah, and he...  What happened?  I'm embarrassed to say I don't know what happened.  What was the fight?  That's all right.  Troy.  You met Troy up here, right?  Troy.  He's a guy.  He's a tall guy.  He's, like, the one good-looking guy on the O&A staff.  He's, like, tall, and he's got full-sleeve tattoos and dresses well.  I don't think so. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah, I like that.  He's a good-looking guy who dresses well on the O&A staff.  No, I don't think I met that guy.  Yeah, no.  I think you're making me shit up.  I've got to be honest with you.  No, he just got into a huge fight with one of the guys that works here that, uh, I guess  he doesn't like him, but it's all been settled since then, but, you know, people have been  talking about it.  It really doesn't sound like an event.  I thought, like, fucking maybe Opie threw a cup of coffee and Anthony is on the phone.  No, this is all post-Opie and Anthony world action.  Everything, 10 a.m. is the cut. 
[03:12:30]  We can't talk about them.  We can't reference them.  But the guy said call back tomorrow at 9 if you're available.  Oh, you want to, you can call on a tomorrow, just in case.  Tomorrow at 9?  Yeah, so, it'd be perfect.  Yeah, no, that's terrific.  That's just fucking great.  Well, you got people listening now, so it's the Helium Comedy Club.  Yeah, Helium.  All weekend.  It's Nick DiPaolo.  It's the Helium Comedy Club, and I will set the alarm tomorrow and try to fucking call in. 
[03:13:00]  Matter of fact, what's your Twitter?  My Twitter is at Nick DiPaolo.  All right, so everybody tweet Nick DiPaolo and let him know at least you heard his plugs.  You know, if you're going to go, you should go.  Yeah, exactly.  But at least tweet him and let him know that he spoke to somebody this morning.  Exactly.  So when I don't get down there, I get down there, I'm not going to get my ass reined.  Yeah.  Fucking clubs, it's supposed to be in your contract, you know.  Well, when I got the contract for the gig fucking months ago, it should say he has to 
[03:13:30]  be there a day early for press, or da-da-da.  They call me fucking the day before the gig.  Hey, can you do this?  Can you do this?  They want me to go down to Philly and then come back tomorrow.  They're going to get me a car to come back to do O&A.  What?  It doesn't make any fucking sense to anybody.  No.  Yeah, exactly.  It's a little fucking testy, as usual.  Well, that's why people love you.  Are you going to do any press in Philly?  Yeah, I'm going to call you guys at 9 o'clock.  That's all right.  You get people like, I'm sure there's somebody in Oklahoma that's like, you know what, I 
[03:14:00]  wanted to make a trip out east.  I'm going to head to Philly this weekend.  Exactly.  I think there's a red-eye from Tulsa.  But yeah, I'm doing a couple of things.  I don't know.  There's some young guy who's got a very popular podcast that's kind of tied into the fucking  Helium Club or whatever.  Yeah, but you'd think like a club that's as good, like Helium's a great club, and it's been  in business for so long, you'd think they'd have their press shit figured out by now.  Well, yeah.  I mean, if they call me to wake up two days before the gig going, can you do WNK? 
[03:14:30]  Can you come down on Wednesday night if they put you up?  And, you know, I'm not going to spend an extra 24 hours in the city to do fucking eight minutes  of radio in the morning.  Right.  It doesn't make a fucking difference.  I've got to be honest.  Right, yeah.  I'm past that shit.  And this is how I shut them up when they go, oh, that's our morning radio.  I go, yeah.  And then I get on stage that night, and I go, who heard me this morning on the radio?  And out of the 150 people, there's six people who raised their hand, maybe. 
[03:15:00]  Isn't that a great place to be in your career when you know, if something's, you know what  doesn't make a difference.  Like, you don't have to waste your time with that nonsense anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah, but the problem is the people that are doing it are doing the press, you know,  they've been doing it two years, and they think they're running Vegas.  Yeah.  You know, they act like a fucking...  Well, we've got to make sure our ties with the local media stay tight.  And I understand that, but the point is, if it was all in the contract months ago, yeah,  you know, I'd say, yeah, okay, I'll come down an extra night early.  Even though I was working last night, I was already committed up here. 
[03:15:30]  I mean, half of it is probably all the radio shows are in there saying, all right, we  want to, whatever headliners you have coming in, we want to bring them on our show.  Like, if they don't bring you by their show, then the next time Joe Blow is working at  Helium, they're not going to want to take them, the radio station.  Yeah.  That's a lot of times that's the case.  But it's a great club, and the people are great.  It's just, you know, I just wish they gave me more of a heads up on the fucking press, 
[03:16:00]  you know?  Well, look, this is the biggest radio show there is.  This is not even OPM.  Yeah, it is.  After OPM Anthony Live is the biggest radio show there is.  There's Tom Popper calling in now, Nick DiPaolo.  That's right.  Everybody calls in to plug the...  So, Helium, once again, in Philly this weekend.  And tomorrow night, Saturday night, on Sansom Street.  And you've got to check him out.  Nick DiPaolo is a hilarious dude.  Thank you, Sam, for taking the call.  All right, man.  Good luck this weekend.  I appreciate it, brother. 
[03:16:30]  Yeah, of course.  And I guess we'll hear you tomorrow.  That's right.  Tomorrow.  I'm going to set my alarm on my fucking iPhone.  They'll be next to my bed.  You're going to show up to that club angry tomorrow.  You'll set your alarm.  You'll be up on time.  And then they won't even see the call.  Well, we'll get to him later.  We plugged him yesterday.  Yeah.  He was on the after show yesterday, right?  All right.  He got it in.  Yeah, he's good.  All right.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  Nick DiPaolo.  Yeah, some attacks him.  He's great.  It's a rare breed. 
[03:17:00]  Anthony pulls it off.  It's a difficult thing to be an angry man, especially when you live on the East Coast that's on the right side of things politically.  Not meaning correct, meaning, you know, conservative, but still be charming and still be funny.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Like when you go up there as angry as a man as Nick DiPaolo is and still manage to kind of endear yourself to the audience, that's a hell of a talent.  Yeah, he's hilarious.  I've seen him a couple times live at Carolines. 
[03:17:30]  I haven't figured that out yet.  Like, I come here and I air my little grievances and I act like a little wiener, and you know what everybody says?  What a little bitch.  He's a little bitch.  He's a little wiener.  I'm sick of this kid.  Poor Sam.  All right.  You don't have to be that harsh about it, Roland.  A dress?  Mm-hmm.  You son of a bitch.  Whoa.  Is that a little too much?  No, I thought I'd shit myself.  Larry in Illinois.  Good morning, Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  How are you?  Good, and I got to tell you something. 
[03:18:00]  It's good that you mentioned professional broadcaster, because maybe, I don't know, I'll ask Eric how he feels about this, because he's been in the business for a while.  I have to be honest with you.  Today, when Denny came in here, and he says that he used to do radio shows with a shirt and tie on, and he used to show up, like he's shown up for work in a suit working at a radio station, I was thinking to myself, it might be kind of cool to start doing, like, you know, shows.  Go back to old school? 
[03:18:30]  Dress nice, yeah, coming, wearing a tie, everybody's looking around like, what's his deal, what's he got going on?  Like, NBC radio, those old pictures, everybody has suits on.  Right, like, people would be like, oh, Sam must have some shit going on, I'd trick everybody.  I've been sitting here, you know, looking like a bum for years.  Or they say, are we paying him too much?  You think they'll give me a...  You never know, he's fine.  I would think that that argument would never come up.  I don't see how it logically could, but...  No, but I do see what Roland's talking about.  That could come to mind.  It's like, well, what is he complaining about?  He seems to be doing okay. 
[03:19:00]  He can't see it.  They'll never say it to you, but in their head, that's what they'll think, so then they'll never discuss finances with you again.  What's he complaining about?  The kid's got a suit.  If anything, you should be dressing down.  You think so?  I should just be a bum?  No, because I think...  I'm on the line of bum and Modell, so you have to walk that line.  Yeah, but you don't walk the line.  You dress like a bum.  There's no line.  You're on the other side of it.  Well, we can put out his own clothing on.  Like, you're not on the line of bum meets professionalism.  You just are a bum.  Yeah, so...  Well, you dress like a bum, I should say.  That's okay.  You're not a bum as a human being. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah, they should pay me more.  But I don't think that's what it is.  But...  Farheads.  I feel like you dress for the job you want, not the job you have.  And that they're like, oh, okay, this Sam Roberts, he must be a big shot.  Why else would he show up wearing a suit?  You know, he's the only one around here wearing a tie.  That's a guy we should be paying attention to.  Oh, what an ass.  He's never going to get my job.  You think that's what it is?  Yeah.  Look at this little schmuck walking around like he's somebody.  He hasn't figured it out yet.  No.  Because they go, we have a Hamptons home. 
[03:20:00]  They're like, oh, yeah.  Yeah, I'll be like, I got three ties.  Yeah, because the big wigs are all in the Hamptons.  So you don't, uh, you don't, Eric, you don't see yourself ever going a more formal route?  Um, not in this position at this level, no.  Yeah, but what happens if that's what it takes to get to the next level?  And it's not.  I feel like, you know, you wear nice clothes, maybe.  Look, I'm in a position...  Nice clothes, yes.  Suit and tie, no.  I'm in a position where I feel like I've tried almost everything. 
[03:20:30]  Well, try.  And desperation starts to sink in at a certain point, you know what I mean?  It's like, how long do I sit here until somebody notices that I'm the greatest unsigned talent that this entire company has?  They might come down soon if there's fucking trash cans stinking at the hallways.  I don't know what you're talking about.  There's no relevance to it.  There's trash cans in the hallways?  I mean, that doesn't...  They'll come to you.  They'll smell you.  Does that make any sense to what we're talking about?  Yes.  Okay, I'll figure, I'll get there. 
[03:21:00]  You'll get an hour.  I'll get there, okay.  What I'm saying is, you know, they're like, yeah, we'll throw them on after O&A if they don't go long and if Jim doesn't want to do an invite show.  And that's the most I'll ever get.  That's the biggest bone they'll throw me.  So maybe this is what it's going to take.  Maybe if I show up here looking like a professional, they'll be like, oh, he really must be a professional broadcaster.  Tom Ford that shit.  Tom Ford that shit.  Exactly, Roland.  So maybe they'll sit there and go like, what are we doing with these guys, Covino and Rich, on the air?  They come in like they just, you know, like they're going to a bar. 
[03:21:30]  This guy was wearing a suit.  He needs that gig.  Yeah, it was a flip-flop, but Sam's been coming for it.  Exactly.  Look at the shoes on Sam.  His toes are covered by leather.  Yeah.  And I'll bet there's a sock under there, too.  Well, you've updated your shoe and sock game in the last month or two.  And people have noticed, haven't they?  But have the right people noticed?  I think so.  Rob Cross asked me just down the hall yesterday.  He goes, what's with this new style change all of a sudden?  I said, you know, don't worry about it, man. 
[03:22:00]  And that's very nice of him, but he's not the one in a position that can change your career here.  Who is?  You'd have to go above Rob.  Nobody above Rob will talk to me.  See, that's the problem.  And you know what's going to...  And I don't think your outfits are going to change that.  I'll bet they will.  I'll bet they'll be sitting there going, oh, this guy's wearing a suit.  But he shouldn't be talking to Rob Cross.  Rob Cross doesn't even wear a suit.  No.  Or they could go, why is this asshole wearing a suit?  That's Roland's theory, too.  That's the opposite side of the spectrum.  Or are you sure you wear the suit?  Just walk around by where all the bigwigs sit. 
[03:22:30]  They sit in the glass office.  Just walk by like twice a day.  Like, who is this guy?  Why is he going down that hallway?  It just ends.  Who is he?  I'll walk by holding a cup of coffee and walk in very fast.  Like, I'm on my way to someplace.  This is what they do.  Just look down, texting, and just nod your head and just turn around and walk back the other way.  Will it work with an iPhone or do I have to get a Blackberry?  An iPhone.  They all have iPhones.  They've upgraded to the iPhone?  So you just go, ah, and walk by their offices.  You also have to get designer glasses.  Yeah.  Okay.  I don't even need glasses.  I know. 
[03:23:00]  I don't think a lot of people around here do either.  Is it okay if they don't have lenses?  You can get just the regular plastic in it.  Is that something I can get at Urban Outfitters?  Not if you want to be noticed.  Okay.  I think Johnny Tubestakes has a pair.  Johnny Tubestakes, does he get noticed or is that just because?  He does because he wears glasses.  Or because his name is Tubestakes.  He dresses up.  Johnny Tubestakes is a guy who's been in here a couple times.  He's loved by all.  He auditioned for Sal's job at one point, and he got it, but the switch was never made.  Larry, I should go to you. 
[03:23:30]  You've been sitting here for so long.  Well, Sam, the thing is that you coming in and wearing a suit,  and I understand the concept of dressing for the job that you want.  Exactly, Larry.  Career move.  But you have to think about Dennis wearing a suit and calling himself a professional broadcaster.  Yes.  But as great as he is on the show, and as great as he is in what he does,  he's not an on-air talent.  And you might have Troy Kwan standing in your face, calling you the F-word if you wear a suit, 
[03:24:00]  because all the suits at XM are management.  And if that's what you aspire to be, great.  But what if, what if, I start wearing this suit, thank you, Larry, and people start noticing,  and they're like, that's somebody I have to take notice of.  Then once they take notice, they realize, holy shit, look at the talent on this little motherfucker.  How did that guy slip right under our, right out, right, he was right under our nose the whole time.  Um, and now he's wearing a nice tie? 
[03:24:30]  Yeah.  And I'll add a tie clip, too.  Because I don't see, um, too many, I don't think they wear ties here anymore.  I haven't seen that many ties at all.  Exactly.  And that's what you gotta look for.  What's not being done?  What's not happening?  A jacket and ties.  No, not this summer.  You don't see it, right?  No.  Justin Timberlake sings all about it.  Suit and tie.  Right.  I mean, there's plenty of people dressed like schlubs around here.  That's, I mean.  Oh, a dime a dozen.  A dime a dozen.  That's not gonna stick out at all.  But if I came, like, I'm ready to, I'm here to get some business done, that may be the secret. 
[03:25:00]  Yeah.  I'm starting to convince you, I think.  Not for you, but for me.  It could work for you.  I mean, for you, you're gonna stick with Models?  The Models collection?  Um, yes.  Roland's wardrobe only comes from sporting goods stories.  Maybe one day Jay-Z will think about it, like, throw those bitches up.  Like, yeah, Models!  Oh, so you're hoping that one day a famous rapper mentions Models and then you'll be cool.  Yeah.  Yeah, I gotta go to the most.  It's David in Chicago. 
[03:25:30]  Hi, Sam.  How's it going, buddy?  Pretty good.  I work for a company and we were doing presentations.  Uh, and one of the guys who works for me wore a suit and tie and she went for presentations.  Mm-hmm.  And he was the last in stock.  Everyone laughed.  He would take his douchebag on the planet.  Well, what does he usually wear?  He usually wears whatever everyone else wears.  Tucked in a shirt and a cat.  Yeah, he just went overboard.  And I think it depends on your personality, too.  He just couldn't pull it off.  No. 
[03:26:00]  Yeah, I'm starting to think it would have to be the right suit, but I think I might be able to pull it off if I did it delicately.  Because, like, for instance, you know, I started wearing, uh, you know, different, I stopped wearing sneakers, right?  And started wearing shoes with, with nicer, with nicer socks.  And that got noticed at first, but then it gets ignored.  So then you incorporate wearing pants instead of jeans.  So that's like, okay, I guess it goes with the shoes and socks.  If you do this piece by piece, one day, you just realize, oh, he's the guy who wears, like, suits. 
[03:26:30]  Do you think?  Oh, David's gone.  Yeah, he'd be Barney Stinson.  Who's Barney Stinson?  How I Met Your Mother.  She's suit up.  Is that Neil Patrick Harris?  Yeah.  He looks great all the time.  Yeah.  Yeah, like he says, suit up.  Yes.  Where does he shop for suits?  Probably someplace very expensive.  He doesn't exist.  He doesn't exist?  No.  I've seen him on the telly.  Yeah, but that's the character.  But if he does exist, I'm sure it's a nice suit place.  Yeah, his character probably shops at very expensive places. 
[03:27:00]  That's what, I, I, I, I can't do that.  Uh, let me go to Sean in Alabama.  Hey, Sam, this would be a good excuse for you to go out and get a real nice set of gaudy cuff links and a kerchief.  My silky.  Well, maybe that's the trick.  What are those, uh, uh...  Ascot's?  Ascot's.  What if ascot's is my thing?  No.  You don't think I could pull off the ascot?  The Charles Nelson Riley?  Do you think I could pull off wearing a suit?  Suit?  Yes.  Do you think I could pull off wearing a suit with an ascot instead of a tie?  And work here?  No. 
[03:27:30]  You don't think so?  No.  What if I used a, what about a bolo tie?  You know what a bolo tie is?  Yeah, but I'm trying to...  Maybe a bow tie.  They're not going to like that either.  It's totally...  Not a bolo tie.  What about a bow tie?  What if a full tuxedo?  Do you think so, Roland?  I think you can.  They'll be like, why is a dick wearing a tuxedo?  If I started coming in and being like, look guys, I'm really trying to advance my career  as on-air talent here at SiriusXM.  That's why there's tails on my jacket.  And have the intern play like mirrors on the...  Like walking behind you.  Always. 
[03:28:00]  Always.  Always.  Come dancing in to putting on the Ritz.  Yeah, but see, here's my problem.  I'm so out of touch with what's going on in terms of style.  I'm thinking of like the Fred Astaire type of tuxedo.  Not like...  I have no idea how to...  You should because nobody's doing that.  Fred Astaire stuff.  Yeah.  Like with the top hat and the cane and the tape.  White gloves and the cane.  White gloves.  Everything.  I think...  Do you know what you need though?  I think I need you to send to my buddy Kevin because he's working on the new Adam Levine  line.  Okay.  He's a good looking guy.  And his new pants and new clothing line is pretty awesome. 
[03:28:30]  But Adam Levine's naked all the time.  No, no, but it's like his new pants and his shirts.  And look how well he's doing, Sam.  Dude, everybody knows him.  Are you trying to tell me something, Eric?  Maybe this is the route you should be going.  More nudity?  The Adam Levine route.  Yeah, I mean, but the thing is though, all his clothes...  You got the tattoos, just pose.  But here's the problem.  Here's the problem.  You're small.  I'm afraid.  But my body's horrifying.  Horrifying.  I mean, it's like...  It looks like...  It's Roswellian.  It looks like something that landed in Roswell that the government won't tell you about. 
[03:29:00]  They can paint in apps.  It's even that shade of green, that sickly sort of...  It's the whole thing.  A black and white photo.  But look how thin you wear, though.  You can fit into those small little snuggie pants.  You can pull it off.  Can you get me a pair of snuggie pants?  Yeah.  Okay.  Because Adam Levine, they have these new cool black pants.  Unfortunately, I can't wear them, but you can fit into them.  Can you get me some Adam Levine clothes?  Yeah.  Adam Levine's doing very well.  He's got the voice.  Yeah.  Maybe the voice will be like, oh, I keep hearing about this guy that dresses well on SiriusXM. 
[03:29:30]  We should get him on our show.  Or when you walk by, you go, damn, that looks good.  Yeah, it's your clothes.  I need a stylist.  Can we help you?  A formal stylist.  No more jeans and t-shirts.  No more.  He can help you out.  Eric, are you with me?  You getting down on this bandwagon, too?  I'm the one who's telling you to go do it.  No.  You and me.  Are we dressing up together?  I can't wear Adam Levine clothing.  You don't think so?  I wouldn't fit in that.  What about, like, a nice husky suit?  That's horrible. 
[03:30:00]  You wouldn't wear one of those?  No.  Okay.  If Louie Anderson has a clothing line, I'm in.  I might as well wear LL Bean.  That'd be perfect for you.  Roland in the giant Louie Anderson bathing suit from the diving show.  And every time I fall, I just go, eh.  You should get one of those.  Because every time Roland goes swimming, he wears a t-shirt.  You should get one of those full-body Louie Anderson bathing suits.  Wet suits.  Ooh.  That'd be nice.  What does Eric in New Orleans think? 
[03:30:30]  Eric.  Hey, good morning, guys.  How are you?  Sam, what you need is you need John Barvatos to design you an outfit like Howard's and always  wear a scarf.  I don't know.  Because I've got to tell you the truth.  All due respect to Howard Stern.  You look old.  He never, to me, like, he always looks put together, but he never looks that cool.  Like, he was wearing, like, baggy cargo pants way after those things were cool.  Like, way after. 
[03:31:00]  And, I mean, his clothes always look like they fit properly.  He doesn't look bad.  But he never, like, you never stop and go, now that's a well-dressed guy.  The suit's not making him look, like, amazing.  It doesn't, does it?  It's just like, okay.  He looks good, but he just looks like a guy wearing a nice suit.  It looks like his clothes fit him.  It doesn't stop me and go, that's somebody I should pay attention to.  He's not making the man.  That's exactly right.  That's exactly right.  And, obviously, I don't have a lot going on for myself, so I need a suit to make the man.  Or just wear, like, the, like, the Levee line. 
[03:31:30]  It's all about the details.  You're all about this, Adam Levee line.  Are you getting some out of this?  No, no, zero.  I got shirt from it, and let me say, it's the fucking softest shirt I have ever worn.  A little tight, though?  Yeah.  A little tight.  I gotta lose a little.  Brian in North Carolina.  Uh, yeah, those of the Beastie Boys, the song, Three the Hard Way, talking about how he shopped a Modell.  There you go, Roland.  Three the Hard Way.  Next time somebody tells you you're an asshole for wearing Modells to work, just look at him and say, 
[03:32:00]  No sleep till Brooklyn, bitch.  Okay.  No sleep till Brooklyn, bitch.  Good for you, Roland.  That's what you always tell me every day.  Way to stand up for yourself.  Well, I think you look like an asshole.  But, what do you respond with?  No sleep till Brooklyn, bitch.  Good.  Don't fuck, siss me.  That's not right.  You've been watching too much BET.  Murph in Nebraska.  Sam A!  What's up, buddy?  Hey, bow tie or no tie, my man?  You think?  Bow tie or no tie?  It's all about the bow tie.  I don't even know how to tie a bow tie. 
[03:32:30]  Doctor Who wears a bow tie.  You gotta join the bow tie revolution.  Google it.  I know bow ties are really big right now.  I wear clip-ons, bow ties.  No, you don't wear a fucking clip-on.  You're never gonna catch me in a clip-on tie.  What am I, a dick?  Sometimes.  No.  No is the answer.  No.  You can't wear a clip-on bow tie.  Would you wear a clip-on bow tie?  I wore a clip-on tie before, yeah.  Step it up, buddy.  Step it up.  I don't know how to do the tie.  You're a grown-up.  Do you have a clip-on tie at Sam's wedding?  No.  No.  Kenny did my tie. 
[03:33:00]  Oh.  Club Soda Kenny tied your tie for my wedding?  Yeah.  He took me to the bathroom to tie my tie.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Have you no pride?  No.  You know what I did?  I never knew how to tie a tie.  It was very nice, though.  But when I was like 26, probably, I looked up on YouTube how to tie a tie, and there's  these great videos.  I did that, and I spent all night, and I said, fuck it.  You just gotta do it like a few times, and then eventually you get the hang of it.  You gotta be able to tie your own tie, Roland.  I can't do it, then I just email Kenny and go, can you help me? 
[03:33:30]  You're like 30, right?  Yeah, 33.  Yeah, yeah.  You're 33, Roland.  You gotta be able to put on a nice suit when you need to, and you gotta be able to do  it yourself.  A 33-year-old man cannot look at a man like Club Soda Kenny.  You know how close a man has to be to you to tie your tie for you?  Do you know why God made it that way?  Because it's supposed to be embarrassing.  Or, when I go to a store, I go, hey, I like that tie.  Oh, would you like to buy it?  I go, well, if you tie for me, I'll buy it. 
[03:34:00]  Are you the guy who has the store tie it, and then you just loosen it just enough to  fit your head through so it's always tied?  That's the way I do.  Oh, boy.  You gotta make sure your head doesn't get any bigger, though, because that hole keeps getting  bigger, doesn't it?  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  But I go back.  But you know that ruins ties.  But then I go back, hey.  I bought this tie.  I bought this here.  I need you to tie it for me.  It's like free refills.  It is.  And they go, no.  I go, okay, I'll Twitter your asshole. 
[03:34:30]  I'll Twitter your asshole?  You have photos of their assholes?  No, they're assholes if they don't help me.  Yes, I will buy this tie from you, but first, I need a photo of your asshole.  So just in case, you come back and do not tie my tie for me, I can tweet it.  That's what happens.  You drive a hard bargain.  Kevin in New York.  Hey, Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  Maybe you just need a nice suit jacket and one of them big, giant, oversized turtlenecks.  And that way you can just kind of pull it right up around your ears. 
[03:35:00]  That would be fucking horrible.  Can you imagine?  No, you put a tie on with it, too.  Around the turtleneck?  Yeah, right around the turtleneck.  It'd be cool.  I don't know.  This isn't your friend, Kevin.  No.  No, this guy doesn't sound quite as fashionable.  No, no, no.  You're not turtley enough.  No, Kevin's traveling so now that's him.  You don't want to step up your fashion game ever, Eric?  Oh, I do.  I just can't right now.  Oh, I see, because you're not at a size that you like.  Yeah.  You have to wait until you're at the ideal size.  Yeah.  And then, boom, you're going to go crazy. 
[03:35:30]  Yeah, because most of the nicer clothes are for a slimmer gentleman.  Have you seen how fucking skinny my chinos are?  Mm-hmm.  You've got to have tiny little legs to fit into these things.  Well, I wouldn't wear those, but...  Why not?  They just don't look like they would be good on me.  Not for you?  No.  It's all right.  Yeah, our body style doesn't fit your body style.  Like, what you could wear to get away with?  Mm-hmm.  What do you want to get murdered for?  It's a different deal, huh?  Oh, it'd be bad.  Yeah.  For you, oh, if someone had a good day for us, it'd be a bad day. 
[03:36:00]  Isn't there any time, though, when you're sitting there rolling and saying,  I have to interact with publicists, I have to interact with celebrities.  Like, you see celebrities come in here.  Yeah.  They look great.  Yeah.  You know, these celebrities, obviously they have people around them, and they have people  dressing them and all this stuff.  Yeah.  But celebrities come in here, and they look good, and they smell good, and they carry themselves  like a celebrity.  Yeah.  Don't you think that part of that whole deal is, even if you don't have the celebrity  part, if you can carry yourself like a celebrity, if you can dress well, if you can come in 
[03:36:30]  here with some confidence and act like you're somebody, isn't that half the battle?  Yes and no.  Like a CeeLo.  Some of the shit he wears, like, come on, dude.  Well, CeeLo, luckily, CeeLo's the other side.  He's like, I'm just gonna get famous.  Yeah.  Like, super famous, and then I'll dress fucking crazy.  Yeah.  What you can't do is have the dress fucking crazy part, and then the not a celebrity.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  You can have the not a celebrity, or you can have the dress crazy, but you can't have those  two halves together.  That's what you have going on right now. 
[03:37:00]  Yeah, but then they always remember you.  I guess.  But not for good reasons.  Oh, that's that guy who wears basketball shorts every day.  Yeah, they love it.  You don't want to tie a tie?  I did not have to wear a tie once I worked in the entertainment industry.  That's like, out of the window.  You don't want to?  No.  All right.  I can respect that.  That's like the entertainment industry.  You don't have to wear a tie.  It's true.  It's true.  Even guys who are supposed to wear ties have the shirt unbuttoned, you know, one or two  down while they're wearing the full suit. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah, the higher collar look.  But that's all right.  If you have, like, you know, the first button's unbuttoned and the tie's a little loose,  it still looks a little casual.  No tie at all.  Oh.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Everything minus the tie.  Yeah, the Clooney does that.  The one button tie.  Tie thing.  It looks cool.  He's Clooney.  He's the man.  Right.  And I'm saying, if I can dress a little more like Clooney, maybe people will mistakenly  think I'm the man.  You don't think so?  He has a pocketbook.  Yeah.  He has a deep pocketbook.  Well, here's the other big problem.  That if I decided to make this change, literally all the money in the world that I have would 
[03:38:00]  have to go to clothes because they're expensive.  And custom fit.  Yeah.  You have to get them custom fit, right?  Yeah, you can't just buy off the rack if you want to go that far.  Yeah, because if you come in and you're wearing like nice clothes that don't fit you, you  look like an intern on his first day.  Specifically the one we have now.  Is that your dad's suit?  Yeah, exactly.  You might as well just go back to Modell's at that point.  That's true.  I'd rather see you in Modell's than in an ill-fitting suit.  I have a message for you from Mr. Dapper, Dennis Falcone. 
[03:38:30]  He thinks that your wardrobe needs to be sponsored and we should have a Dress Sam for Success  promotion.  First of all, does everything have to be a goddamn alliteration with that guy?  Yep.  Look, if somebody will buy me stuff, I'm all for it.  I'll say whatever you want on this microphone.  I still hope Modell sponsors you.  Not Modell's.  I don't want anything from Modell's.  Gary in New York. 
[03:39:00]  I think before you start wearing suits for success, you're going to have to straighten  that shambogie hair of yours.  No, that's the whole thing.  First of all, I think it's horrible.  Maybe join a gym so you don't look so sickly.  Shambogie sounds racist.  I don't know if it is, but I don't appreciate it.  And it's not going to fly on this show.  And second of all, that's the whole point.  Oh, he's the guy who's wearing like a nice suit, but has crazy hair.  Let's pay attention.  That's what gets people to open their eyes.  Oh, let's pay attention.  I'm not trying to fit in.  You know, I'm trying to stand out in the most positive way. 
[03:39:30]  Look at the Casavarro's.  Everybody had suits on, and then the girls saw your hair.  And that went to you?  You know what happened today?  What was her name from Breaking Bad?  Marie.  Betsy Brett.  Right.  Betsy.  You should have seen her in here.  She's taking photos with everybody during the commercial break.  And she looks at me, and she goes, I like what you have going on.  And I went in for the picture.  She had her hands in my hair.  Girls love it.  Like, I want everybody out there to know.  Every fucking actress plays with your hair. 
[03:40:00]  Thank you, Roller.  Rose Byrne.  Everybody.  Yeah.  They all go, can't just, can't just, and you're like, go ahead.  And it's not like old actresses.  No.  It's Rose Byrne.  It's hot actresses.  And that chick from Arrow.  Willow.  Willow Ford.  It's on YouTube.  It's on my YouTube channel.  You can look that up.  She's ridiculous.  That's why, when I, if I look at an Instagram comment, and there are men criticizing my hair,  my facial structure, it's never bothered me. 
[03:40:30]  Because I'm okay with the fact that you guys who listen to the show might not want to date me.  That makes it, I'm okay with that.  When you get actresses coming in here and being like, I like this.  I go, okay, well, I like you, baby.  It was Stacey Keebler.  Stacey Keebler.  Exactly.  When you got Stacey Keebler being like, yeah, you got something going on.  You don't really, you don't, you don't fuck with the haters, do you, Rowan?  Fuck the haters.  That's exactly right.  That's what Dean Norris says.  Fuck them all.  Jack in Texas. 
[03:41:00]  Hey, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  First of all, why does your call screener sound like he's underwater when he's talking?  Hey, is, is, is Tyler underwater in there?  No.  He's, he's upright.  Is he drinking water?  No.  Maybe there's just water in his lungs.  I think it's just a bad phone connection.  Waterboard him if you can.  Go on.  Hey, Sam, if you're going to shoot for success, maybe you ought to catch a cold again because  your voice sounded very baritone and very normal.  It sounded great.  Well, I don't want normal.  I want good.  Oh, it sounded great. 
[03:41:30]  It sounded great?  It did.  It sounded great.  Yeah.  Is there anything, maybe I should start, that's what I should do.  I'll get a new wardrobe, right?  And then I'll just start drinking whiskey and smoking cigarettes every day.  That's badass.  And have one of those badass, old school.  Like Jon Hamm, Mad Men.  Exactly.  Starts smacking chicks in the ass.  Exactly.  Go ask for steak for lunch.  I love watching Mad Men because in the beginning, like the first couple seasons, first four  seasons really, everybody on that show is looking cool.  Like they all have their like 1950s suits on. 
[03:42:00]  They're all looking pretty badass.  Like late 50s, early 60s.  Now on the show, if you're still watching it, they're starting to drift towards the late  60s into the 70s.  And they all look like assholes now.  Like they're all like...  Checkered pants.  Yeah.  They have checkered pants.  And horrible turtlenecks.  Sideburns are starting to pop up.  And the hair is getting longer and poofier.  If you want a nice suit?  Yeah.  Harvey from Suits.  Okay.  Enough with about Suits.  Why?  Suits is the best show.  I can't believe it took you this long that we were talking about Suits to mention the  show Suits.  No, he was trying to work it in. 
[03:42:30]  I was trying to work it in.  Yeah, exactly.  I was for you to trash me.  And what happened?  Well, Harvey's a badass.  He's better than Jon Hamm in Suits.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yes.  Suits is better.  Suits is better than Mad Men.  Yes.  Get the fuck out of here.  Suits is way better than Mad Men.  Shut up.  You shut up.  That is an insane comment.  Isn't that insane?  Nobody watches Suits.  Right there.  Peter Travers.  Suits is better than Mad Men.  Who said that?  I did.  That's what I thought.  Don't quote.  Don't give your quotes to Peter Travers. 
[03:43:00]  He never said that.  I know.  How many awards has Suits won?  Six.  I hope.  I don't mean Rolando's Awards.  Oh.  Rolando's Awards for Outstanding Television.  It's an awesome show.  What's up, Steve?  Samuel, how you doing, pal?  Good.  Hey, I think that if you're going with a tie, you should go with a skinny tie because you're  a slight of frame man.  Well, here's what happens.  Because I'm so slight of frame, I put on skinny ties and they still look like giant bozo the 
[03:43:30]  clown ties.  So I have to, like, as skinny as you can get, like dental floss.  Well, you're queer then.  And so, anyway, what I also...  That's not true.  Well, that's fine.  But I've never seen a picture of Jeff, so I don't know about that.  Either way...  Just banging.  Banging.  It's on my Facebook Instagram right now.  All right.  Well, either way, I've never seen you with your shirt off and I feel like you have one  of those checks that look like...  This is exactly...  I'm hanging up on you right now.  This is exactly what I'm talking about.  He's going in the same category as anyone who's commented about the looks on Instagram 
[03:44:00]  of anybody on staff.  Like, why is Steve in Philadelphia worried about what I look like with my shirt off?  Yeah, if you follow me at Rolando's 99, I'll post a picture of Jeff today.  No, you won't.  They don't know.  I just wanted to...  Jim in California.  Sammy, how you doing, buddy?  Great.  Look, you're going to be a star regardless of what you look like.  You got your own thing going on, so I change it. 
[03:44:30]  You're right.  I don't know if the WWE has jumped all over you with the chemistry you got with Josh Matthews  and that other geek, what is his name?  Yeah, but you know what?  You turn on WWE television, what's every broadcaster wearing?  You don't need all that, though.  You're a standout on your own.  Thank you, Jim.  I appreciate the compliment.  Great.  Perfect call.  Perfect call.  Now, Roland, I've been meaning to talk about this because we've had stuff going on on 
[03:45:00]  the after show and all this stuff, but we haven't talked about...  You went to see Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake when they were at Yankee Stadium, right?  Yes.  I swear to God.  Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake are probably maybe the two...  I guess they're not the two biggest touring acts because the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney  are still touring.  Bruce.  Bruce.  Bruce is bigger, but I mean...  They're the top five.  And in terms of contemporary pop music, stuff that you're going to hear on like a top 40  radio station...  They're the top ones. 
[03:45:30]  There's nobody bigger than those two.  So they've teamed up and they're doing a stadium tour.  They did Yankee Stadium a week or two ago.  And I got to tell you, it is nice having friends who work at Yankee Stadium.  Does she want her...  Is she okay if we say what her name is?  First name.  Yeah, we'll see.  Yeah.  Yeah, because Debbie's the best.  Debbie is unbelievable.  We get to Yankee Stadium and this is a legit sellout.  And that's what's amazing about this show.  Like, Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z are doing two nights at Yankee Stadium and it's a legit 
[03:46:00]  sellout.  Okay?  And we went there and we saw it.  There's not a seat to be had.  Debbie, who works at the stadium and is a big fan of the show, she treats Roland and  me like we're kings.  Does she treat you as well as she treated me?  Yeah, she loves me.  She does.  She's the best.  She took us down.  I was there with Jess.  And Jess was so impressed.  She was like, finally, you have some real connections.  She took us down.  We got into the stadium. 
[03:46:30]  Parking.  No problem.  We go.  They have this giant, like, I guess it's a restaurant.  Can people pay to eat there?  No.  It's just for, like, friends and family type thing?  I don't know.  But it's, you don't know.  They're just like, it's this mysterious, wonderful, it's like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory except  for dinner.  Because it's as much food, it's all you can eat and there's no bill.  So I'm sitting there eating, like, half-roasted chickens.  They got a ridiculous salad bar.  They got a ridiculous dessert bar.  They got hot dogs being made so they still have that, you know, stadium feel. 
[03:47:00]  But we have this awesome dinner.  We go upstairs.  And I figure that, oh, they must have, like, a press section that Debbie's going to sit  us in.  You know, like, you know, that they just sit, like, everybody who's covering stuff for press,  you sit here.  And Sam and Jess will just stand you up next to them and you'll be good.  And that's good enough for me.  I'm like, yeah.  Just to see the show is incredible.  But Roland, she has a private, like, a box, a box box that's just for, like, two people. 
[03:47:30]  Yeah.  Like, it's this time.  And you get to sit there and it's air-conditioned.  You open up the windows so you can feel the heat.  But then you just sit back and the air condition's blasting.  We get to watch the show from a box.  And it was like, I felt like royalty.  It was amazing what Debbie did for us.  I don't know what kind of entertainment value we've provided her that would allow us that,  but whatever.  I mean, if you're enjoying this, then please, Debbie, keep enjoying it. 
[03:48:00]  But the thing that I found, you saw, that was, when you saw him, was it your first time  seeing Jay-Z live?  Yeah, I never, I never wanted to see him.  Why not?  Because I never liked, never, I expected him, but I never liked the music.  It wasn't my taste.  Yeah, you're not a hip-hop guy.  Yeah.  And rappers are notoriously horrible live.  I mean, I, terrible.  For some reason, rap almost always does not translate live.  They're good in the studio, but they can't, I guess they must do like take after take after 
[03:48:30]  take, because when they're live, they're terrible, except Jay-Z.  I mean, everybody knows what a ridiculous Rob Zombie fan I am by now.  I have his autograph and his logo tattooed on my arm.  Everybody knows what a ridiculous Jack White fan I am.  I have his autograph tattooed on my arm.  It was covered on RollingStone.com.  Of course, Rolling Stone said, Jack White signs a fan's arm.  Yeah.  It's like, come on.  I got kind of a show business job. 
[03:49:00]  You can't give a little plug to the show.  You can't mention I work in radio.  I have to be some idiot who just found him on the street?  That's you.  That's me, isn't it?  The moron.  So, and those are two guys that do amazing stage shows.  Like Rob Zombie's stage show is ridiculous, because he has all of a sudden, there's dancing  robots coming across the stage, and he's jumping up in the air and jumping from tombstone to  tombstone, and there's smoke, and there's fire, and it's like you're in a demonic world  of awesomeness.  And then Jack White is like one of the most incredible artists you'll ever see live. 
[03:49:30]  He doesn't play with a set list.  He just goes, unless you go to Radio City Music Hall, in which case he does like 45  minutes and then walks off the stage.  But beyond that show, which thank God I didn't go to, he does these amazing shows.  But I don't know.  I think it's just a thing.  And I think everybody probably has an artist that this applies to them with.  But when I go to a Jay-Z show, and it's not like he's talking about selling crack on  the streets.  It's not exactly a world that I'm 100% familiar with.  I didn't exactly grow up around crack dealers in Brooklyn, but for some reason, that becomes 
[03:50:00]  like a religious experience for me.  He brought the house down.  He did.  And every show, it's like the fifth time I've seen him live.  And I realized at the Yankee Stadium show, and it wasn't just that we got hooked up so  crazy.  There's nobody else that I would rather see live than Jay-Z.  I love the Holy Grail.  He's doing Holy Grail.  He's got so many hits.  He's been making hits since 96, so if you like his music, it's just hit after hit after 
[03:50:30]  hit.  But there's just that sort of, I don't know, factor about going to a show where it's just  an artist you connect with, and it's like you're going to church.  I mean, it gets scary at times.  I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, because Jay-Z puts up a diamond sign in  the air with his hands.  The hova.  And then people, he tells, okay, everybody put them up and put them down.  And so it's basically, you're bowing to him.  You know, like you're, like, it looks like people are in a position of worship, and you 
[03:51:00]  look around, and for, like, I got scared.  I had to step back and go, what am I into here?  Like, what am I supporting?  Because I look around, and it is a frightening thing to see a stadium full of people, all in  unison, just bowing to one guy and making a hand symbol.  It's like Bono says in concert, once the artists and the fans click, it's a rollercoaster  for everybody.  It's like, that's right.  And it is crazy, because the fans and Jay-Z click, but now, I guess he, I mean, he does 
[03:51:30]  the same show throughout his tour.  Like, there's not that much that gets changed up, I don't think.  I'm like zero.  Because he knows, like, okay, this is the thing that works, and I can have a stadium's  attention for, like, two hours at a time.  But, is that, do you feel like, when you go see Bruce, that that's like, is that what  it is for you?  Is that your religious experience?  Yeah, because it's...  I swear to God, I like, the feelings that I was having, watching this Jay-Z concert,  like, I was in church. 
[03:52:00]  Like, I was like, this is my spirituality.  It is, that's what it is.  Like they said, part rock and roll concert, part church.  Yeah.  Part circus.  Yeah.  You have a great time.  That's what all Bruce shows are.  That's what it is for Bruce.  Bruce, like, well, they did three hours, too.  Yeah.  Three, four hour shows.  And it's like, for, like, in that moment, you're just there with that dude on stage,  and it's the whole arena, stadium, whatever Bruce is doing, everybody is there as like  one body.  You went through the Prudential Center?  Yeah.  And it does happen with Bruce, where this whole body of people becomes one thing. 
[03:52:30]  Yeah.  And they're all attached to that one dude on stage.  And you saw Jay-Z, it's the same thing.  And Jay-Z is like, not like that, not like that.  Because he's just, come on, come on.  And Jay-Z doesn't have to say nothing.  He just looks up in the air, and everybody's like, wah!  Jay-Z is not dancing.  No.  He's not playing any instruments.  He's just standing there with a microphone.  And he's got just everybody in unison being like, yeah, whatever you say, we will do, 
[03:53:00]  at this moment, we'll do anything that you say.  And he chops at Modell's with Brooklyn Nets stuff.  I don't know if he actually does that.  He hopes that you chop at Modell's.  I buy his stuff.  Eric, do you have, is there any artist for you that when you go to their shows, it's  like, you don't, you're not thinking about, okay, what's technically a better show?  Because, sure, musically, Jack White is, of course, a better live performer than Jay-Z.  But there's just that sort of undeniable thing that happens where it becomes a religious experience. 
[03:53:30]  Is there any artist for you that's like, I'll see them live anytime, as often as possible,  and I'm just in this world when I'm there?  Billy Joel.  Really?  Yep.  You're that big of a Billy Joel fan?  Mm-hmm.  How many times have you seen him?  Um, I think only four.  But every time I went, it was just, like, amazing.  And you're just in that world with him?  Yep.  Like, it's embarrassing for me.  When I go to, when I go to Jay-Z shows, I'm screaming the words to every single song. 
[03:54:00]  And, like, I don't even take notice of who's around me at that point.  Because I'm there in this, but do you, like, Roland, I've been to shows with you.  You're a different concert goer.  I observe.  You just sit, stand there quietly.  Yeah, I observe the moments.  And I'm looking at, like, we went to Bruce together, and Roland is, like, this super  Bruce fan, and he's just sitting there, and just standing in a pit, because we didn't  have seats, we were in the pit.  Yeah.  Roland's just standing there, just kind of staring at the stage. 
[03:54:30]  And I go, like, is he having fun?  And we get out of the show, and Roland goes, that was one of the best times I've ever had  at a Bruce show.  Yeah.  And I go, he's got a totally different, what's your, Eric, what's your concert going experience?  I agree with Roland in the sense of, like, if I went to see Billy Joel,  I'd probably be doing the same thing, just staring at the stage, not wanting to participate,  because I want to take in everything that's going on there.  You don't sing along.  But then there's other concerts that I've gone to where I'm not that involved with the  artist, but I'll have a good time and sing along or whatever. 
[03:55:00]  No, but I mean, when you're there connected, you're not singing along.  No, I don't want to, you know, be fucking around and then miss something that they said  or did on the stage.  That's so weird, because I can't help myself.  And it's probably obnoxious to the people around me.  No, there's a lot of people who do that.  Yeah.  It's just a different thing.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number.  That's how Beyonce and Rosalind, they put a ring on it.  I'm like, yeah, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.  That's probably not the religious experience that I was talking about.  No, that was the religious experience. 
[03:55:30]  You just felt like a single lady in the moment.  It was a fun show.  I'd never seen her before.  Chris in Florida.  What's up, guys?  Um, you were talking about the Jay-Z concert and how everybody was going to look like they  were bowing to Jay-Z.  Um, it reminded me, um, we just had, um, some of our relatives come in town, and they're  super religious.  And they brought out this video while we're all sitting around explaining how Jay-Z and  Beyonce are devil worshippers.  I've seen that.  There are people who think that Jay-Z is either, uh, like, the head of a, the head 
[03:56:00]  of a, like, the member of a New World Order Illuminati secret society of devil worshippers  that's trying to, like, get, and I'm, I'm going to tell you, for a second, at that show,  there's, like, a red light shining on the crowd, and everybody's just bowing to him and  making hand symbols.  It is, like, like, it looks like a youth rally.  Like, it's scary for a second, but then you're like, fuck it.  I'm here.  I'm in.  I'm with you guys.  I say, if they're so worried, step up their game and put in a better show. 
[03:56:30]  Yeah, exactly.  If any of the Christian rock groups want to, you know, shit.  If fuck them, they'll have to, I mean, I'll worship the devil.  Like, if it's a good show, I'll pay the money.  If it's a good show, you don't mind worshipping Satan.  Yeah, it's a good show.  Oh, I mean, I don't think, I think Jay-Z worships money, not the devil.  No, he worships, like, his management company.  Yeah.  Uh, Jason in Detroit.  Hey, guys.  Hey, uh, before I make this statement, I am going to go see this guy tonight.  But E-Rock, no Weird Al?  Weird Al's not number one? 
[03:57:00]  He's not the guy?  No, Weird Al's one of those concerts that you'd have a good time at.  You wouldn't just zone out and concentrate on everything that you're taking in.  But when you're at a Billy Joel show, you feel like you're at church.  Yeah.  It's amazing, isn't it?  Yeah, and it's the only one, I think, too.  Maybe Neil Diamond, but I think it's just Billy Joel.  I've talked to Billy Joel, like, at the Garden three times, it's a different set list to each guy.  And you're not even arguing whether Billy Joel is better than Neil Diamond or not.  It's just a matter of, like, when I'm there.  You're focused.  I'm connected.  Yeah.  Uh, John in Chicago. 
[03:57:30]  Yeah, Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  If you haven't seen Tech Nine in concert out of Kansas City, Missouri, he is the best.  I think Tech Nine's playing at the Gathering of the Juggalos that Troy and me are going to.  Nice.  Yes.  Yes.  He sounds, on concert, he sounds just like if you put in a CD.  That's pretty good.  And he gets the crowd right in there with it.  That's awesome.  Thanks, buddy.  Scrambler.  Hey, Sammy.  I like to kind of play this game with myself when I'm listening to live albums. 
[03:58:00]  Like, if I could have been.  And to me, the two are Alice in Chains Unplugged and the Jay-Z Unplugged on MTV when the Roots  was there with, like, a 15-piece band.  Yeah.  I would, when I listen to that, I am in another world.  I'm singing along to all, even the songs that I don't like as much.  But, man, when those two albums or those two performances, I'd give anything to be in that  little 100-person arena watching those two shows. 
[03:58:30]  Yeah, the Jay-Z, thanks, buddy.  The Jay-Z Unplugged doesn't get enough credit.  And now Jay-Z plays with a full band when he's in concert, so it's great.  I could talk about this all day, but we've got to go, unfortunately.  However, good news.  Ron and Fez are coming up next, so stay tuned.  Goodbye, everybody.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over.
