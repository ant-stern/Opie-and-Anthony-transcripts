<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a phone interview with comedian Bill Burr.  Burr recounted humorous travel anecdotes from Europe, including a story about a smelly Frenchman on a plane, and shared his experiences at a Premier League soccer game. He also promoted his upcoming comedy special and his participation in the Patrice O'Neill Comedy Benefit, providing details about participating comedians and ticket information.

Following Burr’s call, the hosts launched into a discussion about "cuddle houses," focusing on a recently shut-down Wisconsin establishment.  The conversation quickly devolved into graphic sexual innuendo and descriptions, incorporating audio clips and caller anecdotes, one of which involved a man masturbating on the BQE after a woman ended their intimacy.

The show then shifted to a discussion about a school's strict policy against teacher gifts during the holidays, sparking a profane rant from the hosts about the perceived naiveté of young teachers.  This segued into nostalgic childhood holiday memories, including anecdotes about Valentine's Day cards, Thanksgiving crafts, and classroom grab bags.  A prank involving a package sent to a coworker, Eric, and opened by Denny, a show staffer, was recounted in detail, alongside Denny’s past suspension for an inaccurate snow day announcement.  The discussion touched on Christmas music preferences, including a digression on a listener's questionable musical taste and a brief call from Jim Norton promoting his shows.

A lengthy phone call with a listener named "Lady Di" ensued, characterized by rambling conversation and a bizarre lack of knowledge about Nelson Mandela. The hosts attempted to set her up with a male listener, Mike Buschetti, resulting in a sexually suggestive exchange focused on Lady Di's drinking habits and a past in-studio incident involving her bodily fluids.  The hosts expressed relief at the end of the call, making plans for their year-end show.

The next segment began with the hosts discussing a frustrating and dishonest phone call with a previous guest, devising a future prank involving absurd questions.  This transitioned into a series of commercials, promoting various products and services including Tom Papa's SiriusXM show, R. Kelly's performance, Neat, Southern Energy Group, Rosetta Stone, and New Relic.  The hosts then dissected their recent SiriusXM "winter holiday gathering," criticizing the cold catering and the incongruity of a "no Christmas mention" party with Christmas decorations and music. The ping-pong tournament at the party was discussed, along with confusion over its rules.

A substantial portion of the show centered on Dennis Falcone's behavior at the party.  The hosts detailed allegations of sexually suggestive comments and actions directed at female colleagues, including a request for a female employee to photocopy her backside. Falcone was brought on air to defend himself, attributing his actions to jokes and referencing comedians like Don Rickles.  Other staff members, including Roland, offered differing perspectives, leading to a confrontational exchange.  Roland also criticized the party's catering.

The fallout from the party continued into the next segment, with additional accounts from a caller, Lauren, and other employees like Eric and Roland corroborating certain aspects of Falcone's alleged behavior. Falcone continued to deny and downplay many of the accusations, attributing some to intoxication.  The conversation was punctuated by frequent interruptions and humorous asides, including references to mistletoe belt buckles and *Mad Men*.  Commercial breaks featured ads for Viagra, tax services, website builders, movies, and dating sites.  Later in the segment, calls with Colin Quinn and Lady Di were interspersed with further discussion about Falcone’s actions, followed by a conversation with Tom Papa and Godfrey on Tom Papa’s SiriusXM show.

A significant portion of the show featured comedian Godfrey as a guest. He discussed his early career in Chicago, his experiences working with prominent figures in Black comedy (Bernie Mac, Sinbad, Jamie Foxx, Steve Harvey), and the challenges faced by Black comedians. He highlighted his mentorship under Bernie Mac, his experiences auditioning for acting roles, and his unsuccessful Saturday Night Live auditions.

The broadcast concluded with a commercial for Instaflex, repeatedly mentioning  "We're the one selling joint," and a brief mention of fantasy football playoffs and Adrian Peterson.

[00:02:30]  Bill Burr.  Billy.  What's going on?  Hey, Bill.  What's your thoughts on Dream Theater?  You know, they're all very adept at their instruments, but I don't like any of their songs.  Yeah, I never liked Dream Theater.  But we got the Dream Theater fans, you know, yelling and screaming at us because we kind  of took our, I don't know, our monthly shot at them.  I never liked them.  It's a terrible, first of all, it's a terrible name. 
[00:03:00]  Dream Theater, right.  It sounds like an organization raising money for some cars you don't care about.  I was just in England and Man United, their soccer team, their football club, the name  of their stadium, they call it the Theater of Dreams.  Oh, wow.  That's pretty cool.  Oh, man. 
[00:03:30]  I just figured I'd throw those deuce chills at you this early Monday morning.  Yeah, that's a little rough.  How's Dublin?  Yeah.  How's Dublin?  Dublin is great.  I just landed here.  It was a sunny day.  Came in from 8th row.  There was no delays.  I was excited.  Jimmy Norton, I heard your name a lot all weekend in London.  Oh, really?  They were right on the show.  And they're like, tell that little cunt to come over here.  I want to see his comedy.  All right.  Maybe I will. 
[00:04:00]  Maybe I will.  You should.  You should.  I'm going to release my...  You know what I'm going to do?  I'm releasing my special on my website shortly since Comedy Central just refuses to budge  on their terms.  So I'm just going to do it on my website and hopefully get some international play there  and then I'll see where I can go.  If you guys want me, you buy the special, I'll know you want me to go there.  Yeah, that'd be a great excuse for me to go.  Play a little hardcore.  I like it.  No, but I mean, you know what I'm saying?  It's like you don't know people want you.  If you could track where they're buying your stuff from, you'd go, oh, okay, I do have  fans there.  Right. 
[00:04:30]  Bill, I was listening to...  I was just saying, I was there.  I was there and they want you to.  And they want you.  All right.  Thanks, brother.  I was listening to your podcast yesterday and you were on one of those double-decker planes.  Oh, yeah.  I've never been on a double-decker plane.  It was that 8300 or whatever.  The one that had two floors.  Wow.  Have you guys ever been on the double-decker plane?  No, never.  They international flights, yeah.  I use all my miles up for the next 20 years to get on this thing. 
[00:05:00]  Really?  Yeah, so me and my wife get on the thing and we're both walking in there totally betraying  the fact that it's our first time on a great plane like that.  We look like total tourists.  Like, oh, my God, look at this thing.  This is awesome.  Right?  So we're excited.  Like, you know, it's a long-ass flight for, you know, you're going to pony up the money,  right?  All of a sudden, I just smell this fucking smell. 
[00:05:30]  And I was like, you've got to be kidding me.  And it was this French dude, just every stereotype of a French dude.  Oh, no.  And he knows, I swear to God, he's putting his luggage in the overhead rack and immediately  this paradise smelled like a New York City cap.  Oh, you fucking piece of shit.  Oh, that fig is fucking up your good time.  Oh, it was horrific.  So, Nia had the window and I had the aisle and he had the aisle, so I'm right next to 
[00:06:00]  this guy.  And when he put his arms down, it was fine.  But I swear to God, anytime he would lean forward and reach for a magazine, I would smell it.  So now, of course, I have Tourette's and I'm trying to get me to calm down.  And so he finally smelled it, but it wasn't that bad.  It was sort of the beginning of the flight when he was getting adjusted and at the end  of the flight when he was getting all his stuff off.  It was, to be fair to the French, I've met plenty of French people and they don't smell 
[00:06:30]  like that.  But this guy was every stereotype.  Oh, God.  That sounds awful.  Wait, were you in business first?  I don't know what they called it, because I used all the miles.  It was hilarious, because when I got my ticket, it said I was row 65A.  And I'm like, what the fuck?  I'm like, we upgraded.  I don't fuck am I in row 65, but the 60s are the first rows upstairs. 
[00:07:00]  So it was great.  So, yeah, your feet went down into a bed.  But still, at the end of the day, you are sleeping in a Lazy Boy, which you'd never do  in your home, so it's never going to be as good as a bed.  It's way better than when I went to Australia from New York one time, you know, in, like,  coach.  Oh, man.  Yeah, waking up every 20 minutes, playing a little Tetris, and then falling asleep again.  My neck is fucking killing me.  Oh, that sounds horrendous.  What airline were you on? 
[00:07:30]  For which flight?  Do you want to use this on this flight?  I think it was Delta.  Believe it or not, I was on Delta.  No, I think the...  It was Charles Biddle.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And you said it was...  I always think that if you're sitting upstairs on a double-decker, it's really special.  But on your podcast, you're like, eh, it's not really that much different than just  being on a regular flight.  You know what I think of this?  I think you're in the old school ones, when you've got to walk up the spiral staircase.  Yeah, the old 747s, yeah. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, when I just picture people up there, there's a bar you can stand next to.  I mean, it's all in my imagination.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  And how does it feel in the air?  Does it feel different at all, or...?  No.  Not really, right?  Does it feel differently?  I don't know if you've ever ridden on a double-decker commuter rail out to Long Island.  All right.  Same shit.  You're right.  You're right.  They are big, though, huh?  I'm really killing a lot of dreams with these phone calls from abroad. 
[00:08:30]  These chapels and shit.  But you're encouraging everyone to go over and check out Europe.  No, no, you've got to do it.  Well, if you go over, don't go to tourist attractions.  Just don't do it.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  The same way you live in New York, you don't go to the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State.  Right.  Or Times Square.  That's what we try to tell the people.  They come to New York and they just hang out in Times Square.  Stupid.  Yeah.  There's so much more shit to check out.  Yeah.  Exactly.  So I went to a Premier League soccer game yesterday. 
[00:09:00]  It was fucking great.  Any hooligans?  I had a good time over here.  I guess they had a little problem with some soccer hooligans.  They were sitting in the night seats like a bunch of cozy, smug cunts.  And what was great was Arsenal scored a goal to go up 1-0.  And they had a fight song about how, I guess back in the day, they used to always go up 1-0.  And then they'd play some suffocating defense.  And you could never get them.  The entire reason why Americans don't watch soccer was basically their game plan. 
[00:09:30]  So they had this huge song that they still sing whenever they go up 1-0.  So there was like two minutes left in the game.  They went up 1-0.  And so the whole fucking stadium starts singing this song.  It gave me like chills, man.  They were going crazy.  It sounded like they won a war.  And as they're in the second horse, the other team scored.  Oh, no shit.  It went deathly fucking quiet.  And in the corner are these maniacs for the other team. 
[00:10:00]  And they let off this smoke bomb of like blue smoke, which you're not supposed to do.  And I got to see the cops run over a little bit.  It was great.  It was a great time.  Have you figured out that soccer thing yet?  I don't understand why America is the only country that's just not in.  The whole world loves soccer.  Yeah, but are you saying the rest of the world is boring?  Yes.  And baseball is also boring.  Dumb.  I think we just have four sports we're already committed to. 
[00:10:30]  And then the hardcore people can actually get into golf or maybe tennis, too.  I just don't think we have room for it.  And then also the way that they've marketed sports.  Yeah.  Once they basically hit that limit where anybody who liked sports was watching.  So then they had to get like Britney Spears to perform halftime.  But it's a combination of that.  And then they also, all the rules are all about offense now and scoring. 
[00:11:00]  So all of our games now, like hockey, the scoring through the roof, baseball, you know, all through the roids, all the old records.  Plus, isn't it that it's hard for them to get commercials in, too, Bill?  The commercials, don't they play for like almost an hour straight or whatever?  So it'll be hard to show commercials during a soccer game.  Yeah, that's what's great, dude.  You're in and out of there in like a fucking hour and 45 minutes.  But that makes it hard for TV.  But what they have on the sidelines, they have on the sidelines, they have like streaming advertising.  But then during halftime, like they say three things and then they just show a bunch of commercials or something. 
[00:11:30]  But that's also why in the uniforms, why they have like United Arab Emirates, whatever.  Yeah, yeah, they put ads on the uniforms, huh?  Yeah, which to me is like sacrilegious.  And I'm like, wait a minute, we stop playing every two seconds for them to show ads.  Yeah, so it doesn't...  Like, look, if you go to England, like I wouldn't, you know, walk by Big Ben in Parliament, but definitely go to a Premier League game and then go to some shitty pub. 
[00:12:00]  And then you'll get more of a feeling of what it's like to be over there instead of, I don't know, fucking driving down to Stonehenge to go look at some rocks.  And go to Piccadilly Circus.  Well, anyway, the reason why I called in here, I didn't call the second annual Patrice O'Neill Comedy Benefits for Family and Survivors of Stroke is going on sale today.  And it goes, the ticket link is going to be live at 11 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. 
[00:12:30]  And we have a, we got a wonderful lineup.  Let me see if I can get to it on my damn phone so I don't...  I got it here, Bill.  I don't forget anybody.  Oh, Jimmy has it.  Obviously, we have the wonderful Jim Norton.  Yay.  Nick DiPaolo, David Tell, Colin Quinn, Dane Cook, Talent, Rich and Bonnie, Keith Robinson, Robert Kelly, Big Jay Orkerson, Harris Stanton, and myself.  That's huge.  Jesus.  We're hoping for a great turnout like last year. 
[00:13:00]  Opie and Anthony, you guys, we're hoping once again, you guys are going to kick it off.  Oh, it'll be great.  Twelve comics.  Holy shit.  February 18th here in New York.  Bill, is it City Center again?  Yeah, it's the City Center.  So the first show's at 12.  I mean, seven, sorry.  Seven.  And, you know, we'll see how that one goes.  If it goes as quick as it did last year, we'll actually try and maybe add another show.  That's why I got so many comics on this thing.  We're hoping maybe to do two, which I probably shouldn't have said because then people will wait for the second one. 
[00:13:30]  Well, you know, just so many people last year, like so many people love Patrice on both ends going,  dude, I couldn't even get tickets or I wanted to be on the show.  And I couldn't, you know, like last year I felt like I forgot to ask Nick DiPaolo.  I threw it together really quick and him and Patrice, I mean, we're really close.  And there's still a bunch of guys that I'm trying to get on and whatever.  Well, I'm doing the best I can, all right?  Whatever.  It's going to be great. 
[00:14:00]  Fuck is all.  I'm doing the best I can.  Tickets go on sale at 11 a.m. this morning.  The link is a little, we'll put the link on our Facebook page.  It doesn't go live until 11 a.m.  So that link I gave you works, but it's not going to come on until 11 a.m.  Yeah, Bill tweeted it.  I retweeted Bill today.  All right, it's on our Twitter and Facebook.  It's basically B-I-T dot L-Y slash Patrice Benefit.  I know.  It's already, it's on our Facebook and our Twitter and all that stuff. 
[00:14:30]  Okay, we got it on our shit, so that's good.  Or BillBurr.com, I'm sure, has the info.  It's going to be a great show, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's going to be an awesome time.  And it's also cool.  It's going to also turn into a cool night to see all your friends,  because I never get to, you know, like Jim, I don't get to work with you  other than when we did the anti-social tour,  so I never get to see you do stand-up.  So, you know, seeing all those guys, Nick DiPaolo, 
[00:15:00]  since I became a big phony plastic man living out there in Hollywood,  I don't get to see all the great New York comics.  So it's kind of a selfish reason why I'm putting this together.  Yeah, it's funny, I don't get to see the guys either do stand-up.  I think the last time you and I did a gig together, Bill, was last year.  Yeah.  Yeah, was the other benefit.  The Patrice benefit, yeah.  I think that was the last time we did something.  And where are you at with your European tour?  You're in Dublin tonight.  Yep, and then Helsinki.  I get past Helsinki, I break the back of this tour.  It's all downhill from there, and then I just blow through the last four. 
[00:15:30]  Helsinki.  Oslo, Stockholm, and then over to Iceland.  Holy crap.  Are you working in Reykjavik, Bill?  Yep.  That's where Fisher won the world title, from Helsinki.  Bill's all over the place.  Just because you said that right now, you probably would draw at least 40 people there.  I'm telling you, it's not that.  They're like, holy shit, he knows about us.  He gives a fuck.  I bet he's funny, and they'll go down and see you. 
[00:16:00]  They don't understand how small their country's out.  They probably know half the people in their country.  They're dying for a new place to fucking handle.  Ah, shit.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, Anthony, there was a story over here you would have loved to go off on when I was in London.  I was actually talking about it on stage.  They gave one of their own troops.  Basically, he was out on patrol, and they shot a Taliban guy, and the guy was wounded, and he went up to him, and he just shot him in the chest. 
[00:16:30]  He said something about, yeah, you do the same thing to us, you cunt.  Holy shit.  The guy behind him, for some reason, had a video camera.  Oh, my God.  He videotaped it.  So now the guy went up on murder charges, and he got life imprisonment.  He has to do at least 10 years.  Oh, my God.  That is fucked.  Allegedly, on the other side, if they catch any Americans or British, they were, like, skinning them alive and cutting their heads off. 
[00:17:00]  Yeah, yeah, but of course, you know, we can't.  It's one of those awful fucking technology things where it's because it was on film.  Right.  They have to prosecute the guy.  Right.  Because he's representing.  Yeah, but there's not, I would say, probably three days in the history of war that that has not happened.  Exactly.  You know what I mean?  And it is. 
[00:17:30]  Who's the idiot that was fucking videoing?  Why did he turn it in?  Why would he do that?  Jesus Christ.  They don't even fucking know.  Could you imagine that?  You know, put that goddamn camera down, Red.  Barnes wouldn't allow fucking anyone videotape him shooting some VC.  Wow.  It's also like, you're putting these guys in these ridiculous, it's not normal.  Yeah, yeah.  Like in World War II, they would say basically that the human brain can only handle, like, 200 days in combat. 
[00:18:00]  But it was okay, because you, the average survival rate was 114 days.  Oh, wow.  Shit.  Right, right.  You're putting these guys in these ridiculous situations.  Yeah, I don't.  Personally, if I could somehow stop crying in a foxhole and I actually engaged, like, I would.  Eventually, there's no, I'm already a psycho just trying to get through a fucking airport.  There's no way.  If you got me on the battlefield, once I killed one guy, I'm like, all right, I mean, if this heaven and hell shit is true. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I'm already fucked, so let me go to town.  I don't understand.  Let me stay alive as long as I can so I don't have to deal with Judgment Day.  How are they supposed to, why do they put soldiers in combat to the same level of, like, civilization as they do people that are, you know, just going to work every day?  Is that the Geneva Convention?  Is that why?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you know, fuck that shit. 
[00:19:00]  I mean, if you're out there.  You can drop bombs from the air that land on civilian sizes all the time, but that's not my bad.  I was aiming for the bad guys.  Yeah.  Right.  Wow, that is fucked.  Interesting.  I like your three.  Yeah, firebombed cities.  I don't know.  I think it's because there's no, like, the video.  It just was this jamming video, man.  It was, it's brutal, man.  I like he goes to that goodfellas jail, you know? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, where he could get some pasta.  Tomorrow we'll have sandwiches.  I got a 3.30 a.m. text from you this morning.  Well, I had to make sure you guys had the information as I was flying out.  That's all right.  I knew I was going to wake somebody up.  I'd fall asleep really quick.  It was not that big a deal.  Yeah, I figured I got called an asshole a couple of times.  Be thankful.  There's a couple people.  Oh, actually, I texted Dane. 
[00:20:00]  He was still up, but he's on the West Coast, so he got back to me.  So, I don't know.  Yeah, no problem.  No problem.  All right.  All right there, Bill.  I think that's all I got for you, fellas.  Have a safe trip.  We'll see what you get back, buddy.  Yes.  Absolutely.  Taking over Europe like Hitler.  I'm going to text you the name of the promoter over here.  The guy's great, and he really wants to get you over there, so I'll text it to you and send  it to you guys, and you ought to do it, man.  Just tie it in around a UFC event, so no matter what, you're going to have a good time. 
[00:20:30]  Thanks, man.  I appreciate it, Bill.  All right, guys.  I'll see you.  All right, Bill.  Bill Burr, everyone.  Bill Burr.  In Dublin.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  Talk about cuddle houses.  What is that?  I don't know.  I've heard them.  I've heard about them.  I heard it on the news this morning, and they said that they shut them down. 
[00:21:00]  Why are they shutting them down?  Well, because they think they're houses of ill repute.  But they swear there's no sex involved.  You just go there if you're lonely.  I'm lonely.  And you cuddle with someone else that's lonely.  Is that what it is?  They don't have people there?  They have people there.  Okay.  Yeah, it's like you pick your lady or your guy, like a brothel, who you want to cuddle with.  I've heard it could be just a whole bunch of strangers, though.  Oh, that's why.  But then you know it's just a bunch of dudes.  Dudes. 
[00:21:30]  Want to cuddle?  That's why that never works out.  No.  The women don't see it the same way.  No fucking way.  All the dudes are like, yeah, that sounds like a cool little thing.  Yeah.  But you're not going to get the women showing up.  You got the news story?  Yeah.  So I guess you've got to have some professionals in there.  Right.  To keep the cuddle business going.  That's the service they provide.  Uh-huh.  A lady to cuddle with in Madison, Wisconsin.  So it's an excuse to have some sex going on without getting caught.  No sex.  By the authorities. 
[00:22:00]  No sex.  They're just weirdos who like to cuddle.  So why are they shutting it down, then?  That's true.  Why?  Because they think.  They don't get it.  Oh, they think sex is happening.  But they're swearing at the cuddle house there's no sex going on.  Is there money in exchange?  Because even if there was sex, whose fucking business is that?  Yeah, there's money in exchange.  Okay.  It's a service.  Oh, man.  You see this fucking...  Wow.  That's some accidents happening.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Where was that?  Northeast.  People just flying into this big pileup.  Pileup.  Where's Germantown?  Oh, Germantown is in Philly, right? 
[00:22:30]  It's got to be in Pennsylvania.  Look at these fucking cars.  Yeah.  Wow.  Look at this sliding.  Oh, that's got to suck.  You see it too late and you jam on your brakes and you're just sideways.  How scary is it where you touch the brakes and you slow down by three miles an hour and  you know that you're hitting the car?  It's the worst.  That takes place...  That would happen in Wisconsin as well.  What?  As this story.  That's Germantown.  Wisconsin, it just said.  Oh.  Oh.  Well.  There's more than one Germantown. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, I guess so.  All right.  Let's hear the cuddle story out of Wisconsin.  Story you'll only see on News 3.  Oh, of course.  Of course.  Hi.  I'm Smuggle.  There's nothing new.  With wanting a little snuggle time.  Let's make the world a softer place.  Let's snuggle.  Oh, yes.  The old rug.  But that something old...  Jesus.  There it is.  ...is getting renewed.  Here.  Oh, it's going to be wild.  ...at the Snuggle House.  Even just a hug for a couple seconds can release the oxytocin in your body and your brain. 
[00:23:30]  Shut up.  Which has powerful effects to reduce stress.  They're lazy escorts, I think.  Yeah.  That is such a good idea.  Yeah, we would go right into cuddling, like spooning on a bed.  It sounds like kind of crazy, but because it sounds crazy, I think because it's two strangers.  It's two people that don't know each other.  And in our culture, that is so like...  That doesn't happen.  No.  And that's what I don't like.  I don't want to fuck after that. 
[00:24:00]  And whenever you like, we can change positions.  Just let me know.  Pause.  God.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  This guy is Jesus, by the way.  He's just like Jesus.  They show, I guess they're complete strangers, and they're in a bed, and she doesn't have  much on, and she basically said, when you want to change the cuddle position, just let  me know.  And he's got his rod on her ass that way?  Of course.  Of course he does.  Yeah, because they can't kick you out when you start poking them.  That is fucking weird. 
[00:24:30]  These two don't know each other, right?  No, she works at the cuddle house.  Right.  And he goes to the page.  With that dirty pillow.  You want to be on someone else's fucking dirty pillow?  Yeah.  Smelling bad breath.  Yeah.  What's this plaque breath or tartar breath on your cuddle partner?  Neat.  All right, let's continue.  There's a lot of therapeutic value in a, you know, wholesome, pure sense of physical  contact.  The snuggle house will soon be much like what you see here from the snugglery in New York. 
[00:25:00]  I make sure they understand that it's not sexual.  Sexual?  Oh, really?  No.  Leave it at the door.  Healing?  Oh.  Yes.  And this is...  Sorry.  Why is there no fat pig snugglers?  I would jerk off on their door.  You said leave it at the door.  Leave it at the door.  Gotta leave this somewhere.  He told me.  Right.  Wait, how come there's no fat fucking snugglers working for them?  Yeah, no sex.  But we make sure they're very attractive. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah.  Who wants a fatty?  Yeah.  Therapeutic place.  Sexual healing.  Doubtful.  I want to be in love with the whole world.  I want to be in love with every single person I meet.  The lines could become messy.  And if they become too messy, we would just end that client relationship.  Client snuggler relationship.  Client snuggler.  Anna Rohde will manage the place, and already she has a handful of professional snugglers,  including the lone man Lonnie.  It's like my goal in life to spread love. 
[00:26:00]  They know the idea is out there for some folks.  I'm totally ready for kind of people to be against it or not understand.  Where is it?  And I'm okay with that.  Wisconsin.  But if they can reach just one person.  Let's find a cuddle house.  I want to go to one.  Yeah.  Let's do this.  A softer place.  I heard they shut this fucker down.  I bet that's what Tim's going to suggest.  That we all have a group cuddle before the show.  Talk it over.  I think they're starting up a whole other house.  Imagine having to spoon with Tim.  We'll all get on the floor and spoon with Tim. 
[00:26:30]  Dice had a really funny joke about cuddling, how the girl wants to cuddle.  And when they cuddle, he goes, yeah, why don't you cuddle my prick with your two-inch cunt lips?  What a pig.  Oh, is that a piggish thing to say?  Oh, my God.  He said it so angrily.  We've got a big meeting today.  I think we should do a cuddle side.  A little cuddling.  Get everyone on the same page, right?  That's a great idea.  So they're starting a cuddle house. 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, because they keep getting kicked out of places.  There's got to be ridiculous frustrations, sexual frustrations if you go to a cuddle house.  Oh, my God.  How are you separating those two things?  We saw the lady.  She had her toes in between a guy's crotch as they were cuddling.  Yeah, yeah.  That's too close, man.  But they're trying to send out the Satan like it's going to be a good hug.  Let's look it up.  I could be in there in a few minutes and tell you if it's going to be sexual or not.  I'm really good at this.  I was like, I'm going to change the world one snuggle at a time. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, she thinks she's hilarious.  She's having a one.  I mean, we're like sort of happy like we just seriously want more love, more peace, more connection.  She's ass.  Fucking piece of pussy.  The Indy 500.  A lot of people have signed up for appointments and says veterans, the elderly, and those who have lost loved ones may really benefit from a snuggle.  That's great.  But we should also mention that the city is watching this business globally.  Business fields cookies.  There's no record of occupancy permits or a fire inspection to date.  That deadline to get it done might as well be Tuesday when the snuggle house is set to open, giving free hugs on the Capitol all day long. 
[00:28:00]  I think some folks at the Capitol could use a hug.  I'm sure.  But hey, I've been in Madison 16 years.  Madison's very open to a lot of different ideas, but I'm interested to see how people react to this on our Facebook page and other places.  Why do you have to send them to your fucking Facebook page to like the story?  Come on.  Is that it?  I'll say this, though.  It's only 60 bucks.  What, you found a cuddle house?  I'm just looking up the, I guess I just Googled it.  For $60, customers at the snuggle house can spend an hour. 
[00:28:30]  An hour for 60 bucks is not sexual.  Oh, boy.  That's a long fucking time for 60 beans.  Oh, of course.  I don't know.  But it says $60.  Rope to hang yourself is extra.  I snuggle out.  That's all they say about it?  Oh, cuddle party.  No, there's a whole story, but.  Human touch.  Now in our 11th year.  They do giant parties and everything.  It's not sexual.  It's just cuddle.  It's an orgy.  It looks like an orgy.  Yeah, but that's what. 
[00:29:00]  I think it's weirdos with maternal issues.  You know, they feel like they're sleeping in their mommy's bed again.  But while we were all starting our sex lives, you know, cuddling was pretty huge.  In the beginning, yeah.  You had a party or something.  Also like, all right, we're just going to cuddle, right?  Turned into dry humping.  Right.  Very quickly.  You attempt a little dry hump.  A little dry humping.  See what that gets you.  Now, ladies, calm down.  I know that's a sexy term.  Dry humping. 
[00:29:30]  Move the hips a little bit.  See if it's well-to-be.  See if she's receptive.  See if she moves them back.  You move your hand up a little bit.  Right.  Right.  Rub your little boner on the back.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  And see if she jerks away.  Right.  If she stays there.  Good.  Good.  Shirt.  Right?  Yeah.  Feeling all of a sudden, it's like, oh, I'm almost to the bottom of the boat.  You can feel the hot through her pants.  Oh, what feels better than that?  Like a fucking furnace.  Feeling the hot. 
[00:30:00]  Like a furnace.  She's still wearing jeans.  Oh, how big does that?  Dude, you ever rub the thigh, and as you get closer, you can feel the heat coming off the pussy?  That is fucking amazing.  Oh, the hot.  I immediately throw ice on it.  Oh, you got it.  Cool it down, please.  You're going to burn up.  Ew, ew.  Let's go to...  Put your hand up the shirt and get some bra for the first time.  Yeah.  But it all starts with a cuddle.  Are we kidding?  That's great.  Let's go to Larry in Tennessee.  Larry.  Larry.  Hey, guys.  Love your show.  Of course you do. 
[00:30:30]  I heard you guys talk about this, and I had seen a video a couple weeks ago on Worldstar.  A guy did a little mini documentary about this going on in Japan already.  Oh, yeah?  For quite a while.  The guy set up a dating service where they just go out to bars and have drinks and whatnot,  and they have cuddle houses all over the place over there.  That figures.  Japan is a little weird.  I'm still in the industry.  Man, I don't know.  It definitely seems really strange.  Yeah.  That's one big fucking tease. 
[00:31:00]  We're talking blue balls.  Right, right.  Well, I love the show, guys.  That's all I hate.  All right.  Yeah, if you were just cuddling all night when you were younger and you're cuddling, but you  didn't get anything?  That was pretty.  Oh, that was blue balls like crazy.  But it was also like you've said over the years, that's like hardcore sex.  Oh, yeah.  You were willing to forego the orgasm.  You're just very excited.  Touch something.  Oh, extremely.  You're not sleeping the entire night.  Nope.  Oh, my God.  No way.  Up against a girl. 
[00:31:30]  It sucked if you did fall asleep for like an hour and you woke up and was like, I wasted  an hour of time that I could have spent cuddling.  Dry humping.  Dry humping.  Chafing.  Oh, your fucking dick is just like chopped meat where the girl would be asleep.  Yeah.  And you're just sitting there and just, I bet she's going to wake up.  Wake up.  I bet she's going to wake up.  And you realize she's dead.  You didn't see half the fucker.  Did she have a finger in her asshole?  See if she's still kicking.  Making cumzies in your pants.  Yep. 
[00:32:00]  That's a lost art form.  Oh, yeah.  Keep giving her this awful boner poke, hoping to wake her up.  Oh, yeah.  Birdman from Long Island.  I remember you.  What's up, Bird?  What's up, buddy?  How are you, man?  It's $60 to get fucking blue balls.  Yeah, that's exactly what it is.  I think you're absolutely right.  It's too much of a tease for guys.  Hey, I was hanging out with this chick in Queens one time.  Chicken?  Pretty hot.  That's chicken.  That's why they call me Birdman.  Chicken Queen.  He's quick.  He's quick, this Birdman.  He's on the south. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, that's why they call me Birdman.  I'm a fucking chicken.  You're with this chick.  What happened?  I was banging his bro in Brooklyn, so I live on Long Island.  So I was fucking around with her, and all of a sudden she just stopped.  I drove on the BQE with the biggest set of blue balls, had a pullover, and jerked off  on the side of the road.  Yeah, you jerked off on the BQE?  I want to give Birdman the 11 to 3 slot on the channel.  Oh, who wouldn't?  I love Birdman.  Perfect fit.  You gotta fucking jerk off on the BQE. 
[00:33:00]  I don't even think there's a place to pull over on the BQE.  You don't have to.  There's always traffic.  Oh, okay.  There is one right by the bridge.  He knows.  Right by the bridge.  Right by the Gowanus.  Keep fucking that chicken.  Okay.  You keep fucking that chicken.  Jack off.  All right, Birdman.  You call back any time.  Jacking off on the BQE.  Let's give the Birdman the easy pass for the show.  Yeah.  He calls and put him right through.  So now we've got a video called Want to Cuddle a Stranger? 
[00:33:30]  Go to Japan.  Right.  This is the...  What?  It's called Assault on a Train.  Yeah, they love that.  Play it from the beginning.  We'll tap out when it gets boring.  What is this, a little documentary on the whole thing?  No, it's a quickie.  It's just a CNN story.  Oh, okay.  Go.  One of the largest and most densely populated anywhere in the world.  Also famous for its tireless workers or salarymen.  And here in Tokyo's Akihabara district, a place that's known for quirky ideas,  one former salaryman himself has come up with a very unique business. 
[00:34:00]  A co-sleeping specialty shop.  Yes, people come here to cuddle, Masashi Koda tells me.  Before you let your mind run wild, he says, yes, it is just cuddling, nothing more.  Customers pay about $40 to sleep next to a girl for 20 minutes.  Some customers are young men looking for simple companionship.  That fucking... 
[00:34:30]  Those two bombs fucked them up, something terrible.  21-year-old Yuhei Hiroki visits the shop almost every day.  He tells me, I like coming here.  It's unique and relaxing.  I try to stay awake because I enjoy talking with the girls.  Oh, God.  Do you have a girlfriend?  No, I don't, he says.  Good American haircut.  I've never had a lot of chances to meet girls.  Very spanky.  So this is refreshing for me.  19-year-old He-Nine.  Awful-ass pillows.  She works here part-time.  Yes, you do come.  She says most guys come here to relax and rest after working hard all day. 
[00:35:00]  They've clearly hit a nerve.  It's about 9 o'clock on Thursday night right now.  It's 9 o'clock on a Thursday.  It's not big.  It's about 400 square feet in total.  There are added services as well, but again, don't get any ideas.  Oh, okay.  1,000 yen, about $13.  Put your head on our legs.  If you want to rest your head on the girl's knees for three minutes.  Very expensive American hair, dude.  For a five-second hug. 
[00:35:30]  $13 for a five-second hug.  Masashi says he is surprised at all the attention his business is getting.  And yes, he is thinking of a possible expansion.  We might move to a bigger and cleaner space.  But maybe the simplicity is part of our charm.  A simple idea in a stressed out and sometimes lonely city.  It's like a Pokemon behind her.  He's falling in love with her.  Look at her milky white legs.  There's not a guy I know that wouldn't try to get more from a cuddling situation. 
[00:36:00]  You'd have to.  You'd have to.  You've got to be a fucking weirdo.  Even with the person that you're with.  I couldn't see cuddling for free for more than three and a half minutes.  And then you just snooze him.  I mean, you're either asleep or having sex.  $13 for a hug.  For five seconds.  She times it.  How romantic.  One, two, three, four, five.  Don.  One, two, three, four, five.  Stop a hug.  That's it.  Me pay for another hug. 
[00:36:30]  He's got his slick American head.  My spanky American head look like a rock and roll star.  They do look like a Billy Idol.  Yes.  Is that what he was going for?  Billy Idol?  I'm going for Billy Idol.  Wow.  There's some wacky things going on over there.  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  The Japanese, they got some strange shit.  They got those strange customs.  Have you heard about the clubs in Japan that have glass floors?  Oh, boy.  And the guys go into the club through the basement so they can look up at the skirts.  So they can look up.  Panties and holes and stuff.  And the girls are hired to be there.  They just sit on the floor, right?  What happens to the honorable samurai and everything?  Now they're down to looking up skirts.  Yeah.  But I would do that for more of a goof than a turn-on. 
[00:37:30]  It'd be fine.  I'd be like, this is hilarious.  You throw a couple of trannies in there just for this?  Oh, yeah.  Just to keep everyone honest?  Oh, I take a shit on the floor.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, oh.  Ha, ha.  That'd be great.  Girls just pissing and shitting on the floor.  Skating around in their own waist.  I would laugh.  That would be hilarious.  I would laugh, even if they were really hot, because it just seems so silly.  It's goofy.  And you know you're just hanging out with a whole bunch of perverts. 
[00:38:00]  It is goofy.  Yeah.  It's more goofy than hot.  Just cuddling, though.  And kettle.  This is the worst of Opie and Anthony's Sirius XM.  Feel like telling someone to fuck off.  Fuck you.

Dennis Falcone by the window as we were looking at snow.  And he said, he suggested, he goes out,  Hey, you guys going to do any school closings because of the storm? 
[00:43:00]  Well, let's get Dennis in here.  I think it's a good day to have Dennis in here, no?  It's not a good day. Why, is it Saturday or Sunday?  Well, we need to know how to handle a snow day on a radio show.  Yeah, and he relayed a story to me about him saying that, just don't go to work on a snow day once, and he got in trouble.  He got suspended.  Why?  Because he got on the air when it was snowing and said, hey, it's snowing, everybody, just don't go to work. 
[00:43:30]  He got in trouble for that.  He got in trouble because he told people not to go to work, and that wasn't accurate.  Yeah, damn Dennis.  He was a shock jock back in the day, I guess, giving inaccurate fucking snow closings.  Now that I know he busted both ankles, it's really awkward to see him walk.  Oh, I know.  Everything is obvious now.  His fucking pigeon feet.  Fawn legs.  Fawn legs.  Dennis.  Dennis Falcone.  We got a snow day here at Sirius XM. 
[00:44:00]  A memo went out saying, use your discretion, meaning I guess we could go home if we want.  Look at his Walt Disney fucking racist mustache.  Yes, that's exactly.  That's a great mustache for a juke-boing.  You anti-Semitic mustache-wearing motherfucker.  Dennis Falcone.  What do you mean not on air, guys?  Not on air personnel.  What?  Why?  Don't we?  No, because we're here to broadcast.  Yeah, but what?  We could drive?  We.  We.  What is that?  Although I did hear Denny last night on 60s on 6. 
[00:44:30]  I heard you played, uh, What's New Pussycat?  Tom Jones.  By Tom Jones.  And then you played some obscure fucking, uh, Neil Diamond song instead of one of the  hits.  What movie?  It might have been something we exhumed from the groovyard of your mind as we lay the dust  with this one.  Groovyard of your mind.  It might have been a lost hit.  What movie, uh, what movie is that song featured in?  That was in the, uh, what's New Pussycat?  That was the title song.  Tell song from the movie, the James Bond movie.  Jamie Bond.  No. 
[00:45:00]  No.  Woody Allen.  I think it was a cartoon movie.  Turbo.  No.  Turbo?  Yeah.  It's Turbo.  It's in Turbo.  It's fun.  That's some fun movie trivia.  And they got some cool, like, hip-hop song called Saturday Night I love.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  Look it up.  Turbo, YouTube, full soundtrack.  I like Saturday Night by the Bay City Rollers.  Do ya?  Good song.  Not a good song.  A-T-U-R-D-A-Y.  Nice.  D-A-Y.  Hey.  That's right.  Yeah, go to that second, second down.  Yeah, I know. 
[00:45:30]  Go there.  Now, you see all the songs listed?  You like this song, yeah?  Go to Saturday Night.  Now, you have to go to the fucking room.  No, just click on that.  Saturday Night.  Saturday Night.  All right.  Enough of the Saturday Night.  This is the best song for Turbo.  Turbo.  Turbo.  I love this song.  It's in Turbo.  It's by Azamatli. 
[00:46:00]  That's a catchy little drop.  A little orchestral drop sound.  Fuck Rebecca Black.  This is the Saturday song.  You need to be listening to it.  Why can't you do more?  Imagine waking up.  All right, then it gets stupid.  Sounds like Linkin Park.  Yeah.  Does it?  What?  You don't like them?  No.  You don't like that song?  No.  Why?  It sounds dated.  It's not.  It sounds very...  Maybe it's an old song.  I don't know.  It sounds very 2002 to me. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, wow.  Look out.  Excuse me, Sam Roberts.  Everybody ride the train from...  What was that movie?  Oh, boy.  Everybody ride the train.  Oh, boy.  I know that movie.  I wish you were on it 20 years ago yesterday.  I wish you were coming from Poughkeepsie last weekend.  Everyone got their little train bashing in.  Getting in everyone's way.  You can pile up on the highway.  Dennis, how do you handle a snow day on the radio?  Yes.  And I don't understand why the on-air people can't go home either, because we have to drive 
[00:47:00]  through this shit, too.  Yeah, what are we?  You're here to deliver it, though.  You guys are here.  That's part of our job.  That's part of being a broadcaster.  But if we know how to drive this, though, then the other...  Staying in a radio station all day, doing those long shifts, and getting the closings  on.  What are we, better at driving than the fucking people that work in the offices?  Right.  We're here already.  We're here already.  No, they're telling everyone else to go home.  That they could have left.  But we can't go home, so we're going to risk our lives?  We're a different breed.  We're here.  For dick jokes?  Yeah, we'll get some food catered in, and maybe get a hotel room, and all the trips  to get a caterer or killed. 
[00:47:30]  That's right.  Whoever brings in the food will get killed on their way home, because we want to just sit around  and give boring school closings, just staying on the air all day, you know, like from 6  to 6, doing the closings.  Okay, let's, you know, do it for alphabetical order.  Now, I remember in the day, as they called it, I would gather around the radio and listen  for my school, and they would, you know, give the school closings.  I had a great feeling when they said your school was closed.  It was great.  And the Elwood School District is... 
[00:48:00]  And I'd be like, oh!  Oh, the Elwood School District, that's us.  And then we'd go, yay!  And then we'd go out and play.  Yeah.  In the snow.  It was great.  Sadly, radio does...  Well, they put it all on the internet.  It's not sad.  Exactly.  They've lost their...  When it snows in your area, it's pretty safe to say all the...  If they start announcing schools closing, pretty safe to say yours is closed as well.  Most schools, and I'm sure your children's school, they'll probably send you an email  or a text.  Yeah, that's good enough.  Now you've got that, you've got a mass text, right?  That's a good thing, Ben.  It is a good thing. 
[00:48:30]  Well, it is.  It's technology.  But it takes away something that the broadcaster used to do.  One-on-one communication.  Oh, that fucking yes.  That communication that you're a friend.  It makes the radio guy even more obscure and useless.  Thank you.  Useless.  St. Ignatius Pre-K.  And canceling today.  All after-school activities canceled in the Longwood High School District.  I'm offering classes in my house.  Oh, is that it?  Your school's open.  Sure.  Pre-K only.  Oh, good business.  So young.  I'm doing extra traffic reports and extra weather reports. 
[00:49:00]  Can we go back to the school thing?  Sure.  Because you're reminding me of something.  Go ahead.  Got an email from my son's school.  Oh.  You know the whole PC thing we talk about?  Uh-huh.  So far, there has been no Halloween celebrated at school.  They weren't allowed to wear costumes.  They're three and a half.  Costumes.  That's their world.  Costumes on Halloween.  Oh, yeah.  Thanksgiving, they kind of ate together, but there was no acknowledgement that was a Thanksgiving  thing.  Right.  And then this came in.  Hi, all.  With the holidays approaching, we were asked to remind you of the gift policy from the 
[00:49:30]  school handbook.  Oh, sounds exciting.  The gift policy from the school handbook.  And I quote.  What is the gift policy?  I forgot, sir.  And I quote.  Yes.  This is right out of the handbook.  Gifts can foster competition among the children and are not suitable in our school.  Oh, fuck.  What?  I might have picked the wrong school, I'm starting to think.  Wow.  Because I...  Most of them are probably like this, dude.  No, I talked to somebody in the Harborfield School District, which... 
[00:50:00]  Competition.  That's where I came from.  They're like, all the holidays are alive and well in the classrooms.  Foster competition among the children are not suitable in our school.  If students wish to thank their teachers, a picture or other homemade projects are always  welcome.  As are thank you letters, notes from parents expressing their appreciation.  Please do not bring any individual gift to your child's teachers or staff at winter break,  year end, or any other time during the school year.  End of year, gifts are coordinated through class reps. 
[00:50:30]  That sounds fun.  The general rule of thumb and philosophy on gifts...  Rule of thumb is up to the fucking knuckle.  Is that...  I'm going to shove it up an ass, I guess.  Oh, good one.  Is that it's the sentiment that counts, not the product.  Well, then why care about the competition?  How about you teach that value to the children instead of fucking saying, don't bring in  gifts?  How about you fucking do your job and teach that to the children?  I don't...  Jesus.  I mean, I like taking care of the teachers because I understand they don't make anything. 
[00:51:00]  Keep it fair.  Keep it fair.  My son's going to a pretty good school and I know they aren't making that much money.  So, yeah, just...  I was just going to throw them $100 gift cards for Starbucks or something.  There's four teachers in the classroom.  Here, here, here, here.  Thank you so much.  You'll go to school jail for that.  No kidding.  It's very illegal.  The kids don't line up like in the movie Goodfellas.  They line up, give them a booster, give you a little...  You give the gift to the teachers.  We used to do that in school.  Oh, Denny.  We used to line up.  Denny.  And drop off a gift.  We don't know what you're talking about, Denny. 
[00:51:30]  Where's the competition, though?  Well, the kids, one kid will bring in a big gift and it's just...  Yeah, the poor kids can't afford to get nice gifts.  No poor kids are in the school, though.  Now the teacher's going to like him better because he got a good gift and...  Oh, okay.  They have scholarships.  Enough.  Send them to a nice private parochial school.  We have a little secret Santa, right, Denny?  Yeah.  If I knew the teachers were being well taken care of, then whatever.  But I know.  They're young teachers.  They're young, dumb, full of cum. 
[00:52:00]  Look, it's a dumb fucking policy.  It takes...  They're taking away all of these events that, like, as you remember, when you were a kid,  all those events were fun.  They made, like, you looked forward to things.  They were fun as a kid.  It was exciting.  And they're fucking taking all that shit away.  And I don't mind that my kid is going to be disappointed.  That's part of life. 
[00:52:30]  That is dad.  All right, you guys laughed a little too hard.  It's not funny, Denny.  It's a little funny.  It's a little funny.  Wow.  But there's...  He's got to learn disappointment.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can't protect your kids like that.  Does he wear a uniform to school?  Hell no.  Does he ever walk in...  Shut up.  Can he wear, like, a Santa Claus t-shirt?  Could he walk in wearing a Santa...  Shut up.  What if he wore a t-shirt that said Merry Christmas? 
[00:53:00]  That's a good question.  Or a walk in there wearing a little Santa cap.  Could he wear a Santa Claus t-shirt?  That's a costume.  I don't know.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  There's no hint that Christmas is here in this classroom.  No little decorations or anything.  That's fucked, man.  And I just thought it was still early, but I guess it's not early.  We're, what, two weeks out?  Yeah, it's not early at all.  Something you remember.  It's so weird to me.  Such fond memories.  No balance whatsoever in the thinking.  No.  It's unbelievable. 
[00:53:30]  That's not nice.  It's not right.  It doesn't break up the year into, like...  It's not right.  How do you break up the year, then, into, like, little things?  Because I remember it was, you know, you'd have Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and  those are the things you looked forward to as a kid.  And there was a lot that went around that.  Yes.  It broke up the school year.  You're right.  Valentine's Day.  We've talked about that before.  How disappointed you were when you didn't get the Valentine.  And, you know...  I never got the good one.  Of course.  You never got one?  You never got one?  I didn't get the one from the girl I liked.  Ever? 
[00:54:00]  No.  I got the generic ones.  What about the boy you liked?  I got the generic ones.  Generic.  Yeah.  The boy I liked, he was going to give me Valentine's, but he had two broken legs.  Danny and the broken legs.  Now that you told us, it's very obvious when you walk that your legs were set.  Yeah, I know.  You said that once.  You said, look, I'm wobbling down the hall.  Yeah, you walk like a fucking marionette is controlling you.  No, that's okay.  James Caan in misery.  Exactly.  I wish it was him in The Godfather. 
[00:54:30]  Did you also make the little apples for Thanksgiving?  The turkey apples?  We used to take apples.  We used to hollow it out a little bit.  Oh, you cut it.  You fuck it.  No, no.  You used to put the toothpicks and make the legs out of the turkey.  Little gumdrops and everything.  Oh, gumdrops.  They don't do anything.  Oh, what?  Gumdrops.  Why not?  Turkey apples.  Threw it out there.  Exactly.  I love it.  No one likes a turkey apple.  No, but we would do the little turkey hand drawing.  You put your hand there to make the turkey. 
[00:55:00]  That's hack, though.  That was hack.  Yeah, it was.  They're still doing that one.  Not in my son's school, but we did it at home.  Well, of course not.  What do they call the apples that are fucking cow shit or horse shit?  What?  Macintosh?  No.  Oh, road apples.  Road apples.  Oh, road apples.  Make a turkey out of that.  A road apple turkey.  Put your nose into it and twist it.  No gifts, though.  What the fuck is going on?  That's fucked up.  Exactly.  No gift for your teacher.  That's so fucked up. 
[00:55:30]  Exactly.  Oh, you wanted to bring my teacher gift?  Wait, oh, can't you just teach?  Sit down to the parents and go out.  This school might not be for you, then, if you can't handle the fact that a parent brought  in a nice gift for a teacher that obviously isn't making a lot of money.  It wasn't even going to be anything crazy.  It was just going to be a little thank you here.  Yeah.  Imagine if their note said gifts, but to only the white teachers.  Yes.  It is fucked up.  I mean.  It's horrible.  I don't like it. 
[00:56:00]  I've got to figure it out.  I remember bringing your Christmas presents into school after Christmas break.  Yep.  Take your favorite one and bring it in.  Fucking play with it in school.  Show off how great you did.  Shit got stolen.  Did it?  Didn't we?  Yeah.  I can never bring anything in.  My shit always got stolen.  Because you went to one of those schools.  Didn't we bring in gifts to the classrooms?  Yes.  Secret Santa.  Didn't we have, like, Secret Santas in class?  Grab bag.  Grab bag.  Grab bag.  That's what it was.  Okay.  We absolutely had that.  Exactly.  It was just called.  Okay. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  I played my own version of grab bag.  With your mouth.  The Secret Santa is when you put your name.  Everybody puts their name in a big box and you just pull out a name.  Everybody knows what a Secret Santa is.  We know what a Secret Santa is.  That's our good ball-stalking joke dollars.  Jim didn't know what it was.  I didn't say what a Secret Santa is.  We know what a Secret Santa is.  A grab bag was when you had the big fucking Santa bag.  Yeah.  And you'd put your gifts in there and kids would just reach in and get it with a girl 
[00:57:00]  one and a guy one.  There'd always be one weird one.  Yeah.  Like a fucking mouth tumor all wrapped up.  It was the worst.  Smell it.  It was terrible.  Because you get, like, shitty stuff and some kids would get good stuff.  It was shitty.  They shouldn't have done it.  No, that kind of taught you, you know, sucked.  But who cared?  Because, you know, it was Christmas at home.  I didn't believe half this shit was actually going on until I got my kid in school.  I'll probably wear a Santa hat to the Christmas party here on Thursday. 
[00:57:30]  It's not a Christmas party.  What's it called?  Holiday gathering?  Holiday gathering?  A little Santa cap or something.  That sounds kind of offensive.  Why can't they call it Christmas around here?  Because they don't want stupid to wear a Santa hat.  It's a gathering of the dilladoes.  But who would actually get offended if they called it the Christmas party here?  I don't think anybody.  I mean, I don't think Jewish people care about having a Christmas party.  They're just like, okay, free booze.  Yeah, we'll go to the Christmas party.  Sorry, ours became the number one thing.  Yeah.  Exactly. 
[00:58:00]  I'm not saying the religion, but I'm saying Christmas, Trump, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, and the rest of them.  All the XM people have to go to the Christmas party at the Sirius compound.  Sirius became the thing.  Exactly.  Ramadan.  Ramadan.  Ramadan.  It's not around this time.  Ramadan.  What does your Santa hat say on it?  No.  Yeah, just a Santa hat.  Does it have your name on it?  Denny?  No.  D-O-U-C.  Doesn't say kill me on it?  Have a nice Christmas.  Santa Claus tie. 
[00:58:30]  It's a Santa Claus tie.  I'll be strong of yourself.  I can't wait to see those Santas upside down with the tides.  Exactly.  Aren't you going to wear a red shirt to the party on Thursday?  Get festive.  Hope he gets caught in the elevator.  You'll be having a good time.  Ramadan happens in the summer.  How great is that?  June.  Oh, Denny.  I thought there was a holiday celebration this time of year.  Suspend it again.  No.  No, Kwanzaa.  God damn, are you offensive, Denny.  Oh, man.  It's like, I don't know.  They're all the same to me.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  She looks really...  Wow. 
[00:59:00]  Oh, my God.  They're partying.  Like, it's 1999 over there in Johannesburg.  I guess no one has to go to work over there.  It's not snowing.  It's a national holiday.  Yeah, it's a national holiday type deal.  Other news, we're following the...  Carol!  That's Carol, everyone.  Is that Carol?  Yes, that's Carol.  Chad.  Would you let me finish?  Let me finish.  Oh.  Chad.  Chad.  Chad.  Well, if you let me talk, Carol. 
[00:59:30]  Now, the pressure was at...  Humana, humana, humana.  Well, now we've got to hear it again.  Oh, God.  And my best part is when she goes, I was just joking.  He goes, yeah, I know.  I do.  I was only joking.  Oh, no, he said I was joking.  But the storm was 902 billibars.  Billibars.  902 was the lowest that you had with this storm a couple of hours ago.  So it has filled in a little bit, filled in with some air, not as low of pressure, but Camille.  Chad.  Let me talk, Carol.  Why don't you translate that for us? 
[01:00:00]  I don't know what that means.  What does that mean?  Well, if you would let me talk.  Oh.  Camille.  Camille was 908.  And so this is actually now not as strong as Camille, but not really as strong as it's been.  908.  I'm walking over here because I have this chart, but it's not in front of me.  His confidence has been shot.  God.  908 millibars.  That is flustered.  That fucking ball cutter, Carol.  26.81 inches of mercury.  I'm watching enough to know she's a twat.  He's just thinking, this is boring people.  This is boring people. 
[01:00:30]  Oh, it's 26.98.  Now, if you would go to your home barometer that you have, it's probably a big circle hanging  on your wall that you've got from an uncle's place.  No, it's not.  No one has that anymore.  If you go look at that, that is completely off the screen.  Rarely would you ever have to have a barometer that would go that low in the northern hemisphere  unless you were actually trying to get under a hurricane.  All right.  Thank you, Chad.  All right.  Just having fun with you this morning.  Just having fun.  That was a moment.  That is my favorite part.  You hate each other.  Nah, that's just having fun.  See, that wasn't fun.  See, Carol is a twat, and Chad jerks off to the weather, so it was like a perfect storm. 
[01:01:00]  Yes.  Literally.  And figuratively.  Exactly.  Yes.  You ever jerk off to the weather, Denny?  No.  No.  What do you jerk off to, Denny?  I'd rather not discuss that here on the radio, because I don't word blue.  I've discussed this with you before.  What's a sexual segment, not blue?  Well, we keep these things.  One time, we gave Denny a porno mag that we got in the office, and he said it was a little  something for him to look at while he was on the train, and he implied that he was going  to go into the bathroom on the train and masturbate. 
[01:01:30]  No, no, no.  Did you get boners on the train?  No, I'm not looking at a porn magazine on the train.  That was the implication of that statement, though.  I give it to one of the guys who worked here.  You didn't jerk off on the train?  No, of course not.  I heard you unwittingly used Denny as part of one of your ploys to screw over EROG.  When?  Oh, yesterday, when you made me open the box.  Don't say me.  I didn't.  Yes, you did.  You were cackling in there.  This is what a great gimmick.  No, no, no.  This was not me.  Hey, Denny, come on in here.  You've got a box.  We've got a box for you.  Apparently, EROG, remember with the Steiner Sports thing? 
[01:02:00]  Right.  Well, a package came for EROG.  From Steiner Sports?  Yes.  What?  And he wasn't here yesterday.  He had talked them into it, I guess.  Okay.  And so Roland and Sal called him and asked if they could open it.  Yeah.  And Eric said, no.  No.  And then Roland said, well, let me get somebody to open it.  And Eric said, no.  And then Roland got me in the office and tried to get me to open it.  Right.  But I said, no, Eric's going to know. 
[01:02:30]  Regardless of what we make up, Eric's going to know that I did it on purpose because I  fucked him all the time.  So then Roland, this is brilliant, called Denny in and said, hey, Denny, I got some beats  for you.  I got some headphones in this box.  And I knew he was joking.  I thought it'd be like snakes jumping out of the other can or something kooky like that.  Something fun like that, right?  From 1960.  Exactly.  Or some porn stuff or something phallic to jump out of the box.  And you said, no, but I'd like it in my can. 
[01:03:00]  I'm ripping open the box.  Sam is in tears.  I don't think any of us actually thought that Denny was going to open the box because Eric's  name was on it.  No, I didn't see it because he was holding the box down.  No, he was holding the box.  Roland was holding the box.  They made him open the box.  But Denny walks in and just starts.  It's a pair of magic shoes.  So you opened up Eric's box.  That's not true.  I didn't know it was Eric's box.  He just starts tearing it open.  What was it?  They said, oh, it's a baseball.  And they go, oh. 
[01:03:30]  And then they said, oh.  But it wasn't a Rivera ball.  It was just a Steiner sport.  I don't know.  I haven't looked through it yet.  But Denny, I could tell you the contents.  He went through it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Once it was opened.  Is it signed?  No.  I said, oh, it's a baseball.  And then they told me what it was.  That's it.  He broke the law.  Tampering with federal.  Wait, what?  No, no, no.  It's not federal property.  Oh, shit.  The mail?  Yes, it is.  Oh, boy.  It's true.  I mean, the mail is federal.  Why would he be taking 800 pictures?  Because he knew he was going to set me up. 
[01:04:00]  He was going to set me up.  And you opened a package that wasn't addressed to you.  You think Roland set you up?  Of course he did.  Shit.  Him and Sal and you ran on it, too.  It never ends.  You guys were all cahoots.  It never fucking ends.  Denny, all right.  You were great.  All right, Denny.  And you got in trouble, Denny, once for one of your snow announcements?  Oh, yeah.  It was many, many, many years ago.  And it was just briefly snowing.  And people were calling up.  And I said, you know what?  It's Monday.  It's snowing.  Let's go home.  Let's close everything.  And somebody at the courts heard that and thought it was official. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, what a dummy.  Yeah, and they didn't open an office.  And they said the guy on the radio.  Oh, no.  Oh, shit.  So they actually suspended you?  Yeah, I got suspended.  How long?  A week.  Or a shock shock.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  Without pay?  Yeah.  For a week?  For a week.  Oh, Jesus.  With 125 clams for the company.  Really?  Yeah.  I think it was 200 weeks back then.  You can't just do crazy stuff like that.  Well.  Announce somebody's dead or something.  Oh, that's just fucking, that's completely insane.  You got to draw the line in the sand somewhere.  You see what he did there, right? 
[01:05:00]  I saw what he did there.  Took a little shot at us.  No, it's not a shot.  A little shot.  Yeah, it was a little shot.  That's all right.  The old mayor.  We took our little shots.  You're in the Falcone crosshairs.  But you guys were young.  You guys were young.  You were like, what, 29 maybe back then?  Oh, more sarcasm.  Oh.  Oh, and Danny sets his sights on you.  I know.  Somebody is feeling comfortable.  I got to get back.  I got work to do on the Holiday Channel.  No, but yeah.  The Holiday Channel's set.  It's all done?  No, no, no.  We got guest DJs and stuff coming in.  Oh, who?  Oh, Sam is rude.  I got a big red nose. 
[01:05:30]  Kevin Cronin of REO Speedwagon.  Wow.  It's a Cronin Little Christmas this weekend.  He's going to be playing the hits.  What's he going to do?  He's going to be playing some of his favorite holiday songs, Christmas songs.  They've got an album called Not So Silent Night because those guys know how to rock.  I'm going to listen to Kevin Cronin.  Yeah.  Wait, can we?  What's the big song off that album?  Yeah.  What's that?  He's got a bunch of them.  Not So Silent Night.  I got to hear this.  Is a good song.  Can we hear a little bit of that?  Not So Silent Night.  His version of Sleigh Ride is good. 
[01:06:00]  Sleigh Ride?  Yeah.  Is this all new?  It came out about two, three years ago.  So we're just helping out.  But every year you come up and...  I got to get a hold of the Larry the Cable Guy Christmas album.  He was up here yesterday and he said he's got a good Christmas album.  I got to play that one too.  I bet it's get her done.  A lot of get her done stuff.  I like the new Duck Family Christmas album too.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Duck fucking...  Duck Dynasty?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  They got a good song with Luke Bryan on there.  No, they don't.  Harry Christmas.  They don't have a good song.  Harry Christmas.  Are you hearing some of the REO Speedwagon that then he says rocks?  Yeah. 
[01:06:30]  Is this it?  Rock.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a little good old rock and roll here.  Is that...  A little bluesy feel, if you will.  Not So Silent Night.  REO, go.  This isn't even silent.  It doesn't sound like REO.  That's the album.  REO.  You're playing Winter Wunderland.  This stinks.  A beautiful sound.  Oh, yeah.  We're happy tonight.  Walking in the winter wonderland.  It's a song that you like to sing along with.  Yes. 
[01:07:00]  Go away.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Rockin' Christmas.  Rockin' Christmas.  Rockin' Christmas.  Rockin' Christmas.  Rockin' Christmas.  Hi, guys.  I gotta go.  Rockin' Christmas.  Oh, Jimmy.  I got a 945 call.  Jimmy's very young.  You missed the big meeting.  Yeah, I know.  I hate to miss that for a shoot.  Yeah, huh?  But, you know, if you want to come see me, check my website.  Tickets are really moving.  Oh, God. 
[01:07:30]  Be safe, my friend.  Oh, yeah.  Thanks.  Holy fuck.  Yeah.  Jimmy's gonna be at the Improv Thursday night in L.A.  Oh, no, no, no.  I need to even announce that, boy.  Tickets are zipping along at all the venues.  Come to my town.  We're here.  Come to my town.  And Bill wants me to go to Europe.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  Oh, it was like thinking about it yesterday.  Yeah.  I'm not thinking about it today.  Oh, boy.  The entire team needs to be fired, myself included.  Oh, God. 
[01:08:00]  See you, guys.  Jesus.  Say hi.  Hi.  There goes Jim Norton, all bundled up.  I would ask you to continue with us, considering we're down a man, but I'm not feeling it.  Oh, wow.  Okay.  Well, he just said he has to, you know.  Is it a quality issue?  He has to go and do his Christmas stuff.  Yeah, you've got to program the Christmas job.  You've got to get that Kevin Cronin fucking Christmas thing. 
[01:08:30]  I can't stand Christmas music.  No?  I'll listen to, like, Christmas Eve while I'm driving home from somewhere.  That's about it.  Oh, I love it.  I've already started listening to it.  No.  Have you?  Oh, yeah.  I haven't.  I'll put it on Denny's channel, the Holly channel.  There is one Christmas song I do like.  Oh, no.  There is one Christmas song I do like.  No!  Yeah!  This is my favorite Christmas song of all time.  Very good, E-Rock.  But I mean...  But there's one I really like.  The one you really like. 
[01:09:00]  Yes.  Jingle Bells with Barry Manilow.  Expose.  Shhh!  Shit.  I hate this.  I was feeling pretty good.  La, la, la, la.  Taking my time on the la, la, la, la.  Snow falling down in the la, la, la, la.  I hate this.  Everybody singing like la, la, la, la.  Dacking all the halls with the la, la, la.  With the la, la.  Taking my way to the la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  I fucking hate this song. 
[01:09:30]  It's not Christmassy.  Let's ask Denny, he's the expert.  It's depressing and stupid.  I'd like to act a little queer.  Shut up.  Mortimer Leaf.  It's a dirge.  It's not festive and jolly.  Right, thank you.  Christmas songs have to be festive.  It's real.  No, it's shit.  Yeah, this is very visual, man.  I like this one.  You like this one, Denny?  Not really.  It's shit.  Not really. 
[01:10:00]  What?  I don't care for that.  But you know what?  If we test it and we research as well, we'll get a few things.  Remember the research?  Yeah, the call-out research.  I was a call-out research guy for WBAB.  Playing the hooks?  I played the hooks and I couldn't get anyone to do it, so I would just make it up every  night.  Play the hooks down the phone line.  Because if we didn't make it up, then we got in trouble.  If we didn't get enough responses.  So you just bullshit it?  Total bullshit.  So how would you choose what was good and what was bad?  That just wouldn't give life?  Sucks.  Yeah, pretty much.  Program from the heart. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  Every once in a while, I would do one that I know they want to be a good one.  Oh, like that the station wants to be a good one?  Yeah, yeah.  And then that way they'd be like, ah, the Oapster got the numbers we were looking for.  I completely fudged the numbers.  I was an intern at BAB and I couldn't...  That was my job.  I went there every afternoon and had to be on the phone for like four straight hours.  Nice.  And you would only get maybe one an hour tops that would do it.  You ruined the integrity of the station.  Whatever.  Who is this?  Is it Sleeves?  This is Sleeves.  What's wrong with you?  Sherwood Sleeves.  This is a holiday classic.  Sherwood Sleeves.  Turn this up. 
[01:11:00]  Not at my house.  No.  This shan't be played at my Christmas shindig.  I'm the guy that does the Christmas Day event now for the family and friends.  Why?  Well, it's my...  I kind of fell into it now, you know?  So everyone comes over to my house on Christmas Day.  Christmas Eve is still over.  Uncle Tony and him in France.  Yeah.  But, yeah, Christmas Day is my...  I shan't get that song even near my fucking house. 
[01:11:30]  Good for you.  It's only going to be festive.  Have a holly, jolly Christmas.  Very nice.  Yes.  You've got to go old school.  Enough with everyone trying to come up with a new Christmas song.  Tradition.  Uh-huh.  My mom always plays the John Denver Muppets Christmas album.  That's nice.  No, it's not nice.  No, it's not a lot of fun.  You've got to get some Burl Ives in there.  Burl Ives.  Jolly Christmas.  Little Andy Williams.  Although, you know what's good?  The new Kelly Clarkson show.  Shut up.  It's not good.  That's good.  No, it's not.  She stopped by this past weekend and was our special guest DJ. 
[01:12:00]  She wasn't here this last weekend.  She came in and taped it like two weeks ago.  And maybe she'll come back on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  Oh, I bet on Christmas Day she's going to be here.  Yeah, of course.  Leona Lewis.  Another great Christmas album.  New this season.  Oh, yeah.  It's a good one.  Yeah, a lot of good songs out there.  It's not good.  It's just there.  Jordan Sparks got a great song.  I just like the classics.  That new movie.  What's that?  The Bachelor's Wedding or something?  I don't know anything about that.  Travis, you got anything to add to Christmas music?  Yeah.  You like something?  No.  Oh, good.  Oh, no.  What happened? 
[01:12:30]  When I was a kid and I still had a mom.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I forgot about that.  She left.  Oh, man.  The Jew stole her.  That's too bad.  Some fucking thief stole her.  But at least you keep in touch with her, which is nice.  Holy shit.  No, I know.  That's terrible.  How long has it been?  Twelve years.  Her loss.  But at least you know she's not celebrating Christmas without you.  I do know that.  But when she did celebrate Christmas, she used to play a cassette tape while we were opening  our gifts.  The cradle song.  I'm on a loop. 
[01:13:00]  While she fucking beats it out the back door.  Everything was so obvious in hindsight.  I don't know why I didn't notice.  A cassette?  Well, yeah.  Because it was, you know, the early 90s.  Before she left.  Before she left.  Of cats meowing Christmas.  Oh, I remember that.  Yeah, yeah.  Meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  What is it with cats?  Meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  They do it with dogs, too.  The dog runs different.  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow.  Meow, meow, meow. 
[01:13:30]  Meow, meow, meow.  Every year.  Wow.  That sucks.  And people who have pets always say, listen, listen.  They always have to go try to listen.  Now she plays it for her new Jew family.  Now she's not allowed to listen to this.  Really?  Meow, meow, meow, meow.  Oh, look at his little face.  I love this.  This is the worst thing I've ever heard.  Look how cute.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  This would be on in your house.  Are you going to do something like this with Beavis?  I'll play this.  Little Beavis will go crazy.  You're down with this, yeah? 
[01:14:00]  Oh.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  They're hitting the notes.  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  How do they know?  Oh, he made the little...  Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.  Ha, ha, ha, this video is great.  I don't think I'd even want gifts.  Oh, that's so cute.  Did you just want this?  No, if I was like, if I don't take the gifts, do I not have to listen to this?  Oh, I see.  Ha, ha, ha, look, they're wearing little Santa hats.  That's so cute.  They're little kittens.  Yeah, but imagine listening to this without the visual.  And this is three minutes and 13 seconds long of this, too. 
[01:14:30]  Oh.  We had a double size.  It's like they're harmonizing.  Are you going to play this on the Christmas channel?  No.  No?  You don't do the novelty once.  We do.  But not this one.  Beats sleeves.  No.  What?  Beats the shit out of dumb sleeves.  How dare you?  No, hits with a beat get a rapid repeat on the channel.  Oh, fuck.  This hunk of cat shit.  I like the Yule Log.  Do you remember the Yule Log?  Yeah.  The cats are burying it in the box.  The Yule Log was not nice.  It was stupid. 
[01:15:00]  It had the fireplace and the nice mud of on fire.  I just want to remember, we had a real fireplace.  Well, some people didn't.  Oh, man.  We never did, but I do remember opening gifts with the Yule Log on channel.  Oh, you did?  WPIX.  Or was it WNEW?  Yes, no, it was WPIX.  PIX had it?  11 Live.  They still do?  They brought it back.  But it's only like for an hour or something.  And it's on the internet, too.  I bet it's digital now, right?  It's like fake fucking CGI.  It used to be a real fucking log on a loop.  Yeah, but you saw where the loop was.  I know.  Sometimes you'd go, ah, that's where it was. 
[01:15:30]  There was a jump cut.  Yep.  Whatever.  You'd feel lucky if you saw it.  I got to pee.  Thanks, Dennis.  Hey, any time.  Thank you, guys.  Dennis Falcone, ladies and gentlemen.

You're listening to the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hold on a minute.  Someone wants to say hi to you.  Hold on a minute.  This is perfect.  I think I found someone for you.  Maybe a connection?  Hello, who's this?  A connection?  Hi, it's me.  It's Diana, Lady Di. 
[01:20:00]  She's got to give every iteration of her name.  Oh, no.  Lady Di.  No, no.  No, it's not everyone.  Mike Buschetti, you want to go out with Lady Di?  How old is she?  How old do you, Di?  Every question has to be answered with a question.  It's always the question.  Keep track, people.  You'll have fun with this.  Yes.  Lady Di.  Yeah, how old are you?  I'm 51.  She's 51.  Okay.  Sounds good.  I'm a year old, but that's not bad.  Oh, yeah?  But you look a little better than she does. 
[01:20:30]  She looks about 60, to be quite honest with you.  Well, she's, you know, been through the mill a little bit.  No, come on.  No, I don't.  You wanted to ask me about Nelson Mandela the other day, right?  No.  Why the fuck would we want Lady Di's input on Nelson Mandela?  These people on Twitter.  The people on Twitter.  The people on Twitter.  So when the people on Twitter get her going on something, automatically it's us that, you know.  Why are you concerned about Nelson Mandela when you've got Mike Buschetti on the line with you? 
[01:21:00]  I know.  Nelson's gone.  You know, he's an old guy.  Well, he was.  The Mad Cuban in studio.  Fuck yeah.  We're just on the phone with Lady Di.  We just booked you for our show.  Yeah, we just booked you.  Sit down.  He was a very good man.  Who?  No, he was.  You can't take that away from that.  Well, you can.  He's dead.  She's still talking about Nelson Mandela.  Anthony, he was 95 years old.  Come on.  Well.  What did I say?  I don't know.  I have no idea what you're saying. 
[01:21:30]  I hope I get that wrong.  He was up there at eight.  All right.  Tell us a little bit about it.  Give us your reflections of Nelson Mandela, Lady Di.  He was the president of South Africa.  Right?  Okay.  It's not a quiz.  Just tell me how you feel about him.  Well, you know, how do you want me to feel?  I mean, the man was 95 years old.  Why was he happy?  Why was he so great?  Yes.  Why was he so great?  Oh, God.  There's the question. 
[01:22:00]  And Anthony, he was also a Yankee fan.  Yeah, I'm sure he followed all the games.  Sure.  That's why he died.  He was bummed about the Cano thing.  I don't know about that.  I don't know about that.  There's no sense of humor.  Why is she listening to this show?  No, once.  She has no clue what is funny.  Once in New York City, when he was giving a speech, he said he was a Yankee fan. 
[01:22:30]  Okay.  Because he was in the Yankee stadium and stuff.  Wouldn't you just do that?  Yes.  You just do that.  Right.  You just do that.  He wasn't a Yankee fan.  Why was he great?  Tell me.  Why was he great?  There's the question.  Yes.  He did a lot of things for South Africa.  Like what?  Give me some examples.  I've never heard of anything bad about him.  What?  What about the bombings?  What about when he was arrested for treasonous acts and bombings?  Yeah, what do you know about that? 
[01:23:00]  I don't remember anything about that.  Oh.  All right.  I don't remember.  Okay.  Well, that's good.  Why did you think he was in prison?  Right.  You know what?  I don't know.  Seriously, I don't know.  I was very young back then.  I have no idea why.  Yeah, but you don't have to be young back then to know history.  Yeah.  And you said you wanted to call up.  About Nelson Mandela.  Yeah.  So we thought you would do a little book report for yourself. 
[01:23:30]  And you were saying he's so great, but you don't know why he's great.  Right.  All right.  Wait.  No, really.  I don't know.  I think I might have just broke my hand.  I was pounding.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Fucking hurts a lot.  Great president of South Africa.  Why was he a great president of South Africa?  I don't.  You know what?  To tell you the truth, that's it.  I really don't know.  Then how could you say.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You were the one who said you wanted to talk about Nelson Mandela.  So how could you say he's great if you don't even know what he did?  I don't know what he did, really, to tell you the truth. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  How about one inspirational quote from Nelson Mandela?  When he died, everyone tweeted their favorite Nelson Mandela quote.  I didn't see the favorite.  Mine was, no one is born hating.  I kind of like that one.  Which one you got?  I like that one, too, because it's very true.  It's very true.  Right.  Well, I don't know about anything else.  Yeah, that's evident.  Mike, this girl is perfect for you, brother.  I got him confused with Norie. 
[01:24:30]  They're all pink on the inside, Mike.  Just remember that.  Oh, God.  Hold on, hold on.  What?  Another thing, too.  You wanted to find out about my Christmas plans?  What?  The Twitter people are driving her fucking crazy, and I love it.  And please, Twitter people, keep it up.  You know what, Linda?  Sure.  Yeah, what are you doing for Christmas?  We're just having a little get-together over here.  My roommate is going to cook, okay?  Uh-huh.  And everything is all set over here.  How would this be interesting for anyone? 
[01:25:00]  Why would anyone want to know this?  You just described probably ten, wait, how many Catholics?  There are over a billion Catholics?  Oh, yeah.  You probably just explained Christmas for a billion people.  Yes.  Well, yeah.  A little get-together here.  A little get-together.  And then the extra tidbit we got was that her roommate will be cooking.  Well, that's good.  Thank God.  That's good.  What is he going to be cooking, Lady Di?  He's talking about cooking a ham. 
[01:25:30]  Talking a ham.  Oh, wow.  How about that?  I'm going to cut off the bottom of your bicep.  What?  That's called the tricep, I guess.  Mike Buschetti.  Oh, yeah.  You got any questions for Lady Di?  Maybe there's a connection here.  You never know.  Lady Di, do you like ham?  Who?  Yeah.  Oh, my damn, yeah.  Why?  No, I'm just curious, because you're going to put a pineapple and cloves on it?  A what?  Say that one more time.  Some people put pineapples on ham. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I guess he's going to do that, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I guess.  You know, because he's the one that's going to go get it, so I guess he's going to do that, yeah.  I thought you were going to shop with him, really.  That's right.  Um, no, no.  No, no, I usually don't really go shopping with him.  She's too busy getting drunk in the morning, Mike.  She doesn't really.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  It ain't that.  This is the nightmare they don't fucking show you on Match.com, by the way. 
[01:26:30]  These are the nightmares.  No, no, no.  I got it.  I got it.  I got enough.  I had enough.  You can beat the shit out of her.  Yeah.  We go to the grocery store.  Sometimes I'll steer them the wrong way.  She didn't even hear me say that, which is perfect.  It's pretty expensive, and he doesn't like that.  In the grocery store, what do you do?  Pull the cart?  Get it?  You put all groceries in.  It was really fun for him.  But I haven't been shopping with him in over a year.  Fascinating. 
[01:27:00]  No, he likes going by himself.  So?  I don't even love to call it up.  He didn't say shit.  Right.  So your holiday plans are...  I go by myself when I go shopping, too.  You what?  I go by myself when I go shopping.  Oh.  Wow.  You're a big girl.  A very big girl.  Yes.  I go by myself shopping.  I hate it, really.  Yeah.  Lady Di, how many Natty Lights are you into right now?  What do you mean?  How many Natty Lights have you had?  It's not a what-do-you-mean question.  Yeah.  You want to know the truth? 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  This is my second one.  Your second Natty Lights.  Quarter to 9 a.m.  Yes.  Well, you and Lady Di.  You two are a match made in heaven.  It's too bad Lady Di looks like shit, or this would be a really good thing for you, Mike  Bichetti.  You don't mind, Mike.  You don't want to be like that girl that went...  That fucking said that about you when you were growing up.  Right.  You don't want to see Lady Di and go, oh, fuck, that sucks.  You know, then you'd just be doing what that fucking bitch did.  Oh, no. 
[01:28:00]  No, no, you're right, because you'd just come back to hit me in the butt.  Yeah, so, you know, maybe you two...  Hold on, hold on.  What, what?  How do you spell his last name?  Mike Bichetti?  What is that?  What are you...  Why?  What are you doing?  Taking notes?  No, no, no.  What I'm going to do, I'm going to pull up a picture of him, because I don't even...  I never saw him.  Oh, okay.  This could be fun.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Nice.  Are you by your computer right now, Lady Di?  My phone is my computer.  Hey.  All right.  Are you ready to type? 
[01:28:30]  No, no, no, no, no.  What's...  How do you spell his last name?  B-O-C-C-H-E-T-T-I.  Mike B-O-C-C-H?  Yes.  Okay.  E...  B-O-C-T-I.  B-O-C-T-I.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  B-O-C-T-I.  D?  D?  B-O-C-T-I.  How does D work into Bichetti?  I...  I...  What do you got so far? 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  B-O-C-C-H.  E-T-T-I.  E-T-T-I.  Okay.  And when I have a chance, I'll pull up a picture of you.  I have a chance.  No, we want to do...  I have a chance, bro.  I'm putting it on the back door now.  Back door now.  Now?  What?  You can't use your phone and look things up at the same time?  I can, but I don't want to do that.  Why?  What?  What?  Are you religious?  I don't want to gasp when she sees my picture, maybe.  That's what I'm saying.  Put it on speaker.  Why don't you want to do that now? 
[01:29:30]  Put it on speaker and look it up.  Huh?  I don't want to do that.  Why?  At least I know what Colin Quinn looks like.  This has to do with anything.  Colin gave up on this a while ago.  Hell.  I don't blame him.  She didn't write down the name.  She doesn't know how his name spelled.  No, I know.  Yes, I did.  I wrote it down.  All right.  How do you spell it?  B-O-C-C-H-E-T-T-I.  All right.  Right again.  All right.  She's good.  That didn't take that.  I'm going to look it up later on.  Oh, God.  Oh, thanks.  I like being tossed in the furnace. 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, yeah.  She's going to judge you.  So what are you, judging him?  Oh, no.  Women are like, oh, yeah.  They're very like, anybody.  No, women are very planistic.  Yeah.  Planistic indeed.  Where are you thinking you two go out to some gin mill or something?  Oh, I haven't drank in years.  Yeah.  He doesn't drink, Di.  What do you think?  Yeah.  That's okay.  Why?  How is that okay?  Right.  You're a lush.  I don't know.  All right.  It just means more for her.  Well, that's true.  Right.  It doesn't mean more for me. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, sorry.  I really meant that when I said it.  But, Mike, you've got to deal with a girl that, like, wants to drink all the time.  That's kind of a pain.  Are you a good drunk?  She's not a good person.  Yeah.  Are you a good drunk, Lady Di?  No, no, no.  I usually eat.  What are you talking about?  What the fuck?  If I just drank, I would be drunk.  What the fuck?  No, I'm saying.  Yeah, no shit.  I said, are you a good drunk? 
[01:31:00]  Am I a good drunk?  Yeah.  What the fuck?  Question what a question.  No one was ever questioning the fact that you eat, Lady Di.  All right.  No, no, no.  I'm all right.  Yeah.  I worry when people say they're right when they're drunk.  I bet she gets belligerent.  Sure.  No, I don't.  No, I don't get belligerent.  Do you get, how do you get?  Do you get fun?  Happy.  Happy.  Happy.  Oh, good enough.  Punch and fight at Walmart. 
[01:31:30]  All right.  We should go.  All right.  We'll take a break, then.  Yeah, we've got to take a break, everyone.  Okay.  Okay.  Happy holidays.  Yes.  Happy holidays.  Thank you, Buschetti.  We're going to probably try to get you in here next week, because we're really going  to fool around next week.  Oh, yeah.  It's the last week of radio for the year, and we're going to just fucking goof off.  Last big fiesta of the year.  All right.  It'll be fun, man.  I love you guys.  Thank you so much.  Yeah.  Lady Di, you want to come in?  Do I want to come in next week?  Oh, my God, the question. 
[01:32:00]  Let's see what happens.  I don't know.  Let's play it by ear.  Let's just, you know, see what happens.  What do you have planned, Lady Di?  I wish I could just live my whole life playing it by ear like her.  Play it by ear.  Yeah, the monkeys might be on TV.  Right.  You never know.  Monkeys on TV only one hour on a show.  It was a joke.  Oh, God.  Stupid fuck.  Thank God she put the...  Thank God she got the schedule out.  Let me know when the monkeys are on.  She answers jokes. 
[01:32:30]  She answers jokes.  She answers puns.  She answers sarcasm.  She just...  But she'll tell everyone.  She's a huge fan of the show.  Oh, yeah.  She's a huge fan of the show.  I know.  We don't know why, though.  Lady Di.  Why are you...  I always love you guys.  Come on.  Why are you a huge fan of the show?  I loved you guys from the very beginning.  Come on.  Why?  Why?  The question is why.  Because you guys are funny.  Oh, I am.  It doesn't seem like you really know what funny is. 
[01:33:00]  When you were on...  I have nothing against XM.  I just don't have it.  All right?  Yeah.  But when you were on WDW, and I used to drive home in the morning, in the morning, in the  afternoon, okay, I used to listen to you guys all the time.  Oh, well, you're weaving all over the road, being hammered.  Right.  I'm weaving all over the road.  Oh, okay.  Answer the question.  Answer the joke.  Answer everything.  Holy shit.  Stop answering everything. 
[01:33:30]  Stop answering everything.  Right.  Lady Di, you used to drive home from the beer place a little tipsy, right?  No.  A little.  A little.  A little bit, right?  But you used to have a couple of beers during the work day.  No.  All right, Lady Di, to be fair, when was the last time that you did drive a little and  a little tipsy?  The last time I drove the truck?  Yeah.  Yeah, with a little, a couple beers in you.  Just a couple of beers.  I didn't have any beer on me, but I drove it yesterday. 
[01:34:00]  A little drunk?  No.  But what time did you drive the truck yesterday?  I don't know, around 10 in the morning?  Well, you drink every morning before nine.  So you had a couple of beers.  No, I did not.  You had a couple of beers yesterday morning.  I don't drink and drive.  I don't do things like that.  But you had a couple of beers yesterday morning.  No.  Or did you?  No. 
[01:34:30]  I tried to call the show up yesterday.  What happened to your phone?  And then if we would have answered and asked you what you were drinking, you would have  said Natty Ice.  Yeah.  See?  Sure.  See?  But you said you didn't drink yesterday.  But, but, well, wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  I knew I was going to drive, so I was not drinking.  All right?  After I stopped calling, I just waited until around 10 o'clock and then I went out.  But you had some drinks before that.  I did not.  No, I didn't. 
[01:35:00]  You're lying.  That's not true.  All right.  How much time did it take if you had a tank?  Yeah.  How many beers before you're drunk, Lady Di?  Me?  Yeah.  No.  The other person we're talking to with the name Lady Di.  That drinks.  I don't know.  Maybe about 12.  12 beers and you're...  I know the truth.  Just a guess.  12 beers.  12 beers.  You know, 10 beers just takes the edge off.  Oh, my God.  12 beers to get drunk. 
[01:35:30]  Yeah, she says you want to know the truth.  You're a fucking rhinoceros.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  She needs two six-packs before she's drunk.  You can hit her with a tranquilizer and it doesn't fucking have an effect on her.  That lady died.  It makes a lot for me to get drunk.  Oh.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, that's called tolerance.  Yep.  It happens with alcoholics.  Yep.  Speaking of tolerance, we have none for you.  None.  None.  Okay.  All right.  We got to go.  We got Dan Soder.  Have a great week.  Yeah, Mike, we'll try to book you for next week if you're around, all right? 
[01:36:00]  Definitely around, guys.  Thank you.  All right.  And thank you for everything today.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on.  You guys are going to be around next week?  Didn't we ask her in?  Yeah, we did it a couple times.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to keep that in mind.  Okay.  For what?  I'm just saying.  I'm going to keep that in mind.  For what?  For what?  For what?  Next week.  What?  I thought you guys were going on vacation.  You don't even have satellite radio.  I know I don't have satellite radio.  What are you keeping it in mind for? 
[01:36:30]  What are you keeping it in mind for?  Great question.  Marion has the satellite radio.  I don't have it.  Why are you keeping it in mind?  This has to stop.  Because Marion will keep me updated about what's going on with you guys.  Holy shit.  Oh, my God.  It's a dumb radio show.  Go fucking breathe somewhere.  It's a dumb person.  What?  No, not only that, but I also keep in touch with you, you know, on the computer also.  Oh, that's good.  She doesn't answer.  She had no answer for why she was going to keep that in mind. 
[01:37:00]  Why are you keeping it in mind?  We invited you in.  I know you invited me in.  You're coming in.  You've got nothing going on.  So, if you knew we were inviting in, then why would you say, are you guys on next week?  Guys, guys, guys.  I usually like coming in with Marion.  Come on.  And you know she works.  Just shut up.  Okay.  I'll tell you the truth.  Marion is holding you back anyway, so just come in here without her. 
[01:37:30]  She's not holding me back.  She's not holding me back.  I like to come in with her.  You can come in here and discharge on your own.  Right.  Yeah.  Wait, wait, wait.  Hold on a second.  That was nothing.  That discharge was nothing.  Clear discharge.  A clear discharge.  For the people that don't know, yeah, she had a clear discharge last time she was in.  You came.  She came in her pants last time she was in the studio. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  Oh, God.  I came in and I had to go to the bathroom and, yeah.  There was a little bit of cum in the panties.  Yeah, Mike, you might have to deal with some clear discharge.  Oh, no.  We're going on break.  She squirted while Kenny was talking to her.  Yeah.  We don't know what it was.  Yeah.  What did Colin do?  Get off the phone?  Yeah.  He bailed on this a long time ago.  I don't blame him.  We probably should have, too.  All right.  Let he die.  Thank you.  Happy holidays.  And you, too. 
[01:38:30]  And maybe I'll call you next week.  Okay?  Maybe.  Maybe.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Happy holidays.  All right.  Mike Bocchetti.  What's your Twitter, Mike?  Oh, it's Mike Bocchetti at Twitter.  All right.  So it's Mike B-O-C-C-H-E-T-T-I.  Oh, yeah.  Thank you.  Bye, Mike Bocchetti.  All right.  Okay.  All right.  Okay, cool.  All right, guys.  Have a great day.  All right.  All right.  Take care.  Also, the key...  Oh, my God.  What were you going to say? 
[01:39:00]  What?  It wasn't for you.  It wasn't for fucking you.  We said bye already.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  I'll talk to you next week, okay?  Have a nice weekend.  Bye.  Oh, shit.  She is...  I got to be honest.  I don't even know if that's good radio.  Oh, I love it.  I have no idea.  I love it.  I could talk to her for four straight hours.  Yeah.  She is so annoying.  It's so fucking annoying to listen to her. 
[01:39:30]  Throw every question back at us.  Yeah.  It's not annoying if you understand all her tells, where she answers every question with  a question before she answers the question.  And then she answers jokes, puns, and anything humorous.  Yeah.  As if it's serious.  As if it was a serious question presented to her.  Right, right.  Also, she lies constantly.  Yes.  Oh, lady, die.  It's like you're from the moon or something.  I'm not from the moon.  I'm not from the moon.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Cool.  All right.  Because we were speculating whether you were from the moon. 
[01:40:00]  Our assumption was that you lived on the moon.  Write this down.  We got our next bit with her.  Next time, it's all questions like that.  Just like outrageous fucking things.  The more outrageous, the better.  Just to hear her go, no, I'm not from the moon.  That's like when Lady Di was a fucking phantom pilot in Vietnam.  I was never a phantom pilot in Vietnam.  Right, right, right.  No, no.  No, no.  I wasn't a phantom pilot in Vietnam.  That's the bit.  Let's roll with that next time.  You'll remember?

You're listening to the worst, worst, worst, worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony's Sirius XM.  All right, we've got to move on to other business.  Oh, yeah.  The big, uh, winter festival party was yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Is it the winter festival party, or?  I believe it was the winter holiday gathering. 
[01:45:30]  The winter holiday gathering.  I've got to tell you, if we had done a show.  You were going to go?  I was going to stay in the city.  You were really going to go?  Yeah, because it sounded like something that would have been good for the show today.  A lot of booze, a lot of cupcakes.  Ant, please don't.  No, no, please, Ant, don't say that, because then that's my fault, because you weren't there.  Oh, shit.  No, not Mars' fault.  Mars had been on his game, man.  It would have been at the party.  That's that fucking wire.  It's like Apollo 13.  It just happened.  We don't know. 
[01:46:00]  Something that was there.  I blame Tom Hanks.  Opie stirred the tanks, and, uh, you know, spark, and boom.  We blew out half the fucking command module.  There you go.  So, how was the, uh, what is it called?  Winter holiday?  I think it was a winter holiday gathering.  Winter holiday gathering.  It's the don't mention Christmas under any circumstance party.  Right.  Well, everybody was welcome.  That's one thing people have to remember.  Oh, yeah.  That's what makes us different.  But why is it, if, uh, another, like, religious holiday is mentioned, that we don't care? 
[01:46:30]  It's fine, like Ramadan.  I don't care.  Or Kwanzaa.  And if they wanted to throw a Ramadan or Kwanzaa party around here, I wouldn't care.  Who cares?  You wouldn't complain that you're being left out?  Fuck no.  I'm being left out.  No.  Why would anyone do that?  I know.  And why would you listen to those people?  Christmas is the big man on campus.  Christmas, that's why.  That's the one to go after.  It's the number one.  That's your big one.  You knock it down and then you can be the number one, I guess, right? 
[01:47:00]  So everyone's got a bitch.  If they're not part of Christmas, why do they get Christmas?  And we get, uh, right.  We'll call it a fucking holiday extravaganza.  It was the year-end holiday gathering.  The year-end holiday gathering.  I don't like the word gathering for anything.  It's a party.  It sounds like, uh, you're in druid hoods.  Right.  And, and you're, you're chanting or something.  When there's a gathering.  It's, it's a Christmas party.  It's an office Christmas party.  Yes, it's an office Christmas party.  Period.  Can we fucking be a little bit of Americana here? 
[01:47:30]  Especially if you do it around when Christmas is being celebrated.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Anything that's a year-end party, but it's before the 25th, is actually a Christmas party.  But if people really want to get away from this whole Christmas thing and not mentioning  Christmas, then wouldn't you just blow off the Christmas time?  Because you're like, we don't believe in that as a company, and we'll throw our winter  gathering in January?  Yeah.  When it's very obvious there's no religious holidays around it?  Yeah.  You're just dressing it up differently. 
[01:48:00]  It's still, it's still a office Christmas party, but you can't say that for whatever reason.  Winter literally just started.  What are we celebrating?  I don't think winter.  Not even started yet.  Yeah, what's wrong?  You don't know your shit.  It was snowing.  Yeah, we got eight more days before Christmas starts.  Winter.  I mean, winter starts.  Yeah, really?  The winter.  Yep.  So we had the winter gathering way too early.  Yeah, it's still fall.  So technically it should have been a late fall gathering.  What is it?  It sounds like some pagan fucking seasonal thing. 
[01:48:30]  The winter gathering.  But you could still, you're still celebrating Christmas.  Of course.  But you just got to call it something else, because if you call it Christmas, people are offended.  But the people that will be offended still go to the party going, oh, it's okay, because  they didn't call it Christmas.  No one really cares, except like HR going through their rules to protect themselves.  Right.  Let's call it something else.  There's red and green cupcakes with holly on them.  What could possibly be more Christmasy than that?  Not the girl. 
[01:49:00]  What are the highlights of the gathering?  What did we miss?  It was fun.  Wasn't it fun?  They had the bottles out.  Popping bottles.  Yeah, people were popping bottles.  They had garbage bins full of beer.  Was Who Kid here?  Who Kid was not there.  Oh, damn it.  All right, then it's not a real party, honestly.  Sway was there.  Sway was there, okay.  All right.  And he brings the party.  He's an older OG, though.  He is.  He's an OG.  He's an actual OG.  Right.  But, man, if they could have got Who Kid on board, then this place would have been packed. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  Because then people would have been like, okay, it's happening.  What kind of music?  Christmas music.  Oh, well, that's weird because it's not a Christmas party.  Why were they playing Christmas music?  Do you understand the insanity of this?  It's so stupid.  As long as you don't call it the Christmas party, it's okay.  But you're doing everything Christmassy right there.  They were playing Holly Christmas Hits, the radio channel.  Yeah.  Although there was hip-hop being played in the fishbowl, because that was the ping-pong  room.  Uh-oh.  And they had a little DJ. 
[01:50:00]  That sounds like it's, uh, it looks stinky.  Stinky!  It's always fun to see Stinky walk by in the hallways.  He was at the party for a little bit.  Stinky was there?  Yeah.  For a little bit, but he had J. Thomas duties at the same time.  Oh, boy.  Ew.  That's disgusting.  Yeah, he was eating them.  Making cookies out of it.  Yeah.  Making holiday cookies out of it.  That's all he does on that show.  I guarantee it would be nutty.  He was nutty-duty.  Nutty-duty.  Um, but yeah, we all watched the big ping-pong game.  Ah, that was the highlight. 
[01:50:30]  Yep.  I guess.  That everyone had a root against the boss.  Oh, boo!  Boss!  Ah!  However, I'll tell you this.  What?  Sway was not victorious.  Of course not.  Did he throw it?  Well, I talked to Sway after.  Uh-huh.  And he said, uh, because I didn't, I don't know how that game is played.  Like, how the fuck do you score ping-pong?  Eh, it's like tennis.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, how the fuck do you score tennis?  Well, you get the point.  You've never played ping-pong?  No, I have played it, but I don't know how to score it. 
[01:51:00]  If you're the one that serves.  You can only score when you're serving.  And they miss.  Yeah.  You get a point.  Right.  I don't get it.  If you're not serving, and they miss, then you get the serve.  Right.  And now you've got an opportunity to get points.  I never bothered to learn the rules, because I can't hit that little white ball anyway.  That's fucking, uh...  You are so not a man.  Well, because I can't play ping-pong?  Yeah.  No, that's not how we play.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  No, that's not how you play.  This is the way we play here.  This is the ghetto version that they set up on, like...  It's the way we play.  You know what you mean?  And by we, he means... 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  Urbanites.  No, I do not.  I play with white people all the time, and only white people.  Shit, yo.  Yeah, right.  Yeah, he gave up on his people.  Yeah.  Anyway...  This is like when they play chess in the park by different rules.  Uh-huh.  Different rules.  Anyway, will you tell me if this is wrong?  Okay, I serve first, and I have two serves.  Hmm.  All right?  I serve.  If I score, I get the score, and if you score, you get the score.  Oh, yeah?  If you score, you get the score.  Right?  I don't think...  And then...  Wow, you don't know studios, and you don't know ping pong.  That ain't how you play ping pong. 
[01:52:00]  And then after my two serves, then I change over...  After your two serves?  Then it changes over to your two serves, and then it changes back to my two serves.  After your two serves, you get your two serves, and then your two serves to your two serves.  So what?  That sounds like everyone has the opportunity to score, then.  Right.  Exactly.  Uh-oh.  Well...  I'm not sure.  Yeah.  I don't know.  If you play by...  It's like we're all not a man here.  But if you play by tennis rules, then that ain't it.  Right.  But isn't that totally...  Wait, he might be right.  I am right.  Which makes us look like assholes.  Someone's saying that's wrong, Mars. 
[01:52:30]  You don't keep alternating the...  You get two serves each?  Yeah.  But do you get two serves each, but then the point thing is still...  You can only score if you're serving?  No.  Holy fuck, I forgot how to play ping pong.  You serve...  Yeah, you serve till you miss.  Stop.  Forrest Gump.  You sure?  Yeah.  I gotta be.  I was...  I'm trying to think of when I was watching Forrest Gump, and he was doing really well  at the ping pong.  Yeah, let's go to the Forrest Gump tape.  Forrest Gump.  Oh, there's a lot of fucking rules.  There's gotta be something simpler than that.  Oh, come on.  Just do the serving part. 
[01:53:00]  Everyone's calling.  Was there a holiday tree at the party?  Kevin in South Carolina wants to know.  It was...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was a Christmas tree, yes.  It's Christmas decorations.  It was all about Christmas.  It was all red, gold, and green.  Right.  See?  Look here.  Now, what are they saying about...  Someone says there's a new rule change.  Ping pong has new rules?  I don't know.  What?  I don't know.  Go ahead.  See?  This guy knows the rules of ping pong.  Looks like it's not as common sense as everybody thought, is it? 
[01:53:30]  He knows them right up until the next call.  I know.  That's what I'm doing.  Dave on Long Island.  Dave.  Hey, how you doing?  Great.  Hey, everybody.  I serve five times.  Whoever gets the point, gets the point.  Yep.  Then you serve five times.  Hey, whoever gets the point, gets the point.  When you serve from the right side, you gotta serve into the left side.  Oh, I know all that.  Yeah, yeah.  You gotta serve into the left box.  I do five, you do five.  I do five, you do five.  That's the way it works.  It always does. 
[01:54:00]  Always.  But you can only score if you're serving, right?  No.  You go up to...  The fuck?  How do I not remember how to play ping pong?  Is this how they were playing yesterday?  You're talking about...  You guys are talking about volleyball.  That's volleyball rules.  Oh, my God.  Are you playing volleyball in the lobby?  No, no.  That would be fun.  The only difference between me and the caller...  I would explain why your shirt was off.  The only difference between me and the caller is that he's doing five serves.  You do two.  And I'm doing two.  That's all.  And your shirt's off.  Well, I don't play ghetto rules.  Now... 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  That does sound like ghetto rules.  All right.  Let me go to Dakota to make sure this is right.  Dakota and New York.  Was that guy Dave Wright?  Yeah.  You get five serves and...  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  Well, you know what I was thinking?  Thanks.  I was thinking of the rules I saw once.  Because I watched a game once in Hong Kong.  Oh, is that different?  Well, King Kong was playing a game of ping pong in Hong Kong with his ding-dongs. 
[01:55:00]  That's the game I was thinking of.  And it is.  You serve until you miss.  And then King Kong would serve.  You ever play with your ding-dong, Mars?  No.  Okay.  You use a paddle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what happened at the Winter Gathering?  Well, I talked to Sway after the...  There was booze.  There was ping pong.  Yeah.  Sway threw the game because he was scared that, you know...  They played best of three.  Right.  Our esteemed leader won the first game.  Sway won the second game. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, shit.  They kept it dramatic.  And I talked to Sway, and he said that our boss narrowly edged out that third game for a victory.  Oh, boy.  Did he feel good about himself after winning the ping pong match?  I don't know.  You know what Sway should have done?  March a B or C level celebrity passed him, so he would, like, all run out to try to offer  him a show.  Distract him.  Oh, shit. 
[01:56:00]  There were...  Roland.  Ah, Roland was there?  Roland came.  Oh, shit.  Right there.  That's a party.  The price of admission.  No, because Roland's changed.  What?  You cannot bring that dude to a party anymore.  Oh, because he just bashes everything that's there.  Everything.  He's a snob.  Ever since he started hanging out with the fucking Cronut chef.  The Cronut guy.  That Cronut guy's a bunch of trouble for this show.  Yeah, he was just like, everybody's having a good time.  Everybody's getting a solid buzz on.  Uh-huh.  And Roland is just yelling at the top of his lungs about the food being cold. 
[01:56:30]  About pedestrian food and pedestrian...  This pedestrian food is cold.  Yeah.  Who wants a cold burger?  Maybe he was a pedestrian for a couple hours during the day.  Less of an issue.  He was talking about how the tacos were ice cold.  Yeah, and then he said the tacos were cold.  Ice cold.  As cold as the beer, he said.  Yeah.  And the beer was cold.  Like, he's rude.  Well, he's a foodie.  But he's become way more snobby than he used to be.  Bottled beer or kegs?  Bottles.  In a big... 
[01:57:00]  What kind of beer?  Big garbage bins.  They had like Brooklyn lager and...  Fancy beers?  Not super fancy.  Any just Bud Lights?  Things like that?  Sam Adams.  Yeah, Sam Adams.  All right.  They went all out.  All right.  Oh, here he is.  Roland, you didn't like the winter gathering?  What happened, Roland?  It was fine.  Just the food.  It was like 7-Eleven food.  And I will...  I'll say here, next year, I'm going to throw one invite-only in my office with the top chefs  to show people this is food. 
[01:57:30]  Wow.  Bunch of morons.  Why wouldn't they, you know, call you and ask you about how to cater this to all that?  You would have got a bunch of chefs that would have done it for free.  Yeah.  They got falafel, ice cold.  Then they had a macaroni and cheese with the tongs.  Was it coagulated into a lump?  Beyond that, it all lifted together.  Oh, God.  Why wouldn't they...  Didn't they have the little fucking...  You would think.  There was under there...  The Sterno the Magnificent. 
[01:58:00]  No Sternos?  And then they had the burgers, and then they turned on so high, so where the mayonnaise  is, it's boiling, and then the hot is cold.  There was mayonnaise on them, and...  Yeah.  Ugh.  So people are waking up, shitting their brains out, going, what happened?  It's the burgers.  Nothing but a hot mayo.  They should have asked you.  Yeah, it was awful.  Then the tacos were awful.  Everyone knows that you know your food.  So they go, hey, everybody, how's everything?  I yelled, the food's cold!  Uh-oh.  But, like, everybody's, like, drinking.  If they don't like the food, they'll have a few bites, they'll throw it out. 
[01:58:30]  Everybody's having a good time.  It's not meant to be a sit-down dinner where the food's supposed to be good.  The food is just there to soak up some of the booze that you're putting down.  This will soak up shit.  It's awful.  Jesus.  It was a party in the lobby.  It's bad.  It's not like it was, like, you know...  Yeah, it was just a little bit lowby.  Or just cut back on the wine, uh, whatever, fine-and-throwing.  Wine selection?  How was that?  But that's what people want.  They had a ton of wine.  Did they?  Good wine.  Nice Shiraz.  What kind of wine?  Nice Cabernet Sauvignon. 
[01:59:00]  Dom DeLuise.  They had Dom DeLuise, wow.  Dom DeLuise.  They went all out.  No, I didn't see anybody complaining about it.  A little glass of the Dom DeLuise, yes.  I didn't see anybody complaining about the booze.  No.  I mean, I wouldn't know.  Roland's all in, though, with his food and beverages.  He's just become such an insufferable snob.  Yes, wow.  I mean, free food is good food, but if you're feeling bad food, shame on you.  Yeah.  And everything has to come back to the food, too.  It's like you get into a conversation, you're joking, you're laughing, and then Roland goes, 
[01:59:30]  yeah, but who wants a cold burger?  Oh, it's like, no, we weren't talking about the food.  Oh, Roland.  Before we even got out there to see all the food, Roland was already telling everybody  that he researched the caterer.  Ow.  Why are you so loud?  You rock, would you punch yourself up there?  You're a little extra loud.  Oh, sorry.  So I didn't really hear what you said.  His confidence was building over the last couple of days.  Oh, man, right.  That's being pushed right down.  Say it again, I really didn't hear you. 
[02:00:00]  Before we even got out there to try anything or see what was going on, Roland was already  telling everybody how he researched the caterer.  Oh, my God, really?  And he probably did.  Oh, yeah.  It was awful.  I was like, oh, God, this is going to be a shit fest.  But everybody was having a good time.  Yeah, that's all that counts, right?  Oh, Roland.  Except Roland.  All they had to do was ask you, and you would have had some nice chefs down here that would  have done it on the arm.  But his priorities are all fucked up.  Why?  There's no way that the office, the people who work here, there's no way they would have 
[02:00:30]  wanted more money put into food than alcohol.  All they wanted to do was to drink it.  But I'm saying, I don't think it would have cost anything.  But he just said a minute ago, they should have cut down on the wine budget and topped  the food budget.  Was there a lot of food left at the end of the party?  Yeah.  Even the homeless will walk by that shit.  That's usually a sign.  Even the homeless will walk by that shit, he says.  Wow.  Next year, I'm going to throw my own invite-only office party.  And I go, oh, look. 
[02:01:00]  Why wait until next year?  We have one more week left before we take a little break.  So why don't you set up your party next week?  I'm finding home.  When?  Tomorrow.  You're done?  Tomorrow?  Mm-hmm.  There's going to be like no staff here next week.  I'm here with you guys.  Why the fuck?  I think it's like me and Travis.  Troy's going to be here for a little while.  What happens?  Because they said we have to take vacation.  We could have 21 days.  We didn't take all our vacation, I was told.  That's why you ate it.  Oh, well. 
[02:01:30]  What happens?  We'll be here.  They proved it.  So I was like, buh-bye.  So you're done for this year.  What do we got, a full week next week, and then that's it?  And then that's it.  We can do it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll fuck around next week.  We'll pump it out, as they say.  Yeah.  Sure.  But you guys are invited to my soiree.  We'll be invited to the office in a year.  Thank you.  So why don't you have a true winter gathering, though?  Why don't you do it in January?  Yeah, do your own winter gathering.  Well, I texted Cronut Guy.  He and a couple other chefs are in.  That's the guy that fucked you up. 
[02:02:00]  Cronut Guy.  Yeah.  Cronut Guy put you on the top.  He jaded you.  He was already well on his way, but the Cronut Guy was the one that really...  And the Cronut Guy has a new cereal that he made.  It's delicious.  Yeah, and Roland's running around yesterday going, the Cronut Guy's new dessert is his cereal.  It's delicious.  I got cereal.  Gotta get my bowl.  Gotta get my cereal.  Right.  So he's got a...  What is it?  This fucking...  This gourmet shit cereal. 
[02:02:30]  Dos de leche.  What is it?  Dos de leche.  What is it?  Dos de leche.  Dos de leche.  It's like a caramel chocolate flavor.  Oh, oh.  It's called dulce de leche.  Oh, dulce.  Or dulce de leche.  Which, by the way, the fact that Mars had to redo that for Roland is even more insulting.  Uh-huh.  Because Roland's Mexican.  That's true.  Mexican.  Mexican.  Mexican.  Mets.  He says Mets.  Mets.  Metskin.  Metskin, right. 
[02:03:00]  Metskin.  Metskin.  Mets-i-can.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  And what does that cost?  $50 for a bowl of fucking cereal?  Jesus Christ, it's $15 for that little thing of cereal?  $15 for a little bowl of cereal.  Is it healthy?  No, it's got real marshmallows in it.  Oh, I thought that was bananas.  I'm like, okay, I'll try it.  That's bananas.  That is bananas.  $15 for cereal?  What's the ingredients in this thing?  It's...  The chocolate caramel-like thing.  There's going to be gold doubloons in there for that fucking price. 
[02:03:30]  You know how much sugar's in that shit, man?  Oh, I bet a lot.  It's caramelized milk chocolate with a dulce de leche flavor.  And a plentiful amount of smoked cinnamon-flavored mini-me merengue kisses.  Jesus.  Meringue?  Meringue kisses.  Meringue kisses.  Spiced hazelnuts.  Spiced hazelnuts.  And a sugar brittle...  Wow.  Yeah, it couldn't be last.  That's not breakfast.  No.  It's dessert.  That's like something you would eat at the movies. 
[02:04:00]  That looks like an apple cobbler.  Yeah.  Ooh, that would be nice if they had that there.  I do like apple cobbler.  Wow, Rome's very angry.  You're angry about the winter gathering.  Yeah, because I went home and it blew my ass out from the food.  It hurt.  Well, I don't know what happened to Rowling, because he used to get drunk.  Like, he used to drink constantly.  Uh-huh.  And not care about the food.  And now he's given up drinking and is just obsessed, addicted to food.  Well, I want to drink a lot if the food is delicious.  I'm like, oh, great.  I'll drink a lot.  I'll drink a couple drinks, celebrate the food. 
[02:04:30]  Food?  I'll have both.  Just a minute, ladies and gentlemen.  I think something is happening.  This is the worst of O.P. and Anthony's SiriusXM.

What else happened at the party?  Well, I mean, yeah, you talk about drinking.  Right.  Apparently, Dennis Falcone, he didn't overdo it with the drinks.  Oh, our own Denny Falcone was at the party.  But Dennis Falcone, he waited all day.  He's talking about the party. 
[02:09:00]  He wore...  Is he here yet?  He is.  Oh, I see that weird walk of his.  He wore...  He's walking down the hall.  They had Santa Claus do a town hall here for the Kids Channel.  Yeah.  Dennis Falcone got a laminate, because they give laminates to all the people who go to them in the audience.  Uh-huh.  He got a laminate, and he wore the laminate all day yesterday.  He wore the laminate.  Just to celebrate Christmas.  Like, that was a week ago when Santa was here.  He was feeling special.  He was feeling special.  Right.  Like, look, they gave me a laminate for the Santa Claus interview. 
[02:09:30]  For the Santa Claus interview.  Wow.  That's wonderful.  Is he almost here?  But he shows up to this thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he had, like, three beers.  Three beers?  Right.  Look out.  And all of a sudden, he's this whole other guy.  Uh-oh.  Really?  Like, I mean, he was inappropriate.  What?  Wow.  Dennis was inappropriate last night.  He was an inappropriate guy at the office party.  Wait, you have no problem going on record in saying this. 
[02:10:00]  I found him to be inappropriate.  Wow.  Why?  Whoa.  That's right.  I'm not issuing a complaint.  Here he comes.  But I thought his behavior was inappropriate, and I worried that some of the female employees  at this company, beautiful female employees at this company, may be offended by this.  Do you have any examples?  Yes, I do.  Let me hear.  You want to hear it before he gets in?  Yes, yes.  Uh, he announced, uh, he yelled out with everybody around him, who's got mistletoe on their belt  buckle?  Oh, no.  He actually said that. 
[02:10:30]  In just a sea of employees, bosses, HR officials.  He was that guy.  Oh, he got it wrong.  Uh-oh.  Eric's very excited.  He yells out, am I the only guy with mistletoe on my belt buckle?  That's even worse.  Oh, yes, yes, yes.  What happens at office Christmas parties?  You want to hear another one?  People lose their minds, yeah.  He put a lampshade on his head and danced around?  What is this, uh, from fucking Mad Men?  There's this, uh, this girl, uh, Lauren.  She's this young, 20-something blonde that works for the Cousin Brucie show? 
[02:11:00]  Uh-huh.  And this is her first Christmas party here at this company.  It's like a dream come true, right?  Oh, it must be.  She loves this job still, and, and...  That'll go away.  Give it time.  She loves this job still.  Don't worry, give it time.  And it's just having the time of her life.  Until Dennis Falcone asks her, hey, Lauren, how long till you hop up on that photocopier  and make a photocopy of your ass? 
[02:11:30]  Oh, you can't say that?  Yes.  For real?  Yes.  That's true.  Then, oh, no.  There's some other chick who's walking by.  I don't even know who this chick is.  I don't know her name, so I don't want to, and I don't want to...  Travis Teft?  It could have been Travis.  She wasn't here yesterday.  Oh, wow.  She had the same figure, though.  Oh, a little waif-like.  Mm-hmm.  And he goes, he goes, hey, honey, how about a kiss?  Hey, honey, how about...  Does he think it's 1950?  I don't know. 
[02:12:00]  Three beers in.  Oh, God.  It's not like he wasn't stumbling around.  He's living mad men.  He is living mad men.  He was.  Nothing wrong with that.  He was Don Draper with a pedophile mustache.  Oh, my goodness.  It doesn't help.  That mustache certainly doesn't help.  No.  The creep factor.  So, I mean, and he was like, immediately...  That's great.  ...like me and E-Rock, who was also at the party, and Liam, the talent booker, we were  all like, Dennis, what the fuck are you doing?  Chill.  Like, what are you doing?  That's crazy inappropriate.  And Dennis went on his, you know, spectrum argument. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, no, no.  Where, exactly, where instead of...  Oh, I forgot.  He's very inappropriate, but he doesn't understand that he's being inappropriate.  Right.  Instead of acknowledging and correcting his behavior...  He'll just deny...  He denied.  He justified.  We're at a party, and alcohol is being supplied.  We're off work hours.  Wow.  He really justified it.  It was crazy.  Yeah.  At one point, word was going around that the beer was starting to run out, right? 
[02:13:00]  Uh-oh.  And he was already, like Sam said, three beers in, and he disappears.  He comes back later, and he's double fisting.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  He's got to take one for the road.  Jesus.  Just in case everything ran out.  Yeah.  But, like, I mean, he wasn't the drunkest dude there.  It's not like the drinking was the part that was the problem so much as...  He's just got that in him.  Right.  Like, within the constraints of employment, he will adhere to all rules and regulations. 
[02:13:30]  But if he can justify that it's a party, it's off hours, they supplied the booze, then the real Danny comes out, who is the guy that says, hey, toots, you know...  Jump up on that photocopy.  Jump up on the photocopy machine.  Let me see that ass.  Well, people on the spectrum tend to not have a filter.  Yes.  Well, Poby, you may not know this, but it's a social disorder.  Or any self-accountability or anything.  Let's bring him in for a second.  Before I do this, one of my favorite parts, in our lobby, there's a staircase that goes from our floor to the 37th floor. 
[02:14:00]  He's at the top of the floor.  He claps his hands and yells out to the party, hey, let's go to the strip club.  And then starts walking down the stairs with a strip.  He was really making a scene.  He might as well have been walking around with mirrors on his shoes.  Right, right, shoe mirrors, trying to look up girls' skirts.  I'm starting to understand why he doesn't have a full-time gig on air.  Wow.  I'm finally getting it.  You get three beers in him, just enough to loosen him up to be his true self.  Well, here he comes to defend himself. 
[02:14:30]  Oh, yes.  Lovely and talented.  Denny.  Hey, Denny!  Who's going to the strip club?  It's a strip club.  What'd you say?  Remember at the end of Caddyshack when Dangerfield says, hey, everyone, we're all going to get laid.  Hey, everybody, we're going for lap dances.  It was just something funny.  That's what I was doing last night.  But you don't work blue.  Obviously, he's not blue.  He doesn't work blue on the air, but he works blue around the office in life. 
[02:15:00]  Right, at the office party, he certainly works blue.  And the office party was mainly populated by the people who do not get to have fun at this job.  Like the people who work downstairs that we never see.  They're not on-air people.  They're cubicle people.  They're, you know, bean counters and whatnot.  And the people.  I mean, the...  Behind the scenes, folks.  Behind the scenes.  And narcs.  And narcs.  They'll say something.  Yeah.  Because they've been told they can't put pictures of their children in their cubicle.  Right. 
[02:15:30]  Because it offends the women that can't have children.  But apparently this guy can get everybody lap dances.  Uh-huh.  Denny, I'm hearing you were out of control.  No.  We just had a few beers.  You had mistletoe on your belt buckle.  No, we had three beers.  It's funny.  People posting pictures saying, Denny, six beers.  Next picture.  Denny, five beers.  I had three beers.  Yeah, I said...  Two blue moons and a Sam Adams.  What about asking the girl to get on the copy machine?  Oh, Lauren.  I said, what are you doing?  She's standing by the copy machine eating cupcakes through.  Because she was, like, inhaling those things.  I said, hey, what do you...  Be careful to the copy machine.  What, are you going to jump up and take pictures? 
[02:16:00]  No, you don't want to do that.  That's not the fuck what you said.  You don't want to do that.  See, that's just it, Denny.  That's not what you said, dude.  You can't see.  No one blows my mind.  He said...  We have done, like, just vile, disgusting, shock jockery in our careers.  And we know you just can't do stuff.  But you know what?  I'm doing it...  I'm channeling, like, Dangerfield.  Just doing funny stuff.  Oh, yeah.  That's all I'm doing.  Oh, he uses character.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm doing it in character.  Dennis uses character.  Now, I'm the worst guy in the world.  He uses character. 
[02:16:30]  Or keep talking while we're trying to do a little bit.  But that's okay.  You gotta use characters.  Let me just get my point across.  Uh-huh.  That's why I grew that prior mustache.  Oh, yeah.  Just having fun.  I'm just doing lines from Rickles and Goofy's stuff.  Oh, sure.  Give me a Rickles line.  It's a party.  I love Don Rickles.  I'm a big fan.  A 21-year-old fucking girl will understand that you're doing Rickles.  Yeah, of course.  But she...  You know what?  Give me a Rickles.  I'm just saying, if it was something Rickles might sit, I don't know.  Well, you're lucky, yes.  No, no, no.  She wasn't laughing like, good one, Denny.  She was turning around to me and to E-Rock. 
[02:17:00]  Making faces like, oh.  And going, like, laughing.  Can you believe what's happening?  He asked me to make a photocopy of my butt.  Wow.  No, no.  I didn't say it in those words.  She said that you said butt.  Oh, no.  Wow.  Oh, shit.  No, no.  She said that.  She doesn't lie.  Wow.  She doesn't lie.  Okay, so we're just having a good time.  It sounds it.  We didn't have a good time.  It sounds it.  We're just having a good time.  That's all it was.  That's just a good time.  Good time indeed.  Yeah, that's all it is.  And there were witnesses. 
[02:17:30]  I mean, there were people from Hits 1 that were sitting there watching like, what the  fuck is Denny doing?  Who was there from Hits 1?  And the new guy you guys don't know.  Not the girls.  No?  None of the girls showed up.  None of the girls showed up.  No.  And Rich Davis was there.  Nicole ain't showing up if she can't drink with that kid in her gut.  Exactly.  She can't be around it.  I don't know.  They ran out of beer pretty fast.  Well, with the guys like you are double fisting like that.  You know I wasn't.  Geez, let some people near the beer, Denny.  I'm here this early in the morning.  I'm sure they calculated the...  Functional alcoholic. 
[02:18:00]  I'm sure they calculated the beer perfectly.  We're like, okay, if we have this much beer...  Oh, I'm sure.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They brought more in.  It's very likely that no one will be too buzzed.  Yeah.  But that to me is more disturbing.  Because like I said, Dennis, he's right.  He was not drunk.  Yeah.  He wasn't stumbling around.  He wasn't...  He was just a little buzzed and got some truth serum in him.  That's all it takes.  And all of a sudden he's asking girls who walk by him for a kiss.  No, I'm not.  You didn't say, hey, let's have a kiss.  No, of course not. 
[02:18:30]  Four different people told me that separately.  Oh, shit.  No, of course not.  I was standing by the tater tots.  And I said, you remember the movie Napoleon Dynamite when he stuffs the tater tots in his pocket?  Yes.  And the guy's in the classroom saying, let me have some of your tots.  Napoleon goes, no.  And he smashes them.  So we were just laughing about the tater tots.  I think they were warm.  I'm talking about a different instance of a kid.  But nothing about a kiss?  No, of course not.  You know what?  The tater tots goes back to Roland's point that the food might have not been up to par.  Look, people are just hanging out.  You can't have tater tots at a party. 
[02:19:00]  People love tater tots, though.  One young lady walked by and came over and gave me a kiss.  That's all.  Oh.  That's all.  On your belt buckle?  No.  On my cheek.  What did you say?  Not nice.  Nothing.  Did your helmet start getting hard?  I think she likes me.  Did you then solicit any other girls for a kiss?  Did you start filling up?  No.  Of course not.  Did you say, hey, the line.  I know where to draw the line.  I know where to draw the line.  Did you say, hey, the line starts here, ladies.  Did you have a penis vein popping out?  No.  No.  No. 
[02:19:30]  No.  His version of the story is not true.  No.  I know.  I don't know.  He asked a girl for a kiss.  Who did I ask for a kiss?  I don't know her name, and I'm not going to implicate her.  No.  Exactly.  We're on the air.  No.  You don't have facts.  Are you on the prowl?  No.  Are you single?  You guys don't have the facts here.  Single and ready to mingle?  No.  You guys don't have the facts.  You guys are just trying to get me in trouble.  You didn't say, am I the only one with mistletoe on my belt buckle?  I didn't have mistletoe on my belt buckle.  I worked with who would walk around at Christmas parties, office parties, holiday parties.  He didn't do this whole set up. 
[02:20:00]  Yes, I did.  That's bullshit.  I said it.  He said, hey, I've got a mistletoe belt buckle.  No.  And that was just a goofy thing.  No.  You yelled out.  Sam Roberts is definitely saying you're full of shit.  You yelled out, am I the only one?  He's there writing notes down at a party.  I don't need to write notes.  I've got to fucking steal, trap up.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Steal, trap.  Steal, trap.  No.  No.  No.  We were just having fun.  It was good, clean fun.  You said, am I the only one with mistletoe on his belt buckle?  How many times have you been hauled into HR for sexual harassment charges?  Never, because I don't mean it, because we're just having a couple of laughs. 
[02:20:30]  Dennis, that implies that you're waiting for somebody to at least kiss the tit.  No.  That's what that implies.  You know who else thought it was just fun and games?  The mayor of San Diego.  Just having some fun.  What's the matter?  Just a few headlocks.  A few headlocks, and I'll drag you around the office, squeeze a tit.  How much pre-cum was dripping in your underpants as you were harassing the ladies at the winter  gathering?  Any comments, any pre-cum?  How much pre-cum? 
[02:21:00]  None.  I don't know.  I was just having a couple of laughs.  Were you spotting?  No.  Were you spotting with pre-cum?  Oh, man.  He was sitting there offering drinks to girls all the time.  Nobody would accept.  Thank God.  No.  How bad did you want one of these young ladies to squeeze your balls?  Nice.  I'm doing jokes because you guys are just laughing and ripping on me all the time.  That's what these guys do all day.  Just laughing.  Roland walks around with a megaphone all day, yelling at me.  Yeah, but he's not sexually harassing people.  Oh, shit.  He knows where the line is.  He walked by my desk yesterday and broke wind.  He did. 
[02:21:30]  That's not sexual harassment.  Oh, God.  That's harassing me.  That could be some type of sexual harassment.  That's harassment.  The security lady, her office is right next to Denny's.  I think they put him there because of all the harassment complaints.  No, there's no harassment complaints.  She was so pissed at Roland because she walked into her office and smelled Roland gas.  Oh, my God.  Really?  She starts going, pew, pew.  And she's like this Jamaican or Caribbean lady.  She called him the most disgusting man.  That's disgusting.  She said, you got the nastiest ass in the building.  Oh, wow. 
[02:22:00]  He throws football and knocks hot tea all over me.  I don't keep complaining.  It's fun.  Nothing going on back there, man.  It's just fun.  What the fuck is going on?  No surprise that nothing gets done around here.  Roland desperately needs control in his life.  That's no secret.  Yeah, well, we got that.  But nothing that Roland does was worse than Denny asking girls who are in their 20s who  have worked here for less than a year to jump up on the photocopy machine.  No, it wasn't girls.  No, it wasn't girls.  It was a girl.  It's like the Nuremberg hearings here.  I didn't do anything wrong. 
[02:22:30]  Is she around today?  No.  I want to get her side of this.  She may be.  Maybe she can call in or something.  Yeah, let's have her call in, please.  I want to hear this.  No, it was just fun.  Good clean fun.  Good clean fun.  Did you enjoy the ping pong match?  Yeah, I'm not really a big ping pong fan.  Well, who is?  Really, when you think about it.  But knowing that guy, he probably set up cameras to make sure everyone was watching him play  ping pong.  So you're in trouble if you weren't watching the big match and make him believe you cared  about it.  I was upstairs by the cupcakes and then just having a... 
[02:23:00]  Yeah, you just did call the girls.  That's such a madman thing.  I know, right?  Come here, cupcake.  Call the office workers cupcakes.  Yeah.  Hey, cupcake, come here.  You do?  You like that show, Mad Men?  I've really never got into it.  How many fannies have you pinched around here in your tenure?  You ever smack a girl's fanny as she walked by?  No.  You don't put your hands on anyone.  You call her toots.  How many girls did you force to sit on your lap as you're programming the holiday channel? 
[02:23:30]  None.  Ask for suggestions from the girls.  Come here, sit on my lap and give me a 60s song.  You know what's very telling about Denny's sense of humor?  No.  We had, in diversity training, this is true, Denny, in diversity training, everybody has  to go.  Uh-huh.  And I heard at Denny's session...  He heard.  Yeah.  And then you tell me if this is not true.  Uh-huh.  That there was something about sexually harassing female co-workers, and Denny raised his hand.  No, it wasn't such a harassing.  Okay, tell me what the context was.  It was like, you can't have them do something. 
[02:24:00]  I don't know, but we were talking about...  It was the way you treat female co-workers.  Okay.  And Denny raised his hand.  All co-workers.  And said, hey, does this also apply to interns?  It was just a joke.  It was just a goofy lie.  We were just in the middle of diversity training.  But it doesn't work.  Denny loves the joke.  Why would you say this for the air?  Then you wouldn't be a shitty fucking part-time weekend jock.  You got good material.  You just got to start working blue, Denny.  No semblance of context.  None. 
[02:24:30]  That's fantastic.  You know what?  I wouldn't hurt a soul in the world, and they know that.  Because to me, I'm just a fun guy.  As long as they keep their ass on that photocopier, you know we're getting hurt, ladies.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Words hurt, Denny.  That's what you got to understand.  Oh, come on.  You guys hurt me all day long.  We do.  Sal calls me old man.  Pops.  Pops.  Well, the fuck.  Who calls anyone Pops?  I don't run to H.R.  He's calling me old man.  To be fair, you're quite a bit older than Sal.  Okay, fine.  But, you know.  You could be his grandfather.  You know that. 
[02:25:00]  Easily.  Easily, right?  Easily.  You know, we're just having a couple of laughs at the holiday gathering.  It was you laughing.  Everybody else was laughing in disbelief.  I was there.  Not at like, oh, Denny's a riot.  It was like, holy shit.  Where did this guy come from?  Well.  All right, Denny.  It sounds like everyone had a great time, though.  The guy that doesn't work blue on the radio is the most outrageous person around here.  He was by far the most outrageous person.  When the mics are off.  I bet they thought you were a shock jock.  I bet people were like, what station is he on?  What channel is he on?  He's a shock jock.  Do we have a shock jock channel around here? 
[02:25:30]  No.  This is shock jockery.  Eric, do you think Denny was the most outrageous person at the party?  Yeah.  By far, right?  By far.  By far.  Everybody was having a great time, too.  It wasn't like everybody was like, oh, I got to watch what I say.  Everybody was just having a good time.  Chilling out and enjoying each other's company.  We're just loosening up.  We're just loosening up.  Loosening up.  Get up on the copy machine.  Look, I also heard, and this is hearsay, so Denny may or may not have walked up to Sway. 
[02:26:00]  Uh-oh.  Dropping the M-bombs?  Well, he might as well.  Of course not.  He may or may not have walked up to Sway and said, hey, I love you on Hip Hop Nation.  Aren't you Ed Lover?  I did not say that.  That is false.  They all look alike, right?  They all look alike, right, Denny?  No.  That's the joke, isn't it?  No.  What did you do then?  No.  I didn't go up to Sway and say that to him.  I said, did you throw the game?  I said, that's true.  Eric, what's the story then?  Because Eric is the one who told me that.  He rocked comments.  He came up. 
[02:26:30]  He was upstairs again.  I said Fab Five Freddy.  He said this in front of myself.  Roland hits one people.  And he goes, sometimes I'll go up to black guys and say, hey, are you Ed Lover?  I love you on Backspin.  No, I did not say black guys.  That's a funny joke, though.  Get Roland in here.  That was a good one.  I would not do that.  But not at the party, Dennis.  Wow.  Everybody's just trying to have a good time.  No, they're just ripping on me because that's what they do.  Let's rip on Denny. 
[02:27:00]  Your natural ability is to work blue.  I don't know what you're ready for.  I know.  You should just embrace it.  It's supposed to be a judgment-free zone at the party.  That's why it's not a Christmas party.  Right.  That's what I'm talking about.  A couple of laughs.  Look at that juice.  That's some juice in there, yeah.  Some juice walking down the hall.  You like that, Denny?  I didn't see it, Denny.  I don't care.  Tell her to hop up on a photocopier.  I'll take some home with you.  There'll be a lot of toner in that photocopier.  He saw, but he's back to the workplace.  He worked hours, Denny. 
[02:27:30]  He put the mistletoe back in the drawer.  Let's make believe the winter gathering is still happening, and he'd have a lot to say about that.  Oh, yeah.  No, I didn't.  Roland, what do you got to add to the Denny thing?  I don't know.  He's had a great time.  He cracked me up.  Hey, honey, you want a kiss on the lips?  Not those lips.  No, I didn't.  I'm not saying it wouldn't be entertaining to listen to Dennis Falcone be outrageous.  Of course it would.  But I'm very surprised by this.  Hilarious.  He's told us many times he doesn't work blue on the radio.  And the context is so off.  I didn't say any foul language right now. 
[02:28:00]  We should have a Guinness Falcone tequila and donut day.  He participated in tequila and donut day.  Yes, he did.  He is a trooper.  He's done everything we've asked except for a curse on the radio.  I don't like to do that.  He's got that, but you're right, he doesn't curse, but he's got that old school mentality  of, yes, women are there to be harassed.  But that's not saying, not cursing is saying like, oh, I make sure I don't get a speeding  ticket, but you're a serial killer.  Right.  Like, it doesn't matter.  All right, we got Lauren on line one. 
[02:28:30]  This is one of the many girls you harassed yesterday.  It's not many girls.  Good morning, Lauren.  How are you?  Hey, good morning.  You okay, Lauren, this morning?  I know you were a little shaky last night after your interaction with Dennis.  But I got over it.  I'm okay.  I slept it off.  Now, without like, you know, doing like fake radio crap, what was, what did he say to  you exactly?  Okay, we were almost sitting upstairs by the cupcake area, and he was like four beers in  at this time.  Four beers.  And out of nowhere, he turns to me and he says, hey, Lauren, we're going to get up on  that copy or make a copy of that ass. 
[02:29:00]  I did not say, I didn't say, I did not say that.  It's even worse.  No, no.  It's even worse.  It's even worse.  Lauren, I did not say that word.  I said the, I just said, but maybe.  Okay, now the story's already changing, because he said before he didn't say but.  Right.  Right.  You're like in denial mode, because for the last two hours last night, you were going  around to everybody, and you were saying, I didn't do that.  And then the number of beers that you drank went down from five to three to two.  It went down from three, it was three beers. 
[02:29:30]  People saw you with three, and I saw a photo of you double fisting.  So those, somebody came up and said, here, take a picture.  Okay.  Let's all take a picture.  It was all goofy stuff.  Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you, right?  I love that.  Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you.  Lauren, you know that we're just having fun, right?  On the record, Lauren.  On the record.  You never want to have to say, Lauren, you know I wouldn't hurt you.  I wouldn't hurt you.  I mean, this is meant to be.  I'm not hurting you.  I'm not hurting you.  I'm a great guy, and it was all fun last night.  Oh, of course.  Lauren, I need you to walk down to the lobby with me.  Iraq, comment. 
[02:30:00]  Right after this incident happened was when Denny was drinking his beer, leaning on that  little part of the wall.  And Lauren, did he not say when this girl walked past, kiss, kiss, how about a kiss?  Well, this is what happened.  After he sent that comment to me, that's what started off everything.  Oh, yeah.  And then as girls, these are girls that we don't work with.  They're different from the 36th floor.  These are people that are like, you know, stuffier business suit type on the 37th floor.  And as these girls were passing, he was saying all these comments like, hey, baby, how about 
[02:30:30]  a kiss?  I didn't say that.  I didn't say that.  Oh, boy.  What happens?  Does he black out after a couple beers?  No, I didn't do anything.  Why is the story so different?  One beer is a blackout for Denny.  Yes.  I would have to believe my guys and Lauren over you.  Okay, fuck.  There's too many stories coming.  No, I said, how about a cupcake?  How about a cup?  We were giving out cupcakes to everybody.  Remember all the cupcakes there?  You don't blame the victim.  You don't call the victim.  Oh, my goodness.  She's not the victim.  She was a victim.  She got asked.  She's one of the cupcakes.  Why?  She was asking for it because of how she was dressed? 
[02:31:00]  No, no.  Are you one of those guys?  No, no, not at all.  She wanted to get dead ass on top of the coffee machine.  Not at all.  Just joking around.  Just having a few laughs.  Just having some fun.  Nobody got hurt.  That's all.  No one got hurt.  They're going to implement the Dennis Falcone rule.  Oh, Jesus.  The Dennis Falcone rule.  It's in the handbook.  A new edition.  It's in the handbook next year.  Addendum.  No, it was just fun.  It was just fun.  Yeah, of course.  By the way, Dennis is so weird because he was conscious enough, as this was happening, to look 
[02:31:30]  at me and know that I was going to come on the air with this tomorrow.  Of course.  And he didn't stop.  But I was just...  He was a madman on a mission just full of testosterone and cum.  We just had a good time.  Wow.  No, it was nothing like that.  Just all sex stuff.  People in Palatoga want to know, did you copy that ass?  Great question.  No, I did not.  My managers and bosses were there.  Yeah, that would have been a little awkward.  So were Dennis's.  Didn't stop him.  No, it was just something out of Mad Men like you guys were in.  Uh-huh.  Just a goofy thing.  You didn't watch that show. 
[02:32:00]  Goofy.  No, but it was just something...  I know it took place in the 60s, early 60s.  Lauren.  Yes.  Were you around when he started making claims about his belt buckle?  Oh, yes.  I wanted to mention that to Obey and you guys.  Thank you.  Actually, my manager brought this up later and he was laughing his head off about it.  But he said, hey, ladies, I have a mistletoe belt.  Who wants to be the first?  No, no, no.  I did not say that.  I said, I did not say that.  Because you guys hear these things.  I didn't say that.  I said, I worked with a guy who wore a mistletoe belt buckle. 
[02:32:30]  And I said what he said.  I wouldn't do that.  I said, wouldn't it be funny if I said...  No, I'm not that stupid.  You didn't hear that.  Come on.  You were trying to get the tip kiss.  No, no, not at all.  Not at all.  I'm believing Lauren on this one.  Here comes the pre.  Uh, yeah, guys.  No.  All right.  All right.  Who wants to go deep sea diving?  No.  Not at all.  Oh, Danny.  Danny.  Good for you.  Wow.  Not at all.  Danny's trying to get some.  Lauren's testimony is really hanging Danny out to dry here. 
[02:33:00]  Ever since...  No, no, no, no.  I love Dennis.  Dennis is a great guy.  He's funny.  He's a predator.  No, he's...  It was all early.  It was all good fun.  I mean, it got a little inappropriate.  Oh, my God.  Cousin Bruce is going to punch Danny in the face.  Oh, my God.  He's very protective of you.  Well, he...  The thing of Cousin Bruce, he actually made a comment last night out of nowhere.  He was like, I'm co-hosting a show with you guys in two weeks.  I'm like, Dennis, what are you talking about?  There was nothing said about you co-hosting a show with me and Cousin Bruce. 
[02:33:30]  Did you say that?  What's that?  Yeah, he said that.  No, Bruce wants me to help him out.  Just do some stuff.  No, but did you announce to Lauren that you'd be co-hosting with us?  Yeah, Bruce said, why don't you come in on one night?  He never said that, Dennis.  Oh, my God.  Yes, he did.  He asked me yesterday.  He said he'd like me to help out on one Saturday night or one Wednesday night.  So he goes, why don't you come in and call us with me one night?  I said, I'd love to.  Wow, I think you blacked out or something.  I do, too.  I think you blacked out because Cousin Bruce did not ask anything to co-host that show ever.  Well, okay.  We'll see. 
[02:34:00]  Oh.  We'll see.  We'll see.  It's a first time for everything.  No, no.  We'll see.  Ever since Dennis has grown this Tom Selleck mustache, he's just been all sexed up.  Tom Selleck.  You know what I mean?  No, no, no, no, no.  More like a Dennis Weaver.  Got Dennis Weaver in the studio.  You got the McCloud.  You got the McCloud.  Let's just call it the McCloud.  Hey, McCloud.  This picture tells the story, doesn't it?  Oh, shit.  What is he doing there?  He's holding the ice bucket full of beer. 
[02:34:30]  And he's got a dopey smile on his face.  Everybody's ignoring him.  Right.  But he's like just the wild.  He's obviously the wild man in the party house.  Somebody said, Dennis, do something funny.  So the ice was there.  I picked it up.  Yeah, there you go.  You were trying to get everyone going at this party, you know?  It was good, clean fun.  Oh, look at you there with the crew.  Yeah.  There you are.  Picture you up on the copy machine copying that ass.  Nice, Lauren.  Nice.  Look at the selfie with Scott there.  It was a good picture.  Oh, yeah.  It's Scott.  Scott, the professional ping pong player, apparently. 
[02:35:00]  Eric had to jump into that one.  Oh, E-Rock's in there?  Yeah.  E-Rock had to get a little FaceTime.  Uh-huh.  There he is.  I like that.  I like that.  Well, that looks like a fun little party.  All right.  We got to take a break.  Certainly, we're going to go back to this topic.  I don't think I think we should move on.  As more stories surface, there was no more stories.  Yes.  Lauren, thank you for your testimony.  No problem.  Have a good one, guys.  All right.  There goes Lauren.  Okay, look at this.  This dude from Hits One right here, his name's Tommy, and he tweeted. 
[02:35:30]  He just sent this tweet out.  Can you hear me?  Oh, boy.  What?  At Dennis Falcone is drinking and making sexually inappropriate comments on female staffers.  I was breaking my chops.  More witnesses.  More witnesses.  I don't even know who this Tommy guy is.  Exactly.  Who is he, by the way?  Because he also took a picture of our studio.  He works on Hits One.  He's a producer over at Hits One.  He's a fan of the show.  Seems like a cool guy.  Denny, are you claiming conspiracy now? 
[02:36:00]  That all these people are conspiring?  I'm an easy target.  You know that.  I'm an easy target.  I'm an easy target.  You know what makes you an easy target?  You go up to young female employees and you ask them to put their ass...  No, no, no.  Clench those ass cheeks.  I love that ass.  You guys take it.  Take a copy of that ass.  You know what makes you an easy target?  When you announce to the girls at the party that your belt is made of mistletoe.  No, again.  I said I worked with a guy who would show up at a party with a mistletoe belt buckle.  Who wants to suck this dick?  A long time ago.  And that guy was you, wasn't it? 
[02:36:30]  No, that was not me.  That was Mitch Kumstein.  I have a perfect record.  That old gag.  I worked for a guy that wants...  I have a perfect record and you know that.  Ladies, ladies, this Falcone cock ain't going to suck itself.  I do not say anything that rude and vulgar.  I'm talking to you in HR.  Come on now.  Did you point to your turgid cock and say, what are we going to do about this?  Did you go Jay Moore on everyone?  If I drank as much as everybody's...  I'd miss the stop and I'd be in Riverhead by now on the train.  Did you pull your bag out through your zipper and sing Jingle Balls? 
[02:37:00]  That'd be funny.  And then you'd jump around and make them jingle?  No.  Hey, Lauren, I know you're new around here, but what are we going to do about this?  No.  Lauren is a very good person to have on the team.  She's a good worker.  Are you sure none of this happened?  Not one bit.  Some funny stuff happened, yes.  Some funny stuff.  He went, let's go in the supply closet.  Some funny stuff.  Yeah.  Some funny stuff.  I would, you know, whatever.  I would go to other friends' houses, like a party.  You know, a bunch of couples.  You ain't going to do it in my house. 
[02:37:30]  And I'd get up to go to the restroom.  Yeah.  And I'd come out with just a towel wrapped around me and say, is it okay if I take a shower?  You guys got any soap?  What?  You kind of knew.  No, with a towel.  I said towel.  Just a towel.  See, you, see, you, what do you want?  Just for fun.  Your dick is on their towel?  No.  No, no, no, no.  I would just do something goofy.  I don't do that anymore.  I'm just leaving up a dicker.  Just fun.  Yeah.  Hey, is it okay if I take a shower?  I want to freshen up.  Just for the quick fun.  Just quick joke.  Opie, you have young children. 
[02:38:00]  Did you get a big laugh?  Yeah, I always did.  You have young children in the house.  How would you feel if you invited Dennis over?  Well, the problem is he's not going to be invited in my house.  Never.  Oh, my God.  That's too creepy for me.  What if Dennis and Anthony have broken out his character, the naked DJ at your party?  Oh, shit.  Yeah, why didn't you do naked DJ at his?  No, because he hired me to work.  Oh, he was working.  See?  I know what you draw the line as being a professional.  He's either on the clock or on the cock.  No.  Next time you have him DJing your party, you've got to have a point where you go, okay, you're 
[02:38:30]  off the clock.  You're done.  Hang out.  Hang out.  And then he's going to come walking out of your bathroom with your towel on.  Oh, yeah.  And he will be fucking someone doggy style within 15 minutes in your movie theater.  I'd take a hold of my clothes.  I'd have a box of shorts on or something.  I wouldn't do that.  Yeah, but we would just fine.  But your bare chest?  Yeah, why?  Oh, Jesus.  Imagine it's coming out.  Wait a second.  When people go in a pool, are they bare chest?  Well, they do.  Yeah, but when somebody, not in their living room.  No, and I would, I would, I have done that a long time, maybe when I was like 29.  Oh, there you go. 
[02:39:00]  You said you would do that now.  No, I wouldn't.  You just said that.  Those people don't invite me to their house anymore.  Why?  Oh, boy.  Yes.  Because you came out in a fucking towel.  Like it was a joke.  It was just a joke.  Just a joke.  Just having a good time with Denny, that's all.  Yeah.  That's all.  All right, Denny.  Very good.  I appreciate the time, though, guys.  Sam, I hope I gave you enough fodder for today.  Oh, boy.  Dennis, you're an endless fountain.  I love it.  Yeah.  You're a soldier.  I feel bad I missed that party.  That would have been fun to hang around and listen to Denny going off like that. 
[02:39:30]  Just trying to get it sucked.  However he had to get it done.  No, no, no.  Whoever, however.  All I want to do is make people laugh and give them a smile.  That's all.  And if you can come, then that's just about it.  No, no, no, no, no.  Not at all.  Not at all.  I just want people to have a good time and laugh.  Yeah, me too.  Where do you dry hump the women around here?  No, we don't do that.  Is there a closet you take them to?  No, dry hump.  The dry hump closet.  Let me show you how we program here at Serious Success.  You don't put your hands on anyone.  Never.  Uh-huh.  That's right.  But if it's through the clothes, that doesn't count. 
[02:40:00]  No, not at all.  But your elbow's a fair play, if you know what I mean, right?  Yeah.  A little elbow tits.  Right.  You know.  Squeezing.  No, no, no, no.  Passing each other in the hallway.  I feel like I need body armor whenever I come into this studio with you.  It's sort of the girls around here.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Picked it up, Denny.  I love it.  That's because you're a professional broadcaster.  Thank you for the compliment.  And I'm a broadcast professional.  And a party professional, too.  I don't need you flirting with me.  What do they call him?  The octopus?  Is that it?  Oh, he's all over. 
[02:40:30]  Well, again, how many hands does he have?  No, no.  No hands.  If there is one word to describe Denny, it's handsy.  But whatever I say to these lines, it's like with Groucho.  I always grab my glasses or something.  Hey, how are you?  Hey, how are you?  Yeah, but nobody ever called into a radio show to say, Groucho Marx made me feel sexually  uncomfortable at the workplace last night.  She did not say that.  And the secret word is intercourse.  Oh, shit.  Quack, quack.  Yeah, you kind of got it like a Groucho thing, almost. 
[02:41:00]  Exactly.  Dennis Weaver-ish.  Yeah.  Except not the sense of humor, unfortunately.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just the mustache.  Well, you know.  I have a pretty good sense of humor.  Oh, yeah, you do.  Yes, I do.  Yes, you do.  Well, we...  People like me, you know that?  People like me.  All right, we're going to take a break.  Thank you, guys.  Have a great weekend.  Thank you.  Oh, Kenny, anything?  Can I just say one thing?  Uh-huh.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  Shame on you.  Shame.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.

[02:46:00]  BG.  What is going on?  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Sirius XM.  Colin Quinn, what's up?  Oh, Carl.  Oh, my gosh.  How are you doing, Carl?  You called in the middle of a fucking train wreck.  We got Mike Buschetti, but he's on hold right now and you're on the line with Lady Di.  Lady Di, second Natty Ice Deep.  Right.  I heard that, yeah.  Yeah, we're very thrilled.  It's Friday.  I know it's not a good thing, but yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Well, Colin, I hope you were listening when Lady Di gave everyone her Christmas plans.  What is it, Lady Di?  Wait, let me guess.  What's that?  Would you like to come over?  Oh, wow.  I'd love to.  You got to.  Lady Di must love all these guys fawning over her on the phone.  Just one more thing.  Marion and I wanted to say Merry Christmas to the both of you. 
[02:47:00]  She told me that you might be off next week.  Who is this Marion, Brian, you talk about all the time?  Yeah, nobody's ever learned months ago.  I know.  Ever since the N-word incident.  She follows me now on Facebook, though.  Who?  Marion?  It's Marion.  Oh, good.  I follow you, too.  All right, we know.  I know.  It's all about you, isn't it?  Marion is kind of, it's kind of like she's become like Shirley, and you're like Penny Marshall  who goes on to direct.  Right. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Cindy Williams just dropped out, you know?  We are known as the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Yeah, we know.  That's why Colin did that Laverne and Shirley reference.  What a coinkydink.  Wow.  She would call you, but she's working.  She comes up with the most I-don't-give-a-shit statements.  Which makes it beyond fascinating.  Oh, yes.  Because she interrupts real conversations.  Yes, yes, with her just inane ramblings. 
[02:48:00]  What?  What's the Christmas plant?  Yeah.  The Christmas plant?  There's a question again.  My son's coming over.  Yeah.  I would assume he's coming over.  Are you going to put on a, you know, watch any specials or anything on TV?  Great question.  Specials on television?  Yeah.  Oh, question.  Question.  Yeah.  Question on top of question.  Okay.  Yeah, probably. 
[02:48:30]  What are some of your favorites?  Yeah.  Miracle on 34th Street?  Yeah.  I always want that one ever since I was a kid.  I like the modern one better with Dylan McDermott.  I don't like that one.  You like that one?  Yeah.  I don't like, no, no, no.  I like the older one.  Why don't you like the newer one?  I don't know.  You know.  Because it's horrendous.  Dylan McDermott.  It's like this classic, but common likes the one with Dylan McDermott.  Elizabeth Shue. 
[02:49:00]  Yeah, it's Elizabeth Shue.  Everybody.  What was that Tom Hanks animated one?  The Polar Express.  Yeah.  Do you like the Polar Express?  Or is that, you know, does that hit home a little too much?  Oh, wow.  Or hit, you know, hit something.  No, I don't want that one.  Oh.  All right.  What, what, I mean, do you watch Frosty?  Santa Claus is coming to town?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  I used to have those for my son years ago.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, wow.  You actually did something for him. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah.  No, no, no.  I mean.  Boy, you were able to afford a three-pack.  Does Marion come over?  No.  Good question.  Yeah.  She, I don't know, I don't really, I have to ask her if she has any other plans, which  she probably does.  I think she does.  Her calendar is probably full of the holidays.  That dance card.  She's a great in corner of Elizabeth, New Jersey.  She's got like 12 holiday parties.  No, it's really kind of early to tell, kind of early to tell. 
[02:50:00]  I'll talk to her later.  Yeah, it's real early to tell.  That's for sure.  She can't wait.  I don't know.  I'm going to talk to her.  I can't wait to look down and see that caller ID coming across the old fucking iPhone.  Oh, man.  It starts with do not answer.  Oh, we just got more info.  She just called a little while ago.  Oh, good.  That's good.  You really added a lot there.  That is good.  I think she has plans with her family, too.  And Lady Di, what about the big New Year's Eve party? 
[02:50:30]  What are you going to be doing?  That, I don't know about.  What?  You got a plan early or you're going to be shut out?  Miley Cyrus is going to be doing the ball drop.  Oh, is she?  Like a wrecking ball thing?  Well, I guess.  I'm sure she'll make some kind of reference to that.  I'm sure she will.  I'm sure she will.  Well, if she doesn't, Seacrest will.  You know that?  Of course she will.  Well, he's clever, that Seacrest.  He's the best.  Right.  He'll flinch from that kind of stuff. 
[02:51:00]  He'll be like, you know, don't touch there.  You don't climb this one or whatever.  Yeah, he's the best at all that, isn't he?  Oh, my God.  So, Lady Di, no New Year's Eve plans.  What did you do last year for New Year's Eve?  That's a good way to gauge what you can...  That's the way I slip right through it.  What?  Of course you slip right through it.  You slip...  No, it's called passed out.  Yeah, you passed out through it.  You passed out through it.  Oh, my God.  No, no, no.  I mean, you know...  I mean, New Year's is not a big deal to me.  Now, if somebody wants to take me out... 
[02:51:30]  Colin, I heard that loud and clear.  Loud and clear.  I know a few people here that want to take her out.  Are you suggesting Colin to ask you out for New Year's?  Yeah.  It would be nice.  Yeah, right?  Paul, you know, she's not quite playing hard to get over here.  She's a big guy.  I like it.  I like it.  Yes, yes.  I'm not going for that coy stuff.  I like it.  No, the straightforward approach. 
[02:52:00]  Right.  Diana.  Lady Diana.  You know, like Dirty Diana.  Yes, Dirty Diana.  Lady Diana.  Yeah.  Lady Di, would you, you know...  Would you do a little something with Colin Quinn if he takes you out New Year's?  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened?  It depends on Colin.  Whoa!  Whoa!  Wow.  Wow.  A little reciprocation for some big plans.  I'm sure Colin has something big going on on New Year's Eve. 
[02:52:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah?  I don't know.  He's going to have to instant direct message me or something or whatever.  That's the way she knows how to play this game.  It's like a dance, isn't it, Carl?  This whole man-woman thing.  It really is a delicate dance of love.  Yes, it is.  She knows how to play this game. 
[02:53:00]  I will even stay sober until 11.30.  Wow.  Well, you know, that's...  Wow.  That's a big deal.  You got a pregame.  That's how you know she doesn't have a problem.  Right.  Yeah.  You got to pregame a little, Lady Di.  Yeah.  That'll loosen up a little bit.  Just a little bit.  Maybe a couple of shots.  Yeah.  Some Jaeger.  I don't...  I don't...  Some Natty King Cole and...  Natty King Cole, yeah.  Natty King Cole? 
[02:53:30]  Oh, that's what she...  She just repeats herself again.  Well, Lady Di, it sounds terrific.  Have you...  You got all your shopping done, Lady Di?  Oh, Christmas shopping.  Actually, everybody...  Mom, you see, I can't give that away.  What?  Everybody's getting Christmas cards with a little bit of money in it.  A little scratch.  Crazy fuck.  A little money in it.  A little scratch.  Something going to need more than a list, probably.  How much money are you putting in the cards?  Yeah.  None of...  No, I'm not going to say that. 
[02:54:00]  How much about...  Give us...  Give us...  Give us ballpark.  A thousand dollars.  No, you're not.  A lying sack of shit.  No, no, no.  No, how much about...  Oh, let me see.  Yeah.  Should I say something or not?  No, I can't tell you.  Yeah, yeah, say something.  Just say...  Die.  Just say it.  What?  Just...  Let's get it over with.  You're going to say it eventually, so just save us time.  Right.  How much?  Everybody's getting 25 hours. 
[02:54:30]  25 bucks.  25 bucks.  25 smackaroos.  Nice.  That's pretty good.  From the lady die fortune.  From her dad's money.  You have no fortune.  Well, that's...  She'll always give it up.  Yeah.  She does.  She'll always give it up.  I think you...  I think you fell down the questioning.  No big deal.  Huh?  It's no big deal.  It's no big deal.  25 bucks.  How many people?  Certainly isn't.  How many people are on your list?  Well, actually, I only got four people on my list. 
[02:55:00]  That's a cool hundy.  A cool hundy.  Drop a banjo.  I can't just throw around money just like that.  I'm not...  You know, I don't have that much...  Hey, you're not made of money.  Right.  You also haven't had a job in a long time.  Yeah, and you haven't worked.  Hey, lady die, have you tried to get a job lately?  Yes, I have.  Where'd you go?  Yes, I have.  Breaking news.  I went all over the town of Elizabeth, and you know what?  Let me tell you something right now.  I might go beyond the town of Elizabeth.  Wow.  Wow.  She's threatening all the New Jersey town. 
[02:55:30]  Branching out.  Right.  How'd the Burger King get going?  How'd the Burger King gig go?  You know what?  I have no idea.  I would really love for them to call me.  They're close.  You applied at Burger King.  Yeah, I did.  Yeah.  How long ago was that?  I would say right now about maybe about a month ago.  And you just had fingers crossed for the old callback, huh?  Yeah.  That's that go-to-it attitude.  Lady Di, our organization could really use a go-getter like you. 
[02:56:00]  Well, you know what?  You know what?  We only have the one truck.  Okay?  And Bill does need the truck every once in a while.  We only have one vehicle.  Yeah.  All right?  So I don't want to go too far.  Isn't there public transportation?  Right.  That would explain why you haven't worked in six years.  Public transportation?  From where I lived to Burger King, that's only two blocks down.  You don't need no public transportation.  All right, well, you can walk the two blocks.  But you don't have that job. 
[02:56:30]  Right.  You've got to get a job.  You have to take the bus to run.  I know what I've got to get.  Lady Di, where else did you apply?  Well, I tried Family Dollar.  That fucking Family Dollar again?  Enough with Family Dollar.  They don't want you.  I'm having a problem applying online with that.  Of course, like you did for the past year.  Year.  You've been talking about that goddamn Family Dollar for years. 
[02:57:00]  I tried at the Dunkin' Donuts.  Oh, and the Dunkin' Donuts.  All right.  They don't want you.  What do you mean they don't want me?  They haven't called.  Holy shit.  They don't, Lady Di.  They don't want you.  Lady Di, you've got to read this play.  I've got to come up with Eugene O'Neill.  I've got a guy that sits there, he drinks in the bar,  and he says, I'm going out for a walk.  And he never goes out for a walk.  I'll give you a big pickup call.  I love it.  No, really.  I did try a few other places.  What other places? 
[02:57:30]  Yeah, what other places?  Tell us.  Pathmark.  There's an application in there.  They haven't called me.  This was like two weeks ago I applied for this one.  All right.  Okay.  It's still early.  Let me see.  Not exactly Shop.  No, I can't.  No, not ShopRite.  Oh, well.  What, you got something against them?  Pathmark, yes, but not those bastards over at ShopRite.  No.  I don't know.  They're in the Whole Foods.  Yeah.  And I try to go to supermarkets around here. 
[02:58:00]  Ah, supermarkets.  All right.  Yeah.  Try to be a cashier, I see.  Going for the cashier job?  Yes.  Oh, God.  Imagine getting in her line.  What a pain in the ass that would be.  Oh, it's lettuce.  My roommate bought some lettuce the other day.  He's going to make a salad.  That's fantastic.  There's 100 people online waiting to pay.  Oh, God.  Just this babbling idiot.  Slow motion.  Wants to talk about the fucking avocado.  Oh, they're really good this time of year.  You know, my roommate made a guacamole last night. 
[02:58:30]  That was wonderful.  We all got together.  I like to use it as a dip.  With certain things, you just like, fucking ring me up.  This is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.

This is Friends of the Show.  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the Opie and Anthony Show.  This week, Tom Papa's SiriusXM show, Come to Papa.  Come to Papa. 
[03:03:00]  Hello, everybody.  Welcome to Come to Papa.  I am Tom Papa.  I am in Vancouver, British Columbia.  That's in Canada, people.  Where I'm doing a show for the Just for Laughs people.  Lisa, that's the group that does the Montreal Comedy Festival.  And they sent us out on this tour, which I had to bail out on.  And now I am finally made it, and I am in Canada.  And I walk in, and who is here but my good friend comedian, Godfrey.  Hey, hey, hey.  Godfrey and I know each other from back in New York. 
[03:03:30]  He's a hilarious comedian.  You've seen him on a bunch of stuff.  Most recently on the Louis C.K. show.  Yes.  Louis.  He is hilarious.  And he's one of those guys that, as soon as I met him, when I walked into, I think it was Stand Up New York was the first place.  Really?  Because we're comic strip dudes, man.  Or maybe comic strip.  We used to hang out there.  The booth was there.  But I feel like I wasn't into Stand Up New York.  Maybe, maybe, probably.  Whatever it was, I walked in and saw Godfrey. 
[03:04:00]  And there's this good-looking, charismatic guy.  And I was like, oh, he's going to be a superstar.  So then I didn't like him for a while.  No, I always liked Godfrey.  But I really thought, because he's a killer, killer act.  If you can see Godfrey live, you have to follow him on Twitter at GodfreyComedian.  At GodfreyComedian.  And he's always in New York doing a crazy amount of sets.  He's hilarious.  And thank you so much for being here, Godfrey.  Thank you. 
[03:04:30]  Not that you had a choice.  You were in the middle of our first and second show here.  Yes.  On the tour.  And this time, it's so funny, because I did the tour last year with Jim Brewer.  The whole full tour.  Right.  And now I'm doing a little part of this tour.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you ever come on a tour?  Am I?  I, uh...  Did you do some days on the tour I was doing?  I don't remember.  I mean, yeah, well, it's all a blur.  Right.  Because they just use and abuse us regardless.  We're like assembly line copies.  Your first set was good? 
[03:05:00]  Where?  Here?  Yeah, it was fun.  I was watching it from the side.  But it's one of those things where it's not enough time, and you get comfortable, and  that light shows, and you get off at the comma.  I told you to get off at the comma, like, goodnight.  What?  I just have to go.  I know.  Yeah, because, well, this is the thing.  These are these really nice theaters.  You really want, and it's like, oh, these crowds are really good.  You just want to keep going.  Yeah.  But you only get to do 20 minutes.  Remember when 20 minutes, when you first started, it was like, how can I possibly do  20 minutes?  No, first of all, it was like when you had to move from printing to cursive. 
[03:05:30]  When you had to move from printing to cursive in grade school, you're like, wow, cursive?  That looks hard.  I can't do that.  I can't do that.  20 minutes?  20 minutes?  Yeah, 20 minutes used to look like an eternity.  Oh, my God.  Do you remember?  Yeah.  No, you started in Chicago.  Started in Chicago.  I started in Chicago.  I was doing, at first, after college, I was like, okay, I'm going to try this.  Because Tommy Davidson had performed at our school. 
[03:06:00]  I went to the University of Illinois, and he performed, and he was so nice, and we hung  out with me and my buddies.  I still got pictures of that.  Were you a fan of his?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Hell, yeah.  Because in the 90s, man.  In living color.  Oh, my God.  Right?  In living color.  And Jim Carrey was my hero.  I mean, these guys were David Allen Greer, who I'm friends with all these guys now, which  is crazy.  That is a great thing about comedy.  Yeah.  And so, 90s, I meet, you know, I go to the south side of Chicago, because I was on the  north side.  I go to the south side.  They say, hey, man, you want to do some urban comedy, man? 
[03:06:30]  Go see Bernie Mac.  I go over there.  I say, who's Bernie Mac?  I go over to the Cotton Club.  Monday night, he had a variety show.  Right.  I go over there, and I see this guy, a dark-skinned guy with glasses, with a towel, and he's talking  real fast.  Let me tell you something.  Don't give a fuck about all this bullshit.  Motherfuckin' rat.  She eat it.  Motherfuckin' shit, motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker.  Don't give a fuck.  Don't give a fuck.  Don't give a fuck.  Don't give a fuck.  Don't give a fuck.  Don't give a fuck.  Don't give a fuck.  And I was like, he was so goddamn funny.  One of the funniest ever.  One of the funniest, listen, man. 
[03:07:00]  Dude, he's like an uncle, man.  He's like an uncle.  No.  You know?  Oh, you mean just as a guy?  Yeah, he's like an uncle.  Yeah.  Just when you-  It seemed so natural.  Natural.  It seemed like he was just coming off the top of his head.  And by the time I got there and met him, he had already been doing comedy since 1979.  Man.  He had already been in 15, 16 years.  Wow.  Because he started out with Arsenio and these guys.  Arsenio's from Cleveland.  Steve Harvey's from Cleveland.  So these guys had already been in it for 15 years. 
[03:07:30]  Boom.  You understand?  Strong.  So, right.  And so he was like, what's your name?  What's your name?  What do you want?  You want to do comedy?  Are you funny?  I was like, yeah, I'm funny.  He's like, well, you show up next Monday.  Be on time.  You ain't getting no motherfucking time.  You do five minutes.  You get the fuck off.  I was like, okay.  But see-  And what was he doing?  He was running the cotton?  He was running the cotton club with, if you've ever seen the movie Car Wash.  Car Wash, there was a guy, a fat guy named Hippo in the movie.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:08:00]  That was Jimmy Car Wash Spanx.  It was his name.  His real name.  It was him and Bernie Mac.  They were running the show.  So it was singers and comedians.  Me, Dion Cole.  That's how I met Cedric D. Entertainer.  This was the black side of comedy.  That's when I met.  I met D.L. Hughley.  I met Mike Epps before he became my roommate in Queens, New York.  It was Mike Epps.  And also R. Kelly was there because R. Kelly's from Chicago.  R. Kelly, Kanye, Common.  Kanye?  Common? 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  We're all from Chicago, man.  So everyone's just making their way?  Yeah.  Hanging out, making their way, doing their thing.  Oh, yeah, man.  No way.  Yeah, man.  So it was awesome.  Michael Jordan would come because the Bulls in the 90s.  Right.  Michael and Bernie were close.  So was it just packed?  Like it was a hot show?  Oh, my God.  It was just like a hot show.  It was unbelievable.  Really?  It was unbelievable.  It was un-fucking-believable.  How many people?  It was just small.  Like 300 people?  It was a small place.  It packed about 200 people because it was small. 
[03:09:00]  Right.  But it was so cozy and it was just.  Was it intimidating?  Yeah.  As soon as you walk in, Bernie Mac is right there.  The stage and the band are right there.  And so as soon as you walk in, someone would be like, look at this motherfucker.  It was one of those things.  So it was an exciting night because you had Jordan, Ahmad Rashad would be there.  Then it would be, you see all these guys from sports.  It's Scottie Pippen, blah, blah, blah.  Then on the other side, there's pimps, hustlers.  It was like Bishop Don Juan.  You know, they got Bishop Don Juan who hung out with Snoop Dogg. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  It was him because he's from Chicago.  So it was a mixture of people.  There was white people.  It was just because Bernie was the, he was the man, you know?  Wow.  And so I would do that and then I would go to the north side downtown and do the mainstream side because I could do both.  I could do both.  So wait, but go back because this is.  Oh, when I was doing the team?  No, just because Bernie Mac is one of my.  Favorites.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:10:00]  And I don't want to hear more about that room.  I want to hear more.  Like when you first, tell me about your first time when you go in.  I mean, that's an intimidating situation.  Yeah, when I go in, I go in, right?  And he's like, he's like, yeah, so you got five minutes and you got to get the fuck off.  Right.  You got to get the fuck off.  I'm going to play that shit.  You know, blah, blah, blah.  I said, okay.  So I got up.  I did my thing.  I was funny.  Is it, is it, is it a.  It's very intimidating.  Because there's an environment like the Apollo kind of thing.  I kind of.  They'll get you off or is it more welcoming?  It's welcoming, but no one boos.  Right. 
[03:10:30]  Because Bernie doesn't play that shit.  He never liked that.  Of course.  But if you bomb, you fucking bomb.  On your own.  You know what I'm saying?  You bomb on your own.  But there was, it was, okay.  When we went up, there was Bernie.  And then there was a guy named James Hannah.  Mm-hmm.  Who ended up writing for a Steve Harvey show.  There was a lot.  Everybody was funny.  Yeah, yeah.  Everybody was funny, man.  Did you do well enough on your first set?  I did, I did do well enough on my first set because I was, I did a couple of sets on the  north side in the mainstream.  So I was already kind of like, all right, I know what it's like to be on stage.  So I was really funny, man. 
[03:11:00]  I, you know, I can imitate.  I was the first guy to imitate Bernie.  Oh, okay.  Nobody imitated Bernie.  And you did it on a show.  I went in front of him.  And he was like, he goes up, he goes, okay.  I heard a motherfucker can imitate me and shit.  He said, go off and can imitate me.  I heard him be talking like, and he would talk in third person.  Right.  He goes, someone is imitating Bernie Mac.  I don't believe that motherfucker can do it.  Okay, come over here.  So I got up there and said, let me tell you something, Bernie.  I smashed.  I killed.  And Bernie was like, you motherfucker. 
[03:11:30]  Come on, let me show you.  So it's great.  Then when Def Jam came, which was, it was so big because Def Jam was like, that was the  biggest show HBO ever had.  The highest rated.  Right.  Because you go, wait a minute, there's black comics on TV.  Right.  Because, you know, even if you get to improv, I was a big Johnny Carson fan.  Yeah, yeah.  You get to see.  But it wasn't that.  But if you didn't see Cosby or you didn't see like Robert Townsend or if you didn't see  them, there were really no black comics.  Right.  Reno and me.  Or Richard Brown.  Talk about that a little bit because when you're starting out. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  When I'm starting out, it's just, well, I'm just going to comedy clubs and that's where  I go.  Right.  There isn't, there's, but my people have a thing that is going on that these people  don't even know about.  Right.  You're aware of both of these worlds.  Oh, so.  Did you have to make a conscious decision of like, I've got to play both or do I just  go here because it's comfortable or?  I just, I knew, I just, because I've grown up with all kinds of people.  And so the South side, I had friends from the South side. 
[03:12:30]  Right.  I know that world of African Americans.  Right.  You know, that was normal to me.  Right.  And I had a world of, my friends were white.  I had friends from everywhere.  Right.  So I was funny to everybody.  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  So when you started, just.  So it didn't matter to me.  Right, right.  So I just knew I could be myself because I'm this college kid.  Right.  And there's some cats up there.  There's one guy named Dose.  He introduced me to prison comedy.  I did prisons with him.  Oh, really?  Yeah, I did maximum security, men and women's, because he used to be a gangbanger and he 
[03:13:00]  changed his life.  He didn't do it anymore.  And he knew, he knew the people in the jail system.  So he called me up one day, goes, God, man, you want to do some, you want to do prisons?  I said, fuck yeah.  Like Johnny Cash.  Yeah.  I was like, yeah, I want to do that shit.  So I did prisons.  And so these are.  And then I knew guys that went to college, you know, and so I knew I was just funny.  Right.  Because when I was in college, you know, at the cafeteria, we used to hold court because  we'd stay later because I played football. 
[03:13:30]  So, you know, after practice, we'd be, we'd come into the cafeteria later.  So we would sit there just telling jokes and I wouldn't be holding court.  Right.  Telling jokes, doing voices.  Right.  And so this girl that I was dating, I had broken, I broke up with my girlfriend and I was dating  in college.  I was hanging out with this other chick.  It was a rebound.  And one day she just like took down everything I talked about one day.  And she's old.  She, she had it.  I remember her name and it was Toya Dixon.  And she, she held up a sheet of paper.  She goes, this is all the shit that you talked about. 
[03:14:00]  She goes, you should think about doing comedy.  You really should.  Because you're so different and you say things that no one really says.  It's, you need to start.  I go, wait, I go, yeah, you know what?  I will try that shit.  So then when I finished college and I went to Chicago, I met my buddy.  We're hanging out downtown at this little hot dog stand right by, if you've been to Chicago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There's a rock and roll McDonald's that we're known for.  It's in the middle.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  We're sitting at this place right next to it.  And he's like, I said, man, I'm thinking about doing standup comedy. 
[03:14:30]  I saw, I saw Tommy Davidson in my college.  I'm thinking about doing it.  He goes, Hey, his name was Alexander.  He's a six foot six guy.  And he goes, Hey, man, I didn't stand up comedy.  I said, Oh, you did?  He said, there's a, there's an open mic at eight o'clock.  It was like 4 p.m.  He goes, we should just go and do a team thing.  I said, yeah, let's do a team thing.  So we did it.  We signed up.  I remember we had to pick out of a hat and you didn't, whatever number you had, we were  like eight.  There was 10.  There was 10 comics, 10 spots. 
[03:15:00]  We were eight.  That's good.  I remember that was the scariest walk.  Cause I think about it.  I haven't gone home yet.  I decided to write some jokes.  Right.  And then we go to this open mic.  We're not first.  We're eighth.  I, and I thought that, you know, when people shake at the knees, I thought it was cartoons.  I literally, I remember that I was shaking at the knees.  I go, Oh my God, we're on stage.  And it was almost like everything was slow motion.  Oh my God.  You better be funny, motherfucker. 
[03:15:30]  And I still, to this day, whenever I would go to Chicago, I still run into the guy that  knew me when I first went up on stage.  I would see the guy in the street and go, I go, yo man, what's up?  He goes, remember the first day?  So we went up and I remember my first jokes.  My first jokes, cause I could do voices.  I said, right.  You're going to play, he played a hypnotist.  My friend played, he was a very straight, he was a straight, straight man.  Right.  And he played a hypnotist.  He, he hypnotized me into Bill Cosby.  So I was like, you see, and we were getting laughs and I was nervous, got even more nervous. 
[03:16:00]  And so we became like the highlight of open mic.  Right.  So we got invited every, it was a guy.  So it started to happen pretty quickly.  Yeah.  It started to happen pretty quickly.  People were like, yo man, you guys have something.  And then eventually we started opening up for different people.  Then we started doing a lot of the urban comedy, you know, and then, um, one day we were doing  a show.  It was at this place called All Jokes Aside.  It was the number one black comedy club in the country. 
[03:16:30]  In the country?  In the country.  Where, what, in Chicago?  In Chicago.  It was called All Jokes Aside.  That's where I met Jamie Foxx, Sinbad.  I mean, I've known Sinbad for a year.  I met all Mark Curry.  Right.  He was in Penguin.  I mean, I was meeting the echelon of black comedy.  Right.  It was awesome.  Mark, Lord, everybody.  I was like, holy shit, this is awesome.  So then, so then one day we were doing a show and he was drunk and high and I was just  so sick of it.  And Steve Harvey was there and I was just mad in the hallway. 
[03:17:00]  Steve's like, what?  Your guy, your partner was drunk.  He was drunk because he was messing up the show.  You know, and with a duo, you got to be on point with a duo.  Was he, was he drunk and high in the beginning or he just started like part, you're just out  and hanging out?  No, but he wasn't, he didn't handle his shit this time.  I don't mind if you're high or drunk, but just fucking, if you, be a functioning alcohol.  We're doing a show, right?  We're doing a show.  Yeah.  And then I got to still split this weak ass money with you after you're fucking up.  And I was writing most of the sketches, you know, I would come up with ideas.  Yeah.  So then, um, I, Steve Harvey was in the hallway with me. 
[03:17:30]  He said, man, what's the matter, man?  What's wrong?  I said, I'm just tired of this dude, man.  He's always drunk and high.  I don't drink or smoke and he's always fucking up the show.  You know, he goes, he just said, let me ask you something.  He's like, how much money you get?  Um, blah, blah, blah.  Are you tired of getting that money, splitting it with his ass?  Uh, yeah.  You write all the jokes?  Yeah.  Do you got your own shit you've been writing just in case?  Yeah.  I said, yeah.  They cut his ass. 
[03:18:00]  That, I remember this thing.  Cut his, and he just walked off and credits should have rolled.  He was so perfect.  It's just like a Steve Harvey event.  He was like, cut his ass.  Cut his ass.  Steve, Steve, Steve was so memorable to me because Steve was another really strong comic.  Like when he came to Chicago, he sold out.  People knew about Steve and the black people knew Steve Harvey.  Like what?  He was that type of dude.  Everybody came dressed up to see Steve Harvey because he always wore his suits.  And I remember one time, this is when I knew Steve was the coldest dude ever. 
[03:18:30]  He, one guy was heckling Steve and Steve just said, hold on, hold on.  Now, he talks in third person.  He's like, now how in hell you're going to come heckle Steve Harvey?  You see all these people around here, brother?  You see all these people?  Everybody's dressed real nice to come see Steve Harvey.  People done paid their money to see Steve Harvey.  And you got the nerve.  He said, no, no, jokes.  There ain't no jokes no more now.  See, I'm from Cleveland, man.  This is what you don't understand. 
[03:19:00]  He said, when you walked in here, they gave you a chair and me a microphone.  That was a motherfucking clue.  That was the greatest comeback.  Yeah.  I mean, in a place where, you know, in black people.  Yeah.  Right.  Straighten his suit.  Yeah, Steve's like, shit.  Don't ever come in here talking that shit.  You know, I'm in.  Jokes is over.  It was amazing.  It was amazing. 
[03:19:30]  But he was such a professional.  Yeah.  And to come under guys like that, when Bernie Mac, when I seen, when somebody heckled a young comic,  and I seen Bernie Mac chastise an audience.  Yeah.  Because Bernie, Bernie, Steve Harvey, there's another guy named George Wilborn.  It's.  Go ahead.  The way they control the room.  Right.  Well, you see that Bernie Mac, the documentary.  Oh.  Right?  The documentary's called.  Yeah.  I ain't afraid of you, motherfucker.  Right?  That's his death jam. 
[03:20:00]  That was his death.  You know what happened that day, right?  Yeah.  Someone bombed before him.  They bombed.  And the crowd was, as the death jam crowd was.  I ain't afraid of you, motherfucker.  Ripped him apart.  Booing him.  And he came up and said, I ain't afraid of you, motherfucker.  And that's when he comes up.  I ain't afraid of you, motherfucker.  And during the time that he was doing that, he let me host the Cotton Club.  He took me under the swing and said, I want you to host the Cotton Club.  Oh, I hosted for a whole summer.  Comics hated me.  Oh, man.  They hated me.  Bernie asked me. 
[03:20:30]  I didn't know.  He just told me, I want Godfrey to host Cotton Club for summer while I'm on tour of the death jam.  Really?  So I was hosted.  Yeah, I was hosted.  Oh, great.  Oh, yeah.  It was awesome.  And it was like comics were hating.  I didn't give a shit.  So how, you know, whenever you hear people talk about Bernie Mac, and even in that documentary,  they were saying, you know, he just tells stories and it's just from his life and all  that kind of stuff.  But he had been an act for a while.  I mean, it was.  Yeah.  He was a solid act.  He was a solid act.  He was always funny. 
[03:21:00]  Always funny.  Like when you saw that documentary, it was so funny because I was on some of those shows.  Oh, yeah.  Like there was one where he had an HBO thing called Midnight Mac.  They were trying to do HBO shows.  I did some sketches.  I played in some sketches.  He put me in some sketches.  But it never, like it wasn't successful.  Right.  And then they show him in another scene where he's doing, he had a jazz show.  I did that show.  Wow.  And I remember those days.  So great.  I remember.  Oh, my God.  And I talked to your buddy, Matt Damon. 
[03:21:30]  Uh-huh.  I saw him on the street with Brian Copeland.  Uh-huh.  And I was going to the gym on 59th Street.  Uh-huh.  And I saw Brian.  I go, hey, Brian, what's up?  How did you know Brian?  Brian from Gary Goldman.  Oh, okay.  We met at a Starbucks.  I was with my girlfriend.  I was talking about writing.  And Brian was like, hey, man, you know, and he was like, this is my friend Brian.  He wrote rounders, blah, blah, blah.  I said, oh.  He goes, man, you just got to, like, start writing your own stuff.  Even if you can't, you just got to put your effort into it.  Sometimes you got to write yourself in.  Right.  You know, it's hard.  You just got to.  So he gave me this advice. 
[03:22:00]  So Brian's always been really nice to me.  And so I saw Brian on the corner.  I was going to the gym.  And I said, hey, man, what's up?  And I see this dude with a hat talking to him.  Uh-huh.  And I come up.  I go, oh, shit, it's Matt Damon.  And so Matt, you know, Matt, he's just a cool, regular dude.  Yeah.  And then, you know, he introduces me.  He goes, man, this is a really funny comic, Godfrey.  And he goes, you're a comic.  I go, yeah, I'm from Chicago, blah, blah, blah.  He goes, yeah, I said, I started with Bernie.  I go, Bernie, Matt?  I go, yeah, Bernie.  I go, I said, Matt, not to be me, but I knew Bernie before you. 
[03:22:30]  But it was really kick-ass how much he revered Bernie.  Oh, man, how would you not?  The love that he had for Bernie.  But I go, go ahead.  What's amazing is, like, when you mentioned, like, Bernie and Steve Harvey, and they were  so huge on the scene.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was the strength.  They had, like, this power.  Power, right.  And it seems to me, from the outside, that playing those black rooms, you had to not only  be funny, but you had to be dominant.  You had to dominate.  Right.  You had to show the crowd that you were not afraid of. 
[03:23:00]  Because you were fearless.  Because that's the thing about the urban rooms, it's like, for me, it was just, it was just  about having courage, like, giving you just, like, attitude.  Right.  It was attitude.  And with the difference between mainstream comedy and urban comedy, it's all about the  emcee.  The emcee, it's his room.  Right.  If you kill, like, if you kill, they'll be like, shit, you don't come in my room doing  that shit.  My turn.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  It's about, see, you know, on the mainstream, it's not about the emcee. 
[03:23:30]  It's about, hey, let's bring up the act.  Right, right, right.  Fuck that.  Urban rooms, I'm doing 20 minutes in between each act.  Right.  Yeah.  Which is funny, because you and I were both hosting at the Comedy Cellar.  Right.  A lot.  Yes, when we first started.  A lot.  And we were both really awesome.  And I have to say, we kind of treated it that way.  We did.  We made it an hour.  It was like, right, it was like, this was my show.  Like, whenever I would come in, you'd be just like, this is Godfrey's show.  And it was the only time, like, when my friends would come and watch it, or to be coming 
[03:24:00]  through town, and they'd be like, no other time would they say, the host was really  the best guy.  I made sure, because that was the training I got from Bernie Mac.  Right.  Bernie Mac, and there's another guy, I don't want to leave him out, named George Wilborn.  He was the host, he was the house emcee of All Jokes Aside.  Uh-huh.  He was like, it was Bernie, George, these were the big Chicago guys.  And George really looked out for me, got me into that club.  Oh.  Got me into All Jokes Aside.  That's another guy.  Yeah.  You talk about a motherfucker destroying. 
[03:24:30]  Oh, yeah?  He's the kind of guy, like, him and Bernie are the kind of guys that can control the audience.  Uh-huh.  If he doesn't like you, George will bring you up and go, yeah, this next guy, and the audience,  you'll bomb.  I don't give a fuck how good, if George doesn't like you, the audience will bring you up.  Where's George now?  George is, he was on a syndicated show, the Michael Basin Show.  Uh-huh.  Now George is starting to headline, he does radio.  Oh, okay.  He does radio, but he was on Montreal last year.  Oh, yeah?  And I introduced him to everybody, because this is my big brother right here. 
[03:25:00]  And is he still a killer?  Yeah.  Man, he's so likable.  Uh-huh.  He's very Chicago, South Side, but when you meet him, you'll go, I fucking love, George  is the most giving.  Right.  I never forget that guy.  Yeah, yeah.  And I learned how to MC from those guys.  I not only had my mainstream, because that's what Bernie, this, I gotta, I gotta, so you  gotta be going off.  This is another thing.  There was another guy named Evan Lionel.  Uh-huh.  Another guy from Chicago.  Killer.  Uh-huh.  He's another guy that took me under his wing.  It was, it was, it was, it was Evan, George, Bernie. 
[03:25:30]  They all knew each other.  Uh-huh.  Evan used to house Bernie and his wife when Bernie was homeless.  Oh, yeah.  Evan helped Bernie.  Wow.  You see?  Right.  And Evan has a show in LA that he's had for long.  There's an urban show.  It's singing, and he's always been under the rain.  He's been in LA for 20-something years.  He never really got super huge, but he's a Chicago dude.  And still doing it?  He always threw his own shows. 
[03:26:00]  I used to do his shows.  Now, him and Bernie fell out.  Oh, yeah.  Something happened, they fell out, and then Bernie died.  Right.  And he never got to, uh, it's too bad.  It's fucked up.  Yeah.  Anyway, I learned how to host from these guys.  So I had the mainstream shit, and I had that urban attitude.  Right.  And the combination is nasty, you know?  Yeah.  So, I remember Bernie, it was 3 in the morning.  Like, 3 o'clock in the morning, we're at the Cotton Club.  It's me, Bernie, his wife. 
[03:26:30]  Bernie's drunk.  And Evan.  It's just us.  Uh-huh.  And so, Bernie just started going, who's going to carry that motherfucking torch?  Huh?  Who's going to carry that motherfucking torch?  You motherfucking comedians.  Motherfuckers.  The motherfuckers, they try to be Bernie Mac.  They try to steal and shit.  They try to, he was getting angry.  Oh, yeah.  And then he goes, this is what I like about Godfrey, man.  Because you're versatile.  I remember that shit.  You're versatile.  He said, you can go, you can do a whole room full of white people, Chinese people.  You can do pimps, hoes.  It don't matter.  You can be yourself.  You're the same person.  He always shows it, dude. 
[03:27:00]  And then Keith Robinson, you know Keith Robinson, my friend.  Keith went on tour with Bernie.  Yeah.  So, one day, Keith calls me.  He's on tour.  And he's like, hey, man.  He goes, hey, Godfrey, man.  Yeah.  I was just talking to Bernie about you.  And Bernie's showing you love, man.  And then I talked down on the phone with Bernie.  He said, what you doing?  I'm proud of you.  I said, I told you, Keith.  I wasn't lying.  Oh, yeah, man.  I was really.  That is huge.  Yeah.  I was.  Oh, that's great. 
[03:27:30]  And then to see him blow up like that, to be hanging out with George Clooney.  And those are, Brad Pitt.  Yeah.  And his own show.  He was an unknown.  I remember when he first got in GQ, he was on the back of GQ.  Right.  And they were going, who is this unknown superstar that's on the south side of Chicago?  Right.  And then finally, he's on the front of GQ.  Wow.  You're listening to Come to Pop on Sirius XM 99.  I'm in Vancouver, British Columbia, backstage in the bowels of this theater. 
[03:28:00]  Bowels.  In between shows.  We just finished our first show.  We're going to go into our second.  And I'm here with my good friend, Godfrey.  Follow him on Twitter at GodfreyComedian.  Yes.  And he's always out there doing tons of shows.  I'm ready to take it to the next level, you know?  Well, you know what?  This is the thing.  I'm ready to take it to the next level.  No, this is the thing.  Because when people saw Bernie Mac and those guys early on, everyone in Chicago knew this  guy was special, right?  Yes.  And 20 years later, the rest of the world finds out. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, yeah.  Right?  And like I said, when I first met you, and people say this a lot, it's not just me.  When they first met you, it was like, oh, this guy's special.  And where are we at now?  Maybe, are we at 20 years?  18.  18?  18.  18 years.  So, maybe.  Maybe.  Because I know Greg Fitzsimmons always says it.  He goes, I don't get it.  Because, you know, people had expectations for me.  And you know, in this business, things are up and down. 
[03:29:00]  I mean, I've had, don't get me wrong, there's victories you celebrate.  You go, I was this.  I did that.  Right.  And there's still things that people go, God, I know.  But I'm still looking at things that I still want to accomplish.  Of course.  I was saying this to a friend of mine.  Yeah.  You go home and you talk to your buddies that you went to school with.  And they're like, oh my God, you're a huge star.  And then, in your own mind, you're like, I haven't done anything to a shit.  But the reality is somewhere in between.  Yeah.  Because you have done a bunch of stuff. 
[03:29:30]  Yes.  But you have so much further to go.  Yeah.  To meet your potential and where you actually want to take this career.  But you have to kind of acknowledge, oh, I'm doing all this stuff and I'm going into these places.  And the other part of it is, if you were just an actor and you do things and you, but as  a comedian, the whole time while things in the public are happening, you're just getting  stronger and stronger and working and interacting and becoming a great comedian. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  That's the power of being a comedian.  Comedy.  You have this trade, basically.  Yeah.  That you are perfecting and getting stronger and stronger.  But dude, when you think that there's just this sort of, I don't, first of all, comedy  still isn't respected as an art form.  The Academy Awards will tell you that.  It's not respected as an art form.  Because I think if you do a wonderful comedic performance, you should be, you should be  given an Oscar.  Yeah.  If you do a wonderful, you shouldn't always be because you're crying in a scene. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  You know, it's hard.  Playing someone in a wheelchair.  Really?  What if we're going to have to play comedians in a wheelchair?  Yeah.  I just think that it's still not respected as an art form.  There's this kind of, because I, here's an example.  I went out for this part, you know, Alan Arkin's son.  Oh, yeah.  He was the director or whatever.  He was watching me do my thing.  It was not too long ago.  I auditioned.  It was kind of a serious role.  Yeah.  To play opposite Morris Chestnut.  It was Trinor's Jackie and shit, right? 
[03:31:00]  Right.  So, and so I did the part.  I mean, I'm pretty good at auditioning.  I've been in 18 years.  I'm a pretty good auditioner.  I ask questions.  Hey, what do you want from this?  Do you want me to try it?  Okay.  Boom.  I do my thing.  Forget about it.  There's a lot of people going in.  So I just go, all right.  So I go back to my house and then my agent's like, hey, man, what's up?  Did anything wrong happen at the audition?  I said, no.  Why?  I said, the dude commented on my t-shirt that I had a really, I was wearing a Steve McQueen t-shirt. 
[03:31:30]  He's like, oh, that's a nice t-shirt.  I said, oh, okay, thanks.  And blah, blah, blah.  And they go, because they said that you nailed it.  They said you really did well, but that you comedianed your way out of the part.  And I go, well, first of all, that's a fucked up thing to say because I didn't get that.  What does that mean?  I don't.  Thank you.  Exactly.  You comedian?  I comedian.  I said, I don't understand.  I don't get what that means.  I think it's like, it's either I got it or I didn't get it.  I comedian my way.  Did that mean when, outside of when you were reading? 
[03:32:00]  No, I didn't do anything.  They didn't, outside, I just left.  I got my shit and left.  And your guy didn't know what that meant either?  I didn't, I was like, what does that mean?  I said, this is what my point is, is that it seems like there's this jealousy of comedians.  When people know you're a comedian, they go, oh, here comes this comedian.  Right.  You know, and I go, excuse me.  Right.  I take so much pride in being a comedian.  Fuck you.  You can't do what we do.  But we can do what the fuck you do, my friend.  You want to ask Robin Williams? 
[03:32:30]  You want to ask Whoopi Goldberg?  You want to ask Kevin Pollack?  You want to ask Michael Keaton?  We can keep going.  Right.  Richard Pryor was a fucking good actor.  Yeah.  Please, and save that shit, because you don't know how to fucking do it.  I mean, I won't get, I won't any day get in an argument with any of these.  I don't give a fuck who you are.  Right.  And it was like, comedian my way out of it.  I've taken, I've gone to acting school.  Yeah.  I've taken a lot of classes.  Yeah.  You know?  So you think just because you had the moniker of being a comedian.  Yeah.  Because I didn't do anything wrong.  I was like, I was like, I told my, I said, first of all, I don't fuck around like that. 
[03:33:00]  Yeah.  I go in, I do my thing, and that's it.  If I shake hands with the person, I just do that, and I sit down, and I go, and I ask  questions like in my acting class.  You make the audition yours.  Right.  I don't know that I'm going to get it.  Right.  Why not make it the best?  Yeah.  Make it as comfortable as I can.  Have an experience with it.  Period.  Leave your product in the room.  I know my shit.  Yeah.  I'm like, just, hey, I didn't get it.  Now, I comedic, it was like an unnecessary thing to say.  I was really pissed off about that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I said, this is what I mean.  I think there's a jealousy of comics, because we are our own brand. 
[03:33:30]  We create our own selves.  We can always recreate, and we stay the longest damn near.  Well, that's right.  You know?  That's because you have this craft.  I think it's like athletic talent.  Who wouldn't want to be LeBron James?  Who the fuck wouldn't be able to want to hit a home run?  And that's why fanatics, fans, and shit on athletes.  Fuck, you suck.  They wish they could do.  No, they don't suck.  Right.  Whether they lose or not, they're all better than us.  Right.  Everybody that's on the field is better than us. 
[03:34:00]  Right.  Everybody.  The guy sitting on the bench, he's better than us.  He throws 95.  Yeah.  And we're sitting up there with their jersey on, talking shit.  Right.  The paradox.  You know what I mean?  I think it's the same way that some of these dramatic actors treat us.  When I see you're a comedian, they automatically go, come in.  I go, but you don't understand.  Come in.  Being a comic is such a serious thing.  Right.  It's more serious than you're being funny.  Oh, you're working 24 hours a day. 
[03:34:30]  24 hours a day to find the right word for a joke to please.  Yeah.  These are the same ones.  These are the same people that go, Cosby.  And I go, no, we do the same thing.  Right, exactly.  And so when he said that, I just was like, fuck that.  That's a weird comment.  Well, it's weird because what's weird about it is that you're not left with what exactly  he meant.  I didn't know what he meant.  You don't know if he meant the way you said hello and goodbye, or if it was in the middle  of when you were reading your lines, but whatever it is.  I said, please, if my acting sucked good. 
[03:35:00]  They said I nailed it, though.  That's the thing.  And it was like, but he comedians.  I go, I just didn't get the part.  Yeah.  That would, maybe, because sometimes I think they look at your resume, they look at it,  and they'll see maybe, oh, he was in the Just for Laughs.  They see stand-up.  I go, that's pride right there, buddy.  Yeah, of course.  And these are the same ones that'll be like, Bernie Mac.  I go, Bernie's a comic.  Right.  He's a comic, man.  Right.  Keep your mouth shut.  Right.  Fuck out of here. 
[03:35:30]  Well, all it takes is the right person in that world to say, I see it in you, and you  can do it, and I'll let you do it.  Well, a guy like Louis C.K., which I have so much love for that guy, because he put me  in his show twice.  I didn't ask.  He just put me, I didn't have to audition.  Right.  He just goes, I want you to do this, because you're good at that.  Right.  He lets you be you.  Right, right, right.  He loves comics.  He goes, man, you can make anything funny.  I want you to do this thing.  You have, you, you're good at, you're a good actor. 
[03:36:00]  Right.  And that's, that's it.  Yeah, that's it.  That's who you need.  I don't need these.  And, you know, and the listeners to my program know what a good actor you are, because you're  on the Come to Pop Alive from Village Underground.  Oh, yes!  I think I'm doing pretty good.  You're doing great.  I'm so upset that you're not around to do more, because there are guys that, when you  write this stuff, and you, you know, I put all these guys in, like, I put William Stevenson 
[03:36:30]  in every time, and I know that he's going to play a bed bug, or a turkey, or whatever,  and he brings his attitude and does it.  And I, the greatest part about doing these live shows is that I know when I, I write the  script, I get as funny as possible, and then I hand it to these comedians, and when they're  on stage, if the material's not funny enough for them, they're going to just take it over,  they're going to make it funnier.  Right.  So, it's the, almost, and the easiest writing job in the world.  No, of course.  And you think of, and anytime you've been on the show, you go on in, you just, you put 
[03:37:00]  things in that I didn't even write, and you knock it out of the park, and it's great  for the show.  They walk to the stage with you.  And when you think about that, then it's natural.  It's like, well, of course, television shows, should, all the great television comedies  had comedians in them, because, because there's such a voice.  I mean, the thing, the thing that I think we have to keep in mind is, all those guys that  really broke and made really great shows have been doing it for a long time.  Yeah. 
[03:37:30]  It's, we went through a period where people were getting shots really early, but that  doesn't sustain, because you don't know a real story.  But nowadays, it's getting really bad.  And everybody's, it's like, I'm not trying to knock the alternative scene.  It's gotten to a point where it's like, dude, I believe in, like, I take comedy as a sport.  You hit the ball, you play.  Right.  You know, I don't give a fuck what your windup is.  You got to throw strikes, buddy.  Right.  These people are not fun.  It's like, they're not, it's like not being funny is like, what's in? 
[03:38:00]  Right.  I go, I'm sorry, but, I'm sorry, but I worked for Cosby.  You know, I was in warmup for Cosby.  Right.  To watch Cosby do comedy every Thursday.  Yeah.  And I'm watching some fucker in a flannel shirt go, but y'all, you know, weird, y'all,  no punchline.  Get the fuck out of here.  And then they get a show.  And then you come into a room full of people and you pitch a show and they're looking at  you like you got two fucking heads.  And you want to turn the fucking table over.  Like, are you fucking kidding?  Do I need Joe Pesci right now? 
[03:38:30]  Right.  It's like, I wish I was in the Sinatra days where Sinatra would be like, you're going  to give him a show or, or else, or I'm going to break your fucking legs.  You're going to, I need that because it's like, I, I'm not, I'm not going to let the,  I'm not going to let people think I'm irrelevant.  I go, no, I watch, I'm a, I grew up on TV.  Right.  I think we all did.  Yeah.  I'm Johnny Carson is my fucking hero.  Right.  Like I used to think watching Johnny Carson, like I lived through that show.  I was like, man, entertainment must be so great. 
[03:39:00]  Yeah.  To Don Rinkles, David Brenner, Jonathan Winters, Bill Cozzi all sitting together laughing.  And Johnny would be like, wow, good stuff.  That was good.  They're going to be a star.  Wow.  I would imitate him.  Yeah.  I practiced Johnny Carson.  Yeah.  I was nine, 10 years old and I'd stay up late knowing I had to go to school.  My father thought I had insomnia.  He'd be like, you go to bed.  What are you doing still up?  You have to go.  I go, I have to see Johnny Carson.  I would watch Johnny Carson and the Honeymooners on a sneak. 
[03:39:30]  Right.  Yeah.  I was like, fuck that.  And I had to watch the monologue.  I had to watch his monologue.  And, and, and you're going to tell me that all that comedy that I grew up on, I'm not fun.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  You know, this alternative shit.  And listen, I'm not talking about the good alternative guys.  No, no.  There's good.  There's great.  There's half alternative now.  Right.  Right.  Everybody's just like, yeah.  But that stuff doesn't sustain.  I mean, it may get you a bit hard on something, but it's not going to.  But these motherfuckers are getting shows left to right. 
[03:40:00]  And listen, sometimes I'll go, hey man, I'm going to try and watch some of these shows  and see if they're good.  Listen, man.  I know I'm not crazy.  I'm like, I know funny.  Funny.  You can be funny in your 80s.  Right.  You don't lose that.  You don't lose what's funny in your 80s.  That's not.  Yeah.  No.  I'm like, fuck that.  Yeah.  And I, and it's like, they want to always say, oh, you're bitter.  I'm not bitter.  I like funny people.  Right.  And it's like, black and white people are not funny anymore.  Right.  Everybody stinks. 
[03:40:30]  Except, and it feels good when I see, like, when I see you coming up and I see you getting  on shit.  I see a guy like Louis C.K., Bill Burr.  Finally.  Right.  They're starting to like open the gates because the gatekeepers are these motherfuckers that  are.  Right.  I don't know what they're doing.  Well, they're looking for different quirky things.  It's all right to be quirky.  Please.  Judah Friedlander was alternative before a lot of these motherfuckers, man.  And he's still trying to get his footing.  Yeah.  Come on.  And Judah's funny than a motherfucker, man.  Yeah. 
[03:41:00]  Alternative, really?  But the thing is, if you, if you're able to not let it bother you.  That's right.  Because you don't want to, because the one thing you've got to be careful about is not  letting it darken the light.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because you have a light and you have this lightness that you come into a room with.  And is it too much?  Is it too much?  Huh?  I mean, is it too much?  Is what too much?  Can I tell you what Daryl Hammond told me?  Uh-huh.  You know Daryl Hammond. 
[03:41:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Daryl is, dresses in black.  He's the man in black.  Not only Johnny Cash.  Daryl Hammond.  Hey, you know how Daryl talks.  Godfrey, I want to talk to you for a second.  He's like, I've been wanting to talk to you for the longest time.  Do you know, Godfrey, that I was at your audition for Saturday Night Live?  You know he was at my audition.  Oh, yeah.  This was 98, 97.  Uh-huh.  Me, Jimmy Fallon, Tracy Morgan.  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  I auditioned.  Comic strip.  Right?  I went in.  I smashed it. 
[03:42:00]  Uh-huh.  Did four characters.  They made four characters.  I went in.  Bah, bah.  I said, this is SNL.  Mm-hmm.  Andy Murphy was on SNL.  I have a chance.  Yeah, yeah.  So I came in, I was prepared, I smashed it, almost standing ovation.  Yeah.  And, you know, usually I don't get super confident.  Yeah.  I know, you know, usually I was using something.  You know what you do, right?  I was like, I mean, I high-fived my management.  They were like, yeah, I think you might go to the next stage.  I go, dude, I can't be beat.  That was, who's going to fuck with that?  Right.  I didn't even make it to the first stage. 
[03:42:30]  Right.  The second stage, they didn't call me back.  I was so, like, I thought I wasn't shit.  Uh-huh.  You know, I was like, fuck, man.  They gave it to Tracy Morgan.  I was so mad because I remember his set was weaker than mine.  Right.  And I'm thinking nothing from Tracy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I was so mad.  And then, yeah, Daryl tells me.  And then I did a table.  So he's there.  Yeah, I did a table read with Colin Quinn at the Saturday Night Live studios.  And I was reading.  It was me, Horatio Sanz, all of them were reading. 
[03:43:00]  I played four characters.  Marcy Klein.  Yeah, yeah.  She comes up to me and says, what's your name?  What's your name?  I'm like, who is this crazy?  And Colin was like, that's Marcy Klein, man.  She doesn't do that.  She goes, you're so talented.  Give me your information.  I sent my information.  I guess I told my agent.  Yeah, Marcy Klein approached me.  They never responded to me again.  So this is twice.  Right.  So I'm like, fuck, man.  So then, remember T-Shawn Shannon? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He wanted me to come back and audition for SNL.  He was a big fan of mine.  And he goes, I want you to come back.  And I go, no, I'm good, man.  I can't get teased like that.  It's too much.  I don't want to do it anymore.  And so I stopped coming through doing audition.  And then Daryl comes into me.  He says, yeah, man, I was at your audition.  You killed.  You were the best thing that night.  He goes, but I knew you wouldn't get it.  I was sitting next to Lauren.  I said, what?  I was sitting next to Lauren. 
[03:44:00]  I knew you wouldn't get it.  You were too much.  It was too much.  He couldn't.  They were like, it was too much.  It was too perfect.  It was too much.  He kept saying, you know, Lauren's not a racist.  He's like, his bosses are GE.  I said, GE?  I mean, he goes, you were too much, man.  They couldn't have you, a black dude like yourself, outshine the other.  What?  Yes.  You mean being too strong as a black man?  Being strong.  Do you see what, remember what Eddie Murphy did to SNL? 
[03:44:30]  Uh-huh.  And it was supposed to be Charlie, what's his name, from DC Cab?  Oh, Charlie Murphy?  No, not Charlie Murphy.  The other guy.  The other comic that they should all love so much.  Right, right.  From Charlie.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, I know, I know.  He couldn't read, and that's how Eddie Murphy got Saturday night.  Right, right.  Well, Eddie was under Dick Ebersole.  Uh-huh.  That was, that Lauren wasn't there.  Dick Ebersole was producing.  And that's how Eddie got in.  Oh. 
[03:45:00]  And Eddie took, remember Eddie was, oh my God.  Yeah.  SNL, you run to the TV.  Oh, you changed it.  Yeah.  Right.  Yeah.  From there on, all the black dudes that have come on there have been, Tim Meadows, Jerry Minor.  Right.  They've been, eh, kind of, mm.  Uh-huh.  Not like Eddie Murphy's effect.  Right.  Remember how versatile Eddie was?  Yeah.  A Jewish guy, a white guy.  Nowadays, the black dudes that are on there just play black dudes.  They're just black.  Right.  And then the thing that Kenan said, remember what Kenan said about black women? 
[03:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, recently.  Are you surprised?  Right.  Are you surprised?  And it's fucked up.  Right.  You know, so, Daryl said, yeah, I knew you weren't going to get it.  Because it was too much.  It was like, you were so perfect and so articulate, bam, good looking, boo, boo, boo.  Nah.  Daryl, and I'm in my head.  That's crazy.  Yeah.  Daryl haven't told me this.  Daryl doesn't talk to people.  Right.  No, he doesn't.  Daryl doesn't talk to people. 
[03:46:00]  No, he doesn't.  Daryl came to me and said, man, because, you know.  Here's something, here's something that I find crazy.  And, like, when I watch black performers, yourself, you know, great, greer, yeah, I mean,  maybe, yeah, maybe, yeah.  It's so, it's so scary because you're so good. 
[03:46:30]  There's a freedom, and I'm saying this with a complete compliment.  Dude, listen.  There is, like, keep it real.  So, black females, black males.  Males, yeah.  When I see a comic like yourself go into a club and destroy, there is something that,  not that other white performers can't do it, but a lot of them can't.  There's a, there's a, almost like an innate entertainer quality that Bernie had, Steve Harvey had. 
[03:47:00]  Like, there's that thing that, like, there's that thing that is, and it may just come because I was raised in a white suburb.  Suburb, right.  And wasn't around the culture as much.  Yeah.  But, even, I know show business.  Yeah, yeah.  And you know when you go into a room and someone has crazy skills.  Skills.  There, and it's just versatile.  And, you know, it's the people.  Like, there's the people, you know, you go to a birthday party for white people, it's very different than a birthday party for black people.  People can sing.  Right.  There's Spanish people. 
[03:47:30]  It's free.  It's a big personality.  It's a cultural difference.  That's right.  And when you put that into show business, it always seems to me like it's just so dominant.  Like, it's just so dominant.  And when I hear African-American comics say, no, it's hard, like, it's hard to be a black man in show business.  To me, I'm always like, no, I wish I had that.  I wish I had that. 
[03:48:00]  When I was in high school, I had one of those little things like Baby on Board that said, proud to be black.  And I would listen to rap and I wanted it so badly.  And when I see it just from a performance aspect, I think, oh, if I could be black, I could be a superstar.  But as you hear that, it's kind of a story.  For Daryl Hammond.  Daryl Hammond.  No, but is it, but is it, and this is the question.  Yeah.  Do you think that it's a systemic thing that in show business, like, there's, you know, it's hard to sing because there's black stuff that I've auditioned for that I was like, that I never get chosen. 
[03:48:30]  For, you know, because I've always been, I've always been that guy in the middle.  Right.  I've always, and this is a funny thing.  I used to, I don't know where I want to put this, but I'm not, I'm not black enough for black people.  I'm not black enough for white people.  You know, it used to be, I'm too black.  I'm not black enough for white people.  I'm not black enough for black people.  Right.  I've always been just Godfrey.  Right.  It's just, that's, because people treat me as Godfrey. 
[03:49:00]  Right.  Even when people make a racial comment about me, they don't even feel good about it.  Right, right.  It's like saying, yo, you know, Cosby, that black dude?  You don't say black dude Cosby, you say Cosby.  Right.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  That's why, that's why it's like, it's almost like, you know, like if you say, you don't  have black dude Lil Wayne, yeah, the black dude Lil Wayne, you know what I mean?  Like when you say, oh, the black dude, when you say something, it's like, I don't, I don't.  So do you carry that with you?  Like when, I mean, that's one story from Daryl Hyman about SNL, but do you feel like when 
[03:49:30]  you go out and audition, are you always carrying?  I mean, it's.  I carry this.  I carry.  No, it's not a silly question.  I carry that thing over my head, like, I don't think they're going to want me, you  know what I mean?  Especially if it's a sketch.  You as a person or you as a black person?  Oh, me as a performer.  Uh-huh.  Or as a, I don't think.  But does that come from race or does that just come from you?  I, I don't know, man, because it's hard to say because I think it's just me as a person 
[03:50:00]  because people can't figure me out or I'm too much or, you know, because I'm, but this  is a thing, like those, like black comics, like strong black comics that are black, I  can hang with them or I just usually blow them off the water.  Like you were hosting for Bernie Mac.  I mean, yeah, I'm like, please, dude.  But sometimes I'm not in that clique of black people.  Right, right.  They don't always choose me for shit.  You see where I'm coming from?  Yeah, yeah.  But then when I do get on something, they go, damn, dog, wow. 
[03:50:30]  Right.  I go, but I was always like that.  Right.  But I'm not like, like, and I'm not knocking all these, like Kevin Hartz and the,  and, and they, uh, who else can I name?  Kevin Hartz and all those dudes that they pick.  I'm not always, like when I did Soul Plane.  Right.  I was one of the funniest characters on there.  Right.  I, I decided in the audition, I said, I'm going to play an African.  Uh-huh.  I, I, I totally went against the, I said, I'm going to play an African because everybody's  doing the same ghetto shit.  Smart.  I think if I play an African, it'll be funny if it's me and Snoop. 
[03:51:00]  Right.  It'll be such an opposite thing.  I did that and I got the job in the room.  Wow.  They were like, that's so much funnier.  I said, but that's how I've always approached comedy.  Right.  Right.  I always approached it from a different angle because I always thought like that.  My father was a thinker.  Right.  My parents, I'm an immigrant.  My parents are immigrants.  Right.  I mean, I'm Nigerian American.  Right.  That's, that's where my arsenal came from.  Right.  Well, and, and Colin Quinn sat me down this one day.  He said, you got to start talking about that.  Cause I started working on my father's stuff at the, at the Boston comedy club where I was 
[03:51:30]  doing Tuesday nights.  Yeah.  With that Greek dude.  He had a shitty Tuesday night.  Right.  And I started talking about my dad and Colin was sitting one day, one day there.  He goes, that is what is going to separate you from everybody.  Right.  And I think the fact that I talk about this African thing, it gave me more arsenal because  I used to get approached, like some black comics used to be like, Oh man, you think  you're white?  You act like a white dude.  They used to tell me that.  And I used to go, wait a minute.  And I used to check them.  I go, okay, let me see how I'm a white guy. 
[03:52:00]  Okay.  What's your last name?  Smith.  What's my last name?  Exactly.  Your name's white.  Mine's African.  Right.  But they, they, but they judge your blackness by your cadence.  Oh, interesting.  By your cadence.  Right.  You get on stage, you go, Hey, what's up everyone?  Oh, my phone.  What up?  That's how you enter black comedy.  What up?  Yeah.  What's up motherfuckers?  I always went like this.  Hey guys, what's up?  I did it on purpose because black people are conditioned. 
[03:52:30]  It's like a dog.  Like when they hear a certain sound, they salivate like that Pavlov shit.  But I would do it on purpose to throw them up and go, Oh man, this dude's going to be corny.  But then I'm smashing, you know, I do not, because I always liked opposites.  I always liked that.  I was different.  I always liked to throw people off.  That was what I liked.  I kind of liked that, you know, this will be real.  Racism helps comedy. 
[03:53:00]  Racism helps.  I mean, destruction helps comedy.  You know what Carlin said?  He said, I love when shit's fucked up.  Right.  This is how we work.  Right.  You know, I don't want to see some like race car driving.  I want to see some cars crashing into the audience.  I want to see some bodies on fire.  Right.  You know, I want to see a bunch of fucking rednecks going around in a circle.  You know what I mean?  And I like that people judge me as a black comic.  They think I'm going to say something.  Oh, he's a black comic.  He'll probably talk about this.  Right.  And I go totally opposite. 
[03:53:30]  Yeah.  I love that.  That's why I became a comic.  Right.  Not because I was funny.  I had funny friends.  Yeah, yeah.  But I came because my thinking was different.  Right.  My thinking was different.  I was raised with a mom that knew every black and white movie she could name.  And I was a kid that can go, oh, that's Marlena Dietrich.  Right.  That's a good book.  No, that's a Cary Grant, real name Archibald Leach.  I knew that.  Right.  Because my mother taught me that. 
[03:54:00]  Right.  Tis and Kane.  Right.  Come on.  I knew every, I mean, my father's favorite film has been her.  He really thinks that fucking Moses, but this is what I grew up on.
