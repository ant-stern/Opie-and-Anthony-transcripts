<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Anthony recounting a minor car accident, leading to a discussion about inflated cab repair costs and a humorous, offensive exchange involving ethnic stereotypes and accents fueled by a listener call.  Producer Rick returned from his wedding, prompting a Crocodile Hunter impersonation.  This was followed by a bizarre call from a "Corky Steinbrenner" impersonator, featuring rambling jokes and a song about killing kittens.  An Elvis impersonator called, initially praised for his CD, but vehemently refused a challenge to perform while seated on the toilet – a proposition stemming from Elvis’ bathroom death.  The segment ended with the hosts playing his CD. A prank call to a library requesting obscene children’s books and a "Stoner Spelling Bee" segment followed, with a caller failing to spell "inebriated."  The show continued with discussions of Star Jones’s underwhelming Hamptons barbecue and a listener’s disastrous Woodstock experience, featuring graphic descriptions of filth and bodily fluids.  A picture of a staff member in a bra and a "Whip Them Out Wednesday" segment with an explicit song concluded this portion.

The next section covered their last day before vacation, marked by anxieties about being forgotten and a lack of show preparation.  A major discussion ensued about Howard Stern's activities at a Fat Boy Slim concert, focusing on Stern dancing with young women and sexual activity in a private box.  Callers Scott and Sal shared their concert experiences, leading to a discussion about Fat Boy Slim's originality and humorous accusations of musical theft.  A "worst of" segment followed, including a song about wedding frustrations, sexually explicit Hillary and Chelsea on safari jokes, and vulgar Star Wars-themed jokes.  The hosts played and mocked songs from Barry Williams’ new CD, interspersed with calls expressing disgust.  A call from Joe Pesci promoting his rap album was played.  The segment ended with a heated argument between Opie, Anthony, and Rick, involving Opie's girlfriend's comments on his sexual performance, his relationship with Rick's sister, and escalating threats of violence.

The broadcast continued with a detailed description of a physical altercation between Opie and Rick, including grappling, punches, and alleged crotch-in-face contact.  Andrew Dice Clay then called, engaging in a furious, insult-laden exchange with Anthony over Anthony's Dice impersonations, referencing Dice's career and legal threats.  Multiple callers joined in.  The show then focused on Kathy Lee Gifford’s alleged braless appearances, using graphic sexual descriptions and fantasizing about a sexual scenario involving Gifford, Regis Philbin, and producer Gilman.  A Mad Dog Russ impersonation was included.  The segment ended with further insults exchanged between Dice and Anthony, including a call from Dice from the street.

The final segment started with crude sexual banter involving Tina, a discussion about ratings using derogatory terms, and a caller, Mr. Sullivan, threatening legal action.  The hosts then made racially charged jokes about Khalid Muhammad's Million Youth March and Harlem.  A caller, Vanjie, challenged these stereotypes, prompting discussions about the hosts' anxieties regarding Harlem.  More racially insensitive remarks followed from the hosts and callers.  An 84-year-old woman, Fran, called in, telling off-color jokes and engaging in sexually suggestive banter, including discussions of her sex life.  She also played the piano.  A mock news report about a missing squirrel with morbid humor followed. The show concluded with a beer tasting of Steel Reserve and Howling Monkey, accompanied by further racially charged remarks.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talks at 1027.  And you're hanging with Opie and Anthony.  God, I told you, I told you, I scored it last night.  What do you mean?  Oh, well, I'm leaving the city and I'm driving here.  And roads are kind of wet, you know.  Except it was raining, Opie, it was raining.  Well, that happens from time to time, sure.  Yeah.  You know how slippery it can get? 
[00:00:30]  With the paint on the street, you know, like crosswalks and like the lines where you're supposed to stop and stuff.  All right, let me stop you.  What?  What did you...  Well, it wasn't harder.  Did someone beat up your car like they did?  No, no, no.  At that time?  Just, I need to paint one cab on my door.  I need to like, like a fighter pilot.  I got one open.  You took out a cab?  I got one.  Right on. 
[00:01:00]  I didn't take him out.  I just busted his taillight.  So what did he do?  Just up on the brake, the thing kind of went...  You know, my anti-lock brakes and stuff.  But I slid.  You're supposed to have anti-lock brakes.  And just tapped him.  Like no damage or anything to, especially to my vehicle, the cow catcher on the front.  Didn't even scratch the rubber.  But his taillight, you know, breaks.  He gets out.  My cab!  This is a 1998. 
[00:01:30]  Do you know what the taillight go for?  I'm like, no, but I guess you're going to tell me.  Right?  It's $500.  $500.  $500.  $500.  Come on.  Over a taillight.  Get out of here, Habib.  What are you talking about?  $500.  And he's talking like that's it.  I go, it's a lens on the front of that.  No, not lens.  He opens his trunk up.  Whole unit must be replaced.  And I swear, it wasn't even the entire lens.  It was like the lower part of it. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah, like the orange part.  Yeah, regardless.  Even if he had to replace the entire lens.  $500 for his lens.  The whole thing, trunk, and back seat must be replaced.  You make me lose fear.  $500, you pig.  So he's just ragging and stuff.  And I'm like, well, you know something, then?  Call the cop.  Call the cop.  Oh, I will call the cop.  Look, come with me to the auto parts store. 
[00:02:30]  They will show you that.  Now he wants me to follow him to the auto parts store.  Oh, yeah, that's good.  And go, all right, look.  I rear-ended the guy.  He's making a big to-do about it.  I said, okay, pal, look.  There's a cash machine right there.  I'll take $100 out of it.  A hundred bucks.  I give it to you for your effing car life.  Oh, it wasn't 98.  It was a brand new.  A hundred bucks.  Brand new.  I screwed up, man.  I slid into him.  What am I going to do?  He accepted the hundred bucks?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Now he's just going to go to the hardware store, get the red tape, and he's going to be set.  I just gave a guy a hundred bucks for nothing.  I could have done that, or I could have waited for a cop, report, go through insurance.  It'll end up being more than a hundred in the long run when the insurance company gets a hold of you.  You know what I mean?  A hundred bucks?  I know.  I didn't feel good about it myself.  And then he's yelling, like, before I even made him that offer, that, you know, $500, $500. 
[00:03:30]  And he goes, I will talk to another cabbie.  He will tell you.  Of course he will.  So, no, you know what happens?  He's screwed him.  Another cab pulls over.  The guy gets out.  He goes, how much you wear is for this taillight?  And the guy in the other cab is like, oh, that happened to me the other day.  It's like 90 bucks or something like that.  But you have a 97.  This is a 98.  He's screaming.  I was just like, God.  You should be able to punch him in the face for a hundred bucks.  I felt a little extorted. 
[00:04:00]  I felt like I was taken advantage of, like I screwed up because I actually paid him.  But it's like, what are you going to do, stand there and wait?  I had to make a decision.  I didn't want to let it go through the insurance company.  So I'm surprised you were polite enough to stop.  Usually you just keep going, Anthony.  There was really no good place to go.  Oh, I haven't gone.  What are you kidding?  You're the hit and run guy.  I'd never hit and run. 
[00:04:30]  And I'd never hit.  I don't hit people.  That was the first even encounter in New York City since we've been here.  And you see the way I drive.  Well, we had another one when I was driving.  That was you.  The famous guy knocking out my side view.  That cost me 250 bucks for a side view mirror.  Well, at least when I tap people, it's their car, Opie, not them in the crosswalk.  Well, the light was green.  I wanted to go.  It wasn't like I gassed it.  I just kind of inched up, hit the guy, hit him in the hip, figured he would move out of the way, and we'd be set. 
[00:05:00]  We'd be through the light.  He moved out of the way, all right, moved over to your side view mirror and punched it off your car.  One of the most amazing punches I've ever seen.  How much did that cost you to get it fixed?  I told you, 250 bucks.  See, that cost you 250 bucks.  Well, because you got the automatic mirrors and all that crap.  I got off cheap, 100 bucks for a taillight.  We've got to keep a tally.  That's 350 bucks we've had to shell out because of our driving habits.  It could have been a lot worse, the stuff we've pulled in the past year and a half.  Julio.  What's happened, dude? 
[00:05:30]  All right.  I'll tell you why he wanted the $500 for that taillight.  Yeah.  That's the cost of his deductible.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that makes sense.  I'll tell you one thing.  So many people are just so pissed at insurance companies, you don't want to go through them.  They're the ones that are getting money out of everybody, and you don't even want to go through them  because you're paying enough of your premiums already.  If you even have a little fender bender, your premiums go up.  It's worth it just to pay the people off.  Absolutely. 
[00:06:00]  $500 for a taillight.  For a taillight lynch.  Stacey, what's going on?  First of all, I'm not going to poke fun at you guys, but Habib is an Arabic name, and you're doing an Indian accent.  Do you think we know?  Do you think we care?  We've got a Chinese guy named Yoshi.  It's not called the OPA, Anthony, and Stacey show, so we'll do whatever the hell we want.  Stacey, what nationality are you?  I'm a Jew.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, no surprise.  The Jew's nitpicking.  Listen, we've got to do something. 
[00:06:30]  We're going to have to spin the ethnic wheel today.  I'm feeling in that mood today.  So am I.  You know what?  My husband is Arabic, so if you've got something to say, we've got to say it right now.  Habib married a Jew?  He's not Habib.  Yeah, Jew and an Arab are married.  That's pretty interesting.  How do you know that Kebby was an Indian?  Your particular Kebby?  Yeah.  How do you know I wasn't just doing an Indian guy?  Hello, give me $500.  You are, but you said Habib.  Yeah, and what's Habib?  Habib is an Arabic.  Maybe he was an Arab guy born in India, you bitch.  Oh, my God.  And not every person named Habib is in Arabic. 
[00:07:00]  And every Jew soothes.  If you just call me a bitch, I'm going to call my lawyer.  Really?  I like when people fight back.  Good job, Stacey.  Hey, Stacey, don't sue me.  I'll give you $100.  That's how much the cab driver tried to short from my husband and I.  This is it.  We were stalled out one day, and a cab driver actually was going to help us.  Yeah.  And the cab driver tried to jumpstart our Jeep to no success, however, tried to blame 
[00:07:30]  this jumpstart on the fact that their portable CD player stopped working as a result of the  jumpstart they tried to give us.  So she said, give us $100.  And so we told her the kids are, you know what?  You're Jew-ass.  Biggest ass.  You got it.  Yeah, something about the cabbies.  I mean, I don't see them as being the most ethical people when it comes to if you get  into a little fender bender, them not trying to get the better of the deal.  You know what I mean? 
[00:08:00]  I think they're very ethical.  When you tell them where to go, they take the direct route, right, Anthony?  Of course.  Yeah, you want to go to the village?  They know exactly how to go the shortest distance between two points, right?  Well, when you hop in.  They're not zigzagging all across town, are they?  I know when someone's coming from LaGuardia or something.  Hey, you brand new, I just come to America.  Want to take me to a park, Amaridia?  Oh, okay.  That's all we have to go through Jersey. 
[00:08:30]  Wherever you have to go.  How much money is this?  Oh, that's the lowest denomination, the one with Grant on it.  Oh, too funny.  All right, we're just getting started.  I'm seriously thinking about spinning the ethnic wheel today.  Ethnic wheel.  It's kind of a brand new feature on the O&A show.  Basically, we got a bunch of ethnic groups on this wheel, kind of like the Wheel of Fortune wheel.  We spin it, and whatever ethnic group it stops on, we spend an hour telling jokes about that ethnic group. 
[00:09:00]  What do you do?  One of my favorite bits from the Greaseman show.  What do you think?  I like it.  You like it?  Boy, I hope it lands on the black sea.  It's kind of like a car wreck on the highway.  You're going to have to see what the hell these idiots are doing next.  Opie and Anthony, we refuse to be responsible.  So don't screw yourself.  We refuse to be responsible.  One, two, three. 
[00:09:30]  We deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of worse.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  Yes!  And we've got to welcome Rick, our producer, back to the show.  He's back.  Rick, now a married man.  Yep.  Hold it up high.  Let me see.  Oh, hold it up.  There it is.  Wow.  Boy, that is a prominent drink, isn't it?  Jesus Christ. 
[00:10:00]  There ain't no mistake in that.  I've been tagged, so on a return to the wild, she knows exactly where I am.  I was going to say, that looks like a tagging.  This one's been tagged.  Look at him.  I saw that guy this weekend.  Did you?  The crocodile hunter?  God damn, does he make me laugh.  Isn't he funny?  He's really funny.  He, like, doesn't care what the hell he's doing.  I've seen him stick his head in a cave where there were snakes.  And the snakes started biting his face.  And he's just like, look at these gorgeous creatures.  They're gorgeous.  They're biting my face. 
[00:10:30]  This is gorgeous.  And he's got his wife with him.  Yeah.  She's some American broad.  And they're in the middle of a river.  And there's crocodiles in there.  And you see one go by, a big one.  He's like, all right, watch the boat, honey.  And he jumps in.  And he starts, like, grabbing the mouth.  And he's talking as he's doing it.  I'm going to try to roll him over before he goes into a death row.  A death row.  Because they did, like, a crock will grab onto us something and then roll. 
[00:11:00]  It'll just spin.  And tangle up its tail and everything in there so he can't get frayed.  And also, whatever it's grabbed onto, it's ripping a chunk out of it as the crock spins.  Sure.  You know, usually it's some poor dopey wildebeest that went into the river.  Not this dopey Australian guy who's trying to wrestle it on his home turf.  Yeah.  That's the alligator's home turf.  Oh, I'm calling him now.  Look at me.  Honey, okay, honey, now jump in.  And he gets his wife in there to sit on the crock's head. 
[00:11:30]  Sit on his head, honey.  I'm going to stick my thumb up his bum and see if he's male or female.  Well, this weekend, he was chasing crocodiles.  He was chasing them?  Yeah, there was some form of crocodile.  They moved pretty damn fast and stuff.  And he was chasing them.  They were about three, four feet long.  He could run like a mother.  And he's running all over the place and tackling these things.  He doesn't care.  No.  I've seen him with all kinds of animals.  And he gets bitten.  He had a kangaroo once.  And he was trying to wrestle that thing down. 
[00:12:00]  And the thing's just kicking the crap out of him.  Oh, he's gorgeous.  Look at the color on this.  It's just bleeding and everything.  Yeah.  Bob, what's going on?  You ever notice that he's always wearing those same khaki shorts and T-shirt?  That's all he owns.  That's that Australian outback kind of wear.  Right, right.  The guy jumps in the ocean, right?  He's going to rescue a shark from a net.  He's wearing the same khaki shorts and T-shirt.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't change.  No, he doesn't change. 
[00:12:30]  His wife's in the scuba tank with them.  And he's still wearing this.  You see him scuba diving underwater in the shirt.  In his crocodile Dundee outfit.  Right, right.  He's got the boots on over his slippers.  He's some kind of superhero, I think.  I don't know what the hell he is.  And then he's diving with those sharks.  And he sticks his hand in the hole in the coral and pulls it out.  And it's like totally bloody.  You see him on the boat.  Look, I got my hand.  He seems so it bit me.  Yeah, no crap.  Look at what you're doing.  You're taunting him.  The guy has no fear whatsoever.  Swimming with crocodiles. 
[00:13:00]  Going into mud holes.  He ducks underneath the water, underneath the rocks, and pulls out the little crocodile.  Where the hell did you get that thing from?  Look at him.  Isn't he gorgeous?  Yeah, and he's crawling along next to him, right?  Sticking his face in the thing's nose.  Oh, he bit me.  He bit my face.  I saw him.  He was holding a snake.  The thing laid right into his nose.  Oh, no.  Don't do this at home.  Don't do this.  Yeah, sure.  I was really just thinking of going out and doing that at home.  Trying to find a snake.  Thank you, Bob.  He was chasing some kind of animals with a Land Rover. 
[00:13:30]  And he's on the bumper trying to rope it.  And he missed.  So he just tells his wife to pull up next to it and jumped off the rover onto this thing's head.  It looked like he was being trampled.  Because he was.  I got him, honey.  I've got him.  Like hoof marks in his face.  Look, it's gorgeous.  You think he throws his wife around like that in the bedroom? 
[00:14:00]  Probably.  Look, I'm going to roll her.  She's going into a death row.  Now I'll stick my thumb up her bum.  I'm going to give her what we call the lycus.  Take a u-log over her head.  Jason, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I saw him making excuses for a poisonous snake once for trying to bite him.  Well, I'd be right angry, too, mate, if I was in New York.  And if you were in my house trying to get my babies.  And it's like coming like two inches from me. 
[00:14:30]  Snapping away.  And him and his wife are trying to catch these poisonous snakes in like South America.  And he's making excuses for them for trying to bite them.  That guy's such a tool that you've got to watch him.  You've got to love him.  I was laughing so hard.  Crocodile.  Between that and the Giants game, I had a lot of comedy this weekend.  It's beyond moronic.  It's sub-moronic.  Oh, yeah.  One-oh-two-seven.  Yeah, a lot of people want to know if Corky Steinbrenner would make a appearance today to congratulate Coney on his perfect game. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, there you are.  What's up?  It's Corky Steinbrenner, everyone.  Not the strong.  Boss from the 1970s.  All of a sudden, I'm a little wrinkled old man that's so sensitive.  I cry every two seconds.  Oh. 
[00:15:30]  Now, Corky Steinbrenner, I see you have your crazy Eddie outfit on.  Same outfit you've been wearing since 1977.  That's how I dress.  I wear my turtleneck.  My little sports jacket.  You were wearing that same outfit yesterday, even though it was 100 degrees.  You must have been sweating your baldies on.  I was wearing this with my fire.  Billy, where are you?

Yoda, Yogi, what's the difference?  So you must be proud of Cody.  Cody!  Pitching the perfect game.  Perfect game!  He's the best pitcher in baseball! 
[00:17:00]  He sure is.  And you had Don Larson there?  Don Larson!  What a man!  Let's not forget his perfect game from 1956.  1956!  Did you see the picture of me in the paper with...  Daryl!  Daryl!  Daryl!  He's the best crackhead in baseball!

[00:18:00]  Mattingly!  He's a good player!  Brody, Yankees, wasn't it?  I used to be so strong in the 70s!  I never shed a tear!  Remember me yelling at Reggie all the time?  Sure does!  Reggie, Reggie, Reggie!  I made you so... 
[00:18:30]  Look at me now, I'm a plumbering fool!  I used to be able to fire people up to right!  I didn't care!  I didn't care!  Do you remember what you said in the locker room after you guys won the World Series last year?  I don't know!  I was crying!  I said, the Yankees are the best team in baseball!  Oh, it's Dave Winfield!  I love it!

[00:19:30]  He went to Black Firm and Tate!  And Randy Rhoads!  He ran to my favorite guitar place!  Why?  Leave the flying to professionals!  You don't see me flying to you!  Don't forget Stevie Ray and the helicopter!  Jim Crow G!

[00:21:00]  It's a sing-along, too, so everybody feel free to join in!  I'm going to bounce some balls!  Look at those balls! 
[00:21:30]  There's no crime that you'll be committing  I know the law, you can kill a kitten  And if you need yarn for that scarf you're knitting 
[00:22:00]  You'll get plenty when you kill a kitten  Feed a turpentine  Or break its spine  Crush you with your shoes  As long as you  Can a kitten  If the one you love isn't quite as smitten 
[00:22:30]  Don't you like you better when you kill a kitten  And I'll quote the Bible  And I'll quote the Bible  Cause that's where it's written  If he loves Jesus  If he loves Jesus  He must kill a kitten  Throw him at a train  Make him snort cocaine 
[00:23:00]  Snort cocaine, drown him in a lake, bake a kitty cake, flush him down the can, hit him with your van, stick some TNT, up his cup of tea, do what you must do, as long as you kill a kitten, kill a kitten. 
[00:23:30]  Killing kittens isn't easy, and if the thought makes you feel queasy, grab a pitchfork from the shed, and kill a puppy dog instead. 
[00:24:00]  Kill a kitten, you got to kill a kitten, a little furry kitten, you got to kill a kitten, you got to kill a mother, you got to kill a son of a killer little, you better kill him in a...  To 8675309, to 8675309, yeah.  Steven Lynch, everyone. 
[00:24:30]  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony, on FM Talk, at 1027.  Oh, yes.  All right, I'm upstairs now, with the King.  All right, with the King?  Yep.  All right, he's in our lobby, we're going to try to figure out if he's worthy enough to come down and hang with us today, Anthony.  All right.  All right, here he is. 
[00:25:00]  Hello?  Hey, King.  Hello.  Hello.  How's it going?  King?  Yeah.  Is this the King?  Yeah.  You sound like the King.  I hear that voice.  Now we've got your CD Gravelance.  Do you like it?  Yeah, it's great.  It's quite different.  I guess the concept is, you're the King, singing other people's songs that are dead.  Yeah.  And we played Come As You Are in Sweet Home Alabama on our show already.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you. 
[00:25:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  I'm getting raved reviews by our listeners.  They like it, yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's great.  So why imitate the King?  Well, it's someone I have loved and admired since I was seven years old.  Do you know why we have you on the phone? 
[00:26:00]  No.  Why?  We're trying to decide if you're worthy or not to come down here and hang with us.  And so far, you're not winning the battle.  All right.  All right.  I'm serious.  So what else can you give us?  Okay.  We do several acoustic songs.  Yeah.  So you're going to...  And answer any questions that you want to have answered.  Well, there's not many questions we want to ask.  Yeah.  The Elvis impersonator.  Are you an Elvis impersonator? 
[00:26:30]  Do you dress up like Elvis and stuff?  Well, I wore a black leather costume.  Yeah.  Similar to the one that Elvis wore in the 60th TV special.  You sound very excited.  Well, I've been up for 4.30 this morning.  I'm exhausted.  Yeah.  We had so many plans delayed on us in Chicago.  And it's been a real long day.  We're setting up a special studio for you, okay?  Right.  So I'm worthy then?  Well, I don't know if you're worthy yet. 
[00:27:00]  I think you need some stack or two.  Well, here's our plan.  Right.  Here's our plan.  We want you to do at least one song from your Gravelands CD.  Yeah.  But we want you to perform it in the bathroom here at N.E.W.  Can you do that?  In the bathroom?  In the bathroom, on the potty.  We're setting up a microphone and everything.  Yeah, we'll have a mic in there for you.  On the potty?  Yeah.  Headphones and stuff.  Well, you don't have to take your pants down or anything.  You just got to sit on the toilet. 
[00:27:30]  No.  And play your song.  No, I don't want to do that.  I don't want to do that.  Why not?  Because I think it's sick.  Why is that sick?  Because it...  I heard there's good acoustics in the bathroom.  Because Elvis Presley died in the bathroom.  Well, yeah, that's the reason we want to do it.  Yeah, that'll give it more of a...  The ultimate tribute to the king himself.  What do you say?  We'll negotiate this point.  We'll...  They want me to sing from the bathroom.  We'll plug your CD. 
[00:28:00]  We'll allow you to play a couple songs.  Because Elvis died in the bathroom.  From the bathroom.  It's like the king on his throne.  I'm just saying...  They wanted to talk to me on the phone first to see was I maybe worthy enough to sign into the studio.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So what do you think?  I'm worthy enough to go to the studio, no problem.  But I don't want to sing from the bathroom.  Why not?  That'll be neat.  We have a mic in there and everything.  I'm not going to sit on the toilet and sing.  On the toilet and sing.  On the toilet and sing.  No. 
[00:28:30]  See, no.  It doesn't sound like you have much of a sense of humor about you.  Are you a funny guy?  A fun guy?  Or are you very serious?  Uh...  You're a pretty serious dude.  I would say, yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, having five children...  Dude, it's a...  It's a...  And a mortgage is pretty serious.  It's a goof CD, so we're going to goof around with you.  What can I tell you?  It's a goof CD.  A goof CD?  A goof.  Goof.  Not good.  It's kind of goofy.  Goof?  Goofy?  What do you think? 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  Like, it's kind of...  Don't you think it's a little weird?  Like...  I would think you would have this tremendous sense of humor.  It's a fun, warm-hearted CD.  Um...  It was okay.  I mean...  I thought the music was good.  I thought the impersonation needed a little work, but...  Well, that's your opinion.  Your intent is it.  So what do you say, King?  No.  We got the studio set up?  No.  It's a great...  It's a great room, acoustically?  Ah, no.  I don't want to sing from the bathroom, sitting on a toilet. 
[00:29:30]  Is that just because you would never sing from a bathroom?  It's out of respect for Elvis Presley.  Out of respect for Elvis?  I think Elvis would be into something like this.  No.  Come on, we wanted you to, you know, be naked in there.  We'll take that away, so you just have to sit on the toilet.  No, I don't want to sit on the toilet.  Why not?  Ah, I just explained why.  What if the lid was down?  Yeah, the lid will be down.  I don't care if the lid's down or up or...  You don't have to, like...  The cubicle doors open or closed or whatever. 
[00:30:00]  You don't have to take a dump when you hit the high notes or something, you know?  We're just looking for you to sit on the bowl.  We'll have a mic in there, headphones.  So that's how Elvis Presley died, is it?  I guess that's what they say.  That's what they say, but I don't think it was during his performance of a song.  Come on, you're an Elvis impersonator.  Yeah.  You do other people's dead songs.  Yeah.  So you should have a sense of humor and do this.  And then we'll plug the CD and everything.  Yeah, but it's not the derogatory humor. 
[00:30:30]  It's a...  Hey, King, you're making money off other dead artists' work.  Right.  I'm making money.  I haven't made any money.  You know?  You're singing...  I haven't made any money.  How do you know what money I have made?  You sing a Nirvana song, a Leonard Skinner song, a A.C. Ducey song, Jimi Hendrix.  Excuse me.  You are making money off other dead people's work by playing the records on your radio station.  Yeah, and we'll spin records from the bathroom, too.  Yeah.  James Cameron made the film Titanic.  So you want to start accusing him of making money off people dead. 
[00:31:00]  No.  We hit a soft spot, I believe.  We're not accusing you of anything.  All we're saying is...  We're just saying, if you're going to sing other people's songs that are dead,  that you should have a sense of humor to perform them on the toilet.  As Elvis.  No.  As Elvis.  No.  Elvis died on the toilet.  Get it?  No.  Are you, like, in love with Elvis?  I've explained that I don't want to...  No, are you like...  sing out of respect for the memory of Elvis.  Are you in love with Elvis?  Is that it?  Like, you have this love for him?  Yeah, a fraternal love.  Anything wrong with that? 
[00:31:30]  A fraternal love?  Anything wrong with the fraternal love?  Or have you found a way to make money off his name?  What?  Just to ask him.  Elvis seemed to have had a sense of humor.  Yeah, he had a wonderful sense of humor.  Great sense of humor.  Yeah, and that's kind of a weird sense of humor thing to perform one of the songs sitting  on the toilet.  No.  No?  Hey, King.  I've already told you about 20 times.  I thought we could talk you into it.  What?  I thought we could talk you into it.  Damn. 
[00:32:00]  No.  See, I guess you didn't really know much about our show then, huh?  No.  We have every artist that ever comes into Opie and Anthony's studio performs from the bathroom.  That's right.  No.  And it's just a coincidence that Elvis died on the toilet.  We didn't even take that into consideration, but it is kind of the way it's set up.  Well, all right, so your final answer is no?  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  I guess we could play your CD from here then.  Well, it's up to you. 
[00:32:30]  All right, would you like to hear me play?  I would like to go into the studio where you are and perform the songs.  Well, no, no, the deal is...  We can't do that.  The deal is you perform from the bathroom or that's it.  No.  Well, then I'll play your CD here in the studio.  Why can't you let me go into the studio and perform the songs like that?  Because it's much more fun if you do it in the bathroom.  Yeah.  No.  No?  You sound intense, man.  What?  You sound like you're going to cry or something. 
[00:33:00]  You all right?  Yeah, I'm fine.  You sound intense.  All right.  Do you ever lighten up or loosen up or laugh or something?  Sometimes.  Yeah.  Not now.  A sense of humor, huh?  It doesn't sound like...  All right.  Well, would you like to listen as I play your CD here in the studio?  Yeah.  Go ahead.  All right.  Here we go.  Did you hear that? 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  All right.  All right, King.  There's pieces of CD all over the studio.  Well, do you think you're the one who has to clean it up?  Yeah, that's all right, though.  It was worth it. 
[00:34:00]  All right, man.  Have a great weekend.  I will.  All right.  See ya.  Bye-bye.  Oh, my God.  I don't think that step was necessary, Opie.  What?  I understand he wasn't gonna sing from the bathroom, but...  Now, Rick's gotta go deal with this. 
[00:34:30]  Why is everyone leaving me?  I don't know.  I think you were a little harsh.  Nah, he was being rude to us, too, man.  All right, we gotta take a break.  I thought he was gonna sing from the bathroom.  I swear to God, I thought we were gonna get him to sing from the bathroom.  Well, that would've been fun, right?  Yeah.  What was the big deal?  He seemed to not want to undo it because of Elvis.  Elvis died on the toilet.  All right.  So, out of his love for Elvis. 
[00:35:00]  What happened?  I thought we were just having fun.  Dudes with Tunes.  Well, I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  Opie and Anthony.  No!  We're out of control!  We're so angry!  All right.  Knock it off.  1027.  Now, more of the work.  Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 027.  The talk you can't ignore. 
[00:35:30]  Good afternoon, *** library.  Hi.  I was wondering if you could help me.  We'll try.  Okay.  My son came home with a list of books that he needs to read for his fourth grade class.  Okay.  Well, why don't I switch you to the children's and she can see if she can help you with one  you might need.  Oh, thanks a lot.  Sure.  Hold on, please.  Children's Department, Karen speaking.  Hi, Karen.  I need to come into the library and pick up a few books for my son.  Okay.  He's one with a reading list from his fourth grade class. 
[00:36:00]  Uh-huh.  Do you have Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach?  Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach.  Doesn't sound familiar.  Doesn't mean we don't have it.  Is there any way you can look that up?  Yeah.  Okay.  Do you have others that you're looking for?  Yeah, I guess there's a whole Harry Beaver collection.  Okay.  Now, he doesn't sound familiar, but that's not 100% certain.  I guess he's a new author out of Seattle.  Okay.  He writes children's books.  Okay.  It's Harry Beaver Goes to the Beach. 
[00:36:30]  Uh-huh.  Harry Beaver on the Dike.  The Dike.  Okay.  Harry Beaver Gets Wood.  Gets Wood.  And finally, Harry Beaver and the One-Eyed Wonder Worm.  Okay.  Why don't you hold on just a second and I'll check the computer to see if we've got any of the  these.  Okay?  All right.  Thanks a lot.  Sure.  Harry Beaver collection.  Shh.  Gotta come back.  Shh.  Thank you for waiting. 
[00:37:00]  I checked our computer here and we don't own any of them and I also wanted to see if  anybody in the region has any of them and nobody's coming up with any of the Harry Beaver  books.  And I also looked in our children's books in print for 1997 and I didn't come up with  any Harry Beaver in there either.  That's awfully strange.  If it's really new, it may just be that nobody has it yet.  So no one has Harry Beaver yet? 
[00:37:30]  No.  It doesn't look that way.  Harry Beaver doesn't come up on the computer.  No.  All right.  Do you have any of the Bobby series?  Bobby.  Now, I'm not familiar with Bobby either.  No.  There's one book on this list.  It's Bobby Goes...  Can you read his writing?  Bobby...  Bobby Goes Muff Diving?  Hmm.  Do you have an author for these at all?  An author?  Yeah.  Let me see here.  Uh...  Oh.  Anita Bushliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker. 
[00:38:00]  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  He's a fishliker.  Don't even try to figure it out.  Just go along with it.  Whatever.  1027.  All right.  It is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick, the producer of the show.  Sitting in for the guys.  They'll be back on Monday.  In the meantime, it's a worst of for today.  Quick couple tunes.  We'll do a bit in between both these songs.  And be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  FM Talk.  1027. 
[00:38:30]  WNEW.  Allison Chan.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  Hi, boys and girls.  And welcome to another edition of Stoner Spelling Bee.  Today's contestant is Old Dirty.  Old Dirty?  Your word is inebriated.  Inubriated.  Yeah, let's hear this one.  E-N-U-B-R-I-T-E-T.  Am I good?  Inebriated.  Inubriated.  R-A-T-E-T.  Yeah.  Inebriated. 
[00:39:00]  Inubriated.  Yeah.  E-N-B-R-E-A-T-E-T.  E-N-B-R-E-A-T-E-T.  Yes.  I was right, yeah.  Okay, Old Dirty.  Since you're from the hood, use inebriated in a sentence, and then try and spell it.  All right, use inebriated in a sentence.  Right.  Every time I go to the studio, I get inubriated.  Okay, now spell.  E-N-U-E-N-U-E-N-U-B-R-E-A-T-E-T. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah, man.  You gotta be it, man.  Inebriated.  Inubriated.  B-R-E-A-T-E-T.  That's it, man.  I don't know it, man.  Anyway, I know what it feels like.  I don't know how to spell it.  And that's my word.  Inebriated.  It's I-N-E-B-R-I-A-T-E-T-E-T.  It doesn't sound like inebriated when you spell it.  See you next time, and thanks for playing.  Opie and Anthony at 1027. 
[00:40:00]  You deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  Anthony, the post has a great story on your favorite TV host.  Who would that be?  Star Jones from The View.  Ah, yes.  I love Star.  She's a diva, you know, Opie.  Whether you think she is or not, she says it.  Is it?  So I guess it's true.  Diva. 
[00:40:30]  Anyway, the headline reads,  Cranky View of Star Jones Bash.  Right?  This is unbelievable.  Star Jones was nice enough to invite 60 friends to a barbecue  at her summer place in the Hamptons,  but not all her guests were so nice.  One in-grade called up MSNBC  to complain that guests weren't allowed in the house  to use the bathroom, Anthony.  Instead, they were relegated to rented portable toilets on the lawn.  And she wouldn't let the guests in her house to use the toilet? 
[00:41:00]  No.  She didn't want guests using her bathroom.  Well, I got a reason for that, honey.  See, my ass is so big, I got a custom-built toilet bowl.  It's as big as a jacuzzi.  And I was fearful they would fall in with their skinny, narrow asses.  I'm a diva.  Oh, you're a diva, right.  Also, there were complaints from people that were at this party  about the menu that Star Jones selected. 
[00:41:30]  The menu?  What could be wrong with the menu?  Well, Star Jones provided hamburgers and hot dogs for a guest.  Very nice for a barbecue, right?  Uh-huh.  But she reserved the lobster for herself,  prepared by her personal chef,  which she washed down with some champagne.  Washed down?  You can just picture eating the shell and everything.  What a witch! 
[00:42:00]  What a witch!  Oh, it gets better.  So she sits there.  She sits there.  She's eating lobster and champagne.  Right, and she's giving her guests...  Well, everyone else has weenies.  And burgers and hot dogs.  Burgers and weenies.  Yeah.  And she gets the champagne.  I don't think she had champagne for everyone, Anthony.  No, probably.  Just mix up some Kool-Aid for them ingrates.  Get the great Kool-Aid. 
[00:42:30]  And then at one point, she told the chef to make sure that no one else got her lobster.  Oh, that that was for her and not the guests, said a spy.  That's for me, diva.  It's star stock.  Get in the portable toilets.  You mud people.  I'm a diva.  I use the bathroom.  In the house.  Star stock?  Yeah.  Star stock.  Star stock.  I don't know no limp biscuit, but I got buttered biscuits in there. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, my.  Keep your hands off them.  I'm hungry.  Why do I sound like River now?  I love the red hot chili peppers.  Yeah.  Not the band.  I'm just eating red hot chili peppers.  Yeah, it's star stock.  Pass the corn.  Take a hand off if it even got close to her lobster and champagne. 
[00:43:30]  I'm a diva.  And who would want to use that toilet?  Imagine going into Star's bathroom because you know the first image you would get is of her on that bowl.  With her big old air.  Big air.  It's hard for me to line up.  It's like aim.  I got to use one of them, uh, one of those northern bomb sites like they use on the bomber planes just to line up so I don't hit the seat. 
[00:44:00]  There's a lot of ass over here.  I'm a lawyer.  Here we go.  Let me line up.  Here we go.  Stay out the bathroom.  Star, I have to use the bathroom.  Use the tree out back. 
[00:44:30]  This is Star's bathroom.  I'm a diva.  There's another one.  That was a whole claw from my lobster.  That hurt coming out.  That's lobster tail.  Look, it's hanging out.  Look, I look like a lobster.  Look at that. 
[00:45:00]  Star, I really need the bathroom.  Use the pool.  Woo!  Damn, that's a tasty crustacean.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  This one's working out pretty good.  Stay out the bathroom. 
[00:45:30]  I'm in here.  I'm a diva.  Fart equals funny, kids.  Opie and Anthony.  Yes, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck. 
[00:46:00]  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen.  1027.  And speaking of Woodstock, we got on the line a guy that was at Woodstock.  You're hearing the stories with the bonfires and stuff.  Yeah.  Oh, and we've heard the stories of people getting hurt.  Rumors have it that some people got killed at Woodstock.  And, well, here's a guy.  It's an exclusive for the Opie and Anthony show that was at Woodstock, and he got hurt.  Sir, are you on the line?  Hello.  There he is.  What's going on?  I'm all sunburned.  You're sunburned. 
[00:46:30]  Oh, can I hurt?  My ass was kicked.  Oh.  What do you mean your ass was kicked?  I was at Woodstock, and I was very injured.  Yeah?  Very injured.  Well, what happened to you?  Well, right when I got there, I wanted to be one of the mud people.  Because it looked like so much fun in 94.  Yeah.  So I found some mud by the Porter Johns.  Uh-huh.  It was feces.  I was covered in feces.  Didn't you know when you were spreading the stuff all over your body? 
[00:47:00]  Well, I thought it smelled, but I figured it was that hippie chick next to me.  But it was crap.  Oh.  And then I felt like I would be free and naked.  Yeah.  So I took my pants off, and the girls laughed at me.  Because I went to the body painting.  Uh-huh.  And I had my penis painted.  But they thought it was a big joke.  They painted a shrimp on it.  So I had to walk around Woodstock with a shrimp dangling from me, and everyone laughed at me and beat me mercilessly. 
[00:47:30]  And you had feces all over your body as well.  I don't forget that.  Yeah, okay.  So I was very injured.  Would Joe see the little fidget from Kid Rock?  Yeah, the little fidget from Kid Rock?  What about him?  He head-butted me in my sack bag.  And I got a rupture.  So I'm suing that whole band.  You're suing Kid Rock.  Well, they got a lot of money.  Oh, and then I was in the portable toilet doing business, and some roping group of hooligans tipped it over on me on the door, and I couldn't get out. 
[00:48:00]  I was trapped for 12 hours.  I had to breathe through a toilet paper tube.  Well, they were trying to snorkel in a pool of urine and feces.  Well, they were trying to make more mud.  What can I tell you?  That wasn't on my brochure.  I got with my tickets that I'd be with urine and feces for 12 hours. 
[00:48:30]  Oh, and then I finally get out, and I went to see Metallica.  Yeah.  And I put a nude curl up on my shoulders, and I got crabs on the back of my neck.  And then I tried to get her off, and she was stuck there.  So I have a big hickey now on the back of my neck.  Oh, the crabs biting you as we speak?  Oh, I itch.  I have to shave my head, and now they've migrated south. 
[00:49:00]  So I have full-fledged crabs.  So you got a painted penis.  Oh, like a shrimp.  Like a shrimp.  You've got feces all over your body, and you've got crabs that you had to remove most  of your hair at that point.  Right.  Okay.  Oh, and she was stuck on my neck like a sucker fish.  You ever see those?  Yes, I have.  In your aquarium?  Yes, I have.  Oh, try removing that.  Hey, did you get hit by any of the tampons that were flying during the Red Hot Chili Peppers  set?  Oh, Anthony Kiedis, yell to the women.  Yeah.  If you're on your period, throw your tampons on stage. 
[00:49:30]  Yes.  Oh, I picked the wrong time to turn around and yawn, because I was turning toward the  crowd to yawn.  Because you were tired.  Oh, and I think it was Fat Dottie that threw it.  Then someone set me on fire.  They set you on fire?  Yes, more roving bands of hooligans with their candles, and my glasses were on fire, and  my shoes.  Well, the candles were for a good thing. 
[00:50:00]  What the hell were they for?  Burning place down is what they were for.  Yeah, pretty much.  So now I'm burnt, covered in feces with the crabs, and I got tampon in my mouth.  It's a taste that even Listerine doesn't make sense.  I hope they didn't dump out of that.  Who knows?  You never know when they're dumping out of our show these days.  That old gag.  That old gag, right.  Okay, then.  Well, it sounds like you had a successful Woodstock experience. 
[00:50:30]  Oh, I'll remember it forever.  All right.  Very good.  Well, thank you, sir, for calling us.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There he goes.  One of the many people that got injured at Woodstock.  You guys in conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  All right.  Spaz trying to defend his manhood once again today after receiving a picture of Spaz in  a bra, Spaz having a real tough time explaining this one. 
[00:51:00]  With all the evidence that has accumulated over the months that you have been here at  N.E.W. on the Opie and Anthony Show.  What evidence?  We've run for about a million times.  Two girls in the closet, didn't complete on either one.  That dirty dance you do.  So the girls that don't call you back.  Your lack of knowledge of women's anatomy.  I can't even go on.  And that's right off the top of my head.  And now a picture of you in a bra.  Now, yeah, a picture of you in a bra turns up where you're not fighting. 
[00:51:30]  Your arms are up in the air.  You look like you're like, I'm free and gay.  I got my bra.  I'm not gay and I plan to prove that.  It looks like you're trying to raise the roof to a Ricky Martin song while you have a bra.  Come on.  Yeah, look.  I mean, remember that I was forced into that situation.  I did not do that voluntarily and alcohol in my system.  They forced it on me.  Hello.  I'm going to start it. 
[00:52:00]  Why are you dressed?  Spaz is wearing a bra.  Why do we have a picture of you wearing a bra?  I can explain this.  I can explain this.  This is the same guy that found it fun to see me squirm.  Yeah.  Now, this that wasn't months ago or weeks ago.  This was last night.  Remember, I was forced into that situation.  I did not do that voluntarily and alcohol in my system.  They forced it on me.  I don't understand.  I am not gay and I plan to prove that. 
[00:52:30]  I can't understand why I don't get chicks, man.  I, come on.  I'm not.  I don't wear bras.  Just putting all the evidence together.  That's all.  Just another piece of a puzzle.  We have evidence.  We have evidence now of you wearing a bra.  Just another piece of a puzzle.  Girls can't get Spaz off in the closet.  Now we got pictures of him wearing bras.  You figure it out.  I won a bra last night and they forced me, they forced it on me.  I, come on.  I was struggling. 
[00:53:00]  I don't know.  All of a sudden, I won a raffle, so I'm on my knees and like, you know, this guy and his  stuff and put on my game, but I couldn't fight him off.  You know, I couldn't fight him off.  He's big and strong.  Yeah, I would have fought any person trying to do that to me.  So I'm in front of the glory hall, right?  Right.  But like it was my turn because I won the chance to be there.  I couldn't leave.  It's like a bunch of guys are holding the door shut. 
[00:53:30]  Excuse me, but I don't want to toot my own horn, all right?  You know he's an actor, right?  Yeah, he does these theater things.  Every so often he comes in and tells us he's got a little early for a person and stuff like  that, sure.  What the next place Spaz is in is unique.  Why would that be?  What is this like?  Oh, I don't know the name of this, but he plays a, he plays a guinea guy.  I don't know why.  Wait a minute.  I don't know why.  Wait a minute.  Spaz?  Yes.  You're playing a gay guy in the play you're in? 
[00:54:00]  All this, like, I'm not sure if I'm gay or hetero in the play.  This guy comes on to me.  Is he going to do a taste for it?  Taste for it.  Yeah, you're going to taste something else.  You're going to taste ass.  Dude, that's real life, man.  What?  It's not.  Dude, this isn't a play.  It's an act, but there's no theater, no theater group, no actors, no actors.  Look at the evidence piling up against Spaz.  Thank you, Spaz.  Now you're kissing man. 
[00:54:30]  I'm not going to kiss me.  Where is the line drawn?  I'm not going to kiss.  OJ looks innocent right now.  I know, right?  I'm innocent, I tell you.  Come on.  I wish, come on.

And she goes, her girlfriend and her husband, she went down to like party lounge and got  fake boobs.  And they went out on the Long Island Expressway and she's flashing people. 
[00:56:30]  She's in her 70s.  Oh, my God.  Oh, rub them off on the road surface, hanging out the window.  Definitely a hazard.  That damn Viagra's to blame.  Like a dog.  Oh, like a beagle.  Ears flapping in the breeze.  Hey, whip them out, shiny.  Look at him.  Oh, like a beagle.  Blood out. 
[00:57:00]  Whip them out.  Take them out from behind your ears, Grandma.  That's how you get a look.  Your blue hair is blocking the view.  Two flat tires.  Ouch.  Damn, I'm going to pull up to an Exxon and pump some air into those.  Have sparky pressure check that.  32 pounds per square. 
[00:57:30]  Wow.  That's been funny.  That's something.  Well, we should be left to other people.  Yeah, we should leave.  Not 70-year-old grandmas.  I think we should leave on that.  A nice up note.  Oh, yeah.  A nice little laugh there.  All right.  This is going to go downhill from there.  Too late.  We should go.

[00:59:30]  Wild  And with the wild, wild stage  With the ring from Anthony  N.E.W.  It is Opie and Anthony  Hello, how are you guys?  Thanks for joining us  Last day before vacation  Yeah  Yeah  Who are you kidding?  We've been on vacation for the last  Two months  Hell yeah  Well, it's FM Talk  1027  For now  Talk you can't ignore

Yeah, we're basically on vacation  I mean, who are we kidding?  Yeah  We're not going to lie to you  We didn't even try to put on a show today  No  But I guarantee we'll have another good one  We'll have some fun, I think  As happens around the Opie and Anthony show 
[01:00:30]  But the day before you go on vacation  Yeah  It just doesn't matter  The boss could yell at you  I don't care  Vacation  He could get a bad phone call  I don't care  Something goes wrong at work  Who cares?  On vacation  On vacation  It doesn't matter  You know?  Absolutery  We were just too paranoid to take yesterday and today off  Everyone else did  Yeah  I think we're the only live radio hosts in all of New York  Everyone else took their little  Two-week vacation  And we were too paranoid to do that  Nah, we're like  We don't feel loved enough to do that 
[01:01:00]  We're like  Yeah, we take Monday and Tuesday off  Everyone's going to forget about us  Yeah, but we get a phone call  Right  Um, guys  Look, it's going really well without you  Why don't you just take some more time  No, it's good  We've got the Slappy and Wappy show  Replacing you  Yeah, that's true  What else are we going to do?  We like just coming in here anyway  Well, the fact is  Our lives aren't that interesting when we're not here  So  Yeah  This is our lives  What are we going to do?  What are we going to do?  Like, yeah, you know  Go to Hammerstein  And check out Fat Boy Slim 
[01:01:30]  With young 20-year-old chicks  Look what I'm banging, Robin  This is fantastic  What a great story in the paper  Where is that?  Yeah, that is a killer, killer story, man  Are we allowed to talk about Howard?  Or is the company going to get pissed at us  And say we're not team players?  The company will get pissed at us  And say we're not team players  But it's a news story, man  And goddamn, it's a good news story  Howard's in the news  Look at you, honey  Let me see those cans  This is hilarious 
[01:02:00]  That's right, Robin  Suddenly single Howard Stern  Seems to be jumping back in the saddle  With both cheeks  That's right, Robin  Stern, who was legally separated  From wife Allison last month  Showed up at the Hammerstein Ballroom Friday  With his eldest daughters  To check out the DJ stylings  Of Fat Boy Slim  The shock jock was just sort of  Moving to the music  In a private balcony box  While his kids  Look at me boogie, Robin  While his kids rage full on  But after about an hour  Stern put his girls in a cab  And returned to a party in earnest  Get home, I gotta bang 
[01:02:30]  The king of all media  Quickly called two women on his cell phone  Had their names added  Had their names added to a guest list  And danced with both at the same time  Stern soon focused his full attention  On one of the lucky ladies  A twenty-something  Yeah, Howard  I'm finally respecting the guy  Goddamn  A twenty-something  With shoulder-length brown hair  And a booming body  While the other girl  Mingled with the VIP crowd  Our spies, excuse me  Say Stern was bumping and grinding 
[01:03:00]  With the mystery cutie  Until a friend resurfaced  At about 12.30 a.m.  The three then left together  That's right, Robin  Not long after that  Two other revelers  Had to be tossed  From the private box  For engaging in a sex act  I took two chicks home with me  Baba and Bowie  God bless him, man  Look at him  It's about time he breaks out  And has some fun, right?  Now he's out  Like, wasn't that just something  That he always just said  He never did?  Yeah  Like, went out? 
[01:03:30]  Yeah  Now, what did he do?  He took these two chicks  Went to his  We don't know where  Swank apartment?  Did he do that?  We have no idea  We could just assume  I guess  Or imagine  But the funny thing is  Stern in town here  Lives in the same building  As Regis  Yeah  Some luxury high-rise there  Howard, keep it down  For God's sake  He's banging all night, gentlemen  I can't get any sleep 
[01:04:00]  I gotta do  Who wants to be a millionaire?  And Howard Stern  Is banging next door  Howard, for the love of God  It's four in the morning  Gelman, shut him up  I can't believe  He's banging so long  Howard, where'd you find these whores?  They're all nighters  Howard, I gotta sleep  I gotta put up with Kathy Lee 
[01:04:30]  And you're banging  Shut up over there  Two broads  Two broads, yes  Is that Kathy Lee in there?  Howard  Who are you banging?  My God  That's something  He's getting something  God bless him  Where's Joy?  I hope Joy didn't go next door  To borrow a cup of sugar 
[01:05:00]  Howard, you're not banging my wife Joy  What's going on in there?  Gelman, they're banging  Gelman, what are you doing here?  Do fat!  Hey, Scott, what's going on?  What's up, gentlemen?  Hey, man  I was there  I saw him for a few  But in the beginning  He looked a little like  Afraid of everybody  Yeah?  Oh, yeah?  I think he must think  He's something bigger than he is  In his head or something  I don't like going out in public, Robin  You know how that is 
[01:05:30]  But I saw a couple of girls  Every girl was talking to him  Anyone could have wrote  Like a million chicks for Dan  Well, of course  Every girl wants to be the first broad  To bang Howard  You know, since their separation  The funny part is  When guys are there with their girlfriend  And they find the excuse  To slip away  To go talk to Howard  And there's like nine guys alone  And they came with their girlfriend  I invented dancing  You know  I started moving my feet  All of a sudden  Everyone started moving  And call it a dancing, Robin  Well  Can you believe it?  Ripping me off  Well, what do people do  Before dancing, though? 
[01:06:00]  Just stood there  Just stood there  Yeah, music played  And they just stood there  I invented dancing  Shut up, Jackie  Hey, Sal, what's up?  I was at that Fat Boy Slim concert  Yeah, how was Fat Boy Slim?  First of all  Because I missed the show  He was great, man  He ripped me off  You know, that guy  Fat Boy Slim ripped you off, Howard?  That's right  I used to  I was doing the DJ thing  Yeah  And he ripped me off  He ripped you off  Absolutely  I invented Fat Boy  I got a Fat Boy in my pants 
[01:06:30]  Right, Robin?  Now, more of the worst  Of Opie and Anthony  On FM Talk  At 1027  The talk you can't ignore  Bob Seger  Good song  But it brings back  Some nightmares  From past weddings  When that one comes on  At a wedding  Yeah  You can't even get up  To go to the bathroom  Oh 
[01:07:00]  Because if you walk  Near the dance floor  The drunken aunt grabs  Come on!  Sit like that  All the drunken  Dancing  You look like a jerk  In the video  And it's always  The older aunt  That still thinks  She's really hip  She wants to show everyone  That she's hip  And cool  So she dances  To Bob Seger  Because she thinks  That's today's music  I like the new music  Right  How about this one  I am going to strap myself to the seat at every wedding I go to. 
[01:07:30]  Because no matter what, I've got to sit there and beg.  While my arm is getting pulled up, dance.  I'm not dancing.  My chair is getting dragged.  They don't understand.  I don't dance.  I wind up cursing at relatives.  I'm not going to dance.  It makes your aunts go crazy, though.  You could be at the table with your friends and stuff,  talking about what has gone on into your life.  Yeah, man, I got this really cool job at N.E.W. now and stuff.  Yeah, it's working out really cool.  Most of the listeners hate us, but every day we're getting some new listeners. 
[01:08:00]  And I think we could make a go at it.  All of a sudden, in the background.  Oh, my God, Anthony, come on.  This is my favorite job of fans.  Next thing you know, your normal conversation is wrecked.  You're dancing.  You don't even want to dance.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, oh, I want to do the kick line to New York, New York  with a bunch of my drunken friends again.  Can't I just rent the video from ten weddings ago and play it back? 
[01:08:30]  Can you just dub that part in from whatever's wedding?  Come on, Anthony, why aren't you doing the Congo line?  Oh, yeah.  Come on, yeah, let's all do the Congo line.  Oh, let's walk around the tables and pick a get away from me.  Let's get really wacky and walk the Congo line into the kitchen.  Oh, that's zany.  Oh, look at Grandma.  She's 104 and she's on the Congo line.  Look how cute.  Doesn't she look beautiful? 
[01:09:00]  Look, you look beautiful.  No, you know what she looks?  She looks old.  It looks like an old lady in a prom dress.  It's the only place you see that is at a wedding.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, but that's just the way it is.  Grandma doesn't look beautiful in the dress.  She looks old in the dress.  Back in the kitchen, back in the house coat,  where we know how Grandma's supposed to look.  Oh, that...  I'm not doing the chicken dance. 
[01:09:30]  I'm not doing the Congo line.  I'm not doing New York, New York.  I'm sitting here, get me another Bacardi and Coke,  and leave me alone.  Okay?  Thank you.  Uh, you know what I get at every wedding for my relatives?  Hey, Hope, you're a DJ.  Why don't you get up there and show them how it's done?  Hey, that's funny.  Hey, coincidentally enough,  why don't you get in the back and flip some burgers?  Why do you think I haven't called you in five years? 
[01:10:00]  Because you're an a-hole.  You still are.  No one noticed you went to the bathroom 20 times,  and you must have eaten a powdered donut.  Right, there can't possibly be cocaine around your nose.  Yeah, it's 1998.  You're still asking me if I want to do a toot.  Get away from me.  Want to do a toot?  What are you?  What are you, 15?  Get out of here.  You realize that stuff will kill you?  What a dope.  Most weddings, I'd look around the room and I'd go, 
[01:10:30]  you know, if I wasn't related to these people,  I don't think I'd ever hang out with them.  Oh, the ants, they're fighting over who gets the centerpiece.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, that's a great addition to any house.  That's what I need.  Flowers in a gaudy pot with candy in it.  Oh, I need that.  Okay.  The Opie and Ethan Show.  I have no clue what anybody's saying,  but it's the funniest damn show.  More stupidity on the way.  1-0-2-7. 
[01:11:00]  Everything Robin's saying.  And, you know, I got to admit, back when he first came out,  what was it, mid-late 70s?  Mork and Mindy.  Mork and Mindy.  When he was on Happy Days and he fought Fonzie.  Oh, boy, what an episode that was.  That was great.  Where Fonzie couldn't move because Mork froze him or something.  But Fonzie's powers came back.  Right.  Ridiculous.  Didn't his, like, pinkies start moving at first when they were in the middle of the fight?  He froze him.  But then, yeah, his pinkies started moving again. 
[01:11:30]  But the power of A.  The power of A.  He came back to life.  Yeah, his thumb.  His thumb.  His thumb came up, yeah.  His A thumb.  What an A-hole.  God, I can't watch, but maybe the first season of Happy Days,  when it wasn't filmed in front of an audience,  so you didn't have the,  when everybody walked in.  When there was Chuck?  Yeah.  Chuck was still there.  When he just disappeared and no one asked any questions?  There was no chachis, no this one, no, 
[01:12:00]  it was just the guys and they would do things that was 50s oriented.  Yeah.  After a while, what's leather Tuscadero and the suede dancing?  What is that?  They all had the dry look from Gillette.  Right.  The 70s do's.  It's the 50s.  And then all of a sudden you get to see Jenny Piccolo  and you realize that she's a pig.  The pig, Jenny Piccolo.  All those years I was dreaming,  thinking Jenny Piccolo is Joni's really hot lesbian friend,  and then she finally shows up and is like, 
[01:12:30]  ah!  Ridiculous.  The Fonz with his thumb.  But we were talking about Robin Williams.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So that's when Robin Williams was funny is what you're saying.  No, that's when I got roped in, too.  You'd see him do a stand-up act, maybe, or see him on talk shows,  and he's going off on every little prop.  He picks something up.  Hey, look, look, it's a doorknob.  Look, and you turn it into a...  And everyone's rolling.  Ah!  Robin!  Oh, did you see him with the doorknob, babe?  And I'm laughing, and then finally I'm like...  What the hell am I laughing at? 
[01:13:00]  He's not saying anything.  Yeah, next time you see Robin Williams on a talk show,  really take a close listen to hear what he's saying.  Oh, it's nothing.  He picks up a coffee cup.  Well, thank you.  I'll drink this.  I'm drinking coffee.  And my son, he drinks, too.  He comes up to me and says,  Daddy, I've got to come.  Oh, and it's so funny.  And the audience is rolling, laughing.  I want to smack him.  He's not saying anything.  He's not saying anything funny. 
[01:13:30]  I was in Manhattan the other day in New York, crossing the street.  I walked across the street.  Man, day, day, day.  All right, and you cross the street.  Big sign, side of road.  Walk, don't walk.  What?  What do I do?  I don't know.  Should I walk?  Well, what is...  Yeah, what?  What?  What are you saying?  What are you trying to say?  I'm a father now.  My young son comes up to me and says,  Dada!  Dada! 
[01:14:00]  Hey, my kid does that, too, and that ain't funny, right?  Robin's improvising again.  He's brilliant.  Oh, he's improvising.  There he goes.  He's off stream of consciousness.  Oh, look at me.  Look, look, I'm standing.  Now I'm sitting.  I'm standing again.  Wait a minute.  What's he doing?  He gets on Letterman and he has to run all over the stage.  Let me run.  I'm going to run.  I'm going to go up to the back.  Hey, hey, look, Dave.  I'm up here.  I'm up here now.  This is hysterical.  Funny stuff.  Well, what are you doing? 
[01:14:30]  And I got roped in years ago.  I would sit there in a room full of people laughing.  Go, oh, this guy is great.  He's not saying anything.  Richard Pryor, you get the MRFers and stuff, and it was funny.  Yeah.  Eddie Murphy, hysterical.  Right.  And then Robin.  Oh, look.  You ever see a dirty window?  You spray Windex and wipe it.  It's clean again.  Yeah, that's washing windows.  And everyone's laughing. 
[01:15:00]  It's talking about washing windows.  And he still does the same thing.  And people in the audience, oh, they're laughing their asses off.  Right.  At Robin.  The other thing about Robin Williams, doesn't he do, like, the beard when he's doing the serious roles?  Yes, you will notice.  Robin Williams in the serious role will always have a beard.  In the comedy roles, he shaves.  That's what I do.  So I up to work. 
[01:15:30]  I shave, and I'm funny.  Look at me.  Look, I'm shaving.  Get back.  Look, I shave.  Now, I have a beard.  I'm a serious actor.  Look, now I'm shaving.  So funny.  You're making fun of it.  You're making fun of it.  I know.  Not funny.  All right.  I'm sick.  Where are we?  Where are we in this mess of a radio show? 
[01:16:00]  I'll up.  All right.  Can you tell we're excited to be back from our long vacation?  We're on vacation.  But then we came back.  We were away.  Now we're here again.  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  Ah!  What is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going to change  the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony. 
[01:16:30]  Boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this show, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony.  We've just received a PhD in stupidity.  102.7.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talks at 102.7.  Mom, are these people cannibals?  Now, now, Chelsea.  Why would you say that?  Because the chief said he'd give anything to eat me. 
[01:17:00]  Hmm.  He sounds a lot like your father.  Your mother, Hillary, is very respected here.  She has the one quality that is most coveted in our village.  What's that?  Wisdom?  Compassion?  No, a fat white ass.  Oh, well.  Your African name, Chelsea, is Kiala Abelafu.  That's beautiful.  What does it mean?  Lanky pale girl with face of a wombat.  Oh.  Hey, Mom, Man Pingo wants me to go into the forest with him. 
[01:17:30]  I think he's going to let me have one of his pets.  Why do you think that, Chelsea?  Because he said he's going to give me his 12-inch you pangy black snake.  Oh, it's beautiful out here, Man Pingo.  By the way, what does your name mean?  It means man with three legs.  But you only have two legs.  Oh, really?  Wow!  Kelsey, when we are through tonight, the whole village will call you Iwachalakanaya. 
[01:18:00]  Wee!  What does it mean?  That means she who cannot sit for weeks.  Oh!  Now grab your ankles, Kelsey, and I will demonstrate what your father does to your countrymen.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Put it away, put it away!  One must know your ego before he can condemn it.  Boopie.  One must have seen evil before he can banal you.  Anthony, this is disgusting. 
[01:18:30]  That's very, very cruel.  Help!  And and not.  Oh, Mandingo, it's so big.  I need two hands to hold it.  Ah, that's it, Chelsea.  Now wrap your lips around it.  Like this?  Yes, that's it.  Now blow, Chelsea, blow.  Nothing's coming out.  Oh, be patient.  Chelsea, and blow harder.  Oh!  Bullseye! 
[01:19:00]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Wow, thanks for showing me how to use your blow gun, Mandingo.  Anytime, Chelsea.  We best go back to the village and find your mother.  I wonder where she is.  Maybe she's in this hut.  Oh.  Mom, what are you doing with Mandingo's sister?  Oh, dear.  You said you were going on a safari.  No, no.  I said before the day ends, I want to be deep in the bush.  Well, you do what you want.  I'm going to help Mandingo take care of a bad animal. 
[01:19:30]  What are you talking about, Chelsea?  He wants me to spank his monkey.  Well, just be back in time for dinner.  Okay.  Well, what are we having?  I don't know about you, but I'll be having the African beaver.  All righty.  What's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer for the Opie and Anthony show.  A lot of requests for that.  Hillary and Chelsea on safari.  Got a whole lot of bits. 
[01:20:00]  They keep coming in, and we keep taking your requests.  So if you've got any good ideas, stuff that we haven't played yet,  because we're trying to squeeze in as many different things as possible.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Also getting some great ideas off the instant feedback, so keep those coming.  In the meantime, we'll take a quick music break.  All right.  And remember, in between each and every tune, we will be doing Worst of Bits.  Simple as that.  Let's keep it going now.  It's the Worst of Opie and Anthony with Judas Priest. 
[01:20:30]  FM Talk, 1-0-2-7-N-E-W.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's the Worst of Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, it's the Worst of Opie and Anthony show.  More stupidity on the way.  1-2-7-N-E-W.  I am Darth Walgum.  Defy me and get a boot up your ass. 
[01:21:00]  I'm a princess slave.  Not my helmet.  Martin Deku.  Shut up, you overgrown mudblood.  I am Darth Walgum.  Luke, I am your father.  Your mother was the worst I ever had.  If she gave good help, you wouldn't even be here.  When she dropped her pants, it looked like she had a Wookie in a leg lock.  Lando Ferrisi.  We meet again.  Shouldn't you be sitting in the back of the ship, you f***? 
[01:21:30]  And you, Jabba the Hodge, you f*** bastard.  You can't even see your d*** anymore, can you?  I am Darth Walgum.  Yoda, make like a gerbil and crawl upon Solo's ass.  You look like a scrotum with ears.  My balls are as big as the Death Star.  Obi-Wan, you limp d*** of f***.  You can't even get it up anymore.  Cuck.  I am Darth Walgum.  Motherf***er of the universe. 
[01:22:00]  It's beyond moronic.  I am fine, fine.  It's sub-moronic.  Obi-Wan.  1027.  We deserve the best.  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Obi and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  It's Obi and Anthony.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Kick it!  That's Coal Chamber, by the way. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  Very cool band.  Rocks.  That rocks.  You know, I wanted to take a musical break here.  Yeah.  Just not digging the music we have picked out today.  Grab something else.  We just did a really bad job picking out the music today.  Grab something else, then.  I thought some of this stuff would be cool today.  It's just...  Play something off the new Barry Williams CD. 
[01:23:00]  You want to do that?  Have you heard any of that?  No.  Oh, it's frightening.  Barry Williams, the return of Johnny Bravo, Anthony.  Imagine what a bitch it is being this guy, Barry Williams.  You're Greg Brady, and that's all you will ever be known as, no matter what you try to do.  Like, he tried to get a singing career off the ground, and that petered out.  And now he's trying again?  Johnny's back.  Johnny...  The return of Johnny Bravo. 
[01:23:30]  So now he's even milking a character he played as Greg Brady.  Oof.  Adios, Johnny Bravo.  Remember that episode?  Yes.  He left the family?  Yeah.  They just wanted to sign Johnny Bravo.  Well, because...  Greg Brady.  Because the suit fit.  Right.  And he told everybody, sorry, he's got to go solo.  Mm-hmm.  But then it ended.  They were all cool and got the band back together, Opie, and sang It's a Sunshine Day.  You know, we turned down Barry Williams for our radio show.  Maybe we should have him on so we could play the Joe Pesci game. 
[01:24:00]  Or we could play tracks from the new CD and then ask him if he expects to sell any of  these things.  It's still one of my favorite things we've done.  Johnny's back.  You want to hear some Barry Williams, Greg Brady as Johnny Bravo, Anthony?  Is that what you're saying?  Hold on to your hat.  Yeah.  Listen to this.  Groovy.  Groovy.  Johnny's back. 
[01:24:30]  Johnny's back.  Ready to ride your mountain ride.  Johnny's back.  Ready to dance till the morning light.  All right.  Joy jump every move.  Now Johnny's to the ship for the room.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's getting ready to dance. 
[01:25:00]  Johnny's back.  Ready to dance and walk the feet.  Johnny's back.  Yeah.  Get ready to dance and move the beat.  Too many years have come and gone.  This is great.  This is a goof, right?  I think he's serious.  Johnny's back.  Johnny's back.  Ready to rise his town to ride.  Run.  Run. 
[01:25:30]  Get ready to rise his town to ride.  Yeah.  Johnny's back.  Get a little cold, Johnny.  Johnny's back.  Get a little cold, Johnny.  All right.  Listen, I can't hear any more than that one.  Is there any other tracks on there worth trying out?  Happy Together.  Oh, my God.  Happy Together.  Hey, Greg.  It's 1999.  Almost 2000. 
[01:26:00]  He's on the cover of Ziti wearing his Johnny Bravo vest.  With his triple chin.  You know, it's just time to, like, fade into the real world, Barry.  I can see clearly now that the rain is gone.  Gone.  I can see all obstacles in my way.  Hey, Tom, what's up? 
[01:26:30]  Are you trying to kill me?  Come on.  I'm dying here.  It's Johnny Bravo.  Let's go.  Come on, man.  Oh, my God.  I'm crying over here.  Please stop it.  End of madness.  This rules.  I think this is going to be album of the year, to tell you the truth.  All right.  Have a good day, O'Neal.  All right, man.  Hey, our listeners are loving this.  Bill, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  Turn this off or I slit my wrist, man.  Come on.  We've got to hear this one smash, man. 
[01:27:00]  Come on.  Rip it out and smash it.  It's going to make you puke.  Oh, God.  All right, Bill.  Please stop.  They're loving it, Anthony.  It's very obvious here.  He covers a Huey Lewis song.  Oh, what track is that?  Let's see.  Hey, Luke.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  This is unbelievable, man.  I'm loving this thing.  You guys get so much props for playing this song.  It's hysterical.  Don't you love it?  Greg Brady.  I want this album.  I want this album.  The Return of Johnny Bravo. 
[01:27:30]  Does the record company really and truly believe that they're going to sell copies of this thing?  Man, I have a compilation that's called The World's Worst Records.  Yeah.  And, like, I picked it up just as a goof.  It's like, I want to re-release my own version, man.  This one's going to be the first song on it.  Well, Johnny's back.  And let it roll.  Yeah.  Here's the Huey Lewis remake by Greg Brady as Johnny Bravo.  Off his latest CD, everybody. 
[01:28:00]  Talk it up.  Crank it up.  This is going to be a hit.  Used to be a renegade.  Renegade.  Used to fool around.  Yeah.  With Alice.  I couldn't take a punishment.  Had to settle down.  Now I'm playing at B-square.  And, yes, I cut my hair.  Fell out.  Crazy.  But I don't even care.  But I don't know what's going on. 
[01:28:30]  It's hit to be square.  Yeah.  Hit to be square.  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  I almost go off the damn road, man.  Why?  You've got to stop this.  This is top-shelf stuff, man.  Yeah, where can I get it?  You obviously don't know music like Anthony and I.  I apparently don't.  Yeah, well, I'm pegging this as album of the year.  Without a doubt.  Hey, I'll send you the copy for Christmas.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Used to be a renegade.  Yeah, that must have been the episode where it was caught smoking. 
[01:29:00]  Johnny's back.  And running to rock.  It's hip to be square.  It's hip to be square.  There he is.  I would rather hear Corky sing.  You got any other tracks off of that, man?  Yeah.  And what is this one again?  I wasn't listening.  We are the champions.  We are the champions.  Ah, cool.  This has got to be good.  A little tribute to Freddie Mercury.  Rich, real fast.  What's going on?  Guys, I will do anything and you please don't play another song.  Come on. 
[01:29:30]  Come on.  I just watched some guy in a car slit his girlfriend's throat and wrote,  No More Johnny Bravo with her blood on the passenger side window.  That was Greg Brady.  Come on.  We're tracking through the new Johnny Bravo CD.  I think it's very important for Anthony and I to be up on our music.  So, yeah.  You spin another tune.  You'll be able to listen to me drive my car into this bridge.  Oh, really?  Let's try that.  All right.  I'm not kidding.  Ah.  Here it comes, Rich.  Thank you.  Vocal silence.  I've made my dues, time after time. 
[01:30:00]  Yes.  I've done my sentence, but committed no crime.  And bad mistakes.  There he goes.  I've made a few.  Making Frank and Arnheim proud.  That my chair of sand is in my place when I come true. 
[01:30:30]  Bring it home, Greg.  We are the champions  No time for news, cause we are the champions  Of the world 
[01:31:00]  Ronnie, what's going on?  Yo, dude, you're killing me  You guys are killing me here  I've already sliced my ribs  Don't let me bleed out  Come on, it's Johnny Bravo  It's Johnny Bravo, let's go  Don't let me bleed out to Johnny Bravo  I'm going  Johnny's back  All right, thank you  It's a sunshine day

[01:37:30]  Who the hell is ever going to buy this damn freaking CD, man?  Wacky DJs?  We didn't buy it.  It was sent to us.  I know.  Gino, you're next on FM Talk.  What's going on?  You guys are killing me, man.  It's like kryptonite.  I don't even have the strength to go to the radio and shut it off.  Listen, I've got to hear Joe Pesci on the phone because I missed it.  I need Joe Pesci after this.  All right.  The time Joe Pesci called to promote his CD that was out last year.  Yeah.  Yeah, he was putting out a CD of like Italian songs and stuff. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah, yeah.  From My Cousin.  There was like a My Cousin Vinny rap or something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And we had him on the phone.  A lot of people thought it was Anthony doing Pesci, but I swear to God it was actually Pesci.  Why no Joe Pesci from Arthur Avenue?  And we made fun of him.  And why don't you file away the Johnny Bravo because I'm sure there's hours of listening pleasure there.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Give it to me over here.  All right.  Johnny Bravo.  Yeah, this is a good one.  I believe we could do at least two or three more hours of radio on Johnny Bravo. 
[01:38:30]  I want to keep this because I think after playing it, just once like that, the requests are just going to come flying in for it.  Sure, sure.  You know, so I'll put it somewhere safe.  Yeah, put it right next to the Stephen Lynch CD.  You know.  Oh, look.  You ever see a Johnny Bravo CD come apart like that?  A little platoon reference.  I see that.  Thank you.  Yeah, this is Joe Pesci from a year ago calling our show to promote a CD.  Check it out. 
[01:39:00]  Is this Joe?  Yes, this is Joe.  Joe.  Who am I talking to?  Hopi or Anthony?  Both of us.  Well, you guys talk from the same neck.  Pretty much there.  Connected like Siamese twins.  So, Mr. Pesci, I got your CD in front of me.  How do you like it?  It looks great anyway.  It looks good.  I saw the commercials for it this morning.  I'm laying in bed.  I see commercials for this thing.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  What is Joe Pesci doing?  What's this all about?  Well, I just, you know, Tommy Mottola and I from Sony decided, we talked a long time ago about doing this. 
[01:39:30]  We thought it might be fun to hear a guy from the neighborhood sing all different types of songs.  You know?  So, I did it as Cousin Vinny and did it with a Brooklyn accent so we could have some fun with it.  And we did little parodies on some songs that people know, you know.  What, did you guys shake down some drug dealers for this cast and put this together?  I don't know.  Doing Mottola?  I don't know what to think of this, to be honest with you.  Well, you have to play it and listen to it.  What do you mean you don't know?  All right.  All right.  We could do that.  What song do you suggest we play? 
[01:40:00]  Well, I think your Cousin Vinny would be good.  Excuse Opie, Joe.  No, he's not a, you know, Cousin.  No.  Uh-oh.  He might not understand.  You'd be shoving me in the back of a car, I think.  Well, you can play Wise Guy, too, the rap thing, if you like it.  If we like the...  Joe Pesci rapping?  That's it.  I wrote a thing called Wise Guy.  Can you do a little rap for us on the phone?  No, I couldn't.  You don't know how hard that is.  Those guys are really good.  I didn't know how hard that was.  Yeah, a little white Italian guy can't rap like a black guy. 
[01:40:30]  No, I did it as a white guy.  All right, wait.  I've got to hear Joe Pesci rapping.  This is Wise Guy off Joe Pesci's new CD.  Check it out.  It's a bitch's out of kitchen.  It's a bitch's out of kitchen.  It's a bitch's out of kitchen.  Hey, hey.  Paint out my ass.  Treat all the laws like trash.  You'll catch a blast if you move too fast. 
[01:41:00]  I talk to class.  You don't have to ask.  Getting everything by flash and cash.  Whiten and steel.  You'll kill without steel.  You saw it winning casinos before you started doing.  All about respect and intellect.  Only mess with the women that pick up the check.  The model, you want to need charm.  One chick's in net.  The other was blonde.  I heard that fathers had spots and moms.  So I fucked them up and left them floating in a pond.  Customated clothes on the head to toe.  So do you expect to sell any of these things?  What do you mean do I expect to sell any of them? 
[01:41:30]  Do you think I'm going to still pay for my house with them?  I'm going to style my bathroom because of the little plastic squares.  He's going to whack you, Opie.  Listen, you're going to like it.  You're going to have some fun with it.  Well, yeah.  Can I use it for a beer coaster, maybe?  I don't know.  I think you should try to play it first.  Okay.  He's getting mad.  I'm trying to get you mad.  I want to hear the passion that we all know and love.  He's going to curse.  Do you have your bleeper in your hand?  Yeah, I do.  Go for it.  No, I don't want to do that.  Come on. 
[01:42:00]  I'm the fastest bleeper in the world, actually.  Get the f*** out of here.  I hit it.  I hit it in time.  I hope so.  Come on.  Challenge me.  Go ahead.  That's it.  Come on.  I'll give you another plug for the CD.  No, that's it.  You play it.  That'll be enough of a plug.  Hey, thanks.  I appreciate it, guys.  Thanks, Joe.  Thank you.  Take it easy.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Hey, Ann, your mom did say I was hot.  Oh, come on, Mom.  Don't bang, Opie.  You f*** my mom. 
[01:42:30]  I'll f*** yours.  I say lay back and enjoy it.  It's a hell of a tobacco, right?  Opie, you're dead.  A couple of your mother.  One, Opie, seven.  Opie, you're a sick-ass man.  Anthony.  You're not a jackass.  You're obviously a star.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It makes me sick.  1027.  All righty.  Quick programming note.  I forgot to mention a whole lot earlier. 
[01:43:00]  Yesterday, I mentioned that we'd be doing when Andrew Dice Clay was in studio.  Coming up in the 5 o'clock hour.  Okay?  That's your warning.  So if you want to make sure you check it out, if you caught any part of it, heard about  it but never heard it, or anything, if you just want to check it out once again because  it's so freaking hilarious.  And I'm adding a section to it.  I found another section from Dice vs. Dice.  So when the real Dice Man confronts Anthony coming up in the 5 o'clock hour, in the meantime,  we've got some other great stuff.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:43:30]  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  The Talk You Can't Ignore.  It's written from the perspective of a priest that I knew many years ago when I was going  through some troubled times.  I went to him for some advice and love advice and I'm sure he helped me out a great deal.  You're not a person anymore.  Great.  Jesus.  Oh, man. 
[01:44:00]  Not bad.  Deep in prayer, my cross to bear, I kneel upon the floor.  Temptations of a Catholic priest aren't easy to ignore.  But I cannot control myself.  It rips my soul apart.  For one small sheep among my flock has stolen a shepherd's heart. 
[01:44:30]  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  At Sunday Mass or Bible class, I catch him in my view.  So I close my eyes, but there he lies, spread eagled on the pew. 
[01:45:00]  And when I see him in that frock, my conscience goes awry.  Altar boy, altar boy, is it going to be heaven or hell?  You can play my organ all night long, if you promise never to tell. 
[01:45:30]  Tell me, oh, oh, oh.  Our Father, who has not been one, hallowed be thy name.  I could dress him up like the Pope and then I, oh, dear God, the shame.  No, no, lead us not into temptation.  Deliver us from sin. 
[01:46:00]  We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ and I was Mary Magdalene.  Altar boy, altar boy, confess your sins to me.  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Oh, altar boy, altar boy, oh, altar boy, confess your sins to me. 
[01:46:30]  You will find the grace of God inside my rectory.  Torny.  Torny. 
[01:47:00]  Torny.  Do questions.  Torny.  Parny.  The Opie and Anthony show have been removed from the airwaves.  Well, that was...  I shouldn't have offended too many people.  I didn't swear. 
[01:47:30]  Opie and Anthony.  We punish ignorance.  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027.  All right, my girlfriend going on?  Yes.  Sandy.  Hey, Sandy.  Hi.  You're on the air there.  Are you going to hang me out to dry?  No, but please, come on.  Come on.  Do you agree with Anthony?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's just, you know, pick stuff. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  All right, well, first...  You're a stallion at home.  What are you talking about?  Thank you.  Thank you.  Am I a Minuteman, Seth?  No.  Yes, I am not.  I think you're practicing that tantric stuff.  That's thing practices.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  I've got a stallion.  Really?  Yeah.  What's his name?  Oh, wow.  Sam, you remember when we first started having sex, though, right? 
[01:48:30]  Yeah.  After our first date?  Yeah.  No.  Why is your brother ready to punch me?  Because.  Oh.  Remember, though?  It was like it was a lot quicker.  Yes, but that was...  Well, that's the point I'm trying to make today.  When you first start going out with someone new, that, you know, it's hypersensitive and,  you know, you don't last as long.  All right.  Yeah, you got a point there.  I don't know what Ann was getting at at all today.  I was getting at giving Chris, a caller, some advice.  Right. 
[01:49:00]  That you learned during the years on how to...  That's true, yeah.  As you get older.  You know, it was two different pieces of advice given by Opie and I, and all of a sudden  it turned into this whole thing.  I don't know.  Sam's the minute woman.  I am not.  Tell Rick to close his ears, because I am not.  Well, what's wrong with being a minute woman if you were?  Because I'm not.  That means you can't, you know...  What?  You can't hold out.  You can't hold out.  No, you're really good. 
[01:49:30]  Shut up.  Why?  Because I know he's listening, on top of everyone else who listens to your show.  What, your brother Rick, who's sitting afoot from me?  Yeah, look.  He's got his legs rolled up.  With the big arms.  Yeah, Rick, steroid boy, get over there, man.  He's like standing over me, making sure I don't say anything bad to you.  All I was saying with the whole finishing up quickly so you can recover for the next time  and then proving yourself thing is it takes the oral factor out of the mix right after that. 
[01:50:00]  And that kind of...  Yeah, because what guy's going to want to submerge if that's the case?  So you've got to work around that.  Yeah.  Sid?  Yeah.  I apologize.  I haven't done that lately.  I cannot believe you're...  I apologize.  Well.  Rick is right there.  You don't enjoy that?  Oh.  No, I do.  I don't know what...  I just haven't lately.  We don't need to discuss this. 
[01:50:30]  What's wrong?  We don't need to discuss it.  What's the matter, Elpy?  What?  No, there's nothing wrong with saying it to you, girl.  I just...  I don't know.  Why aren't you doing that, Elpy?  I just haven't...  Oh, man.  I just haven't...  What's the matter?  She gave me a homer last Friday, though.  Oh, gee.  Ah, look at Rick.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Emergency.  Oh, no.  Get out of the way.  Are you crazy?  That's okay.  It probably only lasted a minute for Ove, so...  Eh. 
[01:51:00]  I'm saying...  We can't discuss this.  Wait.  Well, you better discuss what he just said, because it wasn't...  Say it.  It was like two minutes.  No.  I'm not going to say what I want to say.  Oh, say it.  What do you want to say?  You're going to hang out to dry.  Did I last a minute?  No.  You live as longer.  A little longer?  Yeah, but I was almost getting, like, lockjaw.  Why did you almost get lockjaw?  What's the problem, man? 
[01:51:30]  Nothing.  Too big?  No.  Like, no?  She says no real quick.  Why did you almost get lockjaw?  I'm just kidding.  Oh, all right.  It's just a joke.  All right.  She was flossing her teeth.  Oh.  Lockjaw.  Sweets, I promise I'll, you know...  All right.  We don't need to discuss that.  Well, I know you like it and stuff, so...  How did...  Ow.  What?  He's not getting that mad.  He's turning red.  Well, I mean, I don't want him to get a visual.  Oh, you've got to do that. 
[01:52:00]  What are you doing?  I have, right, Sam?  Sam?  Not lately, I know.  You know, you're telling the listeners, the Tuesday Night Hummer Club, guys were asking  you to reciprocate, and then...  What?  You know, you're not going below the covers there?  What?  No, no.  How long, Sweets, a month?  A while.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, B.  Come on, man.  What?  That's fair, because I don't always do that either.  Right.  So it works out.  Sam, how's my technique, though?  Which technique are we talking about?  My oral technique. 
[01:52:30]  Why do you have to get back on that?  Because I'm really curious.  No, it's wonderful.  Oh, it is good?  Yeah.  It's not like I'm, like, you know...  It's not that convincing.  I don't know.  Like Sam Kinison said, it's not like I'm just painting a fence?  No, you're not painting a fence.  All right.  Sam, thanks for clearing it up.  I'm not a minute man.  No, you're a stallion.  I'm a stallion.  My oral technique is pretty good?  Yes.  Oh, his oral technique is pretty good.  Just ask any guy.  Sam, it seems like you finally are starting to enjoy the doggy a little bit. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, man.  Look, Rick's right here.  Well, let's just see.  Dude, what?  Oh, Rick.  Because when he said that, instantly everyone gets a visual, including Rick.  You don't need that.  See, now that's going too far.  That's worse.  The reach around was a hit.  Oh.  I hate it.  We have a problem.  I'm dogging your sister.  Get over it.  Oh, God damn. 
[01:53:30]  What's the problem?  That is not right.  That is just not right.  How could that possibly be a problem?  You can't put it like that, man.  No, dude.  You can't do that.  Some tact.  We've been there for six years.  It's about time you found out that I'm undoing her.  I don't think I need to hear about the certain positions that you're into.  Well.  You got any videos, man? 
[01:54:00]  Shut up, Chuck.  You ass.  Oh.  Chuck has made it into the studio.  Hi, Chuck.  Yo, what's up?  Hey, man.  I just came back for a beer.  All right, I'll let you off the hook.  There's a lot more I want to say, but I think I've said enough.  I don't know if you're letting me off the hook.  Like what?  Well, doggie.  Even he's doing it that way.  Use it or lose it.  Thank you, buddy. 
[01:54:30]  All right, Greg, what's up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Do me a favor, Anthony.  From one game to another, take over the show.  Rick, take this boy backstage, smack him.  How dare you?  What?  Smack the blonde out of this boy's head.  Talk about this man's sister like that on the radio.  Wait a minute.  You're not even married?  Rick, as one man to another from the gym, please, smack that guy out of his head.  That's pretty bad, huh?  I'm seething.  Anthony, from one guinea to another.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  How dare you let this man talk like that about this gentleman's sister?  What?  Well, you know something?  It's none of my business.  Get your hand on that button ready.  I've been going out with it for six and a half years.  I don't give a gut.  I think at this point Rick can handle the fact that I'm dogging his sister.  My brother Laura is married ten years to my sister.  He talks like that.  He ain't going home with feet.  I mean, not the, not the, Rick, smack him.  Spaz was supposed to punch me yesterday.  Now you want Rick to punch me?  Why?  Punch you?  My friend, you're talking about this man's sister like she's some kind of pig. 
[01:55:30]  And, Sandy, you're listening.  Shame on you for calling.  Shame on you.  Come on.  Sandy knows that.  Anthony, you're Italian.  You understand?  Yeah, I had a stand-up comic dogging my sister.  All right.  All right.  Please.  Rick, smack him.  All right.  Thank you.  Go, Yankees.  All right.  You guys are the best, and you're sucking.  But, Rick, you swallow if you don't hit him.  All right, guys, I'll tell you again.  I can't let that be.  No.  Oh, well, he's going to get up.  He said I swallow if I don't hit him. 
[01:56:00]  I got to hit him.  You got to hit him?  I got to hit him.  Wait.  If he said jump off the Brooklyn Bridge, would you?  No, because that's stupid.  Rick, you really do have reason to hit him.  You should hit him.  No, he doesn't.  You should hit him.  Hit him.  I have every good reason.  Hit him, man.  No, Spaz had every reason to hit me yesterday.  Rick, hit him.  You have no reason.  Dude, I've got a great reason.  Dude, you know how I treat you.  You know how close they are as a family and stuff?  They're very protective of each other.  And you say you're dogging her, doggie style.  Shut up.  And you're hummers.  Shut up. 
[01:56:30]  Rick, Rick.  I mean, shut up.  Shut up.  You know, the truth is, though, Rick, if he wasn't married, it would be one thing.  Chuck, shut up.  You see how big his arms are?  Shut up.  Dude, you don't lift weights.  Shut up.  Shut up.  It's true.  Yeah.  Shut up.  You've got to test run those arm muscles, man.  He's steroid boy.  Shut up.  God bless you, steroid boy.  I'm telling you.  I am not steroid boy, for Christ's sake.  The steroids mess with the brain.  Yeah, okay.  You have man boobs.  You've got man breasts. 
[01:57:00]  Sorry I don't spend eight hours a day at the gym.  Go get yourself a bro.  A man's here.  What?  A bra?  It's called a bro.  It's a Seinfeld reference.  Right.  Seinfeld reference.  It's the bro, Jerry.  It's the bro.  Now you've gone too far, man.  You've gone too far.  The bro, get away from me.  Sit down.  I said every right yesterday. 
[01:57:30]  You're right.  I think I want to punch him.  Hit him.  Where would you hit him, Rick?  Joey, shut up.  See, I don't know if I can hit him in the man boobs, because my hand might get swallowed up.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Joey, just remember who does your live reads.  You think Ann can remember all that info?  Ann.  We just know everything.  Wait a minute.  I know everything about Paisano.  Screw you, jackass.  I know everything about Paisano.  Why are you hanging me out to dry?  Look how big he is, man.  Come on, that brave.  Everything about Paisanos, Joey.  Who's down there more, me or Opie? 
[01:58:00]  I've got to say Anthony's.  That's right.  All right.  Come on.  I know who you like better.  That's all right, Joey.  He is taking me to the game tonight.  All right.  Yeah.  Come on.  We've got to stick together.  Go with to find the Polish guys.  Come on, get Rick out of this.  I feel like I've got to hit him now.  All right.  I'm not.  Rick looks like a caged tiger right now, man.  He's like stalking you, man.  You know what it is?  He's in conflict right now in his head.  He knows he should get up.  Shut up, man.  That's what he said.  Rick, Rick, Rick.  But there's some kind of conflict because he does genuinely like Opie and doesn't want  to hurt him.  But there is quite the reason. 
[01:58:30]  What if I call him?  He looks like he could snap you like a twig.  Yeah.  What if you say something bad to my sister?  What am I going to say about your sister?  I'm not banging her.  I'll call her up.  I can take care of that.  Can you bang her?  Yeah.  Can I bang your sister?  Let him bang your sister.  She's six months pregnant.  If that gets you off, you sick-aff, then go for it.  Yeah.  He's the sick-aff.  Wait.  I thought you liked that.  Yeah.  You're the one that liked that guy.  You were the preggers, man.  Wait.  Hey, Rick.  Let me ask you, though.  Chuck. 
[01:59:00]  No.  This one I don't know.  Like Spaz, if you were to hit Opie, you're going to be a  would he have the power to fire you?  Because, like, him telling Spaz to hit me.  Wait, wait.  Him telling Spaz to hit me was like,  I know you cheated on me.  Just tell me.  It'll be okay.  Go ahead.  Technically, I have the power of veto on anything I could decide.  And vice versa.  Listen, I don't want it to come down to a firing thing.  That's just beyond.  Then let him talk to you one.  No.  Let him just tag you one.  Rick, sit down.  Jesus.  Sit down. 
[01:59:30]  Let him just tag you one, man.  That'll be kind of cool.  That's one shot.  You guys will still be friends.  Be like brothers tonight.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just one shot.  Look how big his freaking arms are.  You know, brothers used to wrestle around.  Maybe I can give you a wedgie.  How does that sound?  How about I give you a wedgie?  That's a little homo.  That's a whole thing.  You're homo doggy style, dude.  Ed, shut up.  Instead, he did your sister doggy style.  Oh, man.  That's going to be...  Rick, sit down.  Hey, Ed, shut up.  I got to say, hey, Rick.  Lockjaw statement.  Hey, Rick. 
[02:00:00]  The reach around.  Shut up.  The reach around.  I forgot about that one.  The reach around.  Wow, what a guy giving her the reach around.  The reach around was working.  If I recall correctly, the reach around was working pretty good.  Banging her.  If you're going to...  Isn't the word banging?  Hold on.  Wait.  Not making...  Oh, my God.  Oh, Rick.  Oh, my God.  You see, Rick just threw the chair.  Oh, Rick.  This is getting bad.  This is getting ugly.  I am in the corner.  Spaz.  Spaz, hold on a second. 
[02:00:30]  Hold on.  I do have one thing to say.  Doggy style.  Hold on a second.  I got something to say.  Just remember.  Put the bottle down.  First of all.  Oh, my God.  Dude, you freaking hung me out to dry.  What did I do?  I'm just repeating what you said to the man.  Rick's about to break that bottle.  It's going to look like a black exploitation film in here in a minute.  What did I say?  You forgot to remind him that Sandy did say that I was good at oral.  Oh, Rick shot open. 
[02:01:00]  Rick has got him down.  There is no contest here.  There's no contest here.  Rick's got him totally.  Rick's trying to get away.  There's no way Opie can get away.  No way.  He's got him around the neck.  Oh, he's got him.  Opie's trying to get Rick's arm from around his neck, but it is not working.  Rick is totally dominating this brawl on the floor.  Opie cannot get away.  He's got one hand.  He's trying to hit Rick on the back of the head.  Opie just punched Rick in the side of the face.  Rick is sticking.  Rick is sticking his crotch in Opie's face. 
[02:01:30]  He's tipping him.  Oh, he's like laughing at that wrist, and he's flipping him over.  Opie having a hard time recovering from Rick, because Rick is on top the whole time.  Oh, my gosh.  Wait, Rick's pulling Opie's pants up.  Opie now getting really pissed.  He's totally ready.  He's got Rick in a headlock.  He's dragging him back on the ground.  He's pissed.  Two points for the reverse.  Two points for the reverse.  Opie can't seem to get Rick down, though. 
[02:02:00]  Rick like a bulldog.  Yeah, it's very hard to get Rick down.  Opie working, but I think he's tiring at this point.  Rick's endurance is going to start taking over now.  Rick obviously dominating this brawl.  Opie getting a couple of good shots in, but Rick sticking his crotch in Opie's face.  I think the most degrading thing I've ever seen.  He looked like Opie's head was a marshmallow for a second.  And Rick is up.  Opie's still down.  Hey, Rick.  Hey, how do you feel? 
[02:02:30]  Somebody call a medic, man.  They've got endurance and stuff.  Somebody call a medic.  Somebody call a medic.  Opie, Opie.  I must say, Opie almost gave me a rusty trombone.  How you doing, Opie?  How you doing?  How you doing?  How you doing?  Oh, putting up a valiant effort, but he's hard to take down, huh?  Yeah.  He's like a little fire hydrant.  A bulldog. 
[02:03:00]  Dude, watch that one song comes to mind.  Come, come, come, come, come.  Yeah, that's an appropriate song.  Should have been playing it while you two were on the floor.  Opie, what did you think when Rick put his crotch right over your face?  I was just thinking that, uh...  Gee, his ass smells terrific.  Wait, what was the question again?  What were you thinking when Rick stuck his crotch right in your face?  I was about to... 
[02:03:30]  Oh, no.  I had to do it, man.  No, don't say it.  I know what you were going to say.  I know what you were going to say, too.  How much are like your sister?  Oh!  Sorry, I had to do it, man.  I had to do it.  Hey, Rick's going over.  He's going to kick your ass.  Yeah.  Going for the black.  You know, his arms are big, but I have never bet on the white guy, and he's fine.  Holy cow. 
[02:04:00]  He's pretty rough, huh?  About the first time I had some...  No, I wouldn't say it.  Because I need to say his last name for the joke.  Yeah.  Oh!  Oh, my God.  I didn't do too bad, did I?  I didn't do too bad.  Look, your headphones are broken.  I got it.  Your headphones are totally broken.  Your glances are on the floor.  It's like you're just a mess.  You know what?  Opie's pretty good.  You can hold his own, man.  I got to give it.  Because Rick's a big guy.  At one point, I did see Opie reached around and punched Rick in the side of the head. 
[02:04:30]  I think he was trying to get his arm around the back.  He punched you in the side of the head, and then Rick just lost it.  And you were like a rag doll at that point, though.  Rick's got some power to him there.  That mega mix.  Oh, look at his arms, man.  I knew I had testosterone powders.  I knew there was going to be a problem there.  Looked like a prison cell workout.  Opie was queen of the weight room ball.  You go to sleep when I tell you to go to sleep. 
[02:05:00]  But not after you toss myself.  I've never seen a brawl like that in this studio.  I wish I had gas.  Oh, man.  If you would have squeaked one out, if you could have, you would have?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Using the animalistic sitting on the opponent to try to...  What the hell was that?  That's what monkeys do.  That was, uh...  What is that?  I was hoping to squeak one out.  Those swollen-ass monkeys do that to, like, you know, to dominate, you know what I mean? 
[02:05:30]  And I do want to stay for the record.  He was trying to give me a wedgie.  Dr. Zayas did that to me.  He sat on it.  From his ear in Cornelius.  Made me look like a buffoon.  Red monkey ass all over my face.  Damn him to hell.  That's a long time coming.  Yeah.  A little tension there, huh?  Yeah, it's a hell of a lot less tense in here now, though.  Yeah, well...  I'm breathing a sigh of relief. 
[02:06:00]  I'll get some tension out tonight.  Oh!  He doesn't quit.  I did what?  That doesn't mean anything.  What, you're going to roll around with another man?  Come on.  It's a joke, isn't it?  Oh!  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of horses.  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  One, two, seven. 
[02:06:30]  Sometimes you feel like a nut.  What do you do?  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  One, two, seven.  All righty.  It is the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  We're going to play a couple quick tunes.  And why drag it out?  Dice is up next.  When Andrew Dice Clay visited the studio last summer, confronted Anthony about his impression.  Some classic radio.  So make sure you're listening.  Coming up after these two tunes. 
[02:07:00]  Crank it up nice and loud.  Here's Allison Chains.  The worst of Opie and Anthony, FM Talk, 1027 NEW.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  Yo, babe.  How you doing?  It's Babe Ruth live from hell, everyone.  How you doing?  You got any whores there for me? 
[02:07:30]  You all right, babe?  Yeah, I'm in hell.  How all right could I be?  They got me coaching a little league team down here.  You're coaching little league in hell?  Little fuckers can't even play.  Or drink.  They're not even interested in a whore like I was.  By the time I was six, I was knocking them down left and right.  A bottle of booze in one hand.  They just said no cigarette in the other. 
[02:08:00]  Wow, Jim.  You know, they invented the voice box just for me.  Yes, I know that.  The electric voice box.  It was actually an accident.  What do you mean?  Well, some chick I was with was using a dildo.  And I accidentally went down on her and realized I could talk.  Ron, you little f**k, hit the ball. 
[02:08:30]  Jesus Christ.  Hey, batter, hey, batter, hey, batter, f**k you.  Hey, babe, have you seen your pal Lou Gehrig down there in hell?  No, that pussy was a good guy.  He went up to heaven.  He did, huh?  Yeah.  He died of that Lou Gehrig disease, you know.  Yeah.  Jeez, what are the odds of that?  I had a nice day, you little prick. 
[02:09:00]  Hey, we're going to get together with Billy Martin and Michael Kennedy tonight for Happy Hour.  Oh, really?  Billy's driving.  Billy's driving.  You can see Michael's face.  It looks like my larynx.  Jesus.  Yeah.  Whoa, whoa, what's wrong, babe?  Babe.  I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I got spilled a beer in my voice box.  My wife's going to kill me.  Wait, babe, you're married? 
[02:09:30]  I did say I was in hell, you know.  Babe, babe, babe, babe.  Oh, there he goes.  Babe Ruth, everyone.  Opie and Anthony, 102.7.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talks at 102.7.  Andrew Dice Clay.  Entering.  What's the deal, Anthony?  Where is he? 
[02:10:00]  Whoa.  There he is.  He looks like me.  Hey, Dice.  What was that?  Get this over with you.  What did that mean?  Like you're throwing me a thing?  No, no, no.  We'll explain.  See, he's, he's a bastard.  He's an obnoxious bastard.  Okay, so who's the guy that does me?  Anthony.  Huh?  Do you?  I don't think I'm going to do you.  All right?  You know, that's not bad.  That's what you said last time I did you.  That's what you said last time. 
[02:10:30]  Yeah.  The only, that's an excellent, that's even, that's almost better than me.  The only difference between you and me is about 35 million.  I hope you still got some of that.  Yeah, I got plenty of it.  Yeah?  That's why I could afford not to wear sleeves.  What's the matter?  Why are you tongue-tied?  Why are you off on the phone?  Is this the guy?  I thought we were getting along.  No, we are getting along, but we got to, we got to have fun for the people in their 
[02:11:00]  cars going home that have been at work all day dealing with the Chinaman boss to listen  to something.  Well, okay?  I got some clips of Anthony doing you.  Yeah, let's hear some.  You want to hear one?  Yeah.  When a bad mouth shoo.  What?  What?  Oh, see, he's very sensitive.  I don't bad mouth.  He doesn't.  It's an homage.  I think, uh, homage.  What does that word mean, Kenny?  It means that he bad mouths you.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, when it says you're playing chuckles for 15 people. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, wait, I got to tell you.  Well, maybe that was my choice.  And it wasn't chuckles.  It was Laugh Your Balls Off in Poughkeepsie.  No, I, chuckles.  I did two albums in front of 15 people.  Yeah?  Yeah.  See?  Dangerfields, but do you know how many people bought those albums?  How many?  I could guess, Jerkoff.  Millions.  Yeah, take a guess.  So you address me in the proper fashion, I'm not going to talk. 
[02:12:00]  All right?  Well, I didn't mean anything by Jerkoff face.  What did you mean?  That's like a compliment.  That's when you become friends.  All right, asswipe.  I could roll with that.  See, that doesn't hurt me.  No, I know.  That's like a nice thing for you to say.  You can wallow, wallow in your millions, and you don't feel bad.  Because only buddies could talk like that to each other, you see?  Yeah.  I don't call a farmer, you know, J-O-Face. 
[02:12:30]  He hasn't earned that from me yet.  He's really late right away.  Maybe me and you could do a show like doing my twin or something.  Yeah.  Or he's not as handsome.  He could be the evil dice.  He's got the goatee ready.  Yeah, you know what I mean?  We do like a sitcom on some network that might have me.  The handsome dice and the retarded dice.  I guess you'll be playing the retarded dice there, Kenny.  Look.  Look at this guy.  What is with the hurt feelings all of a sudden? 
[02:13:00]  Come on.  Hey, Kenny, I found the clip you were talking about.  Why?  Let's hear it.  I'm going to be at a laugh till you crop your pants, coincidentally enough, in Allentown, Pennsylvania.  Where did that come from?  No, what I like is coincidentally enough.  Because that's another word I don't understand.  Never said.  That was never said, huh?  No.  So where are you performing this weekend?  Or in any bathroom alone?  Where are you performing?  I perform here all week. 
[02:13:30]  Do you do stand-up comedy?  No.  Why would I want to travel the country?  That's where you jerk-off face.  Staying in lousy hotels.  Well, I stay in the best hotels.  When you die.  Maybe back in 88.  Huh?  What now?  Holiday Inn?  Best Western.  Little bit.  Little bit.  A little bit now.  Well, what's the matter?  Now it starts coming your way.  A little bit.  And the Diceman gets a little pissed off.  Wait a minute now.  Huh?  Huh?  Maybe if you find your own personality, you can make a living doing stand-up comedy. 
[02:14:00]  Personality.  Personality.  Let me hear you say that one.  Huh?  Say it.  I don't understand what you're saying.  You say to me, you got good personality.  Say that.  Just say that.  You got a good personality.  Personality.  Now until you learn that, you really don't have the impression down.  So I'll try it too now.  I don't think people are going to pay me here.  No, no, no.  That's not what I said.  What you said? 
[02:14:30]  That's not what I said.  I said personality.  Personality means you got personal.  Now I ask you.  You got a good personality.  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Huh?  That's not what I said.  What I said is personality.  Personality means you got personal.  That's you making no sense.  No, that makes no sense.  You babble.  I'm hearing babble.  No, what you're saying makes no sense.  What I'm saying is a statement.  Why is that dead air on the air?  Why aren't you talking now?  Talk to me when I talk to you. 
[02:15:00]  Because I don't understand the word you're saying.  Personality means you got personal.  You see?  Now everybody driving in that car.  Stop.  Explain.  They're going, I understand.  How come jerk-off face don't understand?  Again with the jerk-off face.  I'll be on radio stations all over the country.  I'll promote you.  Anthony jerk-off face.  How's that going to feel?  I can't even do an impression of you because I haven't heard you yet.  I heard, uh, Opie, how do you not kill your parents?  How you doing? 
[02:15:30]  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I got a lot of personality.  I mean, you got personnel.  Try that one, Anthony.  You're listening to Anthony and Opie on WNEW 102.7 Pharma.  It's Opie and Anthony and Andrew Dice Clay and Kenny.  Upside of Kenny.  I hear you.  So, uh, you want to talk to some folks there, Dice?  That's up to you.  Yeah, what the hell?  Let's go.  John, what's up?  What's up, man?  You guys are great. 
[02:16:00]  I love you, but Anthony, man.  What?  What are you, Percy?  What?  You're making fun of him for like a week and a half.  Now you can't say it.  It's not making fun.  It's talking.  It's a parody, and I'm going to let it go.  Oh, come on, talking.  What did I do?  Let this guy talk.  What did he say that I should get mad at?  Because I don't get mad.  Wait a minute.  I don't get mad, so tell me.  All right.  I'll, um, well, we got some, uh, it's usually, all right.  Hey, I sold out Madison Square Garden, huh?  They haven't called since, but I sold it out in record time.  All right? 
[02:16:30]  You know, stuff like that.  The imitation.  It's nothing personal, Dice.  No, it's very flattering.  You're, you're, you're a character.  You know?  Exactly.  You're a character.  It's like I'm a walking cartoon.  That's what I'm saying, right?  It's like I'm not even Newman.  I don't.  What up, yeah?  That's all.  I'm a cartoon to you.  I'm a few laughs for you.  I'm not around, and you can just say whatever you want.  That's what this guy's saying.  You know, now I'm glad to hear you saying it.  Then again, who is he to call up and look to start a problem, you know, between me and you? 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, you jerk off.  Huh?  I don't understand this guy.  What's wrong with these people?  Everybody's looking for a beating.  Well, I got more examples of Anthony.  Yeah, let me, let me hear some.  Oh, Christ, come on.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  I ain't been funny since 86.  Now, that isn't even true.  Now, that isn't true.  Now, wait a minute.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  See, that was done with computer generation.  Look at me.  Yeah, if we were in a court of law, what was your answer just now? 
[02:17:30]  That's not true.  That was computer generated.  Now, how do you feel about me as you, Anthony, for this person?  First of all, I don't think you did the Rodney thing until maybe 87.  So, it's not even, like, logistically correct.  It's 88.  88.  Right, see?  That's right.  And you were hysterical.  Mr. Clay, I got another example for you.  Okay.  Hey, this is Diceman.  I used to be somebody.  Now, I can't even sell out a closet. 
[02:18:00]  Hey, now, wait a minute.  Now, when was that?  That was before, Phil.  Before I went to Governor's and saw a packed club of raving fans.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Before the night.  You see, I got to forgive him because of what he just said.  What?  What he said.  Well, he did.  You had disappeared for a while, okay?  You had.  Do you?  You know something?  Yeah, to me.  I was a big fan.  Shut your mouth.  Kenny, when was the last special? 
[02:18:30]  HBO special.  Assume the position.  When did it air?  Three years ago.  Okay.  What year was that?  Ninety-six.  Yeah, ninety-six.  Okay.  You said eighty-six.  Yeah.  You said eighty-six.  Kenny, how many homes tuned in in nineteen ninety-six?  Ninety-five percent.  Okay.  Who's tuning in for you if you go on TV, Anthony?  Nice.  Your parents?  See, it wasn't Andrew Dice Clay. 
[02:19:00]  It was the Dice character I'm mocking.  Oh, I get it.  It's a cartoon.  The cartoon guy.  Oh, now it's all up.  It's like Fred Flintstone or something.  So you don't have another example, do you?  Oh, sure.  All right.  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  I'm available for weddings, garments, and sweet sixteens.  How did you know I was doing that?  And I'm not even banging the door.  Come on.  How did you know I was doing that?  I'll show you a nice one.  That must be a treat, huh?  Hey, read the door.  Then come on.  See, he's an instigator.  I didn't say nothing, Mr. Clay.  Look.  The other funny thing is, you know, the funny thing is, about this whole little thing with 
[02:19:30]  him.  Yeah.  That he's calling himself Andrew Dice Clay.  No.  And the other funny thing is, I'm going to say you're not.  No, this is what I'm leading up to.  Don't give the punchline away.  When you use somebody's name, number one, like, that's called, like, um, what is that  word?  Infringement.  Infringement.  That's one.  Defamation of character.  That's two.  Huh?  So here comes another 35 million from the station that hired you. 
[02:20:00]  Now, we'll probably have to settle.  You'll probably lose your job and be with the hot dog stand downstairs, but I'm still  going to love you, because I know it's a goof.  Would you like another example?  Okay, let's take another night.  You got one?  Contrary to popular belief, the Diceman can read.  Now, wait a minute.  Hold it.  Wait a minute now.  Here.  Here.  I'm going to read out in this, um, this educational magazine I'm looking at with a chick in a 
[02:20:30]  bikini called Stuff.  And just the fact that I was able, even though it's big letters, I was able to read that.  Anthony, we are in Dice's court of law.  Did I not read that word correctly?  Yes, you did, Dice.  And are you, in fact, the person that said that on that recording he just played?  Yes or no, Anthony?  It was taken out of context.  Yes or no, Anthony?  Did you see that?  Yes, taken out of context. 
[02:21:00]  Yes or no?  Answer the question.  Yes, out of context.  He can actually...  Oh, well, you know what?  Since it's out of context, why don't you play us a little more?  I sold out Madison Square Garden.  Hey, we got the Olive Garden checking in.  I think they got a spot for you.  Is this the Olive Garden?  Yeah, this is the Olive Garden.  How are you guys doing over there?  All right.  Do you want to talk to Dice?  Yeah, I'd like to speak to the Dice, man.  Hey, Olive Garden, what's your problem?  Yeah, we want to know if you could sell out a table of four.  Table of four?  Are you insulting me? 
[02:21:30]  Are you insulting me?  You don't think I could sell out a table of four?  Let me tell you something.  Last week, I was at Burger King 15 people.  All right?  So don't tell me about a table of four.  What time?  All right, Olive Garden.  All right, peace.  Bye.  Hey, call me.  You think I'm going to call?  I'm going to use the case.  Look, did he call himself Dice again?  Kenny, that's another 35.  I'm keeping track. 
[02:22:00]  Now, wait a minute.  This is all done in a spirit of fun and laughter.  Okay, and I'm going to laugh when I see what the hot dog stands.  I'm going to come over.  I'm going to go, Anthony, look at you now.  See, yeah, sauerkraut on that bun, all right?  And now I'm going to go, Anthony, do me a little.  Do me a little.  Say you're me again.  That's what I'm going to say to you.  Now, come on.  And then your wife's going to leave with me in the nice big stretch limo with the jacuzzi in it,  champagne in the back. 
[02:22:30]  We put on one of my house tapes.  We get all licking up and crazy.  And she'll be throwing my hot dog out the window.  Look at this, Anthony.  He does have the apple.  And it does look like a zebra.  Hey, Merry Christmas, New York.  You're listening to Andrew Dice Clay.  Not, you know, the wannabe.  Anthony.  Kofi and Anthony and Andrew Dice Clay and... 
[02:23:00]  All right, we want to take another call.  Yeah, we can do that.  Maybe you'd like to speak for me.  You're so used to it.  All right.  Mike, what's up?  In favor, ask Anthony when you're going to play at my grandma's house.  All right, that might have been a club that came up in conversation.  Oh, wait, we got another thing here about my grandma's house.  Well, we got a few more.  Oh, come on.  I thought we would throw this.  Put your asses off up in Poughkeepsie.  How many people...  And ha-ha, I just laughed at my sack cave thing. 
[02:23:30]  You're all alone now, Anthony.  He would make up comedy clubs.  That is a field.  Look.  He would make up comedy clubs that you would be appearing at.  Come on.  Oh, is that what it is?  Yeah.  Now, look.  I don't know if the cartoon is going to play anywhere.  We see...  No, let me be straight.  We see the Dice Man, 1988.  Buster opened the scene.  Rodney Dangerfield special.  You break.  Shoot.  To become the biggest comic ever in history.  That's what you're saying.  Right.  Shoot.  So, how do you keep that level?  You can't.  I rest my case.  I know. 
[02:24:00]  I make a verdict from the jury.  But then...  No, I'm done.  I'm done with the case.  We can take the next call now.  But then what?  I didn't do enough for you.  No.  You just think you've been coming up with plenty of material because of me.  Exactly.  See, you reach a huge place.  Yeah, but don't you think a performer should try other things in a career?  Of course.  I mean, I did about 900 arenas.  How many should I do to make you happy? 
[02:24:30]  The bit, the bit is, your attitude is still like, I'm Madison Square Garden, I'm the biggest  selling comedian of all time.  It's that.  I got...  I know.  But that's the bit.  Because...  Oh, is that the bit?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  Hey, Ronna.  Well, Mr. Clay, Mr. Clay, I got an example of Anthony trying to come up with new material.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Let's hear this.  Do you have any new material before you leave, Dice?  All new stuff.  I do new rhymes.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Let's hear one of your new rhymes.  You're Bill Clinton and Monica.  Hey, you biggie. 
[02:25:00]  It's funny stuff, huh?  Yeah.  Number one.  It's top shelf stuff.  You're wetting your pants over there.  Oh, I'm wetting my pants over there.  No.  All right.  Number one, it's a Linda Tripp poem.  All right.  All right.  All right.  So now you'll be smirching my material.  Be smirching?  Linda Tripp poem.  I don't know what that will mean.  Be smirching?  You understand?  When I do the Linda Tripp poem, they'll be calling you and going,  why did you not do the Linda Tripp poem? 
[02:25:30]  You were just making something up.  Weren't you?  Perhaps that will happen.  That's the way it's going to come down.  See, I didn't want to get into this.  Opie, him and Rick, hot enough stuff.  Obviously, I don't know how much you've done it, but get into it.  It's your life.  Dice, the people get a big...  I don't know how this woman lives with you.  The people get a big kick out of it.  They look around the house and go,  honey, cook me some egg.  You know, now it's time to go... 
[02:26:00]  You know, I'm going to take the dog out for a...  That's exactly what it is.  Now I'm going to be impersonal.  It means you're cooking the kids to go personal.  I don't even know what that is.  Exactly, because that takes true talent to figure that out.  Say it.  I can't.  I can't.  I don't even know what you said.  Then you will be asked that in the court of law.  In the court of law.  In the court of law.  Personality.  I mean, you've got to get to go personal.  Because until you can do that, 
[02:26:30]  this lawsuit will be pending.  Dice, remember, I was the one who helped you out.  Now, remember.  Now, wait a minute.  You're in it, too.  Opie, I'm going to get you out of this little, you know,  10 by 10 room.  Believe me.  You'll be traveling around with me, Club Soda, Murray, Happy Face,  and a couple laughs.  I said Murray.  Oh, okay.  Bring the broads and by the dozen.  You're going to have to unload this chick.  I'm sorry.  I mean, nice girl and everything,  but they're all over the place.  It's like toilet paper.  There you go.  I went to it. 
[02:27:00]  I don't know why you had to start all this, man.  I have a little bit of fun.  See, but the only thing you've got in his favor  is that he does a good impression.  Oh, thank you.  I've heard.  He does many others, by the way.  Who else you do?  I can't remember now.  Who else does he do?  Charlton Heston.  Charlton Heston.  That's more of a goof on Charlton Heston than really Chuck Heston.  So, wait, what are you saying?  What you're doing to me is not a goof?  I try to think of that as a more accurate interpretation of your voice. 
[02:27:30]  So who do you think he does good, Opie?  Al Sharpton.  Well, those are all like parodies.  He does like Charles Corral really good.  What are you doing parodies?  What's he doing on me?  Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan, he does real well.  But Ronald Reagan wouldn't even know it anymore.  Yeah, that's true.  That's why it's fun.  I don't know.  People that pay.  I don't know.  Popeye.  Just wait until they.  Popeye.  Nobody cares.  It's a cartoon.  But then again, like he has said on the radio, I am a cartoon.  I'm not a human being.  I'm a cartoon. 
[02:28:00]  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  And you're listening.  No, not Anthony Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice.  And you're listening to Opie and the guy that wants to be me show.  On WNEW 102.7.  Hey, look at the name.  Hi, N.E.W.  Yeah, hi.  I'd like to speak to Popeye Dice Clay.  Popeye Dice Clay?  Yeah.  Hey, olives.  How's your pusky?  Hey, get, get, get, go. 
[02:28:30]  Huh?  Hey, Pluto, you bloated piece of crap, huh?  Look at you, you fat bastard.  Oh, get, get, get, get, get, get.  So the sea hair comes up to me.  And she goes, hey, Popeye Dice Clay, I want some of your cocks.  Oh, get, get, get, get.  So I give it to her.  Hey, get, get, get, get.  There you go.  Now let's hear it the other way.  It's a spinach bin. 
[02:29:00]  So this chick comes up to me at the banks.  And I put my tongues in her ass.  We win a fight.  You or Brutus.  I'll kick his ass.  Oh, man.  All right, man.  All right, dude.  See you later. 
[02:29:30]  All righty.  What's happening, man?  Hopefully you guys are enjoying the stuff when Dice was in studio.  Now, usually that's about it.  But I was digging through some more tapes and found when Dice called back,  he left the studio, said goodbye to the guys, blah, blah, blah, the whole boring thing.  And he was down on the street and somebody pulled up in a car.  I guess they knew he was coming out of the building.  They wanted to meet him.  They had the show on in the car. 
[02:30:00]  And Anthony starts doing some more Dice after Dice had left the studio.  So this is like a whole soap opera.  So Dice gets on his phone and calls back into the studio right in the middle of a spot break.  So this is where this phone call comes from.  It's like ten minutes after the last of when Dice left the studio the day.  All right?  So here's something you've never heard before.  Well, I've only heard once if you even heard the original interview.  All righty?  It's when Dice calls back during the spot break to confront Anthony about doing more impressions. 
[02:30:30]  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  What's the matter?  No, I'm walking in the street.  People pull up.  It's still on in the cars.  And Anthony don't know what to stop.  I'd be good.  If he had a problem with me, he should have said it right there and then.  I gave him the opportunity.  The fans called in. 
[02:31:00]  They said, if you've got a problem.  And I took it.  All right.  The guy is goofing around.  And now you open your mouth again.  I didn't say nothing.  You said plenty.  Hey, listen, Jerkoff.  You'll come back here.  Well, I'm the Jerkoff.  Maybe you're the Jerkoff.  Okay?  You don't want to do this.  I try to come on the first.  See, I'm never the one to pull the first punch.  That's not me.  Like, even like all the Jerkoffs that called in, all the tough guys that are in their apartment 
[02:31:30]  stoned going, my life means nothing, so let me insult somebody else.  Is that what I'm going to start?  Is that what I've got to start thinking about you?  Or do I think, hey, the guy does a good impression.  If he can get a few laughs off of it, let him get a few laughs.  You tell me what you want me to think.  It could go two ways.  We're friends.  Oh, there's a problem.  And if I've got a problem, you've really got a problem.  Hey, guy, I hear you, Dice.  You don't want to die.  Hey, hey.  We left everything with nice, be nice. 
[02:32:00]  Good for everybody.  I saw your wife downstairs.  I gave a quick squeeze and a kiss.  You know what I mean?  I told the time I thought he did a good impression.  And now I'm walking down the street.  Guy pulls over.  He goes, Dice, you've got to hear this guy.  You've got to hear his first call.  All right, people are instigating.  I haven't said one word.  I was listening in the frigging car over here.  I've got to go.  I've got to work the streets with this nonsense now.  And everybody's coming out.  Don't listen to me. 
[02:32:30]  If he's got a problem, let him say it.  Dice, it's Opie.  I'll confess.  All right, we've got to make up.  Here's a hot chick walking by me now.  Honey, you want to be on the radio?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Thank you.  You're too good for everybody.  You want your man on the street now?  Hey, honey, can I clear you up?  I'm sorry.  I'm over here now.  Thank you.  You know what I mean?  I think everybody on the street.  I'll put all kinds of people up.  Hey, pal, say hello.  Hey, what's going on?  Say what's happening.  Did you hear that guy?  I'll go over to another guy that's actually very mad at you for what you did. 
[02:33:00]  Here it is.  What's your name?  His name's Cliff.  Hold on.  All right.  Who do you think you're all?  Who do you think you're all trying to have a party like that?  You wish you're all him.  You wish you're all him.  All right, Cliff.  All right.  Hey, Dice.  Hey, Dice.  Get out of here.  Kenny, get this guy out of here.  Hey, Dice, can you talk to these people in the middle of the street for us?  This is the middle of the street.  I don't even know where we are, but we got some hard-looking numbers walking on.  Now, Dice, I'll go on record and say I consider you a pal now. 
[02:33:30]  All right.  So we are friends, and when I come back to town, I'm coming back in there.  Yeah.  And I want to hear more of these clips.  Unless Howard makes up with you.  What's that?  Unless Howard makes up with you, and then you'll be on Howard's show.  No, no.  He's got to apologize.  He's got to be a man and apologize.  I said that to the guy calling in.  All right.  I don't owe him no apology.  Yeah, but...  You know what?  You guys are fun.  Cool.  Well, a lot of people thought that we should have beat you up or something.  I don't get that, but...  Well, that you were going to come in here and beat me up.  Yeah.  Isn't that funny how everybody's brave when they're on the phone or when they're on TV, 
[02:34:00]  but the minute they face you, all of a sudden they clam up.  You know, we had you in the studio, and then I'm like, hey, man, I like this guy, and  he's making people laugh, and we had some fun.  That's all I care about.  Who's this now?  I'll be...  Yeah, Anthony...  He's a pretty even-tempered one.  Well, Anthony...  I got no use for you.  I like people with emotions.  All right.  All right, Anthony.  Anthony, let him have it.  Let him have it, Anthony.  Anthony's got a lot of emotion in him.  He's got a lot of problems, a lot of pentabagas. 
[02:34:30]  I relate to him.  Hey, Dice, but...  I don't relate to farmers.  Hey, Dice, because of you, Anthony, can't change his shirt.  You missed the count.  The only thing I got to milk is between my...  You know what I'm saying?  The bus driver's just looking at me.  He's looking for a beat now.  I just passed a hard-looking redhead, and you know what they do for me.  What?  Oh, me and Jack, I've got to keep the guy puzzled out.  All right, guys, I'm going to let you go.  All right, please.  Don't make me clap back. 
[02:35:00]  All right, Dice, come see us again, all right?  That's right.  I'll be looking for you.  All right.  Don't worry, I know just where to find you.  All right.  All right, goodbye.  Take it easy.  How you doing?  This is Andrew Dice Clay.  And you're the...  No, not Anthony Dice Clay.  Andrew Dice...  And you're listening to Opie and the guy that wants to be me show.  On WNEW 102.7.  You deserve the bet. 
[02:35:30]  But that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 102.7.  Ah, Jerry.  Yeah.  Hey.  Did we get the rusty trombone?  There's all kinds of names for things.  What, Jerry?  Okay.  Being very careful is the rusty trombone.  It's, uh...  You're getting your salad tossed, and the girl reaches around and starts playing the trombone. 
[02:36:00]  That is the rusty trombone.  I thought I heard it all next.  The rusty trombone.  That's the rusty trombone.  All right. 
[02:36:30]  A rusty trombone is best with a filthy whore.  She'll reach around and get you off with her hand.  All the while, she'll lick your spot by your tiny balloon nut.  Hope you didn't eat too much bran.  A rusty trombone may not be moral.  While I think this sounds kind of gay. 
[02:37:00]  I'd rather get some coral with the finger up my butt.  But fetch me what the hell I'm not.  Come on, honey.  Start the music.  Yeah.  You play that well.  Opie and Anthony.  Cunnilingus and psychiatry brought us to this.  On FM Talk at 1027.  The Talk You Can't Ignore.  What's going on with Kathy Lee Gifford?  I read a disturbing little article in the post today. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, I was looking at that, too.  It seems like her viewers are very, very pissed off at her because she's been going topless on the show.  Or bra-less.  Not topless.  Bra-less, I mean.  Yeah, she's wearing these little dress numbers and letting her boobs swing.  And, you know, gravity's taking its toll on Kathy Lee.  Are they hanging below, like, the coffee table they have set out?  Not yet.  Kathy Lee, put your bra on!  Gilman, look at these! 
[02:38:00]  They're hanging like sweat socks full of sand!  You think the nipples point down on those babies, or what?  I really can't tell, you know?  No.  They just look like they're getting elongated, is what it is.  They look kind of long.  And, um, I don't know.  I think she's trying to get attention because now Regis has this new TV show.  Sure.  This, I Want to Be a Millionaire.  Right.  And, uh, for some reason, I guess the rubes in the Midwest are all tuning into this thing. 
[02:38:30]  And it's taken off.  All the rubes that call him up on this stupid show in the morning.  We have the question, Gilman.  What's the question, for God's sake?  Yesterday, Tom Sillick was on.  What commercial did he first star in?  I read the spectacular.  This here, uh, Matilda.  And I live in Wyoming, and I listen to you.  I watch your show every day.  I don't care.  I'm shooting.  I don't care.  Well, get to the answer, you slutbag. 
[02:39:00]  Kathy Lee, look at her pants.  They're on the coffee table.  The same rubes.  And they're watching that new show, and now it's a huge hit.  Yeah.  So Regis has a hit on his hands.  So maybe Kathy Lee's getting jealous and trying to flash some skin.  Well, maybe people pay attention to her.  Maybe she should turn around and show everyone her balloon knot.  That's a ratings grabber, I'm telling you.  Kathy Lee, show your balloon knot. 
[02:39:30]  Gilman, look at her balloon knot.  And then Kathy Lee can turn around and give Regis the rusty trombone live on the show.  Gilman, I'm getting the rusty trombone.  And then, like, Regis can turn around and give Kathy Lee the dirty Sanchez.  Let me reach around and get some on my finger.  Gilman, look, she's got a mustache.  That's the dirty Sanchez.  The dirty Sanchez.  And then Gilman, because he's such a tool, could get, like, the Cleveland steamer.  A Cleveland steamer, Gilman. 
[02:40:00]  It could happen.  Tony Pitts getting Gilman a Cleveland steamer.  Could happen, right?  Now, that I might tune in.  Let's see all those hijinks.  All right, let's rehash real fast.  Now, the post saying Kathy Lee is now going braless.  Yeah.  All right.  Now, tell me you wouldn't tune in every morning if you knew that between now and the millennium.  Tuck it, you bitch! 
[02:40:30]  Tuck it!  I love it!  Just hear me out, though.  Between now and the millennium, this is their new promotion for their show.  You're almost hitting prostate!  Gilman!  My God.  My gosh.  You've gone too far, but I love it.  All right.  So, the big promotion is now between the millennium, okay?  Uh-huh.  Kathy Lee will perform, live on the show, the Rusty Trombone to Regis.  Tell me you're not watching every day, waiting for that to happen. 
[02:41:00]  Where's the reach around, Gilman?  Kathy Lee's giving me one!  The Rusty Trombone!  Dead deep, you bitch!  And then the grand finale, Gilman gets the Cleveland Steamer.  You're watching every day!  Art Moore's giving him a Cleveland Steamer!  And who gets the Dirty Sanchez, then?  Kathy Lee!  Oh, my God. 
[02:41:30]  My roids are acting up, Gilman!  She's giving me the Rusty Tuba!  Oh, my God.  Sometimes joy, Philbin, gives it to me.  You'd watch, though, right?  Right?  I certainly would.  Like tomorrow on, you know, Regis and Kathy Lee.  Kathy Lee's going to show everyone her blow nut.  You're watching, right?  Oh, I'm there.  You're there, of course.  I can't believe it, Gilman. 
[02:42:00]  I'm getting the Rusty Trombone!  If they could see me now with the Rusty Trombone!  Sing it, Kathy Lee!  She's playing it!  I can't believe it, Gilman!  And look at you!  With your Cleveland Steamer!  And Kathy Lee with a Dirty Sanchez! 
[02:42:30]  Thank you.  Okay, I was making sure that was in there.  So then Art has to show the blow nut, I guess, because every one of them needs something to do.  Art Moore had prunes!  He's giving the Cleveland Steamer!  I love the Rusty Trombone!  Well, we crack ourselves up.  That's for sure.  Eddie, what's up?  First of all, first of all, her boobs aren't sagging. 
[02:43:00]  These damn things started, I'd say, almost down to her belly button.  Whoa, really?  Have you ever looked at her and saw her boobs are in the middle of her body?  It's a freak show!  There you go!  I can't believe it!  I've never seen cans like this!  But that the broad rubs on her thigh!  Oh, wow.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:43:30]  Is this the best radio you guys could come up with?  1027.  What is Mr. Container doing here?  Don't even try to figure it out.  Just go along with it.  What happened?  1027.  All righty, what's happening, man?  This is Rick, producer of the Opie and Anthony show, sitting in for the guys.  We are doing worst of all week in the midst of some awesome stuff that we just dug up.  Lots of requests for Dice took care of all of it when Dice was in the studio.  If you missed it, too bad.  We're moving on. 
[02:44:00]  We've got more stuff coming up.  And if you've got any requests for the worst of show, 212-757-1027.  And he's telling me that we're getting a lot of requests from Mad Dog from a particular group of people who, I guess, coincidentally enough, work with Mad Dog.  Wow, what a coincidence.  I guess they don't get enough of them there in the studio.  They've got to hear our version of them as well. 
[02:44:30]  I don't know.  Maybe it's just me.  But I think that's really freaking funny.  So, to appease our fellow brethren and, I guess, company co-workers in Queens, here you go by request.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027, the talk you can't ignore.  It's FM Talk, 1027, talk you can't ignore. 
[02:45:00]  Our phone number, 212-757-1027.  We have another exciting show planned for you guys today.  Mike and the Mad Dog talking about David Cohn signing a one-year deal for the next four hours.  We'll be talking about that for the entire Mike and the Mad Dog show.  Well, what do you think he's going to take?  What do you think?  He's going to go with the big bills every week for the pay?  What do you think, hundreds and fifties?  Or you think a lot for the tens and twenties? 
[02:45:30]  How is this man getting paid?  And what's he spending his money on?  So, they'll talk about that until you're sick of it.  I think he's signing a contract with a big ballpoint.  We'll take your calls on that.  You think he should use a flare pen of a big ballpoint, Maggie?  Hey, Mad Dog, how are you going to compete with Opie and Anthony?  They're going to have a girl give birth on their show today.  Jesus.  How do you know how we supposed to do this?  Get shot, giant shot, Nick shot.  How do you know how we supposed to do this? 
[02:46:00]  Mike, you fat bastard, you pregnant?  You gotta be.  Maggie, I'm going to stick an oven and stuff a roaster where the sun don't shine.  Deliver it like a kid.  It's the only way we can compete.  Get me out of here.  Our ratings are slipping.  They're slipping.  And then on Gay Rock, they got 92-minute rock blocks all afternoon.  And here, we're going to try to have a girl give birth.  We can't promise it's going to happen, but we're definitely going to try.  I'm going to try to start doing imitations. 
[02:46:30]  Hey, it's Tom Brokenjaw.  All right.  Mad Dog, let's hear your Tom Brokenjaw.  All right.  Hey, how about some music?  All right.  Hold on.  I'll get your music.  I love music.  Hold on.  You're really getting uptight, man.  Well, you know, when you do sports talk radio, it's a little rough when your team's a sucker ass.  But I always supposed to do that when we have the Aggies.  Everybody tune it in.  Everybody loves the Aggies.  Now, the Aggies, we can't even talk about that because there's no baseball for the months.  The teams stink. 
[02:47:00]  I gotta compete.  I gotta win.  All right.  So you want to do voices now on your show?  I'm going to give it a whirl.  All right.  You want to...  I can do it.  I can do it.  All right.  Mad Dog, do you want to start with your Brokenjaw?  Yeah, we're doing a little...  I'm going to do what they call a little riffing.  All right.  Let's...  Back in the Mad Dog.  All right.  We're going to do a little Tom Broker.  A little news break.  How you doing, Tom Broker, dog?  Everything nightly news.  Why can't I say Akili Marvo?  Wait, I can't even say Akili Marvo. 
[02:47:30]  Tom Broker.  Jesus Christ, this is hard.  How about that Mickey Dice Clay?  All right.  Let's hear some Clay.  Hey, yee, yee.  So I'm out of line with this chick, and she's got a tongue.  Well, I can't even say that.  Oh.  Hey, that works.  I can do Popeye.  Let's hear your Popeye.  Hey, that's pretty good.  Hey, that's not bad.  I don't do that bad.  All right.  Well, blow me down.  Let's hear a little more...  Blow me down, Mickey. 
[02:48:00]  Let's hear some more Brokenjaw.  Everything nightly news.  Tom Broker, dog.  Tom Broker.  Hey, let me look at the paper.  I'm trying to rip.  Rip.  Yeah, turn over the paper.  You're not used to seeing the front page.  Oh, look at that.  You go right to the sports page.  Everyone's happy.  Tony's back in pinstripe for one more year.  Right.  Then on the other side of the paper...  Hey, what's this?  Wow, this is serious news.  Yeah.  I ain't never seen nothing like this before.  What the hell? 
[02:48:30]  Well, what is...  People are dying.  What are you talking about?  And a poor kid hit by a bus.  Right.  Oh, my God.  A banker.  Right.  Set on fire.  Right.  Oh, my God.  Joey Adams is dead.  This is awful, Mikey.  What about the Cuban...  Wait a minute.  I'm doing my impression of a cocky bad dog.  What about the Cuban kid?  Yeah, I think I got a Yankees on a sign.  Really?  He probably ought to be a damn good left-hander. 
[02:49:00]  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  Reverend Allen's been arrested.  Yeah.  I am outraged.  I am outraged.  You want to try a Reverend Allen impression?  Yeah.  All right.  I am outraged.  I am outraged.  Why is the white man always picking on me, Mikey?  Damn you.  Damn you out of hell.  Look, I'm doing Heston.  Oh, you want to do Heston?  Mikey!  Give me Rocky ass!  I want Red Band to Rocky ass! 
[02:49:30]  Is this working?  Check the ratings.  Hopefully we're winning.  I think I got a niche for this voice thing, Mikey.  You're not bad.  A little more Heston.  Damn you out of hell!  Take your stick and paws off me, you damn dirty ape, and you too, Mikey!  Damn you!  Damn you!  I remember when I was on a Planet of the Apes.  Yeah.  I had six little monkeys!  Check them out.  How are they?  They've got to be coming out.  This is brand new to me. 
[02:50:00]  All right.  I got one last impression for you.  All right.  Ah, look at my camel toe.  Look at my camel toe, Mikey.  Check this out.  It looks like the Yankee dugout.  Look at the size of this thing.  Look at the clubhouse.  You've got to imitate Celine Dion.  Oh.  And you, baby!  I send this song out to those who lived during the tragedy of the Titanic. 
[02:50:30]  A special song goes out to the Sanhedrin.  The Sanhedrin.  Sponsored by Tarotor.  Would you like to do the dirty voice for everyone, too?  Yeah, yeah.  You got a bitch on the phone?  I call the bitches to get the rapes.  I say, bitch.  You know, scumbag.  Bastard. 
[02:51:00]  I got to start using that, you know, blue language.  All right.  Well...  We got to get in trouble, Mikey.  Yeah, I'll be an Anthony.  Always in it.  Always bad.  Always getting in the world of crap.  Until we get some kind of complaints and almost get fired.  We can't even compete.  Get a broad on the phone.  All right.  Let's talk to Tina.  Hey, Tina.  Yeah.  You're on the phone.  I'm not going to be a dog.  I'm going to use my dirty girl voice on you.  Go ahead.  Hey, you're a dirty girl.  You filthy bitch. 
[02:51:30]  You're getting off, aren't you?  Absolutely.  You're a dirty girl.  You like it, don't you?  Yeah, you got to slow it down a little, bad dog.  Hey, it's Hammer Tuesday.  Yeah.  Why don't you come over here?  Get back here, Hammer.  You can use it.  You look a little backed up.  Look, see?  I'm getting blue.  Hey, Tina.  Yeah.  You gave your boyfriend a hammer?  My husband?  Your husband?  Both of them.  Your boyfriend and your husband.  You whore.  You're a fucking whore. 
[02:52:00]  Look at me.  It's like it.  I don't know if the dirty girl voice is working.  You like me, Tina, don't you?  Sure.  Making a dog out of hand.  You're a fucking whore.  Hey, I'm like the dice man.  Hey, Mikey, you want to see my junk?  Mikey, give me your hammer.  All right.  Well, I think you're almost there with your impressions, Mad Dog.  The only way we can compete.  All right. 
[02:52:30]  Let's take a quick break.  We'll regroup, and we'll be back.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Pro men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  That shoe is for Mike and Amanda, who you guys beat.  I'm glad you stayed.  All right?  I guess we beat them in the ratings.  Yeah, you beat them in the ratings.  Well, you've got to give me and Anthony a lot of credit.  They came out pretty strong in the late part of the year.  And I think they were kicking ass.  I mean, they whipped us.  We're looking like little bitches. 
[02:53:00]  What do you think about that, Mike?  That's right, Dwarg.  I'm feeling like a little smack bitch.  How long are we supposed to sit here while they get naked midgets in the air studio?  How are we competing against that?  Yeah, unless you get something like the Knicks playing in the playoffs.  Yeah, hopefully we'll get a subway series.  And that'll compensate for girls shooting stuff out of who knows where.  I wish I compete against that.  It's terrible, isn't it?  We have to talk about coney pitching. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, you've got snatch pigeons.  Hey, Mikey.  Yeah.  Why don't you give me a rusty trombone?  No, that's okay.  I'll give you a dirty sanction.  So I can feel the ratings going up already.  Give me a rusty trombone.  I remember the time I was in the back of a tall roader and got a Cleveland Steamer.  Oh, really?  Oh, yeah.  What was his name?  Mikey. 
[02:54:00]  We've got to give him a lot of credit.  After a lot of hot dogs at Yankee Stadium.  Yeah.  Wow.  Sometimes I can still smell it.  You can ice in conflict.  Piss me off, okay?  I'm still laughing at that last line.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:54:30]  That was for Mike and the crew at the other station.  Did I say Mike?  No, I'm just kidding.  Not really.  More of the worst of On The Way, including some broken jaw.  In the meantime, here's a quick little music break.  Where's the Volpe and Anthony, FM Talk, 1027.  Volpe and Anthony, 1027.  Mr. Sullivan.  Yes.  Is this the two idiots?  Yeah.  You want to sue us?  Yes.  I would just like to inform both of you, gentlemen, that there will be a lawyer talking to your management team. 
[02:55:00]  Because I have been not only embarrassed, but harassed.  Really?  Do you understand this?  No.  And don't even, don't even not even go close by saying thank you to the Short Hill Mall.  Because, let me tell you something.  This has been a disgrace.  You have your malls over there in the city.  Don't you got ghetto malls over here in Newark?  Don't be coming to our malls and doing something like that. 
[02:55:30]  You hear me?  Yeah, what else?  What else?  Yeah.  Okay, I mean, what is that, right?  Hello, sir.  Sir?  Mr. Sullivan? 
[02:56:00]  The sorriest thing is, right before I hit him, he goes,  What's that, a train?  Sir?  Did you hear that, shall we?  I heard it.  He goes, I heard it.  What's that, a train?  What's that, a train?  Wham!  Damn, that's funny.  Opie and Anthony, 1027.  Today, you're stuck with the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  And by the way, if you haven't tuned in the news, Khalid Muhammad got his cute little permit for his little million youth march. 
[02:56:30]  As the mayor likes to call it, the 6,000 youth march.  6,000?  There's not a million people.  That didn't show up.  It's about 6,000 people.  He's being kind.  I think there were a couple hundred last year.  Yeah.  Yeah, so when does it start?  11 o'clock, Saturday morning, on Malcolm X Boulevard.  I've been to Harlem, if you feel so inclined to show up.  Malcolm X Boulevard. 
[02:57:00]  Stay away, Whitey.  Stay away, Whitey.  Cracker alert.  Cracker alert.  No cracker zone.  It is a cracker-free afternoon on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem this Saturday.  When was the last time you were up there?  Who are you kidding me?  Who me?  It's been a cracker-free zone for many years.  I was just up there.  Let's see.  When was I up in Harlem?  Yeah, Rick makes a good point.  Friday.  Friday, on my way up to Massachusetts.  You were in?  Because I had to cut through Harlem. 
[02:57:30]  Oh.  How many red lights did you go through?  I don't pay attention to traffic signals up there.  Oh, no.  I don't pay attention to roads.  Yeah.  I will drive on the sidewalk.  Well, you can't.  I mean, I'm going up on the sidewalk at one point.  There's some woman who's like,  Whoa, my baby, look out for my stroller.  Crazy as hell.  I don't get a cracker.  And he's like, Whoa, look out.  You can't even tell where the roads are.  Oh, my God.  I had, like, the whole front of my grill was Colt 45 labels  from when I was just going through garbage pails and stuff.  Why? 
[02:58:00]  Why?  Rick makes a good point about the Million Youth March.  It's going to start at 11 a.m., and it's going to be done at 11.01.  Wow.  As soon as Khalid Muhammad opens his damn mouth.  And we must kill the man.  Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.  All right.  Everybody disperse.  What did he say last year?  He said grab the cops' guns and use them against them.  How is this guy getting another permit?  Right.  If somebody can say that, and then you wonder why cops shoot. 
[02:58:30]  This guy was telling people if the cops come in to break up the controlled riot, I guess,  I don't know what that was,  to grab their guns and use them against the cops.  Yeah.  What the?  How do you say that, and then the next year you're granted another permit?  Freedom of speech, Anthony.  Unbelievable.  Hallelujah.  Freedom of speech.  And Khalid's like, yeah, my brothers, yeah, rise up, rise up, grab the gun. 
[02:59:00]  Ooh, the cops are here.  Let me run out the back where I won't be seen for months.  The guy disappeared.  Oh, man.  Reverend Al's staying away, too?  Yeah.  He makes all the black leaders of the 60s and 70s really proud, doesn't he?  Oh, my God.  Khalid Muhammad?  Khalid Muhammad.  I don't know.  He won't.  Guess where I won't be Saturday.  Come on.  Malcolm X Boulevard? 
[02:59:30]  Yes, Malcolm X Boulevard.  All right, Vanjie.  We love Vanjie.  Oh, wait, I didn't go to Vanjie.  Hold on.  Vanjie, who lives in Harlem, on the line.  Vanjie, what's up?  Yeah, hi.  Hi, how you doing?  All right.  We haven't talked to each other in a long time.  Oh, you sound upset, Vanjie.  No, like, first of all, why are you talking about, like, we got country roads up here?  What, where did you go through?  No, it's not country roads.  I think you missed the point.  No.  Wait, wait, no.  I'll be completely honest with you. 
[03:00:00]  When a white person like myself, I'll speak for myself.  Go ahead, Opie.  When I'm driving through Harlem, I am scared S-less.  Why?  So what I do, and Anthony does it, too, we drive through red lights and get the hell  out.  Well, what do you say?  Because I don't understand it.  You know what?  There's part of the...  Let me fill you in.  There's part of the...  You know that white conspiracy?  What white conspiracy?  Well, there's a white conspiracy against black people, remember? 
[03:00:30]  Oh, yeah.  See, part of it is, we can run through red lights in black neighborhoods, and we just  wink at the cops, and they let us off the hook.  I'm sorry I had to fill you in on that one.  Oh, I didn't hear that.  But that's part of the white conspiracy.  Oh.  But what streets are you going through that you're so terrified?  You know, when I'm going, like, you know, back up to Boston to visit and stuff, I just  can never find that damn FDR, man.  I know.  What kind of business?  All of a sudden, I'm like on first ab or something.  I'm like, oh, there's got to be an exit for the FDR around here somewhere. 
[03:01:00]  Oh, no, I'm in the 100s.  Oh, no.  Listen, guys.  Oh, my God, that's 138th Street.  How'd I get up here?  Right.  Hey, this don't look like Midtown anymore.  Where are the people in the business suits?  Right.  But listen, the street...  Oh, the paranoia that goes through your head.  I'm just being honest with you, Angie.  I really don't know why, because you go from east to west on 125th Street.  It's all stores. 
[03:01:30]  You've got Starbucks, Pathmark, and all that stuff.  And it's nice, so I don't know why you should be terrified.  I don't see the stores, because the hour I drive past, all those big grates are down in  front of the windows and stuff, you know, because they pull down the big locked grates.  Yeah.  So, I don't know.  I swear, I was driving through there Friday.  It looked like a scene out of my video game Kingpin that I was playing.  Like, it just looked frightening.  You guys exaggerate.  Angie, but we're just being honest, I swear, there's not much of a bit here. 
[03:02:00]  This is what we do.  The funniest line is Anthony going, oh, my, that's 120th Street.  Oh, now I'm up in the 100th.  What happened?  Right.  Where's the bridge, for God's sake?  I've got to cross the bridge to safety.  Well, listen...  I need safety.  Next time, if you come up here, I'll escort you through.  Will you?  And you can walk through, and nobody will bother you.  I would like to try that.  But I'm telling you, I'm paranoid.  I mean, there's white people that live up here.  All the way up ringing, I don't care. 
[03:02:30]  What's that?  There's white people that live up here.  Oh, no, there's not.  Yes, there are.  Oh, you stop spreading that rumor.  Oh, come on.  For real.  You know that.  Yeah, they're called pimps.  Oh, my God.  No.  Wow.  You're crossing the line.  Isn't that terrible?  Oh, that was just a joke.  No, well, you know something?  I don't know much about Harlem, because any time I've been up there, it's been at night  when I'm driving to get to a bridge, and I don't really stop and look around.  Believe me, and I don't make any eye contact. 
[03:03:00]  And I leave about five car lengths in front of me, just in case I've got to make one of  them quick getaways.  Mm-hmm.  Just in case someone, you know, get out the core.  No.  You know?  I know, but it's not that bad.  Get out the core.  Well, there's a difference, though, because, I don't know, right?  I don't know.  It's bad.  In my mind, it's bad.  And I still got my stupid mask plates on, so it's just like, oh, brother, here it is.  Hey, I'm a mark.  Hi.  Hi, brother.  Yeah, no, I'm just down from Worcester, Massachusetts. 
[03:03:30]  I need directions to the, what's that?  Is that a firearm?  Listen, we're so uncivilized.  We've never seen a light.  Hey, look, I'm raising the roof.  I'm like you, homie.  Hey, we, can't we all just get a, put the knife away?  Could you put, please put it away?  Oh, man.  All right.  All, Scott, it's all stereotype.  We're just having fun, Vanjie.  I know, like yesterday, but with the Polish people today, it's such equal opportunity.  No, well, hey, well, no, let's look.  We did rag the Mexicans earlier in the hour. 
[03:04:00]  Oh, that's right, with the peppers and the men.  And the Hasidic Jews.  There were a couple jokes that came in for those folks there.  Oh, okay.  So, no.  Okay, because I was wondering when we were going to get our chance.  Take us up to Harlem one day and give us the tour.  I want to see the Apollo Theater.  I want to see, did I say the Apollo Theater?  Yeah.  Well, what else is up there?  If you're going to take us for, like, a drive in your neighborhood, would you mind if we did it in an armored tank?  Oh, ladies and gentlemen, we're now on Malcolm X Boulevard. 
[03:04:30]  If you look to the right, you'll see, uh, oh, look at that.  Well, gentlemen, if you reach under your seat, you'll find your Kevlar.  Put on your, uh, your vest and your helmet.  This is for your safety.  As we drag down Malcolm X Boulevard, you may hear whizzing next to your ears, which you might think is a mosquito or a fly.  These are actually small arms flyers that are going right past your head.  Do the tour buses really go up there?  No, yes, they really do, every day. 
[03:05:00]  Okay.  And, of course, we'll be disembarking from the bus to, uh, go on the attraction ride here.  It's a roller coaster we call Crack Hall Mountain.  Ladies and gentlemen, if you look to your right, there's Hoaggy Bear's Wild Ride.  We'll be leaving the bus and going into an authentic 70s-style pimp mobile.  Pink Cadillac.  You'll all get a complimentary hat with a big Worcester feather on it.  Thank you for taking the Harlem tour lines, where our motto is. 
[03:05:30]  It's Ike.  Know what I'm saying?  Uh, Mike, what's going on?  How you doing?  All right.  No, I just wanted to tell you guys, like, I'm a cop and I go home at night at midnight.  And I'm scared.  I got a gun on me.  I blow the lights, too.  He has a gun and he blows the red lights.  You blow all the lights, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Cops got to be pretty cool with that.  Like, if you see some guy blowing lights in a bad neighborhood and you pull him over or something,  it's got to be like, hey, you know, officer, come on. 
[03:06:00]  Look around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Help me out a little bit here.  There's a guy a little flack.  You know where he's coming from.  Come on.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  Well, you know, it is a small percentage of people, but I think the image that some of these  towns have, you know, a little scary.  Let's hear from Starks.  Starks.  Yo, what's up?  You're from Harlem?  No doubt.  Yeah.  Listen, y'all killing me over here, man.  I understand.  We're just being honest, though.  We get a little nervous when we drive through Harlem.  What do you want from us? 
[03:06:30]  Yo, I work in the projects, man.  Nothing but nice people in Harlem, you dig?  Yeah.  All right.  Nothing but nice people, man.  Well, help us out.  We'll listen to your side of it.  Has it changed?  I don't know.  I just...  You got to try driving through Harlem, all right?  It's like a different scene now.  It's not like back in the days, you hear stories.  Yeah.  Maybe that was true.  I don't know, but right now...  Maybe it's changed like Times Square's changed, you know?  There's no more sport in everything.  It's like Disney.  Maybe Harlem's like Disney.  Do you have a Disney store in the middle of Harlem?  Disney. 
[03:07:00]  Not really.  Well, we got Magic Johnson open of everything over there.  Magic Johnson with his movie theaters, right?  Yeah.  No.  Yeah.  Off, mark, uh...  I hear they have bulletproof screens at the movie theaters.  Yeah, you're killing me.  You're going to bust a few cats into the movie.  Hey, Starks.  Yeah?  How far do you have to go to get to a Popeye's fried chicken?  There's one up there somewhere.  Yeah, there is.  Yeah.  Well, what...  Popeye's, Kentucky, who do you want?  Well, Starks, what can you tell Whitey about Harlem?  That we don't know.  That we don't know.  Listen, y'all got more respect than a regular brother up there. 
[03:07:30]  Yeah.  Trust me, they ain't trying to make the neighborhood, uh...  Gotta get a bad...  A bad rap, you know?  Yeah.  Check it out.  I work with white boys all the time in Harlem.  They cool.  They can hang.  So we should just come up, visit and stuff?  Why not?  Check it out.  Bring plenty of cash.  You think we could do a live broadcast in the middle of Harlem?  Yeah, that would be fun.  Starbucks.  Starbucks.  You guys will walk by laughing at us.  Look at the white boys in Starbucks.  Yeah, right?  White boys... 
[03:08:00]  Well, I don't know why they put a Starbucks in Harlem.  I don't think they can afford it.  We have to be educated.  You know?  We're ignorant.  We are ignorant.  We gotta get up there and then take a look around,  because I'm just going off of what I heard  and what I see when I'm driving through very late at night,  and it's very scary.  Right.  Yeah, what's the deal with that cop?  Talking about he's scared.  Yes.  He can't get the hell out of Harlem, then.  He says he's scared when he drives home.  He has a gun.  He goes for the red lights, too.  Yeah, he's full of s***.  It's only going 150 if it gets some head. 
[03:08:30]  Starks, you got some chops to you, man.  We want to hang with you.  You call back any time.  All right, no problem, dude.  You're funny, though, man.  Yeah.  You guys suck.  All right.  Thanks, Starks.  All right.  Bye.  Starks trying to give us the other side of it.  See, we obviously, Opie,  we don't know anything about Harlem.  No, that's right.  We don't spend time up there.  How can we make any kind of a s***?  That's what we're pretty much proving here.  Rosa, very pissed off at us.  Rosa.  Yo.  Hey, what's up?  Well, I mean, I'm black. 
[03:09:00]  I'm from Harlem.  What's the deal?  And you're listening to our show?  Yeah.  Man, I think that's awesome.  Somebody got to listen to it.  So help us out.  We don't understand Harlem is what we're pretty much saying here today.  Yeah.  Why is it that you don't understand Harlem?  The people up there, they're just the skin as dark.  We're naive white boys.  We don't know about up there.  What is it that you don't know?  What do you want to know?  I don't know.  We get the image like a lot of people have,  that it's very scary,  and if you go up there,  something bad will happen to you.  Well, I was born and raised up there, 
[03:09:30]  and there's nothing going on up there.  People are trying to survive.  What do you think?  Yeah, but you're black.  So?  And you're white.  And you're a point.  So if we go up there,  it's like,  are we going to be looked at as victims?  Oh, please.  Somebody's going to look at you like a victim?  Are you walking up there with guns and stuff?  No.  You know, I don't know.  If I'm walking around,  and we just want to find the FDR,  that's all.  You don't know where the FDR is?  No.  Honest to God,  all of a sudden I'm in the hundreds,  and I'm getting really scared,  and I don't see a big sign for the FDR.  Well, I mean,  I can't see why y'all have a problem. 
[03:10:00]  I mean,  I know people live there who are white  and live in Harlem.  Well, you're shining some light  on the situation today.  You've got to go up there.  You've just got to be open-minded  and stop listening to the same old crap all the time.  All right, Rosa.  All right, guys.  Y'all be cool.  We're going to try to understand it.  That's all.  That's why we brought it up on the show.  Yeah, we've got to get up there, man.  All right.  You do.  You've got to, like,  do a broadcast from up there.  All right.  We'll do that.  All right.  All right, Rosa.  Bye.  Bye, Rosa.  Jay, what's up?  Hey, man.  What's happening?  Hey.  I can tell you guys.  I've been up here 14 years.  Yeah? 
[03:10:30]  They love the white boys.  The girls down there,  they know one thing.  Benefits.  You know?  They love your ass for that.  And the brothers down there,  they stay clear.  They don't know if you're 5-0 or not.  I'm really.  You can walk the streets, bro.  Yeah?  In and out of the buildings.  They don't do a thing to you.  You don't know.  And stocks, man.  Stocks, you're cool, bro.  But you're lying.  There ain't nobody working in the projects.  All right?  They use the same garbage  on the back of the truck  and ride around and around and around. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Oh, man.  See, this is the kind of stuff we hear.  So we don't know what the real deal is.  It's all right, though.  I have no problem going up there.  I'll go up there.  We'll work something out.  Ain't nobody going to bother you up there.  We're going to bring, like, a dat recorder  and we're going to record our day in Harlem.  That's it, man.  You want to be like the Blair Witch Project.  We'll find the tape years later.  Ain't nobody going to come here.  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that?  Who's that? 
[03:11:30]  Who's that?  All right, man.  Josh!  Josh!  Thank you.  Oh, good God.  Wow, that's funny, man.  It's a pile of crack pipes outside our tent.  What does it mean?  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry I came up here.  I'm sorry.  What is that?  Oh, my God. 
[03:12:00]  What's that sound?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Josh!  Oh, man.  I can't breathe.  What a mess.  All right. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Now, more of the worst of Opie and Anthony on FM Talk at 1027.  Fran is 84 years old, and she's a very interesting lady.  She wants to work at FM Talk at 1027.  Right, Fran?  Right.  I'd love to, because I'm a New Yorker. 
[03:13:00]  Uh-huh.  And I've had a career of 50 years playing the piano and singing and telling jokes at resorts.  But now that I'm old, nobody wants me anymore.  You're fat and ugly and stuff like that.  But radio was really good, because nobody could see me.  Do you tell dirty jokes?  Well, they're off-color.  I don't like to tell them, but I have multiple choices of what you want me to do.  Listen, you live 84 years, and you collect a lot of crap.  You've probably heard a few.  You know, and you have nowhere to talk about it, and I'm very thankful. 
[03:13:30]  Well, you guys called me and are giving me a chance to talk.  Yeah, but 23 skidoo.  This is kind of like an audition for the Opie and Anthony show, so I think we need some  of your best material, so I would go right for the penis jokes.  Well, does your penis burn when you urinate in the morning, some guy asked his friend,  and his friend said, I don't know.  I never tried colitis.  Wow.  You see, you know, I'm writing a dictionary, and I'm interested in definitions. 
[03:14:00]  Do you know what the definition of colitis is?  Colitis.  No, no idea.  The colitis is when a guy walks and his balls collide.  You like that?  Yeah.  I don't know if the censors want me to continue.  I wanted to ask you, how do you make a fruit cordial?  How do you make a fruit cordial?  Be nice to him.  That's one of those, you know, gay jokes. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah, how do you like this song?  Ta-ra-ra-boom-dee-ay, did you get yours today?  I got mine yesterday.  That's why I walk this way.  Boy, you must have really been a goer in your day, huh?  I would like to know if anybody would like to join my intercourse club.  No initiation, no fees, no dues.  Just come.  Opie, did you hear the one about the Russian lady who gave birth to a wooden baby? 
[03:15:00]  No.  She married a Poe.  All right, Brad, listen.  Hey, she's pretty funny, man.  You're killing him out there.  Oh, yeah?  You know what?  In the morning, what you may think of love is really a full bladder.  Do you have any other dirty jokes?  Well, I'm not all dirty.  I want to tell you about Clem and Mildred sitting on a porch in the Midwest.  And Mildred says, Clem, ain't the moon pretty tonight? 
[03:15:30]  And he says, yep.  She says, Clem, do you love me?  And he says, yep.  And she says, Clem, say something soft and mushy, Clem.  He says, bullsh**t.  Hold on, Brad.  You can't use the S word.  You can't use the B, S word.  I'm telling an 84-year-old lady that you can't say the B, S word on her show. 
[03:16:00]  Now, Fran, when was the last time you had sex?  I haven't had it for 25 years, and I'm very happy and healthy.  Yeah?  And I want to talk about that.  Would you like one?  Because love is a long and slender thing.  Love is a long and slender thing.  You made me love you.  You woke me up to do it.  All right, Fran, 84-year-old lady telling dirty jokes.  You want to play your little piano for a minute there?  Yeah.  All right. 
[03:16:30]  Any words?  You sure this isn't a tape from 1920?  Yeah.  It's like, hey, Spank, let's go to the fishing hole.  Okay, Alfalfa.  She's playing the piano.  This is radio, right?  She's just playing the piano.  Okay.  My dog shall like them king puffs. 
[03:17:00]  Okay.  Wow.  Look at that, Fran.  I play by ear.  I play a thousand songs and sing them.  You sure can tickle the old ivories, as they say.  Hey, can you shoot eggs out of your private area?  Oh, my God.  I'll be stopping.  What?  What happened?  You know, I thought you were clean, Puritan, nice boys.  Yeah.  We are.  Have you ever seen that trick, though?  No, I never saw the egg trick.  Oh, we're going to have to invite you down.  Hold on.  Someone wants to talk to you here. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, good.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, man.  This lady's a riot, man.  Yeah?  You've got to love her, huh?  Playing the goddamn piano.  All right.  Well, you want to say hi to Fran Scott?  Hey, what's up?  Hey.  Hello.  Oh, we've got a love connection.  Well, say something in algebra.  Hey, Fran, you think we could set you up with a banging?  Yes.  You're ruthless, man.  Listen, if they like me, tell me what time you want me to be on for about five minutes.  If anybody wants me, I'd be very happy to continue this. 
[03:18:00]  I'd be happy to read some books, read poetry, and, you know, if you want poetry or whatever,  I'd be very happy to continue on Doug N.E.W.  Look, I'm happy to have you in the studio.  Scott, hang up, all right?  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  Oh, I love everybody.  I can't give her the jackhammer.  What?  Fran, have you ever had the jackhammer?  No.  No.  I'm sorry.  Where do you boys come from? 
[03:18:30]  The sewer.  Oh.  Hey, do you have another dirty joke in you?  I love commercials.  Double your pleasure, double your fun.  Sleep with two women instead of just one.  She'll wonder where her fellow went when she tells him she is pregnant.  I don't know how much more dirty you want it, but I can't see.  That's all right.  All right, hold on.  There's a guy that wants to go out with you.  Bob, you have something to say to Fran?  Yeah, I'll bang the old coot for the trip to Hawaii.  Oh, my God, no. 
[03:19:00]  I don't want the trip to Hawaii.  All right, Fran, what do you say?  I don't want the trip to Hawaii.  I was already there, and it's very dull.  You let me bang you, and I'll win the trip to Hawaii.  No, I don't really need that.  Come on.  I'm 30 years old.  You might like it.  I have mental stimulation, and I have a boyfriend that's 13 years younger than I.  You've got a spry one.  What?  You've got a spry one.  I don't need.  Listen, I know.  You haven't had it in 25 years, Fran. 
[03:19:30]  I know you weren't.  You're probably a little backed up.  I know you weren't made with a finger.  I've got a few fingers for you.  No, I would.  Bob, you're disgusting, man.  Come on, Fran, a little bit of you and me.  You mean people, your audience are so young that they still want to know all about sex  and stuff like that?  Oh, yeah.  If I can't get wisdom from an old lady like me, then you're sure to be ashamed of yourself.  Hey, Fran, I don't want the wisdom.  I just want the booty so I can get the trip.  What are you going to do?  You know, that would win the trip.  If Bob banged an 84-year-old friend, I don't think anyone would beat Bob. 
[03:20:00]  Come on, Fran, you'll be doing me a favor.  I've never been to Hawaii.  Listen, I'll sing you a Hawaiian song.  It is so broad, couldn't get wet in the rainforest, okay?  What are you going to do, Bob?  She's got a fish.  You're going to have to dip her in Saudi Arabia to get her lubed up enough.  Oh, Fran's singing again.  Bob, what a mess this is.  How many people are on this wire?  Wire.  Wire. 
[03:20:30]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.  All right, Fran, you're still on the line with Bob who wants to bang you.  Come on, Fran, let's do it.  All right, listen.  All right, you want it?  All right, let's go.  Seriously, let's do it.  I'm for it.  I'll get the trip.  You get banged.  Everyone's happy.  I weigh 225 pounds.  I weigh 210, so I'm on top.  Oh, wow.  What do you look like?  I look a little bit across between Emilio Estevez and I got a shower after this show today, man. 
[03:21:00]  Hey, you want to leave us with one last dirty joke?  How you make Manischewitz wine.  Yeah, how do you make that?  You kick him in the balls.  How about...  How about...  I'm so wrong, man.  It is.  How...  You got one more one?  How about the guy...  Do you know about the guy who married a shoplifter? 
[03:21:30]  No.  He liked to watch us snatch.  Oh, my Lord.  Wow.  Bill, what's going on?  You know, what's her last name, Marlon?  You got your little Jackie now.  What?  You want another one? 
[03:22:00]  Sure.  Sure.  The guy says, is that Dick Brown?  No, he was out in the sun too long.  She's out of control, man.  You got to have her in.  You got to give her a little corner in the back of the studio.  All right.  Bill, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  All right, bye.  Holy smokes.  Well, what's the verdict?  I'm sorry.  We love you.  Really?  We absolutely love you.  We're going to get a limo for you to bring you down to the show in the very near future.  Rick, what's going on?  Hey, yo, what's up? 
[03:22:30]  Hey.  I'll f*** the old lady for the trip.  All right.  Right in the studio.  What's up?  No joke.  All right, listen.  They're dumping out of our show like crazy.  Rick, you cannot have oral sex with Fran.  I'm sorry.  Oh, ask her.  No, anal is okay.  That's what she's eating as long as she's cracking jokes.  Get a rim shot, will you?  We got the rim shot.  Oh, my God. 
[03:23:00]  I find that.  This is debauchery mania.  This is debauchery mania.  I find that.  I find that.  What the hell?  We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin.  I'm Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  We continue coverage now of the search for Bernie Getz Squirrel.  Obviously, a very distraught Bernie Getz Squirrel's been missing since early Friday morning. 
[03:23:30]  The search continuing as the search continues as the Navy ship, the grass looks at the waters for Bernie's squirrel.  We're not sure if this was a flying squirrel, but they are looking for wreckage.  We will speak later with a very distraught bullwinkle who will give some insight on the life and times of Bernie Getz's squirrel. 
[03:24:00]  Of course, a squirrel coming from a family plagued by tragedy over the years.  You may remember this squirrel's father shot in the head in the park by a little kid with a BB gun.  That horrible, horrible episode caught on videotape where you see his head go back and to the left.  And the mommy squirrel, covered with brains, bravely goes on. 
[03:24:30]  Here you're seeing footage now of Bernie's squirrel, very young, saluting that boulder squirrel.  The search now continuing.  Our helicopter is circling above looking for Bernie's squirrel.  Well, the family, of course, consoling themselves with the squirrel compound.  We cannot find a squirrel.  And, boy, the teeth look a lot like the Kennedy family.  They don't have those big, big choppers they have. 
[03:25:00]  Of course, Bill Clinton saying they're giving all resources to find the squirrel a treasure to Bernie Gale.  Well, Tom, you sound a little woozy once again.  A little groggy, yeah.  Well, I was out looking for the squirrel myself, and another squirrel was in a tree, and I threw a big, big nut down on my head.  It hit just right on my temple.  I'm a bit groggy.  Tom Brogan, everybody's free nightly news.  And, of course, tragic loss. 
[03:25:30]  Everybody leaving flowers and nuts at the Getz house as a tribute.  As time runs out, I've had the Coast Guard on the phone, and they are saying this is now a search for victims and no longer a rescue.  I just want to let you know that the search is costing millions of dollars now.  The squirrel did not file a flight plan. 
[03:26:00]  We have talked with other squirrels that said they would not have even climbed a tree in the haze of Friday morning.  Very difficult.  Bernie's squirrel missing now for quite a few days as hope runs out at the squirrel compound.  Now, you see, the patriarch of the squirrel family, that big, fat one,  you might remember, made the news years back as he came calling out of a river after a female squirrel that was accompanying him drown 
[03:26:30]  under mysterious...  With the search continuing, we will keep breaking into your programming.  The search for Bernie Gesson's squirrel.  Squirrel Junior.  On this NBC Nightly News, still broadcasting from Yellowstone National Park, of course,  looking for the picnic basket scandal. 
[03:27:00]  That is Plague Yogi Bear, as Ranger Smith is always trying to turn him and blame him for picnic.  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, Scooby-Doo, McGill-Gerrilla, and Ricochet Rabbit have gathered together holding a candlelight vigil.  We will keep you updated on events looking for Bernie Gesson's squirrel. 
[03:27:30]  Like I said, the Coast Guard is searching for victims now.  And we will cover the funeral of Bernie Gesson's squirrel, who will be buried at sea after being cremated.  This just in, Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News.  The body of Bernie Gesson's squirrel has been found.  It's a tragic day.  We'll be going to the squirrel compound and getting a reaction from the squirrel compound. 
[03:28:00]  Tom Brokaw, NBC Nightly News, will be tying up traffic and interrupting your favorite programs to bring you continuous coverage of a lost and now dead rodent.  You deserve the best, but that'd be a lot of work.  Here's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  On FM Talk at 1027.  Talking about steel reserve high-gravity lager. 
[03:28:30]  Well, there's a problem.  In the community!  As Reverend Al so eloquently puts it, that this steel reserve high-gravity lager,  the ads are, uh, racist.  They show two tortoises having sex.  And that's racist?  And it says, uh, research shows sex sells.  Well, I guess it's racist putting such distasteful ads in, uh, only certain neighborhoods,  because they were saying you don't see these ads on Park Avenue. 
[03:29:00]  It's all about supply and demand.  Yeah.  And I guess there's a demand for, uh, for this stuff in the community.  All right, so this is the beer everyone's talking about, the high-gravity steel reserve.  Can I have one?  That was funny.  Remember what I said, uh, earlier in the show?  I said, is Budweiser available in, uh, some of the communities that only handle steel reserve,  like Harlem?  Mm-hmm.  And somebody said, yeah, but it's an import.  Oh, it's only available as an import.  All right.  All right, here we go.  Let me, let me crack open. 
[03:29:30]  Wait.  Oh.  Eight.  With a fine twist off top.  Eight point one proof.  Whoa!  No, it's got eight point one percent alcohol.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  First of all.  12 fluid ounces.  Nice and cold.  Wait a minute.  First of all, this, this color is a little off.  Doesn't it look like a urine specimen?  Oh, wait a minute.  I seem to have given you the wrong jar.  I've been watching some, uh, in living color, uh.  All right.  High-gravity steel reserve. 
[03:30:00]  Let's take a swig.  Wow.  That's disgusting.  Woo!  Goddamn!  We're goddamn!  Now, that's good stuff.  All of a sudden, you start talking black when you drink this.  No, wait a minute.  Hey, this stuff is potent.  Holy smoke.  Ow, man.  What the?  It's strong.  This is strong.  Yeah, it's strong.  Mm.  It's stronger when it's warm.  Oh, I bet.  I don't like it. 
[03:30:30]  Do you like it, Ed?  Uh, it's not, it's not awful bad, like, like Meisterbrow or something.  No.  This is like the other side of the spectrum.  I don't know.  I drink this, uh, in the cold on a street corner or something.  Maybe that's why it's got more alcohol in it.  No, I'm serious.  Maybe after you've already had six or five.  But if I was at home and I was enjoying an after-dinner brew, this wouldn't be the one I'd go for.  I am outraged.  Oh, no. 
[03:31:00]  I am outraged.  Reverend Howard.  I am outraged.  What the hell are you doing in the studio?  I see you drinking the Steel Reserve high-gravity lock.  Well, we want to try it.  There's a lot of controversy about this stuff, so.  This is a plot, a conspiracy by the white man.  Why is that?  8.1% alcohol.  Yeah.  Well, obviously, they want the homeless to drink this, so when they die on the streets,  they're already in bombs. 
[03:31:30]  You got an extra bottle.  Hey, this stuff's pretty good.  You can have mine.  All right.  Wow.  Steel Reserve.  No, that's just not happening for me at all.  Hey, leave the music on.  It's kind of a soundtrack.  I like it.  All right.  But Doug has brought us something else here, too, to try out.  Oh, yeah.  What Steel Reserve?  Boy, I drank two sips, and I'm tanked.  It went right to my head, but.  All right.  What else did you bring?  He brought, wow, a black and tan beer called Howling Monkey. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, come on.  Look at the label.  Where's my?  Where?  All right.  Where's my Howling Monkey?  Dude, look at the label.  Let me see the label.  It's a monkey in a suit.  It is.  It's Planet of the Game.  My God.  The label is adorned with the image of Dr. Zaius.  Damn you.  Damn.  Let me partake in some of this Howling Monkey. 
[03:32:30]  Damn, it's not bad.  My God.  The image of Dr. Zaius staring back at me.  Damn you all to hell.  I can't be drinking Howling Monkey.  But I'm strangely drawn to it.  Drawn to the Howling Monkey.  As I was drawn to Zeri.  Lovely Zira.  Cornelius never knows.  He will never know what happened between me and Zira. 
[03:33:00]  We drank a case of Howling Monkey.  And then I turned her into a Howling Monkey.  Yes.  I dropped my loincloth.  She saw the man with no hair on his body.  I gave her some of Jarton's meat.  Yes.  I partook in monkey meat while drinking.  Howling Monkey.  Damn me.  To hell.  Damn.  I like the Howling Monkey. 
[03:33:30]  Well, is it better than the Steel Reserve?  What's the alcohol content on me?  All right.  Shut this music.  Give me Reverend Owls and I'll go back to the Steel Reserve.  All right.  We need a little more Steel Reserve.  Wait a minute.  Give that to me.  All right.  All right.  Here's Steel Reserve.  Mm.  Ah.  Yep.  Yep.  Steel Reserve definitely stronger.  Got a stronger taste to it. 
[03:34:00]  Wow.  That's gross.  The Howling Monkey.  You don't like it?  You don't like the Howling Monkey?  No.  That's a better one.  Now, is this sold in the black community, too?  Is this in the community?  This was around here.  We could get this around here.  Oh, it is?  It's not a thing to source.  All right.  Damn.  I don't know.  Well, the Steel Reserve will get you snotty.  I'll give you that.  I'll give you that.  Let me tell you.  If I was impoverished and had a lot of problems and had to worry about crime and shootings  in my community and raising my children and sending them to a school where they might 
[03:34:30]  be shot or stabbed, I would drink the Steel Reserve.  I think that's an endorsement for the Steel Reserve.  Joe, man.  Slot if he's an appalled, he drinks out on the job.  Steel Reserve.  It's I.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  And then.  What a douchebag.  Green recreation. 
[03:35:00]  Stan Goldberg.  This is sicker than faces of death.  One, two, seven.  Green. </pre>
