<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts complaining bitterly about their perpetually broken studio equipment, specifically their computers. They described a seemingly endless cycle of replacements, each as faulty as the last, comparing their situation to a disastrous game of Sim City.  Their frustration extended to their employer, criticizing the apparent lack of concern regarding their working conditions and highlighting the perceived incompetence of their staff, particularly Executive Producer Travis, who took vacation time while other staff members came in for no show. Gary, a manager, was blamed for this situation.  The conversation then shifted to Sam’s recent Hawaiian honeymoon, which he detailed in surprisingly meticulous fashion, recounting his surprisingly comfortable coach seats on an 11-hour flight (despite opting out of a cheap business class upgrade), his island-hopping between Maui and Kauai, and his deliberate avoidance of typical tourist activities and expensive meals.  He detailed his frugal approach, using Walmart snacks and cheap desserts, even expressing an internal conflict (described as an OCD issue) over his dislike of fish despite being in Hawaii.  The hosts reacted with a mixture of amusement and exasperation, teasing him relentlessly about his penny-pinching.  The cost of the trip (approximately $6,500-$7,000), his limited and heavily filtered honeymoon photos, and speculation about his wife Jess's reaction to his frugality were also discussed. The segment ended with renewed complaints about their equipment and management.

Next, the show launched into a heated debate about fantasy football. Opie and Anthony, using homophobic slurs and other derogatory terms, vehemently denounced the game and its participants.  They compared it unfavorably to traditional gambling.  The segment included listener calls, some defending fantasy football, others agreeing with the hosts' contempt. Callers detailed their league experiences, including elaborate team names, draft parties, and financial stakes (one caller mentioning a $1,000 win).  The hosts’ frustration was significantly amplified by the repeated failure of the interns (including “Puppet Hair” and another unnamed intern) to screen out calls from fantasy football supporters, leading to a heated exchange with the interns and production staff, including Sal and E-Rock.

Following this, a dispute concerning intern management erupted.  E-Rock's seemingly contradictory statements regarding his supposed resignation from his unpaid intern supervisory role before vacation were at the heart of the conflict.  Troy's temporary takeover added to the confusion and the ensuing on-air argument involved Sal, the absent Travis, and the “Radio Wizard.” The hosts questioned E-Rock's dedication and communication skills, and he eventually agreed to formally relinquish his role, with Sam volunteering to inform management.  This segment also featured humorous comparisons of Troy's hair to Hitler's.  Jim Florentine, a guest in studio, promoted his comedy CD, "Awful Jokes from My First Comedy Notebook," performing some of his early jokes and a cringe-worthy MTV audition script.  Actor Jeffrey Rush then joined to promote "The Eye of the Storm," discussing his career, including his Oscars for "Shine" and his nomination for "The King's Speech,"  his experiences with typecasting, and the challenges of acting.

The show continued with a conversation about Geoffrey Rush's role in *Pirates of the Caribbean*, his time as Mel Gibson's roommate, and the nature of acting.  Jim Florentine's CD was again briefly promoted.  The main focus then shifted to an in-studio appearance by Rob Thomas and Kyle Cook of Matchbox Twenty, promoting their new album "North."  This lengthy interview covered their career, including early struggles and the success of "Push," the evolution of radio, their songwriting process, challenges of old music videos, early MTV memories, and the dynamics of band collaboration.  Anthony's allergic reaction to hair dye was also detailed during this portion.

The Matchbox Twenty interview continued into the next segment, focusing on the collaboration vs. solo artist debate, with Rob Thomas recounting a dramatic incident during the recording of Mad Season where a band member quit and then returned. A brief commercial break for Dish Network preceded a performance of Matchbox Twenty's "She's So Mean." The remainder of the show became chaotic, including a recap of Jim Florentine's appearance, Anthony's hair dye mishap, the unresolved E-Rock/management conflict, and the interns' continued failure to screen calls properly, with interns "Number Two" and "Gio" specifically mentioned. The show ended abruptly amidst this escalating intern-related turmoil.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  My laptop, my power supply's dead.  That's a brand new computer right there, isn't it?  You can't get on the network.  I don't know what's going on here.  Sam's comb is attached to his computer.  It's also not functioning.  Yeah, he's got the big pro.  Yeah, he's raging.  You decided to take the ponytail out, yeah.  That's good.  Is that a new computer there, Sam?  Yeah, I mean, it's new in the sense that it's newer than the last one we complained about.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How old is that computer? 
[00:00:30]  Can we get a new computer?  I think this is the new computer.  Is it really?  Yeah.  It takes five minutes to load Google.  Oh, that's good.  Like Google.com with the word Google on the page.  Uh-huh.  And then the search bar, and that's the page.  How old is that?  I mean, in the sense of how long have we had it, or when was it made?  Well, both.  I don't know when it was made.  Why can't we have a new computer?  It's like a good one.  They don't buy new things.  I gave up on the corporate computers years ago.  I just used my fucking cell phone. 
[00:01:00]  My cell phone is way more powerful than the dumb computer in studio.  You know what it is?  There's a bunch of broken things around this place.  A bunch of broken computers, broken things.  Right, right.  And they just rotate around.  Yeah.  Like, they'll take your broken thing out, give you someone else's broken thing, because it's  broken differently.  Right.  And you don't notice what's broken on it for maybe a couple of days, and then they ship  yours off to some other studio.  Can I explain?  We're living Sim City with no one at the controls.  Yeah, yeah.  This is a social experiment.  If there's a fire or something like that, it just burns. 
[00:01:30]  We still got our ATVs, but you know when those break down, they're not going to be replaced.  Yeah.  No, well, what are you going to do?  And then I finally got everything working.  Yeah.  But somehow in the time from when I left to when I got back, my computer's been locked.  Nobody's touched it.  Right.  But it's lost communication with the printer altogether.  So it's got to be completely reset.  It's not even talking to the printer.  No.  So how old is that computer?  This one down here?  Yeah.  Danny's looking it up.  I mean, we have to look it up.  It's a 486. 
[00:02:00]  That's old.  You got to look it up.  That's old.  We've had it for probably less than a year in here.  Oh, really?  That's not what it is.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  So when we asked for a new computer and they finally said, okay, they actually got an old  computer and put it in here.  That's what we're trying to find out.  Those sons of bitches.  I thought for a second that this was actually a good computer, but then I checked the system  specs and it's a different computer.  Yeah.  So I thought this was the Dell Optiplex with the four gigs of RAM.  Why would it be? 
[00:02:30]  Because we all know Dell is happening these days.  But then I checked the system properties and it's, yeah, it's not as good.  Oh, it's not quite as good.  But how old is it?  Well, it doesn't seem to be too old, but we are running the very latest service pack of  Windows XP.  So that's good, right?  Oh, yeah.  You can tell because it says version 2002.  Oh, yeah.  Cool.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  That's good.  That's only 10 years old, right?  XP.  Yeah.  And then they're like, they told us, don't worry. 
[00:03:00]  We're going to be upgrading all your software.  Could someone just answer this question?  It could be a question for Twitter today, I guess.  Why don't they give a shit about us?  I just need to know.  Have we dropped off?  No.  I don't think so.  Is it time to admit we dropped off and that's why they don't give a shit about us?  No, that's the way it is.  Why are we running software from 2002?  Well, XP is one of the most stable Windows platforms they made and it just actually got  bypassed as the most prominent OS on computers by Windows 7 now. 
[00:03:30]  Is that good?  Which just skirted them out with maybe 42.6% of the M.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Mac is still small.  Like when you look at it, even though it's the biggest company in the world, Safari is  not even close to this, is it?  As far as OS goes, Windows has over 90%.  I'm back to being a Windows man.  Are they still over 90%?  Windows man?  You're a Windows man.  I went to Mac and I tried that out for a bit.  I went through a couple of Macs and I said, this is shit. 
[00:04:00]  And I said, fuck this.  So I had, I guess maybe I just had shitty Macs.  I don't know.  Maybe I had shitty Macs.  I hate Windows, dude.  I wish I could go back to it.  I hate it.  Like every time I use it, it's like, boonk, boonk.  What's that noise?  That is a little USB noise.  Yeah, they revamped it for Windows 7.  The noise?  I fucking, you know what I hate about the motherfucking Windows?  How about the goddamn drivers constantly with your fucking drivers?  Oh, Windows does not identify this thing you just plugged in. 
[00:04:30]  You need the drivers.  Update drivers.  Pain in the ass with the drivers.  At least when something takes a shit on my Windows machine, I could fix it, though.  That's kind of nice.  Like when something, like I had a big problem over the break and, you know, I could just  go in, I could troubleshoot, I could figure out what's wrong and fix it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Can't do that on a Mac.  It's like, well, fuck it.  I guess I either bring it to the store or buy a new one.  Gotta go to the store.  Yeah, buy a new one.  And, well, see, now I got my nice Sony VAIO here with a dead power supply.  It doesn't work without power.  Well, you know, you could probably pick one up for about 20 bucks if it was an Apple. 
[00:05:00]  Oh, well.  If it was like a MacBook, you'd be spending like $70 on a new charger.  Yeah.  Well, all right, well.  Go Windows.  We'll make do, though, you know what I mean?  Yeah, well, we've been making do for a while.  Oh, I'm going to go make do right now.  Not that kind.  We're going to push forward and put on great shows regardless.  Of course we are.  Of course we are.  We don't need these newfangled computers.  Basically, you're saying forging ahead.  That's right.  Forging ahead.  Exactly.  We should come up with a wish list today. 
[00:05:30]  I have an answer for your question, by the way.  Which one?  I'm sure I'd be in bed.  Why have they not treated us?  It's a combination of our apathy and their incompetence.  Goes hand in hand.  Apathy and no confidence in the morning.  Pew, pew, pew.  So I guess we're back from a little respite.  A little vacation-ish thingy-ish.  Why is Sam laughing?  What happened?  I don't know. 
[00:06:00]  Something just tickled me.  Tickled you.  What do you mean some of us are back?  Who's missing?  I guess we're all here.  Travis is away.  Is anybody else gone or no?  No, it's just Travis.  Cool.  What's happening?  Something.  No, I don't know.  I see the smirk.  What's happening?  No, because I knew that that statement would make for uncomfortable moments.  You know how I smile when there are uncomfortable moments.  Right, that's true.  Well, he's the executive producer, and he's taking some time off. 
[00:06:30]  What's wrong with that?  It's good.  I'll say this in fairness.  We're a hard show to work for because we don't have predictable days off.  Like, that's something that is...  And we make that kind of hard on the staff because we don't tell them...  We sometimes don't know until the last minute when we're going to be off.  All right.  But it is what it is.  Which is what?  No.  Just us.  Just us drifting about. 
[00:07:00]  Just us drifting around.  Yeah.  We're like fucking...  Well, the guy's worked last week.  No.  Why are you laughing, Sam?  Someone's saying...  Yeah, we're all floating around.  You know who we're like...  We're like fucking...  What's his name?  Who was an orca?  Who was an orca?  George C. Scott?  No.  What's his name?  I thought that was a good guess.  Peter something.  It actually is.  Who is the guy?  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Richard Harris.  Richard Harris. 
[00:07:30]  This show is like Richard Harris at the end of that movie just floating around on a piece of ice.  That's what it feels like.  We're just floating around.  Nice.  That's good, right?  Trying not to...  And I'm so happy.  I almost said trying not to let E-Rock knock us at the door.  Oh, E-Rock.  I'm overtired.  I've been up for two days.  C-Rock's just sitting there.  He was waiting for it, so he gets the anticipation.  Well, he's happy we got it out of the way early.  Now, Sam, why are you smirking at the fact that I said you guys worked last week, or some of you did? 
[00:08:00]  The system is broken.  What?  The system is broken.  What system?  Do you mean the political system?  I don't know.  There's something broken here, because why would people work when the show's off and not work when the show's on?  Why would the system be set up where that would be something that ever happens?  Yes.  Look, I don't fault any of the guys.  If I was you guys, I would do the exact same thing.  I blame the people that might be supervising the situation. 
[00:08:30]  They're the dummies.  The system used to be great, as a matter of fact.  How was it?  Hold on.  I got to say, they are the dummies.  Because in their minds, that makes sense.  To have the whole staff work when O.P., Anthony, and Jim Norton are out.  And I'm not blaming Danny or anyone.  I swear to you, I would do the same thing.  But it just logically doesn't make sense.  Back at XM, it was like, all right, well, if there's a show, you show up for work, and you do it.  And if there's no show, as long as you don't, as long as you have nothing to do, 
[00:09:00]  like, you know, obviously some staff people have things to do even if there's no show.  But as long as you had nothing to do, you were fine.  And that system worked very well until about 2009, I guess.  And then what happened?  And then the rules changed.  Why would the rules change?  Everything got better.  Look, I don't blame anyone for coming in last week and doing absolutely nothing.  Because there's nothing really to do.  No, no, those are the best.  Maybe some busy work.  Those are the best.  During, during... 
[00:09:30]  What did you do last week, Danny?  Be totally honest.  I was working really hard for this company.  Jesus.  You were here, but what could you have possibly been doing?  Research.  Oh, R&D.  Yeah, you know, you got to figure out what the next big bit is and all that stuff.  I was bummed out that I had to take my honeymoon on the free days instead of the show days.  Oh, man.  See, these guys get free days and show days.  I remember, right...  Why are you laughing, Sam?  Why is the system broke?  It just doesn't make any sense there.  Obviously, it's just...  What would any of a...  Everybody has to be aware.  The staff coming in and spending a whole day when there's no show, like once, or like 
[00:10:00]  if there's something going on.  Every once in a while, maybe.  Like if we're doing a live gig, and you guys are taking off the Thursday before a Friday,  and we meet on the Thursday to figure everything out.  But doing it for three days last week doesn't make sense.  During the last week of August?  Right.  There's nothing going on anyway, let alone if there's no show.  Oh, my God.  That just shows how stupid Gary is.  He's a dummy.  Why would he allow that?  And like I said, Danny, I'm not faulting you. 
[00:10:30]  I swear to you.  What's the fault?  I would do the exact same fucking thing.  Our executive producers should be here when we're here.  I think that's fair.  I don't think that's an unfair thing to say, but at the same time, I think that the situation  that we've been put in makes it...  Yeah, because it makes it so that these are the situations that you're left with.  But he's going to take him the days left.  No, but again, I understand we're hard because we don't schedule in advance, and it does make  it hard, and I get that.  Yeah, and we have to...  In order for us...  I can't imagine, like, there was something to do last week.  Like, for the radio show, I can't even imagine what could possibly have been done. 
[00:11:00]  I don't know.  But the first week back in September, this is like when it all starts back up.  This is like, last week of August, I understand we probably should have said, yeah, we're going  to be taking it out, even though we...  I didn't even know until the day of.  I said, we're taking it.  I had no idea.  Well, that's the other problem.  We didn't have any vacation days left, and then they finally, like, did the right thing.  Yeah, and we can't exactly just take off, you know, willy-nilly.  Like, our vacation has to be approved way in advance, so...  But if we take off, like, three days like that, and the exec producer doesn't come in, 
[00:11:30]  that's understandable, and then he should be here when we're here because we do need him.  I mean, it's like, that's an issue.  We're on the air.  We need him.  I mean, I'd say we keep her helpless without him, but we...  I mean, it's something...  Yeah, I hear you, and it would be great if it did work like that, but unfortunately,  it doesn't because Travis would have never been able to take those days on such short  notice.  If he said, hey, I want to take these vacation days for the last three days last week, they  would have been like, oh, sorry.  I mean, it probably would have got pushed through in the long run, but it would have been like,  oh, you really need to get these in, you know, for three or four weeks at minimum. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, my God.  And early on, look, you know, early during the transition here, I remember there was  a day where we didn't have a show, and I just didn't come in because that's what I was kind  of used to.  I think I was moving, I think, and it was great because I was like, oh, now I get to  go to Staples and fucking pick up boxes and shit, and sure enough, I got the fucking phone  call, and I got a big talking to.  But what did they want you to do last week?  Well, plus, I still don't understand.  Can I tell you what the trick is? 
[00:12:30]  I wasn't here, obviously, but if it worked out the way it usually worked out, most of  the guys still come in at like 5 o'clock in the morning, and so they just get to sit  here because there's nobody here until like 8 or 9.  I'm not going to waste my time and rush hour traffic coming in at a regular man's day from  9 o'clock in the morning.  Fuck that.  Not only is there no show, and not only is it the last week of August, but it's 5 o'clock  in the morning, I'm still getting up at 3.15 a.m.  So, what did they want you guys to do last week? 
[00:13:00]  Make radio.  Make a, make, they want us to make a reservoir of radio.  Oh.  So that when you guys get here.  We have something to take a dip in.  Yeah, you could just turn the faucet on and radio pours out.  So you guys were here Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday just doing busy work.  Well, we're making sure that the news got recorded.  What did you do last week?  Right.  I made sure that all of the big stories were remembered for you.  Right.  The big stories.  Don't forget about the stories. 
[00:13:30]  Gary is as dumb as they come for allowing this.  No offense.  The only thing that would be.  No offense.  Well, because I don't want, I don't want, because I don't want, I'm not mad at Danny or  anyone else.  The system, like you said, Sam, is broke.  We play the game that, uh, that has been, has been given to us with the rules clearly defined.  And then logically, like Jimmy said, summer's over.  This is fall.  Like radio and everything we're, we're all about starts up today and, and Travis is out.  And it's like, I, I know that like if he, even if he planned for that, like I understand 
[00:14:00]  this is where the company would be dumb.  Like, why would they make you guys give notice if we were a last minute show and that's annoying  for you guys?  I'm sure it is.  And I know it is, but why wouldn't they let you guys take those three days?  Yeah.  Because we are employees of the company.  We are not, uh, we are not employed by the Opie and Anthony show.  We are not contractors.  Right.  We are employees of this company and we, and we get no special treatment.  Why should we have a special treatment when other, you know, people that work for other  shows don't get treatment like that?  We are employees of Sirius XM. 
[00:14:30]  We have nothing to do with you guys.  But why would he plan to take the first week of September anyway?  Like, why not?  Like, I understand not knowing what we were doing last week, but why plan the first week  of September when you know that we're back or you know that the, you just have  days, I mean, you know, you have days off to take, so you take them.  I mean, when, when, when would any day be good for him between now and the end of the  year, aside from like Christmas or Thanksgiving?  Yeah.  Around then, I mean.  Well, yeah, but you know what?  He's, even if he takes Thanksgiving and Christmas, he still has days left over.  So this company doesn't pay out your days if you don't take them. 
[00:15:00]  Which is a mistake, by the way, by the company.  It encourages people to do shit like this.  It's, it's nice, it's nice that now, you know, uh, because some of us have been here  for an extended period of time, some of us have extra vacation days as a, as a reward.  So now, you know, to exercise that reward, you get shit for it because, oh, you shouldn't  have taken the days or whatever.  So you can never win.  Can you picture though, like other shows without their executive producer?  Like, and that's, that this, taking this kind of shit is kind of what comes with that  position.  I mean, it's like, I know, even though I know that they haven't given him what he wants 
[00:15:30]  either, but.  Like, we used to not ever, we used to never deal with vacation days or sick days or forms.  The, the, it's just, if there was a show, there was work.  If there was no show, you didn't have, as long as you didn't have anything.  That, it worked fine for a really long time.  Yeah.  And so they started putting in all the corporate rules and regulations in place.  And then, and then you get this.  So, I mean, no one, it's not like we prefer this.  It's not, I don't think Travis prefers it or anybody prefers it, but that's what they've  given us to work with.  So that's what, you know, that's, that's how it works.  But to plan for the first week of September when you know we're not going to, you know 
[00:16:00]  we're here.  Right.  Well, that's.  Doesn't make sense.  That's Gary's responsibility.  He should understand all that and try to figure it out.  I get all the, there's a lot of moving parts here.  Yeah.  But then in the end, the guy that supposedly was hired to kind of supervise this channel  should be on top of it and figuring out a solution to this.  Period.  I blame Gary.  Again.  There's a reason vacation days are approved, right?  Uh-huh.  There's a reason somebody has to approve vacation days.  Sure.  I mean. 
[00:16:30]  And the company's dumb for not allowing people to carry them over or paying them out.  It's like, because that just encourages shit like this.  Because if I had to take days, I would absolutely take them.  Mm-hmm.  I know I would.  If I had to, I would take them.  But.  Yeah.  Again.  In that position, it's different.  But, I mean, what is being said loud and clear today is that Gary thinks the show is  fine without an executive producer the first week back after the summer.  It's good to go.  Good to go.  Good to go.  Good to go.  We push forward.  Yeah.  Everyone knows, you know, kind of August is one of those weird months and no one gives 
[00:17:00]  a fuck about it.  But September, you come back strong.  And here we are, coming back strong.  I mean, everybody.  I'm just curious, though.  I'm just curious.  Like, everybody did get the email from Travis that stated that he wasn't going to be here.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, I understand.  I'm not blaming him either.  I think his planning was poor.  And I would believe you.  Everything I'm saying, I would say if he was standing right here.  Sure, I don't doubt that.  I would absolutely say that.  But his planning was poor for this one, unless there was a family emergency or a birth or  something. 
[00:17:30]  But it's like, we're just coming back.  You got to, as the executive producer, you got to, I mean, you're here.  Well, he's not the executive producer.  Well, he's in that position.  I mean.  Is he?  Kind of, yeah.  Of course he is.  Well, then they should respect him as such.  Maybe so.  But, you know, with the executive being, I mean, I'm not going to argue against Travis when  he's not here in that capacity.  I'm not going to do that.  If there's anything I have to say to him about that, I'll say it when he's standing right  here, because he's not here to defend himself.  Well, I just know that if he handed me his business card, it wouldn't say executive producer  on it.  Okay.  I'm not trashing the guy. 
[00:18:00]  Fair enough.  He's not executive producer.  Let's move forward.  I mean, look.  Fair enough.  That's what the company, the company wants to treat him like it, but they don't want  to acknowledge it.  So, that's the situation.  Well, do they really acknowledge anything financially?  I mean, let's be honest.  They don't acknowledge anything anytime, really.  Unless it's bad.  If you did something bad, they'll absolutely acknowledge it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Illustrated in that flow chart, right?  Yes.  Let me see.  Did we do good?  Yeah, I guess so, right?  Did we do good?  Yeah. 
[00:18:30]  Well, yeah.  All right.  Let me check.  Let's see.  Oh, we have a problem.  All right, well.  Hug.  Welcome back.  A hug.  Didn't take long to get right back into the swing of things.  I feel like the show needs a vacation.  You think so?  Yeah.  I'm well-rested.  Old computers and no executive producer because Gary doesn't know what the fuck he's doing. 
[00:19:00]  You got to blame somebody in the end.  I think it was a combination.  I understand.  Yeah, it's a combination.  But in the end, you know, Gary should know better.  Gary probably should sit down and go, Travis, as sort of the almost executive producer without  a business card, probably should be here the first week in September after the big  summer vacation thing.  And then Travis could argue, well, the guys, you know, they don't give enough advance warning  about vacation days and all that.  And then Gary, because supposedly he's this wizard, this radio wizard, he should figure it 
[00:19:30]  all out.  Yeah.  It's not up to me to figure out anymore.  Sorry.  No, Gary was a wizard.  He's a radio wizard.  When he sat down with me and Steve Blatter said, here's the radio wizard.  He's going to get you to places.  Radio wizard.  He said that and he actually just appeared in a puff of smoke.  Right.  It was creepy.  Forging.  Unbelievable.  We're forging ahead.  Hope everyone's vacation was nice. 
[00:20:00]  Had a nice time.  Sam went on a big honeymoon, which is.  Oh, yeah.  I was telling a lot of people in my dumb little world that how is it that Sam has a better  summer vacation than one of the than all of the show hosts?  Well, he was a honeymoon.  Yeah, it was a honeymoon.  He went to Hawaii.  I went to a couple of concerts.  I mean, no one did anything like Hawaii.  No, that's a real.  Why are you special?  I was married.  You had a honeymoon.  That was a mini moon.  And that was just Bermuda.  Oh, just Bermuda. 
[00:20:30]  Exactly.  That was the quarter moon.  That would be a honeymoon for most people.  Bermuda.  Not when you're rolling like Sam Roberts.  Oh, man.  Yeah, no.  I mean, Bermuda was just like a little fun thing right after the wedding.  I hear Bermuda's nice.  It's beautiful.  A lot of people don't even get to go to Bermuda for their honeymoon is what I'm saying.  Why?  They don't.  Well, if you live in New York, it's not really.  They maybe get to Disney World or Disneyland.  Bermuda's probably closer than Disney World is.  From New York.  It's like two hours.  You shouldn't be allowed to have two honeymoons. 
[00:21:00]  You get a mini moon.  That's a very typical thing these days.  And you should have been working last week.  I agree.  Sam was fucking around in Hawaii when things needed to be done around here.  Right.  Where is the Radio Wizard?  I like his new nickname.  I was getting bored with calling him Baldy.  Radio Wizard's way better.  Where is the Radio Wizard?  Is he in today?  I'm sure he will be.  Why wouldn't he be in today?  I mean, he's not sure.  I'm sure he'll be here.  He'll be here.  But why wouldn't he be like, okay, summer's over.  I'm going to show the guys. 
[00:21:30]  I'm going to come in early the first day back.  Oh, no.  Maybe bring in some little donuts or something and say, hey, we're all on the same team.  I'm the Radio Wizard and we're about to broadcast.  Why would he do that?  Why would he do that?  That would be an embarrassing way to introduce yourself to people that you already know.  Terrible.  Hi, I'm the Radio Wizard.  What?  He's decided to reinvent himself to that level.  I want him to walk around with a cloak.  And a wand.  A cloak?  With fucking moon shapes and shit on.  I just want the hat.  And the hat.  Pointy hat with stars on it. 
[00:22:00]  Oh, does he stink?  God, is he the worst.  Anyway.  How was your honeymoon?  Oh, it was awesome.  It was great.  We went to Maui and then Kauai.  I don't know what that means.  They're islands.  I know they're islands, but I don't know what that means.  What's the difference between the two?  Well, Maui is like a more touristy type place.  I heard it's Waui.  Yeah, Maui was very Waui.  Is Maui where they do all the surfing and the hotels are all big right on the beach?  Yeah, I mean, they do that on a lot of the islands. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, Honolulu is like the big city, just call it.  Is that what you call it?  The islands?  The islands.  Why would you go from one island to the next if it's Hawaii?  Well, Kauai is like a more sort of...  Kauai.  Look at you.  You know all the islands.  Ooh.  Hey, big shot.  But you're in a plane for like 80 hours and then all of a sudden you're going to start  taking more flights to go to another island?  Fucking why don't you settle down?  Because you get a different...  Settle down.  I don't understand these people that they go on vacation and then they have to do more vacationing  and more traveling. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah, more traveling on your vacation.  You saw the brochure, pick a hotel and settle down.  You get a different experience.  We flew into Honolulu and then from there took a quick puddle jumper over to Maui.  How long was the flight to Honolulu?  11 hours.  Holy.  It was a non-stop?  Yeah.  Were you in coach?  Yeah.  How was it?  It wasn't bad.  Actually, no, the flight there wasn't bad at all because it was a big plane.  It was Hawaiian Airlines, which is nice.  They give you food.  And it's the 3-4-2 setup, you know, the row across. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  And Jess and me were in the middle section and there was no other two people with us.  Oh, okay.  So we had the four seats to spread out across.  How would you allow yourself to be in the middle section?  How would you not have gone in advance and checked that out?  I at least need a window to check out shit.  Oh, hell yeah.  Because we figured out, I told her that this is what we'll do, because we found there were  two seats and then one seat.  So there's no way that somebody's going to take a middle seat in a middle section just  by themselves. 
[00:24:00]  So I was like, we'll at least have three seats to ourselves.  We can stretch out a little bit.  Okay.  And then the fourth seat guy wasn't there.  Sam, okay, that was smart planning.  Were you all crampy by the time your plane landed?  The seats were surprisingly spacious.  Wait till you get a little older, man.  Your knees are going to ache from those 11-hour flights.  Wait, was it Hawaiian Air or Aloha Air?  No, Hawaiian Airlines.  Okay.  Because that's probably the one you want to fly, the one that's constantly going over  the ocean and having saltwater erosion.  That didn't hurt a few years ago.  I don't think you'd want that one. 
[00:24:30]  No, you really wouldn't.  When the roof got ripped off and the woman got sucked out.  Right.  Oh, nice.  Oh, man.  How great would that be if the only thing that saved him was his shitty hair?  He just fucking clogged up the hole?  Oh, my God.  Sorry.  Like a drain?  They appear to be new planes, though.  They're really nice planes.  Okay.  They want you to think they're new planes.  They give you meals in Coach.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  The seats go back further.  What do you mean they give you meals?  You're in the sky for 11 hours.  They better feed you.  Nobody gets fed in Coach anymore.  No, they charge you, man.  They charge you.  Even for 11 hours?  They give you free blanket and pillow.  They give you free meal.  Wow.  And Coach? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  All right.  Hawaiian Air might be the fucking shit, then.  The seats are wider, and they go back further.  What's the first class seats look like?  I couldn't see them.  Wait, didn't you walk through it?  Oh, I love it.  Did they have it where you walk in, and you to the right, and you to the left?  Oh, I love that.  They had two separate doors in the flight bag.  You might have had big stars on your plane.  You don't even know it.  No clue.  Wow.  I looked at business class, though.  Yeah.  It really didn't look very much different from Coach.  It was.  It was like $350 to upgrade.  And you didn't...  How much to upgrade? 
[00:25:30]  Wait, how much to upgrade?  To business.  $350 a seat.  And it didn't look any different.  He's a cheap...  Sam's a cheap skater.  You are a cheap fuck.  I gave you a nice wedding gift.  You should have used a few bucks to fucking do the right thing.  You are.  You had the money.  That's terribly cheap.  You had the money.  No, I mean...  That's exactly the stuff that you hated that your dad would do.  Like, it's your honeymoon...  Stop being your dad.  And you could upgrade to at least business for $350 more a seat?  You know what?  Your next honeymoon, you could do the right thing.  You're nuts, dude.  Even Jess saw it.  And she said, the business class looks like it's exactly the same as Coach. 
[00:26:00]  It's the same number of seats.  There couldn't have been that much more like that.  It's a lot different.  Trust me.  I've flown business.  It's a lot different.  You should have done the right thing.  Oh, my God.  You need therapy.  You're going to be just like your dad.  That's OCD, dude.  We flew very comfortably still.  That's OCD.  You had the money.  You just had a wedding where you did very well.  You brought in a lot of fucking loot.  But we had to do like nine days in Hawaii.  That ain't cheap.  No, but for...  And if you would have said it's a thousand extra a seat,  that's crazy.  But an extra 350 a seat?  You're flying for 11 hours,  and it's only 350 to be a little more comfortable. 
[00:26:30]  You do that.  And you'd be a lot more comfortable in business.  The food is much better,  because you're probably getting first class meals.  Food.  All right.  You're getting much better service.  The chairs go way back.  It's much better.  Yeah, you sleep.  All right, enough with the dumb flight.  So what did you do?  We did a lot of relaxing.  A lot of pool time.  But then you had to get on another plane and go relax on another island.  That's so stupid.  No, because the island flights are not bad.  No?  You relax in Maui, and you also drive around. 
[00:27:00]  We did the road to Hana.  What?  What does that mean?  They have all these roads in Hawaii.  They're like these little skinny roads,  and you're driving up mountains and stuff.  Are they interstates?  Sounds dangerous.  No, they're not interstates.  I think they're still called interstate highways,  even though that's dumb, because there's no other states.  Maybe they are.  I don't know.  There's no other interstate.  Yeah.  We had to sign a thing when we rented the car  that said we wouldn't drive to Mexico.  Really?  I pointed out the absurdity as I was saying it.  That is pretty good.  How about they adjust the forms for the Hawaii people? 
[00:27:30]  So what?  You relaxed and then got on another plane to relax somewhere else.  That so doesn't make sense to me.  The flight from Maui to Kauai is only like 45 minutes,  and we went to Kauai.  That's way too long.  But Kauai was great.  They had like five pools and a saltwater lagoon.  But didn't you have pools where you were?  Not as nice pools as in Kauai.  But you were in the air for 11 hours.  The pools better be fucking nice.  They were.  They were very nice in Maui.  Why are you in a pool if you were in a plane for 11 hours?  Wouldn't you go in the ocean at that point? 
[00:28:00]  I went in the ocean, too.  That's the beauty of it.  You could have been in a pool in fucking, what do you call it?  Bestchester?  Bestchester.  Oh, God.  Because you get in the pool, and you can get out and take a dip in the ocean, come out  of the ocean, go back in the pool, get in the saltwater lagoon in Kauai.  In Kauai, you can drive around and see more of the local flavor.  It's a little less touristy.  Oh, well.  I think island hopping is just dumb.  No, it's great.  You pick a good one, and then you hang out.  Because they're different.  How long did you stay on one island, and then go to the next one? 
[00:28:30]  We did like five days on one, and four days on another.  All right.  That's not that bad.  As long as you're not going back and forth.  And how long was the flight?  Was it an hour between islands?  Yeah.  Less than an hour.  You commute every day for vacation?  Yeah, really?  That would suck.  It sounded like your vacation was awful.  No, it was great.  It sounds horrible.  It doesn't sound horrible at all.  You were in a pool, and then went in the ocean, and then back to the pool?  That's what we do on Long Island.  Yeah.  What the fuck?  First of all, it's not Long Island.  It's a little nicer than Long Island.  It's an island.  It's tropical.  It's the same thing, an island. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah.  And you can see the maps.  They don't do anything in the center of these islands.  There's a few roads, and they all are around the perimeter of Hawaii.  Yeah, because that's where the ocean is.  And there's nothing else going on.  They don't have roads at all.  So we were driving on the roads, but they don't even do it around the whole island.  You can drive until the road just ends.  Oh, it just stops?  And then you turn around.  Because that would have been a shitty beach.  I guess so.  They finally realized the road was a waste of time, and they just end it?  Yeah.  They just stopped the road.  That's weird.  You just turn around like an asshole and go back? 
[00:29:30]  It's terrible.  You get to look at everything.  Did you do a helicopter ride over a volcano?  No.  No, we went.  Yeah, why do that?  We drove up.  Do that next time you're in Hawaii.  Yeah, why not?  Why wouldn't you do that?  It's like $200 a person.  Holy fuck.  We drew a honeymoon.  It's a sickness.  We drove up a canyon.  Hold on.  You realize that you're going to look back on this, and you didn't spend the $200 to take  a helicopter over a volcano?  I didn't want to.  That's a once in a lifetime.  No, you should see everything there is to see. 
[00:30:00]  I mean, we were not leaving.  It was only $200?  That's not bad.  Did she want to do anything that you guys didn't do?  No.  Okay.  She was very happy and relaxing.  Well, she's probably signed.  She knows his sickness.  She knows he's OCD, so she's probably just kind of toes the company line, like, oh, Sam,  it's the same seats up there.  Were you sitting there figuring out how much money you're saving?  No.  Oh, damn.  I just saved $400 on that helicopter ride.  Although we would comment together when we would have a dinner that was less expensive  than we thought it was going to be, going, look at this.  But I would also tell her, don't worry. 
[00:30:30]  We can spend a little money because we're not doing a helicopter ride, so don't worry about  this.  Could have spent the money anyway.  It's the only time, hopefully, you'll do it.  You didn't see a volcano?  Oh, man.  I mean, we didn't see the top of a volcano, I'll say.  Did you do the bike ride?  No, we didn't want a bike ride.  Does a bike ride, what, the sunrise?  Yeah.  You didn't do that either?  No.  I hear that's an amazing experience.  No, we didn't.  You bring it to the top of a mountain, you watch the sun fucking come up, and then you  take the ride down.  We were talking to people, you got to pick which day you go very carefully, because lots of 
[00:31:00]  people go up, but it's an overcast day, and they don't see anything.  Yeah, but that's fun, too.  No, it's not.  You're on the top of a mountain.  You're on the top of a mountain, but you don't see anything.  You just see clouds.  How about you're on the top of the mountain as the day starts?  That's kind of neat.  We spoke to people who came back down, and they were like, we didn't even see a fucking  sunrise.  Do they speak like that?  No.  Okay, you're throwing it.  Are you throwing the fuck for flavor?  Yeah.  Local flavor.  I hate when people do that.  He's just, Sam's spicing up the, like, this edgy vacation.  Right.  Were you starting to talk to the people at the hotel and stuff, like, aloha? 
[00:31:30]  Were you saying aloha?  I never said aloha.  I made a point of not saying, hey, how you doing?  Every time somebody said aloha.  But wouldn't that just be fun?  No.  To say aloha is not how I talk.  Yeah, I think that would be just fun to do.  Did you visit Pearl Harbor?  No.  We didn't go on sightseeing tours.  How much was the Pearl Harbor trip?  I didn't even think that's...  We could save that money, too.  Where's Pearl Harbor?  Oh, my God.  Did you take a surfing lesson?  This is all...  A surf...  No, actually, I told you, I would never take a surfing lesson, because...  This is stuff you do in Hawaii, though. 
[00:32:00]  No, because I can't go home and surf, so why take a lesson?  Because it's here in Hawaii, and you're like, oh, wait, let's try surfing.  No, I'm not going to pretend I'm Hawaiian.  I'm there for nine days.  I'm not...  What the fuck did you do?  We walked everywhere.  We saw everything.  Did you go into a cave and find a tiki?  Did you suck Mr. Hanalei's dick?  I do nothing wrong as he's fucking Sam's there with his pants around his ankles.  Sam's hair is taboo.  Sam, once again, doesn't disappoint.  We went into some caves.  He goes in Hawaii and does nothing.  We went into some caves.  Well, you did.  We rented a car. 
[00:32:30]  Every day I had a car, and it was a convertible.  A convertible?  Yeah, I thought we were really slick, because we got a Mustang when we went to Maui.  I was like, yeah, we're going to be cruising around in a Mustang.  How was that?  I didn't realize every person who goes to Maui rents a Mustang.  Of course they do.  It's a Mustang.  The island is crawling with white people and Mustangs.  So obviously it didn't splurge on the car.  They just happened to have some, you know, nice wheels.  We got a convertible.  I mean, what?  How much more money was that?  I don't remember.  When we booked the trip, we were like, yeah, we'll do convertible both places.  Plus, a Mustang stinks because it's rear-wheel drive. 
[00:33:00]  I would have gotten a front-wheel drive.  I would have gotten a sensible car.  A sob.  Any mishaps at all in Hawaii?  Any mishaps?  I don't think so.  I mean, it was just...  Ooh, everything went swimmingly.  Everything was nice.  We got to, you know, nothing.  We didn't plan anything out in advance.  Because that would mean money.  No.  That's what that means.  I'm reading between the lines.  Relax.  We had a nice breakfast buffet included with the hotel every day.  So, you know what you do.  Yeah. 
[00:33:30]  Eat heavy breakfast, skip lunch.  Who's with me?  You are...  Who's with me?  I have done that in the past.  He's a total jerk.  Nine days in a row?  Pinch penny.  No lunch in Hawaii for nine days.  So then helicopter ride?  No.  Go, all right, we're going to sacrifice lunch, but I'm going to show you a volcano.  From a helicopter.  Yeah.  Look, you can...  We were doing our own...  And Jess likes to work out, so the bike thing would have been nice for her.  We hit the gym in the hotel.  And then the surfing lesson would have been kind of cool.  Like, look at us. 
[00:34:00]  And then you got pictures of you surfing.  That's dumb.  You could show your kids someday.  Look, I pretended I knew how to surf one time when I was in Hawaii.  That's not fun.  Did you wipe out?  I didn't go surfing.  Did you wipe out?  I've been waiting to play that for a while now, right?  Why not just play along, you idiot?  Jesus.  I saw his finger on the button.  Something was wrong.  Right.  How about the condoms?  No, there were no condoms.  I mean, we haven't used condoms since we were married.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  No condoms.  Are you guys, you know, trying? 
[00:34:30]  No.  No?  You can't afford a helicopter ride, let alone a baby.  You could have afforded that.  No, we're not trying to have any children.  You did very well at your wedding.  Yeah, we did.  We're trying to make some of that.  You should have, like, pushed a few of those bucks to the vacation.  A helicopter ride.  Yeah.  We didn't even care about the helicopter ride.  I went to the Grand Canyon.  I was like, yeah, I got to see this from my fucking helicopter.  It's a no-brainer.  We didn't care about the helicopter ride.  The only helicopter ride we're doing that we didn't do was in Kauai, because it takes  you, because that's where they filmed Jurassic Park. 
[00:35:00]  Oh.  And you can only get to that waterfall by helicopter.  Why would you do that?  Like they did in Jurassic Park.  Right.  Why would you do that?  Because I don't go on movie tours when I go on vacation.  It's stuck.  Yeah, exactly.  It's still a cool waterfall to check out.  And you just pretend you're looking at the island like the old guy did when he got off  the helicopter.  Take my picture.  No, no, no.  There's no reason to.  What was the number one thing you did on vacation?  Like the one thing where you're like, the wow moment.  I really liked driving up the, I think it was the Wamalea Canyon. 
[00:35:30]  Something like that.  But it took like.  Driving.  40 minutes.  That's what he enjoyed the most.  Driving.  Driving up a hill.  40 minutes up a hill.  Wow.  You get to, you can see it's very scenic.  Plus, we went on a road.  It was Nick.  By accident.  You're good.  It was way longer and nobody else was driving on it, so it was a little like, uh-oh, where  are we going?  Because it was the wrong road.  Oh.  And all the street signs had bullet holes in them.  Ah.  That's nice.  But we got to the top of the canyon. 
[00:36:00]  Got to see the beautiful scenery.  Beautiful canyon.  Way up high.  And drive back down.  It's amazing in Hawaii.  How are the hotels?  Really nice.  Did you see the honeymoon suite?  No.  Why would you?  We just had a room.  Oh, man.  Not even a honeymoon suite.  Oh, boy.  Ocean View costs a lot more.  Why would you?  No.  Actually, hold on.  I understand, like, you have a checklist and you go, all right, we can't do all these  things, obviously, so maybe we'll blow off the, you know, the ocean view so we can  do the helicopter ride. 
[00:36:30]  We're just chilling in Hawaii.  And maybe we'll blow off the surfing lesson to, you know.  Just chilling.  Yeah.  How long are you spending in the room anyway?  Am I right?  Keep the curtains drawn.  Who cares?  What difference does it make where you are?  You want an ocean view?  Let's go to the beach.  Am I right?  What was your view in Hawaii?  The first night of the honeymoon was not a good view.  What was the view?  For her.  The first night?  Yeah.  Because we had to switch the room.  He had to switch rooms.  Why?  Oh, what happened?  Well, we got to the hotel and they said you're in. 
[00:37:00]  Tarantula?  No.  Oh, no?  No.  AIDS?  AIDS?  Playing on dad's ribs.  Love that one.  Yeah, it's an oldie but a goodie.  Oh, I love that.  We were in room 101.  Oh.  Which we were like, okay.  Don't go into room 101.  Room 101 in any hotel has to be the worst place to be.  The worst.  Has to be.  Because then we found out the lobby is on floor three.  Oh.  Which, so it's the basement.  You're in the basement of the fucking...  You were in a basement in Hawaii? 
[00:37:30]  Wait, did you have no window views?  Well, we went just the first night.  We got down the elevator.  You never disappoint.  We got down the elevator and we looked out.  Oh.  And directly across from our room is the hotel...  A little piggy blowing some man.  Did someone spill a fucking avocado all over you?  Avocado on you.  So what happened? 
[00:38:00]  You were going downstairs to go to the goose and duck soiree.  Directly across from our room is the hotel doctor's office.  Holy shit.  Which immediately we're like, what?  And then we look and we're like, wait, that's 101.  Directly to our right.  We were actually the room next to both the elevator and the ice machine.  Holy shit.  We went into the room.  What a racket.  Our view was directly below the valet parking lot. 
[00:38:30]  It was like one of those basements where you can half see out the window.  Holy shit.  In Hawaii?  In Hawaii.  No one gets that room.  And there was construction on the other side of the room.  Right outside the room.  I would have been out of my...  So what happened?  What did you do?  We immediately called.  You had the worst travel agent ever.  Who was your travel agent?  I don't remember.  They stink.  You're right.  Why would they put you in room 101 in Hawaii?  It was terrible.  We called the front desk and they were sold out that night.  Paging Mr. Herbind. 
[00:39:00]  Paging Mr. Herbind.  You have a telephone call at the front desk.  Maybe it was because we checked in late.  And so maybe that's why we're getting mad at you.  Maybe we didn't have a room room.  Yeah.  They were like, this is the last one.  But...  So we had it...  And we didn't care the first night because we were exhausted.  That room is for the staff when they're tired.  Right.  And they have some kind of function.  Like, you know, room 101.  Just fucking sleep all night.  I ain't going to sleep.  Right.  What hotel?  What's that hotel?  It was a Hyatt.  Okay.  Yeah.  It was so bad that, you know, we switched the room and the next day in the afternoon 
[00:39:30]  they put us in a different room.  So 10%, over 10% of your occasion was wasted in a shitty room.  No.  We didn't spend 10% in the room.  We were in Hawaii.  But one night.  One out of your nine nights.  Yeah, but many of those hours were spent unconscious.  Asleep.  So it didn't matter.  So now what room did they put you in?  From your exhausting flight because you didn't upgrade.  Exactly.  All the sleep that you should have gotten on the plane.  Sam is a good spin doctor, but it ain't happening today, sir.  Well, when we got to the front desk to be like, you know, we're switching rooms. 
[00:40:00]  We were told to blah, blah, blah.  The guy was like, okay, what room are you coming from?  And we said 101, and he looked at us and went, ah, the creme de la creme.  Oh, see, they know.  They told us that's what they call a last cell room.  What was the upgrade?  The upgrade.  We looked out over a nice mountain.  What floor?  Fifth.  How big was the hotel?  Probably eight floors.  Okay.  That's acceptable.  But your travel agent, I hope he's right, your travel agent fucking eats asshole 
[00:40:30]  because they should have said, look, this is a honeymoon couple.  Yes.  Take care of them.  A honeymoon couple, yes.  Usually that means something.  Although probably the whole hotel was filled with honeymooners.  Yeah, everyone there.  That's a real hack honeymoon.  I mean, it's a nice thing you did.  That must have been where they put the interracial couples, too, I bet.  Oh, in 101?  That's right.  And they were like, ah, put this fuck in.  That's right.  They call it the Heidi Klum suite.  I don't know what Sam's problem is.  The Heidi Negro.  I don't know what Sam's problem is.  You've got to hide them in the basement. 
[00:41:00]  Oh, shit.  Jesus.  Sam's got a real problem on it.  Yeah, he's a Jesus.  Because it's easy.  And I'm sure we'll hear it later today.  Oh, you guys have money, blah, blah, blah.  When I didn't have money, I just did the right thing.  Oh, yeah.  It's called debt.  Look into it.  You know how to splurge a little bit.  Yeah, we're not talking about blowing a lot of money.  $3.50 a seat on your honeymoon to upgrade to business from coach is a massive upgrade.  Mistake number one.  That was mistake number two. 
[00:41:30]  No fucking helicopter ride to either the waterfall or the fucking volcano.  We didn't care about the helicopter ride.  That's mistake number two.  Mistake number three.  No surf lesson while you're in Hawaii.  The surf lesson is stupid.  Why would you take a lesson in something that you can't do?  Did you go to a luau?  No.  We were like, that's lame, too.  Did Jess take a hula lesson?  No, she didn't take a hula, man.  Mistake number four.  You know why the luau is lame?  Because you have to sit around and talk to other people who are staying in your hotel.  So?  That's the worst.  But then you could say, please pass the poi. 
[00:42:00]  Please pass the poi.  What is poi?  I don't know.  Some fucking traditional dish.  You pig?  No.  But you know what we did?  We were smart.  We went to dinner.  And the luau is outside.  Right?  So guess who watched the performances without going inside the luau?  Oh, my God.  Was the luau charged?  Oh, my God.  Oh, yeah.  He's like a hundred dollars.  He did the strip club move.  Oh, he did.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah, we did.  The strip club move, obviously, you know, you watch someone else's lap dance. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  Sam and Jess were like the locals in Apocalypse Now when they were watching the strippers.  Yeah.  Right over the bushes.  We saw they were talking about the history of why and whatnot.  I bet you had to turn all the way around to see the performances, right?  Well, we had to look over the bushes.  Wow.  Like tiptoes.  It's like when you park up the hill to the drive-in.  Yeah.  Kind of watch the movie.  Oh, Sam's the worst.  You are.  You are terrible.  It's not too late for you.  Well, I mean, it's not...  It's an illness.  Why don't you heed our advice? 
[00:43:00]  Because we had a wonderful time.  Yeah, but you're doing the same mistakes your dad did to you.  Yep.  And the same annoyance your mom had, Jess is going to build up.  Because Jess is fucking smoking.  Who was your travel agent?  Obviously, that had something to do with this, too.  Jess should be treated like a princess, right?  That's right.  She's happy.  Oh, stop.  She had a wonderful time.  She had a satisfactory time.  Yeah, she probably did have a nice time.  Yeah, yeah.  But I guarantee there was a couple things that bugged her.  Mistake number.  I forgot what number.  Five.  Five or six.  No lunch for nine days.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, we had heavy breakfast and snacks by the pool. 
[00:43:30]  Snacks by the pool.  And you guys weren't drinkers, so you saved a lot of money on the drink bill.  Yeah, and they gave us a free bottle of champagne or something like that.  Oh, did you sell it?  Yeah, I wanted to.  We didn't drink it.  You didn't drink it?  No.  Well, you don't drink, so I can't beat you up for that.  You know what we did?  And this one was Jess's idea, not my idea.  This is a very smart idea on her part, though.  Without a Met Gentleman?  Without a separate evening. 
[00:44:00]  Wow.  Just explore individually.  Just stay here.  We knew we were going to have snacks, because we planned in advance skipping lunches.  Sure.  Why were you skipping lunches?  Were you really doing that just to save money, or were you guys just busy?  No, no.  You didn't skip lunch to save money?  No, we knew going.  We were bringing tears to E-Rock's eyes just saying skip lunch.  I know.  Two things he hates.  So what?  Skipping and lunch for the people that didn't get it.  Skipping and missing lunch, yes. 
[00:44:30]  We bought snacks at the Walmart after we left the airport.  Before we got to the hotel, you went to a Walmart in Hawaii?  That's right.  That's what honeymooners do in Hawaii.  Holy fuck, Sam.  That way we don't have to pay the gift shop prices.  Late night condom run is the only time you would need that, and that's for somebody that  uses them.  Right.  Other than that, no reason to go to a Walmart.  What kind of snacks did you buy?  We had all kinds of great stuff.  We had Pringles.  We had mini Oreos.  But she doesn't eat any of this stuff.  No, she was enjoying the mini Oreos.  Native Hawaiian food. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, exactly.  That's what you partook in.  Have some poi, you jizzbucket.  Baked Lays.  Did you have any pineapple?  Jess enjoyed the pineapple.  I did not.  I had my breakfast every morning.  Oh, no.  It was raisin bran, bacon, and watermelon.  Watermelon?  Bacon, watermelon.  Of course, yeah.  You are so black.  Wow.  Every morning.  Pineapple.  You didn't even try fresh pineapple in Hawaii.  No.  Jess said it was good, though.  Mistake number, what am I up to?  Seven, maybe? 
[00:45:30]  I had fish and chips, though, for one meal.  Fresh fish.  You know, that's good in Hawaii.  That's good.  And I had to explain to Jess the battle that runs through my brain as I'm chewing the fish,  knowing that my taste buds are enjoying it, but my brain just keeps reminding me that  I don't like fish, I don't like fish, I don't like fish.  That's your OCD.  You're sick.  Why don't you like fish?  I don't know.  I was eating it, and it tasted fine.  So why say to yourself, I don't like fish?  I wasn't doing it.  It was my brain involuntarily doing it.  She's sick, this dude.  He's OCD. 
[00:46:00]  He's terrible.  That kind of chronic cheapness is OCD, and your food stuff is all OCD.  Weird shit.  At least he ate the fish and chips.  Do you feel like you've accomplished something when you get to not pay for something?  Do you walk away and just think about it for a while?  You're like, I really saved some cash right there.  When there's a good value, that's a feeling of satisfaction.  But not on your honeymoon.  That's when you have to kind of let your brain go, all right, shut the fuck up, brain.  I'm going to do a few little things here today.  No, there's no reason that we can't feel come home being like, look, we had a great time, 
[00:46:30]  and we didn't even spend that much money.  This is like a twofer.  How much money did he save?  Did he figure it out in the end?  No, not yet.  We were exhausted yesterday.  But you will figure it out in your head?  I mean, we were allocated.  We figured it's going to cost, it could cost like $100 a night for the two of us to have  dinner every night.  Yeah.  No, it did not.  No, it did not.  So we saved some money there.  What did you eat?  Leaves?  Plus.  We didn't do any zip lines.  We didn't do any helicopters.  I was going to ask you, did you do anything that was Hawaiian? 
[00:47:00]  Dude.  We did, like, we explored.  We went to villages.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're not getting away with that one.  Why not the zip lines?  That sounds like, wow, that would be a cool thing to do in Hawaii.  Well, I didn't want to anyway, because I'm afraid of heights.  Right.  But we didn't do any of the tourist stuff.  Yeah, why do that?  They didn't want to spend money.  They wanted to walk around.  She tolerated it because Sam did marry her, but believe me, there was a part of her where  she was like, ugh, business class would be nice.  What this could have been.  No.  She was so close to a good vacation, but she's at the place, but then you just, like, don't 
[00:47:30]  do anything.  Her whole vacation was peeking over the bushes.  Like, instead of realizing that you married way out of your zone, you really did.  You went to a much higher level.  That's fair.  She tolerates your wrestling nonsense.  She tolerates your dumb chair that's signed and going away and allowing you to decorate.  You gotta, at times like that, you gotta spend the extra $350, I'm telling you, because  that shit's gonna creep up on you.  That's where you gotta spend it. 
[00:48:00]  Right now, she's very happy, and I kept asking, are you having a good time?  She's having a great time.  That means you were scared she wasn't having a good time.  Yeah, because he knows he's chiseling.  But we had...  When you're on a good vacation, you never ask that, because you just know it's happening.  But it wasn't like, are you having a good time?  It was like, isn't this great?  Well, of course.  Then what, is she gonna go, no?  We had desserts.  Every, almost every night.  And I normally wouldn't be like, let's go get dessert.  A treat.  Why, why desserts?  Because we're on vacation.  Why not spend the extra money on ice cream? 
[00:48:30]  It's brainhound chanting, both of them with lactose farts at two in the morning.  There's lots of shave ice places, so let's go get a shaved ice.  Because that's pretty cheap.  That's a cheap dessert.  Exactly.  It's not expensive.  I told you, nine?  That's a little local flavor.  Oh, no, it's not.  This guy spent 22 grand on his Hawaiian honeymoon.  Oh, my God.  He's a fucking idiot.  Why would you spend 22?  Oh, man.  I'm not saying you were supposed to spend 22,000.  No.  Probably for an extra grand, you probably would have had a little better time.  I wasn't spending an extra grand. 
[00:49:00]  Why not an extra grand?  Because a grand is a lot.  Wow.  It isn't.  That's why it's called grand.  You do great things with it.  A grand.  No, it's great to have.  Oh, no.  To do what with them?  To do what?  What are you going to spend it on that's more important?  You don't spend it on a TV.  Because Jess, also, the reason Jess doesn't mind this stuff is because she is also future-minded.  She's not so wrapped up in the right now.  Really?  Was she getting a divorce lawyer?  No, but what's happening in the, think about it rationally, what's happening in the future 
[00:49:30]  that's so important that, like, on your honeymoon, you wouldn't spend $3.50 a seat to upgrade  to a much better class of service?  $3.50 plus $3.50 is $700.  $700.  Plus two, that becomes $1,400.  Right.  For, again, this is not a trip to Florida or Chicago.  So this is as far as you can fly in the United States, possibly Alaska might be the exception.  What's more important?  Like, what are you doing that $1,400 will make or break five years from now? 
[00:50:00]  Well, I don't know if it's, it's just, it's...  But think about it.  That specific cost wouldn't have done much.  But we have, you know, we're going to eventually have kids.  We're going to eventually have a house.  You're going to try, you're going to be skifflet with them because the sickness won't change.  Cheaply risen, raised kids.  They're going to have a great time.  Poorly reared idiots.  Poorly reared, yes.  I can't comprehend.  You go to Hawaii.  Granted, you know, maybe not do all the things we suggested here today, but like a volcano. 
[00:50:30]  Who gets to see a volcano?  You're that close.  And you go, can we drive to a volcano?  Do we take a helicopter?  How do we see the fucking volcano?  Why wouldn't you see a volcano?  We did the road to Hana.  Did you see a volcano?  In the distance, at least?  Yeah, oh yeah, in the distance, sure.  It's all mountainous.  The road to Hana stinks.  No, it doesn't.  Yeah, that's terrible.  It's a road.  Exactly.  Fuck Hana.  It's a road.  Jess got a little car sick, but...  Oh, God.  Of course she did.  It was beautiful.  She didn't actually throw up, but she felt nauseous.  Yeah, you just feel like shit.  She probably felt that way when she saw the room, when she realized she was in coach and 
[00:51:00]  she could have sat in business.  When she said, I do.  When she said, I do.  Next to her.  Every night when she was looking up, that dumb hairdo over the pillow.  Right.  I didn't tie my hair back once when I was in Hawaii.  Wow, you're a wild man.  I think I speak for everyone.  When you go to a new place, you think of the one thing that you're going to see there  that you're not going to see anywhere else.  You do that.  I get not doing the surf lesson and the zip line, I guess, because you kind of could do  that stuff elsewhere.  But a volcano, you're never going to have that opportunity. 
[00:51:30]  Did you go to the black sand beaches?  We did go to one black sand beach, yes.  How was that?  It was awesome.  What's a black sand beach?  It's just black sand.  Yeah, but it's like, because it's volcanic.  We saw lava rocks.  We saw caves that you could just swim in and it was clear.  But you saw them.  Did you swim in a cave?  I like when you said that.  You didn't go swimming?  Why?  Why?  You're in Hawaii?  You didn't even take a dip in the water?  To a cave?  No, in that specific cave.  Why wouldn't you swim in caves?  Jess didn't want to swim in a cave. 
[00:52:00]  We didn't swim in a cave.  Jess didn't want to.  Why wouldn't she swim in the caves?  We were getting back in the car.  Why wouldn't you?  We were doing some more.  So that's what you say.  I would have.  How much would it cost to have swimming in a cave?  Wait, wait, wait.  You didn't hear what he just said.  I would have.  Why didn't you?  Because if Jess doesn't want to, I don't want to spend a lot of time.  Tell her to fucking get some sun.  I'm going to go check out the caves.  Look at this canyon.  Let me ask you a question, Sam.  Would it have cost money to swim in the caves?  No.  Okay.  Why didn't you swim in the caves?  Maybe we didn't want to.  We were on a tour that we were guiding ourselves on.  Oh, boy. 
[00:52:30]  You chose not to go on the guided tours either, did you?  No, we got a GPS.  How much is that?  Like 50 bucks a person in about?  60, maybe 70 dollars a person?  We had a GPS tour guide that we just plugged in a car with us.  You didn't even take a fucking tour GPS tour guide.  $39 a day.  You didn't even take one guided tour?  Oh, you returned it that day.  On the way back, we returned it, but...  One day, he had his little GPS guide.  You didn't do one guided tour.  I hate guided tours.  You're in Hawaii, though.  No, I hate...  We didn't want to do anything where we had to go with a bunch of other people, a bunch 
[00:53:00]  of tourists.  We didn't want to have any of the shitty tour guides that are just giving us the runaround  bullshit.  But you didn't do anything.  We went...  Logically, you're explaining every single one of these, but in the end, you didn't do anything.  We went to the places where the guided tours are, but we just drove there.  But you didn't know what was going on there, because no one was telling you.  No.  We knew what was going on.  We went to, like, all the little local neighborhoods and stuff.  Did you, like, go to any of these towns that maybe were wiped out by lava? 
[00:53:30]  Well, we went to towns.  They weren't wiped out by lava, but they had lava rocks in them.  I stood on a lava rock.  There's a picture of me.  Was your under one?  Thanking for help.  There's a picture of me.  Tootsie's all hot.  They weren't fresh in lava rock.  Oh.  Oh, man.  There's a picture of me standing on a lava rock.  That's good for you.  Exactly.  There should be a picture of you in front of a fucking volcano.  You're obsessed with this scene.  Bubbling hot magma coming up behind you. 
[00:54:00]  Yeah.  You should have melted your sneakers.  No.  That'd be cool.  You're obsessed with seeing the top of a volcano.  I don't know if I'd take the helicopter ride because I'm scared of helicopters.  That I might not do.  Right.  But I would have at least, I would have done other stuff.  You would have done something.  Oh, yeah.  We did do stuff.  I don't know what you did.  You didn't even have lunch.  You didn't even have lunch.  You didn't even have lunch, no.  Why wouldn't you?  Was she hungry during the day?  No, we had snacks.  From Walmart.  Oh, the Walmart snacks.  I forgot about the Walmart snacks in Hawaii.  Yeah. 
[00:54:30]  Holy fuck.  I want to sit your dad down.  Your dad's a really nice guy and go, look at this one rubbed off.  I want to just pull out his mustache.  What are you doing?  Look what you did.  Look what you did.  Look what you did, sir.  We went to...  It's a big kahuna burger?  We went to Bubba's Burgers.  It's that Hawaiian joint.  Isn't Bubba...  That's like a...  You can get that anywhere, no?  No, there's...  I mean, there's probably other Bubba's Burgers, but there's a franchise.  It's in Kauai, and there's only three of them.  But they had a broken toilet seat signed by Ozzy... 
[00:55:00]  That's kind of cool.  See?  Should have bought it.  It probably wasn't Ozzy.  It was probably some drunk guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to see all kinds of crazy stuff.  Look at this.  It's Ozzy Makawahani.  O-Z-Z-I-E.  Yes.  He's an old fucking...  What's that shitty instrument they play there?  Oh, that's stupid ukulele.  The uke.  We got to see stores that just sold ukuleles.  That's crazy.  You don't see that.  Did you go see Don Ho?  No.  Don Ho. 
[00:55:30]  Is he dead?  I think Don Ho's dead.  We saw a magic show.  Did you go see where they filmed Hawaii Five-O?  No.  How about where they filmed Lost?  No, I don't care about Lost.  Or Jurassic Park.  What's the matter with you?  I don't do these movie tours.  What's the matter with you?  It's more universal.  It's more than a movie tour because it's an amazing waterfall that you can't even walk to.  You have to fucking be in the air to see it.  That's something cool.  We drove around and saw waterfalls on the road to Hana.  And I usually don't do tourist trappy things, but...  It sounds like you do.  It does sound like I do, Sam.  You're right.  But you didn't do anything.  Let's look at your honeymoon photographs. 
[00:56:00]  There's only a couple of them that I posted, but...  Look at that.  That's on top of the Waimea Canyon.  What are we looking at?  That's the canyon.  That was what I was looking at.  What is it?  There's not too many filters on that.  That's like Mars.  Know why he had to filter up his shit?  Because he wasn't going to the cool places.  Yeah, that's just fucking rough.  So now he takes his boring photographs and he fucking filters the shit out of them.  That's terrible.  No.  Why would you filter any pictures from Hawaii?  It's boring.  Throw filters on there. 
[00:56:30]  It's Hawaii.  They should be beautiful naturally.  Yeah, you don't need filters.  You fucking hashtag no filter, bitches.  I thought Photoshop a volcano on that motherfucker.  But I like...  You just put no filter anywhere.  What are we looking at, Sam?  I'm getting really fucking pissed at you spending money.  But what is it?  It's a canyon.  What's down below?  Grass?  There's grass down below.  There's rocks.  There's trees.  We're up in the clouds, for God's sakes.  We're way high.  Look at this view.  Yeah, it looks like you're way high.  In the clouds.  We take a picture from the clouds. 
[00:57:00]  All right, next picture.  I'm not impressed by your first one.  Well, you don't have to.  You filtered the shit out of it.  Yeah.  Let's see.  That's terrible.  Look at this sunset.  That's filtered.  I do that every fucking day.  Yeah, but not like that.  That's better than your sunset picture.  You filtered the shit out of it.  Yeah, of course.  That's the new shit.  But if you're in Hawaii, I hear the sun sets are just beyond amazing.  They're great.  So let's see the picture without the filters.  I didn't post it.  That's a good one.  Sam is a cheapo dullard. 
[00:57:30]  Look at this.  Just sitting by...  It looks like a backdrop.  Yeah, that's a nice view.  Just sitting by the pool, chilling, looking.  You know what we're looking at?  You arrive at your hotel and go, holy fuck, look at this view.  Right.  All right.  That's where you start.  Now what?  You hang by the pool for a while.  You're on your honeymoon.  You're relaxing.  You have three honeymoon pictures.  Yeah, on the internet.  I'm not sharing my honeymoon photos with the...  Oh, man.  But you put...  World Wide Web.  You put your best foot forward.  You put your best foot forward.  What?  What do I have to prove to people? 
[00:58:00]  I don't have to prove to Twitter followers that I have a honeymoon.  Two pictures that you had to filter the shit out of to make better, and the view from your  hotel, which is nice.  Yeah.  That's all I posted.  But that's what you get when you fucking step off the plane.  But this wasn't a vacation of posting pictures to impress people.  That you didn't have a fucking better time.  I had the greatest time ever.  Why are we mad if this is how he wants to live?  You go and you relax.  You spread aloha. 
[00:58:30]  Aloha.  You went to Walmart for...  You spread aloha?  I wish that was Hawaiian for your brains all over the ceiling.  With a gun.  You went to Walmart to get snacks so you didn't have to eat lunch.  That's crazy.  Well, we had big breakfast, too.  A lot of bacon.  Ah, the big breakfast.  The big breakfast.  Did you fucking put a little in your swimsuit on the way out?  No, but I should have.  Definitely should have.  That was hurting, right?  You were bothered by the fact you couldn't grab...  Oh, that he had to leave food behind.  You could have a to-go box.  You don't to-go.  You hit that buffet on the way out.  You grab whatever the fuck you can. 
[00:59:00]  And just go.  And you see where that doorway is.  Come on.  I didn't do that.  I was too busy relaxing in Hawaii.  Oh.  Ran into a couple listeners here and there.  What?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  You could do that.  That's true.  I mean, I think...  Sounds great.  You ask people who go to Kauai.  You go and you relax.  How much did...  That was the purpose of the trip.  How much did your honeymoon cost to Hawaii?  Because people are saying I spent $10,000, $12,000.  It wasn't...  We definitely kept it significantly under $10,000. 
[00:59:30]  Significantly.  But that means $5,000.  I would hope that it was the ballpark.  It was probably about $6,000.  Between $6,000 and $7,000.  Maybe $6,500.  You went to Hawaii for $6,500 for a million days?  I see me traveling.  Two people.  Amazing.  Holy shit.  I think it was about that.  Fucking amazing.  Maybe $7,000.  I think that's almost impossible.  Pretty good.  Yeah.  In this day and age.  You go and you relax.  You should write a book about that.  And it's called How to Put Saving Money Above All Fun. 
[01:00:00]  No.  If you spend $7,000, which might be high, half of that would probably be your hotel bill.  We're close to it, right?  Could be.  I mean, yeah.  Maybe not half, but, you know.  You should write a book, How to Be a Chiseler.  Look, you go and you relax.  I work a lot.  Go to Hawaii.  You don't do anything.  No, you do things.  Then you shouldn't have picked Hawaii.  No, that's a perfect place to relax.  No, Hawaii is the type of place where you really should get out and experience things. 
[01:00:30]  Someone said you should have just gone to L.A. and gotten a studio apartment.  There you go.  Or, I mean, you go to Miami for that.  You get a nice little hotel room close to a beach and just chill out.  By the way, why did you go this time of year?  Like, why this month?  Probably because I bet the rooms are cheaper at the last week of August.  I thought that the show was going to be off the last week of August.  Oh.  Okay.  He did.  No, no.  That's a good guess.  He just assumed.  Absolutely.  Good thinking.  And he wanted to be back when the show was on.  That is responsible.  I'm not saying that Sam's not responsible. 
[01:01:00]  His issue is this fucking money thing.  Holy fuck.  I'm no fun.  Holy fuck.  Very responsible.  No, but in your head, you're having a blast.  That's why I think we all get frustrated.  Jess had a blast, too.  You just go and chill out.  You think she did.  You spread aloha.  She's too nice to tell you, you know, that it sucked.  You throw up the horns.  The horns.  You know?  You wouldn't believe.  We saved so much.  One night.  We thought we were going to spend like $100 on dinner.  No.  No.  We found like a little Mexican spot.  There's like a hole in the wall. 
[01:01:30]  Mexican.  Called the crack.  Called Taco Bell.  You're eating Mexican food while you're in Hawaii?  Little local spots.  That's local to everywhere.  It was delicious, fresh food.  I got two Mexican joints within two blocks of my place.  Yeah.  It was nice, but you know, it's home.  I don't know where I could get Hawaiian food in Manhattan.  So if I'm in Hawaii, I'm like, you know what?  We're going to eat so much fucking pineapple, it's going to be coming out of our eyes.  No.  There's like nice, fresh ingredients.  What do you have?  Well, I didn't.  No, I didn't go at the crack.  Then we went to Bubba's Burgers, and I got chicken sandwich. 
[01:02:00]  Why not at least eat in nice restaurants?  We ate in nice restaurants.  We did a nice mixture.  Some nights we had a nice restaurant.  Wait, you didn't eat at the Mexican joint?  No, because there was a hole in the wall.  There was no place to sit down.  So who ate there?  Jess ordered food there, and then we went and ordered.  The place had no tables.  She got it to go?  There was no tables.  It was only to go.  She got Mexican food to go.  I can't wait until you come in frowning.  She called a lawyer. 
[01:02:30]  That's what she wanted.  No.  I don't know why it frustrates me, because it's your life, but man.  And what did you get on the chicken sandwich?  Did you at least have it where it felt Hawaiian?  Hawaiian ended up.  I did this Hawaiian thing where they put lettuce and tomato on it.  Wow.  Yeah, so.  Where am I going to?  I don't put anything on sandwiches.  Where am I going to put?  Pineapple sauce?  Mexican food to go.  On a Hawaiian honeymoon.  We were all hoping to live through it, because we didn't do anything for our summer break.  It was fucking awesome. 
[01:03:00]  You guys would have had a blast.  I went to a couple of concerts, and you had this fucking, you know?  You would have loved it.  That's how sick I would have.  But even if I had no money, I would have done way more than you did.  No, you would have relaxed.  What do you do?  You go to the Outer Banks for two weeks, and you just sit on a beach.  You relax.  Yeah, because see, the difference is, yeah, I get going to a place and just doing nothing.  That's why you pick somewhere like the Outer Banks, where you're on a four-by-four beach.  You drive out to your house, and that's it.  You don't really go back to town.  Maybe once. 
[01:03:30]  What about Kauai?  Yes, I get where you just fucking settle in.  But you don't settle in in Hawaii.  Yeah, you do.  You don't settle in in Hawaii.  But you, when was the last time you were in Hawaii?  It sounds like you should have done Miami for your honeymoon.  No, you go to Hawaii, it's so much nicer than Miami.  How do you know?  I've been to Miami.  You don't even know.  I've been to Miami.  No, for Hawaii, I didn't even know.  We saw your three...  I encourage everyone to go to your Instagram to see the three sad pictures you posted.  First of all, they're beautiful. 
[01:04:00]  With a lot of filters.  It's not Sam on Instagram.  They're beautiful pictures.  Do you realize with Instagram, as soon as you start fucking around with filters, you  know your shot is shitty, so you're trying to fucking pump it up.  It's not a shitty shot.  Pump it up a little.  That's the new shit, is to way go crazy with filters.  Not when you're in Hawaii.  That's right.  You're going to go round and round with this shit.  No.  The new shit is to just load it up with as many filters as you can.  Stupid Roland taking a picture of the skyline for the 10,000th time.  I get it.  You throw a filter on it.  Not when you're in Hawaii. 
[01:04:30]  You load that shit up.  Linden is dumbass.  Pictures of the skyline.  We get it.  Every night.  Every night.  Every night.  I would post them from airports while I was waiting on planes.  So you just play with the filters while you're waiting for your plane.  The plane from, it was a little risky.  The plane from Maui to Kauai, that was not a good plane.  Why?  It was a propeller plane.  That happens on an island.  That's puddle jumpers.  And they had to seat us accordingly to weight distribution. 
[01:05:00]  That's understandable.  They do that when you're just flying up to Buffalo.  Never been on a prop plane?  No, I don't think so.  How long of a flight was it?  It was only 45 minutes.  Yeah, that's what they do on the, what do you want, a fucking 767?  It took us 45 minutes.  Did you wonder the whole time if that screw was going to hold on the propeller?  Yeah.  That's what I wonder.  The propeller screw.  It's not a new plane.  That's what I always wonder.  That one dumb fucking screw or whatever it fucking is.  Yeah, it's real loud. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  And I tried to, I was comforting, I was really comforting myself, but I pretended I was comforting  Jess because she was like, oh, this is an old plane.  And I said, Jess, this is a little bit of an old plane, but you know what that means?  And she goes, what?  And I went lots of successful journeys.  She said that?  I did.  Lots of successful journeys.  Really put her at ease.  Sure.  As it should have.  I wish that was a quote from Seconds from Disaster.  I love that show.  Exactly.  So what was the wow moment? 
[01:06:00]  The one big thing that you did in Hawaii?  Well, it was either driving up to the canyon or driving the road to Hana.  The road to Hana is an attraction.  But we learned the road to Hana just ends.  Well, yeah.  It's like shit.  That doesn't sound fun, driving.  And what is in Hana again?  It's a lot of fun.  It's a lot of fun.  Listen.  Well, you guys need to understand it.  What is in Hana?  Sometimes the destination is the journey.  It's the road to Hana.  If they're saying it's the road to Hana, that means there's some temple there or something.  It goes somewhere.  No, it's just like a little town, just like beaches and stuff. 
[01:06:30]  That's like if a Hawaiian guy came here with his fucking newlywed and was like, I took the  Long Island Expressway and we went to Yapank.  The road to Hana.  The road to Yapank.  The road to Yapank.  And then we turned around and drove back.  This thing has like 60.  No.  It has like 60 something one lane bridges.  It has over 600 curves and winds and stuff.  That's why she got car sick.  You're driving up a mountain.  Oh my God, right? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah, that's why she got car sick.  The views are the sickest thing you've ever seen in your life.  Apparently so.  She was in a vomit.  Not like that.  Like slang.  You could have drove the sawmill.  It's not the same as the sawmill.  They have a lot of twists and turns though.  She could have got a fucking car sick on the sawmill.  The views are re-dick.  Obviously, you've got pictures that you had to filter the shit out of.  I didn't post the pictures.  On the lousy three pictures you posted.  You know why I didn't post the pictures?  What's what Jess was saying?  You dick.  Oh, re-dick. 
[01:07:30]  This wasn't a vacation for Sam and the Opie and Anthony show.  This was Sam and Jessica on a honeymoon.  You know better.  When you're in the public eye, you're like, okay, here's my personal picture.  I'm going to fucking make sure I do some rock star pictures for everybody else.  That's right.  Every time I posted a picture, I posted three pictures over the course of nine days, and  every time people are going, get the fuck off Twitter, you're in Hawaii, enjoy yourself.  It's like I was trying to share with you guys, come on.  They were just mad that you didn't have much to offer.  Exactly.  You were clocking up that timeline with your shit.  Yeah, because the other thing is, a lot of people listening to us right now will never 
[01:08:00]  get to go to Hawaii, so they were living through you, and you give them three shitty pictures  with horrible filters on them.  Scenic views.  That's beautiful.  Did you see a palm tree, at least?  And what do you think those long sticks are?  I don't know, because you don't even put the palm trees in your picture.  There's palms at the end of them.  There's palm trees all over the place.  Hmm.  You know?  Hawaii.  Did you have coconut?  I had, uh...  Boy.  I think I did.  He doesn't even know.  Did you at least drink something with an umbrella in it, beverage? 
[01:08:30]  No, I don't know.  Did you at least have a glass of cum with an umbrella?  Drink alcohol.  Why does this bother me so much?  Why does it bother all of us?  Because you know that all he's doing is justifying his illness.  And is that what it is?  Yes, because you could see through, like, even though he's logically a smart guy, you  understand that underneath it is a horrible cheapness, and it's an ugly thing to see.  You're really good at explaining yourself, but I wonder if, like, you wish you were having  a little more fun.  I wonder.  I had talked about the cheap restaurants.  We also went to the nice restaurants. 
[01:09:00]  We had one where, like, just for dessert.  This was after the meal.  This was bonus.  Oh.  And I said, you know what?  What do you mean bonus?  Because you found a place where it was, like, a price-fixed?  No.  Did you go to those price-fixed menu places?  Desserts included?  No.  This is me saying.  But you allowed her to order off the dessert choice they had, where they had to say, well,  that's going to be $7 more.  This is a quote from me.  Uh-huh.  She said, why don't we just get something to split?  And I said, Jess, just get something for yourself and only have a couple bites. 
[01:09:30]  Oh.  She had.  She had creme brulee out of a coconut while we watched koi fish swimming under us.  This is amazing.  They were eating better than you.  Yeah.  No.  Why were they koi fish?  Were they batting their eyes or something?  There were penguins in the lobby of the hotel in Maui.  That's disrespectful.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah.  They called nuns.  Well, that's good.  That's all free entertainment.  Yeah, it is. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, it is.  I was talking to the parrots.  Aloha.  I don't know.  Is that what they said?  Yeah.  And one of the parrots.  Cheap cunt.  Chisler.  Chisler.  One of the parrots in Hawaii started talking to me because on the sign it said he loves the  theme song from Hawaii Five-0.  So in the middle of the hotel, I started humming, doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, and the  parrot responded accordingly.  He sang along?  No, he just started clicking at me.  What a fucking dump. 
[01:10:30]  Hey.  Man.  It was great.  It was great.  Oh, it sounds like a fucking bore fest.  Sounds terrible.  It really sounds terrible.  You go to relax.  You just go to relax.  We're going around in circles now.  You had a shitty honeymoon.  There was nothing shitty about it.  You guys are very negative people.  We are negative people, Sam.  You're right.  But you made it very easy today.  And if you guys had come with me, which I wish you had, we all would have had fun.  Next time, we'll all go on a trip together.  Yeah, because we would have paid for everything. 
[01:11:00]  That would have been nice.  That would have been nice.  I'm not picking up any tabs around you guys.  I wish Oprah were here.  They would have picked up this bill and not even thought about it.  Yeah, you guys would have made me go to someplace nicer.  Oh, yeah.  Pick up the bill.  Oh, what are you doing, this poor girl?  It was nice.  She must be starving at this point.  Oh, for everything.  Everything.  Yeah, especially Peckas.  Oh, man.  Oh, hey.  What?  I'm just saying.  They had cabanas in Kauai.  Yeah?  Yeah, we didn't get enough. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, wow.  They also had, more importantly, umbrellas, which are free.  Cabanas are not.  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm glad you got an umbrella.  I bet you if you had to pay for them, you certainly would have saved on the umbrella.  You know what we would have done?  Get in the water.  How much are the cabanas?  I don't know.  We didn't even check.  Well, those could be expensive.  You didn't even check?  I heard how much yours was in Vegas.  Well, they are a little expensive.  No, that's something where I would understand.  That could be very expensive.  But he could have checked.  Check it out.  Right.  Check it out.  Doesn't it hurt to check?  No, it doesn't hurt to check. 
[01:12:00]  He just knew.  He just knew.  He just knew.  Imagine that.  $10 a day.  Jesus.  There's no way.  Son of a bitch.  Plus, Jess wanted to relax, too.  One day, you get a cabana.  You and Jess are in there, nice and romantic.  We spent the whole day by the pool.  Under umbrella.  Oh, boy.  You got Mexican food in Hawaii.  It was delicious and fresh, according to Jess.  I didn't have any.  What a dick.  You guys would have had a blast.  It was about relaxing.  I wanted to relax.  Jess wanted to relax.  You didn't try the local food.  You didn't try. 
[01:12:30]  We didn't try the local food.  We didn't try any of the tourist traps that you wanted to go on.  I didn't go.  You would have, but you wanted to.  Why don't you go take a surfing lesson and have some guy pretend to talk Hawaiian and  take you on a tour with a bunch of other idiots that are all, you know, old people  in Bermuda shorts.  That doesn't sound fun.  My next trip is Hawaii now.  I'm obsessed now.  I have to go.  You go.  I have to go just to see what Sam is.  And go in those.  You know what we were doing?  We saw the vans full of people on the Road to Hana. 
[01:13:00]  First of all, the Road to Hana would have taken nine hours to go with a tour because they  were stopping.  The Road to Hana stinks.  No, it doesn't.  Fuck that Road to Hana.  I hate it.  Enough about it.  Look it up.  Look it up for yourselves, okay?  It's an attraction.  It sucks.  You know what?  You should look it up, too, because I don't think you really saw it.  Yeah.  We did see it.  And they would have taken nine hours on one of those guided tours.  Is it holding Jess's hair away from her mouth so she didn't get vomit on it?  No.  Jesus.  Well, sick.  Because they stop at everything.  We drove right past those dumb buses where Opie would have been like, oh, great, another 
[01:13:30]  tree while I'm hanging out with all the other fat tourists.  Oh, man.  No, I'll jump on some of that dumb shit.  Yeah.  It's a waste of time.  You could do it yourself.  Yeah, obviously.  And it's funner.  It's called life experiences.  I love how he tries to talk us all into it.  Cheapo.  He's half right in that he wanted to do certain things, but he understands deep down that he  is covering up his chronic illness, which is horrible OCD, which is his cheapness, is  part of his OCD. 
[01:14:00]  And I know on some level you know that.  I don't think the cheapness is as bad as the food, though, so.  But again, it doesn't matter.  Just because one isn't as bad as the other doesn't mean that it's not bad.  You should have done something.  And you hated when your dad did it.  And Jess is going to feel exactly the way your mother did.  No, because I pump that AC when I get home.  My dad never liked the AC.  Yeah, that's true.  But again, that's your big concession.  Pump that AC.  Ride the TV until the end.  But if I see a wrestling figure I want to get, no problemo. 
[01:14:30]  Exactly.  You spend money on that.  Right.  Yeah.  Do you get all mad, looking at the electric bill, going like, oh boy, the fucking...  There's the beauty of it.  I spent three hulks and a fucking Mr. Mistego, whatever these fucking assholes' names are.  There's the beauty of it.  I take care of cable and internet.  Jess takes care of electric.  Busted.  Not even power?  No, that's the problem.  Oh, that's the issue?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Power supply's all busted.  I don't have to worry about the electric bill.  Sounds like you had a wonderful fucking honeymoon.  It was great. 
[01:15:00]  It was relaxing.  Good for you.  It's good to get away.  I'll agree with that.  Just chill out.  Yeah, I'm sure.  Not do anything.  At least you're here today.  Is the radio wizard here yet?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know for sure.  I wonder if he was listening to the beginning.  I am so mad right now.  Why?  At you.  Why?  Your first night in Hawaii, you had a basement hotel room.  We got...  All we did was...  He gets 101 ever.  We went, we got a snack, and we went to sleep. 
[01:15:30]  We were exhausted.  Someone's saying I should go on vacation with Sam.  No, because guess who will pay for everything and not be appreciative.  I will be appreciative.  You would be appreciative at least.  But you will be paying for everything.  Did you text people on the show?  No.  Well, just...  One, I was left alone, which was nice of everybody to just leave me alone.  Sure.  Except for one text I got while I was in Hawaii.  Oh, I wonder who it was from.  It was from Edgar. 
[01:16:00]  Edgar.  So what?  Oh, is that why you're asking about it?  Edgar.  What did Edgar say?  It's not...  It wasn't even the end.  It was like Friday.  Yeah.  And I wasn't flying back until Sunday night.  And Edgar just texted me in Edgar speak, letting me know that my vacation was over.  Get back to work and do your duty.  Wow.  Do your duty.  Yeah, do your duty.  And I showed it to Jess, and she goes, oh.  And I said, that's Edgar.  And she goes, how do you know that's Edgar?  And I go, well, because he types phonetically.  Do you know how happy I am that they had to have this talk about Edgar on their honeymoon? 
[01:16:30]  And she goes, well, how do you know that's not Chip?  I was like, Chip doesn't talk like that.  Yeah.  Yeah, we all know that.  What's wrong with you, Jess?  Give me your number.  I'll text her as Edgar.  No.  No.  All right, can we go to break?  Any romantic shenanigans?  Ooh, yeah.  Like anything that was out of the ordinary?  Yeah.  No, I mean, not just in the dumb hotel bed?  Yeah.  No, I mean, there was intimacy on most of the evenings, for sure.  How about this?  In the pool or anything? 
[01:17:00]  Did you have sex outdoors?  No.  No, it was all in the bed.  Oh, my God.  What are you doing?  You talk dirty?  No more than usual.  We've had this conversation before.  I thought I meant your honeymoon.  You might have said something different.  Yeah.  No, it was all, you know.  With lights on or off?  On.  On.  Oh, okay.  I like on.  I prefer off.  Oh, why?  I embody him as shame.  Oh.  I just, I ignore my horrible body and say, she's got to deal with it. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, you know.  Just look at what's going on.  Yeah, looking at hers would probably be great, but yeah.  Yeah, I understand.  All right, well.  Now, lots of, there was plenty of intimacy on those Hawaiian nights.  On the road to Hana?  That's right.  How do you know they were Hawaiian nights?  You were in a basement.  That was one night.  I'm so mad right now.  The basement.  That was when we first got there.  Did you bang her looking out the window at the construction worker's feet?  All right, you keep saying you only had the basement apartment.  Yeah.  You only had the basement apartment one night in Hawaii.  Right. 
[01:18:00]  What were you looking at for the rest of the time from your window?  I told you.  We had nice mountains to look at.  Oh, you saw the mountains from behind there, the hotel.  So you either had mountain views or an ocean view type of thing?  There was ocean view, mountain view, and resort view.  Resort view?  Which we had mountain view, not resort view.  You sure?  Or did you have partial mountain view where you had to kind of like move your neck all  the way around the corner?  You got to hang out over the balcony and turn your head and go, yeah, it's right there.  I looked out my window and saw a mountain and a rainbow.  It is amazing. 
[01:18:30]  Double rainbow?  Just a single hunch.  No.  So you can't even get the rainbow right?  No.  We should break.  All righty.  Yeah, we should.  I want to know what the fuck's going on in it's eye.  It's creeping everyone out.  I know.  It's terrible.  We'll explain that.  It's annoying me.  Like I see it when I look down.  I see like big blubbery fucking fat eye.  All right, Sam.  He's wonderful.  He's romantic.  He's beautiful.  Well, somebody says, excuse me, the more Sam talks, the more I just want to roundhouse 
[01:19:00]  him to the face.  From Jess on Twitter.  It's just infuriating.  Like I said, it's your life, so whatever, but, and you're really good at explaining  shit, but I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think this is way deeper.  Nope.  You go and you relax.  You know, and have a care in the world and you spread aloha like Duke did.  Fucking cheap bastard.  Yep.  If I knew you were going to do that type of vacation, I could have, I could have gave 
[01:19:30]  you a bunch of spots.  Hawaii was the spot.  Not if you don't do anything.  Hawaii is one of those adventure vacations.  Yeah.  Where you got to go do stuff.  Because you're in Hawaii.  You don't even want to go to different islands on Hawaii and explore.  Because that's stupid.  That's not stupid.  That's called exploring.  Especially you, because you were just going to islands to do nothing on those islands.  We drove and explored all the islands and the coastlines.  Oh, don't say Road to Hana again.  We did the Road to Hana.  No, we did.  Road to Hana.  We did do the Road to Hana.  It was the Road to Nowhere.  No.  The Road to Hana is paved in dullness. 
[01:20:00]  Ugh.  It's a bore.  Paved in Z's.  We saw all the...  Where's the lava wiping out a road when you need it?  Yeah.  A dumb Road to Hana.  Fuck.  We drove everywhere.  We saw, like, local towns and tourist spots and then just stuff that hadn't been touched.  Just nature stuff.  Oh, did you buy any trinkets?  Any souvenirs?  I, myself, purchased for Jess a brand new cap.  What did it say? 
[01:20:30]  I married an asshole.  I'm with the asshole.  Wait.  What kind of cap?  A spending one?  You didn't buy any souvenirs.  I bought a hat.  How about a lava rock?  I'm sure they have a lot of lava rocks.  First of all, I'm not going to buy a lava rock.  I'm going to pick it up.  You know, we were there.  I would have just picked one up and brought it home.  Yeah, why do that?  But, no, I mean, I bought her a hat.  I bought a t-shirt from Bubba's Burgers.  What did the hat say on it?  It said H-I, lowercase, like high, but... 
[01:21:00]  She doesn't have that.  She does now.  H-I.  And then instead of a dot on the I, it's the islands of Hawaii.  And that's how you say it, Hawaii.  Wait, wait.  It says high?  Yeah, like H-I.  Like H-I is the...  But it's lowercase.  Abbreviation.  Right.  For Hawaii.  Right.  And then the dotting of the I are all the little islands.  Right.  That's all she got?  To remember her time in Hawaii?  And we brought... 
[01:21:30]  My dad picked us up at the airport, so we bought him some chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.  Because why would...  Also at the airport.  You could get that at the Westchester fucking mall.  He probably did.  Yeah.  They were purchased at the airport.  Was he eating them on the way home while he's driving?  No.  Oh, I thought he would be.  Yeah.  Getting a part of his mustache stuck in his mouth.  Chewing on it.  Peeling sardines out of the can.  Oh, God.  Sam.  Those treats.  It's your life, I guess.  It was great.  We had a great time.  And we enjoyed each other.  And that was what it's all about, isn't it? 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  Right.  Enjoying each other in every aspect.  Nice.  You're really good at justifying.  That's right.  You learned that a long time ago, huh?  You're sick.  I didn't justifying.  You're sick.  Just like the rest of us.  We had a great time.  We thought we finally found somebody that wasn't sick like us.  I know, right?  You're serious.  You know what the most important thing to experience on a honeymoon to Hawaii is?  Each other.  And with that, we're going to go to break, everyone.  Because that's what's important here today.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good. 
[01:22:30]  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Good. 
[01:23:00]  Damn, you've just been polled  Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my goodness gracious  I like to make Marvel movies  Oh, oh, oh, movies

[01:24:30]  Never before has all this repurposed radio audio been available in a single compilation.  Hear what happens when a comedian telling a story about a simple trip becomes a war hero.  The American soldier has to experience loss.  I was over there. I had two milkshakes.  One of the Marines goes, you're going to have both of those fatty?  So I gave him one and then my other one fell.  I had to go back and get two more. 
[01:25:00]  The Comedians Don't Stop with Rich Voss and the conversation about technology that turns into a little something else.  Good morning. Thanks for calling Radio Shack.  You hook it up, okay?  Are you listening? Are you listening to me? Can you open a browser and go to your homepage?  Bingo. We have a winner.  Hey, was Sam talking about circumcision or docking?  Sam, what made you even want to get into docking in the first place?  For whatever reason, I wasn't circumcised obviously when I was born.  Now That's What I Call Repurposed brings you the racist rant turned into a country sweeping song. 
[01:25:30]  Balling for me, hey. Tell that to me, hey, hey.  I want to see you make a movie called Balling for me, hey.  And we really get meta with Repurposed.  Purposed is sounding weird now.  Purposed. Repurposed. Repurposed. Ice.  We've got to keep pumping them out or they won't leave us alone.  It's Now That's What I Call Repurposed Vol. 1.  Available now from Gotta Gotta Recordings and Egghead Records.  The Open Entry Show. 
[01:26:00]  I want to welcome Jim Florentine to the show.  He was asking me about my Jets.  I don't know what to think.  He scored one touchdown.  It's going to be a bad year for them.  In preseason, one throwing TD.  And that was the third string quarterback against the third string defense.  I know.  Maybe Rex Ryan's holding back some fancy offense.  Well, that's his thing.  I know we're doing the wildcat and all that.  He said we're hiding plays for the regular season. 
[01:26:30]  Okay, so then after week one, everyone's going to know your plays.  So you're basically holding them off for one game.  Yeah, there's a lot of expectation with the Jets fans because we got the Tebow.  Yeah, well...  I told Florentine, I loved watching Tebow.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  When he was doing his shit for the Broncos, I'm like, wow, this is exciting.  And I was watching every fucking time I could.  But I didn't want him on my team.  No, you don't want...  That's a complete distraction.  I'd rather watch him do all that weird shit for some other team and maybe win a few games.  You don't like him doing the Tebow?  He fucking can't throw the ball. 
[01:27:00]  You're like, look, it's Tebowing.  He literally cannot fucking throw the football and he's the quarterback.  Man.  Like one every four passes is like, wow, that's an NFL pass.  But the other three, you're like, what the fuck was that?  And you need a quarterback to throw it fucking on a dime.  Yeah, because this league, everybody's so fast.  It's all about timing and patterns and stuff.  You've got to be right on the mark.  But they're saving it for the Wildcat for the regular season.  All right, good.  Which they're playing Buffalo, which their offensive coordinator, this guy David Lee, 
[01:27:30]  is the one who invented the Wildcat.  Oh, good.  Who had it down in Miami, who knows every fucking play.  Oh, so you think...  So he knows everything.  He's the guy who invented it.  And they think they're going to go in on Sunday and show this new Wildcat.  Wildcat.  So basically, the Jets would be wise not to use the Wildcat.  Yeah, against that guy who invented it.  Right.  And their coordinator, Sperano, was the coach in Miami.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's the coordinator for the Jets now.  He never ran the Wildcat.  He was just like, okay, do it.  Whatever works, because we have a shitty team.  That's when they had Chad Pennington.  He can only throw like five yards. 
[01:28:00]  I like Chad.  No, Chad was great, man.  And then your Dolphins took him for a little while, right?  Yeah.  Where is he now?  He's finally done.  He's done, yeah.  What do you think?  Jets make the playoffs.  That's all I need.  No, no.  Not even close.  It's going to be a disaster.  Give me a number.  Give me a number for the Jets.  Six or seven wins.  Six and ten, seven and nine.  Six.  That's the best they're going to do.  See, Rex Ryan's already saying, we have the best team.  He's saying that like he's throwing that out there to be a dick.  Well, you got it.  And then he's also saying about that, I think his name is Harris, that receiver that they  picked in the second round.  Right. 
[01:28:30]  He's like, I didn't even like the guy.  I saw him on tape.  I'm like, really?  You're going to pick this guy?  He's already trashing the GM and his partner.  Yeah.  He's like, I didn't see anything in this guy because the guys dropped like four passes  in the preseason.  So the Dolphins don't have a shot.  So who wins the AFC East?  Come on, the Patriots.  No problem, right?  No problem.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  What about the, what about the, the Bills aren't going to be good.  Come on.  The Bills, everyone's picking the Bills to win like a wild card.  They're going nowhere.  And this, you got Chan Gailey as a coach and David Wanstead as a defensive coordinator. 
[01:29:00]  What about Peyton Manning?  Wanstead was a good defensive coordinator though with Dallas.  I like, I like him a lot.  Yeah, in fucking 1994 he was.  Peyton Manning in the.  He stinks now.  So was Norv Turner.  As an offensive guy, yeah.  Yeah.  But that was, yeah, 20 years ago.  What about the Broncos?  Were they a new guy there?  You know, it's a weak division, so he's going to do okay there.  Is he all right?  He'll do it like eight and eight, nine and seven.  He's not going to be all Peyton Manning.  He's going to cry eventually.  You know, no one takes Tebow for their fantasy football team.  I think that's hilarious.  Nobody should be playing fantasy football.  It's for fucking fans.  Oh, you don't like fantasy football?  It stinks. 
[01:29:30]  It's fucking gay.  It just brings a nerdness to fucking football.  That is great.  You know, nobody watches fucking football with a laptop open.  Thank God.  Nobody.  You have a fucking case of beer and some sandwiches, and you're talking about fucking getting a handjob  from a stripper in the door of the commercials from the night before.  You know, go to that page.  Oh, what's this?  Calvin Johnson's got one catch for three yards, and it's two minutes into the game.  All right.  Fucking get that shit off my screen. 
[01:30:00]  I don't want to see that.  It's fucking 102.  The game started at one.  I got stats in the bottom of the screen.  I don't give a fuck.  Everyone plays fantasy football.  I know.  They're fucking fags.  They all are.  I don't give a shit.  No fucking manly men play fantasy football.  I don't want the Ravens defense when I need them to beat New England when I'm a Dolphin  fan.  I'm not rooting for anybody else but my team.  I like when the fantasy football guys feel like they're doing something.  Because they had a good draft.  The fantasy football draft.  We're all going to get together and have a big draft. 
[01:30:30]  It's going to be fun.  We're going to sit around and have snacks.  And we're going to open our fucking laptops and our iPads.  And we're going to have a draft.  I love this.  Who are you going to take?  Finally.  How about take it in the ass, you fucking homos.  With your fucking fantasy football.  It's just nerdness.  But fantasy football, you do the draft and then you just kind of watch your guys for the  rest of the year.  That's all you do.  If you get a guy and a Patriots.  Every once in a while, you'll switch a player out.  So if you get Wes Welker and you're a big Jet fan, do you want him doing good? 
[01:31:00]  You don't.  So why even play in that?  If you're a real football fan, you shouldn't be playing fantasy football.  You don't want that guy doing good.  A lot of people do.  I don't care.  It makes Sundays a little more exciting.  There's nothing exciting about fantasy football.  It's fucking guys in khakis and button downs watching football.  Sirius thought it would.  They bring their laptops to a fucking sports bar and come over.  Who just scored that touchdown?  I go, why?  I got him on my team.  Fuck you.  Go in the ladies' room and take a piss.  But Sirius has a whole channel dedicated to fantasy football. 
[01:31:30]  Yeah, they got a fucking gay channel, too.  They got a book channel.  Those guys read books.  Jonathan listens to it in the car.  It's terrible.  Of course he does.  Wait, what does he listen to?  Book radio.  I want to fucking strangle him with a piano wire.  How do you listen to that?  Because he's an idiot.  That's why.  It's terrible.  That broad gives me dirty looks all the time.  What's her name?  Pia?  Pia?  Padua?  What's her name?  Yeah.  She gives us dirty looks because we beat her up once.  She wants to come on the show so bad.  I'm like, no.  Just fucking do your book thing. 
[01:32:00]  Book radio.  Wait, so you don't like when guys are rooting for just random players?  You're not a football fan.  If you do that.  You're a cowboy fan, right?  Would you be rooting for a giant guy because you have the receiver?  No.  And they're playing a team because you want the fucking Giants to lose every week.  So you don't want that guy catching three touchdowns.  You're not going to go, all right, well, that's good, but fuck that.  All right.  It's stupid.  How about just betting on the games?  Betting is great.  Absolutely.  Like a real man.  Degenerates should be watched.  That's all she'll be watching football.  Degenerates.  Degenerates.  Degenerates.  Give me five teams that have the chance at the Super Bowl. 
[01:32:30]  Who do you think?  Well, the Patriots are always in it.  Right.  The Ravens.  I think the Ravens got a shot this year.  Okay.  That's probably the only two from the AFC.  Texans, I don't know.  And then the NFC, you've got the Packers.  Giants, you've got to throw in there.  You never know.  And also the Saints.  That's just about it.  And maybe the 49ers could possibly.  I don't know, though.  Like the 49ers.  I think they had a good run last year.  Last year. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, you think they were lucky?  Yeah, Alex Smith.  I don't know.  That was his first good year.  I mean, he was ready to get cut.  Huh.  And San Francisco's ready to take Manning over him, get rid of him this year.  But they couldn't get him, so.  Really?  I like to play.  The whole name fantasy even sounds gay.  I know.  It's fantasy.  Well, it's my fantasy.  Yeah, it's my fantasy.  Yeah.  We just, we're going to have a draft.  Where do they have these drafts at?  Is it a fucking gay bathhouse?  Yeah.  That's where they should be.  We're going to go over a Knicks house and we're going to have the fantasy football draft.  Yeah, I think they do that.  I'll see you later, honey.  They do. 
[01:33:30]  They all get together.  They get together.  It's a big serious thing.  But the draft parties are usually over the top and they really do them up nice.  Oh, boy.  What do they do?  Serve fruit?  They have a fucking fruit platter?  A lot of guys that get a t-shirt made for the year.  Oh, bro.  What do you mean?  No way.  What is that?  What do you mean?  Oh, no.  For the league.  The league?  Yeah.  Every fantasy football fucking.  What does it say on the shirt?  I don't know.  I'm just saying.  Does it say like.  Why do you relax?  I'm not in fantasy football.  I just know.  Yeah, let's see one. 
[01:34:00]  I know a little bit about everything.  Floor T.  Come on.  Here we go.  Let's see one.  Huh?  What?  I never saw one.  I think the guy should call up because we're talking.  We're talking to a lot of people that are in fantasy football.  FFL.  FFL.  Fantasy Football League.  FFL.  Owner, GM, head coach, and head scout.  That's right.  Oh, he's doing a lot of work.  He's wearing a lot of hats.  I know.  It's unbelievable.  I don't know why he's not running a real team.  Oh, he's wearing a lot of hats and a Roman war helmet.  Remember that commercial?  Bones across the nose.  Sorry.  Remember that commercial last year that made fun of all the fantasy football guys? 
[01:34:30]  No.  Oh, we should find it.  It was pretty funny.  And it had the names of their teams, and everyone gets clever with the name of their team.  You don't remember that commercial they ran during the season last year?  Because they were all depressed that their teams were out of it?  Their fantasy football teams were out of it?  Oh, too bad.  Can you find that?  Oh, boy.  Forget it, Sam.  And they have names for their teams, too?  I didn't even know that.  They make up their own names for teams?  Fantasy.  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah.  How do the guys call?  You're out there.  Don't be shy. 
[01:35:00]  No, because they're afraid to.  Fantasy football.  They know.  Fantasy football.  There's a name for the league.  There's nothing to defend.  There's a name for each guy's fantasy football team.  They get the big draft board they set up at someone's house.  Okay, all right.  You're next.  You got five minutes.  Okay.  Oh, so they got five minutes to make a pick.  I don't know.  A few minutes.  Right, whatever.  Whatever it would be.  Whatever, yeah.  Oh, but they're on the clock.  It's very serious.  This fantasy football is very serious.  What about mid-season trading?  Do they trade with each other?  No. 
[01:35:30]  They can trade with each other, right?  I think so, yeah.  And this money.  Would you take Wes Welker for Miles Austin for this week?  I bet they're real serious.  But some of these guys.  Imagine getting that phone call from your friend.  I would never call Jim.  I'd go, Jim, would you take Wes Welker this week?  I don't think he's going to do good against the Steelers defense.  I'll take your Miles Austin.  I wouldn't know what you were talking about.  Exactly.  I'd be like, who are these people?  Exactly, because you're a fucking man.  Exactly.  But they pay for a lot of money, too.  Play, excuse me. 
[01:36:00]  There's a lot of money at stake.  Jesus.  They throw in a few hundred bucks each or whatever it is.  I got no problem.  Get office football pool.  You got the free suicide pool where you pick the shitty team.  All of that stuff.  That's fine.  That's degenerate gambling.  Yeah.  Or, yeah, just a thing.  But this is just nonsense.  Now, these guys feel like they should give a press conference after Sunday.  They're like, yeah, well, my guys played really hard this weekend.  It just makes watching on Sunday fun.  That's not fun.  You watch your computer to see how your team's doing. 
[01:36:30]  You watch the screen.  You brought a fucking $3,000 TV with surround sound.  You're looking at your fucking laptop.  What did Calvin Johnson?  Did he just catch?  Oh, he did it.  He's got two catches for eight yards.  It's 108.  Fuck.  We're only four minutes into the game.  He's got to do better.  You don't want to hear that?  But then during the week, like, let's say my team's playing your team, me and you get  to trash talk and text each other and email.  We got bragging rights.  We got bragging rights.  And some leagues have a message board so the trash talking gets a little crazy and everyone 
[01:37:00]  can see it.  Oh, yeah.  Let me go to the message.  Let's see what they're saying.  That Jet Giant game, like the third game in the preseason.  They always go, it's for bragging rights.  It's a preseason game.  Of course.  What the fuck are you bragging about?  Hey, we beat you in preseason.  Yeah, the teams don't give a fuck.  When you didn't even play the starters, yeah, all right, you got me there, but we'll get  you next year.  You don't like bragging rights?  The teams don't give a fuck.  They're bragging.  We got bragging rights.  They won't even remember that.  We beat you. 
[01:37:30]  Hey, if it's a regular season game, hey, we kicked your ass last week, so you can't  say, I can understand that.  There's no bragging rights.  Yeah, they don't give a fuck.  In the end, they'll barely remember they played for a New York team.  They don't give a fuck.  You want to talk to some of these guys?  Yes, although a lot of people agree with you.  Of course.  Of course they are.  Backing up quarantine, fantasy football is gay.  I want to hear from the guys that are in this.  You're out there.  There are some.  Some.  It's fucking huge.  And I swear I'm not in the league.  I just know a lot about it.  What are the names in the league?  Most of the guys don't listen to the show that are into it, because a lot of men listen 
[01:38:00]  to the show.  A lot of guys, guys.  Guys that are just guys.  Real men.  They get a fucking 12-pack on Friday as soon as I get off of work and just start drinking and  watching porn.  And none of those guys watch fucking fantasy football.  Whoever's the asshole screening, we don't need people backing up Florentine.  That's easy.  Oh, boy.  That's easy.  Who's screening?  Who's screening?  Is it puppet hair?  I told him to find the people against it.  Okay, who?  Who?  That's one of our new interns.  That's what?  What's his name? 
[01:38:30]  How is it that an intern gets to answer phones for his first radio show on his first day?  His first day.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Where's the radio wizard when we need him?  Is he the one that was avoiding eye contact this morning?  That was funny.  I don't know.  I walked in the door.  He just looked down.  I like that.  The radio wizard's got some shit to do today.  Yeah, he did.  We can't have interns answering the phone day one.  He doesn't even know what the fuck is going on yet.  He doesn't even know everyone's names.  Let's go to Brendan.  Brendan.  What's up, guys?  Hi, Brendan. 
[01:39:00]  Hi.  Yeah.  Miami football is not gay.  I don't know what you're smoking, Jim.  Ooh.  It gives you a reason to watch the games that your team isn't playing.  That's true.  I live in Detroit.  It gives you a reason to watch the stupid Jets or the stupid 49ers.  And with all my buddies living across the country, it gives us something to keep in touch with.  To your point.  You know, you stay together through fantasy football.  Yeah, right.  See, because you wouldn't talk to your buddies across the country without fantasy football.  Right.  So you only talk to them during the season. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah.  You got nothing else to talk.  Why don't you just watch football because you're a fan?  Go.  The Jets are playing the Giants.  Let me watch that game even though I don't like it.  And be a real guy and talk to your friends about pussy.  Yeah.  What's wrong with you?  That's right.  Money.  By the way, you're going to have to deal with Ron Bennington, Florentine.  I'm staying out of that one.  He fucking fantasy footballs his ass off.  Really?  Good luck with that.  Good luck with that.  This guy's been doing it for 10 years.  Do you want to talk to Pete?  10 years.  That's fine.  Yeah.  All right.  Let's go to Pete who's been doing fantasy football for 10 years.  I didn't even know they had fantasy football 10 years ago. 
[01:40:00]  Dude, I was confused 10 years ago and I found out that at that time they'd already had it  for like 10 years.  Really?  It's been around a long time.  I mean, if you grew up watching sports and you're a sports nut, you're a sports junkie,  whether it's football or baseball, whatever it is.  Right.  You have always, I mean, you can't deny it, Jim.  You've always thought about one day like, man, why do those guys make that trade?  You know, I would love to be in that.  No, never, never did. 
[01:40:30]  No, no, I never did.  No, there's only a couple of things that I do pretty good and I don't think I'm a GM  of a team.  I don't go, what the fuck did they do that for?  They're wrong because the trade is always right.  Nine times out of 10, it's right.  So I don't think that.  Miami.  Miami.  Okay.  Perfect.  Out of all the teams that you root for, okay, Miami, Balfons, you've never like wanted  to shake that cage and be like, what the fuck are you guys doing? 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, but I, but I can't.  You know what?  I like to shake that cage or two.  Yeah, but haven't you thought about like, why wouldn't you see that you see things a  little bit better?  Oh my God.  That's true.  No, I don't.  They're there every day.  I don't.  I'm just a fucking fan that watches on Sunday that reads a couple of articles.  I don't know what's really going on.  I have no idea.  They're the pros, not me.  I'm honest with you.  Football is easy.  I know people, I can't get into baseball because, well, I mean, as far as the fantasy  goes, because you're talking every day. 
[01:41:30]  You're, you're, I mean, why even, why even show up to work?  Because you have 12 people do what this fantasy baseball team is.  Almost once a week.  You know, you have a shit talk with your friends, just like, I'll be sad.  Hey, a little shit talk.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Got you last week.  Yeah.  I got you this week.  I don't know.  No, I'm telling you.  I don't know.  He's hurt.  He's not playing good.  Yeah, but his, his hammy's coming back strong.  Sometimes it gets personal, man.  You bring up some old dirt.  Maybe, you know, I'm the guy.  Oh, man.  Gotta get. 
[01:42:00]  Me and Jim are friends.  We'd never do that during the week.  No.  I don't know if his hammy's going to be ready for Sunday.  No.  That is true.  Never wants to be upset to each other.  You're in trouble this weekend.  I don't know.  Never.  I see that Jim was in Detroit, Cleveland the week.  I text on Monday.  How many loads did you drop?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what, that's, that's what I don't know.  How is Walker's hammy?  Yeah, it's kind of fun of trash talk, though.  I mean, when you do a good job or, or you're in a league, hey, dude, 15 grand, you don't 
[01:42:30]  have a chance to win 15 grand to watch the ball.  Come on.  Gambling is fine.  Yeah, man.  The gambling is fine.  In the end, you can win some good money.  And, and, I forgot to mention one other thing, the trophy.  Oh, man.  That you get to keep for the year.  What is it?  Pete, have you won a trophy?  Pete, have you won the trophy yet?  The seat with a fist on it.  Some of these guys really get into their trophy.  Pete, have you won a trophy?  And then they got bragging rights, so when you go to your friend's house, there's the 
[01:43:00]  fantasy football trophy until next year.  Oh, so he's sitting in an easy chair because he's going to be an armchair quarterback.  I get it.  I've won it once.  I've won it once.  I've won it once like six years ago.  Hold on.  I want to know.  Did you win the trophy?  Uh, because no, there's no trophy.  Do I want that money?  All right.  But a lot of guys, they have the money and the trophy.  Oh, look at these two fucking assholes.  Oh, I know.  Hey, man.  We're talking to our base right now.  I got to defend fantasy football.  We're talking to our base. 
[01:43:30]  So you didn't win a trophy, though?  No.  I want the trophy.  Do you know what?  Give me a trophy.  Don't put it on.  See, all right.  He's cool, at least.  He didn't have to fucking.  He's so cool.  He didn't have to bring the trophy home to his house for a year.  Oh, you only get it for a year, and then you got to give it back?  All right.  Listen, I got to give someone else a chance, because now the phones are lit.  Chris, Florentine hates fantasy football.  I personally think it's great.  Jim, you talk all that shit, but you sit around and do the same shit every fucking day.  He does.  Like what?  Word.  Because when you sit around and talk about who's going to do what, what team is going to do well, 
[01:44:00]  what team is not going to do well, you're doing the same shit we're doing playing fantasy football.  The only difference is we're going to make money at the end of the season.  If you're doing fantasy football for free, that I don't understand.  I'm not doing fantasy football for free.  I don't have a guy on an opposing team that I hate.  I don't have their receiver.  I don't have Tom Brady as a quarterback.  I want him fucking dead every week.  You sit there every week and pontificate how well Tom Brady's going to do.  No, I don't.  No, I don't.  I just root against every team that I don't like. 
[01:44:30]  That's all I do.  You just listed out five teams you thought were going to make it to the Super Bowl.  You just listed out that the Jets weren't going to do any good.  It's no different.  You're stating your opinion, and then you're making money on it.  He's just his opinion on who he thinks is going to win or not.  It's not this technical, serious, oh, man, my guy's injured.  Everybody goes through that.  What's the name of your team there, Chris?  I'm a Skins fan all day, so fuck Dallas.  No, I mean, what's the name of your fantasy football team?  Oh, the Frederick Bontons. 
[01:45:00]  What is that?  Come on.  I don't know.  In the area I live, and I'm a Jamaican, so.  And what's, do you win a trophy at the end if you win the whole thing?  Hell yeah, because we shove that shit in each other's face.  That's the shit talking we do.  See?  And then when you go to that guy's house for a barbecue, there's that fucking fantasy football trophy staring in the eye.  Everybody comes to the fucking house for the barbecue.  Hey, look.  If it keeps him off the street.  Everybody's got to pay us their money on the spot.  That's right.  There's nothing wrong with fantasy football.  So, Jim, you don't like that when they start razzing each other? 
[01:45:30]  Like, ah, look at my trophy.  Oh, yeah, look.  Oh, come on.  He put it right on top of the fucking barbecue.  He had to do that as soon as we walked in.  You got me.  All right, so you're a Skins fan, right?  All right, so.  You know football better than some of your friends.  It ain't no difference.  All you're talking about is that you know football better than your friends.  I don't know.  I'm just guessing.  I don't know.  But, all right, so you're a Skins fan.  So if you have Tony Romo on your team one week, are you going to root for him?  I would never pick Tony Romo on my team.  All right, but what if you have to?  You have no choice because your quarterback is out. 
[01:46:00]  All right, I'm going to explain that to you because you said something very interesting.  You can be a fan of football, and you can also be a fan of a team.  So when your team is not playing, do you not watch football at all?  I watch it at all, absolutely, but I'm saying you're arch rival.  It's another game, right?  And then you kind of get interested in the other game.  It's no different.  When you're rooting for your team, you're rooting for your team.  But when you're rooting for football, you're watching other stuff happen.  It's no different.  All right, let me ask you something.  Say you get a Cowboy on your roster.  Say eight of your guys are injured on your fantasy football team. 
[01:46:30]  You have to take Miles Austin, okay?  Are you going to root for Miles Austin, an arch rival on the Cowboys, to score three touchdowns?  Here's what you do.  You root for the bend, but don't break.  Let that motherfucker score all the points, but your team still wins.  No, see, you don't know.  That's not a real fan.  A real fan wants him catching no passes, no matter what.  Breaking a leg.  A real fan wants his team to win, right?  No, you don't want Miles, you're not going to sit there and go, I'm glad he caught a 50-yard pass.  That's good.  All right, so he scored instead of, no. 
[01:47:00]  Two touchdowns, and my team still wins.  What did it hurt?  Nothing.  You want Dallas to lose 37-0 every week.  As a Redskins fan, that's what you want.  You don't want him to catch that.  Absolutely.  That's bad sportsmanship.  My Austin catches three touchdowns, and my team scores 100 touchdowns.  That's all I want.  I want them to lose.  And Chris, logically, you're making a lot of sense, because in the end, you got that fucking  trophy for bragging rights.  Thank you.  There you go.  See, I understand.  You guys razz each other.  Give each other the business.  During the week, though, Jimmy, during the week. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah.  Sunday, it's all business.  You just focus on that computer and see how your team's doing.  I don't know.  I think that guy changed his mind over here.  Yeah, I think he's got me.  Next week, you're going to be saying, I got this guy.  Yeah.  I was totally wrong about it.  Let's go to Boston.  Mikey.  Good morning.  Hi, Mike.  What's happening, guys?  Fantasy football doesn't have to be friggin' like you guys are saying.  I set my lineup Sunday morning.  I friggin' spend my day doing whatever.  Walked in the afternoon, and that's friggin' it. 
[01:48:00]  Why do you send your lineup?  Set.  You guys set it.  Send your lineup.  Because you have to decide who you want to put in.  Oh, he's just going to start.  You might have some inside info that someone's hammy's a little fucking sore, so you might  fucking...  I'm hammy.  You wouldn't want to pick teams?  No.  You don't?  Oh.  Why, man?  Because then someone picks your guy before you.  Now you've got to fucking use your brain to figure it out on the spot.  How can they pick your guy if he's on your team?  No.  I mean, if someone gets to the guy you wanted before you.  That's what makes this whole thing complicated.  Yeah, let's see if it was...  We can put it in terms you'll understand, like fantasy radio, let's say. 
[01:48:30]  No.  You'd need to replace Travis with somebody today.  Yes.  See?  Yeah.  So you've got to set your lineup.  Yep.  Also, I brought home a friggin' grand last year.  Oh.  Just friggin' hitting a button saying set lineup every Sunday.  The system sets your best lineup as what it thinks.  All right.  We get it.  We get that.  We get all that, Mike.  But I need to know, what's the name of your team?  Two Teams, One Ball. 
[01:49:00]  Two Teams, One Ball.  How good is that?  It's like a two girls one.  We got it.  We got it.  And then what's the name of the league?  Yes.  It's Brawl Done Loud, which is a compilation of last names from my family, because it's  all my family playing.  This is very serious shit.  Ah, kids are family together.  Florentine.  So it's only family that's in the...  Ah, that's nice.  Sometimes you do just only family if you've got a big family.  I wish they'd play against the Corleones.  Sometimes you do your frat brothers.  Sometimes you do your college buddies.  Do you guys rip each other to family during the week?  Yeah. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, absolutely.  Family parties.  You know, we friggin' hang out.  My drafts is nothing more than my family hanging out, pounding beers.  Ah, pounding them beers.  You can understand pounding beers, right?  You know, we'll reach around, you know, whoever wins.  Sure, sure.  And do you get a trophy at the end of the year?  No.  You get a friggin' thousand dollar check.  All right.  That's where, you know, that's where they draw the line.  No trophy.  All right.  They put a little manliness into it with no trophy.  A little bit.  Why don't you guys get the armchair trophy? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah, that's a good one.  Hey, we're not all into it like, yeah, fantasy football.  Well, most of us just friggin' look at our lineup like 10 minutes during the week.  We friggin' most of us just hit a button and the computer system just says, hey, this  is your friggin' most probable lineup to win this week.  Oh, great.  So you're not even picking a good fill.  So you're not even doing it.  The computer's doing it.  Well, you can.  No, you got to set your team.  We learned that.  Yeah, but the computer's saying he's hitting the button and it's telling him what, yeah,  pretty much what his lineup should be.  That's pretty good.  What is that, like Farmville? 
[01:50:30]  All right, I tell you, I got to go to Ben in Jersey.  Ben.  Yeah, I think I know why Jim doesn't like fantasy football when he was younger.  I think he was part of another fantasy with wrestling pictures.  They had a little draft in the street.  Say, you understand getting into something?  There wasn't even a draft.  We went right for it.  Yeah.  No, absolutely.  I was into gay wrestling, but this fantasy football is just ridiculous.  I didn't spend time fucking drafting wrestlers.  I didn't have Ernie Ladd and Hulk Hogan on my team, but I fucking traded Bob Backlund because 
[01:51:00]  he had a bad back.  Why would you get rid of Bob Backlund?  Fantasy wrestling.  He was the fucking worst Bob Backlund.  I loved him.  He wrote fan fiction.  He was what a bore he was.  He was a fucking bore.  He was my favorite.  He would do the knee walk.  You didn't like the knee walk?  You didn't like that?  He did that little curly thing with his face.  He put his hands over his face.  Did he?  I don't remember that.  Yeah, it's terrible.  Oh, yeah.  You don't think he was exciting when he talked?  No, and he was a bad wrestler.  He was awful.  He had no moves.  The knee walk. 
[01:51:30]  Is that his...  Oh, he loves that.  I hate people online.  You want more of these or are we done?  Fan the Cleveland Browns.  Look, you should never bring your laptop to a sports bar.  How about this?  You shouldn't be sitting there with your iPad looking at stats when there's 18 games going  on.  Steve's got you, though, man.  I think he's got an angle on this.  Go ahead, Steve.  Morning, boys.  Hey, Jim, the bottom line is I'm a Browns fan, been a Browns fan since I was a kid in  the late 70s, and they suck. 
[01:52:00]  So if it wasn't for fantasy football, I wouldn't have nothing to watch after three weeks, because  they'd be done.  There you go.  He does have a little point there.  Your Browns do suck.  Maybe you could just get in an office pool and pick spreads each week.  Yeah.  So then you can have a vested interest in each game.  Really?  Why not just gamble on the fucking games?  Well, I actually have a buddy of mine who does a very interesting pool.  Every game that's on primetime, you pick the winner straight up.  And that last year was five bucks to get in, and last year, the winner one took home 
[01:52:30]  for 1,300 bucks.  I wouldn't classify that as very interesting.  Very.  No, you wouldn't?  These guys.  Would you say, like, super unbelievable interesting, then?  My friend's a meat-and-potato idiot, too.  But these guys, you know, they win the league.  They're taking home a grand or more.  Oh, wait.  Did you see this trophy?  Oh, no.  This fantasy football.  It's like the pose in the Heisman, but they got a remote in their hand.  The guy's holding the remote.  Well, that's kind of clever.  Hey, Steve, what's the name of your team?  The KY Bikes, or KY Dogs, because I live in Kentucky now, and I'm still a Browns fan. 
[01:53:00]  The Kentucky Dogs.  Nice.  Hey, KY Dogs.  Clever.  What's the name of the league?  Half the league's in Virginia Beach, so we're the KY, VB, MAC 3 League, because we've had  drama.  That's catchy.  Wait, you had drama?  Oh, yeah.  People train guys at the end of the season, so their buddy wins.  Oh, that's great.  Oh, man.  See, then it's cheating.  See, then it's not fun anymore.  No, that pisses off everybody else, and now it's major beef. 
[01:53:30]  What's drama?  Some friends.  Yeah, so then you guys don't even have time to rib each other during the week,  if that drama's going on.  That's an interesting story.  And then the worst part is I'm a commissioner, so I've got to do the right thing for everybody,  but you end up winning the league.  The right thing for everybody.  You're the law, then.  If you said, I have to do the right thing for everybody, that should be followed with a  gunshot.  I forgot.  Every league has a commissioner.  Oh, there's a commissioner.  You're a commissioner.  And sometimes you've got to argue your case with the commissioner, which is also your best pal. 
[01:54:00]  Now do you guys get my point?  For everybody.  What?  There should be a commissioner.  Commishkit.com.  Yeah, they've got kits and everything, so you do it properly.  Commishkit?  Where have you guys been?  Fantasy football is massively huge.  Very involved.  Did you go to the commishkit, sir, honestly?  No, I've been doing it for years.  But why do you think they have the red zone in the NFL?  Can I ask you, hold on, as the commissioner, what was your toughest decision you had to  fucking toil over?  Well, my wife's in the league, and we made a trade four years ago, and everybody said 
[01:54:30]  it was a bogus trade, but I...  She traded you for a black gentleman?  You hear this, though?  See, she made a...  Well, it could have been an illegal trade, Florentine.  Four years ago, and they're still talking about it.  There's a website called commishkit.com, I guess, where you get your fucking commit.  Yeah, your commishkit.  But they have a shirt, they saw a shirt in there, it says, beer, can't draft without  it, and they show a mug of draft beer.  All right, so now, does everybody get what I'm saying? 
[01:55:00]  That's funny, though.  I'd laugh if I saw that, like, ah, I get it.  What's wrong with keeping it fun, Florentine?  Yeah, what's wrong?  What's fun about that?  What's wrong with just keeping it fun?  What is fucking fun about that?  It just shows you've been beer-drinking cool guys.  You know what's fun?  They're out, having a good time.  You know what's fun?  A party at Anthony's on the weekend.  That's fucking fun.  There you go.  Yeah, right?  Not a fucking...  Not a trophy of a guy sitting in an armchair.  But not everyone could go to Anthony's parties.  Yeah, but that's fun.  Now what do you got?  Now what do you got?  You could do something else, but not that. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, man.  Anything else there, Steve?  Nah, bro, I love you guys.  Love you, Jim on KMS.  Hey, commissioner.  Commissioner.  And I love fantasy football.  Thanks for calling, commissioner.  She earned that title.  So, KMS, all right, hey, I hope you have a, you know...  Yeah.  Is there any bounties in fantasy football you have to deal with, KMS?  Yeah.  What about using steroids?  Have you come out either way on that?  One more.  Let's go back to Ohio, because they're hurting up there.  So they get two today.  Two phone calls from Ohio.  Tommy...  Here's the draft room. 
[01:56:00]  The picture of the draft room.  Look at that.  The commish stands up in front of everyone.  Everyone's on their couches.  He's there.  You got the big fucking draft board behind the guy.  Yeah, you do.  And then he keeps...  It looks awful.  Why?  He's got to keep it organized.  I'd rather be in Amon Gertz's living room.  Yes.  I'd rather be in the draft in Vietnam.  And you could have been.  I think in this shot, it's very obvious this league has decided that you've got to bring 
[01:56:30]  your stats with you.  No laptops.  Look, there's...  No laptops.  Look, they all have paperwork.  There's a picture online with like 20 people in a room with a board.  And there's like four girls there.  There's like four chicks, and none of the chicks are over a four.  Because hot chicks are out doing fun things.  Let's say hi to Tommy in Ohio.  Tommy, fantasy football.  What do you got?  Yeah, I'm in a league.  I'm for it.  But some of the guys in my league, they get absolutely goofy with it. 
[01:57:00]  I mean, they...  Like, I'll pick up a magazine the day of the draft and pick through my players and stuff.  But some of these guys, they get magazines literally like six, seven times a month.  You do know there's fantasy football magazines, right?  No, I didn't know.  Magazines, too.  Oh, yeah, there are.  Yeah, they have huge...  I mean, there's tons of magazines on there.  What, black inches?  Honcho.  They get goofy with it.  And it...  I mean, it's fun.  It's not fun.  Is that fun?  That picture? 
[01:57:30]  There's a picture online of a draft.  That looks fucking terrible.  Does that look fun?  It's terrible.  Look, they pulled the curtains.  It's gotta be all...  No distractions from outside.  We rented out the back room at Applebee's.  And we put the curtain up so we have some privacy.  Yeah.  For our fucking...  Here we are.  Look at that.  They're all staring into the laptops.  It's like...  Yeah, look at that.  They fucking got a big board in front of them.  They got mozzarella sticks out.  Oh, yeah.  Party and some brewskis.  Hey, let's order some apps.  Let's get some apps.  Before we start the draft.  Chicken wings. 
[01:58:00]  What kind of apps do you want?  Let's just get a lot for everyone.  Yeah, let's just get...  Yeah, can we just get the whole...  The general app thing?  Yeah.  Some of these guys...  The sample size?  And just keep bringing the brewskis.  Yeah, bring the...  Yeah.  Look, some of the guys, they get it catered.  You got any IPAs?  Because I don't drink Coronas.  Some of them get them catered.  Sometimes the wives, if they're not involved with the fantasy football, they'll fucking cook  some fucking dishes and bring them over.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, bring the wives over.  That's great.  And they'll hang out in the backyard or whatever and check on the guys there once in a while.  How's it going? 
[01:58:30]  How's it going?  You guys behaving out here?  Yeah, what round the end?  We're in the fourth.  Oh, this is going to take forever.  Oh, God.  Don't you have to get up for your job tomorrow?  No, but come on, honey.  All right, guys.  That fucking room looks like the class you have to take after a D-week.  Who wants to sit there?  That's telling.  The guy that runs our league, his wife is the only one that's in it.  And she'll cook and stuff.  But she's in the league, too.  What's the name of your team?  Uh, Tominators. 
[01:59:00]  What?  Tominators.  The Tominators.  Is your name Tom?  Hey, the Tominators doing pretty good.  Look out.  Why the Tominators?  I don't know.  I just, I've been in the league about five years and I just picked something.  He's embarrassed.  Is your name Tom?  Yeah.  So you, like, your name is Tom and you called your name the Tominators?  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I used to call myself the Opster.  What's wrong with that?  What's wrong with that?  You should have called them the Tuck Suckers. 
[01:59:30]  You don't like the Tominators?  I despise it.  No, you don't like that?  I've never hated anything more.  I like the name Al-Qaeda more than fucking the Tominators.  Oh, the Tominators.  What's the name of the league there, Tom?  Balls Deep 1.  See?  That's a cool fucking face.  I like the name.  Balls Deep.  I'll give them that.  And do you guys get a trophy at the end?  No, no trophy.  Just money.  And how much?  I think it's, it's only like 200 for first place.  What the fuck? 
[02:00:00]  200.  A waste of time.  Jesus Christ.  It's Ohio.  They're suffering up there.  Why are you making fun of that?  I'm not making that 200 bucks.  Have you been up there lately?  There's no jobs.  Yeah, but Jesus, 200 bucks.  You playing with people from the fucking sedan?  How much does it cost to get in?  A dollar?  Nah, it's like 15 or something.  Yeah, man.  It's just for fun.  Who's the commissioner?  Who's the commissioner?  No, his wife.  He already said that.  Oh, she's the commissioner?  No, she cooks.  She's the cook.  Oh, what?  She cooks.  Yeah, the wife cooks.  We don't really have a cook.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No commissioner. 
[02:00:30]  So what happens if some drama goes down?  If there's a trade that, you know, who handles that?  What we do is, it's like online, like everyone has to vote if they accept the trade.  Like say I want to trade with somebody, everybody in the league would have to agree with it.  Oh, so they can't just be trading willy-nilly.  That'd be great, getting phone calls out of nowhere if you agree with a trade.  You got a chick over, you know what I mean?  Oh, wait.  I just got an email.  I got approved as trade. 
[02:01:00]  Cominator wants Wes Walker.  Hold on, honey.  Cominator.  You know, Sam, remember when I said only a mere five minutes ago, we don't need people  that are agreeing with Florentine?  Yeah.  So why are there still phone calls coming in when agreeing with him?  He's a new guy.  He's a new guy.  And I thought you were quitting.  Yeah, you're off.  How are you ahead of the intern still?  How are you still ahead of, yeah.  What did I say?  I came back and it was given back to me. 
[02:01:30]  What?  You never gave it away.  I was quitting.  You were quitting.  When you quit, you can't get it back.  You don't get the job back.  You say, I'm quitting.  Exactly.  Where's the radio wizard?  We've got issues today.  Wizard.  All right, can you tell the new intern that has no business being on the phones day one  to remember what we just said?  We don't need those calls.  Yeah.  Does he seem like he's going to be a standout intern there, Ira?  This is the second intern on the phones.  Yeah, why would you? 
[02:02:00]  And the first one was a disaster.  Why not put number two on there?  What else do I have to answer the question?  Sal.  How about fucking puppet hair?  Where's Sal?  What's he doing?  Man, you're Sal.  Why not?  Every time.  Every.  What is he doing right now?  He's cutting up other audio.  That's not more important than the live show, you fucking Dunderhead.  I love Dunderhead.  It's my team's name, the Dunderheads.  The Dominators.  The Dominators.  The Gymnasiums are playing.  Fucking boom.  Remember the days when Sal would run down the hall and now he just moseys? 
[02:02:30]  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't care anymore.  What happens to people when they get hired?  He's tripping on his marionette strings.  His marionette.  His floppy legs of nothing but cloth with big wooden feet.  Are you guys mad at E-Rock?  E-Rockinator?  E-Rockinator.  Sal, what are you doing?  I was putting together some stuff for the weekend.  For the weekend?  It's Tuesday.  It's because I got to do promos for it.  I got to do all this stuff.  It's got to get approved.  I got to talk to the radio wizard.  My team's name is Sal of the Border.  Clever.  We're the Salivators. 
[02:03:00]  We're Salivators.  We can't wait for Sunday.  That's why we're the Salivators.  We're Salivating.  We're the Salamanders.  Sal, if you don't mind, we need you to work today.  If you don't mind.  I know most people don't need to work around here, but we need you to work today and do  the phones.  We realize you were-  Especially when it's a hot topic.  This is called a hot topic.  We realize you were having your hair modeled for an Anson Williams wig.  Because E-Rock's not listening. 
[02:03:30]  He still has interns.  We'll do the most.  We're doing exactly what we don't want.  Every call here says they don't like fantasy football, so one guy gets through and it means  the interns-  I have, I-  All right.  You challenged me.  Okay.  Line three, I hate fantasy football.  Telecasts have live tickets of fantasy football updates.  And then mirror the next line, line four, I hate fantasy football.  There's two right there.  So what are you doing in the re-arc besides fucking having a good time and laughing?  It's like it's his house.  Yeah, stop back and look at your house.  You want one more?  We got a guy that's been doing it since 97. 
[02:04:00]  And, uh-  Anson Williams.  Well, we've done it, I guess.  You want a guy from 97?  Oh, I want another one.  Yeah, yeah.  I love these guys.  Oh, please.  And this guy doesn't have a favorite team, so he does fantasy football.  Hey, come on.  You also got to remember, there's a lot of fucking people out there that don't have a team in  their city.  Who?  No, but they still have favorite teams.  Yeah, they picked a close one.  What if you live in Montana?  Who do you fucking root for?  Eh, the Vikings.  Whoever has the most white people, I guess.  I don't even know the closest team to Montana.  I wouldn't even know. 
[02:04:30]  I would say you'd go Vikings.  Denver, maybe?  I think you'd go.  I don't know.  That's up there.  Or Seattle.  You know, to be honest, I don't even know if I could point.  Or Minnesota.  I don't even know if I could show you Montana on a map.  It's up to the left there.  Somewhere, it's right?  I'm going to go near the Dakotas.  I'm going to go left center.  Left center-ish?  Yeah.  It's a big motherfucking state.  I know that much.  Give you that.  Seven people live there.  All right, let's say out of Brandon in Tennessee.  Brandon?  Yo, happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thanks.  I've been doing this since 97. 
[02:05:00]  I actually got into it when I was 14.  I had a group of my guys just walked into the room one day, and they were like, hey, we're  doing fantasy football.  You want in?  And I was like, bye.  That's what they told you they were doing?  Did you ask why there was a cracker on the floor?  Fantasy football.  You had to lay there with your mouth open while I called you Michael Strahan.  When I was 14, the guy with the wrestling pictures did that to me, too.  Yeah, see?  Yep.  Hey, we're having a wrestling draft in here.  Come on in.  Yeah, it's a draft.  We all sit in a circle.  Yeah, we all open our pants, and we reach in and grab the fucking magic team picker and 
[02:05:30]  put it in our mouths.  By the way, we're looking at the map.  Montana is supposed to be two states.  Look at Montana.  That's supposed to be two states.  Wyoming's western border should have went straight up to Canada and cut Montana in half.  Yeah, what's that?  Is that a river that looks like a face?  Coming down Ohio?  It looks like a profile.  No, I don't think it is.  Cartoon profile.  It's not?  So why?  It's all wiggly on the left side.  Well, they all made them wiggly lines. 
[02:06:00]  They all made them wiggly lines.  Montana could easily be cut into two states.  I like how the United States got all fucking like, all right, enough with cutting these  states up so small as we went west.  Yeah, no kidding.  It was like New England and stuff with the first few states.  It's like all very small.  No, we got to cut it up.  And then they got all this land.  They're like, ah, fuck it.  Yeah, fuck it.  There should be so many more states.  Yeah.  Whatever.  What do you got there, Brandon?  You've been playing fantasy football since 97.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's kind of like what a lot of the couple of other guys said, too. 
[02:06:30]  I mean, it's just, I mean, one day a week, you sit around, you know, you kick it with  your boys, watch some games, talk some shit.  Kick it with your boys?  You're all watching games with your laptops out?  Oh, no.  Hell no.  I don't know.  I don't sit around and watch it with my laptop on or anything like that.  Because they got the fantasy football apps, let's not forget.  What's your name?  What's the name of your team?  Oh, yeah.  My team name, actually, Uncle Paul would love it.  It's Sandusky hurt my tight end.  All right.  Oh, tight end joke.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, but what was your name before that? 
[02:07:00]  It wasn't your name since 97.  Right.  I mean, I've kind of just played on words throughout the years and stuff.  Call me the cruiser.  Well, give me one example.  I'll see another one I've done.  I'll see Jones Drew Bush on my Johnson.  Uh, see, I mean, it's a lot of play on words and stuff like that.  Oh, yeah.  What was the one right before the Sandusky one?  Uh, before the Sandusky one?  Yeah.  Uh, being a Cowboy fan, uh, Romo no homo. 
[02:07:30]  Here's a play on words.  Ilk yourself.  What the fuck?  It's just blown off steam, guys.  Come on.  Wait, what was it?  Romo what?  Romo no homo.  Romo no homo.  See, that's clever.  Sticks.  See?  It's not bad.  It's hideous.  It's just blown off steam, man.  What's the name in a league?  Uh, just, I mean, just basic head-to-head league is what it's called.  Just head-to-head matchups every week against different guys in a league.  I mean, we don't go balls out and name a crazy league name. 
[02:08:00]  Oh, yeah, that's silly.  Are you the commissioner?  No, no.  No.  Who's the commish?  Uh, a friend of mine.  Oh, you know the commissioner.  That's pretty good.  He's been running it since, I think, like, 95.  Oh, yeah, man.  Do you ever get mad at him because he makes a decision that you don't like, and it affects  your friendship?  Oh, do you guys make, and do you guys make t-shirts every year?  Uh, actually, the first couple of years, I did do t-shirts for it.  Oh.  Oh.  Did you wear them every Sunday?  Oh, you guys wore them? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  No, no, not at all.  Look, man.  Come on.  The t-shirt.  Yeah, he wore them.  He went out to the bar with them, and somebody would, like, be next to him getting a beer  and go, hey, fantasy football?  Yeah, yeah, man.  And they'd get into a big conversation about it.  But the t-shirt's important.  You don't know what you're going to do.  You know, and there's a lot of discussion.  What are we going to do for the t-shirt this year?  Oh, yeah.  Are we going to focus on one guy in the league, maybe?  Is that everybody involved in that, or do you think the commish has a lot to say over  what the t-shirt's going to look like?  Majority.  Majority rules on the t-shirt.  I'm thinking big cock and balls. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah.  Let's just have assholes on the t-shirt.  Perfect.  Just open, gaping assholes.  There's a lot of discussion on the t-shirt during the off-season.  Yeah, I know.  Right?  People throw their ideas in a hat, and then they fucking figure something out.  All those t-shirts should look like fucking Kennedy's after he came out of the limo.  Oh, shit, man.  Gaping assholes. 
[02:09:30]  Perfect.  All right, Brandon.  What a bunch of dolts.  Is that another picture of the fantasy?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Look at him.  Hey, um.  Laptop.  Buffalo Wild Wings.  Sam.  Oh, yeah.  Sam.  They all got them plugged in, their laptops at the table.  And they're writing, too.  They got, like, clipboards and fucking legal pads.  One guy's got a football batting helmet.  You see that at the end of the table there?  Oh, yeah.  He wears that every Sunday.  He wears that when he does his picks.  He's the fun guy. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah.  He's got that one fun guy.  More importantly, Sam, remember when I told you twice that we don't need any phone calls?  Oh, no.  Because it's easy to put guys on that are going to defend Florentine, but he can defend himself.  That's why you don't need those calls when you do a radio show.  Sal can't be bad at phone screening, too.  E-Rock, remember?  Yes.  So what happened this time?  I got a guy who says, fantasy football is Dungeon and Dragons for insecure men.  That would be someone defending Jim Florentine's point of view, something we really don't need right now.  Oh, gosh. 
[02:10:30]  This would be the third time in a mere 15 minutes.  So what happened?  Didn't Sal hear your instructions because he was lacquering his hair?  Did you forget to give him instructions?  No.  Everyone knows.  I mean, theoretically, Sal should have also been listening to this show.  Wait.  Sal's arguing in the background.  Sal, did E-Rock tell you?  He told me one thing, and then when I got in here, he tells me another thing.  What did he tell you?  What did he tell you the first time?  I don't even remember.  He said, we want four fantasy football.  I can't remember.  Thank God we're really good at doing radio.  You don't remember what he told you? 
[02:11:00]  It was two minutes ago.  All you got is yourselves.  We really just have ourselves.  Sal, what do you mean you don't remember?  I'm confused if you guys want four fantasy football or a dance show.  Do you listen to the show?  I am, but Eric told me one thing when we got in.  No, well, you listened to the show before you now was asked to answer the phone.  Yeah, yeah, I was.  No, he wasn't.  How would you cut enough audio for the weekend if you were listening to the show?  I do multitask.  Okay.  There's no fucking way he was listening to the show.  I know that Jim doesn't like the fantasy football league.  You think it's retarded, and I understand that.  But I don't know if you currently want those calls or you don't want them. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, my God!  He wasn't listening.  You weren't listening.  You weren't listening.  He took the overarching theme of the last 40 minutes.  Right.  He was like, yeah, I was listening to the whole thing.  All right, we all know Sal's stupid, but I got to go back to E-Rock.  Sal, did E-Rock tell you not to put those phone calls through?  He told me one thing when I initially got here, and he told me another thing.  What did he tell you when you got there?  I think he said he wanted it for.  When did you say that, E-Rock, when he walked in?  Yeah, when he walked in.  Why would you have said he wanted it for when the two interns that we fucking, oh, I see 
[02:12:00]  what you're saying.  Okay, then what did you tell him that was different?  No, I think when he walked in, he said against, and then go, oh, no, no, for fantasy football.  Oh, no.  But for fantasy...  Yeah, for fantasy football, I'll be right.  Right.  I thought you meant for Florentine.  Okay.  No, not for Florentine.  All right.  So are you wrong or Sal's wrong?  He wasn't listening.  I'm on the air.  Don't yell.  So answer that question.  Well, I didn't hear your question. 
[02:12:30]  I'm telling you to shut up.  We just said the question.  And by the way, we said the question before he pulled his headphones off and yelled at  Sal.  For the record.  I didn't yell at Sal.  What did you say to him?  I wasn't yelling at Sal.  I was yelling at one of the interns.  Why is Pipette Hair putting these calls through?  I don't fucking know.  I don't know what to tell you.  And now Eric and Sal are standing there at the window, and I just heard one of the interns  pick up the phones and screen it again.  Who's answering the phone? 
[02:13:00]  Somebody jumped back on the phones when Sal got on the mic.  Who?  One of the interns.  I don't want to fuck the phones on their first day.  How do you lose control that fast?  You're not.  That's a catastrophe in that room.  And why are you still in charge of the interns if you quit?  What are you doing there?  Stop making hoagies.  Why are you in charge if you quit?  You said that you weren't going to do this job anymore.  It's a free job.  And the interns walk over to me to ask what to do.  But didn't you make it clear before you left for your summer vacation you were done with  the interns? 
[02:13:30]  I thought so.  No, you didn't, obviously.  I haven't spoke to management or anybody.  Spoken.  Spoken to management or anybody for like a week and a half.  But did you tell them, I'm no longer going to be in charge of the interns?  I thought Troy was taking it over.  How did you think?  But you didn't tell anyone.  And he didn't think Troy was taking over because Troy sent an email out.  I hate he rocks niceness.  Troy sent an email out before.  He's just a nice guy.  Then fucking fire everybody here then.  All right?  What?  No!  I'm saying.  You said you.  Troy, thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Nobody's good enough.  Thank you, Troy.  Thank you.  What in the hell would move?  Hold on.  Oh, man.  Fuck you.  Because I know what you're trying to do here.  That has nothing to do with anything else.  That's right.  The point is this.  And stay on point, asshole.  You said you were done with the interns and you were quitting.  Right.  And now we're day one back from summer vacation and you're still in charge of the interns.  That's the point here right now.  Not fire everyone because no one's good enough.  Yeah.  That has nothing to do with the argument at hand.  Troy Kwan. 
[02:14:30]  What the hell would make you think I was taking over the interns?  Right.  When I said, can Troy take over the interns?  Do.  To management.  I just asked if you could talk to management.  They said, well, Eric's gone.  You will be in charge of the interns for the one week.  And I also said about taking it away.  And you CC'd me on an email to somebody from HR.  Yes.  And Sam was there.  He saw this.  And I said, I'm only responsible from this day.  And Eric will be taking back over on this day.  Effective today.  That's not what I said in my email.  Yeah.  Do I report you the email?  No, I know what you wrote. 
[02:15:00]  But what I wrote to HR was saying that Troy,  he's taking over.  Why wouldn't you respond to anybody?  You didn't respond to anybody.  Did you tell me anything?  I went on vacation.  I didn't give two shits.  But you were still here when I responded.  Total lack of dedication.  I got your email and I responded literally three minutes later.  So why wouldn't you go, hey, whoa, whoa, hang on a second.  Or, hey, management, what's up with this?  Got a point.  Let them figure it out.  No, we were proud of you because you finally stepped up and said, I'm proud of him.  He didn't quit.  You egged me on into doing that.  Never quit.  Thank you, Sam.  He never told management.  No.  Thank you.  That's my point the whole fucking time here. 
[02:15:30]  E-Rock.  You never quit, E-Rock.  What the fuck do you care?  You're not in charge of him.  Neither are you.  They're running around luck in there.  No one else seems to be allowed to.  The reason why we care is because you finally said you had it and you were quitting.  That's the only reason I care right now.  Yeah.  And it turns out, and Sam has brought it to everyone's attention, you never quit.  I just got back.  I haven't talked to anybody but you guys since we got here.  He said he quit before.  But then Troy's email didn't answer. 
[02:16:00]  If he would have quit, why wouldn't management come to me and say, well, okay, starting on  Tuesday, you'll be taking over to the in-house.  Because he never went to manager.  Right.  That's true.  Are you quitting the free job or not?  E-Rock, comment.  Sure.  Fine.  Done.  Not doing this.  Oh.  I'm not putting up with this shit.  What?  He says that shit on the air, but then as soon as management comes down the hall, it's  a whole different story.  It is, right?  Completely different.  Right.  He's not quitting. 
[02:16:30]  Are you, if you're not quitting, then say you're not quitting.  Yeah, just say, if you like them looking up to you, that's fair.  No, I don't care.  I don't care on you.  Oh.  E-Rock?  Fun of words?  Comment.  Comment, E-Rock?  Comment?  So you're quitting the intern gig like you said you were going to before vacation?  He said he did.  He said he did, yes.  He said he did.  Damn.  That was the whole point here.  Yes.  E-Rock.  He's bringing other shit into it, whatever. 
[02:17:00]  But that's the whole point right now.  And he was trying to bullshit with his email.  That was a fucking total.  That's dirty.  It was.  Dirty?  Because he said, I'll be taking over.  And I said, no, no, no.  I clarified everything.  I said, no, I'm only looking over the interns for the week that he is away.  Eric will resume duties the second he gets back.  That's what the email said.  You saw it.  You were still here when you received it.  And you said nothing to management about that, E-Rock?  About Troy's email?  Yeah.  Why didn't you comment on it?  Why didn't you say, no, this isn't just for when I'm gone.  This is forever. 
[02:17:30]  I just didn't respond to it.  Why?  Because I didn't.  The email was sent.  But wouldn't that have made it clear that you didn't want to do the intern job anymore?  And didn't Troy's email make it clear that he didn't realize he was taking over full time?  Yeah.  So why wouldn't you respond to that and put that fire out immediately?  It's true.  I don't know.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, boy.  When does the Radio Wizard get here?  There's issues.  Let's leave Mr. Nagel's words up there for everyone to see. 
[02:18:00]  Right.  I don't know.  Troy's getting a nice fucking Hitler thing going.  Exactly.  That hair is fucking fantastic.  That fucking Boardwalk Empire look.  Yeah, yeah, right?  Yeah.  He has the Hitler at the Eagle's Nest hair.  When it was a little windy and he was kind of casual in the last time.  He was just watching Eva run around with the dog.  Looked all sexy.  So E-Rock's going to be in charge of the interns this semester? 
[02:18:30]  Of course he is.  Yeah, why wouldn't he?  Another semester of fucking...  It's pretty obvious.  ...interns not knowing what to do.  Running around amok.  So it was all bullshit when you said you had it with this shit.  Yeah.  You rock?  It wasn't bullshit that I didn't have it with this shit.  But, rip up.  But?  You're not getting fired from the company or the show.  You're just quitting a...  A duty.  A duty, thank you.  That you have to do for free.  You didn't get extra money for that?  No.  I feel like it's my fault. 
[02:19:00]  Yeah.  Because if I didn't bring this fantasy football thing up, I hated it.  It wouldn't have been a problem with the phone calls.  We were just talking shit.  No, but there's just no communication.  That room's all laughs.  All they're doing in there is having a bunch of laughs.  They're not...  You know, it's like Sal walks in there.  He doesn't know what to do.  Well, should...  Fucking poor intern.  It's not his fault.  Oh, he doesn't know any better at this point.  Should Travis sit down with the guys and sort this out today?  Yeah, get Travis in here.  Absolutely.  That's right.  He can sit down early next week because the first week of September, nothing's ever happening  in the radio show. 
[02:19:30]  We were always away this week, aren't we?  And the radio wizard's still not here.  He's here.  He's here.  You saw him?  I saw him in the back.  All right, tell him there's some problems he's got to get on.  He's got a no horseplay sign for that room right there.  Yeah, it's all...  Everybody's having a ball in there.  Yes.  Not a lot of work getting done.  Phew.  Fucking Sal doesn't know what to do.  He's like, I don't know.  Iraq tells me a bunch of things.  He didn't even know whether the calls...  He's screening the calls and had no clue whether we wanted calls that liked it or didn't  like it.  And the whole reason he was in there... 
[02:20:00]  Right.  ...is because the intern fucked up.  So we didn't have problems with the phones.  The intern fucked up, so they bring in Sal.  Then he goes in and he doesn't even get proper instructions, according to Sal.  Oh, my God.  But then while he's on the air, we hear in the back, hello, ONA, the intern just takes  over again.  And the intern's back on the phones.  This is ridiculous.  Iraq, comment.  No leadership in there.  Iraq, comment.  Leadership.  Why are you having fun like we are?  I wonder why.  Oh.  Why?  Why?  Isn't it that you don't think that you're above Sal to have him come in and do it? 
[02:20:30]  No.  So you think you could give a command to Sal?  I asked Sal earlier to come in because I thought I was going to need him on phones,  but intern number two was getting the hang of everything and he was doing fine.  How was he getting the hang of it?  What do you mean?  He was putting the right part to his mouth?  You were answering calls just fine for a while until one call got up there saying one.  By the way, before we started talking about fantasy football, I would guess there were  five phone calls that came in about just nonsense, dumb stuff. 
[02:21:00]  But technically, it is Sal's job.  He's the associate producer.  I mean, it is his job.  Yeah.  I don't know why he's always in the back.  He should be, when I was associate producer, I was sitting in front of the phones every day.  Oh, man.  Damn it.  That's going to leave a blue.  That's true.  Well, I mean, that's the truth.  Yeah.  Truth is the truth.  That's true.  Right, Eric?  All right.  Yeah, that is true.  That's what you were doing.  But I'm not Sal's direct boss.  Well, who does Sal answer to here when the executive producer's not here? 
[02:21:30]  Exactly.  Who's in charge of this?  What the hell's going on?  Wait, the operation would have ran a lot smoother if Travis was here today?  Well, I mean, at least there's somebody to point the finger at.  Right?  I mean, that's what everybody needs to do is somebody needs to point the finger at somebody's  blame.  We do like finger pointing here.  We do.  That's for sure.  Yep.  All right.  You rock.  You rock comment?  Comment, you rock?  No comment.  No comment.  Wow.  Well, does Sal know what his duties are?  Duty.  Seems to be shirking his duties. 
[02:22:00]  I know my job.  I know what I should do.  And I guess that...  What are you supposed to be doing right now?  Right now, answering the phone.  Doing what?  With the phone.  What is the instruction on the phones?  The latest instruction is to provide phone calls that people who prefer to do fantasies.  Because right now, you're lollygagging.  So when Geoffrey Rush comes in, are you going to find people that hate his movies?  No.  And put them all up?  No, no.  Why would I do that?  That's silly.  But why are you building weekend programming?  It's Tuesday.  Exactly.  Yeah, we haven't even done enough radio to have a weekend program. 
[02:22:30]  The worst of the week countdown?  That's what you're building now?  Who told you to do that?  It's just something I've done since I was an intern here.  Sam, isn't it true?  I'll go back to Sam with this.  Okay.  If we haven't done radio yet, it's almost impossible to build weekend programming.  Yeah, well, I mean...  Isn't the weekend program based on the live show during that week?  The weekend programming of the Opie and Anthony show is highlighting the week of radio,  meaning even the promos themselves are reflective of the content that took place during the week. 
[02:23:00]  So you're building weekend programming based on that we did maybe two hours of radio at that point.  You were great, by the way.  I was building two great hours.  It's been a great show.  Sam's Honeymoon.  That'll be on the countdown, so at least he's getting that right.  No, no, no.  I was not doing that.  I was doing the Joe Rogan.  I was getting that.  Sorry, because we also got to build a promo for it.  Get that going.  Joe Rogan was getting stressed out while the live show was on.  But Joe Rogan, it is what it is.  He's just, you know, it's an hour of his podcast.  Right.  It's something I like to get a head start on so that it can be out of the way for later work 
[02:23:30]  that I need to do later in the week.  Theoretically, it could happen.  Instead of answering phone calls knowing that we have interns that are starting today.  Yeah.  Like, you could have done that at 10.05 when we're off the air or 9.59.  This is true.  This is true.  I just thought if there are interns in here answering phones, it's cool with the show.  It's cool that they're doing it.  Yeah, nobody's making the call.  Nobody's, like, clarifying, like, hey, it may not be a good idea that this guy, this intern  just started.  Let's put him on the...  There's nobody here to do that.  So, if you're up to Sal, it's just like, woo, who should be doing that, you think?  The boss. 
[02:24:00]  The executive producer.  Hold on.  I think we're all in agreement.  If Travis, you know, decides that the first week back from summer vacation is the week  he needs to take off, then the Radio Wizard needs to step in and fucking take care of  these issues.  But then who's the next in line?  Who takes over his position if he's not here?  We don't know because the Radio Wizard hasn't said that yet.  Yeah, there should be an interim, interim executive producer.  That's right.  And then they would make the decision to say, Sal, what the fuck are you doing?  Right.  Don't be building Joe Rogan promos. 
[02:24:30]  Get on the phones.  The guys need you.  Yeah.  Because the interns fucking just got name tags.  You shouldn't go from getting a name tag to jumping on the phones for this Radio Show.  And by the way, where's our Jeffrey Rush prep sheets?  Over here.  The printer is...  Okay.  Oh.  No, we got them.  That's good.  All right.  I want to see how butchered they are.  Sam, he starred in the movie Shin.  All right, good.  Sam, who do we blame today?  Who gets the big blame on this one?  It's tough because I would say...  I wouldn't say Eric needs to be blamed, but I think he does need to be held accountable for his words. 
[02:25:00]  He did say, before I left for Hawaii, he said, no, I've made it clear.  I am not going to be the intern boss when I get back.  So, literally, when the interns came up to him today and said, hey, Eric, I was wondering, what should I...  Eric should have been like, well, this isn't my job.  You know, that should have been taken care of.  That's what Eric needs to be held accountable for.  And we need...  Or not meaning what he says.  Well, yeah.  He made it up, I think. 
[02:25:30]  And...  Did you make it up, Iraq?  Why is he folding his arms?  Iraq?  Did you make it up?  Sam, say this.  No, I didn't make it up.  I think he probably did.  Iraq, Sam thinks you made that up.  What a surprise.  It was Thursday before...  Like, he was here on Friday.  I will guarantee that Iraq will be in charge of the interns this semester.  I will guarantee that.  And all semesters to come.  Oh, yeah.  And all semesters to follow.  Until management decides he's no longer capable of doing that job, he'll do the job. 
[02:26:00]  Why haven't they yet?  We also, I think, we need a direct...  Some blame?  Boss, I guess.  Radio Wizard?  Radio Wizard needs to appoint somebody to be the person, because the Radio Wizard gets  here at like...  Well, Radio Wizard decided that Travis should take the first week off, that we're back.  Radio Wizard.  But he doesn't get...  He gets here at like 8 o'clock, and he's got other stuff going on.  Like, there needs to be, I guess, somebody in charge of the show.  I'm just thinking if the executive producer for a really, you know, big radio show is out... 
[02:26:30]  Or this one.  Or this one is out.  But then the Radio Wizard probably should set his alarm clock a little earlier than 8 o'clock  to make sure things are running smoothly.  I mean, somebody's got to nominate a new boss.  I personally, if it were up to me, I think E-Rock should be an interim executive producer.  Oh, my God.  That's my personal thing.  E-Rock, would you accept that job title as well?  Based on what?  I mean, in terms of leadership skills...  Now he's just being mean. 
[02:27:00]  In terms of...  Are you saying he doesn't have leadership skills?  No, I'm saying the interim, interim executive producer needs to have leadership skills, a certain repertoire, a back and forth...  Je ne sais quoi.  A je ne sais quoi, a relationship with the talent.  Does E-Rock have leadership skills?  You don't think?  A certain panache.  No, he's shown that on all levels.  That he has no leadership skills.  The way he needs to also have a relationship with the talent that they can go back and forth, exchange ideas, not only on a personal level, but on a creative level. 
[02:27:30]  Do you think E-Rock likes to be liked too much to be a boss type thing?  I don't think E-Rock likes blasting out orders to people, because I think he likes being liked.  He'd be like, Sam, go do this.  And I'd be like, I thought we were going to do lunch later.  And he'd be like, all right, don't worry about it.  He'd be like, look, I don't want to tell you to do this, but, you know, they're getting on me.  And then that just breeds no respect.  Right, and I'd be like, yeah, I'm not going to do it.  Yeah, I'm not going to do it. 
[02:28:00]  And it's totally cool.  I'm not even going to get in trouble for it.  Right.  Yeah.  No, but I mean, no, I think, you know, a relationship with the talent, leadership skills, a certain amount of experience that he's acquired over the past several years.  And he just carries himself, I guess, somewhat regally, like old kings would, you know.  Oh, right.  How about we do this?  Like a sign of wealth.  Sam, how about we do this?  Iraq, are you willing to quit one of your job titles?  Head of the Interns.  Head of the Interns, yes.  All right.  Why don't you officially quit on the air? 
[02:28:30]  And then, Sam, I want you to go down the hall and tell the Radio Wizard.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's get it done right now.  All right.  Are you officially quitting?  As head of the Interns, yes.  All right.  And you want me to?  Yes.  I want to go down and.  Because right now, as we speak right now, interns can run amok.  There's no one seeing what they do or anything.  And make sure you address them as the Radio Wizard from now on.  They're like freshly freed slaves.  He does it.  Roland's going to make sure you call him the Radio Wizard. 
[02:29:00]  That's Gary's new name.  I don't know.  Let's listen to my dad.  14, why are you here?  Why am I out?  No, what are you plugging?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  My new CD came out today.  Oh.  Awful jokes from my first comedy notebook.  Nice.  I like the fucking cover art.  I heard a clip of it.  Did you hear it?  Yeah.  It was fucking.  And I remember those jokes.  Oh, wait.  You're doing something a little different?  Yeah.  Well, I found my first notebook that I was writing in.  Right.  When I was moving, I went through them.  I'm like, holy shit. 
[02:29:30]  This is brutal as stuff.  And I just did it on a podcast.  I read some of the jokes.  And then people went nuts.  Like, please put something.  I want to hear more.  I want to hear more.  So these are all just bad jokes that I basically came up with when I first started doing comedy.  Did you do this in front of an audience?  No, I did it in a studio.  Fuck it.  We're going to play a track for him in a second.  But Sam's now running.  So it's all just bad jokes that either made the stage or did.  And some of them actually did.  Because I remember I used to do a joke like, yeah, I got a sports car.  Yeah, you got to be a good sport to be seen in it.  I remember that one. 
[02:30:00]  I remember fucking one of my favorites is when fucking Florentine would do his impression of Stephen Wright.  And the fucking joke was, I broke my toe.  I had to call it tow truck.  Yeah, I broke my toe and I couldn't move it.  So I had to call it tow truck.  But he was so ashamed of it, as he should have been.  At the end, he would go, Stephen Wright.  Thank you, Stephen Wright.  Stephen Wright.  I blame that on Stephen Wright when the big bomb.  Yeah, that's good.  I locked a bunch of them in there.  If it killed, you would have mentioned Stephen Wright.  Yeah, of course. 
[02:30:30]  We were like, what is he doing?  Sam, did you address him as the radio wizard, first of all?  I didn't have to.  He's heard the title.  I don't think he likes it.  Why does he like it?  Well, I think he sees the inherent sarcasm.  I'd be flattered to be called a radio wizard.  The inherent sarcasm.  Yeah.  Thank God.  That will make my day.  Yeah.  All right, what do you say to him?  He said, what were your exact words?  I said they'd really like a comment.  Look, Gandalf, I don't think Iraq wants his job. 
[02:31:00]  I said they'd really like a comment on the quitting that Eric just did of his responsibility  of his intern boss.  And he said, yeah, he goes, I'm really not going to do this on the air.  Uh-oh.  But I know why.  That stinks.  But I get why.  He doesn't even get what radio's about.  But you know why he did that?  Why wouldn't you do it on the air?  I'll tell you why.  Why?  Because he'll come down off the air, and he'll be like, Eric, you can't quit.  Like, don't be a fucking dick.  And Eric will be like, okay, whatever you say.  And then he won't quit.  Oh.  Thus then, when I said, I guarantee he'll be in charge of the interns. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  And we'll get that answer tomorrow, by the way, officially.  But why would you go on the air with that after we just spend an hour on it?  Right now, intern anarchy right now.  Yep.  They are leaderless.  They don't have a boss right now?  They don't know what to do.  No.  They don't know what to do.  It's Lord of the Flies.  Right now, who's the intern boss?  Right now, there's just a void for power here.  Oh, man.  Oh, my God.  What happens if they run in here?  Are you going to come in?  You will?  Oh, man.  Why would you do that?  He will.  Exactly.  So you've got to go back to an old show. 
[02:32:00]  Every time an intern's in here, Iraq has been told he has to also be in the studio.  Yeah, yeah.  And he basically acknowledged that he would run in here if an intern ran in here.  And he wouldn't even, like, hypothetically, when I said, if an intern runs in, will you  follow him?  And he's not the intern boss, he said, but he did say he would.  That means you're still the boss.  That means you're the boss.  You're an intern cuckold.  Florentine, what track do you want to play off this? 
[02:32:30]  They're all bad.  It doesn't matter.  They're all bad.  Fucking awful bad jokes.  Awful one-liners.  Give me something.  I had to put awful in front of him.  What a great idea.  Because it's on iTunes, so I don't want people, like, discovering.  And being like, oh, this guy sucks.  Yeah, just go, I want to hear his comedy.  And go, what the fuck is this?  What is this crap?  Awful puns.  You know what?  Because when we first started, Jim, remember, like, all the headliner guys are doing puns?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  So I used to think I got to write a pun around everything I think of.  Yeah, go with the puns.  There was one that was really funny that you would do, though, about fucking misunderstanding 
[02:33:00]  a girl, because she was talking about cable, and you thought she was talking about her  period or something.  Like, she was talking about a-  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She goes, don't come over.  I got PMS.  I'm like, really?  You get that down in your area?  Like, you know, it was a cable channel.  Oh, yeah.  But there were some funny lines with that.  And there was one where-  And then I said, I didn't know the girl was on her period, so she's like, I don't think  you should come over to my apartment.  I thought she wanted me to come over because her apartment was dirty.  I go, why can't I come over?  Is it because your pad's a mess? 
[02:33:30]  And then, because she thought it was cable, and she was talking about her period.  She was like, what's the matter?  Are you having a problem with your box?  Yeah, yeah.  That's right.  That's a funny one.  All right.  Let's check it out from Florentine.  It's on iTunes today, MetalBlade.com.  Yeah.  Bad puns.  Awful jokes in my first comedy notebook.  And it has this thing.  It says over 220 awful jokes on the CD.  Yeah, I counted.  I counted the jokes.  It was 220 on here.  I will play this track right here for Jim Florentine. 
[02:34:00]  I went out with a girl with leprosy, but that relationship fell to pieces pretty quick.  I told her she was ugly, and she cried her eyes out.  Then I told her a funny joke, and she laughed her head off.  I was walking through the woods, and went up to a deer from behind and put my finger in  his back like I had a gun.  I said, give me all your dough.  Why would I think a deer would have money?  I broke my toe the other day, and I couldn't move it, so I called a tow truck. 
[02:34:30]  Ugh.  If I treated you to a Big Mac, would you be all over my Whopper?  I saw a sign on the road that said Scenic Area, next right.  So I pulled over, but didn't see Nick.  But I did talk to a guy named Gary.  I didn't make any friends when I was in high school, because my parents sent me to a private  school, so I just kept to myself.  I didn't have any friends because I was cracking jokes like this. 
[02:35:00]  I went for a job as a short-order cook, but they told me I was too tall.  I pulled my arm out of my socket, and next thing you know, my whole body shut down.  I want to pull my eyes out right now.  I cut my leg open, and I actually thought it was pretty funny, because it kept me in  stitches all week.  Why would I think that an open wound on my leg would be funny? 
[02:35:30]  The other day, I went out on a limb to save a tree.  I guess Cher left Sonny because he couldn't get a bono anymore.  My brother and I were looking at a map of the world, and he was eating a donut over  it, and pieces were falling all over the map.  I started thinking, what a crummy world.  Then I picked up a broom and started sweeping the nation. 
[02:36:00]  I'm always getting sick.  One day, one of my stereo speakers went out, and I caught mono.  I had a nightmare that I was washing my hands in the sink, and my ring slipped off and fell  down the drain.  I guess it was a pipe dream.  Do turtles get gas at a shell station?  I hit a deer, and it sucked because it cost me a lot of dough. 
[02:36:30]  I thought it was just going to be a few bucks.  You ever aim for potholes and accidentally hit a guy jogging?  I did one time, and he was all bent out of shape.  Why would anyone aim for potholes?  I went to motor vehicles the other day, and they asked me if I'd like to donate my organs.  I told them no, but I'm looking to get rid of a couple of pianos.  I'm a paranoid person. 
[02:37:00]  I was reading Spy Magazine the other day, and I kept looking over my shoulder.  Whenever I went on an interview for a job, they always wanted references.  So I'd bring an encyclopedia.  I saw this girl walking down the street, and only one of her nipples were popping through  her shirt.  I said, I just wanted to let you know that you have a headlight out.  I drove by a farm, and all these cows were resting up against a barn.  I said to myself, look at that lean beef. 
[02:37:30]  I never said that.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Have you ever wondered how many cubic feet of flatulence it would take to lift a hot air  balloon?  How many peanut M&Ms would it take to fill the average dog colon?  Well, wonder no more, friends.  Join me on my journey for knowledge, seeking out answers to the questions man has pondered 
[02:38:00]  since the dawn of time.  On today's episode, how much period blood would it take to fill a Chevy Trailblazer?  The average total menstrual cycle discharge measures 5 tablespoons.  That's 74 milliliters, or 2 1⁄2 clumpy shots of coppery goodness.  Bottoms up!  The usable interior volume of a Chevy Trailblazer measures 125 1⁄2 cubic feet, or approximately  939 gallons.  That means it would take 240,384 tablespoons to fill the Chevy Trailblazer to capacity with 
[02:38:30]  uterus.  That's enough period blood for 48,078 periods.  That's enough women to fill every seat of Safeco Field.  More like Mushrooms and Pennies Field.  LOL.  If one woman were to account for all that period blood, she would have to be perioding for over  4,000 years.  In the business, we call that YOP, or years of period.  What did you say?  You want a how much bonus round? 
[02:39:00]  Well, okay fans, how many tampons would it take to soak up all that bitching, crying, and  needless spending?  Well, let's see.  The average woman goes through an estimated 20 tampons per cycle.  Using our previously calculated figure of 48,078 periods to fill that Chevy Trailblazer,  we would need to go through 961,560 tampons to clean that mess up.  That's enough tampons to cross the Great Salt Lake at its widest point.  Now that's what I call one heavy flow. 
[02:39:30]  Get it?  Join us next time for an all-new edition of How Much.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Got Florentine in studio today.  Let's not forget about the new CD that's out today on iTunes and Metal Blade and where  else?  Anywhere else?  That's pretty much.  All right, good.  It's called Awful Jokes from My First Comedy Notebook. 
[02:40:00]  Over 220 awful jokes on this CD.  And we heard a track and wow.  Right?  Very uncomfortable.  There's a whole thing on there.  It's the last track.  I put it at the end is where I wrote this MTV audition script.  Because I was trying to be an MTV VJ.  So I wrote up this whole script of how it was supposed to go.  And oh.  Oh, pretty bad.  Oof.  Wow.  I'd love to hear that one.  I was trying to be like the cool guy.  My name was Jammin' Jim.  Because I was a DJ back then.  It's like, hey, Jammin'.  The girl.  I had like two girls around me. 
[02:40:30]  Hey, Jammin'.  Why don't you tell them how you're a comedian?  And then I start doing jokes.  Oh, whoa.  And this was serious?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, this was a thing I was going to.  And my friend was going to videotape it to play.  And we were going to send it to MTV to be a VJ.  So this is my script that I was sending.  This is a script I wrote.  I was trying to get a job as a VJ.  Oh, shit.  I don't care.  You can play it.  But it's probably very good.  I want to hear a little of it.  This is a script I wrote.  I was trying to get a job as a VJ at MTV. 
[02:41:00]  And I was going to film this.  And I used to call myself Jammin' Jim.  Oh.  And this script, I really thought I was going to impress the MTV execs.  And I was going to get it this gig.  It fucking stinks.  Here it goes.  Jim is standing with two hot girls.  He's talking to them.  And they're very attentive and giggling at his comments.  Jim.  I took this hot-looking chick out at the dinner the other night.  I really wanted to impress her.  I mean, money was no object on this date, is what I'm trying to say. 
[02:41:30]  So we're sitting in this Burger King, right?  Girls laugh.  My date starts to tell me that the last date she went on, the guy spent $400 on her and  didn't even try to kiss her at the end of the night.  What do you have to say to that?  I go, well, number one, the guy is a loser.  And number two, if I spend $400 on a girl in one night, I'm bringing a farm animal in  bed with us.  I'm getting my money's worth.  Can you pause this for a second?  I like it.  You know what?  So far, my favorite part of this horrendous endeavor is the fact that you wrote into 
[02:42:00]  an MTV script.  What was the opening line?  A fucking...  Jim's sitting around as the girls are giggling.  What was the first joke?  The Burger King?  Oh, you bet.  So I took this girl out to a nice restaurant.  Money was no object.  That's...  Money was no object.  Money was no object.  Who on MTV fucking talks like that?  Money is no object.  Money is no object.  Remember, kids?  Just use a little elbow grease.  Yeah.  That was a fucking show sponsored by Texaco in 1950. 
[02:42:30]  Sam should learn that lesson, though.  Money is no object sometimes.  Sometimes it is.  Yeah, well.  Girls are cracking up.  Cracking up.  Now, Jim all of a sudden notices the camera's on and the tape is rolling.  Jim.  Hey, cameraman.  Cue me next time, will ya?  I'm spending $500 on this demo tape and this is the service I get?  Service.  Both girls at the same time go, don't worry, Jim and Jim.  We'll service you later. 
[02:43:00]  Oh.  Jim.  Yeah.  I know that service is for free.  Jim winks at the camera.  Anyway, if you don't know me by now, my name is Jam and Jim.  Girl one.  Hey, Jam and Jim, tell MTV what you did at the radio station you worked at.  Pause.  Jim.  I sucked.  I love how they're referring to you as Jam and Jim.  Jam and Jim.  Nobody.  Hey, Anthony Cumia. 
[02:43:30]  Hey, Opie.  No one talks like that.  Hey, Jam and Jim.  I'm just getting pleasure out of it.  Even though I'm cringing, I'm just watching Jim's face.  Oh, yeah.  I'm just keying on him as this is playing.  Because I knew him when this happened.  I know.  This wasn't the 80s.  Why are you still friends then?  I didn't know this was going on, obviously.  Jim.  Oh, you girls like that story, huh?  I bet you do.  Well, a few years ago, I was the morning man at this radio station that played soft rock.  So one day, the manager comes in and tells me things aren't working out. 
[02:44:00]  Oh, boy.  And tomorrow's my last day.  Look out.  So the next morning, I got to the station before anyone was even there and nailed the front door shut so no one can get in.  Jam and Jim.  I went on the air and had a Black Sabbath festival for two hours.  After every couple of songs, I'd get on the air and tell them I was protesting, being fired, and I wouldn't get off the air until a local newspaper comes down and does a story on me.  Oh.  So I received my wish, and as soon as the interview was over and I took the nails out of the door, I got arrested. 
[02:44:30]  Oh.  Just another day in the life of Jam and Jim.  Come on.  Come on.  You weren't serious.  You are not serious.  You are not serious.  Another day in the life of Jam and Jim.  Just another day in the life of Jam and Jim.  Because that's what MTV wanted, you know.  A loose can, a wild man.  We'd do that.  With a little edge.  A little edge.  Not too much edge, but a little edge.  That was pretty crazy.  If you liked that story, there's plenty more. 
[02:45:00]  There's plenty more.  Can we clean up Jeffrey Rush's area a little bit?  Yeah.  He's coming in early.  We didn't even announce that we're having Jeffrey Rush in today.  He won some Academy Awards, right?  He's won the Oscar.  He won at least one.  For which performance?  He won for Shine.  He was amazing in 96.  Fuck yeah.  And I think he was nominated for the King's Speech, too.  He was phenomenal.  Yeah.  We had him scheduled for 930, but I guess we're going to get him early.  Which means we're going to, unfortunately, have to stop the Florentine CD thing right now.  People are waiting to hear what's going on. 
[02:45:30]  Wait.  There was more to that?  Oh, yeah.  Another three minutes.  There's another three minutes on it.  Oh, good.  I love that.  It's all Florentine's new CD, Awful Jokes, from my first comedy notebook.  Available on iTunes, Metal Blade.  There's also a section where I go, you know, hey, Jim, tell him how you're a comedian.  Then I tell these jokes.  Like, you know, I do examples.  I forget what the jokes are.  They're something about being a dog's a man's best friend.  How can he be a friend when...  I don't know what the joke is bad.  You must have just pictured the Jammin' Jim fucking logo up there, the, like, shit from MTV. 
[02:46:00]  But then I have a real serious moment.  I go, look.  I go, please give me this job.  I'm a comedian at night.  I can work during the day.  And I go, I'm a loser.  I still live at home.  I go, even when I walk by my cat, instead of my cat going meow, my cat goes, move out.  Oh, wow.  Even my pet frog took a leak on me. 
[02:46:30]  That's fucking terrible.  Oh, my God.  Move out.  The worst part is the fact that the girls are going, hey, Jammin', and not going, well,  shut up, you asshole.  Here he comes, Jeffrey Rush.  Holy fuck.  Nice.  Big star.  Hi, sir.  Good morning.  Have a seat.  How are you?  Jeffrey Rush, everyone.  Jeffrey Rush.  Take a seat.  Very nice to have you here.  Thank you.  Man, you're like a real star.  We get some, you know, in-between guys here.  And every once in a while, we get a real star. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Today's real star day.  Definitely consider a real star, that's for sure.  Seen you in quite a few movies.  And I'm embarrassed to admit we got your movie and did not, we were on vacation last week  and did not realize that it was your movie.  No, because we had one from Deepak Chopra, which was not good.  Wait, you checked out the Deepak Chopra?  I don't know where to begin.  I know.  Yeah, right?  You checked out that movie instead?  Yeah, because I didn't realize that that was Jeffrey's film. 
[02:47:30]  It's our first date back, so.  Yeah, we've been away.  Maybe Jeffrey would like my MTV audition script.  No, no, no.  Probably not.  So the name that you're promoting is called The Eye of the Storm, and it's in theater September 7th.  Could you just kind of give us a, just let us know what it's about.  The Eye of the Storm is about, well, in a nutshell, it's based on a very famous novel  by our Nobel Prize winning author from the early 70s, Patrick White.  But don't let that scare you.  Really, it's a massive, sprawling novel that's been made into this rather smart film by Fred Skepsey, 
[02:48:00]  who's one of our great senior cinematic maestros from Down Under.  Dysfunctional Family.  And interesting, the sort of buzz that I've heard from some Americans who've seen it,  they don't worry about its literary pedigree.  They just say, it's kind of reminded me of a crazy Wes Anderson flick.  Oh, really, yeah?  Who do you play in the film?  I play a failed actor. 
[02:48:30]  Oh, wow.  So you're playing me.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  I hopefully had to do a lot of research for that role.  It came unbearably easy.  Is it hard to play, because you're such a great actor, is it hard to play somebody who stinks?  Well, the film is set in 1972, which is exactly the year when I started out as a young actor.  So I was very much looking at Australian actors, all of whom at that stage used to migrate to England. 
[02:49:00]  That's long before people started doing the push across to L.A. or, you know, American films and stuff.  So there was a certain generation of a kind of actor.  You know, the names may be familiar now.  You know, people like Robert Heltman and Leo McCurn and Peter Finch.  You know what I mean?  Right.  That generation of actors.  But ultimately, it wasn't so much about, you know, making it a documentary about that period of history. 
[02:49:30]  It's more about coming back to see, to visit my dying mother, because my sister and I have fled home in our youth, because mum was a bit of a handful.  But we've sort of come back to try and make sure that our impoverishment is going to be helped by the bucket load of money that she's got.  Oh, okay.  So it's not a very noble cause that you're going back? 
[02:50:00]  No, no, no, no.  You're going back?  You had a shitty childhood and you're going back for her money?  Yeah.  Oh, fair enough.  That's the line on the poster that I think would sell it really well.  Fair enough, sir.  Fair enough.  Yeah.  Were you nominated for King's Speech?  Yes, I did.  I got an Oscar nomination for that.  When you're nominated and you don't win, they always show the guy being nominated being graceful.  But what is, because you've also won. 
[02:50:30]  So what is it that goes through your head when you hear the other name?  You sort of, I think you have a gut instinct about where it's going to go, you know what I mean?  Because there's such a kind of machine now, right from the, like at the moment, you know, the Telluride Festival's on, Toronto Film Festival is on, and then it goes through all the winter season, and then you've got the Golden Globes and the SAG Awards and the BAFTAs.  So you're kind of going to know. 
[02:51:00]  You have an intuition, and I felt pretty certain the momentum was behind Christian Bale on that one, you know.  Oh, for the fighter.  Rightfully so, because it's a, you know, it's a fantastic performance and a really great film.  Yeah, but do you still kind of ever look at something and go, like, yeah, I think I was a little better.  Well, I suppose, you know, you are aware that you're in that little box on the screen, and there's an impulse, I think, under everyone to go.  What?  Right.  You don't. 
[02:51:30]  When you won for Shine, which was amazing, I mean, that was an amazing performance.  Do you, was there anybody you forgot to thank?  Like, do you make a list of people that you have to talk about, and then there's somebody...  The Shine year was 97, and by memory, that was the first time they had America Online, and I had no idea what that meant.  There were a lot of people sitting outside the room at keyboards, and I thought, well, if you're interviewing me, where's it going?  People are going to read your typewriter.  You know what I mean. 
[02:52:00]  I had no concept of the web at that stage.  But they have, the academy's now set up a thing where, you know, they say, look, don't make your speech low and boring and mention everyone that you ever went to school with, because you can go online afterwards, and it's kind of a neater way.  Do it that way.  We're all trying to get the show down from three and a half hours, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, I mean, there's always got to be one person you forget, though.  Like, I always love the stories of guys who, like, forget their wives, where they forget, like, the one person that did the most for them. 
[02:52:30]  Look, yeah.  You know, you're up in front of however many thousands of people, and that, you know, mad fictional figure of a billion, I still don't quite work out where those billion people are on that particular moment.  You know, if you do the math, you go, well, with the time zone in Europe, they're probably all in bed.  I can't imagine too many people down in remote areas of South America up, you know, watching for the best picture nom, you know.  Are they fudging the numbers a little bit? 
[02:53:00]  Possibly, I don't know.  Did you get any crap from someone that you didn't mention after your speech?  No, generally, people were pretty good.  I mean, I, you know, I went out there and quite genuinely, I hope, and honestly said, you know, I want to thank every actor, every theatre worker I've ever worked with in Australia, because I spent 25 years doing that.  Yeah.  And really, Shine was the second film that I'd been involved in.  So, I wanted to give a nod to a lot of mates, but you have to kind of, you know, if you mentally prepare something in case you get that chance, you've got to make it, you know, it's like writing an ad, I think. 
[02:53:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You've got 60 seconds to maximize the impact, you know.  Did you really have some kind of a breakdown before that?  I mean, it talks about the, I guess, you never know what online, but it said in 92 that you were overworked, and you weren't happy with where your career was going.  And it was like, did you have something that happened which even might have prepared you for that role?  I think that's a comment from somebody else speculating that I wasn't happy about where my career was going.  Because it was going fine.  And I had a really good niche on the Australian stage. 
[02:54:00]  I got to work with all the major companies, and I had good connections with different directors and different teams of actors and stuff.  But, you know, when you clock 40 and you've been doing it for 20 years and you think, you start to think, if there's another 20 still in me, what will that be?  Will it get less interesting?  Will I get bored?  Will it get a little frustrating?  And, to be honest, working in the theater, around that time my first child was born, you start to think, I've got to start getting bigger, more regular bucks for most of the year, not just 25 weeks of it. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah, that's a lot of pressure, yeah.  Because you start to think somewhere down the track they were going to want to go to college, et cetera, et cetera.  So, yeah, I hit some kind of, you know, brick wall.  I think that's part and parcel, not only of our industry. 
[02:55:00]  I mean, I think everyone has a little reality check in their life at some point where they go, is it working out fine the way I'm doing it, or do I need to, you know, reshape a little bit?  So, to prove that you just don't know where the hell it's going to go anyway, because then, you know, the goddamn Pirates of the Caribbean money is pretty goddamn good.  It's a given in our job.  You know, if I can come up with the easiest analogy, we're like fruit pickers, you know.  And if they suddenly go, oh, there's been bad hailstorms, there's no fruit this year, then you go, oh, I'll have to do something else. 
[02:55:30]  Because, you know, I don't know now, I mean, I've certainly got more, maybe more regular opportunities and possibilities around the corner.  But I still don't know what I'll be doing after January next year, you know what I mean?  I've got a gig till then, and then I don't know.  Then you don't know, you're right, yeah.  I want to jump in.  What would you do for money if the acting didn't work out around 92, when you were sort of at that crossroads? 
[02:56:00]  When I was a student in Paris back in the 70s, I worked as a dishwasher in a French, really groovy little French restaurant.  And I really, really liked kitchen life.  But, you know, to do that now, you've pretty much, you've got to go on television.  Right.  To fulfill that dream, because that seems to be where everyone's cooking.  So I don't know if that would be as interesting.  Yeah, that would have been a big drop-off from a possible Oscar to the cafe in France, even if it was... 
[02:56:30]  Is it hard to pick up and leave your home country for a career?  Because...  Well, it had been hardwired in.  I was very lucky.  My stepdad was a shearer, sheep shearer.  So, and I got to know him in my mid-teens onwards.  And, you know, I knew from his career that he would work six months on and six months off.  It was very seasonally driven. 
[02:57:00]  So I had a very strong role model there, that it was possible to earn good bucks for six months and then the work wouldn't happen.  And, you know, it's like the cane cutters before they had machinery.  The cane cutters would work for six months of the year, then they'd go and have R&R wherever.  And when I started out as an actor, there were lots of, you know, Australia's a big country.  It's the same size as mainland USA.  So if you ended up doing a tour of Queensland, it would be like going through 15 or 20 states on the eastern seaboard. 
[02:57:30]  You know what I mean?  Yeah, yeah.  And that meant being away from home base for 10, 12, 14 weeks.  So those sort of experiences found their way in as part of the stuff you did.  Yeah, because there are some actors that, amazingly enough, keep it pretty localized for L.A., a lot of television acting and stuff.  You seem to do a lot of traveling in your acting.  It seems like not having that home base would be a little much to deal with.  We have a very strong home base in Melbourne, and my wife and family and myself sort of agreed on that very early on. 
[02:58:00]  Again, it's the logistics.  Australia is a fairly long way from everywhere.  From everywhere, yeah.  And there's not a lot of local work shooting in Antarctica at the moment.  I know.  So for us to go to Europe or to the States or somewhere in the northern hemisphere, it's, you know, I've just done it.  I flew in from Melbourne last night, so it's... 
[02:58:30]  Must be a nice first clap, right?  You just jump on the plane and haul yourself into another hemisphere.  Yeah.  At what point did you feel secure?  Like, I mean, you said you were 40 and you were having this kind of crossroads.  At what point did you feel like, okay, wow, this is really the way my rest of my life is going to go.  I'm going to be a really famous actor.  Well, I didn't know.  There was a, you know, I thought this could be a really fascinating one-off, and I enjoyed it on that level.  I met some amazing people in the States, you know, East and West Coast, who were promoting the film. 
[02:59:00]  And I thought this could be one of those actors that they might say, well, we put him in the too hard basket, you know,  because I didn't sort of fit particularly with that showcase role in Shine.  And it doesn't automatically lead to a lot of other genre option choices, you know.  Right.  There was a time when they wanted, they were offering me to play Liberace in a film because he happened to be a piano player.  And I thought, I don't know if I just want to specialize like that, you know. 
[02:59:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, a lot of great actors have made massive careers out of playing cowboys or playing cops, you know what I mean.  But piano players, I think you'd run out of stuff.  There's not a huge market for the piano playing actor.  Yeah.  I mean, there's the pianist.  Yeah, well, they've been done, the great ones, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  So now you are promoting this.  This is kind of like an independent film, right?  This is kind of, it's like a little bit of a less of a grand scale than you're used to. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, we, it's...  Which is kind of nice.  You know, the Australian industry is not, you know, studio driven on that level.  Um, there was a relatively good scale of budget, I think, uh, in, you know, relative terms.  A great team of people to have Judy Davis and a lot of the other actors in the film, uh, Fred had worked with over the years.  Because he's, you know, his first two films back in the mid-70s, he was very much at the forefront of the big film renaissance that we had with Peter Weir and Gillian Armstrong and so forth, you know, Bruce Beresford. 
[03:00:30]  Um, his first two films, Devil's Playground and then the very tough and powerful and controversial chant of Jimmy Blacksmith.  Uh, he'd always had a very strong connection with the Toronto Film Festival, so we were there with this film this time last year, Out of the Storm.  Um, and we were hoping somebody might pick it up for North American distribution, but that didn't happen. 
[03:01:00]  But now we've got this really great, fresh, funky young team called Sycamore who have jumped on the film and they're, you know, very keen to kind of get it into that.  I think they've got it booked into the Lincoln Plaza, which is great.  Sounds like exactly the right springboard for the new, out of the New York houses, you know.  Do you still audition for things or no?  Or do you, I went to an audition recently and I saw some like major actors walking out and I was surprised that they actually had to read. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  Well, one of them walked out and you could tell he wasn't thrilled.  Um, because he just had that, uh.  Maybe because he saw you.  Yeah.  That really does knock it down a scale.  You see me reading for the same part, you're like, ugh, this is a shit project.  I haven't, uh, no, it's been a while since I've properly gone into, uh, uh, you know, a multiple choice situation.  So like the King's Speech, they just say.  But normally you meet people, you know, you meet people and they say, look, I'd like to talk to you about this film and see what you think about it, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[03:02:00]  So for King's Speech, they kind of said, we'd like you to do this.  Are you interested in doing this?  Well, I was a bit aggressive on that one because I said, you need a guy who's from Australia in his late 50s.  Um, it's a, it's a short list.  Right.  It's me.  Were they looking at anybody else?  I was hoping.  I don't know.  I don't know.  But you heard about it and you wanted to do it.  No, I think in fact, uh, the actual play script of the, the stage play that, uh, has only just recently been produced in the, in the UK, I think. 
[03:02:30]  Um, it landed on my front doorstep.  So I was one of the first people to actually get to know that the story existed and the, the, the, the producers from England who wanted to put it on stage thought I might be interested because of the nature of the character.  And I read that play script and talked to my agents and said, you know, I actually think this would make a pretty fascinating film.  Um, so I kind of got, got in on the creative side as well. 
[03:03:00]  Yeah.  You kind of pushed it and then said, Hey, by the way, I'm available, which is kind of smart.  Yeah.  And I can do it.  You ever get, uh, with, with the pirates of the Caribbean movies, do you ever start thinking like, Oh boy, if I do three of these people are going to start thinking of me as that character.  And that's an obviously you'd seem like somebody that enjoys acting and I wouldn't want to be typecast in that.  Does that ever, uh, cross your mind when you're doing that?  Gore Verbinski, who directed the first three films, uh, he sent me this really fantastic cover note with the script.  I'd never met him, didn't really know who he was. 
[03:03:30]  Uh, and by memory, the cover note said something like,  you know, Jerry Bruckheimer's going out on a limb.  This pirate genre has always failed and has done since 1951 or something.  You know what I mean?  But he said, there's a great role here for the main villain of the piece.  And I'm, he said, I've always been attracted by actors.  And I'm quoting from bad memory.  He said, I like actors who can have something going on on the outside, but you know that something else completely different might be going on on the inside. 
[03:04:00]  And he referenced Alec Guinness.  Now, Alec Guinness is, I've never had the chance to meet him, but he's always been a kind of a hero.  Um, so that letter kind of got me interested, because he said, I don't want a summer blockbuster phone-in performance.  I want you to treat this with any, any of the sort of gravitas that you put into any other role.  Yeah.  And fortunately for me, each time they've come out with a new chapter, um, they've kind of played around with this character and taken him from being the badass guy into being the politician. 
[03:04:30]  And then, you know, then he goes and joins the king.  So for me, they've felt like quite, um, I feel like I'm in a very big Charles Dickens novel and you just don't know how it's going to end.  You know what I mean?  Were you happy seeing, uh, seeing the movie after, because I'm sure with all the effects and everything, it's very hard to kind of get a line on it while you're doing it.  Well, there was a great energy around the first film because we were buried in the summer release of 2003. 
[03:05:00]  Um, and there were, I think at that stage, high expectations for things like Incredible Hulk and maybe a sequel for some other film, whatever.  Um, and we, we opened very late in the season and it just went.  Oh, it took off.  Yeah.  It was insane.  Yeah.  You know, no one saw it coming.  There was no kind of, we thought that, you know, look, this is a fun film, but somehow I think Johnny's concept of Jack Sparrow and the whole spin of the, you know, the undead. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Before everyone started doing that in every film.  Yeah.  Even a film about Abraham Lincoln.  Yeah.  Involves the undead.  You know what I mean?  We're painting ourselves in a corner.  Yeah.  It must've been weird though.  At first when someone approaches you and goes, yeah, we're making a movie about a Disney ride.  Yeah.  Uh, you in?  You're like, ooh, well.  You know, there was a lot of negative press about that at the time, but I thought the Disney ride is actually fairly well researched. 
[03:06:00]  It was, you know, it was a golden period of about 50 or 60 years, mid 17th century, when all the colonial imperial powers were, you know, Spain and England and Portugal, whatever, were all ransacking places all over the planet.  Getting all their booty and taking it back.  And piracy emerged because there were a lot of ships with a lot of great wealth on them. 
[03:06:30]  And some ratbags said, hey, a really quick way to get some of this wealth is just kill a few people and take it.  You know what I mean?  I mean, so that's the 60 year window of history that was quite, quite intriguing.  Yeah.  That's why I, I definitely liked the way, uh, that was taken from, you know, cause people thought, oh, the ride.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yo-ho, yo-ho, pirate's life for me.  And then that's it.  And actually had a really good story.  But the run it is like, you know, if the ride hadn't existed, they probably would have invented it then based on the film.  Right, right.  Because when you go on that ride, you get every nuance about pirate folklore. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  Drunken taverns down in the bayou, whatever, you know.  Laughing around.  And I still can't work out, cause I'm not very good at engineering, I still can't work out how they get the water levels right.  You know, you start up on a Louisiana bayou with fireflies and then you go down 50 meters.  And there's more flat water.  Yeah, and you go, hang on, shouldn't all, shouldn't we be drowned? 
[03:07:30]  What a buzzer.  Did you, uh, did you, you, now they say according to the internet, were you Mel Gibson's roommate in 1979?  Yeah.  You were.  We, uh, when I first moved to Sydney, uh, I'd been a student in Europe and I came back to work with the Queensland Theatre Company again.  And then I thought, well, I'm going to go down to Sydney and try and get some jobs down there.  Um, and I landed on my feet and joined this very nice little sort of winter company where they had an ensemble of about 15, 20 actors doing two plays. 
[03:08:00]  Normally it would be a long, long forgotten European classic and some forgotten Australian piece, you know.  Um, and it was, uh, it was a great season and it had, you know, very notable Australian stage actors like Kerry Walker and Barry Otto who's ended up in films like Strictly Ballroom and so forth.  Um, and Mel was pretty much fresh out of NIDA at the time and had just made Road Warrior, I think. 
[03:08:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he was on the cusp of a, uh, very, the beginnings of a very big career.  And we did Waiting for God O together.  We were both in our 20s and we had a, we had a great time.  He was a, he's a really neat stage clown.  Um, yeah.  Yeah.  Was he quieter when you lived with him than we've heard him on the tapes?  He was channeling the energy in a very good way.  Yeah.  But is it weird to hear, because I get, I, so many of my friends do weird things, just, they're just not as famous as he is. 
[03:09:00]  Is it weird to hear somebody that you lived with at one point, like going through this and you're like, oh Jesus.  Like, I don't know.  I mean, it's such a, you know, it's a relatively long time.  Oh, you didn't stay close?  Uh, on and off over the years, yeah.  But I mean, I was pretty much based in, um, Australia till the late 90s.  Do you know what I mean?  Oh, and here, yeah.  I only got into an international thing.  In the 80s, yeah.  Yeah.  And stuff, yeah.  How much time does an Oscar buy you? 
[03:09:30]  What I mean is, like, because you're obviously a great actor and you've won other things, Tony, I mean.  But, um, like, Timothy Hutton won an Oscar for Ordinary People.  And he's worked, you know, he hasn't done amazing films, but he has worked very steadily since, I think, 1980.  And how much time do you think, when you win an Oscar, it, uh, it kind of just gets you offer, offer, offer?  Does that happen for five years or is there a ten-year window on that?  I don't know if there's any, any specific rule book on that, because it, it might depend a lot on the nature of the win, the role that you played, the kind of person you are. 
[03:10:00]  You know what I mean?  I mean, whether it opens up the possibilities that you can move into high-level franchise genre films and that's your forte and that's where you keep going and, you know, the people with the money go, yeah, get that person.  Um, or whether someone throws down a gauntlet, you know, look at someone like Marion Cotillard.  Now, she would be one of a handful of international actresses. 
[03:10:30]  I mean, I think there was Sophia Loren got an Oscar for an Italian film back in the early 60s.  That's kind of rare, but she seems to have found a very strong kind of inroad, not only into continuing with European films, but also making major studio or even independent American films.  Yeah, I guess it gets you in the door, but if you're, if you're a jackass, you're probably not going to stay with you.  Well, there are enough people, there's enough people out there now who have got enough time on their hands to analyze and write about these things. 
[03:11:00]  Yeah.  They're pretty quick to write about the people who may have nosedived or presumably didn't use their Oscar cred.  I, you know, that's why I said there's no rule book.  I guess it depends on what you do right after it, too.  Like, the couple of films after it probably make a big difference into how much is going to come in.  Yeah, well, I, you know, I did a, I felt very lucky because a wonderful Danish director, Billy August, cast me as Javert in a film of the Hugo novel of Les Miserables. 
[03:11:30]  Before Shine had been released, and I thought, this is just the kind of adventure that I need, because I don't know what's going to happen.  You know what I mean?  This could be, I could wave bye-bye to traveling on planes and continue my theatrical career in Australia.  And then, you know, I got, I got the two Elizabethan films, Elizabeth and Shakespeare in Love, back to back. 
[03:12:00]  And I thought, this, this is probably a way not to control your career by doing two Elizabethan films.  It wasn't, it wasn't really like the genre that was, you know, sparking the market.  But they both had nice roles in them and gave me a kind of, a bit of a spectrum of possibilities.  So, it was good.  When you do a movie like Shine, like, you, you played such a kind of a crazy character that, like, that to me is, I've watched that, it seems like such a hard thing to act. 
[03:12:30]  That, that speech pattern and the behavior and this, this kind of manic energy.  And it's like, are you one of those guys that becomes that person or can you be at craft services just eating a Danish and then go right into it when the cameras are set?  I've always said, you know, I mean, I, I'm an, I'm a, I admire enormously, you know, as a young actor, I watched slavishly the whole transition of, you know, from my high school years in the 60s when the studios were making musicals. 
[03:13:00]  You know, they all wanted to repeat the success financially of Sound of Music.  So, they started doing Star with Julie Andrews or Peter O'Toole in Man of La Mancha and then suddenly, you know, um.  Caligula.  Yeah.  Caligula, indeed.  And then, you know, all this alternative counter-cultural American cinema started.  So, all that early Jack Nicholson stuff, Drive, he said, Five Easy Pieces, Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman. 
[03:13:30]  And I used to watch those guys like a hawk because I thought it's amazing how do they put the jigsaw, the emotional jigsaw together of such intense, brilliant screen characterizations.  But, um, you know, I probably have been influenced more from, uh, uh, an English theatrical tradition that, that isn't so much as involved in that kind of, you know, Lee Strasberg history.  Right, yeah, yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Emotional recall, et cetera, et cetera.  Right, yeah, sink your entire being into it.  He's saying he doesn't buy any of that pretty American actor shit.  You know, I have worked with people who operate that way and I think it's, if it works for them, it's great because, you know, acting is such a kind of unpredictable craft.  It's, you know, it's the end product or the work in progress that gets put into the performance that is the end result.  But I've, I've often said, you know, for me, I, I like to take the character off at the end of the day and, you know, and then pick it up again the next day because it's, you're, you're, you're putting yourself into an imaginative state of play. 
[03:14:30]  That's how I see it.  Yeah, yeah.  And if, you know, if you're constantly in character, just to quote you, it's, you might end up doing your best work at the craft services.  Right, right.  You know what I mean?  Right.  That's my fear.  Yeah.  I'm shooting something on tomorrow.  Hopefully yourself.  I say that all the time, Jimmy.  It's, it's for a, it's for a local director we know named Joe DeRosa. 
[03:15:00]  He's a complete nobody, friend of ours.  But when you, when you rehearse lines, do you rehearse them?  Will you rehearse them in character or completely, or will you just kind of say them as yourself to make sure that you have the lines?  So that's a good in-depth question, actually, because I'm about to do a musical, a funny thing happened on the way to the Forum, which was a great vehicle for Zero Mostel, and Phil Silvers did it at one point, and Nathan Lane, all great people.  Big sandals to step into, you know. 
[03:15:30]  And it's a big verbal role.  He, he's a fast talker, you can imagine.  It was originally written and tailored around Phil Silvers, so it's got that Bilko kind of.  Oh, yeah.  A wisecracking, fast, manipulative rat bag, you know.  I, I find what I do now is, I liked it, that period of investigation, I like to keep it in the third person.  So I just go, I don't even read the script.  I get somebody to read it so I can hear it, the words in space, and not really know where they are on a page. 
[03:16:00]  Wow.  Because you can get a little blocked sometimes thinking, ah, I know the line is down the bottom of the page, but there's no way in the world I can remember what the verb is, and I know it's a very particular one.  It's an interesting one.  So I'd rather just hear it and go, ah, right, so my character says that, yeah, right, great, great, great, great, great, that's good, I got that embedded.  And then only really when you get up on stage or the rehearsal room floor or on set, whereby you know by the end of the day you're going to have to have found that in a performance context. 
[03:16:30]  You can only do it when you've got all the stimuli around you.  So they'll read you the script, wow.  So you'll learn the lines first so it doesn't take you out of the moment.  Like once you have them down, then you know you can get into your character.  Because if you're thinking about the lines, you're completely out of the character.  That's also age, and it depends on how text-driven the role might be.  You know, like in a film like The King's Speech, Colin and I would sit down and have 12 pages of duologue. 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That doesn't really happen in Pirates of the Caribbean, though having said that, it sometimes does.  You know, those guys, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, aren't shy of saying we're going to have a great scene where Jack Sparrow and Barbossa are both tied to a tree  and they don't know how the hell they're going to get out of this predicament.  And, you know, I unscrew my leg, I just happen to have rum inside the wooden leg, you know. 
[03:17:30]  And then we chat for three pages about how I lost the pearl.  So, you know, I like good dialogue.  I think it's always been there.  It comes and goes in and out of fashion in, you know, mainstream American movies.  But it's pretty fast and funny.  I watched The Three Stooges on the plane on the way over.  It just killed me because I'm a huge Larry David fan.  Larry David playing Mother Superior.  Now, he had chunky rants, you know what I mean? 
[03:18:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And those guys were doing very fast verbals with all that great slapstick hits.  See, I had been a huge Stooges fan from, you know, the old days, as they say.  But then I thought the movie had some really good laughs, too.  Yeah, I liked it more than I thought I would.  Oh, see, I said that.  And then people jumped on me like, blah.  I'm like, no, I thought it was.  It's tricky because the original Curly, particularly in the early 30s, was, I think, one of the great screen genius comedians. 
[03:18:30]  He was, like, fantastic out of this world, you know what I mean, in terms of a feral child, idiot, lovable, you know what I mean?  He lived in a whole world that you knew the entire rule book from.  But those three guys, I know nothing about the actors who played those roles, but I thought they cast it extremely well.  Yeah, they did a good job.  That's another thing.  It's so hard to look at anybody else in those characters, so it was kind of hard to see other people doing it. 
[03:19:00]  But I think they did a good job, definitely.  Well, it's sort of becoming now where Larry, Curly, and Moe have become characters, even though they were, you know, originally.  Played by those people, right?  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, I remember Steve Martin talking about this when he was remaking The Pink Panther.  He said, well, you know, The Pink Panther is now a kind of character who exists.  And, yes, there was the way Peter Sellers did him, but I'm going to do a different thing in the same way that Jude Law might do Hamlet. 
[03:19:30]  And then next time, somebody else might do Hamlet.  Or James Bond or other characters that have kind of, I guess, changed.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're telling us earlier that Jeffrey has to rap.  I guess he has other press.  He's a busy man.  But he's promoting The Eye of the Storm.  The Three Stooges and the Nobel Prize.  My shoot.  Your dumb shoot figure.  Yeah, my shoot with Joe DeRosa.  That's good that I asked Jeffrey Rush for a little advice to shoot with DeRosa.  Why couldn't I have a real thing tomorrow that I was get to talk to you?  Good advice is don't show up.  Exactly. 
[03:20:00]  Murder the director with a hammer.  Of course, the great Jeffrey Rush.  It's called The Eye of the Storm.  It's in theaters.  Well, today's the 4th, so it's in the 7th.  I believe it's Friday.  It is limited release, but that means, of course, New York and probably L.A.  and a few other major cities.  So, you know, you're one of the great actors.  I mean, you've won a tremendous amount of awards.  And you're truly amazing.  And it was a great honor to come to you.  Nice to meet you.  Absolutely.  Thanks, guys.  We're going to continue, by the way.  We're not going home.  We've got Matchbox 20 next.  Stay there.  We don't stay late for anyone, but some old pals are stopping by to say hi. 
[03:20:30]  Matchbox 20, Rob Thomas.  And I'm not sure who else from the band is coming in, but definitely Rob.  I don't know.  Rob Thomas.  We put the others in.  Who, uh, we go way, I mean, we go way back with these guys.  Do you remember when we flew down from Boston to do the Grammys at, uh, Roseland? 
[03:21:00]  At Roseland.  And all of a sudden, this band sits down in front of us.  And our first question was, who the fuck are you guys?  And they go, well, that's why we're here.  And it turned out, no one knew who they were yet, because they weren't on the radio yet.  They were brand spanking new.  But the record company believed in them so much, they already had them doing interviews  before the single came out.  They must have known.  They had to have known.  And that was Matchbox 20, and that was Rob Thomas.  And, uh, and then, uh, fast forward, they come up to Boston, and they filmed shit for 
[03:21:30]  our dumb Real Rock TV show back in the day, and then Rob Thomas goes on to be a massive  fucking star, and we, uh, continue to do our dumb show for, like, fucking 80 years.  And now our paths cross again today.  That's where we're at.  Yeah.  Jeffrey Rush, uh, was great.  It's amazing how good of an actor he is.  And, and just, his voice is really, I didn't realize how good his voice was.  He sounded more English than Australian, by the way.  I can't tell the difference between those two accents anymore. 
[03:22:00]  They seem very regal.  They seem very similar at times.  Yes, he was, like, very English.  I would love, I don't like one of these.  We got a guy that was bored to death by the interview.  You know what, this show might have passed you by.  Go fucking find something else to listen to.  Are you serious?  And you'll get people that are like, hey, you know, but I just, it's a lousy 30 minutes  out of your listening day.  Go find something else then.  What am I going to do?  That was a great interview.  It was, it was, I thought he was very nice and he loosened up as time went on.  It was cool.  He never does press either. 
[03:22:30]  You're very, very rarely.  You see him around.  Yeah.  You don't see him around that much doing any of that stuff.  So he's a fucking big, big star.  Well, then this movie is, we're waiting for, uh, I made a mistake.  Where's, uh, Matchbox 20 going to sit?  I got to leave in like five minutes.  So maybe they can take my chair.  So why don't you, you know what?  Why don't you leave all nice now?  We'll give you the big plug.  Are we only getting two guys anyway?  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Cause they're literally walking down the hall.  Okay, cool.  And I want to make sure we get the plug in for your new CD.  That's, uh, Jim Florentine was great today.  Holy fuck.  Awful jokes from my first comedy notebook. 
[03:23:00]  Over 220 awful jokes in this CD.  And when he says awful, he means it, by the way.  Yeah.  I hope, uh, you've made that point perfectly clear for everybody.  I just saw Fez in the hallway.  He said, I love that Jammin' Jim stuff.  Oh, really?  It's like, oh my God.  Oh, I am going to have to hear the rest of that.  I'll give you guys a copy.  Oh, I love it.  No, I'll actually buy it.  I'll get it on iTunes.  I'll pay for it.  Yeah.  I'll demand my money back for that fucking penis.  More of the hijinks of Jammin' Jim.  Trying to get that gig.  I have a joke.  I got kicked out of a voting booth cause they overheard me going eeny, meeny, miny, moe. 
[03:23:30]  You should have been kicked out of a comedy club for that too.  They wouldn't kick you out if they heard that though, Jim.  Jammin' Jim.  It makes perfect sense for this dumb election coming up anyway.  Girls laugh.  Yeah.  Girls giggle.  Girls giggle.  Now we got a guy saying.  And I'm in Marco Island this weekend.  Oh, beautiful.  All off to Hook Comedy Club.  Now we got a guy saying the interview was amazing.  See?  What are you going to do?  One guy hates it, one guy likes it.  What are you going to fucking do?  Matchbox 20 is entering the, well, I thought they were. 
[03:24:00]  Yes, I know.  Oh, it's two old guys instead.  Never mind.  Yeah, what the hell is that?  Never mind.  Thank you, Florentine.  Yeah.  It was great seeing you guys.  Always fun, man.  September 13 through 15, I'll be at the Irvine Comedy Club in Irvine, California.  I return.  Irvine.  I'll have to plug that.  I want to stay cause I want Matchbox.  We'll see if Matchbox 20 walks into Jim's gas.  Oh, right.  Yeah, one's hovering right here.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, no.  You can hang.  I just didn't want you to have to leave awkwardly as we're interviewing those guys.  It's up to you, man. 
[03:24:30]  You know that.  Done it before.  That smells.  Come on, man.  Matchbox 20's got a new album out that comes out today.  It's called North.  Where are these guys?  Yeah, down the hall.  How's your eye?  What the fuck happened, man?  All right.  Well, you know I had that Rotgut reunion gig on Friday.  Which we've got to talk about tomorrow.  It went really well.  It was a lot of fun.  Fucking crowd was great.  The band, I mean, tight as fuck.  Those guys.  It was really, really cool. 
[03:25:00]  So, if you notice, I've had this mullet growing out and underneath the hat is a curly fro.  Because I wanted to kind of brush it out, spray the shit out of it, and go on stage with as much of a fro as I could grow in the limited time I knew we were going to be doing this gig.  Right.  Because I didn't want to wear the baseball cap and I didn't want to just have regular haircut, Anthony.  I needed kind of a rot-gutty feel to it like the old days.  So, that's what I did.  And then I decided I needed some medicine, as Bob Kelly calls it. 
[03:25:30]  Some medicine.  A little coloring for the hair?  Yeah.  You know why?  Because you get some gray in there.  I figured for the rot-gut thing, the afro, I'd put some just-for-men in my hair, darken it up a little bit.  So, I did it.  And everything was fine.  Worked great.  Saturday morning, I wake up and I notice my head is burning and tingling and itchy and unbearable.  And then, the side of my face, by my right ear, underneath and in front of my right ear, to my jaw, starts puffing up like fucking half a Hulk face. 
[03:26:00]  And the left side's doing the same thing.  And my ear, the top of my ear is like a chemical burn on it.  And my scalp is fucking screaming red.  Is this still live read for Just for Men?  Yeah, yeah.  Tell fucking Wilt Chamberlain and fucking...  Walt Frazier.  Oh, it's Walt Frazier?  Yeah, Wilt Chamberlain's dead, so...  Oh, okay.  Walt Frazier's one of those guys.  Tell Walt Frazier and fucking, uh, what's his name? 
[03:26:30]  Seinfeld.  Yeah, it's baseball.  Come on.  86 Mets.  Keith Hernandez.  Yeah, Keith Hernandez.  I forgot his name, too.  I know.  I'm like Keith Hernandez.  Holy fuck, yeah, of course.  Yeah, they could take their boiling acid fucking bath hair color and go fuck this.  The mother's with it.  You really think it's Just for Men?  Absolutely.  I went online and it's all over there.  All over there.  People are getting reactions to the chemicals?  Getting fucking burns and just, like, swelling up. 
[03:27:00]  It was so swollen.  I was taking, like, Cordaid cream and smacking it all over my head.  And it just, it still hurts.  Like, the headphones are fucking killing me today to even wear them.  Around my ears and the back of my neck and everything.  You know what would help with that?  What?  There is actually something.  When the Just for Men is bothering you, you wash it with a 50 cal.  Shut up.  Hey, Rob.  There he is.  What's up, buddy?  How you doing, man?  How you guys doing?  Holy shit. 
[03:27:30]  Long time, man.  How you been?  We've been good, Rob.  Not too shabby.  I know how you've been.  I was just telling the story the first time we met when we flew down from Boston to do  the Grammys at Roseland.  And you guys sat in front of us.  And our first question to you, and I'll never forget it, was, who the fuck are you guys?  And you laughed and said, that's why we're here.  You guys were already doing interviews before the single came out.  That's how much the record company at the time believed in Matchbox 20.  Yeah.  Or they didn't. 
[03:28:00]  And so they just fucking put us out there to make sure that, yeah.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Try and return their investment.  And I laugh at that because I said, who the fuck are you?  And obviously you showed the world who the fuck you are.  No, I still get that sometimes.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I'm using how it's like Target.  Do you know who the fuck I think I am?  Come on.  That was 90...  That was a long-ass time.  95, 96.  Yeah, they record came out 96.  Wow, man.  That was funny, too, because during that time we put out a single, this song called Long  Day, and Atlanta kind of really got behind it, and it just fucking tanked. 
[03:28:30]  I mean, it didn't do anything at all, and we were kind of nervous, and the day our record  came out, our label folded, like lava kind of folded in Atlanta.  Oh, that's great.  And all these other acts get dropped, and we're just waiting for the phone call, you  know?  Yeah.  And then one station in Birmingham started playing Push, and it kind of called out, because  that was back at a time when you could do that, too.  It was funny, too, like, how things have changed, like, the program director liked the song  and just started playing it.  Yeah, they just started playing it.  That doesn't happen at all.  It was funny, too, like, we were, like, planning our musical funeral at that point, too. 
[03:29:00]  It was just like, man, dude, it's been really good playing with you, brother.  I enjoyed it, dude.  Really nice.  Wow.  What are we going to do with the van?  What are we going to do with the van?  How many years were you at it at that point?  As Matchbox 20?  Well, as Matchbox, not very long, because we were at Tab of the Secret for, like, four years  maybe in, like, his local band, and that band broke up, and then we met  Kylan and Adam brought in and started this band.  Yeah, it was a producer of Matchletic, kind of, I met in Atlanta, and he introduced me  to these guys, and so that's why I kind of felt that way, you know, because I had moved  down to Orlando, and then at that moment it felt like, well, there was the single, and 
[03:29:30]  you know what I mean?  Yeah.  I guess we're going to be moving on.  We're a cautionary tale, Adam.  But, yeah, but Birmingham really set the whole thing off, you know?  By the way, Kyle Cook, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah, sorry.  Yeah, exactly.  I had to urinate America.  Oh, yeah?  Nice.  We didn't meet you that day.  I know that you guys kind of go for anything here, but I figure you should piss outside.  How long does it take before you know a single, like when you release a single and you said  it starts...  Hey, I didn't even notice you're here, man.  I fucking love you.  Oh, thanks, man.  How are you, man?  Thanks, I'm good.  How are you doing?  I hate that. 
[03:30:00]  Thanks.  Rob, we don't like when people do that.  When they know Jimmy.  We don't like that.  We don't like when people know Jimmy.  When famous people know Jimmy, it's like, oh, boy.  Well, just a couple of men of similar ilk.  What ilk is that?  And look how happy it makes Jimmy.  Oh, he's so happy right now.  No, you know, it's just...  How long does it take before you guys know that a song is...  Rob just touched the mic.  How long do you know, like if a song is not going to do well, how long does it take before  it sinks in?  Like, oh, fuck, this one is really not going to... 
[03:30:30]  Like, you said that one tanked.  How long does it take you to recognize that?  Well, that one, since it's your first single, you notice it kind of right away.  Oh, okay.  Shit.  Like, if you're lucky, like you're coming on this, like if you put out a single and  it starts to really do bad, before you mention it to anybody, you just try and throw another  one out there, you know?  It just seems like when people start talking about shooting the second video, then it's  usually like, you know...  Oh, man.  So we're planning...  Did we just do the first one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No problem.  No, it's a good thing.  You can have two songs out there.  That we just want to have in the chamber, you know what I mean? 
[03:31:00]  Yeah, yeah.  It's doing so well, we just want to...  We just want you guys to put out a song that people are going to like.  So let's try this one.  Did you ever, when you're writing a song, and even when you're recording it, do you  ever think like, oh, man, this is a hit, this is going to be huge, this is the one that  sounds like it, and then it just goes nowhere?  Yeah, sure.  Actually, Long Day was one of those.  I mean, I felt that that was going to be the giant hit on that record.  Yeah.  You know, it's all a matter of taste at the end of the day, you know what I mean?  Each one of us may respond to a song differently, so I think it's a combination of what you really 
[03:31:30]  love, personally, and what, you know, the people at your label, you know what I mean,  feel is the best representation of that album you made, like this mosaic of, you know, emotions.  Yeah, you're a catchy hook, though, when you're writing a song, you're like, oh, that's a  good one.  I think, like, the job is kind of like, you write a whole bunch, like, 12 songs that  you think should be on the radio, like Logic Be Damned, you know what I mean?  Like, you know that, like, you know, like, really in the back of your mind that it won't,  like, this doesn't fit this format, or you kind of understand how radio works, but at 
[03:32:00]  the end of the day, like, you're like, I think all of these songs should be somewhere, you  know, out there in the world for people to hear.  You shouldn't have a song on there that you're like, ah, we got to fill up.  Yeah, because what the fuck are you doing?  Like, you see, I think, you know, if you're like, you know what, everybody, don't listen  to these two.  These two, they're just filler.  But the other ten are great.  These are like the sound of me jerking off, but these are really, really good.  But you know what?  You got to be careful with the catchy thing, you know what I mean?  Like, just because something catchy doesn't mean it's going to be something you want  to hear in 10 years, 20 years, you know, a lot of times, like, it's like, it can be  like sugar, you know? 
[03:32:30]  It's like, it satisfies you in the moment, but it's not like nutritious.  Yeah, so like Carly Rae Jepsen would be Bruce Springsteen right now.  Yeah.  It's like, yeah.  But you guys have been at it, what, 15, 16 years now, huh?  Yeah, this, this, 96, since the record came out, it's been about 16, 17, yeah.  Damn.  How much has regular radio changed since you guys started, too?  Because we have such a hatred of it just from this angle, but.  I mean, it's been crazy.  I mean, like, when we came out, we were, I mean, there was, like, alternative rock kind  of radio, and that was the band that we were, and then even within that first record, when 
[03:33:00]  we put out Push, then we were a top 40 band, but even top 40 was, like, you'd hear Pearl  Jam sometimes, like, it was during that time in the 90s, and then by the time our next record  came out.  Yeah, like, we did Mad Season, it's all like, you know, Nelly and Ludacris and all this,  and we're trying to, like, go into that world.  So, and now it's like, you know, it feels like this, you know, if you're on top 40,  it's like these eight songs written by Dr. Luke, you know, and if you're on AC, well,  then just nobody cares.  So, it's, you know, between those two.  Yeah, and then trust your radio trying to figure out what demo is listening to, you know what 
[03:33:30]  I mean?  Like, how they do their call-out research is beyond me.  I mean, you can't, how can you know what people are really listening to on their cars?  They don't know what they're doing.  Yeah, it's even changed now.  Now it's like, it's all conjecture at the end of the day.  When I first got into radio, one of my jobs, you know, I had to do a lot of grunt work.  I would call, cold call people and say, all right, I'm going to play some samples for you.  Guess what I did?  I fucking fudged the numbers.  I don't want to sit around waiting to get someone on the phone.  You just got to make a decision, right?  Yeah, because everyone's screaming at you, do you know I'm eating this? 
[03:34:00]  You know, they're yelling at you.  I'm like, fuck this.  They've even changed it a little bit now where it's like, it's almost like a Nielsen box for TV  where they have like these random listeners in a beeper.  The people, you know, and they're always like, they have to like comment on what they like.  People meters destroy personality radio because they realize people aren't listening long enough  to have a guy that could talk about some interesting shit.  Yeah, but you know, it also creates this weird climate where the only thing that's rewarded  is something that sounds eerily similar to the thing before it that was successful.  So like the idea of being able to have a breakout anything is kind of really weird. 
[03:34:30]  So I'm surprised when like on Top 40, an artist like Jason Mirage has a song like, you know,  when he did with I'm Yours, that giant hit that he had, just him with an acoustic guitar and like an ukulele.  You're just kind of blown away when something like that flies.  Yeah, you know.  Yeah, it's very rare these days.  What was Elvis' first big song?  Like it's an old story, but he got so many calls for it.  The guy just played it over and over and over again.  Like Heartbreak Hotel or something like that?  I don't remember.  I think it was Hound Dog.  It might have been.  I was going to go on Hound Dog too.  Whatever it was.  It was just, he replayed it like 17 times in a row. 
[03:35:00]  And it was like one of those things where you would never see it.  It's not that you'd need that now.  No one's alive doing that shit on regular radio.  You can't even play it twice in a row now.  We did a station, it was here in New York.  And this was a few years back.  But you're sitting in there with the DJ and she's taking calls, you know.  And they're doing it for like the most requested of the day or whatever.  So she picks up the phone and she's like, hey, you know, this is blah, blah, blah.  Okay, you're, and before the guy could say anything, she's like, okay, you're going to request J-Lo.  My love don't cost a thing.  And he's like, okay, she gets recorded.  He's like, I want to hear J-Lo, my love don't cost a thing. 
[03:35:30]  And she's like, the most requested song of the day today is J-Lo.  I mean, if you ask me, if you ask me, the only real litmus test is tickets.  You know what I mean?  Because like you can, we can sit here and make guesses on what, you know, how the song's doing in a region.  But if that artist goes there and, you know, you, you, you have this hit song and they're spinning it,  but only like, you know, a hundred tickets are sold.  Well, then that, if you've asked me, that's a litmus test.  You know what I mean?  Because obviously they don't have the value.  But that's harder and harder these days to be because like, it's harder for an artist now, 
[03:36:00]  if you're a brand new artist, to get yourself to the status where you have a touring base anymore.  You know what I mean?  Like, well, and you, yeah.  And you see a lot of these pop artists that have big hit songs, quote unquote, and, and aren't doing tickets, you know?  So was the quote on hits or songs?  And you guys finding it hard to make money off the actual music or, you know, you got to make more of your money touring, right?  Yeah.  Touring, merchandise, publishing.  Like, I think that's where most of the money, I mean, that's always where it mostly came from.  Unless you sold eight to 10 million records. 
[03:36:30]  Right.  You know, most of that money is funneling back into your label.  It's still huge.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you know that Smooth was going to be such a fucking monster song?  No, God, no.  I mean.  Holy fuck.  Did that call out, Will?  I thought.  No, it didn't actually.  It didn't.  Did you know at the time, Carlos throws this thing together where he's going to get a bunch of guys singing?  No, you know, I figured it was one of those things where like, I'm a huge Carlos fan.  And I thought like, I would do it and just have to call my friends and be like, oh, by the way, there's this new record coming out.  You should be, you know, I'm all right with Carlos.  Right, right.  And that's what mostly everybody that I talked to that was on that record, like Dave Matthews and, you know, even Eric Clapton, 
[03:37:00]  and they all did it just because they love Carlos.  You didn't expect anything from him.  Yeah, of course not.  And then it became, you know, that song was like the first float in the parade, but that whole parade, that was his year.  Oh, yeah, it was really great.  You had the breakout song above everyone else.  Yeah, I really lucked out.  I mean, but then it had Maria Maria and Love of My Life.  Like, there was just a lot of good stuff on that record.  No, I agree.  That was the song of that frigging year.  It's still a monster song.  I was living in Soho at the time, and I remember like walking down the street and seeing a car full of really hot girls 
[03:37:30]  passing by, you know, blaring that song, and I'm just like, oh, we're on to something now.  I'll tell you something I've never seen a hot full of girls listening to my nonsense.  I live for the day.  You listen to my voice.  I've never seen a chick under 350 laughing at my stuff.  Once you've seen your act.  And it's frightened.  It's just one of those songs, too, you don't get sick of listening to it.  You just don't.  Really?  No, you just don't.  I'm sure you've heard a few more times than most, but. 
[03:38:00]  I don't get sick of playing it, but I get sick of listening to it.  Do you really?  It happens a lot, yeah.  Wow.  I think with a lot of songs, like after a while, you don't ever want to hear it again,  but when you play it in front of people, it's fun again, you know, because you're kind of sharing that energy with them.  So the same with Matchbox songs, like over the last 17 years.  By the time you get done recording an album, aren't you kind of spent on the songs?  Because you've been through them a few times now?  No, I don't think so.  I mean, because you're doing like all 12 or 20 songs at one time you're kind of throwing in there.  So up until the minute that it's done, like they're kind of evolving. 
[03:38:30]  And you're still kind of, like I still listen to this record because it just comes out today.  Yeah.  So like I'm still, you know, kind of listening to this record.  That'll end in like a month.  You know, I've already picked out all the nuances, heard it on like car speakers and home speakers and my friend speakers and heard it really, really drunk and really, really high.  And like every possible way you can listen to a record.  The mix is like, you know, it's like the editing of a movie.  You know what I mean?  Like you've got all these scenes and you've been, like you said, living inside each one of these scenes for so long.  But yet, you know, the mixes are evolving.  So like you haven't really watched it yet. 
[03:39:00]  And so it does feel new.  And I think we kind of, we did a van ride from like Tampa to Orlando or something.  We finally listened to the record together.  And high to bejesus.  It felt new, you know?  You know, you're high as a kite, like listening to it for the first time all the way through.  That's cool.  And it was just like, oh.  I see this record.  There's a little background right there.  Oh, I love that.  I love that.  Yeah, right.  I listen to this.  Do you ever listen back to a lead vocal and hear something and go like, fuck, how'd that get through? 
[03:39:30]  Dude, all the time.  Especially me, man.  I mean, like I, when I first started out, my voice was totally different.  I was living in the South.  So I had this really thick accent.  So like when I listen back, it's like, you know.  I want to hear.  I want to hear.  I want to hear.  So I would treat Elvis and Darius Rucker.  Like I would hear that.  And like everybody would like come to me and be like, oh, I know.  And all of a sudden, like I'm Scott Stapp every time.  They're like, oh, I know.  There's three out here.  I'm almost been home.  You know, like Scott Stapp, Elvis kind of impersonation that they would do.  And every caricature somebody would draw of you had like your veins were just like blowing 
[03:40:00]  out of you.  Like your eyes are huge.  Your neck's like blown out.  And then we look back and we look back.  Like, you know, you put you, you do a tour and you put out these tour books.  It's basically just like a bunch of pictures of the band.  And we look like a gay softball team.  Like we were, it was like a lot of sheer velvet and stuff.  And I'm like, and I had this epiphany while we were making this record.  I'm looking at this like 17 year old, 15 year old tour book.  And I'm like, you know, anybody that didn't like us in the 90s, I fucking get it now.  I totally get it.  I totally excuse anything anybody's ever said or written about me.  Because if I came across that band in that, you know, leather pants and the sheer velvet 
[03:40:30]  shirt, I would have just want to smack them too.  And let me tell you, you guys survived.  A lot of the 90s bands didn't survive.  We talk about that.  That's, that's the discussion that seems to pop up a lot, you know, because you can't,  you try to understand why that is, you know, right.  And you can sit there and you can dissect the music and, and, and, but yeah, it is socially  like in that social climate.  Like, why, why are we still like to think it's just cause we're fucking awesome.  It's the awesome.  We're obviously doing something right.  You know what I mean?  Like, and there's, there's a, there's a chemistry there that works. 
[03:41:00]  We keep our mouth shut and our head down and just make records and don't bother anybody.  Well, I think it's also, if you look at bands that have made it and stayed through for many  years, it's the type of music that just, it transcends a genre or just, just some kind  of a fad.  You know, it just sounds like, like it fits in any of these decades.  That's a huge compliment.  Definitely, man.  You hope that it's just songs.  I mean, that's the whole idea.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like it's not good songwriting style band.  Like we're not here to like, you know, preach to like some small disenfranchised group 
[03:41:30]  of, you know, upset teens smoking by the wall across from school, you know, like we're  just there for, for songs, for people in general.  Yeah.  Right.  Nice.  Is it hard to look back at your videos?  Like, cause I, I look back on stuff I did and I literally want to cut my own throat.  It's humiliating.  And I imagine some more than others, but yeah, music videos probably are harder to look  back on than actually hearing something.  Aren't they?  Well, it's silly.  It's funny.  You see, like, like if you watch old, you know, if you watch like at the very beginning,  the dawn of like music videos, you see like a Rod Stewart video or something.  Oh yeah.  That wasn't our era.  Like, I'm sure Rod Stewart looks back at, do you think I'm sexy? 
[03:42:00]  He's like, oh dude, wow.  You know what I mean?  With the lighting and whatever.  So I think like technology was pretty good by the time we started doing videos.  So I think at least the quality was good.  It holds up a little longer.  The video is good.  But we still look gay like he's cringe.  It wasn't that we did look gay.  I wish there was an 80s.  Like, remember like the old Greg Kin videos?  Sure.  Like the Jeopardy?  Like, and we're, we're here now and we're having a devil bride and now there's a giant octopus  coming out and attacking everybody and like.  It just didn't make sense.  Genius.  There was no sense to it.  I love that.  Which was kind of, and you'd sit, and I remember watching MTV for just hours on end. 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  Hours on end.  Yeah.  Waiting for, you know, oh, this one's coming up.  Especially if there were new videos coming.  Yeah.  Like, what are they going to do, man?  Is it going to be another giant octopus?  Yeah.  What are they going to do?  I hated new videos.  I only wanted to see, they had three live Aussie videos and fucking like Martha Quinn never  played them.  I despised it.  You had to, you had to stay up like until like, uh, like midnight on Sunday to watch like 120  minutes to like get, to get some, yeah, nobody was checking out.  Get some good stuff.  Yeah.  Or Headbangers Ball.  And like, well, I remember when you would, you would, you know, you would wait for the, 
[03:43:00]  you know, that you would wait for them to spend a thriller, you know, and like, that was  a huge moment, you know, because he really made it interesting, you know, that was a time  when I was kind of coming up, you know, that was like a movie.  They would, yeah, but they would tease it.  They would go like, coming up in the next three days, we're going to get to the thriller.  We didn't want to fuck Ola Rae.  Come on, just play it already.  The chick from that video, Ola Rae, what a fucking dumper she had.  She was lovely.  We had Nina Blackwood in here.  We were kind of starstruck.  Oh, yeah, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, man.  One of the original VJs.  Those 80s VJs that like, as soon as you see me, it's like, holy shit. 
[03:43:30]  I preferred her in Vice Squad.  You ever see that movie where she played a hooker who got murdered by Wingshauser?  No, I didn't know the movie, but I didn't realize that.  Yeah, that was neat.  No, she talked about that.  She said it was actually before she got the MTV gig.  She gets beaten with a hanger to death.  Jesus.  Do you guys remember Matt Penfield?  Of course.  Yeah, sure, I know Matt.  He's still DJing here in the city, but he was like that guy that knew everything about  everything.  You know, he's like, this record came out on July 1976.  The bass player had bunions when he did it.  He had to record everything on one foot. 
[03:44:00]  His mother's name was Martha, and it was pretty crazy.  And you would just listen to that for whatever reason.  What about the new record?  What could you tell us?  We haven't even sold any albums yet for you.  It's called North.  I know that.  And it comes out today.  Right.  Yeah.  I guess that's it.  It's fucking awesome.  12 new songs.  I think the thing about this record is there's a natural progression that I think we all felt  needed to happen.  In the beginning, Rob brought a lot of songs in, and he was by far the best songwriter 
[03:44:30]  in the band.  I think there was a lot of talent that didn't sort of arrive until second or third record  as far as songwriting together.  You know, we started looking at a lot of the groups that we love and really, you know, inspire  us.  And that's U2.  You know, this is, you know, you look at the Beatles.  You look at, you look at so, there's so much that makes the record interesting that doesn't,  you know, it doesn't get samey because people are sort of, you know what I mean? 
[03:45:00]  Like, one guy kind of carries the torch for so long, and then when that idea dies, and  someone else kind of grabs it and runs with it.  So I think this record is where we are now as songwriters.  Yeah, there's a lot of collaboration.  Like, we kind of wrote a lot of stuff together, which we didn't do in the past, but everything  came out great.  It's your first album in a while, compilation album, right?  Yeah, the first full one in like 10 years.  I mean, a full, I should say full, right?  Yeah, because we did, like 10 years ago, I guess we put out the last full record, and then  I did a solo record, and then we did the Greatest Hits record that had like six new 
[03:45:30]  songs, and then another solo record, and each one of those records, there's a lot of, like  we're a band, and I'm a, you know, when I do solo, it's all about touring.  So you put out a record, and you're out for at least a year, year and a half, just traveling  around the world.  So there's just a lot of time that passes in between that, and then the time it takes  to make a record, you know, you give yourself a couple months to get your head back on,  and you know, so my wife doesn't leave me kind of time.  Wait, as a lead singer, I'm always confused by this.  Yes, Opie, yes.  You're in a popular, you're obviously in a very popular, successful band, and then you go off on  your own.  How is that different? 
[03:46:00]  In your head, as a lead singer, because you're like the voice of the band.  Even when I was writing everything for the band, A, it wasn't my decision on every song  that got through.  You'd have to bring them in, and it has to go to the taste of everybody.  And then even then, if they like a song, you give it up to the band, and they do whatever  they want with it, the arrangement, you know, all the parts, everything.  Whereas solo, you kind of go in, and it's your chance to see if you were responsible for  kind of everything, do you think you could pull that off?  And so if you listen to a lot of my solo stuff, it gets a little more poppy, it goes in some 
[03:46:30]  more direction.  The first single was a song called Lonely No More, and if I would have brought that to  the band, I think they would have been like, you know, I'd love it, maybe for you and Carlos,  but I just don't think that fits what we're doing.  And during this record, there were times where there was two or three songs that I'd bring  in, and everybody's like, you know, I love that song.  And now, because I've made solo records, it's like, well, that sounds like your solo record.  It doesn't sound like something that fits on this record.  I think what I'm getting at, like, when the Stones did their solo thing, all of a sudden  Keith is singing.  You know what I mean?  Like, it would be like Kyle doing a solo thing.  Right, yeah, I did sing a song on this record called The Way, yeah. 
[03:47:00]  All right, there you go.  Yeah, you know, and this, like, I'm cautious with this conversation, too, because it's  like, I know that, like, journalists want to run with it.  It's like, you know what I mean?  Because, like, Keith's had such chart success.  So it's like, if this record, because it was so collaborative, if we don't have hits and it's  not successful, it's going to be because we wrote songs together.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's that classic thing, like, oh, the bass player brought a song in and  we had to cut it because he's in the band and we hang out a lot.  You know what I mean?  Like, I certainly don't want that to happen because, like, I've been living in Nashville 
[03:47:30]  for six years and I see so many wonderfully talented songwriters collaborating all the  time, songs that we all know and love.  And, you know, so it's like, it's exciting for me to, for us to finally get to that place  creatively in a band.  And, but at the same time, like I said, I'm cautious because this record is really sort  of do or die for us, you know what I mean?  As far as a collaborative effort.  If it does well, I still plan on taking all the credit for it, though.  I'll still take all the credit for it.  Hey, do you guys get, like, resentful? 
[03:48:00]  Because there's a, there's a great, one of my favorites.  He doesn't even need the second part of that.  I don't give it in general.  No, there's a great Pink Floyd song called When the Tigers Broke Free, which I've talked  about.  But that, I heard, didn't make it onto the album because they felt it was too personal.  And I'm like, he wrote it about his father.  And I'm like, is there stuff that you guys write that you think should make it on a dozen?  And then you kind of resent everybody for not seeing your, like, it's got to be so hard  to be in a four-way marriage like that.  For a second.  You know what I mean?  Just a little bit of that.  Like when you first bring a song, I mean, you, I think it's because like you spend all  this time on it alone. 
[03:48:30]  You're really excited about it.  You're, you're connected to it.  You bring it in, you play it for the band.  You've got this look of optimism across your face.  And, and as soon as you play it, you can just feel the, the, you know, the air.  Everybody's looking at you just like, yeah, you know, and that hurts at first, but then,  you know, after a while you start looking at it and you're like, well, but all these  decisions have been for the better.  Like the song that came after that was a better song or the, the reason they told me to go  back and rewrite it, they were right.  I found a better chorus.  I made this better, you know?  So I think it, it only works if you've been friends for, you know, 15, 20 years like we 
[03:49:00]  have, because you have that freedom to say that sucks.  And you know, it's coming from, it's not just coming from some guy you work with.  It's coming from one of your friends that you trust their musical opinion.  So at the end of the day, even if you get upset, I'm like, it makes you think, well,  shit, if Kyle was listening to it, that means in his home, he just wouldn't like that song.  And what, you know, why should we make a song as a band that somebody in the band wouldn't  listen to?  And you obviously respect what Kyle has to say.  Well, kind of.  Well, I was just, I mean, you know, it is, it is props to him because it's not lost on me that  I realized that he can go and get a rad New York band and go into a studio and make 
[03:49:30]  whatever record he wants to make, you know?  But at the end of the day, it's not going to have the personality that we all fight  for.  You know what I mean?  Because I've worked with session musicians and I know how that goes.  They go, they're great.  They go in, but they don't have a vision for your song.  I mean, you know what I mean?  Like we all, I feel like, like we treat songs like mini epics.  Like if you knew, like we, we, we build a song up, we tear it back down.  We rewrite it again.  It's like, it becomes a reggae song.  It's like, there's like a salsa break.  Oh no.  Okay.  There's not that.  Then it's a hip hop song. 
[03:50:00]  That's whatever.  Cause we're just trying to find, you know, the right skin for that song.  And I just think that's, that's what differentiates a band from a solo artist, you know, a lot,  a lot of times or a sort of producer slash solo artist, you know, there's a lot of that  these days on the clock when it comes to session guys.  Yeah.  And you, you have to say, this is what I want you to do.  I want you to try this.  I mean, they're going to bring their personality, which is why you bring certain guys, but it's  not going to be like, I think maybe because they don't have, they don't have the vested  interest in it that you're a member of that band. 
[03:50:30]  I mean, this is your livelihood.  They're getting paid to, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You guys ever have a, any massive fucking blowout in a studio or anything?  Just those good yelling matches.  Sure.  Paul quit the band on the floor one time when we were making Mad Season.  It was great.  I believe it was overbent because if you listen to the song, like you can, there's this big  sort of like Tom fill in the middle of it.  And, and Rob felt that it was destroying a song.  I hate it.  I hate it.  And here's the thing.  Paul was, Charles, you know, Paul's trying to make it not gay or something like that. 
[03:51:00]  Whatever it was.  And now it's one of the coolest parts on the record.  Like, it's so cool that it's like this distinguishable, you know, part with the drum part, which you  don't have a lot, but it's that.  And I'm just like, dude, you're killing my fucking song.  Yeah.  You're killing it.  And we all like almost came to blows.  Fucking song's gay without it, man.  What the fuck?  Like a few months later, I'm just like, oh, by the way, that's a really cool part.  It was so, it was so dramatic because it was like, you know, his drum kit was like set  across the floor of this huge room. 
[03:51:30]  So the sticks go flying.  It's like, I quit, man.  It's like kind of saunches across this thing.  And then it's like the door slams.  We're all just still, we still got the headphones on.  We're just looking at each other like.  Give that final tap line out.  This is all we fucking need.  And then he came back like an hour later.  I felt like Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights.  And I'm like, dude, the drums are taking away from my vocals.  They're definitely taking away from my vocals.  I felt like him for other reasons in that movie.  These guys got to go on for some.  Yeah, they're telling us that we have to wrap up.  Jerk off in front of a guy in a truck. 
[03:52:00]  Absolutely.  This is great.  This is great.  Yeah, man.  What can we play for the record for you guys?  The record North comes out today.  Oh, I don't know.  Matchbox 20.  Throw a dart and try something.  No, no.  What are you pushing?  Are you pushing?  Yeah, I'm sure the label would like.  The single right now is a song called She's So Mean.  Yeah, let's do that to at least start.  And then we can play other ones down the road for you.  Rob Thomas and Kyle Cook from Matchbox 20.  Good to see you guys again, man.  Absolutely.  Thank you guys.  It was a pleasure, man.  It was a pleasure, brother.  Thank you so much, man.  You want to do this now?  You want to do the song? 
[03:52:30]  Do the song first.  All right, he's just got to do some business.  God, well, you know what?  I'm not going to yell at anything because it's wonderful.  It's a television provider called Dish.  Right?  And they believe value.  Oh, it's more than just getting more for less.  Right?  How about quality?  Oh, they have packages with more channels that you want to watch, more of the most innovative  features of TV.  What about the hopper, the DVR?  You could record up to four rooms in your house.  How about that? 
[03:53:00]  Delivers programming to four rooms in your house.  Record all four networks of primetime TV automatically.  And you just got to press one button.  You're never going to miss your favorite shows again.  Technology's great, but value, oh, it's about the price.  Ask about the packages starting at just $19.99 a month.  You're going to find something that fits you for just the right price.  Stop paying for TV and call DISH, 888-770-DISH, 888-770-3474.  DISH.  Let's watch TV.  All right.  And Kyle Cook and Rob Thomas still in the studio.  That was a little weird.  Matchbox 20, the new CD is North. 
[03:53:30]  It's out today on iTunes, Amazon, everywhere.  And we're going to play the first single from the record for these guys.  All right.  Thank you, guys.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow.  Matchbox 20, everyone.  Thank you so much, man.  All right.  I know a girl, she gets what she wants all the time, cause she's fine.  But for an angel, she's a hot, hot mess.  Make you so blind, but you don't mind. 
[03:54:00]  Cause she's an old town, get around, anything goes.  A girl, a girl.  She's a hardcore candy store, give me some more.  A girl, a girl.  She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends.  She likes to stay late at the party, cause the fun never ends.  And all her clothes are on the floor, and all your records are scratched.

Yeah, you want her, but she's so mean.  You'll never let her go.  Why don't you let her go?  You wanna know that, if you don't shut your mouth, she'll freak out.  You better get your butt together, cause she's bringing her down now. 
[03:55:00]  And boy, you better, you better, cause she's an old town, get around, anything goes.  A girl, a girl.  She's a hardcore, can't be strong, give me some more.  A girl, a girl.  She's got a wicked sense of humor, can't believe what she says.  She drinks McCartney in the morning till it goes to her head. 
[03:55:30]  And all you want is just to hold her, but she don't go for that.  She has a hard time, call me when she can't hit back.  Say, yeah, you want her, but she's so mean.  You'll never let her go.  Why don't you let her go?  Yeah, you want her, but she's so mean.  You'll never let her go.  Why don't you let her go?  Every now and then she makes you just a little bit crazy. 
[03:56:00]  She'll turn the knife into your back and then she's calling you bleeding crazy.  She'll make you take her to the club, but then she leaves with her friends. 
[03:56:30]  She likes to steal it at the party cause the fun never ends.  And all her clothes are on the floor and all your records are scratched.  She's like a one-way ticket cause she can't come back.  Say, yeah, you want her, but she's so mean.  You'll never let her go.  Why don't you let her go?  Yeah, you want her, but she's so mean.

[03:57:30]  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Strap in.  After Opie and Anthony Live.  I would give out the phone number, but I don't think we have time.  How long is this show going to be today, Eric?  Looks like five minutes.  Okay, five minutes.  It's all right.  We've got a lot of ground to cover in five minutes.  I don't know if we're going to get to all of it.  If there is something you'd like us to cover, or if you want to do it, what did you learn?  I guess you can.  866-WOW-1-WOW is the phone number. 
[03:58:00]  Big, big show day today.  This was like, what do we have planned for the rest of the week?  This was a week's worth of shows in one day.  Sal's in here not doing a good job instructing these interns, by the way, Eric, just so you know.  He's not, if you're looking for somebody to be the next head of the interns, Sal is a terrible, terrible teacher.  Sam, I said one of you guys go do the phones, and you're on air.  He just goes, both of us?  How many people does it take to operate a fucking phone?  No, did you actually phrase it by saying one of you guys go do the phone? 
[03:58:30]  Both of us?  And the question back was both of us.  No.  All I heard was go do the phones.  Oh.  Maybe that's your problem, Sal.  Maybe you're not communicating properly.  No, that's not the case.  Why don't you go do the phones?  Before you're on.  You're crying.  Sorry.  It's just a funny response.  Oh, boy.  They're not happy that you made fun of them, either.  This is not turning out well.  Do we have anything planned the rest of the week, Eric? 
[03:59:00]  You know what?  I'm not 100% sure.  No, I don't think we do.  I think we kind of blew our load today because we had, what?  Usually the day back from a vacation is kind of a more relaxed atmosphere.  Yeah.  We'll talk about what went on during the time off, people who died during our time off,  news stories.  We had Jeffrey Rush in here, who's like an iconically good actor.  Matchbox 20 was in here.  They sold like 15 million albums.  Nobody sells any albums anymore.  They've sold 15 million of them. 
[03:59:30]  Well, that's when they still were making albums.  I guess so, but now they still are.  They got another one out, and they're still, like, how they're still on, like, they're  still on Hits 1 actively.  Not just, like, as a favor.  Like, they're on Hits 1 all of the time still.  What else was going on?  Jim Florentine in here, his rant, he said something that made me laugh so hard.  When he first started talking about fantasy football, and he just did this sort of douchey  guy who plays fantasy football voice and says, we're going to get some snacks. 
[04:00:00]  This is just, because that's what that guy would be excited about, the fact that there  were going to be some friends over, and they were going to have snacks.  Lady Trucker wants to do a What Did You Learn Real Quick.  What's up, Lady Trucker?  Hey, Sam.  Well, today I learned one of the interns' names is number two.  That's true.  Eric refused to name the interns today.  Rick in Ohio.  Yeah, somebody should tell Anthony that that hair dye, you're not supposed to put it on your  pussy.  Is that what happened to Anthony's eye, he put too much hair dye on his pussy? 
[04:00:30]  Yeah, we got the Anthony hair dye story, he just kind of squeezed it in there, and, oh,  and, uh, Jim Florentine's new CD, you can get it on iTunes, it's called Awful Jokes from  My First Notebook, something like that.  Just look up Awful Jokes Jim Florentine.  From his first comedy notebook.  Yeah, look it up, it's on iTunes.  What a great idea.  He's putting out a CD where he's just, he found his, his notebook of where he put his  first, like, jokes that he wrote when he was first starting a comedy, and they're all  horrible.  And he just read them. 
[04:01:00]  He's just dictating them.  I love that some of them do have commentary, like, I didn't actually say that.  Um, alright.  We've arrested, oh yeah, My Honeymoon, I'm not as cheap as they think I am.  I had a wonderful time.  It was relaxing.  It was great.  Uh, it was something that I'll remember forever.  E-Rock, what's the final word on the intern situation?  Have you actually quit, or were you just saying that because you were tired of them riding  you?  No, I said it, but we'll see if that happens tomorrow.  What do you mean, this is why it drives people crazy. 
[04:01:30]  What do you mean, we'll see if that happens?  To be concluded.  What are you talking about?  Question mark.  So you don't know if you're quitting or not?  No, I want to quit.  You don't, you don't know if they will let you quit.  Is that what I'm hearing?  We'll see how talks go.  Management may not let you quit.  Maybe you're holding out for money.  Who knows?  Who knows?  You don't, obviously.  At this point, anything's possible.  No, it's not.  It's either you're going to be the intern guy or you're not going to be the intern guy.  Two things are possible.  Anything is not possible at all. 
[04:02:00]  You got very upset with them today.  I left on that note, and then I return on that note.  Well, because you left on the note saying, I am quitting, and then you return on that note  saying, I am the boss of the intern.  I never said that.  I never said that.  You never said, wait, which one did you never say?  I never said I'm the boss of the interns today.  But you are.  I never said that.  But are you?  This came up because they didn't know how to take a phone call.  So you're saying nobody is in charge of the interns, right?  Intern.  You.  Yeah. 
[04:02:30]  What's your name?  That's intern number one.  Okay, intern number one.  What's your name?  Gio.  Gio?  Yeah.  Like the letters?  Like Nat?  G-I-O.  It's short for Juliana.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're out of time.  We have to go.  Nat Gio.  Who's in charge of you?  Um, well, Sal was because Iraq wasn't here, and then now apparently Iraq.  Oh my God.  Things are falling apart.  No, I'm not going to hold on.  I'm going to end the show instead.  Stay tuned.  Ryan and Fez are coming up next.  This show has just devolved into chaos.  Stay tuned for a real show. 
[04:03:00]  It's going to be in a few minutes.  Goodbye.  Opie and Anthony's show is now over.  For real this time. </pre>
