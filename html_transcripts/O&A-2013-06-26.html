<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, beginning with a recounting of the hosts' experience filming a scene for a Chris Rock movie.  Rosario Dawson was present, and the segment highlighted the technical challenges, particularly with audio, and the unexpected prominence of their intern, Sam Roberts, who remained in the shot throughout.  The hosts also commented on Chris Rock's reaction to co-host Eric's outfit and lamented the exclusion of female interns from the final cut.

The show then shifted to a detailed discussion of Alex Rodriguez's tweet about his recovery and Brian Cashman's profane response, with the hosts speculating on the underlying tension between A-Rod and the Yankees organization.  This transitioned into a critique of John Sterling's Yankee home run calls, focusing on the "Gardy goes yardy" phrase, and a caller's unsuccessful attempt to defend Sterling's style.  A lengthy and rambling phone call with "Lady Die" followed, encompassing her job search struggles, daily routines, alcohol consumption, and her planned return to the show, which left the hosts and listeners exasperated.  The hosts frequently interrupted her with jokes and insults.

Rich Vos joined the show as a guest, expressing frustration over his perceived lack of inclusion in Jeff Ross's Comedy Central roast specials despite contributing material.  The conversation meandered through Vos's experiences on *Tattoo Nightmares*, his own tattoos, a listener's tattoo of his name, golf (specifically the US Open), and various celebrities including Sammy Hagar, Ozzy Osbourne, and Rob Zombie.

Larry King then joined the show, generating considerable excitement.  The conversation encompassed King's career, including anecdotes from interviewing numerous presidents (Nixon, Reagan, Bush, Clinton, Carter, Bush Jr., Obama, and Ford), his heart attacks and bypass surgery,  and his views on current events, particularly Obama's presidency and the Supreme Court's ruling on Proposition 8 (with Opie adding a humorous hypothetical Supreme Court opinion).  The conversation also included crude and offensive language.

The conversation with Larry King continued, transitioning to Nick Walenda's Grand Canyon tightrope walk, other famous high-wire acts (Philippe Petit and George Willig), Kingâ€™s personal life (including his children, wife's age difference, and HGH use), and his commercial endorsements.  Jim Norton and an unidentified "web guy" or "Buana of the Jungle" were also present. A debate on gun control, spurred by a discussion of the Second Amendment, featured contrasting perspectives from Larry King.

Nick Walenda himself joined the show to discuss his Grand Canyon walk in detail, the challenges, safety measures, and his family's history in tightrope walking.  He also promoted his book, *Balance*, and discussed potential future walks.

The show then returned to a discussion of Walenda's physical fitness, his book, and online hate. This segued into the George Zimmerman trial, the arrest of Aaron Hernandez, and a discussion about the "whitest city in America". The show moved on to listener calls covering a man dating a 32-year-old virgin, a man's rape fantasies, a comedian's use of recovery in his act, listeners' experiences with recovery and relationships, Ozzy Osbourne's drug use, difficult family relationships, and a man's struggles with relationships after 27 years of sobriety.  The hosts also promoted their podcast, mentioning segments with Max Cook, Tony Danza, and Dave Rabbit's Vietnam radio tapes.

The show concluded with more listener calls focusing on relationships and sex.  Bob from Oklahoma updated the hosts on his sexual relationship with his stepdaughter (the call was cut short due to poor connection), Chris from New Jersey expressed anxieties about his girlfriend's past sexual history, Louisiana Dave, a self-identified sex addict, discussed his compulsive behavior and infidelity, and AJ from California discussed his strained relationship with his alcoholic father.  The hosts offered advice throughout, employing a pragmatic approach to the callers' often sensitive and personal issues.  The segment, like much of the broadcast, contained candid and crude discussions of sex, addiction, and family issues.

[00:00:30]  it gets very uncomfortable one of the most popular shows in the world radio journalism  at its best hello kids it's the Opie and Anthony show they swear and they're vulgar and they talk  about awful awful things that's what you like isn't it very flavorful that's what you like  please welcome Opie the show is twisted I'm telling you we're enjoying this shit that's  what you like isn't it Anthony I want dick prizes I love when girls go through that I'm here for  you ladies remember that that's what you like isn't it and Jim Norton if a pussy could talk it would say 
[00:01:00]  die that's what you like isn't it everything you are about to hear is real  good morning welcome aboard let's get the show on the road yes let's do that good morning 
[00:01:30]  everybody the hell's this about what very very tinny tinny yeah how's that yeah is that a little  better is that a little better well I guess it's gonna have to do a little tinny a little uh distorting  sounding I don't know whenever they fuck around with this stuff like they unplugged the mics yesterday  put the uh plug it into the the mixing board for Chris Rock's uh movie thing for the big movie shoot 
[00:02:00]  yeah and uh when did you realize that together when did you realize that we were gonna be maybe  five seconds of a montage of a montage I knew I kind of knew that that's what it was gonna be  still cool as hell but it was fun as you're going through it you start realizing what they were uh trying  to capture yeah it's gonna be one of those things where you know it's gonna be very quickly cut I 
[00:02:30]  think Chris Rock's character doing a whole bunch of radio interviews it's gonna be around here  so hopefully uh hopefully a couple of us get our faces on in the movie yeah hopefully we get our logo  in the movie yeah because even the production staff is going oh it's too bad you know it's too bad because  there's a lot of funny stuff going on in there right now yeah yeah they actually said it's too bad  because they obviously weren't filming a a long form scene with us no they they they would film  about you know 20 minutes 30 minutes we did 40 40 minutes of us uh having an interview but it's 
[00:03:00]  going to be cut with other shows that he was doing interviews with and very quickly yes you know ask a  question get an answer boom back to another interview with someone else bam back and forth kind of a  betcha on the big screen it's maybe a minute I mean a minute for everybody's interviews  so out of that minute then if we get maybe 10 or 15 seconds that'd be cool shit it's still cool  enough time for fucking screen cap that's right enough time for screen cap it was weird because 
[00:03:30]  they took the audio and put it in through the movie uh yeah whatever I'm talking about child  through the movie thing but I it was hard to hear because I couldn't even wear my headphones  because yeah we usually we can catch each other in this right and you you said something it  sounded like that to me oh really it's so weird hearing you talk very low yeah yeah with no uh  no amplification through the uh headphones well it was a little movie magic yeah it was we were we 
[00:04:00]  were in the middle of movie magic yeah because you had to wear the headphones because we have to look  like radio dicks but they weren't connected to anything that was like working that's where the movie  magic comes in because they took our microphones unplugged them and plugged them into the mixing board  that they had but no one sees us with headphones on so we should have probably done the whole thing  without headphones on yeah because i don't know what is it a continuity thing they wanted it to look  like we had headphones on chris rock was cool as hell though man yeah that was a blast man i feel 
[00:04:30]  like we turned the corner with chris rock finally i feel like he's gonna become a regular on the show  now he's pal now i think so because we really really were having a good time with him and he was just so  cool yeah i mean he's been in here you know off and on but i i just feel like yesterday was a big  step forward for our relationship with chris rock as far as the radio show goes i'm not i'm not  expecting to pal around with the guy or anything yeah although i do have some uh some chit chat with  him at the gym every once in a while oh this is lockers in the very pretty much right next to me  actually oh really yeah it's in the same it's in the same uh whatever and then um that's just 
[00:05:00]  bragging sorry rosario dawson was in here also she is so hot she looks very pretty oh she was uh  that's anthony liking a girl most by the way she's uh she was uh yeah she was uh sitting in a seat i  guess they had her in the background she well who is she is she supposed to be the girlfriend  she's a love interest the fiancee in the movie that we probably shouldn't talk too much about  so at one point she was sitting in a chair and she was in camera view and i guess oh she was 
[00:05:30]  yeah yeah they had her sitting over here yeah uh and the camera that was oh i thought she was just  hanging no she was yeah at first she was then they put her makeup on and everything and she was uh  in the shot oh i thought she was just kind of hanging checking it all out because we had probably  20 people in here in this tiny little fucking closet my favorite part of this whole thing yeah  was the fact that um our own sam roberts who had no expectations no fucking preconceived notions 
[00:06:00]  about being in this right movie and and and participating in our our little scene here  was sitting uh at the computer per usual right and uh didn't get up to move well he's not stupid  he's just oh i'll never say that sam roberts is stupid the fact of the matter is if he got up to  leave no one was going to tell him hey hey hey right get back in that seat right but he didn't get up 
[00:06:30]  to move so the assumption was made by the production staff that sam roberts is an integral part of this  program and and if if there's going to be filming of this program he needs to be in the scene  presto chango he's in the fucking movie that's the correct assumption i am integral to every part of  the opening well there you go and you had to fill out all the paperwork oh yeah you just and you just  got paid yeah hell yeah you got a day's pay as by the way eric who dressed in his nice polo shirt 
[00:07:00]  with his collar hold on hold on what is eric wearing today what is eric just to compare  eric sam look at the glass you know what he did what he did he wants to give himself the benefit  of a doubt yesterday so he's fading away from the look he's wearing a polo shirt what an asshole  what an asshole what a fake you're fading away from it slowly hoping no one notices he's very smart 
[00:07:30]  though to think to not just come in with a simpsons shirt right right because then we'd be all over  right man eric is is you're you're calculating plausible deniability you calculate shit man  that's creepy you you knew if you put a simpsons shirt on the beating would be much worse  but now we're aware that you're kind of just fading out of the uh the hollywood look from  yesterday eric always wears these we told chris rock by the way and and chris uh rolled his eyes  oh he made a face like oh because we were telling uh chris rock about how eric dressed up 
[00:08:00]  hoping that he might be you know in the background or something and chris rock  he rolled his eyes yeah yeah and gave a kind of a kind of uh a chuckle yeah he's in between takes  too is the whole crew was in here oh right they were all laughing you had to bring up wow  by the way chris eric wore uh oh he loved that eric so you had a look through the window there  right at sam roberts who was in the movie uh that should have been you that should have been you 
[00:08:30]  that should have been you you were dressed and you were perfect the director had requested eric i  believe he saw the shirt and you know what anyone that sat in that seat by the way was going to be  in the movie right it didn't have to be you travis it could have been it could have been one of the  girls or they could have just pushed the chair aside or they could have pushed the chair aside  because at one point they were like hmm we need the camera guy there that's when i knew that i was 
[00:09:00]  in good shape yeah because at the second take they go we need the camera guy there and i was like well  you guys want me to just get out of there and the guy goes no we need you there for continuity  because they already they already yeah we're in the first you're in the first part of it you can't  you were like a coffee cup they had to make sure the coffee cup was in the same exact  fucking place valuable yeah for the scene by the way how dumb are we to not have one of the girls  there yes sam exactly we really are dumb i know how dare you take up a spot that one of the jackie 
[00:09:30]  or sydney they've been there two weeks exactly they're made for the motion pictures that would  have been great they're off for they've been here three weeks now three weeks two weeks how do you  know how long they've been i just have a good feeling about these things exactly imagine that an intern  three weeks in and they're in the fucking movie of chris part of the opian anthony show that would  have been classic the whole staff is just watching them every year seething let's make it perfectly 
[00:10:00]  clear we're gonna we're gonna be barely in this movie oh i know but you know what it was very  exciting and fun yeah to be part of of course it was and then it happened the the crew of the movie  are all fans of the show fans of the way way back it was great a lot of fun that's for sure  yeah it was it was a trip well iraq uh and how was it for you iraq oh great any uh any observations  took a while yeah it did take a while man was it always does those things uh wow

[00:11:00]  couple minutes on film and they were here all fucking day who's reagan playing i think his lawyer  manager or something it was weird when you guys were done we were walking down the hallway and that  little remote studio on the side where a lot of the political talk goes it's reagan and chris rock as we're  walking past reagan is angry like his arms are flailing he's yelling chris is just sitting there  on the other side so i don't know what the scene entails oh but it's a pissed off brian oh my god  great to never see that ha ha cole nice brian and the uh the movie company made this big fancy 
[00:11:30]  serious xm sign that's in the lobby that lights up oh did they do that yeah the movie company did it  but and uh this isn't us saying this some people here that work here posted photos of it's you  saying it just say oh yeah oh you're a fucking lawyer now no shut up i'm sorry so the the sign  out there they're posting photos of the sign saying the movie company's trying to sell that sign  to our company right they're not just going to like give it to us because it has our logo no they want 
[00:12:00]  to sell it how much they want for it that i don't know but i saw it up on twitter and instagram  yesterday i bet it's thousands of dollars expensive yeah it's got neon light on it and  shit all right greenstein will figure out how to get that for free yeah then sign they have no idea  who they're tangling with yes because he's been in the movie business too so he understands those  guys that's where he comes from and he also realizes what what are they going to do with this  they could either smash it or keep it here for free yeah greenstein knows that shit  so thank you for the present yeah yeah he'll have them he'll have them he'll have them paying

[00:13:00]  a little eye candy yeah right should have been some eye candy in that seat you wanted jackie in  the chair that would have been nice or sydney the two of them just crammed into the chair together  both of them on each other making house right just petting each other softly oh that's funny  anyway so that was fun yeah good times yeah names and uh yeah as i said sam fucking filling out 
[00:13:30]  the paperwork at the end was great we're all sitting here filling out our our paperwork there's  a lot of fucking paperwork you gotta fill out when you're done with those things all kinds of releases  and fucking legal things and pay forms and shit like that so we're all sitting here filling them  out and i was just thinking that eric is right there on the other side of the glass the closest  person to him through the glass is sam and he's watching sam fill out his his movie paperwork it's not  like you felt bad i mean you were the one who was being the meanest of all eric walked in here when 
[00:14:00]  we were done and one of the camera guys wanted to take a photo with him because he was a big fan  and anthony goes oh look eric's finally in front of a camera  that is a mean thing to say eric you didn't go home sad did you no i just went home  oh yeah so all right i i just want to say brian cashman is the greatest guy ever wow this is kind 
[00:14:30]  of funny huh did he call up a radio station and curse was it on a radio station i haven't heard any  audio of it happening yet brian cashman and the yankees have finally had it with a rod yeah i mean  i'm sure they've had it with a rod a while ago but they're finally making it known public yeah uh to  everyone else they've had it with this guy i guess a rod it was a pretty innocent tweet he just kind  of tweeted that you know the doctor cleared him for uh rehab games i guess yeah that's all he 
[00:15:00]  tweeted uh-huh and brian cashman uh where did he say this i need to know basically it was he  said that a rod needs to shut the fuck up that's the quote that's the quote the yankee organization  likes to announce these things apparently they don't want the players announcing when a player's  coming back from the dl things like that uh you're you're you're you're you're reading this wrong  no no i understand what you're saying but i think that was his motivation yeah but this has a lot to do 
[00:15:30]  with everything else that led up to that tweet i bet you if it's a normal player and he fucks up a  little bit like this i understand policy through behind the scenes they would let it go like you know  what you probably shouldn't have fucking tweeted that but they've had it with this guy so they  use that to say he needs to shut the fuck up exactly yeah behind the scenes they would have  said this cut any other player a rod has cut deep these guys fucking hate him but that was the re  that was the reason um that he said it but he didn't have to say it like that it was a boiling 
[00:16:00]  point obviously yeah he told it to a espn new york reporter oh just a reporter yeah was it in  official capacity or no were they just chatting oh maybe it was off the record i think i think  i think uh that's how jesse jackson got in trouble no i think it was on the record i think i honestly  think cashman finally fucking had it yeah yeah the the tweet was visit from dr kelly over the weekend  who gave me dude you're okay dude yeah you go there boom you pick the bat up you hit it you run 
[00:16:30]  boom boom who gave me uh what does it say the best news the green light to play games again see  that's kind of an innocent tweet uh-huh sure maybe it goes against some policy but it usually that  doesn't deserve a he deserve a you need to shut the fuck up no he doesn't like it wasn't off the  record cashman finally finally said you know what enough enough with this guy i guess they're stuck with  his contract right they would love to fucking get rid of him yeah you gotta think yeah it's a lot of 
[00:17:00]  money and he's just been a pain in the ass and the choke meister in the playoffs and and the paper had  to bleep out the part how good you know how many papers paper bleep it out i mean that they just put  in the little asterisk yeah but what does the front page say you got it right in front of you  right there the front page oh front page yeah here it is shut the up yeah cashman's vulgar 
[00:17:30]  tirade a tirade over star's tweet how great would that be if you saw fuck on the front page of the  paper though oh boy who would who would have a problem with that that would be and what would  that mean in the end so offensive they don't have to answer to anyone the newspaper do they what of  the chill maybe the advertisers their advertisers what of the children you got anything else on this  travis well since we're talking about the yankees i i pulled uh i pulled something for you and then i 
[00:18:00]  gave you a little bonus your pud yeah every morning is it a is it the one thing that's so douchey  and then you found another douchey thing well yeah then i found another one that i just track one is  the the first douchey thing that we talked about yeah okay yeah the one one swung on hit in the air  to deep right that ball is high notice far and it is gone wreck gardner connected and drove one deep  in the lower deck and right gardner plants one in the right field seats gardie goes yardy 
[00:18:30]  oh did you see i got i said yardy i got horrid goosebumps from that one guard gardner is gardie  now gardie goes yardy who in the yankee organization likes this no one it fucking sucks publicly they all  will say they love it you talk to the yankee players yankees put yeah the yankee players and they 
[00:19:00]  they all say they love it not one guy will step forward and say how douchey that is so said all  right  i had to steal that one jesus thank you sir that's like something a six-year-old would say  maybe not even a six-year-old yeah four and a half oh sure yay  terrible wow so there was another home run an inning later so i was like you know what while 
[00:19:30]  i'm here yeah we haven't done sterling uh home run calls in a while i might as well check it out  because this next guy doesn't really hit home runs a lot so let's see oh say and then maybe somebody  tags it at the end oh no they're still working together i don't even know oh god i don't even  know they're still working together those two he's so terrible i can't listen to yankee games anymore  i've stopped listening to yankee games because he's so awful yardy could be one of the worst ones 
[00:20:00]  ever you can't say yardy oh and jason nicks swings and drives one deep to left field down the line  on the run is murphy to the wall she's gone jason nicks hit a long high fly that went about two or  three rows back and nicks knock nicks knock he holders  case it jason and the yankees have time  oh what what's the second home run oh oh wait oh i love how that voice just cuts like a knife 
[00:20:30]  what the fuck was he saying  nicks nicks nicks knock nicks knock nicks knock is the knock knock yeah oh and he says it twice  nicks knock nicks knock nicks knock doesn't make sense it's stupid oh because the other ones do i know  and then what else did he say after the nicks knock i went backwards let's find out all right 
[00:21:00]  then he got that crow fucking popping in  back and nicks knock nicks knock he hovers  hasten jason and the yankees have tied the game at three well it's his second home run of the season  robbie cano's laughing and they and they just had a big hug in the dugout i guess  and he's getting in trouble with that slider god she just gets moist i love it she can't get enough 
[00:21:30]  for the yankees he's laughing at the dugout she gives the inside dugout scoop yes no one can see  unless they have eyes or watching the same set she's watching what an idiot everyone just ignores her  heavy boston accent she's my favorite person in the world you like her can you have someone with a heavy  boston accent calling yankees yankees games oh it's fucking fantastic  give him hugs who cares they're hugging in the locker room or something  what's wrong with sterling nick snock and they all will just praise him and say they love his home run calls 
[00:22:00]  oh yeah yeah of course  that's it that's great um that's good call that's good stuff good stuff right there damn good stuff  well we'll see what happens with the a-rod situation nothing he's just gonna shut the 
[00:22:30]  fuck up yeah well yeah he's been asked to oh that's right yeah oh wow he's been asked to shut  the fuck up but a-rod's such an asshole he won't shut the fuck up so this is gonna be kind of terrific  this is gonna get good i think yeah that's great that they've had it with him they hate him they do  right i mean that's that's so very un-brian cashman to say that that just gives you uh a peek into his  mind as to how much he really doesn't that was an off-the-cuff statement you know that like wasn't 
[00:23:00]  thought out and and that's that's how much he hates was he just talking like guys will do  and go i wish he'd shut the fuck up no man he doesn't talk like that no but i mean not realizing  that the guy was in a quota oh no he's he no he just had it it's so obvious yeah they were he's  finally had it he's had it he should just shut the fuck up and then he says something like i gotta go  call him right now i'm gonna call him right now oh yeah you know what i think uh do-do-do cotton  uniforms what you may have something there team's cooler out there you may you may have 
[00:23:30]  something there george oh i got something i love that team's cooler out there oh it's so fucking  good oh let me say hi to nick he has a little more on the a-rod thing nick on long island what's up nick  good morning boys nick snogs  the reason why cashman flipped out on a-rod is because the day before cashman came out saying  that no updates on a-rod have been given we don't know when he's coming back and then a-rod opens his 
[00:24:00]  fat fucking mouth saying that he's coming back and now he makes cashman a douche are you a big  yankees fan nick a little bit have you had it with a-rod uh yes you think most fans have had it  with a-rod i would say um for years the true yankee fans say yes because he's fucking overpaid  he's a he's a distraction off the field and he's a fucking waste yeah right on all right sir thanks  nick and then we got someone that wants to defend john sterling how are you gonna defend john sterling 
[00:24:30]  he's a wonderful man yeah he's uh magnificent to work with look at him there he is  the sound of his voice gets my pussy stuck in his seat i'd rather have a crow peck in my head  she's terrible holy fuck uh wait we haven't even introduced you or nothing i'm trying to figure out  your name because it says charler on the on the fucking charler is a charlie all right i figured it 
[00:25:00]  might be charlie all right what do you got listen i i i listen to the games just about every night  um and i didn't i actually for whatever it's worth i've enjoyed the the sterling home run calls  for years i've been a lifelong yankee fan and i know you guys rip them apart you don't and you don't  like it and every time he comes up with a new one um i end up tweeting what he said to one of you guys 
[00:25:30]  i did i did one the other day that i think to jimmy uh when zuelo amante the rookie in his first  career home run wait you actually enjoy him or you're just goofing you know you can't you like  you like guardy went yardy well i'll give you that one that was a little douchey do you have special  needs some of the other ones some of the other ones that he's had have actually they've been pretty 
[00:26:00]  good um you know i i i don't know it's it's tough to explain and and it's gotten to the point where  his home run calls have a life of their own now no they don't you don't notice you don't notice  that he's shoehorning it in and all of a sudden it becomes ridiculously awkward his home run call  itself is is as definitely is is how it's good now he does too i wasn't even gonna say it's excellent  but his home run calls are are good it's good broadcasting and then he stops everything to 
[00:26:30]  throw in all that nonsense to make it about him right yeah but it's gotten to the point now where  it's it's not i don't think it's just the bad hand when when let me explain did you hear nick nick  knock knock nick nick it stops everything nick knock knock no that's not you you could hear the edit  where the home run call should end it's like okay right there very good you did your job a nice home  run call and then all of a sudden this fuck it it's like a car flying off the highway 
[00:27:00]  what's happened is that it's gone to a point and the reason why i say it's it's it's taken on a life  of its own when when whenever there's a new player that comes to the yankees and god knows they've had  a lot this year because of all the injuries uh they've even talked about it on the air where  they'll say the guys in the press box are already speculating as to what sterling's home run oh my god 
[00:27:30]  why they're probably mocking doing this that's what they do they actually they're and you know  that gets them off that gets them nice and hard he goes oh look everyone's wondering what i'm gonna  come up with i think i'm gonna say guard he goes yardy that should that should kill i'll never see that  they're probably making fun of him yeah they have to be making the reason why we get excited  dude he's terrible and he's a great play-by-play guy but that fuck it's it makes it about him if 
[00:28:00]  there were no home runs in yankee games he'd be a great he'd be amazing i live i live in a lonely  world because i think maybe fucking we're we're off base and the majority of people enjoy the the  stupid guard he goes yardy and they are you can you can you can call me a douche if you want all right  you're a douche all right i want to do a game and one of these guys uh puts one out especially if  it's if it's you know oh my god you're talking about exactly i don't even know how to hang up on you

[00:34:00]  hall of fame you see the part that says because of me because of me that's all we're taking this  call uh sydney oh oh sydney that's all right sir you gotta speak clearer yeah that's okay what are  you doing you know people make mistakes it's all right obviously the caller who gave erroneous  information wasn't being clear on the phone modeling his words yeah have to be uh clearer or she misheard  him which is okay because it gets loud in there when she's answering phones it's early it's fine 
[00:34:30]  very early in the morning you know how many phone screeners you've torn apart what are you talking  about sam this caller is an idiot yeah thank you sir nothing all right bernard so you're you just had  to call about piscopo being in the jersey hall of fame yeah because i know i know i'm not going to  put these balls now so you know take over we already knew that though yeah we're kind of leaving  him alone uh for now we're not busting joe piscopo's uh balls no we busted his balls enough 
[00:35:00]  but the joe piscopo saga is that this week or next week i forget already that is one week from today  okay every wednesday the uh the new opian anthony podcast comes out and next wednesday we already  fucking put it together because we're taking a week off um it's the whole joe piscopo saga starting  with um the time anthony came in to tell us all that he saw his showtime special the podcast that went  up this morning is a good one it's got they're all good man tony soprano calling from beyond the  grave with the ambient thing with of course you throw the ambient thing in there as well 
[00:35:30]  uh it's got the tony danza line which it's been years since anybody's heard that right and what's  the last thing on it it's the uh oh danza i was gonna say oh uh dave rabbit and the dave rabbit yeah the  dave rabbit tapes i i got that suggestion on my facebook page i said you know what yeah let's do this  the nom and you know the nom tapes when he was doing a radio show while he was in the nom you  know what else is on it we didn't you guys decided to pick the own a nugget an anthony nugget but we 
[00:36:00]  didn't i don't even know what it is you don't like the nugget hate the nugget love the nugget hate the  nugget love the nugget i had to i had to overrule sal this week's nugget is uh wait sal almost picked  the opian anthony nugget yeah what is that about i didn't let him i told him he doesn't have creative  input and i was a little scared because i saw that he was editing a little bit well he had some  downtime yesterday so we got to stay past our our normal hours and it was very strange to see sal at 
[00:36:30]  a computer actually editing yeah iraq you gave him that job uh don't think so who gave him the job then  he edits what we tell because iraq's a very good editor uh i trust the iraq with the uh the arc the  on a archives he's just a bad person and friend oh iraq definitely makes sal do a lot of editing  he does right yeah he outsource check his uh work there iraq i don't have anything to do with the  podcast oh also why are there no tissues in here but you've never mentioned it before wait why don't 
[00:37:00]  you have anything to do with the podcast i would love for you to do the whole fucking thing i was not  as far as the editing goes i wasn't asked i wasn't told anything about it oh boy oh no i just assumed we  were in good hands not saying that sal can't do a good job i don't know his words probably can't  you're saying he hasn't what has done good i'd assume he doesn't do a good job yeah with any  responsibility given him i know he's not good at production no who's that sal yeah he's not good 
[00:37:30]  on the phones yeah he needs help a good production he needs help constantly on the phones has i got a  call they want someone what do i do has he done any production yeah he did uh don't get the panda  angry  thank you so much look who brought in the tissues jackie yay the tissues have arrived you guys  throw a fit that the tissues aren't in usually all right sal so yes that's why i had 
[00:38:00]  i'm not saying you can't do it by the way but who gave you that job it was just  like all right all right we had a meeting there was a meeting right would you buy the five pack of  those shirts yes i have i have a lot of these shirts but eroc should be doing it that's where  that yesterday i don't want to pick these old bits we want eroc to go through quickly and maybe you know  it would fucking trim the fat out can i tell you the real reason sal was asked to do it yeah bite 
[00:38:30]  your tongue please i didn't say anything i just saw the look you went look and hands up like what  do you want me to do i don't think i was ever specifically asked i was just they they told me  to go to the meeting we discussed how it would be format all that sort of stuff and then the boss  i just understood that the bosses wanted sal to do it because when the bosses ask eroc to do  something he huffs and puffs to you please be honest he doesn't like dealing with it yes you do i'll 
[00:39:00]  laugh my ass you know costanza did a thing on seinfeld you look angry people think you're busy if you if  you like look angry right people think it's because you're busy so they leave you alone so why are you  why do you huff and puff because i don't always agree with the decisions being made so i i make it  known that i don't agree i love it and then whenever it gets done by somebody else yeah but i kind of we  kind of want you doing that yeah you're really good at that he's look i don't i'm not saying you're not 
[00:39:30]  sal i don't know you've done a good job oh wait sal's talking he has sal talking on the show is sort  of like the drum solo at a concert so i'm gonna blow my nose while he does that like as if it was drum  solo and i went to get a beer anthony saying that you wore the same shirt two days in a row i wore i  wore a gray one or blue one yesterday i i just like wearing vena by the way congratulations you almost  got my phone number the other day ah congratulations on that thank you mars doesn't have it either don't 
[00:40:00]  feel bad i was on i was on to your trickery though well i just i didn't have a commute a way to  communicate with you that was all and then i said sam give him my number and then sam saw me walking  away shaking my head finally like you figure out how you're not going to give him the number that's  okay i mean i didn't ask sam for it i didn't so i didn't look like the bad guy and it wasn't going  to happen so i didn't so i don't look like a bad guy until right now yeah but the the every time uh  eric has a job and one of the bosses says look i really want you to change how you're doing it to 
[00:40:30]  do it this way or that way you're again it's quite genius of him he huffs and puffs like nobody's  business i love it until somebody they leave him alone or they give the job to somebody else i love  it it's perfect i think it's great iraq i say keep doing that well look who i learned from  that was a compliment that wasn't oh you're awkward like when eric goes over the worst of list with uh  rob no i don't do that and stuff you're right because eric used to just go oh i didn't cut the head 
[00:41:00]  it was pretty funny actually no i've been i've been smarter than these guys forever  the bosses you mean yeah forever like since day one uh but you guys you're officially smarter than  them how does that feel i'm sure you're talking to iraq all of you guys are smarter than the guys  that babysit the channel how does that how does that feel as you walk around here be honest who wants  to start you know it's true yeah it's depressing you're trying to tell me that rob cross is smarter  than any one of you guys stop it he's a nice guy though i mean it's depressing it's sad right 
[00:41:30]  it's yeah iraq would you like to comment i'm filling out all your breakfast orders here  why are you guys scared to talk about it you know it's true you always say how stupid they are just  say it there is this uh like element of fear that goes into talking about management because technically  in the end they could you know get them fired i guess yeah that happen yeah i mean apparently  people do get fired for being assholes but oh well i've seen that happen you really you really 
[00:42:00]  got to fuck yourself you really got to be an asshole it's quite depressing yeah that fact  so comment believe it i'm working here guys it's a you know you think south smarter than the bosses yeah  yeah yeah holy yeah that's how bad they are yeah wow wow yes i do pretty good yes i do yeah  and you were showing me some fish pictures yesterday yeah just because we talked about  fish yesterday in the show yeah oh boy oh i didn't even but he but it's a very nice open invite to go

[00:43:00]  fucking they're just weird species creepy looking fish and they could take your arm off i guess i don't  like that sal's more willing to talk about fresh water fish than the other thing we just talked  about which was you asserting that he's smarter than his bosses well you know what are you gonna do  we got a special phone call coming in right now we got so many uh big celebrities coming in today wow  rich voss larry king nick wolenda looks like colin quinn and now we got a very special phone call hello

[01:05:00]  yeah  it was good  you know  the script  i had the script  you know  like three weeks ago  and  it's good  that's  you know  i wasn't playing golf  my golf game was out the window  so i just sat and worked on the script  and uh  you know  we'll see what gets in  they do so many different takes  you know  when they're  when they're doing these things  yeah we  take forever right  we filmed 40 minutes yesterday  we're not stupid  we know we'll be in the film  maybe for 5 to 10 seconds  no you'll be  no  because that scene  that scene  is a crucial scene 
[01:05:30]  the whole radio thing  you know  it'll be a montage  they did cancel  10 other shows though  jesus  because they went long with us  yeah  we just got that info  from somebody  you're  you're  there's a lot of pissed off people around here  fucking great  that was fun  it was great  that was good  we'll see  it's so good  you get to play yourselves  yeah  no script  it was so great  no script  no script  to learn  and the good thing is  because i mean  i've seen you  you're all horrible actors  yes  i'm a very good actor 
[01:06:00]  i'm a terrific actor too  jimmy he was talking to himself  it's okay  okay good  he's just talking amongst himself  fucking over actor  i was great as a security guy  in joe de rosa's little short film  oh right  huh  that's right  that's right  you were  yeah  i'm a terrific actor  next week  i'm a game show host  on amy schumer's show  wow  oh wow  next uh  next week  wow  she's put  everybody in that  everything  oh you're not in there rich  oh boy  she's not a big rich boss fan 
[01:06:30]  no  that's okay  why wouldn't she be  what does she have ears  come on  i saw yesterday  i was in the building  and i go  i'm going to take a piss  that's nice language  fucking uh  jeff ross walks in  and so uncomfortable  he's like hey  and i'm like  oh why are you talking to me  jeff ross  you have a problem with jeffrey  we were fucking like  best of friends  you know  i mean yeah 
[01:07:00]  i've written  from the same tribe  listen i've written  probably on seven roasts  we wrote on a roast  two or three roasts  together with me  and rich  yeah  i don't even think  we barely got paid  for the mtv one we did  i remember  i've written on tons  of roasts for him  stuff that was  quoted in the newspaper  for me  oh  i could tell you  but he got the credit  but he got credit  of course  but that's fine  if you write  that's all right  that's your job  writing sure  but that still has to be  a little frustrating  you think when he did the burn  i'd get a fucking call  even to 
[01:07:30]  even to say  hey  look at  uh  comedy central pass on you  which i can't see that happening  because i've done so much  sometimes the networks will say no though  like even though he's the guy  there's times where he might want to do something  where they just go  no we have to get this one  and this one  there are times where the network will just overpower you  i could see that  he didn't watch you on the show  i could see that the first  but the second  yeah he didn't watch you on the show  it's obvious  well  i'm a rich  after you've done so much  for somebody  and you know  when he first started comedy  i took him under my wings 
[01:08:00]  he'd come to my house  for dinner and stuff  and  oh wow  and it's not even that  even if  even  let's even say  comedy central said no  he could call  and say  hey look man  yep  i want you on the show  but i can't  you know what i mean  so and  you know  it's just  all the shit  you wrote  so how'd it go yesterday  when you saw him  it was so uncomfortable  like hey  what are you doing  so he knows  i'm going to take a piss  well i saw him in l.a when i go  what the fuck  i'm not doing  you know  what did he say  oh he did ask  on the first season 
[01:08:30]  and what did he say  he goes oh yeah  i'm pushing for you  or whatever  you know what  go fuck yourself  every time you needed something  that's a fake answer  wow  you call  you know  even if i wasn't writing  i had to read this fucking bullshit  you know  how do you like this  or how do you like that  or  you know  and norton too  norton gets that kind of stuff  because he knows how to do a roast  comics don't normally attack each other like this  i'm not attacking them  i'm not  do you think that he wasn't pushing for you though  because he does like you a lot  and he does think you're really funny  so why wouldn't he  maybe he did push for you  i don't 
[01:09:00]  then why wouldn't you call me and say  he probably thought you weren't right for a show  what  for the burn  yeah  how am i not right for the  that's what i'm saying  of course  that's why it's crazy  i'm on your side  oh okay  i don't think he was pushing for you  you do or don't  well  well he  you know what it is  it's his show  he could have said look  i really  we're gonna fucking figure out how to get him on  listen  he put ralphie on  and ralphie's a draw in clubs  don't get me wrong  he's a big act in club  ralphie sells out theaters  i like ralphie  okay  yeah  he sells out theaters  he's a good friend  nice guy  but it's not like 
[01:09:30]  uh  ralphie may  i like him  yeah  he's uh  he's big  you know  he's a  he's  very  but  it's not like he's a tv star  i mean i can see when you're going with a leading man on tv or jeselnik who have shows on comedy central  i could see that  you know  fucking norton has  you know  a resume as long as  i got nothing  i was on jeff's show once  i was happy to do it  but  no  you have a great resume  are your feelings hurt rich 
[01:10:00]  no  yeah  you're on jeselnik  yeah  yeah  probably  yeah  yeah  because  fair enough  the thing is  yeah  it's not  it's like  you know what  just a call  you called me many times when you had fucking roast  hey  hey  how about this  how about  you never called me tony  tony  you never called me  get off the bridge  you're right  you're right  i probably wouldn't even have done this show  shut up  you would have  no  i wouldn't  i got jet blow miles  it's okay  i know what you mean  rich is right  your feelings get hurt  it happens  it does 
[01:10:30]  fuck yeah  people you know  that's all right  i try to help out my friends as much as i can  that's what i do  that's what i do  that's what i do now  you try to help out your friends  that's all  i know  that seems to be a big thing in comedy  and if it doesn't happen  there's a fucking wrath  hell to pay  i'll say you know what  some people  you know  it's just all about them  right  you know  they  you know  they fucking  you guys  you guys have comics in here all the time  all the time  because you can't do 20 hours  all the time  having comics in 
[01:11:00]  it's like  i got to a point  where i was like  i said fuck comedians  i was so disgusted with comics  for a while  because so many of them  like i very rarely ask for anything  and then when you ask for one little thing  there was sometimes the response you get from people  even if they can't do something  it's okay  but the lack of response once in a while  i'm like just fuck these cunts  fuck them  why help comedians 
[01:11:30]  i know that they're good for the show  yeah  but like i'm not gonna say  don't have comics on  but there was a while  where i'm like  i'm not gonna push for any comedians  i'm not gonna protect them  when they can  fuck it  you just get to that point  where you're just like  you know  yeah  people are just disloyal  hey the second you call me  about that thing  that you didn't do  uh  right away i said yes  you know  that's what we do  when we ask norton  to do our sizzle reel  he fucking you know  i mean it's not like  he's got anything else happening  i was available 
[01:12:00]  and i said yes  before you gave me the date  you said are you available  i went yes  i don't know how that show  was not fucking picked up  because i'm telling you  everything i touch  dies bro  that's not true  it dies on the vine  it's not true  there's 10,000 working cocks  in this city  it doesn't die  it  whatever  i'm you know  i'm i'm peripositive lately  yeah  good for you 
[01:12:30]  not at all  fucking  she was talking about hiv  i just wish his name was perry  i like the idea of being perry boss  where are you gonna be at boss  oh god  saturday  i'm a hegan son  i'm doing a casino  at me  well friday's marissa's  but sunday  saturday at mohegan son  oh man  then the following weekend  at hartford funny bone  you know  mohegan son  go up there  play some golf  at those courses  oh yeah  did you watch the u.s open  yeah i did  watched a little bit of that 
[01:13:00]  that's a tough course man  holy  it's a shitty course  what do you  it's a shitty course  it's great when they don't  when they don't shoot  fucking 17 on the par  yeah i don't want 17 on the par  but when you're talking about a course  where not one pro golfer is under par for the tournament  that's a shitty course in the end  stop bragging about it  you don't think it's a tough course  it's a tough course  but it's a shitty course  oh  you hope he wasn't very happy with the course  no don't you think  i don't know 
[01:13:30]  one golfer should be under par for the for the tournament  well the first year  or it gets ridiculous  the first year at beth page  at the open tiger shot one under  and he was the only one  well you know  he was out  he was at one under  it's gonna bore people  but the u.s open  they're known for picking really tough courses  and making the conditions ridiculous  what was the one out in the hamptons  shinnecock or whatever it's called  i went out for that  i went out for that tournament  i watched  i watched the par three hole for two hours 
[01:14:00]  it was an uphill  they were  i don't know  they might have been hitting five irons  four irons  probably five irons  not one fucking guy  could get the ball on the green  every single shot rolled off the green  giving them really tough fucking chips  it was impossible  my point  it was impossible  they made it impossible  where you could not land it on the green  that's when it starts getting  what's that  that's when it starts getting ridiculous  welcome to golf tour  i know 
[01:14:30]  what about phil mickelson real fast  and we'll move on  no no  the guy this weekend that won  the travelers  44 year old  has never won a tournament  the travelers  because no one played that tournament  the travelers  a lot of them played  a few did  the winner from the open played  you know  it was like 10 major  major things  it came down to a playoff  it came down to a playoff  and a 44 year old guy won  who's never won  and there's no better feeling  than seeing the underdog  what about mickelson choking again  who cares 
[01:15:00]  he's overrated  they just needed somebody  to compete with tiger  back in the day  so they go  do you think he's a choke  mickelson  he's won three masters  but i mean  he won three  yeah  he won three masters  it's pretty rough though  he just can't figure out  that u.s open  he comes in second  that's the sixth time  i think right  yeah  that's brutal  how about vj singh  oh he's done  he's pretty much ready  for the senior tour  wow  he's gonna move on  what about the shark  oh my god  greg norman

[01:18:00]  in the editing room  why would you give them  five hours  we learned the hard way  with that stupid ass  bill o'reilly  we gave him  we gave him so much shit  and then  they edited the fuck out  and made us look like  just fucking  sex fiends  well  the thing is  because the tattoo  that fucking  sex fiends  remember  we had some  intelligent conversation  going on that day  sex  that all went on  the editing floor  well but the thing is  the tattoo  they had an agenda  took four to five hours  so I'm not gonna sit there  like a mind  that you gotta talk 
[01:18:30]  no don't say anything  and then just  give them a couple  really good lines  and then that's what  they're gonna use  well Bonnie says  some great stuff  and I think they used  one line I used  that was pretty good  but you know  thanks for the call  and thanks for watching  hey  Rich where's your tattoo  that they covered up  right here  what was it again  it was a tribal piece  yeah now it's just a  it's flowered  it's gotta get  touched up again  a little  what are they gonna  recolor it  yeah  yeah I mean  cause it's  it's a bit blotchy  it was a cover up  over a cover up  oh boy 
[01:19:00]  you know  I said this  this tattoo  it pretty much  sounds like the  Obama administration  I said there's  more cover ups  than Benghazi  that was one of the  jokes I did  on the tattoo show  that's a little  political for our show  yeah yeah  we're not very happy  with the  too political  this is a good  fucking  this is good  I mean  I know he said  Benghazi like it was  a guy named Ben  Benghazi  uh  oof  that tattoo show  they've played like  20 fucking times  I get more people  come up to me  from a tattoo show  than some  you know  I see it on twitter  all the time

[01:21:30]  then they  put a period  at the end  of it  and you  should never  put a period  at the end  of a tattoo  and you  should never  have a tattoo  to start  off with KK  because if  that's all  you see  you think  he's in  the fucking  clan  you think  all of a  sudden  he got  saved  after the  second K  like a black  guy walked  by who Joe  was like  he's a nice  fella  forget this idea  don't put that  there  KK  trucking  it is  it does look  like kitten  huh  I see kitten  every time  every time  my dumb  brain  looks like  it's

[01:30:00]  back to our show  the O.P. Anthony Show  we're lucky to have  Rich Voss in studio today 
[01:30:30]  I'll tell you that much  believe me  good thing you turned  the mics on  I had such a bad  fucking evil joke  to say about that  we were just talking  about the money  that Obama is  going to use  to go to Africa  100 million bucks  yeah  what happened  he saved  you know  90 million  and went to Detroit  yeah  he didn't  he didn't spend  100 million  to go there  yeah  the cost is  100 million bucks  for him and his family  to go to Africa  it was 100 million  it might be less 
[01:31:00]  it might be 60 million  70 million  and they're trying  and they're trying  to say that  it's business  you know  that it's a business  thing and it's not  just a vacation  it's taking the whole  family  they got safaris  planned  or they cancelled  the safari  but they're still  doing other  like things  but he gets up there  and says  we all need to make  sacrifices  we'll follow your lead  yeah  they're furloughing  federal employees  maybe you should go  you know what  I would have spent  60 or 70 million  going to Africa  but you know  I'm asking the  American families  to sacrifice  so we're going to  sacrifice this year 
[01:31:30]  and not do that  we're going to go  to Disney World  they say it improves  relations  it's bullshit  he should only go to  Camp David  they already have that  it's free  you've got a fucking  vacation place  right  I read that when  they went on the  safari last time  they have to hire  like marksmen  yeah just in case  lions come after  yeah but Mark's a good  guy and the people  he provides are worth it  oh fuck  oh Jim Chip  but wait Camp David  I mean they go up to  what Nantucket  or whatever  Cape Cod  they do that one  Kitty  Kennebunkport 
[01:32:00]  that was the book  Kitty  that was the original  bush  yeah but they  they always go up  to the vineyard  yeah yeah  they do  the vineyard  you know  which  it couldn't be  any more waspy  right  anywhere on this planet  you know what I mean  I hear you  so first of all  if he wasn't president  they probably look  you know what I mean  you know what I'm saying  well it's a lot of money  to spend to go on  a fucking vacation  the president  and they shouldn't  in these difficult times  be spending all that money 
[01:32:30]  I agree  and yeah  oh well  of course he decided  to stay  then it's worth every penny  I mean really  you don't like him  I'm not a big fan  of his policies  and what not  when are you going to  speak out about it  nice enough guy  it's about time  to speak out about it  I think  I think I  I think I have  what policy  are you  what policy  oh no Rich  please  oh Rich  it's everything  Rich  it's all of his  social policies  that cost money 
[01:33:00]  and do nothing  it's this  immigration reform  it's everything  that I just  I have no fucking use for  that just is  pretty much destroying  the country  I think it's  there's a lot more  he could be doing  with the money  this economy  doesn't seem to be  really getting  much better  the job situation  that he promised  you know  he in his first term  he used the  oh the last president  screwed everything up  well he could use that  this term also 
[01:33:30]  the last president  screwed it up  is there a democrat  that you would like  as president  like if it  you know what  I gotta be honest with you  in hindsight  I think Clinton  wasn't that bad  I mean obviously  some huge fucking problems  but he did seem  to know about business  and that whole  it's the economy  stupid thing  you know  he kind of knew  what it took  to make  to build the economy  you know  and 
[01:34:00]  a lot of this  these social  programs  and these  these bullshit  fixes  that the Obama  administration  wants to  put in play  I don't think  they help  and I don't like  his stance  on gun control  the second  his fucking  second term  kicked in  you know  he left  gun control  alone  and then  they caught him  talking about  how  oh in the second  term  that's when  things are going  to kick in  with the gun  control  and everyone  oh you're  paranoid  you're paranoid  well fucking  days into his 
[01:34:30]  inauguration  for a second  term  he's  he's  fucking  ripping guns  away from  law-abiding  citizens  enough  oh Larry  King's here  oh  look at Larry  better turn this  off  Larry  come on in  sir  come on in  Larry  come on in  Larry  Larry  pull up  your seat  over here  so good  to see  Larry  where's the  energy today  Larry  he's full of  energy  Larry  I gotta make  an observation  really fast 
[01:35:00]  give me more  earphone  more earphone  I think you  gotta do that  over there  you got the  volume under  the console  do we have  coffee here  is there any  connection  get Larry  some coffee  for the love  of god  how do you  take your  coffee sir  I take my  coffee with  three  three sugars  three equal  or any  of those  milk  not cream  right  you gotta go  whole milk  you gotta go  milk  Larry  I got an  observation  this is  I think  your fourth  time on our  show  we feel 
[01:35:30]  like it's  so  and I  will not  curse  I'll say  it's really  effed up  that you are  the king  of interviews  and now we  get to ask  you questions  it is amazing  we're just  two lousy  guys  I'm honored  that you  would say  that  I appreciate  it very much  we bow  to you  kings  presidents  dignitaries  you've spoken  to them all  and now you're  on our show  it's an honor  to have you  in here  Mr. King  well the truth  of it is  no the truth  it really is  you know  this may  sound like  baloney  but the  pant leg 
[01:36:00]  goes on  one leg  at a time  whether you're  president  or Heather  Mills  or Heather  I took her  leg off  on TV  did you  did you  really  I sure  did  see that's  I go to  the moment  wow  and she  was describing  her wooden  leg  and I said  can I  do it  and she  put it  up  and took  it off  wow  well you see  because  good broadcast  you two guys  know that  you take  risks  yes we do  yeah yeah  you got it  the only difference  between the ordinary  and the really good 
[01:36:30]  is the really good  are not afraid  hmm you know  you do have to  the ordinary  your risks  so therefore  the ordinary  are they think  like this  can I say that  there used to be  a sign  in the first radio  station I ever  worked at  and it said  if in doubt  no blacks  if in doubt  leave it out  right  oh  I broke that rule  wow  so I didn't have  I trusted my  broadcast 
[01:37:00]  instincts  yeah yeah  with that said  because even  in our radio  careers  we've seen  so much  change  what did  you do  way back  then  that was  like  unheard  of  where you  finally  broke the  rule  I was myself  right  if I was  funny  I was funny  I was a good  interviewer  I was curious  I knew  sense of pace  I loved radio  and when I got  into television  soon after  I loved  I loved  communicating  and that  came through  to people  right  they knew  that what  I'm doing  right this  minute  I love 
[01:37:30]  not like  yeah  love  and I think  every good  performer  or broadcaster  loves  no matter  what the  style can  change  but you  got to  love it  you got to  take it  seriously  and I  to me  I love  this business  I think  it's the  greatest way  not to  work  right  and for  example  you guys  are not  working  now  no  no  the last  time  the last  time  the last  time I  worked  was an  assistant  on a  United 
[01:38:00]  Postal Service  truck  before I  broke into  radio  United  Postal Service  used to  deliver for  all the  department  stores in  Manhattan  and I  was on  a delivery  truck  I was  a help  I didn't  drive  unless  we carried  up television  sets  for Macy's  did you  have to  crank  the front  of the  truck  what year  were you  cranked  the front  of the  truck  no but  I had to  wear my  brown  uniform  and all  of us  had to  look in  the mirror  every day  and our  hats  had to  be  wow 
[01:38:30]  oh really  yeah  they were  very strict  about the  uniform  we didn't  have  airplanes  then  we  just  had  trucks  what year  was that  that  did you  ask  56  oh wow  okay  and I  broke into  radio  and 57  in Miami  and you  and you  were friends  and we  were reading  something about  you  you knew  Gandolfini  and you  were with  him at  some event  I knew  James  I had interviewed  him a couple  times and I  was at the  Muhammad Ali  dinner  which all the  boxing champions  came to  and he and I 
[01:39:00]  were at the  same table  sitting next  to each other  and he was a  big boxing fan  and we  talked about  many things  a new show  he was going  to do  on HBO  how very  happy he was  he had this  little baby  girl  and he had  a new  life  and we  talked also  about the  strange things  that happened  to him  it was a  very interesting  conversation  that hasn't  happened to  many character  actors  the only one  we could think  of was  Carol O'Connor 
[01:39:30]  who's a  character actor  who's been in  many movies  plays  who you'd see  on the street  and you didn't  know the name  but I know  that guy  yeah I've seen  him and him  and then you  become a star  what's it like  to be  a working  character actor  and then become  a star  and having to  deal with that  because you never  went in it for  stardom  you didn't go in  to be the lead  and you like  you're comfortable  as a character actor  because you can go  into many roles  and you like the  idea of many roles 
[01:40:00]  you like being  a different guy  today and you  are tomorrow  and now you get  to be a starring  role so you're  Tony Soprano  and the world  sees you as  Tony Soprano  so nobody's  coming over  to give you  the character  actor parts anymore  yeah yeah yeah  you're happy  when you leave it  and then you go  back and you do  things like you  know he did  that great play  right you don't  think character  actors at some  point though  they aspire to  be stars  I think a lot  some don't  really  I just interviewed  Jane Lynch  yesterday she had  no desire to be 
[01:40:30]  a star  really  yeah she loved  doing what she  was doing  she's pretty  famous though  right  oh yeah  oh my god  extremely famous  and you really  believe that  when they tell  you they have  no desire  to be famous  well you know  take Gandolfini  what he said  to me  now look at me  I'm an overweight  Italian guy  from New Jersey  I know how to  act  am I a leading  man  but Tony Soprano  made him a leading  man  you wouldn't have  bet on that  right  there's so many  things that  come about 
[01:41:00]  that you would  have never bet on  I was talking  about this the  other day  if 20 years  ago I tell  you  we're gonna  have a black  president  and gays  can get  married  come on  what world  are you living  in  right  exactly  yep  Supreme Court  ruled today yet  did anybody  ever intimidated  it's a little  early yeah  what were they  ruling on  gay marriage  Proposition 8  California  oh right  Defensive Marriage  Act  were you ever  intimidated by  an interview  like to 
[01:41:30]  somebody  the only time  it was momentarily  was the first  30 seconds  was Sinatra  wow  because Jackie  Gleason had got  Sinatra for me  right  it's a great story  well Larry  I gotta fill you in  you did tell it  last time  I know  it's a great story  okay  I didn't hear it  I wasn't here last time  yes you did  I apologize for him  Larry  you're yelling at  Larry King  what's going on  with you  he can yell at me  he's helping me  are you Wopie 
[01:42:00]  yes  I want to tell you  something  sometimes it pays  to listen to your elders  Anthony is your elders  he said elders  I like that  now what Anthony  was doing there  was helping me  I was protecting  what he was saying  to me  don't embarrass yourself  you've told the story  before  and then you're  going to seem  like you're redundant  he asked me  were you ever  intimidated  so I said yes  the first time  I interviewed Sinatra  and then I thought  of the story  but I had forgotten  that I had told it here 
[01:42:30]  yes  you tell a lot  helpful Anthony  I tried to be helpful  I want to hear  a Jackie Clayson story  you're missing  the important thing  is that he's going to  stand up and say  what does redundant mean  sorry Rich  you know what  anyway  I would say  I would say that  the first time  first time  in the White House  doing an interview  in the White House  was a little  in the White House  yeah wow  that's got to  what president  was that  one in the White House  was 
[01:43:00]  I interviewed  Reagan and Nixon  after the White House  in the White House  was Bush 41  oh okay  and Barbara Bush  who became a very good  friend of mine  came over to me  and said  suspenders in the White House  oh wow  and I said  that's my gag  that's my gab  that's what I wear  how many presidents  did you interview  seven  it's seven  which seven  you gotta go  well go  Nixon  Reagan  Bush  Clinton  Carter  Bush too  and Obama  never Ford  oh and Ford 
[01:43:30]  who was the most charming  Clinton  Clinton  by far right  yeah  you could hate  Bill Clinton  yeah  despise his politics  think he has no character  and I'll put you in a room  with him for five minutes  you'll love him  he also was a great president  yeah  he knew how to balance  his life  he overcame great things  and he's regarded now  as a president  people miss  yeah yeah  he did wind up 
[01:44:00]  you know  everyone thought that  scandal  his little sex scandal  there was going to ruin  his legacy  but it just goes to show  how good of a job  he did as president  yeah  that he overcame that  in as far as history goes  I point at the TV  because Larry King  was just on  I'm on that guy  George  he might want to change  his name for showbiz  don't you think Larry  I'm on Friday night  with him on CNN  he doesn't work for CNN  he's got a package show  and there's like  eight shows run 
[01:44:30]  he is very good  he's a star from Canada  I think  big star  I was on his show  first in Canada  years ago  he's a wonderful interviewer  he understands  he's at ease  he has good questions  it's a very relaxed format  I don't know if CNN  is kind of looking at him  for something  but he's very big in Canada  have you ever  when you interviewed  like a president  or something  and you said  they're all such  charismatic  powerful speakers  have you ever kind of  had an uncomfortable  moment with one  where you  wanted to make  a political point 
[01:45:00]  or where there was  kind of a push and pull  between you  and one of those guys  I never had a problem  with presidents  presidents are easy  because they've made it  to the top  and they don't  it's kind of funny  they're in a position  where they don't need you  you know  you need them  they don't need you  and I've always had  a good time  some of it  you know  Clinton was  Clinton was very good  Carter was very bright  Reagan was very human  I remember talking  to Reagan about 
[01:45:30]  well I always try  to ask human questions  I was just  I always felt  that I was  on the kind of interview  even now on the internet  every day  on Hulu  I ask questions  that the public  would ask  I'm just  a man of the people  they call  New Yorker  the story  I mean  they call it  street talk  so  Reagan  I asked  what was it like  to be shot  a lot of people  would want to know  that  yeah  sure  but some might say  well can I ask  him  and then you know  he said  I didn't know  I was shot  that's amazing  because I heard 
[01:46:00]  a kind of sound  and the secret  service guy  pushed me so hard  that I thought  the pain was  from the push  the pain was  from the bullet  yeah  yeah  I just saw  recently saw  a documentary  on that whole  shooting  and it was  an amazing  story  the bullet  actually hit  the door  of the limo  flattened out  and then entered  his side  in such a little  slit pattern  it wasn't a bullet  and that's why  they had such a  problem  even realizing 
[01:46:30]  he was shot  and finding it  because it ended  up like a little  coin slot  yeah  went right in him  that way  not too far  from the heart  right  yeah  very dangerous  I was taken  to that same  emergency room  the Ronald Reagan  room when I had  my heart attack  really  yeah  they took me  into that same  room  wow  and that  that emergency  room is named  after Nancy Reagan  now  oh it is  yeah  George Washington  hospital  when did you  have a heart  attack  oh what a story  1987  I was a smoker  a three pack a day 
[01:47:00]  smoker  and I stopped  smoking that day  but  cigarettes could be  the worst thing  that anyone can do  to themselves  three pack a day  I was an idiot  but I liked it  and I was smoking  anyway I finished  the television show  and the guest was  C. Everett Coop  oh god  the surgeon general  I swear to god  and he says to me  you don't look good  I said what do you mean  he said I don't like  the way  you're still smoking  I said Jesus  wow  you got a great pallor  you go to see a doctor  and what did you go  what does he know 
[01:47:30]  I said no  I appreciate that  you know I had to go  do the radio show  I'm doing both  so I'm doing my CNN show  now I go do the radio show  and David Halberstam  the late David Halberstam  wonderful writer  I finish with him  and he says  are you feeling okay  wow  I said what do you mean  he said you don't look good  so I go back home  and I was doing the all night show  it's like 5 in the morning  and I started to get this pain  not in the chest  but in the right shoulder  oh boy  and the pain is going  down the right shoulder  it was terrible pain 
[01:48:00]  so I called out my doctor  and he said  that could be gallbladder  because gallbladder  has refracting pain  and the pain can go  to the arm  he says  go for the emergency room  by this time  it was like 7 in the morning  so  I called my producer  and he came and got me  and we drove over  to George Washington University Hospital  where Reagan was taken  and  as we're pulling in  the pain goes away  actually  and I'm smoking  smoking  oh my god  the pain goes away  so I said 
[01:48:30]  let's pull out  and we'll leave  I'm fine  oh my god  oh you were right there  and what happens is  a cop says to her  you gotta move the car  so she said to me  the producer  why don't you go in  just go in  and I'll pull around  so I said  okay  I don't have to go in  I'm not in pain  so I go in  and there's a lot of people  in the emergency room  it's snowing  February morning  and this guy comes  oh big guy  you know what I mean  he says  are you okay  now that's the third  are you okay  wow  he says  I don't like the way you look 
[01:49:00]  and what they have  is spotters  in the emergency room  so you don't have to wait online  almost like a triage  it could be  it could be a guy  with a broken arm  another guy  with a heart attack  so  they took me right  into this room  where Reagan was taken  and they started doing tests  and this  this cardiologist came down  and he said  I don't like the way you look  I know you've had the pain  you're not having it now  I think it might be serious  I'm gonna ask you to do something  don't leave  I'll stay here with you 
[01:49:30]  because I think that pain's coming back  when it comes back  we're gonna do  take some blood tests  so they hooked me up  ready to take blood  and he said  it's gonna come back  we sat there  we talked about sports  for about a half hour  and suddenly  whack  here come the pain  and the pain goes back  and it's going right down  my right arm  and they  they take these blood tests  and then they go across the room  and they're looking at the results  up on a chart  and I'm sitting there  and my producer's  standing next to me  and suddenly  a blue light goes off  wow  and they all turn around  the doctors 
[01:50:00]  the nurses  and they come running  toward me  and it's funny  how humor works  I leaned over  the producer  and said  I don't think  this is a pulled muscle  and the doctor  came right over  and said  and you never forget  that moment  Mr. King  you're having a heart attack  Jesus  and I said  am I gonna live  and he said  good question  he said  that's why they pay you  the big bucks  to ask good questions  that's what he said  we don't know 
[01:50:30]  the next 24 hours  is telling  the lucky part is  it's a right side  heart attack  generally 50%  of those  recover  so we're gonna  keep you here naturally  and do your tests  and we're gonna  give you this IPA  a special injection  that'll stop the pain  and I was in the hospital  with a heart attack  and I subsequently  went home  and  after how much time  did you go home?  about a week  stopped smoking  that day  threw cigarettes  I had cigarettes  in my pocket  threw them in the Potomac 
[01:51:00]  and then  six months later  I go in for a stress test  and the doctor  made me step off  the machine  in one minute  and said  there's something  really wrong  wow  they did a test  and he said  you're gonna need  bypass surgery  bypass surgery  so I'm scared of that  and actually  I said I want  a second opinion  so we called  a friend in New York  and the doctor  there said  you need it  so I decided  to do it in New York  because I wanted  to die in New York  wow  I was born and raised  I was very pessimistic 
[01:51:30]  I was born and raised  in New York  I was having the pain  I stopped smoking  but I was still having this  it was bitchy  man it was terrible  so I go to New York  so now it turns funny  it's funny now  by the way  it wasn't funny  right at the time  no  it's a rainy  November morning  end of November  rainy morning  1987  November  30th  my brother takes me  we get to New York  hospital  walk in  and standing right there  is Governor Mario Cuomo  and the president 
[01:52:00]  of New York hospital  and they said  Mr. King  you don't have to  fill out the forms  we'll take you right up  to the 15th floor  we have a special room  for you  and your surgery is tomorrow  so I was scared  that I go up in this room  and they show me this room  what a room  inlaid carpeting  a view of the East River  it's raining  I'm looking down  the East River  beautiful television sets  you know  chest of drawers  the only thing that told you  that it was a hospital room  was a hospital bed  other than that  everything was like a suite  and the president 
[01:52:30]  of New York hospital  says to me  Mr. King  I'll have you know  that the Shah of Iran  stayed in this room  and I said  as I recollect  he died  how about  you put me in a ward  with 48 people  all of whom go home  so it was  you know  now  I have not met  this  it's funnier  it's not funny  in the telling  not funny at the time 
[01:53:00]  I understand  now I have not met  my surgeon  he comes in the door  it's raining  Sunday  my agent  is sitting  Bob Wolf  the late Bob Wolf  my brother  comes in  he's got a 10 gallon hat  big cowboy boots  Dr. Wayne Isom  he wound up doing  Letterman  a lot of famous  Walter Cronkite  wonderful man  became friends  but at that time  I didn't know him  and he goes  Mr. King  you're going to do 
[01:53:30]  right fine  right fine  I looked at the films  it should be a breeze  you're going to do  right fine  I discovered that way  that all heart surgeons  are either from Texas  or Jewish  there's no  South Dakota  Republican  heart surgeon  and he comes over to me  and he starts to do  the thing that they all do  they take the two fingers  and they tap the chest  which I discover  is the first thing  they learn in medical school  tapping  and as I look down  I swear to God  he has no right thumb 
[01:54:00]  and he's doing the surgery  he's doing my surgery  he's got no right thumb  it turned out  there was a shearing accident  his mother was doing leaves  and cut it  and made him ambidextrous  this is I just have to lay it  but now  I'm looking down  I'm scared to death  he's telling me  what they're going to do  they're going to cut out  my chest with a saw  pull it apart  move my heart  put my heart on  a heart  a lung machine  and heart lung machine  I'm listening to all this  and he's got 
[01:54:30]  so here's what I said  and this humor  can come from anywhere  I said doctor  I have had this strange habit  all my life  when I meet people  for some reason  I count their fingers  with you  I get to nine  so he explained to me  the shearing axe  and everything  and I swear to God  I go to sleep that night  and I dream  that he's shaving  and he cut his other thumb  now he's got eight fingers 
[01:55:00]  and he says to the nurse  how many are we doing today  and she says five  who's first  king  and he says  oh we'll try king  and then I was  but it came through  and I had all my pellets  in me  they put inside  and that was 1987  and this is 2013  so  26 years right  26 years  and I had  I needed a stent  10 years later  a pre-stent  but you eat probably  pretty healthy  I try to eat healthy  I don't exercise as much 
[01:55:30]  as I used to  I walk a lot  I'm 79  I don't feel 79  I'm doing stuff  I'm on the internet  I'm doing a Hulu show  yeah  I can't believe  I'm doing all  I'm doing speeches  everywhere  I do a comedy tour  because I couldn't retire  no no  I noticed CNN  is starting to  use you a lot more too  again  yeah when people die  I've seen down there  a lot lately  what?  what?  what do I didn't hear you  on CNN  when people die  I interviewed them  and they have all these tapes  they do yeah 
[01:56:00]  they're standing by  called me yesterday  they said that Mandela  was critical  and  would I come over  and I would go over  and do it  and  so they have all that  and then I'm on this show  George  by Monopolopoulos  it almost sounds like  Stephanopoulos  Stephanopoulos  it sounds like Stephanopoulos  oh it's not him?  no no  they make fun of the fact  that his name is  he's from Canada  oh I thought it was  it's on on Friday night  he really is a rock star  in Canada  yeah it's a very good hour  can I ask you about Obama  what do you think of the job  he's doing?  mixed  mixed 
[01:56:30]  I like him  he's one of the smartest  not his background  one is  mixed  mixed  okay  right  sorry Larry  so Anthony got famous  yeah  he's a very very interesting man  I'm reading a book about him  and his relationship with the Supreme Court  I  he's awfully smart  he's not a touchy feely guy  he's calm in his own skin  very self confident 
[01:57:00]  a brilliant campaigner  oh yeah  his  the campaign he ran  the first time  and the second time  were genius  you know they were never in doubt  really never  no never in doubt  I've talked to the people  who work with them  they had it down  all around the country  even when the polls were  they missed the internet  didn't matter  the bad first debate  they contacted  about  a million people a day  wow  got calls every day 
[01:57:30]  wow  in key areas  in Ohio  and Arizona  they were in trouble  and they made personal contacts  he had recordings going out  and  it was just the genius  they knew how to use  modern technology  and they did it very well  and then he got the aid  because he was aided  by the Latino vote  which the Republicans  look like they're thrown away  right  and  and women  single women  are a big voting bloc today  what do you think about  the relationship  with the Supreme Court though  like with Kagan  he put Kagan in  and she was  and she wasn't even a judge 
[01:58:00]  right  she was  well she'd been  but she's very smart  she is  you don't have to be a judge  you know you don't have to be a lawyer  to be on the Supreme Court  I know that  you don't have to be a lawyer  could we be on the Supreme Court  Mr. King  I'm very fair  you know  just  just for the humor of it  I'd like to see  and now  and now it's decision day  and Mr. Opie will read  for the  for the majority  I like it  the vote is 4 to 4  and 1  I don't get it  here's Opie reading 
[01:58:30]  Opie reading the opinion  on Prop 8  the gay marriage prop  in California  I say let the kids get married  look they want to get married  let them get married  I would just say  let them get married  why do I care  why do I have to deal with all this  you want it  that's my reading  exactly  so go good luck to you  and I also  like an every man  I'm a huge fan of Larry King  and I loved the  loved the Monsignor  and you always did great  with the pop culture stuff 
[01:59:00]  what do you think of  Nick Walenda  and the Grand Canyon  I was on  yesterday  I was on The View  and he was on after me  he's coming in today too  yeah  is he going to walk  they won't let him  walk the two buildings  you know in New York  they're not going to let him  do that  Chrysler to the Empire State  yeah  that's what he wanted  do you remember  when Philippe Petit did it  back in 1974  I'm going to say  early 70s  the trade centers  then there was another guy  who climbed the buildings  oh that was George Willig  yeah but he had  a mountain climber equipment  no we're talking about  Philippe Petit  you know all these  little insignificance 
[01:59:30]  I love those  stunty things  that happen in New York  I knew the Walendas  the father's dead now  I guess  Carl right  Carl  do you know him  I remember him long ago  I wonder  and I knew  of course  I knew  the crazy guy  who jumped  Grand Canyon  in a motorcycle  Evil was a fun guy  I liked Evil  he had a beautiful sister  by the way  what do you think  of all the 10 second  delays now  Evil would jump  and there would be  no delay  we just saw him fall  and now they have to  put a delay on everything  but I always want 
[02:00:00]  guys like the Walendas  this is so Jewish  of me  there's not one Jewish  there's not one Jewish  Tyrell Walker  no Jew  no Jewish  Tyrell Walker  you could be a grave fighter  you could be an Israeli fighter  they could go in  with a man hunting  10 machine gun nests  but there's not a Jew  who would walk  from the Chrysler building  what the hell  are you  not even on the ground  are you nuts  are you nuts  that's crazy  I'm trying to know  what they get out of it  what do you think 
[02:00:30]  that Walenda gets out of it  a lot of money  I'm sure he made  a couple mil  who pays him  it's kind of selfish  to his family  don't you think  he's got three little kids  on the other side  and a wife  who pays for this  and what do the payer  get out of it  I would assume  Discovery gave him  a nice paycheck  you know  it's good for his brand  watching somebody  beat and do  what we would never do  is what we get out of it  I know what we get out of it  but at him  it's the same feeling  you get when you  conquer something  probably it's addicting  like you know  every time you do  a big interview 
[02:01:00]  I mean I'm sure  you want the net  you don't want to  just start interviewing  nobodies after that  like it's the high  of accomplishment  I understand the high  it's just  dangerous highs  I don't understand  yeah I'm not like that either  oh it's an adrenaline  junkie probably  it's thrill seekers  yeah  who was the crew  that you would like  hang around with  at the end of the night  like say you know  like your friends  oh the guys I grew up with  wasn't entertainers  no  guys I grew up with  I've gotten friendly  very friendly with  Al Pacino 
[02:01:30]  who lives a couple  blocks from me  in LA  politicians I've gotten  real friendly with  Mario Cuomo  pretty friendly with Clinton  Bush the first  I keep in touch with him  but I'm talking about  friends  friends are  three guys I grew up with  in Brooklyn  and Bensonhurst  they're still my friends  and to them  I'm Larry Zeiger  they have no airs  about them  they're all good guys  still bust your balls 
[02:02:00]  like friends do  yeah and they do  and they kid around  a lot  and they're also  protective of me  when people come down  the street  but I  I never left my  I left Brooklyn  but Brooklyn  never left me  you know  I'm still a Brooklyn guy  so when I come back  to New York  I live in Beverly Hills  I got a beautiful house  I got a beautiful wife  two young boys  Larry bragging  well you know  what I say  I walk down the street  with the wife  and people see me  and they see her 
[02:02:30]  you know  and there's a big age difference  sure  and she's really pretty  yes  and they look at me  and they look at her  and they look at me  and they look at her  and I know  what they're thinking  so I always say  the same thing  if she dies  she dies  get another girl  life goes on  two young boys  that did it without Viagra  I got a 14  and a 13 year old  and that keeps me young  yeah  I go to  their baseball games  and I help coach 
[02:03:00]  the teams  and my 14 year old  is going to Notre Dame  high school now  which has four kids  in the major leagues  he's very into baseball  is he good  he's very good  he's very good  middle infielder  she's a Derek Jeter type  really  you know  he hits the ball square  knows fielding  knows the game  so he's got real skills  skills  his younger brother  may be a better  all around athlete  football  tennis  soccer  baseball  jump off walls  but they're  so different  you guys have kids  I got two  I have three of them  are they different 
[02:03:30]  huh  well the black one  I got two in college  and one in kindergarten  first grade  I got 23  20  21  and a five year old  well I got 13  14  44  51  and 58  that's amazing  you got a 58 year old  oh wow  I adopted him  yeah  I adopted him  when he was 10  wow  yeah well I'm 79  you could have a 58 year old  sure  yeah but you look a lot  younger than 79  you know what I take 
[02:04:00]  that helps me keep young  it's banned in baseball  HGH  oh really  human growth hormone  is that good  I take it in pill form  players have taken  an injection  it's supposed to keep you  younger and you  quick recovery from injury  I've been taking it  for 16 years  it's not banned  in life  it's banned in baseball  what are the downsides  to it though  I have had no reaction  to it  so I don't know  what it does  except people tell me  I don't look my age  I take a lot of vitamins  Larry stands up  he's got a tail  I take medication 
[02:04:30]  you take HGH  how do you get that  you buy it from  you can get it in  G&C  G&C  yeah yeah  I'm going to start  taking that  I will too  man right  if that isn't  an endorsement  oh my god  just walking around  he used to  what was the big one  Larry what about  Garlick  Garlick it was  that's right  Garlick as in unique  as in Garlick  that was your big  sponsorship  that was the spot  are they still around  boy we did good business  certainly  you became synonymous 
[02:05:00]  with Garlick  and we might have  made fun of it  over the years  everybody  I also did  Welch's  grapefuse  Welch's  Welch's  grapefuse  Florida  orange juice  wow yeah  Garlick  unique as in Garlick  and now I'm doing  a vitamin commercial  now for  fish oil  yeah yeah  that's a big one  that is good  that's the best supplement  only supplement  that the FDA  approved  I have it  and I don't take it 
[02:05:30]  why  I don't know  he's not going to  eat his relatives  he's implying  that I'm fish  looking  that's why  he's in the corner  he's just mean  spirited  that's just terrible  there's Opie and Anthony  and that guy  that's Rich Vaughn  exactly  I'm a comedian  he's the world's  tallest dwarf  he just stops in  he's a local comic  it's the first time  he's on our show  first time on our show  we don't know much about him  what a surrender  he said he could sit in  from the Wizard of Oz 
[02:06:00]  it's a shirt  my kid bought it  and you  well I'm  that's a little hurtful  Larry I'm here  every time you come in  here's the problem  you do look like a fish  they never identify you  they never introduce you  that is terrible  I know  I'm Jim Norton  it's Jim Norton  and what are you  to the Opie and Anthony show  I am the anchor  the thing that stops you 
[02:06:30]  from going to Superstar  I'm just kind of  the third guy  in the room  and it's just a little  something I've been doing  for 11 years  by the way  a couple of questions  because I'm very curious  oh no  are you paid?  yes  now the next question  is it what they're paid?  no  is this a radio show?  I guess  some would say  why is there a beautiful lady  at the camera?  that's Sam  they film it  and maybe they'll throw  like five minutes 
[02:07:00]  up on the website  yeah they put it on the website  you know a little highlight  a little highlight  so I understand that  now explain  the guy in the corner  that's a  exactly  we've been trying  to figure that out  for a while  who's that?  buana of the jungle  what is he?  he says he doesn't have  any black in him  an ass  which confuses us  he's got kind of  black features  what do you do?  well usually I sit over there  when there's a guest in  I video them  but when you don't  when there's no 
[02:07:30]  when you don't  when you sit over there  what do you do?  nothing  nothing  he's supposed to be  our web guy  so and  and kind of  a very immediate  producer  how big is this production?  one two three  oh it's crazy  six every day  yeah  there's people  in the other room  that's one person  yeah  do you play music?  no  no music  not at all  do you always have guests  or do you sometimes  just jabber?  a lot of times  we have guests  but we like it too  when there's no guests  so we could just  kind of  talk about  so I'm not up  early in the morning  days of events 
[02:08:00]  do you talk news?  yes  yes  so like are you talking  about Supreme Court decisions?  no  yeah yeah  the uh  not so much  voting rights  I disagree with that  you disagree with that one?  you think it sets  a bad precedent  sets voting rights  back a few years?  Judge Roberts  began by saying  America is not the same  as it was  40 years ago  this is true  therefore he should  definitely vote  to throw out  Proposition 8 today  let's hope so  if it's not as it was  40 years ago  well that's true 
[02:08:30]  I like how they  call it  marriage protection  also  like anytime  they get to vote  or anything  it's always  something that  they're giving you  and protecting this  it's not taking away  something  that act  I think they'll  throw out  because I think  a lot of  national  what do they call it  the marriage  defensive marriage  act  that's gone  when you're talking  about gun control  legislation  it's usually presented  as some type of  safety  like we're going  to make you safer  meanwhile it's  you ever read  the second amendment  they're talking  about an army 
[02:09:00]  it reads  in order to form  a perfect militia  the right of the people  of their arms  shall not be  taken  Larry  I understand  why did they write  militia  you know why  let me explain why  and it is simple  if you read it  it was written  very simply  it's  to form  a militia  you need  the public  to be armed  so that if a militia  is necessary  to defend  your country  or your segment  of the country  that you live in  you need to be able  to get a militia  together 
[02:09:30]  a well organized  militia  very quickly  so in order  it's called the army  no but the army  the air force  but the army and air force  is the state  that is the state  the people  need the right  to bear arms  but the people are the state  well that's what  they intended  and if that ever changes  where the state  is against the people  alright for people  to have guns  I think it's absolutely  alright for people  to have guns  I think it's a second  amendment right  that is very important  to this country  very important  to our democracy  I don't agree at all  well I have to disagree  with you on that 
[02:10:00]  wait wait  let's get Larry's  take on it though  okay I interviewed  the head of Scotland Yard  once  and he said  I know him  he could not  it was beyond  his sense of  belief  that Americans  carry pistols  he just  he couldn't  I never saw a man  like this  he could not  he said  you mean  that any American  go into a store  and he understood  hunting rifles  he understood  seasons for hunting  and times of the year  when you can hunt  and rules about hunting 
[02:10:30]  but you can go in  and have a gun  and then he said  well what are the statistics  how many  yesterday  how many robbers  or people breaking  into homes  were shot  yesterday in America  by people defending  their home  my guess  none  maybe one  you think  what are the statistics  on guns  killing family members  high  what are the statistics 
[02:11:00]  on guns  with alcohol use  very high  are most  people who are killed  by guns  are people killing  people they know  yes  why do you want  guns  it is  the right  to protect  yourself  I believe  what are the instances  where you need it  where you need  well you know what  I haven't gotten  a flat tire  in quite a while  but I kind of like  having a spare  in my car 
[02:11:30]  I don't think  because nothing  has happened  doesn't mean  it might  you have children  I don't have children  no  but people with children  there's a good chance  that one child  will shoot another  there's not a good chance  Larry  let's be real  there's not a good chance  there's a better chance  of that than you  shooting a burglar  well there's a better chance  because the odds  that a burglar  coming in  is a lot  smaller than  you having kids around  but if you're a responsible  gun owner  that's the thing  any type of  powerful instrument 
[02:12:00]  whether it's a car  or a gun  or a machine  that you work on  at the job  you have to be responsible  there is an element  of responsibility  with gun ownership  that has to be adhered to  when you have  a constitutional right  yes  you don't have  that responsibility  in other words  no no  rights come with  great responsibility  you should know that  just from the first amendment  it doesn't say that  in the law  no no wait a minute  hold it  when you have a right  that's inherent  you have a right  to have a gun  that's what you're saying  it says  right yes  don't say you have  to be responsible  I just have a right 
[02:12:30]  no but responsibility  an automobile  is not a right  right  so I have the right  to test you  license you  right  because it's not  a god given right  sure  but I can't stop you  from free speech  no but even with  free speech  there is an element  of responsibility  that goes along  with that  but if you're  irresponsible  what can happen  to you  with the first amendment  you could be  you could be arrested  the typical  fire in a theater  only if a panic 
[02:13:00]  inciting riots  only if a panic  occurs  well true  but also in these days  there are people  that are losing  their jobs  based on what they say  there are consequences  that go along  with every right  and the abuse  of those rights  we're never going to  come to a good  no we're not  I think the gun society  is insane  I think America  is insane  I think the media  takes it  and really does  blow it  way out of proportion  shoot up 24 children  let's not cover it  no no  I would never  downplay that Larry 
[02:13:30]  I'm not saying  that that isn't  a huge tragedy  what I'm saying  is there is  a portion  of the media  that loves  to throw  that out there  like it's commonplace  and the truth  of the matter  is it's  it's not commonplace  and a lot  of these gun crimes  especially these days  and gun violence  is a culture  it is not  a mechanical thing  it is not  a gun  a machine  that is doing  the killing  it is a cultural  problem in this country  with gang violence 
[02:14:00]  there's  what if they  didn't have guns  they have guns  Larry  look at prohibition  look at prohibition  honestly  what if they  didn't have guns  if they didn't  have guns  there would be  other ways  that they would  kill each other  not as efficiently  but they would  still be killing  each other  you used the word  efficiently  I would feel  better  if nobody  had guns  I feel better  myself  protecting myself  with a gun  I enjoy  being able  to have a gun  responsibly 
[02:14:30]  have it on me  or have it  locked away  you're not  a tea partier  who believes  the police  will come  and take your guns  no  I don't believe  the police  are going to  come and take  my guns  but through  very sneaky  legislation  I do believe  that these  restrictions  will keep  piling up  until it becomes  virtually impossible  to get guns  or ammunition  they have  infringed  on a right  that it says  shall not be  infringed upon  I read the amendment 
[02:15:00]  differently  but  that's what makes  the world go around  it certainly does  Mr. King  they're telling us  we have to  I must just tell you  something  honestly  I am honored  to sit here  and debate  with you  for a little bit  it's a healthy debate  the second amendment  should be debated  it should be  you know  the founding fathers  were not  they were okay  they weren't geniuses  no of course  and that there's  there's things  they could not  have known about  I mean look at  how the world  exactly  has  can you go to 
[02:15:30]  Thomas Jefferson  and explain to him  satellites  no but you could  explain Sam's hair  and he'd get it  related to Thomas Jefferson  some family overlaps  between the  house  so that's what  you're saying is  Larry  if Thomas Jefferson  walked in this room  the only person  he would grovel to  is Sam  Sam's in his bloodline  for real  yeah  Thomas Jefferson  and we're thinking  it's from the side  of the family  that they tried  to keep quiet  for a while  but it came out 
[02:16:00]  yeah that's real  the best thing  ever said  about Jefferson  was said  by John Kennedy  when he  he hosted  a dinner  of Nobel Prize winners  in the blue room  at the White House  it's a great line  and he said  this  is the greatest  collection of minds  ever to dine  in this room  except when  Jefferson ate alone  that's a good one  so you have  great bloodlines  so what are you doing  standing in a corner  running with a little mic  you think Jefferson  would be doing it  no  he's going to have 
[02:16:30]  to start somewhere  he'll be a Shonda  yes  he's an up and coming  broadcaster  he's more like  the Sherman Hemsley  Jefferson  Jefferson made it  with slaves though  that's exactly  the hair we're thinking  yeah we're trying  to figure it out  his founding father  Ben Franklin  he was a cut up  Ben Franklin  was quite a ladies man  going over to France  and tearing it up  over there  very international  man of mystery  that guy  did not know  how many children  he had  yeah  you got to read  something  yeah I wanted  to give you a plug 
[02:17:00]  and then I had  one question  that's your stuff  Larry yeah  I wanted to just  give you a plug  about when your  show was on  hi I'm Larry King  and I'm promoting  my web series  Larry King Now  it's on Hulu.com  every day  it's a one-on-one  web series  it focuses on guests  we have newsmakers  celebrities  world leaders  I was recently  with James Gandolfini  at the Muhammad Ali  event in Vegas  my guests on my show  have recently included  Seth MacFarlane  Betty White  Oliver Stone  Kevin Nielsen  Kevin Nealon

[02:19:30]  to see it  on television  and try to  put yourself  in that position  what  you can't even  say what  were you thinking  what  what's the best  way you can  explain what  that is like  being in the  middle of that  I'll explain it  the way my  great grandfather  did  life is on  the wire  everything else  is just waiting  and you know  that's something  that I've done  since I was  two years old  so for me  it's life  it's what I do  for you  you don't  understand it  for me  I don't  understand you  sitting in the  studio here 
[02:20:00]  on the radio  neither do our  listeners  so when you  step out there  you have  complete faith  in yourself  in your  training  yeah in the  fact that I  prepared properly  you know I  have a training  camp in Sarasota  Florida  my hometown  where I  train with  wind speeds  of 91 miles  per hour  leading up  to this  I've actually  trained last  year at  120 mile  an hour  winds  for this  event  we also  created  gusts  45 to  55 miles 
[02:20:30]  per hour  which is  great  because I  experienced  Cantore told  me 48 mile  an hour  winds while I  was down on  the wire  we had two  gusts near  that  or one  or one that  was at  48  we saw  your clothing  really  rippling in  the wind  like that  everybody  the biggest  question about  that walk  was what  type of  jeans are  you wearing  yes  people did  notice the  kind of  flared bottom  they were  worrisome  I felt like  you were  going to  catch your  heel on  your jeans  you know  what's funny  why wouldn't  you wear  flood pants  I wear  buffalo jeans 
[02:21:00]  and I just  love them  they're extremely  comfortable  and it  really is  all about  people being  able to  relate to  me  I don't wear  rhinestones  and sequins  and tights  I want people  to go hey  that guy's  a normal guy  that just has  a very unique  occupation  I got a  beautiful wife  three beautiful  kids  and I just  do something  that you guys  can't relate to  and that's why  13 million people  here in the US  alone tuned in  to watch  with that said  some have said  it's a little  selfish to  walk the wire  with the kids  and the wife  on the other  side freaking  out  well a couple 
[02:21:30]  things to that  for one  my wife  and kids  my wife  comes from  eight generations  of circus  on one side  seven on the other  she performs  on the wire  right alongside  of me  so she's just  as darn  selfish as me  and my three  kids were raised  around it  it's all they  know  it's what  their dad  does  so I'm sure  there's a little  bit of stress  but it's nowhere  near the stress  level if you  were to go  on the wire  and your kids  were to watch  tomorrow  this is just  what their dad  does  I'll give you  an example  I walked  across the  Allegheny River  in Pittsburgh  about three  years ago  and I was about 
[02:22:00]  250 feet up  it was  1400 feet  across  it started  raining while  I was walking  and as I was  walking  there was a  bridge to my  right  and I look  over and my  family's walking  alongside  and both my  boys are down  playing their  Nintendos  and I was told  during this event  my kids were  texting most of  the time  I think that  speaks volumes  to how comfortable  they are  I have one more  question  that I just  need to know  what's your  plan if all  of a sudden  you realize  oh boy  I'm going to  fall  what's the move 
[02:22:30]  you do  because obviously  you've figured  that out as well  absolutely  the wire  is always at my  feet  whether I'm  1500 feet  over the Grand  Canyon  or 1500 feet  over the streets  of New York  City  that wire  is always  right at my  feet  there's a  misconception  that because  I'm higher  it's more  dangerous  the truth is  I've trained  my entire life  since I was  two years old  that if I ever  get off that  cable  even step off  to get a  drink of water  I grab that  cable  now gravity  pulls you down  we all know  that  we also do  plenty of  studies  four years  of meteorological  studies  that show 
[02:23:00]  that the winds  aren't strong  enough there  to pick me up  and throw me  off that wire  it would take  more than  hurricane force  winds  we knew  that there was  going to be  nothing maximum  of 60 miles  per hour  so therefore  I would have  fallen down  and if there  were any gusts  if it were  to get too gusty  I would have  went down  to that wire  I would have  dropped down  I probably  would have  had no more  kids  but I have  three  and I'm  happy with  that  anyways  I would have  dropped down  and bear hugged  that wire  I trained to  hold onto that  wire between  20 and 30 minutes  my rescue teams  who are standing  by on each side  have baskets  that are mounted  to that wire  as well as  a helicopter  standing by  all trained 
[02:23:30]  to be at me  within 60 seconds  no matter where  I am on that wire  so there are  backup plans  there's contingency  plans and it's  a lot safer  than maybe you  can understand  but the truth  is that wire  is at my feet  now the next  78 was walking  between two  buildings in  Puerto Rico  he fell and  lost his life  well if you  watch that video  which I've  watched hundreds  of times  he goes down  to that wire  which is our  safe haven  he was 73  he had a double  hernia and an  injured collarbone  and had no  business being  on the wire 
[02:24:00]  now that's with  the deepest of  respect because  he's my hero  but he didn't  have the strength  to hold on  and if you don't  have the strength  to hold on  anymore  you might think  you're fine  walking  but you shouldn't  be on the wire  anymore  is that what it  was he just  couldn't hold it  and that's why  he couldn't hold it  that's correct  and it did  also look like  the pole  well the pole  helped him go  down a bit too  it absolutely did  see he went to  sit on the wire  I sat actually  in Sarasota  during my training  camp we had  30,000 people  from my hometown  show up during  training  and I would sit 
[02:24:30]  on the wire  20 feet up  I'd sit there  for half an hour  doing question  and answer  with the public  we're extremely  comfortable in  those conditions  and I think  it was evident  even that night  on TV on Sunday  and how do you  ditch the pole  if you're falling  the pole  actually would  just get tossed  out of the way  and again  it's stuff  that we train  for  we train  to drop  to that wire  and grab  on  this is just  incredibly  fascinating  to us  and then  I have to  say this  when you did  the Niagara Falls  walk  we were all  so mad  because I know 
[02:25:00]  it was your TV  partner  and you were  a good sport  about it  but it was  obvious  in the end  I think  that was a  huge gift  because it  made this  event so much  bigger  it really  did  and here  he's doing  it without  any protection  seven times  higher  much stronger  winds  more than  double the  amount of  winds  wouldn't your  move be to  go back to  Niagara Falls  now without  the safety  wire  we'll see  I don't know  I would think  about it  I think it's  almost stepping  backwards though  to do that  I've got my  sights set  on other  things  New York  has always 
[02:25:30]  said no  to the  skyscraper  I haven't  even knocked  on any  doors yet  so yes  if I was  the chief  of police  and a camera  was thrown  in my face  and somebody  said  would you let  Nick  do this  he said  what he's  trained to do  and I respect  him deeply  but we go  through the  proper channels  and actually  I'd start  with the  governor's  office  and you  have a  great  relation  with him  I had to  change  the law  over 100  years old  just to walk  over Niagara  and if I can  change a law  I think I can  make things  happen  with the  assistance  of others  were you ever  scared over  the Grand  Canyon 
[02:26:00]  I wasn't  ever scared  no there was  never a point  where I thought  I'm going to  fall or I'm  going to have  to go grab  this wire  there were  two points  where you  saw me  kneel down  and that was  because I  started to  build a rhythm  in that cable  there's no  stabilization  and no  shock absorbers  in that cable  those pendulums  you saw are  simply to keep  that wire  from twisting  out from  under my feet  they don't  take any  of that rhythm  out  because what  will happen  is if I  keep the  same pace  and the  same size  steps  I'll build  a huge rhythm  in that cable  a frequency  that'll keep  getting bigger  and what happens  is it bounces  to one side  comes right  back at me  so I had to  stop  let that fade 
[02:26:30]  out a bit  and then get  up and keep  walking  what do you  look at  when you're  walking  what is your  focal point  it just depends  as I walk  over the edge  that's the  biggest rush  I can only  imagine  you love that  feeling  absolutely  look down  and enjoy that  and then  there were  three points  on that wire  where I was  able to look  down  and actually  enjoy the  view  I had to  be very  focused  we had an  issue  with the  tension  of the  cable  the engineers  had expected  the weather  and the meteorologist  told us  the weather  was going to be  about 97 degrees  that night  it was only  about 86 degrees 
[02:27:00]  and the cable  gets more  taut  more tension  when it's hot  outside  so as it  cools off  that cable  starts to  release tension  we were  supposed to  be at 67,000  pounds  and we were  only at 62  so that wire  moved a lot  more than it  was supposed  to  it seemed  to have  some slack  in the  middle  they showed  one point  where the  camera was  looking right  down the  cable  and you  could see  the sag  in it  you're walking  uphill  when you're  halfway through  and actually  it's much  more comfortable  to walk  uphill  than downhill  I started  on a plateau  that was about 
[02:27:30]  40 feet higher  than where I  finished  so three  quarters of  the walk  was downhill  which is  much more  uncomfortable  was there  ever a moment  on a wire  anywhere  where you  had a moment  of I can't  do this  or this  like I always  thought my  nightmare is to  wake up where  you are  and then look  down and go  oh I can't  do this  have you ever  had a moment  where you're like  there was never  a moment  there was a  couple moments  where I was  like it kind  of took me  back  and I always  relate to  or always talk  about the  first world  record I did  which was in 
[02:28:00]  Newark, New  Jersey  at the  Prudential  Center  when it  first opened  I did a  world record  where I  rode a bicycle  on a wire  live on the  today show  for a world  record of  135 feet  high  235 feet  long  and it had  that same  drop  it's called  the catenarian  engineering  terms  but it's  basically  a smiley  face  and of  course  riding downhill  was easy  but when I  got to the  three quarter  mark  I was riding  uphill and that  back wheel  started to  spin  and it was  kind of like  it took me  back  and you go  back to  training  and I've  trained to  get off  of that  bike  I can pick  that bike  up and walk  in and all 
[02:28:30]  of that stuff  comes into play  your mind  kind of works  a million miles  a second  but again  it's so much  about training  and preparation  what I do  is such a  calculated risk  people don't  understand that  because you  don't walk  a wire  but we  can train  for pretty  much everything  including  92  120 mile  hour winds  you can  prepare for  everything  that's what  makes it amazing  for the  spectator  because we  don't think  about all  the training  that is  involved  we just  see a guy  on a wire  and go  ah  what's he  doing  I say  it all  the time  if there 
[02:29:00]  was one  police  officer  or three  police  officers  in the  world  and 100,000  wire walkers  then everybody  would be  wow look at  the police  officer  that's unreal  I think  what he does  is way more  dangerous than  me  we'd still  be looking  at the  wire walker  the pre-show  was almost  more amazing  than the  Grand Canyon  walk  when you  went back  to where  your grandfather  fell  and you  redid it  and your mom  decided to do it  and then she  has to sit  down on the  wire and then  you have to  walk over her  it was  unbelievable  watching her  get back  is amazing  the strength 
[02:29:30]  involved  when I was  training in  Sarasota  with this  cable  my mom  had to  she was  begging me  please let me  get on this  cable  let me walk  it with you  so she  got in that  cable  and walked  with me  in training  and if I  let her  she would  have walked  across the  Grand Canyon  no question  and she  could do it  no problem  I think  she could  do it  I wouldn't  allow her  to  because I  would be  worried  about her  and she  would take  away  a little  you know  I mean  come on  let's  be honest  his 60  year old  mother  did it  too  exactly  what do  you think 
[02:30:00]  of the  production  technology  because if  you look  back at  the earlier  you know  Walenda family  obviously  just huge  seven generations  and the  camera work  in the old  days  the way  that looked  over Niagara  Falls  and the  Grand Canyon  spectacular  the Discovery  Channel  did an  unbelievable  job  we had  I think  16  cameras  including  two  on me  POV  cameras  and  you know  it was  unbelievable  I'm excited  because we're  working on a  director's cut  right now  we're all  talked through  that entire 
[02:30:30]  walk  the helicopter  shot  where it wraps  around you  and the  background is  flying past  you  your center  frame  and then  it takes  off  and now  goes away  and puts  you in the  distance  it was  you got  goosebumps  it looked  amazing  I haven't  even watched  the entire  thing  I'm waiting  to do that  film of the  director's cut  but I've seen  as I'm doing  the media tour  I've seen  some footage  and it gives  me goosebumps  it makes me  nervous  and I was  the one on  the wire  and the other  amazing shot 
[02:31:00]  was from the  floor  from the  bottom of  the canyon  up  and they  I've heard  I've seen  that one  they pull  back  slowly  and you're  like when  is this  going to  stop  because you  are literally  a dot  up there  the only  thing that  they didn't  do that I  really wish  they did  was put  I wanted  to put a  car down  in the  bottom of  the canyon  because I  wanted people  to have  something to  relate to  it's so  hard when  you're there  there's no  perspective  you just  can't understand  you can't  contemplate  those rocks  those rocks  down there  because there's  nothing to  relate it to  I would be  impressed  even if you 
[02:31:30]  wore a parachute  while you  did that  I would still  be blown away  by that  you said you  were having a  problem with  an optical  illusion  very much so  you know those  jagged edges  of the canyon  I'm looking at  a wire that's  moving I'm  looking at these  pendulums that  are moving  opposite of that  and those canyon  walls I mean it  was messing with me  like you wouldn't  believe it  I was trying to  figure out where's  the wire and where  am I because  normally there's  something that I  can focus on  and when you saw  when I got  three quarters  of the way  across I can  guarantee my  face changed  because now I  could focus on  the end point  above those 
[02:32:00]  walls and all  was well because  now I have  something solid to  focus on but  those walls give  that illusion with  that wire moving  like they're moving  as well so you  need something for  your equilibrium  you just gave me  anxiety just  I saw it in your  face too Jimmy  yeah it's it's  it's hard we  have this this  we kind of like  fully petite a lot  because we had  the train center  walk sure and  there's nothing  about what you  do that makes  sense to me  like it's so  terrifying and  it's that's why  people are so in  awe of it it's  like we can't  the balls the 
[02:32:30]  courage to do  that I mean you  obviously have a  lot of faith  oh absolutely I  think that's  important well it's  important in my  life you set a  world record saying  Jesus the most  yeah I think so  actually actually  Jesus was trending  on Twitter that  is that used for  yourself also  obviously it's your  faith and it  helps you is it  kind of a mantra  though I was I  was just raised  that way and  that's where I  find peace and  who else is  going to listen  to me while I'm  up there but  God I'm right up  there with him  how sweet that 
[02:33:00]  would you be if  you just heard  him go Nick I  heard you  there are there  are so many so  many photos on  the internet right  now of like you  know there's one  of Jesus under me  holding me saying  shh stop saying  that  you know there's  so many it's  hilarious  before you reach  the other side  you were an  internet meme  definitely you were  on there  1.3 million  tweets within  that two hour  special amazing  people in this  day and age just  love being involved  in something like  that it becomes  this huge community  of people as 
[02:33:30]  close as you  could be in the  same room watching  it is amazing  you know modern  technology social  media and the  fact that I can  I you know I  talk to my fans  all the time and  I think that's so  awesome that I'm  able to and it's  so inspiring to  me you should  have tweeted as  you were walking  I had my phone  in my pocket  I wanted to tweet  from the wire  I wanted to tweet  a photo from  there  it was just the  wire was moving  way too much  in the way  you were thinking  about it  oh absolutely  there has to be  a way to do it  one of my next  walks guarantee  there has to be a 
[02:34:00]  way to do it  where you can have  a button  well when I broke  that world record  in 2008 on the  today show I was  135 feet up I  sat down in the  middle of the wire  got my phone out  and called Matt  Lauer on my cell  phone so I can  tweet from up there  for sure and I  can almost guarantee  you my next walk  I'll be tweeting  from the wire  here's the problem  as we see it  you're running out  of walks because  I mean where do  you go after the  Grand Canyon  there's so many  around the world  there's the top  of the Eiffel Tower  the Great Wall of  China the pyramids  in Egypt there are  just many that I  want to do I want  to do the opera 
[02:34:30]  house in Australia  to the Harbor Bridge  it really doesn't  have to be the  highest or the  wide it's like just  the backdrop  the backdrop  that's what it's  about that's my  partner on TV and  that's what it you  know it's about that  amazing backdrop  and showcasing  yeah  would you do the  because of course  the Trade Center's  not here anymore  but what are the  towers the Petrosian  Petronas Towers  absolutely yeah in  Malaysia  what is your  because we're  obsessed with  what's his name  Alain Robert  or Alain Robert  the guy who  climbs the buildings  yep  but you to me 
[02:35:00]  are the only guy  that trumps him  what you do is  I think  yeah Petronas Towers  are definitely on the  list  how high are they  now  I don't know  1100 feet maybe  taller  no they're higher  than that  so what's your  number one  would they be your  number one  or what's the place  that you're like  I want your dream  walk  it's so hard  because there's so  many to be honest  I mean there really  are so many  I really want to do  something big here  in the city  I really do  that would be  amazing to watch  yeah  oh my god  how far is the  empire  sorry  how far is the  empire  it's about 
[02:35:30]  4000 feet  from when  now we're  working on  actually I have  my engineers  looking at it  this week  they've been out  in the canyon  4000 feet  that's what I  want to say  obviously you're  online and  tweeting and  what not  we've read  from some people  that are just  ridiculous  like  the wire's  as wide  as his foot  do you read  some of those  and you're like  really  what do I have  to do here  of course  there's always  people  you've got  haters too  to be honest  what is it going  to take to  not have haters  the bravest 
[02:36:00]  guy in the  country  to be honest  with you guys  it is extremely  uncomfortable  to walk on that  cable  because I've  trained my  entire life  to walk on  a 5 8 inch  wire rope  the size of  a nickel  my whole life  so it's like  changing it  all over again  you know  I've trained  for one thing  and that  I don't  physically have  a groove  in my foot  but I really  do  I know  where that  wire is  to set  on a  2 inch  wire rope  you don't  have that  so if you  step to the  side  it starts  to twist  that cable  starts to  do this  under you  and it's  very easy  to do that  so if 
[02:36:30]  anything  if it was  my desire  it would have  been a  5 8 inch  wire rope  why did  they make  it bigger  because of  engineering  we had to  there was  no way  to stabilize  that cable  if you  watch  like even  Philippe Petit's  walk that he did  here in the  trade centers  he had ropes  coming off  the sides  that would  stabilize  that wire  we couldn't  do that  no one  in the history  of wire walking  had ever  rigged a cable  until Niagara Falls  like what I  rigged  and it moves  a lot  it's got a  life of its  own  as I told  you about  those rhythms  those ropes  that we put  on normally  they help  stabilize  and take all  those rhythms  out  so you know 
[02:37:00]  it took a lot  of special  specific training  for this walk  the anchoring  process was  amazing to watch  too  drilling those  deep deep  holes  putting it in  cementing it  because you know  you just look  and you're figuring  now how  that's a lot  of weight  that cable  across quite a  span  how is that  fastened  we had to  tension that  cable to  you know  I think I said  earlier  but about  67,000 pounds  67,000 pounds  and everything we do  is redundant  and we work  in a 5 to 1  safety ratio 
[02:37:30]  which means  if that cable  can support  5 pounds  we'll never  put more  than 1 pound  on it  and if those  anchors can  support 5 pounds  we'll never  load them  more than 1 pound  so everything  has to be  5 times over  what we're doing  that's why  there were  4 cables  and you know  the engineers  do all of that  stuff  but that's why  I had to use  that big cable  going back to that  was because  the weight  of it itself  is about  8.5 pounds  a foot  that helps  stabilize the cable  if I used  a 5 8 it would  have snapped  under that load  for one  and number 2  it would have  been everywhere  all over the place  did you clean up  after yourself  there Nick  because they 
[02:38:00]  were very concerned  over there  at the Grand Canyon  absolutely  actually  they requested  that we leave  they wanted me  to even leave  the cable up  they didn't want  anything to move  because it's an  amazing attraction  for them  now they requested  that the day  after the cable  came down  because they  weren't out there  they were in  their offices  in Navajo  but they  did ask  we are leaving  all the anchors  and the start up  and finish platform  they've asked  to leave all that  stuff and they're  doing  I guess it's  going to be  we'll lend  a lookout point  where people  can actually  go out there  and see where  I started  and finished  if you left  that believe me  you don't want  to leave 
[02:38:30]  that cable  somebody would  get out  some drunk  well that's  exactly right  it would have  to be secured  very well  what part of  the canyon  was it  like I know  the South Rim  I've been to  the South Rim  the basic part  it was on  Navajo territory  and about  8 miles  outside of  the national parks  so in order  to get permission  from national parks  is like changing  a law  which is what  I had to do  in Niagara Falls  it's more than  that it's like  an act of God  really  but that's  what we did  on Navajo land  it was really  good for them  it really  promoted their  land  and we paid 
[02:39:00]  them a good  sum of money  to be there  as well  and you know  it was a great  experience for me  for sure  we just had  Larry King  and he said  what do you  get out of this  do you get  a good paycheck  from Discovery  I do  believe it or not  it's more about  the passion  and love  for what we do  but you know  Niagara Falls  I barely broke  even on  no kidding  wow  this one I did  pretty good on  though  after hitting  incredible ratings  after the first one  life gets a lot  easier in that sense  do you have any  phobias  I mean heights  are terrible 
[02:39:30]  I really don't  but you know  I respect heights  just like you  I've just learned  to control that  more than you  probably  but when I walk  to the edge  of the building  and look over  the edge  it's not as I go  arrogantly  like ah  you're a superman  no  I'm human  I bleed just like you  you know what I mean  I've got that same sense  it's built into all of us  you know  it's a conscience  but that's the rush  when you step over  the edge of a building  and you just  move down  and you realize  I'm over the edge  of the building  you love that  I do  but I've walked a wire  since I was two  I've walked on the ground  only a year longer  so it's  there are walks 
[02:40:00]  if that wire  if there was no wind  and that wire  was completely stabilized  in no arrogant way  because that's not me  but it's like walking  on the ground  honestly  it's no different  than walking on the ground  we discuss  every so often  we talk about  if you would take  a sidewalk  and run it  over the Grand Canyon  exactly where you were  you wouldn't get people  that would walk  that sidewalk  it's all a mind game  now meanwhile  you can walk a sidewalk  on the street  without even thinking about it  you're not going to fall off  even winds 
[02:40:30]  you walk in the street  all the time  with 45 mile air winds  you just don't realize  you think twice about it  even balancing on a curb  on that  when you're walking  on the street  but there's something  about that height  that adds this frightening element  what I do is more mental  than physical  no doubt about it  that would make sense  more mental  because yeah  you would never go out  even on a street  without rails on it  you'd be petrified  at the end of the broadcast  you went to the edge  what were you thinking  because they left you alone  it was a dream come true  I had a contract  with another network 
[02:41:00]  four years ago  to do this walk  the cable was already purchased  and the contract was signed  they ended up backing out  of the contract  not because of anything  other than financial problems  on the networks  you know  so to have that dream come true  was a big deal  it was quite emotional  that I'd made it across  there's so much work  that goes into this stuff  you know  the preparation  that goes into this stuff  is vast  people don't realize  how much energy  and effort  the amount of  even the amount of media  leading up to this  this was shown live  in over 170 countries  around the world 
[02:41:30]  on the Discovery Channel  big  I mean Olympic category  huge  so media from around the world  and it's draining  and to be able to say  I did it  I made it  at this point  it's hard for me  to even realize  because this is so long  in the making  this is something that  when I was a teenager  was the first time  that I thought of doing this  wow  and to be able to fulfill  that dream  and a dream  that no one in the world  has ever done before  similar to Niagara Falls  no one in the world  ever walked  there's myths  that wire walkers  walked over  the truth is  no one did  they were a mile downstream  Blondin did it  and others 
[02:42:00]  but to be able to do that  is just  it's mind-blowing to me  I'm living my dream  and it's dreams  that are not like  you know  making a million dollars  it's dreams  that are like impossible  or seemingly impossible  how many times a year  do you walk now?  it really depends  I'm actually working  on some stuff  here in the city  and hopefully  I'll be back  but for some  hopefully walking over  a couple ball games  very soon  oh wow  but working  again  working on that  right now  and many other  walks around the country  where I'm trying to walk 
[02:42:30]  between a couple  mountain peaks too  by the end of the year  and you don't take  any of them for granted  though  because the one  where you're like  oh that one's  kind of easy  I have to look past it  to get to the big one  you don't leave them  oh absolutely  every single one  my great grandfather  did some amazing walks  you know Tallulah Gorge  he was 700 feet up  and 1300 feet across  Vet Stadium  he did a bunch of  crazy walks  he lost his life  on a walk  that was 135 feet high  which is kind of minuscule  compared to the other walks  he's done and I've done  and it was 200 feet long  and he lost his life on that  we have to take  every single one 
[02:43:00]  I've got an uncle  who's paralyzed  two that died  from 30 feet  30 feet  yeah  really  so you better take  30 feet  you better take  at all serious  every single one  how did it happen  30 feet  were they in a circus  they were performing  yeah  an arena  in State Fair Coliseum  in Detroit, Michigan  and it was a  seven person pyramid  so there were seven  on the wire  at the same time  two were paralyzed  and one  I'm sorry  one was paralyzed  two actually were killed  but we went back  actually  that was in 1962  we went back  on that same exact wire 
[02:43:30]  in that same exact arena  for the same exact producer  and redid that walk  in 98  and that was when I knew  I was going to carry this on  believe it or not  I was accepted to go to college  and I was going to become  a pediatrician  my mom wrote a book  when I was younger  called The Last of the Wallendas  because financially  it was over  you couldn't pay your bills  and she thought it was it  and my parents pushed me  they did not want me  to have anything to do  with this industry  they said go to school  and I was accepted at college  my uncle gave me a call  and said hey  why don't you be a part of this  we're going to recreate  the seven person pyramid  we're going to show the world 
[02:44:00]  that we're still around  we're still strong  and Wallendas are still going  seven generations  and I said cool  I'll do it  and we trained for about  seven months  and I thought this will be it  I'm going to do this walk  and I'm done  I will go on to college  the last hurrah  the Wallendas  I was part of that  great  and I did that walk  I went there  and we did it actually  about 32 times  during two weeks  and I remember seeing  the media from around the world  and saying you know what  this is my calling  and it's not that  our industry is dying  it's just changing  and I'm going to do it  in a big way  from here out 
[02:44:30]  within three years  I had the world record  for the eight person pyramid  that I brought my family  over to Japan to do  when I was 22  and then since then  now I have I guess  I think this will be another one  but I think I'll have  eight world records  huge  how are you handling  the notoriety  because obviously  you're a recognizable guy  now  you know it's fun  in a lot of ways  it's a blessing  you know there's some  challenges too  when you're having dinner  and everybody's coming up  but that comes with it  that's just part of it  and I enjoy it  and you know again  I'm extremely blessed 
[02:45:00]  to be in the shoes  that I am  and it could be the other way  where I'm not paying my bills  and I have no notoriety  but really my dream  and always was  to put my family's name  back on the map  my great grandfather  did an amazing job of that  and it was about  making sure the whole world  knows who the Walendas are again  and again  I'm blessed  I'm living my dream  that pyramid  I saw that at the circus recently  I don't get it  because no one can fuck up  everyone's got to do their job  and you've got to  you've got to trust everybody  that's right  it's so much more dangerous  because it's one guy 
[02:45:30]  trusting six others  actually me and my wife  performs on the wire  I said that  and we have an agreement  that we will never perform  that pyramid together  like if she's on top  I'm not involved  and if I'm on the bottom  she's not on top  it's kind of like  flying separately  because of the kids right  yeah that's right  because of our kids  we'll never jeopardize  but you still do  the pyramid thing  oh yeah absolutely  is it really dangerous  it is  it is  you know I have a book  that just came out  June 4th  that I should talk about  called Balance  and it really tells my life story  and it talks about  the training leading up to that  and yeah  I mean it talks about  the challenges of 
[02:46:00]  and the amount of work  that goes in  people don't realize  I mean this is a lifetime  dedication to do what we do  we dedicate our lives to  and some of us in a sad way  have dedicated our lives to it  but I you know  I believe words are powerful  my great grandfather  always said  he didn't want to die  in a nursing home  he wanted to die performing  and he did  and I always say  I want to die in a nursing home  at an old age  because I don't want to die that way  and how many Walendas  are walking right now?  there's 15 of us  that are performing  15?  yeah  yeah  all over the world  when you ride the bike  and this might be a silly question 
[02:46:30]  are they regular bike tires  or do they kind of extend  like a tram?  no you know what it is  it's a specialized bicycle  you're a child  and it's a stock bicycle  I lock the front end  I take the handlebars off  so my balancing pole has room  and I take the wheel  the actual rubber off the wheels  the tires  but it's just the rims  are they real bike rims?  real bike rims  they're the stock rims  right off  you can order on their website  wow  really?  yeah  huh  you don't modify it at all  not the least fit 
[02:47:00]  huh  and the only difference  the only other thing  it's a fixed gear bike  which is stock again  you're a bigger dude  than I realized too  Nick is a  you're built like Fedor  he's built like a fighter Nick  like you know  it's hard to tell  on the clothes you wear  but sitting next to you  you have big arms  you have to be in a shape  I'm sure to do that  I do some elliptical  but I mean  it is important  to stay in shape  and people are surprised  at my size  because they expect  to be some small  dainty person  you know  doing what we do 
[02:47:30]  but  yeah yeah  we're not  what are we promoting  for Nick  they're telling us  to wrap  what are we promoting  for you  besides your book  other than my book  my book's come  it actually came out  June 4th  Balance  story of my life  alright  it's an amazing story  amazing family  and the last one  over the Grand Canyon  was just spectacular  to watch  stay tuned  because I promise  there's much more  to come  for New York  yeah please do  something in New York  if they let you  that would be just great  that would be fantastic  Nick over here  we'll tweet this shit  oh there you go  thanks so much 
[02:48:00]  thank you Nick  wait what's your  Twitter  what's that  Nick Walenda  just Nick Walenda  N-I-K  W-A-L-L-E-N-D-A  just we loved it  thank you so much guys  thanks for your support  thank you Nick  Nick Walenda  the O.P. and Anthony  Show  Sirius XM  and now  back to  the O.P. and Anthony  Show  on Sirius XM  really liked  Nick Walenda 
[02:48:30]  what a great guy  real nice guy  he was a good guest  he said he would  come back  yeah  we got an exclusive  we did?  yeah we know  what he's doing next  so  don't challenge me  he told me  he told you off the air  I know  Iraq you should have  played walk this way  when he came in  douchey  these boots are made  for walking  walking on sunshine  walking on sunshine  that's more like 
[02:49:00]  you know  cause up in the air  walking on sunshine  I'm walking  and here comes Nick  Walenda  and the other day  he was walking  on sunshine  the sad part  there's someone  down the hall  going yes  that's what  I've been trying  to have them do  wow now that's  a radio play  welcome  Nick Walenda  the guy of course  that just tight roped  across the Grand Canyon  Grand Canyon  and he was  walking on sunshine  that's right  wow  oh fuck 
[02:49:30]  he was cool  about the Jesus thing  we weren't gonna  we weren't gonna  push him too much  on that  I thought it was  gonna be a big  I thought he was  gonna be very  religious  like to do  an interview with  you ever see  people that have  to interview  very religious  people and  they're just  constantly bringing  up God  and stuff  no  and that's what  led me to believe  what Jimmy  has been saying  that it's kind  of a mantra  out there  right  like he  he says it  to relax himself  and  but it's not like  every second  of the day  he's  and for everyone  that has  haters on Twitter 
[02:50:00]  yeah  that was  that should speak  volumes to you  today  Nick Wallenda  who fucking  tightroped  across the Grand Canyon  had to deal with  shit on Twitter  are you kidding me  look how wide the cable is  that's nothing  you fucking tool  we get why we get  haters of course  but I mean  a guy like him  should not have  one hate tweet  that was amazing  fucking nothing  right  fucking people 
[02:50:30]  yeah  I wanted to just  a quick  quick little  update  because people  depend on me  for  Zimmerman trial  information  yesterday  there was  the first eyewitness  testified  a woman  what about a  JKLMNOP  or QR witness  we get it  and  it was  an eyewitness  for the  for the prosecution  she  she was  she was 
[02:51:00]  supposed to be  the witness  that the prosecution  said was going to  say that there was  a chase going on  she saw someone  running after someone  never said in her  statement that she  knew who was  running after who  but there was  some running  and then she saw  some kind of a  fracas going on  arms flailing  as she said  some of these  things  kind of  got in the way  of what Zimmerman's  initial statement was  blah blah blah  it's a black woman  and  that was the first  witness  well she gets up 
[02:51:30]  and then  during cross  examination  Zimmerman's lawyers  start questioning her  and  apparently they're like  you have a  Facebook page  she's like  yes I do  you  did you  Facebook  like  a  convict  George Zimmerman  Facebook page  oops  yeah  oops  she did  thank you  that's all he said  it was right at the  end of the thing 
[02:52:00]  yeah yeah  of other questioning  but that was the  final  like hey jury  by the way  catch this  so  you pretty much  took all of her  testimony  and throw it right  out the fucking  window  would George tell them  not to consider it  no they can consider it  but  you're told that  if  if you don't believe  part of someone's  testimony  you could pretty much  throw out all the  fucking testimony  and if you  you believe there's  bias  on someone's part  you can throw away  all their testimony  and the jury will be 
[02:52:30]  charged with all this  they'll be  they'll be given  instructions and  whatnot  and that's a very  important thing  is credibility  is everything  in a trial  with your witnesses  and  if she  liked  a  convict  George Zimmerman  page  you pretty much  got to believe  that her testimony  could be biased  so  that was one of  the big  prosecution witnesses  by the way  why wouldn't the  prosecution see that  and ask her  to unlike it  before the trial  yeah could you  unlike that  yeah  as a matter of fact  wipe out your 
[02:53:00]  fucking page  because  yeah that was  a huge one  and  from what I'm  seeing  every day  I'm really being  led to believe  more and more  that George Zimmerman  will be acquitted  of this  not even a  lower charge  or anything  I think  will absolutely  be acquitted  the prosecution  you weren't sure  going in right  I was positive  oh  the prosecution  remember also  the prosecutors  they don't want to be  forced into prosecuting  this  there was no arrest 
[02:53:30]  right off the bat  until there was  all this pressure  so they were pressured  into arresting him  and pressured into  prosecuting this case  and a prosecutor  doesn't want to be  forced into having  to prosecute  they should have  went to a grand jury  who would have  looked at the facts  and said  ah  alright  it's a self-defense  case  to now have to  prosecute it as  murdered too  is ridiculous  and these prosecutors  are put in a bad  position  where they have  nothing  they don't have  a case here  and they're having  to make something  of a case about this 
[02:54:00]  and they just  don't have it  the defense doesn't  even have to be  that good  that's what's  fucked up about this  oh he's telling  a joke at the beginning  oh he fumbled  this one  he didn't object  to this  that or the other  thing  well you know  what  that proves  how easy  a case  this is  they don't  even have  to be that  good  because  the prosecution  it's their  burden  to prove  and they  don't have  it  they just  don't have  it  so if the jury  is instructed  properly  and they  consider what  they're supposed  to consider  and keep all  that static  and peripheral 
[02:54:30]  bullshit  out of it  I do believe  you'll see an  acquittal  on George Zimmerman  I actually  got a question  oh yes sir  what's the  whitest city  in America  for when  the decision  comes down  the decision  comes down  what officially  is the whitest  city in America  I would think  somewhere in  Montana  Montana  I think you gotta  go to  Montana  it'll be very  white and I  could do some  fly fishing  you don't want  to go to  Indiana  no no no 
[02:55:00]  lots of black  people in Indiana  yeah  and as I said  yesterday  and I'll say it  today and I'll  probably say it  fucking tomorrow  the press  the mainstream  media  should be held  accountable  for any  violence  if there is  an acquittal  and there is  violence  because they  reported this  case right  from the  beginning  inaccurately  and with  so much bias  against George  Zimmerman  that people  that watch  the news  and all they  get as far 
[02:55:30]  as information  about this  is from the  news  you would be  led to believe  that he should  be convicted  now if he's  acquitted  that's the only  information these  people are going  to have  and wonder  why he was  acquitted  there will be  allegations of  racism  of all kinds  of inappropriate  actions on the  part of the jury  all that  will come into  play  when the truth  of the matter  is if you  paid attention  to the case  and know a  little bit  about  the laws  you would  know that 
[02:56:00]  he should  be acquitted  but you know  the news  has other  agendas  so good  luck to  everybody  godspeed  everyone  and in  other news  because it's  breaking as  we speak  they just  arrested the  patriots  guy  Hernandez  right  yeah  they just  took him  out of his  house in  handcuffs  yep  boy  that's it  career down  the shitter  right there  what it's  a friend of  his or  a friend of  a friend  murdered  a mile  from his  house  I heard it  from a 
[02:56:30]  friend  heard it  from a  friend  what the hell  do you think  happened there  I don't know  I could  one murder  at a time  I don't know  what is the  allegation there  I don't know  alligator  seems a little  shady  is it  yeah  the body was  found a mile  from his  house  you think  you would  take care  of that  shit  and I  oh that's  right I  did hear that  he has a  security system  in his  house  but everything  was destroyed  oh wow  all the  all the 
[02:57:00]  DVRs that  record the  cameras and  everything  just fucking  wiped out  wow  didn't he  smash his  phone or  something too  yeah yeah  his cell phone  oh my god  he's throwing  his life  did this guy  just throw  his life  away  yeah  yeah  fuck  that's crazy  they officially  arrested him  they just took  him out of  his house  in handcuffs  bye bye  within the  last  maybe not  even an  hour  he had a  cleaning crew  come in  the day  after  yes  oh  Jiminy 
[02:57:30]  Cricket  yeah they  got something  he's in  Dutch  yeah  well down  for obstruction  of justice  obviously  if you're  cleaning crews  and smashing  your  yeah at the  very least  you have  like  fucking  let me see  your phone  what  this phone  what's  this phone  wham  wham  I dropped  it  oh shit  wow  they can still  get information  off it  can't they  yeah  yeah for the  most part 
[02:58:00]  I had a  phone that  I had a  bike accident  last summer  I went flying  over my bicycle  and pretty much  snapped my phone  in half  it was bent  in half  and they got  everything off  and no problem  pictures of him  at a titty bar  with the deceased  the same night  yeah they were  all hanging out  that's what I'm  saying  wow  yeah  there's a  man that's  the nightmare  we talk about  like you  you go to sleep  you start dreaming  you dream that  you're involved  in a murder  you're trying to  cover it up  and you realize 
[02:58:30]  this no  I can't  this  you open your eyes  and then you wake up  and you're like  oh I'm out of trouble  it is one of the  greatest feelings ever  you're like wait  all that stuff  that I thought  oh it was a dream  oh my god  I'm in trouble  I'm so fucked  I'm in trouble  ah no trouble  oh I gotta go to work  oh that's great  I gotta go to work  I gotta get in the  shower  yeah by the way  I'm gonna drive to work  today but yeah  I was just in a whole  murder cover up  right  amazing  seconds ago  but he's feeling  like that now  and there's no  waking up  that's gotta suck 
[02:59:00]  yeah I mean  what a dummy  like you have  such a great life  sometimes I feel  like when you  look at like  people who fuck  up royally  like who went  to jail for  who just killed  what's the big  murder case  that's happening  right now  George Zimmerman  no no no  it's a domestic  case  uh  guy killed  his wife  or something  we just  we've just been  talking about it  anyone  pal talk  I'm asking for a  reason because  Jody Ariaris  no it was a guy  a guy  killed a chick 
[02:59:30]  yeah  the one that  shot through the  door  oh the  the leg  the no leg  guy  no I don't  remember  it might have  been him  or it was  Dr. Richard  Kimball  no  um  but I'm thinking  to myself  like  oh no I had  watched a documentary  on somebody  okay I'm sorry  it was a documentary  but I was  watching a guy  killed his wife  and I think he  killed his wife  and I'm like  as mad as I've  got at exes  I never did  anything stupid  like that  like sometimes  you realize 
[03:00:00]  like fuck man  even though  things are annoying  I have not  ruined my life  oh  like you know  what I mean  when you look at  people who  in one moment  whether it's  drunk driving  and killing  somebody  or shooting  somebody  or whatever  it is they've  done  they've ruined  their life  and like this  guy  it's like  you're one of  the patriots  you got a  great fucking  gig  that's terrible  there it is  and uh  if he did it  over and over  again  maybe he just  covered up  information too  that's true  he might not  be up for  murder here  maybe obstruction  he might be  yeah  yeah  he's definitely 
[03:00:30]  in fucking  trouble  that's for sure  you don't want  to be that  guy  no  we're wrapping  up  I want to  remind people  that today's  podcast day  every Wednesday  a brand new  Opie and Anthony  podcast  this week's  episode is  episode number  seven  make sure you  subscribe for  the podcast  because that  gives us those  fake numbers  that we love  and this  week it's  Max  Cook  the guy  who does  Tony Soprano  perfectly  he called  from the grave  as Tony Soprano  and a little 
[03:01:00]  twist he was  also on Ambien  because he was  so distraught  about the  death of  Gandolfini  so it was a  really strange  weird phone call  so we put that  up on the podcast  this week  also Tony Danza  from when he  used to do  his Tony Danza  show we used  to mess with  the people  online  yes we did  and also the  Dave Rabbit  tapes  this was a  listener request  and yeah  good idea  he's the guy  that used to  do radio  while he was  in Vietnam  and I've  had the tapes  since I went  to college  thanks to 
[03:01:30]  Stork  Fred  my friend  Fred gave me  these tapes  a long time ago  we thought the  Stork was  retarded  and we finally  did something  with it on the  radio show  and now it's  on the podcast  just really  interesting to  hear a guy  broadcasting  from Vietnam  and  they were great  tapes man  his voice was  great  I love those  things  the big 69  yeah I loved  them  talking about  the whores  and the drugs  and all sorts  of stuff  it had a sound  to it man  a really weird  older  there was something  about it that took  you into another 
[03:02:00]  era  yeah  it was different  than anything  you hear  I loved the  rabbit tapes  yeah absolutely  so you can hear  the tapes for  yourself and  our commentary  on that  on this week's  podcast  and what's the  opening Anthony  nugget  it's  wow  I don't even  know  I didn't  fucking pick  the nugget  we never  got into  this  I had to  argue with  Sal a little  bit  because he  wanted  another  E-Rock  song  oh god  what did  you want  Sam  we put on  Crazy Gary  Busey  Sam  I got with 
[03:02:30]  Coke Logic  I think he's  going to animate  that thing  oh yeah  yeah he's going  to animate  the Crazy Gary  Busey thing  I also think  Sal may have  just been  looking for  an excuse  to play  the E-Rock  songs a whole  bunch of  times in the  office  sitting next  to  we do  know he  loves that  loves to  push those  buttons  oh  loves pushing  a button  nice  I'm looking at  numbers  I want to  thank everyone  that's  subscribing to  the podcast  I'm looking at  really solid  numbers there  thank you 
[03:03:00]  and the links  are on our  Facebook page  and it's on  iTunes  and it's on  the SiriusXM  fucking site  somewhere  if you can  navigate that  shithole  SiriusXM.com  slash  Opie and  Anthony  that seems  pretty easy  yeah  it's right  there  oh  they're going  to allow  the past  911 calls  that Zimmerman  made  and an alternate  juror has been  dismissed  no reason  given by  the judge  Zimmerman  called the  police  close to  50 times  over an 
[03:03:30]  8 year  period  to report  such things  as  slow  vehicles  loitering  strangers  in the  neighborhood  and open  garages  this could  be a bad  thing for  the defense  I think  if it  shows this  pattern of  the same  things that  he's you  know doing  if every  suspicious  person is  black  I'm sure  the prosecution  is going to  try to paint  it as  he's a  racist  something like  that but  and this is  why the defense  was trying to 
[03:04:00]  keep these  other tapes  quiet but  again as  far as  static goes  as far as  letting the  jury work  with the  facts of  this case  you could  show some  prior intent  but I  don't think  it's going  to hurt  the case  is it  Jimmy Day  today's  Wednesday  Jimmy  is it  Jimmy Day  my advice  oh boy  you know  what I learned  from Jimmy's  advice show  there's a lot  of people  drinking and  taking drugs  out there  in this room  holy fuck 
[03:04:30]  yes  a lot  of fucking  people  in recovery  wanting to  be in  recovery  not in  recovery  at all  but fucking  amazing  Jimmy's got  a great  you got a  great rapport  with people  that need  help  especially in  that line  not so much  people dealing  with children  when they say  my kids are  doing this  Jimmy's like  I fucking  dump tape  them in  their room  and fuck  a whore  I can only  give  most times 
[03:05:00]  people on  advice shows  are speculating  and I think  you should be  honest when  you're speculating  you let the  people know  that you  do not  I'm not an  expert at  this  things like  addiction  though and  stuff  and getting  help  and people  that are  having a  hard time  with those  things  and relationships  also  albeit you  can't fucking  hold on to  one for a  minute  I literally  there's not  one hungry  woman in  New York  they're all  full  no coffee  no fucking  lunch  oh no I've  had my share  of coffee  and I've  had my lunch  would you like

[03:06:30]  downstairs  no upstairs  here at  Sirius  like the  elevator doors  open  he steps out  and I think  somebody right  there was like  Jerry  it's probably  Denny  nothing  oh hey  Jerry  who was it  I don't know  somebody said  I think Roland  knew this  pretty yeah  Roland  it's probably  Roland  and Jerry  didn't know  what he said  Jay  Jay  Jay  Jay  Jay  Jay  Jay  Jay  Jay  If you want 
[03:07:00]  to play some  words back  later we can  I'm going to  have some  not add  yogurt  think about  it  no I don't  want to  Jim Norton  next  Opie and  Anthony  have left  the building  but Jim  Norton  is not  going anywhere  if you have  problems  and a phone  it's your  lucky day  the Jim  Norton  show is  next  Jim 
[03:07:30]  Norton  is a  moderately  successful  comedian  an average  author  and a  terrible  actor  and your  chance to  speak  directly  with him  has arrived  call  866-969-1969  the phone  lines are  open  and the  Jim  Norton  show  starts  now  it's almost 
[03:08:00]  lonely being  in here  without the  great  Bailey J  Bailey and  I have been  chatting  I would like  to film  this  and so  I've been  chatting  with her  about that  she will  be here  within the  next couple  of weeks  so  she really  adds a lot  when she's  here  I love  doing the  show by  myself  and I'm  comfortable  doing it  by myself  I simply  enjoy her  as a  person  and I  enjoy her  advice  and I  think  she's  very  funny  and bright  so  I really  enjoy  when Bailey  is on  the show  with me  it's just  a fun  thing  to do  all right  but we 
[03:08:30]  have another  hour together  so let's  talk to  yay  Paul  yay  hi  Paul  hello  hello  hi Paul  how are you  you're on  the line  oh well  they got the  name wrong  what's your  name  Bill  Bill  well  I guess  the issue  I'm having  is I  found out  the girl  I'm seeing  for almost  two and a half  months is a  32 year old 
[03:09:00]  virgin  a two year old  virgin I hear  you  32 year old  virgin  yeah  she's not  religious but  like she's been  brought up to  like save  yourself for  marriage type  of thing  oh wow  did she suck  your dick  not yet  how long  are you dating  her  about two  and a half  two and a half  years  months  months  well you know  what dude  now do you  really like  this girl  I do  okay well  that's not a  problem I  mean but she  won't fuck you 
[03:09:30]  until you're  married  it looks that  way and it's  not something I  really believe in  you know  yeah I don't  blame you  so you might  have to dump  her to me  any chick  that's held  out and isn't  sucking dick  till they're  32 there's a  problem there  and I know  it's religion  or whatever  it is  it's not  normal to be  a virgin at  that age  or to at  least like  at least if  she should let  you eat her  ass or she  should blow  you but if  she's not  helping you  come then  what are you  what are you  gonna do  with her  for fucking  getting married  and then you  find out her  pussy's terrible  or she hates 
[03:10:00]  fucking  right exactly  so what is  your question  how should  you leave  her  well really  what I want  to know  is like  I don't want  to be the  dick that  pushes her  into having  sex  right  absolutely  it's your  I'm damned  if I do  damned if I  don't  I just don't  like  I'm not an  asshole  I don't like  being assholes  towards women  and how do I  well  push my agenda  without coming  off as an  asshole  I would suggest  being honest  I think the  best course of  action  because she  may be ready  to fuck 
[03:10:30]  dude  the best course  of action  you can take  I think  is to say  look  having sex  in a relationship  is important  to me  I don't think  I'm ready  for marriage  yet  but I want  to be very  honest with you  and say  she might go  well then  forget it  or she might  go  no I really  like you  too  and I'm  ready for  some dick  but let's  ease into it  so she might  be willing to  work with you  maybe she'll  jerk you off  a little  blow you  or maybe she'll  just lick  your balls  while you  jerk  I know you  think I'm  kidding  but I'm  not  maybe you  can bridge  her into 
[03:11:00]  sex  maybe she'll  try little  things  to help  you come  and then  eventually  be ready  for sex  but I think  if she's  not ready  for any  of that  and she's  like no  no none  of that  until I'm  married  then you  just gotta  fucking  ditch her  and I  don't think  you're being  a dick  I think  she's being  unreasonable  so tell her  to take her  fucking  Viking  16th century  thinking  and fucking  and hit  the yellow  brick road  sounds like  a plan  good luck  my friend  thank you  sir  god bless  alright  my friend  John  in New  Jersey  here  who  why do you 
[03:11:30]  can you hear me  Jim  yes  John  right  yes  okay  hi buddy  how you  doing  Jim  good  what's up  I'm  calm  because  I have  an issue  for about  the last  six months  me and my  girlfriend  have a very  healthy sex  life  but I find  in order  for me  to  get there  I've been  having to  think about  that  it's  almost  like an  unwilling  exchange  on her  part  a rape  fantasy  now you  think  you're  holding her  down  or whatever  yeah 
[03:12:00]  I mean  like  we do  do  some  bondage  play  and everything  like that  and we do  have like  rough sex  but in my  head  I imagine  that she's  enjoying it  even though  she doesn't  want to  right  so your  fantasies  are not  that you  rape is  about  power  and abuse  and harm  you're not  thinking that  way  you're thinking  more of  sexual dominance  yeah  well I don't  think there's  anything wrong  with that  I think a lot  of women  have those  rape fantasies  too  of course  they don't  I mean  even when  they want  to be degraded  or spanked  or even  smacked  hard 
[03:12:30]  it doesn't  mean that  they want  to truly  be raped  so I  don't  rape  fantasies  are I  think  different  than what  you're  having  you're  having  just  power  and  you  want  her  to get  sexual  pleasure  from your  power  type  stuff  I don't  think  that's  bad  have you  told her  no I  haven't  discussed  it  with her  I mean  she likes  to be  choked  she likes  to be  held  down  cool  she likes  the dominant  part of  it  sure  I feel  guilty  afterwards  that  that like  I'm  thinking  like  that  like  oh  she  doesn't  want  this  but  now  she's  enjoying  it  and  like  almost  like  it's  like  against  her  will  don't 
[03:13:00]  feel guilty  about your  fantasy  man  it's  harmless  you're  not  hurting  her  you're  enjoying  each  other  don't  feel  guilty  about  what  you're  fantasizing  about  you  should  the  true  psychopath  fucks  a girl  hurts  her  and then  fantasizes  that she's  enjoying  it  for real  you're  doing  you're  actually  just  making  it  up  in  your  head  with  a girl  who  really  is  enjoying  it  so  I  think  you're  okay  I  think  you  should  tell  her  though  maybe  you  can  play  act  it  that  would  be  great  yeah  okay 
[03:13:30]  yeah  she's  a very  open  girl  thanks  Jim  good  luck  my  friend  Matt  in  Canada  welcome  Matt  hey  how you  doing  good  how are  you  I'm  good  man  listen  I'm  three  years  sober  and  I've  thank  you  and  there's  actually  something  you said  on the  air  that got  me  on  stage  the  first  time  but  anyway  the  question  I  have  for  you  is  a lot  of  the  stuff  like  some  of  my  favorite  jokes  that I  thought 
[03:14:00]  of  are  sort  of  based  around  the  culture  of  the  anonymous  program  sure  sure  sure  yeah  and  I  was  just  wondering  how  you  would  feel  about  me  doing  you  know  public  material  about  something  that's  supposed  to  be  private  and  anonymous  well  you  know  I  was  three  years  sober  when  I  started  comedy  too  and  by  I  had  gone  on  sober  retreats  with  people  who  are  in  12  step  programs  and  then  there  were  things  I  took  out  of  those  rooms  and  those  meetings  that  kind  of  became  part  of  my 
[03:14:30]  humor  eventually  they  left  but  the  only  thing  and I  talked  to  a priest  about  it  a priest  who  was  sober  through  a  12  step  program  and  I  said  because  it's  important  for me  to  respect  the  anonymity  of  all  those  programs  and  not  break  my  personal  anonymity  at  the  level  of  press  radio  film  and  he  said  if  you're  doing  it  on  stage  in  a  comedy  form  it's  a  performance  it's  like  if  you're  an  actor  and  they  say  we  want  you  to  play  this  you  would  do  it  the  only  thing  I  have  not  done  and  will  not  do  is  say  hey  I'm  in  this  program 
[03:15:00]  or  that  program  you  can  what  I  find  is  helpful  is  you  can  talk  about  the  things  you  learn  there  or  you  could  talk  about  the  things  you've  learned  from  people  or  the  personality  traits  the  behavioral  traits  I  would  try  to  avoid  breaking  the  personal  anonymity  because  I  still  think  there's  a  way  to  get  the  jokes  out  and  do  it  without  violating  that  very  important  request  that they  make  and I  understand  that part  of it  but the  jokes  are based  around  13  stepping  how  when you're  out in  a normal 
[03:15:30]  world  you can  get in  trouble  for  taking  advantage  of someone  who is  too drunk  and then  in the  program  world  you get  in trouble  for  taking  advantage  of somebody  who's  not  sober  enough  there's  nowhere  in between  to meet  them  yeah  well you  can talk  about that  I mean  again  phrase it  however  you're  comfortable  but  you know  I don't  think you  should exclude  any type  of  you know  whatever  you want  to talk  about  as a  comedian  I think  you should  talk  about  that one  I would  just say  try to  respect  what 
[03:16:00]  they  request  because  it's  saving  your  life  but  again  I think  there's  a way  to talk  about it  thank you buddy  you're one  of eight  people that  showed up  in Toledo  so thank  you for  coming  man  thank you  buddy  good luck  buddy  okay  let's go  to Chris  in Brooklyn  hey Jim  how you doing  hello Chris  hey I felt  obligated to  tell you  something  because I  don't think  you know  but I  was listening  to the Ozzy 
[03:16:30]  interview  when he  was on  Stern  and when  he recorded  that last  Sabbath album  13  yeah  he was  doing  coke  heroin  and meth  he was  doing  everything  when he  relapsed  he was  doing  everything  yeah no  I do  know  that  it's  funny  I  didn't  know  until  after  he  quit  like he  had come  back  to being  sober  but we  had Ozzy  on the  show  right after  Howard  him and  Geezer  came over  for a half  hour  40 minutes  and we  were talking  about the  different songs  and I  love the  song  Methademic  which is  one of  the extra 
[03:17:00]  songs  so I  was asking  him about  it  I'm like  who was  doing  I said  something  like  where did  that get  inspired by  I was  doing  fucking  meth  so we  talked  about it  a little  bit  but how  did I  feel  about it  I  mean  look  I  love  Ozzy  so I  was  heartbroken  when I  heard  that  he  relapsed  just  for  him  yeah  I  was  shocked  I  heard  your  interview  too  but I  didn't hear  him admit  to doing  it  yeah  yeah  he did  admit it  but what  I love  about Ozzy  is this  there's an  honesty  in him  that most  performers  don't have  and you 
[03:17:30]  know  I think  that's  the beauty  of him  is that  he does  come out  and talk  about it  and he's  not ashamed  of it  and he  says look  this is  what it  was  but I  felt bad  for him  and I  I like  Sharon so  much  as people  so I  feel bad  for them  and I  hope that  he stays  sober  because you  know  when you  love a guy  so much  you want  to just  see him  do well  it's like  Ozzy  you're 64  you've  beaten the odds  you got the  number one  record on the  billboard charts  for the first  time in 40  years  just enjoy it  so hopefully  he will stay  sober this  time and  just allow  himself to  enjoy it 
[03:18:00]  yeah I hope  so man  good talking  to you  thank you buddy  take care  let us  see here  yes  Jim in  California  hi Jim  hey Jimmy  this is Tim  but uh  hey I've got  a kid  no he's not  a kid  he's 20  years old  but he's a  kid to me  and he got  himself in  some trouble  with the law  with you know  drugs and  alcohol  and he's  happened to  go into  rehab  oh he  wants to  go  well he  wants to  go  for part  of it  is you  know  it's going  to help  him you 
[03:18:30]  know  make amends  with the  law  sure  instead of  jail  he goes  to rehab  basically  but what  I'm having  a problem  with is  is he  is really  down on  any organized  religion  and went  into he  went into  one rehab  and he  lasted about  two days  because they  started to  force this  you know the  whole religion  sort of thing  off  well I  personally  I'm sorry  go ahead  oh no I  was just  going to  say that 
[03:19:00]  I don't  know how  to explain  to him  to kind  of let  him find  his own  deal  and I  know that  I listen  to you  and Ronnie  B and  what not  and you  guys kind  of have  a different  take on  that  well I'm  not a  religious  guy either  and I  got sober  when I  was 18  so it  wasn't like  I was like  oh good I  want to go  talk about  God  I didn't  want to  fucking  hear it  so what  people told  me and  I believed  them  me and  Stanhope  debated  being sober  and different 
[03:19:30]  programs  and the  whole God  thing throws  a lot of  people off  the word  God  the 12  steps  were come  up with  in the  40s  you know  1942  I think  so it  was a  different  thinking  back then  a lot  of that  the word  God  like in  him  the him  has been  changed  to just  God  again  so this  gender  neutrality  but it  can mean  good orderly  direction  it can  mean  group  of  drunks  the group  of  drunks  these  people  are a  power  greater  than  myself  it's  only got  to be  a power  greater  than 
[03:20:00]  myself  and again  good orderly  direction  can be  a power  greater  than  myself  it  should  not  be  enough  to  keep  you  from  being  sober  if  you're  allowing  I  don't  like  religion  well  you  know  what  Jim  Norton  is  like  I  am  not  the  fucking  picture  of  spirituality  all  right  what's  more  important  to  you  flushing  your  life  down  the  toilet  or  finding  a way  to  navigate  those  three  letters  you  will  find  a way  because  there  are 
[03:20:30]  atheists  and  agnostics  who live  extremely  long  productive  sober  lives  no  one  is  going  to  say  you  have  to  be  a  Christian  you  have  to  be  a  Muslim  you  have  to  believe  in  God  the  deity  you  do  not  have  to  believe  in  a  deity  you  do  not  have  to  believe  in  Buddha  or  Muhammad  or  something  in  heaven  or  hell  you  can  be  absolutely  as  hardcore  as  pendulet  as  far  as  belief  that  there  is  no  God  or  afterlife  and  still  be  working  the  program  beautifully  so  don't  that's 
[03:21:00]  just  an  excuse  that  we  give  to  ourselves  why  I  can't  do  this  or  why  I  won't  do  this  why  do  these  programs  why  do  they  kind  of  I  don't  know  almost  force  that  everything  that  I've  looked  at  except  for  one  and  one  I  thought  was  really  a  good  program  and  it  turns  out  it  some  Scientology  thing  right  but  why  do  they  why  do  they  put  that  in  there  I  mean  doesn't  that  seem  to  be  like  nowadays  more  of a  kind  of  a  turn  off  I  don't  care  if  it's  a  turn  off  or  not  here's  why  I  say  that  it  works  for 
[03:21:30]  whatever  reason  it's  free  you're  under  zero  obligation  there  is  zero  burden  on  anybody  and  it  works  for  whatever  reason  the  way  the  steps  are  structured  I've  I've  read  the  every  single  ounce  of  my  bullshit  every  manipulative  thing  I do  every  fucking  sneaky  Pete  thing  I do 
[03:22:00]  is  covered  in  the  steps  it's  it's  it's  an  absolute  it's  one  of  the  greatest  writings  in  human  history  that  that  this  fucking  these  these  12  steps  cover  every  piece  of  bullshit  I  try  to  fling  like  you  know  what  I  mean  so  for  whatever  reason  the  spiritual  angle  and  again  spiritual  can  be  completely  non-deity  oriented  is  very  important  because  I do  have  a  spiritual  sickness  to a  certain  degree  and  that's  that  self-centeredness  and that  fucking  obsession 
[03:22:30]  with self  and not  giving  and all  of these  other  things  is  covered  so  for  whatever  reason  dude  why  is  it  still  there  because  it  works  and  I  would  have  been  dead  a  long  time  ago  without  it  so  either  I  have  to  adjust  to  that  or  I  can  just  continue  doing  it  my  way  and  my  way  is  what  got  me  in  all  the  trouble  I  was  in  so  tell  him  he  will  figure  it  out  he  will  learn  to  be  okay  with  it  and  he  does  not  have  to  bend  and  believe  in  any  type  of  a  god  in  heaven  if  he  doesn't  want  to  that's  fine 
[03:23:00]  I'm  using  you  and  Ronnie  as  examples  because  he's  listened  to  you  guys  on  the  radio  when  he's  on  the  truck  with  me  okay  and  he  knows  that  you  guys  have  had  you  know  your  demons  and  your  issues  and  been  through  the  stuff  but  he  kind  of  knows  where  you  stand  too  that's  what  I'm  trying  to  tell  him  look  you  don't  have  to  make  it  you  know  a  higher  God  thing  so  thank you  buddy  thank you  play him  this  break  record  this  and  play  this  for  him  and  tell  him  if  you  had  to  be  Jesus  or  it  had  to  be  God  in  heaven  I  would  not  be 
[03:23:30]  sober  today  if  they  had  forced  anything  down  my  throat  like  that  I  would  not  be  sober  today  they  didn't  they're  like  this  is  what  we  have  if  you  want  what  we  have  and  are  willing  to  go  to  that's  the  key  if  you  want  what  we  have  and  if  you  don't  you  are  more  than  welcome  to  go  back  out  and  live  life  as  you  see  fit  thank  you  for  the  call  thank  you  Jimmy  bye  bye  okay  buddy  the  guy  and  by  what's  the  number  here  Iraq  to  get  more  people  calling  866-969-1969  okay  it's  someone  here  let's  talk to  Billy  in  Atlanta  hi 
[03:24:00]  Billy  hey  Jim  how  are  you  I'm  great  Billy  how  are  you  I'm  excellent  I've  been  clean  and  sober  for  27  years  I've  worked  the  steps  I've  got  a lot  going  on  in  my  life  as  far  as  you  know  own  my  home  have  a  great  job  but  it's  the  relationships  I've  had  just  a  struggle  with  women  and  I  don't  date  really  very  many  women  in  the  program  so  it's 
[03:24:30]  not  that  but  I  think  women  are  just  crazy  in  general  so  yeah  yeah  I  understand  the  difficulty  are  you  a  sex  addict  I  do  look at  the  pictures  on  the  web  yeah  but  I  mean  has  it  become  the  thing  that  you  do  which  has  made  a  relationship  impossible  oh  no  no  nothing  like  that  I  think  it's  just  that  it  seems  to  be  that  white  whale  you  know  it's  that  one  thing  in  my  life 
[03:25:00]  that  I've  never  been  able  to  achieve  yeah  I've had  problems  with it  too  and  you  know  part  of it  is  I  think  when  I'm  single  now  for two  years  I was  joking  about  not being  able to  get a  girl to  lunch  with me  I mean  I was  joking  and I  was  serious  part  of it  is  sometimes  I  think  we're  over  eager  and I  think  Opie said  that to  me  he said  you're  trying  too  hard  and  it's  such  a  basic  simple  advice  but  I  think  he's  right  I  just  women  can  sense  that  shit  not  desperation  not  like  but  just  the  little 
[03:25:30]  neediness  that's  why  married  guys  get  hit  on  all  the  time  because  women  do  not  you  know  women  can  sense  that  and  it's  a  turn  off  for  them  so  I  would  suggest  just  try  to  be  you  know  sometimes  it  helps  just  say  let's  go  out  as  friends  maybe  there's  something  with  women  you're  missing  so  go  out  with  a few  of  them  as  friends  and  really  don't  try  to  fuck  them  or  get  involved  with  them  just  pick  up  some  behavioral  things  from  them  sometimes  that  helps  and  maybe  you'll  find  somebody  I  wish  you  a lot  of  luck  there's 
[03:26:00]  no  real  answer  for  that  one  I  would  just  say  relax  and  be  yourself  you're  doing  something  right  great  I  always  have  a  question  that  has  no  answer  yeah  no  it's  a  tough  one  dude  because  I  don't  know  what  you  look  like  you  know  you  could  look  like  the  fucking  elephant  man  Robert Downey  Jr.  who I've  been  described  as  lately  Jesus  Christ  maybe  chicks  are  intimidated  but I'll  jerk  you  off  yeah  that's  it  I had  a girl  at work  one  time  she  said  you  know  how  guys  are  so 
[03:26:30]  dressed  up  sometimes  and  they  look  so  nice  you're  afraid  they're  not  even  going  to  talk  to  you  I'm  like  really  is  that  what  it  is  I'm  intimidated  well  maybe  that  is  it  you know  just  go out  with  his  friends  a little  bit  you'll  find  somebody  I  appreciate  it  thank you  man  thank you  for  calling  before  we  go  we  got  Bobby's  on  the  phone  before  we  go  to  him  I  didn't  see  Joe 
[03:27:00]  in  Chicago  trying  to  figure  out  if  he  should  cut  his  dad  out  of  his  life  or  not  okay  hi  Joe  I  couldn't  read  you  I  didn't  realize  you're  on  hold  how are  you  Joseph  hey  no  problem  pretty  good  basically  the  situation  is  both  my  dad  and  I  are  incredible  alpha  personalities  and  so  around  his  birthday  about  a month  ago  we  kind  of  gotten  yelling  argument  type  thing  and  he's  of  the 
[03:27:30]  kids  should  bow  down  to  the  father  type  thing  and  so  the  long  story  short  was  he  didn't  tell  me  he  was  carrying  resentment  about  it  afterwards  but  I'm  hearing  from  family  members  that he's  going  around  spreading  lies  such as  I'm  addicted  to  gambling  and I'm  out  gambling  away  my  paycheck  each  month  and  stuff  like  that  and  he's  always  been  dramatic  and all  that  and he's  recently  gone  back  to  smoking  weed  it's 
[03:28:00]  getting  to  the  point  where  I'm  wondering  is it  better  for me  to  just  walk  away  I'm  sorry  how old  are you  and how  old  did you  die  I'm  31  and he's  61  I'm  not  coming  in  saying  I'm  a saint  but to  have  things  made  up  when I  already  have  my  own  problems  to  deal  with  kind  of  sucks  yeah  it's  irritating  but I  mean  do you  think  about  him  dying  and  what  it  would  be  like  if 
[03:28:30]  he  passes  away  it's  one  of  those  words  if  he  was  ill  if  he  needed  ultimate  help  I'd  be  there  for  him  but I  just  I  want to  you know  essentially  just  check  out  I  to  do  I 
[03:29:00]  know  it's  going to  cause  problems  my  sister  has  five  kids  I  just  know  it's  going  to  cause  a  problem  for  everybody  but  me  because  he's  going to  take it  out on  everybody  else  well  what do  you  want  to  do  I  mean  it  sounds  crazy  do you  really  want  to  cut  him  out  of  your  life  like  I  said  I'll  be  there  for him  if  he  is  in  dire  need  but  other than  that  I  don't  want to  deal  with  him  anymore  if  he's  going  to  spread  lies  and  rumors  behind  my  back  I  don't  want to  deal  with  that  but  like  I  said  the  people 
[03:29:30]  who  are  going  to  suffer  from  this  aren't  me  it's  really  my  mom  and  my  sister  and  her  five  kids  well  I  mean  you  know  you  can't  live  for  them  obviously  you  have  to  live  for  yourself  and  if  he's  really  insufferable  then I  guess  don't  deal  with  him  but  you  know  I  got  an  email  from  a  guy  I  was  trying  to  him  greatly  and  I  was  going  to  read  it  on  the  air  and  of 
[03:30:00]  course  you  know  the  I  want  to  fucking  smash  my  cunt  phone  because  we're  not  getting  any  reception  in  here  so  I  would  suggest  if  you  know  maybe  you  could  talk  to  your  dad  or  take  a  little  bit  of  time  off  but  you  know  once  they're  dead  they're  dead  and  you  never  get  that  chance  back  so  you  might  want  to  just  think  about  that  but  if  he's  being  an  insufferable  prick  you don't  have to  deal  with  him  either  yeah  it's  a good  piece  to  you know  I 
[03:30:30]  really  do  worry  about  them  because  he's  hitting  retirement  age  and  he's  going  to  have  all  data  to  make  their  lives  miserable  so  but  again  you  can't  live  for  them  you  gotta  live  for  yourself  but  I  would  say  try  to  make  it  work  if  you  can  thank  you  buddy  very  much  I'm  so  fucking  frustrated  are you  not  getting  the  wifi  in  here  it's  just  the  whole  fucking  thing  put  Bobby  on  the  phone  Bobby  hi  Bobby  hey  what's  up  brother  how are  you  buddy  hey  Jimmy  I've  been  sober  it's  going 
[03:31:00]  to be  three  years  now  in  August  like  you  know  and  all  I  had  to  do  basically  was  say  you  know  my  life  was  a  mess  you  knew  me  you  know  how  I  was  I  was  out  of  control  and  like  talking  to  you  and  Colin  and  even  boss  helped  them  you  know  even  sometimes  when I  talk  to  the  boss  I  want  to  go  back  to  drinking  but  it  really  changed  my  life  for the  better  it  has  nothing  to do  with  like  Jesus  and  all  of  that  it's  about  just  making  yourself  a  better  person  people  don't  realize  that  you  know  they  think  it's 
[03:31:30]  all  about  you  know  oh  you  turn  into  a  Jesus  freak  and  all  that  has  nothing  to do  with  any  beliefs  it's  changing  your  life  for the  better  and  my  life  can't  be  any  better  than  it  is  right  now  by  not  drinking  and  doing  drugs  you're  happy  with  where  you're  at  right  now  totally  I  mean  there's  no  the way  I was  I would  be dead  in two  years  if I  would have  kept  it up  there's  no  way  because  you  can't  you  cannot  continue  to  do  coke  and  to  drink  every 
[03:32:00]  time  you  do  a  show  and  think  you're  going  to  live  there's  no  way  there  is  no  way  and  all  you  got  to  do  is  get  the  people  to  suck  out  of  your  life  and  your  life  is  so  much  better  yeah  I mean  there  are  some  having  some  negative  people  around  does  hurt  and  they  say  you  got  to  change  people  places  and  things  so  yeah  it is  important  that  you  do  have  to  change  the  people  but  I'm  happy  to hear  you're  doing  well  Bobby  you  know  that  no  I  know  I  can't  wait  three  years  and  I'm  going  to  celebrate  by 
[03:32:30]  having  a  nice  soda  attaboy  bye  buddy  I love  Bob  Levy  he's  my  favorite  people  I owe  him  a  lot  let  us  see  let's  talk  to  Danny  in  Illinois  hi  Danny  I'm  well  buddy  how  are  you  I'm  good  a little  confused  I need  your help  sure  I got  divorced  about  three and a half 
[03:33:00]  years ago  at the time  my stepdaughter  at the time  was 19  I just  ran into  her at a  bar  Saturday  night  and  she's  saying  it's a  new body  I got  because I  gotten myself  into great  shape  but  she's  hinting around  that  she wants  to  hook up  like a  booty call  how long  since you've  lived with her  three and a half  years  and  does she  hate  your ex-wife 
[03:33:30]  well  she  my ex-wife  kind of  disowned her  for a little  while  because she  disapproved  of the  boyfriend  she had  at the time  he was  like an  alcoholic  he was  in a  band  and  bad  influence  so  they're  not  in  the  best  relationships  but  the thing  is  with my  ex-wife  I do  have  two  young  daughters  that are  seven  and nine  that  I see  on a  regular  basis  so  I'm  afraid  of  jeopardizing 
[03:34:00]  that  but  it's  a court  order  so she  can't  really  tell me  no  but  my  ex-step  daughter  has  grown up  and  she's  I'm not  going to  lie to you  Jimmy  she is  fucking  amazing  believe me  I've never  had a  stepdaughter  but you  know  my head  is saying  don't do it  my cock  is saying  what are you  a silly  goose  I would  suggest  you don't  do it  because you  have two  kids with  the ex  to me  the daughter  is doing  it  for some  kind  of a  weird  reason  like  maybe  she  just  likes  you  or  maybe  it's  revenge  on her  mother  or  whatever  it is  it can  only 
[03:34:30]  end  badly  and  maybe  the  court  order  is  the  court  order  with  you  seeing  the  kids  with  your  ex-wife  but  she  can  make  it  hard  she  can  make  it  unpleasant  and  when  it  comes  to  a  relationship  with  your  children  do  you  want  to  have  because  that  dude  if  you  if  you  fuck  the  ex-step  daughter  that's  unforgivable  your  relationship  with  the  ex-wife  even  if  it's  bad  now  will  be  irreparable  and  she  will  probably  go out  of her  way  to  fuck  you  over  at  every  chance  any way  she  can  yeah 
[03:35:00]  I  could  see her  doing  that  because  she  is  for lack  of a  better  word  she  is  a  spiteful  bitch  but  yeah  the  head  on top  me  was  thinking  you  know  what  that  would  be  the  ultimate  fuck  you  to  my  ex  and  the  head  on  the  bottom  was  saying  dude  why  didn't  you  fuck  her  already  but  yeah  I  think  you  know  the  answer  I  would  suggest  not  doing  it  and  again  not  out of  a  moral  reason  but  I  mean  she  simply  logistically  can  make  your  life  very  unpleasant  if  the  ex-wife  finds  out 
[03:35:30]  and  you  don't  need  dude  just  jerk  off  fucking  cum  in  your  own  belly  button  and  then  just  scoop  it  out  and  go  I'm  glad  I  didn't  do  that  no  more  headaches  alright  I  just  want to say  one thing  that divorce  was really  depressing  at the time  and I gotta  say that  I owe you  big because  watching  Monster Rain  three or  four nights  every week  that  you know

[03:37:00]  pretty  yeah well  she came  over for  the weekend  you know  to kind  of hang  out  she was  in town  and everything  had a few  margaritas  we did  the deed  and I'm  going to  tell you  un-fucking  believable  yeah it was  great huh  oh my  god  un-fucking  believable  I don't have  the kind  of problem  the other  guy has  me and  her step  or her  mom  we don't  have any  kids together  nothing like 
[03:37:30]  that  there's no  you know  nothing together  but yeah  I'm going to  tell you  I kind of  went against  a little bit  against your  advice  yeah  it  wow  my only  problem is  now  now what  so  stamina  is not  you know  your phone  is cut  out  god damn  it  of all  the phones  I don't  want to  cut out  Bob  who fucked  the step  daughter  here he is  so your  stamina  you came  quick  Bob 
[03:38:00]  you're  going to  have to  call back  believe me  we didn't  hang up  on you  oh for  Pete's  sake  god damn  cell phones  alright Bob  call back  please  because I  do want  to hear  your story  Chris in  New Jersey  let's talk  to you  hi Chris  hey Jimmy  hi buddy  love you buddy  thank you  thank you so  much  hey I  have a  I don't  know I  think I'm  just kind  of fucked  up in  my own  head  I've been 
[03:38:30]  dating a  girl now  for probably  about five  or six  months and  it's getting  pretty serious  it's been  great it's  been like  nothing but  awesome she's  great you  know I  can't  complain but  last night  the I  don't know  even know how  it came up  but the  topic of  previous  relationships  and how  many sexual  partners you  have and all  that kind  of snuck  its way  into the  conversation  sure and  she kind  of brushed 
[03:39:00]  it off and  just didn't  want to talk  about it at  all and  you know I  I've done  I've done my  share of but  I haven't been  crazy I mean  how many  15  okay  I'm 26  how old is  she  she's the same  age as me  so she didn't  want to answer  did she say  none of your  business or I  don't want to  talk about it  yeah she  just didn't  want to talk  about it  she was like  I knew this  would eventually  come up  she's like I  was waiting  for this to  come up  you know  well she's  either had 
[03:39:30]  three and  she's embarrassed  by her low  number or  your number  745 and  she's embarrassed  by that  there's obviously  a reason  maybe you know  dude it  might  like I  dated a girl  many years ago  who told me  she had had  sex with a  celebrity  and I  remember being  so angry  that she  wouldn't tell  me who it  was  we were  together  for like  a year  she eventually  did tell me  it was Robert  Reed  what bad luck  for me  but you know  I was so mad  at her  but looking back 
[03:40:00]  on it  she just didn't  want to break  the other person's  trust and she  wanted to make  sure that I  wouldn't  so maybe this  girl will tell  you as time  goes on  maybe she just  needs to know  she can trust  you  the thing  is I  don't even  know if  I want  to know  I mean  I don't  think I  don't even  think I  do want  to know  I think  I think  it could  be  I don't  think it  really  should even  affect me  but for  some reason  in my  head  it makes  me nervous  nah  don't let  it do  because what  you see  is who  she is  who cares  like  if she's  fucked  three people  good for  her  if she's  fucked  180 
[03:40:30]  hey look  you're  fucking  a girl  who's  done some  practice  good  I love  a girl  with a  shitty  history  like not  only would  I want  to know  how many  I'd want  to know  how big  their dicks  were and  how much  better they  fucked her  than I'm  fucking her  that would  turn me on  like a lot  dude I used  to be  intimidated by  that like  if a girl  dated guys  with big  cocks  like my  dick's fine  but it's  not like  you know  you wouldn't  put it on  the cover  of fucking  cock weekly  but dude  the idea  now like  I want  to know  if they  fuck guys  with big  dicks  and how  great  like I  made them  pornographic 
[03:41:00]  so their  past is no  longer a  threat to  me  it turns  me on  so don't  let that  throw you  that's just  silly  and you know  yeah  and you know  what like  it's most  most of me  and when I'm  like being  rational it  doesn't at all  but in a  moment of  weakness  like last  night it was  something I  thought about  and I was  like well  if she doesn't  want to tell  me then  what's going  on but I  know that in  the grand  scheme of  things it  really doesn't  matter because  I trust her  completely and  I love her so  it really doesn't  matter  but you know  I kind of 
[03:41:30]  just needed  someone to  yeah it  doesn't matter  dude I'll  tell you what  it doesn't  matter because  men are  trained that  conquests are  good women  are trained  that you're a  whore if you  fuck a bunch  of people so  you know again  she's got that  same training  that you and  I have had  just in the  reverse so you  know if she  doesn't want to  talk about it  you know give  her a break  yeah no and  one other thing  Jimmy I just  want to thank  you a long  time ago years  ago you I  had contacted  you I was I  was pretty down  and out and I  had sent you a  message and to  date it on 
[03:42:00]  my space and  you responded by  giving me a  couple tickets to  one of your  shows at  Caroline's and  you put me on  your guest list  and that's always  really stuck with  me and I  you know I've  always loved you  loved you on the  show and loved  your comedy and  for someone to do  something like that  for somebody they  have no no  connection to that's  always really stuck  with me so I  wanted to thank you  you're welcome  buddy and if you  were depressed and I  gave you tickets to  my show I was  probably trying to  get you to finish  yourself off because  that normally will do  it that's the last  step people take is  they see me live and  they're like there's  nothing else to live 
[03:42:30]  for I'm fucking  hanging myself good  luck brother I'm  happy you're doing  okay thank you all  right be good buddy  all right Bob is  back let's talk to  Bob hi buddy what  were you saying that  you you came quick  no no no I mean  well I mean you  know 15 20 minutes  you know that's good  all that quick at 41  years old that's great  but basically I mean  you know I finally  get Anthony I there's  just something you 
[03:43:00]  you totally forget  when you're dating  women your own age  you know and you  when you're in your  40s what a new  bile 21 year old  kid he feels like  it's un-fucking  believable man I  I highly suggest you  know I mean and  talking about they  smell like you know  homework and bubble  gum oh my god and  I just can't it you  know I'm definitely  glad that I did it  hopefully it'll happen  a couple more times  yeah I don't blame 
[03:43:30]  you I mean again like  I said my advice to  the other guy was more  logistical than moral  as long as it doesn't  feel predatory I mean  it's hard for me to  say that I wouldn't do  it because you sent  pictures she's cute so  you know happy humping  good luck my friend all  right thank you much  Jimmy bye enjoy make  sure you don't get a  pregnant please let's  see let's see oh  Chris in New Jersey he  and I have probably  crossed paths hello  Chris hey Jimmy how  are you I'm good buddy  how are you I'm not as  good as you but I'm  okay you have a  girlfriend as an  escort huh yeah we 
[03:44:00]  spoke about this oh  yeah okay I remember  sure yep and I'll just  to let you know I did  celebrate a year clean  and sober recently  congratulations that's good  news thank you thank you  and it's all going good  but um yeah so we're  still together everything's  going pretty good um I  have uh encountered uh I  do go out and and sample  some escorts myself now  sure uh just to uh I  guess just to kind of deal  with it a little bit yeah  because when I do when I  do get off I tend to not 
[03:44:30]  get so angry that she's  still out there doing it  but um I have I have a  problem keeping it up  it's getting hard when I  get to these girls uh and  then some of them just  cannot perform like my  like my girl does and it's  so hard I mean she just  knows me so well sure plus  you're also probably doing  them for the wrong reason  you know you're doing them  to make it even Steven and  to even the score and not  because you're really horny  and that's the problem I've  had where I jerk off when  I'm not horny or I do  things when I'm not horny  because I just want peace  or I want that comforting 
[03:45:00]  feeling you get when you're  being sexual so try to  just do it for the right  reason because when you  do it for the wrong  reason um sex becomes  bad right dad it's kids  you know no matter how  many I've seen the list  of you know she could  probably do eight ten guys  in a day I'm lucky I can  get to one woman oh wow  that's great you know when  you see that it's just like  damn you know but yeah so  uh I will you know the  last time I spoke to you  uh I was going to confront 
[03:45:30]  her on it but uh we're  not at that situation  oh wait you still haven't  talked to her about it  no not yet because I'm  waiting we're supposed to  uh get a place together  and I'm thinking that  would might be oh you  haven't she doesn't know  that you know she's an  escort no she does know  but she says she's not  doing it she says she's  working other girls and I  I read about her on uh  that um I know the site  yes you know what I mean  I fuck yeah and I know  it's her you know I know  her technique I know what  it's fucking send me a  link oh she sounds like a 
[03:46:00]  great girl uh definitely  will be good my friend  good luck all right thanks  bye uh let's see David in  Louisiana Louisiana Dave  we're going to call you  that's your new name on the  show hey how are you hi  Louisiana Dave welcome to  the show thank you it's  good to be on the show  you're good buddy what's  up well I've been told by  numerous people that I'm a  sex addict okay I want to  dicks I want to get an  answer from a pro okay well 
[03:46:30]  why do you what what do  you think first of all to a  degree yeah okay I gotta get  myself whether it's myself or  whatever I've got to get off  at least two or three times a  day or I'm just I go nuts I'm  not satisfied yeah uh it has  caused me to cheat on my wife  sure I got caught with four  different women uh not  physically uh due to my  accidental leaving a old  cell phone laying on the  coffee table and driving a 
[03:47:00]  truck over the road I left  out and well somebody decided  they would go through the  old phone and they found a  bunch of old text messages  but um I can't get enough  it's been that I lost my  virginity at 17 I mean I'm  not going around humping  pillows and rounding the  corner and start humping  walls or anything but I just  right can't get enough of that  feeling and that's what sex  addicts do by the way we  tell our we we congratulate  ourselves by pointing out the  things we're not doing like  you know what I mean like I 
[03:47:30]  do so many things but I'll go  well I'm not fucking babies in  the soft spot and I'll say  that doesn't make me a bad  person well I never jerked off  on a porcupine but you know  what we know what it's doing  to us and I and with sex it's  so weird because it does feel  good it is a healthy normal  natural part of life but the  problem is it begins to uh take  over and like I said a lot of  times I do it for the wrong  reasons I do when I'm not  horny a lot of times dude if  you're coming three times a day 
[03:48:00]  chances are it's an escape it's  like any other it's like food or  drugs or drinking it's a way to  remove me from what's happening  now to zone me out like that high  we get like in the middle of a  good jack when you find the good  scene in a porno it's that  fucking zoned out high you get  and then we wind up chasing  that high all the time and it  really is uncapturable we get it  briefly and then it escapes and  eludes us and we have to up the  ante and continue chasing it and 
[03:48:30]  the problem is not more again not  morally like you're terrible for  being a sex addict it's that it  removes so many things from us and  it eats so much time and it takes  so many real experiences away um  you know there's so many times  where we could be having real  interactions with people but we're  just zoned out jerking off or  having you know monetary  interactions with them where we're  not looking at them as people  because we're purely sexualized  and that's where it gets to be bad  you know right well it's still to 
[03:49:00]  the point where I mean one of those  four girls I'll still see on and off  for the last three years and I mean  I just saw her this past Saturday  but I don't I mean I've gone as far  as just sitting there just be not  really intentionally doing it just  sitting there or watching TV and you  see a commercial or you're watching  a news lady or whatever I'm like  well does she have fucking drawers on  or she got a bra on or what yeah  that's that's that's sexualizing  every person uh even if it's not 
[03:49:30]  somebody you want to fuck like  you'll see a stranger and wonder I  wonder how big their dick is or how  big and it's not at all a second  it could be a 90 year old man but  you think this crazy shit because  everybody is just that it's almost  like seeing everybody as Jewish or  black or Irish you just see somebody  as one thing um and their humanity  is second like you know what I mean  and it doesn't mean that you want to  fuck all people at all but it's just  this twisted way like you probably  think that about women that you  don't want to fuck too like you know 
[03:50:00]  you'll see an awful looking woman  wonder what her pussy looks like like  it's completely seeing the humanity  second um and again I still struggle  with that so I'm not preaching to you  I understand what it is well maybe  you can help me with this too when I  try to have sex with my wife I can't  keep it up of course not because  she's normal and because it's  healthy to have sex with your wife  she might not look as good as the  other girls and you probably feel  guilty there's a you know there's a  lot of head stuff going on I have to  think of the other shit that goes on 
[03:50:30]  yeah that's the other thing she's not  into the freaky shit that I like and  this other girl that I've been doing on  and off for the last three years  Jesus Christ that's everything I've  ever wanted and she I mean she takes  it in all three holes uh she swallows  she does this she does that I mean  you name it we've done it and I just  can't get enough of that kind of shit  and then then there's the fact that I  just can't get enough of that feeling  in general yeah it's a very tough one to 
[03:51:00]  quit uh but again if your wife has  already caught you maybe she knows what  you're doing um and is letting you do  it I don't know but what is your real  question I mean you you know you're a  sex addict you don't even need to ask  that like you know that you probably  are so the question is are you in is  life okay for you now or do you want to  change it uh truthfully the sex part no  I don't really want to change it because  I can't get it at home but that way  because I mean when at home it's I mean  I've had her tell me I'm not a I'm not a 
[03:51:30]  porn star don't be putting me in a hundred  positions yeah that's irritating I'll be  honest with you I'm not saying anyone  deserves to be cheated on but how about  this if you're a woman out there and  your husband wants to fuck you like it's  porn how about this fucking muster up  and fuck them like it's porn or try  they wonder why what I'm not enough for  you no I've heard that too of course  yeah we all have and they I can see if  you wanted to fuck other girls if she's  getting mad but yeah I'm not a porn star 
[03:52:00]  I know dummy but I'm fucking you anyway  so could you at least pretend that you  like porn or could you at least try to  learn something from them I hate that  shit that's lazy thinking that women do  I'll talk about a woman that used to suck  my cock for breakfast now I yeah that's  that goes that does go I bet I'm still  with her we've been to been married  been together for married for 18 years  been together for 19 years but it's just 
[03:52:30]  I don't know what it is it's just I got to  have all the other shit I didn't know if I  was actually an addict so I figured I'd call I  didn't even know you had a show that my  connection's been uh turned off for uh shit  a year I turn it back on you got a show  and I'm listening to this after I listen to  ONA and you and then it's like wow  thank you bud I need to do well I I thank you  very much for the call it sounds to me like  you are um but again if your life is not  unmanageable and you don't want to change  it I can't say change it let's go to AJ in 
[03:53:00]  California who wants to repair his  relationship with his dad  hey Jim first of all you're amazing  buddy thank you so much fun to listen to  so smart oh thank you it's such a jackhole  at the same time which is awesome  Heather Heather Mills with Larry King  pulling her leg off that's that's that's  great thank you yeah that was a fun one  um so so basically you know my my mom  uh divorced my biological dad when I was  one both of them alcoholic addicts he  attempted suicide 10 times and she was just 
[03:53:30]  like you know what I'm not going to do  this so she she she remarries and before  she remarries she's still drinking and  using and and the guy that she met was  drinking and using and they both went to  AA and they said hey you know you know  there's both the sponsors said before you  get together you live together a year  sober and you know so you know what you  know you're out of the haze and this is  what you really want so they do they get  married and he was the man that you  know essentially raised me okay there so  their marriage is built on the foundation  of sobriety and about seven years into 
[03:54:00]  the marriage she finds some pot in this  car which isn't a big deal that it's  pot but at the same time it's a relapse  yeah any relapse is a relapse you know  so so big blowout don't ever do it again  you know whatever so then you know go  you know five six more years and he  starts having these crazy migraine  headaches I've moved on and I have moved  out of town and he was starting college  and I started start a career and he's  having these crazy migraines no one can  figure out what's going on and going to  the Mayo Clinic and all these places come  to find out long story short that he's 
[03:54:30]  been started with Vicodin then went to  you know that coke and and and then I  mean he had you know a couple doctor  friends that were just giving them you  know meds and so it's a relapse that  migraines were because of withdrawals and  and no one and we couldn't figure out why I  mean how do you not find this in talk  screens or whatever so anyways he ends  up practically losing the business I have  to come back from San Diego to come you  know move back home to help with the  family business keep it afloat and he's  got this you know fucking resentment 
[03:55:00]  against everybody else that we can you  know he can't understand why we're upset  with him when he keeps saying he did this  to himself that he didn't do it to us  that's the selfish alcoholic addict  thinking we think we're only hurting  ourselves that's the oldest one in the  book  the crazy thing is he's on the board of  directors for like those sobriety recovery  locations and it's a small town that you  know that we're from so everyone knows  everyone's bullshit and so now the whole  town knows what's going on like what a  hypocrite that you know his his sponsor 
[03:55:30]  is like the chairman of the sobriety  ranch and so now you know we're trying  to you know and he has just the audacity  that like to look down at us and I'm  like I have a real hard time forgiving  him and and it's just a sense of  entitlement that just kills me yeah I mean  look they say that alcoholics drug addicts  are self-centered in the extreme and we  are especially if we're actively using  or if we're not working any kind of a  12-step or any other kind of program so  your question is you want to repair the  relationship with him but you're mad at  him  well I want to repair the relationship 
[03:56:00]  because you know you hear like what you  said earlier about you know it when he's  gone you know am I going to resent  myself for not you know trying to take  high moral ground I mean I grew up in  Alateen and I mean I was I was in the  program before I was you know I was 10  you know practically and you know so I've  always been around it but you know he he I  mean him working the thing and he's  still like moderately drinking now he's  they've got divorced okay she was like  you know what screw it I'm done and he's  remarried and said you know and since and  he's still drinking and I'm just like it's  so hard for me to see him drink sure and 
[03:56:30]  and know that like and then and he left  my mom after they were married for 25  years and and yet he you know I have to  forgive him and it's like I'm sure you  had people call that it sucks when you  have to be your parents parent yeah that's  what I feel like I'm being well I mean  again it's very frustrating but you can't  make somebody get sober so your choice is  do you leave him until he gets sober  like I mean out of your life and risk  him or or do you just kind of accept him  for what he is right now and you know 
[03:57:00]  keep a distance but keep a relationship I  mean there might be a way to do that if  he as long as his drinking and drugging is  not totally fucking up your life if you  just don't like them different yeah we  just we live in separate towns I've got a  two-year-old son that he wants to be a  grandparent to and you know so that's the  part you know where our paths do cross  sure and it's not like he it's not like  he's a flaming lunatic you know alcoholic  addict when he's around my kid you know  he keeps him moderate he'll have a couple  of beers or something like that but like  just the fact that like he he wants  everyone else to let it go because he's 
[03:57:30]  let it go it's like where the fuck do you  get off you know to say you know after  five years of putting us through the  ringer of lying cheating and stealing you  know to use to buy drugs you know yeah I  mean that is a tough one and I understand  why you're resentful and again the  decision you have to make is are you  mad at him enough to cut the  relationship totally off or can you just  kind of as they say live and let live  if long as it's not affecting you or  your family that's all that's a big plus  I mean I mean a big asterisk if it's not  affecting you or your family sometimes 
[03:58:00]  live and let live if that's what he  chooses to do and you still love him and  you know that he can still be a good  grandparent just keep a distance and just  be careful with it but I wouldn't  suggest cutting him out of your life  because you know you you being there  might be one of the more sane things he  has in his life because he's hurting  more than he's letting on whether he's  letting it on or not it's still  bothering him deep down well and healthy  anchors are important too you know so  I mean maybe that's my part of giving  back for him being my dad even though  you know everyone makes mistakes yeah  of course man I mean you can't make  him get sober and you don't need to 
[03:58:30]  totally cut somebody out of your life  just because they're drinking you know  I would just suggest don't let them wreck  your life and be very cognizant of  that or aware of that okay right  thanks good luck sorry guys we  couldn't get to you the guy who's  been dating an ex-ex escort enjoy it  she'll probably fuck you well the guy  who wants to ask where I got sober in  New Jersey and is a table shower  illegal I don't know and to the guy  who called up and said what's my  technique for jerking off I grab my  dick and I pull it that's my and I put 
[03:59:00]  it back and I pull it and I put it  back repeat thank you guys very much  see you tomorrow on the Opie and  Anthony show and next week on my  advice show Ron is now done dealing  with your bullshit he'll be back next  Wednesday at 10 a.m. Eastern 7 Pacific  but you listen to episodes of the Jim  Norton show whenever you want to go to  SiriusXM.com slash on demand for  details  you  you  you  you  you </pre>
