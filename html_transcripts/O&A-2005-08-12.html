<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie and Jim Norton, engaging in their usual vulgar banter, insulting their staff, Ben and Steve, and making nonsensical noises.  Norton recounted receiving a terrible Scarface shirt from his parents, leading to further mockery of his mother's gift-giving.  They then previewed upcoming guests: Eddie Griffin, who would call in to discuss *Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo*, and Howie Mandel, who would be a guest in studio.  This prompted a recollection of an awkward encounter on *Tough Crowd* involving a contagious illness.  The hosts proceeded to read aloud scathing reviews of *Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo*.

A substantial portion of the show focused on Opie's rage over director James Toback hitting on his girlfriend, Lindsay, at a bank.  Opie and Anthony investigated Toback's filmography, revealing a pattern of explicit sexual content and accusations of exploiting young actresses.  They detailed these allegations and read both positive and negative reviews of Toback's films, interspersed with listener calls offering commentary on the situation and Opie’s reaction.

The show then shifted to discussing the resignation of a priest from St. Patrick's Cathedral due to a sex scandal involving his secretary, followed by a brief discussion of a teacher having sex with a minor.  This transitioned into mockery of an education panel focusing on the lessons of slavery, with more offensive commentary from the hosts.  A short, nonsensical interlude featuring "Sandy Kane" and "James Brown" followed.

The next segment focused on humorous misinterpretations of crime eyewitness accounts, particularly those given by Black individuals, the comedic stylings of news reporter John Montone, and a call from Sandy Kane.  The hosts joked about news clips showcasing misinterpretations of crime scenes, including one titled "Boo Got Shot," providing a comedic translation of the confusing eyewitness account.  A clip of John Montone reporting on a man’s unhealthy French fry consumption was played.  The majority of this segment was dominated by Sandy Kane’s call, where she recounted multiple rape claims, including alleged incidents with a Latin man and a truck driver, and a forced act of oral sex on Phil Spector at gunpoint.  Her narrative was interspersed with the hosts' sarcastic reactions. She also promoted her comedy shows and complained about a comedy club owner.  The segment ended with discussions about Jimmy's foot problems and a call from Francine, a former intern and comedian, detailing her experiences with a sexually suggestive boss who gave her unsolicited money.

A significant portion of the show centered on Francine, a female intern working in real estate.  The hosts discussed her workplace experiences, including a potentially suggestive encounter with a coworker and her fear of a Black man with a backpack on the subway. Francine then delivered the news with sarcastic commentary, focusing on Catholic sex scandals and Janine Pirro's campaign.  Numerous listener calls followed, including a game where Francine guessed state capitals.  Her impending move to Maryland to obtain a driver's license was mocked.  They played an audio clip of a woman describing a shooting incident in colloquial terms, which Francine failed to interpret.  The conversation frequently turned sexually suggestive, discussing Francine's attractiveness, the hosts' sexual experiences, and their opinions on celebrities.  Francine participated in a trivia game, and a graphic account of a past sexual encounter with a college professor was shared.  A listener commented on the show's quality change since moving to satellite radio.

The show resumed with the hosts discussing positive listener feedback on a New York radio message board, contrasting their satellite radio show with their previous commercial experience. They highlighted the increased creative freedom, exemplified by their coverage of Pat O'Brien's sex tapes, and listener-driven promotions, including billboards attacking Jim Phillips.  They discussed the limitations of commercial radio compared to their current unfettered approach, mentioning contests like "Whip Him Out Wednesday" and "Assault on the Media."  The conversation shifted to Starbucks' commercial success and *The Aristocrats*, focusing on its structure and the comedians involved.  A furry animal entered the studio, leading to a humorous anecdote about Steve foraging for food, followed by a discussion of a documentary about a man killed by bears.

Eddie Griffin called in to promote *Deuce Bigelow: European Gigolo*, discussing filming in Amsterdam and its legal prostitution and cannabis culture.  He also discussed portraying Richard Pryor and Pryor's health struggles with MS.  The call was cut short due to technical issues.  The hosts then discussed *Life Aquatic*, with listener calls offering varied interpretations.  Howie Mandel arrived in studio, discussing his OCD, including his avoidance of handshakes and elaborate hotel room preparations.  He recounted a harrowing potty training incident with his daughter involving urine and a ravine.  He explained his approach to managing his OCD.

The final segment featured Howie Mandel extensively discussing his OCD and germophobia, particularly his aversion to handshakes. He detailed methods to avoid them and the challenges of performing comedy. He promoted his Bravo show, "Hidden Howie."  The conversation included tangents about *The Aristocrats*, using vulgar language ("cunt"), and his thoughts on other comedians' performances.  Hypothetical scenarios involving sexual acts and bodily fluids were discussed, provoking crude responses. A bizarre conversation about someone defecating on Mandel ensued.  A Paisano's commercial aired. The segment concluded with the hosts expressing dislike for someone named Steve.

[00:05:30]  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  For some reason or another, you sound a little taller on radio.  There's always one.  For some reason or another.  There's always one that gets us going.  Good morning.  Hi.  And welcome to the Opie and Anthony program. 
[00:06:00]  Spreading the virus across America thanks to XM Satellite Radio.  The Opie virus.  Fuck.  Jesus.  What are you mowing down?  What are you eating?  Enough with the mayonnaise.  That's not mayonnaise.  It's cream cheese.  Salted bagel.  It came.  I just saw white.  He was fighting with that.  He looked like a shark.  He looked like a shark.  His eyes rolled back white.  And there was the cream cheese flying out of his mouth. 
[00:06:30]  He couldn't get the piece of bagel off.  Just tearing at it.  You shouldn't have to wipe your hands like you're doing right now just from eating a bagel.  Especially when you have one bite in.  Oh, my goodness.  That's how they made it.  You're an animal.  Jesus.  That's great.  Ah.  Where were we?  Nice shirt, Jimmy.  Jesus Christ.  This is the shirt my parents gave me for my birthday. 
[00:07:00]  It was July 19th.  They gave me this.  It's a red Scarface shirt.  It could be the worst shirt ever given to anybody for any situation.  I don't know who would wear that shirt.  And you could not possibly wash that with any other clothes.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're right.  Anything you want.  You could wash that with black pants and somehow they would come out red.  It says, it's got like a weird painting picture of Pacino.  It just says, something, bury.  I bury those cockroaches.  I bury those cockroaches in a Scarface. 
[00:07:30]  And that, you know, parents are very sweet.  I'm sure they're very caring and really thought they were getting you something you really  was liked and cool.  But wow.  That is an awful shirt.  Horrible.  It's a horrible piece of clothing.  Did you open it with them there?  They might have mailed it to me.  Oh, yeah?  Okay.  Knowing you, they mailed it to you.  They would have been standing there smiling as you open it. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, he's going to love this.  And you've got to take it out and go, ooh.  Yeah.  Because the clothing I get from them is usually a sweater from Van Heusen.  Mom.  Van Heusen.  Van Heusen blows.  Nobody wears Van Heusen sweaters.  Like 1964.  It's awful.  Van Heusen.  Your mom listens to the show every day.  That's why she has to learn that Van Heusen, I'll never, the homeless, there's a homeless  guy right now enjoying my Christmas sweater. 
[00:08:30]  Van Heusen.  Van Heusen.  I finally got my mom to the point where she just gives me gift certificates.  Thank God.  Only way to do it.  Is that it?  Thank God.  My mother refuses to do the gift certificate thing, but she'll get me like pants and shirts  and stuff.  But then in that also is underwear in those boxes that we talk about with the guys on  the front pretty much nude with the big junk in the front of the underwear.  What am I, Mommy, giving me those?  No.  Take them out of the box at least. 
[00:09:00]  Because you know she went shopping thinking, all right, my son's cock will look terrific  at least.  Yeah, I know.  Well, that's what you think.  Don't be weighing that.  Don't look at that and go, okay.  I remember changing him as a baby and he was packed pretty good.  You make a good point, don't you now?  All right.  We got lots to do today.  Where's our one sheet?  Here it is.  Hearing sounds.  We actually got in the office for today and lots of fun things.  We got guests, too.  No, stop it. 
[00:09:30]  Eddie Griffin may call in today.  At least we're getting people that might call in now.  All right.  He's in a Deuce Bigelow sequel?  Yeah.  Look, see?  That's why.  That's why.  What if he's listening to the show going, all right, let me think this up.  Let me see if this is the kind of show I want to be on.  That was the case.  I think at this point he has no choice because the movie's getting horrendous reviews. 
[00:10:00]  Absolutely horrendous reviews.  We're going to make believe that the movie, you know, is getting killed by the critics.  Well, I heard it got some really good laughs.  Zero stars in the one New York paper and I think a half a star in the other paper.  I love the zero star reviews.  By the way, if you were listening, this one sheet would say Eddie Griffin will not be calling in if he was listening to this program.  Well, we'll see if he calls in.  He might want to hide, actually. 
[00:10:30]  Not from us.  I'm just saying in general because why did they even make another Deuce Bigelow movie?  Why did he make one?  Well, the first one, I didn't like it.  There was a couple scenes that were kind of, you kind of went, I never saw the Deuce Bigelow movie.  But there was no reason to make a sequel.  No.  And then to just, you know, redo the original like they do.  So, I don't know.  No, he's in the Deuce Bigelow movie and he might call in today.  Yeah, I heard the review on wins driving in, on 1010 wins, and not favorable. 
[00:11:00]  No.  Brutal.  Rob Schneider provides new meaning to the term ugly American with Deuce Bigelow, European gigolo.  Also, a vile and laughless follow-up to his 1999 hit, which hardly called out for a sequel.  Hardly.  It's essentially a replay of the first film with Schneider's dim-witted, now-balding man-whore peddling his wares in Amsterdam,  which never looked worse than, in this cheesy-looking comedy. 
[00:11:30]  Cheesy.  Forced to leave California, California, excuse me, after accidentally provoking a school of dolphins into a murderous rage.  Deuce arrives in Europe, toting the artificial leg of his late wife who died in a shark attack on their honeymoon.  Wow. 
[00:12:00]  And it goes on and on.  He stinks, and I don't like him.  Well, we'll see what happens.  So hopefully Eddie Griffin will call in.  We'll talk about some stuff with him.  Howie Mandel in studio today.  Come on!  No way.  Is that real?  Really?  I'm sure it'll come.  Hopefully.  I have my Howie photo that I have to have one of the interns blow up so I can ask him to sign it.  Ooh.  Very good.  We did Tough Crowd together.  Tough Crowd?  Yeah, didn't you freak him out, though?  Yeah, I think they told him I had AIDS.  But anything else, I don't know.  Ben, Ben, Ben, like, left me a message. 
[00:12:30]  And Ben's like, uh, try that one again.  Yeah, that'll work twice.  It's rapid.  They just sat us on the couch together, and someone had the virus.  Yeah.  It was a little uncomfortable.  Yeah.  Yeah, well, uh, we've, uh, got to ask him about that whole thing.  Why, you want to ask him what methods he's been using so you can use a few for yourself?  You guys are going to get along fantastically.  I'm going to out-creep him.  Uh, Rotten Tomatoes, my favorite movie review site, uh, gave, uh, the Deuce Bigelow movie 
[00:13:00]  a 4% rating.  Ooh, that's good.  But you've got to be 50% or better to get a, uh, positive review on RottenTomatoes.com.  4%.  4%.  There's a mood and a market for really low and dumb humor, but Deuce Bigelow, European  Gigolo doesn't even seem to be aiming that high.  Oh.  Wow.  Uh, one of those sequels that seem to have been made less out of inspiration than because  the Ray Cope production deal came along. 
[00:13:30]  What?  Then it goes on and on.  Just awful.  All right.  All right.  Confirmed.  Eddie Griffin calling in at 10 a.m.  I can't wait to see Deuce Bigelow.  I can't wait.  I think that's going to be a good movie.  I think there's going to be a lot of laughs in it.  European Gigolo.  It looks hysterical from the commercials.  That's right.  You know, he walks, uh, walks to the door and that big woman's there.  We didn't see that in the first one, did we?  Oh.  That's right.  We did.  Well, he's a comedian, right? 
[00:14:00]  Who?  Eddie Griffin?  Oh, yeah, he's a stand-up.  Yeah.  So, you know, he can understand and have some fun with this, right?  You always know.  I mean, how am I know?  Let's just be talking about films like I've done a few, but you can usually tell.  Blockbuster, Superman, Spider-Man.  Yeah, but I kind of knew all along that was good.  Toby and I talked a lot.  Yeah.  He'd call me.  All right.  So, I'm just very distracted by your Al Pacino.  You should be.  It's awful.  It's like sitting across the fucking table from a nuclear explosion. 
[00:14:30]  It's just red and horrible.  You've got to put those big goggles on just to look at Jimmy.  Yeah, I was going to say, it's so bright, my eyes are getting all freaked out already.  It's terrible.  It's terrible.  Mom, the shirt is terrible.  Where did she get that?  I don't know.  Mom.  The boys hate Jimmy.  Sure.  They hate it.  The boys.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me.  Jesus.  Jimmy gets a Van Heusen.  This is patently offensive.  It's so bright. 
[00:15:00]  Don't you buy those at, like, little shops and stands somewhere?  Spencer's or something.  Where did she get that?  I don't know.  She's shopping for you at Spencer's like you're 16.  I'm sure it was between this and the farting little statue.  The black light.  We don't want one of those in the house.  Stagelow poster.  No.  More bad reviews coming in for Deuce Bigelow?  No.  At 4%?  Oh, these are the ones that were positive?  Yeah, no. 
[00:15:30]  They found...  These are all the positive reviews.  They take movie reviews from all over the country.  Sometimes it's over 100.  In this case, Deuce Bigelow has three good reviews.  Call me immoral.  Call me insensitive.  Call me lewd.  But I laughed.  From the Balcony.  That's the name of the publication.  From the Balcony.  Bill Clark.  Deuce 2 is dumb, crude, juvenile.  Engrossed, but it is also one of the funniest films I've seen in ages.  As long as you do not get offended easily, you may have a good time.  That's by Skewed and Reviewed. 
[00:16:00]  Have you ever heard of that publication or website?  Definitely not art, but it's quite funny for a sequel.  Real talk movie reviews.  All right.  So there you go.  Positive reviews.  Actually, let's save these.  Now it sounds great.  We can read these to Eddie Griffin.  Right.  Don't read that other sheet to him.  Lose him as a guest.  All right.  Speaking of movies, I had another situation yesterday.  Hey. 
[00:16:30]  Situation.  Situation.  Another situation.  Actually, Anthony was on the case with me on this one.  I had to call him immediately.  I had to do some research.  And I had to get him on IMDB to see what the hell was going on.  And the story goes like this.  It's a big week for me and my chick.  First, it was the paparazzi Daily News photo fiasco.  Fiasco.  Where she didn't want her picture taken.  She ran away.  And then they took a picture of her.  Fiasco.  I'm sure you heard us talking about that earlier in the week, right? 
[00:17:00]  Yeah.  Well, I was in the bank yesterday doing some banking.  And I had my tongue up this chick's ass.  Shut up, stupid.  Shut up.  So I'm doing some banking and it's taking a little time.  So I'm up near the tellers.  And Lindsay's in like the lobby area near the ATM machines just sitting on the windowsill  minding her own business.  Uh-huh.  And this big fat old slob of a guy walks up to her. 
[00:17:30]  I find out this after the fact, by the way.  Walks up to her and has a little conversation with her.  Hmm.  And gives him his phone number.  Oh.  Turns out he's like 61, 62 years old.  So I get back and she's got this look on her face.  I'm like, what?  What happened?  And she goes, this old gentleman that kind of looks like an older version of Michael Moore  approached me and said he was a Hollywood director. 
[00:18:00]  Ah, the Hollywood director.  Says he was a Hollywood director.  Uh-huh.  And Lindsay's like, I'm just sitting there minding my own business and I notice this guy  staring at me and he's really, really creeping me out.  So the guy comes up to her and they start talking.  And the guy, his opening line was, you mesmerize me. 
[00:18:30]  You mesmerize me.  You mesmerize me.  I was staring from across the way here and you've been mesmerizing me the whole time  I've been in the bank.  I'm a Hollywood director.  So she's a smart woman.  Jimmy knows that.  And she goes, is that what you say to pick up chicks?  Of course.  And he's like, no, I'm not a pervert.  I'm telling you, you know, there's something about you that is mesmerizing me.  I'm a writer and a director.  Uh-huh.  And I want you to see, you know, a couple of my films. 
[00:19:00]  And if you're interested, you know, I would like to write a part for you.  Well, are you working on a movie now?  Um, no.  But I would like to write a part for you.  I'm like, are you fucking kidding me?  Are you kidding me?  I can't even walk to the bank.  Did he ask her to email him at yellowtreats at AL.com?  Exactly.  I love this guy.  Jimmy Norton move that is. 
[00:19:30]  That old man.  You intrigue me.  That was the other thing he said.  You intrigue me and you mesmerize me.  Uh-huh.  So I'm like, great, what's his name?  So I get right on the cell phone and I go, Ant, look up this guy on IMDB.  What's his name?  James Toback.  James Toback was hitting on my chick yesterday at the bank.  James Toback.  And the entire country needs to know it.  And, uh, well, apparently he has written, produced. 
[00:20:00]  Oh, he's a real guy.  Directed a couple of movies.  But nothing really of note recently.  His biggest film was Bugsy.  Bugsy.  Which is pretty bad.  If you look at that.  He's got the writing credit on Bugsy, which starred Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Harvey  Keitel, Ben Kingsley, Elliot Gould, Joe Montaigne.  He does a lot of movies with, like, Robert Downey Jr.  Um, who else?  Harvey Keitel's been in a few of his films. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  So he's the real deal.  But I don't think what he was telling her is the real deal.  You know?  No.  So I, we, you know, we go home and, uh, we go to IMDB and I'm like, is that the guy?  And she goes, yeah.  So it's definitely him.  You know, giving her all the moves.  Yeah.  He was in, he directed a movie called Black and White, which I remember seeing, matter of  fact, because it starts out with one of the sickest scenes I've seen in recent, uh, recent  years in regular movies where this white chick is getting just slammed, just getting slammed 
[00:21:00]  by a black guy in the middle of, uh, Central Park in the woods.  I remember.  That's like the opening scene where it's pretty much just this white girl bent completely  over, holding onto a tree and the black guy's just railing her.  Yeah.  So I did a little more research on a lot of these movies.  Read off some of the titles, Anthony.  All right.  We have When Will I Be Loved?  Harvard Man.  When Will I Be Loved is the latest one, right? 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  That's the one he wants her to see.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  What is that movie about?  I bet it's about a younger woman who falls for an older man.  Something like that.  Uh, Nev Campbell is in it.  Right.  Nev Campbell was in this movie, 2004.  I did all my research yesterday.  Nev Campbell?  Nev Campbell gets topless in this movie.  Yeah, yeah.  She's, uh, it's like her first, uh, topless scene.  Right.  Has anyone seen a pattern here yet?  Uh, and Nev Campbell, I guess, got naked in this movie because her career was kind of, 
[00:22:00]  you know, waning and this, and so she really had no choice.  So she gets this, uh, she gets this project, but this guy says, hey, you know, I want you,  you know, topless in this movie.  So it was her first topless role.  So far, all you're doing is making me like this guy.  Fat old creep at the bank.  Gotta respect that.  He's also put, um, Sarah Michelle Gellar in a movie.  Right.  I guess that was Harvard Man. 
[00:22:30]  Well, he-  And wrote Harvard Man.  He mentioned Heather Graham.  Heather Graham in a movie.  And, uh, who is the other one?  Nev Campbell.  Viju Phillips.  Heather Graham.  I think we're seeing a pattern here.  Blonde and blue-eyed.  I'm gonna say the odds are it's bullshit, but-  Of course it is.  You never know, man.  Did he ask if she's an actress?  No, of course not.  Done any acting?  No, of course not.  Has an agent?  No.  Has headshot?  No.  Could be an oversight.  The guy is-  Well, you know, Jimmy is on the radio, but he uses that power to get girls. 
[00:23:00]  But I don't-  This guy is in the movies, but-  Yeah, he's-  But he's not even working on a movie.  Right.  There's nothing really going on there.  And read some of the synopsises-  Synopsies?  Synopsies.  Synopsies of some of these movies.  Uh-  And look at the ratings of a lot of these movies.  Let's see.  Half the movies he's done are NC-17.  Two girls and a guy?  Two girls, Carla and Lou, meet on the street outside a loft waiting for their boyfriends. 
[00:23:30]  In a short time, they find out they're waiting for the same guy.  Young actor Blake, who says that he loves only her to both of them, but was actually leading a double life.  Uh, I guess there's sex in that one.  That's the one with Heather Graham in it.  Right.  And then Love in Paris?  Is that one.  A group of boys from Preppy Private School from Louisiana visiting Paris for spring break. 
[00:24:00]  Uh, get separated from the group.  Along the way, they find a group of girls who have also been separated from the group.  Not only do they find them, but they also find love.  And by love, it's on-screen fucking.  Right.  Exactly.  So I go, uh, I go, Lindsay, you gotta call the guy.  Because, you know, the curiosity is, is, is, uh, was getting, uh, you know, both of us in a way.  So, uh, she has a little conversation with the guy and, and all he's saying is, 
[00:24:30]  you mesmerize me, you really intrigue me, you know, are you living in New York?  You know, uh, are you going to school or, you know, what's your deal?  And then he said something like, uh, uh, have you had a, uh, have you had an exciting life up to this point?  Oh, because now it's going to kick into high gear.  And then he's like, uh, are you open-minded?  Do you have an open mind?  And she's like, you know, she's really not answering the questions. 
[00:25:00]  And, and he goes, well, you know, see this film, the latest one from 2004,  and you'll understand what my films are about and what I try to do.  How about this one?  A billionaire businessman hires a man to influence a South American dictator.  He winds up having an affair with the billionaire's wife.  Hmm.  Right.  What's this one?  A billionaire radio host.  Meets a man in a bank.  He works, uh, you know, he works with real actors and actresses,  but there's also other people in these films that, you know, he wants to just kind of exploit. 
[00:25:30]  Well, did you think of me?  It's my, uh, my opinion here.  How about, well, why don't we have Ben call him and have an on-air chat?  Because if he is legitimate about that, um, he would come on and go, yeah, she's mesmerizing me.  Oh, she's your girlfriend?  She's great, dude.  I would love to put her.  You know what I mean?  If he's legitimate, um, it's possible he really does feel that way, and he wants to, you know,  because that stuff happens.  It's just rare.  He's worked with Keitel a few times.  Yeah, the majority of that stuff is crap, but you never know. 
[00:26:00]  Some of these directors, like, are kind of flakes, and they work that way.  They just see something, and they go, all right, and they just have a vibe about somebody.  So I wouldn't write it off completely, but it's probably crap.  Well, uh, Eric is really helping me this morning by going to Mr. Skin and getting, um, scenes from all his movies.  Yeah.  And every scene I've seen so far is some young girl getting laid.  Getting banged.  That's great, Eric.  Thank you.  Thank you for that scene on the log.  Here's the scene I was telling you about, I think, in Central Park.  There's some kind of threesome going on next to a tree. 
[00:26:30]  That's not the scene I saw.  If it's the same movie, I'm thinking black and white.  Bijou?  So I had to deal with that yesterday.  So I was like, oh, great.  Fantastic.  Are you open-minded?  Yeah.  He kept saying that a lot.  Are you open?  Open-minded.  Open-minded.  That means I have an idea to have you naked.  That's what I'm thinking.  Yeah.  That, you know, that doesn't make me happy at all.  Yeah, see, here's the scene.  The two chicks are, like, making out.  Here's an example of being open-minded.  Oh, yeah, here it is. 
[00:27:00]  Here's his version of open-minded.  Yeah, here's his vision for my chick, probably.  Black guys banging white chicks.  Yeah, great.  The two girls are having a huge lesbian scene in the middle of the woods,  and then there's two black guys there.  That's great.  There it is.  There's a threesome.  A black guy with two white chicks.  That's open-minded.  That's his vision of being open-minded.  Being fucking open-minded.  Oh, wow.  What?  It's a picture of Angelina Jolie going into Lee's art shop,  which is right down the street here.  Oh, really?  Yeah, that kid.  Yeah, that's right where we used to work. 
[00:27:30]  Summary of When Will I Be Loved?  Right off of Internet Movie Database.  And this is the one he wants her to see, right?  Yeah.  She picks up men on the street and has sex with them in her apartment.  That's the one he wanted her to see?  Yeah.  The guy's a creep.  Well, I say we get him on the horn.  The guy's a creep.  He really is a creep.  I think he's using, you know, his power that he's a Hollywood director  and he's worked with a lot of, you know, real actors and actresses.  And then I think this is what he does to try to pick up young girls. 
[00:28:00]  And this guy, Chris?  Young, innocent girls.  Chris, I've seen the one with Robert Downey Jr.  and a young Heather Graham.  Very explicit sex scene.  She actually reaches down and grabs his junk  and you see Downey completely sporting wood on screen.  How about that?  A lot of his movies are NC-17 with explicit sexual scenes.  Yep.  Every summer he has that in just about every movie.  I mean, Bugsy was a legitimate film, obviously.  All these other ones are kind of artsy and stuff. 
[00:28:30]  And then he also did The Pickup Artist.  You might remember that one from like 1987.  I mean, that goes way back.  Molly Ringwald and a few others were in that movie.  Everyone's asking me to say what his 1978 thriller was.  It's Fingers.  Great.  I am so...  And then somebody says he has a writing credit for Fingers.  You know, and she...  And she says she's there with her boyfriend 
[00:29:00]  and, you know, I'm doing some banking.  And the guy was still just going hard, you know?  Yeah.  I wish, I wish, I wish I came upon this.  I am so pissed off that he was gone  by the time I got back to the lobby.  That's his MO.  Well, that's...  Here's the thing, though.  You have the, uh...  You have his number.  Oh, yeah, I do.  So why don't you have Ben call him  and just see legitimately...  Honestly, I don't have it today.  I could probably get it.  Yeah, call him when we're going to break it.  Maybe later on in the show  we'll try to get him on the phone.  He might be real.  I mean, who knows?  He's a real director,  but I don't think his intentions are real. 
[00:29:30]  You're probably right,  but I see you give it a shot.  You never know.  Maybe he's looking for some other actors.  Jimmy's just going to try to work it.  Hi.  I'm open-minded.  Show my ass to...  My life hasn't been very exciting, sir,  but I'm very willing to be excited.  I think I can intrigue you, sir.  Yes.  I could be mesmerizing  and a little teddy for you.  Creep!  I say he's a creep! 
[00:30:00]  Older gentleman.  So...  Yeah, I would say, uh...  Oh, this guy seems...  There we go.  Brad in Chicago.  Brad, what's up?  You know, guys,  I can't remember the exact magazine  that I read...  This is another scene...  Hold on.  This is another scene  from one of his movies?  Wow.  Holy shit.  There you go.  That's open-minded.  There's his open-mindedness.  Wow.  What movie was that from?  That looked like, uh...  What was that?  Killing...  Heather Graham? 
[00:30:30]  That might not be  one of his movies, hopefully.  Sure it is.  Anyway, go ahead,  Brad, in Chicago.  Yeah.  This guy, Toback,  from what I recall  from a magazine article  that I can't exactly remember  where it is,  is a legendary  pervert and letch  and pickup artist.  And basically,  he has tried to make  his movie career  based on his  perverse lifestyle. 
[00:31:00]  All right.  So I would not trust him  as far as I could spit.  Okay, hold on, Sarah.  Let me read this.  It's in Salon.com,  Arts and Entertainment.  The original pickup artist.  At 57,  James Toback is clean,  sober, and married.  But the legendary  Hollywood womanizer  and gambler  still bets his life  on every new movie  and talks to strangers  in Central Park.  Exactly.  As we walk through  Central Park,  James Toback tells me  a true story  that sounds more like  a scene from a movie. 
[00:31:30]  It's about a pedophile  accused of sleeping  with boys  on the run from police  and $10,000 in debt  from a bookie.  It was just shown up  at the Toback's hotel room  door begging for the money.  You guys got like  a million of these  horrible stories.  True life,  not just movies.  Exactly.  Okay. 
[00:32:00]  Come over here,  he says.  I want to show you something.  This is an example  of how I get  a bad reputation.  With his hands  on my shoulders,  he focuses me  on a woman  with long blonde hair  who is reading  cross-legged on a blanket  in the middle  of the great lawn.  This is what I do,  he whispers  as he heads toward her.  I see this girl  and she looks like  she may be interesting.  And as I get  closer and closer,  I see if she still  holds my attention.  I see if there's  a gravitational pull  because if there isn't,  what's the fucking point?  But he walks past her, 
[00:32:30]  he pans his arm  from left to right  across the skyline  of trees  that surround  Central Park.  The shot  could be an  establishing scene.  He does this  all the time, dude.  All the time.  That's actually  better that you're  reading that he does  that though  as opposed to  having never done it  before.  Maybe it's something  he really does  to get people  for films.  But he walks  over to her,  says,  excuse me,  I wonder,  have you ever done 
[00:33:00]  or would be interested  in doing anything  cinematic?  And if you are,  would you be interested  in discussing it?  Squinting her eyes  in confusion  and blushing,  she asks what  he means.  My name's  James Tovac,  he smiles  and shakes her hand.  I'm a movie director.  Have you seen  Black and White?  This is exactly  how it went  down the bank.  Exactly.  Yesterday.  Go ahead.  Yeah, yeah,  talk about a pattern.  Definitely.  Are you a student?  He asks.  This is his M.O.,  dude.  Does this all the time. 
[00:33:30]  What do you do  with her?  Like this girl.  I'm, you know,  I'm screening  as I'm reading.  The girl has forgotten  that Tovac is a stranger.  He interrupts her  giggling and goings-on.  Talks about voting  for Clinton.  Check out my work,  he said.  That's exactly what he said.  If you see anything  you think you connect with  and might want to be  a part of  without promising anything,  call me.  The one-of-a-kind  opportunity smile  forms on her face. 
[00:34:00]  She hands him her flyer  and he writes  his number on it  and she thanks him.  We turn away  and he says,  I do that  15 times a week.  Well, okay,  maybe 50 times a week.  40 girls  and 10 guys.  The guy's getting  pussy out of this.  I'm sure he is,  but I also think  that he might  at times.  You never know.  I'm saying,  I wouldn't completely  write it off  because he is  a legitimate director  and he's admitting,  yeah,  this is something I do. 
[00:34:30]  It's not like  he's sneaking around  going,  oh,  I don't do that.  He's taking advantage  of what he does.  Probably.  I'd like to know  if he's met anybody  and put them  in a film like that.  All right.  Thank you, Brad.  All right.  I'm up.  Take care.  Yeah,  I read that too  last night  that he's a legendary  womanizer, Anthony.  Legendary womanizer.  Tobak never concealed  his behavior.  He flaunted it.  He even wrote  a book,  Jim,  an admittedly  self-centered biography  of football legend  Jim Brown  that chronicles 
[00:35:00]  Tobak's experience  as a Jewish white guy  who lived with Brown  in Hollywood,  elected essentially  a series of wild parties  and orgies.  Jim is making his rounds.  Jane Fonda is there  and Sharon Tate.  I drift into an old friend,  a delicate girl  of angled Nordic beauty,  and embark with her  on an orgy.  Jim joins.  This guy loves blondes  with blue eyes.  He likes watching  Jim Brown bang him.  Yuck.  Well,  we'll see if  Mr. Tobak 
[00:35:30]  will come on the show today.  Maybe he will.  But like I,  you know,  like you guys asked,  didn't ask if she had  an agent,  if she's ever been  an actress,  wanted to be an actress.  50 times a week.  Hey,  dude,  you're lucky  it was this guy  and not Brad Pitt  or somebody like that  because she would have  been like,  nah,  it's just this guy  I blew him off.  Lindsay,  why are you going  to California?  Nah,  just need some sun.  see Opie just  dragging her over  by the hair  to show her his  balance on the 
[00:36:00]  ATM.  You know,  I haven't eaten  dessert in years,  but I started  eating dessert  last night  and I'll be  eating dessert  every night  for the next  two years straight.  Why's that?  I just like dessert  all of a sudden.  Lots and lots  of ice cream  for everybody.  Oh,  is that what  you're going  to do?  Lots and lots  of chocolate mousse.  Not just you?  Not just me.  I love dessert.  He's going to be  one of those guys  that make his chick  desserts. 
[00:36:30]  Lots and lots  of whipped cream  for everybody.  I haven't touched  cake in years,  but man,  I think I like  dessert again.  Let's see.  Back in the basement.  I want to be  in motion pictures.  Yeah,  I mean,  I just saw  right through this guy.  Maybe the man  will like me too.  He said  10 guys.  I better get ready  to do some acting.  I better do some  phone acting.  I'm very good. 
[00:37:00]  That was my little  afternoon yesterday,  dealing with that.  Hey,  how's this?  This is pretty good  for a scene.  Sam,  we got to catch  the murderer!  That would be  like something  from Quincy.  Wonderful.  Chad from Brooklyn,  what's up?  What's up,  Obey?  Hey.  It seems a little  contradictory,  because the other  day you were pissed  off that a bunch  of message board  nobody sent your  girlfriend was ugly.  And now you're  pissed off that  a Hollywood director  is beautiful.  First of all,  it was just a  handful of idiots  that have no clue 
[00:37:30]  what they're talking  about.  95% of the people  that would see  Lindsay would say  she's hot.  I mean,  that's the reality  of it.  I was just pissed  off that people  were trying to see  something in a picture  that just wasn't  there.  It's just a funny  inconsistency.  He pointed out  because then he goes,  yeah,  but then a Hollywood  director says  she's beautiful  and you're angry.  Basically,  this gentleman  is saying  there's no winning.  Yeah,  well,  I guess you're  right in a way.  Yeah.  Sure.  Yeah,  don't let them  get you.  All right,  thank you,  sir.  No problem.  You never know,  Eric,  maybe this man  will be making 
[00:38:00]  a movie about  a boy who just  shoves mayonnaise  into his mouth  and he'll happen  upon you  and say that  you captivate him.  That's something  else I love now.  You disgust me.  I love mayonnaise.  Mayonnaise on  everything from now  on.  Lots and lots  of mayonnaise.  But it's ice cream.  Man,  mayo on it.  Here you go,  a nice ham sandwich  with a lot of mayonnaise.  A nice dollop of mayo  for everybody.  Dollop.  Buffalo chicken wings  for lunch and dinner  with lots and lots  of blue cheese. 
[00:38:30]  Lots of it.  In an interview  from Interview Magazine,  Toback claims he took  the most hits  of LSD ever recorded.  That's great.  He's just a winner.  An absolute winner  in Hollywood.  He knows Kytel.  Huh?  He knows Kytel.  Maybe he can introduce us.  Who the fuck cares?  I like Harvey.  As opposed to good?  That's good, right?  Let's say hi to Andy  in New Jersey.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Listen, I think what this guy  Kovac wanted to do  was bend your girl over  and say,  come on. 
[00:39:00]  Come on.  Very helpful, sir.  Yeah, thanks.  No problem, guys.  Hey, listen.  I mean, it's obvious, you know.  It's very obvious.  He gets real actresses  and actors.  I mean,  what does he want him for?  Come on.  Probably right.  Again,  I say that you're  probably right.  I would say  if he comes on the phone,  though,  maybe he's genuine.  I think he's just  a creep.  I think he likes blondes.  Blondes.  That's what I think.  Blondes with blue eyes.  Yeah. 
[00:39:30]  And I think  he likes meeting them  and seeing what goes on.  And that's his way  of doing it.  It's a great rap.  Maybe doing some test shots.  I know.  Oh, boy.  Maybe some test scenes.  All right.  Why don't you pull  the shoulder  of the top down  just a little bit.  That's great.  That's great.  Take your thumb,  put it in your mouth  like a little girl.  What?  You don't know  topless?  Yeah, man.  Coco.  Stupid Coco. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, candy corn tits.  Oh, those awful tits.  Yeah.  They look like  rotted  photo negatives  of candy corns.  Oh, God.  It was just  really, really,  really annoying.  Yeah.  Lucky it wasn't Spielberg.  Huh?  Remember it was Spielberg  being a creep like that?  Mm-hmm.  Hi.  You ever think  of doing movies?  Yes.  What are you doing here?  Nothing.  That's a sure thing  right there.  I didn't think  that was going on anymore. 
[00:40:30]  I mean,  back in the day,  like a lot of these  Hollywood stars,  you know,  that's how they were  discovered.  They're in the old  soda shop.  Cary Grant  was discovered  as a soda jerk.  Right.  They're sipping on a...  Clark Abel  works at Woolworth's.  Right, exactly.  And the director  discovers them.  Yeah.  That doesn't happen  anymore.  Yeah.  That doesn't happen  anymore.  Here's Gregory Peck  who is an usher  in a movie theater. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  In the bank.  That's how it works.  Eric Nagel  was eating lard  with his bare hands.  He pops the cocoa scene  up on the computer.  Ugh.  So I'm going to be  keeping an eye  on Mr. Toback.  Yeah.  Mr. Toback,  the creep,  in my honest opinion.  I understand that  Ben was approached.  He's not even  working on a movie.  Well, he could be  thinking about one.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  That's great.  Ben was approached. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah.  He was kind of embarrassed.  The guy walked up,  he worked for CGI  and he wanted to know  if he could use  Ben's cock  as a sea serpent  in a film  that he's writing.  The creature  from the deep blue jeans.  That's the sound  the creature makes  before it strikes.  Blah!  Digger Dog 
[00:42:00]  saying this guy  sounds like a real creep.  He'd be perfect  for the show.  Yeah, obviously.  We'll have to talk  to him later.  Yeah.  We'll see if he's  willing to talk.  If it's legit,  obviously he would  talk about it, right?  Yeah.  Oh, God.  That just annoyed  the piss out of me  yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Let's say hi to Chris.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, Hope,  I was wondering,  you know,  if your chick did 
[00:42:30]  a movie with this guy,  wouldn't it be  kiddie porn?  Jim on Long Island.  What's up, Jim?  Yeah, I hope.  I just want to tell you  you sound like  a whiny little bitch.  If this was  anybody else's chick,  you'd be giving  the guy props  for the good moves  he has there.  No, I wouldn't.  If you know  my role in the show,  I certainly would not,  you asshole.  Wait, wait, wait.  This guy's saying  you'd be giving  the guy props 
[00:43:00]  for his moves,  and that's true,  but, dude,  when it's your chick,  you don't give  the guy props  that's trying  to move in on her.  You give the props  to the guy  going after the chick  that you have  no clue who it is.  And I haven't been  the guy on the show  that gives props  to people that do that,  you ass.  Listen a little closer.  You know,  if your chick  is being hit on  by some Hollywood director  that has no intention  of doing anything,  you know,  legit or classy  with your chick,  I think you'd be 
[00:43:30]  pissed off.  I don't think so.  And if you did  a little research  and you see  that, you know,  every single one  of his movies  has explicit  sexual scenes,  you know,  you could do the math  and it wouldn't  make you happy.  So if you want  to call me  a whiny bitch,  that's fine,  but, you know,  you're insane.  Okay.  All right, Opie.  Insane indeed.  Maybe this is  a real opportunity  for her.  Let's go to Len.  Len, go ahead.  Hi, Opie.  You know,  I can understand 
[00:44:00]  how upset you are  about the whole thing  and I would be too.  But, you know,  I mean,  what about Lindsay?  If this is a real  opportunity,  I mean,  this could be  something golden  for her.  I mean,  you could always  go with her  to, you know,  any appointment  that she had  or something like that.  She's obviously  beautiful  and she obviously  competes with any  actress out there  as far as looks go.  And, you know,  I mean,  who knows?  You could always  go with her.  If it was like,  you know,  another type of  director,  then sure.  But it's obvious  what's going on here.  We just gave you  all the info.  You know,  he does work 
[00:44:30]  with legitimate  actors and actresses.  You know,  they have the acting chops.  He didn't even ask her  if she's ever acted.  So obviously,  he's just into her beauty  and exploiting that  in some way  in some scene  in a possible movie  somewhere down the road.  That pisses me off.  At least he's worked  with good-looking people.  The last girl  I was dating,  the guy walked up  and asked her  if she'd ever done movies.  We looked him up.  He had directed Mask.  No?  That's kind of good. 
[00:45:00]  You know,  I mean,  every single,  not every,  but most of his movies  are NC-17  with, you know,  explicit sexual material  or scenes  or whatever they call it.  Yeah,  but I'm just saying,  I mean,  what if?  I mean,  if you're there,  I mean,  obviously nothing's  going to happen  if you're there.  I mean,  it might be worth  the opportunity  or maybe even good  for a laugh  if the guy is  a real asshole.  Right.  Well,  she is trying to figure out  her next move,  but,  you know.  Cool.  Well,  good luck.  I guess we'll have to wait  for other offers  from other Hollywood directors.  Jesus.  There you go. 
[00:45:30]  Maybe she could be  the spokesgirl  for North Shore Animal League.  Do you see my point,  Anthony?  Am I being whiny?  No,  I see the point.  I absolutely see the point.  I think every guy out there  would be pissed off  under the exact same circumstances.  It's flattering.  I don't know so much 
[00:46:00]  about pissed off  because the guy's a guy.  I just think I know  what the guy does.  I think I know  his intentions,  you know?  Yeah.  Of course he makes movies,  of course,  but he also uses  that power to...  Yes.  ...to titillate himself.  Of course.  To what?  Titillate.  I wouldn't be mad  if the guy was respectful.  I mean,  if a guy's a scumbag  right in front of you,  but if a guy sees a hot girl  and just talks to her,  that's not awful.  He gave her his numbers  like he harassed her.  I don't think  I'm far-fetched on this one.  I think a lot of the guys  listening out there  would be annoyed by this. 
[00:46:30]  As long as the guy's respectful,  it's not bad.  Remember years ago  when you were at a restaurant  with your girlfriend  at the time  and you got up  to go to the bathroom  and some guy  at another table  got up  and gave her  his phone number  and started talking to her?  What a scumbag.  Now that's a scumbag.  Waits for Ovi  to get up  and go to the bathroom.  Gives her the phone number  and then leaves  before Ovi gets  to come back out.  Anthony had a classic line  yesterday  because I was annoyed 
[00:47:00]  so I called Anthony  which I go right to Ant  and he goes,  dude,  you just have to start  going out with ugly girls.  You have to just start  going out with ugly girls.  There's two solutions.  Get an ugly chick.  Don't leave the house.  Lock the doors.  Or get a vat of acid.  Yeah.  Throw some acid at her.  That's why she'll  always look surprised. 
[00:47:30]  That no eyelid thing.  That ice skin burns off.  You can just comfort her.  Put your arm around her shoulder.  Put burn salve on her.  It's all right.  It's just been  a very strange week.  What's a...  Oh.  There's a...  Yeah.  A new person  I haven't seen in here.  All right.  We should take a break.  Wait.  Did someone...  Did you attempt  to bring in this  outside party  into this situation? 
[00:48:00]  Hulk.  Jimmy,  so what's your...  What's your take  on this whole thing?  Um.  Again,  I think you're probably right.  I really do.  I mean,  it's...  I'm a guy,  especially the guy  who has a history  of doing that.  But because he has  a history of doing that  in a way,  he says,  well,  you could be wrong too.  It's a possibility  that he could be a pervert  but he could also have  a, you know...  He's going to just  throw her in a movie.  Probably not,  but it's not unheard of.  It doesn't involve  a nude scene.  It doesn't involve  some kind of lesbian scene. 
[00:48:30]  Maybe that's why  she's open-minded.  Yeah,  that's exactly  what he kept saying.  Are you open?  Are you an open person?  Are you open  to possibilities?  Yeah.  Well,  he's a creep.  Open equals lesbianism.  Yeah.  All right,  we should take a break,  get into some show.  I just got to say  one thing I read here.  The education panel  is probing the lessons  of slavery.  I just think  it's an interesting article.  Ooh.  You want to do that next?  Yeah.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen,  the one,  the only,  Sandy Kane. 
[00:49:00]  Thank you very much.  Thank you.  Yeah,  yeah,  yeah,  yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, 
[00:49:30]  joining Sandy Kane,  Mr. James Brown.  Help him. 
[00:50:00]  .  Come on.  Come on.  Oh, I'm cute.  Oh, I'm cute.  Oh, I'm cute.  And I'm playing.  And I'm playing.  Sit in the cage.  Sit in the cage.  Oh, oh, oh, sit in the cage. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, hey.  Oh, hey, hey.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, ow.  I'm, hey, I don't know.  I'm, hey, I don't know.  What the fuck?  Drink a six-pack, turn off the lights, smoke some crack.  I'm beautiful.  You're a filthy whore.  Opie and Anthony, XM202. 
[00:51:00]  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  So I guess the priest quit, huh, Anthony?  That's been a big story the last few days here in New York City.  I guess it's made national news.  It had to, right?  Yeah, they love it.  The beauty and the priest.  The story goes, the priest and his secretary go out to the Hamptons, and they were tired 
[00:51:30]  and didn't want to drive back to the city, so they went to an hourly motel for, what, four  or five hours?  Yep.  And came out with their clothes changed, and yeah, the husband of this woman, they're going  through a divorce, so he sent a private dick after him with a camera and videotaped him  going into this hotel, and I guess there'd been some hanky-panky going on, some allegations  made from the woman's daughter who saw some things going on in hot tubs, and this woman 
[00:52:00]  sitting on his lap with his shirt off, her in a teddy or something.  So, I mean, nobody's believing his story, that this is just a fatherly type of relationship  he has with her.  But yeah, St. Pat's, uh, I thought, oh, okay, we are talking about St. Pat's, I thought we  were still talking about James Toback.  Oh, no, St. Pat's.  Jesus Christ.  Can we get off that?  A priest came up, would you like to be my secretary?  Right, exactly.  Don't intrigue me.  Have you ever typed? 
[00:52:30]  Well, uh, rumor has it, I heard this, it's, uh, the higher-ups there at St. Pat's, not  like the ultimate higher-up.  Aww.  Yeah, no, the guys, you know, the human ones.  They said, uh, you're supposed to fire the secretary.  They went to him and said, fire your secretary.  And he said no, and retired, or, uh, resigned instead.  That's the advice these assholes gave him?  Tuck it away.  Sweep it into the closet, make it go away.  Fire her? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  Fire her.  He's a Monsignor banging a subordinate.  Yeah.  Fire her.  Fire her.  You gotta love their ignorance.  And he would have fired her if he didn't think he could still get some, uh, some, uh,  ass.  Yeah.  You gotta think.  You know, fast.  The guy's not gonna throw his whole career away.  He's protecting the ass.  Dude, he's 80.  Right.  He doesn't have much career left.  This is the best it's gonna get for him, and he's thinking, alright, well, I could continue  this relationship.  Who cares about the God thing?  I got a, I got a nice piece of ass over here.  At 80, it probably, it's probably gonna take him a while to get another chick. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  You know?  This one he's got.  A lot of people are probably looking at him like he's doing the right thing, but no, he's  just thinking about, you know, ah, pooh, ah, pooh, ah, pooh, ah, pooh, ah, pooh, ah.  Yeah.  So, there you go.  Uh, anytime I see scandal at St. Pat's, though, it kind of gets me shaken up a little bit.  See it in the headlines.  I'm surprised they haven't mentioned, uh, this.  Yeah.  Usually they tie it into what we did.  Scandal.  Sex scandal.  Right. 
[00:54:00]  Which, by the way, uh, our Sex for Sam thing, this coming Monday?  Yeah.  The third anniversary.  Oh, I thought we were doing it again.  Yeah, right.  Scared the shit out of me.  Sex for Sam this coming Monday.  So, he stepped down.  It'll be interesting to see if the relationship continues.  Ooh.  Uh, yes there, Jimmy.  God damn, this Pamela Rogers is hot.  This blonde teacher who banged a 13-year-old?  Yeah, she got smoking, man.  She got sentenced, right?  Yeah, nine months.  Is she the Christina Applegate lookalike?  Yeah.  Yeah, she got nine months. 
[00:54:30]  Wow.  This article's bullshit, by the way.  I apologized before.  What?  Oh, yeah, you teased some article going into break.  My era.  Education panel to probe the lessons of slavery.  But it's all things about, like, you know, don't schools already teach lessons on slavery?  Yes, they do.  Should they talk about slavery?  I thought it was more, it was tips on breathing.  Oh, my God.  What is wrong with you?  I am not.  What's wrong with me?  I don't know.  What the hell's wrong with you?  Awful.  It's an education panel to probe lessons of slavery. 
[00:55:00]  You're going to say stuff like that, and then you're going to skip off to Hollywood,  and we're going to be left here to clean up the mess.  Yeah, mister.  The mess you left.  What mess?  You can't just say stuff like that.  You certainly can.  When there's no one in the room that might object.  I believe this is some uppity group that doesn't think that the teachings of slavery are being  done properly in the schools.  They want to teach a little more than just slavery.  They want to show how slaves played a huge role in creating modern America. 
[00:55:30]  And what they want to do is appoint a council to teach.  And it doesn't matter.  The officials are not to be chosen based on their academic background.  Why would you?  But with due regard to broad geographic representation and ethnic diversity.  So they'd rather, instead of having competent teachers in there teaching this, they'd rather have people of color that can, you know, pass along their own agenda. 
[00:56:00]  Diversity.  Diversity.  Diversity.  Diversity.  Diversity is so fucking overrated.  Ethnic diversity.  Ugh!  Criminal.  That's what I say.  People of ethnic diversity.  Just say what you mean.  Right.  You don't mean ethnic diversity.  That means what?  Some Italian guy's going to come in?  Yeah.  Teach slavery?  But if he didn't do the shit he was supposed to do, he'd get fucking hit!  You gotta do it!  Get in the hay!  Fucking E-wack! 
[00:56:30]  Exactly.  Hey, we're going to talk a little about slavery today, children.  Don't you know?  They don't mean ethnically diverse.  They were forced to do things, and while my people were not at all involved in the trade.  The Americans were trying to tie that together.  Of course.  The Jews did it.  Of course they did.  Yeah.  They had their own difficulties going on.  Yeah, plenty of Jews here, you know, 1410, whenever that happened.  What the fuck are you talking about?  All right.  Have you guys ever heard Boo Got Shot? 
[00:57:00]  No.  The audio Boo Got Shot?  No.  Well, we gotta lead up to Boo Got Shot.  You gotta play the first clip, Anthony.  From that lady, if you still have it.  Lady?  Yes.  Yeah.  Remember this clip we played?  I seen the cops knocking the truck window out, and I thought they was giving the man UPS.  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  Yeah.  You gotta give people the UPS.  Of course.  You gotta give the people the UPS.  Oh, that was the God. 
[00:57:30]  The UPS.  All right.  But you've never heard Boo Got Shot?  Oh, it's a Dutchie I meant.  Oh, man.  I love when black people talk about crime.  When they are on the news.  See, we all had a pause.  We're in the middle of a nice thought.  A little nugget came out.  We're about to rock and roll with this program.  You're bringing it through the cloud.  You can keep going.  You don't bring my apple thing through Jimmy's fart cloud.  Just enjoy it.  Have a piece of that apple fritter. 
[00:58:00]  Now it's a rotten apple.  Oh, cut it out.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Yes.  So, no, I just love when black people talk about being eyewitnesses to crime.  Yes.  It just...  Usually involves a mirror.  It's just amazing.  Oh, Jesus.  What is wrong with you?  It was a good one.  It wasn't at all.  When are you heading off to L.A.?  That's a good one.  Oh, God.  Every one of your farts stink.  I've never had...  There has never been one...  Not a one where you don't go,  Oh, that's a surprise. 
[00:58:30]  It didn't smell up the studio.  I did a little racial humor today.  Yeah, it's all cute.  Cute and nice.  Please.  It's very enjoyable.  Of course it is.  All right.  So, Boo Got Shot.  Yeah.  I love this personally when black folk are eyewitnesses to crimes.  Yeah.  And they have to go on the news and try to describe what they saw.  Well, the news loves exploiting this also.  Hence the clip you just played.  And I would love if you would play it again, Anthony.  I've seen the cops knocking the truck window out.  And I thought they was giving the man UPS. 
[00:59:00]  I thought the man was dead.  That's the way it was.  You just got to be rolling the camera on her going,  Oh, it's gold.  So, here's another example.  Boo Got Shot.  She was shaking real bad.  And then she said, Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, Boo Got Shot.  Boo Got Shot.  I said, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We just saw it.  My suicide called somebody up here.  She called my cousin, Punkin, just sailed up.  She called her.  And Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  And Chi-Chi, she had left out. 
[00:59:30]  And she went and got in her car.  She bailed out.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again,  when I heard the gunshot,  and I seen some boy had run in the building over it that way.  He ran in that building.  I seen that car that flew off.  And then I seen a long gun, a big old gun in the car.  Okay, terrific.  Hello, exactly.  That's Boo Got Shot.  Wow.  Boo Got Shot.  What the hell?  I think Pumpkin was involved. 
[01:00:00]  Did I hear her talking about Pumpkin?  I thought I heard Patches in there.  Patches?  I don't know.  And Pumpkin was involved, and then the car took off, and I heard Pint.  Boo Got Shot.  I heard Pint.  Yeah, I don't know what that was.  I actually understood almost all that.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's hard.  It's just, you know, just the story about some guy getting shot.  Well, we got the translation for everybody.  Boo Got Shot, the translation.  Uh-huh, she was shaking real bad.  It appears the young lady was trembling from nervousness.  Pigeons, they got shot, they got shot.  Someone has been wounded. 
[01:00:30]  I said, who, who?  I inquired as to who the victim was.  She said, Boo got shot.  Boo has suffered a gunshot.  Boo got shot.  Boo has become the victim of another violent crime.  I said, oh my God, oh my God.  Oh me, oh my.  We just saw it.  My sister had called somebody or a pen.  My sibling telephoned another relative.  She called my cousin Pumpkin to sell dust.  In fact, it was my cousin Pumpkin who lives in this very same community.  She called her, and Pumpkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  Pumpkin was already on the phone with the local authorities. 
[01:01:00]  And Chi-Chi, she had left out.  Chi-Chi had already departed.  She went and got in her car, she bailed out.  She found her vehicle and put it in reverse.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again.  As she was departing, a shot rang out, piercing the cold night air.  And when I heard the gunshot, and I seen some boy had run in the building over that way.  Apparently, the perpetrator was seeking cover behind a local building.  He ran in that building.  It was that building over there. 
[01:01:30]  And I seen that car just flew off.  I saw the car depart with a rapid acceleration.  And then I seen a long gun.  I saw a firearm of substantial caliber.  A big old gun.  I mean substantial caliber.  The boy was in the backseat, he had a big old long gun.  In fact, it was the gentleman in the backseat who had the firearm with the extended barrel.  And there you have it.  The translation of Boo got shot.  Now I understand.  I didn't know she was saying building. 
[01:02:00]  I had no clue.  No clue.  No clue.  No clue.  I don't know what that was.  Far.  Far.  So.  Ah.  Man.  And now there's a new one, actually.  Yeah.  We collect these.  Yes, we do.  It's a fine collection.  That we're allowed to collect these days.  On 1010 Winds this morning, they had a story about a black guy.  Mm-hmm.  Black guy doesn't call cops for a rape and murder.  Yeah.  Why not?  You're busy. 
[01:02:30]  I'm sure.  Listen to this guy.  If I can cue this up.  Here we go.  A violent death for a 30-year-old woman in an East New York apartment building.  Police are still searching for her killer.  His third floor window overlooks the space between his building, 745 Blake Avenue, and the next.  Below, in the dark, he heard the attack.  A woman struggling.  It wasn't like a normal argument between like a couple arguing with one another.  It was a woman struggling, fighting someone off. 
[01:03:00]  Waddell Parks and his wife didn't call police because he couldn't see anything.  The next morning, the trail of blood led down a hall through the courtyard and under the first floor steps.  A woman beaten, raped, and murdered with a belt around her neck.  It was horrible.  It was like this woman was fighting for her life, you know, and I feel bad that we didn't call anybody.  Al Jones, 10-10 wins in East New York.  Good fucking job.  Bravo.  Good job, sir.  It didn't sound like an ordinary fight. 
[01:03:30]  So he's saying, even if there's arguments in the building all the time, which I'm certain there are, he didn't call the cops.  But he said this was something that didn't sound like a normal argument.  He could hear her fighting for her life.  Did he call the cops?  I didn't see nothing.  I didn't see nothing.  Unbelievable.  You think there's a lot of fights in that building?  All the time.  I know there was recently a big argument about the Google stock and a couple of other things with that ilk.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  Yo, that's my Wall Street's journal.  Boo got shot.  Boo got shot.  All right.  As we're on the news clip thing, this is one we forgot to play yesterday.  John Montone, one of our faves.  John Montone.  This guy is, uh...  How do you describe John Montone?  Well, his voice gives it away.  He's monotone.  He's monotone and just very dramatic about the dumbest stories.  Yeah.  When it gets really warm out, he goes to Coney Island and talks to people, you know, eating ice cream. 
[01:04:30]  And he always adds in some stupid little thing.  Like, here at Coney Island, on the boardwalk, where this walk is anything but bored.  Like, you try to put something together and it rarely works.  He's a classic, though.  Hokey.  Here's John Montone's story from yesterday.  That we didn't get to.  Judy, middle-aged but still athletic-looking.  Kenny tells me he can eat all the French fries full of trans fat he wants. 
[01:05:00]  Because he has the right body chemistry.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  Explain that to me.  What I mean by that, if you have big bones, you know, if you're going to get fat, it's going to get fat anyway.  So I've been eating for a long time.  Never get fat.  Look at me.  Right.  But it could be clogging up your arteries.  That might be a fact.  That might be a fact.  That might be a fact, but I never thought about it.  You've got to think about it now.  Sure.  And Kenny is now thinking about it. 
[01:05:30]  One French fry at a time.  John Montone, 10-10 wins at the McDonald's.  John Montone.  Well, that's every story he does is exactly like that.  See, he has to do the human interest type stories for the most part, and he's running out of stuff to talk about.  They send him everywhere.  He's outside a McDonald's or something?  Yeah, there's something about the trans fatty acids and the oil that they're using.  They want the fast food industry to change their oils or something.  Yeah, they're using an oil that costs $2 as opposed to using good oil, which would cost $5 for a certain amount, for the same amount. 
[01:06:00]  And it's bad for you.  But who doesn't know that?  McDonald's French fries are bad for you.  Is he really informing anybody of anything they don't know already?  Stop.  And he's got to go.  They send him.  John, all right, we've got the story of the day for you.  You're going to be hanging out in front of McDonald's.  Talk to people about the French fries.  Get them eating it.  Comment on how it's bad for them.  Okay.  I'll be shooting myself before I leave today. 
[01:06:30]  Hey, the human interest story.  They send him all over the city, though.  He's like the street guy.  Yeah.  The New York City street guy.  Yeah.  No matter what's happening, he's never there.  Like, during 9-11, I'm sure he was somewhere else doing some awful story.  About potholes or something.  Pothole repairs.  Where's a cop when you need him today?  Hey, when there's a pothole here that needs a barricade put up in front of it.  I'm John Montone. 
[01:07:00]  All right.  As we move on, this is a bunch of stuff left over from yesterday.  Leftovers.  Did you hear about the redheads?  The redhead thing?  Oh, yeah.  I did read something about that.  They don't feel pain as much?  Yes, exactly.  Is that true?  Well, here's the story.  Redheaded women appear to tolerate pain better than the rest of us.  It's true.  Scientists now trying to unravel this medical mystery.  After scientists in Canada discovered a pain-reducing gene in red-headed mice, 
[01:07:30]  researchers in Scotland are now set to launch a full-blown study involving humans  to confirm their theory that people with red hair, women in particular,  experience pain differently than blondes and brunettes.  We're just running out of shit to discover, man.  That's what it comes down to.  There was a time, man, it was like the wild, wild west,  and going back to Columbus and all that.  There was plenty of fun stuff to discover.  Things to discover.  Now they're just running out of shit to discover. 
[01:08:00]  That is a really useless fact.  They're trying to say that red-headed women don't feel pain as much.  As much.  Holy crap.  How could that...  Why would that be?  What's the difference?  Well, they don't say guys, though?  No.  No?  Which is strange.  They said in women in particular.  So then the story continues.  Listen to this.  So, in the interest of science, we took to the streets of New York  to test the theory firsthand.  That's what I'm thinking, right?  Punch a redhead in the face.  That's why I wanted to stop there. 
[01:08:30]  I'm thinking they're going out to the streets to test this theory.  You've got to think they're going to have some kind of torture device.  Said test it.  Not ask people about it.  Did you slam a pin into their ass?  How funny would it be if it was just a taser?  Where's the taser audio?  We've got to play the taser audio now.  We're all over the place.  Yes.  But I got excited.  I'm like, they're going to test the theory.  This could be good, you know, some good audio.  Of course.  They don't?  No.  So, in the interest of science, we took to the streets of New York 
[01:09:00]  to test the theory firsthand.  Do you have a high pain threshold?  I think so.  Right about there, he should have hit her with the taser.  Just ask her a nice question and then, bam!  And then nail her.  Yeah?  Broken bones, broken gist, and I didn't cry.  Are you in the rodeo?  What are you doing?  You go into a bar fight with this one?  Oh, yeah.  I have two kids.  That's pain and off, right?  Wow. 
[01:09:30]  Another non-story by the news.  And that was on Good Morning America.  Yeah, it was a big story.  It was a big story yesterday.  And that's how they test the theory, by just asking people.  Asking people.  When you broke your arm or something, how much did it hurt?  Did it hurt?  I'm John Montone.  Awful story.  How funny, though, if they just hit him with the taser.  And people said they...  Right there in Times Square.  They discovered the trait in a red-headed mouse.  And people commenting they've never seen a red-headed mouse. 
[01:10:00]  No.  I haven't either.  Yeah, good point.  There just used to be a time where there was so much fun stuff to discover.  Oh, please.  Everyone getting in on it.  George Washington Carver with the peanut.  Right.  He discovered something.  Jonas Salk with that polio vaccine.  There were plenty of cool things to discover.  Now scientists are sitting there going,  you think this red-headed mouse is going to hurt if I tap him on the knee or something?  With a pin?  Like, stick a pin in his head? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, they're just bored in the labs.  They're like, what else could we do?  He doesn't seem to be in as much pain as this white mouse.  Right.  Let's write it.  Hit the news with it.  Yeah, they've just run out of stuff.  Red-headed freckled mouse.  How ugly.  Dirty Joe has something to add to this, unfortunately,  because we're going to try to move on.  Go ahead, Dirty Joe.  Yeah, I noticed that a lot of red-headed women have fucked up teeth.  Apparently, you just hit them and they barely even noticed.  That is your observation that most redheads have fucked up teeth? 
[01:11:00]  Oh, yeah.  There's very few with good teeth, but yeah.  Can anyone back up this guy?  I think he's thinking of this stereotypical from the South kind of, you know,  trailer trash, red-headed stepchild kind of thing.  Yeah.  We have them in Wyoming, too.  Oh, you do, do you?  All right, Dirty Joe.  Oh, yeah.  We were hoping to do 15 minutes on this topic, but you, no, I'm just kidding.  There's just nothing there.  That was a quickie.  This is our house cleaning. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah, pretty much.  In the Daily News today, it's a big day, Anthony.  Very big day.  Do you know what happened on this day in 1945?  1945.  Hmm.  Well, of course we know.  Anthony and Groucho went somewhere?  Yes.  Me, Groucho, Zeppo.  I hated when Zeppo came along.  Harpo was always busy.  Today?  Did you mesmerize Groucho? 
[01:12:00]  Did you mesmerize me?  Did he wheel up to you and say that, uh...  Yeah, he wanted to put me in movies.  Did you mesmerize him?  I was a little tater tot.  Did he want to know if you were open-minded?  If you were open to possibilities?  Groucho was drooling at the time.  He wasn't talking to anybody.  He was in a wheelchair.  He was a million years old.  That was a little kid.  Uh, really fast.  One of our regulars.  Sandy King, what's up, Sandy?  Hi, gorgeous.  How you doing?  I'm doing good.  I'm a redhead. 
[01:12:30]  I'm a redhead.  My collies match my cuffs.  You're really a redhead?  I'm a real redhead.  Oh, yeah.  Sandy, you have satellite radio?  Um, no, but I'm going to have it after.  I mean, you guys really kill me.  And I really, um, I'm definitely going to get XM satellite today.  I'm running over.  How did you pick this up?  Are you picking it up through your genital wart?  My genital...  Oh, Twato says hi.  Hi, Twato.  How did you know we were talking about this?  I think she was...  Oh, because I'm listening to you on the phone.  Yeah, I think she was just on hold for something else. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, if she was.  But anyway, listen, I wanted to ask you guys something.  That the Laugh Factory, Jamie Masada, I want you to do a show, and I just wanted...  You know, I just wanted if you would.  Tell Jamie I'm not happy with him.  You're not happy with Jamie?  I was in L.A., and I wanted to go to one of his clubs out there, or the club he runs out there,  and he never called me back until I was back in New York.  Well, he called me after you called him.  And then it was too late.  It was too late.  Was it when Dane was playing?  And I think it was Dane Cook.  Yeah. 
[01:13:30]  Believe me, they didn't need you in there.  Well, I had the line.  I passed by the club that night.  The line coming out and around the place was ridiculous.  Well, we know a lot of these, you know, comedy club owners,  and we do a lot of business for a lot of these guys,  and every once in a while, I'll call in a favor.  Hey, why not?  Because I love my comedy, and I was in L.A.,  and the fact is, Dane was playing the Laugh Factory,  and I called Jamie, because Jamie always says, you know,  whenever you're in L.A. and want to see a show, any show whatsoever, give me a call.  Except Dane.  So I didn't feel guilty about it, and I called him, 
[01:14:00]  and I didn't get a call back until, like, Monday.  And I did call his cell phone, and he tried to tell me,  because I didn't answer the phone.  He left a message saying, I didn't have my cell phone for a couple days.  Who walks around without their cell phone for a couple days?  When did this happen?  I think it was that it was Dane Cook, and they were packed beyond belief,  and he didn't want to deal with the hassle that it would be to get me in there.  Well, my manager also, when I was out there in L.A.,  called Jamie to see if I could get a couple of spots there. 
[01:14:30]  No call back.  Really?  He loves you, Jim.  Only Jim Norton.  Maybe he lost his cell phone in a pond or something for a while.  He said if it's on XM Satellite,  I think 42nd Street and 8th Avenue would be perfect for you guys.  Well, I wanted to do the improv in the Laugh Factory in L.A.,  definitely, when I was out there.  And my manager got no call back, so I was like, I kind of took the hint.  But why don't you do it now, though?  Because I'm in New York, stupid.  No, I'm just saying, Laugh Factory, 45th Avenue.  I know where it is.  Stop trying to plug.  You know, it's my old home, you know, at Show World. 
[01:15:00]  So I just thought it would be great for you guys.  Yeah, really?  Did you?  And all the people from Jersey can come and see you.  All right.  Well, we'll think about it, Sandy.  All right.  Everything else is good?  Do you have an email address?  Just what?  Has Phil Spector threatened you lately?  Phil Spector, he's having a hair problem.  He's a very hairy guy, by the way.  He's very, very down there.  He's very hairy also.  Did you have sex with Phil Spector?  Oh, definitely.  Yeah?  I had to suck his cock. 
[01:15:30]  I have gunpoint.  It's not funny, but...  It's hilarious.  This is hilarious.  And this is what Sandy Kane is saying, allegedly.  But you are part of that...  Allegedly?  You don't believe it?  I believe it.  I just want to protect my ass.  But you're part of that whole Phil Spector case, right?  Yes, I am.  I was...  In fact, I had a meeting out there last year with...  The Phil Spector story is classic, by the way.  You know, it was the chick from what?  The Fast Times or...  She was...  What movie was she in?  Yeah, she was in Fast Times at Ridgemont High. 
[01:16:00]  She was the wife of that teacher.  Remember the hot wife of the creepy...  Oh, that was her?  ...creepy teacher.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  What about...  She's dead?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's the one Phil Spector killed.  Oh, I didn't know that.  But...  She was smoking a joint at the end of the movie or something?  But he's...  Yeah, yeah.  He's saying that he didn't kill her, even though no one else was anywhere near the house.  It's just a very suspicious thing.  And where's that case at right now, Sandy?  Well, I spoke to the DA Sortino, Doug Sortino, recently. 
[01:16:30]  And he said by, say, January, he's going to trial.  And the thing is, right after he did it, he ran out.  He told the chauffeur, I think I killed somebody.  He told who that?  Huh?  Who did he tell that to?  Phil Spector ran out.  And after he did that, after he shot her, he said, oh, I think I killed somebody.  And then he fired...  Oh, the chauffeur?  Why would you fire the chauffeur?  You should give him a raise. 
[01:17:00]  Hope he keeps his mouth shut.  Right.  Yeah, well...  But who cares about that?  You were dragged into the case because you had some fun with Phil Spector back in the day,  right?  Well, I was working at the improvisation as a guitar player, and I'm a recording artist.  And I met him that night, and he said he's going to record me.  And, you know, I went with him into his chauffeur limousine, and he took me to a Central Park South gorgeous suite of rooms.  And then he pulled out a gun, and he said, you better suck my dick, you know. 
[01:17:30]  And I said, oh...  You know, no, before he pulled the gun out, he said, I want you to suck my cock.  I said, I don't do that.  And then he pulled the gun from under the bed, and he said, you better.  And I had to do it.  Did he have a big mule?  It was kind of medium and hairy.  The hair on his head, that's the way it is down there.  And that's what happened on this day in 1945, right?  Is that what you were getting at, Opie? 
[01:18:00]  Big balls.  Big balls, huh?  He had big balls, huh?  I think the balls were bigger than the dick.  Now, that's...  Yeah.  That must have been a tree, huh?  I don't remember too much, but at least I survived.  Messy hair, huge balls, hmm.  Huh?  Sounds like somebody around here.  So, I think...  I'm glad that I sucked his dick, because maybe he would have killed me.  He had a gun to my head.  He should have killed himself after you did it.  And was it a turn-on?  What?  Was it a turn-on?  Was he a turn-on?  Was it a turn-on that he's holding a gun saying, you know, blow me? 
[01:18:30]  You know...  Some girls get into some weird, kinky, you know, stuff.  Opie, um...  I'll tell you that, you know, I've been raped in my life.  I've been a traveling go-go dancer, and my...  You know, I accepted rides home, and after a man, you know, rapes you, there's a closeness about it.  You know, I was interviewed on Celebrity Justice, and the guy that interviewed me, he said there's a name for that. 
[01:19:00]  This is a giant cock.  Yeah?  What?  No, I'm just saying that, you know, there is a closeness after a man comes in your vagina.  Sandy, Sandy, what happened when a guy drove you home?  We missed that.  You said you were a go-go dancer.  Somebody drove you home.  What happened?  Yes, somebody.  I was working in New Jersey, in Passaic, New Jersey, and I'm waiting for a bus. 
[01:19:30]  And it was a cream-colored Volkswagen, a Latin guy.  And he says, Mere, see, come on, I'll give you a safe ride home.  And I said, I don't know if I should, you know.  And he's like, ah, come on, you know, Mere.  So it was 4 o'clock in the morning, and I just jumped into the Volkswagen.  He's driving me home.  He seems like a nice guy from Ecuador, Jose, you know.  And then he pulls off on his shoulder on New Jersey, I think it was a parkway or something.  And he says, fucky, sucky. 
[01:20:00]  I go, no, no.  He said, fucky, fucky, sucky, sucky.  And I said, no.  So he had his hands around my throat, you know.  And he's squeezing.  He says, fucky, sucky.  I go, see, see, I am your friend, you know.  And he, I'll tell you, most rapists have small dicks.  So he pulled his cock out the dick.  Yeah, right.  He got on top of me.  Like, there's a Volkswagen.  We're so close, you know.  And he gets on top of me, and he, you know, real fast, you know. 
[01:20:30]  So basically, you're saying that the guy kind of brutally raped you.  He raped me, yeah.  And I said, I am your friend.  I am your friend.  Of course, of course, you know.  And I can do what you want.  I am your friend.  Oh, did he tag you in the ass?  No, right in the twat.  Oh, wow.  That's wonderful.  That twat was O.C.  But, um. 
[01:21:00]  You know, you probably caught that from one of your awful escapades like this.  Not that this was your fault, but, you know.  Yes, it was.  She should have known not to get in.  You know what I am?  He said good instincts.  Why did you get into the Volkswagen of an Ecuadorian at four in the morning?  Well, because the week before, I had got a safe ride home from the same club in a Cadillac.  I said, well, the last guy.  Oh, yeah, because they're all similar.  Six chambers, one bullet.  Jesus.  You're pulling the trigger.  But every time I get home from Ecuador now, I get crazy.  And then he, you know, I, you know, looked at him. 
[01:21:30]  I said, you know, I was afraid for my life, you know.  And I said, oh, I hope he doesn't steal my go-go money.  You know, it was like $80.  But, you know, he didn't.  And he said, get out, get out.  Yeah, how do you throw those out?  I'm going to stop talking.  Hurt him or, you know, like push his buttons.  You know, rapists are weird people, man.  They go from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde.  We have audio from inside the Volkswagen.  It's in the hole!  Oh, that's terrible.  So how many times have guys done this to you?  About five times in my life. 
[01:22:00]  You've been raped five times.  Yeah, well, I hitchhiked to L.A. once and a truck driver, a truck driver with smelly feet,  got me in the back of his little thing there.  And I said, you know, he...  How did he get you in the back?  He got me in the back, man.  I was hitchhiking to L.A.  I didn't have the fare.  So I was, you know, and he was a nice guy, you know.  I mean, we had breakfast after in the morning.  And then I hitchhiked back to New York.  The guy raped you and then you had breakfast with him?  Did you have breakfast with your rapists? 
[01:22:30]  Really, you know, and he was a pretty nice guy, you know.  He raped you and you think he's a nice guy and you had breakfast with him.  What did you talk about at breakfast the next day?  Well, you know, what can I say?  It wasn't a...  I mean, it was weird when you're having sex with someone and it was like he was a young,  nice looking guy, you know what I mean?  But no, but...  Well, then how is it rape?  It sounds very consensual.  The Latin guy almost killed me.  This guy, he said, I don't know, it was a weird thing, man.  And he said, you know, better...  He said, I don't understand myself, you know. 
[01:23:00]  I'm a wild lady.  You're going to make a great witness, you know.  I hope they call you to the stand.  How the guy raped you, how did he rape you?  It's a weird thing, man.  Well, how did it happen?  It's good.  Yeah, we have pancakes after that.  Bah.  Nah.  He did.  But then I hitchhiked back to New York.  I said, let me out of here.  I'm not going to L.A.  Let me go.  And then I got...  Wait, how far did you get?  Ohio.  Ohio.  Jesus Christ.  Ohio.  She was getting raped on Route 80 all the way through Pennsylvania. 
[01:23:30]  That's nice.  Hitchhiked home, man.  What did you have for breakfast with the rapist?  You go to Denny's and have the face slam?  Oh, excuse me.  I don't remember, but it was...  You know, there is a closeness when a man sticks his dick in you and comes, and there  is a word for it.  Oh, that's Jimmy.  There's a closeness about it.  You know, even the Latin guy, I felt kind of close with him.  You are a sick broad.  You are a sick, twisted broad.  How do you develop Stockholm Syndrome while you're being raped in five minutes? 
[01:24:00]  She developed Ohio Syndrome.  Yes, that's where a guy fucking rapes you, and then you decide to have eggs, but you  only have them over easy for some silly reason.  Over easy.  Well, and they're...  They most...  Rapists have very small dicks.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  Sandy, why did you have breakfast with the guy?  Well, because...  Because you were hungry?  Let me tell you, I was at his mercy, man.  I'm in his fucking...  I have no money.  I'm in his truck, and we had sex, and he said, well, you got breakfast now? 
[01:24:30]  I said, yeah, okay.  His feet stunk?  Huh?  His feet stunk?  His feet.  I mean, he has a smelliest feet.  I'll never forget that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he's supposed to give me money, and he didn't.  Oh.  I hate to have her memories.  Right.  And my memories.  That's funny.  Wait a minute.  The guy offered you money for sex and didn't pay you, so that's why you're saying it was  rape?  Well, you know what happened?  I said, you know, after he...  I knew I was going to be...  He was going to rape me, you know?  How'd you know?  Go through this. 
[01:25:00]  He told me.  He said, you better, man.  You know, he said, yeah, I would like to smoke a joint.  You know, he smoked a...  I didn't really want to.  You smoked a joint, and he said, I'm going to fuck you?  No, after, he said, you know, he stopped the truck in the middle of, like, nowhere,  man, and the truck stopped.  No one's there.  He could have killed me, you know?  I mean...  And then he said, he just kind of grabbed you and took you to the back of the truck?  Yeah, he said, come on, we'll go in the back.  I go, no, no, yeah, yeah, I don't want to do that.  And he said, yeah, you're going. 
[01:25:30]  You're going, man, because there he was in the middle of nowhere in a truck stop, in  a truck.  I mean, you know, when you climb into someone's vehicle, like when Lana Clarkson went into  Phil Spector's house, that was his, you know?  And she, when he wanted to fuck her, which he probably did, she wouldn't, man, and she  probably said, your feet sank or something, your dick is too small, you're too old or  something.  He fucked her.  I mean, he took a gun out, and she, maybe she grabbed it, and it went off.  Maybe something like that. 
[01:26:00]  Because when he ran out and he said, oh, I think I killed somebody, it went off, finally.  He always, you know, pulled guns.  What a witness.  So, I mean, when you want, you know, when you're in someone else's domain, like when  I'm in your domain.  You can't handle the truth, man.  How embarrassing.  Something really wrong going on here today.  You know, you know how embarrassed Phil Spector's going to be?  If you are sitting there telling people that he made you suck his dick, do you understand  how shattered his credibility now is?  He'll just cop the plea. 
[01:26:30]  He's guilty.  I did it.  I ran through, I killed her.  Just keep that one off the stand.  The damn guy worked with the Beatles, and that's what he's got to deal with.  Dude, fucking Tina Turner, he produced that.  If you ever have a puppy.  Phil Spector, the wall of sound.  He invented the wall of sound, and he has to deal with this.  Yeah, he has to deal with this.  The man's a murderer.  The man is a fucking nut.  If you ever met him.  He produced the Beatles, I don't give a shit.  That's right, and a good song by Tina Turner. 
[01:27:00]  Tina Turner.  Tina Turner.  You're my baby if you suck my dick.  All right.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  No, what I'm saying is...  Thank you.  You're done saying what you had to say.  Thank you, Sandy Kane.  Call us back when you have some more rape stories.  Why don't you do the Laugh Factory with me?  If you keep trying to plug that, what day are you doing it?  No one cares.  No, I'm doing it with you.  No one cares.  I mean...  Shut up.  I'll do the Laugh Factory if the whole audience could be Ecuadorians.  Exactly.  Pull up in Volkswagens, all of them.  Right.  And you have to take a ride home from each one of them. 
[01:27:30]  You know, you have a Laugh Factory.  One bus filled with Ecuadorians and you.  Jesus Christ.  Well, you know, I mean, so help me, I'll rape you.  Then I'll do the Laugh Factory or the Chuckle House or whatever the hell it's called.  That's right.  All right, we got to go, Sandy Kane.  Sandy, if I would have gotten a call back in L.A., I'd be happy to help you plug, but  I was a little hurt that I never got a call back in Los Angeles when I needed to do spots  for the Tonight Show.  Well, do it for your fans.  Please.  My fans don't care.  They'll come see me at the cellar.  One hand washes the other. 
[01:28:00]  Yes, it does.  Shut up.  And also, the club I did last night for Cringe Humor, which I love those guys.  I was happy to do the show with them.  This is why...  Shut up.  Shut up.  They love you at the comedy.  This is why the cellar is a great club, and this is why the stress factor, this is why  you do these clubs.  You do the...  Shut the fuck up.  Holy shit.  Holy, man.  Jimmy, please make your point.  I can't help you.  I know you can't.  Just make your point, please, Jimmy. 
[01:28:30]  People force their addiction in your mouth to stop you from talking.  It's not even sexual.  Hey, Jim, you touch my dick.  You touch my dick.  Oh, I swear to God, I hope a drunk driver just runs over your voice box.  I don't want you to die.  I just want your voice box crushed.  All right.  Jimmy, make your point.  I am making my point, Sandy.  For the love of God, let me make it.  Please.  That I did the club last night, and the show was good, and I'm on next to last, and in 
[01:29:00]  the middle of the set, it's going great.  I'm improv-ing with Patrick, you know, about his stupid dirty foot fetish, and they fucking  dropped checks.  And it was like, could you at least...  I mean, look, the shows are always good.  They have good acts, but we plugged on the air.  I mean, at least, could you at least have the fucking courtesy to not drop the checks  in the middle of the act?  So I asked the girl at the end, like, why'd you do that?  The boss is just, well, you were the next to the last guy.  Okay, stupid.  Now you know why you're not getting plugged and why no one works your club. 
[01:29:30]  Yeah.  There you go.  That's when, you know, in the middle of the comic doing his act, the waitresses will  come by, give the tables their checks, and now everyone's going through their pockets  and talking to each other about giving up bills and not paying attention to the comic.  And know why?  Because these clubs are greedy.  They're fucking the worst.  Because they want to get all those people out so they can get the next show in and, you  know, so they can squeeze three shows a night sometimes.  Stand Up New York does...  I don't even want to mention the name of the club.  No.  I don't even want to mention the name of the club.  Stand Up New York does it where they'll have three acts, and then they do a check spot 
[01:30:00]  that the host will do.  Like a six-minute spot where the host goes up, and it's, you know, kind of, you're  taking it in the face.  Yeah, at least you know what you're up there for, though.  But then the last comedian has almost no checks to deal with.  Yeah.  And had they done that, but it's like, could you have the fucking courtesy after we plug  to...  And this is not about this cringe humor.  Those guys are great.  But could you fucking have the courtesy to not do that?  Dude, you're up on stage when the checks come?  Yeah, and it's fine.  No, you must have looked, though, and how do you...  I asked the waitress, why are you dropping checks? 
[01:30:30]  And I knew why she was dropping them, but I had to let the audience hear.  She said, well, I was told to.  I'm just doing my job, and she was just doing her job.  Yeah.  It wasn't her fault.  Oh, you acknowledged it from the stage, though.  Of course I did.  Yeah.  And I shortened the set.  It was like, sorry, I didn't mean to go so long.  Fucking dumb, dumb club.  That's why no one works there.  That's why.  Where is it?  Maybe the...  I'm not saying where it is.  It's irrelevant.  Take the check spot.  No one?  Ow.  No, but you should...  Well, all right.  Listen, I don't want to...  Jim Norton is a big star. 
[01:31:00]  I'm not...  It's not about that.  I'm not a star.  It's a courtesy when you plug someone on the air, which is for free.  At least just don't drop checks.  No, but they usually put the shitty comics at the end.  All right.  Marie.  Hey.  What's up, Marie?  Not much.  You know what?  Sandy's crazy.  Well, yeah.  Because I...  Well, I drive a truck for a living, and I've been from Wheeling, West Virginia, all the  way across to the Indiana border.  There is no secluded truck, Doc.  So, well, it's... 
[01:31:30]  Well, what...  Sandy, what year were you raped in the truck?  It was like, about, like, 15 years ago.  So, 30 years ago, this happened to her.  Yeah.  When she was 41.  Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.  No, hey.  Crazy.  You know, I'm...  All right.  Yeah, why?  So, what's the difference when it was?  It was a...  Because she's saying the rest areas are a certain way.  I'm saying maybe in the 70s, they were a little bit different.  They weren't as well-lit.  Of course they weren't.  She has too many of these type of stories. 
[01:32:00]  She's awful.  I think you have some kind of, like, rape fantasy thing that happens in your head, Sandy.  I think her lifestyle opens her up to being raped.  I agree.  Yeah, that's true.  But it is.  That, too.  All right, Sandy, we're going to let you go.  What's the big plug today?  You know, hey, listen to me on Opie and Anthony next time.  I come with Twaddle with a face on it.  I did Twaddle with a face, and I wear the Opie and Anthony G-string.  Okay, great.  Thank you.  All right, we're going to take a break.  How fucking great is she?  What do you want to plug? 
[01:32:30]  She plugs the Opie and Anthony show on the Opie and Anthony show.  You're as dumb as they come, Sandy.  That's zilch.  I've got to tell you, though, one of the best reality shows on TV  is that goddamn stupid crab fishing show.  I don't know how I got caught up in that thing.  What the hell was the crab fishing show?  Most Dangerous Catch.  Was that like by Lake Ichiguni? 
[01:33:00]  Was it going from Cleveland into Canada somewhere?  And it was a storm?  The Edmund Fitzgerald?  Well, our crab pots were full, and we came into shore.  I really like that song.  Jimmy was asking his questions.  That stupid Gordon Lightfoot.  This song goes on forever.  I love it, though.  And the water was at my ankles, and this song goes on another hour.  Is that the song that makes you just get all tingly, Jimmy?  I just like it, because I like the fact that he's doing a 40-minute ballad about... 
[01:33:30]  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  I looked at the fuel gauge.  It was three-quarters full.  And we motored on towards our destination.  And then we bought a Rolls-Royce on eBay.  Hey, we could kill seven minutes.  Let this play today.  Oh, my God.  I asked for my money back.  He said, drop dead, you horse-toothed, too.  You're getting nothing back.  And lives on from the Chippewa on down, and the big lake they call Kitchigumi.  Kitchigumi.  All right. 
[01:34:00]  The lake, it is said, never gives up for dead when the skies of November turn gloomy.  Gloomy.  Kitchigumi with gloomy.  With a load of iron ore, 26,000 tons more than the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty.  I smelt bad from fish and put on perfumey.  That good ship and true was a bone to be chewed when the gills of November came early.  They cast off yet?  We untied the bow line and untied the stern, and I started the engine with a turn of the key. 
[01:34:30]  Jesus.  Every friggin' step of the way of the Edmund Fitzgerald.  We get it already.  We get it.  You're on a boat.  I took a compass heading of 135, and I turned the wheel.  And the purser got me my coffee.  I take it light and sweet, but he made it too dark, and I sent them back to the galley.  All right.  What happened?  What happened next?  Could it be the north when they've been feeling? 
[01:35:00]  I went to sleep in my hand's sleep paralysis, and I woke up to the exorcist's face in my bed.  It's gone forever.  The wind and the wire made a tattletale sound.  What?  The song's only half over, and I still see the dock.  The wind and the wind and the wind and the wind and the wind and the wind and the wind and the wind.  I forgot my wallet in my car, so we turned the ship around, and we docked again, and I figured I'd stop for a beer. 
[01:35:30]  When afternoon came, it was freeze and rain.  Tune in, and two hours later, when the ship finally sinks.  Enough.  And then they're throwing a musical interlude to make it longer.  Christ.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading. 
[01:36:00]  I'm putting hands.  Just talking about Jimmy's feet.  I've had the ongoing right foot problem for a while now.  I've had pain in my right ankles, both of them.  Both of your right ankles.  I mean, well, the ankle on both sides of my right foot, whatever that is, and on the underside, too.  So I go to the podiatrist, and she was actually very good. 
[01:36:30]  I'm going to plug her.  She was terrific.  She didn't ask me to.  I didn't get a discount.  The worst last name ever, Dr. Horfour.  It's H-O-O-R-F-A-R.  Horfour.  She's on Park Avenue.  Oh, Park Avenue, doctor.  But she was great.  I walked in, and she had me walk in front of her.  Five seconds.  She's like, okay, the problem's with the right foot.  Because apparently I walk.  I have a duck walk.  My right foot flops out when I walk.  Oh, no.  Does it?  I walk like a chaplain. 
[01:37:00]  I didn't know.  She told me to walk five feet.  Can you see this?  This is how I would walk naturally.  It's a radio that can't.  Yeah, I'm walking.  I'm watching me walking.  Wow.  I didn't know I did that.  Your right foot is poking out.  I didn't know that.  I didn't know I did that.  Now, what do you do about something like that?  Oh, she told me I have to have arches made, like a fucking 90-year-old.  I should be a Monsignor at St. Pat's.  I have to say there's a position open.  You need arches made?  I have this medicated bandage on my foot for a week. 
[01:37:30]  And then I have to go back, and she's going to put another one on.  And, you know, she did like a little bit of sonar therapy or whatever it is.  Ultrasound.  Ultrasound.  Yeah.  She's great, though.  X-ray it or something?  Yeah, I took a quick X-ray.  Everything was right there.  There was no one else in the office but me, her, and the assistant.  She was phenomenal.  Hot.  Yeah.  And your foot.  Yeah.  And you're flat-footed?  Oh.  You need arches?  Yeah, my arches are collapsing or whatever.  She's like, it happens.  There's nothing you did.  The arches of an elephant.  She's falling down.  I'm like, well, why does my right side hurt?  She's like, because your feet are flattening out. 
[01:38:00]  Flattening out?  Oh, pancake feet.  I'm a Mad Magazine character.  God, I suck.  Just when you thought things were okay.  Bad sinuses, bad eyes, bad feet, and appendix scar.  Flat feet.  Line up, ladies.  Fucking idiots.  I think you never attempted to join the military, because they would have just thrown you out.  For one of 30 things.  Flat feet.  That's right.  Wow.  Well, good.  I hope they fixed that up for you with your arches.  What, are you going to have to put them in your shoes? 
[01:38:30]  I imagine I will.  I don't need this.  How fucking old am I?  This is horrid.  If I can finally do the exercise bike again, I'm so happy.  Oh.  You'll finally get a young lady back to your apartment, and you'll start disrobing, and  his arches will fall out of his shoes.  What are these?  My arches.  Put them in those.  The shoes with the lips.  All right.  Congrats.  You guys want to get Francine in here to do the news, or what? 
[01:39:00]  That's what she's here for.  Francine's a classic.  She's a classic.  She's a college graduate.  She graduated?  I believe so.  She was an intern for our show back on a regular radio.  And she also does some comedy on the side.  Yes.  She is one of the few women of color that we've had on the show.  Beautiful ebony princess.  Thank you, Anthony.  A little Nubian.  What does your shirt say?  I slept with Jim Norton, and all I got was this lousy... 
[01:39:30]  Virus.  Virus.  That's a great shirt.  And I didn't see that, by the way.  I didn't see the virus part on the internet, because I planned on wearing it in public.  What, did you have, like, your browser minimized and just saw, slept with Jim, got was this?  No, what I saw was, I slept with Jim Norton, so I was like, well, that's cool, I could wear that.  But then I had the virus part, and I was like, that's not cool. 
[01:40:00]  It's the coolest.  That's the greatest part of it.  That's the best part of the shirt.  That makes the shirt.  That lets everybody know that you're just kidding.  That's the whole joke.  I slept with Jim Norton.  A, I wish you would, and B, why would anybody advertise that?  The only time that's ever written down, it's in a suicide note.  Well, I didn't like that part.  But that's the whole thing.  You ever see those shirts?  You know, my parents went to Vegas, and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.  It's a lousy t-shirt, it's like the whole playoff.  Yeah, it's a playoff.  It's a playoff that. 
[01:40:30]  My parents went to Florida, and all I got was this lousy t-shirt.  That's what that's from.  Why did her eyes get big?  Because she just realized it.  She thought Rodney Dangerfield was driving a boat right toward her.  That's right.  Now you get it.  Yeah, now I get it.  So now it's funny.  That's very clever.  Thank you.  Oh, my God.  All right, Francie.  What have you been up to?  You graduated?  How long ago?  2003.  Oh, all right. 
[01:41:00]  Where to keep up, Ant?  What do I know?  I thought she was in junior high.  No, I work now.  Now you work.  That's right.  You've had a job for a while.  A travel agent?  No, I do.  I know nothing about you.  They call it office management, but it's more.  Office management?  Yeah.  What are you managing?  The phone.  Yeah.  Is that what you do?  You take phone calls.  Her job is to make sure it stays plugged in.  But I have learned to replace printer parts. 
[01:41:30]  You learned to replace printer parts.  Yeah.  She's looking around the room all proud.  Yeah.  And what does that entail?  Something will break?  A roller or something?  What could break in a printer?  Old style printer.  Rollers.  The Mimeo machine.  I believe the ink.  The ink can break.  That's it.  You're a real maven.  So then I have to order new ink. 
[01:42:00]  So I call these people up with a number, and I order it, and then it comes in, and then  I put it in.  You really ought to open your own business.  You have a working knowledge of printers.  I can't wait for your IPO.  It borders on obsession.  What could break on a printer?  Ink.  Ink.  God, hire her.  God, how great you are, Francine.  My boss loves me.  I'm sure he does.  He does.  And is he a white gentleman?  Yes, he is. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, the bosses are always white, aren't they?  Yep.  And what is he?  He's nice to you, I guess?  He's very, very nice to me.  That's good.  Is he inappropriately nice sometimes?  Yes, he is.  He'll talk to you in sexual ways sometimes?  Sometimes.  What, will he comment on maybe your ass or something?  Yeah, he'll comment on my shirt.  Yeah.  Who's that lucky Jim Norton?  Yeah.  Things like that.  Yeah, if he saw this, he'd be a little less shocked.  But he'll get to look at my chest.  He'll say, oh, now I get to look at your chest. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  Smooth lines that guy has.  He is good.  Does he direct films?  No, Jimmy, we don't direct films.  And have you ever gone out with him outside of work?  Yeah, I have.  And he keeps calling me his wife when we go out.  Really?  Yeah.  So all his friends stare at me.  Because they know he's married.  You do know you have a lotto ticket here as far as sexual harassment suit. 
[01:43:30]  You think so?  To get some cash.  Yeah, you could probably get very wealthy.  Yeah, but he doesn't touch me, so that's good.  No, you don't have to these days.  You just got to say inappropriate things.  Really?  Yeah.  Before you know it.  You guys.  I'm a little recorder in, Francine.  I'm not that kind of girl.  Wired for sound.  Well, he gives me lots of money, so.  Oh, that's good.  Does he give you extra money, even more than your paycheck?  He sure does.  Sure does.  He does?  Yep.  What does he do?  Just throw you cash?  Yep.  Like, out of nowhere.  Say, it's Monday.  You're at work.  He'll just come up and go, hey, Francine, here's 100. 
[01:44:00]  He'll say, oh, sorry I yelled at you.  Here's the money.  And I'm like, ooh.  How much?  Like, $100, $20, I don't care.  It's free money.  This guy is so gearing up.  He wants you really bad.  Have you ever fooled around with him?  No, no, no, no.  No kissing.  He's like almost 100.  He's really old.  Yeah, but I heard money, though.  My eyes lit up.  I'm like, aha, the key.  I can do that.  I got money.  Yeah.  He's like 100?  Yeah, he's like pushing 80, I think, or 70.  Are you kidding? 
[01:44:30]  He's 70-something.  Wow.  Yeah.  You probably remind him of the old days.  I could have had you shot.  Shemi, that was very not nice.  Well, it was from a movie.  Oh, it was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Create some kind of malata.  Mangold class of printer repairmen.  Both models will be destroyed.  The epson and the canon.  Or is that the same thing?  I don't know.  We'll have broken ink all over. 
[01:45:00]  And I will fix it.  Yes, you will.  Yes.  You're very talented.  You do that, he just throws you free money out of nowhere.  Yeah.  And you don't have to do anything.  But spend it.  Do you wear provocative outfits?  Do you wear like skirts and short skirts?  Well, he has...  I've never seen you in a skirt, I don't think.  Oh.  You wear skirts?  Because you usually just wear pants.  Well, what happened is the boss's daughter got uncomfortable last year when I first started  working there.  What is she, 60?  No, she's 30. 
[01:45:30]  30?  Yeah.  And she made me stop wearing all my short stuff.  Really?  But I used to.  Yeah, I used to wear like short skirts.  Because she knew the old man was getting turned on by...  And the old man was going to drop from a heart attack.  Yeah.  Yeah, I used to wear whatever I wanted.  She wanted her pops around a little longer.  Yeah, right?  You'll cut in on the inheritance.  Yeah, that's what he told me.  And I leave everything to my Ebony sweetheart in the office.  Yeah, he loves me.  Nothing.  One dollar to my daughter. 
[01:46:00]  Worthless.  Make her stop wearing skirts.  Yeah.  I don't know why I talk like this.  But she's on vacation now, so I've been wearing skirts for the week.  Ah, so she goes away and you go right back to the skirts.  Because you have to pay your rent.  And where do they...  Gotta pay the rent.  Where do your skirts are?  Are they short?  I got it.  Knee high, middle of the thigh, or just below the Brillo pad?  Well, I wear short stuff, so they're ridiculous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I like them.  Do you wear panties under the skirts, or sometimes you just don't wear panties? 
[01:46:30]  I always wear panties.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  Do you wear thongs?  If the pants are too tight and you can see my underwear print.  No, actually, wait.  No.  When the pants are too tight, I forget.  Sometimes I wear thongs.  She forgets.  It's like Keith Robinson would always say, she wears church-issued panties.  Big bloomers.  That's one of the greatest lines ever.  Big frilly bloomers.  Church-issued.  Have the panel in the front for support.  Just awful. 
[01:47:00]  Practical underpants.  Has he ever gotten a look up your skirt, maybe, and passing the desk, or is there a  way to see up your skirt when you're sitting at work?  Well, sometimes if the skirt's short enough, when you sit down, it rides up a little bit.  Yes, it does.  So when he comes by, he might look a little bit more.  Yeah.  You ever catch him with a rod?  I hope not.  I don't think so.  Yeah.  Well, it sounds like you have a great workout.  A lot of people want to know if you're working at St. Pat's Cathedral.  I'll say no. 
[01:47:30]  We had to go to a storage place and look at books.  He was tired.  We pulled into the motel.  Pulled into the motel.  What do they do?  You don't have to say where it is or anything, but what's the line of business?  Real estate.  Oh, it is real estate.  I knew it was some kind of real estate.  It's cool.  Chemistry wants to know, well, she loads toner.  Can she locate paper jams, too?  Yes, I can.  Oh.  Thank you.  Very talented.  I can pull the paper out.  You're definitely an expert.  Yeah.  All right.  You want to do the news?  You work at Century 18 Realty. 
[01:48:00]  You want Francine to do the news?  Yeah, put the skirt on.  Now, go load the printer.  He puts it on the floor on purpose.  Can I say something before we do the news?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I listen to the show all the time, and Anthony, I was on the train a while back, and I was  listening to the show, and you said that you should run when you feel like there are  suspicious people on the train.  Yes.  And there was a suspicious guy on the train, and he made me feel uncomfortable, and he's  walking towards me, so I ran. 
[01:48:30]  You ran away.  Yes, I did.  Very good.  And he kept looking at me in the next car.  Yeah.  When I buzzed for the conductor.  He's called the conductor.  You can't be for real.  You did?  So you ran out of the car.  Yep.  You ran to the next car.  Were you alone in the car with him?  I was alone, because I ride all the way into the Bronx, because that's where I work, and  sometimes I'm all by myself.  Real estate in the Bronx?  Jesus.  Yeah.  Must be a booming business.  Nice.  Wow. 
[01:49:00]  They had the vacations in Beirut thing.  Didn't work out for this guy.  Can I show you something on Baltic and Mediterranean?  That's great.  So you're alone in the car, and this guy was in there.  Was he a black guy?  Sure was.  He was.  And he looked, what, shiftless?  Shady?  What did he look?  He had a backpack on, and he sat down, and we were on opposite ends of the train.  Uh-huh.  So I sat, and I kept looking at him, like, he better not move. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  So he started walking towards me, so I started, I just bolted out of the seat, and I ran.  Yeah.  And then I got to the next car, and he kept walking towards me.  Were there any people in the next car?  No.  Oh, boy.  So I buzzed, buzzed, buzzed, because I was right next to the conductor train, and then  the conductor came out, and he was like, what's wrong?  And I was like, that guy, I think he's following me.  And what did the guy do?  He just sat down and just kept looking at me.  Yeah.  Ah, he just thought you were cute and wanted to, you know, try to pick you up.  Was he vandalizing things, like he kept going from seat to seat and pulling the paper 
[01:50:00]  out and punching holes in it and putting it back?  No, but he looked like he was up to no good.  He wasn't James Toback, was he, a famous Hollywood director?  Was he?  No.  He was just casting for a movie.  Did he say that you mesmerized him?  No.  She is so far from his type.  That's right.  That's right.  Bring me some lemonade, if you don't mind.  Thank you, Anthony, for the great advice.  No problem.  Aw.  Look, I might have saved her life. 
[01:50:30]  That's right.  All right.  That's fantastic.  Well, Francine's going to do the news for us today.  Yes.  You got your own stories, or did you have somebody type them up?  I type them up.  I like the way she writes them, because she throws in, like, almost little editorials  on the news.  Does comedy on the side, right?  Yeah.  You're not moving, are you?  Are you staying in New York?  Don't be a fag.  Stay in New York.  Where do you think you're going?  Where she wants to move from Manhattan to shitty Maryland.  Maryland?  Stop.  You're one in a million down there.  You can't leave this. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, but I could probably try to get my driver's license if I go there.  One of a million.  Sorry.  You want to get your driver's license?  Yeah.  That's the reason to move?  Well, it's an idea.  What?  You could get a license here.  They issue them in New York.  She's leaving to go get her driver's license.  This is not the island of Dr. Moreau.  This is Manhattan.  She's a classic.  You're allowed to get a license here.  Yeah, what's the logic?  You're going to go down to Maryland to get your driver's license to do what?  To drive.  Because it's easier to drive around there, too.  But once you drive here, you can drive anywhere. 
[01:51:30]  It's good to learn in New York.  I know, but I'm getting scared on the subway.  I get scared, too.  Really?  Jimmy has his own defense, though, when he gets scared.  Jimmy, you drive a car.  Like a skunk.  My little Skechers go up in the air.  Like a skunk and an octopus shoots ink out.  Horrible.  So you're afraid of the train.  But if you get a license, then you could drive.  Yeah, then I could finally drive.  So you don't have to take the train anymore. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  So you're just going to go down to Maryland to get your driver's license and drive around, huh?  Well, we have a house there, and I probably won't have to pay rent.  Who's we?  Your dad?  My mom has a house.  Oh, your mom.  Well, my dad has a house, too, but I could live by myself.  Well, it's not really her house.  She's just kind of working there.  Yeah.  Excuse me.  Oh, your mom?  That was not funny.  We own it.  Another mint julep, if you would please. 
[01:52:30]  Your parents own houses.  Of course they do.  My mom has a house.  Another mint julep.  That's going to be the best line of the day right there.  They called me Francine.  That's a funny name for an intern.  I was going to help you learn to drive.  You were?  Of course.  Jimmy would sit on Jimmy's lap. 
[01:53:00]  Daddy help you.  Drive around?  No, we'll set up some cones.  I'll put an egg on them.  And then the one who can stop before they hit the egg.  Holy crap.  Great idea.  Whoever actually stops better gets to hug dad last.  What was more fragile, the egg or dad?  It wasn't an egg.  It was actually a glass with helpful medicine in it.  I've got to give Ben's raw ass the credit for this. 
[01:53:30]  Let's let Ben's raw ass set this up.  Go ahead, Ben's raw ass.  Great idea you got.  Hey, yeah.  I wanted to know if you could play fool got shot and maybe Francine could interpret.  Oh, I don't know.  Francine really hasn't been brought up around a lot of ghetto people, right?  No.  No.  No, that's why you're so well-spoken.  Well, I think you're in.  You know?  You sound, can I say, if I may use a politically correct term, white. 
[01:54:00]  Well, if you say so.  But she's a very intelligent woman, and I think she could translate this for everybody.  You want to hear some audio and tell us what's going on here?  Sure.  That was very racially sensitive of Ann, by the way.  That was very diplomatic.  You know, you speak pretty good for, you know, well, you know who you are.  Sound almost white.  I mean, I'm glad you're here.  Jesus.  There you go, Ann.  All right.  I'll try.  Here's Boo Got Shot. 
[01:54:30]  Listen to this and tell us what's going on, okay?  I do have black friends.  Of course.  All right.  So then you're going to-  We all do.  You're halfway there.  Listen.  Uh-huh.  She was shaking real bad news.  Peaches, they got shot.  They got shot.  I said, who, who?  She said, Boo Got Shot.  Boo Got Shot.  I said, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  We just saw it.  My suicide called somebody.  Oh, Pam.  She called my cousin, Punkin.  Just sailed up.  She called her, and Punkin told her that she was on the phone with Pauline.  And Chichi, she had left out, and she went and got in her car, and she bailed out.  And when she left out, when I heard the gunshot again, when I heard the gunshot, and I seen 
[01:55:00]  some boy had run in the building over it that way.  He ran in that building.  I seen that car just flew off.  And then I seen a long gun, a big old gun in the car.  All right.  That's Boo Got Shot.  Yeah.  Okay.  So what did she tell the press that just happened in front of her?  That sounded like Chinese.  That was...  I got like two lines out of that. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah?  Boo Got Shot.  Boo Got Shot.  That's it?  That's it.  I don't know.  Anything else?  Can't tell what else happened?  Something about a building.  Oh, I didn't even get that part.  The cousin's name was Plankton, I think.  Or Plankton?  Plankton or something.  It's a weird name.  Pumpkin.  Pumpkin.  Pumpkin.  That's Pumpkin.  Plankton.  How would someone get the nickname Plankton?  I don't know.  I can understand getting pumpkin.  Maybe some guy with a big head.  Maybe a big head ate him. 
[01:56:00]  What?  Oh, Plankton.  Yo, Plankton was hooked up with Baleen.  That's incredible.  Yo, man, Barnacle got shot.  Barnacle.  So anything else on that?  That's it.  Boo Got Shot.  Boo Got Shot.  All right.  Well...  Yeah, in a building.  We thought it was worth a try, but... 
[01:56:30]  That is the worst homie nickname ever.  What?  Plankton.  I couldn't...  How do you know it was Pumpkin?  I couldn't tell.  Because of the translation.  Because it couldn't possibly be Plankton.  You never know.  They might...  Who knows?  Maybe there's...  Not one black guy called Plankton out there.  Maybe the gentleman doesn't know what it means.  You know, it could have happened.  Oh, boy.  Plankton.  All right.  Well, Francine's going to do the news.  Mike has an idea from Jersey before we get started.  Mike, go ahead.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Thanks for calling the program.  What's up?  What?  Shouldn't you put this bitch in the dunk tank before she starts? 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, we should.  No.  Why?  What's the dunk tank?  Well, it's like a glass room like they're in over there or...  Just being behind glass.  Basically, we're saying you're not really worthy to be in the main studio,  so we're going to throw you in another studio like Howard does,  and it's like a dunk tank.  Oh.  And then you do the news from the dunk tank.  Yeah.  You know?  Well, that's not very nice.  No.  No, of course not, and we wouldn't do that to you.  Oh, thank you. 
[01:57:30]  Ooh, a communique on my BlackBerry.  Ooh.  You think it's Elo?  Location check.  Might be location check time.  Nope.  Nothing.  Maybe he's looking at his hair in the mirror.  Left my extra large metal on your desk.  Elo, location check.  Right behind a beer.  Yeah, he had a roast day yesterday, huh?  Oh.  All right, let's go to Francine.  He actually holds a beer in each hand and then picks the third one up with his teeth and just back, brings it back. 
[01:58:00]  Alky.  Without further ado, it's okay.  Francine's going to do the news, so.  Yeah.  All right.  You want the ticker?  Yeah, Derek's got it in the other room.  Oh.  That's the ticker.  Cook.  Take a cook.  Stay out the bushes.  There you go.  All right.  We're with Jesse Jackson for inspiration.  Thank you.  And now, Francine with the news.  Francine.  Apologize to ONA is what I say to the church. 
[01:58:30]  As one of your holy men in robes has been caught up in yet another sex scandal.  Seems as though rector of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Monsignor Eugene Clark, has been carrying on an adulterous affair with his married secretary, Laura DeSolipo.  Excuse me, you have to, because there's a stupid glitch, you have to, at least, who is he again, because there's been two problems. 
[01:59:00]  He's a, he's a rector of St. Patrick's, of St. Patrick's, because he's the girl, Monsignor Eugene Clark.  Egg Eugene?  Clark.  Yeah.  Now get this, the daily news reports that many worshippers at St. Patrick's said they were grateful that the scandal wasn't worse.  Right.  Translation, well, at least he wasn't caught with a 12-year-old boy. 
[01:59:30]  Ah, exactly.  Let me tell you something, you fake wannabe, righteous douchebags.  We went through two years with no radio.  You took our pride and joy off the air, and we had to deal with Howard and Limbaugh and O'Reilly and that misogynistic fat fuck from California.  You came from the same church that got our pals ONA, exiled out of Radioland for two years for a stunt they had nothing to do with.  Uh, this rector is in and out of Vaginaville as he pleases, and this is all you have to say. 
[02:00:00]  You disgust me.  Oh, very good.  I like the editorial.  Definitely.  I think the most impressive part there was learning that Steve had a radio show in California.  Monsignor Cook.  That's a hell of a start to the news right there, ladies and gentlemen.  Thank you.  All right, Francine, continue.  This is bad news for the church as it's already dealing with Sandra Giselle, who has supposedly bedded for her Christian Brothers Academy Catholic school students. 
[02:00:30]  Giselle 42, uh, described as a stunning blonde, is married to a powerful Albany banker, and has been...  Where is he a banker?  Albany.  One more time.  Where?  Albany.  Okay.  Where is Albany?  Uh...  I'm trying to think where Albany is.  Albany, Albany. 
[02:01:00]  Do you know where, let's say...  Are you good with state capitals?  A little bit.  What is the state capital of our fine state of New York?  That would be Manhattan.  Very good.  Manhattan, very good.  Thank you.  Okay.  Thank you.  And where is this, uh, guy from?  He's from Albany.  Albany.  Albany.  Albany.  Okay.  I think we should do a few more capitals.  Well, uh...  I only...  Maybe after the news. 
[02:01:30]  I don't know many.  How about this?  Louisiana.  Oh.  Yeah, what's the capital of Louisiana?  Uh, Cincinnati?  Cincinnati.  Cincinnati, Louisiana.  That's what's true.  Two for two.  Very good.  Anyone else have a capital they want to know?  Nathaniel's always good for one.  Nathaniel?  What is the capital of Sacramento?  Ooh.  Would it be California?  Very good.  The capital of Sacramento is indeed California. 
[02:02:00]  Three for three.  Nathaniel, you got one?  Washington State.  Ooh, not...  Washington State.  Washington State.  This is a tough one.  Do you know any cities in Washington State?  Um, I do know that they wear flannel shirts.  Okay.  And...  Pop in a time machine and go back 15 years.  Yeah, and concrete, maybe.  And, uh, Microsoft is somewhere out there.  Oh, very good. 
[02:02:30]  Very good.  Um, that's Silicon Valley.  Very good.  Silicon Valley.  That's it.  Okay.  But what's the capital?  Uh, Washington State?  Mm-hmm.  Um, I'll have to pass.  Mm, she's passing.  All right.  Three for four is not bad, though.  Thank you.  All right.  Louisiana you got with Cincinnati, I was surprised.  That was a good one.  All right, why don't we go back to the news?  Derek, if you will, here's Francine with the news. 
[02:03:00]  Janine Pirro fumbled and paused for 32 seconds during her first official speech for her run  for the U.S. Senate.  After 32 seconds, she said,  Where's page 10?  Seems that the hero spent too much time bashing Hillary Clinton instead of concentrating on the issues.  During her speech, she told her, uh, listeners, 
[02:03:30]  Clinton shortchanged New York.  She hasn't delivered, and she will find out that the people of New York have not forgotten her empty promises.  Note to Pirro, Hillary Clinton is very much still the frontrunner for this race,  with 68% of the vote, according to the Post.  So instead of trying hard to point out what Hillary hasn't done,  why don't you go home and memorize your speech?  The Daily News reports Pirro, who's been trying to cover up her philandering, 
[02:04:00]  money-laundering husband,  has been pocketed, uh, pocketed $12,000 in campaign funds from firms associated with organized crime.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Italians, right?  That's bad.  Italians, that's bad.  Yep.  So, you, I guess you're a Hillary Clinton supporter, based on what I just heard?  Yes.  Yeah.  You know the show doesn't like her at all, right?  Oh, you don't?  No.  Nah, she's...  Well, she's a woman.  Well...  We like women. 
[02:04:30]  We just don't like her.  Do you like Janine instead?  I don't know if I like her either.  Well, I like her.  I think she's got spunk, that Janine.  Let's go to Nick in Wisconsin.  Nick?  Nick?  Hi, uh, I was wondering if Francine could tell me the capital of Gainesville.  Gainesville?  Oh, that might be a tough one.  Gainesville.  Gainesville.  The capital of Gainesville.  Hmm.  Gainesville?  Come on, Francine.  You're three for four. 
[02:05:00]  That's not bad.  I know you could get this one.  Concentrate.  Some of these guys are calling you stupid out there.  I know you have it in you.  Come on.  Would it be...  Uh...  Hmm.  Anything?  Gainesville.  She's got it.  I know you got it.  It's on the tip of her tongue.  Tallahassee?  Tallahassee!  She pulls it up, baby!  Tallahassee. 
[02:05:30]  Four for five.  Oh, you were making me sweat.  You wanted to move to Maryland, you were saying?  Yes.  Do you know the capital of Maryland?  I always thought it was Washington, D.C.  Washington, D.C. is its own little entity.  No, no.  Well, it's the District of Columbia.  Yes, yes.  It's its own...  So, the capital.  What is the capital of Maryland?  Hmm.  Well, I said it.  I thought it was D.C.  Hmm.  And you're right. 
[02:06:00]  It is indeed.  It's a trick question, French.  I was trying to throw you, but you are un-throwable.  Woo!  One more before we get back to the news.  Mike in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, man?  Hey.  Hey, long-time fan.  First time listening to you guys back on the satellite, man.  Just got out of the military.  I haven't heard you guys in about four years.  Nice.  Wow.  Welcome home.  Welcome home.  Stop.  Fuck's bad.  All right.  Go ahead, Mike.  What do you got?  Hey, do you know where the capital of Thailand is? 
[02:06:30]  Thailand.  Or do you even know where Thailand is?  I believe Thailand is an Asian country.  Very good.  It's somewhere in the ocean.  Very good.  And I like Thai food.  Oh.  Well, that pretty much describes Thailand and where it is.  Right.  And what they do.  It's a place where sneakers never fall off.  A lot of people want to know where you graduated college because, you know, there's a lot of 
[02:07:00]  parents out there and they want to send their kids to a nice college.  It seems like you have a lot of knowledge.  So why don't you give your college a plug?  Talby, New York University.  There you go.  New York University.  NYU.  That's right.  All right.  Why don't we get back to the news with Francine?  Dove Soap Company is still getting plenty of attention for their new advertising campaign  for women with real curves, which includes the production of several billboards and magazines 
[02:07:30]  ads with six, quote, unquote, average-sized broads in the background.  The fact of the matter is these women are not average.  For although they are fat, they have a visible waistline, no cellulite, no rolls, no guts,  no triple chins, no stretch marks.  And for the most part, they're not unattractive.  Hey, Dove, if you want to be real, here's a suggestion for your next ad campaign. 
[02:08:00]  Why don't you get Oprah, Star Jones Reynolds, her faggot husband, Eliza Minnelli, Leona Hounsley,  and Whoopi Goldberg, get them together, and take a picture of them in their underwear  with two socks rolled up in their panties, and call it for women with real balls.  Put that on Times Square.  Till then, I'll stick to my Lever 2000.  Make for your 2000 body parts. 
[02:08:30]  Is that what you use, Lever 2000?  Sure do, it smells great.  Very good.  And it keeps your skin very smooth and shiny, right?  But she makes a point with that Dove ad, this Dove, right?  That's right.  They're trying to present real women and fat women.  Right.  But they're not really, they're not real fat women.  Yep.  Yeah.  They're not really fat.  They're still models.  And they're relatively attractive.  There you go.  There you have it.  Let's say hi to Joe in Massachusetts. 
[02:09:00]  Joe?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, I want to ask Francine if she knows the capital of Chicago, the truck driver, and  I've been all over the place, and she's been doing an awesome job, and I don't think she  can get this one.  That is a tough one.  The capital of Chicago.  This is a tough one.  What are you, five for six so far?  You missed that one, right?  Yep.  Chicago would be Illinois.  The capital of Chicago is Illinois.  That's right.  Yep.  That's six for seven.  Pronounce S.  We'll take one more before we get back to the news. 
[02:09:30]  Brian?  St. Louis?  Checking in?  Go ahead.  Yeah, I want to know what the capital of Indiana is.  Oh, wow.  That's a really tough one.  I don't even know if I know that one.  That would be Minneapolis.  Holy crap.  Minneapolis, Indiana.  Yeah.  How'd you learn the capitals?  That would be geography class.  Very good.  I guess they have a pretty good geography program over there at NYU.  Well, I learned it in junior high school.  Junior high.  All right.  That's coloring. 
[02:10:00]  What do they give you, crayons and a map?  No, we got color pencils.  Color pencils and a big map of the United States, and you got to color in the states and mark  the capitals.  Yep.  Did you enjoy doing that?  I enjoyed the coloring part.  It was strange.  I don't doubt it for a second.  Dean of NYU checking in and just wants to say, thanks, Francine.  For the plug.  Not a problem.  All right.  Let's get back to the news with Francine.  Coming to subway stations near you are future robberies, rapes, and possible murders. 
[02:10:30]  And you know that from almost experience.  That's right.  That's what some critics are fearing, as the MTA system is planning on spending all their  monies and surplus on building their headquarters over the west side of rail yards, instead of  hiring more security personnel and token booth workers.  So, as you get home dumbfounded that your iPod, wallet, and card keys are missing, or if you're 
[02:11:00]  staring Google-eyed, scared shitless, staring at some homeless guy jerking off across from  you because you were too busy reading your John Grisham novel, you can say, thanks, MTA.  You make my fucking day.  Oh, a little rhyme.  It rhymed.  It did.  And that really did happen to me.  I was reading my John Grisham novel.  Which one?  Was it the one about the young lawyer who has the thing to overcome?  Wait, let me try to remember. 
[02:11:30]  I believe it was A Time to Kill.  Okay, what's A Time to Kill about?  It was about, actually, they made a movie with it, and it was about Samuel Jackson's daughter  got raped by two rednecks, and he killed them before their court case.  So, he had a...  You're damn right I did!  He had a white lawyer represent him, and it was like back in the days, and supposedly there 
[02:12:00]  was a lot of racism.  Good old days?  No, it wasn't back in the days, was it?  What year was it supposed to be, Thann?  Modern Times, whatever year the movie came out?  I had no idea, but it didn't look like it was Modern Times, because they didn't have like  Fords and stuff like that.  They didn't have Fords, right.  Of course.  But, yeah, that was what the book was about, so I was busy reading it, and this was the  first incident that happened to me on the train that was really awful, and I was really  busy reading and enjoying the book, and the car got empty and some freak got on, and by 
[02:12:30]  the time I looked up, he was jerking off.  Really?  Right in front of me.  Of course, right in front of you.  Did that bother you?  Of course it did.  Of course.  I was very uncomfortable.  Maybe it was the book cover he was looking at.  No, I don't think it was the book cover.  Was he looking at you?  Did he finish?  I ran, so I don't know.  You're running away a lot.  Might as well just run home at this point.  The subway is not working out for you. 
[02:13:00]  Why don't you stop working in the Bronx?  Well, I tried to get a job in the city, and it's really hard.  Why?  I don't know.  I send out my resume all the time, but nobody calls me back.  I wonder why.  What's on your resume?  Can we please see that?  I'll fax you guys a copy.  I'd like to see it.  Maybe we can help you out.  And is it in crayon?  Tony in New Hampshire.  Oh, it's in ink.  Oh, yeah.  I just wanted to ask Francine if she knew, if she could help me with what country England 
[02:13:30]  is in.  Oh, now you're in.  And maybe an export.  I'm writing a report.  I need import, exports.  What country is England in?  Now I think you're just messing with her.  That's an easy one.  That's right, because we're talking.  Blair is the president.  Right.  And England is next to.  But what country is it part of?  The UK.  The UK.  All right.  Very good.  The United Kingdom.  And it's next to Ireland, I believe.  All right. 
[02:14:00]  Very good.  And they have problems with it.  Yeah.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I've been reading.  Mm-hmm.  Okay.  How many more news stories, or is that it?  Just a couple of celebrity news stories.  Oh, those are always fun.  We'll end with some celebrity news with Francine, okay?  Derek?  No?  There it is.  All right.  Oh, I thought we'd get the...  Oh, you want to do that?  I think so.  Yeah, a little low.  All right.  Hold on.  We'll get that in a second for you, Francine.  Okay. 
[02:14:30]  Let's see.  Illegal Joe in Canada.  Good morning, boys.  What's up, Joe?  I'm hoping Francine can settle a bet between me and my friend.  I'm looking for the capital of Atlantis.  Ooh.  Capital of Atlantis.  Yeah.  Uh, Georgia?  Georgia, Atlantis, Georgia.  Told you.  Why?  Your friend said Georgia?  Yeah.  I think you lost that bet, my friend.  Thanks, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Francine.  You're welcome. 
[02:15:00]  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Are you guys going to be on in Canada when the XM starts up?  I'm hearing we're going to be.  Awesome.  Oh, Canada.  I don't know the rest.  When does Canada start?  XM Canada.  Yeah.  When does that start?  I think soon, huh?  Wasn't ELO up in Canada?  Yeah.  He's doing something.  He had a location check in Toronto.  Toronto.  So.  There would be no reason to go to Canada for something satellite related unless we're going  to be.  I'm hearing we're going to be part of XM Canada.  How cool is that?  Sure. 
[02:15:30]  All right.  Do we have the entertainment music for Francine?  Here we go, Francine.  Cool.  People Magazine reports that former pop star Paul Abdul is still swimming in deep shit over  allegations from former contestant Corey Clark who claims he had her bent over screaming,  Do, do, do, you love me, do, you love me.  Clark shocked Idol fans in May when he appeared on ABC Primetime Live alleging he had sexual 
[02:16:00]  relations with Abdul and cheated by coaching him for the show.  Yes.  We heard about that.  Paula, you're a judge in a contest.  You can't fuck your contestants.  That's like sleeping with your college professor for better grades.  It's unfair to the others.  If Clark can prove that you did indeed pummel that ass, you should be canned from all judging 
[02:16:30]  panels, you filthy slut.  Do you know anything about sleeping with professors for grades?  I'll plead the fifth.  Oh.  Did you really?  Did you really?  Did you sleep with a professor once?  Uh, no.  Yes, you did.  No, I didn't.  Yes, you did.  What'd you do?  Huh?  What'd you do?  No, I didn't.  What'd you do?  What'd you do?  Come on, what'd you do?  It's just us and a few friends listening.  How did it happen?  It's XM.  No one listens.  Yeah, really.  Are you sure?  Yeah, we have like 8,000 listeners. 
[02:17:00]  What was after school anyway?  It was after you finished school or after the day?  After I finished school.  After you finished school.  Yep.  There was a professor.  Mm-hmm.  And you went out with him and some sections.  How old were you?  Uh, I forget.  I was in my 20s.  How long ago was it?  You were in your 20s.  So it was, uh, your fifth or sixth year of college.  A year ago.  So, was there some chemistry there during the class?  Uh.  I don't mean it was chemistry class. 
[02:17:30]  No.  How old is he?  I'm at 40.  Yeah.  And what was the class?  That's a good question.  What did you get in it?  What grade?  A plus.  She doesn't even know what the class was.  No.  And got an A plus.  Aunt and I will be paying for your rent to stay in Manhattan.  You can't go anywhere.  Absolutely not.  You've got to stay here.  You've got to stay here. 
[02:18:00]  So, we'll teach you to drive.  We'll get you a job.  We'll pay your rent.  Did you, uh, approach him?  But you don't remember what class it was?  Uh, it had something to do with, uh, government and history.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And did you approach him?  No.  Um, we'd been emailing each other for a while.  Not really a while.  He stopped emailing me.  And then his girlfriend went away somewhere.  She left.  White guy? 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  Ah.  And then, uh, he wrote me and he was like, well, she went away.  So, I was like, whatever.  So, then he wrote me back.  And I was like, okay, well, he's writing me.  So, I guess I'll talk to him.  So, then we exchanged phone numbers off the internet.  Because, um, yeah, and then that's how it happened.  And so, then you called each other and started talking.  Yeah.  And you hooked up for a date.  Yeah.  You, uh, went out.  Oh, did you go anywhere or just, it was just sex?  No, we went, like, we went out.  Yeah.  Where?  Where did he take you? 
[02:19:00]  Well, we went to the...  A fine piece of ass like you, where did he take you?  To eat.  Where?  That's it.  It was like a bar restaurant.  Uh-huh.  A little bar restaurant.  And then was it back to his place or yours?  Well, I was living with my aunt at that time.  So, I couldn't go back to my place.  No.  So, it was back to his place.  Yep.  Nice place?  Pretty nice.  Yeah.  Okay.  And then, uh, what happened?  Like, was it awkward?  Is it your professor?  Or was it just, you know, you guys had been drinking at the bar and just get in, tear the  clothes off and go to it? 
[02:19:30]  Well, I think it was just gradual.  Yeah.  And I think he was, I think he'd liked me for a long time.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, I hadn't had sex in a year and a half, so I really had to.  Really?  So, that's how, yeah, he was lucky.  He was lucky.  Yep.  Was he a good bang?  He was all right.  He was all right.  Did you make him wear a bag?  Of course I did.  Are you serious?  Oh.  Rookie.  Rookie.  And that was it? 
[02:20:00]  No, so we went out for like six.  Did he flip you over?  Six.  What do you mean flip me over?  Did he try to put it in your poop chute?  Yeah.  No, but he kept trying to get me to give him oral sex.  That was gross.  And you said no?  Yep.  Why?  You don't give Hummers?  Well, what's gross about it?  What's gross about it?  Yeah.  I just don't like doing it.  No, huh?  Hmm.  Grabbed the back of your head, did he?  Trying to push your head down a little bit?  No, but he was always talking about it.  Yeah, I bet.  That was really annoying. 
[02:20:30]  Did he say things like...  How about a blowjob?  Don't you love blowjobs?  Oh, I love getting blowjobs.  How about a blowjob?  You ever...  Just like that, I swear.  Really?  Exactly like that.  There's candy in it.  You don't give Hummers, Francine?  Well, I have, but not a lot.  So, Francine.  Not really a fan of that?  Not a fan.  Did he do that to you?  Of course he did.  Of course he did.  I didn't ask him to.  He just did it.  Yeah.  Was he good at that?  Yeah, he was alright.  Alright. 
[02:21:00]  This guy stunk.  This guy was awful.  That's the reaction after a year and a half without getting dick, and he gives it to  her and say, yeah, it was alright.  Yeah.  A year and a half.  It was awful.  Wow, man.  What was the problem with him?  Obviously there was a problem.  Well, I think it was just, for me, I think it was just the aura of it.  You know, sleeping with your professor was kind of cool.  Yeah.  And then, uh, the other thing was, uh, I had to have it.  It was a year and a half.  You have to do it after a while.  Yeah. 
[02:21:30]  So.  Why was he lousy?  Like, what was it about it?  After a year and a half?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I just didn't like it.  No, huh?  I couldn't get into, well, I didn't, you know, I faked it all, but.  Faked.  It's a classic.  Something tells me that if you're having sex with Francine and you look over, her eyes  are open and she's just looking at the ceiling and you know she's just somewhere else.  Yeah.  Just bored.  Just trying to figure out what's going on.  Like, if you just stopped fucking her and said pizza, she'd go, I like pizza. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  Whatever.  Oh, this is a very good question.  Joe the trucker.  I always get confused by this one.  Joe, go ahead.  Hey, she's so good with geography.  I'm just wanting to know if she's got an A plus in history.  Does she know who won the Civil War?  Oh, very good.  Who won the Civil War?  The Civil War.  That'll be the Americans?  The Americans.  Technically, that's correct.  Technically.  She is correct.  We'll give that one to you. 
[02:22:30]  Do you know who is fighting in the Civil War?  The Americans and the Japanese?  The Japanese.  Very good.  Wow.  And we're looking at 1945.  On this day, the Japanese were defeated in the Civil War.  They surrendered.  Bravo.  Yeah.  That's right.  And that's what happened 60 years ago to tie this all around.  And the whole thing, the Emancipation Proclamation came out of that?  Mm-hmm.  You know what that is? 
[02:23:00]  That would be the freeing of the slaves.  Bravo.  Another correct answer.  Very good.  Thank you.  Do you have one last story?  Yeah, I guess I could do one last one story for the...  Yeah, one more story.  All right, let's hit it.  Francine.  Can somebody shove a cocktail in Jennifer Aniston's throat?  She doesn't like it.  This bitch can't...  I was thinking that about five minutes ago.  This bitch can't stop whining about her breakup with Brad Pitt. 
[02:23:30]  No wonder he left the...  You can catch Jennifer crying and whimpering on the cover of every magazine and newspaper.  In between her buckets of tears, she told Danny C. Fair,  there's an amazing man wandering the streets right now who's the father of my children.  Jen, it's women like you that make the rest of us chicks look bad.  Stop whining and get a new dick.  Wow. 
[02:24:00]  All right.  Because let's face it, you're no matchup for Angelina Jolie.  And last but not least, former ABC news anchor Peter Jennings is dead, but you're not.  So tune in next time when I'll tell you the telltale signs of lung cancer.  Oh, very good.  That's it.  A teaser.  A teaser.  She left us hanging.  That's right.  Like she did her teacher.  Yes.  Left them hanging out in the breeze.  Wow.  I don't know what to say.  Hey, would you put this in your mouth? 
[02:24:30]  Uh, the ink needs to be changed.  How would he ask you?  Like, what would he say?  Just like how Anthony said it.  Yeah?  Just like...  Talking about blowjobs all the time.  Constantly and saying it like repeatedly.  Like, can I get a blowjob, can I get a blowjob, can I get a blowjob.  Did you kiss it?  A little odd?  No.  Why?  Did you just...  Did you have a dirty penis?  I don't even care.  I just don't like doing it.  Did you sniff it?  No.  What do you do?  You gotta peel back the skin and put your nose right under the helmet rigging.  Oh, God. 
[02:25:00]  You are disgusting.  All right.  We gotta take a break.  Francine, thank you so much for coming in on the news.  Another bang-up job.  We can't wait to have you back on the program.  Thank you.  Please don't move anytime soon.  She is a star.  She's a star in the making.  Thank you.  We'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program in just a bit.  It's time for everyone's favorite game show.  Match wits with a halfwit.  I don't get it.  Starring Francine.  As the halfwit.  And Master of Ceremonies, Anthony Burt Convier-Kumia. 
[02:25:30]  With subjects like famous women in history.  Do you know who Helen Keller was?  Um, is she a star?  No.  Geography.  What is the capital of New York?  Manhattan.  Eh, wrong idiot.  And U.S. presidents.  Lincoln, what was his biggest impact on the country as president?  He wore a big hat.  You're what they call ignorant.  Don't let her taunts intimidate you.  I'm book smart.  What kind of book?  I just read a lot of Christian novels. 
[02:26:00]  God.  If you have the slightest ability to retain information, you'll win.  I did really bad in high school.  Away with you.  Away.  Away.  Leave.  Anyone can win at this game.  Right, Francine?  Amen, sister.  Are you breathing?  Are you breathing?  Now, now, we go.  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm going to talk about the vacation now. 
[02:26:30]  Someone is going to die.  Will you listen to me?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Are you alive?  Will you listen to me?  I'm going to talk about the vacation now.  Someone is going to die.  Will you listen to me?  Will you listen to me?  Will you listen to me?  Will you listen to me?  Will you listen to me?  Will you listen to me?  All right.  Let's go right to the phones and say hi to Jock.  What's up, Jock?  Hey, boy.  Hey, Jocko.  Hey, Jock.  Hey, the second golden ticket goes to Francine.  I could listen to her all day long.  She is really good, man.  There is just something about listening to her.  Good job, guys.  I'm out of here. 
[02:27:00]  All right.  The combination of the whole thing, the intelligence, the voice.  Yeah.  Fantastic, isn't it?  She's just smooth as silk when it comes to the news.  One instant feedback said that she sounds like a drunken Cindy Brady.  Yeah.  Very good.  Yeah, we like Francine.  We're going to have to have her back soon.  I agree.  It's been way too long.  She's only been on the new show, I think, two or three times.  That's it.  She graduated from NYU.  Yeah.  What do you do?  I am stupefied. 
[02:27:30]  I learned to fix printers.  What happens to them?  What do you fix?  Ink?  All right.  Not only is it the most common question, the most basic thing you can think of, but it  was kind of answered in question form.  Because she wasn't sure.  Ink?  Yeah, I think it's ink.  Yeah, ink.  That's a short skirt.  Maybe he doesn't even put the printer on the floor.  Maybe he puts it way up on the top shelf and has a ladder by it.  Yeah.  He's just got to crawl up the ladder.  Go change that printer and let a log slip out.  No one's looking.  Make a little peek. 
[02:28:00]  Ooh.  Ooh.  All right.  Fill it up.  Mm.  You remember how that happened, though?  You just fill it up a little bit?  A little bit?  A little plump?  Yeah, a little plump.  You got a little plump?  Yes, but usually when I'm...  What?  He's saying that and it's a room full of guys.  But that's not why I'm filling up, dude.  It's just...  How are we supposed to answer that?  Truthfully.  I don't mean...  I'm not looking at you guys filling up.  What are you filling up all of a sudden for? 
[02:28:30]  I think...  Is he fantasizing about Francine?  Maybe I was just thinking about her in a short skirt and a ladder.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Well, there you go.  That's not you and your apple cake.  Although it is low fat.  It's blueberry.  Oh, is it?  Yeah.  I'm obsessed with blueberries.  I like blueberry, too.  They say they're a superfood.  I was going to say, I love superfoods.  It's a superfood.  I just see a lot of salmon.  Salmon, blueberries, spinach.  Why couldn't ass be a superfood?  What?  I'd be fucking on my road to good health. 
[02:29:00]  The ass.  What signifies a superfood?  I don't know.  And what do they do?  Why are they so super?  Well, it has a bunch of...  It's any food that's paralyzed.  This poor chum fell off a horse.  Thanks, man.  It's a food that I think you could eat, almost get everything you need nutritionally out of it. 
[02:29:30]  I could be wrong.  Somebody in better shape than me, which is probably 98% of you could call it.  How could eating a blueberry be?  Antioxidants and stuff like that for good for cancer.  You can't just live off of a blueberry.  No, no, no.  But I think it has a lot of good things in it.  Goodness.  I almost said goodness.  It's the foods that are full of goodness.  That's right.  Thank you.  Thank you for that complete lack of any explanation.  I know.  Believe me.  Eric got me a website about superfoods.  Oh.  Try including some of the following superfoods into your diet. 
[02:30:00]  Each food contains vitamins, nutrients, and or minerals that are believed to contain special properties for health, disease prevention, and or longevity.  Some of the superfoods.  Broccoli.  Everyone loves broccoli.  It's everything that tastes bad, basically.  Broccoli.  Where is apple cake?  Carrots.  Is apple cake on that list of superfoods?  Oh, and it's not. 
[02:30:30]  It goes right to my thighs.  Chili peppers.  Spinach.  Oh, boy.  Mushrooms.  Superfood.  Mushrooms.  Tomatoes.  Strawberries.  Papaya, pineapple, and kiwi.  Mangoes.  Citrus fruits.  Apricots.  Bananas.  Garlic.  Green tea.  Beans.  Soybeans.  And tofu.  Salmon.  And oats.  Oats.  Oats.  Sounds like horrible stuff to eat. 
[02:31:00]  All that crap.  What are you going to do?  Eat some salmon and oats and then take a four-week shit.  Imagine this nice salmon and oats dump.  You know, walk in the bathroom after somebody drops that.  Fucking blueberry stains around the bowl.  All right, super colon, we get it.  It's just so healthy.  Log comes out with a cape on it.  Instead of farting, your asshole opens and you hear,  bam, bam, bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Bam.  Why is it that everyone... 
[02:31:30]  Going to the toilet of solitude.  Huh?  Superman fortress of solitude?  No.  No.  I didn't get it.  That's great.  Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.  What's going on?  To unveil it.  Oh.  That's good.  Then the nurse, believed to be the one grabbed by a sailor she'd never met.  He really bent you back.  Yes.  Did you have any back damage or vertebrae injury or anything?  No.  No.  Not at that time.  Edith Shane is now 87.  She was 27.  Back then when both the Japanese and she surrendered unconditionally. 
[02:32:00]  What was the actual best kiss to remember in your life?  I've had a lot of benefits.  Broad's 87?  She likes to laugh and she likes men.  Wow.  You have three boyfriends?  Now?  Do you still kiss like this?  And she's a slut.  Just like the old days.  A sailor, his identity is murkier at the moment.  A Rhode Island man named George Mendonca has the edge, though others claim it's them.  Of course, I was drinking and celebrating and raising hell with everybody else. 
[02:32:30]  George's case was boosted by Mitsubishi researchers at the Merle Labs.  They did 3D imaging of George's face, then de-aged it.  That looks like him.  Seemed to get a pretty good match with the sailor's photo taken by Alfred Eisenstadt.  But in movies, guys who grab women and kiss them tend to get slapped.  Maureen O'Hara fractured her wrist, slapping John Wayne.  The kiss has ended up on a stamp. 
[02:33:00]  It's been parodied on The Daily Show and on this Don't Ask, Don't Kiss and Tell New Yorker cover.  Kiss me like that.  These two celebrated their 20th anniversary by imitating a 60-year-old kiss.  Can I bend you back?  Let's see.  How do we do this?  Genie Moe, CNN, New York.  Crack her hip.  She's 87.  She makes it Genie whatever.  Breaks her hip.  What happened is if she hit the ground, all of her bones would just turn to dust. 
[02:33:30]  Like if you unwrapped a mummy quickly.  It would just be a pile of skin and a working mouth and head.  A leech with gray hair.  Obviously, they're talking about the famous kiss in Times Square that happened 60 years ago today.  It was the sailor.  VJ Day victory over the Japs.  Who bent over the nurse and planted a big wet kiss on her.  And I love those.  This is the beautiful thing about those days.  Instead of fighting them off, she holds her hat to make sure it doesn't fall.  Don't let the hat slip off. 
[02:34:00]  I like it.  Yeah, this was a soldier.  It's in Times Square.  The nurse, who was, I guess, in a building in Times Square.  They hear about the end of the war.  That's it.  The Japs surrender.  Everybody runs out onto the street to celebrate.  This woman comes out.  And this sailor is walking by her.  Sees a pretty nurse.  Just grabs her by the waist.  Dips her.  And they start making out.  And a photographer was there.  Snapped the picture.  It's a famous picture now.  But it's one of those sweet memories of old, picture, historic. 
[02:34:30]  No one looks at it like, holy shit, that guy would be in jail today.  Let's go down to Times Square right now and reenact it.  In jail.  Locked up.  To show you how times have changed.  Oh, have the times changed.  That and the nurse would look up, why'd you kiss me, daddy?  Yeah.  Saturn honking in the picture.  Man, man, man, man.  Hey. 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  Times are a little different these days.  That, like, the way the country has changed.  Forget it.  Yeah.  I defy anybody.  Go down to Times Square.  I like how they had someone reenacting it.  They were a couple.  They knew each other.  Just go down there.  Grab a woman off the street.  Dip her.  And start making out with her.  Watch how quickly you will have the police throwing you in jail.  Just jumping on you. 
[02:35:30]  Rustling into the car.  Oh, yeah.  You'd be pummeled.  There'd be pictures of you, all right.  Yeah, times have changed.  Getting a club over your head.  Is that how long ago?  60 years?  Someone took a photo of our own producer like that in Times Square once.  Oh, yeah?  On New Year's Eve, yes.  And he just stumbled out of a bar, and he was kissing an eight ball.  Eddie Griffin's calling in at 10. 
[02:36:00]  He's calling in.  Hey, dude, are any of the interns here?  That was Boston.  Oh, yeah.  Comes in with a guest suggestion today.  The 12-year-old kid that does news.  But then he casually drops.  He's from Boston.  He's from Boston.  Of course he is.  He's a Red Sox fan.  I'm from Boston.  Fox 25.  Ben doesn't notice anything until it's Boston or the Red Sox as well.  Then he pipes up.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  That's what happens.  Him and his brother.  His brother's a Yankee fan.  He's a Red Sox fan.  Darf!  Darf!  This is my favorite one, actually, from Laszlo yesterday.  Call me here, stupid!  Stupid!  Stupid!  Stupid!  All right.  So Eddie Griffin should be calling in at 10 o'clock.  Howie Mandel should be in studio at 1030.  And some dude, Caesars, here from the Big O and Duke show, dropping off a demo.  They want to be considered for one of the golden tickets. 
[02:37:00]  You want to explain the golden tickets?  Oh, well, we have our gig here on Satellite Radio.  We're very happy here.  There's a lot of freedom, a lot of opportunity to do the show we want to do.  Other people not happy with our show, according to the New York Radio Message Board.  What'd they type, Alp?  Having heard a number of ONA XM shows and having been a big fan of theirs for years,  I can honestly say that their show is not nearly as good now as it was on WNEW. 
[02:37:30]  That's not what I meant.  Half of the intrigue of the show was seeing how much they could get away with  and how they could mask what they are trying to say.  Wait.  Who's this guy?  Where's this guy?  I don't like this guy.  I don't like the new guy.  This guy's a whingy cousin from Long Island.  I like the other guy.  I want the other guy.  How's the other guy?  Happy to take.  I can't do the voice.  How did you lose it?  It was new.  You sound like fucking Shelley from Glen Gary Glen Ross now.  It was my only voice.  It's like when they changed the Fred Flintstone voice on me. 
[02:38:00]  I was expecting.  How did I do it?  Happy to take.  Seeing how much they could get away with  and how they could mask what they're trying to say well enough to survive the dump button  while still letting you know what they meant.  That's the guy.  He's back.  The no-holds-barred satellite universe takes all that intrigue away.  I don't think their XM show is half as good as their N.E.W. show was.  His arms are flailing like it's typing.  But he's not even typing anymore.  He's just moving them up and down. 
[02:38:30]  I can't do the voice anymore.  No, that's the voice.  You had it.  He kind of wafts in and out of it a bit.  Every day there's another ass that is just trying to wreck our buzz.  You know what annoys me is when they say that part of the fun was the intrigue.  No, it wasn't, you asshole.  That's a necessary evil.  It was a pain in the ass.  Oh, yeah.  F&A, much funnier.  It's not.  That's your repressed, naughty humor, dog shit mentality. 
[02:39:00]  Watch Richard Pryor.  Is he funnier, uncensored, or censored?  Is it funny watching movies and sitcoms try to get around naughty situations?  Or is it funnier watching something on HBO or when you rent it?  Right.  I'm so sick of that shit.  That's part of the talent.  Half the fun was listening to him.  No, it wasn't.  It's not.  It sucked.  We hated it.  If it was half the fun for a few of you out there, it was none of the fun for us.  Yeah, you're repressed douches, and you should appreciate humor for what it is, and not, 
[02:39:30]  oh, that was almost naughty.  Stop needing a built-in excuse for yourself to laugh at something, asshole.  You know how much great stuff just got dumped out that listeners never heard?  Absolutely.  Over the years when we were on commercial radio?  It's got to be two or three things I can remember.  You know what's great, though?  As soon as someone trashes us, our pests, they are so aggressive now.  They have taken over the world, basically, because they have a whole network, and all  it takes is guys, O&A, getting abused on New York Radio Message Board.  Wham!  And then everyone goes there and sticks up for us. 
[02:40:00]  Yeah.  You know?  Some dude, speaking of which, a pest, he wrote Starbucks.  Where's the Starbucks email I asked for?  Do we have that yet?  Where is it, Hawk?  Hawk asked for it, and I don't see it.  It was supposed to be printed up for the show today.  But basically, there's a whole thread on this New York Radio Message Board how this show  is not as good as the regular show.  And I strongly, strongly disagree.  I think this show is so much better than what we were doing at WNEW.  And a lot of people write why this show is better on the New York Radio Message Board 
[02:40:30]  in an intelligent way.  And you know what?  I appreciate those guys for sticking up for us.  Yeah.  Because it gets to be a pain in the ass.  Every day, you've got to read something bad about the show or something.  And we've been quite successful at this for many years now.  Part of the fun was watching them get around things.  There's less nudity and sex on this show than there was on the old show.  Yeah.  Less strippers or any of that crap.  Less shocking.  There's more content.  Occasionally, profanity.  We can play bits we couldn't play. 
[02:41:00]  There's more content on this show than on the other show, by far.  It could be more tasteless.  The Pest really bought billboards in Orlando?  Yep.  No way.  Yeah, they're starting to buy billboards for us and stuff.  Yeah, they bought...  Where's the picture?  Wow.  They're going to be set up, I think, beginning of next week.  And what's the billboard going to say?  Hopefully something good.  It's attacking Jim Phillips with a big O&A ad right near his house and right near their radio station.  And they still haven't given up on Jim Phillips.  That's pretty funny.  Did they really buy that?  Through Clear Channel Entertainment.  Yep. 
[02:41:30]  Very nice.  Isn't that his company?  How do you not love these fucking psychopaths?  These lunatics.  And you know what?  Certain people, and maybe...  I'm not saying anybody in marketing here.  I'm just saying that some people, like in a company, would hear about their people being marketed by fans.  Yeah.  And they become ashamed and go, wow, we should do something.  But have a feeling...  All right, all right, good.  That'll leave you.  It's our responsibility.  I think if you have a creative mind, you can market anything without even spending money or very little money.  Because the argument's always, well, you know, we only have so much money in the budget to promote your particular show. 
[02:42:00]  But I think if you're creative, I think you could do some wonderful things to get the word out for the show.  We prove that on a daily basis with our Whip Him Out Wednesday.  The Assault on the Media contest, which is going very well for August.  We'll talk about that another day, I guess.  But Lion Guy from Alabama is still in the lead.  And the pests, of course, just attacking everything.  Greatest.  They're like locusts.  They're just eating everything in their path at this point.  Kevin Howard from Yonkers says it all about the subject we were talking about. 
[02:42:30]  The listener saying, you know, we used to have to skirt around the issue and it was a lot better.  He says four words.  Pat O'Brien sex tapes.  Exactly.  There you go.  There's a prime example.  If you listen to any regular radio station play those Pat O'Brien tapes, it was painful.  They played it because they felt compelled to play it like they had to play it.  It was such a big story.  But you know anyone on regular radio was playing those going, this fucking sucks.  Every other word's bleeped.  It wasn't entertaining. 
[02:43:00]  It wasn't funny.  They couldn't goof on it.  They couldn't really get into the story.  Make jokes about what he's saying because he couldn't say what he was saying.  We had free reign.  It's not even close between the two shows.  And then basically, I was explaining this to Ron and Fez because they're about to start  on Satellite Radio on this channel.  September 12th, they debut.  And I was explaining some things to them.  It's like, it's a pleasure to get into a subject.  Pleasure for me.  And just go until you know it's done.  On commercial radio, you're always worried about fitting 15, 20 minutes of commercials  in that you would stop yourself before you wanted to stop the bit because you just had 
[02:43:30]  no choice after a while.  Well, and to not have to worry about that when you sit in these chairs like we do, it's  an amazing thing.  Right.  It is so much fun.  Now we can do a bit until everybody out there has dozed off.  Well, I don't think we run bits into the ground like we used to either.  But like Pat O'Brien's next day, one of the things on commercial radio, you'd be saying  things like, God Almighty, put a C in her A. And that would be the joke.  The joke was the naughty little things you were saying. 
[02:44:00]  But now you realize that's a weak joke.  Yeah, he put his cock in her ass because we can say it.  So your jokes have to be better.  Believe it.  You have to be, when you have no excuse that you couldn't say something, you better be  fucking funny or you're completely exposed.  So that really annoys me, that bad argument.  It's just a bad, if you don't think the show is funny, that's fine.  But don't give that dog shit repressed argument.  Well, we fared pretty well in that argument on the message board.  It was nice to see.  It was a spat.  But another pest got involved because we're trying to get a Starbucks machine here at  the studio because we all drink Starbucks every morning. 
[02:44:30]  I personally spend, you know, like $10 a morning on coffee.  $10 every morning.  I'm not kidding.  So it's like $50 a week.  Easily.  Easily.  And he's worse.  Jimmy's probably worse.  I spend a lot more.  I've got to buy Starbucks stock.  Huh?  I forgot.  I've got to buy Starbucks stock.  How is that stock not just going through the roof?  Or is it?  I haven't even checked.  They're brilliant, dude.  They have an addictive product.  They're brilliant.  That they're selling at huge prices. 
[02:45:00]  They got the entire country addicted to coffee.  Yeah.  They're brilliant.  They're brilliant.  Before Starbucks, first of all, if you were under 50, you weren't drinking coffee.  You know, second of all, if you were, you had to get it from a deli, and the coffee was  absolutely awful.  It stunk.  How the hell did someone have that vision where, you know what, we could get everyone  from the age of 15 to 100 addicted to coffee?  Can they put the flavors in them, the whipped cream?  There's something for them.  Even if you're not a big coffee drinker, you go there and get something sweet. 
[02:45:30]  It's absolutely amazing.  And every afternoon, you know, the Starbucks in my neighborhood, and there's four within  two or three blocks of us, Jimmy.  There's a line practically out the door now, right around two.  Every one of them, right.  Two o'clock is coffee time for everybody.  It's amazing.  Look at our buddy on CNN.  I'm just looking at Bob Saget.  Bob Saget on CNN.  Let's take a peek.  That actually sustains a movie.  It's amazing that it sustains a movie, because it's not a good joke.  A horrible joke.  And the whole purpose of the joke is what 15-year-old boys would laugh about behind the 
[02:46:00]  schoolyard, which is, here's the worst thing I've ever heard.  A much different, Bob Saget.  Yes, gentlemanly.  That I heard, like 20 years ago, but supposedly it was Jack Benny told Gary Owens, who was  in the movie, I found out at the premiere.  It's just a very, um, it's a horrible joke.  Not one that we even want to share with anyone.  It's not funny at all.  Not funny at all.  And so, how did they do it, and why did they do it?  It's a hundred comedians that are, um, and some people don't tell the joke.  Robin Williams is in it, and Chris Rock, they don't tell the joke.  They tell the history of the joke, they tell around the joke, they tell stories about the 
[02:46:30]  joke, but some people don't tell the joke.  Right, they improv around it.  It takes ten minutes.  You saw the film.  Uh-huh.  It takes ten minutes to even get to the joke, which is fascinating.  George Carlin's the first one, right?  Yeah, he's the, I guess he's the Yoda of the movie.  Right, right.  But it seems like every single person who does the same old joke, which is a stupid joke, and  it's an old joke, and it's not a funny joke, everybody's personality comes right  through.  I think the key to it, too, is it's about desperation in show business.  How low will people go to make it in show business?  Would the aristocrats be booked on American Idol? 
[02:47:00]  You know, do their act, and then, you know, they all sit there and say, I don't really  like it.  Because if it's a long joke, you've really gone low.  You can supposedly tell this joke for a long time.  I've seen, when they filmed me, when Penn Jillette, the filmmaker, and Paul Provenza came  with their three digital cameras, I think I did about 20 minutes or 25 minutes.  I think the record was 30, right?  Don't they say in the movie the record's full of 30?  I think Chevy Chase, they used to have, Michael O'Donoghue, I believe, did it the longest.  Well, Chevy Chase was the longest before a laugh showed up.  I can never go back to family television. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah, I was going to say, so not your M.O., as far as we know.  All right, she's a bore.  I'd like to kiss her right in the mouth.  She's very pretty.  She's gorgeous, but she's a bore.  What were we just talking about before we put Bob Saget?  I had a point.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  Oh, no, that's okay.  A Starbucks.  But I want to say really fast to just finish with Bob Saget.  I saw Bob Saget's cameo on Entourage.  Holy crap, is it funny.  Entourage is just probably the best show out there right now.  Did a giant mammal just walk through the studio? 
[02:48:00]  I don't know what happened.  A furry animal just come in here?  I told you to take that garbage and bury it.  We're going to be eating.  Jimmy, you have your food laying there.  You're supposed to tie it up on the speakers so that the animals can't reach it.  You know what Steve was doing?  He was foraging.  He comes in, and his big Lebanese paws just clumsily knock things around the counter.  Foraging.  Then he walks back out ashamed.  We all think he's our friend, but eventually he's going to eat us.  Yes. 
[02:48:30]  And it's going to be in the middle of the show,  and this is all we're going to leave behind is our last words on radio.  We'll be mauled.  Just like that.  He'll end up in someone's pool in Jersey.  Just like that filmmaker.  That movie's hitting, I think, today.  Oh, what an asshole this guy was.  What a dick.  Some guy made a documentary about this bear lover.  Goddamn bear lover.  Made a movie about a bear lover who was living amongst the bears.  He made his own film, Anthony.  Yeah, but then this documentarian kind of took his... 
[02:49:00]  Oh, okay, I see what you're saying.  He made his video clips.  Yeah, basically this guy went out and decided to live with the bears,  and he filmed himself living with the bears,  and he thought the bears were his friends,  and they weren't going to do anything.  He was so delusional.  His whole thing was how they're gentle giants,  and this is wonderful to live among them,  and people don't understand the bears,  and that's the problem.  The fucking bears ate him.  They ate him!  How funny is that?  Is there footage of it?  Yeah, well, I don't know if they have the actual footage of him being...  It's him and his girlfriend.  Him and his girlfriend were eaten by the bears, 
[02:49:30]  and they finally found them, well, what was left of them,  and they found the camera,  and they made a whole documentary.  He would go right up to the bears and go,  look how close I am.  Look how wonderful this is.  How close I am to this beautiful...  And the bear's like, you know, Ramone.  And he winds up getting eaten by the bear.  How great is that?  Because he forgot that they're fucking animals,  and you are food. 
[02:50:00]  That's it.  They will eat you.  You can't get...  Humans are so stupid.  You think that there's this connection,  because you feed your dog and it licks your face.  No, they will eat you.  You think right now somewhere there's two lobsters  talking about a documentary that their one dumb lobster friend made?  Like, I don't know, it was this guy, Arnie Morton,  and he was hanging out,  and one day he tapped Arnie Morton on the nose,  and the next thing you know he's having his stomach open  with butter thrown on him.  They're all laughing at him. 
[02:50:30]  Asshole!  Never get out of the water!  Don't leave the water.  Stay away from people.  All right, we'll get more into that in a few minutes,  but first we got Eddie Griffin checking in.  Eddie!  Hey!  How are you, buddy?  How are you guys?  I'm good. What's happening?  I hear you got like five minutes with us.  You're doing the radio tour today?  Yes, I am.  One station after another.  One station after another.  And you got to make believe you're friends with everybody, right?  Yeah, you know.  Yeah.  So why should we go see Deuce Bigelow European Gigolo?  Because I'm in it.  Are you the funny part in the movie? 
[02:51:00]  There's a whole lot of funny parts.  That's right.  He's the guy.  He's, what are you, the pimp?  Yes, I'm pimping.  You're pimping, and you're pimping out Deuce?  Yes, of course.  I have the man house.  Why'd you guys decide,  or why'd they decide to make this one in Europe?  Let's see.  Because it worked well for vacation.  Was it like a vacation?  It was a vacation over in Amsterdam.  Prostitution is legal.  They actually did it over in Amsterdam?  You didn't just go to Canada?  No, we've been in Amsterdam for three months.  Did you pay for any sex in the windows? 
[02:51:30]  No, I don't buy.  You know, if you can't do it with the gift of gab,  then keep it moving.  Yeah, but it's something about Amsterdam,  buying it over there,  that seems kind of normal,  even for people that don't buy it over here,  because it's almost like, you know,  going to Walmart or something.  Yeah, like a mannequin in the window.  Yeah, you see any of that shit?  That actually has some juice.  They actually have chicks just standing in windows,  and when you walk by,  they'll like wave.  I haven't been to Rio three times,  and I'm a Brazil fan, yeah.  They're like real hot chicks, right?  I don't like Amsterdam as much, 
[02:52:00]  just because there's not as much AIDS.  I like Rio, where you can just dive head first.  Eddie, what about the weed?  Yes, I partook in the coffee shops, yes.  Yeah, you just walk into a coffee shop  and buy weed, right?  Yeah, they walk in it like candy,  you know, like a little glass,  and you got your chronic,  you got your wine, red hair,  your purple haze.  And you just buy it,  and are there any,  what, you can't leave the place, though,  or something?  Well, they say you can't leave the place,  but people leave.  Yeah, it's like nothing.  It's like don't leave with your coffee.  Come on, the police will walk up 
[02:52:30]  and light the joint for you over there.  Yeah, they don't care, right?  No, they don't care.  I met you years ago at the comedy store,  and we were talking about Richard Pryor,  and you said that,  are you doing something with the Richard Pryor story  where you're playing Pryor  or you're involved with it somehow?  Yeah, we shot Pryor Convictions for Showtime.  Oh, really?  Okay.  Wow, that's got to be a lot of pressure,  playing Pryor.  Yeah, that's a whole lot of pressure.  So when is it being aired,  or do you not know?  I have no idea.  Okay.  Did you hang out with him to try to...  I've known Richard for, 
[02:53:00]  let's see, 15 years now.  Really?  Yeah.  We haven't seen him around, though, lately.  How's he doing?  Well, they showed him on TV.  You know, Richard's a fighter, you know.  Yeah, I know.  He's hanging in there,  but the footage they showed recently,  I just...  MS is brutal, man.  Yeah, I didn't need to see that.  But is it mental, too,  or is it only physical?  Like, you just can't move?  It's physical.  Not really talking that well.  Yeah.  So, you know,  it's hard to figure out  what's going on mentally. 
[02:53:30]  That's the torture.  If, like, you're mentally...  Because, you know,  he's so brilliant.  If you are where you're supposed to be mentally,  and then just to realize  that you can't communicate  what you want to say  has got to be just fucking horrible  for a comedian, especially.  Yeah, that's quite torturous.  You've done a long, uh...  You started touring with Dice, right?  That was kind of how things  really started rolling for you.  Eddie?  Did we...  I'm going to call him right back.  Oh.  What happened?  Who hung up on him?  I'm not sure what happened.  I'm going to call him to find out. 
[02:54:00]  Who are you?  I'm the producer.  All right.  The producer.  The producer.  That was Ben?  No.  This guy's doing a job.  This guy's actually working.  He's right on the ball.  Ben wouldn't have thought  of calling him back.  He would have just eaten  his little cell phone.  We disconnected.  Ah!  All right.  Why don't you just highlight  that stuff on the screen?  Oh, well.  Anyway.  He's got a shitload of films  under his belt.  Someone was telling me,  but they hung up,  that they do have footage  of the grizzly bear  eating that guy, supposedly. 
[02:54:30]  No way.  I'm going to say no way.  Who was filming?  The bear?  Maybe they were making the,  maybe the guy was filming  when something happened.  And the camera got knocked out.  I'm definitely going  to go see that flick.  God, his girlfriend, too.  I wonder who got eaten first  when, ah, shit,  the bear's not as nice  as we thought.  How about leaving  while it's dining  on your partner there?  I'm sure it's playing  at my movie theater  where they sell  these smoked salmon sandwiches.  So I'll go see it  this weekend.  At a movie theater?  I told you about that.  My movie theater  sells smoked salmon sandwiches. 
[02:55:00]  I saw a movie  there with Steve  and they gave him bread.  He went,  he just knocked  the bread on the floor.  He was so insulted.  That's where I saw  Marsha of the Penguins  and other movies  and, you know,  I'll go see it  and I'll give you  a full review.  Give me a review.  By the way,  just in case you're wondering,  Bill Murray never  finds his son.  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  I don't know what movie  that is.  And a little advice  to Bill Murray.  Could you go back  to just making us  laugh really hard?  Will you stop? 
[02:55:30]  Groundhog Day.  Will you stop  with this nonsense  you've been filming lately?  Life Aquatic.  Could someone explain  Life Aquatic to me,  please?  I didn't see it.  I haven't seen it.  I don't know what it does.  And don't do a radio bit.  Someone call  the goddamn radio show  and tell me what  Life Aquatic was all about.  Yeah.  Another Wes Anderson disaster.  He develops great  characters in his movies,  but what the fuck  is he trying to say?  What was the, um...  And then Bill Murray's  in his Broken Flowers  fucking movie.  It's the slowest movie  I've ever seen 
[02:56:00]  and the reviewers  are going nuts  thinking it's the greatest  thing he's ever done.  Lost in Translation?  I like Lost in Translation.  It was boring.  I gotta be honest,  I like that.  Hello?  Yeah, there he is.  Yeah, we got all  these technology and...  You didn't like us, Eddie?  Huh?  We were disconnected.  We thought you didn't  like us.  Oh, no.  I didn't make the phone.  Oh, all right.  So where were we at?  We were talking about...  I was mentioning,  Eddie, I think, started...  The whole thing kind of  started for you  touring with Dice, right?  Yeah, back in August of 89.  Wow.  So you were doing  the arenas.  Yeah, 20,000 seats 
[02:56:30]  up in Madison Square Garden.  How cool is that?  Black man in the house.  How cool is that  when you're just facing  all those people  with your comedy?  That is...  That's like a...  A good bag of weed.  Really?  What goes through your brain?  I mean, all of a sudden  you're stepping out  to that microphone  and I'm sure you did  big rooms,  but now you're out  in front of 20,000 people.  Are you shitting?  You know what goes  through your brain?  Yeah.  I'm about to tear  the roof off this mother.  Yeah, that's what I like to hear.  Weren't you new  in the business, too, though? 
[02:57:00]  You were kind of like  young then.  I was 19 years old,  so I was too young  to have any kind of fear.  Oh, yeah, okay.  And then what?  Dice's crowd  is pretty savage, though,  when it comes to  people being up on stage  that aren't Dice.  Yes, indeedy.  Did they give you some shit?  Not at all.  No?  Yeah, I heard he actually  did really well consistently.  Who'd you see  eat their balls  really badly?  I know somebody  had to just take it  in the face horribly.  It was the opening guy  because I was middling.  Bill Schaaf.  Oh, Schaaf, yeah.  He's like Letterman's writer. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, yeah.  He's a pretty funny guy.  I know.  He's right up the ass  on those tours.  The funniest thing  I've ever seen Bill do,  he's supposed to do 15 minutes.  He condensed it  to five minutes  but didn't miss an inflection.  I've seen comedians  do that, man.  Because you give them  a little dead air  and they're going to  jump in there  with some heckles  or some boos and stuff.  He went five minutes flat  and then the guy  went over there  and I said,  whoa, you know,  that's how you do it.  How's Rob Schneider?  Cool?  Oh, yeah.  He didn't try to steal  your chick or anything,  did he? 
[02:58:00]  No, come on, man.  I saw him do that  one day to Hugh Hefner.  He stole one of  Hugh's Playboy chicks.  One of those eight chicks  that he was dating  or seven chicks, yeah.  Some award thing  we were doing.  I don't even know  what it was  but we were at  the after party  and Rob Schneider  was coming down  the stairs  with this hammered  Playboy chick  and we found out  later she got fired  the next day  for leaving with Rob Schneider.  Dude, you know how great  that is that a comedian  stole some pussy  from Hugh Hefner?  I know.  I thought it was huge.  But now he's got to  have a lifetime ban, man.  Oh, is he banned 
[02:58:30]  from the Playboy mansion?  He's got to be banned  from the mansion.  Yeah, I think Hef  was pretty pissed.  You can't mess  with Hef's pussy.  Hef is fucking 80.  Who cares?  How many more parties  are they going to be?  Three more.  He'll fall down  a step sooner or later.  Fuck him.  Eddie, you know that  the movie's getting  a lot of bad reviews.  We're trying to be cool here  but I mean when you read  some of these reviews  what do you think?  I haven't read any.  Oh, okay.  Alright, let's break it up.  No, no, I don't want  to kill the guy  but I mean the New York papers  are not being kind  to this movie.  Oh, well.  What do you expect?  Yeah, well we got a couple. 
[02:59:00]  Definitely not art  but it's quite funny  for a sequel.  Yeah.  Then we got  Call Me Immoral,  Call Me Insensitive,  Call Me Lewd  but I laughed.  Uh-huh.  So there's a  and that's two of them.  I'll leave the rest alone.  Well, you know  it is what it is.  Yeah.  Alright.  I'm not trying to  it wasn't like  they were putting together  you know  Oscar Contender.  No.  You know what?  That is a good point.  There are a lot of movies  out there that  the critics bashed  and I ended up liking.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm sure  Used Cars  didn't get good reviews  when it was in the theaters  but it's one of the 
[02:59:30]  fucking funniest movies ever.  Exactly.  I'm sure it's going to be  better than Broken Flowers  by the new  freaking Bill Murray movie.  Why did you see that?  Dude, how many films  have you done?  You've done like  three movies since then  haven't you?  Yeah.  Irish Jam.  Let's see.  I did Proconviction's  Irish Jam.  All these back to back to back.  It's like after  Deuce Bigelow's number four  on the filmography  and there's three above it.  How much do you work?  I did one line  in Spider-Man  and I'm still waiting  for like  my fucking phone to ring.  I've got nothing going on. 
[03:00:00]  Got a good agent  I'm just working, man.  I hear you, Eddie.  I hear you.  All right, man.  Well, we are big fans  of your work.  Here, we've got to let you go.  We think you're  a very funny guy.  Good luck with  the Deuce Bigelow  and the Richard Pryor  and everything else  you do there.  All right.  Appreciate it, guys.  All right.  Take care, man.  There he goes.  Eddie Griffin.  The new movie opens  nationwide today.  Deuce Bigelow  European Gigolo.  All right.  Yeah, I guess when you  make a movie  that gets panned like that,  what are you going to do?  Right. 
[03:00:30]  Some people find it funny.  We've got to get  Howie Mandel in here.  Let's say hi to  Brian in Virginia.  Brian.  Yeah, hey, guys.  Hey.  I barely fucking hear you.  All right.  Listen, just wanted to say,  first of all,  my wife got me  XM for Christmas  and I'm going to be  honest with you,  I was just going to  hang on to it  until Howard went  over to Sirius.  Yeah.  But you guys got me  fucking hooked,  so I told her,  don't worry about  wasting money  for Christmas.  Get me Sirius.  I'm sticking with you guys.  Thank you, Brian.  I appreciate it.  Got the virus,  especially because 
[03:01:00]  I live here in Virginia  and I got a list,  we got fucking  douchebag Don Geronimo on,  so.  Well, leave the guy alone.  He's had a tough month.  Yeah, this is shitty.  Yeah, I understand that.  I swear to God,  I was going to call in  and bust his balls,  but I guess you got to  have some sympathy somewhere.  All right, let me explain  what's going on.  Howie Mandel  just walked into the studio,  but we're in the middle  of a subject,  so maybe Howie  can jump in  and then we'll get  to what you're up to  as well, okay?  I'd love to jump in.  All right, Brian,  you're going to explain  Life Aquatic?  Well, you know what?  I was going to try to,  but you kind of closed  on a note that I just, 
[03:01:30]  just to tie it in  with Eddie's movie  that just came out.  I think people got to  remember sometimes  that you're there first  to be entertained  with the movie.  Life Aquatic,  to put it in,  sum it up like this,  they're trying to goof  on Jacques Cousteau's life.  Well, I get that.  Right.  Now, other than that,  it's kind of like  Napoleon Dynamite.  I know people that saw that  and said,  I don't get what they're doing.  Love it.  It's just a bunch of losers.  And I'd say,  if you like Napoleon Dynamite,  you're going to like Life Aquatic. 
[03:02:00]  Man, maybe I should rent that again  and give it another shot.  I don't know.  I thought the character  development was great.  I thought the characters  were very original and stuff,  but I don't know.  Yeah, I mean,  I don't think they're trying  to split the atom.  I don't think there's some  deep underlying spiritual meaning  to Life Aquatic.  I think it's just supposed to be  a goof with these characters  who are obviously all losers,  or most of them are anyway.  Right.  And that's kind of like  Napoleon Dynamite,  Big Lebowski, same thing.  You're just watching  a bunch of losers  go through a mission.  Right.  All right. 
[03:02:30]  All right, man.  Punch it out.  Take care, guys.  Thank you.  One more here.  Eric in California.  Go ahead, Eric.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, man.  I just want to let you know  with Life Aquatic,  it's just supposed to be  one of those movies  where you're like,  what the fuck?  What the hell's going on  where it changes around  and everything's all bizarre?  But, oh, seriously, man.  You're always saying  that shit sucks.  And it's bumming me out.  Like, you were talking about  how Fred and Deep Tracks  are just awful stations  because they go too far, right? 
[03:03:00]  Yeah, well, that's just my taste.  That's all.  I don't want you to...  You don't have to agree  with what I say.  I'm just...  So, Life Aquatic,  the purpose was to say  what the fuck's going on.  That's what they were going for?  That's what you got out of it?  Yeah.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, it's Howie.  It's just a weird movie.  It's just a weird movie where...  I know, but you're right.  You don't...  A lot of people don't go...  A lot of...  You know, I've been involved  in some films  and I never thought of that.  To go for the audience  saying, you know,  how the fuck is this? 
[03:03:30]  Well, that's what I was thinking  when I found out.  The fuck am I doing it?  But I watched it over and over again.  Right.  You've got to watch it over again  so you can keep saying,  what the fuck did I watch it  the second time for?  Three fucking times  I watched this fucking piece of shit.  I don't know what the fuck this is.  A lot of people don't go...  That's a niche.  And you...  He's right.  You're right.  And I love that about it.  Hey, but, oh, man,  the, uh...  As for the deep tracks  and the Fred,  like, isn't there  the whole point  of satellite radios  to go, like, beyond  what commercial radio's doing? 
[03:04:00]  Like, of course,  it's great that they're playing  creative.  Yes, it is.  Relax.  Don't hold yourself, would you?  Yeah, I mean, Eric,  you've got to understand this show.  We spew our nonsense.  You don't have to agree with it.  We're just giving our opinions  and stuff.  I personally don't like  deep tracks and Fred  because I think they go too deep.  And I think if you bring it in  a little bit  and play some more familiar stuff,  I would be happier.  You've got to miss the point.  I think the point of this  particular show  is for you to listen to it  and think,  what the fuck is this?  Yeah, exactly.  That is pretty much it. 
[03:04:30]  I got to tell you, Howie.  Is this for me?  No.  That's just in case  somebody comes in.  I have one.  That's if Jimmy,  which he does,  he gets nervous  and you've got to float loose  and you've got to spray  because he stinks.  Cans of Lysol.  Yeah.  Cans of Lysol  and disinfecting wipes.  I don't know if you know.  Well, that's what  we're going to get into it.  We've got the hand thing.  I hear you have some issues.  Anthony definitely has some issues.  I don't have issues.  I have issues.  I get skeeved out sometimes.  I have some OCD in my family,  so I guess I have some issues myself. 
[03:05:00]  I'm being kind  with having what they call issues.  What is it if I don't want  to shake someone's hand  after they come out of the bathroom?  That's not an issue.  That's kind of gross.  I love it.  I love the whole,  I wish I was like,  the whole Asian thing  I wish would take over the planet.  I want to bow.  You just want to put your hands together?  Hands together and bow.  There's no reason to touch your...  What's with the touching?  I don't like touching.  I hate touching.  I won't touch anyone.  I don't like when people take pictures  and they're like,  hey, dude,  and they get close,  like, stay away.  I have no reason to touch anyone. 
[03:05:30]  No touching.  You've got to see the shot I took.  How does it mean I remember?  We did Tough Crowd together  and this is the picture  he and I have together.  Standing, uh...  Arms behind your back.  That's good.  That's like...  That's one of my favorite shots.  Don't touch.  Yeah, both of us just standing  with our arms behind our back,  staring at me.  Very awkward photo, you guys.  It's a picture.  Well, we're close,  yet we're not touching.  Right.  Yes.  And is anyone going to believe  that your buddy's enough  with, you know,  Robert De Niro,  if you get a picture with him,  that he's going to put his arm around you  and that's how you walk down the street  because you're taking a picture  and he's got his arm around you? 
[03:06:00]  You don't need to.  You just need him in the frame.  I always joke and say,  you know,  it's time for us to make believe  we are friends  and then they take the photo.  Yeah, but even friends.  When have you assumed  there's no camera around?  I know what you're going to say.  I've known Anthony for 10 years.  Never a hug.  Not even a hug.  You know the pose  where you stand beside somebody  and you put your arm around them  and you face the camera?  Aside from when there's a camera,  have you ever just stood like that  with Anthony?  You're the best friend  you would never do that.  Just put your arm around me  and let's just stand here  and just enjoy the moment.  It never happens.  It's a stupid picture.  Everybody's got that picture. 
[03:06:30]  You're absolutely right.  At a urinal,  it's acceptable.  That's the only time  your friends there  are having trouble,  maybe prostate problems,  you put your arm around them  and you walk them through it.  That's the only time  it's allowed to be done.  You've walked your friend  through a prostate problem.  Absolutely.  You're just standing  with your arm around them,  two men talking,  getting to know each other,  a little medical help.  No problems.  How are you?  Can you explain  what's going on with you?  You got like the OCD  or what?  I have OCD.  You do?  And germs is just one part of it.  You're freaked out by germs?  No.  No, I have OCD.  Do you know what OCD is?  Yeah, my mom has it really bad.  I have it pretty bad. 
[03:07:00]  OCD is obsessive compulsive disorder  so you get a thought in your head,  weird thoughts in your head  and it doesn't go away.  And one of the thoughts,  like if I shake hands,  I haven't shaken anybody's hand  for a couple of years.  A couple of years?  A couple of times,  you know, I'll do it  or the other day  somebody grabbed my hand  and I'll do it  and I actually ended up  being okay  but sometimes I don't know  if I'll end up okay.  And then for the rest of the day,  I have images of,  you know,  shit on my hands  and I'll go and I'll wash,  I'll scald my hand  and then I come out 
[03:07:30]  back to wherever I was  and then I can't even  hear people talking.  I'm focused on my hands.  Even though I washed  and I know logically  that I got the hand clean  and then I'm focused on my hand.  I go back in  and I scald it again  and I come out  and I'll wash my hands  up to like 30, 40 times  after somebody...  Oh, man.  Yeah, and my hotel room  is like nuts with...  You know, I'm here in New York  and I'm staying in the hotel room  and it takes me about  two and a half hours  to prepare my room  so that I'm comfortable.  I make paths  with the towels. 
[03:08:00]  That's what we've heard.  Yeah, I order a lot of towels  and I'll make paths  so I don't have to touch  the carpet to all  the different places  I know that I'm going to go  and I remove the...  What makes the carpet  between the towels  better than the carpet  outside the towels?  Like, I can understand  if you just built the house  brand new,  you could know  that that was clean  but I mean,  if you're in a hotel,  the carpet between the towels  is probably just as bad  as the carpet outside the towel.  I don't...  No, the carpet's not...  Did they shampoo the room  as each person leaves?  No, I don't think.  He doesn't touch the carpet. 
[03:08:30]  I don't touch the carpet.  Oh, no.  I thought you were  leaving out a path.  You actually stand on the towels.  Yeah, I have...  All right, that makes sense.  Now that makes sense.  That makes perfect sense.  See?  So I've got towel paths  wherever I go.  Okay.  You and I seem to...  I like it.  ...sympatico.  But why are the towels okay?  Because they're clean.  They're like white bleach.  They're bleached.  Hot water.  I'm okay.  I don't know.  Don't give me another...  Did you really...  Don't make them think about this shit  any more than he asked them.  Someone said you shaved your head  because you were uncomfortable  with this shit.  I actually shaved my head  originally for a film 
[03:09:00]  and then I realized  this feels like cleaner.  It feels clean.  So I keep it shaved now  because anything to feel cleaner  and not infested  with whatever you could  possibly be infested with.  Now, obviously people say,  well, the compulsive hand washing  is like deep-seated  trying to get rid of problems.  I mean, I'm sure you've heard  all that stuff a million times.  I'm in therapy.  Oh, you are in therapy.  And I'm supposed to be medicated.  I don't take the medication.  Oh, really?  No.  My mom has tried it all.  It is a nightmare on earth, man.  What's her thing?  It's bad. 
[03:09:30]  She has thoughts  that she's killing people  and she's convinced  she's killing people  and she'll see a story in the paper  and she wants to go down  to the police station  and turn herself in.  I mean, it's brutal stuff.  But like you said,  she knows it's dumb.  Right.  She knows she's not crazy  but she can't get  the actual thought out of her head.  You know, it's like  you have a CD that skips.  You know, you get this...  I think everybody has  these weird, bizarre thoughts  going through their heads.  You know, you see a story.  You see something horrible,  a horrible thought,  a crazy thought  and it just goes by  and nobody thinks about it.  And what happens is  our minds get stuck 
[03:10:00]  on that thought  and it keeps repeating  and repeating  and repeating.  And it's...  You know, I make fun of it  but it's pretty horrible  a lot of the time.  How many times  are you going to lock  the door and stuff  before you leave?  You know, I've done it  up to maybe 20 times.  I've gone into my car  and I go,  oh, I didn't lock the door  and I go back up  to the apartment  and I'll check the door  and shake the handle  and it's locked.  I go back to the car  and then I go,  oh, I probably didn't  shake it enough  and I go back to the car  and I shake it again.  But you're down at the car  and you absolutely know  it's going to be locked  when you go up there.  You know, I have shaken 
[03:10:30]  the door handle  shaken the door handle  then bang,  like punched the door handle  so I'll feel the pain  in my hand  so that when I go down  to the door  I go,  I know that I shook it  and punched it  so I'll feel the pain  but maybe I knocked it loose  so I'll go back up  and I'll do it again  and you can't get that.  Are you just late  to everything?  It doesn't always happen.  No, I guess it's correct.  I get that one  every once in a while.  Usually when I'm tired  I'll have to keep coming back  to my apartment  like, alright, it's locked,  okay, and then I'll walk down  the end of the block  and go,  exactly how you just explained it. 
[03:11:00]  You know, so it's not a fun thing  but I deal with it  and I'm able to function  but I thought you guys  put out all this.  For you?  No, it's because he farts  through the whole show.  I hope you have no problems  with farting  because if you do  you might as well leave right now.  Well, I do  but it's not an issue.  It's not a Purell  I'm not allowed to use anymore.  Why?  You know what happened?  I did, in 1998  I got a daytime talk show.  Paramount gave me  a daytime talk show  and they sat down  with me and said 
[03:11:30]  the only thing  that I really have an issue with  and they said  we can't have you focus  on the whole germ thing  and guests come on  and they want to shake hands  and they want to  so you've got to shake their hands  and I go, okay  because this is the daytime audience  the ladies are home  during the day  and they like a good handshake.  Yeah, and you can't  just talk about  how fucked up you are  and so I said  okay, I'll do it  and you've got to wear a suit  and you've got to shave  and you've got to take out  the earrings  and you've got to look like  I guess Maury Povich.  Right.  They wanted a Maury Povich.  So I went on 
[03:12:00]  but I called my friend  who's a surgeon  and I was using Purell  like crazy.  My hands are totally soaked  in Purell all the time.  My friend's a surgeon.  I said, you know,  what's that stuff  before you go into the OR?  I see you guys scrubbing that  like you scrub  and he got me.  I got cases of that stuff.  So before every show  I would scrub up on my hands  and then behind my desk  I had Purell  and then I would shake  everybody's hand  and I had Purell  and then I would scrub  after the show  and I had this thing  and the show lasted  for about eight months.  I also don't open doors. 
[03:12:30]  I do, you know,  I push it with the side  of my hand.  I'll push it.  I don't use doorknobs  and I find different ways  and I found like  wherever I was pushing  the doors  I started getting  I got these warts  and that just blew my  I didn't know what it was  and I go to the dermatologist  and he goes,  you got warts  and I go,  how would I get  How the hell?  Well, here's what happened.  I killed all the antibodies  in my hands  so I was getting  warts are just viruses  so I would start getting  viruses in my hands  because my hands  were so antiseptic 
[03:13:00]  You killed all the good stuff  that's in there  to kill the bad stuff.  I killed everything  so I'm not allowed to use  I don't use Purell  I don't use  and if you went  I don't want you to  but if you saw me  in a public restroom  it's like  fucking Cirque du Soleil  I can do  I can do things  with my feet  and I can twist things  and I can contort  so that I  I would rather explode  than go into a public restroom  but when I get there  I can do things  without using hands  Now, people have goofed on me 
[03:13:30]  in the public restroom  because I use the bathroom  and I'll wash my hands  and I'll use the paper towel  but then I'll use the paper towel  to open the door with  and then hold the door  at my foot  and throw the paper towel  into the garbage  so I haven't touched anything  after my hands  There's actually a logical reasoning  They've done studies  They do find like  flecks of shit  I mean, that's not lunacy  in a public restroom  to not want to touch something  Who found flecks of shit?  They've done studies  on like doorknobs  Well, not even doorknobs  you know, they say  in the restaurants  in the mints  Yeah, that's what I was going to say  in the mints  Urine 
[03:14:00]  Yeah, they found little  you know, just microscopic  so that's not complete crazy  We're over at the Parker Meridian  and we're having lunch  and I have to use the bathroom  Now you need a key  I won't use it there  because the key  You need the restaurant key  Right  So we got the key  Now she gives me the key  and I go to the bathroom  and everything's fine  and then I realize  wait a minute  this key is being held  by people who don't  wash their hands  when they go to the bathroom  I don't even think that  See, I was at the Parker Meridian  and I went across the street  to the Starbucks  and I pissed at the Starbucks  No, see, but you know what I did  What?  I then took my hands 
[03:14:30]  and the key  and the soap  and washed everything  You washed the key  I washed my hands  and the key  and then I rinsed everything off  dried it  so now I'm carrying back  a key that's been washed  and gave it back  I fucking took the key  and I scooped it  into my oatmeal  and I ate off it  Who fucking cares?  I'm the same  What do you think?  Hatch a cold?  Big deal  I don't like  I don't like  1988  Who gives a shit?  Don't make Howie leave  No, I'm not  I love Howie  We're also a really good story  I don't like bathroom stuff  I understand the mentality 
[03:15:00]  but it doesn't work that way  for me for that  See, I'm not  I'm not as far  as you have gone  but I like  I don't like the bathroom stuff  You're not as far  You washed the fucking key  I washed the key  Even Howie thinks  You're dirty  I gave the key back  and I never gave it  a second thought  Howie  That is true  You key washing motherfucker  You know  we gotta get into  what Jimmy does  on the side  cause that  would  that has to  just  What?  It would freak Howie out 
[03:15:30]  Oh, just the disgusting  sex  I don't even know  Howie go down this road  Go down it  It would just be  very interesting  What do you do?  He lets attractive women  after he puts plastic down  on his bathroom floor  squat over him  and piss on him  I've been tangled  Piss is antiseptic though  Howie  Oh yeah  What would  what would that do to you  you think?  You know what's funny  he let some strange chick  piss all over you  but you put plastic  down on the floor  cause God forbid  some should get on the pile  I'm a neat freak 
[03:16:00]  He's very piss on me  but don't mess up  my fucking tile  And then we had  a stripper come in  or dance  or whatever the fuck  Oh she was sexy man  She came in  she had spit on the window  here and licked it  and I was just  completely skeeved out  I was skeeved on that one  She comes in  and they start talking  about spit  and Jimmy asked her  to spit in his mouth  and he opened his mouth  she leaned over him  and spit in his mouth  much to everyone's disgust  Oh it was hot man  It was not hot  it was disgusting  It's a kiss 
[03:16:30]  It is not a kiss  It is a kiss  It's a saliva transfer  It's not a kiss  Without that annoying  intimacy  Who wants eye contact  How do you deal  with intimacy?  You know  I'm intimate  with myself  Yeah well  that's always good  Yeah because I know  where I've been  Right  But I've been with  the same girl  for almost 30 years now  Wow  Who I have  hermetically sealed  She's  you know my wife  but she knows  the rituals  She knows  she cleans up 
[03:17:00]  and then I said  are you clean?  I'm coming in  Does the family  ever resent it  like because you know  it's ritualistic stuff  it's like  and did they ever  just go  fucking enough  like do they ever  resent having to do  things a certain way  Because I have children  I've always maintained  that you know  dad's sick  and don't be like that  so you know  I know that  for their health reasons  and because I'm  a responsible parent  that don't  but my wife  gets mad at me  because my son  when my son was  I'll tell you  I've had like  horrible potty training  story  I had one with  my daughter  my daughter  my first daughter  my daughter's like  21 now 
[03:17:30]  but when she was  when she was  young  I guess how old  are you when  you're potty training  you're almost  two years old  depends on the chromosomes  right  but she's  my wife was really  into the potty training  you know  and read all the books  and you have to  you know  after she pees  or shits  you know  we all had to applaud  and everybody was around  it's a big deal  she's just about  potty training  and my wife says  I was going out one day  and she says  you take her  you take her with you  so I have this baby  in the car seat  and she's just a little girl  a little baby  and we're out someplace 
[03:18:00]  and she says to me  dad I have to  I have to go potty  and you know  my heart  I get heart palpitations  I'm thinking  I can't go in a public restroom  I can't sit her down  and where am I going to take her  I can't go in the men's room  and I don't want her to sit down  I mean I can't go in the ladies room  I don't want her to sit down  in the men's room  so I said  honey  you know  can you  can you hold it  is there any way to hold it  and she goes  it's a little baby  you know the baby  yes  she goes  I'll try daddy  because she could see the horror  in my eye  she goes  I'll try  I'll try dad  so I 
[03:18:30]  I put her in the car  and I put her in the car seat  and we're driving down  the Ventura Freeway  I live in Los Angeles  we're driving down  the Ventura Freeway  and she goes  from the back seat  I hear daddy  I can't  I can't hold it  I go okay honey  we'll pull off here  we'll pull off here  and we'll go to the gas station  she goes  no I can't  I go okay okay fine  so we pull over to the side of the freeway  the side of the Ventura Freeway  this public freeway  and I pull out  and there's like hedges  on the side of the freeway there  so I get her out  I unbuckle her from the car seat  and I put her in my arm  and I go over to the hedges  and I take one step over to the hedges 
[03:19:00]  and I don't realize it's a gully  it's a ravine  oh my god  so I step  and I slip on my back  I fall on my back  and I start hurtling down this mountain  down the side of the Ventura Freeway  and I'm holding the baby  I'm coddling her on my side  she's screaming  I'm yelling  the twigs are breaking  there's mud  my pants rip  it cuts my ass  and I end up at the bottom of this gully  in this horrible  like infested kind of wet puddle  and I'm bleeding  and I'm in this gully 
[03:19:30]  and I'm holding the baby  and she's crying  and I kind of stand up  and I hold her in front of me  and she goes  I gotta go  I gotta pee  I go okay  alright  and I look  my wife had put her in some sort of  like a jumpsuit kind of thing  so I unbuckle the thing  and I pull it down around her ankles  and I'm holding her up by the armpits  in front of me  and I go  okay honey  go go  and she goes  I can't  I'm gonna pee on my pants  I'm gonna pee  because her legs are down below  and this is the first daughter  I've never really  you know I grew up with brothers  and everything  I said okay  alright  just put your feet up on my shoulders  up on my neck 
[03:20:00]  I'm holding her in front of me  like face to face  put your feet up on my neck  and then I figure  you know  your legs are out toward me  and then you'll pee down into this  if your cop saw this  you'd be shot by the way  right  so her feet are up on my neck  and I go  okay go  well I didn't know  that it seems like  with the vagina  that the  whatever way your feet are aiming  is what way the  the fluid goes  so she goes  and then all of a sudden  it's  in my face  she's pissing  in my face  my fucking mouth  in my mouth 
[03:20:30]  I'm screaming  like a woman  my ass is bleeding  I'm standing in a puddle  this is for a guy  who didn't want to go  into a public bathroom  and I start to scream  and she's screaming  and it's all over her clothes  and she goes  I got it on my clothes  her fucking clothes  it's in my fucking mouth  so I'm trying to be a good dad  and I take off her  the bottom of her pants  and now she's naked  and my hands are covered  in the mud  and the blood  so now it's all over her  and I'm filled with piss  she's filled with piss  and I try to climb the hill  now I'm climbing the hill 
[03:21:00]  and it's mud  you know  and I get up like five steps  and then I slide back down the hill  and she's crying  and I'm almost crying  and I can't breathe  and you know my heart  I think I'm going to have a heart attack  finally after  it seems like an eternity  I get up on top  on the freeway  and I come through the hedges  like 500 feet  from where my car is  and I'm standing there  and I'm bleeding  and I'm covered in mud  and she's crying  and there's piss  and there's blood  and a car slows down  and I got a naked little girl  out of the hedges  and the car slows down 
[03:21:30]  and pulls down his window  and goes are you Howie Mandel  and I said no  get the fuck out of here  no  and we get into the car  my wife is waiting  my wife has never let me  take the  I don't really take the kids out  anymore  no I wouldn't let you either  that's  what a horrific story  oh I hate when that happens  oh  yeah  fuck  that is horrid  that's  welcome to my life  wow  yeah  do you ever feel guilty over it  like the fact that the family  has to kind of do stuff  cause like sometimes 
[03:22:00]  you have like those moments  where you're like  Jesus Christ man  my obsession  is causing other people's lives  to be shifted  yeah my son  the first time he  he went to  he has to go to the  men's room alone  and you know  I think he was like  four or five  and he came out  it was in the middle of a  California pizza kitchen  which is this chain out there  he walks out  and it's packed  and he goes  I went by myself  and I didn't touch anything  and my wife just  turned to me  and went  fuck you  fuck you started  you know  wow  but I work  as hard as I do 
[03:22:30]  on trying to keep myself germ free  I work on telling them  that this is not the way to live  how old were you  when it kicked in  or was it your whole life  you know what  I didn't realize it was my whole life  I have a younger brother  who when I was seven years old  would just  we didn't  a lot of brothers fought physically  he would just hold the lid  to the laundry hamper  and it would scare me  and everybody thought  it was kind of funny  and weird  you know  and I would never  I would always wrap up  my own laundry  and I had my own little  rituals  and counting things  and doing things  but nobody knew  what it was then  you know  I've been around 
[03:23:00]  for a long time  so why not the medication  before we move on  because  after all these stories  life is great  right  actually my life  is great  you know  I have a functioning  relationship  with three kids  you know  I'm working  and I like  I don't want it  to take the edge  off of whatever  you know  until I feel  that I can't function  or the people around me  are really  being inhibited  by what I do  then I will  do you notice  it getting better  or worse  or staying the same  it goes in ebbs and flows  there's sometimes  when I'm  and probably you'll notice 
[03:23:30]  that with your mother  you know  there are times  when it's just not bad  and you wouldn't know  and I don't know  if stress brings it on  I don't know  what brings it on  you know  they're starting  to connect it to  there's a study  in California  that connects it to  strep  you know  I had a lot of ear infections  when I was a little baby  and they're saying  that strep  whatever that virus is  because it's physiological  it's not a  it's supposed to be  a physiological problem  I think it's like  some sort of chemical  problem  chemical imbalance  wow  the ability to not let  a thought go 
[03:24:00]  whatever it is  some days my mom  is completely normal  and it's like  and then she goes back  to you know  just you know  just  the scariest thing  about it  is when you have  those freak outs  and you know  you know  you know  it would be better  if you didn't know  that what you're thinking  is  is  psycho  you know  but you're so aware  and cognizant  that what you're thinking  is  is psycho  yeah  which makes you  even more psycho  you go  I know this is ridiculous  yeah  but  isn't it amazing  that  you know  somebody who's a comic 
[03:24:30]  now it's your job  to get up on stage  and make people laugh  and  you know  nobody  nobody's the wiser  and  and  it's got to be difficult  in some situations  to get up there  and be funny  when you're just  either horrified  or freaking out  or whatever  and  yeah it is  but and also  you know I'm doing  I'm doing a new show  I'm doing a new show  on  and this is not a segue  to promote the show  oh it's okay  we can move on  anyway  no I'm not moving on  what I'm saying  no what I'm saying  is I got the show  on Bravo  I do like these  hidden camera pieces 
[03:25:00]  and that's what I'm doing  and premieres  August 18th  very good  at 11 o'clock  on Bravo  but a big part of it  it's a half reality  and half  a big part of it  is I decided to  to do  my real life  so a big part of it  is showing the OCD  and my germ phobias  and all that  and what I have found  the fact that I talk  about it publicly  you know  when I go out  and people have  listened to this show  they'll walk out  and they'll go  hey Howie  how you doing  I heard you  I heard you  on the radio today  I'm not going  to shake your hand  it just makes  my life easier  and makes my world 
[03:25:30]  easier if I do it  on television  if I talk about it  on the radio  it's kind of  yeah  I used to not  talk about it  they still understand  and they won't think  you're just a dick  you know  because you're not  shaking their hand  most people are  angry  you know I started  I used to go out  I used to go out  and band it  we do fists  that's what I do  that's how I came  into that  that's how I came  and I'll do the fist  but I used to  before I came to that  I used to  I would put a band-aid  I would put a band-aid  on my hand  and they'd go  they'd extend their hand  to shake it  and then I'd go  look  I got a band-aid  so then they would go  then they'd extend 
[03:26:00]  the other hand  all of a sudden  everybody's into  like a left-handed  I don't do left-handed shakes  right  so then what I did  is I put a band-aid  on the right hand  and I put a band-aid  on the left hand  bizarre clapping  then they'd go  what happened  then you had to  come up with  then I had a sling  then I had two slings  then I had  it's just bizarre  you're giving Anthony ideas  oh I love this  you know  now I just go OCD  but it's still the thing  with the fist  I do the fist  yeah  you know  and some people  they don't know what to do  like I'll extend  just do this  and then people  will just grab your fist 
[03:26:30]  is that why you have  rings on the end too  just to kind of  keep the thing  you would probably  want to use four rings  to stop the things  from touching  you're right  I didn't think of that  now the rings  are big rings over there  yeah I got rings  keeps it away from my flesh  but people don't know  what to do with the fist  and then you'll do it  to like you know  a black guy  will come up to you  and I'll you know  I'll give the fist  and then they  they think  I gotta tell them  it's not like a BET thing  it's an OCD thing  it's not a  because then they want  to grab hands  they think I'm just trying  to be  no when you extend the fist  sometimes they think  you're trying to be like hip 
[03:27:00]  you know  and you got the whole  then you got a whole thing  you gotta do  yeah they touch the end  of the fist  and they bop you  on the top of the fist  all of a sudden  you're doing  ink a bink a bottle of ink  the cork fell out  thing fong fooey  how do you remember that  no  what  the inky binky thing  ink a bink a bottle of ink  the cork fell out  and you stink  not because you're dirty  not because you're clean  just because you kissed  the girl behind the magazine  stand  and you are not  at  eeny meeny miny moe  catch a  fella  well we know how that  catch a fella  hey um 
[03:27:30]  now let me  Jessica Simpson  comes up to you right now  and says  I have to blow you  oh  I know you're married  you wouldn't do it  but let's just  I'm talking  right  no no no no  right  I have to blow you  where does shaking hands  come into that  no no but I'm  no but I have no problem  with that  alright let's seal the deal  let's shake  don't shake his hand  well then I can't  then I can't hate that  I can't have the blowjob  look anyone who stuck my cock  that's fine  but get off my hands  it's true  that's where my issue is  it's just my hands  what about him and pussy 
[03:28:00]  going down  what about me  it's fine with you  it's the same girl  over 30 years though  it's like  yeah I don't want to  bring his wife into this  no no but I'm saying  would it bother you  if it was somebody  who didn't know  to give head  a woman  if you were single right now  and a girl wanted you  to go down on her  right  what would this  would go through your mind  I don't know  I don't know  it's a good thought though  I don't know  my issue is my hands  I don't know why  I don't know why  I have that  it doesn't make any sense to me  but my issue  it's most of the hands  would you go down on her 
[03:28:30]  if you met her  when she walked out  of a Port Authority bathroom  and she had paper  trailing from the back of the house  that wouldn't be  if she had walked out  of your place  I would be more  because I know  she had just pissed  all over you  I've seen Howie on Regis  many times  I don't see Regis  asking these questions  no this is a lot different  why are you  washing your hands  so much  angry Regis  I like this  I like this  this is a lot  no I have no issues  with  I have no issues  with any other  I have other issues  besides shaking hands 
[03:29:00]  but not with  not with germs  you're afraid  as a comedian  of the medication  kind of affecting  the brain  yeah  he makes a great point  with losing the edge  that's very interesting  you see people  who are like  Paxol  or whatever they're on  you know these guys  in the business  they always get that  white shit  in the corner of their mouth  and they're just so neutral  about everything  and they really are  man  they have no  anger  and no happiness  they're just kind of  talking like that  you gotta wonder  how's that better  level down  absolutely  but when you hear  all the side effects  of every kind of medication 
[03:29:30]  you wonder why  it's better for  these people  I guess for some people  it is better  because if you can't  deal with it  in your own mind  what's the alternative  I'm neurotic  are they talking about me  are they talking about  some guy came in  told another guy a secret  really  it was funny  I watched how he looked  he looked to the right  no they just do that  because we're on air  because they are assholes  what was the secret  you told them  what was the secret  what did you say  well we're just setting up something  we're going to bring in  someone that's very sick  and they're going to just  start coughing all over the place  and we want to see 
[03:30:00]  are you a crazy person  OB  he'll come in  he stays on that computer  and he'll come in  it's totally cool  we're just messing with you  it's nothing  all of a sudden  a guy comes in  coughing and sneezing  right  I saw the aristocrats  yes  you're in there  and you shocked me  with the c word  well there are two words  that's what I love  about this movie  and I can't believe  I'm just saying the c word  because we're on satellite  no but there are two words  the two words that the female 
[03:30:30]  that any woman hates most  are number one  the c word  and number two  cunt  right  yeah those are them  yes I think those are them  I think that's the end of the list  that's what I love about the aristocrats  I think it's a great movie  and getting rave reviews  so they don't need my help  but all you guys going  and just showing a little bit  of yourselves  I think on the DVD  they're going to show  the whole  you know I think they sat  with each one of us  for over an hour  and we told it  and they decided  I guess my little  little portion 
[03:31:00]  and was the  I said cunt a lot  yeah  I heard there were  certain comedians  that wouldn't curse  and I guess look  you got to be true  to what you do  but then there's a certain  thing  there's got to be  a certain camaraderie  as comics  where it's like  yes we're telling  a dirty joke  I don't care if you're  Cosby or you know  Rita Rudner  it's like everyone  has reveled in a dirty joke  and that's like  what this is  I think part of it's about  there were people  that wouldn't do it  in the aristocrats  yeah I heard  that John Stewart  wasn't that dirty  or I heard  what's your name  Rita Rudner  Rita Rudner wasn't dirty  I heard a couple of them weren't 
[03:31:30]  I think they were  as dirty as they are  you know  I think that John Stewart  was actually pretty funny  someone said he wouldn't do it  he wasn't that dirty  he was kind of like  careful  he didn't  honestly  and I'm a fan of John Stewart  it seemed like he was  very safe  with his presentation  but you don't know  you know the point is  you don't know how long  that's what was edited in  so you don't know  you don't know where it got to  and I thought  well he used to do our show  and it was a lot different  than what he's doing now  is all I'm saying  so John's got a certain image  he's got to uphold these days  that's what we're sort of thinking  he's going to cover Newsweek 
[03:32:00]  yeah  it's almost like that daily show  has become  a real news show  it was a complete parody  of the news  and now  they're saying  a lot of people  are getting their news from it  it's actually throwing  a lot more facts out there  than jokes about news  right  they keep it funny  and entertaining  but you know  I think he's also got  he's kind of getting into that image  of almost an anchor man  Al Franken wants to run  but you know  but also you have to also look at  if you're talking about the aristocrats  you have to look at  you know  they came to us  you know  either Paul Provenza 
[03:32:30]  or Penn Jillette  would call and say  you know the joke  and you guys know the joke  the aristocrats joke  so it's just about being filthy  we're going to talk about the joke  you can do the joke  you can do any twist you want  on the joke  and we'd love you to be part of this  and they would come to wherever  it was most convenient to you  if you look  most of the people  were in their private offices  they were in their houses  they were in their houses  you know  and it was a joke  that really is never really  that often told on stage  it's told amongst your cohorts  with John  John was  he was in his workplace 
[03:33:00]  he was there in the makeup room  and he had the makeup people  you know  so you have to  and it sort of horrified  one of his workers  as he was telling  I thought she was funny  I thought it was funny  I thought he's a good part of the movie  I haven't seen the thing  I just heard  go see it  what you won't think  he's not holding back anymore  and you don't know  maybe when you see  I really  I loved like  Jason Alexander  got really dirty  which was a surprise  Drew Carey  who else  Saget  well Saget  we had him on the show  last week  he was great  he was really funny  oh he's filthy 
[03:33:30]  he's really fast too man  because I had never seen him  I mean I'm doing  I've stabbed since 1990  so I think he was kind of  like in full house  pretty much right around the time I got in  so I never saw him do stand up before  but he is really fucking quick man  not only is he quick  I knew him from  him and I started at the same time  he was  he's just  most of what he does is off the cuff  and it was always filthy  he was always the filthy  edgy comic  they would put him on at night  and he was filthy  so to see him  for us  who started out with him  to see him on full house  that was the  that was weird  that was the joke 
[03:34:00]  and that was weird  and he was doing  he was also a correspondent  for the CBS morning news  before that  he did that  and I think  how can they put Saget  on the morning news  how can they put Saget  with these little girls  how can they put  and now you go see the aristocrats  and you watch this guy  who's talking about  fucking kids in an eye socket  and you go  oh my god  that's the guy from full house  no  that's the guy  that was Saget  that's really him  and that's the guy  that they put on full house  that's the joke  because everyone's now  looking at him like  he went insane  but no  this is his real personality  it's how we'd feel  if Voss got a job 
[03:34:30]  on a TV as a scientist  right  exactly  there you go  did you guys do the  you and Saget  on the young comedian special  was that the same one  no  my young comedian special  I did  I think I did the sixth  on mine was  Seinfeld  right  that was one  and Harry Anderson  and Richard Lewis  it's so cool to watch  those classic  on classic HBO comedy  where they show  the old  specials  old comedy specials  and you're like  holy shit  look at this  and then you'll see  one guy  it's like  wow  he went nowhere  like they'll have 
[03:35:00]  one guy  you never heard  from again  ever  but I think  we had a good  Seinfeld  Richard Lewis  Harry Anderson  and Sean Maury  and Maureen Murphy  who I don't know  where she is now  Maureen Murphy  I've heard her name  around though  Sean Maury  I've never heard of  and the Smothers Brothers  were the host  right  they were funny  in the movie too  yeah they were  I think they were  really funny  the mime was hilarious  the mime was great  I thought Sarah Silverman  just kicked ass  I love the movie  I'm gonna go see it again 
[03:35:30]  actually  nice to see it  getting huge  fucking press too  man  everybody's talking  Bob Saget was just  on CNN  talking about the  aristocrats  and you were on  what you did Regis  you were on TV  this morning  we looked up  and you were  I saw you on Regis  this morning  as we're doing our show  and I'm like  he's not gonna come in here  I wasn't really on Regis  I just went  I sat in the audience  because I'm such a  huge fan of that show  no I was hosting  I was hosting  for the last two days  and then today  I actually sat in  his audience loves you though  that's why I sat with them 
[03:36:00]  the hidden camera stuff  the hidden camera  that's where that all started right  you started doing it for him  Gilman gave me the glasses  I got these glasses  and part of my OCD  is I get obsessed about things  so I carry the glasses  wherever I go  and every day I go out  and I fuck with people  and a lot of them  end up on the Tonight Show  a lot of them end up on Regis  and some of them  just end up in my own  personal collection  but I realized  I was caught  you know  I have restraining orders  to stay away from places  and I've gotten in trouble  and I've been beaten up  and I said  this is a show  for annoying somebody 
[03:36:30]  they don't know it's me  and sometimes they find out  it's me  and they hit me harder  and you're just trying  to wash off  with it  hey I'm having a bill  I'm doing a fuck you  I've never loved you  fucking idiot  with a fucking glove  he's not punching back  he's applying Purell  to his shit  but I realized  I realized  that it was a  you know  maybe there's a show in this  and how it affects  my family  everybody's real  in the show  except my wife  wouldn't be on camera  so Julie Warner  plays my wife 
[03:37:00]  you know  and you see the  effects of these  hidden cameras  how I get ideas  for them  and then what happens  during them  and how they affect  my life after  sounds like a good show  it's on Bravo  you said  11 o'clock  Thursday night  coming Thursday  on the 18th  11 o'clock  Thursday night  watch it  this premiere  a little sneak peek  you bring your own mic  man  because one of the things  that disgusts me  is when you're doing a bit  and you'll breathe  a certain way  and you smell the mic  and that is just  that's revolting  to anybody  do you travel  with your own  no  now 
[03:37:30]  now I will  I wasn't thinking  why are we giving him  I don't have it  to that extreme  at all  and that bothers me  at all  you're letting  strange chicks  piss all over you  I'm just a good egg  at least you're not  like who was that  we used to hear  the stories  was it Danny Thomas  there were stories  oh yeah  laying under a coffee table  yeah  laying under a coffee table  like what a rookie  that's an amateur  yeah  why do you ruin the furniture  that way  but that wasn't piss  no I know  no there have been stories  was it Danny Thomas  I don't know  Jimmy's been known  to take a log  every once in a while  I don't take a log  but if one slips out 
[03:38:00]  what am I going to do  criticize  yeah you peg  you can laugh it off later  you know he's never  you've had a chick  shit on you  no no no  maybe theoretically  maybe it happened once  who knows  look him in the eye  you don't know  that didn't happen  no I don't remember  look him in the eye  you don't remember  how come that happened  I think something happened  it's a shame  he's just covering the shame  no not at all  you let somebody  shit on you  no not at all  no it never happens  you guys are polar opposites  as far as  oh please  no it's probably not  the opposite you think  it just manifests itself  differently  if you touch yourself  each other  the universe would explode
