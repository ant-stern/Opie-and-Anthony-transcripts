<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a discussion about their controversial, unapologetically offensive radio style, contrasting it with the expectation of niceness in radio.  They immediately transitioned to a graphic description of a man with severe facial tumors featured on the Learning Channel, using highly offensive language and playing audio clips of the man.  Similar descriptions of "Tree Man" followed, interspersed with shocked listener feedback.  The hosts then shifted to Britney Spears' release from a mental health facility, Heath Ledger's drug overdose death (detailing the drugs found in his system), and the morbid humor of coffin selection.  A tornado outbreak in Tornado Alley was juxtaposed with a record-breaking New York City temperature, leading to darkly humorous speculation about global warming and the need for a plague to control overpopulation.  A scathing review of *Twister*, filled with offensive language, followed.  A Black History Month segment featured a clip of Tyra Banks delivering a defiant message.  The show continued with a discussion of Roger Clemens' steroid use, focusing on evidence from his trainer, including syringes and blood-stained gauze, and concluded with humorous anecdotes about a request for Elvis Presley's last bowel movement and Ted Williams' cryogenically frozen head.

The next segment started with a comedic parody of a Roger Clemens press conference, where Clemens nervously confessed to steroid use, blaming various parties, including his children and Mike Wallace.  This transitioned into offensive commentary on a video clip (unplayable on radio) showing Michelle Obama's perceived neglect of Stevie Wonder after a fall at a rally, focusing on crude remarks about their appearances and Stevie Wonder's blindness.  A "Man on the Street" segment, featuring intern Ron's awkwardly conducted interviews with New Yorkers about what's wrong with America, followed.  The hosts relentlessly mocked the low audio quality and rambling responses, criticizing Ron's performance.  Interviewees offered opinions on healthcare, the economy, and the presidential candidates (Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John McCain), with the hosts' frequent interruptions and mockery.  A recurring bit involving a fictional "Rock Like Barack" album played throughout, alongside further commentary on the election and the disastrous "Man on the Street" segment. The segment concluded with a Grammy Minute and a news item about unsold Patriots Super Bowl merchandise.

A humorous, stereotypical Black History Month tribute to Michael Dorn (Worf) opened the next segment.  This quickly shifted to a detailed analysis of the 1958 Disney short, "Magic Highway," highlighting its racist undertones and contrasting its accurate technological predictions (larger highway signs, heads-up displays) with absurd ones (nuclear-powered highway construction, self-washing cars). The discussion then turned to a potential staff trade between the Opie and Anthony show and the Ron and Fez show, involving Than, Sam, and Earl, with the hosts engaging in vulgar debate about their value.  The segment concluded with a lengthy, rambling discussion about intern Adam's confession of love for co-worker Jessica.  The hosts, with Jessica on the line, revealed embarrassing details about Adam (shoplifting, Vaseline application between his thighs and legs, a "Cheez-It" sex act), fueling speculation about the genuineness of his actions and Jessica’s reaction.  Highly offensive and sexually suggestive language dominated this section, with no resolution regarding Adam's behavior.  The segment concluded with announcements about upcoming live shows and ONAradio.com.

A segment focusing on intern Adam's seemingly prolonged comedic bit continued the show.  Opie, Anthony, and intern Jess questioned Adam's inconsistent statements about his relationship with Jess, job status, and Zoloft use. His evasive answers and nervous behavior fueled speculation about his motives, ranging from an elaborate prank to underlying mental health issues.  Tangents included Adam's bizarre anecdote about shooting a cashew into his mouth with his penis, attempts to verify his claims via Facebook and a lie detector test, and conversations about other interns.  A phone call with "Gunshot Guy from Philly" and his girlfriend Lynn, who exposed her breasts on air at the hosts’ urging, added to the chaotic segment.  The segment ended with the scheduling of a lie detector test for Adam.


The final segment featured a female guest in the studio engaging in sexually explicit conversation with the hosts.  The guest described her sexual preferences while responding to increasingly explicit questions, her shyness contrasting with the hosts' encouragement and boundary-pushing.  A discussion arose about showing the guest's genitalia on air, resulting in a brief, obscured view. The segment included commercial plugs (Jim Norton's tour dates), discussions of production limitations, and crude banter.  "Steve," who interfered with planned sexual activity, was mentioned. The segment concluded with more sexually explicit dialogue and a phone sex hotline plug with graphic descriptions.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  In the world of Radio Shock Jocks, the biggest are Opie and Anthony.  These people say shocking things that border on offensive in order to entertain their office.  I refuse to sit here and think that radio has to be nice.  Why? Why does radio, out of any other medium, have to be nice?  We are being now held to a standard where we have to be nice and make people feel good?  Go screw!  Radio Bad Boys, Opie and Anthony.  Controversial radio personalities, Opie and Anthony. 
[00:00:30]  Intimidist DJs, Opie and Anthony.  Talk show radio hosts, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Radio Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  Shock Jocks, Opie and Anthony.  A girl gives you a strip club advice, and then you go and see The Little Mermaid the next day.  It's not like I went with a gay guy.  Your girlfriend did, it was you.  This is where entertainment is going.  I think if you were touched inappropriately, it would make it like a quick pop song, like  the Beatles used to do. 
[00:01:00]  The love, love, me, don't.  Yeah.  Shit, freeze!  Tell us what happened.  I had a patient who was a college student and was really, really depressed, and he killed  himself.  It's time for people to understand, these are words.  If you don't like them, turn the dial.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, we gotta jump right into it today.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show. 
[00:01:30]  Phone number 877-212-ON-A.  We got the instant feedback.  That's working nicely.  Uh, but, uh, I don't even know how they get to the instant feedback that we read.  I don't know.  We asked to fix that a while ago, and I really don't know if that ever was fixed.  Mm-hmm.  We are a show without a boss, so.  Yep.  Because there's an instant feedback on onaradio.com, but we don't really read that one.  No.  No.  The one we read is linked to, I think, a website we're not allowed to promote. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Only a select few get that one.  Yeah, this, this all makes sense, right?  Totally.  Whatever.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  Where do we begin?  There's so much to go over today.  Well, I certainly did, uh, destroy my breakfast.  I couldn't eat because of what was being played in the office. 
[00:02:30]  Now, I usually, you know, I could watch anything.  I don't care, uh, for the most part.  And while we're eating in the office, uh, there's not anything too disgusting playing.  Um, but this morning, I, I reached my limit.  Tumor face.  Well, tumor face, yes.  I, I, I came into, uh, work today and I, I had to tell the guys immediately.  Uh, the learning channel is pretty much, uh, PT Barnum. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  In the year 2008.  They find the freaks that are living among us around the world and they do stories on  them and, uh, all into the guys that were learning something because it's the learning  channel.  The learning channel.  Learning is right in the name.  No, it's the freak channel.  Yeah.  You know, you get the, the twins that are connected by their, their skulls and you get like, like  wolf boy.  And, uh, last night they had a man without face.  Go, go to YouTube right now and, uh, type in man without face.  If you're near a computer is your assignment. 
[00:03:30]  Yes.  And we will link this later today on on a radio.com.  So I was bored yesterday.  I, I didn't feel like, uh, learning about politics and this, this dumb presidential race  that is among us.  So I started flipping around the channels for the first time in a while and I stopped on  the learning channel to meet man without face.  How amazing is that Jimmy?  It's awful.  It's so disgusting.  Fan had a great one.  He goes, if he was a Dick Tracy villain, he'd be grape face.  His face looks like a bunch of grapes. 
[00:04:00]  But they're tumors.  Yeah.  And they've, they're so huge on his face that you can't see any facial features.  Is that his wife and kids?  I don't know.  I don't know if, I think he's got a girlfriend.  No way he's got a girlfriend.  Or that's his sister.  I don't know.  I was too distracted by the tumors.  The tumor or the tumors connect to make one big tumor that looks like a face in front  of his face.  Right?  But it's a big goofy face. 
[00:04:30]  Well, it doesn't look like a face, but it's a big blob the size of his, uh, his entire  head that's in front of his face.  I'm trying to describe this.  And the color is, is kind of like liverish.  Yeah.  Reddish, uh, kind of like a liver.  Every minute they're in the house with him, they have to just be looking at him going,  yuck.  Exactly.  How do you eat around him?  I don't know.  You can't.  You think the guy has bad breath?  Who could tell?  It probably gets caught behind the tumors.  You can't wash everything in there. 
[00:05:00]  Like you can't just wash your face and your face is washed.  Yeah.  You got to lift up each individual bumpy tumor and, and Q tip out the, the face tumor  cheese.  Well, the other thing is he has to lift up.  Yeah.  The other thing is enjoy your breakfast, Jimmy.  The other thing he has to lift up this whole mess just to breathe.  Yep.  Cause the, the nasal passages get all clogged up.  So he's got to lift it up and that's gets tiring.  So he kind of, he kind of waits until he has to breathe again and then he lifts it up for 
[00:05:30]  a little while and then drops it down again.  And this thing is amazing.  And the guy was too scared to go to a doctor or, or there was something going on.  I can't even look at that.  You could see one eye poking out of the side, but the rest is, how do you describe it?  Did we describe it?  Okay.  He looks like a Star Wars character.  Like it looks like, yeah, it looks like a guy, the back of his head's normal picture  two ears and a bushel of grapes.  That is literally what he looks like. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Big, just big grapes and plums.  Oh my God.  Just stuck to his face.  So the thing.  All rough and ravaged.  Of course, uh, he doesn't live in, in America cause we got fine, fine, um, medical in this  country.  These people are always somewhere else, man.  Yeah.  Where this, uh, goes on, on, uh, untreated, untreated.  It's disgusting.  Unchecked.  Oh my God.  So he makes a movie about his life because he's so sick of people, you know, running  away.  The people literally run away scared when they see this guy. 
[00:06:30]  He's a Muppet.  Yeah.  So he made a, uh, like a 20 minute movie and then he decided to show the movie in the,  uh, the town square.  So the same people that run away scared will see that he's not an animal and only about  20 or 30 people showed up.  They, they, they, hilarious.  Is that a big premiere party?  Yeah.  He pretty much had a premiere in the middle of town, 20 or 30 people showed up and that  was it.  He was able to tell 20 or 30 people that he wasn't an animal.  The rest of them are still scared, S-less of this guy.  Chasing him with torches. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's what they should be doing.  Pitchforks.  Kill it.  He just wants to be a movie star.  That's all it is.  A movie star.  He makes it like a plot about.  Yeah.  He's saving the world.  He's carrying a nuclear weapon shaped like grapes away from the school.  Yuck.  Yuck.  That's all you want to say.  It's.  Yuck.  It's amazing.  It looks like intestines.  Yes.  It looks like kind of.  Yeah.  I'm trying to like really give the visual to the people out there.  He has a face full of guts.  And you know what? 
[00:07:30]  People are finding it and all I'm seeing on instant feedback.  Chunk one from Pleasant City, Ohio.  He writes, oh my effing God.  And just a ton of exclamation points.  We'll have this linked on onaradio.com later.  We got audio.  You want to hear some audio of this guy?  Yes.  This wasn't how we were going to start today, but I'm flipping around before I went to bed.  Guess who had nightmares all night, by the way?  That's a good thing to doze off to.  And if you're bored, you're at home and you're flipping around, you have nothing to watch,  right?  Just go to the Learning Channel. 
[00:08:00]  And if you got DVR, just look, because in the middle of the night, they get really freaky.  Yep.  With these people.  These circus.  They're circus freaks.  Well, we're not allowed to display them anymore.  I miss the days where you can pay your...  Oh, that guy would have been behind a wall in a tent with some carnival barker just screaming  out, see the amazing Grape Face Man or something.  Yeah, but the do-gooders, you know, they're taking an income away from these people.  That's what they're doing in the end.  This guy would go on tour and make a fortune.  But the do-gooders are like, oh, you can't do that. 
[00:08:30]  You can't display humans that don't look normal.  I don't feel bad for him.  No.  Why?  I don't feel bad for this guy at all.  Oh, you're reading up on him a little bit, Jimmy?  Yes, I am.  What do you got?  What did you learn from the Learning Channel?  A Jehovah's Witness who for decades refused all surgery on his horrific facial disfigurement  has been given hope by a British doctor with new medical technology.  Unwilling to accept a blood transfusion, Jose Rana has allowed this bloody tumor that first 
[00:09:00]  appeared on his lip in adolescence to obliterate almost all of his face.  So he's had opportunities for years and years and years.  So it started with a little thing on his lip?  Yep.  Oh, my God.  A little thing.  Well, you see the picture, the early picture of him?  He looks like, meh, meh, see, meh.  He just got this big, fat lip.  Yeah.  He was a mess to begin with.  Meh.  You know, look at his face.  You know, it didn't do that much damage, this tumor.  Because you see the before picture.  We got the before and after picture. 
[00:09:30]  We'll throw that up on onaradio.com as well.  All right.  Some audio from this fine show I checked out last night.  It's midday, and Jose Mestre is waking up.  So when I wake up, I wash my face.  And then I go back to bed because it's nighttime.  Why bother washing your face?  Wash it with a train. 
[00:10:00]  Why would you wash your face?  What is that really going to do?  Yeah, he's washing his tumors.  Right.  You know, wash your tumors?  You're basically washing the inside of your body.  Ugh, who would do that?  Just there.  I just picture him with, like, if he really did have good hygiene, with a Q-tip, just getting in there.  Yeah.  All the nooks and crannies.  Yeah.  I wash my face.  Then I get dressed. 
[00:10:30]  I go and have breakfast.  Make a snack.  I try to speak as little as possible.  It's because I start dribbling.  Wait, I got it.  Hold on.  We're not doing this, John.  My friend doesn't like you.  I don't like you either.  But he doesn't like to talk because he starts dribbling. 
[00:11:00]  Dribbling.  What does he think?  That's going to turn people off?  Yeah.  Ew.  Right.  Get it?  Yeah.  Swamp thing.  A little drool on the shirt is not really going to hurt your chances with that girl.  That's not really our problem here.  That's not the thing we're really worried about.  It's because I start dribbling.  And sometimes the veins start to come out.  Jose struggles with the simplest of day-to-day tasks as the tumour obscures his sight. 
[00:11:30]  Wow.  You say I'm going to be late for my singing engagement.  I am your father.  Yeah, he sounds like this guy could do a one-man Star Wars act.  He does sound like Darth.  Darth, yuck.  I am your father.  All right.  Well, he has to lift the tumour to eat and drink, people. 
[00:12:00]  I've watched Two Girls, One Cup.  I could eat pudding.  Yeah, yeah.  I cannot eat my breakfast.  Don't worry.  I was eating the bagel.  It's a bagel.  It's not really anything that looks like his face or his tumour.  If you're eating, like, I don't know, blood sausage in the morning, that could be a problem.  And don't worry.  We'll get the bad taste out of your mouth when we talk about how Obama's wife decided not to help Stevie Wonder after he fell on his face.  Oh, my God.  Is that a funny, funny video?  Anyway, all right.  We'll get to that in a bit.  But more from Tumour Face. 
[00:12:30]  Mealtimes are difficult for Jose, as he has to lift the growth to eat and drink.  Here, now.  When I drink, I drink on one side with his skin.  Since he was a teenager, Jose has been losing his face to this life-threatening tumour, smothering his lips, nose, and one of his eyes.  It's about 33 centimeters long and weighs around three kilograms.  His voice when I was playing is perfect. 
[00:13:00]  How much does that weigh?  And can we do the math?  Look, Tumour Face, I just need a little more time.  Is there more audio than talking?  Oh, yeah.  I know.  It's 12 pounds.  The tumor is 12 pounds.  Hey, we don't serve your kind in here.  Sorry, Tumour Face.  You have to leave. 
[00:13:30]  Yes, it is disgusting, R2.  I don't know what the hell it is.  It's frightening me.  I guess it does look like Jabba the Hutt's genitals.  Booey man saying it looks like when Cloverfield was attacking. 
[00:14:00]  Oh.  Yeah.  The little things jump off his face.  Yeah.  You want to hear more?  Of course.  All right.  Please.  All right.  Get rid of that for a second there.  We'll go back to...  Until his voice kicks in.  It's perfect.  Yeah.  As soon as you hear his voice, you got to go there.  He likes to go to a square, you know, the town square, to sit and hang out.  And then he gets really angry when people stare at him. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah.  You know.  Come on.  Dude.  Cut us some slack.  Dude, humans will stare at a mole that's just a little too big.  Of course you're going to stare at this.  In the afternoon, Josie travels into Lisbon to pass time in his favorite place,  the Prasadorosio Square, and watch the world go by.  But some find it hard not to stare.  I get upset because the people, they come here, take a photo, don't say anything, and go. 
[00:15:00]  Think and go.  What do I want?  I want to be able to talk to my friends, talk to everyone, and be able to cure my eyes.  I want to travel, to see what I've not seen.  I want to travel, to see what I've been doing. 
[00:15:30]  Josie's thoughts are interrupted by a member of the public trying to take a picture.  This is not the photo wrecker you're looking for.  Hey, Kevin from Connecticut has a great observation.  The ugly woman with him could use maybe a seven or eight pound face tumor.  Yeah, you don't get any sympathy from this radio show.  That's why we'll never be syndicated to 200 radio stations.  Yeah.  There's just not a huge audience for this crap. 
[00:16:00]  We have no sympathy for this.  By a member of the public trying to take a picture.  Josie's had enough.  He leaves the square with his nephew.  He leaves the square with his nephew.  What do you expect?  Yeah, I mean, come on.  What he should wear, he should wear the biggest, ugliest yellow hat with a flower on it.  Trying to distract him.  You know, we haven't had a Photoshop contest in a while.  We've got a big yellow hat like Sandy Duncan in Roots. 
[00:16:30]  We're going to have to Photoshop some stuff on this guy.  When you see the picture later, if you haven't seen it already, oh my goodness.  Yeah, it is.  One more clip.  It's like he threw up his insides.  So he's in the town square, someone's taking a picture, and he gets very upset, and he leaves, and he goes home.  Upset by the day's events, Josie becomes angry and frustrated. 
[00:17:00]  He's trying to prove he's not invisible.  Feels that people see only his condition, and not the man behind the face.  That night, Josie explains his frustrations to his sister, Guido.  Stay on target.  Almost there.  Han Solo. 
[00:17:30]  He's saying that there are days where he feels sad and annoyed.  Days?  If it wasn't that end in Y.  He would get a knife and cut it off, because he gets so desperate.  It's for fun.  Yeah.  Wow.  I like the fact that he has days that he's sad and annoyed.  Yeah.  That's as bad as it gets.  I know.  Mild irritation.  He's on his period. 
[00:18:00]  He feels fat.  The second you find your mouth, put a shotgun barrel in it.  He goes to blow his brains out.  He shoots his ear off.  Oops.  He dribbles into the barrel.  Wets the shell.  It doesn't go off.  That's his life.  Every Christmas is torture.  Another hockey mask. 
[00:18:30]  David W. from Jersey City writes,  Star Wars, Revenge of the Sith.  Oh, we can make money off this guy.  Get him to America.  Here's him just talking.  Look, I know, Greedo.  This is so bad for him. 
[00:19:00]  He refused all surgery for years.  Yeah.  Well, that's what you get.  What a bad Jehovah's Witness he must have been.  I mean, guys in general, we're scared of doctors,  but if you see something that's a little out of control,  you're running to a doctor.  A little out of control.  Well, it started out as a little out of control, right?  I don't know.  That picture of his lip, it's pretty much over by then.  Well, it looked like he got punched in the lip. 
[00:19:30]  And that's how we start today.  We're going to get that video up on onaradio.com.  Oh, yeah.  And now someone is bringing to our attention  that there's a guy that's called Tree Man.  Tree Man?  He's the Asian dude.  You've seen Tree Man?  He makes this guy look like Rudy Valentino.  Tree Man is a goose.  By the way, I love the fact that we also have an article on this guy. 
[00:20:00]  This is a...  He becomes a local celebrity.  A notoriety he does not always seem to resent.  Unable to find work or a girlfriend.  I think it's hilarious that he's actually out looking.  He still has hope that he's going to find a girlfriend.  For a chick.  Holy crap.  Look at Tree Man.  I wasn't thinking of him.  There's another guy.  Oh, my God.  Look at Tree Man.  All right.  That's just not even human.  Are those flies on it?  What is that?  What is that?  What? 
[00:20:30]  It looks like when Stephen King was Geordie Verrill  and he went to the meteor and got some meteor crap on him.  He's a big lunkhead.  Always in.  Always bad.  I ought to take it up to college.  You've got to see Tree Man.  I know this is radio, but...  His hands.  How do you explain that?  It looks like the roots of a tree.  And he's smoking with them.  He's smoking.  He's going to set himself on fire. 
[00:21:00]  Eric, why were there spiders on him?  There's massive hands.  He should have two hobbits on his back.  I want to make cookies on him.  His feet looks like he stepped in elephant you-know-what.  Yeah.  And then couldn't get the elephant you-know-what off his feet.  That's what his feet looks like.  Just massive just like stuff.  Those are third world diseases.  We have like...  That's what I said earlier.  We have wacky American diseases, you know.  You don't see those in America.  Anorexia, bulimia, things like that.  That's kind of that disease that happens down in South America. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  Proving God doesn't want you.  No, no.  God hates those countries.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So we'll link Tree Man to onaradio.com later today as well.  That is disgusting.  Wow.  An Asian guy who I don't remember his name, obviously.  And he has a massive, massive tumor and he goes for surgery.  Can we find that?  Did the Asian dude...  Do you know who he is, Travis?  Oh.  That is so bad. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, Tree Man has...  It looks like tree stumps.  Like when it goes...  The roots.  The tree roots coming off his hands and his feet.  Oh, yeah, that guy.  You see the other dude?  Yeah, yeah.  That guy's hysterical.  Well, by hysterical, I mean gross and disgusting and unlookatable.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  We'll find...  Oh, there he is.  I thought...  All right.  Wow.  It looks like his face is melting.  It's after surgery.  What do you mean?  I believe that's after... 
[00:22:30]  That's an improvement?  Really?  What did he look like before?  Not good.  Not good.  That's his second operation.  Let's find the before picture.  Oof.  Oh, my God.  That's...  Oh, my God.  How do you explain that one?  I can't.  He looks like a giant...  It looks like a giant penis.  I just got to be honest.  It does.  With a little hairdo on it.  A little soup.  Well, a giant penis that has a problem.  It's all you-know-what. 
[00:23:00]  A mess.  It's all...  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't have...  He doesn't have...  He doesn't have this.  He doesn't have much of this.  He has a lot of this.  He doesn't have a lot of what it takes to really do some action.  He's got the Darth Vader part.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  This is how we begin today.  Terrific.  After the break, we're going to play a few Twister Clips.  We started this yesterday.  We found more Twister Clips.  We'll explain.  That's good too.  Looks like Zoidberg.  Yeah.  From Futurama.  Hello, it's Zoidberg. 
[00:23:30]  Look at my face.  He's just eating crustaceans.  Yeah.  We'll be talking about Heath Ledger.  Looks like Zoidberg.  What else?  Oh, proof that Clemens did steroids, possibly.  We've got lots to do today.  Yeah.  Why don't we step aside, take a break with a Grammy moment, because we've got the Grammys  right around the corner, and then we'll continue.  Stay there.  It's an Opie and Anthony Grammy Minute. 
[00:24:00]  Record of the year.  Beyonce, irreplaceable.  You must not know about me.  You must not know about me.  I could have another you in a minute.  Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute.  Baby, you must not know about me.  You must not know about me.  I could have another you by tomorrow.  So don't ever, for a second, get to dig in your irreplaceable. 
[00:24:30]  Expand your Grammy knowledge base with Opie and Anthony.  The Grammy Awards, February 10th at 8 p.m. on CBS.  It's the Opie and Anthony shoot.  It's a busy one, too.  Britney Spears is out of the psych ward.  Much to her parents' chagrin.  They don't want her out.  No, that means something really awful is going to happen now.  That was her last chance. 
[00:25:00]  Now something really awful is going to happen.  Yeah?  Yeah, absolutely.  No doubt in my mind.  The paparazzi didn't take long to swarm her.  She was just driving around in some black Mercedes around L.A.  and being followed by the paparazzi.  She stopped at a stop sign and they swarmed her car.  You saw the footage?  Yeah.  They went live with this in L.A.  because they love their car chases out there.  And, yeah, Britney was making a left turn to go into the Beverly Hills Hotel, I believe.  And, yeah, then all of a sudden, what, 20 or 30, about 20 SUVs all made the left turn at the same time 
[00:25:30]  and then funneled into the one lane.  Some amazing, amazing video.  Yeah, they had a helicopter overhead.  And Britney is surrounded by yes people.  And her new psychiatrist basically said she doesn't need to be in the psych ward anymore.  All right.  And the parents are like, oh, my God.  It's going to be ugly.  It's definitely going to be really ugly now.  So is the psychiatrist going to take responsibility when she's found dead in the hotel room 
[00:26:00]  and they're wheeling her out?  She's either going to be dead.  She's going to run somebody.  Something really bad is going to happen within the next week.  Bank on it.  Yeah.  She was just in a padded room.  Yeah.  She was in a padded room at a mental hospital.  Yeah.  And then it's like, oh, okay, now you could leave.  Yeah.  I think she needs a little more counseling.  And then you got Heath Ledger.  The toxicology reports came out yesterday, and it was an accidental overdose. 
[00:26:30]  Of everything.  Yeah, of everything.  Exactly.  He was pretty much taking everything that people take these days.  Yeah.  Like not every, you know, I don't think he had any chemo in him or any drugs for arthritis maybe.  Right.  But every drug that people take recreationally, a prescription drug, he had in him.  He had, basically he had Oxycontin, you know, in him. 
[00:27:00]  Valium.  Valium.  Vicodin.  Xanax.  Xanax.  And because that stuff wasn't good enough, he had NyQuil and Unisom.  Yeah.  I was telling Anthony, I'm like, why, if you have all these drugs, do you need to get an  over-the-counter Unisom on top of this?  Some over-the-counter stuff.  Like Unisom.  Everything else isn't quite cutting it.  Right.  Unisom is obviously over-the-counter.  It helps you, you know, go to sleep.  Yeah.  Right.  And some Aspergum.  Right.  And they found Tylenol PM. 
[00:27:30]  And they basically said, if you mix these drugs, you can stop breathing within 10 minutes  if the combination is not right.  I guess the combination wasn't right.  Yeah.  What's really disturbing about the Heath Ledger thing, they still haven't buried his body.  Wow.  Now, the toxicology reports take about two weeks, so I'm not really keeping that close  tabs on this, but he's been dead, what, at least two weeks then?  Mm-hmm.  A little over two weeks.  He's still rolling around in that pine box.  Oof.  And you know how, like, I had to go through this, unfortunately. 
[00:28:00]  You got to, like, you know, pick out a coffin for a loved one.  Mm-hmm.  And you kind of, and they, you know, it's not bad enough, you lose a loved one, but then  they throw a little guilt at you, because they take you downstairs where the coffins are  on display.  The showroom.  Have you ever been through this?  Yeah.  There is, there's a lot of humor in it.  I'm just going to knock.  But there's actually a lot of humor in this.  I don't know how ridiculous it is.  They bring you downstairs, and they got the pine box, basically, that is poorly lit. 
[00:28:30]  We could put your loved one in this, baby.  Yeah.  It's poorly lit.  It's just kind of over there in the darkness.  And then over here is, ah, the Mac Daddy of coffins.  And then you start thinking, oh, boy, is there a life after death?  You know, is Pop's going to be pissed if we throw him in the pine box?  Or should we do the right thing and throw him in this $25,000 Rolls Royce of coffins?  And I thought about that yesterday because Heath Ledger's just rolling around in a pine  box for the last two weeks as they shipped him off to L.A. 
[00:29:00]  Now they shipped him to Australia.  He's on tour.  He's still just rolling around, bouncing off the inside of that box.  Yeah.  And I was thinking, if there was life after death and he could feel something or something's  going on, he would be, I think he'd be pretty pissed right about now.  Get me a satin pillow, man.  I told my mother that what I'm going to do, and she better be ready, is get a small box  and just break her legs backwards and throw them on her chest.  You can break this on the cheeks.  Oh, the guilt they give you, man. 
[00:29:30]  It's like, all right, will you just stop?  This is tough enough.  I don't need to now, like, shop for a coffin like I would shop for a car.  Yeah.  Dopes.  So that's what's coming out on Heath Ledger today, a combination of a lot of very familiar  drugs.  But prescription drugs, and now they're looking into who gave him the prescriptions.  Well, he was, there's a term for it.  He was using a bunch of doctors, going from one doctor to the other doctor.  Oh, was he?  There's a term for it now, because a lot of the Hollywood people do that. 
[00:30:00]  You know, they get one drug from this doctor, and then they go to another doctor, and this  doctor has no clue what the other doctor prescribed, and he's giving you something, and next  you know, you got four or five prescriptions, and you're rocking and rolling, and then  you take the wrong combination, and then you stop breathing, and you're dead within 10  minutes.  Lovely.  And they're saying how much of a shame it is still.  Whatever.  What's up, Jimmy?  I was just reading about a guy who said his son's on fire with gasoline.  I just, I don't get it. 
[00:30:30]  I don't either.  Animals.  In other news, we had a tornado problem in a place called Tornado Alley.  Yeah.  And I know it's hacked by now, because a lot of comedians do the joke, but seriously,  why would you live there?  Why would you live in Tornado Alley?  I guess it's cheap.  There's a lot of cheap places to live in America that are close to water, and close  to palm trees, and hurricanes.  Then you get hurricanes.  Yeah, but hurricanes, they move so slowly, at least you know what's going on. 
[00:31:00]  With the tornadoes, they come and go like that.  Pretty quick.  Can you imagine living in Tornado Alley?  Seriously.  Wouldn't you be scared S-less every night?  Because they just come out of nowhere, and take your house, and take your little one.  Yeah, you'd be sleeping, and then just, you know, your house is gone.  And you wake up in a tree somewhere, like five miles away.  Like a car on top of you.  We did Kansas City last year, and I was getting ready for HBO.  Me and Kenny had to fly out back here from Kansas City.  It was in between tornadoes, and it was just a gray, black sky. 
[00:31:30]  It was like a 51 seat in Brayer, and we took off, and it was horrifying.  It's horrifying when you know you're flying in those weather conditions.  You're going to fly, like, out of the eye of a bunch of them, and then up above them.  But it was terrifying.  Yeah.  The end of my story.  The end of my story.  Well, very good.  I mean, the reason we're bringing up the tornadoes, it's up to, I think, 50 people died, huh?  Yeah, yeah.  It's the worst one in about 20 years, they said.  The worst string of tornadoes.  And this gives us, well, besides the worst string of tornadoes ever, you know, the stupid 
[00:32:00]  news lady today was creeping us all out here in New York because we set a record.  It was 68 degrees in Central Park yesterday, and she was basically saying, oh, my God, this  has never happened ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.  That you hit a high that's 10 degrees higher than the previous high.  Usually you break a record by one or two degrees.  And that keeps everyone calm because you're like, well, back in 1849, it was 57, and today  they got up to 58.  So you're like, okay, 100 and some odd years, 150 some odd years, it's only a degree different. 
[00:32:30]  That keeps everyone calm.  But when you see 10 degrees from the previous record, she's like, wow, this is a little crazy.  Are you saying this has to do with global warming?  I don't know.  Yeah.  I think it has something to do with Cloverfield coming.  The Cloverfield monster.  Yeah.  They're eating the rainforest and making the earth warmer or something.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like looking at global warming shows. 
[00:33:00]  It creeps me out too much.  So I avoid it.  I watched that Al Gore movie.  I avoided that.  Did you?  Yeah.  I don't want to know.  Well, you should out of boredom.  Is it boring?  It's him on stage with a bunch of charts.  Yeah.  It's just boring.  I don't know.  I don't know what to make of the whole global warming thing.  I'm not qualified.  I don't think it matters as much as everybody says. 
[00:33:30]  And it might sound odd.  I know people go, no, no, it does.  It does.  But in the long run, does it matter?  Are we going to be wiped off the face of the earth as humans?  Or might it cull the herd a little bit around the coastal areas?  That might be a good thing.  It depends on your perspective.  I mean, as far as the universe goes, it doesn't matter.  They're like, whatever.  That'll take care of itself.  Oh, yeah.  As far as the universe goes, it's nothing.  That whole area will just go back to where it was before these stupid humans, you know?  I worry more about the dumb black holes that are going to suck everything up into nothingness. 
[00:34:00]  Well, they're not exactly creeping up on us.  I mean, we just kind of know where they are.  Black holes, it's not like we think one's passing over.  Where did that come from?  You know, Obama talks about change.  You want change?  Yeah.  Global warming.  That's real change.  I think the world needs a big, like, plague or something.  Something huge to really get rid of a lot of people.  Something horrific. 
[00:34:30]  And maybe the global warming thing will do something where, you know, the weather problems will wipe out a lot of people.  Because we're just, there's too many people.  And there's too many people that have put their priorities in, like, the wrong place.  When you're faced with global death and destruction, that kind of makes people think a little more.  Takes their mind off of dirty words on the radio and things like that.  Ah, good point. 
[00:35:00]  You know, I just think we need something good, like a good 14th century disease.  A little black plague?  Yeah, something like that.  Everyone thought AIDS was going to be it, but we kind of figured that out a little bit.  It was the rats.  Yeah.  The rats, you know, spread the black plague.  There's still plenty of rats.  We figured that out.  Look, I'm reading about rats, finally.  Finally, we get to the end of this book.  And the reason why, the rats still carry, like, the ticks and stuff that could, you know, spread the black plague. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  But the rats now live underground because of the sewer systems and stuff.  And that's why the whole black plague and stuff is kept in check.  They don't just run in the streets anymore.  No.  In the gutters of the street.  Yeah.  Back in the day, they pretty much ran, you know, alongside humans.  For the most part, they didn't have a, you know, depending on which rat, by the way.  Some rats knew how to burrow and stuff.  But the rats that carried the black plague, oh, yeah.  They were the ones that kind of lived among us.  And now they're all underground in sewer systems and in pipes and in basements and all that crap. 
[00:36:00]  And that's why.  How do we get none of them to come up?  There's got to be some that.  Oh, they come up.  Yeah, sure.  You see them every so often, yeah.  Yeah, but not enough to, you know, create a plague.  They're still spreading horrific diseases every day.  You know that perfume was invented to ward off the plague?  Really?  Yeah, because they believed if you, like, smelled good that you wouldn't get the plague.  Dummies.  Oh, they were just as dumb as they'd come.  Because they didn't know what the black plague was. 
[00:36:30]  They thought it had something to do with molecules in the air and foul smells and stuff.  So they figured if you smelled good, if you had an aura of good smell, you would keep the bad air away from you?  Oh, they were just nuts.  What they believed back then.  Dummies.  Anyway, getting back to the tornado.  So we love this movie Twister on this show, this Hopi and Anthony show that we do.  Because it's probably the worst movie ever made as far as the writing goes and the dialogue and the acting. 
[00:37:00]  And I don't think it's ever been acknowledged for being a really bad movie.  It was a blockbuster action movie when it came out.  And it made, what did we find out yesterday?  It made something like a quarter billion dollars in the U.S. alone and like a half a billion worldwide.  This movie was huge and no one really acknowledges how awful this movie was, how awful the acting was, how awful the plot was.  Over the top dialogue that's just too extreme, dramatic, man. 
[00:37:30]  It wasn't even film right because there's film flubs all over the movie.  Yeah.  Just a bad movie all around.  I think because it's expected to be bad though.  People are like, ah, it's a storm movie, it's going to be terrible.  Yeah.  Well, we got some more Twister clips and this is perfect because of the tornado.  So let's go right to the first one from Twister.  This movie came out, I believe, in 1996.  That was dusty, wasn't it? 
[00:38:00]  Yeah.  It's like screaming out, it's the wonder of nature, baby, and then cranking the music.  And this was Philip Seymour Hoffman's big role, right?  Yeah.  He was doing just little things before this, I believe, and this was the one that kind of put him on the map.  He was the scent of a woman.  Yeah.  He doesn't even want to...  Oh, that's right.  Yeah.  He doesn't even want to acknowledge he ever made this movie.  I'd love to interview him and only talk about this movie.  Could you do your dusty character, please? 
[00:38:30]  Yeah!  Yeah!  Don't mention Capote.  Don't mention Boogie Nights.  Only this movie.  Only this movie.  Only Twister.  We've done that interview before with another actor.  Who did we do it with?  Was it Paxton?  No.  Who was in Bill?  Oh, Dennis...  Oh, Dennis Quaid.  Dennis Quaid, yeah.  Right, okay.  More bad audio from Twister.  Joe!  Bill!  It's coming!  It's in a race for us! 
[00:39:00]  It's already here.  Everybody underground now!  It's already here!  You hear that awkward pause?  Yeah.  It's coming!  It's in a race for us!  How bad is this, Jimmy?  It's horrendous.  With the really dramatic music.  It's already here!  Game over, man!  Game over! 
[00:39:30]  Why don't you put her in charge?  The next one, it's a little long, but it's worth it, because they talk about the suck  zone of a tornado, and we meet Dorothy.  Dorothy is what?  The contraption they came up with that they want to throw in the middle of the freaking  tornado to get some readings or something, right?  If we can get this new information, we can increase warning time to 15 minutes.  Give people a chance to get to safety.  At least that's what these guys are trying to do.  Why are they clapping? 
[00:40:00]  Did someone say we're not making this movie anymore?  Give them a chance to get to safety.  Really?  They're just all extreme!  Yeah, man!  Woo!  Just a bunch of beer-drinking douches.  The worst.  And they're all...  Chasing wind.  They're all a little too old to be doing this, you know?  Right.  Like this, you can picture people in their early 20s, tornado chasing and stuff.  Sure.  And there's Bill Paxton. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  He's going to get married and be a weatherman, but I'm just going to chase tornadoes, because  it's in my blood, man.  It's in my blood.  Got to get rid of the demons in front.  Demons.  Yeah.  He throws his bottle of whiskey into the tornado.  Yeah.  Whoa.  And that's it!  Go back!  Go back!  I can't believe you actually did it.  Well, we did it.  All right. 
[00:41:00]  How do you get it in the tornado?  Well, you got to get in front of the tornado and put it in the damage path, and then get  out again before it picks you up, too.  This sucks, huh?  Oh.  Excellent.  Joe, we got major action.  The NSSL says the cap is breaking.  The tower's going up 30 miles off the dry line.  Just talk fast and say things no one really understands.  Yeah.  That's what you got to do.  The music was really, really ill-placed.  It was ill-placed music. 
[00:41:30]  The suck zone was anywhere in the theater.  They couldn't even get the music right for this movie, because if I remember correctly,  they used Van Halen's Human Being.  Yeah.  Van Halen was a great band, man.  Who didn't love Van Halen growing up?  And they picked probably the only song that sucked from the band.  Human Being.  Come on.  All right.  In this next clip, we got two more really fast before break.  We meet the evil twister team.  Yeah.  Now, come on.  They're the evil chasers. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  You know, you got to have the conflict.  Yeah.  The good guys and the bad guys.  Mm-hmm.  The good guys are doing it because they really care about, like, human safety.  Bad guys, they're like corporate, and they just want to make money, man.  They want to make money and a name for themselves.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Jonas, son of a bitch.  Who is that, honey?  Wait a minute.  Miss Miller.  Just, come on.  How does that deliver a line?  Jonas, son of a bitch.  What, he recognizes that it's the evil team? 
[00:42:30]  Yes, it's the evil team because they travel in huge black SUVs.  Right.  All in a line.  Yeah.  In a perfectly choreographed line of vehicles.  Of evilness.  Of evilness.  And they're like the bad tornado chaser guys that are just in it for themselves.  And they're just in pickup trucks and, right?  Yeah, yeah.  The good tornado guys are into, like, junk vehicles.  Yeah, yeah.  And they, you know, thank God they have the smart guys that are able to just jury-rig  everything together, man, so they could do things for the people. 
[00:43:00]  So we could give them an extra 15 minutes to get to safety.  All right.  Jonas, son of a bitch.  Who is that, honey?  Jonas Miller.  He's a night crawler.  We all started out in the same lab that Jonas went out and got himself some corporate sponsors.  He's in it for the money, not the science.  He's got a lot of high-tech gadgets, but he's got no instincts. 
[00:43:30]  And he doesn't have Dorothy.  Oh, Jesus.  I can't.  I get, like, he doesn't have Dorothy.  Jonas.  Of course, they, like, you know, they went to the same place to learn, and, you know,  one of them becomes, like, the good guy that wants to help everyone, and the other one gets  the corporate sponsorship.  Well, how bad can the bad guys be?  Like, what do they want to do?  They want to make the tornadoes deadlier? 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  They're not killing enough people.  We have to have them touched down on schools.  Yeah, their whole thing was they wanted to do the same thing, kind of be able to predict  where they're coming from.  You know what?  You're absolutely right, Jimmy.  In the end, it's going to be good.  It's going to be good for everybody.  He was a showboater.  You know, he liked getting in front of the news camera and stuff.  Yeah.  The bad guy.  Who was that?  Carrie Elwiz?  Elw?  Who cares?  Carrie Elwiz?  Well, the last clip we got for today, and hopefully we'll have more tomorrow, because  we can't get enough of this movie.  The good twister people fight the bad twister people. 
[00:44:30]  Of course they do.  They have a little showdown.  Hey, hey, hey!  Son of a bitch!  What'd you think?  I wasn't going to find out about this punk?  Hey, guys, get this loser off me!  All right, back off!  Back off!  Put your malfunction, man!  It's not worth it!  What is the matter with you?  You stole my design, you son of a bitch!  Calm down!  What the hell are you talking about?  Dorothy.  You took her, you damn thief.  Oh, I get it.  You want to take credit for my design, is that it?  You're a liar.  She was our idea, and you know it. 
[00:45:00]  Unrealized idea.  Wait, I have to say...  Okay, yes, yes.  Yes, yes.  Is that a cow moo in the back?  Yeah.  How is there a cow moo in the middle of that?  Well, because they're in the middle of a tornado, you know, alley.  There's a lot of cows and horses in the middle.  You stole Dorothy!  And it was the same gadget, wasn't it?  Only the inside, like, the little things were square instead of round.  He goes, you stole her!  It's called, like, Dot or something.  It's not just a clear ripoff. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Our idea, and you know it.  Unrealized idea.  Unrealized.  Guys, guys, guys!  Oh, my guys!  Get a grip on yourself.  We both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.  That's right.  Well, let me enlighten you people.  This baby has subtle...  It's like community theater.  This was a huge Hollywood blockbuster, Jimmy.  Let me enlighten you people.  Helen Hunt, by the way.  Can you go back a teeny bit to hell?  Guy, she's just terrible. 
[00:46:00]  She's trying to break up the fight between the head of the good guys and head of the bad guys.  Yeah.  Because they all want Helen Hunt, which is just so unrealistic, too, by the way.  Waiting for Paxton.  He'll be here.  How realistic is it that they all are fighting for Helen Hunt, too?  Not at all.  Yeah.  Well, we both know he'll never get that thing up in the air.  That's right.  Well, let me enlighten you people.  This baby has satellite comm link. 
[00:46:30]  We got on board Paul Stoppler.  We got next ride real time.  Today, we're going to make history.  So stick around.  Because the days of sniffing the dirt are over.  Better than what you sniff.  We'll see who gets it first, pal.  Oh, and by the way, I really enjoy your weather reports.  You slime.  I'm not doing you yet.  Come on.  Come here.  Oh, God.  Do they have to hold him back? 
[00:47:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  Got to hold him back.  You slime.  You slime.  What?  Wow.  Stop it.  The guy wants to throw the thing up and help the storms cut quick.  How is he slime?  He's slime.  Stole Dorothy.  Game over.  Relax.  They'll never get it up in the air.  Jimmy, do you think these people like tornadoes?  No, I don't. 
[00:47:30]  They love them.  Got scared.  The universe wasn't in balance.  I thought that was going to be the end of the catchphrase.  We love catchphrases.  Sonny Ferelli, what's up?  Real fast.  Hey, I don't know why you guys are picking on this movie so badly.  I mean, I liked it.  I thought it was a pretty good movie.  Oh, did you?  Stop it.  No, no, really.  Just stop.  Really?  Why are you guys picking on this movie so badly? 
[00:48:00]  I don't understand it.  Are you listening to the clips, you dolt?  Yeah, I am.  But, you know, I thought one of my favorite scenes there was when Dusty was chasing that tornado,  put that track of deep purple on there, and was chasing after that tornado like that out of hell, you know?  All right.  All right.  I'm relieved, because I was really believing your acting, that you actually liked this movie.  You act better than the people in Twister.  And then just like a tornado, here comes the sarcasm. 
[00:48:30]  What deep purple track did he play?  Do you remember?  I believe that was Stormbringer.  What was it called?  Stormbringer.  You're out of California, Jim.  Everything is Storm something.  Yeah, but out of all the deep purple songs you can play, another obscure song.  You need one with Storm in it.  I understand.  Yeah!  Stream!  Thank you, Sonny.  All right, get rid of this crap. 
[00:49:00]  We've got to take a quick break.  Hey, Black History Month.  We've got a brand new honoree.  Mm-hmm.  But we're going to play yesterday's one more time.  Yes.  So this was yesterday's, and a little later on in the show.  Brand new.  We'll have today's honoree.  All right?  I wonder what important person is going to be honored today.  Today's a good one.  It's Opie and Anthony.  In honor of Black History Month, the Opie and Anthony Show is honoring black heroes, 
[00:49:30]  African-American individuals throughout history, without whom this country would not be the melting pot.  It is today.  Today we honor talk show host, supermodel, and sometimes actress, Tyra Banks.  So I have something to say.  To all of you that have something nasty to say about me, or other women that are built like me,  women that sometimes, all the time look like this,  women whose names you know, women whose names you don't,  women who've been f***ed on, women whose husbands put them down, 
[00:50:00]  women at work, or girls in school,  I have one thing to say to you.  Kiss my fat ass.  That's right.  It's never about you, Tyra.  Just keep giving and giving.  Fanny party!  Stay tuned for more icons of black history on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Good morning.  It's time to wake the F up and go to your miserable job. 
[00:50:30]  But the weekend's almost here.  Yes!  And then you get to drink your face off.  877-212-ON-A.  It's a very interactive radio show.  Now what's going on with Clemens there, Jimmy?  Clemens was down, what, down there in Washington,  and he spoke for how many hours?  A few hours.  Yes.  Denying that he used steroids, human growth hormones, 
[00:51:00]  denied that he ever drank milk.  What?  Never said the F word.  Never said the F word, right.  Never beat his wife.  Oh, my God.  They make you sweat down there.  When you get in front of that panel of whatever's,  they make you sweat.  It's very difficult to come off innocent.  Well, Clemens, he didn't crack.  He said, nope, nope, nope, nope.  I didn't, I didn't, nope, nope. 
[00:51:30]  Tell him the truth, tell him the truth, blah, blah, blah.  So then his trainer comes out today, I guess,  or late yesterday, and said, what, Jimmy?  Brian McNamee said that he has syringes  and other physical evidence  which back up his evidence, including gauze.  Goodness gracious!  Wow, goodness gracious.  One of the most dramatic things I've ever seen!  His side turned over gauze pads and syringes.  They said that Clemens' blood to IRS special agent, blah, blah,  in early January.  The syringes were used to inject Clemens with steroids 
[00:52:00]  and human growth hormones.  A second person, also speaking on condition of anonymity,  said the evidence was from 2000, 2001.  Why is this trainer holding on to things  with flexible Clemens' blood on them and gauze  from eight years ago?  What is your motive?  Sports memorabilia?  You know what?  It may be.  Yeah.  Going to clone him?  Maybe there's some cloning?  Clone the rocket?  I'm not a big sports memorabilia person,  although I do have a signed Derek Jeter ball, 
[00:52:30]  thanks to XM.  And I got a canceled check from Pistol Pete Maravich.  Wow.  That I got for Christmas.  He was having a little plumbing work done.  I got a canceled check.  From his plumbing?  But he signed the check, and it's cool to me  because he was a hero of mine growing up.  But I would buy a freaking steroids syringe.  Syringe?  For a lot of money, too.  How cool would that be to display that in your house? 
[00:53:00]  It would have to be put in a little glass display box?  We've talked about it in the past that, you know,  I want to collect the weird stuff.  I want to collect, like, Elvis' last duty.  Well, everyone wants that thing.  Oh, that's an obvious one?  But I heard they flushed.  Yeah, they did?  I heard when they came to get him, they flushed.  That's gone.  Remember the time we talked to Graceland?  I would love to find the audio.  And the caretaker or the person that's in charge of Graceland,  I forgot why they were calling our show.  They were promoting something.  And Elvis', I don't know, 30-year anniversary death or whatever. 
[00:53:30]  And remember, all we asked about was the duty?  Yeah.  To the point where she was getting so frustrated.  We're like, come on.  You've seen the duty.  Where's the duty?  Is it in the basement?  Everyone wants to know.  Every question was about Elvis' last duty.  And then we wanted Ted Williams' head.  Yeah.  This frozen head.  Which we found out when they freeze people's heads, you know, this whole cryogenic thing  where you're supposed to freeze your body or freeze your head until they come up with  a cure for whatever disease it is.  And in thousands and thousands of years, supposedly you're able to take your head and take the 
[00:54:00]  brain or even your, just the electric impulses that make your brain, make you who you are  and put them in something else.  They don't know.  They're just freezing it, hoping that does something.  Well, we found out that it's not really the head frozen perfectly that they're going to  sew on another body because it decomposes.  So, yeah, even though it's frozen, it kind of starts turning into chopped meat. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah.  Really?  And I'm so glad you brought up Ted Williams because it allows us to play one of my favorite  clips of all time.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head.  I think that's his sister or daughter.  Some relative that was fighting with his son.  Yeah.  With his son that wanted to totally just market him.  Yeah.  He said, well, you know, we don't have to freeze his whole body.  We can freeze his head. 
[00:55:00]  So what are they saying with this Roger Clemens needle?  That I don't know.  That it apparently has either human hormones, his own, his blood or steroids.  It's got some kind of a combination.  Why is this guy saving that stuff?  Unless he was going to blackmail him.  I mean, I can't comprehend.  Yeah.  There's no other reason to save that.  But when you read about this guy, it seems like he was pretty tight with Clemens and stuff.  It wasn't like he was, you know, looking ahead like he was going to try to screw the guy.  Maybe he knew that this was so wrong that he wanted to cover his own ass, though. 
[00:55:30]  You know, because when they were doing steroids, they were kind of sneaking around in the locker room.  You know, Jose Canseco says some very interesting stuff where it was.  So you're thinking if he was implicated in any of it, he could say, hey.  Yeah.  He could take some people down with him and maybe help his own cause.  I don't know.  You might be right.  But I don't get why you save a needle for eight years.  Yeah.  Who saves bloody gauze for eight years?  I mean, you got to get rid of it.  Isn't that illegal to save that stuff?  Shouldn't you put that in a biohazard thing?  Yeah, I don't think so. 
[00:56:00]  Well, we were on to something a few weeks ago because we got audio of Roger Clemens admitting that he did, you know, the steroids.  Yeah.  We're the only ones that had it, right?  Yeah, we're the only ones.  Exclusive.  For some reason, CNN is not playing this audio.  ESPN's not playing this audio.  I don't understand because it's very obvious when you listen to this clip that Clemens is very guilty.  Oh, yeah, it's very obvious.  I want to say thanks to this Mitchell report.  I've been getting emails and questions on this subject, and now the whole world knows the answer is that I use steroids.  Over the last 15 days or so, when I played in Toronto for the Blue Jays, Brian Mack and me used steroids to inject into my body. 
[00:56:30]  And I'm very thankful for those steroids, and it's been extremely difficult to do this.  I'm almost numb to steroids and human growth hormones.  I'm angry about it, to be honest with you.  It's hurtful to have thousands of people to inject human growth hormone into my body.  My friends to inject steroids into my body.  The New York Yankees to inject human growth hormone into my body. 
[00:57:00]  The whole team?  My children use drugs, and it means a lot to me.  In my family, to inject steroids.  Again, it's amazing to me that I have to even use steroids.  And I want to say thanks to Brian McNamee of the New York Yankees.  After Christmas, I'm going to sit down with Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, and I'll inject drugs into my body.  Right there in front of him, and we'll do all this again.  And let me be clear, I'm very thankful for those steroids. 
[00:57:30]  And Mike Wallace used drugs now that that's come out.  My children to inject steroids into Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes, but we're coming upon Christmas now, and I have been blessed in my life.  I've been blessed in my career, and the answer is that I use steroids.  Wait, you know what, dude?  Listen to that again.  What, Jimmy?  There's something weird about that.  It's like he keeps repeating the same thing.  Yeah.  He sounds nervous.  In the same inflection and everything.  Yeah, he sounds nervous.  Well, steroids gives you, like, OCD, and you've just got to say the same thing over and over. 
[00:58:00]  How come, though, the focus when I watch the news is still on him when it should be on the fact that his children injected Mike Wallace?  That, to me, is far more important.  I know.  I love that clip.  Changing gears, stupid Bob Kelly.  Yeah.  Yeah, we need a sound effect when we change gears.  Work on that, E-Rock.  Changing gears.  E-Rock.  Yeah.  Hey, Bob Kelly, stupid Bob Kelly, he texted everybody last night asking us if we saw Stevie Wonder falling down. 
[00:58:30]  And I wish the clip was playable for radio.  Well, it's not really an audio clip.  It really is a visual.  A visual.  Another clip we'll put up on onaradio.com today.  That's the place to go for all the visual stuff we talk about.  Even Stevie can't enjoy it.  And I was telling Anthony, you know, I'm loving this whole political discussion we're having on this radio show.  It's really, really interesting.  It really is.  And I'm in agreement with one thing that Anthony has been saying. 
[00:59:00]  Oh.  That Obama's wife.  I'll give you the bell now.  Yeah.  What?  No.  Oh, okay, sorry.  Obama's wife is a wild card in this thing.  She does scare me, like you brought to everyone's attention.  Yeah.  She looks like she's full of herself.  She's a loose cannon.  She's definitely a loose cannon.  You got Stevie Wonder walking on stage at some rally, an Obama rally, obviously, with Obama's wife.  And as they're getting up on the stage, I guess they're stepping up onto the stage, Stevie Wonder falls really hard out of sight. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah.  The thing is, she is guiding him.  You know how you got to guide blind people?  You know, and there are people that are good at it, I guess, and people that don't know what the hell they're doing.  Yeah.  She apparently backstage, they probably said, look, put your arm out and Stevie will hold your arm and then you just walk out.  And she was so taken with the moment and the applause and herself and the Obama signs that she didn't pay any attention to where Stevie was when she walked up the stairs to the stage and just kind of guided him right off the stage. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, and he falls.  And he falls.  He just tumbles right off the stage.  He gets up and you see he's squinting because his sunglasses fell off.  Yeah.  And his handler comes over finally.  Well, he's squinting because he doesn't want anyone to see those lifeless eyes.  Oh, the doll's eyes.  Black eyes like a doll's eyes.  Yeah, that are just still in his head.  Eyes roll back white. 
[01:00:30]  And this is what bothers me, and this is why I'm with Anthony.  She kind of tries to help him for a split second and then goes, ah, I got things to do.  These people are cheering for me.  I got to get in the middle of this stage immediately.  And she walks way ahead of him while Stevie's still having problems behind her.  Yeah.  Putting his glasses on.  His suit is askew.  He's a mess.  He just fell off a stage.  Right.  How scary is it when you're a blind guy and you feel yourself falling?  You don't know if the ground is right there.  Oh, or if it's a thousand feet. 
[01:01:00]  Yeah, are we on a cliff doing this rally?  There's spikes down there.  And if that's true, you don't know how far you're falling.  Oh, good, good, good.  And if you're going to be blind, why don't you lose a little weight, keep yourself in shape?  Because, you know, you know you're going to need people to help you around a little bit.  Make their job a little easier.  Yeah.  He walks around.  Oh, man, this is going to be really bad.  He walks around like he's...  Why are you whispering on radio?  He walks around like he's retarded.  Does he? 
[01:01:30]  Yes.  Like, he walks around like he's an adult.  Mm-hmm.  That's a little slow.  A little slow?  Yeah.  Genius on that piano.  Ah.  Genius writing them songs.  We'll never deny that.  He, um...  I don't know.  Why should he get in shape?  Like, when you think about it, like, you're blind.  You know, you've been a...  He's been a household name basically since he was 12.  Yeah.  You know?  He's got nothing to gain by being in shape.  Yeah.  Like, as long as he's healthy, he's not overweight to the point, I think, of being unhealthy.  It's just awful. 
[01:02:00]  You know?  I could watch that a thousand times.  Is it?  Go ahead.  I saw a footage of him and Diana Ross.  This is how an old man I am.  I was on YouTube watching him and Diana Ross do a duet, and it was lovely.  Ooh.  From what?  19, like, 60?  No, it was, like, late 71.  Oh, wow.  Like, that type vibe.  Wow.  Like, pantsuits were popular.  She just walks.  She walks right to the podium because she's got places to be.  She loves the attention that her husband's getting.  Yeah, she really is digging this.  And I'm with you on this one, Ant.  She's picturing herself as the first lady. 
[01:02:30]  A little worried about her.  And I just see her being very overbearing as a first lady.  If she gets in there and he gets in there, I see the White House changing a bit.  You got to paint the White House a different color.  Oh, that old gag.  I think it might look a little like Marcellus Wallace's house. 
[01:03:00]  Wouldn't it like they'll have the paintings like Scatman Crothers had this right in there?  Now that I wouldn't mind in the Lincoln bedroom.  The big Afro, nude Afro women on the velvet.  Sort of grape soda to foreign dignitaries.  Scatman Crothers laying there with his huge feet and big toes.  And you just see that Afro-headed woman.  I like her, though, man.  I don't know much about her, but I kind of like the fact that she's a little out there.  First lady's always boring.  Good.  Yeah.  And well, they should be.  In other Obama news, did you see the picture? 
[01:03:30]  I think it was on TMZ.  We got to find it and throw it on onaradio.com.  Well, they found Obama.  Well, Obama knows where she is, but the press has found Obama's great-grandmother or grandmother  in Kenya holding a live chicken.  Oh, yeah?  Holding a live chicken in Kenya.  Interesting.  And she is as dark as night.  Wow.  She is as dark as night.  Well, Kenya.  Yeah. 
[01:04:00]  You got to figure.  You know, that's pretty...  Find that picture for the boys.  That's what the Kennedy grandfathers were doing.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  And we can't talk about Obama without this, of course.  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 o'clock.  But rock around the clock tonight!  Glad Rex, hon, and join me, hon.  We'll have some fun when the clock strikes.  When we're gonna rock around the rock tonight.  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the rock tonight. 
[01:04:30]  We have to.  When the clock strikes two, three, and four.  If the band slows down, we'll yell for more.  We're gonna rock around the rock tonight.  We're gonna rock, rock, rock till broad daylight.  We're gonna rock, gonna rock around the rock tonight.  Yeah, that's Pearl Jam trying to jump on the Obama bandwagon with  Rock Around Barack with Stone Gossard on vocals.  That's his great-grandmother?  Yeah.  What a black...  How do black people never look old?  She probably looks like she's in her late 50s. 
[01:05:00]  She looks like Esther Roll from Good Times.  Times!  She's just holding a live chicken.  You'd think they would ask her to put the chicken down.  It's like your great-great-grandson.  Is trying to lead the free world.  Can we get a photo without the chicken?  Put the chicken down.  I believe that photo would scare potential voters.  Of course it would.  Just a couple generations removed from holding live chickens.  Why do you think that picture's out?  Oh, I understand.  It's to scare potential voters.  I understand that.  They should have taken a picture five minutes later when the chicken's throat was cut. 
[01:05:30]  And she was bleeding it out over photos of Hillary and John McCain.  Throwing some bones on there.  Hey, we played Rock Around Barack because Tim came up with a fine little production piece.  Yeah.  Yeah, because Pearl Jam thought it was a great idea to change one of the rock songs  and to make sense as far as Barack goes.  Yeah.  Well, Tim took that concept and he ran with it.  Introducing the new LP from Going Commie Records, Rock Like Barack.  Here I am. 
[01:06:00]  Barack, you like a hurricane.  Here's some of the greatest tunes of all time set to America's next premiere, Barack Obama.  I want Barack and roll all night and party every day.  Get on the campaign trail and rock like Barack.  Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock and roll high school.  She gets down and ease and hugs me.  Oh, she loves me like Barack.  To get this fabulous new long-playing disc, call toll-free 1-800-GOING-COMMIE. 
[01:06:30]  That's 1-800-GOING-COMMIE.  Barack and roll ain't yours, pollution.  Barack and roll ain't gonna die.  Barack Obama, rock like Barack.  I'm Anthony Cumia and I endorse this product.  Barack of ages, Barack of ages, steel rolling, keep on holding. 
[01:07:00]  Not long enough.  Hey, this is a part two, Jimmy.  We're playing that later.  There's plenty of songs with the word rock in it.  Yeah, well, that's what we're getting at, I guess.  Do you know what I was wondering to myself last night, unless you had a thought, no, I don't have a thought.  I don't know why I hate Hillary as much as I do.  Like, I was listening to Ron and Fez.  And Ronnie was making an interesting point about bipartisanship, whatever, where Democrats and Republicans.  And they were saying that McCain is probably the best out of all the candidates, and Hillary is probably the second best. 
[01:07:30]  Like, she'd be willing to work with Republicans.  And when I think of her and Obama, I really do think that she'd be tougher on terrorism than he would.  I really believe that.  I think that she is probably relatively ballsy when it comes to that.  I don't know why I have this visceral reaction to her.  Because I think she's a phony.  Yeah, she's very insincere.  But a lot of politicians are.  But she doesn't even fake it well.  She's not a good actress.  Yeah, yeah.  I don't know how you get the idea she might be tough on terrorism or something. 
[01:08:00]  I think she's much more pro-Israel.  So, I just think that she would be tougher than him.  And honestly, when dealing with terrorism, I would feel more confident with her than I would with him.  You know what the Republicans should do?  Because this Obama thing is getting a little scary for everybody, on the Republican side especially.  Yeah.  President Bush should come out and endorse Barack Obama. 
[01:08:30]  Barack?  Yeah.  She'd be like, no, don't.  Yeah, he has the same values I do.  Right.  Boy, he just, he's kryptonite.  No one wants him.  Endorsing them?  Stumping.  No.  Yeah.  Yeah, usually the president does his thing.  Yeah, yeah, usually.  If there's Republican candidates out there, the president is out there pushing them.  Right.  No one wants him near them.  No.  That speaks volumes. 
[01:09:00]  All right.  I got to do this just for Jimmy.  Part two.  I hope there's more things that say Barack instead of rock.  You asked for it.  You got it.  Rock like Barack.  Volume two.  Barack in the catapult.  Barack in the catapult.  This gatefold double vinyl set includes all your favorite classic Barack tunes.  This is a pop of Barack in the catapult. 
[01:09:30]  You'll be leading this country and you'll be rocking like Barack.  Oh, oh, amadeus.  Barack me, amadeus.  Oh, oh.  To get this fabulous 2LP set, call 1-800-Going-Kommie right now.  Rock like Barack too.  Yeah, Barack, Barack, Barack, Barack.  Oh, Barack too.  He's out.  We're going to Barack too.  He's out.  We're going to Barack this town.  Rock me inside.  Oh, I'm Anthony Cumia and I endorse this product. 
[01:10:00]  I just pictured Tim.  I think he's having a nervous breakdown in the production room.  He's just insane.  I mean, he's just having a good old time by himself.  All right, we've got to take a break.  And this is what we're going to do.  We're going to continue with politics a little bit more today.  We went back out on the street.  We've been having a lot of success with us.  Yesterday, we sent Pat Duffy.  We're sitting right over there.  Hi, Pat.  Out on the streets of New York.  You went down to what, Penn Station area?  A different part of the city? 
[01:10:30]  Yeah, we first went to Columbus Circle and then Penn Station and Port Authority Bus Terminal.  Oh, perfect.  Much better.  Much better, yeah.  Yeah, and yesterday's theme was basically asking a whole variety of people what is wrong  with America.  Going with that old codger from yesterday that just started spewing about what's wrong with  America.  Going off.  So we're like, you know, that's a good idea.  Let's see what the Irish person thinks is wrong with America and then who they're voting  for as well.  So we'll do a little of that after the break.  Opie and Anthony.  Moving right along. 
[01:11:00]  It's a fast one today.  Opie and Anthony.  You know, Anthony rules.  Well, is insane.  Oh, or that.  Or that.  Rules.  Yes.  Insane.  Yes.  Some people say.  Yesterday you started the show off with a terrific I'm losing my mind rant. 
[01:11:30]  Let me tell you a little bit about that I'm losing my mind rant.  Yes.  I had numerous people come up to me yesterday during my after work activities and say, wow,  thank God for you.  That was very, very important to hear.  Some people were saying that.  So there are supporters out there.  Oh, I have no doubt.  I'm not.  I'm not stupid. 
[01:12:00]  I know people believe just like just like you believe.  Somehow that didn't sound good.  And Derek kind of took your rant and kind of put some, I don't know, some socialist music  to it.  Oh, nice.  Here is this.  Let me tell you something.  Whenever you hear change, big change in Washington, we need change. 
[01:12:30]  It's socialism.  I've had it.  I've had it with Democrats and liberals and people with this dream, this goddamn false dream  that everyone's going to share.  Go to Russia.  Goddamn communists.  They're all communists.  The commies are back from the 80s.  It's the new, improved 21st century communists.  This country's never a place where somebody comes and goes, take care of me. 
[01:13:00]  When the frick did that happen?  It's a place that you work your ass off and you might make it.  Some people will make it.  Some people won't.  Jesus Christ.  That's not friggin' Russia.  Goddamn communists.  I think my favorite part of that is that you think you're going to be in a country  where everybody shares.  Like, it's insane to think that we would help each other. 
[01:13:30]  Like, you're communist fags if you want to help someone who's sick.  Yeah.  Like, I think we need, uh, I think healthcare is ridiculous because I think insurance companies  are raping average middle class people.  Yeah.  Poor people.  What are you, a communist queer?  You're a commie.  I'm not saying take money from the rich people.  Glad we can bring up the commies again.  And you're getting your supporters on instant feedback.  Of course.  I don't like Anthony.  I love him! 
[01:14:00]  Sure.  Beep, beep, beep.  It is.  Well, that leads to Pat Duffy's man on the street interviews that he did yesterday all over  Manhattan.  This is a great time of, uh, a great time in our country to go out and get the voice  of the people.  Sure.  Collect it up.  Sure.  Because, uh, a lot of, um, a change is on the horizon.  And, uh, I want to see what the people are thinking about this.  Absolutely.  So let's get right to it.  We meet, uh, oof, Annalisa.  Annalisa, a Hispanic woman. 
[01:14:30]  Annalisa Martinez.  I'm from El Paso, Texas.  And I'm a musician.  How old are you?  33.  33.  Hispanic musician.  Yep.  And we asked her, uh, what is wrong with the, uh, the country?  What do you think she's going to say, by the way?  We can play along a little bit here.  I think she's going to say she doesn't agree with the immigration policy.  Mm-hmm.  Um, and, uh, probably a problem with the war. 
[01:15:00]  Um.  Why is this weirdo on, on the couch?  But why did he, it's, I'm sorry to interrupt you, but his fans had sit and he squats against  the wall and lowers himself.  Wow.  Have you never sat before?  Hobbit.  You're not Pat Duffy.  Who are you?  Uh, Ron, I'm an intern.  I did, uh, interviews.  But it says, oh.  Interns Pat Duffy.  What?  What is going on?  Uh, Ron and I went out the first time yesterday and, uh, we came back and all of our audio  was botched, so Ron went out by himself again and got these ones. 
[01:15:30]  Oh.  Good for you, Ron.  Now get out of here.  All right.  Now stay right there.  Leave.  When are we going to ask you a question?  Would you not come back?  Uh, no, I would come back.  Would you sit down and just lean against the wall casually?  No, I'd just sit the right way.  That's very comfortable.  Right.  He can't take a nap.  He rests his head on a glass window.  I wish people out there could see he was so nervous standing in the studio.  And when Fan said, sit down, sit down, he sits down against the wall and then he  goes, on the couch.  And then he had to crawl over the, in between the mic and the couch back. 
[01:16:00]  It was awful.  Yeah.  It was really awkward.  Watching a little kid bounce on the couch.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, you got a mic in front of you.  What could you add to this?  Yeah.  Uh, she gives a good answer about who she's voting for.  Yeah.  Like I said, leave.  I think we should let him stay.  I mean, he's trying to bring an audio to the show.  We might need him.  Yeah, you might as well hang out for a little while.  All right.  But hang in the middle.  Away from microphones, please. 
[01:16:30]  Breathing is comfortable.  I like it.  It's really uncomfortable.  All right.  This is what Annalisa had to say.  What do you think is the biggest problem that affects this country?  In my opinion, it's health care and the economy.  Do you have any thoughts of how it could be changed?  Um, the health care issue is really, uh, it's a complicated matter.  Um, but it, something has to be done about it.  Um, people like me, musicians who are freelancers, uh, there's absolutely no way I can afford it. 
[01:17:00]  Uh, okay.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Comment?  Really don't have one.  She made some valid points.  Yeah.  Can't argue.  As a comic, I'm in the same boat.  Oh.  Health care through AFTRA.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, and SAG.  Yes.  But, uh, not, you know, doing gigs.  Radio guys didn't get, uh, good health care until, uh, maybe 10 years ago.  Because after stinks.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  Well, we're in a union here in New York, but I'm talking about all the radio guys that 
[01:17:30]  are, quote, lucky enough to be in a union.  The health care for radio guys and broadcasters was always awful.  So what do you think?  Uh, who's she going to vote for?  Uh, Barack.  Barack all the...  Oh, Hillary health care.  Yeah, Hillary health care.  Hillary health care.  She's pretty much connected to that issue.  If this...  She better say Hillary.  And who will you be voting for?  Uh, I'm a Democrat.  I have to admit I haven't been seduced by other candidates, but I would, uh, be happy if 
[01:18:00]  either of them weren't in my house.  Why is that?  Um, I'm happy with, uh, I'm impressed by both of their, um, ideas and manners of speaking.  Um, I think it's absolutely amazing that we have a woman and an African-American candidate.  So, um, I wouldn't be, um, I wouldn't be impressed if either of them made it to the White House.  Hey, what's your name again?  Uh, Ron.  Did you go to, like, freaking Kansas for these interviews?  No.  What the hell's up with the tornado in the background? 
[01:18:30]  Uh, it was raining yesterday.  That's cool.  Hey, Ron, we'd like you to interview people, uh, on the wing of a taking off 727.  There's nothing to do.  I'll try.  But, Ron, no, Ron made a good point.  When he sat down, he said she gives a good answer about what she's going to vote for.  Yeah.  And, um, so that must be coming up.  Yeah.  All right, let's move on.  Uh, we meet Anthony.  Uh, my name's Anthony.  I'm 25.  I'm from Staten Island, New York, and I own a DJ company. 
[01:19:00]  Ew.  Isn't that awful voice bringing your wedding in?  Yeah.  I say, ew, because I had to work for one of these douches before I made it.  Had to go to their freaking house in the suburbs, and they had their garage filled with equipment,  and then you had to pile all the equipment into your dumb car that barely worked,  and then drive off to some awful gig in the middle of nowhere, and be happy DJ guy.  Sounds fun.  And then walk away with $50.  Sounds like a blast. 
[01:19:30]  For, like, eight hours work.  I hate these guys.  He's, he doesn't sound very, um, stereotypical either.  No.  Anthony, Staten Island, I'm a DJ.  Yeah, are you?  Well, this is what he thinks is wrong with America.  What do you think is the biggest problem facing America today?  The people that are running for the president.  What about them?  I wouldn't vote for any of them except John McCain.  That's who you're going to be voting for in the upcoming election?  Yes, I will.  Sounds like one guy talking to himself.  Yeah, yeah.  What, did you talk to your twin brother? 
[01:20:00]  Who are you going to vote for?  How about too sure?  How about you?  I don't know.  I've decided.  It's conjoined twins just talking to each other.  Country singer in the hat.  Right.  Chattin'.  What's your name again, Joe?  Ron.  I'm sorry, Ron.  Ron.  Excuse me.  Yes.  Oh, Kenny.  Kenny, very jealous that someone else is getting air time.  Yes.  No, no, no.  What's your real name?  I was given the name Hip Hop Ron by Sam.  What?  Hip Hop Ron.  Why, Sam? 
[01:20:30]  Because Kenny gave it to him first.  Oh, Kenny.  Oh.  Kenny, why did you give him Hip Hop Ron?  Why'd you blame it on Sam?  Yeah.  Yeah, no, he's confused.  All right?  He has that name, and he should be proud of that name because that's his lifestyle.  Hold on.  Oh, you live the Hip Hop lifestyle?  No, not really.  I just kind of dress that way.  You got an American people sweatshirt on.  You don't exactly look like you're hunting 50 cents.  A pair of Air Jordans, all right?  Yeah, old school, or where'd you go with the Air Jordans? 
[01:21:00]  What year?  These are the Retro Threes.  Retro Threes.  Whatever.  Okay.  And I said to Kenny, why'd you blame it on Sam?  Yeah, nah.  And then he just started talking.  Kenny, why'd you just give...  Did you come up with the name or did him?  No, no, no.  I was first to call him that, I believe.  Yeah, it was Kenny.  Hip Hop was confused.  Yeah.  And like, you know, everybody has to like always like attach somebody to something. 
[01:21:30]  Right.  So he blamed Sam for the nickname.  And I want to thank Club Soda Kenny because I was thinking to myself, you know, this segment  wasn't going slow enough.  Thank you, Kenny.  Thank you for really slowing this down.  You're welcome.  It's not like we're all sitting in the studio going, oh my God, can we just get through  this segment and regroup?  It's always good to have one of these segments.  It's at quarter to eight because you don't have like a bigger part of your audience.  No, this is like the most listened to part of the radio show, so...  Yeah, but you guys are so talented. 
[01:22:00]  You'll pull this off magnificently.  Mm-hmm.  You sound exactly like the voice in my head.  All right, let's listen to...  This is Hip Hop Ron interviewing Hip Hop Ron about what's wrong with America.  What do you think is the biggest problem facing America today?  The people that are running for the president.  It's the same guy.  You just interviewed yourself, didn't you?  Nah, I didn't.  You couldn't find anybody.  What do you think is the biggest problem facing America today? 
[01:22:30]  The people that are running for the president.  What about them?  I wouldn't vote for anything.  It's the same guy.  I defy you to put this through some kind of forensic sound machine.  You were too scared to interview people.  It's going to be the same exact waveform.  Look, they match perfectly.  It's the same guy.  I think this guy interviewed his sister and then interviewed himself.  Said, here you go, guys.  This is what I did for you.  What do you think is the biggest problem facing America today?  The people that are running for the president. 
[01:23:00]  What about them?  I wouldn't vote for anything except John McCain.  That's who you're going to be voting for in the upcoming election?  Yes, I do.  Because he's better than all the other candidates and other women running the country.  It's the same.  It's like listening to a crazy person just talk to himself.  Oh, my God.  It's the same voice.  Wow.  That's great, man.  Yeah, wonderful.  Do we have time to meet Shannon before we take a break?  Shannon is a what? 
[01:23:30]  A black guy.  Well, I wasn't asking you.  Oh, sorry.  Should we look at me?  I thought it was.  I did look at him.  You did?  I did.  It's hard to come attracted to him.  My name is Shannon Forche.  My age is 34 years old.  I'm currently a full-time student.  He's how old?  34.  And a full-time student?  In high school.  Oof.  Farhead is sweating.  We're all sweating. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, buddy.  This break is so slow, I got swamp ass right now.  I need to get to the bathroom.  I'm like uncomfortable for everybody.  Let's get more of Shannon.  And what do you think is the biggest problem facing America today?  The biggest problem facing America today would be...  He doesn't know.  I would have to say the war.  How would you go about solving that problem?  First, I would go about that by electing people that I believe that have the correct plan of action to correct the problems. 
[01:24:30]  Correctly.  I would go by electing people who are not into the warmongering or in it for self-profit.  I love hearing people that, like, realize, oh, my God, I got to sound really smart right now.  And I can't.  I have three words I can use here.  All right. 
[01:25:00]  Correct.  Correct.  Correctly.  I was watching Henry and Combs the other night.  What did they say about the war?  What can I repeat here?  They might have missed the spirit of this bit.  See, like, I was just personally thinking that when you go out and get audio and you're going to get a bunch of people talking, you're going to get extremes or idiots.  But they went back to the studio and said, anyone that sounds stupid, let's just cut up the smartest sounding, most soft-spoken people.  Yeah, soft-spoken, not crazy.  Just have, these are their opinions.  Yeah, we want raging lunatics. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Or just people that say stupid things.  But what do you think about health care?  Well, I think we need to give health care to all Americans.  Okay, thank you.  We want, yeah, Jimmy's right.  We want people just ranting like that old codger yesterday.  Yeah, you'll get that naturally.  You don't have to go out.  He does say something stupid in the next one.  Oh, okay.  Oh, hey, hip-hop Ron knows.  Hip-hop Ron, that's called a T.  Let's get to it, Ope.  All righty, Jimmy.  And who will you be voting for in the upcoming election?  In the primary, I voted for Hillary, and I plan on voting again for Hillary, primarily 
[01:26:00]  because she actually has a plan of action where I feel Obama, as a Democratic candidate,  just has the selling hope in a bottle.  Hope in a bottle?  And that's what he said there?  That was cool?  I think I, there's somebody that says that they don't, oh, I think that's the wrong guy.  Is there another track to that part?  Oh, my God.  Is there another track to that part?  Oh, my God.  I think that's the wrong guy. 
[01:26:30]  Is there another track to that part?  I don't know.  Is there?  Wow.  What is Hillary's plan?  Hillary's plan calls for actually, I don't understand it completely, but from listening  to her speak, it's the most educated.  I can't really go into the details of it.  Yeah, that was terrific.  You were not kidding, Ron.  That's what we call the payoff.  I'm just, people are slamming hip-hop and his interviews. 
[01:27:00]  They think he sucks.  Thank you all.  He's just soft.  You're soft-spoken, hip-hop.  You really are.  Hip-flop.  Hip-flop Ron.  He is, you're not the most energetic.  I didn't want to go too over the top with it, so I just.  Well, it's all over the top, huh?  I'm just asking for a wake. 
[01:27:30]  I'm very charismatic.  I never want to see you over the top.  Yeah, that's got to be wild.  Right, Jimmy?  Pick that energy up.  It's entertaining.  Did you hear yesterday's interviews?  Yeah.  They were, that's pretty much the perfect example of, you know, what we're looking for.  I thought there were a couple of good ones there, but apparently not.  No, you were right.  The girl had a, like, she's got a good answer.  The problem is you promote these things, like, I hope people pull over, folks.  Yeah.  Jam coming. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  All right, well, it's so bad.  Let's continue.  We meet Janine, a Middle Eastern woman here.  My name is Janine.  I'm 20, a full-time student, college CSI.  Student.  What?  She's on CSI?  What's CSI?  Like the TV show?  Nice.  A lot of youngsters are going into the CSI field.  What does she do?  Because of the TV show.  No, that's the Culinary Institute of, I don't know what it is.  The College of Stein Island.  College of Stein Island.  Is it really? 
[01:28:30]  Is it really?  Yeah, I knew it wasn't CSI.  Yeah, if you say student, you're not doing CSI work.  What do you think is the biggest problem facing America?  We're not all on the same page.  Do you have any thoughts on how we could fix that?  I think the state, Senate, whatever, they all need to seriously sit down and stop thinking  who's a Dominican, I mean, Republican or whatever, so.  Dominican.  Who's a Dominican?  And settle that out.  I like the, yeah, what she said first.  Who's a Dominican? 
[01:29:00]  A Republican, a Dominican, and a Democrat.  A Dominican.  Yeah.  Yeah, Jimmy.  I just, um.  You hate this?  No, I just hate it for our show.  For NPR, this is very informative.  Oh, this would be a big, a big deal for NPR.  Oh, cool.  This would be something that Bob Edwards would love on his show.  Kick hip-hop out.  He sucks.  I think we should give hip-hop a point. 
[01:29:30]  What?  Not good.  Helping someone.  Botulism?  Yeah.  What do you think, Janine, is, what do you think she's going to do in the upcoming election?  Something boring.  Who will you be voting for in the election?  Um, actually, I haven't decided yet.  No, no feelings or anything?  Um, between Hillary and Obama.  Why them two?  Well, I like Hillary because I think her husband did a great job at his time.  Obama's good because he's something new. 
[01:30:00]  But sometimes new is not always good.  Wow.  Yeah.  Look, I'm dozing.  What?  What?  This is awful.  No, it sucks.  Awful audio.  Take you inside the show a little bit.  During the last commercial break, we're all looking around going, wow, man, we're really  having a good one.  We're hitting this show out of the park today.  I liked it.  And I put the voodoo on it because then we come back from break and we get this shit. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, Jesus.  What time is it?  It's only 8 o'clock.  Sorry.  We get this stuff, I should have said.  Yes, Jim.  It's my fault.  It is.  What?  You're taking blame?  When he brought the audio in, I said to God, I dare you to make this suck.  You tasked him.  We're in the suck zone, man.  This is the suck zone, all right.  Who saw this coming?  We're in the suck zone. 
[01:31:00]  A bad bit is coming.  It's already here.  I think we're in the finger of God.  We're in the finger of God right now, people.  You haven't had a rubber glove on it.  Oh.  We were doing so well, man.  What happened?  We're doomed.  We're doomed.  We're in the suck zone, mother hockers.  Linger lunger. 
[01:31:30]  Hey, Ryan, maybe you could let us know if there's an upcoming one that's really good we could get to.  Well, this is the last one.  Part of this segment is, is Than just held up the brakes.  Oh, yeah.  Of course.  Let's meet Ingrid before we take a break.  The last one for today.  My name is Ingrid Tarjan, and I live here in New York City.  Do I have to?  I'm 43.  I am a fitness consultant.  What does that mean?  Consultant. 
[01:32:00]  I don't know.  You say, am I fit?  And she says, yes or no.  And you hand her cash.  Great job.  Stupid.  You're a trainer.  Stop with the fancy names.  Steve from Bayshore.  Just sit there and count.  Yep.  Is saying, I stopped taking notes for the rundown.  Ronnie boy, what do you got on this one?  Come on, let's give this kid a chance.  Yeah, come on, Ron.  Here it is.  He's humiliating himself and us.  Come on, Ron.  It's going to close big.  Here it is.  What do you got?  What do you got?  What do you got with Ingrid?  I was called stupid by her.  What is she, produce a radio show? 
[01:32:30]  And that's how you executive produce.  Hey, let's go to Clutch in Baltimore.  Clutch.  Hey, I don't hate this.  I really don't hate it.  Ron doesn't like boring audio.  He loves it.  Be careful, though.  Oh, you know.  We got the calm hip-hop right now.  We ought to rename this segment.  Call it Mornin Melatonin.  Hip-hop bore. 
[01:33:00]  Drip-hop.  Oh, the economy is stupid.  Sorry, not you personally.  You know what I mean.  But yeah, and obviously,  the pathetic blunder that we did  by going into Iraq.  Do you have any thoughts  of how we could fix that?  I actually maybe have a few thoughts  about the economy.  Iraq is such a blunder  that I'm glad that I'm not  in decision-making mode here.  I don't want that kind of power.  It's just disgusting what happened there  under false pretenses. 
[01:33:30]  But as far as the economy  mandates for better energy policies  that could create jobs  and almost like they had a plan  to send people to the moon,  obviously better education  and just setting policies  in the right way.  It doesn't have to do with taxes.  It has to do with right attitudes  and right intelligent proposals  and execution of them.  Yeah.  You have the right attitude  to don't pay your taxes.  She's, uh... 
[01:34:00]  Her audio is also playing  in Heath Ledger's apartment.  That was part of the cocktail  that killed him.  Well, by the way,  I like the way that Ronnie boy  set it up.  Like, she calls me stupid  and then the first thing  she says is stupid.  Well, not you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, you're stupid.  Yeah, no, I rephrased that.  Yeah.  All right, let's go to Joey  in Maryland.  Joey.  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, don't blame Ron  for this bit.  It's not his fault.  Thank you.  A lot of callbacks there. 
[01:34:30]  I love it.  Love callbacks.  And finally,  the rest of Engvord here.  And who will you be voting for?  Oh, Hillary.  Why?  Why?  Because it's about time  that they put a woman  in this role  and they've done it  in other countries  and it's worked out  formidably  unless they get assassinated.  You dope.  What a dope.  Just go to the gym  and practice counting.  So she's just voting  based on sex.  Oh, yeah, of course.  That's it.  Let's go to Mongo  the trucker.  Mongo. 
[01:35:00]  If this bit were in Japan,  people leaving the studio  would be going  yip, yip, yip, yip.  Linger longer.  That's a good one.  Well, we learned what?  We should bring everyone on  board with that.  We learned in Japan  if something's really good,  they sit there in silence.  Yes.  So if this was in Japan,  there'd be a lot of yip, yip  because this sucks, right?  Okay.  Hey, thanks, Hip Hop Ron,  for what I really don't know,  but can't wait  for your next appearance  on this fine radio show.  Oh, yeah.  You know, we were starting 
[01:35:30]  to think that the ratings  were getting a little too high.  You know, we wanted  to bring them down  a little bit  and you accomplished  that for us today  and I greatly,  holy yes.  I felt like there were  too many people listening.  Yeah.  And it's good  that we drove some away  to other stations.  You want to thin the herd  every once in a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Start over again.  It keeps the challenge up.  All right.  And I blame Steve  because you're the executive producer  and somewhere in your dumb brain  you thought this would be good.  And that's how you  bore the audience.  Did you actually hear this before?  No, I gave it to you.  Why would you? 
[01:36:00]  Why would I?  I delegated responsibility.  How is no one hearing this  before it goes on the air?  Oh, plenty of people  are hearing it.  I just gave it to Sam.  You do realize  this is a college kid.  Yeah.  You know.  Is he leaving all dejected?  Oh.  Where was he going?  What is he doing?  Were you trying to leave  through the cabinet?  Were you going to choke  someone or E-Rock?  It's a visual,  but the guy gets up,  he starts walking behind E-Rock,  there's a cabinet there  with two huge cabinet doors  and he attempted  to leave the studio  through a cabinet.  Than was motioning to me 
[01:36:30]  so I thought he was talking to me  so I went to talk to me.  He thought it was the elevator.  Oh my God.  Than was motioning to you.  Than wouldn't motion to you  for anything.  No.  He would motion to someone else  to motion to you.  Yeah.  We have no one monitoring.  Because yesterday  we had the intern  beep the word bitch  when he's allowed.  Yeah, pretty much the interns  are producing the radio show  at this point.  No, this was handed in.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  What happened with?  This was handed in to Sam.  I believe he cut it down  from 24 tracks  to whatever we had today. 
[01:37:00]  Wow.  There were 20 worst tracks?  It was,  I had to cut out  probably 10 tracks  and there are more at XM  if we want to hear more audio.  No.  This is the very best  of Hip Hop Run.  Wow.  All right.  Well, sometimes we find  things people can do  and sometimes  we find things people can't do.  Glad I can mess up the show.  I am.  You're more of a  get my coffee type of guy. 
[01:37:30]  Oh.  In fairness,  in fairness,  he'd probably screw that up too.  All right,  we're going to...  Hold on,  before we go,  can I ask Ron real quick?  Oh, God.  Is there something  that you feel you're...  Because I don't want to feel  like the guy can't ever  do anything on the air  because he had one  horrendous flub.  Is there something else  that you think  you might be able  to bring to the show  audio-wise?  I think if I did this again,  I'd be able to get a better 
[01:38:00]  because that was my first time  I did that, so...  Second chance?  He's saying that you had  kind of like a freshman...  Yeah.  Yeah.  What?  Pretty much.  Freshman luck.  Swing and miss.  Okay.  Actually,  two different analogies,  but...  It really wasn't that bad.  I mean,  it shouldn't have  seen the light of day.  And I have to clear things up.  You did okay  asking the questions out there.  I have to clear something up  because a lot of people  are under the assumption...  No,  nothing was dumped out of  during that segment.  They think all the good stuff 
[01:38:30]  got dumped out of.  No,  that went undumped.  Well,  me saying holy ass  because I just  couldn't help myself anymore.  Well,  probably just that,  yes.  Which they should have  kept in to maybe  keep people tuned in.  Wow,  did he say that?  Kind of a thing.  Yeah,  why don't we regroup?  Thank you,  hip-hop Ron.  Can we send Ron out  to do something else  and give him one more chance?  Sure.  All right,  cool.  Sure.  And as we go to break,  Grammy's right around the corner,  so we got this Grammy Minute,  Grammy Moment,  whatever the hell  we're calling it.  We got Big A,  our own Big A,  helping us out on this one. 
[01:39:00]  It's an Opie and Anthony  Grammy Minute.  Song of the Year.  Hey there,  Delilah,  playing White Tees.  Hey there,  Delilah,  don't you worry  about the distance  right there.  If you get lonely,  there's a song  another listening.  Close your eyes.  Listen to my voice,  it's my disguise.  I'm by your side.  Expand your Grammy 
[01:39:30]  knowledge base  with Opie and Anthony.  Yeah!  Opie and Anthony.  I, um,  I just got a Google alert  for Opie and Anthony.  Yeah.  And when these come in,  I get,  I go into a panic. 
[01:40:00]  It's never like,  we just want to write a story  on Opie and Anthony  and how great they are  at broadcasting.  Yeah.  It's always some horrific thing  that we thought was past us.  You know?  Yeah.  So when I get the Google alert  for Opie and Anthony,  yeah, absolutely.  You get,  I go into panic mode.  I get a little scared,  but, uh,  I'm, um,  I'm happy today  because it says,  uh,  it's from Plymouth  Evening Herald  in the UK. 
[01:40:30]  Matthew Nill,  Opie,  also scored four goals.  Goals,  excuse me.  And Oliver Vickery,  a brace as Morley  beat Woodford  six to two.  So it's just  some soccer dude.  Yeah.  Named Opie.  So we're okay today.  Yeah,  I love when those come in.  It's good to know.  You read it and go,  what the hell is that?  What did we do now?  That's what I think  as soon as I see  the Opie and Anthony Google alert.  What did we do now?  I don't know.  You click on it.  Who's mad at us now? 
[01:41:00]  Who's trying to get us fired?  Is it Breitbart?  Those no-gooders  had Breitbart?  No-gooders.  But today,  it's just a soccer dude  from the UK.  Hey, um,  we talked about this  after the Super Bowl,  and, uh,  we were,  we, uh,  we hit this one  right on the,  on the old head.  Hmm.  There were a lot of, uh,  sweatshirts and T-shirts  and baseball caps  that were printed  that said, uh,  you know,  Patriots,  Super Bowl champions.  Oh, yeah.  Patriots 19-0. 
[01:41:30]  All that,  all that stuff,  right?  Mm-hmm.  You have to print that up  in advance  because people want to  buy immediately.  The second it happens.  And we always wondered  where that crap,  you know,  went  if the team didn't win  in the end.  I just assumed  they would just  burn the stuff,  throw it through  a shredder  or something.  But no,  they actually find people  that would actually  wear something  that's not true.  And, uh,  it,  it's this place  that I can't pronounce  and I,  I better just,  uh,  let Anthony, 
[01:42:00]  uh,  read the,  uh,  the headline.  Oh.  Because I'm going  to get us fired  because I,  for some reason  I just pronounced  it, uh,  the wrong way.  Oh.  And I,  and I'm not,  uh,  racist like Anthony,  so that would be  really bad if,  hey.  You,  you pronounce it  like you're talking  about a guy  named Rockwa.  Nick?  Right.  Uh.  Yes.  Ra.  Yeah.  Wah.  There it is.  Uh,  the poor over there,  they get the,  the Pat's tees. 
[01:42:30]  They're the ones  wearing them now?  Yes.  Uh,  the Giants,  maybe America's  Super Bowl champs.  Yuck.  Well,  speaking of which,  by the way,  TMZ.com yesterday  had a hilarious clip  Eli Manning  and the boys,  they were like,  you know,  going to some club  in New York  and they all came out  and Eli Manning  was with his,  uh,  with his,  uh,  girlfriend.  I think they're  kind of calling her  a supermodel too,  but she's,  uh,  she falls short  of supermodel status  and one of these  dopey paparazzi dudes,  he goes to Eli Manning. 
[01:43:00]  Um,  well,  what was the exact quote?  I don't want to mess it up.  Oh,  would you rather have  a Super Bowl ring  or a supermodel girlfriend?  And so the supermodel  girlfriend,  you know,  obviously threw the bird up  like,  F you.  What did he say?  I think he just laughed.  He thought it was funny.  Uh,  he's laughing  and she's flipping the bird.  Yeah.  Eli's,  uh,  girlfriend to TMZ,  you giant douche.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Can't say the B part  of the douche thing.  Uh,  so what's more important?  Super Bowl MVP Eli Manning, 
[01:43:30]  the Super Bowl ring  or a supermodel?  Yeah,  we asked it  and Eli's fiancee  was none too happy.  He should have said,  uh,  I have both.  Would have been nice.  She would have been felt  all,  uh,  warm and fuzzy.  I'm thinking he would say  Super Bowl ring,  by the way.  Yeah,  totally.  Totally,  right?  Yeah.  Because with that,  you get the supermodel.  She'll do what you want her to do  and then you kick her out of the car.  You know,  look at this ring,  stupid slobber on it  while I hold it.  You don't need that data. 
[01:44:00]  God,  she's added nothing.  So,  uh,  Nick,  uh,  Ragwa poor.  Uh,  yes.  Okay.  The Giants may be America's  Super Bowl champs,  but there will still be  one place in the world  where the Patriots'  sorry dreams  of a perfect season  live on.  Nicaragua.  As soon as the gear arrives,  poor children across  this fine country  will be transformed  into unwitting  members of  Patriots'  nation. 
[01:44:30]  So they're all  going to be walking around  wearing these  dopey shirts  that  Super Bowl champions,  19 and 0.  Don't make any sense.  No.  I would love  to see that.  And people probably  don't even know,  though.  Do you think,  like,  uh,  people in this country  are walking around  with shirts about  soccer teams  that,  that lost  and we don't even know?  In the World Cup,  see?  Yeah.  In the,  uh,  the World Cup.  I gotta see pictures.  That's a picture that I bet  you they're trying to get.  Uh,  she said, 
[01:45:00]  uh,  that the people in,  uh,  Nick,  uh,  Ragwa probably won't know  who the Patriots are  or the meaning of 19 and 0.  So there's your answer.  They don't care what team name  is on it,  she said.  They don't know about football.  Some of these people have never  had a new piece of clothing  in their lives.  They will wear them  until they are,  uh,  threadbare.  You're gonna make cookies  out of them?  Cut them up and eat them?  Yeah.  So that's where all that stuff  went to.  Good.  All right.  Good for them.  I think we pretty much  did everything we needed to  as far as current stuff 
[01:45:30]  goes today.  Uh,  Iran paying for transsexuals  to undergo sex change  operations?  What?  Oh,  they're hunting down  the gays in Iran,  but they're,  uh,  paying for transsexuals  to undergo sex change  operations.  They're wrecking the trannies.  I mean,  that's good.  Why is that?  Why are they doing that?  I know they're not very  tolerant of the,  uh,  gays in Iran.  I don't know.  There were too many words  I couldn't pronounce  in the news story,  so I had to give up  on that one.  Want me to see it?  Huh?  Want me to try it?  Well,  it's,  you know,  it's like axis of, 
[01:46:00]  uh,  they're calling it  axis of sheevil.  Sheevil.  Oh,  I get it.  All right.  Yeah,  there were too many,  like,  words in that one.  Um,  uh,  uh,  uh,  uh,  uh,  yeah,  I see.  Jimmy for everybody.  Iran has been called  many things,  but a progressive nation  isn't one of them.  But while bearded morality  police race around the nation  condemning homosexuals 
[01:46:30]  to death  and flogging women  whose headscarves  they deem too revealing,  the fervently conservative  Islamic Republic  is happy to pay  for transsexuals  to undergo  sex change operations.  They are not to blame,  uh,  Hassan Boussavi  Shalak of Iran's  state welfare organization  told Bloomberg News.  They have rights  such as every other citizen.  What,  what is with the tolerance  with,  uh,  them?  Well,  you know,  I've,  I've heard that,  uh,  a lot of people  over there  enjoy the tranny.  They enjoy the tranny.  Really?  Yes.  That's what I've heard 
[01:47:00]  in,  in that region.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Tranny is a popular  mythical creature.  Ah,  kind of like a unicorn.  Almost exactly.  It's like a girl  with a unicorn  under her dress.  She has magic powers.  Yes.  One wave of the wand,  you don't sit for a week.  Is that what it is?  All right.  I don't know what I thought.  Ah,  you know.  Hey,  uh,  Josh from Albuquerque  writes,  wow,  so we shipped them  the crap that we can't  use anymore.  Well,  can we ship, 
[01:47:30]  uh,  hip hop rod?  Oh,  yeah,  that was useless.  Yeah.  All right.  Kind of killed  the whole show today.  Let's be honest.  We're going to get  a C plus  and we were heading  toward an A.  And really,  uh,  broke out of the gate.  Hey,  uh,  Black History Month,  today's honoree.  Yes.  Let's see who this is.  Black History Month  is upon us,  February and,  uh,  every year.  Uh,  the same old shows  drag out the same  old,  uh,  cast characters 
[01:48:00]  for Black History Month  and do a little,  a little tribute to them.  Martin Luther King,  George Washington Carver,  Malcolm X,  peanut guy,  Frederick Douglass,  well,  that was George Washington Carver.  I like him as peanut guy.  I'm just trying  to keep the bit going,  Anthony.  I like when you just say peanut guy.  I like peanut guy, too.  I felt I was overusing peanut guy.  What else did he do?  Um,  um,  ah,  peanut guy,  all right.  Peanut butter,  because it was just jelly and butter  and people were like, 
[01:48:30]  this kind of sucks.  Does I have an idea?  I got this idea  about mashing up peanuts.  Before him,  they were just eating brittle.  He said,  why don't you throw  some peanut sauce on that?  He said,  okie doke, sir.  Who are you?  What a contribution  he's made.  Who's this magical man  with a bag of peanuts  freshening up our treats?  So many ways to use them.  People were just  popping them in their mouths  and chewing them  and swallowing.  Yes.  And then George Washington Carver  said,  no,  you could mash him up  and spread it on some bread. 
[01:49:00]  That's right.  So he didn't even invent  the peanut?  No,  the peanut was around.  He invented  like ways of  taking oil out of it  and making it  be peanutty buttery.  He invented the peanut.  Before him,  Charles Schultz  was drawing a cartoon  called  Oh my God.  Can you do that line again? 
[01:49:30]  Yes.  Yeah.  Yes.  I certainly will.  I was proud of that one.  He invented the peanut.  Before him,  Charles Schultz  was drawing a cartoon  called  Well,  it wasn't named yet,  obviously.  Oh boy.  I think we're heading  into silly mode.  Well,  we like paying tribute  to African Americans  that don't really  get the recognition  they are so due. 
[01:50:00]  Sure.  Yeah.  Amen.  In honor of  Black History Month,  the Opie and Anthony Show  is honoring black heroes.  African American individuals  throughout history  without whom  this country  would not be  the melting pot  it is today.  Today we honor  actor Michael Dorn  who starred as  the mighty Klingon  Lieutenant Commander Worf  in 175 episodes  of Star Trek  The Next Generation.  That is how 
[01:50:30]  the Klingon  lures a mate.  Little known fact,  Michael Dorn  played Apollo Creed's  bodyguard  in the original  Rocky film.  Stay tuned  for more icons  of black history  on the Opie and Anthony  show.  There you go.  Oh,  we should have ended  with the scream again.  Well,  there's today's  honoree.  That's a good one.  Worf.  These guys got to  come up with a new one  every day.  Every day.  I think it's easy.  I think we could probably  do it for a year.  Yeah?  Oh,  absolutely.  All right.  Hey, 
[01:51:00]  let's try to squeeze this in.  Magic Highway.  Ooh.  Danny says,  this is terrific.  We love these films  from the old days.  This is from 1958.  What a time of innocence.  What a time of  prosperity  in this country.  Hope.  Dreams.  Dreams.  Anti-communist sentiment.  Mm-hmm.  Racism.  Oh,  I was saying,  I was talking about  good things. 
[01:51:30]  I'm sorry.  I didn't want to  slip up there.  oof.  Years.  1958 Disney short  about the possible  advancement of America's  highway system.  The highways and  byways.  Vehicles.  Some of the predictions  they make are highly  accurate and others  are simply  irresistible.  Absurd.  Here's the first one.  Speed,  safety,  and comfort  will be the keynotes  of tomorrow's highways.  And no 
[01:52:00]  Negroes.  You just know  that's what he's  thinking.  It's the 50s.  They were very racist.  There's segregation  going on back then.  You're going to have  the music ready now?  Yeah.  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  I like the music.  Keynotes of  tomorrow's highways.  A multicolored  highway system  may enable  the motor...  Really?  I guess you were  wrong, Anthony.  I was wrong.  No, he wasn't.  You need somebody  to flip the bird  at as you're driving.  Multicolored 
[01:52:30]  highway system.  White people  in the cars.  And of course,  the tar is black.  That's about the only  multicolor we'll get.  The stripes  white.  You'll be in the  back of the car  while someone else  drives it.  If you know  what I mean.  I'll be going  to the store.  Let me hear more.  Highway system  may enable 
[01:53:00]  the motorist  to reach his  destination  by following  the correct  color strip.  The increased  speed of  tomorrow's automobile  will demand  that highway signs  be larger  and more simple  to read  so that the  motorist  can anticipate  his moves  well in advance.  Better visibility  will be featured  in new highway  designs.  As day dims  into night,  electric eyes  automatically  illuminate  the way ahead.  Radiant heat 
[01:53:30]  will keep  the highway  surfaces dry.  Rain,  ice,  and snow.  Really?  Where's that  power coming from?  If visibility  is poor,  our windshield  becomes a radar  screen,  showing the outline  of objects ahead.  Shut up.  Or fog  may be eliminated  by dispelling  devices along  the right-of-way.  The right-of-way.  Um, you know  what?  He's right about  the things 
[01:54:00]  lighting up in a way  we have those  reflective, uh,  things.  Ah, true,  reflectors on the  road.  And, you know  what, on Cadillacs,  they don't have it  on all of them,  but you can see  the outline of  things.  There's a certain,  I don't have it  in my car,  but there's a  certain display,  it almost works,  like, you know  how a projection  screen, it  projects it  against the  windshield.  Like a heads-up  display.  Yeah, and you  can see, like,  uh, um, you  can see readouts  that are things  about going on  in the car,  like the dashboard  on the window.  But I do think  they're right about  that, it just  hasn't happened  yet. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  How about a  punchline?  Yes.  To fill the  potholes.  One, if you  slice them thin  enough.  One, if you  slice them thin  enough.  An empty boat.  Here's more 
[01:55:00]  from 1950.  Guilty.  Dashboard panels  featuring built-in  safety controls  and electronic  operating devices  are predictions  for tomorrow.  A teletype panel  shows up to the  minute traffic  bulletins.  The recommended  safe driving speed  is automatically  indicated.  Our rear-view  mirror is actually  a television picture.  Wow, look at 
[01:55:30]  that.  I put my truck  in reverse and I  get a little TV  picture of the  back of the car.  Makes parking a  breeze.  Like Danny said,  some of the stuff  very accurate and  others just  completely insane.  Just horse crap.  Yeah.  Not only the  rear-view video  screen on that  one, but also the  real-time traffic  updates.  I thought that  was pretty good.  But you have to  read it as you're  driving down the  highway.  Well, you think  there's a teletype.  Like it's going  to actually come out  with paper.  Beep, beep, beep,  beep, beep.  And out of the  paper ticker, you  will get traffic  reports.  Beep, beep, beep, 
[01:56:00]  in Morse code.  All right, we've  got to take a quick  break and then we'll  continue with this  look at the future  from 1950.  The future.  Opie and Anthony.  All right, where  were we?  I know we're doing a  radio show.  Yeah.  The highway.  Huh?  Ah, yes.  Ah, the highway.  The highways of the  future.  Eww.  Eww.  They did get a couple  of things right like  that.  Yeah, it's the magic  highway. 
[01:56:30]  Yes.  The Hershey  Highway.  I'm kind of bummed we  didn't get the Larry  King thing on the radio  today.  Maybe before we get  out of here.  Press the button,  pull the chain,  out comes the  chocolate choo-choo  train.  Magic Highway.  This is a little  Disney short from  1958 predicting the  future of the car  and the highway.  Yes.  All right, as we  move along here,  highway construction  vehicles will build  highways almost 
[01:57:00]  instantly.  What is that about?  They do have those  big trucks that  just kind of drive  and roll the road  out right behind  it.  You think that's  what the...  Maybe.  Unless they're  thinking, no, we  grow them with  seeds.  That would be  ridiculous.  They're thinking  in cartoon terms.  Yeah.  Unless it's in  Long Island on the  Long Island Expressway.  Yeah, exactly.  In which case,  they'll jigsaw  puzzle little pieces  of gravel together. 
[01:57:30]  Exactly.  It would take  years.  Highways built  instantly.  They obviously  didn't tell this  to the mafia.  No.  Takes a long  time.  Sorry, I love  the mafia.  They took care  of me.  Who doesn't?  They're good  people.  Here's the  question.  In one sweep,  a giant road  builder changes  rough ground  into a wide  finished highway.  Prefabricated  bridges and  overpasses move  immediately into  place. 
[01:58:00]  Combining new  formulas of  concrete with  quick setting  ceramic materials,  a mobile kill is  supported by the  bridge it builds.  What?  It spits a bridge  out the back?  That's interesting.  For tunneling  through mountains,  this atomic reactor  applying incredible  heat literally melts  the hard ones as it  makes bullseels out  of mountains.  Here is preserved  the beauty and  grandeur of mountain  travel with the use  of cantilevered  skyways.  Wonderful. 
[01:58:30]  We're using nuclear  reactors to melt  through the  mountainsides.  Yes.  As you drive  through the tunnel,  look at those  sights of the  children that look  like they're from  the hills have  eyes.  Because they are.  Nuclear reactor.  As you drive  through the tunnel,  watch as your  testicles shrink to  nothing.  That's radiation  at work. 
[01:59:00]  Look at your  loved one and  check for broken  bones.  You can see right  through them.  Radiation and me.  Yes.  Radiation is healthy  for you too.  And make sure to  spark up a lucky  strike in one of  these tunnels.  You won't need  matches.  Just touch it to  the wall.  The molten rock  will light your  cigarette.  look out for the  grape-faced man.  That radiation's a 
[01:59:30]  bitch.  And they would  just spit out  bridges from the  back of a  construction table?  Yes.  Mobile kiln in the  back will actually  cook a bridge and  have it spit out  the back.  Isn't that  interesting?  It will actually  make a bridge that  you can then drive  over instantly.  Sounds safe,  doesn't it?  No inspectors  necessary. 
[02:00:00]  We got to get  more of this audio  on.  And here comes  the Patrice O'Neill  machine to burn  that bridge.  Get it?  He burns  bridges.  Bling-a-lung.  Bling-a-lung.  Bling-a-lung.  Cars will be  washed,  dried,  and filled up  in the  family garage.  No way.  With the advent  of wider,  faster expressways,  the commuter's  radius will be 
[02:00:30]  extended many miles.  America will  someday be  crisscrossed by  a network of  super-speed  transcontinental  motorways.  Tomorrow's living  in spacious,  well-planned  communities will  be closely  integrated with  the highway  system.  In the private  motor port,  the family  car is  automatically  washed,  dried,  and refueled.  As father  chooses the  route in  advance on a  push-down  selector,  electronics take  over complete  control. 
[02:01:00]  Progress can be  accurately checked  on a  synchronized  scanning map.  With no  driving responsibility,  the family  relaxes together.  Oh, man.  Well, they  predicted the  GPS, though,  right there.  They have the  navigation system,  but keep your  hands on the  wheel, people.  Right.  We've all heard  the story of the  guy that had the  motorhome and put  it on cruise  control and then  went back to  eat.  Urban legend.  Snopes.com.  Yes, your car will  be washed and  fueled up and 
[02:01:30]  maintained in your  own garage by  Negroes.  This is the  50s, after all.  Yes, please, let's  keep reiterating the  fact that we're  talking about a  horrid time in  history.  The 50s.  Your car will act  as a bomb shelter  as it is made out of  tons of steel and  concrete driving  down the road. 
[02:02:00]  They had some  wacky ideas.  The whole navigation  system thing,  though, that's  pretty good.  They nailed it, and  they have been  talking about where  you could just let  go of the steering  wheel.  Yes, recently, cars  that drive themselves,  sensors in the roads.  Sensors in the roads  and then sensors in  the cars to keep  them apart from  each other.  That would be the  oddest thing,  though, is giving  up control, like  sitting in the  driver's seat of a  car and then all  of a sudden just  kind of not paying  attention and hoping 
[02:02:30]  that everything works.  Well, in the event  that it doesn't, I  mean, the idea that  machines can, because  machines don't get  drunk, machines  don't doze, their  eyes don't get  tired.  They're boring.  Yeah.  They don't get  drunk.  Machines don't like it  with fat chicks,  either.  I love the fact that  this guy said,  father will program,  I just love that they  had that.  While mother cooks the  brownies.  Are you ridiculous?  We can't leave a  machine to mother. 
[02:03:00]  She'll screw it all  up and father will  have to punch her  again.  If mother gets  lippy, a little fist  comes out of the  glove compartment and  punches her in the  face, freeing dad's  hands up to steer and  pat junior on the head  so he doesn't turn  into a homosexual.  Wow.  It's mother's time.  She's being a bitch. 
[02:03:30]  Father doesn't want her  here.  She can be put in the  trunk, if need be.  You don't want to be  around a woman during  that time.  Here comes Aunt Flo  to visit.  Ready for the next  clip?  Oh, please.  All right.  Advances in technology  will give us more time  for leisure in  tomorrow's living.  The family vacation  will always be decided 
[02:04:00]  by a family vote,  but getting there will  be simplified by a  punched card system,  and the car is  automatically operated  and guided to  preset destinations.  A punch card.  Highly specialized  pleasure vehicles will  have every convenience  of home.  Today's insurmountable  barriers and sheer  cliffs will be scaled  by highway escalators.  One minute, our car  is a highway vehicle.  Next, a cabin cruiser.  What the hell is that? 
[02:04:30]  Did they actually have  like an escalator that  you drive your car on  and it lifts it up the  mountain?  They didn't really show  that part of it.  They were just kind of  like the voiceover.  Even we thought that  was silly.  There was a lot of  very Jetson-like things  that they were trying  to predict, like parking.  Parking, like you'd drive  your car onto a platform  and it would lift up to  your office type of thing.  It was just absolutely  ridiculous.  Like me, it's serious,  Robert.  Yeah, rumor has it 
[02:05:00]  there's an elevator for  the escalator.  I want to do the next  clip.  Wow.  Yeah, I like the  escalator.  Highway and automotive  design will move  forward together.  First, we'll have the  more efficient gas  turbine car.  Then the speedier jet.  All right.  Jet.  What were they smoking?  Then strap a jet  rocket onto it so you  can drive into an  abutment.  Another urban legend.  Right.  Can we go into a time  machine and steal their 
[02:05:30]  pot?  They got some good  stuff back then.  And then, of course,  the nuclear-powered car.  Yeah.  Hopefully, everything in  the future will have a  nuclear reactor strap to  it and we'll all glow in  the dark.  Didn't we know crap  about radiation?  You won't have to worry  about hair care products.  We'll all be bald.  There will be no people  left because reproduction  will be impossible.  They loved their nuclear 
[02:06:00]  reactors back then.  Gas turbine car.  Then the speedier jet.  The inexhaustible atom.  And possibly the sun-powered  electro-suspension car.  Stop it.  Which needs no wheels.  These spectacular  conceptions will lead to  new dimensions for the  American highway.  brought to you by  Monsanto.  It's like a Disney ride  when you go through it 
[02:06:30]  and then go, yeah,  horse crap.  Yeah.  It's that Twilight Zone  music when the guy's  going to work.  ...which today  seems sheer fantasy  will be commonplace  to future generations.  There will be miles  of tubular highways.  Air-conditioned routes  across hot desert  wastelands.  Over sub-freezing  mountain ranges. 
[02:07:00]  And even under the ocean.  Sorry.  Yes, it's the future.  Yes, air-conditioned roadways.  That won't take too much power.  Thank God we have  nuclear reactors.  And the car of the future  will also have  automatic locking doors  and rolling-up windows  for driving through  neighborhoods full of  Negroes.  Hey, remind the people  of 2018-78.  That's the future.  Okay.  Thank you, Steve. 
[02:07:30]  Very funny line  from fellow racist  Steve C.  Oh, no.  It's Steve from Mayshore.  Yes, sorry.  I'm not a racist.  I'm a homosexual.  Get it right.  I prefer white,  but I'll go black  and unclipped  if I have to.  What did we miss there?  Because we turned off  the mics.  We were all like  kind of chatting there.  I think we missed  the air-conditioned outdoors. 
[02:08:00]  That's crazy.  It'll be cool  around hot highways  in the desert.  Yeah.  And finally...  Thanks to coal.  We got one more clip.  This is from 1958,  a little Disney short.  These giant arteries  will link together  all nations  and help create  a better understanding  among the peoples  of the world.  As in the past,  the highway will continue  to play a vital role  in the progress 
[02:08:30]  of civilization.  It will be our magic carpet  to new hopes,  new dreams,  and a better way of life  for the future.  For white people.  Well,  that was 50 years ago,  so here we are  in the future.  We're the future men.  Let's look out the window.  There's a road  made of tar.  Yeah.  And there's cars  driving on it.  Oh,  they look a little nicer.  But we're still steering  and stepping on gas pedals  and brake pedals. 
[02:09:00]  We're pretty much  doing the same  goddamn thing.  We do have the conveniences  of navigation systems  and the assistance of...  That's barely a year old,  though.  Yeah,  I know.  We just got that.  Right.  I'm just glad  that the highways of America  have really brought  all the cultures together  and we could live in peace.  Yeah,  that's what happens.  Because of all these  future highways.  Well,  the highways of America  are bringing nations  together.  Someday they will span  all countries.  And the first one  I want is a huge  one-way tunnel  from here to Africa. 
[02:09:30]  It's 1958.  Yes,  remember,  1958 we're talking about,  not here.  And I'm doing a character  like Mr. Amos.  Oh,  I can't even say that anymore.  No,  no,  no.  Mule Spanker  from Wackback.  We'd like to play  What Did We Learn  on the show  late in the show,  but we're running out of time,  but I want to get this one  on the radio.  He learned that  hip-flop Ron  is the wrong  kind  of intern. 
[02:10:00]  Linger longer.  Linger longer.  All right,  the show's over,  but not your participation  in the Opie and Anthony  experience.  We're going over to XM,  so we do a little more radio.  If you're not joining us  over there,  I just want to remind you  that we're sending  Sam and Big A  to the NBC  Knight Rider premiere  party at the Playboy Mansion,  and we want you to join them.  Now,  this is what you've got to do  probably on a regular basis.  Later on in the day,  you've got to go to  ONAradio.com.  Stephen S.  from Bayshore  does a great rundown,  and all the stuff we talk about  that is very visual, 
[02:10:30]  we make sure we have  all the links up there for you.  It's a great place to go  after the radio show,  and also to catch up  on what you might have missed  if you're only catching  a part of the show.  As I say that,  you also can go to  ONAradio.com  to sign up to win this trip  to the Playboy Mansion  with our own Sam and Big A.  And don't forget,  watch the Knight Rider movie event  Sunday,  February 17th  on NBC.  Yeah.  On WN!  BC.  This Friday and Saturday, 
[02:11:00]  I'll be at Bananas  in Poughkeepsie,  845-462-3333.  Two shows Friday,  two shows Saturday.  Bananas in Poughkeepsie.  I want to get some  Bananas, Jimmy.  Yeah, you should.  You're going to be up there.  We'll see.  I would like to do that.  Why don't you?  I get lonely.  It's just me and Kenny.  I think we're going to,  I think me and my girl  are going to fit,  fit that into our  Muff and Muff weekend. 
[02:11:30]  You're what?  Well,  every once in a while  we have a  Muff and Muff weekend.  A Muff  and Muff weekend?  Oh boy.  What, Jimmy?  What's wrong?  What is that?  My mouth is dry.  What's wrong with  the Muff and Muff weekend?  Can I list things  and then bring them  to the show tomorrow morning?  Sure. 
[02:12:00]  We start at 6?  All right,  we can do that.  Hey guys,  we had fun today.  Thank you.  80% of the show  was just terrific today  and if you were listening  to the 20% that sucked,  I'm really sorry.  We apologize for that.  Yeah,  it's Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Opie and Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  Thank you. 
[02:13:00]  Thank you. 
[02:13:30]  Thank you. 
[02:14:00]  Thank you. 
[02:14:30]  Thank you. 
[02:15:00]  Thank you. 
[02:15:30]  Thank you. 
[02:16:00]  Thank you. 
[02:16:30]  Yeah, well.  New Mania, what's up?  Hey, gentlemen.  Little Jimmy, I want to let you know tomorrow I'm buying your new upcoming tickets to your show in Pontiac, Michigan.  Oh, cool, man.  Oh, yeah.  A bunch of tickets will go on sale tomorrow.  I'll announce them later.  I probably should have had that information, but I don't know if we have it. 
[02:17:00]  10 a.m., 10 a.m.  They go on sale on Ticketmaster, but there's a lot of info on your MySpace.  Oh, is there really?  Thank you.  Maybe someone can print my MySpace page.  I got tickets for Seattle, for just a bunch of places, Portland, Oregon, fucking a whole bunch of markets go on sale.  Detroit, it's the second half of the tour.  So I will announce that a little later.  Thank you, sir, because I totally forgot.  Looking forward to it, gentlemen.  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:30]  Thank you.  There's a relationship expert on the Today Show.  So please see if that's worth getting into today.  Jealousy is more common in cohabitation than in marriage.  Is jealousy ruining your relationship?  Once you're married, you don't give a flying fuck.  Jealousy has led over one-third of people to want to hurt somebody.  Almost one in three women experience conflict resulting from jealousy at some point during relationships. 
[02:18:00]  But she's a relationship expert.  Talking about jealousy.  I would love to find out.  Is jealousy killing your relationship?  I would love to find out that this relationship expert has a guy that is just completely cheating on her behind her back.  And miserable.  Oh, God.  I would love to find that out.  All right.  We're going to see if that audio is worth playing today.  Jealousy.  Hey, Than's not here today because he's getting his physical.  We're getting very, very close to our blockbuster trade.  And it's very obvious to everyone that Than and Sam will be leaving the opening Anthony show and going to the Ron and Fez show. 
[02:18:30]  Do you think it's going to be them?  Yeah, absolutely.  We're just hoping that Than passes the physical so we can make that part of the blockbuster trade that's going down soon with Ron and Fez.  Now, who do we get in return?  Well, Ronnie...  Because the likes of Than and Sam, that's pretty high.  Well, Ronnie insists on throwing Earl into any trade.  That's a detriment, though.  Yeah.  That we need something better.  Which means, we could say no to the blockbuster trade, but Ronnie's saying Earl has to go. 
[02:19:00]  Earl has to be part of the blockbuster trade.  We're throwing Than and Sam as trade bait out there.  He's giving us Earl, which means he's going to have to give us a lot more people to make up for the fact that he's throwing Earl.  We all know that, right?  Can't we just have him keep Earl and we'll take an incompetent to be named later?  I'm thinking.  Like, to make up for the Earl thing, Ronnie might have to throw himself into the blockbuster trade. 
[02:19:30]  Ronnie?  We'll take Ronnie?  Well, we'll think about it.  Earl is such a detriment at this point in this whole blockbuster trade.  We're giving up Than and Sam.  They're giving us Earl so far.  I'm thinking he's got to throw himself in there.  So we'll have, for the Ron and Fez show, without Ron, it'll just be a red-headed lunatic, an emotional mess.  And Than and Sam.  And an incompetent producer.  Yeah.  And Than and Sam.  Well, no, the incompetent producer is coming along with Ron. 
[02:20:00]  Who?  Earl is the incompetent.  Oh, we'd have to take him.  Oh, that's right.  We have no choice.  Ronnie said that he won't even acknowledge a blockbuster trade if Earl's not thrown in there.  So then I, in turn, say that Ronnie has to give himself up, too, in the blockbuster trade.  We take Ron.  We take Ron.  Ron, everyone's up for grabs.  We take Ron.  We take Earl.  Mm-hmm.  We give them Than and Sam.  And a player to be named later.  What about?  Possibly Hip Hop Ron. 
[02:20:30]  Oh, God.  How about this?  We give them whoever they want for Lily.  Ah.  That's it.  You just want Lily.  You just want Lily?  On the show.  Just to walk around and look nice and smell good.  Yeah, and she's, I think she's good on the air, you know?  Yeah.  I say that.  Okay.  I mean, I love, I love Than and Sam, but I say those two, along with Steve.  Yeah, Steve's got to go.  His company.  Yeah.  On DFL Media.  We will. 
[02:21:00]  Let's trade Steve's foundry music.  And Will Chapman, our salesperson.  Let's trade Steve's sexuality.  What can we get for Steve's sexuality on The Rock and Fetish Show?  Something to hang clothes in.  What can we get for Steve's sexuality?  A horrible disease.  Hepatitis A.  Fucking.  A sore asshole.  All right, a blockbuster trade.  We want Lily.  We want Ronnie.  And we want Fez. 
[02:21:30]  You'll have the whole show.  It leaves them, it doesn't leave a Ron and Fez show.  That's all right.  We'll give them Than and Sam, Hip Hop Ron, and Steve's sexuality.  Than and Sam would probably like that, because then it would just be the Than and Sam show  on in place of the Ron and Fez show.  Right.  Well, you know, sometimes when a blockbuster trade goes down, you don't even recognize the  team anymore.  No, that's true.  You know, they're still called like the Knicks or what have you, but the players are all different. 
[02:22:00]  So they'd still have to be called Ron and Fez, but it would be Than and Sam?  Yeah, they would just have to recast the Ron part and the Fez part.  Menudo.  Menudo.  Yeah, they're like Menudo.  All right.  Hey, going with the theme, a look at the future.  Yes.  That was from 1958, right?  Yes.  Now we look at the future in this day and age, 2008.  We got a guy that's doing a Stan Meyer thing.  Uh-oh.  He's doing a Stan Meyer thing, Anthony. 
[02:22:30]  And we all know what happened to Stan Meyer.  No, we don't really.  I love the fact that people are arguing on message boards and stuff about Stan Meyer.  I would like to think that Stan Meyer was poisoned by the government.  By the government, yeah.  I don't really care what they're saying and that it's all bullshit and stuff.  I'd like to think that there was a Stan Meyer.  There was a Stan Meyer, right?  Yeah, and that he was poisoned by the government because he came up with a car that ran on water.  Yeah.  Whoa. 
[02:23:00]  What was that?  A phone.  That's Vince Vaughn, right?  Yeah.  Why?  He's giant.  Vince Vaughn?  He looks ridiculous.  He's on Regis.  Yeah.  And he stood up next to Regis.  Yeah.  And he looked like a giant.  Well, Vince Vaughn is part of the Big Head Club.  How tall are you?  We have a giant.  But look at his head compared to Regis's.  Yeah.  Look at how big his head is compared to Regis's.  I look like a little leprechaun next to you. 
[02:23:30]  That is just a giant head and hands and everything.  He is awkwardly big.  It's not even like...  He doesn't come across that big in movies.  Right.  You're right.  That movie Magic is...  He stands in the Grand Canyon.  Yeah.  They just put him in the Grand Canyon.  But what you don't understand is I've walked past Regis, who's a miserable fuck when he's  on the streets of New York.  Of course.  Wouldn't you be?  On TV, he looks like a happy-go-lucky guy, but in real life, he's not a happy man.  I gotta deal with this woman next to me that doesn't know anything and a homosexual producer! 
[02:24:00]  Oh, well, you understand that.  Regis is tiny in person.  Is he?  Tiny.  A little guy.  And Vince Vaughn is listed at 6'5".  I'd put him at 6'7".  I don't think Regis is even 5'6".  No.  I really don't.  I'm a wee little man of a man.  He's a little, little thing.  Tiny.  Little thing.  With a cock to match! 
[02:24:30]  Tiny.  Joy hates my little dick!  She calls it Lil Regis!  It's awful.  Lil.  Lil Regis.  Can we start the big head club?  Ooh, I don't want to be a member.  No, no, no, no.  We gotta get a club.  Maybe Stephen S. from Bayshore could write this as part of the rundown, even though it's  happening on this side of the show.  Just Stephen S., I know you're still listening.  We want to start the big head club.  We want to put Vince Vaughn on there.  We want to put Robert Plant on there. 
[02:25:00]  People are checking out my Robert Plant.  Yeah, Robert Plant's head is giant.  My Robert Plant picture, because I'm finally displaying some of my crap in my apartment,  they cannot believe how big his fucking head is.  He's the cowardly lion.  And I had to tell people, no, it's not that I was standing way behind the guy.  I wasn't.  I was pretty much even with Robert Plant.  It wasn't forced perspective.  It was actually just you guys, the exact distance from the camera.  His head is giant.  Yeah.  Anybody else you want to add to the big head club, Jimmy? 
[02:25:30]  Everyone with Down syndrome.  Aha.  Yes.  And the shoot-off Big Tongue Club.  That's right.  An ill-earned medals group.  Photo-ruiners of America.  David from Kansas City writes,  And of course.  That's right.  It's one more offshoot group, I think.  Yes.  I'm not only the Pete Rose wig president, but I'm also a client and a burden. 
[02:26:00]  Turn that hair over.  Eat potato salad out of this little bowl head.  It really is.  Like a little black bowl filled with stupidity.  Oh yeah, waitress, can I have a bowl of dumbness?  Coming right up, sir.  All right, listen.  People are going with the big head club.  We got Ted Kennedy. 
[02:26:30]  He makes the big head club.  Jerry Lewis makes the big head club.  Yep.  You got John Edwards, thanks to little Jimmy Norton.  I didn't notice that.  There.  There's the fucking Robert Plant picture.  Oh my God.  I gotta stress.  Like, it looks like I'm way down the hall.  When I got this picture taken with Robert Plant, thanks to Jim Norton, you can see the  stupid smile on my face.  And it looks like a fisheye lens.  This was a biggie for me, by the way.  I was a huge Zeppelin fan growing up.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  What's wrong, Jimmy?  I'll tell you after this. 
[02:27:00]  Okay.  Jimmy got the picture, because I was too shy to get it done, and the smirk says it all  on my face.  Very happy.  But I'm not way down the hall.  I'm just behind him.  It looks like you were following him at eight blocks, and someone got that.  In some kind of telephoto lens.  Look how much happier he is with me.  Can you click on mine?  Look at that.  There's a boy.  Yeah.  But again.  Oh my God.  Your picture of Robert Plant really shows how big his head is, because it's so obvious  you guys are like cheek to cheek.  You were a lot chubbier back then, Jimmy. 
[02:27:30]  I was a fat cunt.  Look at my fucking neck.  It's awful.  I look like fucking Vader without the helmet.  A young Donald Pleasance poses.  What a fucking blubber-necked bag of jizz.  And you don't even come close to the size of Robert Plant's head.  Let's start the big head club.  Robert Plant is definitely the president at this point, but Ted Kennedy's up there thanks  to Jimmy, John Edwards.  I didn't even notice John Edwards had a big head until you did that bit at Westbury  and got a huge laugh. 
[02:28:00]  Huge laugh.  Who else we got on there?  Ron Perlman?  We're going with Ron Perlman.  Okay.  Anthony Cumius-Cock.  Very good.  Big head club.  Well.  Conan O'Brien.  Conan O'Brien?  Oh, yes.  Yeah?  Well, he's a big dude.  Conan's six foot something.  And he does have a giant head.  Oh, Leno.  Leno, big head club.  Oh, boy, is he a big head.  That was a long head.  Barry Bonds, big head club.  Yes.  Who else are we going to do?  Vince Vaughn, of course.  Vince Vaughn.  Did you get Rosie?  Rosie O'Donnell, big head club.  Thank you. 
[02:28:30]  And Tito Ortiz has a gigantic melon that's coming in.  That's right.  It's his lunch.  Sarah Jessica Parker's coming in a lot.  She's got that, you know, we talked about that whole horse face.  Horsey thing going on.  Whoa.  Well, so.  And that's about it for now.  That's a good start.  Good start.  Okay.  So we look at the future.  This guy did a Stan Meyer and he invented a car that could get the government paying attention.  You got your little attention thing. 
[02:29:00]  Can I ask you a quick question before we start this?  Oh, no.  Just as guys.  Oh, no.  If I do this signal, do you guys know what this means?  If I look at you as an intern and I go, what does that mean?  I would say I want to enter a swimming competition in the Olympics.  I'm taking my two fingers, my point from my middle, and I'm chopping them like Pac-Man.  Right.  Like if I looked at you and I said.  Yeah.  Actually, I would say I need some scissors. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah.  That is the universal finger symbol for please bring me some scissors.  I really thought you were asking for young intern cock.  Oh, no.  I really did.  That would be I point to my mouth and I give a thumbs up.  Thank you.  But it wasn't me that asked for him.  I was imitating Jimmy.  How did you not know what this meant?  Will you get on the mic?  You didn't know what this meant?  No, I did not.  I didn't know. 
[02:30:00]  I didn't know.  Do you think I was a Vulcan?  What could that mean?  Live long and prosper.  These guys are insane.  Adam came in really fast to give Jimmy scissors.  And as Adam takes a mic, Danny runs around the room and hands out intern Adam fun facts.  Fun facts.  This is cool.  This would go on the back of his baseball card.  Don't read over my shoulder, please.  Thank you, Adam.  Sorry.  Oh, man.  Intern Adam fun facts.  Yes.  And here's one.  Yesterday, he spoke to the girl he had a crush on, Jessica, and admitted he's been in love 
[02:30:30]  with her for two years.  That's an Adam fun fact.  Why couldn't we do this on the air?  Adam, you don't know how to do radio, man.  Why wouldn't you talk to her on the air?  If you're going to talk to this girl and profess your love.  When did you talk to her?  What?  Is she on the air?  He apologized for being...  I have no idea.  Say that again.  Can I see your phone for a second?  He apologized for being an asshole.  We're getting Jessica on the phone? 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  All right.  Sorry, Anthony.  What?  He apologized for being an asshole.  Okay.  Fun fact.  After she told him she was upset with his behavior, he called her a bitch cunt.  Point at him.  This was during the phone call yesterday?  Point at him.  Yeah.  He says she's moving to Colorado with her boyfriend soon, and this could be the last conversation  they have.  It's dramatic stuff.  Adam has admitted to some of his fellow interns that he is on probation for shoplifting, and 
[02:31:30]  that he is a kleptomaniac.  No!  Wow.  What is that you just did?  Wow.  Don't do it again.  Have you shoplifted?  I have.  You have?  Yes.  And are you a kleptomaniac?  Sort of.  Did you take the cherries out of the refrigerator?  No.  No.  Absolutely not.  There's still a mystery.  What I did, I went to Target, and I pocketed some hand.  You should have bought one for your head. 
[02:32:00]  That's right.  The Target was boredom.  Bullseye.  Man, oh man.  Yes, so you went to Target, and what happened?  And I shoplifted a box of Teddy Grahams, hand sanitizer, and Vaseline, and got busted.  All right.  Okay.  Why those products?  I can understand the Teddy Grahams.  You were probably hungry.  I was.  The hand sanitizer is an iffy thing, but if you were, if you just wanted to clean your 
[02:32:30]  hands, perhaps, that I can understand.  Yeah.  Vaseline is only one reason to have a shoplifted Vaseline, and that is because you wanted to  go and masturbate.  No.  And use the worst lubricant possible for masturbating.  No.  No.  Did you want to eat the Teddy Grahams and then jerk off to how tasty they were, and then clean  up?  No.  Clean up?  Yeah.  Why Vaseline?  No, I just needed some. 
[02:33:00]  For what?  For what?  Well, because there's that region in between the penis and the leg where I rub it on so  I don't, like, irritate any skin.  Are you out of your fucking mind?  You put Vaseline between, like, your nutsack and your thigh?  Yes.  For what?  Were you shaking playing baseball?  Dude, that would fucking occupy my mind the entire day.  I'd walk around like I got fucked in the ass. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, squishy, squishy.  You'd have to be like, how do you not, how is that not the most uncomfortable feeling to  walk around with?  It's like you shit your diaper or something.  No, it's fine.  No, it's not.  No, I used to, I don't know, it's just, it's kind of like my morning ritual.  You do it every, you have Vaseline right now between your ball sack and your thigh.  Yeah, after I take a shower, I got my cupboard, I just.  Cupboard?  Pick it up and I do the little.  Fucking Charles Ingalls.  Go to the cupboard, half pint. 
[02:34:00]  The cupboard.  I think he still.  I think he's still.  I think he's.  I think he's.  I think he's.  I think he's.  I think he's.  I think he still thinks he's going to make the major leagues.  Who?  You.  Me?  No, exactly.  Seems like you're obsessed with baseball stuff.  That'll look a little odd, him dipping his hand down his pants and then spitballing  it with the avasaline from his ball bag.  We got Jessica on the line.  Now, who is this Jessica girl again?  She's a, she's a coworker.  I've worked with her for like four years.  At Target? 
[02:34:30]  No, no.  And we work at a hospital together.  Oh, boy.  Please tell me you're a male nurse.  I, I, I do do, uh, nurse's aid stuff.  Holy shit.  How many people have you put out of their misery?  Holy shit.  It's all starting to make sense.  How many people have you just put out of their misery?  They're suffering.  It's okay.  I just wipe ass and, you know, do the nurse's aid thing.  Oh, my God.  He's a male.  You're a candy striper.  I'm not.  You're a fucking candy striper.  And I do secretarial work, uh, on the side for, uh, another department in the hospital. 
[02:35:00]  And I also, uh, transport patients in another department.  So I, I do basically.  Wow.  A lot of different things.  And Jessica, I've, I've worked with for, uh, quite some time.  Please, to the best of your ability, describe Jessica.  Uh, well, she's, she's short, uh, kind of, kind of, uh, like about 5'1".  5'1".  Uh, brown hair, green eyes, um, very, very good looking.  I, I would give her a 10. 
[02:35:30]  Um.  And you've been working with her for a long time and you've had a crush, a major crush  on her.  But you're basically in love with her, right?  For the last two years?  Yeah.  And yesterday you actually told her on the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because she, well, here's the deal is that I, when I was in New York, we, we've been  talking on and off and I left a series of voicemail messages.  Like on a week by week basis, just, Hey, what's up?  Oh, I'd love to hear those.  What's up?  Call me back.  Fuck.  You know, I, I hope you're doing well.  And she's, she never called back. 
[02:36:00]  But then all of a sudden when I was on the air, uh, yesterday, she, uh, my phone rang instantly  and it was her.  So you're saying that she might've been attracted to the fact that you were getting some airtime?  I have no idea, but it was just kind of weird.  Do you think it's possible?  Did you ask her, I'm your density?  No, I didn't do a George McFly thing.  I'm your density.  Why did you call her a bitch cunt yesterday?  Yeah.  That doesn't seem like a, well, I got there.  I don't get angry too much, but I was getting a little, I was getting a little angry because 
[02:36:30]  she said I was being mean and, and I was like, and I said, what am I being mean about?  And she, and she didn't really know what to say.  And so I'm like, listen, way to counteract that, by the way.  Yeah.  No kidding.  Way to diffuse the situation.  Yeah.  And I, she wouldn't explain how I was being mean.  And I, and I said, uh, you know what?  You're acting like a, you're acting like a bitch cunt.  That's, but, but then I profusely apologized after that because I don't like to, uh, but 
[02:37:00]  it's too late.  That's multiple choice.  Why don't we say hi to Jessica?  Jessica.  Yeah.  Hi.  Hi.  You're on the Opie and Anthony show.  Do you know anything about us?  I don't, but I have a list of things that I'm supposed to say.  A list of things you're supposed to say?  No.  Yeah.  I'm supposed to say, Hey, Opie, what's up brother, man?  Mother Hucker.  Who?  And Ron and Fez knew until three. 
[02:37:30]  What are, what are, Jesse, don't, what are you doing?  Ryan gave me a list.  Who?  Ryan.  Who's that?  No, it's, it's one of, one of my buddies who's like a super fan and, and he, he probably  fed her some lines to say, but she's, she's, you know, I, you know, stop, just stop.  You consider yourself a 10?  No.  Adam does.  I heard that.  She will be next year. 
[02:38:00]  How old a gal are you?  I'm 22.  22.  Um, how much do you weigh?  About a hundred.  Cool.  A hundred.  Okay.  You're five, one.  Five, one and three fourths.  Yeah.  You can, you could probably lose three pounds.  So you're, you're a petite girl.  I am.  That's good.  So, uh, what do you know about this Adam guy?  I know a lot about him.  Yeah.  How about you elaborate on that a little bit? 
[02:38:30]  She doesn't elaborate at all.  She's a one word.  She just says one word.  She just says one word.  And it, and it fucking pisses the shit out of me.  Adam, I think you were buying the Teddy Grahams to try out your Cheez-It thing.  What's this Cheez-It thing, Jess?  No.  Are you going to tell him, Adam?  No.  Do I, I, you know what, Jesse?  I don't give a shit.  I don't care what you say.  Wow.  He is really violent toward you. 
[02:39:00]  I don't care.  He's got, um.  Tell him, Adam.  What's the Cheez-It thing?  Yeah, what is the Cheez-It thing?  No.  Does it involve your asshole?  No, I, I just like to, uh.  Thanks, Kate.  You know, put, put Cheez-Its on my erection and use them as a catapult and catch them in  my mouth.  All right, listen, dude.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  You're so full of shit.  I know.  Of course you are.  Jessica.  Yeah.  Jessica, has he told you this?  He told me this.  He's kidding.  He's trying to be shocking.  No. 
[02:39:30]  Um, what do you know about him that you've experienced?  That, well, I know he can do some stripper dances.  Oh.  You've seen them?  I have.  So you guys work in the hospital together?  Are you guys in cahoots together?  Of course you are.  No.  Are you trying to get air time?  No.  What is this about?  No.  No.  I, she's, she's, she's.  She's just a terror.  She doesn't know how to emote.  She's a one word gal. 
[02:40:00]  I, I, you know, try to get something out of her, but she doesn't really say what she,  what she, uh, feels or, you know, she doesn't.  Who came up with the Cheez-Its gag where you said you, you, you, you, that's made up.  Of course it is.  That's made up.  No, it's not.  How do you know?  He told me.  Exactly.  When?  When he told me the remote story.  I think that's a...  I mean, when was that?  The remote story where he measured his dick. 
[02:40:30]  When is that?  It's a remote.  When did he tell you?  Yeah, but when did he tell you this?  How long ago?  Hmm.  Um, like last year at work.  Hmm.  So, now, do you like this girl?  I, I do, but, um, it's, it's complicated because I'm, I'm, I'm very awkward and, uh, she,  she has a boyfriend who she's, uh, constantly on and off with and so I, I don't really know,  I don't really know how to, how to make my, make my move. 
[02:41:00]  I don't, I don't have any moves really.  You know who he reminds me of?  Adam Sandler.  A little bit.  You actually do, I'm selling him.  So, Jess, wait, Chester's Liver's saying that that's a Dane Cook bit, but he uses a different  food product instead of Cheez-Its.  What does he use?  Like, fucking peanuts or something?  I don't remember, I just, I just remember that was a Dane Cook.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, it's cashews, Eric Cashews.  Cashews.  Yes!  That's fine in the audio.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Come on, dude.  That's a Dane Cook bit.  Yeah, but I, I juxtaposed it with Cheez-Its one day. 
[02:41:30]  You, you, you, he is weird.  But, but I, I, I'm starting to think it's, it's a big put-on.  Yeah.  No, no.  You went over the top with the Cheez-Its.  Yeah.  What's he like at work, for real?  What's Adam like at work?  Yes.  He is awkward, like he said.  Okay.  He's funny.  Okay.  He's really funny.  But toward the end, he got cocky.  How cocky?  How?  Rude and cocky. 
[02:42:00]  Um, did you know that he...  And that is why I didn't call him back.  Did you know that he liked you?  Um, I did.  Because one night he got really drunk and told me.  How'd he say it?  He just came right out with it.  And said that, uh, what, he loves you?  Yep, he's had a crush on me for two years.  Uh, yes. 
[02:42:30]  Sam.  Did you say he got really drunk and told her?  Yeah.  Adam has proclaimed, uh, off the air that he has never tried alcohol.  Well, no, I, you know...  Is your web of lies coming from here?  Yeah, ha, ha, ha, ha, Sam.  No, it's...  Yeah, it's all coming apart.  It's crumbling.  I think we got him on the ropes here.  No, we got...  No, if there's a party, you know, and people are offering, and people are drinking...  You said you had never, ever tried alcohol.  We got another eye patch situation here.  Yeah.  Linger longer. 
[02:43:00]  So now, explain this.  How did you say you've never had a drink?  Well, I just said I don't drink.  And, uh...  No, you said...  No, no, from what Sam's saying, he's saying you elaborated to the point where you really  made a point of saying that you don't...  You've never drank.  I don't like to, because, uh...  That's not what you said.  Mars is a witness.  Mars is in here.  And he said to both of us...  Mars?  That you...  No, no, no.  Adam said...  No, no, I'm just kidding, Mars.  Yeah, Adam, you said you don't drink at all. 
[02:43:30]  No.  Yes, you did.  I said you never have.  No, I don't.  There was a period where I just gave it up, and I just don't do it anymore.  Because it brings out stupid things.  Not what he said yesterday.  What did he say, Mars?  He said he doesn't drink, and he has never tried it.  Oh, he did say he's never tried it.  I didn't say that.  Something to that effect, right?  Oh, we got another witness?  Tony?  I asked him if he wanted a spitter.  Just joking around.  What's a spitter?  A skull.  And he told me he's never done nicotine or alcohol in his life before. 
[02:44:00]  That was the second day he was here.  Now, why would you say that?  Well, I don't do tobacco.  I don't smoke.  But I drink occasionally.  Wait, Tony, don't go anywhere.  And it brings out the worst in me.  And I don't do it.  I do it very rarely.  Tony.  Tony's very opinionated and the true star of the Than and Sam show.  Tony.  What do you think about this kid? 
[02:44:30]  Well, we went out for interviews on the street Tuesday, I believe, and he seemed pretty normal  to me.  I mean, there was no kind of shenanigans going on.  He was just, you know, getting people, and it was like any other intern.  And then when he comes in here, it's crazy.  It's all like, oh, well, I, uh.  No, I was just trying to help you guys out and get people.  No, you did a good job.  This is a wacky character.  He's a wacky character guy. 
[02:45:00]  Is this a wacky character?  That he won't break.  Yeah, I think as soon as you guys come in here, it kind of flips.  He was fine this morning, you know.  And then you guys come in here, and he's screaming baseball players' names with big heads while  the doors open.  I think you're a wacky character guy.  Jess, is he's touching different now than you know him at work?  Is he a little more stilted now?  Um, he seems a little shyer.  Are you part of the bit, Jess? 
[02:45:30]  You can tell us.  Are you part of the bit?  No.  How did he prep you?  Just tell us that.  Yeah.  See if it's consistent.  Because he, we were told that he prepped you.  I want to see if it's the same way.  Oh, no.  Um, I talked to him yesterday, and he told me I could say whatever I wanted.  Okay.  He called you a bitch cunt?  A stupid bitch cunt.  And when he was trying to, like, tell you how he's perceived on the show, what did he  say? 
[02:46:00]  He didn't really say too much about that.  He just said he was the internet.  He didn't say that he's kind of weird and...  No, she already knows I'm fucked up.  Don't try to, don't try to interfere with my fucking ruse, my clever ruse.  Yeah.  My questioning, my line of questioning.  I think it's a bit.  No, he didn't.  Yeah, what's, what's the bit there, uh...  What is the bit?  What's the end game with this one?  There's no, there's no bit. 
[02:46:30]  Uh, there, there's no bit at all.  I, you know, I, I just, uh...  You know, I, I had all my, all my ducks in a row.  I, I, you know, I, I would like to say that, that Jesse has been, like, probably the only  girl that I've, like, uh, ever associated with on a normal basis.  The only girl who's gotten me.  Um, and I didn't really know where to take that.  And, uh, you know, I, I, I had, like, a couple opportunities here and there. 
[02:47:00]  I, I, I missed them immensely.  Oh, my God, listen, I, I'm bored with this guy.  I, first of all, the remote story is also BS.  That's, like, from Rescue Me, Dennis Leary.  Thanks for reminding me of that one.  Dennis Leary talks about that in Rescue Me.  The other thing, the, it's so obvious you're lying at him because you won't look at anybody.  I mean, who do you think you're dealing with?  Yeah, yeah, you just kind of...  I'm not...  You think we're fucking rookies?  No, I...  I, I know body language.  I've, I've been studying body language since I was 18 years old.  No, I...  You're looking down at the console, because, you know, if you look in someone's eyes, you're 
[02:47:30]  going to be had.  No, I...  So tell us what's going on.  There's nothing...  Do you want airtime?  No.  If you want airtime, we can figure something out.  There's no, there's no airtime.  It's just, uh...  No, there is airtime.  There is.  But, uh...  I, I just...  There's no airtime.  There is.  I, I think what's happened is there's a bit of truth that's just been, let's say, exaggerated.  Right.  I think this is a magnification.  And that's where the character part of it comes in.  I don't think that he's completely unawkward.  Or shy.  I think that's probably part of who he is.  But I think it's exaggerated here to be interesting. 
[02:48:00]  No, I think this is some kind of fucking groundlings performance I'm saying here.  This is like, he's, he's doing a performance piece.  No, I, no, I...  See, look Anthony in the eye and tell him it's not true.  No, it's not true.  He's a liar.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Jess, are you in on this?  No, I don't think he's lying.  You've worked together and he's been like this, exactly like this. 
[02:48:30]  He's never normal.  He's always a fucking weirdo.  Come on, Jess.  He's sometimes normal.  He can have a conversation if he needs to.  Yeah.  What?  I can't hear.  But he's awkward at times.  You can't hear what she's saying?  Yeah.  Because we have that, that microphone is blocked so you can't hear what she's saying.  Coach her.  Oh, man.  Hmm.  What the fuck is going on? 
[02:49:00]  I don't know.  He won't fess up.  Why did Tony leave?  Yeah, I love it.  Tony.  Why did Tony turn into fucking Samuel the Shy Sea Lion?  I don't know.  He's...  Mars?  No, it's okay, Mars.  He doesn't need to hear it.  No, I know.  You sure?  Hmm.  I was right.  There you go.  We blocked it on purpose.  We'll tell him what she's saying.  Um...  It's just something doesn't smell right here. 
[02:49:30]  And we know that.  Something is not right.  Yeah.  What's going on?  I don't know what's going on.  I just, uh...  What was she saying?  How do you feel about him, Jess?  He's a nice kid.  I like him as a friend.  Are you attracted to him?  I don't know.  I never thought about it.  Sometimes, when he's not cocky and mean. 
[02:50:00]  And mean?  Cocky and mean?  Cocky and mean and calling me nasty names.  What are you talking about?  He sounds like he's acting.  No.  No.  I...  No.  You know, I was just cocky and mean because I would, you know, my life's, uh, for the  past fucking three years, my life has been shit.  And, uh, the past year, you know, things have been working out for me.  And I was joking around, laughing, having a good time. 
[02:50:30]  And, you know...  And nobody else was.  I don't know how you feel about that.  But it's, you know...  I come into...  When I...  You know, I'm just happy.  You know?  And I'm just trying to be a different guy.  Because, uh...  I don't like the different guy.  You know, things are working out.  And I don't know if you...  Paula, she says...  You don't like what, sweetheart?  I don't like the different guy.  The new guy.  You don't like the new guy.  He's cocky.  The new guy.  Well, you know what?  Uh, I don't know.  I don't know what your deal is.  Um, you're going... 
[02:51:00]  You're going to Colorado.  Um, I'm probably never gonna fucking talk to you again.  You know?  All right, wait.  Another lie.  Don't you guys work together still?  No, she's...  She's taking a month off to go to Colorado.  Um...  Jess, are you working today?  Actually, I have a day off today.  Ah.  And when are you working again?  Tomorrow.  And, Adam, when are you working again?  Uh, sometime in, like, uh...  Early March.  What?  I'm taking a week off. 
[02:51:30]  I gotta tie up some loose ends, uh...  In Michigan.  And so I'm gonna pick up a couple days.  What's that?  To put lie on the hole?  A week off.  It's February 7th.  Yeah, what?  In early March.  So when...  So you're going to see her again.  This doesn't make any sense.  No, I'm not gonna go see her.  She's suck at trying to get something going.  No, no.  She's going to, uh...  She's gonna take a leave of absence.  It's the Colorado.  You said you're never gonna see her again.  No, because she's probably gonna move there. 
[02:52:00]  And you know what?  But she's working tomorrow.  Yeah.  And you're not taking off until fucking March.  It's February 7th.  Yeah.  Oh, by the way, yeah.  Thank you, Danny.  Let's play this clip real fast.  I get this erection.  I look over.  There's a can of cashews on my left.  You're right.  I open it up.  I take a cashew.  Put it on the tip of my hog.  I bent it back.  Shot it into my mouth.  First try.  See, that would be your cheesy bit.  Yeah. 
[02:52:30]  Your life is based on, like, bits from other comedians.  You know, you had me there.  But, you know, I'd like to close this chapter on my life.  Because I, you know, I...  Can you close it as mud bones?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, I don't know.  I don't know, Jessica.  You know, she's really just not a...  I just don't like her as a person.  She treats people like shit.  She's treated me like shit for two years. 
[02:53:00]  She's walked all over me.  And it keeps going back to this.  Even though we're not even addressing the you and Jessica thing.  No, there is no thing.  No, we're addressing the fact that we think you're bullshitting with your whole act here.  No.  No.  I, you know, I'm just, I'm trying to, I'm trying to get, to get into, trying to do new things.  And I'm trying to, trying to put myself out there and do a lot of different things that I've never done. 
[02:53:30]  Just be you.  Go ahead.  No, no.  Break, break, break this character and go ahead.  Just be, be the guy you always are.  Be the guy you are when you, you're not on the show.  Go ahead.  How does, I don't even know how to...  It's, it's not this character that you're doing.  I, no.  You're doing like a character.  No, I, I don't...  We know you're doing a character.  This is a character.  You're faking right now.  I'm not...  This whole, I, it's, it's, it's fake.  You can talk normal.  You can act normal.  You're not a weird guy.  You just do this so you can get air time and do like a bit. 
[02:54:00]  And, and pull one over on everybody.  And it's, it's, it worked.  You had us for a little while.  But now, just be you.  Go ahead.  Snap right out of it.  Go ahead.  Well, I, I don't really know how to be me.  Talk about sports.  Something you, you know real well.  Like, like baseball.  You know baseball real well.  You're not attentive and hesitant when you talk about baseball.  Yeah, that's...  Well, I, I like baseball.  I like old time baseball from like the 19, the 1900s.  And I, I like to, I, I, I like to read about it and everything. 
[02:54:30]  All right, listen.  I'm, it's, it's...  I'm bored with you.  Listen to me.  It's such an act.  I...  Can we get a lie detector test in here?  Oh.  We really should.  It's a, it's kind of a hack bit.  It's been done a lot.  But can we get a lie detector test?  Jess, what's he lying about?  How do we get that done?  What?  What's he lying about?  Do you have a MySpace?  I got a Facebook.  No, I don't.  Not you.  You got what?  I have a Facebook.  Facebook?  Can we punch it up? 
[02:55:00]  Yeah, fine.  All right.  Hold on.  Okay.  Give, uh, give Danny the, uh, go over there.  Okay.  Give Danny the Addy.  And, um, so everybody doesn't jump on it and freeze it up.  Because I want to see what's on there.  Maybe there's a clue.  He creeps me out.  It's, it's creepy on one hand.  But on the second hand, I, I think it's such an act that he's, he's an actor.  I think he's an actor-comedian.  And he's doing this character that is based on things that he saw. 
[02:55:30]  Like the, Dane and, and Rescue Me and stuff.  And, uh, he's probably a regular guy.  A regular guy.  He's nuts.  No, I don't think he is.  Yeah.  He's fucking nuts.  You don't think this is a bit?  I think he's fucking nuts.  I think it's a bit.  Multiple personalities.  No.  Okay.  Is that right?  What do we got?  It's the computer's frozen. 
[02:56:00]  Ah, son of a bitch.  Frozen computer shit.  Why don't we, uh, should we take a break?  Let's take a break.  See if we can find that thing.  And then, uh, yeah, I, I just, I don't think he's crazy.  I think it's a bit.  All right.  Um, okay, Tony gave me something.  Adam.  Yes.  I want you to write down.  Yes.  Where you were when you told Jess you loved her.  Where I was when I told Jess that I loved her. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah, write it down right now.  Here's a Sharpie and paper.  He's writing.  La-de-dee.  Jeez.  What were you doing for the first time?  It's a location, for fuck's sake.  It should take two seconds.  He just crossed out his first answer.  Why, Sam?  Because he was writing where he was when he called her yesterday.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  All right. 
[02:57:00]  You're supposed to write down where you were when you told Jess you loved her.  And also where Jess was, part two of the question.  Shouldn't take this long, should it?  Okay.  I'm, I'm, uh, I'm just about complete.  You're, uh, who shall I give this to?  Give it to Anthony.  Okay.  I really don't want any contact with you.  Ahem.  I smell psychopaths. 
[02:57:30]  Psychopaths?  Yeah, you got multiple personalities.  You fucking scare me.  He says, a party in the summer.  And then, uh, where she was there as well.  Jess, is that true?  That's true.  We're sitting on the couch.  We were supposed to have Jess answer first.  Because if she's in on the bit, we just play into his hands.  Well, who, no one told me what the fuck was going on.  He gave me the paper and I read it. 
[02:58:00]  Because I don't trust her either.  I didn't know what the bit was.  The whole bit was to have her answer and then we read Adam's answer.  That would have been good.  We just fucked it up.  Oh, well.  Oh, that could have been it right there.  Because I don't, because she sounds suspicious too.  I had no idea what the fuck that was.  It would have been, you know, nice if someone told me.  I had no clue.  Can you redo it?  Tony?  I don't know.  I think maybe we do whose party.  Where was it at? 
[02:58:30]  I don't know.  I thought that was the way to go.  Oh, we fucked it up.  Tony had a good idea too.  All right.  How about where was the party?  That's a good thing.  Hold on.  Don't say anything.  How about he writes down his answer and then she says it?  Yeah, yeah.  Am I late to another one?  Just right on the back of my, no, those are my tour dates.  Right there.  Right where this party was.  There we go.  Yeah, you're right, Mikey.  From Philly.  He repeated the question.  That's a mental stall tactic to come up with a lie.  Very good, Mikey.  Very good. 
[02:59:00]  All right.  I have the location of the party, which I will not reveal.  By the way, Anthony.  Is that what you just did?  I was pissing.  That's hilarious.  Anthony Nakumia writes, ha ha, way to go, Colombo.  No one told me what we were doing.  It's like, let Anthony read it because I don't want any contact with him.  So I read it.  Oh, good.  Yeah, good point.  I led you down that road a little bit.  I didn't know where we were going there.  All right. 
[02:59:30]  Jess, what party?  A co-worker, Matt.  Says Matt's house.  Says Matt's house.  It's probably the hangout at his house all the time.  That's why.  Well, after the party was revealed, she could easily remember that a party that she possibly  was at with this fucking clown.  All right.  We're going to get a lie detector.  I guess Danny's saying it'll take a couple of days, but we can certainly get one.  Yeah.  All right.  Why are you worried about a lie detector?  No, I'm not worried about a lie detector. 
[03:00:00]  It's just that my personal life has been just destroyed.  How?  What part?  What?  Yeah, why?  You know, you guys say I'm gay.  I'm asexual.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Why didn't you say you were gay?  We're asking.  I'm not gay.  You know, I'm just.  That was an opinion, which is very different.  I just tried to.  I just tried to.  I don't really know.  I don't know what's going on.  Yeah.  I'll make it perfectly clear. 
[03:00:30]  I don't know if you're gay.  I don't know if you're asexual.  I don't know what the fuck you are.  The bottom line is you were saying you've never kissed a girl at age 22.  No.  So being gay was an option.  Of course, guys are going to think that or ask it.  Oh, I'm an asexual.  You said, all right, well, asexual.  Maybe you don't like to fuck at all.  You said no?  I don't know.  I just.  I got a question.  Why are we letting the interns wreck a wonderful radio show?  I don't know.  Between Hip Hop Ron and this clown.  Hip Hop Ron.  I'm sorry.  He stunk on ice.  Yeah.  Oh, did he?  All right.  We're going to get a lie detector test for you. 
[03:01:00]  All right.  What do you want to admit right now, man?  I mean, stop.  What do I want to admit?  Something is up here.  Are you on drugs?  No, I just.  Prescription pills?  Are you seeing like a psychiatrist?  A psychologist?  I'm on a prescription.  I'm on Zoloft.  I take Zoloft.  Maybe that would be the mood thing.  The other day he said no.  I'm on Zoloft.  I've been, you know, kind of my first couple years in college.  All right.  Things kind of hit the fan. 
[03:01:30]  You know, we asked you the other day if you were on any kind of medication.  You said no.  You said aspirin sometimes or something.  Yeah.  That's another lie.  Now it's Zoloft?  And I'm reading your face.  When you squish your face like that, that's usually another sign that you're lying about.  You know, I.  When you do that, this thing.  Well, I always.  When you squish your eyebrows together.  Are you a compulsive liar?  I'm not a compulsive liar.  I try to be very truthful.  Well.  With.  Well, you lied about the Zoloft.  Why did you lie about the medication?  And the drinking.  Well, because I was, I was very, I was very nervous yesterday because you guys, you guys 
[03:02:00]  are grilling me quite hard.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, you know, I.  I just happen to have Zoloft laying around when you're nervous.  And because we grilled you, you decide to pop a Zoloft.  Oh, I.  You know, I, I, I just, I went to a counselor for a couple of years and he helped get things  straightened out and, uh, everything's good.  When was the last time you've been to a, uh, counselor or, um, uh, doctor of psychiatry 
[03:02:30]  or psychology?  Uh, December.  This past December?  Yes.  And is that when you were prescribed the Zoloft?  No, I, I, I was prescribed the Zoloft, uh, two years, uh, prior.  But you said you don't do drugs or.  No, no, not, not drugs.  We have audio of you saying that.  Not drugs.  We also have audio.  We got to find it where you admit you, you've never drank before.  No, but drugs like, not like hard drugs or marijuana.  No, we asked you if you were on prescription drugs, like Zoloft or something like that. 
[03:03:00]  You said no.  The thing, the thing is yesterday, you guys took the wind out of my sails, um, pretty  You got Zoloft on you right now?  Uh, it's at my, it's in my, uh, nightstand.  As he dropped something nervously.  What'd you drop?  Uh, a pen.  You can grab it if you need it.  Uh, Steve, why, just say it.  Um, it's, it has nothing to do with that.  Do you actually interview these guys?  Oh yeah, totally.  This, this, this never surfaced. 
[03:03:30]  Believe me, this is all shocking.  That is shocking.  Someone is suggesting that you dress up like your mom and sit in a rocking chair.  What are you writing down?  Uh, remember gunshot guy from Philly?  Yeah.  He's right there.  So?  That's what I was, that's what I was going to write down.  Exactly.  That's what you raced in with?  Jesus.  Race.  Hardly raced it.  He came in.  How much more can we talk about?  The Dodgers have moved to Los Angeles.  How much more can we talk about his gunshot?  Did he get shot again?  I'll go find out.  Please do.  All right, thanks. 
[03:04:00]  Come back.  Fucking place him falling apart.  And that's how you throw a monkey wrench into a show.  Hey, I'll have you know he asked.  And, and why are you saying take the wind out of my sails?  That's like lying shit.  No, I, I, you guys, you guys were growing me pretty hard yesterday and I, I didn't know how to react to it.  Um, and, yeah.  Why were you stealing from Target?  Well, because I, I don't know.  I, I just felt like doing it.  Um, I wasn't really thinking.  Are we safe with this guy around here? 
[03:04:30]  You're a klepto, obviously.  I'm out of this pit.  This guy's going to fucking do something stupid.  No, I'm, I'm, I'm quite normal.  Yeah.  You're a klepto.  I just don't know how to fit in with the, with this crew currently.  Um.  Yeah, I'll say.  We were, when, during the walkover, by the way.  Uh.  You know I said hi to you as I was entering the building, right?  No.  And you just, were just staring off into the distance?  I walked right by you.  I figured, alright, the guy had a, had a tough the last couple days.  I'll just acknowledge that he exists. 
[03:05:00]  I say hi and he's just sitting there like this.  Be kind of cordial.  No, I, I nodded my head.  No, you didn't.  Are you dead?  What, what, Danny?  Well, I, when I was coming into the building, Adam was just kind of hanging, uh, right by  the, uh, the entryway.  So I just pulled the old, uh, you know, working hard, I'm hardly working.  And, uh, he didn't know how to react to that, so he decided the best way would be to shove  me.  And we all just kind of stood around and said, what, what was that?  Like, why did you do that?  He shoved you?  Yeah, we were all just kind of shocked.  Like, how, like, we didn't understand why that, that happened the way it did. 
[03:05:30]  And he still doesn't have a, a proper response for that.  And then he laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world.  You have a little violence streak in you, don't you?  No.  Is that why you're on Zoloft?  Well, Zoloft is, is, you know, to calm you down like that.  Uh, have you had, like, violence, uh, in your past, or there's never been any violence?  I, I, I got, I got angry one time and, uh, I, uh, I, I slapped my steering wheel like  12 times and, and broke my hand.  Um, and then there was another time where I just took my glasses and I threw them against 
[03:06:00]  the wall.  Sam's back.  Well, that's about it.  You, um, you ever, uh, have any problems with, um, any kind of violence against people?  Assault?  No, no.  Battery?  Nothing like that?  Nothing like that.  Not even just an arrest without any, um, charges being done?  Kenny can look it up.  Oh, yeah.  And, and by the way, when do you work next?  Tomorrow?  Monday.  All right, you're bringing in your Zoloft, you know that, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  And Sam, what do you got?  Did you ever shop with before, any other time than at Target? 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  Where?  Or, like, all over.  Oh.  Like, what else have you stolen?  Um, like, DVDs and, uh, like, when the Sopranos, the final season came out, I would,  I would take those from various stores and then just sell them on eBay and get, like,  get, like, 60 bucks.  So, now, what makes me think our shit is safe around here?  No, no.  If he steals it, it goes on eBay.  No, no.  It's, it's, it's, it's not like that.  I, I've been, I've been, uh, to, uh, to probation. 
[03:07:00]  I've, I've talked.  I've talked to a woman and.  That helps.  A woman.  So have I.  Yeah.  It didn't help my anger or.  Yeah, you know, it, it's all, it's all getting straightened out.  Um, I, I, I admit to my guilt and it's, it's all being straightened out.  You're missing the point.  I'm not talking about the legal shit.  I'm talking about the idea of that you do that a lot.  You obviously have done it a lot.  You've stolen a lot of different shit.  So why would we feel comfortable with our stuff around you?  Oh my God.  No, and the lies keep coming in. 
[03:07:30]  Jimmy, good point.  Hold that thought for a second because I don't want this to go flying by without reading it.  He said yesterday, where the fuck is it?  God damn it.  You're really, this kid pisses me off.  He said yesterday, uh, that he only saw a high school counselor.  A high school counselor?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We got audio of it.  What?  You said that, uh.  Our listeners, they listen to every fucking word of the show.  We asked if you've been to a psychiatrist or been to therapy.  And you said, no, you saw a high school counselor.  I said, I said a counselor.  I said, I just said a counselor. 
[03:08:00]  Where's the audio from yesterday?  Yeah, now we need the audio from yesterday.  It was a counselor and it was relating to an event that happened when I was in high school.  Right, the death of your coach at a very young age from a car accident.  Yes, and I didn't say a high school counselor.  I said, I went to just a normal counselor and to talk about that incident.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  So I'm not.  Well.  You're not.  Um, you're going to be part of the blockbuster trade. 
[03:08:30]  That's right.  You for Lily.  You and Hip Hop Ron.  For Lily.  And Ron Bennington.  And Dave's balls.  I have a, uh, I have a text here from someone who will go nameless.  It says, give me his pedigree info.  I'll run his lying ass.  Okay.  K to C.  So we'll need, uh, no, no, no.  Oh, no, cool.  Someone else.  Good.  That's very good. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah, we'll get, we'll get your info.  We'll have him run you.  See what you got.  How old was your baseball coach when he died?  Um, either 25 or 26.  Well, yesterday you said 26.  I, I, even I know that.  And I could give a shit about your stupid baseball coach that died in a car accident.  Yeah.  But it was very obvious you said 26.  20, you know, I.  But it affected you so deeply that you had to go to counseling.  Right.  Yeah.  Compulsive liar.  That's what's coming in.  No. 
[03:09:30]  You really are kind of getting tripped up on a lot of this.  I'm not.  I'm just.  No, you are.  You're, you're, you're tripping up on some, uh, questions.  Just a few.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  Were you still at Target again?  Well, uh, Teddy Grahams, um, hand sanitizer, um, some Vaseline.  So what else would be stolen besides that and the Sopranos DVDs? 
[03:10:00]  Uh, you know, just, uh, papers, gum, um.  Come on, man.  I'm trying to think about what else.  Um, some DVDs of previous, of series of, like, HBO stuff from Best Buy.  Why so vague?  What?  Why so vague?  You should be able to just go, I, I, I stole this DVD, that DVD.  Well, because, uh, you know, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Arrested Development, um, Sopranos. 
[03:10:30]  You know, I.  And you've, uh, how much money have you made, uh, selling those?  You know, uh, about 500.  500 on eBay?  Yeah.  All right.  Look up his eBay name.  Give him, give, give, give him your name on eBay.  We found, uh, uh, audio from yesterday, Butcher?  Yesterday.  And we'll see if he's sold anything.  Yeah, this is Adam from yesterday.  Are you on drugs?  Was I?  Prescription right now.  I don't, um, I don't take any drugs. 
[03:11:00]  Don't drink, don't smoke.  Therapy?  Huh?  Don't drink, don't smoke.  You in therapy?  Um, no, I, I, I did a little bit of counseling, uh, back in the day.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Not December, back in the day.  What was this day?  Uh, like, a couple years ago.  Oh, a couple years ago.  And it was for, what?  Uh, for, for depression.  Dude, you were a little depressed.  Well, you know, things were, things were happening, and, uh, you know.  Things were happening.  Yeah.  What do you mean?  What was happening?  Like happening.  Well, you know, some, uh, some things in my life.  I, I, you know, uh, a couple people died, and, you know, I had to just, uh, 
[03:11:30]  You killed him?  No.  You're teasing, of course.  No.  No.  Family members?  Who died?  Older?  One, one, uh, uh, one of my coaches, uh, from, uh, baseball.  Hilarious.  Who else died besides your coach?  That was, uh, that was yesterday, where he said, no drugs, no drinking, no smoking.  Yeah.  Counselor a few years back.  Well, he did, the, I am looking up here, he does indeed have some Sopranos stuff for sale.  Um. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, everything, everything that he's sold is, uh, all DVD boxes.  DVD box sets.  Yeah, it, it's, it's, I, I don't really like to talk about this, because it, it happened,  like, six months ago, when I, when I finally got caught, and I, I, I really just feel uncomfortable  talking about it.  Um.  It, it happened six months ago.  It said, you're a weird dude.  What the fuck is up with you?  All these fucking sales end, uh, January 20th, 08.  That's not six months ago.  That's two weeks ago. 
[03:12:30]  Oh, because I, I just.  Three weeks ago.  I just got around to selling them.  The fuck is up with you, bro?  He's still, he's still selling the stolen goods.  So, you got caught, you went through all your thing, you still, you talked to the woman,  but you still sold the stolen stuff.  Why not?  All right, so the problem is not solved that.  That's my point.  No, no.  You're the same guy.  That's why I said, why would our shit be safe around you?  And you said, because I talked to a woman, but you're, three weeks ago, you're selling  stolen merchandise on eBay.  Yeah.  How much are you selling those, uh, maraschino cherries for, I see up there? 
[03:13:00]  What?  Three jars.  Wow.  No, I didn't take any of those.  Of course not.  No.  What's your record like on, uh, on eBay?  You got a good, uh, record as a.  What, 13?  100% feedback.  100% feedback on stolen merch.  That's great.  Yeah.  All right, so, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not proud of it.  I'm, I'm not proud of it.  I'd be.  That's pretty cool.  Actually, got away with it. 
[03:13:30]  Who else died beside your coach?  Well, my, uh, my grandpa did, uh, he did, he did, he wasn't like terminally ill.  He just kind of just, uh, instantly just kind of hit the deck, uh, randomly.  What was the name of your, uh, baseball coach?  Uh, Dave, uh.  Susala.  Throw that into Google.  How do you spell his last name?  S-U-S-A-L-L-A.  All right.  Gold star on eBay, huh? 
[03:14:00]  Not bad.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think, uh, I think Adam, uh, doesn't know who he really is.  You said Dave, right?  What was that first name?  Uh, Dave or David, however you want to put it.  I bet you that comes up accurate.  Sure.  I think he, I think he's just a compulsive liar, probably.  No.  I'm a klepto.  Klepto.  I'm not, I'm not a klepto.  He has shoes.  He doesn't know who he is, so he steals his shit from comedians.  Yeah.  To make himself more interesting.  I think you're afraid you're not going to be interesting. 
[03:14:30]  Like, why else would you take a Dane bit and make it part of your life?  Like, you don't do that.  Well, I, I have, I have tried it after I heard it, but, you know, I, I, I did, yes, I, I  did, um, steal that bit, and I, I apologize for that, Jimmy.  No, don't apologize.  You're not a comic.  I'm not saying it's wrong.  You told a chick a lie to make yourself interesting.  That's fine.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We've all done that.  Panning out?  Danny?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The Dave, uh, Susala thing looks to be legit. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah.  Yeah, so I'm starting to get a feel for this kid.  I think, uh, he's got some major issues, major, not little issues.  He doesn't know who he is.  He's, he's, uh, he's a weirdo.  A weirdo.  He's a weirdo.  You're diagnosing him as weirdo?  Yeah.  He's a weirdo.  Hmm.  It was creeping me the fuck out.  Then he has these moments of normalcy that, uh, I was just trying to get people on the  street to, to talk, uh, to Tony on the, on the mic.  Like, I was trying to just, like, block all my weirdness and all the shit going on, trying 
[03:15:30]  to get people to, to get good audio.  You don't own any guns?  I don't own any guns.  No?  No.  I, I was just, I was just trying to do my duties.  I try to block this stuff out.  I try to get the job done.  You know?  And, and I, I do have issues.  Um.  What are your issues?  Cause now you're starting to admit some shit.  You know, just.  Clepto.  Yeah.  Well, my, minor, minor, uh, cleptacy.  Clept, I don't know how to say it.  Cleptomaniac.  Cleptomaniac. 
[03:16:00]  And you lie when it's convenient.  Uh, you like to paint a picture of yourself that's not necessarily accurate.  Just spit it out, dude.  I'm an alcoholic.  I'm an addict.  I'm a sex addict.  And we all have character defects.  No.  Not all of us.  I'm pretty much close to perfect at this point.  No, okay.  We have a grandiose sociopath.  Everybody can't.  There's no one with them.  Fuck you, Jimmy.  Not even a boss.  You didn't even think about it.  Like, well.  Anyway.  And, and by the way, you said you weren't a clepto 10 minutes ago. 
[03:16:30]  Now you're finally admitting that.  I mean, I, I had some, I had some issues.  There was a period of time when I was just taking things.  Um.  You know, I, I do have some depression issues.  That I'm, I'm getting over.  And.  You know, I'm, I'm, I'm dealing, I'm dealing with those.  Right now.  And I'm, I'm, I'm just trying to think positive about, about everything.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Should we take a break?  Yeah, sure.  Yeah.  Let's let this all simmer and marinate for a little while. 
[03:17:00]  Danny, we could get a light detector guy.  That's what I'm hearing.  It'll take a few days just to get the money approved, but we could, uh.  Really?  We could do it.  How much is it, Dan?  I don't know.  Steve's working on it.  All right.  We're going to try to set that up.  We're going to do a moment of truth with you.  Yeah.  See, now that you brought it to everyone's attention, now we're going to end this thing  somehow.  Yeah.  Or this just ends up being just a boring hour of radio.  So now we've got to fucking hook you up to a light detector test to, uh, to fucking  save this shit.  No, you know, you know, I, uh, it's, it's not a bid. 
[03:17:30]  I, I, you know, I am who I am, you know, I can't, I really can't help it.  Puddle of, uh, puddle of aids.  Please let Kenny waterboard this lying prick.  Nah, Kenny.  I'm worried about your guy's safety.  No, I'm worried about his safety.  No.  I, Kenny, Kenny, Kenny and I do not, do not get it.  Kenny does not like me.  No, because he's, uh.  He probably sees that there's something off about you.  Yeah, Kenny's.  And you're not being genuine.  Kenny's a perceptive, he was an interrogator, that's what he did. 
[03:18:00]  Yeah.  No, he, he doesn't, he doesn't really like me.  Well, maybe we should get Kenny on the phone and find out why.  Is he still around or did he, he left, right?  Could interrogate you.  All right.  That'd be a tough interrogation.  All right, we'll do a lie detector test.  Thanks, Adam.  You're welcome.  There he goes.  Out the studio very slowly, very methodically.  Messing with his glasses.  Where's Poe?  As he steps out.  Poe's right there, behind you.  All right. 
[03:18:30]  He's a weirdo.  Poe?  Well, yeah.  You, Rocky, got anything on Adam?  Um, we're trying to get in touch with, I think it's his aunt over at Channel 11.  What?  Yeah.  He apparently has some kind of family member that works over at Channel 11 for the morning show.  Oh.  So, uh, Steve's trying to track down exactly who it is.  Because apparently this is the person that got him on, uh, Jill's dance Friday.  Jill Nicolini?  And I guess put in a good word for him for his internship, so.  Well. 
[03:19:00]  We're trying to track this person down.  All right.  Jill Nicolini is good if you're, if, if you're thinking about buying a bra.  Go to her for some advice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean.  All right.  Now that we're all fucking tired, we're going to regroup again because of another intern.  Opie and Anthony.  Today, we're going to talk to a man who says to have a deadly weapon to defend yourself.  I am an armed citizen.  How about that? 
[03:19:30]  Is this really paranoia?  I don't want to be robbed.  I don't want anyone in my goddamn house.  You're being attacked.  Your life is on the line.  What do you do?  Pile the bodies up at the door.  Do you have a knife?  Do you have all that stuff around?  What are you, crazy?  Why would I want to get into a knife fight with somebody?  How else are you supposed to stop somebody?  Get in their tracks.  I will have the AK and the AR, one in each hand.  Being overtaken.  Rally point.  Rally point.  Anyone coming in the bedroom door is completely exposed to my fire.  Zips in the wire.  I will fight it out till the end, till somebody's dead. 
[03:20:00]  Zips in the wire. 
[03:20:30]  On the radio.  And we're back.  The opening of the radio program.  I'm looking at Ass Girl from Cherry Darts.  She's wearing a green shirt.  I would like to see her hiney.  Even though I've seen you naked.  Her hiney, it doesn't even make me horny.  It makes me want to weep.  Like the way you feel when you see art.  Like when you see a sculpture.  You weep when you see art? 
[03:21:00]  I do.  I get misty-eyed.  I get all teary-eyed.  Yeah, she's sitting on her bed again.  Little green top.  Little spaghetti straps.  She's going to show her hiney.  And her panties.  Holy.  She's wearing like little panties with hearts on them.  And, um, yeah.  How does her boyfriend do anything but put his nose in her hiney?  Do you know how I would never work? 
[03:21:30]  I'd be late for the show every day.  They're like, what are you doing?  I'm putting my nose in my girlfriend's hiney.  I'll be at 730.  That's funny.  I'm going to get back on fucking PalTalk.  Hey, PalTalk, be Mac compatible, would you?  They're not listening right now.  Why?  They just don't listen.  Fuck them.  No, we got a guy in there.  Well, can he please be Mac?  PalTalk guy.  I have parallels and they suck.  Yet when the hell is PalTalk going to be Mac compatible?  There's the question for the PalTalk big wigs. 
[03:22:00]  Go ahead.  Email us.  More stories are coming in about Adam during the break.  I'm convinced he's the real deal now.  I think he's got some obvious issues.  Some lying issues.  Some other things going on.  Why are they waving at us?  They're waving at me.  Maybe they're waving at all of us.  Well, that's a good shot, dude.  Is that your girl?  Well, let's talk to him for a sec.  E-Rock came running in.  He had a fine Adam story where Adam started yelling at E-Rock and Steve in the office. 
[03:22:30]  Yeah.  Where's E-Rock?  Really fast.  Don't worry.  We're moving on.  All right.  And we got to get a mic on Gunshot Dude from Philly.  E-Rock.  So tell that story again.  I'll make believe I didn't hear it.  All right.  So we're in the office and Steve and I are discussing some audio that needs to be pulled.  And Adam is sitting on the couch in the office all laid back and calm.  Jumps up and starts yelling at me for knocking newspapers out of his hand yesterday as we were leaving. 
[03:23:00]  And I go, are you serious?  And he keeps going.  Like really just pissed off about it.  And Steve goes, stop it.  We're talking.  And Adam just keeps going.  Keeps yelling.  He's ignoring that Steve's even there and just yelling about these newspapers being knocked out of his hand.  So I see Sam in the corner laughing, thinking Sam put him up to this.  So I'm asking him, did you do this?  Sam, no.  He's going crazy.  He's been doing this all day.  He just jumps up and out of nowhere just starts yelling at people. 
[03:23:30]  All right.  There's no car crash there.  I just love his stories.  Oh.  Well, were you listening?  That's a little weird, though.  No, I know.  I know the thing was weird, but it's just, Iraq's got a way of telling a story.  Yes.  Not.  It's just.  I liked your story.  Kind of.  It's easy to make fun of you, but I liked the story.  Yeah.  It just gives more info.  You think I was up there with some of the other stories I've heard?  With the fucking crazy car accident one?  Yeah, that was a good one. 
[03:24:00]  Yeah.  Poe, new job.  Follow Adam the entire time he's in our presence.  That's your new job.  He's right next to me.  I see that.  Yeah, Poe's aware.  What is he doing right now, Poe?  He's just watching the wall.  He's watching the wall.  Yeah, he has his hands on one of the counters.  And he's just looking at the wall.  All right.  Staring at the wall. 
[03:24:30]  That's nice.  Can we read up on the Zoloft?  What does that prevent you from doing?  Killing y'all.  I know he learned that from Tyson from killing y'all, but what else?  What else is it for?  Because he admitted to the Zoloft.  All right.  Hey, Gunshot dude, what's up?  Yo, what's happening, guys?  Who's the broad with you?  That's my girlfriend, and she has a bit of a thing for Jimmy.  Oh, would you let her have sex with Jimmy in front of you?  I don't know about penetration, but...  I like this guy. 
[03:25:00]  They did catch us over.  One of our first dates, we actually sat at my place and watched Lucky Louie, the premiere.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I know.  It's a shame.  She's quite nice.  She's tall, too.  Glad to hear that.  How tall are you?  5'11".  5'11".  You know he tried to kill himself, right?  Did you know him when he was trying to kill himself?  No.  You think it's pretty sexy, though, that he did that, right?  I want to say sexy.  Yeah, that's right.  Throw me under the bus.  Good job.  He's very sexy, as you can see. 
[03:25:30]  Yeah.  He's terrific.  Yeah, she just doesn't want to get beat when we get home.  Yeah, that's good.  She's smart.  So you want to have sex with Jimmy?  Well, she's got a boyfriend.  They couldn't have sex.  Just say whatever you want to do.  I know you're not banged up enough, but go ahead.  I don't give a shit.  We just saw you at the Borgata.  It was awesome.  Oh, thank you.  Best commercial ever.  Except those retards ended up showing up at the end of the thing and screwing up your  whole set.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Real retards?  No, I wish.  That would have been...  No, no.  Real retards are on my shirt.  Special Olympics weightlifting one. 
[03:26:00]  I can't imagine this guy trying to kill himself.  He seems like he's so full of life.  He is full of life.  Like he's a very happy-go-lucky type of guy.  I know.  I don't get it either.  Right?  How long have you been dating?  Two years last week.  And when did he try to do it?  Three years ago?  Three, three.  Nah, three.  I thought I was going to try to blame it on you.  We actually met a bunch of years ago.  And by the way, he can't lie to us.  The gunshot wound is horrific.  Yeah, yeah.  It's in the middle of his chest, right?  Hey, a lot of my friends don't lie to you guys. 
[03:26:30]  He told one of the greatest stories ever.  Oh, thank you, sir.  It was amazing to hear about, you know, thinking about doing it and then sitting there going,  fuck, I didn't kill myself.  That was actually an accident because I was working and I heard that Jimmy was doing his  book signing and actually I was standing around with Happy Typing Girl and Anthony's  girlfriend the whole way up and they're the ones that actually prodded me on.  He got the book signed for me, from you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Oh, good.  Should you get naked in front of Jimmy, I guess? 
[03:27:00]  Knock yourself out.  I don't give a shit.  That's what the cherry darts thing is.  We did it already.  We did it already, but...  That's it?  Could you show Jimmy your naked body?  Go ahead, babe.  It's all right.  I know you didn't shave your legs, but it's okay.  You didn't shave your legs?  Ever?  Yeah.  Oh, she's like Chewbacca down there.  What?  She looks like the guy that got tased yesterday.  He's basically saying you're, yeah, hairy.  That's messed up.  Would you like to take off maybe the sweater? 
[03:27:30]  Honestly, it's cool.  I don't give a shit.  No one will grab you.  Just drop it off.  Yeah, just for Jimmy.  Come on.  You know, how many times have you said, oh, I love Jimmy.  Oh, you introduced me to him.  Oh, it's great.  All right.  All right.  She's taking her top off.  I just have a tank top on.  Keeping the halter top on.  The tank top.  Come on.  Don't be embarrassed.  She's got a great body.  Well, thank you.  She's 5'11".  Mm-hmm.  I think it's closer to six foot, but... 
[03:28:00]  Don't start whispering things.  Just say it in the microphone.  Yeah, I know.  You're whispering in two countries.  Would you like to, I don't know, flash Jimmy now?  In front of your boyfriend?  Go ahead.  Knock yourself out, kid.  I know it's just going to equate to better things for me tonight, so...  Oh, jeez.  You can flash.  You can flash if you're comfortable.  I won't honestly touch you.  I have a girlfriend.  Go ahead.  Come on.  You do have a girlfriend?  Yeah, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I do.  Well, what was that?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You were kind of bummed to hear that?  A little bit.  Usually he's willing. 
[03:28:30]  But your boyfriend's right there.  Yeah, but she's about, what, eight yards away?  Wait, would you, like, you would do an upgrade?  You would, you would just show him the door for Jimmy?  I don't know if that's an upgrade.  How big's your penis?  Mine?  I don't know, Escar.  It's a pretty good size.  Stay where you are.  I would hate to think I couldn't follow the gunshot wound guy.  I wish him in the hole in his chest was here fucking me properly.  Oh, God.  Yeah, from so much I've heard about your nice little ass, you know.  Mine got a bunch of zits on it. 
[03:29:00]  You don't want to see that.  What do you have?  Are they B's or C's?  I can't tell.  Put your shirt tight.  You can just pull it tight around you.  Is it, you know.  A B's is nice, right?  Just lift it up.  Jesus Christ.  They're like 30, uh, I was just saying 34 B, but I'm going to guess 36 because you're  tall.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's time to flesh, Jimmy.  She's a very athletic build.  She's very sexy.  Go ahead.  Yeah.  Knock yourself out.  Real quick?  Yeah.  Quick, long, whatever you want.  Yeah. 
[03:29:30]  Oh, come on.  That was real quick.  Even I know that sucked.  And I know.  What's your name?  Lynn.  Lynn, you're a little shy.  I am a little shy.  Are you a tiny girl?  No.  Irish?  German-Irish.  Okay.  German-Irish.  Do you wear a little panic?  Yeah, we like to keep listening to my Kraut-Mick friends.  Do you wear little thongs or what do you wear?  I like bikinis, thongs.  Oh, I like those a lot.  What color do you have?  They are.  Come on.  You already said you want Jimmy to sign your ass, so come on.  Oh, you do?  I know. 
[03:30:00]  I didn't bring a camera.  Set it on the way up here at the train ride.  Oh, we'll get a camera.  E-Rock!  I came from Philly.  E-Rock!  Oh, I was hanging out with E-Rock after the last time you guys were down in Philadelphia.  I wish they'd bring Lucky Louie back.  You and me both.  I know.  But I hear Jeff Bukes at Time Warner didn't like it, so we're finished.  It was terrible.  Did Adam steal Lucky Louie DVDs?  I was thinking of that, too.  Yeah, right.  Hey, why don't you tell them about how you passed out at the Louis C.K. show at Helium?  When I had to carry out when we were in the front row. 
[03:30:30]  Five minutes into a set.  They had to carry her out?  I was so excited.  I got a little too tipsy.  No exaggeration.  It was actually, I need another bouncer to help me.  I love that one.  What an alky.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Let's bring that one up.  No recollection.  No recollection of what happened?  You shave?  I shave.  Well, actually, I get waxed.  A little or a lot?  Waxed.  Waxed.  How much do you leave?  Would you take it all off?  She doesn't like Brazilian wax.  It's pretty sweet.  It's nice.  People are asking me, what does her body language tell you? 
[03:31:00]  Very obvious.  She wants to get so naked for Jimmy, but she's not sure if this is going to fuck up.  Go ahead.  I don't give a shit.  But it's so obvious.  She keeps looking at Jimmy, looking at him.  She wants to get so naked right now.  Go ahead.  She doesn't want to disrespect her boyfriend, but I think she kind of likes the idea of being  kind of sexy, but she's a little shy.  Because, again, we're on the radio and there's a lot of guys here.  Hey, I'm telling you.  She should have been made a fool of.  She can do whatever she wants.  No penetration. 
[03:31:30]  No, of course.  You want to show the panties, I guess?  Panties are harmless.  Wait, you want Jimmy to sign your ass?  Well, that's why I brought E-Rock in here.  E-Rock the camera, please.  Hang on.  And he's going to email you the picture and everything.  Are you serious?  Yeah, so pull down your pants.  Let's get it over with.  Come on.  Just do it.  I don't look at it like getting it over with.  Your parents don't have XM.  Don't worry about it.  The cancer oil I'm taking.  It's called getting you back, you asshole.  What?  You're going to really sign my ass?  Sure, I don't know.  I'll sign breasts and asses.  And he likes spanking asses before he signs them. 
[03:32:00]  It's the only rule Jimmy has.  I do.  Let me take this off.  I can't, though.  I don't have a problem with that.  What's that?  I said, I don't have a problem with that.  Go ahead.  I can't touch the ass at all except to sign it.  Oh, yeah.  That's right.  She does have a good ass.  I'll get hollered at.  She wants that?  I said she does have a good ass.  Oh, cool.  Can I see it?  I haven't done it.  She's going to get panties.  We've done anal a few times.  It was pretty nice.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  What's wrong with that?  Sometimes it felt like I was hitting a turd sometimes.  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  That's funny. 
[03:32:30]  You're on the air, right?  Yes.  You gave your penis a shithat.  That's hilarious.  Can I see the front of them, the panties?  Wait a minute.  Hold on, Jimmy.  Wow.  Very nice.  But first of all, we've got to know more about the ass sex there.  And why is Lily taking a peek at this fine woman?  Oh, that's Lily that's going to stay over at your house?  The ass sex is only a part of it.  Why don't you tell me about you and your friend one night when I came home?  What?  When I came home from when you guys were at the wedding?  Oh, my God.  Why don't you tell that story?  What happened there? 
[03:33:00]  Why don't you tell that story?  Tell that story, dude.  Oh, I'd love to.  I was working.  She was at a wedding solo.  So she brought home her one friend.  I show up.  So I start trying to get him drunk, which is just my MO.  So, and next thing you know, my beautiful girlfriend is having beautiful sex with her  beautiful friend.  And then I joined in.  It was a good time.  Is he white? 
[03:33:30]  Jesus, man.  Come on.  Is he a girl?  Here we go.  Wow.  That's pretty hot.  Are you bisexual?  That was the first time it ever happened.  It was a little scary.  She's a little embarrassed when you told that story.  But you shouldn't be.  That's very, very common.  It's with your boyfriend.  That's the way it should be.  I figured I'd throw her under the bus as soon as she got in here.  But that's not.  You're just making her a hit.  She likes girls and she takes it up to shitter.  You're two for two.  It doesn't get any better than that.  That's all I do.  Can we buy her a brain muffin and take her into the bathroom for you, brother? 
[03:34:00]  Why do you feel like you're hitting a turd?  That could be...  Yeah, you've never mentioned that before.  Something about the top of my cock, man.  What's that?  The top of my cock just felt like that little ridge just felt like it was hitting something.  I feel like there was a little hand in there saying stop, like a little palm.  Oh, God.  That's the asshole's palm saying stop.  Did your dick look like a bingo marker when you were done?  No, actually it was pretty dark and I just wiped off right away.  So who knows what the shirt looked like.  Oh, boy.  Now she's not going to want to do that anytime soon.  But she'll make sure that she funnels it out first. 
[03:34:30]  You've got to...  You've got to clean out the shitter first.  Yeah.  So I would let a dominatrix fucking ruin my asshole.  But I'm afraid I'd shit all over the fake dick.  Clean out the shitter.  Oh, what?  You mean just not make it look like parentheses?  Yeah.  Oh, you remember that verse?  A little advice to all the ladies out there.  You've got to clean out the shitter.  We're big fans.  Hose it out.  Hose it out any way you can.  Well, is E-Rock going to come in?  Oh, there you are.  Where's the mark on my young Eric friend?  Come on.  Trip down.  He forgets...  Yeah, get into panty mode.  Jimmy doesn't like to...  Eric would forget his incompetence. 
[03:35:00]  We've been sucking on morphine lollipops the whole way up.  So she should be pretty good.  I'm scared.  I don't know what to do.  Wait.  What's up with the morphine lollipops?  Hey, man.  I just finished my last one.  Sorry.  You were trying to get off the H, right?  No.  Hell no.  No, no, no, no.  No, I'm a pill head.  If that means heroin.  I'm a pill head.  If that means...  Yeah.  Yeah.  She keeps a little bit of a full bush.  Wait.  You were addicted to what last time we talked to you?  No, you don't like that.  I thought you were like a 15-year-old.  Everyone's talking at the same time.  I'm sorry.  That's all right. 
[03:35:30]  I don't know.  What was she going to do?  Pull down those pants and let me sign her ass?  Just get naked.  What's the morphine lollipops all about?  Oh, yeah.  I'd let you know that.  You never had one?  Oh, my God.  Beautiful.  And if you thought Vikings were great, suck on one of those for a little while.  I appreciate it.  I'm a Micah-in.  Have you shared who you're voting for?  Just curious.  I don't know if I want to vote.  I very rarely do.  Oh.  But probably Hillary.  All right.  Come on.  Let me show them a little bit of something before they get bored with us.  I don't know what to do.  I've never done this before.  You show me your hiney.  I'll sign it. 
[03:36:00]  Okay.  Stripping's easy.  Oh, he just wants you to strip.  Why don't you come over here and help her out a little bit?  Oh, shit.  Miss, you look like I'm going to fucking give you a needle in your bottom for fucking malaria.  I'm a nerd, guys.  Baby.  Oh, you are hairy.  So what?  I like the hair.  He's gone.  Gunshot dude's pulling down.  He's trying to show, you know, trying to be friendly.  I'm doing what I have to for the show.  He's trying to be friendly.  Hey.  Okay.  Don't touch.  I'm not touching.  No touching, I know.  Not at all.  You can touch. 
[03:36:30]  You can touch.  No, I can't.  No, trust me.  It's okay.  No, trust Jimmy.  He can't touch.  Hold on.  Best.  A little problem with missing it.  Best wishes.  I can't believe I'm doing this.  That's horrible.  I even had you sign a book for her.  Oh, I know.  Now they're kissing.  You guys want to have sex on the couch as we do line of the day?  I don't give a shit.  Yeah, I'm up for it.  You have a nice beard.  You think so?  You guys want to have sex while we do line of the day?  I'll fuck it.  Oh, I like this guy.  It raises it.  Let me see. 
[03:37:00]  I like this.  It's kind of sexy in the front.  You didn't answer yet, though.  You see the front?  A little hair?  I told her a little bit of hair.  I didn't properly groom for this.  So what?  It doesn't matter.  Close your eyes.  If you close your eyes, nobody else can see you either.  Nobody can see you.  What's that?  I deal with every day.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  But I don't want to be one of the jokes.  You all be.  No.  I've seen hairy vaginas before.  Isn't that nice?  I don't see the fat-ass Rachel Wright with a little bit of the stuffy.  Thank you, Fast Freddy.  I got confused.  I just got a picture.  Never run for office. 
[03:37:30]  Come on.  It's Jimmy.  Jimmy, what do you think?  What did you see, Jimmy?  Don't be mean.  It's not bad.  She probably does take good care of it.  She waxes a lot, probably.  But she probably just has it a little while.  It's winter.  Very nice.  I actually tell her girl a little bit.  I like it.  She's doing that for him.  I like a little strip.  Can I see your gunshot wound again?  It's been a while.  That's sexy.  That's sexy.  Jesus.  You think my gunshot wound's sexy?  Thanks, Jim.  Wow.  It's crazy.  Hey, man.  Shit happens.  Yeah.  All right.  So now they're going to have sex on the couch. 
[03:38:00]  Great.  You guys go over there and have sex.  I'll fillet him a little bit.  Get a gallon.  Will you do that?  No.  Go ahead.  Will you fillet him a little bit while I plug?  Jesus.  Hold on.  Jimmy's going to plug while you plug.  Will you fillet him?  Hold on.  Can this cocksucking be sponsored by a Tickets on Sale tomorrow plug?  Very nice.  Would you pop?  Would you?  I'll do it.  I'm a little.  Why is the dude naked?  Why not? 
[03:38:30]  Because he's going to get a Hummer.  He's got to be naked.  Come on.  That's it.  Why not?  Just for a second.  Where's Steve?  You know none of your friends have XM.  Go ahead.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Can I give us the radio?  No, really.  I know.  It's radio.  No, I can see it.  Are you serious?  Yeah.  Steve.  Hold on.  Wait, Miss.  You have to move your hair.  I can't see.  Steve, what's the problem?  Oh, we were just giving you a treat, Steve.  Why is he opening up his...  Steve, what's going on?  He's fucking a hot girl.  Yeah, we can't do that.  Oh, shut up. 
[03:39:00]  Ah, booey.  What?  What are you talking about?  Who's the buzzkill?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong with me?  Are you half a fag?  Yep.  What's wrong with anything?  Completely queer.  Okay.  Oh, my God.  Did Steve just, like, threw the speech on that one?  Why can't they have sex?  Because we've been told they can't do that.  This is satellite radio.  Yes, we've been told we can't do it on satellite radio.  But everything was free here.  Yeah, but we can.  But we can't.  It's what I heard.  I love.  I heard we can.  You're having different conversations than I am.  They're in love. 
[03:39:30]  Can I, um...  Somehow, I don't think that works.  Before we go, can I just plug this real quick?  I forgot I had tickets.  I'm sure it is.  Well, this non-blow job is sponsored by...  Tomorrow morning at noon.  Tomorrow afternoon at noon, the second half of my tour goes on sale.  Tomorrow I'll be appearing in, uh, starting...  I'm not going to give you all the dates.  You can go to my myspace.com slash Jim Norton.  Seattle, Portland, Oregon, Detroit, Michigan, Caroline's Comedy Club here in New York City,  Chicago, and Pittsburgh. 
[03:40:00]  Uh, all those dates are up on my myspace.  Um, so if you want to get tickets, all the links are there.  All right.  On my homepage.  And look at my myspace, because I...  There's a picture of me on a stool.  That's my headshot now that HBO took.  But my fucking idiotic, uh, radio, uh, uh, uh, personal appearance agent, like, morphed  out the stool.  So I look like I'm floating and shitting in midair.  I'm like, what the fuck did you do this for?  I gotta see that, yeah.  It's me sitting in the middle. 
[03:40:30]  I look like floating shit boy.  Floating shit boy coming soon.  Look, look.  Floating shit boy.  Look at floating shit boy, Ant.  Can you see him?  Look at floating shit boy.  Oh, that is silly.  What an asshole I look like.  Why is that like that?  I don't know.  Put, put, put something like, at least put a giant dick under there so I look like I'm  sitting on something.  Can I walk over and see?  Because I can't see anything.  Yes, sir.  Sure, come on, honey.  You can take your penis out.  You can walk over and look.  Well, yeah, but the dick's definitely been coming close to you.  There you go.  Yeah, you people are thinking of taking a fucking bump. 
[03:41:00]  So cute.  Oh, thank you.  See, she likes to.  She's funny.  Would you like it when somebody takes a bump?  I just think he's cute.  Thank you.  What would you do to Jimmy if you could?  If you didn't have a boyfriend and I'd have a girlfriend and, you know, she didn't  have radio.  Great.  Talk into that big black thing.  I like the way you take control and I would be open to suggestions.  Really?  Hair pulling?  Spagging?  She has a good mouth, too.  She likes to talk a little bit of smack.  Do you like to talk?  I like to talk.  Good.  All right, let's see her talk. 
[03:41:30]  Oh, jeez.  Yeah, close your eyes and talk dirty to Jimmy.  I don't know about that.  They don't want to hear me talk dirty.  Come on.  They're straight.  I mean, most of them.  She's not going to hear me talk dirty.  Yeah, talk to her.  Would you talk dirty?  I could.  I could.  All right, let's hear that.  Yeah, just close your eyes.  We're not looking.  I like, you know, a little...  Come on.  I can't just say it on my own.  Do you like...  Well, hold on.  Do you like your hair pulled?  Yeah.  Okay, so what would you do if I put my hands in your hair and I kind of held on? 
[03:42:00]  Not pulling hard, but just kind of gripped your hair and firmly controlled your head and  told you to get on your knees.  It'd be hot.  And now you got on your knees and I told you to unzip my fly.  What would you do?  I said, be hot.  I'd do that.  And what would you want to do if I took my cock out?  I might have to kiss it a little bit.  Okay, kiss it.  And if I told you to open your mouth and kiss it, make it really wet.  I could do that.  Okay.  Is that bad?  Wow, you're really giving a lot to go on, kid. 
[03:42:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She's a little shy.  It's okay.  She's not used to talking in front of a lot of people.  This is easy for me to do because...  And I'm not being particularly sexy with this.  I'm just throwing out...  What would you do if I do this?  I'm like throwing out question and answer time.  How about you sit down in the chair?  Sit down in the chair.  Yeah, sit down.  All right.  Get comfortable.  Yeah.  Now listen to Jimmy and this is where you're supposed to...  Yeah, sometimes in the heat of the moment, you know.  Of course.  Close your eyes, kid.  How do you like your nipples touched?  Do you like them touched soft or do you like them pinched a little bit?  Kissed?  A little kissed.  Now, do you like them, when they're being touched, do you like them soft or a little 
[03:43:00]  rougher?  A little more rough.  Okay.  So if you were kneeling down and let's just say that I told you...  Grab them.  Grab them.  Okay.  While I was in your mouth, I would pinch them.  Yes.  Okay.  I'm turning myself on at this point.  I'm actually squeezing my shaft.  I like when a guy takes charge.  You know.  I'm a quick learner, I think.  Do you like being...  A quick study.  Do you like being controlled when you're giving head? 
[03:43:30]  Yeah.  Do you like head freedom or do you kind of like to have your...  No, no, no.  I like some feedback and some direction.  Okay.  So if I was kind of fucking your mouth, what would you do if I pulled my cock out and  it was wet and I rubbed it all over your face and then I leaned down and I kissed you?  That's okay.  Okay.  So sexual.  That's okay.  No, no, no, no.  She's shy.  It's all right.  She's perfect for the remake of Twister.  No, I like her.  I like her.  It's like, I'm going to come in your mouth.  Okey-doke. 
[03:44:00]  She's just a little shy.  I don't want to say that.  I know.  I'm just teasing you.  Do you like to be...  So hair pulling is okay.  See, I think you have to know somebody first.  You don't just improv certain things.  You like to be talked to, to be instructed.  Would you buy me dinner first?  No, for what?  For what?  It's just going to come up when I gag you.  Just asking.  It's a 50-score when you're done.  By the way, Token Black fan from Boston writes,  Who who has chicks riding robot cocks and XM won't let you broadcast a blowjob?  It's mind-boggling.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It is mind-boggling.  Is she allowed to masturbate, Steve? 
[03:44:30]  What is she allowed to do?  You want to fiddle with that thing?  Sorry, Jimmy.  That's okay, please.  You're asking a question for the team.  I'm not going to argue with you.  That's a damn good question.  Is she?  Let's talk to the lawyers.  They'll always give us a fair...  Here comes Steve.  Is she allowed to masturbate?  Yes.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  Okay.  I just fed that to him.  All right.  Get yourself out.  You've got your little...  All right.  Now you can...  Gimmick, but...  It's okay.  Yeah, why don't you do that?  Because we need a good ending.  Because the show really...  I'll be honest.  It wasn't that good. 
[03:45:00]  It wasn't that good today over here.  Yeah, we had that good.  But if you do a little of that, I think people leave the show happy today.  A lot of people are still really pissed at Steve.  About what?  Really pissed at Steve for coming in and being gay.  Because she leaned over and she...  Unfortunately, that's my job here is to be queer and fuck up the show.  I like the fact that she likes to kiss a cock.  I think that's very sexy to have your cock kiss.  Steve, ask Logan...  Do you think so, Ian?  Hold on.  Ask Logan and Don Wicklund if we can do ass to mouth. 
[03:45:30]  Yes.  Please.  You know what happened the last time I called him out?  I like the sound of that.  Something like that?  Who gives a shit?  Yeah, they did it to each other.  Yeah, all right.  You must have hurt.  They did it.  All right, we're going to masturbate now, Jimmy.  Jimmy, is she going to masturbate for you?  I don't know.  Would you ever consider waxing at all?  I wax all the time.  I just...  I mean, taking it all off.  Even though you're...  Not right now.  Yeah, I did that, you know.  Your lips are kind of nice.  They're thick.  They're not tiny.  They're nice.  We do have duct tape. 
[03:46:00]  I don't know if I should say thanks.  Oh, yeah.  Of course it is.  Do you like them sucked?  Mm-hmm.  Are you able to come from a guy giving your head?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Do you like a finger inside of you or no?  Mm-hmm.  Nice.  All right.  Touch yourself.  Touch yourself.  Hey, I'm willing to wait.  Take one for the team.  Go ahead.  Are you too shy?  A little bit.  What are you shy about?  How about this? 
[03:46:30]  How about if you...  I didn't do that for him after two years.  What's that?  I haven't done that.  It's because we get right into it too fast.  How about if, uh...  Would it help?  I'm a little...  I'm not a big city girl.  I'm not from New York.  I know.  You're a dirty little shy girl.  I know.  She's probably going to be spanked.  You ever been bitten on your back?  Not hard.  Just enough to...  No, no.  No?  You probably like that.  You should bite her.  I don't know how your memory's doing.  I like a little biting. 
[03:47:00]  Yeah?  Now, when you've had anal sex, did you like it when he asked for it, or did you like  it just to be started, or did you not like it at all?  Just to be started.  Yeah, I don't like the asking thing.  Right.  So you kind of like, if a guy's behind you, just to kind of maybe grab your hair and kind  of hold you in place and just push it against your ass a little bit.  More like that, yeah.  And do you object, or do you just kind of understand that it's going to happen and take  it?  Well, the whole thing is, go slow, you know?  You can't just like...  Yeah, yeah.  I'm not saying, like, you're fucking, you know, you're breaking into a Dominican drug-dealist 
[03:47:30]  apartment.  You know, you're fucking battering, ramming in, and the police freeze, and you pull out  your fucking helmet, and there's mush on it.  That's really my biggest thing, is just, you know, I think it's slow in the beginning.  Do you like to be on your back when that's happening, on your stomach, or on your hands  and knees?  Hands and knees.  Okay.  Ask her if she's a fan of the pink sock.  Um, yeah, are you a fan of the pink sock?  I think from the earlier, I think she said. 
[03:48:00]  Like, if the guy pushes it in too fast and pulls it out, does your anus skin grip it,  like, not knowing that it's been pulled out, and go, hey, where you going, hey, where you  going?  And then it snaps back.  Like, the pink asshole skin is wrapped around the dick for a second, and then a cock pulls  out, and the skin, like the anteater nose, flops out, and then eventually gets sucked  back in.  But it looks like a pink anteater's nose.  Is Jackie Mason talking?  Yes.  Jackie, the pink sock, you put it in, it pulls out, it's got little shit on it, it looks  like the pink... 
[03:48:30]  All right.  All right.  She's being silly.  She's very shy.  All right, we have a conference call we have to get to.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That means we have to leave.  Oh, wow, look at that.  Well, you're not going to masturbate.  Right.  You know.  Hey, I said it was all right.  Yeah, I know.  Philly girls, I never have good luck with Philly girls.  They're nice girls, but I never have good luck with them at all.  Next time you're in Philly, give me a call.  We'll find you some.  Nah, I couldn't do it.  I had a girl.  You had to be faithful.  Yeah.  How is that going, by the way?  I'm a big fan.  It was nice to meet you. 
[03:49:00]  Thank you.  It was nice meeting you.  What about us?  Thank you for showing me your vagina for a half second.  It was the quickest pussy peek you've ever seen.  It was...  Come on, give us a good one.  Real quick, before we leave.  Go what?  You just get it.  We got like a three-hour train ride home.  Come on.  You don't want to regret this.  Just give him a good shot.  A peek.  A good shot of what?  There's a vagina.  Give me curtains.  Come on.  I did that.  It was quick though.  I couldn't see.  Jesus Christ.  You zipped him down.  In Auschwitz, they were more happy to take their pants off.  It's like a hummingbird swing going by.  Yeah.  I won't photograph it if you don't want to. 
[03:49:30]  I won't do anything.  I'll be a little nervous, but...  Don't be nervous.  She's like Adrian from Rocky.  I love this girl.  I want to throw a fucking turkey out the window.  Look at her dad.  Okay.  All right.  She's staring at Jimmy as she pulls down her jeans.  Yeah, don't be shy.  Oh, what the fuck was that?  Even I know that sucked.  It's got kind of plump outer lips.  Nice. 
[03:50:00]  She's shrugging.  It's what you like, Jimmy.  Trust me.  Is it why?  Tell me.  Yeah.  It's nice and thick down there.  It's good stuff.  I do like it.  Love it.  I like it thick.  Just to nibble on it a little bit.  I like to love it.  It slips together and make it look like they're talking.  And do cartoon impressions.  All right.  SkiColoradoNow.com.  She was willing to give him head.  But, you know.  But Steve had to ruin it.  That's right.  They're troopers.  She's a little nervous.  She's serious.  Next time, if you think you're going to be able to, we'll come up here and fuck. 
[03:50:30]  It's fine.  All right.  Well, maybe you should ask her, too, though.  Yeah.  No, she's cool with that.  Were you really going to have sex with him until Steve blew it?  Absolutely.  Thanks, Steve.  SkiColoradoNow.com for info on great deals on world-class resorts and up-to-the-minute snow conditions.  You'll log on to SkiColoradoNow.com.  Here is a runner-up line of the day.  But Jimmy's a pukesie, right?  Oh, boy.  What?  That's good.  Botulism?  Yeah. 
[03:51:00]  Wow, that sounded terrific.  I get a runner-up line of the day for a who-gives-a-shit line.  Yeah, well, he stepped on it, too.  Yeah, I finally get some recognition, and gunshot dude steps all over me.  Stand-off at L.A. home.  What's that about?  Here's another runner-up line of the day.  He goes to blow his brains out.  He shoots his ear off.  Right to the next runner-up line of the day. 
[03:51:30]  Are you ridiculous?  We can't leave a machine to mother.  She'll screw it all up, and father will have to punch her again.  If mother gets lippy, a little fist comes out of the glove compartment and punches her  in the face.  Free-  Very, very funny stuff.  The final runner-up line of the day.  He invented the peanut.  Before him, Charles Schultz was drawing a cartoon called... 
[03:52:00]  Oh, my God.  Stan's hearing this stuff for the first time.  Stan's back.  Yeah.  Here's your line of the day.  Here comes...  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  Line of the day.  We're interrupted by a member of the public trying to take a picture. 
[03:52:30]  This is not the photo wrecker you're looking for.  And that's how you executive produce.  Yeah.  Steve proved that today.  Had two interns running the show, and he wouldn't let us have, like, a sex act in the studio.  No.  Good job.  You earned your keep today.  All right.  I got to go.  I got to go do a photo.  What?  Our pal's BJ Shayne Seattle.  I got to call in 20 minutes.  Tell BJ I said hi.  I will. 
[03:53:00]  They're really good guys, man.  They're very supportive of this radio program.  All right, guys.  I'm going to give us a C-plus today.  No, I disagree.  I'd go up, just based on the beginning of the show, a B-minus, yeah.  We get an F-minus in my book.  In my book.  What is Adam doing now, Travis?  He's sitting in Paul's office.  Doing what?  Sitting.  Staring.  Isn't that where the weapons are?  Staring at a wall.  Staring at a...  Poor kid. 
[03:53:30]  He is quite crazy.  Iraq?  Why is Iraq?  He's being confined in Poe's office.  Poe's that freaked out?  No, Poe bought him a soda, so it's okay.  That's nice.  What, are you trying to get him to confess to a fucking murder in Baltimore?  Here's a soda.  You can tell me everything.  Brilliant.  Fucking Hattie has a long leather trench coat.  It's like a fucking Joan Jett video.  Just saying Crimson and Clover, and then fucking spin kick somebody in the teeth.  All right. 
[03:54:00]  I guess we're done for dinner.  Yeah, I gotta go and, uh, you know.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Boy, boy.  Yeah.  Okay, then.  Yeah.  All righty.  Have a good one.  All righty, then.  Are you a teesan?  Just turn us off, will you, please?  Okay, then.  We'll see you tomorrow.  Jimmy.  Good night, boys.  We didn't officially end the show.  Oh, no.  Jimmy, end it.  Jimmy, please end it. 
[03:54:30]  To Kipsey this Friday, Saturday.  Hey, no!  And then with a plug?  What?  All right.  I'll end it right if you want me to.  All right, yeah.  All right, I'm going to end this with a plug.  Um, listen, uh, we think we had a good show today, and, uh, you know, if you have your  XM radios, make sure you go to myspace.com slash Jim Norton to check out all my tour dates  going on sale tomorrow at noon. 
[03:55:00]  Is that a good way to end the show?  Yeah.  Yeah, I think that'll do it.  Yeah.  We got a conference call.  Let's just hold these fuckers for a while.  Yeah.  All right.  Go fuck yourself, fuckers.  We'll see you tomorrow, fuckheads.  That'll hold the little fuckers.  How many fucks could you get in one sentence, you think?  Uh, fuck.  Jimmy, you go first.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck load of fucks.  I'll bet I can say a fucking whole big bunch.  I can get more.  Fuck squared.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[03:55:30]  Plus one.  I gotta go.  I'm gonna be late.  Yeah.  Goodbye, guys.  Alrighty.  I'm gonna miss you.  Where are you going?  I gotta go home.  I was just gonna close the room.  Plus I'm practicing this dance that fucking Morris Day and the Time did.  Oh, wow.  That's lovely.  You ever just want to be a toilet seat with a mouth open?  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  She'd know I was her toilet, though, because she'd go, my toilet never went oop before.  Oh my God, you would not. 
[03:56:00]  Would you swallow a turd?  Again?  Have you really swallowed turds before?  Let me tell you, what am I, a fucking, what do I, have I never tried consumption?  What's the matter with you?  Come on, kid.  Consumption.  Q when you ask little questions.  Is it called consumption?  Why wouldn't it be?  I don't know.  Some doms specialize in  force conception.  Consumption.  Force conception.  They get all flustered.  It's called force consumption?  If they make you eat it.  Do they actually make you eat it? 
[03:56:30]  In some cases, I'm sure they do.  Some guys like that.  Some guys like shit in a blender and then they drink it.  Not my thing.  Sometimes you just hold a big solid one in your mouth  and you look up and you go,  I feel like a good one.  And it tips over on your cheek  and then you laugh.  It's like a big cigar, isn't it?  No, Jim.  It's shit.  This tape in Tough Crowd tomorrow.  Yeah, those were good years off.  Remember when we used to joke about the logs 
[03:57:00]  that would hit your chest?  Yeah.  If the girl had a really good diet  where it would just bounce off  and you would have to place it back on your chest.  What happens is the shit's laying next to you on the rug  picking up rug lint.  You just feel stupid.  It just rolls off.  You don't feel submissive  when it bounces off your chest like a marble.  That was fucking kind of awful.  Let me put it back here.  You really want it to go splat.  You want it to be thick and solid  and then just kind of lay on your chest mocking you.  You want it to feel like a train car pulling a missile. 
[03:57:30]  You don't want it to just bounce off  like you're on a trampoline.  It's awful.  Yeah, bowling ball on a trampoline.  This doesn't feel too submissive.  Let me put this here.  Yeah, you're right.  Here it goes.  Right back.  Let me help you.  Let me put this on the chest.  It keeps rolling so you get a ballast at the crook of your neck.  Like a fucking sausage.  A little hole in your neck.  All right.  That's how Jimmy and I would entertain ourselves.  We would talk about that for a long time.  All right.  Bye, everybody.  Yeah, there's no way to end this mess.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll just hit a button and that'll be it for today.  Friday tomorrow. 
[03:58:00]  Good.  All right.  Right.  Are you a woman looking to get off?  Then call the Jim Norton phone sex hotline.  I'll talk dirty to you.  I don't think you could either.  No, you're wrong, sweetie.  I'll talk dirty to you well.  Jim will personally guide you through your wildest fantasies.  Just take a listen.  All right.  I want you to picture yourself, uh, you're lying back and I'm there with you.  And, um, and then I take my underpants off.  Mmm.  I want to hold your legs open and tease your thighs.  Getting wet. 
[03:58:30]  And I start to lick all the way away from your crotch to tease you.  And I start licking down towards your knee.  Prepare to be ravaged.  I'm going to rub my butt right in your vagina.  And I'm going to start to turtle into it.  I'm going to hang a half a log out.  And I'm going to, like, hold it with my butt chutes.  And then I'm going to fuck you with my poop for a few seconds.  And I'm going to grunt and I put it in like this.  Want more?  Call 1-800-VAG-POOP. </pre>
