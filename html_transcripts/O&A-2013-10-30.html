<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about workplace dynamics, specifically the complexities of male attraction to women and the legal minefield of sexual harassment.  The conversation began with a seemingly unrelated topic: a school banning Halloween costumes. This led to a broader discussion of "diversity" and forced tolerance, quickly pivoting to a news story about Barney's New York and Reverend Al Sharpton's accusations of racial profiling.  This segued into a lengthy debate on sexual harassment lawsuits and the difficulties of navigating professional interactions between men and women.  A female listener, Lexi, called in to share her experience with childhood sexual abuse and its impact on her workplace interactions, further fueling the discussion about acceptable behavior and the enforcement of workplace rules.  The hosts, Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton, engaged in a frank and often vulgar conversation with callers, exploring various perspectives on the matter.

The show then transitioned to a discussion about unequal treatment of men and women in the workplace. A female nurse called in, stating her appreciation for sexual attention and criticizing the shift away from overtly sexualized women in advertising. The conversation broadened to human nature, fidelity, the overreach of HR departments, and the subjective nature of sexual harassment.  Several callers shared their experiences, including a woman describing a suggestive car salesman, men recounting uncomfortable workplace situations, and one detailing a false accusation of sexual harassment.  A caller working in HR offered her perspective on the frequent unsubstantiation of complaints.  The hosts interjected with opinions and humorous commentary, referencing Patrice O'Neal’s views on the topic.  Ian Halperin's upcoming appearance was announced, along with mentions of a Mike Tyson viral video, an upcoming "Jacktober" prank segment, a Mike Francesa impersonator, and a Kevin Pollak birthday celebration.

The "Jocktober" segment began with a quickly dismissed call about the Civil War.  The hosts then discussed the Mike Francesa impersonator before welcoming Canadian author Ian Halperin.  A humorous exchange about Ottawa followed.  A significant portion of this segment was dedicated to analyzing and mocking radio bits from "Mojo in the Morning," including a "Senseless Survey," a "Second Date Update," and a phone scam, highlighting their unoriginality and poor quality. Audio clips were played, with commentary on the bad acting and predictable storylines.  Listener tweets, both critical and praising Jocktober, were discussed.  The hosts also mentioned a suggestive photo circulating on the "Mojo in the Morning" Facebook page.  The segment concluded with continued mocking of "Mojo in the Morning's" lack of creativity.

A recurring prank segment followed, focusing on "Tony Pepperoni," who was tricked into sending flowers to a woman who wasn't his wife, Catherine. This led to Tony hanging up.  Further pranks involving fabricated calls to fictional stores ensued. Ian Halperin then joined the show, discussing his recent activities (intense tennis, a new TV show called "House Guest"), his books (including ones on Lady Gaga and hockey players), and various celebrities (A-Rod, Ozzy Osbourne, Mike Tyson).  The conversation was punctuated by sexually suggestive and offensive remarks from the hosts and callers.  Listeners called in, some praising Halperin, others making aggressive accusations.  A previous lawsuit involving Halperin and a claim of a video of him crying outside a Burger King were mentioned.  Halperin left for a one-on-one meeting.

A segment with Sam Roberts and Ian Halperin followed, beginning with promotional announcements for Jimmy Norton and various sponsors (GoToMeeting and MyPillow).  Artie Lange's book "Crash and Burn" and Russell Peters' Netflix special were discussed.  A large portion of this segment centered on Halperin's career, including his experiences with "The Governator" book, his bed-in publicity stunt, and the media frenzy surrounding Arnold Schwarzenegger's son.  Explicit discussions of sex, Halperin's sexual preferences, and experiences ensued.  Several phone calls from listeners, including "Lady Trucker" and Doug from Boston (quickly cut off), featured sexually explicit conversations.  A listener trivia question and further promotion of Halperin's reality show and Russell Peters’ special concluded the segment.

The final segment briefly discussed someone having AIDS, using graphic language to describe the location of the illness. The hosts expressed disbelief and used the term "vitriolic" to describe involved attitudes. A caller was mentioned but not directly heard.  A final plug for Ian Halperin's show and his Twitter handle, "Ian Undercover," was given, followed by promotion of the show's social media and broadcast schedule, and a transition to the "Ron and Fez" show with repeated shouts of "Hey!"


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, yo, what's up out there?  Nice to meet you.  How did I sit?  That is not good.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  If someone finds this offensive, just don't listen.  But my guess is, you'll be sitting around.  Let's do this.  It's going down jack.  Hey, it's Larry King welcoming you to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Right here on Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  Oh, this is good radio right here. 
[00:00:30]  Y'all are cooler and shit.  It starts funny and it gets very uncomfortable.  One of the most popular radio shows in the world.  Radio journalism at its best.  Hello, kids.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  They swear and they're vulgar and they talk about awful, awful things.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Very flavorful.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Please welcome Opie.  The show is twisted.  I'm telling you, we're enjoying this shit.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Anthony.  I want dick prizes.  I love when girls go through that.  I'm here for you, ladies.  Remember that.  That's what you like, isn't it? 
[00:01:00]  And Jim Norton.  If a pussy could talk, it would say, die.  That's what you like, isn't it?  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Oh!  Oh!  Clean it hard.  Oh!  Clean it hard.  Hard work.  Oh!  Good morning.  Welcome aboard.  Not enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[00:01:30]  That happens.  What are you going to do, you know?  Oh, boy.  Good morning, everyone.  Happy Hulk Day!  Ah, it would be.  Good morning.  Everybody getting ready for Halloween?  What is that, tomorrow?  Ah, yes, it is tomorrow. 
[00:02:00]  Wear your costume.  Go out trick-or-treating.  Well.  Well.  Well.  Well.  My kid's not allowed to have a costume in school, so no school for my kid tomorrow.  No costume at all?  Nope.  Why?  Well, Jimmy, some kids don't celebrate Halloween.  Thus then, no one's allowed to celebrate Halloween.  God, that's irritating.  It's so sick of it.  I mean, you know, it's one of our themes, and I hope we never let it go. 
[00:02:30]  It's always a little tiny piece of the minority that is controlling the majority.  Because, I mean, overwhelmingly, the school that my little kid goes to, he's only three,  overwhelmingly, they celebrate Halloween.  Of course.  And I bet you there's probably not even a kid in the school now that doesn't celebrate  Halloween, but it probably goes back a few years when they did have a kid.  Or maybe they never had a kid, but they assume if they do get a kid, he's going to 
[00:03:00]  be, you know, hurt, and the parents will be offended.  Why can't you just figure that shit out?  Why can't you, as a school, call the parents and go, you know what, maybe you keep your  little fuddy-duddy kid home today.  Right.  Because, you know, we got kids that want to celebrate Halloween.  They want to come in with costumes.  They want to, like, do a little trick-or-treating around the school.  A little fun.  Have a little fun.  So?  Well, you're a parent, though.  Have you said anything at the school?  Hell no.  It's like, nah.  I don't get thrown out. 
[00:03:30]  You should speak up.  I absolutely agree with you, and I haven't figured out how to do that yet.  I haven't figured out how, you know, how to do that without being, you know, too vocal.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You might be surprised if you said it nicely.  Well, everyone just rolls it up.  You might call the cops thinking it's, like, some school shooter.  Right.  Oh, my God.  He's complaining about it.  In this environment, everybody's just fucking on edge.  Excuse me.  I really think that the Halloween costume ban is, it's a little much, isn't it? 
[00:04:00]  Ah!  They're pulling fire alarms, calling the police.  I absolutely will say something.  I just haven't yet.  I feel...  Yeah.  My whole thinking is, because there's a few little things that have happened already, just  a little.  I told you about Leader for the Day, and they had to change it to Host.  So now my kid walks around my house saying he's a host.  I'm like, no, you're a leader.  I like Fuhrer.  Fuhrer would be nice.  Fuhrer for the Day.  Fuhrer for the Day.  They give him little armbands.  It's fun.  So there's a couple little things.  Yeah.  No fucking peanuts. 
[00:04:30]  You can't even walk in the school eating a little, like, peanuts.  Oh, hell no.  They fucking panic.  Peanuts like ricin.  They're ready to, like, hit a button where, like, fucking walls go down.  Oh, you think it's like...  To trap the parrot that forgot and came in with a little...  With a little nudge treat.  Yeah.  And a guy comes in an outbreak suit.  Right.  Takes the peanut with a pair of tweezers.  I think my thought is simple.  I wanted, like, there to be some time.  Just a little time to settle in.  And then I want to go have a little talk and really try to understand this shit. 
[00:05:00]  Because, I mean, I talk to the parents about it.  And they're all like, yeah, man.  Can you believe no costumes for Halloween?  Uh-huh.  So they can have an empty classroom.  Because, you know, Halloween is pretty fucking huge for little kids.  Breaking news.  I think they really enjoy it.  Yeah.  So, you know, by the time he gets out of school, you know, it gets dark at, what, 2.30 now?  Uh-huh.  So you got to keep him out of school so he can do some trick-or-treating.  You know, I haven't seen one positive aspect to diversity. 
[00:05:30]  I just haven't.  No.  I'm sorry.  No.  I see it's a very forced thing.  I don't think a lot of people really like it.  No one likes it.  You're supposed to like it.  But it's basic human nature not to.  And I don't see any...  Everyone's like, oh, this great diverse nation or this great diversity we have here.  I don't see one positive aspect to diversity.  Period. 
[00:06:00]  That's a little weird.  Just don't.  It seems like it's always a pain in the ass.  Something that has to be tolerated.  Be tolerant of this.  Why tolerate?  Why make it sound like it's some great thing when all it is is an intrusion on you?  It's a pain in the ass.  It's something you have to tolerate and accept and all this shit.  I can simplify it for you.  It's forced.  They're forcing everyone to have tolerance.  If it was something that came about naturally, then fine.  It would be great for the country.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  But you're just forcing people to do it. 
[00:06:30]  And it just gets everyone in a bad mood.  Right.  I mean, obviously not a popular thing to say.  Well, no one else is saying it.  I mean, no one.  I think we're the only show that sees it the right way.  Yes.  For whatever reason.  I guess because maybe satellite radio just doesn't have respect yet, so we're allowed  to fucking babble our asses off.  Eventually some people will come in here and start shutting us down a little bit.  I'm amazed at stuff we're allowed to say every day and we never get a talking to. 
[00:07:00]  And the same shit if you said it on MSNBC, CNN, Fox, anywhere else.  Anywhere else.  All these sports talk shows.  They shut you the fuck down.  Like, whoa, slow down.  Like the Dexter Manley thing.  Yeah.  That's a hot topic.  Like, that's becoming hot.  The guy was hilarious.  I'm sorry.  It was funny.  Just goofing about Troikman.  Troikman.  Troikman.  Troikman's a queer.  And, you know, all of a sudden they're going to ban him from everything. 
[00:07:30]  And there's a guy that likes, you know, he's a funny personality.  I don't think diversity is a problem.  I think it's the way people handle diversity.  Like, they don't know how to just be themselves around others.  Like, we've always been diverse.  Like, there's always been millions of...  No, there's this...  But now we're trying to push it forward, like, drastically is the problem.  Diversity isn't a problem when you have people from different places that assimilate to a certain way of life and a certain thinking.  There has to be a certain mindset when you come to this country. 
[00:08:00]  And there had been for many years.  But now diversity seems to be this intrusion on everyone else's...  You know, it could be diverse, but there's like ten different types of groups.  One group will intrude upon everyone else.  And then someone in that group will intrude upon everyone else.  Because they want this sacred fucking right to be their own people in the greater community.  Which just fucking undermines the entire community. 
[00:08:30]  Well, then the greater community...  It's the fault, again, of the greater community for not going,  No, no, no, we understand you speak this language, but English is the main...  Or whatever the issue is.  It's the fault of the greater community for not saying,  Well, this is the way we would like it.  It's been said, and then people come out of the woodwork,  Try to tell people they need to be proficient,  Or at least speak English properly.  In this country, you're called a racist, you're called a xenophobe, 
[00:09:00]  You're called everything.  Because you're saying that maybe you should assimilate more to this country.  Well, the majority's got to speak up a lot more.  Because even in my little environment, this little school thing that I talk about from time to time,  All the parents are like, what the fuck?  But just like myself, I'm to blame, too.  No one is speaking up about it.  We probably should all get together and go,  Look, let's get together and talk and go,  What is going on here?  Yeah.  We want our kid to be the leader for the day. 
[00:09:30]  Not the host.  Let him be the leader.  I think it's okay to give every kid an opportunity to be a leader at something.  I feel like he's the one that's in charge or responsible or has, yeah, yeah,  Been given a duty.  Oh, my God.  When you look at even the word melting pot, you know,  Melting pot, you put it in, it melts all together as something,  As one unit.  Now it's a melting pot with no heat put on it.  It's just a bunch of shit poured in a fucking pot that nothing blends together anymore. 
[00:10:00]  And let's be honest.  If you put too much shit in a pot and melt it down, it tastes horrible.  Terrible.  Horrible.  What, you want to melt everything in there?  No.  You ever bartend and you try to figure out a new drink and you put a whole bunch of things together?  That never works out.  This country has turned into a bar rag ashtray shot.  Yes, exactly.  It is terrible.  Exactly.  Yeah, that's what the problem is.  It's not like, because the diverse groups don't matter.  It's the fact that nobody is fucking, everyone just goes, 
[00:10:30]  Oh, okay, okay, okay.  Like, nobody knows how to telegroup.  No.  That's stupid.  Well, I'm hoping, I'm hoping, you know, these things hit the press  and you hope that this is the one.  Like Barney's.  Yeah.  Barney's has apologized.  Oh, God.  Did you see that guy being held hostage with Reverend Al yesterday?  Did you see the pictures of him?  Of course.  The CEO of Barney's is sitting in a chair.  And he has to deal with Reverend Al's scowl.  Surrounded by black people.  Right.  With Reverend Al, with his arms folded, scowling at this gentleman. 
[00:11:00]  You never want to be surrounded by black people.  Oh, never.  Never.  Especially when the news cameras are rolling.  Never.  Because it's not just, because Reverend Al has to really play it and have that stupid  scowl of his.  He was very disapproving.  I'm giving you an award when you're surrounded.  Look at this.  Look at Reverend Al's like, he's making a Michaela Maroney face at the fucking Olympics.  And it's all body language.  Look, Reverend Al has to have his arms folded. 
[00:11:30]  That says something, obviously.  And this poor fucking white guy from Barney's is just like, I'm not, I'm not head-knotting.  Well, now we hope that the Barney's guy hangs in there.  Every day we have one of these.  So this is the latest one.  And I'm telling you right now, without fucking Jay-Z, Reverend Al, you don't got shit.  Dude.  You don't got shit.  Yeah.  You need Jay-Z to pull his shit out of Barney's or you have nothing.  He ain't gonna do it.  So go march off into the sunset.  Because if you don't get Jay-Z on your side, this is a complete waste of time. 
[00:12:00]  Do you know what that picture looked like yesterday when I first looked at it?  The first thing I thought of was fucking Captain Phillips, the boat movie.  There's the poor hostage.  Yep.  And he doesn't know what to do with himself.  He's the latest.  And you know, Reverend Al's not as impressive with the scowl and the arms folded now that he weighs 117 pounds.  I know.  When he was a big fat fuck with a fucking license plate around his neck.  Oh, yeah. 
[00:12:30]  That was a lot scarier.  Yep.  Al Sharpton.  What does it say?  He defends Jay-Z amid Barney's racism?  Of course.  Yeah.  He defends Jay-  Of course he defends Jay-Z.  Because Reverend Al will always see just one color.  It's all about the money.  And that's the problem I have with Reverend Al.  Because if that's a white rap guy that has his shit in Barney's, Reverend Al is not defending him.  No.  Period.  And we all know that.  What did he say about-  How did he defend him?  What did he say?  He just said this is not about-  Oh, what's that? 
[00:13:00]  He said this is not about Jay-Z.  It's about Barney's.  Oh, okay.  So if people want to still invest and support Barney's.  Because he wants to go to Jay-Z's parties.  I like how Reverend Al is calling for a boycott of Barney's.  But isn't that what Barney's wanted?  No black people in their store?  It's like, what are they doing?  God damn it.  That's funny and hilarious.  That's very funny.  Reverend Al should just encourage Barney to go shop there.  That would annoy them.  That would really annoy them. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, man.  That's really funny.  Like, our plan worked.  But look, we're to a point where something got fucked up over there.  Barney's.  I don't know exactly what.  Because the CEO's blaming the NYPD.  The NYPD's blaming the CEO.  Yeah.  So they're going back and forth a little bit.  But I know this much.  Barney's apologized.  Yeah.  So that should be the fucking end of it.  And they're looking into it to make sure this doesn't happen anymore.  No, of course not.  Because it's never the end of it.  We all know that now.  I demand a Reverend Al section. 
[00:14:00]  You demand an apology and that everyone gets fired.  That's how this always works out in the end.  Yeah.  So until some people get fired, Reverend Al's going to be a fucking pain in the ass.  Oh, yeah.  That's what he does.  To Barney.  And for some reason, we have to put up with what Reverend Al does.  Yeah, because why would the cops just stop you walking?  Like, how would they know you even shopped there?  How would they even know?  It doesn't make sense.  Someone called.  Yeah.  Someone called and said, hey, this guy just bought something very expensive.  I think he might have a stolen credit card or something. 
[00:14:30]  And the cops checked it out.  The cops just don't, you know, poke around like that.  It's not really a stop and frisk moment.  Yeah.  And Macy's, too.  They're getting off because Barney's is higher end.  Yeah.  And Jay-Z's tied in with Barney's.  But Macy's is kind of getting a free pass.  The Treme actor is suing them for a lot of money.  They put him in cuffs.  But that's all you need to know about Reverend Al.  Well, that he's defending Jay-Z.  He would not defend Jay-Z if he was white.  And again, in a New York City store, not that you could argue the ethical and constitutional rights that people have. 
[00:15:00]  But when you look at loss prevention statistics in New York City, a majority of the loss is going to be chalked up by black people.  So, it's very difficult to say, well, you know, of course we'll be suspect.  And how many other people are actually buying stuff in there with nary a problem, you know, when you think about it? 
[00:15:30]  So, one or two people get the brunt of what happens on a daily basis in some of these stores?  I don't know.  I don't know, man.  That's one where it's like you hear too many...  This is where black guys will go, you just don't understand.  Yeah.  And I literally would love to go around in blackface and see what...  Like, the guy who did that thing called Black Like Me, that book.  Right.  Like, I'm curious, because maybe that's just something that we don't have to deal with.  Yeah, yeah.  But they say...  Like, even guys I know who are not... 
[00:16:00]  They're like, you just don't...  How annoying that is when you're walking in and you're literally doing nothing wrong.  Because if it happens, I mean, you know, in our lives, it might happen to us once.  Right.  Maybe.  And it pisses you right the fuck off.  It's really frustrating and annoying, yeah.  I agree with you.  Yeah, I mean, you know.  But, I mean, the point here is that Barney's has done enough, and that should be it.  But you watch how Reverend Allen just keeps pushing and pushing.  Oh, he'll want some type of, you know, guarantees and some fucking law.  And certain hiring practices. 
[00:16:30]  Right, right.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah.  He'll want sensitivity training for all the employees and all that happy horse shit that  all comes back to what we originally started talking about this morning, which is diversity  and all this political correct bullshit.  I don't think you could teach diversity.  You can't.  You can't.  Maybe a little bit.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Do you think it's basic human nature overall for people to want to be with people of their 
[00:17:00]  own kind for the most part?  I think it's basic human nature.  And if you look at the way people socialize, I think you see that a lot.  I think you're pretty accurate.  I think so.  Tribal.  It is tribal.  It's a very, very primal thing.  But I think it's also financial, too.  Yeah, yeah.  Finance comes into it.  Yeah.  I think there is a lot of, like, probably nature versus nurture thing, even where that's  concerned, where people just feel safer in a primal way, in an animal-like way, with 
[00:17:30]  people of their own ilk than they do strangers.  Strangers and people that are different always conjured up fear in people.  I think eventually.  Yeah.  I'll just talk about America.  I think eventually everyone will kind of get along way better.  You think?  But the problem is we're trying to push that forward drastically instead of letting it  happen naturally like you were talking about.  You can't legislate things like respect.  Let it be a natural evolution of the people, you know, as we slowly break down, you know, 
[00:18:00]  barriers and walls and this and that.  But you can't push it forward like we're trying to do.  It's not working.  It even works with the sex thing because, like, a woman in the workplace, they legislate against  any type of sexual harassment.  That you can't legislate against a guy looking at a woman's tits or ass or thinking she's  attractive.  That's something that won't go away.  And when women talk about things like, you know, we don't want to be looked at as a sex 
[00:18:30]  symbol.  No, you don't want it to come out verbally or, you know, between two guys talking or overhear  something or see something that was left in someone's cubicle because you can't make  it stop.  It's not going to stop.  And it's the same thing with race.  Wow.  You make it's the same thing with, you know, religion.  You make a really good point there.  I think every single human being without exception wants to be looked at as a sex symbol. 
[00:19:00]  Probably.  Yeah.  So if if you know, when when whatever I was going to talk about, you know, some skirt.  I was going to know when someone says something about myself, it makes me feel like, well,  OK, everyone likes if you have a use to be careful about what I'm saying.  But I think even women, man, that when they could go to work with their cleavage hanging  out and their short skirts and their ass popped up.  They want guys and maybe if they're into women, whatever, you know, gawking going, oh, damn, 
[00:19:30]  look at that.  And they feel good.  Like, yes, see, I still got it.  And people find me sexy and sexual.  Don't you think that gives somebody a feeling of power?  And then if someone uses that and you feel you're being sexually harassed, that gives  you even more power.  I just want to clarify for the audience.  Yes.  If they're listening, that this is is not 1957.  We are in 2013. 
[00:20:00]  I just want people to know that.  Unfortunately, I made a really good point there.  Like, everyone wants that.  But as soon as you vocalize that, right, then there's a then you're fucked.  And obviously, you can't, you know, say something over the top ridiculous.  But even if you say you kind of said it, even if it's just a subtle thing, you might  even go, oh, I like your dress today.  That could be enough to get you in the H.R. office.  And in the 50s, it was like you would have had to, you know, get get up here on my lap  and take some dictation. 
[00:20:30]  I think as long as you're not showing skin, meaning your own dick, back in the day, you're  all right.  Anything else goes.  Yeah.  But the reason we have this, believe me, I get annoyed at it, too.  But the reason we have stuff like forced diversity and all that shit is because it wasn't done  voluntarily.  And I agree with you about it's natural to want to be with your own people because we're  scared.  But it's also natural to club people over the head.  I mean, we're apes.  It's natural to fucking to just take pussy.  It's natural to shit in public.  Thank you.  All these things are a learned behavior.  It's not the expressway. 
[00:21:00]  But you know what I mean?  You know, when you live in a civilized or comfortable place, a lot of what's natural  has to be overridden, kind of.  It's just the speed we want it to happen.  That's true.  And that's the problem because you can't legislate the way people feel.  You can't legislate against prejudice.  You can't legislate against sexist thoughts.  Um, so that's what makes the conflict because people are still feeling that they're still 
[00:21:30]  thinking that it's like, oh, we want to be respected.  Well, you can't make someone respect you.  You can't make someone like you.  You know, it's, it's just the way it is.  And I think there's that, that phoniness that comes with, you know, pushing it on people  that, uh, is so annoying.  Yeah.  But stuff like what happens is if it wasn't, you can't legislate the emotions and the feelings,  but you can only, you can legislate penalties for not behaving.  Oh, exactly.  Absolutely.  And that, and that's why there's more diversity in the workplace.  And I'm not, I'm not saying it's a bad thing in that respect, but you're not going to make 
[00:22:00]  people like other people, want to work with other people, um, not look at a woman's fucking  tits or ass when she walks by, uh, you know, so, so the whole thing is, is in essence a lie.  Then every woman should go to work in a potato sack.  Oh, sexy.  I mean, you see these, we see it here.  I'll put my potatoes in there.  Fuck.  We see it here with how some of the women dress. 
[00:22:30]  Uh-huh.  But man, they're trying to be sexual, but if you say anything that is sexual, you're fucked.  And everyone's petrified.  You know, like everyone knows not to say anything anymore.  You don't, you don't, it's not like the old days are fucking some girls walking down  the hall and you go, woo.  Not that would get you fucked right there.  Right.  And everyone knows that.  Look, man, cleavage, you know, creates boners, period.  Cleavage creates boners.  It just does.  That's, that's great.  But it does. 
[00:23:00]  Of course it does.  But we're not allowed to, you know, show any sign that maybe that was some kind of, you  know, a natural turn on to the man.  Yeah.  It's, it's, it's unbelievable.  If companies had fired people who really were being shitty about it, they probably would,  we wouldn't be in this place.  You know?  No, that's what, but it's giant, it's all lawsuits.  It's all because companies allowed a fucking, a guy who was doing it, who was actually a  good worker to continue to stay even after he had a terrible history of harassing women. 
[00:23:30]  So all that, and that's why women are winning all this money in these lawsuits.  So had that not happened, had companies done the right thing and fucking fired guys who  were truly scumbags, we probably wouldn't be in this place.  Had fucking schools not been forced by the, with, with, with, with the National Guard  to let certain other citizens into them in this great place of diversity, we probably  wouldn't have diversity forced down our throats.  But because every time it's happened, it's had to be, uh, uh, forced and through the courts,  you, you build up that, uh, I guess that, that pattern of behavior where, 
[00:24:00]  it has to be forced or it has to be legislated.  When was it done voluntarily?  I, I, I understand all that.  It's just, I don't, I still don't see the upside to it.  Uh, I mean, maybe way down the line in the future, there'll be some weird cosmic upside  to it, but it just seems to me that every word that goes along with diversity is this  negative thing where it must be tolerated.  You know, we have to need tolerance, acceptance.  These are things that people don't want to do. 
[00:24:30]  Those are nice words though.  Well, you think, to tolerate something is not to like it.  You don't like it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You don't, you don't have to tolerate it.  Yeah.  It must be tolerated.  Like it was Brussels sprouts for us.  We had to tolerate eating Brussels sprouts.  Yeah.  No one really thinks that when it's like, we need to show tolerance with this or that  or the other thing.  No one really looks at the word.  The word isn't something that people don't do.  Tolerate is a horrible word.  Oh, I tolerate it.  Right.  We were forced to eat shit growing up and, you know, we had to tolerate it. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  By the way, remember when I said everyone wants to be looked at sexually?  I forgot one group of people and we got one on the line.  Uh-oh.  Lexi in Maryland.  Lexi.  Hey, guys.  How are you?  Hello.  Hey.  Hi.  Um, you know, I'm, I'm a business professional.  I have an MBA and I want to be looked at as a...  In the NBA?  You want to be what looked at?  I want to be looked at as a colleague.  I don't want to be looked at as a sexual being.  And you also have to remember, people have different histories.  I was sexually abused as a child. 
[00:25:30]  If you look at me...  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, goodness gracious.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Lexi.  What were you saying?  I'm sorry.  Something happened.  Sorry about that.  Yeah, no problem.  I love the apology.  Yes.  What were you saying?  You don't want...  You were sexually abused as a child. 
[00:26:00]  So, obviously, you don't want to be looked at sexually.  Exactly.  Because it causes a trigger for me.  And you have to remember, one in four girls are sexually abused by the time they're 18.  We'll get those stats up.  I'm sorry.  One in four girls are sexually abused by the age of 18.  But Lexi raises a good point.  I'm not a woman.  But you think of some female lawyer in court once people, like, looking at her...  Like, you know, or wherever you are.  Like, it's got to be irritating after a while.  It's basic human nature to want to be looked at as an attractive being.  Absolutely.  Right? 
[00:26:30]  Like, Lexi.  But let me ask.  Let me ask.  Okay.  Maybe you're on the same path.  Yeah.  Lexi, so now we understand your history.  How do you go to work, then?  You must dress really, really conservative.  A suit of armor.  No, I don't dress conservatively.  I dress in clothes that appropriately fit my body.  However, I'm not at work to be leered at.  I'm not, you know, I don't walk out of the house to be leered at.  Yeah, but if you have, like, a tight skirt on or you're showing a little cleavage, you know, I mean, guys can't...  We can't help ourselves. 
[00:27:00]  That's attractive to us.  I understand.  So you are going to be looked at sexually.  Maybe people aren't going to verbalize that, but it absolutely is happening around you.  I understand.  I just wanted to clarify that not everybody wants to be looked at sexually.  I do not want to be looked at sexually.  Fair enough.  Because of my history.  But, Lexi, do you want to be looked at as, wow, that's an attractive woman?  I think I take care of myself. 
[00:27:30]  I think that I am very presentable.  I mean, everybody wants to be presentable.  Right.  But doesn't it feel good that somebody would look at you, regardless, a man, a woman, a child, anyway,  would look at you and think that you're handsome or pretty or, you know, don't you want that?  Isn't that a basic human thing?  I think that we all strive for that.  That we all strive to put on our best way.  Right.  Sort of what we're saying.  However, whenever you're saying that everybody wants to be looked at sexually, that is not 
[00:28:00]  true.  Well, guys are looking at women, but you're saying not every woman wants to be looked at  sexually.  My mistake was saying every single person, but the majority of people certainly want to  be looked at sexually.  Okay, so we all do.  But how do you feel?  Hold on, Lexi.  Opie and I go to the same gym.  How do you feel like when that creepy guy is around, do you feel sexy when he looks at you?  But you know what I'm saying?  I got a vibe from those guys in the gym.  I'm like, ugh. 
[00:28:30]  Really?  It makes me enraged when I know that guy's trying to look at my ass.  It doesn't enrage me.  It makes me laugh because I find the humor in that.  I'm not bothered by it.  But if you were working with that guy, and he was fucking, like, for real, you'd hate  his guts.  I'd be all right.  I mean, I'd be all right.  It was every guy, not just that guy.  Yeah.  Whatever, man.  Then I got it going on.  That gave me an insight, dude.  That fucking feeling.  Really?  Yes.  In the gym, in the locker room, a guy trying to look at my dick. 
[00:29:00]  It just, it made me so fucking angry, and it shouldn't have.  But it really annoyed me.  It doesn't bother me because I know I'm not doing anything about it, like, you know?  Oh, his sneaky little peeks.  I was trying to go, what?  Fucking cocksucker, what?  It makes me giggle.  You're fighting nature again, though, too.  I mean, you know, girls like Lexi.  You're fighting basic human nature.  There's that animal instinct of a man that looks at a woman and sees her as a sexual being.  You know?  You know what? 
[00:29:30]  Certain women at work would go, tough shit.  It's the same as a guy who robs you going, animal instinct.  I see what I want, and I take it.  Well, okay, and animal instinct, I'll turn around and shoot you in the face, defending  my fucking kill.  But the point is, that's, you're right, but that's, you can't think of it that way.  But as humans, we like to think we're much further advanced than that, so we put on this  facade, and we fake that we're tolerant, and we fake that we're not these sexual beings,  and we're not oogling at these girls that might come to work a little scantily clad. 
[00:30:00]  It's this fucking charade that goes on, where everyone's, it's not sincere, it's just like  It's not working.  It's just like the apologies we see on the news from people that use language that they  completely mean, and were sincere when they said it in the first place.  It's a big fucking lie.  Everyone's lying to each other.  It's not working.  Right.  We're making believe there's diversity.  Exactly.  I completely agree with that.  Correcto mundo.  And as far as, I can handle myself, so I don't care if the guy, I laugh at that. 
[00:30:30]  I giggle.  It annoys me.  I laugh.  It just makes me giggle.  Hilarious.  You put his dick in your mouth, you laugh, you laugh.  No, no, no.  Dude, that's the first time I ever felt that way.  It really was like, it made me angry, just because I don't like this guy's vibe.  Wow.  Did you pull your towel a little tighter and, oh, no, but I wanted to say something really  Call him a masher.  Like, I'm such a fucking, and I see him almost every day, and I wanted to say something nasty.  Like, fucking, like.  You should then.  Fuck it.  No, because I don't know if it's my own imagination, and it's like, again, it was like, it's not 
[00:31:00]  worth getting.  Fantasizing.  Yeah, you can't, you can't prove anything.  It's like, you can't, he hasn't done anything.  I just know I'm getting irritated.  So, if dealing with that all the time from every colleague, or 90% of the colleagues,  would be fucking, because it was unwanted attention.  Do you understand this guy creeped out, Jimmy, people?  I just want to, I just want to really, really put that forward.  You should walk around with a raging heart on it, basically saying, you can't have this.  And let him, watch him lose his fucking mind. 
[00:31:30]  A lot of people want to argue with Lexi.  I hope I picked the right guy here.  We'll go with William in Jersey.  You're on with Lexi.  Oh, Bill.  Yeah, it's perfect.  The reality is that, you know, this is really a subjective question.  If Lexi's looking hot, and she's at work, and a really good-looking guy who's interested  in her might be flirting with her, she might be like, oh, very nice, very nice.  And might even, you know, she might even go back and flirt back, but if it's a fucking  troll, you know, Big A, or someone like that, flirting all of a sudden, it's an HR issue. 
[00:32:00]  And that's really, and that's really the problem.  Wow, William, you make a great point.  You make a great fucking point.  That's the, that's the really fucked-up thing, is that, yeah, everyone wants to look hot.  Everyone wants to be desired, but they want to be desired subjectively by someone who  they're attracted to or they're interested in.  But you can't have it both ways.  Right.  You can't go into work looking hot and expect all the really good-looking guys that you're 
[00:32:30]  attracted to to be interested in and everyone else to fucking walk away.  It's clown shoes.  It's clown shoes.  I like that.  I mean, I hope people aren't confusing the issue here, what we started.  I don't think it's okay for guys to just walk around and be like, hey, nice tits, honey.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm talking about the subtle shit that'll get you in trouble.  And you can apply this idea of subjectivity to just about anything, you know?  You know, obviously, you know, if you're an inner-city, you know, black kid and Jesse Jackson 
[00:33:00]  comes up to you and gives you some attention, you know, because of your color, you're going  to be like, yeah, all right, but if it's the police or something like that, you're not going  to like it.  So it's really, it's not just about, you know, look how successful our politicians are catering  and pandering to these smaller minority groups because they give them what they want and  they're giving them the attention and they're powerful politicians, so they want that. 
[00:33:30]  But if it's someone else, no, I don't want it.  Let me ask you a question, and you raise a point about wanting someone attractive to  flirt with you, of course.  But the problem is the companies have over historically didn't fire people when it, I  don't think anybody was suing because of light flirting.  Hey, the ugly guy in the mailroom smiled at me and asked me out once.  That's not what the lawsuits were about.  The lawsuits were about, when you like would read them, you go like, oof, like how the fuck  did the company let that go on?  That's where it became a problem.  Okay, but why is it then because that happened and light flirting is not okay now? 
[00:34:00]  Ask the companies.  I know, I understand your point.  There's times where, yeah, that's completely unacceptable, but what ends up happening is  then they go, well, this particular thing, you can't pinch someone's hiney at the workplace,  but now you can't even have a calendar up, you can't even pretty much say hi to a woman  that's not in your department in the hallways.  It's gone way the other way.  Yeah, they wipe the whole thing out.  But that's companies, that's companies, that's individual companies. 
[00:34:30]  It's all companies at this point.  It's not even individuals anymore.  Oh boy.  No, no, no, but I mean companies as, like Sirius never talked to CBS.  They're both doing the same thing though, just as individual separate entities.  They all see the lawsuits and they're like, nothing, zero tolerance.  But you're making my point because going back to the Halloween costumes, it was just one  kid felt left out or alone that day.  So, okay, now we have to wipe it out for everybody.  Right.  That's crazy to me.  This goes back to the point that it's the fault of the people who are bending over irrationally. 
[00:35:00]  And somehow we all got to speak up more.  Getting back to that original point.  Yeah.  Poor guy.  Sorry.  Or maybe the problem, maybe the problem is, is because they're not speaking up enough.  What they're doing is that when a cute guy comes and hits on them, they let it go and  let it happen because they have some interest in that person.  But all of a sudden when a guy maybe, you know, who maybe isn't as desirable, all of a sudden 
[00:35:30]  it's an issue.  And what they're doing is they're selectively, you know, selectively choosing who can flirt  with that and who can be inappropriate with that.  Do you really think that's where, do you really think that's the history of sexual harassment  in the workplace?  Like, I know what you're saying, man, but do you really believe that's where it comes  from?  A bunch of girls who weren't happy that it wasn't the cute guy?  Like, you don't think that there was any pattern of tolerated bullshit?  Like, you want your wife or girlfriend treated the way a lot of women have had to be treated? 
[00:36:00]  And I'm not talking about the overreacting woman who freaks out if you wink at her.  But you really want your, I don't know if you're married or not.  If you walk into a woman's cubicle with your dick out the front of your pants, you need  to be fired.  It's not even that extreme.  No one does that.  That's a crazy example.  Right.  Probably started with that.  That never went on.  Yeah.  What I'm saying, and how I agree with Anthony, is that human nature for men and women sexually  or human nature in regards to politics or whatever, everyone wants to be like, everyone wants 
[00:36:30]  to be loved.  Everyone wants to be viewed as being sexually powerful.  Are you?  Everyone wants to be protected.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  She's right.  Oh, boy.  Look out.  I forgot all Mrs. Glass ceiling is fucking on the line here.  Jesus Christ.  Wait, let Lexi respond to this guy.  She hasn't said anything.  Lexi.  Let Lexi respond to you.  Wow.  Wow.  You have to remember that there is a time and a place for everything. 
[00:37:00]  The workplace is not a place.  You've got to pick up women.  If you want to pick up women.  Oh, I don't know about that.  The oldster did pretty good back in the day.  Some numbers?  I put up some numbers at radio stations.  I'm telling you right now, Lexi, you're absolutely wrong.  I think there's a lot of guys rolling their eyes right now.  They did very well in the workplace.  Yeah, absolutely.  They did very well.  I said it's not the place that you go to pick up women.  But it happens.  Well, sometimes relationships are forged in the workplace.  Yeah. 
[00:37:30]  You've heard of happy hour, haven't you?  And now a lot of companies frown on that.  And if you do have a relationship to develop into a marriage, one of the people has to leave.  That's a good point.  There's a policy here, I think, you're not allowed to, like, date someone.  You know what that is?  Oh, me and Jimmy have had to keep that quiet for years now.  Oh, my God.  You know how hard it is to just jerk each other off in the restaurant real quick?  So you have a natural attraction to someone you work with, and these companies will not allow that to happen.  Thank you to workplace shootings and all that stuff. 
[00:38:00]  They don't want a relationship going wrong and having the whole environment being fucked up because two people are fighting or one guy gets violent or clinging and then you break up and then the dynamics of work are fucked up.  I know of someone that had to keep their workplace relationship very quiet around here.  Oh, around here.  Yep.  Wow.  Let me think.  I don't know if that person wants to speak up.  It's not my place to say who it is.  Oh, it could be.  I think I know who it is. 
[00:38:30]  But they had a relationship going into SiriusXM.  Oh, boy.  They didn't even meet at SiriusXM.  Oh, boy.  Or maybe they did.  I think they might have, actually.  I've got to remember this.  But they had to keep it very, very quiet, and they were scared.  Yeah.  They were absolutely scared that that could be a problem if anyone found out.  E-Rock comment?  I'm not saying it's E-Rock.  I know.  I'm not saying it's E-Rock.  I just want to comment.  I even love when pigs look at me, you know, sexually. 
[00:39:00]  It doesn't mean I want to bang them.  But if a two, like, I'm walking, you know, down the street and a two looks at me like  that, I'm a little lighter on my fucking steps.  I'm a little happier.  Can I call the police?  Can I call the police?  Right.  The guy on the phone, are you married?  Oh, wow.  Are you a married guy?  Are you in a relationship?  Oh, yes, I am in a relationship.  Okay, so, and you're a guy like I am, so do you, do you just go out, does your girl  let you go out and fuck other women? 
[00:39:30]  Ooh.  No, no, no, it's a fair question, because, and we all know this, human nature for a man  is to stick your dick in everything.  So, in your relationship, do you come home and go, hey, it's human nature, I can go out  and just fuck other girls?  Or have you adjusted and taken the human nature angle and said, yeah, tough shit, it's human  nature, I have to adjust because this is what I'm doing.  But you still want to.  Wanting is wanting, no one says you can't want.  Exactly.  It's behavior, it's not thoughts that are being part of.  But there are certain people that think that they can actually stop the want. 
[00:40:00]  You're absolutely right.  Jimmy is absolutely right.  Our human nature is to feel that attraction and try to find a way to procreate, if you  want to go down to the very base of our instincts.  Right.  And Jimmy is absolutely right.  And the point that I'm trying to make is that in the workplace, when you see an attractive  person, right, you're going, and you're available, or you've made yourself available, you know,  you want to talk to that person, you want to get to know that person, that's absolutely 
[00:40:30]  fine.  And that person, you know, is going to be able to say, yes or no, absolutely, you're  absolutely right.  Now, if someone's a fucking retard, and they hear the answer no, and they continue to pursue  it, then obviously, then obviously, there, there is a problem.  But, but the point, but, but the point that I think, uh, you know, uh, Anthony and, and, and 
[00:41:00]  Opie very eloquently put it, is that is that is that is that fucking brilliant where we  want to be.  You cannot, you cannot break human nature.  Right.  No, no, no, but nobody wants to break human nature.  But you can tame it, you can't break it, but you can tame it and live within the law.  Oh, yeah.  I think we all have common ground here.  I think where you're going with this is if you agree then that you cannot disrupt human nature, 
[00:41:30]  now I guess we have to have offices that are either all male or all male.  No, dude, how come?  It's the only way to solve your problem.  You're not, no.  It's the only way to fix it.  Sir, you're not.  My question was how do you override your human nature and remain monogamous to your girlfriend?  You've overridden human nature because your situation dictates that behaviorally you have to.  You're in a relationship.  I override it because I'm a human being and not an animal.  Okay, exactly.  We're not talking about people that you want to fuck the people you work with. 
[00:42:00]  You can't even just look at them sexually.  That's where this started.  But the excuse is being...  How can you not be attracted to them?  That's where this started.  No one cares if anyone's attracted.  No one's been punished for that.  It's a big leap to go with looking at someone sexually and actually having sex with them.  But it's about hitting on them or making them uncomfortable by being creepy.  It's not about being...  No one cares if you're attracted.  That's subjective, Jimmy.  That's subjective.  If I was Brad Pitt or someone who women generally found attractive, I could actually go to work 
[00:42:30]  and fucking do that every day.  Yeah, but we all have a certain commonality of behavior.  No, not necessarily.  Not necessarily.  Good-looking guys do get sued for sexual harassment.  A lot of times, it's probably better-looking guys that don't know how to handle no.  Like, it's usually...  I think uglier people are normally better at taking rejection and are more used to picking  up on shitty vibes.  It's the good-looking, powerful people a lot of times who don't understand that somebody  doesn't want to fuck them and they can't handle it.  Yeah.  I would... 
[00:43:00]  Not always, but I'm saying...  I would agree with you, but as long as advances are also accepted in the workplace, which they  are, right?  At times, sure.  As long as advances are still accepted in the workplace and everyone's not like Lexi, then  you're always going to...  This problem will always perpetuate itself.  So Lexi is being 100% legit.  She just goes to work and does her thing.  She's not saying anything wrong.  And she's probably...  No offense to Lexi, she's a special... 
[00:43:30]  Not a special case, but she was sexually abused as a child.  I would like to hear from a woman maybe that wasn't sexually abused as a child and how she  feels in the workplace.  Oh, then I bet she's like Samantha from Sex and the City.  Well, we went in the copy room.  I blew them.  I completely see why Lexi doesn't want, you know, guys looking at her in a sexual way  in general.  I wondered...  I don't want to say a normal or any of that shit, but a woman that wasn't  sexually abused if she agrees with Lexi. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  Just remember the staff, guys.  One in four girls.  So there's a lot of women out there like me.  But if you do look at a woman and you do her...  Damaged baggage.  I don't care if you guys look at me and say that I'm pretty or I'm sexy or I have a nice  body.  Just keep it to yourselves.  Look, admire, but don't act on it.  That's when the sexual harassment line gets crossed.  All right.  If I'm not inviting you to come talk to me, if I'm not inviting you, you know...  Oh, so it's up to you.  Yes!  Of course it is.  Of course it is.  Thank you very much. 
[00:44:30]  It's up to you.  It's up to you.  It's up to you.  It's up to you in the workplace.  Guys, that's a big deal at all times.  I get it.  All right, but the discussion didn't start where it is now.  Hey, frigid bitch.  I'm not talking about...  I'm not...  I was never talking about over-the-top flirting in the workplace, by the way.  Right.  I just wasn't.  That's great.  Thanks.  All right, buddy.  Thanks, William.  All right, you too.  Thanks, Lexi.  Why don't you just fucking get it over with?  Right?  Right, Lexi?  Human nature is not an excuse.  We all have it.  I get it.  I mean, I get it.  Believe me, I'm a pervert. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  I'm a fucking pervert, and I don't fuck with women here.  No.  You understand?  I'm one of the biggest perverts in this building.  I don't fuck with women.  You don't get shit on where you eat.  Damn it.  But we're not...  But that's not what we're really completely talking about.  Sure it is.  I don't even say hi to women in the hallway, because I'm scared that can lead to some dumb  thing.  I'm not trying to have sex with women around here.  I'm not.  But you can't even really have an interaction with people at work anymore, unless it's work 
[00:45:30]  related, because you never know what it's going to be that gets you into the HR office.  My point on this whole thing was the fact that women sometimes think that they're changing  the behavior and the mindset of men, and that when they walk into work and they're doing  their job, A1, just the greatest job ever, that they're being looked at and respected  as nothing more than a good worker. 
[00:46:00]  And that just ain't going to happen.  It's still an underlying bunch of bullshit to think that men aren't going to look at you  as a sexual being.  Now you'll get someone like Lexi that'll say, well, no, I know that's happening, but  there's no place for it at work.  But I honestly think that there are a lot of women that think it's not happening at all,  even behind the scenes.  Yeah, we pushed the discussion drastically forward.  I wasn't even talking about having sex or any of that shit. 
[00:46:30]  I mean, ladies, guys, when they go...  I'm talking about just normal interaction that men and women just happen to have during  the day.  And when guys hang out together, they are going to talk about your ass, ladies.  They're, you know, even at work.  You know, you look around, make sure there's no other girls, and then go, holy shit, did  you see whoever?  And that's why I didn't want to confuse it.  Of course, if you're being aggressive to a woman at work, that's wrong.  You can grab her by the arm and shake her a little.  Or just point at your dick and clear your throat. 
[00:47:00]  The story would subtle shit, like you can't say, oh, that dress looks nice on you today.  You can't even say that anymore.  Let's say hi to Rosie in Jersey.  Hi, I hope you can hear me.  I'm driving.  Hi, Rosie.  Hi, Rosie.  Hi, I agree with you, both you and Opie and Anthony, 100%.  Oh, thank you.  No, with what, though?  Because we kind of tackled a bunch of little things here today.  Well, as far as, you know, how women dress in the workplace, and especially when you're 
[00:47:30]  working, like, in an all-man field.  Yeah, that's cool.  No, men are men.  You can't control, you know, their thoughts.  Remember, the discussion started with women dressing sexy at work, but we're not allowed  to notice that.  That's where this started.  It went into a whole bunch of different places, obviously.  And when you hear about these sensitivity training things that go on at work, they aren't saying 
[00:48:00]  things like, hey, well, we know you want to fuck her, but keep it on the QT.  They're actually trying to get you to not even think about it, which is just a lie.  They're saying, like, you know, women shouldn't be looked at in this way, gentlemen.  She's just another co-worker.  And that's why everyone laughs at those fucking courses, because it's the utter bullshit of  the whole thing.  Because it's not human nature.  We all know not to fucking, for the most part, not to go grabbing ass and whipping your 
[00:48:30]  dick out.  We all fucking know this.  But we're still going to look at women as sexual beings.  You can look.  No one says don't think of her as sexual.  Don't touch!  But you're married.  Like, Sam, you're married.  Yeah.  Like, if your wife's at work, how do you want her treated?  Like, I've thought of that with my ex-girlfriend.  If they look at her sexually, whatever.  Absolutely.  I don't give a fuck.  No one cares.  Right.  Looking at my chick, too, fine.  But you don't...  There's a point where you don't want her to talk to a certain way.  Of course.  You don't want a guy coming over to a desk every day.  Right. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, but we're not even at that point.  No.  That's what...  That's the whole discussion.  We weren't going to that point.  Of course, there should be rules in place at workplace.  Yeah.  But it's this notion that you can't even, you know, like Ann said, think any sexual  divorce because a girl came in looking hot.  Right.  But, again, I'm a dirty guy, and I've talked to plenty of women here, and I'm  never afraid I'm going to get in trouble for sexual harassment.  Never.  Because I don't say anything stupid to them.  Well, we're also...  I mean...  Sorry, Jimmy.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.  No, no.  I don't do that because I just know, like, you can't do it, and it's fine. 
[00:49:30]  Human nature?  Fuck human nature.  I just don't do it.  But we're a little luckier, too, because of what we do.  It's a little more open-minded here.  Not much.  I talk to these chicks like they're fucking lawyers.  All of them.  Yes.  But I just nod to people around here because I don't know what people's switches are anymore.  And hearing all these horror stories, HR horror stories, I just nod.  I'm like, hi.  Yeah, but, General, if you talk to people like human beings, you're not going to get in trouble. 
[00:50:00]  People aren't getting in trouble for just being a human.  I talk to girls all the time.  Oh, boy.  That's...  Oh, do you?  Oh, really?  What do you say?  There are so many people out there that think they were talking to a woman just being a human being, and we could take an hour of phone calls that they got in trouble.  And the things they got in trouble for would blow your mind.  Because we've done this break.  Would blow your mind.  We've done this break.  Some things would.  You think you're talking like just a normal human being.  Yeah, yeah.  But some people are just genuinely dumb and don't know.  I'm not talking about those people.  That guy who called up a minute ago.  I'm talking about the average person that thinks he's going to work and just being a human being, and next thing you know, he's in human resources for the dumbest, stupid... 
[00:50:30]  We've taken these calls a million times.  If you want, we could take a few more today.  That guy who just called up, he's not a dumb guy.  And he made sense with what he said.  But, like, the way he was describing it, it's like human nature is not...  You take...  We all understand human nature.  Right.  It's a woman's human nature to want to give birth and to be protected and to be...  But when you're in work, you just got to act a certain way.  And we all get that. 
[00:51:00]  Right.  It is what it is.  And everybody knows that.  And it wouldn't be as strict if it hadn't been for companies ignoring things for so long and allowing it to go beyond.  And you hear those horror stories, and you're like, how the fuck did a company let this happen?  You could also argue the point that, you know, these women wanted to be part of the men's club there and get into the work environment that was predominantly male for so many years.  And...  They wanted to be treated...  And, again, I'm not Mr. Woman's right to believe me.  But people want to get in.  They shouldn't have to just take what's coming to them because they want to get the same treatment as other people. 
[00:51:30]  That's not fair, either.  Let's talk to a couple more women because we don't have the vaginas.  Nice.  DJ, a girl in Florida.  What's up, DJ?  Hey, good morning.  Good morning.  Hi, DJ.  So, here's the thing.  Good morning, you animal.  I am an animal.  You know what?  I am that book.  I'm 43.  Not 20 years old anymore.  But you know what?  I work in a completely female-dominated field.  I'm a nurse.  And you know what?  Yeah, I still want to be able to...  When I walk into work, it's okay if you're looking at me. 
[00:52:00]  It's fine.  You know what?  God does not give me this body for not to be looked at.  Whoa.  I don't mean...  Doesn't it...  I don't mean am I perfect.  I am not perfect.  You know, I'm heavier than I was when I was 20 and I was older.  I have a little more gray hair.  But you know what?  I can still bring it.  Fat old brood.  She says she can still bring it, though.  But...  You know what?  My point was simple when this started.  That just makes you feel good when someone looks at you sexually.  It does.  You know what? 
[00:52:30]  Look, I'm married.  But you know what?  I'm not gay.  You know what I mean?  Oh, boy.  And I can still appreciate a good-looking woman or a good-looking man.  You know, I'm not gay.  I'm straight.  But my point is that, you know what?  The industry, the perfume industry, the makeup industry, the clothing industry,  it's all targeted to say, hey, you know what?  You got to put them out there.  Hey.  Put it out there.  No, it's not...  You want to comment?  That's not...  But we've seen a drastic turn in advertising where they don't do the hot woman as much 
[00:53:00]  as they do the quote, I'll say it this way, hot guy.  Oh, yeah.  Like a hot guy with no clothes on is completely acceptable now in ads.  Give us an example, though.  But you do that shit with women, it's not accepted anymore.  But you know what?  That's because everybody's so freaking closed-minded.  Playtex just started running in Victoria's TV, you know, with the women, with their bras,  and they're showing the, you know, the Victoria's TV, the model thing that they do every year. 
[00:53:30]  You know what?  Because it's still taboo.  People still look at the body as a dirty thing and not as what it is.  It is the human body.  And Jimmy's right.  You know what?  Down to the cellular level, men need to do that.  They need to spread their seed.  I mean, it's just...  It's unfortunate.  Genetic.  That's exactly what it is.  But when it comes to the human nature discussion, any guy that's married and is faithful,  or in a relationship is faithful, human nature is that you're not faithful.  Human nature is that you're going to go out and fuck a lot of other women. 
[00:54:00]  And in marriages and relationships, if you found a way to be faithful, then you have understood  the difference between human nature and what works for this situation.  But sometimes it's just all you need is to know that you're still sexually attractive  to other women.  That makes you feel good, and that's all that you need to get you through the day.  But people, I think women like that, too.  I just think a lot of times at work, when they're trapped in a fucking room with someone  for eight hours, they don't want it. 
[00:54:30]  And if they are selective about who they want it from, yeah, I mean, that's the way the  world is.  Some people you like attention from, some you don't.  The workplace just sucks.  They've taken away all the little things that would help you get through the day.  It just sucks now.  Well, stuff like the calendars and a joke, that's where companies have gotten ridiculous.  That's where it's gotten nonsensical.  The flags, how about, we're not even talking about just the sexual stuff.  Baby pictures.  Yeah, baby pictures.  Yes, that's what I'm trying to tell you.  Some women, they're barren, and their wounds are busted. 
[00:55:00]  Some women can't have children.  We've had this call a few times over the years.  Makes them sad.  So, you know, they go to HR and go, you know, Susie over there with that picture with her  kids, that kind of makes me sad every day.  So next thing you know, they make a rule, you can't even have family pictures in your  cubicles.  They should have no barren rules.  We're losing our fucking minds.  Well, that's where companies are stupid.  It's ridiculous.  No balance.  Yeah.  There's no balance.  I don't believe in the company anymore. 
[00:55:30]  And I mean that just, you know, that's a sweeping statement.  Hawaiian Shirt Fridays are pretty fun, though, right?  Right.  I've got to admit.  I'm not talking about this particular company.  I'm talking about all companies.  I don't believe in the company at all.  They will not protect you in the end.  They will just, they will fuck you in the end.  There was a time they would protect radio guys and everybody else, but not anymore, man.  Too many lawsuits and shit, I think.  Yeah.  A big part of it.  But the lawsuits were brought on by, simply by, and again, I know that there's out of 
[00:56:00]  whack responses to innocent moments, but that's not what the lawsuits were.  And when you, you know, you read some of these cases, you're like, if this is the truth,  how the fuck did any rational company think this was not going to bite them?  Yeah.  Yeah.  This guy does this every day and you leave him there.  People are obsessed with Jimmy with the creepy guy at the gym.  Oh, okay.  Jordan, I'll log out.  Go ahead.  Hey, guys.  How's it going?  Hey, Jordan.  Hey.  First of all, my point completely changed from when I started out on hold.  There's a guy in my gym, first of all, who I nicknamed Looky Lou because he just cannot 
[00:56:30]  keep his eyes to himself.  And of course, he's six foot four with a giant mustache.  If he was wearing like a trench coat, it would be even more appropriate than sauna.  But, but the better part actually is recently I went and bought a car and I had a female  sales, uh, salesperson and she was purposely reaching across my lap to show me the features  on the steering wheel, bending up where she was wearing Look.  Sort of the dick shift.  Yeah.  She's selling you something. 
[00:57:00]  She's smart.  Mm-hmm.  But, Jim, I kind of tell you.  Well, she's using her sexuality to her advantage there, right?  Sure.  Totally distasteful because my feeling was like, it's one thing if I'm in a bar and I'm hoping  that she's going to reach across my junk and, and, and point something out.  That's great.  But if, if that was a man.  This is a shanker.  It's a VD joke.  Without the joke part.  A pesky joke part.  Was she, was she pretty?  Oh, well, I mean, probably 15 years ago, maybe. 
[00:57:30]  Okay.  But my point is, even if she's a pig and she does that move, I'm, I'm, I'm sitting there  going, all right, man, that's kind of cool.  Doesn't mean I want to have sex with the broad.  I got to tell you, it wasn't cool.  I'll tell you why.  Because my whole, the whole time she's doing this, I'm saying to myself, if this was my  girlfriend who was sitting there and it was a guy reaching across, I'm going to put,  I'm going to put five across his lip.  I'm not sure.  Whoa.  Your whole cock? 
[00:58:00]  Put five across his lip.  My God.  Get that on a shirt.  Go ahead, sir.  Sorry.  They're saying you have a small penis.  Five's small, right?  I was saying huge.  Five's big.  Well, you hope she's doing all right, then.  Where are we?  Jordan?  All right, Jordan.  Did that want to annoy you if a guy did it to your chick?  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  Yeah.  This one's for you, all right? 
[00:58:30]  There you go.  Thanks, buddy.  Wow.  Well, I don't think we got anything accomplished here.  Well, you know, we threw it out there, huh?  Throw it against the wall.  With sticks.  This guy says in the 80s he almost got fired for sexual harassment, and he wasn't even  talking to the girl.  These are kind of the phone calls.  He was jacking off on her.  Yeah, exactly.  She couldn't.  She was duct taped.  What happened, sir?  We advanced the discussion forward, obviously, but I really was trying to keep it more in  that subtle vein.  Yeah. 
[00:59:00]  And maybe Bill has something on that.  Bill, go ahead.  Yeah, back in like 86, 87, I was working at a factory, and we had a girl that worked  down there, and she was a good-looking girl, but she had gone out with probably 10 or 12  guys that I had there with two of you.  A whore.  Exactly.  So this other guy comes up to me, and he says, hey, if you got a chance, he said, would  you hit that?  I said, no.  She's been with too many guys.  I don't have no interest in that.  And the next day, I got called into HR, and they said that I said that I wouldn't fuck  her because everybody in the planet fucked her. 
[00:59:30]  And I got, I mean, it went on for like a week.  I had to deny, deny, deny, almost.  I mean, they were ready to fire me.  Wait, how did they know?  Yeah.  How did they know?  That guy, either he told her, but I never did find out exactly how they knew.  Either that guy went and told that girl that I said that I wouldn't fuck her because  she fucked everybody, or he went straight to HR, which I believe went to the girl.  I think he went to the girl because he was trying to get in her pants.  And he thought he was trying to, you know, make his mark with him.  Did you kill him?  Yeah.  She killed him. 
[01:00:00]  That's the problem.  But he may have went to her and lied because he's trying to fuck her and said that you  were saying something worse and just gratuitously starting rumors about her.  And then she, yeah, I mean, so basically somebody lied about you, but that's not a good example.  People lie.  I could lie and say that somebody here is stealing and they'd have to call them into HR.  Yeah, but that's how nervous HR was about it.  I didn't even say it.  And they were, I mean, they didn't even want to hear my side of the story.  They just automatically knew that, yeah, I said that, let's fire him.  So you got fired?  No, I never did. 
[01:00:30]  I actually eventually did for fighting.  I beat a guy's ass.  How'd you not get fired?  How'd you not get fired?  I just denied, denied, denied.  I just kept denying it.  I said, nope.  I said, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.  And they didn't have any proof that I said it.  Right.  And I never did say that.  So you were accused of something, they took it seriously, and then you were able to prove  your case?  Yeah.  You proved your case by denying it and you weren't fired.  That's a horrible example, sir.  Outrageous.  That's what happened.  Yeah, but again, they had to ask you about it. 
[01:01:00]  You denied it.  And maybe they were too overzealous about it, but they didn't fire you.  Yeah, but that was back in the 80s, too, when you could still pinch ass.  What he's talking about is, that's a nice little joke.  That was nice back then in those days.  Say things.  Ron in Buffalo could explain why companies react the way they do.  Go ahead, Ron.  Hi, Ron.  Hey, guys.  I was just going to call and talk about how Jimmy is making the point with married guys  not acting on it. 
[01:01:30]  And the whole thing with it being companies getting in trouble with the gray areas.  And, you know, you're pointing out, hey, you never would go ahead and cheat on your  wife or whoever, but guys still look at porn, guys still give a sideways glance to people  that walk by, girls that walk by on the street.  Yes.  Well, that's the kind of stuff in the office where you really get in trouble.  And in a relationship.  And in a relationship sometimes.  There's a penalty for those things in a relationship.  Absolutely.  I'm allowed to look at a woman on the fucking street without having to worry about it.  Okay, are you allowed to flirt text? 
[01:02:00]  I don't want to flirt text.  That's the thing you want to.  But are you allowed to flirt text with a girl?  Like, yeah, that's ambiguous.  It's kind of.  Or would you get in trouble for that?  We haven't.  I don't even know because it doesn't come up.  It's something I don't want to do.  I would get in trouble.  I've gotten in trouble.  Everyone knows.  Of course you'd get in trouble.  Well, why are you flirt texting?  It's something I just don't want to do.  So it's never come up in our relationship.  It's human nature for me to want to flirt with girls because even though I'm not going to hook up with them, I want to feel attractive.  Right.  And the more you flirt, the more you're like, oh, this chick really isn't to me. 
[01:02:30]  But yeah, but that's the gray area.  You're not cheating and you're not saying anything overly, but you're flirting a little bit.  You'd get in trouble.  I did get in trouble.  Your wife would go like, what are you doing?  Oh, man.  All of us would get in trouble.  This has never come up in my relationship.  But you know the answer to that.  Not necessarily.  Okay.  Not necessarily.  That's the area where this is like a gray area.  The way the gray area exists is why companies react the way they do.  It goes back to, you know, obviously the laws were first written because people are grabbing ass and, you know, doing ridiculous, you know, hang your dick out, whatever. 
[01:03:00]  But when they wrote the law, as always, you know, the lawyers screwed up and left something that's completely open to interpretation.  You know, the company I work for, we go through extensive sexual harassment training.  And the phrase that's in the law is that you cannot create a hostile work environment.  Oh, boy.  What happens there is lawyers interpret that, and that's where you get all this bullshit stuff.  Yeah, because it's kind of vague, you know.  What makes it hostile, right?  It's kind of like the FCC, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  A little vague.  They're always vague.  I mean, there's a lot of gray area there. 
[01:03:30]  Sexual harassment, the first inkling I ever got about it when I heard about it when I was, like, a kid was, here's the boss, the all-powerful boss in the office telling a woman that he wants to do stuff to her to guarantee her advancement.  That's where it comes from.  Right.  How it worked out to you can't hang a flag in your cubicle or put pictures of your kids in there is ludicrous.  It's ludicrous.  Yeah.  Of course it is. 
[01:04:00]  It's ludicrous.  Or you can't play ludicrous.  Thank you, sir.  It's totally fucked up and ironic.  Let's go to Mike in L.A.  Mmm.  Mike.  Michael.  Yo!  I was talking about Jimmy, uh, Jimmy with the guy in the gym.  I mean, if that was a hot training, he'd be happy with it.  But because it's a creepy guy, it's all, it's the subjectivity of it.  Like you said, it's too much gray area, and they're trying to legislate the gray area out.  I certainly don't want a creepy guy looking at me in that way, but I don't look at it as being vile. 
[01:04:30]  I just kind of laugh.  It just makes me laugh.  It is what it is.  I mean, old dust-cut Lexi, yeah, she's probably not laying.  Oh, Jesus.  He gets upset, but, you know, if the dude's kind of, if she finds the dude attractive,  then she's obviously going to accept more of the flirtation.  Okay, let me ask you a question.  The point I was making, dude, the point I was making was that I finally, I got how it felt  to be looked at in an unwanted way, and it bothered me.  Like, that's what the point I was making.  Not if he was a good-looking chick or a tranny or whatever it is. 
[01:05:00]  So let's just say you're at work.  Whatever kind of work you do, how do you, and I mean, for real, how would you feel if your  boss, every time he called you into the office was just staring at your cock?  And I get, like, yeah, once or twice, ah, what the hell.  You're going to tell me that wouldn't want to make you pick up a glass ashtray and smash  his fucking face?  Well, first off, I mean, it's a little flattering, like, cock, but in all honesty, if it's that  huge of a deal, that's your boss, that's different from a position of, well, if I don't, like  Anthony said, with the, if you advance through the sexual harassment from your boss, that's 
[01:05:30]  a little different.  But co-workers...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, hold on.  You want to be a sexual being.  You want to be looked at by certain people as a sexual creature.  So you're fine.  Not in a joke way.  Everybody does.  You lost all the weight, Jimmy, so you could be viewed better.  Point out, of course, dude, but I'm saying, at work, are you telling me, it wouldn't bother  you if every time you walked in, your male boss was flirting with you a little bit, and  you knew he was, and it wasn't a joke, he was for real flirting with you, you'd be fine 
[01:06:00]  with that.  Boss or co-worker?  Either or.  I'd be able to handle it.  You'd be able to handle it, but you'd hate it.  Imagine day after day, right?  Day after day, it's for real.  We're joking, but let's say Gary, Kate, or whoever it was, or Blatt, or Mel, whoever you  want to say, and flirted with you, and they weren't joking.  They weren't being funny, and it was like a really weird, creepy, like, flirty thing.  You would want to fucking smash them.  Would I be able to keep my job without blowing them? 
[01:06:30]  Because then I'd be fine with that.  And does it mean I get a nice, huge raise?  Yeah, I'd be all right with that.  But if he moved it to the next where, you've got to blow me or I'm firing you tomorrow,  then of course not.  Okay, so...  I wouldn't be happy about it, but I'd be able to handle it, I guess.  But it would creep you out.  I'd be able to handle it.  You wouldn't like it, though.  It would creep you out.  You'd be like, this is fucking annoying and awful, and this guy is saying things like  you complimented your body every time you walked in, and he wasn't joking. 
[01:07:00]  Dude, you look great in those jeans.  This fucking gym is starting to work out for myself.  There is a line between going in as a little victim and taking it every day and going to  some agency that the company has set up.  You walk up to him and go, hey, knock the fuck off.  How about you handle things like human beings in this day and age?  I like that.  I would never feel like a victim, that's for sure.  Never.  Yeah.  And you say something then.  Okay.  Yeah.  But you know the point I'm making?  You'd hate the way it feels.  You would hate it.  I know I would hate that.  If a guy, for real, a creepy one of the bosses was fucking... 
[01:07:30]  Or even a co-worker was flirting with me and like, you know, and not being funny.  Again, our environment, like you said, is a little weird, too.  Of course.  We're hard to shock.  If you say to no interest and ask them to back off and they don't, then you have an  issue.  But if it's just a casual flirt or something, you might say something or lead to something  back.  And it's completely different.  Like Ope said, guys want to fuck anything.  If a hog tells you you're sexy, yeah, I don't want to fuck her.  It makes you feel good for that moment.  Okay.  And of course there should be rules in place. 
[01:08:00]  If it was a zero or a hog, I'd go fuck the hog.  But women are so different about that.  Oh, he's ugly.  I don't like him.  That's harassment.  Oh, I fuck him.  That's why he's flirting with me.  And I'm not saying throw all the rules out the window.  Like if a male co-worker is flirting with you and you fucking say, look, knock it off.  And you know, it's just, it's not my thing, whatever.  And he continues.  Then of course you got to do something about it.  That's right.  Of course.  So, sir, you're saying.  We're not fucking cavemen here.  You don't mind if your male co-worker or your male boss was just, because you have the same 
[01:08:30]  thing I do.  Like I like to be looked at by certain people.  Other people know.  If they stare at me every day, whatever.  I don't give a fuck.  Okay.  You don't.  But the most.  I don't give a fuck.  All right.  Well, if he's flirting with me, then I would absolutely say something.  And then if that doesn't go anywhere, then maybe I would have to deal with it.  But if he was staring at you, that would get like.  I don't give a fuck.  Okay.  I really don't.  I don't believe you, but I think that would drive you crazy.  It wouldn't drive me crazy.  I'd be creeped out and stuff.  Right.  Exactly.  But I wouldn't give a fuck enough to go down to HR or any of that is what I'm saying. 
[01:09:00]  Because you just know when you walk out the door, you're going to have to deal with  shit every day.  But do you want to work eight hours or four hours a day, whatever it is, being creeped out?  It wouldn't be.  We do.  Look who I sit next to.  But you know what I'm saying, though?  How many times have you went, ooh?  But you know what I'm saying, though.  If it's for real, it wouldn't bother me.  But I'd be able to just handle it.  It's, I guess, my point.  You know, there's so many things you've got to deal with as soon as you leave the house.  I'm already dictating to everybody else. 
[01:09:30]  It's not going to ruin my day or any of that crap.  It wouldn't.  But it would ruin my day if some guy was creepily fucking leering at me at work.  Like, for real.  It would ruin my day if it happened day in and day out.  Would you go to HR?  Because that's the point here, I guess.  Because, like I said, we all deal with shit.  There's people around here that, as soon as I see their face, it gets me annoyed.  But it doesn't ruin my day.  As a guy, it's hard because I haven't had to deal with that.  So I don't know if I'd go to HR.  But if a guy was coming up to me every day and being flirty and being like, and it was a guy I didn't like or a guy I wasn't friends with or wasn't comfortable with, and I knew what he was doing, I might say something to him. 
[01:10:00]  Or I might go to Gary or to Steve and go, what the fuck is this guy doing every day coming up here?  Or, like, how annoying is it when we're doing radio and you have to look out there?  Hold on, sir.  Hold on.  When you're looking out that window and a guy walks up and throws a look in here.  No, no.  It bothers me until I don't see him anymore.  But it bothers you.  It bothers me.  It bothers all of us.  But then I don't think about it anymore.  But if it happens, because he's gone. 
[01:10:30]  I feel a sense of pride that I could also, you know, handle myself in these situations.  That I don't need a stupid HR department to fucking fight my battles.  I would handle it myself.  I would fucking say, look, enough.  Stop.  What are you doing?  But you would say something.  Okay, you would say you would have that moment where you said something because it bothered you.  I would handle my own shit.  Yeah.  What if it didn't stop?  I don't know.  I have no idea.  At that point.  You know what I'm saying?  That's because if you handle it that way.  I certainly would avoid the person at work and all that shit.  But companies also allow relationships in the office, whether there's rules or not. 
[01:11:00]  I work for a company that's doing it right now.  But we get an honor code deal where you can't date employees, yet we allow it, too.  So, I mean, it's so much subjectivity.  Well, we're going to do this.  As long as a chick's feelings aren't hurt, there will be no issues.  But when the girl's feelings get hurt, now everybody's in trouble.  All right, Mike.  You know, like I said many times during the discussion,  we've pushed this discussion way further than where we started. 
[01:11:30]  Yeah.  Like, here's another guy.  The company tells them what cell phone ringtones they're allowed to use.  Like, why is that a problem?  They got one from my app that went,  Pick up the phone, cunt!  Pick up the phone, cunt!  Let's see what happens.  Let's see what this is about.  Mike, what are you talking about with ringtones?  What's the problem with ringtones at your work?  What's going on, boys?  Or just say that.  Steve Miller, the Joker, that was inappropriate.  So I switched to the Fat Bottom Girls.  That was inappropriate. 
[01:12:00]  You know.  Wait, why is it?  Well, hold on, hold on.  First of all, Steve Miller, the Joker.  Why would that be a problem as a ringtone?  Because it stinks.  Yeah.  Oh, Midnight Joker?  Midnight Joker, a little drug use.  Oh, wow.  I don't know.  Yeah, I didn't have any problems with it.  No, why did they find it a problem?  It's a pretty innocent song, except for the token line.  If you peaches want to shake your tree, might not be like that.  I don't know.  Peaches, they're probably tits, right?  So they actually told you what ringtones you could have?  Well, they were saying that if I don't personally change the ringtone, I might have to be brought 
[01:12:30]  down to HR and explained business etiquette.  This phone's going, the house next door to me was sold.  Yeah, well, you can see where that, that's my point, though.  It's like, okay, sure, some of these ringtones could be a problem, but it's the dumb ones  like the Joker by Steve Miller?  Ridiculous.  And the other thing we've got to add to this discussion before we take a break, a lot of 
[01:13:00]  this shit comes from middle management just being power-hungry douchebags, too.  Justifying their job.  We all know that.  That's the point.  That's the point.  The old days, your manager used to come up to you or whoever it was, your co-worker,  say, listen, this is what's going on.  Do me a favor and get rid of it.  Now, the big HR hanging over your head.  Everything you do, HR, HR, HR.  So, you know, it's getting crazy.  Here's a guy.  Well, thank you, sir.  Let me go to Nick in Ohio.  We're trying to go to break, but there's some good calls coming in.  Go ahead, Nick. 
[01:13:30]  Hi, what's up, guys?  Hi, Nick.  So, I worked this shitty-ass fucking security gig for UPS about six years ago, and I had  a supervisor, and the guy, he was gayer than fucking Paris.  I mean, it was obvious, but I never said anything.  Wait, I've never heard that one before.  Gayer than fucking Paris?  No one's ever said it before.  Gayer than Paris.  Gay Paris.  Oh, I like that.  It's pretty funny.  All right, go ahead, man.  Anyways, man, so I let that shit fly. 
[01:14:00]  I mean, I didn't like it.  I didn't feel comfortable, but whatever.  After about two months, the shit kind of started to escalate, and I could see the dude  was trying, kind of flirting, but he wasn't saying anything directly.  I had a bad day.  I came into work.  I wasn't going to fucking take it.  I finally told him, I said, hey, man, enough of the gay shit.  I said, I can see what you're doing, blah, blah, blah.  This fucker went and turned it around, went straight up to HR, filed a report basically  saying it was harassment, that I was harassing him for being gay before I could actually 
[01:14:30]  go and, you know, say something myself, so whatever.  Oh, okay.  So he probably cut you off by doing that.  That was, what's the word?  When you strike first.  Preemptive.  Preemptive.  Right, yes.  Well, we all know we're all supposed to accept the gay now.  You're not allowed to be against the gay, which is ridiculous.  I'm not against the gay, but I think people, if they're against the gay, should be able  to express that. 
[01:15:00]  I don't know why we all have to be accepting of that.  Through hatred and...  No, I don't mean it.  No, I'm kidding.  Once again, there's things, of course, that are completely unacceptable, but you're not  even allowed to express that you're uncomfortable with the gay lifestyle or whatever.  That will get you in a shitload of trouble.  I'm not talking about, you know, violence or any of that crap.  Yeah.  Mine's for an HR lady.  Ugh, Christ. 
[01:15:30]  Hope she's in an accident right now as she calls.  Hi, Tiffany.  Who works for HR.  Tiffany.  Hi, guys.  I love you guys so much.  All right.  Whatever.  Sorry about my last comment.  I don't like anyone that works in HR.  Really, I guess I feel defensive, but it is annoying.  It is annoying.  It's very tough to run a business these days.  The laws are very hard to enforce, but I will tell you, you know, of all of the claims that  I get, most of them are bullshit. 
[01:16:00]  Most of them we don't act on.  We don't discipline employees.  You guys may just hear about the more sensational stories.  You know, like you said, if a guy pulls his dick out in a cubicle, yeah, you're probably  going to hear about that.  But the average claim I get is, you know, a chick saying, hey, my boss sent me a text  message and I'm uncomfortable with it.  And then when I investigate, I found out that she actually texted back.  And that's usually how it goes.  So I love my job.  It's really entertaining.  The laws are in place for a reason, just like Jimmy's comment, because there was, you 
[01:16:30]  know, there were atrocities in previous times and we're trying to regulate the workforce  and blah, blah, blah.  But if you look at the law, it talks about what is reasonable.  And, you know, I've been through cases where there's juries and when the juries have to  make a decision, the judge says, make a decision based on what is reasonable to the average  person.  And the law also talks about if it's unwelcome or not.  So even the law recognizes if it's welcome, it might just be okay. 
[01:17:00]  What about no means yes?  That's the rule I like to adhere to.  Is it bad to have that tattooed on your forehead?  Yeah, like what's unwelcome and what's welcome, that's a big, a big topic.  Well, at my house, we all know that.  And if you think about workplace romances, they always... 
[01:17:30]  Are you Sam Roberts?  They start off well, but then they usually end not so well.  Yeah, with the boyfriend coming in with fatigues on and a guitar case.  That's not well, yes.  What starts off as, you know, romance and good times, then all of a sudden it's unwelcome.  You know, and then if you have, you know, two co-workers that are, you know, having a thing  and then one of them gets promoted, then all of a sudden it's a different context and the  law changes.  I saw a rom-com like that. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, that's every rom-com, sorry.  Forgot.  Yeah, or if one starts fucking somebody else at work and it just becomes a whole thing  and no boss wants to deal with that.  That doesn't, it never works out well, yeah.  Dude, I look at it like this, I'm a hunk of shit, like I am a pervert.  And I've never had to talk to HR here.  And again, I know our environment is much different being radio guys.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But out there in the office, it's not that much different.  And I've interacted with enough people, and I've talked to enough people, and I've waved  at enough people, and I see hello, and I've never once had an issue. 
[01:18:30]  So if I can survive in a pseudo-work environment, then the average guy who's not a complete bag  of filth can too.  Well, but they're not surviving.  Maybe we just have a different situation here, and we're a little luckier than the average  worker.  How about this too?  Let's go back in time again.  And let's think before, cell phones and social media, you're at work.  Can we go back to the late 60s?  Yeah, I love going back there.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:19:00]  Because there's no cell phones back there.  Let's just go back.  I want it to be a little groovy.  Now, Jimmy, you say you never had a problem.  You know when you're walking the halls and stuff.  But how much time, really, in a given work day, are you actually back there?  Right.  Imagine, eight hours a day, you're in a cubicle environment.  No social media, no real way to meet people, girls especially, for relationships and stuff.  That type of environment was really kind of in place to socialize. 
[01:19:30]  You socialized more at work back then, talking to people.  And you couldn't just go home and text a picture to somebody or your feelings like that.  So you talked more at work.  There's eight hours of your day where you're interacting with people of the opposite sex.  Maybe you're interested in one.  So you put the feelers out there to see if they're interested.  Now, that alone is looked at as a violation. 
[01:20:00]  Even putting your feelers out there to see if someone might be up to going out on a date with you and stuff,  that is taboo in the workplace.  That's a good point about I don't have to be eight hours.  I mean, that's very true.  And I get to say what I want.  I can email pictures.  Right.  We have a different situation.  Most of our work day, it's just us.  Right.  I mean, we interact with people when we go during the breaks.  That's a total of maybe 20 minutes a day.  Yeah, not even.  You're right.  But the thing is, you say you put out feelers.  Part of the problem is, A, that most guys or people are dumb and push it beyond where it's wanted. 
[01:20:30]  Not all, but a lot of people don't take a hint.  And they can't take when someone's not interested in them.  And we all know a million people like that.  Oh, sure.  It's obvious to everyone she's not interested.  And it's also at work now because, again, it's not just sexual harassment.  The violent stuff that's happened at work over relationships, it just can't happen anymore.  Because too many people have been shot.  Too many people have had explosive fucking situations. 
[01:21:00]  The girl's scared to come to work because the fucking guy is just, you know, the employers don't want to deal with that shit.  Yeah, yeah.  So I know it's easy for me to say because I don't have to deal with it.  But you just can't do it at work.  Work somewhere with a fucking hot chick.  Find someone outside of work is the point of that.  You have to.  Yeah.  I think that would be insane to the individual.  You go to work and you're naturally attracted to someone and want to date them and possibly marry them.  And you can't say a word.  That's crazy.  Unrequited love.  Ah, the heartbreak.  Yes, yes, indeed.  Guy goes, I work with a guy who wears mascara at work. 
[01:21:30]  And how do I address that?  With a heart on.  See, whatever.  That stuff is, that's the whatever stuff.  That wouldn't bother me.  Who cares?  Yeah.  Who gives a fuck?  Mm-hmm.  Sera.  Sexy.  Well, I think we're going to get some answers from our pal who's no longer with us.  It's almost been two years, right?  Patrice?  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Oh, my God.  He did a whole bit on sexual harassment.  He did, yes. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  So I think it'll wrap up this whole hour and a half nicely.  Nice little package.  Dude, it's almost two fucking years.  Two years, right around this time.  I didn't realize it was the anniversary that was coming up.  Time to grow the beard again.  Fuck, man.  For my pal, Patrice O'Neal.  Damn, man.  You got that, Iraq?  Yes, I do.  All right, we're going to do that.  We got one of our favorite people coming in today.  I can't wait for Ian Halpern.  Oh, man.  I can't wait.  It's been way too long.  He hasn't been on the show in quite a while, but he makes enough of an impact that a lot of  people remember who he is, of course. 
[01:22:30]  Yes, yes.  Ian Halpern.  His Highness.  His Highness Hollywood.  His Highness Hollywood, Ian Halpern.  Back to the show.  In studio for the first time in probably at least two years.  Google it.  Yeah.  It might be the first time since he brought in the dude with the fake French accent.  Oh, remember that guy?  What a character.  I forgot about that guy.  And maybe some Jocktober.  As Jocktober comes to an end in another day or two.  Oh, man.  That's it.  Hey, what's with the Scott and Todd interview in Tyson?  Did you see that?  Did anybody see that? 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  People keep tweeting.  It kind of went viral, too, man.  Why?  TMZ picked it up for whatever reason.  I got a fist on my face.  I got a tattoo on my cheek.  I can't even feel my own nose.  Oh, Tyson punched you in the face.  How did that feel, Scott?  I can't even feel my own nose.  Oh, my God.  Is that the guy Chris Brown punched?  Oh, no.  That's, yeah.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:23:30]  Hey, what did you think about Amistad?  I want to see the boat movie.  Oh, that's good.  We might do a little Scott and Todd today, I think.  No, not today.  Tomorrow?  Well, what day is today?  Today is Wednesday the 30th.  I was planning on doing Scott and Todd today.  Yeah.  But yesterday, when they had Tyson in the studio and everything, Todd wasn't even there.  Whoa.  They didn't say he wasn't there, and they still did a phone scam as if he was.  Oh.  But he wasn't.  All right, so we'll do something else today? 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, I got another show today.  And we got to continue with the people we were doing yesterday, and it turns out the broad's  a fan of ours.  Oh.  And she tweeted about Jacktober.  Yeah.  She wrote something like, I've been laughing my ass off all month about Jacktober.  Oh, no.  And then something like, Karma's a bitch.  Oh, guys.  I forgot the exact tweet.  We'll find it after the break.  We weren't that mean to them yesterday, though, because they weren't nearly as bad as other  shows.  Yeah, we almost said how hot she was.  Yeah, she was cute. 
[01:24:30]  Yeah.  You can't laugh at her.  In some photos, she's almost hot.  You know, that's a compliment.  Yeah.  And you can't laugh at Jacktober and then do fake radio bits and then expect not to, you  know.  Oh, God.  Well, Sam, have a heart.  Yeah.  Be a person.  I mean, to the broadcasters that want to take us seriously this month.  Just stop with the nonsense.  That's all.  You don't need to do the fake phone calls.  You know, do something else with that time.  Yeah.  It's pretty obvious now.  I can't do the phony phone calls anymore. 
[01:25:00]  They're not legal.  Wait to hear today's show.  Oh, no.  All right.  We'll do that next, I guess.  But first, Patrice O'Neill wrapping up everything we were talking about with sexual harassment.  Like, ladies, let's discuss, look, let's discuss harassment for a second.  Let's just see.  You feel it a little bit?  Like, let's just discuss it.  Why can't I harass you? 
[01:25:30]  Sometimes, sometimes.  I can never harass you.  Never.  And I'm not talking about, like, I'm talking just at the job.  It's unfair that I can't harass you at the workplace. 
[01:26:00]  Like, you're looking how you're looking, and I can't just, a little something that has to do.  Like, you've got to be careful just to say, hey, you look beautiful today.  That's how messed up the game is.  I think you should be able to comment on any part of the body that you see.  If you, I'm serious.  What's your name? 
[01:26:30]  What's your name?  Jeannie.  Now, Jeannie, no disrespect, but if I work with you, I should be able to walk in and go, oh, Jeannie, beautiful titty meat you have there.  And, because I see that, but whatever the scientific term is, I'm looking at Mr., a 4.9 grade point average.  What's the, what's the science term for the titty meat? 
[01:27:00]  What's the actual, and it's not the cleavage.  I mean, the cleavage is the space in the middle.  I'm talking about the meat, the meat, the titty part.  And I'm not being foul, just, you know, whoa.  You know what I'm saying?  Just so I can go through the rest of the day without pretending that I don't see. 
[01:27:30]  What's, what's, you understand what I'm saying?  I mean, let's work out a deal.  Don't get me fired.  Having women work with men, right, is like having a grizzly bear work with salmon.  Dipped in honey, like, so, now you dip the salmon in the honey, right, grizzly bears, and the salmon get to walk through comfortable with honey and fish and, good morning, grizzly bears. 
[01:28:00]  And the grizzly bears is like, hey, he can't even, he can't even growl, like, ah, what's up, fish?  Oh, my God, human resources.  The grizzly bear just did grizzly bears.  So, so, like, I can't even go, hey, good morning, good morning, fish, good morning. 
[01:28:30]  Oh, I can't touch it, like, oh, look at that.  Oh, let me just get a little bit of that fish, a little bit.  Let me get that honey.  Oh, my God.  Fish and honey, man, that's my favorite.  Usually I kill fish and eat them and stuff, but I just wanted to just rub that, rub a little bit of that. 
[01:29:00]  God damn.  That's oppressive.  Like, you shouldn't even, and there's cameras everywhere.  You can't do, like, weird stuff behind the back, like.  Why would it be disrespectful if I said, what's your name?  Terrell.  If I go, hey, Terrell, we work together.  And I go, Terrell, hey, do me a favor.  Let me know when you're getting up to go to the bathroom so I can sniff your chair. 
[01:29:30]  That's disrespectful because it's sexual, but that keeps me from being, like, I think, look, I think there should be a holiday, for lack of a better word, harassment day, but not, that sounds whatever.  But I mean a day where I get to find out, like, because, and this is why it should be harassment day, because women get to be inappropriate sexually all the time. 
[01:30:00]  You get to be inappropriate.  And when I say inappropriate, I mean say hello to me too close.  Or some weird massage, because you think we're friends, and you say, good morning, and a little kiss. 
[01:30:30]  And he's just like, oh, oh, boy, oh, boy, boy, boy, boy.  And you think in your head, man, I wonder if I, I wonder if I, you know.  Well, harassment day allows you to be able to ask all year, I say the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. 
[01:31:00]  And it's, and it's a beautiful day, flowers and everything.  You buy a flowers, you're just real cool, you walk up, you're respectful, you say, hey, how are you?  Oh, you know, good afternoon to her, happy harassment day.  And you just, like, say, listen, I was wondering all year if you would suck my dick in the broom pile.  And you'd just be like, no, thank you, I'm not, and you'd be like, I'm just, thank you, keep the flowers. 
[01:31:30]  I just thought, I made a mistake.  I thought you was a hoe all year.  I was confused.  I thought you was a hoe, but you're not.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Continues.  Want to wish our pal, Kevin Pollack, a very happy birthday today. 
[01:32:00]  I know he's listening.  Really?  Listens every day, yep.  Happy birthday, Kevin.  Does he share a birthday with Henry Winkler?  He sure does.  Oh.  The Fonz is 68 today.  68 for the Fonz, huh?  It's been a while.  We've got to get the Fonz back in here.  Gee, get your reverse mortgage.  We had Richie Cunningham last week.  We've got to get the Fonz back.  Definitely dead. 
[01:32:30]  Oh, I know.  Oh, okay.  Orson Welles, because, uh...  Oh, the Halloween broadcast?  The War of the Worlds aired 75 years ago, today.  Find me a jury.  Crisp crumb coating.  Crisp crumb coating.  It doesn't roll off the tongue.  Crisp crumb coating.  And we've got the Red Sox winning the World Series tonight.  Oh, boy.  That's right.  Guaranteed.  It is a guarantee.  Absolutely.  It's a lock.  I picked this one. 
[01:33:00]  It's going to be my first good pick in many, many years.  Your gunshot's all over Boston right now.  It's my first good pick in many years.  Yeah.  I think I finally picked the winner.  Is this the first time they can win at home?  Since 1918.  Wow.  1918.  I remember that.  How happy will people be?  If they lose there, how bad will that be?  I hope they run on the field.  Go old school.  That would be great.  Rip down the green monster.  All that shit should happen tonight if they clinch it home.  There's no way they could lose. 
[01:33:30]  It's a lock.  It's totally a lock.  Everyone knows it.  Yeah.  Everyone knows it.  Yeah.  Shut up.  No, don't worry.  I got this one.  I got this one this time.  I hope he's got it.  I got it.  Yeah.  I finally figured out my sports curse.  It's good.  We're good.  The best part is it's not a bit because Opie really wants them to win.  He's a fan.  Yeah.  Well, I wouldn't say I'm a fan, but between the two teams, yes, I would pick the Red Sox  over the Cardinals every single time.  Yeah.  So what do you say the odds are of a Red Sox win tonight? 
[01:34:00]  It's a guarantee.  Guarantee.  A hundred percent.  A hundred percent.  All right.  I don't even need to put odds on it.  Heard it here, folks.  Yep.  What about that new bit we talked about that you guys wanted me to do, but I didn't know  if I wanted to do it?  Oh, no.  You ask him.  What bit was that, Jim?  Shinkles Conundrums?  No.  I don't think we ever mentioned Shinkles Conundrums.  It's brain teasers.  Teasers for the brain. 
[01:34:30]  Like, before Mount Everest was discovered, what was the highest mountain in the world?  Shinkles Conundrums.  Shinkles Conundrums.  Shinkles Conundrums.  I'm not going with...  I just really cringed right there.  Shinkles Conundrums.  Shinkles Conundrums.  You don't like that?  I fucking hate Craig Shinkles.  Why do you do this to us?  Oh. 
[01:35:00]  I do it to you.  I do it to myself.  23 hours a day.  God.  Why does he do this to us?  He does.  He does it to himself.  I do it to myself all day.  You think it's just here?  I walk around going, Shinkles Conundrums.  Oh, that's repulsive.  I'll bring that to the show.  Believe me, I live with this.  It's awful.  I live with this.  Shinklebowdy.  Shinklebowdy.  Maybe it's a point in your head when you say that, too, though.  Shinklebowdy.  Well, we could squeeze in Jack Tover before His Highness arrives.  Our Highness Hollywood, too, but it says, Opie.  They haven't won at Fenway since 1918. 
[01:35:30]  They won the series in 2004.  That's exactly what we said.  The question was, when was the last time they won at home?  They won at home.  And the answer is 1918.  And Opie said 1918.  I know they won the World Series in 2004, was it?  Jayster is a dickbag.  Please block him or yank him out of the room today.  You want me to bounce him?  Please, please.  Jayster, sorry.  You're gone.  There he goes.  Just listen.  Oh, there's plenty of times I fuck up.  That's how it happens. 
[01:36:00]  I don't like the high voice either, so I make sure I use the high voice now.  People got to pay.  I rule this room with an iron fist.  Trust me.  Say what you rule your asshole.  Someone else's iron fist.  You listen long enough, you'll hear me fucking up a lot.  But that one was not a fuck up.  Yeah.  The question was, when was the last time at home?  Exactly.  Honestly, I remember asking that very question.  1918.  Right.  I'll be watching tonight.  1918.  I haven't watched a full World Series game. 
[01:36:30]  No?  No, but I do watch for a few innings.  I notice Tim McCarver is just a babbling idiot.  Yeah.  It's about time he leaves.  Is it time for him to step down?  And then Joe Buck is looking like a leprechaun or something.  I don't know.  What is he doing?  I don't know.  He's got really dark, like, reddish eyebrows and really dark hair.  These guys get old, you know.  He went over the top with his dye job.  Oh.  I think he might add a little follicles, too. 
[01:37:00]  Just a little bit.  Oh, yeah?  Make it a little forehead in front.  He did have that giant forehead.  Is that?  No, that's...  Giant.  I don't know.  He just looks a little creepy on camera because his eyebrows are too dark or something.  You'll notice tonight.  You'll see.  You'll see for yourself.  I won't be watching.  You won't?  No.  I don't...  I have no interest in this World Series.  It's a pretty good story, though, that the Red Sox could win at home for the first time.  Pretty much for the first time ever.  Dumb Al-Qaeda beards and fucking...  Who acknowledges 1918? 
[01:37:30]  Yeah.  You don't give a turkey, do you, Andy?  I do not give a single turkey.  And we got some knowledge yesterday.  They started growing the beards in spring training.  I did not know that.  Didn't they?  Because usually that's like a playoff beard, but it's obvious that they were growing it longer  than just the playoffs.  What, they just decided in spring training to just grow beards all year long?  Maybe it was a motivator.  Like, hey, that way when we get to the playoffs and the series, we got these big beards.  People talk about it.  Right.  I don't like beards. 
[01:38:00]  Why not?  I just think they're very itchy like they would scratch.  Yeah.  Think about it.  Think about it.  Oh, I hate the way he says it.  Points at his head.  Yeah.  Think about it.  We have a couple things.  We have Jack Tober and we also have another Mike Francesa thing.  Oh, really?  At the Daily News Reporter?  Well, we never played that.  That was fun.  They had a little battle.  They were yelling and screaming at each other. 
[01:38:30]  We never played that.  But then we got the guy that does a great impression of Mike Francesa.  We have our own guy that does a great impression of Mike Francesa.  It's not the same guy who did the 1776 video.  Yeah.  Now he does like a Civil War one, apparently.  Yeah, now he's got a follow-up.  It's Mike Francesa discussing the Civil War.  It's Francesa through history, it looks like he's going to do.  Can we hear a little of this?  See where it goes?  Okay.  You don't need the big, long intro.  Intro takes fucking forever. 
[01:39:00]  Ridiculous.  The battlefields of Antietam.  And listen, it's probably going to be a small skirmish.  Not a big deal.  That's why we have the studio set up.  Wait a second.  If he's so smart, why is he trampling on the Constitution?  Just because you don't like the guy, Mike, doesn't lose the spare presser.  If he's a smart lawyer, why is he...  Wait a second.  Why is he...  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Wait a second.  Wait a minute.  Wait a second.  No, Jim.  Don't yell at me.  Why is he...  Wait a second.  You know what?  Thanks for the call.  You're gone.  I'm not going to yell over you, okay?  When Lincoln got elected, okay? 
[01:39:30]  At some point, they decided, oh, we're going to walk around the White...  They became the Lords of the White House.  They all started to wear these top hats, walking around, oh, we're going to get rid of habeas  corpus.  Oh, we're going to talk about freeing the slaves.  You're not doing any of that.  You're in the North.  What you have to be worried about is this.  Who's going to be on your side?  Nobody.  The Europeans are going to side with the South.  Why?  I love he's always on the wrong side. 
[01:40:00]  He gets everything wrong.  They need the cotton.  The South has the cotton.  We're going to load the phones now.  Well, first up, we've got Dan in Charleston, South Carolina.  What's going on, Dan?  Hey, Mike.  How you doing?  Good.  What's up?  Yeah, I was just wondering if you'd want to hear my top five generals.  Real excited.  All right.  First, I have Alexander the Great.  Second, I have Artie Lang.  Okay.  Okay.  Sorry.  Why don't you even bomb it? 
[01:40:30]  It's not going to get on the air.  I don't know.  Does Artie, like, give you, like, a gold star or something for doing things like that?  I don't understand.  Why don't you do something useful with your time?  God.  I mean, why don't you help somebody?  It's good.  You wait on the line.  He waited on the line for two hours.  Two hours.  This is exactly what he does.  Why don't you help somebody?  Why don't you go help somebody bring back their lost slaves or their runaway slaves or something?  Help somebody.  Do something nice for a change.  God.  Something nice.  The Underground Railroad.  What? 
[01:41:00]  You know, the Underground Railroad.  I don't know who, I don't know what that is.  I don't know what you're talking about.  The Underground Railroad, Mike, with Harriet Tubman.  Who?  All right.  Now you do.  Thanks for the call.  I mean, listen, folks, you're going to call up, you're going to start making things up,  you know, making up names.  Harriet Tubman?  What kind of name is that?  On the Ground Railroad?  Mom, do you ever hear that?  I, you know, I actually was on, you know, I've been actually going on the railroad. 
[01:41:30]  It's a lot lately, actually, yeah.  You know who I ran into on the railroad the other day?  John Wilkes Booth.  Yeah.  John Wilkes Booth.  I ran into John Wilkes Booth on the railroad.  How about that?  Great guy.  Real nice guy.  He can't stand Lincoln, though.  He, oh.  He hates Lincoln.  Oh.  Yeah, I told him, you should probably do something constructive about that.  Because he's going to let me spoil it, you know?  Probably do something about that, okay? 
[01:42:00]  Go ahead.  I just wanted to talk a little bit about, you know, my father recently passed away, and  he really loved his...  I'm sorry.  Going to have to cut you off the callback amount of time.  I mean, I'm the general of the union out west.  Probably the only member of the union that will come on with me nowadays.  General Ulysses S. Grant.  General, welcome to the show.  How are you?  How are you, Mike?  Great to be on.  All right.  Now we're going to go to Phillip in Montgomery, Alabama. 
[01:42:30]  What's going on, Phillip?  Yeah, Mike.  How are you doing?  Good.  How are you?  I just want to talk a little bit about A-Rod for a minute.  No.  Something's been bothering me about it.  We're not doing that today.  We're not doing...  We're not doing...  We're not taking A-Rod calls today.  Call back 150 years from now.  Then we'll be late.  The union and the confederacy about to square off.  Now listen.  I don't think this will be a major battle.  I don't think there will be a heavy loss of life. 
[01:43:00]  But I do think this is an important battle.  Because I think this will cement the war for Robert E. Lee.  This will show everybody.  And this will finally shut that clown up that's in the White House about any talks of free and slaves.  This will be the battle that shifts the tide to the confederacy.  Because once Robert E. Lee penetrates Maryland, it's all over.  It's all over for the union.  But listen.  I can't give you exact play-by-play. 
[01:43:30]  I'm not allowed.  I'll get in trouble if I give you exact play-by-play of what's going on on the battlefield.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  Is that a direct hit?  Did he just hit him?  Mons, was that a direct hit with the cannon?  Okay.  Folks.  Robert E. Lee just directed cannon fire towards the center.  Okay.  And that...  Wow.  What?  McKellen refuses to send in the second line.  Wow.  Wow.  And once I can't do exact play-by-play, but...  Okay. 
[01:44:00]  But...  Why isn't he sending in the second line?  Yeah, but let's be honest.  You got a little help there.  You got a little help towards the end of that battle.  That's why, you know...  I mean, let's be honest.  Your rise to prominence really started because you got help during that battle and during that struggle.  What are you trying to say, Mike?  Well, wait a second.  Wait a little.  Well, don't get sensitive to you, okay?  I know you're going to be a little...  You're going to be sensitive.  I mean, come on.  General.  I'm trying to say I needed help to win that battle.  I think he goes too long with these stuff. 
[01:44:30]  Yeah, but he should probably do them shorter.  Yeah, yeah.  But he's a very...  He's a great...  I'm guessing Mike likes these, too.  I'll bet you Mike...  He refuses to acknowledge them.  He says he hasn't...  He hasn't seen them.  He doesn't know what's talking about.  I don't know what YouTube is.  He's not...  Of course he's seen them, but he doesn't want to acknowledge that he's seen them.  I don't know what YouTube...  He doesn't watch YouTube.  He doesn't watch.  The guy needs a little better production value, too.  Like, he's Mike in the room.  I kind of like that.  It's cheesy.  But he's Mike in the room instead of himself.  Yeah, he's got a fucking...  He should at least Mike himself. 
[01:45:00]  Headset Mike.  Right.  I think our guy does a bit of a better Francesa.  This guy does a great Francesa.  Yeah, yeah.  But the guy that calls up racist Francesa, I think, does a better pure Francesa.  Yeah, yeah.  Even though this guy's good.  Yeah, this guy's got, like, the mannerisms and stuff.  Yeah.  He cuts a collar off.  Or subtle...  His dumb smile.  Subtle tease, yeah.  All right.  I think we've got to go back in a break for live reasons, because we went so long.  Oh, I hate that.  I know.  It happens.  And then we've got...  Oh, goodness.  We've got His Highness coming in today for the first time in years. 
[01:45:30]  Yep.  A couple years, at least.  Ian.  I think Jeffries is calling in to say hi quickly today.  And I think we're going to squeeze in some jocktober next.  Squeeze.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Sirius XM.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  On Sirius XM.  And now, 99 seconds of Canadian author Ian Halperin defending Canada.  And go. 
[01:46:00]  What's the capital of Canada?  Oh, no.  Saskatchewan.  Anyone here know the capital of Canada?  I honestly do not know.  Come on.  I would guess...  I rest my case.  I rest my case.  I think it doesn't matter.  Of course it matters.  Everyone gives a shit.  Every Canadian...  I don't know the matter...  Every Canadian, when you ask them, what's the capital here, they will respond.  Because the U.S. is popularly more interesting.  Because Canadians want to be Americans.  We don't give a shit about Canada.  Yes, it is a problem in the U.S.  When we were creating a light bulb to read by. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  And that's...  Ian.  Ian.  That's my point.  You have a Canadian resemblance of the U.S.  It's not the entire world.  Step out.  See the world get educated.  I fly everywhere.  You cannot even name the capital of Canada.  I don't care about that.  I don't give a shit about that.  Because we are in business together.  What was your original name of Black Sabbath?  What was your original name of Black Sabbath?  I don't care about your Black Sabbath.  That's how I feel about Canada's capital.  Who gives a shit?  There you go.  There's your answer.  I'll tell you.  What's not the answer to your real name?  Exactly.  But any Canadian will name the capital of the U.S. 
[01:47:00]  And you guys...  What's down here keeping you from getting fucked?  I kept you from getting fucked by communists.  Exactly.  How about...  Communists?  Yes.  Yes.  Dude, I could go...  Russia would have stomped over...  Let me tell you something.  Stomped over Canada for the United States.  I could go to the hospital today, check in, and I don't get an outrageous bill.  Yeah.  You guys got to go and you're fucked up.  Wait online.  Wait online.  What's the name of my HBO special?  What's the name of my HBO special?  Dude.  No, no.  You don't know.  I'm not big enough for you just to know that. 
[01:47:30]  That's the way it is about Canada.  We don't look at Canada like that.  We are neighbors in business.  Canada and the U.S.  Stop it, you silly goose.  We have to wrap up.  You're out of your mind.  We got to wrap up.  But it's Ottawa.  We all know that.  That was Canadian author Ian Halperin defending Canada unsuccessfully on the Opie and Anthony  show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Continues.  Oh, yeah.  Getting ready for Jacktober.  Let's do some Jacktober. 
[01:48:00]  Ian Halperin will be in studio in a few minutes.  Oh, yeah.  What is he even promoting?  He's in town.  He's filming a movie.  What's he filming?  What movie?  I did no research on Ian Halperin's appearance today.  He's filming a special.  I know last time he was in town, two years ago, he was filming a movie about Lady Gaga.  That he was actually, he's going to put me in.  He told me.  Nice.  Hey, how'd that work out? 
[01:48:30]  I guess he just hasn't gotten to my part yet.  Oh, right.  Okay.  Did the movie ever hit?  Still editing.  Or is he still working on the movie?  I think he must still be filming.  Of course.  Yeah.  But, yeah.  I mean, no.  We got a whole one sheet full of information.  Can't wait.  Yeah, I see that.  I like the one sheet of info on Ian Halperin.  Yeah.  I want to make sure you guys are prepared.  I actually love it, actually.  That way, it's just something you can pick off the bullet points to figure out your questioning.  Uh-huh.  Well, for the people who don't know, His Highness. 
[01:49:00]  His Highness Hollywood.  His Highness Hollywood, Ian Halperin.  Ian is an accomplished saxophone player.  True.  Ian loves black women.  Oh, right.  Ian has lots of sex.  He has claimed to have had a threesome with Jill Nicolini.  And sex.  We are here to say I highly doubt it, by the way.  And he always started claiming that after he found out Ant was dating her at the time,  which was about three to four years ago.  Right.  Ian once took a photo nearly nude with Troy in a bed. 
[01:49:30]  That's true.  When he had his bed in, I guess, that no one cared about.  In a hotel somewhere with the American flag on the wall.  Right.  Remember that?  Of course.  Yeah, the press that covered that event consisted of me and Troy.  Right.  Ian is in town to film a special.  We know that.  Ian routinely gets the scoop.  Yeah.  Ian has a unique fashion sense.  Oh, and you forgot that he buys friends and women.  Hey, look.  Yeah, they showed the other one, Fox News. 
[01:50:00]  Oh, I miss the show.  I miss the show on the mic.  Yeah, it's taken over.  You forgot about that.  Ian really doesn't have any friends.  And remember the time he brought those two women in, making believe he was partying with them all night.  We broke it down and it turns out he hired them.  He buys friends for the day.  The one woman that finally admitted it.  We got her on the phone.  Yeah.  She was an actress that he hired off Craigslist.  What?  Many people theorize that he has a crush on Anthony Cumia.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:50:30]  And Ian once brought a man to the studio with a French accent, but the accent disappeared when he was in the bathroom.  Yeah.  A fake French accent.  I can't wait to see him.  I don't know what to make of Ian.  There's nothing to be made of him.  He's the man.  Just enjoy it.  Is that it?  Yes.  All right.  Sam and I are very excited.  It's Jocktober.  A celebration of all things shitty in radio.  That's not very nice.  Fantastic failures of pontificating proportions. 
[01:51:00]  That's so bad.  Wow.  An interactive exploration of what makes radio rancid.  Jocktober.  O-M-G.  Hosts.  Holes.  Bits.  And stunt boys.  This isn't funny.  It's time for Jocktober.  I want to see the Bolt movie.  Nice.  Did we find that tweet from Melissa from yesterday?  We took, what was the show?  See, I forgot the show from yesterday already. 
[01:51:30]  I believe it was Melissa and Jack.  Oh, yeah.  Melissa and Jack.  We were talking about them yesterday for Jocktober.  We didn't finish their little Jocktober segment.  And there was actually a bit on there I wanted to get to.  They skated.  But Melissa, she's on Twitter.  She writes, which one was it now?  It's this one right here.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  I'm an ONA fan.  Been sadly laughing, cringing at Jocktober bits all month. 
[01:52:00]  Karma, I guess.  She writes, I'm an ONA fan.  Been sadly laughing, cringing at Jocktober bits all month.  Karma, I guess.  LOL.  Well, in response to somebody saying they heard her getting lambasted yesterday.  Oh, man.  Wouldn't have assumed to.  Oh, it was the Entourage thing.  I guess we don't have to do that.  They went on and on and on and on about the fact that Entourage is going to be a movie.  Oh, great.  The reason that there's three tracks is because that's the same story done three times throughout the same show. 
[01:52:30]  Oh, Christ.  Don't do that.  If she's a fan, don't do that.  Don't.  Yeah.  No.  And it's not.  It's not.  No.  Don't do that.  Just don't do that.  Roll up the newspaper.  Yes.  No.  Put your face in it.  And you won't be on our radar.  Why would you do that?  Exactly.  And it's not like they replayed it.  It's a one minute entertainment story that they just did three times in the same show.  Oh, boy.  As if it was new every time. 
[01:53:00]  No.  You don't need to do that.  Same jokes.  No.  Crinkled in.  No.  Well, today we go to Detroit.  That's right.  We do.  Big fucking bird.  The bald eagle.  The eagle.  Yeah, no shit.  Yeah.  Do you pet them or are they not friendly?  What?  I don't know.  When the guy's holding it.  Oh, look at the fox.  Thanks, man.  What does the...  Canine cat.  A gray fox.  Why don't you get one of those for your house?  Yeah, that'd be great.  A canine cat, it's called it, like you said.  It's a, yeah, a gray fox.  That looks kind of cool.  What does he say, though? 
[01:53:30]  Good.  Is that right?  And when you're the smallest carnivore, the wolves, the coyotes...  All right.  That's a stupid animal segment on TV.  Who doesn't like a good animal segment?  What's he say, though?  Nying, nying, nying, nying.  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  Beer, beer, beer, beer.  What does the chip say?  Look at those beards.  It's going down at Fedway tonight.  And then they shaved their heads to make it even more. 
[01:54:00]  Do all of them have it?  A lot of them have it.  It looks stupid.  Big Poppy wasn't all in.  He's got a little something, but he didn't go all in.  Yeah.  Because that would have been like a Philly beard for Big Poppy.  Oh, yeah.  Ooh.  That's cool.  The lynx is nice.  That's pretty cool looking.  Is that a wild animal?  A little.  What do you think?  Look at his face.  It has wild animal hair.  That shit will rip your fucking throat.  Yeah, he's a.  Let's get some of these animals in studio.  Powerful predators. 
[01:54:30]  The lynx.  How big do they get, the lynx?  I don't think much bigger than that.  I bet that's about it.  They're pretty, uh, pretty small.  Yeah.  No, those are fucking paws.  Look at those paws.  They're huge.  Oh, my God.  That is giant.  Okay.  So we have Gabe here coming on with our little African serval.  Gabe is yawning.  Oh, what a pretty animal.  People actually have these at home.  We're talking about the big feet and growing into the big feet of the next.  Look at the serval.  Look at the giant ears.  And those, what's a giraffe cat?  Look at how low his little legs are. 
[01:55:00]  They are listening for birds flying.  Well, these guys aren't friends.  I'm taking it.  They actually are friends, but they play so rough.  Let's see him play.  Oh, we don't.  They play so rough, unfortunately, it doesn't make for good TV.  But they do get along.  That would make great TV.  Of course it makes great TV.  All right.  At least they said that.  I have a feeling.  They did say that.  They did say that.  Let's do some Jack Gilbert.  Jack Char.  We got to start getting animals back on our show.  Remember the guy that had the baby elephant waiting outside? 
[01:55:30]  We couldn't bring it in the elevator.  I think that guy ended up getting arrested.  I think he did.  Some illegal shit.  Some fucking crimes against fucking animals.  Because, hey, man, if you want to, I have a baby elephant on the street right now in a truck,  but I don't know how to get it up here.  Bring him up.  Oh, man.  I want to pet some animals.  Yeah.  The toucan.  You want to pet the trouser snake, Jim?  With your tongue?  No, I don't.  That's not the answer.  Give him a whole tongue petting. 
[01:56:00]  That's a pecker.  Ah.  You're very smart, Chipper.  Whoa.  Fucking Jacktober sucks.  Get over it.  It's going to blow me.  Yo, Chipper.  Kiss the anaconda.  Guys, we can't do Jacktober today.  Why?  Oh, no.  Because DG Witty writes, of course, just me.  I mean, there's other people on the show.  You cunt.  Ouch.  OP Radio.  Fucking Jacktober sucks.  Get over it.  Stop doing it. 
[01:56:30]  It's never funny.  Real fans hate it, he says.  Oh, okay.  He speaks for everybody.  This is the...  Real fans hate it.  The reaction that we want at the end of October for Jacktober.  This is...  We want everybody fed up with it.  Right.  So relax, dick big.  We go to Detroit today.  The day.  Detroit's hit music.  Channel 9...  They call themselves Channel 95.5?  They call themselves Channel 95.5.  I wonder what the PD's fucking... 
[01:57:00]  And consultants' idea behind that was.  Let's call it a channel.  Because that's different.  It's not a radio station anymore.  Or, you know, people...  Everything's on a channel.  We don't mind different, but then some of the different is like, who gives a fuck different?  It doesn't matter, right?  It doesn't matter.  People are either going to listen or not.  If the content's there, you could call it fucking...  Shit radio.  Yeah.  Yes.  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  It's absolutely right.  But a PD could never imagine to do something sort of like that. 
[01:57:30]  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it's time to beat the shit out of Mojo in the morning.  Mojo in the morning.  I think there's a lot of Mojos in the morning across America.  Is it like...  I think.  ...Monique and Joe or something?  No, no, no.  His name's Mojo.  His name.  He's got some Mojo working, huh?  Oh, yeah.  Does he got a chick?  Oh, yeah.  Mojo Rising, right?  Oh, yes.  Who's the...  Who are the principal players here?  Well, you're talking about Mojo?  Oh, boy. 
[01:58:00]  Which one is the Mojo?  Mojo's right there.  Right in the center, baby.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  You got Shannon, who's there to be like, yeah, Mojo.  Bless you, sweetie.  Fucking flu shot.  That makes sense.  That's another one.  She don't look...  Well, too bad there, but we know that chicks in radio can be what they call two-faces.  Can be a bit on the frumpy side.  Something could happen in that next photo.  All right.  And then, of course, you got your wild man on the loose.  Oh, shit.  And that's Spike. 
[01:58:30]  Spike.  Spike.  Oh, God.  Spike, why don't you come in here and tell us what you did last night?  Oh, man.  Whoa.  I'm there drinking with my friend.  I'll get us all fired, if I tell you.  Oh, my God, man.  I can't do that.  Oh, Spike.  Spike's a little bit of a liability.  Get ready on the dump button, because I'm not sure if this is going to fly.  He's a little bit of a liability, but when you want to rely on somebody to really get  a good prank out there, Spike's your guy. 
[01:59:00]  I like it.  Although I enjoyed the dick church picture.  Oh.  I saw that yesterday in my own travels.  Yeah?  Ariel shot of a church and looks just like a dick.  Wow.  That is fucked up.  Okay.  Anyway, it's Mojo in the Morning.  Detroit's hit music.  He's the king of the radio bits, this Mojo guy.  Oh, yeah?  I find him to be.  I was thinking about putting together a compilation of all the different bits we featured during  the month of Jocktober this year.  Why bother when you could just listen to Mojo? 
[01:59:30]  Oh, okay.  He's doing the...  All right, Mojo.  Because he may or may not be doing every single one.  Well, the first one is the senseless survey.  A senseless survey.  It's a new one.  This is a staple of the radio, the senseless...  What?  It's a senseless survey.  Did you say census or senseless?  Senseless.  Ah.  That's funny.  Because remember when the census was a thing?  Yeah.  You're in your car and you just start yelling at your radio, who gives a fuck? 
[02:00:00]  Hey, people wait for these benchmarks.  You think?  Yeah.  It's time for an official government survey.  It's Mojo in the Morning's Senseless Survey.  Production.  Hello?  Hello, sir.  This is Mr. Dabalina Khan from the U.S. Senseless Bureau.  How are you?  It's funny.  I'm fine.  Good.  We got your census form in the mail.  The one that you mailed out to us a few months ago?  Yes.  It doesn't sound like a Mojo.  No, that's Spike.  Ah.  You don't sound like a Spike.  You don't sound like a Spike. 
[02:00:30]  What's he sound like?  Spike has to be more, you know.  Yeah.  Hey.  Oh, look out.  Look out.  Can't even believe I made it to work this morning.  Whiskey and cigarette voice.  That's right.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  A few months ago?  Yes.  The back page, there was two questions left blank.  Can I just ask you those two questions really quickly?  Yeah.  First, starting with, how do you feel the U.S. economy is shaping up?  Mm-hmm.  That's a good question.  Poor.  And how many times this year have you been struck by lightning?  What?  Oh. 
[02:01:00]  London.  And finally, have you ever used a Post-it note to remind you to buy more Post-it notes?  Oh.  No.  And are you more lovey-dovey or schmoozy-woozy?  Ah, that's a good one.  Schmoozy-goozy.  And sir, what is your favorite curse word?  All right.  Perfect.  What did he say, James?  Can I say this, though?  That's the most convincing guy on the line that I've heard, though.  The other guy really sounds like a real caller.  Yeah.  By the way, he's answering these mundane, awful questions.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, senseless questions, you mean? 
[02:01:30]  Senseless.  But I mean, if he's a fake, he's actually a really good fake, because he just sounds awful.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he's not really good, though.  It's boring as all.  Yeah.  That's not a good bit.  He's a less productive.  Ah.  Just like him.  Right.  Being in that census surveys are so topical, and this is going so well.  Ah.  We continue?  You gotta continue.  And when's the last time you had a good pillow fight?  Uh, I guess about five weeks ago.  And have you created a blog to write about...  My grandmother, she was on her back, and I put one over her face, and I won. 
[02:02:00]  I won her inheritance.  There you go.  And have you created a blog to write about your favorite Supreme Court justice?  No.  And just the last two questions.  Which would you rather have, six of one or half a dozen of the other?  Oh, my God, this is awful.  So terrible.  What are you doing?  It's the same fucking thing.  Go on, champ.  Oh.  A little word...  Having fun with wordplay, are you? 
[02:02:30]  Well, it's just senseless.  Wordplay's fun.  Six and a half.  And if an angel gets his wings every time a bell rings, what happens when a foghorn blows?  I get fly away.  I'll say I get cum in my mouth.  Cartoon humor.  No, but it just...  The absurdity of hearing that from a fucking grown-up. 
[02:03:00]  It just struck me like, this is our job.  I am the worst.  No, but that was perfect at work.  Now we got a real problem on our hands.  The one guy on Twitter, I already forgot his fucking Twitter handle, said real fans don't  like Jocktober.  Yeah, yeah.  Now I got a guy, it's E-I-H-T on Twitter.  He writes, real fan here, I love Jocktober.  Now what do we do?  So now what do we do? 
[02:03:30]  Because the other guy said the real fans don't like Jocktober, and this guy's saying the real  fans do like Jocktober.  More importantly, the fans of the show that we're featuring, Mojo in the Morning, are  even stranger than ours.  There's a photo on their Facebook.  Right.  And it appears to be...  Oh my God.  I don't know if this is a Photoshop or...  This is a Jocktober mashup.  This could be legit.  This looks to be Dennis Falcone, who's in great shape, having sex with Terry Clifford from  behind.  Yes, yes.  Son of a bitch. 
[02:04:00]  I was suspicious the whole time with this guy.  According to this photo, it looks like Dennis Falcone and Terry Clifford are engaged.  I'm not sure.  It's a very good job, but I might be Photoshopped.  Really?  Yeah.  You gotta kind of say that, yes.  Oh boy.  Maybe.  You don't really, but it's just such a ludicrous fucking square picture, pasted over people's  faces.  The heads are the same size as the bodies.  Ridiculous.  Yeah.  Get Photoshopped.  It's cheap.  All right.  And if you had a vanity license plate, what would it say? 
[02:04:30]  It's still going, huh?  Bob.  Bob?  Have you checked to see if that's available?  Oh, I can't get it.  Somebody already has it.  Somebody already has Bob?  Get out of here.  So, I got somebody coming to the door.  Oh, go ahead.  I'll wait.  There's no one coming to his door.  I think he lied to me.  I think that was actually a real call.  It could have been.  They might have snuck that in.  Send us questions and Spike will use them.  Oh, God.  Will he?  He will use your questions.  Yeah.  I mean, sometimes these radio shows do take the chance and squeeze in a real phone call. 
[02:05:00]  That guy was too good to be an actor, man.  Bye.  The bit itself stinks.  Who cares?  You want to combine a good bit with real people.  Or how about you have to kind of like not just ask the question, then you have to kind  of go with it a little bit, right?  Yeah.  And interact with the guy.  Actually ask uncomfortable questions.  Right.  Not half a dozen in the other.  You guys remember Melissa and Jack?  And Melissa's a fan of the show.  Two American kids growing up in the heartland?  No, no, no, no.  Jack and Diane.  Oh, right. 
[02:05:30]  Sorry.  Melissa and Jack is different.  Sorry.  Jack and Diane in the morning.  Got that.  You know it's out there somewhere.  Huh?  I'm Melissa and Jack.  And Melissa's a fan of the show.  And blah, blah, blah.  And she's bummed that we took shots at her.  Yeah.  What the fuck was that?  Yeah.  That's a teeny.  A micro penis.  A micro penis.  A micro penis.  Sucked into a big fat belly.  With a lot of.  Christ.  What is it called?  The pubis fat?  The fatty pubis.  The fatty pubis.  What's the pubis fat called?  Pubis fat.  I don't know.  Was there a dumb name for that?  Probably some type of a fatty pubis. 
[02:06:00]  That's when the fat cells coagulate and they become liquefied and they  solidify inside your skin.  What was a pouch?  A pouch.  A pouch of a fatty pubis.  Which is what my mustache is made out of.  The hairs that grow under a fatty pubis.  I use those.  Then I use worm semen to glue them to my face.  Well, remember Melissa and Jack. 
[02:06:30]  They were doing that second date bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was brilliant.  If she truly is a fan of ours and if she's listening right now, just do us a favor and  just don't do that bit anymore, please.  Just drop it.  Start there.  That was their alternative to War of the Roses.  Well, don't do War of the Roses either.  And remember we said that I bet you this is a bit that a lot of radio shows are doing  the second date bit.  Uh-huh.  Well.  No.  Just in case you didn't believe us yesterday.  Ah.  It's the second date update. 
[02:07:00]  A mojo in the morning.  Ah.  And they can't even, this is what drives me nuts, they can't even like make it their  own by just changing the name of it.  Right.  Nothing.  Oh.  Oh.  That one ounce of originality.  That's terrible, man.  Why?  Why?  A second date is a big bit.  You make it to Detroit radio.  That's a big market and you're doing these shitty bits that everyone else is doing?  Why would you do that to yourself?  I bet the second date bit people don't allow you to change the name. 
[02:07:30]  Probably.  Because they want it to become a big thing so they can sell it to other stations.  It's branded?  Oh, yeah.  Well, as a PD I would say, no thank you, we don't need any of these branded fucking bits.  And then you just do them yourself.  Well.  Rip them off yourself.  Well, creativity, you spin shit and make it your own.  Yeah.  That's the key to creativity.  Yes.  People are all influenced with people that came before them, but if you're just completely  ripping them off, that's horrible.  Your own ideas.  But you're influenced and you spin it and make it kind of your own. 
[02:08:00]  Then it's unique.  Why can't a PD hire some radio people and they go, I have confidence in my guys that  we don't need these branded bits.  Oh, they did.  If you're going to do a bit, make original, how can they not have...  But you could say, okay, radio stations are doing the second date bit.  What could we do here in Detroit?  And you throw it around a little bit and figure something out.  Yeah.  Like, say you had a guy who had brain teasers.  I don't know who you're talking about. 
[02:08:30]  They do something like...  Oh, no.  Shakele's conundrums.  No.  What word of the English language is always spelled incorrectly?  Shakele bow.  So anyway, they do second date just like Melissa and Jack do.  Is the answer incorrectly?  It's the second date update.  A mojo in the morning.  All right.  So a second date update here.  Danny, it sounds like, actually had a pretty good date.  Matter of fact, Danny, how many dates did you get with Megan?  Oh, I had two with Megan, but that was three weeks ago. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, okay.  So you haven't talked to her then in three weeks?  No, but it was two days in a row.  It was really weird.  The first day, we went out for dinner.  And then the following day, we touched base.  And she came over to my place and we hung out and watched a movie.  So I thought things were moving really freaking fast.  And then three weeks go by.  Now, you also told us that she spent the night with you.  Was that on the first date or the second date?  The second date.  What was the spending the night thing?  Was that intentional?  Were you guys fooling around with each other? 
[02:09:30]  Or what was the deal?  Oh, I mean, I don't know.  It's always on the back of everybody's mind, isn't it?  Yeah.  It's the same guy.  Yeah.  I mean, it happened on the second date.  Sounds like the same guy.  Sounds like him.  What?  No.  No?  No.  Oh, you mean it's the other date call.  Yeah.  Sounds exactly like the same guy from the other date call.  Are we playing back-to-back?  I thought you meant something else.  Yeah.  And then they don't even inject their own personalities into these fucking bits everyone's doing.  No, no.  So it might as well be the exact same station. 
[02:10:00]  Why would you hire people to do this?  Time for the second date.  All right, hold on.  So you're thinking...  You'd think you'd want to hire someone.  Hold on.  Syndicate the same morning show.  This is from yesterday.  Second Date Playback on 103.7 Play.  Second Date is where we attempt to help you with your love life.  Sometimes you go on what you thought was a great first date, only to have the person  not call you, not text you afterwards, just completely ignore you.  And that's where we come in.  We actually put them on the radio, and we try to get them to tell you what went wrong  and why they haven't called you back for a second date.  Good morning, Craig.  How are you? 
[02:10:30]  Pretty good.  All right, Craig.  So tell us what happened.  So this girl that comes into the bar where I bartend.  I would say different already.  Yeah?  Good date.  Matter of fact, Danny, how many dates did you get with Megan?  Oh, I had two with Megan, but that was three weeks ago.  Oh, okay.  Huh.  And she has been, I guess you would say, hounding me for like the last two months.  So you haven't talked to her then in three weeks?  No, but it was two days in a row.  It was really weird.  The first day we went out for dinner, her friends have also been mentioning it. 
[02:11:00]  She's just been really...  Yeah, it's different.  It's different, guys.  It's hard to tell.  The phone tonality is different, but...  Yeah, so...  Yeah, it did different.  So whatever happened there, I didn't listen.  So now they get the broad on the phone.  Oh, right.  That's where it gets crazy.  Well, I have to let you know, she is safe.  We were able to get in touch with her and got her on the phone.  So she is alive and there is...  Wait, why is this guy calling that guy?  What's the premise there? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because yesterday, remember, it was a friend.  Oh, yeah.  The guy called up and said, you know, his date had gone poorly and now he doesn't know.  He said, I don't even know if the girl is safe because she hasn't called me in three  weeks.  So now the guy is just going to call the girl.  The mojo is just going to call the girl.  But how would he already...  We got a hold of the girl if they didn't even know they were taking this call yet.  Right.  There's no setup as to how that call.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Yes.  There's no justification for him calling the guy.  That's why I got confused.  The guy called and said, yeah, I had a horrible second date or whatever. 
[02:12:00]  And then this guy is like, well, she's okay.  We got a hold of her.  But why would you get a hold of her if you didn't take the call yet?  Exactly.  They put no work into it.  There's no writing.  There's no nothing.  Oh, boy.  A reason why she hasn't been calling you back.  And we're going to find out exactly what's going on this morning.  Say hello, if you can, Megan, to Danny, who...  ...is worried about you.  Um, hello.  Oh, boy.  Too awesome. 
[02:12:30]  Um, hey.  Normally, this is awkward.  This is really awkward.  This is very awkward.  It's awkward because it's not believable.  At least you're admitting...  Oh, you're not admitting that?  Oh, we're just thinking it's awkward.  Yeah.  Very awkward.  Megan, Danny was worried about you because he was worried about your safety  because he hadn't been able to get in touch with you in the last three weeks.  That's not true.  He was just wondering why you haven't called him back in three weeks.  Oh, boy.  Right to the point.  Um, well, to be honest, I noticed something about his car that just turned me off. 
[02:13:00]  Oh, Bobby in the trunk.  There was something about what?  Yeah, a missing passenger seat and handcuffs.  Something about his car that turned you off.  Yeah.  Okay.  And what was it about his car that turned you off?  His license plate says...  Ask me.  Studly.  And then the...  Wait, what?  You broke up there.  Say it again.  His license plate says Studly. 
[02:13:30]  And then the number one.  He's got a vanity plate.  Oh.  Who gets Studly for themselves?  Come on.  That's so cheesy.  Danny.  See, they don't even believe their own premise of that.  That's their own brain slipping.  Yeah, they're like, oh, who would get that, huh?  They're getting mad at the intern who wrote this unbelievable script.  Come on, that's so cheesy.  Danny, is that true?  Do you have the...  Is your license plate Studly and then the number one?  And then it becomes a bad acting. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, it's true.  See, it follows what you said the other day.  Yeah, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  Because you don't know really what to say as an actor there.  First of all, there are license plates that don't even get close to being Studly one  that are rejected.  A state wouldn't allow Studly as a fucking plate.  Exactly.  They just don't do that.  Mojo in the morning.  Christina.  Good morning, Mojo.  Good morning.  I'm sorry with you about the whole vanity license plate thing, but that's not a reason 
[02:14:30]  to break up with someone.  Right.  So what I'm thinking is that Studly one just wasn't Studly in bed.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Wow.  Oh, boy.  Megan?  Anything you want to tell us about that?  I wouldn't necessarily disagree.  Okay.  She's trying to be polite about it.  Now she's being polite. 
[02:15:00]  She wasn't calling him back.  I stopped breathing, I guess.  I know.  I'm just like.  I don't even understand what happened.  It's the second date.  But who's the other broad?  Some caller.  Some caller?  They went to the phones and said, hey.  Let's talk to the caller.  It's about if you think Studly one is a bad license plate.  And then the caller figured out that, oh, maybe he just sucks in bed.  And then she goes, well, I wouldn't disagree with that.  And they went, ooh.  Oh, God.  I'm kind of glad it's October.  I am really glad it's winding down. 
[02:15:30]  Although tomorrow.  Yeah.  Gang.  We looked at ourselves.  Oh.  We turned the old camera around.  I forgot that.  We do this every year.  Our own douchebaggery.  Just to show everyone that in the end it's just fun.  Come on.  We're just having a good time.  Please do it early.  Should I have to leave a little early tomorrow?  No problem.  Please do it early.  I don't want to miss it.  I told the guys I don't even want to know what they picked.  So it's going to be a complete surprise what horrendous, stupid radio thing we did in 
[02:16:00]  the past that they picked for the conclusion of Jocktober tomorrow.  Oh, boy.  Well, time for another Mojo original.  Original.  Yep.  A little bit he likes to call.  He likes to call the phone scam.  Come on.  No.  All right.  This shit writes itself.  Let's tally it up so far.  We started with senseless survey.  Right.  Which we hear. 
[02:16:30]  Once a while.  We moved on to the second date update.  Right.  Which we've heard from Jack and Melissa yesterday.  Now we move to phone scam.  Right.  Phone scam.  As we look at Mojo in the Morning in Detroit for today's Jocktober.  It's Mojo in the Morning phone scams.  Bruce just got a brand new fridge.  But when the guys delivered the fridge, they didn't want to take the old one away.  So he had to tip the guys.  And he's still mad about it.  So Spike's scamming him this morning.  It's Mojo in the Morning.  What's the premise? 
[02:17:00]  Something about a refrigerator.  And what?  He had to tip the guy just so the guy would take his old refrigerator.  How much is that?  What is that?  A lousy ten bucks?  Why is this an issue?  Now you convoluted.  Now you watch.  They're going to call him up.  And it's going to be they're demanding more money or something, I bet.  What?  Oh, he's going to be mad.  Whatever it is.  Phone scam.  Love a good phone scam.  Yeah, how you doing?  I'm looking for Bruce.  This is Mickey Goldmill.  More Mickey Goldmill.  Bruce, how you doing? 
[02:17:30]  More jerky, boys.  He ripped it off from Todd.  I bet he ripped it off from Todd, who ripped it off from Jericho.  He has a wacky name.  He's not that bad.  What's his name?  Goldmill.  Goldmill.  Mickey Goldmill.  But he said it with that name.  Mickey Goldmill.  Hey, yeah, jerky.  Look.  And all these losers probably look up to the king loser.  Todd.  Todd.  And go, oh, fuck.  We've got to be just like Todd.  Get Brett Weir, I've said.  Right.  We've got to get a crazier name.  Like what?  Hey, how you doing? 
[02:18:00]  This is McBoobies McDuffie Snuckles.  I got a, uh, I went down to buy a trophy and they put a cake on my head.  I don't know what to do with a cake on my head.  It's crazy.  I can't believe you keep people on the phone for stuff like that.  Yeah.  Hey, how you doing there, turkey?  Who's this?  Hey, this is, uh, hey, this is Ankle's, Ankle's Stoodlebuckle.  How do you spell that?  Ah, A-N-K-L-S Stoodlebuckle. 
[02:18:30]  And, uh, I went down to your store the other day and the old lady put, uh, put socks in my wig.  Socks in your wig?  Ah.  Well, that doesn't sound like something that would happen here.  Well, it did happen there, uh, jerky.  Jerky.  What was your name again?  My, my name is Ankle's McStoodle-Snocks.  This is just how those dumb fucking calls go. 
[02:19:00]  Mickey Goldmill from...  I'm calling about the delivery you had at your house.  Yeah.  Wait, I might be wrong.  Huh?  Is Mickey Goldmill?  No.  I'm thinking it's Mickey from Rocky.  Oh, no.  But his name might have been Goldstein.  Oh, no.  It was Goldstein or Gold.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I'm thinking Goldmill.  I could be wrong.  Wow, that would be a good...  That might be just a name of, uh...  But that would be a way to get your fake names, right?  Images from Mickey Goldmill.  It was Mickey Goldmill.  Okay.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Good fucking call.  Good one. 
[02:19:30]  Uh, yeah.  This is Bruce.  Bruce, how you doing?  Uh, Mickey Goldmill from...  I'm calling about the delivery you had at your house last month.  You had some of my workers remove your old fridge?  Oh, sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I'm calling because that was an illegal thing to do.  Uh, they weren't supposed to move your fridge.  Uh, uh, and, uh, kind of calling to say, I don't appreciate you.  You're not supposed to bribe our workers with cash.  Well, hey, now, listen.  None of your paperwork said anything about removing a sub-zero fridge. 
[02:20:00]  And thank goodness, your workers were gracious enough to help me out.  But they didn't say anything in the paperwork about that.  What did it say in the paperwork about you bribing my employees?  No.  What do you mean bribing my employees?  Is that what you're going to get into?  What, do you got a receipt?  A receipt for what?  Exactly.  Oh, I see.  So, you're saying you didn't pay them.  Okay.  So, if you didn't pay them, how come the fridge is back in my warehouse?  The fridge is back in your warehouse because that's what your ad said you'd do.  You'd come out, you'd take my fridge and deliver the old one. 
[02:20:30]  No.  If you read the whole ad, it says, uh, restrictions do apply.  You, we don't do a...  No, your salesman didn't say restrictions do apply.  Well, your fridge is a...  And your paperwork didn't say that restrictions do apply.  But your fridge is a sub-zero.  It's way too big, and we don't accept this.  Well, that's not my problem.  Then you should advertise that right up.  It is your problem.  One of my workers...  My worker, Willie, has...  What do you think I'm replacing it with?  Jesus.  The guy on the phone is good, though.  The guy on the phone sounds... 
[02:21:00]  Yeah, at least he sounds...  The guy from the radio station is doing a horrendous job.  Terrible.  It's not funny.  It sounds like a phone call.  Right, right.  Absolutely.  And that's true.  There's no humor to this.  None whatsoever.  I couldn't change the channel fast enough.  Oh, gosh.  Why would you sit through this while you're in traffic?  What's the prank?  You gotta put some crazy ideas in there.  Like what?  Hey, I got to the refrigerator, and there was a bunch...  There was a bunch of bees zipping around in there.  Oh.  I said, hey, what are you doing there, fettle chest? 
[02:21:30]  I'm sorry.  I don't know who I'm speaking with here.  Who is this?  Hey, this is Mickadoodle Wigwam.  Mickadoodle Wigwam.  I was in your store, and I got a refrigerator, and there was a bunch of bees zipping around in it.  I'm sorry to hear that.  They stung me two million times.  Two million?  All over my snookadook.  Oh, that's funny.  Now my snookadook's all swollen.  A little over-exaggeration and a funny name for a cock. 
[02:22:00]  That's good stuff.  Yeah.  That's good stuff.  Yeah.  This is heckle-nomic wigwam.  It's funny and believable.  Look, if someone waves cash in front of your face, and you don't have money, you'd take it, right?  I'll give you a break.  Listen, you got a receipt for that cash?  Did they say that I did anything?  Did they say they did something wrong?  They said you gave them 20.  They provided me good service.  I really appreciate it.  I don't know what you're trying to pull here. 
[02:22:30]  Okay.  But I have all the contracts from my sale.  You've got four guys here in the warehouse, four different guys that say you gave them 20 bucks each to move the fridge,  and now poor Willie's seen the doctor six times since he made your service call.  Give me a break.  What about when Willie said, hey, sir, we cannot move this refrigerator.  If my boss finds out, I'll get in trouble.  What did you say?  Your response was, I'll give you 20 bucks.  Well, you know, I'm sorry Willie seems to be working for an a**hole, but that's your problem.  Oh, that's a really great attitude to have. 
[02:23:00]  You know, Willie has three children at home.  Yeah, well, maybe his boss should take good care of him.  No, a**hole didn't hurt his back.  We have rules in place so this doesn't happen, but you tried to bend the rules.  Mm-hmm.  Well, then I guess that's your problem, all right?  I didn't bend the rules.  No, it's your problem, because I'm going to give Willie your home phone number, and you can call him.  Oh, yeah, that'll work out real good, won't it?  Yeah, and you can pay his medical bills, because we're not paying him.  You can take me to court, okay?  Willie said it's a sub-zero fridge.  He wasn't supposed to touch it.  He's more than happy to take this to court. 
[02:23:30]  You think because you have more money than Willie you can boss him around and do whatever you want?  Hey, this isn't about Willie.  This is about you being a p**ch.  So, what, I got to bring it into court?  I got to sue you?  Is that it?  I'd be happy to meet your ass.  Of course, you've got all his money to burn.  I'll walk all over you.  You know, Willie was also emotionally upset, because your wife kept hitting on him and saying inappropriate things.  Oh, you c**t.  Your wife said right into his ear, please phone scam my husband on the Mojo on the Morning Show.  I think I'll have my lawyer call you, rather than the other way around.  But he said it already. 
[02:24:00]  You didn't even hear what I said.  He said, please phone scam.  Yeah, he didn't, because you delivered it horribly.  What happened?  Of course he didn't hear it.  You've got to deliver that better.  Oh, yeah?  Like, how would you do it?  How are you doing?  This is Tootsie Toes McBraboodle.  McBraboodle.  Tootsie Toes?  Yeah, I was in your store, and I bought a bunch of tires.  All right.  But they gave me ice cream.  No, there's no ice cream here, sir.  That didn't happen.  They put ice cream all over my face, and now I can't feel it. 
[02:24:30]  That wouldn't have happened, sir.  Yeah, that did happen.  What's your name?  My name is Tootsie Toes McBraboodle.  You didn't even hear what I said.  You said, please phone scam my husband on Mojo in the morning.  What?  And you're on Mojo in the morning.  Oh, the big laugh.  Your wife turned you in.  Oh, isn't that a bunch of bulls?  Oh, no, no. 
[02:25:00]  We will scam you.  Oh, my God.  They did not.  That's Todd.  That's Todd.  That's Todd.  Is Todd recorded that?  It certainly is.  I wrote that and recorded it.  And I sell it.  Maybe Todd has a little side business where he's allowing the phone scams to go to other  radio stations.  Todd does have a syndicated comedy.  He might be the phone scam guy.  Yeah, but is it Todd who did it?  Or is it a different name?  I syndicate it.  I sell it out for business. 
[02:25:30]  Why do you talk like that?  What's the name on the business?  The business is Whackadoodle McNoshnooksk.  Whackadoodle.  Yeah.  Hey, this is Booby McHooders.  And I was in your store.  Name's Booby?  Booby McHooders.  What's your name over there, cool guy?  I'm not going to tell you, Booby.  Booby. 
[02:26:00]  Well.  Are we done with Jacktober?  Well, we've got one more track.  Ah, right.  Yeah.  So far, we've heard Senseless Survey.  Right.  I remember that.  We've heard the second date bit.  Legendary.  Second date update.  A couple original bits there.  A third original bit, the phone scam.  The phone scam.  Very original.  And proud to say that Mojo in the Morning finally doing a bit that no one else is doing.  All right.  Yes.  This is theirs.  I hope it's the on-air suicide. 
[02:26:30]  So, we're going to listen to this with an open mind.  Mojo.  Because we asked the...  I hope they recorded it with an open mind, like Jimmy just said.  Because we asked these radio guys to at least do original stuff.  Yeah.  Start there, at least.  Okay.  So, we've got an original bit, and we'll see how well he does it.  Let's let it go.  All right.  All right.  I'm in.  All right.  So, Megan, you are suspicious of your brother-in-law. 
[02:27:00]  Catherine, you don't seem as suspicious.  Catherine, are you okay with us?  No.  Making a phone call to him to see where he sends a dozen free roses?  No.  No.  All right.  Megan and Catherine, hang on the phone for one second.  We're going to see what happens.  Come on.  We're calling Catherine's husband.  Come on.  Keeping that, he sends the flowers to her.  There's no way.  No way.  What?  That's been done before?  What's wrong?  Oh, it's so satisfying to expose these fucking hack radio shows. 
[02:27:30]  And they're in Detroit.  They should know better.  Do you know what this show calls it?  What?  It's called War of the Roses.  Wow.  Yeah.  Do you have any of it?  Do we have some of it?  I would like to hear the fake acting.  It is one of my favorite parts.  The guy goes...  I was right at...  The exasperated guy.  Oh, oh, oh, I did honey. 
[02:28:00]  This is unorthodox because I was going to dramatically destroy the disc.  I know.  But when she goes, oh my god, I can't believe it.  And he's like...  She's all mad and...  It's suspicious.  Catherine, are you okay with us?  Making a phone call to him to see where he sends a phone call?  I was ready to stop this.  Let the people know I was ready to stop this.  I'm sorry.  I have a problem.  I have to hear it.  And Catherine, hang on the phone for one second.  Hang on there.  We're going to see what happens.  We're calling Catherine's husband.  We're hoping that he sends the flowers to her. 
[02:28:30]  God, I wish he was the guy that we talked to.  Do you recognize his voice?  A little tangerine dream.  I like that.  Train?  Risk your business?  Yes.  Hello.  I'm looking for Tony.  Yeah.  Hey, Tony.  How are you this morning?  Hello.  Good.  My name's Nicole.  I'm calling from an internet floral company.  See, he's doing the exact same thing we talked about last week. 
[02:29:00]  Uh-huh.  Where he's already on guard because he knows he's playing the part of a guy that's got to be on guard.  Right, right.  Eventually.  Like, who answers the phone like that?  He's, like, so suspicious already.  He hasn't let his character get to where it's supposed to be.  Right.  Yeah, just act like a regular dude and then you'll get to that suspicious shit.  No, he's got to start right off.  Right, because he's a bad actor.  You guys don't know what's funny.  I always tell him, act like you're staring right away.  Pick up the phone and act crazy.  Hello. 
[02:29:30]  Act scared.  And come up with a good name.  Always come up with a funny name.  Yeah.  Like, who's this, sir?  Who's this?  Hey, this is Harry McBarber.  That's funny, see?  Yeah, Harry and Barber work together.  It's very funny.  I was in your barber shop.  Oh.  And you cut my hair with a lawnmower blade.  And I want my money back.  That wouldn't have happened, sir.  It did happen.  It did happen.  And if you don't believe me, you could ask my grandma.  Who's she?  Mom's boobalookin' nooks. 
[02:30:00]  Mom's boobalookin' nooks.  Well, we never would cut someone's hair with a lawnmower blade, so I'm going to hang up, sir.  Yeah, well, you did cut my hair with a lawnmower blade and my eyebrows.  And I was on Easter Island, and one of them statues started talking, and I do a radio show with them.  There's a giant rock head in the room.  Is this a phone scam?  No.  I want to hear more bad acting. 
[02:30:30]  Rosesbloom.com with an offer for some free flowers for you.  Do you have like 20 seconds to answer two quick survey questions for me?  No, I'm on my way to work right now.  You can do it in the car.  It's just two questions, and then we're going to give you a dozen long-stem red roses.  We won't ask you for any sort of credit card info or anything.  I don't even have a credit card to use right now.  I'm not going to ask you for it anyway, so that's okay.  Do you have somebody that you'd want to send some flowers to? 
[02:31:00]  Any special occasions?  How'd you get my number, first of all?  You actually probably purchased something from one of our sister companies, and we all share information.  That's all.  Two quick questions.  That's it.  Okay?  All right.  Okay, Tony.  Have you purchased flowers in the last six months?  No.  And do you plan on purchasing flowers in the next six months?  No, not really.  Okay.  That's it.  Like I said...  Why would that matter? 
[02:31:30]  It doesn't.  That's so you could try to throw off the fucking listeners.  Oh, Christ.  This guy...  Thank you for participating in that quick survey.  Rosesbloom.com, that's the name of our company, is going to provide you with a dozen free roses.  And I'm just going to need the name of the person you want to send them to, their phone number, and we're going to send them a text...  Let's say you are cheating.  Okay.  Let's really break this down.  Let's say you are cheating.  Uh-huh.  You could buy your own stupid fucking flowers for your side piece. 
[02:32:00]  Why would you take that chance ever?  Why would you take the chance that you're being set up, that you don't know who this is?  It's very vague.  It's not like it's a new car.  It's stupid flowers.  And by the way, this happens every day in many, many cities across the country, apparently.  Guys are willing to do this.  This guy's name should be Tony Pepperoni.  Hey, this is Tony Pepperoni.  I was in your pizza store the other day, and they gave me hamburgers in my shoes. 
[02:32:30]  Sir, we wouldn't ever do that.  And I fell down the stairs, and my hamburger shoes fell off.  Hey, listen there, smirky.  Full update?  Yeah.  The wall, the public wall on their Facebook page has been taken down.  Why?  We didn't even mention it.  Yeah, I don't know why.  We didn't even fucking mention their Facebook page.  No.  I don't know why.  I'm going to send them to their phone number, and we're going to send them a text message  basically saying, you sent them flowers.  They can go on our website and pick out their arrangement and schedule their delivery time. 
[02:33:00]  Sound good?  All right.  They don't get charged?  Nobody gets charged?  Nobody gets charged.  I promise.  All right.  Okay?  So who would you like to send some flowers to?  So who would you like to send some flowers to?  Sarah.  Sarah?  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Okay.  Before I get her phone number, we can also include a message with the text.  Did you want to include something, or we can just say that they're from you?  Is his wife supposedly listening?  Yes.  So why wouldn't... 
[02:33:30]  Well, she's got to hold on for the message.  Because she's looking at her script going, oh, this is where I come in.  She's going to get mad.  Why wouldn't they at least have her come in immediately?  Oh, boy.  So you make the name Sarah Lee, and you send her a cake.  That's a funny one, too, right there.  Hey, this is Sarah Lee, and I was in your cake store.  What happened?  They gave me a bunch of rocks in my hat.  That never would have happened here at this store, sir.  It happened to me.  Don't you tell me, nerky. 
[02:34:00]  I fell down the stairs, and my rock hat fell off.  Oh, sorry.  Maybe I'll sue you.  Yeah.  That's terrible.  You know, my partner looks like he's having a stroke all the time.  Oh, Jesus.  He got a big, fat rock head face that don't move.  Oh, my.  But happy belated...  But happy belated Swedish day on that.  Okay. 
[02:34:30]  And just for our records, what is this person's relation to you?  Uh, he's a good friend.  Okay.  You would go, why do you need to know that?  For what record?  For the record?  You're keeping a record of this?  This is bad news.  Why isn't the wife jumping in yet?  That's the whole bid.  If you're going to do the fake bid, fucking do it right.  No one would sit around waiting.  We also need to mention to you, Tony, while we are on the phone with you and getting some 
[02:35:00]  information, that while we've been talking to you, that your wife, Catherine, heard every  single word you just said.  I can't believe you would do this again.  Again?  Oh.  What?  What?  What?  What?  Hello?  Yeah, see, that's the Anthony thing.  Hello?  What?  I...  But I...  Maybe she means an actor.  I can't believe you would do this again.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the Anthony thing, though. 
[02:35:30]  They all do that.  Because they fumble, and they go, oh, that's right.  I gotta say something.  I gotta say something.  Oh, but...  What?  Hello?  What is it?  Yeah.  What is it?  Your wife, Catherine, is on the phone with us right now and just heard every single word  you just said.  Do you know that I've been calling my sister a liar, that I've been defending you?  Uh-oh.  I do not even believe it.  He actually hung up the phone. 
[02:36:00]  He hung up the phone.  Oh, boy.  Why'd he hang up?  Is that that same girl, Catherine?  Yes, it is.  Listen to her fake crying.  Yes, it is.  That's fucking sad, man.  Yeah, I know.  It's not real, Chip.  I don't worry.  It is so.  Don't worry, Chip.  It's on the radio.  And then they play their part where they feel bad it's going down, but they created the  whole fake situation.  Yeah, for public enjoyment.  Right.  Yes, yes.  As entertainment on their show.  Their wacky fucking mojo show. 
[02:36:30]  Well, E-Rock, you know what to do.  Hey.  Yeah.  This is Superman Spidey Hulk.  That's...  You took three kind of superheroes.  No, it's Superman Spidey Hulk.  Yeah, that's three superheroes.  I went to buy a shirt and your car ran me over, jerky. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, it wouldn't have happened.  It did happen.  It did happen.  That's just the whole thing.  Everything ends with it did happen.  It did happen.  I would listen to that every morning, Jim.  Every morning I would listen to that.  Why not do that?  Yeah.  Go, all right, all these idiot radio stations are doing War of the Roses.  Here's our version.  Here's our version.  I'm just completely goof on it.  Well, sad to say that pretty much ends the bulk of Jocktober.  Tomorrow, we look at ourselves. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah.  Just to show everyone that we're just kind of having fun.  Just having fun.  We don't mean anything by it, guys.  No.  No harm.  No harm.  We turn it around on ourselves.  That's why I can't hang out with any radio person.  Just about any.  We've got a handful of people we like, but that's about it.  The rest of them are just fucking horseshit.  And they do it to themselves.  Yeah.  And then wonder why they're not more popular or making more money.  It's terrible.  It's a bigger fucking city, and it's right in front of their fucking eyes. 
[02:38:00]  Can you give us a hint at what tomorrow is?  Not yet.  Oh, no.  For the people who don't know, it's going to be some audio me and Ant did a long, hopefully  a long time ago.  Jesus.  At least they admit that.  No, it's good.  How many years ago?  It's a serial break from earlier this week.  Oh, God.  It so could be, too.  Yeah.  Hey, we got someone on the phone who's got a brain teaser for us.  Who's that?  What's your name?  Craig Schickle. 
[02:38:30]  How you doing, Craig?  He's going to get confused with voices.  It almost happened.  It's very interesting.  Yeah.  Who's buried at Grant's tomb?  I don't know.  Who's buried in Grant's tomb?  That's a good question.  Schickle bought it.  All right.  You think about it, turkey.  Oh, this is such a horrid exchange.  This is awful.  It stinks.  It's terrible.  Oh, it brings me such joy. 
[02:39:00]  So, tomorrow we'll look at ourselves.  Yeah.  Some horrendous audio that we did from hopefully a long time ago, or it's going to be really  awkward.  Going to take a break.  Ian Halperin, His Highness Hollywood, is next.  Stay there.  O.P.  and Anthony.  This is the O.P.  and Anthony Show.  Serious.  Next time.  The O.P.  and Anthony Show.  The guys are back from the toilet. 
[02:39:30]  Now, back to our show.  Why do you look so evil today?  Ian Halperin in studio.  Oh, yeah.  It's been a while.  Ian undercover on the Twitter.  He's always on the case.  In a while.  You look very sharp.  Sharp dress, sir.  You guys look a bit tired, but it's an honor to be here.  Well, it's good to have you.  It's the morning thing, you know? 
[02:40:00]  Norton looks great.  Thank you.  You look like you've been hitting the gym.  Yeah, it's been a while since I've seen you.  Yeah, you look fantastic.  Yes, he does.  Look, I've got to say one thing.  Thank you for having me.  It's a pleasure.  And to all the people, I get harassed by all your listeners to come back on this show all  the time.  So I'm here, and let's the good times roll.  Well, Ian, obviously, it's been a while.  Just give us a little update.  What have you been doing?  What are you working on?  In the last two years.  You know, fill the audience in on where you've been. 
[02:40:30]  I've been working on my tennis game a lot.  Oh, yeah?  I'm playing a lot of tournaments.  What do you mean you're playing a lot of tournaments?  You're a pro tennis player.  We like to say tournaments in America, by the way.  Tournaments.  Tourney?  Tournaments.  Look, I ain't going to Wimbledon, but tennis is a way of life for me.  I play about six times a week.  Wow.  Do you really?  Yes, I do.  Show me something.  Hey, the big rackets below the waist, so I'm not going to show you that.  Oh, shit.  Well, can't you do, like, some air tennis? 
[02:41:00]  I'm a lefty.  Let me tell you something.  What?  I'm a lefty.  Like John McEnroe.  Nadal would not be Nadal if he wasn't a lefty.  Mack, who I know was on the show recently, wouldn't be Mack if he wasn't a lefty.  We definitely have an advantage.  Do you guys play tennis?  Hell no.  It's a girl sport.  Oh.  And I'm going to throw this out at you.  Yeah.  I've been talking to some pros.  Remember, there's been some battle of the sexes.  We had Bobby Riggs against Billie Jean, which was rigged.  They say that now.  You can start to say it was rigged. 
[02:41:30]  Writing a book about it?  He lost on purpose.  We had...  Because of gambling debts.  Jimmy beat Martina.  When did that go down?  That was the second battle of the sexes.  Why doesn't anyone talk about the second battle of the sexes?  And the third one, His Highness wants to organize.  Oh, nice.  And I'm proposing Serena Williams.  Oh, boy.  So you always have a current player against a retired men's player.  I'm proposing Serena against Pete Sampras.  And I'm asking your callers who's going to win that one.  Pete Sampras in his form today against Serena today. 
[02:42:00]  Who wins that?  I would have to go with Serena.  Yeah, I would have to go with Serena on that one.  I would have to go with...  I don't really give a fuck.  But if you need an answer, Serena, sure.  And Jim?  Probably Serena.  You find Serena attractive, right?  We're always on a different page.  I'm saying Sampras, 6-love, 6-1.  Really?  6-love, 6-walk.  Yeah, I think it's no contest.  6-love, 6-1.  And I'll tell you why.  You could take...  How old is Sampras?  Sampras, I don't know, he's about 80 years old now.  How old is the dude?  No, I'm kidding.  He must be about 42. 
[02:42:30]  I would guess around 42.  Sounds about right.  41.  Yeah, he would kick her ass, I guess, if you want to realize that.  You could take the top men's...  Because he's probably still playing a lot.  Yeah, just to stay in shape and shit, right?  Let's see a picture of Pete Sampras.  Let's see if he's got a little gut on him.  But why would you put him...  Why would you have him beating her?  Because he's only 41, 42.  Like, Bobby Riggs was what?  50-something?  Yeah, he was 6 or something?  He was old.  He was a mess, yeah.  And he...  Oh, boy.  He was post-Viagra.  What happened to Sampras' nice hair?  Wow. 
[02:43:00]  Damn.  Looks like it ran away.  So how's life, guys?  What's going on?  It looks like I haven't missed a beat here in two years.  I haven't seen you guys.  We asked you what you're doing, and you said you play tennis.  I told you I'm playing a lot of tennis.  And he's got a bag of books.  Why do you got a bag of books?  Because nobody reads the books that comes in here from your publicists who bring on the  guests.  Right.  They're just sitting in the office.  So I grabbed them all.  They're collecting dust.  I love to read.  I read about two, three books. 
[02:43:30]  Show us what you grabbed.  Make a quick pile and find it.  We have Pierce Morgan, who, you know, all these guys seem to have a ghostwriter attached  to these books.  Yeah, you write your own stuff.  You know, Tom Sizemore.  Yeah.  Who's the best one?  George St. Pierre, fellow Canadian.  I heard he's a bit of a dick, actually.  Yeah, he's a nice guy.  How was he on the show here, St. Pierre?  I miss that day.  He's mellow.  He's fine.  We were to Rousey after him or before him.  All right.  And what else?  This one, Cracked.  Cracked Magazine. 
[02:44:00]  There's a lot of funny stuff in here.  Cracked Magazine.  Yeah.  They did a book.  Now, Dr. J, I understand he's coming in.  He's coming back.  Maybe tomorrow, I think.  Is it tomorrow?  I think so.  Apparently, he had a daughter who played tennis.  Yeah, that's right.  I know that.  Fantastic.  Supposedly, she was pretty good.  And they were estranged for years, and then he hooked up with her again, and he did the  honorable thing and became a dad.  Wait, when did this come in?  We have to read this for tomorrow?  When was the last time you read a book for one of the guests? 
[02:44:30]  Oh, Jimmy Reed's been on.  I read them.  You read them?  Oh, yeah.  Jimmy does.  I'll read what I can.  Wait, is that the Dr. J book and old book?  Dude, what type of diet are you on?  You look fantastic.  Look, what are you doing?  He's amazing.  I've just been eating blueberries.  This is Mr. Blueberry Face.  What are you doing?  The cold-pressed juice diet or something?  No, I'm just eating.  Going to the gym and eating butter in general.  Which gym do you go to in New York?  Give him a plug.  No, in my building, let's just say.  I go to a separate gym.  Are you doing yoga or something, too?  No, I'm not doing it.  Just gym.  Cardio?  Oh, my God.  A little cardio.  I do usually four or five days in the gym with trainers a week. 
[02:45:00]  Because with all due respect, he looks in the best shape other than the three of you.  All right.  Especially below the waist.  You two look like you haven't been hitting the gym recently.  I hit the gym, sir.  You do?  Get the fuck out of here.  I'm an animal.  Look at Anthony's guns.  That's true.  I'm an animal.  You're already aggravating the listeners.  I can't wait to go to the phones.  Oh, yeah.  Here we go.  Hold on.  What other books?  You got the Dr. Jim?  Paddle your own canoe.  How was this dude?  Nick Offerman was really cool.  He's the mustache guy from Parks and Rec.  Right.  He got a mustache.  It looked all crazy.  Who's been the best guest you've had on in the two years since... 
[02:45:30]  Ozzy Osbourne.  Has Jesse Ventura been back?  You know what?  No, he hasn't been back in a while.  Because that was a classic, Jimmy and Jesse Ventura.  He's one of the best we've had on because he's such an asshole.  Tyson.  Yep.  That was my answer, too.  Mike Tyson was amazing.  He's a nice guy.  Although one of his appearances was mellow.  He's done three now.  He's done two amazing and one just kind of mellow.  And the day he was mellow, his wife was in studio.  Yeah.  So I see what's going on there.  But he was also, don't forget, still active in his addiction then, which he finally came 
[02:46:00]  out with.  I can't wait to get his book and read it, man.  Oh, that's right.  I want to ask him about that.  And recently, Tim Conway is amazing.  Tim fucking Conway.  I thought he was staring at wood, Tim Conway.  Is he still around?  Oh, yeah.  That's a good name.  Hey, this is Timmy Woodstarrer.  He's looking at wood.  He'll be 80 in December.  And he was great on the show.  And he's going to be on our podcast next week.  By the way, I should mention this week it's Neil deGrasse, right?  He was amazing.  Neil deGrasse Tyson. 
[02:46:30]  Another one.  We figured out the fucking universe with this guy, and it's on our podcast that you  could get today.  So please go and do that.  The Opie and Anthony podcast comes out every Wednesday, and that's what you got this week.  All right?  And then people are requesting Conway already, so it'll be on next Wednesday's podcast.  Anyway, that's not important to Ian.  I heard the show got very big since I've been gone.  Well?  Our show?  Yeah.  Huge.  I think we have a few more listeners.  It depends who you talk to.  I think we have a few more listeners.  Yeah.  Some people think we're complete failures, and others think we're actually moving. 
[02:47:00]  From what I hear, you guys have been making a lot of noise.  Word on the street?  Yeah, definitely.  Definitely.  I think you're bigger and better than before.  Right.  And now the show's gone completely downhill since I'm on.  I was going to say, what's the difference?  And one is that you haven't been here in a while.  What about Sam over here?  I mean, he looks like he just got circumcised or something.  Well, that's probably, you know.  Yeah, it looks like they cut a little bit off his schmeckle.  It's like, yeah, he looks like schmeckle, this guy. 
[02:47:30]  He looks like I'm on a funeral parlor, and, you know, the corpse is semi-alive.  Dude, when was the last time you took a vacation?  That's probably the biggest change since you've been here.  Our own Sam Roberts went from lowly, you know, a little office boy to now a professional  broadcaster.  That's true.  He's got shows on all these channels.  Well, he works hard.  He works hard.  He works hard, which, you know, that kind of is the excuse for his lackluster appearance.  Do you have seven figures in the bank?  No, I'm getting there.  That's good. 
[02:48:00]  He's married, has a lovely wife.  Seven.  Beautiful wife.  You only have sevens.  I'm working on five.  Five's not bad.  Five figures?  Yeah.  Uh, yeah.  Not quite there yet.  Ian, people...  Do you think you'll ever be a superstar?  Like Stern, like Opie and Anthony?  I mean, Stern, Opie and Anthony, they're synonymous.  They're radio legends.  Oh, yeah.  You should be kissing their feet every fucking time you come into this studio.  That's right.  Your name ought to be Tootsie Kisser.  Oh, God.  You know, I was playing tennis the other day, and guess who's on the next court? 
[02:48:30]  Let me guess.  Let me guess.  Oh.  A-Rod.  Yeah, right next to me.  And my perception of him changed.  Why?  I saw him with his daughters, and Cynthia was there, too.  Just the four of them.  Who was with him?  Cynthia.  Oh, okay.  And his two kids.  Who's Cynthia?  His ex?  His ex.  And I gotta say, kudos to A-Rod.  I've never seen a guy better with kids.  Yeah.  He was fantastic.  Hey, wait a minute.  I fucking...  I'm good with him.  The only time I ever played tennis, it was this fucking guy, Milos, and he made me... 
[02:49:00]  Who, the Canadian?  No, he was a fucking Russian guy.  I think he was Russian.  Okay.  Yeah.  And he wanted to impress his chick on the fucking court.  So he, like, asked me, you know, Anthony, could you please, you know, make it look like  I am good at tennis?  But then, as I helped him, the guy's bad-mouthing me, like, oh, look, it was a little girl.  Look, you're going to cry, baby?  So I just fucking, like, fucking power-served him.  Never trust a gay Russian.  Right down his fucking throat.  No, no, no. 
[02:49:30]  He's trying to impress his chick.  Send him back to Siberia.  Give him a good lunch there.  I could have fucked this chick.  I could have fucked this chick.  Well, Russian chicks are hot.  Have you ever banged a Russian chick?  Um, hmm, let me see.  Yeah, she's always in a hurry.  Fucking A, Chippa.  Chippa, you are the best.  Double borscht.  We got a guy on the line that wants to ask you about something you said last time you were  on our show.  What?  It's fair enough.  How can I remember that?  I'm practically suffering from, uh...  Ian.  Yes, yes.  Listen to Jason. 
[02:50:00]  From Indy.  Ian, I want to call you a name, but I really need the answer to this question, so I'm going  to wait, so, last time you were on the show, you said there's some horrible disease sweeping  Hollywood.  It's worse than AIDS.  It's going to start killing everybody.  What the hell?  I haven't heard one thing about this.  You haven't...  Actually, there was a disease sweeping Hollywood, sweeping parts of the U.S. shortly after.  I guess they controlled it, but Google it, man.  Google it.  Google it.  Google it. 
[02:50:30]  Listen, get his own catchphrases out here and get her done.  Google it.  How have you been?  Where have you been?  You sound more sexually frustrated, more depressed, you know, with all due respect to you.  Google it.  The only thing I find is Ian's a fucking mongoloid.  You know what?  You should only live like this mongoloid one day of your life, and God bless.  I wish you all the best.  Sweeping Hollywood, you bitch.  How are things with the ladies? 
[02:51:00]  They're always good.  I like hearing about your sexploits.  No, there's no more sexploits.  What?  Are we married?  I'm practicing serial monogamy.  You go gay?  What happened?  Sex with serial?  Hi, Chip.  That's a good one, Chip.  Hold on, Chip.  Whoa, he's got a girlfriend.  You got a girlfriend, Chip?  I have a girlfriend.  Yeah, what's that about?  How long?  She's a lawyer, and, you know, I'm very serious and just leading a low-key life.  You know, that's...  You're not uncovering anything these days?  Yeah, I'm working on a TV show.  It's called House Guest. 
[02:51:30]  Every week I stay with a different family.  I just came back from England.  I shot there.  I stayed with a professional roller derby player.  Just the word yourself was in there.  Her husband...  Her husband's a clinical psychologist, and by the end of my stay, they split.  Wow, what happened?  You fucking...  She was like, you can't fucking compete with His Highness.  Well, no, I didn't bang her.  Again, I'm practicing serial monogamy these days.  What are you dating? 
[02:52:00]  I made them realize they weren't compatible.  We got it the first time, Chip.  They weren't compatible.  But tell me how the show goes down.  You go away with them for how long?  A week.  I stay with them for a week.  And then what do you do?  Cameras are all over the place.  So you're going to work with the people?  And I just infiltrate their zone.  I try to make them self-disclose, realize their purpose in life.  Yeah, what are you, like a fucking life coach in there?  Yeah, you know, I'm like Anthony Robbins on steroids.  This could be your first good idea.  I like this one.  Yeah, it's fun. 
[02:52:30]  It's fun.  This is a good idea.  Very cool.  And where do you sleep?  I sleep in their house.  Wait, Sam what?  Guest room.  Sam.  This says that it shot in February 2012.  What?  Well, we've been shooting.  No, we started shooting.  Oh, shit.  And we've been shooting two years.  Two years?  Two years.  What fucking reality show?  Their turnaround is like a week on reality shows.  Well, we do a lot of shows.  Oh, okay.  You want to get like fucking eight seasons in the can before you roll out that first episode.  Oh, we've been rolling out. 
[02:53:00]  All right.  Okay.  When is it going to hit TV so we can watch this?  It won't hit TV.  We're doing our own channel.  Oh, I got you.  And it's going to be pay-as-you-go.  What channel?  His Highness channel.  No, YouTube.  His Highness channel.  My own channel.  My own channel.  Well, what's your own channel?  When do you want to promote your own channel?  Sam, you don't.  Well, I mean, the only thing is because you shot in February 2012.  Right.  And now that's almost.  Yeah, we're pushing a year in.  Two years.  Nine months at least, right?  Yeah.  Nine months.  We're still shooting. 
[02:53:30]  Still shooting.  And it's going to be on your own channel, but you don't really want to promote it even  though we're big radio stars.  I will promote it when we're ready to roll out.  We're not ready.  Is there a possibility that you shot it in February 2012 and then things didn't really happen  with it and it's actually not going to happen?  No, no.  You know, when I do something, Roberts, unlike yourself, with all due respect, I do it to  the max.  I don't do anything second rate.  I do it to the best I can and top notch.  Our phones went out and we need our phones for the year.  Oh, my God. 
[02:54:00]  That's always your second rate.  They might be back.  Yeah, yeah.  You don't do anything second rate.  No.  What book are you working on?  Anything?  Yeah, it's a book about hockey players and it's called Dirty Play.  Oh, cool.  And I've interviewed several hundred people for this.  How do you interview several hundred people?  We've been on for years and we haven't interviewed several hundred.  Well, you know, I've worked very hard.  Whatever happened to your Lady Gaga project?  Oh, shit.  Well, that rolled out.  That did very well.  Sold all over the world.  Could you look up the Lady Gaga project?  Chasing Gaga.  Chasing Gaga. 
[02:54:30]  Okay, here's a Chasing Gaga watch party.  Oh, it aired on the TV Guide channel.  Okay.  And is there like a trailer or a clip we could play?  Yeah, play a clip.  Yeah.  Chasing Gaga.  I would like to see some of those.  Now you're going with the hockey players.  Hockey's big in Canada, my friend.  I don't think I've got to tell you.  You would have been able to interview hundreds of people if you did it to the max.  Good point.  Yeah.  Yeah, what did a Frank and a Bill get there?  Do you ever...  Robert's, you know, for a guy with a small dick, you certainly have a big...  Whoa.  Seriously.  Do you ever relax Ian or are you always working? 
[02:55:00]  What do you do?  No, I'm not always working.  I'm very selective in what I get involved in.  You kick back?  Absolutely.  What do you do?  Where do you go?  Where do you go to relax?  What do you do?  I play tennis.  Yeah, but you mean...  Tennis is my yoga.  Is it?  Some guys do yoga.  Not only a master songwriter and keyboard player, Gaga has staged some of the most significant...  Is that you?  Of course it is.  Yeah.  My name is Ian Halperin, award-winning celebrity journalist and author.  Oh, you shouldn't say that about yourself.  I've covered Hollywood's biggest stars, including Michael Jackson, Princess Diana, and Elizabeth 
[02:55:30]  Taylor.  But few have had the 80-year-old rise of Lady Gaga.  I interviewed...  Like a fucking vulture.  ...to Gaga since her career took off to get the story...  All right, this seems like...  I like it.  It's legit.  It is legit.  They didn't play it in America, but...  It did play in America.  You don't really need a market like America.  I can get that somewhere, right?  We sold it all over the world.  Oh, it's on YouTube?  Yeah, we'll watch it on YouTube.  You know what I love?  I love that goddamn Apple TV.  I put stuff on YouTube on my phone, and I just go, Apple TV, and there it is on my 90-inch  fucking TV in my goddamn fucking living room. 
[02:56:00]  I'm watching anything.  It's fantastic.  You know?  Like a movie screen.  Yeah, it's great.  Exactly.  Wow.  Jimmy will not let it go.  You know, Anthony, I agree with you on all this, because we're not at the mercy of all  the big corporations anymore.  You know what?  We can take it into our own hands and make money.  Last night, a little story.  I want to watch Gladiator.  Out of nowhere, I just, you know, I like that movie.  I think it's one of the few perfect movies out there.  There's not one moment that's bad in that goddamn movie. 
[02:56:30]  So I want to watch it.  So I go to On Demand.  I get it.  And then I realize, when they come out, and that guy's swinging, whoosh, whoosh, the  mace around, and he smacks that guy in the head, and his teeth and blood go fine.  No teeth, no blood.  What?  What the fuck?  They took that out of the movie?  So I look, and it says, Gladiator, remastered.  Oh, Christ.  I don't know what the fuck that means.  And it's On Demand.  So it's fucking remastered.  So I'm like, son of a bitch.  Netflix, bam.  Nothing.  Nothing there.  Why would I do that?  I'm searching all over the place.  But then I finally found a DVD in my house. 
[02:57:00]  The moral of the story is, you don't have to put up with the man anymore.  I don't know why they did that.  And I noticed right away.  I'm like, I remember that.  It was right after the guy pisses his fucking pants, and the door opens, and the guy gets  smacked in the head with the fucking mace.  You know what?  And they cut out the fucking blood in Gladiator.  It's the whole point.  You know what, man?  All of us are thinking about throwing our DVDs away.  You know, you've got to keep the DVDs. 
[02:57:30]  You never know.  Because they're going to remaster all this shit.  Yeah.  Eventually.  Yep.  So keep your DVDs if you want to see the original version of the movie.  And of course, I have three giant stacks of DVDs in the plastic cases.  Right.  Where do you think Gladiator was?  The bottom of the last one I fucking checked.  Isn't that always the case?  I'm fucking tooling through.  There's the Matrix.  There's fucking Terminator.  There's Alien.  I'm fucking flipping discs all over the place.  I don't know why you...  Little Beavis is batting him around the house. 
[02:58:00]  Like, knock it off.  Here's my vocabulary, by the way, when I'm home alone.  No, Beavis, no!  Beavis, get down!  Be- ow!  Ow!  No, Beavis!  No!  Stop it!  It's not as fun.  I am yelling constantly at my little cat.  The terrible twos for your fucking kitten already.  Right?  Ian knows.  Terrible twos, right, Ian?  He does it.  From 2 to 17, right?  Well, you know what?  I think the first four years are tough because the kids are falling all over the place. 
[02:58:30]  You get all nervous.  Muscular dystrophy is a bitch.  Cakewalk.  Put stuff in their milk makes them tired.  How was Montreal, Anthony?  I know you were up in Montreal.  I enjoyed.  I heard you were a big hit there.  You hosted a gala, and they loved you.  It was a lot.  It was so much fun, and the people up there were wonderful.  Delightful.  The city is great.  It's hot on the streets.  It's clean.  There's no gibberish.  No gibberish on the street corners. 
[02:59:00]  So you're a fan.  What do you mean in this French and English?  Big fan.  I don't mean that.  Speaking both languages, very proper.  Not like fucking here.  Walk down the street.  Did they treat you well?  They like fucking gold.  Please, thank you.  As the bartenders were fucking courteous.  Oh, appreciative.  I loved it.  And the chicks?  How were the chicks?  Smoking hot, Ian Halperin.  Smoking hot.  Canadian broads.  Look at Ian.  They are.  They are.  I love it.  You're not going to get any complaints out of me.  So you're going to go back next summer? 
[02:59:30]  I would love to go back next summer.  Yeah, you guys are big in Canada.  I know we are.  Huge.  Love it.  We know.  That's why we went.  People are beating down doors to get into the show.  Ian, we've got to go to the phones.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Michael in Manhattan.  No more guys.  No more guys.  Because all the guys.  I need women.  They're just haters.  No more guys.  Sorry, guys.  Jealous haters, Ian.  Yeah.  The phones aren't working.  Remember when I said that a little while ago?  Mars is right on it.  They're still not working.  Oh, that's right.  I haven't seen it.  Hey, Ian, why are you here today?  I'm confused.  I have to say hi to you guys. 
[03:00:00]  I'm in town shooting an episode of Houseguest, and I have to come say hi to you guys.  Another episode of Houseguest.  How many seasons do you have in the can?  I'm going to do about 15 episodes, and it's pay as you go, and that's it.  Nice.  What?  And no checks made out to Sam Roberts.  I mean, he's making a lot of paper.  You know, if Sam Roberts was homeless, I'd probably pass him by, you know, with all due  respect.  Why is that?  Because, dude, you look like a corpse. 
[03:00:30]  You need to get a tan.  Yeah, but if I was homeless, that wouldn't be that weird.  You look miserable, bro.  Miserable since I've seen you last night.  How's marriage?  I see a ring that's still on your finger.  Muzzletop.  Marriage is good.  It's good?  Michael, did you marry her last night?  I did, as a matter of fact.  He married so far out of his league, it's ridiculous.  That's Volker talker.  His wife is very cute.  I'm very excited that I'm going to see Jess this Friday at my big Halloween gala.  Yeah.  Hopefully she dresses up as a woman who murdered her husband. 
[03:01:00]  Are you coming to Ann's party on Friday?  Yeah, you're invited.  I'm going to be in town.  I'm going to be in town.  Oh, shit.  I was going to invite you.  Thank you, Anthony.  Michael in Manhattan wants to say something to Ian Halpern.  Hey, Ian, you fucking moron.  Oh, man, that's all due respect.  I mean, you're like a human parrot.  That's all you said.  Why is that?  Why they?  Was it always like this?  Why all the testosterone?  Why all the jealousy, the hatred?  It's a beautiful day in New York.  You're a nothing, man. 
[03:01:30]  I'm not asking for your approval.  You know, the only approval I need is for my own family, dude.  You're not mishpochah.  You know, what is it?  Don't give me the Yiddish.  The Yiddish is crap.  Are you an anti-Semite?  I'm an anti-Semite.  You don't like Jews, right?  Let me explain something to you.  Would you bang Al Sharpton?  You're the type of person who creates himself up, okay?  Jerk off into a fucking mirror.  Dude, I ain't jerking off.  Dude, get a life, you miserable zero.  You're a zero, dude. 
[03:02:00]  You're still doing the same fucking bullshit two years later.  Get a life.  What are you doing with your life, you mooch?  Showtime.  Come on, get him off the line.  Get him off.  He's a mooch.  He's a zero.  Enough of him.  Let me tell you something.  I'm sorry, Mike.  I know Ian hasn't been here in a while, but I don't recall.  Were the callers always like this?  No, they usually are pretty nice.  I get all these tweets.  Please come back on the show.  Come back on the show.  So I'm back.  But what a homecoming. 
[03:02:30]  You know, there's everyone that wants you back, and that's the millions of people.  They're just listening and enjoying at home.  That's it.  The haters, which is just a small portion of the audience.  The vocal minority is what it is.  They're the one calling.  And he's rocking the frosted hair, I see.  Yeah, I see that.  Looks good.  Making it work, Ian.  It's pretty good.  Making it work.  It's all showbiz.  It's showtime.  It's all showbiz.  Ian looks showbiz.  I wanted to be a cross between yourself and Anthony.  Thank you.  Oh, Christ.  We got Tim in New York.  Ian in New York.  I'm going to prove that the listeners could be tied to you. 
[03:03:00]  Not one-sided?  Right.  Of course not.  Tim, go ahead.  Hey, I was wondering if Ian's show is actually called Bathhouse Guest.  Oh, jeez.  You know, your jokes are so old.  I was surprised by that one.  He's so old.  At least give fresh, good jokes.  Right.  I mean, gay men go to bathhouses.  I'm the guy who harps off the corpses of Michael Jackson, Liz Taylor, and Princess Di.  Oh, I love Liz Taylor.  I love Liz Taylor.  May she rest in peace.  Would you do her?  Yes.  In her current state? 
[03:03:30]  Absolutely.  In her current state.  All right.  I can respect you now.  I wouldn't do Conrad Murray.  I'm really upset that he's out of jail.  Oh, yes.  He got off two years early.  That is.  He got out.  I think he banged somebody in the prison, and they let him out early.  I can't think.  There's no other reason for this dude to get out so early.  Did you hear his crying tapes?  His voicemails, or his crying and leaving people voicemails?  And then it seems like he just went in, and now he's out.  I'm sure it probably seemed longer for him than it did for us here on the outside not paying attention to him. 
[03:04:00]  Considering he killed the King of Pop, I think it's reasonable to do two years.  Right, right, right.  Exactly.  Two years.  Wow.  Killing, you know.  The hell is that about it?  It doesn't make sense.  Influential musician.  Doug in Boston.  He's a regular.  I'm sure he'll treat you with some respect.  Doug.  Hey.  Go ahead, Doug.  Hey, listen.  I don't have a problem with Ian.  I don't even know him.  But we do have a mutual friend who I called him earlier to say, hey, Ian's going to be on O&A.  He's like, well, here, you've got to bring this up, okay?  You've got to ask Ian about his friend, Stick, who lives in Montreal, who has a book called My Dirty Clothes. 
[03:04:30]  And apparently the story is, Ian decided to register the domain name, My Dirty Clothes, behind his friend's back.  Oh.  What you're saying is libelous, what's false, and get a life, dude.  Don't make false accusations, because you might have his highness's lawyers taking away your home.  Oh, shit.  That sounded like a juicy piece of gossip.  I've got one more thing, too.  Okay, so Mark, oh, I'm sorry.  My friend also says that Ian has a thing for Russian hookers, and most of the money from his Michael Jackson book was spent on Russian hookers. 
[03:05:00]  Ian, comment?  Is that true, Ian?  Get this guy's number, and I'll have my lawyer's contact.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, this is a...  You know, you can't make statements like that.  Unheard of.  It's all jealousy, and...  You do love the Russian chicks, though.  Although, to pump up the Russian, you did kind of implicate yourself by that whole Russian thing we mentioned before.  Yeah, and then he just picked up on it, and, you know, it's easy to make it.  That is true, that is true.  You know. 
[03:05:30]  Yes, yes.  Let me try another one here.  Vinny in Staten Island, another regular to the show.  Vinny.  Gentlemen, earlier in the week we talked, fuck Lou Reed, fuck Radiohead, fuck Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, and most importantly, fuck you, Ian Alvarez.  Oh, wow.  You're being lumped in with some great people there.  Ian, you're a great company right there.  He put you in, I don't know if that was a compliment.  Hey, Lou Reed, that's a big loss, and may he rest in peace.  Why is he a big Velvet Underground fan, and I was very upset to hear about Lou Reed's dad.  You're a big fan?  Huge. 
[03:06:00]  I think Lou Reed really reinvented...  Dirty boulevard, we're going down...  Nice, right?  To the dirty boulevard, we're going...  What a voice on him.  That's right.  Was Lou ever on the show?  No.  No.  But, Ian, you're a singer.  Yeah.  I've heard you croon before.  Well, can we hear him croon?  I don't know.  Can we?  You're a songster.  Just to prove that you're a crooner before Ian makes his point.  But I've heard him sing.  I'll sing you one of mine.  Okay.  Alright.  Going low, going high, and I'm feeling so nice. 
[03:06:30]  I'm driving in the Norway road.  There you go.  It's right on key.  Now, you've got a guy like Lou Reed who gets all these accolades.  The guy couldn't sing a note.  Let's be real here.  So, you know, there are Rod Stewart, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, but these guys are icons.  I don't mean the raspy throat thing.  You know, you listen to Rod Stewart, he's hitting the notes that he's supposed to hit when he sings. 
[03:07:00]  Lou Reed is just kind of talking his way through these.  And if you listen to a lot of his songs, they don't even rhyme.  Yeah.  Fucking, he's just babbling and talking, making a song rhyme as a talent.  But that's what gives him his own voice.  With all due respect.  Look, I will never denigrate another artist in any shape or form.  You can fart in a CD, put it out.  I'm not going to trash him.  What do I say?  Put it all out there.  Let the people judge.  But I admire anybody with the courage to express themselves. 
[03:07:30]  You're a humble man.  Let's go to Garrett in Philly.  Garrett.  Garrett, Ian, you're a fraud, and I have proof of it.  Ooh.  Yeah, right.  Be careful, man.  He's got powerful lawyers.  Fucking lawyers will be right on there.  That's right.  Ian, I have a video.  Slap an injunction on him.  Yes?  Listen, I have a video of you on my cell phone of you crying at JFK International Airport  two weeks ago outside the Burger King.  Do you recall this?  Is that true, Ian?  You were crying outside the Burger King?  What did they get you? 
[03:08:00]  Let's go to the next caller.  Because, you know, what are we going to do here?  Did they get your order wrong?  Why would you be crying outside the Burger King?  Yeah, what's he talking about?  They didn't have the healthy fries?  You were on the phone.  He was on the phone when he was crying.  I had a video.  Yeah.  Well, what was it about?  Maybe it was a personal issue.  You're right, Ian?  I'm fine.  Did they not hold the pickle or the lettuce?  All right, let's move on.  Special orders.  You're supposed to be able to do it.  Come on, let's have some substance and let's have some fun.  Well, why were you crying?  What was the matter? 
[03:08:30]  I mean, I've cried.  I've cried.  I've watched the same movies.  I'm just not going to buy into any of this.  They didn't give you a cardboard crown?  I'll email the video to you guys.  What email address should I send you?  Yeah, please email it.  You got video?  Yeah, I will email it to you guys.  Please do.  Was it bawling, pissy-eyed crying, or just a little weepy?  Yeah, that's good.  It was weepy, but he definitely was not okay.  What's your email, Sam?  I mean, I think this guy's lying.  I don't believe him.  Uh-oh, Ian.  What happened?  You can send it to opianthony at SiriusXM.com.  Why didn't you go up to him and go, hey, you're Ian Halpern? 
[03:09:00]  Because he's literally a mess and he's a creep.  All right.  Heads are crap.  All right, he's going to mail that in.  Let me say hi to Steve in Montreal.  You were just talking about Montreal.  Here you go.  This is perfect.  A fellow Canadian.  Nice.  Great scene.  A brother of country.  Good morning, Steve.  How are you guys doing?  All right.  Steve A.  Hey, Ian, I got a question for you.  You intended a lawsuit against Guy Aletage a couple years back on his show that you were 
[03:09:30]  on, Tout le monde en parle.  Yeah.  I was curious to find out what happened with that.  And by the way, you were wrong to sue him.  Oh.  You know, I'm not going to comment on anything legal.  What I will say, I went on the show.  Yep.  What show, Ian?  I didn't hear what you said.  It's a show up in Canada called Tout le monde en parle.  Okay.  What does that mean?  So, everybody speaks.  You speak French?  Dumb fucker.  But, you know, I'm not going to talk about it. 
[03:10:00]  I respect Guy Lepage.  It wasn't about him.  It was about another guy on the show.  And we settled it, and that's it.  Game over.  And I'm not going to talk about anything.  What did the guy do?  You don't have to, like, get into the details.  There were some remarks made about, I was on the show the day of Yom HaShoah, which  is Holocaust Remembrance Day.  Oh, shit.  And my father's a Holocaust survivor.  Oh, man.  For real. 
[03:10:30]  And there was some anti-Jewish remarks, man.  I have a grandfather.  I've got the grandfather that died in a concentration camp.  Don't say it.  He fell out of the guard tower.  Get it?  See, he was a Nazi.  He was a guard that was there to protect the Nazis.  May he rest in peace.  So, what happened with this Holocaust day?  Well, there were some derogatory statements made, but we settled it, so I'm not going  to comment on it.  No, on his part, obviously. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  We've got Anthony's.  He's probably not as sympathetic to the Jewish cause as an Ian Halperin would be.  We've got Anthony's brother.  A fellow member of the tribe.  Anthony's brother?  Yes, Joe.  What's up, guys?  How are you?  For real, this is Joe.  I just have two things to plug.  Oh, my God.  We're in the middle of...  No, come on.  I never call him for plugs.  But the first thing is Hagerstown, Maryland, to you at the Hagerstown Theater, the Maryland  Theater in Hagerstown.  You didn't hang up on me.  I know you didn't hang up on me.  No, I'm car crashing you because we're in the middle of a fine interview with Ian Halperin. 
[03:11:30]  I have a question.  I have a question for Ian.  I just wanted to plug a couple of things.  Oh, okay.  All right.  And the other thing was fundanything.com, Penn Jillette, his movie director's cut.  I know he's coming on the show soon.  I just wanted to mention the fact that I turned in a couple of song possibilities for the soundtrack up on YouTube.  And, Ian, who are you and what do you do?  Oh, no. 
[03:12:00]  I used to be a regular on the O&A show.  And I've had a two-year hiatus, and I'm back on the show.  I'm a big fan of these guys.  Thank you, Ian.  We're big fans of you.  You know that.  Absolutely.  It's great to be here.  Great to see you guys.  I have a lot of respect.  This is a different Ian Halperin.  Well, it is.  He's a taken man.  Poor subdued.  I like the wild party guy who comes in with the brats.  Those days are gone.  Remember when you came in with those chicks?  Remember the chicks that you rented for the day? 
[03:12:30]  Craigslist, you know.  I could have got better models probably on the corner of Broadway in 42nd.  But you know what?  You had them.  They were up here.  They were here.  Let me tell you something.  A friend of mine went on Arsenio Hall two weeks ago.  Okay.  And some comedian brought her on.  And she was paid as a member of the audience to pop out.  Oh, shit.  So, you know, they either stole from me or I stole from them.  Wow.  Will Arsenio last this time around? 
[03:13:00]  No.  It doesn't seem like anyone's talking about it.  No one.  I don't even know what the ratings are.  Zero heat.  He seems to do very well at first because I like a talk show that...  Yeah, there doesn't seem to be any body wash.  I'm just talking over him now.  Is he here for a cup of coffee?  Yeah, he's...  And what he's doing, it's exactly the same thing he was doing in the 90s.  So, he hasn't changed anything.  He hasn't updated it.  And the only thing is, he's a little more out of touch now than he was, you know, when 
[03:13:30]  he was a hip black guy.  I honestly don't hear people talking about it.  None.  I don't know.  He might be doing well in the ratings.  I just don't know.  I don't think he is.  I watched Pete Holmes' new show.  How's that?  I liked it.  Pete the Wad Holmes?  Pete Holmes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I liked him.  Yeah, I think that's a good follow-up to Conan.  Yeah, he's on after Conan on TBS.  They had their first show the other day.  You know who's writing for that show?  Joey.  Joey DeRosa.  Sorry, Pete.  Oh, what happened?  I'm saying because Joe's writing for you.  Oh.  The Wolverine sketch he did to start it all off was pretty good. 
[03:14:00]  Very clever.  Yeah.  Well written.  Yeah, I liked it.  Very nice.  So far, so good for Pete Holmes.  Was it a half hour or an hour?  Half hour.  Oh, I have it, thanks a lot.  Is it a half hour?  I think it is.  Wow, that went by.  And how's Fallon going to do in New York?  We love the Fallon.  He'll do great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, him and Kimmel are great with social media and with what's current and in the pop culture.  They're both really good with that, so I think we're fine.  Are you going to be a regular on his show?  If you have me, of course.  I've done Fallon before. 
[03:14:30]  It's great.  Yeah.  I think we're team Fallon on this one.  Yeah, I think he'll do well.  Although they're both very good.  I'm not trashing Kimmel, but Fallon's been very cool to us over the years.  I think it's a good move to move the show here.  Well, it's hard to say because it's good for Kimmel because he'll be the only L.A. guy  at 1130.  With Jay's going off the air and fucking, you know, with Fallon staying here, Kimmel's  got the L.A. thing sewn up.  And that's why Carson eventually moved to L.A.  Yeah, I wonder how it'll affect guests.  He'll get great ones in New York. 
[03:15:00]  Maybe they figure there's more New York guys, but I think you're going to get Kimmel getting  more first movie stars because of where he is.  But do you think there's room for all these guys late night?  It seems there's way too many right now.  It's a bit crowded room.  A bit crowded.  There's so many.  We haven't even talked about Chelsea Handler.  I mean, all these people are coming out with late night shows, and I think some of them  are going to have to disappear.  Well, the amount of channels that there are these days, and, you know, you can pop shows  on everywhere.  They aren't expecting huge runaway numbers anymore because the audiences are so divided. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah, if you could be, you know, the big fish in the smaller pond, then you're eking out  an existence.  You know, I think Pete Holmes will do pretty good.  What about Ferguson?  Huh?  The brother from fucking Clarissa explains it all?  Yeah, I don't know where he is.  I mean, somebody has to take a hike here.  I like Ferguson, but I don't watch him.  But when I end up watching him, I do enjoy what he does, if that makes any sense.  Who's the best out of all of them? 
[03:16:00]  Which Ferguson do you mean?  I think Letterman.  Turd.  Yes, Turd Ferguson.  I still like Letterman above them all.  Yeah, I agree with you.  You do?  100%.  Wow.  I think Letterman's looking a little old on the TV.  Letterman's in a league of his own.  Still does it.  I was there the day Julianne Moore opened up for you guys.  When you guys were on that show, I was in the audience.  You weren't in the audience.  Yes, I was.  Oh, wait, I think we talked about it.  I was.  Julianne Moore was the first guest.  And then us.  And you guys were second.  You guys had more fans than her. 
[03:16:30]  Julianne Moore.  Outside the studio by the side.  Remember all that?  Outside, there were so many O&A fans.  One and done for us.  I was there with my buddy David Gavrilchuk.  Oh.  He flew into New York.  Did you sue him, too?  I think it's the Letterman.  You're not going to sue us, are you?  No.  You guys are sue-proof.  Don't be such a leap.  I wouldn't want to mess with your lawyers.  You guys are nice guys.  Well, look at what we did to the last guy that sued us.  We set him up as a pedophile going after a seven-year-old.  Only took ten years, but we did it.  We finally got him. 
[03:17:00]  We got him.  We got him back.  Surprised the shit out of him.  Don't fuck with us.  Wow.  You hear about that, Dave Herman?  No.  Rock and Roll Morning Show from WNAW?  I never heard about that, but that's a good one.  They spent a year doing an investigation on him.  It turns out he was soliciting sex from a mother for sexual services of her six-year-old daughter.  At the time.  At the time.  And it took away the key.  It took him a year, but he finally was going to get it. 
[03:17:30]  Oh, after that.  Okay.  And she was seven when she was going to fly this big person.  They caught him waiting for this plane to come in with this imaginary mother and daughter,  but he thought they were real, in St. Croix, because he's got a house down there.  So the police went into the airport where he was waiting, and they got him sitting there in the chair in the terminal with a stuffed animal on his lap.  Poor guy.  He's waiting for this fucking kid to come.  What a piece of shit.  It's like being in a restaurant, and you're ready for your steak, and instead they come over with handcuffs. 
[03:18:00]  That ain't right.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  You're a despicable man.  He had to pay for parking and everything and buy the doll.  That's long-term parking.  Maybe they let Conrad Murray out so he could check in.  Hey, there you go.  Makes himself space for that motherfucker.  That's a lie.  I hear you.  What's, um...  I gotta go.  What?  I got my one-on-one.  Oh, my God, it is.  What's your schedule today?  I got my one-on-one. 
[03:18:30]  I didn't even notice what time it was.  Tim Sabine.  He's trying to do one-on-ones or something.  Let me thank you guys.  It's been nice to see you guys again.  What a pleasure.  Please, don't make yourself a stranger as long as you have.  I'm a big fan of the show.  I could tell you.  We mentioned a few things.  I'm a huge fan.  You guys are legends.  Legends?  Legends in the radio world, for sure.  And you got the right man over here hitting clean-ups.  Oh, please.  Jimmy Norton.  In shape, looking good.  I have so many friends in Canada who are fans of this guy. 
[03:19:00]  Oh, yeah.  So, he's like a rock star up there.  Anywhere.  Ian is forgetting, too, the important thing that you didn't mention.  The Beacon Friday night.  Oh, my God.  The Beacon.  I will be there with ADC.  AC, DC.  I'm also going to be in Albany sometime in November.  Albany.  Yes.  Yeah.  And my advice show I'll be doing next week.  I owe a couple of advice shows.  Because I shot last week and I'm shooting this week.  But I will make up a couple of shows that I missed over the next couple of weeks.  I'll be doing two a week just to cover the ground. 
[03:19:30]  Are you working for advice now?  No, I'm doing advice.  Okay.  Advice show here I do on Wednesday.  Awesome.  People call up and they say, Jimmy, yeah, I want to fuck this broad.  And he tells you, you know, how to do it.  Or, Jimmy, I drink too much.  And he tells you what to do.  I suggest.  Or, Jimmy, my wife wants to have sex with a giant black cock.  Yes.  And I want to watch.  I'll tell you where to find one.  And then he, yeah.  Yes.  But I'm not giving up the advice show.  It's just my shoot schedule has been a little crazy the last couple of weeks.  No worries.  Also, the Opie and Anthony podcast.  The latest one is out today.  Indeed he do. 
[03:20:00]  Neil deGrasse Tyson.  As we figure out the universe.  And I think we did.  I think we figured it all out.  And I'd like to invite his highness, Ian Halperin, to stick around and do After Opie and Anthony.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  That right there is an honor.  Wow.  That right there is like, remember when Carson used to wave a comic over after he did a stand-up set?  Like, he thought he was just going to do stand-up and go backstage again.  And Carson waves him over and sits down with funny stuff, funny stuff.  That is exactly what the After Show is.  That's right.  It's going to be fun. 
[03:20:30]  That's right.  It's the equivalent of fucking Mengele waving you over for a twin test.  Thumbs down on the boxcar.  It would be my honor, sir, if you would do my live read today.  Absolutely.  Jesus Christ.  You sure?  It would be my honor.  He's pawning off.  Is that cool?  Anything for you, Opie.  It's called pawning off.  I would be honored.  Anything for Opie.  I'm not trying to get out anything.  It would just be my honor.  I'd like to be honored.  Nah, but that's always mine.  All right.  Here we go.  This is courtesy of the O&A Show.

[03:25:00]  Shakele calundrums.  No.  What word in the English language is always spelled incorrectly?  Shakele bow.  Oh yeah, and it's not just Sam Roberts today. 
[03:25:30]  No.  With me is the legend, the award-winning entertainment reporter, the man that, quite frankly, the  man that I've shared a bed with.  His Hollywood Highness, Ian Halpern, is still here, hanging out.  How do you think your big return...  I mean, people don't know that.  A lot of people, if you Google image Ian Halpern, Sam Roberts...  We'll come up. 
[03:26:00]  You can find a photo of the two of us.  That's true.  You wearing very little clothes.  Me fully clothed.  That was like two and a half years ago, at least.  Well, that was for you.  You held a bed in.  That's right.  In the...  What hotel was that?  At the War...  I don't know.  It was right around...  It was in this neighborhood.  It was in Midtown.  The Warwick.  Because you held a bed in.  It was the Warwick, right?  It sounds right.  The Warwick Hotel.  Yeah, that was interesting because of my book about Arnold.  Arnold.  And I remember that you called in...  Troy and me went down to report on you live on the scene at the bed in. 
[03:26:30]  Yeah.  It was a creepy scene, to tell you the truth.  I mean, you know, we got there early.  And so it was just me and Troy, and then you and your guy.  And you were kind of just in bed with no clothes on.  And I said, you know, I'm glad Troy's here.  Because I wouldn't want to be here alone.  And Troy climbed in.  He did.  Yeah, Troy took his clothes off and climbed in himself.  But it was...  You know what happened with that book?  What happened?  That was interesting.  That was The Governator, correct?  Yeah, the book originally tanked. 
[03:27:00]  They did a deal with the media that really shut me down.  Who did?  To this day, I presume it was the Shriver camp.  She's much more powerful than Arnold.  Now, is this because this book, The Governator, had all kinds of secrets about Arnold's past?  It had all the sex life in there, everything.  Right.  And then four months later, my phone starts ringing off the hook.  Everybody who, you know, usually when I do a book, I go on Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, Extra, all the big shows. 
[03:27:30]  I mean, the Michael Jackson book put you over the top, didn't it?  Yeah, even before then, I always did the shows.  Your big star.  Not a big star, but, you know, I always worked the media and did all the promo, which you need to sell books.  And any time I was on Howard's show, I mean, Howard and Oprah were very powerful for selling books.  You started book selling?  Absolutely.  And this case, nobody wanted me on, so I held the bed in. 
[03:28:00]  And that really didn't do too much.  No, if I remember correctly, it was me and Troy that showed up, and then some European, like British.  Well, the BBC.  You're talking about the biggest broadcaster in the world.  Not some Europeans.  Look.  You're talking about the biggest broadcaster on the planet.  Well, I don't watch them.  Yeah, well, they are the biggest.  The BBC shows up, and they put out this video.  Yeah.  And we watched it on the show, but the video had your hotel and your room number in the video.  Yeah, and then people started showing up. 
[03:28:30]  I mean, that was pretty unprofessional.  That doesn't seem right at all.  No, that was really...  You talk about the BBC being the biggest thing there is.  You'd think they'd know to blur out the room number.  We got you.  We got you on your...  I was very unimpressed with that, because people did show up after, and...  Plus, they're ordering room service to your room.  Yeah, it was crazy.  It's insanity.  But what happened, in a nutshell, four months later, I got a call.  This was after the bed-in.  Yeah.  Four months go by.  The book tanks.  Everybody and their uncle now wants me on their show because of the news of his son. 
[03:29:00]  Right.  Now, did you know this is when we found out that Arnold had had sex with his housekeeper?  Mildred Baina, her name.  And it had a...  Apparently, is this alleged or factual?  I'm assuming alleged?  I don't know.  Well, this was factual.  Factual, okay.  And had a son by her.  So, was this in the book?  Did you know about this?  It was originally in the book.  Right.  And the publisher took it out for legal.  We kept it a lot.  We kept all his dalliances in there. 
[03:29:30]  You knew this, but you couldn't have it in.  Yes.  Because, you know, any time you write a book, it's vetted by lawyers.  Of course.  So, we had it in.  They take it out.  But everybody knew I had it in.  So, all of a sudden, I have every broadcaster in the world hunting me down, wanting me to  fly to New York, to Los Angeles, to London, to Paris, to Austria, where the governor's from.  Of course.  And I said, dude, we're going to do this on His Highness' terms now, because nobody wanted 
[03:30:00]  me a few months ago.  I made them all show up at a secluded destination.  Why?  Because I wasn't going to do another...  Just to flex your power?  Another roadshow.  No, not to flex my power.  How come it had to be a secluded destination?  Because I wanted to kill everything with one stone.  I do interview after interview.  Gotcha.  A private destination.  Gotcha.  And they all showed up.  And about two months later, this was still going on. 
[03:30:30]  I mean, I was doing extra...  So, did the book end up selling at that point?  We did very well.  Now, do you put your own money into these books?  No.  I mean...  Okay.  So, when a book tanks, it's like...  It makes it tough to do another book, but you're not losing cash.  No.  You get the nice advance.  Yeah, you get the advance.  And we've seen...  I'm sure you've seen many authors fade into oblivion.  Sure.  Especially celebrity journalist authors.  Yeah, of course.  You know, that's a fleeting profession.  Absolutely.  Is it not?  Well, it depends who you are. 
[03:31:00]  I mean, people like myself, Christopher Anderson, Kitty Kelly, we last because we work hard selling books.  Jackie Collins.  Yes.  Are you familiar with Jackie?  Of course.  Have you had her on the show?  No.  You know, she works it more than anybody.  She'll show up at shopping centers.  She'll show up anywhere to sell a book.  You've got to work it.  It's like being a band.  Now, 866-WOW1-WOW is the phone number.  And let's also...  Let's get some chicks on the phone.  I'm only going to talk to chicks.  Oh, and I had you on today. 
[03:31:30]  And a lot of dudes calling up, but we need to prove to Ian that there's some estrogen listening.  Well, first of all, I want to thank Oh, and I...  Yeah, of course.  Um, they're really legends in the radio business, and it was great to be back.  And, uh, how did you think the show went?  I think it went very well.  But I want to know, why have you been gone so long?  Is it because we haven't been inviting you?  Is it because you've been busy?  Uh, no.  Uh, you know, absence makes the heart grow fonder.  This was strategic on your part.  No.  No, not at all.  I just really...  I feel it was strategic on both parts. 
[03:32:00]  We needed a break.  Mm-hmm.  I mean, things were getting a bit heated a couple of years back.  We had a good run.  Yeah.  Uh...  I mean, yeah, you got into some altercations, specifically with Anthony in the past.  Yeah, but Anthony's a great dude.  He is a great dude.  You know, I have a lot of, uh...  I have a profound respect for Anthony.  But you used to call in and mention having sex with his ex-girlfriend a lot.  That's years ago.  I mean, you know...  That was like your thing.  Like, that was your deal.  It was just a joke.  I mean, it was...  Look. 
[03:32:30]  Anthony and I, I think there's a respect there.  I think...  A mutual respect.  This dude has survived for eons in this business.  Eons?  Eons.  Oh.  Do you know how to spell eons?  I-O-N?  Very good.  Nice.  You obviously...  You went to Princeton.  Where did you go to?  Syracuse University.  Good school.  Derek Coleman.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good center for them.  I got a lady on the phone.  Pearl.  Pearl.  Do you know Pearl Washington?  I don't know Pearl Washington.  You don't know who Pearl Washington is?  Do you know Lady Trucker? 
[03:33:00]  No.  Lady Trucker.  You're on with Ian Halpern.  Hey.  You asked for us to get in the call, so I called.  There's a...  Well, first off, where are you calling from, Trucker?  I'm in North Carolina.  What part of North Carolina?  Henderson, North Carolina.  And how's the weather today?  Nice and warm.  It's about 72.  You're having a good time?  No.  Why not?  Are you lonely?  I'm very lonely.  Oh, yeah?  I'm just...  Yeah.  Have you seen photos of Ian Halpern? 
[03:33:30]  No, I'm not available.  I'm not available, but let's play His Highness Date, okay?  I'll be like your J-Day today.  What's your demographic for guys?  First of all, are you into men or women?  Great question.  I'm a dick licker.  She loves licking dicks.  Ian, you have a dick, correct?  Last time I checked.  Do you have a dick?  I do.  You do?  I checked yesterday.  Now, what color is your dick?  It's the same complexion as the rest of my body. 
[03:34:00]  It matches?  Yeah, which is an off-white, I guess.  Yeah.  Because you do look a bit albino.  Yeah, albino.  Has anybody told you that before?  I mean, I guess pasty, pale?  Yeah, a bit.  You need a bit of a vacation, Sam.  You think so?  Yeah.  Where should I go?  You've got a dick.  Somewhere where the sun shines.  Yeah.  Maybe Kingston, Jamaica.  The sun doesn't shine too often in this studio, Ian.  You've been in here.  No, it doesn't.  But you have nice lights.  Yeah.  I mean, you should be getting color from these lights.  Lady, are you with us, lady?  Lady Trucker.  Yes, I'm with you. 
[03:34:30]  All right, first off, what's your demographic, the age?  Do you want a guy 95 plus, 100 million in the bank?  Yeah, do you want an older cock or a nice young one?  A nice young cock.  I'm a cougar.  How old?  Under 30.  Wow, that is a young one.  That's younger than me.  And do you prefer kosher cock?  Do you prefer ghetto cock?  What type of cock do you like?  That's a great question.  Well, I'm a size queen.  Okay, so you're thinking black. 
[03:35:00]  It doesn't have to be black.  It can be Italian, too.  You want a big, fat, young salami, huh?  That's right.  Wow.  And if there's one schlong that you could be compatible with, let me ask you a question.  Let me just get an example, Trucker, of the type of schlong you're looking for.  If I put Lano, if I put LeBron, or Latifah, which one do you take?  Does Queen Latifah have a penis?  I haven't checked. 
[03:35:30]  I would go with Lano.  Lano over LeBron?  Very interesting.  What about Opie over Anthony?  Who do you take there, Opie or Anthony?  Well, Opie's married, so I'd have to go with Anthony because he's got that adorable little  beavis with him.  Have you ever fantasized about Anthony?  Anthony?  No.  Anthony's a little too old for you.  Thank you, Lady Trucker.  I can't talk to Lady Trucker all day.  Lady Trucker is not physically...  Trucker!  Trucker, are you there? 
[03:36:00]  No, she's gone.  She's gone.  She's gone.  Have a good day, Trucker.  Let's go back to the lines.  All right.  Doug in Boston.  We're on the Sam Roberts show.  That's right, Doug.  Host ONA.  Prime time.  Sam Roberts, professional broadcaster.  How are you, buddy?  I'm great.  How are you?  Ian Halpern is here with me.  Yes, I know he is.  Ian and I have a mutual friend who I went to college with.  You have a lot of friends out there, Ian.  Yes.  I'm sorry, but Ian, dude, you are the most self-promoting... 
[03:36:30]  All right.  Let's get rid of this guy.  I'm not going to have any negativity.  You're gone, caller.  Next caller.  And you know what?  And you know what?  Next caller.  If you're going to promote...  Who else is going to promote you if not yourself, right?  Exactly.  All right.  Next caller.  Doug in Boston.  No, no, Doug.  Yeah.  Doug came on before.  He had his chance.  He made libelous statements.  Gone.  Well, it's not libelous to say you're self-promoting.  It's very libelous what he said.  Go off, off, off, or I'm going to walk.  Hang on.  Off, off, off. 
[03:37:00]  Doug, get a life off.  Doug's gone.  I've got to be respectful of Ian Halpern.  He wants to go off.  I am the guest.  Yeah.  You're the guest.  I've invited you into my home.  You've so graciously graced me with your presence.  Well, it's a pleasure to be here, Sam.  And really, all the kidding aside, I'm very proud of what you've done.  I think your career's just going up and up.  And, you know, guys are getting old.  Stern's getting old.  These guys, I mean, they're still young, but...  They're not lady trucker age, are they?  You're around good company.  Let me ask you a question. 
[03:37:30]  Please do.  If there's one person you look up to in the radio business, who is it?  Well, it's hard to say one person.  It would be probably Opie Anthony and Jim.  You know what I mean?  And Jim.  These are the three that I've been around since I was just a lowly intern.  How long have you been here?  Over eight years.  So you came in as an intern.  Yeah.  Were you studying broadcasting?  No.  No.  I learned from the School of Hard Knocks.  I learned on the streets.  I learned by coming to this show.  You know, I was... 
[03:38:00]  And how did you get hired as an intern?  Why did they choose you?  I don't know if you've looked around.  I don't know if you saw the transition between Opie and Anthony and this show.  If you looked at the interns that were cleaning up.  It's not the most difficult thing in the world to get an internship with the Opie and Anthony show.  Maybe a lot of people think that, but it's not.  Have you had any women being interns here?  Yes.  Nikki's not here today.  Is she rocking?  No, she's not.  We have a cute girl who's interning for us now.  We had a couple of cute girls interning for us over the summer.  Yeah, now... 
[03:38:30]  So you were one of the guys who survived.  That's exactly right.  The thing about the intern, it's not that difficult to get an internship with the show.  What makes it difficult is sticking around, finding a job, finding a place for yourself, and advancing, Ian.  You know.  Yeah.  I mean, it's not a matter of winning a championship.  It's a matter of holding it.  Do you know what I mean?  Absolutely.  It's easy to get there.  It's tough to stay.  You know, it's a very good point.  Right.  It's really tough to stay there.  I mean, Howard, he's one guy who's managed to stay there forever. 
[03:39:00]  He had so many people trying to bring him down over the years.  Right.  And these guys...  And O.B. and Anthony the same way.  Exact same thing with O&A.  I mean, you have, down the hall, side by side...  Right.  ...two of the biggest radio icons, as shows go, that we've ever seen in North America.  I don't think I could be in better company.  You can't.  Right.  You're like playing for the Yankees now.  Right.  And then, by the way, that makes it a little difficult, because when you've got somebody  who's just starting baseball, and he gets thrown on the Yankees roster, people are going 
[03:39:30]  to be a little critical.  That's right.  You know what I mean?  You don't get to learn.  But you also advance a whole lot quicker than you would otherwise.  What's been your biggest highlight here?  Probably the time I went to the bed-in, and got to get in bed.  All kidding aside.  I mean, there are highlights happening all the time.  But your biggest one, all kidding aside.  Just last week, and it's hard to say, because it happened just last week, we had Jenna Jameson  on the show.  How was that?  It was great.  It was Jim and I, though.  She was on the after show.  And Norton stuck around.  With Jim?  Yeah.  Norton, me...  I love Jim Norton, by the way. 
[03:40:00]  He's great.  He's great.  He's a consummate pro.  But let me tell you about this Jenna Jameson.  She came in to promote her book.  Yeah.  And Jim Norton stuck around with me.  We interviewed her.  Complete wreck.  Like, Jenna is off the rails.  She appeared to be on something.  I don't know for a fact that she was, but she certainly gave off that impression.  She wasn't following questions.  She was incoherent.  But we kept her for the whole 35 minutes.  We put the interview out there.  It's on YouTube.  It was last week. 
[03:40:30]  It's well over 100,000 hits.  What about Ron and Fez?  What were their names there?  Ron and Fez.  Are they still around?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They come on after this show.  They're here after the show.  After.  After this show.  Because these guys were huge, too.  Ron and Fez, of course.  Yeah.  And how's their show doing now?  Great.  I mean, Fez doesn't talk much, but...  So they're on the ONA network now?  Yes.  Ron and Fez are on the Opie and Anthony channel.  Okay.  And, yeah, their show's been gangbusters.  I'm sure.  Gangbusters.  Yeah, they're big.  So, as a channel right now, what's the lineup? 
[03:41:00]  You have ONA yourself.  You're looking at...  And I wish...  You really should be listening to the channel more often, don't you think?  I know.  I got to...  I feel like you should be listening to what we're doing.  You're right.  Because this is your bread and butter right here.  You're right.  So it's Opie and Anthony in the mornings.  Okay.  After Opie and Anthony live with Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  Andy and Halpern on Sundays.  That I knew.  Then Ron and Fez.  Yeah.  That I knew.  And then we replay.  And then replay.  So there's no other hitters.  No.  This is it.  So it's the three of you.  That's right.  You need the cleanup hitter. 
[03:41:30]  What do you mean?  You need a kind of bad cleanup.  Opie batting one.  You two.  Ron and Fez number three.  They're legends in their own rights.  Oh, yeah.  They've been around forever, those guys.  Oh, yeah.  Very, very successful.  If there's one guy you could interview.  One guy.  Who would it be?  Ian Halpern.  Seriously.  One guy I could interview.  In today's world.  There's a lot of people.  I'd love...  Right now, today...  All right.  Dead or alive?  Today, I would love to get Kanye West in here for an hour. 
[03:42:00]  Yeah, that would be good.  That would be a great interview.  And dead.  Dead?  Yeah, one deceased person who...  Johnny Carson, I would love to talk to.  That would be the guy.  I mean, and he's...  Because you're looking at Johnny Carson as a guy who's not only...  All right.  Does he have a career to speak of, but he knows everybody.  I agree.  Now, if you're allowed to ask the king of late night one question, one question only...  Johnny Carson.  Yes.  What do you ask him?  Only one question. 
[03:42:30]  I guess it would have to be your favorite piece of puss.  Isn't that the question you ask?  I would ask him something else.  What would you ask him?  One moment on his show that defined his career, that took him to the next level.  But don't you think other people have asked him that question before?  Not sure.  I don't know what the answer is, so maybe they haven't.  I'm not sure.  But that's what you'd be curious.  I'd probably ask him if he wears a cock ring.  Those are the questions you need to get to the bottom of, because you don't know what 
[03:43:00]  he's asked him before.  Well, Johnny had a lot of pussy.  He did.  I mean, I saw pictures once, I believe, of Sally Fields.  He was involved.  Do you remember that?  With the graphic photos?  They were taking the sun together.  He was wearing a towel.  Who knows what?  Probably a cock ring underneath.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Do you Google that?  You're good at Googling Sally Field and Johnny Carson.  Well, I can't Google it for me.  I'll host them now.  Because you're working now.  Maybe we'll Google after the show.  Who's on the hotline, Eric?  Oh, uh, Jose.  I worship you.  Jose.  Hello.  Yes.  I just want to say to your highness, I love him and I worship him. 
[03:43:30]  Hey, Jose.  Jose.  I love the name, because there's been some great baseball players, some great dignitaries,  some great entertainers.  Right.  Jose Feliciano.  Feliz Navidad.  Jose Canseco.  Jose, can you see?  Jose, where are you calling from today?  I am calling from Montreal, Canada.  I need my dog, his highness.  After you. 
[03:44:00]  Now, where do you live in Montreal, Jose?  Good question.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  What street are you on in Montreal, Jose?  Great question.  La, la, la, la, la.  Now, Ian, did you meet Roland today?  I believe I did.  Our talent booker?  Yeah.  Jose sounds very much like Roland.  Very much like him.  Jose.  What a name.  Yeah, they do sound alike.  I slipped, I slipped, Roland, maybe 20 bucks to make this call.  You did?  Well, it worked.  And we got a chick on the phone.  Bring him on.  Denise in New York.  Hey, Primetime Sam Roberts.  How are you? 
[03:44:30]  You love the show.  Thanks.  As a matter of fact, I love the show so much, I always listen to it, and I'm a little disappointed  today.  You usually get such good guests, and I had to Google this guy to see who he was.  Well, he's Ian Alpern.  He's his highness, Hollywood.  I'm sorry to disappoint you, Denise, really.  So sorry.  So sorry to make your day bad, but you sound like you have a nice voice, so I wish you  all the best.  Well, thanks.  Hey, Sam, is there anything I can win today?  Yeah, I'll give you a copy of The Hangover 3 on Blu-ray.  All right, make sure you sign it, okay? 
[03:45:00]  Hey, Denise, hold on a second.  Leave her here.  She has a nice voice.  What do you do, Denise?  I am the wife of the trucker, and I'm a housewife.  All right.  And does the trucker bang you well?  Excuse me?  Great question.  Does the trucker bang you well?  He does okay.  He does okay.  Yeah?  How many times a night can he go?  Because I heard truckers have extreme endurance.  Libidos, too.  You have to realize that, you know, he's on the road a lot, so when he's home, we've got  to make up for lost time. 
[03:45:30]  And do you think he's monogamous when he's on the road?  Does he, uh...  No, no lot lizards?  Well, believe me, if someone was going to be paying, they'd be paying him.  All right.  Oh, he's that hot?  Sure, he married me.  I wouldn't marry the garbage.  Oh, yeah?  How big is his machacho?  That's a great question, Ian.  You know, I think you seem a little interested in my husband.  That sounds great.  I mean, you sound like a classy woman, and I just want to make sure that you're well-positioned 
[03:46:00]  and that you're happy in your life.  You sound like a straight arrow, Denise.  Denise, I'm going to...  You sound like a combination of Princess Diana meets Roseanne Barr, and I'm trying to decide  who you are.  Denise, I'm going to put you on hold, and the phone screener's going to get your address.  Hey, have a good day, Denise.  I have to talk to Ian about your new life.  You used to come in here, you'd call up, you'd talk about all the chicks that you're banging.  Do you think I'm mellowed?  You'd bring chicks in.  Do you think I'm mellowed, Roberts? 
[03:46:30]  I think you've mellowed.  Let me...  People must confuse you.  There's a rocker up in Canada called Sam Roberts.  Oh, I know.  Canadian people know you.  He's not big in the States.  He's not.  He's never broke in the States.  Is there any confusion between the two of you?  I mean, do people email you and thinking, you know, vice versa?  No.  Every now and then, somebody will pipe up on a YouTube comment.  Is that your real name, by the way?  Sam Roberts.  Yeah, it's a beautiful broadcasting name.  Is it not?  It is.  Thank you.  A lot of people change their name.  No, I'm not.  Not me.  You know, a lot of Jewish people change their name because they didn't want to be called, 
[03:47:00]  like, Chaim Lewinsky.  Right.  Is Ian Halpern your birth name?  It is.  That's beautiful.  And, but Sam Roberts is your birth name.  That's my birth name.  Samuel.  Samuel.  Yeah.  And the middle name?  Wood.  Samuel W. Roberts.  That's a great name, isn't it?  I think that's a very distinguished name.  My question, though, is have, what is it like for you, the king, the former king of pussy  getting, that's what they called you, to now be in a relationship? 
[03:47:30]  Yeah, I don't miss those days at all.  You don't?  You live one life.  What about all that strange?  It's one kick at the can, no dress rehearsal, and every day is a new day, and you've got  to respect every day and reap the most benefits out of every day.  Right.  End of story.  Get that pussy is what you're saying.  No.  No.  No.  I read you all about that.  You get over it.  Look at yourself.  You're married.  I'm married.  You're wearing the ring.  Yeah.  Are you happy?  Couldn't be happier.  What does she do?  She works for a movie studio, an animation movie studio. 
[03:48:00]  3D?  As a matter of fact.  Yeah, they do 3D movies, sure.  Which studio?  It's one of the top studios.  They make real movies.  No, it's not Pixar, but it's on the level of Pixar.  And they're in the city?  Yeah, they're in New York.  So which studio?  Give us the name.  I'm not going to give you the name, because then...  Well, I mean, I guess...  Why not?  Give them a plug.  It's the company that makes Ice Age and those movies.  That's a big brand.  Big brand.  That's a huge brand.  And what does she do?  She's a creative executive there. 
[03:48:30]  And how did you meet her?  We went to the same high school.  That's awesome.  We've known each other for many years.  So you've been together forever?  Yeah, we've been together as long as I've been with the show, actually.  And any kids on the way?  Not yet.  But you want to have children?  At some point, sure.  What about the girl you're with, Ian?  You're all questions, no answers.  No, I'm a journalist.  I have to ask questions.  I understand, but I'm a broadcaster.  I'm keeping the girl very private.  She's really nice.  What's her first name?  You tell me that.  I'm not going to say her first name.  What does it start with?  I'm not going to say her first name.  Is it Brittany?  No, it's not Brittany. 
[03:49:00]  Okay, I thought it was Brittany.  No, Brittany.  So she's a private person.  Yeah.  This must be...  She has a master's.  So does she understand what it's like for you to be a public person?  When you come home and you've got tweets that are saying, some great, many not so great.  When you've got strangers coming up to you on the street, videoing you, allegedly crying outside of a Burger King.  Does she understand the life of a public person like you?  Sure.  She does? 
[03:49:30]  I'm not so public.  And of course, I mean, it's all part of the person.  And how many times do you bang her per night?  Per night?  Per night.  On a given night.  On a good night.  I'd say 11 times a week.  What?  11 times a week?  How old are you, Ian?  I'm not going to tell you.  More or less.  Give me a ball.  How old do I look to you?  I'd say 42.  All right.  We'll keep it at that.  Okay.  I'm not going to get into...  So we'll jump around.  We'll jump up a little bit.  We'll jump up a bit.  45 then.  At 45 years old. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah.  You're banging 11 times a week?  Yeah.  Do I look in shape?  You look in great shape.  Yeah.  And you know, you come in and you tell me I look like a disaster.  No, I said...  I said you look like you're overworked.  I'm good.  I'm good for maybe three times a week.  So you...  Not 11.  I'm worried about you.  You are.  I don't want you to die young.  Right.  The mortality rate is still 100%.  Yes or no?  Yes.  In 60 years, will this show still be on the air here?  I wouldn't think so, no.  All right.  How could it?  So we agree on something, Roberts.  Right. 
[03:50:30]  Now...  That's two things.  I came in here, and I love you.  Thank you very much.  But I was worried about you...  I see.  ...because you look white.  Mm-hmm.  Well, I'm a white person.  You look like you haven't left the studio since I've been on the show.  But look at what I've done.  You've done great.  Right.  But how far did that get a lot of guys in this business who just burnt out and faded away?  I won't let that happen, Ian.  You know why?  They all say that.  But you know why I won't let it happen?  Because I have in my mind, I can't disappoint His Highness Hollywood Ian Halpern. 
[03:51:00]  Thank you.  A lot of people don't have that.  What's the game plan?  What's your five-year plan?  The five-year...  Well, right now, I feel like I'm in a great place with this show.  Yeah.  And this brand.  I feel like I'm doing a great job of taking my brand and building it off of this brand.  So if we can keep moving at the pace we're moving at now, we should be right on par for  The Sam Roberts Show to become a regular entity outside of the Opie and Anthony world. 
[03:51:30]  Not to say I won't also exist inside the Opie and Anthony world.  I think that's a good plan.  That's the plan.  And I think it's feasible.  Thank you.  Because you paid your dues.  Right.  You're a smart guy.  Mm-hmm.  Immensely talented.  You ask good questions.  Thank you.  And I think you've just got to stay with the program.  Let me ask you.  But you've got to be healthy.  Right.  Are you eating well?  No.  That's not right.  Do you eat a lot of junk food?  I don't eat a lot in general.  I'm a skinny guy.  Yeah, you are.  But I can't give up on soda pop.  Can't give up on fast food. 
[03:52:00]  Can't do it.  What fast food do you eat?  I'll have, I'll help myself to a bit of KFC.  I will.  Yeah.  I will.  I'll stop at a Popeye's if I see it.  I will.  I'll do that.  Do you ever read the ingredients?  No.  What goes into this stuff?  Do you agree, yes or no, that we're a product of what goes into ourselves?  Yeah, of course.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think, I think what you need is a, um, you need to consult with a nutrition expert.  I feel like that's, because that's going to change your life. 
[03:52:30]  I need to start treating myself like a superstar if I want to be treated like a superstar.  Absolutely.  You're abusing yourself now.  And what I suggest to you, Roberts, instead of going out seven times a week and having a  bunch of junk food, go out one time a week and do it properly.  Cheat day.  You can have a cheat day.  Cheat day.  Why not?  Let me ask you.  I'm worried about you.  Don't worry about me.  No, no.  I'm great.  I'm worried.  I'm worried about you because you look white.  You tell, I'm white.  A lot of people thought I was black all these years. 
[03:53:00]  You tell me.  How long have you been seeing this girl of yours?  I'm not going to talk about relationships.  More or less.  More than a year, less than a year.  I'm not going to say.  I'm not going to say.  Maybe less than a year.  All due respect to her, she's an amazing woman.  Do you use protection when you have sex, when you fornicate?  Of course.  Of course.  You do.  It's smart.  Of course.  Come on.  I'm a germaphobe.  Yeah, but you probably, I mean, it's one thing.  So you've always used condoms when you were hooking up with these girls before your relationship.  In a relationship, you will still use condoms. 
[03:53:30]  Absolutely.  How long do you have to be in a relationship before you stop using condoms?  I only do it when we decide if we want to pull the trigger and have kids.  Is the age difference enough that that is a possibility?  Yeah.  It is.  Of course.  Is this the girl that you might marry?  Could you make her Brittany Halpern?  I don't believe in marriage.  Institution of marriage in North America, with all due respect to anybody in marriage, the  numbers are almost at 60% today that dissolve.  And I think you have to look at alternative ways of coexisting and of expressing love in 
[03:54:00]  today's world.  So to be right on with you, I think we have to reinvent the Cupid formula.  So you're like, this is my bitch who I'm with.  No.  But that's not to say something like that.  There's a lot of people who are together who don't get married for various reasons, and  you have to respect those reasons.  You can't, Roberts, go against the numbers.  Right. 
[03:54:30]  Percentages dictate.  But I did.  You cannot go against the majority.  But I did.  You did?  I got married.  But you're only, what, a year and a half into the equation?  A year and a half.  But we've been in a relationship for eight years.  What was the wedding day?  Do you still remember the day?  June 11th, I'd like to say.  Okay.  June's a good time to get married.  It is.  Did you have a nice day?  Was it beautiful outside?  Great wedding.  Were you crying?  Beautiful day.  I'm not going to say I was crying.  There was a little mist.  Was there a chuppah?  There was a little mist.  We did.  She's half Jewish.  You'll like that.  You'll be very pleased about that. 
[03:55:00]  Father or mother?  Mother.  That means she's Jewish.  So you'll be happy about that.  Not half.  She's Jewish.  So that means if we have children, Jews, that could be good for them because show business  loves a Jew.  Do you like Jews?  I mean, I married one, right?  Yeah.  So what does that say?  I'm just asking.  You're Jewish?  A lot of people don't.  Do I look Jewish?  Do you look Jewish?  I don't think so.  I don't know what that is.  I'm very Jewish.  Yeah.  But I like you.  Yeah.  Likewise.  You know?  I think it's fantastic that you married a Jew because interracial is what works best 
[03:55:30]  today.  And I think you're giving your kids options of learning about both cultures.  And more variety.  It's a fast world today.  And the more options you have, the better.  Is the woman that you're with different?  Is she Jewish?  No.  Oh, so you like that.  Yeah.  I like interracial.  I'm like yourself.  Is she a different ethnicity than you?  You're talking about color?  Color.  No.  She's white.  She's whiter than you, Robert.  She is.  Yeah. 
[03:56:00]  Do you worry about her?  I'm very worried about her.  She's got to get some color.  I'm making her take beet juice every day.  Is that what helps?  Carrot juice.  Ginger.  When was the last time you had ginger, Robert?  You used to come on here and talk about your affinity for black women.  Yeah.  Is this a point of contention?  Because I'll tell you this, Ian.  But we're talking about the past.  But I'll tell you about it.  I live in the present.  I'll give you a...  Have you ever banged a black chick?  Oh, yeah.  And I'll give you a story about me.  How was it?  It was great.  How did the puss smell?  It smelled fine.  It smelled great.  I mean, to me, there is not...  Did you lick the puss? 
[03:56:30]  I did.  Nice.  You're a good man.  To me, there's not a difference.  Yeah.  You know, a lot of people say that there is...  There's no difference.  There is no difference.  However, when I first started dating the girl who went on to be my wife, she was a little  insecure about when she'd see me, you know, giving the up and down to a black chick, she'd  say, well, what's that about?  Because that's the one thing that she's not black.  She'll never be black.  What can she do?  Is the girl that you're with looking at your history, looking at your affinity for ethnic  women, and saying, that makes me a little insecure? 
[03:57:00]  No, not at all.  She's not.  Not at all.  You know, you have to live in the presence.  You have to embrace every day with respect, with dignity.  Right.  And in the past, there's only so much we can do about the past.  It's gone.  We can't bring it back.  All you can do is embrace it, quite frankly.  You know, I respect baseball teams who play like 390-400 one year, and the next year they  come back, and they're on fire.  Look at the Colorado Avalanche this year in hockey. 
[03:57:30]  Right.  Are you a hockey fan, Roberts?  No.  No, I don't know what you're talking about.  One time I checked, they had a terrible season last year.  They're 10-1 this year.  Right.  Do we have any sport fans who are going to call in here today?  I mean, you look at the New York Giants.  And talk with His Highness.  Yeah, the Giants.  That's the reverse, isn't it?  One and six.  Right.  Did they win this week, or they won?  They won this weekend.  So they're two, or one?  No, no, no.  That's one.  That's one.  That they got one.  They got a Super Bowl quarterback there.  And would it surprise you if next year they come back, and they have a 10-6 season, and they 
[03:58:00]  win the Super Bowl?  You love the comeback story.  I love it.  That's your shit.  I love the comeback.  When you could say, I could sit here.  You said something very profound today, Robert.  You said, it's easy to get there, but it's tough to sustain.  Right.  And that's the key.  Sustaining.  It's so difficult, because then you have everybody and their uncle breathing down your  back.  Right.  Like, guess what?  Are you going to let me stay with you as a house guest episode?  You want to?  Yeah, you can stay in my place.  I'm going to pitch that to my producer. 
[03:58:30]  I think that'd be a lot of fun.  I think it would be.  Are you going on adventures together?  I live in Westchester, New York.  That's a nice place.  That's great.  Do you own?  No, I rent.  What are you paying a month there?  Less than $2,000.  That's a great deal.  It's a great deal.  How many bedrooms?  One and a half.  That's fantastic.  For two people?  How many do you need?  I just looked.  I opened my eyes, you know?  That's an amazing deal.  I became aware.  What's the train ride from Westchester to here?  Train ride's only 35 minutes, but I drive.  Do people recognize you on the train now?  I drive. 
[03:59:00]  You drive?  Because I have to get here so early in the morning.  You drive alone, or you drive with your better half?  No, I drive alone.  But I'm going to tell you...  You both have cars?  Oh, yeah.  And I'm going to tell you this, Ian.  I get recognized all the time.  Out on the street in New York.  I'm sure.  Everywhere I go.  How does it feel?  Great.  You like it?  Never better.  Does it inflate your ego?  Oh, yeah.  Do you wear glasses, Roberts?  Sunglasses?  I'll wear sunglasses, but only to protect my eyes from the UV.  Not for, you know, aesthetics.  I'm going to talk to you about people of different ethnicities. 
[03:59:30]  You know who Russell Peters is?  Yes.  Great.  Great comedian, isn't he?  Amazing.  Amazing.  Well, Orange is the New Black, House of Cards, Arrested Development.  Are you ready for the next big thing from Netflix?  Yeah.  I hope so.  Prepare yourself for Notorious, Netflix's newest comedy special,  starring international stand-up sensation Russell Peters.  Russell started doing stand-up as a kid in his native Toronto,  and now he's one of the biggest comedians in the entire world.  Ian, you're from, you're a Canadian.  You understand how massive this guy is.  He's a giant.  He really is.  Extremely talented. 
[04:00:00]  Over 75 million views on YouTube,  nearly a million Facebook fans,  and one of the most diverse audiences on the planet.  He's sold out arenas like Madison Square Garden  and Sydney's Royal Opera House.  Ian, that's in Australia.  Also launching with Russell's new special,  Notorious, is Russell Peters vs. the World,  an exclusive four-part series  that takes you behind the scenes on Russell's tour  and has tons of great outtakes and interviews with his family and friends.  Don't miss Notorious and Russell Peters vs. the World, 
[04:00:30]  now streaming only on Netflix.  Ian, I gotta ask you,  you're now talking about this reality show  that you're doing now where you live in people's homes.  And like I said, I want you in my home.  I think this could be a great episode.  I'm gonna pitch it.  Is this the end of Ian Halperin,  celebrity journalist,  tearing the woe off from people's eyes  and exposing the seedy underbelly  of people like Michael Jackson and Courtney Love 
[04:01:00]  and the governator himself?  Well, I...  Are we done exposing celebrities?  Yeah, I think...  I think that's a thing of the past.  I did for so many years.  And, you know,  you always gotta keep progressing.  Yeah.  I've been doing movies for about eight years now.  Mm-hmm.  You know, I never say never, but...  Do celebrities get mad at you  when you come out with these books?  No.  My books are fair.  They're balanced.  Yeah, but I mean...  They're not hatchet jobs. 
[04:01:30]  A celebrity doesn't want a balanced book.  A celebrity wants a book  that's completely in their favor.  Yeah, they want a puff piece.  Right.  I don't do puff pieces,  and you know that very well, Robert.  That's why I have you on.  I wouldn't have on some...  No puff pieces,  but I'm more, you know,  I'm a serious filmmaker.  I've been doing movies.  I love the art of filmmaking.  And it's just so exciting today  with Netflix out there.  Oh, we were just talking about that.  YouTube.  People have access to information. 
[04:02:00]  And the key is to give the people choices.  And they have so many choices right now.  How many people are listening to this show today?  Hundreds of thousands.  Hundreds of thousands?  I would say so.  Does that mean half a million, 750?  What's your guess?  I'll say three quarters of a million people at least.  All right.  So get me one more woman on the line.  All right.  One more woman out of 750.  Let's see.  Conrad in Canada.  Are you a woman?  Hmm.  He can't even answer the phone.  What about Carl in Boston?  Is that a woman's name? 
[04:02:30]  No, it's Keith.  Same thing.  Yeah.  No, no guys.  No guys.  Okay.  All right.  Let me talk to then...  I guess Dave.  That sounds feminine.  And Dave in Long Island.  Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  Hey.  You cannot let this princess stay at your house.  Why?  Because reality shows a scam.  To do what?  What's...  He's freeloading, staying in people's houses.  He'll be the first guy watching it. 
[04:03:00]  You know one thing I'll tell you?  All these detractors...  Yeah.  Without them, I probably would have sold two books in my career.  They all...  They'll talk shit, but then they'll go out and buy the books.  They're the first guys to buy it.  They're the first guys to watch the show.  It's amazing.  And do they act as motivation for you?  Um...  Nah.  You know, I wish them all the best.  They don't even affect you.  They don't affect me at all.  Like Jay-Z said, you brush that dirt off your shoulder.  That's it.  That's it.  You know...  Do you think I'm a talented guy, Robert?  I think so, Ian.  And I think specifically in your way with words, and the passion and the art with which you 
[04:03:30]  can sell your projects.  I mean, people say what they want to say about you, but this book, oh, this book's never going  to get made.  Well, all of a sudden, the governator's on a bookshelf.  All of a sudden, this Lady Gaga movie's on the TV Guide channel.  Why do you think they hate me so much?  Do you think they're anti-Jewish?  What's the deal?  Do you think they're jealous?  I think there's some anti-Semitism.  Yeah.  I think people don't like a self-motivated person.  I think the level to which you are self-assured might strike people as somewhat less than 
[04:04:00]  endearing.  Yeah.  And I think that has a lot to do with it.  I think when a person is their own biggest fan, people feel like they don't need to get  behind them anymore.  That's a good point.  Right?  That's a very good point.  Right.  You know, I've got to say this.  How much time?  Only a minute or two.  Only a minute.  We're running out of racetrack.  Right.  There's not a lot of time here.  We almost hit that finish line.  Yeah.  Let me get one woman on the line before we leave. 
[04:04:30]  There has to be one woman on the line because I'm going to ask a question, too.  Oh, this is going to be good.  And if she gets the answer, do you have something to give her?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Let's get one woman on the line and I'm going to throw out a question.  While we're waiting for that, you know about getting your woman gifts.  Now that you're a monogamous man, you have to get her gifts all the time.  When you need to get the woman in your life a gift.  Yes.  As you tend to do, you want it to be a great gift.

[04:06:00]  Connie.  Yes.  Ramon, give this man AIDS in his tuchus.  You don't want AIDS in your tuchus, do you?  That's ridiculous.  It sounds like really nice, really nice people, these guys.  Truly ridiculous.  It's just so sad that there's people with such vitriolic attitudes out there.  You're scaring them with those big words.  You're scaring them with those big words right now.
