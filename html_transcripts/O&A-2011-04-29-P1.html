<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a delayed airing of Prince William and Kate Middleton's Royal Wedding. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton provided a running commentary filled with sexually explicit jokes, mockery of the wedding attendees' appearances (particularly Prince Charles' comb-over and Kate Middleton's dress), and crude speculation about their sex lives.  Their commentary included descriptions of the ceremony, music, and procession, punctuated by numerous crass jokes about bodily functions and sexual organs.  Significant attention was devoted to Pippa Middleton's attractiveness.  The hosts also found the official gift of a boys' choir particularly absurd.  The delay itself became a recurring comedic element, fueling further offensive asides.

The broadcast then transitioned to a discussion about the upcoming change in their SiriusXM channel numbers.  The hosts expressed extreme frustration and confusion over the lack of communication from their superiors, repeatedly demanding that a representative explain the seemingly illogical change and the resulting disruption to listeners.  Listeners called in reporting difficulties receiving the show in their cars due to problems with their car radios and XM service.  The hosts discussed these technical difficulties with a representative off-air, but their frustration remained high.

The conversation then meandered through several tangential topics, including a caller’s 911 experience and flat tire; opinions on the XM app; the placement of the “boneyard” channel; a listener's car radio damaged by a fluid leak; the status of the show's internship program; and E-Rock's remarkably punctual 5:52 AM arrival time.

Amy Schumer joined the show as a guest.  The discussion immediately shifted to her attractiveness, the Royal Wedding (continuing the offensive commentary), and a humorous retelling of a photo shoot.  Numerous "F.U." calls from listeners aired, venting frustrations about exes, neighbors, and family members. A detailed discussion about a soft-core pornographic video Amy Schumer made with other female comedians ensued, along with numerous sexually explicit and offensive jokes and comments about Amy Schumer's appearance, racial stereotypes, and sexual acts.  The hosts also briefly discussed a *South Park* episode and a listener’s complaint about a spoiled plotline. The segment concluded with speculation about unused photos from a magazine photoshoot and further commentary on Amy Schumer's appearance and comedic persona.


Following Amy Schumer's appearance, Kevin Pollak joined the show as a guest.  The conversation started with sexually explicit and offensive discussions about the hosts’ dating experiences, focusing on women with "daddy issues" or "abuse issues."  This led to graphic descriptions of pornography preferences, including interracial sex and double penetration.  The hosts and Schumer continued making crude and offensive jokes about various racial and ethnic groups. The Royal Wedding, playing on a television in the background, continued to be the subject of extensive mockery. Amy Schumer shared drunken anecdotes from her travels, including an incident at Oktoberfest.

The conversation then shifted to Pollak's acting career and his impressions of celebrities like Christopher Walken, William Shatner, Jack Nicholson, and Robert De Niro, with details about his interactions with them. The hosts and Pollak discussed impression techniques, employing offensive language throughout.  The segment concluded with promotional information for Schumer's new CD and Pollak's upcoming performances.

A later segment featured Kevin Pollak promoting his new movie, *Casino*.  He shared anecdotes from the film's set, including Don Rickles' offensive heckling of Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci's reaction to Rickles’ jokes, and Alan King's participation.  The conversation also touched on Pollak's podcast, its production, and upcoming projects like *Red State* and *The Big Year*.  He recounted impersonating Lenny Bruce at Carnegie Hall. The segment ended with promotional information for Pollak's upcoming stand-up performances, *Casino*, and Amy Schumer's comedy album, *Cutting*, along with a humorous exchange involving a joke about a bulk CD purchase and a promise of a fisting. Amy Schumer remained in studio throughout this segment.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  I am amazed it lasted this long.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Holy mother of God.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  There's no positives out of this thing, except for everybody's blood.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  Oh, my God. 
[00:00:30]  Okay, no, this is getting really intense now.  It starts funny and then it gets very uncomfortable.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  You couldn't have picked a fucking more self-destructive show.  You get the crazier, the better.  Yeah, yeah.  What, are you, 19?  I'm 19.  Delicious.  You made Springer uncomfortable.  Do you know how hard that is to do?  Thank God this show is on radio.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Hey, let's go, fuck.  I have a good time.  What the fuck?  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime. 
[00:01:00]  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, good morning.  Good morning, everybody.  Thank God we made it just in time for the royal wedding.  Yes, we are your royal wedding headquarters.  Your one-stop royal wedding show.  Yes.  I'll turn down our music and put on their music.  Same thing.  It pretty much is. 
[00:01:30]  Very pomp and circumstance.  Opie, what we're seeing here, just amazing.  The wonderful hats, like I said, the pomp, the circumstance.  This is royal tradition dating back hundreds of years.  There, of course, Prince Charles in his military garb.  All those medals that he earned somewhere.  With his huge comb-over.  Yes.  He's wearing his comb-over hat.  His royal comb-over.  The royal comb-over. 
[00:02:00]  And here it is.  We are gathered here in the sight of God.  I know.  In the face of this congregation, to join together this man and this woman.  How embarrassing would it be if she sneezed and queefed in front of the whole world?  It is an honorable estate.  The beautiful dress.  It's the teacher of God himself.  Hair down, Opie.  Hair down, which I was told her hair would have been up, but down.  A surprise.  It really is a surprise, Anthony.  And Prince William's hair falling out.  Falling out as we speak. 
[00:02:30]  As we speak.  I thought it was some type of...  I thought they were throwing rice already, but it's actually his follicles just popping  out of his head.  The last bit of hair he has on the top of his head falling out as he walks down the aisle.  Amazing.  He looks like he's carrying a jaguar on his shoulders.  He is a vows.  He's not a good-looking man.  Holy cow.  That Kate Middleton is married for power.  I'll tell you, that crown notches you up a few bits, though, right?  It certainly does.  It turns a four into a nine.  Oh, believe me.  I'm not going to fucking dip into that argument.  The radio show does the same thing. 
[00:03:00]  Dude, you get hot chicks with a jacuzzi.  Imagine what a crown gets you.  Exactly.  And for the increase of my life, according to...  Oh, it's fantastic.  What a day, though, for us and everybody, of course, across the pond, I want to say congratulations  to them, the entire kingdom.  It is ordained in order that the natural instant, the affectionate, the bishop, the priest, the  whatever the fuck they call him.  Oh, excuse my language.  Giving the, what do you call that, Sam? 
[00:03:30]  You know what this is?  No, no.  Yeah, yeah.  The vows or something.  In pureness of love.  Uh, Prince William looking so dapper in his military dress uniform.  More medals that God knows how he earned.  He was a pilot.  A lot of people in Wales.  Oh, in Wales.  Yes.  That's good.  What's up with all the hats?  These two persons...  What about the hats?  What's up with the hats?  They gave him hats.  They make the women look retarded.  It is sort of a Kentucky Derby kind of a thing. 
[00:04:00]  But they're we...  The Derby.  They're ridiculous looking, but they keep talking about how beautiful the hats are.  Yeah.  How mad would people be when they said, if you have any objections, let them speak.  If I was in the back and I yelled out, Jim Norton, tickets for Seattle on sale today.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, no.  Oh, Jimmy.  He got us.  Yes, he got us.  Now the big bishop comes up with his big dick hat.  With his big wobbly hat.  It looks like a big cock hat. 
[00:04:30]  That he's wearing.  The golden dickhead hat.  You can almost see her nips.  She's sexy, man.  Well, that's the dress.  It was supposed to kind of give you the illusion that you could see the body.  They're telling us.  Yeah.  I don't like the bottom part of it.  The top part's kind of...  No, she likes the v-neck, even though she has tiny little booties.  B-cup tits, yeah.  Nice.  You've got to see her sister.  Holy shit.  Kate Middleton, sister.  Oh, here it is.  Will thou have this woman to thy wedded wife...  To thou!  To live together according to God's law in the holiest state of men.  Holy, holy. 
[00:05:00]  Will thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her...  Yes.  ...in sickness and in health.  Yes.  And forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live.  I will.  Yes.  Do you have a sucker guy's cock? 
[00:05:30]  Who is the guy doing the actual ceremony?  Is he like the big Bishop of London?  William Arthur Philip Lewis.  They all look like chess pieces.  I'm William Arthur Philip Lewis.  I think he can only move diagonally.  That's my wedded wife.  That's very awkward for a bishop. 
[00:06:00]  Who from this day forward?  It takes a while to get there.  Yes.  It takes a while to get there.  For richer, for poorer.  For richer, for poorer.  Oh, believe me.  It'll be richer.  Don't worry about it.  Don't worry about the poor part.  We should just cut that part out.  Really?  We'll see if she sticks around, if he loses his money like Arthur.  Yeah.  I'll work.  I'll get a job.  And that's you.  I'll give thee my trust.  Mr. Middleton's taken the knife out of the cheese.  You think you want some cheese? 
[00:06:30]  I'm Captain Elizabeth.  Take thee, William Arthur Philip Lewis.  What if I make a cranky?  To my wedded husband.  To my wedded husband.  To have and to hold from this day forward.  To have and to hold from this day forward.  You know what that means.  For better for worse.  For better for worse.  For better for worse.  In sickness and illness.  To have and to hold from this day forward.  To have and to hold from this day forward.  According to God's holy life.  Oh, ta-da-ta-da! 
[00:07:00]  And there too, I give thee my trust.  And there too, I give thee my trust.  That's terrific!  That's terrific!  Uh-oh.  Me and Mech are gonna wing on over London and jam with the stones.  They remain faithful to each other and abide in my peace and favor and live together in  running to their lives.  You'll notice they didn't say obey.  Go somewhere else if you want a real fucking cock. 
[00:07:30]  He has a nice hat.  They all have nice hats.  The only guy that should be wearing a hat is it.  Uh-oh, he can't get the ring on!  He can't get the fucking ring on!  She's all bloated.  She's on a period.  The fucking dress is like the flag of Japan.  The red panties are coming!  The red panties are coming!  Oh my body gets with the usher.  Wow, he couldn't get the ring on.  I guess they'll be discussing that for hours tonight. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, it will be.  Crazy.  Can you imagine if he had whispered, you're getting fucking fat, bitch?  Who's this guy coming out now?  Oh, that's another guy.  Another church.  Uh, church.  Another fucking chess piece, yes.  I like that.  If you have a structured settlement and you need cash now...  It does look like a J.G. Wentworth commercial.  He's wearing a rug.  He is wearing a rug.  Send thy blessing upon these thy servants,  this man and this woman whom we bless in thy name. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah.  That living faithfully together,  they may surely perform and keep the vow and covenant betwixt them made.  What the hell is church?  Betwixt?  This ring given and received is a token and pledge.  And may ever remain in perfect love and peace together,  and live according to thy laws.  Jesus Christ of...  This guy didn't fucking do anything to his hair.  No, he's a mess.  This guy's a disaster.  He has hat head.  Oh, because he had that hat on.  Yeah.  This guy's got a hat so pointy. 
[00:09:00]  His ass.  Those whom God put his hands together,  let no man put a son.  I get emotional with this stuff.  Yeah, Chip, I hear you.  It makes me really sad.  They bound their hands together.  As William and Catherine have consented together in holy wedlock.  May I?  And have witnessed the same before God and this company.  Okay.  That you have given the same.  They both abide into honor.  And have witnessed the same by giving and receiving of a ring and by joining of a ring. 
[00:09:30]  Is this real life?  In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.  Amen.  God the Father.  God the Son.  God the Holy Ghost.  Bless, preserve, and keep you.  The Lord mercifully with his favor look upon you.  And so fill you with all spiritual benediction and grace.  That ye may so live together in this life.  That in the world to come, ye may have life everlasting. 
[00:10:00]  Amen.  Goodness gracious.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen.  I'll lick my sweaty balls.  You need to shut the fuck up.  Stop talking and start sucking.  And that's it.  Prince William and Kate Middleton are formally married.  They're married.  Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  And that has been an extraordinary day. 
[00:10:30]  A celebration for Britain and for the rest of the world.  It was a tribute to Charles and Camilla.  It was played at Charles and Camilla's wedding in 2005.  St. George's Chapel.  And now they sing.  It's another great tub thumping.  Well, now it's the...  Enjoy this.  Now they leave.  It's a big thing.  They go to the reception and do the chicken dance.  Goddamn rich... 
[00:11:00]  Holy shit.  That's a hard one to score tickets to.  Yeah, that is.  I bet you every seat is a...  Like, every row and every seat is a sign.  Oh, fuck yeah.  But who the hell is half these people?  Family.  England.  A Negro. 
[00:11:30]  On the end.  Wow.  Obama was left off the guest list.  Yeah.  They don't like him.  I don't think it's...  That's probably the security you need for.  Really?  The Secret Service would wreck everything.  Another weird hat.  They all look like the fucking hats that...  from Kate Winslet wore in the first scene of the Titanic that she's in.  Where she lifts her head up and gets the giant fucking hat.  They are all wearing that.  Why the pink beanie on that guy? 
[00:12:00]  I don't know.  Charles and Philip.  Prince Charles, man.  You know how mad Charles is that that fucking old bag is still going?  Oh, my God.  What the fuck is she wearing on her head?  Look at the Lady Gaga lady.  That's a Lady Gaga hat.  Right behind the Queen.  The Queen is fucking dressed like the guy that owns Curious George.  She has a yellow hat and suit on.  Oh, she looks awful.  She's terrible.  What's that?  Motherfucker. 
[00:12:30]  The big, long red carpet for the procession.  Just stunning, stunning at Westminster Abbey.  Are those trees usually there?  Where are they bringing the trees?  Look at Sir Elton John with his wig.  Did you at least get a wig that looks like it was combed?  What a fruit.  What a fruit.  He wants to look like there was another man holding his head and fucking his face.  Oh, that could have happened.  She's sexy. 
[00:13:00]  She looks like this chick from Boy Walk Empire.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that hat, though.  This chick's almost falling out of this fucking nut.  It's like the JFK in the limo hat.  Who's the one with the little fuck, with the little ivy on her head?  That's Kate Middleton's sister, by the way.  Oh, she's juicy, man.  Yeah, yeah.  She's got some tits on her.  I'm eating one of the glasses on the end.  I'm matronly fucking nun.  They're barely smiling, man. 
[00:13:30]  What the hell is that about?  She's smiling a little bit.  A little bit.  He's just like, I need a piece of his ass.  It's like, you know what?  How the fuck am I doing?  I'd love to score some Kate Middleton's sister box.  Yeah.  Fucking be in the royal family.  You can make a funny movie about it.  Like a fish out of water movie.  I'm a member of the royal family.  I keep saying the wrong thing.  Hey, who's the queen?  Oh, sorry.  I have the wrong thing.  Brothers.  Oh.  Ancestors.  Me droogies.  By the mercy of God. 
[00:14:00]  To present your bodies as a living sacrifice.  What?  What?  Holy and acceptable.  That's James Middleton reading Romans 12, 1, 2, and 9 through 18.  Thank you.  The only ones that did that right were CNN.  The rest of us have no idea what it is.  Oh, yeah.  No, I did.  It was off the top of my head.  Hey, how come they don't have all this fucking imagery and stuff in the way?  Yeah, what happened?  Where's all that?  Yeah, where's all the fucking crawl and all that shit?  Yeah, I don't know.  What is good?  Yes.  Why the crooked tie?  Is that like the latest fashion? 
[00:14:30]  Wow, that is kind of fucked up.  Perfect.  Is that the new thing?  You're probably nervous.  You're probably holding on a good shit.  Let love be genuine.  You've been shifting from leg to leg.  Hate what is evil.  Hold fast to what is good.  What about the letter from the Corinthians?  I'm going to read that.  With mutual affection.  Corinthians.  Or something.  Outdo one another in showing honor.  They've just got to sit there.  Do not lag in zeal.  Look at those nuns. 
[00:15:00]  Be honored in spirit.  Can they be the most unsexy thing in the world?  Oh, they're the fucking worst.  They just know that they have to be nuns.  Knuckle breakers.  Rejoice in hope.  In hope.  Be patient in suffering.  I want to see her sister again.  Yeah, show that sister.  Give her backside a little tonguing.  Oh, that would be nice, right?  Bend her over.  Contribute to the ease of the saints.  I'd be the crazy, I can't wait to fucking hook up with her.  I'd be the crazy boyfriend.  I see a movie of this.  I can totally see a movie.  Look out, Royals. 
[00:15:30]  And there will be a picture of me on the movie box with my arms out like, I'm here.  Your arms out like, hey, look who's here.  And they're all running away from me and the crown is falling off.  Yeah, yeah.  The crown's falling off.  They're running looking back like, uh-oh, we don't need this guy.  Look out, Royals.  The backdrop is just a big British flag and you're just kind of running.  Oh, I see the movie cover.  Me too.  You know, the big poster.  Yeah.  But associate with the look.  I have a fleshlight in my hand.  And cum is leaking out of it.  Oh, or they want to call it a royal mess. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, that's a good one.  Oh, yeah.  That's perfect.  Jim Norton in a royal mess.  And I'm swinging the fleshlight over my head and there's so much cum built up in it.  It actually looks like I have a fucking, like I have a helicopter above my head.  Is the cum just flying out from centrifugal force?  Yeah.  And they're all trying to duck it and running away?  Yeah.  I'm teasing me.  You're making a royal mess.  Jim Norton's making a royal mess. 
[00:16:30]  Yes.  Cum fleshlight, cummy fleshlight all over the fucking Buckingham Palace.  That's just one of the hijinks that you'd be doing throughout the movie.  Yeah.  Oh, what's this shit?  I don't know.  Let's see what happens next.  Do we got a boys' choir?  I hope so.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  Those kids are such good singers.  The commission by the Dean of Westminster is a wedding gift for the couple.  This is a wedding gift?  Fuck that.  What a shitty gift.  It's a horrible gift.  What a singing kids.  Go fuck yourself.  Look at these little pale English boys. 
[00:17:00]  Hey, it's my birthday too.  57 years ago.  What a shit gift.  Then again, what do you get to somebody who has a kingdom?  Here's a bunch of kids singing.  There you go.  Somebody wants to know how long our delay is because we're way the fuck behind.  We're watching fucking live.  So fuck you.  It's too bad we couldn't sync this up with the people watching at home.  Yeah. 
[00:17:30]  What?  What up?  Well, just sorry listeners, the broadcast has to go to space.  Yeah, yeah.  And then into your car.  Yeah, sorry for the delay.  And this is for people that aren't watching.  That's why we're describing the scene for you.  Now there's gay looking men singing along with the children.  Right.  I've always thought England was half a gay country.  I think they're all, they're like half gay.  Half a fag.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:18:00]  That's what Archie Bunker said, by the way, once.  He did?  Yeah.  He goes, yeah, the whole country's a half fag.  Little cherubic pale, pasty.  They all got English children with rosy red cheeks.  They probably smacked them in the cheeks before this went on to make it look good.  Look good.  Just think, in 15 years you'll be colonizing another nation.  Yes.  Yes.  Wonderful.  Good guy can't even handle this.  Wearing ruffly, ruffly little cum catchers around their neck. 
[00:18:30]  Sure, they all look at Shakespeare.  I have a big one.  I don't remember this song.  What album is this off of?  Yeah.  Nothing worse than an old choir guy.  What the hell is that about?  I understand if you're young, you're forced into it a little bit, but doesn't there come 
[00:19:00]  a time where you just fucking move on?  While that's happening, somebody should be in the back looking through the old choir guy's  laptop.  Sure.  Picture of all the choir boys with their little tepid erections.  In their little robes.  Their curious boyish erections.  They know it shouldn't feel good, and the little sack is tickled, but it does.  While they're singing joy to the world, and he's making the joogie joogie joogie with  his finger on the underside of their little, their taut testicles.  Oh, great. 
[00:19:30]  Who are these fucking balding creeps?  This is just filler, I guess.  Do you know if somebody would marry now, right?  Somebody right now, and I don't know who, but at that wedding is holding in the shit  of their lives.  Somebody is standing there and can't even, or is sitting on one cheek, because they have 
[00:20:00]  a log about to fucking, just, oh, great.  Boom!  Oh, God, what was that?  Your days of finger banging, old Mary Jane ronch ronch, through her pretty pink pennies,  are over!  Yep, you're married now.  Hell, I like you.  You can come over to my house and fuck my sister.  I would like to.  That sister's pretty hot.  She's a little worn looking, but nothing wrong with that.  She's not 100% knockout, but she's a pretty, pretty girl.  She takes good pictures. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I like to give her a pinch.  Just a little...  A good queenie pinch.  This is a gift to them.  I know.  Sucks.  This is a horrible gift.  How long is this?  My gift would be like a fucking, a fucking, a trio of trannies singing tiptoe through the  doors.  You look like girls.  How can this be a gift?  It's a terrible...  It's the shit you hear at every wedding.  Horrible.  You know, my gift would be that they don't sing.  Yeah, exactly.  They were here to sing, but as a gift to King Jim. 
[00:21:00]  I heard one of the, uh, one of the politicians, perhaps some mayor or something, gave them  a bicycle built for two.  Like they'll ever fucking ride that.  Yeah.  When are they going to ride a bicycle built for two?  Well, actually, Elton took it because the seats were gone.  Him and a good friend.  Him and his pal got to the fucking thing.  They have fist seats.  Fist seats.  Hop on a fist seat.  Yeah. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, good golly.  Oh.  He's got a mole on his cheek.  He does.  And now we'll hear an address by the right reverend.  All right.  Oh, great.  16, uh, 32, uh, 5th Avenue.  Thank you.  Who's this guy?  I don't know.  All right.  Give the address.  Be who God meant you to be.  Oh, really?  Oh, great.  And you will set the world on fire.  On fire.  So said...  You shall not pass. 
[00:22:00]  Whose festival day it is today.  Marriage is intended to be a way in which man and woman...  We're not reading...  Which one are we looking at?  ...to become what God meant each one to be.  We're in the middle one, I think.  I think we're not seeing that.  I don't think it's synced up to anything.  Are you serious?  I don't see this guy's lips moving to any of our TVs.  Can we see which one we're synced up to?  This is a joyful day. 
[00:22:30]  Two, right?  It is good that...  I think that's...  Ah, that is weird.  Because this is, as every wedding day should be...  A day of hope.  Well, the last...  A sense every wedding is...  Cool.  Echo in that hall.  King and queen of creation.  Yeah.  Yes.  King and queen of creation.  Let's go way back.  So that life can flow through them.  Yes.  Into the future.  I'd like to get some life flowing through her. 
[00:23:00]  So could you wrap this up?  Exactly.  That's what he's thinking.  People are loving the delay because they're trying to guess what we'll say.  Ah, that's good.  After they see it.  All right.  Yeah.  That's a good game to play.  A good drinking game.  Not bad.  At this hour.  In the person of Jesus Christ.  Prince William looks completely bored.  And in the spirit of this generous God.  I'd be like...  Husband and wife are to give themselves...  Do you think they've had to remarital?  Yeah, of course.  Oh, he's fucking...  He's pink-socked her.  As love finds... 
[00:23:30]  You can barely sit down at this point.  Great.  Fucking Charles Emerson Winchester is doing a reading.  As a Boston general.  We got it.  Yeah.  Into the mystery of spiritual love.  Someone wants to know if Mr. Bean is there today.  Yes.  He made the cut?  He was invited.  How do you know this shit?  I went through the invitation list.  What about like...  One of those RSVPing.  What about Coldplay, the Beckhams?  Who else do we know over there?  I think the Beckhams are there.  We know Elton John is there.  The McCartney or no?  Paul McCartney.  I think Sir Paul is there somewhere. 
[00:24:00]  Why haven't they shown him, though?  Who knows?  Maybe he's not.  Maybe he's not a thorn or something.  He would keep the state open.  Outside Westminster Abbey, a lot of people waiting.  Of course, I think they go back to Buckingham Palace for the reception.  Is that where they go?  For the big reception?  That must be like a hoity-toity fucking affair.  What an odd thing that's invited.  Probably not.  But there's a lot of people who probably got invited to the reception that didn't get to the room.  Oh, sure, sure. 
[00:24:30]  You have both made your decision today.  Her eyebrows or eyelids look weird.  Why is that?  I don't know.  Her eyebrows look very 1960s.  On the Zoom, maybe the middle one she looks a little bit better.  But she has big, dark eyebrows.  Jesus, her pussy must be fucking horrifying.  How great would it be if she just leaned over and started sucking his cock right there in the Westminster Abbey?  But you could say that no matter what's on television.  How great would it be if she began sucking his cock? 
[00:25:00]  It'd be fucking great.  If it wasn't my girlfriend courtside at the Lakers, I'd be happy.  Yes.  Officially, it's a two-minute delay.  Someone figured it out.  Wow.  That's crazy.  Because some things...  Oh, yeah.  It's going to go up to spread.  Right.  Look at that.  She's dressed like a peep.  She's dressed like a peep.  The queen.  The queen.  The queen.  The queen.  The fuck she really is.  I guess if you're the queen, you could wear yellow, right? 
[00:25:30]  You could wear piss yellow.  It's horrible.  Oh, she falls asleep in her dumb white gloves.  Well, she goes to scratch her ass, and then you see a little brown spot in the white glove.  And you realize the queen mom needs assisted bathroom usage.  Transform.  So long as you don't harm her.  I put my finger in his chocolate.  No, you haven't.  Giant screens out there.  Yeah, I see that.  For the people that couldn't make it in, of course, all over England. 
[00:26:00]  Look at the wonderful, stinky walking past our studios here on this great day.  This wonderful day.  Yes.  Young Garrett.  He's walked by.  Mastery.  Come in.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  The Sirius XM app is four to five minutes delay.  Yeah.  Hey, good luck to you.  Wow.  The Sirius XM app still has the fucking Charles Diana wedding going.  That's the reality of gold.  Where's she right now?  Lady Di's.  Why didn't they wheel that coffin into the fucking church?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they all junkets sing that same song again with the fucking 50th incarnation. 
[00:26:30]  Jesus.  A femur in the wind.  You know, because she's all bones now.  Well, they keep saying that she would have loved to have been there, so fucking bring her in.  She'd like to be anywhere.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Just bring the fucking coffin in and creep everyone out.  Just roll her in.  Roll her in.  Oh, her jaw dropped.  Oh, you don't have to go, like, something Indiana Jones dug up.  All right, that's sick now.  I didn't say open up the fucking thing.  Oh, okay. 
[00:27:00]  I'm sorry.  Just wheel the coffin.  Yeah, that is kind of sick.  Doty got the invite?  With you and your giant Arab cock cat.  Oh, no.  I don't think Doty's there.  No, Doty.  No.  This guy's still talking.  He won't stop.  The fuck does this mean?  You know they just want to fucking drink and party and do the chicken dance.  Rabbit stew coming up.  Incubate the coming world.  Yeah.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Scrooge.  Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  In their dumb uniforms. 
[00:27:30]  Metals tinkling as they're fucking doing the chicken dance.  Well, that's how my movie would end.  The big wedding scene where I marry the girl.  And I kind of loosen the royals up.  Oh, you do.  And we're all doing the crazy dance at the end.  And the queen's doing the crazy dance.  Oh, at the reception and stuff.  And I throw something up in the air and we all look up at it.  And then it would freeze frame.  And that's the end of the movie.  The credits start rolling over your freeze frame.  With like crazy, you know.  Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.  Like some kind of crazy 80s music.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, that would be a good one, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That way, which is expressed in the crowd. 
[00:28:00]  The flesh light.  Yeah, the bride actually is so loose that she throws the flesh light out at the crowd.  They're all covered in cum.  Yeah, I love that.  As they're fighting over it.  Like the bouquet.  The whole room smells like bleach.  Somebody slips and fucking gets a shin injury.  The queen gets a shin injury trying to walk up the steps.  And she slips on my cum.  And she cracks her shit on the marble steps. 
[00:28:30]  She's a fucking, what's that called when it sticks to the bone?  A compound fracture.  A compound fracture of the fucking fibula.  Of the tibia and the fibula.  And Alan Alda comes in.  For no reason, they play the mash theme music.  Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.  And he fixes her leg.  This movie makes no sense.  Yes, it does.  And then I'm taking a shit wearing Radar's hat.  With his dumb hand. 
[00:29:00]  His claw hand.  Exactly.  I'm trying to wipe with it, but I can't.  Inspiring words there from the Bishop of London.  Oh, inspiring words from the Bishop of London.  We missed inspiring words, guys.  He said to his bride as she arrived at the altar,  You look beautiful.  What was he supposed to say?  Yeah, exactly.  It was a very interesting story.  A young man called Paul Meagher, who wrote this,  and the special couple heard it up at St. Andrews,  and said, we want this at our wedding.  And he said, completely, oh, back to these old house.  To the young boys.  Oh, dear.  What a wonderful wedding. 
[00:29:30]  Woo!  How come no kids that can see are in the fucking choir?  I know.  They all wear glasses.  They all wear the same glasses.  Horrible eyes over there in England, I guess.  Fucking Ted Danson is leading the fucking clothes.  This whole thing is creeping me out.  Oh, you know that guy.  Meanwhile, they're on the honeymoon already, for real.  We're in such a long delay.  They've moved on.  That guy's just got the creepiest of creepy shit in his head, I'm sure.  I heard they're actually going to the Poconos, Mount Airy Lodge.  Are they in the big champagne glass?  Yeah, these royal bedbugs.  Yes, this is wonderful. 
[00:30:00]  Look, we've got a heart-shaped bed with mirrors on the ceiling, don't you know?  You'd be one of these people out front like that.  There's a lot of people out front.  Would you?  Would you just stand there?  Would you?  Would you?  We've hooked it a lot worse.  Look at that big furry hat from hundreds of years ago.  That's how they fought the Revolutionary War, dummies.  If a cat pissed on that hat right before the wedding, it would stink all day.  Can you imagine what a fucking guard at the Buckingham Palace with cat piss in his fucking hat would smell like it?  It would suck. 
[00:30:30]  They all have rosy red cheeks over there.  It's enraging.  Yeah, yeah, very rosy.  It's because they're pasty.  That guy didn't shave.  And now George Michael's jerking off in the bathroom.  He was invited, but he's still in the bathroom.  He's jacking it.  You hear drill sounds.  A hole saw trying to go through a stall at the Westminster Abbey.  Is that where this is?  Yeah, it's cool.  That's where the shit happens. 
[00:31:00]  That's where all the royal shit goes down.  Look at all the people outside watching on the big screens.  What a big event for the people of England.  Our brothers and sisters across the pond, as I like to say.  They've got a nice day, too.  Yeah, it's foggy, cold, and cloudy.  A wonderful day in England.  Horrible weather they get.  They're in the middle of the fucking ocean.  Dumb country.  Yeah.  Every one of those hats should be fucking removed in a vestibule in Brooklyn. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  Think you're a real rock and roller?  Oh, Fox News just tweeted, where would Diana be sitting if she were alive?  Get the fuck out of here.  Probably somewhere with a lot of fucking little hanging trees because she would stink.  Oh, she'd be alive?  Oh, yeah.  That joke she'd say.  Yeah, yeah.  And where do you think she'd be sitting?  Probably in the front row?  Of course. 
[00:32:00]  Exactly.  Please.  Oh, they'd be showing her like crazy.  On Colby Bryant's lap.  But she'd be an old broad.  Yeah.  She'd be an old broad right now, too.  Not looking like, you know.  She'd probably look all dignified and shit, but she would, you know.  Would she be 60 at this point?  How old would Lady Di be?  How old was that bitch when she passed away, Danny?  Danny, a little bit of info.  Danny's looking at that stat up right now.  I bet you she'd be 55.  Are you going with 55?  I think she was only in her early 40s when she died.  Yeah?  And that was, what, 12 years ago?  Because Charles looks pretty old.  Charles looks pretty old. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah, she was a little younger.  Oh, she was born in 61?  Oh, well, then I know how old she was.  She'd be 50.  50.  Wait a minute.  She was 36 when she died.  How long would she die?  She was 36 when she died.  That was August 31, 97.  It's more than 12 years.  90 cents, 14 years ago.  Wow.  I thought it was...  Damn.  Well, look at the guard walking.  Wonderful.  Oh, this kid gets a solo.  Oh, damn.  He gets a solo.  Look at him.  I feel like I'm watching the wall. 
[00:33:00]  This is great.  This kid's good.  Where's Roger Waters?  Yeah.  His hair will tussle.  You want to tussle that hair.  Oh, my God.  He has fucking Potsy Webber hair.  I love kids with Potsy Webber hair.  Cuter than a kid with fucking Anson Williams hair.  It's adorable.  Of course, you just want to take your hand and tussle his hair.  Message.  Let us pray.  Let us pray.  Let us pray.  Dear Lord, we ask of you all... 
[00:33:30]  Suck that cock.  I'd be firing out jokes left and right over there.  I'd be crazy.  Lord, have mercy upon us.  Why?  Take his hair like Mars.  Oh, shit.  Lord, have mercy upon us.  Our Father.  Lord, which art in heaven.  I'll listen to the S's on the...  Forgive us the trespasses.  We forgive those trespasses.  Give us this day our...  Do you hear it?  Listen to the S's.  And forgive us our trespasses. 
[00:34:00]  As we forgive them that trespass against us.  Lead us not into temptation.  But deliver us.  Deliver us.  Me be ill.  O Lord, save thy servant and thy handmaid.  Yes.  What?  Handjob.  Oh.  O Lord.  Sorry to start reading for the exorcism.  The book of exorcism.  Whoops.  Yeah.  The power of Christ compels you.  Casteth out.  This evil spirit. 
[00:34:30]  And she vomits pea soap.  We all have boners.  O Lord.  Hear our prayer.  Boo!  Boo!  Are you about to call me an asshole?  Are you about to call me an asshole?  Bless these thy servants.  Be more funny.  And sow the seed of eternal life in their hearts.  Oh, the seed of eternal life.  You know what that is.  Forever in thy holy word.  What is that?  He was banging cocktail waitresses two at a time.  May indeed fulfill the same. 
[00:35:00]  But so obeying thy will.  No!  And always being in safety under thy protection.  Oh, did you see that joke?  May I abide in thy love.  Soon as I get home, the first thing I'm going to do is punch your mama in the mouth.  Amen.  Amen.  I'd love to stand up when it's really quiet and just announce that my belly button stinks.  He said that I can smell your cunt. 
[00:35:30]  Messy hair guy already.  And grant that they may see their children Christianly and virtuously brought up.  He looks like the guy that did all the sitcoms.  Jesus Christ.  He was James Brooks.  Yeah, James Brooks.  Hey, I couldn't figure out his name.  Oh, God, who has taught us that it should never be lawful to put us on those whom thou by matrimony hadst made one.  Yes.  You're already married.  Enough with this shit.  The state of matrimony to such an excellent mystery that in it is signified and represented the spiritual marriage and unity betwixt Christ and his church. 
[00:36:00]  You're such a super lady.  Look mercifully upon these thy servants.  That both this man may love his wife according to thy word.  This is going great.  The church who gave himself for it, loving and cherishing it even as his own flesh.  And also that this woman may be loving and faithful to her husband.  And in all quietness, sobriety and peace, be a follower of holy and godly matrons. 
[00:36:30]  Sweep her and wine!  Bless them both.  And grant them to inherit thy everlasting kingdom.  Thy everlasting.  Through Jesus Christ.  Our Lord.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Almighty God, the Father of our Lord.  You know how fucking great a loud fart was out of that fucking room.  Oh, it just reverberates.  Oh, 20 minutes before it stops.  That ye may please him both in peace.  All right, old Larry Finehair.  Come on.  What are you doing?  Hey, I'm warning you. 
[00:37:00]  Hey, you're married.  I'm warning you over here.  I'd like to thank my hairdresser, Michael J. Fox.  In British history.  Jerusalem.  Britain.  What happened?  Music by Charles Parry.  Is that it?  End of story.  Edward Elgar.  What happened?  And every English rugby fan, and William is one of those, will know this word.  Yeah, they're playing a fiddle.  Look at this fucking mosquito on the drums. 
[00:37:30]  Is that it?  Is this the, uh...  Now they leave?  Yeah.  They leave.  Oh, get the fuck out.  Let's go.  Well, there's Elton John again.  Oh, there's Elton in his dumb wig.  He's the worst.  And there's his friend.  Yes, his good friend.  No, they're parents now, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What's that?  He's the only celebrity in the fucking crowd.  That's the only one you recognize.  Yeah, what the fuck?  Yeah.  All these dumb English people. 
[00:38:00]  Look at that guy.  How many Zulus did he kill in his day?  Holy shit.  Who is that again?  Prince Philip?  Prince Philip.  He's got medals up the ass, that motherfucker.  Does he?  What do those medals mean, though?  I don't know.  He fucking conquered some nation.  A lot of fake medals, you think?  Nah, they're probably real.  A lot of bullshit medals.  Falklands or something.  Hey, watch your language.  You say Falklands.  See, I wasn't...  I hurt my Falkland arms.  That's good.  Not a lot of Negroes there, I'm noticing. 
[00:38:30]  Very white audience.  They keep showing the Negroes, though.  Just a couple, though.  The crowd full of white people.  They're all wearing British flag hats.  Yes.  Perhaps they're all being robbed right now.  All these people are going to go home to furniture-less homes.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Little English fucking...  Turd?  I fancied her.  Turd?  I guess Mancow's there.  Turd?  He's walking through the crowd looking for turd. 
[00:39:00]  Ah, turd?  What are you doing now?  Turd, you're driving on the wrong side of the road, turd.  What's up?  Wow.  Mike's been picking up a lot of stuff in the crowd.  Oh, wow.  All right, they're just waving their flags.  Razzle-dazzle.  Yes, there is a lot of razzle-dazzle going on.  That's going to be a long walk for these guys. 
[00:39:30]  That is.  My God.  That Abbey is long.  Abbey normal.  Woo!  Wonderful.  If you were the prince, why wouldn't you pick up that blonde instead?  I know.  From the crowd.  There's some...  Oh, what?  Pray it again.  Oh, almighty Lord and everlasting God.  Wow.  Very religious.  To direct, sanctify...  What would happen, though, if she had the squirts all of a sudden?  Just blasted liquid diarrhea. 
[00:40:00]  She said to him, I've got to shit.  I can't wait.  Please hold it, love.  For the mighty protection, both here and ever, we may be preserved in body and soul.  Yeah.  Through our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Amen.  Ah, what the Christ.  The blessing of God almighty, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.  I've got it.  Right.  Good.  Be amongst you.  Number four.  And remain with you always. 
[00:40:30]  You're a fucking liar.  All right.  More with the singing.  Oh, God.  If this doesn't make you not want to go to church, you nothing will.  I know.  And he raised the roof.  Raised the roof?  It's high enough already.  Exactly.  The place is huge.  See how high that roof is?  Yeah.  Yeah, raise that roof.  Yeah.  You could pogo stick in there.  Oh, more cherubish children.  I know.  Their bad eyesight.  Yes.  I'd like to thank our director, Gary Glitter.  Christ, it's nothing but fucking kids and nerds. 
[00:41:00]  Kids, nerds, and incest fucking world people.  A chess champion right there.  Yeah, there you go.  How did he get in?  Oh, look at those stained glass windows.  Yeah.  Frank Sabatka's is right there.  Here it is.  This is the big song that they leave to, right?  Wow, that's some pomp right there.  Either that or a little bit of circumstance.  Another bad Emerson Lake and Palmer song.  Yeah, that does sound like an ELP.  Wow, that's like real horns and shit. 
[00:41:30]  That's pretty cool.  This is Lord of the Rings stuff right here.  Someone missed a note there.  No, no, no, no.  It was a nice little rough.  He's a good drummer, this guy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, we won't.  Sweet land of liberty  Of thee I sing  We stole this song from, by the way. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, wow.  Oh, yeah.  It's God Save the Queen, but we made it our, like, little...  They must be pissed that we changed the words, huh?  Fuck them.  We kicked their ass in the big war.  She's wearing a Frisbee on her head.  Oh, my God.  That was.  Hat by Wham-O.  And there's the peep again.  I didn't realize that this was from fucking England.  Yeah.  Let freedom ring.  Let freedom ring.  Let freedom ring.  It's God Save the Queen.  Oh, so they changed it.  Let freedom ring, yeah. 
[00:42:30]  We changed it to motherfuck them.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a motherfuck them.  I never knew that.  It's like, fuck you, man.  We won our independence.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  We don't have to put up with this shit.  Are there Kate's sister?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Bring this fucking bitch up.  Amazing scene.  Look at that ass.  Look at this thing.  Oh, what a rump.  She's probably got nerve sweat running down the crack of her ass, though.  Yeah.  I'm not going to have the bride and bride and bride.  If you fucking taste it, it's a little salty down there.  It's fine.  No.  A little, a little, a little.  The signing of the marriage registers.  Oh.  No one's ever tongued me there. 
[00:43:00]  Oh.  Blimey.  That feels good.  What do you think?  Give a date?  Who do you think is going to make the move on Kate's sister?  I don't know.  Maybe the reception.  Maybe the brother.  You think the brother?  Is he single?  No.  No, I can't do that.  He's a wild.  Probably some friend of the family that they didn't want to invite.  Yeah.  Have a fucking Cialis heart on.  Pressing it against the back of her hands.  Some old drunk duke.  She's rubbing on her knuckles while she's trying to talk to the queen. 
[00:43:30]  They're leaving.  She's carrying her dress.  God, she has a fucking nice hiding.  I got a fucking...  What's her name?  Kate's sister?  Just Kate's sister.  Kate's sister.  Who cares?  All right.  They're going somewhere.  I don't know where they're going.  Fight for wedding pictures.  Yeah?  That's going to be a six-hour affair.  I'm absolutely crying.  I'm by the photons.  I can't help it.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I came from Buckingham Palace with two bad knees and a dream to be at the royal wedding. 
[00:44:00]  I didn't think I got my dreams.  I can't help it.  I'm absolutely crying over here.  Wow, that camera's up high.  Damn, look at that shit.  How do they get the camera up there?  I don't know.  It's crazy.  That's some crazy-ass shit.  It's a nice slow pullback from a archway.  Yeah.  High atop the Westminster Abbey.  You know how fun it would be to drop cum balloons from that height? 
[00:44:30]  Just be perched up there.  No one could get you anytime soon.  Dive upon those hats with huge balloons full of jigs.  Yeah, on their shoulders.  He's really in the event.  How inappropriate.  How inappropriate.  Just pee from up there.  Down on the crowd.  I like the thought they can't get you anytime soon while this whole thing's going on.  They've got to find the 80-foot ladder.  Oh, it would be crazy.  80.  How high do you think that is?  Oh, my God.  It's got to be 8,000 feet. 
[00:45:00]  8,000?  I'm not saying that.  Pippa is the sister.  Thank you for that knowledge.  Pippa.  Pippa.  I thought you'd yell that out.  Pippa?  Pippa.  That's a horrible name.  Hey, Pippa.  You'd just say, oh, you're a Pip.  Is that a real name?  Pippa Middleton?  Pippa.  That's English.  Some wackiness going on.  That's a terrible fucking name.  Oh, lick my balls, Pippa.  Glasses.  Oh, playing the violins very nice. 
[00:45:30]  Wow, that guy's into it.  He really is.  He kills the cameras on him.  He saw the red light.  He's like a face.  It's your moment.  More frisbee hats.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Is that Pippa Middleton right there?  Look at her with the fucking pink leg warmers and shit.  Let me see her.  Where?  Where are we going now?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, she's beautiful.  She's a party girl.  I like a good three-foot neck.  She's sexy.  She should be swimming in fucking Loch Ness.  Nice neck, whore.  Pippa.  Who's Pippa dating?  You guys recognize any of these assholes? 
[00:46:00]  They're showing the crowd.  I do.  Is that Mel Karmeson?  Did he make it?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Mel made it.  Holy shit.  What?  I do.  I do.  I do.  I love you. 
[00:46:30]  Sounds like the end of a John Wayne western.  I know.  He's riding off.  Riding off into the sunset with his bra.  Watching it on old TV.  Everybody's real thin and too long as the credits roll.  I hate that. 
[00:47:00]  That's really cool.  It was so annoying as a kid.  You knew the movie was over.  Yeah.  I remember watching Kelly's Heroes and seeing everybody.  Clint Eastwood getting all skinny and the tanks.  We'd get all thin and then the credits roll.  You're a wanker.  Fuck you.  Who's that?  I don't know who those two are.  That's one of those princesses, right?  Is it?  No, it's probably a duchess and a duke.  Is that a princess?  I think it's a duchess and a duke.  I'm going to have some cool seats. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  There's a great section of seats there.  I know those guys get individual lamps.  Time for love, Dr. Jones.  When did they walk out?  Oh, they already left.  Now it's just everybody's standing there.  They left?  How come they leave through the little doorway by the altar there?  They went through the side door?  Instead of turning around and taking the red carpet back out.  Maybe they gave them a bathroom break.  And now everybody else has to stand there and listen to these dumb kids singing.  Singing. 
[00:48:00]  By the way, this is your exclusive wedding coverage.  Oh, really?  For Prince William, yes.  We are covering the wedding for you people.  And I think we're doing the best job you're going to get.  Yeah, we're covering it ten minutes later, which is great.  Yeah, yeah.  That's great for everybody.  Exactly.  Maybe we could have turned off some of these delays for this.  It's the same shot of this fucking Abbey. 
[00:48:30]  We get it.  I know.  They've run out of shots to show us.  They really have.  Back to the Cherub Kids.  Yeah.  Little rosy-faced children.  What do you think they had to do to get that spot in this wedding?  Oh, boy.  I don't even want to know.  Think their parents sold them out?  Oh, yeah.  The guy that's leading this little chorus? 
[00:49:00]  Forget about it.  You think he had auditions?  Oh, yeah.  Look at that ghoul.  They like their frills.  But I don't want to be a pirate.  They're wearing the puffy shirts from the Seinfeld episode.  People are saying it sounds like the scene when Rocky's about to fight Drago in Rocky IV.  Oh, yeah?  Because it's the same type of music, right?  Yeah. 
[00:49:30]  I wish they'd show the royal couple again.  I'm tired of looking at this singing bullshit.  More info, thank you.  I guess people are hearing the real coverage so they can help us out.  They're signing the registry, the marriage registry in the back.  Oh, is that what they do in the back?  So this is like a little filler.  Then they come back out, and I guess they're going to walk that fucking red carpet.  Oh, then they walk the red carpet?  Oh, yeah.  All right.  A lot of people.  That'll be the big get for this coverage.  Eagerly awaiting their re-entry into the main hall of the Abbey. 
[00:50:00]  So then they will then egress down the red carpet.  And you think we're going to see any waving to the crowd, Opie, once they get outside?  Or you think they'll go right to the vehicles and off to Buckingham Palace?  Well, I sure hope they wave.  I do, too.  I'm packing on there.  We're going to wave to the crowds that are waiting out there to see them, see the beautiful dress.  But the queen won't wave.  A couple of royal guards on their horses. 
[00:50:30]  The queen is hunched over.  Why would they have that weirdo sitting right behind the queen with that Lady Gaga look?  The Lady Gaga hat.  Well, I think they're showing a contrast, Opie, of old and new.  This, of course, is the newer generation of royal.  That hat is retarded.  It's on the side of her hand, and it looks like the front of a Pratt & Whitney jet engine.  She looks like Omar's grandmother.  That dumb hat. 
[00:51:00]  Stupid hat.  Her crown, y'all.  Her Sunday crown.  On a Sunday morning, y'all shut up the church.  They've been making it sound like they shot his grandma in the ass.  Oh, the queen dabbing some tears?  Maybe she just had an itchy eye.  She's got an itchy eye.  I don't think she's ever cried.  Prince William spit in her face.  What's that guy's name?  The cuckold?  Oh, the cuckold?  Prince Charles.  Philip.  Oh, Prince Philip.  And now what?  What happens now?  Now some of the royal entourage, I guess the... 
[00:51:30]  Coming out of the back.  Coming out of the back.  Filing out.  They all made their duties.  Yes.  They took their shites.  Yeah.  Now what the hell's going on?  Why are they showing...  Wait, what happened?  Fox 5 is showing the vows.  Fox 5 went back to the vows.  Oh, they're recapping on the local news here.  Why are they recapping?  They're getting divorced already.  We're way behind.  That's ridiculous, because they ran out of shit, too. 
[00:52:00]  Just like us.  Yeah.  Enough of the singing to get to the fucking point.  Now they're...  I guess the bishops are coming out.  The chess pieces.  Hopefully soon we'll...  Yeah.  I liked when you said that.  Yeah, yeah.  The chess pieces.  Soon we'll see...  They're coming out on a diagonal, trying to figure out how to get to the center again.  Yes.  Bishops.  There's a rook.  Walking down the red carpet now, some guy dressed in curtains. 
[00:52:30]  There they go.  Do they walk outside in front of everybody, or no?  That's the big question, Jim.  I'm glad you brought that up.  Will they be addressing and waving to the crowd gathered outside the abbey?  Or, for time or security's sake, will they go right to their cars and drive to Buckingham Palace?  Well, they would walk outside.  We'll see.  We will see.  They would walk outside, at least, right? 
[00:53:00]  The reception is...  Where is the reception going to be?  You know it's a Radisson toy.  Ah, Radisson.  Oh, the Radisson?  Yeah, yeah.  It's a Radisson toy.  It's pretty good.  And who's going to be singing at the reception?  You know.  Because if we see him, you've got no complaints.  Yeah.  Nice.  It's true.  That's a big get.  This is like some ancient shit they're doing here.  This is the shit that was going on during, like, the plague and shit.  Yeah, this was right before they put a woman's vagina on a stake and opened it because she 
[00:53:30]  wouldn't admit she was a witch.  Fucking asshole British.  Fucking Spanish Inquisition.  Oh, yeah.  Wrong country.  Sorry, Britain.  Oh, Stephen S. from Bayshore has got some knowledge.  I just heard on Fox that the Queen is wearing shoes made from the breast skin of Princess  Di.  Wow.  So it's very nice of her to acknowledge Princess Di at this wedding.  At least part of her is there.  That's very nice.  In spirit and breast.  This is a household cabaret.  What?  By trumpet major Grant, Stuart Jones, band of blues and royals. 
[00:54:00]  The organ.  The organ.  The name of the Robert Quinney.  Some organs to Westminster Abbey.  See, right now they're getting ready for them to walk out.  Yeah.  Two files.  This will be the climax of my movie.  Oh, really?  Where I walk out and they're all like, oh, it's him.  And I'm, like, making funny faces and walking crazy down the aisle.  Master person.  Westminster Abbey.  All right, here they are.  All right.  Emerging from the back.  Oh, please don't let her trip.  Please let her trip. 
[00:54:30]  Yeah, I know.  Oh, my God.  Her sister's so upstaging this broad.  Yeah.  Look at her sister.  And why doesn't fucking William's brother get in there?  Get closer to that broad.  I know.  What's he doing?  Look at him in his uniform looking all dapper.  He's probably embarrassed.  He's nervous.  His breath stinks.  She doesn't want to lean in and talk to her with fucking dried tea breath.  Here they go.  Wait a minute.  Oh, they got to address the queen. 
[00:55:00]  The stupid queen.  So the bride there, she just did a little.  Oh, she's looking at her hiney.  She genuflected to the queen.  The queen looked at her hiney.  A little curtsy or something.  The queen's just a stiff boar.  She sucks.  The camera's going to a filter shot because of the glare coming off of William's head.  Poor bastard.  You know something, Prince William, if you're listening to the Opie and Anthony show, you  can get a harvest area where they will take follicles and individually place them in the  natural direction.  Your hair grows very artistically, so you won't have to deal with that comb over. 
[00:55:30]  He's got horrible hair.  Oh, he does.  It looks like they put a little cotton candy on top to make it look fuller.  Yeah, yeah, they teased it up a little bit.  A lot of hairspray.  I want to go on a date with Pip Middleton.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  I want to take Pip Middleton to a fucking, uh, to a steakhouse here in the city.  Oh, that'd be nice.  She's an outback bride.  Jimmy Norton.  Yes, he was lovely.  What a wonderful evening with Jimmy Norton. 
[00:56:00]  He didn't want me to wipe after I'd take off.  It was so bizarre.  He licked my naughty bits, yes.  I cut a stinker and he put his face by my bum.  As they, uh, walk down the red carpet, uh, what a wonderful, uh, uh, view.  The train, uh, going over the red carpet like that, now not being held by the hot sister.  Well, Prince William sucks at walking. 
[00:56:30]  You see that?  He's all wobbling.  Well, he's got to walk slow.  Uh, everyone wants to get a good view of this royal couple, uh, as they leave the abbey.  I think she's pretty, but she's not playing.  Ah, the eyebrows.  The eyebrows suck.  Yeah, he's married Brooke Shields.  Prince William, uh, acknowledging certain people in the crowd with a little wink.  Yeah.  With a smile.  And once again, he lost another 10% of his hair.  Yes.  Just walking down.  He's leaving, uh, a lot of fur on that red carpet.  There's somebody, uh, behind him with one of those sticky roller things. 
[00:57:00]  Just trying to clean the hair off the, uh, red carpet.  As he loses it by the second.  Yeah, with a leaf blower.  Poor bastard.  What the fuck's up with his hair?  Oh, it's just awful.  Terrible hair.  Uh, you're not.  Lady Di would be so proud if she wasn't, uh, completely decomposed with a box.  Yeah, exactly.  Somewhere in Wales.  Her fucking teeth hadn't gone through the fucking windshield of a fucking Mercedes in a tunnel. 
[00:57:30]  But they did, so she's not.  She would have been there today.  Yeah, she would have.  If, if, if she had a square asshole, she'd shit break.  I don't want to hear that shit.  What are they walking around in?  What are they walking around?  What is that?  Uh, I don't know, it's some type of, uh, it must be some, uh, holy thing in the church.  Uh, Prince William, um, can finally put a hat on.  Can put a, yeah, I think he's, they handed him his hat. 
[00:58:00]  His hat!  Uh, here they come out of the abbey to the cheers and admiration of all of, uh, Britain.  As they stop at the entrance, there's a photo op, people.  Uh, now they continue their walk down the red carpet.  Yeah.  Oh, and the, the crowd goes, what?  Unbelievable.  Of all the dramatic things I've ever seen, goodness gracious! 
[00:58:30]  As you're hearing this, by the way, they're on their way to the reception.  I hate that we're on an 11-minute delay.  It's humiliating.  Yes, it really is, but what are you going to do?  Wow, the, the crowd now throwing, uh, what looks like confetti.  No, that was Prince William's hair.  Oh, oh, sorry, I thought it was a confetti storm.  It must be a little breezy there.  They say, what the hell, we might as well put it to good use.  A beautiful horse-drawn carriage pulling up in front of Westminster Abbey, uh, where I gather the new bride and groom, uh, will, will enter and make their way to, uh, to a Buckingham Palace. 
[00:59:00]  Uh, very, very traditional, I'd say.  Wow.  This is like my wedding I had with my lovely bride as we left, uh, the Justice of the Peace to go to an OTB so I could bet on the Preakness before we went to a titty bar, uh, and had some beers.  Well, that's just the same thing.  This is exactly like it. 
[00:59:30]  Why did he put on white gloves?  He has to wave with white gloves?  Oh, yes.  That's so they could see the hand.  Oh, is that what it is?  I have no idea.  I'm so stupid.  I'm just babbling through this.  Yeah.  Rambling on.  He should be serving lemon meringue pie on a train in 1950 with stupid white gloves.  Oh, another fact coming in from Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Kate has Velcro under the back of her dragging dress in order to pick up Willie's, uh, hair.  Oh, oh, two birds with one stone.  That's why her train was not being held on the red carpet. 
[01:00:00]  Very smart.  It's to pick up the hair that has fallen off of William's head.  How mad do you think people would be if the Royals had sold Ed Space on his hat that he's wearing?  It would be put on and it just said GoDaddy.com on the back of his hat.  She looks nice there.  She's all right.  I want to see Pip.  Yeah.  Those bushy eyebrows.  Oh, they would drive me nuts.  That means everyone's going to start growing bushy eyebrows now.  What the fuck?  Um, a lack of, uh, people tearing up at this wedding. 
[01:00:30]  Why would ya?  I, uh, thought Elton would have started crying.  No.  He's already married.  He doesn't care.  He knows the L with marriage.  Yeah.  And there goes the horse-drawn carriage.  Uh, what a dream come true for this young, uh, bride who will now be a, a, I believe, the Duke and Duchess of something.  Yeah.  Um, Cambridge, Danny.  Cambridge.  Is that what it is?  Is that it?  The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  What? 
[01:01:00]  That's who they're going to be.  Yeah, yeah.  What?  Yes.  Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  Why Cambridge?  Say, Lord and Lady, a douche bag.  That was a great fit.  Yes, uh, well, they've been given Cambridge, I guess.  Is that good?  I don't know.  It's probably some choice real estate.  Do you know how many of these guys with them right now are security?  Oh, yeah.  Like, there's three guys behind them all dressed like fucking creeps.  Absolutely.  Those guys have M-16s on them.  Al-Qaeda would love to be able to yell, Allah Akbar, uh, and just fucking run into that carriage. 
[01:01:30]  Well, they must have frisked everybody going through.  Oh, yes.  Security.  And dogs, yeah.  At a maximum.  I'm surprised that they're allowing them to go with an open top like that.  Open top, you think?  Yeah.  And they're going to make a left on Elm.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, look at the plane.  Don't make the left.  Yeah.  And the stupid queen.  And there's the queen.  Oh, Camilla.  Is that Camilla?  Yeah.  Parker Bowles.  Queen just wants to be left alone.  She just keeps talking to her.  Yeah, shut up. 
[01:02:00]  Look at the uniforms on the royal procession.  Very traditional.  With the hunting caps on and the royal armor.  What a scene we're seeing here.  Yeah.  As they make their way around the courtyard of the Abbey.  I know.  That's what I'm saying.  You did just say that.  Yeah, Anderson, shut up.  We got this.  Exactly.  Shut up.  We got this, Anderson.  They are married.  Anderson's looking at all those things with tassels. 
[01:02:30]  I don't know if he can sit on them.  Turn off Anderson's mic.  We got this.  Oh, enough with you, Anderson.  Yeah, shut up.  An amazing sight, Anderson.  It's not an amazing sight.  It's an amazing sight.  I know.  She shit her pants.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  What a service.  Just perfectly pitched.  Ah, yeah.  What do you mean perfectly pitched?  It sounded like 20 weddings I've been to.  William's name, right?  What was different about that? 
[01:03:00]  Yes.  It's true.  It's true.  It's true.  It's true.  She just held herself together.  She just has such poise.  I think it's remarkable.  It will be cool.  And we're going to see a procession.  Everybody loves a royal wedding.  If only the mother lady die were here.  No, she's dead.  What happened to her?  She was very badly raped, you see.  Try the wine.  I wish I had control over the mics.  I'd love to just pipe that into the church while they're talking. 
[01:03:30]  Not since Charles and...  All right.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Yeah.  Which was a procession.  I don't know.  I've had the foliage and sword.  Yeah.  As you were saying earlier...  Now what do they do?  It does feel like...  They party.  They're going the wrong way down that street.  How great would it be if an overzealous cop stopped the horse?  What if the horse just started shitting all over the place?  The queen slipped in it.  They're going to party like it's $16.99. 
[01:04:00]  It's very traditional.  Whoa.  What happened to that one horse?  Oh, they're breaking off a little bit.  Oh, they're breaking off.  Two million people joining in this celebration.  You can hear the cheers of the English people.  Just happy.  National holiday, by the way, in England.  Why?  Well, just for this wedding, Opie.  They've made a national holiday.  No one's at work.  What do you make?  Their stock market is closed.  And they're all out to celebrate this great day. 
[01:04:30]  The royal wedding.  Yet another royal wedding.  Will they be the king and queen or no?  No!  Is that Santa's sleigh?  Yes.  The guards are out.  The two horses chatting with each other.  I want to know if they're going to be...  He's going to be king someday, right?  Yeah.  Well, it'll be another 50 years or so.  Dead first.  It's a long time.  It is.  Prince Charles hasn't even gotten his shot yet.  I know.  You know how annoying it's going to be  if the queen fucking drops dead 
[01:05:00]  and Charles has cancer?  Ugh.  To give it right to this kid?  Yeah.  They've got longevity in this dumb family, so...  Oh, yeah.  The best medical care.  Prince William's not going to be a king anytime soon.  Yeah.  And this really is making a grand statement  on a world stage.  It's one of the most beautiful dresses  I think I've ever seen in my life.  How would you know?  One of the most beautiful dresses  he's ever seen in his life.  Oh, Piers is really chiming in there.  Doesn't her wedding dress look like a wedding dress?  No, I wouldn't say.  The difference between a good one and a bad one.  Look at the ass on fucking Pitt Middleton.  Saluting. 
[01:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  She has a nice shitter on her.  She sure does.  What a dumper.  I know which one is live.  Here they go.  Through Buckingham Palace gates.  I have no idea.  Looks like the palace gates, doesn't it?  I don't know.  Have you ever been there?  No, I went once years ago.  Oh, yes.  I think it's a very feminine dress.  And I think the use of corsetry,  which McQueen is very well known for,  does that brilliantly.  Yes, brilliantly.  It's a tiara as well.  It was the Queen Mother's tiara.  But this is great. 
[01:06:00]  And American viewers will love this  because there's a King's Speech link here  because this tiara, it turns out,  was made by Cartier in 1936.  But it was bought by the Duke of York  who became King George VI.  Oh, that is interesting.  Yeah, the Duke of York.  Very interesting to American listeners.  He's right.  We do like that.  Yeah.  It's not interesting at all.  No.  You know what would be interesting?  If he said,  this was found in David Berkowitz's glove compartment.  But it was so lovely,  she decided to wear it. 
[01:06:30]  Now, that would be interesting.  Yes.  Her ring was actually a cock ring  worn by Richard Ramirez.  That's very interesting.  That's interesting.  He's doing that wacky salute.  That fucking...  Someone had a great line on Twitter.  Yeah.  Hi, me.  When the choir was doing their thing,  the longest intro to  you can't always get what you want ever.  Oh.  Very good to that person.  A personal statement  as to who she really is. 
[01:07:00]  It's not only about the...  Well, we're going to learn about her.  I mean, I think it's...  We absolutely are going to learn about Kate  over the years.  A prostitution busting her pants.  Wouldn't that be great?  Oh, it would be great.  And what is appropriate.  No one checked into it.  I think she's showing the world  that she's not here to...  Look at these colonizing pricks.  Oh, my God.  Do you know how many unhappy countries  have seen this view?  I know.  Just a bunch of horses  with those tassel hats.  Horses coming at them.  And I think that... 
[01:07:30]  Red jacket.  Okay, we're in charge now, then.  I think it's not only  an emotional statement...  What a beautiful dress, yes.  ...a realistic one.  And my...  It really wasn't an interesting thing  for American viewers.  No.  King's speech tie-in  kind of stunk.  Behind her face.  It feels very complex to cut.  How far are they going?  Come in all different shapes and sizes.  They have to get to the airport  because they have a flight booked  to Pennsylvania.  I'm telling you,  they're going to Mount Harry Lodge.  Mount Harry Lodge. 
[01:08:00]  He's doing the Benny Hill salute.  The voice of Vera Wang.  Why are we listening to Vera Wang?  Vera Wang designed  many celebrities' wedding gowns.  And I guess she's an expert on this.  Well, she's pissed off  she didn't get this gig, though.  Yeah, well...  Would have been good for her business.  Who designed the royal tampon  that she's wearing?  You think it's a special tampon?  Yes, it's a fucking crew sock  wrapped around something holy.  No doubt we have got 
[01:08:30]  a new superstar in Kate Middleton.  A new superstar in Kate Middleton.  Yes.  That's right.  I hope she keeps giving bad clothes.  I'm not touching an AIDS patient.  A minefield.  You had your bloody mind.  Fuck the minefield.  Her life's never going to be...  Oh, yes.  A little crying towel.  That's why Piers has this fucking gig  because he says her life's  never going to be the same.  Yeah.  That's a guy who knows journalism.  He knows his shit.  Excellent point, Piers.  This really, I think, all goes well. 
[01:09:00]  You think that's their version  of Secret Service behind them?  Those two guys?  Sitting right there?  Yes.  Well, they've been practicing long enough.  Oh, good God!  They're showing...  Of what lies ahead.  Prince Harry and his date.  Yeah, Prince Harry  and his four-year-old date.  Because they could get away  with that over there.  Everybody on those rules.  Everybody on those horses  is a Secret Service for them.  Secret Service.  You think?  Yeah.  It's not a good secret, though.  No.  They're on horses  dressed in gold helmets.  And they have fucking machine guns  under their fucking outfits. 
[01:09:30]  All the newspapers...  Later, Kate, by the way...  This will be interesting  to English listeners.  Later, Kate will be wearing  a Roman war helmet  in bed  during the honeymoon.  If she knows what's good for her.  If she knows what's good for her.  Yes.  She will then have  an onion-smelling  bridge of her nose.  And him and his fledgling erection  as he puts it in  and it just keeps going soft.  Nobody knows that,  but he has erection difficulties. 
[01:10:00]  The Union Jack  displayed prominently  down the boulevard  that they are taking.  Just amazing.  What pride for England  was built for all of the kingdom,  I would think.  ...1902  to be used in his bonnet.  Those horses are very nice.  They are beautiful.  Big horse dicks dangling.  Yes.  Giant horse cock.  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ... 
[01:10:30]  ...  Very close.  So we're getting to the...  They are saying hello  to the crowd,  greeting the millions  and billions on television  that have come out  to see this wonderful day.  Jim Norton.  The Queen's inside.  I wonder why.  Wonderful white horses.  What a fairy tale wedding.  And speaking of fairies,  Elton John  making his way  to Buckingham Palace.  A fairy tale  is Elton's hiney. 
[01:11:00]  Oh yes,  Elizabeth and Philip  are in there.  Yes.  They're in another  horse-drawn carriage.  Absolutely right,  Anderson,  and here they come.  You can see the way  the flags.  Oh my God.  Absolutely.  Goodness gracious.  The Duke knew.  What must they be thinking?  She's a couple of minutes  now away from Buckingham Palace.  Just a couple of minutes  away from Buckingham Palace.  There is one man  who's got an awful lot 
[01:11:30]  of pressure on him now.  Oh, to get an erection.  Yeah.  To get her pregnant, right?  Yeah.  He's going to be trying  to push his fucking  completely soft dick  into her later.  He's going to use  what you call  the thumb splint  when you've got to  use your thumb  to try to push it in,  push the head down  and into the vagina.  Yeah.  Because once you're in  and pumping,  then you're okay.  But the nerves,  very nervous  on his wedding night,  I'm sure.  Yeah.  The way the fucking 
[01:12:00]  one king stuttered,  his cock stutters.  That's what happens to him.  The king's erection.  Sorry, I'm just  tearing up here  and I have to blow my nose.  Yeah.  I'm absolutely crying.  Yeah.  We're just about  done with this, right?  I hope not.  I want to do this  all day.  They're making their way  into Buckingham Palace.  That's where we'll stop  our whole shit.  Yeah.  Our coverage ends  and then we'll recap  the whole thing.  Will we?  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  No.  Look at that guy.  Nice wig.  Oh my God.  There's the big circle  in front of Buckingham Palace.  Is that the palace?  Yes, yes.  By the way,  the fact that I asked  that excitedly,  I should really have  my fucking face  slapped in a bunch of cocks.  Fucking coffee clutch bitch.  Is that the palace?  No.  I think Jimmy  secretly likes this.  Yes.  How many pictures  would you have gotten today?  None.  Oh my God.  The tonight show,  they have somebody over there.  I forget who they sent.  Why didn't you go? 
[01:13:00]  No, they got somebody  who was right for this.  I'm not right for this.  I'm going to the Kentucky Derby.  I'm right for that.  The big statue,  I believe,  was erected in 1783,  which commemorates,  I have no idea.  I'd actually like to go over there  just to get the airline miles.  I wouldn't even care  if I couldn't go to the wedding.  That is good.  Where would you go?  Virgin?  Virgin Atlantic.  Yeah,  that's supposed to be a good airline.  There's the gates  and the horse-drawn carriage  going through the gates. 
[01:13:30]  Of course,  if you're watching this at home,  this happened two minutes ago.  If they lead the procession in,  for what I can only imagine,  it's going to be  one hell of a party  at Buckingham Palace.  It's going to get crazy in there?  Wow, insane.  They're going to fucking dance  to hip-hop music.  See the queen dancing  like old school hip-hop music.  That's in my movie.  Is it?  Yes.  Because that's always funny  when the old white broad  dances to the hip-hop.  Look out, Royals.  That's what it's called.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:14:00]  A Royal Payne.  Oh.  That's what you are.  Oh, but my name's  P-A-Y-N-E.  Right.  That's my name  and it's Bill Payne.  Bill Payne  and it'll be a Royal Payne.  Yeah.  Oh, and you'll just...  People won't like you at first  but then they're going to  take to you  because you're so...  Your personality is great  and they'll start dancing  and taking your lead.  I wear a condom  made of sea urchin.  And it does seem  like from another time  and yet it's right here 
[01:14:30]  and very much alive.  Thanks.  Excellent point.  That was wonderful.  Very insightful.  Turn off this mic.  We got this.  I want to hear Laura Logan talk.  They're transforming  into a modern monarchy.  Anderson is just looking  at some of those horses  and thinking about  a video from Oregon  and a friend that said,  Oopsie.  Sorry, pal.  I think they've just  shown everyone's name.  Sorry.  You see here,  Mr. Hands gets cocky  and...  Sorry, pal.  I was distracted.  Yes, very distracted.  Sorry about that.  It's hard to make your hands  a cock ring on a horse.  It really is. 
[01:15:00]  Mr. Ed is tearing up to this.  You know when friends  get a great gig  because he has a pot conviction  he wasn't allowed  into the country?  He knows boys  are doing that.  We should tell you  where they're heading now.  They're at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen is giving  a lunchtime reception for him.  That lunchtime reception.  What a boy setting.  That's going to be wild,  Opie.  It's going to be wild.  There's going to be  about 600 people at this.  It's not a sit-down  breakfast or lunch.  It's actually buffet style,  which is quite unusual.  Buffet?  What? 
[01:15:30]  Oh, they're actually inside.  Try the fricassee.  They're not going to be  passing the tongs  to one another?  It's not an orientation.  Oh, stop.  They're making buffet jokes.  They're not passing the tongs.  CNN's getting crazy now.  Now, they're saying jokes.  I'm looking live.  I guess that's in the United States.  They're showing somewhere.  A lot of the English pubs  and whatnot here in the city  celebrating here in New York City.  They're celebrating.  Yes, yes.  Well, making sure her train  is just perfect 
[01:16:00]  as she exits her force-drawn carriage  and makes her way  into the palace.  Do you mind if I jumped in  for a picture real quick?  Yeah.  Can I get a photo?  No.  They're just standing there.  Prince William with a big smile  for an adorable young boy  that is on the steps  waiting to get his hair  to household.  The queen is just now arriving.  No.  Also at Buckingham Palace. 
[01:16:30]  How are they not tired of her?  God, I hate her.  She's been around forever.  I mean, can you imagine  leading this?  She cut off the oxygen  to fly in that carriage right now.  Get rid of the old bra.  Get rid of the air off.  Pipe in some exhaust cumes.  Good old days.  That's a great place  to cut a gasser.  Oh, my God.  That's what the queen's fart  smells like in that thing.  Queen should've just been  eating prunes all morning.  Like a rotting possum.  She has a nervous queen stomach.  She's filled up her diapers.  She has on frilly Depends. 
[01:17:00]  Prince Philip's such a cuckold.  He's got to just fucking deal  with it and smell it.  Wow, that's her.  Oh, look at her.  That's Kate?  No, that's...  Is that Pippa?  Yeah, yeah.  That's Kate Middleton.  Look at her vaginal bulge.  Yeah.  Who is that?  You think Prince William's  going to know what to do  with that?  No, he's going to give her  a stiff, lousy fucking...  Just like his father.  Be a lousy fuck  just like your father.  Who are the guys with her?  Is that fucking...  I think that's William, right? 
[01:17:30]  This marriage will survive.  Yeah.  And the guy close to her vagina  is just a bold maintenance man.  It's Owen Wilson.  Taking a nice look.  Yeah, taking a nice close look  at her camel toe.  I would like a picture  of Pip in a fucking bikini.  Yeah?  She couldn't be queen  because her vag bulge  is too big.  You know how much  I'd love to date a girl  who couldn't be royalty  because of her pussy bulge?  Pussy bulge too big.  The queen turned her down.  Wow, what a procession  going into Buckingham Palace.  Yeah. 
[01:18:00]  Wow, look at the crowd  out there.  It's just amazing.  It's like a rock concert.  Millions of people out  looking at this  on big screens  that have been erected  for people that  aren't good enough.  Is that Bonnaroo?  It really does look  like something  a live aid or something.  That would be a good concert.  Yes.  Now there's Prince Andrew  and his daughters  returning to Buckingham Palace.  Oh, yes.  Wonderful.  Now you definitely  want to stay tuned  because...  No, we don't.  No, we don't.  We're done.  I think we're not done  for breakfast.  Yeah. 
[01:18:30]  Please.  What else is that really?  Do you have cameras inside  or that's it?  No, they don't show  inside, do they?  I don't think so.  Well, if they do,  we'll jump back in,  but I've got to eat  my sandwich.  Yeah, I got it.  I got it.  We'll actually talk to the balcony  and that's where we  anticipate seeing them kiss  for the first time.  Oh, they do their  traditional first kiss  on the balcony.  And then he bends her  over the balcony  and they do their  first ass fucking.  In front of everybody.  Yes.  He gives her  a royal rogering.  Rogering.  They wanted to modernize it. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, so fuck the kiss.  Oh, it's great.  He pulls out of her ass  real fast  as to pink soccer.  And that's when  the wedding  is finally  consummated.  There's also  going to be a flyover  of jets.  Wow.  Several flyovers  as a matter of fact.  Well, like some football players  are going to fly.  That's stupid.  I'm sorry.  They've been invited  to the Prince of Wales  giving a private dinner  followed by dancing  at Pippa and Palace.  There's been rumours  actually about the party  that Ellie Goulding  might be performing,  I think.  She might be performing there. 
[01:19:30]  Giant disco balls  are in there right now.  Oh.  Disco balls?  I want giant disco balls  and so they went,  yes, okay.  Am I the only one,  by the way,  that thinks Prince Harry  and Pippa Middleton?  Maybe.  Maybe romantically  develop those people.  A little more incest.  Yeah, that wouldn't hurt.  Yeah, what happened?  Yeah, sure.  He's like thinking  Prince Harry  and Pippa Middleton  and see if they  can say anything.  Prince Harry  and fucking  anybody else in the family. 
[01:20:00]  Stupid queen.  Look at that thing.  Look at her.  That is a piss yellow  fucking outfit she's got on.  What do you think  her feet look like?  Just big calloused messes.  Fucking corns.  She's got to take a shit  so bad.  No kidding.  She's got to wipe  the royal ass.  You know she doesn't  wipe her own ass.  No.  Prince Charles  doesn't even squeeze  his toothpaste out  that somebody does that  for him.  Really?  That'd be nice.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't know.  That's a dumb hat. 
[01:20:30]  Prince Charles  what the fuck?  What is it?  My turn.  I don't know what it is.  A guy with a top hat.  A dinka dinka doo.  Everybody wants to get  into the act.  They certainly felt  that they've gotten  what they've been  waiting for so far.  A dinka dink.  A dinka doo.  We'll see it out  right there, man.  Yes, as the buses  of peasants  make their way in.  Yeah, the queen's  back at her dumb palace.  Wow, what a day.  Yeah, we can go home now. 
[01:21:00]  We did our job.  We did our coverage.  Our royal wedding coverage.  Now let's just loop that  for the whole weekend.  Oh, please.  Do you know how mad  they would be  if we just kept  replaying that?  Oh, good.  They deserve it.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I gotta eat.  I took cold medicine  on an empty stomach.  Oh, God.  It's great.  I feel like I'm tripping.  Nice.  This is wonderful.  I'm seeing trails.  It's like when I took  mescaline at the  Van Halen show. 
[01:21:30]  Look at the stupid  fucking...  What is that?  Lady Gaga hat.  That's crazy.  Who is that bitch?  I don't know.  She's the wild one, though.  Yeah, these are the  party girls.  She's gonna be  dancing.  It's probably the  hookers they hired.  Yeah.  Make this a real party  for everyone.  And Elton's gonna sing  Candle Up My Ass  after I change the words  again.  All right, guys.  We'll break into  some other shit.  Stay there.  The OB and Anthony Show. 
[01:22:00]  The OB and Anthony Show.  Damn it.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  Virus.  Call the OB and Anthony Show  now.  866-WOW-1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  Send your feedback to  feedback at  opiananthony.com.  The OB and Anthony Show.  The OB and Anthony Show. 
[01:22:30]  I remember that.  It was more fun to do that  than I imagined it would be.  If you would have said  that would be fun,  I would have fucking said  no, it won't.  Who is this?  Who is this?  I loved them for two minutes.  Fuck, I forgot their name.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:23:00]  Wolf Mother, of course.  All right, we're going to start  the radio show.  A little late today.  Sorry about that.  Well, we did, you know,  our fantastic coverage  of the Royal Wedding.  I liked it.  It was off the cuff.  I think it was off the hook.  Yeah.  Yo. 
[01:23:30]  So glad the guys  that run the channel  were smart enough.  Yeah.  Because they know this,  like the back of their hand,  Anthony.  And you know this.  They finally had the skill set  to go, you know,  Opie and Anthony  and Jim Norton  are going to be on live  the same time  a world event is happening.  And boy, I know  Opie, Anthony, and Jim  would certainly want to, like,  goof on the whole fucking thing.  So I'm going to come in early  because I run the channel.  And I'm going to cut down  some of these delays  so it almost syncs up 
[01:24:00]  for everybody.  That would be good.  So thank you for that.  Thank you for having the,  what is it, foresight?  Yes.  The vision?  Either one.  Foresight.  Foresight and vision  both work?  Oh, that's right.  None of that happened  because they don't have  the skill set.  They just thought,  Opie and Anthony,  they'll probably just do  a regular show today.  So why should I come in  and see if I could cut down  some of the delays  so their coverage isn't  10 to 12 minutes  behind everybody else?  Or jump off or something.  Yeah, but that takes  vision.  At least something.  That takes vision. 
[01:24:30]  15 seconds out of  fucking two minutes.  15 would have helped us.  By the way,  when does our channel  switch to another number?  Who gives a shit?  Who the hell does that go down?  That's happening soon.  Although people are taking  that very seriously.  It's better for us  because it's on both platforms  the same.  Everyone knows it.  No, it's not on the same  on both platforms.  We're not going to be  the same number?  No.  Why would we?  No.  Well, why don't they just do that?  Because it makes  too much sense.  Because there's a thing  that happens with that.  There's a lot of technology  involved. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, there's a thing.  Seriously.  Yeah, there's a thing.  Because some Sirius radios  can't go past  certain channel numbers.  Right, so 202 is going down.  No.  On XM it is.  What's it going to be on Sirius?  I don't...  Wait a minute.  Are they syncing up  other channels?  Here we go.  This day has potential  to be explosive.  I just want to...  And it's not going to come from me  because people are on their eyes.  Oh, it's going to have...  It's not coming from me, man. 
[01:25:30]  I'm telling you.  But this day has potential  to be fucking lethal.  My thing is,  I thought that they were changing.  Like, they're going to sync  the boneyard up.  It's going to be the same on both.  I know that.  Because they said we have to do...  I think, right?  How do we know which ones  are going to be the same on both?  The really important  satellite radio people  will have the same channel number.  Right.  We don't.  No.  Why would we?  Why don't we?  We don't even have interns.  Well, I don't know.  They'll give you an explanation  that sounds logical, I guess.  Because we are 
[01:26:00]  the bastard children.  But it still fucks us up  in the end.  We are the last holdouts.  But they'll have some  logical answer for you.  Well, logical, sure.  But, I mean...  Let's just move it this way.  They could have figured it out.  It's not that hard.  It's your company.  You could have figured  something out.  It's not hard.  What are we going to be?  105 on XM?  Something like that.  Which is kind of cool.  And then we're going to be  20-something on XM.  Why wouldn't you make us  105 on both?  And then we're going to be  206.  So why even move that one?  It's so fucking stupid, dude.  It's so... 
[01:26:30]  Wait, so we're going  further away on Sirius?  The 200s for Sirius  is all the best of XM  that packages  that Sirius people come by.  Right.  So, like...  Look, Howard, obviously...  Fine.  He's got 100 on both  and 101 on both.  That's smart.  Yeah, so why can't we be on both  if he could be on both?  That's smart.  Because from what I understand,  we're still on the pay service  for the Sirius side,  and it can't handle it  in the 100s.  It has to be up  in the higher channels.  But he's on the pay service  for the XM side.  Yeah.  So why does it work that way 
[01:27:00]  but it doesn't work our way?  Meaning the XM technology  can do that  but the Sirius technology can't.  Well, why don't they figure out  a way to put us on...  It doesn't have to be 105.  I don't care if it's 888  with Dash 4.  Can you imagine if Fios said  we have to leave HBO  because we just can't figure out  how to move the fucker?  Can you imagine that?  Can you imagine that?  I'll say this much.  I had a...  Someone told me a logical answer  and I said, whatever.  Do whatever.  I don't care.  It's just...  I'm working on my podcast.  Fucking dumb.  I don't give a fuck.  But my... 
[01:27:30]  This is the only thing I'll say.  It's been two years.  And you knew for two years  that you were going to eventually  try to do this.  And you couldn't figure it out  in two years?  No.  So then you get the logical answer  why you can't do it.  But for two years  they should have figured out  how to do it.  And if we're going to be  on 206 on Sirius  why aren't we just on 202 on both?  206 on Sirius?  It's been on XM.  Yeah.  I don't fucking get it.  Well, you're not smart enough  to get it. 
[01:28:00]  Sink it up.  You're not supposed to  think about these things.  I don't believe  that there's not some way  we're zapping ourselves  into space.  Into space!  Can I tell you something too?  I think  I gotta figure this out now.  Yeah.  I got Sirius in my car.  About what?  We're part of this whole thing  obviously.  Yeah.  You know that  I still have a tough time  figuring out where we are  when I go in my car?  Like I have to think about it 
[01:28:30]  and go  oh that's right  I'm not on  because to me  Opie and Anthony  202.  Right?  Yeah.  197 on Sirius.  And to this day  I'm like  I have a half a thought  like  oh yeah  we're somewhere else.  And then I go  oh yeah  197.  Yeah.  So if I'm thinking that  and we're pretty close  to the situation  it's not good for business.  I know.  I have XM in the Escalade  and I have Sirius in the Mustang.  I figured it out obviously  but we're talking about people  that you're hoping  that's sort of like the show  they're not going to start  searching around  and figure out where it is 
[01:29:00]  on the other one.  It's very difficult to remember.  Right.  If you want something else  that makes sense  with this new channel stuff  the pop channel here  which is Sirius XM  it's on channel one  so it's Sirius Hits 1  it's now channel 2  on both platforms  but it's still called  Hits 1.  Hits 1.  Why don't they just call  Hits 2 now?  Where's 20 on 20?  Is that going to still be on 20?  47 and 63.  No 20 on 20.  20 on 20 is 3.  Yeah it's number 3  on both platforms.  Yeah it is.  Yes it is.  And it's still called  20 on 20. 
[01:29:30]  Why?  It's not on 20.  Wait a minute.  What do we got?  So it's fucking  is 10-10 wins  on 4-11?  Wait wait.  It's mind boggling.  The whole name of  20 on 20  is based on the fact  that it's on channel 20.  So it's still 20 on 20  but it's on channel what?  On channel 3.  Cool.  Good luck to you guys.  But it's the old Sirius 805  but it's the old XM 20  but now it's the new channel 3  so it's very easy.  So are they going to change  the name of 20 on 20  so they don't confuse  the fuck out of everybody?  20 on 3. 
[01:30:00]  What does 20 on 20 mean  if it's not on 20 anymore?  Dude of course.  What are they going to  fucking play  old Hugh Downs audio?  It's just 2020.  I got it.  It's just like  oh Hugh Downs joke.  Here's a legend  with that 2020.  What?  He was good.  I do get confused though  when I have to go back  and forth from the XM  and the Sirius so  Yeah.  You know  and they had a long time  to figure out  where to put  you know  we're a high profile show  we should have been on both.  You know  I heard their answer  and to them 
[01:30:30]  it seems logical  I don't think  it's logical at all.  They don't think  we're a high profile show  It's fine man  We got our interns back  and guys are getting raises  They're invisible  Of course we're a high profile show  So the raises  Maybe we're not  Maybe it's just an illusion  we have  just depressing me  Just ride it out  There's other stuff  It's all about status quo  We come in every day  We deliver a program  So why would they  do anything  to  you know 
[01:31:00]  make us happy  or give a little extra money  to the crew  or things like that  when we still come in  every day  We do our part  We adhere to the contract  For now  I'm working up things  Adhering to the contract  I guess  Yeah  So when does that  channel change thing happen?  I don't even know when  I think next Wednesday  May 4  So  New Sirius XM channel 
[01:31:30]  numbers starting  May the 4th  So why  I guess lots of people  May  If they couldn't  figure it out  See I don't even know  which is which now  Wait a minute  So they couldn't move  Hold on  I swear to god  I can't even figure it out  and we're  This is our show  So we're gonna be  XM 105 right?  So we were XM 202  So  But Sirius we're gonna be 206  206  So why couldn't they just  keep us at 206 on both?  Does XM go up to 206? 
[01:32:00]  I don't know  I don't give a fuck  where we are  as long as we're on  the same thing on both  platforms  Why are we moving 202?  Because I guess it's a better  dial position  Better dial position  For how?  And when you have  hundreds of channels  I don't really see  moving down  Because they group  all of their  programming together  So it's like  all the decades channels  are in one spot  and then all the comedy channels  are in one spot  and all the sports channels  are in one spot  And what are we  the fucking  the people that they  don't like  but can't quite  get rid of spots  Quite  Here's what I  Here's my worry  Fuck the numbers 
[01:32:30]  Fuck whatever it is  Fuck people trying to  remember where  Here's the problem  Bandwidth  Guaranteed  the channel is going  to sound like  dog shit  because they're going  to try to jack us  for bandwidth  or something will  sound fucked up  when they make the switch  like people will be like  dude you sound like  shit or something  because no  logistically  nothing ever fucking  works when they try  to change things  or introduce  something new  I've heard  for a while 
[01:33:00]  that the app  our audio sounds  not as good as others  I heard the fucking  internet feed  fucks up  every day  every day  every day  I gave up  telling those guys  I know  it's better just  to come in here  and laugh  and then go home  and make a dumb  video of a homeless  guy shitting  that's my life  I don't give a fuck  I just got a tweet  good luck to you guys  some Sirius radios  do not even get  197 or 200  that's true  now tried to order  best of XM  but was told  not available  so I wonder  if that's why  they're moving us  down on the Sirius  because all Sirius  radios get 105 
[01:33:30]  so maybe they're doing  that on  but we're not 105  on Sirius  now 105 on Sirius  we're 206  on Sirius  so they moved this  to another channel  that these older  radios couldn't get  what  what  why  wait  what are we going to be  105 on  XM  so  wait  there are radios  that can't get  206  on  on the Sirius side  the older technology  can't get  couldn't even get  197 with the best of  so now  so now we're moved  further down to 206  so again 
[01:34:00]  they're not going to  be able to get us  if they have an older  radio right  that seems to be the  case  great  so the technology  won't allow them  that's perfect  hey are any of these  guys here  I want to talk to  I won't be a dick  I want to talk to you  are they here even  I don't know  we'll go find out  yeah go find out  I would like an  explanation on the air  absolutely on the air  stop hiding from  being on the air  yeah  this is a legit  explanation I would like  I just want to know  no meeting after  the show  oh hell no  I don't do meetings  I can't  I have an interview  and a fucking phoner  to BJ Shea 
[01:34:30]  I have a fucking  monstrous cold right now  wait aren't we doing  a simulcast with BJ  I don't think we can  why what happened  with that  I don't know  I honestly don't know  by the way my throat's  getting sore  after the  I can't fuck  every time I'm on a  plane I get sick  yeah  you haven't been on a  plane in a while  I was  when  I fucking  yesterday  zipped on back  what you go fly  back and forth to  Cleveland  because you were  bored  yes  you haven't been on  a plane in a  few days now  I was on the red  yesterday morning  I landed  oh my god 
[01:35:00]  I'm losing my mind  I thought you were  here all week  no no I was in  holy shit  I'm losing my mind  I gave a very  mediocre performance  on Chelsea lately  my fault  not the audience's  they were fine  no it wasn't  particularly good  oh Jimmy  stop beating  yourself up  no it's accurate  and then  Leno went well  my brother was  flying back from  I guess he had a gig  in Florida  Florida yeah  I saw him tweet that  yeah he was  coming back  and he had to  fly back in that  storm yesterday  yeah  he uh  two aborted  landings 
[01:35:30]  and then they  had to land  to refuel  in Hartford  because they  ran out of  gas  what airline  and then  I don't know  and then he  landed at  MacArthur  out on Long  Island  wow that's  fucked up  two aborted  landings  because of  the weather  wait was he  on a small  plane  I don't think  so not from  Florida so  you get that  shit yesterday  yeah yeah  it was pitch  black like  night time  from my  apartment  really quickly  it was a  very nice  sunny day  within minutes  it was as  dark as  could be  yeah it was  like night  and then all 
[01:36:00]  of a sudden  did you get  the snow  where were you  I was up  high but  maybe it's  rain by the  time it hits  the ground  yeah yeah  no then all  of a sudden  it was like  crazy snow  that didn't  stick or do  anything  and then it  turned into  fog where you  couldn't see  the ground  all within  15 minutes  no it just  got fucking  pitch black  dark and  then rained  like a  motherfucker  had a few  lightning strikes  and thunder  that was  ridiculous  yeah there  was some  snow in  that shit  weird  yeah  or maybe  it was like  a tiny little  hail or something  I was bumming  because my  pool is finally 
[01:36:30]  up to I think  74 degrees  I'm getting it  I'm getting it  there  non-stop  running the  heater  it's amazing  but trying to  keep that thing  heated on these  48 degree nights  not that easy  no  it's like a  it's like a  video game  I watch  it's like  it ticks up a  couple of  fucking degrees  and then at  night it  goes down  and I'm  pissed  I turn the  propane on  bam  heat that  bitch  where do you  think we're  going to be  at the end  of this  contract  I have no  idea  because under 
[01:37:00]  these  circumstances  we're  certainly  not going  to be  here  if they  if they can't  get us  interns  I don't  know  what do you  think will  happen  to us  podcasts  I've had my  studio revamped  I had a guy  come downstairs  yesterday  for lighting  rigs  there's no way  I'm staying  under these  circumstances  I mean I  hope they can  figure it out  because I  kind of like  it here  but there's  no fucking  way  Sam  Sam anyone  here to  come down  and explain  shit  well I  yeah I could  deliver a message  from Gary  tell him to come 
[01:37:30]  down  tell him to get  his ass on the  fucking air  he doesn't want  to come on the  air  why  it's not his  thing  I don't give a  fuck  every boss  we've had  has come on  the air  this is a  legit  technical  question  this is a  legit question  about I  want to know  why some  radios  it's not  his fault  I mean  he's not  the tech  guy  I just  want to  ask him  why we  can't  do  that  you  want me  to tell  you  what he  said  yeah  the  hardware  it's the  technology  in the  hardware  of the  older  Sirius  radios  in order  to charge  for channels  they need 
[01:38:00]  to be  grouped  within a  certain number  which is why  we're  so why  couldn't  they  just  match  I don't  give a  fuck  we're in  the  100s  on XM  I think  it's way  more important  to be  the same  channel  on Sirius  and XM  than moving  us down  to a  better  channel  placement  well  the thinking  in putting  us in  the earlier  channel  placement  is that  this way  because  our  listeners  will find  us  wherever  we are  we have  a better  channel  that's  all that  overthinking  crap  that doesn't 
[01:38:30]  work  in the  end  well  all the  channels  are getting  grouped  together  now  so  we're  getting  grouped  so  all  the  entertainment  channels  are going  to be  in the  same  area  so  we  will  absolutely  lose  listeners  because  they  can't  figure  out  where  the  fuck  we  are  on  the  other  one  because  it  doesn't  match  up  well  I don't  think  we'll  lose  listeners  because  he says  that  it's better  to be  grouped  with  entertainment  shows  so people  flipping  around  will stumble  upon us  than it  would be  if we were  past all  the traffic  channels  give me  research  that proves  that's  better  it's  better  to  advertise  us 
[01:39:00]  if you  do a  very good  radio show  people will  find you  it's  simple  as that  this  consulting  it's  better  and that  is  bullshit  the fact  is  that  we're  on  two  different  channels  is  really  bad  way  worse  here's  my  question  yeah  is  there  uh  a radio  that's  out there  that  will  not  be  able  to  get  us  because  of  where  we  are  and  is  there  a  way  that  if  we  were  on  a  different  channel  they  would  be  able  to  get  us  I  believe  I'll  ask  him  but 
[01:39:30]  I  believe  that  the  answer  is  that  the  earlier  serious  radios  can't  get  any  premium  content  regardless  so  they  couldn't  get  us  now  they  won't  get  us  later  and  the  only  way  they  would  be  able  to  get  us  is  if  we  weren't  a  premium  channel  and  we  were  just  another  free  serious  channel  so  no matter  where  they  put  us  it  wouldn't  matter  because  the  old  technology  is  not  able  to  handle  premium  even  on the  new  technology  the  premium  channels  have to  be  higher  up  they  can't  be  in  the  lower 
[01:40:00]  tier  for  whatever  reason  so  why  can't  our  XM  number  be  on the  same  higher  up  it  doesn't  make  sense  because  they  want  to  group  us  in  with  the  entertainment  shows  so  why don't you move entertainment channels up higher  because then they'd be after all the traffic and weather and sports  and people they want people to be able to scan through the channels to find them  uh huh  what  I have no idea  doesn't matter  but I tell you there is somebody who really does push this radio show  so thanks Jay Leno for being the one person who fucking 
[01:40:30]  promotes  the Opie and Anthony show that is not myself or Oprah Ant or anyone  he does a good job  every time  Jay  he's the only one  is there any other show that is a premium channel that is on both platforms  uh you mean  are we a special  with the same channel  are we a special case or something  no I think Oprah is on two separate channels still  uh  dumb  I think  I don't know  the sports channels may or may not be but they're up in the sports tier anyway  that's play by play  and stuff 
[01:41:00]  they had two years to figure this shit out  the satellites  once they're up there I guess they can't do nothing  or whatever  satellite  I don't know  is it because Stern broadcasts  is it because XM's  technology is better  that he's able to be on a pay thing here  XM's  XM's equipment can handle  okay  paid channels on any  number  right  it doesn't matter what numbers are  Sirius's cannot  Sirius's units cannot  another great excuse by the way  how did XM fucking get their dick kicked in this battle 
[01:41:30]  they had the technology  the subscribers  and obviously fucking  just blithering idiots running it  that's what it was  it was mismanagement  oh  boy did they suck  wow  how do you lose that battle  fuck  dude  it's like  I mean  I don't know  I mean  this might not be the right time  but uh  you know  if you're in Seattle  anti-social network  ticket squads out  for July 1st  today  with myself  Brewer  today  Bill and David  here's a good example  here's a guy 
[01:42:00]  no I'm serious  Bob in Virginia  this is my concern right here  Bobby  obviously a big time  fan of the show  tell us what you got  Bob  yeah well  I'm sitting here in my truck  I've got the Sirius radio  sorry boys  won't be able to listen to you  no more when you make the switch  why  his radio doesn't have that channel  the technology won't  or the radio I got won't work  so I can run down  a local truck stop  and buy one  oh  hold on  hold on  hold on  hold on  what channel are you listening  to us on right now 
[01:42:30]  uh  196  so what is  197  what does your radio  go up to  prove my point  see  what does your radio  go up to  uh  if I go to try to make the jump  I can do that right now  well it's not on yet  I mean  we're not on 206 yet  but I believe  right  that anybody that can get  197  will be able to get  206  you're sure  I believe  go run down  and ask him  so they're just adding bandwidth  which is going to wreck  I mean adding challenge  is going to wreck the bandwidth  now because this idiot  can't even come on the air  for a real conversation 
[01:43:00]  we'll just wait  we'll wait for Sam  to run down the hall  it's like a mob thing  what a fucking pussy  get your stupid ass  on the show with us  well fuck you guys  not you  not you Bob  he's like uh  I'm sorry Bob  I wasn't talking to you  Bob's all mad now  he's ripping his radio out  and throwing it out his window  look how far Sam is  I know he's way down there  I've never seen anyone  go that far down the hall  it's like the people  that talk to Paulie  in Goodfellas  he doesn't like to 
[01:43:30]  you know  he doesn't like to talk to  why would you agree  to be part of this channel  if you don't even want  to be on the air  yeah  this is a case  where on the air  just go away  go somewhere else  this is a case  where being on the air  is actually important  of course  yeah I get it  you don't want to  you know  come in and be goofed on  on a regular basis  but when it comes to real  you know  situations  you gotta get your ass  on the fucking air  with us  situations  it is times like this  though where you miss  Eric Logan  who would come on  and at least have an explanation 
[01:44:00]  whether we liked it or not  he would just at least  know what's going on  fat bloated Eric Logan  or the new slender GQ  I wish we could have  a combination  of the old Elo  who would come on  and is not afraid  to talk on the air  but looking like he does now  so we could all have  raging hard arms  looking at him  yes  because he is  different at this point  look at the Beckhams  because this is basically  just a time waster now  does he have a medal  I don't know  I think he was knighted  or something  was he  Sam who's getting his cardio  yes Sam  who ran back  well he said 
[01:44:30]  there won't be a bandwidth issue  because they're not adding  new channels  they're just moving things  because there are  some channels are going away  some of the music channels  are going away  what's going away  I don't know for sure  well how can we find out  I mean I don't have a list  well who does  check it twice  can you run back  and ask him  what music channels  are going away  I don't think he knows  like off the top of his head  which ones  because everything's  getting combined  ok  so will there be  like let's say  the 80s channel  80s on 8  80s on 8  on both  well there'll be  one 80s on 8  yeah  and it will be  on both services 
[01:45:00]  channel 8  is 80s on 8  regardless of what  your services  regardless  yeah  regardless  so if people  he can't get 206  now will he be able  to get 206  he said he's  now he's going  to confirm 100%  but he said  in all likelihood  like 98%  if he can get  a premium channel  now  there's no reason  why he won't  be able to get  a premium channel  but there's a possibility  that that's not  going to happen  what does 98% mean  it's a very very  low  that's a fake  percent shit  a very low  possibility  what does that  mean  it's almost  I mean 
[01:45:30]  it means that  he needs to  confirm with  technology people  before he can  say 100%  but there's no  reason to think  that if he can  get a premium  channel now  I'm exhausted  he won't be able  to get one  I'm exhausted  your business model  confuses me  yeah  I don't understand  this  oh it's a bug  it's a building  it's a bug  how's that getting  Brett is South Carolina  Brett  yeah  go ahead Brett  yeah  I'm sitting  in my truck  I have an older  about a 3 year old  serious add-on 
[01:46:00]  that I can listen  to you just fine  check out the big  brain on Brett  nice  but in our  brand new  2010 Chrysler  300c  the radio won't  go past like  180  braggart  I can't even  you know  they sold us  premium channels  I can't even  listen to you  in our brand new  car  do you know  on the radio  I have in my  when I got my  BMW I got a couple  years ago  I'm just leasing it  I had to have a new  radio put in that  could get best of  XM  because it wasn't  XM capable  at all 
[01:46:30]  well Chrysler told us  that it's not even  available for the  vehicle  why don't they just  fucking take it  I don't know if that's  true because Chrysler  does Jeep too  and my Jeep is fine  I can't wait till you  fucking roll that  into a ditch  your fucking afro  gets caught  I've had a Jeep  for a long time  it's never rolled over  no  no  you have a Jeep  you drive  he has a Jeep  yes of course I drive  I live in Westchester  I thought you were  a little kid  don't you remember  that time  where he had a flat tire  and he called his dad  he called his dad  right right  that's true  I called 911  after that  made him  yeah we did a whole 
[01:47:00]  thing about it  911 for a flat  could ease  could Gary maybe  call the show  he doesn't  it's not his thing  to do the  on the air deal  then why is he  working with this  this is important  this is actually  something we need  kind of live answers  no this is important  this stuff's important  these are maps  every phone call  has a question  about this  well let's see  what I can answer  so it's pretty  alright let's get  some phone call questions  it's on everyone's mind  ok  let's see what that  this guy can't  come on the air  let me run down the hall  let's get a question 
[01:47:30]  for you to give him  yeah  one at a time  yeah that's how  we're going to do it  ok let's do it  what's the question  let's see  get a question  who won the  World Series  in  19-aught  let's say hi  to Pat  in Massachusetts  Pat  hey Pat  yesterday I actually  called their  800 number  and  explained to them  that my Mercedes  does not have  any channels  in the 200s  what do I do  and he says 
[01:48:00]  let me put you  on hold  and talk to my  manager  he goes back  and he says  there's nothing  at this time  so I said  well if I'm an  ex-emmer from  the beginning  my Mercedes  is serious  I now pay  for a second  subscription  with the bonus  now you're  telling me  I'm done  the only reason  I bought this  was 202  to 197  I got the 197  and it pretty much  capped out there  now I'm done  so as of Wednesday  I cancel my subscription  is that what you're  telling me  and he says  as of right now  there's nothing  in the works 
[01:48:30]  so you can't get us  in your one Mercedes  I can now  but as of Wednesday  when they move you  to the 200s  it's like  taking a regular  FM  and you can't  go higher  than 108  you know  that's it  my radio  only stops  it's not a dial  it's a digital  readout  will your radio  be able to go  higher once the  switch is made  you might not  be able to get  that channel now  but once the  switch is made  you may be able  to get that channel  I don't know  if the channel  exists now  so you wouldn't  be able to get it  well go ask  can you go ask  him  we should play  that fucking  girl from 
[01:49:00]  Ipanema  oh that's even  better  oh yeah  because he's got  a chariots of  fire  it kind of works  yes  la la la la la  Ipanema  Ipanema 
[01:49:30]  I have a cold.  I can't even toodly-doo.  Oh, my love.  Sucks.  Cold.  Stupid cold.  Oh, my nose.  Yeah, Sam's running back now, too. 
[01:50:00]  I see that.  Hey, Sam.  Hi, Sam.  Don't get mad at us.  No, I'm not mad at anyone.  You should be mad at him because he's such a pussy.  He can't come on the air with us.  That's infuriating.  Well, I'm sorry about that.  Oh, fuck me.  Go ahead.  It sucks.  206 doesn't exist yet.  So on Wednesday, check for 206.  Not today.  We're not on 206.  We'll check for it, or will it be there?  Will it be there for this fine guy?  It will be there.  I mean, if it's not, call back. 
[01:50:30]  What good does that do?  Why wouldn't it be?  It should be.  I mean, there's no reason why it wouldn't be there.  Okay.  But check, you know, don't.  Just because you don't have 206 today, we're not on 206 today.  I just, it's ridiculous.  It's not a channel yet.  It will be on Wednesday.  Okay.  I think I got the AIDS.  I hope not.  Good.  I just got a cold.  I feel like I got the AIDS.  You'll be all right.  Goddamn.  I'm just watching the fucking, watching the wire, and I can't stop talking like fucking, 
[01:51:00]  like a...  Omar.  ...drug dealer.  All day, all I was doing, me and my girl would just fucking bad-mouthing each other  like fucking gangbangers.  Is she watching it?  Yeah, yeah.  Well, she had seen it all before.  Okay.  It's great.  But we were just like, I'll be like, bitch, what the fuck are you doing back there, bitch?  And she's cooking.  She's like, I'm cooking something.  Get your fucking ass over here, motherfucker.  It's just fun to act like a black drug dealer.  My goal is to fuck a woman who can talk dirty like Slim Charles. 
[01:51:30]  Slim Charles.  Yo, man, come in my face, man.  That's all I want is a Slim Charles fucking rules.  John in Illinois.  John?  Hi, John.  John?  Hey, I got the...  I'm a John in New York.  Sorry, go ahead.  Go, sir, yes.  Go, you're on.  I got the smartphone app. 
[01:52:00]  And, like, you guys, I can hear you fine.  Like, say I'm mowing the yard or whatever and listening to the show.  What else might you be doing?  And, like, you can't hardly hear Stern's show.  Can't hardly?  And the XM fades in and out all the time where the Sirius never did that.  We're talking about a signal issue.  That's different.  Well, I've heard that our app isn't that great.  The people that listen on our app.  The thing about the app...  It's a crap, I call it. 
[01:52:30]  I call it an app because I live in it, like, you know, I live in an apartment and stuff.  The thing about the app is that the sound quality diminishes when you lose service.  So, like, if you have full service, it's going to sound great.  If you have one or two bars, it's not going to sound as great.  How do you know all this?  Because I listen to the app.  Oh.  Oh.  I use the product.  Oh, you do.  Yes, I do.  Oh.  It's good service.  Oh. 
[01:53:00]  It is.  All right, well, we'll see what happens when they move it.  Do you know what the boneyard is going to be?  Is that going to be the same on both?  I'll look it up.  Will you please look it up?  It's going to be channel 1006.  That's perfect.  On Sirius.  1006.  Channel 3.  1006.  The boneyard is 38.  Oh, good.  No matter where you are.  Well, I'll double check.  So I don't, you know, put my foot in my mouth, but I don't see any reason.  Yes.  You should put your foot in your mouth with a shotgun attached to it. 
[01:53:30]  Oh, come on.  Boo.  It's not a bad idea, Sam.  Why do you say that?  Oh.  Dr. Steve, he's hilarious.  What do you say?  Was Weird Medicine going to be on the poster?  Weird Medicine, what channel?  I'm thinking that we should get our own commercial.  The technology is not quite what it's supposed to be yet.  Um, I drive a, uh, a Mercedes, and, uh, we, uh, can't quite get all of the, uh, the channel, 
[01:54:00]  but they're sitting there to work on them.  So I don't know.  There's been a little, had some liquid leak through the, the roof and the seepage.  Seepage through the roof?  Yeah, damaged the, uh, radio.  Fluid?  Got in there?  Fluid.  A little viscous fluid.  Fluid.  Boneyard's channel 38 on both services between Octane and Hair Nation.  Nice.  Wow, nice.  That's a great placement right there.  One more question.  Last time I talked to anyone of, um, of, uh, of, uh, I don't even know. 
[01:54:30]  I guess of, um, uh.  Importance?  I, I can't use that word.  That's, that's the problem here.  Of, uh.  Any relevance whatsoever?  Okay.  Good, good, good.  Ouch.  And this has got to be a little, it was before you went on vacation.  Wow.  And you went back a couple weeks ago.  That was like years ago.  So I would say at least a month and a half ago, I heard that they were making headway  on interns coming back to the Opie and Anthony show.  Is that a question you like answered?  Yes.  You got it. 
[01:55:00]  Headway.  There he goes.  Sam down the hallway.  Don't we have his DNA thing somewhere?  We asked that yesterday, remember?  Yeah, yeah.  What was the answer to that?  I don't remember.  I don't either.  I think we have to try to see if he's got any black blood in him.  I know he asked that question yesterday.  Yeah.  And I think we did get an answer.  He does come to work every day early, so it'll lead me to believe one way, but I didn't say  which way.  That was coming on my faces. 
[01:55:30]  Yes, you do.  Yes.  The white sheet.  Of course.  The white sheet.  He's extremely light-skinned, so that means he only misses like four days of work.  Four days.  Four days.  He makes it in.  Yeah.  Four days a year.  Here he comes back.  Oh, could you just picture this in slow motion?  I want him to try to hurl that thing.  You think he can hurl that?  Yeah.  I would like to see him jump out like a hurl.  If you wanted to see it in slow motion, we should have E-Rock run it. 
[01:56:00]  Dude, E-Rock is the heavy E-Rock.  Oh, E-Rock.  You trudge.  E-Rock does trudge.  He has very, very heavy feet, even when he's walking.  He used to be the heavy walking.  Don't make fun of E-Rock, man.  He came in at 5.52.  I'm not.  I love E-Rock.  Oh, cool.  Right before 6.  Atta boy.  Thank you.  Early day.  7-0.  At least they're here before the show starts.  Yeah.  That's nice.  Early bird gets the pizza.  5.52 today for E-Rock.  Thank you, E-Rock.  The early pterodactyl.  Thanks for the extra. 
[01:56:30]  Early whale gets the worm.  Was E-Rock early or late today?  Right on time.  That's his time?  5.52?  Yeah.  Keep it up.  What time should he be here?  Should?  Yeah.  I mean, what time do I get here?  Yeah, what time do you get in?  I don't know.  4.55?  Wow.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  It's almost an hour before E-Rock.  Yeah.  Sometimes 4.50.  Sometimes it's over an hour before E-Rock.  E-Rock comes an hour after you?  Literally.  Why?  Literally.  Because he doesn't have as much to do as me.  Membership has its privileges.  He's like a senior.  I'm like sort of bottom of the torrent pole guy. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah.  Gotta go, you know, get the shit done.  Whipping boy.  Right.  And E-Rock's like, the man is here.  The man has come to town.  Pretty cool, huh?  Exactly.  He took his boat out last night.  Did you really?  No.  No.  Why 5.52, E-Rock?  That's a fair question.  Yeah, why so early?  Yeah, exactly.  Well, Troy says that he always comes in at 5.52 either with his hand on his head or his  stomach acting like there's something wrong.  That's what Troy told me.  I'm not there when you come in. 
[01:57:30]  One is empty and one is really full.  Holy shit.  I don't know if it's a fact or not.  It's just what Troy told me.  Comment.  E-Rock, comment.  No comment.  No comment.  Oh, come on.  How about a fucking comment?  Stick up for yourself.  Come on, E-Rock.  What are you doing?  Fucking Charlie Sheen with that?  How about you explain why coming in at 5.52 is logical?  How about that?  Seriously.  Come on.  We're ex-Emily.  No, what's your answer? 
[01:58:00]  I don't have a logical answer for that.  Well, the answer is you know that you can walk all over the guys in charge.  So, you know what?  I would do the same thing if I was you guys.  What the fuck?  Yeah, exactly right.  How come this issue has never been raised before?  Good point.  If I knew I could walk over the guy, I mean, we're in our own little space now, but if I  was one of these guys and I knew I could walk all over the bosses, of course I'd show  up at 5.52.  Of course.  Absolutely.  I don't even blame E-Rock on this one.  He's a BMS.  We all would do that.  We don't give a shit.  If we knew we had a lame-ass fucking...  Bad motherfucker. 
[01:58:30]  All right.  If we all knew we had a lame-ass boss looking over us, of course you would show up at 5.52.  Who wouldn't?  But he does a good job when he's here.  That's my man.  Did he get your answer to that other question?  Yes.  What was the question?  It was whether or not the...  Obie said the interns...  They were making headway with the interns last week.  Yes.  And he would like an update.  Sure.  Fair enough.  The entire managerial staff of this channel is working hard on that very issue as we speak.  Okay.  What?  And they were last time we addressed the issue, which was months ago. 
[01:59:00]  Rome didn't get built in a day.  Another whole...  Another semester went by.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  By the way, if anyone's been punished, get us our fucking interns back.  The interns we would have had...  Jesus Christ.  ...would be working now.  Yeah.  In real jobs.  They'd be out of school.  Or they'd be applying for...  They probably would get accepted now.  You're like, I want to make it perfectly clear.  I'm not mad at you.  I want to make this perfectly clear.  I'm not.  If you get away with it, I would absolutely do the same thing in your position.  By the way, if you want a lousy taste in your mouth, have a cold ease. 
[01:59:30]  And then five minutes later, have a medium iced latte with fat-free milk.  Really?  Wow.  Is that not a good coffee?  It doesn't smell bad.  It just...  You know that taste you get after you suck a cough drop?  What?  Yeah.  Oh, it's awful.  Awful.  It's like brushing your teeth after coughing.  Yeah.  Brush your teeth and then eat like an apple.  No.  Or an orange juice.  Everyone knows orange juice.  Why don't we go apple?  Right.  That's good.  Everyone knows orange juice.  I was trying. 
[02:00:00]  I failed.  I'm sick.  I can't think.  My head...  I have a sinus thing.  Sometimes when I talk, I get a buzzing in my head from the sinuses.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  I hate having a cold.  These motherfuckers still didn't show up for their kiss on the balcony?  They're getting on the balcony and they're going to fucking make out.  They're on E-Rock time.  Exactly.  Oh, shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  What, E-Rock?  What'd you say?  He said something.  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  What'd you say?  I was going to say, shut the fuck up, Sam. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, fuck.  Shut the fuck up, Sam.  Someone likes being off terrestrial radio.  It's a wild man.  God, it's an exile channel.  I know.  Wild.  Someone's using that language restriction.  Yeah, that a boy.  E-Rock don't give a fuck, though.  That's the thing about E-Rock.  E-Rock, drop the N-Bomb if the DNA comes back.  If that DNA comes back, you are just, whenever these mics are off, I am dropping the N-Bomb  on just every day.  He does drop the N-Bomb when they say, are you going to be here early?  No. 
[02:01:00]  E-Rock.  Five.  Nachos.  I need another question answered.  Not by Sam, by E-Rock.  You got it.  Five fifty-two because no raise in many, many years?  Okay.  Mm-hmm.  That's what happens.  Five years, yeah.  Put it in the yes column.  Five years, no raise, so five fifty-two.  That makes sense.  Wow.  Hasn't really been no raises in five years, man?  Yep.  Five years without a raise.  Nothing from CBS, nothing from XM.  And we certainly haven't had a raise.  And we certainly haven't had a raise, trust me.  If it wasn't for the Christmas bonuses we get, I would really be pissed. 
[02:01:30]  God damn, is Amy Schumer looking fucking hot?  We don't get Christmas.  God damn.  God damn, do you look hot?  Yeah, look at Amy's legs.  Amy shows that she's sexy, too.  Fuck you.  She shows it off.  She doesn't, uh, Dr. Smith.  You can see where her pussy goes.  Oh, thank you, Dr. Smith.  Of course.  He wants to help me cure my cold.  Does he really?  Yeah.  What's his awful idea?  It's an elixir that I made.  It's for Amy.  Yeah.  She takes some aspirin and, uh...  Why don't you get some of that spring water in?  Her number goes up because she's a comic. 
[02:02:00]  Like, that brings her...  What's wrong with you?  ...hotness number up.  She's hot no matter what she's doing for a living.  No, I understand.  Believe me, I understand that.  I understand.  But something about her being, like, funny chick brings her numbers up.  If she was worried for Perkins, she'd be a solid 10, right?  Fuck, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Exactly.  If she's your Perkins waitress...  Solid 10.  She's a solid fucking 10.  What makes her, like, a 3?  A 3?  Um...  Fuck.  If she...  If she ever slept with a black man...  Oh, no. 
[02:02:30]  Right on there.  There's my racism coming out again.  Oh, boy.  Oh, Anthony.  But it's all fake for the radio, right?  It's just fake.  I play a racist on the radio.  Here's what makes her a 3.  She was a spokesmodel for panties that hide bad yeast infections.  Ah.  Let's see how...  Oh, he's going to kiss that little girl.  Let's see how the...  Could you see him just whip around and start making out with that six-year-old?  Yes, I can.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  We're on the balcony.  My name's Carly.  I want to see how this Princess William kisses.  Oh, that's a lame-ass kiss.  That's it?  That's all she gets?  That's it? 
[02:03:00]  That's what a buck-toothed idiot he is.  Oh, God.  She's bleeding from the mouth with his buck teeth.  She's sick of an apple in his mouth.  Speaking of buck teeth, when is Amy coming in?  Does this guy even like...  Oh, she got cute little bunny teeth.  Can I ask something?  Does this guy even like girls, you think?  Yeah.  You see how he kissed her?  I know.  He's like, yeah, I'll get the pussy later.  It was the worst fucking kiss ever.  I'll be right back.  He's keeping the British end up is what he's doing, man.  You think he has bad breath?  He keeps licking his teeth.  Yeah, he's trying. 
[02:03:30]  His mouth is all dry because he's nervous.  He's waving.  It seems like only yesterday, Opie, we were watching them as children.  And now he's a grown man.  I hear they're going to...  Married.  I hear they're going to...  They're tossing off the first child on the balcony.  They beat me to it.  It's tradition.  I thought they were going to push the queen over the top.  That would be great.  It was boot her in the ass.  Oh, they're chanting, show your tits.  Show your tits.  Oh, really?  They got WOW stickers out. 
[02:04:00]  It's nice.  It's crazy.  No!  Show your tits.  Show your tits.  Yeah, I heard it.  You hear that?  Yeah.  The kiss wasn't enough for this broad.  You think they're going to dance to it?  It's Friday, Friday.  Why would you get married on a Friday?  Partying, partying.  Yeah.  Partying, partying.  Yeah.  Fun, fun, fun.  Yeah.  Who needs to be here earlier?  Nah.  He got it.  He got this shit on lock.  Yeah.  We...  Friday, Friday.  He's giving me dirty looks. 
[02:04:30]  Friday.  Yeah.  The weekend.  Partying, partying, partying.  Yeah.  Partying, partying.  Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.  Eric's taking out his anger on me.  He's super pissed at me right now.  He's super pissed.  He's giving me dirty looks.  Is he?  I'm hungry.  Don't, don't.  He's being self-deprecating to move this stuff.  He's giving me very dirty looks.  Yeah, why are you giving Sam dirty looks?  Because he looks good. 
[02:05:00]  I'm hungry.  Ah.  He's bullshitting.  That was dumb.  Ah, shit.  That was just a stupid comment.  Damn.  See, that's way more harsh.  That's, like, very literal and harsh.  I'm not like that.  Yeah, but I don't blame him for coming in at 552.  Because he don't give a fuck.  I really don't.  He don't give a fuck.  I want people to understand.  I don't, I really don't blame him.  You would too, right?  Absolutely.  Damn, the big flyover.  Cool.  See, we have to be here no matter what.  You gotta do a show.  We have to do the show.  Those are some cool fucking planes. 
[02:05:30]  Nice, right?  Some old, old school planes, yo.  That's nice.  A British Hurricane.  How do you know that?  And a Spitfire.  Oh, that's good.  A Lancaster.  That's fucking nice.  You gotta drop Agent Orange on the pals.  Oh, that's fucking cool as shit.  They're very proud of their fucking WW2 fucking victory.  Those English.  We withstood so much.  Yes.  Yes.  Wah, wah, wah.  Yes. 
[02:06:00]  Wow, what tradition.  All right, let's go to break in.  Amy Schumer's here with her hotness.  Yes, Amy, what is she wearing?  Her funny body.  She's wearing some kind of a dress thingy, but it's...  She's got a new CD out now.  We're really showing her legs in her fucking cleavage.  Hi, Amy.  Hi.  We got a track we can play from her CD to pump it up?  Actually, yeah.  There's the CD right there.  Yeah, but there's no track listings.  Oh, fuck.  Well, I don't know.  Play track four.  That's a good one.  This is a...  Play track four. 
[02:06:30]  I don't give a shit.  All right, that's fine.  Yeah, I don't give a fuck.  I'm in the E-Rock school, baby.  Play track 555.  I don't blame you.  Get it?  That's what time he shows up?  552.  Oh, or 552.  On an early day.  Yeah.  That was his early day.  He's clocking in for overtime.  Ask Amy what track to play.  All right.  Mmm.  Masturbating.  We don't know what track that is.  No, he says what he's been doing out there.  She said three or four.  You don't even know what track your masturbating clip's on. 
[02:07:00]  No.  Amy, you're looking all hot and shit.  Thank you.  You clean up nice.  What is that getup you're wearing?  That's pretty cool.  You can picture you naked when you wear that.  Yeah.  Like, I could absolutely undress you with my eyes, as they say.  How's it looking?  Some clothes.  It looks good.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  That's good.  With the boots and shit.  Pilates.  Oh, by the way.  Pilates.  Oh, Pilates.  It's track two, Amy.  So you were completely wrong.  Track three is Cockblock, and track four is Swedes.  All right. 
[02:07:30]  We're going to do this from Amy Schumer's CD.  What is it called, Amy?  The track or the CD?  CD.  Cutting.  Cutting.  Nice.  Cutting.  That's smart.  Amy Schumer to break, and then Amy Schumer live on the show next.  And Kevin Pollack at 9.30 stopping by to say hi.  Right.  And, uh, yeah.  Don't feel bad for him.  He's a total piece of shit.  He is.  I just walked in on him masturbating.  He's like, are you mad?  I'm like, uh, no, but you seem to be.  Holy shit.  Holy shit. 
[02:08:00]  I'm like, does it owe you money?  What's going on?  He never chokes me like that.  That's all I'm saying.  Man.  A lot of hot couples here tonight.  You guys, how long?  No, how long? 
[02:08:30]  Good for you, sir.  Big dick.  Great.  Those are sexy.  You're hot.  When did you get out?  What's your name?  Don Diego.  What?  Don Diego?  That's a lot of names.  Your mom got greedy.  That's a mouthful.  That's sexy, though.  Where are you from?  Denver?  Okay.  Okay.  See, Don Diego, and I feel ridiculous saying that, that's why... 
[02:09:00]  It's a hot name, but Denver.  Like, that's why they need Google in the delivery room, right?  So when your mom was like, I'm going to name him Don Diego, Google would show up and say,  Did you mean Steve?  Did you mean Steve?  Sure, though. 
[02:09:30]  He's hot, though.  He is.  Don Diego.  I wouldn't even report you if you day-raged me.  I really wouldn't.  Look at him.  He's that hot, right?  Well, I would, but just to see you at the lineup.  I'd be like, Don Diego!  Hey!  Can you see me?  Is that how you guys met, or...?  It's only rape if you remember it.  So, um...  I'm a teacher. 
[02:10:00]  I teach things.  I feel like, in general, women, we're better at making plans, right?  Fair to say that.  Unless it's for a threesome, right?  Then men become fucking event planners.  Why are you holding a clipboard and wearing a headset?  What's...  Like, is that the Braveheart soundtrack, right?  I don't know.  Half of his face is painted. 
[02:10:30]  I mean, this is...  This is scary.  Oh, God.  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. Live.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.'s.  Fuck you!  I'd like to give a big fuck you out to my former friends.  My husband and I were really good friends with you for a long time.  You dated one of my good friends.  And then you guys broke up.  And then you went all fucking psycho crazy fat shit on her.  Fuck you.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to send this F.U. out to my fucking ex-wife. 
[02:11:00]  Not paying a fucking mortgage for seven months.  I hope you fucking rotten hell.  Fuck you!  Fuck you!  Yeah, this fuck you goes out to my fucking neighbor.  Thanks for letting your kids tear my bench down, you ex-wife.  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes to my twin brother.  Thank you so much for killing your mother and then robbing her blind and taking everything  she has.  I hope it really means a lot to you.  F.U., you prick.  Fuck you!  Good morning, fuckers.  Just want to give a big good morning fuck you to my ex-girlfriend, Ashley, who I haven't 
[02:11:30]  spoken to in six months, and then she calls to come over and fuck her, and then blocks  my number the next day.  So fuck you, Ashley.  Fuck you!  Hey, fuck you, smokers.  If it's science says do not smoke, do not fucking smoke.  I don't want your cancerous fucking hair in my face, okay?  Just die of fucking AIDS and stop smoking where you're not supposed to. 
[02:12:00]  Go fuck yourself.  Fuck you!  This fuck you goes out to my girlfriend's husband.  You stupid dumb fuck.  You should just divorce her half because she's just using you for all your fucking money.  You fucking retard.  Fuck you!  You're a fucking idiot.  Fuck you!  This F.U. goes out to Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve, fuck you.  You've got me checking my nuts for things that I never thought were wrong with it. 
[02:12:30]  You know what, Dr. Steve?  Fuck you.  Dying of fire.  Fuck you!  Call the O.B. and Anthony F.U. line.  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  The virus.  Sirius XM.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  This is the O.B. and Anthony Show.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[02:13:00]  I would have done that too.  I probably would have done that too.  What happened?  We have a fucking situation here.  Daniel's got to fight over South Park episode.  Yeah.  Don't wreck it.  Like it's the fucking season finale of Lost.  It's a cartoon.  Danny, please.  Tell people what happened.  That's a fucking big deal here.  I don't want my South Park ruined for me when I'm in public places.  Danny was online.  If I didn't see a South Park episode and you feel like you need to just yap about it with  your idiot friends getting breakfast, I don't want to know. 
[02:13:30]  I didn't see it yet.  It's on my DVR.  Wait, but you let me watch it first.  So he called out.  You actually told the guys to stop talking about the South Park?  Yeah, he said because he was about to get into it.  I'm like, look, I didn't see it.  I'm just like talking about something else.  I didn't see it.  Did you ask him nicely?  Yes, absolutely.  I just said when the guy was like, oh, I didn't see it.  He's like, did you see South Park?  Was he?  Oh, no, I missed it.  Did you see it?  And I just kind of went, I didn't.  Just kind of like, hey, if you guys are going to get into this, I didn't see it yet.  So can you just shut the fuck up?  Were they like, hey, motherfucker?  No, they just look like, oh, fuck this asshole. 
[02:14:00]  And went into great detail about what happened on South Park anyway.  Yeah, I probably would have done that too, though, to tell you the truth.  You're like, fuck you, man.  Here's what happened.  So is it a good one?  I don't know.  I wasn't paying attention.  Regardless.  It doesn't matter.  I don't know.  It's just like, la, la, la, la.  I don't know.  Just shut up.  It's brand new.  Tons of people didn't see shit.  It's like when Lost was the biggest thing in the world.  There was no Lost talk on Thursday morning on this program because, you know what?  People didn't see it.  You didn't want to fuck it up.  It's just one of those things.  Lost was a bust. 
[02:14:30]  Amy Schumer.  Amy Schumer.  Hi, Amy.  Hi.  With a low-cut number.  What?  It's so loosey-goosey, that thing you're wearing.  It's one of those things like in movies, you can just move the shoulders off and it'll  slinkly slip off your body.  It's so romantic.  It's fucking fantastic.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's like the bodyguard.  Yeah, just like it.  Yeah.  Or my bodyguard.  It's really hot when fucking Adam Baldwin fucked Ruth Gordon on the roof.  I missed that part.  Was that in the DVD?  Yeah.  When Martin Mull was videotaping it. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, that's good.  And her legs looking unbelievable, by the way.  Oh, thank you.  I love how uncomfortable Jimmy gets.  Are you exercising or something?  I'm not comfortable.  I just, I can't look at anybody.  Jimmy does get a little, yeah.  He does.  I don't look at it like that.  He acts like he's taking a test, like he's feeling at a scan trial.  Why would you?  And he's such an animal.  I'm a pig, but not with my friends.  Yeah, see, that's just it.  That's odd, isn't it?  Is she like a sister to you?  No, but I mean, she's a comic I like a lot.  He's like, fuck his sister.  Yeah, exactly.  German scat porn with my sister. 
[02:15:30]  But I don't want to look at friends like that.  And it's not for any reason.  It's just like, I don't fucking, I try not to look at other comedians like that.  Except Patrice.  Yeah, but that's different.  But he's begging for it.  The thing about Patrice is, I don't want to fuck Patrice.  I just want to eat his ass.  Join the club.  Oh, that'd be great.  I want to bend him over.  I want to eat his ass so well, he doesn't even try to pick his hat up when it falls off.  People want me to tweet a picture of Amy, but she never plays sexy from my camera, so  I'm not going to do it.  Oh, you know what I'm thinking?  My pictures never come out as well as they should when we look at you. 
[02:16:00]  Well, I was thinking that picture that didn't wind up in Cosmo, the one where you see more,  I thought, nobody's seen that, but I thought you guys could send that out.  That is a good one.  It could be the premiere.  Oh, come on.  What a horrible.  I'll take a nice shot of you.  It's right in my eye.  That's not the first time I've said that.  I am a sexy.  That's a sexy shot.  I look like I'm a man.  That's great.  I look like I have no teeth.  Oh, God.  That's a good fucking Facebook picture. 
[02:16:30]  Speaking of in your eye, this woman the other day, I was doing an interview and she asked  me, she was like, when do you feel the most vulnerable?  And I think she thought I was going to be like, oh, when I get on stage and the crowd  doesn't know me.  I was like, probably if I've gotten any cum on my face and I'm stumbling around looking  for a napkin like Helen Keller, that's probably.  That's vulnerable, yeah.  That's pretty vulnerable.  Or, you know, if I get on an airplane, that's scary.  Like, of course.  A lot can happen to you in both of those situations.  When I'm blinded.  Going back to the Cosmo thing, the picture you showed us, why didn't they use that one? 
[02:17:00]  Is it the one where the mic stand is trying to cover your naked body?  Yeah.  That thing was a great shot.  Thank you.  Why didn't they use that?  I don't know.  They used one where I'm making like a little wacky face.  That always happens to female comics.  Wacky face.  Look at her.  She's zany.  She did it again.  Look out for her.  No, there was one where she's trying to cover up everything and it's covered up enough  where Cosmo certainly could use the picture and we didn't use it.  You can see the curve of her butt.  Ooh.  That's pretty good.  That was nice.  Yeah, you guys send that out. 
[02:17:30]  Nobody's seen that.  Oh, cool.  There is an exclusive.  I'll send it to you guys.  Yeah.  Right when I get my phone.  I'll jack off to it.  Oh, sorry.  Oh, what?  I didn't mean to actually say that.  Can we take a picture of you for the creeps out there?  All right.  The creeps.  You got any sexiness in you today?  Not really.  Let's see.  Yeah.  Why are you at, you're like, are you going to bring it?  You don't want to waste your time bringing out your phone.  Just send that picture out.  No, I hope he does all the photography. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  I just gawk like a creep.  Like the creep I am.  Why aren't you wearing pants today?  I knew you were coming in.  I only take pictures with celebrities.  Oh, shit.  That hurt.  Oh, shit.  That hurt.  This isn't creepy at all.  Wow.  I'm showing a photo shoot with a phone.  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, how coy looking.  Yeah.  That's a little coy.  Perfect picture. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, you jerk.  Oh, if I had a dime for every time somebody took a picture of me without my face in it.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  Really sweet.  You know what would be a perfect picture?  Take a picture and cut her head off.  What's your Twitter?  A perfect picture would be Brie Olsen sitting on my face while Ozzy sang to us.  Wow.  That would be a perfect picture.  That's great.  That sounds beautiful.  What a day for you.  What a way to start the day.  That would be fantastic.  Hey, did you watch this Raw Ozzy?  Oh, no.  Raw Ozzy?  No. 
[02:19:00]  I have no idea about the wedding.  I could give a shit, right?  I can't.  I've got nothing.  We did an hour and a half on it.  I guess we did give a shit.  I know.  We did.  People care.  They're having parties.  A lot of the English people give a shit that are here in New York because it is a melting  pot, as they say.  And there's these English pubs.  And it's like the biggest thing to them.  And no one here really gives a shit.  I just don't care.  They're like, we're having a new queen.  I'm like, we have enough in New York.  We don't need to celebrate this marriage.  Somebody tweeted that it was like, I think it might have been Greg Gutfeld tweeted that 
[02:19:30]  it's the Super Bowl for cat ladies, which is hysterical.  That's great.  That is so funny.  I'm so glad Greg finally found his voice.  Yes.  Isn't it great?  Oh, God.  The thing is, it was happening when we fucking came in here and every TV has got it on.  So we've got to kind of talk about it.  You can't just ignore it.  We're fags.  Why are we pretending?  We all choked up.  We're just fruits.  How do you want me to describe your picture?  The knockout gorgeous?  The lovely?  And then show them that you cut my head off. 
[02:20:00]  I didn't cut your head off?  Yes.  No, I learned that.  My mom taught me that.  Never put your face in the pictures.  Yeah.  Which I appreciate.  Yeah.  Especially some of those pictures.  Yeah.  What should I write, Jimmy?  More sexy ones.  What's that?  I want to describe her hotness.  Vivacious.  I don't know how to spell it.  Voluptuous.  Nobody does.  She's not voluptuous.  No.  Voluptuous implies you're a little chunky.  Like heavy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay, I don't mean that.  The zoptic.  Yeah.  Yeah, just confuse everyone. 
[02:20:30]  How about the putrescent?  Oh, thank you.  Wow.  Putrescent.  How about the Nazi?  Now that's sexy.  Just write a swastika and then show them a picture of my devils.  Can I go with Amy and then quotes the J.  I'm going to go with the rapable.  That's really nice.  Oh, thank you.  That's nice, right?  That's very nice.  The rapable.  The rapable.  The rapable, Amy Schumer.  Yeah, what's wrong with that?  Rapable doesn't read well because it looks like rapable.  That's true.  True.  Then maybe they think they're getting into an urban thing. 
[02:21:00]  Yeah.  The sexually assaultable.  I love that you knew that.  Oh, because they spelt it so many times ago.  Yeah.  It doesn't dignify the word rape.  I had to have all my bumper stickers remade once I saw it.  Your Honor, she looked rapable.  How about...  That's tough.  How about coy shit porn star, Amy Schumer?  Oh, my God.  Stop reading my dream journal.  Shit porn.  The molestable, Amy Schumer.  Oh, yes.  That's a good one. 
[02:21:30]  My uncle would agree.  That would be...  Yeah, yeah.  The sluggable.  Yes.  If he wanted to punch you in the face.  Well, that's what I like.  You are loved and hated.  Okay.  At both the same time.  That sounds good.  Have you noticed that on like...  How can anybody hate Amy?  She's very funny.  I don't know.  People have to hate her.  Some people don't like Amy.  And I don't think it's because of anything like her comedy or anything.  She's a woman.  They just see you.  Mm-hmm.  And it's like people are like, oh, Amy's cute.  And they're like, fuck that.  She's not cute.  And people get the lickable. 
[02:22:00]  Thank you.  The bend overable.  I like both of those things.  The taint touchable.  How do you spell exploitable?  Uh, P-A-X-P-L-O-E-T-A-B-L-E-E-X-P-L-O-I-T-A-B-L-E-E-X-P-L-O-S.  Oh, the rapeable, but with a dash.  No.  Rapeable.  No, I don't know.  Rape is something they shouldn't be in fun of.  Not unless you're going to do it.  You're going to put it in quotes.  You're going to say something like, look at Amy Schumer.  I wouldn't mind.  And then in quotes, like, taking her tap dancing. 
[02:22:30]  Some phrase that makes no sense.  Oh, God.  I don't know.  Who knows?  This picture is going to do really well for you.  Oh, thank you.  Without your head.  Yeah, what a great choice.  Because who cares about the face?  Who needs a face until the end, am I right?  As long as she's got a twat.  All right, we get it.  Amy's a big star. 
[02:23:00]  She's got a new CD out called Cutting.  Cutting?  Yes.  And she's like, where is the title?  What does it mean?  Thanks for asking that.  Sure.  Yeah, the last track, you find out why Cutting.  Yeah.  What a tease.  Teaser.  Teaser.  I know what it is.  Oh, come on.  It's what she does to rugs.  She's a real dancer.  Oh, by dancing again.  I just love dancing.  You can't stop me from dancing.  She can cut a rug off.  You get it.  How come you didn't bring any copies of the CD in?  They didn't give me physical ones for another two weeks. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, they're all physical ones.  They're digital.  Theoretical.  It's on iTunes.  Yes.  Look at that.  Well, I thanked all of you angels.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Well, that's pretty sweet.  Even Kenny with his new salt and pepper haircut.  Yeah.  Did you see that?  He's becoming like a menopausal woman.  He looks very mature.  Yeah.  And experienced.  He's an older Rachel Maddow.  Kenny's coming in.  Oh.  He's got some.  Oh, no.  He's going to start using the hair color just for dolts.  He's got info on Amy Schumer.  Oh, no.  That he wants out there. 
[02:24:00]  Hey, Dino.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  Here he is.  I had a dream about Amy last night.  You did?  What was it?  Oh.  Amy asked me to eat her pussy.  Uh-huh.  I ate most of it and took the rest in a to-go box.  Okay, Kenny.  I don't know.  No.  I can't believe how far you had to walk to come in here to sit.  I know, right?  That one needs a little work.  That needs a lot of work.  Because you said, here's why.  Because you said, eat her pussy, and it made us all uncomfortable.  He wasn't comfortable.  If you would have said, Amy, I gave Amy oral sex, it was just too vulgar for you to sit 
[02:24:30]  with Amy.  Right off the bat like that, we were kind of all shocked when you said it.  Everyone was shocked.  Yes.  I was wishing I was being shocked.  No, I have been thinking about this lately, and the guy I'm seeing right now, he doesn't  like to go down.  I have to sit on his face.  Most black men don't.  Oh.  You know, and I'm like, I wind up hanging on the edge of my bed, holding on, I feel  like a nosy neighbor, you know?  Like, I'm just like a poor criminal, like, I feel like Wilson from Tool Time. 
[02:25:00]  And it's just a lot of work to sit up there.  It's hard to really let go.  Yeah, yeah.  But you can't give them the head push, you know?  Not when they're in a neck brace.  That doesn't do well.  Do you have to really kind of, like, get down there?  He always tries to just lift me up, so I'm sitting on his head, like he likes to wear  me like a hat.  What's his problem?  Seriously, I think it's just the cerebral palsy, but I don't know.  That'll do it.  I don't know.  He always gets in his wheelchair all mad. 
[02:25:30]  There's a problem if you've got to push a guy's head down like you're reloading a jack  in the box.  It's like, what?  Yeah.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah, there's a...  It's laziness.  What kind of guy doesn't like doing that, though?  He likes it, but he just wants me to always go up top.  Oh, oh, right?  Yeah.  And kind of...  You know what, though?  I like my face sat on, too.  It's the best way.  Oh, it's the toilet face.  Oh, toilet face.  Yeah, it's it.  He looks like smelling ass.  Yeah?  Yeah, sometimes you like smelling ass, or you like the feeling of being smothered.  Tell him to get a job here at SiriusXM.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:26:00]  Yeah.  That's all we do.  Or pretend he's a chair.  Oh, no.  Chip.  Oh, Chip.  Chip is always the one that just knows how to bring it home.  Really ruin everything.  Well, I'm going to pick it up a little bit, because I just got an email from Kenny.  I hope you see.  He falls in the street.  I got an email from Kenny from over there.  He writes, Amy Schumer has a few soft core porn videos out.  Really?  Wow.  A lesbian slumber party with girl-on-girl action.  Oh, yeah.  Another with Amy at a stripper pole.  And the third video, Amy sold her eggs to finance her new CD. 
[02:26:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're all videos.  Sold your eggs.  Yeah.  That's got to be kind of more a clinical movie, I would think, called Harvesting Eggs.  Well, it winds up being not clinical.  It's just a video I made to promote my CD, but it's about me donating my eggs, but jerking  off into a jar.  Oh, that's good.  Is that how girls donate their eggs?  That's how it happens.  A lot of people don't know.  They just fucking diddle themselves into a jar, and the eggs come out and just plop out.  They give you a copy of Rosemary's Baby.  Do your business. 
[02:27:00]  That's how it worked for me.  Sounds fun.  Yeah, I made a little video with other female comics, Rachel Feinstein and Nikki Glaser and  Marina, and we have a little slumber party.  And I'm not gay, like, at all.  Like, I'll catch a finger on a Friday once in a while, but that's because I like fun.  But it's, yeah, it's just a little video we made.  Who's Nikki Glaser?  I know that voice.  Yeah, she's a comedian.  She's really funny.  I know I know the name.  Yeah, you've met her a hundred times.  Have I?  Yeah, it's so funny.  I always see, you always meet her, and you're like, oh, nice to meet you.  It's not to be a dick.  And I see her heartbreak just a little because she loves you guys. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, no.  Oh, no, I know it's not to be a dick.  Oh, I'm sorry.  You're famous.  Can I, Danny, can you look up Nikki?  Is it N-I-K-K-I?  Yeah.  Okay.  I probably know her by face.  I'm just very bad with names.  Yeah, she's really funny.  Glaser, G-L-A.  Is it S-E-R?  S-E-R.  Amy?  I got her name right.  Amy, they're begging for an upskirt.  Can I do an upskirt?  What's that?  Like, seeing my pussy?  I think, oh, come on, Kenny.  It looks like this.  I'll just show you with my hands.  Oh, that's not a good picture of Nikki.  That's a terrible picture of Nikki. 
[02:28:00]  She's beautiful.  Oh, man.  Look at that.  Oh, look at those pictures.  That looks good.  Yeah.  Where is this bitch?  Where's the other one?  Okay, yeah.  There are better pictures of her.  And there's pictures of you and her doing what?  With terrible things together.  We made a video.  That's a good picture right there.  Yeah, she's really cute.  Yeah, she's all right.  The slumber party video.  It's on YouTube.  She was on, what was she on?  Last Comic?  She was on Last Comic, yeah.  Yeah, I recognize her.  Are you in PJs?  Yeah, we're in lingerie.  Yeah.  Little lingerie?  Yeah.  Do you jump on the bed? 
[02:28:30]  Do you jump on the bed?  I'm trying to get them to dyke out with me the whole time, but they never go for it.  They never les out with you?  I think Marina has a moment where she's thinking about it.  Yeah.  Oh.  But yeah.  Slumber party.  What have we got here?  There it is.  The top one.  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Lady Comic Slumber Party, it's called.  There it is.  Yeah.  It's hot.  The slumber party.  All right.  Let's check this out.  So, why is Rachel having the slumber party again?  Oh, because she just like really wanted to.  That's you and Nikki?  That's me and Nikki.  Marina. 
[02:29:00]  All right.  So, why did she ask us to let you go?  Oh, Chelsea was supposed to do this, but she backed out because she realized it was  going to be like us just being a horse.  You're so pretty and you're so soft.  Oh, thanks.  I feel bad.  This so looks like a porno.  I know.  I know.  I know.  You just like, no.  Sam, boo.  What's up, son?  She's trying to be out of black.  Oh, Rachel.  Yeah.  Hey, why is she here?  Oh, Chelsea couldn't make it, so I just brought Nikki.  Why are you guys dressed like giant babies?  We thought it would be fun.  I got one for you, too. 
[02:29:30]  All right.  Oh, it's sitting on the couch.  Yeah, legs crossed.  Can we please take this off?  Let's change.  Oh, wow.  Heath and DeRosa called Rachel to make fun of her about the video, because he was like,  you're wearing pig pails.  You always have a female boss.  How are you?  Just Puerto Rican girl earrings in, Rachel.  So, what are we doing?  Oh, my God.  Let's try kissing each other. 
[02:30:00]  Ah!  Oh, my God.  I'm joking.  First of all, I'm joking.  That's weird.  No, I was supposed to be talking to Harry.  Do the booty clap.  How about we do summer party stuff?  Yes.  Yes.  You ain't wasted.  You're so awkward.  It's awkward.  It's great.  Lies and feathers.  How about we just circle your problem areas? 
[02:30:30]  What?  Oh, shit.  They're all lighting candles now.  We're just lighting a cigar.  A blunt.  A blunt, yo.  You've been out of the game.  I really am too silver.  We wanted us to appeal to the shade.  The shade network.  This thing is broken.  This doesn't work.  So, it looks like it's spelled dyke.  Does it spell dyke?  Yeah.  Oh, you're painting a little mustache on our friend.  A little Hitler mustache.  She's like Hitler. 
[02:31:00]  Oh, my God.  Because she fell asleep.  Who put my hand in warm water?  Ew!  No one!  You guys saw it over.  Who's?  Pillow fight.  With our shirts off.  No, you mound-guzzling monster dyke.  Where is it at?  Why don't we play skeletons in the closet?  Nikki kills me here.  Okay.  Okay.  One time, yesterday, I rub mayonnaise on my dog's genitals, and then I licked it off.  I think I left the oven on at home. 
[02:31:30]  How come Rita doesn't talk?  He liked it, though.  I don't know.  I mean...  I think she was regretting the decision to make this video.  That's great.  I think I'm going to get out of here, too.  It was Miracle Whip.  Get on with that.  I wish that was true.  Rachel, you live here.  I'm moving to Harlem.  Do you have a dog?  It's funny.  Thank you.  It's definitely good, man.  Thank you.  It's called Lady...  It's a good actress.  What is it?  Lady...  Move that thing.  I can't, because YouTube is just like it. 
[02:32:00]  Lady Comic Slumber Party on YouTube, if you want to check it out.  Very good.  Jamie is a good actress.  Thank you.  Yeah, you come across very natural.  It's very good.  It was easy.  I really want to make out with all this girls.  Because you really wanted to make out with them.  Yeah.  I like making Marina Franklin uncomfortable.  Yeah, it looked it.  It was fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, usually, you know, girl comics.  I don't know.  I know.  I think you found a few there that are kind of funny.  Oh, thank you.  Those chicks are funny.  You know the stigma with the girl comic. 
[02:32:30]  They all fuck for cash.  I know.  But yeah, yeah.  They all fuck for cash.  Yeah.  Well, people, you know, they're like, Amy, you and your friends.  Like, this is an attractive group of girls.  Sure.  But the truth is, we were all abused.  So, that's how...  Is that it?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's the only way you'd actually get a funny girl with a personality.  It makes sense.  You need one with the daddy issues.  Yep.  Or abuse issues.  We've all got them.  Sure.  Something like that.  Daddy.  That works.  Daddies that don't love their daughters are my whole fucking life. 
[02:33:00]  What would you do?  What would you do?  I would be the loneliest guy in the world.  No.  I would be so fucking lonely if it wasn't for the bad dads.  You should take all the dads out to lunch.  I thank them.  The girls you back, yeah.  That's just it.  They weren't around.  Thank you.  They were never around.  If you could just get them to RSVP once.  If you could find them.  Yeah.  I think I only got contacted with one father in my entire, like, dating career.  And that was, uh, that was, uh, this, uh, guy, this girl was probably 16 and I was just 
[02:33:30]  out of high school.  Like, so it was 30.  You graduated high school in your 40.  And I, I was pick, I was picking a robin shit and, and, and the father was like, oh,  let me drive you home.  I'm like, oh, here comes the talk.  And he worked at like, uh, for Caterpillar, that fucking big machinery company.  So he was a man and everything.  And I'm just some dumb kid with my big, a dumb Jew afro and shit.  I looked like fucking horrible and everything.  Love.  And, and then the guy was just telling me, he goes, you know, my daughter and, uh, I'm 
[02:34:00]  not really, I'm not really happy about this, but, uh, I don't want to make her rebel against  me.  So I'm going to allow this.  And I'm just sitting there like, uh, now, you know, knowing, I think, you know, what  you know now at this age, and you just turn around and I'd probably just, you know,  tell him, Hey, let me suck your dick.  Right.  Right.  And then that would settle it down.  You're there for him too.  It always works.  I would be there for him.  So I was like, all right.  And then for the next year that I was going out with this girl, he would drive her to 
[02:34:30]  my house every weekend to hang out and we would just have sex.  So he was like.  What did she do?  Yes.  Exactly.  And, and, and he would, he would drop her off like, like a pimp dropping off a whore.  Just for you to fuck her.  It was a, it was your daughter.  If you're listening, you dropped her off in the house so we could have sexual intercourse.  That reminds me of that, that one porn, you know, the casting, the casting one where  he's like, it's not a real, this is not a real casting. 
[02:35:00]  You know, and the girls, and the guy, uh, he's like, okay, now you have to blow me.  And the girls always come in and sometimes they're dropped off by their fathers or their  boyfriends and they're like, the guy will meet the boyfriend and he just takes them  from the boyfriend to go fuck them.  To go fuck them.  Yeah.  And the girl always starts out like, I'm my boyfriend.  And by the end, just getting railed from behind.  Oh, she's fucking just coming in the face.  Pulling your own toes.  Do you like those?  Yeah.  I do like those.  Oh, you like those?  Yeah.  The casting couch ones?  I like those, yeah. 
[02:35:30]  But seriously, you guys, um, this is going to be boring, but I cannot achieve orgasm watching  porn unless the girl's getting double penetrated.  I know it's hack.  I know it's hack, but.  And by double, you mean one in each ear.  One in each eye.  Cock like earmuffs.  And I like it to be a UN.  I like it to be like one of each race.  Oh, really?  Like a Benetton ad in the bedroom.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, I can't stand watching interracial.  I know.  I know that about you.  I don't mind it, though.  It's, it's, it's not my fetish, but I don't mind watching a BBC and a fucking white mouth, 
[02:36:00]  uh, just cause it's dirty, but it doesn't, it's not a fetish of mine at all.  Yeah.  Me neither.  I've never.  The white guy banging the black broad.  I don't mind that.  That's too normal to me.  That's like, ah, whatever.  But when you see a black guy, uh, on the, on the white chick, you're just like, oh, what  did she do?  Oh, what did she do?  And she's, she's done.  Yeah.  And goodbye.  Yeah.  I've never slept with a black guy.  I should though.  Oh, Amy.  I know.  I'm waiting for next February.  Is that it?  I feel like I want to get affirmative action.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you have a whole month. 
[02:36:30]  Bring it back to me.  Yeah.  Do that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm not racist.  Like, my best friend is black in this story.  Yeah.  She's great.  Uh, judge them by the content of Amy's vagina.  That's right.  That's right.  That's what I say.  No, they're all those stereotypes.  That's the color of their skin.  My friend.  I fucked a few black broads.  Yeah?  What'd you think?  How was it?  I mean, I was, I was as bad as I normally am with white broads.  Oh, okay.  But there was no difference.  Did you feel worse?  A little bit.  Like, yeah.  Like, you knew you were disappointing them just a little more.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:37:00]  I was representing poorly.  They're like, oh.  Because that stereotype is probably true to them.  Like, the black guy stereotype is true to the white girl.  Yeah.  Right.  Uh, it's like, oh, here's another lousy white man fuck.  Yeah.  Wasting my time.  Yeah.  Wasting my motherfucking time, yo.  I could be having my herded.  Oh.  Mm.  God damn it.  I've been liking watching Indian people have sex lately.  Really?  Yeah.  Has that been a fetish thing?  I don't know.  I think so.  Like, it's just, you know, not white. 
[02:37:30]  Aren't they women hairy?  Yeah, they are hairy.  It's just anything but white.  You're just tired of white.  Yeah, I think it makes me feel better.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, I shave there.  Yeah, the women are hairy, but it's like a straight hair, right?  Yeah.  It's like they got this straight cousin it kind of hair going all over the fucking world.  You're like, who's that third guy?  Oh, no, that's her pussy.  Oh, that's the jit.  That's her asshole.  I thought this was gay porn.  Her pussy has hair like Demetri Martin.  They get really fucking hairy.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, yeah.  Indian chicks get, like, hairy. 
[02:38:00]  They got those, like, perma mustache thing, and it's like...  I love that we're talking about this over the footage of the royal wedding right now.  Well, yeah.  Indian pussy.  Well, we're giving it nothing but respect, obviously.  We're waiting for the big pussy eating on the balcony.  Oh, I can't wait to hear it.  When he puts her over the rail and just gives her a little lick.  She's going to be miserable tonight.  It looks like the most boring medieval times ever.  Yeah.  Look at this.  Serving sangria.  Yeah, where's my roast?  It's like a British Trump.  That's what I was thinking. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Yeah, look at that.  Well, it's a big, big day in Great Britain.  It sure is, Anne.  I'd love to be brought out just to wave so they could all go, who the fuck is this asshole?  It's Jimmy Norton, the ugly American.  Oh.  Aw.  Aw, way to stop the fun.  I don't mean literally.  I meant figuratively.  We're all of the ugly American, though, overseas, aren't we?  Oh, gorgeous.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  Don't they hate us everywhere?  They do.  Do you travel internationally, Amy?  Yeah, I've traveled a little bit.  I've only done, outside of America, I've only done stand-up in Sweden, in Stockholm. 
[02:39:00]  Sweden.  How was it?  How did that work out?  It was good.  They all speak, they speak perfect English.  Yeah, that's good.  They're all speaking Swedish, so you feel like they, you know, like you can make fun of them in front  of them, and they'll be like, what'd you just say?  And I'm like, oh, shit.  In perfect English.  Oh, shit, yeah.  And how do you make fun of a Swede?  You can't.  They're so hot.  You're gorgeous.  They're so hot.  They're all hot.  I would say, like, why don't you get a bunch of meatballs and stuff?  I would just kill them.  Oh, I don't know, Chip.  That's just cruel, Chip.  Chip, I don't know.  Yeah, that's just mean. 
[02:39:30]  Seems rude.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, they have, like.  Yeah.  They have hot people.  They do.  Like, I, the hottest guy I saw in Sweden, no joke, was in the airport.  He was working at, they had a Pizza Hut in their airport.  And, like, he was, I was like, I'll leave my life in New York for you.  He was so.  For a Pizza Hut worker.  Think about the people who work at Pizza Hut at, like, LaGuardia.  Oh, please.  They're, like, really retarded.  Yeah.  Not, like, a little, you know, not like a little limp.  Like, they're the kind that looks like they're just making fun of retarded people. 
[02:40:00]  With how fucked up.  You're, like, toning down.  It's, like, you can't possibly.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're, like, that's just rude.  You're, like, oh, no, that's really your life.  That's.  Oh, that's horrible.  I know.  But over there, just gorgeous people.  Just beautiful.  They are.  Yeah.  Where else have you been?  You have been, uh.  Yeah, I went all over Italy, Spain.  Damn.  I went to the Oktoberfest.  Yeah.  Was it, like, a rom-com?  Were you going around just meeting guys that were, like, uh, you know.  Did I fool around with anybody? 
[02:40:30]  I did, but now that I know.  No, I'm, like, oh, you guys just look Mexican.  No matter where you go.  Yeah.  It's, like, you're too tan.  I don't know.  You missed something in there.  She went to Oktoberfest.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Were you a drunken mess over there, Amy?  Yeah.  Oh.  Absolutely.  Oh, I was in a full blackout.  Like, I woke up in Lederhosen.  I was, like, why is this old German man here?  Did you keep yelling at them to spell October with a C?  Yeah, hey, you dummies.  That K just looks creepy on the fucking poster. 
[02:41:00]  Whenever you see a K in a word like that, you just think a lot of dead Jewish people.  I know.  Holocaust.  Yeah.  It just really kind of looks Holocaust-y.  Amy took her tits out and ran through Oktoberfest yelling, I forgive you.  Oh, well.  Oh, shit.  You know, if it happened.  If it happened.  Who knows?  That's kind of cool, though, being able to go over there and do that.  They're doing the SNL bit on local TV, everyone. 
[02:41:30]  What is that?  Gang, sorry.  You're right.  You're right.  Oh, shit.  Let me tell you something.  The Brits.  The Union of Two Solene.  Fuck it.  Oh, it's the Fox people.  They're all dressed like people.  Oh, that is exciting.  Oh, come on.  Like they're actually inside the wedding.  It's the news, you fuckers.  Oh.  Oh, they even had people play the fucking couple.  Are you kidding me?  But the guy's wearing a suit instead of a red outfit.  As well as the best of times.  Is it William or is it Nate?  He's really lost his locks.  What happened to him? 
[02:42:00]  Rosanna, you are right.  Rosanna Scato.  Tell you what, Wills, no offense, but you so would not be getting Kate if it wasn't for  you about to become king.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  And speaking of Kate, there is Kate's younger and hotter sister, Pippa.  Pippa, what's up?  Yo, Pippa, you want some popcorn?  Don't be a snob.  This is the news.  Yes.  Prince Harry.  Prince Harry.  Who the fuck would laugh at this?  Hi, I remember that there was a tornado. 
[02:42:30]  Go Manchester.  All right, Harry's cool, huh?  How about that?  Why is Harry being played by a Jamaican?  They don't like us here.  I'm sick of these people looking down on us, Greg.  You know what?  Let's look down on us.  This is great.  This is just like, I feel like I'm in the improv club at Disney World.  This is so cool.  You can do this in a dream.  I feel like I'm getting AIDS watching this.  This is horrible.  This popcorn's going to be kind of handy.  Try it.  I love it.  I love it.  Hey, take that, you limeys.  Terrible.  Hey, by the way, England. 
[02:43:00]  She just said, take that, you limeys.  Some people you didn't invite.  Ladies and gentlemen, that's pretty funny.  Meet Mr. Donald Trump.  Excuse me.  Excuse me.  People write their sketches, though.  That's weird.  What the fuck are they doing?  Take this, you limeys.  She said, take this, you limeys.  A kraut and a jigger in the crowd, too.  I changed my opinion about this.  I like it a lot.  All of a sudden, it's great.  But a nice guy.  Slightly effeminate.  Well-mannered.  Oh, it's Trump impressions.  Sir, sit down.  Excuse me.  Although I like the English. 
[02:43:30]  Is this their last day doing this?  Is that maybe what they just decided?  This is their going-out party.  Let's fucking blow this shit up.  This is really not good.  What are they doing, man?  I feel like somewhere in the Fox broadcasting studio,  somebody is running full steam towards a red phone.  Yeah, yeah.  Or out a window.  Exactly.  It's like one sucker proxy.  They're all trying to kill themselves.  Does not have a birth certificate.  He could have been born anywhere.  They're getting really upset,  and they're about to get angrier, Rosanna.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah, angry at this bit. 
[02:44:00]  How long is this fucking sketch?  Can you believe this?  Kim Kardashian.  William Harry, remember me from the bachelor party?  For richer or richer.  Maybe Millionaire Matchmaker.  What the fuck are they doing?  It's going on forever.  It really is.  A lovely one.  They're quitting.  All right, well.  Great bet.  There you go.  Great bet.  Wow.  That is horrifying.  I got camera tricks and everything.  I don't know.  That was not good.  The odds are not good.  Not good.  I've had it.  Where are you going to be, Amy?  Are you going anywhere? 
[02:44:30]  No.  What, are we kicking her out?  No, I just want to know if she's going to be somewhere.  He means like tonight.  Yeah, what's that?  Yeah, yeah, like tonight.  I'll be at a bar fly on a face in a glass of whiskey.  I'm going to go there straight from here.  And you're doing your TV show still?  Yeah, Fridays at 11.  With Hoppus?  Mm-hmm.  Hoppus on music.  Ours was on, I think, right?  Jimmy was on.  Yeah.  Yeah, Stoop.  I didn't see that.  Yeah, Stoop was the...  No?  Not together.  Thank you.  He was the interview guest, and I was on the panel.  Very cool.  Yeah, they got this picture where Jim pretended he didn't hate black people. 
[02:45:00]  It was perfect.  That was an old one.  Hey, who was I with?  I was sitting next to a very beautiful black woman.  I don't remember her name.  She was very nice.  Michelle Obama?  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Florida Evans?  We did...  I fucked her, actually.  Oh, Alicia Quarles.  Yes.  The chick you were on with, she's great.  Was she a journalist?  She's from the AP.  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah, she's really...  She's good.  Any stories from the TV show?  Anyone cool?  Anything?  Nothing?  Oh, God.  Sorry.  I went...  We got drunk by accident. 
[02:45:30]  On the air?  Yeah.  By accident?  How does that happen?  Yeah, this band was like, oh, we make our own whiskey, and they didn't tell us that  it was a million proof.  Like, it's the kind of thing you drink, and you're...  Yeah, it burned, like, unbelievable.  And then we had to do the rest of the show, and I was slurring.  You know, not usually, like, when I slur, and it's just, like, racial slurs.  It's, like, very specific.  And they kept having to put more makeup, because we were all flush.  But, no, nothing too crazy.  Yeah.  Sorry. 
[02:46:00]  I'm so good at doing PR for the show.  You are quite the party girl, though, right?  You do, like...  Amy's a drunk tip in a few bags.  Yeah.  I like...  I'm not afraid of a great time.  Yeah.  I'll black myself out.  Yeah.  It's tough, though.  You know, when you know you're going to have to be on camera or something, that'll keep  you...  You can see booze in me really quick.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I like the slow memory comeback, where it's like, what?  Oh, oh.  Here comes a chunk.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah.  God, I shouldn't have let that cab driver finger me. 
[02:46:30]  I know.  I know.  I'm going to call my mom so I feel better about it.  Or when you go to text somebody, and then you look at your text and go, uh-oh.  Yeah.  And you start scrolling through and you go, oh, no, I didn't.  Or if you have to mass text people, I'm sorry.  Yeah.  That's a bad one.  I just let me fill the names in.  Like, oh, I'm sorry, mom.  Thank God Twitter wasn't around when I drank.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  It is so bad.  That would have been a bad one.  So bad.  Oh.  Or when you think of, like, the awful, embarrassing things you would do as a teen, like, broken-hearted 
[02:47:00]  and drunk.  And, like, you'd write a letter, and then you realize the next day, it's like, fuck this  shit.  I'm not doing anything.  My pain.  I'm not doing anything.  I'm not doing anything.  I'm not doing anything.  I'm not doing anything.  Oh, you would fucking just be like, you are everything.  The embarrassment.  Impulsively just press send.  Yeah, yeah.  It's gone.  It's out there forever.  It's out there.  And here's a picture of me.  And it's just you crying.  Do you want to put me through this, you bitch?  Yeah.  Thank God.  How embarrassing.  All this stuff.  Or even just, like, to be a 12-year-old. 
[02:47:30]  I've been reading my, like, journals to have Twitter then.  I, like, wrote journals.  And I was just like, what a fucking loser.  Yeah, 12 to 22.  Well, bring him in.  I kept the journal.  Wow.  I thought about bringing him in.  Read those fucking things.  I have this whole, I was reading this thing about me, this guy going down on me on a cruise  ship.  And you were 12?  No.  He was the captain.  Yes, of course.  He said he was the captain.  No, I was 19, but, because I think, you know, now with any time I've been on television  or, like, on here, I'm, like, thinking there's some dude out there, like, oh, I ate her out 
[02:48:00]  on a cruise ship, you know?  Like, that guy's out there flipping through the channels.  It was the Amistad.  Oh, you haven't seen the video.  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  Wow.  That was, uh, did you hook up on the cruise ship?  Yeah, we hooked up on the cruise ship.  And it's me, like, just, I wrote about all, I kept, uh, you know, what a great hookup.  Yeah.  It was awesome.  But then I'm, like, and then I, yeah, I, I wrote, like, and I came and then, uh, I  think I, I don't know.  I, I, I think I jerked him off.  And then I was like, and then I held him as long as I felt he needed it. 
[02:48:30]  And then I got the fuck out of there.  I wrote that.  I actually wrote that.  Then I got the fuck out of there?  I got the fuck out of there.  Yeah.  You're on a ship, though.  It's kind of hard to avoid each other.  I was on a ship.  Um, I was on a cruise with my grandma.  Wow.  No joke.  Did she get any?  Yeah, did she jerk anyone off?  Yeah.  She's who I jerked off.  And then I got the fuck out of there.  And then I got the fuck out of there.  Spooned grandma.  She gave the guy a good prostate check while he was fucking, grandma gave him the strap  on.  Like, is this thing on?  Well, that's like a romantic Titanic kind of story, isn't it? 
[02:49:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Without, you know, the sinking and death.  Right.  Without all those icebergs getting in the way.  This is for you, Amy.  Oh.  Since you remember jerking off that guy.  I jerked a gentleman off.  Somewhere he's out there.  In a Model T below deck.  Oh.  We ran through the engine room watching people shovel coal as I jerked his cock off.  And my grandmother and some guy she met were just laying in the bunk as the water filled  the room.  Oh, man.  Oh, the second class. 
[02:49:30]  The unsinkable Molly Brown spot as I tongued her asshole.  Brings back such memories.  Why not?  Why not?  Why?  That's what I say.  When Jimmy says why, I say why not?  And that guy wrote in his journal, I can't believe I ate her pussy and all she would do  is jerk me off.  Oh, God.  Exclamation points.  Oh, God.  Worst cruise ever.  I know.  That is pretty cool, though.  He's probably still, he scored a handjob on a cruise.  Oh, he thinks about that.  Of course he does.  He thinks about that.  He's so hot. 
[02:50:00]  Like, I could not believe it that I, like, got this guy.  And I'm showing my friends pictures.  And they were like, is he wearing sandals with socks?  Oh, no.  And a shell necklace?  And I was like, oh, whoops.  Do you have puka shells on?  Yeah.  He was so hot.  All right.  He's cool.  What a zilch.  I know.  No, he was not cool.  He had sandals with socks?  Yeah, definitely not cool.  And you jerked him off to completion?  Yeah.  Fucking Greek tourist ate her pussy.  It's awful.  That's what the tourist is about.  Everyone should have seen it. 
[02:50:30]  Yes.  He lubed my ass with mint jelly and put a finger in it.  Look, you celebrate Thanksgiving how you want, okay?  Let's not judge each other's cultures.  That guy, what a fucking stud.  If you can get jerked off while wearing sandals and socks, you are a fucking man.  On a cruise ship.  That's great.  I thought he was Jesus.  Were you drunk during that?  Yeah, but I was psyched.  We'd been hanging out for a couple days and I didn't even know he was into me.  And then I was like, oh, great.  Obviously, he wasn't, though.  Yeah. 
[02:51:00]  Disappointing for him.  Yeah.  I never heard from him again.  I don't know why.  Maybe because you laminated his face and only gave him a handjob.  He's hoping to get blown.  He's making his fucking cum leak over your knuckles.  Look, if you have a face, I'm going to use it as a seat.  What is your problem?  That's a cute story.  I respect that, though.  Fuck it.  You got what she wanted and that was that.  Good for you.  It was a satisfying cruise.  That's great, man.  You're a fucking good girl.  I'm so glad I got to work on it.  We got a timing issue.  We got a break. 
[02:51:30]  All right.  Bring it.  Have we a break?  Hey, trust me, it's stupid to break here, but we just fucking have to because we got  to sell Mother's Day shit.  Okay.  Amy Schumer is here.  The new CD is called Cutting.  Cutting.  And we're going to continue with Amy, but we do have to break here, unfortunately.  And Kevin Pollack is also.  And we'll have him come in, too.  Yeah, absolutely.  Sorry that we have to break here, but it has nothing to do with us.  Yeah, we went 90 minutes to the first one.  So we have to fucking catch up.  Amy's killing today.  Amy Schumer, everyone.  Sirius XM.  The virus.  This is the OB and Anthony Show. 
[02:52:00]  The OB and Anthony Show.  Busy show today.  Yes.  We got Amy Schumer in studio.  She's promoting her new CD, Cutting.  That's going to be available on iTunes?  iTunes and Amazon.  Very good.  We're very excited for Amy Schumer.  It's about time.  And hi, Kevin.  Kevin Pollack is in.  Kevin Pollack has entered the studio.  Please don't get up.  With his Raiders of the Lost Ark t-shirt.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Vintage.  Is that an original, or is that one of the new ones they make that kind of just looks like retro? 
[02:52:30]  I think it's retro bullshit, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I want to start by telling Kevin I saw him in Red State, man.  How about that?  I fucking liked Red State.  Didn't see that coming, though, my thing.  No, not at all.  I don't want to say too much.  I haven't seen it.  Yeah, exactly.  A lot of firepower in that movie.  That's why I shouldn't say too much.  A lot of firepower in that movie.  Actor, comedian, Kevin Pollack.  Yes, that's what I like saying.  Easy.  Hey, you've been in some big ones, man.  You've been in some great freaking movies.  My batting average is shit, but I have been in some good ones.  No, you've been in some good ones, man.  Before we go to the older ones, Red State is going to be all right. 
[02:53:00]  It's going to find its audience, I think.  Yeah, it has already.  And we're really good friends with Kevin Smith, so we're excited for him in the new movie, Red State.  How can you not be?  I mean, if you like him already.  And he even got his wife involved.  She was firing all over the fucking place.  It's true.  His wife's in it, and she's doing a really good job as a religious freak that has to shoot the bad guys.  He likes popping the wife in a movie ever so often.  Well, that might happen.  Yeah.  Oh, popping the wife?  No, he likes popping her in the movie.  Not popping her in the movie, which would mean having some kind of sex with her in the movie. 
[02:53:30]  No, or popping the wife.  Or shooting her in the movie.  That might happen.  You're going to have to see Red State for yourself to see what Kevin does to his wife in the end.  I had to back off following him on Twitter a little bit.  I love him.  He does tweet.  Because he talks a little too much about ass play with the wife.  I was like, on Twitter, and I thought, you know, this is great.  Good for you.  But I don't know that I need this in my life right now.  I'm having cereal.  Yeah, it's like, oh.  Does he bang his wife in the ass?  Is what he's tweeting.  That's nice. 
[02:54:00]  He does tweet that he's not a new follower.  Amy likes the ass play tweets.  Sign me up.  It's amazing.  She just, she loves them.  Yeah, Kevin, though, has been in, like, some just classic movie.  Sure.  Fucking Casino.  That is a good one.  Which was a great one.  Usual Suspects.  Oh, fuck you.  Which was another amazing.  It's like, how that.  Suspects, it's lightning in a bottle, that movie.  And if you need, you needn't any further proof than the fact that Stephen Baldwin's really  good in the film. 
[02:54:30]  Yes.  There you go.  Yeah.  It's a goddamn miracle.  Anyone.  I mean, he's really good.  Anyone can be good in that one.  And then, like, a lemming just right off the edge.  Yeah.  That's it.  When I'm done.  How are you able to do that, go from comedy into, and I know, I've seen comedians go into  acting, and, yeah, it's, you know, a few movies that are like, huh, I don't know.  But you getting into some, you know, prime movies.  You gotta suck the right dick.  I'm not gonna lie.  Is that it?  All right.  Yeah.  I knew that.  I've always said, it's gotta be the right dick.  Yeah.  No, no, no. 
[02:55:00]  That's not it at all.  What am I talking about?  That's not what happened.  Wait.  How did that come out of me?  Well, it's bad.  No, it's a lot of times it's just sheer right place, crazy sort of thing.  Hundreds of auditions first, where they say, how about anyone but you is gonna get the  part?  Oh, really?  Literally.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God, yeah.  Because I came from stand-up comedy, and I had no formal training.  I really didn't know what the fuck I was doing.  Oh, so you were stand-up first.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  That's why, like, the first time I saw it, and I think it was in Usual Suspects, it was 
[02:55:30]  kind of like, what the fuck is he doing in this?  That's what my friends said, too.  All my friends said, what the fuck do you think you're doing?  What are you, an actor?  You're not a badass.  Oh, you're an actor now?  Oh, what are you doing?  Or just that my character was a badass, so they were like, nah, this is bullshit.  Yeah, you're like a badass.  When you get up in Baldwin's face and say, do you want to dance?  Shut up.  Yeah, none of my friends could handle that at all.  I thought I was a complete tool.  You know what I loved in Casino I thought was so great was the lighting that Scorsese  did.  The lighting in that movie is so fucking amazing, and what an interesting choice and thing 
[02:56:00]  to do.  This DP, Bob Richardson, he did a few good men.  I worked with him twice, but he did all of Oliver Stone's stuff.  Oh, should we explain to Amy, though, what this DP is?  It's a different DP than yours.  Yeah, yeah.  Yes.  I'm sorry.  I'm confused.  I'm talking about double penetration.  Oh, see, then it is the one that she knows.  We speak the same language every year.  Amy likes to jerk off guys on cruise ships, apparently.  I was listening.  We were all there.  But, hey, he brought up the ass play, which sometimes does not feel like play at all. 
[02:56:30]  I wouldn't think.  It's ass work.  It really is.  Before we get back to Kevin, a lot of guys want to know why you didn't blow the guy on  the cruise ship, and you only jerked him off.  Oh, it's simple.  I was 19.  I was not good at all at giving blowjobs, and I was embarrassed.  That's okay, though.  It's honest.  But my eye and hands are steel.  Yeah, I learned later.  It's a bad one.  Now I'm a goddamn Hoover.  I know what I'm doing, but at the time, it just would have looked like an old person trying  to eat their peas, you know, just like a lot of trying to hide your teeth and spitting 
[02:57:00]  all over yourself.  Trust me.  He got the better.  He got the better deal.  Better to just take the handy and all-you-could-eat shrimp.  Yeah.  And he got the better memory.  Yeah, yeah.  The midnight chocolate buffet.  This 19-year-old came at me like.  He went and saw the magician, and then I made magic with my left.  That would have been.  You're right.  You made a wise choice.  Yeah.  What a horrible experience for him it would have been for a 19-year-old old woman to come 
[02:57:30]  out.  No, it would have looked like the end of Awakenings.  Like, nobody wants me near their cock at the time.  Oh, no.  When he's trying to build the house, and he just keeps knocking the shit out of the way.  Oh, no.  The medicine's not working.  It's wearing off.  Oh, boy.  How awkward.  Robin, you lied.  You were great in Awakenings, by the way.  Oh, thank you very much.  I loved your scene.  Thank you very much.  Yes, of course.  The incomparable and famous impressions of our Kevin Pollack.  Oh, dear God.  Oh, dear God. 
[02:58:00]  We all know.  No, it's a lot.  It really...  No, they're fantastic.  You know what stinks is that you'll...  Like, I ran into your guy's pal, who I love, Jay Moore.  And I was telling him that he was the first one to do Christopher Walken, and I was saying,  you know, you...  I said, at one point, you had a conversation with me, because I was with Chris McCrory,  the guy that wrote Usual Suspects, and we ran into Jay, and we were like...  Because Chris does a great one, too.  We were in Jay's face saying, what's the secret?  What's the fucking magic?  And Jay said, every single syllable word becomes a two-syllable word when doing Walken. 
[02:58:30]  So the word no becomes now.  And Jay was the master, you know?  And then I started doing it, and then Kevin Spacey did it, of course, and now there's like  10,000 people that do it, and so it became like the Nicholson of the 90s, you know?  So it's weird doing the impressions when somebody sort of lays claim to something, and I'm always  like, listen, go to the original person.  I'm a facsimile.  Because you absolutely have a claim to the Shatner. 
[02:59:00]  I mean, I don't think anybody has done a sample.  Yeah, that's like, what?  So now nobody can do a Shatner.  I do your...  You know, Dana Carvey and I started out together in San Francisco, late 70s, and we got our  Carson from Rich Little.  I mean, it all comes from somebody.  Rich Little did the best Carson, but it seemed like...  But never funny.  After a while, Rich, never funny.  Oh, God, no.  And it seemed like, Rich, after a while, everyone became Carson, doing an impression of Nixon,  or Carson doing this guy.  He did a lousy... 
[02:59:30]  He did a lousy...  Rich Little did a very lousy Pink Panther, though, when he tried to do Clouseau, and  he did a really long one.  Oh, God.  And it was just awful.  Horrible.  And awful.  I thought Steve Martin's bet was bad.  He was fucking terrible.  When they come out with that suit with the lapels like a fighter plane wing.  And then I have to go to this.  It's like just fucking humiliating yourself.  I liked the...  Growing up, I liked the turnaround impressionists, where they would turn around and come back.  That is the...  Frank Gorshin used to do that.  Frank Gorshin was the turnaround guy. 
[03:00:00]  Did he start that?  Did Nixon.  Yeah, they would do something to their hair.  They would mess it up and then turn around and, hey, here comes the impression.  But you forgot that it sounds a little...  Yeah, and they would go...  And I think it would go something like this.  It's just so...  I was so aware, even at a really young age, that those guys were complete fucking hacks.  I mean, even when I'm like 12 years old, I thought, I am never going to do Jack Nicholson  as a busboy.  You know what I mean?  That's just not going to happen. 
[03:00:30]  So I would create scenarios, you know, like I did the Star Trek thing where Shatner was  him and everybody else on the Enterprise had been replaced by somebody famous.  Right, yeah, yeah.  So Reverend Jim Ignatowski was Spock.  You know what I mean?  It was that kind of bullshit.  And then now I just talk about how I've ended up meeting these people, which is really fucking  weird, because that was never the plan.  I was just going to mock them and then not meet them, you know?  And so I talk about meeting Christopher Walken for the first time.  You know, he got one of the hands and feet in cement in front of the Chinese Theater in 
[03:01:00]  Hollywood Boulevard, right?  So they asked me to be one of the two speakers, which is fucking crazy, because I'd never met  him, right?  I mean, I couldn't help but think, how far down the list did you have to go?  How many no's did you get?  Yeah, I mean, exactly.  Because I knew they had at least a half a dozen no's.  I mean, Quentin Tarantino was the other speaker who directed in Pulp Fiction.  They know each other.  So what am I doing?  So obviously I'm there because of the impersonation.  This is ridiculous.  So they take me inside the theater where they're waiting to go out front, right, for the ceremony.  And I see him, and he goes, hi. 
[03:01:30]  They told me you were coming.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thanks.  And I'm thinking, he's doing the voice.  Yeah, that's the guy.  And it's way better than mine.  And then that's the fucked up thing, is that, you know, you meet the actual person, and you're  suddenly a retard.  I mean, you're instantly an idiot.  Sometimes the impression goes over so well, and then you actually see the person doing it,  or maybe even on television you'll see him, and realize, wow, I really don't sound like  the guy.  So why is this working? 
[03:02:00]  Why does this impression work?  You tap into something that the audience thinks about the person, you know, absolutely.  It's pretty odd.  Shatner was a cool person to meet, like the first time I met him.  Oh, yeah.  A funny guy, and just sitting there, he was talking about a talk show or one of the projects  that he had, and I would not stop, because I've been a Star Trek geek my entire life,  and I wouldn't stop just pounding him with questions, like very detailed questions.  On episodes, no matter what he would say, he got so fucking annoyed with me. 
[03:02:30]  But that's the sketch.  But it was funny, yeah.  Of course.  It was great.  It was like really a lot of fun.  He was annoyed.  Because he'd talk about something, and I'd be like, just like when you went to Rigel 7,  and he's like, oh my God.  And he was just like, I don't remember these things.  He was mad at me, he's like, I don't remember these things.  He was mad because you had more knowledge than he did.  Yeah.  On his own show.  He genuinely didn't care.  Right, yeah, I think he was just like, get out of here.  He did not give a shit about that.  And I was like, you know, the Rathacon, the emotion that came out between  you and Spock and the, because I don't care, it was a peach yet. 
[03:03:00]  It was just, but it was very fun, and had a great sense of humor about it.  That was the turning point in his career when he went on Saturday Night Live.  And did that.  And did that moment.  Get a life, yeah.  Yeah, you people, get a life.  Yeah, that was it.  Because you're like, wow, he's in on the joke finally.  Yeah, yeah, finally in on the joke.  Yeah.  How was, I heard Tom Cruise says something about when Nicholson,  when they did fucking The Few Good Men, everybody was kind of,  like, when he came on the set, even other actors were kind of odd that he was around.  Yeah, it was, well, I expected him to be aloof. 
[03:03:30]  I figured if you're that cool to four different generations,  you'll have people talk about you, not to you.  But the opposite was true.  He was actually a screwball and a fuck-off, which was hilarious.  No one expected it.  Like, one of the things, the stories I tell is that when he's on the stand in that scene, right,  in the courtroom there, the director said, action, he never missed a syllable.  It was unbelievable.  Wow.  But as soon as the director said, cut, he looked like he'd been stoned for three days. 
[03:04:00]  I swear to you, I'd never seen an actor turn it on and off like that, you know?  Action.  You need me on that wall.  You want me on that wall.  Cut.  Robbie.  Where do I sit?  Yeah, it's just, holy shit, but you're right.  When he walked on the set, every sphincter tightened.  It was, holy shit, there's the man.  And also, while we were shooting that,  Matcha Johnson was reported HIV positive during the production of A Few Good Men. 
[03:04:30]  So, of course, everyone goes to Jack, Mr. Laker, and says,  what the fuck does this mean, you know?  And Jack would just sit back, and he was so fucking sad.  I mean, it really crushed him.  It was like, hookers, it's all hookers.  Get off the plane, there's three waiting in the room.  It's a miracle it never happened before.  Oh, shit.  It's like, holy shit.  That's a fucking good Nicholson, man.  That's a great.  That's a real Nicholson.  That's not the fucking hack.  Over the top. 
[03:05:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's it.  Wow, that's a conversation on Nicholson.  It was those quiet moments that really freaked me out.  I thought, he's being Nicholson.  I mean, he's being a guy.  Yeah, it blew my shit away.  That must, especially starting out as a comic, when you meet these people, it's got to be just...  Well, yeah, and the problem is, I've been doing them in my act, so when I'm working on the movie,  all my friends, they didn't understand that I was having this ridiculously amazing opportunity experience,  like being brought up to the majors.  That's how I refer to that movie. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, yeah.  But my friends, all they were saying on the phone was,  did you do Jack for Jack?  You've got to do it for him.  You've got to do it for him.  You're going to love it.  You're going to love it.  My friends are dickheads.  Yeah, they're idiots.  Of course I'm not going to do Jack.  What, I'm going to be the one millionth dumbass in Nicholson's face saying,  this is what you sound like.  Imagine how many times he's seen that in front of his face.  It's like, all right, another one.  I would never...  When I'm around somebody that huge, like you mentioned, Casino, same thing with De Niro. 
[03:06:00]  When I'm around somebody that Mount Rushmore, I don't even talk to them.  If they want to say something, I'd love to chat, but I'm not going to engage them for the fear  they're going to go, who get this prick away from me?  You know, I don't...  Bob was a nice guy, though.  De Niro, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, very shy.  Very shy.  Jimmy does it De Niro, by the way.  Oh, nice.  It's a really...  It's dead on.  Nice.  But it's not De Niro for many movies or anything.  It's the real De Niro, like if you see him at an event or when he doesn't have a script. 
[03:06:30]  When he's trying to talk publicly and he's just trying to...  His horrendous public speaking ability, when he's trying to tie in something.  Like, what do you say?  Like, if you're from New York, you know, I rage.  I'm still breathing.  It's so awkward in public.  I'm just like him.  It's just horrendous and everybody's uncomfortable.  I'm really uncomfortable.  That is perfect.  That really is perfect.  You have to get...  Those are the things...  You have to get the little crazy nuances about these people. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, yeah.  To me, that's not...  Like, Carvey was always amazing about fighting the one little fucked up thing with George  Sr., not that, you know, that little screwed up little key.  Yeah, and it didn't have to...  The voice didn't have to be the voice.  It was just that little idiosyncrasy.  I remember being on the phone with him when he was doing the show and he said, I got to  do Ross Perot this Saturday.  And I said, what?  What are you going to fucking do?  He said, I don't know.  They gave me some tapes of him on Larry King I'm supposed to watch.  You know, no one had ever tried to do Ross at that point. 
[03:07:30]  And he said, I'm going to watch these tapes.  So we're talking on the phone.  And by the end of the call, we both have an amazing Ross Perot impression.  And I said, this is fucked.  You're going to become famous for doing Ross Perot on Saturday.  And I'm just a dickwad doing your act.  You know what I mean?  That's the screwy thing about doing those movies.  What's the best impression of any...  Like, what is your favorite impression of anybody?  To hear someone else do it?  Yeah, yeah, that somebody does.  Like, I think mine might be...  And the best one he enjoys doing it. 
[03:08:00]  My favorite one to hear might be Jay doing Colin.  Because it's such a weird one.  And I know Colin so well.  That's extraordinary.  That's an odd one to do.  That's a flawless, creepy thing.  I can tell.  Yeah.  I can tell it's ridiculous.  And when he put Colin Quinn in Reservoir Dogs, that was just fucking brilliant.  But his thinking changes when he does Colin.  Like, he starts to think like Colin.  Think like Colin.  That is the screwy thing.  If you go Deep Space Nine with these...  Yeah.  When I do Albert Brooks, I think faster and funnier than I do as myself. 
[03:08:30]  It's true.  There's a possession weird thing that actually happens.  You just live like him.  Is it me?  Am I crazy?  I'm going to go lie down.  Here's the thing.  Oh, my God.  Nemo.  I've got to stop saying it.  But I would say, yeah, his Colin Quinn is sick, crazy, ridiculous.  And it is one of those ones that is, oh, it gets creepy funny.  Yeah.  And then Dave Couillet's Pesci is fucking ridiculous.  Really?  And his Super Dave Osborne is sick, ridiculous. 
[03:09:00]  It's hard to find people that do a good Pesci.  Like, you see a lot of the over-the-top ones that just yell stutter and prick 50 times.  But you find a guy who really captures her.  Stutter and prick.  Yeah.  You're like, I want to hear JFK Pesci.  That's who I want to fucking hear.  That's who I want to hear.  That's the creepy.  Describe your neck in the wig.  Go.  Growing up, you were kind of a minor bird watching television all the time and doing imitations.  The first one, I think, whenever Columbo was first on, you know, I would just try to 
[03:09:30]  make my mom laugh by crossing my eyes and saying, I'm sorry.  Am I bothering you?  What's the problem?  And then I did that on Carson.  And I ran into Peter Falker, like, in a grocery store in L.A.  And he said, how do you do that with your eyes?  Me, I understand.  But how do you do that?  Plays great on radio.  Moving the one eye.  But I taught Carson to do, my next time on, I taught him how to cross just one eye, you  know, because he was kind of fascinated by it. 
[03:10:00]  And I said, in the pre-interview, they said, can you teach Johnny how to do the eyes?  I said, yeah, shut up.  So, but then how about this?  This is what really, to me, typifies why Carson can never be replaced and why.  You're talking about Carson Daly, right?  I am.  Please.  I thought that was fairly obvious.  You mentioned talk show host.  Legendary Carson Daly.  Of course.  Can't be replaced.  You think of Carson Daly, for sure.  So he, that's hilarious.  So I taught him to do the Columbus thing, right? 
[03:10:30]  And then whenever he brought me on to do the show, probably another 20 times before I retired,  over.  Jeez, how many Chinese did you do not take up your story?  A couple dozen.  Fuck, man.  Well, because he liked impressions.  He liked impressions.  He did them himself.  And it was like, like a parlor trick kind of thing to him.  Oh, that's great.  Yeah.  And so he, he would introduce the guests that come out from his left and you would pass  in front of his desk.  And for a second, you'd have your back to the audience.  Well, he stood at his desk, unlike Leno, who dances out behind the desk.  Hey, how's it going?  I'll give you a little shit. 
[03:11:00]  The king would stay at his throne, you know, and you would pass in front of him and lean  over sometimes and shake his hand on your way to the seat on his right.  And so in that little three second moment where your back is to the audience, I'm saying  every time I did the show, after that first time I taught him how to do the eye, he would  lean over the desk, cross his eyes and say, I'm sorry to bother you.  And it took me years to realize what he was doing in that moment was making me feel like  a million dollars as I'm sitting down in arguably the most nerve wracking situation of the year.  How fucking genius is that though? 
[03:11:30]  Seriously.  Did you finally just go, all right, I get it.  Towards the end they said, you've got to bust Johnny's chops a little, because you've  been on enough now, now you're comfortable, he's comfortable, you've got to do Carson for  Carson.  And I said, you can go fuck yourself.  That is never going to happen, ever.  That would have to be a tense moment.  There's a little too much reverence there.  Yeah, yeah.  You know what his genius was, Carson?  I'm sorry to interrupt you, but before you go, Carson, was that you never realized that  he had been pre-informed? 
[03:12:00]  Because he would say something like, I understand you were in Aruba, and I never once thought,  how the fuck would he know that?  That fucking set up for a stupid story that they did through a phone fucking pre-interview?  Never once did I understand that that's what had happened.  That's how great he was at that.  Yeah, he would often, now somebody told me, he would often say that.  And that was the only time I fucked with him was one time on the show he said, now somebody  told me, and I said, who told you?  Never mind.  I did have that moment.  I did get that.  That was a perfect head movement. 
[03:12:30]  Never mind.  That was exactly a great Johnny head movement.  Yeah, never mind.  He did have that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It is.  And the only experience I ever had like that was that time with Dice.  Yeah.  When we first met Dice, and I had done a Dice impression for years.  And he actually.  Well, that's why he was on the show, because he heard how great Ants Dice were.  That's how we connected.  He actually started, I was getting on him, you know, hey, jerk off face, I don't need  this garbage from you. 
[03:13:00]  And he sat there and he goes, he actually said to me, he goes, I'm not going to argue  with me.  That's fantastic having Dice say that to you.  I'm not going to argue with me.  He also said, you do me better than me.  Yeah, yeah.  Something like that.  You do me better than I do me.  Something like that, yeah.  You do.  I mean, then you get the certain rhythms.  And it becomes like, because the person, sometimes they'll drift away from the core.  Yeah, yeah.  And the impression is just the core.  You'll have to, yeah.  It's almost like you kind of got to make a face and body movements to actually get it 
[03:13:30]  down.  And sometimes I've picked up an impression by not ripping somebody off, but you can  listen to the actual person and not be able to get it.  Yeah.  And then if you see someone else do an impression for a second, you're like, ah, that's how  you do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's a weird thing.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You learned, we're totally geeking out on impressions.  Yeah.  This is awesome.  What's the one you're most proud of that you're like, not necessarily has to be your  best, but the one you're like, I picked out this trait that I'm so happy.  Oh, that no one else probably did, yeah. 
[03:14:00]  Is there a trait you picked out of somebody that...  The only one I do, I think, that I've never heard anyone else do is Alan Arkin.  Wow.  And so that's the sort of offbeat, weird one that people are like, why would you do that?  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  Does that work in Kansas City when you do Alan Arkin?  Who Arkin?  Yeah.  Alan Barkin?  Exactly.  I want to hear Alan Arkin.  Alan, Alan?  Yeah, Alan Barkin.  I don't understand.  There's royal people, and they're waiting.  She's got flowers.  Who is this girl?  That's so good.  That's so funny. 
[03:14:30]  Oh, that's good.  By the way, I don't understand the uniform.  Has he ever held a gun in his life?  Why is he dressed up like a general?  This is very strange to me.  That's awesome.  This kid from...  God damn.  Wow.  Oh, that's great.  Absolutely.  Well, I never heard...  But it's a little nuanced.  I never heard anybody, though, do Shatner.  Like, everyone now does your version of Shatner.  Well, yeah.  With the over-pronounced, dramatic pauses and the throwing himself into...  First of all, can you believe he turned 81?  I know.  When you see him, he looks great. 
[03:15:00]  He's...  It's...  I mean, we should all be kicking life in the sack that hard at 81.  Yeah.  He's truly unbelievable.  I mean, he's blown up like a poisoned dog.  Don't get me wrong.  He'll say Jerry Lewis.  By the way, if you can't eat carbs when you're 80, fuck life.  You know what I'm saying?  You might as well.  When I get to...  If I get to 81, I'm going to just...  I'll have the pie.  I'll have the pie and a glass of...  Of course.  Of course.  Or a pie.  Of course.  Jimmy does a great...  Another great impression.  You want to do your Alan Alda for Kettle and Pollock?  I don't want to push her on the spot. 
[03:15:30]  Two masters going back in front.  Amy, can you talk Jimmy into it?  I love a good Alan Alda.  All right.  He loves Alan Alda.  This is amazing.  Close your eyes for that.  It's short.  All right.  Yes.  That's right.  No, no.  Come on.  Come on.  Jimmy.  Jimmy.  He was in the room.  That's why he got the big show in Seattle.  He was here.  That was more Woody Allen-ish.  He was in the room.  Oh, that was great.  And to Social Seattle, let's not forget it.  Oh, yeah.  Tickets on sale today, by the way, at 10 o'clock Seattle time for myself, Brewer, Attel, and Bill 
[03:16:00]  Bird, July the 1st, that will sell out because B.J. Shea is promoting it.  And Kevin also, by the way, if you're in New York, he's going to be at Caroline's tonight  and tomorrow, two shows each night, 212-757-4100.  Kevin is great, man.  Oh, yeah.  Really, really funny dude.  Oh, thanks, man.  And it's funny.  I knew you as an actor.  I mean, we haven't met before, but I knew who you were as an actor before I even knew  you were a comic many, many years ago, which is a real sign of respect. 
[03:16:30]  Like, Rod Reyes, his brother was Rick Avilis, who was in Ghost and he died of AIDS, and he  was a drug user, and I don't know why I had to throw that in just to prove that I knew  something about him.  But he was a comic, and I didn't even know he was a comic.  And he's like, man, that would have made Rick so happy that somebody thought he was  an actor before a comic.  Yeah, yeah.  And I said, all right, we're done talking.  Good timing.  Yeah.  It is kind of weird and great and amazing, and yet, you know, I definitely think of myself  as a comic first, without question.  I still feel like a poser when I'm on the set of a movie. 
[03:17:00]  I really do.  You feel like, ah, I shouldn't be here.  Yeah, I'm not kidding.  It's not pummel pie bullshit.  I keep waiting the first two weeks for somebody to tap me on the shoulder and say, we've made  a horrible look.  Yeah, we're on the end.  You really don't know what you're doing.  The good thing is, though, when I watch your movies, I don't think like, oh, there's  Kevin Pollack, the comic impressionist.  Because you really do pull it off.  I don't know how you bullshit these people.  I don't either.  You do pull it off.  It's amazing.  You know how it is?  For some comedians, I think you're more comfortable on stage than we are in life. 
[03:17:30]  You know, because you're in control or whatever the fuck it is.  I don't know.  But there's something about being comfortable in front of an audience.  And that's all it was when I got on set to do the first movie.  I was just comfortable in front of the camera.  Nothing really about that bothered me or tripped me out or anything.  So that was it.  And then on A Few Good Men, there was a great character actor who passed away, J.T. Walsh.  Oh, yeah, man.  Fucking genius, right?  He was great.  And so he sees me doing the thing, and he starts telling me, you know, you're doing good work. 
[03:18:00]  And I said, I swear, I'm like confessional now.  I said, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, honestly.  This is like number eight for me, and I don't know if there's going to be a number nine.  And he said, no, what you're doing is actually a technique called less is more.  You know, you're just kind of throwing it away, which is, that's the best stuff.  When you don't, you never get caught acting that way.  That's what we do every day on this show.  Right?  Yeah.  Less is a lot more.  Every day.  Phone that fuck.  You're right in.  But it's the, you know, it's, you get out of your own way kind of bullshit. 
[03:18:30]  That's all.  I don't know if you ever played golf or anything.  It's like the harder you try, the worse you fucking are.  It's the same thing.  When you finally decide after the first hole to say, fuck it.  Yes.  I'll have a beer instead.  Son of a bitch, I suck at this game.  You know what my favorite thing in casino was?  It was an odd thing that Sharon Stone did.  Her fucking, I'm a loud, drunken whore run.  Yes.  That run she did when she was wobble walk running was the fucking greatest wobble.  What?  It's the fucking best work.  Be careful.  I've been there.  Be careful. 
[03:19:00]  That line is great.  Be careful.  Yeah.  It's trying to make like everything school.  Best work by a million miles for her.  Wow, was she a great match?  By a million miles.  Really good.  Yeah, that's the whole movie.  And those are the movies that it doesn't matter.  You're going through the channels, bump, it's on, the remote goes right on the couch,  and you're watching no matter where you come in on it.  Pack a lunch.  It's not a short film.  And the soundtrack is un-fucking-believable.  Yeah.  Again, he's so great at that.  The first, like, 45 minutes with the double voiceover between Pesci and Canero. 
[03:19:30]  Oh, yeah.  That's fantastic, man.  Sick, crazy, as they tell you how they made Vegas.  Oh, fuck.  And it doesn't seem like a forced, okay, we've got to spoon-feed the audience with the voiceover.  Yeah, the exposition.  It's very natural.  My favorite part.  We're actually selling that Casino was a good movie.  Wow, we're really out on a limb here.  You guys discovered it.  It's like an indie film that we found.  We like discovering new things.  We pass it along to the audience.  You're here to promote Casino, right?  Yeah. 
[03:20:00]  I hope it does well.  I just want people to get a chance to see it.  I'm a bunch of assholes.  I've got to tell you, watching Rickles, watching Don Rickles rip into De Niro on the set was  maybe one of my favorite moments in my history of show business.  We love Rickles.  Well, first of all, Rickles tells me that he found out that De Niro kind of, ever since  he was a kid, was in like a put-down group on the street corners growing up.  Your mother this, your mother that.  And to them, Rickles was God.  So Rickles tells me he knows that De Niro worships him, basically. 
[03:20:30]  So Rickles, of course, Rickles just can't wait to get on the set in front of everyone.  So I'm telling you, in the middle of a take, we're on the casino floor standing in front  of each other, and De Niro is saying his dialogue.  Cameras rolling, Scorsese's watching, hundreds of extras on the casino floor.  De Niro is speaking his dialogue.  In the middle of it, Rickles would say, is that it?  Is that how you're going to do it?  Like that?  No, no, you got the awards.  I'm sure you know what you're doing.  Get it.  And De Niro is weeping with laughter. 
[03:21:00]  You can't fucking believe how hilarious this is.  I mean, just literally, like crying with that big De Niro face.  And just every chance he got, there was another big scene where Alan King's character presents  my character with a giant mock-up check, 60-something million to build a casino, right?  So there's these deus tables and a little podium, and I'm sitting there, and Rickles and Alan  King, and we're waiting for De Niro to join us to shoot the shot, and there's like 100 
[03:21:30]  extras portraying the press corps that are capturing this moment, and they're standing  around, milling around while we're waiting.  Well, Rickles has got a captive audience, so he starts hammering these extras.  What do you make, $40 a day and bad fish on a truck?  Good for you.  And he's just hammering them, and they're loving it, and everybody's laughing.  If he goes off for maybe 15 minutes, and finally he settles down into the chair, and  he's just sitting there for a second, and just then De Niro walks on the set, and  Rickles lunges back at the microphone, pointing at the extras, saying, all right, which one  of you said he's gay?  He's him now! 
[03:22:00]  And again, De Niro just stops, makes the face, and he's laughing like a fucking child.  It was sick incredible.  Is there a line that Rickles had about him?  Because he was talking about how boring De Niro was.  He was fucking with him, and he said, I watched a fly die on his face.  Is that Rickles' line?  Yeah, that sounds right.  Pesci did not like it, by the way.  Really?  No, didn't care for it.  Because Rickles would literally go after him in front of 300 extras, you know, and it  was just too...  He said to... 
[03:22:30]  I think he said to Pesci, he was so short that he was going to ride him around the set  like a Shetland pony.  Yeah, I can see how he probably wouldn't like that.  And Pesci just did not smile, and said, yeah, yeah, no, I get it, I'm a midget, and you're  a genius, go fuck yourself.  But I mean, he was serious, he wasn't going for...  Oh, God, that was odd, that was a quiet moment.  Holy shit.  Wow, why didn't he...  How would you...  Exactly.  How do you not feel...  It's Rickles, all he does is attack people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a tremendous... 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Hanging out with him probably was my favorite part of the whole experience, to be honest  with you.  Amazing.  Rickles, because you talk about Mount Rushmore, forget it, that's it.  Was he thrown by Pesci's snubbery, didn't give a fuck?  Oh, no, he kept going after him.  Yeah, you could just tell him about that point.  The more Joe fought it, the harder he came after him.  You know what, if you're not afraid to attack Sinatra in the fucking late 50s and early  60s, you don't care about Pesci.  Yeah.  He really didn't...  We played on the...  I loved his fucking going after Reagan at the inaugural... 
[03:23:30]  Oh, that's genius.  My favorite, too.  There's never been a harder audience than 10,000 people at Reagan's inauguration, and  he went out, and he murdered.  Yes.  Yeah, he's as fearless, I believe, as any comedian's ever been in history.  I really do.  I really do.  We all talk shit, but he would do it to Sinatra when the mob was in the...  It could just absolutely...  Yeah, making mob jokes.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  It's amazing, man.  Is he looking?  He would always say, look.  Is he looking over here?  Alan King was great, too.  Yeah, well, not to Rickles. 
[03:24:00]  Rickles did not suffer Alan King well at all.  Really?  What do you mean?  Well, he would just say, did he mention the Kennedys?  He would just go after him, like, oh, he's pals with him.  He's hanging out at Kenny Buckport, this kid.  Yeah.  He really went after him.  Alan King?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  You could tell there was like an old rivalry or something between him.  Something going on there.  Yeah, it was cool.  Old school.  It was actually cool.  Yeah.  Because we all went out to dinner, and Rickles was just put out the whole time.  It was hilarious.  Wow.  Damn.  De Niro loved being teased.  Loved it.  Everybody?  Because he loved Rickles more than God.  It was unbelievable.  I mean, Rickles was right. 
[03:24:30]  He had worshipped him his whole life, which is a bizarre connection.  That is kind of odd.  You never connect those dots, but apparently De Niro told someone, he said, you don't understand,  when I was a kid, you know, this was a guy, and they would hang out on the street corner,  and it was either a doo-wop group or a put-down group.  Those were the two peer groups in De Niro's day, and one was, you know, singing songs,  the other one was your mother this, your mother that.  And so Rickles was everything to them.  So to be attacked by the king made him the happiest guy on the planet.  And he would put his arm around Don like his own father. 
[03:25:00]  It was really cool.  And nobody ever, a guy like De Niro never gets teased in front of people.  I'm telling you, every sphincter titans, nobody says, there he is, there he is.  That's all people say.  He's legendary, yeah.  It was like literally the single, number one on the list of who should Rickles not attack.  That's what everyone's thinking, and then there he goes.  Then again, after you've gone after Sinatra and Reagan, it really, what do you do after  that to fucking impress on Rickles?  There's no one you can't go after.  It's probably, it's probably like a fresh catch for Rickles. 
[03:25:30]  You know, it's like, how do I top myself?  Yeah.  I'll go after De Niro.  And he can, and he's like one of the only people that could get away with saying anything  to anybody.  So again, if you get a chance, see Casino.  Yes.  And Rickles, Rickles is going to Stardust, September 11th through the 17th.  But he would brutalize Carson on Carson.  He would brutalize him.  Oh, yeah.  And Ed, brutalize him.  No one did that.  No one attacked Reynolds or Burt Reynolds when he was on fucking, and I love watching  those old fucking clips. 
[03:26:00]  I watched the old clips of Carson.  I wound up buying one of those sets.  They're amazing to watch.  The guys out there smoking, drinking, like Dean Martin had come and sit down, and they're  just drinking and smoking out there.  It's like, no one can do that anymore.  Yeah, yeah.  It's pretty great.  What do the children think?  Who gives a shit?  These guys didn't care.  No, they really didn't.  No.  You also have a very well-put-together podcast.  Oh, thanks, man.  Thanks.  It's on Ustream, I think you're on, right?  Yeah.  We go live every Sunday, and it's long-form, one-on-one kind of Charlie Rose with a sense 
[03:26:30]  of humor.  It's great.  It looks really good and sounds good, because, I mean, out of 10,000 webcasts, you can get  maybe one that looks and sounds good.  Fuck the content.  I'm just saying, something that doesn't look like a 1995 webcam.  Yeah.  You know, so, man, I've checked out a few episodes, and it's really well done.  Oh, thanks.  And search it out on Ustream.  Yeah, that's really good. 
[03:27:00]  Any movies coming up?  Well, there's Red State, of course, and then another one, a big, stupid studio comedy,  but it's got pretty good.  It's Steve Martin, Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and Rashida Jones, and Angelica Houston, Diane  Weiss, Joel McHale.  They couldn't get anybody.  Jesus Christ.  And the same guy that directed Devil Wears Prada, and so it's called The Big Year,  and that's about the exciting world of bird watching.  Oh, yeah, I heard about that. 
[03:27:30]  It sounds awesome.  See, it's funny already.  The exciting world.  You've heard of this, Amy?  Yeah, Steve Martin did my, oh, I should have said that.  Steve Martin did my Fuse show, and he was talking about how he did that movie, and he said it  was awesome.  He's like, you know, a big bluegrass guy.  Huge.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just, the strangest thing that ever happened, I ended up playing Carnegie Hall because  of Steve Martin was doing this James Taylor 120th year anniversary show.  Yeah.  And, you know, Steve was talking to his old friend James, and James said he wanted to do  something, some kind of tribute to Lenny Bruce, because, again, it was the 120th anniversary 
[03:28:00]  of Carnegie Hall.  And also, I get this email from Steve Martin saying, because we just did the movie, we  don't really hang out or anything.  He just, you know, sort of reached out.  It was fucking incredible.  Larry King1 at AOL.com.  And so he says, I talked to James Taylor, and he's looking to do something for Lenny Bruce,  and I told him, you could probably impersonate Lenny if he wanted that.  So, good luck if he calls you.  And it's one of those things, like, every actor, when you meet with a director, the old 
[03:28:30]  joke is, if the director says, can you ride a horse, you say, hell yeah.  Yes, I have a saddle in my trunk.  Yeah, what do you need?  So, sure enough, fucking James Taylor calls.  I instantly shit myself, and he says, so, man, can you do this thing?  And I'm like, of course, are you kidding?  Shit.  I've been doing Lenny for 30 years.  I had never done Lenny Bruce.  I hadn't even thought about doing Lenny Bruce.  There's almost no video of him, because they wanted to do it from the early days, not the  later days, when he hated everything and was hanging on the microphone. 
[03:29:00]  I made a point of not watching Dustin Hoffman, because that was ridiculous.  So, I, you know, I was like, how the fuck, and there's two appearances of him on Steve  Allen's show.  I just memorized that.  But, Steve Martin was there, as you said, doing his banjo stuff.  Yeah.  Paying tribute to Skuggs and the other guy.  Flat.  Yes.  Nice pull.  Thank you.  Who created the five-finger pick.  Yeah.  Hillbillies theme song.  There you go.  Look at that.  Flat and screwed.  Wow.  Yeah, it's great.  I watched a lot of television. 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, I guess so.  Yeah, his band is amazing.  And in between the banjo, you have to tune after every song, so he does stand-up in between  each song, and it was hilarious, his stand-up.  He's hilarious without even trying this guy.  It's ridiculous.  He was like, what did he say?  He was tuning his banjo, and he's like, I only write songs about things I care about.  So, this next song's called Minimum Wage.  Let's keep her right where she's at.  Oh, he yelled at me.  Yeah, no, his stand-up is crazy hip. 
[03:30:00]  And, yeah, same thing between the songs.  He shocks the hell out of you.  Bird-watching.  Yeah, right?  The exciting world.  It's funny, the only bird-watching movie I ever really enjoyed was The Woodsman.  Oh, my God.  Just dance.  Okay.  What a fag.  Let's go again.  Today, I saw a parrot.  Anyone else?  Yellow-bellied sapsucker.  Oh, man.  I think it's well time to wrap this up. 
[03:30:30]  Fellas, let me just say, I'm a huge fan, and this was a thrill for you.  Please.  It's been a long time, and I miss doing the show and seeing you, and I'm a huge, huge fan.  Well, let's do it again.  Yeah, absolutely.  In fact, I can't believe I didn't bring up the, you guys were talking about Independence Day three or four weeks ago.  Oh, my God.  And I had been ragging on Hirsch, how he sent my people back 50 fucking years.  Oh, it was horrible.  Hawking the president for a cracker on Air Force One, and you guys were going after him.  I'm going, this is it.  Look at this.  Yeah.  You'd all be dead if it wasn't for my son, David. 
[03:31:00]  Right.  What is this?  Jeez.  I couldn't believe you were hawking.  It was beautiful.  They didn't want to harp on the fact he was building a settlement on Air Force One.  We get it, Judd.  Anyways, this was a thrill for me.  Well, thank you, man.  That's for sure.  Caroline's tonight and tomorrow.  Yes.  Kevin Pollack, 212-757-4100.  It's going to kill, obviously.  If you're in the area, go to Caroline's.  If you get a chance, go to Caroline's.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Casino.  It's opening Friday.  Next Friday, it's great. 
[03:31:30]  And Shuma.  And Amy's.  Amy.  The very, very funny Amy Shuma.  And lovely.  And lovely, of course.  Yeah, sexy.  But it doesn't matter on iTunes.  It's all funny.  Vivacious.  It's called Cutting.  Beatable.  Molestable.  On iTunes.  Wrappable.  Wrappable, yes.  Very wrappable.  You can pick up a copy of Despicable.  And you can pick up Cutting.  Cutting is Amy's scene.  And we find out in the last track, I believe, why it's called Cutting.  I know what it means.  She really teased us like that.  And if you buy both Jimmy and my CD at the same time, we'll come to your house and fist you. 
[03:32:00]  That's right.  A bulk deal and a fist thing.  It's a great deal.  Even if you don't.  That's beautiful.  Just lock your doors.  Lock your doors.  Jimmy, what do you got, brother?  Just Seattle going on a sale today.  Myself, Attell Brewer, Bill Burr, July 1st.  I forget what theater it is, but just go to tickets.com.  And BJ Shea is sponsoring our show.  So I think that will sell very well.  It'll do.  Very good.  And we're on sale in D.C. May 13th.  Damn.  I think it's have a nice weekend time.  Let's do it.  The truth.  Thank you.  TGI.  Thank you, Kevin.  Thank you.  Thanks, Amy.
