<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy segment devoted to a Mary Tyler Moore reunion special, focusing heavily on Ted Knight's comedic performances.  The hosts used crude and offensive language to describe the aging appearances of Mary Tyler Moore and Valerie Harper.  Numerous audio clips of Ted Knight from various sources, including *Mary Tyler Moore*, *Caddyshack*, and a comedy album, were played, prompting further discussion of his comedic legacy and generating laughter.  Listeners were encouraged to submit additional Ted Knight clips.  The hosts also discussed other reunion specials and the negative impact of age and plastic surgery on celebrities.  Several callers contributed, some offering additional Ted Knight clips or observations, others engaging in unrelated tangents, including a caller sharing a funny anecdote about a *Mary Tyler Moore* episode involving Ted Knight's reaction to Georgette giving birth.  This was followed by a highly confrontational and offensive phone call with “Heather the Feather,” a stripper, filled with vulgarity, misogynistic remarks, and personal attacks from the hosts and callers. The call ended abruptly.

The show then shifted to a more loosely structured segment.  The hosts began by mocking strippers and their self-perception, before transitioning to their upcoming 2002 Celebrity Slash Bikini Softball game.  They discussed player selection, focusing heavily on the comedically disastrous past performance of Jay Moore and praising the skills of guest Jim Brewer, who was present in the studio.  Extensive ribbing of other players ensued.  A significant portion of this segment detailed updates on “Stalker Patty,” a listener who had recently become homeless after being evicted from the studio following a “Money Snatch” contest.  The hosts discussed her experiences in a women’s shelter, described as frightening and unsafe, and her subsequent temporary housing with a listener.  Graphic descriptions of the shelter and offensive comments were made by the hosts and callers.  Patty's troubled past and difficult life circumstances were also discussed.  The segment concluded with the hosts detailing their tedious process of recording commercial "hot wire" reads, highlighting their laziness and conflicts with production staff. Calls from Rich Voss, discussing his participation in the softball game, and several offensive calls on the F.U. line, were also featured.

A caller named Eddie then dominated a substantial portion of the broadcast. He calmly and casually recounted a 1977 double murder of two Colombian drug dealers, detailing the shooting, burning of bodies in a New Jersey swamp, and disposal of remains in New York City.  He claimed he had never been caught.  He spoke extensively with the hosts and a female caller, Patty, who was considering moving in with him.  A police officer briefly called in before the call ended, and the hosts, while expressing disbelief, didn't directly challenge Eddie’s confession.  The conversation included discussions about the murder weapon, Eddie’s current life, and his interactions with law enforcement. Patty, initially apprehensive, appeared less concerned as the call progressed. The segment concluded with plans for Patty to move in with Eddie, despite his confessed double murder.

Finally, another segment featured a call with Eddie, this time detailing the burning of a car belonging to Colombians using a knife, Brillo pad, and rubbing alcohol. He also mentioned removing the license plates, suggesting the car was likely considered stolen and unrelated to a later murder. The hosts and Eddie joked about the incident. The conversation then shifted back to Stalker Patty and the hosts' plan to send Billy Staples, a security professional, to Eddie's house to "protect" her.  The hosts joked about Billy, who had previously spent the night at Eddie’s house, wearing shirts from both their shows, and other humorous scenarios involving Sylvester Stallone movies. The segment concluded with promotion of the Ron and Fez show, implying a connection to the earlier discussions about Eddie’s confession and Stalker Patty's safety.  The show ended with a brief mention of upcoming segments about a softball game and a news story about violent video games.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Marijuana is the bomb.  Hi.  I don't know. I don't even know what I'm doing here.  It's what I do. It's all I do.  I think that I don't like it. 
[00:00:30]  You stupid faggot.  Before we get through this, we just got to keep your chin up.  Just got to keep your chin up.  We're going to turn this thing around.  I'll turn this thing around.  Well, let's just stick with me.  That's when we'll turn this thing around.  How you guys doing?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It depressed me playing Tom Clips.  I know. 
[00:01:00]  I feel bad.  If you weren't listening last week, Tom got fired.  How about a pesky?  Okay.  Okay, pookie.  Okay, pookie.  Give me the other one, man.  Well, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027. 
[00:01:30]  Anywhere else?  Outside of New York, 866-2774.  Wow.  We're walking around talking like Ted Knight for hours.  Yeah, they did that Mary Tyler Moore reunion show last night.  And you know what?  It wasn't that bad.  No.  I was hoping to see some people that are really, really old and out of touch and stuff.  Besides Georgette, it really wasn't that bad.  Are you my pal?  Are you my pal?  This calls for the old Billy Baroo. 
[00:02:00]  Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy, Billy.  Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy.  This is a bee.  The bee.  Don't let me down, Billy.  38,000.  Stop.  Stop.  Stop.  Quite possibly the funniest man ever to breathe.  Right.  Ted Knight.  Yeah, we're on a Ted Knight kick.  We've got to find as many Ted Knight clips as possible. 
[00:02:30]  Maybe our listeners can help us and email them in to us because we were watching the Mary Tyler Moore thing.  It was pretty much a waste of time is what I was going to say.  But every time Ted Knight was on the TV last night.  Gold.  Just freaking hilarious moment after hilarious moment.  I was saying I could watch an entire special on Mary Tyler Moore if it was just Ted Knight clips.  Okay.  Lou, I like a meeting with the entire staff.  He's just the funniest, goofiest ass. 
[00:03:00]  And he's standing out there, and now the news.  He's getting everything wrong.  Very funny, man.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  Who?  And then they bring out Georgette.  Oh.  Now, most of the other broads on the show, we've got Mary.  She's had a lot of work done.  One more facelift, and she'll have a goatee.  I consider people that are, you ever look at people, they're entirely different beings than they were. 
[00:03:30]  Some people, they get older.  You remember them from movies or TV shows from years ago.  Yet, they are still the same person.  You still look at them as the same person.  There are other people that just are complete different entities now.  Ravaged by time.  She has time or surgery.  And Mary Tyler Moore is one of those.  It's like, yeah, well, that's Mary Tyler Moore, yeah, but it's not that Mary Tyler Moore, you know?  Yeah.  So she looks like they just, like, pulled her face back. 
[00:04:00]  She looks like the Joker.  Yeah.  She was crying at one point at the end of the show, getting a little teared up, and I'm thinking,  that must happen all the time.  Our tear ducts are probably squished with the skin that's being pulled around our eyes.  The tears actually come from her cheeks now.  Is that where it is?  They pulled down to get the pants away?  She cries from her cheeks.  Your cheeks are running, Mary.  Mary.  Mary.  What a shame.  He's the one that's dead.  No F.  Oh, my God.  Why not Gavin McCloud? 
[00:04:30]  He was pretty funny.  Yeah, but if you're going to pick someone to die, come on.  Georgette.  Georgette.  Who looks like an old, retarded lady.  You know, and I'm expecting her to get on and start, you know, well, Mary, you know,  I had to play a person that was a little simple-minded, but she's like,  I had such a good time.  It was the happiest moment of my life, Mary.  I saw things in Ted that no one else saw.  I'm freaking retarded.  I haven't had a job in showbiz since the show, Mary, so thanks for inviting me back tonight. 
[00:05:00]  I was always amazed that Mary would even talk to me.  I looked up to her, and Mary took Georgette under her wing.  You're talking about yourself.  You didn't even act.  It's apparent you didn't even have to act.  You're a retard.  Now she's a big, fat retard.  She was such a little rail.  Mary, I'm just bummed that me and Ted and I never had sex during all those years working together. 
[00:05:30]  Georgette, do you want to stroke it?  Okay.  I'm going to pull out the old Billy Beru for you, Georgette.  You spit at me, Ted.  That's what it does.  Pookie.  Okay.  She was an actual retard.  By the way, drink bastards, that was my Georgette.  There you go.  And it was pretty damn good.  All the other women on the show, though, like Mary, you know, and then you got that Chloris Leachman. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah.  Aside from the attractive name, she kind of looks the same, older, same entity.  Betty White was pretty old on the show.  They didn't look that bad.  She held together.  They did these reunion shows with Laverne and Shirley.  What a mess those people look like.  And then they did it with the Carol Burnett show.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  But Georgette was the one that, you know, I guess she's been eating whatever royalty money 
[00:06:30]  she gets from TV land.  They showed a profile where she's got a big gullet under her chin, you know, like Pelican  where they put the fish.  This is where I store my fish, Mary.  Mary, Mary, anyway.  You're going to take it in the back door tonight, Georgette.  Roll over.  You know it hurts, Ted.  I don't care.  I'm a star anchor man.  I'm going to give it to you like in the days when I was on a 5,000-watt radio station in 
[00:07:00]  Fresno, California.  Could you call me Walter Cronkite when I bang you?  He was a genius.  He is, and he's got to be the dead one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was fun, though, but we're on another Ted Knight kick, so if you've got Ted Knight  clips, send them in.  Ted Knight.  We only have like five or six here.  We've got a few.  We've got his album.  We have that ridiculous album.  You know, any time you're popular in a TV show.  Matt and Huggy gave it to us. 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  The guys down there in Philly.  Especially back in those days, they would try to pimp you out in every fashion possible.  And Ted Knight, they made him put out a little comedy album.  It's sort of a singing, spoken word, dopey comedy album.  And you remember, are you going to play High Guy?  I don't know which, we don't have a track listing.  Well, Rick should know where High Guy is.  Remember back in the days when Mary Tyler Moore was on television?  Yeah, that's High Guy. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, this is High Guy?  Okay.  Is it track three, Rick?  Is that why he was holding up three fingers?  He does things and then runs away like that.  Yeah, yeah, I got it.  Okay, track three.  Back in those days, there was a commercial for, I guess, a razor or shaving cream.  And you'd open up your medicine cabinet.  On the commercial, the guy opened it up.  And there was another medicine cabinet on the other side where the guy would open it up and go,  Hi, Guy.  And it was like the catchphrase of 1974.  Hi, Guy.  You've got the most twisted memory. 
[00:08:30]  You remember everything.  I remember that.  I remember those commercials.  I don't remember the High Guy thing.  I was sitting there, Indian style, in front of the television, the old Zenith, big wide-eyed kid with the huge remote control.  Clink.  Hoping mommy and daddy wouldn't fight today.  Yeah.  Hoping daddy wouldn't throw that plate of spaghetti against the phone again.  I remember that one.  Traumatic.  Stuck in my head.  Mother F!  Wham!  Spaghetti on the phone.  Thanks, Hopi, for the memory. 
[00:09:00]  Hi, Guy.  Hi, Guy.  Wait, John wants in here.  John, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  Pretty good.  All right.  I don't have the tape, but the funniest thing, I laughed until I peed every time on that show,  is when Georgette had her baby and Ted was flipping out every five seconds.  And Lou had to carry Ted out of the room when she was having her baby.  We need those clips.  I know.  We'll gather up a bunch of Ted Knight clips because he was just the funniest guy.  Yeah.  So goddamn funny. 
[00:09:30]  All right, John, thank you.  Oh, they have a Ted Knight wave page.  Okay, let me see.  Some guys might be hooking us up.  Balloon Knot Joe, what's going on, man?  Guys, did you see Mary Tyler Moore's face these days?  She looks just like the frozen Hummer monkey.  Oh, God.  Get a picture and compare.  Hey, maybe Steve could do a little separate at birth thing on his website.  That would be fun.  Yeah, the monkey in a bag, the dead monkey in a bag from the Philly show.  If you haven't seen that picture yet, foundrymusic.com.  The link is off opieandanthony.com. 
[00:10:00]  You got some clips in or not?  I might if you turn that up.  We'll see where we are here.  All right.  Yeah, we'll play the song, too.  Are we ready?  Yeah, go ahead.  Okay.  Don't you have homes?  Well, that's one of my favorites.  Don't you have homes?  Caddyshack, when he walks in, don't you have homes?  You know, I'm bringing in.  There's a car parked illegally out front.  I want a towed away medium, medium.  You know what?  I'm bringing in my Caddyshack DVD, and we just got to get every Ted Knight clip. 
[00:10:30]  Every single one.  Go ahead.  That's the only one you got?  Yeah, people are sending them, you know, one by one.  All right.  Well, throughout the show, we'll throw in some Ted Knight stuff, okay?  Good old Ted.  Don't you have homes?  Don't you have homes?  Damn it.  Now I got to go watch that movie again.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, guys.  Hey, man.  Hey, man.  I thought Mary Tom Moore looked fantastic last night.  Really?  As a matter of fact, just to commemorate, I used some Ben Gay to folate myself there 
[00:11:00]  to toss one off instead of the traditional Vaseline.  You insane?  Why?  You really used Ben Gay to do that?  Yeah, why not?  Well, you know, she's pretty old.  I took out my Depends.  I wrapped it around myself.  I got the Ben Gay out, slapped it on the TV set.  It was wonderful.  Well, I hope you enjoyed it.  Thank you, Gary.  Opie, I think I have another Ted Knight clip from the Mary and Tyler Moore show.  Gary doing bits for us.  Yes.  Go ahead, Anthony.  All I've got are looks and a voice. 
[00:11:30]  All I've got are looks and a voice.  It rolls.  It does roll.  All right, you want to hear this high guy thing?  High guy.  It's awful.  Let's check this out.  Ted Knight's singing.  Oh, wacky music.  You stop at a bar for a couple of drinks.  You turn a lot of juice.  Two ladies give you a wink and a wave.  You walk into their noose.  Because when you ask their names, one says, 
[00:12:00]  I'm Percy, this is Bruce.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Are they fads?  Is that what I'm getting?  Is that your pad?  Your cozy and lamps.  A guy comes splintering right through your door with fists as big as hands.  You didn't know the girl was married to a tackle on the ramp.  Oh, ho.  Hi, guys. 
[00:12:30]  How's it going, guys?  Oh, this is awesome.  See you, guys.  All right, all right.  Do we have to hear the whole thing?  I don't think so.  You're out there taking an evening straw to catch your favorite sight.  That girl who puts her nightgown on her blinds drawn up at night.  You feel a hand on your shoulder.  You'll see a flashing light.  Ah, hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, poor Ted Knight.  Hi, guys.  Another Ted Knight clip.  All right, go ahead.  You're drinking too much, Your Excellency.  Excellency Fiddlesticks.  My name's Fred, and I'm just a man, same as you are.  You're not a man.  You're a bishop, for God's sakes.  There is no call.  Ah, that's great.  Screw doing the radio show today.  Let's just play Ted Knight clips all day.  Look at Ted Knight clips.  Huh? 
[00:13:30]  Here, you got another one.  You got another one?  How about a Fresca?  We got that one.  We got that one.  Try track two.  How about a Fresca?  What's track two?  I'm not sure.  You're not sure?  More Ted Knight's singing.  I want to hear a cover.  I was a lad in a fishing town.  An old man said to me,  You can spend your life, your jolly, jolly life,  just sailing on the sea.  Yeah.  You can search the world for pretty girls. 
[00:14:00]  Your eyes are weak and dim.  Picture him in the studio.  But don't go swimming with a mermaid, son,  if you don't know how to swim.  Oh, God.  Enough of that.  Another clip.  Another clip.  I bet you slice into the woods a hundred bucks.  Gambling is illegal at Bushwood, sir,  and I never slice.  Dad!  Okay, you can open. 
[00:14:30]  I owe you nothing.  I owe you nothing.  What's the more funny Ted Knight clips, though?  Yeah.  I owe you nothing.  I owe you nothing.  Mike, you're on the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Don't kill me.  I'm surprised no one meant...  Hold on.  Don't kill us with that today, you bastards.  Hi, guys.  Hi, guys.  Go ahead, Mike.  I'm surprised no one mentioned Mary Tyler Moore, 
[00:15:00]  men in black,  when the bug crashes down  and possesses the farmer's body.  Yeah, yeah.  And the guy walks inside and pulls his face back  when his wife says it's crooked.  That's Mary Tyler Moore for you.  Ah.  Hey, very good observation.  Have a good day.  Thanks, Mike.  Speaking of celebrities that look like aliens,  did you see the picture of Al Pacino  in the paper today?  No.  Oh, my God.  Oh, bad.  He looks like the alien from Aliens.  Ah, let me see.  I don't know which paper it was in.  Do you remember, Ben? 
[00:15:30]  I think it was the post.  It was the post?  Here, give me the other one.  We'll get it real fast.  How about fast?  Yeah, and Michael Douglas' lovely wife  on the front page.  I got to show Ant this real fast.  Somebody just gave me a good side, too.  Look at that.  Let me see.  With De Niro?  That's Al Pacino.  Yeah.  What the hell happened to Al Pacino?  He cut all his hair off.  Why?  And that's what he looks like now.  He looks like the alien from Aliens. 
[00:16:00]  Isn't that crazy?  He looks like Zippy the Pinhead.  What happened?  Oh, boy.  He smiles at all those teeth and stuff.  Wow, they really got a bad picture.  Oh.  Oh, that is...  That's frightening.  Isn't it?  He looks retarded.  I know it's a visual, but...  All right.  You got another clip?  You said it.  No, I got another sight, so I'll be looking for more, but there's a whole bunch.  All right.  Let's go to Matt.  Hey, Matt.  What's going on? 
[00:16:30]  What's up?  Oh, boy.  Matt?  Yo.  Hey.  What's up, Matt?  Hey, look.  Um, you can't...  All right.  We're going to cut it off.  Kathy, what's up?  Oh, my God.  You guys are so damn funny.  I saw you all in D.C. on Friday night and had the best time of my life, and I wanted to  hear somebody say Porterhouse from Caddyshack.  Actually, it's amazing you say that.  Pop me off, although I think I got a clip.  All right.  Oh, Porterhouse.  Just look at the wax buildup on those shoes.  This is fine leather. 
[00:17:00]  I want that wax stripped off there.  I want them creamed and buffed with a fine chamois, and I want them now.  Chop, chop.  You got it.  Did you hear the one about the colored boy?  Porterhouse.  Look at the wax buildup on these shoes.  Thank you very, very much.  All right.  Bye.  Classic.  All right.  I think this is the clip.  Oh, secret.  Have you heard the latest one about the Jew, the Catholic, and the colored boy who went 
[00:17:30]  to heaven?  Yeah.  That's a doozy, Judge.  That's a good boy.  Why, you son of a bitch, I'll get you.  Oh, no.  That's great.  The latest one about the Jew, the Catholic, and the colored boy. 
[00:18:00]  Colored boy.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's happening, guys?  Hey.  I don't know if you caught the TV guy at the 50 Greatest TV Shows thing they just did.  Yeah, we were going to talk about that.  Yeah, Mary Tyler Moore was in there.  They talk about how great Mary is, and she's cool.  And then they talk about all the great side characters, Luke Grant, that whore Rhoda.  And they left out Ted Knight.  They don't even mention him.  Well, Mary Tyler Moore wasn't that funny on the show.  I think her role was more the straight lady.  Yeah, but Ted Knight was the funniest thing about the whole show, and they neglect to mention 
[00:18:30]  him, you know?  Without a doubt.  They did this big honor for him on the thing last night, and they don't even mention him  in the write-up about the show.  Yeah.  And no respect, you know?  All right.  No respect.  All right.  I think I found another entertaining Ted Knight clip.  Our little tribute to Ted Knight.  I'm having a little party at the yacht club this Sunday.  I'm christening my new sloof.  What are you doing this Sunday?  No plans?  Wait.  How would you like to mow my lawn?  Huh?  I figured a college-bound fellow could use a few extra dollars. 
[00:19:00]  Huh?  Yeah.  And when you're finished, why don't you drop by the yacht club?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  All right.  All right.  We've wanted that clip for a long time.  I know.  Just the mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  That's all we want is that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Another one.  Oh, really?  Yeah, yeah.  This guy loaded me up.  Excellent rounds. 
[00:19:30]  Excellent rounds.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Top notch.  Hey, Brendan, you're on the O.P. and Anthony Show.  What's up?  What's up, fellas?  You guys aren't even talking about Too Close or Comfort when he was on there with that other  guy, Muriel.  He was like, hey, Muriel.  Remember, he was more retarded on that show than he was on Mary Tyler Moore or anything.  I got to say, I never really saw Ted Knight on Too Close or Comfort.  He was all with that gay guy, J.J., whatever.  Was he funny or?  I never watched the show.  It always seemed to be a little too gay. 
[00:20:00]  He was funny to make fun of, but not really one-liners or anything.  Yeah.  All right.  I've done.  Thanks, bro.  All right.  Here's another from Caddyshack, The Immortal, Ted Knight.  It's easy to grin when your ship comes in and you've got the stock market beat, but the  man worthwhile is the man who can smile when his shorts are too tight in the seat.  Okay, boo. 
[00:20:30]  Now we're getting requests for Ted Knight Clips.  Tracy, what's up?  Um, can you guys play the I'll Give You Asthma Clips?  I'll go, I'll Give You Asthma, that one.  Yeah, we don't have it yet.  We'll find it.  Someone will send it to us.  All right, bye.  All right, we got another Ted Knight song, Anthony.  This was the best one.  Who Put the Bump?  Who Put the Bump?  In the bump ship?  Oh, God.  I'd like to thank the guy who wrote the song that made my baby and fall in love with me. 
[00:21:00]  If I saw it.  Who Put the Bump in the bump, bop bop, bop bop?  Who Put the Bump in the ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?  Who Put the Bump in the bump, shabubo, shabubo?  Who Put the d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-do?  Who was that man?  I'd like to take his hand.  He made my baby fall in love with me.  And my baby turned in.  Yeah.  And my baby heard 
[00:21:30]  Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum  Every word was right in front  And when she heard them singing  She said we'd never have to bark  All right, that's all  Oh, put the bump in the bums, your bums  Okay, here's the boat  Which one is this?

You probably don't have any to close.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll show you.  You probably don't have any.  You're probably all empty and shallow inside.  And then I put you underneath and, you know what I mean.  You probably don't have nothing.  You don't have a camera without the glass on your face, you squat.  You have nothing to begin with anyway.  I wouldn't even give you the time a day.  How's that?  You take it like a whore, like you are, huh?  I wouldn't even give you the time a day.

What are you, like a midget?  I heard you're a midget and you got no dick. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  You wish, honey.  You wish.  All right, there I go.  All right, guys.  We don't want to burn you out.  All right, big boy.  Where was the last term you had a spanking?  Nice girl, but about as sharp as a sack of wet mugs.  Is that Doug still on the phone?  Uh.  Is that Doug still on the phone?  Hello? 
[00:47:00]  They hung up on me.  Hello?  Did they?  What is that?  What are they saying?  Let me hear them.  Well, there you go.  Look, I think I feel like she's pissing me off.  You know what, though?  Frenchie is back in the listeners' good graces, man.  Ben, what's up?  Yo, I just wanted to call and say I hate Frenchie, but goddamn, he just redeemed himself. 
[00:47:30]  That was awesome.  Yeah, Frenchie.  Yeah, that was pretty funny.  Yeah.  Frenchie's doing the Frenchie dunking booth at the celebrity bikini softball game.  You're welcome.  All right.  I like how he's going to fill her mouth up until she drowns.  Like the whore that you are.  Where's the tape of Stinky yelling at Heather the Feather and her friend?  Oh, that one's classic.  We've got to play that going into break.  We had Stinky, Heather the Feather and her girls were so annoying that we had Stinky attack them.  I like when you say, Psycho Mark wants to say something. 
[00:48:00]  Who?  What, you don't listen to the show?  What, for three years?  That was funny.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  You're a filthy whore!  All right, Rick is just trying to find this tape, and we'll take that into break.  How annoying.  Now someone's saying Ted Knight had prostate cancer, Anthony.  What?  I should get that checked out, Spaulding.  Let's go to Mike.  Hey, Mike, what's up?  Frenchie, the new pit bull of the O&A show. 
[00:48:30]  It's always funny to put Frenchie on.  Well, you know, I was getting tired of him, and that was the best Frenchie use ever.  You know what, he had a great line, but then he said the F word, so we had to dump out him.  And I just walked out of my job today, guys, and you guys just cheered me up, so keep it going.  And what happened to you in the job?  Oh, it's just too long a story, but all I can say, first of all, he wouldn't let me listen to you guys.  Oh.  And then, finally, I found syndication on the ground, so that worked out.  Nice.  But anyway, keep it going. 
[00:49:00]  You guys are great.  All right.  Hang in there, Mike.  Thanks, man.  All right.  We got the tape, Anthony.  Want to set this up before break?  Well, that lovely girl, Heather, was in with a couple of other strippers.  And they were outside in the green room just being annoying.  They had come into the studio.  I don't even know why they were here or what.  I don't even want to get into it.  But they were annoying.  And I figured we'd have some fun, so we put a mic out there and had Stinky just go after  the girls, just taunt them until they lost their minds. 
[00:49:30]  And Stinky did a great job.  And then there was a fight.  Beer went flying everywhere.  So we'll go to that tape.  Real fast, though, Dan from Hoboken.  Wow.  Frenchie has been working on new material.  Yeah.  I liked it.  All right.  Here's the tape of Stinky going after these chicks.  You guys got to leave.  What?  You guys got to leave.  Why?  You guys were, like, plugging too much.  You're doing drugs in the bathroom.  Who was doing drugs in the bathroom?  Everyone's saying you're doing coke in the bathroom.  Get out of here. 
[00:50:00]  My ass.  First of all, all right?  Doing drugs?  Do you want to get my cocky?  We turned it on and got the toilet.  That's it bad.  You didn't want to plug the toilet.  She flushed the toilet and it went right there.  Yeah.  It was a magic thing.  You didn't want to plug the toilet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Wow, I didn't know how it worked.  Yeah.  Did we not have drugs?  That's a...  I don't want you to leave because you're all annoying, so...  Annoying?  Yeah.  You know what?  We...  No, we know.  We were told what happened.  Your girlfriend's not here today, so you're a little bit upset. 
[00:50:30]  Uh-huh.  We understand.  No problem.  That's all right.  I know.  It's just I want lovely whores like you guys to talk to.  Whores?  You know what's a good whore?  Baby, I promise.  You wish you had a bitch.  I look right here.  I love stupid whores.  Stupid whores?  Okay, douchebag.  No.  We have whores?  I don't think so.  Your girlfriend's...  Would you look at this kid?  Would you look at him?  And look who he's talking to?  His girlfriend's not here.  But wait.  We're doing drugs in the bathroom.  And we're whores.  And we're whores.  Did I say, Mike, could you just...  That makes you even worse? 
[00:51:00]  You're a stripper?  That doesn't take off your clothes?  We're not strippers.  We're not strippers.  We're not strippers.  We are not strippers.  We're not strippers, daddy.

You're not strippers.  We're not strippers.  You're ugly motherf***ing.  You want to hate your dads, and you want approval from men to take your clothes off so they will  take you and like you.  Wrong.  Okay, go cut your hair, and then come talk to me. 
[00:51:30]  I don't want you to look at me and like me.  Then why are you here?  I don't think you realize that.  But we want to be put up here by my boss.  You're right here.  That's why I'm here.  To take your clothes off, because you're a stupid guy.  And I can take my clothes off.  Everything I do, and I wear wrong.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  Let's leave the place.  And knock this guy out.  You're wrong.  Oh, my.  You came here to take your clothes off.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  You're wrong.  So, people work.  You're ugly.

Bartender!  What's your job?  Bartender!  What's your job?  Bartender!  Bartender!  Bartender!  If you make so much money, why are you here on a radio show?  Take your clothes off!  Are you paying for my clothes?  I know, because you stupid whores! 
[00:53:00]  You know what?  Okay.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Don't do that.  Wait, wait, wait.  You f***ing douchebag.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's wrong with you?  He wants to f***ing douchebag.  He doesn't even know what a f***ing douchebag is.  But he never had a f***ing douchebag, because he's an ugly mother.  He got laid.  He's what her life's all about.  He might have been a one-bath. 
[00:53:30]  They're just jealous, but they didn't speak to him.  Let's go.  We don't need f***ing.  I'll just buy a f***ing.  That was funny.  Do you like to say my husband?  I don't even let this guy abuse me like that.  He was the only f***ing douchebag.  You let him abuse you because you know why you need to open your mouth.  That's not true.  That is not true.  He didn't call me a whore.  I was sitting on the other side minding my baby hoes.  The O.B. and Anthony Show. 
[00:54:00]  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Off the instant feedback, Mills from Jersey writes, Frenchie actually being cool.  Yeah.  What's next?  Rich Voss making me laugh?  Nah, that's not possible.  We, of course, just had the lovely Heather the Feather on the phone being annoying as usual. 
[00:54:30]  She was one of the strippers in.  We just played the clip of Stinky.  Are you guys there?  She sounds like Fran Drescher.  Stinky going off on the three whores, as he put it.  And they got all pissed off.  Well, Adam from Valley Stream, big fan of the show, adds a lot.  Valley Stream, right?  Valley Stream Central.  Welcome back to Brewer's hometown.  He writes, Ant, I love when the leader whore, at one point during that conversation with Garrett,  says, assume you know what the first three letters are. 
[00:55:00]  And then Adam writes, at that point you can hear the wheels slowly turn as her whore friends try to figure out what those three letters are.  As we emphasize, slowly turn.  He goes, just play the part again.  It's the best part.  They all chime in at the same time when they finally figure it out.  But there is a delay.  The first three letters of assume when she asks, listen for the delay, and then they're, ah, they all figure it out at the same time.  Thanks, Adam.  This is great.  Let's listen.  You're insinuating, excuse me, you're assuming, you know the first three letters. 
[00:55:30]  Assuming.  Assuming.  Oh, that is brilliant.  You're assuming you know the first three letters.  I do.  Um, hey.  Oh.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, you guys.  Want color eggs?  What?  Tim Brewer in studio.  I have, uh, you know something?  This job has, uh, definitely put me off of strippers. 
[00:56:00]  I cannot take strippers anymore.  I guess it's fine if you just go into the club, you sit down and watch them dance.  Some of the girls from Privilege are pretty cool.  You know something?  They don't have that obnoxious attitude.  I'm putting them all in one category right now.  Oh, boy.  You know why?  Oh, boy.  They're fine.  You go to the Privilege, you go to Privilege, you sit down, you watch naked girls dance.  That's it.  The second they pass through that porthole and come into this studio, into our world,  I can't, they cannot be hot enough to tolerate the misery that I get put in by having to listen 
[00:56:30]  to that drivel.  First of all, they stink like stripper.  There's a certain perfume that's out on the market called hose bag.  What is it?  What is it?  Try some of this, put it right next to your balloon on it.  Yeah.  Guys, love it.  It's called, I think it's akin to that white goop that comes out of a tiger's butt when  they mark a tree.  You know, because they've got to mark their territory, maybe in the strip club. 
[00:57:00]  Because every guy that might want to go there and catch some can before he's got to go home  to his sea wife, maybe a few of them want to go home smelling like whore, you know?  So they've got to rub that all over you.  And then there's just the talking.  That talk they do.  First of all, they talk themselves up much too much.  I think they hang out with each other and they tell each other how extremely hot they  are.  They're not quite as hot as they like to come across.  Believe me.  Believe me. 
[00:57:30]  Turn around and look in that mirror, honey.  Turn around.  That ass ain't quite a snare drum anymore, okay?  Sitting a few minutes too long in the gravel driveway a lot of times.  And you had a bad experience, man.  It's called the show.  It's off me, the strippers.  And then on the talk.  I'm just doing this to support myself.  No, so I'm going to be really smart and I'm going to own a computer company.  But in the meantime, I'm going to let people stick pork chops in behind me.  I am sick of it. 
[00:58:00]  You know who I met one time?  Molly Crew.  He was so cool.  Molly Crew, girls, girls.  I didn't know that was his song.  I can't take it.  The normal, regular, everyday girls that come in when we have contests or something.  And they take their clothes off aside from maybe our last contest.  Much better.  And not all of them because there were a couple of really hot ones during the Money Snatch. 
[00:58:30]  Well, when are you going to name the hot ones from the Money Snatch contest?  You've been talking about how there were a few hot ones.  Why don't you name names?  Opie, they know who they are.  Let me just put it that way.  There was some real wrecks.  But I'll tell you, a couple of them were so hot.  You've been praising a few girls who don't want a Money Snatch game.  They know who they are.  Give them some credit today.  I'll describe one.  About this tall?  You're such a dude.  Why?  They were all that tall.  Had hair down to here.  With the hair?  What? 
[00:59:00]  I'm just saying.  Molson had long hair.  I didn't even say long.  I was like, down to here.  They're a couple of them, and they know who they are.  Opie, so I don't have to say anything.  They would probably feel better about themselves today.  So why don't you give them a little credit?  Carol, they're totally talking about teeth.  All right.  They had teeth.  The hot ones.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, Anthony, Jim Brewer in the studio.  Yeah.  He is playing in our 2002 Opie and Anthony Celebrity Slash Bikini Softball game. 
[00:59:30]  And Opie already pitching to have Brewer on his team.  You know why?  Because I found out that he's been at the batting cage all day.  That's the type of player I need on my team.  That's great.  Here's what Opie was doing during commercials.  Dude, you let me have Brewer.  I'll give you Jay Moore.  I'm like, Jay Moore.  First of all, last softball game we played, Jay Moore struck out to start the whole game.  First batter up, he strikes out in slow pitch.  Yeah, it'll be lovely.  Dude, the crowd is way wild.  I think there's a video clip of that somewhere of Jay Moore starting the game off by striking out in slow pitch. 
[01:00:00]  The crowd was so loud.  After he got two strikes, everyone's like, oh, my God, he cannot strike out.  And you can see his knees, like, wobbling.  There goes that bat.  Whoosh.  Flock.  Here's the ball, that big melon ball in the catcher's glove.  I'll always have that on him, which is nice.  Steak.  The crowd went crazy. 
[01:00:30]  And this is the man you want to pin on me.  Showtime Apollo.  Yeah.  And here's Anthony talking to Jay Moore as he walks back to the dugout there.  There's no crying baseball.  Jay hung his head and just dragging the bat behind him just went to the dugout.  And the crowd, I remember being in the dugout.  And now we're in there, so you can't really see the crowd behind us.  But you just hear them.  The war.  And Jay just looks at me and goes, I don't know what happened. 
[01:01:00]  I know what happened.  They know what happened.  You struck out in slow pitch softball.  You numb nuts.  Get out.  But you remember now.  And everyone in your dugout, they couldn't look him in the eye.  No, no.  They made believe they didn't see him coming back into the dugout.  Hey, man, shake it off.  It's cool.  Good eye.  Good eye.  Barry.  Yeah.  It's cool, man.  I don't see that.  Oh, there was Jay is gay.  Chance went, got started.  It was ridiculous.  But if you remember, he was also at the batting cages with everybody else.  It's been two years, and he's been hoping that we forgot. 
[01:01:30]  But wasn't he popping them at the batting cages?  How was he doing?  Oh, he said he was doing great at the batting cages.  He was hitting them.  He did nothing but talk himself up.  For a month.  He made sure he looked like a baseball player.  Oh, he came out.  He had all the gear on.  He came out.  I had, like, cut-off jeans shorts on or something.  Right.  He had it all, bro.  He strut out like, what was everything?  Yeah, everyone showed up to Drake Jason, like, center field, the tight sweatpants on with  the real...  He strutted out like the cock of the roost. 
[01:02:00]  He came out.  He has...  John Rockard?  He had some chew in his mouth there.  A little dip in the lip.  Yeah, the dip.  He had a batting glove.  He spits.  He taps his cleats a little, looks out where the ball's going to go.  He had the dark lines under his eyes.  Oh, all ready to go.  He was rocking, man.  He swings the bat around a little, takes position in the box, gets his stance, whoosh, whoosh.  Two more, J.J. 
[01:02:30]  Two more.  Watch what you're swinging.  J.J., getting cocky.  Go for the low one.  Second swing.  Whoosh.  J.J.  Hey!  What are you swinging at?  Wait for the good one.  It's softball.  J.J., you're getting cocky now.  Pay attention.  People are watching.  It's high.  It's high.  Punk.  Jesus.  J.J.  What did I say?  Go sit down. 
[01:03:00]  Go sit down.  And the long walk off that field for Jay Moore.  And we have audio.  Spike out.  We have more audio of Jay Moore talking to Anthony because he was convinced that Anthony was going  to kick him off the team.  Oh, really?  I got nowhere else to go.  I got nowhere else to go.  Okay.  Dirt.  He's a good actor, though.  He doesn't know for that.  All right.  He doesn't know for that.  He was a wrestler in Verona. 
[01:03:30]  I don't know how that translates to softball.  But he talked himself up for a month.  And I was like, I can't believe I got Jay Moore on my team.  I was so psyched that I got Jay Moore on my team.  And we got...  Dude, I broke the record.  Yeah.  In high school.  You did.  For, like, wiffle ball tournament.  Wiffle ball.  That's a...  Wiffle ball.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, he did.  Yeah, you want to play wiffle ball?  Dude, I was state champion.  He was like, dude, I got mad skills. 
[01:04:00]  You're going to see them.  Succeed.  Whoosh.  Whoosh.  So, look, man.  I want Brewer on my team.  Hey, Jay.  What are you swinging at?  You take Jay Moore again.  I am not trading now.  I have the list in front of me.  I see some of the people here that I had last year on my team.  I have the likes of Rick Cerrone.  Wow.  I have the likes of Barry Williams.  He stunk.  I had Brady Bunch, Barry Williams.  Stunk.  I got my ass kicked.  I sat Joe Torrey's son the last time we played. 
[01:04:30]  Swear to God.  Yeah.  He's like, he finally comes up to me.  It was like bottom of the seventh.  We're up by, like, 12 runs.  And he's like, hey, man, can I play?  Shit, you're out.  I'm like, all right.  Play second.  Mike Torrey, he's a great guy.  I have my brother, Joe.  That's it.  We do very well.  I sat Torrey's son.  Cowbell Bill.  I had a team full of drunks.  Well, yeah, you didn't take it too seriously last time.  Well. 
[01:05:00]  And I'm assuming you're not going to take it seriously again, so I'm going to take Jim Brewer.  No.  Ping.  You don't get Brewer.  When are we going to do the draft?  Just outright.  I don't know when we're starting the draft.  We have to do the draft.  Ping.  We're still waiting to see if, like, Glennie Clark's definitely joining us.  Hey, Clark.  Let me tell you something.  I'm going to hit that ball.  You better put me on your team, Opie.  I'll tell you that right now.  Because if a man on your team has got to be trying to figure out, me and Brewer are the same team?  Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me? 
[01:05:30]  Oh, my God.  Go to bed.  Me and Brewer are back-to-back worse than Movan.  And who's that other jackass?  Strikes out 50 times.  I'm going to fake a mess already.  Jeremy's strike.  He's like Kingman.  Jeremy, but Blitz.  He hits eight homers.  But he struck out 820 times already, for Christ's sake.  Pull me and Brewer on the same table.  I'll both take care.  Wow.  Oh.  I mean, I hate the effing Yankees.  Because I'm a boss.  I can't believe I don't go with a mess.  That is the Lenny Clark experience. 
[01:06:00]  That's Clarkamania.  We're in the broads.  Let's go.  Take your shirt off, sweetie.  Come on.  Wow.  He rules.  Nice.  Oh, gee.  Who knew that one was in you?  Lenny Clark rules.  Yes, he does.  All right.  Well, instead of wasting time on this, we'll have the draft.  Yeah.  You want to try to have it Monday?  We'll start Monday.  All right.  We're going to have the draft.  It's going to be a long, drawn-out process.  Not really.  Oh, please.  You don't think?  Come on.  We'll have the draft on Monday for the celebrity softball game. 
[01:06:30]  By the way, there's only...  Pickens are so slim, by the way.  I am looking at some of these people.  It is awful.  It is awful.  There's just a few key players you need to get on your team, and the rest is like filler.  Frenchy?  Rich Voss?  Voss?  What the hell is Voss going to do?  Huh?  Voss was telling me down in D.C. he's a great athlete.  He was a great softball player when he was in the league, and he also played football.  Paul?  Adam Ferrara?  You ever see Adam run? 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  You can do an impression of Adam running.  Take some of those elastic things that you tie maybe books to your bike with.  What do they call them?  The bungee cords?  And bungee your knees together.  Now try to run.  There you go.  See?  See what that looks like?  That's Adam running normally.  That's why he's in the infield.  And does Norton play?  Norton looks like nothing as far as sports go.  Nothing.  And how about Paul?  Hey, Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on Mercurio.  Does he play?  I see him as like a second-faced team. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, boy.  This is going to be a mess.  Who, Norton?  No, Mercurio.  Steven Lynch is a good player if you can keep him away from the beer.  Yeah, that's true.  He's good in the early innings.  You want to play him the first three innings and get him out of there.  Three innings?  Tom.  The first inning.  You need a fat dude.  Do you know any fat dudes?  The fat dudes did not come through last time.  No, no, no.  Really?  Yeah.  Just tell Norton to hold the bat like it's Voss' schlong.  And then tell him to take it out of his mouth and hold it with his hands. 
[01:08:00]  So we'll do the draft Monday.  All right.  Monday it starts.  By the way, the celebrity softball game, Anthony?  Yeah.  Only standing room tickets left.  Wow.  Really?  We've sold like 6,000 tickets already, and they're going to put another 1,000 on sale like standing room.  That's great.  And besides the fun of the softball game, plenty more things going on all over the place.  We're going to have like a midway-type atmosphere with all kinds of piercing, tat things. 
[01:08:30]  The Titanic slide.  The Titanic slide.  All kinds of little odd boutiques and whatnot.  The Frenchie displays.  Dumpling booth.  Yeah.  Getting drunk, fighting Mexicans.  Oh, yeah.  That's a booth.  That's set up the Mexican guy.  See?  Punch me.  It's going to be great.  It's going to be a hell of a time.  Oh, Ben's got a secret.  Yeah, he's got a secret.  A secret special thing.  Sponsored by Coors Light, Anthony.  And also, we should remind people.  Coors Light!  We're going to bring about 10 of our listeners down during halftime. 
[01:09:00]  We're going to do a halftime in softball.  And these listeners are going to have a chance to win $25,000 doing the softball pitch thing, Anthony.  And some other prizes provided by Sonic Blue.  Sonic Blue's new Rio Riot MP3 player.  You can put 5,000 songs in the palm of your hand.  Check it out at your local electronics retailer or sonicblue.com.  They're helping us out as well.  So, if you want to go, man, standing room only.  Tickets available through Ticketmaster.  By the way, Stephen Lynch on Friday night on NBC, on the show, what, Friday night it's called? 
[01:09:30]  Nice.  And he was introduced as frequent guest on the Opie and Anthony show.  Nice.  Very nice.  Thank you, Lynch.  And Brewer hooked us up during his special.  Oh, my God, yeah.  Big time.  Look at you.  Very cool.  Oh, I did.  I did what I do.  What I do.  What did I do now?  What did I do?  What did I do?  What did I do?  I write something?  It was like, thanks to Opie and Anthony.  Special thanks.  It was one of those special thanks.  And then there was a clip of you on our show and stuff during the special. 
[01:10:00]  We've been banged.  Very nice.  It was very nice.  You didn't know.  Very nice.  All right.  Jim Brewer hanging today.  We got to get a Stalker Patty update, Anthony.  Yeah, we kind of ran out of time.  She seems to be homeless.  She's in a shelter.  She was sleeping here.  She is sleeping here.  I have no clue.  She was sleeping under the stairs for a while.  Yeah, under the stairs.  You know Stalker Patty.  Yeah.  A little, like, beauty.  Yeah.  We helped her out last week.  We did a very good thing and got her kicked out of her apartment. 
[01:10:30]  That was good.  She's had a killer place, too.  $100 a month.  $100 a month she was paying rent.  Just Talker in it.  Well, briefly, let's see if we could get this done quickly.  We had a contest called the Money Snatch, which girls had to get completely naked, and we  put money all over the studio and gather up as much money as they could.  They could not hold it in their hands.  I heard part of that.  Yes, yes, yes.  Right.  It was one of the best things we can go in.  It was a very special arrangement of where they had to put the money. 
[01:11:00]  It was so long.  So Patty, being broke, she wanted to get in on this contest.  We said, okay.  Her landlord found out that she wanted to do this.  Her landlord that Patty pays $25 a week to, and said, if you do this, we're throwing you  out.  You can't do things like that.  We got all pissed and said, you're an adult woman.  You should be able to do what you want.  Sure.  So the landlord called.  The daughter of the landlord called.  This bitch, bitch, twat, C.F.  Calls up.  Real stinker.  Yeah.  So we just got into it with her, and she said, fine. 
[01:11:30]  Patty's stuff is going to be out on the lawn.  She's out.  So she had no home anymore.  We got her thrown out.  And then we told her she couldn't be in the contest.  Yeah.  So she's been living here in the studio.  She sleeps out on the couch or on the stairs.  She couldn't sleep on the couch Saturday night because Eddie Trunk was doing his hard rock  show, and Mike Piazza was up here.  And he goes, you know, I got guests and stuff.  I can't have Mike Piazza sit down on the couch with a sleeping stalker Patty. 
[01:12:00]  So she went and slept under the stairs.  Under the stairs in the lobby.  She just rolled.  She had this old, disgusting, like, sleeping bag thing and a stuffed rabbit that she just  slept with.  And she kind of.  So now we hear the last call we got from her was yesterday, very late in the show.  We had to cut her off.  She was at a woman's shelter, and that's where she's living.  They're going to pay for it.  Until she could.  Yeah, she's like, I can't stay on very long.  Get out the phone, girl. 
[01:12:30]  Smack your side of your head.  Get out.  Get that cracker.  You get your cracker face away from that phone, mother F.  I'm going to cut you.  I'm going to cut you, bitch.  So Starker Patty listens to us every day.  So Patty calling.  We want to get an update, okay?  Hey, listen.  And I see her laying in that, like, cot of a bed in the shelter with this little radio.  Oh, man, Anthony's here.  She's here.  What?  She's here?  Patty's here?  She lives here.  Well, this is her house now.  Oh, my God.  I was just in the living room.  All right, listen.  I heard you in my living room. 
[01:13:00]  And she's walking down the hall, but we do have to take a break.  Let's do that.  And then we'll get into it.  We'll get a Starker Patty update.  We also have Chuck Farnham, our old friend.  We were talking about him yesterday.  Yes.  He's calling in today, Anthony.  Anthony, we've got to talk about the new video game you're into lately.  I am so good.  I am so happy that I have not played EverQuest.  We'll see what Biller's up to.  To open up a bunch of new games.  I don't know if he's up to anything, but we'll see if he's got anything there.  Yeah.  That he wants to talk about.  And right now we'll go to the F.U. line.  Right.  Thanks for calling.  And here's the opiate Anthony F.U. line. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I want to give a f*** you to the doctor who looked at my dog's belly about a year ago.  F*** veterinary clinic in North Andover, Mass.  Yeah, guess what?  That little rash that you said to put Benadryl on turned out to be the big f***ing scene.  I see her later.  Now my dog's got f***ing controllers all over his f***ing body.  And he's going to die.  So thanks for charging me $350 to tell my dog to put Benadryl on his belly.  You f***ing cool douchebag.  Next message. 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, I just got a big f*** you for myself for becoming good friends with a girl that if I would have paid attention, I could have f***ed that month ago.  So f*** me.  Next message.  Yeah, I want to give a big f*** you to my ex-girlfriend who's giving me herpes and making my junk with a pepperoni pizza.  F*** you.  Next message.  This is a big f*** you to my boss and my future brother-in-law.  You're a pig and you don't pay me enough.  But that's alright because I do it on your sister's face when I'm done. 
[01:14:30]  End of messages.  Have you ever seen the people that listen to this show?  Obie and Anthony.  Who plays drunk in white trash?  Got that right.  Jim Brewer hanging with us today.  This is the Obie and Anthony Show.  Hey.  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot.  You do your hot wires?  Um, yes.  I did my hot wire read during the commercial break.  I'm debuting a new voice.  Oh, what did you do?  Kind of a Clint Eastwood thing. 
[01:15:00]  What?  Yeah.  Now, we each have to go in and do our little hot wire reads.  During the commercials, we go into the production studio.  I read the same copy that Obie reads.  Because we're like Lennon and McCartney and we don't hang out together anymore.  Yeah, so we've got to record them at different times and different places in the world.  I will not be working with him in the same room.  In the same studio.  No.  So I do my part. 
[01:15:30]  And then it does his part.  And Steve puts it together and makes it sound like we were there at the same time.  Like we're trading lines.  So, what, you have a new style?  Yeah.  Because the last one's kind of like this.  Yeah.  Hey, hot wires.  Hot wires.  Save your money.  And get you on major airlines at discount airline prize.  Steve hates us at this point.  He just shakes his head.  But this is us crap.  You should hear my read.  I'm perfect.  The two of you are hilarious though, man.  You're like, can I have to come in?  The two of you are like, all right, we'll be there in a minute. 
[01:16:00]  Guys, there's people paying for you to say some stuff.  So if you want to come hang.  How long is it?  Steve, now.  Get Steve in there.  Because, you know, Ben and Steve have this whole thing going.  They're trying new ways to get us into that studio.  You're a real pain in the ass.  This used to be like at 7-Eleven.  Hang out.  And it would never get brewery.  You need to get measured.  All right.  I'll be there in a second, man.  Come try on your hat.  I'll be there in a second.  Hold on. 
[01:16:30]  Jesus.  Now, Steve.  You guys are.  Now, Steve.  Did you see what Steve does?  Anthony's reading the paper.  We get ready to go to break.  Right.  And Steve is already in here staring at us.  Like, Opie hits the button that puts us in the commercial.  Steve is already here going, guys.  Yeah.  Guys.  We got the hotwire read.  We really have to do this new hotwire read.  We told him it would be done last week.  But he pulls me in.  He goes, yeah, we got a hotwire read, Anthony.  Come in.  And then he goes, oh, we got five other pieces.  Because between the last time I asked you and the time you just got into the studio, 
[01:17:00]  three more showed up.  So now I'm reading all kinds of things.  The best is Steve will go, Opie, do I want to do the hotwire?  No.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll just tell people.  Yeah.  My problem.  Exactly.  That's exactly it.  Not my problem.  I'll just tell them.  They don't want to do it.  The best is Steve's email to the person that deals with all these national libraries the  other day.  It's like, that one, that hotwire one was done, do what, yesterday morning?  Yeah, yesterday morning.  The one we just did?  Yeah.  Or yesterday afternoon or something like that.  We are awful.  Steve emails are back.  We will try to get this done in a timely fashion. 
[01:17:30]  I always say, we'll try to get this done in a timely fashion, but just be advised that it  takes 72 hours minimally for the time that the copy arrives.  Any of the stations send stuff in now, it's like you're looking at a good week, week and  a half before you see this stuff.  You know, the reality is, the reality of the situation is, we can go in there and doing  it at any time.  It really is our fault.  We shouldn't argue so much.  You know, having responsibility, we're in the back office, giggling at Ted Nightclips. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Or, you know, during commercials.  I'd rather play pinball or foosball.  I said a whole thing.  Steve's got pressure from wherever.  You have to be on top of them.  You don't understand.  You have to get them to do this today.  What do you mean they don't want to?  Yeah, exactly.  We have a contract, damn it.  These people pay for them.  Explain that to them.  I immediately absolve myself of responsibility every time.  Steve just goes, okey-doke.  He said no.  The reason that we don't like our sponsors, we're in radio for a reason, because we're  lazy.  Yeah, things are bastards. 
[01:18:30]  Right.  Exactly.  We are lazy.  If we were responsible, we would have had regular jobs by now.  You should see the emails coming in from these different people.  Did they cut it yet?  Did they cut it yet?  And I just politely, nope.  I'll try again tomorrow.  In a timely fashion.  In a timely fashion.  I'd rather play a little pinball.  I'd rather play a little pinball or something.  But they should allow us just to do it live on the radio.  I don't know.  For some reason, they need theirs taped.  Because then we do the trade-off.  Right.  See, a lot of the reads, there are a few reads that Opie does, and I do a lot of the reads. 
[01:19:00]  And I think they like the idea of both of us bantering.  Bantering back and forth.  Yes.  Hey, I'm Opie.  And I'm Anthony.  And I'm Anthony.  And we're Opie and Anthony.  Oh, Christ on a pony.  So did you like my new voice?  Yeah.  What is this new voice now, Steve?  This Clint Eastwood-ish kind of, oh, that hot wire.  That hot wire.  What is it?  Give me a little.  Give me a little.  You got to hear the tape.  Give me a hot wire.  Is it almost done?  No.  If you give me like another five minutes, it'll be done. 
[01:19:30]  He'll break it.  Discount.  Discount airline prices for major airlines.  Hot wire's getting a lot of attention because of that stuff.  Hot wire.  Listen, punk.  Is that what you're doing?  Rich Voss, what's up?  Fuck.  It's Abin.  Hey, Voss.  Hey, before I get started, Opie, let's discuss how I killed a Virginia Friday.  All right.  Let's discuss that, the two I killed.  You know, it was sick, so I was kind of, you know, I went on stage in between you guys  and after you got off and stuff.  And I did say to the crowd, yeah, he really is funny, but please don't tell anyone. 
[01:20:00]  It'll wreck his image on the radio.  It'll ruin the beer.  Right.  No, you did kill it in Virginia.  People enjoy the Voss.  And you owe me $2 for the CD you smashed.  That was my bid in Virginia.  You owe me a CD.  I smashed the CD on stage and it got a nice applause.  How many CDs did you sell down there?  Huh?  I don't sell them in case the IRS will.  I give them away.  You give them away.  For a donation.  I gave 70 away. 
[01:20:30]  A donation for my daughters.  So, Voss, why are you calling us today?  All right, I'm calling you to discuss softball real quick.  Can those little hands get around the back?  Well, here's the thing.  I can't play outfield because my legs are too small and I can't catch the ball.  I can't run that fast.  But second base, like we used to have a softball team.  We were first in the league every year.  Oh, by the way, Dave is on the line.  He goes, Voss killed in Virginia.  Who did he kill?  Well, listen, we had a great softball team, although I did get kicked off my own team. 
[01:21:00]  It was my team.  Really?  Well, the one year they gave me all the money to sign up for the league and I spent it up in Harlem.  So, but here's the deal.  Here's the deal I'm going to tell you guys.  I play second base.  I'm allowed one error.  Anything over one error, I donate $25 for every error to something.  Wow.  Look at you.  Wow.  Is that a good deal?  Wow.  Why don't we do a competition?  I'll hit ten straight grounders to them. 
[01:21:30]  Wow.  Who's that, a brewer?  Yeah.  Hey, what's happening?  What's up, man?  If you're bad, that could get into the 50 of dollars.  Now, brewer, when you get up to bat, is there going to be a heavy metal band behind you playing?  Why not?  I know.  That's not enough, $25?  Hey, boss, you just impressed me.  I'm going to put you down.  I'm going to try to get you on my team.  No, I know how to play.  I know how to play sport.  I really do need a second baseman on my team.  Everyone had been on a team or something.  Everyone I'm talking to, oh, dude, I used to play in, whether it's high school, college, a league. 
[01:22:00]  Andrew, I'm very, I did nothing.  And by the way, can you play drums?  Can I?  Yeah.  No, I can't.  Oh, bummer.  I need a drummer.  You need a drummer?  Yeah, man.  Do you drummers have the right new material?  Yeah.  Well, no, you can do your act.  We'll just do it at the drum set.  Boss, Andrew's on the line saying, Boss could be the catcher.  He won't even have to squat down.  Oh.  No, we're going to use Paul McIrio's lips for a catcher's mitt.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:22:30]  Wow.  You guys are bad to each other.  Wow.  All right.  Here's the deal.  I'm allowed one error.  Any error over one, I get $25.  Is that a good deal?  That's a great deal, boss.  You know, I'm already given $100 for Paddy's haircut.  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, we're always going to tell people that halftime of the softball game, we're shaving  Paddy's head again.  I told you.  On the big jumbotron, you'll get to see that head of purse.  We're giving her something like $906 that were collected by a bunch of other people.  Yeah, but a lot of the guys that said they were going to give money have blown us off  so far. 
[01:23:00]  Not me.  That's true.  I'll give $200 if she chops off a finger.  All right.  Shuts her head off.  Hey, boss, we've got to go.  All right.  Well, here's the deal.  Second base, Rich Voss.  I guarantee I'll come.  You're horrible.  I know, Ben.  I can't believe you did that.  Anyway, do we have time to get Stalker Paddy in here?  Rich Voss, really?  Okay.  Bring Paddy in, would you?  She's useless.  Way to put it.  Here's a woman that has no home. 
[01:23:30]  Don't you people have homes?  Hi, guy.  Okay, Paddy.  Kill yourself.  Shut up.  All right, Paddy.  Paddy, hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Are you dying your hair?  What are you doing to your hair?  It looks darker.  I washed it if that's what it looks like.  Patty, how far up are your pants pulled? 
[01:24:00]  Look at her pants.  They're all lined up with your pants.  It's like a circle.  You've got the circle thing going on.  Well, I'm homeless.  I'm just hoping I can find a place to live.  Look at you.  How was the shelter last night?  Very frightening.  Frightening?  Very scary.  Patty, in the best way, in the most capable way that a retard can do it,  could you please describe in detail what a night at the women's shelter is like? 
[01:24:30]  Well, I came in.  Run us through it.  And the first thing I had to do was put my stuff on a conveyor belt.  And then they searched me what's in my pockets.  I had to take all my change out and stuff.  Was it an X-ray machine conveyor belt or just one that sent it through some wacky scheme around the place?  It was an X-ray machine.  And it just orbits you all night on conveyor belt.  It was an X-ray machine.  And then they took the metal detector and they went up and all that. 
[01:25:00]  They scanned you and then you got on your flight to where?  Wait, this is at a shelter they do this?  Yes, they do that when you enter and leave.  So you can't get shanked, right?  Never, I guess.  Did they have any contraband on you, sharp objects that they said you couldn't bring in? 
[01:25:30]  No, nothing.  Was somebody in front of you or behind you that you saw that had some contraband?  Not that I know of.  And then you took that long walk down the hall to your room, right?  Did they strip you down and spray you with a fire hose?  No, actually, they made me sit in a chair for four hours before somebody saw me.  And then they had me sit until 10 o'clock at night when there was a bed.  A bed?  They had bed checks at 9 o'clock at night.  Hold on, hold on. 
[01:26:00]  Were there any...  Hold on.  There was a bed.  Yeah.  Stories?  A story?  No stories?  Like a story?  Well, did they tell you any stories or anything like that, Patty?  Well, I only know I saw two fights between security guards and people there.  What?  Gary.  Patty.  Here's a racist uncle.  Were they of colored nature?  Mostly.  Patty.  You had to wait for a bed? 
[01:26:30]  Yeah.  A few hours.  No, no, wait, because there wasn't a bed available for you?  Actually, no.  So you got to sit and wait for a bed to sleep in?  Yes.  You're waiting for it.  You're given a meal ticket that lets you get like a cold-tight breakfast of cereal and coffee and juice.  There's, Rudy.  Go get some bacon and some pork chops.  Keep your pooper clean.  So now you get a bed? 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And your meal ticket.  Now, you have your only possessions with you?  Yes.  And what are they?  Okay, they're just my clothes, my bunny rabbit, and my pocketbook.  And you're not allowed to carry your pocketbook or anything around with you.  You have to leave it by the table when you go for your meal and come back for it.  So I had to make sure that my MetroCard and my $2 or $3 that was in there was on me.  Whoa, yeah, $2 or $3.  You're not, I mean. 
[01:27:30]  Wow.  So now you got your possessions.  You finally get a bed.  Yes.  Now, what is that like?  What are the conditions that your bed is in, and how does that work?  Well, you go to an office window on the floor that they put you on, and they make you wait  another 10, 15 minutes, and then they give you linens.  But when I asked for a towel and a washcloth, they got a little huffy with me and said,  I don't have any more.  And I said, well, what do you want, what do I expect you to do? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know.  So I went back to the room, and there was somebody else's linen still on the bed who  didn't come in on time, so they lost their bed.  So when someone could come and get those things, so did I go put my clean things down?  I think she's had a nervous breakdown over there.  Yeah, I do.  I do.  You don't seem like the same Patty we know.  So, Patty, you have your linens, and you put them on your bed. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah.  And what was the bed like?  Was it a wonderful thing like you would get from a 1-800-TRY-A-BED?  No, it was no more than like a city cot.  At discount prices?  Oh, a cot.  Basically a cot, you know?  A roll-out cot?  Did it have springs on the bottom?  Yes, springs.  Do they confiscate your big toe because it's a weapon?  No.  That nail?  So, anyway, they have lights out at 10 o'clock.  They tell you when to go to bed.  You're not allowed to stay up later. 
[01:29:00]  You're not allowed to walk around during the night, even to go, you know, like go to the bathroom.  You have to use the bathroom that's in your room.  On the next Stalker Patty.  Of course, there was no toilet paper this.  I had to sneak to the other bathroom in the hallway just to have some, you know?  What is Stalker Patty doing in this head?  Why aren't you pounding Stalker Patty's guts out?  And then if you run into any security guards or walk past them, they're very hostile.  Are they?  They act very suspicious towards you.  What are they? 
[01:29:30]  What's the racial makeup of the security guards there?  I'd say about 90% black, 5% Spanish, and 5% white.  How many white women are in the whole place?  I probably saw about two besides myself.  Get your narrow ass back to be in.  Why don't you get your narrow ass back to be in?  This morning, I didn't remember. 
[01:30:00]  She's real distressed looking.  Yeah.  Now, this morning, I didn't remember the way to the ladies' room.  I went the wrong way.  This guard stepped out of nowhere, Billy Club and their side and everything, asking me,  Yo, yo, what are you doing?  Whoa, whoa.  I said, I clamped on my way.  Whoa, that was pretty good.  Yo, yo, yo.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  I said, finally, I said, look, bathroom, okay?  Bathroom.  Where?  That way.  Like that.  And I just went to the right way because I had my toothpaste and brush in my head.  And you bumped into Schillinger and Beecher doing it in the bathroom? 
[01:30:30]  She's losing her effing mind.  She is.  I talked to the other women in the room.  Some of them say they never see their caseworkers, even though they've been looking for them.  The caseworkers are either out to lunch or going somewhere.  Bureaucracy.  Welcome to the system.  Welcome to the machine.  I have audio, I'll be, of a couple of the security guards as they're making their rounds late at night.  Oh, let's all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to.  Oh. 
[01:31:00]  Look out.  Yeah.  And here's Patty talking to the security guards.  You're the two.  Charcoal friquette.  I'm moving on.  Then I saw a couple of nasty fights.  Yeah, fights?  I saw somebody let out of the shelter in handcuffs.  P.S.  I called.  P.S.  After lunch, I says, look, I'm going to leave and figure something else out.  And that was it.  Oh, you're not staying at the shelter anymore?  No.  Look at her eyes.  I'm afraid something will happen to me if I do. 
[01:31:30]  I'm scared.  We were hoping.  Wow.  So is it safe to say that you're sleeping under the stairs again tonight?  No, not actually.  Some nice gentleman called and said he would offer me two or three nights in his five-room apartment.  So I'm going to...  I think I'm going to take him up on it.  Where is this?  What town is this in?  Oh, it's just...  No.  Hunt's Point.  Hunt's Point.  No.  That's a pimp, Patty.  Man, you could be my number one lady.  I'll give you three nights for free. 
[01:32:00]  I'd let him all right.  I will show you love like no other man can.  No.  You just gots to take care of your daddy.  Get out on the street, bitch.  You like my hat?  You like my hat?  Here's Patty leaving the shelter, looking back over her shoulder and yelling,  What takes for nothing?  Wow.  Well, anyway, I had another idea.  So how did you hook up with this guy that's going to give you a place to live for a couple of days? 
[01:32:30]  And I took the line privately to talk to him.  But what did he say to you?  What did he say to you?  What did he say to you?  How did he lure you into it?  What wooed you?  What are his intentions?  Just to help?  He doesn't have an agenda or anything.  He's just wanting to help me out.  Seemed like a normal enough guy.  What does he do for a living?  I didn't ask him.  How old is he?  He said I had met him at the biggest night of fights for Ron and Fez.  He was the one that had me take a picture with two other people. 
[01:33:00]  We got audio of the guy that called up.  Oh, good.  They're all pink on the inside.  When that little beaver's right in front of you, dog.  That don't matter.  Hey, is this shelter on 8th Avenue and 15th Street?  No.  Oh, okay.  It is not.  All right.  Brooklyn cops saying, get her the hell out if that's the one.  It is in the East New York section.  Oh, my God.  East New York section of Brooklyn.  Yes.  Woo-hoo. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah.  Fatty is in the head.  Wow, man.  That's a nasty-ass area.  Well, we got Blind Dave checking in, Anthony.  Uh-huh.  Blind Dave is really blind.  Matter of fact, he did blind boxing for our radio show.  Oh, here's Patty leaving.  Wow.  Look how fast he got out of there.  We're going to do another round of blind boxing in the very near future.  We've got to get the cripple bouts in general.  Criple bouts back.  Sure.  Back.  Excuse me.  Blind Dave.  Hey, how's it going?  All right.  I just want to tell Patty, Patty, do you know why you're homeless? 
[01:34:00]  Yeah, and it wasn't exactly my fault.  No, no, no.  Yes, it wasn't, Patty.  I want to tell you why you're homeless.  What was it?  Because you don't have one friend that would take you in because you annoy the crap out of everyone.  Because you're a pitiful, sorry bitch.  And when you do finally kill yourself, leave a tape message for O&A and you'll be going,  I can't afford a coffin or a funeral. 
[01:34:30]  So if you guys, because you'll be pitiful in death as you are in life.  Society has thrown you away just like your parents did when you were a baby.  And just like you will never get laid, you will never have a real job.  You're a loser, get it over with, shoot yourself in the head.  We all hate you.  Thank you.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Wow.  I don't listen to the voice of ignorance. 
[01:35:00]  Yeah, but that was Dave.  I'm sorry, but he sent me.  Patty, does it strike a nerve with you when you think your entire life,  even from the moment you were an infant,  has been spent with people just leaving you somewhere  and you're not really having a place,  whether in someone's home or in society.  You seem to be a...  Your whole life you've been a foundling.  A lot of people are getting really pissed at us.  Paul's like, why don't you bastards help her out? 
[01:35:30]  Why don't you shut up?  Hey, do you understand what happened to her as a child?  No.  Oh, you don't want to know.  Her mother...  She's called a foundling.  Her mother was some type of burlesque dancer.  Okay.  And her father was a Wall Street executive that was married  and banged this stripper or whatever she was.  She got pregnant and had Patty.  And then as she was driving in Manhattan,  she stopped at a diner with a little basket with Patty in it 
[01:36:00]  and left her on the counter of the diner.  That was it.  As an infant.  She then went to the foundling home.  Patty, is that what it was called?  Well, it's New York foundling.  New York foundling.  And she was a foundling where she was placed in other foster homes  and raised by multiple parents, would you say?  Yeah.  Until you had a lot of church in your life,  a lot of religion in your upbringing,  which kind of made you a little uptight about your sexuality. 
[01:36:30]  Patty, that is the reason why you're a 45-year-old virgin right now, right?  Well, not necessarily.  Yes, necessarily.  I know you better than you know yourself, Patty.  So does Dave, apparently.  Yeah.  All right, listen.  Oh, God, this is the saddest thing ever.  Actually, that's not my concern anyway.  No.  All right.  Well, Patty, there's about five or six people on the line  that want to give you a lead on a play, so.  That would be awesome.  I could take those phone calls.  That would be awesome.  Why don't you take those phone calls, okay?  I sure will. 
[01:37:00]  All right.  There goes Patty.  There you go.  Patty spent one night in the shelter over there  in the East New York section of Brooklyn.  What's wrong with her foot?  We did that, too.  She walked out like a big club foot.  That's what pisses us off.  We help this girl all the time.  She's a big gorilla.  All it says is big foot.  She's limping because of us.  No, she's got two new feet because of us.  She had hammer toes.  She doesn't have body hair anymore because of us.  Of some feet and some feet. 
[01:37:30]  What do you mean new feet?  She had hammer toes.  She had hammer toes.  Like big, nasty.  You ever see a hammer toe?  No.  We got it fixed for free.  Here it is.  You know the bone that sticks out right there?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That sticks out so far, and your big toe actually folds over your other toes.  Like it's bent.  It looks like a hammer head.  Ew.  And we had a surgeon fix that up for her.  Fix her foot.  But what happened was she had to take off of work because she couldn't walk, so she had  no money to pay the rent in her $25 a week place. 
[01:38:00]  So they were kind of throwing her a bone and letting her stay there until she appeared  on this show, and that went to the wayside.  So they kicked her out for coming here and sticking some money in her cooler?  I like that.  It's not my fault, and she looks around here.  You can tell we have new listeners because they're like, why make fun of this poor girl?  You've got to understand the whole story.  She started out as a real stalker of this radio show.  East New York in Brooklyn is horrid.  Have you ever been to East New York in Brooklyn? 
[01:38:30]  It's like that movie.  What's a movie with Patch?  Which one was that?  With Kurt Russell.  Oh, Escape from New York.  That's what that area might be.  It is a horror show over there.  And the black guys in your regards, I swear to you, they are, they're pretty much just  one step above the criminals.  One step above the criminals.  What you looking at?  What's up?  What you looking at?  This is Snake. 
[01:39:00]  I'm looking for Patty.  Hey.  What up, kid?  I need my meal, my meal ticket.  Could, could I get my meal ticket, please?  Patty, just shut the F up and get on my back.  When I'm in danger, I duck and cover.  Duck and cover.  When I see a Negro with a gun, what do I do?  Duck and cover. 
[01:39:30]  Duck and cover.  Duck and cover.  Now roll.  Roll.  Ah, that poor, poor woman.  Well, there's a lot of people calling with places for Patty.  All right.  So you can feel better about yourselves in radio.  So how long was she in?  When did she finally get out?  She was in there for one day.  No, when she was a kid.  She didn't know what happened.  Oh, no, she, like, bounced around foster home to foster home until she finally, what's 
[01:40:00]  she bugging out about?  Earl, what's up?  Earl, what's up, Hammer?  What is he doing?  What's up there, Earl?  You find her funny?  No, no, he just said something really, really funny.  What'd she say?  Everybody's head.  I missed it.  I said there's five or six people offering her places to live so you can feel better about  yourself in radio land.  It's like a dog, just drive her out to, like, a farm and let her out at, like, three in  the morning.  Oh, dark. 
[01:40:30]  What's that?  What's that?  Drop her off in the woods like they said it.  Drop her in the woods like the kid from AI.  It seems nice.  Hi, Mr. Howling.  Howling.  I don't understand.  Oh, I'm getting bit by mosquitoes.  Hi, Mr. Elephant.  This is my stuffed bunny rabbit. 
[01:41:00]  Hey, look at the security guard swinging from the tree.  Thank God I have this.  Ah, that poor woman.  Everyone's picking up on this.  Paul E. from Lawrence.  Life must really stink when a blind guy tells you your life sucks. 
[01:41:30]  Blind Dave is the, he's the guy, though, man.  Wait, we got the guy that, he's totally blind.  He actually, for our show, went to Connecticut and got his driver's license.  He had someone with him that they had a whole scam going where he walked up to the counter  and the girl had told him what lines to read and stuff for the eye thing.  So, yeah, the codes behind him.  And he said that he had glasses, but he left them so could she just point to the line where he's got a sign. 
[01:42:00]  And, like, he bumped her finger and just signed his name.  And there it was.  He brought back to this show a photograph license to drive in Connecticut.  And he is 100% blind.  Stop, Brouwer.  Salute, Connecticut.  Brouwer, stop.  Here's Eddie, the guy that offered Patty the place.  Oh, cool.  Eddie.  Eddie.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, what's happening?  You're the guy.  Yeah, I'm retired trucker. 
[01:42:30]  You're not lying.  Oh, God.  What are you doing?  Is it a retarded trucker?  No, retired trucker.  He's loading up and trucking.  We're going to do what they say can be done.  Hey, Patty.  Hey, Patty.  Won't you hop up in the sleeper?  She'll have her own room with a TV and everything.  All right.  How old a gentleman are you?  Excuse me?  How old a gentleman are you?  I'm 44.  44?  You're retired?  How tall are you?  Yes, I put in my 20 years and I got out.  Bravo.  Are you married?  Separated. 
[01:43:00]  How tall are you?  I'm 5'11".  Dude, he says he's like 3'8".  Eddie?  Yeah.  Do you have any ulterior motives with Patty?  There's nothing...  Because my wife and daughter, we're trying to get back together and I would never ruin that.  Oh, so you're trying to hook back up with your family.  Yes, but I want to do this for Patty because I know what these shelters are.  Oh, you've been there?  No.  I have cousins on the 4th and they talk about them all the time.  Yeah. 
[01:43:30]  So, Patty, how long were you in there?  How long were you in that place?  No, I was never in the place.  Great.  You want a sock face?  Should I see your stinker?  I have to be a trucker.  You want a dry hump?  I worked out in New York City.  You do?  Yeah.  I got kids and everything.  So, you're not going to try anything.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  She'll have a safe good night's sleep.  What about things like access to a kitchen and bathroom? 
[01:44:00]  She has a kitchen.  There's a bathroom.  And her own TV?  Yep.  She has her own TV in the living room.  I'll stay in my daughter's room and watch my daughter's TV.  I'll keep the door open just to crack so I can play at my donkey and watch Patty go wee-wee in my bathroom.  This isn't the Yeti that does the mail here.  Yeti!  But she's more than welcome, you know, because I feel very sorry.  And I met her at the big-ass fight thing with Ron and Fez. 
[01:44:30]  And she was a very nice woman towards me.  Sounds like Arlene.  No, you're a trucker, though.  You were a trucker.  Yeah.  I worked for Airborne Overnight Courier.  Your daughter lives with you?  No.  But she sleeps over an awful lot.  No.  She's not allowed to anymore.  I got her a bathroom and everything.  That's why I figured I'd hook up Patty, you know?  Now, Eddie, Eddie, are you giving Patty your room? 
[01:45:00]  I'm giving Patty my bedroom.  Oh, my God.  And where are you going to sleep?  I'll sleep in my daughter's room.  But your daughter isn't there?  No.  Now, why don't you just give Patty your daughter's room?  Well, because I've been used to sleeping and...  Eddie, Eddie, say it.  Don't spray it.  I'm sorry.  Let me wipe that off.  Let me wipe it off your face.  Now, Eddie.  There's a little dribble underneath your eye.  Hold on.  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.  Why do you sleep in your daughter's room? 
[01:45:30]  Well, because I got the stereo there, and I got the TV there, and I got the DVD there.  So...  The DVD there.  Yeah, the DVD there.  I got my box of tissues right under where I need them, just in case a good channel comes on.  Because this week, I just got Bravo.  And once in a while, I have really good Bravo is on.  Then I got my tissues locked and loaded, and I'm ready to go.  It's a Patty.  You want to drive home?  I'm a trucker.  You're homeless.  Let's do it.  Hold on.  Let me go to my daughter's room. 
[01:46:00]  If you fold the corners of the pillow together, it sort of looks like a hiney.  Anthony.  Yeah, Eddie.  I think with all the crap I did all my life, maybe this will give me a gold star to get up to heaven.  You know?  You know something?  It might.  What's some of the crap you did in your life there, Eddie?  I don't even want to go through it.  Eddie, Eddie, this is like...  You know what our show is like?  Eddie, Eddie, where can we find the body?  Our show has given people salvation.  It's a place to vent. 
[01:46:30]  Eddie, give us one example of something that you would like this to maybe counteract in your life.  Give us one thing you did.  Murder.  Good night, everybody.  Are you there?  We're here, Eddie.  Okay.  Eddie?  Yes?  That's very noble now that maybe you want to take care of somebody. 
[01:47:00]  But that was an accident.  The guy was just going on and on about something.  I didn't like him.  So then he brought up again.  So I took my steak knife out and just lit him right in his face and his penis and right in his gut.  And then I danced in his blood and it's over and done with.  Eddie?  Yes?  Um, what?  That was a long time ago.  What?  That was the first one.  The second one was a lot sloppier.  Eddie, what happened?  How did you live with a murderer?  I could exactly right up.  Eddie, what happened? 
[01:47:30]  And how did you pay your debt to society?  A bad drug deal went down.  A drug deal went down.  So at the time, you were probably doing drugs, maybe.  No, I wasn't doing that.  I was just, uh...  I was there for security.  All right.  You were there for security for somebody that was dealing in drugs.  Yes.  And, uh, uh, I guess, uh, somebody tried to screw somebody over.  Right.  What happened was he gave them, he said he was going to give me some marijuana, right?  And I wanted him to press his kick.  So I said, all right, I'm going to drive down to Rockway and get some good marijuana. 
[01:48:00]  So I finished driving my truck.  I went down.  I bought a pot and it was ants in it.  It wasn't real marijuana, so I shot him.  And I'm satisfied.  We checked him out.  No, no, stop.  I'm captivating.  Eddie.  Yes.  So you're security for your buddy, right?  Yes.  Now, at the time, uh, are you a big guy, a big truck driver guy?  I'm 5'11", 240.  Well, were you armed in any way?  Yes.  Uh, with a firearm? 
[01:48:30]  Yes.  Uh, and what happened?  The deal went bad.  And, uh, I just went blazing.  You went blazing.  And you shot the other drug dealer guy?  Uh, both of them.  Wait, you shot the...  Wait, did you shoot...  The guy you were with?  No, I...  Oh.  You shot two drug dealer guys?  I shot the other two animals.  And, uh, did you hit...  And did you kill them both?  Yes.  So double murder.  Um, and, and what happened now?  How did this, uh...  How did this, like, play out in court? 
[01:49:00]  It never played out in court.  Why?  It never arose.  Wait a minute.  You never got caught?  No one, you never got caught.  I never got caught.  It was so simple.  I buried the two guys right on the...  You know where the swamp is in New Jersey?  Where the tollboos are?  They're both right there.  But people are so stupid.  What?  I put them there like two years ago.  I buried them.  It's easy.  Eddie.  Yes.  Hey, pal.  Um, Eddie, what happened with the bodies? 
[01:49:30]  I, uh, threw gasoline on and I burnt them.  All right.  So...  And they were, you know, they weren't, they were colored folks, so we don't need...  Were they black guys, Eddie?  Uh, I think they were Colombians.  Colombian, uh, drug guys, uh, killed and then, and then, uh, threw gas on them and burnt  them.  Yes.  What, uh, what year did this go down, Eddie?  Uh, 77.  Oh, so it was a long time ago.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, how old a guy are you? 
[01:50:00]  Forty, 44.  So you were...  I was just out of high school.  Just out of high school.  What happened with your buddy?  Uh, he's doing fine.  Yeah.  We still keep in touch.  You do?  You talk about old times?  Yeah.  Hey, remember those Colombians we barbecued?  It's like Tony Montana says, I don't like Colombians.  Now, now, uh, uh, Eddie, did they find these burnt-up shot Colombians?  No, because we went back the next day and we picked up all the pieces and we scattered 
[01:50:30]  them all over New York.  But where, where was it that it was so out of the way that no one noticed for a day?  East New York.  Eddie, are you lying?  No, I would not lie about something like this, Anthony.  I mean, I'm sweating like, sweating like hell right now.  Is this the first time you've discussed this?  Uh, uh...  To, uh, beside the priest, you, and my wife, that's about it.  Now, now, um, Eddie. 
[01:51:00]  Would you kiss me if I wear this scarf?  I fell for it!  He totally fell for it!  Eddie, is this the only thing in your life that...  I have, yes.  I ever did wrong, yes.  So after that, you, you went clean?  Yes.  Okay, terrific.  Um, I don't believe it.  I, I, I, I can't, the, the story's too amazing...  It is pretty.  ...to believe at face value, but then again...  Eddie.  Yes. 
[01:51:30]  Why?  I gotta ask you, I know, I, I, because I asked you, but why are you choosing this forum to confess  for double murder?  Well, I've been seeing the shrink, and, um, and she said I should talk about it and get  it off my shoulders.  Maybe it would help me.  So...  Eddie?  Yes?  You do realize there's no statute of limitations on murder. 
[01:52:00]  I know.  I don't give a crap.  And do, do you know that, that, that, confessing to a murder can open you up right now to, to  be arrested for it and then tried for it?  If they could find the body parts.  Well, well, um...  Did you see Scarface?  Remember when, when, I said, your womb is so polluted I can't even have a baby with you?  That's what I said to the stupid Dominican, and he put this dopey grin on his face, and  I shot him! 
[01:52:30]  It was hilarious.  First thing I want to do right now is, if you could please bring back in Patty.  I love that movie.  Hey, I think we gotta finally show responsibility for the first time on our radio show.  So this...  Eddie.  Yeah.  Serious.  You, um, you're absolutely telling the truth.  And Eddie, no one, no one's after you for doing this?  No.  Yeah, what happened, like, no one came after you and tried to, like...  They, they didn't think, uh, they only wanted him to go by himself, and I ended up, uh, being  the second guy inside, uh, an abandoned building with a long-range rifle, and I picked the guy 
[01:53:00]  off.  What, what, what happened that made you think, uh-oh, my friend's in danger, I gotta shoot  these guys?  Well, because I grew up with him, and I knew what kind of, I knew what kind of people these  are, they would shoot up, uh, 30 people to get one person.  So, so, you didn't, you didn't see any sign of danger, you just decided to take it upon  yourself to shoot the guys?  Yep.  And, um, hey, Patty? 
[01:53:30]  Yeah?  Patty's in the studio.  Hey, Patty, how you doing?  We got your new landlord on the phone.  We, uh, we checked him out, he seems fine.  Seems like a good enough guy, man.  You'll have a good time with, uh, Eddie, all right?  Okay.  When are you, uh, starting to live with him?  Oh, I don't know yet, I was just about to call him back.  Hey, Eddie, when can she, uh, move in with you?  She can come in tonight, if she wants.  How about tonight, Patty?  I'll start cleaning up the place a little.  What's there to clean up, Eddie?  Oh, I just got, uh, just papers on a phone.  Oh, okay.  And you've been married, and you have a child? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah, 23 years.  And, and your wife knows about this?  Uh, yeah.  And Patty knows where you live?  Yeah.  Patty?  In Queens.  Ah, Queens.  Yeah, I gave her the address.  Yeah.  All right.  There you go, Queens.  It's accessible on the N train, right?  M is the Michael.  Oh, the M.  Okay.  Eddie, Eddie.  Yes.  You're not worried that, that this information might lead to your arrest?  No.  Why aren't you worried about that?  Because they'll never find the part.  But, but, you know something?  Patty is confusing.  Oh, Patty, Patty, have you been listening to the show? 
[01:54:30]  I was on the phone.  Oh, geez.  I was listening.  All right.  Well, there's a little something about Eddie.  Just a little something, Patty.  We think he might have killed Bugs Bunny.  Do you like softball, Patty?  That's when you take human parts and you throw them up and you smack them and see him  how far they'll go in the river?  I'll show you, Patty.  Yeah?  You ever watch The Shining?  Patty?  Yeah?  God, Doc, I just grabbed his arm. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, I've seen The Shining.  Eddie, wait, wait.  Patty, when you see I'm working in here, Patty, stay the way from me.  Eddie?  Yes?  Why are you so confident that they're not going to find any of the body parts?  Yeah.  Because I know what I did with them and they'll never find them.  Like, what'd you do?  I put them in, you ever see the meat trucks that come by once every two weeks to pick up  the meat and the bones.  Oh, the big dumpster things that pick up the grease and the bones from the meatpacking 
[01:55:30]  district?  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen those.  I just saw one the other day.  It was disgusting.  Big lump of fat hanging out the back.  Wait, this really goes on?  Oh, yeah, the trucks down in the meatpacking district.  They're special waste removal trucks that take the grease and fat from the meatpacking district.  And the bones.  And the bones.  And, Eddie?  Yes?  How did you utilize that?  I divided them up into six bags and dropped the bag here, drop a bag there. 
[01:56:00]  All over the tri-state area or just Manhattan?  Inside the trucks.  And they get boiled and they make jello out of it.  That's something you don't expect to get is some jello.  Here's where the fun starts.  It's some Colombian-tasting jello.  Come here, try some, Rudy.  And there was no evidence left behind at the site where you killed the guys? 
[01:56:30]  Just blood.  Just blood.  And it was in a warehouse in East New York?  Yeah.  An abandoned warehouse.  An abandoned warehouse.  Well, there aren't many working ones there.  In East New York?  Yes.  You don't remember the street or nothing?  Off Pennsylvania Avenue.  Off Pennsylvania Avenue in East New York.  A warehouse.  Hmm.  And what was it like on the, uh...  It's probably still abandoned. 
[01:57:00]  You think it's still abandoned?  You ever drive by going,  Heh heh, that's where I took care of them Colombians.  Yeah, do you ever drive past there?  No, I don't even go towards that neighborhood anymore.  And, Eddie?  You're absolutely not effing with it.  Hey, Patty, this is the Eddie, right?  He's the same guy that you talked to about the place?  Uh...  She's white.  Look at her.  I'm not sure.  Is...  Are you?  Yes, I am, Patty.  Remember I told you I took the two pictures of the black guy next to you  and let's say... 
[01:57:30]  Let's make an Oreo cookie?  That you're the one I spoke to, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  You really killed somebody?  Two people, Patty.  Well, it was them or my friend.  Yeah, but...  Well, it doesn't sound like it.  It sounds like a deal was going down, Eddie.  And you took it upon yourself to shoot their heads off.  Yeah, but they were dirty Colombians.  Right.  I'll give you that.  Jesus.  Come on!  Patty?  How are you doing?  You feel all right?  You look a little pale.  Look at her face.  Patty, believe me, I am harmless.  Okay. 
[01:58:00]  Patty?  I can see you in the morning.  Say hello, my little friend.  Patty?  Patty?  Patty?  Patty, wake up.  Patty?  Patty?  Patty?  Patty?  Oh, hi.  Good morning.  You said you'd bring me down, you whore.  Patty?  Yeah?  It was years ago.  It was 1977.  I wonder if there's an unsolved crime from 1977 that happened in East New York. 
[01:58:30]  You never heard about any missing persons being followed for these guys?  Why would you talk freely about something like that?  Well, because Colombians don't even count as people, so what's the big deal?  Hey, Eddie.  Yeah?  This, no missing persons came from this, or?  I don't care.  I don't know.  Maybe they came right from Colombia.  Who the hell knows?  And it was in 1977.  Mm-hmm.  The year I graduated.  The year I graduated, I graduated in 76. 
[01:59:00]  And you know the guy that you did this with that's still around?  What's his first name?  I read it not.  Oh, yeah.  Don't give too many details.  You're right.  You're right, Eddie.  Don't go overboard now and tell them what caliber the weapon was.  Do you still keep a gun, Eddie?  I have six guns, all legal.  All legal.  Any handguns?  Yes, I do.  Oh, you're able to get a handgun license?  I guess that was from your truck.  My wife has a handgun license, too. 
[01:59:30]  And I think she should keep that updated.  Patty, right before I have orgasm, I'm going to stick my rifle in your balloon knot.  You ready?  Eddie, do you still have the murder weapon?  Excuse me?  Do you still have the murder weapon?  No.  No.  You got rid of that?  Yeah, I cut that up in pieces.  He's smart.  Where's that?  That's all over Brooklyn.  Interesting.  Hmm.  All right. 
[02:00:00]  So, Patty, are you going there tonight?  Patty, tonight you can move right in.  It's okay.  It was years ago, and it was only two Colombians that he blew their heads off, and he's only  got six guns.  Well, at least it's a short ride.  What do you have to go, like Astoria?  Yeah.  No, it's not Astoria.  It's called Ridgewood Queens.  It's on the M train.  The M train.  The M is in Michael.  There's no M train.  There's an M train in the Michael.  Hey, any other crimes you've committed?  No.  No, no, no.  No.  Hey, Perry, damn me to hell for mentioning that. 
[02:00:30]  I was more afraid of my friend losing his life.  That was the whole thing.  Right.  So, you were afraid that your friend would lose his life, and...  I was his backup.  And you were his backup.  He was in self-defense.  I said, hi.  I said, I'm Mike.  And you were a kid.  I said, I'm my friend, and they said, I'm Julio, and I'm Angelo.  The show is over.  There's a guy on Pennsylvania Avenue right now looking at abandoned buildings.  Well, he probably wouldn't find it, right, Eddie?  Hey, did they have guns and stuff?  Did they have weapons?  So, there's no evidence around at all, huh? 
[02:01:00]  No.  No.  Clean up?  We did a very thorough clean up.  Did they pull guns on you?  They pulled a gun on my friend, and that's when I took him out.  Some guy named Eduardo was saying you killed his brother.  Come on.  This guy, he killed my brother, man.  But Patty's more than...  She's more than, I don't know what the word to say. 
[02:01:30]  She's more than welcome to come here.  Hey, Eddie.  Yeah.  What month was that in, in 77?  It was the month of the son of Sam.  What, like the summer that son of Sam was?  Yep.  Remember a month like...  He killed his first victim in Forest Park, and this went down the following week.  So, the city was running around, you know, all screwed up. 
[02:02:00]  Right.  Were you a copycat murderer?  No, no, no.  No, he had a reason for it.  Not like son of Sam was a coof.  I just planned for it for the worst scenario.  So, you brought the rifle with you, and then your friend was supposed to be alone, so you  took up a position somewhere.  Right.  And, uh, when your friend met the other guys, you saw he was threatened, and you, uh, shot  two guys?  Yes.  Before they got a shot off?  Yes. 
[02:02:30]  Were you a Marine?  No.  Oh.  Just a good shot.  What kind of, uh, rifle was it?  I have an M1, an M1.  It was an M1?  Yes.  Semi-carbine.  Right.  Did they die quick?  I don't know, but we, we packed them up in bags, and we got them the hell out of there.  Where'd you burn them?  Where'd you find the bags?  So you passed them?  Yeah, you're not going to believe it, but there's two bags here.  Perfect.  Two bags. 
[02:03:00]  That's what you needed.  But where'd you burn them?  Uh, well, I'd rather not say.  Why not?  Because what if the, they might find a, uh, an inkling of something or other.  Ah, the forensics, they can't, uh, figure stuff out like that nowadays.  Not with plastic.  All right.  Cross Bay.  No.  Where?  Cross Bay, what?  In, in the marsh.  You know where the, the tall leaves and, uh, stems are? 
[02:03:30]  So you, you burnt the guy in the marsh?  Yeah.  Wow.  You burnt, uh, both of them in a marsh.  Mm-hmm.  In Cross Bay.  And then you collected up their, their, their goodies.  And then, uh, we took a ride around, uh, Manhattan, just flipping them out the window.  Put in bags?  But I thought you went to the meat truck.  I thought I was crazy when I went chicken wing throwing when I was, like, 17.  I saw some raw chicken wings. 
[02:04:00]  But, Eddie, your story's falling apart.  I thought you went to the meat truck.  Yeah, we went to the meat truck for the big pieces, but the smaller pieces, we were flipping  out the truck.  Out the car, I should say.  I think the guy's harmless.  No way.  Uh, I'm telling you.  He sounds good to me, Patty.  He sounds like a keeper.  At least he's not a bitch like that woman you were living with.  Who doesn't have a few ghosts in the closet?  Ah, you know something?  Right.  I mean, my brother once went into a, um, a stationary store right around the corner from  my grandmother's house. 
[02:04:30]  I think I was about eight.  My brother was nine or ten.  And loaded up our pockets with, uh, bubble gum.  And as we walked out, the guy said, hey, what's in your pockets?  You know what we did?  We ran.  We ran.  So, I, you know, Eddie, I understand you do certain things when you're younger, but  it doesn't make you a bad person, Patty.  He's very faithful with his friend.  Hey, uh, Eddie, Tom wants to talk to you.  Tom?  Okay.  And it sounds like he's sorry.  He does sound like he's sorry.  Yeah.  Tom?  Yes, Tom?  Tom, you're on the phone with Eddie, the, uh, the guy that has just confessed to, uh, 
[02:05:00]  murdering two people.  Hi, Tom.  Hi, Eddie.  How are you?  Okay.  Uh.  Are you a police officer?  Uh, yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh.  So, uh, how are you doing today, Eddie?  All right.  We're not feeling any funny, uh, funny facts telling the story?  No.  Okay, Eddie.  Eddie, could I ask you to come down somewhere for me?  No, sir.  No, sir, huh?  Okay.  Well, good talking to you, Eddie.  Thanks a lot. 
[02:05:30]  Thank you.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Eddie?  What?  What happens if you, if something happens now where the police, uh, want to ask you questions?  They have nothing to find.  Yeah, but.  What are you going to ask me?  Yeah, but they can, they can ask you a lot of questions.  They did already.  When?  About four years ago.  Why is that?  Why would they ask you?  Because, uh, this guy came up missing and they knew he was a friend of my friend and,  uh.  Oh, this was something else, Eddie? 
[02:06:00]  Yeah.  That your friend was involved in?  Yeah.  Were you involved in that?  No.  No, but, but they knew that, that you were his friend.  Yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  And was this guy murdered?  Uh, no.  No.  And was your friend, uh, responsible for it?  Uh.  For whatever did happen to this guy?  I, I, I really don't think so.  No.  I, I have no idea.  But you were brought in and they never brought up the two Colombian guys?  Nope.  Well, Eddie, are you, like, delusional? 
[02:06:30]  No.  No.  Someone.  I don't even take aspirin.  Someone is saying that there's no M1, uh, semi, uh, carbine.  There is an M1 carbine.  Yeah.  I'm just throwing stuff out there.  Standard issue a while back.  Well, Eddie, uh.  It was standard issue during World War II for the para-jumpers.  Yeah.  Very old, uh, rifle.  It's the Garand.  All right.  I gotta get going because I'm afraid.  Eddie.  Yes.  Hey, do me a favor, man.  Enough for nothing?  I could really make detective off of this one. 
[02:07:00]  She thinks.  Oh, that's genius.  God damn you, Tom.  That's funny.  I'll think about it on my deathbed.  That is genius.  All right.  Uh, well, what, you, you gotta go.  You're a little scared now, Eddie?  A little.  Maybe you said a little too much?  Yeah.  Well, a little.  Eddie, you, you do realize that odds are, let me just, I'm gonna put it this way to you.  So, odds are, someone's gonna be coming to talk to you.  I know that.  But I wouldn't worry.  I'd hang and, you know.  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  I'll, uh, and we'll get all baked out.  And grab a gun, start firing at the walls.  And I'll just give you a call.  All right.  We're giving, we're giving Patty, uh.  Play bongos naked.  We're giving Patty some money for, for a cab.  So, she'll be over in about now.  Yeah.  I'll be in music.  It's Fresh Pond Road Stop.  There you go.  All right.  Fresh Pond Road Stop off of the, uh, M train.  Hey, Pat.  M as in murder, Patty.  Michael.  Uh, Eddie?  Yes?  Just in case someone shows up at your door, can you call us real fast?  Sure.  All right.  All right.  All right, everyone.  That's it. 
[02:08:00]  All right.  Take it easy.  All right, Eddie.  You take care, Eddie.  I will.  Keep your hammer dry.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Eddie, you're not mad at us, right?  No.  No.  Of course not.  Good, good, good, good.  Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, Eddie, who's your pals?  O and A.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  All right, Eddie.  We'll talk to you soon, all right?  All right, bye.  Sooner than you think.  Okay.  And by the way, Eddie, thank you for staying on the phone until 520 and, uh, later, because  if that isn't a 520, then, dude, when he said murder, I fell down. 
[02:08:30]  I took my headphones off, threw them, and was like, no.  You fell down.  I really don't think he would hurt me.  No, Pat.  No.  Stop it.  Are you kidding me?  Pat, you go.  I bet you go, girl.  You go, girl.  I bet you he's a real good dancer.  I think the guy got all his aggression out.  He's funny.  It was back in 77.  77.  I mean, how, you know.  Letty.  It's like a long time ago.  A long time ago.  Right.  He's got a new life.  He's, uh, he seems responsible because he was able to retire at such an early age.  Dave, what's up? 
[02:09:00]  Hey, Dave, what's up, man?  Dave.  He's listening to the radio.  Go, Dave.  Last chance.  What's up?  What?  Dave.  Hey, ass monkey.  Don't make us, uh, send Eddie over your house.  Well, this part of the, uh, bit will be cut out when we do best of.  Thanks, Dave.  Bye.  Cut that part out.  Dave was going to say, uh, I'll never eat Jell-O again.  Yes.  Which I think a lot of people are thinking right now.  Wow.  Uh, all right.  We're going to break for a while.  For, uh, stinky.  I don't know.  We're going to have to, we're going to have to, uh, catch up a little bit. 
[02:09:30]  So we'll break for a little while.  And take a couple of calls that are on the line here, I see.  Yeah, we'll take a few calls.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Woo.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, who's up for Eddie Cribs?  I think we might be seeing that on tonight's news.  Yeah, we got to, uh, well, we have some phone calls to, uh, to take.  So why don't we take a break here, Anthony?  Why don't we, Opie?  Why don't we?  Eddie, if anyone shows up at your house, just give us a call, okay? 
[02:10:00]  Give us a little call.  All right.  You guys have, you guys have, you guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a vaudeville show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sorry about that, but we had to make up for some lost time.  Yeah, we, uh, didn't take a break for quite a while there. 
[02:10:30]  We did about an hour and a half of straight radio, so.  We're back with the Opie.  Wow.  The phones are going crazy.  We're trying to talk to everybody.  We're not blowing anyone off, trust me.  Darren, what's going on?  Oh, my God, guys.  Seriously, I don't know if that was a bit or not, but I just missed my goddamn flight because  of you guys.  No, no, seriously, like, you know what?  It's kind of ironic, though, that when, uh, President Reagan calls in, uh, Anthony's 
[02:11:00]  usually out of the studio.  Yeah.  When some psycho calls in, Norton's gone.  Oh, no, Norton's here.  Oh, no, Norton isn't here today, though.  Norton isn't here today.  Aw.  Darren, what I can tell you is this.  The guy is either very delusional or we just talked to a guy that, uh, admitted to murdering  two people.  Yeah.  That is it.  There's no pain.  Whatever it was, it was damn good radio.  That's for sure, boys.  We, um...  If that's Norton, he's beyond brilliant.  Yeah.  Beyond.  You missed your flight, though, Derek?  Yeah, me.  I was leaving out of Boston. 
[02:11:30]  I'm, you know, hitting traffic out there.  So, you know, I parked my car.  I got it on.  Totally lost track of time.  The next thing I look, I'm running inside.  They said it's too late, you know, for security, especially in Boston.  You can't do much.  Well, yeah.  But, hell, I didn't know it was worth it.  That's for sure.  All right.  Thank you, Derek.  Later.  Yeah, that cracked security down there at Logan Airport.  Day late and a dollar in two buildings short.  Bastards.  Our listeners are hilarious.  Iceman from Jersey.  How long before Andrew Gore has a picture of himself laying in the bed where Patty was  murdered in her sleep? 
[02:12:00]  Andrew.  Yeah, maybe Andrew knows this guy.  And then Keith from Highland.  Hey, I was wondering, does Eddie play softball?  You want him in the draft?  And then Errol from New Jersey.  I know who the son of Sam is.  It's effing Eddie.  Sam is his goddamn father.  M is for murder.  Eddie is stupid.  We're trying to call Eddie back.  Wow.  We're having no luck, though.  We have a weapons expert on the line.  You know, there might be people just tuning in, Anthony. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  You want to real fast?  Well, we were talking to stalker Patty.  Of course, she doesn't have a place to live.  She left the shelter because the conditions weren't to her liking.  And she was offered a place to live by this gentleman named Eddie.  And, um, Eddie called us up.  We spoke with him a little while.  And he said...  He's not very fun in Dominican.  Right.  He said for some reason he was letting Patty stay at the house.  And maybe it'll make up for some horrible things he did in the past. 
[02:13:00]  So we kind of egged him on a little.  And he told us what those horrible things were.  Double murder of two Colombian drug dealers back in 1977.  He, um...  He says that he was with his friend on a drug deal.  That was going bad.  That went bad.  And he shot two Colombians and killed them.  And they then, uh, put them in bags.  Took them to some marshland.  Burnt them.  Uh, put the remnants, uh, in a vehicle. 
[02:13:30]  Which they then threw the big pieces into, uh, uh, meat disposal trucks from the meat packing district.  And threw the little chunks just out the window.  All over Brooklyn.  As they drove around.  Cut the gun up.  And threw that, uh, all over the place.  And now they're headed back on the, uh, phone?  Yeah.  Uh, Crazy Eddie.  Eddie.  Hey, what's up?  Hey, how you doing there, pal?  Okay.  I was cleaning up the place with Patty.  What have you been doing?  Cleaning the place up with Patty.  Cleaning up? 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Something really funny happened, uh, during commercials.  You'll get a laugh out of this.  Anthony, uh, talk to stalker Patty.  Well, as I was passing by Patty to go to, uh, do, uh, even more production, uh, I said,  Hey, Patty, sleep tight.  Don't let the bed bugs bite.  And she, uh, it was completely white and pale and said, I think I'm going to look at some  other reaction.  She got a lock on the door.  She don't have to worry about it.  Now, Eddie, I got to tell you, a lot of people calling in saying you're a liar. 
[02:14:30]  Well, let them say I'm a liar, but I know the truth.  Right.  You know what happened.  And I'm going to hell for it, so.  Is that, are you, are you, like, very troubled by this over the years?  Has this really made you, uh, upset and?  Uh, well, uh, in a way, yes.  Have you talked to a psychiatrist about this?  I talked to a priest.  You talked to a priest?  Did he touch you where your bathing suit covers?  No, he did not.  Did he show you his donkey? 
[02:15:00]  No?  Okay.  But my doctor hooked me up with a psychiatrist next, uh, next month, uh, next week.  Next week.  You might miss that appointment, Eddie.  Do you smoke, uh, do you smoke the crack there, Eddie?  Nope.  I don't do no drugs.  Now, have you had a trouble in the past with drugs?  And I don't do no alcohol.  But did you, in the past?  Nope.  Never?  Nope.  Never?  You're on, you're on the truck driver?  And you're on no medication? 
[02:15:30]  Yep.  You are.  The only medication is, if the doctor signs for it.  Well, what's the medication you're on?  Well, I'm talking about, you know, golf a bit painkillers if I hurt my back or something like that.  Oh, they're like prescription medicine?  Yeah.  Prescription medicine.  That's about it.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Interesting.  Wow.  All right.  And no one has shown up, uh, to your place yet?  No.  Patty isn't there yet, huh?  Nope.  Any, any, any, do you have guilt about this, Eddie? 
[02:16:00]  Wait, Patty's crying.  Why?  Get Patty in here immediately.  As she weeps.  Patty, come here.  Get in here, Patty.  Patty, come here.  Get her in here.  Drag her in.  Drag her in by her goddamn joint hair.  And we gotta talk to Ron, because this is a regular caller on Ron and Fez, and he's really pissed off that the guy has decided to confess murder on our show instead of his.  Patty, why are you crying?  Right.  Patty, what's wrong?  I want to go to, if I'm going to be with somebody, it's got to be a safe person.  I don't want to.  It will be safe, Patty. 
[02:16:30]  My mother lives upstairs.  Wait, wait, wait.  I'm sorry.  Wait, wait.  Let Patty talk to Eddie the murderer.  No, no.  I don't want to.  Patty, Patty, talk to Eddie and see what kind of guy he is.  See if it's the type of place.  I have a better idea.  What?  What's your idea?  What are your options?  You don't have any.  Stay with Eddie.  No, I have a better, safer option.  You're being prejudiced against murderers, Patty.  Patty, why are you crying?  Sorry, I'm going to pass Patty.  Patty, no.  Hold Patty up.  Patty, why are you crying?  Hold Patty up.  She's going to pass out. 
[02:17:00]  Patty.  Why are you crying?  Why are you crying?  Because I'm afraid of what I heard.  Patty, my mother lives upstairs.  Patty, you're not a drug dealer.  It's him and a wig.  Anthony.  Yes.  No.  Tell her my mother lives right above me.  Patty, the mother, just like Norman Bates, his mother lives upstairs.  She's not alive anymore, but she lives above him.  Patty, his mother lives there.  She's alive.  You're fine.  You're safe.  And you don't shower anyway. 
[02:17:30]  Yes, I do.  Patty, you're safe.  You would rather stay in an East New York shelter?  No, but I had another idea.  What's your idea?  You're going to shack up with Charlie Manson?  No.  I looked up someplace uptown on Amsterdam Avenue.  It's called the Utah School.  Let's not give out.  $29 a night.  Now he knows.  I know.  Now he knows.  No, but if I get, like, an advance from that $906, I can buy a week in a safe place. 
[02:18:00]  Now we're shelling money out.  In a safer place where I don't have to worry.  $99 a night?  No, no, no.  It's only $29 a night.  Well, that's going to run out real quick, Patty.  But I could probably, it'll be a place to base myself.  Eddie, could you just talk Patty into staying with you?  Patty, there is nothing, believe me, on my daughter's life, there will be no problem. 
[02:18:30]  And Eddie, where can we find your daughter?  My daughter lives out on Long Island.  All right, out on Long Island.  Okay.  All right, that's good.  So, Patty, doesn't he sound like a nice guy?  But it scared me.  This happened 20-something years ago, Patty.  I've been in straight and narrow since then.  What if she slept with a gun on her chest?  I'll give her one to sleep with a gun on her chest. 
[02:19:00]  Patty, how about that?  You could sleep armed.  I just want to feel absolutely safe.  You'll be safe.  You'll have a lock on your own door.  You have your own bathroom.  You have your own TV room.  Just don't mention Alexa Hente and his coffee.  He has a thing about a Colombian.  I don't make coffee because I don't drink it.  Right, because I have a Colombian.  We've been screening all the future landlords, and this is the best one we got for you.  The other ones were really bad.  Patty, this guy sounds all right. 
[02:19:30]  I mean, I'll even cook for her.  Uh-oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  You did a good job.  You did a good job 20-some-odd years ago cooking those Colombians.  All right, hold on.  Maria's on the line.  Maria.  Maria.  Hey.  Hey.  You know, I lost my husband about 24 years ago.  He went out for a pack of cigarettes, and he never came back.  Are you kidding?  No, I am kidding.  Yeah, you bitch.  You bitch.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, Patty, why don't you think it over a little bit?  I just want to make sure that I'm okay. 
[02:20:00]  She'll be safe.  She could call the radio station every hour on the hour if she wants.  And, Patty, it's not like we'd be losing Mother Teresa here.  It's you.  And, Patty, I...  No one really cares.  I have a feeling you're going to have the house to yourself tonight.  Yeah.  Uh, Ed?  Yeah?  Would you allow Patty to live there if you were, let's say, away?  While you're trying to figure out bail?  I don't think, uh, there is any, uh, anything going on with the bail. 
[02:20:30]  That's all right, Colombo.  It ain't going to stick, Eddie.  Right.  I'm with you, brother.  Everybody's got a body somewhere in their past.  Right.  Hey, Ron.  This guy calls your show all the time?  Yeah.  He's a nice listener.  Yeah, I always call Ron and Fed.  They're great guys.  Yeah, great guys.  Why don't you Billy Stink?  I can't remember that.  Eddie, why couldn't you throw them the bone in there?  Oh, my God.  You confessed to murder.  You are so.  Yeah, why can't I be on the front page of the Post tomorrow, you son of a bitch?  Because Al Dukes always hangs on the phone. 
[02:21:00]  Al Dukes!  Al Dukes!  I know the reason I hate Al Dukes.  Oh, he got a phone call.  Eddie, you know, Ron and Fed could have used a little help.  No kidding.  But Al Dukes always hangs up on me.  You know, is the happy end of the story?  No one really brought up that he got the money and the product at the end?  There was no money or product.  That's why I felt I had to go with it.  You had to drop them.  Yeah.  Sure.  They were screwing you.  Yeah, I was laughing.  They were going to do my friend, and there was no money or product. 
[02:21:30]  That's what the whole thing was.  Hey, Patty.  Hi, it's O.J.  You want to stay and watch my kids?  Patty?  Is Patty on the line?  Yeah, Patty's here.  Patty, listen.  There will be nothing happening to you tonight, tomorrow night, the next night.  You know, you can stay as long as you want.  You have to run in the house.  Yeah.  You just got to knock on the bathroom.  So, you know, if I'm in there or not.  Hey, Patty, it's Robert Blake. 
[02:22:00]  I'm vouching for this guy.  You can go in the refrigerator.  You can go in the freezer.  You can cook your own meals if you want.  Patty, you and Eddie, about 9 o'clock tonight, will be playing hand puppets with Colombian heads.  Oh, my gosh.  You'll have your own pit with your own bottle of lotion.  Go into the freezer right behind the wrapped-up feet.  You can find some TV dinner.  No, there's nothing to add up here.  Anthony, I got some audio of Eddie later tonight.  Oh.  Yeah, Fez reminded me of something.  It rubs the lotion on its skin.  It does this whenever it's told. 
[02:22:30]  No, but you'll be safe here.  You're safe.  Hey, when Eddie does it.  You'll be safe here.  Eddie, when you tuck that thing between your legs, you look like a pretty girl.  You really do.  I do, you.  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again.  It rubs gas.  I even put fresh sheets on the bed for her.  Oh, my God.  See?  And tarps on the floor.  Anthony, I have a question.  What's taking them so long?  This is Susudio. 
[02:23:00]  What's taking them so long?  We only got 40 minutes left in the show.  Hey, maybe we could have a little cross-promotion.  And have the arrest live on Ron and Fez.  You know what?  I say, put the refrigerator up against the door.  Shoot the windows out and hold them off, brother.  Stay on the phone with me and Fez.  We're with you the whole way.  Well, if she decides to come here, she's more than welcome.  Patty.  Patty, come on. 
[02:23:30]  The guy sounds fine.  It just frightens me.  He's fine now.  What are you going to be scared?  Bada beep, bada boop.  He shot a few guys.  He sounds horrible.  Patty, what if one of those, your two friends, what would you have done?  What?  Think about it.  They were Colombians.  I just never killed anybody in my life.  Well, now you could study under a master.  No, it's just...  There's always a first for everything.  Patty, what's there to be scared of?  Why are you scared?  He sounds like a nice guy. 
[02:24:00]  It just freaked me out, though.  I'm not...  He's not going to hurt you.  You're his squeaky from.  Right.  He loves you.  Exactly, see?  As a matter of fact, I got you a picture of...  She only has the haircut.  I put my mirror with the two black guys at the big-ass fight night.  Yeah, another one coming up Friday.  Thanks a lot, Eddie.  Yeah, Friday night.  There you go.  Everybody in the room feels it would be okay.  Sure.  Sure would be.  Patty, don't worry about it.  You're so safe. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah, you'll be fine.  Eddie, we're going to send Patty over there.  All right.  It's the M train.  Patty, do you trust us, right?  Yes, I do.  Who thinks that we shouldn't send Patty over to Eddie's house?  Anyone in the room?  See?  No one.  See?  He sounds like a nice enough guy.  We've hung out with him at the Ron and Fez event last time.  Use your head.  Use your head.  All right, so we'll send you there in a cab in a little while.  All right.  With some Jell-O.  And that'll be there waiting in clown makeup.  Hey, Eddie.  It'll be fun.  Yeah. 
[02:25:00]  Eddie, do you play softball?  Yeah, I do.  Do you?  You want to be on our softball, one of our softball teams?  When you get out.  All right.  Don't turn on the space.  What do you say?  Your team's going to be the Yankees again, like the pinstripes?  I'll trade you.  Eddie's stripes will be close enough.  I'll trade you Joel Rifkin, who's going to be on my team.  All right.  All right.  I got Amy Fisher.  Hey, Eddie.  Yeah.  Look out your window right now. 
[02:25:30]  Anything going on?  Hold on.  What do you see?  Does it look quiet out there?  Hold on for a minute.  Wait a minute.  The phone.  Let me get the...  Uh-oh.  Take a look.  Let me get the thing untangled.  Just give me a second.  Crawl on the floor.  Yeah.  Stay low.  I got body-proof vests.  Beautiful.  I got body armor.  You wear a bullet-proof vest?  Yeah.  Why?  My cousin gave it to me.  He's on the force.  Oh, Jesus.  Greg.  Another embarrassment. 
[02:26:00]  Did you tell your cousin about this little faux pas?  Yeah.  Really?  Nothing out there.  Nothing out there.  It's true.  He's got a point.  What?  What's wrong with you, bro?  Yeah, so what time should I expect a stalker, Patty?  About 9.30?  Yeah.  What time, Patty?  You want to leave now, Patty?  Patty?  Whenever you...  Okay, I'll go. 
[02:26:30]  Whenever you send me.  We're going to get a wire on.  All right?  All right.  We're going to send Patty to Eddie's house.  All right.  Everything seems to be on the up and up.  She can call you as soon as she gets in the door.  All right.  All right, Patty?  Okay.  Have her do that.  All right.  Yeah, you have no problem with this, right, Patty?  No, it just scared me.  No, you're just fine.  You're being silly.  I cover my eyes when I watch TV sometimes.  He's fine.  Wow.  Sure.  Well, this is real life.  Don't worry.  It's not TV.  That ain't going to help you here, honey. 
[02:27:00]  I bet the TV does it back.  You just cover your eyes.  It goes right through your hands.  Face.  Gun shots sound a lot different in the real world, too, by the way.  It doesn't sound like that.  Plus, Patty, there's always a citizen's arrest if you need to.  Citizen's arrest.  You run to arrest, you have the right to remain silent.  It's Police Woman with Stalker Patty.  She's pepper.  Yeah.  Cagney and lazy. 
[02:27:30]  We are in this little hat.  Oh, yeah.  Well, Patty, I am looking forward to hearing about your little night with Eddie.  Okay.  All right, let me send her pokebats for her, okay?  What's that?  Let me set up her bed, give her a nice clean linen, then a pillow, and a blanket.  All right.  See that?  See?  He's going to be all nice to you, Patty.  My bunny rabbit's tonight.  And you can lock the door.  There's a lock on the door. 
[02:28:00]  Do you have a key for it?  No.  Patty, you got your bunny rabbit?  Yeah.  Okay.  And I'll even give her a flashlight in case she has to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night so she can see.  That's great.  That way she can see in the coffin.  Something for him to take a beat on, the flashlight in the dark.  All right.  You take it easy, guys.  Oh.  Eddie, where are you going?  All right, Eddie.  We were just going to...  Well, I was going to start getting this stuff ready for Patty.  Oh.  All right.  We might call you back in a little while.  Okay.  All right.  And Eddie, Eddie. 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  The second you hear anything like a knock on the door or a bell ringing or a bullhorn outside, anything like that.  Or a helicopter hovering.  Right, right.  Right.  Please, before you answer the door or do anything, you make sure you call.  And get my arm.  Well, call us first.  Okay.  All right?  All right.  And if the NYPD is listening, if you love the Opie and Anthony show, you would make sure this happens before 7 o'clock.  Thank you.  Although, you know.  If not, we're still on the air to 11. 
[02:29:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Eddie will be doing...  I'll do the right thing for Ron and Fez.  Thank you very much.  Thank you, Eddie.  Okay.  Eddie will be doing traffic and weather for us updates.  All right.  Let's go to her after, Eddie.  Any problems over there?  All right.  Oh, my God.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  There it goes, Eddie.  Okay.  We better take another break in.  All righty.  Eddie.  We'll try to take a short break and come back.  Opie.  And for me.  Their psychosis is all real. 
[02:29:30]  This is not an act.  Ponderous.  Effin' ponderous.  Tick, tick.  The Opie and Anthony show.  Well, I want to thank Jim Brewer for stopping by today.  What a blast.  We got nothing accomplished today.  That's all right.  We actually, we did.  We absolutely did.  Come to a complete halt.  We got accomplished.  A great tribute to Ted Knight.  Remember the beginning of the show?  That's right.  What a great tribute we did to Ted Knight.  Debbie's checking in, Anthony. 
[02:30:00]  The phones are going nuts.  Yeah.  Debbie, what's going on?  Well, I went to C.  Hall.  I'm with criminal justice and political science.  And that guy, he tells a really good tale.  He should write a book because he could be a millionaire.  But I'm disputing everything he said.  What?  What, Debbie?  I'm disputing everything he said.  Because all you need, basically, is probable cause for a conviction.  But I don't think Eddie knows that.  Yeah.  Eddie just assumes you get rid of the evidence and the weapon.  Right. 
[02:30:30]  You're home free.  You're home free.  Well, the other thing that I find kind of hard to believe is that, you know,  he said someone, his cousin or whatever, the cop, didn't he say that?  Yeah, he did say that.  Well, then the cop would have told him, you know, keep your mouth shut.  Well, the cop should have said something.  Well, if he's told him, you're my blood, you're my cousin, so I'm not ratting you out,  then he would have just said, you know, keep your mouth shut forever.  I said it earlier.  There's two things that is going on here.  He's either very delusional or it really went down. 
[02:31:00]  Well, if it did, then, because you can check the history books, Encyclopedia Britannica Online,  I don't know where, but Marsha Clark got a conviction without a body.  It happens every so often.  All right, we'll see how this one plays out, all right?  All righty.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Hey, I learned that this is not TV.  This is ONA.  Yeah, very good.  I didn't know we were playing what we learned today. 
[02:31:30]  All right.  Sailor Bob, what's up?  Yo, man.  Hey.  Everybody's missing the point here.  This guy is a hero.  What is it that he did that's so bad?  He eliminated a couple of Colombian drug dealers from our streets.  Hey, I don't think the cops should show up.  Let's all go there and pin a medal on his chest.  Well, there you go.  Another man's opinion.  All right, thank you, Sailor Bob.  You guys suck.  The phones have exploded.  Will, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  This is Will from Ridgewood.  Yeah.  What's going on, bro?  Hey.  Dude, I got to know where exactly should I be to catch this action later tonight. 
[02:32:00]  Dude, I'm right on Fresh Pond Road.  I'm a block away from Fresh Pond Road and the train station.  Did he say Fresh Pond Road?  He said that's the train station.  He said Fresh Pond Road.  He said Fresh Pond Road.  Oh, here's Eddie back on the phone.  Eddie.  Let's hear it, Eddie.  Eddie.  Hey, what's up?  How you doing there?  Okay.  Yeah.  Eddie, well, Will wants to know exactly where you live, but that would be...  One block from the train station.  Yeah, I know.  By the New Corrado, so should I go through the bus?  Yeah, right.  Right by the New Corrado and the bus depot.  Oh, right by the bus depot? 
[02:32:30]  Like right above the bar?  Well, I live one block over on Woodbine.  Oh, on Woodbine.  I live on Madison.  No, no, no, no.  No, I live on Madison.  He lives on Madison.  He lives on Woodbine, dude.  Woodbine and 64th or Woodbine and Freshbine?  Between Freshbine and 64th.  Oh, okay, okay.  I know exactly, we're like towards the private houses or...  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay, okay.  Well, right around the corner, that's not bad.  That's not bad.  We're pretty close, bro.  Well, there you go, Will. 
[02:33:00]  Have fun.  All right, so I'll be looking out my window tonight, fellas.  There you go.  All right.  All right.  Thanks a lot, fellas.  Okay.  Eddie, if this is some wacky radio thing...  You gotta do it, aren't you?  What the hell is that?  That's Will all excited because he knows where the guy lives.  Let me get Eddie back.  Eddie.  Yes.  If this is some wacky radio thing, you better say it now, man.  Why?  Huh?  Why?  I don't know.  Well, I don't...  Just should.  Clear the air. 
[02:33:30]  You might have some crazy Colombians sitting on your porch.  Why, you think the police will be coming?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  He's got a wow stick.  Do you have one of those Opie and Anthony wow shirts?  Yeah, I do.  Put one of those on.  Yeah.  And I got a sports guy's t-shirt, too.  No, no, no.  But the...  Oh, no, dude, dude.  You gotta put the wow shirt on right now.  Okay.  All right?  Yeah.  You promise? 
[02:34:00]  Yep.  I'll change right now.  Okay.  All right.  Good.  Why are they yelling and screaming outside the studio?  Just make sure you put that wow shirt on.  That's very important.  Okay.  And Patty's on her way, by the way.  Yeah.  Okay, cool.  Nice.  All right.  I'll make her a hot meal and everything.  All right.  You're gonna have a little company tonight.  Yeah.  Before I go in this flammer.  Well, nah.  You already said they can't catch you?  Yeah.  I don't think so.  I think you're pretty clean there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I think you're off the hook.  Well, I'll call you tomorrow.  I'll let you know. 
[02:34:30]  Well, you only get one phone call tomorrow.  Yeah.  Well, if I'm not in the pen, I could call you, you know what I'm saying?  What?  I didn't get that one.  You could call us, what, anyway?  Yeah.  Oh.  You don't mind?  No.  Not at all.  Okay, bro.  Patty be safe, believe me.  Patty will be fine.  Yeah.  That was a lot of years ago, right?  Yeah.  Tell you how to win.  Patty will be safe.  She has her own lock and everything.  Eddie, did you hit him in the head? 
[02:35:00]  Yeah.  You got head shots on him?  Yeah, I got a head shot and a shoulder shot.  And then what happened with the shoulder shot?  The shoulder shot first, then when the guy turned around on the floor, then I hit him with the head shot.  Were the two guys right next to each other?  Yeah.  So how did the other guy not shoot your friend?  He just...  Well, start running.  He took off.  And he was shooting crazy, and I just picked him off.  I was, you know, I was composed. 
[02:35:30]  You got him in the shoulder, he fell down, and then you just got him in the head?  Yeah.  Wow, good shooting.  And then how did you get the other guy?  Yeah.  In the belly.  Wouldn't he be running?  Wait, you got one guy in the head and the shoulder.  Right.  And the other guy in the belly?  He was taking off, and I hit him in the back, and he got it in the belly.  It was through a back shot.  So it went right through him?  Yeah.  And did that kill him, or did you have to finish him off?  No, I had to go back and put another round in him. 
[02:36:00]  Pang, pang.  So you got him in the head?  Yeah.  All right.  At least you finished.  Patty?  And you just happen to have bags?  At least you finished when he started.  Don't worry, Patty.  I'll make you scramble eggs and bacon.  Don't worry.  This happened over 20-something years ago.  Where did you get the bags that you put them in?  Yeah, that's a silly phrase.  Where did you get the bags?  Where did you get them?  I work for an air freight company, so...  You just hang out with bags in your truck?  But did you have to go get the bags?  You guys want some bags? 
[02:36:30]  We had our own bags.  But did you have to go get bags, or did you have them?  No, I can ask for them any time I need them.  I got hefty bags.  Yeah, but did you...  If you didn't think you were going to kill these guys right when you got there, why did  you have bags with you?  Just in case.  Well, I got the little white spray.  Oh, just in case you had to kill them.  Yeah.  Just in case.  So you were thinking, maybe I'm going to kill these guys.  Yeah.  Going into it, right?  Yeah.  I had a list of everything that I had done.  Well, that would make sense, the bags in, of course.  Yeah.  That's smart, man. 
[02:37:00]  Yeah, it is smart.  So you don't just think, man, I'm going to take a gun and kill them.  You think, if I kill them, I'm going to have to clean up the mess.  If I do, and I got a place to build them.  And I even had...  You're smart, bro.  Uh, what do you call it?  That, uh, stay puff, uh, liquid stuff.  What the hell is that?  You know, the stuff you put after the wash to make the fluffy stuff?  Because that, uh, that helps, uh, save the...  Breaks up the blood or something?  Yeah, exactly.  Right.  Yeah.  I bought a half gallon of that. 
[02:37:30]  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are you thinking?  Hmm.  Yeah.  What?  He's thinking.  Good job.  All right.  I'll call you tomorrow.  Oh, don't cut a few details.  I like hanging.  Seems to have all the details.  Yeah.  Totally fascinating.  Boy, do you have nightmares about this?  No.  Did you throw the bodies in the trunk of your car?  In the trunk of his car.  And then you drove it to the marsh.  And, uh, we hacked them up.  What kind of car were they driving?  What?  Now, where's that car? 
[02:38:00]  Colombians, what kind of car are they driving?  The car we were driving?  Yeah.  What did you do with that?  How did the Colombians get there?  And what happened to their vehicle?  They, they, they lived in the neighborhood over there.  Oh, they were local Colombians.  Yeah, they were local.  And what, whatever happened to this car?  It was burnt.  You didn't burn a car.  Yep, we did.  Now, where's that?  Cross Bay.  How do you burn a car?  You just burnt the car. 
[02:38:30]  It's easy.  All you do is take a knife, cut the seats, take a Brillo pad, throw some rubbing alcohol,  and poof.  Yeah, but didn't they have to put the fire out, Eddie?  Yeah, at the time the fire engines came, there was nothing left of the car.  People torch cars all the time.  Yeah.  We took the plates off and everything.  So, there was nothing left of the car anyway.  And they didn't tie the, uh...  They probably didn't find the body.  They figured it was stolen anyway.  Yeah.  And put, put that to Goomba area anyway. 
[02:39:00]  Hey, Joey.  Goomba.  Hey, where do you catch your balls, tell me?  Goomba's in his car.  Can I be on your softball team, man, if I don't get locked up?  Goomba's come out of the woodwork.  Hold on.  So, no one came to your house?  Because, I mean, there's got to be other ways to get numbers off a car.  Well, there's been a number.  Nobody came to my house.  Nobody ever came to my house.  If they never tied the car to a murder because they never knew about a murder, it's just another abandoned vehicle that was torqued. 
[02:39:30]  Exactly.  You were totally smart.  You know, who knows?  Well, interesting.  Never got in trouble before, so I had a, you know, clean record.  What does that have to do with anything?  Just like cheesecake.  Well, that helps a little bit.  All right.  All right, Eddie.  All right.  Well, you made for an interesting afternoon there.  Well, you certainly did.  Thanks for the entertainment.  I'll wait for Stalker Patty.  Yeah, she should be showing up any minute now.  All right.  Let me put her supper on the fire. 
[02:40:00]  All right, guys.  You take it easy.  Do you feel better that you confessed today there, Eddie?  A little bit, yeah.  To friends.  Yeah.  But you're now, you're a little nervous, though, now, right?  A little bit nervous.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  It's all right.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Worst comes the worst.  If a cop knocks on the door, I'll take about 18 Xanax.  That should knock me down.  That would do it.  All right.  Yeah.  Okay, dude.  You take it easy, and I love you guys. 
[02:40:30]  Well, well, Eddie, that's a strong word to use.  You take care, too.  I will.  Eddie, could you say your mom's box?  My mom's box.  No, no, no.  Say your mom's box.  Oh, your mom's box.  It's Eddie, everyone.  There.  Make sure.  There you go.  Very, very good.  Famous last words of this show.  Your mom's box.  Can we have Patty say it, too?  Your mom's box.  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, there you go.  Ron and Fez, we're up next here in New York. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  How you doing, guys?  We got some good news.  Billy Staples has offered to sleep over with Stalker Patty.  Oh, Jesus.  As a date.  He will be her sleepover companion at Eddie's home.  Oh, is that how you're going to work it?  Billy, are you going to Eddie's house?  What?  Is this a story?  I don't know.  Billy is a trained security professional.  We're not trying to jump into your gimmick.  What are you saying? 
[02:41:30]  How about if Billy wears an Opie and Anthony shirt on the front and a Ron and Fez shirt on the back?  I'll put a wild shirt on him if you got one.  It fits.  If he shoots you, if he shoots you, you have to fall in the direction of the show's going on.  Are you really having Billy go over to Eddie's house?  Fez, do you remember at one time when Opie actually pulled that shirt off Billy Staples like it was the branded TV show?  Tearing his stripes off of him.  All but one man died.  Down at Branded Creek.  Branded a coward man.  Billy, you really going over there? 
[02:42:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  Someone's got to be there to protect Patty.  Yeah.  Remember, Billy doesn't have any place to sleep either.  Yeah, true.  Our only other option is to put him in a wig, glasses, and a cast of pretendies, Dr. Patty.  Double homicide.  Like Sylvester Stallone did in that movie, uh, uh, uh, no.  Stop or My Mom will Shoot?  Uh, Hawke, uh, Nighthawk.  Oh, Nighthawk.  Nighthawk, yeah.  That's where he was also trapped on the Roosevelt Island tram.  Yeah, there you go.  Who can forget that?  They thought it was the bionic woman, but it was Sylvester Stallone in the wig, right? 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  What a relief.  What a relief.  That was so believable how they filmed that scene.  Oh.  Well, Ronifaz up next to New York, and it looks like they're going to have a hell of a show tonight.  We got a murder plan from 7 to 11.  Please, whatever you do, do not turn off your radio tonight.  It's too important.  That's right. 
[02:43:00]  A life may just depend upon it.  Listen.  Billy, I would get over there soon.  Yeah.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Oh, I plan, Eddie and I are like this.  Two fingers wrapped around each other.  Oh, really?  Me and Eddie are tight.  You weren't the, uh, friend that he was naming.  Were you the other man on the scene?  I was around in 77, but I have no knowledge of that incident.  No, you don't remember that?  Maybe you were blacked out.  A little alcohol.  That's a good possibility.  It was the 70s.  It's the same thing he says about the 80s, the 90s, and today. 
[02:43:30]  Billy drugged out through most of the 70s, 80s, and 90s.  All right, we got to go.  Yes, we do.  What a treat for everyone in New York.  Ronifaz up next. </pre>
