<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts, Opie and Anthony, and Jim Norton engaging in their signature brand of crude and vulgar banter, filled with sexually explicit jokes and fart humor.  They then transitioned to a discussion of the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary about John Spano's fraudulent purchase of the New York Islanders, detailing his scheme, arrest, and the Islanders' logo.  This was followed by a discussion of the documentary "Life According to Sam," focusing on a child with progeria, the emotional impact of the film, and the frustrations surrounding the FDA approval process for potential treatments.  Listener calls followed, including discussions about the progeria documentary and pranks targeting sports radio host Mike Francesa, with clips of the pranks played on air.  Upcoming guests Neil deGrasse Tyson and Tammy Pescatelli were briefly mentioned.

A significant portion of the show was dedicated to a discussion about the scientific inaccuracies of the movie *Gravity*, featuring a guest astrophysicist (implied to be Neil deGrasse Tyson).  The conversation covered various aspects of the film's depiction of zero gravity, including Sandra Bullock's hair, the implausibility of a doctor repairing the Hubble telescope, and the astronauts' lack of realistic camaraderie.  The discussion expanded into a physics lesson on angular momentum, the Higgs boson, the limitations of human understanding of the universe, and the possibility of tachyons. The guest shared anecdotes about Neil deGrasse Tyson, his podcast *StarTalk*, his views on death, the age of the Earth, religion, and science,  and answered listener questions about space and physics.  The segment also touched upon asteroids, comets, Voyager probes, and the potential for extraterrestrial life.

A lengthy interview with Neil deGrasse Tyson followed.  They discussed learning, the instinct to suck, the expanding perimeter of ignorance, and the connection between learning about the universe and learning an instrument, referencing a Gary Larson/Ziggy cartoon.  Tyson compared learning mathematics to learning a language, highlighting its logical structure and its role in understanding the universe.  He touched upon the creative aspects of mathematics and writing, using *Inception* as an example (though initially misidentified), and mentioned Isaac Newton's invention of calculus.  The interview concluded with Tyson promoting his *StarTalk* live podcast with Eugene Mirman.

The hosts then contrasted the Tyson interview with their upcoming guest, Tammy Pescatelli, highlighting her "horrendous accent" and "guinea jokes." Opie discussed his upcoming extensive and expensive dental work.  Pescatelli then joined the show, recounting a subway encounter with a harassing man, discussing motherhood, her dislike of some other mothers, children's shows, UFC, and Jenny Hutt.  Her conversation included anecdotes about her comedy career, balancing motherhood, and audience interactions, a humorous story about a homeless man named "Tippy Tom," and her past struggles with porn addiction.

Ron Howard joined the show next, discussing his work, including *Heart of the Sea* and *Project Imagination*, filmmaking techniques, technological advancements, and the importance of story and character. He shared anecdotes about working with Tom Hanks.  This was followed by an interview with John McEnroe, who primarily discussed his short-lived CNBC talk show, the challenges of hosting, securing guests (including Elton John), network interference, and encounters with other talk show hosts like David Letterman. He promoted his Dove Men+Care campaign, discussed his life in New York City, his tennis career (including the documentary *Fire and Ice*, Bjorn Borg, and the alleged Bobby Riggs/Billy Jean King match-fixing scandal), his family, and his regret about not having more time for his wife's musical career. He also shared a personal anecdote about a priest arrested for child molestation. Tammy Pescatelli briefly reappeared to promote her Netflix special.  The segment concluded with commercial breaks, a gift-giving discussion with Steven Singer, Russell Peters' Netflix special, and a lengthy, vulgar conversation with Jenny Hutt.  This conversation covered Hutt's work at CNN, personal life, her childhood molestation, race, crime statistics, NAMBLA, and various other topics, including her physical appearance, sexual experiences, and opinions on current events.


A final segment focused heavily on Anthony Cumia's recent dental work, including jokes about a dental assistant. The conversation included dismissive comments about Kwanzaa, further discussion of Jenny Hutt's appearance and past promiscuity (including detailed, vulgar jokes about her pubic hair and laser hair removal), celebrity gossip about Jenny Hudson, Snooki (including comments on her episiotomy), Paulie D (and his child with a woman described with offensive language), and Jenna Jameson.  A commercial for Russell Peters' Netflix special was played, and the hosts discussed engagement rings and marital relations, interjecting sexually explicit jokes, frequently referencing Jenny Hutt's sexual experiences.  The segment concluded with extensive use of crude and offensive language.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning, I'm Christopher Lloyd and I'm standing here at the studios of Sirius XM Satellite Radio.  It's a weekly morning, approximately 6 a.m. and this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar. 
[00:00:30]  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot, do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it sounded.  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow, thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  It's not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Point simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  O&A every day, that's what I say.  You guys having a good time or what? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed and conventions burn the crowd.  Would you like to make some of the pizza again?  Wow!  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Betty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  That doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony, the rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you want to invite these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to hell.  Fuck you!  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender. 
[00:01:30]  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horns should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double gun, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Ah, good morning everyone.  Hi.  Hello.  Time for another radio show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  We got a busy day, too.  Very, very busy day.  Ball.  Kind of bummed.  I thought you would have seen the John Spano thing by now.  No, I heard about it.  I want to discuss that so badly with you.  Who's John Spano?  I heard about it.  He bought the Islanders, even though he had no money.  Literally had no money.  I think they said he was worth maybe a couple hundred thousand, or maybe he had a couple hundred thousand dollars in the bank. 
[00:02:30]  And he had to come up with a hundred and sixty-five million dollars in cash to buy the team.  This was back in the mid-90s.  Right.  He was our big, you know, great white hope.  Oh, yeah.  For us Islanders fans.  And the Islanders were sucking bad.  And this guy comes rolling in from Texas.  32-year-old guy that looks like he was 50 at the time.  Horseshoe bald. 
[00:03:00]  Basically giving everyone a lot of hope that he's going to turn around the Islanders, keep them on Long Island, get a new arena, get rid of that stupid Islanders logo.  The old one.  Well, not the old one.  The in-between one, I guess I should say.  Yeah.  Because then they went back to the old one.  And then everything slowly but surely started falling apart on this guy.  He needed to come up with a hundred and sixty-five million.  He was able to get a loan from a bank in Boston, Fleet Bank, for eighty, was it eighty or eighty-five million dollars? 
[00:03:30]  Eighty-five mil?  Eighty-five million by forging all sorts of documents.  How did he do that?  Well, it was the mid-90s.  That just seems amazing.  Because they interview him in this thing, this 30 on 30 or 30 for 30.  What is it called?  30 on 30?  30 for 30.  30 for 30.  Sam saw it as well.  And yeah, he forged documents.  And he even admits, because they interview him as he is today.  He's like, yeah, I don't think anyone could get away with forging documents like that.  Right. 
[00:04:00]  But back then, he was able to do it.  And Fleet Bank went for it and said, here, here's your eighty million dollars.  So then all he had to do was come up with another eighty million dollars.  Yeah.  And then he had all sorts of excuses and people started closing in on him, going, what the  fuck's going on here?  And he was able to make a deal going, look, I owe you eighty, I think it was eighty-five.  I owe you eighty-five.  So I'll give you seventeen million a year for the next five years.  So he had to come up with the first seventeen million dollar payment.  Once again, the guy only had a couple hundred thousand to his name. 
[00:04:30]  Which, you know, if you think about it, that's broke.  Yes.  When do you think you need seventeen million?  And then, and then, uh, the guy's like, look, I need my seventeen million.  He goes, I'm going to wire it, no problem.  So he wires him seventeen hundred dollars.  Yeah.  And the guy has to call him up and go, there's some kind of mistake.  It's supposed to be seventeen million.  This is missing a few zeros.  I just got seventeen hundred.  He goes, that's impossible.  The bank must have fucked up.  The panic that it set in, too, because when he transferred the seventeen hundred, and he owed them another eighty-five million, they had already signed the team to him. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  They sold him the team, even though he didn't have the money, because he said, I'll pay you tomorrow if you sell me the team today.  He was a great talker, and he was able to go, oh, no, I'm good for it.  And he would show all these documents of all his money and his finances.  You know, it was tied up here in the Cayman Islands, it was tied up in England, it was this and that.  But he had numbers that he was showing people. 
[00:05:30]  He was pulling a Jerry Lundegaard.  Yes.  That's exactly what he was doing.  Yes.  Oh, we'll get those numbers to you.  Okay.  Yes.  Yeah, we'll send them right over.  Oh, Mr. Lundegaard, if you don't send those over, we're going to have to recall those loans.  Ah-ha.  Okay.  That's exactly what he was doing.  Best panicked acting ever.  Oh, God.  Amazing.  Great.  You knew something awful was happening.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah, right.  Good.  We're pretty busy, but that's the way we like it here.  And then he went, is this the Clark Gillies clip? 
[00:06:00]  It's just the trailer.  Oh, you want to see the trailer of this at least, Dan?  Uh-huh.  All right.  They were a team like no other.  Hometown heroes.  Buffy Knot.  Roll mocks.  Buffy Knot.  Billy Smith.  Champions.  Bossy.  They were the most successful expansion franchise of all time.  We always said the success we had was our respect for the New York Islanders and what we learned from them. 
[00:06:30]  Fuck.  And when the triumphs ended, it was a long fall to the bottom.  And that was ugly.  I wouldn't have bought a ticket to watch our team play.  We sucked.  Mike Bilberry.  Until a savior emerged.  All of a sudden, here comes this white knight, John Spano, to save the Islanders.  There's been a commitment made here in Long Island by a fellow by the name of John Spano.  You know, he wants to turn the franchise around.  I mean, it was our dream.  Turn this thing around. 
[00:07:00]  Here is the next coming.  You know, this is the next messiah of Long Island.  He's coming in and he's going to take this franchise to the promised land.  He would walk into a room and there'd be thousands of Islander fans screaming his name.  Wow.  The guy was great.  But the guy wasn't who he said he was.  And in the end, the dream came crashing down.  He's being arrested.  John Spano's failed attempt by the New York Islanders spiraled into federal court today  where the 33-year-old businessman was arraigned on fraud charges on Long Island. 
[00:07:30]  He committed mail fraud.  He committed wire fraud.  And he committed bank fraud.  He jumped in with both feet and almost pulled off the American dream.  He fooled lots and lots of people.  Gary Bettman.  He toyed with us on so many levels.  It was all his attempt to be a big shot.  They call it big shot.  It was everything I hoped it would be and actually it was more.  I mean, for four months, I owned the New York Islanders.  It's an amazing story. 
[00:08:00]  And you don't even have to be a hockey fan.  You don't have to be an Islander fan.  What years was that?  Like 96-ish.  Do you remember him?  Oh, we all did.  We were all excited because after the Islanders won those Stanley Cups,  there was a lot of lean years, horrible years.  And also, this guy came in, like they said, like a white knight to save the franchise.  And he was a bust.  He was a fraud, basically, in the end.  A fraud.  He only had a couple hundred thousand dollars to his name.  And he bought a fucking hockey team. 
[00:08:30]  That's pretty amazing.  Really?  Because no one was doing their research or their background checks or nothing.  He looked terrible for 33, too.  Oh, my God.  He looked like he was 50.  Awful.  Yeah.  So, you know, he was able to get the 80-85 from Fleet Bank in Boston.  Oy.  And then, you know, the owner who was selling the team was like,  all right, now you owe me another 85 million?  Because, all right, I'll give you 17.  17 over, you know, a year for the next five years.  And then he wires him $1,700 in a panic because he doesn't have it. 
[00:09:00]  $1,700.  That's going to, like, buy him some time.  $1,700.  Because who would buy that?  Yeah, that's it.  On that level where guys are, like, multi-millionaires slash almost billionaires,  if something like that happens, you're not going to think that the guy actually meant to wire you $1,700.  Right.  You've got to assume right off the bat that's just some ridiculous banking error.  But then he went and blamed an IRA bombing that he saw on the news.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  On the delay of payment.  Another delay of payment. 
[00:09:30]  Mike Milbury was so good on it.  He was great.  Well, Mike Milbury's a jerk.  He called him an asshole.  A jerk.  And he's calling Spano an asshole and a jerk.  Yeah.  Mike Milbury's ornery.  They kept showing the clips of Mike Milbury going into the stands and beating up the Rangers fan with his own shoe.  Yeah, that's a very famous hockey clip.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Milbury, when he was playing for the Bronx.  I remember that one.  Yep.  He hates, to this day, I think, the Rangers.  Kevin Connolly said he just threw that clip in over and over because he knew that wherever you throw it in, it's going to be a laugh. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah, of course.  Kevin Connolly did a great job.  He directed the 30 for 30.  Oh, is that why he was here?  He was here promoting that?  Was he promoting that?  Did we try to get him on?  Well, I think you guys passed on him.  I interviewed him.  I don't think, did we pass on, I don't know if I would have passed on that one, being an Islander fan.  He might have been because he was in the afternoon.  No, I don't think we passed on that one, to be honest with you.  I think it was a timing issue.  We would have had him on in a second.  He's a hardcore Islander fan, born and raised on Long Island.  And then in the end, it all came crumbling down, and he gets arrested, and he does four years in prison, and then he moves back to Ohio and starts a small business, and then he got caught there. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, I guess he was Mr. Fraud over there, too.  And then had to do another four years, but they were very vague about that.  I'm not sure if he did another four years in prison or it was probation or what.  But the only thing he messed up on with this whole thing was not telling us what he's doing today.  Like, what is John Spano doing today? 
[00:11:00]  You interviewed him throughout the entire documentary.  What is he doing today?  Oh, they didn't do a little update?  No.  They should have had, you know, the graphic, you know?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With the music, and you freeze-frame the guy and go, this is what he's doing now.  You have to.  I even like that with fictional characters.  I certainly want that with the real guy.  You have to.  Yeah, but besides that, it was well done.  Gives you the whole history of the Islanders, where they came from, and how bad it got,  and this guy trying to buy the team. 
[00:11:30]  That's how desperate they were, though.  They're like, yeah, all right, yeah, if this guy wants the fucking team, give it to him.  Uh-huh.  His spin on it was so stupid.  At the end of the movie, he said, you know, my dad said a lot of people, they have these dreams,  and they don't even try.  Son, you tried.  It was criminal.  He lied.  He didn't try at all.  I want to be an ice skater.  I can fool people.  It's my dream.  And instead of saying, you know, I shouldn't have done this, he goes, if I had one more  week, I would have pulled this off. 
[00:12:00]  He's thinking one more week, he would have figured out how to get that $17 million.  How would he get $17 million?  But then he would have had to get another $17 million the next year.  How do you worry about that when it comes?  Exactly.  Exactly.  And then he's partying at the Garden City Hotel.  That's a big famous spot out there in Long Island.  You know, a lot of the rich and famous go when they're hanging out on Long Island, and  a lot of the islanders in the organization used to, I'm not sure if they still hang out  there.  I have no idea.  But he would go there and party and get whores and stuff.  Whores.  He was sitting in the lounge just partying with Mike Milbury, and he goes, hey, I got 
[00:12:30]  some girls.  They're going to do each other, and then they're going to do us.  Wow.  And he, like, he billed the team hundreds of thousands of dollars because he was flying  around and partying.  I was living the life.  And he had no money.  Right?  He had no money.  But at the end of the day, they said he was actually a good owner, because when they did  finally sell the team after they got it back from him, they sold the team for more than 
[00:13:00]  they were going to sell it to him.  Wow.  They made an extra $30 million.  They increased the value.  Yeah.  He made an extra $30 million, the other guy, the old owner that was trying to sell it to  Spano.  All because he got that Gorton's Fisherman off the jersey.  Right.  That's stupid Gorton's Fisherman.  What was the old logo?  I don't remember.  They decided the Islanders went so bad, we got to change the logo.  And we all hated it as fans.  It was terrible.  It looked like the, yeah, that's...  Look at that dumb...  Oh, yuck.  Now, wait, that was the original one?  No, no, no, no, no, no. 
[00:13:30]  It was the 96 logo.  It's a Fisherman with a hockey stick.  Yeah.  It doesn't make any sense.  Well, if you live on Long Island, you fish, you know.  Yeah, right?  There's a fishing community here and there.  But what's the old one?  What's the other one?  What's the one that the fans like?  The one that they have now.  Yeah, the original one?  They went back to it.  Yeah, oh yeah, they just went back to that, you know.  Okay.  The old Long Island, New York, the Y is a hockey stick.  Yeah, you know.  And the Islanders crossed the bottom.  Oh, I like the Fisherman.  I think he's fun.  You like the Fisherman? 
[00:14:00]  Oh, I think it's fun.  But it's like a horrible, like...  It's terrible.  ...drawing and just...  Yeah, it's very complicated looking.  It really is.  You don't even really know what it is at first.  It's a big blue blob at first.  Exactly.  You gotta look.  Is it a mountain?  Oh, he's having fun.  What is it?  That's terrible.  Who designed that?  I was thinking when I was watching this, the panic this guy must have felt.  Oh.  Oh, imagine me.  It's the famous thing we always talk about where, you know, the feds are closing in and  they're gonna be knocking on his door any night. 
[00:14:30]  He talks about the stress and the pressure.  And he had a grandfather clock down the hall.  He lived in Texas, but he came up here a lot.  The TikTok.  And he would just hear the TikTok and it ringing 1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.  And he's just sitting there in bed going, how the fuck am I gonna pull this off?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, he said he would just stay up all night, like, realizing that this was the only time  he had, because as soon as the sun came up, it was gonna be a whole new set of problems.  Yep.  Oh, God.  That's like, it's like our old bit if he did fall asleep, you know? 
[00:15:00]  Of course.  You hear that nice fucking, you're just there, you're laying in bed, maybe.  Oh, okay.  You know?  Oh, I finally got some sleep.  Oh, my God.  That was nice.  Oh, I haven't slept well in a long time.  Oh, what time is it? 
[00:15:30]  Oh, 7 a.m.  Oh, God.  What am I gonna do today?  I think I have something to do.  Oh, my God, I gotta come up with 17 million dollars.  Oh, my God.  I'm a complete fraud.  Oh, my God.  I think we can get him on the show, too, by the way.  Yeah.  John Spano?  Yeah, I think, he's talking.  He's talking.  He's checking. 
[00:16:00]  He is talking.  He wanted to be a big shot.  That's why this thing's called Big Shot.  Didn't you?  And he was a Texas guy.  He kind of hung out with Staubach a little bit.  Did he?  A little bit.  Or used his company.  There was some kind of connection to Staubach.  I'm sure it was some kind of fucking ruse.  Jerry Jones would invite him to watch the Cowboys games in the box.  So he was an up-and-coming businessman.  He had a small business in Dallas.  He did okay, but he wasn't worth even a million dollars. 
[00:16:30]  He wanted to skip all that building the business up to the point.  Just skip over that and go right to the top.  And I didn't know this until I watched this.  He went for two other teams before the Islanders.  Really?  He went for the Dallas North Stars, and then he went for the Florida Panthers.  Wow.  But they asked to see a bank statement and they all fell apart.  Yeah, right?  Well, the Dallas North Stars is a really funny one because they're getting together to make this deal.  Like, they're just starting to talk.  And they go to lunch.  And Spano's the guy that's going to buy the Dallas North Stars at the time. 
[00:17:00]  Right.  So they're all having lunch.  It's disgusting.  It's early on.  And the bill comes.  And they all are assuming, I guess, in the business world, especially when you're making deals,  you know, everyone just knew it was Spano's check to pick up.  Yeah.  It was just a thing.  You just know.  So they're all just sitting there going, what the fuck?  The guy's not going to pick up the check.  Pick up the fucking check.  For lunch.  And he didn't pick up the check.  And that was one of the first red flags. 
[00:17:30]  Allow me to pay the check.  They're like, why, Ralph?  They're like, why isn't he picking up the check?  Wow.  There was some breaking protocol.  Exactly.  As far as, you know, deal making, I guess.  Yeah.  They just knew that, like, what?  He's the one that's supposed to be paying for this, and he's not.  At that point.  And then the Florida Panthers, they were starting to talk, but then I guess they got a new arena  or something, so the owner didn't want to sell.  So then, you know, here come the Islanders.  Damn.  I loved it, man. 
[00:18:00]  I really liked it a lot, and I don't think you have to be a hockey slash sports fan to enjoy it.  Where do you see it?  ESPN.  ESPN.  Oh, okay.  It's like an hour?  Yeah, the 30 for 30.  Hour and a half.  The 30 for 30 is great.  The Sugar Ray Leonard, No Moss one was great, too.  Oh, my God.  That was awesome.  No Moss.  With Roberto Duran.  Yeah, I didn't see that.  And what I learned about that one, I didn't realize they fought for the third time.  Did you know that?  No, I knew it was two.  Sugar Ray Leonard and Roberto Duran had two amazing fights, and then after No Moss, you 
[00:18:30]  fast forward, I think it was eight years, it might have been nine years.  Nine years later, they fought, and they were both over the hill.  Duran was 38 at the time, and they considered him over the hill, and Sugar Ray Leonard was  only 33, and they considered him over the hill already at 33 years old.  For that third fight?  For the third fight, which I believe Leonard won, but it was like, no one really remembers  that fight.  It was almost like a throwaway. 
[00:19:00]  But watch No Moss as well.  That's great.  I heard he's really heavy now, Duran.  It didn't seem heavy in the 30 for 30.  Was he shot recently?  Yeah.  Oh, maybe he lost weight.  Yeah.  I mean, he's a lot heavier than when he was boxing, but I didn't look at him like he was  a fat guy or anything like that.  So he's claiming that he had cramps.  Why?  And he had to drop a lot of weight.  He refuses to tell anyone the truth, because everyone's like, oh, that's bullshit.  He had cramps. 
[00:19:30]  Well, after he beat Sugar Ray Leonard, he went on a partying spree and gained a lot of weight.  And the second fight was only, I didn't know this either, was only, because you forget,  because nowadays they wait.  They fought like four or five months later.  I didn't know that.  That's the first fight.  So he had to drop a lot of weight quickly.  And he's claiming because of that, he was, you know, dehydrated pretty good.  And he started cramping up.  A little crampy.  Yeah.  I told my gym teacher I had cramps once.  And? 
[00:20:00]  And he called me like a faggot and said, only girls get cramps.  Because I didn't know about periods and girls getting their cramps when they have periods.  And I thought like, because I had like a stomach ache and my intestines were like, and I was  kind of out, I said, oh, I can't, I can't do, you know, gym today.  I have cramps.  And he's like, what are you, a faggot?  Only girl get cramps.  Good old days.  I love the fact that every older male.  Yes.  Called me a faggot.  You're a homosexual.  That's adorable. 
[00:20:30]  So that's what I did last night.  I watched this fucking thing.  I watched a different documentary.  Yeah.  It was like, you know, the, um, the more, uh, tender side of, uh, Anthony.  I watched that, uh, that was called Sam or Life According to Sam, the little kid with  progeria.  It was on HBO.  Oh, it was terrible.  It felt so bad.  I know, you know, I'm still going to be like, well, I'm just a normal kid.  But, uh, it's like this woman, she's a doctor. 
[00:21:00]  She's married to a doctor and they have this kid and he's got progeria.  There's only like 250 progeria kids in the whole world.  Do they know before you're born?  No.  I don't think they do.  You sure?  No.  They figured it out.  Uh, like they just isolated the gene for it now.  So they don't even know.  There's only 250.  Yeah.  They don't even know like in utero that it's, uh, going to fuck you up or anything.  And that it's going to, you know, the kid's going to be fucked up. 
[00:21:30]  Dude, I would, this looks like a tearjerker.  It was pretty sad.  Life According to Sam on HBO.  It's, look at all the awards it's won.  I know.  It's really good.  He's, uh, he's like 13 though.  So most of them, that's the top end of their fucking lifespan.  13.  They had one that was 18.  This girl from like India.  Oh man, was she a disaster?  Really?  Yeah.  And then this.  They don't make it to 20, right?  Nah, I don't think they do.  They don't make it past usually fucking 12, 13.  So this kid's like fucking 13 at the time. 
[00:22:00]  And he's really like smart and just a nice kid.  And he just looks so wacky.  They show him in school and he's fucking rattling off algebra to this other kid.  Like helping other kids in the class and stuff.  And, uh, yeah, the mother and father are doctors.  Right.  And they had this kid and like after a couple of months, they're kind of looking at the kid going like,  something's not right.  So they take the kid to the doctor and shit.  And of course the doctors don't know.  They're not going to, they're not going to like think it's something that only 250 kids in the whole world have. 
[00:22:30]  And then finally some, one doctor was like, I think you're, you know, kid has progeria.  And they looked at, um, pictures of other progeria kids at that same age.  And they're like, oh yeah, that's exactly.  Wow.  What's the physical sign?  The physical thing?  The first thing that they notice.  Uh, it's like the skin looks very thin and translucent and you're jaundiced and the eyes look a little fucking buggy and shit.  And then it just keeps gaining a lot of weight. 
[00:23:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the kid wasn't gaining weight.  Right.  That's another thing.  That's why the eyes look buggy.  But then like they get arthritic, big arthritic joints, their, their cartilage and stuff gets also, their nose gets really big and their ears get all fucked up and their fingernails get all fucked up.  And then the bad part physically is that their, uh, their, uh, cardiovascular system, they start getting like hardening of the arteries and shit at fucking like eight.  Jesus.  Um, yeah.  That's, that's horrible.  So the mother like dedicated a life, uh, to, to doing a study because they, they isolated the gene and then realized the gene had certain similarities to this drug. 
[00:23:30]  So they're like, all right, we're going to try this drug study.  So they started doing that over the course of, uh, about, uh, two and a half years, which is like, you know, these kids are like little mayflies walking around.  Um, yeah, he must hate recess at school.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's gotta be like a year to end.  Oh my God.  Like seriously.  I know.  Let's just keep going.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So they, they, they got a bunch of kids from, uh, all over the world with progeria and brought them in like, uh, um, how many were it? 
[00:24:00]  Like 30 or something, 30 of these kids, maybe more and, uh, started giving them this drug.  Now, the thing is the, uh, the way the FDA works, which is ridiculous.  Any FDA approval should be given to progeria drugs because, you know, fucking kids don't have the time to have the time to fuck around.  Yeah.  Um, what do they have to lose?  Exactly.  So, uh, so it's usually done with a placebo group, you know, and, uh, a drug, uh, a group that's actually taking the drugs, but she didn't want to be, you know, again, these kids don't have much time. 
[00:24:30]  She didn't want to not give some kids the drug and give other kids.  So she gave all the kids the drug.  So in the FDA, there's this protocol that you have to go through and they were like, well, no, you didn't have a test group with the, uh, with the placebo.  So we're not going to approve any of this medication.  And the medication apparently did slow down this aging process in these kids, but they wouldn't approve the fucking drug because they didn't have the test group. 
[00:25:00]  Probably some fucking bureaucratic.  Exactly.  It was so fucking ridiculous.  So where are they now?  Well, uh, with the whole drug thing.  She, she, she got, oh, is that going to be in the, it's in the movie.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know what happens to the kid.  I'm saying.  I mean, I'm sure you understand, but I don't want to know it.  Uh, no, actually, I'll be, I'll spoil it for you.  The kid doesn't die by the end of the movie.  He's actually 15 by the time the, the movie, or 16.  Is he taking the drug?  Uh, no, but they have this, they're, they're kind of making headway and getting approval 
[00:25:30]  of some type of fucking treatment.  There's no cure.  There's just a treatment, but they had all these other kids and stuff with progeria and  it's like, oh, you know, one kid winds up dying during the thing.  Like what could the drug do that's worse if you're going to die so quickly?  I mean, exactly.  That's just it.  There, there, there should be like these exceptions.  Yeah.  Put them on, um, put them on an Island or something.  If you're scared.  Right.  If you're scared, they're going to turn into monsters or zombies and at least give them 
[00:26:00]  a chance to continue living.  The, uh, the, the best part of it though, is this fucking kid.  It's like, oh, he's got all this shit going on and there he is in school fucking he's in  band and he's fucking like all kinds of activities and winning all kinds of awards for his studies  and everything.  And you just look and go, this kid's got such bullshit in his life.  What teacher gives it, what asshole teacher gives him a B?  Right.  Just give him a A's across the board. 
[00:26:30]  What are you doing?  Come on, help out.  Leave him alone.  And all the kids in school were like fucking nice to him and hugging him and high-fiving  him and shit.  That's cool.  I have a story about him going to Disney to, and he gets on a ride and it wasn't even  like a rollercoaster ride and he broke two ribs.  Right.  Just fucking, yeah, yeah.  Cause he's, he's got fucking, you know, osteo fucking porosis or whatever.  It's just terrible.  Anthony's becoming a person.  Ah, no.  Between the kitten and the progeria.  I was just thinking that.  Well, I mean, I think, I think our, I think our audience gets really confused by us. 
[00:27:00]  I know.  We're very confused.  Yeah.  You're going to do the progeria voice and get some jokes in, but we do have souls.  Like this brings up a point.  A lot of people have sent me the clip of the, the two down syndrome kids being, um, they  voted on prom king.  Oh yeah.  Uh huh.  But they sent it to me like, Oh, I can't wait for you guys to beat the shit out of these  two.  I know.  And I'm like, you just don't really, and I don't blame some people, I guess, cause I  understand what we do on a daily basis, but that's, that's the type of thing we wouldn't 
[00:27:30]  go after.  It's not.  And they're like, Oh, more PC shit.  I'm like, no, that's not, that's not it.  What makes that story so fucking cool is that the whole high school got together and said,  you know what?  Let's do a good thing here.  And when they drop pig's blood on them at the end, it's really, but it wasn't like, it  wasn't like they rigged the voting and like, look, or, or the school decided, no, the, the, 
[00:28:00]  the, the, the students themselves came together and said, let's do this nice thing.  Right.  I'm saying this to you cause I can't wait for tomorrow.  No.  That's, that's the, um, that's how I, I found out about this documentary.  Somebody tweeted the link and goes, Anthony, you gotta see this.  I can't wait to hear you fucking goof on.  This little fucker deserves everything you're going to give him tomorrow.  Hit him with both barrels. 
[00:28:30]  Right.  Make it hurt.  What the fuck would I, what could I possibly say?  And fair enough, it's, it's subtle, but there is like, I don't know.  There's a balance.  There's a humanity that sometimes people don't think that we have.  Right.  Like I'll make fun of retarded people in, in a, an abstract thing.  Of course.  But as far as like, if somebody tweets me a photo of a retarded kid with Tony Romo,  that famous picture, I can't retweet that and goof on it.  It's too sad.  It's like, there's a difference between taking a real kid who's retarded and fucking sending 
[00:29:00]  his picture out.  It's like, Jesus.  And I'll tell you this, you know, uh, I turned the corner on, you know, the kid that, that's  doesn't have much time and they give him the ball in the football games.  You did.  I think Jimmy was the only one in studio that was for it from the beginning, I believe.  And I was like, Oh God, you know, this gotta be something else you could do.  I'm, I'm all right now.  What, what does it fucking hurt?  Yeah.  I think it's pretty silly.  Yeah.  I thought it was kind of, yeah, but I mean, you know, I'm all right with that shit too. 
[00:29:30]  Whatever.  You give the boy a little happiness as opposed to what?  The jocks who are going to have lifetimes of happiness.  Right.  Let the kid run.  Fuck him.  Yeah.  I saw the, um, I saw in this, uh, documentaries, he's on like a drumline thing at one of the  football games and they had to make a special harness for him.  So it doesn't just bust his fucking little bones and he's playing the fucking drums and  the father's like in the bleachers and he's all proud.  It's just like fucking, uh, and then the whole time you're just going, Oh yeah, he's an 
[00:30:00]  absentee landlord.  There's no God.  Where is your God?  We're people that are against like all this research that will fix this shit.  So you don't have to deal with it anymore.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, not that there's that many, but Oh, I say it's not that they're against.  They got all their rules and that's what's ridiculous.  I say you hack up fucking fetuses in a Cuisinart to get fucking cures for shit.  Absolutely.  Fuck it.  Who cares?  Until they're five.  Exactly. 
[00:30:30]  They should have, they should have, you got nothing to lose drugs.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  Where it's so obvious.  If this person is going to die, you got this new drug.  It's the scenario.  You got nothing to lose.  So I know it's not approved, but fuck it.  And you have to literally sign away the kid's life.  Right.  Like if something happens, Hey, you can't fucking sue us.  Right.  That's it.  Period.  No getting a lawyer.  Even I would love, I would love to know the spin on that where they can't do that.  Cause I'm sure there's so many parents out there that know of drugs and things that they're 
[00:31:00]  still working on.  Yeah.  And, but they know their kids running out of time or a relative.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like, all right, that's the nothing to lose.  And they would chance it because they would chance it in a second.  Of course you don't even have to go to the phones and ask people.  Yeah.  Let's say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Oh, I fucked up.  I meant to go to John.  Charlie, you better be good.  More PC shit.  More, sorry.  More PC shit.  Those dummies.  They really are.  I get so confused.  Cause I'm like, God, we do try to show different sides of ourselves. 
[00:31:30]  It's fucking ridiculous.  I know we're animals.  I'm not going to try to sit here and act like we're like, you know, great guys, but, but  there is, ah, whatever.  If you take any stance that they think is, is inconsistent, not like, Hey, I don't agree  with your stance.  Like you're a sellout.  You've changed.  Oh yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's just, dude, fucking relax.  Oh, let's say hi to Charlie in Philly.  Good morning, boys.  How you doing?  All right.  Uh, you're talking about the progeria. 
[00:32:00]  I watched a show last night on the learning channel.  It was about these people.  They don't age.  It was like opposite progeria.  We did this one.  There's a, there's a woman.  It's creepy as all hell.  Like her siblings are growing up around her and she's pretty much stayed the same age.  But the problem is she's, um, she hasn't developed, uh, uh, mentally though.  Right.  We did this.  Do you remember that clip?  Where they show her like, uh, family pictures for like 15 years and everyone's growing up 
[00:32:30]  around her and she's the exact same.  Wow.  That's fucked up.  Yup.  Yeah.  There it is.  Doctors baffled.  What's the headline again for the people out there?  Doctors baffled.  Intrigued by girl who doesn't age.  Yes.  Charlie.  We played the clip on the air a while ago.  I'm sorry.  I forgot.  Oh, no worries.  No worries.  Yeah.  That's fucked up.  She's like, how old she looks like a baby.  Yeah.  She, they still have to treat her kind of like a toddler.  I think she's in, I think she's upper teens or early twenties at this point. 
[00:33:00]  I think if I remember correctly, I'm trying to give that medicine to everyone.  Yay.  Thanks, Charlie.  It's like Willy Wonka's kissy factory.  Yeah.  She's 16.  16.  Okay.  I meant to go to John, not Charlie, but that was good, Charlie.  John in Maine.  What's up?  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  Hey.  Hey.  Hey, uh, yeah.  Two things on that documentary I watched the other night.  One was on, and saying with the drug and the FDA, she has to get published by a medical 
[00:33:30]  journal.  And so every time she submits it, they won't approve it unless she's published.  So they denied her like three times.  And then on the third time, if you revise it right way or that way, we'll accept it.  So they finally accepted it.  And so now the drug is an approval phase and they're headed to the next step.  But the thing about this disease is what she's discovered when she isolated this gene.  And I'm not speaking from a medical point of view or anything, but the protein that 
[00:34:00]  ages us just basically builds up quicker in these kids.  And that's, that it can't flow properly, I guess.  And so that's what ages them so quickly.  But they're thinking if she can isolate this and discover how to slow it down in these kids,  think they're saying basically she could create almost the fountain of youth because  if she could slow down aging and then you give it to a normal person, then what could  that do for a normal human being?  Yeah, actually, it could benefit everybody. 
[00:34:30]  So let this lady go if she wants to take it on.  That's what we need.  People living fucking hundreds of years.  A hundred more years of that.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you look 300.  I would like to squeeze out another hundred, though.  Yeah.  Just another hundred.  That'd be nice.  It relates to the heart disease, like all the antlers saying, the cardiovascular and  whatnot, that these kids are getting that. 
[00:35:00]  So it's the people that, you know, eat shit all their lives and don't exercise.  They get it, you know, brought on.  But the people that are born with sort of that genetic heart disease or high cholesterol,  things like that, that this could save those people and get away from invasive surgeries  and, you know, prolonging drugs, et cetera, et cetera.  They didn't really get into, to make you understand, because, I mean, that would be a totally different  documentary, the genetics of it.  But they showed, like, this one little fucking speck in the DNA that is different. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  One little fucking speck.  That's it, huh?  That has to be...  You realize the perfection that needs to take place during conception to have a normal  kid come out.  It's astounding that so many come out fucking normal.  This one little fucking gene.  And then they show, like, these things, they look like fucking little logs.  And they're linking together.  And that's how, you know, the matrix of a human is initially formed. 
[00:36:00]  And then they show what happens when this one little thing is wrong.  Instead of linking end to end, one kind of falls on top of the other and just fucks the  whole line up after that.  And that's what happens.  And it's like, that's all it takes?  You know, they can't just remove that log, that loggy thing?  You don't even know what's happening at the time.  The shit in DNA is still ridiculously tiny.  It's crazy.  You just need better microscopes.  Blow that shit up.  It'll be a nice... 
[00:36:30]  Dr. Hopi's take.  I'm telling you.  We need bigger microscopes to see the shenanigans.  It's too tiny.  So let's just blow everything up.  And it's going to be very obvious what's going on.  Oh, fuck.  And then, like, operation, you're like, okay, I got to get rid of this loggy thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Bigger microscopes.  Just blow everything up.  Make it nice and big.  John, thank you, sir.  Thank you, John.  These will all be a thing of the past soon.  Like, once they map, like Kurzweil said, once it's mapped. 
[00:37:00]  Yes.  No more Down syndrome, no more cancer, all this shit.  At least they fixed that Down syndrome thing.  Not fixed it, but they can detect it.  Right.  They could detect that.  Which is an odd thing.  I guess people that have Down syndrome children now, or not have them now, but are having  them, are giving birth.  It's an odd circumstance.  I guess they're so dead set against abortion, because you could find out very early on now 
[00:37:30]  with tests.  But some people are just like, no, I'm not going to abort under any circumstances.  So does that mean, like, people that have Down syndrome children now are very religious?  Is that kind of like what happens?  What do you mean?  Because you're not aborting, if you realize that there's a problem, is it your religion  that keeps you from doing it?  Or, you know, it seems to me that the makeup of the parents of Down syndrome children today 
[00:38:00]  is a lot different than it used to be.  Because it used to just be a crapshoot, you know, you didn't know until you gave birth.  There's probably some guilt involved, too, probably.  You think?  I don't know.  I don't know how easy that would be to do.  You're a daddy.  If you knew something was amiss, would you get the old hoover out?  This is a bad question, but I would absolutely go for the abort.  Right.  Thinking, okay, there's more kids in my ball bag, and those kids won't have a chance. 
[00:38:30]  Now they get their chance.  But I don't know.  I think my wife would fight me on it, though.  Wow.  Yeah, I think so.  I'd have to do the little Doc Martin.  You'd have to put your foot down and go, look, who pays the bills around here?  Where do you put your foot?  Right on the abdomen.  I'd have a tough time with that.  But I wouldn't be, like, skipping around.  It would be a tough decision.  But I think that's the direction I would.  Wow.  Yeah. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah, that's got to be.  That's heavy shit.  It's not a decision to be taken lightly, I'm sure.  But with the technology the way it is and the fact that they can detect certain things.  But I would also abort if I knew the kid was going to be a ginger.  So, you know.  Ah, that's true.  All right.  You know, you've got to do the world of service.  Well, that's a decision couples have to make.  And I bet you there is, like, a little conflict there where one's, like, all in, like, no fucking way.  I don't want to deal with this.  And maybe the other person's like, no, we can deal with this.  Well, the quandary is, how far do you go? 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Genetically, you see that your kid's going to have Down syndrome.  You decide to abort.  They're picking the eye color at this point.  Now, if you could find out the intelligence or, yeah, eye color.  I mean, where do you draw the line between, all right, abortion's legal.  I know that the kid's going to be this, that, or the other thing.  Do I abort because of eye color?  Do I abort because of, you know, disease?  And where does it become unethical?  Right.  Well, they'll start just building whatever you want.  Like, that's how it's going to be soon. 
[00:40:00]  I mean, you just won't have to even make that decision.  Right.  Instead of just trial and error and aborting what you don't like, you could just build what you like.  I don't know.  So it comes out.  But then, you know, am I talking about a society of super children?  You are.  I think I am.  Absolutely.  Linger a tad longer.  I've been asked to donate my genetics.  Oh, really?  Yes, I have been.  What, to a fucking fish hatchery?  Jimmy paused way too long on that one. 
[00:40:30]  Because I had nothing.  I had a thought and nowhere to go with it.  I'm glad you brought it home.  Oof.  Fish hatch.  Oh, very funny.  Hey, can we squeeze in the Mike Francesa clips before our first break?  Oh, please.  We're guest heavy today.  We can certainly go back to the progeria discussion.  Indeed, he do.  And the DNA and giant microscopes a little later.  We love Francesa. 
[00:41:00]  I walked into the dentist's office yesterday.  I was in the waiting room.  And there was Mike right up on the screen.  They were watching him in the waiting room.  I was very...  It was very popular.  I was kind of chuckling to myself, waiting for something to happen.  But I looked and I saw his Diet Coke there on the console.  It's like, ooh, the famous Diet Coke.  He spills it.  It gets knocked over.  And then he still has it there, uncapped.  Right.  Right up on the console.  He doesn't learn.  Maybe it's a repeat.  No.  No.  It was a new one.  He was talking about the World Series. 
[00:41:30]  Okay.  Cardinals.  Okay.  Boston and the Cardinals.  Okay.  Well, the Red Sox had a fine game last night.  I guess they romped, huh?  Yeah, he won.  As they said, a one-sided, lopsided score.  What do the Sox say?  Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win.  What do the cards say?  Beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer, beer.  Green, green, green, green, green, green, green monster.  Fucking great.  That's so stupid.  So Mike Francesa, we're breaking him down. 
[00:42:00]  All this guy has to do, because it's now really becoming way more of a thing.  It's been happening for a while, yes, we've got to acknowledge that.  But it's really ramping up.  All this guy has to do is show a little humility and go, ah, man, you got me.  but he he's all knowing he he he he tries to make it sound like he knew he's being pranked when it's  obvious he didn't know no just fucking admitting go all right you got me cool whatever me but now  people are obsessed with getting them because they know you know they know it gets to him 
[00:42:30]  he's such an arrogant asshole yeah oops i like this too because it's old school like the it's  regular radio it's a call-in show people are calling to prank right that's something that  was done years ago and it's still going on on uh mike's show yes is in her mid-teens it's so  mind-boggling yeah oh that was uh that's that's the kid that won't grow up yes uh let's see so so uh  this isn't our mongo by the way is it no all right mongo tells mike francesa that he's 
[00:43:00]  a bad example because he drinks diet coke yeah mongo calls mike all the time and drives him nuts  i've listened to so many different names no it's always mongo why why does he take the call  because he always starts with like serious questions oh yeah and then he goes into something  stupid okay jimmy in queens what's up jimmy hey mike i got two bones to pick with you  um first you know the new england journal of medicine says that one soda a day you'll guarantee 
[00:43:30]  don't worry about my don't worry about my life go ahead just worry about your own give me give me  the next one that's all what is it that you called up the it said you had two yeah two what's the  second one i think you're showing a bad example okay so i'm not another drink so you don't want me  drink okay i'm sorry if you don't want me i didn't ask anybody else to drink the soda if i want to  drink it's my business okay don what's up don i don't i don't promote it i'm not advertising it i 
[00:44:00]  don't tell anybody else to drink it i'm not telling you to drink you know what call up coca-cola and  pepsi and talk to them about it they're the ones putting out billions of bottles of the stuff a  year don't worry about me setting a bad example okay donna let's fill this up don okay okay i love  that crutch he's got that okay now the obvious obvious thing there monger doesn't give a fuck if  mike fresco drinks diet coke every day but he knows slight fuck this he knows this is a little  a little way to get to him a little bit uh-huh you don't care mike that you're drinking diet coke 
[00:44:30]  and you should know that and then uh i like this one a lot this one came in two days ago  frank in the story because you know why they're just used to winning that's why  frank what's up frank what's up i got i got a question for you i'm trying to understand it as  a layman just interpreting the rules yeah one player can't mount the other one from behind  one player can't push him so he's he's mounting him from behind and then just not mounting him he's  pushing him in the back can't push him forward so he's so he's not thing i mean he's got 
[00:45:00]  mounting means he's leaving the ground he does it has nothing to do with leaving the ground he's  not allowed to push it i knew that the whole time why did you give it up the first time it wasn't  funny it's not dumb yeah and go back oh he dumps up that's a dump that's why there's a jump so the  guy must have been like mount him from behind and fucking kept saying mounting and then someone told  mike uh you know that's a prank that's a prank and this is why i love this call too mike mike had no 
[00:45:30]  idea he was being pranked uh-huh guy tells him he's being pranked but now he can't accept that he's  ever no being got no so he's now he's covering his ass by saying he knew the whole time which he  didn't and that's what makes these great he did why would he keep it going if he knew right so go  back to the jump but i knew that the whole time one mounting means he's leaving the ground he does  it has nothing to do with leaving the ground he's not allowed to push it i knew that the whole time  why don't you give it up the first time it wasn't funny it's not clever it's nothing okay it's not it's 
[00:46:00]  not very funny you know if you're gonna come on with something please be funny or original i mean  that's not even funny uh 140 here's the mink man a it was funny hilarious b it was original  fucking you had no fucking idea right mike's being an uh an uptight asshole is the joke every time  every time the beauty is he doesn't get it no no and that's that's what drives these people like oh  it's so easy to get to okay okay he's like a fucking teenage girl okay okay sounds like mr mac 
[00:46:30]  okay okay i drink my diet cook i would love to call him his chips so badly oh should yeah like but  this world series whatevs right whatevs yeah whatevs okay what's your question okay we have a chipper  chipper where do you live chip it's from conch from the conch yeah i thought a touche 
[00:47:00]  i thought a touche uh i gotta say lady dies twitter's become my favorite thing it is uh fantastic i got  people in my house all in too oh yeah they're just reading the twitter it's fantastic they're amazed by  this she will just tweet like your name yeah or or my name or yeah she was trying to have a  conversation with my cat who apparently has a twitter account i don't know you know yeah but uh 
[00:47:30]  yeah she's she's we're blowing up her twitter too oh my god she's got like 2200 already 2200 two  days in that's not bad most people would would love that oh yeah and she still doesn't know how it  works she wants to know if lou albano is the actual lou albano who obviously is dead  for a long time yeah she doesn't know what fake accounts are yeah lou albano i know him from twitter  and uh yeah she's asking him if he's captain lou he's the actual captain lou albano she looks like 
[00:48:00]  captain lou i got a new one i went with babe ruth yesterday babe ah i know everyone's doing the  throw mama from the train yeah yeah yeah thing but i went babe ruth and then did she go oh i'm not  babe ruth yes i went babe ruth takes everything seriously i have a william churchill asshole that  i am william churchill correct my tweet how dumb am i william churchill i love it jesus christ i love it  you look like jerry delano roosevelt i'm a goddamn fool 
[00:48:30]  now we got a break because we got guests coming in now oh shit uh we got neil degrasi tyson coming in  next uh-huh and we also have tammy pescatelli very funny uh female comic makes the best tammy  pescatelli my mother used to make the pescatelli melting your mouth huge fan of the show too she uh  i became aware of her because of last comic standing many years ago yeah she was on with 
[00:49:00]  voss right oh i don't remember i think she might have been on with voss i gotta ask her it's been so  long i don't remember either now and then john mackenroe wow for the first time in a while yeah and then  there's a whole there's a whole fucking uh there's a problem in rochester now there's that  fucking thing on the news it's just we should cover that oh what's that my show is this weekend yay  tomorrow i'm not feeling uh i feel the cold uh oh let's get some coldies going i uh took some  yesterday and i'm not getting that swallowy thing today it helps the gulps yeah getting the gulps it 
[00:49:30]  doesn't uh oh and podcast number 24 is out there i hope everyone's subscribing to our podcast and i  hope you're at least spreading the word to the people that can't listen to us anymore yeah because  man this this service is becoming a bit expensive i'm hearing from the people i hate that i know i'm  hearing from the people they chime in they're like well i gotta go they're like come on hang in it's  always i don't want to go but i gotta go right so expensive hopefully those people know that we got a 
[00:50:00]  podcast at least it's you know it's anywhere from an hour and every once in a while we go long form  like this week is long because we're doing the whole e-rock cell phone saga you know you cut one meal  from your kids every day and you know you could afford it right exactly what's more important your  your fun and laughter from this program or you know your kid getting fat your wife needs your bunions  fucking fix exactly one hair appointment for your dumb fucking wife or you know nails your wife's  vaginal gout right let's go let it roll yes yes let's do this uh all right i'm taking up so 
[00:50:30]  it's the opian anthony podcast so go find it it's on itunes and elsewhere but this week is the  e-rock cell phone saga  got neil degrossi tyson coming in to the studio 
[00:51:00]  uh-huh promoting uh star talk live monday november 4th at 8 p.m tickets can be purchased online at  ticketmaster.com and that's uh here in new york city uh at uh town hall right sir very cool what's  up neil good seat first time on our show yes absolutely we're on the air yeah good morning to  you yeah we just pop right on right on the air welcome to the show thank you i gotta ask you 
[00:51:30]  right off the bat about gravity man you got a lot of a lot of headlines no people got all bent out of  shape i i i just put out a dozen tweets i thought let me just i saw the movie i enjoyed the movie yeah  and they got like a lot of stuff right but i thought it'd just be fun to just point out a couple of  things that they didn't get right yeah and it ended up on the today show the next morning  and on brian williams the evening news it must have been a slow news day that's usually what 
[00:52:00]  happens it even landed on on uh on saturday night live weekend update right so so that's good i  think it's a good i mean you gotta be happy about that well no i don't care me i don't care i'm  thinking that a few tweets could trigger this much curiosity in the media community uh about  a movie about space right i think that the takeaway here is that it's that that it's a good sign  that people are thinking about science and care enough about it to argue without rehashing because 
[00:52:30]  we haven't really done it on our show what were the what were some of the things wrong with gravity  so you're gonna get me in trouble again i'm gonna list these really that's what you're trying to do  here you don't have to do the whole thing again was the fact it was a woman in space  no no i mean sander bollock's hair should have been floating in the air obviously no i think that's  the only one i figured out on my own well so right so i think they purposely gave her short hair  because it was really long then it'd be obvious that it wasn't floating right that was just to make  it a little simpler for them plus she either had too much mousse or it was like a or it was a wig or 
[00:53:00]  something but yeah the hair should have been a little more floaty another thing she's a medical  doctor that's what she is and they made an important issue of that but she's fixing the  hubble telescope right i'd like me some medical doctors but i'd keep them away from my telescope  that's my telescope excuse me you have this amazing technology and you're filming this amazing movie  and then you make those little weird little weird because the one we brought up was how they had that 
[00:53:30]  small talk about so where you're from it's like they don't know anything about each other  they would know everything about no camaraderie right also george clooney's asking him so where's  your hometown they would know which where everyone's you know body moles are and secret tattoos they  would know this of course at that point i loved it but there was that one i really liked the movie by  the way yeah i gotta say that where they had the thing where uh she's like how long did you train  for and she's like oh six months so it was like she took a crash course in um in hubble fixing yeah 
[00:54:00]  but the movement was great was there was the movement seemed realistic to you the way they were moving  in yeah so the general i mean what what the what the movie pioneered it's it's you know it's 99  percent zero g movie yeah so i said the movie has the wrong name it should be called zero g zero gravity  not gravity sell tickets if it was sold back and then i got kind of geeky on people and i said uh  the movie should also be renamed angular momentum oh way there we go just to pull a little bit of  physics out of now we're talking high school yeah can you explain angular i mean i i understand it 
[00:54:30]  but they don't yeah sure as long as we don't get a pop quiz at the end of this no it has a lot to do  with newton's third law yeah so everything to do with newton so you if you're in if you're in motion  fig and there's no friction with the ground or air or anything you'll just keep moving all right  now and it that's called just regular momentum we we know about that with cars and car accidents and  things but if you're rotating that's called angular momentum because you can think of it  as rotational momentum once you're rotating you will not stop rotating until you put in a force 
[00:55:00]  that's the opposite of that rotation so that's what happened which they did brilliantly with the fire  extinguisher right yeah she turns on the fire extinguisher she starts rotating as well as getting  pushed to the side and every action has an equal and opposite reaction there you go and so all you  really need is if you want to if you're in space and you have to maneuver you have to send something  away from you you can toss something away you could burp or any other kind of flatulence you will recoil 
[00:55:30]  in the opposite direction of those flatulence and so but the problem is if you're in a space suit it  doesn't count because you're stuck in your space suit you're not getting that force you're not getting  the full fully expelled gases i watched one of the astronauts up in the um space station take uh  i don't mean to get flatulence on you this early in the morning i'm just thinking how effective i'd be  up there you'd be spitting your ass off one of the uh astronauts up in the space station took uh was  single hair and um was was obviously floating uh in in the space station a single hair between two fingers 
[00:56:00]  and pushed against a pipe that was there and was able to push her entire body away from the wall  just using a single hair that's why right when sandra bullock is holding on i don't know if you saw  the move he's holding on holding on to george clooney and he's he's dangling there at the edge all she'd  have to do is give a little tug right and then he would drift towards her right right but no all right 
[00:56:30]  he you'd think he was it was cliffhanging or something and then she lets go and then he flies  away no no now if he was holding on to something that was spinning at great velocity exactly and let  go then he would if i remember the scene correctly the earth is sort of stationary out there relative  to them so they're not rapidly rotating but that would be the case right if you were rotating then  this is what we call the centrifugal force would uh throw you off fly off at a tangent otherwise and 
[00:57:00]  even so he didn't go off at a tangent so right they're thinking he's dangling off a cliff so so  i i listed these and then people said it's just a movie or it's fiction or this and then i thought  about i said no what i said i loved it i said i said wait excuse me all right costume designers for  example get awards for for being precise in their period yeah you don't have a 19th century jane austin  novel and somebody walks in with tie-dyed shirt and bell bottoms and somehow that's okay that'd be great 
[00:57:30]  or i thought about this like like my sister is a is a big fan of these 19th century you know like  jane austin films right and they her community of of of fans if if you if if the carriage is not  right man from that period or or if the servant says the wrong thing to the other person in the  mansion they know there's enough that not they didn't do that yet in 1888 you know so i'm thinking 
[00:58:00]  people need to get a life i know that's that's a little too picky 19th century nerds right i know  exactly right 19th century geeks if so if if they're allowed to exert that level of criticism  on their film i don't see anything different about being a scientist and doing the same  oh i love that you did all the way and then all of a sudden you're you're like you know  criticizing the film there's one thing i've been obsessed about as far as the movie goes what's that  why the frog the frog at the end oh why the frog there's like four people in the movie and a frog 
[00:58:30]  what does the frog represent yeah that was a plus if she lands randomly out of orbit yeah she's not  landing in a little pond where she could just swim to shore she's gonna land in the middle of the  freaking pacific ocean a shark will eat her or she's gonna be on an ice flow with a polar bear so what a  stroke a lot most most of earth is not like will not accommodate a random drop out of orbit  but yeah plus her legs she's she's a 49 year old woman and those her she had barbie legs and i think 
[00:59:00]  they retouched her legs you think in post i think she supposedly stays in pretty good shape no you can  be in good shape but there wasn't a single blemish there was a lot of leg shots in this movie you  know that yeah you saw it butt shots and leg shots you know that's how she looks i dated her for a  while she doesn't like that yeah i didn't know that was jim jay  nice can i ask you a question about the god particle um they have found it yeah i mean what 
[00:59:30]  the way the way this works is you have evidence that builds you have a slight signal in the noise  and then you say that could be it we need more data and if you have more data the signal improves  relative to the noise and say that's the signal i'm looking for and when i say signal i mean it's it  could be a pulse it could be a a blip and the blip gets stronger relative to the noise and you reach  some threshold you say okay that's what we we're pretty sure is the the god particle the higgs boson  right now what exactly it does that does that mean if they find it or if they have it and what exactly 
[01:00:00]  well it's it's it might have been more interesting if we didn't find it in in the frontier of physics  when you're looking for things that you're pretty sure have to be there and they're not  then you go back to the drawing board you say well we there's some deep stuff we didn't get  right coming into this but we found we i mean my physics brethren found this and i'm an astrophysicist  i don't look for little things i look for big things um so so they so they found it and this is  a particle i don't you remember from your from the news cycle that it's a particle whose field grants 
[01:00:30]  mass to other particles so if you want to be a particle that you know that's a good one to be  and that's why i had said how it got the name the god no one's calling the electron the god particle  right so that the power it has over nature is extraordinary in this regard is that what they're  trying to do they're fine like the dark matter and all that stuff and we don't know how it all  fits together there's a lot of profound states of ignorance we now dark matter dark energy uh there's 
[01:01:00]  the frontier of particle physics maybe at the end of the day one answers the other and that's happened  in in the past in the history of physics completely distinct challenges uh areas of ignorance that  confront us one gets solved with hey that's the answer to these other questions wow and so that's how  you know you really you really understand nature when when you have this cross-pollination of these  research frontiers yeah that's there's just so much that seems not even that's that we don't know 
[01:01:30]  about that seems out of reach to even learn about that you know that's a brilliant way to i mean of  course it is there's the stuff that's hijacking my thought no no so here's go so it's it's uh here's  something i don't understand and here's the question i'm going to answer and so then you set up an  experiment to answer that question but what about the question you have yet to think to ask right  yeah what is the answer to that so this is so many of those there's right right and and and in a vast 
[01:02:00]  expanding universe uh it's you have to be humble we can't even comprehend as humans uh the the expanse  of the universe it's just it's no we can no we do that all the time yeah yeah yeah the the the whole  never-ending space thing alone is enough to know the problem there is our brain our our primate brain  is not wired to embrace infinity i don't know if you remember the first time you ever i remember when 
[01:02:30]  i was a kid and you learned that shit it creeps you out it creeps you out i remember i remember what uh  kennedy when i'm maybe older than you guys when kennedy died and they set up his his uh uh john f kennedy  and had his grave and they said here's the eternal flame it's like what what does that mean like  earth will be gone and this will still be burning no that was my first encounter with with the concept  of infinity and then i said but look it's a little vessel and it takes energy there's an infinite 
[01:03:00]  energy in there i started getting all existential on it um but that was my first encounter with  infinity in math and in calculus you what you end up doing i think is just growing accustomed to it  you learn how to calculate and once you do that then you it's not as scary but you still you still  want to just you know you want to just chill every now and then yeah i've had enough of the speed of  light by the way i'm tired of light because like when they they said that like even if you're if you're 
[01:03:30]  like like almost 99.9 percent of the speed of light it would still always look like it was like you  could never kind of see light traveling at the same speed and that's just frustrating and that's  just relativity with which we discovered before we my previous physics brethren when uh after  relativity we discovered quantum physics which is the physics of the small of atoms and molecules  and nuclei and that's creepier crazier than even what relativity is you had an accurate description  there you go near the speed of life turn on your flashlight it leaves goes away from you at the speed of 
[01:04:00]  light nothing on earth has that that corresponds to that life experience so we're discovering the  universe is behaving in ways that fall outside of anything your senses ever told you was true  and so therefore you cannot invoke the normal criterion that doesn't make sense for deciding  what is right or wrong in the universe yeah yeah did you get i'm sorry did you get weirded out  when you thought that the speed of light when they did that test and then they opened up the 
[01:04:30]  experiments to people because they thought they had that uh was it a neutrino that went faster than  the speed of light oh you remember in the and the big particle accelerator in europe a particle  accelerator that we might have had here in america until congress canceled the budget for the  superconducting super collider back in the early 1990s getting back so so there was the possibility  that there's a particle a neutrino it's one of the fundamental what we think of one of the fundamental  particles of nature that what it was measured to have arrived at a destination fat before it was 
[01:05:00]  sent from the particle accelerator which would mean it would be going backwards through time moving  moving faster than the speed of light right okay well no sorry i didn't say that right it got there  faster than a beam of light would have gotten there and all of our theories tell us that if you manage  to go faster than light then you will be living backwards in time we had a name for those particles  called tachyons uh you know the tachometer it's a it's the in your car yeah rpm yeah your rpms the  tachometer measures speed and tachios is is greek for fast speed and so that's where you get that 
[01:05:30]  word so tachyon would be the hypothetical particle that exists faster than light so it would have been  very interesting if we had faster than light particles ftls if you want to yeah i want to get in  the club yeah i talk about ftls all the time when you knock on the on the speakeasy door you know what  ftl is you're good so uh do you think because it seems to me like the speed of light is so amazing  and we know all this stuff but how could since the industrial revolution and i was an einstein 
[01:06:00]  that figured it out on a chalkboard how could he have gotten like that basic thing right like how  can a thousand years from now we not find things that just prove that we really have no idea yeah  that's a good point well are we just idiots today compared to what we'll know tomorrow not really it  turns out and i'll tell you why in the era of modern science and i and modern meaning having  an experiment a hypothesis you test it you have a theory that's we've been doing that for about 400  years now when you do that and you have an idea that's tested and testable and verified that idea 
[01:06:30]  doesn't later turn out to be wrong once you've verified it by multiple experiments and we get your bias out  of it right you get your friend to do it they get someone in another country who hates you to do it  and if you all get the same answer you have found a new understanding of you've landed on a new  understanding of nature so the way science generally progresses in the era of since galileo on with 1600  is if you have a better idea or a new idea it gives you a deeper understanding of nature that encloses 
[01:07:00]  what you understood before and you learn that what you understood before is just a subset of a deeper  understanding of reality and so it's not that you learn that it's wrong it's that we learn that it's  incomplete that's how that's how science has unfolded since then that's why it's not it's  not that we're all just hanging around one truth uh-oh we got to go to another truth now now you think  that's true because because the press hangs out in the coffee lounges of research institutions and  they look at the very latest paper that isn't quite verified yet and they say oh now cholesterol's good 
[01:07:30]  for you oh no cholesterol's bad for you and then you think scientists don't know what the thing is  going on in the world because they're tracking the bleeding edge where consensus has yet to emerge  in the laboratory and so you think science doesn't know but you back up a few steps we're on it they  just report on the destination and not the journey between the the two theories to understand that on the 
[01:08:00]  bleeding frontier that you you're gonna we don't we don't know anything on the bleeding frontier yeah  but once we know it it's in the book wow yeah what is that new telescope uh dr kaku talked about it  did they did they meet yo kaku my man on here yeah yeah oh yeah good guy man he can be what you want  you want some mind-blowing stuff just spend ten minutes with him we have and he lives in my building  and every time i sleep this is a running joke on the show we've interviewed him many times and every  time i see him he just has no memory of me whatsoever he's so busy thinking of thinking of real  thing can't fit you into his cosmology not only does he not say hi he runs away scared and you 
[01:08:30]  just feel like an idiot when he talks because he puts everything in terms of like it is like uh  the sun is like a huge gummy bear like you say he puts things simply you could you can tech it up a  little for us you don't have to dumb it down to the point of fucking you know i think rinse cracker son  and i think neil will say hi to us if he sees us on the street right right that's good well he's a  theoretical physicist yes he is theoretical those guys those are probably the weird guys in the  scientific community because they just kind of come up with that nobody has any idea yeah even 
[01:09:00]  you guys make fun of them exactly like you obviously have a personality uh kaku not so much  so well he's trying to keep he's trying to keep it real but what is that can you turn off your brain  when you're like a kaku type or you're constantly thinking just no if you're if you're the greatest of  the scientists were obsessed with what they're doing as in any great artist think about it right  i mean you're you're if you're in the company of someone who who's made some great discovery or some  new uh they are in the moment in the groove and you're kind of irrelevant to them so you you you 
[01:09:30]  intersect if i may get relativity on you you intersect each other's world lines this is your path through  time and space and then they just keep going on right so the world line is a great concept so you  could be in the same place but at different times and you don't meet you could exist at the same time  but at different places right you don't meet those are your world lines only if you're in the same place  and the same time do you meet that's why you don't get smashed by trucks every time you cross the road 
[01:10:00]  you make sure your world line never intersects that of a truck okay relative to the truck  exactly exactly my world line intersected an attractive woman  kind of a nice collision relativity is such a uh kind of bizarre concept to people it's it's very  hard to understand like i said it defies your your common sense but but it it's understandable if you  put it in terms of like if you if you're stopped in your car next to a bus and the bus starts moving 
[01:10:30]  forward and you're looking at the bus you'll feel relative to the bus that you're going backwards  you'll jam on the brakes your brain got fooled and especially if they're large objects you know  because relative to the bus you are going backwards exactly exactly now we've known pure  just movement like that since galileo right the einsteinian relativity it includes all the weird  stuff when you get near the speed of light yes relative to now the speed of light that gets wacky but  but basic relativity you know you're in the back of a box truck and that's doing uh 50 miles an hour 
[01:11:00]  yeah and you throw a ball uh-oh he's doing one of those word problems  people get the shakes now from new york to chicago train leave chicago going 54 miles an hour  the ball relative to the truck is doing 50 miles an hour but in the real world it's actually doing 100  miles an hour if you throw it at 50 miles an hour in a truck doing 50. now can i tell you something  really obscure i mean just sure are you ready for okay love this if you uh in a in a two-car head-on 
[01:11:30]  collision if they're both going like let's say 50 miles an hour that's a bad collision people would  not normally survive that and you think that it's it's an accident that's the same thing as like a  hundred mile an hour going into a wall right i think yeah because the wall's not moving and you  know it's not oh it's not it's a 50 mile an hour collision you know how is that why because  because if if if you're going 100 miles an hour into a wall you have 100 miles an hour's worth of  kinetic energy okay whereas if you smash into another car you only have 50 miles an hour's 
[01:12:00]  worth of kinetic energy the other car has 50 miles an hour's worth of kinetic energy you both get  destroyed so the energy that would have doubly quadruply destroyed you going into a brick wall  some of that energy is destroying the other it's distributed into a car you're sharing the  destructive energy yes that's right because you think like the the the yeah so the relative speed  is 100 miles an hour but you only are damaged by the 50 miles an hour of your speed it's the old you 
[01:12:30]  can't get something for nothing never no free lunches in the universe so you're you're you're destroying  two things with the energy of 100 miles an hour but it's distributed between two things  and that's good brain work this early in the morning that's great i wonder if anybody about  to have an accident has ever comforted themselves i've had enough physics i'm thinking newton's laws  every moment i'm in a car and the people you know i i did this once it's you see it less today  because there's laws requiring you wear seat belts but i i would in the summer time just before 
[01:13:00]  it's summer before you have the air conditioner on but late enough so that you don't have the heater  on so people have windows open i go up to the red light people not wearing seat belts  and i say excuse me have you ever taken a class in physics before nine out of ten of them say no  because if you've had physics newton's laws of motion boy you'd have on your seat belt because  you would fully understand how the laws of even in the back seat yeah i love that one  no you're safe in the back seat no one puts their seat belt when you get in a cab but front seat 
[01:13:30]  you and that's what you need it most yeah it's very dangerous we're in a limousine oh  oh you know where you don't need a seat belt if you're driving in like a a truck because the  seat belt is for when your vehicle stops abruptly because it hits something else that made it stop  uh-huh when if a truck hits a car the car the truck keeps going much more mass the larger your 
[01:14:00]  vehicle the less you really need a seat belt that's why they don't require you wear seat belts on buses or on  ocean liners right on ocean right okay yeah because it's going to travel uh further it's going to  take longer to stop it's because that mass has a man the man he knows the shit he knows the man is  good didn't even graduate high school my man is good he didn't even graduate high school i'm self-learned  hey uh i gotta ask you about uh god and religion obviously what's your general take on all that  uh a man no no because we could discuss it for hours i know i'm not you got two minutes 
[01:14:30]  you got two minutes eternal damnation what you got okay what do i got on that all right i'm gonna  assume you're not a big uh religious guy actually uh about a third to to forty percent of of scientists  in the united states will pray to a god on the premise that that god would intercede in their personal  affairs so being a scientist even a productive scientist is not synonymous with being an atheist 
[01:15:00]  for example as so many people had presumed my issue is um i i'm kind of i i resonate with what  galileo said back in 16 in early 1600s he looked at the bible and noticed that his telescope taught him  things about the universe that the bible got wrong got wrong they didn't match up right and he came to  conclude that and i quote the bible tells you how to go to heaven not how the heavens go wow is that  a quote from galileo wow that is a hip quote from galileo pretty good so when you realize this the 
[01:15:30]  issue in modern times especially in america where freedom to express your religion is is endowed by  constitutional law that the issue is not that you can or shouldn't express your religious freedoms  it just doesn't belong in the science classroom and so i i take issue when people want to change  a science curriculum to match their religious philosophies that well we live in an elective 
[01:16:00]  democracy if you wanted to choose to have that happen just understand the consequences consequences  are the next generation will not understand how science works and science is the and innovations  in science and technology are the foundations of a 21st century economy or the devil's lie  if you want a country that can thrive on the the economic landscape of the 21st century  just leave science the way what it's doing don't try to come in and say that you need a miracle to  make something happen then if that's your understanding of how the physical world works 
[01:16:30]  you're not really useful in the laboratory so how far are we peering uh into the universe these days uh  these days yeah this week we this week this week how far we we you know there's the race for what  is the farthest away galaxy that anyone has ever found and the next generation space telescope known as  the james webb space telescope to be launched in a couple of years that will be able to see galaxy if  it's forget the one what's the farthest galaxy that's gonna that's gonna detect galaxies being born 
[01:17:00]  wow and when you're there you you got it all right so basically we've got the pretty much the  whole universe mapped out is this i'm sorry this one kaku talked about their launching that's going  to go between the sun and something oh yeah yeah that's probably the one so this one has a special  orbit that goes a million miles beyond the moon uh way in deep space far away from earth and the  interference of of what we have because it has to it views the universe in infrared light which is  invisible to our eyes and infrared is emitted by anything with that has a temperature so they have 
[01:17:30]  to deep cool this telescope otherwise it would be observing its own its own heat wow and and you have  so deep cool it that it it disappears from its own signal and then you can see infrared objects in the  depths of the universe they figure that isn't that amazing god damn i would launch it and just wreck  everything by this big hot blob floating around all day that would be ruined my head my way  are you are you uh scared of death knowing what you know you know that does it help that's an 
[01:18:00]  interesting question my my memoir i wrote uh i ended my memoir with a a reference a brief recitation  about death and once you know that you dine upon flora and fauna your whole life if you're vegetarian  it would just be the flora do you dine upon it and from that you derive your nourishment not only your  vitamins and minerals but also your calories that your calories keep you alive calories are not a 
[01:18:30]  bad thing they're only a bad thing if you're in a wealthy overfed nation right most of the world does  not get enough calories a calorie is a unit of energy that you measure and that's what keeps your body  temperature at 98.6 degrees it's what gives you energy to move that matters when i die i don't want to be  cremated because that takes the energy so hard earned that assembled into the cells of my body  and just radiates it back into the atmosphere and into space what i want is to be buried so that the 
[01:19:00]  flora and fauna of the earth can dine upon my body the way i have dined upon them my whole life and only  then can i justify my existence on this earth sharing my energy back with the rest of my worms yeah yeah  let the worm enjoy whatever is left of me when i'm buried and that brings me comfort because i don't  want to be eaten by work you're dead you know the words i that keeps your energy in the cycle of life on 
[01:19:30]  earth well even cremation though wouldn't that keep the energy you know it could go into a storm cloud  thank you your energy still exists in the universe it just doesn't nourish other life uh-huh the worm  can't can't work with that all you did was heat the air molecules and that radiates back into space  right right and you want to maybe possibly trigger a butterfly effect storm with your heat  yes there you go six months later it's his hurricane a hurricane right exactly 
[01:20:00]  no so once i once i understood the balance of energy uh in the universe and energy in my body  i would i'm i was comfortable with that but also the prospect of death compels me to work harder  in my life when i'm alive which is the the notion people want to live forever then what's your hurry to  get anything done if you live forever so i think the fact that we have a limited lifespan that we can 
[01:20:30]  have some understanding of when you get to middle age you start to see that i think that compels you  to be a little more productive and and think about it why why don't you give plastic flowers to your loved  ones you don't because you give live flowers because you know they're going to be dead in a few days  forcing you to embrace all their beauty and all their aromas while they're there wow so that's  that's not the reason i would give live but that's an excellent that's much better than the reason i 
[01:21:00]  would have i like that because that's that's where i get the results i want but you're absolutely have  a much sweeter reason yes can i ask you about uh how far back can they see with uh with the hubble and  how much farther back will this telescope that you're talking about so now we're in the in like we're  getting into the single digits here so we can see 90 low 90 of the time back to the big bang and so  with every next telescope now we're incrementing 93 95 98 99 there is a wall however there's a wall 
[01:21:30]  beyond which light does not penetrate uh in other light can get in there but there's no information  coming back out it gets all scrambled and that's the famous cosmic background radiation that's a wall  that was set up in the universe when the universe was about a half a million years old about 500 000  years old the universe has only been transparent to light since that time if we want to see before 
[01:22:00]  then we can't use light you have to invent another kind of telescope whose information penetrates that  curtain you can use a neutrino telescope a gravity a gravity wave telescope or some kind of telescope  yet to be imagined or invented wow so the closest we'll get is about a half a million years  before the big bang after the big bang i'm sorry yeah you were living back in time there yeah yeah  so do you think there's a life out there i if you study the problem relative to what we have if you  study the problem you would be inexcusably egocentric to think otherwise you look at how big the universe 
[01:22:30]  is how many stars there are how many planets we now know there would be if we studied if we look  close enough to every single star you look at what we're made of the ingredients of life itself  they're not rare if we if life on earth were made of some isotope of business you could say hey we're  got we're made of some rare stuff off of that periodic table of elements no get you get the four most 
[01:23:00]  common ingredients in the universe we're made of three of them okay and so we're not even made of  something unusual so you you put it all together and the more we study life on earth the more diverse  the more diverse are the conditions under which we find life to be thriving when we grew up in this  room when we grew up that the biology textbook said you need a warm pond you know the room temperature  you need room temperature if you like room temperature but we have microbes that thrive in high 
[01:23:30]  heat low you know freezing temperatures high radiation high pressure low pressure this is the  diversity of life and these light these these forms of life that like these extreme conditions we call  them extremophiles the file as you like it's a nice it's a extremophiles that tells it that's going on  here on earth and given that it means it widens the the net with which we cast into the universe to  search for life elsewhere will we ever find it in our lifetime next let's say if we're going to find 
[01:24:00]  it in our lifetime it's because unless it comes here and visits us if we're going to find our  lifetime it's because we've been rummaging around the soils of mars or in the liquid oceans beneath  the frozen surface of jupiter's moon europa with the nasa's mantra today is follow the water because  any place on earth you find liquid water you find life even the dead sea it's called the dead sea  because the people who named it the dead sea didn't own microscopes it just doesn't have macroscopic fishes 
[01:24:30]  all right so that's just before you start naming stuff because you think you know what's going on  chill for a moment that's hilarious can i say what you're promoting to because you're an amazing uh  guy to listen to uh neil is promoting star talk live and that's monday november the fourth at eight  o'clock tickets can be purchased and this will sell out a ticket master or just call 800-982-2787  or at the town hall box office it's a town hall new york's midtown new york city yeah that's that's why we  have a radio show and podcast star talk radio where normally if you have a science show there's like 
[01:25:00]  the journalist host and you bring in the scientist yeah i thought well the people who listen to that  already know they like science because you listen you're tuning in for the scientists so we inverted  it and i am the host and my guest in in in most cases is hewn from pop culture oh wow so i have a  pop culture guest that star talk has the double meaning there and then i talked to that person about  how science has influenced their life and livelihood i'll give you i had john stewart as a guest once 
[01:25:30]  and that's when i learned in college he started out majoring in chemistry really so then i so i said  why would you ever know that right because he's not a talk show host he said chemistry so i asked him  the geek question did you have a favorite element and that's the nice geek thing you do with it yes i  did i said what he said carbon and i said that's one that's my top three anyway and i said but why for  you and he says oh because it's the slut of the periodic table it can combine with all other  elements every which way so now so in star talk radio we celebrate science through the lens of 
[01:26:00]  pop culture and and in star talk live every now and then we have a live show and we just do it on  stage and we have comedians come and help out and it's great it's fun it's a podcast it's a podcast  and it's a and on on broadcast radio as well have these guys try to get you i mean seriously no i'm  waiting for the call hello oh my god we have like a million downloads a month and i mean we're we're  there wow it's feeling good too oh my god they should put you on serious like that yeah and then 
[01:26:30]  be in the be in the hood fascinating stuff that's right so there's life out there obviously oh so my  point is yeah getting back to your question but we're not going to find we're going to find just uh you  know oh yeah so most life on earth is microbial all right you realize in one linear centimeter of  your lower intestine lives and works more microbes than the total number of humans who have ever been  born oh man so we think we're in charge as far as they're concerned we're just vessels for them to  do their thing oh that's we're like anaerobic vessels of fecal matter for microbes to do their 
[01:27:00]  thing you know how many times i've been called that so it's the so so most of earth is that so  if you want to use earth as a template then most planets that have life you they'll have microbial  life will they have life that has contemplated itself uh that that maybe not so much maybe that's  rarer and so and also if you throw a dart at earth's timeline how often will that dart land where you 
[01:27:30]  have what we call intelligent life we've only been on the scene last you know couple hundred  thousand years in our current body form right yeah so and most of the times the dart hits the earth you  would not get anything remotely really uh resembling complex life so if that's your measure of things  then out there in the universe you stumble on a planet that could be anywhere in its own evolutionary  track we we should be happy to find any kind of life at all much less the kind that you would go and 
[01:28:00]  shake hands with or whatever appendage they extended your way what did you think of uh contact i thought  that was pretty an amazing way i thought it's one of the best movies ever and certainly the one of the  best movies of the decade in the 1990s it comes to what i liked about it was first it didn't show aliens  it admitted the that we made contact with intelligent aliens but didn't imagine that you could even  imagine what they would look like right because if they're aliens and they're intelligent from another  planet they should look more different from us than we look from any other life form on earth with 
[01:28:30]  whom we have dna in common but you look turn on a hollywood movie it's some creature walking towards you  with a head or okay they give it antenna or three eyes or an almond-shaped head or whatever  these are human these are humanoids excuse me we got stuff on earth that looks less like humans than the aliens do  and they're on earth you should be you should worry if who you know who walks out of the craft is like 
[01:29:00]  a lobster now you're talking all right something and i can tell you something else because let's just  get it off my chest and i tweeted this one uh can i get my twitter handle here yeah i tweeted  neil tyson at twitter yeah yeah twitter yeah at neil tyson so what i tweeted gonna follow you starting  right now it's it's it's it's just cool alien the the flying saucers they you notice they're all  handicapped accessible you have you noticed there's always a ramp you never see aliens stumbling 
[01:29:30]  downstairs so they were handicapped before we had before we had figured that one out yeah there are  lawyers who have sued in other universes for lack of accessibility it's depressing almost  i got i got a question we throw around here on the show you got humans on earth and there's nothing  that comes close to us and intelligence and building stuff why is that oh that creeps me out okay because  the rest of the animals on on earth they sort of are in the same same development stage okay more or 
[01:30:00]  less and then all of a sudden you get this huge jump and you get humans okay are you prepared to receive  what i'm about to tell you man i can blow my mind are you ready first that's a great thought  to have because you see the distance we are intellectually from all of our life forms on  earth our joke let's get the closest life form the chimpanzee right but our joke is like why isn't  there like a squirrel at the bus stop with you in the morning okay i got you i got this you're on i got  are you ready yes are you seated yeah okay all right so so keep in mind here who does the defining 
[01:30:30]  of what intelligence is fair enough we define i get it and we say look how distant we are  in intelligence from other creatures let's get the closest one to us intellectually that would be  the perhaps the chimp likely the chimp and the chimp what it can do it it can stack boxes and reach  for the banana it could do that all right i think some research has shown they can even put up an  umbrella they can do some rudimentary sign language they got some of that they're adorable when you 
[01:31:00]  dress them in little engineer out there amazing oh the hat and recognition of themselves right is that  considered a thing in a mirror yeah yeah you can get some of that so so and that's the closest to us  that we share 98 and a half 99 percent identical dna with a chimpanzee but look what we do we have  philosophy we have poetry we have music we have the hubble telescope right and the chimp ain't got jack  all right so here's my question back to you this was gonna happen that's a quiz maybe the difference 
[01:31:30]  in our intelligence with the chimp is as small as that difference in dna  imagine because the chimp the smartest chimps that we bring forward the primatologists bring forward do  what our toddlers can do our toddlers do what the smartest chimp does maybe the maybe that difference  in intelligence is small and how would you imagine this think of another life form we might stumble 
[01:32:00]  upon that's that one half percent difference in dna beyond us that same half a percent difference that we  are beyond the chimp what thoughts would they have they would roll stephen hawking forward and say  their humanologists would say here's one that's slightly smarter than the rest because he can do  astrophysics calculations in his head like my little timmy over here just came back from middle school 
[01:32:30]  or from preschool if our toddlers do what chimps do their toddlers will do what ours do and if you are  that smart the ability to build a hubble telescope or stick us put a stick in a termite mound to  extract termites would look the same to someone who's that much smarter than we are when you look  at fish are you contemplating how much smarter uh uh catfish is than a minnow you're not having those 
[01:33:00]  thoughts for all we know the catfish is brainy fish compared with in the fish world but you don't care  because you're so far beyond all of them so my big worry is that aliens observing the universe  will see us down here on earth and conclude there is no sign of intelligent life anywhere we're all  just lumped into the same dummies that run around uh like the dung beetle and i exactly so look at the  cute thing they have these little things called cars and planes and another spaceship 
[01:33:30]  that's no different from the chimp you know yeah given what they're accomplishing you don't walk  down the street and contemplate what a worm is thinking right but why aren't they building  shit like us maybe they have and concluded we're not interesting or possibly we are their zoo  what do we do you get penguins you put them in you throw some ice in the water and you paint a  a glacier in the backdrop drop the temperature say and and how do we know that's not what we are 
[01:34:00]  to them good twilight zone that one was exactly oh he knows oh yeah yeah still i think my favorite  show of all time twilight zone it's fantastic yeah right so so i lay awake at night not only contemplating  that but wondering whether we are actually smart enough to figure out how the universe works  why why would we be the measure of anything that is smart you know why because we defined what smart 
[01:34:30]  is and here's the hubris of that here's an example i often give you have a book called called um uh  optical illusions who doesn't love a good optical illusion right i care for them a lot of  which way is that facing wow now it's going the other way the staircase one oh my god so here's  two people looking at each other so here's what those books should be called they should be called  brain failures because that's what it is that's what our show should be called 
[01:35:00]  brain is it is it in the diagram is it longer or shorter oh my gosh i can't figure it out but our  hubris prevents us from confessing our own states of ignorance to ourselves but we are in do we have  the ability to improve our own intelligence right through computers and all that stuff and what they're  talking about is like uh what ray curswell talked about a google that you just all of a sudden uh yeah  i'm not fully convinced he's he wants to say a year will come the day will come where computers the 
[01:35:30]  storage capacity the the computing power will be enough to rival and exceed perhaps the human mind's  ability to do this so you just upload your brain and then you become the computer and then your body  doesn't matter anymore and he and everything we know will be different after that day and i'm just  not i gotta one day have a conversation i might get him on star talk just to have a conversation with  him to find out why he thinks this because we've been bested many times by things we've invented before 
[01:36:00]  when the machine came i'm plowing the back 40 um you know with with sweat equity and someone said  here's a tractor i'm using a tractor and i'm staying at home drinking a beer i don't have a  problem that the tractor can do it better than i can and we got computers that now beat us at chess  that beat the best chess player we got watson okay who who beat the best ever jeopardy contest but the 
[01:36:30]  computer that beat uh the chess player or jeopardy can't plow the field well but nobody's our  creations can't beat you at if you could lump all that into one thing and then make it adaptable and  able to grow let that do the work and i'll be in the bahamas call me when you're done i'm just saying  i don't i and to upload your mind fine but the idea that that would still be you i'm not convinced of  that because uh the things in my mind that are not you we have different life experience that yeah just 
[01:37:00]  one of many things that distinguishes one person from another i upload my mind and then like i said  i go to the bahamas i meet people i have a nice dinner is the computer doing that no yeah yeah it's  not so i continue to grow my life experience and my relationships and and what is the it's stuck in  the moment of when i uploaded what i gave it right how could it continue to be more creative than i can  be creative based on new information i've yet to learn that happens through my world line isn't that in 
[01:37:30]  a way the moment the computer is separated from you it has a different world line yes isn't that  looking at like an almost like there's an intangible thing like when you're saying that like isn't that  almost giving credence to the fact that well there's an intangible a soul or something that can't be  quite accounted for like so it would be it would be if it the way the science fiction vernacular takes  it is has the computer achieved consciousness self-awareness so that it makes decisions on its own  without you even having programmed it in that way right now computers do exactly what we tell it 
[01:38:00]  they do not what we want it to do what we tell it to do which are two different things here so they  do exactly what we tell it to do because we programmed them so that was the interesting  thing i don't know if you saw watson in action so that one of the other contestants gives an answer  and it turns out to be the wrong answer watson is still calculating what the answer is and he says  okay watson and watson gives the same answer as the other person can wow watson hadn't figured out 
[01:38:30]  that if someone already gives an answer and it's wrong right you don't give that answer  any dummy would know that standing next to me right but it kind of opens up the thing it is there a  limit to the human mind um when you said can can we reach a point where we can't comprehend since i can  imagine us life form that has that same dna difference advanced beyond us that we are from  chimps i am humbled by the brilliance that such a life form could bring to bear on solving problems on 
[01:39:00]  i mean just look at how we we like to say we're smart but look at the dumb stuff we do as a species  all around the world hey you're living on oil that i want i'm going to kill you  right meanwhile the whole universe is is is overflowing with energy well i'd be embarrassed  if aliens came here to visit and they say hey how you guys doing with your energy well we're still  pulling fossil fuels out of the ground i want stuff to be more proud of before i start showing off our 
[01:39:30]  civilization to intelligent aliens that happen to visit yeah don't be so don't be so eager to have  them land here right now it's ridiculous we continue to destroy each other and yeah yeah and  everything on earth when you when you start really looking at how tiny earth is compared to  the rest of the universe and let's make everything warmer while we're at it yeah yeah and flood the  coastlines yeah speaking of earth what how do you feel about the people that think it's only 6 000 years  old uh it's they they if they think that they think that because that is mandated by their religious 
[01:40:00]  philosophy exactly okay you know i mean i just keep it out of the science classroom that that's all i i don't  try to confuse that with doing science science we have learned science has completely transformed  our culture it's doubled our life expectancy it has brought comfort and uh health and well-being  and and not only science but the fruits of science the technological fruits of science  and of course you need to be good shepherds of this power because in the wrong hands it could be 
[01:40:30]  used for evil all right this is the great sort of dichotomy of great the great of unlocking the  secrets of nature so uh so i don't i'm not going to fight them to tell them the universe is not  just stay out of your way no no not my just the science classroom right no and and and if you want  to put it in the science classroom understand the ramifications right your country will go bankrupt  because you will no longer be in a position to forge the economies of tomorrow that will require 
[01:41:00]  uh science and technological innovation at least the next question because a few people on the lines  are asking do you believe in god i i i'm not convinced if if here's here's the thing if every every time  i talk about god with someone who's a believer god is is is all powerful and all knowing and and and all  good right the the good is a big part of this and then i look at all the ways earth  wants to kill us you know a tsunami takes out a quarter million people hurricanes earthquakes 
[01:41:30]  tornadoes floods and and i add all that up either the god is not all powerful or is not all good  but it can't really be both given all the ways the universe wants to kill us and and and if earth is not  uh finish killing you there's the asteroid that could come in an asteroid rendered 70 of all life 
[01:42:00]  forms extinct back in the famous one in 65 million years ago that took out the dinosaurs so there's so  many ways to die not at the hands of someone else who has free will that i i don't know what what is the  nature of the god that you're talking about i i i gotta like try to like use your logic back at  you but don't we define what what is good and what is bad so we see a tsunami wipe out a whole bunch of  people and we're as human beings going wow that's bad because we define what bad is maybe in god's 
[01:42:30]  brain eyes whatever the hell that's that's not bad well but except you defined what god is oh boy  wow that's that's so why why do you have the power to define who and what god is right but not have  the power to define what good is my point is we just don't know it all not even oh oh sure so so  therefore uh if you're going to say god actually is good and a quarter million people dying from an 
[01:43:00]  earthquake and a tsunami and and other natural disasters um and god presumably has control over  that and god is good then we have to then say god works in mysterious ways right there you go that's  that but people only say that when their understanding of god fails them when it's something bad no no  no when they can't understand it they thought god works in mysterious ways but somehow in these other  ways you did understand him right how are you saying well this is the this is the handiwork of god 
[01:43:30]  this you're doing god's work god wants you to do this somehow you know god's motives every other way  when when but when a quarter million people get wiped out god works in mysterious ways why do you  why why do you even claim to have access to god's mind in some contexts and not others just admit you  have no clue right and get on with life that's how i look at it we just don't have a clue when it comes  down to it well i'd like to think that preserving health and longevity that is a nice operational 
[01:44:00]  definition of something that's good right how can you argue why how can you debate something that  keeps you alive and healthy that's got to be a something that's good i can't i'm i refuse to allow  someone to say i'm going to give you cancer birth defects and shorten your life and somehow call that  good i i'm not going i hear you i'm not going there what do you think happens when you die didn't we  have that part of the conversation earlier in the show when you're not paying attention no but i said 
[01:44:30]  i go into earth and that's it right my body's energy is handed over to yeah i heard you a lot  and clear no no we can we can measure that if you want to say something more than that happens you have  to step out of objective realities and then believe what happens on faith and people have faith in a lot  of things i don't have an issue with that i but i know i can measure that i have energy content and a worm  is going to capture that energy and a plant is going to capture the the decomposed carbon dioxide 
[01:45:00]  that comes out of my body that's going to happen and that's not going to satisfy any of us as far as  our lives go no but it means your energy lives on in other life forms on earth i know i i personally  find that quite satisfying and has the benefit of being objectively verifiable nice i have a uh a  question about uh asteroids or comets because uh since shoemaker levy hit uh you guys are not you guys  there's an up on oh man he just this is can i inform your audience shoemaker levy uh that's a 
[01:45:30]  comet discovering team i thought it was a law firm i think we were sued by that once what happened  there's uh david levy and eugene and carolyn shoemaker are comet hunters yeah and in fact  they discovered a a an asteroid a comet and asteroid hunters they discovered an asteroid that i was so  honored that they named in my honor they proposed it it was accepted there's there's asteroid  one three one two three tyson that that team discovered and i'm quite honored by it i checked  i had to double check it's not headed towards earth yeah right now i happily accept the honor 
[01:46:00]  so they discovered a comet that had broken apart and was on a collision course with jupiter and in  fact it slammed into jupiter back in the 1990s and it was amazing we observed it from earth amazing  footage there's this big black spot where it hit and you could they said it would have ruined it  it was the size of the earth a little spot that yeah the entire scar on jupiter was bigger than  the the planet earth oh right why is that and so whatever's true there's no dinosaurs left on on  jupiter i'm fascinated with that and the fact is that red storm on jupiter how come if that red storm 
[01:46:30]  is just a weather system we still see it why isn't it and why is that that that spot still as it was 25  years ago no no the spot's long gone oh is it i thought it was still there no no no no spot spot's  long gone now what's cool about the spot this is an impact scar left in the atmosphere of jupiter  because the there's the energy of the collision completely wreaks havoc in the local area of the  atmosphere but here's what's cool there were two dozen or so chunks of this comet that had broken 
[01:47:00]  apart on a previous bypass to jupiter jupiter's gravity disrupted the physical body of the comet  and it created this long train of 24 pieces here's what's cool when the first piece hit  the next piece does not hit in the same spot because jupiter rotates so you got to see every  successive scar as they hit jupiter's surface as jupiter jupiter rotates twice as fast as earth does by  the way and so you got to see the simple fact that jupiter rotates as these pieces all otherwise 
[01:47:30]  hitting the same spot in space right but a different location surface on jupiter's surface  so those have gone away the jupiter's red spot that we've been we've been seeing that for the  last three or four hundred years it's a sustained weather system that still is a bit of a mystery  and has it not maybe i just by the way we don't know we don't have a full we have some provisional  answers for how you can sustain a weather system that long but it the universe continues to brim with 
[01:48:00]  mysteries and why should it be you know relative to our life right right yeah thank you you know  right right it's think about it we have hurricanes that last uh weeks that for sure all right and  that's on earth which is tiny and we don't rotate as fast so now we have jupiter which is you know  jupiter is ten times wider than we are as a planet rotates twice as fast is mostly gas  all right so a lot jupiter give it some space here to do whatever it wants to with his weather i mean 
[01:48:30]  to a to a mayfly the hurricanes here last uh lifetime you know he's getting filled up he's getting  deep here now we sent the probe to jupiter and i guess it fell down and then got crushed uh  oh yes you could say literally yes it did fall but that was on purpose we didn't it didn't accidentally  oops yeah once you're done with your spacecraft why don't you do the leave one last experiment to find  out what happens as it plunges into uh through the surface that's right how far it will ultimately 
[01:49:00]  get crushed by the pressure how far down would you make it before you got a human being yeah yeah uh  you would uh suffocate in the vacuum of space before you got to that point but ignoring that  complication yeah on a ship okay uh you you go in well it depends on how how structurally stable your  ship is or your skull is but you i mean it's it's not we don't have to think about jupiter to answer  this you just say what kind of pressure you can think about it in the ocean what kind of pressure would  totally crush your body you can't go too far down with like the titanic you know miles down below 
[01:49:30]  the the surface the weight of the water above you would just crush you like a pancake but no like a  crepe yeah the weight of all the pancakes too thick you need something better yeah and uh what is it uh  right because we have atmospheric pressure here on earth's surface it's 15 pounds per square inch here's  something you might not have known if you put you press a suction cup and you try to lift it up you  can't because it has suction well there's no such thing as suction what's happening is you took away 
[01:50:00]  the air beneath it that was balancing the pressure all around it now you're lifting the entire column  of atmospheric weight that's sitting on top of your suction cup yeah and if your suction cup is four  square inches it's four times 15 pounds per square inch you have to lift 60 pounds of force upwards  to pop it off the table it comes off and you say look it's sucking itself down no the atmosphere is  pressing down on you so now you go underwater you have not only the weight of the air on top of the 
[01:50:30]  water you have the weight of the water on top of you yeah water is heavier than air denser than air  a lot of people get that backwards all the time that it's uh suction but it's actually pressure and  yeah and they say you know nature abhors a vacuum no most of the universe is a vacuum nature just  loves vacuums it's your it's your limited world view that tells you that some nature somehow hates the  absence of air yeah yeah so uh i'm fascinated too with with the uh the voyager which is uh i remember  my science teacher in high school stanley butt cabbage told us that what a name for a teacher wow the 
[01:51:00]  abuse but he made such a big deal of the fact when uh voyager one left i want to say our solar system  which i guess was when i was a freshman high school which i guess is 82 and now where about  is it it didn't just reach another milestone it depends on how you define the solar system  generally when you learn the solar system in elementary school it's the enumeration of the  planets back in our day pluto would have been in that list no longer so you could say when  voyager passes the orbit of neptune the the last of the eight planets it has left the solar system but 
[01:51:30]  wait a minute there's a new swath of real estate discovered beyond neptune which is what got pluto  into trouble it's a swath of icy bodies with the same composition and orbits as pluto right and so  that's called the kuiper belt of comets maybe you have to wait till it gets past that well voyager  you know got past that all right and so it's kept going and since then it has passed the sun's  the influence of the sun's magnetic field on all the particles that float around in space and it is 
[01:52:00]  crossed into the magnetic field of the galaxy and that's what made headlines just recently which  would have been much later than when you were in high school of course that they were probably  finding some other boundary of the solar system to reference maybe it was when it passed pluto  or something i don't i don't remember launch no i think when did it go up in like 77 or something  oh when it's launched yeah uh 1977 that's correct voyager one and two yeah and they said it's being  powered by something that's like a little light bulb like worth of power oh yeah it's i forgot was 
[01:52:30]  it 10 watts or something very very low wattage yeah dimmer that lower energy consumption than your  refrigerator light that's amazing so yeah that's what's powering the whole thing and it has 70k  of memory nice oh that was that was talking you were talking back that was that was hell yeah back in  the 70s you you got a date if you had 70k of memory and what no we all know a klingon took um 
[01:53:00]  target practice on it though right to that star trek no anyone a v-ger star trek or v-ger yeah yeah  yeah there's v-ger in star trek uh in the original star trek uh what you know what gets me about  v-ger i assume people have seen the movie you know v-ger it was voyager that you know apparently the  the oya was rusted over yeah in the voyager and v-ger had acquired all knowledge of the universe  achieved consciousness and then came back to look for its creator right and that freaked out the 
[01:53:30]  crew because it was messing with earth and i'm just thinking if it acquired all the knowledge of the  universe why didn't it know its name was voyager you think it would have figured that out yeah okay  and also just to be fair that was voyager six not either the voyager one or two  what age did you realize that you comprehended this stuff because like a math for me is never  it's why i'll never be a great chess player i'll always be average because math for me is very  difficult but you there's a way to comprehend it where you just it resonates with you and i just i've 
[01:54:00]  never been able to no you it's people think you're just born and wake up and then you comprehend it  no you you work at it i mean go to any olympic gold medalist they work at it they didn't just  wake up that morning and get a gold medal so yeah the universe is complex it's large it's awesome  it's terrifying in its infinitude and what matters is that you are drawn to it you are seduced by it  it is the seduction of the unknown that gets me out of the bed each morning to to ask how do i now learn 
[01:54:30]  how that works either learn how it works in ways that other people have already discovered  all right that's what you do while you're in school but then you get to the phd and then you've  learned what everyone else knows you have one foot is what in what is known and one foot in what is  unknown you're at the perimeter of ignorance and as we say as the perimeter you know as the area of 
[01:55:00]  your knowledge grows so too does your perimeter of ignorance so knowing doesn't always mean there's  less to learn sometimes it means there's more to discover i think that's the side of the brain  though that like you you're not born with necessarily the knowledge but i think the gift or the ability  because you're not born with any knowledge other than the instinct to suck  which i've made a career  i was being literal not figurative okay uh yeah we have a couple of instincts that are in us and uh 
[01:55:30]  and and and to the woman the the the sucking baby is pleasurable so if it hurt we would go extinct  really quickly early on in the in the in the species so there are factors in play that make making more  babies pleasurable and other than that we have we learn what's going on in our environment but when  you're a kid and you're knowing this stuff is that like i was 11 when i figured out this is really 
[01:56:00]  cool i want to learn more of it yeah there's an interest too like if you're interested in an  interest and want to know more it's like if you're interested in playing a guitar you're going to pick  it up same thing screw with it every day of same thing and then you learn how other people play and  then one day you're really good at it and then you invent a new a new way of right a new way of doing it  and and uh my first uh my first exposure to the universe was at age nine a first visit to the  hayden planetarium but i gotta ask this question so when you're really young nine years old can you  either choose the guitar or learning about the universe did you see or are you more prone to 
[01:56:30]  how much you want to get laid right or is your brain wired enough to where you're going to be prone  more to go for the guitar first i think the geek is the new football quarterback okay and look at how  how many people go to comic-con just you look at the rise of what is the number one sitcom on  television it is the big bang theory so i think there's a there's this changing in the i think  you know why it's because you need your geeks to fix your computer at the end of the day or to invent  the computer that you want for tomorrow and in principle a football quarterback could do that but 
[01:57:00]  generally the history of them is that they're not that person so so um but my point was when i was um  i was making a i was going to make a really deep point when you're 11 years old no no about the  guitar and the universe did you do you remember there's a gary larson comic it's jimmy hendrix as  a young boy okay and he's walking up to to the music store and the accordion shop is closed 
[01:57:30]  but the guitar shop is still open disaster averted that's funny wait a minute that was a ziggy  that's funny so you think that uh it's something that you learn i i still think it's a side of it  that there's something i think there's something in your brain because i can never look at math like  i mean maybe i didn't work hard enough but my i cannot i think you're born with some kind of ability  but and hopefully you find that there's probably people out there that would have been great math 
[01:58:00]  minds but for whatever reason didn't didn't find that spark they took a wrong turn the world line  missed missed an opportunity uh here's what i'll tell you when you realize that if you go to china  and you want to speak to the chinese you got to learn chinese and any language expert will tell you  it takes several years to get really fluent and ideally you should move there and immerse yourself  and if you don't move there it might take you five years move there two or three years in either 
[01:58:30]  case it takes years to even just get comfortable with it when i look at the universe and you realize  that the language of the universe is mathematics and i want to have a conversation with the universe  i'm learning the math and look at the symbols of math and i don't think it's that different from  learning a completely different alphabet and having to communicate in cyrillic or or tie or  or or or or chinese characters and think about it they're expressing ideas in a complete 
[01:59:00]  other iconography and so not iconography what do you call a um a character set and so that's what  math is it is expressing yourself in a completely different character set and there are rules we have  rules in english the verb goes here the noun goes there you conjugate it this way you that math has rules  yeah but there's not a third of a verb if you if you had to have a fraction of a verb i'm finished  but you but you do have fractions of words yeah okay okay you know there are words that are compound 
[01:59:30]  words and you could be one of the things you learn in elementary school is that some words are composed  of others i think people think of the difference between like writing and and math is it's more abstract  if you look at uh writing and and english and uh language but if you break it down into the actual  letters and the rules of a language it isn't as abstract you're the tools yeah i think a linguist  would probably argue with you but i'd have to agree that the rules of math are unassailable basically yeah 
[02:00:00]  they're they're more definite yes but the rules of of writing there are certain rules you have to adhere  to that isn't that creative kind of abstract part of writing and that part of writing i'm claiming has a  similar kind of uh i don't say rigidity but but a formality right right you find in mathematics with  those tools you could make very creative and very abstract uh uh ideas but but no you can do with  math too so here's the thing so math is a language all right math is not the destination it's a path 
[02:00:30]  so if when i have an idea about the universe and i represent it mathematically if my idea is accurate  i can manipulate the math and make a discovery that the math enabled because it is a logical  representation of the idea what humans are not good at is thinking logically using words whereas if you  represent the words and your ideas with math then you manipulate the math that's a way to manipulate 
[02:01:00]  the idea with the perfect logic that mathematics endows you um the power and uh that mathematics endows  you with and upon doing so you use the math to come up with whole new ideas about the universe  and so that's how a great writer would use the language to come up with a whole new way of telling  a story or a whole new way to develop a character and take for example the movie inception that was a  completely different new way great to talk about a plot line and folding time and the pace of time 
[02:01:30]  is that the right movie inception no no it's an inception where the way they're going back off  the van yeah you don't know if it's real or it's not whether it's a thought or not yeah yeah that's  a whole somebody it takes a creative person to take the leap from a boy meets girl and they fall in love  and end of story even with the the rigid rules of mathematics you could use that to tell an abstract  story about the universe well so in a rarer case you advance mathematics this way right right 
[02:02:00]  more typically you're using order or quote ordinary math to advance physics to advance our understanding  of nature that's and occasionally you do invent a new math isaac newton said you know someone asked  hey ike why why do planets orbit in these ellipses these flattened circles rather than perfect circles  because he had a theory that showed ellipses and he put someone asked him why and he couldn't answer  it he said i'll get back to you so he goes home comes back a few months later here's why 
[02:02:30]  because they're conic sections you cut a cone and you get an ellipsis circle of a parabola hyperbola  they said well how did you come up with this he said well i had to invent integral and differential  calculus and that then enabled me to solve this so he invented a branch of mathematics to solve a  problem in physics so occasionally and so occasionally you get two for one you get a new physics problem  solved and it required new math if you're smart enough like he was wagging the dog on that one more  shit we have to learn in high school yeah that's true thanks isaac thanks a lot you prick 
[02:03:00]  really how about a i don't know every once in a while  neil this was great yeah i got i got i got i got to run yeah this was great i just want to take a  drive with you and pester you with questions that's just what i want to do too drive with you  that's my idea about a deal day right and all day you just go wow i think you think about uh physics a  lot when you're driving in uh the winter on icy roads i'm constantly thinking of yeah we don't 
[02:03:30]  think about friction as an active centrifugal force all this shit when you're driving on the ice is like  okay here comes a curve and you can almost picture what the mass of your vehicle will do  in in a certain situation yeah and the reason why you slide off the curve at a certain speed on a  slippery road is because the the curve is not banked high enough to keep you right now the friction  between the nascar for example you know have you been on a nascar track it's ridiculous the camera 
[02:04:00]  doesn't capture right this doesn't do it yeah tv does not really capture the actual slope of that  so you can do the physics of this and you can say at what speed is the ideal uh what is the ideal  speed for the car to have for this bank of a turn and you find out what that speed is and it depends  on the track and the track conditions and the size of the track but you can bank a curve so that at  200 miles an hour it is completely stable going around the curve now here's what here's the thing 
[02:04:30]  people say a nascar people only know how to turn left well it's not really true if the if the  bank has the perfect angle for your speed it is the bank that turns your car and not you right you  can keep pretty much straight not pretty much you can just never turn the wheel and you can go in  perfect circles for having done so if the bank is at the right angle for the speed that you're driving  so that allows the driver to only have to steer to maneuver among other cars rather than to steer to 
[02:05:00]  stay on the track i mean obviously if you think about a car going fast enough to stay on a 90 degree bank  let's say oh that has to be that's the speed of light that that's the speed of light that's we got  that one that's the speed of light all right you with me on that all right so without without any  like degradation no it would fall it would fall right right yeah you need the speed of light  on that one wow that's hilarious oh that's too fast for me to be driving but listen  we gotta get in the online let's just talk about this all day god damn it it's degrassi 
[02:05:30]  or no the silent e that's not degrassi high you know right yeah no degrass tyson but you just call  me neil that's fine thank you just get rid of that e we don't need that all right an amazing  i wanted a numeral in my name because there's a silent three you know something just to mess  with people like dead mouse but the five at the end yeah yeah yeah yeah um uh neil tyson on twitter  and again november 4th monday night at eight o'clock star talk live so i guess you're doing your live  podcast just a yeah yeah every now and then we do a live version of it right at town hall 
[02:06:00]  eugene merman uh eugene merman does yeah that will be with eugene merman yeah a really funny guy  he's a buddy of mine he's very funny and he'd get that a ticket master and you're you're a fascinating  man uh uh to go see you at town hall i think would be great all right thanks thanks very much  all right guys thank you you know you hadn't ever called before now you know this is stupid  carl never wrote you know what are we thinking well now we are our what happened uh we world  lines have intersected okay damn and they will intersect again all right all right guys thanks neil 
[02:06:30]  the opian anthony show sirius xm  sirius xm  it's the opian anthony show  damn 
[02:07:00]  welcome back to the program no it's not i want to thank everybody for 20 minutes  eric nagel says get the back to work yeah what's this about it eric to rush everybody around  we spoke to this character easy relax and um i will not i will just interact with this character we  just stay an hour and a half with neil degrasse uh tyson and then eric decides after four minutes  we got to get back on the air that's single the hell get back three reads a double plus two minutes  of filler oh shit oh i am me dummy i say grassy i just didn't know well it looks like the grassy 
[02:07:30]  i know but i should have known that i was uh what are you gonna do i was telling anthony you're on  lithgow by the way yeah fuck him it's lithgow we all know that stop already uh just when the  whole country it calls it lithgow once that's what it is rose by any other name that's true  why yeah you just because the whole country mispronounces his name he has to change his name  that's the rule if everyone starts calling you one thing then shouldn't we officially be calling 
[02:08:00]  this the opening and anthony show all right now you're being wise ass true what about that  fucking uh the uh the football guy which guy i forgot his fucking name the one oh terrell  oh terrible you mean terrible terrible shut up whatever it was but the whole country said it  one way so it's a tough shit for you don't correct us we don't know you personally we just hear  everyone else say your name like that if you start calling him ocho cinco i was i was telling right 
[02:08:30]  i was telling anthony on the break why you know i i love uh doing radio we just had our mind blown by uh  neil degross tyson and in a few minutes the contrast will happen we're going to have tammy  pescatelli in here with a horrendous accent telling guinea jokes and i say that with love i love  but there's a bit of a contrast right now that's that timeline yeah tammy don't take this wrong but  we couldn't have a bigger idiot coming in after that genius exactly she knows i don't mean it that 
[02:09:00]  way it's just so weird what happens yeah it's quite the dynamic we have on this program certainly is  i uh i went to i went to the dentist yesterday by the way i know it's getting close i posted a pic  how many days are we away from the big fake teeth it's not big fake teeth i'm getting i'm getting uh  uh like laminants veneers whatever they could they're not making it any bigger no they will  look exactly like it but they will be um wider cleaner clearer yeah i posted a photo of me getting 
[02:09:30]  the novocaine needle which uh i don't like that part but it doesn't bug me as much as it used to  because i'm kind of getting used to it i've made a lot of i pretty much um so far not even done yet but  so far i have a pretty nice uh car the cost of a car put in my mouth uh right now yesterday's visit  was uh alone was sixty five hundred dollars and we don't have insurance for this no no there's no 
[02:10:00]  dental insurance for this shit uh no but dental in general we don't have well dad you want to get  cavities filled i have to pay out of pocket it's crazy i have dental i don't have fucking dental  because we have to get our own insurance dental's very basic uh if they cover it what do they do with  the seven teeth you got pulled i did not have seven teeth pulled yesterday according to the  internet you did no that's a lie right yesterday was uh she's replacing a bridge that i have between 
[02:10:30]  a couple of teeth um so she took the old bridge out which was there from 1992 and uh did you smell it  no i didn't i did smell it burning though in my mouth she had to cut it out with the drill she was  going with this it felt like a sawzall was in my mouth she had to cut through the metal cup that's  inside the two crowns that um right that border the the fake tooth that's in between the the bridge 
[02:11:00]  and it's fastened to two other teeth by the way of a cap like a a fucking crown and that's metal and  it's glued in there and it's been there since 1992 so she's got to drill through the fake tooth  the metal and and then cut it out like that it was literally going  like like vibrating going and it was so loud uh in my head oh but it didn't hurt i mean she said if  you feel any discomfort let me know and then i was like no it's good and then it was like ow that 
[02:11:30]  hurt a little bit and she novocaine me up a little more and uh when are you gonna be done  uh about this a while the well now after now next in two weeks when they make up the new bridge  they pop that in and uh that's in two weeks and then i make an appointment to start on the uh  the fronts the the laminates i like the fact that you decided you were going to do this and you're just  fucking plowing ahead and doing it plowing right ahead it was because a wisdom tooth cracked on me 
[02:12:00]  and i went to get that fixed and i said you know what i'm here let's run the gamut there she is  we gotta get tammy in here run the gamut we also have john mackerow on his way so you're the progress  is yeah yeah so so it'll be uh yeah because i've never been happy with the discoloration that i have  going on in my in my maw so that's going to be all taken care of there she is hey paisan what's up  tammy good morning everybody good morning good morning how are you how you doing how how is this 
[02:12:30]  am i like the the cleansing of the palate after neil oh my god oh you heard that oh my god of course i  heard it i never felt so stupid well it was wonderful you're in a bad spot following him  yeah what a chasm right well i'm not in a bad spot to be funny holy god i just i just found myself  nodding a lot hoping he thinks that means i know something yes if you just nod a lot of the 
[02:13:00]  nerve is the new quarterback i'm sure tom brady thinks that every single time he's banging giselle  in the morning indubitably i felt like saying that a few times you know it's just so it's  i'm glad that there are people like that i'm just glad that i'm not one of them yeah what i mean  like he's so great he seems so nice he had a great sense of humor with you guys that he tried but  you know like you try to impress him and get his approval yeah smart you know what it is they're  just they like themselves too much as a comic like you know i'm a self-loathing narcissist like i can't 
[02:13:30]  right that's the comic yeah we just don't like ourselves as much to think that we could do that  kind of stuff right why do i want to go to earth to find more or offer to find more people to hate me  there's enough over here what have you been up to tammy uh apparently vigilantism on the train  this morning oh my god wow like this crazy guy i'm always nervous to be honest with you i'm never  nervous to do much because i've been on the road for a long time by myself and you know but the train 
[02:14:00]  always scares me in new york because i'm just not why i love it man no by that you mean the subway  yeah the subway yeah we call it the subway a lot of people know around the country they're like the  train you know they think yeah yeah you know the subway the subway easy urine smelling subway  i love going on the subway and watching people you gotta know where to go and you gotta also know  like maybe some of the spots aren't and you're a dude a white person you're a dude right you know 
[02:14:30]  that's the other difference like this guy gets on the train and he starts picking this little  asian lady and i don't even like asian people and he was picking up this little asian lady  saying how uh ugly she was and he was glad he didn't tell me his background and make i don't  know what he was he was one of those just generic brown he was brown yeah he wasn't black he wasn't  you know what i mean like he was no he was probably no probably white and homeless for too long oh you  know what i mean like you know that like that little timey it's like dirt yeah it's like break shoe ash 
[02:15:00]  yeah just that's all over him burnt pancake kind of like you know like like a wheat ego  and uh he was just gross and he was picking on her and you know i'm just looking you know because i'm  still novice enough to like take a look at it and and he goes what are you looking at and then finally  just go see i'm still trying to figure that out no i because i don't want to fight because it's not  you know he's obviously ballsy enough to do stuff to people but not to a man you know what i mean like 
[02:15:30]  it's still not like you're not talking to any of the dudes you picked on this little old asian  old asian lady and the most harmless thing to fuck with yeah what is she gonna do pretty much nothing  man she ain't even gonna pull out a stick and stab you with it  how did you respond when he asked you that well i just go i go dude not today  wow maybe tomorrow and then he goes what do you mean not today i said not today  and uh that could mean don't fuck with me today like hey because i'm busy today i gotta get to 
[02:16:00]  ona i mean not today if i miss this i'll never get back on again they'll just think i blew him  but but that means she scraps tammy scraps oh yeah well i i've had but that's a that's the thing  that you're a scrapper once in a while right i will oh yeah when i was a kid i used to really be  really bad yeah but i grew up with boys but also this is not a career that if i was afraid i could do  it i'm you know but what does the not today turn into was did he go away so then he just looked at me and  i go uh god bless you dude just like you know he was just he goes who are you to bless me and i it 
[02:16:30]  was so funny i took my hand and kind of moved it off like this right and he was and he shut up and  i was shocked that he shut up because i thought oh man i should just get my mouth shut not done  anything i was really petrified but he just shut up and then he got off the next stop and these people  these jaded people like were look i have it on video but you can't hear it uh they go this lady leans  over to me she goes are you a witch wow no i'm just a bitch really is all it is i just don't  have time to deal with him today maybe on the way home jedi mind trick that motherfucker no i just 
[02:17:00]  think no one stood up to him you know isn't it amazing that on a train with all those people and  i i i remember the public i'm guilty of this too if everyone had worked as one unit and just said  shut the fuck up exactly squash you everyone's afraid they're going to be the one he goes after and  then people know it's it's that but it's also nobody has faith that anybody else will help it's  gonna that's the truth and i gotta tell you i was scared shitless really but you can't the biggest  you can't do that the biggest problem with subway is you're facing people yeah if we all face the 
[02:17:30]  same direction there would be half the seats in the middle because you're facing people and they're  all there's some weird thing always happening that you want to stare at and then soon as you get  caught staring that's where the problem i also think there's just a level of apathy that is just you  know we're even apathetic to our own lives i'm like dude i'm on the subway i'm trying to figure  this out i got my own shit to worry about your level of crazy is cool apparently you got nothing  to do you can engage in fighting with strangers i have people that i live with i have to fight with 
[02:18:00]  on a regular basis you have a bag with them like a backpack of course one of those stupid and meanwhile  i was just laughing at people on like there was one of those you know like 55 year old guys with  the mets jack i love i mean i love that old people wear support their teams although you don't see any  giants jackets running around but it's the same in cleveland so trust me i grew up with all that  but like with their scooters i'm so sick of old dudes on their scooters you know jimmy looks so good  look how svelte you look with the cheekbones not today not today watch it i'm gonna use that not 
[02:18:30]  today for the first time i went to i went to a pearl jam show so i had a long subway ride to brooklyn and  and for i never saw this before in my life a black guy sitting across from uh uh us everybody on the  train i should say and he had a tattooed hairline man so you know and he thought he looked good he  kept looking in the mirror and like fixing the rest of his hair but for the first time he was  combing his hair with a sharpie and everyone was looking and he was giving that look like you know 
[02:19:00]  not today is basically what he was telling everyone with his eyes but we were all amazed because i've  never seen that before i've seen the tat i've seen the tattooed eyebrows that the women are doing  mostly the hispanics i think but this black dude had a tattooed hairline and it was about that thick  i'm showing these guys about an inch a huge stripe across his head no it didn't look natural of course  i was like what the fuck are you doing but as he was looking at himself in this mirror he thought he 
[02:19:30]  looked good and he was ready for whatever the fuck he was about to do there's a certain level like  i've always admired that level of crazy i always yeah it like i've always been jealous of the guy  who can take a nap on the sidewalk at two o'clock in the afternoon oh man i have a sleep number bed  and i have to have a wave machine and every like that is that's life to me like you have no worries  you can just drop wherever you are and sleep it's a beautiful thing but he's also dozing off with  shit in his pants it all comes out there's a fucking there's a balance 
[02:20:00]  that guy gets a good night of sleep but he's got shit in his pants and fleas  so do we sometimes so let's be honest we've all had those in the front let me explain  shit in the shit in the pants to tammy pescatelli we used to have this guy tippy tom he was a regular  on our show homeless guy one day we decided we needed to cut his underwear off to see what the  hell's going on in his underwear okay he had shit that was in his underwear that how many years jimmy  it was it had to be in there for testing on it it had to be in there for years know why we had to 
[02:20:30]  cut it out and it was petrified there's a video of it online somewhere and we we tapped it on a  table it was a rock you could actually put it in your hand and not feel like you're touching duty  anymore wow it was as hard as a rock it would fossilize whatever the fire it was an impression  of an old fern in it we should ask dr steve how the fuck that happens yeah you should have and how  do you walk around for that many years to allow that to happen that guy i mean i get a little swamp 
[02:21:00]  ass and i need to find a shower this guy's walking around and with the fucking shit in his underpants  to the point it turns into a rock yeah but i think you get to a point that you just don't care anymore  you know there's that night when you drank too much and you know like you you you puked and you  have like a little bit of puke on the side like you're like i don't care anymore just give me another  beer right like it's just done i like the way you think i it's been a hard life yeah now i'm a mom oh  you're married now right yeah yeah and then how old is your you have a son or daughter he's five  oh my son i'm a five wow wow i know who's smarter than me already and we like it i do i like him i 
[02:21:30]  don't know the process was something i was looking for you know what i mean like i don't think that i  don't think it's a good thing no i think it's being a mom i just well i just think that the whole  concept like i heard you yesterday talking about like watching the chipmunks thing with your kid and  you it's hard to back up i got trapped man well here's the hard part of all those things as you  see like he's cool now i can leave him alone with his shit but that one was too scary for him so he's 
[02:22:00]  like all right it's not even that it's like how many levels do we fuck them up like there's so many  things on a daily basis every crazy person was screwed up by their parents you know every killer  it's the mother that touched them or the the uncle that did something you know what i mean like  every drama so you worry like what did i do wrong then you can't watch those kids shows i was  watching the show the other day with my son and uh you know joey diaz joey coco diaz right the best  comic the nicest guy one of my good but like filthy he's on like this disney show just 
[02:22:30]  i have seen him with his face in a mexican strippers crock like i can't see you on the disney  channel this doesn't even make sense prior when he hosted sesame street it's like they have no idea  this guy's got fucking blow in his pocket right now right trying to touch the puppet  so you uh you you don't like the whole like process of having to watch those dumb videos and 
[02:23:00]  just being a mom i think it well i i like listen i love being my son's mom you know what i mean  because it'd be i just i don't like the other mothers you know what i mean like i can't do that  not like a hang with the moms kind of a gal i didn't grow up that way think about it i was with  i was with guys like you i was with jimmy i was you know what i mean so when they're like well what  are you gonna be for halloween gone that's what i'm gonna be i'm gonna be gone i'm gonna let someone  else take him around you do play dates and then realize no you want to hang out with these that's 
[02:23:30]  exactly what happened it's the worst that's that's no that's not okay i push my kid towards like kids  that i know i i'll get along with their parents right and then he picks the one i'm like no  okay i don't want to hang out you have to hang out with the parents they come over they want to  see your house they want to ask you questions and the kids don't even like each other terrible  we don't do a lot of play dates can't deal with it jimmy i looked for you i was in montreal at the  saint pierre fight oh yeah no i don't i've you don't leave the country for him anymore not for that 
[02:24:00]  i've never traveled for uh i've watched them here and i watched them in vegas but i wouldn't go to  montreal for only for the the festival but uh i'm glad you like ufc i love it i always do and  you guys introduced me do you remember the very first song i did watch it that was crazy it was  one of the greatest things i've ever seen last the the card last week for ufc  fucking velasquez uh dos santos but you know what it's amazing too is that jenny hutt oh that is jenny  i couldn't know she's waving is that what you've become in your life now a pretty girl goes by and 
[02:24:30]  waves at you and you're just like yeah she's not pretty trust me oh man she's all right they  gussie her up great on cnn she looks good in that little cube they put her up on the corner yeah she's  trying to hold everything together it's ready to fall apart oh wow really can't we just let her have  it yeah just she's can't we just open the door we'll let her have it thank god i feel good  i did that for you timmy actually i appreciate we like her she's all right oh they're talking about  the new she was she was kind of stupid on uh dr drew's show oh really that's not a redundant 
[02:25:00]  statement dr drew loves her dr drew who you know it's funny they just cast that new guy on 50 shades of  gray i never even read that i think that's who they are george wentz which is really weird  they got both of them they got norm and cliff who's who was playing the lead uh they just said  jamie doran or somebody they got rid of the guy from sons of anarchy i never read the books i think  it's just such a crock like it's reading stop you know what i mean like it's not porn yeah yeah i had 
[02:25:30]  a porn addiction before people were allowed to tell people they had a porn addiction i you know what i  mean like when you're embarrassed now these girls go do it what was your poison with porn well first  of all it was videotaped so that's how oh yeah so you know what i mean no online stuff no this was  the law this was i've been on the road for a long time online yes where where you'd leave it in the vcr  and if someone came to your house like i'd let comics come stay in cleveland when they were driving 
[02:26:00]  through and you'd be embarrassed because it would be stopped right at the point that you stopped right  and they would like know that that was your end yeah this was the finish this is everyone in 15  seconds that was it really  everyone knows what turns it on yeah yeah no what was your what was your point of choice there because  everyone everyone falls into a different weird genre subcategory that they kind of get addicted to  well i was pretty uh i was pretty mainstream compared to now i didn't know all those categories 
[02:26:30]  until online now they have every kind of weird thing yeah but it was more like high school kind  of thing like you know cheerleader school girl kind of no gangbang stuff a lot of women like gang  based stuff which is not my thing but for them it's such a departure from the way they really  yeah no because i think i feel i feel like i have to entertain everybody that's too much  that's too much i don't what what are you doing over in the corner you know i don't want to have  to have to deal with that it's like being on stage you're concentrating on the one person not having a  good time like hey are you all right i'll be with you in a moment you know like i couldn't that's too 
[02:27:00]  much work i don't think i could do that do you still watch it not really anymore it's hard i guess  with a five-year-old right well and i just see i think i'm done okay i'm pretty much done i i see where  it gets you you know what i mean like if if i once you have a kid it doesn't you're like that's what  this is for this is not as fun as i thought like if a yo-yo gave you responsibility you wouldn't  want to yo-yo anymore you don't want to do all that did you want to be a mom i know you're into 
[02:27:30]  it now of course i am now no it was never my plan i got pregnant by accident 37 it never happened so  you imagine i was like you're going through life like i'm good with not being a mom yeah well i and  then it happened i was in charge of my brothers when i was a kid like a lot all the time from probably  like they were six and seven years younger than me and i was in charge at age 10 so i think i had  had enough you know it just never plus i didn't really don't want to fuck anybody up that was my 
[02:28:00]  big thing 37 you got pregnant by accident my friends are shooting up like heroin addicts trying to get  pregnant and i'm like i'm the only one who like gets pregnant and starts crying you're not on the  pillow were you practicing rhythm or like how did that happen i was on the pillow wow yeah i i think  it just stops sometimes oh man that's fucking scary it's a big trick you're lucky uh you're lucky the  kid didn't need a the hockey helmet without the stick right well and that's the other thing they're  like do you want another one no because i dodged the bullet this time are you insane those eggs aren't 
[02:28:30]  as pliable at that age i am even thinking that i'm just fucking talking about it like she's  60 having a kid that's true were you tempted to not go through with it or the minute you found out  you're like i have to jimmy you the truth is uh yeah but i couldn't i'm not that person and i'm with  i was with the guy you know my husband but he's my boyfriend at the time and he's he was pretty  amazing and really cool about it and he wanted that i think if he had went the other way then i would 
[02:29:00]  have had to really seriously think about it you know we got one of those abortions my brother got  one for his all right but you know what was the hardest part is i had to hide it because no one  when i said i was pregnant i think i mean i joke about it in my act but it really comes from a true  statement most female comedians their wives have their babies for them so like we though i had no  no i had nobody to look at to go you can possibly do that at my level you know what i mean there  were some older comics that in bigger venues but i'm a club you know banging it out three days on 
[02:29:30]  the weekend comic i didn't know anybody like that who did that so how long could you stay on the road  for when you were pregnant listen i almost gave birth at governors i had i did the late show saturday  and had them on on sunday i didn't know that's true i swear to god that's true i didn't know i  thought i had three weeks but here i was having back pains and i was actually in labor i know i would  have had a better career if i had just shot him out right on stage and then they'd have docked my  pay yeah there's a comic you try to get the bonus for the extra person you brought 
[02:30:00]  doesn't that count yeah that puts me in uh you know bonus territory we're never booking her again  the last time she was here she had a baby at the end that's quite the finish though for the right to  the end my god and how long were you off for after that three weeks wow yeah then i had a  corporate and then i just won corporate and then i went back wow and i had a month you cleaning  corporates i can be i'm smart enough to know how to you know what i mean we gotta do an hour 45 minutes 
[02:30:30]  about an hour and 15. why don't the corporate gigs want the dirt i know it's so stupid well you know  they don't because they're just afraid they just they have too many hr people and meanwhile there  that's offended yeah most of the people in the audience would appreciate the probably but then  there's always that one they always cater to the minority but yeah but even the cool people would  be nervous to laugh in front of other people a lot of them when you're talking about whether it was  race or some type of thing they even if they're pretty open they'd be scared to laugh in front of 
[02:31:00]  their boss right or their co-worker it's just too much nonsense they'll just show up afterwards like  and you're in the go you know i thought it was really funny these guys like they don't think they're  better than the rest of the people they work with these guys right you do a corporate gig for like  some black owned small business corporation and you just tell the most horrendous racist jokes  right oh would that be great they're just they're just looking at you like what the  is this kind of do you think this is racist my my father we just had a huge your italian yes 
[02:31:30]  well it's so funny he goes he believes that wendy williams is tyler perry and he will not no matter  what i tell him he goes that's a tyler perry i know it is look it look at that's tyler perry  he totally believes that's a good theory that's a great theory yeah who's your father frank vincent  in jungle fever you know how i know that it's not though what a good dad he was you know how i know  that it is you know how i know because it doesn't say tyler perry's presents wendy williams 
[02:32:00]  it's like everything they do of course i never get cast in anything so i can say all this stuff  are you not a good jimmy you i don't i'm down to the wire actress i think they get a hotter younger  more experienced oh man and i get down to the wire it's always me and the chick that got the part  all right you know what i mean like i was you didn't you see oranges and new black yes yeah  i was down to the wire for that part uh the cafeteria manager whatever her name oh yeah that  bitch i try to throw it away but like you do it you know well she's pretty fucking she's great 
[02:32:30]  and but she's really good yeah i could never have done that she's good but she's a little gruesome  you know you don't come across as i just want to do one little get out and then it takes you out of  it too yeah i told you like with joey or or even the boys with lavelle and bill how happy i was for  them on breaking back but i hated to see them yeah it kind of took you out of it right like oh good for  the oh shit i want to watch this we're still looking for the guy yeah okay it's billy who 
[02:33:00]  the fuck is he looking who's he looking for exactly selling meth to de rosa  i don't like watching my friend i don't watch my friends on tv because a like you said you don't  have any it's an excellent point that i had to consider i was going in a different direction  but if i want to get down for me then yeah i guess get that brass tacks i'm alone you should watch my  career jimmy and then you'll feel better no but you don't want to see guys succeeding in a way  that you're not succeeding it's not out of dislike for them it just makes you feel like 
[02:33:30]  shittier yourself yeah i don't i read your book in the green room at the dallas improv and took it  back to the condo and had to call voss to cheer me up that's how depressed wow that is depressed  yeah that's a level of depression right i tried to call bonnie she wasn't available so i took rich  in the place and i said man this is i should just choke myself to death right now this is this  is the business i'm reading jimmy's feeling bad about mike i'm reading jimmy's book talking to voss  and feeling bad about how shitty my career is wow you didn't realize one man could get so many 
[02:34:00]  prostitutes i was actually feeling bad about like little like the level of success like you i know what  you're saying like i was happy for you but every time then i did the tonight show then i did this and i  did you how do you even get on the tonight show as much as you do and knowing who you are does jay  even know who you are it's really weird i mean he knows you yeah but i mean like does he know anything  about your act yeah i think so they they they let you do a lot more on that show than they do on the  other late night it's amazing some of the dirtier stuff i've done because he's a comic because he's 
[02:34:30]  a fucking working stand he's so nice he really is the nicest guy he's given comics chance forever  jesus yeah it's fucking dumbness relax you sound like a piece of shit no i didn't jesus christ  yeah you're right i never thought anybody of your caliber could actually perform at a venue that  would take the likes of jimmy and i i mean who are you that said dane talk to us as if you could  compete with our brilliance i love you oh we love you yeah they let you get away with a lot of cards a lot of uh 
[02:35:00]  dirtier stuff or innuendo it's really quite sexual or harsh they're pretty cool with that yeah yeah  that's great but i can't do most of my stuff there no no you gotta be a little clean i would love to  see the old people that see you on the tonight show and then come to see you oh yeah he's so funny  let me go see how that works out nice boy from the leno that's what happened to bob saying it everyone  thought he was you know a clean clean comic they didn't realize he's actually a really dirty comic he was 
[02:35:30]  not a wholesome show right yeah oh for sure he was that guy always when the fact is he changed  everything to be the wholesome guy and he was always a dirty guy right no i know but they didn't get it  and then when he went back to stand up i went to one of his shows then uh westbury and the people were  walking out like what the what is he doing this is not the guy we know right well and it was hilarious  obviously but it wasn't their cup of tea everybody thinks they can judge comedy too i think that's the 
[02:36:00]  whole level of chaos you know i had that lady throw that glass at me why yeah what happened  there oh man well it was about a year ago in jacksonville and uh she threw uh like a full glass  and it shattered behind my head and all but you know what it was just one of those do you remember  the joke that got no it wasn't even that she just wasn't paying attention the whole show she was one of  those women called her out so i i said to her i said man what are you what are you doing i go what are you  reading a book on your nook and she's like and she's like uh i'm watching porn and i go honey i 
[02:36:30]  wasn't trying to fight with you i said you're blonde and i said you were reading a book i was  obviously trying to be your friend oh man that's pretty good right there but if she just was you know  what it was it's that when i see monique god bless her she's a nice lady i don't really know  her that well i met her a couple times she's a funny comic but she has an academy award and she's  working the late show friday at a club i would impale myself with the academy award in front of  everybody i can't deal with these people on the late show friday anymore wait hold on she called 
[02:37:00]  her out was she with a guy she was a convicted prostitute jimmy probably know her oh yeah i love  her she was she and she just was tight wait what do you mean why would jimmy know her  oh okay no okay literal you got me with literal yeah something literal but i'm thinking that's a real  op moment that's a mayberry moment but i was thinking because you guys have done all the  same clubs you probably run into the same ass whatever now i'm trying to defend myself i'm an  idiot go ahead really she just didn't want to hear a woman like she was one of those women that need 
[02:37:30]  the constant attention right you know she was getting up to go to the bathroom every 36 seconds to  show off her outfit and oh and she was tired of me called her out and then what did she do after you  made your blonde joke she just threw the glass at you then she said no then she said to me uh not today  no no yeah she said not today motherfucker and she punched me in the throat um no then she said uh  um you make fun of your husband and your jeans are are cheap and i was like and i love him wait 
[02:38:00]  till you see what i do with you and uh then i turned and then she threw the glass right at me and that  was it because they threw her out of course no they didn't she just sat there like the sense of  entitlement of a white woman is beyond me like they didn't throw her out after breaking a glass oh no no  no no what had to happen at that point i had done all these uso tours and one of the  groups from iraq you've done those guys are loyal beyond when they see you over there these boys were  there they jumped up to get her the group of black women that i'd been hanging out with i felt like 
[02:38:30]  on stage came up to get her i stopped them and then finally they came to get her and then the cops  arrested her put her in the back of the uh car and then the sergeant came and said because it was  florida and he said um we didn't see it happen so and you deserve it you know he didn't say you  deserve it he said aren't you uh doesn't this happen to you all the time at your job i'm like no no  that's like saying somebody threw a punch at a cop hey isn't that just part of being a cop all the  time so she didn't get arrested she didn't get arrested and then it got picked up the story it 
[02:39:00]  was crazy i wrote this long blog it's just a long stupid story and the new york times talked about it  and the view and finally they called and said they were going to arrest her but the the the um  district attorney said to me he goes you know that you should just be used were you drinking  and i said does it matter if i was drinking yes it does oh look out i'm gonna go on stage tonight  with a bag of skittles and a short skirt maybe i'll get raped and shot maybe would that be okay 
[02:39:30]  how close did you get with the glass it bounced off the brick and smashed me right in the head oh it  did hit you and that's an absolute assault those lazy fucking cops in jacksonville didn't want to  or that's all it is just laziness yeah well i think she was an informant so the real cops wanted to and  then the sergeant came yeah and and let her there you go and let her off that was the craziness yeah  we got us some italian girl from the noah yeah they didn't take anything of it and you know it's just  i didn't even want anything crazy they kept going we'll sue her what am i gonna get her her die job money 
[02:40:00]  i mean what am i gonna get i don't want that just make it so she can never come back and she's  an informant she'll probably end up with a fucking garret around her neck yeah she's  she's got she's dying of aids and chlamydia right now anyways why wouldn't the club throw her out  because why would they jimmy why would they throw her out i fucking hate she's a paid she's a paid  you know patron yeah and they probably gave her free passes to come back the next time you know  i'm sorry that you had a rough time the shit you guys gotta deal with it's gotta be just insane 
[02:40:30]  after actually that club did they that guy who owned it once the owner came he you know the owner was  there the next day he was all on it but i think the the manager was a woman and you can't ask a woman  to do stuff like that ron howard's coming oh i'll get out of here okay go move over one it's like the  couch not the move come on take a seat hey ron how are you doing ron surprise surprise it is a 
[02:41:00]  surprise buddy very pleasant surprise how are you good to see you again man that's tammy pescatelli  a funny comic how are you nice to see you i'm jim really good actor he's a closer for sure he constantly  tries to sell himself and why not and why not directors that come in here you look you look thinner  you look good i'm uh you know what i'm doing a movie called heart of the sea which is a survival  story a true story and all the actors are on a reduced diet now i don't have to do this thing  oh man but somehow it's a gets a pretty good influence this with chris hemsworth all everybody 
[02:41:30]  very well what's the gist of this it's actually uh uh based on the the events that actually inspired  herman melville to write moby dick oh wow which is a whale ship was sunk in 1820 and the survival  story is the one that has was a big story of course in in its era but nobody knows much about now  and it's a pretty uh pretty remarkable adventure story so what exactly is that what are you eating  uh well i'm just i'm just being a little healthier i'm just being a little healthier that's really 
[02:42:00]  i'm just eating less of everything and a little more exercise it gets addicting though when people  start to notice it it feels kind of good to hear like a nice compliment and then you're like yeah i  kind of want to keep going are you fishing for one jim no no but i mean you know obviously uh  next step anorexia in the universe body dysmorphia hating yourself it's a nice road to write we didn't  know we were getting ron howard today you were in the building i guess i'm i'm uh yeah i'm here  today is that you filming outside no no no no no oh yeah they probably all the actors probably sit  up straighter when they see him there's a no there's tonight there's a screening project imagination uh 
[02:42:30]  10 short films uh and i've i've been sort of a you know a part of this this is the second the second  season uh of of this project canon sponsors it and it's been um you know it's been really a blast  and last year my daughter bryce made a movie and and it was a situation where um the you know the  the concept was people send in photographs for various dramatic categories you know a setting 
[02:43:00]  character and so forth and then those would get winnowed down by the public and then finally i would  select uh a one photo for each category and then in this case last year bryce had to go take those  take her inspiration from that make a movie and she wound up you know sort of an academic experiment  or a cool creative experiment she wound up making a very personal very interesting movie she even got  on the short list for the for the oscars last year they decided to do it this year and and and this  year they got five um celebrity filmmakers but people who are not known as directors or haven't 
[02:43:30]  directed very much yet and then they also opened it up to the public so tonight they're going to be  10 films and not only is it eva longoria and jamie foxx and uh and the other and the other  celebrities uh but it's you know it's also five five uh filmmakers who just took it upon themselves  to look at the photographs take some inspiration from that make a movie hundreds and hundreds came in  yeah i saw the commercials that were running for uh bryce and i were the judges on that yeah absolutely 
[02:44:00]  blown really by the creativity and that's honestly what i really like about the the whole the whole  project is it's it's it's terrific if jamie foxx gets to make a movie but it's not surprising if it's  going to be if it's cool right right but you know when you get these movies coming in ambitious movies  really incredibly creative incredibly entertaining uh and you realize that that's one of the things that  technology is doing isn't it amazing uh what's available to the the the amateur or layman uh as far  as technology goes stuff that wasn't available to professionals just a few years ago well and the 
[02:44:30]  whole thing is kind of blending because uh uh you know on on on the movie rush that's that that's out  right now the cinematographer oh thank you thank you seriously i really had a great time you gotta be  proud of that yeah no thank you thank you appreciate it anyway sorry well part of our challenge was to try  to you know um recreate this world in uh you know in a very authentic very personal intense particular  sort of way and uh we we wound up using cannons a lot not not because i came in and said you know 
[02:45:00]  i we got to use cannons but dot mantle who is extremely experimental and did a fantastic job with  rush really pushing the envelope and he always has using technology and and among among his tools and a  great solution for a lot of our problems turned out to be uh the cannon professional models and uh so you  know it's uh the two the two worlds are kind of are kind of blending no big uh what paniflex or uh 
[02:45:30]  not so much it is amazing we had all kinds of cameras i mean i bet yeah yeah and and and and again  that's what it was that's what was required and uh you know it was an interesting challenge because  speaking of technology we used you know every tool in the contemporary movie makers kit to try to  hopefully make audiences feel like they were just transported back into the 70s and experiencing  that world and and uh and those characters so it was a tremendous creative challenge and and uh and 
[02:46:00]  it was you know and it was it was made a lot easier due to due to technology have you seen technology  hurting the story lines at all or hurting some of the writing in movies i don't think so and and and a  lot of people say that going back to when digital editing first really you know came in 15 20 years ago  um and uh i personally don't but my mind sort of is attracted to variety uh options you know that's  why i make a lot of different kinds of movies absolutely the whole thing's kind of an exploration 
[02:46:30]  and so anything that makes the creative process leaner uh is also then naturally becomes more personal  and so for me i'm feeling that i i can get to what was in my mind a lot more often now than i could  even you know eight ten years ago yeah you because you've been through filmmaking throughout where you  had to you know sit there and literally cut the i've got my i've got my my eight millimeter splicer 
[02:47:00]  yeah so it has to i would almost think it leaves more time for the creativity to to not have to  worry that you're going to take such a chunk of time to to do stuff now that you could do a lot faster  it it ought to work that way but you know you know how it is with the man if they know you can do it  faster they want it faster they want it cheaper yeah yeah but what it does is i just think it creates a  kind of um fluidity i think i think there are you know there are more options i think the danger is 
[02:47:30]  if people start spinning so fast that they don't stop and they really think about what their story  is they don't think about an innovative way of doing it they just kind of you know they just sort  of blast into it and and and and do everything on the on on the fly that that style was something  that we applied to rush but it was not done on the fly right it was very conscious very thoughtful  kind of like the 3d technology when it first hit they didn't really care about the story as much 
[02:48:00]  it's just like wow now you can see movies in 3d and finally they're starting to realize okay people  are over that now we still got to make a interesting film well you know i don't know five maybe seven  years ago bob zemeckis a peer of mine and a friend uh he was great innovator you know he did uh who  framed roger rabbit if forrest gump back to the future movies you know always pushing the envelope um  visually but he gave a great quote which he said soon audiences are going to recognize that  visually anything's possible right and what's it going to mean it's just going to bring everything 
[02:48:30]  back to story and character and yeah you could look at them i mean there are movies that are visually  amazing and they're not good movies because the story is terrible and vice versa there's great stories  that use barely anything as far as uh effects go and uh that's great so it's always story driven i think  is the most important thing with with that said did you see gravity and what i haven't seen it i've  been i've been you haven't seen it it hasn't opened in europe yet and that's where i've been and uh so  i'm you know i'm i've heard nothing but great things i think it's visually just amazing stunning 
[02:49:00]  i think it's gonna i think it's a fantastic fall shaping up and and uh yeah do you have a love hate  with movies like that like because if it's one that you haven't done you're like ah that's great oh i hate  it because it's hard to watch it you know rush is a lot about rivalry and so so i've been thinking a little  bit about this as it relates to um you know in well anytime the award season comes along rush got a  lot of good reviews it makes you you know wonder where you you know would you be in are you on the  bubble which is you do care about that of course of course because it's better pride and and it 
[02:49:30]  means a lot to the movie and means a lot to the people you know in this case the editors did stellar  work the cinematographer fantastic work john zimmer's score is remarkable so there you know there are a lot  of categories daniel brule who played nikki lauda is you know just just did oh amazing career level  work so so you know you're you're you're not only rooting for the movie but you're you're uh you're  rooting for for those those people as well but but of course so you look at it and you see a movie a 
[02:50:00]  great movie and i'm still very much a fan so i don't see it and start resenting it it's the car ride  home where i say what does that what does that person know that i don't know damn it howard get  with it you've worked with uh tom hanks obviously uh uh did you see um captain phillips is great oh  yeah yeah i really i did see that that opened the end uh what he pulls off in that um like uh  examination don't give it away i won't i'm just saying it's it's amazing came back all you have 
[02:50:30]  to know is you know tom hanks is is he makes it look kind of easy but he's a dedicated artist and  he's a great talent and a great guy to work with but you know what what a year broadway you know i  mean he uh he's he's he's he's been given a lot of accolades but he deserves everyone that comes  as well you've worked with him early in like splash and then uh later on apollo 13 uh did what  kind of difference did you notice any at all in his acting or well i think in the beginning he 
[02:51:00]  really thought he was going to be a comedic actor right i think that's you know he began in theater  and then he made his breakthroughs you know in television and then movie comedies and uh it had  been about 10 or 11 years uh i we stayed friendly and i certainly saw all of his movies and i saw what was  happening uh to him he's broadening you know the kinds of roles he was tackling uh but when i  started directing him in apollo 13 it was interesting because the moments in between the 
[02:51:30]  dialogue the moments in between the scripted intentional planned ideas were suddenly rich and really  alive and to me that's sort of when he was it's and it was probably prior to apollo 13 he had become  a great great screen actor one of those guys that just that holds the screen because there's more  going on than just what the writer wrote yeah there's parts of uh when you watch him act that  you can tell it's it's him it's an odd thing there's this sense of humor that he has there's a scene in 
[02:52:00]  apollo 13 as a matter of fact when uh they're having that argument uh on board the ship and then he uh he  has to talk on the radio and he goes down real low back in control and that was so tom hanks it was  kind of a funny moment and uh well yeah that was really good acting is supposed to be bringing you  into the character which is yeah i wouldn't know i mean isn't it really i don't know what i trust me  well it's we just know radio tom's also a good writer and he's a good director and so he's he's uh you 
[02:52:30]  know he's he's as as as as all as all the great actors do they not only bring know how to bring  their character to life but they also really understand what's going on and they have a good  communication going with the director and and and they and a real sensitivity to what the movie  needs and the best actors not only show up and do a great job with their role but they also know how  to ask you know smart questions tough questions and keep sort of um you know they're sort of a creative 
[02:53:00]  x factor on a movie see what i feel the best method of acting is i like to let the other person finish  their dialogue i want to ask you a question with all this chaos that's surrounding some of these  young child stars that have trans you know uh ascended into adulthood and had all these problems  i mean you are the epitome of the child star but the success story what do you think was the 
[02:53:30]  difference for you i mean i i love how your brother's in it i mean i we just watched the  grinch talk about a kid we watched the grinch last night and you see clint and we just see all the  you know it's just great i love clinton guys it is tranya captain  that's my favorite part of just to find him and all that you know he's he's great he's a really really  good strong character actor and i you know look we uh our you know our our parents were were terrific 
[02:54:00]  and did a great job i don't really know because i you know this is just my life and it's and and  except that i i know i always liked it i never had confusion over it i never had ambivalence about is  this really what i want to be and this would even you know even when you know not to go to some place  but you when you're adolescent and you're struggling you're not getting as much work and  you know bullies are teasing you or or kids are you know or are are are hassling you they used to 
[02:54:30]  sing the andy griffith theme song while i was at the free throw line trying to shoot free throws  that stuff was never that was never too great a trade-off i mean right in other words i oh i  loved going to work and i love being a part of this creative process and um it's uh and and so i didn't  have that ambivalence i didn't struggle with that between uh the andy griffith show and happy days was 
[02:55:00]  kind of uh i guess not really i mean you were obviously working but not as much as well there's  a period time when you you reach a point where the child labor right right really impractical wow  because if you could get somebody who's over a certain age now it's i think lowered a little  bit to 16 there's kind of a margin but it used to be 18 if you could get somebody who looks say 14  or 15 that is 18 they can work they can work all hours just like any adult now but the 15 year old 
[02:55:30]  16 17 year old is still limited by child labor laws right it's a very practical issue and it it just  naturally sort of crushes any momentum yeah that shuts you out of roles obviously how are you feeling  about uh tv these days because tv is getting a newfound respect as far as uh shows like breaking bad and um  you were great on you were great on arrested development yes that was terrific i love being  a part of arrested development and and uh and and it's it's you know back to back to technology 
[02:56:00]  arrested development never would have come back had it not been first the internet you know then dvds  then netflix yeah you know it's it's uh um and without a without a question a television to me has  sort of evolved into this you know this this i mean it's always been great work is great work and  it's always right been there on tv but uh uh uh you know i i i love what's happening there as a  filmmaker it's it's i'm sure you see it's it's gotten a newfound respect where legitimate actors 
[02:56:30]  let's say are willing to do uh well tv for one thing they've shortened the schedule so that actors  don't feel like they're signing their entire career right on some kind of a treadmill yeah but in  writers as well um and also again back back to back to technology uh the television shows are able to  operate on a reasonable enough budget and yet be a little more cinematic a little more ambitious  and cable has allowed the freedom for them to to be as authentic and true to life as as uh as as 
[02:57:00]  movies so you know we're no question we're in a whole entertainment technology social revolution and uh  you know there's some it's it's exciting on a lot of levels it's daunting on a lot of levels it's  upsetting the economy in certain ways and you know and so it's i i don't know if people in the middle  of the industrial revolution or the renaissance knew what was happening to them at the time but in  hindsight but we're in it yeah it's exciting it's gotta go oh man yeah freaking out uh this was a nice 
[02:57:30]  surprise surprise thank you we want to plug uh uh p1 am i saying that right p110 goes live on yahoo's  screen p10 right oh p10 okay project imagination spelled wow oh that's great what a dope i just  sounded like you were blinded by how pretty she was that's all that's all that's all thank you uh  uh you know always fun to talk to you thank you so much thanks ron ron howard everyone we're going 
[02:58:00]  to take a quick break stay there the op anthony show on sirius xm  the op anthony show continues  tammy yes we kind of blew you off oh what's the plug because we got john mackarow coming in now  uh my netflix special next friday okay netflix uh next friday tammy pescatelli hi john what's 
[02:58:30]  up john what's going on how's it going from mackarow tammy this is uh john john mackarow how's it  going do you do you remember when we did your tv show i remember that remember that i didn't have  that many guests that was fun we had a good time that was fun man it was fun how long did the show last  six months six months six months what do you think what what doomed it was the network kind 
[02:59:00]  of telling you not to do what you wanted to do or maybe i wasn't um given the proper amount of time  like some of these other people actually i signed to do it on cnbc because i knew that no one was  watching cnbc at 10 o'clock at night so i figured i'd get like at least a year if not two to figure out  how to do this because it's different obviously asking the questions it is answering them right  it's trickier you know so so i figured this was the perfect vehicle to try to but then they seem to be 
[02:59:30]  like it had to be done quickly i know it's old news but they should have gave you a a real chance  you on tv is always good yeah the uh the co-host it was like uh before the show  i can't even hear myself think here there it is so the uh the co-host right before this guy uh  we were like look this isn't working at all this is just we got to get somebody else and they're  like no no i think this will work right and it just was like complete oil and water wow yeah and 
[03:00:00]  then and we got to get somebody out no no and and all the producers were like we got to get rid of  this guy but there was somebody he must added some info on some people one one other point that we  can move on to other things we we've been lucky enough to do a few tv shows in our careers you had  the scariest audience ever i don't know where they i don't know where i don't know where they  i don't know where they bust them in from only half of them are homeless it was homeless it was 
[03:00:30]  homeless and crazy people there was some guy right in the front row that was like stink eyeing us the  whole time wow i would have protected you you should have called him yeah right yeah it was okay we're  over new jersey you know yeah that's not the easiest place to get an audience to get some live audience  if they got the next movie that will farrell was in although he was nice enough to be my first guest  which was nice all right yeah it wasn't like all right let's do the mackner show forget letterman and  right now jimmy fallon and yeah since you did interviews and you and you had to go kind of 
[03:01:00]  like work that muscle do you find that you do you give interviews any different because since i've  been doing this when i do interviews now i find like i know what the other guy's going through on  the other side so i try to fill the space a lot better than i would have before i did interviews  on the other side yeah i think you understand the the the good guys if you're doing well let you do your  thing letterman was always great at that he seemed to be able to sort of sense if you needed a little  bit of a help or a no and if you seem to be going rather well he'd he'd sort of sit back 
[03:01:30]  and let you do your thing so the easier ones were when guys that came on with a lot of energy or  yeah yeah knew what they were doing it's the guys that were sort of or girls where you felt like  you were pulling blood from a stone we call it and then i'm like wait a second that was where  because people were saying look you got to get be yourself more which i felt like eventually i wanted  to sort of do some of that i didn't want to just go you cannot be serious 
[03:02:00]  the first line come off as insincere yeah so and and also it wasn't that easy getting guests so  a lot of people were nice enough to come on including some people i knew  or had had known for many years or seen like an elton john was nice enough to come i'm not gonna go  blast the guy you know he's coming he's going out of his way to come on this show you're gonna just  yell at him so tell us why did you really get married that time you know  so it just seemed like it never had a chance to figure out what to do i mean with an audience 
[03:02:30]  without an audience i i'm obviously not a comedian but i thought it's what i always liked about shows  like late night shows or talk shows is when they come on and do a couple jokes sort of loosen people  up yeah and i wasn't pretending i was going to be letterman or leno or jim whoever else jimmy fallon  even he's not a stand-up per se but he started to do it and or maybe was he a stand-up well i worked  with jimmy right before he got snl yeah i think he was a younger stand-up though so forget i said that 
[03:03:00]  i sort of wanted to do a little bit of that at least do some skits i always thought the first five minutes of  a show should be funny and bring people in and lighten them up and they didn't seem to really  want to do that you're not a comedian yeah that's true but if we did something funny but we had no  writers you're a funny guy five months of the show no writers at all none i'm like how david letterman  who's a brilliant comedian's got 15 and i'm some ex-tennis player i've got none none so uh how does i 
[03:03:30]  i didn't know that finally in the last couple uh months of the show we we got a couple writers  that we were able to hire while trying to unload some a couple people that didn't seem to be fitting  that well with the show how much stress were you feeling knowing you had no writers to kind of help  you out a little bit i'm definitely feeling some stress i think the toughest part was doing so many 
[03:04:00]  three four or five shows a week right i mean you guys probably know something about that but on tv  when you sort of come on and and and you feel like you're constantly doing homework because i  wanted to sort of feel like sorry i'm not looking over that way that's okay no i don't yeah this  console set up like that sort of setup this snob yeah all right it's a guy set up i don't take it  that's right i don't take it i don't take it she doesn't really matter but it's tough to even sort  of know a lot about you want to feel like you want to ask something that not everyone has asked  and you feel like you're constantly doing homework what was that i missed i said that she doesn't really 
[03:04:30]  matter anyway that's right i'm not gonna go there sorry you mean watching a movie just because that  person's coming right reading a book just because they're coming exactly which in some cases is good  but if a book stinks oh there's nothing worse than plowing through a dog this was a really  boring book but we just make believe we didn't see the movie a lot of a lot of times we're forced to  see the movie or read the book and if it stinks we'll just make believe it's like oh yeah we're gonna  catch it or or if we don't like it then we'll definitely bring up how bad the movie was have 
[03:05:00]  you have you oh god yeah because we do this every day we we kind of do things just to kind of entertain  ourselves it's put someone in a tough spot in this room or you find the one good thing in the movie  like what the jackets  john you're uh promoting dove are you the new spokesperson well i am the new spokesperson for the  dove campaign dove men's plus care deodorant oh no right anti-irritation so i sort of fit into that 
[03:05:30]  i get that but but actually i mean in some cases uh it makes sense and to me this one does because  i'm part of doves a big sponsor of the marathon okay this so we're sort of focusing in i did some  online videos and commercials on to sort of promote the after what happened last year not  even having the marathon yeah earlier this year with boston i think this brings an added significance 
[03:06:00]  to this one being spectacular and great so for me being a new yorker all my life living on the upper  west side going to the marathon watching it seeing these lunatics run 26.2 miles the idea of sort of  doing partnering with uh uh men plus care seemed to make sense and i got to be a coach and not have  to do the marathon this year so if they like what i do maybe give myself a year possibly i mean i'm  pretty fit but i'm not fit enough or oh man quite wacky enough to run that type of distance so maybe 
[03:06:30]  next year i like seeing this version of you because you live in our neighborhood i see you a lot and you  are so not approachable that's not true wow it's just you i guess the days when you're approaching  me all the time you got you got the you got the hat the glasses and you're like he's got somewhere to  go no i don't mean i don't even mean that in a bad way i don't even mean that in a bad way but wow i  like this version well then you may where do you live on the up west side yeah near the river okay so  to me there's more and more buses tourists coming along and i sort of feel like i'm coming back from my gym 
[03:07:00]  or workout or in the park and then they go and walking up the street now is john mackerel  i just don't want them to say either a like they're taking pictures of b who the hell's john mackerel  i need to hopefully get a little bit of solace during that time where i've had a good workout  walk back home sort of i love this city but it gets it's getting a little hectic and seems to be more 
[03:07:30]  crowded than ever i don't want to confuse it i i understand i mean i understand  that you don't want to be bothered all the time that's all i'm saying and by the way i actually  probably which is the good news 99 of the people who do come up to me say nice things yeah which  the percentage has gotten better over the years yeah it wasn't quite 99 for a while  i used to love watching you play tennis man i think a lot of i love that documentary that they just did 
[03:08:00]  recently about thank you fire and ice and i love you happy that bjorn was bald he is yeah he's bald  now no he isn't i wish he was no no no no he's not bald at all he's got a great head of hair  no it's all you must be thinking you must be well it's short but it looks like it's  he's talking about she's talking about bjorn board we did a documentary fire and ice it was on hbo  about a year year and a half ago and it was great to to do that especially with bjorn because we have 
[03:08:30]  this incredible history and only guy that i've ever played against probably that i didn't have a  problem with you know we didn't get into some type of fight on or off the court so we had a lot of fun  together on especially memorable matches off the court we had a lot of fun great friends so to be  able to do this now but he's got that sweet hair i'm very envious of his hair he could grow it long  yeah absolutely why did you have a problem with most of the guys you uh played that's how you get  become a great athlete is he you're competitive as my psychiatrist now 
[03:09:00]  we're yeah that's probably how you become an elite athlete let's move to the couch over there  and uh yes it's a little uncomfortable this chair who hurt little johnny it was great to watch though  that's right you know i hate all the sportsmanship it's too much i did have i did have the since  this is satellite and you guys like racy stuff i'll give you and jim mentioned this that as a  i was brought up catholic i'm going to say something i never told anyone 
[03:09:30]  a number of years ago the priest that was in my parish was arrested for wow inappropriate  activity so and and i was unaware of this uh oh so my mom calls me and says john uh did you hear  i'm not going to mention names did you hear about the father and i said no i didn't well he  he was arrested for you know child molesting etc so i go god that's too bad that's that's horrible 
[03:10:00]  i mean i never would have thought that with with him and then she says there was this hesitation  then she said did he ever do anything to you and then i realized jim that could have been my out for  everything i've ever done and sometimes we still get together maybe you're angry because he didn't 
[03:10:30]  did you uh recently it came out that uh that people saying that bobby riggs had thrown that  big all right right gene king did you well we always thought that oh you did we always thought that because  he he's a huge gambler i mean i played bobby riggs in golf once me and arthur ash beat jimmy  connors and bobby riggs in golf and they wouldn't pay us they said let's keep playing another nine holes  we don't want to play anymore we want the money no no way and then they wouldn't you're not paying  us well that's because you won't keep playing so it was he was one of these guys that always was 
[03:11:00]  hustling and he beat margaret court who happened to be one of the top female players before he played  billy jean king badly but he was a rather agey guy actually he was somewhere in the neighborhood  of how old i am now i think he was 55 56 possibly when he played billy jean king and the way he played  how pathetic he performed um made guys believe or maybe we wanted to believe that this pathetic 
[03:11:30]  performance was due to the fact and we were rumor had it that he had done this now took the  having now now at 54 years of age and the body sort of giving out more often you can see why  there'd be certain days where it wouldn't be that great a day where you could possibly have had a bad  day and i would say that it's a little bit harder to say definitively that did happen although i'd like  to check his bank account and see let's see but i think money down on a her yeah well it turned out 
[03:12:00]  great for i mean obviously girl sports i mean i have four four girls and two boys you raised them  all right i did raise them all you can not not by myself by patty smith and i've been together for  19 yeah six kids wow two two marriages yeah so that that is a loud dinner table wow yeah yeah because i  had all the kids you know i had full custody of the three i had retained for a long time 15 the last 15 years  years um and so there was some definite energy flowing at the table a lot of yeah maybe possibly 
[03:12:30]  yelling and screaming a bit but in a loving way right yeah yeah loving way yeah in a loving way  it's great to have kids it keeps you sort of some sort of good perspective what about you jim what's  your story never had kids never even came i feel like i'm i realize what it is i'm a i'm a sex addict but  b i think i'm afraid of uh like once you get married once you have kids then adulthood starts  even though i know intellectually where i'm at in my life i'm fucking close to being finished but 
[03:13:00]  i'm just it scares me to acknowledge that in a way that's undeniable like with a kid you can't  deny that that kid's getting older and you're getting older i think that's what's freaked me out  or maybe i'm just selfish i don't like well that's it yeah yeah me too it's probably very  what about the fact that you're not going to have a a little one don't you want to have someone  like a little jim norton i don't know it's only good wouldn't that be unbelievable to see that  it's kind of cool see if the apple didn't fall far from the tree yeah just a check it's kind of cool 
[03:13:30]  i got i got two oh my friends are all happy that moby's got one but anthony and colin quinn  are my last two holdouts of people they're going to have one together  we're working on it we're trying every day colin is fighting homosexuality at every turn  because colin's not married and uh he has no kids and spin married but he has no  so a couple of my friends are still holding out but um yeah i i don't know i just got a kitten  you prefer hookers and uh strippers right you know what i hear all your stories and it just sounds 
[03:14:00]  like you've never been with a girl that hasn't at least stripped from what i've heard i don't know  if that's true or not but i think you're right imagine in a normal maybe they are normal yeah  there's no k-mart cashier that wants i think you're right there you got to give me an answer to that  though and before i always wanted to ask you that it's uh what was the question the question was have  you ever i mean you obviously prefer strippers and hookers sometimes i do but sometimes no there's 
[03:14:30]  i like it it's hard for me because my threshold is so high with what i need to to not even to get  off but just to be stimulated that it's hard to find regular girls who can kind of go to that but  i've had a few girlfriends who just read men really well and a girl who can like own you that's what i  want and usually women in the sex business understand the male mentality enough to kind of know what you  want and i don't even mean just sexually but like mentally when you're fantasizing that's that's 
[03:15:00]  the physical side of a relationship have you ever felt like you've been in love he doesn't respect a  girl once she goes to that level have you ever been in love with a regular girl i love my ex-girlfriend  very much i loved the girl before her who was just a really nice girl and not a pervert i loved both of  them tremendously and truly but my selfishness overrode my love while you were loving them truly were you  out with strippers and hookers well that's a funny point you raised you know not to get away from the 
[03:15:30]  topic you're not wrong this would have kept the show on the air you had the wrong guess it doesn't  irritate especially with the things i was doing irritation so when things get a little right i would  have rubbed up the odor in my mouth it might have been more for your girlfriends but this is you know  guy deodorant sorry well i i uh yes but i did do things i shouldn't have done but i still love them  because the way i looked at is when i was drinking i stole from my mother and my grandmother to to  drink i stole from my father to drink and i love them so it's like sometimes you cheat in a relationship 
[03:16:00]  you still love the person but just serving that other need becomes so much more doesn't mean it almost  made sense that's that's the same rap he gave them before they left exactly that's a great point  when they found that inappropriate text i'm like let me explain this goes way back it's me showing  you gotta give it a shot roll the dice yeah i'm a bit upset because when shaq was uh promoting dove  he he gave his product john mackerel man i think there's product around for you guys all right okay 
[03:16:30]  i want to make a different they do the real woman campaign for the women right they have those pictures  of those chicks that are just regular in their underwear and this timing is good for me though because  my wife recently started to say hey listen maybe you should start wearing some deodorant  so thankfully dove men plus care i mean you know you have a strong scent i love it honey but  did you know with the woman for years there was a period of years where i didn't wear it yeah i went  on natural what was that was there a thinking behind it did you not like what it what it did to you or 
[03:17:00]  did you just not care about a combination of it just not into it this you know people are getting  stronger and stronger sense and didn't seem to be working as well but i finally found the right  anti-irritation anti-perspirant formula there it is yeah so that's it's it's it's good timing because  uh i use all dove products because of shaq he came in here with that stuff i tried it for the first  time using the soap or the it was the uh the other and the soap he brought it was the body uh soap or 
[03:17:30]  the other yeah there's a few things i use the deodorant i know that it was great and the deodorant i use  yeah and uh i with the deodorant i'm weird like i like sometimes when a woman doesn't wear it oh if  the chemistry no but i do wow laughing of course but if the chemistry is right i love that i don't  want to i told girls if the chemistry is right i'll bring it over my house wow if it's not right that's  brutal yeah but you don't want to be the person like that anyway that's got that foul awful scent that  you that's nature just telling you like don't reproduce when they're barking you're talking about a blubber 
[03:18:00]  below the marking moldy yeah just somebody being you know clean everybody knows and you know when  you stink they want clean yeah take a shower i don't mind i like clean i like clean but a little  natural is kind of sexy we used to have guys in the tennis circuit back in the day i mean things  are tough in a lot of places but in these countries where i guess they didn't have access to  running or hot water that often they'd play a three-hour match they come into the locker room take 
[03:18:30]  their clothes off they get a little deodorant spray it on and no shower oh wow wow that must i mean  it was it's like wait a second yeah hey we're we we got some hot water you can take a warm bath that's  horrible and the smell after like three four days of the shirt yeah oh yeah that that musky awful  people get that sometimes they leave their clothes in the in the washing machine too long before drying  and that mildew smell it's like fucking terrible do you uh do you still play tennis i still play i'm 
[03:19:00]  with jimler um no i actually still play quite a bit i play on sort of an old fogey seniors i try  to be hopefully the rolling stones of the tennis court i mean they're doing pretty well right so  it's you look at the acts that are still out there it's incredible so that's sort of we i go out with  borg or it now agassi got like guys sampras i think guys ranging from a few years older to 10 15 years  younger right because there's a lot of you uh top athletes when you leave your sport you you don't 
[03:19:30]  even touch it anymore well tennis is one that you could actually play that i don't understand right  no no i meant you know like you'd have to find people of your caliber to play because you can't  just play with us well i have a tennis academy up at randalls island for example where i'm trying to find  the next great american player and try to nab some athletes that play basketball or football and try to get  them into tennis which is not it's it's not very affordable and accessible and other things that's 
[03:20:00]  a whole other topic but uh certainly um it would be nice to bring the buzz back it's sort of to me i  mean it was a great time in the 70s and 80s part of the problem is obviously there's a lot more choices  on tv there's i mean if you had told me that i our ratings would be half of what golf was i would  have laughed at you when we were playing and we get sometimes outrated by chess or poker jesus christ  so you got to go out and reach out and grab fans i mean it's a great sport but we haven't done nearly 
[03:20:30]  enough so we've sort of fallen back a bit and the best best athletes and in our country aren't  necessarily playing tennis well that excitement factor is is not there i mean well obviously when  you were playing it was fantastic that the unpredictability now there's so much political  correctness and and if somebody even goes a little off kilter or says something weird there's this  apology tour they gotta go on and then so everybody it's taken that that spontaneity and and and fun and 
[03:21:00]  unpredictability out of uh a lot of you know when in baseball the guy i mean you saw it i don't know if  you saw the game last night but they made that brutal call in the first inning or whatever and  then both managers come out and they're screaming and people love that right but they don't have  the the mic right there they're not probably not saying hello how are you right that would be the  great job pal yeah but but we don't have the power for whatever reason i mean if you're on a football  field during the jet new england game something tells me that they're not out there when they're 
[03:21:30]  banging into each other saying uh good hit yeah yeah i mean they're out there saying things that  aren't printable or you don't want to hear no but everyone would love to hear that but well they'd  love to hear it but it's almost in a way it's sort of nice if you don't but you know that it's  happening you know it's happening right right in tennis they heard everything we were saying  magnified so it was like oh my god john mackenough said shit i can't believe this  yeah yeah you suck you know to the umpire and all of a sudden i'm a teller the hunt 
[03:22:00]  meanwhile you're right every other sport they're saying things ten times worse and so we weren't  protected but and so then they thought it was like oh the inmates are running the asylum me and connor's  and nastazi so they have to like stop that right which i think was a huge mistake instead of sort of  shifting and handling it a different way it's also because tennis and things like golf are individual  sports like a team sport doesn't really need the help but i think the individual sports  they need a couple of personalities yeah that almost rise above the sport which ropes people 
[03:22:30]  in and you did that for tennis i think uh uh tiger did it for god i think i had part of it were very  very intriguing in tennis but it's a great story you don't have enough big personalities in tennis  lately you have to encourage personality which they discourage you're totally right like boxing what  you want to know what's wrong with boxing they're all guys that seemingly they're from like kazakhstan or you  know russian people you know i mean they're good fighters but you don't have a good personal 
[03:23:00]  back story or connect to them right yeah we do need in a sport i mean it helps if you have a great  american right now we have four of the best players maybe the two greatest players that ever lived nadal  federer but it doesn't have that same sort of interest level even though they're incredible  that if we had a american in the mix that was sort of battling these guys i think obviously it helps  so that's why it's so important to find some we like uh knowing the personalities of people 
[03:23:30]  and having them be different not just robotic sports players but they they do they they kind of  take that and squash it you know in football you know they don't want to spin in the ball or  celebrating or anything it's kind of look what they did to terrell owens i mean whether you liked  him or hating it was a personality and they took it right out of him all those wait a minute they did  i mean i i know when you're intimating but i don't think they took it out of him but he he probably  would have been better off playing tennis because he's an individual in like a team game but he was 
[03:24:00]  about you know i think some people would say that he it was about him i think it was pretty safe to  say that this guy was a phenomenal athlete that was a great football player maybe borderline hall of  fame player but he was all about terrell owens it may be that way he himself got it was got it was  out it's out of the game because finally they got numerous chances by numerous teams and it continued  to be more and more alan iverson in baseball and exactly alan iverson himself but another person was 
[03:24:30]  a great he was a great athlete when he played the game so was alan iverson alan alan was a great  athlete but i think he wasn't he wasn't xed out by the management you should have a we'll we'll do  a poll who's more about themselves alan iverson terrell owens and try to come up with a couple other  individuals it goes to your point though it's individuals in a team sport you're wanting some 
[03:25:00]  publicity right and then you have to change your number uh do you um your your wife she's still uh  she's still uh well she hasn't done much i mean with the six kids that we've had together being  has complicated things but uh we've been together 19 years she's actually i mean she should be doing  this more to me because she's she's one of the few people that i've seen at her age that still hit  the notes and right right the same what key that she's saying when she's saying goodbye to you 30 years  ago you know and we always rock and she's also looks good still and she i mean so to me she i'd i'd like 
[03:25:30]  her to get out there but obviously it has to well she's done she's done she's written a lot of  great songs to me i hear these songs that she's written i'm like get it out there but obviously in  this business now it's difficult to know how to do it yeah that's true the way to do it the right  producer a different business it's so different that and i'm just like just do it oh yeah i mean  i'm it's easy for me to say am i getting kicked out or no no you're your people oh i guess you're from 
[03:26:00]  all right hopefully patty will do a record and you guys have her on would be awesome oh you'll have  no there's all these great great tunes yeah it's uh dove men care yeah you know they're saying even  another interview dovemendcare.com and um you know i really like john mackenroll a lot john's uh  a lot of come back and see us what's your uh what's your uh are you on good terms with the ex-wife uh  or it's always it's always up and down with you guys we're in pretty good terms we don't talk at 
[03:26:30]  all that's great do you throw something through the tv when like paper moon comes on well paper  moon was a great movie paper was a great movie it was the reality show that probably her first two  movies were bad news bears and paper moon great so that's a hell of a start that is a hell of a  and when we met she was 20 and i was 24 holy shit yeah and so she's about uh i'm going to throw her  under the bus here a little bit but she's about in a few weeks to turn the big five oh right 
[03:27:00]  and so to me she i am part of this i'd like to say it was all her fault we had three kids in five  years and she was 22 to 27 so when i look back now when i have friends perspective i'm thinking that was  a lot to throw on anyone's plate uh-huh particularly when she's got like as insane a situation that she  grew up with so i try to have some sympathy for what i threw her into as well as i was throwing  myself into we didn't know it's interesting the fact that you were like the the bad guy that was 
[03:27:30]  taking america's little sweetheart and corrupting her or being like who you are and then do you feel  like any kind of uh redemption after a while that people actually went wait a minute she was a little  batshit crazy and fucking john's pretty good guy that wasn't a bad way to end it  he really has to go thanks so much for coming to see you guys take care  tammy where you where you at we're out of here today awesome netflix next next damn it

[03:35:30]  someone shot the lens with paintballs before she fucking takes uh takes the camera i do think of  you a lot of the time when i'm on doctor's show because yeah it's true because i know over the  summer we had back and forth about it yes we did well during the trayvon uh zimmerman trial but i do i  try to really be um fair and just honest whatever opinion that i'm having i'm glad you're starting  that after the zimmerman thing because you sure weren't uh during it boy you gotta give me credit i  fucking called that from day one you did i called that acquittal total acquittal you did none of this 
[03:36:00]  manslaughter shit that everybody was knocking around even though i i they were they were in mourning  at cnn after that fucking uh acquittal and i don't know what was going on at msnbc they were  fucking horrified over there it was a dark day but uh you're now at the point where you're bragging  i felt about this trayvon martin thing well you know what i was the one that called it because i was  the only one looking at it logically reasonably you were looking at it from a legal perspective and 
[03:36:30]  i think oh silly me no no the rest of us i think very emotional yes like women tend to be  emotional person and yours ginger so they're a lot more emotional so i'll add them in my 40 i'm  40 don't say don't sit there and say aunt wasn't looking at this emotionally because hatred is an  emotion is an emotion well that's true we'll give you that and there was your tweets yeah they come  out in the evening they're emotional well no they're also based on facts of uh statistics of a race and 
[03:37:00]  crime in our country and all i do is uh i i i relay that to people that might not know or want to know  the the facts of the matter that uh you know i'm sorry blacks uh are 50 percent of the prison population  yet 12 to 13 percent of the population violent crimes committed on a much larger scale um especially  when you look at it per capita percentage-wise um between blacks and whites so you're saying blacks  are unfairly targeted black on white crime is a lot higher than white on black crime yet white 
[03:37:30]  on black crime will get the publicity in press uh and meanwhile on a daily basis you could read about  savage crimes that happen against white people perpetrated by blacks and it will never make the  news so you taking notes over there hut i want that i want that word on dr drew savages is what he said  but i also want to know yeah you said you're 41 i'm 43 43 you look great and uh is that still natural  hair no i color my hair now do you is it mousy brown and gray i think it's just gross is it mousy

[03:46:00]  wine and sit there and play with little beavis that's it let me ask you a question about the  molestation yes sure we're back to that your family's got tons of money i would have thought  that like like if i was a billionaire yeah i the power is make it up assertions that are  he's probably your family's like got billions and billions and billions of dollars so if i had that  kind of money you think those people like to have like power like did your family use like any of their 
[03:46:30]  influence to make sure that this guy who made you jerk him off when you were five years old  paid for it did they do i think he got in a significant amount of trouble but this is going  back to 1975 so i don't man it was it was pretty much legal back then yeah yeah but they could use  some cash to ruin the guy's life once they found out yeah i it's unclear but i do believe he got  and the hut fortune use the hut fortune to go after him why else have a hut fortune i know by the 
[03:47:00]  way our father hooked up with samuel finger that is where the fortune comes from really might have  heard finger hut yeah that's the big fortune right amazing yeah amazing a lot of money there you could  have had that guy fucking like snuffed whacked out oh yeah do you think your family might have had him  killed no do you know what happened to him so he could be dead he's not i don't think he's dead  did you ever see him after that no i did not did he live in the neighborhood i think he lived in the  neighborhood i think he was messed up he was eyeballing you for a while oh yeah oh this 
[03:47:30]  wild little henna head i'm after her friendly oh god what a dangerous combination what a mistake  parents nowadays they make their kids so paranoid yeah it's not it was just you know don't talk to  strangers you know why now you gotta say don't talk to them or fucking jerk them off in the woods  it's true yes yeah because uh we're now in a society where we admit that people molest kids 
[03:48:00]  and they're right bad yeah yeah yeah do you watch homeland oh i do but this season's not that great okay  no why there was just a storyline that involved a man love boy love whoa did it involve the lead  guy that was in band of brothers no he was he was great he was great in band of brothers i thought  he was american and he does that english accent and fucks you up it's like the whole cast of walking  dead they're all british oh no fucking zombies right got to go a lot of zombies yeah and then they 
[03:48:30]  fucking they get on the show and they're they're regular regular american real real they speak like  real people you know the huts had that got killed oh i guaranteed that's why she never saw him again  yeah that's that money that's like when that that neighbor ran over uh john gotti's kid yeah and then  they just they threw him in as though that was the name i grew up with the huts the hut family fortune see  that that's the hut house over there um that's the hut estate that's right over there but uh but the

[03:52:00]  at christmas it's like you look around and it's all different colors everywhere oh yeah even the  most festive of jews yes it's just going to be a bunch of blue lights just blue just blue white candle  lights yeah it's terrible no good it's a terrible holiday where's the thought for the aesthetic the  kids must hate it well this year it's really different because this year it's the first time in like  78 years all right and thanksgiving are together which is weird yeah yeah which is weird are you a 
[03:52:30]  little jewy right you're a little jewy we're not religious at all uh-huh but did you grow up  celebrating uh hanukkah instead of christmas bat mitzvah my brother was bar mitzvah oh okay  why didn't you get it was it because they were so mad at you for being molested they were and they  wouldn't give you a bat mitzvah i didn't i didn't go to hebrew school oh boy so we're not my kids  at where bar did you resent um kids that got to celebrate christmas instead of no stupid hanukkah  no no no i was right no yeah because we were always away christification and now it's even 
[03:53:00]  earlier like they're gonna be celebrating thanksgiving so all the little jewish kids  a month later are gonna see everybody else being like it's the greatest most wonderful time of the  year yeah yeah nothing it's over for them and you go to the movies if those blacks keep trying to  pitch that fucking kwanzaa that shit just ain't taking off i'm sorry you see kwanzaa and then  the tv stations try to do it a very merry christmas and happy kwanzaa and you're just like it's so 
[03:53:30]  forced you won't let the blacks have anything i'm like anytime they try to start a little something  for themselves here's old man kumi and try to stop it laugh at kwanzaa though no one wants to celebrate  kwanzaa it's not bothering you it's like oh there's there's like these rules or something they got  to read what is kwanzaa about like there's this set of fucking things like uh oh respect your  family and your neighborhood and stuff it's like i don't want rules i want fucking presents look i do  love that we are doing our holiday break holiday break on october 24th well just like most of the 
[03:54:00]  commercials for uh for uh department stores walmart and whatnot jacked out but just let the kwanzaa  doesn't affect you there's no reason that that the black shouldn't be able to celebrate kwanzaa if  they like you're right why does that bug me because it's black people being happy and you don't  like that yeah you're right yeah i had a uh a black dental hygienist yesterday yeah yeah how old was  the assistant or dental assistant yeah she was a kind of big um woman older older not not as old as
