<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with typical crude sexual humor and boasting about their controversial reputation.  They discussed giving away a damaged snowboard with a suggestively wrapped "big package."  A planned snowboarding trip was mentioned, with Opie expressing his fear of skiing. The hosts then launched into a tirade about their negative experiences at SiriusXM,  calling the recent weeks "pretty fucking shitty."  A central complaint involved an invoice for World Series tickets arriving two months late, with the hosts focusing on the principle of the matter rather than the cost.  They further aired grievances about Anthony’s company cell phone, which SiriusXM claimed ownership of despite Anthony's purchase.  This ignited more angry outbursts about the company's policies and treatment of employees.

A large portion of the show was dedicated to furious rants against anonymous message board posters who criticized the hosts and questioned their loyalty. Opie used extremely offensive language to verbally attack these critics, focusing on comments about Jimmy's work ethic and Opie's appearance on another show.  The obsolescence of message boards in the age of social media was discussed.  The hosts then reviewed Jesse Ventura's conspiracy show, expressing mixed reactions, and criticized Linda Stassi's article on *Jersey Shore*.  The show concluded with a humorous but frustrating segment involving a wine gift from Dr. Steve, leading to comical confusion and a hasty call disconnection before identifying the wine's name. Opie ended by recounting his unsuccessful Call of Duty experience after drinking.

The show continued with loosely connected conversations.  The hosts and their friend, Derek, boasted about their online gaming skills, engaging in significant trash-talking ("noob," "piss boys," "douchebags"). Callers, including "Billie Jean" (with a message for Dr. Steve) and "John in Denver," contributed to a discussion about boxed wine. Opie mentioned upcoming stand-up gigs.  A brief discussion of the Boeing 787 Dreamliner occurred.  A leaked video of Louis C.K. and Nick DiPaolo in a heated argument was the focus of a segment; they connected Louis C.K. by phone, who explained it was a staged scene leaked by an extra.  Louis expressed frustration and anger, detailing the argument's content and plans for legal action.  The conversation was interspersed with humorous banter.  The show concluded with a discussion of Kiss's absence from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, digressions into Genesis, the Stooges, and Eric Clapton, a caller unexpectedly leaving the studio, and a nonsensical song about Tiger Woods' impending divorce and Elin Nordegren's demands.

A rambling discussion ensued about long, self-indulgent songs by artists like Joe Walsh and the Allman Brothers.  The hosts debated the merits of blues-influenced music, with strong opinions about George Thorogood and Stevie Ray Vaughan (with one host admitting to calling Stevie Ray Vaughan "Stevie Ray Badass" on air).  Listener calls with song requests and anecdotes, including a cab ride with excessively long musical interludes, filled the segment.  ABBA's rejected billion-dollar offer and listener opinions on various musicians were also discussed.  The focus shifted to the upcoming Opie and Anthony "Homeless Talent Show," highlighting logistical issues and anger at SiriusXM management over venue restrictions (only 24 audience members allowed, with restricted visibility).  The hosts vented extensively about the constraints placed on the event and the handling of the "Homeless Shopping Spree" promotion, interspersed with offensive jokes.  A brief discussion of Tiger Woods being named Athlete of the Decade followed, with callers sharing varying opinions.

The show further debated Tiger Woods' Athlete of the Decade title, using highly offensive language and making crude jokes about his extramarital affairs and the racial implications of golf.  Other potential candidates (Lance Armstrong, Roger Federer, Derek Jeter, Michael Phelps, and Tom Brady) were discussed with vulgar comments and rankings.  A false alarm involving the hosts' home security system and a perceived arrival of the Diaz brothers (caused by a security technician) interrupted the segment, with the hosts reacting with profanity and humorous descriptions.  The hosts later reviewed their past on-air blunders, playing clips and making fun of themselves.  They took calls, including one from Bobo announcing a kazoo and homeless choir performance for the next day.  The discussion included speculation about Tiger Woods' relationships and a description of Jimmy Norton’s experiences with NBC.  The segment concluded with the breaking news of Chris Henry’s death, followed by somber reflection and more off-color jokes.

A final segment consisted solely of the repeated word "Satin."


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  This is dangerous.  There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't tongue an asshole.  Psychotic, sexual, dude.  I just want to take it in the shitter like a good fruit. 
[00:00:30]  Really, it is a very, very bad thing.  Go fuck yourself.  It's unbelievable.  I love it.  We know we're great.  Everyone knows we're great.  Complete horseshit.  This show is never short of characters.  We're just gicks.  We don't get you one way.  We fuck you the other way.  This is like what goes on in a mental institution.  Coo-coo, coo-coo, coo-coo.  Hi, I'm the Opian Anthony Virus, and I'm here to infect you with hilarity.  But enough of this palaver. 
[00:01:00]  Let's get the show on the road.  How great is that?  Hey, morning.  Hi.  It's the Opian Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Hi, everybody.  How's everybody doing?  Good.  Good.  It's Thursday, isn't it?  It's Thursday.  That's good.  That's good.  And we got another love boards giveaway, I see, in the corner there.  Oh, we're getting the other one anyway.  Another burnt snowboard we're going to give away.  Yeah, come on.  Oh, it's got a package on there.  Huh?  It's got a big package wrapped around there.  Yeah, well.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's a very sweet snowboard.  A little carrying case or something.  Yeah, a little carrying case.  If you give them that away, that's...  They're not even that heavy. 
[00:02:00]  That's fantastic.  They can't be that heavy.  Jimmy, why don't we go snowboarding this...  I was ready to say this summer.  Why don't we go snowboarding this winter?  I actually would.  I've never done it.  I mean, I would like to try it.  It's pretty cool.  You'll be on your ass all afternoon, but...  That's right.  I'm afraid of skiing and stuff like that.  Why are you afraid?  Because it's scary.  Skiing rules.  And you break your legs and you can't do gigs.  You get hurt.  You're not going to break your legs.  You'll be on the bunny hill or something.  You'll be fine.  I love rabbits.  No.  Not that type of bunny hill. 
[00:02:30]  No.  I'm not saying I wouldn't try.  I've just not done it to date.  But, I mean, these things are apparently a lot of fun.  I mean, I would do it, though.  Yeah.  That would be fun.  I like it with the cover on it better.  Me too.  It makes a nice sound.  It's a very nice thing that we got to give away to our listeners today.  I am so...  Gay.  Yes.  Wow, you are Kreskin this morning.  You can't ever pause like that. 
[00:03:00]  What's wrong with you?  I learned that lesson months ago.  And I'm about to say something that you guys could squeeze word in.  I don't even leave space anymore between words.  Like, really?  I learned that a while ago.  For real, I learned that a while ago.  If you listen closely, you'll never hear me go, I'm so...  He's very funny.  I would be like, I'm so tired.  I'm so tired.  I'm so hungry.  I'm...  I'm really tired, yeah.  Yeah.  I really don't...  You can't fucking...  I'm so...  I'm so open to discussion. 
[00:03:30]  Go ahead, everybody.  You're so what?  Yeah.  Sick of this place?  No, no, no.  I'm just very...  I'm very irresponsible with my time.  No, wait, wait, wait.  You just fucking threw me under a bus.  I say I'm sick of this place just because it's the end of the year.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I know we've had our issues big time lately, but I'm sick of this place in general.  I just need to get away.  And I think that is a fair and safe thing to say.  Yeah, I think that gets... 
[00:04:00]  I think that's part of it, too.  Like, I'm just...  I'm really entering that mode of, like, I'm off.  I think, in general, we had a really good year here.  Yeah, we did.  I mean, the last week and a half has been pretty fucking shitty.  As far as doing shows and stuff.  Oh, the shows were fun.  Yeah, no, I'm not talking about outside this fucking room.  No, no, that's always a disaster.  Those guys have made the show a lot harder to do.  Even though they told us, you know,  that would have her.  God damn, not the same thing every day. 
[00:04:30]  The fun I have doing the show...  Sorry.  ...in this situation, this is what it reminds me of.  Fucking a hot girl in crushed glass.  There you go.  That's perfect.  Can I...  We're on this for a minute.  So I gotta say this.  And then, I didn't forget what you said about irresponsibility.  Just quick aside, but yeah.  No, what sums up this year...  I gotta say this.  Are we summing up the year?  I gotta say this.  It's amazing.  What sums up this year is what happened after the show yesterday as we're walking to the elevator. 
[00:05:00]  I saw something, and I saw an observation that I want to bring to everyone's attention.  Anthony and I are walking toward the elevator, just wanting to get out of here.  And all of a sudden, Rob Cross walks up to Anthony and hands him an envelope.  Oh, this sums up the year at SiriusXM.  I'm thinking Christmas bonus.  Christmas bonus?  Sure.  Christmas bonus.  I haven't seen one of those in years. 
[00:05:30]  Sure.  But, wow, it's Christmas bonus time.  But, boy, does this sum up our feelings about this place, and hopefully things will change in the new year.  So, Anthony opens it up and discovers that it's an invoice for the World Series tickets he asked SiriusXM for.  Yeah, it was my bill for the World Series tickets.  If that doesn't sum up the year here at SiriusXM...  Oh, yeah.  So, then...  So, Rob, I mean, I guess he's just a messenger, so I don't feel like beating him up any more than he is. 
[00:06:00]  He's got to fucking heal from all the bruises he got this week already.  So, I go to Anthony.  We're in the elevator.  I go, I've got to ask you, Ant.  Did you know you were getting a bill for the World Series tickets?  He looks at me, and then he goes, I'm finding out right now that I had to pay for my World Series tickets that I asked SiriusXM for.  You know, the company that has Major League Baseball.  Yeah.  That we promote pretty heavily on our channel. 
[00:06:30]  By the way, by the way, here's an example for you people listening on this contraption of what happens now when people misinterpret what this break is about.  Buy.  Buy, asshole.  What was the...  How did he interpret it?  How did somebody interpret it?  Cheap much?  It...  It's not about that.  Let me explain.  The point isn't the cost of the tickets, you fucking cunt.  It has nothing to do with it, you dumb, animal fucking cunt.  But...  God, it's not about that. 
[00:07:00]  It's the whole idea that...  First of all, I work here.  I'm using the experience of going to the game on the show.  Which you did.  I've discussed it a lot.  Which you did.  The series, the whole season, I was discussing the Yankees and then the playoffs and the series.  So, going to the games is a good thing to do so I could come in here and discuss what happened, what it was like to be in the new park for the first time that the Yankees are in the new park.  In the playoffs and the series. 
[00:07:30]  Just things like that.  And you're a fan.  And I'm a huge fan.  So it works out for everybody.  So I did...  It's not the amount of money.  I don't care about that.  Yes, I pay it.  I don't mind.  It's fine.  It's just that...  Why doesn't that guy or girl get the point that what we're trying to say here is the fact that Ant had no idea he had to pay for his World Series tickets until someone gave him an envelope a month and a half, two months after the fact.  Wow.  It's...  That's the point we're trying to make here. 
[00:08:00]  And trust me, they get a really good deal to begin with with the Opie and Anthony show.  Here's the deal.  A real good deal.  They have Major League Baseball.  They have MLB on the platform.  So you would think if a personality on the platform wants to go to the games and discuss it at length on the air, have some fun with it, you'd think they'd be like, wow, that's kind of a quid pro quo thing, you know? 
[00:08:30]  We get a little crossover action, the O&A show talking about sports and Major League Baseball, things like that.  And, well, what in the course of the year...  But more importantly is that if they were going to have you pay for the tickets, they should have told you outright.  Yeah, there was a...  I'll be honest.  There was a vague kind of you might have to, like you might have to pay.  But the whole thing is, it should just be like, well, you know. 
[00:09:00]  You do a good job for us.  You guys had a great year for us.  You brought in a lot of subscribers for us.  We understand we didn't really give you the deal you wanted.  And I don't think it's any, you know, sticking off their nose.  No, it's called taking care of your employees.  Yeah, that's all.  Just little things like that go a long way.  And for some reason, XM got that.  Sirius doesn't for some reason.  And I don't know why.  I asked for Ranger-Islander tickets yesterday because that's a huge hockey rivalry.  And last minute, I understand.  But I'm like, wow, they got this NHL thing. 
[00:09:30]  They got all...  Look, here I'm promoting it, by the way, as I talk about this.  They have all the games on SiriusXM.  You can flip around and listen to any hockey game on any given night.  So I'm like, wow, Islanders, Rangers, New York City.  I live five minutes away.  I want to go.  And the answer I got back was, well, the plan is if you start going on the NHL channels  and talk hockey because it seems like you're really into it, you know, that would be really  good.  And then that would eventually lead to you getting tickets. 
[00:10:00]  No, I needed tickets for that particular game.  I already have season tickets.  I get to go to 20 games easy this year.  Well, that's nice.  Maybe more because I go to away games when I can.  It's like, just take care of your fucking employees every once in a while.  I remember when we worked at rock stations.  If there was a concert coming around that you wanted to see, it wasn't even an issue.  You went.  Right.  You went to the PD or whatever and just said, oh, man, we got tickets for that show.  And he's like, yeah, here you go. 
[00:10:30]  And you get a couple of tickets.  You go see the show.  And that way you come back.  You talk about it.  You always make it part of your radio show.  Always.  Yeah, yeah.  Always.  But I'm with Ann in the elevator.  I'm like, after the week we had with these guys, they're giving you an invoice for your  work.  Yeah, that was a good.  But is it surprising?  That was a great time to give it to me.  Is it surprising?  Has anything happened in the last year which would indicate that anything was going to  happen but what happened there?  And I literally in 20 years of doing comedy, I've never dealt with this situation. 
[00:11:00]  I mean, I'm fucking speechless.  And I don't, it's whatever it is.  Here's the bottom line.  I had a great time at the games.  And you could afford to pay for it and all that.  And yes, I've been blessed with a career that affords me the ability to pay for said  tickets like that.  Sure.  So I'll just pay for it.  But it is one of those things where it's like you'd think, well, you'd think they'd take  care of that. 
[00:11:30]  No.  But this company's very...  They won't even give me my old cell phone back.  Peenie pinching.  Peenie pinching.  Did they ever get back to anybody about my old cell phone?  I don't know.  Supposedly they said that I signed...  Here's a corporate thing.  We talk about this stuff because I...  I gotta say, we talk about this because I think this is something everyone can relate  to out there.  The corporate world is a weird fucking place.  It's an alien world to me.  I got a BlackBerry that I'm on the corporate system and I wanted to upgrade my phone and 
[00:12:00]  I did just that with the brand new Bold in it.  And I'm loving it, by the way.  No trackball anymore.  This little optical thing is pretty...  Really?  It's pretty cool.  No trackball.  Well, I wish my iPhone didn't have a...  Oh, right.  I understand.  It's two different worlds.  Certainly.  I have an iPhone, too, and I use it a little bit.  I tinker with it.  But so they had to take my old phone and my new phone and take the old phone off the  system and put my new phone on the system. 
[00:12:30]  So you get corporate email and whatnot.  So I go, hey, can I have my old phone back?  Because see, my brother makes absolutely no money and he wants my cell phone to start  a business.  And quite frankly, I don't want to have to buy my brother a brand new cell phone if  I could just give him my old one, which is still a really good phone, by the way.  You just pass it.  Because I'm like Anthony.  I just get the...  I buy two phones a year because you just want the latest phone, right?  Mm-hmm.  They said to me, they wrote back and said that I signed over ownership of my cell phone in 
[00:13:00]  February, so I cannot have my own phone back.  Yeah.  Now, here's the thing.  I paid for these phones.  They could have bought me this new phone that I'm showing you guys right now.  I said, no, I'll buy my own phone.  I just want it on the corporate system so I can get the corporate email and stuff.  And I bought the old phone that they now supposedly own.  Mm-hmm.  I'm like, give me my old phone back.  They're like, sorry, we can't do that.  But you bought it.  I did buy it.  But for some weird corporate thing, I signed over ownership. 
[00:13:30]  The second thing...  I'm like, give me my old phone back.  My brother needs it.  You guys don't need my old phone.  The second they put any of their proprietary stuff on it, it becomes their property.  Is that it?  I guess.  It's actually, I swear to you, it is the same thing as if you drove in to a garage with  a flat tire.  They changed the tire.  Right.  And now they own the car.  Right.  Why the fuck?  How?  And it's always like, sorry, that's corporate policy. 
[00:14:00]  It's like, how about we go around corporate policy?  And how about you do the right thing and give me my old phone back?  Nine.  Please.  Nine?  Please.  I'm begging you.  Can I have my old phone back that I paid for?  Please?  So I could give it to my brother?  I unbounced that guy because when he said cheap, he meant the company.  Oh, you fucked him.  So, um.  All right.  Sorry, you handled it well.  Get out, you animal fucking cunt. 
[00:14:30]  At least you put the right amount of emphasis to his two remarks.  Well, we're a bit on edge.  We just need to get it.  We need to just put this year behind us and hope for better things in 2010.  I was yelling at a fan mere minutes into the program.  And by the way, I don't even like to talk about the message boards anymore because most  of them are fine.  Yeah.  But just, I understand that they speculate and a lot of times they're wrong.  But to the scumbag, um, I don't mind when they speculate, but it's like when they  actually come up with their points of authority, they want, like, do they have X amount 
[00:15:00]  of posts and they want to act like they've been around the block, you know, and this  fucking one douchebag, uh, you know, if Jimmy's going to leave in, uh, October, he's probably  just going to mail it in.  Listen to me, you fucking jizz bucket, uh, animal fucking cunt.  Not even.  I like.  How would you know that he said that?  Because I looked at it.  I shouldn't have.  Believe me, I should have.  I'll go back to those places when I feel like they're fancy.  Never again.  It's a thing of the past with Twitter. 
[00:15:30]  But I'm just saying.  And I still use this and that.  I'm just saying.  No need.  I don't mind fan sites if they, if I go there and I go, wow, this is obviously a fan site.  I don't feel that anymore.  There's no need to go to a message board with Twitter and fucking your Facebooks and shit  like that.  And, and, and PT over here on PT, things like that make message boards and they're obsolete.  There's no reason to fucking go there.  But the point is, I know.  No, no, no, no.  Go ahead.  I just, to say that I would mail it.  It's like, you're just, if you're not a fan of mine, that's, you know, please, you've got 
[00:16:00]  the right to be there.  First of all, he's mailing it in before then.  Dude, I've been doing that since fucking 1990, the first time I walked on.  And then this scumbag, this fucking scumbag, uh, questions my loyalty to the show because  I went on the fucking miserable men show and they didn't mention Opie and Anthony.  Nobody before I went on miserable men said, don't mention Opie and Anthony.  I'm telling you, nobody said that.  Nobody said you can't.  Nobody goes, Jim, just don't.  Nobody.  So don't fucking question my loyalty, you piece of shit. 
[00:16:30]  Fucking you anonymous scumbag message board.  Fucking poster.  Speculating.  Just question my loyalty to the show.  What are you fucking nuts?  You only knew.  Unbelievable.  Jimmy's pretty much working for free right now.  Speculate if a gun's loaded in your mouth.  But if you understood the amount of shows that we have fought with that I have not gone  on on the road to promote gigs, and I'm fine not doing it.  Believe me.  I don't mind not going on the show.  You don't have to explain.  But I am explaining because other people read that.  So it's like, that's, that's what it is.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[00:17:00]  That's, again, of course you've got a fake fucking message board name, but whatever you  are, don't like me, that's acceptable.  You don't like my performance, that's also acceptable.  But don't start coming off like you're a point of the thought, you're not.  He knows.  You don't.  Oh, he knows, doesn't he?  That was the only thing that annoyed me.  How infuriating.  Just a, just a fucking jerk off.  That's why.  Who probably stands at the message board parties and would walk up and go, hey man, I really  like your stuff.  Or wouldn't, at least if I was sitting there, go, look, man, how come you aren't loyal to  the show?  Would never.  No.  No.  Walk up and just say that.  There are people I know from the message boards who I know douched us a long time ago, 
[00:17:30]  and I see them in real life now, I will not acknowledge they're alive.  So a couple of you that might think I was really rude, I know your old message board  names.  That's why I'm fucking rude to you.  That's why you were a cop.  I know your message board name.  I'm not mean to you, like, I just won't speak.  There's no need for it.  It's weird.  Yep.  Good.  It's weird to have a fan site that tries to tear the show up.  But most of them are fine.  Honestly, most of them are great.  They really are.  Most of them have fun with it.  They try to tear the show down.  And you say you're a fan site. 
[00:18:00]  Go away.  Most of them are fine.  And even the ones that don't like me are still fine because they're fans.  I'm only talking about that kind of criticism.  There's enough things you could do with Twitter.  You post, you know, bam, there's a picture.  Boom, there's a picture up there.  You know what, dude?  If I want to talk to fans, boom, I send out a message.  They go, hey, Bobo, boom, you know, you're Robert Kelly live.  Bob, come to the show, dude.  Send out a picture.  Dude.  Go fishing, dude.  You ever notice how fast something leaves my life?  Boom, dude. 
[00:18:30]  The vacuum, nothing can fill the hole.  I can't fish.  We're going fishing again in the spring.  And you're coming with us, Jimmy.  Not happening.  Match the hatch.  You're doing some fly fishing with us.  Not happening.  Yeah, you will.  Never.  Yeah, you will.  Never.  By the way, the Islanders did beat the Rangers.  Rangers.  Did you go?  I heard that on the way.  And I will not be appearing on any NHL fucking channel anytime soon.  Because that's not how I work.  I like it to be organic and just fucking natural.  Loyalty to the show. 
[00:19:00]  You know what?  If they didn't mention the art, good loyalty to the show.  Oh, shut up, you fucking faggot.  Shut up.  Oh, nice to see you.  What do you do?  Do you fucking, do you suck somebody else's dick to your post count?  How many do you have?  Look at that comma.  Oh, my God.  You have more than more.  And this guy doesn't even have that many. 
[00:19:30]  He probably wants to get it up, you know.  A couple of the douche bags count up.  Oh, my God.  Oh, the girls must love that.  Let's suck his cock.  He's got more posts than most people.  Oh, that guy talks on the message board more than most people.  How many do you have?  I've got this.  You've got a comma in your...  A comma in the post.  Shut up.  Fucking asshole.  And then someone tries to say something nice to their new poster and everyone just jumps on him. 
[00:20:00]  It's like, yeah, that's smart.  That's how you're going to get the numbers up on your site.  Just beat the shit out of anybody that tries to contribute.  There have been plenty of people that have fine, fine.  The majority, I understand that.  But they've got to take back the fucking spirit of the board, then.  I have not been to a fucking Opie and Anthony message board of any kind in probably well over a year.  I don't even know when the last time I even checked in, never mind posted anything or commented on anything. 
[00:20:30]  I see no reason for it.  Because most of the time it was because I wanted to post a picture or, you know, say something or...  Well, since...  Well, that's what you do on message boards.  That's good.  I wanted to either post a picture or say something.  What else would you do?  Yeah.  Well, Anthony...  I'm an idiot.  Yes, you certainly are.  Anthony, since I discovered...  I didn't mean to be disloyal by saying you're an idiot.  Oh, well, you are.  I read it.  Since I discovered Twitter and presented it to the world...  Oh, absolutely.  I've been way down as far as going there as well.  Yeah, you're right. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  There's no reason.  Follow us on Twitter.  Opie Radio, Jim Norton, Anthony Cumia, right?  Nein.  Right?  That's all it is?  Yeah, it's...  Anthony Cumia.  Yeah, Anthony Cumia.  Jim Norton on Twitter?  Yeah.  And Opie Radio.  We've got a nice little fucking network of people that are really enjoying what we're  doing.  And it's very appreciated.  The replies I get, I've got to tell you, very appreciated.  I can't get back to everybody, but I certainly try. 
[00:21:30]  And I thank you.  And if you get shit, boof.  You can just block people.  It's easy.  It's like, I don't even need to...  I don't need this in my life.  If I think it's undue criticism, I will.  I've had people say shit that I use.  You know, whatever.  Oh, no, there's a difference.  Yeah.  I could handle criticism.  It's the people that are not fans that are just following you to be assholes.  I was tweeting last night during the wonderful Jesse the Body Ventura show on the global  warming.  Yeah, how was that?  And, oh, Opie, fascinating.  Fascinating what this man does. 
[00:22:00]  What's his take on that?  Don't even ask me.  You don't know?  I didn't serve.  I didn't serve.  How could I possibly convey what that masterful, genius Jesse the Body Ventura knows?  Did he fly into the middle of a hurricane or something?  Or did he try to make it rain?  What did he do?  He sent their people to China.  China?  To try to find a guy that knows something about global warming.  He's the one making all the money.  I guess Jesse...  That was my one post.  Here's my one post.  It said, can we all keep in mind this is the man exposing our government? 
[00:22:30]  Oh, you went old school, Jesse.  It's a picture of the old school Jesse and his boa and his sunglasses.  That's ludicrous now that he's the authority.  I've got to stick up for Jesse now.  All righty.  You're very smart.  I try.  And you're talking politics better than most of the talking heads on TV.  I try.  It would take me 10 seconds to find a picture of you looking like a complete mad man.  I am not... 
[00:23:00]  From 10, 12 years ago.  I was not a governor.  And I'm not trying to dispel these fucking...  Exactly.  I'm not a...  But you're a talk show host now.  Look how adorable I was.  You're a talk show host now.  And that comes with respect.  And I got pictures of you looking...  Respect!  Looking like you...  I don't know.  That they haven't discovered what species you are yet.  Oh, I know.  It's fantastic.  But you know something?  I'm not on TV talking to government officials about conspiracies. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah.  Well, give me the lowdown.  So he went to China.  Try to find people.  Why does my name come up?  And then docking.  I saw a couple docking.  That wasn't me, I swear.  Is there something you want to tell us, Mr. Komiya?  Docking.  Are you into docking?  Are you secretly into docking?  A lot of Jill pictures pop up, too.  Um, uh, no, Jesse's, uh, Jesse's, uh, show was just amazing.  And, and interestingly enough, Opie, interestingly enough, he took the opposite angle on this. 
[00:24:00]  He says the global warming controversy is all based on people getting rich off of something  that hasn't been proven.  He's not one of these guys saying that there is global warming.  See, I thought he was going to go that way.  Boom!  He goes the other way on me.  Wait, you thought he was going to say there's...  There is global warming.  Global warming.  But since, I guess, you know, a lot of people believe in global warming, he went the other  way and chatted with, again, bad actors that are supposed, uh, scientists and witnesses 
[00:24:30]  to things.  Secret people.  There's one man that lives out somewhere.  I don't know.  They had to take a ferry there.  They wouldn't say where it was.  A lot of fog.  And then they had a screen.  Well, if you could do a conspiracy show, you got a film in fog.  Yes, very foggy.  I'm not surprised by that.  They had the screen with the light behind him, the light behind him, so you couldn't  see him, but you could see his silhouette.  And everyone said, oh my God, that looks like Jesse Ventura, uh, with his voice change 
[00:25:00]  on his screen.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You think it was?  I don't think it was, but it was funny that everyone thought it was.  That's classic.  And, um, again, he proved nothing.  Not one of the best, uh, episodes I've seen.  It's one of the, it was kind of like, not, not gonna, but he kept going, follow the money.  He kept telling his crew there in the war room, here's what you do, people.  Follow the money.  Every time. 
[00:25:30]  Next, Jesse goes into danger alone.  Uh-oh.  Oh, yeah, and they show him walking, like, slow motion into the light.  And then he's in China, they're in China, uh, chasing down this guy that's apparently  the mastermind of this scheme to destroy the world economy using global warming as a fear  thing, and, and they're chasing him, they're chasing him down the street in China.  I, I, it was ridiculous.  I don't, I, I'm, I still don't know what he did last night. 
[00:26:00]  I don't know what he did either, I swear to you.  He's so good at explaining stuff, I'm lost.  He just looks at the camera and goes, uh-huh, do I have to say any more?  We gotta get clips.  He's an idiot.  I know we told Sam no clips today on that one, but we gotta get clips.  He's an idiot.  Was he, did he bring earthquake with him?  Uh, no.  Earthquake should know something about global warming.  No, you would think, you would think earthquake might know something, but, um, no.  Gorilla Monsoon?  Monsoon.  Gorilla Monsoon.  Monsoon had to be there, no? 
[00:26:30]  Think about it.  Oh, he's dead.  I know.  Ah, see, they shut him up.  I know, but for the, for the purpose of this bit, we make believe all the wrestlers are  alive.  Because it's like, this makes it so much more fun.  It's like the wrestling halls of justice where, uh, you know, they, they're still alive.  Right.  Still alive.  Speaking of wrestlers, um, Sam tweeted last night, and this, he, he always tweets wrestling,  which I can't be bothered with for the most part.  Of course.  And I like Sam a lot.  That's why I don't follow him anymore.  But, um, uh, the WWE signed Bret Hart. 
[00:27:00]  And we had Bret Hart on our show about a year and a half ago.  Yes, we did.  I would guess it was about a year and a half ago when he had a book.  Yeah.  He doesn't look like he should be wrestling unless something has drastically changed in the  last year or so.  No.  But they signed him, uh, uh, to appear on the WWE.  Wow.  For the next, uh, couple months at least.  How's that all about?  Four months or something like that.  I don't know.  I don't know how that's going to work out.  Look, keep up your good nature.  But anyway, back to, so, so Jesse, did he, did he deal with like Al Gore or any of that 
[00:27:30]  shit?  Uh, yeah, they said Al, he, he, he broke into an interview between, uh, one of his staff and,  uh, a gentleman that supposedly ran a business.  I don't know who he was, what he did.  I don't know this man.  I don't know what he does.  But Jesse comes in and the guy's like, Oh, surprise.  Like, cause he's talking with the woman that's set up like a regular interview on TV.  And then Jesse comes in and sits down.  He goes, how are you doing?  Like just to sit down now.  And he took the guy by surprise. 
[00:28:00]  The guy's like, Oh, Jesse.  Oh, and now Jesse starts questioning him and he, he just kept going like, no comment, no  comment.  Like a CEO or an owner or whatever he is of this company would actually say that on camera.  So he'd elaborate.  And maybe if he didn't want to answer the question, go like, Jesse, look, here's what it is.  I'm not going to, you don't sit there and look guilty by going no comment.  He's an actor.  You think so?  Yeah.  So you think the whole show is fake? 
[00:28:30]  Fake.  Not the whole show.  There are some people he talks to, but the people he talked to, he talks to, they don't  amount to a hill of beans.  That's a reenactment.  We're allowed to reenact.  We can do that.  Can I tell you, it's, it's a shame because I think, I think all of us love a good conspiracy,  especially when we were growing up.  The whole JFK thing is the biggie, but, but UFOs and big fans.  For, just think of in search of, if you're a little older, imagine if you update that  type of show, there's so much, there's so many new conspiracies and they're blowing it 
[00:29:00]  by having Jesse do it.  I'm thinking, uh, in the, when someone brought up a great point in the, in the war room when  they're, they're looking off, they're just looking at Jesse and Jesse's like, follow  the money.  That's how we'll find out where this trail ends.  And everyone's like looking at Jesse, like, yeah, yeah, we got to do it.  And they kind of panned around the table.  One guy had IMs open on his computer.  So he's just, he's just talking to his pals.  I'm sure.  Yeah.  He's not doing anything on this computer. 
[00:29:30]  Oh God.  It was so bad.  And, uh, it wasn't even like one of the best, uh, episodes next week.  Uh, what does he do next week?  Oh, it's, I remember seeing the, uh, spot for it and I was, I was thrilled.  Yeah, but it's going to be something really good.  But we were thrilled about, uh, global warming.  It looks like it was a bust.  It was a bust.  Yeah.  Cause Jesse solved absolutely nothing again.  And I don't know what you just explained.  Exactly.  I don't know when I watched it.  He went to China.  To track down this guy.  Did he talk about the tsunami?  No.  Oh, that was the weather machine. 
[00:30:00]  Right.  That was the mind control harp thing that caused that.  Right.  Right.  This was all about, he doesn't believe in, uh, uh, global warming.  He thinks it's a giant conspiracy to make money.  So did he explain Hurricane Katrina then?  Uh, say it wasn't global warming making these hurricanes a little more deadly.  This was only him chasing down people that are making boatloads of money on making people  think there's global warming.  So there's this one guy.  I kind of like that.  Who's going after those guys?  Well, only because.  Profiteering on global warming. 
[00:30:30]  That's what he said.  Profiteering.  He goes.  That's a good word, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And he brought up, you know, it's like a war on global warming.  And when war comes, you got profiteering.  That's it.  No matter what.  I was a Navy SEAL.  But no matter what, you'll always have profiteering.  Of course.  Uh, next week.  Oh my God.  Big Brother is watching.  And it's not what you think.  Jesse Ventura's investigation of government surveillance on citizens tears the lid off of nationwide  program that is, uh, thought to turn local businessmen and office workers into spies snooping 
[00:31:00]  on their neighbors and ratting on their friends in exchange for information and special privileges  from the FBI, including some charge a license to kill.  Nobody charges that.  Nobody.  And again, he's really smart.  He covers his bases.  We're not watching our neighbors.  Dan, what's he say here?  He goes, that some say.  Some say.  The little things that it could be that I've heard, none of this is fact.  It's fucking, and I understand it's a fun show. 
[00:31:30]  It doesn't, you know, it doesn't have to be, uh, you know.  But we're not watching our neighbors in general.  No.  If there's some kind of suspicious thing, you might kind of, I kind of, kind of watch  them closely to make sure, like, there's nothing going on.  But in general, we don't, we're too busy to watch our neighbors.  We're not ratting people out.  Unless, unless they're, you know, getting changed in front of an open window or something.  Well, of course.  Then, of course, you've got to watch.  Tear the lid off a nationwide program that is thought.  Thought.  To turn local businessmen and ratting out their feet, their friends in exchange for information 
[00:32:00]  and some charge.  Some charge a license to kill.  Thought and some charge.  Yeah, yeah.  In that shows you the fucking lack of conviction.  It's all.  Exactly.  I've gotten, the hate emails I got from some of his Jesse people who are like 9-11 truthers.  Man.  I know.  Yeah.  The, what childlike dumb motherfuckers.  They just don't understand.  They will never really look at things.  They, they just regurgitate what they hear.  Yeah, he should have hit you.  Fuck you. 
[00:32:30]  And fuck your anger in your emails.  It doesn't bother me.  Oh, that, that, that was the point.  The one I was, I was making right before this was, uh, that, uh, um, like banning people  from your, well, blocking people on your Twitter.  Sure.  I was Twittering this and some guy went like, you know, uh, wow, a real tough guy on your  Twitter or something like that.  He was talking about how Jimmy stood up to him and why didn't I say anything when he  was there.  And that was me.  And yeah, I know.  That's why I didn't block you.  But like, I wouldn't block that.  I don't care.  Oh my God. 
[00:33:00]  Can I, it's like, can I, whatever.  You're an idiot.  Let me explain that one.  You don't think I wanted in on the Jesse Ventura fight, but when you, when like you,  one of your buddies is in a fight, you'll let them fight.  You know what I mean?  You have gold going on.  You're not, you don't jump in.  Of course.  I want it in and want it in.  Jimmy was handling himself just fine.  Perfect.  And we were kind of sitting back just waiting to see what our move would be if it got uglier.  Yeah, that's it.  I told that I've been boxing lately and I would have boxed him and just laughed at me.  As you should have seen.  I don't care how crazy he is. 
[00:33:30]  That meat fish that his will fucking put a hole in your face.  The last thing I wanted.  I just love how you laughed at me.  I'm like, you know, I've been boxing a little bit in the gym lately.  I think I could have hit him a couple of times if I had to.  Just being a dope.  Yeah.  So an ex-wrestling is a strong guy.  Like if he just grabs you and throws you against the wall, you're in trouble, man.  A guy like that.  I was a governor.  I was a fighter.  No, you, you, you fake wrestled. 
[00:34:00]  You're a, you were a fake wrestler.  A Navy SEAL.  All right.  Frog man.  All right.  Well, we'll hopefully we'll get a couple of clips.  If they can find a couple of fun ones, that'd be good.  The phones, a lot, a lot of stuff going on.  Dennis, stay there.  I'm going to go to you next, but I want to go to Tommy, Michigan first.  Tommy, what's up?  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy D.  No, I'm jealous of Ron and Fez because every time they have a Tommy phone call, they play 
[00:34:30]  Tommy from The Who.  Yeah.  I'm like, God damn it.  That's so good.  I wish we came up with that.  We did.  Did we?  Well, no, no disrespect, but I remember when.  So can we.  Well, with with we did it with Dice.  Come on.  When Dice went Tommy and it was like, Tommy, can you hear?  And we had Dice doing it.  Holy shit.  It was.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Get me some Tommy.  Tommy.  Tommy.  Are you saying Ron and Fez ripped us off? 
[00:35:00]  It was Tommy.  You could say it.  Can you hear?  No.  They could handle the truth.  No, it's.  It's like Jesse Ventura, you know, dishing out the truth.  They could handle the truth.  It could be looked at differently because it was Dice and Dice was like on the phone or  was he here?  I'm not sure.  But it was somebody on the phone, I think, named Tommy.  And we kept playing the Tommy.  Can you hear me thing?  And it was like.  So it was.  It was ours to begin with.  How about we play nice, though?  Is there another name that we could like jump on and then have a little clip every time  that name calls? 
[00:35:30]  What other name songs are there?  Well, we got Hello Bill.  No, no.  I want it in a rock song.  Oh, you want a rock song?  I don't know.  How about if.  How about we have a lot.  How about if someone named Billie Jean calls up?  All right.  All right.  Billie Jean.  Travis, could you get the Billie Jean clip?  I have a feeling we get a lot of Billie Jean calls.  No, we won't.  And I want some bests to call, too.  All right.  That's a good one.  Because of Kiss being snubbed by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  We'll get us that in a second, Jimmy.  I know.  Tommy, go ahead.  Tommy.  Tommy. 
[00:36:00]  Fellas, what's up?  Hey.  Hey, how are you?  I'm calling from Michigan.  The Jersey Boys, that group, not very bright.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  I am.  And I want some bests.  Tommy, what are you trying to do?  Oh, my God.  Tommy, for real.  What are you trying to do?  That show, man, those guys aren't that bright.  Okay.  Now, how do you know this?  Do you watch the show?  Oh, they were on the D. Leno show last night.  Oh, okay.  All right.  God damn, are you stupid. 
[00:36:30]  So, two minutes into the phone call, we finally know why you're calling.  That's good.  Yeah.  Okay.  So, you saw him on Leno.  So, how was it?  Please enlighten those people that did not see it and make the experience as if we had seen it.  Go ahead.  Well, obviously, they come on at 10 o'clock in Michigan, but they were asking questions about the U.N. and everything else, and they just did not know the answer whatsoever.  They would pass it up to the next person.  Well, I'll let you take this one.  I'll let you take this one.  Well, we really didn't need you to begin with, Tommy. 
[00:37:00]  But thank you.  You calling to say someone stupid is stupid.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  We're just going to let you go.  All right.  I want to know about that controversy, and I want Jimmy's take on it.  Yeah, that's why I said hold on to Dennis.  Yeah.  What controversy?  Because I know you heard about it.  You had heard about this.  I don't know.  I heard from one of Dr. Steve's tweets.  Well, hold on.  Was that wine?  That wine was from Dr. Steve.  And I didn't wine.com that motherfucker yet.  I drank some last night. 
[00:37:30]  Let's wine.com that motherfucker.  Good bottle.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  How do you know?  Did you wine.com it?  No, I drank it, and it tastes good.  What's the name of it?  Yeah, but...  That's all I care about.  You're not a true wine connoisseur.  I've been drinking wine since I was fucking 10.  Your taste buds are all fucked up from the Guinness.  Is that it?  Yes.  And the shots.  It was a fine glass of wine.  Shots, shots, shots.  Wonderful.  What was the name of the wine that Dr. Steve gave us?  Swill?  Yes.  C-U-M.  Wake that motherfucker up and say, 
[00:38:00]  what wine did you send Opie and Anthony for Christmas?  I don't care if he needs a good night's sleep.  It wasn't one of his own creation.  He had actually bought this.  I know.  We're wine.com-ing his ass.  And did you get the chocolate and everything?  That was terrific.  Dr. Steve is a great guy.  Boo.  He's a cuckold.  What chocolate?  He's a cuckold.  It's like these boxes of various chocolates that stack up like a little pyramid with a bow tied around it.  And you open the top of it and it's a little box.  I wouldn't know.  It's not a pyramid. 
[00:38:30]  What is it?  It's supposed to be a Christmas tree.  It's a holiday fucking box stack.  I thought it was a pyramid.  It's supposed to look like a tree.  You really are a fucking...  You are a ghoul, Anthony.  Do not recognize it's a holiday tree.  Jesus, what's wrong with you?  I don't know.  It was a tree.  The boxes get smaller as they go up.  That could be a pyramid.  And the deliciousness gets better as the boxes get smaller.  Really?  Because I started with a smaller one.  Just like in real life.  Oh, yes.  The small boxes are always tastier.  He did send me something, though. 
[00:39:00]  Dr. Steve is a great guy.  Dr. Steve is like...  Oh, stop kissing his ass.  He's very generous.  He's lucky that we're friends.  He's nice, and he's funny as hell.  I like Dr. Steve.  Is he?  Yeah, he's not annoying in the least.  I find him to be a bag of shit with ears.  I second that.  What did you want to ask me about?  Hold on.  Whatever it is, I'll have the answer.  Follow the money.  Hold on.  Follow the money.  I'll tell you what company it doesn't lead to.  Follow the money out of my pocket into the Major League Baseball. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Follow the money.  I think I lost money this year working for this company.  For real.  It's a text writer.  It started one way and ended another way by the end of the year.  What happened?  That's normal.  No, before we move on to that, Jimmy, the situation was on Leno.  Sam's got a couple good clips.  But besides that, our favorite writer, Linda Stassi, is all over this Jersey Shore.  And she talked to the programmer at MTV. 
[00:40:00]  Tony DeSanto.  Yeah.  Tony DeSanto.  And the article in the paper is just terrific.  I read it.  Oh, is it?  What do you think?  What's your take on the Linda Stassi going after Tony article?  Well, because, you know, I find her repulsive.  I think she's a fucking, an out-of-touch cornball.  She's a stupid soccer mom mentality.  Yes.  Her idea of writing funny is, you know, make sure you don't have any Diet Coke that you  can squirt through your nose, like, for a comedy show.  Oh, good God.  The woman sucks.  And so she thinks that she'll shame Tony DeSanto personally by going after him for jerseys. 
[00:40:30]  Because she's an Italian-American.  And he blew her off the first time, as he should have.  Yeah.  Because she's a fucking, she's shit.  Right.  And then he did talk to her, and he gave her the right answers.  And she's still just being a twat.  That's what she is.  It's like, Tony, I understand why he talked to her.  Mm-hmm.  But, first of all, why are they not showing the Snooki punch?  All right, yeah, it's not a nice moment, but they show guys punching each other all the  time.  It was in a bar.  They're not glorifying a husband punching a wife. 
[00:41:00]  So, stop.  You're going to put a laugh track behind it like we did.  Exactly.  They should have not have yanked that clip.  Yeah.  But, uh, I like Tony a lot, and I fucking hate her.  I have no respect for her as a journalist, and I don't give a fuck about her opinion.  She's an old lady.  Fuck off.  I'm confused by the rest of the media, where they're outraged, quote, outraged by the punch,  as they show the punch on their show.  Exactly.  What's the difference?  Isn't that a bad thing, to show the punch no matter what, no matter what you say after  you see the clip?  They're despicable.  And, by the way, where was her big article?  Or Mushnick on the fact that the New York Post hired Ashley Dupree to write an advice 
[00:41:30]  column.  So, this prostitute...  Yeah, why doesn't Linda Stassi go after fucking Dupree?  The New York Post.  I mean, why wouldn't you go after the parent company?  Because what they did, you may say, is very immoral, by hiring a girl who fucked a married  governor for money.  There you go.  Where's your outrage?  You want to talk about that.  What's more damaging?  Some fucking mook throwing a punch at a girl.  Everybody knows he's drunk.  Everybody knows it's in a bar. 
[00:42:00]  Or...  No one's looking at the guy in that clip and going, yeah.  He's great.  Yeah.  Or legitimizing a young prostitute and saying, hey, look where this can lead you.  If you fuck enough high-profile people, a legitimate newspaper will hire you and seek  out your counsel.  Exactly.  So, what's more damaging to women, you fucking phony soccer mom?  Right about that.  Right about that, you fucking phony soccer mom, you fucking easy target shooting at old  lady.  She stinks.  As your paper has more stuff on Tiger, you know.  Exactly.  All you do...  And again, I read the post every day. 
[00:42:30]  I'm not going to lie to you.  I like the post, but I know what the post is.  Good for you.  I mean, I understand what it is.  I don't...  I know what it is.  They cover the shit I want covered.  Except for racial stuff.  Yeah.  She sucks.  And she...  And Tony was very honest.  Of course he was.  He was extremely honest.  And said, look, he's not trying to do anything with this show.  Really isn't.  Yeah.  Where's her...  He founded a good concept, and he's going with it.  Yeah.  Dr. Steve is on the line.  Steve, we wake you up.  Dr. Steve. 
[00:43:00]  No, actually...  All right, we're going to wine.com, you're asked.  What was the name of that wine?  Oh, my goodness.  Well, here's the problem.  I've worked with a guy from winesbuy.com every year when I get you guys your wine, and I  told him, I said, these assholes only think that wine that costs $100 from you, which means  it costs $400 in the restaurant.  Exactly.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  I've got to stop you.  Dr. Steve...  It really is just me.  Anthony is very appreciative.  I'm taking a little offense to the you assholes, because I appreciate your gifts, and I also 
[00:43:30]  appreciate a good glass of wine, which I had last night out of that bottle.  With the chocolate?  It was fantastic.  A little wine, a little chocolate?  Dude, exactly.  That's a good combo.  Exactly.  It was fantastic.  Thank you so much.  Yeah, Steve.  Steve, we are individuals, and I'm wine.com in your ass, not Anthony.  Yeah.  Now, give me the name of that fucking wine you sent me as a Christmas gift.  Wait, didn't you send me a book, too, Steve?  Thank you.  I did. 
[00:44:00]  See, Jimmy, I know you don't drink, and then you're trying to watch your weight, so I didn't  send you any chocolate.  Thank you very much.  See, thoughtful gift.  Yes, Dr. Steve is great.  Yes.  All right, what is it, Steve?  And I texted him a picture of my cock and asshole.  See, thoughtful gifts back.  Steve.  Yeah, then you called me a bag of shit with ears this morning.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I didn't mean that.  I meant that you also have hair and a thought process.  You're a sweet man.  Oh, that sucks.  I thought he meant it.  All right, give me the name of the wine.  Well, that's what I'm trying to find. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, because I didn't look myself.  I just threw it in my fucking wine area.  It's spelled W-Y-N-E.  It's not good.  You don't even know what you sent me?  Sorry?  You don't even know what you sent me?  Well, you know, that's what I was going to say.  So I told him to get at least a $100 bottle of wine, but he found something else that cost  much, much less, but it was much higher rated.  So I'm looking for what it was.  It starts with an F, I believe. 
[00:45:00]  I'm looking for what it was that he, uh, uh, shit.  Oh, here it is.  Okay.  Oh, got it.  Spell it.  It was Peter Francis, no, Franus, Napa Cab 2005.  Yeah, that was it.  Cab 2005.  How do you spell that last name?  Peter what?  I think it's F-R-A-N-U-S.  It's got anus in it.  Franus.  Franus.  Oh, great.  That's not a subliminal message.  Boy, there you go.  Thanks.  It's just Peter for anus.  He's calling you an asshole because you look at wine.com. 
[00:45:30]  For all, everything I did for you, you're sending me an ass wine.  That's great.  Thank you.  All right.  What do we, what do we got?  Knowing that I had that prostate issue earlier this year that turned out completely fine,  but I don't want to be reminded of a doctor sticking fingers up my ass.  Oh, is that?  You found it already?  It really was a coinkydink, but it was.  Oh, that's different.  There you go.  All right.  Pop up wine.com.  Here we go.  He can't even find it on wine.com, doctor.  See, it's that good. 
[00:46:00]  Maybe he spelled it wrong, this guy that said it to him.  Maybe it's Peter Francis.  I don't know.  Oh, great.  He spelled it F-R-A-N-U-S.  You're right.  Napa Cab.  No, we found it on Google, but they just don't feel like selling it on wine.com.  You know, the biggest distributor of online wine.  Oh, I'm sure it's there.  It was rated 93 points out of 100.  Oh, wow.  Wow, that's great.  No, it's not Peter Frampton wine.  People are starting to come up. 
[00:46:30]  Night Train.  Oh, it's Peter Frampton.  Strawberry Hill.  Strawberry Hill.  Boone's Farm.  Was that the F-Boone's Farm?  No.  Ah, there it is.  I appreciate the twist off, though.  That's it.  It made it so much easier to get to the wine.  Look at that wine.  All right, here we go.  Really good wine.  Here it is.  Drum roll, please.  We found it.  Drum roll, please.  Peter Frampton.  That looks like it.  That's the bottle.  It is $42.95 on Wine.com. 
[00:47:00]  That's a good bottle of wine.  What?  Did you hang up on Dr. Steve?  Holy shit!  You are an asshole!  Oh, no!  Oh!  Didn't make the cut.  Dr. Steve is a saint!  Didn't make the cut.  He's saintly!  At least he didn't send you that fucking swill he gives his friends every year.  You are Peter Anus. 
[00:47:30]  Good news to the staff.  They're going to have a fine bottle of wine tomorrow.  Oh, shit!  Fifty bucks and above.  Everyone knows that by now.  I had it, and it was amazing.  Fifty bucks or above.  Do you know what that would cost in a liquor store?  That would cost upwards of $100, probably in the $80 to $90 range.  Yeah.  By the way, I do know how Dr. Steve makes his own wine.  Yeah.  It's throughout the year.  What he'll do is he squats over a bucket, and he wrings out his ass hair into a bucket. 
[00:48:00]  Oh, bless you.  Bless you, sweetie.  Oh, my God.  You must be allergic to good radio.  That's so horrible.  Wrings out his ass hair.  That's why each bottle is made with care and a lot of labor.  You, man, hanging up on him was just uncalled for.  Perfect.  And I sit here every year hoping for Christmas gifts, and I wonder why I have one, maybe two 
[00:48:30]  brave souls give me something at this point.  That was, I had it last night.  It was good.  Very good.  That was part of my irresponsibility that I was talking about last night.  What, drinking a bottle of wine alone on a Wednesday gets healthy?  I didn't drink the whole bottle.  But, yeah, I slept very late again, which I always do now, especially right before vacay  because I'm gearing up for my time change like a party. 
[00:49:00]  Party.  And so I'm drinking a little wine, and I figure I'm going on to play some Call of Duty.  So I go on there, and it's about 11 o'clock when I decide I'm going to start playing Call  of Duty, which is never a good idea.  So I pop on.  Like, of course, Keith was the last one that was signed in to my console.  So I go to sign in, and I have no connection, no wireless connection to my Xbox.  I don't know what happened to it, but I didn't know. 
[00:49:30]  I wasn't even hardwired in.  Do you know I've been playing that game wireless instead of hardwired in?  So that's how you're going to try to spin this, as your excuse for sucking a big dick?  I, you know something?  No.  I will still suck a big dick at the game.  But there is a noticeable difference, Danny.  A noticeable difference in, when I was standing there shooting at somebody, no, I'm hitting  at them, and they're shooting at the same time, I would always get killed.  Now?  No.  Doesn't happen that way.  And I got the fucking heartbeat sensor on the rifle now. 
[00:50:00]  Let me tell you that thing.  It is killer.  Derek's calling you a noob in the other room.  Fuck your ass, D-boy.  I heard that through walls.  It is...  I heard noob through walls.  It is great.  Yeah.  I was getting kills like I'd never gotten before.  And living longer, because you look in that, in that, the heartbeat sensor thing, and now  you know where the motherfuckers are coming from.  I know.  It's fantastic.  I am going to be on there playing tonight like a maniac. 
[00:50:30]  Dude, but that's a lot of stress when you're playing a video game on Wi-Fi, man.  Online gaming on Wi-Fi.  That's ridiculous.  I know.  I plugged in the Ethernet cable right into the wall.  I'm like...  You want to be hardwired in.  You don't want anything happening when you're really into a game.  I know.  Well, it wasn't working at all.  So I've just plugged it into the wall.  And now speed, crazy, I'm fucking...  I'm killing people left and right.  All right.  Let's mark this, and then we'll go on and do some multiplayer later today, fellas.  And then we'll see...  All right, Rambo.  We'll see how much better he is. 
[00:51:00]  Look, I've seen your fucking scores.  You're not exactly calling in fucking tactical nukes at the end of the fucking game, are you?  No, but I'll...  I can finish top of the heap.  Well, let me tell you something.  Last night, I was fucking getting multiple kills to the point where I was getting equipment,  uh, uh, yeah, fucking, uh, uh...  I'm getting out of the air chain.  Not three kills, assholes.  Were you putting your UAV online?  No, that's three kills.  I don't even know what that means.  Multiple motherfuckers.  Big.  Big. 
[00:51:30]  I'm a new man on that game.  New man!  I'll fucking...  Get a room together.  Get a room together tonight, piss boys.  Come on, piss boys.  Get a room together tonight.  D-Boy clan will be in.  I want it.  D-Boy...  I'll fucking...  I want in.  Everyone's calling you a noob on, uh, SNP.  Fuck you, noob!  How am I a noob with a fucking weapon and equipment that, that, you know, you gotta at least play  for a little while with the fucking thing to even get the equipment.  Stop it.  I've been playing with the... 
[00:52:00]  What?  Sound like Keith now, because Keith...  Keith just sucks.  Keith will come in last every round.  Yes.  But he'll still get points.  Like, he'll play the ones where you get, you know, a decent amount, like Team Deathmatch,  not Team Deathmatch, like headquarters or something.  Headquarters.  So he gets all these points, but he'll come in last every time, so he levels up, and then  he tries to make fun of me.  He'll say, well, I got better level than you.  I'm like, yeah, but you come in last every time.  So just because you play doesn't mean that you're good.  Just because you have a higher level does not mean.  I was not coming in last every time last night.  All right.  Just because you have a heartbeat sensor doesn't mean shit, buddy. 
[00:52:30]  All right.  Oh, it means shit.  I'll see you coming around corners.  I'll see you...  I saw a guy around a corner.  I whipped around there.  Bam!  Nailed him.  Derek makes a good point.  What if I have my cold-blooded perk on, and then I don't show up on your stupid heartbeat  sensor?  All right.  Well, let me tell you something.  Not everyone does.  And I'll still fucking find you.  Game tonight.  Game on?  Game on.  D-Boy douchebags.  Okay.  Game on.  Let me go to Cleveland.  We got to go to break, and then we're going to get into the thing with Louis C.K. and  Nick.  That's what people are talking about.  We're going to get to the bottom of that.  But first, Cleveland. 
[00:53:00]  What's up?  Sorry about that.  Get you to the bottom of it in eight seconds.  I want to hear the clip, though.  But for some reason, you can't find it anymore.  We'll explain that after the break, though, because that's a whole thing.  Go ahead, Cleveland.  Morning, boys.  Morning.  Hey, I think the joke's on you with this bottle of wine.  It's not Peter Frannis.  It's Peter Frannis.  There were a lot of R's on the bottle.  And then Billie Jean is calling.  Our first Billie Jean of the morning. 
[00:53:30]  Billie Jean.  Hi, Billie Jean.  How are you?  This is Billie Jean.  I got a message for Dr. Steve.  Fair is fair.  If you're going to give in, go be a bottle of cheap wine.  Fair is fair.  Everybody knows $50 enough.  Fair is fair, Billie Jean.  Billie Jean.  Is that his catchphrase?  I guess fair is fair is going to be his.  Of course.  Yes.  And finally, we go to John in Denver.  And then we take our first break.  John in Denver, what's up?  Hello, Opie.  Good morning.  Good morning, John.  Did that wine, was it in a pouch with a straw glue to the back of it? 
[00:54:00]  Have you ever drank that shit with the buckets?  No.  Worst wine ever is that box of wine shit, though.  Box of wine?  I know the mother-in-law loved it, Ann.  Oh, she loved the box of wine.  That stuff was rough.  It took up the whole entire shelf in the refrigerator.  Where the milk and the eggs and the healthy stuff should have been in the refrigerator.  All that is supposed to be there, but I put the box of wine there.  Anthony, could you get me a glass of wine from the box? 
[00:54:30]  Yes.  The little spigot on the frail little box.  How big was the box of wine, for real?  It was you.  I remember, too.  It was at least a gallon.  It was a gallon of wine.  I think it might have been bigger.  In a plastic bag inside the box.  Right.  So you had the big box just sitting there, and you would hit the little thumb tap thing  and pour it out.  A glistening glass of white wine.  When I was living with your mother-in-law, I partook in some of the box of wine. 
[00:55:00]  How did you like it?  Well, it made it easier to make out with her.  So I doubt that ever happened.  My goodness, Opie.  You know, after you get past the wine breath, she wasn't that bad.  Box of wine.  Let's take a break.  All righty.  I have one thing to plug.  Thank you.  New Year's Eve, Fort Lauderdale, Florida Improv.  And this Friday, I make up my two dates in Bayshore, Illinois. 
[00:55:30]  I think it's sold out, but you can check.  I have to go to Fort Lauderdale now on New Year's Eve.  Holy shit, why don't we do that?  Why don't we do that?  Three nights.  New Year's Eve, New Year's Night, and then one night after, and I'm done.  Why don't we do that?  That would be so cool.  I'm happy to be going to Florida.  It's nice and warm.  Yes!  Me and Razzle Rizzo is my opener.  Let's drive down there.  Yeah, we'll take a drive.  I got a JetBlue flight.  Because the Continental was sold out.  Good for you.  That's good.  You watch TV.  Someone explain the 787 for me after the break, too.  The big dreamliner.  I know.  The ship goes up in the air. 
[00:56:00]  I know Ant would know a little bit about that new plane.  And I'll talk about the fatal flaw in it, too.  Oh, really?  No.  Just wanted to sound smart and not get sued.  Please don't say that.  There are already a couple billion in the hole.  You know, they're fine.  Because of delays and all that on the 787.  Quick break.  We'll continue.  Hit it.  You can leave my friggin' premises.  Goodbye.  Bye. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  What?  What?  Opie and Anthony, two days before we get the fuck out of here for a couple weeks.  Less than that.  Oh, yeah.  Now it's officially less than that.  You're right, Anthony.  Cool.  Hey, uh...  Whereas Mars once told me earlier in the week, he goes, only three more wake-ups.  He said, three more wake-ups. 
[00:57:00]  So now it's just one more wake-up to vacation.  God.  And then we get to live like human beings and sleep in a little bit.  Some of us.  Let's play why you can't pay your taxes.  Oh, yeah.  My God, man.  It's not getting better, Jimmy?  No.  Hey.  Now I'm depressed.  I'm damn depressed now.  Wow.  I think we need Sleeves Christmas on just to make everybody... 
[00:57:30]  No!  Oh, my God, no.  Jimmy's depressed.  I'm not depressed.  And if he's depressed, I'm depressed.  Disgusting.  I'm disappointed.  I'm disgusted.  I think we need Sleeves Christmas on to just...  Thank you.  Thank you, Travis.  Dude, this was in my head all day.  Thank you.  This will get you back, Jimmy.  La, la, la, la.  We say one thing, but do another.  La, la, la, la, la.  Smile in your face, but fuck you contractually.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Treat you like a piece of salla.  We think you're valuable, but you're just a pile of la, la, la, la, la. 
[00:58:00]  We really love la, la.  We don't love you.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Come to me.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  The whole time's in my mouth, la, la, la, la, la, la.  Say one thing, la, la, la, la.  But don't listen to anything I say, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.  But you're on Leno. 
[00:58:30]  They should respect you, Jimmy.  They don't give a fuck.  You're on Leno.  You're a regular on Leno at this point.  And red eye.  All right, just listen to the words.  Children in the night.  Will you just listen to the words?  No.  Holy night.  That's really pretty good.  Oh, just stop.  What do you hate him?  What did he ever do to you?  He wrote this. 
[00:59:00]  La, la, la, la.  Come with a problem.  I got it, I got it, I got it.  La, la, la, la.  I'm getting sure I get paid, but fuck you, scumbag.  La, la, la.  Pay your own legal.  La, la, la.  Competent agent.  La, la.  He's fired.  La, la, la, la, la, la, la.  You know, I wrote him yesterday.  He didn't even acknowledge I wrote him.  I have not spoken to our agent.  I guess he's now mad at me.  I don't care if he's mad at me.  He's done.  I'm done with it.  He didn't even acknowledge that I actually wrote him. 
[00:59:30]  Professionally, too, by the way.  Not one of my pissy emails.  Yeah.  I'm done.  He didn't even acknowledge that I sent him an email yesterday.  That's good.  All right, whatever.  We just got to try to get to tomorrow.  That's all we have to do, is just get to tomorrow, and then we'll regroup.  Here's your bill to the tickets to the la, la, la, la.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yes.  We really know how to take care of la, la, la, la.  If you have a suit and tie, la, la, la, la, la. 
[01:00:00]  But if you're talented, boo, boo, boo, boo.  Worst people in my life, la, la, la, la.  Jesus, thank God for NBC, la, la, la, la, la.  Thank God for Fox News, la, la, la, la.  And stand up, too.  At least you got a place to go, man.  Of course.  At least you got a place to go.  In all honesty, dude, I have no career discomfort whatsoever.  Jimmy's going to phone it in till la, la, la, la.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's why I'll do the show, la, la, la, la.  You know.  Yeah, exactly.  At least you got a place. 
[01:00:30]  You wouldn't even go on shows when we were kicked off the la, la, la, la.  You fucking cunty message board, la, la, la, la.  Drink a beer and talk to other eight people with the same fucking posts on the front page  for six, la, la, la, la.  You bag of shit, la, la, la, la.  Big comment in your post, la, la, la, la.  See, you guys enjoy the song.  Can we hear it again?  No.  What?  I'm just trying to get everyone in.  In the spirit of Christmas.  Dude, I really did think of this song a lot yesterday.  That's good.  I didn't want to.  Fucking CokeLogic's animation blew up yesterday. 
[01:01:00]  I literally, I hope it did.  I hope it literally blew up.  And I'm waiting for my thank you from CokeLogic's, that motherfucker.  Blowing up your video for you and I get nothing.  Nothing.  La, la, la, la.  I'm on a home with the la, la, la, la, la.  I'm making my way to the la, la, la, la, la.  He's making his way to the la, la, la, la.  Wouldn't it be funny if you just walked into a store and it said the la, la, la, la, la.  And you felt stupid?  No, I'm an idiot.  And it's a blowjob store where they just give out blowjobs for free.  And butt fingerings. 
[01:01:30]  What do you want to do?  Let's go to the la, la, la, la.  They can fucking blowjobs and butt fingerings for nothing.  Butt fingerings.  Oh.  Right.  I hate this.  Enough.  All right.  We can turn it down.  Hey, uh.  The whole Nick DiPaolo, Louis C.K. thing, man.  Yes.  That I want to hear about, la, la, la.  I can't find the fucking Clint yanked.  Why is it yanked?  Louis had it yanked.  But what?  Louis had it yanked.  Yes.  Oh.  From what I understand.  Well, I don't even know what it's about.  I heard Louis.  I do tell.  I heard Louis C.K. and Nick DiPaolo got into it over politics or something. 
[01:02:00]  On what show?  What were the circumstances?  I don't know.  What are people saying?  I mean, I don't know.  I don't know.  Oh, okay.  Was it on another radio show?  No, I don't think so.  Dr. Steve knew about it.  He tweeted it.  What did he say?  Well, he just said.  He said how unbelievable it was.  I'm like, thanks, Dr. Steve, but I haven't heard it.  So how about a link that I can click on?  Well, maybe we could have asked him about it if someone hadn't rudely hung up on the  good doctor.  Can we call fucking ass hair wine and just see?  Because you know Dr. Steve's wine, when he runs out of ass hair, he liquefies skin 
[01:02:30]  tags.  And that one really gives it its flavor.  Yuck.  This, I guess.  We should send raw material down to Dr. Steve so he can make his next batch of wine.  It's easy to find.  Just go through your front yard.  I'm willing to give up some of my fluids.  Are you?  Sure.  Yeah.  A little piss.  A little shit.  A little shit.  I have no idea what the problem was.  Apparently they had an argument.  La, la, la, la, la.  Got out of hand.  La, la, la. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah?  But where?  Who was it?  How was their tape of this?  Okay, okay.  Here it is.  Here it is.  I know Jimmy doesn't want to be gossip-gurdy, which is fine.  But who, was anyone on stage at the time?  Not sure.  Oh, okay.  Wait, you know about this, obviously.  I've heard something about it.  So, could you fill in some of the blanks?  Who's going up that mountain in that thing?  What?  That's rock climbing.  Oh my God, that's crazy.  You've never rock climbed?  No!  That's insanity.  In South Africa, you've got to rock climb.  That's how you get away from the fucking people who are trying to cut your head off. 
[01:03:30]  Fucking whiny.  That's safer.  All right, Dr. Steve is back on the line.  La, la, la, la.  Drunk from his own ass hair.  La, la, la.  Dr. Steve?  Hello, shitty wine giver.  How are you?  Now, I enjoyed your wine.  It was fun.  I don't know what happened.  All of a sudden, I seem to have been...  I must have hit the end button on my...  Nope.  It's called learn your lesson.  Operator, I think we've been disconnected.  Oh, operator. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah.  What's the Nick DiPaolo...  Yelling, those assholes hung up on me.  What's the Nick DiPaolo, Louis C.K. thing?  All right.  Well, when I first heard it, it was on YouTube, and it got yanked, and it seemed very real.  They were arguing about politics, and Nick said that Obama was only in because of white guilt, 
[01:04:30]  and Louis C.K. made a Nazi reference, and Nick got mad and said,  look, my dad fought the Nazis, don't call me a Nazi, and Louis C.K. said,  okay, I won't call you that, you fucking Nazi, and then all of a sudden, you hear this scuffle.  Yeah.  It went on for about 30 seconds, 45 seconds, and then you hear Nick go,  ow, ow, I cut my hand, you fucking lunatic, or something like that, and then that was the end of it.  Well, Louis then posted something on his blog that said that it was part of a show that they were doing, 
[01:05:00]  and that it was fake, and that it was tightly scripted, but they improvised it,  but some extra on the set leaked it, and he was very upset because now the, you know,  the production was contaminated by everybody seeing this.  Oh, yeah.  I saw Nick last night.  The whole thing was just a bit that they were doing for Louis' new show.  Wow.  Some fucking extra recorded that and fucking posted it.  You fucking believe it? 
[01:05:30]  What a douche.  What's that?  He posted it as if it was real.  That fucking cocksucker.  I hope that fucking guy never works again for violating that on a set.  Wow, that's fucked up.  All right, it makes sense now.  What a prick.  Really despicable.  Yeah, it was bad.  Dude.  And I actually did my second post because I had just posted something like,  what the heck was that about?  Language, Steve.  And I got, somebody posted me a link to Louis' blog,  and I did post that on my Twitter just so everybody would know it was fake. 
[01:06:00]  I would love to get Louis on the phone and just see how he feels about this extra posting.  Of course.  Oh, he's probably livid.  Louis called us last week, I think it was.  He listens every morning, so.  No, he doesn't.  I swear to God he does.  He's fucking passed out in his fucking diaper-like undershorts.  Oh, he really listens.  On his fucking stomach with his red freckles.  Fuck Louis and his mother's cunt with a fucking rolled up newspaper.  All right, Steve.  He's got freckles on his penis.  I still don't understand what Nick was upset about. 
[01:06:30]  Well, that's what I told Nick.  I saw Nick last night, and I said, what gave it away from me was when I even heard it.  Oh, we got Louis right here.  Oh, okay.  Hold on, man.  Louis's a big star.  Dark Steve, you want to have the pleasure of being on the phone with Louis?  Absolutely.  All right.  But the point is, does Louis want the disgrace?  Oh, no.  Good.  You are a douche.  Louis!  Hey.  Hi, Lou.  What the fuck's...  What's up, guys? 
[01:07:00]  Who's there?  Hi.  We got Jimmy.  Jimmy Norton, and Anthony, and Opie, and Danny.  Yes.  Uh-huh.  We heard about the whole brouhaha, Lou.  Yeah, everyone's calling us about this clip, and I guess we're trying to get to the bottom  of it.  Yeah, it was...  We were shooting a scene for my show with Nick playing pretty much himself and me playing  myself.  And the idea was just that we get...  You know, like I do, first you see me on stage, and then you see Nick on stage doing 
[01:07:30]  his inflammatory right-wing material.  And the crowd doesn't like one of his jokes, and we were upstairs at the cellar, I mean  at the all-street, and he says, those people are hypocrites.  And I start giving him shit for being very...  I do it all the time.  I'm like, hey, well, maybe you did better at the Hitler Youth Rally.  Right there again.  And, you know, he's like, ha-ha, liberal douche, and whatever.  We're just giving each other shit.  But then it ratchets up, and it gets ugly. 
[01:08:00]  But it was scripted and planned.  You know, it was a written piece.  But it's funny, because the idea was I wanted it to seem really nasty.  I wanted it to get out of hand.  Right.  I wanted it to feel like we don't curse until, like, not really, until we start getting into  the fight, and we start saying, fuck a lot.  And I'm going to bleep those.  But it's supposed to feel like we were shooting a scene, and it got ugly.  That was the way it was scripted. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah, I got it.  Aw.  But so...  That's a good date.  I'm going to make breakfast for my kids right now.  Anyway, so we shot it a few times, and, you know, we did a pretty real fight, like a  little, just, you know, really awkward guys in their 40s, flapping and then grappling,  you know?  Yeah.  And so we did it a few times, and then some guy who was an extra on the show, somebody  who we hired, some, you know, fucking asshole, brought some device and recorded it. 
[01:09:00]  And he posted it on his Twitter, saying that it was a real fight.  Jesus.  What a fucking piece of shit, dude.  No, it's the most obnoxious thing anybody's...  I mean, here's the thing.  For my feeling is that if an audience member comes and records shit, and they YouTube it,  it's really annoying, but I get it.  Because they just don't have the same...  They're just not in the same world.  They don't get what in the ass that is.  But this is a fucking person who we hired, who we paid to help us on the shoot. 
[01:09:30]  And he did this.  It's just really...  Because now it's, like, contaminated, the shows going on the...  You know, I don't want that material out there.  Of course.  I don't want it to be on the Howard Stern show.  And also, I got Nick to go to extremes of his political views, and I did on my end, too.  Neither of us believe any of that shit.  We're just getting mad.  Yeah, so in the context of just, hey, this is real, it makes you guys look like fucking, you know, assholes. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, to both extremes, because I don't think we're Republicans or Nazis.  That's the dumbest thing I've ever said.  And, you know, he doesn't say shit like white guilt.  That's a very cheesy version of Nick, but I pushed him to do it because he got us to this place.  And also, Nick and I have known each other.  We used to be roommates.  We've known each other for 23 years.  We never have agreed politically, but we can talk.  Of course.  The thing that's great is, and this is where I knew, because I know you guys, that I thought it was...  When I heard the word, like, you called Nick a Nazi, and he went,  My dad fought the Nazis, knowing Nick. 
[01:10:30]  That wouldn't have gotten him mad enough to be physical, because I know the guy.  Yeah, I'm a Nazi.  By the way, his dad was seven in World War II.  Exactly.  And he wouldn't have fought the Nazis anyway.  He would have given them rides.  His dad was a real badass.  Or he fought for the Germans, who were the youth seven-year-olds.  Exactly.  So what happened now with this fucking extra?  What's that?  What happened with this extra now?  What did you fucking...  Well, we're going after him. 
[01:11:00]  I mean, I've never wanted to, like, you know...  I mean, I don't know.  I guess I've got to be careful, because my lawyers are writing them letters and stuff.  Lawyers, that's good.  Good.  Exactly.  In this case, it's warranted.  When you violate that on a set, when you record private material and post it, like, what a...  Did he get anything personal out of it?  Like, did he appear anywhere with it?  No.  He put it on his Twitter.  It's funny how fast stuff goes.  He put it on his Twitter, and it went up.  And then next thing you know, it's on YouTube, because somebody...  I think it's a fan of you guys. 
[01:11:30]  It's one of your peeps, type of people.  I know an A fan.  Right.  I found it, and so there was two pieces, and he put them together, and he put pictures  over it.  You know how people do that now?  Oh, right, right, right.  And so he did that, and he put it up.  Now, the YouTube guy is where they were.  The Stern Show got it, and that's where it got most of its exposure.  Jesus.  Even off of YouTube.  But I wrote that guy right away and said, take this shit down.  It's not meant to be out there.  And he took it down right away.  The YouTube guy felt bad. 
[01:12:00]  He didn't need to know.  Once it's out there, then everybody else has a right to go at it.  Yeah, he didn't know.  He was just posting what he thought was newsworthy, and the violator is the extra.  I know you don't want to say who he is.  That's fine, but was he an actor, or is he a comedian?  He's an actor.  He's not anybody I know, and he's an extra.  I mean, you know, they like to be called background, but who gives a shit?  He's a guy who couldn't get fucking speaking parts.  He's an extra, and his Twitter page says that he's a filmmaker extraordinaire, and he 
[01:12:30]  has a headshot of himself, like with his arm up, like with his hands behind his head.  No.  Yeah.  If you go on Twitter, his Twitter name is Robert E. Taylor, all one word.  All right.  Robert, the letter E, Taylor, all one word.  If you search for people on Twitter, you'll see his stupid face.  There it is.  Oh, look at the picture.  Oh, look at this guy.  By the way, on the set, I remember him.  I remember looking over and going, ugh. 
[01:13:00]  What is that guy doing here?  Hey, hey, can you get that picture better?  Yeah, blow that picture up.  I want to see that horrid, fucking awful, hack actor picture.  We actually moved him.  He was sitting right behind me in the scene, but we moved him because he was wearing this  powder green shirt that was just stupid.  His smoldering look really annoys me.  Oh, yeah.  He's got his bedroom eyes on. 
[01:13:30]  That's laying back.  He's taken down all of the stuff that he posted, because he also posted a picture of me taking  I was taking a nap between takes in a closed set, surrounded by my crew and cast.  I took a nap, and he took a picture of it and posted it and said, this is him after the  fight.  But what a fucking asshole.  And he thought this was going to work out for him?  I don't know what he did.  What a dummy, man.  People just don't care.  And again, I'm going to say again, that if it was just a person who's outside of show 
[01:14:00]  business who thinks, hey, cool, look who I got inside of this.  I was at this show, and I saw something weird happen.  Yeah, of course.  I get it, but this is a person who...  That you hired.  I mean, it's two things.  It's just a generational thing that people don't, when they're working for somebody,  they don't understand that that's a sacred thing.  Somebody's paying you, so you should want to do your best for them.  But, you know, so part of it is just me, I'm 42, looking at this guy who's probably  20-whatever, hope he's dead soon, whatever, however many years. 
[01:14:30]  You know, his age of nine months ago that his disgusting parents shoved their fucking  penis and vagina together.  Jesus, awesome.  But, you know what, Louie, even though he is young, there's certain things that you just  know.  Again, like you said, he's an audience member, they just don't live in the world, but he's  a guy who should know better.  He's on a set.  You don't fucking do that on a set, ever.  I'm a fucking picture whore, and I love photos.  I would never ask on an active set, ever. 
[01:15:00]  It certainly isn't going to help them, obviously, so...  I don't care about sharing.  I've always said, like, sometimes people come to my shows, and they put my show, like, they'll  record it on their cell phone, they put it on YouTube.  I never get mad at these people or tell them, like, I don't go, you're stealing from me.  Right.  I just tell them, hey, this is new stuff, and you're actually hurting me creatively.  I'm trying to put this stuff out carefully.  And they always take it down.  This isn't about, like, someone stole my property.  It's about, let me finish the fucking show before people hear it, idiot. 
[01:15:30]  Yeah, there's a...  And, you know, Louie is about sharing.  It's like Louie's motto is share and share alike.  I've heard him say it many times.  It's on bumper stickers that he sells after shows.  I'm not against sharing.  Fuck your mother.  I'm going to say, I saw your mother is about the virus.  My mother's not about the virus.  She is the virus.  Her name is actually AIDS Norton.  Oh, my God.  That's amazing.  That is amazing.  And, Louie, now the big bummer is you probably can't use this material now.  Well, I'll use it.  You'll figure out a way to make it work?  No, I mean, it's just one scene inside of an episode. 
[01:16:00]  And, I mean, I will say the one positive feeling I get out of it is that we acted it well enough that folks bought it to a large degree.  Sure.  I got a lot of emails from people saying, I can't believe that you got in a fight with Nick DiPaolo.  And the great thing is, because I wrote it, I win the fight, I cut his hand, and he starts going, get off me.  That is hilarious.  That is awesome.  I can't watch DiPaolo.  Get off me.  Look, I played football in college.  Bitch.  Bitch DiPaolo.  Nick broke his hand.  I've never run more than 14 feet, and he's going, get off me. 
[01:16:30]  Like, I'm hurting him.  Nick broke his hand, punching a heckler.  That's why I really adored DiPaolo.  He injured himself physically, fighting for all comics.  I just love his ideology.  You know, and by the way, the other point of this thing was that Nick and I, we've been opposite sides of the political spectrum our whole lives.  We've always gotten along, and I feel like that's also a generational thing, because people can't do that anymore.  Right.  With Glenn Beck and all the, and Ariana Huffington, nobody can be friends. 
[01:17:00]  Or the Al Frankens.  And disagree anymore.  Oh, Anthony.  And Janine Garofalo.  All right.  Well, he said Huffington.  What do you have to do with those, then?  He said Huffington.  I don't care.  She's very, very left.  Oh, yeah.  Louis threw one of each in.  I don't care.  I throw all of the one side in.  See how I balanced it in?  I put it in both.  I don't.  That's right.  Share and share alike, and let's all get along.  Those are Lou's mottos.  What do you want to do?  You want to fight now, Lou?  Yeah.  Tough guy?  Yes.  I'm a freckled pile of shit.  That's another one of his mottos. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, there you go.  We got to the bottom.  Yeah, yeah.  I saw Nick last night.  Nick was saying how great the piece was.  He goes, dude, it's one of the best things I've ever done on film.  He might have said it's the best thing he's ever done on film.  He was really raving about you.  Yeah, I didn't know what the fuck was up.  Maybe sick.  My Twitter exploded.  I'm like, I don't fucking know.  And then the link was gone.  I'm like, then.  No, Nick was great, by the way.  He's so good in the bit.  He's like, when we did the fight, and we're standing there, he throws water in my face.  And then we're standing there, and he does the thing about my father. 
[01:18:00]  And he's so real.  I don't want to, you know.  To me, he's like what De Niro used to be before he just became a weirdo.  Why, he's great.  I haven't seen anybody get that angry on film in an interesting way in a long time.  Right.  That's cool.  Now I want to see it.  Yeah.  In the proper context.  You mean before De Niro started doing awful press conferences?  You know, for those of you that know me in New York, there might be a bull here that rages too. 
[01:18:30]  Boo.  Boo.  He cannot say anything interesting.  Dude, he can't tell a fucking joke.  He's terrible.  It's horrid.  All equity gone.  Yeah.  I got to go take my kids to school, guys.  You're adorable.  All right, Louis.  See you, Lou.  Thanks, Lou.  Thanks, bud.  See you.  Take care.  There you go.  Look forward to my call for hopefully doing my Louis CK piece.  Oh!  Is it happening?  I hope so.  Hopefully somebody will take it.  Is it in the works?  I want to play a billionaire.  Jesus. 
[01:19:00]  A mogul.  Yeah?  All right.  What will your name be?  What?  What would your name be?  Billionaire Jimmy.  We're going to take a break.  Yeah, take a break.  We'll be talking about breaks.  Marmalade fortune.  Break.  And other things after the break.  Break everything.  Careful.  Well, fuck him too.  Opie and Anthony.  God damn it, I want to get that.  Now you've got to buy it.  I don't care. 
[01:19:30]  I'll buy it.  Gene Simmons is on TV.  He blew off our show.  I don't know what he's doing.  He's not eating on the facility, though.  He's not here.  Don't defend him.  I'm being honest.  He can still like the guy, but don't defend him.  Fuck Gene Simmons.  I would.  He's hawking a big book, I guess.  A big coffee cable kiss book, and he's signing.  I'll leave him at Borders.  I don't know when, though.  In the time we're going to go.  I might go.  His hair looks ridiculous.  What's going on there?  It looks ridiculous.  I want that fucking book badly. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Go buy it.  You want me to buy it?  I'll buy it.  Yes.  All right.  Kiss canendium or whatever?  Merry Christmas.  All right.  I'll buy it for Jimmy.  Someone get Jimmy the kiss book.  I want Gene to sign it.  Jimmy needs to be happy.  I want Gene to sign it.  I'll sign it as Gene.  No problem.  I'm trying to figure out what he's done with his hair.  It's a wig.  Yeah.  So he's got a lot of money.  Get a good wig.  That's horrendous.  And it looks like it's spray painted on that left side.  It's not a natural flowing looking wig.  It looks like cotton candy.  The best line was in the roast. 
[01:20:30]  When Lisa Lampanelli said, I've seen better rugs in the back of a rape van.  That to me was the best line of the roast.  That's fucking funny.  He's just slamming his wig.  When is she going to come on our show?  I ran into her on the street.  She wants to do our show, but she's scared how the other people are going to take it.  Just come on our show.  Thank you, worst hat in history.  Shitty knit hat.  Get away from me.  Why are you wearing that hat?  Exactly.  What are you doing?  Who cares?  It's a bunch of guys. 
[01:21:00]  Wow.  It's got like straight black hair.  What the fuck is your problem?  I want you to throw your hat away right now.  Please.  Oh, my God.  No, no.  He said now.  The boss said now.  Wow.  He's fucking leaving.  Now.  He just walked the fuck out of the studio.  He must really like that hat, huh?  What a way to fucking get on the radio show.  There's a potential thing for him to do, and he just sneaks out of the office.  Or studio.  Whatever word.  La la la la.  La la la la la la la la la la la la la.  We got a Tiger Woods song.  We got a conspiracy theory promo by intern Matt. 
[01:21:30]  Feeling pretty good.  I feel pretty good.  La la la.  And we got a visit from...  St. Nicholas.  Narrated by Big A and Stalker Patty.  Produced by Derek D-Boy.  D-Boy involved in something there?  How about we do your Tiger Woods news?  We'll make it quick today.  On the front page again.  On the front page again, Ant.  Hell.  Well, he's the athlete of the decade.  Athlete of the decade.  And someone had a hacky line online. 
[01:22:00]  They said, Tiger Woods, athlete of the decade.  And he's pretty good at sports, too.  I get it.  They mean fucking boo.  Yes, they do.  I don't like the booing, guys.  It's just mean-spirited.  Elin has made up her mind, according to multiple reports, and will divorce Tiger Woods and seek  up to a half a billion dollars.  What?  A half a billion dollars.  Tiger's high school sweetheart, jump in any time, says that Tiger was deeply hurt by his 
[01:22:30]  father cheating on his mother.  She's now talking.  The high school sweetheart has to get her fucking 15 minutes of fame.  Elin also said, no more dating c**t.  She learned her lesson.  You think she's done?  Uh, yeah.  No, yeah.  With the marriage and all?  You think this is it?  Yeah, I think that's it.  She's getting it.  I think a divorce is imminent.  I think what put her over was the fact that he never took the marriage seriously. 
[01:23:00]  Never, yeah.  I mean, people are cheating out there, and they're able to work it out somehow.  You could at least go, maybe we can bring it back like when we first got married and  the romance.  And she's like, what, when you were banging 15 broads the day after we got married?  Even Pauly can't help this out.  I'll talk to her.  I'll tell her, look, when you come back, everything will be like when you just got married, the  romance.  But you gotta go back.  You gotta go back.  There's no going back.  She'll look like a complete tool if she goes back. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Wow.  I still get excited when I see kiss.  Why?  I don't know.  You are really a weirdo.  I know.  I'm sorry.  I don't know why I do.  I just...  I love when it says weirdo.  It's just a strange fixation to have.  I don't know why.  You're a little baby.  So you're mad that they're not in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame again?  Oh, yeah.  Disgusted.  Not that...  You know what, dude?  They just should be.  It's ridiculous.  Stop with this cool fucking attitude. 
[01:24:00]  They put ABBA in.  To say ABBA doesn't deserve it, though.  You know what?  It's like...  That's my reaction as a Kiss fan, but ABBA's record sales worldwide were fucking massive.  So it's based on record sales?  No, no.  I'm only saying they're very big.  But ABBA was more disco than Rock and Roll, aren't they?  Not disco.  Like...  They were poppy, pop, pop, pop, pop.  Yeah, they're poppy, pop, pop.  In fact, so ABBA was put in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame over Kiss.  Well, how many units did ABBA sell?  A lot, I'm sure.  I mean, more than Kiss.  And then they had a fucking... 
[01:24:30]  Supposedly, they hate each other, and there's deals on the table where...  I forgot what the number was.  We talked about it on the show, where they want to pay ABBA a ridiculous amount of money  to get back together.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  But they hate each other so much that they can't even do it just for the money.  No, huh?  But the fuck out...  Yeah, give me the story of ABBA, because it's pretty amazing what happened to these guys.  They hate each other, and they refuse to get back together for just a boatload of cash.  The fact that Kiss is not in the hall is fucking disgusting.  It's ridiculous.  It is what the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is, and I'm glad I attacked him in my book, because 
[01:25:00]  they're fucking shit.  They really are shit.  Yeah.  To not put Kiss in is fucking despicable.  Kiss pretty...  Had a really good run.  Continues to have a good run.  Continues to have a good run.  So you know what?  Continues to have a good run.  Continues to have a good run.  They really did fucking...  I mean, they were the biggest rock band in the world.  They were, like, larger than life.  You know...  Steve from Bayshore says, Kiss shouldn't even be allowed to visit the Hall of Fame.  That's not true.  He's not a big fan, I guess.  I understand that.  He likes Elvis, and, you know, that's fair enough. 
[01:25:30]  The Hall of Fame.  Yeah, exactly.  Shoo-be-do-be-do-be-douche, Steve.  But, you know, look.  Elvis was a one-hit wonder.  Let's be honest with you, Sean.  I don't like a Jew.  One-hit wonder.  Yeah, so you got the story of ABBA?  Danny's working on that.  Okay.  No Kiss.  You get the ABBA, and you get Genesis.  I'll give you ABBA.  I used to love the Genesis. 
[01:26:00]  But you want to talk about a band that just fucking disappointed all their fans.  Genesis would be that band.  That would be a good bit.  A band that completely disappointed all their fans.  When I got into Genesis, and what they became by the end, it unrecognizable.  Are you talking Genesis now, Phil Collins Genesis?  I even like the Peter Gabriel stuff.  Are you talking Peter Gabriel Genesis?  That's really trippy and artsy, though.  Most people aren't going to really, you know, jump on the Peter Gabriel Genesis bandwagon.  You're saying the Phil Collins Genesis in any of its incarnations was ever good to the point where when, toward the end, they sucked? 
[01:26:30]  I liked it.  You ever hear Duke?  This is Duke.  I've eaten at Duke.  A Duke-y.  You ever hear Duke for real?  No.  That was fucking some solid Genesis.  Was that solid Genesis?  I don't know.  I don't remember the time. 
[01:27:00]  Look, we're not really rocking out.  I get it.  I'm not trying to, you know.  But I liked, yeah, I liked Genesis when they did the Duke stuff.  Abacab wasn't bad at it.  Yeah.  It wasn't bad, but that was the turning point.  And then after that, it was like.  So which songs do you consider suck-ass Genesis songs?  I'd have to look at a list now, because it's been a while.  But like Illegal Alien, Horrendous.  Yeah, that's horrible.  Fucking Help Me Out with some fucking Genesis Somebody.  That album where it had the yellow and fucking brown looking boxes.  I forgot the name of the album, even. 
[01:27:30]  Look down, bro.  Someone help us out.  I can see Opie with a skinny pink tie and a straw up his nose.  Listening to that.  Yeah.  I'm a Brit, and we thought Genesis sucked.  From the beginning?  Even the older stuff?  The Genesis song, I Can't Dance, Horrible.  There you go, I Can't Dance.  Thank you.  Yes.  Yeah, that's just not the same band anymore. 
[01:28:00]  All right.  The album with the yellow blocks?  Yeah, yeah.  It's Genesis.  Yeah, it just said Genesis.  What were some of the songs in that?  I don't even remember anymore.  I don't even think I bought that album.  I think I was out at that point.  Invisible Touch?  Invisible Touch, yes.  Well, Illegal Alien was on that album.  Yeah, I know that.  No, that was Phil Collins when he was doing his solo thing.  I know that much.  Land of Confusion?  Yeah, Land of Confusion.  They were all very just over-the-top poppy.  And then they just faded away. 
[01:28:30]  Poor Genesis.  Poor Without Frontiers?  Whatever.  No one's going to give a shit about a Genesis discussion, I understand.  But Genesis will be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  The Stooges?  I don't know anything about the Stooges.  I don't either.  You just fucking hear their name all the time.  But I couldn't name you one Stooges song.  And that's probably a shame on my part.  That's the too-cool-for-the-room kind of induction thing, I think, right there.  The Stooges?  Yeah.  They come up all the time in discussion.  But who gives a shit?  Except, you know, I bet Bennington likes them. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah, and then they go with Second Home by the Sea.  See, they got lazy even.  Let's just call the song Second Home by the Sea.  Yeah, Taking It All Too Hard.  Very poppy.  Just a job to do.  Yeah, I remember this album.  It's going to get better.  Mama.  Mama was cool.  Now, I'm not saying all the bands that are inducted are Too Cool for the Room.  They always have.  Obviously, ABBA, not Too Cool for the Room.  But, again, a very popular, popular band.  They follow a pattern.  Yeah.  They go with one massively popular band.  In this case, it would be Genesis, because they did have their time. 
[01:29:30]  You've got to admit that.  Then they go.  Well, ABBA was very popular.  But then they go with some kind of, like, poppy.  They go in another genre.  And then they do, like Anne's saying, the Too Cool for the Room band, which would be the Stooges this time around.  It's a formula every single year.  And then they do the very old band, which is the Hollies.  The Hollies are in?  Yeah.  Why weren't the Hollies in before this?  Were they in as Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young?  Was Graham Nash in there twice?  Like, how do they do that?  And then is Neil Young in?  And is Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young in? 
[01:30:00]  Yeah, you can get in.  Is Crosby, Stills, and Nash in?  You can get in multiple times, yeah.  Crosby in?  Yeah, you can do that.  That's crazy.  Yeah, like Paul McCartney went in as the Beatles and then as Paul McCartney.  And did he go in as Wings as well?  I don't know.  Wings got to be in there, right?  Is Wings in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?  If Wings isn't in there, it's a travesty.  They had a fucking run.  It's a travesty.  One of the greatest, greatest hits albums of all time is the Wings' greatest hits.  What's on it?  I mean, I don't like it.  I probably wouldn't like it.  I think that's a good song.  I mean, they really do.  It's a pretty solid greatest hit.  Somebody's ringing the bell. 
[01:30:30]  Are they?  Induction year 1989?  That's good.  For Paul McCartney himself?  99, sorry.  Do-doot, do-doot, do-do-do-doot, do-doot.  And you got the Stooges fans coming forward.  I knew this would happen and that's fine.  Let's learn a little bit today.  Here we go.  Here we go, man.  Let's learn a little bit.  Go ahead, man.  Tell me about the Stooges because this is what they're all going to say.  Go ahead.  Let's say how to Peter, Massachusetts.  I was just going to say, why don't you play that song, Search and Destroy?  You might like it.  Yeah, the Stooges influenced a lot of bands, man. 
[01:31:00]  All right, we get it.  They did.  Influenced so wide.  Instead of being so goddamn closed-minded,  let's take a listen to this.  That's exactly right, Opie.  Let's take a listen to this Stooges show.  This show is very closed-minded sometimes.  Let's listen.  All the time, constantly.  I'll open my mind.  I'll have an open mind.  Open your mind.  Here's the Stooges going into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  That's the Stooges? 
[01:31:30]  No, I'm just singing over it.  That was the Ramones.  I'm a ski-walking cheater with a hat full of name, Pound.  Boo!  I'm a runaway son of a nuclear aid, Pound.  I am a world's soul, goddamn boy.  The one who searches and destroys.  But you gotta help me, please.  Somebody gotta save my soul. 
[01:32:00]  Baby, tell me, oh, baby.  Oh!  Look out of love.  All right, it's early, punkish shit.  Okay.  I'm not saying it's horrible,  but I'm embarrassed to say I've never heard this song before in my life.  I just kind of like it.  Yeah, it's not bad.  This guy would be like, yeah, the influence, like the Clash and shit.  All right. 
[01:32:30]  Well, Lust for Life isn't a Stooges song.  Wasn't that Iggy Pop on his own?  I'm not sure.  Yeah, that's Iggy on his own.  Yeah, it was.  Okay.  Yeah, I love Lust for Life.  This line's picked it up.  Matt would bust off of that, I bet.  That was kind of a bummer to hear it on a fucking commercial.  Man, man, what a sellout, man.  Man, you're all selling out, man.  It sounds like the band that was playing on that episode of Quincy.  We're looking for Abigail. 
[01:33:00]  Hey, what I was going to say is that...  Yes?  You want to talk in on the mic?  Yeah, Eric Clapton.  I like saying that to professionals.  Eric Clapton is in the Hall of Fame three times.  With, let me guess, Eric Clapton alone,  with Cream,  and with that other band he was in.  I would go with.  I'm just guessing.  I'm not looking anywhere.  No, I don't know.  Don't look.  I'm just going to guess and say Derek and the Dominoes. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, I was going to say that.  Wait, what other band was he in, though?  That's it.  No, there's a few.  There's some other ones.  I would say, yeah,  Derek and the Dominoes, Cream,  and just solo Clapton.  Do you like Clapton?  Yeah, I like some Clapton.  I like the Clapton.  It could get a little fucking repetitive.  I don't like bluesy shit.  God, why?  It kills me.  Why?  Because it's repetitive garbage.  Because it's the black man's music?  I was taking a cab ride recently 
[01:34:00]  to a little place in Huntington  on Main Street in Huntington.  It's called F.H. Rylance.  It's not on Main Street.  Excuse me.  New York Avenue.  Thank you.  It's off of Main Street.  It's not off Main Street.  It's on New York Avenue in Huntington.  Yeah, Main Street is where the bums hang out.  That's where I got food poisoning.  You get food poisoning on Main Street.  Okay.  Not on New York Avenue.  Yes, New York Avenue.  That's the snooty part.  I was taking a cab ride there. 
[01:34:30]  I was amazed when you told me that story, by the way.  That I took a cab?  And why are we talking about this on the air?  Anthony, to show support for my brother's restaurant,  something I did not do, by the way, on Saturday.  Yes, you were catching some flack.  And I should, and I apologize,  but I had some shit going on.  But Anthony...  Yardbirds.  Was it the Yardbirds?  He was in the Yardbirds.  The Yard what?  Was that the third thing, though?  I'm not sure.  It has to be Yardbirds over dirt on the dominoes.  Yeah, you took a cab all the way to F.H. Riley's. 
[01:35:00]  Yes, and home, of course,  because that's the treacherous part of driving home.  Which, by the way, you're fucking insane  because I've been in a few cabs on Long Island.  It's bad enough to take a cab in the city,  and I know a lot of the cabbies listen to us,  but they're lunatics.  The ones on Long Island, they're all fucking meth heads.  Thank you.  They're completely insane.  Thank you.  They're crazy.  And they're all white guys, which scares me.  Thank you.  When you see a white cab driver in the New York area,  that scares the shit out of me.  I'd rather have a guy that doesn't speak English  in the front of that cab.  I'm telling you the guy's honest truth now. 
[01:35:30]  This is where the story was going.  They got crazy eyes, kooky eyes.  Thank you.  They try to sell you shit.  Exactly what my point is.  For real?  Yes.  All right, go ahead.  I took a cab to F.H. Reilly's  with the lovely and talented Danny Ross.  He's neither of those things.  Yes, he is.  We were driving, and this gentleman,  again, white cab driver,  seemed from the area.  Crazy eyes.  Crazy eyes.  Greasy hair.  Crazy hat and everything like that. 
[01:36:00]  He goes,  Hey, you mind if I put a little Joe Walsh?  James Gang.  Was it James Gang, right?  Funk 49?  Yeah, yeah.  A little Joe Walsh in James Gang.  And what are you going to say?  No to the guy?  It's like, oh, gives a shit.  Not a bad choice, though,  if you're a little fucking drunk.  Now, this is the stuff that I can't stand  because it's these self-serving guitar solos  that lasted like the whole drive. 
[01:36:30]  I had to listen to fucking one guitar solo.  Did you hear one song?  One song.  Because it's probably a half hour ride,  I'm thinking, right?  Yeah, exactly.  More or less.  You're trying to tell me you heard one Joe Walsh song?  I heard one Joe Walsh song.  I might have heard, like, the end of one  and then into a guitar solo that was...  I was sitting there rolling my eyes just going,  enough of this fucking guitar solo.  Was it Life of Illusion?  I don't even...  Living a Life of Illusion?  I don't even know which one it was.  Mark 49?  Now, look, I actually... 
[01:37:00]  I'm an Eagles fan.  I like Joe Walsh's stuff.  But here...  Yell at me.  Jimmy just...  Yell at Jimmy.  We just yell at each other.  But this is blues influence.  It's not like hardcore blues.  No, I don't even like that.  You don't even like the blues influence?  I don't like anything that goes...  In the background.  It could be like a whole band doing it  with a guitar doing a lead.  It's too repetitive.  It goes on and on.  I think you're from Norway. 
[01:37:30]  Which one is this?  Frank 49?  Oh, come on now.  Now, we know this.  No, this is like a hit.  This is a hit off of this.  Yeah, you had some obscure Joe Walsh shit.  I'm talking some fucking song that...  I want to know what song it was now.  It's just a guitar lead that went on and on.  A Joe Walsh song that you've never heard of.  Well, that's 20 minutes long.  20 to 30 minutes long.  Find one of the long ones.  Oh, look at that one.  What's stop at the end down there? 
[01:38:00]  It could have been stop.  Look, it's fucking 12 minutes long.  There's a nine minute song.  You want the longest one I have?  I don't need it yet.  What's the name of the longest Joe Walsh song you got?  The one that we have in here is Turn to Stone.  Oh, they cut the shit out of that to make it fit on radio.  Did they?  How long is Turn to Stone in there?  8.47.  Jesus.  Give them a piece.  Let's see if this was it.  I don't know what album this guy had, but there was a live track on there, and that might have 
[01:38:30]  been the one, because it was just, dude, it went on forever.  Have you ever been in a cab where the guy makes a stop to get his drugs before he drops  you off?  Nope.  Just because he's going that way?  I, uh, if you've, if you're keeping up at the store, I usually don't take cabs, which  is, but I was being a little safe that evening.  Smart.  I use the force sometimes.  It wasn't this song.  No.  No, this wasn't.  Uh, everyone's saying play Stop.  It has to be that song.  It's got to be Stop. 
[01:39:00]  Stop is off that album.  It's a Joe Walsh album?  It's, uh.  No, no, it's a song.  James.  Right.  James Gang.  James Gang.  Go James Gang.  Stop.  Go James Gang.  Stop.  Go James Gang.  Stop.  So the blues just killed you on the camera.  Yeah.  I can't fucking take it.  Okay.  You never got into Muddy Waters?  Any of those guys?  No.  Oh.  No.  You don't like Muddy Waters?  No.  I need something that changes. 
[01:39:30]  I need something melodic, harmonic, something nice, something catchy.  Something.  Is it?  Should I go to you?  Yeah, this is more of what I want.  Okay.  Thank you.  This is what I listen to.  For a half an hour, this is what that crazy fucking nut taxi driver was playing.  There is a self-indulgence that happens with some of these bands.  I've got to be honest with you.  It's nice, though.  No.  All right.  Let's sit here for a half an hour, and you tell me it's still nice. 
[01:40:00]  I wish we had a meter to see how many listeners we have right now, and just flush them all  out with this one song.  Gone.  Gone.  Gone.  And the cab driver on the way home was another one.  He was nutty, too.  Like, I wouldn't stop yapping.  About what?  I don't remember.  I was drunk at the time.  Yeah, I don't remember.  I remember the ride there a lot.  I don't remember the drive home too well.  We took a cab home?  Dumps are good.  Now, back to the guitar. 
[01:40:30]  I don't mind this, actually.  I wish I was with you.  That's kind of that Allman Brothers feel.  A little Allman Brothers.  You like the Allman Brothers, though.  There's some blues influence in there.  Some Allman Brothers.  And there's some self-indulgence in there.  Oh, hell yeah.  Right.  We get it.  Jesus.  Lost Woman Live, 1971, Part 1.  And it's nine minutes long.  I hate the Part 1.  Part 1.  I hate the Part 1 of rock and roll music. 
[01:41:00]  I hate the Part 1.  It leaves you with so many unanswered questions.  Oh, I know.  You have to listen to Part 2.  You never go to Part 2.  Part 2, maybe you get an answer to why the guitar was playing for so long, annoying me.  Lazy fucks.  Name your song, Part 1.  Terrible.  Or that Genesis again.  Home by the Sea and second Home by the Sea.  You know that Joe Walsh song.  It had a snap through like three separate tracks on the 8-track when it came out.  All right. 
[01:41:30]  And you're on to something.  Look at Ziggy in Jersey.  Ziggy.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, good morning, boys.  How you doing?  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Oh, Fred.  Okay.  I went to Transaverian Orchestra last Saturday.  And Joe Walsh came out on the end of the concert.  He played three songs, which lasted longer than the whole goddamn time.  See?  That motherfucking...  No one's going to wrap up a song.  Turn to the band, nod, and go...  End the fucking song. 
[01:42:00]  Who came up with that classic?  I know.  All you have to do is look at your band and they go, okay.  And then sometimes you get the...  Did you see the other song?  Yes.  You're like, stop it.  It's the fake ending.  Fake ending.  And it's talking about the fake ending where you're like, okay, they wrap it up.  But then it's just, yeah, then also the guitar starts in again. 
[01:42:30]  We did that as a goof so many times with a good old rat gut.  And we used to call it pandemonium because it just turns into pandemonium.  And the song would end and we would annoyingly keep going for probably 12 minutes  and just annoy the living shit out of people.  The coke must have been good, huh?  Oh, it was great.  Of course.  By the way.  You don't abide away.  Aha!  I knew there was a abide away.  Hold on.  Yeah, here's the ABBA answer, impossibly. 
[01:43:00]  Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Hey.  Hi, Keith.  It's Keith from Mack and Salt Lake in Jersey.  Oh, hey, man.  What's up, buddy?  Yeah.  Back, I guess it was six or seven years ago, ABBA was offered $1 billion.  $250 million apiece.  Blow your nose!  That's what they turned down.  Can you email me, Keith?  Can I need your number again?  I have Mack questions.  Yeah, sure, Jim.  I love this guy.  He's a Mack expert.  Is he?  We Photoshop each other's cocks and make them look bigger. 
[01:43:30]  Do you have a cold?  Yeah, Keith, what's wrong with your...  Are you sure it's $250 million apiece?  Nasal.  Yeah, it was $1 billion.  But how do they get...  It's crazy.  How does the investor get his money back on that?  Make a billion and ten.  Imagine all that and you make ten dollars.  Ten smack-a-roodies.  That's a lot of stress to make ten dollars.  How are you, Bill?  No, come on.  We've got to get to the...  I really want to know more about this.  I bet that's on Snopes.  Jim, do you want me to use the other treats, you know?  No, the real Jim Norton at Gmail.  Oh, boy.  I'll see you later.  Goodbye, my love. 
[01:44:00]  That's not going to cause...  When will the real and then the name not be the real guy?  Right.  Like, when will that have to be the real, real, real, real, real?  And we're getting some people asking you personally music questions.  Let's go to Matt in Virginia.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, what do you think about Thorogood, man?  Like, that's blues music right there.  He was way too liberal for me, but, I mean, he was the first in the Supreme Court.  No, not the Supreme Court justice.  One bourbon, one peccasso, one beer.  How could you not?  That's blues influence there. 
[01:44:30]  There are pop blues songs.  Horrible songs.  How about a little bad to the bone?  I don't mind listening to, because I guess they were played a lot on the radio and kind  of grew on me and shit like that.  But I'm not...  I couldn't go to a Thorogood concert and sit there and be like, wow, this is great.  I'd hear the songs I knew, and then I'd leave.  I'm not going to sit again to some self-indulgent fucking blues guitar shit.  How about a little, who do you love?  Give me a little, who do you love?  No, it goes on to...  Yeah.  Who do you love? 
[01:45:00]  Who do you love?  I don't know who.  I'm starting a George Thorogood cover band.  I will be the lead singer.  Who wants that?  Hand jive.  Doing that crazy hand jive.  Oh, yeah.  There's the blues influence.  Now I want to have Sam Adams.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Is this the Sam Adams song?  Fuck.  See, they know good music.  I invented a special glass.  I don't know what it does.  You know, every year we call Sam Adams and go, are you ready to come back on board?  Never.  And I always get the same answer. 
[01:45:30]  I love you guys, but...  He's busy etching rings into the bottom of glasses so the bubbles come out.  I don't know what that glass is.  It looks fascinating.  He's insane.  I need one.  He was more insane than us.  Come on.  You like this ad?  Thorogood is awful.  Do you love...  Hate him.  Nah, don't like him.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Yeah, it's all right.  All right, let's try another one.  It's all right.  Ken in Montreal.  You know, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Jimi Hendrix, the White Stripes, anything?  White Stripes. 
[01:46:00]  I like White Stripes.  White Stripes are great.  But that's a different animal.  Fucking White Stripes you gotta love.  No, the White Stripes are all dirty blues.  Listen to Rag and Bone, any of the stuff from their early stuff or their later stuff.  Just stop.  Would you fucking stop?  It's different.  Why are you getting mad?  Of course, it's different.  You can look at any song.  What the fuck?  You can look at any song and say there's a blues influence in there somewhere, but it doesn't  make it a blues band.  White Stripes is not a blues band.  Yes, they fucking are.  Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I'm Rag and Bone.  Stevie Ray Vaughan blues.  Wouldn't you say White Stripes more of like a garage band? 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Something like that.  There's definitely some blues in there.  Absolutely.  You're full of turkey.  You certainly are, sir.  I'm only yelling at the listeners because I love them and they don't listen.  Yeah, why are you yelling at everybody?  Well, I'm not.  You really are a yelling kid.  Oh, and Ken, you also say Stevie Ray Vaughan, right?  What about Stevie Ray Vaughan?  He died way before his time in that helicopter crash.  No, Stevie Ray, I fucking can't stand that shit.  You want to hear a guy where every fucking song is the same, it's Stevie Ray Vaughan. 
[01:47:00]  Can I tell you something about Stevie Ray Vaughan when I was a music jock and I thought  I was cool?  I would intro Stevie Ray Vaughan records by calling him Stevie Ray Badass.  No, you wouldn't.  No, you wouldn't.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we'll see you after vacation.  You really wouldn't.  I am leaving and not coming back tomorrow.  No, you wouldn't.  I thought I was the coolest fucking jock out there.  I would intro Stevie Ray Vaughan as Stevie Ray Badass.  Wow.  On the home of rock and roll.  Stevie Ray Badass.  Give me a little couldn't stand the weather. 
[01:47:30]  Would I love to hear a tape of that?  I really wouldn't.  I couldn't listen to it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Sell this.  Well, I don't know how to do this anymore.  No, I really don't know how to.  Give it a Stevie Ray Badass.  Let me hear it.  I'm trying to remember some of my catchphrases.  You can't just say Stevie Ray Badass.  Ah, mother hucker.  Yeah.  Continuing our 40-minute music marathon.  Here's Stevie Ray Badass on the home of rock and roll.  Dude.  All right.  Look.  I got goosebumps. 
[01:48:00]  They're not the good ones you get from a good movie ending.  Know what the other one was?  Give me a little Blackwater by a little band called the Doobie Brothers.  Oh.  They got in trouble once for a...  Well, actually, somebody got in trouble for bootlegging one of their teams.  Yeah.  My friend, Fred Berry.  Yes.  Yes.  On a little tape.  Steven S. from Bayshore calling me Greg Opie Dumbass.  He remembers that I used to go by Greg Opie Hughes on the radio.  Right.  Because I thought that was cool, too.  I thought everything was cool. 
[01:48:30]  PD told you one or the other, my friend.  That's right.  Pick one or the other.  You're either Greg Hughes or you're Opie.  Which did you pick?  We're in the middle of a four-play weekend where the fourth cut is always live.  The fourth cut is always live.  Oh.  Oh, wait.  I forgot how this is going to be.  Oh.  They ain't related, but they do be brothers.  Saw the home of rock and roll.  That was a big one, too.  I forgot it was the last second, though.  I wanted to hit the phone.  No fucking way.  They ain't related, but they do be brothers. 
[01:49:00]  And you have high hopes if this thing falls apart.  I ain't going back to music, man.  That's terrible.  I got other things to do.  Are you kidding me?  That's terrible.  They do be brothers.  They do be brothers, yes.  Try to remember another one for you.  Wow.  Try to remember another one.  That's horrible.  The fuck was the other one?  I wouldn't even think that.  They ain't related, but they do be brothers.  That's pretty clever.  It's not a level it doesn't stick on. 
[01:49:30]  Someone's suggesting you go home with mope.  Let's say hi to Bonnie in D.C.  Bonnie.  Hey, guys.  I want to see if you'll play the Allman Brothers' Ramblin' Man.  It is the absolute most horrific sound in the history of rock.  The end of that with the music.  It's unlistenable.  Is it the studio version?  Either one of them, but I'm sure a lot of them will be more.  All right, let's try this.  Give me the last minute of Ramblin' Man, Travis, if you could. 
[01:50:00]  Travis, working today.  I like this.  If it would ever end.  If it would ever end.  You're right.  There are times when you listen to this stuff, you're like, okay, just end it right there.  Yeah.  No, right here.  I don't mind this.  It just fades out like this.  Like, when you're driving in your car and this is playing, you're just like, how long  do I have to wait until, like, maybe the next good song comes on?  One more minute.  I fucking love Ramblin' Man.  One minute of this.  It's a little long, but it's still good, though.  But it's the same riff over and over again. 
[01:50:30]  There's nothing else happening with this song.  It just fades out from here.  Shut up!  Well, the live cut I have in here is three minutes longer than the studio cut.  And it's all the end.  I've never been in to listen to this.  Good news, Ann.  We got George Thorogood trivia coming in from Stryker. 
[01:51:00]  Stryker?  Stryker!  What's up, Stryker?  Hey, about 12 years ago, Thorogood was invited to play at a concert out here in Colorado.  He wanted, I kid you not, and talk about thinking way too much of yourself.  It was a radio station that was putting on this charity event.  Thorogood wanted $500,000 to perform first-class plane tickets or a private jet for him, his van, and their equipment, as well as... 
[01:51:30]  It's Jimmy's standard deal.  It's a penthouse apartment.  Let me play this.  Penthouse suite.  And they were like, give us some reason why, and he goes, because that's what I demand.  And they got Skinner to come out and perform for $200,000 with no demand whatsoever.  Wow.  What, with a charity event?  Why was anybody asking for money if it's a charity event?  Well, it's, uh, Jimmy, you've done their show.  It's Lewis and Floor Wax on the Fox.  Oh, in Denver. 
[01:52:00]  I love those guys.  I like those guys a lot, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah, they have a, they have their own blues band, and every August...  I like Bill and Wood Soap better.  Every August.  What were you saying?  There was a blip in the system, but it's past, thank God.  We're back.  Yeah, the satellite went out.  Yeah, apparently the satellite hit a piece of shit in midair, and it's fine.  We just hit a sunspot, but we're back broadcasting.  What's the charity they do?  Jesus Christ. 
[01:52:30]  They just have a couple of charities that they do stuff for, and they have their own band that  performed, and they were doing this, and they were, you know, they'll usually get, like,  some big-name band to come out and be the headliner.  Wow.  And they were, they had, that's thorough good.  They were, you know, they'll put up, you know, plugs or, you know, feelers to all these  different bands to come out and do this, and even though it was a charity deal, we could  just put up 4%.  Wow, that's ridiculous. 
[01:53:00]  People are calling Bravo Sierra, by the way.  Why?  I don't know.  They just are.  Yeah, it seems like a pretty big...  I don't know what they're, uh...  Maybe that's what he gets.  He might want to have a million.  Who knows?  We got a very, very pissed off Stevie Ray badass fan.  Oh, shit.  Stevie Ray badass fan!  What's up, Chris?  Hey, how's it going?  Anthony, you gotta be fucking insane.  Yeah.  And...  I'm going to a movie theater at home.  I just, I just wanted to suggest this.  Yeah.  Get Stevie Ray Vaughan live at El Macombo in Toronto.  Yep.  One of the best live performances of a movie in your life. 
[01:53:30]  He's right.  You're right.  Excuse me.  Jimmy doesn't know.  I've seen that.  No, you haven't.  Did you say Stevie Ray Vaughan?  Stevie Ray Vaughan.  No, we don't know that guy.  It's Stevie Ray...  I can't say it.  No, you guys are a journey fan.  That's right.  That's right.  You're right, you guys are a journey fan.  Aw, damn.  Aw, damn, yo.  What's your favorite journey fan?  Sorry, I don't want to sit through the same fucking story.  Sounding, blues shit, self-indulgent crap.  Wow.  That's what it is, dude.  Stop. 
[01:54:00]  Listen to it.  Stevie Ray Vaughan.  Every song.  What's your band?  What's your music?  Ooh.  What's my music?  That's pretty hard.  That's pretty hard.  I'm going to get a ballad of the art.  Whose band is better?  Wow.  Wow, this is going to be a tough one.  Let's turn this around.  Sorry.  Name your favorite 70s band, Anthony.  70s band?  Let's go with the 70s.  I got to go back to the 70s.  Late 70s was a good time for music.  What did I like in the 70s?  Ballroom Blunt.  No, because see, oddly enough, I was probably into, you know, stupid Southern rock back then. 
[01:54:30]  But that doesn't really my taste.  What about the Allman Brothers?  My taste in music is, yeah, I like some Allman Brothers.  I don't like the self-indulgent crap.  And Stevie Ray Vaughan had only that.  Holy shit.  It was that crap.  I like that crap.  I like fucking, you know, Metallica, Alice in Chains, shit like that.  Okay.  In the 70s?  No, not from the 70s.  What?  All the same crap.  No, it isn't.  Stop it.  Yep.  Just stop it.  Well, not the same, but it's the same genre.  Right.  Of course.  No, it isn't.  All right.  I don't know.  You're not going to turn Anthony on that, but thanks, Chris.  Let's see how that.  Come on, it's just, you're going to get his stupid fucking obligatory long guitar lead. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah, because he's a guitar god, man.  Well, whatever.  He stayed a bit badass for a reason.  You don't like when they're called guitar gods?  No, I don't.  What was Clapton's nickname?  Was his nickname the guitar?  Clapton is God.  That was it.  Let's say hi to Sean and Aubrey.  Oh, boy, did I almost fire out a mean line.  Sean.  Hey, guys.  I have a couple quick things.  One, when I used to live outside Tampa, there was a local jock.  Window guards, McGillicuddy.  Go ahead, sir. 
[01:55:30]  Sean, go ahead.  Yeah.  There used to be a local jock that would always say, John Cougar badass.  John Cougar badass?  No, he was never.  My dad used to love a full version of, you've really got me now,  and I stopped taking car trips with him.  What else did your dad like?  Glory holes? 
[01:56:00]  Pucked that one.  All right.  Glory holes and Harvey Milk?  It's just meanness.  Just kidding.  On this show.  No, I'm not.  What's the sound again?  I love it.  It's meanness.  Yeah, that's the sound.  The universal sound of, you know.  I wish I had that one sound.  I wish I had that one sound.  Oh, that's terrible. 
[01:56:30]  Hey, Carrot Peeler's going after ACDC.  Now, come on.  Really?  He says it's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll.  Enough with the fucking bagpipes.  Too many bagpipes in that song. 
[01:57:00]  Bagpipes?  You like the ACDC, right?  Yeah, I like ACDC.  There's some, you know, some I like, some I don't like.  Thunderstruck?  Yeah, Thunderstruck's good.  I like that, too.  Powerful shit.  That's good stuff.  Fucking one of the greatest live songs ever.  Thunderstruck.  Anytime a band, and it's usually like a cover band,  does things like Stevie Ray Vaughan and stuff.  Anytime I got a band where the guitarist is going off,  and like someone's in the audience,  one guy standing right by the stage with a mullet, 
[01:57:30]  and his head's back, and his eyes are shut,  and he's sweating too much with the beer in his hand.  Like, that means it's shit.  And they could be doing it to a T.  They could be playing it perfectly.  Can we all agree we hate Yngwie Malmsteen?  And then we can end this discussion.  Yngwie.  Are you a fan of those guitar guys that don't really have any fucking singing?  They don't have a band or anything, no singing.  You want to talk about self-indulgence.  Cliffs of Dover, man.  Let me hear some Cliffs of Dover.  All right, give me a little Cliffs of Dover.  Let's hear some Cliffs of Dover. 
[01:58:00]  And this was like as popular as a song like this will get.  Who sings this?  No one.  No one sings it.  Is it Eric Johnson?  Eric Johnson, very good, Travis.  But then again, you've got the master computer in front of you.  What do you think of this?  What do you think of this?  Here we go.  This is cool if it's 30 seconds in the middle of a good song.  All right, you can play.  We get you.  How fast can you get those fingers going? 
[01:58:30]  I need to know.  Did you sing thing?  Oh, no, this is Eric Johnson.  Eric Johnson.  Cliffs of Dover.  We just have to play this on the radio.  Yeah, yeah, this actually got airplay and...  All right, okay.  All right, this is all right.  Yeah.  But this is like the only type of song I think that'll get popular like this.  Right.  It's not like he's got five.  It's not like he has five of these.  He has one.  You know why?  It's very happy.  It's peppy.  I'm bursting with love.  It's just one of these. 
[01:59:00]  What's happening to our ho-ho-hoey Christmas?  It's very Gary Hoey-ish.  Where's our Gary Hoey Christmas?  Well, I guess we don't have it.  Can we do a little grinch into a break?  We've got to give out the email address, dude, so people can get tickets for tomorrow.  For what tomorrow?  What are we doing tomorrow?  See, it's got this part, which is like almost the chorus.  That's why it was popular.  Yeah.  Hey, I mean, it's a good song.  Yeah, I don't mind this one.  I'm not going to buy this shit, though.  There are very limited tickets for tomorrow.  What? 
[01:59:30]  For what?  For our talent show.  But it'll be fun.  We'll make it fun.  Do we have talent?  No.  Did you talk to Keith?  Do we even have talent?  Do we have talent?  Do we have anything for tomorrow?  Wow, that's a good, uh, let me, let me, let me, um.  I'm sure he'll round up a few.  Let me text the old Keithy.  We'll make, we'll make, uh, something out of the shit that is presented to us tomorrow.  No problem.  Steve Vai, Ant.  What about Steve Vai?  Steve Vai.  I don't know.  It's another one of those guys, but.  All right.  He was, eh. 
[02:00:00]  They're calling you a Duran Duran fag, Anthony.  Uh, Duran Duran was cutting edge, uh, very, uh, harmonic, um, cutting edge band of the  time.  I'm not a, you know.  Do you like Duran Duran?  No, but they were, they were like the wolf.  No, no, no, no.  Hungry like the wolf.  No.  I'm just saying they were very influential for the time.  It's, it's all fucking dated shit.  Try this one with the live track. 
[02:00:30]  Why would you go live when they're based on, he always goes live.  He does.  I've been very good today.  Uh, why would he go live?  He's an idiot.  You don't go live with this song.  Why, Travis?  We're talking to the, I apologize.  We're talking to our old school MTV fans here right now.  You're not an idiot.  You're a father and a husband.  You don't live version of this.  You don't live it.  Why?  I'm taking back those Canadian tickets.  Fuck you.  No.  Oh, God.  Go fuck yourself.  Buy your own fucking tickets.  Well, let's give him a shot.  Why, Queer?  I love Traps.  Uh, because.  His kid robot shirt should have a fucking shotgun shell in the middle of the time. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah, that wasn't.  Uh, because in the search box, I, I can't see the entire box.  So, sometimes, you know.  All excuses, excuses, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Yeah, because they didn't really know how to play live.  It worked perfectly.  What?  Most of this shit's on a machine.  What?  So, we're doing a live show for what?  10 people tomorrow or something?  The capacity's small, but it's going to be like 24 people.  Yeah, they could have fucking expanded it, but these guys are used to just taking no for  an answer.  Here's what we do.  Stop taking no for an answer and push, push, push. 
[02:01:30]  Push until people are annoyed.  As much as you're annoyed by us, you should make other people annoyed.  That's how this thing works.  Oh, my God.  So, when they go, no, they can't have a live broadcast with more than 24 people, you start  asking questions.  Why?  Why not?  Why can't we work something out?  Really annoy the fuck out of them how you're annoyed at us.  Well, I want to find out, Gary, why we can't do a few more, but.  We can't even have standby people, because he took a no as an answer.  I don't like the fact that this.  Well, I want to work on this, but I don't like the fact that there's only 12 winners  with one guest.  What are you doing? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Why would you make that decision instead of letting us, the show, make the decision?  We don't need other people to do our fucking gig.  And why would there be a problem if there's a lot of people here tomorrow?  Who cares?  They do it for other shows.  This is supposed to be fun.  It doesn't need to be so controlled all the time.  I'll give you the email address, but here's what you have to put in it.  And it is important, just so you can get contacted.  You include Opie and Anthony in the subject line of your message, or it will not be considered,  because they get a lot of emails.  So please put Opie and Anthony in, the subject heading.  Include your full name and your cell number. 
[02:02:30]  It's extremely important.  You have to have the name that's on your ID and your cell number so they can call you.  Um, and they put that they're not going to provide transportation.  No shit.  What is the one?  You have to be 21 years old.  Okay.  Anything else, Danny, below that?  Okay.  If you're 21 years old and you don't need, and you didn't think the Sirius XM jet was flying  you in.  Jimmy's a soldier, man.  I want Ted Danson.  I care about our show.  You're a fucking soldier.  I care about this show no matter what. 
[02:03:00]  No matter fucking what.  I already told those guys that.  Include your full name and cell phone number and Opie and Anthony in the subject line.  This is for 12 people, by the way.  And make sure you can fucking be here.  Yeah, make sure you can be here.  I'm going to fight for a few more.  Because we're not allowed to have extras.  So if you're not here, then all of a sudden the show we're doing for 12 listeners and  their guests go down to like 11, 10, 9, 8.  Yeah, kick your ass.  Here's the email address.  Wow, it's going to sound crazy tomorrow on the radio with 24 people.  RSVP at SiriusXM.com.  That's RSVP at SiriusXM.com. 
[02:03:30]  All right, don't bother doing it now because it's full.  I don't know.  I say people should fucking email.  Really?  Yes.  RSVP at SiriusXM.com.  It's our first audience event in a year.  We got to fucking start somewhere.  It's the first one in a year.  It's not an audience event.  We have 20 people checking out the show on a regular basis.  Sometimes at XM we don't have small crowds.  I'm not acknowledging that this is an actual audience event.  All right, well, I'll call it that. 
[02:04:00]  Email.  We're just doing the right thing and that's it, that.  We want to do something with the listeners.  Our backs are against the wall at this fucking whole shopping spree.  You know the deal.  It ain't our fucking fault.  This is the deal.  It's the best we could do.  We want to do something.  We could just do a show, but who gives us?  You want to do something different?  I think having any type of live audience.  The most we've had is like sometimes we get to bring our friends in and they sit down on the couch.  I love an audience.  I miss having a live audience.  It was always fun to go around the audience and go, you know, what do you do? 
[02:04:30]  What the fuck are you with him for?  What are you with her for?  She's a pig.  This one's fat.  That's great.  If you notice that one nice thing, not one welcome to the show, not one hey thanks,  why are you with him and who's fat?  Exactly.  Exactly.  RSVP at SiriusSM.com.  It's Channel 5 showing the punch once, twice, three times, four times.  Holy shit.  There's so many.  Five times. 
[02:05:00]  There's so six.  There's more than this.  Seven.  They probably showed it 12 times.  Seven fucking, yeah, and that's when I first looked up.  How, and now he's probably outraged.  Yeah, what's the difference?  You're showing the clip, which would bother people.  So, so just could you say something clever after the clip means it's okay to play the  clip?  Unbelievable.  If you're so pissed at MTV, then you shouldn't be showing the clip either.  By the way, Fox.  It's all horse shit.  Fox, you know, who I love, but I believe owned by the same parent company as the New York  Post. 
[02:05:30]  Oh!  Where's Linda Stacey's outrage?  Oh!  You know, and I'm not faulting them.  I don't even fault Rupert Murdoch or anybody at the News Corp.  I fault Linda Stacey for being fucking phony.  Yeah.  They're fine.  Play it.  You should play it.  She is a phony.  She is a phony.  Go ahead.  Go after it.  Fake outrage.  Exactly.  Go after the news.  Go after Fox News.  And why is John Stossel talking about this?  Because he has a fucking, a gay porno mustache in this day and age.  How do you not love a man with a mustache as thick as, if I may, a donkey cock? 
[02:06:00]  Why am I screaming?  He does have a thick mustache.  You can't show the clip eight times on TV if you're outraged as a media outlet.  No.  It doesn't make sense.  Oh, brother.  We got some ho-ho-ho-y to go into break.  Ho-ho-ho-y.  Listen to some ho-ho-ho-y.  And the Homeless Talent Show is tomorrow.  We have a good four hours in that fucking room.  Well, a good, probably two.  The other two will probably be a media outlet.  Let me, aside with Anthony, we have a good two hours. 
[02:06:30]  We have one, we have a good 40 minutes.  An average 120, an hour of filler, and an hour of dreck.  Just horrible, despicable stuff.  Can you check to see how many home sick days I got left?  Okay.  You should come in tomorrow.  Oh, no.  My throat's a little scratchy.  Why would Sam know your sick days?  He's going to go down the hall and find out for me.  They're not going to tell him anything.  Sam, take the temperature of the old passion away here.  I've got to make sure I'm not going to get fired if I take a sick day tomorrow.  Where's Gary?  Is he sleeping in his morgue from Ork Bed? 
[02:07:00]  Fucking weird guy he is.  That little head.  He should drive an egg car.  He should drive an egg car.  That fucking made me laugh yesterday.  Uh-oh.  Swine flu.  Wow.  That's one and one.  Fucking achy, man.  Oh, no.  It's coming on fast.  I've got the chills.  Let's do some ho-ho-ho-y.  When we get back, we're going to play the D-Boy production. 
[02:07:30]  A visit from St. Nick, narrated by Big A and Stalker Patty.  Oh, this better be good, since he insulted my fucking Call of Duty play.  He's right outside the door.  Who is?  St. Nick?  He's early!  Give him a mic.  Give him a mic.  I don't want to talk to any of these guys.  He's early!  I don't want to talk to any of these guys off of it.  Oh, here's fucking his awful hat.  Yeah.  Sam's feet.  Sam's feet are almost backwards. 
[02:08:00]  I bet you if you put Sam's feet straight, he would just shit his pants.  It would be like hedge clippers.  His asshole would open up.  He prefers not to talk on the air.  He just wanted to give you the update, because Steve and me spoke to him.  I don't need an update.  What's the update?  I'd like one.  Ask him what the update is, and then tell us.  Ask him.  I already just turned it down.  What's the update?  We can't...  We have to confine the entire show to the fishbowl.  That's the concession that was made.  The fishbowl...  The audio will not be broadcast, obviously. 
[02:08:30]  I understand that.  And the visual portion will be...  Nobody's going to be able to see it.  Why is that?  They're putting banners and stuff up around the fishbowl, so people can't see what's going  on in the fishbowl.  Why, though?  There's going to be no nudity.  Oh, it doesn't matter.  Because he said that way, just in case anything happens, he doesn't want to, you know, hold  back the show.  Here's what it is.  We are a horrible, despicable show that should not be the showcase show that day that is  in their lobby.  Yeah.  Doing a show. 
[02:09:00]  So, if people come in and go, ew, it's Opie and Anthony, this place sucks.  And then they'd run out.  And they'd lose like business.  Why...  That really does annoy me.  I mean, why...  Why can't we have...  And they've done it for other shows.  They were going to do the same thing for the sweater fashion show, right?  Block off the whole thing?  No, they would have...  And not have it played out.  With the trumpeteers?  They would have not done that.  They generally don't block it off.  They never block it off.  Because the homeless are so unpredictable, they are blocking it off.  That's what they've said.  Because they cannot predict if the homeless are going to take their pants off or whatever. 
[02:09:30]  How about this?  They're not going to...  You can't predict that in the fucking...  In the street.  That's idiotic.  You walk down the street, they have their pants off.  There you go, Jimmy.  Go ahead, Jimmy.  I just get annoyed because other shows have been allowed to have their people outside.  And I don't know why...  I understand why they can't play the audio.  It's an XL channel, language.  I don't want to show handcuff tomorrow.  I do get that.  Yeah.  But why can't, if somebody brings their own Sirius unit, their own XM portable, they sit 
[02:10:00]  out and watch us through the glass?  Why the fuck not?  He said because when they do shows that people sit outside for, it's never for more than an  hour.  Honestly, it's never for more than an hour or two.  So what?  So two more hours is making the difference?  Yeah, who cares?  It's a hassle.  What does the time have to do with it?  What's that got to do with anything?  Because they said they don't want to have to have to worry about a bunch of fans sitting  out in the lobby for four hours.  Between six and ten.  They have to get extra security. 
[02:10:30]  So why not get one extra guy?  They don't mind worrying for an hour and a half or two hours.  But that extra two hours has the whole company panicking?  I don't get it.  And they say that there is no justifiable reason because they won't be able to see or  hear without the unit.  We've given the justifiable reason.  Stop with the blocking everything off.  Nothing bad's going to happen.  We're just trying to build excitement.  That's all.  How about this?  You block off...  It's called building excitement.  You block off three...  Creating a buzz, right, Ant?  Remember that?  Sure, I remember.  You block off two sides of it.  And then the one side that's open, the fucking fans can look in. 
[02:11:00]  Like a peep show.  How about this?  If you're so barricade obsessed, how about you fucking allow extra fans to sit on one side  of the glass and you put barricades behind those fans?  Oh, like an extended area.  Yeah, how about that?  Why can't we do that?  Behind the stage seating.  Yeah, why can't we do that?  And this way, you can allow them to have their own portable units because plenty of people  have portable units.  Why are you yelling, man?  I don't know.  It's never going to happen.  But no, why not?  That makes perfect sense.  But that's why.  The bottom line is the company has said... 
[02:11:30]  And that's the bottom line!  Yes.  They said the company, not one specific person, they said everybody in general is in agreement  that...  The building spoke.  It's not like there's no...  Keep the door open.  Keep the door open.  There's no lobby.  Accent.  Just shove a mic out the door.  That'd be funny.  Get that out of here.  No, do it.  There's a concern that there's enough other business, a hundred however many radio stations,  the corporate folks upstairs, the lobby service at all. 
[02:12:00]  So?  I don't mean to have to be callous, but so are the homeless people.  There's enough unpredictability about the show, and for people to sit in the lobby...  Now we're going to get in trouble with it.  This is the last time I ever pushed from the gun.  I'm just going to make that gun.  I'm really bummed to do that.  This is why I push it.  This is why I push it.  It's so silly.  It's so silly.  Listen, I understand the frustration, but wait, wait, wait, wait.  I'm not knowing you.  I know you're just doing to the messenger.  Twenty-four people is not sufficient.  It's not sufficient because people have to go to work.  I heard the letterman example.  That's not accurate because one hour at 5 p.m. is different than four hours from work. 
[02:12:30]  Let us work.  Listen, is somebody recording this?  I don't know.  So anyway, like I was saying...  And then the other part of it is, like, ridiculous.  But, I mean, you know.  I couldn't even come up with anything.  I know.  All right, let's go to break.  I was so into it listening that I couldn't even cover it up with anything.  I tried, though, man.  Why don't we go to break with some ho-ho-ho-y? 
[02:13:00]  Ah, that'll get us in the Christmas spirit.  Yeah.  Fuck you and fuck Santa.  Hit the fucking song.  How great is that picture? 
[02:13:30]  What do you mean it's nice?  It's a white girl's ass, Danny.  Nothing wrong with a white girl's ass.  It doesn't have as much juice, but there's some shit going on right there.  You can see the vagina, like, underneath, so it's fun from the back.  We're on the air.  Opie and Anthony, back with the program.  Jimmy smoothed everything over.  Everything is good.  You actually...  Here's part of the problem.  You can easily get more than 24 people in the Eurot. 
[02:14:00]  I do.  It's as big as our old studio, and we used to have 100 people in there.  You could do 45 people, because we're going to have a little stage on our tables.  The piano will be out.  You could do comfortably.  You don't need chairs.  Well, even with chairs, you could do 40 people.  But you don't need them.  All right, you put a few chairs down and have a standing room in the back.  Have 25 chairs.  Yeah, I want to hear what the...  One of the problems is this.  We're losing at least a foot all the way around because of those dumb signs they're insisting 
[02:14:30]  on putting up.  So that's really annoying.  We can't play the audio.  No one can see it.  You're eating up room.  If they have things that stick to the window or hang from the window, that's one thing.  But if it's those stupid freestanding signs, we're losing room.  Why can't they put those on the outside of the glass?  Why?  Because that would make sense.  They don't want it to look like, what, a fucking radio company?  It's what it is.  What corporate people are coming in the Friday before Christmas that will be offended by a 
[02:15:00]  bunch of serious signs?  God almighty.  We're just trying to create a little buzz for our show.  No, why would you?  And if there's more people in what they like to call the fishbowl, it sounds even more  exciting on the air.  Exactly.  It's a radio 101 show.  It's a live event thing right here at the studio.  It's something that is the backbone of broadcasting and stuff.  I don't understand why it's been this much of an issue just to get this thing rolling. 
[02:15:30]  I do.  I know exactly why.  We all know why.  We really do.  Our paranoia is not paranoia.  We all know why.  I openly admitted that my emotions are horrendous.  I personally cannot face these guys physically because I'm out of my mind.  I'm so frustrated and pissed off about how this whole thing was handled to the point I  cannot even sit down and talk like a human being like Jimmy can.  You can and certainly can.  I can't even see these guys until after break. 
[02:16:00]  It's business.  I can't see, but that's where my problem is and I'm finally admitting it to the world.  Most of the faithful listeners already know that.  I physically cannot talk to any of these guys anytime soon because I'm out of my fucking  mind and I know I'll say stupid shit.  Last year around this time, I was so frustrated by the company.  I actually walked off a show and I got a talking to that if I do that again, I'm fired.  I have to handle my emotions in such a way where I can't even look or talk to these people 
[02:16:30]  anytime soon.  That is my problem.  That is my issue that I got to try to fucking figure out.  With that said, I could just talk for myself.  I've been doing radio since 18.  I've never seen a promotion handled as bad as this homeless shopping spree thing has  been handled.  It is amazing to me.  I can't even think of something that comes even close to how horrendous this was handled  from everyone's point of view.  There's a lot of excuses flying around and stuff.  It's just bullshit.  It should have never came to this. 
[02:17:00]  We were surprised that we were even doing the homeless shopping spree when they came to  us and said, yeah, good news because we forgot about it.  We're like, you know what?  Wow, we're doing that?  Then we got excited like, okay, I think we can get something together in three weeks.  That's just not how it works in radio.  It has never worked that way in my entire career.  It was a clusterfuck, which scares me, which really scares me if the right people are handling  this channel, to be completely honest with you, because it should have never gotten to  the point it got to. 
[02:17:30]  If the lawyers were having problems with this from the beginning, we should have, as a channel,  said, you know what?  Oh, well, let's just move on.  But they pushed, pushed, pushed, and then said, look, you guys, good news.  You can do it in three weeks.  Like, wow, okay.  And Ann and I, off air, were discussing it, going, I said to Ann, and he completely agreed.  I go, this thing is never happening.  You know that, right?  And Ann said, yeah.  I knew it wasn't going to be pulled off.  Because it was just handled so poorly.  Here's what I don't like about the whole situation, too. 
[02:18:00]  It's, it's, I don't want the perception that, and it's funny to say this after everything  that's happened, that we are the difficult people to work with.  We're pretty easy to work with if, if people are willing to, to work with us.  We're willing to work with them.  This was something that, like, you know, no matter how much we said what, what we absolutely  need to get this done, it just wouldn't happen.  Wait.  So it was frustrating as hell. 
[02:18:30]  But God bless you, too, because I said, you know, no, let's just do a fucking show and  get out of here for the two weeks.  You guys are like, no, let's try to do the right thing and try to take care of the situation  at hand.  And I respect that, to be honest with you.  And then, then I'm on board.  And then every step of the way from agreeing to do something to make up for the homeless  shopping spree has been a nightmare.  Like, it's like, where does it end?  This is this.  Where does it fucking end?  24 fucking people for a broadcast is lame.  But we will do it and we will do great radio because that's what we do. 
[02:19:00]  They have, I'm sorry, they have beaten, I'm telling you, to make, we're not difficult.  I am a fucking, a whore for promoting, for real.  From the day when I was doing Last Comic Standing and I found out that the show had signed with  XM and I'm like, why don't you send me XM shirts, I'll wear them on.  Yeah.  I am a fucking whore.  And congratulations to the guys that work here.  You have taken somebody who was so fucking excited to be here and to be, when the merger 
[02:19:30]  was happening, I was happy about it.  When we were losing terrestrial radio, I was happy about it because I hated working for  those people at CBS.  Not that I hated them.  I didn't like the environment.  And congratulations to the people here.  You have taken somebody who was a soldier who would have fucking whored your company name  everywhere.  And you have made me feel like a dummy forever fucking enjoying myself in this place.  I love you guys and I love doing the show and I'm going to continue to do the show and 
[02:20:00]  I'm not going to fucking mail it in because I'm creative and I love to do this.  But, and I know, I apologize to the listeners who are, what's that?  It's not what I read on the message.  Well, I actually wrote it.  Uh, you know, I know the listeners get sick of hearing this, but if you only knew what  a gung-ho, dumb motherfucker I was about promoting this.  There's no place I ever went where it wasn't promote.  I go on terrestrial radio to promote gigs always.  Does that mean no more Jay Leno plugs? 
[02:20:30]  I've, I've had them pulled and I don't give a fuck if it's in my contract or if they fire  me for it.  I really don't.  I really don't care.  But we like hearing her.  I love you guys, but the bottom line is that was 12 million people last week.  That would have heard it.  That's pretty good marketing.  I don't care if they mad at me and I don't care if they fucking fire me.  I really don't.  I'm at that point.  You had a guy who was a fucking whore and you have completely turned me around.  I don't know.  I've never had that happen in my career.  It's amazing.  There's a lot of mediocre channels and shows here and we're a very passionate show and 
[02:21:00]  a very passionate channel and wow, just want the people around us to understand that and  push, push, push.  I have my books plugged from now on because those are the things that pay me.  They pay me to do a book, what I make here.  And that's what I make for a book.  I guess we got to be embarrassed to be Opie and Anthony because it's like, you're not  even going to be able to see into the fishbowl because God, who knows what's going to happen  with those guys and their radio show inside the fishbowl.  It really is like just demeaning. 
[02:21:30]  I'm sorry to listen to the bellyache here and like just go, oh God, we, we just are  the dregs of society.  Dude, that's why there's no Opie and Anthony sign.  That's why there's, you have to beg for every mention and that's why the channel is not  called Opie and Anthony.  We, it's like, I'm not being paranoid.  I've dealt with other networks.  I've dealt with when people like, like my man, Jonathan always says, dude, Comedy Central  loves you.  I'm like, John, they don't.  If they loved me, they would use me for something other than only when Saget asks for me. 
[02:22:00]  Yeah.  And then he finally, he finally came around and John's a positive guy and he goes, you're  right.  We'll never pitch them again.  And I don't, I don't even dislike Comedy Central.  I respect their opinion.  Okay.  They feel that way.  It's okay.  And they're frustrated by this happening day, day in and day out.  But the problem is we were, we were in a good place with the show and everything.  And the incompetence of this homeless shopping spree really has just thrown us into a fucking  tizzy.  Tizzy.  You guys did this.  Not us.  You guys did this.  The incompetence of the homeless shopping spree and how it was handled and, and, and, and 
[02:22:30]  that not happening today is just mind boggling.  But if instead of looking at it, like we're being difficult, kind of look at it like, wow,  okay, these guys have kind of done this before.  They know how certain things work.  Let's see if we can make it work.  There's no reason.  See, the, the best thing would be to have the most people we can possibly have at a live  event in the building.  It's exciting.  It's, you know, shit's going on. 
[02:23:00]  Why limit it and, and, and without even a good reason, there's these stupid legal feeling  touchy feely reasons.  I don't know what the reason, if they said, if someone said, look, the floor cannot physically  handle more people than such and such.  And with our audience, it could quite possibly be the truth.  It could max out at four people.  Who, who, who decided that the number is a safe number is 24.  Exactly.  Well, they're losing a foot of room around the, this is what annoys me. 
[02:23:30]  They're losing a foot of room around the entire inside of the fishbowl because of the signs  they're putting.  Uh, and look, I talked to Gary, I understood what he said to me was this, and again, I  liked him and I liked Rob.  They, they guys are just messengers, man.  They just, they're trying to help.  It's not, they're not bad guys.  But Gary said to me, look, we're having a bunch of, because you guys are an edgy show.  It's not Martha or Oprah.  We're, we're having a bunch of, uh, uh, your fans in here and homeless people who have  not been vetted by us.  We don't know if they're going to do anything. 
[02:24:00]  It's a corporate.  And I'm like, all right, I can live with that explanation.  I just don't like the fact they won't put the signs outside the studio.  The studio.  Are you going to have Opie and Anthony signs telling people what's going on inside?  So at least it looks, it looks like there's this edgy thing going on inside.  And you could put, let's say 40 people.  I mean, it's like you could do that.  How does that look to us to just be hidden?  Like we're in the middle of the lobby and they have to go to such lengths to hide the  fact that we're doing something in there.  How does it look? 
[02:24:30]  And live and it looks accurate.  It looks, it looks like what we know to be the case.  Yeah.  I've never worked with people and felt so fucking unwelcome.  And I know I sound like a belly acher, but it's really a frustrating thing.  You know what is even worse?  Mars, I know you're of a Puerto Rican descent.  Am I, am I, why is a Puerto Rican channel on, on the TV?  I have three TVs I could look at.  You know how I knew it was?  Which one do you think it is, Mars?  Yeah.  The two big bosomed girls holding a soccer ball. 
[02:25:00]  And dancing and running in place.  Yeah.  And it was the guy with the mullet on the morning show.  He had a fucking rat tail.  Exactly.  I don't know how that got changed.  A Yacy Penny.  There's a commercial for the Yacy Penny.  That's more entertaining to look at than English TV, though.  I'll say that.  They love their chicks with big tits jumping around for no reason.  Satin shorts.  The news has that.  They don't give a shit.  Nuevo.  And titties.  I don't know what's tits.  All right, listen, why don't we, let's move on. 
[02:25:30]  Hey, so Tiger Woods was named Athlete of the Decade.  What a guy.  We got people reacting to that news.  Oh, good.  Oh, no.  Hopefully, we'll get the stupid bitches.  Yeah.  Is that in there?  Stupid bitches.  I don't think that.  Good.  Good.  Good.  I really hope.  Good.  Let's hear it.  I hope that's in there.  Then do we get a guy that goes, doesn't really matter to me, you know, the guy, he's a good  golfer.  I don't care.  His personal life's his own. 
[02:26:00]  Is that it?  Because I swear on my family, I've never heard this.  Yeah, personal life and what he does in the sports world are two completely different things.  I hope people understand that.  I think it's disgusting and terrible what he's done to his wife.  He's a married man.  I can't wait.  Athlete of the year.  Athlete of the decade.  It's athletics in regard to Tiger, in my opinion.  So, for that award, yeah, that's fitting.  Probably before Thanksgiving Day, I would have said yes.  Now, I would, as a woman, I would say no. 
[02:26:30]  Shut up!  Exactly.  You old hag!  I'm going to put you down the stairs in a wheelchair.  Oh, so do I.  Tied up with electrical cord.  You know what we do to news people?  Whatever you are, man on the street.  Women shouldn't be allowed to watch sports.  News people?  I don't know.  I'm fucking 41.  That's the best I could come up with.  No, you're a little upset.  No wonder the company doesn't value me.  Newsperson head.  Zilch.  You are a little upset, though.  I'm a fucking mediocre talent.  I'm Jimmy Rolls. 
[02:27:00]  Dr. Steve?  As a woman, I would say no.  Not because of his athletic ability, but what he's done in his personal life.  But that shouldn't matter at all.  Exactly.  Athletes are terrible people.  Exactly.  But we like watching them at a particular sport.  Is he good at what he does?  I don't give a shit.  What do my athletes do when they're not on the field? 
[02:27:30]  Is Tiger a good golfer, Obi?  Amazing.  Is he considered a good golfer?  Good.  It's good.  Then, yes, athlete.  An amazing athlete.  He cares what he does.  And easily the athlete of the decade.  I don't even know who would be a close second.  He cares who likes fucking women.  Who came in second?  Do we know?  What a creep.  Wow.  Yeah.  Who came in second?  I don't know.  Oh.  Personal life.  Yes, you know why?  Because when he gets on the field, he performs.  Thank you, sir.  So anything happens besides that, that's outside of the business.  Thank you, sir.  Just like steroids and everything else. 
[02:28:00]  Tiger does deserve it.  Not at this point.  Sorry to say.  Why?  But you can't take away what he has accomplished, though.  You can't deny what he has accomplished for minorities as well as everyone else.  You can't do it.  Minorities, really?  Minorities.  Didn't bang one black broad.  Yeah.  Not a one.  Minorities.  In a way, I agree with that, though, because it is typically a very, very white sport and  considered unattainable to, exactly, and considered kind of an unattainable goal to black. 
[02:28:30]  Not even close to just the white sport anymore.  But it's still considered a sport of the elite.  Oh, yeah.  Well, it's more of a rich versus poor sport than black versus white at this point.  Yes.  And you've got to take the morality out of sports.  I don't give a shit, man.  I'm all for steroids and whatever the fuck they want to do.  I don't care.  Right?  Exactly.  Don't you want big monsters just playing your favorite sport?  Yes.  Yes. 
[02:29:00]  Sorry, I'm just looking.  There seems to be two people walking up my driveway.  I don't recognize them.  Are they goose-stepping?  Are you kidding?  No.  I'm looking at it right now.  I'm panning, panning, panning.  They're going next to my house.  Get out of here.  Let me see.  Let me go to camera two.  Do they have fucking white coats?  No.  The camera two here.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Right there.  Who are these guys?  They're going through my fence?  Okay.  Let me go to camera. 
[02:29:30]  Let me go here.  This is great.  Hold on.  Let me go here.  You know who it is?  It's the fucking Diaz brothers.  The Diaz brothers.  Oh, shit.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I've got to track this guy.  I've got to track this guy.  Hold on.  Hold on.  He's in your backyard?  Who's this guy?  Who the hell is this guy?  Are you serious, Ant?  Look.  He's very serious.  I think he knows who they are.  No.  You don't?  Oh, it's the alarm guy.  It's great.  Jesus.  All right.  Scared me. 
[02:30:00]  Dude, that is fucking fantastic.  Oh, jeez.  I was just checking, and lo and behold, there he is.  By the way, if this footage for that last time I was over, it looks like I'm smelling your  seat.  I had just dropped something.  Look at these guys.  I was just watching them.  Dude, that is fucking great.  They look like hoodlums.  I know.  They were wearing hoodies, so it's scary.  Hoodies and hats pulled down low.  Can I say something and I mean this?  It's fucking fun to be Anthony. 
[02:30:30]  I want to be Anthony.  It is fun to be Anthony.  It is kind of fun just tracking people at my house.  Don't fuck with me.  Yeah.  Give them the fucking keys.  That's fun.  I like that system.  Jesus Christ.  All right.  I'm like a lunatic.  Yes, you are.  Not like one, actually.  Let's get back to the Tiger Woods.  You can't do it.  I mean, actually, I do think he's athlete of the decade.  I mean, I think his recent problems over the last 10 years will eventually kind of quiet 
[02:31:00]  down, but I mean, yeah, it's a huge embarrassment for him now, but I mean, I think he is a great  athlete.  I just think he's human like the rest of us.  I think it's bad timing.  I think it's incredibly bad timing.  I mean, I think, you know, six months ago, we would have all agreed he was athlete of  the decade.  I think now everybody would look at it and go, oh, that's a bad choice.  How is that a bad choice?  I still want to look at his whole sort of body of work in context of how he's done over  the last 10 years.  And I do think he's one of the greatest athletes we've seen. 
[02:31:30]  I just think in the last few weeks, we found out the guy's got flaws like the rest of us  and bad timing is what I would call it.  Okay, fuck it.  What's next?  Fuck the asshole.  Exactly.  He's not husband.  That's two different things.  Hey, uh.  Right below fucking Klaus von Bülow in the husband's apartment.  Klaus von Bülow.  Howie in Canada says Lance Armstrong finished second.  Are you dead?  What did he do in the decade?  Fucking took his one ball and tucked it in while his fucking, his saggy left part of the 
[02:32:00]  bag hung over the seat stupidly.  Like melted taffy.  His one ball and his saggy melted bag.  Are you saying he wasn't balanced on his bicycle?  Not at all.  He kept going in circles.  Tour de France, uh, Tour de France, um, that was, was, was that all in the 2000s?  Yeah, he won it six times.  Six out of ten?  What a bum.  All right, I'm sorry.  Wow, yeah, that is, all right.  And he took, like, a year off.  Holy shit, I didn't know he won it that many times.  Wow, okay.  I stand corrected.  Uh, number three, Roger Federer.  Roger Federer.  Who's that?  Tennis guy, man.  Tennis God. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Uh, then who else we got?  What about Derek Jeter?  Fuck Derek Jeter.  Fuck Derek Jeter.  I just lost my list.  Phelps, yeah, that's good.  Oh, uh, Phelps fourth.  Eh.  He did good for two weeks in the decade, right?  Nah, but he's done more than that.  It's going to be funny.  He's climbing a ladder to the camera that I'm working right now.  Look, look at his face.  He's right there.  He's looking right at him.  Hold on.  Wait until he sees it move.  He's going to lose his...  You're going to knock him off the ladder. 
[02:33:00]  He's looking right at it.  I'm probably wondering why the camera's moving.  Look at this tool.  He's probably going, why is it moving?  Is he texting me?  Zoom in on his ball bag.  I'm really freaking out.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  That's creepy.  He goes, I'm reading his lips.  He just said, it's moving.  I'm just going to keep moving it so he thinks it's broken.  Oh, probably punches it angrily. 
[02:33:30]  Can he talk to him?  No.  Through the radio, I can.  Hi.  Hi, alarm guy.  Why is it moving around crazily?  He has no clue.  He's boggled at this.  His face is puzzled.  He's puzzled.  He goes, why is it moving?  He looks like Rogan from that angle.  He does a little bit.  He's nose and lips.  Rogan and Bobo.  Rogan and his kissable lips.  I'll leave him alone.  All right.  Now I'm just going to continue. 
[02:34:00]  Then you got Michael Phelps in fourth.  Then fifth is Tom Brady.  He had a nice decade.  Usain Bolt.  Who's that?  Sprenner.  He's a fucking marathon runner.  Oh, oh.  Remember Ted Bolt?  Is he fast?  Ted Bolt.  Remember him?  Ted Bolt.  Me run very quickly, bud.  What time me run, dearie?  Is he fast?  He's shattering records at this point.  Usain Bolt is the real deal.  Then you got Jimmy Johnson.  And then wrapping up to ten is Peyton Manning and Shaq. 
[02:34:30]  Shaqalicious.  Shaqalicious.  And we got more reaction from the street about Tiger Woods.  And now there's rumors of steroids.  That's going to be interesting if that comes out.  Do they test golfers?  I don't know how that works.  I think they do.  Probably with that kind of money at stake.  Yeah, no calves.  Fucking cabless fuck.  He's all upper body.  To me, if all this had been going on the whole time, he never would have got the award.  So, they're really, there's no separation. 
[02:35:00]  Tiger Woods is Tiger Woods.  And he's the same, you know, on the course and off the course.  He is a phenomenal player.  So, I would probably not give him athlete of the decade.  Maybe golf player of the decade.  But athlete of the decade, it would be nice to have somebody that set a great role model and a great example.  Oh, my God.  Why?  Why are we in the same world with these people?  Hears.  Gives a shit.  We're a role model. 
[02:35:30]  I ain't a good role model.  Really?  Why?  Because you hang out with these athletes when you're not watching them on TV?  Yeah.  Stop it.  Give a shit what they do.  You don't need a role model.  Parents are role models.  If you're not a role model for your kid, then you're a shitty parent.  An athlete's job is to score points.  And if you're a parent and you teach your kid that those are the guys you should emulate, you're a lousy parent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, yeah.  It shouldn't be guy, golf, good guy. 
[02:36:00]  It's ridiculous.  I think he deserves it.  He was a fabulous or is a fabulous athlete.  His prowess on the course, the excitement that he generated in the public makes the honor worthwhile.  Right.  And all of this stuff that's happened to the side?  He's not the man of the decade.  He's not the husband of the decade, but he is the athlete of the decade.  He's thank you.  There you go.  It's unfortunate for all this personal stuff, which I try to ignore.  I think it's rude, and I think it's really the certain media that thrives on that. 
[02:36:30]  But he deserves every accolade because he is a sensational athlete.  Accolades.  Ah.  There you go.  I miss my fans.  Some sanity.  The adulation.  Other Tiger bullet points.  Radar Online.  This is unbelievable.  Remember that cougar, Teresa Rogers?  We talked about her a couple days ago.  She was the older, the oldest one, I think.  Yes.  She's in her late 40s now.  Was trying to get pregnant by Tiger.  Oh, trying.  She got pregnant in late 2003, but it's unclear who the father is because she was having an 
[02:37:00]  affair with a Serbian basketball player as well.  A DNA test was never given to the baby, but she reportedly looks white.  Baby putt?  Oh, she had the baby.  Mm-hmm.  Whoa, get out of here.  Maybe that's where those weird, like, love child, like...  Oh, shit, yo.  There was people whispering about a love child.  Maybe that's what they were referring to, but sounds like it's the other guy's kid.  Again, sources say Tiger's still in contact with Rachel Uchitel. 
[02:37:30]  Uchitel.  I heard some stuff about her.  Rachel.  And they are not over.  They're still doing their thing.  I don't know.  According to a close source.  What do you know about Rachel Uchitel?  I don't know.  I heard.  Again, this is simply...  I don't know how true this is at all, but somebody told me last night that apparently  she was the madam who got him a lot of girls, and so she knows everything, and that's why  he's paying her so much.  But that could be a complete rumor, too.  I mean, I really don't know. 
[02:38:00]  But it was related to me.  I'm like, well, that would make sense as to why he's paying her so much.  I heard a million a year for five years.  But why would he carry on in seeing her as a girlfriend if he was paying her that much  to be quiet?  I don't know.  To shut up.  Yeah, that's really...  It doesn't make sense.  How much trust there?  Maybe it's all bullshit and he's not seeing her still.  You know what's weird?  She leaves New York a couple days ago and is now seven miles, they're saying, from Tiger  Woods.  Wow.  For real.  She's down in the same area as Tiger Woods.  Hanky.  Hanky.  Why would you do that if you're in the middle of this, you know, controversy? 
[02:38:30]  It's bizarre.  And supposedly there's family down there and all that, but still.  It's a million places you could go and hide out for a while.  And then finally, Jessica Simpson taking legal action against Star Magazine.  You hear about this one?  For what?  For insinuating she slept with Tiger.  And Us Magazine, Star Magazine, Star Magazine usually...  They insinuated?  Usually pretty good with their info, but Jessica Simpson's ready to sue saying it's not true.  What was the insinuation?  They had an affair. 
[02:39:00]  No, no, no, but how did they insinuate?  Is it actionable?  They met at a golf tournament in...  Whore!  He fucked her.  Met at some kind of charity golf tournament, I believe.  Help me out if I'm wrong, Dan.  In July, I think.  And I believe within two weeks, ten days, something like that, she broke up with Tony  Roma.  Or the Tony Roma thing.  Oh!  Fell apart.  Don't mean shit.  Well, that's, you know.  And they're insinuating there was an affair that was happening there.  And she's pissed and saying it's not true. 
[02:39:30]  For the record, she's saying it's not true.  That's silly.  What record?  She got a record?  Um...  Be-ne-pe-be-be-ne.  Nothing.  She hasn't made a record in a while.  All right.  All righty.  Is everything smooth out for tomorrow?  It's good, right?  I'm glad that we have listeners coming in.  I'm glad we have the guys coming in that we do.  We don't even know if we got those guys.  No, I mean...  We're scrambling...  Boston, I think Florentine's coming in.  We'll have fun.  As us, we'll have fun.  Yeah, I know that.  As us.  With the fans, we'll have fun.  We're scrambling motherfuckers right now trying to make something work tomorrow. 
[02:40:00]  I won't worry about it.  Yeah.  The show I have no problem with.  We're going to show our true talent tomorrow.  In all honesty, dude...  We'll get something really good out of shit.  Penny Stock and Steven Singer and these sponsors...  I'm not sucking sponsors' asses, but they've been really good.  They believe in the show.  It's nice.  It's fucking nice to have sponsors that believe in the show.  Yes.  And come on board.  Yeah, man.  Some of these phonies back away from talent.  And, you know, these people just ran right on board to a radio show that has none. 
[02:40:30]  We got a great product.  How'd that get a zero?  We give them the best.  How did my joke get a zero?  Oh, no.  Because I don't feel like laughing right now.  Oh, no.  Did you not hear it?  No.  No.  Travis, did you catch my bomb?  No, I certainly didn't, but I'll go back.  Oh, no.  I'm surprised you didn't.  A zilch show.  It's like a minute behind this.  It's very rare that I bomb.  Oh, give me that.  Very rare.  Very rare.  I would say probably first one if this is even a bomb.  Oh, it is.  I doubt it.  It didn't deserve a bomb.  It was a genius.  But, um, Travis. 
[02:41:00]  What did it entail?  Us not being a good radio show.  All right.  Just play from a minute ago, Travis, before I bite your face.  Let's hear it.  What are you doing?  You get the live version?  You want me to find it?  Just play for a minute.  Someone had a great line about the live thing.  Hold on, hold on.  You know, he said that Canadians love live versions.  Oh, that's true.  Oh, really?  That's a great line, man.  That makes sense.  Canadians love their live music.  They buy live fucking albums. 
[02:41:30]  Ugh.  Live CDs.  All right, sorry.  Good, Travis.  I'm trying to make something more.  I won't worry about it.  Yeah.  On the show, I have no problem with it.  I'm going to show our true talent tomorrow.  In all honesty, dude.  I'm going to get something really good out of shit.  Penny Stock and Steven Singer and these sponsors.  I'm not sucking sponsors' asses, but I mean, they've been really good.  They believe in the show.  It's nice.  You know, it's fucking nice to have sponsors that believe in the show.  Yes.  And come on board.  Yeah, man.  Some of these phonies back away from talent.  And, you know, these people just ran right on board to a radio show that has none. 
[02:42:00]  We got a great product.  How'd that get us?  Thank you.  Oh, okay.  Was it that bad?  All right.  No, no.  Good self-deprecation.  You know what, though?  It sounded too sincere.  It was a serious thought.  I was joking.  It was disguised pretty well.  Yeah, I was listening to the tone of it, and it's like, yeah, yeah, sure, sure.  What?  Your joke had a Halloween costume.  Yeah, exactly.  I didn't recognize it.  No, I didn't recognize it either.  All right.  It was dressed up as a boring statement.  All right, my fault.  Guys, D-Boy worked on a production piece for Christmas. 
[02:42:30]  Good for fucking D-Boy.  It's called A Visit from St. Nicholas, narrated by Big A and Stalker Patty.  We'll go to break with this, but if there's something in here we've got to comment about,  we'll just jump back on.  How's that sound?  Sure.  All right.  D-Boy, everyone.  The Opie and Anthony Show proudly presents A Visit from St. Nicholas, narrated by Big A  and Stalker Patty.  Twas, twas, twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was 
[02:43:00]  Herbing, not even a mouse.  The Harkins were hung by the chimney with a care in hopes that St. Nicholas soon will be here. 
[02:43:30]  I mean, he'll be there.  The children were nestled all snug in their beds while visions of sugar plums danced in 
[02:44:00]  their heads, and Mama, in her kerchief and I and my cap, had to settle our brains for  a long winter's nap.  When I went out on the lawn, there was such a clatter.  I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.  The moon on the breast of the new falling snow gave luster of midday to objects below. 
[02:44:30]  When, what to my wondering eyes should appear, but a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer.  With a little old driver, so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. 
[02:45:00]  He was more rapid than eagles.  His coursers, they came, and he whistled and shouted and called them by name.  Now Dasher, now Dancer, now Prancer and Victim.  On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner and Blitzen.  To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall. 
[02:45:30]  Now Dasherway, Dasherway, Dasherway Hall.  As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle around to the sky.  So up to the housetop, the coursers, they flew with a sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas' tomb. 
[02:46:00]  And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof the prancing and pawing of each little hoop.  As I drew on my head and was turning around, down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bow.  He was dressed in all, he was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot. 
[02:46:30]  And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and a bundle of toys he had flung on his back.  And he, and he, and he, and he looked like a peddler, just opening his back.  His eyes, how they twinkled. His dimples, how merry.  His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry. 
[02:47:00]  His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, and the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.  And the pipe, he held tight in his teeth and the smoke encircled his head, like a wreath. 
[02:47:30]  He had a blonde face and a little round belly that shook him when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.  He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, and I laughed when I saw him in spite of myself.  A wink of his eye and a twist of his head soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. 
[02:48:00]  He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work.  And filled all his, and filled all his, and filled all his markings, and turned a jerk and laying his finger aside of his nose. 
[02:48:30]  Giving a nod up the chimney, he rose, he sprang to a sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, and away they all flew like the down of a thistle.  But I heard him explain, ere he drove out of sight, happy Christmas to all, and to all a good night. 
[02:49:00]  This concludes the Opie and Anthony Show's version of A Visit from St. Nicholas.  If you lasted all the way through it, congratulations.  But I will say, I mean, before we go back on, that Gary has a larger cock than I thought. 
[02:49:30]  And he walked into the restroom.  Yeah, he walked into the bathroom, and there I was, and mine was out.  I didn't think it was all that impressive.  I didn't either, but he may be slight of frame, but Jesus, he really makes up for it.  I see you were discussing the situation for another 15 minutes, Jimmy.  Actually, other situations.  Other situations that involve you? 
[02:50:00]  My situation.  But again, he's beyond, he can't do anything.  He was just, again, I like the guy, for real.  And I know it doesn't matter if I like him.  For real?  Yeah, I mean, as a guy, I like him.  I think that he's sincere.  I don't think he's a phony.  I think he's trying, and, you know, I like Gary.  Again, he's an odd man.  He should be sitting on the larger man's shoulder.  We're popping out of the chest of somebody, like a weird growth person.  But he's a nice little fellow. 
[02:50:30]  Are you debating him with Quato?  Yeah, I don't know what he is.  He's an odd man who, he looks like he's not of this world.  He's otherworldly.  Yeah.  He should be popping up in between sidewalk cracks when it's raining.  But he is a nice guy.  And I think he's sincere.  Just an odd visual.  He's visually not the most pleasant.  We should sit down with the man behind the curtain.  That's what I say.  The man behind the curtain. 
[02:51:00]  Say Moby.  He's Moby?  Look.  Wow.  That is exactly what he is.  Well, Moby has a little more, like, gruff.  He would actually look like Moby.  Moby with a clean shave.  He would look like Moby if he were slightly more masculine and much tougher.  Dude, if you want to look like Moby, just get a pair of very tiny glasses and put it on your cock.  Because it's the same fucking thing.  I bet if you put Moby cock in the search engine or Moby. 
[02:51:30]  Danny finds everything.  I think I finally came up with something so original it's not on the internet yet.  It's got to be.  Moby cock pictures.  Who's in?  Danny will find it.  Who's in?  I'm sure somebody put...  Oh, dude, Moby means big, like Moby dick.  Believe me.  Yeah, but somebody put...  I bet...  I bet someone put glasses on their dick.  And said this is Moby.  And said it's Moby.  Hey, uh...  If they didn't, I claim it.  Very good news.  Very good news.  Really?  We got a snowboard to give away. 
[02:52:00]  A love board.  Jimmy, where's that love board?  Um, it's actually a very cool thing.  That's not quite it.  I don't know.  Yeah, that's disgusting.  That looks like Alf.  Oh, there it is.  The snowboard.  This is, uh...  This one has a plastic on it that the other one did not have.  Yeah, plastic cover.  Yeah, to protect it.  Two hot chicks.  It's really a cool board.  Two very hot chicks.  It's the love board.  I'm not even a snowboarder, and this is something I would want.  Yes.  Because it's, uh... 
[02:52:30]  It's hot.  But it's cool.  It's, uh, from Burton Boards, right?  Yeah.  I bet that thing melts the snow as it goes along, because the girls on it are so hot.  Right?  I would say so.  Oh, yeah.  That's why they call it the love board.  There's one blonde girl on one side.  There's, uh...  A brunette on the other, and a dog in the middle going,  What do you want from me?  Yeah.  Actually, the dog's not there.  Why don't we give out the Burton board?  Yeah, give it away now.  Go to Burton.com if you want to check out their love board. 
[02:53:00]  The one we're talking about, I'm sure it's online.  Love Snowboard.  Burton's Love Snowboard.  We got one to give away right now, right?  The Love Board.  A love board and gift card from Burton Snowboards.  Check out their latest gear, and find your local dealers at...  Anyone?  Burton.com.  Believe in snowboarding.  We've got to fix that door.  Sounds loud.  Hey, Bobo's on the line.  What?  The show couldn't get any worse. 
[02:53:30]  Hey, Bobo, how are you?  I got an announcement for tomorrow about the bit I'll be doing.  I'll be playing the kazoo while the homeless sing, like a little homeless choir.  What are you doing?  No, like, while I have all the homeless sing, like sing some Christmas songs,  and I'll play the kazoo along with them.  What's a kazoo?  That's your bit tomorrow?  A kazoo, it sounds like this.  That's your big bit tomorrow, huh?  That's it, huh?  I'm going to be playing that while they all sing. 
[02:54:00]  That's it.  That's fucking great, dude.  Now, first of all, who told you you could just come up with ideas for the show  and, like, inject yourself into the bit or project that we have going on?  Yeah.  Who said that?  I don't know.  I don't know if Danny thought of it.  He put him ratting you out.  Anthony, are you thinking what I'm thinking?  What?  Are you thinking what I'm thinking?  What?  2010, it's time to move Bobo to the Ron and Fez show, like the rest of them.  Ah, right. 
[02:54:30]  Moving Bobo to Ron and Fez, and we get new people.  Hand-me-down kooks.  That's right.  That's what they get.  Ron and Fez get our handy...  Hand-me-down kooks.  Are they hand-me-downs?  Yeah.  I thought they were handy-downs.  Did you think forever that when clothes went from the older brother to the younger brother,  it was called handy-downs?  I...  Are we being honest today?  Yeah.  No, I didn't think so.  Hand-me-downs, yes.  Ron and Fez get our hands. 
[02:55:00]  Because you're handing them down.  Hand-me-down.  Yeah.  But you said hammy.  It's all right.  Don't worry.  You're not a fugitive or anything.  Wait, what do you say?  What?  What is it?  Hand-me-downs.  That's what I say.  I thought you said handy-downs.  Oh, hand-me-downs.  Oh, yeah.  I might have just mispronounced it a little bit.  Oh, hand-me-downs.  That's what a liquor-filled woman says.  I might have said that.  All right, so I was a little off on the pronunciation, but...  Disappointed mom says after the delivery. 
[02:55:30]  Laying in that hospital bed.  Bobo.  I'm hearing you cry like Rosemary's baby.  Thank you, Bobo.  We'll see you tomorrow for the big kazoo thing.  The husband's just smiling because...  Believe me, I got a couple of songs to play a dough.  All right.  All right.  You got it?  Thank you, Bobo.  Jesus fucking Christ.  It's time to move Bobo to run a fast.  They'll appreciate it.  Take a little more money off of that haircut budget. 
[02:56:00]  Jesus.  Guys, Travis has just handed in...  What?  Opie, Anthony's, and Jim's bombs of 2009.  All right, so you got a 30-second clip.  See?  No, he really went after you hard because you got 10, Jimmy.  Hard.  How many do we all have?  We got a few.  Are we all stupid?  Who do you want to start with? 
[02:56:30]  I'll throw myself under the bus.  No, that's what I was thinking.  Whoever goes first, the listeners aren't going to remember those bombs.  True, that's why I asked them.  I know what you're thinking.  That means Jimmy's last.  All right, so now it's between you and I.  Nice.  How about we play Pick One?  Okay.  Mine.  No.  Look, you got a 50-50 chance right here in your hand.  Okay.  One disc is my bombs, and one is yours.  Ready?  And?  Which one?  Right hand.  Meaning what?  That hand.  Is the one out?  Your right hand is the one that gets played. 
[02:57:00]  Gets played?  Played.  It's Hopi.  Very good.  Clubs and bombs of 2009.  Okay.  Let's start with this one.  But the Nassau legislature is back in Republican hands, so Swazi doesn't have full reign of  the pen for, you know, whatever he wants to do. 
[02:57:30]  Is he over his brother's death?  Who?  Swazi.  Yeah?  I don't know.  Was he?  What?  Patrick Swazi.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  So bad, it's funny.  Can I tell you, now we're back live, what I liked about that, though, was Ope's very  sweet Patrick Swazi.  Patrick Swazi.  That did actually make it almost not a bomb. 
[02:58:00]  Almost.  Yeah, yeah.  It still was a bomb, but it made it almost not a bomb.  The delivery was what kept, almost made it not a bomb, right?  Yeah.  Patrick Swazi.  Oh, God.  What was the context, though?  Hmm?  What was the context of that?  What do you mean?  I don't know.  What was I going for there?  Patrick Swazi.  No, I know his name, though.  I really do know his name.  It sounded too loud in here, and you were trying to quiet it down like a library, and  you succeeded with that one. 
[02:58:30]  Swazi?  I really know his name, though.  Yeah?  Swazi?  It's Swayze.  I know that.  Yeah.  I really do.  Yeah.  You're probably just reading it and, you know, being silly.  It's funny.  All right.  We move on to the next one.  Let's see.  Mm-hmm.  Good.  Well, and before you change the page, Larry the Cable Guy, Health Inspector?  Oh, God.  Was that a sequel to Larry the Cable Guy?  No, that was his first movie.  That was his first movie.  He's got to have Larry the Cable Guy in the title.  He can work him into the title.  You guys don't. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  He's got Delta Farce.  He's got that.  Witless Protection in the top ten.  I'm sure they're not great movies, but I do think that the critics are going to attack  it just because it's Larry the Cable Guy and they're not going to like his humor.  Although, I'm sure they're not great movies.  I'm sure they're going to be stunk on ice.  Can I just stop the interview?  Yeah.  You can't let me slide.  I'm looking at Larry the Cable Guy and I'm thinking the fucking Jim Carrey cable fucking  good movie.  We didn't know that.  Oh, no.  Oh.  I have an uncomfortable feeling. 
[02:59:30]  Nobody knows that.  I didn't notice you.  You can't let that just let him alone.  I'm like, is Larry the Cable Guy, Health Inspector, the sequel to Cable Guy?  Oh, I didn't even catch that.  Oh, I thought you said to Larry the Cable Guy.  I am so uncomfortable.  I just want to leave.  Who cares if you humiliated yourself?  I didn't even notice it.  Thank God you guys aren't good listeners.  Who cares if you humiliated yourself?  That's awesome.  Honestly, we're back live.  It really doesn't matter.  I mean, the fact is it was nobody noticed it.  Yeah, yeah.  True.  Nobody noticed it.  How did we not pick it up? 
[03:00:00]  Because I had to bring to everyone's attention how awful that was.  That was horrendous.  I'm sure a listener probably would have.  We'll go back.  We move on to Anthony now.  Ah!  A couple from Anthony.  Oh, boy.  I've had some.  Some of the big bombs and flubs of 2009 from Anthony.  Some humdingers in my day, that's for sure.  Threatened Jimmy with a, well, you got to sleep sometime, I think was the line.  Which meant that Jimmy should have had his throat slit in his sleep by Jesse Ventura. 
[03:00:30]  Which would have been odd.  You could have sued, Jimmy.  I don't know.  For what?  Sleep deferation?  Right.  Yeah, sue, go.  I haven't slept since you were here last.  Thanks a lot.  I've been awake for 18 months, Jess.  But Jimmy always has what he likes to call a tranny shield on it.  Just in case anybody comes in at night.  Oh, no.  No?  Nothing?  No, it was funny.  I was tripping over it.  I knew you were.  My tongue isn't working yet.  You fumbled drunkly into the room with that one.  I love that dog bit.  That's terrible.  Yeah, that was a bad one. 
[03:01:00]  I remember that one.  I hate this bit.  I just, I just, I just, I just, I just.  I love this bit.  I really, it's one of my favorite ones.  It's so uncomfortable.  Because other shows, honestly, other shows don't do it.  They don't showcase.  Would you?  When they bomb.  Would you?  What happened?  I'm just thinking, would you?  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, something, something going on there.  What do you mean something?  What?  Something is a female ass. 
[03:01:30]  Yeah, but it's, it's like, it's, it's, it's, it's approaching maximum density.  No, no, I mean for, if it's any bigger, there's a problem.  Are you trying to say the shelf life is about to run out?  Exactly.  The milk is almost sour?  Yes.  Yes, it's almost sour?  It's right at the high limit, which is, which is fine right there.  That's, that's good.  That's, that's, you know.  Next week's, uh, check share.  But you never know when you might open it up and give it a sniff and go, oh, I think this  went bad. 
[03:02:00]  That fucking, yeah, right?  Danny would like that.  In the skirt.  Stop, I'm sad.  I'm in total agreement.  I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been, I've been  I've been pooping.  You are a degenerate.  Disney's got to hire you for your noises.  What's that?  I love it.  You've got to be in animation.  No, I don't do enough voices.  That was some good fun.  What am I going to be, a cartoon character over here or something? 
[03:02:30]  See?  You're like Michael, uh, Winslow.  Is that his name?  Oh, God.  I don't know.  I wish it was like, uh.  Do some more noises.  Michael Corleone.  Do some of your noises.  Ant and I will tell you, uh, we'll tell you what you're doing.  You suck.  All right.  It's a machine gun.  There's a fucking guy with his hat again.  It's a machine gun.  I do good sounds.  Oh, yeah.  She's going to love that one.  Another bomb or flub from Ant.  Sure.  Because my doctor wants me to get the test. 
[03:03:00]  Because of his body.  The test used to be, the test used to be the big one.  Test out the doctor's new scale.  That's what they said after he got off a plane.  The test used to be the big one.  But now when the doctor says you need the test, they're talking about the pandemic.  That is the swine flow.  Of course, uh, Obama, you know, throwing two billion more dollars.  He's being tested for H.I.  weight.  See, you say it different.  It's high weight.  Yes.  Oh, Jesus.  What? 
[03:03:30]  Please hold on.  Not high like hello.  High like high like, uh, a lot of.  But then you heard the H.I., you thought I was going to say V. But then I didn't.  I said weight.  Oh, high weight.  Instead of H.I.  weight.  See, see, it's a, that's why I kind of, I kind of stretched out the H.I. part when everyone's  going to go, okay, he's going to say H.I.  The more I understand it, the worse it gets.  Yeah, that was a bad one, too.  Oh, H.I. 
[03:04:00]  weight.  Is Wendy Williams starting to look hot?  Stop it.  I just want to throw that out there.  I want to say hot, but she looks better.  Looks better, right?  Your LASIK is worn off now completely.  Why?  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know.  What do you think?  You need to have your eyes redone.  I agree.  I really do.  I think she looks sexier in a big breast.  Stop it.  She looks good there, man.  I think she does.  I think she's got.  She lost some weight.  She looks good.  And her breasts are bigger.  It looks like she lost a little weight.  And her hair, she looks way better with darker hair, right?  She should be in the f***, eaten f*** off of a f***. 
[03:04:30]  Just stop it.  Stop it.  Whoa.  She should be f*** from her f*** from a f***.  I'm not saying like over the top, wow.  I'm just saying I'm a little better.  Oh, look at the face.  A little better.  Her gut looks good.  She's got a thin little weight.  She looks good, man.  She's a big girl, but she looks f***ing sexy.  No, she doesn't.  I have to disagree.  I'm just saying a little better.  Oh, yeah.  Get her in the sack.  Pull that wig off.  You just see some f***ing bald head. 
[03:05:00]  So what?  I'd f*** Pesci and JFK.  I got cancer in her neck.  I've had it for years.  Her f***ing wigs on a thing like this.  Jesus.  That's a stupid movie.  There's f***ing.  There's f***ing nothing there.  There's f***ing nothing there.  Do you think she has bad breath?  No.  She's just f***ing smelly.  She's got them big, f***ing, cock-eyed, watery Oprah eyes.  Her show's a hit, though.  Yeah, it certainly is.  She was huge on radio, man.  She has a massive audience. 
[03:05:30]  Yeah, but this is like a completely different audience.  This is f***ing...  The audience that she's getting, it has nothing to do with a radio audience.  Um...  It's just, it's like Tyra.  She's like Tyra.  Yeah.  You know?  She goes and babbles into these f***ing...  It's a ghetto version of Tyra.  There's something very regular about Wendy Williams.  There's something very...  And she's a good talker.  There's something very regular about her.  That's nice.  Maury's got the pedophilia show on today.  Oh, I know them, kids.  Wonderful.  Oh, who are they?  Oh, that's Daniel and Marissa. 
[03:06:00]  They dance.  Jesus.  Great names.  Well, you know what?  Sometimes you reach into the well you don't mean to.  Honestly, no foresight in that.  Apparently not.  Sorry about that.  You're just pulling up names.  I guess the mind is an odd thing.  Sorry.  Oh, that's great.  Sorry about that, Daniel.  You know.  Oh, my God.  You know that Maury's beating Oprah? 
[03:06:30]  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, no.  For what?  Jumping on his...  All right.  Hey, breaking news, motherfuckers.  Breaking news, motherfuckers.  Breaking fucking news.  Yeah.  Chris Henry of the Cincinnati Bengals.  He fell out of a truck.  Had an accident, right?  Yeah.  He's fucking dead.  Holy shit.  I heard it was serious.  He's a fucking...  He was an NFL star.  Oh, was he a big star in the NFL? 
[03:07:00]  Hell fucking yeah.  Chris Henry of the Cincinnati Bengals is dead.  He fell out of his own truck?  A lot of people saying it, including Tommy and Chase B from Atlanta and others.  Wait, wait.  Bengals Henry dies at 26.  Holy shit.  Yeah, he was in a pretty bad accident with his truck.  He fell out, I guess.  And there wasn't many updates on the accident.  And now we're...  Are the back?  Huh?  Oh, no.  He fell out of the back of the pickup truck in what authorities describe as a domestic dispute  with his fiance. 
[03:07:30]  Wow.  What the hell is going on?  So he must have jumped in the pickup and the fiance is driving away and he tumbles  out the back.  You're smart, dude.  It's probably not.  Wow.  That's probably it.  Oh, my God.  Oh, you just read that?  No, I didn't read it.  I swear.  What was his initial injury?  A head injury?  Oh, it did.  Did he...  Did he...  It had to be.  You clunk your head like that.  Oh, my God.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  You're not bad.  You must feel like you're just arguing and five minutes later, your person is dead. 
[03:08:00]  And now he's dead.  Yeah, Chris Henry was a star, man.  Holy crap.  Thank you for the breaking news, guys.  Appreciate it.  That sinks.  I don't really...  I don't know him.  I don't know the man.  There's going to be some bummed out fantasy football players.  Oh, yeah?  All right, Jim's bombs.  A couple of Jimmy's bombs before we get out of here today.  It's 10-11 already?  Holy shit.  Now, can you believe it?  Yes.  Oh, Dana White's in town, huh?  Yeah. 
[03:08:30]  UFC guy.  Have we ever seen him live?  I have.  I met him in Vegas, but he's up in the middle.  He's just on phoners with us, right?  Oh, he's on the phone.  Be funny if it's just a mouth that comes in.  There's no person attached to it.  It'd be funny if it wasn't the operative word.  Yes.  Horrifying, might be.  Wouldn't you just scream?  It would be something.  It's a mouth.  I would.  It's always cool when you're bombing and somebody else decides to strap the plutonium to their  chest and jump in.  I wanted to jump in and try to save you.  I appreciate it. 
[03:09:00]  I was eating.  That was a good double bombing.  I appreciate it.  Yep.  I was fucking Hiroshima and fucking Nakakumiya had to pop along.  Oops.  Let's move on to the next one from Jimmy.  Who's what?  What are you promoting, Jimmy?  New Year's?  New Year's in Fort Lauderdale Improv.  I only have, and then this Friday, my Long Island shows are both sold out, but there  might be a few tickets for people that couldn't take the rescheduling, but in Bayshore, these  are my, I'm actually doing that.  My head's spinning.  Yeah, I'm confused now. 
[03:09:30]  What happened?  My Bayshore gigs were rescheduled twice.  Yes, but what do you mean for other people with tickets that want to come make one?  Some people probably couldn't do this show because they were rescheduled twice.  So anyway, I couldn't make the Bayshore shows for this Friday night.  Kind of a scumbag would reschedule something twice.  A guy that fucking, what am I going to do?  When fucking, uh, J-L-E-N-O wants me, I go.  Bayshore.  Yes.  I'm very excited.  I think I'm going to see.  I would hope so, yeah.  Two shows Friday.  Does NBC treat you nice? 
[03:10:00]  Honestly, dude, NBC is fucking fantastic.  They really do.  They really are.  It's exactly as an entertainer.  Tell us what it's like.  They fly me first class.  Sit back, Danny.  He's going to tell us what it's like.  Let me, let me shut my eyes and imagine.  Yeah, let me dream a little bit.  I'm going to imagine.  Can we have some nice, warm music, Travis?  I want to know what it's like.  Jimmy, be like Peter Pan.  Jimmy's about to tell us how NBC treats him.  Make us fly.  Please.  I want to feel like I'm flying.  Do we have some good music for this, Travis?  Here it is.  Travis, come on.  Some happy music.  Come on. 
[03:10:30]  My eyes are closed like Anthony's.  Yes.  Hey, stop touching me, you weirdo.  Put some nice music on, Travis, before I cut your throat.  Like a, yeah, nice.  Travis, you momentum drainer.  Holy shit.  He'll play the live version of something.  Yeah, yeah.  Something nice music.  It'll be fucking Nazi marching music.  Just find some live Yanni.  Oh, my God.  That's all you need is some new age shit.  Come on.  Let's go.  He's sweating in his stupid beard.  Oh, look at him.  That idiot.  You fucking traitorous.  Play something from Keys to the Imagination.  That would be a Yanni scene. 
[03:11:00]  Oh, there you go.  Holy shit.  Can we get somebody more confident back there like Butch's asshole?  First track of Keys to the Imagination, please, if you will.  Please, if you will, Travis.  God.  Yanni's a big seller.  NBC.  Hmm?  Travis.  NBC.  Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Tell us what it's like, Jimmy.  Please.  They, um...  Well, they mentioned me in press conferences.  Wow.  And they included my name in the new Jay Leno show when it was being promoted as somebody 
[03:11:30]  that they were happy to have aboard.  Really and truly, Jimmy?  Really and truly?  Tell us more.  Everything they've told me, they've not only done, but they've done a little more.  More?  More than they told me.  More than they had to, Jimmy?  Because they value my service.  What is that word?  Value.  Value.  They fly me out.  Value.  First class airfare.  Value.  First class.  They give me a nice hotel room and they pick me up and bring me there. 
[03:12:00]  Value?  Oh, you don't need the definition.  It's NBC.  They value me.  And then...  Oh, God.  They promote me.  They put me on television.  Promote.  And they honor what they said they would.  Promote.  It really is nice.  Wow.  The vibe is amazing.  Can we go with you, Uncle Jimmy?  I could bring you along.  They'd be happy to meet you.  Do they look at you like they want you there?  Not only do they not hide me, they named a segment after me. 
[03:12:30]  What?  Jim Norton, uninvited guest.  Why would they do something like that?  Because they're happy to have me there?  Happy.  And they want me to know that?  And most importantly, they've paid me everything.  Wow.  So nice.  That's magical.  For diem.  My hotel room is reimbursed, airfare reimbursed, and my money for being there and money for travel days. 
[03:13:00]  Wow.  And they promote whatever I want, which is my books.  Do they protect you if you get in trouble, Jimmy?  Of course.  Of course they do.  Amazing.  Of course they do.  Wow.  What about the warm cookies?  The dresser room always has whatever I want inside of it.  It has fruit, vegetables, cold water sodas, and some coffee.  Fruit?  Yeah.  Yes.  Their producer says hello and knows what's going on.  Wow.  All right.  What does that sound like, Jimmy?  What does that sound like? 
[03:13:30]  That's impossible.  The highest profile talent they have does nothing but promote the platform he's on and comes  in and says hello to me every time.  Oh, damn.  That's great.  And they're winners.  This is...  They're winners.  This is magical and amazing.  I don't know how to ask.  Travis, it's magical.  Where is this wondrous land?  Burbank, California.  Burbank.  Office is here, I'm sure.  Do you have room in your suitcase for us, Jimmy?  Oh, it's a big suitcase.  Oh, filled with things I bought when NBC paid me the money they promised me. 
[03:14:00]  Turn it up, Travis.  Turn it up.  It sounds perfect.  Are there any there?  Unfortunately so.  But they're kept in the back.  Stupid Mondays.  Oh, I really honestly do love that.  I wouldn't hold it against you loving it. 
[03:14:30]  I love Fox, too.  I have to say, they've been very consistent and nice to me.  Yeah.  I've always had a fine experience dealing with Fox, except once.  They've made me feel very welcome.  So, let's do another bomb from Network, Jimmy.  Good luck!  Jimmy.  I should have that clip here every day, by the way.  Ah, chicken fucker.  B-Rock has decided that we don't really need to play that anymore.  Why has he done that?  Dustin in Texas.  Well, who's bragging about doing that in Texas?  Hello?  No. 
[03:15:00]  Wait, wait.  What?  No?  Hey, I know you're reading a list, and I'm going to let you finish.  But Anchorman was one of the best movies of our time.  One of the best movies of our time.  We got Kanye West on the phone.  Thank you, Kanye.  There's like three different things happening at once here today.  Dustin.  Yeah.  Dustin.  Yeah.  Got it.  Apparently, the listeners got it, too.  What the hell?  Yeah, that was a good one, Jimmy.  Yeah, that was bad.  Who would brag about doing that?  Oof. 
[03:15:30]  Yeah.  I want to go home.  Why?  I want to hear more.  No, we don't want to talk to that person, because I want to go home.  Here's another bomb from Network Jimmy.  Boof.  Get that one.  No, he's reading the sign.  All right.  I'm with that.  What's the sign say again, Ed?  It says,  Bon't go home with mope. 
[03:16:00]  Stupid Patty.  All right.  Next bomb is from who?  Did you read that as Lou Ferrigno, or is that really how it...  Bon't go home with mope.  It's like a deaf person reading it.  By the way, I threw out a monumental bomb.  Oh, damn it.  That nobody...  I can't believe...  Well, they'll catch it on the replay.  Do we have it?  I can't believe no one does it.  Oh, Travis has it right now.  Was that Travis getting it?  Because he saw...  Oh, boy, did I...  Oh, shit. 
[03:16:30]  Hang on.  Let's see.  I just got to find it.  Hang on.  It was a...  It was a monumental...  Oh, damn it.  I would have gotten the same reaction as how you were talking.  I just rolled a grape on the table.  All right.  I got it.  Okay.  Well, here it is.  Because I had a bat in my kitchen, and I decided the best way to get rid of the bat  was with my fire extinguisher.  Just fucking pick it up and put it with your glove and ball.  And I completely...  Completely destroyed my...  Wait.  Just do what?  Pick it up and put it with your glove and ball.  You said that? 
[03:17:00]  I know.  I'm embarrassed I even thought it...  Okay.  Fuck it.  Patrice.  Back live.  Having a lot of fun there.  Put it with your...  Ball and glove.  Ball and glove.  You said that?  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  You want one more?  Yeah.  Uno mas.  From Network Jimmy.  For more.  Network Jimmy.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, fuck. 
[03:17:30]  That's interesting.  Because Roger Daltrey didn't write any of those songs, right?  Wasn't it all Pete Townsend?  Pretty much Townsend, yeah.  Like, Roger Daltrey looks fine there.  Yeah.  Look at Pete Townsend.  It looks like a ventriloquist with a Down Syndrome puppet.  Jimmy's back.  Nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, Pete did write most of the songs.  Like, my generation.  I like to fuck people, not from my generation.  Because the kids...  Wow. 
[03:18:00]  Wow.  That's not what I meant.  You want to come back in from the bathroom?  Hold on.  Come back in.  Yeah, come back in.  That never happened.  Do a sitcom entrance, too, Jimmy.  Please.  That never happened.  Jimmy's going to do a sitcom entrance.  It could be one of Jimmy's worst bombs ever on the show.  What time?  Was he going for some kind of stuttering joke?  Jimmy!  Jimmy's back.  I'm back.  Hey, you're looking at the Who?  Yeah.  I heard Pete Townsend wrote a lot of their stuff.  Yeah.  Like, I don't like to fuck girls from my generation.  See? 
[03:18:30]  I figured I'd bomb twice.  We can't allow that moment to pass.  Do the big...  Oh, ah.  Yeesh.  I guess we're back live.  That was...  Wow.  That was monumental.  Oh.  I forgot that one.  That was utter silence.  So, I had a laugh.  And I liked where it was coming from.  He doesn't...  Didn't he write a song called My Generation?  Like, a place he doesn't...  There was something there. 
[03:19:00]  That's one you should write.  Yeah.  Not say off the cuff.  Exactly.  You know?  Yeah, I hear you.  Too bad he never fucks girls from his generation.  Yeah.  You know?  Yeah.  You can try it again now.  My generation.  That's why he stutters.  He just...  They're so young, he can't get it out.  My generation.  His fingers are sweaty.  You've redeemed yourself months later.  Yes.  I hear you've got quite a cock on you.  May I see it?  I want another bum from Hope and another bum from Man. 
[03:19:30]  It's only...  Nope.  Not happening.  Gregorio.  Not happening.  Tomorrow it'll happen.  We'll do more tomorrow.  I gotta go.  I really got somewhere to go.  Um...  Oh, Steve from Bayshore.  He's a bum.  His stupid hairdo.  Steve from Bayshore, I want you waiting by the phone all day long.  Why?  What the fuck's up with him?  I might have a ticket to the Islander Ranger game tonight at Nassau Coliseum.  Oh, you need him to drive you?  No, I'll drive. 
[03:20:00]  No, I mean just drive you, drop you off and pick you up.  That'd be great, man.  How great would that be?  Just stop by my car when you're done.  But I need him by the phone all day.  I'm only going to try once.  Yeah.  If this ticket becomes available.  I'd invite him, but you don't really like hockey, so...  I love hockey.  Not to the extent of...  And my sleep is now...  I'm in pure vacation mode with my sleep now.  I've already got it, so I'm not even wasting a day of vacation time with, like, pesky getting 
[03:20:30]  up and go, what's the matter?  Why are you rubbing your balls?  Oh, Jesus Christ, Jimmy.  All right.  That was probably the most offensive Uncle Paul thing ever.  I'm offended.  What are you talking about?  I got agita.  Agita.  Yeah, sure you do.  One more wake up, yes.  That's what the people are saying.  One more wake up.  Who said that?  Mars?  That's Mars' name?  Mars.  I didn't know he could talk.  Who else said something?  Satin?  Let's go.  Satin.  That is Satin. 
[03:21:00]  Satin.  Satin.  Satin.  Satin. </pre>
