<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Opie and Jim Norton, along with studio staff Ben and Steve, addressing negative reviews and their perceived failures.  They discussed competition from Ron and Fez and the expansion of shows in their timeslot, leading to the announcement of a "Golden Tickets" initiative.  Five deserving commercial radio shows would be saved from cancellation, while the rest would land on the infamous "fucko list." Listener input was solicited for nominations.  Numerous callers participated, offering bizarre jokes and nominations, with one caller expressing emotional distress while discussing The Who.  The hosts also detailed their "Assault on the Media" contest, rewarding creative ambushes of media personalities. The lengthy discussion of their failed Blink Radio venture, characterized by excessive spending and a poorly received logo and slogan,  followed.  Norton received several listener gifts, including a sexually suggestive item from Mary Carey, prompting crude descriptions and jokes. A recurring comedic segment mocking a song ("The Phenomenal" bit) played throughout.  The hosts engaged in a lengthy, rambling debate on what constitutes a good cinnamon roll, along with a detailed discussion about the meaning of "punching out" – a caller abruptly ending a call.  A caller inquired about their thoughts on podcasting, sparking a comparison between podcast and traditional radio quality.

The broadcast continued with a focus on listener-submitted "assaults on the media."  Two notable examples were discussed: "Frank from Jersey," whose air horn ambush near a news reporter outside a police station was praised for the idea but criticized for its hesitant execution; and "Simply Lion Man" (Steven) from Auburn, Alabama, who successfully promoted the show in a lion costume behind a news reporter.  Both callers recounted their experiences.  Past assaults, including Opie lifting his shirt in front of a reporter, were recounted, along with suggestions for future stunts using megaphones.  This section also included a discussion of an anti-pay-TV PSA from the 1970s, Jim Norton's detailed and explicit account of his encounter with an escort service ("NY Confidential"), including the sex acts and his subsequent illness, and the subsequent arrest of the owner and an escort, Natalia.  A caller identified "ba-ba-boo" as a trucker's CB radio term, and upcoming guests for the Opie and Anthony Run and Fest were mentioned. *Wedding Crashers* received a brief review.

The show then shifted to a loosely connected discussion.  Rob Schneider's filmography (*Deuce Bigelow*, *The Hot Chick*, *The Animal*) was criticized, segueing into listener calls about STDs from prostitutes, hidden cameras in massage parlors, and personal experiences with sex workers. This led to a discussion about the sex industry, including strippers. A lengthy and offensive discussion about disliked t-shirt designs ensued, with the hosts and callers expressing strong opinions using vulgar language. The closing of CBGB's and their experiences playing there were mentioned.  The hosts debated whether actors actually performed the sex acts depicted in films like *Last Tango in Paris* and *Nine Songs*, also mentioning *The Brown Bunny*.  Two voicemails from "The Gregster," lamenting a romantic rejection, were played.  The show concluded with further discussion of t-shirts, listener calls, and their upcoming trip to the X Games in Los Angeles, including travel plans and the scheduled appearance of Jay Moore as a guest.

A later segment featured a caller, Jeremy, discussing his relationship with his significantly older and heavier wife.  The hosts made crude jokes about her weight and his attraction to larger women.  This transitioned into a discussion of Rafael Palmeiro's positive steroid test, playing audio of Palmeiro's explanations and mocking his claims.  The hosts debated the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball, mentioning various players (Palmeiro, Bonds, McGwire, and Dave Kingman). A call from IndyCar racer Brian Hurta followed, discussing his recent win, the physical demands of racing, safety standards, and the "groupie scene."  Danica Patrick's treatment at an autograph session was also discussed.  Former MLB player Rob Dibble called in, offering his perspective on Palmeiro and steroid use in baseball, discussing stimulant use throughout baseball history, and his opinions on the all-time greatest hitters.

The final segment featured Rob Dibble as a guest. He shared anecdotes from his baseball career, comparing Dave Kingman's inconsistent performance to Tony Gwynn's consistency, and discussed various baseball greats (Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Hank Aaron). He shared opinions on current events, including Barry Bonds and the Yankees' management decisions. A caller, Todd, greeted Dibble and thanked him for an incident involving Doug DeCenzo.  Kingman's statistics were reviewed. The conversation shifted to a news story about a teacher, Sandra Beth Giselle, who had sexual encounters with underage students. The hosts and Dibble reacted with amusement and shock to the details of the story, and the hosts promised to play related audio in a future broadcast. Gamefly.com was advertised, and one host's birthday Starbucks gift card was repeatedly mentioned.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Oh 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you.  Shut the fuck up. 
[00:03:30]  You're a fine bunch of bullies, aren't you?  I'm Opie.  I could give a fuck.  I'm Jim Norton and I'm on the radio.  Shut up.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's all about fun, fun, fun.  I'd love to spit in your face.  I will fucking kill you.  Shut up, stupid.  I'm just a zelter.  I know it.  Who cares?  We're trying to do a fucking radio show.  I know what we're trying to do.  I'm sitting here across from you.  I understand that.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Despicable asshacks.  These dummies at work for us.  You guys stink.  Ben looks like a tall baby.  Always laughing in the wrong places. 
[00:04:00]  Ben, where's the quality?  You rock.  Hopefully he's going through a car wash with his mouth open.  And there's Steve.  Steve is a piece of garbage.  And you stink.  You are cordially invited to a robbery rape.  This is family entertainment.  The show is a disaster.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  If you have any poo, bring it now.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  He's a trash. 
[00:04:30]  I say we don't play clips today.  No clips.  No clips.  We just start like this.  There's a clip embargo.  This is what we do now.  Can I do some clips?  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, no shit.  Well, I have to do this now.  Well, thanks for nothing. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, that's terrific.  Hello.  Hello.  Exactly.  God damn it.  Are you fucking with me?  We look like assholes, man.  Great memories we have.  I know.  We're all just sitting around.  What's another one?  Yeah. 
[00:05:30]  You're a douchebag.  It's not a clip.  I'm just talking to Jimmy.  This proves that Opie and Anthony are failing.  You can use that for anything.  This apple tastes scented.  What proves that we're failing at radio today?  Has anyone read the critics today?  Not only are they adding Ron and Fez to 202, they're giving out golden tickets for four 
[00:06:00]  other shows.  My second favorite thing to the face and the voice, third favorite, I guess, is the typing.  His air typing that he does.  Air typing?  Like, he's typing the email.  But it's not smooth typing.  It's like Herman Munster movements.  The hands are just kind of moving.  Yeah.  Because the listener is so stupid and angry.  It's not the listener.  He can't work his fingers.  It's not really the listener.  It's the critics out there.  They don't even...  They listen.  They don't even listen to the show and then make these outrageous claims about the Opie and 
[00:06:30]  Anthony program.  It's a lot of envy and jealousy of our high positions in the organization.  Really?  You could have it.  You could have this.  You could have it all.  You could have Hawk.  You could have Derek and Danny and Nathaniel.  Cubby and Annette.  You could sit in this seat and enjoy it.  Just like we do.  Ooh.  Well, it's the virus.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Why are you getting all these presents?  It's not a present. 
[00:07:00]  Jimmy and I are very...  Oh, that was something you bought personally.  Oh, I got a great birthday gift.  By the way, thank you for the birthday gift I got.  Some listeners sent me some drill bits for my birthday.  Well, they were the little things that go in the drill.  They have Phillips head.  Yeah.  And slot head and hex head.  And you put it in the drill.  And instead of hurting your little wrist, turning a screwdriver, you just drive it in with  the drill.  You know what head you forgot?  Shithead.  Because I don't have a drill. 
[00:07:30]  It's not a bunch of drill bits that I can just hold and look at.  We were in the office just trying...  It was boggling in my mind why someone would send you little bits for the drill.  But Jimmy, we found out, gets more presents than anybody.  I walk in, my desk maybe has one envelope from like the Manhattan School of Beauty trying  to sign me up.  Some smart-ass listener is signing me up for things.  So I get things, you know, Anthony Cum Face.  It's always addressed with some kind of... 
[00:08:00]  Yeah, they change my name around a little bit.  And it's for the dumbest things.  Need a high school diploma?  Nah.  Nah.  Nah.  I don't think I'll go for that one.  You're doing just fine.  It's the listeners.  They like having fun with me.  And then Jimmy, just...  It's his birthday every day.  He's right.  It's like Christmas around here for you.  He's got boxes coming in.  Anthony and I just stare at each other and then we stare at you as you open up your latest  gifts.  He's at his desk doing one of two things. 
[00:08:30]  Yelling at his computer for the password.  Opening gifts.  But the gifts are like...  It's bittersweet at your desk.  If it's not Yoshi sending me a Mary Carey pocket vagina, it's Dr. Steve sending me chocolates  that are like kind of melted on the bottom.  It's all these odd gifts.  It's some NXIVM.  Does he just put the Cialis right in the chocolate now?  No, but I've requested a little shipment.  We got a West Coast trip, boys.  By the way, we all love vagina.  But anyone else disturbed by Mary Carey's plastic vag? 
[00:09:00]  No.  Opia cracked that package open yesterday.  Did you take a look at it?  Yeah, I was holding it.  I would like to use it.  It's like a jack-off sleeve.  Yeah.  Jacking off.  It's just...  What do you use this for?  Jacking off?  It just didn't look right.  Well, I mean, it's a plastic tube.  No, I understand.  I've seen other fake vagis that look a lot better than that one is what I'm saying.  What's that movie?  10 to Midnight?  10 to Midnight.  Yeah.  The guy Warren with the great cheeks running naked down the street just murdering people.  Naked, killing people, and Charles Bronson chasing them down, right?  Let's go to O-Town. 
[00:09:30]  Bring it on, brother!  Yeah.  All right.  What do you want, tough guy?  Hey, not much.  We've heard everyone in O-Town is tough, so bring it on.  Yeah, man.  I'm Jack, man.  I'll take you all on.  Yeah.  I just want to call and, like, wish Jimmy a happy birthday, man.  Thanks, man.  It's not his birthday.  Do you call the people that you assault down there in O-Town because he's such a tough guy?  Do you call them guests?  No.  I run around with bandanas tied around the space shuttle.  Are you a cast member? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  You know, at Disney, they're not employees and, you know, people coming to the park.  They're guests in O-Town.  Universal, man.  I forget about that stuff.  Universal is the real thing, man.  It's, like, West Coast, East Coast.  It's, like, the mouse, and then there's, like, Woody Woodpecker, man.  Oh, you were at Universal?  Yeah.  No, I don't work at any of those.  Oh, I thought that's what he said.  What do you do in O-Town?  I go to school, but I'm from Boston originally.  I just moved down here, like, a year ago. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  Right on.  Cool.  Hey, take care, man.  All right.  Thank you.  Have a great day, little Jimmy.  Thanks, buddy.  Later, fuckers.  They do that in some ways, dude.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  It's not his birthday.  Had a little thing at the garden yesterday.  Audio from his Saturn last night. 
[00:11:00]  Happy birthday, big dick daddy.  Now I'll blow out your candle.  Jim in New York.  What's up, Jim?  Hey, fellas.  Good morning.  Morning, little Jimmy.  Happy birthday, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Hey, guys.  I think I'm missing you obvious.  Jimmy, you got some new drill bits there?  Yeah.  I think they meant to send you new bits for the show.  Ooh.  Oh.  That's going to hurt.  All right, fellas.  I'm punching out.  Awful wordplay thing.  Look at the Mary Carrey masturbator box. 
[00:11:30]  Her picture on it, she's got her tits laid out over a sweater.  And then the sweater is covering kind of a world to hurt.  You think?  Yeah, she's a little thick.  I love it.  Well, that's why I think this vag is a little...  Hopefully no one used it.  It's just something's going on here.  I would definitely bang that.  You would?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, a little lonely night.  Absolutely.  A little night where the finances might not jive with the hookers.  Yes, right.  You'd have to send them home. 
[00:12:00]  The heart says yes, but the wallet says no.  Right.  Let me stick my finger in that rubber snatch.  There you go.  And by finger, I mean cock.  All right.  Wow, she's got something going on there, right?  Accurate representation of her snatch.  She's got something going on with the flaps.  Ooh.  Man, let me put my...  You might be able to fuck that.  Yeah, absolutely. 
[00:12:30]  That might feel good.  You feel it, Jimmy?  I did in the office.  Uh-oh.  But I'd like it again.  It's got two holes at the end for cleaning purposes.  Oh, my God.  That is what that's for.  So you can get the water.  You shove the faucet in there and let her rip.  Watch egg drop soup come out of the other end.  Jesus.  Horrible.  Like a good blackjack, too.  A little embarrassing when you clock someone over the head, but this thing's got some weight to it.  You can knock someone out with that. 
[00:13:00]  It's like a stretch Armstrong that you can fuck.  Wow, that's good.  Let's take it, Jimmy.  And I think if you...  It's like a mouth.  You lay it on a Dondi comic.  You can then stretch it and have fun making his face move.  Let's say hi to LD in California.  Looks like Jabba's mouth, doesn't it?  Hey, guys.  Hey, it's Lippy.  Fuck Liddy.  Lippy.  Go with Lippy for the rest of the day.  LD, what's up?  Not much, boys.  How's it going?  Hey. 
[00:13:30]  Hey, little Jimmy.  How you doing?  Better now.  Yeah, I just wanted to ask you guys what you thought about this podcasting thing.  I mean, I've been playing around with the iTunes things that they added the podcasting to it.  I was wondering if you thought if someone like, if one of the pets like Dougout Doug started doing a podcast that possibly, that if people started going with that, it could be like that nightmare scenario you guys have been talking about where the pets turn on you for their own shows.  Podcasting is just a phase. 
[00:14:00]  It's a fad that would quickly go away, replaced by television and radio.  I guess podcasting is happening, and it's kind of an interesting concept, sure.  Yeah, I mean, I've done a couple of podcasts, and honestly, I mean, I listen to myself back on the thing, and I honestly think I sound like a gay daffy duck.  Where do you, how do you record it, sir?  The problem with podcasting is most of it just is awful. 
[00:14:30]  It just stinks.  It absolutely just stinks.  People doing their own little radio show.  Right.  Then they upload it, and you can download it onto your iPod and listen to a very bad version of a college radio show.  Exactly.  Well, I do not disagree.  I mean, honestly, I sound like I should have black feathers wearing a bathrobe and coughing a lot.  Well, 15 minutes.  Well, we have an idea to give an hour or two of this fine channel to our pests, so stay tuned for more info on that. 
[00:15:00]  Okay.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks for really boring up the show this early in the morning.  Usually, we never recover, so thank you.  We'll blame it on you, LB.  Good job.  Good job to you.  Let's say hi to Jim in Chicago.  Jim, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  All right.  I think Bob and Tom should be giving a golden ticket.  You guys are the best, but for a second runner-up, I think they're right there.  Uh-oh.  Well, the deal is we have decided to give out five golden tickets. 
[00:15:30]  We have decided to save five radio shows from that awful, dead commercial radio.  Oh, yeah.  We have given out our first golden ticket to our pals, our friends, Ron and Fez.  And I think we're going to do a show with them like a week from today, just to give you guys  a little taste of what's called an Afro show.  Who wouldn't want to come here and do a show without those pesky breaks to take a leak, get 
[00:16:00]  something to eat, have sex?  I've listened to the Ron and Fez show before, and they're, I think, pretty good.  They're very funny, but I got some beef with those guys.  You got beef with Ron and Fez?  No, I was just trying to be intriguing for the show.  Oh, a little controversy.  I think people would go, what kind of controversy?  A little wrestling storyline?  Yeah, maybe Fez holds me down, shows me who's boss.  Again?  Okay, well, that was all I had.  Punching out.  Well, here's the problem.  We got five golden tickets.  We gave one away, so we got four left. 
[00:16:30]  Four left.  Someone has to alert the media.  This is a very, very big story in the radio world.  Yes.  That Opie and Anthony are going to do good for once, and they're going to save five shows  from awful commercial radio.  Rescue.  And then the rest of them go on the fucko list.  Fucko list.  Yeah.  I was reading about the fucko list.  A lot of people commenting on it.  And Steve is working on a promo about the fucko list and the golden tickets, but we have  to alert the media, man, and tell them this is what's going on.  You think they're going to print the fucko list? 
[00:17:00]  I'm sure they will.  It's news.  Yeah, it's news.  Why not?  Opie and Anthony are going to save five shows total, and the rest go on the fucko list.  But we have to be fair.  That guy brings up Bob and Tom.  I've heard some Bob and Tom over the years, and I'm not impressed whatsoever.  No.  And I know that's going to be a shock to a lot of truckers out there, because I'm sure  they've heard a lot of Bob and Tom over the years.  A little too regional?  Well, maybe, I don't know how we're going to do this, because we want to be fair.  Maybe the listeners start sending in bits of their favorite commercial radio show, so 
[00:17:30]  we can be completely fair about this before we decide if you're worthy of getting a golden  ticket, or if you should be put on the fucko list right.  And quite honestly, I haven't heard Bob and Tom in many, many years, so I don't know what  they've been up to.  Jimmy, have you ever done the Bob and Tom show when you're promoting your gigs?  No, I've never.  Never?  I've never done a lot of shows.  Yeah?  Yeah.  You have a few friends you drop in on?  I love doing certain ones, but the rest, especially since we came back, I've got to do them in 
[00:18:00]  certain markets that we were never on in before.  Oh, it's just, it's penance.  How do you control the cursing?  I don't even try to be, I'm so used to coming in here and just being honest and talking like  we talk, and I mean, I guess they have a show to do, so they want you to be funny,  but I don't want to go on and do bits.  I can't do it.  I just can't.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's funny you should say that, because on the flight today, really?  What happened on the flight today?  Yeah, you don't want to be going through your material.  It's just awful.  Quite frankly, it would be very difficult for you to do your stuff. 
[00:18:30]  Could I say doo-doo instead of heck?  Well, we need a criteria, Anthony.  We need to figure this all out.  We've got a big responsibility here to give out these golden tickets.  Saving people.  We're saving people from commercial radio.  We're life givers.  I'd rather just throw everyone on the fuck-o list personally, but...  Everyone?  And everyone wants a peek at my fuck-o list.  I'm not giving it up anytime soon.  I saw it yesterday. 
[00:19:00]  You saw it?  Well, it's our fuck-o list.  I just happen to hold it.  And you know what happened?  All the message boards, they want a peek at the fuck-o list.  I can't.  I would lose the fuck-o list in a second.  If somebody wanted to come on the show, and you weren't sure, you'd go,  you want something, fuck-o?  And then you could hit them in the bridge of the nose with your pistol.  All right, so we've got to figure this out, because we're getting a lot of email.  Now, people are going, dude, could you give a golden ticket out to Jimmy, Bob, and Omelette? 
[00:19:30]  Like, these shows I've never heard of is what I'm getting at.  So why would we just give out a golden ticket to a show we've never heard of?  So somehow, if you're that dedicated to this show on commercial radio,  you've got to give us a little taste, a little sample, all right?  And then we'll go from there.  How's that sound?  Very good.  Bob A. from Boston.  This golden ticket is bullshit.  Why don't you tell the truth?  The only reason why you're doing this is because you're getting shit for ratings during your replays. 
[00:20:00]  It's a bad sign, guys.  Don't bullshit us.  Could someone get Elo on, or the actor that plays Elo, please?  I'm not Elo, but I play him on the radio.  Please, get Elo on.  There's proofs that they're now failing in satellite as well,  just like they failed in commercial radio.  Shut up.  We do seem to be the most talked about failures ever.  Ever, right?  And there are no ratings for replays. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if it works.  And let me throw this out.  Who said that all the golden tickets that we give out are going to be shows that end up on 202?  Nobody.  Right.  Could we possibly be controlling another channel in the near future?  Boys, girls, and sluts out there?  CEO Bob at Hotmail.com.  Let's say hi to Andy in Ohio.  Andy, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you? 
[00:21:00]  Real good.  Good.  Hey, I want to hear that Phenomenal song again.  Oh, what a hit this was.  Yeah, it was great.  People love the Phenomenal song.  I didn't care for it.  I think it painted me as if I were an ass.  I absolutely loved it.  There were a couple things on yesterday's show I absolutely loved.  There were three, actually.  The Phenomenal song.  I loved the Greaseman.  It had me laughing really, really, really hard.  He did a little appearance on the show yesterday.  Greaseman hoping and wanting a golden ticket. 
[00:21:30]  Yes, he did.  And not getting it in his email.  He was looking, though.  That made me laugh really hard yesterday.  And then, believe it or not, the olive jokes.  Yeah, that was funny.  Because it was classic Opie and Anthony where we take a really good idea and just run it into the ground.  Don't just plow it deep.  Stupid Ben comes in and goes, I really liked today's show.  I was speaking yesterday.  I really liked today's show, but I thought the last segment went a little long.  A little long. 
[00:22:00]  That was the best segment of the day because it went a little long.  And remember the old days at N.E.W.?  That was a quickie.  That's right.  That was a quick bit.  Would you go longer in N.E.W.?  Oh, the whole show was dedicated to that.  We would have done the whole, yeah, the bit all day long.  You'd have heard four hours of that bad piano and retard babbling.  Let's say hi to Tony on Long Island.  Tony, what's up?  I got a nap, Joe.  Bye.  All right. 
[00:22:30]  Okay.  Oh, wait.  I need the setup, don't I?  Shit.  All right, hold on.  I'll be.  I'm not prepared yet.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't get scared.  Everything's under control here.  Everything's at the door.  And now he hung up.  Now, I'm set for him.  Oh, what a dick.  Actually, let's do the phenomenal thing for Jimmy Norton here.  Someone requested this. 
[00:23:00]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Do you ever look back, and again, I know I do, when you look back on something you feel  great about, when you look back on it, you go, oh, what the fuck was I thinking?  Yeah, I'm still doing that.  I'm still doing that.  I'm doing that with Sabbath stuff.  There's one song, Who Are You?  Phenomenal. 
[00:23:30]  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  And you know, there's always got to be one buzzkill in life, and I've got to just really  quick address the post.  A guy named Dan Acvalante.  I want to strike him out in his face.  He gave me a trance on Sabbath, where Ozzy created horror with his cringe-inducing vocals.  Ozzy sounded phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal.  Phenomenal. 
[00:24:00]  Bravo, man.  How good is that?  That is great.  That is really good.  That's from the henchmen.  And that's the type of thing we would do, maybe, if we get a listener show together,  or a Pest radio show together, on the weekends or something, on 202.  We would just play all this stuff that comes in from the listeners, give them full credit,  but maybe invite some of these guys in to help intro the stuff, and play DJ.  Who knows?  But I think the Pests have deserved some time on this channel. 
[00:24:30]  A little time.  They send in some funny shit.  That's right.  Let's say hi to Bobby Bigrigger.  Bobby!  Hey, I want to do a knock-knock, guys.  All right.  Let's try this.  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I love the smell of napalm in the morning.  Punching out.  You can't.  Someone is saying, you can't punch out here.  Let this guy say it.  Right.  Exactly.  Because he's right.  Huddle a huddle up from whackbag.com. 
[00:25:00]  What's up?  Good morning, boys.  Doesn't anyone have a real name anymore?  Huddle a huddle.  I know.  Whack bag.  And the thread last night for the olive jokes?  Forget it.  It was going on for four in the morning.  It was fantastic.  Really?  Fantastic.  Oh, it was fantastic.  I posted about 20 myself.  It was fantastic.  Do-do-do-do-do.  Fantastic.  Listen, the only problem I have, we're going to do these different ticket shows.  We need to educate the listeners. 
[00:25:30]  Punching out means saying what you say and hecking up.  No response.  You punch out before the plane crashes.  Old listeners will know this.  The new listeners are driving me fucking crazy.  You punch out.  You say what you've got to say.  Punch the fuck out and leave.  Leave it alone.  That is not entirely correct, sir.  What are you saying?  That is not entirely correct.  Punching out comes from a fighter pilot. 
[00:26:00]  What he does when his plane is crashing, there is no hope of recovery.  His engines are out.  Whatever it is, he is crashing toward the ground.  What does he do before he hits the ground?  He ejects.  He punches out of the plane.  Yesterday, we had a prime example.  Somebody called up, completely muffed his line.  He said, I got an olive thing.  Olive, the, the, the, the, uh, and then he went punching out. 
[00:26:30]  He left the aircraft because he saw there was no hope.  You can't say a line, have it bomb, and then punch out.  Well, yes, you can.  No, you can't.  You're already in a big crater, a flaming crater.  You rode the plane down to the ground.  You didn't leave before it crashed.  That's how it works.  You can say what you want to say and then punch out because your response to the joke is the crash.  Learn it.  No.  Yes, it is. 
[00:27:00]  Dude, I invented the punch out here on the program.  It's not yours anymore, though, Anthony.  They took it and ran with it.  It's mine.  I know how it's supposed to be used.  You know what?  You don't even use your own personality on the radio anymore.  No.  Your listeners have controlled how you, uh, perform now.  Do they?  Did they?  What happened?  Yes, we're just droids.  What happened?  We're just droids.  I got a knock-knock joke.  I don't want a knock-knock joke.  All right.  All right.  Is it one of the better ones that was on, uh, whackbag.com?  Absolutely.  All right. 
[00:27:30]  Knock-knock.  Who's there?  Olive.  Olive who?  I love the big bump in Ben's pants.  Catch it up.  Hey, you guys want to hear something really cool?  What?  Huh?  That's on your iPod?  Are you listening to that?  No, I just, it's on my iPod, but I found it. 
[00:28:00]  I can't even look at you.  All right, OG.  Leave him alone.  A little Jenny from the block.  Right.  Yeah, sure.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, what's up?  You're on the Opie and Anthony program.  How much?  How y'all doing?  Pretty good, buddy.  Uh, I've got someone to nominate for the, uh, golden ticket.  Uh, you know Russ Martin?  Russ Martin is on the fuck-o list.  Oh, is he?  Let me make that perfectly clear, just in case you didn't hear.  Russ Martin is on the fuck-o list. 
[00:28:30]  What's wrong with Russ?  The guy couldn't even say hi to us when we went down to Dallas.  The guy's a douchebag.  Oh, no shit.  Screw him.  Screw Russ Martin and his stupid show in Dallas, fuck-o.  He's on the fuck-o list.  Trust me.  He will be one of the many that has to sit there on commercial radio and suffer as it dies.  It's been a couple of years.  What?  It's probably been a couple of years since I've listened to him.  Well, ever since I've had XM, but I used to listen to him all the time. 
[00:29:00]  Some of these guys, you suggest, immediately we just know they're on the fuck-o list, and Russ Martin is certainly one of them.  All right, yo.  All right.  Have a good one.  Shows that have potential.  So B.J. Shea in Seattle, there's one.  Our boy, Brother Weez, if we could get him out of a damn contract in Rochester, New York.  There you go.  There's some potentials.  Yep.  Russ Martin, fuck-o list.  Fuck-o.  I did a show in...  I did a show in, I think it was Pittsburgh, actually, that was really the most fun I've had on commercial radio in a long time. 
[00:29:30]  I wish I could remember their names.  Really?  Yeah.  They were really great.  Should we tune into some radio today, boys and girls?  If someone's got something good and it works.  Anthony, explain.  We love this bit, but we haven't been able to get it off the ground yet.  You've got to call up when they're in the midst of a wacky bit, and your phone has to be good.  You have to hold it the right distance from the speaker, and then also be listening so we can give you input if it's working or not. 
[00:30:00]  And then you've got to shut up.  It's so complicated for the, how could I put it, retards that listen to this show.  I had to think of a way to put it nicely.  Yeah.  Well, we could give it a shot, because we do have these golden tickets.  Four to go.  Oh, here's one.  Evil Trucker from Dallas.  Go ahead, Evil Trucker.  What's going on, fellas?  Hey.  I've got two nominations for you, Oak. 
[00:30:30]  For the gold list.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I've got to write today's fuck-o list.  Fuck-o list.  Oh, in red today.  That's right.  Wow.  Ooh.  All right.  Go ahead.  For the gold list, Liz Wilde.  If you've ever heard of her, she's pretty good.  And for the fuck-o list, Lycus definitely has to be on it.  And we already added Tom Lycus to the fuck-o list.  He's done, in our eyes.  Liz Wilde. 
[00:31:00]  Liz.  Is she bad?  I've never heard of her.  Opie, who is she?  We replaced Liz in Boston.  Yeah, she was doing afternoons.  We came rolling in.  She left.  We popped in.  And we made everyone forget about Liz Wilde in the Boston area.  Yeah.  And ever since, she's been, her or her cohorts have been kissing our asses.  She's like the radio chick on crack. 
[00:31:30]  I love saying that.  You know, something and then on crack.  Yeah.  It's so funny when people do that.  From hell is funny, too.  Like, ah, it was the babysitter from hell.  From hell.  Do we have to start a third list?  What's that?  Cunts and radio.  Jesus.  Cunts and radio.  Radio cunts.  I like that.  That was going to be my line of the day, right there, and you blew it.  How'd I blow it?  You talked right over me.  I didn't.  I'm really sad now.  You said you had to make a list.  No, actually, a list of people that just might not have enough talent to come to satellite radio. 
[00:32:00]  Because, like, fuck a list of people that we just hate.  Yeah.  Not enough talent.  Okay.  Start with everybody in radio and then just pick off.  Yeah, because we're the only ones that know how to do that.  That's right, Robin.  Tell them, Fred.  Woo-hoo.  Eric Logan, everybody.  There he is.  Actually, it's the actor that plays Eric Logan.  Yeah, I was going to say, make sure we're clear.  It's not really me.  Because, you know, Eric Logan himself is not talented enough to get on a radio show. 
[00:32:30]  No, but I am on the fuck-o list.  No, you're not.  No, you're not.  I'm on some people's fuck-o list, trust me.  You're on the good egg list.  Aw, thank you, Jimmy.  Happy birthday, by the way, buddy.  Oh, thank you, Mr. Logan.  Elo, so how drunk were you when you came up with that Blink format?  Oh, well, we're off to a rearing start.  I wish I had that crash at the plate at this point.  He's a mover, shaker, and a chance taker.  It was a moment of innovation in which we were trying to reinvent radio, guys. 
[00:33:00]  Let's take...  With pink logos.  That was wonderful.  ...some of the concepts from a television show and bring it to radio.  All the fun without those pesky pictures.  You know, pink is the new black.  That was what we kept telling ourselves.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did people tell you the logo for Blink looked like a tampon box?  That was after we put it on the side of every bus in Manhattan.  Oh, yeah, we saw it. 
[00:33:30]  You know, you don't have the rage I used to feel walking in a tough crowd and just seeing  that on the side of the bus on 10th Avenue.  It was very wounding.  And what was the logo, the slogan, Blink?  Well, you might miss it.  You might miss it.  Didn't that not make any sense?  That's true.  That was what it was.  It was supposed to be a double entendre.  Yeah, but Blink...  Blink or you'll miss it.  And I think the actual, the revised version was Blink and you did miss it.  See, but it seems like it's so bad that even if you blink, you've just missed the whole 
[00:34:00]  thing.  Like, who cares?  You miss it in a blink.  So you didn't want owls listening to your radio station?  No.  No owls.  Well, snakes actually blink, so I guess they'll get ahead to snakes.  Because they asked too many questions, who's playing today?  Who thought up this shit?  And they turn their head all the way around and see who's coming up behind them.  And how much did you guys spend on the launch party?  Oh, the launch party, that was a highlight of the format. 
[00:34:30]  I mean, as I always like to say, that was a radio station that was really a party that  just happened to continue to go on the air.  But it was $600,000 to $700,000.  Isn't it great when the opening salvo party is the highlight and it's all downhill from  there?  Oh, man, that was a party, though, I have to tell you.  And then I remember waking up the next morning with my wife and I looked at her and I said,  she goes, what's wrong?  I go, are you listening to the station?  She goes, yeah.  I go, we got a problem.  You knew the next day? 
[00:35:00]  Come on.  One day in.  I woke up the next morning and I turned it on and I went, uh-oh.  I had the same conversation when I got married.  That's true, actually.  The very next morning.  Oh, no, I think there's a problem here.  At that point, you're fully committed.  You've got $600,000, yeah, $600,000, a party.  You've got pink buses driving down the cities of Manhattan.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, that's when we had a problem.  We had to figure out how to make it work.  So then we hired, we went out and hired some gunners. 
[00:35:30]  We got our friend Steve Kingston, got him involved.  Oh, yeah.  Good old Kingston.  Yeah, he's a good egg, too, Jimmy.  Who?  Kingston.  I never met him.  He's a cock blocker.  He's a good egg.  I never met him.  Why, are we hiring him?  No, not at all.  Good.  Steve's good, because...  He's a good...  Listen, guys, I don't hire people for the platform anymore.  I simply just call you to make sure that whoever's on the Opie list there is...  No, it's called the fuck-o list.  The golden ticket list and the fuck-o list. 
[00:36:00]  Are we alerting the media that we're saving four more shows from commercial radio?  Well, I think we're saving three more shows, and you have the Pest show, which I personally think...  Well, no, we don't want to just hand a golden ticket to the Pest yet.  They have to earn it?  We're not really sure yet, is what we're saying.  Of course.  Yes, but I think that, you know, somebody...  One of the instant feedback guys, Anthony, that sent some stuff to you about the fact  that the ratings are bad, and that's the reason why we're doing this, is, you know, 
[00:36:30]  he is more off his rocker than the other guy was, because that is absolutely not the case  at all.  Thank you, Elo.  Yeah, look, I mean, you can get so many versions of this show versus all these Pests that record  this thing and put them up on, you know, hundreds of websites.  You can get the show pretty much any time you want it, how you want it, and it has nothing  to do with ratings or replays or anything, because at the end of the day, ratings really  don't matter, you know, to us.  It matters if the subscriptions that people keep signing up for, they're there. 
[00:37:00]  That's all that matters.  So the ratings matter, though, in the beginning of the day?  Absolutely.  Yeah, absolutely.  What about the middle?  Not the middle, no.  But I assure you this, the fact that Ron and Fez are coming to 202, and the fact that you  have other golden tickets have nothing, zero, to do with the ratings.  Very good.  There you go.  Right from the horse's mouth, as they say.  The horse's mouth or the horse's ass. 
[00:37:30]  Ah, now the horse's mouth.  Elo, big story today.  Hey, uh, Palmeiro.  Steroids.  What's your take on it?  Ah.  He knew it was coming.  You didn't get him.  What?  You didn't get him, did you?  I wasn't going to get him.  That's a big story today.  You hung up on him.  Oh, you were just grabbing for something else.  No, he hung up on us.  No, I know, he did.  He got paranoid.  Oh, he did.  Oh, he did.  But I really wanted his take on it, because, you know, I was thinking that he runs this 
[00:38:00]  whole thing.  Maybe he could get us a baseball player on today to talk about Palmeiro.  Why would we get a, oh, baseball's the next time.  I forgot about that.  Right, yes.  On 176, home plate.  Right?  176?  Yes.  I don't know how you remember those numbers.  I drive, I'm looking for something.  I'm Rain Man, bro.  I'm getting classical music, I'm getting deep tracks of jazz, I'm punching numbers in, I'm  trying to look at the road.  It's just awful.  I have the worst memory.  And I got presets, but only so many. 
[00:38:30]  Pretty rough.  I'm mad that he hung up on us.  That doesn't matter.  He got us.  I'm adding him to the fuck-o list.  You can't put Elo on the fuck-o list.  He's already saved.  You can't boot people back to regular radio.  But that's all it takes to piss me off.  All right, we should take a break and we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony program.  We'll go to break with this. 
[00:39:00]  Right.  If you really want to get into this.  Yeah, we're sorry.  It was stupid.  It was morally wrong.  Bar our, because I'm the Opie and Anthony show.  I'm on the, I'm on the, that's bad.  The, um, the word.  I, I, I would have never, eh, try again.  Chinks niggers.  So, uh, I give the, incident, incidents, uh, you know, show with you, with you guys.  We understand, well, and not because it's, it's, and, and, and, on the, on the, the, or, well, I mean, we were just, what I want to say was, uh. 
[00:39:30]  I, I, I, uh, oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.  So, uh, shut up.  I mean, you know, it's, it's, you know you're a hack.  You got to put some, uh, headphones on.  That's, that's what radio is all about.  Hey, whoa, I like what they had, uh, uh, um, this, uh, this, uh, hey, hey, how the, the people, uh, uh, he's, I don't know. 
[00:40:00]  Oh, yeah.  Can I tell you about fucking mumbling, stuttering, little fuck, you know that?  That's pretty cool sounding.  That was great.  Like sand through the hourglass.  So is the Oaday virus.  You think you could handle a cinnamon roll?  Sure.  I don't know where, uh, the other guy gets him, whatever his name is.  Well, can he get...  Is his name Danny? 
[00:40:30]  Can he get a, uh, an egg white sandwich at the same place that has the cinnamon rolls?  Uh-oh.  Yeah?  Oh, my God, you're sending him out for something else?  I'm hungry today.  Egg whites.  And I need some fat-free milk and a...  Oh, my God.  A spoon.  Pulls out his little Columbo pad.  Shot down his notes on.  Oh, forget it.  Cinnamon roll.  Dude, this is a whole...  This is a whole process.  Can't we do it during the break?  Yeah.  This is not just a quick food order.  We have to explain in detail. 
[00:41:00]  What?  Cinnamon roll's easy?  What do you want?  Oh, boy.  Jim has absolutely no confidence in Ricky.  No.  Jim comes in.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Like, I need coffee.  I'm like, oh, Ricky Gefferny's like, absolutely not.  Where's Danny?  Takes Danny right off the phones.  Danny's answering the phones.  No.  No.  Well, I think...  I want some skim milk and a banana.  Skim milk and a banana.  And a spoon.  Ben, where do we get egg whites?  On, like, a bagel.  On a good bagel?  Like an everything bagel? 
[00:41:30]  Don't deal with that place downstairs.  There's food.  Egg whites.  Egg whites.  Now, here's...  After you have that written down, here's the issue with my cinnamon roll.  Okay.  Oh, God.  I don't know where these places are that these people get these cinnamon rolls.  I don't know where they are.  But one that I get sometimes is it's hard and nasty.  We don't want the hard, nasty, old, stale ones.  They're right there.  I like a cushy, fresh cinnamon roll that's spongy. 
[00:42:00]  Just give it a little squeeze.  Not with your fingers.  You want the cinnamon roll...  You can tell by looking at it.  You want the cinnamon roll to feel like 18-year-old boobs.  Ooh.  Yes.  You don't want it to feel like breast implants.  You don't have to look at it.  You can tell by looking at dog crap on the street if it's old and dry and flaky.  Or if it's nice, cushy, and soft.  Give it a little poke.  Now, that doesn't mean bring back dog crap, either. 
[00:42:30]  It might do that.  You're crazy, Fergie.  No, I won't.  Just poke it, Fergie.  Don't poke it, Jimmy.  Shut up about fucking poking.  He has to.  Remember the time he put his nail into your apple and you lost your mind, you lunatic.  I'm with Jimmy.  I think you need to take your index finger and give it just a little...  No, there's no poking my cinnamon roll.  Just a little poke.  Wash your hands first.  No.  Wash your hands.  Wash your hands.  Just a little poke.  A poke where Anthony wouldn't even know that you actually poked it.  You mother fucker. 
[00:43:00]  No.  Just a little like this.  Look, just a little...  Just like that.  Just to see if it...  Don't be poking.  Just to see if it kind of pushes in a little bit and then comes right back out.  All right, Ricky, get out of here.  Toby and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  Someone get in the best, the best, the best, the best of you.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you. 
[00:43:30]  Has someone skinned your face?  It's real, the pain you feel.  You trust, you must get past.  Is someone getting the best, the best, the best, the best of you.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony program,  the Onei virus spreading across America.  Thank you to XM Satellite Radio for seeing it our way.  We greatly appreciate it.  On our phone lines is Bruce Kelly from the 80s channel.  Bruce, what's going on, buddy? 
[00:44:00]  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Pretty good.  What do you got?  Elo just told me I'm on the fuck-o list.  Come on.  Come on.  Bruce.  Come on.  Why?  If you cry, we'll take you off the fuck-o list.  Absolutely cry.  Play some hoop.  Bruce, you're already on Satellite Radio.  Yeah, see, the golden tickets are for people stuck in broadcast radio.  All right.  What are you doing on your show today? 
[00:44:30]  What am I what?  What are you doing on your show today?  Culture Club.  Right now?  Duran Duran.  Yeah.  They got a new tour coming out, don't they?  Yeah, yeah.  Are you plugging that?  No, no.  I'm out on the road with Journey this week.  Journey?  Yeah.  What's going to be your big speaking break today on your show?  My morning dedication to you, Ope.  I know.  You do that a lot.  Oh, yeah.  It's kind of creepy.  What song do you want to hear today?  It's 80s, right? 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  One night in Bangkok.  Ugh.  Jesus.  Wang Chung tonight.  Hey, by the way, I saw the promos for Jimmy on HBO.  When is his thing, Ron?  They're airing at last.  It looks like October 19th to 21st.  I'm not sure of the exact date.  They put you first in the promo.  Oh, okay.  That's cool.  Just to get out of the way, I guess.  Move this fat face along.  Hey, Bruce, could you send a song, From Me to Ope? 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  It's a friend's song.  It's like, me and my buddies would do stuff like this.  Do you have open arms by turning?  By the way, I've always wanted to do this.  Oh, no.  You can't just, you can't openly say you want to do it and then hang out.  No, you got to ask something, and then when we're all eager to answer, then hang out.  I wanted to ask Bruce, because he knows a lot of, like, bands.  I wanted to hang out with him in some bands.  He hangs out with a lot of people.  I know he does.  Bruce knows everybody.  Yeah, I need some backstage passes to Queen. 
[00:46:00]  What?  Not for myself.  Trust me.  I'm doing a friend a favor.  For Queen?  What are they playing?  Actually, I'll tell you who it is.  It's Joey.  Really?  Joey Paisano.  Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Better come across with those.  Yeah, Brian Maypie owes him money.  He's about to collect.  I forgot that Joey was a hardcore Queen fan, right?  Yeah.  And I guess Queen is getting together with Paul Rogers.  I think it's Paul Rogers who's going to do the Freddie Mercury thing. 
[00:46:30]  Wow.  But I'm thinking Queen without Freddie Mercury.  There's some bands without the lead singer.  Personally, it's not worth going to see.  Absolutely.  You've really got to be good to step into somebody like that.  The Doors without Jim Morrison.  Sorry.  It's just a whole different band.  You know what I mean?  And I thought Queen, yeah, and people are going to argue this point.  Brian May.  Brian May!  All right, I get it.  Brian May was great, too.  But, I mean, Freddie Mercury was just, in my opinion, the whole band.  Yeah.  Of course he was. 
[00:47:00]  So they're getting together to do what?  Like two shows, one on the West Coast and one on the East Coast, and Joey's going.  Joey spent like, what did he tell me the other day, like $6,000 on two tickets?  No, he didn't.  He's up close, and I'm like, why?  But he's that much of a fan.  But it's not Queen.  It's not.  Are they hard to get tickets?  It's a hot ticket, right, Steve?  Why?  He's dead.  Like Freddie Mercury, without Brian May, would still be Queen. 
[00:47:30]  Sure would be.  You get somebody else in there.  Very, I know, very distinct guitar sound and style.  This is just the first time it's hitting the States.  They've been doing this overseas for a while now.  I think it's over a year now.  Do me a favor.  Just hum Sail Away, Sweet Sister.  Sail Away.  I don't know how that one goes.  Of course you do.  I really don't.  Do we have it?  Anyway.  Sorry, Jim.  Yeah, Paul Rogers.  Well, what did he say?  He sang in Bad Company, and he sang in Free, I think.  Free, right?  I mean, you know, he's got enough of a following on his own.  Granted, not as big as... 
[00:48:00]  Wasn't he in The Firm?  Was he?  One of those super groups.  But he's got enough of a following on his own.  Not as much as Queen's is, but, you know, they're drawing huge crowds.  And yeah, it's going to be a hard ticket, Jimmy.  So weird.  So I've got to get backstage.  Maybe Bruce Kelly can help us out with that.  Oh, boy.  Here's Bruce Kelly crying.  Is this live?  Yes, we're live.  Bruce, where were you, buddy?  I was right up under these photogs.  Bruce Kelly is a complete tool.  I was all right.  I'm sorry.  I'm absolutely crying.  I can't help it.  I really can't. 
[00:48:30]  This is no fake.  You know, the whole moment just kind of...  Kind of got me.  Fucking cry, baby.  It was just...  I mean, you know, it's just a who.  You know, I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with a who.  And that's it.  You can't cry.  There's no crying at satellite radio.  Sorry.  Oh, please.  It's very awkward.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[00:49:00]  As a man, that is so tough to listen to.  I can't help but be a 14-year-old kid out there with a who.  That's it.  Sorry.  Fucking cry, baby.  I'd be crying if I had to watch the who, too, but for different reasons.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Sorry.  I'm sorry.  Because you're a faggot, all right?  There you go.  That's from Harry T. 
[00:49:30]  One of our own.  Put that together with the crying audio.  I actually worked with...  That was Jay Black singing.  Right?  Jay Black and the Americans.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I worked with him once at West Bride Music Fair.  I'm pretty sure.  No, wasn't it the dude with the dark sunglasses?  Yeah.  Jay Black.  Roy Orbison, maybe?  Oh, all right.  I thought it was Jay Black.  Well, then there goes that fun story.  There goes 20 minutes.  It had black in it, Black Sabbath.  I could see how you might have...  I never worked with Black Sabbath.  Yeah, I just talked to him.  They're my friends.  Scotty in Iowa.  What's up, Scotty?  Hey, top of the morning, boys. 
[00:50:00]  Top of the morning to you, Scotty.  Hey, listen.  I put a little thought into this whole golden ticket thing, and I don't know if you guys  can quite follow this, but you've just got to kind of hear me out here.  I think I got something.  Oh, boy.  I'm thinking we'd take these four tickets.  I don't know, like put them in like a chocolate candy bar, and then we have little Jimmy Norton  play the fat German kid.  Opie, you're going to be the little cowboy kid.  He should have punched out.  Let's go to Brad in Ohio.  He should have punched out of that call.  Hey, buddy.  What's up, Brad?  Hey, I got a nomination for you. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Ron and Fizz's buddies, The Hideout.  F-A-N-J-Dub.  What's The Hideout?  They're the show that comes after that shit dick out of Orlando, Florida the day it's  hacked.  They used to be on JFK.  Guys, here's the problem, because we're getting a ton of email from all over the country now,  because we're dead serious about this golden ticket thing.  We're going to save a total of five shows from that awful commercial radio.  We've handed out the first golden ticket to Ron and Fizz. 
[00:51:00]  We're thinking of giving a golden ticket to the listeners, give them their own show on  the weekends.  But we don't know any of these shows.  No.  We have to hear them.  That's the beauty of satellite radio.  That's why everyone wants to go to satellite radio, because then you're heard all over  the country, and then you get the exposure, and people get to hear you all over.  And freedom.  I've never heard of The Hideout.  I don't know what they do, so to just suggest The Hideout means nothing to us.  Yeah, well, they're on Rio Radio 104.1.  So what do you want me to do, fly down to Orlando so I can check them out? 
[00:51:30]  O-Town, O-Town.  You want me to be like a radio scout, and my whole job is to fly from market to market  trying to find the next hit radio show?  Some of these shows we know from personal experience, but in general, we don't know  what these guys are doing out there.  I'd like to get a tape of the Out to Lunch.  Those guys, they're very supportive of this program from Baltimore.  And if you're going to send in some stuff, one other guy sent me a link to a website  that had thousands of clips. 
[00:52:00]  It's like, where do you even begin?  Make it easy.  Send us good stuff that you think is good, wacky, whatever.  And quick.  If it's a 20, 30-minute bit, guess what?  After 30 seconds, done, delete, into my garbage pail.  And you know what this show is all about.  It's either something that's got to be really good or really, really bad.  Peter in Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  I was just about to suggest The Hideout myself. 
[00:52:30]  They're like the number one homoerotic station channel in the whole country.  It's great.  All right, thanks.  It's annoying because we don't know what that even means.  Paul in Tennessee, what's up?  Hey.  Hey.  Yeah, I got some wacky radio for you.  Oh, really?  Yeah, the Andy and Allison show on WIVK.  Hey, they're doing this whole sing like a pro wrestler thing for wrestling tickets.  All right.  Uh-oh.  Let's listen in.  Yeah, I think they just got off commercial, so. 
[00:53:00]  All right.  Let's see what we got.  All right, well, there you have it.  That's what commercial radio is all about.  That's why we want to save.  We want to save a bunch of shows from commercial radio.  So what?  They're going back into music?  Yeah, they're back into some more country music.  All right.  I hate this stuff, man.  I can't take it.  All right.  Thank you, bro.  Yeah, no problem. 
[00:53:30]  There you have it.  There's some shit out there.  I guess we got to announce that the contest for August has begun for the Assault on the Media.  Oh, what a...  And it started with a bang.  With a bang.  I got this emailed to me last night by Steve.  I've watched it ten times.  Yeah.  I could not stop watching it.  I watched it ten times minimum.  All the features that we have said is a perfect Assault on the Media.  Yes.  The guy was in a wacky suit. 
[00:54:00]  You could hear what he was saying, and he was right there behind the reporter.  Perfect.  The best Assault on the Media for the month of August so far will win a MyFi from MyRadioStore.com,  I believe.  A day with the Opie and Anthony show.  Dinner at Paisano's of Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  And possibly a night at the Comedy Cellar.  I talked to Ava last night.  She's like, yeah, it's great.  Oh, awesome.  Where you could go down there with two or three of your friends and see where Jimmy performs when he's not touring around the country. 
[00:54:30]  It's awesome.  Yeah, Tal's there a lot.  Colin's there a lot.  It's a great...  What's great is a lot of headliners there almost every night of the week, you know, practicing their craft.  It's awesome.  You get to see like eight to ten comedians in an hour and a half.  It's amazing.  Absolutely amazing, the Comedy Cellar.  And they always treat me right.  But a lot of people say, well, dude, you know, we're from all over the country and I don't know when we're going to get to New York next.  We'll figure something out.  The prizes for the month of August will be very, very impressive. 
[00:55:00]  Will they be better than July?  Yes.  Because that seat cushion, I hope, it's going to be hard to top.  I've been promised that the prizes for the contest for August will be much, much better.  So this is what we're doing.  I'm not saying much.  We're doing, you know, this dinner, hang out with the show.  It's better.  Going to a comedy club and a MiFi.  But if you're from like Alabama, because this guy might take it all and he can't make it to New York, then we'll figure out something else.  Trust me.  We'll make it worth your while is what I'm saying. 
[00:55:30]  Okay.  Don't we have enough calls from Alabama that we should have that clip from South Park?  Alabama, man.  Alabama, man.  Of course.  And by the way, we're out of seat cushions, so they've improvised.  We have a brick with an orange sock wrapped around it.  But before I play the one that's in the lead already, the early leader, I want to play Chris from New Jersey.  He got on what?  CBS?  He got on a CBS affiliate in New Jersey.  Jersey representing. 
[00:56:00]  And I want to play this because the guy had a great idea.  The execution stunk.  Really?  Absolutely stunk.  Yeah.  The videos are up on opianthony.com and foundrymusic.com.  But here's Chris's attempt on an assault on the media in Jersey.  Please tell us that at this point, no one has been officially charged.  That's what it's live tonight from Monroe Township, New Jersey.  I'm Jamie Smith, CBS 3.  I want to snooze.  All right.  He had a horn.  That's why I loved this assault on the media. 
[00:56:30]  That is a good idea.  This guy almost hit a home run.  He waited way too long.  The guy was wrapping up.  The guy had like two seconds left live, and then he attacked with an air horn.  He ran past.  He was able to say opianthony or ONA.  He ran past with an air horn.  If you hit the air horn a little earlier, there could have been some fun.  Now, let me.  There could have been some fun is what I'm thinking.  Air horn's rule.  I'm looking at the video.  Air horn's rule.  Don't make a.  Don't make a fucking maniac out of me. 
[00:57:00]  Air horn's rule.  The pests get air horns.  Right.  Coming soon to the Opie and Anthony program, your official XM satellite radio air horn.  Air horn.  Air horn's for everyone.  I'm looking at this now.  I got to give the guy a couple more points.  Because is this guy standing at a police station?  Oh, yeah.  I am seeing five cop cars right behind this reporter.  And he, you know, I'm kind of understanding why he didn't stand there for a while.  Yeah, right.  There's nothing but police cars behind this guy. 
[00:57:30]  All right.  But I think Chris is going to be remembered as the guy that brought the air horn to the  assault on the media.  Great idea.  I like the way the listeners are kind of embracing this, coming up with their own ideas and running  with it.  It's beautiful.  Because, you know, it starts with one air horn.  Next thing you know, there's a lot of air horns.  Imagine a guy trying to do his report.  Opie and Anthony honk.  Opie and Anthony honk.  And it's so obnoxious when you hear those things. 
[00:58:00]  Awful.  You can't play it off.  No.  Some fucking drunk right behind you in an outfit.  I will go on record and say that I think an assault on the media with an air horn equals  another reporter getting fired.  Oh, yeah.  Because he's just going to lose his mind.  You don't keep your cool.  No, not at all.  So, I want to play Chris's.  Does he have a sign or anything?  No, he kind of just runs through, right, with the air horn.  I just wish if he attacked just slightly earlier, it could have been a lot of fun. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  So, Chris, bravo on your effort.  And I do believe a new trend is going to start because of you.  So, congratulations, my friend.  The early leader in the assault on the media contest for the month of August.  Yep.  Simply Lion Man in Alabama.  You want to explain this one, Anthony?  Oh, this guy, brilliant.  Not only does he show up behind the reporter and give out the pertinent information, Opie  and Anthony, XM Satellite Radio, but he is doing it with a sign in his hand and dressed 
[00:59:00]  like a lion.  Like a lion.  I'd love to know where they get these suits, how they get them on, knowing that a live  shot's happening.  I think this guy emailed me, and I think this is something he wears every Halloween.  Oh, really?  Yeah, because it's so awful, and he gets a lot of laughs at his...  It is the worst lion suit ever.  He gets a lot of laughs at his local Halloween party with that suit.  You saw the suit, right?  He doesn't look like a good lion at all. 
[00:59:30]  No, it's like a gummy bear.  And he's in some kind of...  He's kind of running behind a...  His t-shirt is just tight.  Is it a muscle shirt?  It's just awful.  Lion shirt.  Lions don't wear tight shirts.  Or hold signs.  So, the video is up on opanthony.com.  This is very impressive, because this comes from Alabama.  Alabama.  I think the virus is spreading, Anthony.  Need that one.  The virus is spreading.  They're getting involved in Alabama. 
[01:00:00]  Auburn, right?  Auburn, Alabama.  So, here's the audio of that assault on the media.  Later on, if you're in your car right now, go to opanthony.com to check out the video.  It's really funny.  Homemade opanthony.com.  Opin' Anthony XM sign, nice and big.  He's just there all happy in his lion's suits, yelling and screaming, Opin' Anthony.  Here's Dolores, Keith.  Dolores.  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Of course, there are a lot of great reasons why people love Auburn.  Now, most parents with school-aged children love it because of its great public school system. 
[01:00:30]  Satellite Radio.  Satellite Radio out with a funny radio.  Opin' Anthony, Satellite Radio.  Got the whole thing out twice.  And I love how in a lion's suit with the sign, you could completely read Opin' Anthony.  I love how these guys kind of imitate each other, too, because that goes, that's very similar to the one in Springfield, Mass.  Yes.  Cape guy.  Yep.  The same kind of cadence to his voice and stuff. 
[01:01:00]  Here it is again.  The video, of course, up on opin'anthony.com.  Here's Dolores, Keith.  Dolores.  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Of course, there are a lot of great reasons why people love Auburn.  Now, most parents with school-aged children love it because of its great public school system.  And then, of course, write-a-tape.  The lion's suit just makes it, though.  You know, I think that one's going to be really tough to beat. 
[01:01:30]  That's tough to beat because it has all the features we're looking for.  Some guy dressed in something ridiculous.  He's got a great sign that's really visible.  And he got the name and the XM out twice.  How do you casually meander around the site in a lion outfit before they go to a shot?  Yeah, who isn't seeing that coming?  Yeah, because this isn't Old Town.  No.  Where you're used to seeing crap like that.  Alabama.  This is Alabama.  That cameraman was probably picking his feet at the time. 
[01:02:00]  Didn't see the guy in the lion suit.  Just meandering, whistling, looking everywhere but the live shot.  Maybe he had his pocket knife out and a stick and he was a whittling something.  You never know.  I think that outfit stinks so bad he probably didn't recognize it was supposed to be a lion.  I'm like, who is that hairy-faced idiot?  All right, so there you have it.  The early leader.  Assault on the media for the month of August.  That's Stephen the Lion, man.  Tough to beat.  Versus NBC 12 in Auburn, Alabama. 
[01:02:30]  And he wins.  It's very, very exciting to see that the virus is spreading to Alabama.  I like how it's versus the reporter, like it was ever a battle or like she ever had a chance.  When Steve throws these up on the websites, he mentions the TV station, the reporter's name.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, that's a tiger, not a lion?  Oh, silly.  Whatever.  What?  Why does a tiger have kind of a mane then?  Tim in Georgia. 
[01:03:00]  Yo, what's up, boys?  What's up?  It's Chip.  All right, what's up?  Chip.  It's the Auburn Tigers.  It's not a lion, dumbasses.  It's an Auburn Tiger.  Oh, going with the Auburn Tigers thing.  Yeah, that was what the story was about.  Oh, well, then that's brilliant.  You know what, though?  This guy wrote me.  He's calling the show sometime today.  I'm going to go on record and say it's a lion costume.  Then he fucked it up.  Yep.  Where are the stripes?  I don't see any tiger stripes.  It would have made more sense to be a tiger, but I think he had a lion costume on. 
[01:03:30]  Thank you, sir.  Go dogs.  Here's Dolores, Keith.  Dolores.  All right, thanks, Mark.  Of course, there are a lot of great reasons why people love Auburn.  Now, most parents with school-age children love it because of its great public school system.  Can I point out something very subtle?  I don't know if anyone else picked on one.  Did you hear the reporter's voice go up slightly?  A little bit.  She then had to concentrate very hard on what she was saying.  Listen, here's Dolores, Keith. 
[01:04:00]  Dolores.  All right, thanks, Mark.  Of course, there are a lot of great reasons why people love Auburn.  Now, most parents with school-age children love it because of its great public school system.  I now have to really concentrate on what I'm saying.  He threw her for a loop.  That's why we call you guys pests.  She is just so annoyed by that.  You know what could top that?  What we really haven't seen yet, the elusive, in front of the reporter, assault on the media. 
[01:04:30]  A lot of guys right behind the reporter doing things.  Being in front of the reporter would just be despicable.  But, I believe by the end of the month, you'll be listening to this very program on a Wi-Fi.  I truly think in front of the reporter is the way to go.  We have one simple rule.  Do not touch the reporters.  Of course not.  Do not touch the reporters. 
[01:05:00]  Didn't Big Kev do an assault on the media back in the day?  Which one was that?  I think you were the one that had the largest wow ever on an assault on the media.  You held your shirt up?  Yeah.  Why don't you go fuck yourself, Jimmy?  Oh!  Hey!  You can take that to me!  You got balls.  I like that.  You got balls.  It's the world coming to! 
[01:05:30]  I'm sorry, guys.  Were you the guy that put the sign right in front of the reporter?  We had one of those.  We had a guy do that back in the day.  Put the sign in front.  Yeah.  Completely in front of his face.  I was pissed off the reporter.  All right.  Thanks for contributing to the show.  Jesus.  Well, there we go.  I have to have a question for Kevin.  New entrant.  We got Frank from Jersey.  He's the guy that did the air horn thing.  Frank.  Yeah, what's up, guys?  So what's the back story?  We saw that the story took place in a police station parking lot. 
[01:06:00]  We saw five or six cruisers there.  Yeah.  And if you watch the video, you can actually see a cop actually walking into the station  about ten seconds before it happened.  Oh, really?  Oh, and that's what got you all paranoid?  Like, I got to wait for that guy to go inside?  Well, not a matter of paranoid.  My buddy, Chris, who actually sent it in, he may or may not be an insider.  Oh, I see.  Okay.  Well, we don't need to know.  Gotcha.  So there's not a place to hide.  It's a wide open parking lot, and there's not a lot of time to get there from where I 
[01:06:30]  was hiding.  Frank, you have just introduced the air horn to the assault on the media.  Yeah, 12 bucks at Walmart.  12 bucks at Walmart.  There you go.  Sporting good section.  Buffalo Paul right now is running to his local Walmart.  Come on, Buffalo Paul.  You can do it this month.  Yeah, unfortunately, it didn't work out as good as I hoped, but, you know, there's always  more chances.  Honestly, you got our attention today.  I loved it.  That's cool, man.  I loved it.  But Lion Guy, or maybe Tiger Guy, we'll find out later in the show. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, you got to give him props.  He did a much better job, you know?  He's the early leader as far as this assault on the media contest for August goes.  All right, guys.  Frank, good job, buddy.  All right.  Bye, Jimmy.  Bye, Frank.  Thanks for calling the program.  Later, bro.  All right.  There he goes.  I have a horn.  Love your grandson, Frank.  Hank, stop.  You're making noise.  You're spilling it.  You're spilling it.  Let's go to CokeLogic from WhackBag.com. 
[01:07:30]  CokeLogic.  Hello.  What's up, sir?  Hey, I have a new bit of suggestion there.  Oh, boy.  People reading the famous movie line, colors being from Alabama. 
[01:08:00]  Alabama, man.  Exactly.  Not a bad idea.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, buddy.  Appreciate that.  It's not his birthday.  What is it now?  It's like August what?  August 2nd.  See, even Anthony's annoyed.  It's my birthday.  Even Anthony's annoyed.  It's in July.  What is it?  The beginning of July?  When is it?  Oh, the second time.  Ah.  Hey, Jeff.  What's up?  Hey.  The number one movie in the theaters this week, Back to the Future 2. 
[01:08:30]  And he hands up on himself.  Of course he did.  You faggot.  We would have let you do that for an hour if you wanted to.  I think I could have just gone on and on and on.  What, do you think we're going to panic?  Whoa, what is that?  Sorry.  Oh, no.  What happened?  Oh, sorry.  You're the wrong clip guy.  Oh, no.  Look.  Hang up on him.  Oh, God.  You gizbag.  I hope he did that as a gag. 
[01:09:00]  Like, like.  I know.  Don't you think it's got to be like a parody of the whole.  I think it has to be.  Baba boo-y thing.  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo.  God, that was, uh.  How long ago was that?  It was like the late 80s, early 90s maybe even.  But after that, it just.  Was that cool after that?  Was it ever cool?  Well, I got to admit, it was kind of entertaining to hear way back when.  You'd be watching a news show or something and they're doing something and you hear that. 
[01:09:30]  But now it's like, eh.  What was great about that?  A little hat.  Actually, you know what was great about that?  All the dopey radio guys out there that couldn't handle it.  Ugh.  Yeah.  It was so easy.  You'd just go with it.  Instead of like, oh my God, hang up the phone!  Hang up.  Dump out.  Dump out.  They would get all freaked out.  Like, they couldn't go with it.  Now it's like, all right, say it.  With each time you say it, it gets more and more like, ugh.  I think, ugh.  Talked on and on about how you invented radio. 
[01:10:00]  Tell him, Fred.  Hoo-hoo-hoo.  Tell him, Fred.  Speaking of radio, Anthony, we were talking about podcasting and that guy asked you about  what you thought of podcasting and you did that old thing about TV and radio.  Yeah.  There's always a new technology that comes out and then, you know, people are against it  or whatever.  Yeah, they don't think it's ever going to fly and then it stays.  Well, one of our fine, faithful listeners, we get our best stuff from our listeners, sent 
[01:10:30]  in an anti-pay-TV PSA.  Anti-pay-TV PSA.  Now, pay-TV entailing, what, pay-per-view or just any kind of cable?  I'm not really sure if it's when HBO and all that started or the next level.  Who knows?  But basically, we were all, I guess, just enjoying our free TV.  God, that reminded me of one of those.  Remember the bad book guy we had on the other day?  Who had no sense of humor.  He's a comedian. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  600 and something.  602.  Reasons to be ticked off.  You know, listening to the replay, something that was pointed out that we didn't even jump  on, one of those that we read was, well, maybe it was because Big A was reading it and I didn't  understand a word he said.  It was when somebody messes with the aerial on the TV when the picture was fine.  Like, what?  What the fuck year was that?  Who's messing with the aerial on a television? 
[01:11:30]  The guy had, like, archaic things that piss you off.  Maybe that was the book it was from.  Older things that piss you off.  When there's not enough grease on my wagon wheel.  When you've carried fire for days and someone drops water on it.  I smell pit.  Archaic things that piss you off.  Horrible.  Okay.  When someone calls a radio show and yells, ba-ba-boo. 
[01:12:00]  Ba-ba-boo.  Ba-ba-boo.  That guy really had one funny line, too, when we were talking about when Andrew was  reading.  He goes, oh, this is good.  This is helpful.  Yeah.  It was like a really, it's like he should have just been a bitter prick and went with  it.  And this show would have been like, all right, this guy's pretty funny.  Right.  And plug the book.  Yeah, go with that whole thing about how this is just the worst plug for his book ever.  Instead of getting mad and hanging up.  Yeah, I got to go.  I'll call you back.  Yeah.  Will you?  Bye-bye.  Never got that call back, by the way. 
[01:12:30]  I was waiting.  Chris, the trucker, wants to explain.  Make that 603, fella.  Why that last caller said, ba-ba-boo.  Go ahead, Chris.  Bye, fella.  Yeah, that's, uh, if you hang out at the truck stop and you turn on the CB radio, that's  the, uh, faggot mating call.  They use that as the faggot mating call.  Say it twice when it bombs once.  That's good philosophy.  Maybe they didn't hear it.  Faggot mating call.  Yeah.  Ooh, faggot mating call.  Ooh, boy. 
[01:13:00]  Ooh, boy.  You are, what are you, some kind of minister of morons?  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Black.  Well, here's the anti-pay-TV PSA.  Let's listen to this, okay?  Because this goes right down the, this is in the same area as how people are talking about  satellite radio.  Like, why would anyone, why would anyone pay for radio? 
[01:13:30]  Who in their right mind would pay for radio?  Something that you could get for free.  Shut up.  We get it for free.  I'll bet you the first guy that went to buy pussy had to hear that argument.  Ah, this will never catch.  People will fuck for free.  Why would anyone spend cash on it?  And look at it.  All right, here we go.  You can take things that piss you off when the president freed all the, well, thanks,  Mike, Winter Park. 
[01:14:00]  All right.  In the zoo.  In your nightmares.  In the deep.  In your favorite horror movies.  But not in your living room.  On your TV.  Don't let pay-TV be the monster in your living room.  Pay-TV and cable TV companies are seeking the right to charge you for the very programs 
[01:14:30]  you now get free.  If you want to stop pay-TV and save free television, sign the petition in the lobby of this theater.  Let your lawmakers know how you feel in the fight against pay-TV and cable TV.  I guess that campaign didn't go over.  What year was that?  Where can I sign?  Obviously, that was being played in movie theaters.  Yeah.  Before the movie.  And, boy, could you see their interest in the whole thing? 
[01:15:00]  No, sure.  Stop it.  We don't want people staying at home watching movies.  What that was all about?  What year was that, would you think?  Mid-late 70s?  That's three, four years ago, at least.  That has that 70s feel to it.  You're right.  Anthony, I think it would be more than that.  Yeah, that sounded like some kind of a 70s.  That was a successful campaign, huh, guys?  Really worked.  I bet a bunch of people were signing. 
[01:15:30]  Oh, 1967.  Thank you, Eric.  You know what the best part of that thing was?  They were sitting in the theaters and watching that, and how many people were sitting there  going, there's pay-TV?  I could see movies on there?  Sign me up.  Just informed people.  Right.  Of course.  Of course.  I love these people that you meet, too.  And you're like, yeah, I used to love you guys at N.E.W.  I said, well, we're on XM.  Yeah, I don't pay for radio.  Really?  Yeah.  Then you just keep being a rebel jerk-off and listening to a half-hour of commercials  per hour. 
[01:16:00]  Go ahead.  Have fun.  That passive-aggressive thing.  Oh, you don't do that.  Go fuck yourself.  I don't do that.  You guys sold out.  I don't tip.  We didn't sell out.  This is the future radio.  Because we do an hour sometimes without a break.  Yeah.  You want to listen to wacky station IDs?  Oh, hold on.  And we get to say the word cock.  Ooh.  That's right.  We used to have to whisper to each other during break.  Now I can just look it open, blurt it out, and smile.  Preface with things like, will you suck mine? 
[01:16:30]  Oh, no.  Can I suck yours?  Show you mine.  Show me yours.  You know, two Ben and Tuffskins getting to know each other, exploring.  Who knows?  My body, your body.  Kind of similar.  By the way, I have to ask...  Yes.  Oh, it's Kev's Mike.  I don't want to add him.  Unfortunately, it is.  Ooh.  Oh, B.  It's not very nice.  He didn't add anything the last time I turned it on.  Well, he kind of got shy.  All right.  Maybe he gets shy.  Kev is shy.  I get scared.  Kev is shy.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  He's like that Burt Lark. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, you let the beard grow in, which I see.  I'm glad we smashed it.  Oh, the mump rat.  I wanted to know what guests you have lined up.  For this show?  No, for Run and Fest.  Wait a minute.  There was something.  What?  I forgot about that.  Didn't we give you like a week?  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks.  Two weeks to get the guests.  The guests, by the way, it's Big Kev.  So far, he got us Nathaniel and Hawk.  I have currently nobody lined up for the show, but I'm working on a few things. 
[01:17:30]  It just takes longer than the time allotted.  All right.  You can see I'm doing as good as the booker, though.  How long is it?  We have Saga calling it tomorrow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whatever happened to the chef from Hell's Kitchen?  Where's Andy Dick?  P. Bell?  Andy Dick canceled all press.  I was mad about that, too, but he had a weird thing happen. 
[01:18:00]  He canceled all press.  But he did Regis and Kelly that day, I heard.  Yep.  That's what I heard.  I heard he didn't even come in from the West Coast.  No?  That might have been a taped interview.  Maybe.  Maybe.  I don't know.  Let's, all right.  Well, we'll see how that plays out.  We got David from Alabama.  Hey, boys.  But I hear you're from O-Town.  Yeah, I am.  He's an O-Town guy that moved to Alabama, right?  Oh, it must be the toughest guy.  Auburn, Alabama.  13-0 last season. 
[01:18:30]  War Eagle.  Yeah, they really love their college football.  I just couldn't care less about college sports.  That's all we have here.  I know.  I wish I liked it.  It's a popular thing on Saturdays.  They get tired of waiting until Sunday.  Yeah, the town swells to like 100,000 on football weekends.  It's incredible.  It sounds like it.  Sir, were you...  They actually put out a game.  EA Sports put out a college basketball game.  Yeah.  Yeah.  College sports are huge. 
[01:19:00]  But why would you...  We're going to start talking about all that stuff.  That's what's going to make our show better.  But why wouldn't you just get the professional basketball game?  That's right.  Well, it's fun to, you know, see someone that has to go through school and sports as well.  So what do you got to do?  In a game, you play a little, and then you go and sit in a math class?  I'm going to make a...  We don't really care about it.  We just like to get drunk and watch them play football.  I'm going to make a statement.  I think college football is more popular than the NFL. 
[01:19:30]  Sure is.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I can't see that.  Get an expert to prove my point, please.  I have an expert.  Find me a jury.  Find me a jury.  David, you did the assault on the media in Alabama in what was a lion or tiger costume?  It is a lion costume.  It's meant for a small child that would go to about their knees.  And on me, it's like a really, really tight muscle shirt because it's sleeveless.  And...  What was it for?  How do you have that? 
[01:20:00]  I got it at Walmart.  It was in the kiddie section.  I thought, hmm.  Please, people, do assaults in children's Halloween costumes.  Please do that.  I really am a creep.  A couple things have been introduced to the assaults on the media.  Kid Halloween costumes.  Children's costumes.  And air horns.  Please come on those things.  I popped up 10 yards away from the news broadcast, so I had to put it on in my car and run down 
[01:20:30]  and hide behind the news truck.  Yeah.  And then my brother was recording it on TiVo, and he told me, go, go, go, and it went back  live.  See, you guys are figuring out how to do this.  You definitely need someone at home to help you out and tell you when to go.  And to tape it.  That's how we do it here in New York, because we do an assault on the media maybe once a  week at this point, maybe twice.  And it's a whole thing.  We got someone on a cell phone.  It's always Ben on the cell phone, though.  Yeah.  So they know when to run when they, uh, incoherent babble means run. 
[01:21:00]  I got to tell you, too, man.  You know what would really not be good?  And I don't want anybody, I don't want anybody to put on a mask and have some kind of an Opie  and Anthony's time while they're naked behind the reporter.  I certainly don't want to see that.  Oh.  I almost went pants, but then my junk would have been exposed.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It only comes to my midriff.  Talk about just calling the contest off and giving the guy the year's worth of prizes. 
[01:21:30]  A naked.  Oh, who's ever going to top that?  Absolutely.  I think we might have to give a really big prize to the best one of the year.  Yeah.  We have to do a year-end, of course.  Yeah.  What we do is we have the winner for each month, and then we'll have the listeners vote on their  favorite of the year.  It's not a bad idea.  Maybe for something really good.  Really, really good.  Maybe a real trip somewhere.  Two cushions.  Yeah.  Did you all notice that Dolores Keith is kind of a Pat Battle of the South?  No, she's a little lighter than our Pat Battle. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  When do you think maybe we should take Dolores Keith to the doctor?  We have ten shades of black, and I think she's about the fourth shade.  I think she's got about four shades there.  We haven't heard much from Pat Battle, even on the news.  I don't see her on TV anymore, so she's in hiding.  She's in hiatus.  She's barely on these days.  She's barely on.  They give her those little Jersey stories.  Yeah, she's just finishing out a contract.  She's, uh...  You think?  Yeah.  Where's she going?  Nowhere.  I think they'll probably just end up getting over.  The ravens. 
[01:22:30]  She's got...  So, David...  Well, it's Steven.  Oh, Steven.  I'm sorry.  David has actually my brother, so props to him for helping me with Tevo.  Okay.  Steven, so you had the lion costume on.  A lot of people said, dudes, it's a tiger costume because it was armored.  Um...  Yeah, thanks.  Um...  So, it was...  It was...  It was too tight for you, and walk us through it and tell us what happened after the fact.  Yeah, afterwards.  Yeah, well, uh...  Yeah, it's a little lion costume.  It has a little green bow right at my, uh, neck. 
[01:23:00]  Like all lions wear.  And I actually wore it in my high school homecoming parade because we were doing, uh, Wizard of Oz.  And I...  I have it even four years ago, so...  Yeah, my, uh...  My brother, I was waiting in my car.  He said, go, go, go, and it went live.  And I got caught on the door handle of my car.  Because I got really nervous.  So I said, fuck it, I'm not even going.  But then when they came back live, I...  I decided to go run up and wait behind the news van that was, uh, parked at the intersection.  So...  There were a bunch of cars, like, stopped at the stoplight while I was just waiting in the street. 
[01:23:30]  And my lion costume and my sign.  I was kind of showing them because they were all laughing and pointing and...  You know, making an ass of myself.  And he said, go, go, go.  So I run up.  I'm behind her and I'm yelling.  And I kind of go to the left a little bit because there was another news anchor, Bob.  This older gentleman.  And, uh, he started to come for me to grab me.  Oh.  You've got to get out of here.  And, uh, so...  Right as I went to video...  I mean, you couldn't hear the sound clip on the radio, but, uh...  I yelled, woo-hoo, as I jogged away gingerly. 
[01:24:00]  Because they could see me for, like, 30 yards just running away.  I was feeling eyesight.  That noise is never good.  No.  Woo-hoo!  Woo-hoo!  It was nervous.  Nervousness.  Yeah.  That's almost as bad as...  Wee!  Wee!  You are so in the lead, my friend.  You are the early leader for the month of August, my friend.  Yes.  I can't wait to hopefully win a MiFi because the SkyFi thing is getting a little old.  I like my SkyFi. 
[01:24:30]  I like it all right, but I want to be able to record you guys.  At this point, what I do with my SkyFi, when I'm jumping in my, uh, truck, yeah, I actually,  uh, go out to my car a half hour early and turn on Ethel.  Ethel's my station these days.  And let it just record a half hour of songs.  And then I get in the car and I see what it recorded and I'm like, oh, I like that song.  And as I'm listening to the songs I already recorded, it continues to record.  And then you go to the ones you really want to hear.  And then eventually, you know, you run out of songs that you recorded and then you're  finally live again and you kind of get depressed. 
[01:25:00]  Right.  You're kind of like, oh, man.  Live.  I got no options now.  Got no options.  You wonder why they broke into your car, baby, because you're running out, programming  things, leaving the door open, running back.  Hey, guys.  You know, because of this stupid sky-fi, someone will steal my car.  Because now I just take, you know, I take my alarm thing and I keep the car running.  So I do keep the door locked.  That's not good, though.  But someone's just going to, you know.  Break your window.  Break the window and go.  Drive off.  All right, Steven, congratulations. 
[01:25:30]  The early leader in the assault on the media contest for August coming from Alabama.  Thank you very much.  The video's getting a lot of hits on opianthony.com.  All right, you're going to make me a star, boys.  All right.  Thank you, Steven.  As we go to break, we'll play his audio one more time.  Here's Dolores Keith.  Dolores?  All right.  Thanks, Mark.  Of course, there are a lot of great reasons why people love Auburn.  Now, most parents with school-aged children love it because of its great public school system.  It's E-Rock Radio. 
[01:26:00]  I love E-Rock.  We love E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock?  What's that?  E-Rock Radio.  Yeah, I like them.  It's hot.  It's cool.  E-Rock.  E-Rock?  E-Rock Radio.  He's evil.  He's a bad guy.  He's not true to himself.  He's just ugly and his nose is falling off.  I don't love it.  He's a asshole.  Eric Dagle is this bisexual, incompetent radio guy, believe it or not.  I don't like listening to him.  He's not really that smart.  Eric can go fuck himself.  Go and save yourself. 
[01:26:30]  And take it on me.  Go and save yourself.  And take it on me.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Checking out some of the instant feedback on the program today.  We haven't even really told the new listeners.  A very interactive radio show you're listening to.  Lots and lots of ways to get involved.  Message boards out there, which are linked to opianthony.com. 
[01:27:00]  Instant feedback.  I don't even know how you do an instant feedback.  Is it through opianthony.com?  I believe you can get there.  All right.  Yeah.  There's also, if you have a Mac, there's widgets for it.  You could go to apple.com and download a widget that has,  it goes right up on your desktop.  What's a widget?  Well, it's this small program.  It rests kind of in the background on your desktop. 
[01:27:30]  You hit this little icon on your screen and all your widgets pop up.  And this widget is just a, it looks like, almost like a sticker.  It's got our faces on it and the place where you type in your name and your message.  And you don't have to log on to anything.  This proves opianthony are failing.  They now have to use widgets to make their show better.  A widget.  Cool.  Instant feedback.  Full stress from whackbag.com.  What happened to Jimmy's prostitute thing? 
[01:28:00]  The prostitute getting busted.  That's right.  We've got to get to that story today.  Where is that?  We'll get to that in a second.  Roger Harris.  Baltimore, Maryland.  Ron and Fez.  Great choice.  I'm a 60-year-old GTA player.  Jim, I'm a Vietnam vet, gun owner, member of the NRA, and the ACLU,  because Jimmy loves to label people.  I consider myself a flaming liberal who also wants to racially profile.  Kevin Green from North Carolina.  You guys are critiquing the assault on the media video like some asses talk about fine wine. 
[01:28:30]  Yes.  Mr. Met, whackbag.com.  He should have finished with a wacky lion roar.  That could have been funny.  Roar.  And Blind, I can't read it, from Bay Ridge.  Why not the XM Radio megaphone?  That could be fun, too.  Introduce the megaphone to the assaults on the media.  And incidentally, I do like to label people, because everybody is labelable.  No one likes to think that we're labelable. 
[01:29:00]  Like, hey, I don't really like to be labeled.  Really?  You're easy to.  I don't think the guy had a problem.  No, I don't mean him.  I'm just in general.  All right, good.  We all think that we're hard to label.  Dude, I don't fall into a category.  I'm so unique.  You're not unique.  Man.  No.  Dude, why does everybody have labels?  I don't know, because that's how we identify things.  We're not just random amoebas, you shithead.  All right, New York's number one hawker.  If you want a really good label, like, if you wanted to label car satisfaction, Saturn 
[01:29:30]  would fall into the label of fucking awful.  He's had so much trouble.  You're bad for him.  Yeah, he's never happy.  I'm happy.  I'm very happy.  He's never happy.  Ever.  Even on his birthday.  He comes in every day with a problem.  I'm tired.  Every single day.  Sleepy Jimmy.  He's sleepy.  You can only blame sleep for so long.  No, I'm not sleeping.  All right.  Me neither.  This weird thing, this escort thing is just blowing up, and Jimmy's really involved. 
[01:30:00]  And there's, like, hidden cameras and stuff.  That's the big thing that they're talking about with this case.  We're going to find out who else got their free hour.  Yeah.  Remember, we were trying to get listeners to take them.  Oh, yeah.  God knows what would happen.  Yeah, stupid lawyers in Washington messed up in one of our best bits.  This, uh, this, uh, what do you, what kind of a business is this, Jimmy?  Escort service.  All right. 
[01:30:30]  We'll call it an escort service.  NY Confidential.com.  Big fans of the show.  The leader of, uh, of this fine, um, company was a Uber fan.  Jason, yeah.  And, uh, he came in with his, with his ladies of the evening, one of these ladies, Natalia,  who was very, very cool and very, very hot, bringing in her young cohorts, all beautiful.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  Unbelievable, actually.  And they did some things, but in general, they were kind of boring in studio.  You've got to be honest.  And, uh, then Jason gave us all a free hour to enjoy the fruits of his company. 
[01:31:00]  Yeah.  And, uh, Jim Norton was the only one that took him up on his hour.  Of course.  That we know of, as people are giggling around here.  Because anyone from the show could have went down for a free hour.  Yeah.  And usually it's like $2,000 an hour.  Right?  That's what it says right here.  $2,000, yeah.  Two G's an hour to be with one of these girls.  And through this whole thing, uh, I could not believe that they were just openly talking  about this. 
[01:31:30]  I was like, it's just a matter of time.  This guy's going to get busted.  What is he doing?  Because this whole escort thing has always been kind of the underground.  It's there.  The police know about it.  The politicians.  But they kind of let it go on.  Just shut up about it.  As long as you're not just openly kind of saying, look what we're doing.  Don't brag.  Well, Jason was one of these, look what we're doing type of guys.  And he finally got busted.  Am I wrong?  No, absolutely wrong.  Okay.  So, uh, he got busted.  He's in Rikers, I guess.  The story exploded.  And Natalia went and did a bunch of TV. 
[01:32:00]  And she was on the, um, the cover of New York Magazine talking about it, right?  A really long article that they didn't interview you for.  They, well, the, the, Jason wanted me in the article.  He told this dumb reporter to contact me.  So the reporter contacted me.  I get back to him and he never got back to me.  We missed each other like twice.  By the way, if anybody has that article on Natalia, could you send that to New York Magazine?  And I think it's off the stands and I didn't buy it.  I'd love to have that.  I never banged a chick on the cover of a magazine before.  You don't have, uh, that magazine?  No, I don't know where it is.  It's that issue.  But I banged her and she was on the cover of a magazine. 
[01:32:30]  You know how great that is?  And it was a hot bend over show her ass shot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You know, someone please send that if you have it.  And I think you banged her while we were on the premium channel.  So you want to walk us through this a little bit more?  Because we have a lot of new listeners since you did this.  Well, Jason was a fan.  So he sent in these girls.  It was Natalia and another one.  And they were nice enough.  I mean, they hung out in the studio and I was very attracted to Natalia because she  had a, you know, kind of a nice badge, which I like.  You like the puffy ones?  Meeting.  Anything that just looks like you'd be embarrassed to get undressed with it. 
[01:33:00]  Short, brown hair, very petite.  Very sexy girl.  Very sexy, yes.  And Jason, like you said, offers us all an hour and I fully intend to take mine.  And I do.  And I take it with Natalia.  And it's a girlfriend experience.  A lot of kissing.  BBBJ.  Oh, yeah, kissing.  BBBJ.  Bareback blowjob.  Right.  No rubber.  Condom for sex, I believe.  I believe I do wear a rubber for sex.  I wouldn't have if she didn't, you know, make me.  Of course. 
[01:33:30]  And it was free.  Totally free.  Not a dime.  I hope they did film me.  My fat, awful, white fish belly playing with my nipples while she blows me.  God, watch it.  And this was done in Manhattan in a really nice place, right?  Gorgeous place.  And I hung with him for a while.  We talked.  Like, talk about the place a little bit.  They offered you alcohol, but you don't drink.  It's like a nice little bar area.  A lounge area with a bar.  It's like a really cool hang.  A couple of nice hot chicks walking around.  A security guy.  I'm sitting there with Jason. 
[01:34:00]  We're talking.  He's trying to show me this documentary that he's doing, like a reality show on VH1.  He wanted to pitch about the place.  I'm like, dude, this is an escort service.  What is he doing?  How are you going to have a reality show about this?  And I was watching it.  And then Natalia's changing in her room.  So I go in there.  She's with another girl.  Jason's like, dude, I want you to come once a week.  He used to call me.  It took me like a month to get down there.  Dude, come once a week.  I'll hook you up.  Threesomes, whatever you want.  And he offered me like two chicks that day. 
[01:34:30]  I didn't get greedy, though.  I only took the one.  Because I honestly got it.  It doesn't surprise me that they filmed.  Part of me was like, eh, you never know.  They may film.  You just didn't know.  It's like for security reasons, they might do it.  You know, this would have been considered plug-ola.  Probably, yeah.  Well, what I did to her certainly was.  That's what he was looking for, I guess.  And I would have given him to him.  Take care of you.  I mean, he's a fan of yours and all.  But then he knew you'd go on the radio and talk about it.  Let's skip this out right now.  If you're an escort service or whatever and you give me free pussy, you're getting plugged. 
[01:35:00]  That's the way it works on this show.  I plug you.  Screw the plug-ola laws.  I plug-ola nothing.  I'm just talking about my life and I'm making it funny.  Right.  Even if no one laughs, I'll yell LOL and I'll go back and fuck some more.  I can't believe I didn't take him up on those threesomes, though.  So you take her in the back room.  Yes, it's nice.  A beautiful bedroom, right?  Beautiful bedroom.  She's wearing a little...  Music playing.  The only thing I didn't like about it, it was daylight.  There was too much light coming through the window.  I kind of like it dark and dim. 
[01:35:30]  You know, the whole shame angle is kind of nice.  Don't we all.  Just two people lurking around in the darkness, clumsily groping, pretending it's anybody else.  Until something slips in.  Yeah, exactly.  Who really likes a spotlight on them when they're having sex?  Dude, it was bright.  But now I know they probably do that so they can get good footage.  That's why they invented candles.  So we could see each other when we were having sex.  Well, so I fucked her, and it was really nice, and I got sick right after.  I did eat her ass.  Yes, you ate her ass and got some wicked cold after it. 
[01:36:00]  I just got it.  Everyone was sick at that point.  We called it the ass flu.  Yeah.  Jimmy got the ass flu.  I forgot about that.  Remember?  The ass flu.  Symptoms?  Butterscotch around the nose and mouth.  She was terrific.  She was really good and bad.  Well, and what kind of positions did you do?  I think everything.  We, 69, I enjoyed that.  I got on the bottom, 69, with her.  Made out.  Oral sex, obviously.  You know, a little ate her ass. 
[01:36:30]  And then I think just regular missionary sex.  That's the way I like it, while she played with my nipples.  And I think I kind of just blew into a bag.  She claims she made $1.5 million a year servicing high roller clients.  Why would you claim that if you're not paying it in taxes?  I know.  They'll nail her on that, too.  Yeah, you can't say you made that kind of money and you're not paying taxes on it.  You've got to pay taxes.  Made no secret of her work at New York Confidential.  A swanky Moroccan-themed brothel.  She became infamous overnight and struck a provocative pose for the cover of New York. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, they labeled her New York's number one escort.  Yeah.  Well, Jason was calling her that.  It used to be the ad in the magazine that said that advertiser, New York's number one escort.  $2,000 an hour.  NY Confidential raked in $500,000 a month during the year and a half he was in business.  I actually talked to her after Jason got busted.  Before she got arrested, I called her just to see how he was and how she was doing. 
[01:37:30]  She's like, yeah, everybody's okay.  I haven't really talked to him.  Did you really call her to see how she was doing?  I did, actually, because she's not going to come and bang me for free.  I mean, the guy's in jail.  So I was like, yeah, it's called to say hello.  I didn't expect anything to come out of it.  Yeah.  Clients that included hedge fund titans, politicians, lawyers, and even an NFL quarterback.  Uh-oh.  This story definitely has legs.  I'm sure Ben knows who it is. 
[01:38:00]  I'm sure he does.  And, yeah, now they're talking about those cameras that might have been in there.  And some people, you know, for Jimmy to be on camera, he'd wave, smile, hope it shows up on the news.  Yeah.  But politicians, oof, that's a tough one.  I always wondered if they would do something like that just in case they got busted.  They could go to some of these guys and go, look, help us out.  I'm not going to help you out.  Well, you might want to because we have film.  Yeah.  Well, or if, you know, he wakes up after passing out, the hooker's dead, 
[01:38:30]  you've got to call some associates, some friends to come in and get rid of the problem.  I just, I fell asleep.  I don't know what happened.  I fell asleep.  But she got busted because she went on Donnie Deutsch and was bragging.  She was on Paula Zahn, bragging.  She did interviews pretty much all over the world.  People don't like braggarts, Opie.  They don't like the braggarts.  So they busted her in her apartment, and now she's hanging low until they defend her. 
[01:39:00]  It's a little odd based on TV interview things.  They must have more, though.  Maybe they have film.  Maybe they saw the footage.  Maybe.  Maybe they have audio of this program.  That's true.  There was some incriminating things being said there, I think.  Oh, I'd love to go on and testify on that one.  Oh, how much fun.  Do we have, I mean, because this is a hot story again.  We do have her calling the program.  Talking about the sex with me.  Talking about the sex with Jimmy.  But he didn't pay.  Huh?  He didn't pay her.  I still banged a girl on a magazine cover.  I banged a girl on the paper, Ant. 
[01:39:30]  You know, that never happens to me.  No, it's true.  I mean, we got audio of this girl.  I think it would be very interesting today if we could find it.  Did you eat the ass of this escort?  I did indeed eat it.  They usually end up in the paper after you've had sex with them.  Yeah.  Just oof.  Yeah, Jamie.  A shield with blood in it is found somewhere.  55-gallon drum.  Jamie has a comment here.  Let's go to Jamie.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  You know, we love you, but fuck.  No condom?  What the fuck?  No, no, no, no, dude.  I was worth five fucking million, Jimmy. 
[01:40:00]  Sure hole was like a fucking dipping pot hole.  What the fuck?  Dude, I did use a condom.  I'm so glad someone picked up on this.  Oh, you said it was a bareback blowjob.  Blowjob, yes.  Well, Jimmy, they pass AIDS through that.  Oh, you don't get the AIDS through the blowjob, my friend.  Yeah, that's your public service.  That's it.  Get all the blowjobs you want, people.  No AIDS dangers there.  None.  You little nidget, fuck.  What are you, nuts?  Dude, let me tell you something about AIDS.  Jamie, he ate her ass. 
[01:40:30]  Do you understand something?  I don't even know what he's saying.  Hey, dude, you want to hear a secret?  Oh, my liver.  Jesus Christ.  I banged a girl in a Brazilian whorehouse without a bag twice.  How do you live with your...  Brazil, though.  How do you live with...  It's all safe there.  How do you live with the fear that you might have caught something?  Can't happen to me.  I would be just out of my mind.  It just can't happen to me.  And, you know, I thought that I'm a major drama for, but holy shit, you know, I like to 
[01:41:00]  wash my hands after just touching the steering wheel.  Jamie, what the fuck?  He ate her ass.  It can't happen to me.  It cannot happen to me.  And I ate her ass, and I ate it well, and I'd eat it again.  I got an insane judge that likes to beat this shit out of women.  He wants to eat her ass again.  What do you give me for that?  Yeah, she wants you to eat it again.  Jamie, you're the best.  Get the fuck.  I'll show you free advertising from your ass.  Dude, I just got tested for everything. 
[01:41:30]  That doesn't matter.  It doesn't show up for 10 years, Jimmy.  Well, I'm 37 now, so what?  Am I going to live until I'm 46?  All right, fine.  You got that good old Arthur Ashe syndrome going on there, you fuck.  Anyway.  And it shows up sometime sooner.  It doesn't always take 10 years to show up.  Right.  I'm an election listener, and I love this fucking program.  All right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  You know, if I was 75 years old, I would just start effing everything.  Oh, yeah.  We're not even a worry in the world.  You know, you should exclusively have sex with girls with AIDS. 
[01:42:00]  It's going to take so long for you to get it.  They'll be happy about it.  They're having sex, not having to worry, no guilt.  There's probably some really hot ones out there with the hiv that aren't getting banged.  Right.  You mean you don't want to put anything on?  Nope.  Let her rip.  I'm 78.  Right.  What do you guys think of the term eating, by the way?  I've always hated that.  Oral sex?  Eating ass. 
[01:42:30]  Eating puss.  I mean, just the terminology.  What are we actually eating?  You eat her out?  What are we actually eating?  You're out, dude.  What are we actually eating?  I could definitely answer that.  We're not really eating.  We're just kind of...  Well, speak for yourself, huh?  Jimmy.  I don't know if we're actually eating.  Consumption is an option.  You eat ice cream in a cone, and you're just licking that.  Yeah.  That's an excellent point.  You really don't want to be eating anything.  I don't mean...  You really don't want some viscous mess. 
[01:43:00]  I really had to chew this time.  You know...  She sneezed, and something that felt like sauerkraut with glue in it shot into my mouth.  Let's say hi to Matt the Trucker.  Matt?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Little Jimmy, you are my fucking hero for tossing her salad.  Oh, sir.  I was a good boy.  I went right in there.  I just want to know, did you leave it in? 
[01:43:30]  Did I leave it in when, sir?  After the ass-tossing and the oral when you got to the missionary, did you leave it in,  or did you pull it out and just, you know...  No, no, dude, I had a condom on for sex.  I just did it for oral sex.  I had a condom on for sex.  Did you leave it in, though, and come in the bag?  Oh, I believe I did.  Yeah, I don't remember.  I believe I did.  Pull it out.  Holy shit, Jimmy.  Do we have that audio?  We have to have it.  You are the man.  We're looking for the audio.  Okay, yeah.  We're kind of stalling here.  Because you could rip out, rip that condom off, and then, you know, let her rip. 
[01:44:00]  I would love to have put her legs behind her head and just planted seed in her.  Yeah.  I would love to have just really...  I'd like to knock her up.  Really?  Yeah.  Why?  I just would.  To watch her throw herself down the stairs?  No, I would tell her that, too.  I'd tell her I'm going to knock you up.  Or all over.  That's sexy for you?  I'm going to fatten you up.  Make those beautiful little tits swell.  They're going to swell.  All right. 
[01:44:30]  Thank you, Matt.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  So, yeah, the big thing is, if there are these videotapes, who's on them?  Who's on them?  Politicians, bigwigs on Wall Street.  Eh.  Speaking of effed up shit.  Hawking, I'm sorry.  You never took your hour, did you, Hawk?  I tried to get you one.  Why?  No one else around here took their hour.  It's wrong with you.  I get to know you guys have girlfriends, but why...  Hawk.  Well, you know what?  And I was going to be a nice guy.  I was going to give my hour to a faithful listener. 
[01:45:00]  They're stupid lawyers.  They'd wreck everything.  They do.  What was wrong with giving away a free hour of companionship?  It's not illegal.  It wasn't illegal at all.  Of course not.  It was free.  You said, come down and bang a chick.  What, are you going to be a silly goose and say no?  And I wanted to give it to, like, a 15- or 16-year-old kid, because that would just  be a dream come true.  But I was at least smart enough to realize, all right, that could cause problems.  Yeah, that could be an issue.  Oh, it could.  Dude, what 16-year-old wouldn't want to lose their virginity to some kind of hot professional? 
[01:45:30]  I think that would displace the St. Pat's thing.  Instead of awkward sex with some chick with braces.  That's cool.  Anyway.  Speaking of, yeah, weird crap, I went and saw Wedding Crashers, finally, last night.  You're Mr. Movie, Jimmy.  I'm trying.  Jimmy Opie.  Jimmy Opie, whatever.  Whatever.  The Gregster.  What am I looking at?  Glenn.  Can we get the Gregster phone call, by the way, as we go to break?  Just remind me of something. 
[01:46:00]  I saw Wedding Crashers.  It's a good movie.  Yeah.  Everyone's ranting and raving about this movie.  Like, it's one of those movies you're going to go and see a couple times because it's just  unbelievably funny.  Yeah.  Definitely good.  The character development was really good.  Vince Vaughn is...  Vince Vaughn should never do a serious role ever again.  He's hilarious.  Owen Wilson is smooth as shit and funny.  Oh, Jimmy.  Sorry, Jimmy.  He's really funny.  Christopher Walken in the movie.  No one even talks that Christopher Walken is in this movie.  Oh, that's right.  And I think at this point, he's just talking like he thinks he's supposed to talk because 
[01:46:30]  he's heard everyone do his impression.  Yeah.  Doing an impression of himself.  You notice that, too?  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah.  He's doing an impression of himself.  He's heard, probably, the Jay Moore impression and a few other guys doing the Christopher Walken,  and now it sounds like he's doing an impression of himself.  But the movie was really good.  You know, I enjoyed it, definitely.  But they had previews.  What's coming up?  Well, the Deuce Bigelow European thing.  Ah! 
[01:47:00]  Because it worked so well for the Vacation series.  Fucking Hollywood should be attacked with Molotov cocktails.  Did you guys like the original Deuce Bigelow?  Who saw it?  No.  I saw it.  I would never see that.  And Rob Schneider, it looks like it's, I don't know.  Deuce Bigelow.  He did Bigelow.  It looks awful, but they did show a scene that made me laugh pretty hard, you know, because  you know how he's the gigolo.  Right.  And he's betting all these women, and he shows up at the door, and it's a monster of a woman. 
[01:47:30]  She's got to be like 6'5".  Oh, you saw the video?  6'5", 6'6", and she just pulls him and drags him into the house, right?  Yeah.  Makes him put on a baby outfit.  And they went old school with the baby outfit, you know, with the thing on the head and stuff.  The bonnet?  The baby bonnet?  He's in a baby diaper.  And all of a sudden, she's just well endowed with just huge jugs, and she has a bra on,  and she's, I, did he, did she have him tied up? 
[01:48:00]  Like, he couldn't really move or something.  He was in a position where he was definitely in deep trouble, and then she basically says  something like, are you ready for your feeding?  So that made me laugh in the preview, because it was just so deeply, deeply disturbing.  I didn't like the Deuce Bigelow character or anything.  Rob Schneider, though, I've really tried to hate everything he does, because it's just 
[01:48:30]  something bugs the shit out of me about him.  But there were a couple of movies I was watching, didn't want to laugh, wound up laughing.  Which one?  That goddamn, uh, The Hot Chick, was that it?  The Hot Chick.  Oh, a lot of people liked The Hot Chick.  It was funny.  It was stupid funny.  And I didn't want to laugh at it.  And that other really ridiculous one, where he was, uh, The Animal.  The Animal.  It was called The Animal.  Yeah.  I didn't see that one.  That one, I wound up laughing at that, too. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah.  It annoys me when I laugh at his movies.  But not the, uh, Deuce Bigelow, never laughed at that.  I never saw a movie he did.  No?  Never saw Rob Schneider.  Yeah.  A lot of slapstick stuff.  Goofy.  Let's go to South Dakota.  George?  Hey, morning, boys.  Morning, George.  Hey, uh, Jimmy.  I got a friend of mine that, a couple times a year, he goes down to Brazil, and, uh, for  like a week, he picks up hookers.  Mm-hmm.  And he got to him from one of them.  Did he really?  Ouch. 
[01:49:30]  That's silly.  Yeah.  He's probably banging trash or something, dude.  Well, you know, he, he, he used to say the same thing, man.  Oh, it'll never happen to me.  It'll never happen to me.  And he tested positive, uh, here, oh, about six months ago for us.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  That's kind of what I said.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  He was wrong.  Jimmy's right.  Absolutely.  Yeah, but hey, uh, you know, there's a massage parlor in Colorado when I'm down there that  I go to from time to time.  All right.  And a friend of mine does plumbing work down there, and they, they got called for a water 
[01:50:00]  leak at this place, and he warned me that a lot of these places have cameras set up  in them, and they are in each room.  All right.  I've always kind of sensed that, so that's why I'll normally have someone come to me.  But I've always kind of sensed that they have cameras.  And, again, if one of the girls winds up with a black eye or dead or says someone didn't pay,  if there's a real problem, they've got protection.  Yeah, I've talked to a couple of different cops down there, too,  that have told me the same thing, that they know that some of them have them. 
[01:50:30]  I wonder if they tape over the Johns after a while.  They probably just have a loop tape.  It's probably more for some type of security than it is just to catch you with some dumb business man.  I bet they keep them for a long time, Jim.  Maybe.  Look at Jimmy wondering and hoping.  Oh, they erase those like after an hour, right?  Right?  Anyone?  Can anyone help me so I can sleep at night?  You know, I didn't mean to.  I'm sorry, buddy.  Pugsley and PA, what's up?  Hey, you know, when I was 16, my brother took me over to each side of Manhattan to one of the whorehouses over there, 
[01:51:00]  and I lost my virginity.  I think it was great.  I mean, she was beautiful.  And, you know, being a kid, you know, I was kind of quick.  She gave me a second for nothing.  Ah, let you have two cups.  What's up?  She let you have two cups.  Oh, yeah.  Two cups?  I believe so.  Jesus.  Yeah.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Take care.  Yep.  And that's about it for now.  Okay.  We're going to take a break.  I guess we should point out something that's going on in the studio right now. 
[01:51:30]  We're signing lots and lots of wow stickers during the show.  We're passing them around.  My brother decided to tell everyone that ordered a Pest T-shirt, that they get an autographed Wow sticker from us.  Great.  And now I'm getting a lot of email from people going, where's my Pest T-shirt?  Well, the reason is that we haven't signed the Wow stickers yet, so we're signing them during the show.  Yeah, why not?  The Opie and Anthony Pest T-shirts are printed and ready to go. 
[01:52:00]  As soon as we get these signed, we'll start sending them out within a day or two, I guess.  And you can get Opie and Anthony T-shirts by going to opieandanthony.com.  My brother does some good stuff, including the Spread the Virus T-shirt.  We like that one as well.  Yeah.  All right.  I drive hookers.  Let's say hi to Jack in Boston.  What's up, Jack?  Yeah, no, I'm a driver for dancers, so to speak.  On the weekends, I used to be a doorman at one of these established places.  They definitely do have cameras. 
[01:52:30]  It's just so you can basically tell if some guy is doing something completely bad to some other girl.  So the place I was doing it at, they didn't videotape.  It was just more a security feature.  All right.  Hey, you drive those dancers?  Yeah, like weekend to weekend, you know, so guys don't stick their fingers in assholes.  Those are all for the strip club show.  Those are the worst when the dancers come over.  I've developed a real dislike for strippers.  They just don't do anything for me anymore.  Yeah, strippers are kind of useless.  They're awful.  You have strippers come over to your place? 
[01:53:00]  No.  For what?  To listen to them talk?  What's a stripper doing?  They're horrible.  No, I drive them to like bachelor parties or like, you know, frat houses or shit like that.  They do that awful, like, that awful, like, they put the ass up and they smack their own ass.  Looking over their shoulder at you?  Oh.  Smack the ass.  Being stupid, it's never sexy.  Stop.  Smack your ass.  What is that?  Ooh, she's racy.  Fuck off.  Yeah.  All right, guys, I'll punch it out.  Bye, mister.  All right.  I hate that shit. 
[01:53:30]  The stripper moves make me physically ill.  The lap dance.  The area dance where you can't even get near there.  Yeah.  They can't get near your lap.  Oh, no, no touching.  No this.  I'm just going to stand here.  Oh, like, I was watching you before I had to pay you 25 bucks, 30 bucks, whatever it is.  Oh, so I'll just sit and watch now alone.  Great.  That's fun.  It's awful.  What happened to the hair job?  Remember the hair job?  You'd be sitting in the seat and the girl would come up and flip her hair over her head and 
[01:54:00]  kind of move her head and her hair would shake on your lap.  That's great.  Wow.  Cornball bitches make me sick.  You always hear about a hair job.  Just work yourself up so when she does that you just shoot a load all in her hair.  I got a lap dance.  I got 11 from the same girl in Vegas.  She's the fucking greatest.  What she did was I like a pair of ass cheeks on my mule. 
[01:54:30]  I like it just to rock back and forth slowly.  I can hold their hips.  It's like, you know what I mean?  Oh, you weirdo.  To what?  I mean, I'm saying, but that's...  Wow.  A lot of them don't do that.  I did say that, like, you know, strap yourselves in, kids.  Here comes an original idea.  I kind of invented that.  Hoo-hoo.  Tell them, friend.  But what I'm saying is a lot of them don't do that.  They give that corny knee in the crotch.  Fucking just do this.  Straddle me.  Put your ass on my hog and fucking rock back and forth and maybe tweak my nipple through 
[01:55:00]  my shirt.  That's all I want you to do.  Right now?  Yes.  Oh, all right.  I want you to hold that Mary Carey pocket thing which you're bouncing around.  I'm just smacking Mary Carey's snatch on the console.  It's an awful thing.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and we're going to go to break with the Gregster phone call.  The Gregster.  This thing was on the internet for a while.  We played it a while back.  Basically, this guy that was blown off by this chick. 
[01:55:30]  His name's Greg, and he left just a very uncomfortable message for her, and he was referring  to himself as the Gregster, as in no one blows off the Gregster.  He's right.  Gregster.  Help.  Save messages, Thursday, 9, 31 p.m.  Laura, it's Greg, you know, the guy that you were going to get back with to let me know  if you were going to see me.  I'd still like to know, you know, tomorrow's Friday, but you know what? 
[01:56:00]  It's okay if you're not up to it.  You know, you've got other plans, obviously.  Okay, I'll be in touch, you know.  We'll give it one more shot, and we'll see what happens.  You know, it'll be a shame if you don't give me a chance, so that's for sure.  And like I say, I'm not, you know, I'm not looking for a romance, you know, but we can have fun. 
[01:56:30]  It's up to you.  But then again, this is not good.  You told me you'd call me, and you didn't.  So evidently, I guess this is supposed to be some kind of fun.  You could just be blatant if you want to be blatant.  But I'll see you.  And you know what?  Like I say, if you don't go out with me, it's your loss anyways, Laura.  I like you.  You're cool.  But you ain't all that, okay? 
[01:57:00]  I mean, you could return my call.  That doesn't put you high in my ranks of being civil, you know.  I mean, if the shoe was on the other foot, I'd at least have the respect to do that, you know.  But I guess that's the difference between us.  I'll fuck.  Go later.  Bye.  I broke my name, man. 
[01:57:30]  Oh, my hand, yeah. 
[01:58:00]  Ah, you mother.  Opie and Anthony, XM202.  Is this song on your iPod, Jimmy? 
[01:58:30]  No, I have some good ones out there.  A little Iggy Pop.  Royal Caribbean, that's a good song.  Man, they kind of wrecked it.  Sold out, man.  Man.  Come on, man.  Be true, you music man. 
[01:59:00]  A little visual, a quick one.  In the New York Post today.  If you don't think time is a bitch, we like to point this out from time to time.  Time stinks.  Time just stinks.  No one beats time.  Doesn't matter who you are and what you do.  Time blows and wins in the end.  Switch workbook.  We're going to the New York Post page 23.  CBGB's is closing, Anthony.  Care.  They're making a big deal about it here in New York because a lot of bands, of course, got their start. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah, CBGB's.  CBGB's.  Not that big a deal, though.  Doesn't matter what city you walk around in.  That cool, hip guy has to have his CBGB shirt on.  We get it.  We get it.  You're a rebel.  What a guy.  You're a rebel.  If it's 1977.  We should really start talking about the stupid t-shirts out there.  One of them is the CBGB shirts you see everywhere.  Yeah.  The other shirt you see everywhere is that dumb black dog. 
[02:00:00]  Which one?  Black dog?  Yeah, black dog.  It's a t-shirt company in what, Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard?  It's the black dog.  Someone help me here.  I'm the only one who's seen the black dog t-shirt.  I don't know that one.  Martha's Vineyard.  Thank you, fan.  You haven't seen the black dog t-shirts?  They're everywhere, too.  Well, I was only at the Vineyard a month ago, so I don't, uh...  No, it's not just a Vineyard thing.  I guarantee we can walk around New York within a half hour, we'll see a black dog t-shirt. 
[02:00:30]  Oh, t-shirt.  Yes.  The ones I hate the most are those fucking Che Guevara shirts or whatever his name was.  Enough already.  Yeah, you don't like that?  Ah, I fucking write already with them.  Everyone has one.  We know.  We know.  He was this.  He was a right.  I hate them.  I don't have Sabbath shirts.  And, of course, fat girls wearing the sexy, uh, shirts with cute little sayings.  Juicy.  Well, juicy comes to mind, but now there's just a million of them. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  Hot stuff.  Really?  Sex kitten.  Every fat girl should wear a shirt, and it should be white in the front and black on the back,  and it should have a blowhole in it.  That's what every fat girl should be forced to wear.  Just walk around in flip-flops, dress like a killer whale.  Or we throw fish at you, fat face.  That would prove you have a sense of humor.  But, anyway, getting back to why time is a bitch, CBGB's closing, and they're trying  to save it.  But, I guess, oh, it was the last night at the club? 
[02:01:30]  Punk rock rally.  Uh, well, anyway, they got a picture on page 23 of the New York Post of Deborah Harry,  a.k.a. Blondie.  Yeah.  Yee.  Yee.  Yee.  What happened to Lil' Blondie?  Remember how lil' she was?  And she, like, posed for Playboy and stuff, right?  Didn't she?  So they say.  Well, now she's wearing her girdle, like Anthony pointed out in the office, on the outside.  It's on the outside of a BB, what is that? 
[02:02:00]  A D.D. King?  D.D. King.  D.D. King shirt?  Yeah.  I think.  And a girdle on the outside of the T-shirt.  And black pants just showing a world of hurt poking out the sides.  She's all fat.  What happened?  What happened to Lil' Deborah Harry Blondie?  Maybe it was 1978 when she was Lil'.  Now, yeah, the club that helped launch the likes of Blondie, the Ramones, and Talking Heads. 
[02:02:30]  Gee, what?  30 years ago.  They owe $75,000 in back rent, and that's why they want to close the place.  They can't pay their bills anymore, because you know what?  In the end, no one cares.  Yeah, if people were going there, and it was great, and popular, they'd be able to pay their rent.  And all these big stars are going there, so they could get their mugs on TV and stuff. 
[02:03:00]  Yeah.  $75,000 for some of these guys is nothing.  Yeah, clock it up.  If they care that much about the club, why don't you just pay the back rent?  Mm-hmm.  Yep.  End of story.  Not gonna do it.  Someone should just turn it into a museum or something.  A place where you could get your CBGB t-shirts.  I don't know, that'll be it.  Anthony, you played at CBGB's, didn't you?  Everybody that has a band has played at CBGB's.  It's just another shithole to play in. 
[02:03:30]  This legendary thing.  It was awful.  The bathroom's got two inches of water on the floor.  Sewage leaking from the pipes.  Water.  Yeah, water.  Who knows what that...  Water.  Sludge.  Shit.  Piss.  And then, you know, it's the same thing.  You gotta go in there and you didn't bring any people and...  It's supposed to be a legendary rock club.  Right.  We're supposed to come in to entertain the people that are brought in because the club is huge. 
[02:04:00]  I always hated that one.  Where are your people?  Well, where are my people?  It's fucking Sunday night at 3 in the morning that we're going on.  Ah, my people are asleep.  You know who's awake?  My band.  You know who we should be entertaining?  People that your club brings in.  Since when do the entertainers have to bring people?  I fucking hate that.  We will entertain your crowd.  Bring them in.  It's your club.  Advertise the fucking thing. 
[02:04:30]  Have people come in.  That's it.  But no.  Bring your people.  Yeah, we played there and it was like, you know something?  This place is just another dive bar.  Good riddance.  Goodbye.  What do they want to put there?  I don't know.  Anyone know?  Well, it's down there in the Bowery, right?  And that's an up-and-coming area.  Yeah.  Apartment.  That used to be a place where it was the bums and the drug addicts and the hookers.  Actually, it was a good scene.  Yeah.  And now they're cleaning it up to the point where, once again, it'll be another neighborhood 
[02:05:00]  that's just very, very boring in New York City.  I like the clean city.  I love it.  They want to throw in buildings with doormen.  They want Whole Foods in the area.  They want apartments.  That's Ben Sparks, who knows a little bit about everything as far as New York goes.  But if people were going to CBGBs, they wouldn't even be thinking about that because they'd  be getting their rent paid.  Yeah.  $75,000 in back rent.  That's it.  So if these big-time celebrities care that much, then pay the bill.  Oh, that's two months in your place.  Why don't you help them out?  You know, when all these places were big, CBs, and Times Square was full of the sex shops 
[02:05:30]  and everything, the city was broke.  Remember how broke New York City was?  The city's got to be a money-making venture.  Sure, we all like the smut, but you can get all that, you know, Craigslist and on the  internet if you just want to look.  And the rest of the city's being filled up with places that make money.  They can pay huge taxes to the city. 
[02:06:00]  And the city's better off for it.  I don't mind walking around in the city anymore.  You don't feel like you're going to get killed.  When I was a kid, it was the most petrifying experience going on a field trip to, like,  the Museum of Natural History.  And the bus pulls up, and you get out, and it was just frightening.  There'd be bums all around.  You're little kids trying to get into the museum.  And bums everywhere.  If I may use the politically correct term, bum.  Bum.  All right, let's see.  Bum.  And people always say, well, when New York was New York, it was great. 
[02:06:30]  It was, you know, the porn shops because they hate Giuliani so much.  Yeah.  He cleaned it up.  It's better.  What do you think about Disney being there?  Who cares?  It doesn't bother me that Disney's there.  I don't know.  Disney sucks.  They're making cash for New York.  Yeah, it's really bad.  You fucking idiots.  And there's still plenty of places to get your sex.  Of course, dude.  I'm a pervert, and I'm happy that they did it.  Jimmy, yeah, exactly.  You're a degenerate pervert.  I'm filth.  And you're fine.  It's better now than it was.  Yeah. 
[02:07:00]  All right, moving on to other things.  Who hung up on you?  Well, we were talking about T-shirts, and a guy was going to make a comment that a T-shirt  he's sick of is black people wearing the Scarface T-shirt.  Yeah.  That is a very popular one.  That's a big one.  That's very, very popular these days.  So he had a great observation, but I guess he couldn't wait any longer.  Those Von Dutch shirts made me want to bury an axe in someone's forehead, too.  Yeah, like the trucker hats, but they're pink and lime green with Von Dutch on them, and 
[02:07:30]  they're like $100 a piece or something ridiculous.  And the shirt, and Bob Kelly has a couple of them, a stupid, you're not stylish.  Oh, no.  And on his big, awful body, it's Von Dutch.  One word per side.  Let's say hi to Jim in Tennessee.  Hey.  What's up, Jim?  Not too much.  What about the guys who were wearing the independent T-shirts?  I never saw that.  Independent.  Yeah, help us out. 
[02:08:00]  It's just one word on a T-shirt that says independent.  Really?  I didn't see that one.  Sorry.  I will say...  I'm sick of just shirts with sayings in general.  I saw one the other day.  I'm a talent coordinator.  Ugh.  That.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Cam's wearing an Echo Unlimited shirt, which I've never seen before, but I'm tired of Echo  Unlimited as a brand.  I'm tired of Sean John.  Yeah. 
[02:08:30]  All that shit.  Enough already.  Put on a Kiss T-shirt.  Be a man already.  All right.  Let's move on to some other things here.  But I want to talk about...  I found a good article in the New York Post Sunday.  Rock and roll.  They were talking about this new movie, Nine Songs.  Have you heard about this new movie, Nine Songs, Kevin?  No.  You're pretty good as far as this stuff goes.  Well, two actors actually have sex.  A lot of it.  In Michael Winterbottom's new film, Nine Songs, which opened Friday in New York and L.A.  It's probably one of these artsy movies, of course. 
[02:09:00]  This doesn't necessarily make for a great plot, but it has snagged major attention for  an otherwise tiny arthouse flick.  Okay.  It is a tiny arthouse flick.  Nine Songs is hardly the first non-porn film to cause a stir with explicit material.  From mainstream classics like The Postman Always Rings Twice to indie stinkers like The  Brown Bunny.  We've talked about The Brown Bunny on this show.  We have audio from The Brown Bunny, don't we?  Very hot blowjobs.  No audio.  Oh, no, audio is just an awesome video. 
[02:09:30]  And even a totally unsubstantiated rumor of real on-screen sex guarantees, a place of  infamy for any movie not relegated to the adult category.  So basically, this article is about movies and the rumors that there was real sex going  on in some of these scenes.  For example, Last Tango in Paris.  Yeah.  The plot of men and women having an anonymous affair in a Paris apartment.  We know that.  It's Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider. 
[02:10:00]  The rating originally was X, and then they re-released it in 82 and made it an R.  Claim to fame, the stars and director Bernardo Bertolucci were indicted and then acquitted in  Italy for making pornography.  Did they really do it in the film is the question I asked today, Anthony.  Brando, probably.  I don't think he can get a rod.  I think one day he said that his penis was the size of a peanut.  Really?  Yeah, there's a comment I read where I heard him say that it was wilted like a peanut. 
[02:10:30]  You think he got the fingers up the ass, though?  Wouldn't surprise me if Marlon enjoyed a couple.  Well, according to this article in the New York Post, did they really do it?  The answer, no.  No?  No.  There's a few other examples, but first, let's go to the phone.  John in Jersey, what's up?  Yo, what up, boy?  Hey.  Yeah, I just bought a T-shirt the other day.  It's the funniest thing.  It says, 124 out of 125 teenagers say Viva Aruba. 
[02:11:00]  Think about it for a second.  That's pretty funny, actually.  Yeah.  That's very funny.  That is funny.  Norton sucked his dick.  That is pretty funny, actually.  I like your shirt.  Why'd you have to make a hurtful comment?  Yeah, let's go to Chris.  Chris.  Yeah.  You can explain the independent shirts.  Go.  Yeah, I can.  It's a skateboard company, Independent Trucks.  Oh, but you should have known that.  And everybody just started wearing them to be posers, so.  You're at the skateboard shack.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  That's it. 
[02:11:30]  Let's say hi to Matt in Boston.  Go ahead, Matt.  Hey, guys.  I hate that Vote for Pedro shirt.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  It's like people see it on each other, and they can relate.  That was their losers, and they hate this loser freaking movie.  See, the first time I saw a Vote for Pedro shirt, it made me laugh, because I like Napoleon  Dynamite.  But you're right.  Now it's everywhere.  Hey, Jerry.  Happy birthday.  Thank you, buddy.  Ah!  Hey, Ovi.  Bill in Boston.  What's up?  Yeah.  Hey, how about those Hard Rock Cafe T-shirts? 
[02:12:00]  Awful.  Yeah, terrible.  Hey, stay out of room 237.  It's kind of cute, though, when it says Hard Rock Tokyo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You aren't there.  Shut up.  I'd like to know where they're from, though.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Hard Rock Vegas.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I was the worst with T-shirts years ago.  I'd get the T-shirts that would get, like, dated in two seconds.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  Like, I was the one with the Ren and Stimpy shirt.  Oh, really?  And then, you know, a little while later, you put it on, you're like, no one's even watching 
[02:12:30]  Ren and Stimpy anymore.  The little stupid, like, sayings.  Where's the beef?  Oh.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  You did not.  I think I might have had that one.  You did not.  Oh, just the worst.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  What an ass.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  That's awful.  Yeah.  I can't even look.  How hard is that?  I'm doing the rest of the show looking this way. 
[02:13:00]  I'm sure that won't be a photo shot.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  Send Rambo to Lebanon.  Rambo is hot.  Lebanon was hot.  Holy shit.  A month later, you're an idiot.  Conglomerated mango shirt.  Well, we started a little something here.  Let's go to Joe in Connecticut.  Go ahead, Joe.  Yeah, I'm sick of Iron Crosses on shirts.  I'm a biker myself, but I'm sick of it.  Everybody's...  Oh, West Coast Chopper and... 
[02:13:30]  Yeah, not just West Coast Chopper, but all biker, bike companies are, you know, using it now.  It's a little overplayed by...  Yeah, the Iron Cross.  Go with the swastika, I say.  That's what I'm talking about.  Let's pop that on a t-shirt.  You probably could correct.  Use the right thing.  You want to get attention.  Why are you putting things on your t-shirt?  To get attention.  So people look and go, oh, you get some kind of reaction.  Harley, though he's wearing Harley shirts, too.  Put the old twisted cross on there.  I have a really...  Hey, Tim, you coming to Connecticut?  Nah, sir, not for a while.  I have a really cool shirt, actually. 
[02:14:00]  It says, uh, co-ed naked volleyball.  Oh, is that a scream?  Oh, the co-ed naked shirts.  I forgot about those.  They're fucking terrible.  And they have one for every sport.  And every one of them is fucking terrible.  You know what would be cool if it had a picture of Jean Benet?  And it said, co-ed naked murdering.  Can you just say, repeat after me, say terrible two more times?  No.  Please. 
[02:14:30]  Terrible.  No, say terrible.  Terrible!  Say it the right way.  Terrible!  Say it the right way.  It's the terriblest!  Why can't you ever play along?  Terrible!  Because I know henchmen will do a little, uh, thing with the word terrible now.  Like you did with phenomenal.  All right.  I'll do it.  Terrible!  Terrible!  There you go.  Thank you.  All right.  How about this shirt?  Let's say hi to Chris in Philly.  Go ahead, Chris. 
[02:15:00]  Chris?  Hey.  I was in a mall the other day.  I saw one of those trendy goops wearing a sex ed honor student t-shirt.  Oh, that's great.  Uh, he's getting his sexual education.  The no fear t-shirt.  Those are another old one.  Yeah.  Dude, when I see those on like those fucking annoying trucks down the shore with that little,  like the guy that looks like the Hawaiian punch guy hair on that no fear, I want a drunken  truck driver just to smash into them. 
[02:15:30]  Or the other guy, the little cartoon guy pissing on the Ford emblem.  Calvin.  Yeah, Calvin pissing on Ford.  Yeah, I'm a Chevy guy.  No fear.  Should, after the drunk driving accent, it should be no movement below the neck.  All right, Jesus.  Don't encourage him, angry little fella.  Go ahead, angry little fella.  Oh, what's up, bu-bu-bu-bu-buy?  Hello.  Hello, buh.  Uh, you know what grinds my gears is when I see people wearing a Misfit shirt with the 
[02:16:00]  logo.  We have no concept of the band or who they are.  Absolutely right.  Whether they own an album or not.  Very good.  That's right.  I hate when girls wear shirts that say porn star.  Yeah.  Because you're cock-teases, you're not porn stars.  Yeah.  They got all these 14 years old, too.  Exactly.  Provocative t-shirts and they don't want you to comment on them.  Yeah, hot topic shirts.  Let's say hi to John in New York.  Good morning, buh-bu-bu-buys.  Hi.  I saw a t-shirt on Sunday. 
[02:16:30]  A guy was walking.  The t-shirt said, don't piss me off.  I'm running out of places to bury the bodies.  I would just laugh forever.  And by the way, my wife wears one of those juicy shirts that says hot bottoms.  Hot bottoms?  Yeah.  And how hot is her bottom, sir?  She's pretty good.  She's about 115, about 5'7".  All right.  There you go.  She's a hot bottom.  You know what shirt I really like?  I saw a pregnant woman with a shirt and right over the stomach it said, this is a fine place 
[02:17:00]  for a foot.  All right.  Roger, Mississippi.  Go ahead, Roger.  Who doesn't still laugh when you say, I'm with stupid, and the arrow, and you're next  to the guy.  Come on now.  That's hysterical.  But the best one, I've got this one.  I actually have one black one and one white one.  It's his FBI female body inspector.  Oh, see?  Now that's funny.  Let's go to Roger in Mississippi. 
[02:17:30]  Roger?  Roger?  Yeah.  Hey.  What's up, guys?  Roger.  Can you hear me?  Over.  All right.  You know that movie Monster Ball with Halle Berry?  Yeah.  Ah.  That whole sex scene is completely real.  That's what they say.  Yeah.  Halle Berry.  He's not that good of an actor.  It's not listed in this article, unfortunately.  I would love to know about that one.  Oh, dude.  The shirt I'm most sick of?  That fucking crinkle, crinkle shirt that you can get off eatabullets.com? 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Horrid.  All right.  Back to the article.  The Postman Always Rings Twice, 1981.  We all enjoyed that film, right?  That's right before he signed Anthony's Picture.  A drifter has an affair with the wife of a roadside cafe owner.  With good old Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange.  Jack Iccolson.  You know?  Oh, is that hard?  If he would have just put J.N. on there, it would have been more believable.  So you're not buying the autograph that he got yesterday from... 
[02:18:30]  Oops!  Jack Nicholson.  Oh, it slipped right out of my hands and fell on the floor.  When do you think maybe we should have this dog shit signature authenticated?  Where's the certificate of authenticity?  You don't be really funny if that really was a Nicholson autograph.  Oh, it is so not.  No.  Certificate of Authenticity.  It's a ditto.  It's a goddamn ditto.  And we actually took a picture of it.  Oh, what you would know?  Let me see.  And it's not... 
[02:19:00]  Show it to big Kevin.  And the certificate doesn't tell you what it's...  Authenticating.  Exactly.  You would think you'd say something about Jack Nicholson in the certificate.  It's an authentic photograph of Jack Nicholson.  It would be signed, like the certificate would be signed, maybe an official seal that is used in it.  Look at the certificate of authenticity.  It's a yellow...  A ditto.  Something...  Even the certificate of authenticity doesn't even look authentic.  No. 
[02:19:30]  I'll tell you if it's real, actually.  No.  All right, so the postman always rings twice.  Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange are rated.  The erotic thriller, one of the first of its era, featured a tabletop sex scene rumored to be more than just good acting.  Did they have sex in The Postman Always Rings Twice, Anthony?  Ah.  I say no.  The answer is no, yes.  Oh, look at that shirt.  Let's get Jewish.  That's good. 
[02:20:00]  What happened?  Nothing.  What did I do?  What did he write?  He just personalized my Jack Nicholson picture.  He just wrote Anthony on it.  You know what?  This freaking article I brought to the show stinks.  Well, look at a lot of...  It stinks.  The only one that had real sex is brown bunnies, it turns out.  That blowjob scene. 
[02:20:30]  Lloyd signed it, too.  The bartender.  You don't even see it, but Lloyd signed it.  A certificate of authenticity that has no way to contact the company.  No, there's nothing in there.  What a scam.  Scatman Crothers signed this?  Oh, my God.  Oh, wow.  Let me see.  How cool is that?  Oh, wow.  How do you spell Kubrick?  Doesn't matter. 
[02:21:00]  He didn't spell Nicholson right.  I can't believe Scatman signed that.  This offers an unconditional...  Scatman would not sign this.  I don't think that's his...  Why would he sign it?  N-I...  Bald first.  Yes.  Bald.  This has to go up on eBay now. 
[02:21:30]  How funny would it be if that really was Nichols' signature?  We just ruined it.  There it is.  No, it's not.  Grady.  And you've...  Been...  Cor-rected.  That's what he writes on him.  Oh.  That's a good one.  This picture is destroyed.  That's a good one.  I'll put it up on eBay.  Oh, what? 
[02:22:00]  With the certificate of authenticity.  All right.  There you go.  I'm missing bald...  No way.  Oh, let me see.  Jimmy's got the picture back.  There's another one.  I keep missing autographs.  I guess they're on there.  But Jimmy's just got to point them out to me.  Well, it's a dark picture.  I think darker by the second.  30-day money-back guarantee.  Yeah.  30-day money-back guarantee.  Well, that's nice.  Yeah, where? 
[02:22:30]  Let's see who else signed this.  You can tell it's a bad photocopy.  It's all crooked.  It's straight.  Tony signed it, and it...  He makes a little mouth.  A little child's mouth, and he's way in the back there.  Yeah, Tony.  He was silly.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wait, he wants to put it on eBay, though.  I'll put the bits on eBay.  I'll tape it back together.  There you go.  Take it together.  There you go.  You've got four sales. 
[02:23:00]  You can get Tony.  You can get bald...  Well, you know, Scatman.  Let's say hi to Anthony in Jersey.  Anthony.  What's going on, guys?  Hi.  How about...  I'm doing Jimmy's video.  I'm not as pink as you drunk, I am.  That's a great one.  That's a good one.  I'll talk to you guys.  Punching out.  What is that other one about sex, being bad for your vision, and all the letters are blurry  that say it, and you look and go, whoa, I can't see. 
[02:23:30]  Oh, I get it.  I have a cool one with just John Lennon wearing a New York City shirt.  That's great.  That's a tribute.  Todd in North Carolina.  Hey, what do you say there, guys?  Hi.  Hey, I was wondering if you guys have been to a t-shirt, hell, or rottencotton.com, and  seen, uh, I've got to cruise the airplane.  You've seen that one?  It says, uh, my Mexican works for less money than your Mexican.  Ah, great.  Horrible shit. 
[02:24:00]  All right, sir.  Punching out.  Thank you.  Please.  Let's go to Scott in Alabama.  Scott.  Yeah.  How y'all doing?  Good, Scott.  Hi.  I don't like them t-shirts.  I'm playing white t-shirts.  And niggers be wearing all the time.  Hey, stand up.  Wow.  Thank you, Scott.  Scott, you're welcome.  He actually said you're welcome.  Yeah.  Yeah, I know.  That is a trend in the, uh, community. 
[02:24:30]  White t-shirts, but.  I would have said it differently, of course, than Scott in Alabama.  They love the oversized white t-shirts.  That's the, uh, style this year.  All right, we're going to take a break, because, uh, Scott ruined it.  Can we play part two of the Gregster phone call?  I think that, uh, I think part two is better than the one we just played.  The Gregster.  The Gregster as we go to break.  Saved message Thursday, 9, 38 p.m.  Yes, it's Greg again, Laura. 
[02:25:00]  It'd be nice if you'd call, and at least let me know if we're on for tomorrow or not.  I'd appreciate it.  You know, that's just not right, man.  You know, at least you kick it with me.  We have a good conversation and everything.  And then you just, like, you know, like, are totally irresponsible.  I don't care what you're doing right now.  And you know what?  I'm sure.  And I'm going to blow my own horn again. 
[02:25:30]  But you know what?  I'm sure I'm better than what you're dating.  So, hey, you're lost again, okay?  You could have had at least the dignity and the respect and courtesy to call me tonight.  Oh, I'll get back with you in a few days.  Instead, you take a coward's way out if you don't want to see me.  Hey, believe me.  I'm not in a mall that often, but I can forget where you work there real easy.  You know, if that's what you want, that's not a problem.  I thought you were at least a civil chick, you know? 
[02:26:00]  I thought you were a decent person at least.  But I guess impressions, no matter how conclusive they are, they can be wrong, obviously.  I mean, like I say, you ain't all that, girl.  You're hot.  I'd like to get with you, like I told you.  Basically, that's my only motive anyways.  I'm not looking for anything of any validity or substance with you, okay? 
[02:26:30]  You know, I like the way you look, and I'd like to get with you, you know, sooner or later.  And maybe that scares you.  I don't know.  Hey, but you know what?  I don't care because I'm Greg.  I'm the Gregster, you know?  So you ain't hurting me.  It's just your loss.  That's the way I look at it.  And you'll see anyways.  In time, you'll realize that.  You won't be the first girl who's made that mistake. 
[02:27:00]  And around my way, believe me, there's a few of them who wish they would have reciprocated when the opportunity was there.  But you know what?  That's okay, Laura.  I just thought you were a little cooler than you appear to be.  You know, I thought you were a decent person.  Evidently, you can't even take two minutes to call me and let me know what's up.  What do you think? 
[02:27:30]  I got to beg for your attention or something?  Hey, maybe you got some puppy dogs that you're running around with little tails between your legs just because they think they got a shot.  But you ain't got nothing that I ain't had before and better, okay?  So I guess we won't even talk anymore.  Okay?  Bye.  In a starchy world, wired in imperfection.  What the hell is that?  It's a bagel, but for some reason at this place, they put it like on the grill. 
[02:28:00]  One man.  It's all about me, me, me.  The challenge.  The status quo.  They don't have a toaster?  That annoys me.  Navigating treacherous terrain.  There's crap all over it.  Like I'm seeing grease.  Confronting the unknown.  And there's something green on it, which could be a pepper or a booger.  It's awful.  The platoon of interns.  You sheep.  And military precision.  Go, go, go.  Fix it.  The world will witness a revolution. 
[02:28:30]  Bagel diva.  Coming soon.  Come on.  To a bakery near you.  Are you kidding?  Give me five.  Give me double ton of time.  We're taking the O.P. and Anthony program on the road, discussing that during the commercial break. 
[02:29:00]  We're headed to the X Games in L.A.  I guess enough time has passed that we forgot how much it sucks to go on the road.  That's how they bamboozle us.  I don't mind going out to California, though.  That's kind of cool.  Yeah, we'll be at the X Games in L.A. broadcasting live.  I think we're changing the show time and all that.  I don't know where we're broadcasting from.  Changing show time?  What?  When?  What?  Friday, probably afternoons.  Wait, what?  I think we're broadcasting from 2 to 6 p.m. on the West Coast. 
[02:29:30]  So on the East Coast, you'll hear us from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., I believe.  Wait, wait, wait.  It's got to be 11.  I always do that.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  But what do you?  I'm sorry.  I always do that.  So now we're broadcasting from Oregon.  I don't know.  So what time would it be?  We're just broadcasting.  Is it 3 to?  No, we're going to be 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
[02:30:00]  11 to 3 on the West.  Okay, yeah.  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the West Coast.  That would be 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on the East Coast this Friday.  The funny thing is about Jimmy's got to say his name every time he signs it.  What?  Jim.  What other show just sits around and signs autographs and gets the times wrong of when they're broadcasting from L.A.? 
[02:30:30]  Jay Moore will be stopping by Friday when we broadcast live from the X-Gamer.  Do we have any guests at all for Friday?  Yeah, we've got some dudes.  But, I mean, do we have anybody?  We're going to be in Los Angeles.  Yeah, we're going to be interviewing a lot of dudes.  From what, the games?  Yeah.  It's all about the X-Games this Friday.  The funny thing is we're doing one show from L.A. Friday.  Like I said, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. West Coast time.  We'll be live.  And we have to take Thursday off to fly there.  And then we're going to be too tired to do a show Monday. 
[02:31:00]  Are we off Monday?  Yeah, what a waste of time.  Yeah, because we can't get back soon enough.  So we're going out there for one lousy four-hour show.  And we miss a week and a half of shows.  We have to take two days off just to do that.  When do we fly home?  Sunday or Monday?  I love this gig.  Sunday?  Commercial radio would never allow this to happen.  We fly home Sunday.  Well, you know what it is?  We're going out Thursday because the time difference is going to mess us up.  So we'll leave here at 7 a.m.  We'll be in Los Angeles at 10 a.m.  So we need a total of 25 hours to prepare for a broadcast. 
[02:31:30]  Which is odd because here it takes about 11 minutes of newspaper reading,  me screaming at the computer, Anthony reading shit,  and Ope just kind of sitting there eating yogurt with a backpack in his lap.  A lot of big show prep.  Ben with that fucking abortion on the front of his desk.  Hey, Ben, who do we got?  I got emails out.  Do you really?  To who?  To who?  I didn't hear back. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah, I guess technically we could do a show from L.A. on Thursday.  We get in early enough.  We should throw him a show like in the afternoon or something.  We could do a show here Thursday.  Fly out Thursday afternoon.  Say we get a 3 o'clock flight.  We're there by 6 p.m.  Relax, have dinner.  Go do the thing.  We do Friday morning show.  We come home Saturday morning.  We're back on the air Sunday.  I'm very sleepy.  Me too.  Tired.  I need plenty of time to recoup.  And that long flight Sunday is going to kill us.  I can't possibly do a show 20 hours later on Monday. 
[02:32:30]  We have to fly the whole crew out there.  We have to take a day off just to get there for one lousy four-hour show.  And then we have to take Monday off because we're going to be tired.  And I can't wait.  Exactly.  Here's the best part about this flight is that stupid Martini Steve is probably hoping  for another bump up.  Oh, that ain't happening.  Not happening, stupid.  You're in coach, my friend.  But these are regular first class seats, not the super first class.  No.  It's still nice, but.  Probably about a 737.  737.  There's only a few planes that have the big ones.  757 on the way home. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, 200, which has the big ones.  A little better, yeah.  I almost switched my flight going out there to get the big first class seats.  It's so hard to find a good big plane these days.  I don't know.  Wide body.  Nice 767.  Anyway, if you're in the L.A. area, stop by the X Games on Friday and say hi.  Where?  I don't know.  Because I guess the X Games are all over L.A.  I don't even know what venue.  We're in a stadium.  We're in a stadium near an ocean, I think.  Is it Something Arena?  The Something Arena?  All right.  The Something Arena. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, we'll be at the Something Arena on Friday for the X Games.  I'm sure it's a corporation.  Home Depot Center.  Home Depot Center.  That's where we are.  What prima donnas do we just sound like?  Yeah, this is not the good first class with the wide body seats.  It's the crappy first class.  This is the first time in my career I've ever been flown first class by a company.  Ever.  It's great.  Ever.  These fucks don't forget anything.  JC from Wackbag.  Go ahead. 
[02:34:00]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  Hello, Jesus.  I want to know if O.B. already reserved his Geo Metro for the trip.  All right, boys, you suck.  You're renting a car out?  What do we got?  I'll probably rent a little.  A Geo Metro.  I might rent one of those motorized scooters this time around.  One of those golf carts.  That looked like they could handle a side impact collision.  Ant and this chick are getting into a Lamborghini.  O.B.'s like, ah, that's ours, hon.  It's a Ford Taurus.  That's a smart sedan.  Well, we both were waiting out in front of the hotel in Beverly Hills for our cars. 
[02:34:30]  We both came out at the same time.  We're waiting for our cars.  And I guess yours pulled up first.  Yeah.  And it was, um, what was it?  It was a brand new.  A brand spanking new Ford Taurus or something.  A Topaz.  It was brand new and it was.  It was one of those.  It was brand new.  It was shiny and, you know.  It was real boxy with huge windows on the side, you know, and four doors.  It actually came with a wife and kids in the back. 
[02:35:00]  Just a fat woman and nagging awful children.  I was just happy that I stepped up and actually bought a, rented a car for once.  Mine, uh, I heard it coming and said, that's mine.  You could hear the turbine.  Like, the thing just ripping up the ramp.  What?  It was a rocket ship that I had.  Hop in and, oh, he's sitting there rolling the windows down.  My roof is coming down.  This is a wonderful convertible. 
[02:35:30]  He got the hand roller.  Hard top convertible just stashes in the back.  The spoiler comes up in the rear.  Oh, it was amazing.  And then you just took off to Rodeo Drive.  Just burnt rubber out onto Rodeo.  And, uh, yeah.  Oh, what am I going to say?  All right.  Why don't we move on to some thanks?  Thanks!  Uh, Raphael Palmeiro.  Steroids.  Steroids.  A lot of controversy here, though.  No surprise.  Uh, he's saying no. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, he's saying no right now.  He's kind of saying it was an accident.  Yeah.  Because a lot of times I'll pay for sex.  My $300 just slips out of my wallet into her pocket.  Right!  I can just own up to it already, dude.  Busted.  He's not owning up to it.  Deny, deny, deny.  That's all you got to do.  No one fesses up to anything anymore.  If you want some Wasticka signed, you'll get him signed.  I got a new pile here.  The never-ending pile. 
[02:36:30]  You could thank my brother.  I'm just going to make a stamp.  What?  Now you know what it's like to be me.  I go over my, uh, my family's houses to just say hi.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden they're, they had me signing t-shirts and old pictures when I was a Cub Scout and bumper stickers and all sorts of huge memorabilia that ends up on eBay.  I'm like Ted Williams, man, to my family.  I don't know what it's like to be you.  Just sit down and sign.  Waiting to freeze that head. 
[02:37:00]  Just sit down and sign.  Famous boy.  I don't know what it's like to be you, by the way.  Um, maybe a couple more commas.  I'd like to know what that's like.  Maybe some better abs.  Hot chick.  You know, I'm 0 for 3.  Well, everyone can get the better abs.  That's easy.  Jimmy, you're going to have to calm down on your signature.  I'm trying to sign my sticker.  I'm taking the, he's signing the entire WOW sticker now.  Leaving no room.  I only did it on a few. 
[02:37:30]  Jimmy, these guys, you know, take their autographs from us very seriously.  Do they really?  Oh my God.  Can they show up at an event?  I'll just sign this one.  Sign it in black on the black.  That's where you get shitheads.  Exactly.  These guys want their autographs.  Do they?  Yes, they do.  I mean, I could sign their face with my clear stuff.  Let's say hi to Ryder in Virginia.  Ryder?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's going on?  What's up?  I got a shirt for you.  All right.  All right.  It says, now hiring, apply below. 
[02:38:00]  Now hiring, apply below.  Oh, apply.  It's got an arrow pointing down.  Gotcha.  Of course it does.  Very good.  It's the dick joke.  All right.  Let's say hi to Jeremy.  Jeremy?  Where's Jimmy's money, you faggot?  Oh.  I got confused.  I forgot to send it in.  I was compartmentalizing.  I'm trying to shame mother.  All right, sir.  What?  Jeremy, go. 
[02:38:30]  Hey, I wanted to say something to Jimmy Norton there.  That Shamu comment, man.  Ah, you build yourself as kind of the pervert.  Shamu?  You're in the, yeah, you guys were talking about t-shirts.  You were saying the fat chicks should have the white on the front, the black, the blowhole  on the back.  It wasn't Shamu.  Oh, orca.  Orca, yeah.  Or whale in general.  Right.  Oh, come on, dude.  That was just funny.  So what's the point?  Well, the point is that you kind of build yourself as the pervert's pervert.  You know, you're into trannies and all those other fun crap. 
[02:39:00]  I'm not at the trannies, sir.  You can't believe it better.  Huh?  Go ahead.  Say what you guys are.  There's a lot of us out there that are kind into the big women.  Now, I'm not talking, you know, Jabba, huge.  I'm not talking, you know, pick a roll and fuck it, but.  Chubby cheese.  Hey, when Jimmy said that comment about a shirt he wants to see, were you in your car with  your wife and now you feel like you have to call in and defend her?  No, no.  My wife, I'm a trucker, man.  My wife's back in Missouri.  She doesn't have an XM.  She doesn't hear this shit.  It's not like I'm like, oh, hey, honey. 
[02:39:30]  How much your wife weigh, my friend?  How much does she weigh?  What does she tip the scales at?  And by that, I mean the scales you have to pull your truck on on the highway.  What does your wife weigh, sir, honestly?  Honestly, maybe 215.  Okay, so basically, I mean, I was just making a little bit of a weight joke, but you got  kind of mad because, you know, there's a fat pig at home.  Oh, no.  See?  You've always been into the fatties? 
[02:40:00]  Oh, well, you know, I like big chicks.  So it tastes like a big ass.  It's just...  Sure.  How tall is she?  There's more there.  You know, like I said, you know, not...  Three foot two.  You know, you're looking at it going, which ones are the tits?  Because, oh, those are the ones with the nipples on it.  That's just nasty.  No, dude.  How tall is the slob?  Oh, God.  She's about 5'7".  Okay.  That's 5'5", and she's 230.  And how much does she weigh when you married the young lady?  She hasn't gained that much. 
[02:40:30]  She gained about maybe 30 pounds.  That's a lot, bro.  Maybe a little bit more, but she lost a bunch, though.  How big did she actually get?  How big she actually gets?  Yeah, like you said, she lost a bunch.  When you've lost a bunch and you're down to 215, you were at one point, you were almost killable.  She was just under 200 when I married her.  All right.  What did you like about her when you first saw her?  She got up to maybe 245, maybe 250 right in there. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  What did you like about her when you first met her?  She was smart, had a real pretty face.  To be brutally honest, she had a great set of tits.  Wait, sir, you said when she was brutally honest, every time she'd take a bite, did she go,  go away, bad childhood, go away, bad childhood?  No. 
[02:41:30]  I'm supposed to be the fist-off one here, and I'm laughing.  No, really, she did not get big until she married her first husband.  It was, you know, she couldn't get out of it.  It was an abusive relationship.  What would he do, put donuts on his fist and punch her in the mouth?  It was abusive.  But it was kind of a psychological thing, you know.  She felt that she made herself big that she'd be undesirable to him and he'd leave her. 
[02:42:00]  Oh, that's the strategy.  She gets fat, the husband goes, oh, I'm leaving.  Yeah.  She ended up leaving him anyway.  You know, it didn't work.  But the big deal is, you know, Jim's a freak as far as all the different fun things he's into.  There's somebody out there for him.  There's somebody that's going to say, my God, you're perfect, you know, because of all the fun things you're into. 
[02:42:30]  I looked at my wife and said, damn, I've got to have it.  Yeah.  Did you date a lot growing up?  What's that?  Did you date a lot of girls growing up?  Are you a big fellow yourself?  Well, I'm a truck driver.  I've got the standard trucker gut anymore, a little bit.  But, yeah, I didn't, I wouldn't say, you know, thought and wanted, but I dated a few going out.  How old were you when you got married, sir? 
[02:43:00]  Sir, how old were you?  Twenty-one.  Oh, twenty-one.  Twenty-one.  You were young.  Yes.  Yeah.  I see a lot of problems.  Yeah, this is brutal.  This is troubled.  Did you knock her up or something?  No.  Um, she came with 25-year-old sons to begin with.  What?  She came with 25-year-old sons to begin with.  Yeah.  So you got an instant family at 21 years old?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  She was 195 with two kids? 
[02:43:30]  How many guys did you have to fight off?  Um, there was a little bit of competition there, but...  Was there a bunch of...  Dude, was there a big, like, hanging bunt with stretch marks on it?  No.  No, man.  That would be in the Java category for me.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, 195 is a big gal.  I mean, not to tease her, but that's a hefty gal.  You know, that's a big girl.  You're just into the bigger girls. 
[02:44:00]  I mean, there's plenty of you out there.  It's chubby taste.  Dude, absolutely.  Look, we all love our mommies, and none of us want mommy to leave.  And a lot of times, you know, we find somebody who won't leave us.  That's very understandable.  With a matronly figure.  My mom was a real little gal.  No, no, no.  It's not about the figure, sir.  It's about the idea of a mommy.  It's about not wanting to be left or abandoned or left alone.  So you get somebody who will depend on us and not leave us.  You know, being a big fatso with two kids.  I mean, no disrespect.  I'm not speaking ill of your wife.  I'm sure she's lovely. 
[02:44:30]  She sure isn't going anywhere, though.  Absolutely not.  Especially the stairs involved.  Did you have a...  What kind of childhood did you have?  Me?  Yeah.  Incredibly happy.  In fact, my wife and in-laws refer to my folks as the Cleavers.  Really?  Boy, that's got to be a lot of fun.  What do they call her, Mr. Ed?  All right, sir.  Oh, wonderful. 
[02:45:00]  Wonderful.  All right.  Thank you, Jeremy.  All right.  Are we done with Jeremy?  Yeah, he is all right.  All right.  Oh, I wanted to know if it was the Cleavers or the friend on the show, Lumpy.  Brian from Austin.  Brian.  Where did you meet, Miss Arbuckle?  To kick him at his...  Kick him at his fat wife.  Right down the steps.  Good karate kick to the spine. 
[02:45:30]  Take that with some hot soup in your hand.  Sorry, sir.  Raphael Palmeiro.  Yeah.  Steroids.  I have never used steroids.  Period.  I do not know how to say it any more clearly than that.  Never.  Oops.  Here's a little more clearly.  Yes, I did.  How's that for clarity?  That was for March 17th when they did that congressional hearing on steroids.  Yeah.  Telling everybody he's never used steroids. 
[02:46:00]  And it came out today that...  Oops.  He tested positive, right?  Now, he's saying it's an accident or something, or it's a mistake.  What is he claiming here?  He said he was up on a ladder fixing a ceiling fan, naked.  And he fell off.  Right onto a needle?  And he had a steroid, yeah.  Big container of steroids, and it went up his ass.  And he had to go to the hospital.  Very embarrassing.  Raphael Palmeiro.  What's he really saying?  Yeah, that's what he was saying. 
[02:46:30]  No, he wasn't.  Well, let's see if we get our next question.  I actually thought for a second you might be serious.  I'm like, that's a good excuse if you ever get caught with a cock.  Exactly.  I was fixing something, and I fell on it.  That, by the way, is every excuse when someone comes to the hospital with a light bulb,  a doorknob, a candelabra, doorknobs up their ass.  They were always working on something.  Bosset.  On a ladder, naked, for some reason.  Curtain rod.  And they fell off, and it went up their ass.  It happened.  Football, small animal, stuffed animal. 
[02:47:00]  Sometimes I had to go to the hospital and get that Makita drill out of my ass,  because I was doing tin knocker work naked on my ladder.  You need some bits for it?  Yeah, you got some in the back, right?  I sure do.  Helpful birthday gift.  Let's just place them up each other's ass.  What has he got?  569 home runs.  3,018 hits.  Jesus.  Look at this legacy.  And now suspended for 10 games, that's it?  A little 10-game suspension, sure.  But I think if it happens again, you get more of a... 
[02:47:30]  Even baseball knows what's going on.  They're not stupid.  Of course.  The guys do steroids.  Don't make a fucking 200-hitter out of me.  All right, here we go.  From conference call yesterday, he's trying to explain himself.  I'm here to make it very clear that I had never intentionally used steroids.  Never, ever, period.  When I found out that I had failed the test under the new drug policy,  I filed a grievance and challenged the suspension on the basis that I had never intentionally taken a banned substance. 
[02:48:00]  Ultimately, although I never intentionally put a banned substance into my body,  the independent arbitrator ruled that I had to be suspended under the terms of the program.  I'm sure you will ask how I tested positive for a banned substance.  As I look back, I don't have the specific answer to give.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to explain to the arbitrator how the banned substance entered my body.  The arbitrator did not find that I used a banned substance intentionally. 
[02:48:30]  In fact, he said he found my testimony to be compelling,  but he's ruled that I could have any heavy burden posed on players who test positive under the new drug policy.  Compelling.  He found it to be words coming out of my mouth.  That means he didn't want to get punched in the face.  I've heard a lot of people say a lot of things.  I've got to be honest, that's the worst lie I've ever heard.  That was horrible. 
[02:49:00]  Do you understand?  I've had a lot of people tell lies, and I've listened to a lot of lies.  That is the absolute worst cover story I have ever heard.  Ever.  Ever.  Intentionally used them.  I was not able to convince the arbitrator that I didn't know how this...  So he's basically saying, look, I tried to tell the guy I didn't know what was going on.  He told me I was full of shit.  Yeah.  And apparently he was compelling...  The testimony compelled him to suspend me.  You fucking dope. 
[02:49:30]  I had no excuse whatsoever.  I could not possibly back up how this could happen to me accidentally.  But since I told him in English, and he understood it, I feel I am exonerated.  I can't believe he just shot that out.  I don't know how it got to my system.  Still right.  It happens all the time.  Yeah.  You're just walking.  It's in orange juice, I think.  Something.  No?  All right.  Well, we've got more audio here.  Well, I hope that the fans understand that I've worked very hard over a long 20-year career. 
[02:50:00]  I've put in a lot of time and a lot of effort into my career.  I made a mistake, and I'm facing it.  I hope that people learn from my mistake, and I hope that the fans forgive me.  But it was an accident.  Learn what?  You don't even know how you got it in your system.  How are we supposed to learn?  What lesson?  Don't ever accidentally get steroids in your system? 
[02:50:30]  That's not a very good lesson, Raphael.  How about this lesson?  Write shit down and read it before you say it in front of a microphone.  Let it pass a few people.  Exactly.  Say it into a mirror.  Who's on the phone here?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  You.  Hey.  Go.  Talk.  Yeah.  Hello?  Yes, sir.  You're on the phone.  Yeah, you.  Palmeiro, apparently, he said the phrase, never intentionally, around seven times. 
[02:51:00]  And then, also, there were some sports writers defending him, saying he's still a Hall of Famer.  And it could have been the Viagra he was taking, since he's the spokesman for that, that he tested positive.  Oh, Viagra doesn't make you fucking hit home runs, sir.  It helps you bang a little longer.  I will say, though, I still think he's a Hall of Famer.  I mean, look, the guy has almost 600 home runs.  Raphael Palmeiro.  Because of the roids.  Yeah, but you know what?  And I have to go back to the guys like this.  Steroids do not help you connect more. 
[02:51:30]  They do not, they don't help you hit for a higher average as far as, maybe they do on a certain level,  but I don't even give a fuck if they do take steroids.  Let them.  I think it helps tremendously.  With the home run stats, it does, but I'm saying it doesn't give you better hand-eye coordination.  And the guy has over 3,000 hits, man.  That's a lot more than steroids.  There you have it.  Let's say hi to Mike.  Hold on, what do you mean?  Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.  Kev says politics, I'm not sure what you mean.  Yes, Kev.  It's politics that tarnishes his image, and that will keep him out of the Hall of Fame. 
[02:52:00]  He's in there.  No, he's not in there yet.  I mean, he's going to be in there.  It doesn't matter.  Just let guys in.  Game suspension, that's it.  If this was something that would have kept him out of the Hall of Fame,  that would have been huge suspension.  Baseball knows that Bonds does steroids, that McGuire did steroids,  that all the big players did steroids.  They're not stupid.  Dude, with everybody, it's something.  I mean, look, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, some of the greatest players ever,  but there is a reality they didn't face black players.  No fault of their own, but it's like every era has shit that tarnishes what you did. 
[02:52:30]  You're facing guys on that level.  You're facing pitchers that take steroids.  You're facing, they never faced lefty relievers.  I mean, look, Ty Cobb, I still think is the greatest hitter ever,  but he didn't have to face lefty specialists in the eighth inning.  Why do you think Ty Cobb's the greatest hitter ever?  Because his average has...  We never saw him play.  How would we ever know that?  Well, I don't think everybody just lied in the record books.  Yeah, but...  I don't have to see things to know.  Maybe they all just threw like sissies back then. 
[02:53:00]  No.  Maybe it was just really easy to hit a baseball.  No, Opie.  Otherwise, the averages all would have been through the roof, and they weren't.  Ted Williams, the last guy he hit 400, that was, what, 55, 60 years ago.  But how did...  We don't even know how he really played,  because all the footage they have of him is him running really fast.  In fast motion.  In fast motion.  Black and white.  Georgia Peach.  All right.  But I still give him the nod over Tony Gwynn.  All right.  Mike in Tampa.  Tony Gwynn was a great hitter.  One of the greatest...  What about Rod Carew?  A great hitter as well. 
[02:53:30]  He's my favorite player.  Shut up, Mike.  Hold on, Mike.  You'll know when to talk.  Me and Jimmy are having a little thing.  Rod Carew had that very laid back...  He's still talking.  That very odd stance, kind of the bat just kind of lolling in his hands.  He's a great hitter, but he's a three-something hitter.  You know who I thought was a great hitter was Dave Kingman.  Well, he only hit for average.  That was a problem with Kingman.  He didn't have much power.  He was a real good singles hitter.  Excellent bunter.  Dave Kingman.  That guy had, what, 400 hits in his career.  Probably 350 of them were homers. 
[02:54:00]  It was awful.  Dude, he either...  It was either a strikeout or homer every single time.  He either hit it into the parking lot or he missed it by nine feet.  That's so true.  Hold on.  Now we're on to a little something here.  See, we can talk sports.  Sure can.  Dave Kingman was classic.  You just nailed it.  This guy was all or nothing always.  You nailed it.  He would miss these fastballs by nine feet sometimes.  He was terrible, Dave Kingman.  He, like, stood there like a question mark, remember, and just either crushed it or just 
[02:54:30]  missed by a mile.  Or he's throwing his batting helmet because the fucking team is walking back out on the  field.  Two runners left.  I really thought I came up with kind of an obscure player, but you went right with it.  I love it.  No, I know.  Kingman is.  Because Kingman was...  He would hit...  He would probably hit, like, what, 35, 40 homers a year in some of his better years  and still bat, like, 190.  He was abysmal.  Look, power hitters...  Was there a worse hitter than Dave Kingman?  No.  I mean, Reggie struck out a lot.  Power hitters have high strikeouts because they're fucking swinging really hard and they're 
[02:55:00]  trying to hit it out, but Kingman really was all or nothing.  That's hilarious.  I think if he hit a single, he actually didn't know what it was and he just walked back to  the dugout.  There were times that that would get a big laugh.  Jesus.  That was my best joke.  You know what?  I wasn't listening because I was thinking of something else he used to do, but I'm sorry.  He would sky him, too.  So, like, when he did miss the homer, he would get it just on the bat so it would go straight  up forever, forever, and then finally come down for a pop-out. 
[02:55:30]  I know.  I felt that before.  It's kind of...  Actually, it, like, kind of queefs a little.  What that sounds like?  You ever listen to your asshole and you do jumping jacks?  How is that even possible?  It sounds right, though.  With a stethoscope.  Prozac, Wackbag, what's up?  Hey, this is Bozac.  How's it going, buh-boy?  Oh, Bozac.  Bozac, Prozac.  Yeah, this sack of shit, Paul Merrow, if you listen to the rest of that conference call, 
[02:56:00]  he keeps claiming confidentiality as to why he's not answering any questions.  Did he really?  Yeah.  He's saying, nope, there's confidentiality involved.  I can't answer that.  Confidentiality?  The confidentiality is in place to protect him.  The lawyers can't talk about it.  You know, the commissioner can't talk about it.  But this prick can talk about it all he wants because it's his confidentiality.  And he just won't talk.  He's a sack of shit.  I love the fact that more of us are seeing right through this bullshit.  Yeah, punch in the clown, boy.  He's not even a good liar, man. 
[02:56:30]  That, to me, is insulting.  If you get caught, like Pete Rose, he's like, you know what?  When you get busted, sometimes you just got to go, all right, fuck it, I did it.  Yeah.  And the American public is pretty forgiving.  Sure.  They really are.  I mean, unless you're really arguing about it.  They're not buying that?  Who?  The room.  They're all freaking out at what Jimmy's saying.  Why?  It took Rose, like, 20 years to admit that.  That's what I'm saying.  Okay, okay.  You should admit it.  I'm saying you should admit, finally, when you get caught, like when Pete Rose gets caught,  he should have just come out and said, yeah, especially after a certain period of time, 
[02:57:00]  after a few years when he realized it wasn't going to go away,  just admit what you did, do your mea culpa.  People love that shit.  As long as you're not fucking kids.  I mean, if you do something stupid, you come out and go, look, I'm sorry, I fucked up.  The American public will forgive you normally.  Take that attack with the fucking kids.  But you know what I'm saying.  You know, all right, I had a couple.  America's very forgiving.  How was I supposed to know?  Little bastard, he's petting a puppy.  What am I supposed to do? 
[02:57:30]  Ask yourselves.  Petting them all sexy.  He did this under the chin.  Leno had a couple good jokes last night, real fast.  He's also the spokesman for Viagra, did you know that?  No, he is.  So he's on steroids and Viagra.  You know what that means?  He doesn't even need a bat anymore.  He doesn't even need a bat.  That is a great joke.  Funny.  You know what's so stupid, though?  The audience is laughing, thinking that Leno's making a joke that he is also the spokesperson for Viagra. 
[02:58:00]  Yeah, they lose their minds over that.  Listen, they're losing their minds over something that's just true.  Morons don't even know.  That's just a setup for a real joke that's not funny in itself.  Listen.  He's also the spokesman for Viagra.  Did you know that?  You know what it is?  I think that with something like that, because of the obvious tie in steroids, power, Viagra, power, bat dick,  I think people made actually a very fast connection there.  Yeah?  Yeah, it was just a weird visual.  You're giving so much credit to Americans.  You know what, though?  He's on steroids.  He also takes Viagra.  It's just an obvious connection to me. 
[02:58:30]  It's strength and strength.  I don't think it's that big a laugh obvious connection.  Maybe not.  Yeah, maybe not.  Yeah, I don't know.  Maybe they're just surprised to hear anybody saying that on TV, because I think Letterman  made a funny point about his helmet.  You know what you call baseball players that don't take steroids?  Dodgers.  But you know...  Whoa, hey, that's a little outrageous.  I'll tell you one thing I've got to say.  I'm not a Letterman fan.  Did anybody see Bonnie's set on Letterman?  She killed it.  She fucking killed it.  Damn it, I missed it.  Voss's wife-to-be was on Letterman on Friday, and she killed it. 
[02:59:00]  She killed it.  We all stood around TVs at the Comedy Cellar.  Check that out.  And that dumb Voss is trying to hush everybody, because he knew she was going to go to...  What did you think of this one?  He was going to...  He had to know every line.  Yeah.  But she really did kill it.  Voss trying to shut up drunks at the bar.  That was hilarious.  Oh, he makes me sick.  And Voss just stood on the bar.  Everybody felt like he was a little statuette with his little feet and washboard abs and a fat stomach.  I don't know how he pulls it off.  Fucking thorax.  I just got the invitation to the Voss reception for their wedding. 
[02:59:30]  Caroline's?  Yeah, I got that.  I'm supposed to be best man at the wedding in Canada, Western Canada, but I'm shooting the night before.  Are you getting married in Canada?  Bonnie's Canadian.  I just didn't want to do it with your family.  Yeah, so?  Well, she's hot and look at him, so she says where the wedding is and he agrees.  But you're shooting the night before.  Or you could shoot up to Western Canada from where you're at.  It's very possible, but I don't know.  Because to shoot up that morning for the wedding that day, that could be a problem.  Right.  You got to go through customs and all that shit. 
[03:00:00]  You got to figure it out.  It's your boy.  Even if I'm shooting, it's the only thing I'm going to figure it out.  Oh, HBO or Voss.  Yeah.  They don't understand.  I'll fucking send a card, a video note.  Congratulations, stupid.  I'll just say, you could be best man on closed circuit TV.  I'd be happy to.  That could be really funny.  Like an award thing.  Yeah.  I'd go, hey, I'd like to, I'd thank everybody.  Sorry, I can't be there, but.  But it's almost like, do I want to be best man and not be able, like, what if, what if,  like, silly, but what if there's, like, an hour or two hour rain delay or some shit  like that, and then going through customs is a problem, or, and you just don't know.  So what's he going to do? 
[03:00:30]  Get another best man?  I'm his only friend.  Who else are you going to get?  That's what I was thinking.  Oh, no.  Who could he possibly get?  I don't, I mean, because Voss, Voss probably had to ask me because I know him so well.  But I, I think that Voss.  I don't, you got a suit?  Believe me.  I'm a little worried because in the last year or two, I got close with Voss playing a lot  of golf.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Got a suit.  And that's all, and that's all it takes to be Voss's friend, play a round of golf,  and now you're his best friend.  He'll ask some executive at Comedy Central first, that worm.  He'll probably ask, like, fucking one of the upper management. 
[03:01:00]  You know who my best man was?  Yeah.  You guys, we've got a big star that's been waiting way too long on the phone, and we  wonder why we don't get guests.  Brian Hurta.  Oh, hi, Brian.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  There he is.  Sorry to make you wait, sir.  That's all right.  We loved, we loved you the last time you called our program.  Of course, you're an indie racer.  Yes, I am.  And you won in, what, Michigan?  Yeah.  Yeah, just this weekend.  Congratulations.  Oh.  Thank you.  How'd that go?  How far ahead were you?  Uh, I don't remember the exact, it was about four feet. 
[03:01:30]  That's it?  That's it.  After, yeah, 400 miles.  Well, that's, that's indie, Anthony.  Sometimes they win by an inch.  Who was the second place?  Uh, my teammate, Dan Weldon.  Oh, well, there you go.  And helping each other out.  Well, he drives the XM car too, right?  Yeah.  Yes, I do.  When you're, when you're in a race like that, do you get annoyed if somebody is tailgating  you because of the speed?  No, no, because otherwise I'd just be annoyed all the time.  Yeah, they're always right on their ass. 
[03:02:00]  And then that's a slipstream.  We're always really close together, especially on those big super speedways like Michigan.  Brian, did you have to take a leak or a dump during this race?  No, I didn't.  No, I didn't.  What do you do if you do?  See, right away, huh?  Yeah.  Well, no, it's an interesting question.  What do you want us to talk about?  How fast you were going?  What your average speed was?  I don't know that crap.  I want to know, like, you're in a car for 400 miles.  How long does that take usually?  That's what people ask me more than anything else.  What do you do if you have to go to the bathroom? 
[03:02:30]  Absolutely.  Because it's like an astronaut in a way.  It's like, what are they, because I heard that, like, one of the astronauts, they were  on a takeoff, they were on a delay.  The guy just whizzed himself because there was nothing to do.  They were sitting, they were ready to take off.  What a drag.  It's finally your big moment on the space shuttle and you're in your pants.  Panting yourself like a five-year-old.  Yeah.  Five.  Well, obviously, I go before I race.  And then, I've been fine every time except one time.  And, but I know a lot of guys, you know, if you gotta go, you gotta go. 
[03:03:00]  Just go right in your suit.  Yeah.  A lot of guys do every race.  Really?  Yeah.  I was coming back from the Hansons a week and a half ago.  And, yeah, I had to go to the bathroom and I had a Starbucks cup and I went, man.  I had a nice coffee that was done with some ice cubes still in it and I just filled that  thing up twice.  Twice.  Twice.  Threw the first one out and that sprayed all over the side of my car and then I had a  urine bomb for the second one.  I waited until I was going like 70, 80 miles an hour when traffic finally, you know, got 
[03:03:30]  better and just let it fly.  I'm not that talented at 200.  No, no, you shouldn't be throwing urine at me.  And I don't have a cup holder.  Dude, my friend was on his way to a gig and he was driving, this guy Jim Florentine, and  he's whizzing into a cup, but he didn't realize there was a hole in the bottom of it.  So he peed all over his jeans on his way to a gig.  He had to take his jeans off while he was driving and put them on the top dashboard and  put the heat on to drive it with his heat.  Oh, that must have smelled great.  But do you guys, I mean, you don't wear the pens, obviously, but you've got to have something 
[03:04:00]  in there, no?  No.  You just try to hold it.  It's not like something that regularly happens, but a lot of guys do.  How much water are you drinking?  Well, I drink a lot before the race.  A lot, but you sweat so much that you don't have, once you get going, you don't have to  go.  You just sweat it all out.  Yeah.  How stringent are they with safety?  Because a friend of mine and I were talking, he's a big race fan.  And do you feel like a lot of people would think that the safety rules have become kind 
[03:04:30]  of lax, but he was saying that, well, it depends on the place because sometimes they get like,  you know, it's not what it would be.  What do you mean?  Yeah.  Like, is the safety standards kind of lax compared to what they were at one point, or are they  not quite up to snuff?  No, I think that they've done a lot to make the cars safer.  They've gotten safer and safer.  I mean, I've done this now for, it's 12 years I've been doing this.  And so, yeah, I've seen a lot of change over that time. 
[03:05:00]  And actually, we're quite a bit, we're probably at least 15 miles an hour slower now than we  were seven or eight years ago.  Yeah.  They've actually slowed the cars down because they were getting, the speed was so high that  it was really, they're starting to have a lot of problems.  How hard is it to adjust after that?  I mean, I'm sure you've gotten this question before.  You're doing, you know, 200 miles an hour, then you get back into a car after the race to  go home.  How bad do you just want to just smash everybody's face on the highway?  No, it's totally different.  Yeah, we, I, uh, no, I'm actually pretty relaxed. 
[03:05:30]  You told us last time that.  My wife would say I'm a little impatient, but normally I'm pretty relaxed when I'm driving  on the street.  Well, you told us.  I don't drive super fast.  I mean, I get people that get in the car with me and, like, they can't get the seatbelt  on fast enough.  Yeah, they think they're going to go crazy.  They think I'm going to drop, you know, drop the hammer in first gear and take off like  I'm fat out of hell.  Well, Brian, you told us, uh, last time when you're not racing that you actually drive  a minivan.  No, I didn't say that.  I don't drive a minivan. 
[03:06:00]  No.  Well, you are a car expert.  I got to ask you something.  Uh, what would you think of a guy who drove a Saturn?  This is a loaded question I'm walking into.  Um, I mean, not as bad as, like, a Volkswagen Cabriolet, but not totally a dude's car.  Everyone knows that's the car of the faggot.  You're basically saying, and I think Brian is saying that I would look more masculine  if I drove a tampon with wheels.  I definitely, I think you're right, so I hate myself. 
[03:06:30]  I mean, there's worse choices, you know, like, you know, probably like a dude in a VW Beetle  or something, but...  Yeah.  Are those gay cars, you think, the Volkswagens?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's be honest, yeah.  Hey, we got audio of you winning in Michigan, but we hear it's pretty cool, actually.  We're the only ones on this team who had to want a race this year, and we wanted to make  that right, and it's just awesome.  I can't thank XM satellite radio enough. 
[03:07:00]  They are the coolest sponsor in the world, and I promised them I'd get them a win this year,  and we did it, and...  Hey, Brian, let me go back to that one pit stop that you had to make under green,  and then the yellow came out.  What was going through your mind as you were pedaling as fast as you could to get back out  in front?  Well, I didn't want to see that yellow.  It was really close, but luckily I was able to stay on the lead lap, and then everybody  cycled back through their pit stop.  It worked out, so it really didn't change anything.  We went right back to the front, but it was a little bit tense there for a minute.  Popular win here at Michigan for Brian Hurd, and now A.G.L.  has all their cars in victory lane. 
[03:07:30]  Wow, Brian, that was you screaming?  You know, yeah, that was me screaming.  I hadn't heard that interview.  My voice was definitely up a couple octaves on that.  I must have been excited.  Well, very excited.  And I noticed that someone was conducting a normal interview with you.  Yeah.  I didn't ask what I had to do if I had to go to the basketball.  I know.  Well, what do you want?  Hey, what did that guy mean with the yellow?  I don't know anything about racing.  He said you used to try something with the yellow.  What did that mean?  What was the problem on the track?  There was an accident, and so they put a yellow flag out. 
[03:08:00]  Everybody had to slow down, and they did it when I was in the pits, which is really a big disadvantage.  You don't want to be in the pits when the yellow comes out.  No.  What's the question?  I almost went a lap down.  Why is that a disadvantage?  Because you can't pass on the yellow, so I would have come out of the pits and then a lap down.  You'd have to sit behind the whole crowd that just went by him at a very slow speed.  Yeah, you want to come tearing ass out of there.  Oh.  Right.  What question would you like us to ask you? 
[03:08:30]  I think we're asking.  No, no, because you.  I didn't really prepare anything for that.  No, well, I mean, you said, like, there's a bunch of questions you're always asked, like, do you take a leak when you're racing?  What other questions are you asked?  Well, you know, sometimes, like, people will ask, you know, if I drive the car to the track myself.  Yeah, street legal.  I get that, yeah.  Or a cocktail party sometimes with my wife.  People ask her if she ever gets to drive it. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, God.  Can I point out how lazy this radio program is, that we actually just said to you, hey, what do other people ask you?  We're not good interviewers.  Hey, what do other people ask you?  And what do you say to them?  So, basically, we suck, and we'd like you to conduct your own interview, and we'll get credit for it.  We really are awful.  Well, do you know anything about the IndyCar series?  I absolutely do.  You do?  Yes.  What do you know about it?  Congratulations, he won.  In what?  Michigan.  Very good. 
[03:09:30]  It was a big win for me, because it had been, since 2003, since I'd won a race, it had been a little while.  How are you doing in the points?  Pretty good.  We're up to fifth.  Yeah?  That's not bad.  Who's in the lead?  Not too bad.  My teammate, Dan Weldon, who finished right behind me in the race there.  Did he want to get past you?  Were you blocking him?  Were you cocking him?  Oh, no.  Yeah, no, he was trying to get past, for sure.  He was.  You guys don't play it like his job is to keep the guy in third away from you.  No, like the teammate thing, we actually talk a lot during the weekend about our cars, 
[03:10:00]  and hey, I tried the springs or whatever to help each other get our cars set up better.  Once the race starts, it's every man for himself.  You're not really a team anymore.  Right.  I got XM Radio people calling me up Monday after races wanting to know why we haven't won a race yet.  So the heat was on.  I had to win a race for him.  I promised him I would this year.  That's a good one.  That is awesome.  Brian, is there like a groupie scene with drivers, man?  I know every sport has them. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, no, there definitely is.  Nice.  Do you partake?  No, no, I can't.  He's married.  He's married, Jimmy.  I got two kids.  Oh, he's married.  Okay.  Yeah.  Married man.  No, it's out there.  I mean, the single guys definitely, they have a good life.  Are they hot chicks?  Are they hot chicks or pigs?  Oh, no.  Come on.  They're hot.  It's not NASCAR.  He's getting like quality high class chicks.  Quality trim.  There's some pigs too, probably.  With all their teeth and everything, right?  You know, yeah. 
[03:11:00]  All right.  Let's say hi to Tom in Kentucky.  Tom?  How you doing, boys?  All right.  Hey, Brian.  Man, first of all, I want to say I'm a big fan.  Congratulations.  I'm going to be in Kentucky on the 14th, and I got pit passes and everything, so we'll  be definitely out there supporting you.  Early in the race when you hit the marbles, man, I mean, how freaked out were you?  I mean, did you think that you were going to get back in there?  Well, yeah, I had a really good car.  I mean, I had the best car that day, so I would have felt like I hadn't done a good job 
[03:11:30]  for my guys if I didn't get that thing to victory lane.  It was such a dominant car, and so, you know, we had a couple problems at times, but on  a 400-mile race, that's always going to happen.  Did you get out of the groove and spin a little bit?  Well, no, but I got up high a couple times and tried to pass some cars and slid, but that  happens.  I mean, that's all part of the race.  What was that marble comment?  I don't get it.  Marble, that's what we refer to when we got through the corner, a little bit to the rubber 
[03:12:00]  off the tires actually wear off.  Okay.  And it's like little rubber balls, and if you go up above where people are normally  running, all those little balls are up there, and it's like you drive up on a marble.  The car just has no grip and slid.  Yeah.  You ever watch the cars going around?  You wonder, why are they all in the same little, like, track on the track?  It's because the rest of the track is shit.  Right.  It's all very scary up there.  You drive on a road that's plowed with no snow, and you drive onto the snow, all of a sudden 
[03:12:30]  you have no grip.  That's what it looks like.  Oh, that's very interesting.  Why can't they just make tires that don't wear out?  Oh, boy.  Well, they could make them so they didn't wear out, but then they'd be a lot harder, so  they wouldn't have as much grip.  Oh, okay.  They wouldn't stick to the road.  So then we'd go a lot slower.  Well, you guys change tires depending on temperature and track conditions and weather.  Oh, yeah.  The tires, the Firestone tires, they're a big part of the deal, of the equation that, you  know, how we tune the car and everything.  Tires are made or... 
[03:13:00]  They last a set of tires about 75 or 80 miles for us, and then they're done.  That's it.  Then they're done.  That's it.  Then we put another set on.  But that's how long a tank of fuel lasts.  The tires are made to last exactly one tank of fuel, because we've got to come in the  pit to put fuel in any place.  Yeah.  Well, we can change tires in that much time, too.  How much fuel do you burn in the race?  Well, 35 gallons at a time.  Or 30...  Let's see.  I don't know. 
[03:13:30]  In the 400-mile race, probably about 180 gallons.  Wow.  180 gallons.  That's a lot of cash.  Yeah, just about 2 1⁄2 miles a gallon is what we get.  XM paying the bill?  Yes, they are.  They say...  Very good.  So they must be paying the bill.  Let's say hi to Rob in Chicago.  He has a good question for you.  Rob, go ahead.  Hey, Brian.  How are you doing?  I've been a big fan ever since Champ Car used to see you every year at Road America and  wish you were back there.  Anyway, I was happy to see you guys stand up against the Danica bandwagon and all the attention 
[03:14:00]  that she's gotten since she hasn't won a race since she was like 17 years old.  I think it's a little sickening.  Anyway, it's good to see you win again.  And I hope that Honda does stick around in the league with you guys.  You guys have obviously been a powerhouse team.  And also, is Kestroneves as gay as he seems?  Oh, okay.  That's a lot.  Well, thanks for the comments about the Danica stuff.  And it wasn't really about Danica.  It was more about the league and how they were... 
[03:14:30]  Wait, what did you say, Brian, for us newbies?  Well, it's not anything I said.  Okay, now I've got to tell the story.  Uh-oh.  Well, Danica is the chick that got a ton of attention.  Yeah, Danica races with us, and she's been getting a huge amount of attention because  she's, you know, she's a female driver.  And by the way, let me add, she's not hot.  They're trying to make believe she's this, like, sex symbol.  She's not hot.  She's a female driver that's not ugly, but she's...  Relatively speaking.  Have you seen some of the past chicks that have been in racing? 
[03:15:00]  She's not that sexy, though, man.  They're trying to make her into a sex symbol.  It's not happening.  Well, anyway.  Yet I digress.  And I know damn well you agree with me, but that's okay.  But the league was starting to...  Because she was getting so much attention, the league was starting to separate her out  at the autograph sessions.  And they had a...  In Milwaukee, we went to the...  We were supposed to go to the autograph session.  They had a sign out front.  And the sign said, Danica Patrick with an arrow one way, and all other drivers with an arrow 
[03:15:30]  the other way.  What?  And our team said, hey, you know, you guys are the league.  You know, you're not supposed to be treating anybody differently.  And our guys aren't all other drivers.  We've got four good drivers on our team.  Guys who, you know, we got the Indy...  Last year's champion on the team.  We got the guy who won the Indy 500 this year.  And they're not just all other drivers.  So the team told us we couldn't go to the autograph session.  So we did our own autograph session 50 feet away out of our merchandise trailer. 
[03:16:00]  And the media made a big deal about it and said we were jealous of Danica and we were  all a bunch of whiners.  And we got all kinds of flack from the media about it.  But then, like this guy that called in, you know, the fans were like, hey, you know,  good for you guys for standing up for what you believe.  And now the league doesn't do the autograph sessions that way anymore.  So it was too bad it had to come to that.  But at least it worked out.  Hey, Brian, did she go to the autograph session that day or did she stay with you guys?  Yeah, no, no.  She went to the autograph session. 
[03:16:30]  But she wasn't...  She's not looking for any controversy.  And the problem wasn't with her at all.  She's actually, you know, she's taken a lot of pressure this year just because all the  heat on her to try and win a race.  And we didn't have any issue with her.  It was just the team with the league.  You think she'll ever win one?  I think she could.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I think she's doing...  Actually, she's doing a very good job.  All right.  And what was that other question that guy had where you don't want to touch that one?  No, no. 
[03:17:00]  Actually, Julio's one of those single guys that he's doing all right.  Okay.  Ah, see.  There you go.  There goes back to the groupies thing.  Okay.  How old were you when you started driving?  Legally?  Oh, no, no, no.  I mean professionally.  Yeah, professionally.  When I turned 18, I got my racing license.  Oh, okay.  You started young.  Well, that's actually kind of old.  Some of these kids now are like...  You get emancipated from your parents.  It's basically like getting divorced from your parents.  You get declared an adult at like 15, 16 so that they can start racing. 
[03:17:30]  Today's actually my birthday.  Is it?  Yeah.  Happy birthday.  Oh, thank you.  All right, Brian.  This just in from ELO.  IndyCar racing is alive and well on Extreme 152.  And the next race is what, Sunday?  No, two weeks from this past Sunday, right?  August 15th.  Right.  Kentucky Speedway, 3.30 p.m. on the East Coast, and that would be on Extreme 152.  And don't forget, Hertha.com. 
[03:18:00]  H-E-R-T-A.com.  There you go.  Thank you, Brian.  Hey, thanks, guys.  You guys are awesome.  Take care, buddy.  We'll talk to you soon.  Good luck to you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Continued success.  There he goes.  Brian Hurta.  Take a race car driver.  How about that?  All right.  We're going to take a break, and Rob Dibble is going to check in to say hi.  I got a gift, by the way.  And tell us about the Rafael Palmeiro situation.  Yes, Jimmy.  It's a Starbucks card.  I just want to say thank you.  It says, happy birthday, Jim.  It's not your birthday.  It is.  If you register the card, I'll throw some money on there once in a while. 
[03:18:30]  Let me buy your coffee.  Seems a fair trade for the daily laughter and the help of my orgasms.  So I'd like to thank the young lady from Washington.  Oh, lady.  Oh, lady.  Look at you.  Gee.  This is what his scam is.  He says it's his birthday every day.  Where's that birthday song?  People send him shit.  Do we still have that?  It's not a scam.  It is a scam.  It's not your birthday.  Chris on Long Island wanted to sing a happy birthday. 
[03:19:00]  So he did it like this for you.  Happy birthday, little Jimmy.  Happy birthday to you.  On the phone, Rob Dibble. 
[03:19:30]  Rob.  What's going on?  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  It's little Jimmy Norton.  How are you, sir?  Oh, I'm hanging in there.  You guys got a big story dropped on your lap today, huh?  Yeah.  It was lovely.  Go to the Hall of Fame over the weekend, and it's the Hall of Shame on Monday.  Hall of Shame.  Oh, look at you.  Very good.  Now, what's the deal?  I don't get it.  I listened to some of the audio from the press conference yesterday that Rafael Palmaro did, 
[03:20:00]  and he's saying that he didn't really do steroids knowingly.  What do you know about this?  Well, you know, he's an older guy, and since 2003, Major League Baseball has been testing  the players.  I mean, first of all, he's one of the smarter players that's ever played.  You've got to be smarter than that.  And he had Hall of Fame credentials two years ago, so there's no real reason for him to be  used in anything.  That's why I'm not going to defend these guys anymore.  I mean, I used to say, well, yeah, you know, there's over-the-counter supplements, 
[03:20:30]  but then we had Rob Manfred on the show last Thursday, and he talked about any GNC or vitamin  or any kind of place like that, if there's any kind of precursors or anything that's steroid-related  in their stuff, their supplements, then they're going to jail.  So it's against the law for them to sell it to these guys.  So he had to get it from somewhere other than a GNC or some over-the-counter stuff.  So that's why I'm not going to defend the guy.  You know, to say I didn't intentionally take steroids is just a joke. 
[03:21:00]  I mean, the guy, he's too good for that, and it just gives the game a bad name.  So I'm not going to defend these guys anymore.  Did you not believe him?  Because I heard the press conference.  I was actually surprised because he sounded very, very convincing.  Yeah, and he said he convinced the arbitrator.  You know, well, you could be a good lawyer when you're done playing baseball, you know,  but that doesn't matter to me.  What matters to me is that, you know, whenever his Hall of Fame status was brought up,  I was one of the guys that said, hey, listen, he's not like McGuire or Bonds, 
[03:21:30]  these guys that got really big in their old age.  He's stayed pretty much the same.  And he's put up huge numbers his entire career.  But when you read Jose Canseco's book, Canseco says in 1993,  and we're going back 12 years, that I used to inject this guy with steroids.  So who are you going to believe?  I'm going to believe Canseco because Canseco never got caught using steroids when he played.  He admitted it after he was done playing and said he was the godfather of steroids in baseball.  So I'm believing Canseco because everybody ripped him for the book,  but every guy that he's mentioned in his book now is, you know, 
[03:22:00]  either come up dirty or, like Palmeiro, has just gotten dirty.  Do you think, why did Canseco rat everybody out?  I mean, obviously just for the money, but why would he just, like, screw with guys?  Now that he's done, why would he try to screw up people who are still playing?  To know Jose, he thinks there was this big conspiracy against him.  And that, you know, he says he was blackballed from baseball.  That's the book.  Not just to out everybody. 
[03:22:30]  I mean, the steroids is only two chapters in his book,  and it's not a really big part of the book.  He told people, he's more of a guy, he's a proponent of steroids.  Properly, under doctor's care.  And if you saw the HBO Real Sports special, they talked about, you know,  using steroids over the last 30, 40 years.  There's no medical study that can prove that it's damaging to your health if done right.  So there's conflicting reports on steroids. 
[03:23:00]  But it's illegal in baseball, and that's why I'm so pissed at Rafael Palmeiro.  It's been illegal since 2003.  Canseco just talks when they weren't illegal.  And so I don't think he was so much outing people as much as he was into his conspiracy theory stuff.  All right.  Yeah, so you were pretty much saying steroids, no big deal, right?  No.  Steroids are a huge deal.  And it's even worse because kids of America look up to these guys like Ben Caminiti and Jose Cateco and Palmeiro, 
[03:23:30]  and to have these guys, you know, come out and either get caught using them  or, you know, die from using them and other drugs is just awful.  No, it's awful.  That's the one thing that pisses me off is that kids look up to baseball players,  and Palmeiro let everybody down.  Yeah.  Should he be in the Hall of Fame is the big question today.  No.  No, absolutely not.  Really?  No.  Absolutely not.  I've got to ask you, Rob.  We were talking last time.  I think that you were saying, I was saying that should the records be changed,  like McGuire's home run record, is that tarnished?  And you were saying no.  No, because McGuire was never caught using them. 
[03:24:00]  He's outed in a book.  But he was never caught while they're – you know, it's such a gray area.  But they weren't illegal in baseball, whether it was Andro or creatine or steroids.  They weren't illegal until 2003.  So McGuire was out of the game by then.  So you can't really go back and say, well, you know, we heard you were using them.  I mean, that's like saying, you know,  you heard some of these guys in the 60s and 70s were on amphetamines,  because I know they were.  But that's the thing Kevin Kennedy and I have been saying for months, 
[03:24:30]  is that that's a bigger problem in baseball than steroids.  I mean, how many guys are they caught doing the steroids?  Less than 1% of the guys in the big leagues.  But I'm going to say 75% of the guys in the big leagues are probably on speed.  And that's the biggest problem in the sport.  With this stuff, and I was saying before,  every era has things that have tarnished the images of the players.  Whether it's many, many years ago when they didn't play with blacks or Dominicans,  it was only white guys, which was no fault of their own.  I mean, every era you go over, it seems like there's going to be something. 
[03:25:00]  So, I mean, shouldn't baseball just say, well, look,  I mean, they are facing much stronger pitchers now.  The pitchers are a lot of times juiced.  And, you know, most people are probably doing it.  Yeah, but you know what?  That's why the game needs to be cleaned up.  So that we have as even a playing field as possible.  And I mean as possible,  because you're never going to get guys to stop, you know,  drinking 10 cups of coffee during the game.  Some guys that I played with used to go up and drink a beer during the game.  I mean, that's the way baseball is.  Baseball is like a softball league. 
[03:25:30]  Wait, why drink a beer?  Just to calm the nerves a little bit?  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  And you know guys that just drink coffee during the whole game  to just keep that speed head going?  No kidding.  There's guys that would run up every half inning and drink a cup of coffee.  What about Red Bull?  Just to get that caffeine to kick in.  What about Red Bull?  Red Bull is a new supplement.  Red Bull is like...  You drink one Red Bull, it's like 10 cups of coffee.  That's what I'm saying.  It's like liquid crank, man.  That stuff keeps you awake for days.  Listen, I mean, it's common knowledge that back in Willie Mays era, 
[03:26:00]  they used to do this thing called red juice.  Put a drop under their tongue.  It's an amphetamine.  I mean, so for many, many years,  players have been doing that kind of stuff.  And that's why I'm just for...  You know what?  You need to show society that you can clean up your sport.  And if guys like Palmeiro and big-name guys like that get busted,  I'm all for it.  So your criteria is he would be allowed in the Hall of Fame  if he didn't get caught?  Yeah, absolutely.  That's really interesting.  Because obviously there's other guys out there putting up big numbers 
[03:26:30]  that will be in the Hall of Fame that are doing exactly what Palmeiro's doing.  And there's guys that I won't name that, if you look back at their stats,  they went from 16 home runs to 35 in one year.  Yeah.  And those are guys that statistically you have to look at them  and say, how did that guy do that?  Right.  Because you just don't become a great home run hitter overnight.  If you look back at Hank Aaron and guys like that,  Hank never hit 50 home runs in a year.  Right.  And now guys are hitting 50, 60, 70, 73.  I mean, that's what you have to look at. 
[03:27:00]  What was the most homers Hank did in one season?  40 maybe?  I think 49.  Oh, it was that high.  Okay.  Yeah, he got up close to 50, but he never hit 50.  Gotcha.  Your own opinion, you think Giambi's back on the juice?  No.  No?  You know what?  I know Jason, and he's had to deal with it, and that's the thing.  There's a guy that admitted using it on a grand jury testimony in the 2000-2001,  but he's too smart to be caught now.  I mean, if he were to be caught now, he'd be blackballed from the game.  Yeah. 
[03:27:30]  You know, not maybe by the game.  He'd get his 10-game suspension, but the fans would never forgive him.  But, Rob, he was looking a little desperate there for a while.  Yeah, he was looking terrible.  He wasn't hitting, and it looked like they were going to throw him in the minor for a while.  And you start thinking, it doesn't matter.  I'm going to be thrown out of the league anyway because I stink.  And then all of a sudden, he's a hitting machine.  Well, I mean, but he's doing it on the up and up now.  It's a little bit harder.  But if you look at his home runs, they're not going 450.  Yeah.  They're going like 340, and they're barely getting over the wall.  Right.  I mean, a lot of his home runs that happened in the last month, those 14 home runs he hit 
[03:28:00]  in one month, barely got over the wall.  In fact, a couple of them hit the wall and bounced over.  Good point, sir.  So, you know, he is big, but he's not as strong as he used to be.  Now, who do you think, as we were talking before, greatest hitter of all time, if you  had to name him?  Hank Aaron.  Really?  Hank Aaron.  Almost 4,000 hits.  You know, all the home runs.  2,300 RBIs.  24-time All-Star.  What about Tony Gwynn and Rod Carew?  Rod Carew got the bat on the ball every single time he was up. 
[03:28:30]  Didn't he hit, like, 80 career home runs?  No, but Tony Gwynn, Wade Boggs, Pete Rose, Ted Williams, those guys, they saw the ball  so well.  You just didn't like those slap hitters, did you?  Rod Carew, man, his hits were awful.  Let's be honest.  No, Rod Carew is amazing.  Yeah, but let's be honest.  A lot of those were just slap singles.  I hate it.  When you're watching a baseball game and you watch Rod Carew slap another single, it's  like, boring.  He's peppering the ball.  Yeah, yeah.  No, but see, that's baseball.  That's baseball.  A guy like Rod Carew can get 3,000 hits and get in the Hall of Fame because he knows how 
[03:29:00]  to play the game.  Right.  And that's what Ryan Sandberg in his induction speech talked about.  Guys have forgotten how to play the game.  It's like basketball.  It's ESPN.  They really, really glamorized the dunk.  So guys can't shoot anymore.  They don't pass the ball that well anymore.  They don't dribble that well anymore.  The game has changed.  It's the same thing in baseball.  The best thing about the steroid thing is that now you have to play more of a complete  game and go back to the way baseball used to be played.  And so that's, to me, that's the way it should be. 
[03:29:30]  Ryan Sandberg talked about it.  Listen, the guy had 282 home runs and just barely over 1,000 RBIs hit 285 for his career.  He's in the Hall of Fame.  Right.  So he can laugh at the guys playing today that hit the home runs and then go home and  want to see them on TV.  When we were talking about great hitters, we brought up the name Dave Kingman.  But that was more for average.  Yeah.  He went for the high average.  Kind of like Rob Deere.  You know, we were talking about Dave Kingman.  You got to repeat your line for Rob Dibble, what you said about Kingman.  I don't remember what I said.  He would either hit a homer into the parking lot or miss the ball by nine feet. 
[03:30:00]  There was no in-between with Dave Kingman.  It really was.  You were either cheering him or you wanted to lop his head off.  This guy would hit, what, like 52 homers in a year and still bat 180.  But, see, those guys kept me in the major leagues a few extra years.  Yeah.  Because they missed so many times.  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Those were the easy strikeouts.  Those damn Tony Gwynn guys that pissed me off.  Yeah, Gwynn, a lot of people, see, I was about to say him great as hitter.  I guess Hank Aaron might be the best bet.  But I was thinking like a singles header. 
[03:30:30]  Would you put Ty Cobb?  I still would put him.  Oh, yeah.  Ty Cobb was amazing.  That was the thing.  And, you know, for you listeners, you guys are in New York.  You've got to go up to Cooperstown to go in there and see not just how great those players used to be,  it's the equipment they used.  They used these ridiculous bats that were the same length and width the whole length of the bat.  You know, Dave Ruth used to swing a 42-ounce bat.  To give you a comparison, Tony Gwynn swung a 31-ounce bat. 
[03:31:00]  Wow.  So, you know, Dave Ruth was just an amazing athlete because he was only 6'2  and about 210 pounds.  And he had these spindly little legs.  And it was all muscle.  Yeah, it was all muscle.  The guy just went out there and he hit, won 100 games as a pitcher.  That was baseball.  So when we get back to that, I think it'll really be America's game again.  Very good.  Another big story we've got to get your opinion on.  Barry Bond's basically saying he's out until next year.  What's that about?  Well, he's got so many personal problems off the field, that's the best thing he could do. 
[03:31:30]  Yeah, but...  Stay the heck away from the game this year.  But do you think it's the steroid thing?  He's trying to clean up his body?  I mean, what's the...  No, because he's being tested right now.  Yeah.  So he got tested...  Oh, so he's being tested...  Oh, he's being tested even though he's not playing this year.  Yeah, they just...  In fact, they took a urine and blood sample from him, I think, like a month ago.  Man, they would love to catch him on steroids.  So there's a bunch of these guys that don't...  You know, the one thing that bothers me is I know they've known about Rafael Palmeiro for  a couple of weeks because there was rumors that we thought it was going to be Barry Bonds  because they said it was somebody that was rehabbing. 
[03:32:00]  Right.  But they knew, and then this is the one thing that shows people that the owners and the commissioner  still run the game, that the day after the Hall of Fame, and after this guy got his 3,000 hits,  I think they knew before he got his 3,000 hits, that they dropped the bomb on everybody.  Wow.  I'm sorry.  I'm a big Yankee fan, but I've got to be honest.  I mean, the Yankees of 96, 97, I love...  This Yankee team, even though they're a very good team, I just can't stand. 
[03:32:30]  It's like...  What are you...  Like Brian Cashman going out and just grabbing big-name players.  What are they doing?  It's awful.  Well, what have they used?  24 different pitchers this year?  It's just Jared Wright.  And I know I talked to you guys back in spring training.  Jared Wright, Carl Povano, they've been trying to trade Carl Povano while he's hurt.  That's how bad they want to get rid of him.  They dropped $40 million on him, over $20 million on Jared Wright.  They just want those guys out of town.  So you'll forget that they signed $60 million to those two losers.  It's unbelievable. 
[03:33:00]  How much to Kevin Brown?  Kevin Brown was still making part of that $105 million deal the Dodgers gave him years ago.  Oh, what a disgrace.  So you've got a lot of money invested in those guys.  But you know what?  Some of the guys they've gotten are pretty good.  And when that Wong guy comes back, he's very good.  And they picked up John Franco, which is...  I'm sorry, Al Leiter, which is what you always want down the stretch.  You know, Al Leiter.  I mean, that's really cool.  Because a lot of times, like years ago, they would just rely on some of these young Andy Pettit types,  which were just really irritating.  I grab a 40-year-old guy.  The one thing I like about Al is he will battle. 
[03:33:30]  I played with him, and he will battle.  He doesn't have much left in the tank, but he's going to go out there and battle guys.  At least they've got some guys that will go out there and take the ball.  That's great.  Your 80-year-old grandma will battle, too.  Hey, hey.  Doesn't mean she's going to win.  They're still in it.  How about all the people that said the Yankees wouldn't make the playoffs this year?  I still think they'll make the playoffs.  How shocked were you?  Because the big bet was that the Yankees were going to go for Jimmy Key.  How surprised were you that he didn't come back?  Jimmy Key?  I think I could hit off Jimmy Key.  Remember that ESPN commercial?  All right.  Todd from Virginia wants to say hi. 
[03:34:00]  Go ahead, Todd.  Yes, thanks, guys.  Rob, first of all, I enjoy your show very much, MLB Home Plate XM 175.  Yes, baseball is alive and well on Home Plate 175.  Yes, and also, thank you very, very much for throwing at that little fucko Doug DeCenzo  when he tried to bone on you a couple years ago.  Hey, that was just my deal.  Don't ever bone on me.  All right.  All right, guys.  Punch it out.  Were you slow off the mound, Rob?  No, I was like a cat.  Oh, really?  One eye and one leg. 
[03:34:30]  All right, Rob.  We'll let you be, I guess.  You've got a show to do later today, right?  Ah, sometime today.  I'm on my way to the gym.  Oh, very nice.  So, do you do the show with anyone or by yourself?  Oh, yeah.  Kevin Kennedy.  It is Kevin.  Okay.  Yeah, they do a great job, man.  I tune in from time to time.  I think you guys have a nice chemistry.  I heard Cal was doing a show.  Cal does a show once a week, but he's the face of XM Radio.  Right.  Hey, we got Kingman's stats. 
[03:35:00]  What do you got?  In 1982 on the Mets, Kingman hit 37 homers, batted 204, and struck out 156 times.  What was his on-base percentage?  That had to be under 300.  I think it was two.  So, he didn't even walk either.  I mean, he either struck out or hit a home run.  He didn't even want to walk.  Dude, he struck out trying to hit intentional walks.  He was terrible.  I was a young Mets fan back in the day, and I used to love Kingman.  I thought he was going to, like, be the next Babe Ruth. 
[03:35:30]  Little did I know.  You got some strikeouts in the on-deck circle, too, didn't you?  Yeah, pretty much.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  It's always a pleasure.  Have a great morning.  Hopefully, we'll talk to you soon.  There he goes.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Gamefly.com, of course.  Gamefly.com.  You play the baseball games, Anthony?

I didn't know if he showed it to you.  That was it.  Shut up.  What was the birthday present?  I don't know.  A knock hawk.  Oh, you were going to...  No, actually, he makes a good point.  We had to go to the phone.  You were...  I'm serious.  We'd like to smash him, but you opened something up.  I read it already.  Nobody listens.  Holy crap. 
[03:38:00]  It's a Starbucks card.  Oh, the Starbucks card.  Okay, yeah, yeah.  Happy birthday, Jim.  Is that what you were talking about?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  We had brought it up already.  No one pays attention.  Yeah, Rick.  No, I remember the Starbucks.  Look, the lovely lady in Washington, D.C. gave you a Starbucks card.  Washington State.  Oh, State.  Okay, and she's going to put some money on the card for you.  I do remember that.  I know.  I thought I knew something else.  That's the problem here.  Hawk didn't remember.  Jesus.  Too busy looking at those goddamn emails.  Just write it in mail.  You can't slide for that, smash. 
[03:38:30]  All right.  There's another big story before we get out of here.  Another teacher caught having sex with students.  God, I love these stories.  I know.  I actually want to teach.  Hot, hot, hot.  Hot, hot, hot.  Which one is this in?  Is this Sandra Beth Geisel?  Ugh.  Sex teacher?  Is this in the newspaper that says deadly joke?  Or the newspaper that says fatal joke?  Well, how about death truck?  Death truck?  Yeah, what an ass.  It's in the New York Post, Anthony.  It's on page nine. 
[03:39:00]  You were reading excerpts.  I have a failing news.  I got a fatal joke right here.  You were reading excerpts from this this morning as we were preparing for this fine radio show.  Yes.  And it was some hot, hot stuff.  Steamy, hot, and sexy.  Sex teacher scored on the gridiron.  I guess they were having sex.  You know how your high school has the football field.  And then they have that little booth up at the top of the bleachers that they announced the games from.  They had gone up in there and had some sex with a 16-year-old student in the press box. 
[03:39:30]  Sandra Beth Giselle?  Or Giesel?  How the hell do you say her name?  I went with Gizzle.  Gizz.  Gizz.  Gizz Bucket.  Yeah, had sex.  A randy teacher bedded a 16-year-old student in her home.  And then had sex with the boy at the Catholic school's football field with an earshot of his snickering pals. 
[03:40:00]  Oh, hot.  Sandra Beth Gizzbag?  The 42-year-old stunning blonde wife of a prominent Albany banker.  Oh, you got to feel bad for the husbands.  Yeah.  Unless they're really scumbags and this is the women's way of getting back.  Read more, though.  I actually got a rod from this story.  Yeah.  Oh, I know.  Also had group sex with boys.  Masturbated them in the backs of buses and gave them lovemaking tips.  Just check rules.  Masturbated them in the back.  Could you imagine just being in the back of the bus, you're 16, you're going to school, whatever, going on a trip, 
[03:40:30]  and she's back there and just sneaks your cock out of your little jeans, pulls it out, and starts giving you a handy.  How cool.  You know the banker wasn't working, right?  No.  Fatso with a dumb bow tie, and here she is banging these young teenagers.  Honey, I'm home.  Who's the kid that told?  I know.  How do you rat this out?  What is wrong with these students nowadays?  You can find the kid that told. 
[03:41:00]  He's the one just beat to a pulp on the playground.  Black eyes, bloody nose, and a foot up his ass.  She was jailed yesterday on charges of rape and endangering the welfare of an underage classmate and friend of her 17-year-old son.  Oh, so she's got a 17-year-old son that goes to the school.  She's fucking the son's friends.  Had sex with at least three 17-year-old boys, but will not be charged because those students were of age of consent. 
[03:41:30]  How about that?  What about the friend bragging over here?  You read that part?  Where's that?  The same friend, whoever this...  Maybe the one that was having sex in the press box?  Yeah.  Same friend describes one boy telling him with a big smile on his face that he just effed the teacher.  Yeah, at her house.  I just fucked the teacher.  Another boy said he had sex with her later that night.  The same night.  She was just having sex all over the place.  She got fired because she got caught banging a guy in a car in a parking lot. 
[03:42:00]  Some 17-year-old kid.  She is just a horny bitch.  She's hot, too, man.  16-year-old, one encounter.  At a friend's house, when he was present, two boys took turns having sex with her.  At least one of them switched off with her three or four times.  Jesus.  She couldn't get enough cock.  Mrs. Jizbag was talking about what he needed to do better when he's with a girl.  She was also comparing the boy to her husband.  And you know the husband wasn't winning that contest. 
[03:42:30]  No, no, no.  Wow.  Hot.  I love that.  She ain't bad, either.  Dude, she is sexy.  In the May 15th encounter, the 16-year-old boy told cops he went to a party at Jizbag's house  where a drunk Jizbag later arrived in a cab ready to rock and roll.  Nice.  Party time.  Showed up in a cab looking for some young football cock.  There's more to this story and some audio.  Cut the crap and get me a drink.  We'll play the audio of this story tomorrow, I guess, because we have run out of show, 
[03:43:00]  ladies and gentlemen.  Oh, see you.  Thanks for the birthday gift.  It's nice.  This concludes our podcast.  You'll be in the Anthony Show. </pre>
