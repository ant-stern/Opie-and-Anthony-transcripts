<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast was significantly disrupted by legal restrictions, primarily stemming from a listener contest resulting in arrests.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, spent a large portion of the show apologizing profusely ("My bad!") and filling airtime with nonsensical outbursts and profanity, repeatedly hampered by their lawyers' instructions preventing discussion of the contest.  This led to extensive use of filler, including random soundbites and tangential topics.  Jim Norton was present in the studio throughout much of the broadcast.

A significant portion focused on the disastrous stand-up performance of Billy Staples at a Jim Norton show.  The hosts played an audio recording of the performance, detailing Staples' heckling and subsequent distress, with a caller sharing their firsthand account.  This Staples' segment was revisited throughout the show, with a planned segment repeatedly delayed and snippets played across multiple sections.  Ron from the Ron and Fez show offered commentary on Staples' performance in one segment.  A scathing review of Staples' performance was also played and discussed.

The hosts' anxieties and internal conflicts were also apparent.  They discussed their "paranoia" surrounding certain situations, notably the arrest of former radio competitor Mark Parenteau on charges of sexual assault of a minor, recounting anecdotes and jokes about him.  Anthony launched into an offensive rant about children, later attempting to clarify and distance himself, leading to a satirizing bit by "Martini Steve."  Brian Regan was a guest in the studio during multiple segments, offering comedic relief and sharing his experiences with bombing on stage, particularly in contrast to Staples' panicked response.

Other topics included the ongoing baseball strike, eliciting cynical commentary from the hosts, and a discussion about a "no money excuse pool" among the hosts.   They also commented on a Tawny Stone pornography banner ad on their website and played listener-submitted "F.U." messages containing extremely offensive language.  A planned appearance by Anthony Michael Hall was cancelled due to illness.

The show also inexplicably centered around peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, with the hosts joking about the absurdity of this topic being off-limits due to perceived legal risks.  They speculated on pre-mixed peanut butter and jelly jars, creating bizarre tangents.  The “PBJ thing” was referenced frequently throughout the broadcast and even surfaced in a local news segment.

The broadcast included numerous advertisements for a wide variety of products and services, including the Ohio State Fair, Monroe Muffler, Columbus State Community College, Sprint Solutions, Kroger, Coors Original, Guitar Center, Mitsubishi Motors, SBC Ameritech, Labatt Blue, Travelocity, Jack Daniels hard cola, a gentleman's club, car dealerships, utilities, a newspaper, a malt beverage,  *Collateral Damage*, Cedar Point, *The Other Paper*, Dennis Pontiac, McDonald's, Speeds European Indoor Karting,  and DirecTV, among others.

Technical difficulties, specifically Opie's malfunctioning microphone requiring an emergency repair by Pete Johnson (who was noted to be retiring), and a past incident involving a couple having sex in the studio resulting in carpet replacement were also mentioned. Pat Croce called in to discuss his new extreme sport, "Slam Ball," providing a description and showcasing a video of the game.  A planned UK interview and other segments were cancelled at 2:40 PM due to unspecified restrictions, leading to further frustration and improvisation.  Listener calls filled part of the remaining time, with callers sharing their daily experiences.  The show concluded with a song and continued references to the unresolved situation and ongoing restrictions.

[00:06:30]  I'm somebody's bitch.  Time to be bad.  What the hell were you thinking?  There's no position.  Your balls are showing.  This is less fun than previously indicated.  I hope you grow up and your womb is barren.  Hey, what's going on here? 
[00:07:00]  Uh, brother.  We could just do this all day.  Yeah, that's one thing we can do.  We could, uh, do a show using soundbites to get our points across.  You get nothing!  You lose!  Good day, sir!  Liar!  Oh, boy.  Confess!  Liar!  Confess!  So what's new, man?  You're a liar!  You know something that you're not telling us, you slimy scumbag liar!  Yeah, thanks, Dick. 
[00:07:30]  Sweet, merciful crap!  Liar!  Tell us what you know, you goddamn liar!  How you doing?  Hey!  What's up, Anthony?  I don't know what the hell I'm going to do today.  I have no idea.  Been in too many meetings.  This calls for the old Billy Barone.  Yeah.  Oh, Lord.  Billy, Billy, Billy.  Billy, Billy.  Oh, Billy, Billy, Billy. 
[00:08:00]  This is a biggie.  Hold me down, Billy.  $30,000, Billy.  Blue, calm down, ho.  Hey, yes.  Yeah, well, we...  I swear to God, I'll pistol whip the next guy that says shenanigans.  What's new, Ant?  Uh, well, there's a couple of things in the news I guess we could talk about. 
[00:08:30]  The, uh, baseball strike.  She was a whore.  They've said it.  Just random clips.  They don't mean anything.  Seems like a lot of people are looking into things today.  We're just playing random clips, Anthony.  Dirty, dirty girl.  Stupid!  You're so stupid!  Just random clips.  They don't mean anything at all today.  All right.  Don't pay attention to your radio.  Talk about shutting the hell up! 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  Well, we've been told that, yes?  Yeah.  Yeah?  Uh, uh, let's see.  Baseball strike.  What else?  Elvis died.  Elvis.  Elvis.  He did.  Was that supposed to be sexy?  When did that happen?  We can't talk about, uh, hmm, let's see.  Uh.  We like starting the show with the top story of the day.  Yeah.  Oh, uh, Harlem Little Leaguers cleared to play.  Stupid hooker!  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good, good. 
[00:09:30]  Uh, they're in.  And they're going to, uh, be able to play in the, uh, Little League World Series.  I can tell you this much.  I slept like a baby last night.  Did you?  Yeah.  I had a good night's sleep for the first time in three days.  A little tired.  The world is a jungle.  And if you want my advice, Anthony, don't expect happiness.  You won't get it.  People let you down.  And I'm not naming any names.  But in the end, you die in your own arms.  Okay, terrific. 
[00:10:00]  Be quiet, sir.  That's what we're doing.  We're being quiet.  Yeah, we were instructed by, uh, lawyers.  Lawyers again!  Oh, wait.  Don't talk for a second.  I'm...  Someone is...  What?  What's the matter?  Yeah, write it down.  What's the problem, Rick?  Things change, uh...  Minute by minute.  Mm-hmm.  You guys are playing with fire.  We are?  Oh, no, that's not what it says.  I'm sorry.  Oh.  To...  Dick. 
[00:10:30]  What?  Ken would like us to move on.  We haven't...  From...  We haven't touched on anything.  I was just talking about, uh, the baseball strike coming up August 30th.  What a shame.  The Yankees are doing so well.  Move on.  To what?  Well, maybe we could, uh, take suggestions from, uh, the audience.  Oh, that'll work.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Look at this call.  I don't even see one call we could really put on the air.  No, we can't go to anything.  I know what I can say. 
[00:11:00]  Uh, uh, we...  We had our event yesterday.  We had our little event, our contest.  And, uh, during the course of that contest, uh, some of the contestants were arrested.  That's just a fact.  Um, and we can't talk about it because things are still up in the air.  So the lawyers have instructed us.  Let's put it this way.  The couple's still arrested.  Yeah.  And the couple, uh, uh, is still in jail.  And, and since there is, uh, still, uh, uh, legalities going on, we can't talk about anything. 
[00:11:30]  We're being gagged by the lawyers with their legal mumbo-jumbo.  Hey, we just made CNN.  Um, great.  Hey, Channel 5 in Chicago.  Oh, really?  Oh, I could do it this way. 
[00:12:00]  Um, uh, Jersey Bob.  People are, uh, asking me questions on instant feedback.  Ken is really freaking out.  We're not saying anything.  Is he?  We're not.  We're not saying anything.  We've been, we've been, we've been put in a, in a very awkward position.  Yeah.  Where, where we cannot even discuss in the slightest.  And for the first time, I will say I understand with, uh, with what they want us to do.  Oh, they're going crazy.  But it just puts us in a very awkward situation because we're, we're here to, uh, uh, do a radio show. 
[00:12:30]  And we can talk about the biggest thing that's happening with this radio show.  Right.  Uh, so we, we can't even, uh, discuss it.  Not even in the slightest.  Good.  Good.  I, I asked about, I, I asked about, uh, certain, uh, peripheral issues that, uh, maybe we could be able to talk about.  Um, some, some, some shows I was watching on TV last night at around 11 o'clock and 10 o'clock.  And, uh, certain reactions that were happening around, uh, on the news. 
[00:13:00]  And I couldn't talk about that.  They said no.  Pending litigation.  That's what they say.  That's the excuse I used.  That's the old gag I used to use.  Well, there's a lot, uh, I guess there's a lot that we'll be able to say eventually.  But, but, but, easy, Opie.  What are you saying?  Eventually, right?  What?  No.  What?  Who?  Shut up.  No.  What did you say?  So the, uh, yeah.  A huge story. 
[00:13:30]  Uh, and, and we really can't even discuss it.  I would love to.  Can we talk about how, um, let me look.  No.  I'll just say no right now.  No.  The guy with the big camera lens outside?  No.  I, I heard no.  We can't even discuss anything.  Ask Ken if we could talk about the paparazzi.  You just did.  And how they didn't recognize Aunt and I as we walked right by him.  And they looked at us and said, no, that's not them. 
[00:14:00]  They're all waiting to snap pictures.  No, okay, so we better not talk about that.  Well, that's just.  There's nothing to talk about.  No?  What do you think?  I was, I was reading about, uh, other things last night?  I'm getting, uh, head sick.  Uh, no?  No.  Okay.  No.  All right.  Thumbs down.  Thumbs down.  All right.  Well.  Move it.  Move on.  Move on.  Okay.  We're moving on.  Okay.  That's as much, that is as much as the lawyers will allow us to say about this. 
[00:14:30]  So if you're calling in reference to this, you'll knock it on the air.  Unfortunately, uh, we, we can't discuss it.  I'd love to.  I'm going to love seeing, hearing my voice on the news with the little VU meter going or  the radio dial going and saying, uh, we can't talk about it.  No comment.  No comment.  Yeah.  All right.  No comment.  Say your official thing that'll end up on the audio tracks tonight. 
[00:15:00]  Go ahead.  I don't know nothing.  Oh, that's a good one.  I don't though.  Put a real dopey picture of you up there and go, I don't know nothing.  But I don't know nothing.  We, we're out of the loop.  We really don't know anything.  Yeah.  And there's, uh, we definitely have, um, a concern for our listeners that are still being  held and, uh, it'd probably be a good idea to move on.  How's that?  Here we go.  Okay.  Ah, let me see.  Ooh, I was doing so much show prep last night. 
[00:15:30]  Hmm.  It's not like I didn't have the phone in my hand every two seconds talking to everybody.  Me and Opie haven't spoken on the phone that much in years.  No.  And then Rick and Ben, panicky Ben.  Can we, can we say, um, someone from, um, the UK contacted us?  Yes.  It was the Queen.  No?  No.  No.  Okay.  No.  Can't, uh, no. 
[00:16:00]  Huh?  So don't say it.  Don't even mention England.  Do we have any way?  Do we have the Billy Staples tape ready to go?  Oh!  Billy Staples.  That's a subject we could hit on.  Which means we're going to have to get Ron and Fez on the, on the phone.  We're still working on it.  What?  Rick.  You know what?  He was supposed to have cut it up and edited it, but Rick was in a two-hour meeting.  That cannot be discussed.  Exactly.  Rick was in a two-hour meeting.  Was it about my September 7th gig in Long Island?  You're, you're the worst.  You're the worst. 
[00:16:30]  Really, Rick?  Yeah.  Hold that up again.  So, Opie, there you go.  At least you have something to fall back on, my friend.  Opie, look.  You are the worst.  This is it for me.  That means it's got to be true.  It's got to be true.  That's got to be true.  It's got to be true.  What are we talking about?  Look.  Just look at the letters.  A.P.?  No, don't say it.  What does that mean, no?  It means it's got to be true.  What's got to be true?  I don't know.  Stop it.  What?  You're putting me in a weird position.  Me?  This one was your idea. 
[00:17:00]  Not as weird as the...  What?  Who?  I didn't say anything.  This was your idea.  What was?  What was?  What was my idea?  It was...  Nothing was my idea.  I'm not the idea guy.  I'm not.  I'm not the idea guy.  I'm just saying it was your idea to do a show today.  Hey, Jim Norton, how about some yucks?  Jesus.  If we ever needed a Jim Norton in the studio today... 
[00:17:30]  You're right.  I really am contributing nothing.  I just don't want to say the wrong thing.  Right.  Because let's face it, you're the pansy of the group.  Look, I'm the first one to go.  If there's a real problem and they want to set an example,  you don't set it with Oprah Ant.  You set it with the little blubbery-breasted friend.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  I will definitely be the we're not kidding around example.  Why don't we get the Billy Staples tape together?  Because that is some really good radio.  I listened to Billy on...  Is it almost done?  Who's working on it?  We're working on it.  We just got to clean up. 
[00:18:00]  There's a lot of cursing and we still got to clean up.  Rick, we need it.  Oh, he was cursing his ass off.  We need it in like 15 minutes because we can't do this for like another hour.  I was listening to Ron Efez.  They come on in New York after our show.  Why don't we set up the whole Billy Staples thing again?  Well, Billy Staples used to be on our show.  He used to be like one of the, I don't know, cast of characters,  a little rotating cast of characters that come and go during the years.  And he was one of them.  He worked with another guy, Paul Bond.  They were air-sick productions, if you remember. 
[00:18:30]  He used to write some song parodies.  And occasionally we'd play one.  And then something...  Yeah, it just kind of...  Times changed.  Things changed.  And he moved on.  And he moved on to the Ron Efez show.  Come on after us.  And he changed from Fat Guy, which we used to call him,  to Billy Staples because he got that stomach stapling surgery.  And he slimmed down a little bit.  Yeah.  Then he plumped up a little bit.  And he's having trouble with his weight again.  But in nowhere near where it was, he couldn't even walk. 
[00:19:00]  His knees would buckle when he walked.  So he thought it would be a good idea to go on stage at one of Norton's shows recently at Red Bank.  Yeah.  Red Bank.  A couple weeks ago.  Rich Voss, he asked you...  He was hosting to, you know...  But not in a groveling way.  We were talking because we were going on vacation.  We were away.  And Ron and Fez were great.  Were helping me out.  And they were mentioning the show.  And Billy's like, hey, I'll do it with you.  Kind of kidding around.  I'm like, you know what, dude? 
[00:19:30]  Yeah, do it with me.  Why not?  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  It's like, he's a buddy of mine, so put him on.  Do the show.  And, you know, he did.  So he decided he wanted to do this.  Rich Voss was going to open up the show.  And then bring on Billy, and then a little more Rich Voss, and then Norton comes out and destroys the crowd.  Well, the people were killing Billy before he even hit the stage.  I just heard about it. 
[00:20:00]  I heard it was brutal.  Just a brutal attack on Billy.  Everything from the clothes he was wearing.  I hear he had a big orange shirt on.  And people in the front just kept calling him, shut up, you big effing pumpkin.  They were calling him a big effing pumpkin.  And just heckling to the point where he could not get one line out.  He never got to do his act.  Whether it was funny or not.  Right.  He couldn't do anything.  Right.  He leaves the stage.  Tells everybody to go eff themselves and just leaves the stage. 
[00:20:30]  Rich Voss comes back on to an ovation I've never heard for Voss.  They love just having anybody else on stage.  And talks Billy into coming back on stage.  He goes, try two more.  Two more.  So Billy comes back out.  And now the crowd, even worse.  He tries again to get into the flow of an act.  And they just, they leveled him.  So now he's been MIA ever since that night.  He has not shown up for work on Ron and Fez's show. 
[00:21:00]  And last night they finally got in touch with him.  He's, he's shacked up somewhere in PA.  He's in Pennsylvania hanging out.  He says he cannot face the people in the station.  He feels he cannot walk down the hallways because he feels so degraded.  He also is, it sounded like he's on the verge of suicide.  He said his life has been falling apart.  He lost everything.  He now has to live back with his mother. 
[00:21:30]  And he's really going through tough times.  And the one thing he had, the one thing that kept him going,  was the dream of being a popular stand-up comic.  And he had been doing stand-up for nine years.  And he said when you're booed off a stage like that, it just crushes you.  Especially when that is all you have to live for.  Isn't he in Pennsylvania somewhere too?  Yeah, that's where he shacked up.  Is that even in the area?  No.  Yeah.  He just left the area.  Because, and you know why he left? 
[00:22:00]  He wanted to drive out of the range of the station.  He did not want to be in the range where any radio might be on where he passes by  and hears people talking about how the people destroyed him.  He's being way too hard on himself because the listeners decided to not give him a chance.  They busted his balls.  It wasn't even about his jokes or his act.  He never even had a chance officially.  And it was set up that way by, well, mostly Ron and Fez, I would think. 
[00:22:30]  He was a ball-busting.  And their listeners, they were ball-busting him pretty bad and stuff.  And they pretty much told everybody, and I guess we did as well to a certain extent,  to go there and just kill him.  Just kill him.  You want me to read the review of the Staples show that is on redbank.com?  Sure.  This is brutal.  It's Showtime at the Count Basie.  It's what they called it.  It was at the Count Basie Theater.  Watching Billy Staples' set at the Count Basie Theater fell somewhere between witnessing a seal clubbing 
[00:23:00]  and watching Robert De Niro play Russian roulette in a Vietnam prison camp.  Billy Staples, a stand-up comedian and regular on the Ron and Fez show,  performed in front of the sold-out crowd at the recent Jim Norton show on August 10th.  Well, I shouldn't really say performed.  It was more like he was ripped to shreds by the ravenous hordes of fans that made up the audience.  The show, which was hosted by stand-up comic Rich Voss,  was to feature a small set by Billy Staples.  I think the whole ordeal lasted about five minutes,  though I'm sure it felt like two or three days of prison time for Billy. 
[00:23:30]  Prison shower time.  Believe it or not, 30 seconds into the routine,  people were actually asking for Voss back,  despite the fact that Voss is usually referred to as being as funny as cancer.  It's all a big joke.  The man's a great comic.  Even with all the heckling he had to deal with, he pulled it off.  If only Billy could have been so lucky.  Even before the giant orange shirt-wearing Billy Staples put his first foot on the stage,  the cries of,  You suck!  Go home and kill yourself! 
[00:24:00]  Hit the poor sap like a bag of hate!  There really wasn't anything he could do to help things.  The truth, the crowd would have hurled insults at sick children.  There were, however, some things he could do to make it worse,  and that's where Billy shined brightest.  Now, I'm no stand-up comic,  but I'll be willing to beat...  Bet.  To bet, sorry.  When we get down to the middle of this,  it got all fuzzy on my monitor. 
[00:24:30]  I need a new monitor in here.  That any joke that starts out with,  Anyone ever have a colonoscopy  is not going to go over too well with a bunch of drunken 20-year-olds.  And when the punchline is,  It's a real pain in the ass,  you might as well throw a bag of ground beef in your pants  and spend the afternoon at Louie Anderson's place.  Oh, God.  Sure enough, that's the direction Billy went.  Even asking hecklers to repeat their insults.  I think there was even a Fabio joke in there.  Bad move, poor fella. 
[00:25:00]  He would do that.  He would be standing there,  and from what I heard,  people would be yelling,  You suck and insults,  and then he'd go,  What?  What?  Yeah, what'd you say?  What'd you say?  And give the heckler a chance to say it again.  And louder.  And then, of course,  the headliner for the evening did not disappoint.  Jim Norton was great.  And then he talked about how people were yelling out stuff during your set.  But you're kind of used to that.  Well, they yell out show stuff.  Like tussle.  Yeah, yeah.  That's not hateful.  They yell out tussle.  Tussle my hair, Norton. 
[00:25:30]  Yeah, they just yell out,  You stink and I don't like you.  It's cool.  Yeah.  But they're not giving me a hard time.  They're just having fun.  They really gave Billy a hard time,  and there wasn't much he could do, man.  It threw him off.  You could see it threw him off.  I didn't feel bad for him,  because I'm a comic.  I've been through that.  It's like it happens.  And the odds were against him,  and it's funny.  It's like, come on, man.  You took it on the chin.  You took it like a trooper.  Yeah, he's taking it way too hard.  No, it wasn't about his act.  Who cares?  It wasn't about that.  Let me just finish off this thing real quick.  It says Norton put on a great show.  It was just about the best part of the night. 
[00:26:00]  The best part, that is,  Tata Laverne and Shirley from Opie and Anthony fame,  danced at the Walt Street pub  that pulls on the old American heartstrings  both of these messes in their busted glory,  slopping down glasses of Budweiser  and trying to forget.  If only Billy could.  News at 11.  Well, we got the tape, Anthony.  Yeah. 
[00:26:30]  We finally got the tape from Red Bank.  I have not heard it.  It is brutal.  I think the audio of the crowd,  unfortunately, doesn't really come up.  You could kind of hear it,  especially when they were really yelling.  You know how much they charged  to tape that whole show?  Because I needed it set for other purposes.  Yeah.  And I heard that the audio on the crowd  isn't that great.  I'm furious.  You could barely hear that.  You could barely hear the audio of the crowd.  Which is good.  When you're making the tape,  who needs the audience mic?  You know, you might as well just have me  talking to the audience mic.  Billy Staples, he's crystal clear  and you definitely get a feel  for what the F is going on 
[00:27:00]  between him and the audience.  You absolutely know  because he cannot get a word out.  He tries to get into something,  tries to get into one of his bits  or a joke or something  and the people are just non-stop  and he's stuttering.  He's stopping.  He's going,  come on guys, seriously, seriously.  He says seriously so many times.  Which means please, please shut up  so I can say this.  You never let them win.  Even if you bomb,  you cannot control  if they're going to yell at you  or scream. 
[00:27:30]  You can't make them not  but you just got to get F you  and mean it.  You really got to be ready.  I'm going to bomb  and I'm going to go down  having a good time  and swinging  and I think he wanted to do well  and it's like,  dude, it's alright  if you don't do well.  You do what you do  and if they don't do well,  so what?  It was a huge gig for the guy.  Dude, I'll put him on  he comes out all like light  on his feet,  kind of bouncing out like,  hey everybody!  He was ready to go  in his well-pressed orange shirt.  Yeah.  Anybody have a colonoscopy? 
[00:28:00]  Huh?  And they started just pounding him.  Then he goes,  oh, I'm the only one.  And I'll tell you one thing though,  a bombing like that,  believe it or not,  whether he understands this or not,  taking it like that  where they're yelling and screaming  before you hit the mic  is better  than having a set  where it's like  they just stare at you  and it's like,  oh man,  they really are ready to laugh  and I stink.  That's worse.  Oh, oh, yeah.  This is like one you write off  and you go,  dude, they were busting my balls,  that's all it was.  Yeah, let's go to the phones.  Barbara wants in.  Hey, Barbara, what's up?  Hi.  Hi.  I was at the show in Red Bank. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah, okay.  And I kind of felt bad for him  because no one really gave him  a chance to talk  and we were sitting there  trying to listen  and the poor guy  never really got a chance  to even get a joke out.  He never had a chance.  Yeah.  That's why he shouldn't feel bad  about himself.  Well, yeah, that's true  but, I mean,  in a way I felt like  Rich Vance was able  to at least get the audience  back on his side  after a while  whereas Billy Staples  just didn't even know  what to say.  But, boss,  you have to realize  Billy's been doing radio  for a while  so he hasn't been up as much  because of the hours.  He's only getting on  like once a week 
[00:29:00]  so he's probably a little bit  like just needs  a little bit more  stage time  just to get back  to where he would have been.  You understand what I mean?  Yeah, but you know  every night getting yelled at.  You know something, though?  The way he sounded  on Runner Fez last night  I wanted Don Corleone  to slap him in the face.  He just sounded like  you know,  I had this dream  it was this  it was  what am I going to do?  How am I going to get back  on stage again?  Come on.  Just get on.  Buck up, little camper.  Get on. 
[00:29:30]  If they were  a great crowd  but they were  just busting your balls, dude.  It isn't like  they were so ready for you  and like,  alright, let's give them a chance  and then you just bombed.  They did it on purpose.  I think they were showing  some O&A love.  Dude, they emailed me with that  like, you know,  we really felt bad for Billy  we gave him a hard time  I got like 50 emails  saying we felt bad for Billy  Well, we gotta play the audio  and it will prove  that Billy Staples  never had a chance.  He didn't.  It really wasn't about his act.  Dude, sometimes  I did a gig  which is done now  for the Cleveland Browns  and I had a decent set  I did it  and my first joke 
[00:30:00]  got a zero  and I mean  nothing.  The whole team  stared at me  and I'm like  I am really  on a bomb.  The next couple of jokes  started to work.  Had they been yelling  and screaming  I would have just  went down in flames.  You know what I mean?  It happens.  They were a good crowd  they were mellow  so I was able to recover  and I still didn't even kill  it was just good.  Well, the way they were  talking last night  to Billy  they just kept  and they kept saying  well, you know 
[00:30:30]  it was Norton's crowd  it's Norton's show  and I just  it was almost like  they were rubbing it in  it was almost like  they were rubbing it  into Billy  like, see Billy  when you get in front  of an entire theater  of people  that are there  to see one guy  oh, it was just brutal.  But that's not  but no, man  Yeah, but they were just  turning the screws  last night  to make for good radio  and I hope he didn't  take it personally.  He did.  He took it so personally.  What do you expect?  Ron and Fez to  do a whole hour  with everyone calling up 
[00:31:00]  comforting the guy?  It's hard though, man.  Some people were.  Oh, they were a little bit?  Some people were comforting him.  I was getting sick.  Dude, you gotta give him  a break.  He's had a tough time.  It does suck though  and it seems like  everything's piling up.  I'm not saying  it wasn't tough  or anything  but the way he came off  sounding on the air  last night  was really just kind of  I just wish I could have  talked to him  for a few minutes  because I heard  he left me an apology  to somebody  like Tom Norton.  I'm sorry.  Like, for what?  Not your fault, dude.  Relax.  Alright, well, why don't  we take a break?  The audio's just about done.  You gotta hear it for yourself.  Yeah.  And we'll definitely 
[00:31:30]  give it to Ron and Fez  so they can have it  for tonight's show  here in New York as well, okay?  Right.  As we attempt to move on, Anthony.  Attempting.  Moving on.  Working on it.

[00:41:00]  We're shutting up.  It's best that we  shut up for now.  They're all pink  on the inside.  Hey!  Although  all the other radio shows  talking about us.  Oops.  Oops.  And wha!  A couple phone numbers  in the New York City area.  877-692-1027  outside of New York.  866-277.  Poor wow.  I was screaming  in the office, too. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, my God.  Why?  Well,  stuff I can't talk about.  But I was screaming.  Like,  I was just,  ugh.  Ugh.  One day.  One day,  we'll be able to discuss.  A lot of people  assuming a lot.  Yeah.  So,  baseball looks like,  what,  they're striking  August 30th?  Yeah.  Know why they could strike?  Good news for the Mets.  Know why they could  continue to strike?  Why?  Every few years.  Because we always come back. 
[00:42:00]  Yep.  That's why.  That's the only reason  why they're striking again.  They don't give a flying F  about the fans  because they know  that we'll be back.  Of course.  They got people  that figure out  how much money  they're going to lose  in the short term  and they figure out,  you know,  is it worth to lose  this much money  in the short term  knowing that eventually  we will be back.  Of course.  They don't care.  All these stupid news stations  could interview  all the fans they want 
[00:42:30]  and the fans could say,  you know,  well,  maybe this time  I'm not coming back.  You know what?  Major League Baseball  doesn't care.  They don't care  about your interviews.  They don't care  you're interviewing the fans  because they know  the fans will be back  and that's the only reason  they're able  to strike again.  Right.  End of story.  End of story.  You know how I kind of  talk about how I'm a Met fan?  The fact of the matter is  I couldn't even name  the starting lineup  of the Mets.  I couldn't tell you.  Know why? 
[00:43:00]  Because I'm not  as interested in baseball  like I used to be.  Right.  Okay?  Well, besides,  the Mets are having  a horrible year  and they have a really  bad losing streak.  So maybe it's good  that they're striking.  But that's why  they're striking.  You don't think  they got people  to figure it all out?  You know?  What are the odds?  The fans are going  to come back?  How long is it going  to take?  People, like I said,  people will come back.  If your team  is doing well,  if the team  that you like  to go see  is doing well, 
[00:43:30]  the stadium  will be packed  regardless of if  they just came back  from a strike  and everyone's pissed off  because for every person  that isn't going  to show up,  there's somebody  behind them  that's going  to buy the ticket  and get in there  that wants to see  a team that's doing well.  If a team's doing crappy  and they don't really  have a fan base,  they won't be there.  They won't be watching  whether there's a strike  or not.  I don't even understand.  And I consider myself  kind of savvy  as far as the news goes.  I like to be informed. 
[00:44:00]  And I have no clue  what this strike is about.  None.  A bunch of scumbag millionaires.  Cops and firemen  can't get a raise,  but they said A-Rod  will be losing  $114,000 a day  if they strike.  That's the kind of money  they're dealing with.  They're a bunch of babies.  All of them.  Yeah.  I don't care if they have a cap  or if they don't have a cap.  Prices are never going down  when you go to the stadium.  Ever.  If they don't have a cap,  you're still going to get raped.  If they do,  you're going to get raped.  I understand.  Obviously,  it's about money.  But I have no clue 
[00:44:30]  why it's about money,  whose money,  who's paying,  who's not paying,  who wants more,  who wants...  Is it between owners?  Is it between the players and owners?  The players are bitching.  Oh, if you have a thing,  if you have any type of cap,  we're going to lose money,  or if you have a luxury tax,  we're going to lose money.  And if the owners say  we're not going to pay more  than, say, $30,000,  and that collusion,  you can't win.  What the hell is the luxury tax?  It's a bunch of dumb,  small market teams  that aren't winning,  sniveling.  It's like a welfare system  for baseball.  They're all bellyaching 
[00:45:00]  about all the Yankees  and the big market teams.  I understand.  They want teams like the Yankees  that spend a lot of money  on their players  to not be able  to spend that much money.  So how would they use  this luxury tax  to restrict how much money  the Yankees spend?  I don't know specifics.  See, that's what I mean.  I don't even understand.  I hear luxury tax,  and I go, what?  Isn't that a spot on Monopoly?  And then I land on  every goddamn time  I go around the board.  Every time I land  on luxury tax.  You pay.  If you spend over the cap, 
[00:45:30]  you pay a certain tax.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Shut up, shut up.  Shut up!  Okay.  If you spend over the cap,  you pay a tax,  and that goes,  I believe,  into the smaller market teams.  Oh, oh, oh.  So if you then  want to buy some key players,  you spend money  over your cap,  you get taxed,  and that tax goes  into a kitty  for the crappy  small market team  that then can afford  better players  because you just bought.  That is ridiculous. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, it's communism,  and the Baltimore Orioles,  look at what their payroll is,  and they stink.  It doesn't matter.  I mean,  it does help to have money,  but I'm so tired  of small market.  Hey, man,  we're a small market, really?  Then get out of baseball.  Montreal,  it's considered a small market.  They don't support baseball.  They don't like it.  The team is doing well,  and they still don't,  I don't think,  sell out every night.  Get rid of it in Montreal.  George, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  You know,  I think they're different  than in 94.  In 94, you know, 
[00:46:30]  you had people coming back.  Now,  after September 11,  these are just like  million-dollar babies  that are flying.  You know what?  All it's going to take  is another Mark McGuire thing  or Barry Bonds  going for 75 homers.  You guys,  and I'm in there, too,  because I'm sure  I'll be going back  to the park  because I get tickets  here and there.  We're going back.  I don't know about that.  And Major League Baseball  would not be setting  another strike date  if they didn't think  they could get away  with it again.  And, dude,  the owners are the worst. 
[00:47:00]  Because it comes down  to money,  and eventually,  if they think,  you know,  this time we're screwed,  you know,  the whole league is F  because the fans  aren't coming back,  you know what?  They would try  to work it out  because it's all about  the bottom dollar,  and I'm telling you,  they just know  that the fans  are coming back eventually.  Who is it that owns  the White Sox?  Jerry something?  I can't remember his name.  Reinsdorf.  Right, it is Reinsdorf.  I think he was one  of the biggest complainers  about the salaries,  and then when they came back  from the strike,  he gave Frank Thomas,  wasn't it 50 million,  or was it Albert Bell? 
[00:47:30]  It was some monster contract  this jackass handed out.  You don't want to pay it?  Don't pay it.  Don't worry about  what the Yankees are doing.  Mind your business  and don't spend  what you don't want to spend,  creeps.  At what point  do your earnings  stop you from having  a union, though?  I mean,  these guys,  minimum pay is $250,000.  You don't need a union  at that point.  No, no.  The union,  yeah, exactly.  So who's to blame?  Who's the bad guy here?  Who's the bad guy here?  I've got to say the players.  The players are the bad guys  because they...  If you own a business,  if you own a business, 
[00:48:00]  you can hire  who you want to hire  and pay them what you want.  If you're building  some good next date,  you're up.  Right.  Why?  Here's the problem,  and I know I've played  devil's advocate.  For many, many, many years,  the owners had that type  of control,  and when you look at  the way they paid  the players back then,  I mean,  they certainly were  not fair with them.  So it's like you can't  give the owners too much  and the players  are as greedy as they.  Everyone's greedy.  It's all of them.  They're all greedy.  You know what you've  got to understand, too?  When they pay a player  like A-Rod  that many millions  of dollars, 
[00:48:30]  it's almost like  you're putting it  into advertising.  You're getting the player,  but you're also getting  the player that is worth  this many millions  of dollars.  So now,  it kind of makes it  like you want  to go see him.  I've got to go see  the guy that's worth  $250 million.  And they stink,  the Rangers.  They stink.  Get pitching,  you idiot.  It's all pitching.  You're not just  paying for the player.  You're not just  paying for the player  and his talents.  The more you pay,  the more people  want to go and see  that highly paid player, 
[00:49:00]  the star,  and then they go  and buy seats  in the stadium.  It's almost like  it's part advertising.  It's all pitching.  And the fact they  spend that kind of money  on a hitter,  they don't deserve to  and that's poor management.  Why do you think  Boston is at least  around every year?  Because of the money  they give Pedro.  Maybe they don't win  the series,  but they're good  every year.  They're in contention.  Look what Arizona did  with stupid Randy Johnson  and Kobe gets a chance  at Curt Schilling.  It's all pitching.  What's wrong with Curt Schilling?  I hate him.  The Yankees could never 
[00:49:30]  beat him.  Ever.  He's an old friend of mine.  Is he really?  I hate him.  He plays EverQuest,  too, you know.  He kills the Yankees.  He's very heavily  into the computer game  EverQuest.  And the cancer thing,  his wife has it.  Skin cancer.  Well, it didn't seem  to stop him from  pitching well  against the Yankees,  that bastard.  They have never  been able to be chilling.  The skin cancer  affects his family  so badly  that he doesn't even  allow his kids  to play during the day.  Outside.  Really?  Yeah.  Look at you.  You're a wealth  of information.  He's an old pal, 
[00:50:00]  so I keep up  on Curt Schilling.  One of your old  drinking buddies  from where?  I was part of  one of the  Sports Illustrated  articles on Curt Schilling.  There was a story  about Curt Schilling  having a bad outing,  I think,  with Roger Clemens  when they were  both in minor league  ball or something  or maybe they were  playing.  I don't know.  And they asked Curt  about his performance  and he said,  well, the night before  I was out with  a bunch of radio guys.  I swear to God.  Oh.  I was one of those  radio guys. 
[00:50:30]  Well, your old pal  kills the Yankees  and I don't like him  more.  Even when he was  with Philly,  they'd play interleague.  They could never be  chilling.  It's all pitching.  All pitching.  All right.  How the Yankees  win every year.  They have Rivera.  They have Pettit.  El Duque.  But all this talk  about the fans  not coming back,  that's pretty silly.  I think people  would be more  disgusted this time.  I really do.  It would take a lot  longer.  What about 94?  People were outraged.  They stayed away  for a little while  but within what?  A little over a season  it was back to normal. 
[00:51:00]  I believe it  the 11th people  looked at things  a little bit differently.  More has been  put into perspective  and I think that effect  will take place  for a while.  People are like,  ugh, that's what  you're complaining about?  You babies?  Yeah, I know.  I hope so  but I'm not holding  out hope on that.  No way.  We're going to go  on strike.  Every eight years  these jizz bags  can't work out  their million dollar  money problems.  All of them.  They are just  and they keep  putting in new teams  and diluting  the pitching  in the market  because the owners 
[00:51:30]  get like millions  every time  there's a new team  and the new teams  blow and the cities  don't want them  so they switch cities.  They all suck.  So aggravating.  If your fans  don't support it  get out of the city.  That's it.  Alright, why don't  we break again?  Look at that.  We did a little break  on the baseball strike.  It was kind of  intelligent too.  Good, good.  Sorry, Doug.  No, can't.  Frank, yes,  I realize  no, can't.  Well, sorry 
[00:52:00]  it sounds like  you're listening  to the fan.  Yeah, they're getting  very angry  but we told you  at the top of the show  we can't talk about  things right now.  Yesterday.  We got a couple  of our listeners  still in jail  and it's best  that we all  just shut up  right now.  Anyway.  How much was  I'll get off topic.  How much was  that thunder  and lightning  today freaking  you out  right by the building?  It was only  raining over 
[00:52:30]  the building  for a while.  Hilarious.  There was a bolt  of lightning  that I swear  was going to  strike Opie  as he sat  in his chair  and the loudest  clap of thunder.  Ken Stevens  when we were  taking one of  many calls  with him.  Yeah, a lot  of calls today.  He jumped  when he heard  that lightning  but at one point  it was very strange  it was only  raining over  this building  and really hard.  A little creepy.  I do believe  they call that  a nest storm.  A little creepy. 
[00:53:00]  Hey, wheelchair  Fred, we can  talk to him.  Oh, there we go.  See how his  Pat Benatar  show went.  I'm so pissed  off today too  because without  saying stuff.  Yeah.  Oh my God.  So much stuff  to talk about.  You talk about  not having to  prepare for a radio  show.  So much stuff  to talk about.  Little ins and  outs and things  and nothing.  Nothing.  We've been allowed  nothing.  I was asking  questions about  what I could 
[00:53:30]  talk about  and I just  heard over the  speakerphone.  No.  No.  No.  Don't even think  it.  No.  No.  Can I say  this much?  No.  What?  Well, they're  dumping it out  down the hall.  Yeah.  Ken K.  Stevens on the  dump button  today.  The big boss  on the dump  button himself  making sure  I'm dumping  that one. 
[00:54:00]  Don't.  Don't.  Are you  insane?  Don't.  Stop.  You idiot.  That was  funny.  It's all  timing guys.  If I can't  say this then  I can't say  this.  It's not  really about  it too much  really.  Yeah.  Ben had me  so freaked  out last  night.  I almost  went in  your pants.  I almost  decided to  visit another 
[00:54:30]  state in the  middle of the  night.  Buffalo?  It's not  the French  Revolution.  You don't  have to leave.  What's the  matter with  you?  The French  Revolution.  You were  going to  pack a bag  and go on  the lam  and sneak  out under  the dark  of night.  But Ant  understands.  Ant is  pretty freaked.  Pete Panic  over there?  You cannot  go to  Ben.  And I'm  not talking  about it.  I'm talking  about any  crisis situation.  Anything  that comes  up that  deserves  attention.  Let me  tell you this 
[00:55:00]  much.  Ben will  call you and  freak you out.  Let me  start by  saying this.  When this  show goes  to the  mattresses,  we're the  worst.  We all  stink.  We all  get each  other really  paranoid.  Clemenza knows  how to handle  the mattresses.  He just  goes,  eh, you  know, we  got to go  through this  thing every  eight years  or so.  Gets rid  of the  bad blood.  I'm calling  Ope  last night.  I called  you, of  course, there  was no  answer.  I'm calling  him.  I made the  terrible error  of calling 
[00:55:30]  Ben after  power drinking  for 13  hours.  Dude, dude,  I got to  touch.  Dude, dude,  I'm hearing  nothing but  awful, horrible,  impending news  that is just  panic.  Pete panic.  National  Guard.  All herky  jerking around  with bad  information.  Uh-oh, we're  getting a  wrap it up.  Really?  We're getting  a move on  signal.  Oh, yeah,  move on.  Just talking  about Ben 
[00:56:00]  and how  dramatic he  is.  Jeremy sure  is svelte.  All right,  we'll keep  driving down  the highway  and we'll  take the  next exit  and see  what's  there.

The other day I'm  waiting for this bus  and some woman next  to me says,  nice day, and I 
[00:59:30]  say, looks like  rain.  Then at work my  boss mentions that  hey, there might be  bonuses this year  after all, and I'm  like, hey, when did  you know we're  freeze-over?  See the pattern?  But then I heard  that not only do  Sprint Solutions have  local calling and  great features, it  also has long  distance for six  cents a minute no  matter where I call,  no matter what  time I call.  Guess what?  They're not kidding.  You actually get the  phone features and  services you use most  and you get long  distance for six  cents, and then  that is it.  So there's me  standing there with  my new Sprint  Solutions thinking,  I'm still going to  be a bit of a cynic 
[01:00:00]  after this, right?

We've always known  that the Kroger  Plus card is  different because it  does more and  saves you more, but  we never realized that  to some customers, it's 
[01:00:30]  a different kind of  card entirely.  To me, the Plus  card is a greeting  card, because when I  carry it, I can say  hello to savings in  every aisle.  It's a Trump card,  because it always  trumps the regular  price.  It's a flash card,  because the shelf  tags tell me in a  flash how much cash  I'm saving.  It's a get well card,  because I've had a  healthier food budget  ever since I started  using it.  Whatever your Plus  card means to you,  be sure to use it  all this week to  save on 12 packs of  Pepsi at $1.99.  Limit 8.  Kroger half-gallon  milk or orange juice 
[01:01:00]  at $6 for $6.  Limit 6.  3 or 5-pound packages  of Kroger flavor  seal ground chuck at  buy one, get one  free.  And 3-pound packages  of my choice fresh  boneless skinless  chicken breast at $1.77  a pound.  To me, the Kroger  Plus card is a cute  card, because I can't  remember why.  Oh, man.  Oh, here it comes.  This cue stick is  bent.  Oh, man. 
[01:01:30]  What?  Again?  Well, Murphy just won  the excuse pool.  The what?  The eight-ball excuse pool.  We bet on what excuse  you'll use when you  miss.  You see, I had this  table's not level.  Jimmy D had too much  English.  I had.  Who loved me?  And Murphy won it  with Ben's cue stick.  He'll owe me a  course original.  Hey, how do I owe you  a course?  You have to pay for  the winner's beer all  night.  No, see, that's not a  pool.  In a pool, we would  all agree to it ahead  of time.  Oh, for all of you.  Yeah, just buy the  man his beer.  No way.  Besides, I couldn't 
[01:02:00]  even if I wanted to.  The bank machine was  out of cash.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  We have a winner.  Don't even.  Yep.  The no money excuse  pool.  Nothing says guys  not out like Coors  original.  Real golden beer.  The official sponsor  of pool tables, lame  excuses, and everything  else.  Guys not out.  Hey, why is the  waitress so bummed?

[01:03:30]  You want to keep lying?  Telling my parents?  Grandparents?  Everyone?  That tobacco's okay?  You've got to come  through me.  You want to sell a  product that kills  1,200 people every  day?  First, you've got to  come through me.  And me.  And me.  And me.  I may be young, but  all that means is I can  run circles around you.  You say tobacco's just  a business?  I say I can't be  bought.  You say you're not  forcing anyone to  smoke?  I'll show you my dad 
[01:04:00]  who's tried to quit for  30 years and can't  because you put crap  in a cigarette that  makes it almost  impossible to quit.  Even for the strongest  man I know.  You want to keep  selling cigarettes  in a pack of lies.  First, you've got to  come through me.  And me.  And me.  And me.  And I'm not going  to make it easy.  Stand up.  Speak out against  tobacco.  Standonline.org.  Yeah, last month  when Mitsubishi Motors  started offering its  never-pay-interest deal  where you can buy a  brand-new 2002 
[01:04:30]  Mitsubishi and  never-pay-interest  and make no payments  for a year,  a lot of other  nevers happen, too.  First off, we never  thought never-paying  interest would be so  popular.  We also never thought  we'd sell so many  cars in a single month.  But mostly, we never  thought we'd get close  to selling all our  award-winning 2002  Mitsubishis.  The Eclipse, the  Montero Sport, the  Lancer, even the  Gallant, the fastest  growing Japanese  sedan in its class.  But they're going  fast.  And when they're gone,  so is the deal, which  let's face it, you'd  never like to hear.  So if you want to buy  a brand-new 2002  Mitsubishi and you  want to never-pay 
[01:05:00]  interest and make no  payments for a year,  you may never get a  chance like this again.  So hurry, because  won't last forever!  Head to Mitsubishi  Motors right now and  never pay interest for  the length of your  loan and pay nothing  for a year on a  brand-new 2002  Mitsubishi.  Hurry, when they're  gone, so is the deal.  Important program and  credit restrictions apply.  Apply to new 2002  models and new 2003  Eclipse.  Go phone and  exclude 2003  Eclipse spiders.  Some customers may  not qualify.

[01:05:30]  things his way.  My girlfriend put the  cumin in the K section,  not the C.  It was chaos.  A perfect candidate  for one of SBC's  personalized phone plans.

[01:06:30]  Circleville, Columbus.  107-1.  The Big Wasu.  It's Friday!  Friday!  Friday!  We're back with the O.P. and  Anthony show.  You know, I didn't have  any rum in the house  last night.  I didn't take any of that.  What was that rum?  That Malibu? 
[01:07:00]  That Barry Williams,  Greg Brady  brought in the other day?  And I didn't take it  home with me.  I left the office.  I needed a drink  so bad,  I drank  Grey Goose Vodka  and Coke.  You ever have a  vodka and Coke?  It's awful.  The Grey Goose was that...  Grey Goose Vodka  is great,  but not with Coke.  I know I never  drink vodka and Coke,  but it had that  orange flavor to it.  It was an orange  flavored Grey Goose  vodka  and Coke.  Wasn't bad. 
[01:07:30]  Took the edge off,  I'll tell you that much.  My hands were like  I was shucking clams  all day.  They just had that  goopy feel to them  of impending doom.  Great.  Lots going on today.  Lots of  stuff we can't talk  about right now.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm going to kill Rick.  We really need...  We're dying over here.  I just needed  juice. 
[01:08:00]  I'm drinking my...  He's getting the  Billy Staples audio  together.  When Billy Staples  opened for Norton  about two weeks ago now.  Yeah.  Bombed horribly,  but I'm telling you  it wasn't really his fault.  The crowd never gave him  a chance.  We finally got the audio.  We want to play it  for everybody today.  So we got that  going for us,  which is nice.  All I kept thinking  too was  at least I'm not  Mark Parenteau.  At least I'm not  Mark Parenteau. 
[01:08:30]  Thank God almighty,  at least I'm not  Mark Parenteau.  One of our old  competitors from  Boston and New York.  Yeah, he was  arrested.  Last heard on  Q104 and  last heard on  WAAF.  Yeah.  Dave Dickless  actually brought him  back.  That is a fact.  In Boston.  And he was  arrested.  When did that  happen?  Yesterday?  Yes.  Wow. 
[01:09:00]  But oh my God,  the charges.  Jiminy Cricket.  Sexual assault  of a 14-year-old  homeless boy.  And he's probably  like,  Oh, I finally  made the paper.  Hey, hey.  Hey, see, I'm in  the news.  Yeah, boss.  Hey, wait, what?  Did you notice the  story above you,  Mark, once again?  Yeah, wait, what?  Ouch.  Once again, we  trumped you.  Oh, we, pal.  We, uh, boy, we  used to butt heads 
[01:09:30]  with him when we  were up in Boston.  And, uh, we  had a segment we  called, um, tell  us your Mark  Parenteau  experiences.  Remember the guy  that was delivering  the packages and  said, uh, he  worked for like  FedEx or UPS or  something?  These are all  alleged stories.  Allegedly, but, uh,  I would assume  accurate.  Who knew we'd be  right six years  later?  Yeah, I know.  The one guy, the 
[01:10:00]  one I remember the  most is the guy  delivering the  package and saying  that when, uh, uh,  the door opened,  it was Mark's, uh,  I guess his live-in,  someone that shared,  uh, the house with  him, his live-in  blonde boy with  the robe on?  Thank you, I'll  take the package for  Mark.  But he was always  on the air talking  about chicks.  Hey, can we find  Hey, she's a hot  one, huh?  All right, the  mics are off.  Hey, intern, drop  that cart and pick  it up again.  Hey, hey, I'm the 
[01:10:30]  rear admiral.  He'd call himself the  rear admiral.  Hey, uh, can we  find out where Rick  is with this tape?  Almost done.  Okay, we also  have, uh, something  that, uh, Martini  Steve put together  for the show today,  Anthony.  Oh.  You had a, uh, a  pretty big rant  about kids this  week.  I want to separate  myself from that  rant.  I thought you went  a little too far.  Do you?  I think you have  some deep issues  from your childhood.  No.  And your upbringing.  No, my whole take 
[01:11:00]  is, uh, it's simple.  I, Opie, I love  kids.  I, I, I love  kids too.  Can't wait to have  my own someday.  See, I was  misunderstood that  day.  You don't really  like kids.  I was misunderstood.  And you don't want  any kids.  I like kids.  You, you  misunderstand me.  I like kids.  I like well-behaved  children that aren't  mine.  And, uh, I, I  don't want to have  kids because I like  the spontaneity of  my life and I like  the freedom to just 
[01:11:30]  flee the area if I  want to or need to  at any given  moment.  And, uh, kids  don't, uh, allow  you that.  That's all.  That's all I was  saying.  Did it come out  harsh?  Ah.  Martini, Steve.  And he's got a  tray of martinis.  He knows his  power to need  martinis.  All right, Steve.  Thank you, Steve.  He's sharing.  Look at you with  that, uh, tray of  martinis.  Oh, don't, easy.  Right up to the  tippy top, that  one.  Whoa.  Hey, oh. 
[01:12:00]  What's up, Steve?  Oh, that's a dry  martini.  Enough olives for  everyone.  That's great.  Hey, Steve, you  noticed that, uh,  uh, hmm, they  couldn't really pan  the website last  night?  Let's just put it  that way.  Yeah, I noticed  that.  I was kind of  happy.  I was thrilled.  I saw the, uh,  the clip on.  I think we could  just say anything.  I think we could  just say notice they  couldn't really pan  too much around your  website last night.  I saw, um, I  saw a banner ad.  Yeah.  On your website.  Uh-huh.  for a girl that, uh, 
[01:12:30]  I discovered a  while back.  That's right.  Tawny Stone.  Excellent discovery,  by the way.  Tawny Stone.  Have you heard  about this chick on  the web?  I heard you talking  about it.  Tawny Stone.  19 years old.  Don't know really  from what state she  originates.  I don't know.  She looks like one  of those Midwestern  girls or something.  She's 19 and, uh,  it doesn't look like  she's changed, uh,  in the past couple  of years, let's just  say.  Yeah, a little bit  of scented growth. 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  And they, quite  provocative pictures  indeed.  And she looks like  the all-American girl.  Yeah.  And, uh, I was  checking out some of  the free porno sites  that are, uh,  afforded to, uh,  it's, it's amazing.  You, you go to some  of these sites and  they're completely  free.  Completely free.  Yeah.  You download, you  can see thumbnails and  then you click on them  and they are full-size  pictures.  And this girl, uh,  Tawny Stone was on  there.  And I noticed the  banner ad when, uh,  I somehow saw your  web, your web page 
[01:13:30]  somewhere.  Yeah.  And I looked and  went, oh my God,  there's a porno ad.  I just thought it was  weird that I was  looking at your  website and I didn't  even have my computer  on it.  I was on my computer  and I'm looking,  going, look, I'm  multitasking.  Yeah.  Hey, that was one of  the ads that popped up.  All right, let's go  to the phones.  Then we'll play this  kid thing that Steve  put together.  Hey, Dan, what's up?  Hey, guys, I, um,  was on Morpheus  downloading stuff to  you.  Yeah.  And, uh, when did  last time you had  Paul Pauly Shore on? 
[01:14:00]  He brought up Mark  Parenteau.  Really?  And you guys were  talking to him and  listening to this clip  I downloaded, if you  can hear it.  Okay.  All right.  This might be.  Yeah, well, then we  told the whole town  of the mayor's office.  So what happened to  Parenteau?  Hey, Mark Parenteau.  Uh, yeah, the rear  admiral.  He was up against us  at, uh, Q104 and we,  um, we kicked his ass.  So that's what it was?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you guys are all  from Boston, though?  No, we're from New York.  We, we went up there 
[01:14:30]  for a job.  Falling asleep again  listening to Paul Pauly Shore.  And, uh, three years  later, we joined Mal and  got fired.  And where is he now?  Mark?  I don't know.  Probably, probably  with a young boy.  Oh!  Look at that.  I'm like Kreskin.  How do you like that?  I'm like Kreskin.  Wow.  As if probably  with a young boy.  And lo and behold,  I know, that's not a stretch.  That isn't a stretch.  Where's Ben?  With a drink.  You know, it's really  not a stretch.  All right. 
[01:15:00]  Thank you, Dan.  How do you like  that little thing?  That's pretty good.  Very good.  That's a few years ago, too.  So, all right.  All right, bye.  Peace.  Good call, Angel.  I'm predicting the future.  Not bad.  All right, so you went off  on this rant about kids,  Anthony.  Yeah.  And Martini Steve  took your little audio.  Very good, Martini Steve.  Disgraceful, by the way.  Disgraceful.  Thank you, Jim.  It's not me  who's saying this stuff.  I know.  Okay.  Oh, you're separating  yourself as well?  I certainly am.  Yeah, Anthony.  We're disgusted  with you today.  Yeah. 
[01:15:30]  Good, good.  You're a grateful man.  Please be disgusted  with me.  There's one pause in there.  I won't say a word.  You'll know where  it's the pause.  Well, let's take a listen.  Hey, okay.  Good.  Hit the other one.  Good.  Disgusted with me.  Good.  Good.  Good.  Let those without sin  cast the first stone,  let me say.  Or head.  I don't know nothing.  I don't know nothing.  Disgusted with me. 
[01:16:00]  Oh.  I'm holding.  There's nothing on that cart.  What happened?  Martini Steve.  Uh-oh.  Have you been drinking  martinis made with  the head cleaner  for the cart machines again?  No.  One of the joys  of working in a place  with ancient technology  is the fact that  every once in a while  one of the carts  does not record  despite the fact  that you swear to God  that you recorded it.  Yeah, sure you did.  There he goes.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  He just threw the cart.  He's got quite a temper  on him.  Oh, my God.  He's really pissed off. 
[01:16:30]  And he still didn't  spill a drop, huh?  I know.  He threw the cart  and the, uh...  Oh, the martini  waved a little  in that big glass.  And then he daintily  licked the side  of the glass  with that little  drop of martini  spilled out.  He's so deftly licked.  Hey, Rick,  are we ready?  Are we ready?  We're inching, uh,  closer and closer.  There's a lot of...  Curses.  I know that.  He was just...  It's brutal.  So we're trying  to clean it up  Well, we know that.  Just to make sure  there are no dumps  whatsoever. 
[01:17:00]  So probably in the next  five, ten minutes  he'll be done.  Is that, uh...  Yeah.  Oh, he totally got you, dude.  I don't care what you say.  Hey, Fred.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey, Fred.  What's up, Fred?  I'm going to tell you  a few things.  You want to tell us  a few things?  Yeah, first of all,  Pat Bento  was actually  with the great  he has a long hair now. 
[01:17:30]  Long brown hair.  Look, man,  I only got a couple  hours of sleep.  I can't deal with that.  Yeah.  What was he...  What was he even  trying to talk about?  It was Pat Benatar  and then he's...  You heard Pat Benatar  in there?  I certainly did.  Oh, Pat Benatar  has long brown hair.  Yeah.  Oh, now I understand.  Yes, I was...  Great.  Wow, that's what we need  for today's show.  Yes.  A Pat Benatar  hair update.  Jesus.  Come on.  Is Brian Regan  still coming in today? 
[01:18:00]  Brian Regan?  Was he supposed to?  Yeah, he was supposed to.  No?  Yeah.  He's coming in today?  I think he's supposed  to slide in for a little bit.  Yeah.  At what time?  Like around now.  Around now.  Good.  I didn't know that.  Really?  You sure he wants  to be seen with us today?  Oh, no.  I'm the nice guy.  I'm the nice guy.  What about our other guest  that was supposed to come in?  What about our other guest? 
[01:18:30]  What about our other guest  that was supposed  to come in today?  Tracy is still very sick  from yesterday.  Tracy, our other guest.  And A.C.  A.M. Hall  is also sick.  Ah.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah,  a stomach ailment of some sort.  Really?  Oh, my God.  Anthony Michael Hall.  Anthony Michael Hall  is backed out  of the Opie and Anthony appearance.  Oh, annoying.  It has begun.  Backed out?  The backlash.  It has begun.  That's something  about a sickness. 
[01:19:00]  Separate yourselves.  Sick, when you got a show  on such a hot network  coming up,  you'd hate to alienate everybody.  Ah, boy.  All right.  Ah, wheelchair friend,  what's up?  I don't know what happened.  We were disconnected before.  Oh, we got disconnected?  So what were you saying?  I put on a wall  and she's  long brown hair now.  She looks really good. 
[01:19:30]  Hey, can we go  to the FU line, maybe?  There might be something  that, well, maybe  there's nothing there.  Oh, Steve,  you got the bit?  Oh, there it is.  Oh, thank you, Steve.  Mm-hmm.  We'll go to this again.  MS.  Ah, there you go.  That's a good one  from Donella  in Charlotte, North Carolina.  Hey, you see?  F and die, bitch. 
[01:20:00]  Thank you, Alfie.  We're not even on  in North Carolina.  I know.  So who am I yelling to?  You're absolutely right.  So don't.  Don't what?  I don't know.  Listen.  Listen.  I wish so much  I could use the C word.  Cervical cancer.  The one that goes  C-U, right?  And then there's  another letter, right?  And then it ends  with a T. 
[01:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  That one.  That word.  Cult?  Oh.  I lunged the button.  Cult.  Yes.  No, I didn't mean that.  What's her problem?  She doesn't even  listen to our show.  Exactly.  She's just assuming  everything she heard.  Making all kinds  of assumptions.  She's a fat housewife.  You shouldn't assume  too much, pig.  You pig.  You pig from  Charlotte, North Carolina.  Go F your father, pig.  It's not her. 
[01:21:00]  What's this?  I'm not talking to you, Fred.  I'm not talking to you.  That would be an option.  Oh.  Fred, what's wrong  with your phone today, Fred?  I don't know.  Keep my cell phone.  I don't think it's your phone.  It can't be our phone.  We're here,  and you're right over there,  and, uh...  We're over here.  And you're not there anymore.  Uh, Anthony,  we got the kids thing.  This is the kids rant.  Oh, oh.  So Martini Steve,  uh, made a little bit. 
[01:21:30]  You love your kids,  but sometimes  they can be a handful.  Kids are great  when they're other people.  Who can you trust  when it comes to your young'uns?  You change them.  You wash them.  You bathe them.  Anthony's daycare oasis  is a paradise.  You're in prison.  You're in baby goddamn prison.  Filled with joy.  We don't think they're cute.  Tenderness.  We think they're annoying.  And most of all,  Anthony's love.  I can only hope  your child turns up  like little Adam Walsh  without his head.  Parents adore our staff.  These guys hate kids.  And our facilities are safe. 
[01:22:00]  I have burning cauldrons of wax  just sitting around  for aesthetic.  Just listen to these happy children  frolic through  Anthony's daycare oasis.  I hate your kid  and I wish him dead.  Just take it from Anthony himself.  Grab your little friggin' rat  and say  we love you, Anthony.  That was a little harsh.  What a disgrace.  You're awful.  I was taken out of context  by Martini Steve.  That little pause 
[01:22:30]  without his head.  I was taken out of context  by Martini Steve.  You're awful.  You're awful.  I swear I was.  All right.  When we get back,  finally,  the Billy Staples audio,  okay?  Right.  Of him bombing  when he warmed up  for Jim Norton  a couple weeks ago  at the Count Basie Theater  in Red Bank.  Thanks for calling  and here's the  Opian Anthony F.U. line.  This is an F.U.  for Helen,  the nastiest sea I know.

Columbus,  this is Keith Dennis  for Dennis Hyundai,  and we believe about 4%  of you are in the market  at any given time  for a new car.  So to the rest of you,  we feel compelled  to issue a failure  to purchase alert.  That's right.  Be forewarned.  We feel compelled  to save you  from at least not considering  what may be the opportunity  of a lifetime.  Let's look at the facts.  Hyundai incentives  have never been this high.  Used car values 
[01:26:30]  are at a historical peak,  and interest rates  haven't been this low  in 30 years.  This all means  that if you're not  in the market  for a new Accent,  Elantra, Tiburon,  Sonata, or Santa Fe,  you should be.  Add to this  the Hyundai advantage  of five years,  60,000 mile  bumper-to-bumper protection,  five years of roadside assistance,  and 10-year,  100,000 mile  powertrain coverage,  and it's easy  to make the case  that it may cost you  more to keep  your current car  than to get into  the new Hyundai  of your choice.  We just couldn't  live with ourselves  unless we issued  this alert  as a public service.  You may be thanking us

[01:37:30]  Medford?  Medford tonight,  Levittown tomorrow,  and then Medford Sunday.  Wow.  That's back and forth.  I don't understand it.  Medford's great.  When it gets dark,  you can see the  lights of London  over the horizon  just about  at the horizon  if you look  way out there,  Brian.  It's way out  east on Long Island.  I will,  I will,  I look towards  the horizon?  Yeah, look,  look east.  East.  It's so far.  See,  it was kind of  funny because 
[01:38:00]  it's so ridiculous.  You can't possibly  see the lights of England.  No way.  The curvature of the earth  would come into play.  Maybe the tallest building  like Big Ben  or something.

[01:38:30]  these days.  Have you watched  the news lately,  Brian?  I don't know  whether to go  with that or not.  Vaguely, you know,  I'm vaguely familiar  with what's going on.  Looks like they got  to you, too.  I see you got the scar  in your forehead as well.  They got to.  Oh, no, they got to.  You cut out his brain,  you bloody baboons.  Yeah.  I don't know why.  What's going on?  Nothing we can talk about.  No, nothing. 
[01:39:00]  I just can tell  by looking at you  that you're hip  to the story.  Yeah, I heard  there was some craziness  or something.  That's good craziness.  That's as far as we'll go.  That's what Dan Rather  was calling it.  There's some craziness  going on in New York City.  Craziness.  Craziness.  All right.  All right.  Well, that's good.  I guess we can't go  there today.  No.  At least you were brave  enough to come in today.  Hey, man,  it's my pleasure.  Anthony Michael Hall  decided there's better  places to be today.  No, no. 
[01:39:30]  I want to be here.  I want to be here  where the action is,  where the craziness  comes from.  Anthony Michael Hall  got that stomach  wink, wink, flu  all of a sudden.  Some kind of stomach thing.  You might realize  the network  his show is on  and throw up.  That's the  sci-fi channel.  I was kind of  digging the show.  The Dead Zone,  it's like  Anthony Michael Hall  plays Christopher  Watkins' part  and they made it  into a series.  And it's pretty good.  I wanted to hate it.  I wanted to just  joke on it  and goof on it  but I watched it 
[01:40:00]  and it was pretty good.  And now I hate  saying that  because for some reason  he's not here today.  I just wish  he would have  came up with  a better excuse.  Belly ache.  I got a tummy ache.  The one I used to use  in school.  I used to use that one  all the time.  I got a stomach ache.  You know what I told  the gym teacher once  because I didn't know  that I wasn't  supposed to have these?  You ever get  stomach pains  because of gas?  Oh yeah.  And my mother said  Oh,  my mother would be like 
[01:40:30]  Oh,  you're cramping up.  You're cramping up  because of that.  I went to the gym teacher  and said  I can't participate today.  I have cramps.  And he looked at me  and he started laughing.  He goes,  I have cramps.  He goes,  you can't have cramps.  He goes,  only girls have cramps.  And I'm feeling this pain  from the gas.  I go,  no,  I have cramps.  I was having my period  and I didn't even know.  It was all right 
[01:41:00]  in the cotton pony.  I used to get  like this  sharp,  intense pain  in the right side  of my rib cage.  It lasted for about,  I mean,  it was over a three year period.  Like every two or three months  it would just  come out of nowhere.  It would kill.  I would literally  like fall on the floor.  Wasn't that running pain  that you'd get?  It was worse than that.  It was just like  the sharpest pain  I had ever experienced.  And I would like  fall on the floor  and my parents would go,  well,  it's growing pains.  Don't worry about it.  I mean,  how vague of a diagnosis  is growing pains? 
[01:41:30]  I can't even stand up.  Don't worry about it.  It's growing pains.  You're growing.  That's what happens  when you grow.  You get pains.  Oh,  I recognize that hideous  scream.  Those are growing  pain screams.  Your rib is growing  into your lung  right now  at an accelerated rate.  Oh my gosh.  You're bleeding  from the mouth. 
[01:42:00]  It's growing pain.  I never got it,  you know,  officially diagnosed  and then they went,  they went,  you know,  they only lasted  like three years.  I only had to endure it  for over like a two  or three year period.  Three years  and you never went  to the doctor  because it was just  growing pains.  it was like every  three or four months  it was just,  I'd just be sitting  there eating fish sticks  or something  and then,  you know,  and then it would  just kill me  and it would last  about a minute  and then it would  go away for another  three months.  How many,  how many kids  did your parents have?  A lot.  Eight.  Eight.  Okay,  that explains it.  Yeah.  You can't be taking  every one of these kids  to the doctor 
[01:42:30]  with every pain  so it's like,  let Brian roll around  in agony on the floor  and we'll just tell him  it's growing pain.  I got dinner to make  for the other seven.  Yeah,  if we lose one  I'll barely even notice.  Get out of the kitchen  with your growing pains.  Yeah,  try to make fish sticks.  It's like an army  mess line.  Get out of the way.  You had to eat  the fish sticks too,  huh?  Yeah,  Fridays.  Friday was fish sticks?  No,  families with a,  you know,  with a lot of kids  had fish sticks.  What about margarine  and sugar sandwiches? 
[01:43:00]  I had that too.  Yeah,  we've talked about that  on the show.  Margarine and sugar sandwiches?  We were that though.  Really?  I was so poor.  Let me tell you,  let me tell you  a little bit  about how poor I was.  My grandma convinced us  that that's a nutritious lunch.  Not even butter,  margarine.  Margarine.  She would lay out  the Wonder Breads  and then lop it  with the margarine  and then pour the sugar  on each individual sandwich  and pop,  man.  That was lunch.  Man,  that's nice.  That is a true story,  yes.  Because you were poor. 
[01:43:30]  Let's go to Kim.  Kim has a question  for Brian Regan.  Yes,  Kim?  Hi,  Brian.  Hi,  Kim.  I saw you  at Bananas  a couple weeks ago  and Saturday morning  I opened up my cabinet  and decided to make  Pop-Tart.  No,  no,  no.  No,  I found out  my brand new  toaster oven  has a Pop-Tart setting.  Are you serious?  I swear to God,  it's a Toastmaster  and it has a Pop-Tart setting.  It says Pop-Tart on it?  It says Pop-Tart  in that little red  funky Pop-Tart logo.  Or does it say  poster pastry? 
[01:44:00]  Because, you know,  they've got to use  the generic term  unless it's used by...  Some companies  are in cahoots,  though, you know?  Absolutely.  It's like they'll have  the Pop-Tart setting on it  or a washing machine  that'll say,  put Tide here.  And you're like,  they're in cahoots  with each other.  But if it just says detergent  or toaster pastry,  that's a whole other animal.  You wonder, like,  if they had this  big giant meeting,  you know,  with the Pop-Tart CEOs  and the toaster oven  head honchos.  Hey, how about  we work together  and instead of going 
[01:44:30]  with the generic  toaster pastry term,  we write Pop-Tarts  on there,  we corner the market,  we start making millions!  And you could put  on the instructions,  put into  Proctor Silex  toaster oven  would rule  the toaster pastry  and toaster oven world!  That's right!  Because they got it  on the other end!  Yeah, that's right.  I don't know anything  about business!  Why are they going  to put the Pop-Tart  button on there 
[01:45:00]  if they're not getting  a little kickback  from the Pop-Tart people?  That's not a quid pro quo.  Right!  That's just quid.  It's something.  Hey, Andrew,  what's going on?  Hey, Dumb.  Hey, Dumber.  Hey, what's up?  Thank you.  How you doing,  little Jimmy?  Hello, sir.  Brian, I was wondering  if you liked  peanut butter  and jelly sandwiches.  Yeah!  Yes, I...  We're heading  down this road already?  This happens  a little bit later.  A little bit later.  Don't mention it  around here, guys.  I get right into it.  The listeners know 
[01:45:30]  we're struggling today.  Sit right down.  We can't wait  for Opie and Anthony  to get to this.  Oh, yeah, man.  I'm going to be talking  about all the  controversial stuff.  Yeah!  I'm coming after  peanut butter and jelly.  I'm coming after  Pop-Tarts.  I'm coming after  T-shirts.  Did anyone ever tell you  you shouldn't talk  about peanut butter  and jelly  because you might  get in trouble  if you do?  Perhaps you should  steer away  and move on  to something else.  No one ever  comes to  side stage  as you're doing it  and makes that 
[01:46:00]  slashing of the throat  with their finger motion.  This could be a problem.  This could be a problem  if this conversation  continues kind of thing.  Imagine like some...  You've never been upset  because they're still  making the sandwich.  Okay.  Noted.  Avoid topic.  Noted.  Because I know  when we talk about  peanut butter and jelly,  we go into those  peanut butter and jelly  meetings  and it gets really ugly. 
[01:46:30]  And they're not pretty.  And we had a whole show  planned around talking  about peanut butter and jelly.  And you know something?  The last minute  they said we can't talk  about peanut butter and jelly.  The whole thing,  the whole topic  was out the window?  Out the window.  We can't even talk  about how  maybe if they were  doing a news special  on peanut butter and jelly,  how they presented  peanut butter and jelly.  It is such  an off-limits topic.  PB&Js.  So now we've got 
[01:47:00]  to sit and wonder.  Hey, you know what  I was wondering  about that topic?  Yeah.  Sometimes they put  peanut butter and jelly  in the same jar.  Have you noticed that?  Yeah.  That is like,  that's nuts.  Really.  And I don't know  if I'm going into  like some territory  where your lawyers  are going to have  to get in here or not.  But is there  a point to that?  I mean, I'm lazy,  but I want to meet  the guy who needs that.  You know,  I could go for a sandwich,  but I'm not going 
[01:47:30]  to open two jars.  I can't be opening  and closing  all kinds of jars,  cleaning,  who knows how many knives.  You know,  if you're that hungry,  you just, you know,  or lazy,  put some croutons in there.  You get the whole sandwich  on one spoon.  Oh!  Oh, my God,  I'm going to have  a second one.  Oh, scrumptious!  That's what's the first!  Or sometimes  you might want to,  you don't want to  clean the spoon,  so you put it 
[01:48:00]  on a squeeze bottle.  Lunch and no cleanup!  Can life get better?  I submit that it cannot.  Come after me, lawyers!  You're on the edge.  Let's say hi to Dan.  Hey, Dan,  what's up today?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm going to be  taking a car trip  with my family pretty soon.  I was wondering,  Brian,  do you have any stories  about that?  Uh, yeah,  as a matter of fact...  You do?  Yeah, my, my, um, 
[01:48:30]  my family,  we got together  and my, my parents  gave us some peanut  butter and jelly  in the same jar  in the back of the car.  No, no, no.  That never happened.  No, no, no.  Well, we'll get into  that in a moment.  Of course.  Don't worry about it.  Right now,  we have to get  Pete Johnson,  our engineer,  because, uh,  my mic just fell.  I hope,  I hope this isn't a sign.  It just might be.  Yeah.  Oh, that's broken.  It was rent.  Oh, Rick,  you can't fix it. 
[01:49:00]  Your people just use  duct tape.  I've seen your cars.  I broke it.  You broke it.  Oh, that fitting is broke.  That little piece.  I'll say.  Oh, this mic is effed.  Well, why don't we  take a break, Anthony?  I'll leave it hanging  there for a moment.  We have the Billy Staples  audio.  It's ready to go.  It's right to my left.  We're going to play it next,  okay, and Brian Regan's  going to help us out.  You have it?  Yeah, finally.  Oh, great, because Brian  Regan, obviously, a very  popular stand-up comic.  And I want to ask you, 
[01:49:30]  have you ever bombed?  Yes.  You have?  Yes.  I bombed, uh, it was  the second show Friday  in 1987.  It was horrible.  You remember it.  You've never bombed,  have you?  What are we talking about?  I bombed last night.  What are you talking about?  No way.  You bomb all the time.  Do you?  Yeah.  Well, is that relative,  though?  You're like,  yeah, I bombed.  Like, there was one person  in the back that was just  kind of,  no, I...  They weren't crying  with laughter.  I mean, you get to where  you can kind of fake it,  you know what I mean? 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  But you know,  you know in your heart  you're bombing,  you know?  Really?  You know, but usually  like in a comedy club  environment,  it's pretty cool.  But every once in a while  you'll get in a situation  where...  I can't see you bombing.  Ah, well...  I can't see...  Hey, I'm bombing!  Hey, I'm bombing!  That happens sometimes.  No?  It's horrible.  Oh, Pete Johnson.  You know, I'll tell you,  I was doing a corporate show  and I literally...  Ah, Pete,  Brian Regan's talking.  That's all right.  I was doing a corporate show  and I literally heard... 
[01:50:30]  I did a joke,  it got no laughs,  and it was in the Pacific Northwest,  it was like off an island  off of Seattle.  Joke got nothing.  I literally heard  crickets outside,  like...  Oh, Applewoods.  And I just started laughing,  you know,  because I was like,  oh man,  I've heard about hearing crickets.  I've never actually,  actually heard the crickets.  And then the audience laughed  because they could hear  the crickets too  and they sort of  were on my side  for like the next few moments  until the next joke. 
[01:51:00]  Where'd you get a corporate gig  at Microsoft?  That's pretty nice.  Yeah, that was...  Microsoft?  Yeah, some division  of Microsoft  or some damn thing.  That's all that's going on  out there.  Why else are they...  What other corporation?  Hey, we're Beavers  and we love Brian Regan  out on this little island  off in the Pacific Northwest.  It's Microsoft  or Beavers.  Keep it vague.  I don't know why  I don't want to say  the company news.  I don't want to say it,  but it's on a small island.  It's Dr. Evil 
[01:51:30]  from the Austin Powers movies  that's a volcano.  I didn't want to say Seattle  in the Pacific Northwest.  Pacific...  A small island  in the Pacific Northwest.  I'm plotting with maps.  I got charts over here  to try to figure out  where Brian was.  Where in the world  is Brian Regan?  All right, and when we get back  we got the Billy Staples audio.  Finally.  Billy bombed really bad  and we'll get Brian's opinion  on the whole thing.  Great.  I'm sure he did good, man.  I'm sure he did fine. 
[01:52:00]  Oh, Ron.  Even you cannot talk  this thing nice.  Brian, it's been a soap opera  for the last two weeks.  The guy has not come back  to work since.  He has left the state.  Really?  He's left the state.  He's left the signal.  He's embarrassed  to come back to the station.  He has left  the broadcast area  of this station  so he won't inadvertently  hear people  making fun of him.  Maybe he's in  the Pacific Northwest.  Some small island.  Some island doing gigs.  Picture Brian 
[01:52:30]  swimming up in a scuba suit.  It's the only way  to get there.  Brian Regan  playing Governors.  Medford tonight.  Levittown Saturday  and Medford on Sunday.  Very funny guy  and one of our pals.  He wasn't scared  to come in today, Anthony.  That's right.  Or maybe he doesn't know  what's going on yet.  Right when the mic's going,  hey, what happened?  Oh, I can't be here anymore. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, okay.  Gotta go.  It's a lot like porno.  Only without all  the sophisticated dialogue.  Aubrey and Anthony  Afternoons  and 107.1  The Big Wasu.  You've been planning it

[01:54:30]  that you can't find  the other paper?  Yeah.  Well, I heard they jacked  up their circulation  and they're putting  stacks of papers  in more places  every Thursday.  But it's never there  on the weekend  when I look for it.  There's a reason for that.  There is?  Yeah.  Turns out Thursday  doesn't fall on a weekend.  Everybody else is grabbing  a copy on Thursday.  By the time you look for it,  it's gone.  Oh, so then  what do I do?  Well, you can go  to their website,  theotherpaper.com.  They put all their articles  on the website? 
[01:55:00]  No, but they do have  the front page story  and a few other features,  plus a list of the places  that carry the paper  in your zip code.  Why don't they just put  all their stories  on the website?  Maybe they think  you need to get out  of the house  on Thursdays.  What?  And miss my online  bowling league?  The Other Paper.

[02:03:00]  You're checking out the O.P. and Anthony show.  Brian Regan in studio.  Oh, yeah.  Playing Governors.  Now, Governors has two locations.  He's playing the Medford Governors tonight.  Tomorrow night, he'll be in Levittown at that Governors.  On Sunday, he'll be back in Medford.  Right, Brian?  That's right.  Wow.  Right on the money.  You're making a Governor's sandwich right there. 
[02:03:30]  That's right.  A little confusing, but I think the Brian Regan fans will figure it out.  Very funny guy.  We love Brian Regan.  Oh, yeah.  He has decided to stay, Anthony.  That's very nice of him.  Hey, man.  Mighty white of him.  My pleasure.  Sorry, O.P.  I was distracted reading.  Just reading things that are being printed out from various newspapers, I guess.  Frank, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey, I told you. 
[02:04:00]  Isn't there something going on with the economy?  Yeah, there's buying and selling.  Yeah, I heard the stock market is very volatile.  It's not the only thing.  Frank.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  You're never going to believe what WCBS 2 just teased for their 5 o'clock news.  I knew it.  I knew they were going after the stock market.  What?  What?  Is it up or down?  No, Brian.  It's a story about peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  Ah, peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah.  All right.  It looks like it would be a pretty juicy story. 
[02:04:30]  Right off the top.  Thank you, Frank.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  Well, we have the Billy Staples audio, Anthony.  Peanut butter and jelly.  I think we need to move on from peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah.  I don't have to say that, but.  Covered the topic.  It's a sticky situation.  That's whack hat.  Yes, Brian.  It's going to be one of those shows.  You don't have to ask.  Just hang in there with us.  Everyone knows you're funny already. 
[02:05:00]  Okay.  This is fun, man.  I'm just enjoying it.  It's like watching a circus, man.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Did you see Pete Johnson come running in like an indie pit man and fix my mic?  Yes.  That guy is a professional, and we're all going to miss him when he retires in 11 months  or whatever the hell it is.  Ten and a half months.  Ten and a half months.  He's counting the days now.  He's counting the days.  He just 40, how many years?  44.  44 years of working at this station and it just being the smoothest sailing ever. 
[02:05:30]  All he had to hear was, hey, my microphone's a little tinny.  Okay, Scott, so I'll fix it.  Nothing like that.  Now there's staining of carpets by couples.  He replaced the carpet yesterday.  He replaced the square of carpet.  He should have had to do that.  That we had.  I know.  Why did he have to do it?  He just decided he didn't want to look at it anymore.  You notice the brand new carpet in here, Brian?  Yeah, it's very nice.  Nice, isn't it?  It is very nice.  Is there one tile of carpet that's a little cleaner than the rest? 
[02:06:00]  No, he replaced the whole thing.  Oh, he did?  He took the one out and put the only one down.  It's kind of hard to just cut a square out.  Well, these are indeed two foot by two foot squares.  Oh, they are.  Wow.  Because underneath this is some hatch door system that is akin to the old Ronan Martin laughing.  The hatches that Goldie Hawn would pop up out of and tell a joke.  There's hatches where you can get down there and get at the wires that are running all of it.  This is a floating studio.  They call it a floating studio.  So we had a couple have sex right in the corner there to christen the new rug, Brian. 
[02:06:30]  Sure.  You get a new rug, you've got to do something like that.  You can't just look at it and enjoy it.  There was stuff that remained after they left, let's just say.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Someone dropped a cornflake on the rug.  Yeah, we taped off the area.  And then somebody put a couple of napkins over the fence.  And it sat there for a day and a half until Pete Johnson, sick of looking at it, put a new piece of carpeting down. 
[02:07:00]  He is quite a professional, but he's never had to deal with stuff that he has to deal with with this show.  Correct.  Good for him.  All right.  Finally, Anthony, the Billy Staples audio that everyone's been waiting for.  Once again, Jim Norton invited Billy Staples to warm him up, what, two weeks ago at Red Bank.  Wasn't it at Billy's prompting, though?  Didn't Billy say?  He didn't.  Not begging, but he brought it up first.  Yeah, kind of like joking, because Ron and Fez were going to help promo the gig.  So he's like, hey, maybe you can put me on. 
[02:07:30]  And I'm like, yeah, you know what?  Yeah, okay.  Cool.  And so I was happy to have him.  With that smile all the time.  Yeah, maybe you can put me on.  All right.  Okay.  And he hasn't been seen since.  Yeah.  He finally called Ron and Fez last night.  Oh, he wasn't a happy Billy.  Yeah, hi, how you doing?  Yeah.  It was, well, I don't know what to do.  I'm very depressed.  I bombed.  I had a horrible time.  And as my life, he goes, he goes, Ron, my life isn't falling apart. 
[02:08:00]  My life fell apart.  And he goes, the only thing I have left is this dream of being on the stage and being  a comic.  And I've been doing stand-up for nine years, and I cannot now get back on the stage.  He goes, how do you recover from something like this?  Just get back on.  I know.  He was crying.  It was disgusting.  I mean, I understand he's hurt, but you've got to go back on.  Like a horse.  And just going, oh, stop it already.  Stop your whining. 
[02:08:30]  Exactly, like a horse.  If you fall off the horse, you run after the horse, you punch it, and you get back  on.  Right.  Right.  Or if a horse gags you, you've got to just spit it out and keep going.  If a horse or a mule kicks you in the face, you kick it back.  Right.  Here was Ron's reaction, though, to Billy crying last night.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  He smacked him in the face.  It was great.  But I've got to say, it's not Billy's fault. 
[02:09:00]  Well, Tom left.  He thinks they all booed because of his act.  He never got a chance, Brian, to do his act.  It was that, the crowd was that hostile.  Maybe it sounded like boo, but it was Billy Staples.  Oh, no.  Billy Staples.  There was an a-hole chant.  Oh.  There was a, how do you.  No, no, no.  That's Staples.  Staples.  See?  You've got to look at it like riding a bike.  You know, if a girl gets off, you smell the seat while she runs into the store.  There, see?  You've got to apply philosophy like that. 
[02:09:30]  I don't think there's a positive spin on get off the stage, you fat.  It's really not.  Now, we've got the audio.  Billy comes in crystal clear.  You can't really hear the crowd.  Well, we boosted it a little bit, right, Rick?  We did.  How'd that work out?  We were hard at work.  We double layered it.  We tried to boost the crowd and bring up Billy and kind of match it as best we could.  There's going to be a bit of a hiss, but that's just the hiss from the VCR.  Yes, I hate the hiss.  God forbid that when they record it and you're paying to have it recorded from the actual venue that it should sound properly. 
[02:10:00]  Who would want the audience mic for a live recording?  And part of the problem, too, is that when he starts screaming into the mic, it freaks the mic out.  Because he just starts...  Regardless if you could hear the crowd or not, the most important thing, listen to the desperation in his voice.  Listen to how distracted he is and how he cannot even get words out because he is so preoccupied with the crowd heckling him.  Well, but first, on the phone, we've got Ron from Ron and Fed.  Ron. 
[02:10:30]  Hey.  Hey, guys.  Ron.  Ron.  Ron.  Yeah.  You'll still hang out with us, right?  Uh, kind of.  Kind of.  Ken and I are both waiting to see what the lawyers say.  Right.  And then we'll have an opinion.  Very good.  Very good strategy.  We're using that one.  You know, I said to Ken and Jeremy, geez, what do you think of this?  That's it, huh?  Maybe it's time for Ron and Fed to be on three shifts today. 
[02:11:00]  Just turned into the Ron and Fed station at this point.  I'm like, hey, I noticed those replays are trending up.  That's great.  Ron, we finally got the audio.  Billy Staples.  Of course, we're going to leave it for you guys tonight.  I don't even know if it should be played.  Why?  You know what kind of shape he's in.  He's suicidal.  Let me tell you something.  I listened to your show when you talked to Billy on the phone.  I wanted to reach through and smack him.  I wanted to smack him in the face. 
[02:11:30]  He was just the most whining.  Yeah.  He's pathetic.  He really is.  When he said, my life isn't falling apart, my life fell apart.  Hey, look at that.  They're talking about peanut butter and jelly on Channel 2.  Oh, where is that?  Oh, look at that.  Hold on there, Ron.  Now there's...  Why are the Rockettes there?  Well, it's a coming attraction.  Oh, it's what they call a teaser.  They're teasing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich story on Channel 2. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  Sorry, Ron.  Yeah.  Hey, if you missed that one, another one's coming on in five.  They've been on all day.  A lot of interest in peanut butter and jelly.  Yeah, it really is.  Talk about going the other extreme.  So you bring me in to do some Pop-Tart jokes.  Right.  Sure.  You bring Regan in.  It's like the sunlight after a bad storm.  Right.  I don't know.  Regan is like when O.J. was hanging around with Rosie Greer the next day. 
[02:12:30]  Yeah.  And everybody's like, hey, Rosie Greer's great.  So therefore, by association...  Yeah, Brian's such a nice guy.  I never even heard him use a curse word on stage.  No, he doesn't.  That's right.  The good boy.  Ron, at one point today, it was only raining over this building.  Yeah.  No joke.  That was a little odd.  A little strange.  Ah, you never know.  All right, so why don't we get to the audio of Billy Staples, okay? 
[02:13:00]  You know, but also let people know that don't know Billy, he's already been through five  rehabs.  Yeah, you've got a little more of a background on what his destroyed life is a little more  about.  He's been through five rehabs, and when we were talking to him last night, he's slurring.  So the newest chip is out the window, I'm sure.  Oh, and you asked him if he was doing any drinking.  You promised you won't drink, and he said, I can't promise anything.  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  What does it matter?  He had that whole attitude of just, oh, me, poor me, I'm just going to cash it in. 
[02:13:30]  I'm just...  And you know, here's the thing, too.  His second marriage broke up, so he moved home with his mom, and he's 44 years old, and  he's sleeping in the same room as he did in high school.  So he's waking up in that single bed now, and he's looking up at these old faded Terry Bradshaw  and Peter Frampton posters that he had there in the 70s.  This should have been part of his intro. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  See?  This would have set the plate nice for him.  You know, he's a lovable guy, but, you know, they're not called lovable clubs.  They're really not.  You know, you have to have comedy.  He's got to realize he has a good gig with your show, and he's being way too hard on himself.  Sure, he's the phone guy.  He's doing great.  It's an entry-level position.  He's at midlife.  Dude, are you just hoping that he kills himself on your show live? 
[02:14:30]  This is before the tape, please.  That's harsh.  But, I mean, so he's going through a lot.  Yeah.  And I love how everyone is saying, now, when you listen to this tape, everyone says,  oh, you know something?  You could be the funniest comic in the world and come out there,  and they would have booed anyway, and everyone goes, yeah, yeah.  But he's not.  He's not the funniest comic.  No.  I mean, you know.  I don't know.  I've never seen what he does.  I can't say he is or is.  I honestly don't know.  Where were you?  Where were you when these hijinks and shenanigans were going on? 
[02:15:00]  I was watching it from the back.  What were you saying?  What were you involved saying to each other?  Come on.  Just kind of laughing.  How do you laugh?  Because I like Billy.  When you're watching one of your friends take it in the face, you have to enjoy it.  You think I'm rooting for other comics, too?  I want them all to go down in flames.  Yeah, that's true.  No one knew what he was doing.  You like to watch other comics, Bob, because it makes you feel better about yourself.  Even you, Brian Regan?  Oh, yeah, of course.  Yeah.  Wow.  It's the most controversial thing I've ever heard you say.  Well, Brian's going to be commenting about Billy Staples here. 
[02:15:30]  Let me rethink this.  Let me take this back.  All right, Ron, you want to stay on the phone for the playing of the tape?  Sure, and then after that, we'll listen to my sister get raped.  Oh, man.  All right, let's start the tape.  All right.  Pleasure bringing up our next act.  You're going to love this guy.  He's a good friend of mine.  He's been on Comedy Central.  He's been on MTV.  He's a regular Ron and Fez.  Billy Staples, a big hit. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  What the f*** were you expecting, Fabio?  All right, so he starts out.  Now, they seem to be applauding, though, when he came out.  I heard, like, applause, and then I heard a slow turn to boo.  There's a little low boo rumbling.  Yeah, a little low boo. 
[02:16:30]  But there was, like, yay.  I think William didn't take charge immediately.  You can't.  I told you that Bill Maher story in Phoenix.  Open for dice.  You can't sometimes stand there and just go, damn, all right.  If you hear them applaud and then this low murmur of booze,  you've got to get right to the mic and start rapping.  This is not the L.A. Improv on a Saturday evening.  I mean, these are a bunch of drunken pigs.  You know, I'm not on the road anymore.  Is the Fabio stuff still current for us? 
[02:17:00]  I've been opening with it, but I get to it quicker.  Yeah.  Fabio.  Yes.  That might have been a problem right off the bat.  What were you expecting, Rock Hudson?  I mean, I look like Frankie Lyman.  But, you know, it's not a bad joke.  It just didn't fly.  He attacked right away, though.  Yeah.  He attacked the crowd right away.  Yeah, implying they were expecting something.  All right, back to the tape.  Jesus Christ. 
[02:17:30]  That's why I'm a f***ing radio.  Uh-oh.  Oh, the f***ing dog yelling at me.  I'm sure what the hell f***ing good you look over there.  I think he got a good applause there.  You've got to laugh.  It seemed like he struck back at one of the hecklers.  Unfortunately, there were about 499 more.  And you shouldn't agree with them.  You know, what the heck?  What do you think I'm on radio for?  Of course, look at me.  You can trip.  You can rip yourself.  But you've got to, pow! 
[02:18:00]  You smack the guy in the face and then trash yourself.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't give in.  Like, you know, I'm not knocking him.  He hasn't been on stage much because he's doing radio.  Like, boo.  Because they were yelling.  What you couldn't hear was, you fat F.  He was wearing the big orange shirt.  So people were yelling, you look like an effing pumpkin.  And they were really being brutal.  So then he did a little of that self-deprecating humor.  Well, what does Brian think so far?  You know, he got heckled.  He came back.  You know, he's trying to get control.  You know, he's doing his thing.  Right? 
[02:18:30]  You are good.  They send you to the Middle East.  Hey, why don't you Jews get along with the Palestinians?  Actually, we should send them down the hall.  Palestinian even starts with pal.  So why don't you just be their pal?  And Israel starts with is.  Pal is.  We could is be pal.  Is be our pal.  All right.  Back to Billy.  There it is.  Wow. 
[02:19:00]  See you right there.  Hey, you guys got paintball guns?  All right.  Then I'm staying up here.  Hey, guys, welcome.  Come on, seriously.  Welcome to Red Bank.  A town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons on the shore.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.  It sounded like they were starting to laugh and then you guys cut it.  I like the local stuff.  He's doing a lot of local stuff.  Yeah.  He's relating.  Some local color. 
[02:19:30]  He, I like, that was the first of the seriously.  That was the first of the seriously.  When he says seriously, he's pleading, oh, please let me just start my act.  All kidding aside, guys.  Yeah, all kidding.  All right.  I know you're heckling and yelling and we've been having a good time.  Yeah.  But now we got to get down to brass tacks.  I've got with that jockey.  Settle down.  Settle down.  Let's go back.  Brian thinks he might have got a laugh.  Well, it sounded like they were starting to laugh at the joke there. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, guys, welcome.  Come on.  Seriously, welcome to Red Bank, a town that's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons  on the shore.  A little bit.  And a huge, huge sock.  You suck.  Now, here we go.  But that's one guy yelling that while the rest is laughing.  I'm going to hear a few laughs and one really loud, you suck.  I'm going to be brutally honest right here now.  I'm going to be brutally honest.  Here's what happened.  He says that people were yelling right when he came out.  He's right.  They were.  That was his chance right there. 
[02:20:30]  You heard when he goes, welcome to Red Bank.  Seriously, welcome to Red Bank.  There was not a peep.  There wasn't a peep.  That was his shot now to win the audience over with a huge opening.  It absolutely was.  If we could again.  Okay.  Perhaps.  All right.  They shut up for him when he said seriously.  Keep talking.  I got to go.  All right.  The old fast way.  Keep talking.  We can't talk about things.  Maybe the choice of tampon didn't work out for him.  Yeah, maybe that. 
[02:21:00]  Maybe tamponing might have helped a little bit.  I think Brian enjoys a bloody tampon joker once in a while, right?  You never know.  Everyone has their different style.  Yeah.  He's got a style.  Is that, you pull that out in the third set, right?  Yeah, that's late night stuff.  Yeah.  That's Reggie Bell's material.  All right.  Do you want to hear this again?  Yeah.  Let's hear it.  Hey, guys.  Welcome.  Come on.  Seriously.  Welcome to Red Bank.  That's an Indian name for washed up bloody tampons on the shore.  That's got a laugh, too.  That's got a laugh. 
[02:21:30]  That's what I'm saying.  It's my laugh.  That's a lot of heckling.  All right, already.  We heard you, you stupid f***.  Not really.  That actually got a nice laugh.  There was one really loud heckler, but you got to smash that guy really hard.  That's the thing.  He's got enough of a base where if he can shut the one guy down.  Right.  He had it right there.  That was his moment.  He got a little bit of a laugh.  He should have smacked the guy in the face and then, boom, right again with some strong  stuff.  I think he was thinking more of a shotgun blast at the audience than that laser comeback 
[02:22:00]  line.  Oh, is that it?  He was going to take everybody down.  The shotgun blast.  It's kind of hard to get them all back if you shut them all down.  But a guy like that, man, you got to hit him.  He's like, hey, why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?  Hey, yeah, you.  That's the crowd laughing.  A lot of people checking in that were there, Anthony, saying that the tape is not doing  the performance justice.  Everyone is saying people were screaming and yelling and heckling the whole time that you 
[02:22:30]  could barely even hear him.  Well, the fact that Marlee Maitland did the audio on this, I would like to smash this company.  Yeah, the crowd wasn't mic'd, obviously.  Why would you on a live performance?  Who needs the crowd?  So just keep that in mind.  I mean, they were just riding him really hard.  It's a lot louder than it sounds in this tape.  So when it's silent, there were people screaming.  Yeah.  All right.  Imagine what it sounded like in his head.  All the demons screaming at him.  Booze, pills, and the audience. 
[02:23:00]  He's adding to the chorus.  In his defense, he had that stomach stapling thing, and it didn't take.  I mean, that's rough to deal with.  They don't take or not take?  Well, he's gained weight since his stomach has been stapled.  He's popped a few staples.  How do you break that to a patient?  The stapling didn't take.  Sorry, your stapling didn't quite take.  These might just be growing pains.  That's a callback.  Yeah, go on.  Billy just didn't hit them hard enough, man. 
[02:23:30]  Maybe they made the staples out of pure butter.  Is that it?  That ties in with the Fabio.  I can't believe it's not butter.  This is the kind of stuff he needs.  If a guy heckles you like that, you've got to say to the crowd,  hey, wouldn't you like him to shut the heck up?  You know, I'll clap and get on your side.  Back to the tape.  All right.  Some of you may be saying to yourselves,  why the f*** you got a name like Staples?  Because I had that staples surgery, right?  The stomach stapling?  Doing a great job, huh? 
[02:24:00]  You guys are so f***ing kind.  Come on.  Shut the f*** up and let me do the act.  Oh, that's right.  Even Brian.  Even Brian.  That one got Brian.  That's a hard moment.  That's a hard moment there.  That's a hard moment.  Let me do the act.  Oh, my God.  I know the feeling.  That was so bad.  You know the feeling, but that's the worst thing you can say.  They're not going to just sit there and go, 
[02:24:30]  oh, he makes a good point.  Okay.  That's the Jake LaMotta moment.  Don't bother me, pal.  I'm trying to do my routine.  Don't bother me, pal.  It's more like he thought he was going to be the prom queen  and the blood started pouring down.  Yeah, exactly.  Wow.  You see Brian's face?  Oh.  Oh, yeah.  Brian was pained to listen to that.  Brian made the same face I saw Ken Stevens make eight times today  at different phone calls.  Okay. 
[02:25:00]  Let's hear more of the Billy Stink.  Hey, boss ain't coming back, you ****.  He's already halfway on the **** turnpike getting out of here.  All right, listen up.  Seriously, listen to me for a second. 
[02:25:30]  Well, you guys, you guys listen to ONA, of course.  When I was on ONA, I had a colonoscopy done on the air.  Any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  Any of you guys had a colonoscopy?  How about can any of you guys spell it?  This is not men that you're talking to.  They're retard, drunken lunatics.  Brian, not smart to ask the audience questions?  No.  Not in that particular situation.  Not when they're that hostile.  Yeah. 
[02:26:00]  And the question that he asked, hey, anyone colonoscopy?  Seriously, guys, 17% across the board, dags or what?  All right, well, this is great.  He takes out the Q&A now.  We get rid of the Q&A.  This is helpful.  This is working out.  It really is.  He is.  That was another very uncomfortable moment.  This just in.  Looks like Channel 5 also likes peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Boy, they're covering it.  All right.  Back to that line, Anthony. 
[02:26:30]  Well, you guys, you guys listen to ONA, of course.  When I was on ONA, I had a colonoscopy done on the air.  Any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  All right, so they're yelling and screaming, whip him out.  And being kind of a large man, he decided to lift his shirt up.  He lifted his shirt.  His man boobs.  And he got a good reaction. 
[02:27:00]  That's not a ovation.  Hey, I'll wait all night for you guys.  Get out.  Go ahead.  Hey, seriously.  Any of you guys have a colonoscopy?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  He went back.  Follow-up.  He went back.  He went back to the colonoscopy.  He's on it.  He got a little off track with the whip him out. 
[02:27:30]  And then, wham, back to the colonoscopy.  Back to the killer stuff.  Back to the killer stuff.  This is his stuff.  He's got gold.  He's got a piece of gold to bring out there for him.  I can't wait now to hear the punchline.  Oh, no.  Let's give a little listen.  Any of you guys?  Oh, I'm the only one who fell for this.  Fell for it?  Fell for it?  You were diagnosed.  You fell for it.  You're eating whole hams for 40 years. 
[02:28:00]  You didn't fall for something.  He's confused.  It wasn't like a sleight-of-hand card trick.  Oh, I fell for the colonoscopy.  Oh, I thought that was the queen.  He was making balloon animals, and before I knew it, he had a camera on my keister.  Maybe he better edit this out of his tape.  Yeah.  I'm the only one that is fall for it.  Oh, man.  All right.  Fell for this?  Let me tell you, a colonoscopy's a big pain in the ass. 
[02:28:30]  That was the kicker on that one?  The punchline.  The colonoscopy is a big pain in the ass.  Well, let's ask Brian.  Brian, it sounds like he's a funny guy.  He's got some good stuff.  You know, but it doesn't matter.  If you start off on the wrong foot, and the crowd ain't liking you, that's it.  You're dead.  You're dead in the water.  And that's the situation he was in, and, you know, I feel for him.  You can hear the hecklers organizing now.  It's more like wrestling hecklers. 
[02:29:00]  Right.  They're working as a group.  Right.  Like at the conventions, you know, the delegates who want to comment on his weight.  It's like the Iron Sheik has shown up, and he's burning an American flag.  I think that the pain in the ass line, it's not a bad, like, aside, like, thing to say.  A throwaway, right?  Yeah, a little throwaway line.  Yeah.  You don't hit that hard.  But you can't say, like, it's hard to set that up, and then go, no, no, no. 
[02:29:30]  When I was about to say, I've had the colonoscopy, and let me tell you, here it comes.  Put on your laughing hats.  Like, you don't say the serious, seriously.  It was a pain in the ass.  Get ready, Alice.  Here it comes.  Send it up a little too much.  I wouldn't send a night out on a dog like this.  Night on a dog, Alice.  Leave it there.  The cat will get it.  You have no sense of humor.  Hell, Billy Snapples.  There he is.  Right?  Well, tell you. 
[02:30:00]  Hold on.  Let me tell you.  The worst part is the f***ing reparation.  Let's go!  Shut up.  You got to...  It's not like he's drowning.  Now it's just pandemonium.  F*** you all!  And right here, he should say, seriously, anyone ever have a colonoscopy? 
[02:30:30]  Yeah, that...  Right there.  He's missing his mark again.  That's where it just rose up 20 notches and became that full group, became one entity, just  BOOM!  It literally sounds like the ump just threw Bobby Valentine out of the gate.  And Shay is going crazy!  That's where you've got to look at the crowd and go, hey, my wife likes me.  Ron and Fez like me.  Go on, pick on me if it makes you feel better.  I'm an easy target. 
[02:31:00]  I'm an easy target.  Oh, man.  His wife doesn't like him, though.  Yeah.  That's part of the sad part.  That's the sad part, right?  Once again, got to say, everyone's checking in saying the tape doesn't do it justice.  The boos were just deafening.  You could tell.  The crowd was not mic'd, unfortunately.  You could tell at that part, it was probably deafening because he can't even talk.  He's got the mic, and he's just going, I just...  I just...  But the...  Yeah.  He told us last night he was in shock.  He was in shock at that point? 
[02:31:30]  He was in shock.  Yeah, it certainly sounded like it.  Whew.  A little more?  Do we have more?  Yeah, there is a really bad A-hole chant coming up.  I don't know how much they're going to let us play, but just in case they dump out, I  just want to let you know.  It went on forever.  Did it?  All right.  You guys going to shut the f*** up for two seconds or what?  Yeah, ask him a question.  Then it better be a two-second joke.  Let me share some with you guys.  Can I at least share something with you?  I just...  They go, no. 
[02:32:00]  Good tactic.  Good tactic.  Now it's not me telling jokes.  We're all sharing.  I'm going to give you something.  We're in this together, gang.  We're sharing.  Can I share something with you guys?  We're all of the same ilk?  All right.  Can I share now?  This crowd was on.  They didn't miss a beat.  They're like, no.  Another question.  Yeah.  You can't keep asking.  He's questioning them.  Because that implies that you need them for something.  You just got to smash them.  Are you guys going to let me do this?  No.  No.  No, that's our answer. 
[02:32:30]  You asked.  You want to hear it?  No.  Does a rapist say, could you please undo the belt?  No.  No.  He just undoes it.  Do it.  Just do it.  Do it.  Jump in.  I'm not there.  Hey, let me share something with you guys.  Can I at least share something with you?  I just joined the 12-step recovery program.  I'm recovering anorexic.  Thank you.  You guys ain't going to laugh at the f***ing thing I say, are you?  That's the big...  No. 
[02:33:00]  They are one.  They are of one single mind.  You never want the crowd to become one.  They have united.  At the beginning, it was all different heckles.  He got this crowd to the point where they were one mind.  He's the white substitute teacher in Harlem right now.  That was a little painful, that joke, too.  You got to whack the crowd hard, man.  Like, if they're giving you stuff like that, you got to go, hey, I'm working. 
[02:33:30]  Do I bother you when you're working by going to McDonald's and knocking the mop out of your  hand?  Oh, ho.  Sure.  Yeah.  Everyone's elbowing each other?  That's the one.  Hey, now...  Hey, you know you're doing good when they start elbowing each other.  Yeah, I'm with you.  Oh, he's good.  Well, he makes up for the fact that he has no timing and no material by acting pathetic  and desperate.  Well, you got to bash.  Begging.  Begging that he shares.  Can I share something?  Let me share.  Like he said it once and then realized, oh, that's a good word to turn the crowd around. 
[02:34:00]  Sharing.  Sharing is caring.  Hey, I'm looking at peanut butter and jelly on TV.  Sorry, I'm a little distracted right now.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, hey, they look familiar.  Hey, there's some good news.  Okay, that's good to hear.  Good, good, good.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  That's never good.  Oh, boy.  Brian's never good when they go to the street to ask them what they think about peanut butter  and jelly.  Yeah.  Man on the street questions?  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:34:30]  That's not good.  Wow.  Oh.  Oh, gee.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  Oh, oh, there.  Okay.  They, uh, that's, uh, more stuff we can't talk about.  It's like, uh, those two don't want to comment about peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  Yeah, that's it.  And, uh, oh, well, that looks familiar.  That's a familiar place.  Mm-hmm.  I've never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in that place.  No.  Have you, Anthony?  Never.  No.  Oh, why are they talking? 
[02:35:00]  Oh, boy.  She looks like, uh, what was her name from Indiana Jones, the first one?  Allen?  Karen Allen?  Is that her name?  Yeah, she looks like her a little bit.  I know Brian is, uh, panicking a little bit.  We've got to get him out of here.  And he feels a little longer.  Oh, no.  I've got to get to Medford.  No, I know.  Oh.  You've got a really long ride.  That'll take a while.  Um.  Friday in LA, it's fun.  In the summer, when everyone's coming out to the hampshire?  Seriously, could you guys get out of the way?  This is the best time to do it, right?  I hope you have a 30 on a Friday. 
[02:35:30]  I hope you have a helicopter.  You're not going to let me get through this traffic.  All right, why don't we say goodbye to Brian?  All right.  Well, there's still some more, uh, more time on this tape.  Billy, if you're out there, hang in there, man.  I know it was a rough show.  We all have them.  You know, the crowd didn't go your way.  But, uh, you know, you're all right.  And, uh, hope to see you soon.  Get back on that horse.  Oh, that'll turn him around.  I'm trying, man.  Coming from a guy that I couldn't even imagine getting heckled at all ever on stage, Brian Reek. 
[02:36:00]  You should have seen me in the Pacific Northwest.  Oh, on that small island off the coast in the Pacific Northwest?  Somewhere.  He's the most universal comic I've ever seen.  I've seen, like, black guys and bikers.  Everybody laughs.  Whether it's some small out-of-the-way island in the Pacific Northwest or maybe somewhere near Tahiti.  Doesn't matter.  It's universal, Brian Reek.  Love having you in, Brian. 
[02:36:30]  Thanks, man.  Thank you so much.  We really needed somebody in here today.  Hey, no problem.  I hope everything works out.  And, Brian, I hope you can come back with me and Fez get the drive-time show.  Ron.  Yeah.  I love you, man.  I miss you.  Yeah, me too, buddy.  All right.  Ron.  See you soon.  Ron.  I love you like a brother, right?  Yeah.  But you saw what happened to the last two guys at Set Banner, right?  Yeah, I know.  Okay.  I know.  Just keeping it real.  Hey, I figured the four of us are leaving.  Yeah, we did.  Don't you know how I feel. 
[02:37:00]  They'll throw all our asses out of here.  Well, let's get the super agent on the phone.  What are we going to do?  That's right.  All right.  Let's say goodbye to Brian because he really has to go.  Brian Regan's going to be at Governor's tonight in Medford.  Levittown.  Levittown tomorrow night.  The Governor's over there.  And then back to Medford on Sunday.  Yeah.  Right?  So, Medford tonight and Sunday.  Tomorrow, Levittown.  Yeah, but it gets confusing, man.  That's easy.  Tonight, Sunday, Medford.  Levittown, Saturday.  Right.  Go to Levittown.  Go Saturday.  You're in Medford tonight or Sunday.  Those are your options.  That is a beautiful plug.  No.  It's not complicated. 
[02:37:30]  You just screwed it up.  It should be the radio ad.  You've got to take it one step at a time.  No.  Because the people that have plans tonight, they're not going to listen to tonight's plug.  So, you go Saturday, Governor's in Levittown.  Oh, Saturday, Governor's in Levittown.  Okay, I'm free.  Yeah.  I'm going there.  How about this?  Second show tonight in Medford is in Medford.  The first show Saturday in Levittown.  There's a first show tonight in Medford and there's a Sunday show back in Medford.  But there's also a second show in Levittown tomorrow night as well.  That's clear.  The only reason Brian said that is because his shows are sold out again.  Of course. 
[02:38:00]  Always.  I don't know, man.  No, I'm just kidding.  Go see Brian Regan.  He's hilarious.  Thank you, Brian.  Thanks.  And see Norton and see Billy Staples.  Yeah.  September 7th at Westbury Music Fair.  Old Jimmy Norton.  Let's get back to the Billy Staples tape.  Will Billy be joining you on stage at Westbury?  You know what, dude?  I'm not kidding.  If Billy wanted to go on, I'm not messing with him.  I don't do that to other comics.  Dude, he's more than welcome to work with me.  I like the guy.  Yeah.  I think he's a lot funnier than people gave him credit for.  He'd have to be.  He's more than welcome to do that. 
[02:38:30]  And I'm not even being polite.  Wow.  I wonder if he would.  You think he would take that, Ron?  I don't think that he wants oxygen anymore.  Let him come out.  It's a gig, man.  And if he just, he'll have to go on stage a few more times.  Because he is a funny guy.  It's just that he hadn't been on enough right before that.  It's something that happens.  Well, let's get back to the tape.  We've got about two more minutes left in this thing.  All right.  Because then Rich Voss comes back out.  And then Voss encourages the crowd to get Staples back in one more shot.  It gets a little crazy still here.  Billy Staples at Red Bank. 
[02:39:00]  Thank you.  You guys ain't going to laugh at the f***ing thing I say, are you?  I can be the funniest mother f***er in the world and you guys ain't going to laugh, are you?  You're not.  You guys really suck.  What's that?  This is so f***ing blows.  You guys are horrible. 
[02:39:30]  You guys are absolutely f***ing horrible.  All right.  You guys want Voss back?  Fine.  You'll get f***ing Voss back.  F*** you.  And that is where he storms off the stage.  And he says that like he's punishing the audience.  Fine.  You're like, Voss, fine.  You can't fire me.  I quit.  Right.  Yeah, that's the mentality he had at that point. 
[02:40:00]  But he must have been just completely in shock.  Didn't know what to do.  There was no way he could have jumped back in.  So he just said, screw it.  I'm off.  Dude, in moments like that, it's tempting.  You're just trying to have that moment of clarity alone in your head where you can all make sense of it and then get to what you do.  But when you say, that's why you're asking questions.  We all do that as comedians.  It's a stall tactic.  Yeah.  What do you do for a living?  And they tell you, oh, you do that as you're repeating it.  You're thinking.  It's all trying to get your head together.  And all right, now I can straighten this out.  And he just couldn't because there was too many and they were yelling and he was a little bit, you know, taken back by it. 
[02:40:30]  But you don't ask him to repeat the hateful things.  No, that is something that is.  Get off.  What?  What?  Get off.  I thought that's what you said, but I wanted to clarify.  I didn't want to misquote you, sir.  When you hear certain single guys, single people, not the whole group, yelling out these heckles.  When he said, I could be the funniest guy and you still wouldn't laugh.  Someone just yelled, you're not.  And you're not.  He was giving them every opportunity to hammer him. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  Like, yeah, but if I suck, you'd all yell, you suck.  Yeah.  You do.  You suck.  That's what they were yelling.  Did we blow off the a-hole chant?  No.  Part two?  Okay.  Oh, that's in when he returns to the stage.  So now Vos comes back to the stage, it looks like here.  Part of the riot.  They're all applauding now because Billy has finally decided to leave the stage. 
[02:41:30]  That's what you're hearing here.  And then, you know, Vos is making his way back.  And I think Vos is looking behind him because he's never heard applause walking out before.  I think Vos is making his way back.  I think Vos is making his way back.  I think Vos is making his way back.  I think Vos is making his way back.  Wow.  Billy Staples.  You wouldn't think you'd be so happy to see Rich Vos again that quick, huh?  This just turned from the Red Bank Theater to the white Apollo.  Now he's getting some good laugh. 
[02:42:00]  That's funny.  That's funny.  Sure.  The Apollo?  Sure.  It's like following Mussolini in World War II.  Of course they're going to love you.  Anybody could have come out there.  Yeah.  Unbelievable.  Billy, you don't want to just try a few more?  Now, Vos is an ass right here.  He loved it a little too much.  He was enjoying it.  He thought, I want more.  Bring him back out.  And he talks him back out on stage. 
[02:42:30]  Just making him believe he cares.  He wanted to see Billy eat it just a little more.  Do two more.  F*** them.  He's going to do two.  All right.  So now, here comes Billy.  Billy decides to come back onto the stage.  You got to lose.  I've just been told they got to do another 20 minutes.  Look how quickly.  Let me ask the ladies a question here tonight. 
[02:43:00]  Ladies, I want to ask you a question.  And I want you to answer it as honestly and quickly as you can.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Ladies.  Does size matter?  Oh, holy s***.  We got a lot of sluts here tonight.  See, it took a little long.  What's that mean?  Yeah.  What's that mean?  18 seconds or 20 seconds.  When you go back out like that, audiences, as rotten as they can be, want to have a good time. 
[02:43:30]  But they would have.  But you just got to hit them, man.  You can't pause.  Yeah.  He stopped.  Ladies.  How many?  Another question for the audience.  Are you ready to laugh?  Yeah.  Another question.  I mean, when you have your second shot like that and walk out, now you've had time to reflect.  You take your atomic bomb out there.  You take the biggest weapon in your arsenal and hit them right between the eyes. 
[02:44:00]  Yep.  Not another question for the audience.  And then they call all the women sluts.  Right.  And now he's alienated.  I really didn't hear too many women's voices during those heckles.  But now he's brought them on board.  I do take.  Hey, anybody doesn't think size matter?  Girls.  We're right.  You guys s*** don't get it.  You guys just don't f***ing get it.  I'm talking size. 
[02:44:30]  You guys ain't giving me a f***ing chance, are you?  F***ing chance.  So what?  No f***ing tomatoes?  No, no.  Where are you pussies?  All this thing.  What?  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  You've been so kind.  And there he goes.  And that's when he walked off for the second time. 
[02:45:00]  Now that A-hole chant, I don't know if they let it through.  Maybe they let some of it through.  That went on for a really long time.  We had to cut that down a little bit there.  And then he was just standing there as they were chanting.  And then he said, F you.  And I think he gave the crowd the finger and all that too as he was walking off.  Yeah, something like that.  But there's still a little more on there.  You hear an exchange between him and Rich.  Okay.  Oh.  I didn't know these animals were going to do this.  Billy Staples walking off like a pumpkin.  Billy Staples. 
[02:45:30]  He's a good friend.  And you know what?  That's going to be a long drive home to Long Island.  Foss really is a mean spirit.  Did you hear him?  He thought no one was listening.  What did he say?  Because he kind of pulled the mic aside.  And he goes, I don't know if these animals were going to do this.  He didn't pull the mic aside.  He's too stupid to understand.  He's like, well, I want it to be a secret.  So it will be.  Foss would cover his eyes with his little midget Jewish hands and go, no one can see me.  Rich, you're a dummy. 
[02:46:00]  These animals.  Do those thoughts cohabit?  You moaks.  And, Norton, you really want him to go back up again.  You know what?  I don't do that to mess with people.  I like Billy, man.  And if he wants to work Long Island with me, he's welcome to.  I don't even want him to own cable anymore.  I don't want him to even see comedy.  I'm concerned about him.  That's the stop.  What Billy's got to realize is that's the fear.  People's greatest fear in life is public speaking.  And almost 99.99% of the public could never take what he took and then get back up again. 
[02:46:30]  That's what's going to make you different.  You're a comic, man.  You took it in the face.  Be a trooper.  Get back up.  That's it.  Get back up.  Never let them beat you.  Ever.  You know, he sounded like a broken, defeated man on your show last night, Ron.  Yeah, it was awful.  Yeah, it was.  It was depressing to listen to.  I was like, I so wanted to call up and just say, Patton should slap your fat face.  Well, I think a lot of that is just the pills.  You think it's the pills?  It's the pills, but probably. 
[02:47:00]  Where do they wear off?  And he just feels the full burn.  And what's he doing in Pennsylvania?  Yellow belly.  That's as far as he could drive.  Is that it?  Yeah.  I mean, you have to, you know, he rented a car that he hasn't returned, but you still  have to buy gas.  So he got as far as Amish country and he's just sitting there with a brown paper bag drinking  out of it.  Yeah.  Taking the last of his pills.  All right, Ronnie.  Thank you so much.  All right.  See you guys in a little bit. 
[02:47:30]  We're going to leave this tape for you because I'm sure you'll have a lot more to add to  this when you're hanging with Fezzy later tonight here in New York.  We're going to dupe it and sell copies.  There you go.  Hey, see you guys.  You're the best.  Thank you, Ron.  All right, my friends.  All right.  There he goes, Ron from Ron and Fez.  Ron.  On right after us here in New York City.  And we're going to hand the tape over to them.  Yeah.  We'll give them the tape.  And I want them to have the joy of watching it because it was indeed a videotape.  It can't be posted, though.  Unfortunately.  No.  For commercial reasons, I get sued. 
[02:48:00]  You can't post it.  But I want to sit there and watch Ron and Fez watch that tape.  That's what I want to do.  Because it's brutal to watch him.  He's sweating.  He's twitching.  His hands are shaking.  I haven't seen it.  Oh, it's great.  It's really.  No.  It's not great.  No, it's great to watch.  It's brutal.  It makes me realize I have a heart because he walks out.  He's so happy to be there.  He's excited.  It's his big gig with Norton.  You could tell he got the special shirt.  You could tell he looked in the mirror and said, man, I know I look good in this shirt. 
[02:48:30]  I know I'm not the most attractive person.  This is the gig.  But this is it.  I know I look good in orange.  It was brand new.  It was pressed.  He comes out with that smile and puts one hand on the mic stand.  And he's got the mic and he's ready to go.  It meant something to him.  It so meant something to him.  Seriously.  Next thing you know, you can just see his dream just crashing and burning in front of  his eyes.  But dude, I think, I'm not even plugging him.  If he wants to do Long Island with me, what I do, and I'm not goofing, I wouldn't do that 
[02:49:00]  to another act.  I'm more than welcome to have him.  I like Billy.  Just go up all week, you know, get your stuff in order.  Because I think he's got funny stuff, but it just wasn't because it threw him a little  bit.  It's like sometimes you can have an hour of material and you can't find any in your head  because you're so like, all right, what do I do, what do I do?  He should come out like Farley.  He should come out, get him laughing with the, hey, you know, down by the river.  Because he looks like him.  And then while they're laughing at that, you take the glasses off and you start doing your  act.  Because I tell you.  Kind of an attention getter. 
[02:49:30]  I told you guys, I got booed like that in Chicago working with Dice.  And this was 14 people, 100 in Red Bank.  I got 4,800 booing me.  And I couldn't hear myself deliver my first joke, which I knew would kill in Chicago.  They didn't know me.  So I'm bombing and I'm thinking, well, you're a dead man.  And this was in the McGuire social race.  And I just snapped.  I started insulting them and telling them Chicago stinks.  I hope McGuire wins because I was going to bomb.  I'm going to let them know how I feel.  Right.  And then somebody heckled me.  And you can see when somebody heckles, they actually will stop for a second and let you. 
[02:50:00]  And I got lucky.  I hammered him.  Somebody else heckled.  I hammered him.  And the crowd laughed both times.  Now you got him a little bit coming back.  They both, they laughed really big.  And then there was that one moment.  Remember, they had that one moment Billy had.  I had that one moment.  And the only difference between my set and his set was my joke did well.  And he made a different choice.  That's all it was.  He had that moment.  So I wound up having actually a very good set.  But it could have went the other way.  God, I just babbled.  Sorry.  It's all good.  We're going to take a break, Anthony.  Good news.  Another person that's not scared to be on our show today is going to be on next. 
[02:50:30]  Pat Croce.  Oh, nice.  We got to talk about that slam ball we were checking out.  Yeah, very cool.  Oh, my God.  The best move I've ever seen in basketball was made that night.  Oh, cool.  Very cool.  They're using trampolines.  All right, don't yell at me.  I'm just saying I enjoyed it.  It's a lot like porno.  Only without all the sophisticated dialogue.  Oh, yeah.

But we never realized that to some customers, it's a different kind of card entirely.  To me, the Plus Card is a greeting card.  Because when I carry it, I can say hello to savings in every aisle.  It's a trump card because it always trumps the regular price.  It's a flash card because the shelf text tells me in a flash how much cash I'm saving.  It's a get well card because I've had a healthier food budget ever since I started using it.

[02:58:00]  Everyone's got to have a plan.  Mine's pretty simple, cost me about a buck a week.  Whatever I can scrape together.  I save up all my change and then go find a copier.  Yeah, but it works better when I go with him.  You know, act as lookout.  Yeah, I definitely don't want to do this solo.  No way.  So I go find a copier, stick my money in,  then I hop up really quick and sit on the copier.  He's gone pretty fast.  Why, thank you.  We make one copy and I write on it. 
[02:58:30]  Then we copy as many as we can for a buck or two.  Then we hang them wherever there's lots of people.  They come up, looking, trying to figure out what it is.  Then they read it.  Oh, remember that one copy?  Oh, yeah.  I don't like seeing your butts either.  Find a garbage can.  Or better yet, don't smoke.  It takes them a second, but I think they get our point.  That's my idea.  Now, how are you going to take a stand against tobacco?  Want some ideas?  Go to standonline.org to stand up and speak out against tobacco.

Well, I heard they jacked up their circulation and they're putting stacks of papers in more places every Thursday.  But it's never there on the weekend when I look for it.  There's a reason for that.  There is?  Yeah.  Turns out Thursday doesn't fall on a weekend.  Everybody else is grabbing a copy on Thursday.  By the time you look for it, it's gone.  Oh, so then what do I do?  Well, you can go to their website, theotherpaper.com.

Grab a brush and put a little makeup. 
[03:09:30]  You wanted to.  I just got the baby with the shakeup.  You wanted to.  Why'd you leave the keys up on the table?  You wanted to.  I don't think it's up.  In my self-righteous suicide, I cry.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Man, that rocks.  I love this.  I put down.  Today's word of the day is... 
[03:10:00]  Deja vu.  Boujade.  Boujade.  There is not breaking news.  Deja vu.  What, Jim Norton?  Breaking news.  Uh-oh.  Heather Mills has just kicked off a leg during rocket...  I think...  Oh!  Damn it!  I saw where you were going with that.  God, is that funny.  Oh!  Rockette.  Oh, I suck.  You stink.  Heather Mills has just kicked off a leg in the middle of Rockette's audition. 
[03:10:30]  I screwed it up.  You suck.  We needed that one today.  That's not a bad line.  That's funny.  I like the visual of her.  I like the visual.  Her leg flying off as she's humiliated as the other girls have, too.  All of them with their arms around each other.  Da-da-da.  One goes flying.  One little red Christmas boot on it.  We got an old friend on the hotline. 
[03:11:00]  It's a llama in the ass on stage.  Oh, I'd pay to see that.  Let's say hi to Pat Croce.  Yo, Opie.  Hello, Anthony.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey, you take care of my buddy Jimmy there?  Hello.  Hello, Pat.  You have no problem being on this show today, sir?  No problem whatsoever.  Thank you, sir.  You got my full support.  Thank you.  Thank you, Pat.  We need it.  I hear.  Now, Opie, turn me on to this sport.  This sport that you got going. 
[03:11:30]  Slam ball.  Anthony, even you can dunk in this sport.  This is unbelievable.  It looks like...  Talk about watching a show where you believe somebody is going to die during the course of the program.  It's bad.  Why don't you explain it?  Because you could probably do it a lot better than I can.  A slam ball.  Think of an NBA regulation court.  94 feet, but this entire court is spring-loaded, so the whole thing gives to a degree.  The entire glass and board's up from hockey, so the ball is always in play. 
[03:12:00]  And inlaid inside the court, inside the three-point arc, at both ends of the court, are these four competition-sized trampolines, strategically placed.  So when the players come down, it's four on four.  They come down, they dribble, and as soon as they hit the tramps, they are the dribble, and they just take off.  And they all look like Michael Jordan, doing all kinds of outrageous maneuvers in the air, extreme.  And the beautiful thing about it, guys, is that the defender can take them out. 
[03:12:30]  It's full contact.  Yeah, that's the part that I was like, oh my God, I can't believe what they're doing.  A defender will time it and hit the trampoline the same time the guy with the ball does.  They hit each other.  It looks like something out of a John Woo film.  Yeah.  They're like smacking each other 20 feet in the air.  Yeah, the one guy is like a goalie in hockey, really.  Yeah, right.  He's called the stopper.  And what he does is it's four on four, and it's only a 15-second shot clock.  So the game is really fast, high action, high impact, high flying.  And that stopper's mentality is stop whatever and however he can. 
[03:13:00]  And we have a couple of these guys.  They're most from inner city L.A. and inner city Chicago.  But a couple of them are football players.  All right.  So they got that.  You're being kind, Pat.  Your people sent the tape.  It looked like you guys were playing in a penitentiary.  It looked like the Bloods versus the Crips.  I didn't know where they were from.  These guys, I got it.  I got it.  No, they did look like a penitentiary.  But I got it.  But I got it, you ass.  And I saw you, and I knew you were hoping.  But you know what?  I made it.  No, you're right. 
[03:13:30]  After two hours sleep in the hell we've been through today, that is bad.  I made it.  You're right.  It was like a river run through.  Sorry, Pat.  Shut up.  But, Pat, we took a peek at the tape.  It's unbelievable.  It really is.  You've been talking about slam ball for a while.  Last time we were in Philly, you were like, hey, this is something I'm working on.  And I've got to be honest.  I'm like, I'm a huge basketball fan.  And I'm like, yeah, okay, I'll take a peek.  I was kind of interested.  But after actually seeing a game with the gang in the back office, this is unbelievable.  Well, Opie, and I'm a big NBA fan. 
[03:14:00]  This doesn't take the place of NBA.  I can't wait until it kicks up in October and November.  But this is just fun.  It's probably the first extreme team sport.  It's played on TNN, the new TNN, every Saturday at 8 o'clock.  And then for those who like to party and come back home around midnight, there's a re-telecast of it.  And the first two weeks have had great ratings, great response.  You know, it's something different.  That little bastard.  Who the hell was that guy?  That's what I was going to ask him.  Who was that guy?  God, I couldn't tell you the team or anything. 
[03:14:30]  He hit that trampoline.  He takes the ball.  It went under his leg to the other hand where he then hooked it over his head, doing a 360, and slammed that thing.  You know who he is.  His nickname is Inches.  They call him Sean Jackson.  But he's in the Nike commercials that does all that freestyling with the basketball to music.  Oh, okay.  He's unbelievable.  He's our Allen Iverson of slam ball.  He looked like he was 17 feet off the ground.  He probably is. 
[03:15:00]  These guys get way over the rip.  There's one guy that gets his armpit over top of the backboard.  So you're talking, he can get up there as 20 feet.  And I like the names of the teams.  We were watching a game, I think it was the Mobs versus the Crips.  The Steel, or it could be Diablos.  Diablos.  Oh, yeah, Diablos.  I thought, yeah, that's one of the gangs in Grand Theft Auto 3.  And it does.  It just looks like gang warfare happening. 
[03:15:30]  And the goal is hopefully that it gets a great response and we kick it up again next year.  We look like we get a tour out there because we want tryouts.  We want 600 players tried out for these 48 spots.  It's eight players on a team.  Four only play at a time.  Only six teams.  And we want to kick it up to another degree of athleticism and that element of fear.  And hopefully in the year 2004, maybe we have a slam ball court in all those twin rinks all over the city.  Yeah, it looks really exciting.  You know, I can't wait for the video game. 
[03:16:00]  It's obvious that someone's going to make a video game of this.  It's perfect.  It truly is a human video game.  We're just watching it.  Right.  And it's perfect for your audience because they're half nuts.  I didn't think I would like it and I wound up loving it.  I'm like, I'm not going to like this.  And I think after I saw that guy make that move, I could not stop watching it.  Jimmy, I can't see how you, and if you saw it in person, you'd really be impressed.  Because these guys whack it.  There's no script involved.  These guys are some tough nuts.  It was violent.  It was, I really enjoyed it, man.  And I didn't expect to.  I really liked it.  Cool.  Talk about being a little frightened. 
[03:16:30]  I don't know.  Where do they tape that?  We did it in L.A.  I wouldn't want to, to tell you the truth, I don't think I want to see one live there, Pat.  I'm telling you, you would like it.  I don't think I'd fit in with the crowd that I saw sitting for the first game I saw.  You know, it was like a John Singleton film.  Yeah, it really did.  Hey, Pat, you need a couple guys to do the pregame show or what?  Hey, man, we'd love to have you.  The death mill.  Hey, listen, when we do, take up, when we kick it up to the next notch, I'll call you  back, Ope.  I would love to have you and Anthony do that. 
[03:17:00]  I would do that in a second, because I just love hoops, but.  Yeah, well, we'll see.  We'll see if we need a job.  Hey, Pat, you doing anything else, like jumping off buildings or anything?  No, I'm chilling right now down this shore, chilling right now.  What NBA team are you going to be working for next year?  None right now.  None right now.  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.  We need to get a scoop from you.  Nah, no scoop.  There's no scoop available, bro.  You're going to be doing the TV again?  No, NBA is now on ABC 15 of the games, so the 35 games left the NBC. 
[03:17:30]  The rest are picked up by ESPN, TNT, and TBS.  So there'll be plenty of games on, but most of them will be on cable.  Oh, man, they need you, though.  You did a great job last year.  Well, there might be some opportunities when NBA and AOL joins forces, and they create this  new NBA TV.  So who knows?  But thanks, Oop.  Okay.  And remember, I still, remember, you still got to go to a game with me.  Um, I know.  I blew my chance. 
[03:18:00]  I gave you a couple good opportunities.  I know.  I know.  We had something going on.  We had to go to New Orleans.  Somewhere.  You could have met Jordan.  No, you know what you want?  You went to Boston.  You went somewhere north, I guess, when...  I had the chance to meet Jordan, and I blew it.  Yeah.  I blew it.  The guy offered you...  No, there was...  Well, that one...  You wanted Jordan.  You wanted the Wizards and Sixers.  I got your court side.  Then you wanted the finals.  Lakers versus...  It was the Nets.  And I got you that.  And then all of us...  You guys went to...  You went to Boston.  You went somewhere north to do a remote. 
[03:18:30]  Yeah, exactly.  Ah.  You should be throwing up in a penitentiary for that.  Oh!  I got it out, though, man.  I really got...  It's been a long 24 hours.  You got to give me that one.  He got you the tickets, though.  Yeah, I know he did.  All right, Pat.  The big plug, please.  The big plug?  Yeah, for...  Flamble.  Saturday nights, 8 o'clock, on the new TNN.  Check it out.  All right.  Thank you, Pat.  See you, Anthony.  See you, Jimmy.  Bye, Mr. Croce.  See you, guys.  We'll talk to you soon.  You got it.  All right.  Talk about somebody who's out of his mind.  He's amazing. 
[03:19:00]  That guy.  He's a great guy.  Yeah, he is.  He's full of energy.  There's a guy that forgave us.  Jim.  Oh, that's right.  Jim.  Jim made a really big full paw when we first saw it.  And don't even repeat it.  I'm not going to.  I don't want Mr. Croce to get mad again.  I'm not going to, but I forgot about that.  As mad as he got the Philly list, he loved it, because they're like, hey, all right.  That was where I got certain information from.  But it's all water under the bridge we made up.  And I'm glad he gave me, because he's a black belt and a maniac.  He could kick your ass.  He really could savagely beat me.  Yeah.  He looks like the type of guy that could just throw a savage beating. 
[03:19:30]  He was joking around at me when we went to Philly for the first time.  He goes, oh, hey, is this Norton?  And he threw like a karate move next to my head.  And I didn't think he was going to hit me.  But I realized this man could savagely.  He could take my clothes off and just slap my fat body.  And I would nothing but y'all quit it.  His bitch slap you.  Yeah.  As a goof.  Like a little chubby gal.  I stink.  Anthony, what's going on?  What's up, all my names?  I'm Norton.  How you guys doing?  Hello, sir.  Thanks for calling.  Oh, you're welcome, sir.  Hey, can I make an observation, Anthony?  Sure.  Just throw these things in from time to time. 
[03:20:00]  Uh-huh.  I think we lost our whole listening audience today to TV.  You think so?  Yeah.  What's up, Anthony?  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I thought I got to play about three weeks ago.  Two weeks ago?  I can't.  Your phone.  You've got to have the worst phone ever.  You can't hear me?  Are you talking into a football?  Yeah, now it's better.  Now you can hear me?  Yeah.  I was going to say, the coolest thing about that game is when the guys, they take a three-pointer,  when they bounce to the backboard, and the guy just comes sailing out of nowhere to take it and just dunk it. 
[03:20:30]  These guys, they have 15, 20 feet in the air going at least like 15, 20 miles an hour.  And they slam into each other.  They're insane.  Head to goal.  Clam ball.  Banging heads, man.  I bet you after that game, every one of them needs penicillin.  Wait a minute, guys.  Why are you doing this to me?  You know I got it up, because I looked at you when I was panicking.  I know.  I'm kidding.  I feel bad for Billy.  I'm panicking.  I feel bad for Billy.  The poor guy, at least you do good. 
[03:21:00]  He bombs.  He has to go to Pennsylvania.  I was panicking, but you know I made it through.  Hey, Ben, can you give me a pen?  You know why you're doing this?  Because of his Heather Mills flub.  I thought I was flub.  That was a good joke.  People are not going to forget the Heather Mills thing.  All right?  As much as you could, you know, you want to pound me for my little faux pas.  I really got it then.  Yeah, dude.  That was a good joke, and I totally tripped on it.  As it was coming out, I knew I screwed.  I should have rehearsed it once in the mirror, like I do with a ruler. 
[03:21:30]  You have made everyone paranoid in this stupid studio, though.  But, dude, I'm the first one to acknowledge if I have like a little, don't forget the apostrophe, flub.  I've been flubbing for years, and it's never mattered until you came into our stupid lives.  And it's worked.  Dude, Voss lives a flub.  Now, every time I know I'm flubbing, I have to look at you.  I'm going to laugh at you.  See, Anthony's going to let me slide.  He'll let me slide.  Never mind.  I let him slide all the time.  But there you.  You get all excited.  You really do.  You're such a creep. 
[03:22:00]  Because you're mean-spirited, and you throw little balls of paper at me, and no one sees that.  They think, oh, I bet he's tuffling little Jimmy's hair right now.  But you're not.  You're throwing things, and you're mean.  I even don't see that.  I used to throw razor blades.  Ask Ed.  I'm glad you don't throw razor blades.  I used to.  On the old tape-cutting days.  Yeah, it's really antisocial.  All right.  Vinny, what's going on?  Vin?  Oh.  Vin, Vin, you're on open air.  Hi, Vin.  Hey, Vinny.  Oh.  What's up, Vinny? 
[03:22:30]  Yo, I just want to say that show is awesome.  Yeah, you like that?  Yeah.  I was watching it the other night.  I seen that guy do a 360 under his leg.  I almost asked myself.  That was great, right?  Oh.  He's, uh...  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  He's great.  Oh.  Oh, my God.  We're starting to...  That took forever.  We're starting to sweat, because that's all that's coming in on the phones.  What?  People talking about slam ball.  Dude, what else are you going to talk about?  Are you going to talk about October 26th and the Cleveland?  Who cares? 
[03:23:00]  There's no one stupid Civic Liquid Auditorium.  Nobody cares.  Shameless.  I'm not shameless.  I'm not discussing that.  Oh, no.  Oh, God.  We'd have just...  We'd have...  We'd have...  Oh, we'd have cleared the finish line by leaps and bounds if we were able to discuss certain  things today.  It's been just this...  This clawing and trying to not talk about things.  You feel like...  The people that hung with us today, Anthony...  Yeah.  Just to give you an idea, we would have just started talking about the baseball strike right 
[03:23:30]  now.  Right.  Right now.  But, you know, we did that two and a half hours ago.  Oh, it would have been insane.  But right about now, we would have added other things to the program.  Could have potted up the old television.  All fun stuff like that.  But now...  It's all this pen cup frustration.  Frustration.  Oh, God.  Just threw the stapler at little Jimmy.  Well...  You okay?  Yeah. 
[03:24:00]  I'm used to seeing staples just hit the floor.  Oh, now we can all laugh together.  Yeah.  Poor Billy.  Boy, we're going to need a bit or something because we're dying.  How are you...  Clean Cazine?  Notice Voss has just avoided us like the plate.  You know what I mean?  Oh, yeah.  He's...  This cut hurt my career.  Oh, yeah.  He's blubbering through something haphazardly. 
[03:24:30]  Trying to...  Just trying to look for the words.  What did he say yesterday?  It was so awful.  Oh, uh...  Con...  Con...  Cohabit.  Cohabit.  Did that cohabit?  Did the scores cohabit?  Yeah.  Cohabit?  You're going to get lamb bashed.  Yeah, we, um...  Wow.  We're in, uh...  We're in a jam now.  No, he'll throw something.  We're in a jam.  No, I won't throw anything. 
[03:25:00]  You will.  How are you, uh...  How are you leaving?  No, I won't.  What?  How are you leaving?  I see a couple nice couches around here.  Are you going to hang out for a little bit?  It's very difficult to, uh...  Leave the building.  What can I throw him?  Yeah?  What's your business?  Uh, do you have a...  Uh, uh...  No, I don't.  Mind your goddamn business.  Yeah.  Just slap him.  All I'm going to say to them,  Westbury 7th, Long Island.  Ooh.  Westbury 7th.  Westbury 7th.  Westbury 7th.  Hmm.  Westbury. 
[03:25:30]  Westbury 7th.  7th.  Yeah.  You meant to say September 7th.  At Westbury.  Yeah, that's called the old quick plug.  The old quick plug.  Lakewood 26th in October.  That's called...  I'm out of the barrel and you're in.  Oh.  But I didn't...  It was one of those little flubs.  I didn't know one of the months was called Westbury.  Yes.  Last check in.  Were you talking about me?  Hey.  Hi, Rich.  Hey, I'm not avoiding you guys.  Hi, Angel.  Hey, Cookie Puss.  I, uh...  I was playing golf today. 
[03:26:00]  38-44.  Uh, you know.  Hey, you know what?  Now I really feel bad about that whole Billy thing.  Why?  I don't know.  You loved it and you dragged him back out on stage.  Yeah.  No, you know what?  I didn't drag him back out.  I didn't twist his arm.  I figured, you know what?  Maybe if he came back out this time, they would listen.  He regrouped a little.  Oh, you've been in the business long enough to know that wasn't going to happen.  You didn't think that.  No, you didn't.  You were enjoying the show so much that you had to get him back out there. 
[03:26:30]  I know I led them into the room.  I thought there were showers.  How was I supposed to know?  You knew what was happening, you awful man.  Listen, here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Comics love...  If you don't know the comic, it doesn't matter.  But if it's a friend of yours and they're tanking it...  You're right, dude.  There is nothing more funny.  Because you watch them try to get out of it.  You're watching them sweat.  It's hilarious.  I mean, if it's someone you don't know, you don't care.  You just go, oh, he stinks.  You know, we know.  Billy's worked with me before.  He's done well.  You know. 
[03:27:00]  It was just funny once in a while.  I watched you bomb once for 45 minutes in Connecticut.  I watched...  And I mean nothing.  And I've never giggled harder.  It was hilarious.  Smoking with a ponytail.  Just getting nothing.  From people who wanted to have fun.  Yeah.  Yeah, so...  You know what I...  One of my favorite...  One of my favorite bombings was watching Jimmy bomb in front of like 10 people at Dangerfield.  Dude, you actually saw that.  I wish I had a tape of that.  I bomb constantly, dude, doing gigs like that.  No, no. 
[03:27:30]  I know.  But then you decided to start doing Voss' material as Voss.  And you were getting big laughs.  And I was with Voss.  And Voss was getting so pissed.  I want to get out of it.  Yes, you were again.  And then you stood up and was screaming and yelling, hey, that's my material.  And no one believed you.  Get out of here.  Did I do that?  I wish I had a tape of that.  Because he was doing the whole Voss delivery with the...  Voss' material was killing you.  With the exaggerated faces and all.  Showed you the type of crowd they were.  They like it very lowbrow, apparently.  And then Jim goes, okay, enough of that. 
[03:28:00]  And it goes back to his material.  And it was one of those nights for Jimmy.  He'll admit it, right?  Yes.  Nothing.  Nothing.  So Olsen Voss stands up and goes, how about you do more of my jokes?  Do more of my acts?  So he does it even more exaggerated and getting big laughs.  I must confess.  Well, listen.  Here's the deal.  You guys have nothing today and neither do I.  So I'm not going to stay on.  Don't try to bond.  Creep.  We had some good stuff today.  Rob, what's up? 
[03:28:30]  Which is hurtful.  Hey.  I'll tell you what.  You know what this show is like today?  Here's what it's like.  This show's like a rain delay or when you go to a ball game.  It's like an extra inning game.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden there's no beer.  Ten o'clock.  And now it's one o'clock in the morning.  And the announcer says, hey, guess what?  You get free tickets to another bad show.  I'm out of here, precious.  We're going to have a doubleheader, though, Monday.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah.  It's just a matter of when we came in here today, we had an entire show planned.  We had sound clips. 
[03:29:00]  We had stories.  We had phone calls.  We had things that were printed out to read.  Look at this.  I'm looking at it right now.  We were going to do an interview with the U.K. today.  Right.  We had an entire fun-filled show planned for you today.  Today's a rain delay, but Monday it'll be a doubleheader, and it's also bat day.  I like the baseball analogies, because right now we are in a pennant race.  Dude, you messed up twice and messed up once.  And at exactly 2.40, we were told what we could or could not speak of, and everything went out the window. 
[03:29:30]  And I was like, well, but that's been on my mind.  And you're right, I really would like to chat about it.  And you're right, they did tell us.  Yeah.  You're right.  Yeah.  And this time, we decided to listen.  Well, you know how things go.  It's better that way sometimes.  The lawyers say they know best, and, you know. 
[03:30:00]  Hey, Paul.  Hey.  What's up, Paul?  I'm still diagramming Rob's analogy.  That was a little complicated for me.  It's a good show today.  Oh, thanks.  I was just calling in to, uh...  Hey, and you had a good show yesterday.  Thank you.  It's nice to see the sun, huh?  I had a segment I wanted to talk about how to prepare your soil for planting your bulbs for fall season. 
[03:30:30]  Oh, that's exciting.  That could fill a little time.  Yeah.  I think it's a fine show.  Hey, uh, Paul, I think we're going to do this on another date.  Yeah.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Get those T-shirts made.  Yeah.  Can't wait for the latest T-shirt.  I'm reading a new, uh...  I'm reading, uh, something else on the web. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  I haven't seen, uh...  I haven't seen this yet.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Uh-oh.  Hmm.  What?  I don't know.  Something else, um...  Oh, look at that.  Ken Stevens.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Uh...  That.  And then...  Oh.  We don't know.  I want to know who...  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  Hmm?  That's a funny statement.  I wish I could read it. 
[03:31:30]  It's very funny.  It's on newsday.com.  Hmm?  It's, uh...  Uh...  Whoa.  Hey.  Uh...  Remember that thing?  Do you remember?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, boy.  Look at who wrote it.  Who?  So that goes...  Oh!  Oh!  Oh!  Which means it has to be true.  Oh, yeah.  That's a true...  That's a true statement, then. 
[03:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  That's not your, um...  Your local guy.  Mm-hmm.  See, it's just odd to not be able to talk about that.  It wasn't a regular feature.  Um...  All right.  Wow.  Okay.  Hey.  See?  We're going to break, Anthony.  Yeah.  Let's see if we can't, uh, dig something up.  And, uh...  And, uh...  And, uh, get through.  Make it to the end.  Stop blowing on my arm, you tool. 
[03:32:30]  Goddamn Norton.  And I sit there going, he's going to stop it.  For some reason, he must have to blow on my arm right now.  But he'll stop in a second.  Well, you know what you do is you breathe next to somebody through your nose.  Just those two little jets...  Two little jets of air.  Two little jets of cooled air blowing on the arm of another man.  That is horrible.  You're the worst.  Gently.  Gently.  Know how many times I hear in the back office, stop that?  I'll be doing something, so I'm not looking at you.  And someone else in the office will just yell, stop that. 
[03:33:00]  Stop that.  Or don't touch me.  Stop touching me.  The little gentle touches on the back of the neck.  He'll grab you under your forearm like you would grab a girl you're in love with.  Very gently.  And go, yeah, that thing was great.  And then you go, oh, okay.  And then he won't remove his hand.  He'll just stand there all uncomfortable.  And you've got to say, stop touching me.  Yeah, all right.  Just gently touch.  Well, you place what really creeps guys out.  I get goffy with this all the time.  I place my three fingertips, not my thumb or my pinky, on his forearm very lightly when 
[03:33:30]  I'm talking.  And I'm like, my hands clean.  I'm like, dude, what time are we going to go down there?  And it just really creeps him out.  It is creepy.  It's just a gentle, gentle little touch.  Just in case you're keeping track at home, Anthony.  Yeah.  O&A, it's a clean sweep for you in New York City.

Yeah, last month when Mitsubishi Motors started offering its Never Pay Interest deal, where you can buy a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi and never pay interest and make no payments for a year, a lot of other nevers happen too.  First off, we never thought never paying interest would be so popular.  We also never thought we'd sell so many cars in a single month.  But mostly, we never thought we'd get close to selling all our award-winning 2002 Mitsubishis.  The Eclipse, the Montero Sport, the Lancer, even the Gallant, the fastest-growing Japanese sedan in its class. 
[03:40:00]  But they're going fast.  And when they're gone, so is the deal, which, let's face it, you never like to hear.  So if you want to buy a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi and you want to never pay interest and make no payments for a year, you may never get a chance like this again.  So hurry, because never won't last forever.  Head to Mitsubishi Motors right now and never pay interest for the length of your loan and pay nothing for a year on a brand new 2002 Mitsubishi.  Hurry, when they're gone, so is the deal.  Important program and credit restrictions apply.  Apply new 2002 models and new 2003 Eclipse.  Go call and exclude 2003 Eclipse spiders.

[03:42:30]  Everyone's got to have a plan.  Mine's pretty simple.  Cost me about a buck a week.  Whenever I can scrape together.  I save up all my change and then go find a copier.  Yeah, but it works better when I go with him.  You know, act his lookout.  Yeah, I definitely don't want to do this solo.  No way.  So I go find a copier, stick my money in, then I hop up really quick and sit on the copier.  He's gone pretty fast.  Why, thank you.  We make one copy and I write on it.  Then we copy as many as we can for a buck or two. 
[03:43:00]  Then we hang them wherever there's lots of people.  They come up looking, trying to figure out what it is.  Then they read it.  Oh, remember that one copy?  Oh, yeah.  I don't like seeing your butts either.  Find a garbage can.  Or better yet, don't smoke.  It takes them a second.  But I think they get our point.  That's my idea.

[03:44:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony show. 
[03:44:30]  Let's get right into what did we learn today.  Let's see how clever the audience could get today, Anthony.  Troy, what's going on, man?  What's up, man?  Hey, I understand you guys have had a really rough 24 hours.  Listen, I just wanted to, Opie, I wanted to offer you a penny for your thoughts.  Hope to see you in Sacramento soon, Dolly Dimples.  I'm working on a date right now, Angel. 
[03:45:00]  Dolly Dimples?  What?  That's horrible.  That's another man.  What?  Isaac, what's up?  Yo, what's up, guys?  What's up?  Today, I learned how to make a buffalo zucchini seem insignificant.  Oh, wow.  God, that is good.  Hey, he gave himself a...  Thanks, guys.  Hello.  Peace.  Let's go to Ebony and Ivory.  Ebony.  Hi, guys.  Howdy.  Hey, hey.  Hello, turn of cheeks. 
[03:45:30]  Oh.  Oh, God.  I learned three things today.  Yeah.  I learned Gary from weird science has a stomach flu.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Gary from weird science, yeah.  I learned Grey Goose and Coke are awful together, but it takes the edge off.  Right.  And Billy got heckled at the White Apollo.  Nice.  The White Apollo.  Later, guys.  Bye, Ebony.  Love you.  Holla, much, you.  The White Apollo.  Love you, Ebony.  Love you, Francine.  Thank you, Ebony.  Hey, hey, hey, hey.  Hey, Charlie from Rockland County.  I learned today nothing. 
[03:46:00]  I was too busy scanning the TV looking for details.  Right.  Go to the busy phones.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I learned it's probably not a good idea to ask a bunch of 20-year-olds if they've had a colonoscopy.  Yeah, we learned that today, huh?  And I learned.  Anybody have a colonoscopy?  And I learned penitentiary should be in the next owner's spelling bee.  Oh.  Oh. 
[03:46:30]  Later.  Thank you, Uncle John.  You know, we could have bailed today, man.  You should have.  Shut up.  Shut up, Steve.  Sorry, Ope.  That's hilarious.  I'll give it to you.  See?  We were given the option.  You guys could go in there and struggle, or you could just bail and put on some more  of that old best of crap.  Believe me, Ope.  We struggled with you.  All right, cool.  What's up, Steve?  Today, I learned that Opey don't know nothing.  Yes.  And that's all I got, because I'm feeling kind of pen-sip. 
[03:47:00]  Later.  See you, man.  That's not fair.  Oh, that is very funny.  You outflubbed me today.  Screw fair.  That's funny.  And I got screwed.  Yeah.  Westbury 7th?  Yeah.  It doesn't even matter.  It doesn't matter.  He's part of the Westbury 7th.  Yeah, Lakewood 26th.  We could do it all the plugs.  Yeah.  Damn Cleveland.  Hmm.  I hate when I read something that says, good hint, Ant. 
[03:47:30]  I have no clue what I said.  Sheep Lover writes, I learned today, Palestine starts with pal.  So Israel and Palestine should be pals.  Pals.  He also learned, if a horse or a mule kicks you in the face, you kick it back.  He also learned, in Monopoly, landing on luxury tax is better than landing on go to jail.  Hmm.  Jersey Gary learned, even a stubby-fingered midget like Rich Voss can feel like Michael Jordan  playing slam ball.  And now ONA know what it feels like to be soupy dreck. 
[03:48:00]  With his bad shirt.  His Voss shirt.  That's a crime, that shirt.  From yesterday?  Yeah.  With those little Hershey kiss nips.  I wanted to punch his chest with a sandblaster.  It was so annoying.  Everyone comments on his tan and he looks at him like, what are you, what?  What?  Of course I look like a black man.  I take my kids to the pool.  Rotten little dark Arabic areolas really annoyed me. 
[03:48:30]  Punch yourself from Jersey.  I learned today, the next time Paul Mercurio is on The Daily Show.  Yeah.  I'm looking at you.  I got it out.  Yeah.  They might turn the cameras on.  That's really good.  You're going to have to watch The Daily Show.  It's on tonight, right?  That is so goddamn funny.  There's some weird thing they're doing.  You're under arrest.  Taxi!  Hey, what's happening guys? 
[03:49:00]  Sweetheart.  Hey, Jason.  How are you doing today?  I learned today that Mayor Bloomberg is most assuredly still living.  Huddle, huddle, huddle to the ribs.  I'm punching out, Maverick.  Yeah, what's an elbow to the ribs?  Huddle, huddle, huddle to the ribs.  Huddle, huddle, huddle to the ribs.  Huddle, huddle, huddle to the ribs.  Had a stroke on elbow.  Bobby, what's up?  Bob?  Hey, sorry.  I learned today that I could listen to the radio for four hours straight  and learn absolutely nothing about what happened yesterday. 
[03:49:30]  That's true.  It is true.  And hey, I'm calling from Sacramento, and I, you know,  if you guys would have been recorded, I still would have learned the same nothing.  And you belong in a dump, you F.  There's Frenchie.  I was like, who hit the sound effect?  But it's really Frenchie.  You belong in Staten Island, you dumbass.  What's up, Frenchie?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  How are you doing something today?  Yeah.  How are you doing, Harry Hookline?  Hey, how are you doing, Bodie?  Huh?  Bodie?  I learned advice.  He's a wannabe guinea.  Of course he is. 
[03:50:00]  Yeah, I heard that in the back office yesterday.  It was funny.  I think it came from your mouth, Anthony.  Great.  Thank you for the credit.  Yeah, huh?  How are you doing, guys?  Very, very good.  Yeah.  Although we can't really say anything.  Yeah, I know.  You can't talk, yeah.  You know.  Ixnay.  Maybe I should say it in French, and nobody can understand it anyway, so, you know.  We can't even leave the building, Frenchie.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Coussois.  Coussois.  And anyway, those two retards, I didn't call them.  Thank God.  I never want to be stuck with those two asses ever again, all right? 
[03:50:30]  All right.  All right, Frenchie.  All right, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  Take it easy.  Bye, Angel.  Hey, see you later, honey.  Honey.  I like Frenchie.  It was a rough, rough, rough day for the boys.  Hey, CJ.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  What's going on?  I've been waiting for the last two hours for the brewer bit.  I know.  Today, I want to tell you, I learned that you guys just got blown off by arguably the biggest  dork in movie history. 
[03:51:00]  And according to the tape, Billy Staples is definitely not at the pinnickle of his career.  And pretty much lawyers ruin everything, right?  That's what I've always said.  Thank you, CJ.  Love you, guys.  All right.  I learned Anthony had his period to get out of gym class.  See?  We had a little education.  Hey, look at Sean from Sacramento.  We're live in Sacramento for the month of August. 
[03:51:30]  Yeah, you know, I learned it's kind of hard to listen to a show like this twice.  Oh, that's right.  But, you know...  They just replay it, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, I was wondering if I could use that to my advantage.  Hey, Sean, remember to drop off those movies today.  Oh, you might as well.  Hey, that's good.  Tom from Hoboken calling this the Godfather 3 of radio shows.  Oh, you suck.  Dad?  At least it wasn't Leonard Part 6. 
[03:52:00]  Nothing.  Just let it sit.  Yeah, sometimes you just got to let somebody take their body.  Just let it sit.  Look, he goes, nothing.  But you lost faith in that one between Leonard and Part 6.  Right.  Leonard Part 6.  I realized I should have picked a sequel.  Nothing.  Thinking Leonard Part 6 might have been the movie they made after Leonard Part 5.  Nothing.  The sixth installation.  I know.  That's why I had no... 
[03:52:30]  I'm like, uh-oh.  You didn't even wait to see...  I didn't pick a sequel.  You didn't wait to see if it was one of those things people had to think over and then you  get the late laugh.  Leonard Part 6.  Nothing?  Yeah.  Leonard.  Nothing.  No, it's only a problem with words that start with P.  You're right.  P-E-N, I think.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I think you can pinnacle P-I-N, but it depends on if you're from Buffalo.  Don't bring up Buffalo.  You know what?  You did miss a good sequel.  Pan and a Tentary 2. 
[03:53:00]  Thank you, Big Kev.  How are we doing in Buffalo?  How's that old debacle going?  I think the Buffalo problem is secondary at this point.  Yeah.  That's one good...  That's one plus.  It makes other things we do look really like nothing.  Yeah.  Let's get out of here, okay?  Although they do seem to list them.  Let's get out of here. 
[03:53:30]  Playing real rockin' Columbus.  This truly is the work of...  W-A-C-U, Circleville, Columbus.  Now that you know where you are, your prescription dose may need to be adjusted.  107-1, the Big Wazoo.  I don't want you to give it all up and leave your own life collecting dust.
