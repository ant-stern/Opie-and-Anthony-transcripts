<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with Greg Hughes, Anthony Cumia, and Jim Norton introducing themselves and the show's famously outrageous nature, referencing past brushes with the FCC.  Opie recounted a chaotic day involving his son independently taking an elevator multiple floors down and the disappearance of his 65-inch TV, suspecting his cleaning lady. The conversation then shifted to a recent studio visit by Terrence Howard and Jim Jefferies, focusing on Howard's peculiar habit of signing autographs backward.  Jim Norton, back from a comedy tour in Charlotte, detailed his experiences, including the last-minute ticket purchases of his fans and the secondhand account of Howard's backward signatures.  The hosts also discussed Opie's assistant, Kenny, describing him as robotic and even recounting an incident where Kenny pushed someone.

The show continued with Opie's underwhelming St. Patrick's Day parade experience with his son, whose disappointment stemmed from the lack of advertised circus animals.  A humorous digression ensued regarding the origin of several O&A shirts spotted at the parade. The discussion then veered into stories of Long Island bars, particularly Fast Eddie's, focusing on interactions with the Pagans motorcycle club and various bar fights, with a detailed account of one of Jim Norton's brawls.  This segment extensively covered bar fights, both from their college fraternity days and later in life, highlighting the increased pain of fighting with age.  A particularly graphic description of a beer pitcher thrown into a man's face was recounted.  The hosts also discussed the preemptive strike-and-run tactic in bar fights and an incident where a bar owner locked the doors to trap a group of bikers. The show included a discussion on the challenges of raising children, punctuated by another mention of Opie's son destroying his 65-inch TV.

Jim Florentine joined the show, engaging in conversation about their shared radio past and similar clothing styles.  David Lee Roth then appeared as a guest, discussing his time away from the spotlight, his love of cycling, and his Tokyo residence.  The conversation with Roth touched upon Japanese culture, sushi, and how old-school sushi bars handle unruly patrons.  The Mayor Bloomberg soda ban and its absurdity were also briefly discussed.  Numerous commercial breaks for Dollar Shave Club and Gamefly were mentioned.

A lengthy interview with David Lee Roth followed.  The conversation briefly touched upon Starbucksâ€™ response to potential legislation.  The interview extensively covered Roth's upcoming Van Halen tour dates (including Australia and Japan), Eddie Van Halen's health struggles, Roth's Greenwich Village childhood, his family background (including a brain surgeon uncle and a pot-growing aunt), his unsuccessful radio stint at CBS (including his unusual requests like "palm trees and sand"), his integration of various musical influences into Van Halen's sound (mentioning the specific BPM range for "girl-friendliness"), the band's internal dynamics, the infamous Brown M&M's rider clause (including a $400,000 damage incident at the University of New Mexico), his solo career, his music videos, his time as an EMT, and the reasons behind his solo career.  Anecdotes about his uncle Manny, Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and his unconventional upbringing were shared.  Roth also detailed the Brown M&M's story. The interview ended with plans for a future appearance of Roth's podcast on the Opie and Anthony show.

A two-hour interview with David Lee Roth continued, beginning with a bizarre story about a stalker's death in a shootout with police.  This led to a discussion of self-protection and firearms.  The conversation then shifted to Roth's career challenges transitioning from large to smaller venues, his diverse audiences (bikers, wedding parties), his musical style adaptations, his experiences at state fairs (bartering autographs for corn), his relationship (or lack thereof) with Sammy Hagar, his upbringing, his early R&B influences shaping his Van Halen sound, an encounter with a robber outside an Earth, Wind & Fire concert, detailed accounts of wet t-shirt contests at a biker bar he played at, his music preferences, his performance approach, and his thoughts on the internet's impact on the music industry.  He also promoted his radio show, podcast, and upcoming Van Halen dates. The hosts discussed the interview afterwards, highlighting humorous moments and Roth's nickname for his penis ("Little Elvis").  Listener calls followed.

The final segment focused on Trinidad James's song "All Gold Everything" and the success of "ridiculous" rap songs, including a debate about the song's radio edit and profanity.  A significant portion detailed a Saturday broadcast featuring Roland, a "sleeper cell," who hosted an impromptu "food court" in the studio with numerous chefs, extending the show by an hour and bumping Eric and his guests, Giddles and Pat Duffy, from their scheduled appearance.  The hosts discussed the situation, with Eric remaining nonchalant.  The segment also mentioned David Lee Roth's two-hour studio appearance in overalls, Who Kid's presence, the possibility of Jay-Z appearing due to Roland's cooking show's popularity, speculation about Dave's state of mind (with a running joke about him being found dead), and past and future shows, including one with Matthew Fox and Mary Lou Henner.  The discussion included numerous jokes, 90s culture references, and racially charged comments and slang.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on? Live? No? Is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment. 
[00:00:30]  And having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people, real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, there I am. Okay.  Oh, man.  I can tell Mars is in here today. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I have to turn my headphone volume up almost full.  Everything needs to be adjusted. Whatever.  I love when people fuck with things over the weekend.  At least Mars is justifying his job.  We know when he's not here.  Yeah, huh?  Some of these people that walk around here,  they take weeks off we don't even notice.  Radio wizard, what?  Hey, good morning, everybody.  Hey, now.  Hey, now.  Hey, now.  Yeah, man.  Stupid.  What's it, like Friday?  What is this?  Monday. 
[00:02:00]  Oh, shit.  But it was just Friday.  What happened?  Well, what happened was we had a weekend  where I had to just recover from my crazy day.  I'm feeling much better.  Are you?  Yes.  Timmy missed a hell of a story.  I love that.  I lost my son in my building.  Like a video game.  And I lost my 65-inch TV all in the same day.  And there were other things that happened. 
[00:02:30]  Well, how'd you lose your son?  He decided to follow Daddy down to the lobby  after I locked both locks.  But you didn't know he was behind you?  No, he wasn't behind me.  He's at that stage where he unlocks everything himself.  I hope he went down in the elevator to the lobby.  He pushed a box to get up high  to fucking unlock the other lock.  My wife's feeding the other kid.  Next thing you know, she hears the elevator door  and went, no, and jumped up right away.  And as she's running into the hall, like a movie, 
[00:03:00]  the doors are closing.  She panicked.  And the kid turned out to be about 20 floors below us.  Somehow he got in the elevator.  He learned.  And I need a clip from Bubble Guppies  because I forgot to tell you.  Late last night, someone tweeted me  and said there's a Bubble Guppies episode,  which is a kid's show.  Yeah.  Oh, you know Bubble Guppies?  Well, I see it on when I'm going through the channels.  You see like Dora and Bubble Guppies 
[00:03:30]  and then fucking all the...  Because he'll say stuff  and then we learn it's from one of his kid's shows.  Like he is like taking it all in.  And someone tweeted me and said  there's a Bubble Guppies episode  where they talk about putting five numbers in an elevator.  Why?  And that's how it works.  What?  Because my son goes,  he thought you push five buttons in the elevator  and that's where daddy is.  So he pushed his five buttons  and got off 20 floors below where we live.  Thank God there were cool people down there  that calmed him down until I got him. 
[00:04:00]  Was he panicking?  Oh, yeah.  Everyone was panicking.  Yeah, it was not fun for...  Was he crying when you found him?  Why wouldn't you put Bubble Guppies in the elevator?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, okay.  I'm sorry.  And that was after he decided to play T-ball in the living room  and take out my 65-inch TV.  Although, now we're very suspicious  that it might have been the cleaning lady.  What?  Because I'm very confused.  I never heard the big smack of the ball hitting the TV.  Did you line the ball up with the spider web?  And does it look like it could happen? 
[00:04:30]  Yeah.  If he hit a line drive, it could happen.  But my cleaning lady, which I share with Jimmy,  she was like using kind of a vacuum on the wood floor  that's kind of like with a long thing.  So you pulled back and smashed into it.  She could have pulled back right into it.  So now I'm very suspicious.  But I don't know how the hell I'm going to figure it out ever.  Man, you got out of the cameras.  But wouldn't you have noticed when you came home?  I was watching the Ounders and the Rangers.  And I looked down to check my numbers, as I call it. 
[00:05:00]  And I looked back up and the TV was black.  But she wasn't vacuuming while you were doing that, was she?  Yes, she was.  Oh.  Yes, she was.  Interesting.  And she was by the TV?  And my wife said she seemed a little guilty.  Well.  A little guilty.  That's her heritage.  So I'm out of 65-inch TV.  Whoa.  Well, you got to upgrade anyway.  You should have an 80.  I just bought this one.  Yeah, 80.  All right, I'll go 80.  Fuck it.  So you missed all this shit.  And then we had Terrence Howard in here.  Yeah.  Who was an amazing guest. 
[00:05:30]  And whose birthday is today, by the way.  Oh, happy birthday.  44 for Terrence Howard.  He was amazing.  I'm happy to hear.  He was great.  And then I wrote Jimmy because he's in Charlotte.  And I heard that went well.  And then I had to tell Jimmy I wasn't rubbing it in.  I just wanted to tell him how great it was because I know he was kind of bummed he wasn't  here for that one.  Yes.  No, I was happy to hear that.  You never want to hear that a guest was bad that you love because I would rather hear  that he had a great time and he wants to come back.  He'll come back.  He will come back.  He will absolutely come back because he had a blast, man. 
[00:06:00]  And Jim Jeffries in here with him.  I mean, that was fucking hilarious.  Yeah, it was a good combination.  On Friday.  And then Jimmy got a photo signed by Terrence Howard.  Which I'm waiting for.  He hasn't seen the photo yet.  And I'm telling Jimmy, he's never had this on a photo before.  So it's panicking Jimmy.  But I think he's going to find it extremely cool.  Will it make the photo?  Because I don't even know what this is.  You didn't see it?  No.  You know me.  Really?  Fucking bell rings.  I put my blinders on and run. 
[00:06:30]  Right.  And they're off.  Anthony heading toward the elevator.  The half and 23 and 5.  They're on the farter.  I'm crazy like that.  Will it make the picture something that Jimmy would be like, now this I have to display.  If there's all of his pictures laid out on the floor that he's going to display, would  he be like, now that one I've got to put up because this is something special.  That's a very good question.  Would you display a Terrence Howard picture to begin with?  Yes.  Oh, here comes the picture.  You only have three square feet of wall. 
[00:07:00]  Here comes the picture.  Jimmy wasn't here.  He was in Charlotte.  So Terrence Howard came in and signed a picture for Jimmy.  And he signed my flash, I hope.  Yeah.  And I'm telling you, you've never had this on a picture before.  All right.  In this way.  Let's see.  What is it?  There you go.  Thank you.  What is it?  All right.  Jimmy's taking it out of the nice little paper.  Yeah, exactly.  See the look Jimmy just gave?  That's pretty cool.  He signed it backwards.  Holy shit.  He signed it backwards.  But he signed it like you sign, but he signed it backwards. 
[00:07:30]  Do you understand what I'm saying?  He must have like figured out how to do that to fuck people up.  He went like this, like it's an autograph, but it's backwards.  That's great.  How fucked up is that?  That's great.  He didn't go from right to left.  He went like you're signing, but he signs it backwards.  He's done really well.  He's got like a talent.  That's like a talent.  That's got to be some weird shit with his brain.  Very cool.  And you don't have one of those, do you?  No.  That's something you learn how to do.  Yes.  Right.  And you do it well.  To freak people out. 
[00:08:00]  We saw him do it.  He didn't go right to left really slow.  He went left to right and signed it backwards.  That's fantastic.  Isn't that wild?  Yeah, because that's a real signature.  It's a nice signature.  He didn't do it.  He wrote to Jim Love Terrence Howard.  Yeah, it doesn't look like somebody that would do that for the first time.  No, that's how he probably signs his autograph.  Yeah.  Did he sign that backwards, too?  I don't know.  I didn't look at it.  I just know that that's a crash.  Can I see that?  Maybe that's how he just gives his autograph.  Or maybe that's a little subtle thing he writes. 
[00:08:30]  So if he sees it later, he'll know, oh, I hated this person.  Oh, shit.  Give me one second.  But how do you do that?  Do you think you could train your brain to sign your name backwards?  Fluently, like, just without thinking of it?  People can write ambidextrous.  I mean, this is something I can't comprehend.  I can't do that.  You must be able to.  I mean, the Hebrew.  Right.  People can write Hebrew.  That's backwards.  I mean.  He probably did it once, and then he probably did it, you know, right way, and then flipped 
[00:09:00]  it over and just kind of studied how you do it.  I could do that.  And practiced.  Oh, yeah.  You know what?  He didn't just sign his name.  He wrote to Jim Love Terrence Howard.  But all backwards.  All backwards.  He didn't just.  Huh?  He always signs backwards.  Always.  Yep.  That's his thing.  Yeah, look at all of his.  That is weird.  I wouldn't use dyslexic if that's an absolute dyslexia.  Wow, that's cool.  Or no, that's when you see the reverse letters.  I don't know, because he's got a really nice signature, too. 
[00:09:30]  Put an autograph.  It may be a way to stop fakes, because people who wouldn't know would obviously just sign  it.  That's true.  Oh, God, yes.  Yeah, but now people are onto him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, they're all.  They're all backwards.  That's how he signs everything.  God, I wish we knew that before he left, so we could talk to him about it next time.  Pretty cool, huh?  That's the side of the brain doing something, because he could probably just write almost  anything backwards.  He signed that backwards, too? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Crashes backwards?  Yeah.  On the DVD cover?  That's cool.  It's a, but it's a nice signature.  Yeah.  If you didn't, like, really look at it, you probably wouldn't even notice.  Right.  You'd probably just think, like, oh, yeah, he signed my thing.  Right.  Jimmy's happy.  Is that wild?  Yeah.  You don't have one of those, ever?  No.  He writes the, uh, I'm noticing he writes in, uh, yeah, see, he writes it, uh, in almost 
[00:10:30]  in, not script, in, uh, print, like a fancy print to Jim, so you can see the M is a little  messed up, so he actually has to think about it when he's writing words that probably aren't  Terrence Howard.  Right.  Yeah.  Um, but Terrence Howard, he's got to figure it out.  Yeah, he can do the, uh, signature, obviously, because it's his name.  That's really cool.  Yeah.  I'm a maniac.  We thought you would enjoy that.  Yeah, I would love to ask him.  What a maniac, yeah.  I would love to ask him about that.  Or anything, I'd like to ask him anything about that.  Yeah.  I heard Charlotte was great.  I debriefed Kenny on the way in.  I love debriefing Kenny about the Jim Norton trips. 
[00:11:00]  Debriefed on the trips, yeah.  I'd like to know if there's fans, where Jimmy's going, how the shows were.  It was, uh, it was unbelievable.  Our fans, I noticed, man, they buy tickets last minute.  Like, I look like...  Fuckwads.  But they are.  The Dices fans were like that, too.  They're just like last minute guys.  And, uh, it was tremendous.  It was, uh, sold really, really well.  Like, uh, both shows Saturday sold out.  Friday was excellent.  Thursday was excellent.  What an amazing club.  They treated me great.  They did.  Yeah, and the comedy show.  Look at that. 
[00:11:30]  And, uh...  Is Charlotte as good as they say it is?  It was...  So many people are moving to North Carolina.  I didn't go out.  You know, maybe.  I just...  Oh, God.  You gotta check out some of these places.  I know, but when I'm working, it's hard, man.  Because I'm on no sleep.  Once I start sleeping, I figure I'll start living a little bit like that.  Right.  But I'm not sleeping, so...  Even if you go out for an hour, just check out where you are.  Yeah.  I do morning press and go home.  That's what I love about you guys, that you get to see the country.  I would be out just wandering around for an hour or two every day.  I know.  I wish I could do that.  Brewer does that.  Brewer does that. 
[00:12:00]  Yeah.  Bill Burr does that.  Robert Kelly, not so much.  You, not so much.  Yeah.  Voss, he just finds the local golf course.  But at least he gets out, I guess.  Yeah.  Yeah, I just kind of stay holed up, dude.  I fucking...  I go out, I eat, I just go to the gym.  Me and Kenny, we look like such assholes.  We went for a walk, and I have the world's ugliest coat.  This black jacket I have, which I...  It's just...  It's Gore-Tex.  Dude, it's like a fucking garbage bag on me.  Yeah.  And Kenny has the same one.  Oh, really?  And I was actually physically humiliated walking down the street. 
[00:12:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Both of yous?  Yeah, look like two douchebags.  Yeesh.  Yeah.  Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumber.  That's hurtful.  My web guy went to the show.  He's a good guy.  And he told me that Kenny is exactly how we describe him.  Oh, really?  You'd never seen him before?  Goose egg-ish.  He tried to, like, just, you know...  He came up just to say hi, and he said he had a very, very robotic... 
[00:13:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, here it is.  He's not warm.  It's not like, oh, I felt some warmth from him.  He remembered the conversation, so he wrote it to me.  Me, meaning the web guy, okay?  Hey, Kenny, I'm Opie's web guy.  Kenny, robot voice.  Hello, sir.  Me, just wanted to introduce myself.  Kenny, I thought Opie was going to comp you tickets.  Me, yeah, I bought them earlier.  No big deal.  Kenny, okay.  Me, here's my car in case they F up Jimmy's website.  I'll do it for free the right way. 
[00:13:30]  Kenny, thank you, sir.  Me, I own a clothing company and bought Jimmy a shirt.  Kenny, thank you, sir.  Hey, that's all they'll say.  And then he says, he's a flesh-covered robot.  Great to watch.  You can tell it's not a character.  He's just a robot man.  Yeah, he is.  But he's our robot man.  Yeah, he is.  And you can't misinterpret that.  Even I know Kenny really well, and sometimes I misinterpret that.  He doesn't give a shit.  And I'm talking to him as a kid, but that's not it.  That's just Kenny's way of processing information. 
[00:14:00]  That's probably why he was a good cop.  Because you can process information without getting...  Just the facts, ma'am.  Yeah, but that's why he's illogical.  You can't get over on him.  That's why every time we get in a car accident, I'm just amazed by his lack of emotion.  His fucking...  That's all it is.  He'll instantly look like through that Terminator eye and chalk up the damage.  What happened?  Gather the information.  That's it.  And I've never seen him in a fight.  Like I told you one time I saw him push somebody.  I don't want to see that.  You saw him push someone, huh?  Yeah. 
[00:14:30]  Where'd that go?  It was like fucking Darth Vader with a force push.  Push into a wall.  No, but it was a quick reaction to something.  Like he reacts very quickly when it's like he's deceptive.  Yes, he's like a big dumb cobra.  But he's...  Yeah, but he's very sharp and he's there.  So it's like he will react and step in if there's a problem immediately.  But I think he almost does it on purpose.  Like not meaning to, but it's almost like his nature.  You know how a chameleon doesn't know it's becoming yellow or brown?  It just does. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Kenny's mind just behaves that way so people underestimate him.  Mm.  Mm.  And boy does it work.  I still don't know what he does for fun.  I have no idea what makes...  Do you see him getting you stuff in the morning?  Do you see him getting breakfast?  Do you think that's what...  Right now he's fueling my Escalade.  No, he...  That to him is an enjoyable day.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  If he checks off tasks...  But he likes checking off tasks. 
[00:15:30]  Well, it just keeps his brain going.  Exactly.  And I'm like last minute guy.  It drives him nuts.  Oh, yeah.  It drives him nuts because he's all about organization.  Oh, he's got the paperwork all done when we're going places.  I have him look into so many things for me that never come through.  Oh, boy.  It drives him insane.  Because I'll get an idea and he'll do all this work.  And then I'm like, eh, I decided against that.  Yikes. 
[00:16:00]  Let's get Greg and Charlotte on the phone.  He wants to represent Charlotte for Jim Norton.  Greg, go ahead, buddy.  Hey, Jim.  Thanks for coming out.  Hey, man, you look great.  Thank you.  Good show on Friday night.  You booted the guy.  You got really annoyed by him.  So it's pretty funny the way you handled the heckler in the crowd.  And final thought, I tried to get you working out in Friday in Charlotte,  seeing the city.  So I'll start with Mr. Maybe next time.  Thanks, buddy.  Yeah, he was a guy, one guy, only one guy removed during the whole time thing.  But he wasn't even being a dick.  He was a fan.  But he was just too drunk. 
[00:16:30]  And he was one of those guys where he was sitting stage left.  And there was a lot of people there.  And I could hear him a lot.  And so could the people around him.  But he wasn't yelling shit.  He wasn't going like fog.  He was just like, yeah, this guy is just good.  Like that type of guy.  Oh, God.  And they don't realize how loud they're talking.  So I tried a few times to shut him up.  I'd do a couple of my lines and I'd stop.  But then when they just keep going, I hear everything on the stage.  Of course.  But I say that and there's been fights that have been broken out.  And Kenny would be like, yeah, two guys had a fight. 
[00:17:00]  I'm like, really?  I didn't hear it.  I didn't hear that.  I say that and I've missed riots.  That's a riot in the background.  But from that close, I could hear everything.  And the guy was, I'm not tall.  And they threw him out.  And he was like, I'm Jim's biggest fan.  So I always hate to have guys like that taken out.  But he was just being accidentally disruptive.  Yeah.  Oh, he had to go.  Yeah.  All right.  And there's nothing we could do about it.  There's nothing we could do with it.  It's gone.  Couldn't be helped.  Ended up going to my bro's restaurant yesterday for Parade Day. 
[00:17:30]  Indeed he did.  Anthony was there.  Yes.  A bunch of fans.  And it was the big St. Paddy's Day parade for Huntington.  And my brother's restaurant is right on the parade route.  So it's perfect.  Yeah, that was fucking nice to be able to go into the restaurant bar, get some drinks, hang  out.  And then, you know, if you want to see the wonderful parade, you go outside and stand  street side.  And that's the reason I bring it up today.  Indeed.  I brought my young son, who is enjoying himself. 
[00:18:00]  He's adorable.  Holy shit.  Thanks.  Oh, my God.  Takes after my wife.  I walk in, and he's eating some mac and cheese.  And you're doing that kid, let me swallow my entire hand to get the mac and cheese in  me.  Yeah, they use it like spoons.  Yeah, yeah.  He's like that.  But he's looking up, and he's smiling.  And then he puts on the intense eyes.  He puts on the opi eyes.  He's got the intense eyes.  And then he just goes into a smile.  He's just trying to figure it out.  At one point, the kid's dipping cheese in his cheese. 
[00:18:30]  Why not?  I don't know.  Exactly why not.  He rocks agreeing.  He's like, yeah, you do that.  Yeah, exactly.  That's what you do.  Of course.  But anyway, because I brought him, I've been going to that parade for years.  And back in the day when I worked at BAB, I used to march in that dumb parade with the  radio station.  But I haven't seen it in so long.  So I'm like, ah, he's never seen a parade before.  So we got front row right next to the guardrail.  Yeah.  I put him up on the guardrail to check out the parade.  And the whole time on the way out to Huntington, he thought he was going to see elephants and 
[00:19:00]  tigers and giraffes and hippos.  What parade is this?  Well, he watches Dumbo.  And they have the circus parade.  Jimmy couldn't wait to get that out.  Oh, jeez.  And so we thought he was going to see a circus parade.  And he's been to the circus.  So he's putting the two together.  And I'm like, oh, no, the whole way out.  I'm like, oh, fuck. 
[00:19:30]  He's going to be he's going to be very disappointed.  Yeah.  Are you trying to, like, let him down easy?  Like, well, the hippos don't always show up.  Yes.  Yes.  And E-Rock said hi.  Yeah.  Of course.  So we saw the parade and I realized that the parade is just nonsense.  Yeah.  There's nothing going on in the parade.  It's people.  You're you're on the you're on the other side of the guardrail.  Excuse me.  And then then halfway through the parade, I'm like, all these people should be watching 
[00:20:00]  the parade.  Why are they in the parade?  That's what I noticed, too.  You're watching and then you see, like, a car drives by with the Huntington Town supervisor  in it.  Yeah.  And he's waving and they got, like, bunting on the car and shit like that.  And he drives by.  And then the next five minutes is people just with wacky St. Paddy's Day green hats on walking,  talking on their cell phone, eating.  Right.  And they're just kind of waving to their friends.  Yeah.  It's like, why are they even in this?  Exactly.  Parade.  And then it's every school in the area. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  But they're not, they're just walking.  Yeah.  They're not doing anything.  A couple marching.  No, not even marching bands.  Yeah.  They had some bagpipes.  Those guys were cool.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then a whole bunch of fire trucks.  And then car dealerships.  Yeah.  And then a car dealership guy will drive by.  And then I saw a tire.  There was a, a, a, like, flatbed truck.  Yeah.  From a tire company.  With people on the back throwing t-shirts with the tire company's logo on it.  Yeah.  Out.  It stunk.  It was like, it was the Huntington Yellow Pages parade. 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Where was the cool stuff?  There was nothing cool.  All these years I assumed I was missing cool shit.  Not one, like, kind of a, a floaty thing, you know, or a, a decorative, decorative vehicle.  They had a couple, they had a couple almost old cars.  Right.  And a couple almost old fire trucks.  Yeah.  Some Auga cars.  Almost.  Auga almost.  Almost.  Did the kid like it?  He was kind of bored.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I was, I was pumping it up.  And then the motorcycles came and he went, all right, that's scary. 
[00:21:30]  I'm like, all right, let's go inside, get some ice cream.  It's fine.  Let's get out of here.  He's being polite.  He just hated it.  He was like, this is fucking awful.  What did you take me here for?  You don't take him to the circus and then the Huntington Great.  No kidding.  You got to build up to that.  Right.  But in his ear, I'm like, isn't this cool?  I'm pumping it up the whole time because I could tell he's losing interest.  No tigers.  And then I realized, man, nothing cool is coming.  It was terrible.  Yeah.  It really was, you know, I don't know why, but I mean, it's a great day just to hang out  and have a few beers and stuff.  The weather was really nice. 
[00:22:00]  The parking around there is insane.  Did you get a ticket?  And driving around.  No.  And I parked illegally.  New York City, though, they would ticket that in a second.  It was right next to the bar.  Right.  So I was on the next street over, right there.  Right.  So I parked there.  It literally took 30 seconds to walk, whereas people are walking probably miles to get down  there.  It's a big deal.  So I just parked illegally.  But then when I went to leave, the entire street was packed with cars that were parked  illegally.  Oh, okay.  So, you know, I was like the first one to break the ice there, and then everyone just 
[00:22:30]  going, oh, I'm going to park here, too.  Yeah, no ticket.  I'm like, fuck it.  And if I did get one, it's the cost of doing business.  I don't want to walk two miles.  But that's the difference between living in the suburbs and New York City.  Yeah.  Suburbs will give you a fucking, you know.  They'd start towing.  If it was New York City, they would tow you for you just trying to get a parking space  in an area where there's no parking spaces available.  They would be out in full force yanking cars and ticketing everybody.  Yes, they would.  Fucking disgusting, what they do in this city. 
[00:23:00]  I went down there, had a great time, and oh, boy, yes.  Did you see Bobo and his little family showed up?  He kept his distance from me, which I completely appreciated.  He tweeted.  He didn't come over once.  He tweeted that he was there.  I swear.  He's literally 20 feet away from you.  Yeah.  And he tweeted, Opie, I'm here.  With my family.  With my family, say hi.  But I swear to you, I don't know who listens from his family.  I read that tweet. 
[00:23:30]  I was really not.  I was off Twitter for the most part all day.  One, because they have horrible service at FH Riley's as far as cell service.  Yeah.  And then I was just trying to just get away from him a little bit.  I did read it later on when I got home.  It's like, what?  That he tweeted to me 20 feet away.  When it ticked.  I mean, he could have came up and just said, hey, my family's here.  I would have walked over.  Yeah.  I was too busy making sure my son was being taken care of.  Oh, boy. 
[00:24:00]  But that parade, man.  Yeah, it's just awful.  It's just awful.  I don't know what they're supposed to do.  And has it always been that bad?  I honestly don't.  I remember back in the day when I did it for BAB, it was way cooler.  Yeah.  But I'm starting to think the whole PC bullshit that we all live in knocked down these local  parades.  Remember the parade where, was it cops or something with the float?  Did they do Black to the Future?  Was it Black to the Future?  Yeah, they did Black to the Future.  They used to allow these towns to kind of get a little silly with their parades. 
[00:24:30]  They let their hair down.  And I think after Black to the Future, where was that, in Brooklyn or Staten Island or something?  I think it was Staten Island, which makes more sense.  They obviously shut all that down.  So now you just get car dealerships in the parade and just dump stuff.  Nothing that you're going to be like, oh, that's funny.  Or, oh, look at that.  No lions, no tigers, no fucking hippos.  No elephants.  No elephants.  That was a shame.  Sorry.  Poor kid.  Sorry. 
[00:25:00]  I watch a dull fest.  I watch a bunch of fucking people in 2008 versions of O&A fan shirts drinking.  You know, we've got to get a new shirt out there, I think.  Yeah, right?  We've got to pump this shit up.  That was kind of cool, though.  A bunch of people were wearing St. Paddy's shirts from, oh, what?  Do you want to know the real story there?  Did you hand them out?  No, you want to know the real story there?  What?  You thought all those people showed up with those shirts?  Yeah, I thought, because I saw some people that I knew were fans.  My brother goes, I found a huge box of old St. Paddy's Day shirts in the attic or the basement. 
[00:25:30]  So they were handing them out yesterday.  It worked.  Half those people don't even know who we are.  Hilarious.  Okay.  It was just a green shirt to wear for St. Paddy's Day.  Sorry to bust your bubble.  I know.  I should have kept it between myself and I.  I thought people were, you know.  No.  No.  And a remembering.  No.  No, not at all.  I did see some fans, though, that were wearing those.  Yeah.  I guess they wanted a free shirt.  There's a few girls in there that I've seen naked. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  A couple.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I was telling Fast Eddie.  Someone.  I better shut up.  Oh, boy.  No, nothing bad.  Is he still doing magic?  Oh, yeah.  I like Fast Eddie.  Fast Eddie's magic.  Magic.  Magic.  It's magic.  I like him.  I remember the first.  I was working.  Me and Otto used to work Fast Eddie all the time in Long Island.  Mm-hmm.  And, uh...  It used to be a comedy club, for the people that don't know, that...  Top of the town?  ...my sister's father-in-law owned. 
[00:26:30]  Tuesday nights.  I asked Eddie the night, but I think it was Tuesdays.  Otto George night.  It would start at, like, 10 o'clock or 9.  Yep.  But, again, I didn't get up in the movie.  I gave a fuck.  And, uh, it would be a late show.  And the first time...  I would always want to work with Otto, because he was one of the only guys that would, like,  consistently murder there.  And the first time I heard of True Romance was right after the movie came out, which was  what?  Was that, like, 94 or something?  And Otto was doing...  Your great-grandmother, he did that monologue...  Oh, shit.  ...to some guy in the audience. 
[00:27:00]  Nobody knew what it was.  Wow.  What the fuck is he setting?  That's great.  Oh, that must have fucking had people just...  What the hell is he doing?  That's all I know, Otto.  That was, uh...  The movie had probably...  It might have been, you know, six months old or whatever, but it was still in the theaters.  And, uh, Otto, your great-grandmother...  And I was like, what is he...  Why would he say that to a guy?  Oh, shit.  And then when I finally saw it, I screamed.  Fast Eddie had it closed down, because he had his son bartending and my sister bartending,  who ended up marrying each other. 
[00:27:30]  And, uh, they gave away the bar.  Really?  Yeah, they had no choice.  It was all their friends coming every night.  Oh, right, yeah.  So how do you handle that?  You know, you try to be cool, but you're like, you know, every single person thinks they're  special, so...  Yeah.  They gave away way too much of the bar.  And that's, uh, one of the reasons why they closed back in the day.  What if I met you back then?  Or if we ever ran into each other?  We had to have.  Because if your sister was there, you might have stopped in at one point.  Yeah, I was there from, uh, when did we move to Boston, 98, 90... 
[00:28:00]  No, we got fired in 98, from 92 to 95, I was in that area.  So I absolutely ran into you.  Yeah.  I was watching the, uh, low speed...  I came down from Buffalo in 92.  You probably came to a show one night or something.  Oh, I was there all the time.  Man, after my, my BAB gig, I always, uh, ran over for a nightcap.  Me and my brother were playing there.  Me and my brother were playing there during the, uh, low speed OJ, uh, chase.  Really?  Yeah.  Fast Eddie?  I watched it there.  At Fast Eddie's?  Yeah.  Whatever it was called at that point.  Did we know each other?  Was it still Fast Eddie's or Top of the Town? 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, kinda.  It was during the OJ thing.  Um, it may have been pre-Electric Shock OJ.  I think it was.  Oh, then I didn't know you.  I knew of you.  Oh.  It would have to be.  It would have to be pre-Shot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, so.  So you played at Fast Eddie's?  We were playing there.  Me and my brother were playing.  And, um, and that's when the, the low speed chase started.  So everybody was at Fast Eddie's watching, uh, watching the low speed Bronco chase.  Yeah.  I think it was, uh, happening when I was doing my BAB music show or whatever. 
[00:29:00]  Mm.  Oh, that's so weird.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Fast Eddie's was a great place, man.  He had all the really good local Long Island bands and he brought in all the comics.  Florentine, you, Otto and George.  Bobby Levy, we all worked there.  Yeah, everybody that was doing anything on Long Island played there at some point.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, you know, they sort of gave away the bar.  Oops.  Because I, I, I never paid for anything and I know there was a hundred, at least a hundred  guys like me.  And I wasn't making any money so I wasn't going to complain or, or pull out my, I mean, 
[00:29:30]  I did what I could for what I was making, but.  I don't only go to places that I knew the bartenders.  I barely ever paid for booze when I was, and I was in bars all the time.  It's a tough spot.  I mean, my, my brother finally turned around and just said, everyone pays.  Family.  Because, you know, he would, he would have my uncles and aunts coming in and he was just  taking care of all the checks.  Yeah.  And then he started realizing, fuck.  So he, he made a policy.  Everyone pays.  I pay when I go in there even.  Yeah.  Then all of a sudden you start to give, you give it away and everybody's chucking him from 
[00:30:00]  the family shows up.  Right.  Nothing.  It's a, it's a weird, it's a tough spot to be in.  Yeah.  But he does that special thing for everybody when he can, but.  Every so often you fucking get a buy back.  That's fine.  Something or whatever.  Or throw a dessert or he'll just, he will pick up a tab here and there, but you know.  Yeah.  But the best was my mom working at that place.  It was fucking the inn, the inn at the crossroads there where Vets and Jericho split  off.  Sure.  And, um, I used to go there after I worked at a true mechanical, one of the air conditioning  places.  And I'd go in there and just a bar full of guys that were working, you know, working 
[00:30:30]  Joe's kind of guys.  And they'd, uh, they'd be like, Hey Rosie, get your son a drink over there.  Hey, get your, and I would sit there for hours just getting free drinks from all the  people that go, Rosie, set your son up for what a drink of.  It's great.  Every time you're in every single time, just getting fucking hammered.  Is that place still there?  I think it's a tit joint now.  See?  That's why.  I think it's a tit joint now.  Yeah.  It's a tough thing.  You know, how do you handle that? 
[00:31:00]  Well, they were buying, which is, you know, they were paying for it.  Right.  They're paying for it.  You drink it.  Uh, so that worked out well.  There were a couple of bars like that.  You ask me what my favorite beer is.  I say the free kind.  What the hell do I know?  We're going in.  Hey!  A regular Joe.  And then, of course, the wife was working at, um, at, uh, Off-Broadway.  In Greenland.  And, um, uh, the other bar was, um, I forgot the name of the other place.  But it was, uh, yeah, it was right.  Splinters.  Oh, right, right.  Good old Splinters.  Where the fucking, uh, bikers would come in to fight all the time. 
[00:31:30]  They'd be the local Long Island-like biker gang, which was, um, pagans.  The pagans.  And they would fight anybody else that rode a motorcycle that came in.  Right.  It was like, oh, here you go.  Pool cue balls over the head.  And fucking pool cues.  And, uh.  Why?  Because they were the pagans.  But why?  Just because you would ride a motorcycle.  Well.  Like, I never understood that culture.  It's sort of.  Is it kind of like, um.  This is our place.  This is our bar.  We, you know. 
[00:32:00]  But Joe, motorcycle guy comes in.  Sometimes they'd be cool if the guy was completely compliant that, you know, he knew this  was a pagans place and, uh, not to fuck around.  Uh, but sometimes he'd start mouthing off or say something to the wrong guy or look at  a girl sideways or one of the pagans would just be a little drunk and think that shit  was happening.  So it would always end up, like, we would have to go in because the, the, the wife there  worked after a Saturday night, coming Sunday morning and stuff.  And I'd go with her, grab a fucking egg sandwich and shit like that.  And there would be broken glass or blood on the floor or just, weekends there were insane. 
[00:32:30]  This is right in Greenlawn, right?  On Broadway in Greenlawn.  Right.  By the way, do you know how awful an egg sandwich in the pagans bar sounds?  That does not sound like a healthy breakfast.  It was wonderful.  We'd be smashing tiny cockroaches on the bar.  Oh, really?  And, uh, yeah.  Well, you would see cockroaches on the bar?  Yeah, yeah, cockroaches on the bar.  It was just a shithole.  But it was great.  It was the local shithole, which, uh, and I was on the Dart League there.  Oh, it was fantastic.  I kind of missed those.  Wednesdays.  I miss those local shitholes. 
[00:33:00]  I do, too.  I used to like on them.  That character.  And you could smoke in them.  Yeah.  Which was fantastic.  Just sitting there fucking smoking, watching a game.  Dude.  Yeah.  I was glad the pagans liked me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I had to do a lot of Long Island bar gigs.  I was glad they were on my side.  The pagans.  Yeah.  But I never understood that whole, uh, motorcycle thing.  And then there was a bunch of guys that rode motorcycles that were in splinters that tried  to make their own little motorcycle club. 
[00:33:30]  I think it was called something's orphans or it's nobody's children.  I think it was called something like that.  Nobody's children motorcycle club.  And, um, they started, well, they had jackets and so they had their, their colors made up  and everything.  And they, they had their bikes and they'd come in and stuff.  Oh boy.  Did the pagans put the kibosh on that when they got wind of it.  Really?  Yes.  Oh, did they come in and just told people to take it, take off your fucking jacket.  You're not fucking, you're not wearing colors in our bar. 
[00:34:00]  And there was a fight.  You never saw nobody's children anymore.  Oh God.  They didn't, uh, nobody's children didn't last?  No, it didn't.  Although a couple of nobody's children became prospects for the pagans.  So I guess they, they found the guys that could fight.  Right.  And brought them all right.  You, you, you, you're over here now.  You're over here now.  Every once in a while.  Huh?  Are pagans still around?  Yeah.  I believe so.  Yeah.  I remember hearing about them.  It's been many years, but I believe so.  They're like the Long Island Club.  And then occasionally the, uh, chapter of the Hell's Angels would come in and they'd fight 
[00:34:30]  and, you know, over meth rites, I guess.  I don't know.  Pagans are fucking frightening when they fight.  Because you know that they'll just pick up any type of a piece of metal and hit you  with it.  No rules.  It's amazing.  Chains.  The fucking, the big socks with fucking master locks in them.  And they just swing.  Imagine getting hit on the side of the head with a lock.  A chain with a lock on it.  No, thank you.  Any kind of shit to stick you with.  And then if push comes to shove and it really gets bad, the guns come out.  But it's, uh, it's rare the guns come out. 
[00:35:00]  They usually like fighting and beating each other over the head with two by fours.  I haven't heard about them since that really bad incident at that, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  Was that a casino or something?  No, it was out on Long Island, that rock club.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Vanderbilt?  I think we did a gig there with Jim Brewer back in the day.  The Vanderbilt.  Vanderbilt.  Is it called the Vanderbilt?  Yeah, there was a stabbing and shit.  It was.  What is it now?  I don't know.  The company that owned it sold it off as a catering hall and then it shut down.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was kind of a cool place, but there was a big incident there. 
[00:35:30]  I haven't heard much of, uh, Pagan since then.  Yeah, they were like the Long Island Biker Club.  They're listening to us right now, man.  You better say hi.  They're out there.  I was always cool with them because, you know, my wife was tending the bar there, so they  were, you know, and they protect the bartender.  Forget about it.  You couldn't fucking do anything to the bartender.  But the bartender then again couldn't tell them to stop fucking bashing someone's face  in with a cue ball.  Well, everyone had an understanding.  Yeah, you know, it's compromise.  Don't break the jukebox. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah.  We need that next Tuesday.  Yeah, don't throw a cue ball through the fucking TVs because we're watching shit.  And you can smash that guy's skull if you want to.  Chairs out.  We'll get more chairs.  That's easy.  What a time.  How bad would it have been for me if I walked in there with, like, a jacket?  Like, I was the only member.  And if I turn the music over and say, guys, I'm trying to get a motorcycle club started.  So if anyone's not happy here, I'd love you to join my motorcycle.  Honestly, they'd probably laugh their asses off. 
[00:36:30]  And then if they got over the line with the booze a little, they'd beat the shit out of  you.  But I think initially it would be pretty funny.  Yeah.  Gentlemen, motorcycle club.  I want to start it up.  I have, like, a little application you could sign up and fill it out.  Just hand them out to everybody.  Yeah, guys.  Oh, Jesus.  And here's your membership dues.  They were intimidating.  Here's the bylaws.  They were intimidating to have in the bar.  Like, when, you know, four or two came in, you could normally just, like, if they're sitting  at the bar and you're drinking, you have a conversation with them. 
[00:37:00]  There's no problem.  But when, like, five or six of them would come in, you knew just the best policy was  probably just not to say anything.  Because even if you were being friendly and cool and everything, you didn't know when they  would just turn and, you know, oh, now I'm in a bad mood.  Oh, that motherfucker was talking to me.  Let me punch him in the face.  Right.  It's like, hey, but we were cool.  What happened?  You're describing a lot of people's Friday nights.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Not just motorcycle guys.  Oh, true.  Yeah.  Why did you fight? 
[00:37:30]  I don't know.  He looked at me weird.  But I got in a fight with a guy that I later became kind of friends with.  And it was weird because I went years looking for this guy because I want to smash him over  the head with a rock or something.  And then I didn't even, and I kind of remembered who it was, but then I couldn't, and I was  sitting at the bar talking to this guy and he goes, you look familiar.  Did we have a fight?  And I was like, and then it hit me.  I'm like, that's the guy for fucking years.  And now he's sitting right next to you?  And we had been talking for a while before that. 
[00:38:00]  So I'm like, now he's like a cool guy that I enjoy fucking talking to.  And I wanted to, for years, I dreamt of killing this guy.  Because he was an asshole.  I was with my friend at a bar, of course.  And my friend was like all drunk and shit.  And I guess he wanted a cigarette.  So he grabbed the pack that he saw in the bar and just grabbed one out of it.  And it was this guy's pack.  And he couldn't let it go.  Wow.  And I was even trying to go and do it.  He was just wanting a cigarette.  I go, it's cool and everything.  If you want a pack, you don't have to be, fuck you.  I was like, I was like, and I knew my buddy was fucking hammered. 
[00:38:30]  So I was like, let's, let's just get the fuck out of here.  This is going to get bad.  So we went to walk out of here.  And I hear, I hear, I hear some walking behind us.  I turn around.  It's him and another guy.  And I'm like, oh, fuck.  So it's in the train station parking lot there in Greenlawn.  And yeah, they just fucking charged at us.  So I'm on one guy just fucking punching and getting punched.  And then the other guy went after my friend. 
[00:39:00]  And he was so drunk.  He just had to, he was beating him with impunity.  And then the cops showed up.  How bad were you guys beat?  Pretty good.  I got a good piece of the other guy.  And I'll be honest, I'm not a fighter, but I got a couple of good shots.  But my buddy just got hammered because he was so drunk.  He couldn't even defend himself.  And this guy had no like, he wasn't like, oh God, the guy's drunk.  He was like, oh, this is easy.  I can just beat the piss out of him.  So all I wanted to do was like, fuck this guy up for years.  And then it turned out to be the guy.  So when you, when he said, didn't we fight? 
[00:39:30]  Did you go, oh yeah, that was the, I went, I went, oh, and then it hit  me.  I'm like, that was out in the train station.  He was like, yeah.  And to him, it was one of a thousand fights.  It's just like, yeah.  And to me, it's like, that's the guy that fucking built hatred in me for  probably four years.  I wanted to kill him.  I only had a few fights.  So they are all, I remember every single one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's me too.  You're right.  There are guys like that.  I was like, bah.  He's forgotten more fights than I've ever had. 
[00:40:00]  And that isn't even, I'm not even exaggerating.  One of the, one of the guys that I, um, hang out with in, uh, Philly is,  you know, I call it the Philly crew for real.  Uh, one of the guys fights almost every weekend.  Oh, it's exhausting.  How do you do that?  Kenny, Kenny wants, uh, we're in a hotel in Philly.  See the guy that had braces?  Huh?  The guy that had braces.  Oh man.  Kenny remembers.  It's like Kenny, Kenny legs.  It was one of Jim Norton's shows and, uh, I think it was new year's. 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  It was new year's and we're all hanging out.  And, uh, me and, uh, it wasn't my wife at the time.  We went to a house party with everybody.  Great house party.  It was like three levels.  We went all the way to the top, all the way down, had a drink or two.  And Kenny, uh, before, you know, I went there, he's like, you sure you don't want me to go?  I'm like, nah, man, this is fucking, I know a lot of these people.  Sure.  So we, uh, we leave this house party.  We get back to the hotel all nice.  And I guess five minutes after we left, there was an all out brawl. 
[00:41:00]  Wow.  With this guy that fights a lot.  And he was thrown down the stairs and other people, it was bad.  And a few of the guys came back to the hotel room, a bloody mess.  Remember that, Ken?  Yeah.  And the only reason why he didn't get his teeth punched out of his face is because he had the braces and that's what kept him in.  Really?  Oh, wow.  That is the guy I'm thinking of.  He's a pretty stocky guy, though.  No, he, he does very well.  Yeah, he's a squat, like, strong looking dude.  This kid does really well.  And, I mean, we worry about him all the time because now, now he's like a father. 
[00:41:30]  So we're hoping that he calms down a little bit.  Calms that shit down.  But I, I know of at least, I don't even know.  It's, I don't know.  At least a dozen.  At least.  That's too much.  That I know of.  I can't imagine.  You know, it's funny, this, uh, guys like that who can really throw down.  And it's like, I've always wanted to be that guy.  But like this, there's a comic I know named Mike.  And he was telling us, he's from like, I think he's from like Brownsville.  He's a black dude.  He's from a really tough area.  And he was telling us about this one guy that had like 60 confirmed street knockouts. 
[00:42:00]  Like just one of these guys.  That's got stats.  Everybody out.  Yeah, yeah.  He said he would do it quick.  And he said one time he was going to fight this guy at the gym.  And the guy knew who he was.  He goes, am I fighting you?  Right.  He just shot him.  And then he's dead.  All right, yellow belly.  What?  He shot him?  Shot him dead.  Yeah, like the guy, the guy got shot dead.  Like some other guy didn't want to fight him because he had so many knockouts.  And he knew that this guy will knock me out.  So I shoot him.  You knew the fighter?  No, I didn't know either one of them.  The comedian I know is relaying the story.  That's what will happen, though.  That's what happens to a lot of tough dudes.  With people that fight a lot, one day they're going to meet up with somebody that doesn't 
[00:42:30]  want to fucking fight.  He just stabs him or shoots him.  And will stab you or shoot you, regardless if it's justified or not.  Right.  In the end, that doesn't matter when you're dead.  This kid has a very good record.  Yeah, huh?  He looks at it as a sport.  Or did.  Did.  Hopefully did.  He's getting older now, so we're hoping.  I always hated that.  Because we love the kid.  He's great.  He's really a nice dude.  I don't enjoy a fight.  But when he drinks.  Oh, fuck no.  Yeah.  Drinking is a huge part of the fighting.  I've never seen, in a bar, two sober people fighting. 
[00:43:00]  Never!  They love fighting when they drink.  You know who's a problem?  Fucking Sherrod.  Really?  Comedian Sherrod.  Yeah, yeah.  He's the nicest guy in the world.  You can't believe it.  But sometimes you'll see him over at the bar at the Comedy Cellar.  And he's fucking just kind of like...  And he's not doing it to be a...  He literally is just not even thinking about it.  But he's just kind of punching his knuckles against the wood part of the bar.  Oh, boy.  He used to do that.  He's just got these big, meaty fucking fists.  And he's got a few... 
[00:43:30]  He's got a few knockouts.  A few fights?  A few knockouts?  Yeah.  But you really have to push him to get him to hit you.  He's not...  What's his name?  A bully guy.  He's just a big fucking...  If you annoy him enough, his fist is just really loud.  Fuqua there.  Yeah.  I saw him just...  Oh, my God.  It was at the Borgata.  It was one of Jimmy's shows again.  Yeah.  That's way back.  And one year we went to...  They set us up in a club.  And sort of like...  I guess it's a VIP area. 
[00:44:00]  I don't know.  It was up higher.  And Fuqua, who doesn't drink, is with his lady.  And some dudes, some tough white Philly dudes, come over thinking that he stole their bottle  of vodka.  And he's like, I don't even drink.  But they didn't want to listen to that.  They just want to fight.  They thought he stole his fucking...  It got to a point where he picked up a chair like a lion tamer.  He took on three fucking guys.  He's fighting off a couple of people with a chair.  He knocked one of them out.  It was unbelievable. 
[00:44:30]  The guy went down like that.  And then the other two guys were trying to get at him because he knocked out his friend.  Yeah.  He knocked out their friend.  Wow.  And long story short, the huge motherfucker bouncers are taking Artie out.  You know, basically carrying him out.  And Artie's still just fighting his way out.  And I'm thinking to myself, he's going to be arrested.  He warmed up for Jimmy that night.  He was on the bill.  Next morning, down at breakfast, there he is just having breakfast. 
[00:45:00]  Everything's cool.  No problems whatsoever.  He somehow got out of it.  He's a good scrapper?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because I guess they knew that he didn't start this fucking thing.  Right.  But he's another dude who's a nice dude.  He smiles every time he talks to you.  But you know, well, I now know that, man, he could turn on at any moment.  And he's someone not to fuck with.  But he's kind of like other guys I like who can really, who are not afraid to fucking get  a fist in their face. 
[00:45:30]  Yeah.  He's not a tough guy.  He's not like a bully.  He's not like that type of an asshole.  He's just a nice dude.  That can take care of himself.  Yeah.  But he's a really nice guy.  Yeah.  He took care of himself.  Absolutely.  What does this have to do with anything?  I don't know.  I was just talking about bars and shit.  Which is fine.  Colin, you know, whose last name I will not say.  Oh, what?  He had a funny bit one time about how when you walk into a bar or a club.  I see two Jews, they own it.  No. 
[00:46:00]  Well, he actually said something about, I was just going to try to riff and I blanked.  I literally, that was real.  I went to riff and my mind just went, nothing funny to be said here.  The dimmer switch went to zero.  So, but he had a bit about how you size each other up when you fight.  And that's what a guy thinks.  Could I kick that guy's ass?  Right.  And the bit was obviously funny.  But that really is what men think when you walk into a place.  You size each other up immediately.  Yeah, you got to know your threat level that's around there.  That's such a primal thing, man. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  That is really ancient, instinctual, where you walk in and the first thing you have to do  is look around, see who's in there, see who might be a problem.  You know, not even on a conscious level sometimes.  But you will look around the room.  Right.  And see.  And if there is somebody making a problem, you'll, like, note that.  Yeah.  I don't like that, man.  I hate getting hit.  Oh, do I hate it.  I don't like it either.  I would love punching people in the face.  But I hate getting hit.  It keeps me from fighting. 
[00:47:00]  You get older and you realize how much that really fucking hurts.  And for days on end, the initial bang is bad enough.  But then, like, six days later, you're just, oh, it's still tender.  When I was in college and, you know, part of that fraternity, there were fights every  weekend.  Just because we were in a fraternity and there was another fraternity in the bar.  Well, at least you had a good reason.  Yeah, exactly.  It was the main bar, the in-between for the people that had no Geneseo.  And everyone would have their spot.  Yeah.  Every fraternity would have their spot and every night would end with a fight. 
[00:47:30]  Hey, that's my turf.  Whether it was your fraternity, there was definitely a fraternity versus fraternity fight every  weekend.  And the next morning at the fraternity house, everyone would be like, kind of figuring out  who's really her.  They're mostly just bruised and achy.  And in a weird way, it was cool.  But then, like you said, you get old enough and you get hit and you're like, yeah, this  isn't fun at all, man.  This fucking sucks.  What have you, a jaw-broken must-sucker, your teeth knocked out?  I'm like, who the fuck wants that at this age?  All the fights I saw when I was, you know, in college with this fraternity, not many bad 
[00:48:00]  ones.  Not many, like, where someone had a broken jaw.  Just fists and, yeah.  Yeah.  When I look, I'd fall back into something, like a guy would hit me and I'd just clumsily  step on my heel and then my teeth would hit a door handle.  Yeah.  It'd be some complete douchebag way of getting your teeth knocked out.  And then years of trying to fix what happened in a split second is like, yeah, if your jaw's  broken, now you're fucking, you fell back in your head and you're retarded. 
[00:48:30]  Fuck.  The worst incident I saw when I was in Geneseo, I don't even like talking about this one.  It was horrifying.  It was, then you had the locals in Geneseo back in the day.  Well, they must have hated the college pukes.  They did.  And they would go in these-  Picking our chicks!  They were going in these bars and they were way tougher than any fraternity because they  were a lot older.  They were like, you know, if we're 18, 19, 20, these guys were like minimum 25 to 30.  Yeah.  And they're working in fucking, you know, machine mills and coal mines. 
[00:49:00]  There's a salt mine up there.  A salt mine.  Like, they were real blue-collar guys.  Dry hands.  Yeah.  But you're in a fraternity thinking, you know, you could handle anything.  But I remember one of the townies, I don't know why, but took one of those heavy-duty  glass beer pitchers.  Oh, yeah.  Remember the old days?  They don't make them like that anymore.  Now they're plastic.  They're plastic.  But remember, they were thick glass.  Fucking, you could smash someone's skull.  I swear to you, I saw this and half the bar saw this. 
[00:49:30]  This guy took it by the handle, and as hard as he can, like this, sidearm, bam, right into  the side of this guy's face.  How does somebody do that and not think, oh, I'm just going to take the murder rap?  Because this could kill the guy.  I'll just take the murder rap.  Yeah.  The girl I was with at the time, she had actual glass in her hair, even though we weren't  that close to the incident.  Wow.  This freaking glass pitcher just shattered.  The Geneseo people from my day know this story.  And then, I think it was Basher, who owns the place, got the kid out that got hit and 
[00:50:00]  packed his whole head, basically, in snow.  It was in the middle of winter.  And supposedly, that's what saved this kid's life.  He had a scar.  He was gone from school for about a year.  He had a scar, if I remember correctly, pretty much from his temple all the way down to his  chin.  I wonder what he was doing.  To this day, I don't know.  I don't know.  It must have been something.  I don't even know.  I don't even like talking about that, because I do go up to Geneseo every once in a while. 
[00:50:30]  So, I'm not going to pick a side on that one.  I have no idea.  Get a fucking picture across your head years later.  Unbelievable, man.  That was literally the worst thing I ever saw in a bar.  It's pretty brutal.  You know, you see people get knocked out here and there.  Oh, yeah.  That one was just, wow.  You saw a guy that could have easily just died right in front of your face.  I don't like how fast bar fights are.  They're usually just, you know, motherfucker.  Yeah.  And someone won.  A whole bunch of glasses are thrown up in the air or whatever.  Drinks are, you know, pushed over. 
[00:51:00]  Chairs are pushed over.  That seems to be the best thing to do.  From all the videos you watch and everything, the best possible thing you could do is end  the fight before it starts.  Like, people wait and be like, yeah.  They square off and do that whole we're going to fight thing.  If you have an ankling that a fight's going to happen, you just, I've seen so many videos,  just punch someone in the face.  And that's it.  And run.  I saw a fight at a bar.  It was, I want to say Brooklyn or the, I don't even remember.  And there was, there was bikers that was getting rowdy and they started fucking around and 
[00:51:30]  and the guy came in and locked the door and he said like, now you can't leave.  And it just got real.  Oh, Jimmy.  Fuck, man.  Wait.  That's not some.  Wait, no.  No, I mean, I wish you got a break.  No, that's just a thing I saw one time.  You saw it on a screen, didn't you?  No.  What movie is that?  No, I didn't.  It's not.  Oh, jeez.  I was in a bar and I saw a bunch of bikers and they were fucking around in this Italian  bar.  Right, right.  The guy kept saying, leave, leave.  Did he give him a chance to leave like earlier? 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, he said, leave, leave.  I probably told this story already.  Yeah, he said, leave, leave.  And then.  Oh, that took a while.  Yeah.  With Louie beans there?  What?  No, no.  And then they said that you can't leave.  Oh, no.  You know what?  This was in Florida.  Oh.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  They said, now you can't leave.  Yeah, Iraq's hometown.  Mm-hmm.  They came out of pool queues and shit.  Oh.  A bunch of mob guys.  That's a good story.  Yeah.  I was out there.  Me and my mafia friends just hanging out. 
[00:52:30]  A bunch of mafia friends were hanging in Florida.  Shoot the hostage.  Yeah.  I went on the fucking boat.  It was cool.  Oh.  Yeah.  It was really cool.  Iraq's boat.  Yeah, they took me out.  I brought the guy a card, gave him some money in the card.  Fucking loved me.  Oh.  Oh, well, that one.  Yeah.  That'll happen.  I mean, Donnie Brasco.  What?  No.  No.  Hang out.  Oh, okay.  I got you.  You can't leave.  I'm like, what the fuck, dude?  You want to know? 
[00:53:00]  What happened?  Never.  Compulsive liar guy.  Yeah.  And won't give it up.  Yeah.  Even when he knows.  Then he changes the detail from the movie.  Oh, no, no.  That's right.  It was Miami.  Not Miami.  Hey, I got a guy that used to work at the In-Between.  Dave.  Yeah, oh.  I used to work at the In-Between as a bouncer.  I think it was before your time.  But you're absolutely right.  That fraternity fight has been going on there forever.  Yeah, see, I didn't need backup, but I mean, Geneseo is one of these colleges where everyone  joins a fraternity or sorority, so there's a problem every week. 
[00:53:30]  I'm talking about most colleges, I would assume, especially old school when, you know,  I don't know.  Go ahead, Dave.  Sorry.  I got a question for you.  Was Gentleman's Gym still happening when you went to college, the other bar across the  way?  GJ's.  That ended up becoming a bookstore, yeah.  Bookstore.  Okay, well, the local Relate, the Good Rats, back in the 70s, were up there all the time.  Yeah.  That's how the Penny Arcade up in Rochester and everything. 
[00:54:00]  That's how the Rochester area got introduced to the Good Rats.  The Good Rats.  Yeah, no, they were big back then.  Pepe Marcello.  Yeah.  Tasty.  Good Rats did a lot of time up in western New York.  Tasty.  I like that song.  Tasty.  Can we play a little Tasty today, E-Rock?  Oh, man.  We're not going to do Good Rats today, though.  Thanks, Dave.  I appreciate it.  Okay, man.  It's good.  All right.  Tasty.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to break it.  Let's fuck it.  Do we have any audio of this Valerie Harper goodbye?  Yeah, we'll figure it out. 
[00:54:30]  What?  Miserable.  Don't talk over Tasty, please.  A little taste of Tasty.  And we'll be back.  We had a flying guitar man, maybe the fastest in the land, but he was going nowhere fast.  Speed ain't nothing without class.  He couldn't play Tasty, oh, no.  Tasty like this man, yeah. 
[00:55:00]  Tasty, Tasty.  Ain't it time we mellow out?  We had a man named Crazy Art.  He overplayed his bass a lot.  We had to kick him in the pants.  His fingers moved out by this dance.  Couldn't play Tasty, oh, no.  Tasty like this man, yeah. 
[00:55:30]  Tasty, Tasty, ain't it time we mellow out?  We had a drummer named Joe.  He played so fast we let him go.  He ran away with all our songs.  Now he's in school where he belongs.  He could play Tasty, oh, no. 
[00:56:00]  Tasty like this man, yeah.  Tasty, Tasty, ain't it time we mellow out?  We got some Tasty harmony.  Sometimes there's two, sometimes there's three.  We like to sing it now and then.  Mostly we save it to the end. 
[00:56:30]  We're gonna sing Tasty, oh, yeah.  Tasty like this now.  Ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da-da, ba-da-da-ba-ba.  Tasty, ooh, Tasty, ain't it time we mellow out?  We love to play that rock and roll.  Man, that's the only way to play.  A drummer bass and two guitars.  When you play a Tasty, you go far. 
[00:57:00]  You go with me.  Tasty, oh, yeah.  Tasty, Tasty, rock and roll out.  Tasty, Tasty, ain't it time we mellow out?  We're gonna be Tasty, oh, yeah.  Tasty like this man, yeah.  Tasty, ooh, Tasty, ain't it time we mellow out?

[01:04:30]  to go to a two shot or a long shot and the people like even the host on the couch like looked around  like what the hell was that never not funny it's never not funny is right that's gotta be weird you  guys follow each other in and out of these cities huh yeah it's always funny when i'm coming there's  always like some kind of story you know they relate to you when you come into town i like it though  because it's something to talk you know you have such a history together that it's always something  to talk about it's like a good jumping off place to talk about florentine because you know we know 
[01:05:00]  each other so well that's great i told the club owner i said please jim's coming here in three weeks  please tell him that story nice that's what i kept and i even text him like a week ago i remember to  tell jim that story he told me that on the way from the airport to the hotel that's right yeah  florentine like almost before he forgot to make sure he told me so second kid maybe no oh i thought  you said i talked into it no i'm just saying you said we're alike so next thing i know now okay yeah 
[01:05:30]  second kid you know that's a lot more work you think you have a lot of work now yeah that's  that's one of the reasons now i couldn't imagine i just can't even imagine can't fathom any of that  i mean you know i i know a lot of people that have kids and that's fine and dandy you know  bring them over the house it's fine i don't i'm not i'm not like get that kid out of here but  i couldn't imagine having to be responsible for something oh god or not being able to do something 
[01:06:00]  or not just being able to sleep like if i'm on the couch and i'm just like uh you know what i'm  just gonna crap out for three hours boom and not have to worry that some little  fucking life form is gonna stick a tweezer in the socket some of the or something you know i know my  my son just stuck a tic tac in my ear yesterday oh that's good i almost had to go to the emergency  room my wife had to take it out yeah with tweezer i was just laying there and he was messing around  my ear and he dropped one in there and it went way in the back i'm trying to pull it out oh yeah  how old's your kid two and a half yeah we're right around the same age our our uh sons they're they're 
[01:06:30]  dangerous right yeah i'm worried about getting a broken nose or oh yeah or a concussion or get  knocked out by this thing it is cool like that there's moments where like you know he'll just  hang me on the couch like your buddy yeah those are great moments but there's a lot it's almost  like dating like a drama queen like a complete disaster that she's amazing in bed she brings  chicks home you know you have threesomes the the fucking for like an hour and a half is 
[01:07:00]  unbelievable out of control but the you know then pretty much the rest of the day is a disaster  you're just cleaning up messes all day long there's no reasoning or anything  fuck i lost my 65 inch tv he played t-ball in the living room and i just gave up i gave up last  week because the whole family's been sick the audience is sick of this story but i gotta just  tell you real fast part of it the whole family's sick at the same time so i just let my guard down 
[01:07:30]  said do whatever you want i don't care i'm so sick so he set up his t-ball in the living room and uh  line drive that right into my 65 inch tv with that wood was it the yellow wooden ball with the  smiley face on it that somebody tweeted she goes is this the ball because i kind of described it on  the air but you didn't describe it that much no i didn't it's the exact fucking ball that he he put  on the tee a tiny little it's it's a little bigger than maybe a golf ball but it's hard as  shit with a with a jingly thing inside it's probably our housekeeper she's probably the one i called in 
[01:08:00]  with it like was that the one yeah so now i gotta get a fuck and that tv i just got and i don't think  i i we talked about it friday i don't think you could fix these new new fucking flats like that  just no you get a new one you gotta hang them high man so he doesn't know it and i started thinking  fucking pop fly well i'm starting to think it was a little too low because he started dragging his toys  against it and stuff a line shot up the middle that one right into the screen right  right that's gonna cost opie oh fuck have you lost anything yet no not really nothing valuable 
[01:08:30]  no you call me when i hide shit i know man i'm i'm two steps ahead of him all the time yeah yeah  it's like i could fucking i should be out i should be able to outsmart a two and a half year  i should you think i do and i know every movie's gonna make i don't put this here because he's gonna  grab my phone if it's on the edge so you stick it in the middle right i got him i got him i'm one  step ahead of him yeah yeah yeah you gotta be my wife not so much she still leaves her  shit laying around i'm like you're crazy every time my laptop my phone everything is just like 
[01:09:00]  jimmy uh jim saying now but he gets up on the tall tables now so now i'm going even higher my  shit is way up in cupboards and stuff that's what i got to do with candy because my ex was five nine  and i'm a little shorter i literally just found we broke up a year and a half ago i just found candy  on the top shelf that she used to hide from me so she treats you like a little kid it was  fucking humiliating i i had to get up and get something out of there and i realized she had  hidden candy she hid it from you or she from me yeah because she knew that i would eat it if i 
[01:09:30]  saw it but then she wanted trying not to so she wanted candy and she hid it on the top shelf  did you eat it when you found it no but there was some bubblegum i ate the candy i threw out but  the bubblegum i ate there was some like really good sugary bubblegum very uh very happy florentine's here  and one of the reasons jim is here besides the fact we haven't seen you in a while is the uh  that david lee roth's coming in so we figured you'd help us out with that yeah i i talked to david lee  roth years ago on the phone that's all i'm saying yeah i don't know i don't know what kind of guy he 
[01:10:00]  is anymore it was like in just a normal you know kind of rocket he seems like a fun guy oh he totally  is he seems like he's into partying that's his whole like you know i mean we have some weird history  because we you know we both worked for the same company that was how radio goes well i used to run  into his manager i ran into his manager at the an almost brother's show and managers are never a  reflection of the personality i hope not because this guy knew exactly you know the history between 
[01:10:30]  us and david lee roth yeah he was pissed because that's money came out of his pocket david lee roth  is like i don't care i still got van halen money coming in yeah we took over for david lee roth  i mean we never had an actual issue with him no they fired him and hired us who the  fucking waited say no he only lasted like four months right and they got yeah what are we going  to say uh no we don't want to take the job because we don't want to uh make it seem like david lee roth  wasn't doing a good job on the radio i'd like to go into k-rock and uh do a radio show but nah  we did no loyalties and fucking this dumb ass business we did all right for sure they just 
[01:11:00]  couldn't figure that out because we were they they desperately wanted us out of our xm contract to  to you know yeah to do full speed ahead for k-rock full time yeah they could only get a piece of us  so it was a weird fucking yeah that was a weird deal and imagine if we had gotten out of the xm  contract we would have been on there and they would have and if they would have fucking something  would have happened or the show would not still be on no probably not absolutely not but they  wanted us badly and they had to work around that xm contract which meant man very long days and we 
[01:11:30]  had to split our time and those shitheads they wanted a different producer for the k-rock show than  the xm show it was so territorial those yeah yeah kids they didn't want us in the same studio in one  studio for both shows i still i still tell people we did all right considering i liked that walk  all right the walk over was a lot of fun yeah there were a few of them that are classics man yeah and  then a few that were just a pain in the ass walk in the freezing cold it was supposed to be like 
[01:12:00]  talking it's like i got nothing to say i'm just gonna run and go to the studio this sucks  with more unusual fucking deals in radio some of the really strange we couldn't even we weren't  even allowed to do the show from one place because both companies were so territorial and it's like  do you understand that you guys are both showing your big dicks and we're the ones that suffer yeah  we're in the middle because i was yelling screaming at the time going you guys got to get together they  don't want to talk to each other and figure this shit out there's no way we should stop the momentum 
[01:12:30]  so we can walk to another studio to continue the show it was ridiculous should have done the whole  show from the xm studio yeah whatever and then send somebody over you got a guy you send them over  and you want a guy to look out they just didn't want to hear it he didn't want to hear it that's  why again uh every time every time we do the walker and jimmy would go to the newsstand and ask the  guy for a honcho magazine and the guy's just like yes smiling uncut black inches  yeah yeah that was it black inches black inches right well supposedly that was dave's problem with 
[01:13:00]  k-rock back then because he wanted to do the show from different places he was traveling he said let  me go to vegas and you know i'm hanging with these bands i'll do the show right from there from a  studio i'm all over the place and they were like no you have to do it from this studio in new york  yeah obsessed 6 a.m every day yeah that doesn't make any sense well that's what happened to regular  radio they couldn't think out of the box anymore you know whatever yeah so it'll be good to see  david lee roth i've never met him in in person so he used to hang out at the comedy cell all the 
[01:13:30]  time watch the comics yeah i met him years ago i got a picture with me let me show you my picture  with with ruck and roth uh i'm sure you have it i have one of them to get signed too i met one yeah  yeah i didn't get any at the comedy cell because he was just hanging so i didn't want to bother him but  i and van halen is back together again right they took that time off but they're  in europe or something i saw some shows in australia australia was it hey he's nuts  and they're doing one he's they're doing one in the states so far just in the summer in like 
[01:14:00]  wisconsin some big rock what happened with the band it was a little sketchy and shady when they uh  canceled all those shows well because they probably you know it was ticket sales because they already  did a whole tour like eight months and they were going back to the markets basically right after that  and the tickets were pretty high so i think it was probably a little soft so they said let's just  put it off for a little while and then eddie got sick eddie got this uh stomach problem is he all  right yeah he has to rest for like six to eight months the bowl's even better now yeah what it 
[01:14:30]  begins with a d oh yeah oh that shit is yeah so he so he's laid up pretty much for like they said six  to eight months before he could start what is that like a folded intestine or something it's got some i  think it's a perforated piece of your intestines like lesnar had and depending on level of seriousness  they have to take some out and give you a shit bag or can you just uh you know eat leafy food and  stuff like that and and heal it a certain way like dr steve would obviously yeah diverticulitis but 
[01:15:00]  do you eat that from too much nuts or like too many i eat a lot of fucking almonds which is bad yeah  that's really bad just across the bridge of your nose well then you're just a good boy  you know um yeah i didn't ask what he had yeah damn yeah that's a fucking nasty one takes people  out for a while yeah i can fuck you that's what the queen had and she was fucking the shits those  old queen shits must have been horrible you think you can handle an old queen for 
[01:15:30]  oh yeah if you can have if you can have norton's for it i don't know yeah yeah god the queen mum  she's there just fucking just runny shits in that bed in the royal the royal bedpan  fucking bitch never smiles no she's got the life and never smiles she's a rotten old twat isn't she i  think so the no personality rotten old twat yeah but those brits are always cranky to know 
[01:16:00]  to be any any british uh rock rock guy they're all just miserable and they're cranky they need  a few belts in them before they warm up yeah and they start smiling they're all like that they go  to the pub at five o'clock you know five oh five they're fucking pounding beers yeah if they don't  have their beers and they're miserable you get drunk yeah no one works overtime in england they just  they're nine to five that's right to the bar only america we worked like 11 o'clock they go right to  the bar right to the pub right to the pub and then they go home at 10 o'clock and pass out 
[01:16:30]  we'll do it again the next day jesus unbelievable the stupid um soda ban goes into effect tomorrow  did you hear about the coffee shit jimmy this is we did this whole thing friday you know everyone  was talking about uh you know the sugary drink ban what they're banning the big sodas and all that  and then it comes out which it didn't come out this way when this was first presented no one talked  about coffee it was all about the big actually all you thought it was is the big two liter bottles of  soda you weren't going to be able to buy anymore no the cups cups and then it turned out that yeah 
[01:17:00]  it was the cups then it turned out it's it's everything with sugar in it everything so it's  affected all the coffee drinkers dunkin donuts will no longer put sugar in your coffee you have to do  it yourself starbucks is only allowed to put four packets of sugar in every drink so all their sugary  fucking coffee drinks they can only make it make it in small way and they can make smalls and do it  but then you got to pump your own flavored syrup starbucks has got to figure it out they might  have it where you pump your own syrups and all that shit now it's it's it's disgusting what this 
[01:17:30]  mayor is doing yeah he's a fucking cunt we talked about before the show i mean the amount of people  that this is going to actually help is so minuscule it's unbelievable but everyone has to be affected  how about you just fucking people make their own decisions and again if you want to go after obesity  target the insurance if you weigh this much or if your body mass is this much we will not cover you  oh and then there's discrimination i know that's how they should but they'll never do it that way  the people that are going to drink themselves to death with all that soda most of those people will 
[01:18:00]  never change their ways you might get a tiny percentage of those people you know living a  healthier lifestyle but the amount of people that have to suffer because of that it's just it's just  it's just disgusting wait but a lot like a large latte at starbucks puts like five or six pumps of  syrup in there what are they going to do now like you're trying to figure it out but i thought it  was only over 16 ounces though any cup that's over they have a 20 ounce at starbucks that they probably 
[01:18:30]  won't be able to sell anymore probably 16 they can't put their own yeah the ventis and all that  shit yeah then you gotta you gotta do it yourself and it's why would you have to what i didn't know  it was a sugar band yeah yeah that no one did no one really left field no one really did also  they snuck it in like like they always do they sneak that shit in and now you know first of all  the dunkin donuts thing's ridiculous because you could buy a dozen donuts shove them all down your 
[01:19:00]  face but they can't sell you a coffee with four teaspoons of sugar in it right you shouldn't even  be the mayor no two time this fucking cocksucker did some backdoor stuff got things approved and got  himself elected a third time there's a woman there's a woman that just threw her her fucking big lesbian  hat into the uh ring quinn for uh what is that her christine quinn she well you can't just call  her a lesbian she no i think i think she is oh well make sure you get the name right she  fucking had a little uh statement yesterday that i heard on the news could be the worst voice i've 
[01:19:30]  ever heard in my life this is a hearkening back to like bella abzug uh and yeah her is this it  it crank her up yeah what are we looking for here well they are how in the best possible ways crazy  they are how much they love new york this ain't her hard they fight find the dikey woman who is she  it ain't her then it ain't christine quinn who the fuck is it it was someone and she's yelling like like 
[01:20:00]  and why i'm going to go through every single burrow i'm gonna be walking with you it was terrible  walking with us shut up that old gag can't be her she's a she's like a lesbian or something  that's what they said what happened she might be a lipstick i think i think they said she'd be the  first uh game gay in new york mayor so i think you're right it's her well she didn't sound like 
[01:20:30]  that uh maybe when she's talking out of doors and not in front of a camera on just to raise the  voice a little bit yeah yeah goofy music on is this yeah maybe all right god damn it stupid  fucking the internets you think the guy that tries to search for things will she bring back the big  soda we look like assholes to the rest of the country but now we look like idiots here yeah but  supposedly those 7-elevens still can sell a big gulp any 7-elevens in new york city are still i don't  know they're exempt from that because i don't know exactly why they fall under state law yeah 
[01:21:00]  so you could still go into 7-eleven in new york city and get a 32 that's where all the people are  going to go that's so dumb yeah iraq comment how does this shit get passed there's some articles  after we talked about on friday that oh starbucks is not going to follow the ban yeah starbucks said  fuck it they're going to wait and see what happens in court um there's a two hundred dollar fine  for every occurrence can you believe you can be fined two hundred dollars in new york city  for serving someone coffee it it does it's ludicrous it also applies to pizza delivery 
[01:21:30]  you can't order a two liter with the pizza now that that is so fucking this billionaire cunt don't  affecting people's business he doesn't understand how he doesn't understand you're you order the soda  for the the the fucking people sharing the fucking pizza usually but meanwhile sure you're going to get  a guy that eats a whole pizza and drinks all the soda himself but not so now you got to order a  bunch of different cans then probably cans or that one liter that they but he sponsors the nathan event 
[01:22:00]  every year which just does nothing but fucking promote gluttony right it there's so many hypocrisies  in this uh this stupid legislation there's you shouldn't legislate fucking people drinking soda  or coffee that's it the government should not be in your life so much as you can't buy a cup of  of coffee the way you want it made i thought this was the land of the freak oh please free me we  are not fucking free not even close get a grip they're now telling us how much soda we can drink 
[01:22:30]  in america how ridiculous we're free here to do anything we want are we what a free nation that we  and then you get a fat fucking cunt effeminate prick like that mayor telling you you can't get a large  coffee sweet i want my coffee light and sweet no what happened to light and sweet light and sweet  is now fucking you know the scourge right of manhattan i do like the calorie counts on things  though yeah informing people is one thing informing is fine then you make the decision i was surprised 
[01:23:00]  by half that shit when i started seeing calories on the menu i'm like god damn yeah 500 for a  fucking low fat right and jesus and then you get the other mayors in other cities like well i i think  you know i want to do that and they do it and then they take it a little further you know to be the the  the next mayor that does something that's how we lose our fucking freedoms by letting them get away  with shit like this in the first place just ignore it these i like the fact that starbucks is just  going to ignore it just ignore it are they really going to ignore it iraq that's what there was a thing 
[01:23:30]  on nbc um because new york city loves giving out tickets and making money so trust me they'll they'll  be out in force oh yeah you know oh of course giving out those 200 tickets that it was talking  about see it doesn't really bother me because i don't drink that much i don't drink any coffee so  but the one that bothered me when they did is what happy hours when they got rid of happy hours  right promoted drinking and driving right yeah did they yeah yeah they did that a long time ago they  were like you can't have you know a happy hour from four to six it had to be something they used to  give away like free beat like it was five bucks to get in it was free to drinks from like four to 
[01:24:00]  six nickel beers nickel beers nickel beers used to go out with like 10 bucks and get wings and  a shitload of beer by the bar holy there was clubs in jersey that like from eight to ten it'd be free  drinks it was ten bucks to get in free drinks from eight to ten so like 955 you go let me get me  have uh 40 bacardi cokes because they give you those little plastic cups yeah just line them up and just  hand them to chicks hey you want to drink here after that it was kind of insane it's great but 
[01:24:30]  yeah would you go to those of course absolutely they were like dance clubs they were awful they  played you know but i didn't care it was free drinks and you get chicks hammered you don't  have to pay for their drinks and then didn't they do away with ladies night too like they had ladies  night and then they said that that was a problem because it you know discrimination because you'd go to  a bar that had ladies night and it was just all fighting girls why was it discrimination what  asshole got involved because there's no men's night who the fuck started that shit a  fucking homer i'm sure a queen but a quay a quay enough who would pitch about ladies night so much 
[01:25:00]  good shit goes to the wayside because of the fucking assholes just assholes all the fun that's that's  sad still love that yeah ladies nights were fun you always used to find out where the ladies night was  ladies oh really yeah you go fucking ladies night they're all hammered drinking for free  or they used to have the uh mail the chip and dale dancers oh god they'd open the doors like 10 that 
[01:25:30]  are men so you'd have to get there right from the right at 10 o'clock right right so you were fresh  meat so you can get the one that's all horned up right yeah they're all juiced up yeah you don't  want to get there later no you got to get there right there at the proper time you don't want to be  there like after where there's only the fat broads left yeah we'd be waiting on line you know waiting for  the door to open we'd be like third in line like get running run in there right it was like a  shock of my dad shopping sprees yeah running like you're going for a wedding dress it was like  fucking black friday right as soon as they open the doors oh uh sam you have that clip of uh christine 
[01:26:00]  quinn let's announcing uh for uh new york city yeah quinn is officially running for mayor  the middle class is squeezed in new york but i know i'm the best person working with all of new  york's 8.4 million people to make this happen thanks the 46 year old city council speaker is  taking her message on a walk and talk tour throughout the five boroughs i need to go out  there today and every day and prove to new yorkers that i can be the best person to work with them

[01:34:00]  them a lot of people that were at the show showed up that are all messed up and whoa really lost  people yeah it's brutal really it was great yeah we did it yeah dave david lee roth there he is  what's going on dave have fun take us areas how you doing man pleasure good morning what's up david  we've talked many times on the phone but never in person sir first time in person that's right  but on the phone a bunch over the years and jim florentine in the corner there 
[01:34:30]  how you go dave good to see you too man was listening to you fellows on the uh stereo coming  in on the way in of course just trying to get the whole vibe of the show well i kind of know what the  vibe we just ramble on for four hours it is a familiar vibe it's kind of like breakfast with  an unhappy family first thing we are miserable bastards we really are miserable to be around  you know but there there was a point in time when um i was going through my rock climbing phase and i 
[01:35:00]  get on the bike first thing in the morning and take off up to the rocks up in central park and you  guys would be on and uh really you know it would be you know just babbling about something or  nothing wait what rocks were you climbing in central park that rock is a big place it's about house size  you don't go up you go sideways oh wow you know perfect for my career wait i want to know where  this place is in central park oh it's right and you know where the big arch is uh central park west 
[01:35:30]  and whatever okay going there if there's the softball diamonds that are there just in from there  is a rock is a big rocks about house size and you can get a guidebook with little dots little  do do do do do do little roadrunner dots that work and it's graded you know of like rolling sideways  which you know i'm like basics and i'll never get past i'm a beginner forever so yeah 5.8 or 5.9  whatever that is and it has that marked in little dots to you know going to the left and then up a little  into the side and the more difficult it gets the colors change i don't know what the colors are i never 
[01:36:00]  got to another color i never knew they had that going on in there a lot like anthony  what did i miss what did i miss but david used to a lot like on the skyscraper uh album cover you  were climbing i was used to being a boy scout who had an ex-gunnery sergeant from uh korean war be our  scout master men there's no such thing as bad weather just shitty gear right on the oldest men was 12. 
[01:36:30]  screaming like soldiers out there yeah oh yeah oh wow everybody aimed north good enough always so is  the back of the head i learned the great outdoors the magic of the great outdoors especially in show  biz we make our living like submarine commanders for the interior of yeah you're inside for the  interior of the car for the interior of the building right yeah yeah that or a state's witness  that's what i feel like sometimes so the outdoors becomes you know okay even if it's just something 
[01:37:00]  you look out outside of a window i like being outside but i never did the rock climbing man that's  that's scary as shit well going straight up becomes you know increasingly anxietous if that's even the  word yeah go sideways get one or two feet off and uh start moving sideways and we've been doing that  since we were kids on brick walls that does sound kind of like the way to do it without uh going to  step off cracking your skull open yeah come on i'm not an athlete i'm a rock and roller who likes to get  outside you must have spent years inside yeah you must have spent like entire years where you saw 
[01:37:30]  nothing but hotel rooms limos and the venue i call it i think you're accurate and vaginas  right you see a whole new light on the subject you know but you seem like one of those guys the  little i know about you that you would actually maybe go out and check out the town you're in  i know my bicycles with me and i still do okay you set up you set up a mountain bike but instead of 
[01:38:00]  like where you're hunched all forward like you know like you're like a monkey on a football sometimes  it looks like when you're all just right forward it's an uncomfortable position if you're not actually  in the mountains and we're never in the mountains so you set it up with those beach cruiser handlebars  so you can sit up straight and tall you know and look around like a gentleman and see the world  around you go at half speed you know and then just chill out it's kind of a low rider approach  it's gonna be hilarious so it'd be like i think i just saw david lee roth what ride by on a bicycle 
[01:38:30]  oh yeah people would be like you're full of shit yeah you're high you can trade that you know easily  i've taken my bicycles all over all over the world now you can get a bicycle for 200 bucks  you know so you can you can actually go to europe and buy one there but it used to be  to pack them up and take them with us virtually everywhere you know they used to do that after  tours like he'd do a big van halen tour for like two years and then go like live in a hut in africa  for like three months with no phone this is in the 80s there's no phones there's no communication 
[01:39:00]  the band's trying to track them down and they're like we don't know where he is he's in some hut he'll  be back in october that bicycle i've been living in tokyo since the end of the last tour here which  was like what the last the beginning of last summer i'm sure you don't stand out much there  same bicycle it's the same uh just same get around i get around you know you just decided to  live in tokyo yeah let's uh take a shot at that we've been looking at it through the back window of  the car for so many years touring let's actually take a walk around from the inside out get to know 
[01:39:30]  the folks and do you like it it's uh it's one of the most interesting travel experiences i've  i've probably been in over 250 cities in the united states alone yeah and on my bicycle in most  of them and this is our 35th anniversary holy is it yeah it's if there's anything holy about us it is  that wow 35 years yeah what do you like about tokyo uh the food you can pretty much stevie wonder it  you know and i gotta keep to my crocodile it's like crocodiles each just birds and foliage 
[01:40:00]  it's pretty much just uh chicken and turkey and whatever these days yeah whatever greens come  with but uh you eat sushi i do there's a place in japan the subway that famous guy that have you  eaten at that place jiro there's probably 25 places that serve every bit as good as that do you guys  like sushi you like japanese love it it's really simple and it's not based on how big is the slice  is just how fresh it really is like and that's why the guys are yelling when you come walking in 
[01:40:30]  and everybody goes it's supposed to make it seem like really immediate  it's like when you hear a siren and you see rollers in the in the rearview mirror it's like no right now  no really it makes perfect sense when they're hammering and you know like this yeah also another  thing when you when you come into a sushi bar old school style and there's a couple of them around here  where you'll see old ladders one on each side of like you know behind the bar where they have the 
[01:41:00]  big mirror and they'll have a couple of old ladders and they're wrapped with ropes and stuff like this  and it looks like ornamentation look for it you'll see it you know what those are for no idea that's  old school when you get a drunken samurai who's just out of his brain on sake which is stronger than  white wine and he's swinging around that that uh that blade how do you actually stop him without  touching him they get two little guys with ladders you pin him with the ladder yeah two guys like 
[01:41:30]  jim here could actually just pin him to a little pin him to the wall until he gets a little tired  did not know that but now i'm going to look for those ladders that's when you know you're in a good  place i guess that is old school what's the best place to get sushi in new york that i wouldn't know  i've been out you don't know i came here to find out from you guys what's going on what should i be 
[01:42:00]  watching on the movie screen and what's up with the 32 ounce soda pop that's ridiculous man  could you believe there's a soda ban in new york city the mayor's gone crazy i i understand the idea  of everybody imprinting on little kids what you see walking by i don't know if limiting now people  will buy extra soda pops is that not the thing of course yeah what about 40 ounce beers uh fine of  course fine you could buy a keg if you want and roll it out of the place we don't want to ban  anything but you're going to tell us uh alcohol is not a problem but the soda is more of are you 
[01:42:30]  kidding me issue than soda stop yeah in uh tokyo alcohol is a major thing really and when you go  to the 7-eleven you can buy hard booze and stuff really oh yeah i almost brought one it's uh it's uh  a bottle of sake that's easily as long as half my leg and you see and you put it down on the floor and uh  they have no issues with this sort of a thing right it's got to be 62 ounces of uh hardcore uh  crash your crash your toyota 
[01:43:00]  they don't take the subway right public drinking is fine like walking around drinking yeah they  won't even give you a bag if you go and you buy a beer out of the 7-eleven she'll look at you funny  if you ask for a bag that doesn't compromise the bag though between the police and people drinking  outside wasn't that bag of compromise like you can drink outside we know what you're doing but  it's so stupid because you know exactly what they're doing if they got the bag was it ever  legal i know we convinced each other back in that's all you needed to do dude get it back 
[01:43:30]  and you're cool we just heard you're not cool we just heard from the elders yeah no man we convinced  each other yeah right i remember that much that's a very good question i don't know is that a true  thing like because i don't think it ever was i don't either i have been stopped over by near  st mark's allegedly allegedly and not recently but almost recently by somebody who said no that's  not legal pour it out right because i you know you'd think okay yeah that's one of those great um 
[01:44:00]  what do you call urban myths yeah you can't start hot story you can't start reciting like law  precedent like well of course the paper bag is legal here it is in the statutes and the cops like  pour it out and the whole point was don't do whatever you do just don't bring it down and  scare my horses or my kids yeah so you know maybe it's the same thing with 32 ounce pop yeah yeah  they uh the mayor's just uh i think he's power hungry i think he knows that he can only do certain 
[01:44:30]  things and and look like a very powerful guy and these are them you can't do any real legislation  you know it's nothing that's going to really upset a lot of people real legislation's too much work  that's a lot of work hey the commute not easy stinks you know the price of the tsa is going  up and uh that stuff's hard to handle but soda yeah sure or take on the alcohol companies oh that's  crazy right you can't take on the alcohol of course alcohol and tobacco huge can take on the coffee  companies i don't even think that he's trying to at starbucks starbucks is saying it's one of the 
[01:45:00]  people and starbucks is saying fuck you they're not talking about it like china just launched another  rocket right yeah right oh no i understand starbucks is in the game now  starbucks is laughing at the bad they're not going to go with it right absolutely  they're talking like these are mainly like it's a country just entered the fray yeah yeah but  starbucks says no and we need to hear a ticker tape they're going to fight the legislation they  said that they won't do it they won't honor it until they get fined and it's like you know 
[01:45:30]  it'll go to court and probably get overturned at least hopefully yeah yeah hopefully yeah uh you  guys are going back out you're going back out on tour we have a australian show april 20th  which you know i do my turnaround from here we're going to start rehearsing and um after that we  do our japanese shows which we originally put on home that's how i wound up there you just were  there you figure you got there early i got there a little early for the shows and then it turns out 
[01:46:00]  there's no shows and i said hey the last one missing is the dog let's uh let's get to know the place  the last we heard you were i don't know you made a video in the woods saying that the van helen thing  was going to shut down for a little while the whole thing has become very public in that eddie took  ill he was not he was not right the entire tour and the ups and downs of that constantly you know when  you're on the road it's uh it's unfamiliar everything and having to go to the doctor  and having to go to anything besides what you're doing to play the shows is uh taxing especially 
[01:46:30]  since we ain't exactly spring chickens anymore it's the one word i stutter on you  spring how long ago was that did you have any did you even fathom back in the uh in the uh  late 70s and early 80s anything no could you even fathom that you'd still be  playing with van helen and still be in you know arenas and and and playing the music it was the 
[01:47:00]  plan actually was it really yes the idea was based on old uncle manny who is still with us he's 93 now  and you know the cafe wah okay yeah that history runs really deep with the roth family he's the  patron the the godfather of the whole family still is and uh it was his you know he was total bohemian  he was totally downtown he was getting high in a bathtub with two chicks in 1961 and i can say that 
[01:47:30]  it was always that if you do uh something in showbiz you got to do it with discipline do it with that  you know no such thing as bad weather man yeah yeah just bad gear you gotta have a note of that  in you as well as uh okay hey i have a new idea it's a crazy idea oh i got a crazy new idea that's 
[01:48:00]  the easiest part showing up and and having to drive that wedge home every time you have a new idea no  where to place it that's great new idea now here comes the legwork here comes those the elbow grease  and all those you know how was it going back there for the uh we saw the really small show there and  it's a it felt like it was a really personal and like uh special thing for you to do so was there  200 people there that night yeah um and it felt like you really wanted to go that that small place 
[01:48:30]  and and you talked about like coming down there as a kid and it was really like a personal thing for  you well my pop was just starting school not even medical school just uh college i was an accident  mom has since announced that happened a lot in the 50s  and uh pop was just starting college so every summer i would be dropped off down at the uh  uh right above the comedy cellar uncle manny had a loft which is you know the cafe and the comedy 
[01:49:00]  cellar were the same thing in fact you could spend the night in the comedy cellar was a thieves market  with stalls and uh you could spend the night on one of the sofas or the couches in the cafe  waft for i think 25 cents something like this and uh uh i spent the uh geez the summer of let's  count 61 63 for almost five years every summer in that loft right up above where it's still there  i even know the dame who lives there and uh you know he was the duke of mcdougall right and my uncle 
[01:49:30]  my aunt judy who is still with us she's like i don't know she's got to be 88 years old she's now  good genealogy she's a complete hippie lives in northern california grows her own pot you know  at 88 how is it how is the pot she can enough to completely confuse my uncle dave who's a brain  surgeon from the east coast who can't understand that kind of shit at all in his life so you know  you gotta have you gotta have both right if you're gonna if you're gonna do what she still smoke a pot at 
[01:50:00]  88 oh yeah everybody laughs you know when you know she says it's time to go to bed and that's uh  and you can you know at the family reunions you know it bears a lot of comment you know  when did cafe was start what year oh late 50s like 1958 or something like this so they had like  lenny bruce and dylan and all the guys he came in his first job yeah i know it was when he was uh  what was his real first what was the real name i don't know oh um you mean bob dylan's real name yeah 
[01:50:30]  i don't know uh yeah zimmerman thank you bobby zimmerman i know he mentioned bob mentioned  manny dworman in his biography because manny had cafe finge on at the time or whatever and he  wouldn't put bob dylan on manny the other manny who ran the comedy solo when i was there yeah  he thought bob dylan had no talent and he refused to put him on whoops he actually said no to bob  dylan about the beatles after the first day yeah yeah right that's they stink one of those classic  blunders it ain't the dave clark five i'm telling you guys there's no saxophone yeah 
[01:51:00]  these guys will never fly yeah haircut smear cut wow dave you saw like richard prior right back in  the day at the cafe was a kid and joan rivers really there and i remember seeing uh also poetry readings  there was virgin island steel drums and uh i said to manny uh just this last uh family reunion just  within the last year i said i remember walking in the first time when i was probably nine years  old and there was some virgin island steel drums and a guy who did play goes oh that's eddie barkley 
[01:51:30]  he still lives over in uh brooklyn you want to do well i talked to him all the time  so he still may still yeah he maintains all of his connections on the phone man he's a coffee drinker  like four cups a night and he doesn't start till 11 yeah and you know and the duke of mcdougal is now  the duke of swimming class at leisure world yeah but with that sense of humor and that drive he was  a complete downtown guy yeah yeah years five zero and you grew up around all that how cool was that 
[01:52:00]  all the rest of my family was doctors and lawyers and indian chiefs my pop was a prison doctor for  the last 25 years of this thing wow you know ivy league he called it uh fulsome and san quentin and  was there anything that happened like a crossroads in your life where you might have ended up as a  doctor or lawyer instead of a a rock and roller well we were combat hippies you know back in the when 
[01:52:30]  when uh life magazine first declared you know the the flower children or whatever in the mid-60s  said you know i remember that like it was yesterday we're like boom we all had crew cuts we were all  in the junior rotc doing flag uh whatever where you march with the fake rifles and go to put up the  flag yeah the first time i was handed a rifle i was eight years old and you know i loved i'd still go  shooting at the same time when we were done we'd go sneak some arboral cigarettes that we had uh uh 
[01:53:00]  shoplifted from the ralph's market right around the corner and listen to uh somebody's older  brother's jimmy hentrix records and it was kind of in the same day you know we're talking about  sixth and seventh grade you know and you know just be just as i was becoming a teenager you know so you  never had the ambition to want to uh go into a professional field like a doctor or anything like  that no it was always i want i knew i wanted to be show biz from the time i was really like seven years 
[01:53:30]  old right i wanted to broadcast i wanted to talk on the radio you know i heard you fellas talking  about how our circles almost collided yeah yeah you know i was in radio for almost four and a half  months we remember oh i thought it was only four sorry i was off by 15 days i was just a whole  cbs it was a colorful ride cbs just didn't know what they were doing oh well they fucked you over  man someone like you should have worked on the radio yeah you had a great idea uh a great original 
[01:54:00]  personality that they just wanted to shove into that six to ten radio guy mold that's not you  well there's 90 there's the top 40 mold you know right yeah most of us a lot of you listening grew  up with which is that really hyper static you know it's hopping and popping and popping with the best  bet for the boss beat at the top of the pop used to practice that on a lot of playgrounds yeah but it  meant nothing there's no substance behind that and then and then you would practice um uh fm dj oh yeah 
[01:54:30]  you know which was kind of like uh boss jock yeah here's a brand new one from uh janice  janice janice that's it because i know her up into you know a little bit more modern whatever um  but if you're coming with anything that's different anything that's new then you fellas know better than  anybody yeah you're gonna have to find your own audience and you're gonna have to  it's like chiseling away at a stone from other people's yeah they don't want to hear it they and 
[01:55:00]  and talk about giving you time to build an audience it doesn't exist no hey where's the first ratings  book well get the fuck out see you later yeah it's not working you can't interrupt dave's telling a  great story you can't interrupt them go i gotta do i gotta do the weather yeah we gotta do the traffic  when he's on a roll exactly well we also we they were also like pushing well you gotta have a traffic  check you know one that you kind of have a larsen is designs upon and and you need to have a sports 
[01:55:30]  block well it's you know the familiar diet which in the right hands okay sure but you know that's not  i gotta ask dave though i mean we heard the stories after you left is it true you demanded palm trees  because that story went around the building for a while that you had crazy demands that you needed  palm trees in the studio well what happened was i said after a lifetime of danger and intrigue  international danger why stop 
[01:56:00]  i'm an expert i heard not only palm trees i heard you wanted sand brought in to make an entire  beast let's go to where the palm trees are we'll rent a small but palatial hotel room nice all right  we'll broadcast from there you can put the line in you know we can go on the net etc and uh  i'll showing up is not the issue guys you know clearly so let's let's why not do it from vegas  why not do it from hawaii gee well you'll have to get up at midnight 
[01:56:30]  there's entire communities here there's entire voter blocks within the sound of our voices now we're  going midnight isn't that a little early exactly yeah those radio management they need to be  structured everything has to be structured let's go to the different uh places where things are going  on the boat races wherever and i don't even know wherever right just saying i know there's some  somewhere sure point towards florida for christ's sake you know yeah there's got to be a big rodeo with 
[01:57:00]  a lot of those blonde dames with the you know the big uh boots that with the fringe point west man here we  go yeah yeah oh and in england rugby it's cold outside they're playing rugby they get drunk let's  go and you can you'll find your way towards just not even talking to the drum majorette or the the  chief rugby player but everybody that you're going to bump into in the elevator exactly right 
[01:57:30]  that you're going to collide in every taxi driver if you say to him driver music please sing  if you don't know i'll double your tips sing a song can be any kind of song you want happy right  drunken can be football song i had a japanese guy sing a funeral song that knew everybody wanted to  quit the night early it was too sad it was too you never know what you're going to get right and with  today's recording apparatus uh you know it's an easy approach um if you're a wanderer you gotta be 
[01:58:00]  what was the first sorry what was the first sign that things were going awry like when you were  there like the first time where you were like oh this might not be fun when i walked into howard's  old studio and they said okay well this is where you're going to be broadcasting from where do you  think and i said no you got to be kidding right aren't we going to be like you know on rooftops and  you know ambient sounds and no no you're going to be right here and things were kind of downhill from  there so i started i started to uh okay well let's try and you know create something here that's 
[01:58:30]  indoors palm tree yeah let's bring in 20 potted palms you know and let's uh i love it and drill a hole in  the window you know i got some real air and sounds in here how did we start the our our our encounter  here we start off with the great outdoors guys it just you were responsible for the window yeah  i'm just um you were responsible for the window yes we love that that window was blocked up yeah 
[01:59:00]  when howard there was a rumor howard was scared of snipers so there was this beautiful window that  he had blocked out and when you got there you you cut the the hole back out so we can see outside it's  just a different mindset you know if uh we're actually writing and recording i prefer it to be  like this but a little bit darker like where we are so that you're completely focused on one thing  right follow but if i'm doing anything even remotely like your job and i've got to stay in full diamond 
[01:59:30]  dave mode that requires a sunroof  so palm trees can do this list do the list palm trees definitely  i'm not gonna actually drink them but i gotta see like some mimosa yeah yeah i require different  things a hotel room and 300 is all i need no outdoors i can't picture though dave sitting in a 
[02:00:00]  meeting with the suits after the show and i'm trying to tell them what to do that was like verbal judo  yeah that was such a go-around because you know they they spurred one of the biggest things was that  i was playing too much ethnic music really which was anything that's got a groove to it you know  is uh i don't know if you guys are familiar i know you are mate but uh i don't know if you guys are  familiar with my background i was part of the integrational busing program when they started in the 60s i was 
[02:00:30]  going to junior high and high school it was all black and spanish speaking and um so that's where  the diamond dave thing comes from i just show up with suspenders and you know two-tone shoes and pants  up to my armpits and i go over to the pasadena high school where the van halens were like ridgemont high  and that was exactly like you know the uh sean penn character and the van fullsman that was all deep  purple black sabbath and oh yeah yeah yeah zeppelin you follow and i was coming from superfly 
[02:01:00]  and motown and you know rick james etc so when we began to put the music together you get either  the best or the most certainly the most convincing of both worlds yeah it's no secret when there's no  coincidence rather but all the popular van halen songs are between 100 and 128 beats a minute  that 128 about is about as fast as you can dance before the girls start spilling the drink  yeah yeah yeah even bottled beer you try and go over 138 beats a minute man you'll start spilling 
[02:01:30]  it out even out of a long neck butt but if you stay down around 128 from 100 to 128 100 that's about  al green sort of running with the devil is right around yeah yeah jump is right about 128 sure but  there's very limited spillage and that's not a coincidence that was my contribution  that's some girlfriendly  that's hard rock as yeah yeah absolutely eddie van halen is as solid as american oak you know 
[02:02:00]  it's not longer lasting i don't know what is but you know that sound combined with yeah you know you  get uh you get four tops harmony on every chorus every turn uh you know we had to play the bars we  had to play five 45 minute sets a night van halen is directly responsible for my first foray into  tinnitus which is great just having those big old headphones on my head with jamie's crying 
[02:02:30]  fucking cranked and it's like oh this is great i'm hearing  you can thank david it's like oh that'll go away you can finally go away tomorrow though and then  then maybe the next day did you start taking martial arts because you were the only white  guy in a school was it was like a problem so you started wanting to be i started taking martial arts  because i was the only jewish guy in school of course jewish and white yeah you know i stood out  you know things sort of evened up a little bit but i used to have like one of those david bowie 
[02:03:00]  haircuts where it goes straight up like ziggy stardust and with my big nose at a certain age if i  turn to this side i looked like three o'clock  through a mean shadow  and uh well you know my pop was always pretty he had a great sense of humor but he was always  pretty strict when you know when i asked for an allowance first time when i was 12 he said i  hereby allow you to get a job and uh you know when you have in some point about fourth grade um 
[02:03:30]  you know coming home from school complaining about being teased etc he says i've had enough  of listening to you and on my birthday uh my 12th birthday actually i was neatly deposited at the uh  at the karate studio and i started doing uh wow four times a week well and that was kind of a babysitter  at the same time you know so i grew up in that and that leads up to you know moving to tokyo that's  big part of the reason that i kind of you know redid my whole thing there i'm going for a teacher 
[02:04:00]  certificate oh really that sword stuff okay you know the long you call it samurai sword but they  used it but you know japanese longsword and uh you know if you play ball then one day you want to play  for new york you know if you rassle someday you're on wwe whatever and you know if you start off a little  as a little kid watching black and white uh karate movies and being around that then someday you're 
[02:04:30]  going to go to japan and get your ass handed to you so you get you get knocked around sparring there  oh yeah you know they're not forgiving you know it's a uh it is an island you know that's that's the  polite way of saying it you know everybody else is from outside is you know it's a foreigner outside  whatever and uh man the the number of uh white boy faces that i would see in a common day on my  bicycle you can count on one hand really the whole day and i ride my bicycle everywhere i go to language 
[02:05:00]  school almost every day so you must be very um like if people see you they must know you're david lee  rock from van halen oh yeah i use my smile like a ray gun  all the way across no sighting you're always oh yeah and i i know how to really just slow the room  down easy because as soon as i walk in people are you can see the shoulders come up and i know how to  say you know right away nihongo gaere de sumimasen i mean excuse my bad japanese and if you're cool 
[02:05:30]  look and a nihongo gaere de sumimasen you know like this excuse my shitty japanese and you know  right away they're laughing okay he just made me he's all right yeah he's okay so there's no is  there any paparazzi following you around there's no tmz and in tokyo following you around much too  dignified yeah much too respectful so you know they they read i call it uh excuse me style sumimasen 
[02:06:00]  diet it's no matter what you are bowing and you are excusing and thank you and yes sir and no right  there's no tipping or anything like that so you know that if you're going to a radio appearance  like i did one like this on j wave you know morning thing they they all wait in line the paparazzi wait  in a nice line she and then they take turns like the soul train dance line that two people take a  picture and they split away very organized very disciplined it's expected it's predicted you know 
[02:06:30]  it doesn't have that uh idling drag strip kind of culture quality that we have here in the states  including at the shows right you know here you hear they it winds like there's an idol to the  the noise of the crowd yeah and and you're getting these nice segues from one thing to another  and in japan it's so polite that they cheer like they're watching a ball get spiked again 
[02:07:00]  at a volleyball tournament for the thousandth time it goes yay  and you can keep getting caught with your pants down if you ain't ready for it if you if you don't  know that's going to happen did that mess you up at first oh totally because you're like oh we must  right that roar just yeah we must be we must be sucking because then that roaring yes and at  that and you know at the end of half of van halen songs it those are end of the world endings  you know like put the gun up and everything's flying around like you know wizard of oz and 
[02:07:30]  you think you have to dance and you go applaud just feeling like you survived  and you talk to each other oh man  and you wait for that you would probably know that as a standing comic or somebody you know i've never  done that but you know kind of the tone yeah being healing audience too our audiences consume per capita 
[02:08:00]  i laugh at the term more beer and alcohol than any other sporting event at any venue i check  routinely we sell more beer and more mixed drinks than any other event that comes through any given  arena so so the cheer is extra  even if he's falling down it takes longer 
[02:08:30]  well dave you know dave helped us out as an audience member because he'd go up there with  a bottle of jack daniels right just drink right from the bottle so we're like oh that's how  how fucking cool is that yeah i'll get myself a jack daniels yeah i want to get a bottle yeah  so everyone in the crowd be hammered well we sort of stepped up you know we took our calling cards  from uh the classics but then just sort of expanded on it dean martin would step out with a glass 
[02:09:00]  remember and a cigarette we just got rid of the glass  are you a big drinker over the years yeah you don't come across like that more like uh you know let's  have the toast it was more fun to splash it around right you know particularly the champagne move  which has been stolen several times now i see in the wonderful world of video is uh you take the  champagne and shake that up and spray it around uh but i'd actually seen that in a south american 
[02:09:30]  parade on a documentary as well so at least you took it from another country oh yeah you know  we're mixing and matching but uh you know the whole backstage scene we had heard about what led  zeppelin and elvis did uh allegedly etc so we said well come on let's let's consciously chase these  records let's yeah let's consciously break these records and see if we can uh we stay on the road  forever were you part of any uh scandals through the years what's like the biggest scandal that the uh 
[02:10:00]  especially the american press uh dropped on you though the biggest scandal was when the  are brown m&m's which all right oh that all the rider right you know van hillen rider exactly that  if there's brown m&m's discovered and then roth will destroy the room and you forfeit the show  full paycheck whatever and the pack of cigarettes on every flat surface that was another one but that  was only the m&m's thing wasn't because they were you know thought they were to shit and they didn't 
[02:10:30]  want to they said they're not paying attention to contract if there's you know different m&m's in  there obviously didn't read everything so something's going to be up when we go in there  trying to trip them up trying to trip our contract rider that went along the technical rider rather  was like the chinese phone book it was huge and almost indecipherable  to the uninitiated say that in chinese but  you know to the uninitiated i which was almost every eye back in the 80s you know now today the 
[02:11:00]  huge traveling production the big giant video screen in variety of shapes that's by rote we expect that  out of even the most common country act much less you know rock epics and dance uh you dance figures  who are out there and um then no so we were having all kinds of problems with gear not working  winches not working going up and down you got safety issues and the crew is taking hours to 
[02:11:30]  get outside at the end we're going into overtime which means don't get used to that wristwatch or  that german cars they killed you man they kill you when you went over they murder you for that  the murder we all know that yeah that overtime is not hello not something to play with yeah so  i said for one thing let's one thing we can do to test the promoter is in the very middle of it  we'll just put this little ridiculous thing that if there's any brown m&m's that roth's going to trash 
[02:12:00]  the room etc etc and you'll have to pay the full playing price which is you know how many thousands of  dollars and we just leave it right in the middle and it would be preceded by something like there will be  12 amperage voltage sockets spaced at not less than 20 meters a piece there will be 13 generators  that ipsut5a7s and there will be no brown m&m's or you will get your ass kicked  so if you weren't studying that shit with bifocals all right oh you got your ass handed to you what 
[02:12:30]  is that great fucking way to get them to read the goddamn right and if they asked you what the  fuck is this you'd be like that guy read the contract yeah that guy read the contract  no as you would walk in and there would invariably be um two big women like from the cafeteria in  junior high school with the big bosoms that go all the way down to the tray with plastic gloves  separating from dumped out the bags into a bowl and we're now separating them you know kind of um 
[02:13:00]  what do you call it uh on when everybody's working on one assembly line assembly line fashion you know  taking them out and putting in those those would be taken out and given to somebody probably the  truck drivers or whatever here's the best scandal now that i've done the setup now you know the recipe  let's cook university of new mexico has just installed what was then uh a brand new idea where you melt 
[02:13:30]  down all the old basketballs and you make flooring out of it rubberized flooring for basketball have you  ever seen it have you ever stood on it instead of wood it's rubberized and all it is is melted it  even feels like basketballs you know like this it's melted down and they use rubberized flooring they put  up the stage and then uh said that uh you know said yes we've read the contract writer etc uh there's no  problems and yes it can sit on our new flooring well i came backstage and uh i saw some brown m&ms okay 
[02:14:00]  and so i trashed the dressing room really well the most you can really trash even if given that you  have no time limit could be i don't know maybe three four thousand dollars and that includes lighting  fixtures and you're going to save those for last because you don't want to be in the dark  would you like when you saw the brown m&ms though because you got a chance to do that 
[02:14:30]  totally and you really trash that and you really would trash the dressing room have you ever tried  to do the remove the tablecloth from underneath you've been able to do that i've tried it dozens  of times most people only dream of that right how many weddings have you been to oh i just got to  try this once but i never will you know and how many times do i see a brown m&m and go ah time for 
[02:15:00]  some magic  try and it starts off with that right or you know you see a brown m&m and this gives rise to pranking  which means one of you come in and you sit down and everybody's having a drink  and the lights are low and unbeknownst to one of you i would safety pin the tablecloth to your  shirt that's a good one oh that would occur all right yes and i you know i trashed the dressing 
[02:15:30]  room and whatever we had a show to do so you know the most that i would do there no time limit i'll  say four thousand dollars worth of damage that includes fire extinguisher um the stage though they  really hadn't read and done their book the stage weighed a tremendous amount and that sank through  the rubber of their flooring of their new basketball floor the whole the whole thing had to be replaced  so the headline came out there was no internet then so you understand how things get a little 
[02:16:00]  conflagrated here confusated here it came out that daveroff discovers brown m&m  trashes dressing room and does four hundred thousand dollars worth of damage four hundred  that's okay meanwhile i'm gonna get in the way of a great rumor yeah yeah that sounds like you're  out of control trick stuff right this way is it true mr roth i ain't saying nothing that's all i'm  saying yeah why squash that that's a great rumor yeah they blame the stage on me you know so all i had 
[02:16:30]  to do was sit here and say i ain't never was here and i never was gonna be here no jury's convincing me  different how's the relationship with everybody in the band because there's always been those weird  rumors too no one knows anything for sure but it's always seems like there could be some conflict  there is there conflict conflict because it's obviously different personalities kind of living  together yeah in our band there is constant back and forth and at the same time i think everybody's more 
[02:17:00]  than old enough now to really uh to respect what we've been allowed to do you know if we've made a  contribution that's for you to decide but we've been allowed to do this job for how many summers in a row  yow you know it's like uh we never got kicked out of summer camp usually you get too old like menudo  are there we just kept coming back are there things you guys do to avoid the conflict do you 
[02:17:30]  kind of maybe only see each other when it's time to play i mean you know for uh edward and i there is  a lot of whatever that chemical is in guys that you know we're alphas we never lost it we both are  competitive with ourselves personally to an obsessive uh whatever you call obsessive compulsive nature  i mean with or without an eddie van helen in my life you know a lot of my time is spent with my 
[02:18:00]  head in my hands going come on dave come on like this and still to this day and he as much or more so  then together with each other there is that mutual support of wow am i glad i met you wow we've done some  great stuff together and that also combines with i think you're in my space  oh there's always a great moment on a van halen show especially over the last two tours where 
[02:18:30]  like halfway through the first song dave and eddie will just hug like right they'll stop pretty much  just have a beat in the background and give a hug like and the whole crowd's like oh that's amazing  right right they're doing a lot and then you see him six months later and there's no interaction like  oh boy is this show gonna are they gonna get through this show you just never know well i never do know  i asked i asked that question because uh when you guys first got together was it the same type of  you know when we first got together you mean as kids yeah everyone just got along and so forth no 
[02:19:00]  the conflict was from day one oh really sustained from day one for 35 years off and on oh not a note  out of this symphony's changed not that's an accurate question i i just always thought it it  kind of evolved over time that you guys started having that conflict it's like when i say man i  hurt today people say getting older i see i wish that would mean there was a time in my life when i  didn't hurt wow i've been aching and painting since day one do you guys think band has been aching and 
[02:19:30]  painted since day one and it is that conflict yeah it is that collision that sound and you know and  that here's that japanese shit again in sumo that's called touchy eye when they collide boom you can hear  that all the way across the arena and that's the sound of van halen is that there is a mutual push pull  like you found on all the most colorful football teams and baseball teams you know the reason that uh 
[02:20:00]  people still wear you know that oakland raiders logo you know it comes from whatever city it's in  today it hails back to oakland california in the late 70s you know when they were the wildest bad  boys and the also the winningness and the most picturesque and blah blah have you uh guys ever  thought of therapy i think all you learn in therapy is how to lie to each other a little more smoothly 
[02:20:30]  you know are you afraid are you afraid that without that conflict you guys won't be as  creative like almost like this formula has worked what are we without it like is there like sometimes  i'm afraid to be happy because i won't be as funny does it like that in the dynamic of a band  that's an interesting question let me answer it this way is if you well i've never really thought about  it i i'd sometimes i know that when people do go to therapy and they lose their rage it turns out that  the rage is way more interesting than they are so that would be an actual question um variously 
[02:21:00]  we've all gone through our really sober periods and our really colorful periods and uh you know what it  changes according to where each one of us is in our life eddie and i got along really well for a  period of time while alex and i were at a struggle with each other now when i'm in japan i call it  coffee without every morning i wake up at three in the morning because i have permanent chat like 
[02:21:30]  and i get on the headset you know and i sit on the balcony and you know watch the sunset and i call  al van halen and we plot and plan the daily daily because it's ongoing whether it's website or what's  coming up tour wise or not more than two three days goes by i don't speak with him i probably won't  speak with edward for probably six eight months at a time wow wow yeah and when we do get together  um well i've had girlfriends like this it was new it was fresh it was exciting and it lasted a lot 
[02:22:00]  longer than otherwise would have wow that's that's i like that's some good honesty right there you  you know it's because we are at contest with the world individually and then we are at contest with  each other and it is that push and pull of i can do that i can do that you know it's right i can i  think i can do better than that or i think that uh i have a better idea usually somebody's uh endocrine 
[02:22:30]  system slows down first and and and how is eddie's uh son uh working out he's doing great yeah doing  great you know we had a great uh year touring when we were on the road do you get along with  him though or is he kind of taking his head side no there's not even really a side anymore you know  in terms of like picking the songs being healing's kind of like a great pizza place whatever's on top  it's all good yeah he's a good he's really good bass player too is he really good backup vocals you  know he's earned his spot he definitely has yeah yeah he's well also you know with the three guys 
[02:23:00]  looking the same i feel like sammy davis lee roth now yeah right those three look the same  do you and michael not like each other i mean i mean michael anthony's not in the band is that  because you i heard he was better friends with sammy or is that just that the  the you know that's that is a whole nother camp that's a whole nother uh it's a whole set of 
[02:23:30]  fragile politics whatever's happening with ed and al um i'm glad frankly that we are at the top  of the mountain at the peak of our powers and that the two brothers and i are getting along great  but basically what dave is saying is him and michael and if you don't have a problem no we have no  problem yeah oh yeah okay no and i salute what we've done in the past you know the vocals in van  helen are easily as important as the real section or the production or what and that was him coming  over the top of everything with that high harmony yeah yeah really do you think the idea and with 
[02:24:00]  sabbath now because they don't have bill ward do you think the idea of the original band the original  lineup is more of a fan obsession than it is with the guys like you know we're just guys who know each  other but for the fans it's more important than it is just for the actual musicians let's approach the  question perhaps from another angle does it matter that the original cast of west side story and  etc etc are pretty much all gone do we care and this as long as it's a good production of right side 
[02:24:30]  story does that apply to rock bands everybody in beethoven's original band is dead  he's not he's not in vegas is he okay so so beethoven's gone we talk about this we still go we still  wear the t-shirt when we're in college what is it leonard skinner's down leonard skinner's down  one original member i think at this point raising the question i don't know if i'm arguing we've  talked about this on the air a lot a lot of the bands we grew up with are going to just move on with  completely new members supposedly foreigner has no original members none now but they own the name 
[02:25:00]  and they're foreigner that's so weird that's interesting does it maybe it's different for voices than it is  instrumental is that conceivable look at journey they revitalized their career with the  filipino kid yeah and they're making a damn good living with it so sabbath did well with dio i mean  then after dio and then ozzy came back but i mean they did very well with it so it's like  people do adjust to it but what i'm always wondering about because i love the original  sabbath line right sure and i wonder is that just me as a family wanting to recapture something instead 
[02:25:30]  of just enjoying what they are now well maybe you're thinking about like a football team  maybe something about the team continually draws you back for me it's going to be the oakland raiders for  you it's probably somebody east coast and whoever it is i like that logo i like that identity i like  those sunglasses all about the logo because there's not one original member of the raiders that from  when you first started exactly following him so maybe that's part of it as well i'm just sort of 
[02:26:00]  walking through it with you but foreigner has no original members i don't know but uh is it mc jones i  think his name is uh he pretty much collects the royalties from them touring he gets a certain  because franchise the band doesn't want to play anymore he's like whatever he produces he gets  the taste he gets his taste i'm starting to feel a little crushed like when i discovered there were  four lassies yeah one of them was a girl yeah yeah van halen did this great thing back in the day with  t-shirts they they realized in the venue was charging like 30 bucks for a t-shirt because the union was 
[02:26:30]  getting a 30 cut they're like wait a minute we don't want our fans paying 30 bucks for a shirt so they  made up their own shirts the band and hired a crew to sell them out front in the parking lot for 10  bucks to and you know because they had all you know the guys out there with the bootleg shirts  and let's beat the bootleg guys let's beat the venue inside and they hide that crew they would take  off they make all the money and then drive to the city the next morning deposit that money in the bank  and keep doing the whole thing so you guys screwed out the the bootleggers and the union 
[02:27:00]  well our bands upset a lot of people along the way i think that's probably right pretty you guys  that's a great day have you ever had a threesome  i bet he could say that in japanese hey why uh why did you end up going solo at the time 
[02:27:30]  the band was in disarray you know we were all guilty and uh it was after what album i'm trying  to remember 1984 after 1984 you went solo yep and uh all the usual reasons that bands break up and um  i don't know it had it had a great effect on me um outside of rock and roll you know playing in the  bands i had success on three four more records there two three or more but um outside of that 
[02:28:00]  had i stayed in the band i do question where would i have uh continued to because since that point in  time has been a seriously colorful adventure if you made a movie of it nobody would believe it  everybody would say nah it's just a bunch of guys got drunk and created that story and uh i don't know  that i would have done that uh unless i was the boss of my own destiny at this point in time i've kind  of come full circle and a lot of those yayas i got out a lot of those uh wild oats you know a lot of 
[02:28:30]  crazy ideas um i have uh gone out into the territory and uh come back and uh now i like things a bit more  predictable and with van halen i have that and i wonder if the fellas have that same well a couple  things uh you made a hell of a video when you were a solo artist my god california girls just a  gigolo just how they were filmed i gave a new look yeah that was definitely a new look you were filming 
[02:29:00]  stuff way different than anybody else coming out with videos at the time we're using material  characters you know what my one regret my one angry regret about showbiz as i sit here now is that  i didn't have uh youtube i didn't all right i didn't have google i didn't have i didn't have  you know because we used to have to wait to get to new york to tape record off of a radio station  when cassettes finally came around you follow geez i'm gonna be in new york for a week and a half i 
[02:29:30]  gotta get two stereos one for the rock station and one's for the dance groove on ktu and then set  them up and make sure that somebody changes them make sure the drum tech gets into the room and  changes my tapes i got 220 minute tapes i'm telling you i used to go through this like crazy yeah and  then it was uh you know if you wanted to see a movie i remember i wanted to see the the comedy  called hell's a pop it you know the expression hell's a pop it okay it was a an old black and white vaudeville 
[02:30:00]  just you know comedic sunshine boys or the comics or whatever and uh i had to find a music professor  excuse me a film professor from ucla who owned one copy that he kept in a vault and i had to rent the  certain projector with a certain projectionist and he consented to playing it twice and i had to rent a  little restaurant somewhere in los angeles and all the chairs i had to rent for 20 friends and we watched  the movie together once and then everybody went into the other room and got drunk while i sat there 
[02:30:30]  and watched it again by myself just one movie one time to go through all of that rigmarole was it  worth it the movie yeah absolutely it was great had you seen it from childhood or no you'd never seen  it before i'd never seen it before and i'd heard about it you know like a mark's brothers comedy or  something and i thought hey let me let me see what they what's in there and um i had to go through  all that rigmarole well if nothing else it makes a great story you know sure i had to go to school 
[02:31:00]  with the wind at my back with no shoes so there's no way you gotta love youtube then it's right there  for you bingo yeah right away you know if we're going to the carolinas wow that's shag music that  that kind of r and b like expressway to your heart oh i'm gonna and i start buying with my forearm  in that just pile everything else onto the table and then with your forearm scoop it into a bag  and come out with huge bags of cassette tapes and vinyl records and stuff and carry all those 
[02:31:30]  cassette tapes around in big duffel bags on the tour bus etc now you don't have to do that and it's  like oh my god i can hardly imagine where we would be if i'd had access to all of that kind of stuff  and you're queuing in on video work i was just going off of stuff i remembered from watching as a  kid going oh oh oh you know what if we just move the camera really slow and keep it low like like  they all did in all those uh so-and-so movies or what if we just turn it from color to black and 
[02:32:00]  white i was just going off a memory sure my memory is good but it's short you bring back memories i  remember when you ran into a cool rock station or something and you knew they were playing when radio  where every station was playing different shit now they all play the same stuff but you came across  one of those radio stations and you would just line up your cassettes and just record all day  knowing you're going to find some cool little nuggets in there yep forgot all about that yep  and uh we used to wait from city to city because you knew that there were cities like down around 
[02:32:30]  brownsville texas which is as far south as you can go before you go over the border that's easy top  turf and they only played that kind of really gritty kind of something i don't know what you would call  that but you know it's one basically bass and drums but white boy stuff you know and uh you would get  uh thunder funk or whatever they called that up around the houston area it had brass in it was like  easy top with brass and stuff and there were certain uh radio stations you knew that you were going to 
[02:33:00]  get that you know that you would run into that stuff the only way to get it was just to hit record  actually pull up and be in the hotel room and hold the window open with the tour book and put your  stereo in the window and try and aim it just like really get the reception and then hit hit record  you know and try not to walk too close to the antenna and you're making me remember some stuff  you knew after the first tour you know you knew exactly where okay here's the best place for donuts 
[02:33:30]  here's the best place for thunder funk here's the best place for ribs and here's the best place for  uh disco and here's the best place and you could just go through the whole list yeah but back then  the connections to places were probably more real like now it's all just this thing in the stratosphere  you can pull down but back then there was probably a much more of a real connection to each place  because you could only get this here or you could only get that there so each place meant more for 
[02:34:00]  a different reason now you do travel it's the same shit in every city it's unbelievable yeah you look  out a window you see the applebee's and the friday's the starbucks and the starbucks and a home depot  like i don't know if i'm in for i'm in seattle or we're a block away from time square it amazes me  all these people spend all this money to come to new york to hang out with everyone coming to new york  and they go to the friday's and the applebee's they're not even seeing new york they hang out in time  square like i don't think dave goes to mcdonald's in tokyo i have he probably has because it's a 
[02:34:30]  little different right i'm gonna check it out each this is part of the fun of travel this is a good  point is that each mcdonald's is a little bit different according to the location what do you  get in tokyo in tokyo you get uh it's a little bit of us it's like a bit of a soy taste it's called umami  and it's uh just a little it's not fish it's more like mushroom kind of a flavor really and  it's in most japanese food okay it's in all it's in the miso soup that you order you know and a lot 
[02:35:00]  of the food like in your teriyaki sauce and stuff you just don't know it it's in there and until  somebody takes it out then you go wow there's a little bland today or whatever and they put that  in the burgers in paris france you know we all know from uh tarantino the burger royale whatever but  there's more sugar in the uh whatchamacallit in the ketchup it's noticeably sweeter and if you go  down south into the alabamas in this area like this then the coca-cola has twice as much sugar 
[02:35:30]  easily really so yeah and then there's other places like a lot of salt you know france and belgium they  like tons of salt all over their french fries you know other places not so much yeah so you kind  kind of get to know your way and they did that shit in mayonnaise damn and dave is doing to promote  too it's called tokyo high power style radio show it's on david lee roth.com and then there's the  roth show on youtube.com slash the roth show and i'm gonna ask you uh i was gonna ask you off air but 
[02:36:00]  can we get a taste of your radio show we can play on this channel oh absolutely yeah we're on our 10th  episode and it's exactly the same subject matter but i just pretty much do uh uh a monologue on it  i don't have guests and uh i just uh i carry on about just about every subject that we've talked  about here right but at length sure right right yeah just kind of we'll figure it out and we'll  give uh the listeners a taste on our channel it's part of like a podcast it's in podcast form too oh yeah  video podcast yeah we get a lot of our friends to give us a little taste of their podcast and we do 
[02:36:30]  it on the weekends oh that'd be we'd love to have us today's podcast is huge too yeah i would  imagine it would be we're up uh we without advertising and this is the first advertising  that i'm doing here is coming around talking about it is uh which is what passed about two  and a half million downloads i think it's the same 80 people but but they really like it  huge fan wow two and a half wow and you never say die and you find it at david lee roth.com right 
[02:37:00]  we've said that yes okay itunes.com tokyo high power style radio show yep um do you get to play  any of the solo stuff on on the van halen tours or you have to just kind of leave that alone time  you guys don't play any sammy stuff either that's vh time yeah you probably want to keep it that way  i mean dave's solo stuff i don't know if you're a hardcore fan if he breaks out a solo song every  once in a while that would be kind of yeah yeah look that bandy go win crazy come on actually i've said it 
[02:37:30]  on the air one of my hear that one of my favorite songs you did as a solo artist is damn good  that was on skyscraper i love that song man it's mellow so you know what these are good points  maybe it's something you want us to talk to the van halen didn't uh joe walsh like do uh  i think he did some of his solo stuff with the eagles right right and then that's not an eagle  song is it no nice move opie you just broke up van halen i was thinking this is my disco  hey you know i should just give me the next let's give me the next big fun 
[02:38:00]  yeah right on the ice cream man i want to go in the damn good for four minutes  you guys could take an extended break breaking it up for the ninth time it was  it was nice to see you slowing it down though man as an artist it was kind of cool to hear damn good  you might have a point you know i don't know no no no i wonder if uh we would ever get to that  point where we can start adding some stuff he's gonna call alex in two days alex let's open what  yankee rose well he had a great solo band with steve vi billy sheen and greg this is huge those 
[02:38:30]  guys know how to play their instruments unbelievable that eat them and smile skyscraper records yeah and  you know they were both huge at van halen both of them were doing still doing arenas even when dave  left the band yeah that's how big both bands still and it was very i mean putting it talk about  putting a lead guitarist in a bad spot you got david lee roth going solo that guitarist better be good  you know coming off of eddie van helen came out of nowhere too he had been working kind of in uh  the shadows for a little bit with uh frank zappa of all people wow but that's a musical uh kind of 
[02:39:00]  confirmation sure you know this is more about his ability than what he's actually done in the public  and uh since then he's really built a career did you feel competitive when you were solo and van  halen was doing their thing with sammy would you guys or at least your point you kind of watch where  they were and check it out would you block it out or would you like like if you were having like a  down month or down six months be like bothered that they were doing well and vice versa yeah the  one thing i've learned and that's another good point the one thing i've learned from richard nixon was 
[02:39:30]  never pay attention to your press never pay attention to your reviews it's hard  never look at pictures of yourself and try not to you know follow on to the competition so much  right and i've been pretty successful with that frankly much to my design my demise and my my's  as the case may be you know sometimes i should have been paying more attention or whatever  but um like when i started doing the radio it never occurred to me that there would be folks 
[02:40:00]  competing with me right right how do you know we never really compete in rock and roll you know  okay it'd be nice if i outsold somebody you know maybe for example but how do you really compete  in terms of music you know how do you say yeah you know one record's better than another right well  how do you can say somebody's faster or slower but you can't really compete and in right you know  rock and roll we never really competed with other bands yeah we want to be the one you remember at  the end of the night but you know it wasn't like sports and it didn't occur to me that uh when i 
[02:40:30]  started doing radio that people were going to be competing and they're keeping score on that  competition yeah and other folks were going to be playing games with me and calling in and doing  prank calls and stuff like that yeah guys from the air from the from the same station kind of thing  it never occurred to me and uh i was frankly taken by surprise a little bit when the competition  element between van halen and myself solo really you know sprang up sure and uh i think that was a 
[02:41:00]  lot of our aftermarket friends getting involved that the band and i knew that ultimately at some point  we're going to be back together again you're going to have to give us a star and some cement in front  of some vegas hotel someday someday yeah someday you're gonna have to wheel us all up to sit next to each  other and say that we remember the good old days conjures an image well so it's gonna happen guys 
[02:41:30]  you know so let's let's kind of leave the landing uh landing place uh open there and other management  other agents other band members people got involved and you know it becomes a kind of a slinging fest  in that point yeah yeah do you guys see at least you like you're a very like unstructured guy you like  to do what you want to do free spirit free spirit when you want to be structured if it's something you  like like because you want to you become an ems here in new york like if you focus on something  you have no problem being structured and doing it but it seems like you probably don't like being 
[02:42:00]  told that you have to do something maybe that's why you never got married you don't like to be  told what to do that's a part of it that's a big part of it is you know i can't see you telling your  wife look i'm going to the freaking africa live in a hut for a month i'll see you later no you can't  you know and people will say ah there's names out there like that there are not  as far as anybody who even got my job and kept it this long is uh nobody functional ever did that  okay nobody well adjusted never stayed this long in my job in show business so that being said um i 
[02:42:30]  think what was the original question it seems like you'll focus on something like here because no  no one likes being told what to do but then you are able to go and become an ems or like you said  go to japan because you want to learn to do this and that's that's there's something to be said for  that the ems thing is strange how many years did you do that oh let me think and how many times did  you get recognized as you're trying to help somebody out people thought they were hallucinating right 
[02:43:00]  he's going to give me mouth to mouth  some chicks like i want i've been wanting to kiss them since 82. all i needed was a closed head wound  you were all in with the ems thing you were out there doing it huh yeah for how long i started  when i was about 46 47 and i finished up about a total of about six and a half years really yeah i  reserted three times and uh i did my internship up in the bronx with the 47th precinct big shout out to 
[02:43:30]  all of you out there and uh i kind of made my way around i rolled in every neighborhood here that  would have me bed-sty queens what made you want to do that like what happens where like you you know  you're a rock star and all the city like i want to do this thing this is what i want to do what  happened it was a thought or it just became this obsession well the obsession is with other people  why would you want to be a singer or a broadcaster because you have an obsession with other people  interacting with other people you know whether you're getting along with or antagonizing it's 
[02:44:00]  just there's other folks involved you know as opposed but it's drastically different the two  professions that's what what blows our minds i think right well that's my first job uh you know  i can help trace it a little bit i don't know if i can psychoanalyze myself sorry i can try some strong  drink good luck good luck with that sorry it's just a question you have some bourbon right  i'll psychoanalyze me i think it's fascinating as well i'm very curious i couldn't do it because i 
[02:44:30]  like being in front of people so much the idea of doing something very humble like that is very  different yeah and almost anonymously like people know you but a lot of people wouldn't and they're  injured i don't know if i could do that no nobody knew me i was uh my first job out of high school  was uh working in surgery at night in uh east la the border of east la wow in uh los angeles and uh  in the early 70s you did every job the restrictions like anything else were way different way relaxed so 
[02:45:00]  i assisted during every kind of emergency surgery i worked in the emergency room and pediatrics and  you know all over the shop there um i did that for a couple of years and uh always kept  you know for a long time in van helen i was the only one who had a steady paycheck and then i  realized the girls thought it was romantic that you know i worked in something like that  always the the combination of those two things those two motivating factors always stuck with me 
[02:45:30]  and i always uh kept my hand in you know uh behind the scenes you know as far as you outdoor stuff  you know like going camping and climbing that somebody should know what to do so i'll take a one-week  course you know or something like that and um uh then a couple of things happened that really  quickened my spirit for uh you know putting on the uniform uh the first and probably the most  clearly evident was that after i finished with van halen uh geez on my first album i rebuilt the 
[02:46:00]  pediatrics ward where we used to hand hang out and uh put in a lifetime supply of ice cream in an  industrial freezer for the kids because i used to bum ice creams off the night nurse  at two in the morning you follow the thinking etc um at some point around mid 90s right around  in their earlier 90s it was grunge and it was kurt cobain and i went from jeez i don't know we'll 
[02:46:30]  say 20 000 people to 2 000 people and playing those size venues i never did stop playing but you know you  you will be doomed to wander through the tina turner desert for x amount of years love this  the frank sinatra the emptiness you know all the great artists or the rod stewart uh vastness you'll  everybody has to go through that if you're going to last 30 40 50 years yeah and uh i was no longer  able to make a contribution and that's the key word in my family with uh my pocketbook well i can still 
[02:47:00]  lift pretty heavy things i still have an interest in uh you know getting out amongst folks and that  kind of energy you know something i was familiar with grew up around it you know what kind of a kid  becomes a cop usually one whose dad was a cop what kind of kid runs into a burning building on with a  fire hat on the one whose dad was and you know on and on you know so i grew up around that element as  well and uh also uh in the little bit towards the late 80s somebody tried to kidnap my father with a 
[02:47:30]  loaded pistol whoa and that kind of really brought into focus the combat part of being a combat hippie  was it random or were they targeting him or was it it was uh targeting and he was going to go put him  in the trunk and he was going to give me a call and the guy turned out to have a history yeah he's going  to ransom pop and uh age is an interesting thing in my family pop had just gotten his black belt he 
[02:48:00]  was almost 58 years old he's about as old as i am now but he'd just gotten his black belt  and uh fellow walked into his office opened up a briefcase looking very you know serious and  everything it said i'm from the state i need to speak with you i need to sign some papers there's a  lawsuit or something whatever he went into the back room of his doctor's office in very uh you  know middle of nowhere southern california pulled out a loaded pistol and said to him okay i'm going 
[02:48:30]  to tie you up we're going to put you in the trunk of the car i know that this is the back door here  pop started talking him loose you know verbal judo we call the trucks you know hey relax nurses come  out here burst that door all the time just relax i'll do whatever oh yeah oh yeah wow lights right  off and uh took off out the back door guy gets away pop is now at the house with bodyguards and fbi and 
[02:49:00]  you know and everybody you know hanging around my house now looks like the berlin wall you know with  the lights and the dogs and the guys you know going up and down the uh walking the perimeter  walkway exactly you know which sounds like fun but it's a little scary these are nut cases you know  and this is before there's really cell phones and you know any kind of real interactive media you're  you know you're much more separated yeah you're longer yeah yeah and uh they caught the guy and uh 
[02:49:30]  they put him in lockup in little old pasadena which keep in mind this is the 80s very  different time and place because it's overbooked at the central jail he stays in the drunk tank for  month after month after month right and he's talking craziness this guy's nutcase he's claiming to  people you know uh that david lee roth is a close personal friend but i stole his girlfriend elizabeth 
[02:50:00]  taylor and uh that i telepathically robbed his mind for lyrics and that i now owe him telepathic money  you know literally this all came back in questionnaire form when he's moving from the uh police station  and in total cowboy fashion yes things are different today count back to the mid 80s late 80s  1986 87 in there he's being walked out by two cops from the front door of the police station and two of  his lowrider buddies bust him free at gunpoint wow wow put him in the back of a lowered whatever 
[02:50:30]  and go around the corner and take off this is how this was described to me okay so he's now back at  large the lights come back on the dogs are re-rented  holy  you know you're you know you're now confronted with uh you know uh how to protect yourself how 
[02:51:00]  are you going to arm yourself do you go godfather and just hire a whole bunch of strangers you're  going to sleep on the job at the gate you know i'm sorry mr corleone says nobody leaves the property  we'll get you your groceries go to the mattresses exactly like this um about a month later they  caught the guy again and he got into a gunfight with uh eagle the excuse me los angeles pd and uh  he died in a firefight underneath a parked car losing into that well you know now here comes the uh 
[02:51:30]  the credits and the outtakes when i turn to my dad and i go i'm thinking about taking some shooting  lessons yeah what about you he's going i'm thinking about carrying uh conceal yeah yeah i'm thinking  about learning to shoot anything that comes in black and he's going me too what's really scary is  that this crazy guy actually convinced two other people to break him out of jail that's what's even 
[02:52:00]  scary right like that he's that nuts you figured nobody would listen to him but he had two friends  they're like he found two yeah you know so you're not popular a guy over the course of the years you  must have had other instances where you directly were the target of some you know people that might  not have wanted to uh well yeah threats and invective and you know particularly on the internet or somebody  throws something over the the uh the gate you know but it was those two those two uh experiences 
[02:52:30]  really that just says hey you know what this could be a good thing i feel a kinship with uh all of my  instructors and everybody that i work with there you know i grew up around that in in the medical field  as well as the martial arts field i now have an extra uh an extra desire to be part of that community  after you know my pops experience whatever yeah spent extra amounts of time then you know going to the 
[02:53:00]  shooting range you ever get a concealed carry nope no no don't but uh i do know how to shoot pretty  much anything that comes in oh yeah that's uh so maybe i just wanted like a signed eight by ten headshot  there's a big fan you personalize it to them so that led to the ems control yeah yeah part of it  yeah huh that's very interesting man i guess that's the dance and when you were doing this i want to ask  you too but you talk about two and two thousand people from 20. were you able to kind of keep it in a  positive way like look at least i'm working or it was it like did you feel it was it hard and 
[02:53:30]  embarrassing or were you like fuck it man i'm doing i'm at least i got a gig oh that'll make you look  in the mirror and confront exactly everything you don't want to confront oh mirror mirror on the  bathroom sink you used to say my shit didn't stink you  bitch wow did you ever yeah you'd love to you'd love to think someone handles it more philosophically  and it's like well look at that but you know what human nature is fuck man 
[02:54:00]  dave knows little venues i'm like all right he's cool with it yeah yeah did you ever run out of money  no but i did have to stay working yeah right and stay on a constant diet of you know uh playing uh  state fairs and casinos clubs theaters etc you know what though i do miss those state fairs yeah  those are a hoot that's a state fair word yeah  you know what you get is you state fairs have huge they have stock contests and rodeos and motor 
[02:54:30]  pop sports and turbo pop i call it anything like bog races boat races demo derbies exactly truck tractor  poles you know and what those are celebrations of noise man there really isn't anything to watch  it just sounds great man until something blows up and some little  haste stands up with a football helmet his arms in italian style a couple times 
[02:55:00]  i've been to a couple of them they're hilarious like that you're right exactly yeah you know how to  live you know what you get is you'll get a knock at the tour bus door and it'll be a husband and wife  he'll be dressed like me with bib overalls you follow she'll be wearing something cotton whatever  and they'll be holding the two bags of fresh roasted corn that they picked off their farm  and that's what they want to trade for an autograph oh shit routinely you run into stuff like this 
[02:55:30]  day you know we you know where we run the uh the something shack over there and we do barbecue and  we're here every summer and we do these three other state fairs and we would like to trade with you and  they'll give you barbecue ribs and all that stuff that's what they'll trade for the autographs and  whatever very cool and the sights and the sounds of that when you stand on the stage because you can  always see the ferris wheel and the noise and the lights and everything and every place is different 
[02:56:00]  it becomes uh an adventure you know each place place smells a little different you know and  you get to see things like most folks they treat their livestock like family members yeah you know  you have a 400 pound cow that's laying on its side there and the family is sitting within inches of it  like they're all at a picnic together that's just aunt eddie  yeah they're brushing it and friggin shining its teeth and yeah yeah inches of it like it's the family dog 
[02:56:30]  you know how the dog sits right home and hearth and whatever and you'll see them with prize bowls  and prize horses and prize sheep and whatnot you know and uh it's a whole different kind of world  but the smells of it and the sights and sounds because everybody's cooking something you know you  smell it on some of the street fairs up here like when they grill up the oreos and fry them  have you ever had oh yeah we've tried them oh my god those are great that's pretty good those are  pornography they're deep frying everything now they've done so much and just seen so much stuff 
[02:57:00]  it's it's amazing man i was i was just at what do you mean what i seen i was at the uh the street  fair somewhere on the west side last year and i thought i got room for some dessert and i don't  usually eat dessert and here come two of the biggest fattest sweatiest guys i'd ever seen ever  you rock who are you with 400 420 pounds a piece and laughing and having a great time and i think  and one of them was saying that no no you just got to try this you got to try this so i got behind 
[02:57:30]  them i figured whatever they're going to try is going to be pretty good i'll at least one second  you know what they're talking about clearly so i followed them and they went right to the fried up um  oreos thing what is that it's i call it tempura now but it's what do you call it tempura right  when you dip it's the same size you just fry it that's all tempura is you know tempura is not  japanese no no that the dutch taught them how to do that oh really that's what you do for life 
[02:58:00]  for when you have bad meat or the seafood went bad just fry it up it'll be okay  yeah japanese didn't know that oh i thought they did learning here today  tonight on history for all the wrong reasons  so at that time when you were uh it's also interesting did you ever doubt yourself like  i i like did you say i should change to adjust to what grunge is doing or were you like no what i do 
[02:58:30]  is is real and it's good or was there ever that point where you're like just because i know how i get  as a performer when i see something working and i'm like if it's if i'm not doing what i want to do i  start to feel like fuck i'm not doing it right at that point is a good point at my at that point in  my life i had finally succeeded in sounding like a 70 year old black guy  it takes that long how am i going to now sound like a cowboy how am i now going to sound like i'm 
[02:59:00]  from uh uh san francisco or seattle how am i now i have tried to sing other things but uh in all honesty  i think i agree with whoever said i think with stravinsky so that we just keep rewriting the  same symphony over and over again and then i've got one trick it's a real nice pony let me walk it in  here would you like that stuff would you listen to it because i don't watch other comics at all i have 
[02:59:30]  no interest because i don't want to see what i'm missing and is it like that for you as a as a singer  will you like listen to the newer music and just go like fuck i wish i had thought of that or just go  like i don't want to hear it i don't listen to rock and roll pretty much i listen to r and b i  listen to country i listen to blues i listen to electronica what else am i dialing through here  a lot of spanish speaking stuff reggae on the way home  just uh whether it's whether it's research or whether i'm actually tapping my foot you know going 
[03:00:00]  boo is just as much or more fun than yay yeah you know just i speak to the i speak to the radio a  lot it sounds a lot like that you know i do speak to the television screen particularly when alone or  with the dog you know the dog used to think i was yelling at him right so it seems like you pretty  much we always have like weird bands opening for van halen it's not like docking which would kind of  make sense something like that maybe another hard rock band like ziggy marley bob marley's son did the 
[03:00:30]  tour in like 2007 and last time you guys came around cool and the gang were the openers yes  well wait think about the audience from the audience's perspective for example when i got  fired from doing radio here in the city you know one of their biggest complaints was that i was playing  too much ethnic music which means black or spanish speaking and um what i'd done is i'd taken the  loops of intros from bob marley songs before the vocals come in just looped it for 10 minutes and  talked over so just as we were talking now you'd hear in the background like we were at a cool little 
[03:01:00]  bar somewhere way south of here you know with the palapa and salt water and you know like you would  hear in the background any jamaican pool bar right like this exactly and i said don't you realize bob  marley is the sound of white people on vacation  god is that the best what are we pretending everyone knows everybody knows that 
[03:01:30]  yeah what are we pretending to not know here oh that's great i can say that japanese  she had a knife with his daughter and this guy what are we pretending to not know here  i never understood radio just separating the music so you bring up a very good point there  it is true because i'll tell you a lot of the guys that went to the van halen show last time were like  cool and the gang open like cool and the gang and you go in and see them like they were really 
[03:02:00]  good you're like all right i i know these cool songs of course you know the songs so when you get in  there it's it's not it's not that weird at all right it was what you would go to at the after  party you finish listening to heavy over the head rock at the after party you would expect something  like that something that's a little more dame friendly something that's got a little less  spillage to the open beverage containers you follow something that you have to raise your voice to speak 
[03:02:30]  to each other but you don't have to holler like over an eddie solo you follow and uh cool in the gang  is the sound of white people getting married cool in the gang is the sound of white people  graduating high school yeah and graduating college do you follow what i'm saying right  think about it they've probably sold more records than we ever will they've probably they're played  easily in more venues than we will ever be just think of all the places that you would hear everyone 
[03:03:00]  everyone knows them and it is it's one of those things where even if you are as rustic as distant  to that music as you can possibly be you're you're it's your old lady's gonna go oh oh i love this song  and grab you by the wrist and yank you up out of the seat and you see places where it's just really  hardcore rock audience like detroit they moved all the chairs into a pile in the center so they could 
[03:03:30]  dance and everybody there is you know what's the air we we roll on a rolling stones kind of the age  group now you know springsteen whatever we're in our 40s and 50s and whatnot and um the only thing  missing was the dance lines guys on the left girls on the right you know one person each dance down the  middle but uh everybody got righteously crazy to it and we would just continue to break the drinking  records before the band again yet again it was like i invited you to a house party and said come 
[03:04:00]  on down we're gonna you know we're gonna play some songs with van helen and stuff and you showed up  and for our derives we had cool in the game hey have fun one of the honest things beyond an hour have  fun wow one of the oddest things growing up and and listening to van helen and then learning more about  you was uh what you liked as far as music and what you grew up singing and listening to because  i was always always under the impression well he obviously is a rock and roller that listened to  you know basic rock yeah zeppelin and any of that sabbath sabbath of course but then to find out that 
[03:04:30]  you were so influenced by motown and then it made sense when you listen to your voice and the way you  sang and how you put that type of vocals together with the van helen's uh rock music then it made  sense but before that i had no clue that you were brought up on that type of uh ethnic music as they  say there you go and now when you see it you can't take your eyes right now you completely see it every 
[03:05:00]  time yeah yeah go um also one thing that when i was really young and i'll tell you two funny stories  about earth wind and fire in fact i'll tell you the first one it's with edward and i and you wonder  where some of the conflict comes from is i was always pitching him you know my sisters and i went  through the integrated busing program he went to the all-white schools and i kept saying there is a  great new band you gotta hear them they're called earth wind and fire and they're really popular you  know okay and this is before they became a uh a wedding yeah band you know like you would hear in 
[03:05:30]  in september you're gonna hear that at every farm yeah every graduate yeah i like a bunch of  earth wind and fire songs bingo it is the sound of when you don't tell anyone you like  just fill it in we would have had them if we could have afforded it you know the name came up more than  twice believe me believe me and uh they were brand new it was like 1975 and uh you know keep in mind 
[03:06:00]  what eddie and i looked like with the hair down here you know with the part in the middle and  hands permanently in the pockets you know the boxer shorts etc camel not camel filters crushed up in the  pocket of your pendleton shirt it was we were the only two caucasian faces in the entire form that's 22 000  people 22 000 of our closest friends earth wind has just now started to break international market 
[03:06:30]  but it's an all-black audience eddie and i sit up in the peanut gallery in the nosebleed seats we  watched the show um i think you really enjoyed this show you know at that point in our career we were  talking and so we waited you know because we knew traffic was going to be heavy duty you know we've been  to a lot of shows there for other bands and um we waited until there was just yeah most of the  people were gone we come walking out in the parking lot there's almost no cars one little you know opal 
[03:07:00]  cadet station wagon it looks like somebody drew it against the background it's a cartoon and as we come  up a hoodie african-american kid with a hoodie comes on you know he's got his hand in his pocket goes  yo give me your money y'all and i looked at ed and ed looked at me and i went  and i went do we look like we have any money  nah  eddie has never been to another show with me 
[03:07:30]  what are you doing to me coffee since then i don't know if it's connected  i'd love to think it is well you should have left with the crowd that was the mistake you made was  leaving late yeah right you should have filed out and just walked behind a group of black people and  act like you were talking to them and you're just stuck in the car live and learn no shit did you  guys have a lot of black fans like guys because chris rock was at the cellar one night around that  time just raving about he lives fucking van halen and uh did you have a large amount of black fans or 
[03:08:00]  we got we have a variety of neighborhoods i always called it neighborhoods and we had a song selection  that went to each neighborhood because if you were going to play uh to spanish speaking like if you  had a graduation party or um one of the low rider gangs had a party whatever then you had to play santana  you had to play uh suavecito you had to play a whole list of songs you know that were spanish  speaking spanish oriented evil ways black magic woman you know and you can hear these elements and 
[03:08:30]  stuff like dance the night away those flavors oh wait a minute i taste something spanish  some chiles yeah conyo man you know i spent some time in l.a you know yeah that's not a way  it really does have a i'm so it was through my head i'm thinking that it's kind of a spanish  and it's got the uh the uh what you call the cowbell and so forth that's mixed in there um but that was  a different kind of spanish stuff than when you played for the texano web uh weddings and stuff and 
[03:09:00]  these are the fellas who wear the straw cowboy hats and the shiny cowboy boots to fridays and  saturday nights and that would be a little more like ricky ricardo style which would be like um  jamie's crime  if you think about it that's that's hey lucy  or whatever it's a different kind of groove and you couldn't serve one to one group and one to the 
[03:09:30]  other the bikers out in san bernardino they were all hell's angels you know so you could only play  born to be wild and zz top you follow aerosmith for them that was a little gay you say no no you had to  save that for the venice beach surf and hollywood that would connect up to hollywood do you follow  because they were flashier do you dig and uh you had to have musical diets for each different 
[03:10:00]  neighborhood okay um when we would play black oh man we could we played nothing but uh uh it's your  thing you know we'd play isley brothers we would play um earth wind we would play even uh  casey sunshine band we'd play uh fop that was uh ohio players the list was long and we didn't have  any keyboards or any of that stuff so we had to perfect vocals and a lot of uh professional bsing 
[03:10:30]  during the show so in a lot of van halen songs you hear the quiet part that's in the middle of the  song that's so we can break it down and i can go all right fellas bring it down here for a second  and you guys used to also i want to dedicate this next song  to everybody here tonight you guys used to also do like wet t-shirt contest or knows who's ever  been to a wet t-shirt contest but then you got you guys would do them in in your sets oh yeah like 
[03:11:00]  order sets to kill time there was only one place to do the wet t-shirt contest okay this was very  famous i don't know if you fellas are from are from friends with uh ricky ratchman from headbangers  yeah yeah we know who he is rick's father was um excuse me if i get this inaccurately was a biker  and a mechanic and owned an auto shop whatever for bikes etc in the mid early 70s owned a place called  the rock corporation and wet t-shirt contests were not everywhere they were at this one place and this 
[03:11:30]  is the place that kept getting busted like uh lenny bruce style you dig they kept getting busted  and this is where the case was tried and then it came you know and the deliverance was allowed that  you could have wet t-shirt it was a biker bar and on wednesday nights the van and his cruise was five  miles long i know i don't mean you just you wait five minutes i mean if you sat in one place it would  take you probably an hour and a half to watch every car go by one way and you never just went one way 
[03:12:00]  you turn around at the mobile station and come back and do long slow loops and right smack in  the middle of it was this beer bar it was an old uh ice house place so it was all bricks red bricks  and they built a stage that wasn't much taller than our table here i'm going to say three and a half feet  up and they served schlitz malt liquor by the pole you know like by the pitcher which was the only 
[03:12:30]  place that did that and uh they would have wet t-shirt contest every wednesday night we were the  house band at that point and they would bolt the doors closed you know big fire trap and pull the  kiddies pool like you blow it up you know with air it's like a big tire  and some bikers would blow that up and then pull it in front of the stage and they'd say we're going  to close the bar in five minutes we're going to play one more song we'd play i don't know you know  come on take a free ride or smoke on the water or whatever and everybody would run to the bar like 
[03:13:00]  you know koreans at a mcdonald's and get the you know get all them get their big pictures of schlitz malt  liquor and come back then get to the tables and we'd start the contest and you'd think that because this was  new or whatever that's certain you know that people were you know be resistant no there'd be  20 and 30 girls just dying to get into the contest yeah and they'd step into the pool i'd roll my  pants up you know and this is where i started to work out my spiel you know of hi what's your name 
[03:13:30]  well they do a lot of quaaludes in the valley  i'd make quaaludes jokes for 10 minutes and you're standing in the pool  yeah i mean you know it's they're great ingredients you know no matter how you mix them up they come  out all right and uh i would stand in the pool and interview the girl and then she would of course be  wearing a rock corporation t-shirt and two of the big got bikers you know would wrench the t-shirt 
[03:14:00]  tight as it could be and two more would dump ice cold water and her tits would pop out and she would  dance to whatever segment and what song would you like your i'd like to hear free ride al this young  lady wants to take a free ride we would play it like a radio band you know and do you know whatever  one minute's worth gauging upon the audience glee  and the girls would go through we get all 20 through and then we would have the obligatory meeting the 
[03:14:30]  owners would come over we would talk we would rub our foreheads we would look up look at the audience  i'll go back into the huddle rub more foreheads you know pull air like yeah yeah and i'd come out  and go ladies and gentlemen i guess it's unfortunate but it's fortunate in an unfortunate kind of way  um some of our judges have disappeared they some of our judges are drunk and we're going to have to  run them all through again 
[03:15:00]  and we'd open the bar up everybody would run back to the bar with their pitchers open the doors air  the place out for 20 minutes and then run them all through again okay and we got busted a number of  times for this undercover cops were in there the police would pull up with the wagons out front yeah  you got arrested no we would always be on the band stage and we would wait and say hey no we're  hirelings we're not in you we're not part of this we don't promote this and whatever and uh it went to 
[03:15:30]  court i guess a little bit like the dispensary system in in los angeles is going around it's gray  zone it's not it's black and white it's who knows so there's it's in and out of courts and i guess it  it was it was in the same status then that that is now you know it's it was in courts and i remember  it for about two three years and then finally hallelujah you everybody can have a white t-shirt  contest yeah wow and they started having them at weddings you know 
[03:16:00]  didn't know she're in the end of the world it was wonderful  that was where lenny went to court too that was where that was where lenny bruce got arrested or  he fought it no well lenny lenny got uh he was like in the early 60s i think it might have even  been new york was it new york or san francisco clubs you know he was just wearing and talking about racial  issues yeah same gist obscenity and things like that was always being in the same place it wasn't 
[03:16:30]  like there were a whole lot of fellas doing that kind of work it was just him so when you  talk about white t-shirt contests that's so familiar now that's a part of americana yeah yeah  just like the soul train dance line all the guys line up on left on the right all the ladies on the  left and then you take turns dancing one at a time down the middle and the fat lady will always win  you know about but it that was a big deal at the time that was a big uh routine yeah yeah and 
[03:17:00]  it's so odd something that was considered so controversial and uh um just obscene uh it's  just commonplace now well now it is common think about it yeah what you could see on the uh on the  internet uh yeah no one should go to a bar go to wet t-shirt let's go let's go yeah yeah spring break  stuff it's not even censored anymore you can see that on mtv that's considered a you know even  unless the t-shirt of animals are involved how much ass were you getting house banned in the one 
[03:17:30]  place that can do wet t-shirt contests i'm fucking four girls a night oh it was a great time are you  kidding we there were many times that i would lend my car to somebody and get dropped off and i would  have to hitchhike from cities away i would wake up in some strange girls apartment building or her house  in the back and say who's that up front oh that's my dad oh my god this was a great idea last night  now that's not so much right now got a long way home you know what i still stay in touch with a lot 
[03:18:00]  of those gals really oh yeah you know as opposed to the traditional rock and roll be abusive to your  groupies and now i always treated my girlfriends like gold are you kidding some of them are on their  second and third uh husbands at this point in time they still got dave out there for them  that we get emails in advance of exactly where they're going to be sitting and what they're  going to be wearing oh wow so you're like a saver you now have the whole voter block the stairmaster 
[03:18:30]  nation this did not exist in the late 70s or even the 80s you know you got a whole voter  block of women who are in their 40s and even some in their 50s who look way younger than that  and then you know they've been the full circle around uh getting married and having kids  and they come around all the all the way back around too i want to do what you do  how do you think the husband's must feel though you know oh yeah i used to you know hang out with 
[03:19:00]  dave lee roth back in the day and i'm a plumber now yeah yeah he hooked us up with tickets he's got  to be sitting there like that guy my wife i'm not going i'm just blasting i can't drive 55  oh cruel cruel  fuck him  did you and uh sammy hagar ever get along uh no no  don't define long 
[03:19:30]  well they did a tour together you know they toured together  that's right you guys did do that whole thing yeah the sam and dave thing yeah  there was a collision course there as well  oh yeah yes sam has been i think sam has been yeah i'm not gonna go there oh no we had our  antagonisms but uh do you think it was more personality thing or just circumstantial you were  dave from here and then he was sammy from here or was it because genuinely as people or is it just  kind of you know situational i think it was probably as people yeah again i didn't expect the uh 
[03:20:00]  competition right expected you know that we would go our own way because you know we were we were  eminently familiar with okay the stones have had change-ups though who have had change-ups you know  a long list and people have dignified change-up and i think our change-up was dignified until  various managers and agents and you know a whole lot of other faces or they will  fucking ruin things yes got involved yeah but uh the the end of the story i mean the verification of 
[03:20:30]  that is that the brothers and i get along quite well at this point i'll be it like an unhappy family  but uh you know we've we're never far away from each other you could be in the same room these days  oh yeah yeah yeah and uh when we do rehearse now we rehearse small that's part of why we did the cafe  one is we rehearsed at the roxy club at uh which the stage is not too much longer than what you have going  here and i found that you know as you you when you're putting together the show and you're doing 
[03:21:00]  the routine then uh it's better to have your band within shoulder distance it's a lot harder to hate  somebody from two feet away uh when he's on the another one on the stage yeah jimmy just looked  at me and said no it's not it was at the cafe wash show it's funny because dave likes to tell his  stories and it was his night because he's basically grew up there so usually when dave would tell his 
[03:21:30]  stories the big you know arenas the guys would go off the stage have a beer drink you know towel off but  they had a stand there on the stage you could just see him like all right all right can we uh  all right can we move along yeah i remember i remember wolfie at one point hit his base and  day's like hey hold on son i'm not done yeah it was pretty funny yeah it was a whole different  dynamic you know we we talked about the japanese audience and playing a club audience as soon as you  walk off from that stage the first thing you're going to say is great now i'm ready to play this show 
[03:22:00]  can you follow the thinking you know it's like oh man now that we've done this one thing now i  really know what to do now i know how to set up for a smaller gig or the first time you do the big gig  you know you go oh that's right i got to remember to do this or that this doesn't work or that doesn't  work yeah yeah and uh you know what you were seeing was the beginnings of playing tight we stayed just  about that close to each other when we were on the actual big stage as well as opposed to 
[03:22:30]  just spread out it becomes uh we're we're a club act we're a club band we started off in  you know smoky dirty little clubs you know with low ceilings that sweated and it's gotta be amazing  that it'll look a half arena away at your guitar player to your right like hey what's going on by the  giant pa well yeah you're also encouraged to do things you may not be familiar with doing as soon  as you see somebody running that means they've run out of ideas really the big run like the 
[03:23:00]  the jaunt across the stage the big run yeah you save it for the end with the victory laurel  the big crimson flag and you know the two torches you know and the white horse yeah yeah save it for  the end man  now that's great you see it all the time right yeah you see it makes a beeline from one side  to the other yeah it means that's somebody who doesn't know what to do raise your arms to the 
[03:23:30]  audience that's over there yeah exactly now the other side of the stage yep and then you see uh you  know when when you see a musician completely with their hands in the air all the time in the kind  of a cheerleading thing i call that tits and pets okay because that's what you see  sweaty guys  and it looks the same from both the audience and the stage 
[03:24:00]  about four acres of tits and pets  who do you consider to be a great front man wait let's try wait we can decide this together once i  finish the second half of the idea that when it's all tits and pits that's from the waist up and that's  aimed at a certain kind of audience when it's all from the waist down and little elvis is in the  house tonight then yes i named my dick 
[03:24:30]  and little elvis is leading the way that's a whole different neighborhood  that then you're uh aiming at so when you see for example ozzy ozzy is tits and fits all right now  get your arms up and it's great it's a great way to make a living right you'll almost never see me  doing that for me it's all from the waist down do you think i wear yellow anything for guys 
[03:25:00]  look me in the eye and just  fuck with me man i'm giving you your shot  dave would that distract you like when it's good  i think i wear sparkle anything for dudes  here's your chin  you didn't wear for the guys  nice try you get a freebie 
[03:25:30]  dave would it distract you when i would be at a bunch of van halen shows with girls who whip their tits  out while you're performing like did that throw you off looking at that take you out at a moment  when it was beginning that was great then when it becomes just the uh the fashion then it's no  longer like downtown then it's no longer it's like when the wet t-shirt contest was better when  it was illegal right right you know then it's just commonplace it's there every time something  that okay we just do this like hand signs for example 
[03:26:00]  now you know that that ego thing kicks in if it says well if you're doing it just for me  then it's special then it's unique then it's cool but if you're doing this for every act that  comes through town then i should be able to solicit an even bigger reaction  her tits got stickers on it like a packet crate yeah all different destinations  all the places motley crew is here 
[03:26:30]  yeah i don't like when girls show their tits i'm like they should take her out of here that's  just no reason for that that's right jim you tell me i don't go for that i'm here to have a good  time for pete's sake we just went two hours with daily right yeah great amazing man look at the time  two hours we just did two hours with you like two hours we decided we're not gonna break that was  fast man yeah wow that's great that's super what a blast thank you so much likewise what a  fucking blast have you in here it was amazing we loved it let's not be strangers 
[03:27:00]  one more question where do you call home i mean right now it's tokyo but do you have an actual  fucking homestead new york yeah so i'm uptown so you keep coming back uh to new york i have a 646 area  code okay for a reason yeah yeah i'm on bicycle distance from here yeah that's great man what a  blast let's plug to uh tokyo high power style radio show it's on david lee roth.com and the ross show  you can see on youtube.com slash the ross show and just at david lee roth and it's also a podcast you 
[03:27:30]  can get it on itunes which both of them yeah you get a video is also audio so you can if you don't  have the video you can listen to the audio very cool vice versa and then van halen's doing a date in the  u.s in uh july some kind of festival in wisconsin yes i think it's uh july 20th so maybe some other  dates in the u.s this year possibly you know what in terms of booking ahead of time no i'm frankly  surprised that these happened now i think probably uh they had designs on somebody else and somebody else 
[03:28:00]  got sick or somebody else because you know we're kind of here to save the day these are big shows  these are like 50 70 000 person shows and they're just coming together fast which says  probably somebody else bowed out or somebody else took ill you know so um nothing this year we're  going to be playing europe and you know all probably 50 60 shows outside of the states starting at the end  of this year and then come back around through the united van halen is like you know it's it's uh 
[03:28:30]  it's very pure and uncut kind of music it's lead bass drums and and howling at the moon and uh it's a  little bit like getting drunk on shots of just really good you know kentucky bourbon it's like  you'll have a great night but you probably won't want to see us again for three years  you won't want to see that bottle 
[03:29:00]  with that we got to thank david lee roth i gotta say this was a pleasure for us man we love this  thank you so much sir love it and uh we'll have you back if you'll if you'll come back you bet uh  uh florentine you got levity live this weekend march 14th through the 17th and then stress  factory the weekend after and uh cincinnati collins ohio week after jimflorentine.com  i got uh leno tomorrow and i got uh toledo funny bone this thursday friday saturday but i'm back

[03:30:00]  it's a legendary day it's after opening anthony live i was just molding the future of america just  now a tour from syracuse just walked by and ryan from the mashup was giving it he's also he went to  syracuse and he opened up the door so they could all see i was just thinking you know and he said oh  it's sam roberts he's getting ready to do his show he went to syracuse if i'd been on a tour and saw 
[03:30:30]  that i would have been like man i picked the right school this is going to be great look at the the  future is bright if only those kids knew the truth and they saw gerard butler in the lobby  they see gerard butler walking up and down the halls they see me and they go ah the glamorous  life that that guy must lead and he was once just a student like us no couldn't be if only they knew  roland yeah if only they knew the truth of what goes on they saw jar give me a hug talk so like wow 
[03:31:00]  they think celebrities hang out yeah and they forget that depends what department you're in  i guess so well call us up what did you learn 866 wow one wow 866-969-1969 i learned that uh  sometimes the bathroom the mirror over the bathroom sink likes to tell you that your  shit don't stink i hope you isolated some of the best uh pearls of wisdom from mr david lee rothy rock  um i've got a few are you a diamond dave fan were you i you know what i when i became aware of van 
[03:31:30]  halen was right as they were breaking up but you didn't follow him to his uh solo stuff i like this  solo stuff just a gigolo like i knew he was david lee roth before i knew he was in van halen the only  thing that i wish they had tackled with david lee roth today and i mean that was a great interview  two hours with a guy who does he stop talking no does he have a lot to say hell yes he's done  everything well he lived there i mean during the peak of rock i mean the 80s right he is like 
[03:32:00]  most people most people say oh you got to talk to this guy he lived in like the van halen era  david lee roth was the van halen era when they say the van halen era they're talking about that dude  that was in here today they had the late 70s arena rock scene and then going into the 80s like  roland just said uh with mtv starting out they were there for that as well and it was them they  were the band and when they were heavy rotation it was huge right california girls uh just a gigolo  everything i mean you know you'd like like bands like uh poison and all those like they were not 
[03:32:30]  van halen van halen was the band dave tv mtv almost changed the name of the show of the network  to dave tv for the weekend d tv right john in pennsylvania hey the great prime time sam roberts  tell those kids from syracuse  hey i learned that david lee roth names his penis little elvis where else are you gonna hear that 
[03:33:00]  little elvis little elvis is swinging around in those pants david lee roth the one question though  that i would have tackled after we got past you know what was it like being on stage you know  great questions jim asking him what was it like to go from twenty thousand people to two thousand  people and david lee roth answered honestly he was like it kicks your ass when you really you start  questioning a lot about yourself when that happens he was really honest it was great  i was expecting a guy to walk up here with bleach blonde hair and spandex to tell you the truth 
[03:33:30]  maybe i had unrealistic expectations that's why he dressed for the cafe watch he had spandex on  no he had the what he had on he had overalls on that's not how he dressed well i would like to know  why well he did say he never dresses in yellow for for men all right but you could i don't i'm not  wearing yellow either but i'm not wearing overalls but he looked very comfy he looks very comfy that's  probably i think when you reach that level of like rock idol yeah i'm gonna be comfy if anybody can pull 
[03:34:00]  off overalls it's david lee roth but i just would have loved the question just to hear how he would  have tackled that one why the overalls david well let me tell you something and he would have had  something that rhymed or something to go with it but he was great how did we end up getting him for  two hours um that's it was always scheduled that way he was just like hey i'll stop by how long you  want me for and you're two hours dude yeah because he said um eight to ten things had now do jimmy's  boneyard after at ten that's awesome so he's gonna be on jim's boneyard tonight with 14 that's gonna be 
[03:34:30]  great that'll be on the boneyard tonight it was also really interesting hearing him talk about how  much easier things would have been it it's it's it's good to hear perspective from musicians from you  know 20 30 years ago uh talking about youtube and and the internet and how that's changed everything  it would have made life easier for them but would they have been as big yeah you know what i mean  like if if because that's the problem youtube makes life easier and makes stuff like he said bands don't 
[03:35:00]  have to carry around duffel bags full of cassette tapes to try to figure out what sound they want you  know what i mean they just look stuff up on youtube but at the same time youtube creates so much more  competition for every form of entertainment i mean it's changed everything that everything you want is on  the internet at your beck and call is because pre-youtube like you talk about the concert was  legendary and you just all the stories become myth with the memory was all it was right yeah like what  you what you captured in your brain it's and the story you told was the was the was the capturing of 
[03:35:30]  the bruce four-hour show is always like it was never for he never did four hours but just uh just  people would go oh my god it was like four hours so as a as a bruce thing pre uh youtube you'd hear  somebody go yeah dude he did a four-hour concert and you're asking what songs you played and you  remember all the songs and everything now you go to a show or you go on the website and if i'm  start to finish after the show tells you every set list they just published the set list but you also  half the people who go to the shows don't remember what the set list was everybody's on their phone 
[03:36:00]  right because they're watching the concert through their phone the entire time yeah i saw the frames  and they're performing in the middle of their song glenn hazard stopped and he told the guy to kill  all the monitors he goes everybody was looking at the monitors not at them right and he and he killed  it and everybody started looking at them he goes this is a live concert i'm here you don't have to  watch me on television i'm actually in front of you he got a little annoyed because he goes look at you  guys and he filmed it and he put it up there and you see everybody just looking at the tv monitors  well you know jack white refuses any no cell phone photography at all at his shows oh wow like when 
[03:36:30]  people when people put their phones up security is right there with flashlights and telling put your  phones down and they make an announcement before jack white goes on stage no cell phones it's not  even for a photo or anything and it's not because jack white is afraid that that he's going to be  bootlegged that his stuff is going to be on the internet it's because he doesn't want to perform  for a group that are watching the concert through their phone yeah you know it takes you out of the 
[03:37:00]  moment absolutely absolutely yeah you capture it for later but you you don't have the memory of it you  don't remember what it was like you just remember trying to get your shot centered straff hey uh today  on the show i learned that 128 beats per minute is the fastest that you can go before the girls  start spilling their drinks that was really funny too thank you straff that was that was that was funny  him breaking down the science of how to figure out how fast music should be played he said 128 bpm  was as fast as music can be that a girl can dance to it without spilling her drink yeah now for roland 
[03:37:30]  i would probably say 60 bpm is about as fast as it could go without you spilling your drink 10 10 bpm  doom doom yeah just swaying a little bit uh rick rack in ohio rack what's up i learned that uh  jim norton's gonna be at the funny bone in toledo ohio and i can't find the goddamn phone number for 
[03:38:00]  it you can't just google funny bone in toledo i'm driving oh well then just figure it out when you get  home all right i just want to make sure i get a ticket then okay i'll talk to you later i like  his uncle manny stories you want the phone number or no yeah i guess but what's he gonna 419-931-3474  david lee ross uncle manny stories yeah yeah yeah well yeah dylan and richard pryor when he was talking  about uh living above the cafe wa there where the comedy seller is and that little block on mcdougall 
[03:38:30]  street in the village here in new york city and when you're walking like now that's where bob  kelly does his podcast and so really yeah yeah he does it right above the comedy seller so you're  walking around that area and you have no idea the history that that little block of space has the  people that have walked there yeah i went with uh i got a 14 gym we went to go see uh van halen there  for one oh recently yeah yeah it was i mean literally the ceiling if daily roth which stood  up tall it would whack them in the head so he's singing you might as well jump actually don't no 
[03:39:00]  actually don't you don't hurt yourself it was insane kevin in houston hey guys how y'all doing what's up  who the fuck actually watches another person's concert on youtube i've never understood that and i go to a  lot of concerts i can see video and i will watch the shit out of me yeah everybody videos and i'll  watch a youtube concert video for seven seconds not even seven i'll give it four seconds like you watch 
[03:39:30]  it you're like oh the screenshot looks cool i would like to see whoever bruce jack white oh that's cool  see them live and you click the video and you're like oh it's a shitty cell phone video this is not  what it's like at all and you stop watching you're right nobody gains anything out of watching  those concert videos all you do is lose the experience all you do is lose the actual  memory of being there what's your bruce is your favorite live act roland um bruce you too um 
[03:40:00]  play shelton blake shelton in the frames you're putting bruce and you too and blake shelton on the  same list yeah these are the concerts i i attend the muse is really good live yeah i i said your favorite  you said you too and blake shelton you blake shelton puts on a show that's comparable to you too  differently differently he's coming to here soon is he yeah what do you mean here too serious not this  show yeah i'll talk to you later oh god so i hear your concerts are a lot like you twos eric what's your 
[03:40:30]  favorite uh band to see live weird out i don't go to many live concerts anymore but you're weird  al type of guy weird al was good but um lady gaga was really good i gotta tell you the bitch can  perform yeah yeah and that's another show that like if you put that on youtube it would look terrible i  saw her do a 45 minute acoustic set it was where it was bono did some big charity show and uh but i think 
[03:41:00]  prince canceled and he said i have my my close friend is here uh i just called her last second  she's only gonna perform via piano and he goes uh come on out lady and then she came out and did  45 minutes on piano it and what how did it sound phenomenal i that's when i go wow she could really  perform right and it's weird that lady gaga can actually sing and play piano and is an actual legit  musician so you'd think somebody would tell her to stop all the nonsense like stop all this 
[03:41:30]  bullshit why don't you just sing everybody thinks you can't sing because you surround yourself with all  this yeah like britney spears does like all those right because britney spears can't sing yeah and  the beebs and right and justin bieber can't sing no but gaga could fucking tear it up but she chooses  not to yeah i think she's just as good as like a beyonce beyonce is that i'm glad that you even  pronounced that correctly because you know miss beyonce does not appreciate when you don't pronounce  that little accent on the e she happens dude but you so lady when did you see lady gaga eric 
[03:42:00]  um when the uh the monsters ball hit uh new york the first time when the monsters ball hit new york  are you a little monster before um i wasn't before but you were after i do enjoy her work she won you  over you celebrate her entire catalog i do hmm jack white is probably my favorite act to see live but uh  but yeah i mean you can't is he is he is it a loud show seeing jack white or the white stripes  i imagine that it's just louder than most concerts yeah it is it's definitely loud i mean 
[03:42:30]  i don't know if it's necessarily louder than any other rock show uh and it's not like heavy metal  loud because there's generally you you know what i mean it's not like there's heavy electric guitars  sometimes he likes certain pedals and distortions yeah what he does and i can imagine that amplified can  be a loud show i saw a sound garden not too long ago and it was too loud that it actually ruined the  actual concert i would assume sound garden is louder than jack white is but yeah i mean i didn't  come away from i've never come away from white stripes or jack white show saying wow that was a 
[03:43:00]  loud concert but i like rob zombie is a louder show than jack white is oh i saw that too you saw  when did you see rob zombie with you we went to uh rob zombie ozzy oh that's right at the garden  yeah that was a great show that was a great show even ozzy was great ozzy had the uh the fire hose full  of foam and just soaking people jess was so pissed off she thought it was gonna ruin her leather  jacket i was like look we're on the floor seeing ozzy play the guy is falling apart but he can still 
[03:43:30]  perform like he's a young man why don't you just enjoy it yeah that was the difference in our dates  jess was worried about her outfit getting ruined and mine was uh fist pumping ready to punch somebody  in the face we have she's getting soaked me and eric's wife were rocking out and eric and jess were  worried about their purses being ruined i had a nice shirt on um but rob zombie was great right  well that was the first time i've seen oh sorry second time i've seen him where else did you see  him uh on david letterman oh that's i used to go to letterman all the time right and uh he was with 
[03:44:00]  white zombie and they were playing and they set the fire alarm off right so they taped the whole  performance um they went to break and then when they went to end the show dave was outside on the  fire trucks talking them all the lights were going off people thought it was part of the show but it  was really the fire alarm went off in the ed sullivan theater did people panic nobody knew they just sat  there all the strobe lights and the sirens while they were playing thought it was part of the white  zombie show so everyone just sat there i wonder how that makes you feel about your music when a fire 
[03:44:30]  alarm and everybody's just like oh yeah it's a great song like you know what i mean like unreleased  version right like somebody's jackhammering outside they're like yeah i guess that's an instrument  right they said it was industrial nobody knew while one uh when white zombie was done dave came  over said thank you paul and the band were playing then they cut the band short when the tape went to  black and fire department everything came through the side door saying everyone had to you know get  up and leave do you used to go to have you do you go to rap concerts uh have you been to rap concerts 
[03:45:00]  not since the last one i went to was what was jay-z again with you at the uh the barclays  oh yeah we went to that but before that barclays eric get it right it's the barclays sir charles has  nothing to do with this and um not nothing since the i guess the early 90s i think jay is jay-z is  one of the few rappers that can perform live because i've seen like a bunch of rappers live  kanye isn't great unless you see him if you see him at a jay-z show where he's performing like three 
[03:45:30]  songs then you're like okay but he's either like i saw him at syracuse when i was there he was uh it  was when he was still newish it was big jesus walks was already out but i saw him perform and stage  went to black after every single song and it was just like it completely killed the vibe yeah because  there was no flow to the concert there was no nothing the stage just went to black and then the  lights came up and he did another song then the stage goes to black then the lights came up 
[03:46:00]  or he's taking a pause midway through the concert to rant about obama and justin timberlake a few  years ago my wife went and um she said he came out he came walking through this big like led screen  right that was working with the projection screen in the back so everything blended together did a  whole had a whole huge intro everyone was hyped for it and then all of a sudden he stops dead cold and  it does a rant and sucks all the energy out of the room and then tries to build it up again and by the  the time you're halfway through the concert nobody's really into it anymore because the problem 
[03:46:30]  with kanye west he makes it so about kanye west he makes it so hard to like him you know what i  mean like you like the song you're like oh that's a good song oh let me buy this album oh the whole  album's good i gotta support this guy i'm gonna buy the t-shirt i'm gonna go to the concert i'm gonna  do but every time he opens his mouth and the words don't rhyme every time he opens his mouth  to speak you there's it's indefensibly bad yeah you know what he said that i was reading there's a 
[03:47:00]  quote from him now he says um i am picasso i am steve jobs i and he's running down this list of  artists and saying that's who i am isn't that the apple commercial yeah he's going over i am gandhi  he's running over all the think different uh ads no but but all i could sit there when i'm reading  this quote is you know what steve jobs never did compare himself to another artist you know 
[03:47:30]  picasso never did compare himself to another artist picasso said i'm picasso steve jobs said i'm steve  jobs they didn't run their mouths about nonsense or picasso didn't paint painting goes this shit's  gonna be expensive right right i wanna i don't wanna piss anybody off but my paintings are the  best of anyone's it's like no it makes no sense was it no yeah he didn't do that at all no and steve  jobs didn't go and talk about bullshit he didn't know if he wasn't talking about computers he was 
[03:48:00]  talking about music and what did he do he took over the music industry and then he talked about music  yeah he wasn't just like oh i'm steve jobs so everybody needs to hear my opinion on everything  like he's like ken burns he goes okay i mean he's his ken burns effect so he helped other people  develop their yeah he goes look i like ken burns so i put the ken burns effect in my iMovie yeah not  like i am ken burns ken burns is an artist and i am too i'm ken burns bitch he didn't do it he was  like look i invented an iphone it's a great phone and then people bought it that was what he did 
[03:48:30]  i mean yeah he hyped them saying he hyped his stuff up a little bit you know what was a funny uh  rap concert that i went to snoop dogg because uh throughout the show he was drinking actual gin and  juice and smoking weed on stage and so halfway through the show he was completely fucked up and  it was obvious he didn't know the lyrics to the songs but everybody was like yeah snoop dogg  totally fucked up halfway through coldplay is a fun show is it a fun show coldplay is not fun 
[03:49:00]  music but the thing is when you listen to them oh yeah that hit after hit after hit after you  start realizing one of those bands that you forget how many hits they've had yeah i saw tom  petty at the garden he forget i totally forgot how many hits like everything yeah but tom petty's  hits are fun oh yeah they're good coldplay has no fun songs except for that  that that's the only fun one and uh yellow and clocks so all those songs are cut your wrist songs  those are not fun songs they're sad yeah those are notebook songs yeah but for me they're like 
[03:49:30]  chick flick songs exactly they're chick flick songs yeah people thought you just said chick-fil-a  songs they're chick flick songs oh but chick-fil-a is good too are you that homophobic  not for a sandwich you're all lathered up roland you've been there right yeah yeah what happens  you're ready to shave you got to keep your cheeks smooth right you realize you forget to buy blades  what happened i hope i can't grab them how could i forget you can go grab some blades no yeah and

[03:52:30]  yeah i invented that you're a pioneer yeah i know i'm like a oregon trail you started this gangsta  shit i'm caulking the wagon andy in pittsburgh hey i wanted to ask you about a year ago you predicted  that carly ray jepsen would have the song of the summer so i am again asking the man with the  golden ear right you have a prediction for the summer well when you say i predicted that carly 
[03:53:00]  ray jepsen would have the song in the summer i'm sure what you meant to say was correctly  predicted that carly ray jepsen would have the song in the summer and i did that with the help of my  friend troy who keeps his ear to the street and knows what's hot in the clubs i think it's a little  early to predict the song in the summer right now but i think by april we should have a good  selection i think trinidad james is a song right now oh geez he was here last week wasn't he no  he was in dc oh i tried to get him on the show i thought he was here yeah when i saw on the list 
[03:53:30]  i immediately told liam liam this is the show that trinidad james needs to do all gold everything  you have that iraq uh do we have that in here yeah of course you have it in there it's a giant song  all right hold on gold all of my watch and i tried to get him in here for you but uh  it didn't work out that's what's going on with rap right now it's just the uh most ridiculous  songs that a person can come out with they're becoming very successful and and people are  singing along you're singing along i'm singing along you got it it's called all gold everything 
[03:54:00]  yeah i got it here okay don't give me the remix because he's the only guy who didn't put himself  on his own remix he said like that's the new shit he took all his vocals out well yeah he said  but he just shows up in the beginning of the song and goes i'm so hot i'm not even on my own remix  let's play the original yeah yeah this is the song right now if any of you are trying to relate  to your kids this is what your kids are listening to eric you're trying to relate to your nephews 
[03:54:30]  this is what your nephews are listening to they don't listen yes they no they don't yes they do  this is a radio edit this is the only song i have in the system here  the profit system is still loading the music the lead only had this oh  well i want to hear a little bit of it then i want to hear how they how did they make this  a radio version i don't know  i mean there's so many foul words in this song 
[03:55:00]  oh my god  do you think people actually look all right you can turn it down that's horrible that would be why  a radio edit that's horrible that would be why it's not a uh success on terrestrial radio just yet  although hot 97 plays it in new york you'd think i don't know yeah they gotta play something or maybe  they're allowed to uh let the n-word slip through and all that i don't know i don't know what i do know  is it was a party in here on saturday i don't know if you guys tuned in when it when's rolling 
[03:55:30]  show going up on demand um i'm guessing today well i would hope today because it was a it was a party  rolling came in here saturday at 5 p.m you know two days ago and he tore the house down he walked in  he had like i don't know if you saw it on my instagram i posted a picture at not sam uh he there  were 20 people in this tiny little studio you always hear opie and anthony talk about how cramped up the  studio is roland packed 20 people in here he had a table full of food and booze for whoever wanted to 
[03:56:00]  to to have some he had five chefs in here all just shooting the shit and roland just conducting the  food court he was the guy he was the mac it was the return of the mac is what happened well that's an  old one that's right opie showed up if i was here troy was here opie showed up and opie didn't even get  to go on the air who kid dj who kid from after opie anthony live he showed up and he was on the 
[03:56:30]  air what is this return of the mac yeah now you're just getting excited with 90s hip-hop why not let's  bring you back to college radio days golden era no and i mean everybody loved the show let's go to jt in  new york jt sammy sweetheart what's up how you doing uh first off roland a sleeper cell  fucking knocked it out of the park killed it my car after i parked uh just listening to him well 
[03:57:00]  not really listening to fucking say one word every four hours but still but this is where roland was  so smart he filled up the room with these entertaining personalities that have been chefs for years and  they're all famous chefs and they're all out of their mind crazy unbelievable and roland piped up  every like i don't know 12 minutes roland would pipe in with one sentence and then let the room go  and it was great it was great he would pitch them underhanded and they were just consistently  knocking out of the park that's right really impressive yeah just afterwards let me can we 
[03:57:30]  talk serious for a second let's talk let's talk what is there a pool going on uh uh in regards to  the way dave's gonna be found dead in his own vomit why why do you say that because he's i don't  know if it's a gag but he seems like he's fucking way off center and he's hurtling out of control  well yeah he's a maniac uh dave came in here and the dave that you heard on saturday thank you jt was  stone cold sober i mean that's just a dave every day of his life dave followed up roland's food court 
[03:58:00]  because what happened was obi was here and he was off mic he didn't come into the studio and goes uh he  tells troy who's in the other room troy this has got to go on for another hour i mean this is great  and we had spoken to e-rock and he hadn't committed to doing a show as a friday afternoon  and we didn't see he wasn't there yet he wasn't in the building yet when we saw him so he hadn't  committed to doing this thing so we had nothing we hadn't promoted anything we hadn't scheduled 
[03:58:30]  anything so we were like okay and then i slipped rolling a note saying dude it was you know it was  probably he probably had three minutes left in the show i was like you can go another hour  if you want and roland goes yes i do want and we took a break and we did another hour unfortunately  immediately as we're announcing the roland's food court is going that extra hour eric comes walking up 
[03:59:00]  the hall unaware that he's just been bumped no we heard because he was going to do a surprise show  and he brought uh he brought his friend giddles and he brought pat duffy former intern pat duffy  mvp hall of famer first candidate crazy man insaniac pat duffy what were you what was the show  going to be um there was a bunch of different stuff we were going to talk about you're not going to tell  me oh no i may save some of it for the next time if i do it are you going to do it i think next time 
[03:59:30]  i'll do it you see but you see what happened how did it feel eric to have doesn't pat duffy live in  pennsylvania uh close to it how did he get here he uh he came over my place and then i brought him in  oh so how far of a drive is that for him uh wasn't that far for him to get to my place  still an inconvenience nonetheless how did it feel to show up here and find out and find out that you'd  been bumped for a second hour of the food court honestly it was fine because i i had not committed 
[04:00:00]  to anything i said i didn't want to do it then around 3 p.m on saturday i was like you know what  rather than playing a a rerun of something yeah i'll go in and do it but it couldn't have felt good  with your friends there with you like they didn't care they were just happy to be up here you bring  pat duffy cared okay this is a guy who's wanted to get over for so long yeah anything like every time  he thinks he's got a shot somebody just comes and swipes it away from him you dangle it right in 
[04:00:30]  front of him and he's like i'm not going to reach for it i'm not going to be a sucker i'm not going to  reach for it no seriously dude just reach for it you can have it okay i'm reaching for it and then they  pull pull it away pull it away you can't have it buddy you sucker why would you reach for it why would  you do that he wasn't feeling good giddles your other your friend who we don't really know yeah was  probably sitting there being like first of all why is my name giddles and second of all i thought  eric had some pull around here and now he's getting bumped for a food show oh giddles didn't care he 
[04:01:00]  didn't care he was watching the whole circus of roland show he was just amazed by it who kid was  here he witnessed eric get the bump get the bumper rooney have you ever gotten bumped off a live gig who  kid hell no you know eric man was here he's in there it's humiliating isn't it i mean eric was cool with  it man but that's i mean do you think he really was or was he a little like oh he didn't get called  to get bumped he got bumped on some organic shit he didn't get bumped because he's whack he got bumped  because it was like but isn't isn't that worse like wouldn't you rather get a phone call that says  you're bumped instead of like instead of already up here it doesn't matter i wasn't committing to uh i 
[04:01:30]  didn't commit to uh doing the show at that point anyway but instead of showing up and being like i'm  here to do my show and then everybody's like no you're not they give you the fart sound like  i would think it had to be like it had to be humiliating did pat dovey say anything to you  like humiliated he was no if if i was he didn't want to do it anyway if i had committed to it and  there was promos and everything running and then they did it then yeah i would have been pissed yeah  i never said yes to it so sorry why don't you do it this weekend why don't you take the two hours

[04:03:00]  like white people back in the days we were actually just talking to him about that the black people  liked van van van halen because he was influenced by urban music and their opening acts they would  purposely book to get the black uh crowd coming in there like earth went in fire they had on right  as they were about to break they were the opening act for van halen earth went in fire was the opening  yeah he said that i don't know that but i thought you know i'm a racist guy so i know he came out  with running with the devil so when that song came out i decided to be white right there because 
[04:03:30]  well and black people they don't like the devil i love the devil so you can check my instagram last  night i had a bit oh my god he's somebody yeah i did clinton alabama hey slamming sammy what's going  on i just learned that pat duffy is in fact the charlie brown of radio shows every time lucy  puts the ball up oh yeah eric eric is propping that ball up for him and then pat duffy shows up  and he's like just kidding pat back on your ass did you feel bad that you did that to pat duffy that
