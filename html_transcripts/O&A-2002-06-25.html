<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  It began with a discussion of Jim Norton's upcoming Count Basie Theater performance and the ongoing “WOW Contest,” featuring highly critical and sexually explicit commentary on the female contestants' appearances, both by the hosts and callers including Mike providing live updates from outside the studio.  Foz from the Cleveland affiliate called in to promote the Cleveland leg of the WOW Contest, promising improved contestants or self-inflicted punishment.  The segment concluded with a discussion of "guilty pleasure" music, specifically A-Ha's "Take On Me,"  leading to a debate on the "gayest" 80s songs, fueled by numerous caller contributions and vulgar jokes.  Several Westwood One interns in the studio were subjected to the hosts' teasing.

The show then shifted to a discussion of a meal shared with a guest, Ken, highlighting the risks of food recommendations.  This transitioned into anecdotes about Andy Rooney's apparent frailty and unusual filming habits, including a humorous encounter with him and a discussion of elderly people's struggles exiting bathtubs, shared through caller stories from Stephanie and a nursing home nurse, Brian.  This segued into a caller describing a powerful shotgun, before a substantial segment featuring a call with Ted Nugent.

Nugent discussed his cookbook, "Kill It and Grill It," his hunting practices (including killing squirrels he called "limb rats"), and his extensive firearm collection.  During this call, Nugent fired multiple guns from his property live on air, with the hosts encouraging this behavior and several other callers also firing their own guns.  The discussion included Nugent's use of animal parts for medicinal purposes and an offer to demonstrate more firearms live.  Steve Dahl's presence in the studio and his enjoyment of the hosts' tuna were briefly mentioned.

The show then moved to a discussion about uneven restaurant bill splitting, focusing on an incident in Boston with a $300 shortfall attributed to "Psycho Tim," who ordered expensive wine while his intoxicated girlfriend needed medical attention. Psycho Tim called in to apologize.  This led to anecdotes about stalkers, specifically one targeting Steve Dahl, with a phone call from the stalker, Pia, involving highly explicit and sexually suggestive exchanges.  The "WOW Contest" returned, with further crude and sexually explicit commentary on contestants’ appearances from the hosts and callers.  The conversation included sexually explicit jokes, discussions of casual sex, and dating habits.

The final segment focused on the dismissal of recurring caller "Lady Di" (due to a listener vote of 76.2% against her) and her replacement with "Wheelchair Fred," whose catchphrase "I'm not gay, I'm just desperate" became a running joke.  The hosts' discussion included frank and crude comments about Lady Di's perceived drinking problem and lack of contribution. Marion, Lady Di's partner, was also banished.  The segment included a joke about a picture of Marion in Ted Nugent's book, and a chaotic exchange with the departing callers.  Steve Dahl of WCKG in Chicago was mentioned as a listener.  The show concluded with the hosts discussing the replacement of Lady Di and Patty with Wheelchair Fred and Tippi Tom.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hey, welcome to the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hello.  A couple phone numbers in the New York City area, 877-692-1027, outside of New York City.  Give us a call, or at least write the number down, right?  You're going to need it eventually.  Sure.  866-277-4WOW, 866-277-4WOW.  Jim Norton, already annoyed.  I'm reading this stupid press release that Ben gave me,  and it's really, A, they're always awful. 
[00:00:30]  They're always, they're never written from an entertainer's point of view,  and they're always wrong.  It's about the Count Basie Theater that I'm doing in New Jersey,  and one of the lines here, it says, and I just noticed this,  and Ben, you're going to even notice this.  It lists my credits.  He's appeared in numerous films, including the summer's box office hit Superman.  Oh, my God, it does say Superman.  Dude, it says Superman.  Oh, Dicks, how are you that unaware of what you're writing? 
[00:01:00]  I mean, not that you should intuitively know what I've done,  but read it on the resume.  I went in last night, didn't even put the dash in.  This summer's box office hits Superman, huh?  He plays the wheelchair.  I love this one.  WNAW's FM's Opie and Anthony presents comedian Jim Norton.  His take-no-prisoners attitude.  And dark, edgy humor makes him a truly original comic.  Take-no-prisoners. 
[00:01:30]  Where are those people going?  I don't know.  He won't take them prisoner.  What happens?  They put their hands up in the crowd, and you shoot them anyway.  I can't take prisoners.  No, thanks.  I'm too busy doing jokes, guys.  No prisoners now.  How awful.  Can't they just say he's funny and original?  Enough with the over-dramatizing.  You know, people will be rolling in the aisles.  No, they won't.  Who writes this stuff for you?  I don't know.  You have no say in this.  No, I'm sure I have a say in it, but I didn't know it was here. 
[00:02:00]  Then I'm too busy filming Superman.  How would I know if people are writing?  Let's see.  Jim Norton, a regular on the Opie and Anthony show, is known for his unique, self-deprecating humor.  Norton, a New Brunswick native, still lives in New Jersey.  A, I don't.  And B, who would care if I did?  Who would care?  How does that help ticket sales?  Well, he got to go.  He lives here.  That's true.  He has appeared in numerous films, including this summer's box office hit Superman, and 
[00:02:30]  on television, NBC, Comedy Central, MTV, VH1.  Doesn't say anything you've done on that.  Usually they have something.  They're all uneventful.  And the VH1 never appeared on it.  It was a pilot that never got picked up.  As well as at the prestigious U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colorado.  Where I got nothing.  Judy Brown, the festival's senior producer of talent, said,  he's so brutally honest.  He's very refreshing in a business where a lot of people are phony.  Yeah, well, you know, when you're taking no prisoners. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  Well, there you go.  There you have it.  I have to whore plug.  I'm doing the thing.  Ticket's not even on sale yet, so whatever.  We'll worry about it when it occurs, okay?  That's cute.  Oh, no.  Bad phone right off the bat.  Mike, what's going on?  Mikey!  You?  No, he's there.  His phone just blows.  Mike, what do you got?  Yo, guys, what's up?  What's up?  Oh, I was hanging outside of YSP Studios about two hours ago, right?  Yeah.  And you guys are going to be really disappointed when you guys get some of our pictures. 
[00:03:30]  All right.  It's getting worse.  Call back because your phone blows.  But basically, Mike was outside WYSP,  and he noticed the latest contestants going into the studio for the WOW Contest.  Oh, really?  What is going on with this contest?  How are they looking?  What the F happened to the talent, man?  Well, I'm looking.  Let's see.  We have 38 contestants so far.  Yeah.  We like having an even hundred before we start the weeding out and voting.  We're trying for a hundred. 
[00:04:00]  I think we'll get a hundred.  I don't know if we're going to get there.  We haven't had a girl come down here in New York City in about five days now.  Have we given an incentive prize for today?  They should just come down and represent New York.  You know something?  I understand that, Opie.  But for some reason, they're not.  Just show up, ladies.  It's the WOW Contest.  No, Candy showed up the other day.  That's right.  Right.  Candy.  And Earl's head on Candy's body.  Very funny.  Hilarious.  Very funny.  He doesn't seem to think so, but...  Who cares what he thinks? 
[00:04:30]  I've had it with Earl.  Enough.  He's very upset.  He still isn't talking to anybody today.  I think he needs to be cobbled.  Don't you?  Anyway.  Well, 38 chicks.  And, um...  And four hotties.  Are you saying four?  Four.  Tops.  Let me see.  That's hot.  That's hot.  And two come from Dallas.  I'm already...  I'm only to contestant number eight, and I found four hot chicks already. 
[00:05:00]  Turn it around.  Turn it around.  Who do you think is hot?  Just point.  Let me point.  She's...  I'm not saying hot like, oh, my God, hot.  All right, all right.  I'm saying not like disturbing.  Okay, go ahead.  All right.  Her.  Hot.  Hot.  Uh-huh.  Hot.  Uh-huh.  Hot.  Okay.  Hot.  See?  And that's before that.  And then, okay, now we've got a little drought.  Yeah, there's a big gap.  It's a big...  Go back.  Go back.  It's a drought. 
[00:05:30]  Go back.  All the way to the top.  All right.  Anthony thinks contestant one, two, three, four, and five are hot.  And then he can't find a hot girl until when?  Shut up.  I didn't say that.  Go ahead.  Start pointing out the hot ones again.  All right.  One through five, you think, are hot.  Let me look.  I'm talking about finalist material.  And now you have to go all the way down to contestant number 15.  Is that what you're saying?  And then the hotness picks up with contestant 15, 16, skip 17, and 18. 
[00:06:00]  And then you've got 19.  She's hot.  21's hot.  I just like her at the time.  The Chicago girl?  Yeah.  I'll tell you all the hot ones.  Screw it.  Uh, no.  No.  No.  No.  Parker, duh.  She's going to win the whole damn thing.  Why bother at this point?  Contestant number 27, hot.  Contestant number 28, hot.  Dog.  Dog.  Dog.  Oh, jeez.  Sacramento girl, hot.  Uh, side profile, but when she's looking straight into the camera, not hot.  Uh, contestant number 33, uh, nice boobs, but a lot of cellulite on the thighs in the 
[00:06:30]  one shot.  Keep going.  The girl with the glasses, I've decided, yes, I agree with you, Anthony, hot.  Contestant number 36.  What about your friend from yesterday?  She is awful.  Contestant number 35, Jennifer, is awful.  This chick.  I was reading email, by the way, about, uh, contestant number 35, Jennifer.  Yeah.  One guy writes, uh, it looks like she, uh, washed her face with a beehive.  Oh, Jesus.  Now, Opie. 
[00:07:00]  Wait, go back.  Wait, wait.  You know this is a wow contest.  She has beautiful boobs.  She has great Kansas.  And her face isn't that bad.  It's a little round, but it's fine.  She's fine.  Third, uh, contestant 38.  I wouldn't call her hot, but her boobs were over the top.  Yeah, the boobs really help her out.  What contestant is that?  Uh, 38.  38.  All right, keep going.  Oh, that's it, right?  And that's the last hot one.  And then...  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Hey, is that a new one?  A brand new girl just popped up as we went to the website, opiananthony.com, to check out  the contestants in the wow contest. 
[00:07:30]  From C-Bus to Big Wazoo.  Oh, my God.  Looks like moose noses.  Wow, thank you, C-Bus.  Boy, you guys are representing.  Why does every girl in Columbus have a torso shaped like Stonehenge?  This contest has got to pick up.  We're a syndicated radio show now.  Yeah.  This would have been good enough if we were just in New York still.  Right.  This is awful representation for the whole country. 
[00:08:00]  Ladies.  I'm embarrassed.  First, we need, out of 39 girls, how many did we say were hot?  Maybe 15?  Yeah.  I think it's a lot less than that.  I think we're being kind with a few.  Probably 10.  But ladies in New York, come on.  We need you to come down and show the rest of the country what New York girls are all  about.  And a lot of people are saying you guys are ruining it by talking about all the pigs in  the contest.  Yeah.  No, we've got to start being honest now.  We've got to be honest.  We want to trim the fat. 
[00:08:30]  Uh-huh.  So all these other girls that think they're hot and they're not, they're not going to  show up now.  Good.  Yeah, but that might be that we get no more girls.  Why?  Then there's other girls out there.  They're going to agree with what we're saying.  They're going to go to the website and go, yeah, they're right, man.  I'm much hotter than this.  And then they'll come down.  Well, then come down.  So hopefully we'll have some girls come down.  Well, you guys take no prisoners.  That's our brand of humor.  Our old friend Foz in Cleveland checking in.  What's up, Foz?  Guys, what's up, man?  Hey, man.  Hey.  Oh, and hey, my two favorite scumbags.  Dude, we're starting up the WOW Contest in Cleveland today. 
[00:09:00]  Okay.  It's going to be at the Cleveland Gold Horse, 1438 St. Clair Avenue.  It's going to be at the intersection of 14th and St. Clair.  Okay.  Anytime between 3 and 7, the ladies can go down there, polish up their boobs, show them  off, and I am guaranteeing Cleveland is going to represent well in this contest.  I hope you guys promoted this for the last few days.  Man, I've been promoting the hell out of it all afternoon.  I've been on the air before you guys promoting the hell out of it.  All right.  Because, yeah, Foz in Cleveland there, we can't use the Cleveland radio station to take the 
[00:09:30]  WOW pictures.  No.  So they're going to a club today, and all the girls can show up and get their pictures  done.  Dude, are they allowed to do that to tell you not to photograph boobs?  Can they do that, that stupid building person?  It irritates the hell out of me, Norton, because we're a radio station.  And we've had chicks up here before, naked, and I really can't get into it, guys.  Wow.  Aren't you in, like, the Drew Carey building or something?  Yeah, we're in the Drew Carey building.  Yeah. 
[00:10:00]  Who's the boss?  I don't even know.  It was just somebody from the building that we're in that said we couldn't do it.  All right, Foz.  But I know that you guys were disappointed in the Naughty Nutty Girls that we had last  time.  I was disappointed.  They were awful.  Last time, guys.  They stunk.  I am guaranteeing, if not, if the girls don't represent well, and they don't blow out the  girls from the Naughty Nutty contest, and they don't blow out the girls that are on the  website now.  I mean, you got some girl from Sacramento that looks like a 12-year-old boy. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah, but none of the other ones are hot, though.  It looks like my grandmother went to Columbus and took pictures.  So, if they don't represent, I am going to come to New York, and for every girl that  enters from Cleveland, I'm going to let you guys drill staples into me.  Nice.  Hey.  All right.  So, if girls from Cleveland do not represent...  Hold on, Foz.  We're going to take you up on that.  All right, dude.  For every pig from Cleveland that ends up in this contest, you're taking a staple, bro.  Not just the pigs.  Even if there's hot chicks and you guys are disappointed, I'll take a staple for every girl that represents 
[00:11:00]  from Cleveland.  No, we'll be fair.  We'll have the listeners decide how many staples you're going to have to take.  All right?  You got it, man.  All right.  Good luck today, bro.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Now, I hope all the pigs show up.  Building manager really annoys me.  Hey, Bobby, what's going on?  Obi.  Yeah.  Are you that stupid of what you're saying?  What?  You're telling all the girls, don't even bother because that girl, Parker, is so hot?  Of course the girls aren't going to show up because they're going to lose.  Well, I'm trying to push them a little bit by saying Parker's going to win it all because 
[00:11:30]  then you're going to get a bunch of hotties out there going, oh, yeah, no, I could be  Parker and I'm coming down to the station today to get my pictures done.  Well, I understand that girl Parker's hot, but just don't say, oh, yeah, she's going to  win the whole damn thing.  You have to get some motivation to some of these girls saying, oh, yeah, she's not going  to win it.  Hey, Bobby, no one listens to us anyway because in the last contest we said the chick from Sacramento  was going to win the whole thing and she lost to Stephanie in D.C., so.  All right, guys.  It's not going to be up to us in the end.  I'm just saying Parker's off the hook so far.  I know she's off the hook, but I hope that you get some other hot-looking chicks coming 
[00:12:00]  down.  All right.  Thank you, Bobby.  All right, guys.  Yeah, we're on a very cold streak with this WOW Contest.  Yeah.  Kenny.  Yo.  What's up?  What's the good word?  Hey.  Listen, I think you should just show the boobs in the pictures instead of the face.  Throwing everyone off.  I think if the girls want to show their faces, that's fine.  It can help them.  You guys are talking about celluloy on the legs and you're looking at a WOW Contest. 
[00:12:30]  The WOW thing, it's the whole picture, you know what I mean?  The whole thing.  That's why it's not just a one shot of the boobs.  It's not a best breast contest.  It's a best WOW Contest.  Wow-er.  So when you're being wowed, there are good wows.  There are bad wows.  Right.  A girl may have nice boobs, but then she has a really nice face on top.  And you're going to be like, WOW!  Right.  I got you.  You know, it's not just a, it's really not just a breast contest.  If you think about it. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, I didn't understand.  I can't.  I guess I'll go to eatavolt.com and deal with it.  Thank you.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Mike's calling back on a better phone.  What's up, Mike?  Yo, guys.  What's up, man?  Hey.  Sorry about that connection earlier.  Um, I just want to explain this one chick that walked into YSP for you guys.  Okay.  Just so, uh, everybody else can share in my disgust.  Uh, the one chick, she, she had real skinny legs.  She walked up, she had a real huge stomach.  That's like, kind of popping out.  She had the spandex type to kind of hide it.  Yeah.  And her cans are nice and big, but they're hanging on her stomach and they're holding them 
[00:13:30]  up.  So, kind of makes you want to throw up.  Not looking too good for Philadelphia.  The cans are sitting on her stomach?  Yeah, they're hanging on her stomach.  It's pretty bad.  It's almost as bad as the Philadelphia Phillies.  I don't know what happened with Philly, man.  I'm telling you, man.  We're falling apart.  Philly, I mean, Philly is not representing in this contest.  No.  Um, I have a question for Jim at his, uh, website.  No, you don't.  Mike.  Jim.  No, no.  You're never going to get me like that.  Ever.  I'm so good.  I bitch too rapidly.  I have a question for Jim. 
[00:14:00]  Oh, come on.  This works.  Jesus is going to go for it.  I'm going to get him.  I'm finally going to get him.  Yeah, dude, commit to the question.  Hey, Jim, why isn't the website working?  What do you mean?  Click.  Then you get me.  Don't set me up that easy, you silly goose.  I take no prisoners.  Elbow, elbow.  Jim, I have a question for you.  Are you willing to accept said question?  And you can almost hear him going, I think he's going to say what.  He's going to accept the question.  Watch him accept the question.  That was truly heinous, sir.  Hey, Tom, what's going on? 
[00:14:30]  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey, man.  Columbus.  Awful.  No representation whatsoever.  I'm here in Columbus, college town.  Tons of hotties.  Contestant 39.  Nothing about cake going to the wazoo.  I think we could all agree we could all laugh at Columbus today.  Is that what we're doing as a nation?  Oh, Columbus.  We can all just chuckle at Columbus.  The Columbus girls representing are just the worst.  Do they have any other ones?  Not only are they fat, but bad tattoos on top of them.  All right.  Well, good luck to you in the contest there. 
[00:15:00]  Yeah.  Woo.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  That other one, the one with the, as you said, the tattoo is eating, the belly button is eating her tattoo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's from Columbus.  You should never get a tattoo around your belly button when you're thin and then gain weight.  It never looks good.  Your belly button will eat the tattoo.  That's right.  Hey, Bill.  What's up?  Hey, I wanted to know where you guys got your math with 10 cute girls in this contest.  I was just throwing out a number.  I was being nice. 
[00:15:30]  Why?  Who do you think?  It's looking more like you got about 95 contestants until we have a contest.  You only think there's five, you said?  Yeah.  I mean, you guys are a national radio show.  Show some respect, you know?  A little class.  Some of these girls are dogs.  A little class.  We're trying, man.  The cities are letting us down.  Philly.  Who would think Philly would let us down?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anybody that doesn't live in Philly?  We're practically brothers with Philly, and they're letting us down here.  Oh, that really sucks.  All right, man.  All right. 
[00:16:00]  Bye.  Yeah.  Enough with that.  It's the WOW Contest.  It's going on.  Ladies, show up at the radio station.  Get your pictures done.  Don't let us scare you.  Yeah.  We're just kind of having fun.  Just funning.  Come on down.  Yeah.  Come on down.  You'll enjoy it.  And you'll have a good time just coming down here.  That's what I hear.  I hear any of the girls come down and have their pictures taken.  It's very cordial.  Very nice.  Although, it is unfortunate that our prized photographer, Rick, Mr. Rick, as they call him 
[00:16:30]  in the business, isn't here to take the pictures.  Right now, he's in Europe.  And right about now, A-Ha is playing their hit, Take On Me.  Rick's supposed to call us from the concert, by the way.  Is he?  When they start playing Take On Me.  I want to hear it over his cell phone.  And ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,  ding, ding, ding.  We should talk about Rick and how pussy whipped he is now that he's not here and he's overseas  with his wife.  This is the ultimate pussy whip.  His wife is a huge A-ha fan.  You remember A-ha, Take On Me. 
[00:17:00]  Wait a minute, I'm not going to lie.  When the song came out, I was like, yeah, cool.  It's a cool little song.  No, it wasn't.  For the 80s, it wasn't bad.  It was a catchy little ditty.  It wasn't.  Get the stupid song.  Get the song now.  No, it wasn't catchy.  It was simple and catchy.  Take On Me stunk.  I have always hated it.  You really did it in the 80s?  What was the video?  Was that the one with the drawing?  The drawing is like a comic strip.  And it was like pencil drawings.  And it was done very well.  It was very innovative for its time, the video. 
[00:17:30]  You know, the song was pretty much what was going on back then anyway.  But it was catchy.  It had to be.  It was being played everywhere.  It was one of those songs.  You know what else is catchy?  Rock and Roll McDonald's.  But I'm not going to sit here in 20 years and go, wow, it was pretty good.  I know.  It's catchy.  It's horrendous.  No, it was at the time.  That was a very popular song.  You're right.  You're absolutely right.  And it was catchy.  I believe it's called a guilty pleasure. 
[00:18:00]  Right.  Guilty pleasure.  Guilty pleasure for me to listen to Aha, Take On Me, in the wonderful, play the Madison  Square Garden back in the, Take On Me, Take On Me, Take Me On, Take On Me.  Jamie, do you have any guilty pleasures as far as music goes?  Any guilty pleasures?  Yeah.  Yeah, I absolutely do.  I have some, Mike, Mike downloaded stuff from like, you know, like the sites like Napster  and Kazan.  Dude, you made me throw in a Neil Diamond CD.  Yeah, I like Neil Diamond. 
[00:18:30]  Lil Von the Rocks.  No, he likes, what was that song you liked?  I happen to be a big fan of David Cassidy's, I Think I Love You.  That's a very good song.  Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's a good song.  Aha, Sticks.  And right in the middle of a wet dream, and all at once I wake up.  Exactly.  You like that one?  Yeah.  That's catchy.  Sweet Caroline.  Who doesn't?  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  I'm trying to find out.  Take On Me is just, just.  In real, Take On Me wasn't that bad. 
[00:19:00]  It was a very big 80s sound is what it was.  But what I'm trying to say is, 20 years later, I wouldn't be going to Europe to, you know,  check out A-Ha concert.  There's the rub.  You're a real fag where you actually have to show a passport to see A-Ha.  Well, yeah, Rick's wife, a very, very big fan of A-Ha.  I guess they never broke up.  They continued to put out albums, and she's really into it.  But, of course, they can't play here in the States because no one would go see them. 
[00:19:30]  But, again, Europe and England, there are a bunch of weirdos over there that still grab  on to the metal bands and the old 80s bands, and they show up at these concerts like it's  something brand new.  So, Rick, being the pussy-whipped guy he is, got on a plane, went to England for the sole  purpose to see A-Ha.  What other song did A-Ha do? 
[00:20:00]  In a sold-out stadium, by the way.  Anything?  Any other tune?  England.  Oh, of course.  Supposedly, they're huge in England.  Doesn't that just figure that stupid country?  It just absolutely figures.  They're kind of behind the times.  Kind of?  They don't think A-Ha is sold out.  Oh, there it is, Jimmy.  Listen.  He's dancing.  Jimmy's dancing.  You didn't like the... 
[00:20:30]  Can't you see all the girls dancing with their big, tall, neon-colored boots?  The headband?  The 80s clothes?  I see fat pigs tucking their jeans into their socks.  I like the little dress that has the lace dress over it kind of look.  It kind of looks a little torn.  Don't get away.  It's Rick right now.  I don't know what I'm about to say.  I'll say it anyway.  Come on.  You know, Jim, never in the car.  Maybe this came on. 
[00:21:00]  When you're listening to this, you can have an acid-washed condom break and a man inspect you.  Come on.  Everyone, sing along, Jim.  Terrible.  No?  No.  This was very popular.  Yeah.  Oh, here comes a part.  Here comes a part.  This is where he takes it.  Great stuff.  And here's Rick from England.  I'm on the phone.  Rick!  I'm a faggot. 
[00:21:30]  I was a faggot.  I was two years old.  Wow.  Wow.  What happened?  Rick, how's the A-Ha show?  Now, you don't like queers?  Don't you say it?  No, not at all.  Watch out.  Don't catch the AIDS.  I'm sure there's a lot of gay men going to do that.  You don't die of AIDS!  I'm sorry, Rick.  You can act like a man!  What's the matter with you?  Come on. 
[00:22:00]  The video.  Look, he's trying to get out of the frame of the comic.  Look, he's hitting the sides.  He wants the girl.  No?  No.  Ooh.  Here come the race car guys at the wrench.  Ooh, here it comes.  Oh, now the big standoff.  He's back in the corner.  What is he going to do?  Uh-oh.  Yeah, the guy with the wrench is coming toward him real slow.  What do you do now?  Play a homosexual riff. 
[00:22:30]  It's guilty pleasure, Tuesday.  I'll be at Anthony's show.  I like some songs, but this one I don't like.  It's not catchy.  What's the gayest song you would say that you,  if it came on the radio, maybe here in New York on CBS FM,  playing all the oldies?  Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves by Cher.  I love, um, Phenomenal.  Wait a minute.  That's not a bad song, actually.  No, it's a great song.  For a guilty pleasure.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  They're here for the people of the town.  Yeah, exactly.  No, you're right.  It is gay.  That's really good.  I hate all big boys.  It's terrible.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous.  What's the faggiest song that you would listen to if it came on on your radio often? 
[00:23:30]  A faggiest song.  I'm trying to think.  I would listen to Ole, Ole, Ole by Ricky Martin.  Stop it.  I swear to God, I downloaded that on Napster.  What song?  A Ricky Martin song.  A Ricky Martin song?  Yeah, I downloaded two of them when I was on Napster.  I'm telling you, I have a couple of real Moe songs.  That's like, when I said gay, I didn't mean literally gay songs.  Yeah.  I meant like, wow, that's gay.  Don't be a fag listening to that.  But you really came up with a gay song.  Yeah, I got a few.  Because I own everything Sabbath and Ozzy ever owned. 
[00:24:00]  I might as well, I download, I don't want to download Into the Void again.  But then your guilty pleasures, as they call them, your fag songs, are really bad.  Yeah, so you like this?  This is not really, but it's catchy.  This is catchy.  Like you said before.  So is AIDS.  Yeah.  No, but listen to the words.  I remember when Opie had to go to the store and buy this for his girlfriend. 
[00:24:30]  And you were all like, oh.  You know what's a great song?  What?  I'll give you a great Ricky Martin song.  Really?  Ooh.  Bury yourself.  Look at Ben.  Bury yourself.  He's right.  I don't know if this is the version, though.  What?  The version?  You know different versions of the two?  Do you like the acapella one where you can hear the T-cells falling out?  What are you talking about?  This is the Spanglish radio edit.  If you ever went on vacation to a Club Med resort.  Oh, okay.  Everyone has rocked to this one.  Do you really want it? 
[00:25:00]  Do you really want it?  Woo!  Do you really want it?  All right.  Wow.  Look at Norton dance.  I didn't think he was that good at that hole.  The cup of life.  Oh, is that it?  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  And everyone yells back at their colorful drinks in their hands.  What?  Walking around the place.  Woo!  Go!  Go!  The Club Med guys at the lead of the conga line.  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go! 
[00:25:30]  Go!  Go!  Go!  Go!  I mean, you walk by and you see the kid in the pool and Tommy Lee crying, turn the music  up.  I'm having a good time.  I don't care.  All right.  Oh, here's the fat chick in the bikini.  Oh, she's right in front of me.  Look at that dimpled ass.  And she's free.  But she doesn't care because she's a Club Med.  She's dancing with her boyfriend.  All right, shut up.  Here comes the hook. 
[00:26:00]  Ha, ha, ha.  Tienes que peñar un en serio.  There it goes.  Woo!  Ha!  There's the big black guy that works at Club Med trying to pick up your chick.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo! 
[00:26:30]  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  That's great.  That is Club Med.  I'm just being honest.  That's a good Club Med.  That one I don't mind if I'm in a party atmosphere doing a Club Med thing.  Hey, no, let me tell you something, location has a lot to do with things, man.  If you're a Club Med, and that's on, and you're blasted, and there's, you know, people around,  and you're drinking your colorful drinks, that's fine.  If I'm driving down Main Street in my fine town of Huntington, I'm like, I'm cranking this  out.  Yeah, now there's going to be some problems.  Windows are down.  Yeah.  You know, woo! 
[00:27:00]  That's right.  But if I'm smoking a big, fat Cuban, and there's hot chicks all over the place, and  it's been a nice, nice, uh, you know, sunny day.  You should have added cigar to that.  Yeah, it's funny.  Dale from Jersey.  Opie isn't gay.  He's just desperate.  Hey, you said guilty pleasures?  I know, I understand that.  I know, I understand that.  That's one, that one's okay.  And this, by the way, there's, the, the, weddings ruin stuff like this because you realize what 
[00:27:30]  complete mo's most people are at a wedding.  Oh, when they pick up the blow-up guitars and saxophones and start playing to, uh...  I've never seen that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  And put the sunglasses on.  The, uh...  What movie was that with Tom Cruise?  Cocktail?  No, Risky Business.  Oh, Risky Business.  They all get the Risky Business sunglasses on, and they're doing the kick line to Frank Sinatra.  They're all hammered.  You know what?  People really, I, I, that's why the Israeli dance hall wedding, that should happen at every  reception. 
[00:28:00]  I just sit there.  I just sit in my chair and nurse my drink and watch people dance.  I will knock it out.  I'll do one slow dance with my girl.  Exactly.  That's what I'll do.  Slow dancing is fine.  You're, you're, you're saying nice little things to each other.  Right.  Maybe you're pressing your rod against her, saying, you know, if we only weren't related,  and Dad weren't here to interfere.  Right.  No, but when they play that, when they play, when they play that, I, I, I want to murder people. 
[00:28:30]  Uh, when they do the conga line to, uh, hot, hot, hot.  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Oh, God.  Da-da-da-da-da.  Da-da-da-da.  That taps into a...  Feeling hot, hot, hot.  Doesn't that tap into a raise, like an inner, like, it goes beyond not liking it.  Ole, ole, and they're all going around.  No, get on the conga line.  Come on, get up.  And they're trying to pull you up into it.  Yeah.  You just want to knock someone out.  That's only funny is they're pulling somebody who was injured, and he falls out of his wheelchair,  and they drag him inadvertently, and he Fs up the conga line because people  are stepping on his turnip legs. 
[00:29:00]  Jesus, Ivan, what's up?  Hey, boy, how you doing?  Hey, man.  That's in a guilty pleasure, Dancing Queen by ABBA.  Really?  I sent things on days because of that damn song.  Well, when this song comes out on the radio, you're cranking it, and you're cranking it?  I cranked it on the TV player.  I love it.  Really?  Dancing Queen?  You've got to take a shower after you listen to it, but it's fine.  I don't like this one.  This is one song.  Actually, ABBA is a whole band where you can appreciate the harmonies. 
[00:29:30]  Very, very strange, quirky harmonies that are very catchy.  So sometimes, Ivan, I'll agree with him.  Occasionally, an ABBA song might come on.  You've got to go, all right, I'm not going to change the station.  I'm not going to change it.  Incidentally, you can disagree with Ivan.  Dancing Queen is awful.  Well, yeah, well.  I don't understand what you mean, but you know who else I hated?  Fleetwood Mac and Stevie Nicks, I always thought, were absolutely brutal. 
[00:30:00]  You know what other lame stuff I'll listen to in the car if it comes out?  Unlistenable.  Simon and Garfunkel.  Yeah, they're good.  I'll listen to that.  Another one where you can totally appreciate the voices and everything.  Very nice.  Dude, they were carried shape, and I love them.  He was great.  It's not that they're not hard.  They don't have to be banging their heads for it to be good.  I'm out of ass.  But, you know, Simon and Garfunkel were great.  He just wasn't the greatest driver in the world.  Harry Chapin, you mean?  Yeah, he really wasn't.  Zipping in and out of traffic on the old L.A. 
[00:30:30]  Rumor has it he had a heart attack before he hit the gas truck or whatever he ran into.  How can you tell?  Who needs an autopsy when your head's gone?  What, you don't like some of this stuff?  This is Fleetwood Mac.  This is Bill Clinton's big song in 92.  That got him elected.  Wow.  And don't stop thinking about tomorrow.  What a great president he was with Middle East foreign policy.  Go ahead, bomb the coal.  I'll dance and bang the fat chick.  Don't stop thinking about tomorrow. 
[00:31:00]  That's good.  Well, they're bombing, you know, in Yemen and the embassies.  You know, cigar.  We all know the machine.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  What's happening?  What's up, Johnny?  Hey, gayest song ever, but I bet you'll listen to it.  Karma Camillion.  Yeah, man.  Karma Camillion by Culture Club.  Yeah, that's okay.  I will listen.  Let me tell you something.  You know what, John?  You started something for today.  Today, by the end of the show, we've got to find the gayest song ever.  Your favorite ice cream.  I think I can beat out anyone as far as gayest song ever.  That you listen to? 
[00:31:30]  No.  Oh, okay.  Oh, no, no.  Now we're just going for the gayest song ever written that everyone knows.  Gayest song ever written.  Ever recorded.  I will challenge you guys to come up with one better than the one I will say here.  All right.  All right.  Right said Fred.  Philadelphia.  Oh, I'm too sexy for my shirt.  Too sexy for my shirt.  Too sexy that it hurts.  Come up with a gayer song than that.  Uh, YMCA. 
[00:32:00]  Wow.  It was all about hanging out in a place where men are shirtless.  Sung by homosexuals.  You don't get much gayer than that, do you?  Pretty gay.  Yeah.  In the Navy.  Talking about people.  In the Navy.  Yeah.  You could be with men.  A bunch of seamen on ships.  Yes.  Right.  Hey, there's sailors on his face.  What are they calling something else?  Yeah, this is pretty gay.  Yeah.  It's good, though, but it's gay.  Yeah, the gay horns come in. 
[00:32:30]  You're just picturing massive A-sex.  Right?  Yeah.  Big hairy men.  The big gay mustache.  Yeah.  Oh, the guy, the biker guy with the big walrus.  Yeah.  Then again, the Indian was always my favorite.  So smooth.  Felipe Rose, I believe his name was, if I remember correctly.  You're 70.  Bang it.  My dad took me to see them when I was like, wow.  He took me to see those people and kissed.  Did you have a big tub of popcorn that he kept in his lap with a surprise when he got to the bottom? 
[00:33:00]  Hey, Wright said Fred is gayer than this song.  Butters itself.  Really.  Oh, hell yeah.  Listen.  Hit it.  You missed that.  I'm too sexy for my love.  Too sexy for my love.  Love's going to leave.  Yes.  This is uber gay.  This is cheesier.  Woo!  This is gayer.  I'll give you a gayer one.  I am what I am by the Jewish people.  Well, yeah. 
[00:33:30]  This is really gay, though.  You could almost smell the poppers, the amyl nitrate poppers.  You just named a village people song I've never heard of before.  An insecure song.  Yeah, I used to like them.  Live and Sweet.  It was an album I had years ago.  And I am too sexy for my land.  Too sexy for my land.  But let's go get Japan.  Yeah, only gay men were listening to this.  I'll listen to a lot of stuff. 
[00:34:00]  If it comes on the radio, I won't turn off a lot of stuff from, like, the 80s.  No matter how bad it is.  Even that Karma Chameleon or something.  Just because for that little moment, you could kind of get a recollection of things.  You know what I mean?  It kind of puts you in a moment.  But that's all we had in the 80s.  Yeah.  The only cool band to ever come out of the 80s was Guns N' Roses.  Motley Crue?  It was great, man.  I guess we did have to throw them in there.  Metallica was 80s. 
[00:34:30]  Metallica, right.  They didn't really...  Ozzy?  They didn't make their mark in radio sell out until the 90s.  They didn't make their mark in radio until 1990.  Yeah.  91, I think.  Yeah, Ozzy solo.  I'm serious, though.  Oh, the puffy-haired Ozzy?  No, I'm talking about the first two albums.  I'm talking about the...  Singing with...  What are you doing with Lita Ford?  I'm talking about Lita Ford.  If I close my eyes, why can't the madman be sensitive?  I close my eyes forever.  He was doing love songs since the 70s.  What is... 
[00:35:00]  Is this gayness?  I don't know a lot of people saying this could be gay or...  I know.  What thing is that?  This is fake gay, though.  This is more new old shit.  Club gay?  Yeah.  All right, RuPaul's not gayer than the ones we've mentioned so far?  How about this one?  Oh, wow.  No.  This is pretty gay.  Annoying.  That's...  Wait.  This is pretty gay.  Woo! 
[00:35:30]  Woo!  Look at even Garrett's dancing.  He came strolling in, snapping his fingers.  He's talking about himself.  Bang, bang, bang.  Yeah, this is pretty goddamn gay.  Big Choose Life shirt.  Choose Life.  This is gay.  Choose C and your A.  Wow.  This is really good. 
[00:36:00]  Uh, someone nailed it.  The gayest song ever.  Yeah, I gotta agree.  Everyone's gonna agree with this one.  This could be the gayest song ever.  Ever, without a doubt, if the damn thing will queue up on me.  Mm-hmm.  Come on.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, you hit that song.  Pushing it a little deeper, isn't it?  Hit it, you faggot.  Gayest song ever.  Right here.  All right.  You're gonna...  You're gonna upset him. 
[00:36:30]  My soul, man.  You're gonna upset Jimmy.  All right.  You own it.  It was just a little joke.  Poked at Ozzy.  Bark at the moon.  Gerardo, Rico Suave.  That's pretty goddamn gay.  I think we might even have that one.  God, we have a CD filled with just gay...  We have a CD, O&A show, gay music, CD number one.  I don't know, this is more smarmy.  Maybe.  Exactly, yeah.  Not as gay as it is. 
[00:37:00]  Rico.  Rico.  Suave.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot?  Rico.  This is pretty bad.  Suave.  What happened to the promising career of Gerardo?  Gerardo.  What a tool.  Frankie goes to Hollywood, relax.  That's kind of cool, though.  Yeah, that ain't gay. 
[00:37:30]  He's dying of AIDS, but I don't think it's gay.  No, the guy doing the song being gay doesn't mean the song has to be gay.  You're right.  And a hetero could be singing the gayest song ever.  Like, I don't think we're getting confused.  It doesn't have to be a gay artist or about being gay.  Being faggy.  Just fag song, right.  I mentioned Philadelphia before, which is a great song about, you know, obviously AIDS,  but it's not a gay song is a bad choice.  Yeah, this wasn't that bad.  You don't turn this off if you're driving.  You don't turn this off.  You might crank this up a little. 
[00:38:00]  It has a nice driving beat to it.  I crank this up.  Yeah, you might crank this up a little bit.  What, you don't like this one?  I didn't say I didn't like it, but you don't crank it up.  You would kind of crank this up a little bit, I think.  No, I wouldn't.  I think if the traffic outside's a little loud, you want to maybe hear it a little bit.  You never listen to this?  No, I wouldn't.  That kind of brings you back to a time and a place.  Who cares if your head moves forward a lot during this song?  Exactly. 
[00:38:30]  You put on sabotage and then rinse and get the sea taste out of your mouth.  This is good stuff.  Relax, don't do what?  Put it in your mouth.  That's what he's talking about.  Relax.  That's what he should have done.  Don't suck that.  He should have followed his own advice.  Blame It on the Rain by Milli Vanilli.  Any Milli Vanilli song is pretty goddamn gay. 
[00:39:00]  Stop it and why?  I swear to God.  Why?  You've downloaded two.  Blame It on the Rain.  That one and I downloaded another one.  What was the other big hit they had before the one killed himself?  You downloaded this song?  He took no prisoners.  Not even himself.  Too bad he wasn't in Superman.  He could have flown out that window.  Which one?  Oh, yeah.  You downloaded this.  You flamer.  How can you then talk about any, any song when you're listening to this? 
[00:39:30]  Were you alone in your apartment just listening?  I'm getting the whole picture now.  You know what, man?  Mine's his business.  With your sconces on the wall and your duvets.  I don't have it.  You're getting ready for the radio show.  You just got your underpants on.  You're cranking this after a shower.  You told her to buy.  No.  That's funny.  As you contemplate suicide.  Or maybe you were just dancing around the room crying naked like the beginning of Apocalypse Now.  Doing karate moves in the nude to this. 
[00:40:00]  You want to close the door, buddy?  Or what?  Heart seen on good cheeks.  Good cheeks.  God, this is awful.  Wasn't even them.  I'll agree.  But I can't pretend I didn't download it.  I did.  Blame it on the rain.  It's better, right?  I wonder why you would download that.  It had real taste.  Jim, do you blame it on the rain?  Sometimes.  My tears are like rain. 
[00:40:30]  By the way, it was pretty stupid of me to say that not many real cool bands came from the 80s.  Yeah.  You too.  James Addiction.  I know.  They're coming out of woodwork.  Nirvana?  Nirvana?  What an idiot.  Nirvana?  They're from like 89.  What an idiot.  Black Crow started in the 80s.  Are they from 89?  Nirvana?  Nirvana did not start in 89, my friend.  When did they get together?  I bet you're wrong.  I bet they got together.  I consider a band making like when it finally hits radio, kind of.  Because before that, only a small amount of people really know who they are. 
[00:41:00]  Nirvana hit.  Nirvana hit, I don't know, in 91, 92.  Technically, I'm right.  I'm like...  91, I think.  Gerardo update.  He's working for Interscope in L.A.  There you go.  Good luck.  Godspeed to you, Gerardo.  Good luck.  Why don't we take a break, okay?  All right.  I don't know what the hell we just accomplished here, but it's the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to talk more about them.  Well, no.  This is going to be an ongoing thing.  We've got to find the gayest song today. 
[00:41:30]  What's in the lead so far?  Oh, man.  I'm too sexy.  It's pretty brutal.  That's gay.  What was the other one you played?  YMCA is...  Oh, Gogo.  Wake me up before you go-go.  That was pretty gay.  Oh, dude.  Nothing as faggier than that.  He got caught looking at a mule in a bathroom.  I know, but we're not going with a lot of them.  But that all combined, Gogo, he's a fag.  I don't dislike gay people, but if you're talking about the gayest song, that is number one.  I think we need a criteria here.  Are we looking for the gayest song as far as gay goes, or just the gayest sounding like 
[00:42:00]  faggy song?  It can't be a combination of everything.  No, no.  It's got to be just the gayest sounding song.  Right.  So it doesn't have to be a gay guy doing it, or it doesn't have to be about being gay.  Absolutely.  You're right.  All right.  But that happens to fit everything.  Try not to be influenced by that.  It's raining men.  Hallelujah.  It's raining men.  You know what?  I'll argue that point.  If it was a guy singing that song, it would probably be the gayest song ever, but there's  a chick singing it, so it's like, all right, whatever. 
[00:42:30]  It's a song for chicks when they go to the stupid male strip club.  Electric Slide?  No, that just sucks.  It's another one they pull out at all the events, the weddings, the club meds.  White people get up, and blacks are 40 years ahead of us with music.  They jump up and they do it, you dopey crackers.  They just laugh and dance and get fat and middle class.  It's so awful.  Good God.  Hey, why don't we step aside here?  We've got a lot to do.  Love you, Steve.  Yes. 
[00:43:00]  We've got to talk about John Travolta today.  He's a pilot.  We all know that.  Not only a pilot, a 747 pilot.  Pretty amazing.  Yeah.  What are his motives here?  I don't know.  Apparently, he made you read a new script on that plane while he's flying it, so he doesn't  do any more crappy films.  And Anthony saw Andy Rooney on the streets of the room today, and he's got some comments  about that.  For 60 Minutes.  Cool.  Maybe we'll talk about that next.  Let's rock.  You guys are able. 
[00:43:30]  You sound like a fruity stick in the mud.  I hate you.  Sew up that worthless slot.  Oh, my God.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show, finally.  That's what happens when you do 47 minutes of straight radio.  We've got to make up for lost time.  Sorry about that.  Disorganization. 
[00:44:00]  Huh?  It's our own disorganization.  No, if we're in a flow, though, we've got to keep going.  I know.  You're feeling it.  You've got to go with it.  Some guy just instant feedback said, contestant 23 from the WOW Contest, Jay is built like  Silent Bob.  That's pretty good.  So, Andy, so, Andy, so Anthony saw the Opie and Andy Show.  I'm being stared at, and it's hard. 
[00:44:30]  It's hard to do this show.  I'll be, what do I do?  It's so difficult.  You're making them leave?  I don't make them leave.  They all, they seem like nice people, Anthony.  Yeah, but it's hard to do a bit now.  Poor young, bright, good-looking people.  I know.  You want them to leave?  Are they, no.  What do you want them to leave, man?  They're nice people.  Why don't you tell them to leave, then?  It's teasing.  No, you, you, you know, Opie.  Get the hell out. 
[00:45:00]  No.  Show them the door, Ben.  Are they from, they're the fine, the fine kids.  They help syndicate our radio show, Anthony.  Westwood One.  Be nice to them.  I am.  It's Anthony that's the problem.  No, I'm not.  I'm the sweetheart.  Anthony said during commercials,  I hope these people leave by the time we go back live.  I absolutely swear to God I never said that.  That's horrible.  He'll never admit it. 
[00:45:30]  He wrote it down, though, if you want to read it.  Oh, and it doesn't make you a little jittery?  You called me Andy, you dick.  Right?  Jimmy doesn't care.  Now what are we going to do?  They think we really want them to stay.  Look at how they keep going to the door every time that's said.  Oh, now they're being reamed out.  You guys can stay.  You know what we're joking, right?  You guys help syndicate the show.  Oh, you know the ins and outs of Aunt and I. 
[00:46:00]  What are you, interns?  Yeah.  No, not all of them.  She's a big wig.  No, I know.  I'm talking to the kids.  They're interns.  They're interns, so you want to learn about the business?  Is that it?  Yeah.  The fine world of radio.  Yeah.  Yes.  Very good.  So we said we should bring them over to O&A,  because that's where they'll learn everything that they need to know.  This is the don't part of the learning.  This is the part where, believe me, it cannot possibly work. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  Well, did you learn anything?  No.  No?  I had to play football.  As I'm poking around in engineering, looking at equipment.  Yeah.  You need a pinball table and a foosball table.  It doesn't make anything work.  Where are you from?  Who cares?  This is bad radio.  Get the hell out.  Gee, see?  See?  I knew it wouldn't take long before his true side came through.  Yeah, he really is awful.  You guys are sweethearts, right? 
[00:47:00]  Well, thank you so much for coming by today, though.  What does that mean, Ant?  That means you wanted to leave.  No, I'm just saying.  No, it didn't mean leave.  I'm just thanking them for coming by.  What do you mean by that?  I didn't mean anything by it.  When you say, thanks for coming by, that means the visit is over.  No.  I hope they can take a hit.  No.  Z, Garrett's all of a sudden making that like this thing.  Yeah.  Like Garrett was doing this.  What did that mean, Garrett?  You got to move on. 
[00:47:30]  Is that it?  Yeah.  But we want him to hang.  Yeah.  Let's get back to the gay songs.  What are you, Gelman?  Garrett has become Gelman all of a sudden.  Gelman.  All right.  Well, Ant wants you to leave, so I guess that's...  No, no.  I didn't say leave.  I just...  I'm not talking to you about that.  I guess that's...  Thank you.  Thank you so much.  I guess that's the end of your visit, because Anthony doesn't want you hanging out anymore.  You know I got him with a drop something gag.  It works every time, and it's classic. 
[00:48:00]  You got your pictures.  Get the hell out of here.  Come on.  You know what I was talking about, right?  That's why I did it.  They were all eager to be looking at you guys and enjoying your presence.  What was wrong with that?  I knew right from when we cracked the mics over that break, and Ovi goes, well, Andy saw...  No.  I mean, Anthony.  We get distracted very easily.  We all do.  Nervous Nelly.  Well, you were facing me.  I'm facing this way. 
[00:48:30]  I just got like...  They were staring at the equipment and everything.  Dude, you so missed the opportunity.  We could have had to really do nothing but vicious rape and AIDS jokes.  How uncomfortable that would have made them.  Yeah, but...  No, I think we made them uncomfortable, Jim.  Yeah.  So you don't have to go that way all the time to make someone uncomfortable.  I know.  I think that worked.  Sometimes you just base your stuff on reality, and it's more uncomfortable than kind of forcing it.  And then you're being all nice, and then when they chuckled, they weren't able to hear you say,  now, get out.  I did not say that, because they're still listening down the hall. 
[00:49:00]  You did, too, say that.  I did not.  I'll play the goddamn tape for them myself.  I don't know what you're talking about.  I want to say hi to Steve Dahl, who's listening to us today.  Yeah.  We had a great lunch with Steve Dahl, a legend in the business.  That's right.  For some reason, a lot of people want to know how our lunch with Steve Dahl went, so I'm telling you, it went great.  How did they know we were going to lunch with Steve Dahl today?  What did you have?  Opie taking a big chance at lunch, I noticed.  Why?  He takes a big chance at lunch. 
[00:49:30]  Why?  I would never recommend anything for anybody, because if they don't like it, they will always remember the time that that ass recommended something that sucked.  They got a nice tuna thing down there.  I know, but that's even a bigger one, because you don't know, first of all.  They're known for that.  Yeah, but get this, get this.  You don't know if somebody, because Opie goes, hey, the tuna here is great.  It's fantastic.  You've got to get it.  And then it's almost like, all right, now I'm almost obligated to get it. 
[00:50:00]  Tuna is a weird thing, because you get it, and it's raw.  You said rare.  It's grilled.  It's grilled tuna.  Middle, completely raw.  It's kind of like sushi tuna, but they kind of grill the outside a little bit.  They grill the outside.  So if you're somebody that doesn't enjoy the raw meat, you'd cut into it and go, uh-oh, now I've got to eat it.  So I'm thinking, oh, my God, I hope Steve enjoys the raw tuna and doesn't feel like, you know, because Opie recommended it.  Do you think he enjoyed it? 
[00:50:30]  Oh, yeah.  He ate everything on his plate.  He cleaned it.  I know.  He loved the tuna.  Absolutely.  But I was like, you know, wow, that's the...  And that's with anybody.  It's kind of taking a chance if you recommend something, because then they'll always remember you for ruining one of their meals.  We got ammunition, too.  We told him stuff.  He told us stuff.  My God.  The little trading of stories that go on.  You know, this isn't for the air, but... 
[00:51:00]  And then you tell the story.  Right.  And how did we know that she was there?  Right.  We don't know.  Right now, Ken is like having a hemorrhage, even hearing that.  Yeah, Ken wanted us to take the day off today.  We talked about everything, other radio personalities.  It was great to finally sit down and talk to the guy.  He's a legend in the business.  Behind-the-scenes stuff of shows that have come and go in various markets and whatnot.  Things like that.  It's so much fun.  So much fun.  All right.  So, Anthony saw Andy Rooney on the streets of New York today. 
[00:51:30]  You know Andy Rooney from 60 Minutes.  Right.  He's the old guy.  He was even old when I was a kid, watching that show.  And he's the guy they go to at the end of the show that does a segment on everything or anything.  I don't even understand most of the stuff he talks about.  He pulls out...  What are with erasers?  Rubber things on the end of a pencil.  Simple thing, but they erase mistakes you make. 
[00:52:00]  Wouldn't a life eraser be great?  What?  What is this guy getting...  Is he drawing a check?  Yes, he is.  Is he drawing a check for this?  So I saw him walking down the street.  He's walking down 10th.  And he had a film crew with him?  Had a film crew with him.  I guess he was doing a segment for 60 Minutes.  And he has one person that holds him up.  He's so old.  That's their whole job, to hold him up?  Yes.  That's all I could see.  There was a camera guy.  There was a woman producer.  Had the clipboard and everything. 
[00:52:30]  And then Andy and some woman walking next to him, like, holding him up.  I'm looking, going, oh, the poor bass.  He's limping.  He's limping along.  And I'm stopped at the light.  And there's some construction going on at the corner.  And he just stopped and kind of looked at the construction, kind of teetering back and forth,  just with wonder, looking at a guy with a shovel.  What can I make up about this situation?  This looks like something.  What's with the shovels?  You ever notice you can just kind of pick dirt up and lay it aside? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah.  And?  You ever notice I just ran out of things to say back in about 79 or 80?  And I have nothing new?  I went to his website.  Bathtub battle.  What the hell is that?  Do we really need bathtubs in the house anymore?  This is one of the things he does.  We got into an argument at his house. 
[00:53:30]  He goes, recently, I wanted to tear out both bathtubs and put in shower stalls.  Most houses have the same number of bathtubs as they do television sets.  Television sets are used all the time, but with the exception of small children, the bathtub's never used.  And why are they called sets?  There's only one.  There's only one.  Why do you drive on a parkway?  Parking on a driveway.  If 7-Eleven is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, why do they have locks on the door? 
[00:54:00]  Why am I doing Stephen Wright's material?  Right.  Why are they called apartments if they're together?  Strange.  Strange how that is.  Strange, that's a pretty good impression.  He goes into this whole thing of how he doesn't like bathtubs and thinks they're dated, should be taken out,  and he doesn't like the shower in the bathtub.  It's unsatisfactory. 
[00:54:30]  A Rube Goldberg kind of arrangement.  I just like shower stall.  Now, looking at him today, I realize he's the kind of guy that can't get into or out of a bathtub.  Isn't that big?  No, I mean, you can get all crippled up.  Oh, because he's frail and stuff?  You get to an age where you can't get into or out of bathtubs anymore.  I got a story about an old, I'll just say an older woman.  I'm not saying who it is or anything.  It's somebody I know's relative.  Let's just put it that way.  A grandmother. 
[00:55:00]  Is she dead or alive?  Alive.  Okay.  Did you used to visit this person a lot?  No.  No.  No.  Okay.  Now, this is somebody else's side of the family thing.  Old woman.  Grandmother.  Within 40 miles of New York City?  Yeah.  Okay.  Yeah.  I don't need you to go on an hour tangent today, man.  I was taking a bath when all of a sudden... 
[00:55:30]  That's what happens when you get old.  You go in the bathtub and the old woman couldn't get out.  She couldn't get out of the bathtub.  So she had to keep running the hot water so she wouldn't have hypothermia.  Shut up.  As she just waited.  Dude.  She just waited.  Waited there.  How long did she have to wait?  For some younger relatives to realize that she wasn't answering the phone.  I don't mean to laugh, but that's awful. 
[00:56:00]  You don't mean to laugh?  That's hilarious.  And then...  No, I'll tell you why I don't mean to laugh, because it's obvious that he's related to this person.  It's a lot funnier when you don't know the person.  No, it's not really a relation.  See, I can laugh at stupid things like that, but then if it happens to someone in your family,  then you're like, ugh, okay, this is awful.  No, this is the most horrific part.  Wait, can I ask you something?  Yeah.  Are you related to this person?  No.  Terrible.  This could be any old woman.  She's in the top. 
[00:56:30]  How do you know this person?  This is a better story.  Who is this person?  Give me a hint.  It is a relative.  No, no, not my relative.  It's a relative you don't like.  No, no.  Related to my girlfriend.  Oh, see?  So that's not funny, because...  It's not related.  I'm conveying a story.  Until you had to pump me for info, it would have just been an anonymous old lady.  I feel bad.  Don't worry about it.  I'm trying to get this thing to go down, but... 
[00:57:00]  I'm just telling the story, I'm conveying the story, that now one of the brother-in-laws  had to come over, and, you know, Buddy, he played on the softball game, had to knock  the door down.  And she's there naked?  That was the hardest part.  In the bathtub?  He had to get her out of the bathtub.  How long was she there for?  Hours.  Oh, just from there?  Hours, having to run the warm water, because the water cools off.  But I'm just thinking, you get to the age now where you can't get into a bathtub, that's 
[00:57:30]  what life has in store for you.  Why couldn't she get out?  Is she injured, or is she just too late?  You don't have the muscles anymore to pull yourself out of the tub.  There comes a day when you realize your muscles don't work anymore.  They just don't stop.  They slowly stop working, and all of a sudden, you know, you were in the bathtub the day before,  you got out fine, and all of a sudden...  Now you can't.  All of a sudden, this is the day that my muscles are going to fail me.  And you just don't realize it.  All of a sudden, you're like, you're walking around, things you used to be able to do. 
[00:58:00]  Jimmy, you must twist it, Norton.  And took her out of the tub, and then she was fine.  But did he cover her up?  You got to cover...  What do you think of course?  No, you got to put a towel on her before you take her out.  To hear Buddy tell the story is classic, because she's there.  But he tried.  You know, he tried putting a towel on her or something.  But when you're taking dead weight out of a tub, did she look hot? 
[00:58:30]  It's like, no, I'm sure not.  Do you think the wet bosoms were touching his bare arms again?  Jesus.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.  Because when you pick somebody up, think about it, you have to lift under their arms.  So basically, their torso is...  So at one point, your hip areas...  You can fantasize all you want, Jimmy.  All I know is I heard the story from Buddy.  And I know him.  And he was like, oh my God.  I had to boot cough. 
[00:59:00]  And it was a harrowing time for him.  And you know, you can only cover up so much, because you still got to pick up and then kind  of turn over.  You don't know what's happening.  Maybe the towel can come off.  Hmm.  I'm thinking, though, you got to look.  I don't think there's any choice.  Like, you can't help but look.  But I mean, even if you could avoid looking, you'd still have to take a peek just to see  what it looks like after a certain point in evolution. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, Stephanie, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hey, well, I just thought I was listening to you guys and talking about, you know, old  ladies pretty much falling and hurting themselves.  And my grandmother, she fell in the bathroom, and she was stuck in there for about three  hours, because the bathroom was small, and she had a hip replacement on.  So she was stuck in there, and it was like a whole bunch of firefighters and police officers  in there, and she was naked.  Oh, my God.  I know. 
[01:00:00]  It was really disgusting.  That's sad.  Yeah, and she's not too hot either, so.  But it's not only grandmothers in Long Island.  There was some kid that spent two days trying to get out of the pool.  Yeah, but the funny thing about it is she's sitting there making jokes about, you know,  her little snatch.  Oh, stop it.  I swear to God.  She was, you know, she's all flirting, and she was like, hey, why don't you take a picture?  It lasts longer.  How old abroad is she?  She's all 82.  82, and she's telling the fire department to take pictures of her cooch. 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, I know.  It was, you know, she pretty much had fun, you know.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Thank you, Stephanie.  You're welcome.  All right, bye.  Thanks for sharing today.  That's what this show's about, sharing.  Brian, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  You guys want some info on old people?  I work in a nursing home as a nurse.  Let me tell you what.  Faggot.  No, good money.  Yeah.  Give us your best story.  Go.  The best one is that actually happened today. 
[01:01:00]  I'm not going to say what state I work at, but the state was in to inspect the nursing home.  Old man with Alzheimer's walking down the hallway, drops trowel right in front of him.  Guy's getting a kick out of his own story, and we're just kind of like, all right, he dropped trowel.  Hey, yeah, never mind.  Have a good day, guys.  Later.  Later.  No, no, no, wait.  Guess he had to be there.  That was awful.  All right, so what was Andy Rooney doing?  And the old man said something, and no one heard him.  So Andy Rooney was filming a piece?  Yeah, they were leading him around. 
[01:01:30]  Leading him around.  Is it true he has more hair in his ears than on top of his head?  Yeah, just white, pure white.  Looks like he saw God, saw the burning bush, his hair completely white.  And I guess he was doing a segment, but it did look like they walk him around, and he looks  at stuff and tries to figure out, like, what to do.  That's why when I saw him looking at the construction thing, I'm like, oh, he's doing a segment on  this, you know, because he was really interested in it.  But then, no, he just kind of turned back on the sidewalk and kept walking straight. 
[01:02:00]  And I'm thinking, that's what they do with this guy.  They lead him around, and he just looks around.  What's with the tar piece that fits between the pieces of curve on the sidewalk?  What's that for?  Is it like a shock absorber?  If something hits it, it'll go off on anything.  You ever wonder why I'm still on TV with these inane observations that no one really cares  about, but they're just not ready to turn the show off yet?  I can't believe no one has noticed that I have nothing to say.  I've bought a bunch of paperclips and have them laying out on my desk. 
[01:02:30]  There are many different sides of paperclips.  Who thought of the way to bend these things anyway?  I think it comes from the Greek papyrus clipora.  It's like, what?  Do you think my bosses are just too scared to fire me at this point?  Here's my paycheck I get every week.  Why do I get this?  If you notice the amount written on the front, it's quite large.  Larger than I think a lot of people's. 
[01:03:00]  Why do they keep signing this check and sending me one when all I do is stupid things like this?  I'll tell you why.  Because in this drawer, I got naked pictures of the boss.  Here's some nude pictures of the boss at CBF.  This is why I'm still employed.  Maybe these pictures wouldn't work, but here's one of him with a man.  This is the one that got me my raise.  So I'll continue to sit here and do things about erasers and paperclips. 
[01:03:30]  As long as I have a picture of the boss sucking on this.  And on man's sex.  That's what I got in this drawer.  He's got to.  It's called job security.  Bet you wish you had this at your place of employment.  Just ordinary photographs.  Could just be vacation pictures, anything. 
[01:04:00]  Isn't film amazing?  You take a picture and put it in a photo album and maybe look back at it with your family and it brings you great joy.  But these pictures got me money.  And a lot of it.  You could film the darndest things with hidden cameras.  Oh, it's the same principle.  Light enters the shutter and puts an image on film.  That image is very important.  Did you know that my boss is railing his secretary?  I could say that because I got the pictures. 
[01:04:30]  It's in a safe.  He doesn't want his wife getting those pictures.  He knows I have them.  So I'll just continue doing things about pencil lead.  Is it really lead?  Did they ever really use lead?  And erasers.  I'm just going to sit here and see how long people listen to silence and look at the hair in my ears.  I really don't have to do anything.  I choose to do it.  And name little clips.  I'm going to do a piece on those little tools used to cut the ear hair.  How happy do you think the at symbol is on a keyboard? 
[01:05:00]  Many years it wasn't used.  Now with the advent of the internet, it seems everyone's using the at symbol.  Here's a picture of my boss taking it up the keister.  Maybe next week I'll talk about the anarchy.  Who knows?  Who cares?  I'm getting paid.  Andy Rooney.  He's an American legend. 
[01:05:30]  American icon.  I love him.  Hey, the latest wow contuck.  God damn, I can't speak today.  All right, Philly.  Look at you.  Strong comeback.  Oh, yeah?  A couple girls entering in Philly today.  Beautiful.  Is she from Philly, too?  Yeah, she's from.  Wow, nice.  Take a look.  See?  They've got a late game rally going on.  Do they?  Yes.  I've got to scroll down.  That's a different girl, too?  No, this is the same one.  Oh, okay.  Which one?  Corey?  Number 40.  Number 40 is nice.  Let me look. 
[01:06:00]  And 41, right?  Nice set going there.  Hey, Dan, what's going on?  Hey, how's it going, man?  Hey.  I got a 10-gauge.  I don't forget.  Its nickname is Thunder.  10-gauge shotgun?  Yeah, 3 1⁄2-inch Magnum.  Wow, that's pretty nice.  What do you hunt with that?  Bags.  Jesus, dude.  Stop.  No, you want to hear it?  Where do you live?  Middletown, New York.  Well, outside of Middletown.  Middletown, so you're in the woods?  Well, yeah, kind of.  I'm shooting across the road.  I hope no one comes. 
[01:06:30]  Upstate New York.  Yeah.  What kind of shot are you firing out of that thing?  Well, it's 3 1⁄2-inch Magnum.  It's number BB.  All right.  Steel shot.  No slugs.  Yep.  All right, ready?  Let's give a listen.  Okay.  Holy cow.  Hey, that's a good one.  Yeah, that's nice.  Can you load up one more?  Yep.  All right, let's see.  Oh, this thing flies out.  It hit me right in the face.  I heard it fly, too.  Yeah. 
[01:07:00]  Yeah.  All right, ready?  One more.  Okay.  Nice.  Hello.  That's beautiful, dude.  That's what I'm talking about today.  Oh, wow.  I just took off a big part of my dad's pine tree.  All right, Dan, thank you.  No problem.  Bye.  We love our heavy weapons here on the program.  Why not?  People have been calling and firing them off.  We want automatic weapons, by the way.  That was pretty good, though.  Bob from Philly.  We're back, baby.  Check out Corey from Philly.  Represent in the WoW contest. 
[01:07:30]  All right.  Is she a dancer?  She's...  Looks like she could be with the...  Yeah, she's beautiful.  Nice side shot.  See, we talk about the ladies when they're beautiful.  Corey's beautiful.  There you go.  There's some nice shots of her up on opiananthony.com,  the latest contestant.  $5,000 up for grabs.  Risquévideo.com.  Thank you.  Mmm.  No lady showing up in New York once again today, so...  All right, Dan, so that's your Andy Rooney story.  Well, that was, yeah, a little bit of Andy Rooney on the road.  Just walking down the street doing nothing. 
[01:08:00]  Being held up by another woman.  I felt bad for him.  He is really old.  Well, you get these institutions that they just don't go away for.  They don't know when to leave.  And his job isn't that demanding.  So it's not like he has to retire.  That old curmudgeon around the office.  I'm sure he has plenty of great stories around the water cooler.  Why do they call it a water cooler?  I haven't seen one that cooled in quite some time.  Here's my boss and the CEO on 69. 
[01:08:30]  This one got me a company car.  This guarantees me at least two more years of air time.  All right, Dan.  We'll talk about Travolta.  I think Ted Nugent's checking in today, right?  A little while.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah.  He's got that book of his?  Yeah.  What is that?  Let me see.  Kill it and grill it?  He's such a rebel.  There he is. 
[01:09:00]  Who's that chick on the cover?  Wife.  Is that his wife?  Yeah, she's beautiful.  And she hunts, too?  Oh, yeah, the whole family hunts.  Hunts.  He's got a recipe for, like, caribou.  Yeah.  The problem is, where are you going to find caribou?  Well, you've got to hunt it like Ted.  Is there a supermarket in Manhattan where you can get some good caribou to try out the  recipe?  It's a kid, a picture of a kid holding up a dead squirrel. 
[01:09:30]  What are you going to do?  Collects another limb rat for the pot.  They call squirrels limb rats.  And they eat squirrels.  The Nugents eat squirrels?  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah.  Well, if it's shot in these pictures, they eat it.  They don't just kill for sport.  Not the Nuge.  And, um...  See, I can understand you want some exotic food.  You want to eat the elk.  You know?  You want to eat the mallard.  What are you eating? 
[01:10:00]  Uh-oh.  What are you eating?  Are you eating a caribou?  Are you eating a muskox?  There's that tuna.  Sorry.  Mary, what's going on?  Nothing.  I got my husband over here.  Do you know something about the gun?  The gun.  Does he have a gun?  Yeah.  My husband has a gun!  But, um...  Oh, jeez.  I can't think of the name of it.  Put him on the phone.  He's in our backyard.  It's going to take a second.  All right? 
[01:10:30]  All right.  All right.  We'll go to a break with this.  Can I see the cookbook real fast?  What is she doing?  She hung up.  Perhaps she has to go to the back.  Oh.  I don't know.  We got Ted Nugent on hold, so we better take a quick break and talk to him next.  All right.  All right.  Okay?  You guys have redefined debauchery.  It's like a boss-bill show on acid.  Opie Anthony.  What are you saying?  The Opie and Anthony Show.  WNW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:00]  On the hotline, Ted Nugent.  That's beautiful.  Gunfire for Uncle Ted. 
[01:11:30]  Uncle Teddy, baby.  Antonio Alta.  How you boys doing?  It's been a long time, my friend.  Yes, you miss me, don't you?  I love when you...  Why don't you get rid of the damn music and just shoot some more damn guns off?  Well, we actually...  We have a bunch of people that have been calling up and shooting their guns for us.  I love that.  Around the country.  I love that.  We got a beautiful AR-15.  Beautiful.  Only one?  Yeah.  It was great, though.  You know, we got the MTV Crip Boys coming in here next week to film the Nugent Estate here. 
[01:12:00]  I got more damn guns than all them boys combined.  I got guns behind every door.  I'm going to just have like a firepower orgy right there on MTV and make them just blood.  Hey, are you going to hide anything before they get there?  No, we're just going to invite him in, open the gate, let him make themselves at home, you know?  There's got to be something you're thinking.  You know what?  Maybe this isn't ready for national TV.  No.  Mrs. Nugent thought we got to clean the place up, and I went, no way.  Just let it fly?  We're going to have some gut piles in the living room with dead fish flopping around the kitchen.  We're going to have all kinds of beautiful things. 
[01:12:30]  Gut piles.  Gut piles, baby.  Story of my life.  I'll tell you, you would make our day if you shut off one of your weapons at the end of this.  You know, I could go to the other phone.  I could touch off more damn firepower than Uncle Sam did in WW2, boys.  Ted, we would love that.  Are you serious?  We would love that.  That's so easy.  I got a choice.  I got a Benelli 90 right here with eight rounds of triple-ot buck.  I got a Glock model 20 and 10 millimeter with four extra magazines.  That's just on my damn belt.  Same belt I was wearing in your studio that day.  You're wearing it.  I've got a Remington 700 and 22, 250, and I got a Remington 788 and 243. 
[01:13:00]  They're all literally, I'm touching them right now.  Oh, you've got to switch phones.  I'm fondling massive firepower.  I just can't shoot upstairs here in the office.  You've got to switch phones, man.  I can do it.  I can go downstairs and switch phones.  I've got a deck.  I've got 2,000 acres that is one big firing range.  Because we've been doing it for the last couple of days, and a lot of people are getting off on it.  Yeah, gunpowder's cool, man.  I don't sniff cocaine.  I sniff gunpowder.  Nice.  Yeah, it's beautiful.  Black cocaine.  We're checking out Kill It and Grill It there. 
[01:13:30]  How could you not?  Life is a barbecue, gentlemen.  The new book by Ted Nugent.  We've got a grill going outside right now.  It's like our Cochise is looking for communication through smoke.  It's so beautiful.  We've got venison and dead pigs.  We've got a bunch of bluegill fillets.  My son and his buddies, they caught a whole mess of bluegills this morning.  So we're having a flesh spirit orgy right now.  It's like Little House on the Prairie.  No, it's Big House on the Swamp.  Big difference.  Well, first off, I've got to tell you, your wife is beautiful.  How beautiful is she? 
[01:14:00]  Yeah, that's smart, putting her on the cover of the book, man.  Oh, Anthony, I want to hear it from both of you.  In harmony.  Nugent, you're a lucky son of a bitch.  Say it.  Yes, yes, Nugent.  You are a lucky son of a bitch.  Thank you very much.  Drive safely.  You married a piece of ass.  How about that?  The finest, the finest twanger on planet Earth.  You've got the rifle with you.  She's got the cooking utensils.  Wang dang, sweet poontang.  It's not a song, boys.  It's a mindset.  What's the most exotic meat you've ever cooked up?  A black girl backstage at the Grandy Ballroom.  No, I've eaten gut piles with the natives in Zimbabwe and the Sudan. 
[01:14:30]  I ran with the Masai.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, what's gut piles?  Gut piles, that's the innards.  That's like the...  I know, of what animal and why?  Well, that was with, I was hunting with, I think it's in the Kill It and Grill It book.  I hunted in the Sudan.  I was the last white guy there.  How white, we don't know.  But I was there running with the Masai and the Watusi.  And it was when E.D. Amin and his boys came in and decided to kill everybody.  So these guys ran me out of the country. 
[01:15:00]  They showed me the way out.  Really?  And when I ran with these guys, we stopped in these villages.  There's no roads.  There's no nothing.  I just ran with these big, tall basketball stars, man.  And they were naked.  They were cool.  They liked me because I could kill stuff with a bow and arrow way out there.  And I ran with them, and we ate some stuff.  You know, we only stopped after dark.  And I couldn't tell what it was.  I know I shot a beautiful, big roan antelope.  It's like a big horse.  It's a real wary antelope.  And I shot this, and it's highly prized for its guts and the insides. 
[01:15:30]  That's what they get all their protein and fat from.  Really?  These guys, they don't cook it up.  But we had a fire going at one of these little grass hut villages.  And they cooked some of this stuff up for me.  And I'll tell you, I don't know what it was, but, boy, it was good.  But it was cooked?  It wasn't just...  No, I wasn't going to.  These guys reach right into the still-throbbing guts and pull out the liver and the pancreas  and start slicing and eating right there.  That's sushi for those guys.  Yeah, it is.  Absolutely.  Plus, it's the highest form of protein and fat, and they need that stuff. 
[01:16:00]  But, you know, I'm an adventurous guy, but I ain't that adventurous.  So I didn't eat that stuff.  But we put a little fire to it, and it was good.  Now, Ted, is it true that you eat everything you shoot?  Absolutely, except we kill a lot of coons and possums and skunks and coyotes and fox.  We don't eat them, but we use all the skins and everything from them.  Yeah, but there's a picture of your son holding up a squirrel.  Oh, yeah, we eat a lot of limb rats.  Limb rats are good.  They eat a lot of acorns.  That's sweet meat.  Limb rats.  Limb rats.  Squirrels good eating?  Oh, you guys have got to come out of here for a fall. 
[01:16:30]  A fall spirit of the wild orgy with Uncle Ted.  I will feed you food that is the finest-tasting, healthiest food on the planet.  And squirrels are some of the best because that's all they eat is acorns, so their flesh is real sweet.  It's like the ultimate kosher kosher, you know.  How do you prepare a squirrel?  You kill it and you add fire.  You're not talking any fancy sauces here.  Oh, you can if you want to.  You know, I've got all kinds of marinades.  I'm like the master.  I'm like God of marinade, man. 
[01:17:00]  I'll put some slop together in the kitchen.  You don't want to just get a radiator hose and suck it up.  It's like apple cider vinegar and brown sugar and olive oil and garlic pepper and garlic salt.  Oh, my God.  And a little bit of French dressing.  You whip that all up with like an egg beater and just whip it up until it foams.  And you lay that squirrel ass down in that glass pan overnight and soak up all that good stuff.  And you put it on the fire in the morning.  I'm telling you, it's like sex with a singe.  You know, we've got to confess something to you.  There was a time we invited a couple of chefs in here and they cooked up rat. 
[01:17:30]  Rat's good.  And surprisingly, well, we were.  I don't know about New York City rat, but I eat muskrat.  No, no, no, no.  These rats came from the subways.  We killed them.  We had two cooks and we had a French chef in here and he made the rat taste good.  He made the rat au plov.  Enough garlic and butter, you'd be surprised what you'd eat.  It was such a bummer because we did this bit hoping that they were going to eat the rat and, you know, start puking.  And these people started going back for seconds.  Well, it probably tasted good.  I'm just not so sure of the quality of the flesh of a New York City rat, some of the crap they eat there. 
[01:18:00]  You know, like the pigeons in New York, the pigeons in Chicago.  I catch them when I go to Chicago and perform every year.  I'm going back the next week and I have this little ritual.  I take my kids out on the street of Chicago.  I've never done it in Manhattan, but I've come real close and I actually catch these pigeons alive.  And when people beg for food, I smack the pigeon's head on the railing somewhere and give them the damn pigeon if they want food.  But I was told by some of my cop buddies in Chicago that these pigeons from the inner city are all toxic because they eat all that nasty, toxic stuff. 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  So I don't eat that.  Did you ever eat an animal that you thought was just awful and you'd never eat it again?  No.  I eat, you know, mountain lion, black bear in Africa, the actual lion steaks.  The native Africans that I hunt with, they consider the lion to be a sacred beast.  And when they kill it, they use all the body fluids and all the phlegm from the carcass as medicine.  And the old people over there don't have any arthritis or any sore bones or joints because the phlegm from the lion carcass, 
[01:19:00]  they actually rub it like a lotion and it's just an amazing, amazing lifestyle.  I do my damnedest to live that over here, you know.  That's insane.  It is awesome.  Well, it's so alien, though.  No, it's alien in Manhattan, but the rest of the world gets along just fine with it.  I like this.  You've got a couple of, I guess, pheasant in your hand here in this picture.  And it says, Gonzo is your dog and Ted, cocks in hand.  Cox in hand, baby.  That's what it is.  He's got two. 
[01:19:30]  I'm big on cocks.  You like hunting the cocks?  I like stalking the ever-elusive cocks.  You know, you guys redefine debauchery.  We try.  But you know what?  This is almost like a Broadway show on acid.  Yeah.  You've been hunting and seen one cock and said, well, there's a bigger cock.  That's the one I really want.  No, but it sounds good coming from you.  Right.  Hey, now the book looks great, Ted, but I have a problem.  I bet you do.  I can help you.  Where the hell am I going to find antelope so I can try the sweet and sour recipe? 
[01:20:00]  Well, you know, within 20 minutes of downtown Manhattan, you guys got so many damn deer  over there in Westchester, over in New Jersey.  You got more black bear than in recorded history right across the damn river.  And in New Jersey, you got more damn deer.  There are more Canadian geese in America, particularly right in New Jersey, than there's ever been in  recorded history.  So I'd say, get yourself a damn gun and get to work, boy.  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  In fact, I'm coming to New Jersey.  When we toured with Kiss, I got to be pretty good friends with the cat boy. 
[01:20:30]  And he wants me to come to his place and kill the damn deer and geese because they're destroying his garden.  You're the guy to do it.  Yeah, I'm just the man.  I'm available between September and February.  That's all I do is kill stuff.  What do you do when you...  Do you ever go to restaurants?  What do you eat when you're not...  Like, when you're away?  Well, typically, you know, I started at the Ted Nugent United Sportsman of America about  14 years ago.  And I got my blood brothers in every nook and cranny of this great American experiment here.  And they've got a barbecue going whenever they hear that I'm on tour.  I'll be doing about 150 concerts this year. 
[01:21:00]  And everywhere I go, even when we...  We just got back from Sweden and Great Britain.  And even over in London, these damn Nugent TNUSA members, they actually had some red stag steaks  that they brought down.  They had a little hibachi back behind the concert.  And they were cooking me up with some flesh.  It was really kind of cute.  But I've got blood brothers everywhere.  Somebody's got something dead for Uncle Ted, no matter where I am.  Really?  Can you talk about the roadkill barbecues that some of these places have?  Well, I don't know how anybody else does it. 
[01:21:30]  But we've seen, you know, there's so many damn deer.  In fact, there's more mountain lions.  But it's more than that.  I used to live upstate New York.  They're everywhere.  And they would, I don't know, when a car hits like these animals, they kind of throw  them in a freezer and, I don't know, once a year they get these huge barbecues together  and they cook up all these animals that were hit by cars.  Well, with the Ted Nugent United Sportsmen of America and a bunch of the NRA organizations,  the Safari Club International, we've got the Hunters for the Hungry and the Farmers  feeding the homeless.  And in just the last few years, these hunting organizations have fed over 10 million meals 
[01:22:00]  of venison with the Salvation Army and various soup kitchens and homeless shelters.  And there is a surplus out there.  There's not a place in America that doesn't have too many deer.  So we need to start killing more of them and using better.  And these different organizations, including roadkills, because a lot of places, you remember  old Cuomo, the old Governor Cuomo, he made it illegal to use roadkills in the state  of New York, which is why we got Pataki and we sent Cuomo on his eternal nacho date with 
[01:22:30]  Ann Richards because, you know, this is a resource.  If you get that roadkill in time, that's some good food.  It beats the hell out of any burger you're going to find in any restaurant.  Yeah, people are starving and there's plenty of deer walking around.  Yeah, I remember I had a conversation with the old Governor Cuomo and he was telling me  how it had to be USDA approved before people could eat venison or wild game.  Meanwhile, the homeless people were scraping garbage out of dumpsters. 
[01:23:00]  And I made sure that Mario understood that.  And we passed the law when Pataki became governor because he had a bitter sense of reality and  we're real proud of that.  That's cool.  Hey, I want to hear Mike over here on the national line.  You want to go?  Ted, you want to hear somebody?  He wants to fire off his .68 caliber.  There's such a thing as a .68 caliber?  I don't know.  I think there is not.  Hey, Mike.  What's up?  What do you got?  I got a Spider Custom Built.  Spider Custom Built?  Yeah. 
[01:23:30]  And what is this?  It's a paintball gun.  Oh, stop it.  I'm trying to be cute.  Yeah, a wussy, wussy.  What are you, a Courtney Love fan?  Get rid of that crap.  I'm putting up on him.  Paintball.  What do you got?  A bunch of wussies there?  I thought this was a man's radio show.  I know.  So we'll try to redeem ourselves with Dave.  Dave.  Hey, what's up?  What do you got, Dave?  Oh, what do you want, man?  I got a .243, .30-odd, .6, .26, .50.  I got three ARs.  I got a model Uzi, .44, 12-gauge.  I got the Uzi in the AR loaded up. 
[01:24:00]  All right.  Fire off the Uzi.  All right.  Here you go.  Let me step outside.  I love your fans, man.  That'd be great.  Your fans are my fans.  All right.  Let's hear.  Here we go.  Nine millimeters.  He's going down.  Come on.  He's loading.  I like that.  There it is.  Sounds like me tuning my guitar.  All right.  There he goes.  Take the safety off.  No, no.  Yeah, nine millimeter.  That'll do.  That'll do. 
[01:24:30]  That'll do.  That's kind of a girl's round, but it'll be better.  You want the Uzi?  Hear the AR?  Yeah, let's hear the AR.  AR, 223.  That's got a little bit more horsepower.  My neighbor just pulled up across the street.  He's probably flipping out right now.  All right.  Here we go.  That's what you get for having neighbors.  Wait a minute.  We got a jam.  We got a jam.  Oh, you got a jam.  Yeah.  You got to clean the damn gun, Dave.  Get some inhibitor.  We got this inhibitor on. 
[01:25:00]  All right.  You ready?  Clean and solvent out there, man.  All right.  Go, Dave.  See, 223 is better, man.  That sounds much better like a 223.  That's good, Dave.  I love you, son.  There you be.  Thanks a lot, Dave.  Take a deep breath and suck in all that ballistic sexuality there.  That sounds great.  God, I love that.  That stuff smells great.  It's like a Broadway show on acid, man.  Ted, you got to shoot something off, Ross.  Yeah, Ted, could you shoot something?  Yeah.  Hey, Rock, are you downstairs?  You down there?  Okay, you guys, give me just a second. 
[01:25:30]  I'll run downstairs.  All right, man.  Rip me.  Hang on now.  Hell yeah.  We'll plug the book while you're going downstairs.  Hang on.  Plug the hell away.  We're talking to Ted Nugent.  His new book is called Kill It and Grill It.  He's going downstairs to shoot off some guns for us today, man.  The Guide to Preparing and Cooking Wild Game and Fish.  There you go.  Includes recipes for deer, elk, wild boar, rabbit, bear, wild turkey, duck, and more.  And there's a very attractive wife.  See, I don't have to worry about no damn neighbors.  I ain't got no damn neighbors.  Hey, Ted, I got to ask you something. 
[01:26:00]  Shot them all.  Yeah.  Are you aware that they're trying to get you to do a radio show here?  Yeah, I got requests from all over the damn country to do a real radio because I'm a funny  son of a bitch.  People want to have fun with me.  But here you go.  Now, you heard that.  I want the people in New York to listen.  One guy shot off that he actually dared to call offering a paint gun.  I mean, kiss my ass.  You know what I mean?  All right, what do you got?  That one guy shot off a 9mm Uzi.  That's a summer automatic Uzi.  That's kind of cute.  We got a couple of those.  Yeah.  And Mrs. Nugent's got one of those in her purse.  And then the ER-15, that's cute. 
[01:26:30]  We got 16 of those here.  Yeah.  But the Navy SEALs come out here a lot.  And I'm looking out over 2,000 acres of nothing short of a sacred, sacred swamp.  And I've got a Glock 10mm here.  Yeah.  And I'm just standing on my deck.  I'm looking at a beautiful lake.  And I actually see where the bluegills are bedding.  So I'll try to kill some fish while I'm doing this.  All right?  All right.  I'm putting the phone on my left ear.  You guys ready?  Ready.  Yeah.  Glock 10mm using Corbon 135 grain 10mm loads doing 1,500 feet a second. 
[01:27:00]  You ready?  All right.  This is how we handle carjackers in Detroit.  Ready, boys?  Here goes Uncle Ted 10mm man's gun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nice.  Now, that had a little bit more depth to it, didn't it?  It certainly did.  I think I killed about 20 carp just now, man.  Now, be it.  Gun, go fetch.  Go get a rake and bring in some slabs.  Oh, wow. 
[01:27:30]  Yeah.  And since I shot that, I've already put in a fresh magazine just in case.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Isn't that beautiful?  That sounded great.  No, it's a great gun.  It's got much more horsepower.  These 10mms are so much better than the 9mm, man.  Yeah?  Evan Marshall started this law enforcement test group where he's studied over, I think  it's up to a half a million shootings now.  You know, with the big Crips and Bloods party out there, you know?  The crack dealers like to shoot each other, which I'd like to just drop him some ammo. 
[01:28:00]  But he's studied all these shootings and he's discovered that this gun on my belt right  now is the number one rated one-shot stopper.  In other words, a carjacker comes, you don't have to double tap.  You just shoot him once and it's all over.  You call 911 and have him bring a broom and a dustpan.  Nice.  Water.  Beautiful.  What else you got there, man?  You got anything a little louder?  Oh, I got the .22-250, but we don't need to be shooting that off for the Manhattan folks, 
[01:28:30]  do we?  I would love it.  That's just a big varmint gun.  You know, it's no more fun than the Glock.  The Glock is more fun.  It has a better phone tone, I think.  Really?  Yeah.  I just want to hear some artillery.  Yeah.  I hear something a little bigger.  All right.  You want to hear .22-250?  Yeah.  Yeah.  That happens to be handy right here.  All right.  Let's give it a listen.  This is a Remington Model 722-250.  It's got a Leupold 6x20 scopes in case there's a scumball way out there, you know? 
[01:29:00]  Right.  It just shoots a little .55 grain bullet.  You hear that?  Oh, yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's beautiful.  That's almost as good as my guitar.  That's great.  All right.  You ready?  Yeah.  Now, there are a couple deer across the lake, but it ain't season, so I'm not going to shoot  them.  I'll just spook them a little bit.  You ready?  Yeah.  22-250, varmint load.  Real good for carjackers.  It kind of goes in like a thumb, comes out like a Frisbee.  You ready?  Hey, man. 
[01:29:30]  Let's do it.  Here you go.  Ready?  Now, shut up.  Here it is.  How's that?  Is that beautiful?  What was it like a thumb and comes out like a Frisbee?  It goes in like a thumb, comes out like a Frisbee.  You can actually talk to your gut pile while you're fading away.  You can actually fondle your pancreas in the last moments of your life.  Oh, man.  That is beautiful, Ted.  Yeah, it is.  I'm a beautiful man.  Absolutely. 
[01:30:00]  You're all right, man.  Ted Nugent.  Don't be a stranger.  We love it.  Hey, we're coming back.  You know, we're touring all summer like idiots, and Kill It and Grill It is available at TedNugent.com,  and I should be doing a book sign in Manhattan out there sometime.  My brother still lives there.  We like to come there and scare people.  Hey, Ted, I want to take a vacation and go out there and check your place out.  This is heaven.  We live in heaven.  My son, we catch bluegills every day.  We kill some big turkeys this spring.  We just got back from Europe.  We're going back to Africa.  We live.  The American dream, you don't even dare dream in these dimensions. 
[01:30:30]  Our life is so cool, it's just insane.  That's great, man.  Yeah, it is.  We're very, very lucky.  I thank God every day, and I thank you guys, too.  Thank you, Ted Nugent.  Are you still touring with kids?  No, no.  You mean opening for the cartoons?  No, not me.  No, we're just touring ourselves this year.  I got Marco Mendoza, got a brand new CD on Spitfire coming out.  Best damn dangerous rhythm and blues I've ever created.  Marco Mendoza, Tommy Clefetto's two of the most gifted virtuosos a guy could ever jam with, man.  I'm a lucky, lucky man.  Cool, Ted. 
[01:31:00]  Kill it, man.  Live.  Kill it and grill it.  All right, guys.  Pick it up, man.  Live it up, man.  Thank you, Ted.  Adios.  There you go.  Ted Nugent.  Ted Nugent.  How cool is that?  Ted firing off some of his stuff for us.  He's just great.  And he just knows everything about his guns, the game he shoots, the loads he's using in  the guns.  Very educated guy.  That's amazing.  Yeah, I love watching him argue.  I mean, there's points on both sides, but I just love watching him run right through people 
[01:31:30]  with the stupid emotional, guns kill.  And he's watching him run over them with a great argument.  He'd just go, yes, they do.  Well.  I guess that ends our shooting bit.  That was pretty good.  Although, if somebody can...  Ted Nugent's shooting.  If someone can conjure up some automatic weapons, we're always willing to listen to those.  All right.  Ted shooting them.  Now, that's celebrity gunfire right there.  Some celebrity gunfire.  That was nice.  Now, we need a bigger celebrity with bigger guns. 
[01:32:00]  Ooh.  It ain't gonna happen.  No.  No.  Hey, working hard, playing hard, America.  This is your blood brother of all things sonic bombast, Ted Nugent.  And you're listening to Opie and Anthony, my blood brothers of rock and roll.  Papa Roach.  She loves me not.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Oy.  Jim doesn't like that song.  What's the problem with that song, Jim? 
[01:32:30]  To be honest with you, I've never heard it.  Really?  It's new.  Open your mind.  My mind is wide open.  I'm not saying that they're terrible.  I've just never heard it.  Yeah, it's one of the hottest bands in the country right now.  What is a hot band?  That doesn't mean anything to me who's a hot band.  It really doesn't.  I mean, you know, ecstasy's a hot drug.  It doesn't mean I'm going to go out and do it.  I don't care about that.  Wimp.  Also, someone on the instant feedback for little Jimmy Norton.  James from Queens writes, how much of a pussy does Norton feel like after hearing a real 
[01:33:00]  man like Ted Nugent?  Ah.  Yeah, look, I like Ted Nugent, man.  And I like his honesty.  But it's kind of easy to traipse around the world with a rifle when you're worth $200 million.  I'm sorry.  I don't live on a 2,000 acre estate.  I can't run out and shoot things.  I have to eat burgers and pinch my fat like everybody else.  Have you ever been into the guns, Jim?  No.  No, I'm not.  No.  Wasn't it you that said if you had a gun in the house, you probably would have killed yourself?  Yeah, I know for a fact I would have blown my brains all over the floor. 
[01:33:30]  One of those moments where you didn't know how to put the cable into the box?  Dude, that's exactly what it is.  It's never death in the family.  It's never something very small.  It's always I can't work the TV and I can't sign online.  And look at my needy breasts.  They'd find you with your toe in the trigger.  Today he was biting his phone.  I was so happy because sprint blows.  I had trouble now not laughing at him.  And it was one of those things where, you know, Jimmy does things and we laugh. 
[01:34:00]  But it was one of those moments where he threw his phone down.  It looks like he was in need and we should have been there for him.  But we were too busy.  We turned our heads and laughed.  Like I had to turn my head.  I was afraid.  It was one of those moments, though, where I had to, like, turn my head and laugh at him.  Yeah.  Because he's throwing his phone and he's yelling at his phone as he's pounding it on the console.  And then he goes, I want to bite it.  Like you just want to put it in your mouth and bite the phone.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You want to hurt it somehow even though it's inanimate. 
[01:34:30]  I want to hurt a representative from Sprint.  Because I got hung up on one time by a supervisor.  And I don't think I've ever been that angry at another human.  If she was in front of me, I would have bit her throat.  I don't know if it's the company, though.  Cell phones, it's still a technology that's not an everywhere kind of thing.  We have a ship that can circle the Earth in 90 minutes.  We can certainly fix enough towers.  That's the problem.  There's not enough towers.  You couldn't have used the we went to the moon one? 
[01:35:00]  No, I don't want to use the moon.  It's a little more impressive than just orbiting the Earth.  It's not.  And what ship can circle the Earth in 90 minutes?  The Challenger to $17,000.  Oh, I thought you were talking like a boat or something.  A ship?  No, 1930s.  I'm not talking about a boat.  Well, when you say ship, you're not talking about the space shuttle.  You're talking about like an ocean liner.  There's an old tug out there.  I really stink.  A spacecraft.  Hey, we should say hi to Steve Dahl.  Steve Dahl.  We're being very rude by not introducing him to our audience. 
[01:35:30]  The Challenger doesn't orbit anything anymore.  You know what?  That one blew up.  Absolutely right.  Thank you.  Thank you.  See?  We don't even look at things like that anymore when Jimmy talks.  We have a ship that can blow up within 70 seconds.  Good point.  You didn't even realize it.  He's a cell phone thing.  No, it's an endeavor.  Endeavor, right.  Oh, that's one of them.  Good.  That's the no, but Mr. Dahl's right.  Mr. Dahl, look at you showing respect.  Very respectful.  You even know who he is?  Of course. 
[01:36:00]  I'm not up on all of them.  He's been rubbing me all over ever since I got here, really.  Yeah.  I'm rubbing my leg.  He'll do that.  You got a picture with Steve Dahl?  That's me by you, Ozzy.  Oh, he did.  No, he did.  He did.  First thing.  He asks everyone that.  That's not a joke.  He asks everybody that's famous.  No, Ozzy?  Do you know Ozzy?  He's such an...  And I did.  He's the biggest Ozzy fan.  And you did.  He had a story.  Interviewed him, like, in the early 80s, and he had a big, like, a giant Ziploc bag of  blow that he, during the interview, at a radio station, just sat there and... 
[01:36:30]  Boy, a guy doing a blow at a radio station in the 80s.  What a surprise.  Out in the open, anyway.  Isn't it amazing what some of the guests can get away with just because they're guests?  It was 90 degrees out.  He had a fur coat on, sweating profusely, and was just doing blow, and he was playing  Celebrity Jeopardy.  He had, like, a version of that.  Yeah.  And he could not comprehend the question and the answer being backwards, and he just  gave up and left.  He just left. 
[01:37:00]  I don't understand this, man.  How am I supposed to answer with a question if it's a question?  I'll be honest.  I think I'll do some more blow.  That's your hero, Jim.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  He's off that stuff now, though.  I'm just saying.  I love the fact that he did blow, and you know what Ozzy talks about?  He's not, like, one of these little faggues.  Hold on.  Hold on.  What's wrong with you?  You just dropped the big F-bomb.  What's wrong with you?  They had to dump out.  I didn't mean to curse.  All we heard was khaki shorts.  Khaki shorts what?  No, no, no. 
[01:37:30]  I said fag celebrities.  No, I didn't curse.  No, you did.  I will absolutely say that you've said an F-bomb.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  I'm ready on my sphincter titans when I hear profanity.  You get all nervous.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to curse.  You're just talking now, see?  Yeah.  You're all revved up with Ozzy.  So what's the story?  He's honest.  He doesn't.  A point I was making is he's not one of these little baggy nouveau rockers with a message.  He's honest, and that's why I like him.  That's true.  I didn't have any joke.  His message is he has no message. 
[01:38:00]  Exactly, but that's honest.  He does blow, and he lives with his wife and his kids, and he's a good dad.  He doesn't do blow anymore.  Whatever.  Now, he's off that stuff now.  Okay, I hope so.  This was back in the 80s.  I hope so.  Imagine how much he'd shake if he was still on it.  Oh, man.  That's like shaking, just trying to work his remote.  He wouldn't be able to get it up into his nose, because he'd keep falling off the spoon.  Warren, I can't get the coke into my nose, Sharon.  He wouldn't shake if I sat there and just held him.  And you would, Jimmy.  He blew it up his nose for him as a straw.  I'm doing it with respect. 
[01:38:30]  You've got to relapse if you're just helping a legend.  Hey, I've got to ask Steve Dahl.  Did you like the tuna?  Oh, it was excellent.  You guys are known for your tuna here.  I had a problem with him recommending.  I was like, it's kind of difficult when Opie recommended the tuna.  I'm sitting there going, uh-oh.  He's just trying to be nice.  I keep my mouth shut, because if you recommend something and it sucks, he will then always be  the guy that sucks at picking food.  Well, tuna's a weird thing, because it's so raw inside.  Then maybe you're not into that, and Opie recommended it. 
[01:39:00]  Guys, look at me.  Am I not into, I mean, you can see I like to eat, so I'm into just about everything.  That was really good.  It was great.  I just like the fact that Ken Stevens picked up the check.  From his usual table.  It sat there on the table for a little while.  Did you see how nervous?  I thought he wanted me to take that.  I know.  That's what I was thinking.  I'm like, is Ken waiting for Steve to pick that up?  Because they put it down right in front of you.  And I'm like, is Ken honestly waiting for Steve to pick that up?  And then I'm getting embarrassed.  I'm sitting there going, maybe I should pick this up. 
[01:39:30]  Yeah, and then you go around the table.  Wait, you think he wants Opie to pick this up?  And then I thought if I would pick it up, Opie's going to grab it, because I'll just sit  back and then he'll do it, because I know he's feeling uncomfortable.  If he thinks Ken thinks you're picking up.  Plus he's got the tuna thing on his head, so there's a lot going on there.  And I just had the cheap pasta, so I didn't want to have to divvy up.  Why should you?  No, we talk about that all the time.  I don't care.  If I have a glass of water and a salad, I'll still split the check.  I can't stand when we go to a restaurant and there's somebody picking up. 
[01:40:00]  But I had this and that.  I want to wrap them in the head.  The easiest way, you divvy it all up.  We're not in high school anymore at the diner, you know, where you've got to pick  out and went to change.  Mine was $4.38.  That big tipper.  You know, someone brought it, and it always ends up the last guy in line.  Which, thank God, is usually Opie.  I can't tell.  Gets the pile of money that everybody got collected and gives it to Opie.  Opie counts it up and goes, all right, I'm only like $130 short. 
[01:40:30]  No, no.  I wish.  That would have been good.  I would have taken that bullet.  How much was it that day?  It was $300 short.  $300 short.  Oh, in Boston?  The last Boston trip.  $300 short.  And I had, like, a glass of wine and an appetizer.  And then I'm like this.  I'm like, hello, we're $300 short, and everyone makes me believe they're not listening.  Everyone goes, I was in.  Well, we didn't do it because Tim Laws was ordering 13th century wine, and then he leaves.  He was ordering some of Napoleon's private stock. 
[01:41:00]  He was.  This wine.  It was something like $100, $200 a bottle or something.  It was at least $200 a bottle.  And he's just ordering it up.  Because his girlfriend was drunk, and he's ordering this crazy wine.  Yeah, they run out like Natalie Wood and William Holden, and we're sitting there owing $1,000.  That's the truth.  But that's why whenever I would be at restaurants before this job or anything, like when I was with friends at the diner or something, I'd always pull out more money than my check was for and make a point of going, I'm in for $20. 
[01:41:30]  And I'd put it down and know that no matter what the discrepancy was, I'm in the clear.  You're good.  I don't have to turn around then and make it like I didn't pay.  Dude, Patrice, he's a comedian friend of mine, and a couple got the worst with that.  Well, but I didn't mean just, you're an entertainer.  Can you for once act like you're living good?  Can you just stop being a cheap scumbag?  And I hope you're listening, you awful tipper.  That drives me nuts.  I can see if one guy eats nothing and three guys have steak, that's different. 
[01:42:00]  But if we all eat, just put the money in.  Just throw it in.  Act like you have a pair.  Even then, I don't care.  Wait, you were bothered by the Boston thing, though, because we were way short.  Well, the difference is when I don't drink alcohol, and if I eat something, I'll always, I'll always, I'm not cheap at all.  I always just put my money in.  But if there's a bottle of wine that's $150 or $200, that's different, because that's an expense I will make.  That is kind of a borderline thing.  I'm just thinking.  I'm not talking about regular drinks.  I don't care.  I don't care what I'm doing or what I'm eating.  I'll always split just for the fact that you're kind of with the company. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what?  You're not just paying for the food.  You're there.  You're having fun with everybody.  Make it even.  It's not as difficult.  But it's their job not to order a $200 bottle of wine.  If someone orders the $200 bottle of wine, they better go, I'm putting in the extra two beans for this wine.  And then put it down.  But those people usually don't.  I understand if someone's buying a bottle, you're not drinking.  But I mean, you know, a $200 bottle of wine.  And then two of them.  I'm not talking about...  Our bill was over $1,000 that night for just a few people. 
[01:43:00]  We had appetizers and this wine.  That was it.  Right next to the Boston Celtics.  Yes.  Before they lost horribly.  I used to go out to brunch in Huntington.  Right there where Opie lives.  Out to brunch and...  You say where you live?  Well...  Well, that's a mistake.  That's where he used to live.  All right.  Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.  Oh, yeah, Huntington.  Yeah, yeah.  So that's the place.  And I was always...  Ted Nugent is my landlord. 
[01:43:30]  Hold on.  Psycho Tim wants to tell his side of the story.  Here's the $200 bottle of wine.  We go over this all the time.  Tim.  What's up, dude?  What's up?  Well, you're right.  The bottles of wine were expensive.  Because Opie gave me crap about the stuff that I bought before.  The $30 bottle of wine was too below everybody.  You know what?  In all fairness, the next day, Tim made good.  Oh, he did?  Yes.  Well, I had one other problem.  My girlfriend was blacked out.  So I had to...  I had to get into the clinic to get her stomach pumped. 
[01:44:00]  Stop it.  No joke.  Her eyes were like slot machines that night.  Yeah, she becomes Chinese very quickly.  Isn't it true that she crawled into your bed in high heels?  Yeah.  Well, she does that a lot anyway, though.  Yeah.  Dude, I would kill for a relationship like that.  They just drink until they can't even stand.  You jump on, and they remember none of it.  Exactly.  That's great.  And then it only costs you half your money when you go to leave that relationship.  But at least you know I made good, because I was sorry about the next day.  I was truly sorry about that.  No, I was all right.  I've never welched on a... 
[01:44:30]  No, no, no.  Tim doesn't care about money.  That relationship's all hot and fun for the first three months.  That's the difference.  It becomes quite a burden.  You got caught up in how good it felt when you bought the ring.  I wasn't talking about me.  Oh, yeah.  Neither am I talking about you, either.  I'm just saying you, meaning theoretically you.  I'm just talking about any guy that might be in a relationship with a girl that tends  to get hammered a lot.  Oh, please.  You know, it's all well and fine at the beginning of the relationship.  You're with the party girl, getting hammered, doesn't matter, wild.  And then after a while it becomes, you know, hey, I'm trying to watch TV and you're falling 
[01:45:00]  in the front door.  You know, perhaps there's a problem.  Exactly.  You don't ever let them fall in the front door.  Exactly.  You buy liquor and you leave Boston Cream Donut on face and you boot out.  But I'm too drunk to drive.  Well, then you should have thought of that before you shouldn't you.  Out.  You're a hell of a guy, man.  Psycho Tim, you done?  Yep.  Psychotim.com, right?  Yep.  All right.  Later, guys.  Peace.  Steve Dahl's stalker's on the line.  Oh, no. 
[01:45:30]  Pia?  You know a Pia?  Yes, I do.  Unfortunately or fortunately?  You know, she's safely.  I'm in Chicago.  She's in Washington.  So that's good.  Oh, that's always good.  State or D.C.?  D.C.  Is she hot?  Sure.  No, she's a mess.  No.  So is your mom.  Oh.  You really did zing him.  Wow.  She's talking about your mama.  You know, nothing like a feisty stalker.  See, we made a mistake with our stalker.  We invited her into the studio. 
[01:46:00]  She's really nuts.  Yeah, I heard that.  Oh, yeah, she's nuts.  And she was living under the stairs that you passed through to come down here?  She was actually living there.  And then we finally realized that it might be a problem, and we had to do something very drastic.  Hey, I have one in Boston that thinks I'm her father.  Oh, that's right.  I heard that one, too.  Yeah, she's great.  My stalker pales in comparison to your stalker's.  Yeah, Pia, what do you do as a stalker?  I go to all his vacation clubs.  Even though she can't hear me?  I fly in and see his concerts.  She can't hear my show because I'm only on in Chicago. 
[01:46:30]  Right.  So I don't know how she knows.  Yeah, how do you know about Steve Dahl if you don't even listen to him?  No, I listen to him on the Internet illegally.  Oh.  Illegal broadcast.  Five, three, six, five.  All right.  We don't like giving out addresses because they get really, really mad at Westwood One.  Are you attractive?  I have big boobs.  So what?  So do I have a lot of monsters?  I mean, do you have a good-looking girl?  So does Al Roker.  Why didn't I think of that?  That's a funny line.  Like meatloaf in Fight Club.  Yeah.  The big man boobs. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  So, Pia, you're kind of a mess, huh?  I don't think so.  So what do you go to his vacation places?  What do you mean by that?  Well, tell them, Steve.  Well, you know, we'd like take trips and broadcast, and she comes along and gets...  Last time I saw her, she was in Hawaii.  And I threw off.  And you would have liked her because she had actually passed out by the pool.  Oh, that's handy.  You could wash off the evidence.  Well, it depends on what she looks like.  Were people carving their initials in you and trying to push you back into the water? 
[01:47:30]  Pia, how do you afford this?  It's probably a lot of money to go to Hawaii.  Um, you know, I'm going to say, you know, maybe I sell drugs, okay?  Oh, maybe.  Hey, Pia, I've got to ask you something.  Yeah.  Were you the one that gave Stalker Patty all my addresses and phone numbers?  No, no, no, no, no.  Uh-huh.  That was a good one.  Actually, Pia spends a lot of time talking to my wife.  Oh, God.  Are you going to tell them that?  Well, I go online.  So I'm not sure what's going on there, but it sounds like a train of way might be in my future. 
[01:48:00]  All right.  Hey, call the New York Post.  That's always fun when it ends up in that paper there, Steve.  Way to go, Anthony.  That's a fun one.  That's always good when the paper is in there for a divorce testimony, and here's that one.  Nice.  I'm not talking about me.  No, just if it would ever happen.  I'm talking about it, regardless if the picture was in the paper.  All right, Pia.  What else you got?  Nothing, huh?  We had a good lunch today, because I know you emailed asking.  Yeah, thanks.  I had the tuna.  Okay.  It was excellent.  I hope you recommend it. 
[01:48:30]  The waitress.  And the hot news reader from CNN was in there.  Oh, yeah.  What's her name again?  Darren Kagan.  I had a dream about having sex with her, like, a couple nights ago, and then she was in the restaurant.  Yeah.  But, you know, I didn't have sex with her.  I had the tuna, though.  She was in the worst position for the peak.  She was in a booth, and she's facing our table.  And Opie looks and goes, isn't she on CNN?  I'm like, I don't know.  And the second I looked, she locked eyes, and it was like, oh, she saw me.  But, yeah.  And I was like, ah, they're all looking. 
[01:49:00]  And Steve's back was to her.  And Opie goes, yeah, she's right back there.  And you don't even care.  You just turned around.  You're looking like he's looking for a friend that's supposed to be there.  Hello?  Where?  I don't see her, guys.  I don't see her.  Which booth is that?  CNN, you're short?  I love that channel.  She looks hotter on TV.  Well, they make them all off.  In person, I think her forehead's a little short.  That was a weird statement he made.  He goes, yeah, her forehead's too short, but she had, like, long bangs going, which is kind of, you know, kind of cute. 
[01:49:30]  The fact that her forehead might be a little shorter than the average person.  I think you'd get less bangs if you want.  Doesn't TV add, like, an inch to your forehead?  An inch to your forehead.  Is that it?  It makes your forehead fat.  There's ways of covering up your faults.  And I think she grew her hair that way to cover up a short forehead.  I'm convinced.  I don't know.  I thought she looked fine.  She looked all right to me.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Hey, we all know that Opie splits his bill all the time. 
[01:50:00]  He even does it with his girlfriend.  Well, she's got to earn her keep.  I think she already did.  Wasn't there one time Opie and his girlfriend went to a restaurant?  And Opie explains it this way, that she had all the money on her.  Oh, no.  Opie didn't have the money on him.  And that's the truth.  But, you know, it's your guy's money.  It's not, you know, like it's your first date and she's doling out the cash.  So she pulls the money out of her purse. 
[01:50:30]  No, it's even worse because I was with our good friend Jay, Jay from Framingham, who's  now Jay from White Plains.  Is he a stalker, too?  Well, he started that way up in Boston, yeah.  Yeah, and then we invited him to come on the show and we hit it off.  Turned into a cool guy.  You know what?  I never thought of it that way.  I think he's a stalker.  Be careful at the Christmas party.  That's all I'm saying.  So it was Jay and I and Sandy sitting across from us and a little restaurant in this town  I don't live in, starts with an age, north shore of Long Island, and we were having dinner 
[01:51:00]  and at the end of the night, Jay and I flipped to see who was going to pay the bill.  Ah.  We flipped a quarter.  And I think I lost and I didn't have my money on me saying I had all the money, so I go  saying, you know, we've got to pay for this.  And there was some scumbag, a vulture sitting, waiting, just looking at prey.  A vulture looking around and he sees Sandy go into her purse and pull out money to pay 
[01:51:30]  for these two schleps, these two freeloaders that should have been treating her like a queen  and she's footing the bill.  And the guy makes his move.  He made a move.  Now, he didn't have the balls to make the move himself, though.  He made a move, though.  He was with another couple and had the girl leave Sandy a little note.  A note.  Saying, hey, if you want a dinner where you don't have to pay, here's my number.  This is where I work.  This is where I live.  What a scumbag. 
[01:52:00]  So what happened?  This is my mule size.  Actually, the way that finished was really good.  And, yeah, it was a great, well, Steve Dahl could appreciate this.  We turned into a great radio bit.  Great radio bit that I don't think we could ever play again.  No, no, no.  Did you hook up with that guy?  Well, he bugged out before you saw the note.  Or you'd have killed him.  I would have.  No, I was really pissed.  The girl drops the business card with all this info.  By the time she read it, told me what was going on, I kind of got up and was like, 
[01:52:30]  what the F, you know, and he was long gone.  Yeah.  But he didn't have the balls to, like, hand it to her personally.  So she has no clue.  Let's say she was single.  She has no clue what the guy looked like.  He screwed up.  But his phone number's on there, his name, everything.  So, of course, he doesn't know he's screwing over a guy that has a radio show.  It's a big transmitter between your legs there.  Right.  So we got this girl that had the sexiest voice.  Yeah.  The sexiest voice.  And she calls, as my girlfriend, and just, I mean, I'm home alone. 
[01:53:00]  I'm naked.  You want to come over.  I got your card.  And, yeah, you know.  You're right.  Yeah, the guys I was with.  Oh, yeah.  All I want to do is get F'd.  And I'm not getting any.  I'm not getting any.  And he was totally going for it.  Totally going for it.  And then there's all those wacky rules about how to tell him he's on the air.  Oh, yeah.  You know how that stuff goes.  You know, he wasn't informed that he was on the air. 
[01:53:30]  No, he pushed out in the end, though.  Yeah, he looked even worse because he didn't want to close the deal.  Yeah, we made it sound like this girl was ready and just waiting.  Ready to go.  For him to show up.  And he was like, oh, well, this is not what I was looking for.  Maybe, yeah, maybe the girl came on a little too heavy.  It was almost like, is this a prostitute?  Is this going to cost me like three grand when she leaves my house?  Are they taping this?  Well, yeah, that one's right.  Correct.  All right. 
[01:54:00]  What a sweet guy.  But you got to play it once at least, right?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, what a scumbag, man.  Guys are just vultures.  It's so difficult to, it's like you're walking around with raw meat in a lion's den.  You got to just watch all the time.  They're always ready to just pounce.  But that's the type of guy you want to see somebody swing a chair into his teeth.  Oh, yeah.  That's why guys...  You're very violent, man.  No, I wouldn't do it.  You're a non-violent guy.  I want to see somebody do it.  He does nothing.  He just wants to watch.  I don't claim to do anything. 
[01:54:30]  I don't run around going, oh, I'll beat you.  Nothing.  Just a stupid comic.  All right.  Big mouth.  We got to take a break.  Steve, you got to hang out for a little longer because we got to talk about the representation  of Chicago in this WOW Contest.  Okay.  Sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm here.  That's why I'm here.  I'm ready to work.  I know it's tomorrow, but...  Yeah.  It's going to take me a while to get my shirt off, so I'm just going to start...  No, no.  That would be funny, though.  We're still stupid.  Well, if that's what it takes to get good ratings, we'll continue being stupid. 
[01:55:00]  We don't care.  We don't care.  I've been expecting you to make exactly that asinine statement.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Theater of the Mindless.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show today.  Steve Dahl in the studio, Anthony.  Hey, hey, hey.  From WCKG in Chicago.  Yeah, right on, my man.  Yeah.  Rockin' and rollin'.  With the shitty baby. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah, we were trying to find the gayest song earlier.  Yeah, people are still on that?  Sort of.  Well, we didn't come to a conclusion.  Billy, don't be a hero?  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  How far back do you want to go?  Because, you know...  You can go as far back as you want.  We were going back to, what, Cher songs?  That's not a gay song.  Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves is like that.  Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves.  That wasn't too bad.  It's about half-breed.  Huh?  Half-breed.  Half-breed.  Half-breed, that's right.  You know what, though?  And she would sing that in a little Indian outfit on Mike Douglas or something. 
[01:56:00]  Good stuff.  Wearing a little Pocahontas outfit.  She was beautiful back then.  Cher was beautiful.  Yeah.  And then she decided to make her face look like a doll.  I think she's 50-something.  If Mike did that show when they were teenagers, to Joey Heatherton and all of that.  The lovely Joey Heatherton, yeah.  And Charo would come out and her big cans.  Coochie, coochie.  Sure.  Lola Falana.  Lola Falana.  You want a little dark meat, you know. 
[01:56:30]  Cafe latte.  A little cafe latte.  I've always been an Eartha Kitt fan.  Eartha Kitt.  Awful.  A jaw like a steam shovel.  I don't remember what she looked like.  I just figured it would be an obscure name.  But, of course, you have all the facts.  I should know.  The guy that doesn't even own a television set.  I got a TV now, man.  But I just, I T-vote all the Osbournes and I'm watching them slowly.  I'm enjoying them like a fine wine.  It's great.  All right.  Dave, what's going on? 
[01:57:00]  Oh, hey.  How you doing, boy?  I'm pretty good.  Hey, you're talking about a dude trying to pick up your girlfriend in the restaurant.  Yeah.  I take my chick out to this restaurant and we, you know, finish up.  We get the doggy bag, you know, a little styrofoam thing with the lid.  I go home.  A couple hours later, I go in the fridge, get something to eat.  I flip it up.  The waiter had written a little note to my girlfriend.  Oh.  He's like, I don't know what your situation is, but I really want to hook up with you.  Here's my name and number.  Give me a call.  You always got to watch your back.  So what'd you do?  Did you call him? 
[01:57:30]  I jumped in the car, drove right over to the restaurant, walked in, showed it to the manager.  Dude got fired.  He went out back to get into his car and I beat the crap out of him.  I don't believe that you beat him up.  No, I don't believe that.  No, I swear to God.  Did you really?  Not kidding around.  I just was so little.  We'd been drinking all night.  I don't believe the part about beating him up.  You sound like a sweet, darling angel, but I mean, it's possible you couldn't.  Oh, angelized.  I love you, but come on. 
[01:58:00]  All right, Dave.  Thank you.  Thanks, all of you.  Later.  I'm distracted because we got the latest contestant in the WOW contest up.  Another lady from Sacramento.  What do we love?  Oh, no.  Sacramento kind of.  What happened in Sacramento?  They were so strong in the Naughty Nighty contest.  Steve Dahl said hot.  Yeah.  I said WOW, actually, which is.  Oh, you said WOW.  I'm sorry.  Well, that's why you call it that, right?  Well, let me see.  Well, she's hotter than the representation from Chicago, Steve.  Yeah, I don't know what's going on there. 
[01:58:30]  One of the girls showed up for the WOW contest in Chicago with a. . .  She was drinking a Cosmopolitan or a margarita or something.  This girl kind of looks like Jennifer Jason Leigh if she was mainlining yeast.  You are horrible, man.  She has nice cans, though, like Tracy Lourdes in 84.  With the, uh, the four's paperwork, yeah, man.  The big pink ones.  Yeah, big slow fade.  The slow fade.  Nice chick.  Heavy.  Well.  You like the slow fade, too?  I like them all, man, but I like heavy, big, heavy bullets, but firm bullets. 
[01:59:00]  Teardrops are nice, too.  Don't get me wrong.  I'll take anything.  I'll take one missing, and, you know, it doesn't matter.  You know, you wouldn't mind this chick at all if it was one of those nights out.  You know.  Hey, let me see again.  Maybe I had a bad angle on the picture.  No, she's not bad.  That's a biased picture, because she's holding them up.  Well, she's covering up her little belly.  And you can't see, like, the belly or the sides.  Okay.  The belly's okay.  She can't do the show.  That pose tells me two things.  Yeah.  So, yes, Chris.  She's got a little belly, like you just said. 
[01:59:30]  Yeah.  And she's holding up the boobs.  And she's a little afraid that they might sag.  Go to the other picture, though.  That might show off a little more of her body.  Oh, right.  Look at the poor girl.  She's a little worried about her belly.  That's all.  Yeah, go there.  No, the bottom one.  The bottom one.  Yeah, the bottom.  No, the bottom picture, where she has more of her body.  I want to see.  See, that's okay.  Wow.  Whoever took this picture is great.  Yeah.  He took it at the perfect angle that you really don't see that she's.  I've got to stop being picky.  She's not that bad.  Right. 
[02:00:00]  I think you're beating hard on her.  See?  You are.  Yeah, she's not that bad.  Thank you.  You're right.  I'm going to go back to, wow.  Yeah, she's not that bad.  That's not bad.  I'm not being polite either.  I would definitely, definitely give her a few bucks.  Boy, there's a surprise.  Dude, I'm actually pickier than you think.  No, you're not.  All right.  I'm going to try to have one moment of dignity.  You had a trainee do, you know.  What's a trainee?  A trainee.  A trainee?  What?  A tranny.  Oh, whatever.  There's a big difference.  A trainee or a tranny, man. 
[02:00:30]  Big difference.  Leslie.  Leslie, what's up?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Hey.  Hey, I want to say hello to...  All right, hold on.  Let's slow down here.  Leslie.  How many...  I don't know many Lesleys that are guys.  Leslie Nielsen.  I know.  That's the obvious one.  Gold?  Name another one.  Gold.  Oh.  Hopi.  Yeah.  It's Left Lane.  Huh?  Left Lane.  My name is Left Lane.  Left Lane? 
[02:01:00]  That's it.  Because he's a trucker.  There you go.  Friend of Bobby Big Riggers.  I want to say hello to Steve Dahl.  I used to live out in Chicago.  I used to live to him on the packets.  Hey, how are you doing?  I'm doing okay.  Nice to hear you there in New York there.  Nice to be here.  Yeah.  He's on vacation.  Decided to stop by and do some radio.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what you do on vacation.  Get right off my trip now.  Yeah.  Well, I got to say about what Steve Dahl is.  Dude, you got to come off afternoon drive and let ONA be on afternoon drive in Chicago.  Get out of here.  Yeah, come on. 
[02:01:30]  He sucked out there.  Why don't you call up and insult Steve Dahl, dude?  Turned very quickly on me there.  Don't they turn so quick and you want to smash him in the head?  He was tricking us, Steve.  He fooled us.  He fooled us there.  And we still don't know another guy named Leslie.  He was Left Lane.  True.  So, I'm still looking at this.  Look at this.  I think she's these.  The T.F.  Right?  They're.  You would.  That's the kind of girl that you would just meet.  Maybe the Sacramento girl.  Meet in the bar.  Right? 
[02:02:00]  She's kind of built like a Rand Barkley.  She's got those shoulders.  Man, you guys are tough.  I'm not taking off my shirt in here.  No, dude.  I'm not even knocking her.  She's just got like big strong shoulders.  I think her breasts are very polite.  She'd probably take you apart in bed, though.  I know.  She would.  Right?  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with that.  Let's go to this.  Hey, Seth.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  Hey.  My guard is a Norton guard.  I just want to start off with that.  Okay.  Number 35 and number 14. 
[02:02:30]  I'm away from my computer.  Are they from Chicago?  35.  14 is from Washington.  What is that?  And she's very lovely, 14.  Doesn't that not look like Ron Howard's brother with a rack?  Oh, yes.  Clint?  14 is Clint.  It doesn't look like Clint Howard.  It looks like Clint Howard with a ring.  Wow, dude.  Look at that.  That's very good.  Contestant number 14.  That is Clint Howard.  There you go.  Another contestant that's going to be mad at us, by the way.  Well, I think she's good, too. 
[02:03:00]  She's got beautiful boobs.  Yes.  I heard number 35 was trying to get a deal with Nugent to be on his next video.  She just couldn't decide if she wanted to be tied to the hood of his truck or on the table  with an apple in her mouth.  Oh, man.  You see, no wonder the girls are not really running.  I'm thinking that might have something to do with it.  This is why.  Because they're too mean.  Well, which one?  Well, she called our show yesterday and we gave her the business.  Oh, is that the one you read, the riot act, too?  Yes.  Oh, she took a lot of bunk.  A treadmill and a set of braces. 
[02:03:30]  And then the email exploded.  One guy goes, it looks like she washed her face with a beehive.  All right, guys, I'm punching out.  Let's do it.  And then another guy goes, because the boyfriend was on the phone, too, yesterday, Anthony?  Yeah.  Guy writes in an email.  I would love to give the guy credit, but it's back in the back office.  He goes, does her boyfriend have glaucoma?  You know, we've got to be nice.  Because you guys are kind of harsh on some of these.  I mean, they're making the effort.  They're coming down.  Opie's very overcritical with these girls. 
[02:04:00]  I can pick out a lot of girls.  Who's overcritical with 35?  With 35?  You have a point on 35.  All right.  All right.  I was being nice yesterday when they were on the phone.  Well, show me another one.  Okay.  Show me another one.  I already showed you the girl with the glasses that you were bashing that I think she was okay.  But hold on.  I said I made a mistake with the girl with glasses.  Here's another one I don't think is that bad.  What's wrong with her?  You were tearing her up. 
[02:04:30]  I'll tell you why.  She's holding up her arms to take the sag away.  All right.  Here's one with her arms down.  Let me see the one with your arms down.  You know, I'm talking about a world of hurt or okay.  I think she's cute.  She's got little black stuff under her eyes like Bucky Dent before he hit that three-run home run.  Boston, you suck.  Look, see?  That's kind of like, you know, hey, she's sprawled out.  She's ready to rock.  I think that looks nice.  That kind of thing, right?  She's got a little too much skank for me. 
[02:05:00]  Too much skank?  Just a little too much.  I like a little skank.  She looks, she's clean.  You're looking at the stuff on the monitor screen.  She looks, look.  She looks somebody else's skank.  Yeah.  Look, see?  She looks dirty.  She's clean.  What's wrong with a little dirty, Oak?  I said I like a little skank.  I think there's a little too much skank there.  I don't think there's, nah, not at all.  There's never enough skank.  Really?  There's an umbilical cord hanging out.  It's fine.  Wow.  Hey, Keith, you're next on the O.P. and Anthony show.  Hey, is this guy the new mid-morning guy? 
[02:05:30]  He's just kind of hanging, man.  He's hanging out.  Why can't people just hang out?  Well, I don't know.  He's a radio guy from Chicago.  I don't think that was an insult, actually.  I think the guy was saying why he's here.  No, I know.  Yeah, but it's like, I know it's not an insult, but it's interesting.  We should explain to Steve Dahl that this radio station in New York City is an absolute  mess.  So anyone that comes walking in here that has a brain on them, they're assuming he's the  guy that's going to be next in mid-days.  And anyone, even if you've repaired radios sometime in your career and you walk in here, 
[02:06:00]  people are like, it's got to be the new guy.  Dude, thank God you're here.  It's got to be the new guy.  We've got a lot of new guys walking around.  All right, she's a little weird.  Who?  It's one of the Dallas girls.  Which one?  Which one?  See, what are you thinking with that?  I like her a lot.  See?  Now, why?  Well, what contestant?  It looks like something in the microwave that's just about ready to blow. 
[02:06:30]  Yes.  Yeah, she's got weird boobies.  She's got Jiffy Pop popcorn boobs.  Nice.  This team, Jill from Dallas, Texas.  Yeah, could you put on a bigger one so you can see the body as the breast is proportioned  to the stomach and the hips and all that?  All right.  How about that?  She's pretty, though.  She's solid.  She's got to be a dancer.  Oh, nice hips.  Yeah, that big for the hips.  Roomie?  Yeah, she's definitely there.  Hey, Kevin, what's going on?  What's up, boys?  Hey.  I was in Meehan's on Saturday night with a bunch of friends.  Hey, Meehan's. 
[02:07:00]  We got there late night.  We were hanging out in the back in the boots, and there was this chick at the bar, and she  kept staring at me.  Now, I got red hair, and I look similar to you, but I don't think I look that much like  you.  So, she comes over to the table, and she goes, aren't you the guy on the radio?  And I tell her, no, and my friend Dave starts cracking up.  Now, when he starts laughing, she starts thinking I'm lying to her.  So, no matter what I do, I tell this girl like ten times, I'm not you, I'm not you.  She refuses to believe me.  Two hours later, I'm in the parking lot with the old strawberries on one pen getting oral 
[02:07:30]  treats from this girl.  She will not believe me.  I kept going to do it.  I even showed her my license.  She wouldn't believe me.  Maybe she thought you were Danny Bonaduce with the red hair.  Do you have a big mule there, Kevin?  Hello.  Do you have a big mule?  It's not good.  Oh, boy.  I'd say you got a good app on that one.  Oh, dude.  You didn't represent me well.  See, if you're going to be using radio guys' names to get sex, you better be good. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  And you better be huge.  I tried so hard not to let her believe that I was him, because I didn't want anything  to do with that.  But my friend Dave was cracking up the whole time.  How great is that, dude?  That's classic.  That makes me want to run around with a blonde wig.  I just wish the guy was, you know, I wish he had a big one there.  It's big enough to be happy.  Oh, boy.  Go to the mountains, that's for sure.  Did the girl complain?  No, no complaints.  No complaints?  What do you mean bigger than mine?  How do you know how big my mule is? 
[02:08:30]  I'll put it this way.  When I went to finish, she accepted it.  Good girl.  Ah, there you go.  That's kind of a girl you got.  Shot and a goal.  Shot and a goal.  That's nice.  All right, boys.  Thank you.  All right.  There you go.  That's where you hold their head and you say, take me.  Take me.  Is that what you do?  Is that what you do?  They can't hear you because you have your fingers in their ears.  Like corn on the cob.  What?  Like corn on the cob.  Yeah. 
[02:09:00]  Do you say that?  I was just completely disgusted.  Take me.  Or take it, yeah.  Take it.  Take it, yeah.  When you said that, I actually went up inside myself.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm just, I'm disgusted by that.  One hand on the neck and one on the back of the head.  This is everybody a good lesson.  I just hope she gagged at least once.  Oh, yeah.  Take it.  I hope he was uncut with warts.  One of these days, you're going to get in trouble for that.  All of a sudden, some chick will be saying that, yeah, I did this with Opie and, you know, 
[02:09:30]  the other thing and that and it's his kid.  Yeah, right.  And then what?  Yeah, they test.  It's easy.  No, I didn't test the butts of beauty of living in 2002.  They could test it.  You sound like you've had some experience.  Never do.  No?  I think I'm startled to be running off of you.  I've never got to.  No, yeah, right.  I don't know about that.  Marion.  Yeah?  Hi, how you doing?  All right.  How you doing, Opie?  Hi, Anthony.  One hand on the guitar to Laverne and Shirley.  Would you at least say hello to Mr. Doll? 
[02:10:00]  He's a radio legend.  Hey, hi, Jim.  How you doing?  No.  Say hi to who?  Steve Doll.  Stupid.  Oh, hi, Steve.  How you doing?  Good.  How are you?  I'm okay.  All right.  What's going on, guys?  And her cohort.  Yeah.  Marion, how's Lady Di been doing?  Oh, she's all right, I guess.  Yeah?  I talked to her this afternoon.  I haven't talked to her all weekend except for today.  Was she drunk?  No.  She called me from work.  Oh, there she is.  She has to work this week.  I'm right over here. 
[02:10:30]  Now, Lady Di.  Yes.  You know you took your test.  Right.  Last week.  Right.  The listeners were voting.  You have to remember one thing.  You're stupid.  It's been 22 years since I took any kind of test.  This wasn't a test about stuff you learned years ago.  This was a test that I think...  Exactly.  You forget something.  No.  Hey, idiot.  Listen to me.  You should be kicked out of the country because of your lack of knowledge.  It was a test of knowledge that anybody living in this country should know.  You thought Columbus came here in the 1800s. 
[02:11:00]  You don't.  1892.  That one I was kidding about.  No, you weren't.  Oh, sure you weren't.  I was kidding about that one.  No, you weren't.  You couldn't name one...  Hey, Joe.  You listen to this?  You couldn't name one astronaut.  Well, that's true.  I could not name one astronaut because you forget.  No one forgets one American astronaut.  Okay.  You should know that.  Hey, Opie Anthony.  Yes, Marion.  I forget a lot of things, too, and I'm a high school graduate.  Are you sticking up for her now?  No, no.  I do.  I'm serious.  What happened?  I never went to college. 
[02:11:30]  I've been out of high school now since 1982.  No one's accusing you of being a Mensa member anyway.  What are you talking about?  No, because I'm accusing me.  Profoundly retarded.  No, I was closer to some of the questions, right, that you were asking us.  You guys.  And I...  Yeah, you guys.  You guys.  Okay.  You guys.  Okay.  Do you know why you don't remember things, too?  Because you're also an idiot.  Some of the stuff I would remember, but some of the stuff I wouldn't remember.  I think you would have passed the test.  Mary, would you remember the astronaut, the first astronaut that landed on the moon? 
[02:12:00]  Probably.  Okay.  Well, that I did not remember.  I couldn't...  All right.  Hold on.  Lady Di, but then we let you off the hook.  We said, okay, just name one astronaut.  You couldn't name an astronaut.  You don't know who Buzz Aldrin is?  Ah, see?  Don Glenn.  There's an astronaut.  Yeah, but you couldn't think of...  No, it was Buzz Aldrin.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  It was Michael Collins.  There was a lot of them.  Hold on.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Steve Dahl, you'll learn real fast.  We're a schizo radio show.  Lily.  Hi.  Hi, Lily. 
[02:12:30]  You have to go back.  Hi, guys.  You're contestant number 25 in the WOW Contest?  Yeah.  From Philly?  Yeah.  I didn't think you girls were listening to the show today.  Well, see, there's a whole story behind those pictures.  All right.  Mikayla and I, the other...  I think she's 24.  Yeah.  Can I say a picture?  Her and I, we went down to Philly, and we had huge, like, super soaker water guns,  and we were going to do, like, a double, like, thing, like, together,  and we didn't know that we could only do, like, one at a time.  Oh, really? 
[02:13:00]  And the reason I have that black stuff under my eyes is she came down as a police officer,  and I was in camo gear, and they're, like, stripped.  So we stripped.  Oh.  So that's why.  So I'm not a skank.  I thought you was very sexy.  Let me tell you, I thought you were really hot.  Thanks.  Opie?  Do you guys, uh, do you know Club Risque?  No.  It's in Bristol.  That's where we dance.  Oh, you dance to you.  Bristol, right next to your jeans.  You know, I don't think you're that bad after all.  Oh, yes, you do.  No, he doesn't.  No, no, I really don't. 
[02:13:30]  You're just saying that.  You know, I wanted to pull a train on you.  Ooh.  Hey, Lily.  Really?  No, yesterday, you know, I committed to one of the girls, and, uh, you know, I didn't  back off.  I'm telling you, I'm backing off.  I think you're all right.  Thank you very much.  I listen to your show, like, every day.  My boyfriend is obsessed with your show.  Cool.  I was mistaken.  Your boyfriend's very lucky.  I think she's very hot.  I thought there was a little sag to your boobs, but, uh...  What?  Yeah, I...  You know what's scary about that?  I'm only 19, and my boobs sag.  Oh, boy. 
[02:14:00]  All of a sudden, you are the best contestant.  Let me ask you something.  Do you feel like you have a little sag?  Yeah, I do.  See, I was wrong.  But you want to know what that's from?  What?  It's because I don't wear a bra, ever.  There you go.  See, you've got to wear a bra.  So, like, the bra keeps it up, and not wearing the bra, it starts to sag.  But don't worry, a couple years, I'll get the boobs done, so it's all right.  How long have you been dancing?  About six months, actually.  I'm fresh.  That's it?  What made you make the turn?  Actually, my friend Michaela.  Her and I danced together, so... 
[02:14:30]  And what happened?  What was your first night like?  Oh, it was crazy.  Were you nervous?  I was terrible, actually.  If you guys had been in there, I definitely would have gotten booed off the stage.  No.  Why?  Because you didn't know what you were doing?  No, I had no idea what to do.  It's even hotter.  All I knew was that I had to kick off my clothes.  Yeah.  Tear running down her cheek that this is what it's come to at 19.  It turned out like this.  Oh, my God.  I'm only 19, and I'm stripping.  It's so weird having all those people as opposed to just one uncle. 
[02:15:00]  Are you, like, really a sexual person?  Were you a little bit of a prude?  Have you been nude in front of guys before?  Not very many guys.  I was...  What the crazy thing is, the way you audition is you audition in front of anyone who's at  the bar, and I went on a night where it was very, very crowded.  Oh.  And so I was up there, and I was just like, uh, all right.  What was your special move?  My special move is, uh, I turn around, and I have my back to the bar, and I go down, 
[02:15:30]  and I start to, like, move my body in a way, like...  What do you mean?  You go to touch your toes?  Huh?  You go to touch your toes?  No.  With your ass face in the audience?  No?  No.  That's a good move, with the ass slap.  Well, my son is about to die.  This one, the car is going to die, so thanks, guys.  Steve knows that one.  Like, they bend over and get that whack on their ass.  It turns me on like that.  Well, thanks, guys, for everything.  I hate the ass slap.  You like that?  I think that's so phony.  Lily.  Yes.  You look great, Lily.  Thank you very much, guys. 
[02:16:00]  Lily.  Lily.  Grandpa.  Lily's going to be in the contest, Lily.  Grandpa.  Have a good day.  Now, Lily, what if Eddie sees these pictures?  Oh, oh, oh.  Look at her boobs.  19 seconds.  Oh, oh, oh.  Grandpa, could you give her some elixir to make her boobs firmer?  All right, Lily.  There she goes.  She knows when to punch out.  I see nothing wrong with her.  I think that's kind of, you know, hot.  I like the skanky shot where she's, if I'm using the word skanky, Opie, where she's just 
[02:16:30]  laying down on that.  Isn't that inviting?  It's kind of like, hey, come on over here, and the rest of that thong comes down kind of  thing.  Yes.  Yeah.  She's all right.  She won't be a finalist, but she's all right.  You're tough, man.  Yeah.  He is really, like, nasty and tough with these girls.  Lady Di and Marion.  What are you looking for?  On hold.  Why don't we take a break, and we'll give Lady Di the news next.  It seems like every pool in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable. 
[02:17:00]  Opie and Anthony.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  Opie and Anthony show, 1027, WNEW.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:17:30]  Sitting in today, Steve Dahl.  Hey.  I keep saying a radio legend, but he's still doing it, man.  When you say baseball legend, you're thinking Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, guys that aren't playing  anymore.  Steve Dahl still plays.  Still cranking them out.  I got the five-hour shift, though, not the four-hour.  See, we got the easy deal.  Oh, man.  Four hours is a piece of cake.  Cakewalk. 
[02:18:00]  We do the fake.  I was going to say fake bits.  Oh, my God.  We don't do fake bits.  You do the fake bits?  No, I was going to say that we play a lot of old bits.  We come up with excuses why we need to replay something, and then we look at the clock.  Hey, that's another 20 minutes we don't have to do.  Fake, I told you, dude.  Wow.  Fake.  You go two to seven?  Yeah, two to seven.  In Chicago, WCKG.  Yeah.  All right.  And then we follow him in Chicago.  I know.  All right, we got Wheelchair Fred on the line.  And then we got Lady Di, we got Marion, and a guy that wants to praise Steve Dahl. 
[02:18:30]  Uh-oh.  Let's go to Rick.  Hey, Rick, what's up?  It didn't turn out well last time.  What's up, right?  I hear you guys.  Bastards.  You guys are great.  Hey, man.  Look, I just want to let everybody know after I grew up with Steve Dahl when I lived in Chicago.  Yeah.  He's the man that ruined disco.  Thank God.  Steve Dahl got rid of disco.  Yeah?  Yes, he did.  He burned the records.  I mean, I was probably 13, 14 at the time.  And Ozzy was coming out, and he made him strong, and I'm glad he did. 
[02:19:00]  That's right.  Got to respect that.  Disco demolition.  You ever hear the disco story?  No.  Oh, it's great.  They had to cancel a Major League Baseball game because of him.  You know what?  I did hear something about that.  What was that?  I remember hearing guests.  Well, Steve.  July 12, 1979, in between the doubleheader, Tigers at White Sox, disco demolition.  You get in, the station was FM 98, so 98 cents and a disco record.  You get into the game.  We blow them up in between the games. 
[02:19:30]  A riot ensued.  Second game canceled.  A riot night?  Huge fire on the field.  Fire, looting, raping, pillaging, pondering.  Beautiful.  And you were sitting in one of the skyboxes or whatever, thinking, oh, man, this is just  going to suck, right?  Well, when I got there, because it was a doubleheader, I got there like at 3 in the afternoon,  and I'm wearing this stupid Army helmet, you know, and like, you know.  It was a different time, Steve.  Yeah, camouflage with the fishing lures on it, you know.  And you guys collected all the disco records. 
[02:20:00]  Put them in a box and blew them up.  With what?  The White Sox had like some kind of a demolition guy from Vietnam.  And he really blew them up, too.  But there was nobody there until the end of the first game.  So for three hours, I'm sitting there going, oh, man, I'm going to look like such a jerk  in this helmet with 2,000 people out there.  In this helmet.  He almost broke the place down.  Great.  And they went up hundreds, what, thousands of records, right?  Yeah, I mean, I, you know, yeah.  I mean, there were 45,000 people in there, so probably at least 45,000. 
[02:20:30]  And that stuff can burn.  There was another 40 outside trying to get in.  Wow.  Riot insist.  We never incited a riot.  Damn it.  What did they put them in when they blew them up?  Just a big box.  Loaded up with explosives.  No, I mean, really loaded up, too.  Like, way too much.  So what happened after they exploded?  And there was a fire on the field?  And people just kind of ran out.  Didn't have enough security, I guess. 
[02:21:00]  Just ran out and started running the bases and climbing up the batting cage.  Oh, man.  Boy, you can't get away with that these days.  No, you can't.  You can't really bring that much explosives into a ballpark these days, you know?  No.  That's classic.  All right, Tammy wants in.  Tammy.  Yes.  What's up?  Hi.  Oh, my God.  What's up?  Hi.  I like your show a lot.  Okay.  Thank you.  I just wanted to know what Anthony thought of his body on Foundry. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, foundrymusic.com.  Oh, you're Tammy.  Oh.  Uh-huh.  Let me see.  Let me look.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me go.  Hey.  Hi.  How are you doing?  Contestant number 32.  You got some wacky hair there, Tammy.  Hey, yeah.  That's what the photographer wanted.  Do you have one eye?  No, I have two eyes.  He wanted to hide them.  No, it's what?  He said it was too hot.  See?  Wow. 
[02:22:00]  That guy should be a politician.  What's wrong with her?  I think she's cute.  Let me see, Tammy.  All right.  Jim Norton thinks you're, um...  Jim, well, why don't you tell her, Jim?  Look.  I'd definitely bang you.  See?  Well, thank God for that, huh?  What's wrong, Opie?  Were you a member of the Manson family?  No.  Are you saying she looks like Squeaky Fromm?  Yeah.  She does not.  In between awful photo shoots, did you try to kill Gerald Ford? 
[02:22:30]  Well, unlike all your other Sacramento contestants, I know I listen to your show.  I think she's very cute.  Let me see again, Anthony.  I think any girl...  You could see her singing with Evolution, the Journey cover band.  I think any woman who's willing to take her top off, you know, there has to be some good there.  Right.  See?  That's what I'm saying.  You guys are a bunch of pussies.  I think, Tammy...  Or we're not getting any.  Tammy.  Uh-huh.  Hi.  I think your pictures are beautiful.  Get to the other one. 
[02:23:00]  No, that's her.  Oh.  Look at this one.  Tammy, would you admit that you have some problems?  What?  Yeah.  Every woman does.  What's your biggest problem?  Let's see if we're on the same page here.  Why are you hiding behind that hair?  I don't get that.  Yeah, I don't get that whole thing.  Duh.  I would say my belly's my biggest problem, because I have two kids.  You have two kids?  I have two kids.  How old a gal are you?  How old am I?  Yes.  Yeah.  25.  Your belly looks fine.  Yeah. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, that belly is all right.  Did they breastfeed?  No, they didn't.  Ah, see?  That saved your boobs.  I would have starved to death.  I'm sorry.  Now it's rubbing off on me.  Damn it.  Got milk?  No.  I don't know.  Tammy, I think you're very cute.  Me too.  Well, thank you so much.  I always wondered what one of Hamburglar's side chicks would look like naked. 
[02:24:00]  Tammy, that was Jim Norton, and I apologize for him.  That's okay.  I understand, Norton.  Can I see Tammy's picture again?  All right.  Let me spin that around for you.  Yeah.  I like it when they still have the pants on.  I think that's very sexy.  You like when the pants are on?  Yeah, Tammy.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  Yeah, there we go.  See?  Yeah.  Yeah, okay.  See, a lot of the girls are calling up because they say that they're being bashed on the show, 
[02:24:30]  but you haven't been bashed.  Not at all.  I haven't, um, no, I haven't thought that, no.  No.  I just wanted to know what you thought.  Not much.  And get to talk to you guys.  So you guys keep rocking, okay?  Hey, don't go away, man.  Now you're upset.  Don't be upset.  I'm not upset.  Oh, you should be.  Don't go away, man.  Just go.  I'm not.  I think that's a very cute shot, the first one.  She's got the hair in front of her face.  She's kind of like holding her legs. 
[02:25:00]  Why did they cover the Pejoria kid face?  I don't understand why that was covered.  Oh, Jimmy.  Would you stop?  Now I know what Marilyn Manson looks like without makeup.  But, you know, no, but obviously that's a joke for the radio.  I mean, everyone can see for themselves that you're a woman.  Very cute.  How old are your kids?  Um, four and three.  Four and three. 
[02:25:30]  Let me see.  Turn around.  All right.  Let me pop this one up for you.  A boy and a girl or?  Two girls.  Two girls.  There you go.  Yeah.  Do they have the same face as you?  No.  They're beautiful.  Well, you're very true.  I don't understand what Opie's saying.  I think she has a certain Ava Brown quality.  Yeah, right?  Yes, absolutely.  I was going to go with flawless German, and then it sounded weird. 
[02:26:00]  So I went back to Brown.  That's okay, man.  Ava Brown?  Who the hell is that?  Eric wants to talk to Anthony for some reason.  Yes, Eric?  Anthony, you're the biggest pussy alive.  What?  Why don't you be honest for what?  I'm sick of Opie having to be bad comp.  Grow a backbone, you faggot.  Where did...  All right, I'll tell...  Oh, she hung up.  Where did our contestant go?  She hung up, Eric.  You don't find her attractive? 
[02:26:30]  Well, I don't know why she would hang up.  All right, all right.  Maybe it's your call.  Maybe.  Maybe it was my call.  Stop ruining the show, Eric.  I'm sorry, guys.  I hope she doesn't drop out of the contest.  She's a winner.  I'm a bunch of smart asses, man.  Okay.  Try to have a little good...  Well, I want to...  I want to thank her for calling in today.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right, Marion.  Yeah, we're still here.  Lady Di.  Yes, I'm still here, too.  All right.  How are you doing, Diane?  Okay.  You're all right? 
[02:27:00]  These two are hot.  You're behaving?  Yes, I am.  I'm fine.  Okay, you sound okay.  Let's just put it this way.  I'd rather see Marion naked.  What?  Wow.  No.  No.  No.  Yes.  Yes.  That may be as a freak show.  Of course.  Okay.  Now, what's going on?  Well, Lady Di has tried her best to stay with the program.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  We give her an A for effort.  An A for effort?  Go ahead.  An A for effort. 
[02:27:30]  Marion.  Yes.  Well, Lady Di's been freaking since Friday, huh?  I haven't talked to her all weekend because, uh...  I haven't said anything.  Oh, Biancy, I'm going to tell you something.  Yeah.  What I said on the radio, what I said about Friday is true.  And let me tell you, she didn't talk to me all weekend.  I was out.  She took her phone off the hook.  She didn't really bother with nobody.  Marion pointed out Lady Di's drinking problem.  Yeah, well, you know what?  You know what it is?  She's going to go and straighten herself out.  Good.  She has to.  Is she going to go into rehab?  No. 
[02:28:00]  No.  She has...  Well, you know...  I can just...  I'm going to tell you something right now.  Believe me.  She's got problems.  A lot of people do.  I do, too.  But the thing is, she's got to just cool out with a lot of stuff, and she's going to  try to straighten out.  All right, Anthony...  Well, there you go.  Anthony, why don't you explain what's going on here with Lady Di?  Well, Lady Di and Marion came to this program as a team, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  Right.  And, uh...  The nutty Laverne and Shirley.  We noticed that...  There you go.  Thank you, Marion.  Would you just shut up, the two of you, for a second?  I love you guys, and you know that. 
[02:28:30]  We do.  We noticed...  After a while...  Hold on.  You know, schizo radio?  Yeah.  Uh, Hurls from Philly.  What has five legs and seven teeth?  What?  Three girls from Sacramento.  Three girls from Sacramento?  Shut up!  How many...  How many...  How many people went to the contest already?  She repeats everything.  She repeats everything.  Diane, why don't you enter?  Just shut up for a second.  Well, I have news for you.  There's a picture up on...  Never mind.  Forget it.  Are you enter?  Who took a picture of you?  They'll just keep talking, so I'll keep them down here. 
[02:29:00]  Go ahead, Anne.  So, the retarded Laverne and Shirley.  We noticed in time that Marion was a little more entertaining than Lady Di.  Actually, a lot more.  Marion would have her catchphrases.  She's funny.  She's got some...  She's got gumption.  Pizazz.  Pizazz.  She'll come back at you when you say something.  She's got her comebacks.  I try.  We just noticed Marion a little more entertaining, a little more willing to work with the show  and be fun and part of the show. 
[02:29:30]  So, Lady Di, on the other hand, baggage, dead weight, riding Marion's coattails.  Sure, they've known each other since junior high or high school.  I don't even know.  For years and years.  But I really see a rift in this friendship.  I see Marion continuing working with the show.  I don't see a rift in the friendship.  No, no.  We're all right with that as long as we get direct together.  Shut up.  Shut up.  Oh, shut up.  Anthony, explain how we gave Lady Di a chance, you know.  We did.  We saw this was happening and we said, look, Lady Di, you have a week and a half to come 
[02:30:00]  up with something entertaining, something you feel the listeners are now going to embrace  and say, okay, she's been dead weight, but now after this, I understand how she can then  become part of the show.  She's contributing to the show.  Something.  She's not tough.  You've got to be tougher.  She came up with nothing.  That's true.  I have to be a little tougher about this.  We finally put it to a vote with the listeners and said, okay, it's not even up to us anymore.  We'll leave it in the listeners' hands.  If they feel she is contributing enough to this show to stay part of the program, the 
[02:30:30]  listeners will say so.  Or they will say she is not and we have to get rid of her.  Make room for people like Wheelchair Fred and Tippi Tom and the new collection of freaks  we have coming in.  Tippi Tom.  Hey, I'm in with Tippi Tom.  Make room for Tippi Tom.  I'm in with Tippi Tom.  He sounds funny.  Do either of you own a gun?  Tippi Tom.  Please, please say Lady Di owns a gun.  No, she doesn't.  Neither do I.  I don't own a gun.  Paint your big toenail real nice red.  Shove it in that trigger hole.  I don't have a big toenail.  Although I will say your photo in Ted Nugent's book, you look good. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  Now, which one was I in Ted Nugent's book, Jeff?  Oh, shut up.  It's a joke.  It's wonderful.  He was making a water buffalo joke.  Not a water buffalo.  I was thinking more of the wild Russian boar.  Four.  As a matter of fact, I lost weight.  Four.  Perfect name for Lady Di.  Stop it.  You didn't lose anything.  She went to the doctor today.  All right.  Yes, I did.  I lost weight.  How much weight did you lose?  I lost 10 pounds.  Bold. 
[02:31:30]  I kid you not.  How bad?  150 to go.  Yeah, 150 to go.  Thank you.  At least I lost 10 pounds.  I just came from the doctor today.  So did I.  All right, listen.  So, Anthony, what's the verdict?  The verdict is, I'm looking at the votes here, 23.8%.  No, 24 I checked.  Shut up.  I got it right in front of me.  They probably rounded off to the next highest number, stupid.  23.  It was 24 the last time I checked. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, my God.  I just want to kill her so bad.  I wish.  Okay, go ahead.  Go ahead.  I'll let you go.  I wish they would just let me murder one person.  Lady Di, you're embarrassing us in front of Steve Dahl.  I'm sorry.  How you doing, Steve?  I didn't mean to do that.  She doesn't shut up.  She will not shut up.  She's incapable.  I am.  Be quiet because we'll hang up on you and you won't know.  All right.  I'll keep quiet.  Go ahead.  23.8% said, yeah, let her stay.  Now, all those votes, I could see them clicking away going,  but I voted to have her stay. 
[02:32:30]  You know, people think she's funny.  No, they don't.  They voted as a joke.  The important thing, 76.2% voted.  I don't think most people voted as a joke.  It's a blowout.  And you're being blown out.  Uh-oh.  Lady Di?  What do I do now?  Obviously nothing.  You're done with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh, my God.  Okay, I have no problem with that.  Lady Di, not just a name, a great suggestion. 
[02:33:00]  Hey, guys.  Can I ask you the question?  Yes.  Will I come up and visit in a couple weeks?  Can she come up with me?  Um, no.  No, we got to cut all the strings.  The Patty, the same thing with Patty.  She will not be welcome.  I hang with Patty, though.  I hang with her.  She will not be welcome.  Nope.  Oh, come on, guys.  Lady Di is out.  If she straightens out, if she straightens out, will she be able to go back on the show?  No.  What's she going to turn into?  She's not going to be funnier when she straightens out.  Yeah, right.  People are drunk.  Tim, Tim, I want to let you know something. 
[02:33:30]  She could be more like me, but she's nervous and she's worried about what other people think.  What does she got to eat and others?  I'm not worried about what anybody thinks.  It doesn't matter right now.  If they don't want me on the show, that's fine.  Yes, this is going to be uncomfortable for everyone.  No, it's not my show.  It's their show.  Shut up.  I know it is.  I'm only asking if you can come to my own business.  Oh, my God.  Shut up.  Okay.  Okay.  God.  John has a great idea.  Garing party.  If Lady Di can survive a night on Nugent's Ranch, she can stay.  What is a dudish ranch? 
[02:34:00]  What's that?  Oh, my God.  You are the dumbest individual.  It's Nugent's Ranch.  You don't listen.  I don't know what that is.  You don't listen and you're stupid.  Nugent's Ranch, they said.  Anthony, this is going to be very uncomfortable for everyone.  Dudish.  Lady Di is out, and I want to introduce everyone to her replacement.  Here he is.  This should make for some good radio.  Wheelchair Fred.  Let me say something.  Lady Di, bye.  It's a replacement.  It's good to be the king.  Hey, what about Tippy Tom? 
[02:34:30]  We play some with Tippy Tom.  Wheelchair Fred.  You don't want Tippy Tom.  Wheelchair Fred.  Yeah, I'm here.  You are now an official member of this program.  You have taken the spot of Lady Di.  Wheelchair Fred is confined to a wheelchair.  He had a bad motorcycle accident many years ago.  He still has his mind, but his legs were battered, so he has to be in a wheelchair.  And his voice was so screwed up, he sounds profoundly retarded, but he really isn't.  Are you going to do what?  Are you coming from Boston to be with you guys?  Shut up. 
[02:35:00]  And like Marion, he already has a catchphrase.  Yes.  Marion's catchphrase, let's do it.  Wheelchair Fred's catchphrase is, I'm not gay, I'm just desperate.  I'm not gay.  I'm just gay.  I'm not gay.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  Oh, my God, listen to this.  It sounds like a goddamn institution.  Don't plug your kid for me.  Just let him talk.  All right, hold on.  Marion, shut your trap, okay?  Okay.  I know that big tongue gets in the way, but just shut up for a second. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, man.  All right, Wheelchair Fred.  Yeah.  Why don't you talk to Lady Di?  Lady Di.  Yes.  Talk to him, Diane.  I just said, bye, Di.  It's good to be the king.  I heard you on the tape.  I have the Demented World tape, and I heard you.  Wheelchair Fred.  Yeah.  What do you plan on doing for the program to contribute to this show?  I don't know. 
[02:36:00]  Will you be having more man-on-man sex because you're desperate?  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Hey, Diane, why don't you hook up with him?  That's man-on-man.  Oh, please, Marion.  Please don't fight at six feet.  I don't know.  That's man-on-man.  That's crazy.  Please don't do that.  For the show.  You can get fixed up.  Lady Di's getting replaced by a guy that has man-on-man sex from his wheelchair.  But he's not gay.  He's just desperate because the girls run away from him.  What are you doing?  He just needs some skin-to-skin.  Yes.  How about if we get Diane fixed up with him? 
[02:36:30]  Okay.  No, no.  Lady Di is done with the show.  Lady Di's done.  When we hang up, that's it.  I'm done.  I'm done with the show.  That's it.  I am finished.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  I'm done.  Wheelchair Fred.  That's their decision.  Wheelchair Fred.  Yeah.  We know.  Oh, God, shut up.  We know you've had man-on-man sex because you can't get women.  But you're not gay.  You just needed some, like, action.  Yeah.  But I'm desperate.  Yeah.  He's not gay.  He's desperate.  There's his catchphrase.  We love it.  We love a catchphrase. 
[02:37:00]  Lady Di had...  I'm desperate.  I'm single.  Lady Di had over two years to come up with a catchphrase.  Couldn't do it.  I had over two years to come up with a catchphrase.  Wheelchair Fred, after one appearance on our show, Anthony came up with a catchphrase.  Yeah.  I'm not gay, I'm desperate.  Where does that come from?  What?  Lady Di...  Two years to come up with a catchphrase.  Yeah, what?  You said yin-yang party, don't you?  Well, yin-yang party, what's our catchphrase?  No, that was a team catchphrase between the two of you.  It doesn't count.  I said, let's do it.  I even had a T-shirt made. 
[02:37:30]  Right.  Marion had a T-shirt made.  She's got a catchphrase.  It's let's do it.  Well, I've known open FB verse five or six years now.  I know you did.  I know you've known him for a long time.  Let's hear Marion's catchphrase.  Here it is.  Let's do it!  Oh, she did it at the same time.  Let's do my catchphrase.  Zero.  That's a great catchphrase.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  I'll say.  Hey, wheelchair Fred, let's hear your catchphrase.  I'm not gay, I'm desperate.  All right, isolate that. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, man.  And Lady Di, your catchphrase?  My only catchphrase is, how are ya?  Oh, God, that stinks.  That stinks.  Wasn't that Ralph Malfe's catchphrase?  How are ya?  How are ya?  How are ya?  You're saying, how you doing?  Do you still got it?  How you doing?  All right, Lady Di, you're done.  Okay, I'm done with the show.  Lady Di, I have a catchphrase for you.  What's that?  Do my role.  Tomorrow? 
[02:38:30]  Do my role.  Do my role?  You're a role?  Do my role.  Yeah, you're a very large lady.  You're gonna meet him, Diane?  What's your role?  Wait, wait, wait.  What's his...  What's your role?  I heard you're a very large lady.  I'm very what?  Large lady.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, she's a large lady.  The chair is a role of blubber.  Yeah, she's got roles of blubber, Fred.  Do my role. 
[02:39:00]  But, you know, I am a large lady, yeah.  I think Fred wants to do one of your roles.  He wants to F your role.  I want...  You want to F my role?  Yes.  Oh, God.  I would not think.  All right.  And he would roll up to do that, right?  Yeah, he would roll up and then F the role.  What?  Why do I go out?  Lady Di, you're...  Wait, you want to go out?  Lady Di...  Where do you live?  All right.  All right.  Okay, quiet.  Okay, quiet.  Oh, my God.  I can count the chromosomes on one hand. 
[02:39:30]  Whose chromosome?  Oh, God.  And she's always got a...  Whose chromosome?  Wheelchair friends on the phone?  I'm a chromosome, baby.  Lady Di.  Yes.  It's a lifetime ban from the O.P. and Anthony show.  Oh.  But kind of like P. Rose, you can apply for reinstatement, I guess.  That's a very long time.  You know what, guys?  You would miss her.  Uh, no.  No.  You guys would.  You're wrong.  You would miss her.  You didn't miss me.  It's kind of drastic there.  I know you guys.  So good.  You should miss her. 
[02:40:00]  Tell her off, Fred.  She's done.  Let her know it.  But you know what...  Hey, bitch.  You know what?  I will tell you the truth.  Bye, bitch.  I still love you guys no matter what.  I still listen to you.  I'll stop with the teary-eyed crap.  No one cares.  I'm telling you right now.  She's going to still go to road shows.  And events that you guys...  You know something?  I love you, baby.  If she wants to pay, but she will not be backstage or anything.  Diane, it's going to love you.  I don't care. 
[02:40:30]  She's like a lady.  Hey, Diane, he's saying he loves you.  Oh, but if he's too much, it's one.  He sounds like he's saying he loves you.  All right, listen.  Oh, wheelchair, Fred.  Lady Di, any final thoughts, final words?  Well, the final thoughts is I still love you guys, and I still listen to you guys, and  there's no hard feelings.  If you don't think I'm great enough to be on your show, that's fine.  You could apply for reinstatement.  That's what they do with lifetime bands.  You could apply for reinstatement.  Fred breathing.  You can't apply for reinstatement for at least 90 days, though. 
[02:41:00]  Okay.  So someone will figure out the 90-day mark, and then you can maybe try to get reinstated,  okay?  Hey, guys, when can I come up and visit?  Marion, in a surprising move, you are also banned from the show.  What?  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  Because you're a team.  We're getting rid of the team.  I'm not banned.  You're banned.  You know why?  Come on, guys.  You know why?  Hey, Diane, it doesn't bother me.  You know why?  Because let me tell you one thing. 
[02:41:30]  When people miss...  Uh-oh, here we go.  When people email and say they're going to miss us, we'll see what happens.  Teams, when they break up, you know, when the one guy goes on, it's never the same.  But, hey, guys, you know...  So we're going to have to ban both of you.  Do you know what happened, though?  Last Friday, two Fridays ago, everybody likes...  Lady Di got drunk and fell down?  No.  No, I did not get drunk and fell down.  No, Diane was behaved.  You know that.  People love us.  Anthony, are you in agreement?  Sure. 
[02:42:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're going to have to go back.  You guys will miss us.  Marion, you are banned from the show as well.  Yeah.  I'm banning everybody.  Hey, Diane, you know what?  That's okay.  It doesn't bother me.  Well, now you want to talk to her, but how come when you were saying that she was a drunk  and all that stuff...  Because, Jim Norton, let me tell you something.  She has...  Oh, God.  You are back for a couple of years.  Thursday night, she called me up fighting with me for no reason, okay?  Yeah.  He said...  Wait a minute, Diane.  Let me finish.  She said things to me that she shouldn't have said. 
[02:42:30]  What'd she say?  I'm not going to get into it.  Well, you can get into it a little bit.  It's important.  No, no, no.  No.  No, it's not necessary.  Not when it's got to do with another party involved.  Well, just say it without saying the party's name.  No.  No.  And we talked yesterday, and when she straightens out...  All right, Marion.  You know...  Marion.  What?  We're just kidding.  You're still with the show.  I know that.  All right.  I love you guys, anyway.  You know that.  You love me.  I think you're going to have a fine career without Lady Di.  Oh, she loves you.  She loves you. 
[02:43:00]  Oh, wait a minute.  I don't know Pete Anthony and Jim Norton.  I don't know you.  I can't say I love you.  Freddie.  Freddie is saying you're...  Freddie, what are you saying?  Lady Di?  Oh, she loves you guys.  She loves you.  Hey, Lady Di?  I love you guys.  Shut up.  Lady Di.  That's it.  Your final words.  My final words is I love you guys.  I'm not going to stop listening to you.  Bye-bye.  There it is.  Bye, big...  Joe.  What did she say?  Bye, big...  Joe. 
[02:43:30]  Big toe?  What's wrong with your big toe?  Bye, big...  Joe.  Sounds like you're saying a big toe.  What's he saying?  I don't know.  Bye, big...  Joe.  Bye, big...  Joe?  Yeah.  You're saying...  You're saying...  You're saying a big deal, though.  Yeah, but I'm not allowed to take you, Joe.  Hey, Diane.  Yes.  Can you listen to us?  No, Diane's gone.  She's dead.  Are you hung up on her?  And that's it for her.  That is it.  Lady Di is dead to us.  Are you for real, guys? 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yep.  Can she come up a visit when I come up there?  Nope.  No, no.  No?  Nope.  Leave her outside in the courtyard or in the lobby.  Okay.  Gone.  She can still go to see you there.  Leave her once she can speak.  Yes, Fred.  What?  Leave her on 42nd Street.  What is she saying?  Leave her on 42nd Street.  Yeah.  I feel my IQ falling.  It's plummeting listening to these two talks.  Where is this guy from?  Don't worry about it, Mary. 
[02:44:30]  It don't matter to you.  You don't need to know.  You wouldn't tell us what you were talking about before.  Wheelchair Fred?  No, it's something private.  Wheelchair Fred?  Yeah, what's that?  Welcome back to the Opinion Air Show.  Welcome to the show.  The Opinion Air Show is good to be back.  All right.  It's good to be back.  And it's good to be the king.  All right, Fred.  Why don't you leave it with your catchphrase?  I'm gay.  This will you all be.  I'm not gay. 
[02:45:00]  I'm desperate.  I'm just desperate, you idiot.  Get your catchphrase straight.  Write your catchphrase down, all right?  I love the very important story.  I don't know what he's saying.  You have to rise to you, but what's that story?  All right, Fred.  And, uh, Mary, your catchphrase?  Let's do it.  Uh, put some balls into it.  Let's do it.  Listen to the way it sounds here.  Let's do it.  Let's do it.  She's kind of bummed because she lost a friend here. 
[02:45:30]  Look how happy that she's back on the show.  You know what it is?  It's like the live version.  When you see the live version of a band and it's not quite as good as the recording.  Yeah, I'll play it for you.  I'll play it for you.  Shut up for a second, you goddamn...  Listen, listen.  Here it is.  Record it.  And then you do it exactly the same way.  Okay, listen.  Sure.  Let's do it!  Let's do it!  Let's do it!  Let's do it now.  Fred, that's not your catchphrase, though.  Yes, it is.  No kidding, Sherlock. 
[02:46:00]  No kidding, Sherlock.  No kidding, Sherlock.  Okay, Fred, your catchphrase once again.  I'm not damned in this, Fred.  All right, there you go.  All right, you too.  Okay, I'm gonna go there.  Bye, fellas.  Bye, fella.  I'm kicking away and bye.  All right, bye.  Fred?  O.B. Anthony.  Yes.  I'll see you guys in a couple weeks, okay?  Congratulations.  Hey, you know, no hard feelings, but she'll be okay.  All right, she's got 90 days to... 
[02:46:30]  She's got problems that she's got to sort out of.  Kind of like P. Rose.  She could apply for reinstatement in like 90 days.  Don't worry about it.  You'll be all right.  But she is banned.  Really?  Seriously?  Yes.  Well, we'll still see you guys.  And you know what, Marion?  I gotta tell you.  I gotta leave you with this.  If you were a true friend, you would have walked today.  I'm not walking.  Of course not, because you're not a true friend with Lady Dot.  Oh, I am too, but I'm not walking this because she's not like me.  Hey, what are you gonna do?  But I'm not gonna, um... 
[02:47:00]  She's not sacrificing her little stardom.  You're basically a star...  I'm still gonna come up and visit.  You're a star on the rise, and you didn't want her pulling you down.  Just be honest.  No.  She could be a little more funny, or she wants to be.  She couldn't hold a candle to what you do on the show.  She could be a little tough, or if she wants to be.  She's your Andrew Ridgely.  She doesn't have that attitude, but she has...  She's your Art Garfunkel.  Oh.  To your Paul Simon.  Why don't you just admit that, that you're...  No, Jim, seriously, I know her for years, and she can speak with that type of attitude, 
[02:47:30]  but it's just that...  Oh, I can't listen to her anymore.  I can't listen to anyone.  All right, we gotta go.  She's driving me crazy.  Steve, thank you.  Steve Dahl.  Thank you, guys.  WCKG in Chicago.  Thank you, Steve.  We had a lot of fun.  Thank you so much.  Me too, thanks.  All right.  I guess we're out of here.  Yeah.  So there it is.  Lady Di is out.  Wheelchair Fred is in.  We gotta tell Tippi Tom he's in now.  Tippi Tom is in, too, yeah.  And who is he replacing?  I believe he replaced Patty.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  That was a given, so...  Just trying to make the radio show a little better. 
[02:48:00]  Just trying.  That was a good trade, though.  That was a nice trade.  Really good.  Fred, lose Lady Di, gain wheelchair Fred.  I know wheelchair Fred's gonna be a hit on this show, because Ben was losing his effing mind.  Yeah.  And half the time, Ben sits to the left of me here and just yawns, so...  When he starts talking about those stories.  But Ben enjoys wheelchair Fred, so I don't know what to do.  Holding on to the...  Holding on to the bedpost with his shaky arms, getting pulled by another man.  How do you not tune in for that?  All right. 
[02:48:30]  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  He got you.  No, he didn't.  He totally got you, man.  No, he didn't prove it.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't.  No, he didn't. </pre>
