<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a scathing critique of the Oscars ceremony. Opie, Anthony, and Jim Norton unleashed a barrage of vulgar and offensive comments targeting the presenters, including Billy Crystal (labeled a "professional douchebag"), and various aspects of the show.  Their criticism focused on performances, wardrobe choices (specifically criticizing Cameron Diaz, J-Lo, and Melissa McCarthyâ€™s dresses), and the celebrities' physical appearances (Angelina Jolie's thinness was a particular target).  They also speculated about Jonah Hill's sexuality and the relationships of other celebrities. Sasha Baron Cohen's ash-dumping stunt on Ryan Seacrest was deemed hilarious, and a clip of Chris Rock's Oscars stand-up routine mocking voice acting was played.  A listener, Mars, then called in to recount a graphic and explicit homosexual experience.  The segment ended with continued discussion of the Oscars and the hosts' opinions on various celebrities,  with Sean William Scott's upcoming appearance to promote *Goon* mentioned.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of Ben & Jerry's apology for their Jeremy Lin-inspired ice cream flavor containing fortune cookies.  The hosts and callers debated the offensiveness of this inclusion, delving into broader stereotypes about Asian people, including their work ethic and customer service in Asian-owned businesses.  Speculation on the authenticity of the outrage surrounding the ice cream followed.  Tangents included the hosts' ice cream preferences, a caller's experiences in China, and a lengthy, explicit discussion with Barbara, a Japanese-American woman, detailing the unusual sexual requests she received due to fetishization of Asian women.  The segment concluded with the hosts planning a shocking "glass coffee table day" stunt, a discussion of their lack of work despite high salaries, and a search for a new agent. Sean William Scott briefly appeared again at the end to promote *Goon*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wow.  And now, the moment you've all been patiently waiting for,  it's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:00:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:01:30]  Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:00]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:02:30]  Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:03:00]  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans. 
[00:03:30]  Here we go. Here's the bit.  At the controls, Greg Hughes, a father.  I would love to say we have the best job in America.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  It could be the best thing ever.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  Out loud laughs.  How do we explain the show?  We should start there.  Oh, here it is.  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony Show, a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment and having very few limits. 
[00:04:00]  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  This is a freak show.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  Under the right circumstances, something weird could happen.  I don't give a fuck.  Laugh out loud funny.  Which I love.  That's what I love.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  Because when you listen to our show, you know what you get.  You know what we are.  Everything has to do with cock or balls.  No, the jokes all end up talking about cock and balls.  You're a waste of life.  Fucking listeners, go fucking die. 
[00:04:30]  Excuse me.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people, real excitement.  Wow.  Get ready to experience the thrill of a lifetime.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Absolutely.  Good morning.  This is not a replay.  Good morning.  A lot of people thought we would not be here this morning.  Why?  Because we were live tweeting the Oscars for TweetRoast.com. 
[00:05:00]  There's a bunch of buddinskis and know-it-alls.  They're like, ah.  Boy, I guess there's no show tomorrow.  You're up at 1130.  Oh, yeah.  Look out.  Like, good luck getting up in the morning.  Yeah.  Shut up.  We're here.  Anthony's back from vacation.  Ah, yes.  Oscars and vacation stories today, right?  Oh, all well-rested.  And Fez is gay.  My God, man.  Yeah, I heard that show.  Wow.  I heard clips of that one. 
[00:05:30]  I just like Ronnie.  I think Fez was the last to know that he was gay.  I know.  I like the Ronnie part, though, where he was like, so what is this new character there, Fez?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Good for Fez.  Yeah.  Yeah, there you go.  Oh, my God.  I think you were the last to know.  How does that work?  You're not supposed to be the last to know.  Isn't that usually the case?  The gay guy is not supposed to be the last one to know.  When people come out, doesn't everybody around them usually go, oh, yeah, well, come on.  We all kind of know. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, but not listeners to a radio show that don't hang out with them personally.  Maybe, yeah.  Good for Fez.  Do we do vacation stories or do we do Oscars?  I don't know.  Let's start with Oscars.  Oscars.  Yeah.  Oscars.  Oscars.  Yeah, that was, you know, overall.  And I know it's just pretty normal to just say that it was a bore fest and everything like that, but it was a bore fest.  Well, I think it starts with Billy Crystal. 
[00:06:30]  I think I tweeted that Chris Rock did, what, two, three minutes?  Yeah, yeah.  And showed everyone what an Oscar host could be.  Right.  Which makes this boring fucking event exciting when you get an edgy host like that.  He has some energy, too, you know.  He's too honest.  He's too honest.  Chris wrecked their night when he did it because he's a comic just shitting on them.  Right.  No, they can't handle a guy like him just going up there and just fucking taking apart what they do.  Oh, it's terrible.  Well, so we all have to suffer? 
[00:07:00]  That's exactly it.  That was funny.  So we all have to suffer.  He just took apart that whole thing with voicing cartoons.  It's easy.  It's easy.  Right, right, right.  Here you go.  A million dollars.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They tell me the line and I say the line.  Yeah.  That's the clip we should play today, Sam, is to Chris Rock because that was great.  Chris Rock.  I think that was the only presenter that was great was Chris Rock.  And he came out with energy and everything like that.  Yeah.  And then you have, you know, oh, boy, Billy Crystal. 
[00:07:30]  He just comes out.  It was like trying to reprise glory moments from years gone by.  And it wasn't doing it.  He's a professional.  You know, you can't take that away from him.  Professional what?  Just a professional.  Professional.  Douchebag.  Dated.  Professional host.  Host.  Just professional, I don't know.  He's not going to completely bomb, but he's not going to make it that exciting either.  Completely.  But when he's got to say things like, they were hilarious, weren't they? 
[00:08:00]  If you have to say they were hilarious.  They're not hilarious.  Odds are they weren't hilarious.  That black and white bit, that tribute to the artist bit.  Yeah.  Wasn't particularly a great bit.  You don't like it?  No.  No, because they were all just, it was a little long.  What do you think was the biggest bomb bit of the night?  I have my answer.  Oh, oh, the biggest bomb bit of the night.  Like the biggest one where you're like, oof.  Oh, it had to be. 
[00:08:30]  The gals showing their asses.  That was bad.  The gals, Cameron Diaz.  J-Lo.  J-Lo.  That was terrible.  And was that a nipple or not?  Let's get that out of the way.  I don't know.  The J-Lo thing.  Was that a nipple?  I didn't notice it until I was on Twitter and people talked about it.  Sometimes they cover their areolas with a little sticker, so maybe that was part of  the sticker that was showing.  No, it had to be, oh my God, Emma Stone and fucking.  No, I kind of liked Emma Stone.  What?  I mean, just that, I don't know. 
[00:09:00]  The little banter back and forth.  Well, I liked that she was like, she was so excited because she was presented for the  first time.  Yeah.  I shouldn't say like, like I was excited about it, but I didn't mind it, I guess.  I was getting a little douchey on that one.  But Jimmy, what was the, uh, the Robert Downey Jr.  Oh yeah, of course.  Oh.  With making the documentary on presenting.  With Gwyneth Paltrow.  That, it got.  They were acting.  Dude, it got a one.  And it went on for an hour and 10 minutes.  It was horrendous. 
[00:09:30]  They couldn't, they couldn't bail from it.  Dude, actually.  What's the problem with that shit?  It's terrible.  They can't talk.  Yeah, you're just done.  Why can't they bail out of that shit and just look at each other and go, well, obviously  this isn't working and have fun with it.  Why can't, why can't these guys improvise when they're up there?  Yeah, talk about how it's sucked in rehearsal and it's not any better now.  And I get that they want to have it organized and here's your lines, here's my lines.  But why can't, as two actors, supposedly two entertainers, and I say supposedly, they can't  just improvise their way out of a bad situation? 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  I don't think that would be that difficult.  Jay Moore had a great one last night on the Twitter roast thing.  Yeah.  He said, oh my God, I want to remember exactly what he said.  Oh, this rehearsal is awful.  Because the whole thing was coming off like it was just an Oscar rehearsal.  Oh, yeah.  This rehearsal is awful.  Yeah.  Well, I mean, the big letdown was Billy Crystal as the fucking host.  Well, of course.  Because where we said, you want someone edgy, that's going to kind of beat these guys up 
[00:10:30]  a little bit and have some fun with it.  Billy Crystal just played all nice for everybody.  All nice and doing the same shit.  You want it?  But he did.  I mean, oh, look at the song and dance number about the movies.  Oh, was I just, ugh.  Why?  He's known for that.  I was watching.  But he's known for that.  Stop.  He's known for that.  Known for that.  Yeah.  So tonight, enjoy yourselves. 
[00:11:00]  Because nothing can take the sting of the world's economic problems like watching millionaires  present each other with golden statues.  He seemed like he was a little off in general, too, right?  With his timing and his jokes.  I wonder if he was a little bit nervous.  Don't forget he was a last minute.  I mean, I should say last minute.  He was a replacement at this point.  But I prefer when the host is meaner to the actors, but they don't want that.  No, they don't.  They're such fucking babies.  They can't handle a guy who really rose to them.  They just can't handle it. 
[00:11:30]  But who's in charge?  I mean, the audience suffers.  But then again, they get the audience no matter what, right?  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  A couple billion worldwide.  We're watching this thing.  Oh, they love that.  Because it's about seeing who wins.  They don't really care.  Like, you know, the other stuff's nice, but they just want to see who wins.  It's a wonderful night for Oscar, Oscar, Oscar, who will win.  You didn't think I wasn't going to do this, did you?  What is this, vaudeville?  Oh, you didn't think I was not going to do this, did you, David, my son David? 
[00:12:00]  You think everyone was sitting in the audience going, I hope he does the big song thing?  Here it comes.  God, I really hope.  I think people like it.  Oh.  You think he's going to do his Oscar song?  God, I hope so.  Yeah, you think they like it, Jim?  Yeah, I think people just got it.  God, I hope so.  It's his thing.  You know?  I think people just, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, it's his thing.  Yeah, it's like, what do you know?  Do you like the song, though, that he does?  Like, you know, he changes the words around.  I only heard, it was fine.  I mean, I only heard part of it.  I didn't hear all of it. 
[00:12:30]  I tell you, my personal opinion, he sucked the giant fat cock.  It was terrible.  Well.  That fucking song and dance, soft shoe shit he does.  But it's no worse than past Oscar performances by the guy.  The problem is, time has passed him by, I think. 
[00:13:00]  I guess it was.  When was the last time he did the Oscars?  A few years ago.  A few years.  He was much better than they were last year, though.  I mean, I liked having him as a host, opposed to fucking Franco and Hathaway.  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  Of course.  That was a big dud.  Oh.  Did you do this, did you?  We got a hustle.  By the way, some of the writing for the Oscars, I don't know who they hired to write.  And I mean, just for the other presenters.  For some of the presenters, some of the lines they had were just really bad. 
[00:13:30]  Like, the presenters were doing these weird lines.  And I'm trying to think of the example I can't think of, but I was like, some of the writing  I thought was really weak.  Yeah.  I'm sure they had a whole staff of guys.  Did you?  We got to hustle because the nine nominated films are...  He won't talk.  Don't ask him.  He won't talk.  Don't ask him.  But if the artist wins, he'll say, and ask you, ba-boo. 
[00:14:00]  All right, look.  Boo!  Yes!  What the fuck was that?  That's funny.  I'm funny.  He won't talk.  Don't ask him.  Well, it's a silent movie.  Yeah.  No, we get it.  Trust me, we get it.  And he's French, and then...  We'll handle this.  Oh.  We get it.  You know people.  Shut up.  Oh, God.  Get out of my way.  He needs to be beat up.  Go get a cup of coffee at Starbucks and join us later.  This guy's getting a beating. 
[00:14:30]  I like the Sammy.  Da, da, da.  I like the Sammy character there with the Justin Bieber.  Oh, yeah.  I'm glad he brought that back.  Yeah, Sammy Davis Jr. brought that back.  Yeah.  Bang, bang.  What year is it again?  I thought it was a nice touch having the Biebs.  The Biebs.  Biebs means instant ratings.  Well, that's what he was going for.  Oof.  His horses will horse because his horseman threw his Phil Berg in toward the horse.  And now the Oscars may endorse the famous Mr. Joey. 
[00:15:00]  I just got the biggest...  Be more funny.  This is going great.  He's doing bits and songs with the Mr. Ed song.  Can someone tell me how fucking old Mr. Ed is?  So, is it this great?  Holy shit. 
[00:15:30]  Hanks is a memory.  Hanks is a memory.  He's caught in a riddle.  Jonah used to have much more to his middle.  It's great that you shed weight.  But, kid, if you lose tonight, I think that you should know.  There's certain cupcakes after the show.  He already gained the weight back, though, Billy. 
[00:16:00]  Did he?  Jonah?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He's got the weight back.  What are these?  The top moments?  He's on his second fat already.  Oh, is he?  Yeah.  Are those the top Oscar moments, Sam?  He was good in the...  In Moneyball.  Yeah, Jonah was good.  It was all right.  Yeah.  I thought they really could have thrown just about anyone in there.  Yeah.  Well, that's sort of what I thought, too.  Yeah.  To be honest with you.  I wouldn't know.  We didn't get to talk to him for his Oscar movie.  He's coming in for 21 Jump Street, though.  All right.  Oh, really?  Yeah. 
[00:16:30]  21 Jump Street.  I'm fine with that one.  Is he going to play the Peter DeLuise part?  I don't know.  It's going to be a good movie.  Who's playing the Johnny Depp part?  I don't know.  Is Johnny Depp going to be like the head of the...  I don't know.  Do you think he's going to have a cameo?  Do you think he'll come back?  It's like...  I don't know.  I doubt it.  Why did Jonah Hill bring his mom to the Oscars?  Because I presume that he is gay.  Jonah?  I'm guessing.  Why the fuck wouldn't you use a pussy opportunity like the Oscars to get a date? 
[00:17:00]  That is like...  You can't lose with that one.  Hey, you want to go to the Academy Awards?  I'm nominated.  You are so getting your dick sucked.  Why doesn't he make believe like George Clooney?  Clooney?  Is that his wife?  No.  She's fucking phenomenal.  No.  That's WWE diva.  Yeah.  I forgot her name for a second.  Stacey Keebler.  Yeah, Stacey Keebler.  Yeah, she's a tall drink of water.  Stacey Keebler.  I don't know. 
[00:17:30]  I don't know if he is or not.  I thought that.  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I've heard rumors about Clooney, but I think the guy's straight.  He's always fucking with some pussy.  Well, then you look at the guys that aren't with the pussy and you're like, oh, they're  a little...  Some guys bring their mom.  Some guys bring a tall drink of water to kind of trick people.  I don't know.  That's a hell of a trick.  No kidding.  You could bring, you know...  Whoa. 
[00:18:00]  Yeah, she's known for her legs.  She's really sexy.  What was her big moment there, Sam, in WWE?  What was one of her big moments?  Was it when she pinned Bob Backlund for the title, the Intercontinental?  I don't know if she had any specific big moments, but she was very well known for wearing very  short shirts and...  And very short...  Just walking into the ring was her big deal.  What she did in the ring was not much of a...  Was she a wrestler?  She threw a leg every once in a while.  Yeah, she was technically a wrestler. 
[00:18:30]  She did some moves.  She wasn't really...  She was there for her legs.  Circa what year?  Are we looking at?  Five or six years ago now, right?  Yeah, early 2000s.  Very early 2000s, I would say.  Yeah.  The world's Gorsesio's Prince, and no one's in a splint.  Well, that's you, though.  There's no passing, no bomb, there's no killing, no mob.  It's just you, though.  But it's true, I prefer for the sequel you don't be so hardy. 
[00:19:00]  Advocate, cracker head, shoot Ben Kingsley in bed, push him, Marty.  Okay, okay, save it for the field.  It's time to rock.  That is fucking terrible.  Okay, okay.  Wow.  That's awful.  By the way, you guys are saying a lot about Jonah Hill.  He's engaged to Dustin Hoffman's daughter. 
[00:19:30]  Okay.  Yeah, why did he bring her to the Oscars?  Why did he bring his mom?  Maybe she's working.  Because, you know, oh, that's probably why.  Because they asked him, one of the people asked him about Dustin Hoffman on the carpet.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Let's go to Green Bay.  Bob.  Actually, it's Bob.  That's all right.  Over.  Okay.  How are you guys doing today?  Good, buddy.  So what's up?  He's marrying Dustin Hoffman's daughter?  Yeah, the only reason I was calling is that you guys just blew my call.  I know, I know, yeah. 
[00:20:00]  Let's take a little look.  All right, whatever.  Is that Dustin Hoffman's daughter?  Sure.  Damn.  See why I was trying to lose some weight.  Damn.  Let me see this.  Let's take a look at Dustin Hoffman.  Oh, well.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  God.  That blonde hair could trick you.  That tricks you from a distance.  It sure does.  She's cute, I mean.  You know, she's got a nice smile.  What are you going to do?  It's like a Chelsea Clinton smile.  A lot of teeth going on there.  That was exactly what happens with Twitter fucking, the little pictures on Twitter. 
[00:20:30]  You know, the thumbnails.  You look and you go, oh.  And then you click and there's three levels of Twitter pictures.  There's the initial little tiny thumbnail.  Right.  Then the one that gets a little bigger.  Right.  When you click on the person.  And then the one that gets real big when you click on the picture again.  And sometimes it's like, oh.  Sometimes you're pleasantly surprised.  And then you click on it and go, I can't really. 
[00:21:00]  And then the last one you're like, oh, wow.  That wasn't even anything like I expected.  You've got to get through the three stages, though.  Three stages of TwitPix.  Everyone's avatar looks good when it's a fucking postage stand.  Yeah.  You want to hear more of the song?  Oh, please.  All right.  All right.  What's it all about?  Malick.  The tree of life was deep and hard. 
[00:21:30]  Malick.  I heard it even freaked out.  God explained it.  Malick.  George is cracking up because his wife is cracking up.  George is cracking up because the wife is cracking up.  No, they want her close.  She's got a comatose.  So it makes it hard to tell her that you're mad.  The problem is it's hard to follow the words.  Thank God.  No, but that's where the comedy is. 
[00:22:00]  It's supposed to be, yeah.  I mean, if you're going for the comedy, you've got to be able to follow the words.  But he's trying to fit these fucking words into the song.  Shoehorning it.  And you've got to really focus to try to get the jokes.  Yeah.  I don't want to try that home when I'm watching the Oscars.  I fucking hate Billy Crystal.  I fucking hate him.  Why do I hate him, though?  He's terrible.  Has he ever been in a good movie?  Oh, Curly's Gold.  First one was all right, right?  City Slickers 2, Curly's Gold. 
[00:22:30]  What about the one with the orgasm in the diner?  Was he good in that one?  Harry Sully.  Was he good in it, though?  Could anyone have done the role?  Analyze this was good.  Analyze this.  All right.  Yeah, it was funny.  Throw mama from a train.  Very funny, that's it.  All right.  That movie was funny.  All right.  I don't know.  I love when Danny DeVito goes, it'll be ruined.  It'll be ruined.  He says ruined.  Ruined.  It'll be ruined.  Do you like the Billy Crystal?  Not a bit. 
[00:23:00]  I'm sorry.  Don't find him funny.  He's a fellow Long Islander.  We should support the Long Islanders.  When he was playing the, you know, when he was playing the Faggala.  Was he good in My Giant?  Was he good in My Giant?  Look at the movie poster.  That's hilarious.  God.  The Giant's holding him up, so they're the same height.  And Billy Crystal's about two feet off the ground.  Yeah.  Was he floating or something?  I know.  The guy's holding him up there, Chip. 
[00:23:30]  You can see his hand.  Oh, that's what's his name, too.  I think he played in the NBA.  Years.  What?  He can't still be alive.  Oh, that guy.  He's alive.  He played in the NBA for a few seasons.  Does he also have that voice?  Oh, yeah.  He's one of those guys.  Yeah.  Pleasure to be here, guys.  I noticed you didn't do that voice to the 7'8 animal that was in your globetrotters.  That sounded exactly like that.  I didn't want to insult him.  I could get away from him.  He ain't catching me. 
[00:24:00]  Walk under him.  I know.  I'd be doing like when Spanky was trying to get away from somebody on the little rascals.  He'd always run under their legs, turn around, and run back.  He'd just try to reach for you.  Yeah.  Brr.  Run away from him.  Clooney makes studio films of independent justice theory.  The odds of Marx and of Descendants.  Five nominations.  Time to prove the Descendants is a cinema delight.  And if Oscar wants to welcome Clooney Wright, maybe Oscar will be Lane George tonight.  Hawaiian.  It's a Hawaiian. 
[00:24:30]  Oh.  I love the night in Paris.  That rich, romantic style.  And Owen Wilson was so bright as Moody the Gentile.  Hi.  Oh, the big finish.  Slept.  Do you know the fucking work and money that goes into what you're listening to?  What are you talking about? 
[00:25:00]  The band, the fucking stage, the Billy's out there.  They have to rehearse a lot.  Rehearsals.  And it is what, this is the equivalent of sitting and watching the worst Broadway show ever.  It's, it's, it's just, and these celebrities got to sit there and just watch this guy and clap and smile.  They enjoy it though because for them.  They can't enjoy that.  They do because it's, it's, it's not a harsh take on what they do.  They love what is not a harsh take on what they do. 
[00:25:30]  I'm telling you, that's why they, they wouldn't have somebody who they didn't enjoy more than once.  Well, they, yeah, because they feel, they feel comfortable knowing that someone's not going to come in the room and fuck Chris, who I thought Chris Rock was great.  Cause I mean, as a standup, I just love the fact that he went out there and just shit on him.  Oh yeah.  The only thing, what did he say about Tim Robbins when he's not boring you with his movies, he's boring you with his politics or something.  It was some complete fucking decapitation of Tim Robbins. 
[00:26:00]  They don't want to hear that shit.  They can't handle it.  We got the Chris Rock clip.  I can't wait to play it.  This is from last night.  Yeah, of course.  Well, he did a great job last night as well.  Here's the, the, uh, finale of the big song.  Yes, the Southland gave birth to the house.  Then though the girl was white, she saw their price and wrote about it.  Now they had a voice.  They had a choice.  They took this down.  But just go figure. 
[00:26:30]  The girl that has all had the rest.  All, all, all, all, it was best.  It's the Oscar.  So take off your shoes.  I didn't understand half the words then. 
[00:27:00]  Once again.  I didn't see all the movies either.  Huh?  I didn't see all the movies.  I didn't see all the references.  Not many people did is what a lot of people were saying.  Not a lot of people.  There was no excitement about these movies.  Well, first of all, the movie that won Best Picture there, the artist, most people haven't  seen because they didn't, they didn't roll it out to the country.  No.  They were scared.  It's a silent film.  Which ones did you see?  I saw The Artist.  I saw The Artist.  Moneyball.  I saw Moneyball. 
[00:27:30]  I saw the Moneyball.  The Iron Lady?  No.  That was very good.  It was a boring movie, but she was phenomenal.  I saw Midnight in Paris.  That was the ever-  I really liked Midnight in Paris.  I thought he should have, maybe he shouldn't have beat Hugo, but that was great too.  I did not see Hugo.  Me neither.  I did not see-  The Help.  The Help, I did not see.  I saw that.  It was good, but very overrated because of what it was about.  It was a decent movie.  The Help?  Decent movie.  Oh, that means I don't have to see it.  Good.  What about the George Clooney one?  Descendants.  Very boring. 
[00:28:00]  I thought Clooney was decent in The Descendants, but I think he's a- he bores me as an actor.  I always feel I have to see all these movies, and now I know I don't have to.  He's a bore.  Yeah.  Like Christopher Walken, everything he does or you're interested in, like every-  Clooney's just the opposite.  There was no like-  Talking Walken, baby.  We missed Talking Walken.  That's because we were booked on it and then canceled because it was a big mix-up.  Well, I told Kevin, I can't do Talking Walken.  No, no, you couldn't, but I said I would do it, and then-  Then he's writing me that he'd feel so bad. 
[00:28:30]  I'm like, tell Jimmy.  You don't have to feel bad.  I just-  Yeah.  I'm not angry.  I just- I wouldn't have canceled my cellar spot.  And you're on vacation.  You could have done Talking Walken, man, with Kevin Pollack.  Oh, shit.  Talking Walken is going to set the podcast world on fire, I'm telling you.  You sit there and you watch him tell stories as Walken, you've got to try to figure out  how to get in on it.  All right.  I'm not saying anything I haven't- I didn't say to Kevin's face Friday.  I'm like, that's the problem here.  Oh, is that what it was?  I'm going to look like a dummy trying to figure out when I'm supposed to jump in because Walken 
[00:29:00]  is not the easiest guy to talk to, no matter if it's the actual Christopher Walken or someone  doing the impression.  Or someone doing an impression, right.  It's a lot of go-stop, go-stop stuff.  It's an inside joke.  We were making fun of the talk and Walken for a few days now.  Yeah?  Oh, yeah.  I missed out on that one.  Yeah.  So there you go.  There's Billy Crystal's opening number and, you know-  It was all downhill from there.  It didn't kill, but it didn't- I don't know. 
[00:29:30]  There are just some of those years with the Oscars.  There's some years where there's at least one standout movie where it's like, wow.  Now, you could say The Artist, because it won the awards, you know, a bunch of awards,  but it wasn't a standout movie that people saw, people liked, it had known actors in  it.  I'm talking like Cuckoo's Nest.  Sure.  Shit like that.  Like, that's like, holy shit, this is going to be, you know, a big year.  A lot of people have admitted that it was a bad year for movies.  Horrible!  But The Artist was a really good film. 
[00:30:00]  The problem is, like I said, they didn't roll it out to the country, so no one has seen  it.  But I guess now they're going to throw it in every theater.  And I mean, really, fucking Bridesmaids, nominated for anything, yeah, it's your cute little  comedy, but no one and nothing should have been nominated with that movie.  I kind of like when a comedy gets nominated for some shit.  Melissa McCarthy was hilarious in that movie.  She was, she wasn't, she didn't do anything.  She really was funny, man.  Kristen Wiig, I thought, was actually really, acting-wise, did a great job.  Like, I don't mind her getting some type of- 
[00:30:30]  But is she acting?  Because it seems like that's how she-  Probably not.  She walks through life.  She walks through life as that character, it seems like.  But yeah, for her to be nominated.  That's why Best Supporting is, supporting is usually a bullshit.  They throw bones with supporting.  Yeah.  You like Bridesmaid, right, Ant?  Yeah.  Or Bridesmaids?  I thought it was funny, yeah.  Did you like Melissa McCarthy in that?  Yeah.  She stole the fucking movie.  It's just, nah, I didn't think so.  She's doing the old, okay, look, the fat girl.  Wow.  What was it, Norm Macdonald last night on Twitter? 
[00:31:00]  It's like, yeah, when fat ladies want to have sex, it's funny.  Fat ladies.  She was.  Not that we talk about fashions, but holy fuck, her dress was horrendous.  I know that much.  I know that much about dresses where I'm like, what the fuck are you wearing?  I mean, every joke from the shower curtain to the tablecloth to the fucking-  Could not fucking take my eyes off of that disaster.  It was horrendous.  It was cinched up. 
[00:31:30]  It was like, her tits were being held up.  It was unbelievable how bad that was.  I don't know.  She should have just went up there in Guy's clothes.  Yeah, just wear some slacks.  Why not?  Did you know she was from Mike and Molly?  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know.  I didn't know.  Well, they gave her the show after The Bridesmaids, right?  Was it after?  I believe.  No.  Oh, I don't know.  Or was Mike and Molly already happening?  I don't know.  I think it was already on.  It was already on.  Sorry.  I apologize.  I have no idea.  Yeah, no, I knew that. 
[00:32:00]  Look at that fucking dress.  You look so beautiful tonight.  Stop lying.  You don't have to be Kelly Osbourne to know that that dress sucks.  Look at this thing.  Did they trash her or were they like, you know, she looks so pretty.  They said they didn't like the dress in their own way.  Oh, they did.  But they have to be very careful about how they say it, I'm sure.  Look at them boulder holders.  Oh, no.  Some broads should just not put makeup on. 
[00:32:30]  Don't even bother.  Don't bother.  Don't bother.  Yeah.  You fucking walk around in the supermarket sometimes.  You just see some fat slob.  And she's got pierced ears and her earlobes are literally resting on her neck fat.  You ever see where the earlobes bend?  Oh, where they push outwards?  Yeah, they're resting on fat.  It's like, really?  You decided to poke a fucking earring through there to what?  Draw attention to that?  Yeah. 
[00:33:00]  My God, man.  What else do you want to do?  The opposite end of the spectrum was Angelina Jolie, who was disturbing to look at.  Her arms were horrible.  Those arms are horrible.  She puts her leg out like, wow, I'm going to be sexy up here.  I don't find her sexy.  Not at all.  I'm telling you, man.  I think.  Maybe during the Billy Bob years, she had a little something going on.  I'm telling you right now, I think Jennifer Ashton is sexier than Angelina Jolie.  I really do.  Yeah.  Because she got way too thin or something. 
[00:33:30]  I think she's so delusional because she's fucking Brad Pitt that it's like, I got to be hot.  I'm banging this guy.  He's like the catch.  I think she looks good, man.  Do you?  Yeah.  I don't think she's the same.  She's no Scarlett Johansson, but I think she looks fuckable.  Just a little meat, though, man.  She got rid of all her meat.  Her arms are frightening.  Yeah.  They were very frightening.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I like Jennifer Ashton better.  And, oh, boy, that segment where they all just sat for a close-up on their faces as they discussed what movies were. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, God.  When they went to their first movie, who gave a shit?  Why did they allow Adam Sandler as part of that?  Oh, you know, I remember going to my first movie.  It was like, oh, I'm at the movies.  I'm at the movies.  But then, you know, I wanted to be in the movies.  So I just thought, oh, let me get a ticket to the movie.  Shut up.  I get that he makes movies. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah, yeah.  It was obvious he was the one that didn't belong.  I guess he got 11 Razzies this year for Jack and Jill.  Basically saying one of the worst movies ever made, this Jack and Jill, as far as mainstream movies go.  If you interview someone, Adam Sandler would come in.  Look at Adam Sandler.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I remember that gang.  Fuck Adam Sandler.  We're done with him, too.  Enough already.  Adam will come in.  Oh, no.  He thought he had done.  Oh, you got to take a bunch of stupid guests.  I've had enough with all of these people. 
[00:35:00]  Of course.  That fucking treat the show bad.  Of course.  Fuck all of them.  We don't need any of them, man.  In the end, we don't need any of them.  Fuck Adam Sandler.  I'm sick of being teased with Adam Sandler.  We have to jump through hoops and maybe Adam Sandler, then we'll do our show.  Yeah.  Fuck yourself.  Really, man.  I thought Natalie Portman did a fair job at what she had to do, introducing the best actor nominees. 
[00:35:30]  She could actually read, I guess.  I guess they have a reader there in Hollywood.  Because she, you know, it was all fucking schmaltzy drivel that she was saying.  She's pretty hot.  But at least she presented it good.  She's pretty hot.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's hotter than Angelina Jolie, too, man.  Oh, yeah.  Well, she's got a little more youth on her side.  People get tricked by the lips of Angelina Jolie.  Tricked by them?  I've never liked those fucking things.  They're always chapped.  God, they're always a disaster.  Angelina's lips.  She's got pillow lips. 
[00:36:00]  Pillow lips?  Yes.  It's terrible.  Hard to keep those moist.  You wouldn't put your dick between those, Ant?  Come on.  Leave some abrasions.  Look, I wouldn't turn down the head from Angelina Jolie, okay?  She wouldn't turn it down from a guy.  Jesus.  Wow.  Wow.  Why not?  Hey, shut your eyes.  You don't know any better if you shut your eyes.  What about the Nick Nolte? 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, that was frightening.  Death Watch?  Yeah, that was frightening.  Because then they're showing clips from his movie, and it's like, wow, there's a bit of  a drop-off from the movie to the live, Nick Nolte.  I think...  I guess he likes the sauce, huh?  Oh.  Seems like it.  You got a clip of Nick Nolte on the red carpet?  His head was just...  It looked like his blood pressure, it was like blood to just like a sprinkler come out  of his ears.  Yeah.  The really gray hair and then the fucking beet red face. 
[00:37:00]  Bad for him.  And I don't think that's the California sun doing that.  No.  I think that might be a little booze.  And then they were interviewing him, and he couldn't hear anything.  What's that?  What's that?  Is this it?  I hated this chick.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  That's the one, though.  Are they going to...  Huh?  They're keeping clips off the internet there, Sambo?  Yeah.  That's too bad, because we want to hear Nick Nolte.  There's no way to stop it, man.  It's the internet.  Why would they keep clips off it?  I don't know.  I mean, by the end of today, no one's going to give a shit about this. 
[00:37:30]  Get all the clips out today.  That's why the Oscars are irrelevant in a way, because you want younger people to watch  them.  Young people go on the internet, so if you want to have a bunch of clips floating around,  you might catch some interest from some of your clips.  Yeah.  But that's why these antiquated fucking dummies aren't getting a younger doll.  Right.  Yeah.  Because these big events, they go away really fast in this new world, man.  Literally, by tomorrow, no one's going to be talking about the Oscars anymore. 
[00:38:00]  What is this?  All right, let's go.  I actually watched last night.  Now, this is your third Oscar nomination.  Congrats.  You said that you were touched, but not excited.  Now that you're here all dressed up, are you a bit itty-bitty excited?  Well, you know, if I knew what you said, I could probably answer you.  So I'll say yes, yes, yes.  You can't hear.  You're excited?  Yes, I'm excited.  Of course.  I have a little quiz for you.  It's true or false, you own a pet crow. 
[00:38:30]  What did I do?  You own a pet crow.  Oh, God.  Oh, I have a crow.  You do, is it true?  Oh, yes, yes.  I've had two crows.  True or...  I had John David Crowe, who was in U-Turn.  And Jim Crowe.  He'd chase all the jiggabos out of my yard.  They'd walk in, he'd peck at their eyes and say, get out of here.  And true or false, you had a pinball machine that used to predict how well your movie would  do.  Is that right?  I had a pinball machine that you could not tell, so you could run up scores quite high. 
[00:39:00]  Why are they...  I hope it predicts Oscars.  Pause this, stand for a second.  I hope it predicts...  How about we just throw it away?  This is the most inane fucking interview.  Well, that's all it is, man.  It's a great nickname.  And now he can't hear again when she...  Oh, really?  Can you go back a little bit?  What'd I do?  Huh?  Oscars.  Oh, no.  Doesn't predict those at all.  Thank you for joining us and masses of luck tonight.  All right.  Thank you very much.  All right. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  What happened?  What happened to the good old days?  All right.  Remember him 48 hours?  Here's your goddamn dinner, convict.  I'm sorry about, you know, watermelon nigger.  It's fucking great.  Was Nolte good in his movie?  What movie was he in?  Warriors.  Warriors.  What was that?  MMA movie.  I hear that shit is good, man.  We got Sean William Scott coming in today, an old friend.  That's right.  Oh.  He's, uh...  What's he got going?  I don't know. 
[00:40:00]  He's in a hockey movie.  Oh, Goon?  He's promoting Goon?  I think so.  I hear it's on demand, and a bunch of people are tweeting me because I like the hockey,  saying this movie's really good.  Seriously, they're telling me it's really good.  Him and Liev Schreiber are in it.  Was it in theaters?  No.  Uh-oh.  I think it's one of those, like, indie, like, they're putting it out limited and on demand  at the same time.  I think it's similar to what they did with The Innkeepers.  Uh-oh.  Ah, but The Innkeepers did well.  Right.  It's a good movie.  So maybe The Goon is a good movie. 
[00:40:30]  About Liev.  Liev.  Liev.  Liev.  Liev Schreiber.  Liev?  No, it's just Liev.  Liev.  Unless you're at my house, I'll say that to you.  Liev.  What do you guys think of, uh, Sasha Baron Cohen?  Uh, The Dictator.  The Dictator spills ashes on Ryan Seacrest.  Boy, uh, Hollywood's abuzz about this one today.  Oh, they certainly are.  They love a viral moment.  Oh, my God.  Uh, yeah.  Trending worldwide.  Trending worldwide.  I can't imagine that Ryan Seacrest is all that stupid. 
[00:41:00]  That he wouldn't know that he was going to try to pull some shenanigans.  And when he's holding something that can contain something, you would think it's going to end  up on you.  And he really took no precaution whatsoever to guard himself from those, uh,  No, this is...  Alleged ashes of Kim Jong-il.  Hello, Death to the West.  They ask you, who are you wearing?  Death to the West.  I'm wearing John Galliano, but the, uh, socks are from, uh, Kmart.  Can we, can we get a tight shot of the socks? 
[00:41:30]  Oh, wow.  Which, which section of the Kmart store were those in?  This takes balls, by the way, you gotta think.  No?  Yeah.  So, you're going for a stunt on the red carpet at the Oscars?  Is coming to the Oscars one of the best perks of, uh, whatever it is your job is?  Yes, I love it here because, uh, it, um, it gave me an opportunity to bring  my dear friend and doubles tennis partner, Kim Jong-il.  It was his dream to come to the Oscars and, uh, to be sprinkled over the red carpet and 
[00:42:00]  over Halle Berry's chest again.  The funny, the interesting thing is actually, it's actually made by...  Spilled Kim Jong-il on him.  You've got Kim Jong-il on...  Wait a minute, we need to do this stuff.  No, if somebody...  It's fine, it's okay for you.  No, no, if somebody asks you what you're wearing, you will...  Now they're fucking strong-arming him out of there.  And you spilled him all over them. 
[00:42:30]  You know, part of me thought you would be up to something, Juliana.  It's usually on his back.  I don't know in what fashion or form.  Enjoy your asses.  We'll be right back.  Live from the red carpet.  Yes, Jim.  We don't even know what to say.  This is crazy.  We're like, species.  Wait, do you know how lucky you are, Tom?  That you were, like, the one chosen on the red carpet?  The chosen.  I think that I'm lucky.  Is this a vision of luck?  No, I'm not kidding.  Brian, of every red carpet reporter, every single person on the red carpet, you were chosen by the dictator. 
[00:43:00]  I'm not kidding.  My dream would be to be part of that right now.  I don't know.  By the way, every camera beside me and above me is shooting this right now.  And I'm not quite sure what to make of it.  Maybe you have your swundress moment of the night.  She was talking about rifles.  This is going to be trending worldwide in about one second.  This is going to be on every single home page.  You know what's strange is that I saw that, and I saw it getting closer to me, and I thought to myself, is there really anything in it?  And now I realize the answer is yes. 
[00:43:30]  Brian, your face, you were like, okay, are you joking me right now?  That was probably the most priceless moment on TV.  What are you thinking right now, Ryan?  Well, I'm thinking that who's ever going to do that to me or George Clooney, right?  There we go.  Oh, my.  It kind of took you one second for the ride to realize.  It's a funny fucking dude.  Take that asshole.  If you come back live here, I think I'm in shock for him.  I've come back live.  Our friends here, thank you very much, are just sort of pitching.  Thank you.  Are pitching in.  I can keep it. 
[00:44:00]  Thank you.  Pitching in.  They brought a towel.  I don't know why you have a towel.  They have a towel.  I think you need a lint.  And then we've got a napkin.  So we're going to clean a lint brush.  We're going to clean ourselves up and come back live from the red carpet.  Hey, he was a good sport, guys.  He was a good sport.  You know, he's a good sport about it.  Ryan, you're a good sport.  How funny were those R's?  When he just kept the R's.  Rolling the R's.  His R's made me laugh.  Sasha rules.  He's a funny, funny fucking guy, man.  I hope he comes in to promote the dictator. 
[00:44:30]  I've never met him.  He's a guy who I would love to meet.  You weren't in that day?  No, I was in Pittsburgh.  He was great.  I was very jealous.  He is a funny bastard, man.  But he comes in in character.  You can't break the character thing.  No.  But that's fine.  His character is good.  Yeah, because he was Borat when he came into our show.  And he was not breaking character.  Speaking of Borat.  Borat.  Hey, Kenny.  Hi, Kenny.  Okay.  I missed you, Kenny. 
[00:45:00]  I missed you, too.  Jesus.  Walking dead.  Well, we got a couple more clips after the break.  Oscar moments?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  I don't know.  We got the Chris Rock thing now that we're going to play the break without talking over.  Yeah.  Because it was great.  I think this was the best moment of the whole fucking show right here.  Everyone said he looked like D.L.  Oh, really?  With his little afro.  He looks good, though.  He looked good.  Considering he's like, what is he, 47 or something? 
[00:45:30]  48?  Yeah.  His afro.  You know what's weird?  You look at that goddamn Tom Cruise when he came out.  What the fuck is that about?  He looks younger.  And then you look at Kelly McGillis.  Holy fuck.  They were both in Top Gun together.  Right.  And wow.  Right.  I don't know.  I think there might be something to that Scientology.  It's kind of creepy.  He looks way younger, and he doesn't look like fucking weird.  Like weird work done.  Yeah, face work younger.  He's so healthy, though, man. 
[00:46:00]  The guy probably eats nothing bad.  He probably has really delicious food, healthy cook.  He's like, when you have that kind of money, you can eat the healthiest stuff that doesn't  suck.  He's pushing 50.  He looked like he was 35 years old last night.  Tops.  And what about Michelle Williams?  You dig that short hair on her?  She's a sexy broad with that short hair.  Come on.  I don't care about that short hair.  And I'm not usually one for short hair.  She's great.  Yeah.  She just looks great.  What was she in?  She was in that Marilyn thing. 
[00:46:30]  Playing some Marilyn Monroe.  Yeah.  Hey, Marilyn Monroe there.  She was up for an Oscar for that, I guess.  That's why she was there.  Yeah, I guess so.  She was there to look like she had taken a fistful of Xanax.  She was just...  She's perfect for you, huh?  You like her?  Yeah, she's a little crazy.  That short hair makes her look boyish, though, a little bit.  What?  I know she's sexy, but that short hair.  It's that Hollywood thing. 
[00:47:00]  A little bit we grow it out.  Yeah, you could.  Just a little bit.  She looks like JFK there, except this blonde.  It's short, but it's feminine short.  It's, you know, she's got that glamorous, short, blonde, Hollywood hair.  That's boy short.  Not feminine short.  She looks pretty goddamn good.  Yeah, she's fucking sexy, but...  I'd smooch with her.  All right, we'll do more Oscar shit, but first, Chris Rock fucking killing it last night. 
[00:47:30]  Hit it.  Now, I love animation.  I love animation because in the world of animation, you can be anything you want to be.  If you're a fat woman, you can play a skinny princess.  If you're a short, wimpy guy, you can play a tall gladiator.  If you're a white man, you can play an Arabian prince.  And if you're a black man, you can play a donkey or a zebra.  Now, I can't play white. 
[00:48:00]  My God.  Now, I hate when people go on TV and tell you how hard it is to do animation.  It's like, oh, Jay, it's such hard work.  It's so hard doing animation, getting into character.  No, no, no.  UPS is hard work, okay?  Stripping wood is hard work.  I've done some animation, and here's how easy it is.  It's the easiest job in the world.  I go in a booth, and I go, oh, what's the line? 
[00:48:30]  And the guy goes, it's time to go to the store.  And then I go, it's time to go to the store.  And you like that?  Oh, we can move on?  Okay.  And then I go, well, what's the next line?  He goes, oh, it's getting dark outside.  It's getting dark outside.  And then they give me a million dollars.  You're listening to the O.P. and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM. 
[00:49:00]  Welcome back to Cock Talk.  I'm Mistress Vixen.  Today, we're talking about your first man-on-man experience.  We have Mars on the phone from Puerto Rico.  Mars, talk to me, baby.  I'm a changed man, as of yesterday.  Yeah, I'm a fucking changed man.  I'm not the same.  Mars, I see here you had your first gay experience last night. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  Yummy.  So tell me, what was that little asshole of yours like before the big night?  My shit is so tight, man.  I guess I'm anal retentive.  It's so tight.  Mm, sexy.  And what was going through your head when you whipped out that big dick?  He tells me to lie down on my left side, and I'm facing a particular direction.  And then he pulls his apparatus out.  I'm like, hell no, that shit is not going near me.  Sure enough, he goes behind me. 
[00:50:00]  How big was it?  It was, I swear to God, about two feet long.  Ooh, you're a spicy little bitch, aren't you?  And what did he say before he put it in you?  Did he ease it in?  I'm just feeling for a second, and all of a sudden, this motherfucker, all the way in my ass.  Oh, boy.  Ooh, you lucky little taquito.  Tell me more.  He goes like this.  Come on, buddy.  Help me.  Help me here.  Work with me.  Let me do my job.  What was that job? 
[00:50:30]  Open my ass.  I don't know how you guys do it.  Just letting that rainbow-striped freak flag fly.  Come on.  Alcohol.  Howdy, alcohol.  This all sounds so dirty.  How'd you get cleaned up after?  Did he do it for you?  Yeah, he cleaned it afterwards.  No, he did it afterwards in front of me.  No, he did.  Ooh, how did he do that?  What is it?  Toss salad?  You could toss my salad any time.  Ooh, he licked your asshole clean with his tongue?  Exactly.  My God, Mars. 
[00:51:00]  You are so naughty.  Any guy would be lucky to go south of the border with you.  This is our secret.  Don't tell anybody.  What I wouldn't give to have a dick sometimes.  Well, tune in next week when Cock Talk returns and we talk to guys about their first time with a down-low brother, Mars.  I bet you have a story like that, don't you?  Yeah.  Ooh, you little Spanish fly.  You've got me all wet.  See you next week for more Cock Talk. 
[00:51:30]  Sirius XM.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show.  What else should I be? 
[00:52:00]  All of our days.  Getting topical.  Hold up.  Wait a minute.  With the Sex Man.  Good morning, sexy.  No patience for this bit anymore.  I'm glad you were laughing.  That made you laugh, right?  Yeah, it did.  All right, good.  I guess we're getting topical, huh?  Sure, why not?  Nirvana, Kurt Cobain, All Apologies.  Oh, what could this possibly be?  Oh, Ben and Jerry? 
[00:52:30]  Yes.  Nice!  I got this one.  What happened?  What?  That's it.  This is a good one.  Why is it a good one?  Playing All Apologies for an Apology.  Oh, you like this one?  That's a good one.  It's a good getting topical?  Yes.  Ed, you've been gone for a while.  You missed Linsanity.  Linsanity got completely out of control while you were gone.  I was keeping tabs.  Completely out of control.  I was keeping tabs.  And then he had a horrendous game against the Miami Heat to calm everybody down a little  bit, I think.  This guy might turn into a bust.  It just might have been one of those things. 
[00:53:00]  It was like a little fluke.  Yeah, a little what?  What do they call it?  Flash in the...  Flash in the pan.  Yeah.  Now, what's that bottle one?  Like a little flash in the...  Lightning in a bottle.  Oh, is that it?  I don't know.  Is it lightning in a bottle?  Look it up.  Yeah, you can say that.  So, the Ben and Jerry's thing, they had to apologize.  God, you can't fuck around with Linsanity.  The Asians are fucking paying attention.  They don't like the...  Yeah. 
[00:53:30]  Someone...  I don't even know if we have Asian listeners.  I really don't.  I know we have black listeners.  Sure.  I know we have some geese.  Uh-huh.  And I know we have some broads.  But I honestly don't know if we have Asians.  I really don't.  Yeah.  But someone's got to explain to me why Ben and Jerry's had to apologize for the Jeremy  Lynn ice cream thing.  They decided to come up with a Jeremy Lynn ice cream.  It's called Taste the Linsanity, right?  Uh-huh.  And I guess they had pieces of fortune cookies in there.  All right. 
[00:54:00]  And I guess quickly Ben and Jerry there said, oh, my God, we got to recall all our ice cream  because the fortune cookies are getting soggy.  Or the pieces of fortune cookies.  No, that's what they said at first to try to save face.  But now I guess the Asian groups are pissed off that fortune cookies were in the middle  of ice cream.  Why?  Why?  Well, what are they saying?  I mean...  Maybe I got it in front of me.  I don't understand why that's a problem.  I don't get fortune cookies when I order Italian food. 
[00:54:30]  You know?  But every time you order Chinese food, you get a fortune cookie.  Right, you get fortune cookie.  But it would probably be like taking a black player and then giving him watermelon-flavored  ice cream.  No, that's a stretch.  All this is just a stretch.  People overthinking everything.  Fucking Chinese people love giving you fortune cookies, period.  So if you got an ice cream that's named after a Chinese fucking player, what's the problem  with the fortune cookies in the middle?  Things don't even have to be offensive anymore for a group to be upset about it. 
[00:55:00]  You just have to point something obvious out.  Right.  And I don't even mean like a stereotype.  Right.  Or anything.  I mean, just point out the obvious.  Hey, Chinese restaurants give out fortune cookies.  Right.  So let's put fortune cookies in this because it's an ice cream that commemorates a Chinese  guy.  Why is it offensive?  I really want to know.  I guess I could read a little bit here for you.  Ben & Jerry's is apologizing for briefly offering a Jeremy Lin-inspired frozen yogurt that includes  fortune cookie pieces in an acknowledgement that the dish could be seen as playing on Asian 
[00:55:30]  stereotypes.  What's the stereotype?  What are we playing on here?  Yeah, exactly.  Like I understand.  We're celebrating their culture.  Where's the stereotype?  Jimmy, do you agree?  Yes, but I know what their argument would be is that his abilities as a player have nothing  to do with his ethnicity.  So honoring him as a player, his ethnicity shouldn't come into play.  I mean, that would be their position.  China is so proud that there's an Asian in the NBA, so let's ignore that. 
[00:56:00]  You know how many people are watching basketball in the NBA right now because of Jeremy Lin?  How many Asians are?  It's a no-win, dude.  It's a no-win.  I know, but it's ridiculous.  They only want to use your stereotype when they want to â€“ it's weird.  Like what is â€“ if you tribute somebody and honor their culture, that's acceptable.  Right.  But if you do it this way, it's race.  You can't win.  There's no consistency to the â€“ there's no logic to it.  90% of China is watching the NBA right now because there's an Asian player playing. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  Okay?  So why can't we fucking have some fortune cookies in the ice cream?  That sounds delicious.  I would like that.  He's an Asian player, and to honor an Asian player â€“ do Taiwanese people get fortune cookies?  Because he's Taiwanese.  Yeah, sure.  I've seen it.  Yeah, why not?  If your eyes go a little this way, I think you get a fortune cookie from those people.  Yeah.  I don't know.  On behalf of Ben and Jerry's Boston Scoop Shops, we offer a heartful apology. 
[00:57:00]  Another apology.  If anyone was offended by our handmade Linsanity flavor that we offered at our Harvard Square location,  the company said Saturday on its Ben Jerry Boston Twitter account.  Who's offended?  Who?  And who gives a fuck about those people?  We're heartfelt sorry.  Everyone says they're sorry because mommy and daddy are mad.  Everyone says sorry.  No one says go fuck yourself anymore.  Yeah.  Just â€“ what? 
[00:57:30]  You mad?  Yeah.  Sorry.  Boston.com.  I don't mean â€“ I apologize.  I just mean, yeah, sorry.  Boston.com reported Friday that Ben and Jerry's replaced the fortune cookies with waffles.  What does waffles have to do with anything?  Oh, boy.  The Belgians are going to be very upset.  So they're trying to make it look like â€“ but they're still going for the fortune cookie thing in a way.  Yeah.  But waffles are safe, I guess.  After what a store manager called a bit of an initial backlash.  Oh, gosh.  Yeah.  We are proud â€“ 
[00:58:00]  Should have just dumped rice in it.  Yeah.  Yeah, we'll take the fortune cookies out.  Here's rice.  And giving you chopsticks to eat it.  Here you go.  Don't spill it on your hands.  Here you go, dick.  The top isn't the regular lid.  It's one of those pointy, tiny hats that the old rail workers used to wear.  They can't even stack them in the supermarket because they got the pointy hats.  Oh, just terrible.  That's great.  The whole container is shaped like a Viet Cong hooch.  You burn it when you're done.  Another apology to Jeremy Lin.  Can we stop apologizing to Jeremy Lin? 
[00:58:30]  You missed the rules of how to report on Jeremy Lin as you were aware.  I know.  I could get in big trouble.  We might have to go back to that to keep you safe there.  Help me out so I don't have to apologize.  Those rules.  Heartfelt and sincerely.  Well, here's the rest of the apology.  We are proud and honored to have Jeremy Lin hail from one of our fine local universities.  And we are huge sports fans, the Ben and Jerry statement said.  We were swept up in the nationwide Linsanity momentum. 
[00:59:00]  Our intention was to create a flavor to honor Jeremy Lin's accomplishments and his meteoric.  Meteor, meteoric, meteoric, meteoric, oh my God, rise in the NBA and recognize that he was a local Harvard graduate.  We try, demonstrate our commitment as a Boston-based value-led business.  And if we failed in this instance, we offer our sincere apologies.  Holy fuck.  Are you serious?  A lot of apologies going on. 
[00:59:30]  And wouldn't that just be fun?  A little ice cream with a fucking fortune cookie in there.  Why not?  Sounds delicious.  Yeah.  But sorry.  Sorry.  And yeah, the guy got fired.  I'm sorry.  The chink in the armor line.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And people lose their jobs.  They're apologizing.  They're scrambling to stay out of trouble.  I'm sorry.  I'm looking for an Asian. 
[01:00:00]  Oh, yeah.  Fortune cookies were created in America.  It doesn't matter where they were created.  Yeah, they are.  It's whatever gets, like, fucking picked up now.  Yeah.  There it is.  It was in America.  Yeah, well, it's tied to Asians.  I don't know.  Whatever.  Taste of insanity.  What was the flavor, by the way?  Vanilla with honey swirls and fortune cookies.  Vanilla.  Huh?  Vanilla with honey swirls and fortune cookies.  They should replace the fortune cookies with yellow cake. 
[01:00:30]  Ah, that'd be good.  Mmm.  I like yellow cake.  That's all I'm saying.  Right.  Love yellow cake.  Eh, who wouldn't?  Terrific.  Boy, another, uh...  I fucking went with Ben and Jerry's over the weekend, by the way.  Oh.  I've been trying to avoid this shit for a long time.  I couldn't help myself anymore.  Cookie dough.  You see the...  You're sitting, eating cookie dough ice cream?  Oh, my God.  All day long. 
[01:01:00]  Were you crying?  Were you watching the Oscars eating cookie dough?  And then I went with mint chocolate chip, because now they come in, like, 3.7-ounce containers.  Oh.  You know how small a 3.7-ounce container is?  Oh, too small for me.  I'd eat 10 of them.  Oh, so would I, including the lid.  But the problem was, in the bigger container, they didn't have a variety of flavors for some reason.  But in those tiny... 
[01:01:30]  Look how tiny that is.  I had to buy, like, five of those.  That's normal size next to the regular container.  It's 3.6 or 7 ounces.  Just to make you feel better about yourself while you're just indulging.  Just so you get a little taste.  Oh.  Fuck yeah.  I've been in Jerry's all day long.  There's no better ice cream, man.  Where do you go?  Hog and does.  Eh.  I haven't eaten ice cream in a while.  What's wrong with you?  I don't know.  You don't like ice cream?  Every so often, you know, dessert at a restaurant, get some a la mode on that apple crisp stuff. 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, but they only offer, like, vanilla.  Yeah.  That's fine by me.  I'm not a big ice cream eater guy.  Really?  No.  You like cookies, right?  Yeah, but I'm not crazy like that.  I like a good oatmeal cookie.  Yeah, rules.  Yeah.  How about oatmeal ice cream?  Fucking rules, man.  Yeah.  Is there such a thing?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, there's not. 
[01:02:30]  Oatmeal ice cream is fucking phenomenal.  They have something.  I don't remember where I had it, but it really is wonderful.  Thanks, sweetie.  Yeah.  Well, we couldn't find an Asian to help us out today.  I told you.  No Asians listen to this show.  No?  Nope.  See?  Not a one.  We can say whatever we want.  What about a sort of Asian?  Are they listening?  Will they have a little Asian in them?  What would that entail?  Like a Tiger Woods?  Yeah, because I want to be educated.  Why is this shit so offensive?  Why?  We're celebrating your culture with this shit. 
[01:03:00]  Yeah.  See?  We're helping out.  We're letting other people know what your culture's about.  Ice cream and fortune cookies.  It's not either of those things.  Huh?  That's the point of fortune cookies being made in America.  It's not their culture.  Then why do they serve them in, like, Chinese restaurants?  I mean, same reason why in China, Chinese food doesn't taste like here.  It doesn't?  No, it does.  They make sweet and sour chicken.  How do you know?  Have you ever gone anywhere?  No, I used to date a Chinese girl. 
[01:03:30]  And she just told you that?  Yeah.  I mean, who else would tell me?  The Chinese girl that cut herself and fucking fell down a lot?  That wasn't her.  No?  What was her malfunction?  Yeah, what was wrong with her?  She was fine, but that relationship didn't last long.  Why?  Because she was boring.  Yeah, because...  Oh, what are you saying about Asian people?  Yeah, what are you saying?  You're saying Asians are boring, huh?  That's right.  All of them.  They kind of are.  Every last one.  All they want to do is work.  Yeah.  Yep.  All they want to do is fucking work.  You didn't like that she kept calling you Mr. Sam? 
[01:04:00]  If they could work 24 hours a day, they would do it.  For what reason, in the end?  You don't fucking enjoy your money.  No, you just set up a cot at work.  Wake up after an hour, sit and nap, and go back to work.  And you're good to go for another 20 hours?  That's how it works.  You know, when this shit comes out, it makes me go fucking harder with stereotypes.  I know.  Yes.  What's wrong with us?  I get that mad where I'm like, oh, really?  Watch what we can do with this stereotype thing.  Yeah.  Because it's phony.  That's why.  Is that what it is?  The apologies are phony.  The outrage is manufactured. 
[01:04:30]  And it's almost like you're watching people lie.  Like, the people pretending to be offended are liars.  And the apologizers are liars.  Right.  Everyone is lying.  We're pretending we're offended.  We're pretending we're sorry.  And the whole thing, it's like you're watching a three-act play, and no one is just screaming,  this is a fucking play.  Right.  And it affects what we're doing.  Yeah.  That's why it's so enraging.  And Dan and Jerry should just go, tough shit.  I'm going to continue with this ice cream.  Of course they should.  I mean, I don't even, I don't, fuck it.  I'll say it.  I don't think Asians like ice cream. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, that was all Greg Opie Hughes.  I didn't.  Asians love a good ice cream.  I'm kidding.  They don't have desserts in their Chinese restaurants, do they now?  That horrible green tea ice cream.  Fuck you.  That's Japanese.  Oh.  It's grown on me a little too.  I hate Japanese ice cream.  Oh, my God, it's not sweet.  The greasy ice cream?  Get the fuck out of here.  No, no, no, no.  With a little red bean and a little bit of vanilla.  Bean?  What the fuck is that?  No!  It's supposed to be tasty ice cream.  No, dude, it really is.  I've eaten it.  Ant, mochi, it's to die for. 
[01:05:30]  I had some just the other day.  Oh, you didn't like it?  And I was like, take this shit away.  Are you all in with the mochi balls?  Fuck it.  What?  You've never had a mochi ball?  They're fucking good.  I am not having mochi balls.  Mochi or mochi?  Mochi.  Mochi balls.  Yeah, they're very tasty.  How about we get some mochi balls and turn Anthony on to some mochi balls?  I'm not eating mochi balls.  Now, this is something I could get into.  It's ice cream with a skin.  It's ice cream with foreskin.  Yeah, it basically has human skin on the outside.  All right, this sounds terrible.  And you bite through the fucking skin to get to the goodness. 
[01:06:00]  Our supermarket carries mochi balls.  They are good and it's terrible.  I get the vanilla ones.  Which ones do you get, Jimmy?  I only order them when I'm occasionally out at a very, very high-end restaurant.  I get, yeah, I buy mochi balls every once in a while.  I think I might have one of those.  That's one of those green tea ones.  That green tea shit sucks.  I hate green tea.  We got some Asians calling.  You want in?  Sure.  Let's talk to the Asians.  Here's a Sam Asian.  His name's Sam and he's Asian.  An Asian Sam. 
[01:06:30]  Sam, what's up?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  Hey, what's up, guys?  How you doing?  How Asian are you?  I'm half Asian.  I'm half Korean.  My dad's American.  My mom's Korean.  But, dude, I can't stand other Asian people, man.  I do not identify with that shit at all.  The problem being is that most Asian people are the most racist people you'll run across anyway.  How many times have you seen groups of Asians walking through the city and it's all just Asian people?  There's not one white person.  There's not one black person. 
[01:07:00]  It's just all Asian people.  I don't think the problem is the Asian people.  I think the problem is Asian special interest groups.  Right.  It's like it's not blacks who are the problem, who are offended by every little bit of humor.  It's black special interest groups.  The Asian special interest groups are very, very organized because, I mean, Asians are very computer savvy.  They are all online.  They get together very quickly.  What are you saying about Asians and the computers, Jimmy?  I'm stereotyping and I'm saying that they are intelligent and computer savvy. 
[01:07:30]  They don't mind that stereotype, right?  And organized.  So what happens is when something happens, Asians can mobilize a lot of people to send  out an email.  It's like the parents' television council.  And then it looks like everyone's outraged, but it's really just one special interest group.  But the companies then cater to them, which just amazes me.  Well, that's what I hate is that nobody just says, go fuck yourself.  All this could stop if the companies would just fucking say, go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Maybe not in that way, but just at least just ignore them.  We're sorry you feel that way.  Yeah, yeah.  Don't even say that.  Yeah, I understand, Jimmy.  And you know what? 
[01:08:00]  I would be mad at you for the stereotype, but I work in computers.  But that's not even a stereotype.  It's why the Asian special interest groups are very effective.  It's the same reason, like, the Catholic League is effective, because they have a network  that just knows how to get a tremendous amount of statements sent out immediately.  So it looks like there's a mobilizing of people across the country, but it's a very small group  that's actually just pushing a whole lot of shit out.  Yeah.  Right or wrong?  Crap.  Right or wrong? 
[01:08:30]  Well, I understand, and I think another thing about the Asians is that the culture is just  very closed, so they feel that a lot of what they, you know, since everything's so closed,  they have to keep their culture very tight, and they feel like any threat upon them or  upon their culture is a really big thing to other Asian people.  Well, and they also, I think like every other group, they have forgotten the difference  between making fun of somebody, which is allowable and okay, and trying to humiliate 
[01:09:00]  and hurt somebody, and there is a difference, and their whole thing as well, to allow someone  to be made fun of or to be stereotyped, is to foster an environment where they, and it's  just not true.  Why is the fortune cookie in the Ben and Jerry's ice cream bad?  I still don't know why.  Because it plays on a stereotype.  What would an Asian say?  But what's the stereotype?  Yeah, what would an Asian say there?  Well, they're saying that Jeremy Lin's a great basketball player.  And to honor him, you could just have a flavor, but you don't have to have a flavor that ties 
[01:09:30]  in with his ethnicity or a link to his ethnic background, which is irrelevant to his skills  as a bad, it would be like having, everyone is proud of where they came from.  Well, we're trying to fight these stereotypes, and it would be like having, you wouldn't see,  um, oh, something, uh, chocolatey or particularly black forest cake, uh, thrown in there just to  honor an African player, would you?  And we would prefer that our culture isn't stereotyped the same way. 
[01:10:00]  We like Jeremy Lin.  Why are we watching?  Oh, because he's Asian.  But we would prefer that you don't acknowledge that.  Only we can.  Yeah, that's the problem.  Oh.  See, they're showing that the game in Chinatown now, and for some reason, we understand we're  only watching because he's Asian, which gets us interested.  Right.  But please don't you acknowledge that.  Only we will.  Thank you, Jimmy.  That's perfect right there.  Yes.  That's perfect.  Seriously.  They are phony.  Everyone, all of them are phony.  Listen, I'm watching every Knicks game now, and absolutely, they're now cutting away to 
[01:10:30]  Chinatown to show a restaurant, a bar filled with nothing but Asians watching Jeremy Lin.  And they certainly wouldn't do that if Jeremy Lin wasn't playing.  No.  Why are they showing, by the way, why aren't they cutting away to Chinese restaurants to  show black players?  Don't stereotype and only think that Asians, oh, that's right.  That's right.  Can't have it both ways.  Can't have it both ways.  All right, Asian Sam, thank you.  All right, thanks, guys.  Have a good one.  All right, man.  Let me go to Chris in Tampa. 
[01:11:00]  Chris.  Konnichiwa.  Asian wants to talk to us.  Let me say, what's Korean?  Hello, OB.  I love ice cream.  Oh, Jesus.  Hey, man.  Punch it out, guys.  I love you.  I'll take phone calls like that all day long.  No problem.  All right.  So Ben and Jerry's had to apologize.  They got all excited, and then they had to apologize.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, no.  You can only mention the stereo, the Asians. 
[01:11:30]  You can only mention the ethnicity if you're that ethnicity.  Right.  If you're a black Philadelphia mayor, you can criticize black people.  If you're white, you're a racist.  If you point it out, it's racist.  Unless you're pointing out a positive, then you're honoring their culture.  Could somebody maybe just put out a book with all the rules, with all the special interest groups.  Give us a rule book so we can know how to pacify and speak to you in an appeasing manner.  Right.  So we never have to phonally, publicly apologize to you. 
[01:12:00]  Like the babies you are and need to be treated like.  Sure.  You know, we need those rules.  We honor the insert culture here.  Culture, thank you very much.  You know, I don't like that part of that culture.  Oh, you're a racist.  You're a culturist phobe.  Say you're sorry.  I'm very sorry that I mentioned that Islamic radicals act violent when their book is burned,  but do nothing to protest beheadings and honor killings and when rape victims have rocks thrown at them.  Hey, you're Islamophobic. 
[01:12:30]  The Islamic people are very peaceful people.  Thank you very much.  There's a man who understands Islam.  You just can't fucking win.  Let's say hi to Mikey.  Mikey.  Islamic people.  Hi, Mike.  Great call.  Thank you, sir.  I really appreciate the best call, Mike.  Absolutely.  Tom in Detroit.  Tom.  Yeah.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  So, Jimmy's absolutely right.  It's a bunch of crap.  I lived over in China for two years working for one of the big three auto manufacturers.  And first of all, they're racist just like we are. 
[01:13:00]  I had a nickname.  Dodge.  I had a nickname while I was there.  It was low way.  And it just means white guy.  General Motors.  And yes.  And so.  I'm surprised I didn't call you a horse cock.  I don't know.  I don't understand the logic that only white people could be racist.  I mean, everyone is fucking racist.  Because you need power to have racism.  No, you don't. 
[01:13:30]  Only white people grovel when accused of racism.  People don't deny that.  Because blacks and Asians have a lot of fucking back and forth, man.  Oh, yeah.  But Asians aren't guilty over.  Because they don't have a history with blacks that is filled with guilt and we're sorry.  Right.  So they're like, fuck you.  And blacks say, fuck you.  And so they have a more honest relationship.  It's confrontational.  Yeah.  But it's not filled with groveling on either side.  The blacks and Asians don't grovel before each other. 
[01:14:00]  They argue it out.  Hey, Jimmy, and this goes, this goes, this feeds right into the same way where you talk about words being removed from, you know, the English language.  It's exactly, we have to apologize for everything.  We have to remove words from the English language.  We just have to love everybody, which is a bunch of horse shit.  Hey, Jimmy, I'm going to see you on April at your first show.  Can't wait to see it in Cleveland.  Oh, thanks, man.  Right on.  And we're going to broadcast live.  Yes.  If the company doesn't fuck this one up, we'll be there supporting Jimmy.  Both shows sold out in about 14 hours, so totally clean on those. 
[01:14:30]  Thank you, Cleveland.  Very cool.  Punch it out, boy.  All right, bye.  And if they're saying that the fortune cookie is an American invention, so then it all goes together nice.  Yeah, look, see, we're all getting together in ice cream.  Right?  Sure.  Then that makes it even nicer for everyone.  But meanwhile, if an Asian restaurant was giving out, if a Chinese restaurant was honoring Jeremy Lin.  Don't say give out.  They don't give out anything.  That's true.  Yes, exactly. 
[01:15:00]  Holy fuck.  Here's a stereotype that's true.  The Asian customer service is by far the most disinterested and worst because they don't give a fuck because there's a billion Chinese people.  They don't give a fuck.  If you're like, I'm leaving.  Okay.  And then they just talk to the next guy.  They won't be mean to you.  They don't care.  If you say, I'm going outside to hang myself.  Okay.  And they just talk to the next guy.  People have no value to protest.  It's one of my favorite moments.  Patrice O'Neill talking about how he goes to a Chinese restaurant like three times a week and they don't even acknowledge him at all. 
[01:15:30]  They've never given him.  Care less.  They never gave him a free nothing.  They're the worst.  When it comes to that, they don't care.  Unbelievable.  I had it out at our supermarket on the phone because they fucked my order up and the customer service was so shitty.  And I finally went to the store manager when I threatened to go to the owners.  Right.  And he took really good care of me.  But abominable, abominable customer service.  But they're like robots, man.  Your food will be perfect every fucking time. 
[01:16:00]  Most times, yeah.  Most times it is.  Let me go to Hank and Sam.  But if you don't like something and you say, oh, man, I found a cockroach in this.  They'll take it away and you just assume they'll take it off your bill or maybe replace it.  Fuck no.  No.  It's like, seriously, I got to pay for this?  Let's say hi to this is crazy.  We got a Mexican-Asian on the line.  This could be the first in history for the show.  Hank, what do you got, buddy?  Yo me gustan los cookies fortune mucho. 
[01:16:30]  Y no quiero dar nothing for free.  What's that?  No me gusta, chef.  Como estas bien?  Mucho, mucho.  Thanks.  It's just the worst.  You don't think that was good?  No.  He's doing some kind of Asian accent while he's speaking broken Spanish.  Terrible.  We got Mr. Zen. 
[01:17:00]  He's Asian and he agrees that they should take the ice cream off the shelves.  Oh, Mr. Zen.  Let's say hi to Mr. Zen.  Mr. Zen.  Hello.  Yes, I believe that the ice cream is very racist.  Why?  Well, it is.  The first thing you think of is, oh, let's put fortune cookie inside the ice cream.  What the fuck is that?  Is that the only thing Asian out there or a fucking fortune cookie that's the best you can come of with?  I mean, what the fuck?  And I mean, have you ever seen Asian penis? 
[01:17:30]  It is so small.  So, so very small.  So, I mean, we get married at very nothing.  It's not so easy, is it?  No, it's not.  Boo!  Hey, Jimmy.  Yes, sir.  Hey, Jimmy.  I'm right here.  Oh, he might get you.  I know.  Yeah, he kind of knew where he was going.  He needed a safe face. 
[01:18:00]  That didn't work.  Well, we got a lot of Asians calling in there.  A lot of Asians.  I bet we do.  We do.  It's Linsanity.  You don't have Linsanity?  No.  Why don't you have Linsanity?  I've never went Linsane.  You don't care?  Over this whole thing.  I so don't care.  What if he quit?  I don't even care.  It doesn't affect me.  At all.  It doesn't affect my life.  I don't care.  Why don't you care?  It's about Linsanity.  It's making everyone feel good. 
[01:18:30]  Is it?  Yeah.  But I hear he sucks now.  No, he had a shitty game, but I think he was exhausted, to be honest with you.  We'll have to wait and see what he does after the All-Star break.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He was so bad that I think he just was fucking tired.  Oh, really?  How bad?  Real bad.  He shot, like, what did he shoot?  Less than 10% from the field.  Oh, boy.  Went for 11, I think, against the Heat.  He was really bad.  Like, way bad.  Did the sportscasters already start going, like, 
[01:19:00]  well, this, boy, we might have been seeing a fluke.  I think everyone's giving him the benefit of the doubt,  because he had the craziest two weeks ever, as far as sports goes.  You know?  And then everyone's gunning for him and playing him hard.  And then when he's not playing, he's doing a million interviews,  because now everyone wants to talk to the fucking guy.  Yeah.  And then he has to find a place to live.  I think he just was exhausted.  I'm hoping, anyway, being a Knicks fan, that was just a fluke.  Uh, let's go to Barbara. 
[01:19:30]  She's Asian.  Barbara.  And she likes ice cream.  Barbara.  Barbara.  You're perfect right now.  Yeah, and I'm not going to have the phony Asian accent.  Can you hear me?  Yeah.  Thanks, guys.  As a matter of fact, the only two men...  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Did you hear me?  Yes.  No, we didn't hear you.  Not a word. 
[01:20:00]  I said the only two men that I would have in my mouth at the same time would be Ben and Jerry.  Ooh.  All right, a fat pig?  Yeah.  Call me a chunk, all right?  How much do you want?  Are you a big gal?  No, I'm not, actually.  So how do...  I actually fit the Asian stereotype, and I get, like, these guys that want to date me simply because I'm Asian.  They think I do freaky shit.  Wait, are you 100% Asian?  Um, Japanese.  Yep.  Japanese.  Now, do you meet a lot of white guys that have Asian effects?  Because I know a lot of guys...  I've never fetishized by, like, ethnicity, but you meet that, right? 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, totally.  And what is the deal with it?  What is it the guys like where they require Asian women?  I don't know.  Um, it really depends.  Like, but as soon as I smell that out, I'm like, all right, get away from me.  You hate it, right?  It's annoying.  Yeah, it's a stereotype.  It's like, you know, it's like, oh, boy, here we go.  He's going to think I'm, you know, oh, you're a harmonica player.  Okay.  Do they expect you to be dominant or submissive or kinky, or how do they expect you to be?  Like, anyone with an Asian fetish, what do they expect from you? 
[01:21:00]  They expect that I'm crazy.  Okay.  They expect that I'm crazy, and they expect that I'm into, like, the freaky shit, that  I'm going to do, like, a Chinese backflip onto their dick, and...  Oh, really?  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm sure they expect a good handy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The kind of porn he watches.  Now, what are you...  Do you like any of those things that are stereotypical Asian, or what you think they want? 
[01:21:30]  Um...  Is that a yes?  Uh, well, it depends.  It depends, because every guy is different.  Every relationship is different.  Okay.  Some guys you want to do the freaky shit with, and some guys are just like, eh, you know,  whatever.  Oh.  What's the freaky shit, though?  Wouldn't you like to know?  Yes, I would.  Well, what the hell?  No one knows yet.  I just asked.  I would like to know.  I was just asking.  Just asking.  Yeah, you can ask.  What's the freaky shit you like? 
[01:22:00]  Well, it depends.  Every relationship is different.  I mean, what you think is freaky with one person may not be freaky to the next one.  What do you consider freaky?  Because you're the one talking that the guys always expect some kind of freaky thing.  What do you consider a little freaky?  Like all your holes filled with cum?  Well, it depends on what they ask you.  Oh, my God.  Stop being vague and answer the question.  Please.  Oh, God.  No one knows you.  Who cares?  I had this one guy, just because I'm Asian, thought I would be into, like, the whole,  like, species play. 
[01:22:30]  Oh.  He wanted to be.  No, listen.  This freaked me out.  He wanted to get on.  He had a glass coffee table.  Ah.  He wanted to lay under the coffee table, and he wanted me to, like, take a, you know,  take a dump on the coffee table on top of him.  On the floor.  Ah.  Ancient Chinese secret.  That's fucked up, man.  Thank God it was a glass coffee table.  Imagine if it was a wood coffee table. 
[01:23:00]  That would just be creepy.  So what happened?  Did you say no?  Otherwise, I'd break the coffee table, kill him, and then I'd be able to homicide him.  Are your dumps watery?  Is that why you didn't want to, because it was embarrassing?  It would look like something out of the Wonka's factory.  She was mad because her shit is watery.  Watery.  It would run off the edges of the table.  Into the rug.  Like, spilled coffee.  So did you do it for the guy?  You know, he was really handsome and smart, and I liked him, so I bought some, like, Metamucil, 
[01:23:30]  but I couldn't do it.  Metamucil.  Do you know what that would have done to your shit?  That would have destroyed everything.  That's what he wanted.  Oh, he wanted a mess?  This guy was great.  No, that makes it soft serve, doesn't it?  Oh, and then, that's not it.  I met this other guy.  Now, he's an Italian.  Okay.  Yes.  And he wanted, he wanted, he wanted, God, we were dating for, like, 10 months, and then  he said, I want to become vulnerable with you, and I'm thinking, oh, cool, some, like, emotional 
[01:24:00]  intimacy.  That's great.  And he's like, I have something in the closet, and I'm like, oh, my God, here we go.  And he tells me he wants to put on, he has adult diapers in his closet.  Jesus.  He wanted to put them on, and he wanted me to hold him and breastfeed him while he shit  in his diaper.  Oh, my God.  And I'm like, are there Asian chicks out there?  No, I want to hear from other Asian girls if there are other girls.  Did you say Asian? 
[01:24:30]  He wanted to get this kind of free.  Hey, I want to, I want to put on a diaper, and then I want you to fucking, like, rock  me.  I'll suck your tit, and I'm going to shit myself.  All right.  Why are the, why are the, why?  He wanted me to clean it.  Oh, she wanted me to clean it.  He wanted me to clean it.  Okay, of course you did.  Why are all the weirdos attracted to you?  Yeah.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I think it's because I'm Asian.  He wanted you to clean his dude?  He wanted me to take, like, the baby wipes out and, like, I don't know. 
[01:25:00]  I basically treated him like a 37-year-old infant.  Ew.  That's.  Yeah.  What a dick.  What a dick that guy is.  Clean my poop.  Looking at him, you would never think he was into that crap, and I spent 10 months with  this guy.  That means you did it.  All of a sudden, he comes out with this, and I'm like, what is this?  Miss, looking at any adult, you wouldn't expect that.  Looking at any 37-year-old, you wouldn't expect that.  I bet he likes to suck tits and shit his diapers. 
[01:25:30]  Yeah.  Uh-oh.  They're calling you the Asian Tucker Max.  Are you sure this happened?  Oh, and then everybody started puking.  Yeah.  And then the midget fell out of the fucking ceiling fan.  I'm sure he did.  Camera fell and broke.  The bread fell out of the closet, breaking the camera.  The tape fell out, and that's why I have no proof this actually happened.  Yeah, it broke.  Everybody puked.  The midget came in.  Wow.  What?  Wild frat boy.  Right.  Yuck.  But my publisher's going to believe it.  Yeah.  It allowed me to write a book.  Nothing I hate more than a wild frat boy. 
[01:26:00]  Whoa.  He's got some frat boy stories.  Puking, drinking, and toasting, and chicks.  Wild frat boy.  Go fuck yourself.  Fucking Tucker Max.  Shut up.  We weren't buying your shit.  Maybe everyone else was.  Hey, Barbara, did you allow the guy to put the diaper on?  Oh, God.  This broad won't shut up.  Oh, that's right, because I'm Asian.  Oh.  So did you allow him to put the diaper on? 
[01:26:30]  No.  No, I laughed.  I was like, oh, my God.  You've got to be kidding me.  Yeah.  Did you say diaper or dieter?  Another thing they think I'm into because I'm Asian is the golden, the whole double hat.  The whole what?  The golden shower, the double happiness golden shower.  Oh.  I ordered from that place, the golden shower.  It's right down the street from me.  Yeah, yeah.  Great Moogoo guy pan.  Nice.  Yellow.  Oh, God.  Yellow.  Did you do any toilet stuff at all? 
[01:27:00]  Toilet stuff?  Yes.  Yes, that's what you're talking about.  Miss, this whole call has been how people want your piss and shit like it's Yuli's gold.  You know, I wish I could sell it then.  Doesn't say much for your face if all they want is the bottom half of you.  Yeah.  Are you pretty?  Yeah.  Okay.  Can we Facebook you?  You can Facebook me.  All right.  Let's see if she's pretty.  But I'm not going to say it on the air.  No shit, Sherlock.  We'll figure it out. 
[01:27:30]  Hold on a minute.  Someone's going to pick you up and you give them your Facebook.  Yeah, we'll do it off air.  All right.  Hold on a sec.  Do you like Barbara?  Yes.  She's really.  She's all.  At least she's.  I love hearing stuff like that.  Like what kind of fucking creepy shit.  Oh, yeah.  Guys come.  Guys come up with you.  Women will tell you stuff that they didn't do.  Like they don't want to talk about stuff they did that's really embarrassing.  But they'll tell you stuff that guys have asked them for.  Yeah.  Realize how fucking ghoulish guys are.  Yeah. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  Wants to shit on the table.  What is that?  Would you.  Would you.  I'm not talking would you get off on it.  But would you do it just for the goof to laugh?  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  For the goof, obviously.  But.  So you get under the table.  But for some ridiculous like get turned on by a hell fucking no.  Yeah.  Dude, I took a shit in Bob Kelly's room in his garbage can.  That's awesome.  Can we have glass coffee table day? 
[01:28:30]  That would be great.  Can we do this, Sam?  We got to ramp up this show.  We got a biohazard team standing by, right?  Let's ramp up this show.  We need a glass table and a few broads that are willing to do it.  So we could do it as a goof.  And see what this is all about.  Can we get girls that are willing to shit?  What do you say?  I think technically, even though it's a solid, it would probably go under the bodily fluid category.  Yeah, but that's too bad.  But what if we go through all the precautions?  Right. 
[01:29:00]  Hazmat.  Right.  The whole thing taken care of.  You know what?  I'm going to run that up the flagpole.  Please do, Sam.  Please do.  See who salutes.  Because we want to see what all the rage is about here.  I want to see what that looks like.  Yeah.  And does the girl squat over the table so it falls on it?  Or does she sit on it and let it squish out?  I guess.  I don't know.  Because I would be up for the squish.  I would imagine she drops them from above.  I'd be up for the squish out.  I want to see that.  Well, we could try a few different ways. 
[01:29:30]  Just watch that asshole start to go, blip, blip, blip, blip, pucker.  And it's moving, blip, blip, blip, ready to erupt.  And then, wah, it just gets bigger.  And then, pfft.  Like it's singing opera?  Yeah.  Whoa.  Yeah.  And it just smashes on the table.  What would you say?  What would you say?  What would you say if it was coming out of the...  Oh.  So, isn't this right? 
[01:30:00]  They're calling you Rocker Rex.  Barbara.  What is that?  Yeah.  What's going on in the background?  She didn't give the Facebook information.  Did she?  She didn't give the Facebook information?  No, she's being difficult.  She won't give it to us.  What is wrong with you, Barbara?  We're not going to give it out on the air, Barbara.  We can't do it.  Barbara.  If you say don't give it out on the air, we can't.  That would be a problem for us.  Why wouldn't you give us the Facebook page?  No.  Hello?  Yeah.  But you said you would.  So, why didn't you say no when we asked? 
[01:30:30]  I'm a crazy, crazy Asian chick.  I've changed my mind.  But why don't you want us to have it?  We're not going to give it out on the radio.  And what was the blunder thing in the background?  What?  Oh, no.  I'm talking to you from my laptop because I'm an Asian and I can't do without my electronics.  Are you making a shit?  Who hit that sound effect?  Oh.  Are you making a shit shake for your next boyfriend who wants to wear diapers?  Yeah.  That's exactly it.  No, I'm making a Ben and Jerry shake.  I hate this brother. 
[01:31:00]  Ben and Jerry.  Why is she still on?  She changed their mind.  Yeah.  She's scary.  All right.  You changed your mind about the Facebook thing, huh?  I did.  I, I, I can't, you know what?  The, the guy that, the diaper guy and coffee table guy, you know, I'm kind of friends with  them on Facebook and it's like, I, I, you know.  We're not allowed to give out your page.  We just want to see what you look like.  I, guys, you made that abundantly clear.  You're not going to give out my page.  All right, Barbara.  Enjoy your day.  All right.  Anything else? 
[01:31:30]  In closing, anything?  Nope.  All right.  Bye, Barbara.  There goes Barbara.  Bye.  There she goes.  Yeah.  She wants to stay Barbara.  Barbara.  Barbara.  Take care.  Barb.  Yeah.  I think, you know, people are mad when they say your name too harshly.  Thanks for calling Barb.  Yeah.  That didn't sound nice.  You weren't really thankful for her call.  Yeah.  No, no, no.  Love to hear from you again.  Barb.  So we're going to have coffee table day.  Glass coffee table day. 
[01:32:00]  Sure.  How are you going to approach this, Sam?  When you go to the guys down the hall.  This would have been a no-brainer at any W.  We would have got this done on regular radio.  Well, I have to tell them that we're perfectly willing to make sure there's biohazard equipment  and crew here.  Yeah.  None of us wants to touch this shit.  Medically, everyone is cleared.  Releases are signed.  All the participants are willing.  Volunteers.  Let me tell you something.  I watched that Horda show, right? 
[01:32:30]  Yeah.  And every week, there's a crazy horde of people that have been shitting in toilets without running  water for years.  And that bathroom is full of human shit.  Right.  And they get the hazmat guys in there, and they're filming it for TV, and this guy's  handling human shit.  Now, what's the difference?  It's a great question.  Present them with that example.  Holla.  That's a good example.  Holla.  That's right.  They are handling it, and it is on TV.  I see them chuck bags of shit upstairs. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah.  Holla.  They're called management.  See, bags of shit are upstairs.  Is Gary here?  I mean, I don't know if he's here yet.  Yeah.  Why would he be here?  I don't know for sure.  It's nice to see him win an Oscar last night.  Why are we the only ones that work here?  I don't understand why we're the only ones that work here.  I don't know.  You know Howard's off again today?  Yes.  Yes, I'm obsessed by it.  Yes.  I never think of when he's honest.  I'm obsessed by it, because they pay him a shitload of money. 
[01:33:30]  He doesn't even do shows anymore.  Good for his agent.  We need an agent like that.  Yes, I'm obsessed.  We need an agent like that.  Holy fuck.  That means he's going to do two days this week.  Oh, God.  How the fuck we get that deal?  He's got another job.  We get another agent.  I want that.  Yeah, who wants to be my agent?  Let's do this today.  Or we have something to push back against so they think that we can walk.  Who wants to be my agent?  I'll do it.  You want to do it, Sam?  Yep.  Couldn't be any worse.  Sam is our agent.  I'll do it.  Can I be your agent too, Ant?  It's terrible.  So far, Sam is my new agent. 
[01:34:00]  If someone better comes along, though, I've got to fucking push you out.  I'm officially looking for a new agent.  Someone has to say it.  Fuck it.  Because I can't have this deal fucked up in October.  Am I getting it?  What type of percent am I getting?  I'll give you a two.  Two?  I thought it was like 10 to 15.  Who are your other clients?  I'm trying to get Ant, but he said no.  So you have no other clients.  I'll give you 2%.  Fuck.  What am I going to say?  No.  You're just learning the biz.  Who wants to be my agent?  You know how to get a hold of me. 
[01:34:30]  Fuck.  Hmm.  Because I can't stand for this anymore.  I want to work, like, as little as possible and get a shitload of money like I have.  Yes, I'm jealous.  Absolutely.  I'll present that offer.  Put it out on Twitter.  I'm absolutely jealous.  Is that how you're going to put out the offer?  Yes.  I hope he would like a shitload of money and would like to do very little work.  You could present that to the company, right?  I will do that.  Good starting point.  So I don't say shitload.  It sounds amateurish.  Oh.  He said he would like a substantial amount of money to do a minimal amount of work. 
[01:35:00]  Okay.  That's a good starting point.  It really is.  My client.  And I'll refer to him as my client.  A client who is of certain value to your company.  We would expect you to acquiesce to his wishes.  Yes.  Okay.  Of a substantial amount of money for a minimal amount of work and then put slash effort.  Yes.  And when he is here, he won't be working very hard.  No, no, no. 
[01:35:30]  Acquiesce.  Even the hardcore Howard people are having a real tough time defending him lately.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  They're like, fuck, give us something that we can defend at this point.  He's a busy man.  He's got another job.  Why can't we get another job?  Not allowed.  But we're not allowed.  No, we're not allowed.  We're not allowed.  You want me to make it so you are allowed?  Yes, please.  Yes.  You're officially my agent until someone better comes along.  Sam.  That's the next person through the door. 
[01:36:00]  Four more jobs.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, please.  So therefore, you have something to push back against.  Because the only thing that moves this company is something to, it's like when you're playing handball.  Oh.  If the ball comes, you have resistance, makes the game a little better.  Yes.  If you're just playing in a field.  That's silly.  It's not good because you hit the ball and it's just, you know it's got nowhere to go.  It's not coming back.  We're going to acquiesce to these demands.  Let's hope so.  People are worried that the Asian groups are going to write about us today. 
[01:36:30]  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  They don't listen.  Yeah, they don't listen.  We're fine.  We can fucking make fun all we want.  Yeah.  The Asian groups are no different than any other groups.  And they should not be above being made fun of any more than any other group in this country should be.  Stop trying to separate yourself and break yourself down.  You know, people love when their ethnicity is isolated by themselves for praise and for reverence. 
[01:37:00]  Right.  And for quote unquote celebration.  But if you point it out in humor, you're a blankophobe or a blankist.  Yeah.  And it's a lie.  It's an absolute lie.  That's the world we live in, Jimmy.  And it's based on religion.  It's not just race.  It's all of it.  Gender, sexual preference, sexual orientation.  It's all broken down into subcategories.  But if you make fun of it, don't point out that we're in a subcategory.  You're 100% right.  We're going to break because I guess Sean William Scott's going to be by in a few minutes. 
[01:37:30]  Promoting Goon on demand now.  And it just so happens a bunch of people were tweeting me over the weekend saying this movie is really funny because they know I like hockey.  It's a hockey movie.  It's a hockey movie.  It's on demand now in theaters March 30th.  So they are going to throw it in some theaters.  That's cool.  They usually do that just so it gets that, hey, it was in the theaters so they could get all the awards.  Really?  Yeah.  It's got to be in the theaters.  But it's a comedy.  They don't get awards usually.  Well, that's true.  Usually, anyway.  And we got to get to this story.  A man banned from high school games after admitting he masturbates the homemade video of girls playing basketball. 
[01:38:00]  Right.  And we got to get some vacation stories from Anthony sometime today.  Well, it's similar to that story.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Since you're out of high school.  The little wading pool.  Awful.  Awful.  Oh.  Oh, to break as he's.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  To break, we got Patrice doing that Asian thing I referenced.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This thing is fucking terrific.  Check this out.  And we got Sean William Scott next.  Chinese restaurant I go to almost twice a week.  I only go there to eat.  They won't give me a fortune cookie.  They don't know my name.  They mispronounce it.  The fucking girl calls me O'Neal.  Right?  It says Patrice.  She goes, oh, O'Neal.  Seinfeld?  Yeah.  Party of four?  Dude. 
[01:39:00]  You know.  I try.  I'm telling you.  I try to make my own Chinese food anytime I can get a chance.  It's impossible.  If I figure it out, it's going to.  I'll never go back again.  You need that headache spice.  Whatever that fucking thing is.  MSG, nigga.  Trust me.  You got to figure out that MSG shit.  Without MSG, you're not going to make delicious Chinese food.  No.  It's a fucking hallucinogen.  No, you need that.  When you go to a Chinese restaurant twice a week, they look at you where they almost know you.  You get that almost.  Where you have to remind them who you are. 
[01:39:30]  Like, you know.  Hello.  One waiter shakes my hand like he knows me.  He sort of thinks he knows you.  And he doesn't understand why.  And you have to go, well, because I'm here all the time, asshole.  The little girl behind that takes the orders, if I come pick it, she won't know me.  While I'm waiting, can I have a glass of half, you know, half order, half cranberry?  They get it.  They put the $4.50.  They put it right on your takeout bill.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Chinese people know nothing about loyalty, man.  Like, a little, you know, give and take. 
[01:40:00]  But they're not even aware, though, I'm thinking.  No.  I don't think it's malicious.  Like the Jew that we talked about.  They're aware.  If they're going to be cheap, they're aware they're being cheap to you.  The Asians, I don't think, or the Chinese people, I don't think they're even aware of what they're doing.  I think you might be right because Jews have a negotiation cheap.  They're just going to try to get what they do.  You know, you go back and forth and whatever.  Negotiators.  Chinese people have a, it's an ingrain because I think a penny here or there means nothing to them. 
[01:40:30]  I think, here's what they are.  Tremendous service.  I'm telling you, the guy that cleans my fish tank, dude, fucking meticulous cocksucker, man.  Lifts shit by itself, does a fucking phenomenal job, but will not be human with me.  I try to make him, I've been trying to make him human for five years. 
[01:41:00]  Wow.  He won't be human with me.  He gets, what is that about?  And he won't, I go, look, after five years, I know a little bit about fish.  I go, this guy, something's wrong with this thing.  It's not growing.  And I think it might not be a male.  Oh no.  I think what happened was, um, at the pet stop, um, they didn't feed him.  So niggas stop.  Like, and then he'll go, he'll do a, he, he'll do a, I know that you're trying to be funny laugh to me. 
[01:41:30]  Like, he knows that I'm trying to be charming, so he goes, to, to try to go with it.  Acknowledge it, but not, he's not affected by it.  But it's not, he's not able to be human.  It's something about what they do to them.  I don't, I don't get it.  The Opie and Anthony Show, Sirius XM.  Traveling around New York City can be quite an overwhelming experience.

And if they want to get out of the car.  What is your problem?  Kick the fucking door right into them.  Right into them.  Then you drive away and go, ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.  Told him.  It's the Anthony Cumia guide to psychotic city driving.  Ah, you cocksucker.  Available at toll plazas everywhere.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM. 
[01:43:00]  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  We got Sean William Scott outside the studio.  He's just kind of socializing.  Chatting's a nice guy.  He's chatting.  He's just such a nice guy.  Roland's bringing him in. 
[01:43:30]  Roland.  Sean William Scott.  There he is.  It's been way too long, sir.  What's up, man?  How are you?  How much, man?  I want to know.  Yes.  What?  Nice beard, man.  Oh, thanks.  You know, the sad thing is I have way more grin than you.  Well, I'm also 10 years older, so.  There's ways.  You're 10 years older than me?  Are you crazy?  Could be.  How are you guys doing?  We're doing good, man.  It's been a while.  I want to know what weird shit has been going on.  As you guys always fill me in on the weird videos, like I'm searching YouTube, but I think  I've exhausted all my, like, fat people falling, old people falling videos. 
[01:44:00]  Unfortunately, we've been kind of shut down.  We just talk now.  Well, there are videos, you know.  Yeah, there's videos.  We make videos here and there.  But as far as the live stuff going down in the studio, we'd like a lot more.  As a matter of fact, just earlier, we brought up the fact that we would like to have a girl  come in and do that old school shitting on the coffee table, the glass coffee table thing.  Because people asked us today if we would do that. 
[01:44:30]  And I said yes for the goof, not to be turned on by it.  But so then we're trying to get this whole glass coffee table day together.  Wait, just to have a girl come in and shit in a coffee table?  Well, you hear the stories every once in a while where guys...  I've never heard that.  You've never heard it?  I've never heard that one?  I mean, like, the two girls in a cup thing.  But, like, just coming in, like, hey, how you doing?  Sylvester Stallone, supposedly.  I've heard Chuck Berry.  I've heard Chuck Berry.  See, they'd go under the table, and then you're looking through the glass table, and the  girl gets on top of the table and squats and lets one go on the table, and you get 
[01:45:00]  to see the whole process. </pre>
