<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with a deep dive into the George Washington Bridge lane closure scandal involving Chris Christie.  The hosts dissected emails, news reports, and speculated on Christie’s culpability and the potential legal ramifications.  Their analysis was punctuated by humorous commentary on the email wording and the media’s response.  The conversation then meandered through a variety of topics, including their opinions on Jesse Jackson, Charles Barkley, and Dennis Rodman; personal traffic anecdotes; the movie *Bad Grandpa*; Led Zeppelin; Joan Baez; and a listener call about a traffic incident.  Guest Joel McHale from *The Soup* joined the discussion, contributing his experiences and opinions, including a detailed recounting of his Thanksgiving trip to Paris.  Another listener called in about a Jimmy Page side project.

Next, actor Joe Michaili from *Community* joined the show.  The conversation focused on *Community*'s fifth season, syndication difficulties, and Michaili's experiences, including Chevy Chase's departure.  Discussions also included Louis C.K., a bizarre "ass crack bandit" school incident, and the new talk show *Search*.  A substantial portion was dedicated to Dennis Rodman's North Korea trip, his birthday serenade for Kim Jong-un, and the reactions of Jesse Jackson and others.  The Impractical Jokers segment followed, highlighted by Jimmy Norton's particularly pungent flatulence. The segment concluded with promotional announcements for Michaili's show and Norton's stand-up.  The humor throughout this segment was largely crude and offensive.

The final segment focused on the hosts' experiences with stunts on their *Impractical Jokers* TV show. They detailed a 27-minute underwater stunt during a live magic show, a dentist office prank, and a forced skydive from 15,000 feet.  They discussed upcoming stunt ideas, ranging from relatively harmless to extremely dangerous and offensive.  A significant portion was dedicated to a video of "living dolls"—men in hyperrealistic female rubber suits—provoking discussions of the practice’s motivations and social reactions.  The conversation also touched upon the removal of the Chief Wahoo logo and the Pittsburgh Pirates' logo change.  Finally, they briefly showed a video of a young child using extremely profane language, contrasting it with a heartwarming video of a child singing Elvis.  The show concluded with the hosts expressing their exhaustion.

[00:02:30]  people that like um uh you know you should talk about uh weed and you know a lot of the the mma guys  smoke it and it makes you uh fast it keeps you fast and something like i'm like really then maybe it  was just me and everyone i knew that had fucking slowed down it's like no that was the old weed you  was smoking so now like everyone these guys are piling on saying like no the new weed it doesn't 
[00:03:00]  slow you down at all nice doesn't do anything like that like oh really i'm gonna have to take a look at  that yeah i don't think so uh no dennis rodman's the other idiot in the news yeah and then uh i gotta  say governor christie is a big fat idiot oh boy this fucking guy had a very very very good shot at  the white house and and now he has this ridiculous bridge scandal little scandal and uh i don't i don't 
[00:03:30]  know i mean you know your your basic news channels are being very uh very careful with this yeah i don't  i guess they have to be well but governor christie knew period there's a lot of speculation but then  they're not saying that officially yet on cnn fox msnbc whatever news uh channel you know you uh you watch  yeah well this guy this guy knew i mean there's emails that are so close to to governor christie  yeah it's like one degree of separation away he uh he decided uh well well someone on this is where we 
[00:04:00]  are right now right uh somebody very close to him and his inner circle a direct appointee to him  decided because the um fort lee uh mayor i guess it was right the mayor who's a democrat democrat  christie obviously a republican he didn't um give an endorsement to christie during the last governor  uh election the election where governor christie was kicking the ass of everybody right right it wasn't 
[00:04:30]  even close so it didn't even matter so this guy decides he's gonna get in touch with the  another guy another christie appointee right that he knows who are about authority sorry who are  pretty much high school friends right right yeah yeah yeah or that close to governor christie  so he sends him an email yeah over to this other appointee of christie who's head of uh  the uh port authority he's involved in the port authority and um he says uh hey make some traffic  over there in fort lee hey fuck it up like you said like it's an online game it's like it's sim city 
[00:05:00]  or something it's like your opponent was against you do you want to you know bribe him this or close  off traffic to his town oh close off traffic me a bunch of exclamation points over the cars right  they're all getting heated they're all angry peeing in their cars yes yes oh i wonder how many people  had to pee in their cars because uh what governor christie allegedly did because of a little vendetta  so now at the very least by the way this all started in september i want people you know we've 
[00:05:30]  been hearing these uh rumblings since september in this area uh-huh and uh then it all came to a  head yesterday because these emails uh surfaced uh-huh uh connecting in the world uh-huh  busiest bridge in the world yeah wow yeah and the one thing about this area we all take our  fucking traffic extremely seriously we deal with it every day it drives us insane we see lane closures  that go nowhere and we always wonder why was that lane closed yeah so it seems like this shit has been 
[00:06:00]  going on forever as a little vendetta a little thing you could do to get back at people when i get when i  get out of the midtown tunnel there's one of those light up signs you know and it says uh however many  minutes to the grand central parkway right and usually it says eight minutes right if i see it  says 14 minutes right i'm like oh motherfucker of course because i know i'm going to be sitting now  eight to 14 minutes it's not really that bad but you know it's just going to be sitting right in 
[00:06:30]  fucking traffic right and then you got to figure out why there was traffic and it's usually a dumb  fuck reason but it's six minutes there and then it's a broken corner over here for another four  minutes and then they close a bunch of the toll lanes and then it's another five minutes there it  adds up so when these working people on the gwb find out that politicians right and their cronies  closed uh toll lanes and and put you in traffic for no reason other than a vendetta to get back at 
[00:07:00]  somebody that is a big thing very big thing this shit still goes on huh who knew there's an email in  here yeah one of them said uh there's an email time for some traffic in fort lee that's the email  right i think time for some traffic in fort lee yeah i think it was i think it's that guy wilstein  who's his friend writes back um got it got it well now let's wait until we can interpret this um  very vague email exchange time for some traffic traffic why wouldn't you why wouldn't you write it 
[00:07:30]  better like exactly you know i really think we need to do a traffic study because that's that's  one of the excuses they're using but it's not really well why wouldn't you just say it that way  in the emails yeah yeah knowing that's that a lot of emails just don't go away yeah exactly i was  telling ann in the old days it was an inbox like you know here's the inbox and you see time for some  traffic and then you write back got it but then those inbox fucking uh you know messages go into a 
[00:08:00]  shredder or something how about you just email office somewhere and go right hey here's what  the deal is you know that thing yeah yeah you know that guy lee we going to jersey no  nice work christy that's why sonny got shot in the car because there's traffic there's a road rage  incident you know that guy lee you know yeah you're talking code we all know that exactly it's uh 
[00:08:30]  but governor christy uh put out a statement yesterday he's outraged he's gonna get to the  bottom of that type of shit well he was goofing on it um since september yeah he has downplaying  it kind of yelling at reporters kinda he was saying um he was on some of the talk shows saying uh  things like uh oh yeah i was out there in my orange vest putting the cones out myself right like this  is ridiculous that i'd be involved in in in this what's uh very interesting is governor christy is  a guy that gets front and center all the time oh yeah and he just wrote a little statement threw it 
[00:09:00]  to the press yesterday and then he has been very very quiet since he owns problems yeah kind of has  kind of disappeared he canceled uh one of his uh meetings yesterday one of his uh appearances or  whatever it was and uh just the other day he uh all of a sudden they had this ceremonial um dream act  signing he had signed it uh into law a while ago what's the dream act it's uh immigrant children of  immigrants can get to scholarships in jersey and um you know it's very democratic friendly sure 
[00:09:30]  uh legislation of course and uh it it's very suspect that he decided just the other day  to have this ceremonial signing where a bunch of people are around and clapping for him and uh you  could be led to believe that that was perhaps to take some of the heat off of him from these democrats  that would you know throw him under the bus right saying well you know we were just clapping for him  the other day man he's in deep shit period well at the very least he he has appointed people that are 
[00:10:00]  not good people to have around him that's the very least at this point at this point i think it goes  further it's what we know is he um i think this gets really ugly you could bash him by saying well  what kind of response but then again you could bash obama for the same thing um every politician  oh you know but uh at if it goes further yeah we'll get into more details but christie on the  phone uh it's bird man oh bird man what do you what do you think that fat motherfucker had nothing 
[00:10:30]  to do with it dude he's been in the booth all morning oh jesus it's e-rock wait no it's not  i can speak for myself i i believe he has a lot to do with this uh-huh i think he has everything to  do with this this might not be such this might be such a no big deal to these guys he probably does  but it may be one of those things like hey we caused a little traffic like they may have been  doing this so much it may be such a thing that they even don't even real is not a thought right 
[00:11:00]  right i now believe that this has been something they've been doing forever yeah business as usual  because i know we've all said it why is this lane closed because you're traffic traffic forever an  extra 20 minutes and then you get to where there was supposed to be something and there's  nothing what's that about moving what the fuck is that what is that yeah is that a vendetta i don't  know perhaps uh oh how about fucking uh how about rolling construction rolling i think rolling 
[00:11:30]  construction is only about vendettas i don't think they ever do anything oh man you can't get around  them a politician just saying it's right there let's roll some shit out get the fucking we're gonna  roll from exit 8 to exit 15 i want fucking three abreast orange trucks right doing 20 miles an hour  i want one crew putting the cones down and one crew picking them up right after  i hate rolling construction um well here's more details during the bridge incident which i think 
[00:12:00]  snarled traffic uh backing it up all over fort lee and surrounding and other surrounding towns in  area four days four straight days for instead of having just slight traffic at the bridge at that  time it was hours people were stuck in traffic for hours and they're saying that four ambulance calls  were delayed and one resulted in a woman's death they're saying and it disrupted the search for a  missing four-year-old right i mean it probably just delayed a little bit that's what they're saying 
[00:12:30]  thank god for that oh yeah to get her out of the van  what were some of that stuff you're reading right before the show jimmy these were emails  that are i guess boy magazine yes i was i was looking at kufus and gallant not decide which one  i'd fuck remember remember it's a text exchange between two unidentified christy appointees and it  showed the calloused chatters talking great delight in the four days of gridlock one of them said is it 
[00:13:00]  wrong that i'm smiling and another one's like i feel bad about the kids oh god and then another  one they are the children of blono voters yeah um i guess there was a lot of problems with kids um  not not going to school not going to school uh yeah first day of school which is usually a biggie  for for parents parents that were trying to get their kids to school yeah it was just a clusterfuck  uh and and a lot of like commerce was interfered with a lot of uh trucking going over the bridge 
[00:13:30]  you know that's a huge thoroughfare for uh commerce between uh jersey and new york there are lawsuits  that are gonna fucking pile up look at this uh richie in new york city go ahead  yeah good morning boys hey buddy i don't know if you guys realize how bad this fucked up the traffic  it fucked up the traffic not only did he do it going south but at one point they all saw a following  day the traffic he did it going into new jersey so the traffic one day was backed up so bad 
[00:14:00]  it was backed up down to 57 street where you get onto the west side highway yeah wow why would you do  it that way though if you're trying to fuck over the guy in fort lee i actually know that's uh  about um seven seven to seven and a half miles to the bridge yeah bumper to bumper i don't know  why you'd do it that way though it doesn't make sense you're trying to fuck over the guy in fort  lee maybe that's another issue because i'm not sure if that's coming out that he uh yeah those you know  that it was blocked uh that way as well yeah this was to to screw up fort lee right and it's people 
[00:14:30]  who've sat in traffic for hours for meaningless reasons like i think that they should find out who did  this and execute them yes on the bridge or hang them on the bridge oh like old school throw them  off like they thought michael rapaport jumped yeah and that's the movie right that was a christy plan  yeah i guess you got to do the ifs and the alleged and all that shit but if governor christy ordered  this like you were saying earlier it's like he's trying to be tony soprano it's mob tactics it's it's 
[00:15:00]  old school like crony mob tactics tactics right yeah it's a very difficult situation  close that fucking bridge  it really is it's like that is old school like boss hog shit well you you think it's old school but i i'm  i i'm assuming that this shit has just always been going on these little things that you could do to  you know piss off your uh your your your political uh fucking you know opponents hey t i blocked the 
[00:15:30]  bridge t i love that guy yeah this is uh he could be fucked in this one if especially if he goes any  further and this is death and oh that's bad yeah they were hit they were hinting on uh one of the  channels last night um that you know criminal charges possibly for people so so so fucking with the  911 responders or whatever maybe that's what it is right they said the ambulance is driving on the 
[00:16:00]  sidewalks just trying to get to where they had to be yeah fucking over your constituency like that  yeah fucking over nothing more than i'm insulted that this guy didn't fucking endorse me that takes  big balls oh they're using the word uh bully yeah we uh we all don't bully we all don't like bullies  these days and and and you're like you said he's you know if if if you were this he's he's pissing off  his own people and these are working people fucking people that go to school this is like the salt of 
[00:16:30]  the earth you know yeah it was not just you know oh well we don't care about them they're republicans  got affected as well yeah although you could take the republican lane i know they opened up one that  was like the easy pass smooth sailing nice it's a big r on it and if you have to be honest and stay in  the proper lane that midtown tunnel i don't know what kind of scam they're pulling over there but uh  there's traffic there every day yesterday oh my god yeah but it's always for no reason i go through  there they stop traffic right and i swear this guy was it looked like he was trying to set a record 
[00:17:00]  how slowly can i cross this little fucking lane of the toll plaza  they don't understand people that like in a rush trying to get to work if you got all those toll  lanes they should be open at all fucking every lane should be opened for every fucking hour of  the day period you're trying to tell us that we don't pay enough fucking money to keep all the lanes 
[00:17:30]  open right well son because i hate when you you come in at an early hour like this yeah and you're like  oh fuck obviously i'm gonna have no fucking traffic this is rules and then you get to the  toll plaza and they decide yeah it's like traffic so we'll only keep one fucking lane open and then  you're sitting in the tolls for 10 15 minutes there's other instances too like yesterday for  example uh they had to turn a box truck around sometimes they got to turn trucks around right  they get over there in the tunnel and the tunnel isn't supposed to take certain trucks so they got 
[00:18:00]  to turn them around now they got to stop everybody at the toll plaza spin the truck around which is  fine i understand that's going to happen it's annoying but it's going to happen but now after  they turn the truck around the guy will put his hand out and leave it like now you can go right  he'll leave it out and as he's slowly walking out of the lane he'll keep his hand out there even when  he's completely out of the way and then be like all right now come on just to fucking like it's a  power thing with them it's a power one moment of stopping right right like you feel like a king 
[00:18:30]  it's like get the my moment to feel like a king i'm backing up all this look at what i get to do  i tell you when you go job meanwhile his wife is having a fucking vagina pounded into the  into the sheets while he's at work can only hope uh pat in the bronx has something on the  on bridge gate oh bridge gate is that what they're gonna call it yeah they're already calling it no  oh i hate that gate thing just became it makes no sense i tweeted uh governor christy yesterday 
[00:19:00]  you did just a song i like and i was wondering if he liked it bridge over trouble yeah there you go  and then i just wrote what says you what says you governor christy and my other tweet to him was just  uh-oh uh-oh but pat's gonna explain this whole thing go ahead pat hey guys um my i was the  traffic the caller was calling about the stop the 57th street wasn't due to christy that day that was 
[00:19:30]  because the jackass workers who were fixing potholes ran out of asphalt so you're saying that that caller  was talking out his ass oh yes he was oh wow beautiful this is see this is working out perfectly  that's it yeah we assumed that wasn't part of the yeah why did you do that yeah they uh they did  they did about 200 potholes and only had asphalt for 100 of them so i hear you thank you pat you  want to go up to that toll plaza but a bing put your car over there 
[00:20:00]  we could set up cones we could stop traffic we got people in the mta and import authority  coming to christy has to get in front of some cameras today today oh good luck today i don't know  i think he's probably got people poking around seeing who knows what like the last thing he  wants is to be blindsided by some reporter flapping a piece of paper in his hand going going hey what  about this that says you know signed by you yeah maybe he doesn't fuck everyone on the bridge right 
[00:20:30]  maybe he doesn't know if you don't know what's out there right talk to him right small moment  you what you want to go through everything and remember remember you know do the old we want  to find out who let's find out who was uh you know do an investigation get you back in the governor's  office yeah heard that enough times on the radio of course uh i'm just uh okay this is what christy  said yesterday what i've seen today for the first time is unacceptable i'm outraged and deeply saddened 
[00:21:00]  to learn that not only was i misled by a member of my staff but this completely inappropriate and  unsanctioned conduct was made without my knowledge so that was obama saying what why would the staff do  it why would they care who endorsed him as i get that they're all together but wouldn't that be  something he would get annoyed at like the guy didn't endorse me if the guy's a complete asshole  and goes up to him later and goes hey see that traffic that was me that was me for you i did it for  you i did it for you man for you did it for you oh god are you crazy you're what what i did it for 
[00:21:30]  you it was great man we that guy didn't we no uh one thing is clear christy continues this type of  behavior is unacceptable and i will not tolerate it because the people of new jersey deserve better  this behavior is not representative of me or my administration in any way and people will be  held responsible for their actions and then he went away the people of new jersey deserve better 
[00:22:00]  like what in every other state they don't deserve better they deserve to go ladies die well we've  dealt with that right everyone thinking their state is the greatest relax people of new jersey have  resolved all right do they new jerseyans don't give up what oh god new jersey we'll get over this bridge  scandal people well there was traffic on the bridge it needs to do a benefit you i better not  fucking roland loves them bruce bruce will get out there do a benefit for everybody that had to sit in 
[00:22:30]  traffic because he's a tool meanwhile he bruce has caused more traffic with his fucking contract than  anybody wow the closures in september caused massive gridlock leaving commuters uh commuters stuck in  traffic for hours the email messages also reportedly show new jersey officials react and after the  closings were reversed the new york side gave fort lee back all three lanes this morning we are  appropriately going nuts uh will will stein reportedly wrote to kelly port authority chairman david uh 
[00:23:00]  sampson helping us to retaliate  i want no acts of traffic retaliation  gridlock ends now what do you think if i see rubbernecking  what do you think what do you think uh  did you order it that's hard to say hard to say really i can't even make man i ain't even got an 
[00:23:30]  opinion well you gotta have a motherfucking opinion i shot marvin in the face i don't know it's it's  just way too close to to christy he had to know well it is but i got we gotta say i guess we gotta say  uh it's there isn't enough out there to absolutely say whether or not a hunch um  even that i say you got to know a little more about these guys that were sending the emails back and 
[00:24:00]  forth are they one of those you know they're for you man uh i think not only do you know they went  out to dinner and talked about it you think and had a good laugh good chuckle good laugh about it  but it's like you know how the staff will fight sometimes and we have no idea what's going on oh  yeah is it one of those things where in that world that's such a common thing that you wouldn't even  tell them because that'd be like sam coming and going a rock was crankiest like he might say that but he  might not because it's such a non-issue or maybe they're just tricks dirty tricks the only other 
[00:24:30]  thing is maybe they know governor christy so well because they've been close to him for so long  they know that that he would like this to happen he'd love it right right you know what i mean he's  kind of a crazy guy a little fun right like they just know hey we'll just with you know the busiest  bridge in the world oh that guy's being an asshole all right we know we we know we got  fuck his town up we know what christy needs here dude let's just go in and fuck his town  up with cars it's unbelievable yeah it'll be hilarious john stewart had the best uh take on 
[00:25:00]  this so far oh yeah well although letterman had a hilarious did he i didn't see that one  that was really funny he was uh snorling traffic somewhere else as well i saw and they showed a  arby's drive-thru oh that's funny that was pretty funny i saw i i saw the john stewart the problem  what john stewart is if his bit is a 10 with me it automatically starts off at a five like i whack  five points off of any any funny bit for him because i i can't stand him so much you can't 
[00:25:30]  stand him anymore can't stand him you sanctimonious fuckwad thank you  and planning this over email with non-coded lingo you're gonna be ashamed of yourselves  hey why don't we create a traffic jam in fort lee as retribution you're an embarrassment to dialogue  here's how it should have gone hey did you take care of that thing yeah that thing yeah i took care  yeah a good friend lee yeah he's constipated all right yeah no no no no lee yeah a good friend lee 
[00:26:00]  he's gonna be backed up oh there you go that is funny yeah to make it so blatantly obvious and  these emails and text messages that's wow it's so it's so bad for jersey too because jersey does have  that synonymous with kind of bungling organized crime uh a la sopranos and stuff so to do something 
[00:26:30]  like this which is such a strong arm tactic uh it just again reinforces that whole jersey stereotype  the only thing we haven't discussed how did how did all this how did all these emails uh see the  don't know i don't know you cannot email anything safely you really can't they surfaced emails always  they surfaced they surfaced so it says emails surfaced oh you don't want that so there's a panicky 
[00:27:00]  piece in that office ah live from the cbs what what happened look at us what's going on something  surfacing whoa i want to hear it why what is it did sound center in new york city this is cbs  two news at 11. wow sounds important surrounding traffic gridlock at the george washington bridge  a top aid to governor christy now implicated after emails reveal a twisted plot twisted plot 
[00:27:30]  we should have used to begin tomorrow one day after these emails surfaced the cbs two is just  that's old we did all that wow we absolutely did all these dummies are still emailing  that's crazy oh my god you just can't email no it's on every channel it's everywhere um yeah  even leading to a woman's death so there will be hearings on the closures set for today  there is saying this morning you're going to want to hear that and so much more 
[00:28:00]  our two for this morning with joe johnson washington it's all over the latest well chris you know this  started out as a hometown inconvenience story on a bridge between new york and new jersey but now it's  become national news all because of the newly exposed email traffic between members of the governor's  inner circle really raising questions about abuse of power and political retribution  this morning the pressure is mounting that's not the kind of leadership that new jersey needs and 
[00:28:30]  it's certainly not the kind of leadership the nation needs the new jersey bridge emails igniting  a full-blown scandal with increasing calls for a federal investigation more than enough evidence  to bring in the feds you're going to be seeing computers leaving the office you need to know what  you never want to see feds carrying your computers that's never good with ems crews unable to reach  people in need of emergency care wednesday afternoon christy released a written statement he did not 
[00:29:00]  apologize but blamed the problems on his staff i am outraged and deeply saddened to learn that not  only i just read that by a member of my staff but this completely inappropriate and unsanctioned conduct  was made without my knowledge his administration is accused of shutting down several lanes of the  george washington bridge for four days in september causing major traffic problems in the town of  fort lee the mayor of that town had refused to endorse christie at the time christie's office denied 
[00:29:30]  any political revenge and blamed the bridge snarl on a traffic study i actually was the guy working  the cones out there you really are not serious with that question but cnn obtained texts and emails that  many say prove otherwise time for some traffic problems in fort lee that email was sent august 13th  from the account of bridget ann kelly the governor's deputy chief of staff to david wildstein one of the  governor's top appointees at the agency that controls the bridge got it he replied when the mayor of fort 
[00:30:00]  lee called about the gridlock if you send me tip picks that's what i'd say find out if anyone had called  him back radio silence was the response christie's crew wants from the station whether he was truly  ignorant of the communications of his staff they want an investigation his statements and actions thus  far uh have proven that he's not the straight shooter that he has claimed to be and uh the questions  require answers and he needs to step up and and face the music and answer those questions music 
[00:30:30]  and there are tons of questions still out there hearings today calls for an investigation the other  headache for governor christie is that he didn't know what was going on in his own office he was  misled by a member of his staff the emails seem to suggest that others including people at the port  authority may have had knowledge of what was going on kate wow thank you so much for that let's talk  more about this yes many new jersey that couldn't get their kids to school this is the mayor  i have to read this to you and get your response to it we have david wallstein who since resigned 
[00:31:00]  saying it will be a tough november for this little serbian got a response to that  david wildstein deserves an ass kicking holy there i said it yes you did governor christie who  for an investigation will you be requesting a formal investigation i will ask not only the u.s  attorney for new jersey but the southern district of new york and the manhattan d.a why why why do you 
[00:31:30]  want the investigation you don't think what you're going to hear from the governor at some point i'm  sure and what you're going to get in these hearings will be enough well there's certainly reasonable  suspicion that criminal acts uh we've actually heard that when our pictures have been up on there it's not  not fun no it is not fucking fun enjoy that uh we're looking at the criminal acts  i know why that isn't so do you let's not pretend that it's because of the gravity of the issue 
[00:32:00]  i thought i kicked all you orange cones out of here  star ledger's editorial board writes this his attempts to laugh this off now appear to be dishonest  though we can't yet be sure that he personally knew about the doings of one of his top aides either way  though christy bears responsibility if it turns out he did know he is obviously lying and unfit for  office let alone a 2016 presidential run to school that's an abuse of government no one who runs 
[00:32:30]  is lying yeah that's not politics yeah you know what i like how they are piling on this but they're not  giving they didn't give hillary and benghazi and what she knew and what uh obama knew about benghazi  any press a lot of this mainstream media it was all fox that was the only people saying anything and  to this day there's still a lot of unanswered questions about who knew what uh emails uh and  what not about benghazi and and she's obviously going to run for president um you know saddle her 
[00:33:00]  with some of this is a political bullet dead man with the wall street journal has been covering this  story it's reckless endangerment of people's lives that's for sure you don't want to hear that  okay and reckless endangerment of people's lives i believe that was wow yeah yeah whether there  was criminal those are wow that was a wow we don't know but someone died as a result of uh of an  abuse of governmental authority that certainly has to be investigated the official explanation of this  was ridiculous that there was this was not an attempt to study traffic by shutting off two lanes 
[00:33:30]  without warning anybody about it first that that made no sense um who has said uh it's all over  it's every channel talking about whatever it takes cnn fox what is fox talking about this is the world  we live in these guys haven't got off the christy thing yet and i saw fox because i want to go you  know through all the news channels yeah yeah and they mentioned as a quick little thing at the top of  the hour they moved on to obama back to obamacare and hey man whatever side you're on you gotta you gotta 
[00:34:00]  see how ridiculous this whole thing is how it's covered yeah they don't want to deal with the  government look at welfare they're talking about now hey and they're still on it on msnbc cancel msnbc  this will be the whole day of course remember now we'll say it was racist what's her name she'll  lisp over it anyway oh that's funny wow so there you go we should take our first break we got food food to 
[00:34:30]  eat what up with that yo well i'm one of the governor christy thing but i think i think we did a  pretty damn good job it was concise yes yeah we read the same statements of course we did that was  fun and we did it first and we made definitive statements on hill jackson i love sheila jackson  why would you like her funny why what's that about um i don't know she's infuriating  you don't like her oh if i was in the privacy of my own home you'd know how much i don't like her 
[00:35:00]  would you make that would you verbalize that i absolutely would i may when i go to the bathroom  we got joel mccall coming in in a little bit from the soup navy oh from the soup  and community i guess yes yes who's practical jokers oh impractical jokers yeah they're pretty  they're fans of the show and uh the show's pretty good they just do jokes the guys that get out on  the street they have hidden cameras and they uh make people do oh you know i've heard of them 
[00:35:30]  they yeah okay yeah i've watched a few episodes it's pretty good pretty funny i saw that goddamn uh  the goddamn bad grandpa it's pretty funny i am here where how do you see that okay i saw it  no the only reason i'm asking i i didn't think it's on demand no it is on demand it is yeah oh good  because i want to see that it's uh i i thought it was just going to be like a jackass kind of a  thing and right you know shit like that but it's weird they kind of tie it into a story a fictional  story but it's all the scenes are based on him with people i thought it was i felt it was all it 
[00:36:00]  looked to me like it was all faked yeah but every single even the scenes with people i thought yeah  i i i don't i don't think so i don't think it was all faked like borat yeah like the borat yes  yes whereas half and half it's a fictional story but it's not as detailed as the borat story so  you could really get away with more with with people what scene did you think wasn't faked  wasn't fake without giving away too much because i felt watching it i was like god that that whole 
[00:36:30]  a lot of these people are not in on it but enough of them probably are um when people would get  concerned about him like when when the little kid or the or the little kid like would talk to older  people like when he was talking to the guy you could hear that the guy was kind of like mic'd  like it just it was really yeah i don't know i found it funny regardless i i i you know what  it was it was good enough where i didn't give a shit if they were doing that because it was kind  of a funny uh movie anyway yeah i'm so glad he came in and uh promoted that movie on our show that 
[00:37:00]  was terrific oh that's right he did but he wasn't here what oh that's right i took pictures with him  downstairs johnny knoxville yeah the fuck is wrong some of these people well he wouldn't did he just do  howard or did he do i wouldn't even do the after show why he walked right by it why wouldn't he i  don't know we've had him on a million times like promoting really shitty movies like saying he  wouldn't even eat a hunk of sandwich i mean really let's get really fun wouldn't even do the after  show like who's who's shocked at that it's gonna send shockwaves through the entertainment industry 
[00:37:30]  there is an after show we've had him on the phone even we have oh now dennis rodman saying he  embarrassed a lot of people oh really well you know what enjoy the that you got to deal with  now we'll we'll talk about rodman next let's let's trade her yeah rumor i don't know if they ever  proved that was that other one right right because he was in a weird bad place but then the room was  he got his back together and all that but i don't know i remember that one not uptight not unattractive 
[00:38:00]  turn me on tonight because i'm a radioactive dinner the firm yes yeah the firm right yes  think of the honey drippers back in the day uh you know there was a couple songs i didn't mind  actually yeah yeah he had a pretty good resurgence in his career right there with those dumb honey  drippers absolutely and and he pulled his vocals way down because he that was a problem with him 
[00:38:30]  he can never hit the notes that he could uh that that were on zeppelin songs right he just couldn't  do it right coverdale could right so then he uh got the honey drippers and decided i don't have to  fucking do these crazy high notes anymore i don't think anyone called this out i think it was it was  coverdale uh page it was covered up page so yeah i said coverdale plant i i that was the other side  project i know it was covered so this jimmy page who i love he's a rock god  obviously plant didn't want to play anymore so he goes oh yeah look what i do i get a singer who could 
[00:39:00]  cut all the notes and he could hit all the notes and that was coverdale and they were they went out  and they absolutely did zeppelin songs and stuff yeah all right now we're getting somewhere with this  break oh i don't know about that it doesn't feel that way unless you're being sarcastic then don't i feel  stupid joan biaz were you ever a joan biaz fan joan biaz i saw joan biaz uh recently oh that  documentary when me and jimmy were spending quality time together yeah i think it was was the one on

[00:47:00]  did you know how cold it was outside for the last few days uh how cold was it well oh my  and i will say i didn't see any homeless people hardly this week yeah yeah that is cold so one good  part of the cold right yeah brilliant gets them out gets them uh did the soup do anything on the frozen  t-shirt experiment uh no we just showed that guy uh you know people throwing the uh boiling water  in the air he just dumped it all over himself yeah and screaming and yelling it was pretty great the  news has been on a tear uh when it gets cold they the new thing is you soak the t-shirt and then you 
[00:47:30]  put it on a hanger and you hang it up and then when they go to the live shot outside they're like  let me show you this t-shirt it's frozen something and they bang it on something next and then they use  words like amazing amazing meanwhile it's not amazing about it that water that would be like  opening your freezer looking at the ice cube tray going oh my god right the cold temperature made this  water solid it's like a rock it's a rock it's no longer liquid and then meanwhile back to you for 
[00:48:00]  real nice and then meanwhile i saw you know chicago they had an aerial shot and of course the lake  is frozen solid right that's pretty amazing amazing because that doesn't happen like that  gallons of water but you have to hire a helicopter to get up in the air well look at this amazing  thing happening a canoe guy on the ice well what's he doing i don't know is he saving someone  the boat that was caught in the ice remember how that was the number one story and they were like  now it's cold forget i don't care what happened we don't care because it's cold everywhere so screw 
[00:48:30]  them what ever happened to it it was freed i didn't know the story was existing until they said the  boat is now out of where was it like in the arctic somewhere yeah they got the people off it i don't  know if they've got the boat out of there very easily could be completely telling i heard there was  an australian ship right that went in there and uh they got a little crack in front of the ship and  then drove drove out but soon as it got cold here people like screw yeah screw we don't want to hear  about syria we don't want to hear about anything else but i don't think a lot of people knew the  irony the whole thing was they were on some type of a global warming um yeah expedition yeah 
[00:49:00]  to check out how globe and they're meanwhile the northeast is the whole north of the united states  is frozen and uh not anymore not anymore we're back to regular winter today our polar vortex is over  so if you as i tweeted it sounds like something that uh zan from the wonder twins would call himself  but you hear that it's like okay now that's going to be said a million times that was a word 
[00:49:30]  custom made for the news yes that is one of those it sounds very dangerous  so vortex it's very cold it sounds like the x-men that sounds like something you would make that  yes you could you could make your hand a pet what can you do well i'm wolverine i do that what do you  do i i put up polar vortexes whoa they will have that thing at the end of the near next year where  it'll be like well most popular phrase this year polar vortex who would have thought that a new phrase  added to webster's last year it was selfie you know some scientists some scientists probably said it 
[00:50:00]  very casual like that's probably a polar vortex and they're oh thank you thank you some guy  copy off a machine and just his ear went up like a dog when they hear a whistle  they run right to the graphics department to get that nice graphic  we said it first we said that first i swear to you we said it first don't say we said yeah oh they  don't even care because every uh channel's doing the t-shirt experiment how was your name

[00:57:00]  halls yeah chewy what's your what's your thoughts on uh paris do you like it i hear the people aren't  nice that's what people say they always say that no they uh compared to new yorkers they are downright  pleasant uh there's no one screaming at people that maybe that i didn't see it but if  you i was told and i think it worked uh if you attempt to speak it uh if you just go if you just  say like pardon like i'm sorry that i don't speak if you kind of can come close to that you will get 
[00:57:30]  a million you get much further as opposed to oh i would like a croissant oh no it's uh if you attend  and also if you have kids they are much more at least try are they most for the most part uh savvy  with english over there yes see that's a weird thing mostly that is an odd thing with the rest  of the world like everybody speaks whatever they speak and then you know they speak english too yeah  we're just like hey it's because it's the language of computers yeah yeah that's true that's and 
[00:58:00]  everything and airline yeah yeah language of aviation so we're good but i heard we were at uh we were  coming back from versailles thank you and uh i watched and she clearly was from new york because of her  accent but she was like i need a ticket for the train for the i want to go back to paris and the  woman you could see the woman start to go and you could i could watch this french woman started to  like her she her brow darkened yes and then the woman she the american just goes yeah well 
[00:58:30]  fuck you this was oh shit at the train station she goes ah fuck you you have a huge ass and that's  what the the attendant said and then we were next up in line we're like uh uh pardon um train ticket  too it was it was one of those moments i was like i'm embarrassed you know what i carry around you know  what i would carry on like flavor flav with the clock but it would be an eight by ten picture of the the  war dead at normandy and i would put that around my neck and any french you want to give me 
[00:59:00]  shit they could look at that the sacrifice that i personally made yeah all right well maybe not  yeah but your country exactly you should have your child bride carry that around and show it instead  of you having to carry it like i have the omaha beach uh lego set yeah but those guys they knew how to live  yeah they when they were in charge of everything they brought everything back to paris yeah and it is 
[00:59:30]  nice it's really nice yeah the city of lights right is that what they call it and the fact that the  german they surrendered oh yeah so nothing got blown up is oh that's true that kind of was a good move  knowing that later on they would get it back in hindsight also sadly sacrificed a lot of their  people because of yeah you know what people can be replaced culture paintings and buildings  and they also had this great we went to the catacombs which are oh that sounds cool it's really cool  and i was so at one point paris had a lot of graveyards and they were like enough of that 
[01:00:00]  we need all this space and so they just emptied their graveyards and put it in a hole and so there's  no graveyards around harley wow and now there's like five million people uh stuffed into these caves  what do they look like though are they like in like mausoleum type things or they just lay it is just piles of  bones that are that are there's so much that they have they carved uh hallways out and it's just bones  everywhere it's crazy that they were just they were saying how uh wow they said like if you read 
[01:00:30]  the website it's like the faint of heart should not go to the catacombs and they're like do not bring  children for it it's too disturbing and my kids they're five and eight they were like this is the  greatest place in the entire world screw all museums there's a lot of dead people running through  these these caves just like this is so awesome that's wild and then they uh check your bags 
[01:01:00]  at the end make sure you're not bringing any bones out smuggling uh the old bone yeah i hear you  how long are the tunnels weird thing being like instead like stealing a piece of fruit from right  right like a grocery store like look what i got yeah yeah it's huge it's huge that's what i heard  yeah miles and miles right yeah i did there's only a certain amount of it that you can walk through  right yeah but uh huge what prevents the bones from falling on you they they lacquered them they  have stacked that they might uh but they have they're stacked so tight that uh it's like a puzzle 
[01:01:30]  like amazing legos like legos ah yeah yeah have you gotten the lego set of the lego catacomb  death set yes it's very that's a sick country that they're able to do that though yeah we're very  up all the graves i think it's pretty awesome it is awesome but that's that's kind of sick we actually  do it as americans we're like oh that would be oh yeah right it's poltergeist basically yeah you know  what they're doing right they're inviting a world of hurt upon them just move the headstone 
[01:02:00]  move the headstone i'm moving a whole graveyard yeah they moved everything well that sounds like a  cool trip uh i would recommend i people like when i would tweet that i was there they're like you snob  oh no i was like because well if i went to london would i be a snob like no no paris i'd rather go  to paris than london i would check it out the food is good yeah it's really good we they serve i had  i had a rabbit thank you and uh they it's called rabbit served the royal style which is they cook  it in its own blood and i have heard about it and i'm like i'm gonna get that wow i can tell a story 
[01:02:30]  on the radio and it was i fed it to my kids and they were like this is great we would like more  things boiled in blood that sounds uh no well you know what it's probably very good way better than  you would think probably very in fact come on in guys all right here it is all uh so so i guess  yeah for thanksgiving they don't have a thanksgiving over there no so i felt like you know they gave us  the statue of liberty so this is my way of repaying them did they help us in the revolutionary war too i 
[01:03:00]  mean they were they were fairly helpful a little bit and then we bought that you know louisiana purchase  napoleon needed some cash and we bought half of our country from boy did we screw him out of that  they were basically just happy whenever uh england was getting screwed right yeah yeah so kind of like  how when putin hears about something like oh oh yeah they they they will do the opposite they will take  the opposite side of whatever um england does in any kind of a battle or anything just like a 
[01:03:30]  barack obama did with like oh yeah the the anti-gay laws in russia like oh yeah well our representatives  going to be billy jane king like billy jane king's gone over there he should have just plucked some  people off of some of the floats in the uh the halloween parade here downtown that would have been  all of them just start to help just transfer an entire float right put it in one of those c-140s just  roll it in and then airdrop it over sochi that would be huge speakers blasting the scissor sisters 
[01:04:00]  we're here now that would teach those commies well ex-commies uh joel's got to leave it a list  uh yes those capitalists those guys who really figured it out quick damn joel's got to leave  an eight for uh kelly and michael but we definitely want kelly michael yeah gotta talk about community a  little bit coming back for season five congratulations yeah we started last week  thank god i did notice too um and i don't know how long it's been syndicated but i see it on other  channels we just started last september all right that's bad for the money though because you don't 
[01:04:30]  make anything jesus yeah yeah when i saw that the first thing i thought because you're front and center  in that picture it's like a judge community on bloody blood that doesn't translate to having points in the  show you're front and center but the first thing i saw was like oh yeah we talked about this when joel  first got community and you came on this show we're like syndication where the mo is that's where  you know it is not to say it's not the 80s or even the 90s things have changed drastically went 
[01:05:00]  down not a seinfeld kind of a deal or are you kidding no i i am not going to be able to hollow out  a brownstone and make it into my garage anytime really no you know what i got the other the other day  i got like a three dollar and 45 cent check from louis oh ck you were just a personal check from him  yeah it was just a personal check said please don't uh are you gonna be upset if he uh lifts your uh  young girlfriend lego story as a uh that would make a good storyline um yeah maybe i ought to get on 
[01:05:30]  that film it myself documentary style oh or gonzo style gonzo style no one's ever done that that has  not been a common way to make a comedy in the last 10 years look i always keep it absolutely above  board and legal right i know i know all this knows all the local laws pending upon i know that's why  you take so many trips to thailand well if you want boys oh i know that's terrible is chevy chase 
[01:06:00]  on the show oh no he's gone he left last november and you guys survived it which is beautiful yeah  that is dealt with uh next week and oh really oh boy okay and walton goggins from uh hope he goes  out from justified and sons of anarchy is is uh part of that episode but today tonight is the ass crack  bandit oh and i joke not now that sounds like an interesting little title uh someone at the school 
[01:06:30]  when you lean over and like to put your bag away they are dropping quarters down people's asses and  you would think that it was the basically the movie seven that's that's how it is treated it's as as  much as a murder right right so well in this day and age that could be uh misconstrued as some type  of uh abuse or um right sexual uh don glover's character after he's been ass cracked uh uh is like 
[01:07:00]  shivering he's like hey the quarter touched my butt's lips and so uh that's the sort of  stakes that we have on eight that's good eight o'clock tonight how's the work environment this  year compared to last year well having dan harman back our showrunner who was not with the show last  year was it's like the greatest loudest cough in the history of radio sounds terrific i hit the cough  button and your cough button turns it up yes maybe that's it maybe the volume blasts it out 
[01:07:30]  uh no i it's uh so uh the scripts were just dynamite and that alone having like this very clear  direction because the show was created by him it's always been in his head and so having that really  changed but i'm saying is it like is it is it uh better is it harder to work with chevy or without  him do you miss working with him well he was he didn't want to be there and that was evidenced by 
[01:08:00]  the 13 or 14 articles and the you know nicky fink or uh hollywood reporter whatever he would say he  didn't like the show and then he'd say he liked it but a lot often he would say you know he didn't  want to be there and and that that made you know when someone doesn't want to be there it's it's quite  clear does he want to be anywhere i don't think so we've heard the stories over the years yeah what's  his problem we've got a prime time game on a major network on a show that's doing well that the  critics love the critics absolutely love it great quote by you by the way i don't know if you saw  the dungeons and dragons episode your girlfriend probably probably probably yes but he was terrific 
[01:08:30]  in that he played this incredibly good villain and yeah he just you know he just didn't so what is  he doing now unknown there's a history there there's something wrong with me once in a while we'll text  each other but i don't know what he's doing i gotta ask you something though about uh the soup  yes how excited how excited are you about uh the new search show that is on it's search now please

[01:18:00]  he was on once yes and uh well the show came back last week community right and dan harman is the  showrunner again right and last season he was not and it's pretty obvious because this season like  even the first two episodes were way better damn larious how long why wasn't he there last year  because cherry chasing him had problems i bet i don't know and i i think the network had problems  with him too because he's very outspoken he doesn't he really doesn't give much of a  fuck so let's say you know but so he was gone right but he's back down the two episodes were 
[01:18:30]  really funny and uh danny putty did a a very funny nicholas cage i do enjoy a good nicholas  cage impression i guess the the homework was it's for like a film class in on the show yeah and he  had to watch five nicholas cage films oh and they said do not watch them in a row do not marathon  view these movies like it's bad for you and so this is what happened when he did a nicholas cage 
[01:19:00]  marathon oh okay this is my reality this is how i learned to be in my being says that's again yeah  we're in trouble that's that's really low you're cranked over there i'm cranked over here better  see if there's a better one yeah that's so far as lackluster oh boy yeah if no one could hear it  maybe nice setup though someone someone someone grab it and pump it up in the back maybe yeah  can you hear this nope i could do my name with cage in the meantime i can't hear this nope 
[01:19:30]  why you can yeah cast your troy  it's good right yes so bad it's terrific feel good nick cage all right let's try this one all right this one  huh huh huh dear god let's go stand back give him space  nicholas cage good or bad a challenge certainly but not insolvable 
[01:20:00]  because all actors have distinct values which i use to find answers abed how much nicholas cage did  you enough i watched enough to find the answers because this this is my reality this is how i learned  to be in my being it doesn't allow for nicholas freaking cage okay oh yeah oh yeah oh 
[01:20:30]  i'm a cat i'm a sexy cat  i think you talked it up too much if this coffee was hotter how is that not funny you'd have it 
[01:21:00]  it was i i i liked the initial oh yeah thing but then it wasn't dravis what say you he didn't do  the voice it's hilarious i i i completely agree with sam when i was when i saw this i thought it was  one of the funniest things he didn't do the like if he would have just talked like nicholas cage but  he didn't yeah yeah jimmy did more of nicholas cage yeah castor troy and mine was better huh 
[01:21:30]  what was it huh okay okay yeah see that's perfect yeah i do better cage okay all right well  let's go to joe in uh cleveland maybe hey joe uh first i want to i want to tell jim norton i laughed  pretty hard at the nabla mailing list joke that bombed the show but i thought it was hilarious the  what the other thing nabla mailing list yeah yeah yeah i thought that it's been everyone else but no one 
[01:22:00]  in the studio anyways big time fan get to the point the uh the emails come out because anyone that's a  public servant uh their emails are subject to public information on a army pest knuckleheads  you can go to any public servant and say give me your emails and they have to give you their emails  and if they delete any you can sue them and get paid and people actually do this for a living but  if they hold on hold on if they know that then why would they write emails like that and why would 
[01:22:30]  you write that state the obvious they're retarded uh oh the other thing is okay if you have you have  a uh issued a public servant blackberry or iphone or whatever it is and say you decide to sync that with  your personal handheld device uh you would get you can get that subpoenaed and then you have to  uh give that over your personal device all your pictures all your personal tech all your personal 
[01:23:00]  emails as well as your history for what you look at on the internet are also subject to review how  about i just say i have to go to the bathroom and flush down the toilet well see that you know you go to  the icloud or whatever it is and by the way that's right well impression of this cage sounds a lot  like steve the doctor the actor doing an impression yes yeah doctor steve yeah yeah  so castor oil it's good for you guys ever want to come to cleveland and go shooting uh get a hold of 
[01:23:30]  me well we were there a while ago and where were you then yeah you know i wasn't a cleveland police  officer at the time but now i am oh damn look at you yeah all right sir well yeah moving up thank  you thanks for the info i i think we i think most of us know that though yeah yeah you're not safe in  the corporate world but if they know that anyone can get at their emails it makes this even crazier 
[01:24:00]  you don't write you know let's up their traffic right but you may take it for granted that it's such  a basic thing like these guys again for them may be so commonplace that it hasn't been brought up or  that's true right governor christie's still not talking huh nah there'll be an announcement i'm  sure before he even uh he won't just pop up right let me see that um oh oh where were you going to  dennis rodman that's exactly what i was going to say dennis rodman is a fool he is a buffoon yeah 
[01:24:30]  in my humble opinion a raging alcoholic with with fucking brain damage i think he does have some  brain he's a fool yeah and now he's apologizing because i think he's you know finally realizing  that you know he's not gonna do well in america now people are pissed off what an ass he made of  himself on the world stage right and the best part of this whole story we've been talking about it for  days maybe off air i'm not sure the the guys he dragged along with those poor bastards study their 
[01:25:00]  faces the next time they show uh rodman yelling at uh chris cuomo yeah they're all sitting there  like what the did we get ourselves into firmly planting their faces in their own hand and they  look really depressed like this is what my life has come down to that i'm following this idiot he's  our spokesman he's a blithering idiot yeah and i think a lot of the players have realized oh man this  was just stupid to do bad idea yeah and now rodman's just claiming i i was drinking that's why he had the 
[01:25:30]  outburst with chris cuomo that's a good thing to do and he's starting to say that it was a bad idea  right i didn't mind his out but his chris cuomo was kind of baiting him and it's like they're there  on this basketball thing and it's like everyone knows the guy's not a politician but he sounded like  a fucking idiot oh he absolutely did yeah yeah and rodman should have been called out i mean what is  he what what is he doing really seriously he just likes the attention yeah that's why he keeps going  back there because that's all he's that's all he's got after basketball yeah it's like the the 
[01:26:00]  whole north korea thing uh worked for him so i think this is his third time back already right  i want to go is it third time i believe so you want to go to north korea yeah do we have him singing  happy birthday play badminton do a little stand-up oh maybe he's embarrassed about that too imagine if  you became like the biggest stand-up in north korea yeah they just love you and they because it gives  kim jong-un live for my big clit jokes uh let me robin sorry for outbursts is there an apology on 
[01:26:30]  cnn right now i'm seeing on their website i should have said on the front page there's a statement oh  that's just a statement i don't think he did a video one that i saw oh and you know that uh you  know how sad it is that robin's team we said this to they lost all right it's sad because they knew they  had to lose the game gotta throw that game what are you doing yeah and rodman was playing in slow  motion the whole team was playing in slow motion to let the north koreans win they have to because  some of those guys are still in relatively good shape but rodman was huffing and puffing even 
[01:27:00]  though he was playing in slow motion yeah yeah what do you got on this uh sam over there we got uh we  got him singing happy birthday we got the little jesse jackson yeah we gotta do the jesse jackson jesse  jackson's an idiot too he's kind of like supporting rodman for going over there uh but first here's  the awkward most people have heard this by now but uh maybe we'll have a couple things to say about  dennis robin singing happy birthday where is kim jong-un is he there i think so way up in the box or 
[01:27:30]  some i don't think he they actually like hung out this trip oh  happy birthday to you oh my god this is sad this is beautiful  it's like to hear kalashnikov fired riddled them how do those 
[01:28:00]  oh look at them koreans  they are a very polite structured group you sure they weren't supposed to win like the  fucking pyongyang globetrotters or something right yeah and they're like the generals  maybe what's the final score well look at this game though i mean it's just in slow motion because  they just know they can't win this game oh god look at all the people look they're not even like 
[01:28:30]  defending the north koreans nah they should be throwing some elbows oh they're all dressed the same  they're all like you said they're a very structured society oh yeah they're all dressed like viet kong  we arrived like he's huffing and puffing and  he's he looks like he's wasted there's no fun vibe there oh my god  birthday saranica murderous leader  they love black this is this this this is uh it's it's a very historical day today for everyone 
[01:29:00]  you could just say historic to see that right i mean that's hard historical coins this with each  other if we just take a take a take a take a uh take a deep breath and uh that's what it takes  this deep breath and the nuclear program will go away extortion look at look at look at certain  things so i think that it went very well for everyone involved let's go 
[01:29:30]  what is this the presenting of the trophy yes  wow they are not allowed to i i question this charles smith whether we were doing the right  thing because of the uh media scrutiny no  and uh it was important to stand strong and uh follow up and follow through and 
[01:30:00]  it all just worked out  oh look at that little chubby fucking murderer  you're a murderer i literally have no problem with them going over there though i don't have a problem  but it would be nice if there was a little bit of a better representative you're right  maybe he's just if you want to keep it all sports and stuff and this is why the media is hateable 
[01:30:30]  the only reason we know what he's saying is because they can't stop putting their cameras  on them right like if you and i went over there just as a fucking nobody would give a  shit well but but so the nsa might have a  a shit to give not really no no no i mean like there's no reason for them to he's a basketball  player playing basketball so why is it a story if they why do they need to talk to him if he's  doing nothing that's political they're the ones saying oh my god tell us about it and he's not 
[01:31:00]  saying what they like so then they're mad about it keep the cameras out of his face and no one will  know but he's talking about what a great guy he is well he's not just playing he's saying this is my  friend kim jong-un you know what though because he's excited that this guy likes him absolutely  because he has nothing going on i'm telling you but we have leaders that go over and kiss  tyrannical leaders exactly hold hands like bush is holding hands in a garden and saudi murderer  but they're not obviously wasted well yeah he's like he's up he's a drunken ass but 
[01:31:30]  a sot yeah he's just the man is a fool he's a drunken fool fool like noah was struck down and  punished for drunkenness yeah and so now robin's uh apologizing for the outburst said he was drunk  what else uh okay it was a little degrading watching him sing happy birthday oh he's also  apologizing to kenneth bay's family really because he was hinted like hey hey maybe who knows what he  did right he was basically saying hey man kenneth bay fucked up and then on the same breath he's 
[01:32:00]  probably saying free mumia that fucking guy so fuck them all is he still alive uh mumia yes he is i hate  that my last name kind of looks like the fucking name oh he's also apologizing to his teammates  i'm gonna change my name to chig oh jesus uh i want to apologize to my teammates and my management  team as well but for getting them all in this weird situation uh-huh so yeah it is a weird situation  i embarrassed a lot of people said rodman who traveled to north korea with other former nba 
[01:32:30]  players i'm very sorry at this point over 300 million i think i should know better than to make  political statements i'm truly sorry yeah that that maybe this is a problem the the the he doesn't  no he should have just said i don't know those circumstances so the day of the interview he was  very stressful some of my teammates were leaving because of pressure from their families and business  associates he said uh it was quickly falling apart the whole thing i've been drinking he said that's  good you're the guy you know in charge of the whole thing and you're fucking partying yeah that's smart 
[01:33:00]  yeah it's not excuse but the time the interview happened i was upset i was overwhelmed so i was  trying to cover his ass because he knows people hate him in this country now but they really should  i mean again what he said about that guy was dumb but it's no different than uh what anybody else  does we're friends with horrible leaders and countries and whatnot you're right yeah it is kind  of silly i think joe namens should go over there next i want to kiss you you little son of a  bitch come here you little chubby fuck i want to kiss you 
[01:33:30]  fucking trucking broadway joe another sot yeah he's he's executed for trying to make love to kim  john hun's fat little mouth you're pretty i'll kiss you oh god sorry buddy broadway joe uh kim john  really seemed to be enjoying himself you asked if he was there he certainly was it looked like he was  enjoying himself it did what else is going on over there how fun can executions be if you're doing 
[01:34:00]  them every day where do they get all the all the same fucking clothes for that entire oh believe me  some kids are fucking sewing holy kids are sewing in factories they're all dressed in a very nice black  suit yeah imagine that you they open up a fucking like a north korean barneys right here's a nice black  suit we have this black suit you want some black slacks yeah it's a black shirt here's a red tie if  you want to be arrested and executed i bet you they all had to give those clothes back at the end 
[01:34:30]  probably did for the next uh event yeah yeah yeah they are a broke ass fucking country and then we got uh  we need sam here because he's got the jesse jackson clip sam they asked jesse jackson about um the whole  robin thing and because dennis rodman's black i'm sure he supported him for no other reason uh pretty  much there was a charity thing a guy did i have to say hello to somebody real quick because i forgot to  do it where he there was a he won a thing and there was a charity so hello to lando 244 uh cj colando 
[01:35:00]  um i fucked up now but it was a good charity thing it's like getting money got donated somewhere i think  uh it was it was nothing it was just i promised i'd mention him and i've been forgetting to do it for a  month he didn't lose the falcon in a card game he could have sold that it's a different lando this  is not the handsome black mustache oh see i that we all jerked off to can we see the uh jesse jackson  clip yeah please so yeah jesse jackson it's just a fucking ideas jesse brother jesse i was watching 
[01:35:30]  a great little documentary about the yeah mlk assassination it was um mike baker was doing it  on um what the hell is that travel channel his show on travel channel it's very cool they got  unprecedented access to the hotel and the the room and they fucking put little strings back and forth 
[01:36:00]  and and then mike fucking you know they set up a thing and takes the fucking shot and yeah you know  what they because there's people that double they concluded that you know yeah james already  fucking fired into his face from the fucking bathroom window but uh it was cool because you  never see like the host really take the shot they always have an expert marksman but mike baker's like  fuck you i'll take the right out of my way you know how many people i've killed anyway you know  allegedly how's the shot uh good he's a good fucking shot man yeah he hasn't lost it nah something 
[01:36:30]  tells me he stays in training i'm sure when he's not on tv i think he's doing horrible things around  the globe now he's retired yeah well yeah there's so many retired people from the agency sure uh jesse  jackson but yeah they had the picture where jesse's pointing right hey over there you know well now  jesse jackson speaking up about dennis rodman okay well rodman called today's game in front of 14 000  spectators quote historic but very story agree with rodman's assessment reverend jesse jackson joins 
[01:37:00]  me now right i want to i want to put this up on january 6th it appears that you tweeted this congrats  at dennis rodman your diplomacy efforts in north korea it must be dark but you are a light  well that's backwards was deleted what do you mean are you supporting dennis rodman  no let me make what clear is that then the ping pong team went to china  what on the situation no one expected the ping pong team to change u.s 
[01:37:30]  channel policy i thought they went to hong kong to the soviet union saying that's where georgia  brown play ping pong no one expected the change u.s civil policy it was an illuminating moment  out of palette to more political diplomatic efforts those efforts are a bit different uh reverend because  no one sanctioned this trip for him to go to north korea everyone is denouncing this trip with all  that's going on in north korea with the camps with the people who are not eating with the poverty  in the country that sounds fun dictator with not being allowed to use uh information cell phones 
[01:38:00]  computers it seems like you're comparing apples to oranges here well no you know i sent a letter  to the north korean leader uh to address it to my wife urging him on humanitarian brown's release uh  what is he saying with an old man down in his back and a diabetic on top of his mother today that's  the role i would play the role that ambassador richmond or richardson would play our president  crowd would play but we are professional diplomats to that extent exactly dennis rodman dennis rodman is 
[01:38:30]  not a professional well that's just the point though then why are you talking about why should he be  congratulated or encouraged here and the and the ping pong clubs are not professional diplomats  stuff about the ping pong and and the hollum globe brothers over here were not professional either  it's shit light on the dog situation they shit light i want to see that how can people take dennis  rodman serious after this interview with uh chris cuomo and saying that american kenneth bay is guilty of 
[01:39:00]  something listen uh-huh can obey that one thing what if you understand i gotta go if you understand what  kiddin bay did yeah do you understand what he did what did he do you tell me country you tell me no no no no  no no no no why is he held captain they haven't released any charges they haven't released they  haven't released the players behind them oh shut everybody up better work i believe you're great 
[01:39:30]  spokesman i want to say with kenneth bay's family told cnn they said they're appalled by robin's behavior and  by all accounts bay is being held illegally by north korea right you've been on diplomatic missions  do you think robin is not going to get any more transformable until they fucking release him  you know right robinson i'm a basketball player what and we won't want to lose him as basketball  player cuomo did a serious diplomatic interview with him about his position about about kenneth bay  which i thought was off base because robin says i'm just a ball player and the traditional ball 
[01:40:00]  players uh and singers who go these on that's what i'm the they pull them over out of his zone  your point oh wow i didn't get that at all i didn't quite catch that part here when uh cuomo  question the reverend jesse roland north korea the team of former nba players was a good idea listen  i'm just saying i'm golden bunch in korea  look at them yeah but dennis don't put it on them don't use them as an excuse for the 
[01:40:30]  sounds like an african king in the middle of nowhere in the congo or something around the big pot  this circus environment seeing the anger from a dennis rodman we're trying to get north korea to  scale black back its nuclear program but i would not confuse the role of of dennis rodman and  basketball and the globe basketball and ping pong in china with serious diplomacy that's no but  entertainment does have an interesting way for illuminating why are we discussing north korea 
[01:41:00]  today because of dennis rodman i'm a hundred percent in agreement with jesse jackson wow  holy hundred percent in agreement with him but the one part they're not really discussing is the  fact that dennis rodman did this for himself and that's it yeah because he got this weird attention  from uh kim jong-un the and he's going with it like wow this is cool i haven't been in the spotlight  in years and this guy this the korean dictator loves the loves me to death so now i'm going to go 
[01:41:30]  over there and do things because i know everyone is going to talk about me dennis rodman the hero  worship of this guy and the praise that he's putting on uh kim jong-un that seems to be one  of the biggest problems because i mean if you're going to go over there and play a sporting event and  meet the president and speak with him you could say yeah we had a great dialogue but that's just it he's  incapable of of expressing himself like that he's just oh he's a great guy no he's not a great guy and to  say that he is is it coming across as propaganda and he's saying all that because he he wants this 
[01:42:00]  to continue exactly that that is true but again when when these guys again when bush i don't care  if it's real diplomacy or not this is a guy who makes policy is holding hands with a guy he's not  saying hey this saudi is a great guy he doesn't need to say it he's not president that wasn't professional  i just wanted to hold his hand he's hand holding the garden like yeah yeah the the the love we have  for these animals around the world who truly mistreat and kill people why is that any different 
[01:42:30]  this guy's a basketball player treat him like one and don't do serious that is true but you could  you could look at that huge picture um and you'll never get an answer because it'll always be uh  hypocritical or you can look at what the situation is and that is we do pick and choose which countries  are dubbed evil which ones are dubbed evil that we do something about which are dubbed evil that we don't  um and and north korea has been put on that list of countries that um we don't want to do business 
[01:43:00]  with we don't touch in any way shape or form and to have an american go over there and talk about this  guy like he's great and a good friend and and this it it comes off as um as uh kim jong-un using  an american citizen comes off self-serving again self-serving all the way well for both of them of  course you know for kim jong-un it's wonderful to have an american saying how great he is and for  you know for mr reality show he loves this right but we look but again look who it is like flavor 
[01:43:30]  of flame going over there nobody looks at this guy of course it would be hilarious wow what's that  although rodman might be more entertaining than flavor flav these days oh that's true nobody looks  at dennis rodman as a guy who's going to come back with a serious political that's what bothers me it's  like we're looking at him and going why isn't he doing this when we know he's a guy that put on  a woman's dress and rode a motorcycle what the do we expect from this guy like this is what he does  he don't take it so seriously don't take it seriously and realize that this guy is an absolute 
[01:44:00]  clown yeah looking for some attention for himself or how about say chris cuomo period what are the  korean people like yeah we know you're an athlete and a big dictator like she's whatever what are the  korean people like what is your interaction with the korean people that would be nice but i'm sure  they're not showing him that side of it either you know they're not letting him walk around the  public um true uh without uh supervision he can't just go to some apartment building where people are  living in squalor and starvation which is happening over there sure it's happening everywhere in the  world that we have well yeah but then but but then again you don't you don't talk about what a great 
[01:44:30]  guy he is you could sit there and talk about um um how a leader of a country has increased productivity  uh you know money trade without saying he's a great guy or he's my friend or he's my friend or or sing  happy birthday to him there's a difference when you it's so obvious that kim jong-un and north korea is  using an american citizen as a propaganda tool um regardless of how well it works or not that's what 
[01:45:00]  he's doing and robin's a dummy for playing into it yeah yeah it's a little you know he knows he has to  sing happy birthday i have no problem with it either right right and he knows he has to sing  happy birthday to the guy to keep it going that looked degraded that's embarrassing for rodman that  he did it was it was and then he was bowing oh yeah i don't know look at uh beyonce and they all  they sing for dictators for a million dollars a shot they know what they're doing my dictator  well it's all wrong jimmy yeah but i have no issue with any of the entertainment stuff because again 
[01:45:30]  i know what they are robin's the guy who fucking stops a ball from going through a hoop i don't  take anything he says politically seriously it's valueless i don't think anyone does no it's just  the fact that he went over there yeah and he's kissing this asshole's um ass that seems to be the  the issue i i think if he wasn't doing that i think the criticism would really come off as as  silly just fuck it but i think that fucked him up as far as him looking like an idiot well then we  should criticize it may sound crazy let's all attack the woman who married charles manson 
[01:46:00]  all right the fucking bastard woman who married richard ramire like okay but you know what i'm  saying it's like we're just selective and that's what bothers me all right listen we got to take a  break because uh we got the impractical jokers coming up but before that i want to do the uh the  men that dress as living dolls that we uh teased yesterday and and i know jimmy's got to leave early  so we want to definitely do that before uh he gets out of here so yeah we certainly can go back to the  rodman thing i'm sure there's going to be more shit about that coming out in the coming days 
[01:46:30]  anyway yes all right um stay there after 20 years you would want to break too but the guys are back  now enjoy it's the opium entity show on sirius xm i think we're going to do the impractical uh jokers  now and then we'll have time to do the uh men dress as living dolls yes thing after that before jimmy  leaves for north carolina where you gonna be uh jimmy i'm at good nights tonight through saturday yeah

[01:50:00]  inter in an interview you guys are from staten island yes oh i wasn't going to say that i do  know that i'm gonna go right to the show without without reading the one sheet i know that because  i do watch impractical jokers yeah and supposedly i met one of you guys on the street but i think that  was rolling just lying but he he refuses to give up the lie uh right yeah i remember when you had  first watched the show yeah uh you regretfully gave us props for liking it you were like uh i didn't 
[01:50:30]  want to like it i didn't want to like it pulling it off these guys and i i almost named it oh they  might be listeners of the show no i was surprised i liked it i guess because you know a lot of the prank  shows i don't know they that's they're they're right oh that's right we're on it doesn't matter  that's great yes all right once you wait thanks man doesn't he going to the gym eating better  aging matter why don't we start with this uh explain the show for the people out there that 
[01:51:00]  haven't seen it yet murray's the best yeah go ahead the show is uh well we've been best friends  high school went to uh monsignor farrell all boys catholic high school on sale all right stop  describing it it was hot why did you go to an old boys high school it seemed like the thing to do at  the time no man i i mean i almost went down that road and my mom was the one like hell no  if you saw me in high school i think you'd understand this story sounds like it's going to  turn into that brad pitt movie where they all get raped yeah we all met in the nurse's office

[01:52:00]  because you don't have the parties and all that what are the skills you have because you're not  talking to girls every day just in and out of class no no i had i had no skills with girls until  well after college as a result had yeah i think that's weird because it's it's tough enough to like  be brave enough to ask a girl out or something that you see every day and you guys have to go  find it somewhere else did you do things with other like girls schools yeah yeah i had like three  sister schools oh so they would all converge like they would be there for drivers ed after school 
[01:52:30]  q and mer were in the drama club who was the only way that you could meet girls so like we would be  doing like west side story the girl backstage you can be who are you doing are you doing finger  player are you doing finger quotes when you say girls mean girls i mean murray backstage  finger bagger would be like the nurse's office all over again joe was joe was the president of the

[01:54:00]  whole school cleared out always one guy that ruins it with like a star that's now his audience does  wait a minute hey wait a minute we had a vermin day everyone brought in a rodent and then we  released it at the exact same time yeah but not just that's four like everybody was in on it yeah  that's pretty cool how many did you guys get i mean okay there was probably you know a hundred that's  that's that's impressive yeah really says a lot for staten island yeah just fine rodent well this

[02:01:00]  okay together i did bye bye birdie in high school i don't know if you know that's  oh that's a comedy that's good catholic boys in dresses playing the girls parts  yeah that's great we uh we tried uh tried tv a few times and we sold a couple of pilots but  none of them went to series yeah okay what were some of the ones that didn't quite wash we we we  shot a uh a sketch comedy pilot for spike a few years back uh about a year before we sold 
[02:01:30]  impractical jokers oh was it a mix between uh mythbusters and jackass because that's the one  they were trying to sell us on wow it's like a mix between okay that's all right how do we  describe it what was it like myth-ass like yeah yeah pretty much jackbusters pretty much that was  the pitch for real oh wow yeah we're just never able to figure out what to do with the pilot well  done oh good awful no we did the pilot for the comedy central thing that was how did that come 
[02:02:00]  out is it is there any way to see that it's a good question i got it i'd love to see it i got it i'd  love to see it we knew we were in trouble when one of the big wigs from uh economy central came by and  stopped talking to us during filming when they stopped talking during filming he stopped talking  those oh wow but we going into it we said this this is a horrible idea like i don't worry about  we'll figure it out as we go sucks literally they want to figure it out as we go yeah i love that  one disaster we actually we did that without with our show with impractical jokers really in the 
[02:02:30]  beginning just winging it the format yeah just like figuring out but that's kind of conducive to just  you know and you guys know each other for so long and you you know that's what helps we're not cast i  mean yeah it's not story driven or you know it's a sad story if it was what's some examples of uh  you're doing to people uh currently yeah currently what was the rice thing i want to know well oh the  right okay that's where we all brought uh 10 pound bags of rice to school all the seniors and then at 
[02:03:00]  an appointed time we cut the bag and dumped it all over the place it looked like like scarface like when  he's dumping like there's just white powder everywhere it was great yeah so how did you hide  10 pound bags of rice in your backpack all right wow oh can't do that yeah do that now  swats all around the school again you can't do anything heavy backpack show up to school yeah yeah  nothing to see here beating you over the head yeah absolutely what's good about impractical jokers they 
[02:03:30]  with each other big yeah yeah that's what makes this show really good we uh we got sal bad a few  weeks ago we yeah we wanted to do this for three years we crashed a wedding in long island oh we  weren't invited there's 300 guests there none of them knew us and we wrote uh q joe and i wrote a  speech for sal he had never seen it before and he had to get out there and grab the mic when they were  toasting oh man that's brutal and deliver the speech that we wrote it was up you could say that  that's what's great they set up you know one guy yeah yeah like it would be incredibly embarrassing 
[02:04:00]  if you just decided what you were going to say in front of this wedding but you leave you know they  leave it up to the other guys and then the one guy has to deal with it were they horrified  what was some of the stuff you said it was 300 people and i do it by the end they were holding  people back from cup from charging wow really these were playing waiters and they had to go up and  literally grab people's shoulders and make them sit but don't you know that there's a problem when you're  going into a wedding and you don't know what anyone's doing yet at least don't you realize they've all 
[02:04:30]  disgusted and you have no you're obviously the one in the spit yeah because that was a punishment so  how the show works is there's like three like let's say challenges during the show we all compete  against each other whoever does the worst gets punished right so i knew i was walking into my  punishment oh you know yeah and they're not going to be nice no i think i think i think i closed the  speech by saying well first of all their name was their names are gary and crystal and i'm like the gary  and crystal i'm reading this we both know are dead and from the ashes rises garstle 
[02:05:00]  and i go i want to tell you guys something that my grandfather told me when i was younger that gave me  chills and i still feel to this day he said sal i shot a lot of japs in world wars guys there's no  denying you great together but sometimes marriage can be like war don't let the japanese get into  and the mother-in-law is just sitting there like who the wait so they open up the floor if anyone has 
[02:05:30]  something to say or i walked in after like the best man speech right and they just they took them just  grabbed them one person who i was there yeah one person oh wow they just i took the mic and said i got  a friend okay because we're suspicious of that's set up we're just talking about uh grandpa yeah  yeah um bad grandpa yeah bad grandpa and how you know um some of that stuff obviously some of it  possibly yeah borat and stuff but uh yeah what i was going to ask you oh uh did you get clearance to 
[02:06:00]  show it on the show yeah yeah so how did that how did you flip that after everyone's all pissed off  does someone make the announcement like hey let's chill out here yeah our producers go up and say and  it's the magic of tv and everybody's like oh my god you know there's a fair amount of people that  didn't sign there was like one or two tables that were really they were the same ones that had the  polaroid ripped up and uh connie and carlos wedding right so you just cube those people out and you're  good well yeah they we just blur the people that would be on tv right right wow that's a great one damn 
[02:06:30]  hell yeah i mean we've been doing it three years so we just kind of keep pushing it so we can if i'm  terrified we know it's gonna work probably so you should have finished it off with the evoking your  right of a prima nocta first night oh there yeah yes the old bride yes like caligula once said  we just got joe at the casino in atlantic city uh he was punished we put him on stage  well that's in tonight's episode right oh yeah tonight do you want to tell him what we did to you 
[02:07:00]  you know this is they uh we were at the borgata filming they let us film there at the borgata  which is cool and uh my favorite we show up at the theater and they're like uh all right joe  we're gonna put on a show i was like all right and they're like you're gonna be an escape artist  i was like oh okay so i walk out on the stage and they have these two hot girls that come out and  so i'm out there i'm like all right i got i don't think to do here is own it be like all right i'm  gonna escape the theater's full for thousands yeah so i'm like hello everyone so i put on a show 
[02:07:30]  right wait wait wait i'm gonna slow you down why is the theater full though because we got the borgata  to tell we'll give it out comps yeah oh it's a show review okay thank you so we had 45 minutes of  real show on a real show a real magician comes out he's sawing the in half the whole  so then i walk out and just this red they put me in a sequence like uh so i'm like hello i'm gonna  escape but i don't know from what so these two hot girls walk out they walk out with this uh 
[02:08:00]  straight jacket so i'm like okay i'll be in the straight jacket and i'll escape before your very  eyes and i was about to start they walk out with chains and they chain me up and they're like oh and  i'm like and plus these chains and then they're like they can walk out and then they come back  again and they tie my feet together so i'm like all right now i'm standing in front of a thousand  people in a straight jacket with chains and my feet together i'm like all right probably no  confidence that you can do this i have nothing left and i'm like all right so i'm just gonna stand here  and screw i'm like an idiot and then hopefully something happens like a chain falls off right  right right and the curtain opens and the curtain opens and i turn around and there's a fucking  water tank no yeah and they have a fucking winch winch or whatever the fuck it is and they hook me up 
[02:08:30]  and they lift me up into a phone booth size water tank and drop me in and the water's literally up to  his lips the water's rising so i'm like oh yeah we put a hose in so the water's rising and i'm like  okay so i'm gonna die in front of a thousand people for television on basic cable were you scared i was  i was i was because now i'm feeling claustrophobic and i'm like these guys gotta know when to stop the 
[02:09:00]  water and i'm just ripping like a fucking fish that's chained up smacking against the wall and i'm  there for 27 minutes in the water people sitting there like this expecting the old women wouldn't leave  they were like they want to see it through to the end yeah so after a while and the crowd turned  they at first they were amused and laughing they thought it was part of the shtick right then they  were curious and confused then they came around and were rooting for the underdog and then they became  desperate just man wow we turned up the house i shut the music stopped the smoke and everything 
[02:09:30]  and it was just dead silent then we sent the guy up to sweep the place and these old blue hands would not  leave it was just sitting there that's great so i got upset at one point lady's like you can do it  i'm like no i can't you can do it a half hour soaking water that escapes is hard dude i give them props  that they're able to pull that off because that's crazy hard oh that's hilarious well that sounds fun  that's tonight that's tonight yeah very cool this show has taught me that we have no skills whatsoever 
[02:10:00]  we can't do anything sometimes that works and also what people will believe like when you speak with  confidence yeah yeah yeah it's really funny like people will believe like when you're out there  and you're like half the stuff we're like we're gonna get punched in the face like if we try this  yeah yeah people are willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and like believe what you're saying  for you know it just depends on how long someone's willing to to go with that what was your we really  try to throw each other under the bus that's why it's great yeah but some people we've all gotten 
[02:10:30]  choked punched do you ever have people suggest things to you like yeah you ought to try that  oh we got and really a that the ones that are too mild and b ones that are just horrendous you should  be a zookeeper yeah stuff like that you know what is a lot of people don't understand the the that we  go through so many ideas like we'll come up with thousands of ideas and get the ones that we need  so it's so like if i hear something and somebody comes out to me and it's like hey i have an idea  and it's something new i get excited because we've come up with so many yeah yeah yeah you know 
[02:11:00]  i have a right now it's you got it yes oh jimmy this is like a good nature one for a good nature  that's good you you uh you take all the tags that say medium and you put l's on them and then you just  watch people try on the wrong side of the wrong side that's hilarious that's what we get we either get  stuff like that it's really ridiculous or they go the other way they go extreme and they're like you  you should go punch germans yeah yeah i didn't finish you put anthrax in all the clothes 
[02:11:30]  yeah you got jimmy fresh kills you got it now what's one of the best uh uh uh ones you did  shit we had uh this guy we they made us play dentists right yeah i mean that's nerve-wracking too  because you're in the room alone you're dressed as a dentist it's a real dentist office and a real  patient walks in yeah so it's like we couldn't believe we got a dentist to let us do this you  know we're fans of the show now so like so we'll put it out on facebook like yeah come here do it 
[02:12:00]  you're like dude you could go to jail i mean that has to violate some kind of law  the sanitation guy took care of  what's wrong with you guys watch next week  you're a dentist and someone's about to walk in and it's like what the what's the first thing you 
[02:12:30]  even say you have no clue so we all went i put the guy in the in the chair and it was like this  new state-of-the-art place and had like the before he briefed us on the room and he's like this is like  a twenty thousand dollar chair yeah i was like what does it do it goes up eight feet i don't know  why i don't know why eight feet in the air and it goes completely so i put the guy in the chair and  they go just raise him up raising up eight feet so i raised on he's he's talking to me he's like  i'm in pain man near my teeth and he's eight feet he's about six six seven feet in the air 
[02:13:00]  and then it turns this way so his feet are by the ceiling and his head is down like an inversion table  like one of those inversion table he literally it was holding on for that paper napkin they put on  you and sal starts crying laughing in front of the patient right and can't take it and what and  leaves the room i just i don't know just stuff like that i mean i'm just i don't know what am i  doing what is going on well like yeah two weeks ago they brought me to the brooklyn brooklyn children's 
[02:13:30]  yeah that was great and they're like i was my day to get punished so i didn't know what's going to happen  and then they i look in a room and there's like a bunch of kids sitting there with their parents  like 25 kids and their parents yeah and they're like oh okay so here's you should punch them  you're a children's book author and you're going to read the book that we made and these  motherfuckers made up a children's book a full published book that was vaguely about my life 
[02:14:00]  but threw in a divorce and they had me uh like as an anthropomorphic uh dung beetle with a hat and  a scarf that i wear on the show often and and like i'm sitting there and i'm going and what was it like  you oh my god you lost your job domestic abuse you gave a drug my favorite page in the book was uh  when he's at the the height of his depression right he's lost his wife his kids his job everything this  dung beetle the next page is the dung beetle sitting inside of a car and there's like a hot 
[02:14:30]  female dung beetle nearby and the caption only says how much  so i'm sitting there and i'm trying to did you turn the book to the kids to show the illustration  i didn't have to because they made a giant five-foot version and i had to flip each page and you just  see the parents face horrified horrified and then it came around again they started laughing because i  started breaking down so it's you know it's a weird line yeah he was in the parking lot of a waffle house  when he was soliciting i was selling jeans or was it waffle home yeah yeah you know selling blue 
[02:15:00]  jeans to make money so that i could eat that night dungarees dungarees well of course it goes with  the dung beetle yeah are there anything you wouldn't do or someone said no i'm actually not gonna do it  can't say no to a punishment we have a gentleman's agreement that you wouldn't but who comes up with  the punishments because they never really secretly conspire we do oh okay damn yeah but that you got to  write that stuff up and be clever about it yeah well we we have a full production team and they like  hide the details from the guy but sometimes we just like really mess with you like when we threw 
[02:15:30]  murray out of the plane he thought we were doing a challenge like he thought we were doing a team  challenge where we were teaching classes at this skydiving place murray's definitely a friend  you guys did the long con on that one they had uh they wrote pages we wrote lines for the challenge  i wrote jokes oh i'm running on the way there so we show up and we're filming the intro i didn't see  this one you gotta explain this so it we we show up uh at skydive new york out out in east long  out the back story is i'm terrified of heights and for as long as you guys know me for 24 years i'd  say that i would never fucking jump out right right saying you get one life that's it why would you 
[02:16:00]  ever put that in jeopardy so unless she's hot in which case so we uh we showed up uh at the skydive  we're like hey we came up with this challenge where we're going to teach because we do that sometimes we  teach as experts we're like we're going to teach skydiving lessons he's like oh it's going to be  awesome they have a hanger set up they have a full hangar yeah so you weren't thinking you were  gonna i'm thinking i'm a teacher right on the ground in the in the air air hangar there teaching  students what they're going to experience when they go up so we've all the props laid out we film 
[02:16:30]  the intro where we tell the audience what we're about to do and he has the first line so he says  for the first line hey we're out here in comac new york teaching uh teaching skydiving lessons and the  three of us all go well actually we're here for your punishment and he flips out yeah he he he  started crying like a little girl locked himself in the van yeah what's not on t today or last week  what's not on tv is i i seriously locked myself in the men's room for why when you guys show that 
[02:17:00]  part i said joe's like keep a fucking camera away from me and i had a full-blown he's like a  bye text to his mother wow what you had to go up and jump yeah they threw me out what height  fifteen thousand feet that's real that's a high jump that's wait so how do they  fucking twenty feet it's it's over you're dead you're dead until you're eight feet from the ground  you're dead until that moment eight feet you can survive eight feet anything more if you fell out of  that dentist chair you might die walk us through it so now you're in the bathroom how they get you out  to do the i had a breakdown i i said to joe keep the cameras away i i need i need time and i came out 
[02:17:30]  from the bathroom and i was like okay i'll do it because like we said we made a gentleman's  agreement four years ago you can't say no to a punishment i mean we're nothing if we're not  gentlemen uh i went on the plane i i was as the plane went further and further up i was in literally  in tears it was literally in tears when the door opened because i had never been skydiving but the  door is like one of those like uh you know when a convenience store closes like yeah it closes like  those right right he opens that at 15 000 feet all of us were like we're just we're gonna kill 
[02:18:00]  this guy i'm jumping tandem with this guy so i said to the guy i pulled him aside on the ground  i said listen is this like the movies if i get you all you do you're connected through these just like  hooks right he's got the parachute on you don't right he's got the parachute i don't have a  if i get disconnected you have nylon straps around me like nylon how strong is nylon  right is that what stockings are made of so i said i said uh if i get disconnected from you are you 
[02:18:30]  going to do what they do in the movies and like dive fast toward me when you pull the cord he goes  no no first rule of skydiving is you save yourself that's what you tell me oh my god but you didn't  have to go through training or any of that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no  they did it like uh danny aiello and fort apache you look at him and you're like all right he's 
[02:19:00]  crying and it's on it's on the episode that he's crying and i and you start to feel bad but then i'm  just like wait last season he made me teach sex ed to my parents for 45 minutes so he can go  himself like if i can throw him out the plane that's a little embarrassing yeah how was the jump  i was it was terrifying to the moment i thought you hated it huh it got even scarier when you pulled the  cord because then then you're slowly floating to your day when you pull the cord you jerk back up  you come up you do right yeah you jerk back up and then and then people are like oh you're gonna 
[02:19:30]  experience a zen moment there was not one moment because still you're still 4 000 feet up in the  air yeah when you're slowly floating yeah still slip out of the harness you're still dead how long  the whole thing take two minutes you 60 seconds free fall 60 seconds was that it oh okay 60s i just  can't do that they had cameramen like a lot jump out with them right so we had the whole fall sure  taped right in his face yeah and for the whole fall the whole fall he is it's like a blair witch 
[02:20:00]  camera right on me you know hysterically crying the whole fall i'm gonna go i'm going home and watch  i will say i was screaming like a yeah would you do it again though because you've done it once never  never never you just never liked it if i want to die like like when i'm like 85 and i'm done i've  got nothing left yes i'll die i'll jump out of that was the big like selling point for him they were  like uh when you do it man don't worry you're gonna love it you'll want to do it yeah it was like  there's no way i'm ever doing that again what's it like stepping i'm always like a man like you're 
[02:20:30]  stepping off the plane like the door is open and what is it like that first step out it's terrifying  you don't step off they scoot you to the edge and you just like rock they rock you one two three and  then you just yeah oh you get sucked out yeah you just kind of drop yeah you just fall like you  don't yeah you just fall out and then you just tumble a few times before they put out that little  stabilizing thing and then what's the stabilizing thing it's a tiny little drill that just keeps  your back to the sky and you did you guys jump to we went a few years ago but i mean you didn't do it  that same day after you were done taping or anything landed safe we knew that we ran the risk he might 
[02:21:00]  seriously have it like like a heart attack about it so i was going to be the backup but he did it he  stepped up what's the safety i never heard about that there's a little one that you a pre-parachute  yeah it's two pairs three right there's three parachutes three yeah the safety no but i mean  which is the one that the drogue shoot like holds you like where you fall like this yeah you don't  spin it's just a tiny little thing so you're not rolling end over end it kind of but it doesn't  really slow you down no no it's just to stabilize yeah yeah it's deployed it's like a sea anchor it just 
[02:21:30]  keeps you facing down and does it interfere with the other thing or no apparently not it's a dumb  question yeah it's a mess well does everyone die ever that was a good point yeah that's a dumb  question what's their safety record out there did you check yeah we did the guy actually the guy  that he jumped with had what 18 000 jumps 19 000 successful doesn't matter everyone's got however  many they have before the one that took them yeah it doesn't matter that was his point exactly he's 
[02:22:00]  like it only takes one just one like it jesus christ amazing uh well tonight uh wait what channel  hold on true tv 10 o'clock on thursdays we never said what channel impractical uh jokers of course  season three what a blast man the tenderloins.com is the website and you go to facebook.com  slash impractical jokers for james cell brain and uh joe very cold great man guys thanks for coming  in uh funny motherfuckers yeah absolutely definitely come back and see us thanks cool thanks 
[02:22:30]  figuring out the tv show i guess but we took a lot of tv meetings everyone wanted god to do something  with us they just couldn't figure it out i don't know and honestly we couldn't figure it out no because  it was always based it's on the radio show and i think the best idea for us as far as that would be  um a show about the radio show it's based like the anchor part the base to be this is this and then 
[02:23:00]  it shows the difference in the three of our lives or it's amazing so if they you know did that spend  some time with you spend some time with me some time with jimmy in our individual things i think  that'd be great go with our strengths we know how to do this yeah yeah we know how to do this put it on  your tv on your tv then we could do a little something something on the side as well exactly  governor christy's gonna talk at 11. what oh boy christy to talk about the traffic scandal at 11. man 
[02:23:30]  will i be watching you think he's going to do an hard-butt wire all right could you imagine he comes  out with a paper bag all right good way everybody oh my god and then he opens up the paper bag and  there's like cannolis in there sure you think he's stress eating right now yes he is i would believe uh  yeah he's doing exactly that i know jimmy's for this and maybe i should wait until he gets back  from the bathroom but the cleveland indians uh demote the chief wahoo logo and they're going to go  with the big uh c logo let's see oh kind of like uh the red sox so demote by meaning it's over like 
[02:24:00]  got rid of it completely they're going to take this off the uniforms that's been the symbol of the indians um  cleveland indians since the 1940s wow yeah damn but you know out of nowhere it's deemed racist even  though for many many many many many decades no one gave a shit in general well i hope that changes  things for the uh american indian i'm sure it'll but this will do oh that's right nothing this pc 
[02:24:30]  shit is just steamrolling over everything we know yeah it's unbelievable yeah i can't stand it  i know jimmy would be a supporter of this i i would assume right yeah probably but i guess the  indians have started using the c i i don't know this the the red c i'm not a big fucking cleveland  indians uh fans i don't know what the hell they're doing over there uh being replaced as a primary logo  on the uniform uh let's see instead the team will emphasize a block letter c they introduced in recent 
[02:25:00]  seasons that's uh creative the uh indians are eliminating the chief the home uniform  will continue to feature him on caps and jersey sleeves but fans will will less of him fit but  fans will less of him overall that's exactly what that says so yeah we'll see less of it overall so  they're phasing it out slowly i guess wahoo yeah you're for this i 100 yeah i was speaking for you  oh thank you but i assumed you were for this yeah 100 he also said you like sucking cock he was 
[02:25:30]  speaking for you you should have said that first  the pittsburgh pirates now the pittsburgh pirates are ditching their eye patch wearing jolly roger in  favor of of a gold pea why golden pea that's ridiculous well but this is why i think you do  have to fight for some of this because they just keep going what's the problem with an actual pirate on  your uniform but is that why they're doing it or is it simply like when the patriots eventually changed 
[02:26:00]  the guy they just got sick of it right i don't know that's a good question what does the article  say about the pirates guy  this article just says that they're doing it they're just doing it i think it's just more of  a change yeah i think i think it might be an aesthetic i've never heard about complaining pirate americans  they get all angry at um at the pirates although it's very scary the no according to this article  it says uh as with any other major league baseball team the indians and pirates are trying to maximize 
[02:26:30]  the dollars they can make marketing their product while hurting as few feelings as possible but what  is the jolly roger hurt i don't know somalis you're kidding no i am kidding holy  shit you just i was ready to just oh my god somalis it's that guy i'm the captain now i'm the captain  chief wahoo what a douchey name yes it is douchey chief wahoo i guess they removed him from the road 
[02:27:00]  uniform uh in recent seasons it was probably fun back in the 40s when they came up with it i'm glad they took  that out good look chief wahoo let's buy a shirt what douchebag looks at that fucking thing and  thinks it's a cool logo you could buy them over by the white drinking fountain i had a chief happy  we had a homer knock a homer yeah i never had a problem with it and i never even even had a thought  that it might be racist thought about it completely honest with you right never thought twice i'm very 
[02:27:30]  upset by the italian chef on pizza boxes that's putting his fingers together and going he goes  that to me is a racist logo that assumes that you know it's always some italian guy look see he's right  down there that's him right there that guy's on all the pizza boxes so we should get rid of that right  fucking okay sign making guinea i don't like it he's like mama mia that's a good pizza 
[02:28:00]  very offended do you think i could get that taken off a black guy you think i could get that taken  off the pizza boxes i'm gonna try i bet you could listen jimmy's leaving in a few minutes i want him to  see some of this doll shit real fast oh yeah these guys are fucked up i saw um a minute clip last night  i am crazy you're blown away by it but i also thought immediately about our fine radio show and 
[02:28:30]  i oh someone has to do this yes someone how do we do this wow of course the go-to guy e-rock  but has to do this it's got to be someone a little more svelte but how do you do no  hell no we got to have a mess of a body yeah  this would have been perfect for cream pie jones oh yeah  would you want to see him in this well let's call him up and get him on the show  how about david oh my god kenny kenny in this kenny they've never done enough rubber how do we do this 
[02:29:00]  we have to do this yeah well why don't we play the video yeah see see what this is all about like  guys are going around looking like uh dolls yeah there's i i this probably came from an idea i'm  thinking this is my um uh hypothesis it probably came from guys that want to dress like chicks  and then they put on the makeup they put the wig on they put the dress on and they look like  shit they look like guys in like women's clothing right and look terrible so then they probably saw 
[02:29:30]  something like um silence of the lambs or something okay uh well i could either make a girl suit and put  that on or why don't i just mold an attractive girl out of rubber and then just put the whole rubber  girl suit on and then i could walk around like a girl now meanwhile it meanwhile meanwhile they  probably did it and realized all right i don't look like a girl i look like a doll but it's still  better than it looks with you know five o'clock shadow and a crooked nose when the drill press hit  you uh at the factory how much do you think these cost oh really jimmy inquiring are you i would like 
[02:30:00]  to know maybe how much it would take to get me a pretty girl outfit but i'd probably four or five grand  i would think they're probably pretty uh expensive i don't know how they work i don't know how they  mold them i don't know how far down they go let's see are they rubber vaginas rubber ass  you'd have to keep your penis right yeah of course rubber legs rubber ass and a big fat  rubber pot belly so what what was this a documentary on this whole thing i believe it might be a reality 
[02:30:30]  show wow oh man it's being done in england so it's a little difficult to get full episodes and stuff  you know what archie bunker said about england what it's a fag nation no well but you would think  this would be in japan i'm thinking where the hand can be used as a knife  my hand is used as a  i know that's funny yeah it's a little play on it i like it 
[02:31:00]  let's play this monuments no no no delete action let's play this before jimmy leaves my god yes here  we go this is uh dominique no it's donnie no excuse me dominic barbara dominique should have lost a few  pounds before yeah into this plastic woman thing you think it works better with his big fat disgusting  body that's why i want iraq to do this so badly oh god the implications yes and then we just take him

[02:36:30]  pig in the mask they say right it's a big rubber expressionless doll mask yeah they don't say who's  cute and sexy no it was cute and sexy this sociopath exactly this self-hating idiot right wants to be a  white woman  she's really cute she's really cozy i noticed that when i'm a sexy female i get treated completely  differently for people to realize that this beautiful big white woman is really a black man 
[02:37:00]  is mind-blowing yeah some people are naive enough to think that oh in the united states  you have a black president now so there's no more racism i'm like you have got to be  fucking kidding me what under what rock do you live oh boy a rubber one  he's saying under what rock you live look at yourself yeah yeah the mouth doesn't move no  one's thinking you look like a sexy woman stop trying to get into a racism no racism argument when 
[02:37:30]  you're dressed like a piece of plastic if you're wearing a rubber wetson  imagine how that sweats oh that's gotta be great damn it i would love for you to get into a  political debate with a living doll a living doll all right  i can't understand you i've been known to have some rough uh swamp ass oh can you imagine having  swamp ass dress like that horrid what do you think the inside of the mouth of the man  yeah that's gotta be bad you have swamp ass once in a while oh every once in a while 
[02:38:00]  it's very embarrassing especially when when i go for a massage and i know i'm reeking i'm like oh  oh you don't shower first i always shall i try but sometimes you know what are you gonna do  have you ever had your ass stinking during a massage oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah and you know  it stinks oh yeah oh yeah it's rough 
[02:38:30]  what is this guy trying to say about racism uh i that there's there just because there's a black  president doesn't mean that there isn't still a fuckload of racism here in the united states  that's fine so that's probably why you dress because that's probably why he dresses up like  a white woman good for you why don't you explain what went wrong in your childhood that you're doing  this so us parents know not to do that he gets to experience uh plastic privilege when he walks  around like that wonderful very nice yeah oh i'm not racist i have six latino friends i have four asian 
[02:39:00]  friends no all right pause again i know we're pausing a lot but it's a visual like a psychopath  didn't this guy say that he gets treated really nicely when he walks around like a white hot woman  or whatever he said yeah yeah look at this look at all the people on the sidewalk because the camera  crews said all right let's take a walk they're all completely and utterly horrified even that guy  that looks like he can take care of himself look how far away he moves when this this thing walks 
[02:39:30]  down the sidewalk i really think he's so tired of uh being looked at as a black man that he um he  puts this kid up on and even though it's it's a freak show he'd rather be looked at as a freak  plastic white woman because now black man he's controlling uh-huh the reason people are looking  at him it's empowering to dress like a fucking plastic toy i'll see you guys later i gotta get  down oh jimmy it's part tomorrow's on christopher well have a good weekend guys you have a good 
[02:40:00]  weekend too jim my boys all right looks like a haunted house display yeah yeah it's just scary he's an  idiot we should burn him alive and watch him scream from under his mask i bet all the i bet the  plastic dripping off and we go hopefully off his penis it's the love burning plastic fire bug 
[02:40:30]  all right that's here look at that guy the white guy the white guy is horrified move back a little  so and could see this guy completely trying to get out of this monster's way yeah it's a it's a monster  it is a monster he might as well have screamed at the top of his lungs upon trying him but he said  that everyone treats him nice when he's a woman really watch because they see a curvy sexy white  woman it's alarming to see something like that coming toward you you know what it means yeah it 
[02:41:00]  looks like an alien a monster a bank robber yeah yeah a terrorist it's just a serial killer yeah nothing  good no not good i have four asian friends if you can keep count of how many friends of another  ethnicity you have guess what so what are you going to do if you are in a relationship with somebody  and they don't want you to mask mask that's been a very difficult thing to consider if i'm in a  relationship with somebody and they don't want me to mask i think it would be really hard to treat the 
[02:41:30]  relationship going for a very long time i know plenty of maskers who have given up masking for  maskers their girlfriends everything has to have a name yeah i'm always just going to the weirdo  category douchebag all the weirdos why do you have to have make it why are you trying to elevate the  fact that you're out of your mind well some people in the creep community uh have problems exactly uh  they they've been asked to not be creep creepy ghouls my name is dante i i'm a weirdo from the 
[02:42:00]  the bronx yes yes that's what should be said here but what i'm not masking masking what are you what  he's masking when i'm not being a weirdo right  more more for their girlfriends their boyfriends their wives they've purged everything that they  had they threw out all their masks threw out all their clothes and then that urge came back  that that was some people came back years later and it completely destroyed their relationship 
[02:42:30]  secrets of the living doll channel 4.com slash dolls um is that all we got on this we can watch  a you know we can watch a little more this is a trace a trailer for the whole show everyone has secrets  but some are more complex than others it's kind of like an extension of another persona within me that  wants to go out and have fun all right delve into the secret world of female masking there is still 
[02:43:00]  a lot of social pressure to confirm yeah yeah i'm laying out getting a mask on to conform to not wear a  mask what i don't get it at all well the one guy says he does it for fun whatever but i mean  these other guys that are talking way deeper than that that's crazy shits and giggles you think he's  doing it for shits and giggles and the one was laying out to get a tan but yeah she  heat fucking whatever the fuck that we're supposed to call them uh yeah it's plastic it's plastic

[02:47:00]  his rubber suit oh what like what's the way pubes wait so when the when he's technically naked as a  girl meaning taking the clothes off he still has the plastic covering he wants yeah plastic vaginas yeah  oh yeah yeah he shows the the suit to the camera while he's powdering it up so he can get into it  um he shows the the area and said yeah well i i wanted it to look real so i i cut my own hair  uh and glued it to the to the to the vagina can't you just get like wig hair well the vaginas uh 
[02:47:30]  uh uh uh is it functional yeah yeah can you fuck it i don't want to i was gonna say are they  fuckable and you're fucking but there's different there's a there's a scene where they're on the phone  with the with the company that sells the suits and they're they're facetiming and uh the guy is  that you know the woman is asking them what kind of what what what kind of you know what kind of 
[02:48:00]  nightmare what kind of down there they want oh what kind of vagina they want what like big and sloppy or  fucking there's like there's like a pocket that your junk goes in a pocket you what there's a pocket in  the suit that your junk fits in you gotta put your junk in a pocket yeah they have they have like  rear ends that are you know if you want the rear end to be you know right and oh god it's just i  would have a shelf ass man yeah i would have that you just put your junk in your pocket right 
[02:48:30]  wow laughing through his phone oh thanks brother that is terrible all right let me let me go to  enjoy him let me go to uh cory in vegas cory yes cory how you doing boys uh it's one that's really  disturbing um is vanessa and she actually shows you that she put saline injections into his her what his 
[02:49:00]  breast area right and he starts throwing off his tits like it's actually working it's it's really  disturbing at that point exactly laughing oh we might have the clip thank you we have the vanessa clip  let's uh take a thank you cory anytime boys i'm about to uh have what's called saline infusions  where they are going to inject saline into my breast tissue um and they will grow and look like  uh real uh female breasts it looks like it's a zombie from the walking dead pause so he's doing 
[02:49:30]  this to his real skin oh yeah oh my god yeah yeah he must have injected the bags or something on in  his skin oh and then he's pumping them up i don't know we had we had a uh woman that came in and showed  us that that was the weirdest thing yeah yeah she had like um uh i don't even know valves yeah they were  like armpits you're right and then she would fill them up depending on what she wanted to do they 
[02:50:00]  were all she was dominant infecty she hadn't they were the size of basketballs and then she would  explain that she would let some out when she had to when she had to go you know to thanksgiving and  stuff like that she would get them down to a yeah reasonable a reasonable size all right here's vanessa  like yeah sorry breasts i'm very excited are you and so we're just going to inject into the uh into  the breast tissue it's much like an ivy and it pulls in the breast tissue and all right she doesn't 
[02:50:30]  have um he doesn't he two hours later from our last he doesn't have bags he's just injecting  straight into himself yeah because he's going all over the place look straight and there's no rhyme  or reason where that's going look yeah dude oh my god and i gotta say it again if you're going to  go down this road and this lifestyle there's other maskers why don't you get together and figure out a  a mouth that works better than that 
[02:51:00]  maybe like a ventriloquist deal with some adhesive or something so it moves with your chin  i don't know you figure yeah you put your teeth in something on the inside of the thing and make  this thing move a little bit i think i think a fucking george mouth hey you look at my tits  yeah and uh we have completed the saline infusion it it's it feels amazing it's very exciting um 
[02:51:30]  when the saline first goes in the breast tissue is a little bit firm but as it uh sits in your  system it warms up a little bit what this so he's injecting the saline and then the whole  into the breast right into the pecs and then the hole that is made by the he's super gluing yeah  super glue crazy glues it shut super gluing it shut you don't want your fake tit salt water  leaking out all over your suit is this approved by the fda oh yeah it's totally safe it's perfectly  safe all right they did their studies oh yeah yeah yeah okay that's um when you suck that oh god 
[02:52:00]  jesus christ  fuck it's like when you're fucking sucking water at the beach  yikes all right so crazy glue that fucking tit meat shut yeah the tit hole wow this is bizarre  shit people are into yeah that uh sits in your system and warms up a little bit it does get much  softer and but uh so it felt a little bit tight as it was one nipples like down one's off to last 
[02:52:30]  about two or three hours um part of the process requires that you're well that you're well hydrated  it makes the uh the saline last longer it doesn't absorb into your system quite as fast um the last time  i did it it was supposed to last about two or three hours but i was so well hydrated it ended up  lasting about seven or eight hours wow dude i i started dry heaving i'm not i i i that that's  that is too much wow we're in the we're in a business where we see a lot of up 
[02:53:00]  shit that that got me like nauseous that's sick right there what about the the pocket what about  the peeny pocket yeah we need to see the peeny pocket yeah any more clips the rubber vagina looks  like what do you say sam what do you say sam well i'm looking at uh oh we might be able to pull this  off if we got like two grand two grand yeah what do we got well you can get the whole skin suit that  does not include sleeves or i don't think a mask sleeves but that's uh 850 bucks yeah but that's for 
[02:53:30]  an average size person that's true what's a lot for eroc's body it's a large  he's yelling somewhere i know it oh we gotta get him in the suit and then  him with a dildo right what  yeah why don't we why don't we make a shitty version of it like just like out of what i don't 
[02:54:00]  know out of a tarp i haven't thought that far in advance i think we can do it though let's just make  our own shitty version right what if we just stick silly putty to him and cover him cover yeah yeah  cover with silly but it's the same color yeah he did peanut head so yeah yeah yeah except the news  reports wouldn't be good if we accidentally suffocate eroc that's because there's silly  putty all over his face yeah what are you gonna do this is the uh the girdle with the built-in vagina and  asshole what yeah so it's like a does it have the peony pocket though it's uh where i guess it must be 
[02:54:30]  built in up oh see look no go down to the left they're showing you where the penis goes and then  you could still have your vag oh you have to you have to pull the penis up yeah you pull all the penis  shit up and then you got the the vag underneath oh so guys are fucking each other with this you know  it yeah oh god are people weird in the ass too they're having anal sex oh and then the um can you 
[02:55:00]  in the uh god-given one or the uh no in the fake one no wait i'll give you a fake one see but does it  go through the fake one into the real one oh that would be terrific that's what i'm thinking there's no  tube in there no you go through that into the real one dude i swear to god i'm getting nauseous that's  terrible there's something that's just not something so everything yeah isn't but i mean you get used to 
[02:55:30]  hearing about weird this one is like it's so strange i never heard about this one  oh this is just when you strap on it's a strap on vagina strap on vagina that's nice and then then  the old man took his own hair and made pubic hair yeah resourceful so that's nice  either big a or bobo needs to put one of these on maddie from arizona oh wow big a would be great  in one of these bobo could probably sexy it out bobo and you wouldn't need a big pocket for his dick 
[02:56:00]  no not really what was the the furries the furbies i always forget the furries furries okay when we  talked about the furries uh we had a couple guys call in uh-huh this could be the first topic that  we don't have one listener that does this no one does because every time you bring up some weird  thing out there we always get somebody out there calling hey man i do it it's not that bad yeah i do  it it's you know it's freeing why can't photoshop mike make a suit for erock who's photoshop mike i don't 
[02:56:30]  know who that is i don't know one of these people i don't they assume we know everybody they certainly  don in alaska hey one of the uh i he's been i know he's been part of the show or a fan of the show  for a long time we know everything yeah i'm sorry but yeah he does special effects he does like werewolf 
[02:57:00]  or or zombie movies you know on uh independent uh tv and stuff oh yeah is it reasonable  uh yeah he was part of that uh uh the show for uh the uh the gap movie for um  did you have a hair on your banana black one yeah that's not was it but i'm not like that i just i  just take it off and just keep eating that's true what the hell you gotta assume wherever that hair 
[02:57:30]  came from they shampooed this morning you don't gotta assume anything i'm so glad don uh hung up because  i wasn't listening to him at all i wasn't either photoshop mike photoshop mike rules huh what did he do  oh this cough is terrible you want to watch more maskers yeah are you setting up for a day off  tomorrow no no i'm not i'm not i would have taken off today it's just it's just bill is it like a  winter cough yeah i don't know what it is yeah dry hacking i'm constantly 
[02:58:00]  clear the throat out it's terrible yeah let's do one more sound okay yes please sam  oh god another one oh come on how are you getting hairs in your bananas his hairy banana obi's eating  the hairy banana i don't know he likes the hairy banana he admitted it oh boy  anybody how the hell is this buffering what female maskers are a hidden community of ordinary 
[02:58:30]  family men hiding very well they're not freaky people they're just like you and me no they're not  who lead extraordinary double lives oh come on where do i get time to have my husband versus my  girlfriend dressing up in elaborate rubber bodysuits and masks they strive to become their 
[02:59:00]  very own ideal fantasy woman but they don't i used to collect pictures of swimsuit models  not all of them even want to be hot so i don't want to be a nasty hag  there are thousands of maskers jerry we meet at last oh my god they get together yeah they have  conventions they have little parties it's not oh god that's well then if you're if you're the wife  and you have to sit there and go when do i get my husband my husband but not my rubber freak 
[02:59:30]  my rubber freak man wow sorry we need a blast and they come from every corner of the planet  no but fearing scorn and ridicule okay what is that most have kept their secret behind closed doors  i wouldn't walk you know 20 steps down the road just as a doll now some are finding 
[03:00:00]  i bet they'd think the first thing i would think is that some chick is a burn victim and they like came  up with some thing where she could walk around the streets or a monkey ate her face or something  it does look like one of those weird face transplants yeah yeah yeah it looks like halloween period oh  that's fun of course people gonna make funny right because the once again the mouth doesn't move and  and it's not even your real eyes no the eyes are on the thing but i guess you could kind of see through 
[03:00:30]  whatever the fuck it is right because you saw the one guy trying to put away groceries and he was moving  like you move when you do have a mask on where you don't have full perspective they look like after  they wear it for a while they'll have a stiff neck yeah because they were moving around without really  moving the neck around yeah i guess you can't go walking around dressed up like michael myers and  wonder why you're not taking yes that's another thing it's a michael myers does have a michael myers  type of feel to it with a wig absolutely all right finally ready to step out in public  i think that's it to reveal themselves for the very first time yes it's a little overwhelming right 
[03:01:00]  now that's a man that's a man i don't give a fuck what you is oh boy oh shit someone ain't having it  the brothers don't like that no i don't give a fuck what you is i got a very good question coming in  don't from our fine fans really vincent delaware go ahead why is it always guys with this weird 
[03:01:30]  that's true like we put on weird doll masks we dress up as furries we're fucking donkeys  why why can't we just be guys that fuck chicks and act like guys yeah but what what are the what  are the chicks into because you're right a lot of this weird shit it's always uh the male they do  species it's called dicking they just put a little rubber dick on and walk around flop it around 
[03:02:00]  like fucking like meat spin right yeah that's a very good question a lot of this really strange  over-the-top stuff is always always men it's probably all men that have been conditioned to not be  emotional and they have all these emotions inside so they get weird motions whereas women can be  emotional but i think some women are furries i guess yes there are female furries yeah right  yeah opie good luck with that kid of yours yeah it's gotta be frightening this is more frightening 
[03:02:30]  than drugs yeah i'm doing the best i can trust me and then i get pissed off by that video that  we didn't talk about today which one the black kid oh right yeah that's like some adorable man  there's some things my kid does it's hilarious and stuff but you have to squash it yeah because you  you don't want to fucking raise an animal it's a little black kid fucking cursing and they're  they're just egging the kid on calling a little bitch and a cunt and fucking right and having the  kid curse and stuff and having the kid cars and then i guess the police posted it on one of their 
[03:03:00]  facebook pages and the police got in trouble right for showing you know i'm glad they posted it  it's like shut up and hopefully they take the kid away and maybe the kid has a half a chance of  doing you know having some kind of normalcy too late is this the video this thing was just like  what the really i'm in the same world as this i'm working my ass off at home not sleeping properly  and trying at least trying to do the right thing i'll raise my kids and then you could just have a kid 
[03:03:30]  like this yeah fuck that's just ghoulish or goulash where uh and even if you do all the right things  there's no guarantee your kid's going to be all right that's what's frightening too no but guaranteed  this kid will not turn right but you're making it you know more of a guarantee that yes he he isn't  when you just don't do anything right and then there was another kid they they're not sure if the video  is real yet the nine-year-old kid in uh where was that russia or something that they found on the 
[03:04:00]  street and he's bragging that he's been drunk for years and doing drugs and yeah and then there was  another fucking story here in new york on 48th street close to us where uh the four-year-old's dead with  fucking cigarette burns and stuff crazy it's like it's horrifying it's not a nice place anyway the video uh  uh i'm gonna just bump down now we should go back to masking the video camera off the diaper clad 
[03:04:30]  child exchanges a load of curse words oh they're not gonna yeah yeah but at least they have the whole  story oh yeah that's good enough we gotta go home anyway i got to do that's true at least they'll have  the story i i'm sure people have seen this anyway yeah they're really being uh a little vulgar and what  is it the uncle that's taking them on was a young child perhaps two or three years old in a disturbing  profane war of words with at least three adults they seem irritated over a fallen chair 
[03:05:00]  the child flips his middle finger at the camera flips it in a way like he knows how to do it  properly you know yeah yeah obscured exchanges at least 35 swear words with the adults in the  one good vocabulary second video say 35 say suck my dick that's good that's how you can't fight 
[03:05:30]  say you're a you're a you're a bitch bitch they discuss sexual matters even apparent gang affiliations  oh what is he from what is he from what i'm from dude slam no what are you from something's different  what are you who you're from say three times  the video was posted on the website of the omaha nebraska police you're a ho 
[03:06:00]  bitch uh i have nothing to say it's just it's it's and then i saw a real bummer and then i saw a video  last night that was uh the complete opposite of that i think it was ellis sings elvis did you see  that little kid no in the car seat singing um elvis presley with uh a red and that was just adorable 
[03:06:30]  ellis ella ella ella it's a kid what do you think it's jason ellis there are other people jesus christ  yeah that's the little kid yeah maybe just adorable and the kid just reminded me what you said about  your daughter saying daddy all the time with that this kid won't shut up with that  yeah that's about the age of my daughter she just yells daddy all day to me daddy daddy that's all this 
[03:07:00]  kid's crazy and then daddy puts on elvis and the kids literally start singing elvis songs hi baby  daddy that's exactly what i'm going through kids are mental patients he's probably about 15 16 months  old if i had to guess i think you're right like 14 i want to see the elvis part yeah yeah go forward a 
[03:07:30]  little bit we had a fun show today one end on it all right all right  that's exactly what i'm going through at home every day that kid sings look away look away look away 
[03:08:00]  dixieland really yeah away it's a little different than i hope 
[03:08:30]  why do they keep saying hi  they have nothing else going on in their lives it's nice to be celebrated to that extent though  i love it i love having somebody walking around just cheering for me yeah i'm not gonna lie i love it  but after a while you're like okay okay okay i'm here it's real right i'm just amazing the kids  so into singing like the faces the eyes shut it's like yeah it's rocking this baby the shape of her head 
[03:09:00]  and the way she moves her mouth and eyes and her pronunciation completely that's rolling oh my god it's a little  roll look it's a roll look it's a rollin hallelujah singing hallelujah 
[03:09:30]  and the father's just driving come on who puts this on in their car i know  it's some epic shit going on yeah he's a pretty dope kid yeah that's an epic fucking elvis song  absolutely yeah and that's only half the kid just starts wailing and then there's a part where the  drums go and the kid takes her arm and starts going nice whatever it is you can't even tell 
[03:10:00]  at that fucking age 16 months yeah singing elvis singing elvis that's awesome i kind of like  bitch and ho though you like that kid but yeah let's just say what's my name nigga  all right what what who'd you rep it i don't know why well you could tell that's a there's a father  there there's some guidance there that's the all that's probably not getting all about why just keep  the cycle going i don't know because i had cycles in my life and and it's allowed and as a parent though 
[03:10:30]  i know the cycles of what happened to me growing up and and i'm i decided no because it's literally  allowed i don't understand why you wouldn't try to do things differently the stuff that bothered you  as a kid yeah it doesn't seem like it seems like a no-brainer you think it doesn't seem like the guy  who's raising that or talking to that little baby sees any problem with the way his life is  probably doesn't think he needs to change anything baby has no idea that's what's so sad 
[03:11:00]  and that baby was tops too that we were looking at yeah yeah the other one if you say anything you  know to then it's a problem though you can't say like this there needs to be something done  in in there there needs to be some kind of guidance a lot more criticism and then criticism just breeds  you know you're of racist you're this that and then nothing gets done so the thug culture yeah thug  culture is what that video is completely that was the debate of uh and this is adorable culture oh look at  that baby she loves elvis she loves your dad exactly nice all right we're gonna go home now 
[03:11:30]  all righty and i think uh mm-hmm we have nothing else to say right no i i think i'm done i'm done  yapping so we're chatting so just hit something we did all right we did something we need a big  fucking out yeah just fucking hit something  the opie and anthony show has gone to a close stay tuned to reflect like relive and get the story  behind the story of the finest moments of today's show sam roberts opie and anthony post show begins in
