<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a detailed and raucous recap of Anthony Cumia's weekend party.  Initially planned as a small gathering with E-Rock, the event spiraled into a massive bash involving numerous coworkers, including two "hot interns" (Jackie and Sydney), Troy Kwan and his "bitches," Steve from Bayshore (a frequent show caller and caterer), and several other friends.  The party, held at Cumia's house, featured a caterer, a dinosaur prop for Vine videos, a leaky pool, karaoke, a poker game, and DJ Danny Falcone, whose excessively loud music prompted a noise complaint and a visit from the Nassau County Police Department.  This visit yielded several memorable moments, including Steve from Bayshore's highly intoxicated attempt to unlock a police car with his keys, followed by vomiting.  The interns even hosted their own impromptu talk show during the party.  Other key party events included Roland's near-drowning due to his inability to swim (partially caught on video), and a confrontation between Pat's date and Dennis, one of Cumia's poker buddies.  The hosts played various audio clips and recounted numerous anecdotes throughout the show from callers like Steve and attendees like Roland and Sal.  The party's success, including the loud music (especially the song "Shots"), dancing girls in bikinis, and numerous guests, were highlighted, alongside the repeated calls to the police, which the hosts anticipated.  A particular incident involving a screaming argument and crying female guest was also discussed, as was E-Rock's passive behavior and Roland's repeated requests for more food.  Denny, the DJ, recounted bringing out hula hoops while speaking to the police, further emphasizing the chaotic nature of the event. A drunk party guest attempting to enter a police car was also mentioned. Troy Kwan, who attended but left early for a gig, was mentioned as a guest, as was an uninvited intern who watched remotely.

The show then transitioned into a discussion of the Tony Awards, initially met with disdain but later praised for the talent displayed, particularly Neil Patrick Harris' performance.  This segued into a scathing critique of *America's Got Talent*, targeting the perceived lack of talent, the judges' passivity (except for Howie Mandel), and Nick Cannon's hosting.  A detailed analysis of a levitating act from *America's Got Talent* followed, culminating in the hosts revealing the trick's mechanics with the help of a caller and online research.  The hosts also discussed black audiences' reactions to magic, making several generalizations on the topic.  This was followed by a discussion of Steven Singer Jewelers and a commercial break, which was immediately followed by a bit featuring Uncle Paul's reminiscing about a childhood photograph, and Captain Louie's bizarre encounter with a mooring ball mistaken for a submarine near the Statue of Liberty.  Opie's upcoming movie premiere appearance and a review of Seth Rogen's *This is the End* (specifically praising Danny McBride's performance) followed, along with a discussion of box office numbers, the Edward Snowden NSA leaks, political ideologies, the definition of terrorism, the Bilderberg Group (including audio clips of Alex Jones confronting a Bilderberg member and a BBC discussion), a failed viral magic trick video, and a successful magic trick gone wrong.

A lengthy segment dedicated to Alex Jones and his Info Wars broadcasts, conspiracy theories, and presentation style ensued, comparing his tactics to those of Jesse Ventura.  Ventura's lawsuit against Chris Kyle's widow and Kyle's death were also discussed. The discussion touched on the Bilderberg Group's alleged Nazi origins and involvement in creating the Euro, as well as government surveillance and harassment of conspiracy theorists.  This segment also featured an in-studio interview with UFC fighter Rashad Evans, covering his fights (particularly against Jon Jones), their post-fight relationship, Evans' support for gay rights, and anecdotes about other UFC fighters like Dan Henderson, Roy Nelson, and Mike Tyson.  The legalization of UFC fights in New York was also discussed.

Another segment heavily featured the aforementioned Cumia party, focusing on the interns' experiences, including interactions with other guests and a potentially creepy individual who obtained their phone numbers.  Russell Brand's appeal to female interns was also mentioned.  Sam Roberts discussed the awkwardness of selecting his own audio clips and joked about his career aspirations.  The segment included anecdotes about the party, such as Roland's near-drowning, the discovery of Anthony's Lego collection by Eric, Roland's incoherent ramblings about the party, Anthony's ex-girlfriend Jackie needing pediatric care, and Troy's aggressive driving in a Prius. A conflict between Sal and Denny was also revisited.  

The show concluded with a discussion about an upcoming party, speculating on who would be invited (Sam, David, Roland, E-Rock, etc.) and their potential reactions, including a humorous anecdote about Denny's comment causing confusion for David.  Upcoming television appearances (Anthony on Red Eye, Sam Roberts on Michelle Beadleâ€™s show, and a segment on Inside Amy Schumer) and a review of *The Purge* were also mentioned.  The show's closing moments included a promotion of the gay-themed audiobook, "Fifty Shades of Gay," and a comedic bit featuring audio of the fictional character, BoboCop, interspersed with frequent use of homophobic slurs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  New York City, 6 a.m.  An out-of-control satellite radio show is being broadcasted to millions of Americans.  At the controls, Reg Hughes, a father.  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it at me?  This is it.  The three men make up The Opie and Anthony Show,  a popular radio program known for its cream style of entertainment 
[00:00:30]  and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is different than any other radio.  No telling what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's not like radio. It's just like hanging out.  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations  and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  Insane.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real. 
[00:01:00]  Real people. Real excitement.  This is The Opie and Anthony Show.  What happened?  I was looking at somebody trying to parachute off a building.  Oh, yeah?  You can see this smacking up against the side of the building.  Will that be our video of the day?  Oh, it could be. Could be.  Did he pass away? 
[00:01:30]  I don't think so. It looked like he was hung up there.  Yeah.  Did all right.  We'll get more info on that later.  Morning, everyone.  Good morning.  Hope you enjoyed your weekend.  Oh, who does it, man.  Oh, who does it, right?  No one has their time off.  A little fun and hijinks with friends and fam.  Why not?  Exactly.  Yeah, that was, uh, I had a fun time, obviously, at the house.  A little party over the weekend. 
[00:02:00]  You recall Friday, the planning phase of this.  Yeah, you threw a last-minute party.  It kind of got together really quickly, because I realized very, very quickly that me and E-Rock just hanging out at my house.  I don't know how well that would go.  So, well, E-Rock, if you remember his wife.  What happened?  Well, E-Rock's wife was having the dildo party.  Right.  And we're now calling it the dildo party.  The dildo party.  And that was a Saturday, I gather.  So, Friday, during the show, the end of the show, E-Rock was very sad that he was going to have to find something to do. 
[00:02:30]  And I was like, you know what?  Wait, you threw the whole party for E-Rock?  Yeah.  No.  So, I invited E-Rock over the house.  Right.  I was like, E-Rock.  There's no way you threw the party for E-Rock.  Well, that's how it started.  You had another motive, sir.  And then I'm like, what?  What was your motive?  I need to know.  Was it that?  What?  That's why you really threw the party.  Are you kidding?  No.  You would never throw a party for E-Rock.  You're lying.  A party was well overdue. 
[00:03:00]  Okay.  A party was well overdue at my house.  The weather, you know how the weather's been.  You want me to believe you had a party just for E-Rock?  Well, it was my mistake, because I invited E-Rock to be nice and everything.  Seriously, I did.  I was like, you know, let me get E-Rock away from the dildo party he doesn't want to be  at and stuff.  And then I realized, I started, like, through my head really quickly, I started playing out  the scenario.  Me and E-Rock hanging out.  The long, awkward silences.  There's a lot of lies going on here.  What? 
[00:03:30]  Oh, man.  You don't like E-Rock enough to throw him a party?  It wasn't a party.  E-Rock, do you think he put that party together for you?  No, he put that party together because of me.  Well, that's true.  I don't believe that either.  It was like, it wasn't a party, though, at first.  It was just like, all right, E-Rock, come over.  Sure.  It was just E-Rock coming over, a little play date.  Right.  And that's why there's a party.  And then I started thinking, like, maybe I ought to get a couple more people over as  a buffer so we can, you know.  Right.  I'll talk.  And then the more people I started inviting over, the more I realized it was going to be 
[00:04:00]  like, oh, no, now I got to invite this person, that person.  So then it just started, and then I had the, you know, the idea to invite more people from  work.  How did the hot interns play into this?  They had nothing to do with the big party planning?  I got to be completely honest with you.  It wasn't at the forefront of my mind at that point.  That wasn't the ulterior motive.  At that point.  That wasn't the ulterior motive.  All right.  Fair enough.  It was very nice to have them over.  They're very fun.  You can take them or leave them?  They were cool. 
[00:04:30]  But, E-Rock, you can't?  Put it this way, all right, I'll be completely honest with you.  I've never had any intern over my house.  That's what I'm talking about.  They could all go blow.  We've had interns off and on for, I don't know, close to 20 years now.  Exactly.  You've never invited an intern to anything.  Never.  What, am I going to have fucking David over my house?  But you threw a party for E-Rock.  I get it.  I threw a party for E-Rock.  And the hot interns just happened to be there, too.  They just happened.  I think, you know what?  They were walking the halls on Friday. 
[00:05:00]  You make perfect sense.  I get it.  They were in here for the ribs and stuff, so they kind of heard this happening.  Why are you rude, right?  To not invite them.  Rude.  What, I did almost go to Handsome Rob's house.  Yeah, remember?  During his party.  That never happened.  Oh, my God.  I forgot all about that guy.  Yeah.  Whatever happened to him?  He just, remember, he was a weirdo who lied a lot.  We realized he was lying about the whole party.  Of course.  But he knew how to play golf in the end.  And he invited you to play golf.  Oh, that's right.  That didn't happen, either.  No.  He sort of invited me to his father's fancy country club. 
[00:05:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was a sort of invite.  All right.  So I believe you.  Well, they...  You threw a big party for E-Rock and not the hot interns.  For E-Rock.  The interns showing up at your house for the first time in 20 years.  It just worked out for me.  No, I know.  I understand now.  You explained it perfectly.  I didn't see the one, though.  I saw two, but I didn't see the third one.  Oh, the guy with the greasy hair?  Yeah.  What happened to him?  Why wouldn't he just invite the whole intern class?  I guess there was an oversight on the invitations that went out that day. 
[00:06:00]  Okay.  He was literally standing outside the studio.  Was he?  Yeah.  With puppy eyes.  See?  I didn't see that.  He was hoping he would be adopted.  Oh.  And taken home.  Yeah, that wasn't happening.  So he didn't get the invite.  No, he didn't.  What happened there, you think?  It just slipped your mind?  Yeah, it was an oversight.  Okay.  Next time, maybe.  Oversights happen.  You know, next time.  So E-Rock's wife, dildo party.  E-Rock at the compound.  Right.  Yes, yes, yes. 
[00:06:30]  Perfect.  And it was other people, though, you know, obviously.  Troy Kwan showed up with some bitches.  More than one bitch?  Oh, fuck.  Of course.  Like three.  He's got his main one.  It's amazing.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's got his main one that he makes believe they're just, you know, casual.  He's got his main squeeze.  It seems like they're pretty tight.  His main squeeze.  And she's very, very cool.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I like her a lot.  She's a lovely girl.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Lovely girl.  No, I like her a lot.  She's very, very sweet. 
[00:07:00]  Very attractive.  And beautiful.  She's very, very, she's easy on the eyes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And down for whatever.  Oh.  And she knows how to move.  And, well, everybody was in the pool.  It was nice.  It was fun.  She was in the pool?  Oh, yeah.  Troy Kwan's in the pool.  Everyone's in the pool.  Yeah.  Our own Roland.  Wait, you're fast-forwarding, though.  I know, yeah.  Why are you fast-forwarding?  I don't know.  I'm just so excited about Roland.  You want to just get to the Roland part?  He's the greatest guy to have at a party. 
[00:07:30]  He really is.  He's so loud.  Right.  Just yelling, slobo.  Iraq, I regret the day I just came up with that.  I didn't think that one was going to stick.  I'm sorry.  Who knew, right?  I'm sorry.  Who knew?  I really am sorry.  Lies.  Lies.  Oh, boy.  What's more of a lie?  That I'm sorry that I came up with slobo, or that Ann threw a whole party for you?  I need to know.  They're both equal. 
[00:08:00]  All right.  So you got the whole party together quickly.  It was very quickly.  Ange was at the house listening on Friday and just going like, she's looking at the radio  actually going, no, no.  Having a panic attack.  She knew, you know.  Right.  She's the one.  She's got to jump into action.  Yeah, yeah.  We got Steve, my usual catering guy, there behind the grill and did an amazing job.  Where's he working now?  We met him through the show, right?  Oh, my God.  Where is he working?  I should know this, right?  He came in to cook for us one day.  Oh, yeah.  He used to come in at K-Rock and do our breakfast and everything. 
[00:08:30]  He was great.  He's amazing.  And you've known him ever since.  Yeah, yeah.  Anytime I need somebody over there to party, cater something, you know, cook, he's the guy.  Right.  So you got him to cater.  Got him to do it up.  We got the two hot interns and the ugly one wasn't invited and the whole thing was thrown  together for Iraq.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What else?  Well, the dinosaur was a big hit.  There was a line of people waiting to take pictures with the dinosaur.  To do their Vine video with the dinosaur. 
[00:09:00]  Exactly.  A little Vine video, some photos.  It was amazing.  Everybody took photos with the dinosaur?  Everyone was taking photos with the dinosaur.  That's so weird because you only posted one photo of people with the dinosaur.  Oh.  Well, that was my photo.  That's the only picture that made it out loud.  That was my photo.  You were the two hot interns and the dinosaur in the background.  But everyone else was taking pictures in front of the dinosaur.  Well, I didn't see everybody else, but there was a line of people.  Two interns and two dinosaurs.  Yes. 
[00:09:30]  Indeed.  Jesus.  All right.  We'll just assume that everyone else took a picture in front of the dinosaur.  You only posted one picture.  Whether they want to post them or not, that's their prerogative.  You didn't get pictures with Sal and everything in front of the...  No, not really.  What about you and Iraq?  Not really.  No.  Considering Iraq was the reason why he threw the party, you would assume that there would  be a couple of pictures of you and him being pals.  See, you're misinterpreting this.  Iraq wasn't the reason I threw the party.  I've got to say that. 
[00:10:00]  It wasn't.  But the reason I threw the party was to cover up that it was just going to be me and Iraq.  You know, because I had invited Iraq over to get him away from the dildo party.  But you would never just invite him over.  So already in your head...  No, it was kind of a spur of the moment thing like, you know what?  I'm thinking to myself, it's a Saturday.  I've got nothing going on.  Iraq doesn't want to...  You know, he's not just going to drive around his neighborhood until the dildo party's over.  So why not come over?  Iraq, you think he would just invite you over to his house?  Without a motive? 
[00:10:30]  Um, sure.  I don't think you would care if Iraq was stuck at a lemon party.  All right, we'll buy it.  What the hell?  It just turned out to be a great opportunity to have a party.  So the dinosaur was in place.  You've got Steve cooking.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  What else?  The pool was very nice.  The temperature was perfect.  Crystal clear blue water.  You had to fill it up with some hose water?  Because the leak is still not fixed, right?  No, the leak is not fixed. 
[00:11:00]  All right, but you made sure there was plenty of water before the party started.  There was plenty of water.  And the monsoon we wound up having Friday actually got the pool filled up to the...  The brim.  Right to the brim.  Perfect.  Yeah, yeah.  But the heaters were working.  It was wonderful.  There was various places that outside, downstairs, the karaoke, the poker table, the inside just  chit-chatting, watching some TV.  Every bit of the house was being equally represented. 
[00:11:30]  It was very successful.  Safe to say the party was boring until Roland showed up to really pump it up?  Well, they showed up pretty early.  Oh, all right.  They did show up pretty early, which was good.  But he really pumped it up.  He pumped it up.  Roland knows how to just bring the whole thing to go.  He just sits there and yells and screams at people.  He does.  He sits there.  Not in a bad way.  Drinks heavily.  Oh, man.  Yeah.  Can we play this?  That's one of his...  Go home, DJ!  Danny, play the hits!  Now!  Go home. 
[00:12:00]  Go home, DJ!  Danny!  That's when Danny Falcone, of course, DJ, with his hard drive of hits, he showed up.  Out of nowhere?  Well, no, I invited him.  You got him.  I needed him to DJ the party.  You hired him to DJ?  Oh, yeah.  Once the late night festivities really got rolling, I figured we needed somebody there  to rock the party.  Some tunes.  Yes, to get up there.  And boy, he had just come from a communion party out on Long Island, so it was close. 
[00:12:30]  Right.  So it was very easy for him to get over there in his suit.  And set up?  And set up.  He had the lights going, and...  I saw that he, uh...  There he is.  I saw the Vine video where he was using his catchphrase.  He was using his catchphrase.  Is this a hot mic?  Hot mic.  Hot mic.  Oh, it was fantastic.  And I bet you everyone just started laughing and laughing.  Oh, amazing.  And then I heard some people dancing.  Oh, yeah, people dancing.  What do you mean some people dancing? 
[00:13:00]  You barely pan to the left.  What do you mean some people dancing?  Well, there's...  I wanted to get Sal in frame.  Yeah, you get that.  You got the...  You got three lovely ladies.  Yes.  I was going to say three interns, but two hot interns and another very hot individual.  Yes.  And then you slightly pan to the left to almost show the rest of the party.  Well, I have to show...  Your eight seconds of the Vine video, seven and a half were on the hot girls, and a half  a second for that guy. 
[00:13:30]  Well, Mikey Cuffs.  Right.  And then there's Sal in the background, and...  But usually if people are going to show the party, they would kind of move along.  Why would I want to...  You know, if I did that, then people would complain, dude, why didn't you just stay on  the girls?  So I figured I'd help out the people that were watching.  Do you realize that there were more people at your party than those three girls?  Uh, yeah, I heard.  Okay, all right.  Do you know how many interns we've had in here that have wanted to get invited to one  of Aang's parties?  Oh, right.  These interns have been here for one week. 
[00:14:00]  A week?  Well, they made an impression.  One week.  They were very nice.  One week.  And by the way, everyone...  They had a great time, I believe.  I'm sure.  They said everyone had fun.  And it was...  They weren't harassed or anything.  They got there and home very safely.  It was very good.  I made sure, you know, everything was good with that.  I didn't want to be, you know, like Travis kicking people in the nuts.  And then another Vine video where it just shows the three girls. 
[00:14:30]  And a very quick shot of Denny playing the music.  It's, uh...  Yeah, look.  And then there's Sal.  Did you see Sal?  No.  Oh, well, he was there.  What we're looking at is a slow pad to the left where you see hot girl, hot girl, hot girl.  Sal!  Denny, bye.  And then the Vine video starts over again.  Well, you know, you really don't understand...  You don't understand how to pace that eight seconds yet, I guess.  Well, it's six seconds.  It's very difficult. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, you were probably pacing for eight.  I was.  See?  I ran out of time.  I needed to get Denny on there.  Is it six seconds?  Is it eight?  Sometimes it's seven.  Oh, it's very difficult to gauge.  Yeah.  Very difficult.  All right, well.  But, uh...  Oh, look at that.  All right, here's another Vine video.  I'm in there.  Oh, wait a minute.  Where it's just you and the three girls.  Well, no, there's Sal in the back.  Sal in the back.  Well...  How much attention to Sal, dude?  Oh, boy.  This video obviously has nothing to do with him, and he's popping his head up in the background. 
[00:15:30]  He loves it.  No, Sal's good for the video, though, because he's like, hey, look at me and Sal.  Hey, I know.  That's what it was all about.  So it's Anthony and the three hot girls.  That's what it was about.  So this is just a series of videos of Sal dancing.  Sal dancing.  He loves having his hand up like he's directing traffic style.  And Denny with his music too loud.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, the second Jimmy got there, he, like, showed up.  He said hi.  Went right over to Denny to tell him to turn that shit down.  The cops are going to come.  How loud was it? 
[00:16:00]  It was so fucking loud.  Dude, I sat for a little while, and I'm like, this is really, like, I couldn't hear who  I was talking to.  Yeah.  So I asked D-Rock, is the music loud, or am I just fucking, am I just being a fucking  old lady?  He goes, no, it's loud.  And I asked Roland, he goes, yeah, it's really loud.  And Roland said it was really loud.  D-Rock, how loud was the music?  It was echoing off Ant's house back at you.  Oh, my God.  So his speakers were shooting towards the house.  If you're sitting in the middle, you got it at both ends.  Oh, more partying.  Wait, more Vine videos of the party, but once again, you see the three hot girls. 
[00:16:30]  Oh, well.  And nothing else.  So now there's Denny in the background.  Certainly not complaining, but I just don't, I don't really get a feel for who else was  there.  It was for Denny.  I was getting Denny in frame there.  Oh, I see.  And when you say three hot girls, two of the three you're referring to are our interns.  Oh, yeah.  If they're hot, they're hot.  Well, you know what?  I wanted to show, because they were having a great time.  Look, they're dancing to Denny's music and everything.  I just wanted to... 
[00:17:00]  But you could have filmed Denny at any moment, but you decided to film him at the point where  the three girls were dancing right in front of them.  You got to get the action in there and everything, you know?  But you want to show Denny was there.  Exactly.  I want to show Denny.  I think that's him.  I can't really tell.  Yeah.  He's way in the back in the darkness.  Oh, there he is.  But the music was loud.  Do you do the move where you invite the neighbors so then they feel like they can't call the  cops because they were invited to the party?  Or you don't even invite them anymore? 
[00:17:30]  No.  I don't think I ever have.  You should invite them knowing they'll never come over.  But then they won't pick up their phone and call because then they feel like they were  part of the party.  Here's my fucking take.  Right, right.  Here's my take.  That's why you do that.  My take is, look.  You warn them there's a party.  Hey, if you want to come over and have a burger, come on over.  It's summer.  And then they don't fucking pick up the phone and call the cops.  It's summer.  I have a few of these per year.  Saturday night.  They could go fuck themselves.  Do you think your neighbors hate you? 
[00:18:00]  They fucking hate me.  We pulled up.  I pulled up with a friend of mine and we could hear the music from a block away.  And I'm like, they hate his guts out here.  I'm like, this is a nice Jewish neighborhood.  There are doctors and attorneys.  And nice, responsible people.  And then there's just this fucking well-lit Sodom and Gomorrah in the middle of the block.  Holy shit, really?  I know.  You could not not hear that music.  That was really loud. 
[00:18:30]  You've got a really nice spot out there, but the houses are a little too close for what you do.  I had to weigh it out, you know?  When you're in your house, you go in your backyard, you can't tell that the houses are close.  But when you're throwing a party, it's pretty obvious.  I know.  Wow.  It was crazy.  All right.  Oh, that's Pat from Wynaki.  Right?  Where?  Well, over there.  Wait, is this another?  This is a different Vine video, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh.  That's a guest.  There's Pat.  Where?  Pool.  I blinked. 
[00:19:00]  Pool.  I think I saw Sal for a second.  Wait, where's Pat?  And there's Pat.  Where?  Oh, I see.  I almost saw him.  Sal.  Sal.  Hot girl dancing, hot girl dancing, hot girl dancing.  Pat.  Pat.  Pat.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  See how that worked?  That's nice.  There's Denny in the background.  It's a Denny video.  Denny.  It's a Denny video.  Wait, what?  Look at the lights all over the place.  Denny brought his lights.  And his hard drive of hits.  Is he a good DJ?  Yes, of course.  Denny's great.  I would recommend him.  Did you have to pay him? 
[00:19:30]  I threw him.  Money wasn't discussed.  But at the end of the night, I tossed him some cash.  Greased him up a little bit.  I tossed him some cash.  Nice.  It was very successful.  Look at that.  It's just amazing.  Well, there's a picture of...  What happened there?  Well, we had taken a picture.  I guess it was me.  Who was it?  Me, Jackie.  And then there was somebody else in the picture.  And then she was like, oh, let's get a picture together. 
[00:20:00]  I'm like, oh, okay.  So, you know, we just had a nice little embrace and picture.  You're hugging her really tight.  What?  That's an intern you've only known a week.  I haven't seen a lot of intern pictures like that.  No.  Who's the other guy?  Jackie, is the guy here today?  A lot of intern pictures.  We ought to get him in here because I'm sure he wants a picture with Anthony.  Should we recreate this photo with the guy intern? 
[00:20:30]  In 20 years, I think this is the only picture you took with an intern.  It could be.  Very strange.  You don't even hug Opie.  No.  We've never touched in 19 plus years.  I figured it's time I pay attention to the intern.  You know, there are interns that people say, remember intern like Bob?  And I'm like, who?  What?  I don't remember anything.  I figured I better start remembering the intern's names.  So, you know.  Now I know.  What's her name?  Jackie.  Oh, you know that one? 
[00:21:00]  Yeah.  Oh, good.  And Sydney.  Wow, that was.  Yeah, yeah.  You usually have trouble with the intern's names.  I sure do.  Yeah.  So, Jimmy went and asked Danny to turn down the music.  Did he turn down the music?  A little bit, but I asked after I asked other people.  Not enough, right?  I'm like, it was fucking loud.  It was loud.  It was loud.  It was cranking loud.  But what time was it at that point?  It wasn't the hour.  It was probably 11.  Maybe 10.  10.  10.  Yeah.  But it wasn't the hour.  It was like I was just talking. 
[00:21:30]  I was sitting at the table talking to Eric and Roland and Liza.  And I asked, is that?  And they all said, yeah, it is.  So I confirmed.  And I asked Anthony.  He said, yeah, it seems fucking loud.  Yeah, yeah.  So then he turned it down just slightly.  A smidge, yeah.  A smidge, yeah.  Didn't make much of a difference to the neighbors, probably.  Uh, no.  No.  Not really.  No.  I love it.  What time did the cops come?  Because I only stayed for like an hour.  Well.  Wow, we jumped ahead here.  That.  We were saving the cop thing, but.  Well, the cops.  The cops showed up. 
[00:22:00]  Well, it was weird.  Because they didn't just show up, show up.  The, uh.  I was doing a live from the compound show.  Right.  We cranked up the compound cameras.  We had it on the karaoke stage.  Mm-hmm.  And then I, uh, decided, let's crank up the studio and just leave the door open and the  mics on, and anyone that wants to go in could just sit down like a little confessional and  have a show.  Nice.  And hold a show.  It's not posted.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  It's not posted.  Uh, it was one of those live, you know, things, and that's it. 
[00:22:30]  Mm-hmm.  Um, so a bunch of people were going in and out, and I decided I'm going to go in there and,  you know, have a little fun with some, uh, people, so we were doing just that.  And then my phone rings.  My phone rings, and I'm like, hello?  And I hear, uh, Anthony, it's, and then he tells me who he is, and it involved, of  the Nassau County Police Department.  They know you personally?  He's got my number.  So I'm like, oh, hey, how you doing?  He goes, well, we'll be out in front of your house in a few minutes. 
[00:23:00]  Got a little noise complaint.  Oh.  I'm like, oh, God, all right, we'll be right out.  It was me.  I called them.  You called the cops.  Jimmy couldn't take it anymore.  Jimmy called the cops on me.  I was trying to have a chat.  I couldn't.  Jimmy called the police on me.  Jimmy couldn't take it.  All right.  So they show up for a little noise complaint.  No big deal, right?  What time was this?  Um, this was much later.  Much later in the evening.  Um, I can't be sure of the time. 
[00:23:30]  Two-ish.  I can't be sure of the time.  Not really sure of the time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Um, but, uh, yeah, they, they, they, they, he called me.  Right.  I then went outside and noticed that the music had been shut off by that point anyway.  So they were showing up, but it was already, you know, Denny was already, he was done.  Yeah.  He was like packing up.  He packed up his hard drive of hits.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And his obnoxious lights, he got the hell out of there.  So two cars pull up.  Yeah.  You know, a couple of guys get out.  Yeah.  We're just, you know, and I, I had known, I knew that, you know, one of the guys met the 
[00:24:00]  other guy and we were talking for quite a while.  Mikey, you know, NYPD Mikey came out.  And we were just talking, we were talking about like all kinds of shit.  And then that, that at this point is when Steve from Bayshore, uh, comes staggering out  my front door.  Now I'm, there's two Nassau County.  There's me and Mikey Cuffs.  There's a picture of Steve from Bayshore.  He's hammered.  Wow.  He looks hammered in that picture. 
[00:24:30]  Hammered.  Wow.  Hammered.  So he, um, he staggers out the house.  Right.  And, and he's doing that thing where he puts one foot forward, leans back.  Right.  And then he's walking and, and we're, we're all looking at him now.  The cops start kind of chuckling like that.  And then I, I hear jingle, jingle, and I see him pull his keys out of his pocket.  I'm not kidding.  Holy shit. 
[00:25:00]  No way.  He pulls his keys out of his pocket and he's walking toward the street.  So I just, I start laughing.  I'm like, like, ah, he goes, Steve, if you're thinking of going somewhere, I go, it's probably  a real bad idea.  Right.  At this point, he doesn't even acknowledge, he can't hear anything.  He can't see anything.  How close were, did he walk by you guys?  Directly.  But we were on my grass and obvious cops.  They weren't, yes, there were two Nassau County cop cars, two cops, and him staggering toward 
[00:25:30]  the street with his keys out.  Walking right by all this.  With his keys out.  Oh my God.  It only gets better because.  If he's up, he's got to call the show.  As he continued walking.  Yeah.  Oh, he'll be no help with this because he doesn't remember anything.  Wow.  Wow.  As he's walking with his keys out, he then stops to put his key in the lock of the car door.  This was after you told him this is not a good idea?  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:26:00]  Wow.  But he's putting the key into the lock of the passenger side of one of the Nassau County  cop cars.  No way.  Yes, fucking way.  We're stunned now.  We're just sitting there.  He's rocking back and forth, trying to fucking put the key in the Nassau County cop car.  Oh my God.  We're roaring laughing at this point.  It's like, Steve, what are you doing?  And then he goes like, and then staggers across the street to his vehicle, where he 
[00:26:30]  goes to the passenger side, unlocks the door, gets in the passenger side and shuts the door.  Now he's sitting in his passenger seat and now we're just laughing.  So we continue talking for a little while, the cops, and we're obviously keeping an eye  that he's not trying to drive anywhere.  Uh, so he, uh, we, we go, we, we better, me and Mikey go, we better take care of, you  know, Steve, make sure he's all right and everything.  So we go over with the cops. 
[00:27:00]  The cops take the flashlight, put it through the window.  Steve just kind of looks at you like, what?  Oh, wow.  Something completely unintelligible.  Uh, we open the door to get him out.  At which point, um, Steve, uh, pretty much does the old Grauman's Chinese Theater cement  footprint things in his own vomit outside the, uh, the vehicle.  Wait, he puked right outside the car?  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was puking outside the car and he stepped in, um, he stepped in the, uh, the puke.  Uh, yeah. 
[00:27:30]  So, so we had him go on the, you know, the grass and everything and kind of wipe his foot  off and, and clean it up.  And then we got him inside into one of the bedrooms and, uh, put a little puke pail next  to the bed.  And that's where Steve from Bayshore slept it off until the next morning where he left  a nice note on a paper plate and, uh, and took off.  Did he puke on the, uh, no, no, he didn't.  He didn't.  He was, he was good.  He was done with that.  But when, when he tried to open the cop's car door, drunk off his ass, I was fucking 
[00:28:00]  laughing my balls off.  I've counted three viral videos already in this party.  Oh.  I'm up to three.  Well, then, uh, I go back downstairs, uh, and the, the compound facility has been, the  life in the compound facility has been taken over by a lot of people.  I believe, I believe, um, Sydney and Jackie did a little show.  They did a little talk show where they were taking some calls. 
[00:28:30]  The interns doing a talk show from your house?  The interns did a little live from the compound.  After a week.  Talk show.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's nice.  What'd they call it?  It was nice.  I don't know.  They were just down there, you know, doing a show.  He he he and having fun.  But everybody was.  A lot of jealous interns.  Former interns listening to this show right now, wondering what they had to do.  They should have called it, fuck the rest of y'all.  Are they both here today, the interns?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Should see if they had a good time. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, I would think we should ask if they had a good time.  We certainly will.  I'd be very interested to hear their perspective.  Yeah, we'll, we'll move on to that.  That'll be stage two of this.  It's amazing.  So you go down in the compound, um, people are doing a, a show.  Yeah, yeah.  Uh, at some point, I guess, Fred from Brooklyn did a show.  Um, who else was there doing, uh, a lot of people.  Um, uh, Wendy was there and she did a show with, I think, Fred from Brooklyn.  And it was crazy.  You girls did a show for a little while, right? 
[00:29:30]  I did it with Danny.  Oh, you did it with Danny.  Yeah, I did it with Danny.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  That's right.  Danny, Danny Ross.  Remember Danny Ross?  Uh, he works at Rockstar now, but he, uh, worked, uh,  here for a while.  Uh, Danny decided he was going to get on and take some phone calls.  I didn't know what was happening because you need headphones to hear the calls.  Right.  But we could hear Danny.  Here's all I heard coming out of that studio for a good half hour.  Maybe even longer.  Yeah, well, fuck you too, asshole.  You fuck. 
[00:30:00]  Bullshit.  Fuck you.  What do you do?  Fuck you.  No.  I had it there.  I didn't want it to stay anyway.  Fuck it.  Oh, yeah, you cocks.  Oh, fuck it.  That, that was Danny's call-in show.  Wow.  People calling him and lambasting him and him yelling back.  Yeah, his excuse was that it's 1.30 on a Saturday and all you're doing is watching me,  so why are you doing this?  Right, right, right.  That was, that was another thing that he was, he was talking about.  So you got to join Danny on the, uh.  Yeah, we were kind of just sitting in there, but we had to watch all the people do karaoke 
[00:30:30]  and that was just becoming way too much.  It was becoming brutal.  Yeah, that, yeah, we couldn't watch them anymore, so we just went and flipped in.  Was the karaoke good?  Not, uh, not one of the banner karaoke nights.  Not as you get later into the night.  Yeah, yeah.  It usually gets better, right?  Well, not when you get the likes of, uh, the girl that Pat, uh, brought over.  Was, yeah.  She was the one who was going.  Oh, yeah.  I didn't see her there.  I was, I, oh boy.  Yeah, she was there.  Yeah.  Well, what's that about?  Wait, wait, wait, there's too much going on here.  I want to, I want to.  Were you there for when she, uh, got a little rambunctious with, uh. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah.  Dennis?  Yeah, yeah, not Danny.  Not Danny.  Dennis, uh, one of my poker buddies.  Dennis.  Yeah, Dennis is one of my poker buddies.  Uh, and, um, he was down there.  It was a big poker game at one point going on.  You played poker for a little bit, Sydney?  I did.  And how'd you do?  I, I was up for a little while, but then I realized I don't know how to bet in poker.  Like, I just know how to play poker, so I lost it all.  It wasn't great.  The interns are losing money in poker at my house.  You got to cover their losses. 
[00:31:30]  It wasn't our money.  I don't know whose money it was.  No, no.  You don't know whose money it was?  We were playing with fucking, who are you, fucking Mogry?  Try Chimster and the interns.  Everyone plays on the house.  The interns will kick your teeth out.  Try Chimster.  I don't know whose money it was.  I don't know whose money it was.  It was a wonderful world to live in.  It was great.  That's right.  You know.  All right.  Doing shows at the compound.  Doing shows and playing poker with somebody's money.  It was great. 
[00:32:00]  Nice.  It was a lot of fun.  What'd you guys think of the compound and the party itself?  That house was ridiculous.  Oh, was it?  Yeah.  Great.  It was awesome.  It was fun, man.  I think everybody had good.  Everybody was very respectful and nice, right?  Yeah, yeah.  That was very nice.  We can't have, you know, shenanigans, hijinks.  When I walked in, it was very dark where I walked in.  No, it wasn't.  Oh, light-wise.  He walked in to the side.  To the side.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And there's a little sidesteps there.  And I see Anne's girl.  And I didn't recognize you. 
[00:32:30]  But it's fucking...  I was Harry Handshake.  Hello.  God bless you.  Glad you came.  Be safe.  Be safe.  Come on.  Take care.  Yeah, Jenny's very petrified of his job at that point.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  God bless.  God bless.  God bless.  Well, it's a touchy situation.  It's a very touchy situation.  You've got to be very careful when it turns around.  Well, yeah, that's just it.  I mean, you know, obviously that's why I wanted to make sure everybody was being very nice.  And there was nobody invited that was going to be an asshole. 
[00:33:00]  So maybe Sal, but he was under control.  Sal is fine.  Yeah, Sal is fine.  Hold on.  We've got Steve from Bayshore.  Oh, shit.  We've got to get him on the line.  Mr. Steve, how are you, sir?  Steve.  Well, good morning, gentlemen.  Hi.  Do you realize you did any of these things that Anne just described?  Well, let's just say this.  I kind of passed out at the house and then woke up, and I'm like, I've got to go get my toothbrush.  That's all I remembered.  I had a toothbrush and another shirt in my car. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, good thinking.  So this is what I'm going to stumble at doing.  And I'm like, well, why are there cop cars there?  It did barely register.  But I'm thinking, you know, I'm not thinking I'm going to go drive.  So I'm like, oh, there's nothing wrong.  And I realize that I'm just stumbling like a drunken reader.  You are a stumbling motherfucker.  And you try to get into the cop car, Anne.  Yeah.  Yeah, you...  I have no clue. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah, you walked over to the Nassau County car, the passenger side of it, with your keys out,  and you were staring into the window of the cop car, trying to work the key.  Yeah, well, let's just say I was drinking a bit.  Mr. Mikey Cuffs certainly provides alcohol at your...  Mikey Cuffs.  Yeah.  You're not allowed to have an empty glass.  Yeah, yeah, you're not allowed.  He will come up to you and make sure you have a beverage in hand.  Yeah, I mean, I was having a fantastic time, and then sometimes I just lost it. 
[00:34:30]  It all hit me at once.  It certainly did.  You know.  And I woke up, it was about 6.30, and I'm in my little...  In that little room.  Yeah, we put you in the little room with a little puke bucket next to the bed.  Like you were homesick from school with the flu.  Oh, it sure was eventful.  It certainly was.  Thanks for assisting me that way, Anne.  Oh, no problem.  You know, got to take care of the guests. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah, of course.  Right, right.  Yeah.  Well, you know, we were sad when I first got there, me and Cuffs go downstairs to the bar,  and we went to get some Guinness.  I'm like, I'll just drink Guinness all the...  You know.  Yeah.  Well, the keg wasn't attached.  So he's like, eh, what do you have?  I'm going to have some Jameson.  Oh, yeah.  Going from Guinness to Guinness to Jameson.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, that turned out to be a big mistake, because I drank that pretty much longer.  I had about three shrimp to eat.  Yeah, there's plenty of food, and like, yeah, you should have eaten more. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah, yeah, I think so.  I think so, so I could have thrown up a better rainbow outside of my car.  That is true.  It looked like Campbell's Chunky Chicken Soup.  Oh.  That's terrible.  It is horrible.  Yeah, as I came out in the morning, I noticed that, and saw a poor Joe Curry, who seemed to  have an even worse night than me.  He was just sitting in the pool, shaking his head, going, oh, no, no.  Yeah, yeah, Joe Curry.  When I got up, Joe Curry was passed out on my couch. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  And then, it was probably well after 8 a.m. or 9 a.m., I don't even know the time, but  then I'm thinking, no one really knows how to shut off the Life on the Compound show.  So, I went downstairs, it was just broadcasting an empty chair for hours.  Like, if you tuned in, you would just see that for hours.  I bet you got good numbers.  Probably did.  Now that empty chair is famous.  Yes.  It's actually doing better than us on the podcast. 
[00:36:30]  Nice.  Well, I hope you had fun, Steve.  Well, I did, and sure.  People told me I had fun.  Oh, yeah.  It was something.  Yeah.  Well, thanks.  Yes.  All right, sir.  All right, Steve.  Very happy.  I'm going to, yeah, just drink some more water.  Yeah, yeah.  Hydrate.  I saw Pat, but I didn't see this other person.  I didn't go downstairs.  I just stayed in the backyard.  Is that where she was?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She's downstairs, and she was singing karaoke. 
[00:37:00]  Is she the hot blonde that Pat's been kind of hanging with lately?  And she was, I guess, singing.  It was like this weird caterwauling thing going on.  That's her on the left, yeah, on the left of that picture with Steve from Bayshore.  Yeah, there she is, talking with Logan.  See, you like black people.  Well, of course.  Logan's a pisser. 
[00:37:30]  I didn't quite like that picture.  No?  That picture bothers you?  Yeah.  I think it's labeled, uh, at my fucking house.  Jesus, why can't it just be a nice picture?  Because it just can't be.  Steve, I'm going to let you go.  If you remember anything else, call back, all right?  Big A.  All right, Steve from Bayshore.  Big A groping somebody.  Oh, Big A.  That's great.  That's wonderful.  Every time Big A's in a picture, he looks like in, uh, in the fucking, the ring.  Remember they would look at the pictures, and it would, like, start to, like, uh, get 
[00:38:00]  because it was, like, all blurry.  Yeah.  Could you go back to that picture?  Yeah.  By the looks of it, the girl is enjoying that.  Well, of course.  You can tell by her body language.  She's accepting.  Well, let me tell you.  She's accepting that.  The guy's got a gentle touch, I gather.  Yeah.  I have no idea what that's about.  Yeah, so, so, Pat from Anaki brings the girl, and, uh, she's up there, uh, doing something,  and I don't know exactly what happened, but, uh, Dennis was sitting at the poker table,  which is just off to the left of, uh, the, the karaoke stage, and, um, he said something 
[00:38:30]  about maybe that it was loud.  I don't even know what it was, but she got a fucking, just a bug up her ass about it  and starts lambasting him.  Fuck you!  Go fuck yourself, you fat fuck!  And, and just yelling.  And he could, he could have unloaded on her.  Oh, my God, he was being very merciful.  Very merciful, indeed.  But, um, it, uh, she then got right in his face. 
[00:39:00]  It's a party!  Oh, I know, I know.  Oh, no.  Oh, yeah, right in his face.  She's confrontational.  Yelling.  Yeah, very confrontational.  Very loud.  Wow.  And then to see poor Pat from Anaki go over and, like, gently put his hand on his shoulder  and go, okay, well, uh, all right.  So out of his league.  It was, all I was thinking was Fredo and, and, you know.  Oh, yeah.  That's why you don't never, never marry a wife.  Never marry a professional eater!  Never marry a professional eater! 
[00:39:30]  Because, uh, uh, Pat was out of his league as far as trying to, you know, reign her in.  Right.  Was she being mean to Pat?  No, she was just kind of not acknowledging that Pat wanted her to kind of chill.  Yeah.  So everyone was kind of looking?  Oh, everyone was looking?  I was, I had my fucking phone out.  I was recording this.  I was recording this and fucking turn it.  And, of course, I had a few in me, too.  So I was turning it around every so often going, world star hip-hop!  And then, you know.  Can we hear some of the audio? 
[00:40:00]  I don't have it on this phone.  I don't have it.  I know.  Terrible.  You're going to bring it in for tomorrow.  Yeah, I'd love to hear that.  I do have some of the yelling.  The yelling was bad?  It got uncomfortable.  And you could tell it was just probably the alcohol, because after a few minutes, it turned  into her crying and hugging Dennis.  And there was just, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry!  Yes.  Yes!  Exactly.  Really?  Exactly.  That's what it was.  I didn't, oh. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, yeah, I know.  Ooh, creepy.  That's just how I like him.  Once the tears flow, I fucking start filling up.  Yeah.  And Pat was controlling the whole situation?  Not an ounce of ability to take care of business.  Was he trying to, like, laugh it up?  Like, oh, you know.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, he was.  It was very uncomfortable to watch.  I got her home, comforted her.  Yeah, comforted her.  That's okay.  Comforted her.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was that. 
[00:41:00]  Roland.  I saw Roland walking around.  We found out something about Roland that we didn't know.  Yeah, let's get Roland in here.  He's rolling in the hall.  Yeah.  He's coming in.  I think he's coming in.  What time did the girls stay until?  We're out.  Like three.  Like three, yeah.  Jesus.  Yeah, yeah.  Any other thoughts from the party?  We had car service to get them to and from.  You know, it was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  So I know no creepers were there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was fun.  No creepers were there?  No creepers were there?  Everything.  Are you kidding me?  No creepers were there. 
[00:41:30]  I want to become more self-aware.  No, he felt safe.  Oh, what is that?  Roland and Sal in the pool.  It was very homoerotic.  And Roland in the pool with his Springsteen shirt on.  Yeah.  It's a fat people roll.  Yeah, we have the shirt.  You're holding Sal, like cradling him in the water.  Roland, how was the party?  It was fun.  Yeah.  Your thoughts on the party?  Delicious food. 
[00:42:00]  Booze.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Shanigans.  Good music.  Good music.  Good music.  Denny.  Denny.  Denny.  Yeah.  And Roland.  Is Denny here yet?  Yeah.  Then he should come in, too.  We've got a little Denny take on this whole thing, too.  So, Roland, I never knew this.  You don't swim.  No, I do not.  Roland can't swim.  Oh, my God.  Seriously?  Yes.  He was in the pool.  I asked Anthony, where's the line before he did?  It's like, where's the line?  You have to figure out where the deep end is always in a pool. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  And then I was like, what happens if you go in the deep end?  And he's in the shallow end.  And he goes like, oh, you see me go like, ooh.  What is it?  And he starts splashing.  He goes like, ooh.  Ooh.  You never learned how to swim?  When I was a kid.  You're Mexican.  You're Mexican.  Exactly.  How'd you get here?  I know.  You just never had the desire to learn how to swim?  Well, I just, I mean, the last time I swam was probably I was like fifth grade, sixth  grade.  That would be scary.  Yeah.  And then Sal pushed me to deep end. 
[00:43:00]  And I was like, ah.  Yeah, yeah.  I cleaned it to the rocks.  When we found out he couldn't swim, there was this little effort there to get him into  the deep end.  What are you, crazy?  I know.  They're very cruel.  And Anthony goes, we'll save you, but first I have to vine you.  Yeah.  I go, we'll save you, but it's going to be six seconds of horror and terror for you  because we're not going to save you during the vine video.  Just know that after six seconds, you'll be okay.  We'll be in there.  Yeah, yeah.  I cut myself because they pushed me in the deep and I grabbed the rock like a. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, yeah.  He fucking was like just on the edge of the pool, you know, and kids like aren't sure  and they have to grab on.  You can't swim.  Holy shit.  Yeah, yeah.  So he was Mr. Shallow End guy.  Yeah.  He was entertaining the shallow end of the pool.  Where's the video of him being pushed in?  Who had that one?  I don't think.  I don't think I had it.  Yeah.  There was a bunch of things going on.  Oh, they were having fun.  Troy was showing off.  He was taking one of the big floaty cushions, putting it by the deep end, running, jumping 
[00:44:00]  on it, doing a little surfing.  Yeah.  Other dinosaurs.  The chicks.  Oh, yeah.  There was a line of people taking pictures with dinosaurs.  That's awesome.  People called him crazy, but.  Love the food.  Big hit.  Good food, right?  Yeah, really good food.  Did anyone go in the jacuzzi?  Yeah.  After a while, people were in the jacuzzi, yeah.  The Sal was jumping out of the jacuzzi to the pool.  Oh, yeah.  Which is a little dangerous.  A little dangerous?  Because you're going to jump in the deep end.  The deep end.  A little scary for you, right?  Yeah.  No, thank you. 
[00:44:30]  I can't believe you.  We can't say it.  That's so.  When he said it, I thought he was kidding.  But he wasn't kidding.  No.  There's a.  What's up, Sal?  Sal.  Who was never invited to Anthony's when he was an intern.  Oh, my God.  Oh, that's true.  Yeah, interesting.  Absolutely not.  He had to graduate.  Was that your first time at the compound?  It was awesome.  That was the first time there?  I had such a good time.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was fun.  It looks like it.  You're in all the Vine videos.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  All the pictures.  Sal got it to like every video.  Yeah.  I don't know how it happened. 
[00:45:00]  Maybe you were hanging out with them.  Yeah, you were like fucking mosh girl.  Sal, how long did you intern?  I interned for maybe like eight or nine months.  And then how long have you been an employee?  A little over a year.  And ladies, how long have you been interns?  A week.  Oh.  Already doing your own show at the compound.  What would happen?  Nothing strange here.  No.  Oh, not at all.  Well, you gotta, you know. 
[00:45:30]  Sal, your thoughts on the party.  I had a great time.  And Sirius is one of the best hosts I had.  No, we understand it's a good time.  We know all that.  But what are your thoughts on it?  Ant's got an amazing house.  That, it seems like the ultimate party place.  Just to invite the light crew over and just fucking blow it up.  Just have some fun, you know.  Fucking, yeah.  Having some fun there.  A little drinking.  A little drinking.  A little eating.  Great food.  Yeah.  What was the silliest thing that happened?  Oh.  What was the silliest thing that happened?  Silliest, yeah. 
[00:46:00]  Oof.  Hmm.  You guys were pretty much the patio crew.  Hold on.  Yeah, the synchronized.  Me and Sam are rolling our eyes.  Are you trying to be a broadcaster?  What?  Are you trying to be a broadcaster in the end?  I don't want to be on the air for sure.  Okay.  All right.  That's very obvious.  Okay.  Oh, shit.  Because we're rolling our eyes.  It's like you're, I mean, Ant's told ten great stories so far.  You don't have one good story from the party.  All you're saying is the food was good.  The music was good.  So I was part of the patio crew.  Yeah.  And that was, you know, you didn't really see. 
[00:46:30]  You saw a lot of Roland.  Right.  I mean.  But then Sam asked, what's the silliest thing?  You have nothing.  Like, how about the context?  A highlight.  A highlight from the party.  I have no idea.  Roland probably just picked me up.  We were drunk and Roland picked me up.  We started doing synchronized swimming at one point.  I was like, what the fuck is going on?  Roland and Salden synchronized swimming in the pool.  Okay, there you go.  And Roland can't swim.  And Roland can't swim.  So that was, uh, we wanted to get him floaties for his arms so bad to get him in the deep end  with some floaties.  That was funny.  He's petrified of that deep end. 
[00:47:00]  How was Denny?  Denny was great, but Denny didn't hit the fucking post once.  Oh.  Oh.  Now, Denny.  I asked him numerous times that night.  Just do it on one song.  Everyone wants to hear it.  Ant wants to get a video out of it.  I know.  Nothing.  What, he kept missing or he wouldn't do it?  He just wouldn't do it.  Well, it wasn't the, uh, the right time to do it.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  We were just keeping the groove going.  Keeping the groove going.  Keeping the groove going.  Denny was there.  The Hard Driver Hits was there.  You were a gracious host, and it was nice that you hired the Nassau County Police Department  as security.  That was nice. 
[00:47:30]  Uh, yes, yes.  You, uh, you put out the old bat signal for the police.  I was talking to the gentleman working the barbecue, and I said, what time could you play  music till in this town?  He goes, oh, two in the morning.  I said, oh, outdoors?  Oh, yeah, two in the morning.  I said, okay.  You know, I do a lot of block parties around.  The guy behind the grill told you that.  Yeah, usually.  So, he looked like a figure of authority, and I said, well, usually, you know, when you  do a block party, 11 o'clock is the time.  No, two in the morning.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Is that accurate?  Two in the morning?  Yeah.  It's one in the morning, and I see no one around. 
[00:48:00]  Everybody's downstairs.  And then I said, where's Anthony?  He said, well, he just answered the door.  The police came.  I said, oh, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  And that was fun.  Yeah.  That's your cue, though, huh?  I have to get some louder speakers, I think.  The lights were a good addition, too.  I kind of liked that.  A real party atmosphere.  We got some great videos of, fine videos of people having a good time there, Danny.  You did.  You tore it up, I must say.  Jimmy said the music was too loud.  What?  Jimmy said the music was a bit loud.  Yeah, it was a little loud.  I'm sorry.  That's okay. 
[00:48:30]  You know, when you're behind there.  You think Jim was a square when...  No.  Not a square.  A square?  Jim's a square.  That's funny.  No, because he wanted to talk.  He was there with a lady friend.  Sure.  And he was talking to some guests at the table.  Yeah, and it was, you know...  No, but you're there to rock the place.  I just have, you know, one switch, on or loud.  There it is.  Watch out.  There it is.  It doesn't really make sense.  On or loud.  It would be off and loud.  I'm off and loud.  Yeah, but whatever.  What's on then?  Yeah, on is... 
[00:49:00]  You just switch to on then.  Because then it doesn't go off.  What's the off button?  Oh, no off button with Danny.  Quietly on.  That was good.  All right.  I do remember hearing the Shots song so loud.  It was very loud.  And everybody was just yelling shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots, shots.  And the neighbors were really...  I wish I could pan through all the neighbors' houses.  Oh, I know.  The conversations that are happening.  Maybe you should just invite them the next time.  No.  It's the same bitch.  You do the fake invite.  It's the same bitch that fucking calls the cops all the time. 
[00:49:30]  But they're never going to show up.  But at least they'll feel a little more guilty when they do think about calling the cops.  Right.  Which one is she?  Danny knows.  How far from your house?  She's the one that's directly to the left, if you're looking out in the backyard, kind  of in the corner by the jacuzzi, back that way.  Okay.  But I just fucking...  Like I said, the cops called my phone first before they do it.  So I pull a Doyle Hargrave with that one.  Loves on my side!  I play cards with the chief of police!  It's weird that everybody was singing, like, shots. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because there's a Vine video of shots.  Yeah.  Yeah, there it is.  I just don't see everybody in the Vine video.  No, we see three hot girls.  Well, there was, you know...  And there's two of which are in the room.  There's sort of an effort to pan laugh at the end of the Vine video.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was nice.  It was.  It was a lot of fun.  Nice people there.  It was.  Girls dancing in bikinis.  What else do you need?  All right.  What else do you need?  Everyone...  You know what?  Aside from just that little thing with Pat Fumunaki's girl there.  You know where she screamed at the guy and then broke down crying?  Yes.  It was very peaceful.  Everyone has a good time. 
[00:51:00]  It's not like, you know...  I went out with one of those once.  Oh, my God.  Oh, I think everybody has, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't ignore...  Oh, it's just terrible.  You can't ignore some obvious problems because they're so...  Yeah, you're so sexy.  ...so hot and sexy.  Yeah.  I've been there.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But, you know, no fucking...  Good for Pat.  No people had to be ejected and then come back later and shoot the place up.  Like some parties, you know.  You know what I'm saying.  Had to go there.  Well, yeah, I did. 
[00:51:30]  Almost made it a whole hour.  I did.  Almost a whole hour.  We officially made the hour.  No, it was good for fun.  This is the start of the second hour.  Oh, good.  That it came out.  That it came out.  Cool.  The ugliness came out.  Yeah, we made a nice hour clean.  Yeah, I know.  It was just fun, fun, fun.  I don't know.  Party in, party in, party in.  It was.  Party in, party in.  Everyone had a good time.  I was trying to think of, like, the wrap-up.  Where were you, O?  You couldn't make it?  No.  No.  I know.  People were asking where it was.  You got the big invite this time.  The direct invite. 
[00:52:00]  Everyone got the invite.  We had to.  I've had a few invites in a row now.  There'll be more.  There'll be more invites.  Beginning of the summer.  Got to have some more of these.  You girls obviously are welcome, you know.  It was a lot of fun.  They did, you know, they had a good time.  Everybody was cordial.  I just didn't want to be a game piece.  I knew what this whole thing was about, you know.  From the get-go.  Preposterous.  It was about the hard intern, so not really the staff.  Right.  It's preposterous.  The weird thing is, this was like, to me, I thought this was Nagelfest at the conference. 
[00:52:30]  There isn't one image.  There's no pictures of E-Rock, even though this whole thing was put together because of E-Rock.  If I didn't see him in person, I wouldn't believe he was there.  Let me tell you something about Eric Nagel at a party, or this party, or whatever it was.  Eric might not like this either.  Eric plays off the too-cool-for-the-room guy.  Oh, no.  Yes.  Eric.  Fucking boo.  What's that about Eric?  He's sitting at the table, let's say, holding court, although no one's paying attention. 
[00:53:00]  No.  But he's sitting at the table, like, yeah, I'm here if anyone wants to, you know.  Join me.  But Eric's not like the, you know, he wasn't very proactive.  If anyone wants to seek his counsel.  Like everyone else.  He's there.  Everyone else is having fun and doing things.  There's all kinds of different areas of the house that, you know, different things are  going on.  But Mr. Nagel.  You didn't get involved with any of the activities?  Not really.  That's why you don't see him in any of these pictures.  E-Rock, what's up?  You were just sitting there, just enjoying the food and the music and just checking it 
[00:53:30]  out?  Yeah.  What's your vibe?  And I enjoyed the pool.  The pool was very nice.  Oh.  You jumped there?  What was that girl you were fooling around with?  Jesus.  The sound.  Jesus, Jimmy.  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wait, you jumped in the pool, though?  Yeah, I went in the pool.  Oh, boy.  Did you do the shirt or no shirt?  No, I did the shirt. 
[00:54:00]  Oh.  You did the shirt?  What?  Yeah.  You didn't have to do the shirt.  They were like the caddies from the movie Caddy Shack.  A kid sucks in the gut when Lacey Underrolls walks by?  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  How's that song go again?  Oh, whatever.  There's a music that plays, too.  Yes, there was.  A sax or something, right?  That was it.  No need for smut.  Yeah.  That's a great picture.  Oh, that's a, yeah.  I don't know. 
[00:54:30]  E-Rock, yeah, he went in the pool, I guess.  You're saying E-Rock was a dud at the party?  Well, I won't say a dud, but, you know, you won't really see any pictures or hear any  interesting stories that involve E-Rock because he was just kind of, you know, it's just kind  of there.  I was enjoying it.  What was the silliest thing for you, E-Rock?  It was mostly watching Roland.  He would lean over, like, he'd be sitting at the table on the patio, and he'd go, excuse  me a second, in the middle of a conversation, he'd lean over and just, like, stick his hand  out to Steve, and he's like, can I have some more shrimp or some more chicken? 
[00:55:00]  So Steve would throw a whole bunch of stuff up there, and plates were being brought over  to Roland to sample, and...  He was like a king over there.  Yeah.  Did you indulge Roland?  Did you indulge?  You're a sweet ass.  And then you can scream at anything at Anthony's party and it's welcomed.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Nothing.  He kept harassing Denny because he was taking so long to set up, and Roland was eating.  Were you distracted, Denny, by...  That happens all the time.  Yeah, yeah.  A rambunctious kid at a bar mitzvah.  When you go into a party that's already going on, sure. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah, that's true.  Come on, come on, come on, start the music, what are you going to play?  Oh, boy.  I played a Bruce Springsteen song for him, so...  You did, you did, I heard that.  Which one?  Cadillac Ranch.  Good tune.  Cadillac Ranch.  I don't know that one.  Good tune.  Yeah, good tune.  Cadillac, Cadillac, shine...  Roland, you know it, sing it, right?  No.  No!  And I even slipped on a little disco kiss when Jim came out.  I heard that.  That's true, yeah.  Jim comes in.  It was very thematic because...  I was made for loving you, yes.  Jim comes in, and then all of a sudden, Kiss is being played. 
[00:56:00]  Roland's there, and we get some Springsteen.  Great DJ.  It was.  He pays attention, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  E-Rock was there, so we got some fucking Weird Al.  What Weird Al song would you have liked at the party?  Oh, I don't know.  Did you have any Weird Al on the hard drive hits?  I might have had Eat It.  Eat It?  Well, that would be appropriate, too.  That's a good one.  I want to, you know, rip on the guy.  He was there kind of relaxing.  Of course, he was.  He was just chilling.  Yeah.  You know, barely wanted to be known he was there. 
[00:56:30]  Denny didn't do the full setup, though, because we were helping him take some of his equipment  in.  He has all these props and games in his vehicle that he would bring in.  At one point...  Why didn't you bring those in, Denny?  All of a sudden, I just turned the music on, and everybody started dancing, so I didn't  need to throw those out there.  That was an awkward moment, also, when I was out front talking with the Nassau County  police guys, and I hear, hey!  And I look up by the driveway, and there's Denny with an armful of hula hoops going, I 
[00:57:00]  forgot to bring out the hula hoops!  And I'm just standing there with the cops like, oh, fuck.  Oh, my God.  He did.  And an armful of hula hoops.  Did they get used?  We didn't need to use them, because the party was just going, you know?  No.  Sometimes you...  No pisses the neighbor.  They call the cops, and they show up, and nothing is done to their liking in the end.  I knew the cops were coming before they even showed up.  Oh, boy.  So you can, you know... 
[00:57:30]  I get that phone call.  You turn the music off.  Right.  Everything's cool by the time the cops show up.  Right.  Except for the fact that they've got a drunk guest trying to enter one of their cars and  drive home.  Yeah.  Which, you know...  Well, he says he wasn't trying to drive.  Yeah, he was just trying to get his toothbrush.  His toothbrush.  In the cop car.  Yeah, I wish he would have grabbed the shotgun.  Yeah.  Steps and vomit.  What a fucking...  He really did.  Yeah.  Well, you know...  Very good.  Other little things, I guess, but that's pretty much the bulk of it. 
[00:58:00]  I'm sure other things will come up during the show.  Yeah.  Yeah, it was good.  On the big party.  Troy Kwan and the bitches.  Oh, yeah.  We'll get his...  He brought his bitches.  We'll get his take on the party when he gets here.  It was nice.  They were gone by the time I got there.  I think he had a gig.  Yeah, he had a gig to go to.  He was just kind of tag team DJs, even though he didn't DJ or anything.  But, yeah, it was fun.  It was a good one.  Oh, please.  Great time.  Please.  When's the next one?  Here's Troy.  ASAP.  Troy, how was the party? 
[00:58:30]  Troy.  How you doing, man?  Good.  Yeah, you had to leave a little early, right?  Oh, shit.  It was a fucking blast, man.  We had a great time.  Yeah, we did have to leave early, but...  Yeah, it was fun, man.  It was just starting to really get warmed up, like when we were taking off.  Yeah, yeah.  What time did you leave?  About 8 o'clock.  Quarter after 8.  What time was your gig?  I had to be there at 10.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah, we were like first guys in the pool kind of a thing, too.  You know, very early on, getting that pool.  Troy likes, you know, pool hijinks with the chicks. 
[00:59:00]  With the chicks.  How many bitches?  I had three.  That's pretty sick.  But next time, if you give me a little more heads up, I'll round up a ton.  I'll bring a whole busload of bitches.  Just don't take them home at 8 o'clock.  That's the worst.  Well, I could reschedule my gig, but it was literally like...  That's a huge tease.  Yeah, exactly.  It's awful.  It was the day before.  He was like, oh, let's do this.  It was very short notice, because I was saving E-Rock from the dildo party.  Of course. 
[00:59:30]  That's why.  Yeah.  He had the party.  We all know that now.  Exactly.  Yes.  Please.  Yeah, it was all about E-Rock.  I wish the other intern was here today.  Yeah.  Oh, poor guy.  I heard he...  Did he call you guys?  Yeah.  He got in touch with you guys?  Yeah, when we were doing the compound show, he texted me in.  So at 1.30, he was still up watching again.  He was watching.  Oh, he was watching the party that he wasn't invited to.  Oh.  And you know what?  He would have really loved the...  He's been on the after show once, and he came to me and said, hey, Sam, on the after 
[01:00:00]  show today, did I do all right?  Oh.  So like, he really cares.  He would have been down in that studio, taking calls.  A lot of calls were coming in.  It was amazing.  Yeah, a lot of calls.  The phones were lit the whole night.  Wait, you had your headphones on, right?  Yeah.  What were they saying to Danny?  Were they just insulting him?  Yeah, a couple of people were just like, insulting him like, this, the show sucks.  Why haven't you been on in so long?  But I don't know.  I mean, we got a couple of good callers, but I mean, nothing...  Most of them were aggressive?  Too exciting.  Yeah, most of them were aggressive.  Oh, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  They were very...  Just wanted to hate.  Yeah, they wanted to hate.  They were haters.  Because they were home alone on a Saturday night.  They were drinking Haterade.  Yes.  They were home alone.  Exactly.  They were home alone on a Saturday night.  Exactly.  Watching other people have fun.  Yeah.  Are you inviting the intern to the other one?  The next one?  Both of them, of course, are cordially invited.  No, I didn't mean them.  This is the third.  Oh, that guy?  What's his name?  I don't even know.  Yeah.  What is his name?  Or is it going to be one of those things where all the regular crew knows that you're welcome 
[01:01:00]  to come back?  See, when I put out an invite, a lot of times, I don't have time.  I don't have time to look individually at everybody.  So I just put out a Twitter or put out on the air here, hey, everyone that you know who  you are that gets invited to all my parties and stuff, just, you know, show up.  And they're like, oh, cool.  And you guys are obviously on that list now.  I mean, you know.  Until the day you die.  So, yeah, yeah, that's pretty much how I put out the rest of the summer's invites. 
[01:01:30]  That's it for the summer, then.  It could be it.  Have you ever had to tell someone they're not one of those people anymore?  Yes.  You have?  I usually get somebody else to tell them.  Mikey Cuffs.  Really?  I get Mikey Cuffs to tell them, you know.  Wow, you've had.  Because I love the invite.  You just throw it out on Twitter.  Like, you know who you are.  But I was thinking, wait, you know who you are, but there's got to be someone in there  that fucking blew it.  I've had some people show up.  The guy that showed up with two prostitutes to my house, that one party, I guess it was Halloween.  Sale. 
[01:02:00]  How'd you do that?  No way, I think I remember.  Yeah, yeah.  The blonde, the tall blonde, the big blonde.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actual prostitutes?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You never had him come back?  No, no.  Wasn't he there again or no?  Well, he was, like, at another party after that.  But then, you know, I started talking, especially talking about Mikey Cuffs.  And I'm just like, I can't, you know, that's a little shady.  Why did he show up with two prostitutes?  He's a good guy.  Yeah, yeah, maybe he's a good guy.  Oh, please, that's the best thing anyone's bought.  He's going to be there.  Oh, I was.  Oh, you were there.  Yeah, I think there's this misconception that I want, like, complete, out-of-control debauchery. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  I like controlled debauchery right now.  So, you know.  He assumed that's what you wanted.  Yeah.  At your party.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe not.  Somebody would bring bitches.  Not prostitutes.  Now, Troy Kwan brings, like, respectable girls.  Troy, you wouldn't bring prostitutes.  You would just bring bitches that are down for whatever, right?  We had to brief these brawls before we even got there.  And they were perfect.  They were great.  They had fun.  They were very in control.  They were respectful.  No, yet the only kind of out-of-control girl was the girl that Pafferminaki brought over with her. 
[01:03:00]  I hate you.  Fuck you.  You fat fuck.  Oh, my God.  I'm sorry.  Let's hug and cry it out.  Was it just awkward for everybody?  It was so fucking...  I'm in my own home recording.  Yeah.  And any time, like, people looked over, I had to come and almost hide the phone because  I was embarrassed that I was even recording it.  It's my house.  I was like, okay, sweetie. 
[01:03:30]  Just the gentle touch on the shoulder, and she's kind of, like, shrugging off his touch.  Shooing him away?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There was no stopping her.  He didn't have control of the situation?  Wow.  He didn't walk over there and go, stop.  Not really.  Not really.  Fucking, uh, yeah, yeah.  Siegfried and Roy had more control of that tiger.  It was...  Yeah, we've all been there.  It was bad.  We've all been there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  How you doing? 
[01:04:00]  Oh, well.  Oh, come on now, poopsie.  Oh, sweetikins.  Oh, don't, uh...  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Suddenly, everything becomes clear.  Oh, yeah.  And she was, from the karaoke stage, she was singing.  Oh, that's nice.  But as she's singing, she's, like, looking at Dennis and singing some of the words really  loud, looking at him and flipping him the bird as she's singing.  And Dennis is just sitting there, like, what the fuck did I even do? 
[01:04:30]  He didn't do anything.  It was, it was...  Oh, she was the angry singer.  Because I can't fucking stand you!  Yes, yes.  Yes!  Oh, God.  Ooh.  Oh, how embarrassing.  Yeah.  Back in the party.  It was close.  It was close to a downer.  It, uh, thank God they, you know, hugged it out at the end.  Oh, God.  A tear, tear-streaked hug. 
[01:05:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  It was so douchey.  Yeah, it certainly is.  And all I'm saying is, thank God certain things changed, or you'd be talking about one of  your co-hosts like that.  I can't believe he did it again.  He cried.  Would you have been that guy at the party?  I was the worst.  Anthony, what are you fucking...  Fucking...  No one cares.  Teenage lesbian waffle.  You'd have been yelling at fucking guests.  Just humiliating.  Making a scene where, like, Jimmy, there's no reason to be mad. 
[01:05:30]  Jimmy, everyone's having fun.  Ah, fuck you.  You don't fucking care if I'm at your party.  Yee.  How embarrassing.  Yeah.  That would be awful, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, well.  All right.  That's pretty much it in a nutshell.  Sounds like a great time.  It was a lot of fun.  Nice.  Well, I'll have more of those.  Yeah.  Obviously.  Let's do it this weekend.  Let's go.  Oh, this weekend. 
[01:06:00]  I think I've got to do some kind of a family thing Sunday.  That's good.  That's why this Friday is Saturday.  Family.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, yesterday, it was quite the contrast.  Because then, after the big Saturday party, Travis and Lisa and little Riley came over with  Ange.  And she brought her girls.  And, yeah, it was nice and relaxed and mellow.  Ah.  It was a family day.  Little, you know, kid. 
[01:06:30]  Eee.  Frolic in the pool kind of a thing.  Yeah, there it is.  Aw.  That's quite the contrast.  I know, right?  It's just like kids at the house.  It's nice.  Look at Travis.  Travis's not here today.  And then, you know, you put a steak on the fucking camera for two seconds with some, like,  Jack Daniels barbecue sauce next to it.  And you get fucking people on Twitter.  What are you using that for?  A little olive oil and say saw. 
[01:07:00]  Fuck you.  I'll eat what I want.  I'll shit on it, okay?  You fucking assholes.  Everyone's got something to say.  No matter what you fucking do.  It's just exhausting after a while.  It is exhausting.  I'll fucking put whatever I want on my steak.  You're not there.  Don't worry about it.  Is Travis not in today because he's recovering from some of this craziness that happened the  next day?  Oh, yeah, this is crazy.  Drinking out of a fucking sippy cup.  He's ankle deep in that water. 
[01:07:30]  He is ankle deep.  He's a madman.  Yeah.  He's ankle deep in the pool water with Riley throwing a rubber ball at him.  How was his McCartney show, did he say?  He said it was amazing.  For sure.  I read a review on it, too.  Paul McCartney played for three fucking hours.  Wow.  Three uninterrupted hours he played.  Wow.  Where he barely took a drink of water.  Wow.  And just sounded amazing.  Played stuff from all of his incarnations of bands and solo acts and everything. 
[01:08:00]  Just amazing.  Fucking amazing.  Three hours?  No, he hardly drank.  I think of the Apollo he drank.  I didn't see him sip water once.  Amazing.  Just one hit after another.  He looks great.  He's got an amazing stage presence and personality and shit.  I wish I would have seen it.  Yeah.  How old is he now?  He's like 72, I think.  Is he 72?  I think he is.  Yeah.  He's 72, Dennis.  Yeah, he's really 70.  And he's up there fucking grabbing instruments.  He's like playing a song with players' bass. 
[01:08:30]  Then he's on keyboards.  And he's fine.  Just amazing.  Amazing.  70.  Yeah.  70?  Oh, okay.  He's 70 years old.  Oh, well, then.  In that case.  Oh, in that case, well.  I thought he was 72.  Jesus.  I thought, you know.  Of course he's doing that at 70.  But to be able to have the, you know, energy to just do a three-hour show like that.  I heard he did a lot of Beatles stuff that he didn't always do.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  That's what I heard, too.  Beatles.  But then he did a lot of Wings and solo stuff.  So, yeah.  Yeah, good time.  Good times.  They'll be at the next shindig. 
[01:09:00]  Well, Paul McCartney is going to be there?  Yeah, Paul McCartney is going to be there.  Sorry, Denny.  It's okay.  You think that asshole neighbor of yours would tell Paul McCartney to turn it down?  If Paul McCartney was playing and she deemed it a little too loud, the cops would show up.  Because she didn't want to hear it.  How old is she?  I don't know.  I never see her.  They were having a party one day, and I launched the drone and got some video to see what they  look like and see what the party was going on.  So, I put the drone over the fence. 
[01:09:30]  Were they aware there was a drone looking at them?  No, it was pretty high altitude.  Oh, okay.  I put it up pretty high.  But I was able to hand the camera down and fucking, I got a good shot of their little party.  They had some younger people there, too.  It was probably a family party.  It was.  It was a family party.  I wasn't sure who was who, though.  So, I need some fucking forward-looking infrared for that thing.  So, I'm really going to...  Do they tell you who calls on you?  I get a good impression as to who it is. 
[01:10:00]  Yes, they do.  They point.  All right.  I thought I told you guineas to get out of here.  I got all your guineas locked up.  Yeah.  Nice.  We should break, probably.  Yeah, we'll break.  We'll have something to eat and more, you know, more fun Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The Opie and Anthony show.  On Sirius XM.

Yeah, I'm in the mafia.  Don't even fuck around with me.  Don't get defensive.  Just explain your business here.  I was in the mafia for years.  My mob name was Will Chippy D.  Okay, Lyle, you have no record.  You've been seen with none of our organized crime contacts. 
[01:14:30]  What was your role?  The hitman.  A hitman?  Mafia hitman.  Right, the mafia.  Well, who do you work most closely with?  I ain't no rat.  Then I don't know why you're here.  Are you afraid of repercussions?  Yeah, good luck killing me.  I carry like fucking bazookas.  Lyle, there's no way you could have carried around a weapon like that.

Mr. Chipperson, why are you here?

[01:15:30]  This is the OPN3 Show.  Hey, mama. 
[01:16:00]  Hey, mama.  Keep me wrong.  Come and love you, daddy.  All right, long.  All right, now.  Hey, hey.  All right.  You see the girl with the diamond ring? 
[01:16:30]  She knows how to shake that thing.  All right, now, now.  Ray Charles, huh?  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Hey, hey.  Died nine years ago.  I am.  What about Gotti?  Gotti died 11 years ago today.  Wow.  John Gotti.  Final episode of Sopranos.  Six years ago today.  A lot of shit going on on this date. 
[01:17:00]  That was on the anniversary of Gotti's death, the final Sopranos episode?  I guess.  I guess that's how it worked out.  How ironic.  Yeah.  It's a very tricky situation.  You like Ray Charles?  No.  No, I do.  You do?  I do like some Ray Charles.  Yeah, most of it.  You know what?  I do.  I just got such a fucking ugh with the stupid Jamie Foxx playing him.  God, do I not?  He did a great job, though.  He was good.  I can't stand him.  The problem is, I don't know.  He's not. 
[01:17:30]  I don't like him.  I was going to say he's not likable.  That's not fair.  I personally don't like him.  He isn't a likable guy.  But with that said, he did a great Ray Charles.  He really did.  He does a Ray Charles impression, and everybody thinks he's a great actor.  How did The Purge do over the weekend?  I saw that you had a picture of the masks in that movie.  Yeah, The Purge did really well.  Oh, good?  Three or four million dollar budget movie, and it made 36.  Damn.  Three or four million?  That's it?  Yeah.  I think it's only in that house.  Yeah.  It's the one set.  No, that's okay.  I think they're pretty happy with that. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Definitely.  It made ten times its budget.  And obviously, it's because Ethan Hawke was on our show.  We really pushed that movie over the top.  Of course.  There wasn't much of a buzz for the movie until Ethan Hawke came in here and really fucking  did some great radio for us.  Oh, yeah.  This show is directly responsible for about 30 of the 36 million dollars.  I would say that's about right, Sam Roberts.  It's good for you.  Yeah.  Are you going to be a big TV star tonight or something?  I don't know if it'll be a big TV star, but I will be on Michelle Beatle's show, The  Crossover, today. 
[01:18:30]  Yo, Beatle!  What the hell's that?  Jim's done it a couple times.  It's on NBC Sports at 6 p.m.  Damn, that's pretty exciting.  What are you going to be talking about?  I don't know yet, but I will be an expert on whatever it is I'm talking about.  It's longer segments now because she's hosting it herself.  Yeah.  They give you some topics?  Not yet.  They will today.  When are they going to give you the topics?  I don't know.  I was hoping they would give them to me on Friday, but they're going to give them to  me today.  No, you get them a day of.  You got to just come up with some ideas.  Yeah.  And it used to be where you'd go on one segment and her and her co-host would do this thing 
[01:19:00]  and then you kind of chime in and give your opinion on what they just said.  Yeah.  But in this one, you actually sit there with her and another guest and discuss stuff and it's  like two or three segments.  It's much longer this time.  When is she doing our show?  I don't know for the after show.  I'll talk to her today.  You don't call her Beetle, I hope, do you?  I always call her Michelle.  I call her Beetle.  Everyone calls her Beetle.  Yo, Beetle.  Yeah, it's like the nickname.  Refuse.  Why?  It's a masculine nickname for a hot girl.  It is.  She is hot.  Beetle.  That's like the thing, though, because she's also a sports girl. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, exactly.  She's like one of the guys, but she's not hot.  She's fucking...  My dad keeps talking about how hot she is.  Really?  Because he just found out he wants to get that handlebar mustache in some places, you think?  Yeah, like four times now.  You think he would, you know...  I think he would.  If the situation was right, of course, because he's married to the lovely Mrs. Roberts.  It'd be a very difficult situation.  The original Mrs. Roberts.  Yes.  Right.  But, yeah.  But, I mean, if let's just say things were different, you think he would get that handlebar 
[01:20:00]  mustache into some places or what?  We were, like, watching Access Hollywood when I was over there for dinner, and I was like,  oh, yeah, that's Michelle Beetle.  That's who she is.  Oh, she's a good-looking lady.  I was on the phone with him last night, and he was like, I saw Michelle Beetle on NBC  this weekend.  How tall is she?  Really?  Whoa.  I've got a squirt buttermilk all over my face.  She wants Michelle Beetle to tinkle on him.  Ah, yes.  Oh, Dad, your mustache smells like sardines again.  Sardines.  Oh, Sam, this isn't sardines this time. 
[01:20:30]  Michelle Beetle's the greatest treat in the world.  She's an attractive lady.  She really is attractive.  Handsome woman.  He can use it classy the whole time.  Oh, he does.  Of course.  Of course he does.  What time is the show on?  The crossover is on at 6 p.m. Eastern on NBC Sports.  Nice.  Very good.  Yeah.  You're a star tonight.  I become a big star tomorrow night.  Whoa.  Is that when the big TBS show airs?  Yeah.  Whoa. 
[01:21:00]  I'm the season finale.  I don't know if that's good or bad.  I don't know if they pushed my episode all the way to the end because it was that bad or if  it's that good, I have no fucking idea.  Damn.  TBS tomorrow night.  Who gets the last laugh?  They never put something they think is bad as the season finale.  Nice.  Nice.  Nice.  Righteous.  No reason for that.  Nice.  They want it to come back next year.  They never want to end on a show.  Nice.  Nice.  It's me, Paul Rodriguez, and Russell Peters.  I want to say Russell Brent every time when I'm thinking Russell Peters.  Anthony was just on Red Eye on Friday. 
[01:21:30]  Look at this.  Red Eye Friday.  I'm doing Red Eye tonight.  Red Eye tonight.  I'm actually waiting for my episode of Inside Amy Schumer to air, too.  Oh, yeah.  Mine airs Thursday.  Yours airs Thursday?  Thursday night.  Yeah.  I saw a trailer or a teaser for the next episode, and I guess Bob Kelly's in it.  I saw Bobby in there doing some shit.  It's hilarious.  You turn that show on.  It's like, I know everyone on this show.  Wait, what's he doing?  I don't know.  He was playing some kind of a doctor, I think.  And he was...  Or a massage. 
[01:22:00]  Oh, Amy was getting a massage.  I'm in that scene with him.  Oh, that's you, too?  Go to her.  You can find it on her.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I just saw Bobby.  That's all the show.  Is there a preview of the scene?  I don't know.  I saw it last night, the preview.  Yeah, if you...  The show is great.  Yeah, Amy's doing great.  It's been picked up for a second season.  Yes, there you guys are.  Holy shit.  All right, that's funny.  This is an...  Yeah, I'm drinking cucumber water right now.  I can't believe you got me a four-handed massage. 
[01:22:30]  Like, I've never even heard of that.  That's...  That's way more expensive.  All right, it's Bobby in the Horton.  That's hilarious.  Creepy's here.  Hi.  Do you guys need me to clear out of here?  Are you Amy?  Yeah.  You have a four-handed massage, yes?  We're your therapists.  I'm Noel.  I'm Gunth.  Namaste.  One minute.  I'm sorry.  Do you have any female therapists available?  I think I just assumed they'd be women. 
[01:23:00]  No women today.  All of our lady therapists are home with period cramps.  They synchronize.  Period cramps.  Can you pause right there for one second?  That scene where we both fucking pop in with Amy, that was probably the 30th take.  Really?  We fucking laughed.  I would imagine you would laugh.  Because I was squatting under the thing, and she would get ready, and every time I would  pop up to talk, we would just start laughing at how stupid it was.  I love that.  And I would see her getting ready to walk over, and it got to a point where I was afraid 
[01:23:30]  I wasn't going to be able to do my line.  Really?  I was going to wreck the show, yeah.  This part of it, we just pop up, and it was very fun.  It got...  That's great.  You look like you're on the verge of laughing.  Four-handed massage.  Before we get started, are there any injuries we should know about?  No, nothing I can think of.  You have no problems with your shoulders, tummy, booty? 
[01:24:00]  No.  Elbows, ankles, ta-ta's?  None of those things.  Everything's okay.  We'll just give you a moment to disrobe.  How much should I take off?  Everything.  We want to touch all of your skin.  Oh, my skin.  We'll be back in just a minute.  Okay.  Oh, you guys are so creepy.  Yeah, yeah, very creepy.  God, are you guys creepy?  Very creepy.  Are you naked yet?  No.  I'm not.  You're naked yet.  Jesus!  Jesus!  What was she wearing?  I don't know if she had anything on. 
[01:24:30]  She might have panties on.  Nice what?  I was talking to guns.  What's up?  He's doing a wonderful job.  Are you tight?  You seem really tight.  Are you feeling tight?  Okay.  Are you guys talking to me or each other right now?  Okay.  Now, we're going to jam on your lower body.  That's crazy.  Our legs are exactly the same.  Okay.  What are you talking about?  Your legs. 
[01:25:00]  Oh.  They're the exact same as our nieces.  Okay.  You know what?  I'm relaxing.  Would you guys mind just not talking?  Maybe, like, just putting on some music?  Of course.  We're sorry.  This probably sounds like Alec Baldwin.  Guys.  Guys.  Guys, I know that's just you singing.  I'm not singing.  Sorry.  Another deep breath. 
[01:25:30]  Okay.  You have a severe knot in this muffin top, and we're going to work it out.  Okay.  How many hands are on me right now?  Very good.  You guys are ghouls.  That's good.  Bald zilchers.  Oh, cool.  Oh, that's not going to cut into Opie's show, is it?  Well, I don't even know.  Are we on Tuesday? 
[01:26:00]  She said Thursday to me.  No, it's Tuesdays.  Tuesdays.  Dumb Amy said Thursday.  Oh, man.  Wait, me and you might be competing.  Uh-oh.  When's my show on?  I don't even know.  It's not going to be 10.30, I don't think.  I don't know.  No.  Amy's 10.30.  It gets very racy.  They've got to put that on late.  She says titties.  Oh, wow.  Look who's on the website.  I'm on the fucking website, finally, motherfuckers.  Give me that link.  Right there.  When am I on?  I don't even know. 
[01:26:30]  How sad is that?  How about they put the fucking time there?  Can we see any of the episodes?  Oh, boy.  Oh, wait.  Tuesday at 10 o'clock.  Okay.  Is it an hour show?  It's a half hour.  Is it an hour?  No, it's going to be an hour.  There's three people.  Three people.  It's a lot to fit into 30 minutes.  You know, on this day of DVRs, it doesn't matter.  You have to DVR one.  It doesn't matter.  I don't even know.  I didn't watch any of the episodes.  Oh, jeez.  I have no idea.  If it's 30 minutes, you can have...  It might be 30 minutes.  She said Thursday for me.  Oh, really?  She's liar, liar, pants on fire.  She might have just hit the wrong thing. 
[01:27:00]  She probably wrote in Tuesday, but then it corrected to Thursday.  She probably had a partial blackout.  Oh, yeah.  Fucking typing with her toes.  Monday, Wednesday, Friday, Sunday.  Yeah, Friday, Tuesday.  Fucking drunken Amy.  I don't know.  I'm on tomorrow night, TBS, 10 o'clock.  It's a half-hour show, right?  It's a half-hour show.  Okay, so...  Perfect.  What a programming block for the fans.  That's a good one.  You check out Who Gets the Last Laugh, see if I win my episode.  That's it.  And then you move on and see Jimmy and Bobby on Amy Schumer. 
[01:27:30]  Perfect.  And Sam and I are on tonight on NBC Sports and Fox News.  Nice.  That's great.  6 p.m. for me, and then Red Eye is on at 3 a.m. Eastern time.  I'll be taking the day off from television.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Speaking of television...  The Tonys?  No, not the Tonys.  No one in this room watched, right?  No, no.  Right?  That's a gay show.  There's no...  You did, did you?  Enough to be a queeb or a quay? 
[01:28:00]  Not that much.  I was monitoring.  You got a bit of the...  Just a little bit?  I wanted to see what the intro was going to look like.  Plus, I was so happy for...  Of course.  You don't know what Neil Patrick Harris is going to do.  Was it a big over-the-top number?  Oh, was it?  I bet it was.  Mike Tyson was actually part of the...  I saw clips this morning.  They kept going after Mike Tyson, or Neil Patrick Harris did, right?  Well, because he had his show, his big show, so he's part of the Tonys, right?  Yeah.  Was he nominated for anything?  I'm not sure.  Well, that's why he...  I forgot.  Okay, I was wondering, why was he there? 
[01:28:30]  Right.  Well, because I like the theater.  I like going in and watching some musicals.  I like that Les Miserables.  Kinky Boots was the big winner.  Kinky Boots got this musical.  That's the Cyndi Lauper musical.  Cyndi Lauper, Harvey Fierstein joint.  Oh, my God.  I gotta call my mother.  Oh, David, David.  Of course, his brilliant performance on Independence Day.  There's no reason to talk about the Tonys, right?  Unless you...  Any highlights? 
[01:29:00]  Unless you want to...  I...  What Tyson...  The opening number's gotta be so gay.  Right.  That's why...  This has to be...  Play a little of the opening number from the Tonys.  Really?  Let's see when it reaches, uh, Queeb.  Believe it or not.  Wait, what are the stages?  Neil Patrick Harris did indeed host the show.  Yeah.  They say he's a terrific host.  They say there, uh, there's a little scuttlebutt about him, um...  Scuttlebutt.  A little, uh, scuttlebutt about him, uh, maybe hosting the Oscars?  Oh.  Because he did such a good job. 
[01:29:30]  Really?  That's what I hear.  Word on the...  In Tinseltown.  So what are the, uh...  Word on the gay?  That we were going to, to see how long till Queeb, Queeb, Queeb...  Well, there's...  The steps.  I would say...  You got...  You got Quee in there.  Quee.  And Queeb.  You got gay.  You got gay, like gay, and then you got gay.  Gay.  Oh, boy.  And then you got...  Queerbait? 
[01:30:00]  Queerbait.  Queerbait, and then you got faggot you gotta use.  Oh, boy.  But there's two faggots, too.  That's terrible.  There's, like, faggot, and then there's...  It could be any, you know, yeah.  It could mean anything.  I mean, if we're going to do the bit, we should do the bit.  Oh, man.  You ready for this?  Please.  How about we just play?  Maybe.  Let's just see.  All right.  All right.  It's only this next singer's fourth time singing in this pub, so cut him some slack.  He's singing something new.  Who's this from?  Oh, it's Neil Patrick Harris. 
[01:30:30]  With an acoustic guitar.  Oh, this is good.  Wow.  Quite an ovation.  See, this is probably supposed to be some kind of parody of a Broadway show that I have no clue.  I'm Neil.  Oh, is he doing once?  I wouldn't be here if someone else hadn't passed on hosting, so...  Special thanks to Shia LaBeouf for this opportunity.  Go Broadway, Joe. 
[01:31:00]  Go Broadway, Joe.  Because Shia LaBeouf was supposed to be in that play with Alec Baldwin, but then passed on it.  Apparently, they didn't get along, and he was...  And who took over that role?  I don't remember.  It was some dude, though.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a little something for the Broadway crowd.  Him and Alec didn't get along?  Yeah, no.  No, I don't think so.  I can break your heart.  Full queep. 
[01:31:30]  We're up to full queep.  And a song that's quiet and small.  But we're back where we began it all.  Oh, boy.  What happened to do, D. Houser?  We sure can't adjust.  We sure can't adjust.  Oh, tonight, we might go bigger. 
[01:32:00]  What?  Oh, no.  Hey, look.  It's Broadway's greatest night, and we're raring to go.  Let's bring on the boxing.  Let's bring it bigger.  Tonight, it's bigger.  We'll take home a Tony statue we don't know.  I guarantee a truly legendary show.  Da-da-da.  Yeah.  The back is very...  Why?  This is so gay. 
[01:32:30]  This is so gay.  We're clear, baby.  Oh, this is just overwhelming.  We're gay now.  They always have to spin and jump and dance.  Why don't they stop it?  What a production.  This shit was done in 1930s.  The cast of Kinky Boots, you know.  They're beautiful and buff as Navy SEALs.  What?  And you could bounce a quarter off the ass of Billy Porter.  Lord, he does a show's a week in eight-inch heels.  Hats off to Barry Gordy.  He runs Motown like a boss.  He dominates Top 40, and he banged Diana Ross. 
[01:33:00]  He rode his own Lopeto, which is really kind of ballin'.  He took every Motown classic, and he said,  I'll put them all in.  Make it bigger.  That's right, it's bigger.  It's bigger.  I just learned this dance like half an hour ago.  Oh, we're going bigger.  Like so much bigger.  You've ever seen so many divas in a row?  Oh, boy.  Stick with me, because your MC's a seasoned pro.  I'm a mo!  I'm a mo!  Put your...  Oh.  This is so inside Broadway. 
[01:33:30]  Tyson had a one-man show.  Let's give the man a hand and make things bigger.  Oh, look.  Ammo!  Woo!  We're going bigger.  The ride is bigger.  And then he's there.  We've got cheerleaders, contortionists, and so... 
[01:34:00]  Hey, he'll go a press sports bar, change the channel to our show.  Go, New York!  The magical Matilda.  He's doing a little dance step.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Oh, this is my favorite show.  Yeah!  Look at Matilda.  They get Tonys, but get fired when they're grown.  Now, here's the kids from Christmas Story.  Annie and Arorphans.  So many child actors high on Red Bull and endorphins.  They barely come up to your knees, but God, they're singing like MVPs,  and they're the reason this whole season seems to look like Chuck E. Cheese. 
[01:34:30]  And, jeez, it's bigger.  That's right, it's bigger.  Is there a Tony daycare where all of you go?  You're getting bigger.  Yeah.  The night is bigger.  Do your parents set aside your Broadway dough?  When I play Doogie, never mind, I'm with the show.  Oh, we'll go.  Oh.  Wow.  Broadway's where famous people go.  What a production.  Oh, yeah.  That's talent.  What a performance, Doc.  What a performance.  He's a good host.  It's easy to make fun, but that's some fucking talent. 
[01:35:00]  How the fuck did he pull that off?  They're fucking dancing.  But everything is ridiculously choreographed.  Yeah.  It looks effortless.  He's got to hit every fucking mark.  Right?  It's not one mistake.  Now he's involved in a magic trick.  Oh, no.  He's in a magic box.  Yeah.  Oh, it's the only, well.  Yeah.  It's the only box he's in here.  Yeah.  Magical.  We should have had him hop out of a closet.  There it is.  Oh, he's taking, he disappeared.  Oh, wow.  Where is he now? 
[01:35:30]  That's incredible.  How is he in the audience now?  That was some David Copperfield shit right there.  That's a fucking magic trick.  Pause that.  It's a witchcraft.  How many seconds did he have to run to the back of the theater?  Eight years in a bloody double.  What the fuck?  He went in and he fucking probably dropped to the bottom of the theater.  Right.  While that whole thing was spinning theatrically, they fucking drove him.  He probably had like a little cart waiting and fucking zipped him down.  All underground?  They don't have that shit underground.  Yeah, they do.  It's Radio City, right?  Radio City musical. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  They don't have that shit underground.  They probably put one of those.  How many seconds did he have?  One of those elevators that they used for the fucking thing.  Oh, and then he just ran out the side.  I don't know why I'm saying that.  You can see that there's a slit in the back of the box.  Well, I didn't see it.  Well, we know he didn't actually disappear.  My point is how many seconds did he have to fucking appear at the back of the theater?  Yeah, he's got to get to the back of the theater.  How many seconds?  Go back.  All right.  From the door closing or wherever the fuck, where he's no longer visible to the audience.  So when he appears again. 
[01:36:30]  All right, there.  So running, running, running, running, running, running, running.  They spin the box.  Oh, that's plenty of time.  Yeah?  Oh, fuck yeah.  By the way, you can see the back end that's soft.  And now he disappeared.  Where is he?  And he's over there.  That's crazy.  18 seconds.  Oh, that's plenty of fucking time.  Exactly.  He probably went out and got a Coke.  It's crazy.  That's fucking...  No, it's plenty of time.  It's very impressive, though.  It was impressive.  It looks like it's a lot less, but... 
[01:37:00]  He's bulged right there.  I know, right?  He's bulged when he's running.  Holy shit.  He's singing about his dick bigger.  I got a dick just like a...  Jesus.  Jesus.  Oh, boy.  Wow.  It's a catchy tune.  This number's only half over.  Oh, my God.  If there's a Newsy you prefer, please let me know. 
[01:37:30]  You'll get a Newsy in your gift bag when you go.  Let's see.  Let's see.  There's like 150 of those punks.  Oh, wait.  Check this out.  Can I have my Tom Hooper layman's close-up, please?  Inside joke.  Yeah, I don't get that.  It's not being sexy.  See, on Broadway, we don't need extreme close-ups to prove we're singing live.  Whoa. 
[01:38:00]  What does that mean?  We sing live eight shows a week.  Check it.  Whoa.  At the end of the day, we are gathered together to honor the best and the brightest.  How does he fucking do this?  Report on your dress.  I know.  Without taking any drinks of water.  If you win, have the time of your life to your manager, dad, and your mom, thanks.  Hi to your kids and your husband or wife, maybe just for the hell of a Tom Hanks.  Something is bigger and better than seeing a veteran get an ovation.  Or seeing a brilliant beginner freak out on a win on their first nomination.  There's a kid in the middle of nowhere who's sitting there living for Tony performances, 
[01:38:30]  singing and flipping along with the Pippins and Wickets and Kinkies, Matillas, and Mormonses.  So we might reassure that kid.  And do something to spur that kid.  Because I promise you, all of us up here tonight, we were that kid.  Oh!  The kick line!  This is theater.  Oh, boy.  Ballgowns.  This is crazy.  They're blown away. 
[01:39:00]  They're all amazed.  They're all amazed.  They're coming out of the woodwork.  Yeah.  Kathy Lee's a Broadway lyricist, so anything can happen.  Bigger!  New York is bigger!  Wow.  So welcome to our bigger, better best on Broadway.  Wow.  What a Broadway champ.  What a production.  Yeah, we did.  I think we all wanted to shit on this and then we wanted to join us.  And you realize the talent behind it is quite fucking amazing.  Yeah, we all quite enjoyed the opening number. 
[01:39:30]  Standing ovation.  It gets five queebs in my book.  Uh, wow.  That's respect for Neil Patrick Harris.  Holy fuck.  Yeah, we wanted to beat the shit out of it.  They're crushed in the fucking radio city.  Get the fuck out of here.  Yeah, it was good.  Wow.  Well.  They didn't have time to get all those people together to keep practicing that shit.  The work they put into that.  It's pretty fucking amazing.  Wow.  Wait.  All right.  Well.  Bigger.  Oh, boy. 
[01:40:00]  Panning the audience trying to find one masculine guy.  Spider-Man.  Oh.  Wow.  It's a rubbing web.  They won't even stop applauding.  Yeah.  They love him.  Standing ovation.  Well, that's our budget.  Good night.  All right.  Oh, Chippa.  You like that, Chippa?  He's fucking delightful, this guy. 
[01:40:30]  Delightful.  Fuck yeah.  Yeah.  I'm a big NPH fan.  Was Wolverine there?  I don't know.  I would hope so.  He likes showing up at the...  Although, maybe, you know, if he was there, he's probably very offended.  He was in the Les Mis movie.  He's not one of these, you know.  That's true.  It's a sellout version.  I didn't like that, dude.  I told you I wanted to watch that and enjoy it, but I was like, ugh.  I loved it.  Fuck, did you?  Loved it.  You loved it? 
[01:41:00]  Way more than I thought I was going to.  Was it fabulous?  Yeah.  It stunk.  The opening song was good, but as it went on, like, you know, when she's in the fucking  dress shop or whatever, who gave a fuck?  I loved it from start to start.  Ugh.  God, I wanted to.  Did you laugh and cry?  Yeah, laugh and cry was emotional.  It's great.  Fucking zilch.  It's awesome.  I'm going to watch it again.  I'll give it another.  Yeah.  What was the opening song, which was okay?  Look down.  Bigger.  Oh, look down.  Look down.  Look down.  And they all sang live, which I like in the movie, but I just didn't care about it. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Although, Neil Patrick Harris will tell you, you don't need the close-up to tell that they're  singing live on Broadway.  On Broadway.  All right.  There you go.  The Tonys.  Yeah, that's our Tonys break.  I wasn't even, I was going for something else last night.  I didn't watch the Tonys.  What'd you watch?  And this is no personal jabs at other people that work here.  I'm just saying as a whole.  That fucking America's Got Talent show is un-fucking-watchable. 
[01:42:00]  Well, they're going to say you're jealous, so be careful what you say.  I used to like that show a lot.  I liked it when Piers Morgan was the guy.  It's awful.  Is it really?  Un-watchable, I say.  Why?  I swear I haven't watched it in a minute.  And I used to love the fucking show.  The acts are terrible.  Yeah.  And they're crowing over them.  Lacking Prince Poppycock? 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Well, there was one.  Here's a prime example of the problem they have here.  There's one act.  There was some guy that was kind of some zen guy, and he levitates himself.  And they put him through.  But it's all he does.  Like one trick.  Well, to defend, I mean, the early rounds, you know, they just throw a whole shitload of people out.  Why?  Throw.  I don't know.  And then they get to Vegas, and then they have a whole room of people, and they go,  well, everyone in this room, you're done. 
[01:43:00]  Why even put him through, though?  I don't know.  I've had it, that show.  How's Nick Cannon?  Look, I know Nick is a friend.  That's right.  That's my boy.  He's a good host, isn't he?  I don't know.  Yeah, I like that.  I didn't mind him as a host.  I just don't like the entire show.  How's who who?  He doesn't, I mean.  How's Howie?  Harmless.  Yes.  Harmless.  Yes.  That's what he is.  He's harmless.  Is Sharon still on the show, or no?  No, he, she, I don't know why she's not on that show anymore. 
[01:43:30]  Yeah, she had something with the network, I remember, last year.  Yeah, she had a little issue with her son, Jack, and the network, I believe, and, you  know, she left nicely, but I wonder what the real fucking story is there.  How's Heidi Klum?  There's nothing going on on the show.  Nothing.  How's Howie Mandel?  Fine.  Fine.  He's fine.  There's nothing exciting, nothing, no surprises, nothing thrilling. 
[01:44:00]  Howie Mandel takes the lead because it seems like all the other judges don't even want  to say anything.  Yeah.  Why?  They have to be called upon before they actually give their critique or any comments of what  they just saw.  It's always Howie taking the lead.  Howie Mandel or Stern?  Howie Mandel.  Wasn't Stern supposed to be like kind of the...  He's supposed to be like the Simon Cowell lead.  He takes the lead every so often from what I saw.  But wasn't he supposed to be the kind of edgy guy, like Piers was?  He's not edgy.  He's not at all.  He loves kid acts and animal acts. 
[01:44:30]  I didn't see him put down one person.  And like this guy, he actually buzzed the Zen guy.  Right.  What was his name?  Something head.  Special head.  Special head.  And he buzzed him before he got to his trick.  There.  There's his trick.  And people are like, oh shit.  And then Howard took back his buzz.  So he's levitating.  Yeah. 
[01:45:00]  Nick Cannon's got more personality than most of the hosts do.  He's that bad.  How magic.  How did he do that?  Does anyone know?  Yes.  Obviously, that's something to do with the stick.  And he's wearing something underneath that get-up.  He's a fucking wizard, this guy.  Why he can't walk very well.  Right?  No.  I think Howard had a premature exification.  Oh, premature ejaculation, Dave.  I was annoyed with you. 
[01:45:30]  Well, I was a-  I was a-  And then lo and behold, you pulled off your special trick, special head.  What the fuck's wrong with his teeth?  I'm going to take my ex back because I actually like what you did.  Taking his ex back.  I've never done that before.  Wow.  First time.  First time.  This was amazing.  And I'm sitting right here and I'm looking and I'm like, how is he doing this?  You know, I'm so glad I didn't-  They're crowing over this like a street performer.  Right.  One trick. 
[01:46:00]  What we just witnessed.  I just saw something.  Who's that?  That's an LB.  Scary surprise.  Oh.  And I definitely want to see again.  It's a yes for me.  Why again?  But you did it.  It is a hands-down definite yes for me.  I want to see a yes.  For me.  It is a yes for me.  You have four yeses.  You're going to bang it!  You're going to bang it!  There's nothing that makes this show any different from any other talent show.  One of these talent shows, yeah. 
[01:46:30]  You don't even have spinning chairs or anything.  Nothing that makes it different.  It's terrible.  Yeah.  Unwatchable.  I haven't watched.  Nick Cannon might be the best of the hosts, though.  He kind of gets weirdly douchey involved with the act.  And, you know, there was some rap act or something.  He was out there shaking his ass with them.  Oh, he does that, though.  He's Mr. Entertainment.  Well, the judges aren't doing anything, so he's got to do something.  Yeah, I guess he's got to jazz it up a little bit.  How happy is Jerry Springer that the show's not really happy? 
[01:47:00]  Oh, Springer was on there, huh?  The show doesn't really have a buzz this year.  No.  I think the ratings were down 16% from last year, too.  Terrible.  I believe.  Nick Cannon is probably a better host than Jerry Springer.  All due respect to Jerry Springer.  I liked Jerry Springer on that show.  He brings a little youth into the program.  I go back with Jerry Springer, though, when he was the Nick Cannon guy.  Yeah, I was watching a little bit of that last night. 
[01:47:30]  Very little bit.  I think I caught the last half hour or something.  Well, you were curious enough to watch.  Yeah, yeah.  I had to see what the fuck the deal was.  Yeah.  And then you were all set?  Yeah.  And then, of course, I said, wow, this show's terrible.  I didn't mention Howard or anything.  Some guy's like, oh, you want approval from him?  No.  You want approval?  I'm like, what?  That's it, isn't it?  I'm just saying the show stinks.  I don't care who's on it.  We don't want any of that.  We don't need any of that.  But I don't even care who's on it.  We've carved out our own careers at this point, you idiots. 
[01:48:00]  Like, it could not even be, Howard.  Whoever it was sitting in that chair.  It's just the show itself doesn't have much oomph.  Let's say hi to Jake in New Jersey.  He's going to tell us how that guy levitated.  Oh, thanks.  Jake.  Yeah.  He has, underneath that fucking big rope, he has this apparatus that has a little feet  on it.  And it runs up.  It runs.  It's like a harness that goes around him on the bottom.  And it runs up his arm. 
[01:48:30]  And when he sits on it, he uses the cane to balance.  And the harness and the stool, it's all connected in one piece.  And the cane balances, and he just sits on that and looks like he's floating.  You can see when he walks out, if you can see when he walks out, he walks out like he's  like a crippled old man.  Yeah, yeah.  Let me see that.  They did that in The Prestige.  Well, obviously.  The old guy that walked with a fishbowl between his legs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Boy, how does he fucking, how does, is he balancing against the stick? 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, the stick is some kind of anchoring device.  The stick is.  Hold on, hold on.  We're going to watch him walk out.  They're not really showing him walk out.  They're showing him a little bit.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's walking out really stiff.  Oh, I'm all right.  All right.  What is your name?  My name is Special Head.  I personally have never taken a sedative.  But I imagine if I would take a sedative and look in the mirror, I would see Special Head.  Let me see if he anchors the stick somehow. 
[01:49:30]  Go ahead.  Okay.  Now, the stick itself has to be anchored.  He's laying it down, but they're showing the judges.  They're not showing him right now.  All right.  Let's look at the stick.  Somebody want to get that?  Oh, boy.  I hate the cutaways.  That was a horrible, horrible line.  They're tight.  Now, he's...  He's ohming and making noise.  I hate the audience shots.  Yeah, the audience shot.  Everything is... 
[01:50:00]  All right.  Now, he just did something very hinge-like.  Yeah.  With the stick.  Did he?  Yeah.  He's probably Magnus.  Messing up his feet, Howard.  I don't know.  How are you supposed to meditate if you're hitting buzzards?  What the fuck are you doing?  Nice.  Like, they go on that one guy. 
[01:50:30]  Happened to be shooting him.  He just, like, lifted his legs up.  He's now sitting.  That's pretty freaking cool.  It looks cool.  That's a really good trick.  The explosion is a distraction away from, um...  I would say at the bottom of that cane, there's a peg that comes out and goes into a hole in the rug that he's with. 
[01:51:00]  Because I think Howard had a premature ex-ification.  That's what I think.  I know what he did.  I know exactly how he did it.  How do you do it, Chipper?  That real quick guy's run out with steps, and he climbs up them, and then he climbs...  Fuck them back down.  Wouldn't we have seen that?  Yeah, definitely.  Not if it's quick.  How do people bring out steps that quick?  It's a big team of guys.  I don't think you've thought this out, Chipper.  They have.  Well, what happened?  Fucking magic. 
[01:51:30]  Fucking magic.  Yeah, that's some kind of a thing in the stick where he must press something, and a big fucking peg comes out of the bottom of it.  And he fits it into the floor somehow.  But do you think, let me ask, under the rug, because there is a rug there, so do you think that he has a seat that he's sitting on that attaches to the cane and lifts him real quick?  Yeah, it's on him.  That seat is on him.  It's strapped to his back, down his arm, and he fucking is able to attach it to the stick that he's holding.  Right.  The stick is not just a stick, it's probably a metal rod that goes right through the fucking thing, anchors at the bottom by the rug, which has a lot of little designs, which covers up the little hole that the peg goes into, and he's literally sitting on a chair that's anchored to that stick. 
[01:52:00]  It's still a great trick.  But he has to attach the stick in the chair.  It doesn't look hack at all.  No.  It's pretty impressive.  Looks good.  Yeah.  Give it to him.  That's fucking magic.  All right.  Yeah.  Well, I don't like this show.  I don't like this show.  I think it's lackluster. 
[01:52:30]  You're just jealous, man.  Maybe that's it.  You are.  We're your network show, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, right?  I was thinking, every time I see a magic trick that I'm curious about, I just want to ask Penn.  Maybe Penn will tell me.  Yeah, how do you do that?  It's probably what you just said, though.  Can we see one thing at the end when the smoke drops?  That is a distraction.  Yes, yes.  And it's for him to pull the stick out of whatever's anchoring it.  Yeah, because he's got to walk away with that stick.  Yeah.  How is that one guy might? 
[01:53:00]  Okay.  That's sick.  How are you doing that?  That's pretty cool.  All right.  He pulled that stick up.  Really?  Yeah.  I didn't see that.  Yeah, he did pull it up.  Show me again real quick.  The last half a second.  There's something going on there.  I want Howard to go first because I think Howard had a... 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, but it's really subtle, man.  It's very.  I mean, it's a good trick.  It's a good trick.  Penn's got to tell me how that's done.  And you know Nick Cannon believes it was real.  Because those people believe in magic.  Black people are very frightened of magic.  They hate it.  Those people believe in magic.  They're scared of it.  They don't understand it.  When Who Kid was in here, the minute he brought up David Blaine's name, he called him the devil. 
[01:54:00]  Why?  What is it with black people and magic?  Black people don't like magic.  Are they creeped out by David Blaine?  Oh, yeah.  Have you ever seen black people on the David Blaine Street Magic special?  Yeah.  They run away.  He specifically goes for black audiences because he knows, what the fuck?  They literally run away from him.  They get petrified.  They have to run.  Yeah.  Yeah, I've seen what he does.  When he does that foot levitation thing, I know how he does it now, but it's still really good.  Oh, Dr. Steve. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, great.  Maybe he's got an answer.  Because I want you to do it.  Yeah.  You put the stick in the rectum.  Take one out.  Anyone?  What's he doing?  He's doing like a card trick.  Probably trying to see some black people.  Bye, black guys.  Stick it in wherever you want.  All right.  Look, I'm going to do a quick mix, all right?  Done, done, done.  Look, ready?  Watch this move.  Oh, did I hurt you?  Sorry?  You all right?  Did you feel that just now?  Look inside of your bottle. 
[01:55:00]  One card.  Just now.  Say it, bro.  It's inside the black guy's beer bottle.  It's inside the black guy's beer bottle.  Let me see.  I can't know what it is.  It's in there.  It's in there.  It's in there.  Crank it open.  Crank it open.  Oh, you all need to move.  That's what you need.  No moat.  No moat.  Let him see it, too.  How you doing, bro?  So the card's in the beer bottle.  Now, is that? 
[01:55:30]  What?  What they don't explain is David Blaine rolls up with his crew and is like, hey, let's have  a beer and do some magic tricks.  Right.  So he hands out the fucking beers, obviously.  Because they all have a beer in their hand.  That's what gives it away.  If the one guy had a beer, then it would be more believable.  Dr. Steve just sent me.  But they all have fucking beers that aren't even open yet.  So he just rolls up.  Hey, let's have some beers.  Going to show you a couple card tricks.  Dr. Steve sent me a link.  To what?  To how the guy did the levitation thing. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah.  There was more of a rudimentary brace that the guy used.  It didn't break down as easy, I guess.  But they show it.  It's fastened to the ground.  Can we see it?  It goes up his arm.  It does something.  What is it called?  But how is it?  It's called the seat fall trick.  Oh.  Let me see.  But what about the right side, where there's nothing there?  Exactly.  How does he balance that part?  He's already on a chair.  It's under his ass.  No, I get it.  But, I mean, you know.  The stick.  No, he's sitting on a seat that lifts him.  And there's something under the rug which balances him. 
[01:56:30]  So you don't need anything on the right side.  That's true.  It's like.  So he's.  You ever see a person on a chair coming down the banister?  Right, right.  It's like a picture.  It's something like that.  Okay.  What's it called?  It's the.  Secret of levitation in India.  That guy right there.  Crank it up.  There we go.  What yogis are supposed to have been doing for centuries.  Hey, yogi.  And what this Indian appears to be doing today. 
[01:57:00]  As a young man many years ago, Indian psychic investigator Preminand set out to learn the secrets of the yogis.  According to yoga, people get eight special powers.  And one of the powers is to levitate in the air.  You will go to Pankot Palace.  What he discovered was not the result of spiritual upload.  Wow.  As the yogic demonstrator climbs back down to earth, the means of his suspension becomes clear. 
[01:57:30]  Concealed beneath his robe, there's a sturdy steel rod which runs down his sleeve to a chair in which he sat.  The whole contraption is anchored in the ground.  Wow.  So now, obviously you can make one of those a little more flexible, articulated.  Oh, so when he's, this is the trick that, when he's like, uh, popping the smoke, he's unhooking his sleeve from the cane.  Right.  And when he's, that's why he had to jump up on the cane. 
[01:58:00]  Yes.  You're looking at him jump, and he's actually snapping his sleeve to the cane.  Right.  His fucking arm brace to the cane.  Put this link, put this link on our Facebook page, E, please.  It's the basic trick, but these little subtleties is how he's, you know, moving the cane around.  For sure.  For sure.  For sure.  How embarrassing when that one doesn't work, and you fall on the fucking chair and falls off.  That would be great.  Imagine if he jumped up, and he hooked it wrong, and he fell back, and the fucking carpet came up, and you could see his bottom brace.  Fucking his dumb anchor folds. 
[01:58:30]  Hey, is there anything you could look up, like magic tricks gone wrong, like in front of people?  Like, there has to be footage of magic tricks that have fucking backfired.  Yeah.  Where people have footage.  And I don't mean some jerk-off in a backyard.  Aside from Siegfried and Roy, that was a classic.  I'll try this one.  It's called Street Magician Does Trick That Goes Badly Wrong.  Oh, no.  Okay.  It's a sealed pack of cards, yeah?  Okay.  Six million views.  I want to seal them.  Is the seal still on there? 
[01:59:00]  You can check if that's not broken yet.  Yeah.  Okay.  I'm going to do, it's a very simple trick.  It's simply a pick-a-card trick.  Okay.  Beautiful new deck of cards, okay?  Taking out those two.  Can you see someone's left arm, too?  Do it.  Let me.  I don't want you to obviously show me the card.  They're very circuit.  They're new cards.  Okay.  You choose a card.  Between the two of you, show it to that camera here.  I don't want to see what card it is. 
[01:59:30]  Uh-oh.  Okay.  Oh, boy.  You tell me when you've chosen the card and shown it to the camera.  Show it to everyone else.  I don't want to see it at all.  All right.  You done that?  Ace of one.  Put the card back in the pack, please.  And shuffle it again.  Okay.  Shuffle it.  Lovely.  Okay.  I'm going to tell you.  All right.  The magician's doing some mumbo-jumbo with the deck in his hands. 
[02:00:00]  In case of clubs with the card.  I'll make it more interesting now.  Wait.  Okay.  Rather than just show it to you.  Uh-oh.  I think he's fucked at this point.  Oh.  He threw it against the...  It's supposed to stick to the car window, I guess, but the window broke.  I'm thinking that's so staged.  Nope.  No.  This is fake.  They did it!  Bam!  No.  It's a prank show. 
[02:00:30]  Guys, that's so stupid.  No, but the guy broke the fucking window and took off.  What a waste of time.  I know you just took a chance there.  That's so fake, obviously.  Why would that have six million views?  That's a good one.  All the fake ones, too.  God.  This one's called Magic Trick Gone Wrong, and it looks like an old guy whose face is blurred  out.  Oh, great.  All right.  Let's see.  Heels, ta-da, and grabs his chest.  Other magicians perform this trick as well, and are just as unsuccessful. 
[02:01:00]  Being blindfolded doesn't help.  I've seen these.  What are they doing?  Many Lindenfields did the same trick.  There's like a spike underneath each one of those paper cones, and he smashes them down.  He says to the ladies, choose any bag, I'll just use that bag.  You know that he's going to be able to avoid the spike, unless something goes a little bit  wrong.  You actually see it in the lady's eyes.  There's this slight sort of hesitation, because she knows where the knife is. 
[02:01:30]  Okay, yes.  I'm pretty sure that this is a good one.  Ah!  Oh!  It's stuck to his hand.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Ow.  He's shoved his hand out.  It's stuck.  Oh, my God.  Dope.  He shakes his hand, and there's blood.  Blood.  Blood.  You can see her, like, ooh.  Blood.  Don't play with knives, kids, is the basic message.  What does this say?  English version of, like, those.  VH1 shows? 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  But how are you supposed to avoid that bag?  Oh, that's the trick.  I know what guy does.  Fast Eddie does that trick.  Does he?  Yeah.  With knives?  He uses, like, a spike, a nail, or something, yeah.  Ah!  Scary.  Yeah.  I love a good magic trick guy wrong.  We should take a break.  All righty.  Yeah, I got to make movies.  Yeah, me too.  You'll be in a thing show.  You'll be in a thing show.  The Series takes him. 
[02:02:30]  No bed for this, right?  I know he wants people to hate him, but I love, love, love Steven Singer.  And he's got a lot of my jewelry right now.  I needed a few things done, so I went down there to Philly, and man, did he take care of everything.  And that is, uh, that's the real deal right there.  I know we're probably going to talk about Father's Day or something here, but I just want people to know that, uh, yeah, I go to Steven Singer when I need shit done. 
[02:03:00]  Or when I need to buy some shit.  So, remember all those, uh, wedding rings and engagement rings that were all cut up and shit?  He fixed all that stuff for me.  Thank you, Steven Singer.  And I didn't have to fucking pay a dime, Sam Roberts.  Nice.  That's what I'm talking about.  Plug fucking Ola.  I don't know.  At its finest.  I want to admit that.  Plug fucking Ola at its finest, my friends.  But you know what?  Even if, uh, even if he didn't charge me, I'd still go there. 
[02:03:30]  There you go.  That's how I take care of that.  Even if he didn't charge you?  Wait, even if I had to.  He doesn't charge you.  Oh, yeah.  He doesn't charge me, but if I had to pay, I would still go to him.  Great prices.  Great prices.  Even if you get charged.  Great cookies.  Great alcohol.  Yeah.  Great bitches.  He's smart.  He gets you all fucked up, but then he sells you a ton of jewelry.  Well, you start buying all sorts of shit when that lady's leaning over like,  Do you like these?  Yeah, yeah.  He knows exactly who to hire in there.  He probably, uh, he probably scolds them in the back for not showing enough cleavage. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  Because they lean over.  What do you think of these?  And, you know, you're supposed to be looking at earrings, but, you know,  you're looking at the fucking, uh, the fucking Burton Ernie's.  He takes a scissor to their top to make sure.  Yes, he does.

[02:06:00]  On today's episode, Uncle Paul reminisces about his favorite photograph.  Yeah, that's Teddy.  That's Teddy and his little brother.  The one on the other side's the girl.  She's kind of tomboyish.  She likes to play basketball.  Have her socks taken off.  Coochie-coo, you tickle him in a tub. 
[02:06:30]  Oh, Uncle Paul, my feet are dirty.  You wash him.  Get him in a tub.  I mean, their feet good.  Take your shorts off.  Let me kiss your toes.  Oh, yeah, they all had to stay in my bed, because they all had bedbugs in their crips.  Come in here, so there's no bedbugs.  And then them goddamn parents are accusing me, saying,  How come he ain't walking right?  I don't know.  I didn't do nothing.  Bunch of lies.  Those damn denar tests. 
[02:07:00]  They said my denar was on the boy's hiney.  I don't know what that means.  Who's that old guy over there?  Uncle Paul, Uncle Paul.  With the creepy old guy staring.  Uncle Paul.  Now he's coming over here.  Slowly limping down the hall.  It's too late now, because here comes Uncle Paul.  Ahoy, mateys.  Time to launch back onto the seven seas with your favorite aqua adventurer, Captain Louie. 
[02:07:30]  It was my first day in the boat.  I just bought it, but it's this big fucking boat with two engines, and it's really complicated to drive.  I took Chris Rock and my manager out on it.  We went out to the Statue of Liberty, and there was this thing floating in the water.  Chris saw it.  I said, what is that?  And it was this big thing, and it was dark.  It was night.  It was like one in the morning.  So it looked like, you know, like a big round raft.  That's what it looked like to me.  And I yelled over, hey, is anyone in that boat?  And then we noticed that it was coming towards us, like kind of with some speed. 
[02:08:00]  And Chris goes, get the fuck away from that thing.  Like, it was creepy.  So I backed away from it, and I put a light on it, and it was like, it looked like a giant manhole cover sticking out of the river.  This was the weirdest night fucking ever.  And it's right by the Statue of Liberty.  It's like, I don't know, 20 feet across, and it's moving.  It's leaving a wake.  So I call up, and then this woman came on and says, New York Harbor Coast Guard, give me your phone number.  So I give her my number, and this guy calls.  He goes, describe it as well as you can.  I go, I don't want to cause a problem, but it looks like the hatch of a submarine, and it's headed towards Lower Manhattan. 
[02:08:30]  That's what I'm seeing, and I'm sure it's not that, but my main concern is it's not lit, and it could cream anything that hits it's going down.  And the guy goes, all right, well, I'll call the boat and send them to you.  So he hangs up, and like 20 minutes later, there's nobody there.  So anyway, I call back, and they're not sending anybody, and at one point I got crazy, and I was like, you are the Coast Guard, and I am saying to you now, there's a submarine attacking Lower Manhattan. 
[02:09:00]  I'm saying it.  And they're like, we're trying to get park police over here.  I'm like, send a fucking helicopter.  And he kept asking me to hover.  We kept hovering around it and stuff, and then finally this big police boat comes.  It shines like a massive light on it, and then he calls me on the radio.  Hey, Captain, are you the one who reported this?  And I go, yeah.  And he goes, it's a mooring ball.  It's been there since 1965.  Mooring balls are so you don't have to throw an anchor down.  You just hook up to it.  And I go, what if you don't see it?  And the guy goes, well, most people navigating those waters know what the fuck they're doing. 
[02:09:30]  I have no business being on the water, and I would have hit it if I hadn't stopped at the Statue of Liberty to show it off to Chris and them.  Maybe not quite the adventure you were looking for.  Well, shiver me timbers, and all that bullshit.  Ah, pig leg!  This fucking parrot just took a shit on me!  God damn it!  Serious.  This is the OPN3 Show. 
[02:10:00]  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  Show.  It's the same old song.  You've got to be somewhere sometime.  And they never let you fly.  It's like broken glass.  You get cut before you see it.

[02:12:30]  What?  Nah, it's a lot deeper than that, people  Oh, my God  We have our own careers  We carved out nicely a long time  The wah wah thing is a real hoot  Yep  You're running out of time to catch the king  That's their new mantra  You're running out of time  That's great  Hey, idiots, we're multi-millionaires, you dicks  Well 
[02:13:00]  Well  Well, not  I had some bad investments  I got  I'm not  You're running out of time  Wah  That's great  Anyway  Yeah  So I have to leave right after  That's exciting, Jimmy  That's really good  I'm right with you  We got Seth Rogen coming in Wednesday  And the premiere for his movies tonight  Which I've already seen  This is the end 
[02:13:30]  This is the end, right?  Yeah  It's a great movie  I loved it  Danny McBride is a fucking rock star slash fucking pimp  And I know I said this already  I gotta say it again  When he comes on in this movie  Holy fuck, his entrance is amazing  Yeah  Fuck yeah  I'm sure it was because they were helping promote that  But Pineapple Express was on FX last night  Yeah  That is a funny fucking movie  You know what?  I gotta tell you  I have to  I thought it was funny  I have to see it again  Yeah, you gotta check it out 
[02:14:00]  It's really funny  I don't think I was in the right headspace for that movie when I saw it  And Danny McBride is killer in that movie  Yeah  A funny guy  Yeah  Well, I mean that movie he did  Which I did like  You know  And they make fun of the fact he was in that movie  Oh, Your Highness  Yeah, they make fun of it in this  This is the end  Oh, I hope so  Because they make fun of each other in their movies  I'm telling you  I love this fucking movie  Because it's so different than anything else  That's been done in certainly many, many years  And unfortunately that movie should have 
[02:14:30]  Was supposed to be the one that pushed him forward as a big fucking movie star  I thought it was funny  I liked it  Did you see it?  You didn't like it?  Yeah  I wasn't feeling it  I just liked it  I'm not gonna fucking oversell it  I mean, Danny McBride is way funnier than that movie  Yeah  And I hope that Hollywood understands that  And gives him another shot at being the big fucking  Holy lard  Movie star  Kings and queens and dragons and middle ages thing  I understood what they were going for 
[02:15:00]  They fell short  I didn't  I don't know what they were going for  They were kind of goofing on that whole fucking genre and shit  But I don't know  He's amazing  He is a funny fuck, man  What's going on with Eastside and Down?  He's bound and down  I thought it was Eastside Dave  I was thinking Eastside Dave  Yeah  He's bound and down  They got one season left  Season four is coming out  And that's the last season  And he's done with that  And moving on, right?  That is a funny show  And Danny McBride doesn't really have a Twitter 
[02:15:30]  Because when I was talking about  This is the end  I was tweeting  You know, all the guys in the movie  And I couldn't find a real Twitter for him  He may not be on Twitter  No, I did all this  Yeah, that ain't him  No, he wouldn't have a thousand followers  So I didn't  I couldn't figure out which one might be his  That's not him  Yeah, he would be verified and all that  I don't think he has one  Yeah, he should be on Twitter as well  So, whatever  War  How did the internship do over the weekend? 
[02:16:00]  18 million?  Yeah, it was a bit of a disappointment  Oh, I thought you meant the party again  Yeah, that was that Google movie?  Right  Yeah  People are saying like, what the fuck is that?  A commercial for Google?  Yeah, people are also saying  I thought Google internships were like  What the heck is Google in 2004?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  What, you know, guys that are under 40 or 40 or so  Yeah  Anyone under 50  Yeah, yeah 
[02:16:30]  It's not going to have trouble figuring out Google  Wait, when did this  Was supposed to take place?  Now  But who doesn't know who Google is now?  I don't know  But I'll tell you  Ethan Hawke was on this show  Yep  Number one movie in America  Thank you, Sam  Number one movie in America  Vince Vaughn was not  Thank you  See, if we bragged  We look like assholes  But you saying it  Thank you  The facts are the facts  Yeah  Them's the facts  The purge did $36.3 million  What else happened over the weekend? 
[02:17:00]  Not much, really, right?  Not really  I'm kind of quiet  In the world, I mean  Oh, in the world?  More scandal  Yeah, what else?  Nothing really  Well, there's a guy that leaked all the secrets  About the government  The leaker  Recording our phone calls  Yeah, I'd say that's the fucking biggest news in the world right now  Yeah  The leaker  Yeah  He came forward with his leaks  Yeah  Obama explained it perfectly  No one's listening to your phone calls  It's all just relaxed  It's all good, man 
[02:17:30]  Yeah  The point being made that it's  You know, hey, we've got to balance things out  You can't be 100% safe  100% secure  Some sacrifices to your personal freedoms  Blah, blah, blah  All to protect us from terrorism  But here's the gist of that  No one's really defining what terrorism is these days  It's a very wide blankie that they're throwing over  What they consider people maybe that don't have the same political ideology that they have  Potentially right-wing groups, they think 
[02:18:00]  Tea partiers  Extremists  You know, this is the same administration that has coddled the Muslims  And Muslim terrorism  So when they say terrorism  Everyone instantly gets that knee-jerk thought of  Well, you know, 9-11, Muslims, Al-Qaeda, things like that  But their definition of terrorism goes a lot further than that  And that's where the dangerous part comes  Where you've got to realize that 
[02:18:30]  When they're checking phone records and getting emails and things like that  It's not just some fucking guy with Saddam or Abdul  Or something in his name  It could be Regular Joe  You know, that's just  You know  What the hell do I know?  Exactly  What the hell do I know, Regular Joe?  I don't blow up anything  I hope it is Regular Joe  Oh, it would be great, right?  They call it terrorism, not terrorism  That's how you know you've got to buckle down 
[02:19:00]  That could be the worst thing Regular Joe's ever said  That was horrible  That should merit a drone attack  Well, you got the drones  It's the drone-on attack  Regular Joe  You give me a buttered roll, a container of coffee  I'll check things out  You know what?  I'll protect the job site  Sometimes a buttered roll and a container of coffee  Absolutely  People drink coffee out of cups  Cup of coffee  Yeah, you drink what you drink  I have a container of coffee walking around a job site  It's a cup  What the hell do I know?  I see something, I say something  Regular Joe, when he leaves like a unit 
[02:19:30]  Like he goes into the unit  And the plumbers are working on something  And he's like, hey  There he has a little chat with him  And he goes, alright, I'm off to you, you know, whatever  The second he leaves that room  Whatever trades are in their work  And look at each other and go  What a fucking asshole that guy is  You know how Regular Joe leaves the room?  How?  He goes, alright, good talking  Now you guys go back to sleep  And he walks out  And then he leaves and they go  Yeah, I'd like to put him to fucking sleep permanently  They just hate Regular Joe, the rest of the guys  As he's approaching him  Oh, this fucking guy again 
[02:20:00]  Hey, look at this and the steam fittest  What's up, guys?  Oh, shut up  Every morning this fuck  Do you know who the SiriusXM version of Regular Joe is?  Oh, Denny  It's Denny  Oh, God, is it really?  Yeah, it's kind of Denny  100%  Hey, how we doing, guys?  I thought Denny became way cooler  Because he DJ'd a dance party  I was hoping that would give him some cred  It didn't give him any street cred  And he brought the fucking popo, too, so  He's in the hallway, like, calling back jokes  That you forgot you made with him 
[02:20:30]  It's just Denny  Are we going to play the whistleblower audio?  Well, yeah, he came out in, like  It's Monday, though, man  It's pretty big stuff  This is some heavy shit  Pretty big stuff here  Yeah, you want to play it?  Alright  We'll play a little  And can we play Alex Jones today?  Alex Jones is fucking going off on Build-A-Bear  Yeah, the Build-A-Bear group  Build-A-Bear group  It sounds very innocent  Kids go there, they pick out the bear accessories  But apparently, he's got a huge problem with it 
[02:21:00]  That Build-A-Bear thing  What the fuck is it, man?  I don't know  They all, like  Everyone meets  But then they're, like  They meet in a way that it's tough to get to them  And there's no press  What the fuck really goes on?  Is it something very innocent?  I don't  But no one  But they don't come out and say  Fuck you all  It's just an innocent, dumb thing  They don't explain anything  Yeah  And I know the conspiracy guys  Will explain exactly what it is  But I'm saying, as just a regular Joe 
[02:21:30]  What the fuck is going on?  What is it really about, you think?  It's a think tank of intellectuals, politicians, scientists  It's just a bunch of people of power  That get together and discuss where they think  The world is heading in the future  With no press  Yeah, it's kind of  That's the tradition of it  They come and go and, you know  I think the secrecy is more tradition  Black cars with tinted windows  Yeah, yeah  I think a lot of it is, like, these powerful guys 
[02:22:00]  And they don't give a fuck that  The conspiracy guys are going crazy over it  I think they like it  Yeah, it gives some mystique to it  I think they want that frat mentality  They want to be in this frat  Exactly, it's like the skulls and things like that  Right, right  And so them being secretive about it  Makes them feel more important over the fact  That it's just a bunch of guys  Getting together  And just talking about  They're probably fucking  Chirking each other off  Yeah  It's nothing  It's probably so stupid  They're just sitting there fucking  Hey, what's up, man?  It's like the Freemason  Alex Jones doesn't think it's nothing  Oh, Alex Jones doesn't think anything 
[02:22:30]  And it's all the bar group  They get together again  They start carving up the world for themselves  Yeah, yeah  Well, they're carving it up at our expense  What they're doing  You know, everybody's watching these people  Drive into the big limousines  And we're just sitting here  Actually flipping the bill  For these guys  It's the bankers  Oh, man  A, that's funny  B, Parachute Guy  Could be the biggest asshole  On the planet  Parachute Guy really  Because  Bumbled it  He jumps off the top of the building  And then he slams back into the building 
[02:23:00]  But he's holding on  So now he's safe  He's okay  But then he decides to let go  And try it again  And then smashes back into the building  Yeah, yeah, yeah  What an idiot  Just rolling down the side of the building  Look, he's just as an idiot  Why are the person filming this  Filming above his head  What are they doing?  I don't know  I don't know  I've just been somebody, you know  Looking out a window  Saying, ah, what do you want from me?  So what do you want to do?  The whistleblower  Or the fucking Bilderberg?  You could call them two different stories 
[02:23:30]  It's obviously the same thing  Over and over again  It's the powerful  Going after the mom and pops  What?  What happened?  What happened with Alex Jones?  He just took over  So we got the BBC  We got a couple things at play  The first is  He was on the BBC  Talking about the Bilderbergs  Because that happened this weekend  Right  And the clips that you have in front of you  The shorter ones  That's like a ten minute clip  I figured we'd just watch it  Because when Alex Jones talks  Sure  We just let it go  Oh, I love Alex Jones 
[02:24:00]  But the second one is  It doesn't mean I agree with Alex Jones  I just love Alex Jones  Who doesn't love it?  He shakes shit up  It's great  And actually, you know  Yeah, you know  He's got a little too much fat around his steak  Is the problem I have with Alex Jones  You cut a lot of that fat away  Yeah, yeah  You know, he's got some tasty meat right there  Yeah, there's some shit happening  He's got some of that tasty meat  But he's kind of the boy that cried wolf  You know?  Right  Yeah  How much of his stuff is believable in your head?  0.0001% 
[02:24:30]  No, it's higher than that  Lower?  Don't you think?  I don't know  It's just  It's been so diluted  With so much  All the other stuff  Wacky shenanigans  Right  That, you know  Right  He could absolutely have a nugget  Right  That is true  If I may use the word nugget  Right  And we would just look at it like nothing  Right  Nothing nugget  Right  The other clips are  Before he went on the air  They actually had somebody from the Bilderberg on the show  And so he posted these videos of big  I cornered the Bilderbergs  And there's a big confrontation  Oh 
[02:25:00]  I mean, it was nothing  I like when it gets all dramatic  I'm here in London, England  Let me tell you  We've had authorities looking at us  We're here, obviously  Bobby, could you come here with the camera?  Could you come here?  I'm going to address the camera  They're watching us  What are you talking about?  No, they're not  They're tourists taking a picture of Big Ben  And you're in the background  Should we play the two clips I got first?  So he confronts the Bilderberg 
[02:25:30]  A Bilderberg member  And he's basically  He's waiting on set  Because he's going on after the break  And this Bilderberg guy was before the break  Right  And as this guy walks off the set  It's just Alex Jones  And I guess he's holding a flip cam or something  Of course  So he's got his flip cam with him  We play this first?  Yeah  Mr. Balls, can I shake your hand?  Hey, Balls  Hey, I'm Alex Jones  I'll kind of let the demonstration  Alex Jones  Great to see you  Why can't you guys talk about Bilderberg?  The  The rules of these things 
[02:26:00]  Are all decided by  People  Who have been there for a long time  I mean, it is a corporate world government  I'll go through that  I need to sit down if that's all right  Thank you  Thank you  There you go  Talking to the Bilderberg  That's it?  That's it  Oh, it doesn't exist  Do we have a sting going into this?  There goes the Bilderberg  Individual  It's okay  Bilderberg individual  That is distracting  What happened?  I know  What are you going to do? 
[02:26:30]  So Ed Balls won't talk about the Bilderberg  Not the Alex Jones of all people  Well, the Bilderberg people are  They're a bunch of assholes  That they're not talking  What a secrecy  And he's like, you know  Well, things are decided  And it is  It's a traditional thing  Where they just don't talk about it  But it's the same way of frat  It's like, yes  Oh, we can't talk about what we did  When we were pledging  The difference is, though  Frat doesn't have people  Who are making real decisions  Right  Now who's being naive  The rest of us  The frat thing in the end  Is a goof  We just found out 
[02:27:00]  What's going on in the Bilderberg  They're picking up marshmallows  With their butt cheeks  And they're dropping it  Whoa, what did I do to you today?  They're dropping it on  The opster wasn't happy that day  I hear the Rockefellers  Started the elephant walk  Where you take your finger  And stick it up another man's butt  Walk around  They do that?  Well, all the frats  Might have done that  The one I played  Certainly did not  Of course  I can't  I can't deny 
[02:27:30]  The marshmallow thing  Certainly  Right, right, right  The opster was not happy  That day  That an Ego pig  Left a fucking doody  In the toilet  Oh, that's another thing  We gotta do  Never mind  Doody hat  No, you know  Oh, boy  The Egos at Geneseo  Were known to be  More pig-like  Right, right  Pig-ish  Sow-like  So, you know  The bit was that  You know  We're now blindfolded  And an Ego pig 
[02:28:00]  Left a doody in the toilet  We have to now  Go in there  And fucking  You know  Get rid of the doody  This is the stuff  We want to expose  Here on the Alex Jones show  What?  So, you know  If you like the pledge  It was a  Right, right  It was a nice banana  In the fucking toilet  Of course  But you're blindfolded  You don't know any better  So if you didn't  But, you know  And, I don't know  Maybe they didn't like me  I have no idea  To this day  I don't know  If I squished a banana  Or a real doody  A real log  Because then  The pledges you really hated  You made sure 
[02:28:30]  You know  One of the boys  Left a good one  In the toilet  Let me tell you something  What are the odds  A frat guy  Is going to be able  To squeak out  A nice solid shit  Like a banana  With people more like  You know  Pour some dinty more stew  In that fucking bowl  Oh, yeah  Yeah  A lot of loosey-goosey  Shits  Exactly  Through my college years  I would know exactly  What that was  If I reached my hand in  Yeah  If it was a banana  I'd know it's a banana  Uh-huh  You wouldn't know any of that  You'd wipe it on your chest  But you wouldn't know any of that  Until you were on the other side 
[02:29:00]  I would feel it  And then you go  Oh, that's what  Oh, that's what that's about  No, I'd feel it  By feeling  I know what shit feels like  You'd also be fucking high as shit  And really drunk  Well, that's true  The Bilderberg  Alright, and then there's another clip  With Ed Balls  Yeah, this is when Ed Balls  Uh, the Bilderberg  Leaves the studio  Sorry  I know, that's just  The big fucking video of the day  Is power shooting  Yes  He's leaving the studio  And then one of Alex Jones' guys 
[02:29:30]  Is outside the studio now  With a flip cam  Do I have cronies  Or henchmen?  Uh, minions  Cronies, henchmen, minion?  Yeah  What am I, minion?  And now he's chasing him down the hall  Saying, well, why would you talk about it?  Oh my god  Hi Ed  I'm Paul  Nice to meet you  Hi, how are you?  What did you talk about?  Bilderberg  Manufactured drama  Breaking your ministerial code  Give us a word, Ed  Please  Breaking the ministerial code?  Yeah  I'm not a  Meeting with secret  Private meetings  I'm not a minister  Yeah, but you meet 
[02:30:00]  You're conspiring with private individuals  I'm not a minister  I'm gonna do a freedom of information  At request  Who did you meet  With the  Eric Schmidt  Don't be silly  What do you think  Valid  Don't be silly  Breaking the ministerial code, Ed  God  Ministerial code  Breaking the ministerial code, Ed  Just a bunch of pompous assholes  Fucking wanker  The Bilderberg people  Is what I'm saying 
[02:30:30]  Yes, indeed  They're pompous assholes  Aren't they?  Not giving us a taste of what they're fucking talking about  Terrible  And then, what, Alex Jones went on this show?  Yeah  Did he storm in or did he  No, he was booked  He was booked  Yeah  Because I read some tweets where he took over the show  He stormed in  He wasn't booked  Well, what I like to do is  I cancel my booking  Seconds before I go out  So it's like I'm actually entering the studio unannounced  And unallowed  He loves manufacturing drama 
[02:31:00]  Yeah  I love it  I love the guy  I think he's fucking  He's very entertaining  I love him too  I'm skipping the part where they  You just can't get wound up on everything he's saying  Like some people do  But he's fucking great  He's an anthony  He's made a lot of money off the conspiracy nuts  Oh, yeah  Mm-hmm  It's good business for Mr. Alex Jones  Look at this English show  There's a fucking old-fashioned clocky in the background  This guy in the suit  And they really are kind of old school over there 
[02:31:30]  And this show's on BBC One  Which is their biggest  BBC One  Network  And it's on in their prime time, too  So millions of people saw Alex just lose his shit  Oh, good  Good for Alex  Millions are fucking lameys  Let's see this shit  And by Alex Jones, an American shock jock  He's been campaigning  Shock jock  For more often  At the Builder Book conference  David Aronovich  Who's a  Oh, sniffy about conspiracy theories  He's a columnist for the time  Sniffy  Alex Jones, you've been covering Builder Book for a long time  What have you ever found out about it? 
[02:32:00]  In that piece you just played  There's nothing in the water  Hydrofluoricylicic acid  In major Harvard studies  The ugly American  Has been causing a seven-fold increase in bone cancer  What's that going to do with Bilderberg?  What have I discovered about Bilderberg?  The BBC was able to get the documents decades ago  That they helped found the Euro  Documents  Which was actually a Nazi German plan  To take over countries economically  No, that's on record  And I've interviewed members of the EU Parliament  On the subject  Who are out there at the event  But what's that going to do with Bilderberg?  3,000 people  They turned 1,000  Bilderberg is heavily involved in the EU plan 
[02:32:30]  And helped hatch it  And it is a Nazi plan  They had Lockheed scandals  I love that we're not alone  In that when we talk to Alex Jones  It's the same as when these guys  He just goes from place to place  They're asking him  They're doing the same thing we do  Like, Alex  But what about this?  Well, I'll tell you about it  And then he doesn't tell you about it  And he knows  If he pauses  Then it fucks him up a little bit  He's done  Yeah, because then it gives the host  A chance to kind of question  What he's saying  To interject, yes, yes  He gives you so much shit in one minute 
[02:33:00]  It would spend  Yeah, yeah  You would spend all day  Looking it up on your own  Yeah, and then he'll say things like  You know, I've seen the documents  I got the document  And you're like  Alright, show me the documents  How do you confirm that?  How do you confirm that?  I've never seen Alex Jones  Show a document  Produce any document  Like, here's the document  And here's where it says that  You just gotta know  I've seen them  Info Wars  Yeah  Go to Info Wars  Yeah, the document  Prison Planet  On his website  Right, right  He is  How does he get all these documents?  He just keeps talking 
[02:33:30]  And if you  It's brilliant  Yes, it is brilliant  And he piles on  So it sounds like he's crushing you  In a debate  Right  Wait, like, you know  A  But what about E  B  And E and F  And then you're like  What about A?  Right  Well, I think we do a better job  Than most shows  Of pinning him on things  And continuing  Yes  Remember we were asking  About the fucking security  About how does that violate  Your civil liberties  Uh-huh  And he just  Would not  Answer  It was a simple  Why wouldn't he answer you think?  Because there's no answer to it  He didn't have an answer for it 
[02:34:00]  And instead  That's the problem  Like, I would enjoy  Conspiracy guys much more  If they really would  Meticulously go through  Point by point  And address each point  Intelligently  But they try that barrel  Ventura does the same thing  Blah blah blah blah  Blah blah blah blah  Thank you for your service  Yeah, so don't fucking  Keep throwing that nonsense  Answers question by question  And we officially  Haven't talked about it  On our show  But he's suing  Chris Kyle's wife  Yeah, that's good  Widow  Yeah, that's good  He's a good guy  Over that whole  Punching incident  Yeah  You would think  As soon as  You know  When Chris Kyle died 
[02:34:30]  That would be the end of that  Yeah, no  But he's continuing  The lawsuit  And he's now officially  Suing Chris Kyle's widow  Well, if you think  That's his wife  Well, you want to believe that  She's a fembot  What?  I'm not suing her  I'm suing the estate  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Is that what he said?  No, but I'm saying  That's what he was  Oh, he would  They're still making money  Off that book  Which slandered my name  Don't I have the right  To have my name  Not slandered  Because somebody's killed  Does that mean  The wrong against me  Has been unwronged 
[02:35:00]  You know  That's rough, man  Yeah  No one cares anymore  About Jesse  Yeah  That's rough  Real piece of shit  That's fucking rough  All you conspiracy guys  That love Jesse so much  That's rough  This was fucking  Chris Kyle  Was a real soldier  He was a real fucking  SEAL  Yeah  Over there fighting  And we know  Where he was  I was a fighter  A Navy SEAL  Wow  Yeah, he's considered  A hero, man  A douchebag  A American hero  And he's murdered  When he comes back  By fucking veterans  He's trying to help  Yeah  All he was doing 
[02:35:30]  Was trying to help  You know  Guys in tough situations  That were also  In the military  And now fucking  Jesse Ventura  Turns around  And sues his widow  Well, it was obviously  A false flag operation  That's fucking rough  False flag  Everyone asked for our opinions  I think it was pretty obvious  On that one  That's just rough  Let's hear a little more  Of our man Alex here  And that's why  The SS officer  Prince Bernard  The founder  Had to step down  It is the ultimate  Lobbying meeting  While you guys  Have this huge scandal 
[02:36:00]  Going on  Your Prime Minister  Is going there  Balls was just here  Bilderberg  Balls  He has forced them  To admit  That there are puppeteers  Above the major parties  David Aron  So now we know  Now we know  That Bilderberg  Has given us the euro  Yes, I mean  If you talk to Alex  For any length of time  You discover all kinds of things  That you didn't know  About  Blown it wide open  You have  Blown it wide open  But it leaves me  With a huge question  For you Alex  Alex just did a  Spicoli where he goes 
[02:36:30]  Alright  The new world order  Which is deadly  Leave your words up  For everyone to see  But it didn't exist  Well this is what  I'm coming to  It's full of criminals  Etc  Who seek to run the world  And will kill anybody  Who gets in their way  And you  Are almost  A happy  A lone crusader  Powering against them  So  How come  How are you still alive  Why am I alive  Which is the explanation  Why am I alive  Which is the explanation  One  They don't exist  Or two  You're part of the  No let me tell you a story  Let me tell you a story  I say the first  Five years ago 
[02:37:00]  When Obama and Hillary  I say the second  Five years ago  When Hillary and Obama  Were at Bilderberg  And the secret service  Was there in helicopters  The new york times  Came out and said  I was crazy  There was no Bilderberg group meeting  And my wife got phone calls  And so did I  You didn't answer  Why you still alive  And the people said  And you better take it serious  Because you were just talking  To your dad  That was in the hospital  You better shut your mouth  Or we're going to cut your head off  But now that  No  They were going to kill you  They listen to everybody's phone lines  They call up  And harass people  That expose them 
[02:37:30]  And tell them  And tell them  What they were just talking about  They harass people  They say there's no spying  It's like not in Germany  The only spy on the bad guys  You let him speak  I saw one of your ministers  Say this though  Alex I'm here  I'm here  Shut up  I'm here to testify  That your head was not cut off  Ladies and gentlemen  If they kill me  It turns me into a martyr  It puts big exclamation points  On the end of what I said  And I have put out  A lot of information 
[02:38:00]  There's millions of others  That are exposing it  And the  Look we have mega banks  That are getting  85 million dollars a month  Now he's going to the mega banks  Most of it goes to Europe  And England  British taxpayers  EU taxpayers  Have to pay to these mega bankers  They're in there  Setting this up  It's come out  And then the media distracts you  With oh look at a guy  That talked to a lobbyist  When the real lobbyists  Are going on  Listen you're not going to dominate this  He gets to speak too  It's not your own radio show  Wow  They don't like him  It's kind of 
[02:38:30]  It's mildly interesting  The Bilderberg group  And it feels  Doesn't it  When you were talking about it  In the film  Slightly kind of out of date  As belonging to the era  When you couldn't  Yeah when you couldn't  Even admit in parliament  That there was a success  When we called the head  Of MI5M  Or whatever it was  We called them  And we couldn't admit  These things  And so to the extent  That it seems  They're not ready  To be spied on yet  What was that a fact  People haven't been acclimated yet  We're in a police state  It's 1984  You guys just want to normalize it  Alex how come you're here  If we're in a police state 
[02:39:00]  They actually turned back  Some of my reporters  But they didn't turn me back  And I was told this  Because they don't want to make a stink  Do you think the BBC  Is part of the Bilderberg group  Well you know  Winston Smith did work here  I mean come on  Eric Blair worked here  And that's what he said it was  Why do you think  Why have we let you on that  See Alex  He's a smart dude  He's not a dummy  And he's his mind  He really doesn't have a fucking mind  Like a steel trap  I mean  It's quick  Yeah he's like  He's quick  He's very informed  Even though I don't agree  With those conclusions  And I think a lot of it's shit  But he like  Like that weird fact 
[02:39:30]  That Winston Smith worked here  Yeah yeah yeah  Like he's prepared  To answer a lot of stuff  The important questions  Why are you still alive  Right right  He'll throw  I've never seen  A better warehouse  Of fluff  And pomp and circumstance  But he's a really smart guy  He pumps out enough  Of these small little facts  To keep himself  Remotely credible  But you can't  You can't debate a guy like this  And think  Oh here's this dummy  Because he'll fucking trounce you 
[02:40:00]  He's not a dumb guy  And then you try to get a point in  And he'll pick everything you say apart  With some fucking shit  But when you keep hitting him  With that one basic question  Yeah yeah yeah  It really does stand out  He cannot answer that one basic question  No no  And conspiracy guys hate  When you do that  Yep  Because you guys think  That you can manage the whole thing  And now our information's  Gotten too big  I have three million radio listeners  A day  That's a low number  Three million  I get about 50 million YouTube views a month 
[02:40:30]  That's a very conservative number  I make films  Put them online for free  That you'll watch 40 million times  Like the Obama deception  And that's why  Because the establishment  Doesn't know what to do  Now Alex has this point  And it's an important one  I would have say  Ten years ago said  Listen to all this stuff  He believes that people  Put cancer virus  In vaccine  On record  In order to create a eugenic  It's on record  Again  It's on record  It's not bad  And we would have said  And I would have said  Hey that's kind of mad  And so on  And it's an interesting 
[02:41:00]  Psychological phenomenon  Like this  The problem is  Conspiracy theories  Like this  Are believed  Are believed  Hey listen  I'm here to warn people  You keep telling me to shut up  This isn't a game  Okay  Our government in the U.S.  Is building female camps  We have an NDAA  Where they disappear people now  You have this  Arrest for public safety  Life in prison  You are the worst person  I've ever interviewed  No  No  It's basically  Off with their heads  Disappear them  Take them away  Thank you for being with us  It's gone  Half past the length  You're watching

[02:42:30]  With the guy  We had a great time  With the fucking XM  We had two visits by him  And then he completely  I think we said  We're not going to see you again  Yeah  I said it  I said it  And he didn't disagree  At the time by the way  No  And FX cancelled his show  Fuck  Of course they did  Because Camel's going on  Every night  Yep  Whatever  It's not  Whatever  My cup of tea  Whatever  That was brilliant  By the way  That is fucking fantastic  He just wouldn't stop  I watch a lot of these 
[02:43:00]  Sunday morning type programs  Up early you know  And you never get this shit  The host was awesome  He's making a noose  And like  Yeah he's like  He's doing the crazy guy  But  I love it  We have an idiot  On the program  It's not a fucking  New show in America  That would say  We got an idiot  On the program  No it's great  I love the honesty  Of that guy  What was the other clip Sam  Was that it  That was it yeah  Yeah that was good  He rules  Yeah freedom  The republic  Let's go to Doug

[02:44:30]  I forgot we have Rashad Evans today. 
[02:45:00]  He's outside the studio.  I'm like, who is that guy?  I know him.  Who that?  Who that?  Who that there?  It's Rashad, man.  Yeah.  Very, very cool.  Oh, yeah.  He has that jaw anywhere.  Yeah.  He's got that fucking...  I'm so unprepared for the Rashad Evans interview.  Yeah.  He's a fighter.  Oh, I know that.  A fighter.  What is he promoting?  I've got to make believe I know what he's talking about.  Oh, UFC 161 against Evans.  Oh, okay. 
[02:45:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Huh?  Yeah, let's get Rashad Evans in here.  My God.  Boop, boop, boop, boop.  He's on the horn, I think.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  We'll give him a little time.  He's on the horn.  Oh, no.  There he is.  I know his record in MMA is 22-3 and 1.  Watch out, Chimor.  All right.  Look out.  What's up, Rashad?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Dude, you're cut.  You're ready to fucking fight, huh?  Yeah, I better be.  Holy shit.  You look trimmer than the last time you were in here.  Yeah, I cut up a little bit, man. 
[02:46:00]  I made sure that I got my weight under control early, but just been heavy in the gym lifting  and stuff, you know?  Wow.  Fuck.  Serious.  I lost three times.  I can't have it.  I can't have it.  Shit.  When was the last fight?  It was Tito, right?  No.  Goodness gracious.  Who did you fight after Tito?  Goodness gracious.  Well, the last time I saw you, you had a bad injury after that fight.  Yeah.  That was the last time I saw you.  Yeah.  I fought Phil Davis and then Jon Jones.  You were here for the Jon Jones fight.  That was the last time we talked to Rashad.  Okay.  Then I haven't seen you since then.  Okay.  Yeah. 
[02:46:30]  Remember, you like to be putting jokes?  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy.  Jimmy Teehee.  Yeah, I know.  I like to be putting jokes.  I know.  And I officially can't do it now because he's just taunted me, so I can't.  It's just too homo-ironic.  And we were rooting for you against Jon Jones.  Yeah.  Sorry.  So you gave him the toughest fight he's had.  Sorry.  Sorry about that.  Hey.  You know, thank you.  I appreciate it.  All right.  I appreciate it.  But yeah, I gave him a pretty tough fight, the toughest fight that he's had yet.  But it wasn't my best performance, but I got to work my way back up there and try 
[02:47:00]  to do it again.  Well, you went five rounds with him.  I mean, and it seems like nobody has been able to do that.  Like, he's just, he's killing everybody.  And it seemed very frustrating for him that he probably just could not put you away.  He couldn't do it.  Yeah.  I mean, I took a couple good shots in that fight, but, you know, that fight was an emotional  fight for both of us.  So, you know, going to the fight, we just had a lot of tension.  And then even during the fight, it seemed to never, like, go away.  You know, he was kind of, you know, he kind of didn't open up as well, and I didn't open 
[02:47:30]  up as much as I could have either.  Right, right.  Did you guys talk afterwards?  No.  I haven't talked to him since.  Actually, I seen him at a club in Vegas one time after the whole thing.  And I just said, what's up to him?  I said, hi to him.  That was about it.  And he responded, or was he cold?  No, he responded.  Wait, did you guys have a real problem?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm trying to remember now.  It was real life.  It was real.  Oh, yeah.  Wait, they were friends and training partners for a long time.  No, it all just came back to me.  I'm sorry.  Yes, of course. 
[02:48:00]  All right.  Do you plan on resolving that or no?  I mean, you know, I don't have a problem with now.  I mean, if you want to talk, you know, I can talk.  But for the most part, I'm all right.  You don't care either way?  No.  I mean, you know, no, I don't really care.  It's just hard if you're mad at somebody, it seems like.  Because fighters can always seem to turn off those emotions.  But if you're mad at somebody and they're punching you in the face, or if you know that  he's winning the round of the fight, that's got to just really add something to it.  It does, man. 
[02:48:30]  It does.  Even after a fight, if you lose to somebody and you don't like them, it's just like,  it makes it that much worse.  That much worse.  Did you take anything out of that?  Like, well, he couldn't, I mean, he couldn't tap me or he couldn't put me away?  Or do you?  No, I just felt like it myself.  Like, you know, I felt let down.  I was really depressed after the fight.  Just like, man, how did this happen?  And how come I couldn't, how come I didn't fight the way I could have fought?  Or how come I didn't do this?  And just a lot of stuff.  But after a while, you know, you learn to just put those feelings and thoughts away. 
[02:49:00]  Because you can't go back.  You know, what's done is done.  You only can move forward.  Right.  What do you do to kind of like, if something like that happens, what do you do to get yourself  out of the emotional fog?  Like, if I have a bad show, you know, the next day, two days later, I'm kind of over  it.  But that's a much bigger thing.  Well, not to interrupt, but what you could do is get back on stage a lot quicker than  he could get back in.  Right.  So when you lose a big fight like that, you've got to wait a long fucking time to really  clear it out of your system.  And you worked so hard for it.  And that's the longest time.  It's like waiting for that chance for redemption again. 
[02:49:30]  Right.  Because you're only as good as your last performance and everybody judges you off of that.  So, you know, if you lose your last fight and you suck doing it, then you suck until you  fight again and prove them otherwise.  Yeah.  We don't care if we suck all week.  If we have a good Friday show, we're good.  Because then the weekend is there.  We're like, oh, man, we killed it on Friday.  Yeah.  We go through the motions Monday through Thursday.  It's all about Friday.  Oh, we're just building up for Friday.  Because that's what they remember.  Yeah.  That was a great show for the weekend. 
[02:50:00]  Oh, I know.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you had a great week of radio.  Oh, I know.  I know we did.  What did you do on Deadliest Warrior?  I was, I guess, let me think here.  What was I doing?  Pig carcass.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I stabbed the pig carcass.  No, what was the, because Deadliest Warrior kind of covers old school fighters, like from  gladiators.  Yeah, so mine was, I guess, the gladiators from that time versus, jeez, I forgot what 
[02:50:30]  it was.  Who was I going against?  I don't even remember.  It's been a long time.  I had too many shots in the head.  Yeah.  But that's what I say every time I can't remember nothing.  Oh, yeah.  I got punched in the head.  That's a good excuse.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Or if I forget someone's name, I'm like, I did a lot of drugs, but I quit when I was  18.  But it's still an excuse I can use, and people are like, all right, they don't want to question  it.  So you don't remember who you're on with?  No, I think it was against Alexander the Great or something like that.  How did they pit you against a historical figure?  I don't know.  It wasn't me per se.  It was warriors from that time versus warriors from that time. 
[02:51:00]  So it was something like that.  So you threw something in a pig carcass?  Yeah, I threw a spear.  And that was it?  No, I did some grappling moves that those guys used to do.  Because I guess they used me because it was kind of talking about the fighting style  that those guys would use in the close quarter combat.  And it was a lot like MMA.  Okay.  You were using your elbow.  Yeah.  Elbowing.  I was like, they were fish hooking, but you can't do that stuff in MMA now. 
[02:51:30]  What's fish hooking?  Oh, God.  Oh, you grabbed the mouth.  Okay.  Was that ever legal?  Huh?  Was that ever legal?  No, it was never legal.  Never legal.  Not even when they first started?  It seems like it would be just like a move that wouldn't hurt.  But that thing, you ever have somebody fishing?  Oh, man.  You haven't had a fish hooking, Jimmy?  It's the worst feeling of all.  No, I wouldn't let anyone put their fingers in my mouth.  Actually, it was just a curved penis. 
[02:52:00]  She's making that up.  Of course, Jimmy.  Yeah.  That would be the worst part of a fish hook is the fingers.  Yeah, because you never know where people's hands are.  Right?  Yeah.  That would suck.  You remember that game when you were younger?  What did it smell like?  Oh, man.  Yeah, the fingers under the nose.  What did it smell like?  You do that, you smell many fish hooks.  You're like, oh, shit, man.  Or wet fingers.  You used to stick your fingers wet in somebody's ear.  That was all funny, but there's nothing more disgusting.  That's disgusting. 
[02:52:30]  That's disgusting.  I didn't think that was funny at all.  No, I did back in, you know, I was stoned, you know, someone's driving, you know.  I wouldn't mind a girl doing it, you know.  Girls, girls got to really do something bad to be disgusting.  They could shove their fucking fingers in my mouth.  I don't care.  Yeah.  Do something bad to be disgusting.  You're like, what?  Like, turn 18.  And you came out in support, which I thought was really great.  You came out in support of, like, gay rights and gay marriage and stuff, which I think is 
[02:53:00]  a lot of fighters probably feel the same way you do, but are scared to kind of come out  and support that, which I think was nice.  Yeah.  One of my friends, Brendan Anian Badejo, he plays for the Ravens, or used to play for  the Ravens.  And, you know, we were talking about it and talking about a lot of issues that they face.  And, you know, I wasn't really aware, you know, I wasn't really aware of something that  just wasn't on my radar at the time. 
[02:53:30]  But, you know, after talking to him and stuff like that, he put me on a ballot.  And, you know, then I started getting more actively involved.  Put you on a ballot.  What does that mean?  Like people who was in support for.  Yeah, people who was in support for.  And, you know, I started to get more actively involved and started to speak about it and  stuff like that.  But, you know, I don't, I definitely, you know, I definitely am for equal rights.  What did he say that kind of, or what was it, an example or something that kind of pushed  you into, oh, wow, I didn't realize that was happening. 
[02:54:00]  Well, it was just about like, you know, you know, the rights they have when they're living  together, being a partner and stuff like that.  And some of, you know, the issues that they have with that.  And, you know, I was just thinking about it from my point of view of like, you know,  if I had a kid and, well, I do have a kid, but if one of my kids become, decide they're  going to be, you know, be with somebody of the same sex when they get older, it would  be, it would be a shame if they couldn't get the same rights that somebody that was married  would be able to get, you know, for the benefit of, for both of them. 
[02:54:30]  Do you think there's any, I mean, there has to be statistically or numerically, are there  any gay fighters in the UFC?  There has to be, again, the odds, the numbers say that there are.  There actually is.  A woman fighter named Liz Carmouche.  Okay.  Yeah.  But I think it's easier for a woman, more acceptable.  I think what you're talking about is, he's saying openly, but you're saying he's got it.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Maybe not.  Yeah.  Because you talked to like when Charles Barkley goes, oh my God, we all played with gay players,  but none of those guys came out. 
[02:55:00]  Sure.  But they just knew.  Right.  Yeah, I'm sure there's some fighters who, who probably gay, but there's never come out  and say, you know.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  That's going to be hard for sports guys.  Yeah, it's definitely hard for sports, especially a fight guy.  Right, right.  Especially a fight guy.  And then even, even more because, you know, the positions that we do and we train, you know,  some of those positions.  Right, right.  I kind of like, you know, if, if, if some guy is homophobic, you might be like, I don't  want to do that with that guy.  Right, right.  You might like it too much.  So that's what, you know, it could be a big fear with coming out. 
[02:55:30]  Okay.  You know.  But is there ever, do you think ever in a fight, like even if you're a complete homosexual,  do you really think that you're getting turned on when, even if you're locked up close when  when the other guy is jamming his elbow into your ribs?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like it doesn't, it doesn't, it doesn't seem like any fighter would be excited by that  because it's just like you're trying to beat the shit out of the other guy.  Yeah.  I mean, I mean, not at all.  You know, if someone is, is gay or whatever case may be, that doesn't necessarily mean  that they find you attracted.  Yeah. 
[02:56:00]  I think it's an ignorance there that people would think like, oh, I don't want to grapple  with that guy.  He's going to, it's like, what's he going to do?  You know, stop.  And there's the fight, the one fight, the fighter who was, I guess, transsexual, who  went from male to female, I think, and did his fighting.  I actually, I actually watched her fight in South Florida.  She fought on the card recently in South Florida earlier this month.  What did you think?  What did I think?  Yeah.  There was a lot of controversy there.  Yes.  I mean, you know, she, I don't think she had a physical edge at all. 
[02:56:30]  Oh, really?  Oh, wow.  No, I don't.  Well, surprisingly, she didn't.  I would have thought for sure she had a physical edge, but she, she didn't, you know, it was  like, it looked like it was evenly matched fight.  Rogan made a good point about that.  Like, it wasn't being homophobic or being, but he said something about because you're  born male, like he was talking about bone structure and, and like a muscle structure  and things like, things that just the males of our species are born with or whatever the 
[02:57:00]  connective tissue is.  Right.  He said, these things that they don't even identify you as far as like, you know, if  you want to say you're a woman, you're a woman.  But like these things that you're born with, uh, does that, do you think make an advantage?  Because that was his point, which I thought was valid.  I mean, uh, you know, anatomically, yes, it should.  It should.  I mean, there's, there's not enough, uh, you know, uh, sex hormone therapy or whatever  that can get rid of that.  Right.  But for the most part, I'm talking about when I seen her fight myself, it did not look like 
[02:57:30]  she had a physical advantage of the girl that she was fighting.  Who won?  Uh, you know what?  I left.  I'm out of here.  I didn't, I didn't, I didn't get, I didn't sit and watch the whole thing.  I left.  You went outside to join the protest?  No, yeah, yeah.  So it was just a curiosity thing.  He's like, oh, let me see what this is all about.  I want to see what it's all about.  Right.  And I was like, all right, I'm going to get out of here.  That's funny.  Do you know what I liked about the last, I watched, uh, the last one, which I thought 
[02:58:00]  was amazing, which was, uh, Bigfoot Kane and Junior against, uh, Mark Hunt and that  last fight they had.  Was, is that the one where they were all running into the, when Tyson was there?  Was that the last one?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It was, it was funny, this effect that Mike Tyson has, even on UFC guys.  Yeah.  Do you, uh, he has that effect, yeah.  Cause I mean, when you think of Mike Tyson, you just think about that dominating presence that  he had before he even stepped into the ring and as a fighter, you have so much respect 
[02:58:30]  for that because you know what it takes to get into that cage and you know, the kind  of imposing figure you would have had to be to just simply destroy a fighter even before  you put hands on it.  Yeah.  I remember watching those pay-per-views and you, you, you literally have an adrenaline  rush waiting for that belt ring.  It's Tyson in the corner.  He's like, you know, and you're sitting there going, Oh my God.  Oh yeah.  This is going to be, and then, you know, fucking seconds later, it's over. 
[02:59:00]  But you didn't care.  No, no.  You just wanted to see him.  Usually when a fight ends real early, you get a little pissed off, especially if you  paid for it.  But yeah, you almost wanted it to be really short again.  Honestly, you kind of like it, man.  I hope it goes a couple of rounds, but if it went like a couple of rounds, you were kind  of pissed off.  Like, man, what's going on with Tyson?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're still going to, uh-oh.  You see, when they did, when the fight started getting longer, you were like, Oh, where is  that guy?  Yeah.  Where's that guy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You see his one man show?  I haven't seen it yet.  I heard it.  I heard it. 
[02:59:30]  I heard it.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  It's really great.  It's weird to see him being, cause he's a funny guy and he's a very silly guy.  Yeah.  And to see him being silly and you realize like, wow, when you watched all these interviews  and these crazy quotes, it was like, he really was not just that one guy that you were seeing.  No, he wasn't.  And that's the thing about, uh, you know, when you're, when you're a fighter, when you're  anybody that's only seen at a glimpse, you know, you only got these highlights and then  it better be a good one or that's how people are going to think that's how you really are.  And, uh, Tyson, you know, after you fight, you know, some crazy things run through your 
[03:00:00]  mind.  If you're a little bit crazy anyways, and you're going to sound really crazy.  You can blurt some stuff.  Oh, he did.  Yeah.  I will eat your children.  That was like one of my favorites.  It made him one of those, it made him one of those, uh, those, those fighters that you  just wanted to watch.  Like it just, and it's actually helped keep him relevant now because people want to figure  out who was that man?  Who is he?  Well, we're finally just relatively recently seeing him in a whole different light. 
[03:00:30]  You know, everybody knew him from what the press threw at us and his insanely wild speeches  before and after fights.  And then you realize, holy shit, this guy's got a great sense of humor.  Yeah.  Uh, he's very smart about, uh, a lot of things.  Uh, he's not just like the, the killer that came flying out of the corner and pound someone's  face.  I know the first time I met Mike Tyson, uh, you know, I was like, man, it's Mike Tyson.  And then he came over and we were talking and I was just blown away with just how, like 
[03:01:00]  how smart he was about life and just about everything in general.  Yeah.  Very philosophical.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It was very philosophical.  And I'm just like, dang, this is Mike Tyson.  You know what I'm saying?  Like, this is Mike Tyson?  Like Tyson was just like, wait, I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe how smart he was.  I was just blown away by it.  Very impressed.  Yeah.  His public persona was very, very different back then.  Obviously we all just thought he was kind of, it really takes like crazy and just kind  of a perfect guy.  It takes a perfect mixture of the personality, the timing, the, like when, when you become 
[03:01:30]  famous like that, to be a legend like that, you know, any one thing taken out of the mix  and it doesn't quite put you over.  I think it was a lot of things that, uh, put him over, uh, at the time.  Yeah.  You know, when you're, when you're a King at like 19 years old, you know, and you've  been, you know, told since the time you're 15 with the background that he's had, that  he's going to be this and he's going to be that.  And he starts to grow into be that. 
[03:02:00]  And there's a lot of things that was unresolved about his childhood feelings that he needed  to sort out, you know, as far as being, you know, on a discipline level.  And, um, you know, when he's given everything so early, it takes a while to just sort out,  you know, when you, you're young like that and you give, giving so much, it takes a strong  person and a strong mind to understand like what this really is.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know, and one, one thing with Tyson too, like people like there, there is this mysterious  thing he has because it's almost like you're, we realized we were watching a guy who might 
[03:02:30]  have been one of the greatest ever.  And it's like, almost like whenever people see him, even now you're waiting for like  that to be recap, like even though he doesn't fight anymore, but it was, it's this amazing  cause like Lennox Lewis beat the shit out of him.  I mean, or, or Evander Holyfield.  And it doesn't matter.  Those guys don't have that, that, I don't know what effect he has had on people, but when  you see him, there's something about Mike.  He wasn't, he lost the belt in what?  91.  He's been the fucking heavyweight champ since in 22 years. 
[03:03:00]  Amazing.  I mean, when I see Tyson, I look at him and I'm like, man, I want him to just hit somebody.  But not me.  Anyone but me.  I want him to just like flip out and just like hit somebody and see if he can just destroy  him.  Do you know, like I always get UFC guys to do stuff.  We've had Tyson a few times and I've never asked him because I, because he's not fighting  anymore.  So I didn't want it to be like, you know, Hey, perform for me.  Whereas with you guys, you're still active fighters.  I didn't want it to seem like I was being a dick.  I'd like to see him just give a little short, right. 
[03:03:30]  Just a little short thud right to your arm.  He wouldn't, he would hurt your arm.  He could, he wouldn't, he's, he's like, I don't think he would do it.  I wouldn't taunt him into doing it because then Mike, you know, Mike has a switch where  he forgets your person and he's professional.  He would punch you 10% and you'd have a dead arm.  But still, I would love to get a shot by Tyson.  He would definitely hurt you.  He's one of the best punches of our time.  He knows how to throw a punch, how to put his body weight.  Ridiculous.  There was lift up.  When you watch Tyson fight, when he would, he would come like, people always say, use 
[03:04:00]  your legs.  That's how you make a punch.  Oh yeah, his legs is.  Sounds nice, but I've never used my legs for anything.  Running away from trouble.  Like the fact that he would come up and use his whole body.  Like I would love to just take a little shot in the right arm.  Just to feel what that's like.  You get hit by such a fucking force.  What is it with you?  Yeah.  Brave soul.  We can't figure it out.  What is this?  Not beat up.  He likes the pain.  When you watch something.  There's something about the pain he feels.  But you respect it more when you feel even a slight percentage of it. 
[03:04:30]  Because a guy like Tyson, how many people who aren't being knocked out by it,  get to feel what that shot feels like on a little level.  That's true.  Like I watch, again, I watch these guys do stuff.  And I know what it feels like to get hit in the leg.  Yeah.  And leg shots, you just watch.  So you can appreciate it a little more when you see somebody get kicked in a fight.  It almost, I literally almost threw up.  When Jon Jones put a knee in my, because I never asked you guys to do shit on fight week.  That was a great judgment error.  Because everybody's like in fucking kill mode.  And he's like on his way to the venue.  I'm like, go ahead, kick me.  And I had to go to the bathroom and throw cold water on my face. 
[03:05:00]  Yes.  Wow, the pain was that intense, huh?  It shocked me.  It was a shock.  I don't know how these guys take a full shot like that.  But they just keep fighting.  I know.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  How do you absorb a blow like that?  I know it's about training and all that.  Yeah.  But mentally, you have to figure it out too, right?  Yeah.  Mentally, you have to figure it out.  You have to sort it out and kind of, you know, does it ever hurt in there?  Every once in a while you feel it.  See, that's what I mean.  And I've heard this from so many fighters that say, every once in a while they feel something 
[03:05:30]  that's like, oh, fuck, that hurt.  Oh, yeah.  But us at home watching, every single move looks like it hurts a lot.  Yeah.  Only something, like the weirdest thing may hurt.  And it's like, wow, that hurt.  Like what?  I actually felt that.  Like if you throw, like one time I threw a kick and he turned his knee in and I ended  up hitting his knee and the pain I felt on my foot when I kicked his knee, it was like.  Oh, man.  You think you broke it? 
[03:06:00]  No, I didn't.  I felt like I broke it at the time, but it was just like.  That's bone on bone like that.  And I could not let him know that I hurt my legs.  So I'm just kind of like moving around, but my leg is not acting the same.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, just trying to hope that he doesn't notice.  And then after a while, then it kind of goes away.  But none of the punches or the holds, they never really.  Yeah, actually, I got kicked in the eye one time real bad.  You know, it was like one of my first fights in UFC and I didn't even really see it coming.  Oh, man. 
[03:06:30]  And I remember like feeling like somebody snuck in here and hit me with a bat.  I felt like somebody else hit me.  I didn't think.  Like what happened?  I'm fighting here.  Why is somebody hitting me?  Why did somebody hit me with a bat?  And I was like, what the hell was that?  You see Jones just towing the left side and fucking hanging off.  Like, what would have happened?  Oh, that was sick, man.  Yeah, that was disgusting.  That was disgusting.  Yeah, yeah.  It was like he seemed like he was like okay with it.  But then once he's seen it, he like got weak.  Then he had to sit down.  Yeah, yeah.  He got weak in his knees.  He got sick.  Now, I was happy to see that though because I wanted to walk in the ring and go, that's  how I felt when you fucking kicked me. 
[03:07:00]  Because I could see, I'm like, he's afraid he's going to pass out or vomit.  He felt like because he was in shock because he was like, he was holding the belt so he  could get some air.  He was probably trying to separate his stomach from the belt a little bit and get a little  air in there.  Yeah, he was about to fall out.  He was about to fall out.  That was sick, man.  Would he have lost the belt?  Because he was beating Chael at the time.  But if he had to be disqualified because he couldn't come out, he would have lost some  technicality.  But, you know.  Another few seconds.  Yeah, he would have lost.  Because Chael lost like the last, what, 30 seconds of that round? 
[03:07:30]  Yeah, if Chael would have hung in there, it would have been interesting to see.  Because if he would have seen his toe like that, he wouldn't have won to compete  anymore.  Yeah, he probably would have stopped.  No way.  No way.  No way.  You can't come out.  It was literally hanging.  Because he just, like when he's seen it, that's when the pain started.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  That's when he's pained.  Before it just kind of felt funny probably.  Get that queasiness.  But then when he looked down and he's seen it, like the pain immediately hit him.  Yeah, yeah.  And who else is on, by the way, because we were talking about Tyson and one of the things 
[03:08:00]  with UFC is, like boxing doesn't interest me anymore because there's no fighters I care.  I mean, there's Mayweather and there's a few guys that are great.  But Mayweather's like the only personality I really care about.  And I think that's helped UFC is the fact that there's no, like if Mike Tyson was coming  up now, he's somebody that everybody wants to watch.  And I think the fact that there's nobody like that in boxing for a while, everybody kind  of turned and was watching UFC and just began to love you guys.  I think it helped you a lot that there was no marquee, well not many marquee fighters 
[03:08:30]  in boxing.  And then people get kind of hooked into UFC and now it just doesn't matter.  Yeah, I think that's a big part of it.  But I think another big part is the fact that the shows that we put on, you know, if you  watch a UFC card, you're going to watch it from the first fight all the way to the main  event and be entertained the whole time through.  You know, that's one thing that boxing really does not do.  They don't put a strong card together where you're going to watch every single fight and  be entertained the whole time.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, there have been so many bouts.  You're watching it just like, all right, come on.  Oh, look, they're hugging again. 
[03:09:00]  Oh, shit.  Yeah.  And I think the turnaround time, how could you have that many name people in boxing,  stars, that are fighting consistently?  It just didn't happen.  It just does not happen.  Remember having to go like, well, okay, I guess we'll see him fight in another year  or something.  But UFC, I mean, bam, you guys are in there all the time.  There's another pay-per-view.  There's another big event going on and a whole other group.  How many fights you got a year?  At least three fights a year. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  You do three.  Yeah, three fights a year.  Wow.  But there's also so many superstars.  There's so many guys that...  You were lucky to see Ali or Tyson once.  Well, Tyson started pushing a little bit.  He would do more than one a year.  Well, Tyson, when he first came on, he fought a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah, because he didn't get hurt in these fights.  They're like, all right, fuck it, get another fight.  But see, that's when boxing was at the strongest.  Boxing was at the strongest when they had the...  Remember you used to come on ABC Worldwide Sports?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  On Saturdays, you'd be able to watch it. 
[03:10:00]  And Saturday afternoon, you can watch some...  Did you say Worldwide Sports?  Worldwide Sports, yeah.  Wide World of Sports.  What is it?  Worldwide...  Wide World of Sports.  Wide World of Sports.  Something didn't sound right there.  I'm like, did I...  Yeah, was it Wide World of Sports?  You're correcting Rashad Evans.  I understood that he got it wrong.  I wasn't going to say anything.  No.  Wide World of Sports.  What's wrong with you?  Because I didn't know if I had just heard...  It was a weird moment.  Like, I was like, something's wrong.  Something doesn't feel right.  Right up.  Right up.  Right up.  Wide World of Sports.  Yeah.  On ABC.  But that's when it was at the strongest, when it used to...  When you used to see it consistently on TV. 
[03:10:30]  Yeah, yeah.  You know, and that's one thing UFC is doing now, is that they're always putting it on TV.  So people have a chance to really get connected to the sport.  And Dana is so passionate about what he does.  He shows through with the product.  You know, he brought it up from nothing.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  So for him, this is his baby.  And he's so frustrated it's not legal in New York.  We saw the map the other day.  It's pretty much legal around the world, except for one little fucking spot.  Everywhere.  From Canada.  In Canada and in the United States, except for this sickening union issue in New York, 
[03:11:00]  that Sheldon Silver and the rest of these guys, it's absolutely embarrassing  and disgusting, and Connecticut's going to make the money, and New Jersey's going to  make the money.  Good.  I don't even care if it's in New York, because I just go to Jersey and watch it.  So let the dummies in New York lose money because of the union.  I know that the Garden's fighting for it, and they'll get it.  If not this year, the next year.  I mean...  Yeah, they'll get it.  It's just too bad.  Oh, we said that last year, too.  It's taking forever.  It's such a huge role in it.  For them to lie and say it's over the violence issue of that, it's like, just stop it. 
[03:11:30]  It is not that...  That isn't the issue.  You're embarrassing yourself at this point.  Yeah, yeah.  We look at that map and see everyone else has accepted this sport.  Is it done in New York for this year, or no?  Not yet.  Has that not been decided yet?  Well, I'm not really sure it's not done.  What?  But is it still possible for it to be legalized in New York this year, or no?  Not really.  Has that passed?  I think so.  The time has passed, then?  I believe so.  Yeah, we're going to have to wait another year, I think.  Yeah, I think they were lobbying a couple months ago.  Yeah, I think that's done again. 
[03:12:00]  Yeah.  I don't know.  God, hateable.  But Rashad is fighting Dan Henderson, who did not look good in his last fight, I didn't  think, against Machida.  And he just couldn't...  I guess Machida's a really weird fighter.  You know, he's off...  Yeah, Machida's weird.  You know, he was hard for Dan to get his hands on, moving around and being as elusive as  he was, so...  It seems like Dan relies on...  And again, I'm not criticizing Henderson, because he has a right hand like a fucking shotgun  blast.  But it's got to be harder, like, when you're only relying on that one...  I think that kind of undid Fedor at one point, and I think it's one thing that will hurt Roy 
[03:12:30]  Nelson, is like, when you're just waiting on that one punch, when you know the right  is coming, it's a little bit easier, I guess, to avoid.  It is a little bit easier, you know, but that's when you've got to add a few more wrinkles  to the game, you know?  So I'm thinking maybe he's going to come with a little more, because he realized in his  fight with Machida that he needed probably a little more, so he's probably going to come  with maybe a left hook, left hook, right hand, I don't know.  It seems like he's impossible to knock out, too. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, he's got a good chin, and...  Big-pick-fucking-head.  Oh, big-ass-fucking-thick-head.  Big-pick-fucking-head.  But he's tough, he's tough, he's real tough, you know, and he's got that mindset, like  he's not going to stop him no matter what.  Big-fucking-melon.  Yeah.  Big-fucking-melon-head, you dick-headed motherfucker.  Yeah, just a fucking, like, a Java man head.  A Viking head.  He really does.  It's a thick fucking punch absorber, his head. 
[03:13:30]  It's like it just doesn't...  I don't know how a guy's...  And you tell him we said that, Richard.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm going to let him know where to find the team.  And Roy Nelson is fighting on the undercard against...  I don't know how to say his last name.  Stipe Miocic.  Okay, yeah.  I would have fucking totally butchered that.  Yeah.  And if Nelson wins this, you know Junior and Kane are going to fight next, but does he  eventually get a shot at the heavyweight title?  Because I fucking love Roy Nelson.  I used to hate him.  He's a big fat guy, but he knocks everybody out.  I think this definitely will put him there where he should. 
[03:14:00]  I mean, Roy has been putting in so much work, you know, and he's tough.  I coached him on the Ultimate Fighter show, and he was one of the most athletic guys that  I've seen.  And it was surprising, too, because he's like, you see him and he's fat.  Yeah, you see him and he's fat, but this dude can kip up from his back to his feet like  nothing.  Really?  Yeah.  He damn near can do a backflip.  It's ridiculous.  And he's a black belt, and people probably misjudge him if they don't know he's a fighter. 
[03:14:30]  Even though he's a big dude in real life, but just to see this big fat guy lumbering  around your pelican.  And that's the thing that makes all UFC fighters a little bit dangerous, because some of us  look like, you know, damn right, like you can just pick on us, you know what I'm saying?  Like we just look like...  Good luck there.  Yeah, you might look like somebody, just like an average guy, don't look like anything,  and then you get the hell beat out of you.  But like Roy, he looked like some fat, out-of-shape trucker.  You know?  And he don't look like he's anything, but he hits you with that right hand, you go to  sleep like three days.  You wonder what tips somebody off. 
[03:15:00]  Like if you're in a confrontation with a guy like that who doesn't look like he's cut  up or a fighter, you wonder at what moment they realize, like, wow, I made a terrible mistake.  Yeah, I've definitely judged the judgment error.  The moment you get pulled up off the floor and woke up and being informed about what  happened, that's when you realize.  But, I mean, could you imagine that, like, seeing him in a bar and being like, you know  what, man?  I'm a...  Yeah, like this big dummy.  Yeah.  He starts talking crazy to him, and the next thing you know, it's Roy Nelson. 
[03:15:30]  Oh, man.  He is 263.  I mean, if you look, he's 6'2", 263.  You don't look at him and go like, this guy's a pushover.  But if a guy's like 6'4", 230, you know, a guy might think, ah, who's this fat fuck?  Right, right.  Yeah, yeah.  If someone's in shape, they're like, ah, kick his fucking ass.  Yeah, exactly.  One punch to the fucking face.  It's over.  You see, Cech Congo, who is fucking one of the best built men in UFC, I mean, just destroyed  him.  Yeah, yeah.  He kind of hit him with the side of his fist on the top of his head.  Oh, man.  He just went to sleep.  It was bad, too.  Fuck, gosh.  And I remember I was working that fight in L.A., and I was commentating on it. 
[03:16:00]  And I'm like, man, he just had to avoid that right hand, avoid that right hand.  Couldn't do it.  Don't circle that way.  And I'm like, and I started thinking to myself, I said, you know what?  I better shut up, because I'm going against somebody with a right hand.  I'll be damn embarrassed if I got caught with a damn right hand.  Right, yeah.  He's talking about that, how not to catch the right, and then.  Yeah, I'll be fucking, I'll be embarrassed if I got caught with a right hand if I just  shut up.  Well, the fight is, because our show is done in one minute, is, you know, Rashad's against 
[03:16:30]  Dan Henderson, and it's Saturday, June the 15th, which today is the 10th.  Okay, this coming Saturday.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, Saturday.  On paper, what time does it start?  I don't have that in front of me.  It starts at 7?  It's like 3 in the afternoon, with all the preliminaries.  On the West Coast, yeah.  If you're on the West, what's it, Vegas?  Dan, it gives you a lot of fun.  No, no, it's in Winnipeg.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, but it starts at 7 on the West Coast, 10 on the East Coast.  Okay.  And, well, good luck, Rashad, and hopefully you will, uh.  You're one of our favorites, Rashad Evans.  Oh, yeah. 
[03:17:00]  Okay, I appreciate it.  Next time I come in, I'm going to bring Uncle Billy.  Remember Uncle Billy?  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Yes.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I forgot about that.  Yeah, yeah.  I'm going to bring Uncle Billy.  Please do.  Bring Roy.  I'd like to interview Roy.  You want to interview Roy?  Yeah.  I want to see you take a punch from Roy.  Oh, please.  You know what?  I, Jimmy, we're lying.  I would take a punch from Roy.  No, no, don't take a punch from Roy.  The thing with Roy is, like, when you watch the views of the overhand right, I wouldn't  take that, but I would take a shot, and I think Roy would happily deliver. 
[03:17:30]  He seems like the type of guy that would go, oh, yeah, punch the hell out of you.  Yeah, he seems like he really would, but I would take a Roy Nelson shot, but I'm hitting  my arm, like, you know, that's the way a man touches himself.  Would you ever take anything in his stomach, a punch in his stomach?  No.  No.  No.  Under no circumstances.  Are you kidding?  I once in a while convinced myself when I'm, like, when I just wake up, if I'm in the  mirror, and I have, like, my blue light in the bathroom on, and the other light on, I  can almost see an ab outline if the shadow hits it, but I really can't.  He's getting there, though.  He's in great shape.  I'm not in great shape. 
[03:18:00]  I'm in better shape than I was.  You are in great shape, man.  Thanks.  I was going to say you're losing weight, but I was like, man, what if you're sick?  I don't know.  You think you're lost?  What if you're sick?  They found something sick.  Jesus.  All right, Rashad.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, we're finishing up for today.  We'll see you guys tomorrow.  Yep.  Fuck.  The Opie and Anthony show is pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  Pretty much over.  This show will be available later today with SiriusXM On Demand. 
[03:18:30]  On Demand.  On Demand.  After 1A Live is next.  SiriusXM.  Hey, hey, hey.  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After 1A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  I wasn't talking to you.  I was talking to the audience.  This girl, she thinks the whole world is revolving around her ever since this compound thing. 
[03:19:00]  Eric, I started After 1A Live with a big yeah like I do fairly frequently.  Yeah.  And this intern turns around like, oh, you're talking to me?  You're saying yeah to me?  No.  It's all about her.  It is.  But you know, when that special treatment comes her way, that's what happens.  She's riding a bit of a high right now.  They develop these egos.  They become...  Not just that.  From who was sitting in the studio next to us.  Who was?  Russell Brand.  Has she got a crush on him?  Oh, I thought we were talking about Rashad. 
[03:19:30]  She likes...  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Does she have a thing for Rashad Evans?  You have a thing for Rashad Evans?  I don't have a thing for him.  I just love UFC.  Oh.  And she...  Ask her if she's attracted to Rashad Evans.  Are you attracted to Rashad Evans?  No.  No.  Oh, she's smart.  She's very political, that one.  She knows very well if she had said yes, that would have been the end of her compound visits.  She's very smart.  I'll talk about it.  I'll talk to them in a minute.  No, the ladies love Russell Brand.  They do?  A lot of the female interns, not just from our department, but other departments. 
[03:20:00]  Why?  Because he looks like them?  I guess.  He keeps walking...  They kept walking by EW and looking in and pawing at the glass.  I love you.  He's very effeminate.  I know.  He's a pretty man.  Maybe it's the height.  I don't know.  I want to remind...  What were you going to say?  I didn't say anything.  Oh, I thought you were gearing up to say something.  I didn't want to miss an E-Rock doozy.  I want to remind everybody that the crossover, that's Michelle Beadle's television show.  I just set my DVR for it. 
[03:20:30]  NBC Sports, tonight at 6 p.m. Eastern, I will be on the show.  Is it going to be weird tomorrow morning?  You have to pull your own clips?  Oh, yeah.  No, I'm not going to pull my own clips.  You got to do that.  No, I ain't doing that.  Oh, well, then I guess nobody's going to hear them.  Because that's not going to happen.  That would be really weird.  And plus, how do you pitch that?  Because here on the show, obviously, we go and we pull audio.  Mainly it's me, and then Eric does every now and then.  But what am I going to come in tomorrow morning with a disc full of clips of myself and say, 
[03:21:00]  Hey, Opie, you know, I really did outstanding last night, and I thought you might want to play some of my zingers.  Here's some outtakes.  No, it'll probably just be me doing horribly, like, oh my goodness, and then I'll have to relive it tomorrow.  Well, this might lead to other things, other interviews that you'll do.  You think so?  And then, yeah, you'll do more and more interviews, but it's not enough to get you to leave here,  so you'll still have to keep pulling those clips and bring them back every morning. 
[03:21:30]  I just keep doing interviews.  I won't actually, like, I won't land a job.  Just interviews.  Jenny Hutt could probably get you in with Dr. Drew.  Yeah, that's right.  She's on that show every night now.  That would be the path I'm on, the Jenny Hutt path, where you could just be a correspondent on these shows,  but it's not enough to get you out of this place.  And then if VH1 brings back the Remember the 2000s and all those other kind of things,  it'll just say Sam Roberts, broadcaster slash comedian, because everyone has comedian credits.  Right, yeah.  I'll have to find an open mic somewhere and just get up for five minutes so I can add comedian to my title. 
[03:22:00]  And it wouldn't say broadcaster.  It would say professional broadcaster.  They don't have enough room in the graphic there.  Well, they're going to have to make room.  Because we're branding here.  It'll just say broad slash comedian.  Yeah, broad comedian.  Lady funny man.  I was, it's a sports show, though, the crossover.  And I don't know what we're going to be talking about today with Beatle,  but I was starting, I'm starting to get a little more athletic.  I went out and bought a bike yesterday.  Remember the conversation that we were having last week about me at the risk of becoming fat as I get older? 
[03:22:30]  So I went out and bought a bike yesterday.  I don't think it was a conversation more as you were being told.  I know, maybe.  Maybe the lesson, remember the lesson I was being taught last week.  But I went out and bought a bike.  Do you ride a bike, Eric?  I haven't in a while.  No, it's so hard.  I had no idea it was difficult.  It's not hard to ride a bike.  It's like swimming.  It's not like swimming, Roland.  No, it is a lot of work. 
[03:23:00]  You think, and I'm not talking, like when you're riding on the road and there's hills  and you have to ride for a few miles and all this stuff.  I thought it was going to be so easy.  I was sore.  I needed water.  I was exhausted.  It really reminded me what terrible shape I was in.  It's not good.  Not good at all.  What kind of bike?  I don't know.  Raleigh?  Huffy?  One of the...  Banana seat with the bell.  Yeah, I got a little basket up front.  That's actually the exact same bike that Pee Wee Herman used. 
[03:23:30]  That's awesome.  It is.  It's got a little thing on the back that spits out marbles in case your enemies are following you.  Were you trying to do tricks and then hit a curb, flew into a lawn where a bunch of kids  were looking at you and you said you meant to do that?  That's exactly what happened.  Wow.  Had a little red bow tie on, too.  Right.  That's right.  Anybody wants to call in 866-WOW1-WOW.  Somewhere around here.  I think the interns might have taken it, but I don't think they threw it out.  What?  866-WOW1-WOW.  Opie's Sudoku puzzle is available for a giveaway.  And this is a very special Sudoku puzzle because Opie, while the show was on, not only did he 
[03:24:00]  complete his Sudoku, but he posted a Vine of his Sudoku being completed...  With no audio.  With no audio because he has to use the Vine on Android, which I guess doesn't work.  But you can own that...  That's Vine video?  No.  The completed Sudoku video.  Opie owns all the copyrights to his Vine videos.  But if you want that, you can call up.  So, Eric, you were the big guest of honor at the compound party, huh? 
[03:24:30]  I wouldn't say guest of honor.  Well, you were...  I would say other people were the guests of honors.  I think I was just the catalyst to start that party.  Yeah, you were the catalyst.  How did you feel today when Ant goes, well...  Because Ant threw this giant party over the weekend.  I didn't get to go because I was out of town.  I posted my own Vine while I was out of town.  The creepy house that we were staying in.  Yeah, I don't get that.  The animal heads with Christmas lights.  I don't know what was going on.  In a red room.  We were upstate in Rhinebeck, New York. 
[03:25:00]  And a bunch of us, there's like 10 people.  And I guess there are a lot of big houses up in Rhinebeck.  And there's a big business of people who either have bed and breakfasts.  Or they rent the houses out to people who are visiting up there for whatever events are going on.  Rhinebeck rules.  I guess.  That was horrible.  So, we get up there.  And we haven't seen the house or anything.  So, I'm just...  I'm going.  I'm looking at all the rooms.  And there's...  It's all...  Every room is different.  And some of the rooms look very modern.  There's a computer in one room. 
[03:25:30]  And then there's the living room.  And this is the room where everybody kind of gets together.  And all over the place, there's a big piano from like the 1800s.  And on top of the piano are two taxidermied raccoons.  And then on the wall are heads of all different animals.  There's two deer heads.  There's a wildebeest head.  There's like probably nine different animals just peering at you.  There's those glass kind of boxes, shadow boxes full of dead insects that are all labeled. 
[03:26:00]  Very creepy portraits, like old paintings and stuff.  I didn't know where that room came from.  But it freaked me out.  Was that where you were sleeping?  No.  I didn't sleep in that room.  I slept downstairs from that room.  But everybody kind of went to bed around 1.30 on Saturday.  And I told Jess, we're not sleeping in this house another night.  We're driving home now.  We drive overnight.  Because I don't want to...  I didn't want to hang out with that weird taxidermy, creepy... 
[03:26:30]  It wasn't good.  What was weirder?  This place?  Or having dinner at your landlord's?  The landlord was by far the creepiest.  I've told that story before.  But hanging out at my landlord's house was the only time in my life that I said to myself,  this could be it.  I could...  This could be the last...  These could be my last moments.  And I started reflecting on the life that I had led.  That was the only time in my life where I was like, that man may murder me.  And there's no escape plan here.  That was by far the weirdest. 
[03:27:00]  I mean, a haunted house with some, you know, creepy taxidermy things,  I could handle that.  The landlord...  I had to find another apartment.  I couldn't have that man in my life anymore.  Mike.  Hey, Sam.  Are you going to do some videos of your bike riding adventures and show us your athleticism?  I probably should.  I probably should.  I probably should.  Sean. 
[03:27:30]  Hey there, Sam.  What's up, buddy?  I got two things.  One, um...  If I have audio or anything like jingles that I'd want to send...  I'm not sure when you guys are planning on doing another jingle contest.  Where would I send that info into?  Send it to obanthony at siriusxm.com.  Okay, excellent.  I also sent a link to your Twitter.  I did some E-Rock and Sal parodies for you guys.  I don't know how good they are, but it'd be something I thought might give you a chuckle.  Is this Sean F? 
[03:28:00]  No, it's not Sean F.  Oh, okay.  All right, so they're...  Okay, good.  So there's all the Sean's across the world are creating E-Rock parodies now.  That's very exciting.  Okay, I'll check that out.  Absolutely, sir.  And the second thing I just wanted to say was...  Slabo!  Very good, Sean.  Thank you.  Roland, you let some Slabos go at Ant's house over the weekend?  I just won.  You only said Slabo one time?  Yeah.  To who?  Um, Anthony Vine video.  Oh, because Ant was recording you?  Yeah. 
[03:28:30]  Uh, one thing.  Tyler!  Sudoku puzzle, please.  Sudoku puzzle.  That's it, huh?  All right.  Stay on hold.  You win.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Okay.  Tyler just won.  So, E-Rock, tell me.  Hold on.  Yeah.  What's going on in there?  I was just telling them how to...  Oh, get the address?  Do they know how to get the address?  Yep.  Okay.  Um, were you too cool for the room at Ant's party?  No.  It's just usually every time there's an event, something always focuses on me. 
[03:29:00]  So, I went this time and just was relaxing, having a good time.  Wasn't going to act out or do anything dumb.  Yeah, but you...  That's what it was.  I was just hanging out.  You weren't just sitting...  It sounded like you were just kind of sitting at the table the whole time while everybody  else was kind of running around having fun.  Excuse me, Ollie.  No, I walked around.  I was downstairs watching the poker game and some of the karaoke.  Ant said he was too cool for the room, Roland.  A little bit.  I don't know, because every time I went in the pool now, he was kind of like floating  around.  Wait, wait.  Hold on. 
[03:29:30]  What the fuck?  What the fuck just happened?  I don't know.  My brain just shut down.  What just happened?  Can you replay that?  Yeah, hang on.  He floated around.  He went to the pool.  Huh?  Floated around.  I want you to listen.  Put those headphones on.  I want you to listen back to what you just told me, Roland.  Because that was the craziest shit I ever heard in my life.  Hold on.  One second.  Okay.  Eric's isolating it right now.  I want you to listen to what you sound like.  Because I want to hear if you hear what we hear, which is just gibberish and mumbo-jumbo. 
[03:30:00]  Do mumbo-jumbo.  I don't know what that was either.  Mumbo-jumbo.  He's just mumbling again.  All right.  I think I got it.  I got it.  I got it.  Snowy in Michigan.  Hey.  How you doing, Sam?  What's up, buddy?  It sounded like you were doing better off staying at the Overlook Hotel.  Did you see, like, two little girls in the hallway or something?  Or something or something?  And it was.  It was isolated, like, the Overlook Hotel.  Yeah.  It was isolated like that, too, because it was up in, like, the forest and stuff.  Who's at Rhinebeck?  All right.  Let's hear what Roland just said.  Roland, you listen.  I know, because every time I went in the pool and that, he, like, kind of, like, floated 
[03:30:30]  around.  Hold on.  Do you understand any of that?  Nah, I was just tired.  That one, you'll give to us.  Yeah, I'll give you that one.  You got to enunciate a little bit when you speak.  I was lazy today.  I was like, well, who cares?  You were lazy today.  No, but Eric floated around, though.  He was by the pool, by the bar, by the table, inside.  Maybe his aunt just didn't see him.  Probably the moment the aunt saw him is where he just sat at the table and ate some food.  That's where everyone was eating. 
[03:31:00]  Did you enjoy yourself, Eric?  Yeah, I had a great time.  Who was the MVP of Ant's Party?  Um, I would have to say, I was going to go with Denny, but it's probably the female interns.  Roland?  Same.  Female interns, huh?  Bring the female interns in here.  Matt in Northern Ireland.  Northern Ireland?  What?  Matt?  Northern Ireland.  Where are you from?  Hello?  Yeah.  South.  South.  Okay, Northern Ireland. 
[03:31:30]  Yes.  Oh, see, that's much more exciting.  The phone screener wrote Northern Ireland.  I don't think she believed somebody from Ireland was actually calling.  He sounds like he's from Ireland.  What are you doing in Ireland?  I'm listening to Rene.  That's very exciting.  Uh, uh, what's going on, man?  Um, I wanted to ask E-Rock about Ant's Lego collection.  Ant's Lego collection.  Oh, yeah.  I'm sorry, too.  What's that?  We found out that Ant has some Legos in his house.  Oh, the guy who's been shitting on you the whole time. 
[03:32:00]  Somebody brought it to my attention is that you might want to check this one room.  Who brought it to your attention?  Um, Mumbles McGee over there.  What's up?  Okay, so you're going through Ant's house, or walking around, and you find Ant's Legos.  Yeah.  It's like the Ad Ad Lego.  Oh, from Star Wars?  Yeah.  Okay.  All posed out.  All the little Lego men all posed.  Really?  Yeah.  It's an expensive set.  How excited were you when you saw Ant's Legos?  I started laughing.  And you're like, I got this.  This is lifetime for me. 
[03:32:30]  Yep.  That's, you finally found one thing on the checklist of things to make fun of Eric about  that he can no longer do it.  And now he'll find nine more things on me, because I found that one.  Yeah, I mean, it's a long list, but at least there's one thing crossed off.  So, Lady Interns, you had a good time?  Yeah, it was a lot of fun.  A lot of fun?  I loved it.  Are you two getting along with each other?  Yeah.  Yeah.  No competitiveness yet?  No.  What happens when, that's probably because Anthony, Opie, like, you guys have been shown 
[03:33:00]  pretty much equal amounts of attention so far, I think.  Do you guys feel the same way?  Yeah.  Do you wonder if one is going to kind of slide into favorite with the other?  You know what I mean?  Like, do you wonder if, uh-oh, this one's getting a little more attention?  You're just trying to pin us against each other.  Is that going to upset the other one?  Honestly, like, I don't talk that much, so I'm probably, like, she'll probably be on  more than I will, just because I'm, like, kept to myself.  Hotline's ringing.  Oh, so, did I pick it up?  No, Eric just did.  So, you're okay, uh, I'm going to pick it up. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, I'm not a fan of attention, so.  Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  We were just, uh, rolling, spilled the beans about your Lego collection.  No, you certainly did.  Now, there is indeed an AT-AT Lego in that far room, but there's a story behind that  Lego.  I didn't get it.  I didn't put it together.  It was an ex-girlfriend.  Her name was Jackie.  And if you recall, she's the same girl that I had to take to the pediatrics of the emergency 
[03:34:00]  room hospital, and she got a tummy ache.  Did you, did you, did you ladies know that?  I've got to, uh, fill in the interns about this story that, uh, Ant was dating a young  lady, we'll say, and at one point she had a little tummy ache, I guess.  She had to go to the hospital, and they, uh, uh, put her into the pediatrics ward, because  that's where she belonged.  Quite embarrassing.  Yes.  So, Ant had to sit in one of the tiny little chairs that's meant for a little kid. 
[03:34:30]  That's why she bought you Legos, so she could play with them and so could you.  And she was the one with the Lego set, uh, as a matter of fact, I still get Facebook messages  from her, um, trying to get that back.  Of the at-hat.  And you can't make fun of her, because she is of age where Legos are appropriate.  She was 17 at the time.  She's...  That's insanity.  She just squeaked into that pediatrics ward?  Yeah, yeah, just squeaked in under the wire.  I think it's 17 is pretty much the last year, but, uh, yeah, but I think I have a picture 
[03:35:00]  somewhere of her in front of the doors, and there's, like, Bug Bunny painted on her.  It was very, uh, very embarrassing.  Was this the same girl that you brought to your high school reunion?  Yes.  That's awesome.  That's so cool.  Well, Jackie was, um, she was so fun.  But there was her Legos.  All right.  So you'll still be making fun of Eric Nagel for his Lego collection?  Oh, of course I will.  Obviously, I'm not there snapping the old Legos together.  Although, that one is great. 
[03:35:30]  It's motorized.  It's awesome.  It actually walks.  Whoa.  It walks?  Yeah, it actually walks.  It's amazing.  It's pretty serious.  Yeah.  It's pretty cool.  Pretty slick.  Yeah.  And, by the way, what was Roland doing in that room in the back?  Um, Anthony put my, uh, baggy in there.  Oh, okay.  He had a quick answer for you.  He was ready for that question.  Damn it.  I thought he was snooping around my house.  No, he never snooped.  All right.  I just wanted to set that record straight. 
[03:36:00]  And, E-Rock, I guess the only time I did see you was when you were sitting at the table.  So, uh, you know, I thought you got around a little bit.  And as Roland said, he saw you saying it's money to float out of the pool.  All right.  I'll talk to you later.  All right, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  So, did everybody get in the pool?  Yeah, I went swimming.  I went in.  I was surprised.  Eric, you usually don't go swimming at the parties.  No, I was sitting on the, uh, on the edge by the stairs where we saw Travis ankle deep. 
[03:36:30]  And, uh, at some point, um, some people got out.  We're going into the hot tub or whatever.  And Roland was just kind of there by himself.  And he kept kind of inching my leg by grabbing it and dragging me into the pool.  Did you pull him in?  That's real balls, Roland.  Like, you are pulling people into the pool when you don't even know how to swim?  Like, you're trying to prank people at that pool?  Only in the shallow end.  I do not prank people in the deep end.  Because why?  It's too scary.  It's too dangerous.  It's dangerous.  It's very dangerous. 
[03:37:00]  Horrible things can happen, can't they?  I had no idea that you didn't know how to swim.  I know.  That's why I got cut.  Because Sal pushed me to the deep end.  And Sal was a little aggressive in the pool.  He was.  He was jumping out of the hot tub into the pool.  And that's a, like, a six-foot wall from the hot tub to the pool.  And in the shallow end, he was jumping him.  And it's real rock.  So when it's wet, it's very slippery.  How great would it have been if he was, like, doing these jumps, trying to, like,  Hey, everybody, look at me.  And he just shatters his ankle when he lands.  And he just shatters his head open.  Yeah.  Depending on how bad the injury, I might, you know, laugh or not. 
[03:37:30]  If it was death, that would be the most hilarious.  And I don't think the party would end.  I think the ambulance would come.  We'd clear him out.  Just like Disney.  Close it down.  Party.  Hit it, Denny.  Exactly.  Yeah.  We're going to stick to the hot tub because the pool's all bloody.  But other than that.  Hot tub's good.  So you don't know how to swim?  I haven't swam in so long.  Do you?  But you don't forget how to swim.  It's like, you know, we're talking about bikes.  Like, you don't.  They throw babies into pools.  And they naturally know how to swim. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah.  Instinctively, humans are not meant to drown.  We have limbs.  But look at all the drowning reports you hear.  Like, someone was so drowned.  You know what?  When I actually...  Someone was so drowned.  The drowning reports you hear.  So-and-so drowned.  Right.  This person drowned last night.  You know what Roland looks like when he tries to swim?  What?  He keeps his arms straight out.  Right?  Almost to balance.  And then he straightens his body where he's almost like he's standing on his toes.  And he's just going...  His feet are not above the water. 
[03:38:30]  They're down at the bottom of the pool.  And he looks like...  You know when Fred Flintstone goes to bowl?  Yeah.  And he's tiptoeing?  Tweet-o-tweet-o-tweet-o.  That's what Roland looks like when he's trying to swim.  Tweet-o-tweet-o-tweet-o-tweet.  Everything you shouldn't be doing not to drown.  Roland puts himself in the exact position to make sure that he sinks to the bottom.  You told us last summer you were doing water aerobics.  Yeah.  I said the pool's four feet.  I mean, no.  I'd back you up on that because I saw you doing water aerobics and it was a shallow pool.  But why would you choose water aerobics if you can't swim? 
[03:39:00]  Four feet.  I like...  I'd set it right there.  Four feet.  Four feet.  So you enjoy a shallow pool.  I love a shallow pool.  Why wouldn't you just learn how to swim?  I don't know.  It's not like you have to take lessons.  All you have to do...  You know how you learn how to swim?  You know how all kids learn how to swim?  This is how I learned how to swim.  No.  You just one day go into the deep end and then make sure you don't drown.  And then you realize when you get back to the shallow end, oh, that thing I was doing  to make sure that I wasn't drowning, that's swimming. 
[03:39:30]  That's the whole process.  And then it all comes together.  Start with the doggy paddle and slowly work your way up.  Just do this.  Like panic.  Oh, I get that.  Just try floating at anything.  You just have to put your legs up and you'll float.  Yeah, I think I'll float.  I just say poof.  You're pretty sure you'll sink to the bottom.  Yeah, after eating a lot of shrimp.  Did you have a lot of shrimp?  It was delicious.  That was another one of my favorite things.  Roland was sitting at the end of the table out there on the patio.  And he'd be talking or whatever, and then he would go, oh, excuse me a second. 
[03:40:00]  He would just kind of lean back with his arm past him and go, uh, could I get some shrimp  and some chicken, please?  Where was the shrimp?  I didn't see no shrimp.  Like he was, it's I didn't see any shrimp.  I didn't see any shrimp.  Very good.  Very good.  We do grammar lessons.  Proper English.  Yes.  Um, you were just being, wait, were you expected to just somebody to come around feeding you  grapes, getting one of those big leaves and fanning you?  No, he was giving finger cues to, uh, Steve, who, who was cooking everything. 
[03:40:30]  It was very good, very hot.  Job, job, Steve.  He's like, uh, can I get some, uh, can I get some more shrimp and some more chicken?  And he was happy to oblige, but just rolling, leaning back, like he was some sort of, you  know, country club member telling, telling the, you know, the, the server, I'm quite sure  that this many people don't have memberships here.  That, that's exactly what he was.  So he's leaning back in his chair and he's just got his one little index finger up and  he's just like, you know, peep, peep, peep, peep. 
[03:41:00]  Let's go move it up and down.  That's a dehumanizing.  No, I walked, I walked into Ant's house and, uh, Steve had a sausage sandwich ready for  me.  How was it?  Delicious.  Of course it was delicious.  I walked in and he goes, would you like a sandwich?  I was like, ooh, yes, thank you.  Did, did, did you eat the most food of anybody?  I don't think so.  Who do you think ate the most?  There's a couple other guys that ate a lot more than that.  Okay, so they were in.  It was an indulgent party.  It was a celebration.  Yeah.  You know, it was a celebration that Ant managed to convince the female interns to come to his  house. 
[03:41:30]  Having a buddy system definitely helped.  Is that what it was?  I don't know if I would have gone alone.  It was definitely a team effort.  Yeah, it was definitely a team effort.  You guys, did you strategize at all?  I mean, we weren't supposed to leave each other's side, but I mean, once we got there.  You agreed, at first you agreed not to leave each other's sides?  Yeah, I know, that was about the first, like, hour, and then we started drifting, and then  we'd meet back up.  Did you ride in together?  Oh, yeah, and then we left together.  She came to my house, and the carpet was up there.  Oh, you too.  We had a slumber party.  You're like BFFs.  What did you wear during the slumber party?  Pajamas. 
[03:42:00]  That's what I'm talking about.  Now.  The good stuff.  Yeah, exactly.  Silk stuff.  Exactly.  So, but you both have boyfriends, correct?  Correct.  Was there any worry there that you were like, okay, you know, this is moving very quickly.  Like, all of a sudden, you're this ingrained in work that, like, we're all friends, and  No.  Four-year-olds aren't really my type.  No?  No.  Ant's young at heart, though.  Well, what about somebody like Sal, though?  What if you go to the party, and everybody's having a good time, and everybody's drinking,  and, you know, there are people your age there, or close to your age? 
[03:42:30]  Yeah.  You know, no worry?  No.  What?  We have a lot of trust.  Yeah?  Yeah, he knows.  He understands this is for my career.  Tell me.  To reach my dreams.  Yeah, but a lot of girls do a lot of things for their careers.  I'm not a lot of girls.  You're right.  A lot of girls are real girls.  I'm a classy girl.  Right.  You're both special women.  Thank you.  But, at the same time, like, I'd be worried if I were, you know.  Maybe they were, and just didn't tell us.  That's the trick.  That probably might have been it.  Maybe they were a little.  It's all about love that's going to come out one night. 
[03:43:00]  Yeah.  And then you keep going to a thousand.  I don't know why I'm going to compete with that.  So, that's it.  So, you drove in thinking, okay, we'll stay by each other's side.  Wait.  You didn't think.  You drove in, and as soon as we parked, the guy, he was like, okay, they said you're going  to pay cash.  Oh.  Yeah, they looked for us.  Because the aunt had sent a car to you guys.  Yeah.  See, that's a class move.  But that's, from the beginning right there.  All right.  If I'm sitting there, and I'm like, how old are your boyfriends?  Mine's 22. 
[03:43:30]  22.  Mine's 21.  Okay.  So, I'm like a 21, 22-year-old guy.  And, like, my girl's gone, and she's in the city.  And now this millionaire radio host is not only, like, you know, throwing this massive  party that, you know, you're not going to, he's not going to throw a party like that for  you.  Your boyfriend, I mean.  He doesn't have the resources.  And he's sending a car for you and all this stuff.  Like, this is the Cinderella treatment.  Let's be honest.  Yeah, it really was.  I guess thinking back on it, it was pretty insane. 
[03:44:00]  It really was.  It really was.  It really was.  But I didn't like the drive there, because our driver, his license expired in March.  March 4th.  You saw that?  Yeah, I did.  I didn't really know what to do about it.  What was it?  We just kept driving.  Was it posted?  Yeah, like, he had it, like, right on the back of his seat, so I could see it.  Little placard.  His license number and all that, and expiration date, 3-4-2013.  I was like, I had to make sure.  I was like, wait, that definitely passed.  Yeah, you're, like, looking at your phone, like, June.  That was literally three months ago. 
[03:44:30]  And he told us it was, like, over an hour from her house, and it took us a half an hour to  get there.  I was like, I don't, this makes me nervous.  So this guy did not have his shit together whatsoever.  And he showed up, like, at 30 minutes before we were supposed to leave.  We weren't even there.  We were at the house.  My God.  Yeah.  So you go, okay.  First of all, you're already creeped out, because his driver is giving you the heebie-jeebies.  Yeah, who did he hire?  And you go, all right, we're going to stick together.  What else was the plans?  I don't know.  I think that was it.  That was it.  You didn't feel it.  It was fun. 
[03:45:00]  But you didn't feel threatened.  No.  No.  Like, you didn't think you needed a plan.  You were just like, you know what, just in case.  But then it didn't get weird.  I mean, it was nervous when we first got there, because it was, like, the only people  we knew were Roland and Sal and Anthony.  And so we were done.  They were all, like, talking to other people.  Who is Sal?  Sal.  Sal?  S-A-L-E.  The driver?  Sal.  I think the driver was safer than Troy's driving.  You think so?  Oh, sweet Jesus, yes.  I'll ask you about that.  I think there was, like, seven of you in the back seat.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  I'll ask you about that.  But who do you think? 
[03:45:30]  Was there anybody?  Ant was obviously a perfect gentleman.  I've been to Ant's house before.  He's a fantastic party host.  He's just a fun guy.  Yeah.  You know, so...  To make sure you have everything you need and whatnot.  You know, and there is no reason for your boyfriends to be worried or whatever.  But is there anybody who was on the staff that was creepy at all?  I had someone Facebook friend me.  Who did?  And they've texted me since I've been here.  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Who?  I just didn't answer.  Who?  You're not going to say?  No.  Do they work for this show?  No, I don't think so.  I don't know who he is. 
[03:46:00]  What do you mean?  You don't...  It was someone next to me at the poker table.  Oh, my God.  Are you serious?  Shut up.  Seriously?  Oh, that's so creepy.  Uh-oh.  And are they...  I know who it is.  Who are you thinking?  I don't know his name, but I know who he is.  Is it that guy?  Is it other Dennis?  No.  I don't know who the other Dennis is.  That's the only reason I said his name.  But he doesn't work here?  I don't...  I don't know.  He wasn't there when we first got there.  Maybe Ant doesn't even know who he is.  He just showed up.  If I remember right, the poker table, besides from Sydney, was just all old guys, right? 
[03:46:30]  It was a bunch of old dudes.  No, there was one girl.  Wasn't there one girl?  But it was an older gentleman.  Yeah.  Well, why'd you give him your phone number?  I don't...  I don't know.  Oh, the one to the left of you.  Oh, I see?  You see?  Okay.  All right.  This is what I'm talking about with you girls.  You're like, no, my boyfriend has no reason to be jealous.  Well, how'd that guy get your phone number?  I don't know.  I just gave it to him.  Like, what?  No, I have my phone number.  What?  Like, that's...  I would hate that if I found out my girlfriend was giving people phone numbers.  I mean...  It is what it is, though, right? 
[03:47:00]  He's getting ignored anyway, so...  No, it doesn't matter.  He might as well not have it.  Yeah, exactly.  It was to make him feel better at the time, because I was beating him in poker.  So I was like, okay, let me give you my phone number so I can keep beating him.  You said earlier you didn't even know whose money you were playing with.  Like, I just sat down and the chips were handed to me.  So it was probably just nothing.  She did.  I saw her, too.  I was going to just take a couple.  Yeah.  I was taking from the people next to me.  She did.  She was off.  Like Sharon Stone in Casino?  Just no one was looking.  What about the boy intern? 
[03:47:30]  Now, there is a third intern.  There is.  He's not here today.  Nobody knows his name.  He doesn't come Mondays.  Yeah.  Nobody knows whether he's here or not.  Nobody cares that much.  Do you feel bad that, I mean, within a week, you both, you have to realize how far you've  eclipsed that dude.  Oh, yeah.  Like, you know that.  Oh, I thought you meant how far we've eclipsed, like, other interns.  Especially the one you're interning with.  I mean, that's even bigger.  It's one thing for these other interns to be like, oh, these fucking bitches.  Now, all of a sudden, they're getting invited.  But can you imagine if you were interning with you? 
[03:48:00]  No.  It's not our fault, though.  No, it's not your fault.  It's not our fault.  I'm awesome.  We didn't ask to be girls.  We just came here and, you know, they want a girl intern.  Have you spoken to him?  What's his name, Eric?  Tyler.  Taylor.  Yeah, Roland keeps calling him by the wrong name.  It's Tyler.  Roland calls him Taylor, though.  Have you ladies spoken to him?  Do you have, like, an intern friendship thing going on in the three of you?  Yeah.  I mean, we have each other's phone numbers.  So you're social with each other? 
[03:48:30]  Yeah.  Enough.  We all got lunch one day.  Oh, you, and it's so much fun.  It was adorable.  That is adorable.  You're all just talking about your hopes and dreams.  Right.  Our aspirations.  I remember when I had those.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Then you came on the Opie and Anthony.  No, they're all dead.  All of them are dead.  See, don't leave with hope.  You can't.  You can't.  Put your three months in.  Try to maintain that, maintain that youthful whatever it is.  Je ne sais quoi.  And then run for the hills.  Take this experience, whatever you gain from it, and get out of here. 
[03:49:00]  Have you heard how he's feeling off of this whole thing?  No, we haven't talked to him about it and how he's feeling.  He went to the Governor's Ball, so it's not like he didn't have, at least he wasn't sitting  home Saturday with nothing to do.  Yeah, but you know he would have skipped.  The Governor's Ball is a concert.  I know.  It was like rainy and shitty.  Everybody was good.  Like, all you have to do is buy a ticket to that.  That's not like, holy shit, the guy, you know, invited me.  Personally invited me to what I thought.  Like, Ant made a big deal about who he was inviting. 
[03:49:30]  And you know who he invited?  He specifically didn't invite him.  Everyone except for that dude.  Hold on.  I think it was just an oversight.  Do you think so?  I think all it was.  The last thing I want to do is misrepresent Anthony.  Yeah, I think it was just an oversight.  Anthony, call him.  Because Anthony had somebody else sending out the invitations.  I think it just got lost in the show.  Just a little something slipped through the cracks.  I was going to say, it's Travis's fault.  Maybe Travis's fault.  He forgot to call him into the office.  The only thing is, because when this whole thing was being discussed on Friday, I remember  that intern specifically outside that window with puppy dog eyes. 
[03:50:00]  Bringing Anthony ice in the middle of the conversation.  And then we told him, thanks, that's good.  That would be good.  You could take off.  I did feel bad.  Yeah, but not that bad.  I still feel bad.  No, because, you know, it sounded like I was not going to go to the party because I  felt bad.  And you ladies will come on this show now and say, I feel bad.  But I was looking at Anthony Cumia's vines.  And you did not look like you were feeling bad on Saturday when DJ Dennis Falcone was playing  shots.  It's sad because you know that one picture he took of me and him? 
[03:50:30]  He tweeted it and it has my Twitter in it.  I got 200 followers in one night because of that photo.  Do you think that the boy intern would be a little jealous of that?  No.  You don't think so?  You don't think he would want the Twitter followers?  No.  No.  No, he absolutely would.  But he wants the Twitter followers.  He would, wouldn't he?  He does like internet blogging or something.  Oh.  Yeah, he does have his own blog.  He does have his own blog.  He's trying to have his own little online brand.  I don't know.  And you're sitting there like, oh, I just gave Anthony a hug.  And now I got 200 followers. 
[03:51:00]  Well, my goal was to have more people following me than I was following.  And then that one night, it was a goal.  It's amazing how the world works, isn't it?  It really is.  It really is.  Absolutely amazing.  Well, what is your Twitter?  At Jackie Knott.  Two E's, two T's.  Oof.  You're going to get more than 200 now.  I think you're going to get more than 200.  Do you have Twitter, Sydney?  I do.  Do you want to give it out?  Sure.  Okay, what is it?  It's Sydney with two D's and then M.  Are there really two D's in your name?  No.  Okay.  It's just Sydney M was taken. 
[03:51:30]  So I put two D's in it.  That's what mine was.  And then an M?  Yeah.  Very exciting.  So everybody can follow them.  Roland.  Yes.  Troy, not a strong driver?  No.  I mean, he's a good driver if this was a race.  A NASCAR.  So you're saying that he's like, Jeff Gordon's a good driver.  Troy's a good driver.  I never heard a Prius car burn rubber four times.  Did you burn the tires on your Prius, Troy? 
[03:52:00]  Roland said you burned the tires on your Prius four times.  Four times?  He said, I've never heard.  Remember the tunnel went, eeeh?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, I rent zip cars.  Yeah.  So I try to...  Okay, so zip cars are like in New York.  A bunch of big cities, they have them.  It's like renting a car, but it's not through a service.  Like parking lots have them, and you pay by the hour, and you can drop them off at a different  location.  It's the most convenient thing in the world.  Yeah, they're great.  Yeah.  But like when I rent them, I just try to beat the fucking shit out of them. 
[03:52:30]  Right.  Treat them like absolute shit, because there is no like...  But my car.  Right.  And they're not going to charge you anything.  Yeah, and I like when I have the emergency brake with the handle.  Like the parking brake, you mean?  So that I'll be driving down the highway.  Yeah.  And I do this with my girlfriend all the time.  She freaks out.  I'll be flying down the highway, and I'll just pull it up, and I'll just...  Yeah.  Six people freaked out.  Why do you do that?  Because it's not my car.  Yeah, but what if it...  Oh, my gosh.  What if you get into an accident?  I want to be professional. 
[03:53:00]  You're really good at this?  I've been doing this for years.  Just throwing the...  I grew up in the suburbs.  I know how to do this shit.  And then on the way up there, he'd get off a bus.  So we were going, zoom.  Yes.  I'm an aggressive driver.  You're an aggressive person.  Well, yeah.  You've got to let some of that out sometimes.  Why a Prius?  Yeah.  Well, because you just take what they give you.  Oh, you're just like, I just want a car.  Yeah, you're just like, I need a car in this day.  And you put it in your address of where you're at, and then it gives you the closest garage  to your apartment.  And you're saying the bigger piece of shit they give you, the worse driving you're going  to do.  It doesn't matter what car they give me. 
[03:53:30]  I'm going to drive awful.  Either way.  Yeah, and I hit cones.  I hit...  We were driving out.  I hit the side of those, like...  Is that true, Roland?  Yes.  It is.  So Troy's not a bad driver.  He's doing this on purpose.  It's scary.  He's a frightening driver.  Roland's just a pussy.  Is he?  Well, yeah, he can't handle my driving.  He also can't swim.  I know.  He's afraid to go in the...  He's afraid to drive with you.  He's afraid to go into the deep end.  All he wants is to sit in a chair and have somebody in a chef coat bring him shrimp all day.  I'm the one that scared him out of the pool. 
[03:54:00]  How'd you do that?  Well, I told him...  I said, I'd love to see if you can get on my shoulders, and let's just walk out in the  deep end to see how far we could go out.  Look, I don't want to insult anybody.  But Roland is a substantial man.  If I was...  I don't know if that was a great idea, Troy.  Thank you.  Well, it's like water.  It's sort of like weightlessness.  Okay, but what if your shoulders are above the water, all of a sudden...  I would kneel down, he'd mount me, and then we'd start walking out, and I wanted to see  how far we could get out, where I'm still walking down in his pool. 
[03:54:30]  And I know, it was like four steps.  Right.  It was like four steps in the deep end.  You wanted to just see.  Because maybe I could be all the way on the bottom of the pool, walking, and then he's  still on top of me.  And you'd go tiptoes, because the water's there to support you, so you can...  Yeah, and I was like, come on, Roland, get on top.  And he's just like, no, no, no, and he runs out of the pool.  I was like, why not try it?  Roland, you've got to learn how to swim.  I know.  Then I'll do that.  Then you'll do that?  Until then.  Why don't you just get a floaty or something? 
[03:55:00]  We should teach him.  We should teach Roland how to swim.  Then Sal pushed me to the deep end, so I had to clean on the rocks.  Is that right?  And I pushed it, and I thought...  I went, ah!  Was Sal aggressive at the pool?  He wasn't the one when I was there.  No.  After a few drinks, he became a little...  Oh, but you had to leave early.  Yeah.  But you brought bitches.  I brought bitches.  But then you had to take the bitches back with you?  Yeah.  Wait, how many people were in this Prius?  Six.  No.  Four or five, yeah.  No! 
[03:55:30]  Prius doesn't see six.  No, we squeezed them in.  You did.  And then you decided it's time for Troy's wacky fun highway hijinks.  Well, I mean, if I have a loaded car, I must have fun with it.  Right, right, right.  Like a clown car in the circus.  Clowns are not boring.  And then when we get near traffic, he's like, we're like hitting 85, and the traffic is coming.  He goes, ah!  But the best part of our trip out there, and this is true, if you go on Roland's Vine.  Yeah.  We saw Geraldo Rivera on the fucking way out, and I don't care what anybody says.  It was Geraldo.  Anthony says he blew that shit up and said it wasn't him. 
[03:56:00]  It was him.  Is that confirmed?  Dude, it looks just for you like him.  Pull it up.  Pull it up there.  It was a really nice Mercedes he was driving to.  You think so?  Eric, did you go with anybody, or did you just show up alone?  No, I drove by myself.  Oh, and then how'd you get home, Roland?  Eric.  Oh, okay, so then you left with Eric.  Okay, that makes sense.  And where's Sal?  I got a question for Sal, too.  He said he's doing work, remember?  He's not doing anything.  But we told him to come in and talk.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's not doing anything.  He doesn't have that much going on here.  Sailboat. 
[03:56:30]  Sail.  Oh, there's sailboat.  That's how she says it.  You can't do your own accent.  That's literally how you say it.  Now you're making fun of you.  Well, I'm just going to say boat at the end of it, so at least it sounds like I got a little  nickname for him instead of just my awkward sail.  My God.  Okay, here it is.  I'm looking at this vine.  I'm driving down the road.  We screamed.  That looks like Quran.  I'm telling you, that was goddamn all the river.  We screamed.  What'd you scream?  Oh.  Oh, uh. 
[03:57:00]  Jesus Christ, there's a party going on.  Listen to the girls.  And then we invited him out to the party.  Yeah.  You invited Geraldo.  To the compound.  Yeah.  Geraldo Rivera.  Yes.  Yeah.  Hang on.  Hang on a second.  Geraldo!  My compound!  Did he just wave?  Yeah.  Anthony, too.  Yes, we'll party.  Geraldo!  Geraldo!  My compound!  Yeah.  Did he wave?  So is he acknowledging?  He's been doing this the whole time.  So it is Geraldo. 
[03:57:30]  Dude, I'm telling you, that was him.  Yeah.  And the picture that Anthony posted on his Twitter was like, it's almost like the Bigfoot sighting.  Like, really, like, analyzing.  It's this grating photo.  He's always in motion.  Yeah.  But we pulled up.  We looked at him.  That was goddamn Geraldo Rivera.  There's one we didn't film.  But we were like, Geraldo!  Who did you ride with, Sal?  I was in the back.  I was in the...  You were with Troy?  The love boat, whatever you want to call it.  Oh my God.  So how was Troy's driving?  It was fun.  Scary?  Yeah.  Was Roland being a pussy or was it scary?  Roland was being a little bit of a pussy. 
[03:58:00]  He was.  Come on.  It's a fucking pre-ex.  It's not a fast car.  Jesus Christ.  There's way too many people in your car.  And look at...  Troy's just in the driver's seat sitting pretty.  So who got the passenger seat?  I did.  Yeah.  My knees were to my chest.  Troy put his girlfriend...  He crammed his girlfriend in the back seat.  She offered because...  I mean, putting Roland back there.  You couldn't do it.  You'd have to put two people in the front seat.  Roland, you took advantage of her good nature.  Perla was an angel.  The question I have for Sal is...  Yeah.  After this party...  Because a lot of things change at parties.  Especially socially. 
[03:58:30]  You know, they can do a lot to build and destroy relationships.  You know, we heard that girl that Pat from Munaki brought...  Was, you know, yelling and crying and all this stuff.  My question to you is...  We never got into it because so much has been going on.  But you and Denny got into this huge fight last week.  And it was a real fight.  It was like...  You could see Denny get fake mad with people.  Yeah.  But I was actually able to get him to...  I've never seen Denny real mad before.  He was mad at you.  He was fucking pissed. 
[03:59:00]  So, after the party...  What's the relationship between you and Denny?  It's kind of like what it was.  Like, when he was there, it was cool, blah, blah, blah, whatever.  You yelled at him when you were drunk.  So, yeah, I probably didn't go to you, Rowan.  Hit the post and never this shit, play this song.  I asked him to hit the post at least a dozen times.  Sal had to get out of the pool and yell.  Did you do it politely?  No, like, hit the fucking post already.  At first he did it politely, but...  Then it just became more drunk and more mean. 
[03:59:30]  And then Denny went on this fucking rampage of playing...  Country.  Country music.  Maybe a dozen country songs in a row.  What songs are they?  Turn this fucking shit off.  Chris Atkins.  Blake Shelton.  That's lame.  That's lame.  What about Garth Brooks?  No, Garth Brooks.  Okay, well then that's a huge mistake.  He could do one or two country songs, but he did...  It was a solid half hour of country music.  It was a country block.  What the fuck?  And he yelled enough of this shit.  But that's all good natured.  You know, so you're saying now, kind of the party brings you back to where... 
[04:00:00]  Because Denny, like I said on the show today,  Denny is that Morning Joe character that Jim does here.  It's so funny you said that, because as soon as...  Just before you said it, I turned to Eric and I said,  Regular Joe is Denny.  Right.  Of SiriusXM.  You agree, right, Troy?  Yeah.  Well, see, now here's the problem.  Yes.  Now Denny, because Denny hung out,  and everybody's being friendly with Denny,  now Denny is going to be hanging around the O&A office so much,  because that's what happens when you give...  See, that was my original problem with him.  It's like, you know, I usually say good morning to people in the morning.  Yeah.  But you just give him a little bit, 
[04:00:30]  and then he just has to constantly be in your face.  Well, I'll tell you, he used to walk around whistling like a fucking bird everywhere he went.  Yeah.  And he stopped doing that since we talked about it on the air,  how annoyed everybody was with it.  Yeah.  So, and he listens.  He's listening right now, I'm sure.  Oh, yeah.  But here's what happens.  The first time, you guys remember, the first time he was on O&A,  everybody loved him.  So all of us that were annoyed with him all loved him, right?  And then as time went on, people started to build annoyances back up, 
[04:01:00]  and then you, Sal, ended up in a big fight with him.  So I feel like now, maybe after this party,  you're back to the place around the time when he first showed up on O&A,  but that annoyance is going to build a lot quicker this time.  There's a little bit of a stigma still, for sure,  because I'm the only person who was actually genuinely able to get Denny pissed off.  And you like that.  To some degree.  You do.  You do.  You take a bit of pride.  You've spent so much time on this show with people telling you what you don't do well.  Yeah.  You found something, and you're like, you know what? 
[04:01:30]  God damn it.  I'm good at this.  I'm good.  Yeah.  And now, like, prior to the party, before everything's like, the smoke was cleared, let's say,  he would come in and consistently try to argue his point.  Boy, the thing was, and we'll get into it very briefly, because we only got a couple minutes,  but when David Lee Roth was in, he said hi to David Lee Roth.  And apparently, that's a no-no, because Sal told him, Denny, don't come in here and say  hi to our guests anymore.  Yeah, it's fucking annoying. 
[04:02:00]  And Denny said, you don't tell me what to do.  I'm not an intern.  And then they just went back and forth.  It was tense, wasn't it?  It was extremely tense.  It was real.  But he came in later, and he said he did say hi to some other famous guest, and they didn't  get mad.  So, bear in your face.  I mean, really, it was inappropriate.  It's highly inappropriate.  I feel it's inappropriate.  I feel like you don't work on the show.  And even if you do work on the show, you know the time and place to go say hi to somebody.  And you should probably clear with Roland first, like, hey, is it cool if I say hi to  David Lee Roth quick?  Or even if Denny were to do that, if you were to say, hey, Roland, do you mind if I say hi 
[04:02:30]  to him real quick?  But just to walk, think that just because you're in the building and you're entitled to talk  to whoever's here, I don't know.  I feel like that's...  What if, hypothetically speaking, and everything went fine with David Lee Roth and Denny.  Sure, of course.  Everything was cool.  He's Diamond Dave.  But what if, hypothetically speaking, what if Denny came in and said something, the wrong  thing, and he just said, you know what, fuck this, I'm leaving.  That would have been bad, but I don't know what Denny would have said that would have  done that at the same time.  Sam, he's irritated every single person in this building over time.  He probably has the ability to irritate a celebrity.  Maybe.  Maybe you're right. 
[04:03:00]  Absolutely.  I backed that up wholeheartedly.  You do.  He's irritated everybody.  And you don't agree with Sal all the time.  No, but I agree with him wholeheartedly on this.  I'm looking at him back because we were coming back from commercial, and then Denny goes,  hey, David, crow nuts.  And David goes, what?  What's the crow nuts?  Roland's literally trying to get David into the studio.  I was like, I'll explain to you as we walk.  He goes, great.  Why do you hear crow nuts?  So, everybody's on the list for the next compound party.  Is that exciting?  Yeah.  It'll be a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  E-Rock, you're on the list, too.  Now, from now on, Eric, now that that party was thrown at, Nagelfest was thrown at the 
[04:03:30]  compound, when Ant says open invite, are you going to take that to mean that you're  invited, too?  I believe so, yes.  I think you should.  I think you ladies should.  Sal, I feel like you're on the open invite list now.  If he invites me again, I'd gladly be there.  If he said, you know, the crew can come, all the guys, you know, you know who you are,  would you go?  I'd follow up with that.  You'd say, Ant, do you think it'd be okay if...  Yeah, I'd just...  Am I one of the guys?  I'd just politely ask.  That's good.  Yeah.  That's a good move.  That's the right thing to do. 
[04:04:00]  Troy, you'd go.  I'd follow up as well.  You'd follow up, yeah.  He told me at the party is coming in time.  Roland, you'd just show up.  I'd show up.  Well, hopefully this time I'll be able to make it, because I'd love to give my insightful  commentary on it as well.  Speaking of insightful commentary, Ron and Fez are coming up next.  I'll be on the crossover Michelle Beatles show, 6 p.m. Eastern tonight on NBC Sports.  So watch that, and we'll see you tomorrow.  Goodbye.  The Opie and Anthony show is now over. 
[04:04:30]  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  And catch Opie and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
