<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a humorous, fictional announcement about a "ONA virus" outbreak.  Patrice O'Neal co-hosted, filling in for Jimmy Norton.  The main topic initially revolved around the hosts' unsettling experience in Cleveland, Ohio, which they described as eerily deserted, prompting a debate on whether it deserved city status.  This segued into a discussion of video games, specifically *Dead Rising*, *Grand Theft Auto*, and *Halo*, including detailed descriptions of gameplay, weapons, and frustrations with game mechanics. Callers shared their video game experiences and favorite weapons.

The conversation then shifted to movies, focusing on Rotten Tomatoes reviews and contrasting opinions on Clint Eastwood films, particularly a lengthy critique of *Million Dollar Baby* and humorous re-imaginings of more upbeat endings for various movies.  A discussion followed regarding the appropriateness of filmmakers of different races directing movies about certain ethnic groups or historical events, which included the use of racial slurs and offensive stereotypes.  This transitioned into a detailed analysis of Clint Eastwood's *Play Misty for Me*, including reading dialogue excerpts.

A significant portion was dedicated to sports, specifically baseball and football, including a discussion of A-Rod's struggles with the Yankees and suggestions for speeding up baseball games.  Football was ultimately declared superior.  A prominent feature was the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest, aimed at finding the heaviest woman, with the hosts using vulgar language to encourage participation and brainstorming increasingly outlandish promotional ideas and incentives.  Listener calls covered the sports and "Fatty Pig Fatty" debates, with Patrice O'Neal promoting his stand-up shows.  A 1975 "Picking Up Girls Made Easy" guide was teased but not fully played.  Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson's rumored relationship was also discussed, alongside a running gag about Opie's ringtone. Sponsors including Dish Network and H57 Hootia were mentioned.

Further segments included appreciation for a staff member ("Happy Typing Girl"), more discussions about the "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest,  Patrice O'Neal's views on aging women (using car and sneaker analogies), and excerpts from the offensive 1975 pick-up artist tape.  Ziggy from MyRadioStore.com was in studio.  Listeners called in, with one offering to bring a 470-pound woman to the studio.  The hosts attempted to have studio guests ride children's bicycles to the XM studio.  The MacBook giveaway contest judging was discussed, featuring disagreements between the hosts and a judge, Danny, and ultimately revealing the winner.  The hosts also discussed Imus and Mark Turnoff.  The segment ended with off-color jokes and anticipation of the cold weather on their walk to the XM studio.

A segment focused on the perceived attractiveness of Black actresses to white audiences across different eras, referencing Halle Berry, Megan Good, Christina Milian, Gabrielle Union, Uma Thurman, and Angelina Jolie.  This transitioned into discussions of sex scenes in "Quest for Fire" and "The Bounty," and the attractiveness of the actresses in those films.  Callers contributed, with one making a comment about Black women having children for financial reasons and another (Mafia Life Chris) making an offensive joke.  The MacBook giveaway judging continued, featuring extended debate.  A Black male caller shared his listening experience and his wife's reaction to the show's offensive content, leading to a lengthy discussion about racial dynamics, focusing on how Black men are perceived and treated differently in various socioeconomic contexts. This involved multiple callers (Tony and Brian), and detailed stereotypes and anecdotes relating to Black culture, consumerism, and social interactions in different NYC neighborhoods. The discussion included extensive use of racial slurs and offensive language and ended with a humorous discussion about how far uptown each host could comfortably walk.

A further segment featured calls from Doug in Baltimore and Dane Cook.  The conversation started with accents, moved to slang terms for drugs, and Doug's observations about the behavior of Black men driving.  Dangerous neighborhoods and drug use (Sherms and Love Boat) in Baltimore and D.C. were discussed, along with the contrast between affluent possessions and dilapidated living conditions.  Sean, a fireman, questioned this contradiction, leading to Patrice O'Neal's explanation through the lens of economics and lack of "burden of ownership."  The discussion covered navigating dangerous situations in urban environments, comparing Los Angeles and New York City, and racial tensions.  Dane Cook's call shifted the conversation to his career, relationship with Patrice, rumors about his personal life, comedic style, and early adoption of MySpace.  Bobby Kelly's career path was discussed, along with Patrice’s improved financial situation.  A brief discussion of Dave Attell's potential role in the *Transformers* movie and Jessica Alba's attractiveness was included.

Finally, a segment featuring Dane Cook focused on his success, particularly his near-sold-out Madison Square Garden show, with the hosts repeatedly mocking his physique.  Patrice O'Neal also promoted his stand-up appearances.  The "Line of the Day" segment (sponsored by BodogFights.com) was featured, with Patrice winning.  The hosts discussed their appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and the broadcast ended with their usual closing banter, including complaints about their anniversary show and future plans, filled with profanity and vulgar humor.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the Opie and Anthony show on XM202 featuring Opie, Anthony and James Norton.  We knew this was different.  The infection was everywhere.  It was in the street outside.  It was coming through your windows.  It was a virus.  Terrible viral infection gives people this incurable disease.  Fills their veins and blood with their pure rage.  By the time they tried to evacuate the cities, it was already too late.  Jesus Christ, five hours?  It infects, replicates and kills this fast.  These numbers can't be right.  The numbers are correct. 
[00:00:30]  I wish to God they weren't.  It's that one.  There is no God.  It's like some kind of horror movie.  It's such a great virus that you want to infect others like your friends and co-workers.  Sometimes it leaves pustules.  There's nothing you can do about it.  God almighty.  We need to stop this outbreak before it mutates.  They're highly contagious.  What's this rash from?  We're facing a new strain.  It can cause life-threatening bleeding or even asphyxiation.  Where is it spreading?  All over the place.  All right.  We're coming out. 
[00:01:00]  Here we go.  I'm a boredom.  Anthony.  I'm a little dirty.  Wipe me.  James Norton.  Boom.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That was a mistake. 
[00:01:30]  It's Friday.  Friday.  It's Friday.  Open your mouth.  They're paying for it.  You eat it.  Me so horny. 
[00:02:00]  The hell was that?  Hey, good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus.  Slowly but surely spreading across America.  Indeed.  We don't have little Jimmy Norton today.  He's at the improv in West Palm Beach all weekend long.  I think he had a show last night, matter of fact. 
[00:02:30]  I'm sure we'll get rave reviews for little Jimmy.  We always do.  We get to sit in the same seats day after day.  Yeah, he gets to, uh...  He gets to travel.  Gallivant around the globe.  He gets to take, uh...  Pretty much every Friday off.  Yeah.  For the next few months.  Hoo-hoo.  That's a good job, right?  Is that what he's doing?  Every Friday?  I think so, yeah.  And then he gets to go to Cuba.  What the hell is that all about?  I don't know, man. 
[00:03:00]  We gotta get that deal.  Why don't we go somewhere and leave him here?  A couple of fill-ins.  That would be good.  Slappy and Wappy can sit here and do a show with little Jimmy Norton.  Good news, though.  We have Patrice O'Neal in studio.  Uh-oh.  You hear some people groaning?  Why?  Some people probably...  Uh...  All he's gonna do is yell and laugh.  Dude, I can't stand...  I'm just tuning out.  Tell me when he's gone.  I don't get that feedback. 
[00:03:30]  There's a couple of them.  Really?  I swear I gotta know.  Dude, if...  Sometimes I look at that dumb website with one eye open.  But I'm used to it from Tough Cry, you know.  Gotta be.  I'm just too loud and...  You gotta be.  I really am a...  I'm every dumb white guy's worst nightmare.  You know, I'm semi-intelligent.  I'm good-looking.  Big, giant.  I can rob you.  I'm a lot of things...  Just rob you without a weapon.  White guys don't like.  And then, like, they go,  I don't like him.  And his girl goes,  I think he's kinda...  He's alright.  I think he's funny.  He's kinda...  I be kissing that King Cole over here. 
[00:04:00]  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmm.  Good morning, Cleveland.  I could just see how a white girl  could find him attractive.  That's all I'm saying.  Yeah, we're still obsessed with Cleveland.  We love our listeners in Cleveland.  We're just trying to figure out downtown.  I don't...  That's all I want to figure out.  There's no figuring it out.  I want to figure out downtown.  We have figured that LeBron James  has gotta be the greatest human being ever 
[00:04:30]  because he had a chance to leave Cleveland.  Somebody should hit Cleveland  with the outbreak bomb.  Just get rid of the few that are left.  Just...  Just clean it up.  I...  They should have American Idol for cities.  Yeah.  Like, after, like, your 50-year lease,  you should have to compete for...  to be a city  because there's some other places  that you really should be a city  before Cleveland.  That are towns.  There's some townships  who are ready for...  Ready for the jump.  ...the Cleveland spot as a city.  Ready for the jump to city-dom.  The Morristown Cavaliers. 
[00:05:00]  Morristown.  Well, Patrice is a big NBA guy,  and I'm saying,  tell me a worse city  in the NBA than Cleveland.  And I'm not talking about the team  just to play there  because LeBron James  could have went anywhere.  His contract was up.  It's his hometown.  It's like you're from Long Island.  If you were a hockey fan growing up,  if the Islanders weren't the best team  in the National Hockey League,  you still would want to play there.  Depending on their opening game there.  You would still want to play 
[00:05:30]  in your hometown.  If I play basketball,  I want to play Celtics.  You know what I mean?  No matter how bad it might be,  but he lives in a compound somewhere  with 85 women  running around like Doberman Pinchers.  Oh, that's his own city.  Here's Charlotte.  Oh, yeah.  He was born and raised.  That's like the Vatican, though.  Like, it's its own entity.  Like, it's LeBronville.  He doesn't have to go out.  All his friends,  all his family,  and every 9 1⁄2 to 11 chick 
[00:06:00]  running around Cleveland,  every color,  is at his fingertips.  Yeah.  And the rest can go out  to that zombie town.  It is.  It's like the set of a video game  or a zombie movie.  But see, we're not being fair  because every time we get  to go to Cleveland,  they throw us in a hotel  in downtown,  which everyone knows  is just a mess.  Yeah, but downtown is what it's downtown.  That's where the action  is supposed to be happening.  Not on the outskirts.  Everyone goes,  you got to go to the outskirts. 
[00:06:30]  That's where the people are.  No, downtown.  You go, like,  like, that would be saying,  well, it's Midtown Manhattan.  You got to kind of go  to the outskirts.  That's where the people are.  No, it's the middle.  That's where the industry is.  That's where the people  are supposed to be.  Yeah, but that's what happens  with cities in general.  All of a sudden,  an area gets dead,  and then they start  building up somewhere else.  I don't know where they're building up  somewhere else yet.  That's all.  No other town  do they say they're downtown?  No.  Nowhere.  We walked out of the hotel.  We're talking about this again 
[00:07:00]  because we haven't seen Patrice  since our ONA Travel Environment  Show in Cleveland.  We walked out of that hotel,  and it was scary.  You could run into the street  blindfolded  and without danger.  There's no danger  of getting hit by a car  or nothing  because there were no cars.  There were no people.  And odd,  very odd,  I found,  I did not see one child,  like a family  with a child  walking down the street.  Like they've given up  on procreating. 
[00:07:30]  They were all eaten  in level one.  You gotta kill them  in level one.  They're the easy one.  They were all killed.  They come out  with like a little  rattle weapon  that's easy to...  Cleveland should have  that thing  on the Star Wars movies  that come up  before the movies.  The scroll and tell you  what happened.  The scroll and tell you  what happened to Cleveland.  All the children  were killed  in episode six and a half.  A once mighty city,  Cleveland. 
[00:08:00]  Now kill the teenagers.  Once a rebel hotbed.  When the Imperial Forces  found out,  everyone fled Cleveland  except for the few  that are left.  And in downtown,  no one has a car  newer than 1982.  Anyone else notice that?  I didn't see  one new car.  Just show me  one new car.  I went on stage  and I go,  Cleveland rocks.  And they go,  what?  I go,  do I have to tell you  that was sarcasm?  You know you don't rock.  But they got the  Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. 
[00:08:30]  They should have a statue  of Drew Carey  in the middle of that town  just like Rocky  for putting Cleveland  on the map.  That's the only one.  And it barely put it  on the map  for like ten minutes.  And now it's back  off the map again.  Well,  we're walking around  during rush hour  and there's no rush hour  traffic.  There's no people  on the sidewalk.  They had a 6 a.m.  flight.  I left the hotel  at a quarter to six.  They had,  the theater district  was one theater.  That was,  yeah.  Put a star box  next to you. 
[00:09:00]  You called the pilot.  I'll be there in a minute.  All right.  That's when I looked  out the hotel window.  I saw the theater district.  Like,  what's playing there?  Cats and Beatlemania?  Cats were real cats.  Yeah,  they just throw strays  off the street.  We all just spent  the time in our hotel rooms  watching movies.  Looking out the window.  And when I go to a city,  I like to,  you know,  check it out.  I like to do  a lot of walking.  Yeah.  And now,  you got to add  on top of it,  it's already winter  in Cleveland.  Did you have to make 
[00:09:30]  one reservation  to go to a restaurant?  No.  It was walk right in.  They were so happy  to see you.  Friday night,  happy hour.  It didn't matter.  Oh,  take a seat.  Which table would you like?  We have 46 people.  No problem.  Yeah,  no problem.  No problem at all.  46.  I didn't know what to make.  I'm so glad  you came in today  because I still have,  I'm obsessed by this.  I don't know how many times  I looked out the window  and said,  where are the people? 
[00:10:00]  Where are the people?  It is.  Excuse me,  I want to watch myself  on TV.  Hold on a minute.  Oh,  is this,  I want to,  you like our big girl?  I wonder if she,  that big white girl,  man,  I'm going to get  a piece of her.  She's cute,  but she's a,  she's a,  you know,  she's a,  there you go.  She's very,  they belong on the radio  TV commercial.  Check it out on YouTube.  She was very nice too.  I bet she was nice.  Of course she was.  You know what?  And you get her in regular clothes,  she's a looker.  And she had a very pretty face. 
[00:10:30]  No,  we picked out that dress for her.  She had to try on dresses  and we had to sit around  in a conference room  and go,  nah,  you don't look fat  in that dress.  Yeah,  that doesn't make you look fat enough.  We need you to look like  a real slob,  so try on another dress.  And she really didn't look  like a real slob.  No.  But God bless her.  In black,  you know,  she was looking,  all she had was like a little,  like a gut.  We talked about that.  Yeah,  God bless her.  We talked about how black guys  would like love her.  Right,  right.  Blonde hair,  got the big butt.  She gets play.  We had a bunch of people 
[00:11:00]  in the conference room  and she had to try on outfits  and she had to turn around  and we had to comment  on how slobby she looked  in each dress.  She's like,  she's a kid too.  How old is she?  I think she was only 19,  20.  Delicious.  Self-esteem is probably  in the gutter.  And we're just like,  you know,  doing 80 takes of  We haven't talked to her  since.  Give her a call.  Because all the parts  were filmed separately  because I think they told her  that they were,  you know,  filming a beauty ad  or something.  Well,  she's a model.  She's a plus-size model. 
[00:11:30]  That's what she does.  That's where they found her.  Anyway,  really fast  because we're talking  about Cleveland.  What's this new game  you were talking about?  Oh,  Dead Rising.  We just started talking  about it as that music  started.  Dead Rising.  Dead Rising?  Fantastic.  And I'm into zombie games.  Love zombie games.  And that's why I was like,  this Cleveland thing  just going through the city,  it just reminds me  that zombie games  are always boring  for about 25 minutes.  Just when you get ready  to put it down,  that's when,  and everything's a kid now.  Everything's a child  crawling around  with no bottom half  and just crawling around 
[00:12:00]  in their hand.  Very scary kids.  Okay,  uh-oh.  And that's where it starts.  But Dead Rising  is this dude,  it seems so corny,  but it's a dude  in the mall,  right?  He's a photojournalist  and some poison  makes everybody zombies.  He gets dropped off  in the mall.  You gotta stay alive  for three days  and it's real time  three days,  right?  So,  you get in there,  you gotta rescue survivors,  but some of the survivors  that you gotta rescue  are,  they're bosses,  but they're psychopaths,  they're people  who just gonna kill anything. 
[00:12:30]  So you go,  look man,  I'm not a zombie  and they go,  whatever,  and then the dude's  just throwing axes  at your face.  So you gotta kill him  and then you go,  you feel sorry,  but then you gotta go  get the person  he had hostage somewhere  and take them  through zombie film.  Oh,  there's nothing,  that's a new thing  with games too  that they started  in the past couple of years  where you have to bring people,  get people in the game  with you  and they do nothing  but get in the way,  go too slow,  get themselves killed.  They don't run as fast.  They don't run as fast.  Or they're in the doorway 
[00:13:00]  you're trying to get through  and they're in the way  and you're like,  move!  That's exactly what it is!  You're like,  move you idiot!  You have a come here button,  right?  And you gotta run away  from the door  so he gets to you  and then get in front of him  so you can run in the door.  You wanna kill him yourself.  That's exactly what they get!  You gotta,  I hate having to save people  in a game.  I wanna be me  against whatever they throw at me.  You go back  and they're staring at a tree  like,  what are you doing?  What are you waiting for?  But that's the drama,  the thing that makes this game great  is the drama 
[00:13:30]  of having to bring,  that's the,  you can just have,  you'll get tired of the game  if you're just chopping up zombies.  Yeah.  It,  you have to get these people back.  Oh, how annoying.  The guy with a phone  keeps calling you going,  hey man,  um,  I'm looking at the camera,  there's a,  there's a girl in the,  oh,  oh,  wait a minute,  there's another great part,  when you go rescue the,  the survivors,  they all have their own personalities.  Yeah.  So some you have to carry on your back,  some you have to hold hands with,  and some you gotta fight  for them to come with you. 
[00:14:00]  So this guy,  he has a bat,  and he's like,  you're like,  come on with me,  and he's like,  no.  And you gotta punch him in the stomach,  and he goes,  oh,  you wanna fight?  And if you beat him up too badly,  it'll go,  John has defected.  Now he's your enemy.  Now you gotta,  so you gotta kick his ass just enough  to convince him to come with you.  You gotta kick his ass just right  to convince him to come with you.  Yeah.  That's the,  the Godfather,  the game The Godfather,  has one of the same premises,  where you go in to extort money  from a store owner,  and you,  if he says no, 
[00:14:30]  through your,  like,  you just talk at first,  you go,  hey,  I'm with the Corleone family,  uh,  you know,  you're gonna be paying now us.  And he goes,  no,  I'm not,  so you gotta pull out your bat  and start kicking his ass a little,  but you can't kick it too much.  You gotta go until he goes,  okay,  I'll pay,  I'll pay.  Dead Rising is fantastic.  Well,  we got Greg in Oklahoma.  Greg?  Man,  Dead Rising is a very good game.  They got like a 9-5  in all the game magazines.  God,  I didn't even hear about this one.  Because it's a zombie game.  Zombie games,  kick ass, 
[00:15:00]  yep.  Do they have it for,  uh,  PlayStation 2?  No,  it's 360 only.  Yeah,  that's awesome.  Oh,  in the high definition,  you gotta make sure you turn your box to high def.  You gotta play it on a 65-inch TV.  And it's just,  at night,  and at night,  the lights out.  It's real time,  right,  Opie,  right?  It's real time.  So at,  you gotta,  they go,  okay,  it's so much drama in the game.  It's like,  you go,  you gotta,  okay,  you gotta fight a clown with,  um,  he has two,  uh,  chainsaws.  But you have to fight him,  but the guy calls you while you're fighting and goes, 
[00:15:30]  there's a girl stuck in a,  uh,  a lettuce shop upstairs,  right,  at the mall.  It's this humongous mall with all these different parts.  So you go,  you gotta get her.  But you see the time ticking.  If you don't get her,  the game goes,  you gotta kill the clown,  then you gotta get her back.  Timed event,  too?  It's,  it's time.  I hate timed events.  It's,  it's a good damn game.  That's what killed me about Grand Theft Auto.  Yeah.  It's like,  I'm having fun with the missions,  and then it's like,  okay,  you gotta get to the hospital, 
[00:16:00]  pick this guy up,  and bring him back to this house.  Go.  Tick,  tick,  and the time starts ticking,  and there's pops slamming you off the road.  And you know if the car flips,  it's over,  you can get out,  but the other idiot's just gonna sit in the car and die.  Hey,  when's the next Grand Theft Auto coming out?  I don't know.  We gotta ask Lazloff.  Is there more at all?  Oh,  dude,  we're all in.  We're all in it.  And everybody is in it.  We do voices in it.  Everybody.  Like,  everyone in this room.  All of us.  Everybody.  It's pretty much gonna be the Opie and Anthony game. 
[00:16:30]  I'm not even kidding.  They even grab peripheral players.  Y'all make me sick,  man.  It's like,  y'all,  y'all,  people join in,  but they're not really joined in.  Yeah.  Like,  if E-Rock could do comedy,  he would've did this tour.  Yeah.  He would've been fanning E-Rock and Martini Steve doing shows.  Because why couldn't we get into the game?  Lazlo knows me.  I think we were full up.  I think he doesn't like it,  because he got everybody in. 
[00:17:00]  Are you serious?  I'm not just talking about,  like,  the Opie and Anthony show,  which obviously you're a part of.  He,  he,  he,  he dug,  he dug deep.  He should've gotten you,  he should've gotten you for the one before,  with all the homeboys.  That's the one you should've been in.  Oh,  Lazlo.  He smiles on my face.  That's right.  And Lazlo gives me a,  that's right.  I can't lie to him,  I'm phony too,  because Lazlo gives me a card every time.  I go,  hey man,  a special garbage I have with Lazlo cards in it.  All right,  let's see.  That's what I put out on Mondays. 
[00:17:30]  Let's go to Nigel in Kentucky.  Nigel.  Hey,  I was wanting to say,  Patrice,  that Dead Rising game,  something,  I don't know how many times you've played through it,  but you've got to go through it two or three times  to actually do everything in the game.  I'm up to level 50.  The thing is,  you died.  Like,  if you lose something,  you've got to start over,  but the great thing that they do  is they give you your accumulated strength  that you earned up until the time you died.  So I'm at level 50,  just sliding through the game now. 
[00:18:00]  You get better,  like,  you get stronger,  faster,  you know,  smarter,  you get more blocks where you can save items,  because you have to have items,  because if you don't have,  save items,  like,  you pick up a book,  and a book,  like,  you have to choose a certain book,  and,  like,  if you have a sword,  it'll let you,  the sword will be more powerful,  so you have to have a lot of spaces  to be able to keep the sword,  and keep it,  it's a,  it's a,  it's,  I've played the game 45 times,  man.  That's cool.  I like that it's in real time.  It's in real time. 
[00:18:30]  It's like,  that's a cool concept,  because you spend so many days and months  on a game anyway.  It's in,  no,  no,  it's not like,  it doesn't take 72 hours,  it's just,  it's a,  at night,  right,  you go through this entire thing  where you can't see.  It's just like,  and all you see is the glowing zombie eyes.  Great.  And they,  and the thing that frustrates you  is they grab you  when you're trying to run,  and they chew on you,  and you gotta wiggle the left joystick  to try to get them off. 
[00:19:00]  And there's no cheats.  That's what I don't like.  I'm a cheater.  I,  I really enjoy it.  I hate cheats,  never use them.  You don't use cheats?  Never use cheats.  I love cheats.  See,  if the cheats are there,  you gotta use them.  That's what sucks.  Don't use them.  The cheats are right in front of you  and you don't touch them.  No,  I won't even look.  That's my problem.  I won't even look for them online.  Eventually,  I gotta go with the cheats.  They don't have cheats no more.  That's cool.  They don't,  they let you,  they make you play the game now.  Good.  Bastards with your cheats.  I was bad at Halo for that.  I got through the game in like a day.  Dude,  I beat that game in like five hours of playing. 
[00:19:30]  You cheat and lying ass.  All these guys cheat.  So what?  I use God mode.  Yeah,  God mode.  No unlimited ammo.  Come on.  NBA 2007.  I already created a guy with all 99.  He can't miss.  He doesn't get stripped.  Come on.  You're cheating.  If you play,  it's a game.  Why do people play,  these games are exactly like real life.  I know.  It's like,  the NFL too, 
[00:20:00]  I can't even play it  because you can't do game stuff.  You want to do some,  some radical move  that's out of this world kind of thing.  I want to bomb.  I want to throw the bomb.  That's it.  Can I throw the bomb?  No,  that's all you want to do.  No.  Don taste,  whatever his name is from Atlanta  is the greatest cornerback in the world.  You can't throw a touchdown on him.  Why do I want to play this game?  Why do I want to play this game?  What did you say?  A four,  seven defense.  What did you,  what did you say? 
[00:20:30]  A slot two and seven.  I'm sorry.  Where is the cheat modes?  I just want to say go long.  That's what I'm saying.  I want to run him back  with all speed at 117  and he runs a touchdown.  He runs a 90 yard touchdown every time.  Every time.  Oh yeah.  That's how I live vicariously.  Let me tell you how lazy.  Patrice,  I'm with you.  Hold on,  hold on one second.  Steve in Jersey.  Steve,  funny.  Hey,  hey,  Patrice,  I want to know if you got the auger yet  in Dead Rising.  The what?  The auger. 
[00:21:00]  That's the best friggin' weapon  I've ever seen.  Oh,  an auger?  If you stab the zombie  right in the center,  you know the augers  you drill a hole with  like for putting the foot in it?  Oh,  they call it the...  The drill bit looking thing.  Yeah,  they call it,  it's like,  it looks like a chainsaw  but it has a drill on it.  Like a giant drill bit.  And you stick them in there  and it just spins them around  and you walk around  with a zombie on the tip  spinning around  and you're just killing  other zombies.  God,  all these friggin' things  and the arms are flailing off  and you know,  and then of course...  What do you think  the best weapon is on the game?  The very best weapon. 
[00:21:30]  I love the auger.  I think the auger is probably the...  I play that game more  for the fun factor,  you know,  as opposed to just  kind of trying to get through it  but that is like  the funniest thing  I've ever seen.  Auger sounds like a good weapon  but no weapon beats  the gravity gun  in the Half-Life series  now that they got.  This is a gun  which uses gravity.  You could grab people  and hold them up in the air  and then launch them  at other people.  So they're ragdolling  and they're like, 
[00:22:00]  ah,  and there's like five people  coming at you.  You fire one guy  and take out the five people  like bowling pins.  You're a gamer, right?  Yeah.  You're a gamer too, right?  Sometimes.  I saw you on the plane  playing PlayStation.  No, well, I got the PSP  and I...  They'll play like Tetris on it.  Well, no.  What do you think  the greatest weapon  of all time in a game is?  I think the greatest weapon  of all time  of any game ever  is Gatling Gun  to me.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  A game with a Gatling Gun  is the greatest weapon.  For a standard weapon,  that's cool though  but I got to go  with the gravity gun  and there's another game  that I played  where if you don't have  any weapons, 
[00:22:30]  it's almost like  you're a Van Helsing  kind of guy  and you're fighting vampires.  Can't remember the name  of the game  off the top of my head  but I'm sure  someone will come up with it.  You have these spinner things  on your hands  that are just blades  and you can run...  Oh, that's God of War,  isn't it?  No, it wasn't God of War.  It was a vampire game  and you're like Van Helsing  and you'd spin these blades  on your hand  and just run through  crowds of vampires  and flesh and blood flying  and it took no energy,  no ammo, no nothing.  This one,  you were like out of stakes 
[00:23:00]  and other things  to kill the vampires with.  That was a very cool weapon  but got to go  with the gravity gun.  You walk up,  you have no ammo,  no nothing  and you're walking around  and you see, you know,  coming towards you.  You could rip a radiator  off the wall  and shoot it at people  like anything.  Like you see a bunch of  these zombie-like creatures  coming at you  and they're climbing up a ladder.  They're going to climb up  a ladder to get you.  Use the gravity gun  to pull a dumpster  off a second level 
[00:23:30]  of a roof  and it falls right on him.  So this weapon  is like multi-purpose.  And it's the same weight.  Does the game give it  the same weight  that it would be?  Like when you smash  a guy with a dumpster,  he would smash.  Oh, he'd smash.  Yeah, it's all relative.  You go through this one,  I was going through  a wood mill  and you just pick up  saw blades  and lob them at these  and lopping heads off  their arms.  Nothing better though  than picking the actual  people up  and they ragdoll  and you fling them  against walls.  This is amazing.  I'm 36  and I know  you're at least 59. 
[00:24:00]  59.  Do you understand  why it never ends?  We'll never mature.  All right, listen.  I love video games.  We have to take a break.  Everyone is calling  with their favorite  video game weapon.  But first,  Rob and White Plays  before we take a break.  Rob.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hey, Patrice.  What's up?  So I'm thinking  if Jimmy's going to be gone  for the next couple Fridays,  we should start something  called Black Friday.  That'll be Patrice  comes in every Friday.  Black Friday.  Black Friday.  It'll be that too.  Everybody will get sick. 
[00:24:30]  Yeah.  It's Black Friday.  Try to find a cure  for me eventually.  Patrice is our sixth man.  He's going to get  our sixth man award  in the NBA there.  Who's the sixth?  Who's even?  You know six men?  That was the dumbest  white guys.  Right.  That was the dumbest thing  every year in the NBA.  The sixth man award.  The not good enough  to start award.  The not good enough  to start award.  Exactly.  He's so good.  Why isn't he starting?  All right.  We got to take a break. 
[00:25:00]  Patrice O'Neill in studio.  What are we promoting today?  Anything, Patrice?  Yeah, I got a few things  actually today.  Yeah?  I got a stand-up New York.  I'll say it when we get back.  I got a few things.  All right.  It's the ONA virus  spreading across America.  We're doing a show  within a show today.  Doesn't stop  when we go to commercial.  Nah, the pal talkers  get to hear it.  Yeah, the pal talkers  get to hear what's going on  during the commercials.  That's right.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus  spreading across America. 
[00:25:30]  Patrice O'Neill  in for Jim Norton today.  Morning.  We segged right into movies  during the break.  Yeah.  We're talking about video games  and then we went into movies.  Well, Jack Nicholson,  his latest movie  is getting, what,  18 stars.  Oh, I can't wait  to see that.  Everyone is saying  this is good.  What is it called?  Departed?  Departed.  Do you go to Rotten Tomatoes?  I thought Rotten Tomatoes  was for bad movies.  No, Rotten Tomatoes  basically is the,  Brother Wee's  turned me on to this,  it's the greatest  movie review site ever. 
[00:26:00]  Because they take  all the reviews  from all the major papers  in America  and then they give you  a nice average  of what the movie's  going to do.  Right.  Because, you know,  your local paper,  you know,  you might have  one of these movie reviewers  that's too cool  for the room  so you can't really feel  artsy, fartsy guys.  So you don't know  where his head's at.  You don't know  where his head's at.  He's giving, you know,  movies one star  that deserve three or four.  Right.  So with Rotten Tomatoes,  they take all the reviews  and then they give you  one solid rating.  Yeah.  And Departed,  for example,  has a 94% positive. 
[00:26:30]  94?  94% positive review  on Rotten Tomatoes.  That's huge, right?  That's massive.  That means, like,  one guy didn't like  the movie in America.  Yeah, it means  somebody or a couple  of reviewers  didn't like it.  How are these guys?  Nicholson,  the same old,  same old.  Yeah, I don't really  agree with,  they gotta be  one of these idiots  that just,  I can't go along  with the crowd,  I can't.  Maybe the guy  during his regular job,  he, like,  reviews kiddie porn 
[00:27:00]  and there wasn't enough,  you know.  Not enough kiddie porn  in there.  Not enough kiddie porn  in this movie for him  so he had to give it  a bad review.  I used to,  I used to be on,  this one guy  I used to be on,  like,  old white guy,  because I was on  this thing where I  wanted all old white  actors to disappear  and move away  and I was really,  you know what I feel  sorry for now  and I want him  to make a comeback  is that damn  Kevin Costner.  Oh, yeah.  And The Guardian  got such a  disgusting review  and it's just like,  I really feel bad  for him because  it's like, 
[00:27:30]  big comeback movie.  He really is  the Brett Favre of acting.  But in the 80s  and early 90s,  that guy was making  these epic movies  that a lot of people  would say,  oh,  it's too long  and everything  but anytime they're on  I'm watching it.  I love that Postman.  I love Waterworld.  I love,  yeah.  The Postman.  The Postman was a great movie.  Silverado was the greatest  Western ever.  It's the best Western  I've ever seen.  Silverado and then  the one with  Clint Eastwood.  The Good,  The Bad,  The Ugly?  No,  none of his  none of the spaghetti ones. 
[00:28:00]  The one with Gene Hackman  and Morgan Freeman.  Oh,  The Unforgiven.  Or Unforgiven,  whatever.  Yeah,  that was a great movie.  It was great  but I loved  The Postman.  All those,  wait a minute,  you just called me out  saying I don't like  Clint Eastwood?  I didn't like his,  that fight movie.  I thought you didn't  like him now  as a like a,  I hate Clint Eastwood now.  All right,  then what's your  mad about?  Unforgiven is  pretty old now,  bro.  It's about,  that's at least  10 years old.  At least,  99, right?  That's when he was still, 
[00:28:30]  No way.  That's when you could still  put him in the western attire  and he didn't look ridiculous.  Yeah,  no,  it changed for me  when he's soaping up  in Bridges of Madison County.  Oh,  yeah,  I got dragged to that movie.  Oh,  that goddamn chick flick,  Bridges of Madison County.  I got dragged to that  piece of crap.  When he's out by the well  and he's got his shirt off  and he's washing himself  and what's her name there  is,  Meryl Streep,  is in the window  watching him  and slowly touching  her shoulders  and running her hands  down her body, 
[00:29:00]  getting all hot  and he's just a mess.  He's off.  He's like an old leather person.  Old man.  Yeah,  there's baloney boobs.  What she was doing,  what she was doing,  she wasn't getting off on him,  she was touching her shirt off.  She was touching herself.  I feel the same way he looks.  I got the heebie-jeebies  looking at him.  I feel leathery.  Are you ready to feel old?  Unforgiven,  1992.  Oh,  okay.  Is that 92?  That's an old movie now.  That's an old movie.  Is that considered old? 
[00:29:30]  Yeah.  Yeah,  because someone born then  is how old?  A teenager right now.  14 years old.  Yeah.  But no,  Unforgiven I consider new.  And let's get real.  Unforgiven was an amazing  Clint Eastwood movie,  right?  After that,  it was in the line of fire.  Great movie.  Which was a good movie.  Great movie.  A Perfect World,  Bridges of Madison County.  I liked A Perfect World.  That was good.  Which one was that?  And that was Cosner.  That was Kevin Cosner  with the little kid.  That was a Clint Eastwood movie?  He kidnaps the little kid.  That was a Clint Eastwood movie?  Yeah.  Clint Eastwood was a,  you can't. 
[00:30:00]  I'll give you that.  That was a good movie.  All right.  That's amazing, man.  And then you go  Absolute Power,  True Crime,  Space Cowboys.  That was awful.  Blood Work,  and then that  freaking fight movie  that everyone loved.  I couldn't stand  Million Dollar Baby.  It made me,  it was the most  unnecessary.  You shouldn't be  that sad at a movie.  How much more depressing.  Unless it's real.  Unless they do a movie  of someone who actually,  but even if it's real,  it's like,  you know what?  At least when she dies,  put her in a robot chair 
[00:30:30]  or something.  But it's like,  for half the movie,  I watched her deteriorate  into the bedpan stuff.  It was like,  why do I have to watch this?  Why?  When is this going to turn for me?  No.  Then he leaves.  Here's what I hate.  I don't like when a character  leaves a movie,  and at the end of the movie  it doesn't go,  it doesn't tell you  what happened to the character.  Just a little line.  What do you want?  The friggin'  Animal House ending?  Yes!  I want Animal House.  I want that ending  for every movie.  Bluto married him.  All right, Bluto.  All right, baby.  Here comes Senator Blutarski. 
[00:31:00]  That's what you want,  the Animal House ending.  He went crazy in Vietnam.  The Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  Jeff Spicoli spent the reward-wanted money  hiring Van Halen  to play at his birthday party.  Is that all, Jeff did?  Damn!  Don't they do?  Because Hollywood has to do their,  Hollywood has to do their thing  and be too cool, you know?  How about this?  Every movie has the Fast Times  at Ridgemont High ending.  After the credits.  Most people are out of the theater.  You like Fast Times at Ridgemont High.  If you want a...  I like it.  Oh, yeah.  I loved it.  If you want that type of ending, 
[00:31:30]  you just sit through the credits  and wait so you can be  taken care of.  I always thought it was  a little silly on a drama.  Like comedies, it's one thing.  But in a drama,  it's kind of silly  to put that ending  what happens to the characters  because it's fictional.  You know what happens?  They turn back into the actors.  They went to their wonderful homes  and had wonderful meals.  No, man.  No.  You got it.  Please give me Blutarski.  You want Senator Blutarski  taking off with the hot chick  in the car.  Oh, man. 
[00:32:00]  Oh, that jerk.  Because he beat him up  early in the movie.  That jerk.  Good.  He died in Vietnam.  And T-Day,  they don't even know where he is.  Good.  Is that pregnant?  Good.  What about the unknown?  Oh, she had a water head?  All right.  Yeah.  Because I didn't like her in the movie.  Oh, the virgin guy  got to go out with the other...  You know what?  That's good.  He deserved it.  Spider bifida?  Damn.  Damn.  I was really liking her.  Yeah, every movie.  Judge Rondhole,  after he splashed that man  in the face with the hot coffee, 
[00:32:30]  what happened to Judge?  What?  What?  He lost a toe  in a lawnmower accident.  Just get stupid.  I love...  You got to have that, man.  I need that.  And that damn...  That million dollar baby, dude,  it...  Yeah, very depressing.  It just should have had a Rocky thing to it.  To make...  But that's what it...  That's where...  Well, you said the chick thing...  That's a feel-bad movie.  The Madison County thing.  It's like, you know women love that.  There's something about that  that women love.  But guys want to see her 
[00:33:00]  knock out the girl  that broke her neck.  She comes back.  She drinks raw eggs.  She beats up a few girls.  Right.  On the way to getting back  the one that broke her neck.  And then it's the old  Rocky Club of Lang thing.  Yeah.  Where, you know,  he goes in there  and just kicks some ass.  Get the music going  and get that montage going.  When she lost her leg...  I want to see your montage.  I want to see...  I said...  When I was watching this, right?  I got sucked into it  and I said,  when she lost her leg  from infection... 
[00:33:30]  Yeah.  I go, wow,  how's she going to come back?  How's she going to come back  and knock the girl  out of the night?  This story's getting good  because somehow  they got to figure out  a way to give her a leg  and get her in the ring again.  This movie's been on  for three hours.  She going to get a prosthetic leg  in the fourth hour?  Nope.  Oh, no.  And then when did you...  When did you start thinking,  uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  I don't think...  Oh, this isn't going to end well.  This isn't going to end well.  What? 
[00:34:00]  What?  Did the parents get the money?  That's the only thing  I think the parents  didn't get the money.  If the parents got the money,  I would have sued Clint Eastwood.  Emotional.  I'm not supposed to go  to the movies for that.  That's something  you're supposed to hear  somebody tell you on the phone  and you go...  I'm sorry to tell you this.  Um, um...  Yeah.  Look, I got to go, man.  All right.  Oh.  And then, uh...  Clint Eastwood is working  on Dirty Harry.  2007.  Oh, no.  And he's playing Dirty Harry?  No, stop it.  Is he mentoring?  He cannot play... 
[00:34:30]  Don't do this.  It's in pre-production.  Who's the star in it?  Because I'm going to tell you  what it's going to be.  It's going to be him  as the mentor  to some new Dirty Harry.  Yeah, new Dirty Harry.  Vin Diesel's Dirty Harry.  Look, you remind me  a lot of me  when I was your age.  A lot of that.  Look, it's a different time  and a different age.  And it...  Is it?  And it's going to be like...  Yeah, pops.  I get it.  All right, old man.  This is how we do it today  in some Fast and the Furious car.  Hey.  Hey, slow down.  I'm getting too old for this.  Yeah, we know.  Remember Colors? 
[00:35:00]  He's like, hey, the cow...  Pac-Man.  Pac-Man.  Dude.  Yo, Pac-Man.  I just happened to have this  in front of me today.  Clint Eastwood's greatest movie ever.  Which one?  Play Misty for me.  Play Misty for me.  This was horrible.  This was a TV movie  from the 70s  where he plays a disc jockey  in this old...  I guess it was a lighthouse  or something.  This was a TV film?  TV movie.  A lot of big celebrities  did TV movies 
[00:35:30]  back in the old days.  A lot of them were good, too.  Simple were the TV movies.  Remember?  Yeah, remember.  The ABC Sunday night movie.  Starring...  And it was like a big event.  Da-da-da-da-da-da.  They don't do that now.  And Brian Denehy  was the number one guy  on the CAS list.  Yeah.  Brian Denehy.  Joyce DeWitt.  In...  You stole my child.  ...stragedy.  In a lifetime exclusive  starring Markie Post.  And the mother 
[00:36:00]  from Family Ties.  The mother  and Joe  from The Facts of Life.  From The Facts of Life.  After losing her breast  to breast cancer,  she thinks she found  the perfect man.  But he turns into  a nightmare.  So he's like...  Starring  Barbara Streisand's husband.  So he's the perfect guy  until halfway through the movie  where he's like...  Just out of nowhere  tells her,  shut up!  And smacks her in the face. 
[00:36:30]  And she goes,  I didn't know he was abusive!  And then he just turns  into some homicidal maniac  and she's got to kill him.  And then it ends  in the courtroom  with her getting acquitted.  Farrah Fawcett was the first one.  The burn in bed.  Burn in bed.  Where she burnt  the husband up in the bed.  In the bed.  That was like a true story  or something.  She's announcing  that she has cancer today  by the way.  Yes.  She wants everyone...  She held a press conference  to tell the press  to leave her alone.  Yeah, she had a press conference  to tell the press  to leave her alone  through this difficult time.  I think she's got... 
[00:37:00]  I think she's got  the poop cancer.  No.  Does she the colon?  I'm not sure.  What kind of cancer  is Farrah fighting?  Poopy cancer?  Oh my...  Jesus.  You got the poopy cancer?  It's not...  Come on, man.  I love your medical jargon, Nero.  Look at, man.  Don't you...  Don't betray somebody  that you know  you've pleasured yourself to  when she was young and hot, man.  That poster?  Come on, man.  That everyone had on the wall?  I liked her...  Even Tony Manero  had that poster on his wall.  Come on, man.  Don't...  I liked her replacement, actually. 
[00:37:30]  Cheryl Ladd?  Cheryl Ladd was...  Yeah.  Back in the day, man.  Cheryl Ladd,  in the Charlie's Angels days,  was unbelievable.  Yeah.  Red dick ass.  But then they got that...  That Terry Hatch...  Hatcher?  What was...  No, no, the other one.  Not Terry Hatcher.  No, not Terry Hatcher.  It was something Hatch.  Some other blonde bimbo.  Like, I'm supposed to remember  the goddamn name.  It's been 30 years.  Starring the mother  from Growing Pants.  You guys want to hear...  You guys want to hear 
[00:38:00]  Clint Eastwood as in...  It was a love she thought  would last forever.  Little did she know  he held a secret.  There was a sinister side  to Alan Thicke.  Oh, any time a guy...  Any time it's anything  with a penis,  it's bad in a Lifetime movie.  Alan Thicke.  Alan Thicke.  You guys want to hear  Clint Eastwood as a DJ?  Yeah, let's do this.  This is Play Misty for me.  TV movie back in the 70s  when they were really big.  I can't... 
[00:38:30]  Are you showing us  a TV movie?  Absolutely.  I was saying that  it was in the movie theater.  No, it wasn't.  I think it was in the movie theater.  I'm telling you.  I will bet any amount  of money right now.  Play Misty for me.  TV movie.  Go to IMDB and we will...  Internet movie database.  Solve this.  If this bill hangs up,  I'll hunt him down.  All right.  Hold on, Bill.  We'll find out.  Hold on, Bill.  Well, the movie is...  Clint Eastwood,  he's a DJ in Carmel, I guess.  Yeah, Carmel.  A little radio station  in the middle of nowhere  and he had to write his poems  for his radio show. 
[00:39:00]  His radio show.  He had to feel the music.  He had to pick out his music  and then he had to play poems  that he wanted to play  in between tunes.  That's what it was.  Who would listen to that drivel?  And then he had the stalker  that all she wanted to hear  was play Misty.  Yeah, play Misty for me.  Play Misty for me.  And it just ends up  with her running into the studio  or his house with a knife  trying to kill him.  Oh, yeah.  And all she'd say was,  play Misty for me.  And at first it was like,  all right, what's your name?  All right, here's Clint Eastwood  on the radio.  Taking requests. 
[00:39:30]  Here he is.  Two for Tuesday.  Here in the lighthouse.  Here he is reciting  one of his poems.  Poems.  Men have destroyed  the roads of wonder  and their cities squat  like black toads.  This sucks.  In the orchards of life,  nothing is clean or real  or as a girl.  That's the PD.  Take it to love  or be a man with.  This is Dave Garver  with a little verse,  a little talk,  and five hours of music  to be very, very nice  to each other.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Clint, yeah. 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Look, we're going to talk.  Can you bring in an air check  into my office?  Because we really got to go over this.  You stink as a jock.  Yeah, but he ends up  throwing her off the cliff  at the end of the movie.  Yeah, that was pretty cool,  but he's the worst disc hockey ever.  Hey, Opie,  the Dirty Harry thing  you're looking at  on IMDb  is the video game  Clint Eastwood  is going to be in.  Oh, he's doing a voiceover for it?  I thought it was  in the movie sector.  Oh, okay.  IMDb, I'm sorry about that.  Oh, it's a video game.  Yeah, that's cool.  Usually you'll just see  a V-O for voiceover.  Here's the broad calling in. 
[00:40:30]  To Clint Eastwood  as he does his radio show.  Men have destroyed  the roads of wonder.  That sounds like my poem again.  Squat like blood, too.  I'm being redundant.  Sorry, sorry.  It's a twofer, I told you.  Caramel, Dave Garver speaking.  Hello.  Hi, what'll it be?  Play Misty for me.  Misty, huh?  We have that right  on the play rack.  Thanks for calling.  That's his request.  Opie, push your fart button for me. 
[00:41:00]  Yeah.  Do the thing when a guy's choking  and doing something.  See, this is what DJs did  before Howard showed us  all what to do.  Yeah, thank God.  You dick.  Yeah.  I invented poetry.  I'm going out to the  Hamptons.  Robin.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  They're ripping me off.  Men are ruining the world  and black toads are coming.  But I invented all that.  Radio is nothing before me. 
[00:41:30]  I'm going to satellite.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Radio is all about  just reading poems.  I have five million listeners.  Before I came along.  Robin.  Now I have to have my  girlfriend fall down  at Madison Square Garden  so they talk about me  in the paper.  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Oh, hoo, hoo.  What'd you do?  What was the last  hoo you did?  Hoo, hoo, hoo.  Oh, man.  Oh, man. 
[00:42:00]  Here's more Clint Eastwood  on the radio.  We'll have more smooth sounds  in just one minute.  First, at ten minutes  to the hour,  we're broadcasting  from KRML  in the Carmel Rancho  Shopping Center,  home of the buccaneer,  The Man's Boutique.  The Man's Boutique  is doing commercial reads.  Cheryl Teagues  was replaced by  Shelly Hack.  Shelly Hack.  Thank you, Ken.  I walked out.  She was horrid.  Thank you, Ken.  And here's one more  Clint Eastwood  dang on the radio.  And now we have  a pretty one  for lonely lovers 
[00:42:30]  on a cool, cool night.  It's the great  Errol Garner classic,  Misty.  And this one  is especially  for Evelyn.  Oh, boy.  He acknowledges Evelyn.  Evelyn.  You want to hear Evelyn?  Even though Clint Eastwood  was just reading poems  on the radio,  he was making enough money  to have a maid.  And this is what  Evelyn did to the black maid.  Oh, God, help me. 
[00:43:00]  Please, somebody help me.  Of course they couldn't swear,  but they could kill  a black woman to death.  Wow.  For a while.  They could stab a black woman  until she really died.  I need a Negro woman  for my movie.  All right, cut.  You're not screaming  hard enough, Negro. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah, he directed this movie.  Uh, let's see.  I don't think they should have  at least two directors  when black people are in movies.  It was his first directorial,  it was his first movie  he directed.  Uh-huh.  Finished shooting  four days ahead of schedule  and $50,000 under budget.  Oh, look at that.  Why is that?  Film completed in 21 days.  Uh, I don't know.  It says nothing about the movies,  but if it was in the movie,  what is this?  In theaters in 71? 
[00:44:00]  Made $10,600,000?  Like, up till when?  Yesterday at Blockbuster?  I don't believe it.  Still not agreeing.  And cut.  Patrice, we need you  to scream better than that.  Can she say mammy?  Don't stab me, mammy.  And stop blinking.  We need your eyes buggy.  I'm new at this directing stuff  and it's throwing the lighting off  every time you open 
[00:44:30]  those big negro eyes.  Listen, I'm not gonna blame anybody,  but the neglet  won't stop screaming correctly.  How can white people direct?  How can Steven Spielberg  direct so many slave movies?  I don't know.  They seem to like it.  Lord Jesus, cut.  Look, come on, let me talk to you.  I've directed Jaws, Duel.  I've done a lot of things.  I know the way  negro's supposed to scream.  Now you go lordy, lordy. 
[00:45:00]  Because that's what they said  back then.  I did the research.  W-D-E-E-L-O-O-D-U-I-L-O-D-L-O-D-O-D.  Black people have no problem  with Spielberg making black movies.  But Spike Lee's got problems  with white people making  certain black theme movies.  Wait a minute.  Spike Lee had made  Schindler's List.  But Schindler's List  had been a Spike Lee joint.  I think he could have,  But I think it would have been completely different, different take on it, different feel. 
[00:45:30]  Oh, Hitler, you better not put me in there.  But let me tell you something.  Neither Steven Spielberg nor Spike Lee were either slaves or in the Holocaust.  So I don't got it.  But who should, okay, who's more qualified to make a movie about Italian family life, me or you?  All right, but I'm in an Italian family.  But these guys were never in the Holocaust.  Because you could do as much research about the Holocaust, and I don't care what color you are, 
[00:46:00]  you're going to be able to make a film about it based on what you researched.  Well, black people innately know what black people did because it's passed through, like certain behaviors passed through black folks.  You think it's in the genetic, in your genes?  Not genetics, but when you was a slave, somebody else, when the last slave was not a slave no more,  he was still slavy enough to talk to the dude that's not a slave.  The next guy.  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  Spike Lee is more slave-y.  Because the Jews were slaves, too. 
[00:46:30]  Spielberg's not as slave-y, even though...  We can't start this now.  Yeah, we've got to go to break.  Seth who beat the mill knew that Yul Brynner knew what an Egyptian was.  We have to take a break.  This is good for after the break.  Because this is another 40 minutes.  Is this slave-y enough?  They're going to kill us down the hall.  It's the only virus spreading across America.  We've got Patrice O'Neal in studio today.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:47:00]  Do, do, do, do, do.  What's up, Detroit?  What's up, Detroit?  They got one up on the Yankees yesterday.  That doesn't make you happy, right, Ant?  Eh, no.  An old broken-down rickety Johnson is pitching there.  You know something when...  I'm-a-coming, I'm-a-coming, but my head is running low.  When you got Joe Torre saying, you know, yeah, well, we don't know. 
[00:47:30]  Until he shows up, we don't know how he's going to pitch, how he's going to feel, if it's going to be...  Because you're starting pitcher when you're, you know...  Why won't him and Brett Favre...  You're 1-1, going to the...  And Vandal Holyfield, just stop.  Going to foreign territory.  You don't have the home field advantage.  And you're throwing in this guy with his bad back, and no one knows if it's going to work.  Oh.  You got bigger problems than that.  What happened to A-Rod yesterday?  Oh, nothing.  What happened to A-Rod?  Another instance of bases loaded and striking out. 
[00:48:00]  But that's you guys...  That's got to be driving you Yankee fans nuts.  As long as you can sign that check.  It's mental, man.  It's mental.  Leave him alone.  Leave that player again alone.  You can't leave him alone.  They're saying he's a joke.  He could be the greatest player in Major League history.  The playoffs start, and...  The choke.  What will get him...  Okay, what will redeem him?  I don't know.  I don't think anything.  A couple of home runs?  I think it's one of those guys.  No one redeems him 18 for 18.  Just an 18 straight hit. 
[00:48:30]  18 straight hits.  No one will remember anything about him choking if he did that.  18 straight hits?  Greatest player ever, ever.  All right, look.  Look at A-Rod.  You listening.  Listen, man.  18 straight hits.  That's all you got to do.  How hard could it be?  Yeah, but what's the big deal?  What's the big deal?  Come on.  People hit the ball all the time.  I didn't say get rid of A-Rod.  I didn't say get him out of there.  No one on the team.  A lot of Yankee fans.  Did you read that sports illustrated?  I'm mad at him.  Hey, really fast.  I just want to acknowledge the Mets had a great game yesterday. 
[00:49:00]  Yeah, they did.  You know, Major League Baseball is alive and well.  It's Dodgers.  And the Cardinals defeated the Padres, whatever.  Who cares?  That's like a who cares series.  Oh, baseball.  And then hockey started, freaking basketball, right around the corner.  Hockey's been going on for six months now.  No one cares about hockey.  Nobody.  I'm a huge hockey fan, but the weather has to be cold for me to officially enjoy it.  It's like, you know, it was 85 degrees in New York the other day, and, you know, hockey's starting. 
[00:49:30]  Here's what a hockey score on the news should always sound like.  It should always begin with, oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, before I forget.  Oh, yeah.  The Scooterville honey drips just beat the Islanders.  Oh, since we have a little extra time, let me give you a hockey score.  Why don't you like hockey?  It is the most exciting game to watch.  Do me a big favor.  Why does no one like hockey? 
[00:50:00]  Hockey.  Hockey has.  Hockey is the bastard child of hockey.  The Stanley Cup.  The Stanley Cup final.  Lord Stanley's Cup.  Nothing beats playoff hockey.  I'm telling you.  It's much more exciting than playoff baseball.  Freaking these games go six and a half hours.  No one's with you, Opie.  Nobody.  Yeah.  What?  Nobody.  So, save the energy?  Ray Bork.  Save the energy?  I was ready to go.  I was ready to go.  Mario Lemieux is not even hockey.  Much more exciting than freaking playoff hockey.  Pick your fights.  Dude, I tried to watch the Met game yesterday. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  It was 10 o'clock, and it was the bottom of the second.  Oh, Jesus.  I mean, what is that about?  They've already made their fifth pitching change.  Baseball is all for two.  Let me tell you something.  All sports should be over when football is on anyway.  Football is the only sport, then basketball, then baseball, but baseball sucks so bad.  Look, I don't know if this is.  Baseball, they should have a rule.  You have to pitch the ball every two seconds.  Wow.  Stop making it look like the pitchers are that important. 
[00:51:00]  Just throw the balls in so you get some hits.  So they should put time in baseball?  Dude, a minute between pitches for what?  It just takes a long time these days.  For what?  And the amount of times they change the pitcher these days, and a lot of stuff going on that  just makes baseball much too long.  Boring.  But I'm not sure if I'm right on this or not, because I'm not a basketball fan, but basketball  season seems to last forever.  It's like you hear about who the champion is, you hear which town is burnt, and then 
[00:51:30]  before you know it, they're back again, and they're playing.  How long is basketball season?  It's the athleticism of basketball that makes it a big hobby.  But the season is too long.  It overlaps every other sport.  I used to be the hugest NBA fan.  I'm hoping LeBron James brings me back to the game.  I mean, the years with Jordan, just unbelievable.  Does Stan know how long the season is?  82 games.  82 games.  Yeah, we know that.  Like how?  It starts at the beginning of November and goes through June.  November to June. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah.  It should, though.  Dude, baseball goes.  That seems long, then, because it's, you know why?  Baseball is 104 million games.  Baseball already started preseason, even though the season's not over.  I'll tell you why, then.  How about that?  Because it's winter, and winter just seems long.  How about that?  Right fielders have to already check in in Florida.  Nothing?  That's a good joke.  Jesus.  Jesus.  The Yankees.  I heard it.  The Yankees.  That's a good joke.  I don't even know what's a bad season, because they're like, well, they're only 86 and 79. 
[00:52:30]  What?  They're only 86.  They've won 86 games?  That's two more games than the whole NBA season.  You know what?  That's why football truly rules.  There's 16 lousy games.  And they only mean something.  They play once a week.  There's only eight home games, so every play means something.  It's already the fourth week, right?  Or is it the fifth week coming up, or is it the fourth week coming up for football?  Football?  We're up to five.  It's the fifth week.  Get out of here.  Five weeks.  It's already.  It's already important.  It's almost all.  Yeah.  Football.  Yeah.  It's all. 
[00:53:00]  0-3 is an important.  0-3 in baseball is not good unless you're 0-63.  If it's possible, you can go on a 63-game winning streak.  That's so true, man.  Yeah, we're arguing sports.  Nothing beats football.  16 lousy games.  That's it.  I watched it.  Did you watch any of the games last week?  I don't know what you're about to talk about.  The Jets game was amazing.  It was seven amazing games on.  Yeah.  Football is unbelievable. 
[00:53:30]  It's emotional, man.  That run back for the Jets.  103 yards, buddy.  And then Peyton Manning coming all the way back with no timeouts and just much.  And you know what?  You knew he was going to do it.  That's why it's so frustrating.  Oh, my God.  I'm sitting at home going, wow, that was exciting that we just ran the ball back 103 yards.  But Peyton Manning is now going to freaking get him a touchdown.  Football is more exciting than I watched on television.  The guy Maroney for the Patriots just stiff-arming grown men as if they're little kids. 
[00:54:00]  And Reggie Bush has done nothing this year yet.  He hasn't even broken an exciting run yet.  Reggie Bush, the whole reason we're watching football this year.  He's done nothing, and this is the greatest season I've ever seen.  Football is unbelievable.  Who cares about the Yankees?  Well, it's the playoffs.  Basketball, how often do the teams play?  It's not like baseball is ridiculous.  About three times a week.  About three times a week? 
[00:54:30]  Because baseball, I notice sometimes if you don't keep tabs, especially early in the season,  you don't keep tabs on the games, and you hear like, well, the Yankees can't seem to break  this eight-game losing streak.  And it seems like the next day you turn it on and go, Yankees on a seven-game winning streak.  You know why they want a seven-game winning streak?  What just happened?  Because they played two games.  Because they played seven games that day.  Baseball stinks.  They had to make up a few rain delays.  Any sport where you could play the same game twice in a day.  Could you imagine football? 
[00:55:00]  You're done playing the game, all beat up, and it's like, all right, guys, do it again.  One more time.  And here's a question.  There'd be deaths on the field.  This may be so stupid, but how do you win at baseball?  Like, how are you good, and how are you not good at baseball?  What is it that makes you a good team?  I love when a World Series goes seven games, and the last game, it's like the last out guy  hits a homer to win the World Series, let's say, okay? 
[00:55:30]  And the losing team of that World Series has to restructure their entire organization because  they lost the World Series, when it probably turned down to be a luck play at the end of  the game.  That's my point.  Like, baseball seems so lucky.  That doesn't make sense to me.  Like, a lot of luck involved in baseball.  There's a lot of luck, and if the luck doesn't bounce in your favor, then the next year you've  got to restructure your entire team, fire everybody, get rid of the whole pitching.  Because you blew it.  Right.  You didn't have luck.  Thank you.  I've noticed that for years. 
[00:56:00]  I'm like, what?  Why don't you do it?  I think your team's pretty good.  Why don't you keep the exact same team and see what happens next year?  Alex Rodriguez, right now, is just unlucky.  He ain't bad.  It's just unlucky.  How can you suck at baseball?  How can you just go, you know what?  I forgot.  In basketball, I hurt my knees and can't jump as high.  Football, I busted my bag.  I can't move as quick.  Baseball, what?  You think just the guys that break all the records and are in the Hall of Fame and everything  are just lucky guy?  Just lucky.  It's like, here's the bat of another lucky guy. 
[00:56:30]  All those Puerto Ricans and Pete Rose, they were just lucky.  And Pete Rose should be in the Hall of Fame, by the way.  Of course he should.  Hey, you know football, Patrice?  Yeah.  Did you do my picks this week?  Let me see.  We got $10,000 up for grabs.  Go ahead.  And here's the deal.  The guys behind the scenes, they're doing football picks the entire season.  Okay.  And whoever wins at the end of the year is going to win $10,000, courtesy of what?  Dish Network?  The football picks are sponsored by, yes, Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-1888. 
[00:57:00]  Get Dish.  Did I have too many 8s in there?  Yeah.  1-888-GET-DISH.  Okay.  There you go.  Patrice, I'm in second place because I'm doing this as well as the goof factor.  And if I win, I'm taking the $10,000 and I'm throwing it out of a helicopter somewhere.  Can you throw out a helicopter in Jersey City now?  Right over your head.  Right over your head.  One brick.  Land on your lawn.  Jesus.  And, dude, I don't care if you try to screw me or what.  Here's the football picks.  All right.  Give me this.  Washington Redskins at the Giants. 
[00:57:30]  All right, here.  Just circle who you think's winning right now.  Okay.  Say the game and who's winning.  I'm in second place by just having people do my picks and picking them out of a hat blind  and everything.  I will tell you right now, Washington Redskins against New York Giants.  The Giants lose badly.  They stink.  Okay.  Here we go.  They are horrendous.  Dallas Cowboys are going to beat Philadelphia.  Wait.  You're circling the teams that are losing.  No one does it that way.  Oh, sorry.  Washington Redskins win.  No one does it that way. 
[00:58:00]  W.  Dallas Cowboys against Philly.  Dallas wins, definitely.  Oakland Redskins.  What?  What?  Dallas Cowboys versus Philadelphia Eagles.  Dallas is going to win that game.  The Eagles stink, too.  You don't get...  Oh, my God.  Trust me.  I was going for some upsets this week.  You're killing all my picks.  Oakland Raiders are going to lose to San Francisco.  San Francisco's a better team than Oakland.  Let's be honest here.  Let's see how good he does. 
[00:58:30]  If you want to win...  All right.  Well, thanks for giving me one whole win.  All right.  Ready?  Here's what I'll give you.  I'll give you...  Give me my Jets.  Give me my Jets.  I'll give you the Jets.  Thank you.  Who are they playing this week?  They're playing the Jaguars.  But the Jaguars just came off a tremendous game against Washington.  They're going to be...  The defense is brutal.  The Jets have no running game.  So why are you giving him the Jets?  Because he wants the Jets.  And I'm going to give him the Jets.  Thank you.  As an upset.  You got to...  You know, nothing ever.  It's a little parody.  Throw it in there.  The Jets are really these gamey kind of dudes. 
[00:59:00]  So it's possible if they score two touchdowns, they can beat Jacksonville.  They can beat Jacksonville.  So I'm going to give you Jets for real.  I'm looking forward to seeing how well you do.  Pittsburgh Steelers and San Diego Chargers.  Pittsburgh is very upset right now because they feel like they got a little bit of disrespect.  I pick Pittsburgh.  Oh, my God.  He picked one whole win.  And this is not a favorite.  San Diego...  I understand that.  ...is a beast.  They love...  So you got two upsets there.  I'm one out of five this week.  You're going to...  Trust me.  Trust me, man.  I've been doing really well. 
[00:59:30]  I'm in second place.  I might win this $10,000.  What was you going to pick, then?  What was different than what you was going to pick on there?  You got to go with Patrice's, though.  Honestly, I would have picked the Eagles in an upset this week.  It won't be an upset.  They're favored to win.  But I don't think...  Well, the Eagles are at home, too.  I think Dallas...  That's a good game.  That's a guarantee win for the Eagles.  T.O. is going to doo-doo all over.  Do you realize...  I think the Eagles have one dude in the secondary.  I think they play with all linebackers. 
[01:00:00]  They're beat up.  Dante Stallworth is hurt.  Westbrook is hurt.  Come on, man.  You got to take Dallas.  We went off on a sports tangent, which is fine.  But people are loving the dirty Howie.  Now you got to try to find it.  Dirty Howie.  I need some feedback.  Dirty Howie.  Oh, man.  What was it?  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo, Robin.  Oh, man.  Did he steal five bits?  In the city, squat like black toads.  Speaking of black toads, Robin with the news. 
[01:00:30]  I just cursed.  Hoo-hoo.  Oh, you cursed over my great line.  I just cursed.  I'm sorry.  Touche.  It was under my breath because this stupid instant feedback updated so fast,  we lost a really good feedback.  And now we're stopping the show to try to find it.  Dirty Howie.  It's funny.  Something about, did he steal five bits or six?  Ah, forget it.  How do I go to the next page? 
[01:01:00]  At the bottom.  Where?  Where?  E-Rock just barking out suggestions from behind the screen instead of getting up and running  over to help master.  All right here.  You're going to get a rolled up newspaper across your snout.  It doesn't even matter now because comedy is all about timing.  Of course it doesn't.  But the feedback said, I know what you're thinking.  Did he rip off six of my bits or only five?  Or only five.  Well, did you, punk?  Someone very pissed off.  Of course it has to come out of Detroit because they had a great win over the Yankees yesterday. 
[01:01:30]  Andy in Detroit.  Andy.  Hey, first thing first though, Detroit loves you.  Thank you, Detroit.  Yeah, I don't know if we're feeling anything in Detroit yet.  I know there's a buzz in Pittsburgh.  I know that's really happening.  There's a buzz in a few other cities.  But Detroit, we're not really sure about yet.  But thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Detroit sucks overall.  I'm trying to leave it, but I'm just telling you, I love you.  All right.  What do you got there?  For baseball, first of all, it's a sport that you're going to have to grow up watching to really enjoy. 
[01:02:00]  Now, the whole luck factor, you've got to be careful with that, fellas, because what's the difference between a guy being lucky hitting a home run on the bottom of the ninth to win the World Series than a guy hitting a three-pointer from 40 feet away to win a six-pointer?  Bad analogy.  Why?  Because you get luck.  Would you say hitting a three-pointer is there's a percentage to that, right?  You don't say, like, I guess it's called slugging percentage or whatever like that. 
[01:02:30]  But out of the one million games, hitting 50 home runs is fantastic.  You can hit 53-pointers in 10 games.  Right.  It's a skill level.  And you use your same skill to purposely try to hit that.  You go to the plate hoping to hit a home run.  Boy, there's three on deck.  We're down by three.  I'm hoping to be a hero.  I just hope my way to, you know, to greatness. 
[01:03:00]  But a three-pointer is a cut.  Put it this way.  Michael Jordan, there's no baseball player who every time he goes to the plate, right, when his team is down one and there's two on the base.  And he goes to the thing and everybody goes, might as well get up because he's just going to hit a home run now.  It's luck.  It's luck.  Well, now would you say then it was luck if the basket was moving in basketball, like if all of a sudden you threw it and, like, the pitcher would throw a curveball at the batter. 
[01:03:30]  Is it erratically moving?  It's just a little bit.  It might slide out of the way a little bit.  But you know the pattern of the move?  Because then it wouldn't be luck.  Because then you could play that, too.  Because then you could play that.  Yeah.  I'm serious.  Why don't you just say, if there's a guy holding his hand in the shape of his hand and going, whoo, you think.  And he can move a little bit.  Why would you change the entire complexion of life?  Because I'm trying to make the game interesting for me.  I don't like basketball.  They do say the hardest thing to do in sports is to hit a baseball.  Of course it is. 
[01:04:00]  Yeah, just ask A-Rod that.  Yeah.  Come on, folks.  All right, we've got to take a break.  During the playoffs.  I don't know.  Another break?  Yeah, it's one of those things.  Yeah, we're having fun today, Patrice.  You're bringing a lot of energy to the show.  You love it.  This show is moving.  What is it with these breaks?  And we've got to do something before you get out of here.  We've got to pay the bills.  This bit has been sitting in front of us for a really long time.  This is the perfect day to do it.  We found some audio of how to pick up girls.  How to pick up girls made easy from the year 1975. 
[01:04:30]  Oh, yeah.  How do you go up to a broad in the street and try to pick her up?  Is it Billy Dee Williams?  First get some malt liquor.  Right.  I love that commercial, him with the malt liquor.  Or how you pick up a broad at the library.  Hey, I got a lot of coochie.  You got some coochie?  You got some coochie?  You got some coochie?  Yeah.  Hey.  By the way, Fatty Pig Fatty is brought to you by H57 Hootia.  Hootia.  Lose weight for free at H57.com.  We met those guys yesterday.  They were great.  No, hootia.  And what's going on with our Fatty Pig Fatty contest?  Uh, we need... 
[01:05:00]  I'm not happy.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm not happy how it's going.  We need to go.  It started off with a bang and now it's just sitting there.  They're just sitting there now.  It's topped out at 430 pounds.  Yeah.  So I think the girls are a little intimidated to come down.  But if you're over 430, why wouldn't you come down for $10 a pound?  We're talking $4,300 that this woman's going to waddle away with if she wins.  Now, if you're out there and you weigh 450, let's say, you're going to come in here for 
[01:05:30]  a few minutes.  We're going to talk about your weight.  That's the reason you're in here.  But we got the pig mask.  We got the paper bag.  $4,500, you dumb fatty.  And you could change the...  Get in here.  Why aren't they showing up?  You could change your name and everything.  Let's go.  Change your name, wear a mask, whatever you want to do.  And we're huge with the truckers because of XM.  I blame the truckers.  Yeah, we know there's some trucker women out there that are fat. 
[01:06:00]  We put the word out to the truckers, find us the fatties.  Bring one by.  I know Philly's trying to get us a fatty.  They got promos running and stuff.  They're trying to find us a fatty.  If you were a guy and you couldn't pay your rent this month or something, go to the corner  bar.  There's always some fat broad waiting to get laid at the corner bar on some weekend.  Tell her the deal.  Go look.  No one for the pounds, though.  That is...  400.  That's a shoddy bar.  That's a bad bar.  That is way...  That's in the house bank. 
[01:06:30]  But you're talking like...  You're going to knock on doors, dude.  Over four grand you could walk away with just for being you.  We did the fatty pig fatty thing live on the stage in Cleveland and everybody, including  the girls, had a great time with it.  Yep.  We gave, what, $500 to the heaviest girl in the audience and everybody had a great time.  We got to come up with some parting gifts for the girls so that way they feel if they  come in here and the girl's 450 pounds and she feels, well, I'm not going to come in  because I know if I come in, some girl's going to come in that's 480. 
[01:07:00]  We got to make it worth their while just to come down.  And how pathetic are we that we're now begging to see fat girls?  We need fat girls.  That's what women do.  It doesn't matter if you're fat or thin.  We have to beg to see you.  We need hot chicks.  We got them down here.  Steve is always knowing some porno broad or Jimmy or something.  We're looking for fat broads.  What the hell are you waiting for?  It's the first time you're wanted.  Come on.  Help us out.  Look at us begging.  If there's a fatty out there that is thinking about coming down, could you call us, please? 
[01:07:30]  He's a fat hog.  Why don't you sit?  Hey, listen.  If there's a beautiful, voluptuous young lady who's a little bit more voluptuous than  she should be, come on over.  We're looking the word out.  We're putting the word out for all you Rubenesque women out there.  You're like, come on down, you uncooked lard, you big fat pieces of bacon.  Come on, you hippo asses.  All talking pigs.  We have a reputation.  Where are you?  You're making us look bad.  Get down here, you fat pigs. 
[01:08:00]  By the way, this will end the basketball three-pointer versus hitting a home run debate right here.  It's Ray in Jersey.  Ray.  Go ahead.  Ray.  Hey, man.  What's going on, guys?  What's up?  Hey, Patrice, I've seen a dog hit a three-pointer, and I've never seen a dog actually hit a baseball  Well, not necessarily three-pointers, but yeah, some of those halftime shows, they're showing  dogs hitting baskets.  Dogs make baskets.  They also, I believe they also have the competitions where any Tom, Dick, or Harry can go out onto 
[01:08:30]  a basketball court and try to make a shot for a million dollars.  People are so dumb.  People are so dumb.  Hockey, they do that.  They try for a million dollars.  They kick a field goal for a million dollars.  I've never seen a competition where a guy has to stand there and hit a home run with an actual pitcher with a pitcher standing there winging a ball out of it 95 miles an hour.  First of all, dogs don't have fingers.  Anything that you need fingers to do, you can't. 
[01:09:00]  First of all, you can't have a dog bowl at halftime either because he can't put his fingers in the hole, jerk.  He can push that ball with his little snout.  You can't push that bowling ball.  You put a little kibble in one of the finger holes.  Let me tell you, baseball is too easy to do.  That's why.  It's too easy.  Okay, because they don't, think about what you said at halftime, right?  Basketball, hockey.  Yeah.  They don't have defense that the, they just have a guy trying to shoot in there. 
[01:09:30]  Right.  They just have a guy trying to hit the puck in.  They just have a guy.  So the defense is the big piece of plywood with the hole the size of the puck.  But it's just there.  Right.  But in baseball, they don't have like, they don't have a, it's too easy to hit.  That's why if they had a guy just kind of toss you a baseball, you can hit it.  I'm not talking toss you a baseball.  I'm talking any regular guy wins this contest.  He gets to stand at the plate against a real major league pitcher who's throwing a 95-mile-an-hour fastball at his cheek. 
[01:10:00]  And you think this guy's going to be able to hit a home run?  Might get lucky.  Might get lucky.  But the average guy will not.  He might get lucky.  No, he will not even get lucky.  There is no way.  Give me a thousand guys that will try it.  You think you can hit a three-point over Kevin Garnett if he's defending you as hard as he can?  No.  Even by luck?  And I consider myself a pretty good basketball player, not a chance.  You would have to do a gay hook shot, some type of running, throw it over his head and pray. 
[01:10:30]  You would have to try a metal arc lemon, whatever.  I'm thinking that would be easier than hitting a home run.  Absolutely not.  All you've got to do is close your eyes and swing.  A major league pitcher, 95 miles an hour.  Close your eyes and swing.  Just swing.  You could connect with that thing as hard as you can and still have it hit the pitcher's mouth.  There's not a guy in the studio that can hit a home run, even if they were in a major league park against a major league pitcher.  Even if they were pitching it in slow.  Even if they were pitching it, I think you had a better chance of getting a three-pointer over Kevin Garnett.  I think this whole argument's pretty ridiculous there. 
[01:11:00]  I don't understand it.  Why are we even arguing the point?  All right, we've got to take a break.  It's not a bad dog show.  We've got to take a break.  We've got to take a break.  We've got to take a break.  Dogs, I can't play the game.  We've got to take a break.  You're not going to be able to see a dog shoot in the basket.  We've got to take a break.  Got enough dumps.  Picking up Girls Made Easy, 1975 style.  This is perfect for Patrice O'Neal, so we'll do that next.  It's the ONA virus, and it's spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:11:30]  Freaking not taking the Eagles over the Cowboys.  What's wrong with you?  All right, buddy.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Sean Hannity was on hold there.  Want to wish us a happy two-year anniversary of being back on radio.  Yeah.  Ah, that didn't pan out that great earlier this week.  Gave us a sucky show. 
[01:12:00]  Who cares?  No more anniversary shows.  The anniversary shows, yeah.  Also, Dane Cook is calling in in about, I don't know, later on this morning, actually.  I think it's going to be on XM.  I'm going to ask him about his name being in the paper today.  In page six of the post, it talks about, you know, not actually page six, whatever page page six is on.  You would think they would put it on page six every day, but they want you to search it out.  Some canoodling.  He's being accused of canoodling, that word they like to use in the post. 
[01:12:30]  With Jessica Simpson at a party.  They're in a booth laughing and chit-chatting and whispering in each other's ears.  They want it to sound like that, but usually these clubs, you can't talk to each other.  You have to get right into somebody's ear.  These gossip asses, they have nothing else, so they're just trying to make something happen.  Yeah.  They're just good friends.  It's so obvious.  An employee of the month starts today, and they're hanging out.  Yeah, get a little press.  They're both in New York probably for, you know, to get all the press in,  and they're, of course, hanging out in clubs and restaurants, and they're going to hang out together. 
[01:13:00]  Canoodling, I thought, is when you're kissing.  You're in a booth somewhere, maybe, and you're nuzzling and kissing.  Not just talking.  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ, we're all canoodling right now.  Look at us talking.  I guess.  Whatever.  Where were we at?  Oh, I wanted to get to Patrice.  He has a few things that he needs to plug here.  Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, yeah.  Tonight and tomorrow, I'm at Stand Up New York in New York City. 
[01:13:30]  Boom.  I'm off my retirement, my New York retirement.  You're coming out of retirement.  That's on 78 and Broadway, if you want to come down there.  That's Stand Up New York on 78 and Broadway.  Also, I'm doing a show with the Bobby Kelly from tourgasm fame.  Salem State University in Salem, Massachusetts with the witches and the beehive.  And that is this Wednesday, whatever date that is.  So today is Friday.  Wednesday, this upcoming Wednesday is the show at Salem State University, October something 
[01:14:00]  or another.  Nice.  And the next day, I'm at the whole rest of the week, I'm at Stress Factory in New Brunswick,  New Jersey.  So that's the 12th, 13th, 14th.  Oh, so the 11th.  Wednesday, the 11th.  I'm at Salem State with Robert Kelly.  And the 12th, 13th, 14th.  How the hell are we going to remember all this?  Listen, tonight and tomorrow.  Stand Up New York here in New York City.  Right.  Gotcha.  I got that one.  The 11th of next week, I'm at Salem State University with Bobby Kelly.  All right.  Okay.  And then the next day, the 12th, the 13th, and the 14th, I'm at Vinnie Brand's Club, 
[01:14:30]  the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  He's got a great comedy club down there.  You are flying out of retirement.  That is a lot.  Hey, man.  What are you doing?  I just got my tax bill for like the quarter or something. 
[01:15:00]  I'm not talking like income tax, like we got to pay.  I'm talking my first property tax bill came in.  Boy, you got to love Nassau County.  High five figures.  It's in the five figures.  High five?  A lot of people pay.  It's in Nassau County.  All right.  Now I got a problem with Vinnie.  Ridiculous.  Joe in Jersey.  Joe.  Yeah.  I was at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick, and I want to call Patrice out.  He had his little flyer on the wall and mentioned State of the Union with Chris Rock. 
[01:15:30]  Stick with the brothers.  No mention of O&A at all on your flyer.  All right.  That's no big deal.  I thought it was Vinnie.  I thought it was the Stress Factory.  State of the Union.  What is that?  See, you don't even know what they're putting on your posters that they put up at these places.  Vinnie has my old headshot.  Yeah.  They got like...  Vinnie's club is like working in somewhere in the deep south in Jersey.  Vinnie has your first headshot and your first movie.  I don't...  Do you think I call him and say, make sure you put O&A on and make sure you shut up? 
[01:16:00]  Put the new one.  Print up the new one.  There's a back stock room that's got like the comics names and you just pull out a picture  and pop it up in the window.  We're on most of those posters, which is pretty cool.  I got to admit, when I walk by Caroline's and I see the lineup for the next like eight months,  those guys all mention O&A.  Matter of fact, Mr. Mid-Jersey, wherever you call from, go to Caroline's.  It's all from the O&A show.  Yeah, we know.  Brian in Florida.  What's up?  He's just trying to start trouble.  Brian.  Hey, O&A.  Good morning, guys.  Good morning.  Make it fast because we got to get to picking up Girls Made Easy. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah, I'm just talking about the piggy, Miss Piggy, Fatty, whatever.  Fatty, pig, fatty.  Fatty, pig, fatty.  Sponsored by H57.com.  Who do ya?  There's a girl down in Florida here that's well over five.  Over five bills.  And her problem is that she thinks she's going to have to buy the two seats on the plane,  get up there, and she's going to get beat by someone.  And I think the problem is, I know at least for her, is the fact of getting up there.  Does she understand this is over five grand she'll get then? 
[01:17:00]  And probably other stuff, too, by the way.  Yeah, this is like, who cares if she has to buy two seats on a flight up from Florida?  Let me tell you where the contest is at.  We met Crystal two weeks ago today in Cleveland, 430 pounds.  The current leader, $10 a pound, of course.  So she's in for $4,300.  Not one girl has come close since then.  Nope.  Two weeks.  I think we only have three weeks left in the contest.  Yeah, she's a listener.  She understands all that.  I'm trying to talk her into it.  At least I'm going to have her call the show. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, have her call the show.  Maybe one of our trucker friends could drive her up.  Put her in the back with his load.  Dude, I'll tell you what you're doing.  With his load of chicken feet.  Because that plane is going to stink.  Oh, slip a roofie in a milkshake and put her on a barge and float her up here.  Put her in a dog crate.  She's got to fly on cargo.  Oh my God, 500 pound woman.  All right, get her to call the show and let's see what happens. 
[01:18:00]  Her name is Cheryl, so you'll know when she's calling.  Cheryl.  Maybe we can throw a flight in or something just to get her up here to get this contest rolling.  Is she near West Palm Beach?  Yeah, she's a toll booth operator.  She is West Palm Beach.  She's a toll what operator?  Hold on a minute.  Maybe our friends down there at the station in West Palm Beach can help us out.  Norton's down there at the improv all weekend long.  We can set something up at the station.  Oh, that'd be handy.  They'll weigh her at the station for us.  That'll be fair as long as they get video and pictures.  That could be good enough for the contest, I'm thinking, right, Ant? 
[01:18:30]  Yeah.  She's a toll booth operator.  All right, hold on the line.  We're going to try to work something out.  Or a toll collector.  Okay.  Is she standing outside the booth?  What, did you throw the coins in her mouth?  She is the toll booth.  She is the toll booth.  Yeah, let's see if the gang at the buzz can help us out with this one because it looks  like we might have a new leader.  She's 500 pounds.  Can you do the top 10 country songs today with Patrice?  Yeah, that's another bit we love doing with Patrice.  We'll do that over at XM.  Yeah, if you enjoyed it, you heard it yesterday. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, when we...  I know.  And then I...  Good move.  Forget it.  I got so pissed at Iraq.  I'm like, why would you do that knowing Patrice is coming in today and we can do a new version  of that?  We could have done a new version of it.  We still will do a new version of that.  All right.  Picking up Girls Made Easy, 1975.  These were all the rage back in the day.  There were ads in the back of smut magazines that would have books and videos sometimes  in the later 70s, but usually books or tapes that you could get and they would tell you 
[01:19:30]  how to pick up women.  And you would get this, read through it and become just a stud.  And they were all just bull.  Just bad ideas?  Yeah.  Bad 70s ideas, I would gather.  Patrice?  You never had a problem picking up girls, right?  I've had problems picking up girls.  Why do you think I'm so angry at women?  Is that it?  If I had an easy time getting women in my lifetime, I'd be much happier. 
[01:20:00]  As a kid, I was like too shy and always kicking myself in the ass going, I should have talked  to her kind of a thing.  And then as I got older, you kind of forget about that and just kind of take a chance,  dive in.  But that's why you resent women a little bit later as you get older is because when you're  young, you have the energy to do what you think you're supposed to do.  But then when you turn a certain age, you go, wait a minute, I spent my entire young  life chasing this.  Like how many times do you actually have sex and you go, man, that was like, I'm talking 
[01:20:30]  about sports sex.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Working up a sweat and getting a good workout.  And you go, you know, I could have, now you think about doing other things just to keep  things from being messy.  You know, you get a new bed, a nice bed, you pay a thousand dollars for your bed, you know,  for your mattress.  And then it's like, man.  Get a nice high thread count sheets.  Yeah.  I don't want to, oh, I'm such a fag when it comes to a thousand thread counts or nothing  less.  You need it.  What am I sleeping on?  Is this 750 thread counts? 
[01:21:00]  You want me to sleep on gauze?  This is itching.  Who, there's nails in this.  It's like sleeping on wheat.  What is this?  Take it away.  Oh, baby.  Come on, let's have sex.  I put, I have a, uh, shredded wheat.  Shredded wheat.  I have my, uh, my swing in the garage, my, uh, sex swing.  Uh-huh.  Me and my girl.  Why in the garage though, man?  Because that's where we can, I can keep it because that's where I allow sweat at my house.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, come on.  I don't want to, my Yankee candle plug-in things. 
[01:21:30]  I don't want, I don't want them to do overtime because it's stinking up in here.  So we do a little garage action and raise it up a little bit, let the funk go out of  the garage.  You got that nail to the beams in your garage?  Oh, is that great?  That's a hell of a visual.  To the garage.  I forgot about your sex swing.  To the garage, honey.  I'll never forget the glass dildos.  It's still there with a trunk.  I got a trunk filled with love.  It's got a James Bond case that this thing opens up and he's got all kinds of devices. 
[01:22:00]  High blood pressure medicine, man.  It don't, it don't move like it used to.  No.  So I need help.  Patrice came in.  Whatever help.  I need troops.  Patrice came in, uh, for the new listeners with this briefcase and it opened up and,  uh, there was all sorts of glass sex toys, let's just say, just in case they dumped  out.  I don't know.  I remember you with that.  That's what I'm getting at.  And Patrice is getting all excited and he's showing each individual glass apparatus and  explaining what each one did.  And he thought we'd have the same excitement as him. 
[01:22:30]  And I just had to say, uh, Patrice, what is, what is wrong with you?  You got to understand that we, we didn't, we had, we wasn't, we haven't been in contact  for two years or however long you guys off the radio, we would see you come down to tough  crowd and stuff.  Yeah.  And then you're back on the radio and that, that's when Oat was, um, Oat was like vengeful  Sith Lord Opie where he's just was making, he was making sure everyone knew he was back.  So we'd come in and he left me, I was out there waiting with my glass dildos.  Right.  And, and I'm like, why are you out? 
[01:23:00]  You kept me out here for two hours as if I was plugging glass dildos.  Like I came to say hello and you treat me like the dildo man.  So I just was coming to show my friends some dildos, you know?  Yeah.  And Opie goes, he really just had a moment and really made me feel bad.  Cause he just goes, what happened to you?  Like almost really concerned.  And I really wanted to go, I don't, I really don't know.  I don't know.  Why do I have a suitcase full of glass dildos?  You're right.  I have a suitcase, but they are fun though. 
[01:23:30]  And they're clean.  You always use it.  Anyway, I, uh, so that was what, uh, the, the sex swing though.  That's just, that's just classic.  Yeah.  Those thousand three count sheets, man.  You can't be having sex on them.  See?  Want to hear how we were supposed to pick up girls back in 1975?  Yeah.  And y'all still pick them up the same way.  This is probably how you met your girl.  Hello.  Well, hello, dear.  No, like I said, after a while you just kind of get, I don't know.  My opening line.  My opening line, I was with Jim Norton down in Philly and I, uh, and I went up to my girlfriend. 
[01:24:00]  Well, now my girlfriend said, uh, do you know where we could get something good to eat around here?  Ugh.  That was my opening line.  That's the first thing I ever said to her.  Is that the first thing?  Yeah.  I said, this simple loser.  I got him.  After I, after I was just sending shots and everything else over to kind of like soften the beaches, man.  Oh.  That's why you.  Then I got brave enough to walk over.  That's why you two are such in love.  Because you, you would hate to go and have to meet another woman just like that.  Because you would get too much pride to go.  Hey, listen. 
[01:24:30]  How you doing, babe?  You ever hear Opie and Anthony?  Uh, yeah.  I'm Opie, ho.  I'm me.  That's your pickup line from now on, Greg.  I am O, ho.  You don't have to worry about it, man.  Pick him up.  I don't, I don't, I don't want her going out with this version of me.  With what version?  I want her going out with the other version of me.  What's the other version?  Greg Hughes?  Yeah, Greg Hughes.  Not Opie?  Oh, you get it.  The actor that plays.  I'm Greg Hughes, the actor that plays Opie on the Opie and Anthony show.  You're romantic. 
[01:25:00]  I don't want her to go out with this version.  You're kidding me?  That is such a horrendous version.  This version is awful.  She knows the real me.  Shut up.  This is the only you.  Listen, man.  I try to convince myself there's another version.  Will you go with it?  It's a worse version.  The Greg Hughes, Greg Hughes stinks.  Oh, damn.  You know, you're right.  Give me a break.  She's the one who deals with the real, that's because Greg Hughes is the one that needs somebody  to be around to go, you know what, wow. 
[01:25:30]  No one would be with Greg Hughes but me.  That's why he's, be Opie all the time.  If you can.  All right.  I'll give you an example of being Opie all the time.  Call my phone.  Just call my phone.  Before you, hold on.  I don't know if I got your number.  I'm going to be honest.  We don't talk to each other anymore.  Let's see.  I got my new phone and I haven't gotten everybody's number.  Okay.  There it is.  All right. 
[01:26:00]  Hold on.  Before you call it.  All right.  I'm almost ready.  Before you call it.  I'm ready.  This is me being Opie all the time.  I left work yesterday.  I forgot that I gave Danny my phone to get more ringtones in my phone.  Okay.  I'm online at the bank in a hoity-toity.  And this chick.  Stuffy environment.  Lying.  All people that just are miserable that think they're better than everybody else.  Upper West Side crap.  Right.  I'm online with these people yesterday.  And my phone rings.  Dial my phone. 
[01:26:30]  This is what the whole bank heard.  Okay.  Here we go.  This is the God's honest truth.  Is it ringing?  Not yet.  Mm-hmm.  I have kiddie porn on my computer.  I have kiddie porn on my computer.  I have kiddie porn on my computer.  I have kiddie porn on my computer.  I have kiddie porn on my computer.  Dude.  I dropped my phone trying to shut it off.  Shut it off.  I went into panic mode.  But you Opie.  Yeah.  They don't know that.  You just say, hey, baby, I'm Opie. 
[01:27:00]  They don't know that.  You ain't got more money in this bank.  I panicked.  Opie, you ain't got no money in that bank because you Greg Hughes?  I panicked, though.  I'm like, oh, my God.  Opie National Bank.  That's the bank you are at.  I'm kind of with you, right?  That's my new ringtone right there.  Why do you do this?  That's my new ringtone.  What is this, your alter ego?  This is you.  What?  Stop trying that.  It's all right.  You know what?  He's getting old.  He has a conscience now.  That's karma.  You believe in karma.  Karma.  You believe in karma. 
[01:27:30]  There you go.  That's what I want you to do at home.  Do a nice beavis.  Stop curling up like a kitten down at your girl's kneecaps.  That's how you pick up girls.  Hey, baby.  I always loved that.  So you think that's no big deal?  I'm at the bank, and that's blasted through my phone, and they don't have a sense of humor  like the people that listen to this show.  Because your job is to be above people like that.  Your job is to think stuff like that is funny.  That's why you're here.  That's why you said, listen to me. 
[01:28:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You said Farrah Fawcett has poopy cancer.  Well, yeah.  That's why I get the big boss right now.  So this is what you do in the bank.  And somebody goes, oh, it's terrible about Farrah Fawcett.  And you just go, yeah, she got that poopy cancer.  What do you want me to say?  Colon?  That's not funny?  Then you just compare deposit slips and shut her right up.  There you go.  Patrice, I'll tell you something. 
[01:28:30]  How many zeros I had to write, bitch?  I'll tell you something.  I do think I have big balls.  Patrice is the king, though.  I've been with Patrice.  You don't give a crap.  No.  No.  The stuff that comes out of his mouth when we're not in this studio.  It's easy to be an ass in this studio.  You are truly a free man.  You are so free with yourself when you're outside the studio.  You are able to just skip through life.  You don't care what anyone thinks.  It doesn't matter.  Now we've got to take a break, and we'll do Picking Up Girls Made Easy from 1975 after the break. 
[01:29:00]  Another break.  Nice tease, Opie.  It's flying by today.  I don't know what to tell you.  How many people sell stuff in this world?  What are you selling now?  Gum?  I also want to get to the students.  Keep them coming.  I want to get to the students that started the White People Club at Arizona State University.  Fantastic.  Y'all need a club.  How about the radio host that did the same thing at his own house?  They're ripping me off.  Movement to arm teachers with guns.  Oh, jeez.  And a magazine. 
[01:29:30]  I'm talking about knee-jerk asses.  And a magazine to publish a list of women who have had abortions.  We've got some good stuff still to do.  A public list of famous women?  I guess.  Well, it's not going to be Mary Jane Smith from freaking Yonkers.  As Gregory Hughes would say, abortions.  As Opie would say, who got the claw?  The hook.  Who got the hook?  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  Who shot that little string bean out?  That's Opie.  And we've got to give away one more MacBook today. 
[01:30:00]  See what we've got to do before we get out of here at night?  Very busy.  Very busy.  Maybe we go late today because we've got lots to do today.  Maybe we just do that.  You know, I'm not known enough to have everything I have go to charity.  I still need stuff.  Can I get some of this stuff?  Yeah, you need some stuff.  Can I have some stuff?  We could probably get you a plasma TV from Panasonic.  Dude.  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.  Let's try to hook Patrice up.  I mean, you know, that's what I'm talking about.  Very loyal to the show. 
[01:30:30]  Get Patrice.  Brings his A-game when he's here.  I got up at four in the morning.  Yeah.  I don't have a job.  And brings his A-game, so.  I got up with the milkman.  Oh, gee, there's our commercial.  Boy, they are playing us a lot.  A TV or that chick?  If you can get me that girl.  We could probably get you that chick.  Yeah, bring.  She has low self-esteem.  We could get her playing.  Jesus.  She was a wonderful girl.  O.B. and Anthony, they belong on the radio.  All right, it's the O.B. and Anthony virus spreading across America.  The commercial.  Ah, whatever. 
[01:31:00]  What's he talking about?  O.B. and Anthony, uncut and live, continuing the show on XM Satellite Radio starting at 9 a.m. Eastern.  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  Shout out to the news.  Oh, my God.  The show is even funnier during the break.  Oh, damn.  During the breaks, I should say.  Patrice O'Neill filling in for Jim Norton today.  He's down there at the Improv in West Palm Beach all weekend long.  Of course, this is the O.B. and Anthony show.  The O.B. and Anthony show. 
[01:31:30]  I went into the bathroom, came out with an idea, Anthony.  And that's how it works.  A $1,000 bounty for the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  Oh, no.  Look who's on Imus.  What happened?  Look who's on Imus behind it.  Oh, Mark Chernoff?  Yeah.  Mark.  God, that's going to be exciting radio.  Hi, Mark.  I hope Imus is just lambasting him.  Did somebody get a phone book to prop him up on the seat? 
[01:32:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Jerk.  Bounty.  Yeah, Bounty.  Bounty.  Because there's fat girls out there.  Of course there are.  I see them every day.  And there's guys out there that are looking at the fat girls going, man, she's fat.  She should be on the O.B. and Anthony show.  I listen.  And by the way, I don't know who brought this up.  Money.  But I'm doing it all the time as well.  You see these fat girls on the street, and you throw a money figure at them.  You're going, I'm thinking to myself, oh, that's $3,200.  That's what I do now.  Yeah, she's at.  Oh, that's $3,500. 
[01:32:30]  She's $2,500.  Eh, $2,500.  $2,500.  Eh.  Eh, she's freaking $900.  Give me a bag of shells.  She's $990 pounds.  Nothing.  $990.  What?  I was trying to work down my joke.  90 pounds would be a, wow.  Yeah, I failed.  Go broke.  All right, man.  Well, we got $1,000 bounty.  What do you think about this?  I like it because it gets, now the woman, the fat woman, doesn't even have to listen to the show now.  Now a guy or a girl that knows a fat woman can now bring her to the show knowing that they get a grand out of it. 
[01:33:00]  You bring a grand just, you get a grand for bringing a fat girl.  Just to bring the girl.  In any size fat girl.  Finders fee.  No, no.  Whoever brings in the winner of the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest gets $1,000.  $1,000.  On top of what the girl gets for $10 a pound.  So she's getting her $10 a pound.  And on top of that, whoever brings her in gets the $1,000. 
[01:33:30]  And that's something.  Yes, Patrice O'Neal?  Yes, Patrice O'Neal, yeah.  I'm thinking that if I knew a fat person.  Mm-hmm.  A fat girl rather.  You're a great big fat person.  You're a great big fat person.  Oh, God damn.  I love that dude.  Love that guy.  You have, okay, you should offer the bounty people, you should offer them a certain amount  of money anyway for bringing a certain amount of poundage.  So let's say you give $200 for somebody that brings in a girl at least 300 pounds, like 
[01:34:00]  just to have women come, you know, and like the $1,000 winner, but let's say if you bring  in a woman like $4.50, just for the trouble of bringing somebody $4.50, you should give  them a couple of hundred.  How about $0.50 a pound for the finder of fat girls that come up?  $0.50 a pound?  That's a lot, dude. 
[01:34:30]  No, that's not a lot.  Is that?  Yeah, I know it's not.  No, it is.  Oh, no.  But like if you bring up a 400-pound girl, then the finder gets like...  No, no, no.  We're getting too complicated.  $1,000 for the person that brings in the winner of the fatty pig fat.  How about we take a percentage of the number of the people that come in and then take...  $1,000 is not worth it to throw it out there?  No, it's not worth it to go find a fat bitch.  Like, it's like...  I'm not going to...  It's not about finding the fat bitch.  The fat bitches are out there, and we got listeners going, wow, she would win the contest. 
[01:35:00]  Now, his incentive is I could get $1,000 if I could talk her to come into the studio.  It's simple.  $1,000 bounty to the person that brings in the winner of the fatty pig fatty contest.  And right now, it has to be someone over 430?  430.  430.  Over 430.  Look at this.  We got Tugboat the Trucker.  Tugboat.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I got a cousin, man, that'll go six and a quarter easy.  And the problem is, is I can get her to New York, but, dude, I can't get her there except 
[01:35:30]  maybe on the weekend.  Now, your brother out there at F.H. Riley's got a scale that'll weigh this much, bitch?  We might have a scale, but we don't have enough food.  A little fat joke, because my brother runs a restaurant.  Let me ask you something, dude.  How come you guys don't treat your female fans better?  Are you kidding me?  I think we do.  Oh, come on, man.  Happy Typing Girl knocks herself to death for you guys behind the scenes, and I never hear 
[01:36:00]  you guys give her props.  She's busting her ass.  Because she refuses to get naked.  Are you insane, sir?  Am I insane?  Do you know that we were all laughing our asses off on Pal Talk last night for hours  on end?  That is the kind of thanks I give.  I go beyond this program and get on Pal Talk, and we were all laughing and laughing last night.  That's how I show my appreciation to the fans. 
[01:36:30]  I've seen you there in your palatial mansion and knocking all the crap out of us poor guys.  Now, what about getting this fat bitch to F.A. Riley's?  Does she have to eat when she gets there?  I can get her there probably the weekend after next.  Why are we making so many concessions for this?  Hold on a line.  No, you've got to get your ass down at the station.  Yeah, we could have some of these fat girls go to one of our affiliate radio stations, 
[01:37:00]  but it has to be in studio somewhere.  Talk to Tugboat.  By the way, we do love Happy Typing Girls.  She does a lot for the show.  Of course.  Break out a character for a second.  Hey, Patrice was talking about relationships and girlfriends during the break.  His analogy was amazing.  They're always hysterical, always unbelievable, yet completely true when it comes to Patrice.  You are in your own little world as far as the world of romance goes, the world of love, the world of mating. 
[01:37:30]  It's the world of animals.  Yeah.  Just be an animal.  And all you have to do is, as an animal, what we do other than dolphins is we communicate,  and you just communicate what you feel.  My girlfriend's gaining a little weight.  She said, will you leave me?  I said, yes, because I found you not fat.  And if you get fat, see, getting a girl who's already fat is different from watching your girl become fat. 
[01:38:00]  It's like buying an old car is vintage.  Watching your car get old, get rid of that piece of mess.  It's got miles on it, unless somebody else call it vintage.  Dude, you're getting rid of this vintage 94?  Yeah.  Now, you're giving it to somebody who wants that.  Who wants that vintage.  But I had my girl new off the shelf.  She keep it polished.  New girl smell.  New girl smell.  Everything, right.  I don't want to watch her become what somebody else is already.  I didn't buy this car with a dented bumper. 
[01:38:30]  That's right.  When I got it, it was a perfect bumper.  That's Patrice.  So as he's saying this, I'm just laughing because he is the most like, I've never heard any guy actually speak like this.  Do your sneaker analogy.  That brings it home.  It's pretty much the same thing.  I know it's the same thing, but it's vintage.  It's not vintage if you watch it become old.  If you have it when it's from new to old, that is just a raggedy piece of garbage. 
[01:39:00]  But if I see something, you know what?  Give the vintage to the Chinese people that want your old nights.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  So my girl is saying to me, I'm like, I'm not mature enough because I am with you because you're a hot girl.  If you become not hot, you become a fat girl, then I can go get a fat girl who functions being a fat girl. 
[01:39:30]  She's vintage.  So when your sneakers get old, you throw them away and you get a brand new pair of sneakers.  Or what we do in the hood is you hang them over to a telephone wire.  Yeah, what's wrong about that?  That's what I do to my girl if she gets too fat.  There's a bunch of girls just hung over telephone wires in the hood.  Oh, and tied them together.  So Patrice leaves and ties them together by the legs.  Throws them up there.  They swing around a few times.  I'm not here to be mature like that.  She serves a purpose.  I love her, but she serves a purpose, man.  Fat girls, some fat girls like being fat. 
[01:40:00]  They move well fat.  They know how to look good fat.  She's a good looking girl.  And those are for the guys that want the vintage.  That want vintage.  Now, my girl, a fat version of my girl, she will walk out on the streets and somebody will pick her up in a second.  But they don't realize she's vintage to them.  That they like that.  She's just an old fat bitch to me.  So you just told your broad if she gains weight, she's out.  Oh, man.  I didn't tell her if she gains weight.  She's gaining weight.  And she asked me, she's getting nervous. 
[01:40:30]  And I said, you should be absolutely nervous.  Wow.  You've got balls.  That is the.  There's so many guys listening right now going, I wish I had the balls to say that.  You should be nervous.  And she knows it.  All right.  Well, picking up girls.  Made easy.  1975.  If we don't play some of this audio tape, we're going to really piss off some people.  Maybe Patrice ought to take some of this to heart.  Right.  Here we go.  So this was an educational film that came out in 1975.  I think they were just tapes, audio tapes and books that you used to be able to buy to give you a better edge when you go out there to pick up women. 
[01:41:00]  And they were just really full of crap.  This is from 1975.  The street pick up.  Is this pre-AIDS?  Learn how to do the hustle.  Oh, yeah, it is.  Yeah.  Everything has to be PA.  Is it PA or BA?  It's PA or?  It's pre-AIDS, man.  It's pre, yeah.  It has to be pre-AIDS.  It's books like this that made AIDS.  Here's the intro.  How big it is.  Here's the intro to the street pick up.  There are a few basic principles that you have to master before you can move on to wild, uninhibited street play. 
[01:41:30]  First, it's important to remember not to get greedy.  Pick a girl whose outfit and style you really like so when you make your move, she'll instinctively know you're sincere and mean it.  Remember, girls like guys who know what they want, and a girl likes to think you think she's something special.  There's a second general rule for street pickups, and that's having a relaxed approach. 
[01:42:00]  You've got to keep cool and act casual.  Not so casual that the girl doesn't think you're interested, but offhand enough so you don't alarm her.  Alarm her?  You're going to scare her.  First of all, this guy sounds like he knows nothing.  Yeah, absolutely nothing.  His voice is cracking.  His voice is cracking.  He's a dullard.  He's a nerd.  A nerd.  But there is a natural – we have to just dig with nature.  There's a natural point to what he's saying, basically. 
[01:42:30]  It has to be a ground between confident and humble.  You have to figure out a way, and that's what men haven't done.  There has to be a proper, you know what, I could get you, and a proper, you know what, but I want you.  But I know I could get you.  So it can't be too much, I'm better than you, and it can't be too much, hey, can I possibly take you for some coffee because you're gorgeous?  It has to be a middle ground.  Like, look, man, let's be honest here.  I could get you. 
[01:43:00]  Yeah.  And your life ain't going nowhere.  And you've got to emote that.  You've got to emote that.  You've got to put that out.  Well, good old Mike hits the street, and he does some acting as he looks at girls.  Picking up girls meeting in 1975.  In 1975.  I think we have that right here.  All right.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  The bone.  Dig it.  Is that your little brother?  He's a good-looking kid. 
[01:43:30]  Always compliment their honor beverages.  This is great iced tea.  Here we go.  Let's watch Mike in action in downtown Dallas when he was in town on business, and it looked to him like every secretary in town was taking her Texas-sized s*** for a lunch hour exercise walk.  Yeah, dig it.  Texas-sized cans.  Oh, brother. 
[01:44:00]  Look at those knockers.  Yeah, I don't think that works.  No.  Well.  Did he say it right to her?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's supposed to be Mike on the street looking at girls.  I guess that's not how to do it.  No.  Look at those knockers.  Jesus.  And those.  Look at the points on those.  No bra on that chick.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  There's another one.  She's got a parrot.  Jesus. 
[01:44:30]  Well, these Texas chicks are too much.  Phew.  Whoops.  Mike's forgotten rule number one, and he's just spinning his wheels.  Don't forget, you've got to make a difference.  Make a decisive choice.  After all, you're not girl-watching.  Mike's like the donkey who's starving because it can't choose between two bales of Texas hay.  It's only an ass that can't make hay in Dallas, Mike.  Ha-ha.  Oh, my God.  Does this stink.  Wow, this guy is awful.  This stinks.  With that monotone, no personality voice. 
[01:45:00]  But has it changed?  No.  Has it changed?  No.  Does everyone know?  Every guy knows you can't just go up to a girl and say, nice, knocker.  This isn't anything new.  No, he's, no, that guy didn't.  This, the first.  He's just looking.  Yeah, the, this, the, the, the, the Mike guy is going, that's not what you do there,  buddy.  Yeah.  It's like this guy is to himself going, oh, I want, I want those knockers.  Ooh, I want those.  He's going, hey, stupid.  Yeah.  You don't just want.  You can get.  You can get. 
[01:45:30]  With my, you keep listening, you're going to be able to walk up to one of these Texas  beauties and make a move.  All right.  And it's going to work.  Real fast, Crystal, Boston, what's up?  Hey, I have a woman who's like 470.  Yeah.  And I wanted to know how much exactly I would get to bring her into your studio since I  live in Boston.  Finder's fee, $1,000 to the, to the person that brings in the winner of the Fatty Pig's  Fatty Contest.  If she wins, yeah.  If she wins.  So you're taking that chance that someone might beat 470 pounds. 
[01:46:00]  But that's pretty big.  But that's pretty big.  Crystal's been the leader for two weeks at 430 pounds, and we haven't had any other girls  come close.  And when's the contest then?  Right around Halloween.  On Halloween?  Yeah, right about there.  All right.  I'll be seeing you guys.  All right, cool.  Hold on a line.  All right.  See if she's serious.  Let's get to the next clip here.  Picking up Girls Made Easy, 1975.  More acting.  Excuse me, but I wonder if you tell me where you get your hair done. 
[01:46:30]  What?  Your hair.  It's perfect.  I'd like to know where you get it done.  It's, uh...  Why?  It's beautiful and just perfect for the job.  Perfect for what job?  A second ago, this groovy chick was just a girl in his dreams.  Now Mike's managed to intrigue and flatter her.  And scare her.  The most lovely and least complimented, because her breasts usually get all the attention,  feature, her hair.  But Mike plays it very cool and keeps spinning his web.  Uh, let me explain. 
[01:47:00]  Web.  I'm an advertising executive, and we're down here in Dallas looking for girls with hair  as pretty as yours to use in our, uh, shampoo commercials on television.  Else to mention that he's got a wife back in, uh, Idaho.  This is worse than, could you help me put this couch in the van?  What?  Okay.  That guy was...  That was Opie Hughes.  That was Opie.  Oh, that was...  He was using his Opie-ness.  His Opie-ness.  To get him...  That wasn't Greg Hughes.  He wasn't Greg Hughes.  The actor that plays Opie. 
[01:47:30]  He was Opie-ing it.  That was being Opie because he was lying.  Because he was saying I'm Greg Hughes.  He's not an ad exec.  He's spinning a web.  No, he was saying he's really an ad exec.  But he was...  He's using what he knows best, which is his career.  How did we know?  Did he mention that he was an ad exec?  He's not gonna...  I think he's lying.  No, I don't...  You can't lie to the broads.  That might become your girlfriend.  Dude, this isn't looking for a girlfriend.  What is this?  He's looking to bang a chick in Texas.  So why don't they say that?  Is this bedding down? 
[01:48:00]  Is this bedding down?  Be groovy.  A hip cat.  This is 75.  What's wrong with you?  You're a square, man.  So he's just trying to get some pooh-bop.  He's trying to get some action.  All right.  That's why he's...  But the way he complimented her hair out of nowhere...  This is in 75 when a condom was just...  He was uncircumcised.  Oh, please. 
[01:48:30]  He's just...  He's just looking for action.  ...to use in our shampoo commercial for television.  Really?  Yeah.  And this Texas sun is murder on most hair I've seen today, but yours is lovely.  Just lovely.  Wow.  You're a creep.  Thank you.  Now Mike's set her up.  All girls want to be on television, so Mike puts a real casual front on.  All right.  He's trying to just get some pooh-bop. 
[01:49:00]  Yeah, he's lying to her.  But he's so creepy.  Yeah, that hair.  That'd look great on your head on my mantle.  But that's what...  Here's what...  Women just want an excuse to be a hoe.  It's like, as long as it's not their fault that they went home with this guy or went to  the hotel with this guy, as long as they make her feel like...  Like he had the line and...  Yeah.  Like, it's not like, hey, look, I ain't...  Look, I don't care about your hair because I'm trying to mess it up, really.  You know what I mean?  So it's like, look, why don't you come on back and do this?  She can't go, okay, you have to make him feel like it's something else. 
[01:49:30]  Yeah.  That's not that bad.  It's just that now women are a lot more savvy.  Yeah, a woman would pick up on this in a second.  You would be blown off, probably arrested.  30 years later.  A woman who was born during this is 30 years old now.  Different time, different savviness.  You know, it's a different thing than that.  But that's exactly the same level.  Well, let's see how this ends.  Mike plays it cool in this next clip. 
[01:50:00]  I think this approach stinks.  He gives her just enough slack and then confesses that he's just an insurance salesman.  Are you kidding?  He fesses?  Let's see what happens.  Nice hair and toots.  Well, I don't want to hold you up.  I'm sure you're very busy.  Why don't you just tell me the name of your beauty parlor and I can go by there and see  if I can find someone there who's got some spare time.  Oh.  I got some spare time.  Are you sure?  Why, yes, I'm certain.  Oh, this is a real imposition.  You were going to lunch.  Now Mike is careful not to get too casual and lose her. 
[01:50:30]  He gives her just enough slack and sets the hook.  No, I was just going shopping for a few things.  It can wait.  You know, I'd never be able to find such perfect hair for us in any beauty parlor anyway.  But I wash and set it myself.  You do?  Yes.  Well, can you spare a minute from your shopping?  Yes.  Then why don't you give me all the details?  Let's duck in here for a drink for a minute. 
[01:51:00]  Mike has completely disarmed her natural street defenses by complimenting her and then backing  off, pretending he's not so interested.  Not so interested.  Now that they're having a drink, let's see how he handles telling this luscious chick he's  really an insurance salesman without losing her.  You know, I've got something I should confess to you.  Why is he confessing?  I'm a bus driver.  Why is he confessing if he's just going for the puha?  I don't know.  It can't be a relationship thing he's going for. 
[01:51:30]  The whole thing is based on a lot.  The first thing that he told her was a lie.  What's that?  Well, I really noticed your hair for personal reasons.  Yeah.  Oh.  You see, I'm just visiting Dallas on business.  And when I saw you, I thought to myself, now she belongs in a television commercial.  She's so great looking.  If I were in advertising, I would have picked you from all the girls in Dallas to be in my  shampoo commercial. 
[01:52:00]  Really?  That's the truth.  Now Mike's told her the truth.  He didn't tell her the truth.  And he's still pretending he doesn't even notice the snowy cleavage she's showing him.  The snowy cleavage.  And you know she looks like one of the women standing around when Kennedy got shot?  Of course.  Big hair.  Big beehive hair.  And she probably has a blue suit.  A Jackie O suit.  Like the chick from Animal House.  Like she looks just like that.  Yeah.  It's Dean Wormer's wife. 
[01:52:30]  And he's, oh really?  You still want to see my cucumber?  And are they going to, later on are they going to show the part where she throws some kind  of hot soup in his face for wasting her time?  By this time, the roofie he put in her drink should be taking effect.  This thing is pre-stalking laws.  No.  Oh yeah.  Pre-age.  This thing is pre-everything.  Pre-restraining orders.  Pre-restraining.  Pre-everything.  Right.  This is where you can just go.  This is pretty much just after the point where hitting him on the head with a club and dragging 
[01:53:00]  him home was acceptable.  That they said no to.  But everything else was a go.  This is the wild, wild west of picking up broads.  You want to see how it ends there?  Of course.  Of course you do.  How does this liar get the action?  Mike gets a day for later tonight.  He should go all the way tonight.  Say, since I don't know a thing about Dallas, maybe you could suggest a club where they  have dinner and dancing.  Well, there's a pot of luck or there's Sir Williams Inn.  Send it to a gay bar and don't show up. 
[01:53:30]  Sir Williams.  How'd you like to go there with me tonight?  I was supposed to go to the movies.  Oh, that's too bad.  This is my only night in town.  I was really hoping to step out and enjoy some real Texas hospitality.  Mike lets her know it's tonight or never.  I could go to the movies another night.  And tonight you can show me Sir Williams.  Terrific!  I'll meet you afterward.  All that innuendo.  And I'll show you my Prince Albert.  Listen. 
[01:54:00]  Let's go somewhere and have some crispy balls.  Some delicious...  What an ass!  He really is an ass.  Oh.  Well.  Look at that fireman's helmet.  It is bulbous.  I wonder if there's a raging fire somewhere.  This gets her mind thinking about other things.  Oh, my God.  What?  I've never heard so much innuendo.  I know.  It's the worst. 
[01:54:30]  Some of this Texas hospitality.  Hospitality.  Do they serve bratwurst here somewhere?  Big fat bratwurst?  They should have had a bubble over his head that said wink wink or a thought bubble.  I'm going to get some ass later.  Could you help me in this supermarket?  I need to know if these cantaloupes are fresh.  So I'm just going to stand here and squeeze them.  Oh, yeah.  Do these look good?  Oh, pickles are my favorite.  Could you just roll these kiwis around in your hand for a while and tell me if they're fresh? 
[01:55:00]  That's good.  No, the only way you can really tell is if I lob a spoonful of yogurt in your face.  So since we're at the supermarket and you're fondling the kiwis, I'm just going to throw yogurt at your face while I see if these cantaloupes are fresh.  I know it might look odd, but could you lay that trout under my nose?  Because I really, I'm shopping here with you in Texas.  Oh, God.  In your window is hilarious. 
[01:55:30]  It's unbelievable.  That's out-uendo.  That isn't even close to innuendo.  That is the most, there is no girl that would go for this in the past 50 years.  Well, let's see how it ends, okay?  And tonight you can show me Sir Williams.  Terrific!  I'll meet you afterward.  Okay.  That's it.  From sidewalk to evening date.  Mike played it beautifully once he settled down and chose his girl.  Because he picked a chick he really dug, his natural sincerity showed, and she instinctively trusted him. 
[01:56:00]  He was able to keep cool and let her get excited.  Yeah.  With his style, he should go all the way tonight.  He should.  Okay.  I got something.  Well, I want to see how much times have changed.  We got the walkover, right?  Yeah.  One of these guys are doing that exact thing to a girl on the street during the walkover.  Get kicked in the...  I want to see how far he gets.  Do the same thing.  Oh, excuse me.  Who does your hair?  Run through it a couple...  Whoever's going to do it, listen to that a couple of times. 
[01:56:30]  Get the basic gist.  I want to see how far you get on the walkover.  Because I think it's going to be...  First of all, every girl is going to pass by and not even stop.  If one stops, it's going to be what?  And you're never going to get past the I'm in commercial part of the...  It just wouldn't work.  None of these guys are going to do it.  It's hard to meet anybody in the street ever.  I don't know how many women I've ever met in the street.  In the street.  No one meets in the street.  Very difficult. 
[01:57:00]  All right.  Hold that thought.  We got a break.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Don't forget, Patrice O'Neill at Stand Up New York all this weekend or just tonight?  Yeah, tonight and tomorrow.  Tonight and tomorrow night in New York City, 78th and Broadway.  Very...  I mean, his comedy is just off the hook, yo.  Yo.  Patrice O'Neill is killing for us today.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Yo, check it out, the Opie and Anthony Show.  Time for a speed round.  We got to get out of here in about 15, 20 minutes. 
[01:57:30]  Then we'll continue on XM Satellite Radio.  We're doing the talent show now on the walkover, basically.  Yeah.  I don't know if it's called the talent show.  We just know a lot of people are trying to get our attention out there.  And they try emails that don't work anymore, or they give, like, business cards to people  that have worked for the show.  And we never hear about it.  Here's your opportunity.  During the walkover between this studio and the XM studio, you know, get our attention with 
[01:58:00]  something.  What did we get yesterday?  A guy that does his own homemade porn?  Yeah, that's what he did.  He gave us...  Teen porn or something?  He gave us some porn.  Today we're doing, what, a little...  What are we doing today, Ziggy?  What is that thing?  Ziggy from MyRadioStore.com is in studio.  By the way, my brother's brand new t-shirts are up on MyRadioStore.com.  Yeah, the Halloween shirt is really good and a couple other ones that he designed.  But you got little bikes.  Yes.  Actually, these we found at the PNC Bank Art Center show. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah.  One of our friends brought one over, and we just had a blast.  We just parked it right by the van, and people just couldn't get enough of them.  We just kept throwing out WoW stickers for people to ride them, and they're falling  all over the place.  So what, we're going to have people ride these to XM today?  We'll see if it's possible.  And we were hoping to get, like, Big A and Pat from Minaki.  Yeah.  We needed two really big guys on those things.  The bigger they are, the dumber it looks.  Absolutely.  All right, well...  You can ride that?  Yes, sir.  Let's see.  Oh, my God. 
[01:59:00]  That looks ridiculous.  We're going to do that all the way to XM today.  But, if you're trying to get our attention during the walk, you just get our attention  and tell us what you got, whether it's some kind of talent or something you want to promote.  And if it's really interesting enough, then we'll invite you up to XM to hang out with  us, okay?  Oh, you get to win a Helix today.  A Helix?  If you're first.  Courtesy of MyRadioStore.com.  Tom's going to be running in here any second to get freaking money from you.  I paid my bills.  You're advertising now?  Yeah. 
[01:59:30]  Ooh.  Damn, look at you.  All right, Ziggy, thank you.  Thank you, guys.  How's the van?  Oh, it's still fucked.  Potty mouth.  It's still aftime.  That's great.  How's the van?  I'm over here.  That's really good.  Obviously.  Jesus.  Are you going to let my brother off the hook?  Yeah, he's good.  He's all right.  He's good to go?  He's good to go.  Yeah, go to Brother Elmo on MySpace to check out.  Does he have pictures up of his wisdom teeth thing? 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  He was sending me pictures all day yesterday.  My brother, he's like, how old is my brother?  Like, 58 years old or something?  And he got four wisdom teeth pulled.  Don't worry.  I'm sure there'll be a t-shirt, like, next month with his teeth on it or something.  And he's just taking pictures of his bloody, swollen mouth and sending them to me.  And I'm assuming he would throw those same pictures up on his MySpace account.  Has he?  Has anyone checked it out?  All right, whatever.  All right, Zig, thanks.  We'll see you on the walkover.  See you.  Speed Round Imus had a couple things to say about us again today. 
[02:00:30]  And we share, like, program directors.  Mark Turnoff also works for The Fan here in New York.  What a fan?  And I guess he was on with Imus, and Imus had this to say today.  And now our leader, operations manager of FAN in New York, and Free FM, we're O&A.  I have my Opie and Anthony t-shirt on today, by the way.  It's not Wednesday, but...  Yeah.  What happens, like, when Deirdre sees the shirt?  Well, she wants one, too.  What do you mean, what happens? 
[02:01:00]  Well, I thought, you know, does she get the message, the wow message?  Yes, she does.  Oh, okay.  No, I had to explain it to her.  Okay.  Idiot.  He did call him an idiot.  I had to explain it to her.  Idiot.  Jerk.  Mark just thinks he does good radio.  He's way better behind the scenes.  Yeah.  For some reason, he insists on going on Mike with Imus.  He's awful.  Yeah.  What's Imus doing wearing our t-shirts every day?  It's creepy.  No, it's cool. 
[02:01:30]  It's creepy.  I-Man rules.  It's downright creepy.  There's golden locks coming out from under that hat.  He has a Whip-Em-Out Wednesday shirt on.  On MSNBC right now as he does his radio show.  Good for him.  But he's not brave enough to show the whole thing.  He always has a jacket over it or something.  Brave enough the man dresses cool.  He's a coward.  He's a cowboy.  He's a coward.  All right.  We got to give away a MacBook today.  You're going to make your adoptive daddy mad. 
[02:02:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  The final MacBook, Anthony.  This has just been an exciting contest.  It certainly has.  It was just unbelievable.  New stars have come out of this.  Maybe one.  It's amazing.  Maybe one.  Maybe two.  Now, there's been a couple.  I liked yesterday's.  I thought yesterday's was pretty good.  Oh, Jim on Dateline, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, that was pretty good.  It was Jimmy Norton clips thrown in with the guy from Dateline, making it sound like Jimmy 
[02:02:30]  was one of the guys that walked into the house looking for snacks with a youngster.  Well, we had five MacBooks to give away.  Thanks, Apple.  And all you had to do was throw together a 30-second production piece about the O.P.  and Anthony show.  Yeah, easy.  I like Monday's winner.  Can we play that again?  Monday's was good.  Yeah.  This is Adam R.  Started strong.  Huzzah!  I got to cast a spell on you.  I'll run ye through.  Four damage.  You're not even double dual wielding.  Plastic sword. 
[02:03:00]  Two damage.  Two damage.  I cast a spell.  Damn, am I being bagged?  I just cast a spell.  You've slowed me.  Now I cannot hit you as quickly.  Four damage.  Four damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Ooh, my arm.  I wish you were dead.  Do ye?  Over here, Anthony!  It took all the clips over a few weeks, I guess, that we were talking about my gaming  playing EverQuest and stuff, and LARPing, which I don't do. 
[02:03:30]  I hate LARPers.  We were goofing on LARPing.  LARPers.  Which is live action role playing, where people actually dress up as these characters you would  play in an online game like EverQuest or something, and hit each other with these fake  swords they make, and do things like that.  Two damage.  Two damage.  And he threw in some sound effects, some great music, and really made it sound like we were  battling Opie.  Deserving of a MacBook.  Absolutely.  That was Adam R.  You liked yesterday's? 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, yesterday's I thought was good.  It was Jim on Dateline.  This is from Matt M.  Predators scowling the internet.  Up next, you may be surprised who exactly does come calling.  What do you do for a living, Jim?  You know, look, I'm a comedian.  I'm working at the cellar.  So you're going to do what exactly with 13-year-old Jessie?  See, what I do is I read in the bottom, then you just gently rub, and then when she's  relaxing, you smack her again.  You get into very graphic detail about what you want to do to me.  I'll smell armpits.  I'll lick armpits.  And you won't believe what else he admits. 
[02:04:30]  I have a virus.  Finally, the virus is spreading.  Yeah, I like that one.  Definitely.  It's topical.  Pat the Trucker from Nebraska.  Oh, boy.  I don't know what you're getting at.  Hey, a-holes, how about doing a show without a third mic?  That is If You Can, which I doubt.  I have yet to hear a show without a third mic.  What the F?  I thought you were such great broadcasters.  Anthony and I did the show by ourselves.  Never. 
[02:05:00]  For...  Tell him we never did.  Just let him think.  Five, probably five years.  Trust me, Pat, we can.  Just let him think.  The show has developed to this point.  It makes it more fun for us.  This is what we have decided to do, to have a third mic.  And when Jimmy's not here, we bring in other friends of ours to help us out.  It makes it much more exciting because, you know what?  This job is just like every job.  After a while, it's the same crap day in and day out. 
[02:05:30]  Did I answer your question, Pat?  I don't think you turned around.  Look up our history, and you'll realize we did the Opie and Anthony show for many years,  just Ant and I and a guest here and there.  And we were very, very successful.  Pat.  But we decided this is the way we wanted the show to evolve.  And, Pat, if you don't like it, then find another show you might like better.  Thank you, Pat.  Pat the trucker.  Today's winner, Anthony.  Jackknife. 
[02:06:00]  Jackknife.  Jackknife.  That's the word of the day for you, Pat.  Pat, I want to see the last thing I want you to see is the back end of your trailer right next to you in your side window  before you roll over, and I hope you're hauling fuel.  And if these guys weren't so busy, I would love to just fill the studio with five or six guys.  It's a hang.  It's a lot more fun.  Do you want to just hang out with the same person every single day,  or do you try to, like, mix it up a little bit and get some friends in the mix? 
[02:06:30]  That's what we do, and that's why we're successful.  That's what we do now.  We figured out the formula of radio, you ass.  Right.  And if you don't like it, then find a show you like better.  Needed one part comedian to two parts radio hosts.  That's the formula.  Here's today's winner for the MacBook, Anthony.  It's Rocky M.  All right.  There's a man who leads a life of danger. 
[02:07:00]  Everyone he meets, he stays a stranger.  Every move he makes, another chance he takes.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow.  What?  What?  Yeah. 
[02:07:30]  What was from the show, the booing?  Was Danny drunk again?  Can you please tell me?  I don't care if it's true or not.  Just please tell me that you're picking some that didn't win also to show us how good the  ones we picked are.  And that was one of them.  You could lie to me.  Just say that's what it is. 
[02:08:00]  Please.  Please, Jesus.  Well, congratulations to Rocky M.  You just won the unbelievable new MacBook.  It has everything you need to explore all your creative possibilities and you can take it with you wherever you go.  Now you can create your own music, movies, and pile of ass.  Holy Jesus.  It's so much easier than using a PC.  Head to the Apple Store or Apple.com to check it out.  Danny.  You did a good health, you piece of garbage.  You undeserving idiot. 
[02:08:30]  You lucky bastard.  He's going around going, whoa, I won.  I won.  Is someone going to go there and teach him how to turn it on?  Danny, why did you pick that one?  Danny?  Oh my God.  I think they picked one out of the hat.  They got lazy.  Yeah.  There are certain rules that you need to adhere to for this contest.  And no one else did.  No, because there was a winner that wasn't this one, but because of certain stipulations, that person.  You couldn't find one that wasn't incoherently unfunny.  Was the stipulation somebody related to show or something like that? 
[02:09:00]  Or was it time constraint?  It was a residency issue.  You had to be in the country to actually win this.  Really?  Someone sent something from where?  What?  Where are these dumb rules?  It's coming from Mark.  No, I think in order to export computer equipment, you really can't export it to another country.  It's not allowed.  Make him pick it up himself.  Come here from where?  Where did he live? 
[02:09:30]  Arab, Arab, Thailand.  Wait, where is this?  Canada?  That's not another country.  That's like America North.  Yeah, that's like an extra state.  Yeah.  That's the state of Canada.  That's the 51st state that we don't know about.  That's the great white, ugh.  We speak the same language for the most part.  Where's that winner?  For the parts we don't like.  Everyone is saying that sucked.  And now they're all bitching because now everyone is saying theirs was better.  We made it four out of five days without one complaint because people were like, all right,  that's a good one.  Now we're going to get all of these, oh, mine didn't get picked. 
[02:10:00]  Blah, blah, blah.  Do we have the one that you wanted to pick but he was from out of country?  I can dig it up.  Let's hear it.  Dig it up for Monday because now we're running out of show.  Oh, my God.  Because I got to say, that one stunk.  Anti-climatic to the macro contest.  I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wait, that guy won something, right?  What?  You're waiting for the joke, right?  What?  Well, all judges' decisions are final, so that guy wins regardless.  And I agree with the people. 
[02:10:30]  Yes, it sucked.  What the F?  Mine was so much better than that.  We're getting those now.  But why was that second?  No, it was one winner a day.  So that was today's winner.  But there was no other option.  I'll be honest.  There were only two that I liked.  We had five winners.  I only liked two of them.  I thought they were all good.  I liked two a lot.  What was that?  But there wasn't any one that was picked over the four days that was like, oh, my God, 
[02:11:00]  that guy is not deserving.  What did this one have to do with the show, though?  Well, the booing?  It was Kenny Singing, which is.  Like, funny.  Oh, okay.  It was Kenny.  And it was booing.  I guess the booing, because what happened at the virus shows.  Like, nothing made sense in that.  He just kind of threw together a couple of things.  Like, nothing made sense if you don't listen every second.  Yeah.  The other ones, I understood.  Yeah.  Kind of funny.  Danny, I'm always with you.  I'm always with you.  Wow.  With your dry hair and your pubic beard. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, that just sucked.  That's too bad.  And, man, the listeners had a lot of time to get their stuff in this time.  We got a lot.  What country was this winner from?  Cleveland?  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neill, you killed for us.  Thank you.  Stand up, New York, tonight and tomorrow night here in New York City, 78th and Broadway.  Salem.  I think I'm in town this week and weekend, and I think I'm going to try to check you out  on, maybe tonight, actually.  We'll do that.  Salem State, Wednesday, the 11th, and the Stress Factory on the 12th, 13th, 14th of 
[02:12:00]  October this month.  That's next weekend, I guess.  Next weekend, yes.  All right.  Very good.  Thank you.  And I'll also see a bunch of you at FH Riley's, my brother's restaurant, 400 New York Avenue  in Huntington on Long Island.  I think I'll be hanging out there this weekend as well.  And at my show.  Whoa.  I'm going to be all old.  Dude.  Opie's everywhere.  Hello, bro.  I got a few days.  I'm going to do a show ass.  He won't be there.  I got a...  No, he's not going to be in town of New York.  I got a few days, and I'm filling it up with activities. 
[02:12:30]  I want to be there.  What are you doing, Anthony?  Oh, Anthony's going to play video games.  Dude, I'm around.  I'm playing.  I'll be there, and then I'll go back to my games.  All right.  Listen, today's football picks were sponsored by Dish Network.  More football for you.  Better TV for all.  Call 1-888-GET-DISH.  Thanks for picking my games this week.  Patrice.  What happened for you, baby?  $10,000 up for grabs.  If I win, I throw the money out of a helicopter.  We'll see how I did on Monday.  All right.  If you're not joining us over at XM, have a great day. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  I can walk on my hands.  I can fart and chew gum.  I play the over.  I can ride a unicycle.  I wear a bra and laced panties.  So your talent is being queer, Travis?  It's the O.P. and Anthony Walkover Talent Show.  If you have a unique skill, talent, music group, or physical affliction, we want to exploit. 
[02:13:30]  You can email steve at foundrymusic.com with your ideas, or you can just show up during the walk to XM and start shucking and jiving.  Shucking and jiving?  Jesus, Danny.  I don't write this shit.  The O.P. and Anthony XM Walkover begins now.  Oh, my God.  This sucks today.  And the temperature is not warm. 
[02:14:00]  See, this is kind of the evolution of this whole walkover thing, because it started in April.  And it was spring, so it wasn't bad.  Right.  Now we're going into fall, and...  Excuse me, who did your hair?  It's cold.  Excuse me.  What happened?  Who did your hair?  Oh, Patrice is giving some of the lines a try.  Oh, yeah, he's trying it out.  All right.  You know what's funny?  It's easy to talk about walking through the winter when it's 85 degrees out in New York. 
[02:14:30]  See, I know.  But as soon as it drops down to this, what is it, like 48 degrees in New York today?  50 degrees?  I don't know.  Tops with the wind making it feel a lot colder?  It's very windy, baby.  This is like...  Now I'm thinking no effing way, man.  No.  Could you imagine a howling wind coming down 57?  This is good weather to have a king-sized bed, you understand?  And ice all over the place and snow.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah.  It's going to be unwalkable.  Unwalkable.  Oh, you want in?  Who wants the picture?  I see something going on here.  Oh, are we doing pictures?  Oh, sorry. 
[02:15:00]  Let me get in here.  There you go.  There we go.  Because, of course, you need both of us to...  All right.  I'm just doing it for the heat from the flash.  Yeah, because it's my man's nipples.  Jesus Christ.  Cold.  His tits are gorgeous.  Hey, we left Ziggy and his stupid bikes behind.  Oh, have him pedal.  Have him pedal.  All right, Ziggy, what do you want to do?  This is your bit.  I'm doing it from the corner of the XM.  What do you want to do?  Come on, Steve. 
[02:15:30]  Let's get Steve over here.  I hope someone gets hurt on these stupid little bicycles.  I hope someone gets hurt.  Why won't Meatloaf know that this sucks?  Yeah.  I know.  Thanks, Meatloaf.  Oh, shit.  Because why wouldn't Meatloaf know this sucks?  What's Meatloaf going to know?  You know something?  This homeless guy that took over our other homeless guy's spot.  Yeah.  He's got boxes set up.  Yeah.  That's how you know it's going to get cold.  That motherfucker knew yesterday when he built that shelter that it was going to be cold today.  They should be the weatherman. 
[02:16:00]  Homeless people are like the groundhogs.  Is that a rent control corner?  You know what I'm going to do?  There's a guy in here, bro.  Oh, jeez.  I'm going to give him my water that I've been drinking.  I kicked it yesterday.  Yeah, we try to wake him up.  He wouldn't wake up to take money, Patrice.  He got mad at us.  I guess he's got an alarm clock set when he has to go to work.  Go ahead, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Look, I'm on a little bicycle.  Come on, Steve.  Pedal it.  Can you pedal it?  Can you pedal it?  Oh, no, no, no. 
[02:16:30]  You can't ride that, Steve.  Come on.  All eggs and steroids mean nothing.  You still can't ride a baby bike.  Ride that baby bike.  Go ahead, Steve.  Pedal it.  Ride the baby bike.  It's hard, huh?  I can't get my legs up.  You can't get your legs up that high?  Maybe it's those tight jeans, Stevie.  I saw a bear do it in the circus once.  Maybe it's those hot little spandex you got on there.  He is.  Keep your knees out.  All right, let's go.  Look, he's having such a hard...  Oh, he went right on his ass. 
[02:17:00]  Holy shit, that's great.  You got it on video.  That'll be on YouTube.  Welcome to a very downloaded YouTube video because asshole falling off little bike is  going to be hysterical.  Not the first time.  Ziggy knows how to ride it.  How does Ziggy know how to ride it so well?  What else does he have to do during the day?  No, I'm not going to fucking try riding that little bike.  Are you insane? 
[02:17:30]  Yeah.  No, I won't.  Holy...  Right about now, Ziggy's realizing that this was a bad idea.  No, Steve is realizing it was a bad idea.  Take those bikes and shove it in somebody's asshole.  Yeah, let's see it.  That's another one.  Shove it in your asshole.  Hold on.  And have something riding in your asshole.  Hold on.  Let's see.  Ziggy, why don't you ride it across the street?  There you go.  Light has changed.  Honestly, Ziggy, ride it across the street.  When the green man starts blinking reddish, right, he really wished these bikes more. 
[02:18:00]  That is an inconvenient bicycle.  No one gives a fuck about these bikes.  These asses don't even give a shit about that.  New York City doesn't care.  They don't give a crap.  Oh, I hope that bus hits them.  Oh, would a bus hitting him be great?  Ziggy, get it by a bus.  Just riding that thing right under a tire.  He's going in traffic.  Here he goes.  Oh, my God.  He's going.  Why won't Haystack's Calhoun face?  He's in traffic on this little bicycle. 
[02:18:30]  What an asshole.  You went old school on us for trees.  I saw Russell the other day on Madison Square Garden.  Does Madison Square Garden classic?  It's the best channel on the cable system.  They had Chief J Strongbow wrestling.  Those were the good old days.  Oh, man.  It was great.  Look at poor Ziggy with no one giving a fuck.  Why don't you put a picture of you doing that on a t-shirt?  Oh, he tried to do a wheelie. 
[02:19:00]  He even was riding the bike in the middle of traffic hoping that someone would care.  How does he go uphill?  That seems really difficult.  Oh, here go me and my girlfriend's new girlfriend.  Ask her.  Tell her she's got nice hair.  Tell her she's got nice hair.  Ma'am, you have beautiful hair.  Where do you get it done?  You do it yourself?  Really?  Are you in from Dallas?  She's just walking away.  Late for what?  Work?  How much you make an hour?  I'll pay for that one hour. 
[02:19:30]  He went off script.  Shit.  You went off script.  That's why you fell.  What Patrice did was degrade her about the hourly wage.  How about you get an hour?  $20, bitch?  He's $22.50.  Tell him you'll be late.  Oh, look.  Now there's a girl and a guy, and they're riding up the sidewalk on their mini bikes.  What kind of back does that girl have?  I don't know.  There's some kind of... 
[02:20:00]  She has assy things on her back.  There's some kind of spina.  It's spina-itis.  Some kind of assy back.  She has some kind of assy back.  She has a lot of back meat.  God damn it.  That's strange looking.  Wait a minute.  I'm not sure if it was the bicycle the way she was sitting on the bike or something.  I think she had to bend her legs up too much, and there was a muscle that never shows showing. 
[02:20:30]  It's something that should be sexy.  Assy back.  You have a great way of describing stuff with words that don't even exist.  Assy back.  There was a time when you had a microphone in the street.  You could talk to a woman.  Oh, they'd stop for anything, right?  Not now.  Not anymore.  They just have no interest.  Not anymore.  It's like, what's going to happen?  You going to get raped at 7.30 in the morning, you cocksucker?  I love to stay out here and chat, but...  But it's cold. 
[02:21:00]  But it's winter now.  It's cold.  Thank you for riding the bike.  Pork back.  Did you give...  Pork back and meatloaf.  Are we...  Hey, where's Kenny?  Right there.  Kenny.  Yeah.  What about guests?  Don't you pick guests?  Because who is from Pal Talk?  You?  You?  Yeah.  Become some Israeli thing.  I don't know, but he's allowed.  All right.  Just wave you off the right.  All right.  Kenny will invite some people upstairs. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  And no little Jimmy to mock the guy behind the counter.  No.  Dude, it's getting cold.  Oh, my God.  That was really cold today.  I don't know what we're going to do.  It's only, what, October 6th?  It's nothing.  It's nothing now.  It's going to get just colder and colder.  Contingency plan we need.  Sign in, sir.  Sir.  You didn't sign in.  Sign in, man.  My God.  Hi, sir.  How are you?  We'll be up.  Keep us safe. 
[02:22:00]  Keep us safe.  They are the most vile, despicable human beings in the country.  Creeps, ankle biters.  Obviously, the strength is their ability to turn mistruth into something people would believe.  Wow.  How long is this guy going to continue to babble and say nothing?  All day long.  Shut up.  All right.  Here we go.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[02:22:30]  It's worse than I imagined.  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  We are a bunch of dopes.  I think we're lewd.  We're probably pushing 20 arrests because of this radio show.  Out of touch.  Cornwalls.  Three retards.  We have the effect of town hall PM.  Opie.  You know I could have been a model.  Anthony.  I'm dead.  James Norton.  I like yogurt.  Robert Reed. 
[02:23:00]  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:23:30]  We'll be right back. 
[02:24:00]  Let's get the show on the road. 
[02:24:30]  All right.  Shit ass.  Now it's really hot in here.  Yeah, it's warm in here.  Which is good because, you know, I was pretty.  The other joint was really cold this morning.  All right.  All right.  How cold?  How cold is it? 
[02:25:00]  Nah.  Or was it?  Oh.  Get adjusted.  There we go.  Is this a real crocodile's mouth?  Yeah.  I think it is.  You could break that.  I think it is.  What's that?  From Dr. Steve's.  Holy chocolate.  Holy.  Wow.  Wow.  Holy mother of chocolate.  Oh, man.  Chocolate and nuts.  That's good stuff.  Chocolate chip cookies.  Is that just sending you into a tizzy, Patrice?  This is pussy in a bag. 
[02:25:30]  Send you into a diabetic rage or something?  Let me tell you something.  Do you do the cheat with your diabetes?  A little sugar here and there?  Sometimes I do.  Yeah.  I'm pretty good.  Pretty good?  That's not a imposter.  Those goddamn chocolate chip cookies that are in there are so good.  We'll open that bad boy up.  Oh, that's some good stuff.  Or just take the whole thing home.  Oh.  Nah, there's too many fat people in my life.  Nah, that's crazy stuff.  You can't eat all that.  Hey, magazine, a published list of women who have had abortions from CNN.com. 
[02:26:00]  The headline then will be the same next week.  We had abortions.  Fifty-three women were listed in the 1972 debut issue of Ms. Magazine.  More than a thousand names will be printed this time, plus thousands more on the magazine's website.  Women shouldn't be embarrassed by the decisions they make around reproductive health care.  And that includes choosing to terminate a pregnancy.  Kate Horley with Planned Parenthood feels the magazine is sending an important message at a crucial time. 
[02:26:30]  The 1972 edition came out a year before the Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade.  This 2006 edition, at a time when the abortion debate is heating up again.  The Supreme Court now has more conservative justices.  And many states are passing laws to limit abortions.  In South Dakota this year, the legislature banned all abortions except to save a woman's life.  What?  It's not a decision that should be made by the government or politicians. 
[02:27:00]  I don't care.  Yeah.  What?  I say abortions for everyone.  Need them or not.  Whatever.  Here.  Patrice is just now completely fixated on the chocolate basket sent by Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Thanks, Steve.  You fucked up the whole show.  Thank you, Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Those chocolate chip cookies.  That's good stuff.  Kenny, I need something. 
[02:27:30]  What would you like, G.H.?  Hmm.  I need a parfait.  Okay.  If they still have parfaits.  Okay.  Patrice, you want to throw me that box right there?  Which one?  See the cookies?  Right there.  Oh, yeah.  I got half a couple of them.  I got half a couple of them.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Good stuff.  Focus.  Focus.  Oh, focus.  Hard to focus. 
[02:28:00]  Focus with cookies.  Hard to focus.  Um.  Oh.  This stupid abortion thing.  Why?  Whose names are being printed?  I thought it would be celebrities.  That would make it fun.  It's not?  I don't think so.  I think it's just regular Mary Janes.  That sucks.  Yeah.  Who cares?  I thought it was going to be like, because who would I, I would think probably Madonna.  How great would it be?  Barbara Walters.  I'd say Madonna.  Definitely abortion. 
[02:28:30]  Madonna?  Um, yeah.  Uh.  Jessica Simpson.  No.  Um.  No.  Jessica Alba.  Uh.  What's her name?  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Juliette Lewis.  Yeah?  I think.  Probably.  She seems the type.  Probably an abortion?  Yeah.  How about, um.  Chicks that want to keep their body nice?  Katie Kirk.  Nah.  No.  Katie Kirk.  Maybe, maybe earlier in her career.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:29:00]  And it's plaguing her now.  That's so hilarious, man.  What?  Let's talk about who got an abortion.  Who do you think?  Who do you think?  Juliette Lewis is weird.  That's how.  I bet she did.  That's Feruza Bach.  Like.  Definitely Feruza Bach.  Oh, yeah.  Who the hell is that?  She's the one that was in American History X.  She played, uh, the girlfriend.  Okay.  She played, she played all the crazy people after, uh.  Juliette Lewis lost her crazy girl shit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She lost her crazy girl shit to her.  How about.  You don't call her crazy girl shit.  How about Winona Ryder? 
[02:29:30]  Winona Ryder.  Yeah.  Winona.  Winona Ryder.  Yeah.  Maybe.  And Winona Judd, too.  Mm.  Or Ashley Judd.  The one that's a star.  The hot one?  The hot one, I think she probably.  Yeah.  What about the fat one?  No.  I don't think Winona, I don't think, uh, the hot one.  Ready?  What was that?  No, no.  Rosario Dawson had an abortion, definitely.  Oh, yeah.  Every black actress has had at least one.  Oh, no, you motherfucker.  What?  Did you ever say I'm a black actress?  Fuck.  I thought you were finally, uh, getting along here. 
[02:30:00]  Black women don't believe in that shit, man.  No, they have the kids.  Oh, you're right.  They have the kids.  Black women don't believe in that, man.  No, you're right.  Black girls keep that baby.  They have the kids.  No matter what, they know it's a paycheck.  White women don't throw themselves in front of a roller coaster.  God damn, Patricia Wright.  That's true.  Let me see.  How about, how about probably right now.  A birth is an investment.  As racist as I want to be right now.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  I'm going to say that, I'm going to take a chance by saying this bitch may be the finest  bitch alive right now. 
[02:30:30]  Oh.  Jessica Alba.  Yeah, that's not racist.  Yeah, that's bringing the racist together because I don't know what the fuck she is.  No, why?  Because you don't have any, uh, hot black broads.  What?  There's no hot black broads out there.  You got to bring up Halle Berry all the time.  She's getting old.  I know.  She's 40.  She's like the old sneaks.  First of all, let me, let me, let me explain to you something.  I'm going to explain to you something.  Here's, this is, this is not your fault.  Name one hot black broad.  First of all, this is not your fault.  Educate me.  White guy.  Educate me.  This is not your fault.  This is America's fault. 
[02:31:00]  Educate me.  Because young black, uh, female actresses, the hot ones, such as, um, the one that used to  go out with Nick Cannon.  Her name is, um.  Nick Cannon.  She's in this, she was in this, this, this movie, this, this, this monster movie called,  uh, Pulse.  Um, her name is, uh, uh, this is what I'm saying.  Gorgeous young black actresses, uh, Megan Good, you've never heard of.  No.  Um, oh, what's that? 
[02:31:30]  Christina Milian, never heard of.  She, you know what she was in?  She was in that, the Get Shorty, um.  All right, give me a, wait.  The Get, Christina Milian, uh, Megan Good.  Give me the hottest black actress.  Gabrielle Union.  Gabrielle Union.  Gabrielle Union.  All right, wait.  Gabrielle.  And they're, they're, they're not on white people radar.  See, young, young white actresses.  All right, it's fine.  How do you spell last name?  Union, motherfucker, Union.  Oh, yeah.  Right on.  Hot is hot.  It's not a special black way to spell Union.  You never know. 
[02:32:00]  You never know, like, why are you in?  Look, he.  Onion.  Onion.  Like, that was a stupid question.  You see how you guys spell shit?  You know what's hilarious?  Is CBS, you're very non-racist.  Oh, we come here.  XM, you get racist on XM.  My God, put the fucking Klan hats on.  Because we know the black folk can't afford this shit.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  This is terrible.  Terrible.  You know, look, man.  She's, she's hot because she's young.  Let me say. 
[02:32:30]  Megan Good.  I'm looking at Gabrielle Union.  Turn around.  She's a hot girl.  She's fucking as hot as any of these white girls out there.  She's good looking broad.  Look at her.  She's all right.  She's a sexy motherfucker, man.  That's the hottest one you gave me.  I said Megan Good.  Type of Megan Good.  Type of Christina Milian.  I don't know how to spell Milian.  Christina Milian.  That's a tough one.  Hold on.  Christina?  You know what it is?  M-I-L-A-N.  Black actresses, how attractive they are to white America has changed over the years. 
[02:33:00]  Like, we used to look at the daughter in Good Times.  She was a hot black actress to white people.  To white people.  She is the number one, if I had to say all time, sexiest, you know, on any level, black  woman, like most black guys.  Yeah.  I'm looking at Thelma from Good Times.  Thelma from Good Times.  Is the sexiest.  And then, like, Donna Summer was looked at by white America as.  Young Donna Summer.  As a hot.  Yeah.  But as time went on, they had to be less black and more interracial to be accepted 
[02:33:30]  by white people.  Yes, to be accepted by white people.  So now you're looking like Halle Berry.  And now it's even like.  And that's the only one, though.  Right.  Because she's the only gay actress.  But what about Angela Bassett?  A lot of people thought Angela Bassett was gorgeous.  Back in the day.  But she was a little.  White people didn't.  White people didn't.  But let me be fair.  I think one of the sexiest, ugly women in the world is Uma Thurman.  She is horrendous looking.  But she's gorgeous.  Very sexy in Pulp Fiction.  Everything's kind of hit the wall. 
[02:34:00]  She's kind of hit the wall, too, a little bit.  And another one you guys jerk off to constantly, and I don't fucking get it.  She looks like a pussy stinks.  You guys.  Is Angelina Jolie.  Hey, why is Brad Pitt, I'm not a fag, Brad Pitt's sexier than Angelina Jolie.  He can fucking get 27 times better than me.  You can review tapes of me on this very program.  Go back years until when no one knew who the hell she was.  I didn't find her attractive then.  She don't now.  She looks stink. 
[02:34:30]  She doesn't look sexy to me.  Those lips aren't sexy.  They constantly look like they've got to be bathed in lip balm all the time,  or they'll start cracking like a desert floor.  I don't get it.  Like a dried up lake.  Her lips are such high-maintenance things.  If they're not tended to every minute, they just crack open.  Like a dry lake bed, yeah.  Don't get me wrong, I'll fuck them all.  Yeah, hey, don't mistake that for fuckability.  I'm just saying that.  No, don't.  I'll pop Uma Thurman just for the whole novelty of the thing.  I'll pop Uma Thurman. 
[02:35:00]  I think like, but what I was saying was white America has looked at black actresses different  over the years, and they have had to become more white.  Like back in the old days.  Now, did white people ever love Pam Greer?  Pam Greer, no, not like.  She was too black.  Too black.  I'm surprised y'all liked Thelma from Good Times, which I only think you like,  and you're trying to put you and all of them.  No, white America really was into Thelma from Good Times.  I stole the Playboy with her in it.  Yeah.  I asked somebody for that Playboy.  That's right.  I would jerk behind it.  You know what I almost jerked off to the other day? 
[02:35:30]  What?  Motherfucker, quest for fire.  Oh, where they bend over, and he's fucking her from behind, that scene?  There was a scene.  That was every scene.  But before she was like.  She fell in love with him.  They fell in love with each other.  And she goes, no, we're not going to fuck like this.  She turned over.  We're going to fuck like people.  Motherfucker, if my dick didn't fill up.  That was the first time, other than porn, that I was like, oh, that's fucking hot.  That shit, they used to play it on like Cinema 100 when cable was fucking like new. 
[02:36:00]  And you had to turn a key and flip a switch on a box on your television.  And then this movie would come on.  I remember I watched the whole Jaws scrambled.  Yeah.  You'd like fuck with your tuner a little, and you could watch it a little scrambled or a lot.  You squint.  And let's see a little more.  Quest for Fire was like porno.  And there was that scene, because I remember it.  They were all fucking like animals.  And she was like, no, we're not going to fuck like this. 
[02:36:30]  We're going to fuck like people.  It was a love story.  If that didn't turn me on, that at first they always.  Have you seen Quest for Fire?  Not in a while.  And they always fucking her.  Then he started to kind of dig her.  But there was never emotion.  It was just this cave manny.  And after a while, he goes, hey, fellas, enough fucking, she's kind of mine now.  Yeah.  And he would spoon her.  Then she bounced.  Then he went looking for her in a cave manny kind of way.  Like, ugh, where she at?  They just started walking.  And his boys were like, nigga, you a faggot. 
[02:37:00]  But they never emotionalized you a fag.  They just go, mm, what the fuck are you doing?  And then just fell asleep.  He found her, and he had a big caveman dick, and her tribe made him fuck all the fat girls  in the tribe.  Then she started crying, which turned me on.  I was like, she's crying, but he was just, ugh, humping fat girls.  Yeah.  Finally, they got out.  His boys took him out of there.  She escaped with him. 
[02:37:30]  And that was the scene.  And he goes to ride her like usual, like, okay, humping.  She lets him do it for, like, about three or four pumps, and she stops.  The way she fucking turned around, she pulls her right leg up while she's still backwards.  Yeah.  He's going, ugh.  What the fuck is this?  And his boys are going, ugh.  Right?  She lay, and she fucking cocks her legs open as wide as I've ever seen, and pulls his butt 
[02:38:00]  in, and he starts fucking, and he's like, holy.  Oh, what the fuck is this?  And here's the sexy part.  She used to, he used to go, ugh.  And she used to go, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.  She starts going, ugh.  Yep.  And she enjoys it when she, on that position, and they're like, what the fuck?  That was fucking, like, porno.  My, I swear to you, I've never, there's two movies I've been horny at that haven't been  porn.  That one, and, and, and, and Bounty with Mel Gibson, when he goes to. 
[02:38:30]  Oh, come on.  When he goes to that island, and, and all the chicks are just around popless.  And those fine bitches are just in love.  Oh, Fletcher.  Fletcher.  And they just walking around with sexy tits out.  And they got like, and it isn't like, uh, Bushmen of the Kalahari, uh, Africa woman  tits down to their knees.  These have fucking snare drum heads.  Their, their tits were so tight.  And them black Polynesian nips.  Polynesians.  And, and then they, they wanted to fuck the, Pete, the guy so bad that they left the, they 
[02:39:00]  left their people.  Yeah.  And the, and the king, the king's daughter wanted to fuck Mel Gibson.  Yep.  He started crying, cause his daughter's like, I want me some Fletcher Christmas.  They had to fucking leave and all the bitches are cutting themselves up and beating themselves  in the boat.  Quest for fuck.  A couple of nights ago, I've been, I have been.  Those are two great movies.  Obsessed with Quest for, IMD being it, looking at Everest McGill, who, Everett McGill, who's  the star, and fucking Ron Perlman, who I'm not sure even had makeup on. 
[02:39:30]  You know, you know that chick from, uh, from, um, Bounty, she didn't do shit before or after  that.  She's a, she was like introducing her.  She was a real fucking Tahitian, like, she was some Tahiti bitch.  She looked like she was about 17.  Let's go to Turtle and, uh, from Whack Bag Turtle.  Hey guys, Anthony, you had a great line and it got absolutely nothing.  Aw.  You said that, uh, black, uh, black women keep their babies cause that shit's a paycheck. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, that's not a line.  What did you say that?  That's, I stole it from the president's speech.  I stole it from the first lady.  That early, uh, yeah, the first lady, she was talking to the school.  Oh, that movie.  Mafia Life Chris.  Hey, what's up, guys?  What's up, man?  Hey, listen, man.  Speaking of abortion, no filters, Paul's mom should have had one.  Okay.  Uh, but more importantly.  More importantly, I want you guys to play, uh, Dugout Doug's entry, man. 
[02:40:30]  It is hands down the best one out there.  Um, Dugout Doug's entry.  Okay.  We had our MacBook giveaway and, uh, it was for production pieces for the Opie and Anthony  show.  Uh, we had four good days.  The winner for today, we don't think was very good.  No.  But all judges' decisions are final, even if that judge is Danny.  Um, uh, but you're saying Dugout Doug's is better?  Yeah, it's much better.  There's a lot of whining going on right now.  Yeah, a lot of whining coming in on instant feedback on PalTalk saying that, uh, the last 
[02:41:00]  promo stunk.  I gotta agree.  I don't think it was worthy, but I wasn't judging this.  Well, let's hear what Dugout Doug did.  Let's hear what Dugout Doug's sounds like.  Dear Free FM, when I wake up, I want to hear this.  I have no idea what this is.  I don't know how to talk about my music, man.  What happened?  What happened?  I don't know what you're doing without my music.  This is not what I'm used to. 
[02:41:30]  The Opie and Anthony show, 6 a.m. to 9, Monday through Friday, live on Free FM.  After I'm done listening tomorrow, I'm writing another email.  No.  Okay.  I should have won.  I think that's better than the other one.  That's for sure.  It's Angry Typing Guy, and it's the I'm Not Used To.  You know, he plays a little music.  And then it's me and Opie being a little goofy, and he doesn't get it.  It was better than the one we played tonight.  Better than the one that was picked.  Yeah.  What happened, Danny?  Did you hear that one? 
[02:42:00]  Absolutely.  And you chose the other one over that.  I didn't like, I thought it was an unoriginal concept, in my opinion.  Oh, boy.  But the Secret Agent Man thing was...  He had a concept, at least.  What was his concept?  What was the concept?  What was the concept?  It was Kenny doing karaoke and getting booed, and then Junior Soprano shoots him in the gut.  It made no sense.  I'm not alone on this.  It made no sense.  Who's...  Is it that you guys just don't like Dug Out, Doug?  No, it's not that at all. 
[02:42:30]  It's not that at all.  So, I...  It's so obvious that one's so much better than the one we picked today.  The Kenny...  The Kenny thing.  Kenny singing stands alone.  If you just play Kenny singing, it's funny.  So then you put it in something and add the booing, it doesn't really make sense.  It's just Kenny singing with booing.  It's Kenny singing with booing.  Then you add...  That doesn't make any sense.  So it's three things that don't make any sense to put together.  Uh, I didn't get it. 
[02:43:00]  As far as the concept goes.  You don't have to look at me like...  No, I'm not.  Like I'm...  Like I'm the angry boss.  I could give a flying fuck.  Today's was just really bad.  We can still drunk drive and play foosball.  Oh, don't worry.  Thank you.  That's all I...  That's all I care about anyway.  Hysterical video of Steve that has to get on YouTube ASAP.  You saw the video?  No, but I know it's got to be hysterical.  I saw where the camera was, and I saw what happened. 
[02:43:30]  Steve riding that little bicycle over, he flipped up backwards.  The bicycle shot out from under him.  He fell right on his ass, and his little legs were kicking like a baby on the ground.  And I have to see this video.  Can we see it?  Sam's got it.  Sam's got it.  All right.  Well, here's Doug out, Doug.  Doug.  Doug.  Oh, Obi, don't tell me I should have won, because now you're going to make me cry.  Well, yours was better than the one we picked.  I'm not sure if you should have won.  And now I'm starting to think there was a lot of them that were better than the one we picked.  Because there were probably some that were better, but I don't know. 
[02:44:00]  I think yours was better than the one that won, personally.  And I get the angry typing guy is like a ripoff of somebody else on the show, but at least it's like another character.  I mean, at least it was me doing an original entry, not just stringing together five fucking sound clips.  Yeah, it was just kind of, the winner was just sound clips that were put together.  It was Kenny singing, booing, and a sound clip from, yeah, just thrown in.  So, I don't know. 
[02:44:30]  I thought yours was better than the one that won, but I bet I could find other ones that probably I personally would think were better.  But I don't know.  If Doug were to have won, then it would have just been other people calling, oh, you only give these things to your friends.  Oh, it's just friends at the show.  Good point, sir.  Good point.  No, it doesn't matter, though.  If it's a good entry, it's a good entry.  I don't care who wins him.  And you're absolutely right.  It's just I didn't feel it was.  That was better than that horse shit we was listening to earlier.  The one that won for today was probably, like, my personal opinion, so bad. 
[02:45:00]  It didn't even deserve to be played as being so bad that it's kind of good.  Like, it's so bad.  I voted for it, too.  Wow.  Yeah.  Why?  Just, you know comedy.  Yeah, I know.  You guys are shell-shocked over the week, I think.  You heard too many.  It's, you know, all due respect to Doug, I listened to 200 of them.  That's number 100.  It's exactly in the middle, completely unacceptable. 
[02:45:30]  All right.  Even if you thought that, I think the one that won is 199.  That's fine.  But to me, it was at least something that was different.  It was not just, like, a...  I still don't get the Club Soda Kenny one.  It's just to me, I painted a picture of Club Soda Kenny going up on stage and dying and getting a shot.  And it was just...  You're laughing.  You just described that.  In reality, that's a great concept.  I would like to see it.  I'm still hearing crickets in my own head, though.  Kenny singing and getting shot is a funny thing, but... 
[02:46:00]  All right.  All judges' decisions are final, Doug.  All right.  I do apologize.  Doug hung up on us.  Yeah, well.  He's all angry now.  But angry Doug is redundant.  To the person that right now is typing in, mine was better.  No, it wasn't.  Okay.  Everybody thinks theirs is better, and it's not.  I'm sorry.  Or it sounded like everybody else's and is completely unexceptional.  That's true, too.  A lot of them that think that theirs are good are not good. 
[02:46:30]  We thought this would be a no-brainer contest.  We got the MacBooks.  It was.  Everyone with no brain entered, but...  Nothing?  Okay.  You know what the problem was?  I should have given the LARPing promo in today and Monday's promo.  We'd have been like, oh, my God.  Yeah, because the contest started with the LARPing promo winning the first MacBook.  Yeah.  But that was such a slam dunk.  We went downhill from there.  Yep.  That really was a great one.  We're using that one, right?  Yeah.  We threw that in the system?  Cool.  All right. 
[02:47:00]  Why don't we take a break?  And you want to do the top ten country songs in America?  We had fun last time.  We haven't done that in a while.  We also have, oh, yeah, students form White People Club in Arizona State.  All these fucking...  Movement to arm teachers with guns.  Professor Gibbs lecture while obviously stoned.  How many friggin' school shootings have there been?  How many kids go to school on a daily basis? 
[02:47:30]  Give me a percentage.  I don't think we have to arm the fucking teachers.  Yeah, but no, it's weird.  I was thinking that, too, in terms of percentages.  Which is like...  Yeah.  But you know what's weird, though?  I was at Shea Stadium for the game the other day.  They have more security and more armed guys there than our schools.  It's...  And no one's gotten killed at a game like from shootings, I think.  Nothing happened at that sporting event.  No.  It just looks silly to me when you see the guys with their M16s and everything outside Shea,  but, you know, the schools are unprotected. 
[02:48:00]  It's a little weird to me.  Well, they protected a school once.  It was called Kent State.  They had the National Guard there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That kind of didn't turn out too well, but...  Yeah, it calmed them down, though.  It did.  I think they're a lot better at that.  Goddamn hippies.  Show them.  Shut them up.  Back to class.  Loud mouths.  Troublemakers.  Tony.  Hey.  Hey.  I just called to say, fuck you, man.  I own XM and I'm black.  I'm listening to you on a little bit of a delay.  I ran into the store to get something and came back out. 
[02:48:30]  I'm like, what the fuck?  I'm a black dude.  You sound upwardly mobile, sir.  I like that.  You went into a store to get something,  or are they chasing you right now as you speak?  Dude, fuck you again, man.  Guy's very well-spoken.  He has a very good job.  It's because he works around white folks,  but he's black.  Works around white folks.  Yeah, I do work around you damn white people.  You're absolutely right.  Aren't we a pain in the ass?  Crack-ass, crack-ass.  Sometimes I have to turn the radio off 
[02:49:00]  when I bring my wife in the car, man,  because she's like super militant.  She's like, what the fuck are you listening to?  What the hell?  Yeah, really, dude.  Be careful, man.  Oh, man.  She's going to make me get back my black man card  listening to you guys, man.  I swear to God.  I knew you guys had those.  See?  Yeah.  See?  You got the black man card.  The black man card.  I didn't fucking dispute that.  You got a black man card.  Let me see it.  You can't see my black man.  That's how you lose it, showing it to white people.  It's counterfeited.  It's over.  I know I can't show it to you guys. 
[02:49:30]  I almost lost it for just telling you about it, man.  Listening to your show as a black person probably is...  It's hard.  Being on your show as a black person?  Yeah, that's rough.  Probably very hard.  It's good, though, if you come off, which you do, like you're a defender of the faith  here, you know.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not...  You're not sitting here going, yes, I'm, Ms. Obey and Anthony.  There's some...  There are some...  There's some black things that I just don't like.  Like, look at...  I think, like, remember a long time ago, there was some of our black quarterbacks and, like, 
[02:50:00]  Russell Limbaugh said something about black...  Yeah.  Like, look, there's enough black quarterbacks playing right now for you to be able to say  some of them suck as a white person.  To be able to go, you know what, Donovan McNabb sucks.  Oh, you a racist.  No, that nigga suck.  I like...  I like the other motherfucker from Baltimore, Steve McNair, but this...  It's like enough black quarterbacks now where you don't have to fucking...  Right.  Always...  Enough!  In other words, you're taking over one of the white positions that...  Oh, slowly but surely. 
[02:50:30]  We had...  But you can't play it anymore.  It's dumb.  Hold on.  Tony from Brooklyn.  We got slowpoke motherfuckers.  We got Brian from D.C. wants to talk to Tony from Brooklyn.  Brian says...  Oh, shit.  Here we go.  I'm a real...  That uppity...  That uppity nigga ain't never watched Martin a day in his life, man.  Never watched Martin.  I'm a real nigga.  I'm a real nigga.  I play that much.  And I've been listening to Sean Niggas on J.L. King in D.C. back in the day.  And I've been listening...  I've been listening since...  The first time I listened to this show, Anthony was talking about how his mom was 
[02:51:00]  banging...  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Hold on a second.  Hold on a second.  Some shit like that, man.  Come on, man.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This dude here talking here is very upply mobile.  Let me tell you why.  Yeah.  That's Tony.  The other dude...  Brian from D.C.  He came at Tony in a very black way.  He certainly did.  Tony's response should have been like, suck my dick, motherfucker.  I watch Martin, nigga.  You don't know what the fuck I watch, bitch. 
[02:51:30]  I got all the seasons on DVD, faggot ass nigga.  But Tony goes, listen, I have been a faithful...  When you use the word...  When a nigga uses the word faithful, there's certain words a nigga can't use.  There's certain things a nigga can't do.  One is make the air quote sign.  Right.  Never do that.  And two is go, you know, I've been a faithful listener to anything.  Black people, we hate our most shit first.  What qualifies me as upply mobile?  Is it how much money I make?  Is that what it is? 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  You see your faggot ass talk, man.  I got it for dreams.  I got it.  I got what's going on here.  So because your punk ass is making about $25,000 a year,  and I'm making about $25,000 a year,  so I'm a faggot ass punk.  That's what you're trying to say, my brother?  So you're saying Tony has a better job,  makes more money than Brian just by their voices?  Not necessarily.  Well, you don't want to go there, but I'll go there.  Tony, what do you do for a living?  What's that?  What do you do for a living?  I sell surgical equipment. 
[02:52:30]  All right.  Brian from D.C., what do you do for a living?  I sell cars, man.  What?  I sell cars.  You sell cars.  Oh, fuck out of me.  Wait a minute.  Yes, he does, and I'm going to tell you what car sales me is,  because this is new corporate America.  All right.  What they do.  All right.  They hire fucked out motherfuckers to relate to a nigga when he comes in.  They have him at PC Riches around me where they go,  What's up, nigga?  Oh, is that it?  Fuck that old cracker-ass Panasonic.  Holy shit.  Nigga, you got to buy a motherfucking nigga-ass Sony, bitch,  and you go, 
[02:53:00]  Get the fuck out of here.  You got to buy a Sony.  Nigga.  You know, I ain't even going to front the street.  That's why I work at one of those.  Your job is a credit card dealership.  I ain't even going to front.  Like, you know, your job is a credit, one of those shit.  Yeah.  I work at one of those.  And he relates to it.  You know, and I relate to it.  Like, yo, nigga, you got to copy.  Yep.  They hire him.  Oh, my God.  I didn't know this was going on.  They hired a new brand of, of, of,  they hired different black men for different shit.  Right.  Are you kidding?  Patrice, he's that dude that they hire for the people that have no credit. 
[02:53:30]  You know what I'm saying?  When they have that, um, you know, credit, bad credit, you know,  fucked up credit, come on down.  He's the one that they talk to when he comes down.  No niggas is buying surgical equipment.  So, you don't, you don't need to relate to a nigga.  If a nigga buys surgical equipment, he's also going, you know,  um, how much is a scalpel?  Scalpel.  You know, a stethoscope, and I know how to spell it, by the way.  Yeah, yeah.  It's like, you don't need to relate to, like, the, the street brother  as much as you do, like, where they have these new, the new dudes that, 
[02:54:00]  the, the, the motherfuckers that go, yo, yo, yo, in regular shit now.  So now, now you see a guy pull up to the car lot, and, uh, it's a black guy  pulling up in some piece of shit car.  Maybe his girl's dropping him off, and he needs a car.  You will come out to him.  A conscious decision will be made in, inside.  You'll look out and go, all right, you take this guy.  He takes him, because he'll go out, and he'll go, yo, man, you got a cop.  Like, he said cop.  He, he knows all the lingo. 
[02:54:30]  He's black enough.  See, you can't be black, you have to have something black, be black enough  to have white people not understand you.  You can't be black enough.  He got a, you, he has to, he ain't Will Smithy black.  He's, uh, let me give a, like, I don't know even who to say on TV.  Like, but he has to be able to go, he has to use words that motherfucking white people  never heard of.  That way, you know, because if a white guy goes out there and starts going, well, I  think this automobile will be fine for you, sir, and you're looking like, fucking white 
[02:55:00]  guy, what, he's just trying to fuck me over again.  Yeah.  But then, uh, brother comes out and starts, uh, talking, and, and now you, yeah.  Nigga, yo, get, cause black people.  It opens up like a door in his brain, like, like, it's, it's like the same fucking price  the white dude would give him, but it just sounds better, cause I'm saying this shit.  Holy shit.  And black people don't give a fuck about Hemi engines, cause I'm, I wanted, I was looking  at that, that Dodge, uh, Charger, but black people ain't really up on.  Vroom, vroom.  The Hemis and the, we're up on rims, so if he was selling a car to a motherfucker who 
[02:55:30]  came in his way, he'd be like, yo, nigga, yo, if you get these motherfucking 20s.  He knows.  Yeah.  Yo, I saw one last week, I saw one last week with 22s on it, and I, yeah, it was, it was  a regular shit, it wasn't, it wasn't the one with the Hemi, it was a black Dodge Charger,  the 2006, he didn't give a fuck about the Hemi, but he didn't give a fuck about the Hemi,  but he didn't give a fuck about the Hemi, but he didn't give a fuck about the Hemi.  He just wants some friggin' rims.  That's why when we, when we go into a sneaker store, nobody, we're the easiest people to  sell sneakers to, cause it's like white people, oh, white men come and go, uh, the, the gel 
[02:56:00]  system.  What about cross-training?  Niggas go, hey, yo, give me that shit, cause it matched my hat, motherfucker.  Oh man.  The hottest shoes could be for $20, but then you gotta put a one in front of that shit.  We're not paying $20 for no shoes, man.  We, we, we're paying at least a buck for some shoes.  You need to pay more.  We need to pay $100.  It don't matter.  Wait a minute now.  This motherfucker, Patrice, Patrice is giving you fuckin' props.  No.  Brian is saying, uh, he's, he's speaking the truth. 
[02:56:30]  Patrice is totally like, yeah.  But Tony's not happy with this.  What's that?  Tony, you're, you're not happy about this.  No, man.  I mean, that, that, come on.  There's more, there's more.  There's more, there's more.  Oh man.  I don't like that, man.  Come on now.  Oh man.  Motherfucker, all these lofers around the house, man.  Fuck out of the house, motherfucker.  What are you talkin' about?  You livin' in a fuckin' project or a crackhead.  Nah, nigga.  Nah, nigga.  Wait a minute.  PG County, nigga.  OB, wait a second now.  I'm learning here, go ahead. 
[02:57:00]  This, the, the, the, which one's Tony?  Tony's the, uh, from Brooklyn.  Okay.  Upload Mobile.  Upload Mobile.  He's black.  Yeah.  I'm gonna tell you why.  Mm-hmm.  There's insults that a black man give another black man, right?  What kind of insult is you wear loafers around the house?  It's, it's something that white people might do.  Right.  So you insult a motherfucker with something white people might do.  Something white.  Well, if you go, you go, wait a minute, I, what if I do wear loafers around my house,  you motherfucker? 
[02:57:30]  That means you're not black.  What is an insult?  Nigga, you probably walk around, you probably wear a robe, bitch.  Cause white people, you.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh. 
[02:58:00]  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh. 
[02:58:30]  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  I'm a realist.  How do you skirt that one?  Are you kidding me?  I'm a realist.  Oh, wait, wait.  That stuff he says in the office isn't on the air.  You're right.  I'm sorry.  We're talking about the on-air, Anthony.  Hey, Opie throws around the word swoggy all the time.  I like the word swoggy.  No shit.  At least Anthony know he a whore.  He move out on Long Island and don't fuck with no niggas.  That's right.  I got the fuck out of there.  You know what I'm saying? 
[02:59:00]  Anthony know he a whore.  Hey, before you hang up, hey, Anthony, hey, Anthony, if y'all do the country shit,  do that Arnold Schwarzenegger shit again, man.  That shit is funny as a motherfucker because I was watching a motherfucker.  Wait, wait, wait.  The what?  The Arnold Schwarzenegger movie last night.  I missed.  The Arnold Schwarzenegger shit.  Oh, yeah.  My name is John.  Dirk Bentley.  Hi, John Smith.  Dirk Bentley.  Yeah, Dirk.  Dirk Bentley.  I still got love for you, Opie, you pretty bitch.  Come on, Sarge.  I'm not that bad. 
[02:59:30]  Oh, man.  Imagine hearing that in a joint.  Oh, shit.  Hey, look.  This is the only time you can talk shit to Opie and shit when Jimmy ain't got his back.  You, you, you, you have Jimmy always using college words.  You know you got your back.  College words?  Jimmy doesn't get my back.  Jimmy's got my back, you think?  Jimmy always got your back.  Patrice has got my back, right, Patrice?  Not often.  Jimmy always got your back.  All right, Sarge.  Jimmy always got your back.  Hey, but I got love for you white motherfuckers. 
[03:00:00]  All right, Sarge.  You all right?  You all right?  Wow.  Oh, God damn.  All right.  Now this stuff is coming in.  John from Brooklyn.  We're learning.  What's going on?  We want to learn about the black man today, I guess.  What's up, John?  Yeah, I want to know why when the brothers, why do they wear on their hat the size of what  their head is when they get a brand new hat or even a hat in general?  And this isn't just blacks.  Whites do it, too.  They'll have like this seven and a quarter stick is still on. 
[03:00:30]  It's to do anything.  I have a theory on it.  Oh, well, you talk about it.  We were just going to have Patrice explain it.  But you ask the question and give the answer.  Patrice could go ahead.  I'm sorry.  No, I'm just saying.  The real reason is to do anything that's completely not like, okay, I'll tell you immediately  how you know it's a white guy's hat.  Uh-huh.  Immediately.  It's bent.  It's bent.  It's bent, yeah.  We know that.  It's a fucking bent.  Bent.  But the white guys are starting to go with the flat.  With the flat, but not really white guys.  The hip guys who are claiming hip hop. 
[03:01:00]  It's not as much as a color thing as a cultural thing.  Anything to not be white.  Right.  So keeping your sticker.  No matter how ridiculous it looks.  I think it's fucking retarded.  I don't wear my sticker on my fucking head.  I've seen the tags in the bill hanging, dangling in people's faces.  And it's not to take it back.  It's to take it back.  Because I've seen old ones with the sticker on it.  Right.  It's like, nigga, there's a sweat line on top of that motherfucker.  You got the sticker?  You're not bringing that back.  He wants to take it back after three years of years. 
[03:01:30]  Man, I got to tell you, I don't think I'd bring it back on a Hartford Whalers hat.  I don't get the baseball cap that's straight across.  I think it looks ridiculous.  My theory is that when you walk it through the mall, it's a hat store.  You take it right off the rack and slap it on your head.  It's like it's just stolen.  Like, I just took this hat and that's it.  Why does it have to get to theft, sir?  Because it's like, no, this hat's brand new.  I took it.  It's just like Patrice said. 
[03:02:00]  It's anything that is going to make white America look and go, why are they different?  Why do they have to do that and be different?  It's to be different than white America.  A couple more.  Let's go to Bill in Georgia.  Bill.  Hey, what's up, man?  What up?  Yeah, I got a question, man.  What's up with them saving up for 15 years to put rims on a 14-year-old Monte Carlo?  That old gag.  It's not an old gag.  I don't get it either.  I don't see really old cars.  Why are the nice rims on the cars?  Why?  The rims are worth more than the fucking car. 
[03:02:30]  You got to have a nice car these days, though, too.  You can't just.  It's not about.  You know, I remember years ago it was.  You would see a real piece of shit with nice rims on it.  Yeah, but nowadays you just get laughed at.  What's up with the rims in general?  I don't get it.  When I look at a nice car, I don't even look at rims.  Nice feet.  They do the same thing you have with nice, clean shoes.  They do what they see with on the TV.  Listen, man.  White people.  No, they don't.  No, we don't.  White people.  Black people have this unknown thing where we all know the same shit, but we don't reach 
[03:03:00]  out to each other.  It's just.  It's virile.  In your genetics.  In our genetics.  That's why I say it's the same reason why, like, a riot.  How can a riot break down unless everybody feels the same?  No one goes, all right, everybody.  Start fucking up shit.  It just.  It just happens.  All right, everybody.  Call a friend.  Pass it on.  Cheer, because OJ.  It's like, you don't, you don't announce that.  What happens is, when I, you just want to be as nice as possible and be, that's why  rappers are like heroes, because it, like these two arguments here, like the fucking, 
[03:03:30]  the Tony and my man.  It's because you, you feel like you have to be this type of Negro to be upwardly mobile,  but rappers have made motherfuckers that walk around with a tattoo on their neck, on their  eyelids, say, suck my dick, nigga.  Here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna buy a motherfucking Phantom, which is the real car that the, that the Chrysler  300's trying to be, a Phantom for $250,000, and nigga, I'm gonna put $10,000 worth of 
[03:04:00]  rims on that motherfucker to make it look, to match my, the inside of my fucking dashboard,  bitch.  It's a, it's saying to you, motherfuckers, suck my dick.  It's saying I can, you know what?  My clothing costs as much as a nigga's suit when he goes to Wall Street, motherfucker.  My jeans, and my motherfucking Seattle superstar, and my hat, my Coogee hat, come up to about  as much as a white boy walking around in the street, and I'm very proud of that.  I'm very proud. 
[03:04:30]  That's your suit.  That, that's my fucking suit.  I don't have to feel like I go to court, and I, every day's casual day for me, bitch.  I'm niggering it up.  But now, a white guy would walk by and not know from a fucking hole in the wall, but any  black guy is gonna walk by you and go, ooh, that, that motherfucker paid some money for  this shit.  He knows this is sharp.  This Coogee hat, nigga, gonna know this hat's sharp, man.  It's, it does, it's not a, it's just, it's our way of not being you, but being you. 
[03:05:00]  In your own, in your own circle.  With that said, we go to Russ.  God damn.  I'm gonna have to take notes on today's show.  I gotta listen to the replay and write all this down.  Russ in Ohio.  It, it leads to this question.  Hey, you guys have gotta have Patrice on more often.  I'm learning more about black people than I ever wanted to know.  Got a question for Patrice.  Why is it a black guy can wear an oversized jersey and a hat sideways, looks cool, Norton  does it, he looks like he's with Special Olympics.  He looks like he has cancer because it's not, you can feel that Norton's really would never 
[03:05:30]  be a part of that.  Norton is tight jeans and Dark Martin boots.  That's what Norton is.  He has a tight jeans, Dark Martin build, and there's a certain walk you have to have to  pull things off.  Sabbath t-shirt.  I'm trying to think about the blackest person you got around that can almost be, Danny has  the movements and the attitude of a black man.  Really?  Danny. 
[03:06:00]  Danny.  He kind of looks for the little black.  He has a swagger that's black, it's a thing that Danny could pull off black shit.  He could pull it off because he has a thing about him, but like...  I think because he lives among the brothers.  I don't know what it is, but Danny has a thing about him.  It's among the brothers.  It's an attitude, man.  It's an attitude.  You live among the brothers, Danny.  Sort of, right?  More than like E-Rock does.  More than I do.  Danny's a cornball, but he has a thing with him. 
[03:06:30]  He has a thing with him.  Look at him.  He's like a cool dude.  What nationality are you, by the way?  Like Russian Jew, actually.  Wow.  That's odd.  You should have Danny dress up like a black dude and see if he pulls it off.  He makes the part.  I think he would.  But like, look at E-Rock, man.  He's just...  Oh, he's the whitest guy ever.  He's just whitest.  Look at his shoulders.  His shoulders scrape the ground.  His self-esteem is in disarray.  He just...  He desperately doesn't want to be black. 
[03:07:00]  And Danny...  Not Danny.  E-Rock looks in the mirror and wishes he could move like something other than what y'all made him.  He's just a sad, soggy kid.  And he doesn't want to be like that.  If he wasn't a grown man, that's a high school shooting waiting to happen in fucking E-Rock.  You just want to smack his hat off.  But you see a nigga walking...  You don't feel like you want to slap him.  But see, I'm not going to front him.  I've said this before.  I know how black I am. 
[03:07:30]  I'm black enough to go up to the high hundreds in Manhattan.  Maybe 145th.  Yeah.  All right.  Go around the room.  How high up can we all go?  For the people around America...  Wow.  That's pretty good.  Okay.  Wait, wait, wait.  Okay, go ahead.  For the people around America, it's a known fact.  Like, if you're white, you don't go past 100, more or less.  Usually you want to stay down in the 90s.  Right.  But, you know, once you go to 100... 
[03:08:00]  States go up, you go past 100, it starts getting scary.  But it's a certain look, though.  All right.  So go around the room.  And how you handle yourself, how you walk, things like that.  Right.  And your face is like the thousand-yard stare, what your face is.  Exactly.  We're on 57th Street right now.  How much higher could all of us go?  I'm going to lie, Opie.  Your face...  You better go downtown right now.  You're too high right here.  Wherever the Weizenfall Center is, where it's kind of funny, uptown, like, you might get 
[03:08:30]  to 100 to some kind of, like, little trendy bar or something.  Weird nook up there somewhere, yeah.  We did a photo shoot up there for Boston.  Yeah, something for the Boston.  Boston pulled out for a Boston newspaper, and they had us...  How high up, man?  That was scary.  We were pretty high up there.  Yeah.  But anyway, guys.  I would say 120, because 125th is becoming gentrified, but any place where, you know,  there wasn't a bunch of white people that lived there, you could never go to 130. 
[03:09:00]  Like, you couldn't.  130's bad?  You would be uncomfortable.  What's up with 130?  That's where it's...  I thought 100 was scary.  They'd smell the fear on you.  Yeah, and they could see your hips move like somebody who rollerblades.  When you walk in shoes, you move your hips like a nigga that...  You couldn't go past 130.  He could go past 130 and above, because people would think Anthony's a cop.  He looks grizzled, and he has a grizzled, hard look.  Like a narc.  Look, he does.  He was. 
[03:09:30]  Eric, not past 125th.  He's another one.  Than, it's possible he could go up to 145 to 150, because they would think he was a fucking  cop, or a college kid that even gangsters...  Wait a minute.  Even gangsters...  See, you would get robbed before Than or before E-Rock, because black people and Puerto Ricans  know that prey on people.  You would get too much heat around the neighborhood if you did something to somebody like Than walking 
[03:10:00]  around your neighborhood.  Yeah.  Almost like the Charles Stewart situation.  That's why you know that black people didn't kill Charles Stewart, because no black man  would kill a pregnant white woman.  The hardest nigga wouldn't kill a pregnant white woman in the hood.  So, you might get robbed.  When that story came out, you were like, oh my God.  You're like, nigga, get the fuck out of here.  Ain't no niggas, don't niggas don't do that.  They're not robbing no pregnant fucking white woman in a Volvo in the hood.  It don't happen, because we know what would happen is what happened when he said a nigga 
[03:10:30]  did it, is they come and they rake the entire neighborhood.  You don't look like a cop, Opie.  Fucking logic is the greatest.  You don't look like a cop.  So, that's why I'm in trouble.  You are in trouble, because you don't look like a cop, and you're too old to be any good  to society with somebody.  So, you look like you can be robbed.  You don't look like a college student.  You're not a white girl.  You look like you can be robbed, because it's like, you look like the top motherfucker that 
[03:11:00]  a cop would fuck with, too, because he would go, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, what are you looking for?  Drugs are...  And a black dude, or whoever, a motherfucker that's preying on people would go, fuck something,  man.  What you looking for, man?  You a cop, nigga?  No, and you're not a cop.  We should do a contest.  We all start walking from right here, and see who bails last.  See who bails last.  Oh, my...  Oh, wow.  See, like, we'll play chicken.  And I'm not even kidding, because I...  Uptown chicken.  You'll keep going, but Anthony will bail, because Anthony really doesn't give...  I've taken... 
[03:11:30]  He'll bail at 90.  I'll bail, yeah.  I've taken the walk north just for the hell of it, and I get up to, like, maybe like  110-ish, and I get scared.  I'm not going to lie to you.  Well, 110 in Amsterdam, or 110 in...  Like, 110 in Broadway is perfectly white.  110 in Western Avenue is perfectly white.  Western Avenue is at, like, 106.  But 110 in Broadway, 110 in Columbus...  Yeah, no, it's not that bad.  That's white, but...  Eastside, 110.  That's what I'm saying.  I was more east of that. 
[03:12:00]  Eastside, 110 is...  And I got scared around 110.  It was broad daylight on, like, a dumb Tuesday afternoon.  I get nervous in the Bronx.  After 145th, 145th and Broadway...  That might as well be another country that hasn't even been discovered yet.  They can sniff.  I'm not from around here.  I haven't even been discovered.  I'm not even kidding.  There are big slave ships pulling up.  I can't even imagine what 145th is all about.  It's a whole other time and place.  I'll tell you what.  Because we've been aware of this our entire lives.  Over 100, you guys started wondering what the hell's going on, right? 
[03:12:30]  145, I couldn't even tell you what's up there.  145, they have slang.  All I know, this is all the street knowledge I have...  And this is what you've been told.  ...to survive in 145th, is knowing that when some Puerto Rican or Dominican says something  to me that's a question, and I don't understand it, I don't go, huh.  I go, nah, I'm good.  Because it's going to be a drug because it's a new, yo, got that fist scale.  You go, huh, I got that fist scale.  I got that fist scale.  Or that, um, they call it, um, they call, they call it, uh, uh, uh, uh, oh, it's fist scale, 
[03:13:00]  but it's another one they call, um, yo, smoking that, uh, shh, ah, forgot it.  But see, that shit'll get you killed.  Fist scale is the new shit for Coke, and they go, got that fist scale, and I go, nah, I'm good.  What?  But I don't know what the fuck it is.  Fist scale?  Fist scale, then.  Why?  I don't know, nigga.  All I know is his fist scale. 
[03:13:30]  All I know is he's good, nah.  I know it's just one guy just making this shit up for everybody else.  They used to call it Sherman Hemsley used to be, um.  Yeah, yeah.  Sherman Hemsley used to be something.  Some kind of drug.  You got Sherman Hemsley, do you?  Yeah, I got that Sherman Hemsley.  Where is he?  I'm looking for Wheezy.  I'm looking for the Wheezy, nigga.  So you would be scared at what, 145?  After 145th, I get...  What's the difference at 145 and above?  It's a, it's murder.  Like, it's...  Yeah.  Now you're just talking all out murder. 
[03:14:00]  It's murder.  It's niggas sell drugs.  It's like going in the ocean where the sun doesn't shine anymore, right?  Yeah, you got the fish with the light on top of the head.  Light on their head and big teeth.  Niggas sell drugs like it's legal.  Because it is, pretty much.  They don't, see, they don't go...  Motherfucker at one...  Say 160.  60?  He'll go, he'll go...  Motherfucker go, yo, I got that cocaine, nigga.  Like, you go...  What?  What?  It ain't no trick word for it?  Yeah.  Like, Washington Square is like, hey, got that floaty booty, got that booty booty.  Hey, got that honey child, got that tickle tickle. 
[03:14:30]  145th niggas go, yo, you snorting, motherfucker?  Because I got shit for you to snort up your motherfucking nose, nigga, which is coke.  Pulls a kilo out of his pocket so he can look at it.  Yo, when you come out of the diamond store, fat man, I got cocaine for you.  A brick, nigga.  Maybe two bricks, bitch.  That's amazing.  In the streets.  That's amazing.  It ain't sneaky no more.  The fucking cops leave you alone.  Do they give toys up there?  Toys.  Toys.  Toys.  I want to get on one of those double-decker buses. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, double-decker buses take some English people.  Those Dominicans are 146th, man.  People from Ireland up there.  It's a look that even if you try to fake it...  They'll see right through.  They know you're not from here.  Even if you're not from there, you ain't from what I do.  It's like being cut and swimming at the Great Barrier Reef.  There's nothing you can do about it.  You're not going to fool the shark into saying, I'm not bleeding.  I can walk up there and they know that I'm from the hood, but they know that I'm not there. 
[03:15:30]  From there, right.  From there.  Wow.  That just...  Well, I never have to worry about it.  I've never, ever gone up there.  I would never go up there.  I have no reason to.  Why would I?  That's the same thing in Long Island, though.  You know?  Yeah.  It's just like this...  I don't need to go to Long Island.  Like, I see a black guy walking around my neighborhood.  I know he doesn't belong there.  I just know it.  Unless he does.  Unless he's working.  But you would know one that did belong.  Right.  Exactly.  You would know one that lived there. 
[03:16:00]  You would know one...  Yeah.  ...that...  You go, this guy's from...  Yeah, he's...  This guy's from Long Island.  You could tell.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pulls his Mercedes around into his house.  There, I got the wife, the kids.  We're just like a commercial.  What's the...  Howdy, neighbor.  What's the worst area in New York?  I would say parts of the Bronx.  East New York, Brooklyn.  East New York, Brooklyn used to be...  See, I don't even know that anymore.  They're building it up, man.  They got million dollar brownstones over there now, man.  They clean it up. 
[03:16:30]  And they're getting ready to build...  How are they convincing someone to buy one of those?  The Nets, man.  The Nets stadium is going to happen.  It's happening.  They did buy the Nets.  Wow.  It's going down, man.  That's going to be amazing.  They eminent domain in motherfuckers over there right now.  I just know from reading in the paper, there's still a lot of fucking killing going on in Brooklyn.  And they didn't buy the Nets.  They kidnapped them.  Well, where I live at...  You're playing here.  And I have to...  It's like, it's hard for you to understand, but I think I completely...  I'm almost a white guy.  It just...  It's because I think in terms of property, and I think in terms of future, 
[03:17:00]  and I look at something bad that happens to somebody else, and I go, oh, that's terrible.  It's unnecessary.  One of my neighbors get his window broke because he's on the corner where kids...  It's a...  They're half million dollars, million dollar places, right?  And it's in an area where no one can afford to buy them except for motherfucking white people  and Chinese stockbrokers, so the kids come and they fucking throw rocks through the window.  Oh, Jesus.  I used to be one of them kids that would just...  And you don't think... 
[03:17:30]  Now you look like, hey...  And I'm like, oh, God, they're breaking windows.  If there's something that has to be done around here, we have to meet with the condo association?  It's like...  Oh, shit.  I'm like that.  I'm like that now, but I'm trying to stay hood.  Like, I'm trying to stay hood, like, talking to the former, like, yo, man, how the fuck you going, nigga?  You know what happened?  Why ain't you got no brothers working up here?  You know what happened?  You lost your accent.  It's like when someone comes here from another country slowly, but surely they lose their accent.  You've lost your accent.  It's not an audible accent.  It's like this ultra-high-frequency accent that you can't hear, but they know it. 
[03:18:00]  They sense it in your voice.  Because I want things to be better.  Any nigga that wants things to be better, or nigga that don't want things to be better, hears it.  Someone's saying fish scale is actually crack, not coke.  It's still coke.  It's something, motherfucker.  What does it think it's made out of?  Cookie mix?  All right, that fucking shit's cocaine, asshole.  There you go.  Let's go to Doug.  Well, because it shines like fish scale.  Oh, is that it?  Oh, we just made that up with so much confidence, too. 
[03:18:30]  That kind of sounds like it.  Like, you know, because you have to see fish scales.  You read it?  No, someone who's educated about that stuff.  That makes sense, though.  It does.  Ask them what the new word for weed is.  It's some new word that they just, out of nowhere.  I just get all my information from rap, so I have a clue of what the fuck is going on.  I can't even understand enough of rap to decipher it.  It's like a whole other language that I don't know any piece of to even decipher it.  Let's go to Doug in Baltimore.  Doug?  Hey, what's going on? 
[03:19:00]  Hey, man.  I want to answer me one thing.  Why does a mother man got to walk in the street and not on the sidewalk?  Black man walk in the street and not on the sidewalk?  Even worse.  I don't know.  Why do black men walk right in front of your car?  To say fuck you.  Yeah, it is.  Everything we do.  You're that confident.  Everything we do that white people don't get, Opie, is to say fuck you.  That someone's not going to just, you know, take you out?  It's a dare.  A white guy ain't going to run over a black guy.  You know what it is?  It's a dare.  It's a respect thing.  I've cut off two motherfuckers driving. 
[03:19:30]  I'm a real fucked up driver.  I'll get in there.  I won't turn on a blinker sometimes.  Just blam.  Me and you'll probably drive exactly the same.  So one day this dude came to me and brought the windows down.  This motherfucker, he had the same truck I had, the rims and the this and that and the  third.  This motherfucker was like, yo, man, what the fuck?  I go, look, man, it wasn't personal.  This ain't no road rage situation.  It is business.  I didn't pick you out to say you're weaker than me.  I just cut off what I could.  Wow.  Wait a minute.  You fucking killed him with logic.  And the motherfucker went like this. 
[03:20:00]  All right, yo.  Because he didn't want to do that.  No.  But if I had to say, yo, nigga, I did what I did, then it's like, it's a respect thing  and one of us could die over fucking respect.  I would, you, you, that happens on the road all the time.  I was dealing with a truck a while back.  Like, I want it, I want it in front of this truck so fucking bad because I hate being behind  trucks in Manhattan.  Right.  They take forever to take off from lights.  You can't get around and maneuver. 
[03:20:30]  They're constantly getting cut off by the cab.  So if you're behind a truck, you're going 10 times slower than if you weren't behind  them.  So I'm doing all these moves.  I finally find a spot and believe me, I fit in it.  Right.  I'm not cutting him off per se.  Right.  I'm not like making it where he's got to really make a move, but I pull in front of  him.  Right.  So up the line a little ways, I get stuck at a fucking light and he pulls up next to me  and rolls his window down and gives me shit.  I got a fucking truck here and you're, you're cutting me off.  And I pulled the same thing.  It was like, I wasn't cutting you off. 
[03:21:00]  I go, I'm trying to get out of the city just like you are.  Right.  I go, I really, it's not you.  It's the truck.  I go, I just don't want to be behind your truck because it moves a lot slower than I'm going  to go.  Your wife could have been driving.  Yeah.  I'm cutting her off.  And I told her, I go, you watch when this light turns green, you're never going to see  me again.  And he was cool.  He was totally cool.  He goes, he goes, all right, man.  I, he goes, I got you.  It's cool.  All right.  Listen, we got the new name for Reapens.  We got Sarge from Baltimore.  Camp drivers, though, will never get sympathy from me. 
[03:21:30]  They'll always, I would yell savage out the window every time when they get in an argument  with me.  Sarge.  Hey, Opie, look, y'all got me enthralled today.  You want to know what Sherm's was?  Sherm's are loose cigarettes dipped in embalming fluid.  Now there's a derivative called Love Boat specialized in D.C. where that's marijuana spraying with  embalming fluid.  And it gets you fucked up.  Fucked up to the point where you will stand in front of a car, jump off a bridge or out  a window.  You have any maud? 
[03:22:00]  Yeah, embalming fluid.  Look, weed is dro now.  Dro.  You get dro, that's hydro weed.  They grow it underwater.  That's your street tactics for the day.  Thank you very much.  Dro?  It's called dro?  I've heard of hydro.  Yeah, hydro.  Yeah.  Hydro's not a new, though.  Are you from the D.C., Baltimore area?  Yeah, I'm from Baltimore City.  Is that close to D.C. at all?  Yeah, we're 40 miles away from D.C., but D.C. and Baltimore, we always go against it.  I'm from where they make the wire and the block and all that craziness. 
[03:22:30]  At Baltimore, we real fucked up in Baltimore, but they real fucked up in D.C. too.  You know what?  When we take the train to Washington every once in a while and they go through the projects  of Baltimore where they're all boarded up, what is that about?  And then you see some guy's car is parked down in front of one of these.  Yeah, there's one person living in this neighborhood where the ten buildings around him are boarded  up or on fire.  And that's the part of Baltimore I couldn't go to.  Yeah, in the words, look, in the words of Chris Rock, that's Martin Luther King Boulevard. 
[03:23:00]  Run!  The Martin Luther King name is fucked up.  That's Martin Luther King.  There's going to be some violence happening here.  There's no nice Martin Luther King book.  Oh, dude, I grew up in the train doors open.  You're like, oh, my God, why'd you do that?  Why'd you do that?  I grew up in the projects, but I used to, like, it was, it wasn't fun.  What was it?  It was the Good Times Project?  It was the projects, but there wasn't any real shit going on?  No one got shot when I grew up, dude.  No one got shot?  No one got killed.  We used to be able to fight when I was young. 
[03:23:30]  Yeah.  You can't, no kids fight anymore.  No kids grow up.  It's dangerous shit.  Step on someone's foot and look at them the wrong way.  Like, a 13-year-old, like, if a 13-year-old fucking does something, man, you got to talk  to him, like, with this respect thing.  Like, you have to be a mentor.  He has to respect you in some weird, like, he's, you're my dad kind of way.  He got to be cool and respect you, but you can't go out there talking about, yo, motherfucker,  what the fuck is, because he got a brother somewhere that'll murder you, man.  Yeah, I stepped on your foot. 
[03:24:00]  That'll murder you, man.  Yo, what's up, partner?  There's nobody, why do you want to have to deal with murder?  That's nothing worse than that one.  There's nobody that would murder you.  That is nuts.  I love that, and menace to society.  Yeah.  Hey, what's up, partner?  When that guy came over, because the one guy had sex with his cousin and gets up pregnant  and says, nah, it wasn't mine, and someone else, he comes over, what's up, partner?  And they beat the shit out of him, and he came back.  And if you fuck around East Coast, if you fuck around in L.A., you'll get killed for looking  the wrong way.  You'll get killed for being, you cannot, you think this shit's from the movies, you cannot 
[03:24:30]  fucking wear certain colors in L.A.  When I go to L.A. and I rent a car, if they have a red car or a blue car, I can't rent  it.  Holy shit.  I have to rent a white car or a gray car.  I don't fuck around.  I wear green or I wear orange.  Is there any other bad colors?  We all know the red and the blue.  It's the red and the blue.  Red and the blue is all that matters out there.  It was pink for a second here, but.  It's going to get fucked in the ass. 
[03:25:00]  Don't wear red or blue.  What was up with the pink?  And don't do fingery shit.  Don't do shit.  Don't go, what's up?  Peace sign.  What if you sign into some deaf person?  Nigga, you might get killed.  That's for real.  Motherfuckers throwing up gangsters.  Somebody did a joke like that, but you could get killed doing the wrong L.A.  And here's the difference between L.A. and New York.  I was just trying to say hi to Kathy Buckley.  Driving down Carenshaw.  This is the difference between L.A. and New York.  And she's a comic and you would say hi.  New York.  It made me.  Kathy Buckley. 
[03:25:30]  You know what?  Wait a minute.  Oh, don't.  Kathy Buckley hasn't been known since Arsenio Hall's first season.  That's what makes it so good.  That is 89.  I like the obscure thing.  All right, how about.  Thank you.  Yeah.  In Chicago, I was just saying hi to Karen Meyer.  Karen Meyer.  There you go.  There's nobody deaf famous.  There's nobody famous either.  Famous deaf people.  Who's famous deaf people?  Where are the deaf famous people?  Some of my jokes are funny.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, you got to watch what color you wear.  Jesus, L.A. ain't fucking around, dude.  Here's something for Patrice. 
[03:26:00]  Mike in Jersey.  Mike.  Yo.  Yeah, they call weed kush now.  Kush?  Kush?  Yeah, kush.  Like, the real good shit is called kush.  Man, they got so many terms.  And any time somebody says something to you that you don't know, this is just so you know.  It's a little lesson.  Any time you're somewhere you're not supposed to be, and somebody says something to you that  ain't supposed to be saying something to you, all you do is go, nah, I'm good.  Nah, I'm good.  Because they're selling you drugs.  Yeah.  Any talk that they don't know what the fuck, they're not asking you how's your day, or 
[03:26:30]  hey, you look great, where'd you go get your tan, or anything.  They're trying to sell you drugs, and you go, nah, I'm good.  I always assume it's just a preface to a mugging.  Like, any time, I don't look people in the eye in the city.  Show them how you answer it.  And I, so here's how I, because usually it is a preface to a mugging, because it's like,  yo, you got the time, or something like that.  And I just go, I don't know what the hell is going on with anything in the, like, and  I keep walking, throwing my arms up, and just kind of yelling, and I, I just go, I don't 
[03:27:00]  even know what the hell.  And I keep walking, and I get, like, in the road more.  You was just born in a suburban cul-de-sac.  That's me.  I don't make eye contact.  I don't make eye contact.  Like, I see a group of young brothers walking down the street, I will not make eye contact  with anyone, not peripherally, not anything.  I'll know they're there.  It's like how Michael Corleone was supposed to drop the gun.  Right.  Like, I don't look them right in the eye, but I know exactly what they're up to at 
[03:27:30]  every given moment.  And don't be a victim.  Don't be like, oh boy.  No, no, no.  The other day, me and my girl walking down the sidewalk, we're going to eat somewhere,  and there's a black guy walking behind us.  Now, I don't know him from a hole in the wall.  Guy could be a Wall Street executive.  Don't, I don't know, because I can't see him.  I don't want to turn around and look and assess him either.  So what I do, I cross the street.  I just cross the street.  I went, boop, cross the street. 
[03:28:00]  Worry about it later, because I ain't going to be a fucking victim.  Well, this is the thing I used to do.  One of my major bits back in the day was-  Hysterical, the skinheads.  Listen, don't let guilt-  Because this-  I firmly believe this country is falling apart because of white guilt.  Because the people in charge are starting to feel guilty, but they're still in charge.  And they're not doing the right thing.  You know what I'm saying?  So it's like a white guy will get his ass beat by a black dude who's sitting there going,  you know, this is, you know, like put it this way. 
[03:28:30]  You ever see Crash and it's like, motherfucker, I ain't trying to rob you.  Yeah, yeah.  And it's like, oh, I'm sorry.  You know, and it's like, yes, I am, nigga.  I just didn't want to chase you.  So it's like, give me your money, nigga.  That was a good one.  I played you with your own white guilt.  And I'm like, look, man, if I'm walking in Kentucky and I see five bald white dudes walking  in Kentucky, I ain't going to wonder if they all got cancer.  I'm running.  Yeah.  I'm like, nigga.  I'm like, I don't give a fuck if they was like, wait, can you get our medicine?  Because we're too weak to go to the store ourselves. 
[03:29:00]  Fuck you, cancer KKK.  The old cancer hang a nigga trick.  I haven't done that joke in so long, but it's like, nigga, I'm not going to die from my-  It's like when you walk through the mall and somebody goes, can I talk to you for a minute?  And you go, you're too weak to go, no.  I do.  How about at Marshall's?  Can I have your phone number?  No.  I say no.  Keep typing.  Keep doing it.  I don't want a relationship with you.  Go ahead.  No.  And they get mad.  They get this huffy thing.  I say no all the time to all that crap. 
[03:29:30]  No.  I don't need this to buy something?  No.  Let's go.  Sean in the Bronx has something.  Sean.  Yeah, I'm a fireman in the city.  I wanted to ask Patrice.  The Projects.  You've got Escalades all around.  You've got the rims, the whole nine yards.  You go up in there.  There's piss and shit all over the elevators.  Then you get inside the apartment.  It looks like shit, but they've got the best electronics and everything else you can imagine.  Why would Patrice know this?  I love how they ask you a question like, how come there's Escalades?  Well, let me pull out my chart of districts. 
[03:30:00]  Here's the question.  How do I always have nice shit, but live in the Projects?  Because you can afford to have nice shit when you live in the Projects.  Before I bought a house, my rent was $4.92.  It's simple economics.  If you walk into my bedroom, I had a 47-inch computer monitor.  You see this, Seattle?  Here's what I used to do when I had a roommate.  I threw away T-shirts.  When I wear it, I throw it away. 
[03:30:30]  One time?  One time, I would wear it and throw it in the garbage.  Now, ever since I've come into White World, I wash them.  Welcome to White World.  I clean my sneakers.  I used to get my jeans dry clean all the time.  So if you have an Escalade.  Because every month is a mortgage bill.  Here's what you can do.  This defilement.  What you can do is you have your Escalade.  You pick your bitch up.  Right?  A bitch you just fucking, you don't need to take him to the house.  You know what I'm saying? 
[03:31:00]  So you take him to the hotel because you can afford it.  Because you don't pay that much rent at the projects.  And you go home and you play your video games.  Your boys come over because they all live in the same building.  Y'all smoke weed.  And in the projects, a nigga can have a house by himself.  Like a 17-year-old kid can pay the rent in the projects.  So he has a 72-inch TV.  He has a fucking stainless steel refrigerator.  He has a pit bull.  And he has his Escalade.  He takes bitches to the hotel to fuck him.  And he sleeps. 
[03:31:30]  And that's why it's such a nice thing.  But when you go into white world, you learn what Leeson is.  You learn what Fannie Mae is.  You learn what Blasey this is.  Interest racing.  Freddie Mac.  You know what it is.  You know what the fuck it is.  And your mindset changes.  That's why you go into bricks and see some really nice shit.  But you're like, why is there piss everywhere?  Because you know what?  His is inside my house.  You never...  Let me tell you when it changed.  When that shit changed.  When they start putting roofs on the projects. 
[03:32:00]  When they start putting pointy roofs instead of making them...  It makes people feel like it's their home.  The projects don't feel like your home.  So you go like, fuck this elevator.  I'm pissing it.  But you go in your particular little area and it's kind of nice.  Yeah.  Or whatever.  Or the landlord.  You're not responsible for anything.  It's not...  It's what they call burden of ownership.  There's no burden of ownership.  It's like, nigga, don't sit...  Nigga, don't put your feet on my couch.  That's your shit.  Don't put your fingers on my TV.  That's your shit. 
[03:32:30]  But you know what?  Piss on the floor because it ain't my shit.  Piss in the elevator.  Shit in the stairwell.  When you get in my truck...  Motherfucker.  I'm sorry.  You ever see...  I watch people...  White women, for some reason, decide they take their shoes off and they put their feet  on the dashboard of a car.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just do that in a nigga's car.  Like, bitches, your empty, stinking-ass foot on my dashboard of my Escalade...  Get your ashy feet off my fucking...  It's a priority thing, man.  It's like, but you can't judge us.  Don't judge us.  It's just like...  It took me a few years to start white whirling it up. 
[03:33:00]  When bill collectors used to call me, I would go, who's this?  Well, you owe...  Hey, why don't you suck my dick?  Holy shit.  What are you going to do to me, fuckface?  I owe you 5Gs.  I'll owe it...  And he goes, well, we'll take money out your account.  Why don't you suck my dick and take it?  I know you can't take it, because you know why?  You didn't do it yet.  Go fuck yourself.  So, ever since I tried to get a house... 
[03:33:30]  Yeah.  And bill collectors called me, I get nervous, because I don't want to fuck up that 780.  You got a nice credit rating.  I got a nice credit rating.  A 780, you're very nice.  I said, nigga, what do you need, sir?  I get real slave-y.  Lord, NASA, NASA, I just don't want to...  I want to stay in the house.  I, AT&T, I just want to dispute it, but I just can't.  All right, we got to take a break.  I just want to dispute it. 
[03:34:00]  I just want to dispute it, sir, but I just can't.  We got to take a break.  We've been at this for an hour and a half straight.  This is just amazing radio.  The education we get.  We got Dane Cook calling in in a few minutes.  Damn.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  We'll continue in just a bit here.  Huzzah!  I got to cast the spell on you.  I'll run ye through.  Four damage.  You're not even double dual wielding.  Plastic sword.  Two damage.  Two damage. 
[03:34:30]  I cast the spell.  Grab with my beanbag.  I just cast the spell.  You've slowed me.  Now I cannot hit you as quickly.  Four damage.  Four damage.  Two damage.  Two damage.  Ooh, my arm.  I wish you were dead.  Do ye?  Don't be an Anthony!  All right, let's go, skunk boy. 
[03:35:00]  Skunk boy.  I'm going to fucking put a foot right through that shit.  Skunk boy.  Yeah.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  Hey, I just wanted to beg you guys.  Please, you've got to do the country top ten.  I think Patrice is going to come in soon, so we'll have to do that next time. 
[03:35:30]  We got Dane Cooks calling back.  We need a solid hour to do that country music.  Yeah, it takes a while.  All right, guys.  Thanks a lot.  Punch it out.  Sorry.  We were going to do it today, but we went off on an hour and a half tangent.  Which is fine.  Necrology.  You should teach a course, man.  I'm going to fucking, I'm going to teach a course and kick in the fucking Anthony's  goddamn back headlights out.  No.  I'm going to baseball bat his car.  What's the problem?  I was talking about the car.  I'm so disgusted with your cash, you motherfuckers. 
[03:36:00]  And can't get me a goddamn Panasonic?  We're working on it.  We're going to work on that.  Shit.  We weren't kidding.  Get you a Panasonic?  That hurts me.  That's more money I got in the band.  That hurt my feelings.  Well, it's everything's relative.  You know?  Ah, shut the fuck up.  That's what I say to the milkman, nigga.  We're both in show business.  He's not buying a thousand dollar Sonics, I don't know, whatever.  Yeah.  See?  And what I've saved over the years.  Yeah, look.  You're looking like a hook of shit.  You could...  Right.  Exactly.  Look, we don't have to look nice in the morning. 
[03:36:30]  So we'll see old shit every day.  You better have at least high eight figures.  This guy, forget it.  He's got his communion money.  All you have to do is plunk down $17.95 for rollerblades cash, and that's it.  I know.  You son of a bitch.  Yeah, I'm spending really into material things.  Nah.  Fuck.  You've got the same vehicle you've had for a while now, right?  You want to know what's really sad?  I couldn't tell you how much money I make right now. 
[03:37:00]  It's not important to me.  It's got to be...  It's not important to a point.  $30,000, $40,000 a year.  Every once in a while, I've got to ask Ant.  We more than that.  Ant knows.  I don't know.  You're fucking right, Ant knows, because of what he did.  Oh, don't drive at the...  Oh, no, I knew before that.  Do not drive that car anywhere near me.  I'm going to do a header right through the windshield.  I knew before that.  I keep tabs.  Because obviously, I know I do very, very well, but an actual figure...  I asked Ant like about three or four months ago.  I was like, are you kidding?  Really?  I was like surprised.  I make sure...  Like, I get... 
[03:37:30]  Do you...  I call our agent up,  and I get statements from him.  Yeah, that's right.  And I get all the codes to all the bank accounts,  so I know I can look in and check balances  and see where things went.  Yeah, to make sure he's not ripping us off.  This is very interesting.  And like...  This is very interesting.  Do you do that?  As fucking Eric Logan wouldn't give me $17.95 to do a show on his fucking channel.  Eric.  $17.95 I asked for.  Elo.  He offered me $10.  I asked for $17.  All right.  No.  Elo's not going to hide.  He'll call.  Son of a bitch.  I heard a different story myself. 
[03:38:00]  Yeah, of course you did.  Of course.  Of course.  Of fucking course he did.  I heard your agent priced you out.  No, he didn't.  Oh, boy.  Because I know agents don't price you out.  You price yourself out  because they don't make up a price that you don't agree with.  Yes.  I priced myself out.  Did I really, Eric?  Well, we'll see.  He'll call us.  When this motherfucker just told me a story  that has me hunting his car,  I'm stalking your car now.  Don't touch his car.  That thing stays in the garage.  I only drive in Long Island.  I only drive it on Long Island. 
[03:38:30]  I'm on a special road they built for me yesterday.  You fuck.  I'm going to take a shit right on the racetrack.  The thing will never cross into New York City limits, man.  All right, listen, listen.  You'll never drive that in New York?  I will never drive that in New York.  We got Dane Cook on the line.  He's very busy today.  He's calling to say hi.  Dane.  What's up, Dane?  Is that Dane Cook?  Is that Patrice?  Yeah.  Is that Dane?  What is Patrice pontificating about?  Is this tourgasm Dane?  Is this 40,000?  What white person has stepped on Patrice's toes this week?  We're learning a lot. 
[03:39:00]  First of all, Dane, don't you call in with this  I'm almost famous fucking positivity from L.A., fuckface.  Don't forget, we started out together hating the world, bitch-ass nigga.  Now you smoke love joints with everybody,  and there's rumors about you on page six, canoodling.  All of a sudden, I'm angry Negro.  Fuck you, my fuck.  All of a sudden?  Well, yeah, that's true.  At least I stay consistent. 
[03:39:30]  I think you've been angry ever since you stepped on that stage for the first time.  I'm a nigga from Boston.  You know I got...  You weren't doing Gilligan's Island jokes up there.  I had to call Dane one day and tell him, though, he's changing the game.  Dane changed the fucking game, man.  Anybody...  I spent a lot of time defending this motherfucker,  because people go,  Dane,  I go, do you know this motherfucker's famous,  and no one knows him?  This nigga...  This nigga won an Oscar,  and he wasn't even in a movie.  Dane is bigger than the business. 
[03:40:00]  You know what I'm saying?  It's like...  It's like you can't wish...  He making it despite Hollywood.  You can't...  Yeah, it was very...  What do they call that?  Grassroots.  He fucking rules the world.  How can you fucking say you can't?  And now he's in movies.  Throwing him in movies.  I even went to rehab,  and I've never done a drug in my life.  Just for publicity.  Well, Dane, in New York,  they're saying that you were canoodling with Jessica Simpson.  That's popping up again.  I know.  We did. 
[03:40:30]  We fucking hung out at the party and canoodled.  Yeah, it was in the paper.  It said you were canoodling,  but then I know canoodling is like kissing and snuggling,  and it said you just were whispering in each other's ears all night,  and whenever, like, she would go somewhere,  you would be following behind her kind of,  and you'd hook up again,  and a lot of whispering, whispering.  First of all, you're whispering because, you know,  they're playing the music so loud.  That's what I said.  See?  That's it.  So, and no, we sat in one little VIP section.  We hadn't seen each other in like two months. 
[03:41:00]  So we were just talking about the movie and all that,  and then we both left.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Let's clear this up, Dane.  They're both in New York promoting Employee of the Month,  and of course they're going to be hanging together.  Let's clear this up, Dane.  And you wasn't whispering to her where y'all was going to snort coke and fuck.  Yeah, Patrice, that's exactly.  All right, I'm just making sure that's not,  I'm making, because that's where my fucking heart would be,  you know, coke and fucking.  So it was just about the movie.  Life was going good.  We were just making sure.  I'm making sure my friend Dane ain't out there doing crazy shit.  I'm doing that new strawberry quick cocaine too. 
[03:41:30]  Strawberry quick.  Hey, how's the dog, man?  He's good, man.  He's doing all right.  The Beast is good.  Yeah, he's still good.  I love his dog.  Dane got like a small Doberman.  I love that dog.  Yeah?  Yeah.  He got like the miniature Dobermans,  but they're like chihuahuas,  but they're not as crack, you know, weird.  Yeah, he's laid back.  They don't look like they're on crack.  It's like a little dog,  but what a big dog,  like big dog confidence.  Attitude, yeah.  I hate those little yappy, shaking dogs.  Yeah, I love that dog, man. 
[03:42:00]  And now here's what I asked Patrice.  Now, that was a nice question about my dog.  How are your glass dildos?  Well, you know,  everyone knows about your glass dildos.  We were talking about his sex swing  that's hanging from his garage.  It's in his garage now  because he doesn't want to stank up his house.  With a rug and everything.  I got an area rug in the middle.  Nice.  I haven't talked to Patrice in a long time.  I need to just sit in a room  and listen to you tell me everything  for like three days straight  without saying the words.  You got to get updated on his life  because he has more whiteness 
[03:42:30]  in his life these days.  Oh, yeah.  It's the whitification of Patrice.  There's only a few things in this world  that I really miss  and that's commiserating with Patrice O'Neal  about what the hell he's getting himself into.  Always wondering.  Because everybody always wonders  like why...  Patrice, why aren't you...  That'll be always the question.  Tell Dana about your girlfriend.  She's gaining weight.  My girl's getting...  Oh, yeah.  You don't want to know about that.  Why not?  Fucking Jessica Simpson.  What do you know about my fat girlfriend?  Noodling with Jessica. 
[03:43:00]  Well, we learned that today.  She's worried that she's getting fat  and you said you would leave her.  But that's absolutely...  If your girlfriend...  If your hot girlfriend, Dane,  started getting fat  and she said,  are you going to leave me?  What would your fucking answer be?  I'd be like,  listen, let's talk about this  on the treadmill.  See, now that's a great...  Wow, that's a good answer.  And he would do it with her to me.  I'm like, look,  I'm going to stay fat,  but my fatness  has nothing to do with you, bitch.  My coolness is something else. 
[03:43:30]  Yours is to look...  You are to try to make a fat man  look like he's better  because he has a gorgeous girlfriend.  Now, you can't do that  being fat now, can you?  Okay?  Pork chop.  God damn pork chop.  Patrice, where are you living now?  I live in the same area I lived in  except for I, like,  own where I live now.  He's a homeowner.  And now, are you...  Is VH1 taking care?  Do you get a house now?  Do you get some money?  No, VH1 didn't give me house money.  VH1 might have gave me house money. 
[03:44:00]  I think a couple of colleges there.  Yeah.  The virus tour gave me a couple of...  There you go.  A couple of new shoes.  Just shoes.  That was good.  Some shoes and a couple of DVDs.  That's all we got, yeah?  I'll tell you,  the virus tour justified  a couple of things in my life.  You motherfucking...  Justified.  You pieces of shit  with your money.  Yeah, you know, that car...  God damn it!  That car was one tour stop.  Now they're doing the...  No.  Dane, are you endorsing 
[03:44:30]  the spinoff Tourgasm Tour with...  I am producing the Tourgasm Tour, yes.  Are you going to surprise visit some...  Yeah, you should surprise visit.  I hope to.  Yeah, now that I'm done with this stuff,  I can probably jump out  to a couple of these gigs.  It's franchising like Starbucks.  It's amazing.  It's fucking...  I turned around.  I know Dane.  Yeah.  I turned around.  I go,  is Dane famous?  That's what I would ask people.  What happened?  Like, is Dane famous?  I know him.  I have his number.  Is this motherfucking... 
[03:45:00]  Is he a household word right now?  People seem to be talking about him.  I turned around  and there's a finger  that's his super finger,  Sufi,  that's a conglomerate.  It's more money than Viacom.  And I'm like,  when did this happen?  At what set at the Laugh Factory  on fucking Sunset Boulevard  did this fucking happen?  The minute I stepped away  from the table at the cellar.  That is really...  Oh, shit.  That really is.  And here's the sad thing.  That's inside,  but really good. 
[03:45:30]  There's a lot of bitterness  at that back table.  It's just when...  I'm going to tell you  where a lot of this comes from.  And it's not from...  Because from Tough Cry,  when Tough Cry was on,  it was me,  Norton,  Nick,  Colin,  and we kind of got...  And Voss.  Yeah.  He made sure not to forget Voss  because that's really...  You can feel it.  And Voss.  Voss.  But we used to sit around  and just like,  you stink, you loser,  you this, you that.  And a lot of comics  are not privy to that shit.  Like, they don't like  that whole loser, 
[03:46:00]  you suck,  you ain't shit.  So it's like,  let me get away from that  and get into some  positive thinking.  But here's the thing.  That's what Dane is,  is positive thinking.  Some of the guys  that try to subscribe  to Dane Cookology  are losing.  Like Fat Boy.  Like Bobby Kelly  who's starting to look like  Emeril Lagasse.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Who has to understand  he's a fucking loser.  He is not to hang out  with positive vibes.  He's to be with losers 
[03:46:30]  and stay with losers  and he'll find success.  No one wants to be around  this fat balding man  who has this evil look  in his eyes.  These black eyes.  Lifeless eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  Like a doll's eyes.  You made one mistake.  You said balding.  He's actually bald.  And I'm telling you Dane.  No more A's.  Dane has a lot of guys.  It's the side of,  it's the dark side  and it's the light.  Now, Dane is succeeding  on the force. 
[03:47:00]  The light side of the force.  But there's a lot of guys  who think they should be  living on the force side.  Right.  Who aren't living on it.  Like Gary is an angry man.  Gary Goldman.  Yeah.  Because he should be  on the force side  and it should be,  his life should be cultivated.  But he's mean and mad.  And if he accepts that  he could be a Sith Lord.  If he accepts his evil  he will be fantastic.  Dane is nice.  Dane's playing the garden. 
[03:47:30]  Of course he is.  Dane's playing the garden.  It's probably on the way  to something else.  He's dropping through  at the garden.  Dropping in, yeah.  It's like, you know what?  Dane's MySpace sin button  is like,  I can't get ready  to launch a missile?  Like it's like,  all right Dane,  are you sure you want to do  Ohio State University?  Yes.  Pop!  You sure you want to do  the state of Kansas?  Dane Cook is performing  tonight, one night only. 
[03:48:00]  Dane performs  in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Where at?  In Minneapolis.  Where?  Nigga!  Minneapolis!  He puts out a bulletin  onto MySpace,  hits send,  and all the lights dim.  Like all the power.  That's why MySpace  crashed.  From the internet,  it's getting soaked up.  You're like,  oh, Dane must be  putting out a bulletin.  Me and my 1700 friends.  Oh, shit.  Dane's friends  can gang rape my friends.  Oh.  And they couldn't  fight it off. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, that's funny.  Because they got involved  with the MySpace  way too late.  They saw what it did  for Dane.  Yeah, Dane got in  like really early.  You gotta be in early.  Dane, who fucking  told you about that?  Don't even tell me  that you were sitting  there going,  hmm, this looks like  a good place for me to,  I was on Friendster  and a fan wrote me  and was like,  dude, doesn't this suck?  And I was like,  yeah.  And he goes,  you should check this out.  So I skipped over  to MySpace early on.  Do you owe that guy  money now?  I don't know who that is, man.  That son of a bitch. 
[03:49:00]  I jumped over there.  Man, he gave you  a great tip.  You know the guy Tom,  though, right?  The guy that runs it, right?  Yeah, those guys.  I mean, they need to  God, I know that, yeah.  Yeah, he's worth  like $580 million  or something.  Unbelievable.  Dane is slacking, though.  He only has  1.5 million friends.  Oh, that's it.  What's with that, nigga?  What's with that, Dane?  There are countries  that don't have  those populations.  Dane has India  as a friend.  Dane's like a country now.  Dane has Tibet.  As his friends.  Welcome to Dane.  Ha, ha, ha.  Come to Dane. 
[03:49:30]  You got a passport?  That doesn't...  You can't get into Dane  with it.  To Dane?  Unbelievable.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Dane Cook.  Ladies and gentlemen,  I will soon be  arriving in Dane.  The weather is perfect,  of course,  as it is every day.  So fasten your seatbelts  and prepare for landing  and enjoy your time  in Dane.  Patrice O'Neal,  you coined it, man.  You said the thing,  though,  at the back of Nick's  one day  when everybody was  trying to be  something they weren't  on stage.  I remember you  looked at me, dude,  and you go,  I'll tell you, man,  the thing that's 
[03:50:00]  going to make you  make it.  He goes,  you can't fuck  with the truth.  And that's all  I ever did, man.  I was like,  all right, fuck it.  I'll just be myself.  I'm not going to  try to bust balls  if I don't want  to bust balls.  And really,  Patrice is one of the guys  that actually was,  you know,  he got me.  He got me right away.  So a lot of comics  try to be something  they're not.  A lot of comics,  you think?  That's why I tell,  I tell,  that's why I tell,  I know how to make  Bobby Kelly famous.  He's,  see,  Dane's fame is  different than  Bobby's fame.  He's not. 
[03:50:30]  Like,  certain people have  certain kind of fame,  man.  I could never be  Dane famous.  I would do,  my personality  would do something  to horrifically  fuck up my fan base.  Like,  I would just tell him,  go fuck yourself  with your goddamn finger.  Stick these two  sufis up,  you fucking cunt whore.  Get out of my,  you know what?  I'm tired of the  Madison Square Garden.  It'll be 13,000 people  going,  what?  He's having a nervous  breakdown.  Hey,  get him out of here.  Go suck a dick. 
[03:51:00]  I know where  my bread's buttered.  My bread is not buttered.  I might make a million  somehow.  Throwing out a heckler  in like section 304.  But Dane,  the thing I tell Dane,  because a lot of  old school guys  hate Dane.  Old school motherfuckers  hate Dane.  And I'll go,  look,  let me tell you something,  man.  This motherfucker,  and I say this,  and this is not  no bullshit,  man.  You know me,  man.  No.  He's righteous.  I say to motherfucker,  we had a long talk.  It's one of these 
[03:51:30]  long,  long time ago.  Last long talk we had,  and Dane did two things.  Well,  I remember I said,  Dane,  look,  man,  because he told me  all this heavy shit  about himself.  I said,  you don't talk about  this shit on stage.  He goes,  I have no interest  in it.  Maybe in a movie,  maybe,  but I would never  talk about that  deep down hurting  shit on stage.  I went,  fair enough.  And then he proceeded  to go,  you know,  I'm tired of people  stealing from me  and Jim Carrey.  And that's when I wish  it was somebody else  there for me to look at  and go,  what? 
[03:52:00]  That conversation,  that was the last  heart to heart  we like had,  but that's why I go,  that motherfucker's  righteous.  Whatever he's doing,  it's him.  Don't do fucking  somebody else.  Right.  Bobby Kelly.  I love Bobby.  I tell him this  all the time.  You're not a guy  people love.  So what do you,  what is the adjustment  that Bobby needs to make  then?  He needs to stop  talking about  butter cookies  and cheese whiz  on stage  because Bobby  is a deviant 
[03:52:30]  problem person,  but he can't  deal with no  laughter.  Bobby needs  the laughs  that Dane get.  Bobby needs  that,  but Bobby  needs to learn  how to not  be funny  for a second  so that he can  deep,  deep,  go deep down  into what the  fuck problems  he has  as an ex  good looking  guy.  Like,  oh man,  I was watching  Torgasm  the other day  and I saw  the episode  where you guys  look back  and holy shit 
[03:53:00]  there was some  videos,  some old videos  of Bobby  with that  jerry curl  motherfucking  hair or whatever  the hell that was.  Bobby was sexy,  man.  Rico Suave.  He was Rico Suave.  He was like a  young Marlon Brando.  He was fucking  sexy.  Bobby was  tremendously sexy.  Sexy Bobby.  He really,  you should see  his old head  shot at the  cellar.  You go,  holy mother.  What a pretty  man.  He is P.  Bobby was  pretty.  He was like  a male  Angelina.  I used to 
[03:53:30]  bring girls,  this was my  litmus test,  I used to  bring girls  that I liked  down to  Remington's  or the  vault or  whatever,  and then  they would  meet Bobby  and then  Bobby would  go fuck  my chick.  And that's  what I knew  that I wasn't  with the  right girl.  He still  has that  charm,  but Bobby  lost a little  bit of the  charm,  because Bobby's  on a mission  of positivity  now.  And he's  losing.  Dude,  you know,  life is like a  box of onion  rings,  you know.  When he came in 
[03:54:00]  the first few  times,  he would talk  about how  deviant a  lifestyle he was  leading,  and then he'd  start talking  about,  I'm talking to  people and I  just want to get  a little more  positivity in my  life.  He's trying to  figure it out.  What Dane does  is what he  does.  What I do,  I try,  let me tell you  something,  everybody tries to  be Dane at  one point,  they try  positivity.  I tried  positivity in  98,  it almost  killed me.  I liked it.  I was in  there.  Yeah,  hello everyone, 
[03:54:30]  what do you  need?  I love your  t-shirt.  I was in a  room by myself  with two  Whoppers sitting  on my stomach  because that's  all I could  afford to eat.  And I said,  if I had a gun,  I'd blow my  fucking brains  out because I'm  in here skipping  around and like  Jamie Masada  that owns the  Laugh Factory,  he come by D  with his dry  skin and talking  to you.  And I'm going,  hey Mr.  Hey,  how are you,  man?  Good to see you,  you creepy  Iranian.  It's like,  nah,  it's like my  thing is to go,  get the fuck  out of my face. 
[03:55:00]  It's like,  I would never  hang with you.  But people,  people think that  you say that  Patrice because  you're afraid of  success and that's  why you take that  route.  I used to be.  I fucking was  that person that  like goes,  oh man,  I'm tired of this.  You know what,  I'm afraid of.  No.  Getting a little  too close.  Yeah,  I want it.  But also at the  same time,  I know me.  The success that  I want is the  one that gets to  say to somebody,  yeah,  look,  this is dumb. 
[03:55:30]  Yeah,  I mean,  because things  out of the  stand-up world,  you have to be  collaborative and  that means fucking  putting on business  hat for more hours  of the day than  the fuck off hat.  And so that's the  thing,  Patrice.  I don't think a lot  of people think  that you can do  that.  I probably,  he's getting better  at it.  I've seen it even  in the short term.  This daffy bastard  has gotten himself  a good credit rating.  He's bought a house.  This is shit  that years ago,  years ago, 
[03:56:00]  and he's talking  about things like,  he's talking about  things like,  like sitting in a  room at a closing  and,  you know,  I call it the  whitification of  Patrice.  It's a little,  you know,  he's just entering  a whole new world.  Let me tell you  something,  that credit rating,  that's like sitting  at the blackjack  table.  You don't want  to lose that shit.  No,  that,  your life hinges  on it at some  point if you reach  a certain level  of success  where you're out  of the rented  house,  out of your  friends coming  over in the  rented house,  trashing it with 
[03:56:30]  beer cans and  stuff.  When you move  up to actually  buy a house,  things like credit  ratings come into  play and you're  like,  ugh.  But look at you  guys though.  What you were  before,  like you take  less L's than  you used to  take before.  Like before  the fucking  chapel shit,  you motherfuckers  would,  you know,  have somebody  fuck a horse  in Times Square  and be like,  you get threatened  to be fired,  you'd be laughing.  But now you  can see you  motherfuckers go, 
[03:57:00]  oh lordy,  you get slaving.  Lordy,  lordy,  lordy,  we don't want  news.  The master  says those  words ain't  supposed to be  used.  But nice is  not my basis  for why I'm  funny.  Ever.  In my life.  Yeah.  And you know  that.  It's been pain.  And I can't,  I just can't figure  out how to be  funny without pain.  So I have to  make it.  So that's  nothing wrong  with that.  No, it works.  But it works  for someone  and I know  it works for me.  And how's  Billy Bird  doing after  that YouTube 
[03:57:30]  thing that I  watched?  They don't  know,  they won't  call.  I would  love to  talk to  Billy.  I don't  know.  You know  his number?  I don't  have his  number.  My cell  phone is  broken.  And you  know something?  Billy Bird  never gave  me his  phone number  and I  never gave  Billy my  phone  number.  I don't  know what  has your  phone number.  You don't  have my  phone  number?  I don't  have Patrice's  phone number.  She calls  you here.  I got  Opie's  phone number.  That's who  I have in  my contacts.  I'm going  to call him  today.  Are you  calling?  It's only  been two  weeks.  You better  call him,  man.  I always  say,  the past  couple of 
[03:58:00]  weeks,  I've been  saying,  where's  Billy?  How's  he doing?  Have  you checked  out the  Bill Burr  video yet?  I watched  the whole  thing,  man.  On  YouTube?  It's  unbelievable.  Wow.  Dave,  what are you  playing in  Transformers?  I don't  think I'm  doing it,  man,  because they  wanted to  change my  scene around  and then I  didn't like  the new  scene that  they wrote.  What was  you?  What were  you in  this?  Originally,  I wrote  a scene.  I met  with Michael  Bay and  he told me  to write  a scene.  He's like,  do whatever  you want.  I go,  I'll only  do it if  I can  fight a 
[03:58:30]  fucking  robot.  As  who,  Dane?  No,  here's the  thing.  I was  going to  do a  cameo.  I sat  down with  Michael  Bay.  He goes,  all right,  tell me  what you  want to  do.  I go,  here's  the deal.  I only  want to  do a  cameo if  I can  fight  Optimus  Prime.  He goes,  all right,  you write  the scene.  I wrote  a scene  out where  I'm  driving  down  the  street  in  my  car  and  my  car  starts  fucking  transforming  and my  own  car beats  the shit  out of me  and I  start  fighting  my 
[03:59:00]  throw it  on  somebody's  desk  and be  like,  good  afternoon,  sir.  Oh,  boy.  And I  said,  no,  I don't  think I'm  doing it.  But on  a super  high level.  Yeah,  I do  that when  I'm  supposed to  say yes.  Patrice,  no one  knows who  you are.  No one  will ever  know you  want to  throw  something  on  somebody's  desk.  I  go,  fuck  off.  I'm  not  throwing  something  on  a  desk.  And  then  it's  like,  boy,  I wish  I had  that  $2,000. 
[03:59:30]  And yet  you'll  dress up  like a  transvestite.  I thought,  listen to me,  motherfucker.  Listen,  he just  threw that  for,  see how  positive  people do?  They throw  a hook  and then  back up,  you motherfucker.  Listen to  this,  okay?  If you're  going to  play a  fag,  one,  it's  the lady  that did  the piano.  What's  her name?  Oh,  you ain't  going to  get that  answer  out of  me.  I  should  know  her name.  Holly  Hunter?  No,  the woman 
[04:00:00]  who directed  it.  That woman,  okay,  that lady  makes one  movie every  17 years  and it gets  an Oscar.  It's Mark  Ruffalo,  it's Meg  Ryan,  it's fucking  some artsy  black noir  bullshit.  Right.  And I'm  like,  I'm going to  play a  Dominican  faggot.  All right,  sounds good.  All right.  My career,  nothing.  I tried to  sue to get  out that  movie.  It was,  here's how  unnecessary my  character was.  In the credits,  it said,  it said 
[04:00:30]  Hector.  And then,  in parentheses,  it said what  character I  was.  Oh,  no.  In the  fucking  credits,  Hector,  big nigga in  front of the  thing,  remember him?  That's in the  credits.  Oh,  shit.  But you  would do  that.  Like,  you would  play,  okay,  in an  Adam Sandler  movie,  it's the  difference between  playing a  fag,  in an  Adam Sandler  movie,  you know,  no difference,  because Tracy  played a  sissy in one  of his movies,  but it's the  difference between  playing a fag in  a comedy or 
[04:01:00]  like a  Martin Scorsese's  drama.  You go,  I think I'll play a  gay guy in a  Martin Scorsese movie.  I think that get me  something.  Or retard.  Right.  In a serious movie,  that gets you  something.  Yep.  Who's calling  you?  That's Opie's  ring on his  phone now.  Play that at the  bank,  motherfucker.  Jesus Christ. 
[04:01:30]  I might have to  change that.  I want a good  credit rating.  And good luck,  Chuck.  How fine is  Jessica Alba?  I just need to  know that.  Yeah,  yeah.  Oh,  is she sexy up  close?  That girl is,  she's a goddess.  Is she flirty or  very just straight  towards?  I mean,  yeah,  yeah,  she's really  cool,  man.  She's like,  she's my speed.  That's a girl  right there.  That's,  I mean,  she got a  boyfriend,  but she is,  she is the  real deal.  Does she have  any sexy,  like flirty?  Other than how  good she looks,  is she like,  does she give  you a little  something like 
[04:02:00]  you go,  oh,  you motherfucker,  if you don't  stop?  No,  no,  she's like,  you know,  she's a pro,  man.  She's been in  it a long time  too.  She didn't just  step on,  she has to  show up.  She knows  what the deal,  it's not like  glamorous anymore.  She's like,  all right,  what's up?  What are we  doing?  All right,  later.  Damn.  Yeah,  she was up in  here one day.  Oh,  how sexy is she?  Is she gorgeous?  Really?  She's fantastic  looking,  man.  All right,  let's,  Dane's really  busy.  I know,  busy Dane,  his movie. 
[04:02:30]  Patrice,  what are you  doing next,  dude?  Stand up New  York tonight.  Maybe I can  take my show  and just put it  in yours.  Have your show  babysit my show.  You could be  the babysitting  room at his  Madison Square  Garden show.  You could be  the smoking  section,  a little glass  damn.  I'll tell you  what,  Patrice,  I'm going to  do you a  solid,  I'm going to  put you on  my top eight  for four hours, 
[04:03:00]  so get ready.  Oh,  man.  Get my  8,000 friends.  Oh,  man,  you're going  to get a  lot of  friends.  First  sofa I see  on my page,  I'm getting  them off.  I'm going to  write them a  letter,  go fuck  yourself.  That's what  I love about  Patrice,  his whole  system,  no goals.  Yeah,  it must be  so nice to  go through  life like  that.  How great  is that?  So whatever  happens,  good,  you're surprised  about it.  Somebody  called,  you want to  do what? 
[04:03:30]  Yeah,  no goals.  They called  me for web  junk,  I ain't doing  nothing.  No goals.  No goals.  No goals.  Bridge burner.  Bridge burner.  All right,  Employee of the  Month opens  today.  Yep.  Can't wait to  see the numbers  on Monday.  It's going to  be number one  movie.  It's going to  be huge.  Scorsese's got  quite a fan base  himself,  but if we can  be the number  one comedy,  I won't be  crying.  Yeah,  well,  you'll definitely  get that.  You got that.  Jeez.  You got that.  The trailer  looked great.  I saw it  during Jackass. 
[04:04:00]  Yeah,  the reviews  from last night  are rolling in  because they  had screenings  starting at  midnight.  And that's  the thing.  People get  online and  hide behind  a screen  name and  then they'll  say anything.  Really?  But so far  everybody's  saying that  they dug  it and that  people are  laughing.  And here's  how famous  Dane is  before we  all go.  Because this  will be the  last time we  talk to him.  This is it.  I'm going to  tell you why  Dane is now  officially famous.  Dane has a  small gut,  but he's on  the cover of  Men's Health  magazine. 
[04:04:30]  Dane is out  of shape and  he's on the  cover of Men's  Health magazine.  That's to say  that is  fame.  You're insane.  Dane has a  little pudge.  I'm in the  best shape of  my week.  Dane's on  the cover of  Fitness  Illustrated  with a saggy  booty.  Unbelievable.  I'm fucking  amazed by that.  Patrice is on  the cover of  White Man's  magazine.  I swear to  God I want  to be.  Cigar  aficionado. 
[04:05:00]  That's my  goal.  Dane, I'm  going to set  a goal right  now.  I'm going to  be on  Cigar  aficionado.  How to  make it from  bed.  Dane  cook your  tickets for  Madison Square  Garden go on  sale Monday at  10 a.m.  through Ticketmaster.com.  It goes on to the  public.  I think pre-sale  we're already  almost halfway  sold out.  It should be  going up.  How many did  you sell pre-sale?  Pre-sale we've  already sold I think  over 10,000 in 48  hours.  It's only how many  seats there?  Like 12,000?  It's over 
[04:05:30]  Johnny.  19,000, 20,000  at the  hour.  There you go.  All right  Dane.  Go fuck  yourself.  Hey, you're  not one of the  haters I thought.  I'm going to  throw an egg  right at his  fucking head.  I'm a hater  now.  You're a  hater.  Fuck you  bastard.  All right  Dane.  Thank you so  much.  Happy anniversary  to you guys.  Thanks a lot  man.  You got it  fellas.  All right  Dane.  Dane Cook  that guy is  so fucking  famous now. 
[04:06:00]  Just so  fucking famous.  Patrice.  It's been  fun watching  you today  man.  You were  great.  Stand Up  New York  tonight and  tomorrow.  Wednesday.  Wednesday  Salem State  University.  That's right.  And next  Thursday is  Vinny's Club.  That's the  best factor.  That's the  one I'm  going to.  12,  yeah.  12,  13,  14.  Anthony  will be  there.  Okay.  Anthony  siding.  I don't  know what  you look  like doing  comedy outside  of Caroline's.  That's like  the only place  I go to.

Line of the  Day.  So he's just  trying to get  some poofah.  He's trying to  get some action.  All right.  That's why he's  complimented her 
[04:07:30]  hair out of  nowhere.  This is in  75 when a  condom was  just uncircumcised.  Patrice O'Neill  walks away with  Line of the  Day.  The condom  line.  They might  have needed a  setup, no?  No.  Self-explanatory,  I guess.  Yeah.  Because it was  1975.  Condom.  Unclipped.  Pre-AIDS.  Pre-AIDS.  There you go.  End of the  show?  Yeah, we  don't talk now.  Now it gets  all uncomfortable.  Because we  really don't talk  when the mic's 
[04:08:00]  off.  It gets all  uncomfortable.  This is the  last chance to  be my friend.  Yeah, until  you're back  again.  And then,  although,  for some reason,  Patrice will  stop at the  corner and be  on the phone,  and then we'll  kind of bump  into each other  and have a  little walk and  talk to the  garage.  Yeah, who do you  talk to on the  corner every day?  My girl.  After the show,  you're always  talking to someone  on that corner.  I've got to  talk to my  girl.  He's making  deal for fish  scale on the  phone.  Yeah, just to  let her know I'm  not sleeping with  ten bitches.  Sweetie, I'm  walking. 
[04:08:30]  Listen outside,  there's people  here, I'm not  in a brothel.  Take video,  motherfucker.  Email me  video.  He's going to  have to walk  around on  Pal Talk 24  hours a day.  Patrice,  always a pleasure.  Thanks, man.  Always.  All right.  Great job.  We had a lot of  fun this week.  Thanks, Patrice.  Hell yeah.  Is it over?  Good week.  We're still on  mic.  It's still going  out, over, but  yeah, we're done.  Oh, yeah.  The show is 
[04:09:00]  over.  Yeah.  Like anything  that could be  even slightly  entertaining has  stopped coming out  of the radios  right now, but  they're still on.  All right, folks.  Thanks.  See you later.  There you go.  That's how Patrice  rolls.  That's how he does  it.  Look at him.  He gets to leave  on the high note,  gave his plugs,  boom, he's gone.  Pretty good strategy.  I see you're using  it right now, too,  standing up and  leaving.  I'm beat.  I'm tired today.  That was a good  show, though.  It was a good 
[04:09:30]  week.  Good week of radio.  Yeah.  Except for our  stupid anniversary  show.  I hated that.  Fucking blue.  No more  anniversary shows.  We'll be replaying  that, I'm sure.  I'm sure E-Rock's  already got it  scheduled for a  fucking replay.  Dude, why?  No, why?  It was great.  What?  I thought you  liked.  Why are you anxious  to just sit there  and hang?  You're the one  usually leaving  already.  I'm not anxious  to sit here  and hang.  I'm a responsible  broadcaster,  and I see that...  We don't have  to be responsible.  It's after 11.  That's true.  All right.  Go fuck  yourselves. 
[04:10:00]  I'm done.  Hey, guys,  have a great  weekend.  Thanks for the  support.  We'll see you  on Monday.  On Monday.  Well, we got  some audio from  the Tonight  Show appearance.
