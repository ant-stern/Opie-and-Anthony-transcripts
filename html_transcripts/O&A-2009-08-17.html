<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast featured comedian Patrice O'Neal extensively, both as a guest and hosting segments.  The show opened with O'Neal hosting a "Worst Of" segment featuring a highly contentious phone interview with Amy Sutherland, author of "What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage." O'Neal aggressively challenged Sutherland's relationship advice, using vulgar language and animal training metaphors to express his disagreement, ultimately insulting her appearance and causing her to hang up.  Following the interview, O'Neal and others in studio made further disparaging remarks about Sutherland's appearance and read listener emails echoing these sentiments.

The show then transitioned to O'Neal recounting a bizarre encounter at a rest stop involving a well-dressed man repeatedly stating "It's cold out here," eventually attempting his car door handle. This led to discussions about rest stops, truckers, and homosexual encounters.  O'Neal teased an upcoming story about a threesome before moving on.

Next, O'Neal, as a guest, recounted a lengthy, graphic story about a complex romantic relationship involving a threesome and his girlfriend's jealousy.  He described his approach to relationships using metaphors like a "karate class" system, and the conversation included explicit details about his attempts to incorporate another woman into his relationship, his girlfriend's reactions, and the eventual resolution.  Opie, Anthony, and callers offered varied reactions and shared their own relationship experiences.

The broadcast continued with another "Worst Of" segment, this time focusing on a previous interview with Ludacris.  This segment began with an anonymous caller recounting multiple extramarital affairs and partner swapping, eliciting crude commentary from O'Neal.  The main focus was a studio interview with Ludacris, where he discussed his career transition, wealth, and responses to criticism from figures like Bill O'Reilly and Oprah Winfrey, including being dropped by Pepsi.  The conversation also touched on the potential tax implications of Obama's presidency and racial stereotypes in Hollywood.  O'Neal frequently interjected with offensive language and comedic commentary.

A segment featuring several lingerie-clad women from a lingerie bowling league as in-studio guests followed.  One woman, wearing a winter coat over her lingerie, refused to participate in the banter and was repeatedly berated by O'Neal using highly offensive and misogynistic language.  The other women remained compliant.  A lengthy, contentious discussion between O'Neal and Danny, another host, ensued, focusing on streaming movies online, further filled with racial slurs and insults. O'Neal eventually offered an insincere apology, and the segment concluded with the women leaving and continued arguing among the hosts.

The show proceeded to a heated argument between O'Neal and Danny about a computer issue, escalating into accusations of "white tricks" and racial slurs from O'Neal.  Callers Matt and Tugboat participated, and the argument included tangents about the show's hierarchy and even child pornography.  The discussion later shifted to an analysis of the dollar bill's design and Illuminati conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11.  Audio clips of the argument were played for clarification, and the bickering continued.

The broadcast concluded with a segment on the Illuminati, involving a studio guest named Mars.  The hosts, along with Mars, engaged in a rambling, profane discussion about Illuminati symbolism, focusing on owls, pyramids, pentagrams, and the number five.  They mocked Mars' beliefs initially, but participated in increasingly absurd speculation about the Bush family, Osama Bin Laden, and the destruction of the World Trade Center, while joking that the Illuminati's goal was to harm black people. The segment featured repeated use of offensive language and the showing of various images and video clips.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Number, Sirius 197, XM202, the virus.  All right, here we go.  Presenting a special edition of The Worst of Opie and Anthony, 
[00:00:30]  hosted by some of your favorite comedians from The Opie and Anthony Show.  Including Bill Burr.  Hey!  Bob Kelly.  Fucking I suck.  Patrice O'Neal.  Ready, nigga?  Rich Voss.  I've done Kimmel.  And Louis C.K.  Tune in every day this week as a different comedian from The Opie and Anthony Show hosts  The Worst of The Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, yo.  Hey.  Ah.  Ooh.  Wait, what's up, y'all?  This is Patrice O'Neal hosting The Worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:01:00]  And let me tell you something.  That's just fucking redundant.  Hosting?  Fucking, what does that even mean?  When I'm doing a monologue or something?  Really?  Yeah, you're introducing all the bits and everything.  Really?  Oh, get the fuck.  You niggas.  You niggas weren't slaves still in 2009.  Five hours of Opie and Anthony.  You didn't get sick of the first fucking two minutes?  You want five hours of this shit?  What's the matter with y'all?  Well, well, well.  It's bad guest day.  You know what? 
[00:01:30]  Listen to this chick, Amy Sutherland, right?  She gets on to promote her book.  What's the name of the book?  I'm trying to remember.  I think it's What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage, I think, if I'm not mistaken.  Anyway, I was in on it.  And, you know, I was brought in to debate her goofy-ass advice.  Hey, check out Bad Guest Day with Amy Sutherland.  Oh, God.  Just a big yawn.  Amy Sutherland, she's emailing, like, the show right after, because I guess she got hung up on. 
[00:02:00]  And she felt deceived, and the show emails her back apologizing, trying to get her back on.  It's some funny shit.  You got to listen to it.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  Amy Sutherland on our phone lines.  She's a tough cookie, this one.  Oh, absolutely.  She wrote a book.  Look out, guys.  Look out, guys.  She wrote a book that piqued our interest, How to Train Men.  Mm-hmm.  Let's talk to Amy Sutherland.  Amy. 
[00:02:30]  Hi.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  How are you?  I'm good.  How are you?  The name of the book, once again?  Is What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage.  Shamu, now, of course, you mean the killer whale down there at SeaWorld.  That's right.  Well, you're a tough cookie, Amy.  What's going on with this book?  Seems like you're really taking men to task.  Well, you know, the thing is, is that I wish I was a tough cookie.  I've always tried to be a tough cookie.  But, in fact, if I was using, you know, the way the trainers work now are all with rewards. 
[00:03:00]  And, you know, they're like, they're fuzzy and warm and nice to the old school trainers.  Sure, sure.  And I'm a new school trainer.  Ugh.  Sorry.  That's hilarious.  It's, again, automatically, I'm going to tell you what the flaw is in thinking.  You don't want to be the controller.  That's the thing.  Women don't want to win. 
[00:03:30]  You want a winner.  You don't want to rule the Nets.  That's why you've never met a happy woman boss.  Because you don't want to be there.  You're angry about being a boss.  You want a boss.  You want your man to be the leader.  Do you understand?  This is why it's already flawed on a prehistoric level.  Why would you don't want to run your husband?  Do you know why running your husband is not sexy?  Because you don't want to be there doing it.  That's why it never works for a woman to run things. 
[00:04:00]  Because you don't want to.  You look at your husband like, ugh.  Look at his bum letting me run his life.  Fooey.  You just have a loser for a man.  Well, but see, that's the thing is that this isn't about controlling.  This isn't about.  No.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Animal training.  But you go ahead.  No, you're doing an animal training thing.  It says reward behavior you want.  Ignore the behavior you don't want.  I want to hear how this works.  I really.  Well, but that means, I mean, the first thing you should know is that the way this works, 
[00:04:30]  the way trainers work now, is they don't use punishment.  They only use it, say, if the Shamu is attacking.  Actually, they don't even use it in that case either.  But, so what you do is lay off the punishment, which means that you lay off things like nagging.  So.  But that's not your, see, you've got to understand, nagging is what you do, right?  Yeah, but nagging doesn't work.  But see, that's, but see, already you're being, and I'm, again, I'm not angry.  I'm like, this is passionate things for me. 
[00:05:00]  I love talking about this stuff.  But, immediately, it's a man's fault for letting you think that your nagging would bother him.  I dismiss my woman when she nags.  Dismiss her.  Because the only power she has in her nagging is the power I give her.  It means nothing.  Even her jealousy means nothing unless I tell it to mean something.  If she's jealous, I let her know that the reason that it's working, her jealousy is working, is because I'm allowing it to work.  Is that the fact that I'm giving it some validation because I love her, and I go, look, I'll let you be jealous. 
[00:05:30]  I'll go, I'll explain who this girl was.  I'll explain what I was doing last night.  But if all I have to do is go, hey, shut up, what are you going to do ultimately?  See, ultimately, I can suck you through a wall.  Ultimately, you can't do nothing.  See, you're actually doing animal training.  Of course.  Because I'm the one that should be training you.  Yeah, I mean, you know how it works.  It's like the tuna is running the ocean. 
[00:06:00]  Tunas don't want to run the ocean.  Sharks run the ocean.  That's how the ecosystem works.  Bravo to Patrice.  Yeah, we should be doing the training, not you shouldn't be training us.  Well, but that's why it's already going on.  I mean, people are out there training each other.  You've got a boyfriend.  People are better than others at it.  You've got a boyfriend.  Pardon me?  I have a husband.  You've got to talk sexy, baby.  Where is this guy?  Is he on your book tour with you?  Am I what?  Is he what?  I'm sorry, I didn't understand you. 
[00:06:30]  What?  Go ahead.  Where is the guy?  He's out walking the dog.  Oh.  So what are you suggesting with this book?  Why don't you give us a few examples?  Well, basically what he was just talking about is that if you don't want, if there's a behavior you don't want, one of the best things you can do is ignore it, which is how exotic animal trainers work.  If they don't want the animal to do something that it's doing, then they don't reinforce it in any way, which is what you were saying.  But, miss, let me ask you.  And it's not happening.  Miss, respectfully, let me ask you. 
[00:07:00]  Don't you think, like, let's say you're in a relationship and you find that it's not going the way you want it to.  You want to train a person.  I mean, don't you feel that if the training isn't going where it should be, isn't that not going to, like, ultimately not reinforce something because of what was once said but not yesterday?  Like, you understand?  Not, I'm not sure.  I totally understand.  But I think what you're saying is that timing's important.  No, no, no.  That's not at all.  What I'm saying is in the relationship, if you're attempting to train somebody, is it possible that the training would be dragged out the wrong way and all of a sudden they're going, well, if I'm going to be trained, well, then who's not to train me? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, I guess so.  I mean, the thing is is that, you know, I mean, what I wrote about can really, it's not gender specific.  Right, but that's missing my point completely.  Yeah.  That's missing my, because I'm saying it is gender specific.  Do you feel that to train somebody, it should be a reverse situation as well?  Ideally, yeah.  Yeah, well, that's what we disagree. 
[00:08:00]  But the thing is is that, see, you're thinking a training is just that it decides who's in control.  But that's not what was said, though, because that's not what we're trying to make the point.  It's about gender specificness.  It's about.  No.  It's about communicating.  Well, you know, you're talking about your idea of training.  What I wrote about is how you can use your behavior to communicate what you want.  But Patrice, I'm sorry, go ahead.  You tell me, I apologize.  It's essentially how using the ideas exotic animal trainers use to get animals, to teach animals what they want them to do without using any kind of language, any kind of English. 
[00:08:30]  This is using sort of ideas to sort of teach each other with our behavior what we like and what we don't like.  You filthy slob.  What?  What?  So the book is titled What Bob Kelly Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage.  Patrice was raising some good issues, though, miss, about the training. 
[00:09:00]  I mean, do you agree or disagree?  Because Patrice is an author in himself.  But the control thing, though, miss, you are trying to control, though.  That's the thing.  If you're trying to train something, you're trying to control.  You're not trying to train a guy for equalness or happiness.  You're trying to train him for your happiness.  But see, that's all old school kind of training.  Right.  That's not the way trainers work now.  But if you train a dog, you're not training a dog to be your best buddy on an equal level. 
[00:09:30]  You're training them to do what you need them to do when you need them to do it.  That's what training is.  Yeah, but, I mean, when you train, when you get somebody, when you communicate to somebody what you would like them to do, is that taking control of them?  Yeah, if communication is not enough where you go, hey, can you do this, and he goes yes, then when he, this is, training is when you say, can you do this, and they go no.  And then you have to figure out ways to get them to say yes and make your life better. 
[00:10:00]  So, basically, you're saying people should never change each other's behavior ever.  No, they should be a leader of the relationship.  Yeah, or just get a divorce and find a new one.  That might be more compatible.  So, basically, the way, in your world, the leader says what goes, and that's...  Absolutely.  That's what happens in the Army.  Do the soldiers tell the general what they think?  No, they just do it.  And that's what makes the Army or the Navy or the Marines what it is, is because there's a leader of the situation.  Or the Air Force. 
[00:10:30]  Or the Air Force.  Well, I mean, I don't know.  We're talking two parallel universes.  I mean...  Not really.  Relationships are the same thing as the Army and the Navy.  It's just like attention.  Somebody has an actual place where they want you to be.  That's the thing.  See, there's a goal to what you're trying to do.  And what's that goal?  The goal is to communicate what you want to somebody.  Yeah.  So that you get along better.  So that you're happier, correct? 
[00:11:00]  Right.  So that you're not yelling and nagging and, you know, scrapping and fighting.  And that's what a lot of couples end up doing.  But it trickles...  It doesn't matter who's in charge.  If people aren't unhappy, there's...  It does matter who's in charge.  So why isn't your husband in charge?  You're in charge of him.  No.  I would disagree.  So what are you equal?  You've trained him, though.  Yeah, he's trained.  Are you training him?  The thing is, is that what I'm trying to say is that I haven't trained him and I haven't taken control of my marriage.  All I'm doing is using these ideas to communicate to my husband what I would like him to do. 
[00:11:30]  Whether he does it or not is ultimately his decision.  No, it's not.  Can I ask a question, please?  Because there's something I want to take issue with you.  Maybe you're saying you're not trying to, but it says one of your lessons.  Keep your cool.  Don't take an animal's actions personally, not even when the animal has left his smelly bike clothes on the bathroom floor  or snapped at you for nagging to get a hearing test.  I mean, don't you think that, like, with talk like that when you're discussing training,  that it's always going to come back to not necessarily bite the trainer, 
[00:12:00]  but also it just kind of circles everybody, whether you train them or if it's not going to happen.  Yep.  I didn't follow that.  Right.  No, of course not, because it's hurting your point.  What I'm saying is don't you feel that if you're going to train somebody that it's going to come full circle  and not always bite the person being trained, but also anybody who else is involved because of that.  And how so?  Right, exactly.  That's what I'm trying to say.  How to bite the person?  Because that's not what we're doing here.  Yeah, everything's going on. 
[00:12:30]  You've got issues, sweetheart.  See, the thing is that, you know, as long as you see this only as who's in control,  we have nothing to talk about.  Ooh, you have no way to scream at me.  Yes.  Are you suggesting we raise a generation of super husbands?  You know, I really have nothing to say about whether husbands are in charge or not because  that's got nothing to do with what I'm talking about.  See, here's the bottom line.  If you are suggesting and you have a book on how to train your husband. 
[00:13:00]  It's not a book about how to train husbands.  Oh, what is it then?  It's about how to communicate what you want to all the people in your life using these ideas that I found.  I'll be what's wrong.  So it's not just about husbands to begin with.  And, you know, it's not what you guys are saying it is.  You're just reading the title and deciding what you think the book's about.  Well, we're going by the little synopsis, too, like what Shamu taught me.  It's like a title does tell you what the book's about.  That's why we have titles. 
[00:13:30]  Because you don't want it just to be book number 15721.  The title has to tell you what it's about.  Like, I had a girlfriend one time.  And, you know, she wasn't as pretty as she thought.  She was kind of a thin-haired girl with, you know, kind of chiclet teeth and big gums, aggravating.  And I was always trying to boss me around.  And I finally had to go, you know what?  What the hey?  So would you rather be bossed around or would you like to have somebody be, you know, say thank you and smile at you when they did things, when you did things they liked?  I would like it to be a partnership with my girlfriend because she was always a good dresser. 
[00:14:00]  She'd have sweaters and little red shirts and just massive gums and little teeny teeth.  Fire!  What's the matter?  I just saw a picture of Amy.  Whoa.  Oh.  Comment? 
[00:14:30]  Comment?  That was, um...  My fever's back.  Mmm.  Feeling hot.  I don't, uh...  If that's necessary.  I apologize for that.  I think we should...  There's just, you know...  Amy, um...  Hang the phone up, you skank!  No, listen.  Listen, we don't need that. 
[00:15:00]  Oh, dice.  What I want to do is discuss the issue.  Oh, I just heard a click.  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Hello?  Amy?  Oh, you won't be, um...  Hello?  Oh.  You won't see her no more.  You won't see her no more.  You won't see her no more.  Oh, she had stopped her. 
[00:15:30]  Oh, my God.  Yeah, well...  Will she come back on?  Now what?  Can we get her back on if we say we're sorry?  Okay.  Let's say we're sorry.  What's wrong, E-Rock?  What's wrong? 
[00:16:00]  E-Rock, comment.  E-Rock, is it a bit awkward?  Patrice?  It's very...  We...  You're at a loss for words?  That's what it takes?  That was just uncomfortable.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  All right.  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen...  Patrice O'Neill is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, check out Bad Guest Day. 
[00:16:30]  Hey, listen to Bad Guest Day.  Author...  I don't know...  Yeah, wait.  Bad Guest Day.  Famous author Amy Sutherland...  You never heard of this, bitch.  Come on.  She refused to call back in, so the show composes a nasty e-mail to her on air.  Also, listeners decide to forward some e-mails they wrote to Amy, and I don't think she's happy.  Broadcast the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neill.  Danny's got an e-mail from Amy. 
[00:17:00]  Who was Amy again?  She wrote a book.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  She's an author.  Yeah, Danny, uh...  What's up, Danny?  You got a fine little e-mail from Amy?  You set up that interview.  I'm sorry?  You set that up.  Yeah.  Good job.  Nice.  Excellent.  Record time from hang-up to e-mail, I think, is a brand-new record.  I'd like to read this for you if you're lying.  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  E-mail reads, hey...  Did it say thanks for the interview?  Yeah, thanks for the air time?  Um, no.  No, it says, hey...  Ungrateful. 
[00:17:30]  Next time you want a punching bag for your program, call another author.  Why?  She was a great one.  Yeah, she was the Chuck Webner of authors.  Why would you want to fight someone else when you could fight Chuck Webner?  It continues.  Go ahead, Dan.  Sorry.  I made a big mistake trusting that this was a legit interview.  Yes, you did.  Okay, go ahead.  Not one where someone would make fun of what I look like and call me a skank.  How about you Google?  Well, Googling. 
[00:18:00]  Well, see, the genius of me is that I never actually told her what show it was.  Ah.  So...  Oh.  I didn't have the opportunity to do it.  Yeah.  Nice.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Not someone who would make fun of what I look like and call me a skank.  That was by far the worst treatment I've ever gotten.  Hey!  Congratulations, guys.  We hope so.  On this show.  Imagine if this was like the third or fourth worst.  Yeah.  Yes.  We'd have to try harder, Jimmy.  She had emailed me some press materials last night and also had asked if I could get back 
[00:18:30]  to her, letting her know who she'd be speaking with, and I subsequently just forgot to write  back.  Hmm.  So...  Can we go back to that moment?  You got it, E-Rock?  One more second.  All right.  We're going to go back to that moment in a second here.  I did respond, and I told her that...  We should get her back on the phone so we can apologize.  Tell her the guy...  You should tell her the guy that did that was asked to leave the...  I did.  I let her know that we had a comic guest who was, you know, trying a little too hard for shock  value, and we would like to handle this appropriate.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  And?  What happened, Danny?  What'd you say? 
[00:19:00]  Hopefully he'll call the hotline.  I wouldn't count on it.  Yeah.  We got it, E-Rock.  Yeah.  All right.  Here's the moment.  Amy, who wrote that relationship book that really frustrated Patrice, for sure.  It was dumb, right?  He just smashed her.  He just schooled her.  So would you rather be bossed around, or would you like to have somebody be, you know, say  thank you and smile at you when they did things, when you did things they liked?  I would like it to be a partnership with my girlfriend, because she was always a good 
[00:19:30]  dresser.  She'd have sweaters and little red shirts, and just massive gums, and little teeny teeth.  Ah!  What's the matter?  I just saw a picture of Amy.  Oh.  Oh.  Comment?  Hmm.  I don't, uh... 
[00:20:00]  I think that's necessary.  I apologize for that.  I think we should...  That's just, you know...  Amy, um...  Hang the phone up, you skank!  No, listen.  Listen, we don't need that.  Oh, nice.  What I want to do is discuss you.  I just heard it, and there was the click.  Oh, oh, Jesus.  Hello?  Thanks, Rumi.  Oh, you won't be, um...  Hello?  Uh...  You won't see her no more. 
[00:20:30]  We're back live.  The beauty of that audio, by the way, uh, Jimmy was describing, not his ex-girlfriend,  he was, he was describing Amy.  Oh, no.  Yeah, there was a picture of her up.  Yeah, there was a picture of her up, and Jimmy was describing what she looked like to  her.  She's a gummy bitch.  But she had no idea.  Nice gums, stupid.  God, I was...  Her gums actually look like gum.  It looks like she had taken Hubba Bubba and fashioned gums from them.  I actually want to put a K-Rock sign on those gums. 
[00:21:00]  Have her stay on the turnpike.  Nice gums hole.  He said gums look like gums.  Oh, that poor man she's with.  Well, hopefully she'll call back and we'll apologize.  Yes.  Is this the thin-lipped, gummy woman?  She's just chock full of gums.  Lonely man sees woman with large protruding gums for emasculation.  With that nice, easy-to-care-for hairdo.  For emasculation.  If you like pina colada. 
[00:21:30]  Yeah.  She has hair like Sandy Duncan and just that stupid...  There's no place on her face without a few crow's feet.  Oh, those crow's feet.  Crow's feet.  Crow's feet.  Crow's feet.  It's a flock of crow's feet.  Crow's been stomping.  Just crow's legs.  I believe it's called a murder.  A murder of crows.  Her face is a crow's shoe store.  It's like the crows are just stomping all over her face.  A little crow podiatry shop.  All over her face. 
[00:22:00]  She's not supposed to have crow feet on your cheeks.  She has them on her cheeks.  She has them by her eyes.  Under her eyes.  On her forehead.  The crow podiatry.  Oh, yeah.  She's just crow-y.  She really is crow.  There's no...  I could see if she was like model pretty to be writing a book like this.  But when you look like that, just...  But model pretty wouldn't even need to even discuss that book.  Right.  She should be thankful for whatever she's got.  She looks like she has dry gums.  Only...  Like when her lip goes over her goblet, it goes...  It sticks. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah, because there's no saliva.  Only a woman that looks like that could think about writing that book.  She's smiling.  And look how dry those gums are.  That's why she saw Shamu, so he would splash water onto her gums.  She sat in the front row and just left her gums there for Shamu to splash.  She wanted it in high school.  She was voted girl most likely to have rainbow gums.  How many colors are her gums?  Rainbow gums.  Because they're so dry.  They're like light pink.  They're dark and there's a streak across them like Saturn.  She's the only one that needs chapstick for her gums. 
[00:23:00]  It looks like...  It looks like put-in Halloween teeth.  It's like...  All right, she should be calling any moment.  So, right?  Right, Dan?  Any moment?  Oh, God.  Oh, put in Halloween teeth.  We're men here.  We'll apologize.  We'll apologize.  Oh, she's hiding the fangs.  Gummy whore with a rotten little zip by her stupid...  Her little puppet lines in her face. 
[00:23:30]  That is absolutely...  Is that what...  Did Patrice mention alien?  Oh, no.  Looks like those should just come out of her mouth.  The little mouth.  The little alien mouth.  Those are the little teeth that should come out and bite your heart out.  Oh, the little alien teeth that come out the big mouth.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That poor woman.  I feel bad.  That poor woman.  I don't.  Please.  Haven't given her enough.  She should frown in that picture.  You don't show gums like that in the way of a book doing anything but apologizing.  Wow. 
[00:24:00]  Get a husband on the phone.  Does he have his own cell phone?  That poor bastard.  He's an oral surgeon.  He's looked at her like he's really...  She's his thesis.  If I can shrink this woman's gums, they'll put me in head of the department.  Sam.  All of a sudden you're with Quincy.  Sam, her gums were pulled down like a window chain.  Oh, my God. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, that red shirt and that horrible sky blue and orange sweater.  Oh, she's terrible.  Looks like she's wearing a Christmas sweater or something.  It's just horrendous.  There's a picture of her with her two dogs.  Big earrings.  Oh, she bugs me.  Oh, she's holding a dog.  I don't feel bad just because of the type of book she wrote.  I mean, you know what I mean?  That's the problem.  The fact that she has hair like Kelly from the Bad News Bears.  She should be smoking and belting a double off the wall.  Or Jodie Foster from Taxi Driver. 
[00:25:00]  Or Chigar from No Country for Old Men.  Chigar from No Country for Old Men.  Fix those gums, friendo.  She's got like little buck teeth in her smile.  Yeah, even when she's smiling and she's trying to hide the gums, she gets her buck tooth thing going.  Oh, her completely awful sweater and wrinkled shirt collar.  She really bothers me.  Look at the look on the dog's face.  They just hate her. 
[00:25:30]  I bet you that she has dogs.  They lick her gums.  She puts peanut butter on her gums.  One dog's going this way.  No one's going that way.  Exactly.  She's like, I don't know what's happening.  She's got to moisturize her gums with dog saliva.  She's very religious.  There's a thing.  It's called footprints.  There was times where I saw only one set of prints on your gums.  Why crows did you abandon me?  I guarantee you this will make at least 20,000 more people buy her book just to read it. 
[00:26:00]  Of course.  Just to see a picture in the...  Oh, we got audio of her on YouTube.  What is she doing here?  Can we get some of this audio maybe?  She's got the sweater vest.  Oh, she's terrible.  She looks a little younger.  She looks a little...  Her hair is a little longer.  We're in Ellen's clothes.  Yeah.  Very manly clothing.  Billie Jean Hathaway.  Miss Hathaway.  I want you to go down to the Clampets.  Well, I don't know, Chief. 
[00:26:30]  That dyke.  Oh, my God.  Was she a dyke?  Miss Martina Natcho to Hathaway.  Hathaway.  Wow.  Oh, she's terrible.  She's a wet head.  Ladies and gentlemen,  Patrice O'Neill is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, we're trying to get Amy back on the phone.  Is it not happening?  Oh, didn't you get more emails from Amy, the author?  I certainly did.  The update is that she won't come on the air because she doesn't trust us.  Okay.  Meanwhile, she's the one that said we should call her, but she won't come on the air. 
[00:27:00]  Okay.  However, she is forwarding me many of the Pest's emails that have made it her way.  Are they all sorry about what happened today?  Sort of, yeah.  We all heard CokeLogic's email.  Here's one that was forwarded from...  From Amy to you.  From Amy to me.  This is from a guy named William.  He says,  Love your time on Opie and Anthony's show today.  Keep up the good work, old silly putty gums.  Here's one from...  They're making fun of her gums.  Here's one from Thomas.  This one's pretty straightforward. 
[00:27:30]  Oh, God, please do something with your gums and teeth.  What else?  Please read another one, Daniel.  Sure.  I will acknowledge that.  Here's one that was sent to her with the subject of boycott CBS Radio, boycott Opie and Anthony.  The problem, however, is that it was sent from Poop Face.  The body of the email reads,  These two have been doing awful things for years, but after this morning, enough is enough.  We have to take a stand and let their employees at CBS Radio know that we will not tolerate those two idiots anymore. 
[00:28:00]  They were fired for a blah-blah-blah stunt involving sex in a church.  I, for one, refuse to sit back and let these buffoons make fun of grandmotherly cunts such as yourself.  Only with your help can we get rid of O&A and the faggot.  Here's another one.  Please read another one.  All right.  Well, I have one more left, so you want me to save it?  Yeah, there is.  Oh, I love these. 
[00:28:30]  Okay.  This last one.  Well, disrespectful.  It's probably my favorite one, too.  It's from Bertino, and it reads,  Dear Sloth from the Goonies' Mouth.  Oh, that's mean.  Opie and Anthony would like to continue the interview, so please call back.  But she might be kind of funny since she's forwarded them to it.  Like, why is she forwarded them to it?  She might be laughing.  How abusive the fans are.  I think she's doing it because I think she's really bothered.  Yeah.  And that's why she's doing it. 
[00:29:00]  She's not heeding her own advice and saying just to ignore bad behavior.  She's going against her own book.  I think she's encouraging bad behavior.  Yeah, she's letting you know what meanness has been introduced to her life.  Yeah, I mean, I don't think she's ever experienced this brand of humor.  Hey, Sloth from the Goonies!  They're all talking about her gums.  That one made me laugh so hard.  It sucks because I'm getting them on my Blackberry,  and so I'm just hysterically laughing while other things are going on in studio. 
[00:29:30]  That's so terrible, man.  This poor woman has no ammunition for the ass.  Exactly.  Don't write a fucking book on how to train men, silly.  Really?  We'll just make fun of your gums.  Can you imagine how easy just to dismiss this bitch is like,  I wrote a book that's helped women and shut up old butter gums.  And she just fucking lost it.  And just gone.  That's it.  Just, I can't train this one.  So any motherfucking guy that let this fucking bitch train them, they're just useless.  Yeah.  They're stupid. 
[00:30:00]  They bazooka choke them.  They got one physical flaw, and it's like fucking Siegfried and Roy with that big tiger.  But no one's ever had the audacity to just go, look at your dumb chiclet teeth.  That brought her back to when she was in the third grade.  Exactly.  No training.  A bunch of boys laughing at us.  No thin hair, and they're just pointing and going, ah, shut up, bitch.  Dopey guys fucking with her.  Shut the fuck back.  So then to give you some more worst of ONA material, you understand? 
[00:30:30]  Hey, this one is, as far as show listeners are concerned,  this particular ditty is the, it's cold outside story.  So, enjoy.  Broadcast of the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice, you got to tell your story.  Oh, shit.  Dude, that is a funny fucking story, man.  That is a really funny fucking story.  Listen to what happened to Patrice since the last time we saw him. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, it was like Christmas time.  I had driven home, went to, you know, go to Boston for a second.  So, I'm driving back, driving back through, you know, Connecticut.  You know, you know, you drive and you get that, that, that scared, tired,  like that tired that you just, you go, oh my God, I'm getting ready to die.  Yeah.  Like, you don't have any more confidence in yourself that you can keep yourself awake.  You're like, oh, damn.  It's cold, so all the windows are down.  Yeah.  Fucking young Jeezy.  Yeah, I'm up, motherfuckers. 
[00:31:30]  Blasting, punching your leg.  And just that type of tired where I went to sleep a couple of times.  So, I said, I got to find some, I was getting ready to pull over to the side.  Do you start having the logic in your head where you're like, I could close my eyes for five seconds.  She's not when you're driving.  You've never done that?  No.  I've sat there.  Oh, I've done that.  Petrified, just like Patrice is talking.  I think I can give it just two seconds.  I sit there with your eyes open going, motherfucker, you've got to stay away. 
[00:32:00]  You've never negotiated with yourself?  No, no, I have.  And said, I think I can do a couple seconds here?  No.  Because you're so tired that your logic is starting to go?  No, my logic goes in a different way, where you're driving, your eyes are open,  you're watching the road, and you're going, motherfucker, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake, stay awake.  Stay awake.  All right.  Stay awake.  And then, like, oh, trees, road, sky, and you're just out, and then, what the fuck?  I was just telling you to stay awake, asshole. 
[00:32:30]  Like, first you're driving, and your hand is at the bottom, you know, where your hand is pointed up,  and you're controlling the bottom of the wheel.  Then when you get those scares, you put your left hand out the window, hang out the window,  drive with your hand on the top.  Okay, I'm up now.  No.  I do.  I'm that kind of horrified tired, so I've got to stop.  I do the Harvey Keitel fucking Reservoir Dogs chant to myself, you've got to stay awake.  Come on.  I smack myself in the face. 
[00:33:00]  Stay awake.  Stay awake.  You're going to fucking stay awake.  I don't know how, like, the truck drivers, they must know tricks.  Yeah, they know tricks, all right.  It comes in a bottle, or it comes in fucking a piece of tinfoil, or whatever the fuck.  Oh, shit.  It's called crystal methadrine.  See, I'm corny.  I really am a corny motherfucker, because I'm thinking, boy, those guys, man, how do they  do it?  Cocaine!  Coke, crystal meth, whatever keeps you fucking going.  Whatever gets the load there on time.  Oh, my God.  It gets you from wrapping up a family of five. 
[00:33:30]  And they're thinking they must have, oh, they channel Yum Curry, the magical truck god that  gives them energy and strength, you know?  The truck god.  The truck god.  There's a truck god.  You snort it through a straw, you smoke it, whatever.  Oh, my God.  So, I start driving and shit, and I go, I see a McDonald's in the distant, you know,  oh, shit, McDonald's fucking rest stop.  Yeah.  I just do 95 till I get there. 
[00:34:00]  Pull in there, park.  I go, thank God.  I lean my seat back.  Now, you know, I drive up.  What time is this about?  About three in the morning.  I always leave at night.  Way to go, Mr. Jordan.  Wow.  Way to go, Mr. Jordan.  I just always leave late.  I just always just go there and come back, like, leave at 12.  Yeah.  No traffic.  I kind of like the no traffic angle.  Yeah, no traffic.  When you're falling asleep.  Go down to Merritt or 95s from time to time.  Yeah.  So, I park there.  I put my seat back.  Now, I drive a Suburban, and it's nigg it up big time. 
[00:34:30]  Like, you know, I got 22s just so don't fuck because I drive in New York.  I would get 24s.  Yeah.  But, you know, the potholes fuck your shit up.  So, I got tent that's like as black as anything, you know.  And the whole nine.  So, you know, I put my seat back.  Whew.  Thanking God.  Put my skylight up.  I look in the sky and shit.  Just fall asleep.  I lean back.  You're probably out in like two seconds.  About two seconds.  Yeah.  But for some reason, you know, after about a good five minutes of sleeping, I just, my  eyes open.  Nothing woke me up. 
[00:35:00]  Just my eyes open.  Not a sound.  Nothing.  Just open your eyes.  Oh, boy.  I look to the left.  Then I look to my right.  Out on my passenger side.  There's a guy looking in my window.  Oh, man.  Clean cut white guy.  Abercrombie and Fitch.  Yeah.  Fucking ties.  Clean.  And I'm looking at him.  And I'm staring at him.  Did you jump or?  No.  No.  I don't get scared like that.  Like, just.  I can't fucking have anybody.  Movie fear fucks me up. 
[00:35:30]  Like, you know, creepy shadow figures.  But, like, people don't.  Dude.  Fucking any.  If I open my eyes and someone's there or something.  Bad dick.  Yeah.  You've got to try to stay cool.  Oh.  And you've got to understand.  I almost got raped by that big black guy.  I stayed cool.  You've got to understand how tinted my windows are.  Oh.  Yeah.  You've got to understand this.  Now, I look at him to try to give him, like, for 30 seconds, we were looking at each  other.  Like, just kind of staring.  So, I finally go, okay. 
[00:36:00]  This nigga ain't leaving.  I turn my key backwards.  Crack my window about an inch.  I go, what's up, man?  He goes, it's cold out here.  It's cold.  It's cold out.  It's cold out.  I go, what?  He goes, it's cold out here.  And he tries my handle on my door.  He pulls my door handle.  Holy shit. 
[00:36:30]  It's cold out here.  Pulls my door.  I go, what the fuck?  We'll go inside.  I go, we'll go inside.  There's coffee in there.  Now, I'm sitting there not thinking anything except for this is some crazy motherfucker who  needs warmth.  And I'm going, well, you know, I'm sorry, dude, but, you know, you're not going to warm  up in my fucking car, you know?  He thought you were a gangster fan.  And so, he walks away.  I'm looking at him.  And I'm still not, my energy still isn't like, what the fuck?  I'm just like, that was weird. 
[00:37:00]  That's a little odd.  From New York, you know?  Yeah.  So, I watch him, this motherfucker gets into a Subaru Outback with a Christmas tree on top  and drives away.  And that's when, that's when the adrenaline kicked.  I said, this motherfucker, he was going, he was going to suck strange black dick before  he went home to take a Christmas tree to his fucking family.  It gave me, it was like drinking 14 cups of coffee and a red bull. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, you were awake.  Once I said, this guy was a fad.  I didn't know.  I thought he was just a creepy cold guy.  He's a creepy cold guy.  A little cold.  I felt so bad for women that this guy, I wanted to, it was almost like I let something evil  escape.  Like, I wanted to follow him and just go to his lair.  And warn everybody.  And go, this guy is, ma'am, your husband is trying to suck strange gangster cock. 
[00:38:00]  And it, it, it was, and it was just like Gangsta Fag's song.  It was a well-dressed fucking businessman type sucking dick at a Connecticut restaurant.  Right, dude.  Wow.  It was un, it's cold out here.  What?  It's cold out here.  That's something that you say.  And pulls my fucking, my handle on my door.  Like you felt like you let something evil escape like that.  I felt like I let him, like I said, I should have, like for the duty of the world, like 
[00:38:30]  just chase this guy.  Because you think the family he's bringing that fucking Christmas tree home has any clue  that their husband is sucking rest stop dick and has a rest stop code.  Like I'm going, if I was a fag, is that the code?  It's cold out here.  Right.  So the pigeons fly in January.  Hop on in, faggot.  Hop on in.  Click.  The door unlocks.  Click, click.  You think he drove away with Christmas music in his car like that?  He gets in and rubs his hand like, it really was cold out there. 
[00:39:00]  That wasn't the fag code, but it's chilly.  I'm just cold.  Thanks for helping a brother out.  That's what got me was the Subaru Outback.  And I just covered my mouth like, I just let, I let evil go.  I let it go.  I let it, I should have followed him.  Honey, honey, I'm home with the tree.  Get the kids.  With the fucking tree.  And he, with the dude.  I shouldn't even care about shit like that.  You know what I'm saying?  It's just, it seems so evil.  Yeah.  So fucking evil.  Wow. 
[00:39:30]  Wow.  It's cold out here.  It's cold out here.  Well, anyone ask that.  Way to read the signs though, you dummy.  I'm such a, I'm so, I'm a fag.  You told him to go into the McDonald's.  Yeah, yeah.  Like that wouldn't be your first thought if you were really cold.  Get my dick sucked at McDonald's?  Wait a minute, yes.  But just, listen.  Fuck, thank you, Patrice.  I was really stupid.  I wasn't sure if I should go into this really warm building in your car.  And now that you're telling me, of course I should go in the building.  You deserve the pounding you're about to give me.  But it's like, none of my reaction was your fucking faggot. 
[00:40:00]  It was, it's cold out here.  Huh?  And my mind was trying to think of a way, and this is what I was thinking.  Not get out of here, fag.  It was, hey, I can't, I can't let you warm up in my car.  Yeah.  I mean, God bless you, you're cold and it's a cold day, but go inside.  I'm surprised you didn't tell the guy, what, did they lose their heat in there?  What?  You need some money for coffee?  Yeah, you dummy. 
[00:40:30]  Wow.  Let's go to Paul the trucker.  Hey, Paul, what's up?  It's what, hold on, hold on, Paul, sorry.  Yeah, fuck the McDonald's or anything.  He had his own car.  No, I didn't see him.  Warm in his car.  Holy shit, even better, Patrice.  Yeah.  I didn't, I woke up to see him.  So you didn't know he had the car until later.  I didn't even see this motherfucker.  I woke up to see him at my passenger side with his face in my shit.  But that even confirms it more because, let's say he was a fucking drunk and he got thrown 
[00:41:00]  out of McDonald's and that's why he was cold.  Like, you could even rationalize that until he gets in his own car that fucking, like,  has heat.  Someone's making a great point here, Brian in Rhode Island.  Go ahead.  Brian, go ahead.  Hey, didn't Patricia say that it was like three in the morning?  What the hell's this guy doing getting a Christmas tree at three in the morning?  Das, das, dude, this is.  It might have been his prop.  The whole evil was going through my head like, honey, I'm on the way. 
[00:41:30]  I work late.  I'm on the way home from blah, blah, blah.  Dude, he had a family because he had a super room out back and a Christmas tree on top.  It's like it was so after that is when it kicked in.  The creepiness of it kicked in then.  And I thought of it.  What the fuck are you doing out here with a Christmas tree at three?  You're just coming.  Hey, it's four, honey.  You know, I picked up a Christmas tree from the all-night Christmas tree place up on Connecticut Boulevard. 
[00:42:00]  And this mother, man, dude, it's cold out here.  He was on some kind of fucking little business thing where he tells the wife, you know,  I'm going to be working late.  He's just perusing black men porno sites, getting himself all worked up.  Has the Christmas tree.  It's three in the morning, he figures he better get home, and then he sees the rest stop.  Here we go.  And you're just the prize right there.  I was the grand prize.  You're a merry fucking Christmas. 
[00:42:30]  You might as well put a bow around your fucking, a mistletoe on your belt buckle.  Merry Christmas.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Here's a black gentleman for you.  It's coming early, man.  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, shit.  And what do you want, successful white man?  I'd like a black gangster cock.  Right here in the rest stop.  And I am so, like, if you don't know me, you know, I just like to dress the part.  Yeah.  But, you know, I'm a comedian.  But my whole out thing is like, you know, giant black dude. 
[00:43:00]  I'm in a tinted up truck.  I got my hoodie on, my this and that.  Yeah, the first impression of that would be I'm not walking up to his fucking vehicle  and asking directions.  I'm not going for legitimate purposes to your fucking vehicle and knocking on the window  while you're sleeping.  And he just was looking like this.  Just a stare.  I can't even, like, describe it on a random stare.  It was just looking.  That stare of wanting.  Wanting.  But then when he said his, when he made his move, when he made his move, he didn't look 
[00:43:30]  at me.  He turned to the, so his profile was at my window.  His good side.  So when I rolled the window down a little bit, what's up?  And it just, he didn't look me in the eye.  He didn't have the common decency to look you in the eye to ask for the cock.  It's cold out here.  It's cold out here.  All right, let's go to Paul.  He's a trucker.  He has creepy shit.  Paul the trucker, what's up?  The rest stops have, like, become the new gay bathhouses of America.  But I was in Gwinnett, Georgia, and I stopped, and I was letting you go pick up a trailer. 
[00:44:00]  And, you know, I was there for about five or six hours.  I went in to use the bathroom, and the phone rings.  You know, the pay phone, and I'm like, okay, whatever.  I keep going.  Come back.  The phone rings again.  I'm like, oh, okay.  I'm picturing myself thinking I'm not in the twilight zone.  So I get in the truck, I made me something to eat.  Go back out.  Get a soda out of the vending machine.  This phone rings again.  I'm like, all right, what's up?  So I'm looking around.  And I pick the phone, and the guy's like, it's, oh, suck your cock.  And I'm going, huh, what?  I'm looking around the phone.  Holy Jesus. 
[00:44:30]  So I hang the phone.  I'm walking back, and this cop pulls up, and he's just laughing his ass off.  And I go, what's so funny?  He goes, you answered the phone, didn't you?  I go, yeah, why?  Because I was watching.  He goes, there's probably some gay guy in the car over here wanting to blow you.  And I was like, what?  He's like, oh, yeah.  He goes, this is like the prime homosexual hangout.  And they know the pay phone number?  What they do is, yeah, they pull up, and they hit the pay phone number.  Then when you walk by, they dial it, and you pick it up.  It's like, you're such a cock.  Oh, it's just like, holy Jesus. 
[00:45:00]  Sag's a genius.  Because if I started to beat the shit out of that motherfucker, all he said was, it's  cold out here.  It's cold out here.  Here you go.  I'll jerk your balls.  Right.  It's like they're so covert just to get in.  Keep up the good work, boys.  All right.  Thanks, Paul.  You know what it's like?  It's like Dracula.  You've got to invite him in.  See, it's cold out here.  And you had to then invite him in in order to make the next step.  When he knew I wasn't a fag, he immediately bounced. 
[00:45:30]  But it wasn't like, okay, it wasn't like, oh, I'm sorry.  He left.  Like, you ever see that thing in the Godfather where they say, listen, you don't run.  You don't walk.  Don't look no one eye.  You don't look no one eye.  You don't look away either.  You don't look away either.  That's how he left.  He just goes, oh, all right.  And walked calmly away.  Like, almost like he knew I would be in shock if I wasn't a fag.  Right.  Don't give you any time to really think about it.  Just leave the situation.

Nigga, you're trying to make you motherfuckers laugh.  Give us a break.  Anyway, sit back and enjoy my threesome story from 2000 and... 
[00:47:00]  When did I get that fucking side pussy?  I had a...  Was it 2007 or 2006?  God.  Ugh.  Sit back and enjoy one of the greatest fucking feelings I've ever had in my life.  Ugh.  Getting my balls licked by a strange bitch while my favorite girl was looking.  Ah.  That's the type of shit you need.  T.  You need T to go, ah.  Ball licking.  Listen to my threesome story.  It's delicious.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal. 
[00:47:30]  Hey, uh, so I'm a little tired today and I kind of brought this up with Patrice before  the show and then Patrice said that he's really tired today as well.  And your story is much more interesting than my horse, S.  What?  With the argument with the, are you allowed to go there or with the chick and all that?  Yeah, I could go there.  I definitely could go there.  Well, just tell people why you, uh, why you're a little tired today.  Well, me and my, I don't know if it's so fresh and it's so real too.  It's so fresh.  It's still fresh. 
[00:48:00]  It's fresh.  Brand new stuff.  Yeah.  Cause you know, I've been trying to, my, my pickup line now is to any chick I go, look,  me and my girlfriend, uh, are not seeing anybody.  That is an interesting way to put it.  Me and my girlfriend, just to open line, me and my girlfriend are single.  And what I'm trying to do, I'm just trying to stay, uh, if this even sounds right, faithful  by like, look, she's, she's into that.  So I'm just trying to, I'm, what I did is like, what happens is anybody out there who's 
[00:48:30]  trying to get in the threesomes, the, the, the protocol is that your girlfriend or your  wife, she solicits women.  And if y'all want to do a little train thing with your wife, you solicit the guys.  What's happening is when, when she's soliciting the women, she realizing how dumb women are  like how, like she's a trooper, but she goes and goes, I want to, other women must be like  me and women treat her like they treat a dude.  Like, Hey, how you doing?  She's like, Hey, I'm pretty.  And would you like to, and she realized, you would think it would be easy. 
[00:49:00]  Cause she's a girl, she's a girl.  Yeah.  She's starting to realize how annoying women are in terms of sex.  So basically I met a chick like five months ago and put the, put a little work in.  Now we only talk like three times, but the first time I met, I'm like, Hey, look, um,  why don't you come on with me and my girl?  We're single.  Blam.  She's like, I can't, but she'll call me on the phone.  And my girl got mad.  Cause she, why does this girl have your number?  But I give my number out all the time. 
[00:49:30]  Like when she, if a chick, I'm very accessible.  If people know me, I'm really, a lot of people got my number.  So it's like, I say, here, you need to call me, call me and find out when I, when I,  you know, work next.  What happens is I then talk to this chick and I say, look, she finally gives in a little  bit.  I said, go to my girl's job.  And.  Oh my God.  There's so many problems in this story writing, man.  Go to your girl's job.  I said, look, go to my girl's job and just go in and meet her. 
[00:50:00]  Cause I understand like, if you wanted me to sleep with you and you had a boyfriend  and I'd be like, Oh, some strange dude.  And then I would want to meet the dude and say, okay, this dude is cool.  I will knock your wife up.  So I said to the girl, I said, you know, it'd be cool for you to go and, and, and see her  down her job.  My girl's a trooper.  I called my girl to say, Hey, look, somebody's coming down to check you out, you know, and 
[00:50:30]  you know, see if you like her.  So it was, it was on, she, she almost got fired from a job cause she went down and said  she just went bananas.  So we're arguing and trying to make sense of it all.  And I'm telling her, look, if, if we're going to do a threesome, which we want to, we can't  keep buying hookers.  We, we're trying to find what I'm trying to do is big love.  You seen that show?  She, that's what she's afraid of.  See, she likes to hook us cause it's like, bam, beat it or, but I'm trying to get a square 
[00:51:00]  broad to be our girlfriend.  And I'm like, look, if I take you shopping, listen, baby, if I buy, if I buy both of y'all  panties, I'm a buy you four and her too.  You know what I mean?  Right.  Just to keep, you're still a little better than, than she, I'm going to keep, she's going  to be, and I told her, I said, look, you, where you are our girlfriend.  You, and when people ask you, do you have a, you know, I don't have a boyfriend.  I have a couple and you are treading on some dangerous ground, but by the end logic wins 
[00:51:30]  man.  Cause she, she can't do it cause she keeps playing around cause she's frustrated about  how dumb women are.  And she thinks that since I set up the situation that this opens up more for me to be spending  time with this girl.  But I'm like, even if you bring a chicken, I could spend time with this girl.  So finally I ended up telling her, look, I don't see other women.  If I wanted to, first of all, I sent the broad down there to you. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, well, of course.  Then makes you the gentleman.  Makes you the perfect gentleman in this whole thing.  Oh, well, it's all in the open.  This is fine.  Listen to me.  I sent the broad down there.  I sent her down.  We all understand what you're saying, but we also understand why the girl's not going  to accept what you're saying.  What I said, my girl should be more.  It's like, we're a team.  Look, the bottom line is your girl, you're getting 100% more girl. 
[00:52:30]  She's getting 50% less guy.  Absolutely not.  That is just the way it works.  And four panties compared to two is not going to keep her happy.  By the way, at least 50% less guy.  That's the best she can do.  Normally, it's probably going to be 25, 75, 75 to the new chick.  You know what it is?  Me and her get 50% more love for each other.  For each other?  And our relationship gets 100%.  So we're up 200%. 
[00:53:00]  You're nuts.  Because me and her going to love each other 50% more just because the excitement and the thing.  And this girl gets 100% of a couple.  This is our girlfriend, man.  She's going to hang out.  So you're looking for a longer term thing with the same different girl.  So instead of hookers or some one night stand thing, you could call her up or she could call you and go,  hey, let's go out and then we'll all go back. 
[00:53:30]  Or maybe they become friends.  And the thing is, what if I like her?  She says, what if I like her more than you?  I'm like, what?  That'd be great if they both dumped you.  That would make me so happy.  You know what?  You suck.  Like, why are we with this guy?  We love each other.  We love each other.  But then they'll just be walking around like two fruitcakes with their heads bobbling.  No guidance.  You're the runner.  Hey, oh, I know it's – I didn't expect to tell the story.  But, oh, man, I'm saying she thinks – I said, look, and this is to your girl, your girl. 
[00:54:00]  I don't – I don't get –  So the problem –  I can get another girl if I feel like it and there's nothing you can do about it.  But the problem is –  To protect yourself.  So your girlfriend is mad that you were talking to this girl on the side even though you were talking to her on the side to set up the threesome.  Yes.  And you feel like your girlfriend should understand that.  Because two guys, right?  If she was in the vein – because she is a girl. 
[00:54:30]  What do we all want to live in Patrice's world?  Patrice's world is just a special place.  It's way out.  You got to – you need a passport to get there.  It's far away.  You need to live in Utah.  You got to take –  Or some third-world country somewhere where you're the gang.  Give your shots.  It's just so far away.  Oh, the only thing – the only thing she was mad at is the idea that this girl would get attention beyond her.  Like, all of a sudden, I'm walking around with this girl. 
[00:55:00]  We're eating by ourselves.  That isn't a viable concern of hers?  Yes, but everything is a viable concern.  And I'm telling her, have faith that it ain't going to be because why would I – why would I send this girl down there to exercise what – the faith, the faith in the threesome?  I send her to her.  I said, go to see this girl.  I love how he's putting so much credence in that.  Oh, yeah.  He gets so mad.  Like, why doesn't this dumb broad understand this? 
[00:55:30]  Patrice, do you understand?  Really?  You sound exactly like Opie's parking lot story to everybody.  And I'm talking about stupid parking.  No one's agreeing with you.  Well, we understand, but we also –  Right.  It is very similar to what I'm talking about.  Look, all I want to do is get into parking lot B.  He's justifying it by saying, look, I sent you.  I sent her over there.  Yeah.  You know, so the honesty is there.  You're being very forthright with this. 
[00:56:00]  You could – you could just go out and cheat.  I could just – I could easily, easily, because this girl likes me, man.  I could easily just go, I don't have a girlfriend or my girlfriend, she's on the way out.  And I could just schmooze this girl and it's possible that we'll be –  Don't you understand that's kind of gunboat diplomacy you're using there?  You're holding that threat over your girl's head.  Like, it's not so much an explanation of, look what I could do.  It's like, look what I could do, but I'm not. 
[00:56:30]  No, no, no.  It's there.  The gun's in your head.  The gun's in your head.  But I'm not going to pull the trigger because, you know, I'm invited.  No, I'm not holding her hostage with that.  I am not holding her hostage with – what I'm saying is, why if me and –  Like, we're two people who are into – it's like Bonnie and Clyde, man.  We are into what we're into.  Right.  But it's like Bonnie breaks protocol, Clyde breaks protocol where he shoots the cop first.  And she goes, I always want to shoot the cop first. 
[00:57:00]  But we're doing what we do.  But this time I messed up by shooting first.  But we're both shooters, man.  We're both out to kill.  Yeah, but you know what?  You're wrong because if you had just a girlfriend on the side, you wouldn't be having a threesome.  You found a girl that wants to have another girl.  You want three at one time or two at one time.  You wouldn't get that with just a girlfriend.  What are you talking about?  If you had just this new girl on the side, that wouldn't be a threesome.  Oh, see?  That's just another girl.  You're going laterally.  No, no, no, no.  You want to go up.  Wait a minute.  Time out, Vinny.  Time out, Mr. Family Everybody. 
[00:57:30]  All right?  You kiss your wife in the mouth the same way you kissed her ten years ago?  Yeah.  No.  Yes, I do.  Shut up, you liar.  You liar.  I'm sitting at kids every nine months.  Let me tell you something.  Nobody kidding.  Nobody.  How fine that girl is.  After a few years, man, you want a little strange.  I'm a fat hog.  I'm a mess naked.  I make me sick.  And my new house got big mirrors.  You're a mess dressed.  And my girl should not be in the bed.  She shouldn't be loving me this much. 
[00:58:00]  I'm telling you, man.  Hold on.  Save that rant for when we get back because we're late.  Damn.  Stay right there because we're not done with this.  By a long shot.  There's a lot of people calling up.  Threesomes are a disaster.  All women.  No, that's a guy.  All women.  It's a disaster because...  Wait.  Bruce in PA says threesomes are a disaster.  During Connecticut, some of us live just like Patrice.  So, just hold that thought.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Patrice O'Neal is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:58:30]  Hey, what's up?  Hey, man.  Listen to a little more from my wonderful threesome story.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  And you are enjoying the worst of the fellas.  Gregory Hughes and Anthony Cumia.  A.K.A. ONA.  A.K.A. Opie and Anthony.  A.K.A. fucking XM and serious greats.  Greats, A.K.A. bad motherfuckers.  A.K.A. not paying me for shit.  Anyway, enjoy the second half of my wonderful threesome story. 
[00:59:00]  I still jerk off to this.  You know how you have a jerk file?  This one is high up in there.  Enjoy.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  That last eight minutes could have been on the radio, but we had to play commercials.  Pal talkers heard it.  We're trying to do something for XM.  We're still waiting for the equipment to come in, but we're going to do a thing where  we start recording the stuff that happens during the commercials and then playing that stuff  back.  Yeah.  Because sometimes things happen. 
[00:59:30]  Oh, my God.  It sucks that we had to take a break there, but Patrice O'Neal is in the middle of an amazing  rant.  And a lot of people are saying that his rant is just like the rant I started with.  I'm talking about a dumb park a lot.  He's talking about a relationship, but it's pretty similar.  With trying to get a threesome together.  And it is the same thing.  It's personal entitlement.  You feel entitled.  But there's a difference, man.  The difference is this.  All right. 
[01:00:00]  Opie's like, hey, I can't get in this stadium.  This is making me sick.  It should not be like this.  I am angry about it.  All right, Opie, what are you going to do?  Nothing.  Nothing, but it should be better.  All right, Patrice.  I want to do threesomes.  Preferably have two girlfriends.  Mm-hmm.  All right.  Or basically one girlfriend and we have a girlfriend.  So your relationship has a girlfriend. 
[01:00:30]  Yes.  You and your chick, your girlfriend, have a girlfriend.  Have a girlfriend.  All right.  That's what I want.  Mm-hmm.  I am trying to make strides in doing that.  I am trying to make it happen because I think that.  You're trying to park closer to the stadium.  And only.  That's all I see.  I want parking space.  He wants VIP parking.  And your girl is at every single aisle waving you further from the stadium.  And you're trying to explain to her that you'll be happy if I'm closer to the stadium because I'll be happy. 
[01:01:00]  Because she's in the car with me.  And she's always going to.  She's riding with me.  So my happiness is happiness, man.  A woman's happiness is not based on anything except for trying to figure out how to be happy.  So if I'm happy and I have to cause her, I have to bring happiness to it.  I have to be happy so that I'm in this mood to give her this happiness, to give her what she needs. 
[01:01:30]  So how does this come into another girl dropping in and having sex with you too?  Because that makes me super happy.  And I'll have enough happiness to give two women now.  So you're using the Reagan's trickle-down economics.  Trickle-down, man.  With happiness.  Trickle-down, man.  Because a woman's happiness, she just so not.  She doesn't know what makes her happy.  She just.  Okay. 
[01:02:00]  Women go from place to place.  Specific to specific.  When me and my girl argue, I always try to argue the context of the entire thing.  But is she even allowed to argue with you?  Absolutely.  No, it doesn't seem like it.  I got a big mouth.  In Patrice's world, it seems like you shut your mouth and let me rule the whole place.  When I met her, when I met her, okay, I had a few women, okay?  She asked me, and I think I told you that she asked me how did she end up being my girl. 
[01:02:30]  And I said, because you hung around, you know, because you stayed in there.  You hung in there.  And what it is, it's like karate class.  And this is women.  This relationship's a disaster.  Karate class.  Oh, man.  It's like karate class, man.  It's like you meet.  Look, would you agree that men deal in numbers when it comes to relationships?  When we have to go find women.  We can't sit around and wait for women to come to us.  Right, right.  We have to actively go search.  Yeah, you got to go seek and destroy. 
[01:03:00]  It's like having a human resources department.  You may have the secretary you need, but she might leave your ass without two weeks' notice.  And see, you stuck.  What, your company going to go out of business?  So what happens is when I met my girl, I had six, about five or six girls that I had been in.  By the way, there's actually people out there saying you're full of ass.  Of course.  We know Patrice for a long time.  No, no, no, no.  He lives by different rules than most people.  I know there's a few out there also saying I live just like Patrice. 
[01:03:30]  Patrice, but in general, the average guy is not getting away with what Patrice is doing with his relationships and his life.  Did you ever think that your girl, your current girlfriend, just wants you and that's it?  She does.  But she's playing these little games to keep you happy, hoping that maybe someday you're going to give up on all this other crap and just settle down with her.  Can I tell you what my girlfriend is?  Yeah.  Let me tell you what she is.  All right.  She is a lesbian who is in love with me.  Hmm.  She hates men, but she loves me for whatever reason. 
[01:04:00]  Because I was the first dude to be into her without being sexual with her.  She would hang out with me.  I'd give her guidance.  She would go, don't I look good in this?  And I'm like, you look good, but you do.  You do, but I would be honest with her where other guys would lie to her to sleep with her just to sleep.  And she'd be like, well, why?  I'm a cool chick.  I do anything. 
[01:04:30]  I'm down.  I don't play sex games with nobody.  But why is these dudes not making me their girl?  And I was telling her why.  And as I was doing that, she was falling in love with me.  And I was just being frivolous.  So once I realized she was in love, I added her to the karate class.  And she happened to be, after I flip everybody, right?  And they go, I'm getting out of this class.  By the end of the thing, there's two girls left and they're both black belts.  One loses and she's just like out of here.  So now I have a black belt and she has a black belt in my crap because I can't feed her. 
[01:05:00]  So that's why I don't cheat on her.  Because if I go out and I go talk to some girl I just met and I give her a white belt, like lies.  Hey, baby, some old easy white belt, yellow belt.  Yeah.  I come back to my girl with white belt mentality.  I come back to her and I go, you know, hi-yah.  And she goes, she kicks me in the face and goes, I've never been able to kick you in your face that easy.  What you doing?  Talking to a white belt?  I got to stay focused with her.  Because she has a black belt in you.  She has a black belt in me. 
[01:05:30]  She knows I'm not, like, I was going to say jiving her.  But I ain't jiving her.  I'm not playing games with her.  And she's not doing this.  She's a soldier, man.  I went to Brazil with her.  She's not doing this for me.  She is definitely getting enjoyment.  She is a soldier.  All right, there's the answer.  I'm just asking.  Okay, okay.  Now I understand a little more about your relationship.  But now that's Brazil where, you know, you're paying for things.  There's a hooker out there that likes me.  She didn't like her.  I said, are you out of your mind?  You could have gave her $100. 
[01:06:00]  She would have took it.  You could have smacked her around and made her and say, yeah, you like my man, you whore.  Smack her upside the head.  She didn't think like she got.  Yeah, what's this don't like stuff?  You're paying.  She did.  She just.  There was a chick that just.  She was my play girlfriend out there.  Yeah.  And she had more than just, I want your money.  She was like, I want your money.  And I.  Who's this?  And my girl's like, who's this?  Oh, looking at you like.  She like you like that.  So she's getting into a third world horse when they give her that vibe. 
[01:06:30]  But the ones, the ones that don't give it as all she wants is not to be challenged, man.  And she won't be.  Let me ask you.  You're bringing another girlfriend.  Yeah.  That's what's going to happen.  Let me ask you.  I was just going to say that.  Now, this other girl comes in.  Your girl digs her because she's a lesbian that's in love with you.  You love the situation because now you got the two chicks.  But.  I got one chick.  You are.  Well, let me just say.  I got one chick.  And we have one chick.  And you have one chick.  Yeah, but she only gets two panties.  The other one gets four.  By your logic. 
[01:07:00]  By your logic.  Oh, I'm sorry.  By your logic.  You are so fantastic that this girl is going to have to fall in love with you.  Because you are a master of women.  You will understand this girl.  You will start treating her.  Here's the trickle down.  She will fall in love with you.  It can't be two queens, Anthony.  There's one queen.  So are you going to have them duke it out?  No.  My girl.  Death match.  My girl will guide her through.  Like, okay.  I love my nipples licked. 
[01:07:30]  Right?  All right.  Now.  Damn it.  That's just that ugly image.  We was in Brazil.  Can I go back to talking about parking lots?  Wait a minute, though.  We was in.  My girl's licking the nipple.  And there's another.  There's a hooker licking the other nipple.  Right?  Uh-huh.  And my girl looks at the hooker and taps her on the top of her head.  And goes.  To let her know that he likes.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So what'll happen is if we find us a girlfriend, my girl will trickle down what I like to her. 
[01:08:00]  I'm not going to have that much access to this.  So you're not even going to.  It's going to be all filtered through your chick.  She's going to have a little relationship daughter.  Everything else.  Filter through your chick.  Filter to your new chick.  Yeah.  And that way you don't have much contact with her.  So she can't fall in love with you.  But she will know to do your bidding through your real chick.  Yeah.  Patrice's main girlfriend will be like the manager.  And then the girl will be like a worker bee.  And she can tell her what.  Yeah, yeah.  And then Patrice can fire her through that manager. 
[01:08:30]  You're out of here.  You need a reality show, man.  Oh, hell yeah.  Your people should be freaking.  Are they crazy not having Patrice on a reality show?  They should be like pushing a reality show, Patrice O'Neal and his chick.  That would be a reality show I would watch.  I pitched it.  Because there's some honesty there.  I went to Comedy Central, pitched it, and my girl came to the thing.  And they looked at me like she came in.  Wow.  And looked at me like y'all would look at me.  You know, when I'm talking.  Yeah. 
[01:09:00]  And I'll go, look.  I'll go, look.  The show is going to be me, God and women, right?  But I have a girlfriend.  And all I'm doing is trying to find a woman that might, this could be my girlfriend if I was looking for one.  Go to VH1.  Go to VH1.  Go to Hustler or Playboy TV.  You can't go to Comedy Central.  Go to VH1.  Yeah, because this is no joke.  This is just very serious.  So this started with Patrice saying that you didn't get much sleep because you had the argument with your girlfriend because she found out you were talking to another girl. 
[01:09:30]  But you were talking to this other girl to bring her as a new girlfriend, but not as important as the main girlfriend.  She only gets two pairs of panties.  Your girlfriend that you love gets four.  She's always better.  So how did it end?  We had one of the best sessions we've ever had.  She would walk to the bathroom limping.  She would crawl to the bathroom.  We had one of the best sessions we've ever had where she gets tired, because I never get tired of arguing, and she got tired.  And when there's logic involved, because she feels how she feels. 
[01:10:00]  And so she was just saying, look, I feel how I feel.  I don't want you hanging out the perception that this is some other girl, and I look like a fool, and this, that, and the third.  And then I'm like, look, it's not going to happen.  My logic was why would I bring her?  It's too easy.  I'm just telling her, it's too easy to cheat.  It's too easy to cheat.  I'm not a nice guy with that particular situation. 
[01:10:30]  Yeah.  You know, I'll get a little side, but I got a girl that I don't want to, losing her is important enough, but still, if I'm going to sacrifice the fact that I like to go get strange.  You'd rather just have it all right on the table.  This is what I'm going to do, so I need this from you.  Yes, but I got lucky and found a soldier.  What the hell does she see in you?  I'm a trooper, man.  What the hell does she see in you? 
[01:11:00]  She is a free, she's free, man.  She's a, she's a free woman.  She's a lesbian, basically, so she doesn't, she doesn't like guys, but she loves you.  She loves me.  Why?  Because of your honesty?  Because I'm, because.  Because you take care of her bills, because you buy her nice things.  Because no one guides her, like every other woman who falls in love with me, I guide them.  I don't leave them hanging.  All right.  I told her, if we break up, man, some lucky man's going to get a good woman.  Some of you dudes out there, if I go, if you break up with your girl, I got to get her. 
[01:11:30]  I got to get a maniac, then I got to fix.  All right.  Now let's get back to, now let's get back to what you said about Vinny.  You said something else there that you don't kiss.  No one, look, man, my girl is lovely.  Vinny's wife is lovely.  Everybody got lovely women, man.  And after a few years, you cannot, it's scientifically impossible for you to kiss your wife.  Science is being brought in now.  I read a book.  Yeah.  No.  It's scientifically impossible to kiss your woman with that same, I just met you passion, if you've been with her for a few years. 
[01:12:00]  So you got to find ways to jack it up.  See, you got a family, Vinny, which, which kind of gives you that obligatory kind of, you know, I'm a, you're a dad, you know, you're a family man.  But you kiss your mom, your wife, like, like you just met her, don't lie, Vinny.  Well, you understand, with kids, I can't kiss her that often, so you're wrong.  When I get the kisser, it's fun.  Did you hear that?  Did you hear?  Yeah, because did you hear the roller skating he did?  Well, I have kids. 
[01:12:30]  Shut up, Vinny.  You don't understand that because you're not, there's something disconnected in you.  You're not a normal human being.  Yeah, that's why we love him.  We love you.  No.  We love the Patrice.  Go ahead, Vinny.  No, listen, you're not normal.  People don't like you when they meet you because you're not normal.  But you like me, Vinny.  I love you.  You like me wideo when you met me.  You know why?  Because it wasn't status quo.  It's like you meet some, some little intern in the elevator over at the Viacom building.  Hello, how's your morning?  How's it?  Shut up. 
[01:13:00]  It's six in the morning.  Why?  Why?  Because you are raping me with your niceness.  Why is my bitterness in the morning so bad?  Why is my bitterness different from your, hey, subjugate me with your fake, how you doing?  Listen, you lost me somewhere.  No, because you want to go, hello, how are you?  There's good morning.  Da, da, da.  And that's, that's status quo.  But I met you and said, look at you, you short idiot. 
[01:13:30]  And you go, but, but that's what kind of guy you really are, Vinny.  You're a guy who, who gives people, you mess with people all the time.  And, and, and, and, and you go, wait a minute, you had to get used to the fact like, that  we didn't go through the social contract.  And I'm, I'm, all I'm trying to do, this is what I'm trying to do, Opie.  I'm trying to eliminate the social filter and go from, this is how I feel, to saying it.  And sometimes it still gets blocked and choked in to the, the contract, but I just want 
[01:14:00]  to come up and say.  You're not going to get an argument from me.  We relate on that level.  Right.  I just want to say what I feel like saying.  And if, if my girl asked me, you know, you just want to be, be with two women and make  them two women, your girlfriend.  I go, yeah.  Well, yes, that's how I feel.  All right.  Wow.  You were asking me about the dumb parking lot.  What's the solution?  So what's the solution to keeping like the passion going in a relationship?  I think it's possible actually.  I really do.  You tell me.  So far, I'm beyond happy two years in. 
[01:14:30]  So, I mean, no, I, you know, so I'm not at that point.  I mean, Vinny's trying to say, how many years?  12 years.  12 years later that it's exactly the same, the kissing?  This is what I do.  Like the other day, now look, you're going to fucking jump.  No, I'm not.  You're going to jump over me.  Just listen to him and watch, watch this unravel.  All right.  You're going to jump over me because you're going to say, the other day I got up, I sent my  wife flowers just to send her flowers.  That keeps her happy.  That makes her happy.  She got the flowers.  Why'd you do that?  Because I love you.  That's why. 
[01:15:00]  That's how.  That's protocol.  Because you know you've got to court your wife.  All you have to do, OB, you've got to court your wife.  Look, I take care of myself.  I keep myself in good shape.  Yeah.  That's how I keep it fresh.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  You court.  It's not boring.  It's easy to court your wife.  It's a $7 million house, Vinny.  Wow.  You're really.  Wow.  It's easy when you live in a house where you can ride around in the house.  You have a roller coaster.  Right.  In your house, Vinny.  Wow.  You just gave all the guys out there a blueprint to keep their relationships going, Vinny. 
[01:15:30]  Give your wife flowers.  Flowers.  Flowers.  You know how that's hacky after a while.  I mean, sure, flowers are good, but you've got to do a little more than flowers.  It's not just flowers.  Just give her a credit card.  Tell her to spend the money.  You go fake.  Exactly.  That's what you do.  You can't get in a relationship and get bored.  What happens, Vinny, right, when the money, if the money runs flat, man, you've got no  guidance.  You've got to work.  You don't see.  You don't need guidance because you have enough money to just, that's the guidance.  You can buy her stuff. 
[01:16:00]  You can send her on her cruises.  You can do all that stuff.  But where's the guidance?  Where's, where's, you have to constantly figure out ways to buy her new stuff.  Oh, Vinny, thank you for a new, this is a diamond washing machine.  Thank you, Vincent.  And you said the same thing.  Four panties, two panties.  You're buying.  You said the same thing.  No, no.  You've got to keep her happy.  I don't, I don't keep her happy with buy.  I keep her happy with guidance because you know what?  What kind of guidance?  Here's what it is.  Once your girl, here's your guidance.  I'm bringing another girl.  Here's your hunt.  You train her how to lick my nipples. 
[01:16:30]  And you don't think that's exciting for her?  To train another broad?  You're going to mess up.  You're going to lose that girl because you're trying to have two girlfriends.  You're going to blow it off.  And here's the reason I'm not going to lose her because I'm trying to have two girlfriends.  I'm not trying to have one each.  You'll get bored with two and then you'll need two.  He's trying to have a girlfriend for his relationship.  Can I speak for Patrice?  I think I know him.  If he loses his girlfriend because she's not into the girlfriend with another girlfriend thing, right? 
[01:17:00]  Four panties, two panties.  So the other girlfriend's not as good as the main girlfriend.  And the main girlfriend leaves because of all this?  And Patrice's world is going to go, you know what?  She wasn't worthy of this anyway.  I'm back out there.  The dojo opens back up.  That's right.  I'm back out there.  And he trains another black belt.  In his mind, he believes this is how he wants to live.  And he also believes that he's going to make it happen.  Whether it's with this one that he's currently with or with someone that he hasn't even met yet.  So to answer your question, Vinny, if he does lose that girlfriend, he doesn't care in the end. 
[01:17:30]  Oh, I don't think Patrice cares.  He doesn't care in the end.  I don't think he cares at all.  He's going to go, you know what?  I don't think he cares about anything.  But I do.  I love my girl, man.  I love my girl.  I tell her, look, man.  Look, I love my girl.  I watch too much Maury Povich, right?  I love my girl 90% because I need 10% to think that she is garbage, meaning that she could cheat on me.  She could do something foul to me.  But I give her 90% of my love.  I need 10% for me to function so I can look through my files and human resources and get me some more secretaries, get me some more candidates. 
[01:18:00]  And it's not going to be easy, but I'm going to supplement.  That's your insurance policy.  My girlfriend fills up 90% of me.  90%, okay?  Maybe 80% because I'm trying to muscle another chicken.  So she fills me up 80%.  That means you figure if it was 10 women, 10 women.  It would take eight women.  Eight women to fill up the space sheet. 
[01:18:30]  So I would actively go out and find eight women to fill the void.  But you love this girl.  I love my girl.  Let me ask you something.  You love her.  She comes to you tomorrow and says, look, Patrice, I love you too.  I can't have a girlfriend for our relationship.  I say, fine.  And if you want to talk to her, I've said it to her.  I said, sweetie, last night I said, look, man, let me tell you what a trooper she is.  All right.  I said, look, and you think this is reverse psychology, but then I said, look, I don't  want no trouble.  Just, we'll cancel this, man.  I'm sorry.  When I was out of, and she said, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I'm just saying.  She wants a piece of this girl. 
[01:19:00]  She's sorry.  She was a hot mama.  A little Amazon, six feet, nice booty.  And Patrice almost has it all figured out.  You almost have this puzzle figured out.  But there's some pieces that got to be put, like, rearranged.  Is that it?  But Patrice's main girlfriend is more lesbian than straight, and that's what's making this  whole thing kind of work.  That's what's kind of making it work.  Patrice almost has this puzzle figured out completely.  Almost.  You're almost there.  Would you accept a show on XM where it's you and your chick trying to find a third girl?  Did you?  I mean, yeah, another girl in the relationship? 
[01:19:30]  No, because they'll just come out the woodworks, man.  It's the hunt.  It's the manipulation.  He doesn't want to, like, fish in a barrel.  He's got to go out.  I've got to find a trooper.  He likes the game.  It's the game.  Yeah.  Finding a trooper, man, is exciting.  That's the game, friend.  All right, listen, we've got to get one person that agrees with Vinny.  There's one out there.  James in Oklahoma.  One.  James.  What's going on, guys?  Hey.  I've been married 17 years.  Got four kids.  Still have sex three, four times a week. 
[01:20:00]  Oh, he's really selling his life.  Listen to him.  He's sounding like there's a razor blade to his throat right now.  I'm 17.  Listen to you, man.  Let me copy how you sound.  I'm 17 years, man.  Four kids.  I love her.  We've been doing this radio show a really long time.  I can tell you what's going on right now.  His wife is in the passenger seat.  You call him.  You call him.  You know you're happy.  It's been 17 years.  You get on the phone and defend our long relationship.  I love the show, but this isn't necessarily the show you should gauge relationships on. 
[01:20:30]  Oh, we had a big fight three days ago.  All right.  Well, I'm telling you, man.  It comes and it goes, man.  We have seen that, though, where all of a sudden a guy will call up and be like, hey, that's  pretty cool.  And then you find out that his wife is going to work with him.  You call that show because we've been together and I want people to know that you could be  together for 17 years and it could still be allowed.  This is the radio show you listen to?  Well, you call them right now.  He's calling from his minivan with his car seats in the back.  And, sir, sir, if you're in the car listening, two things you ask yourself. 
[01:21:00]  If she left you, what would you really miss?  Oh, my God.  Jesus.  And, two, if you told her how it was, where would she go and what would she do?  She can't get another you.  You can get another her easy.  That's what I'm talking about.  You're not a normal person.  Wow.  I love this guy.  If your woman left you, Vinny, she could not find another dude to take with another 
[01:21:30]  beauty.  Vinny, I haven't been to your house.  Vinny has the best house I've ever seen in my entire life.  Me, personally.  I haven't been to.  All right.  Yeah, we've got to take a break.  Can she find another you easier than you can find another her?  You tell me that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah, listen, she's listening.  Yes, she could.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Patrice O'Neill is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  This is Patrice O'Neill, and you're listening to the worst of the great Opie and Anthony, 
[01:22:00]  hosted by me.  And I told you my name already.  All right, youngsters, sit back and enjoy the final little chapter of my threesome story.  Oh, it's delicious.  It's delicious.  And all you racist white guys, just pretend the girl's white so you can do something with  it.  It could be you, too.  Pieces of shit.  Jesus.  White guys can't appreciate nothing.  I don't like that fucking black pussy.  Really?  Faggots.  Anybody even...  Pussies should never be racial.  Pussies, pussy. 
[01:22:30]  Goddamn, bitches.  Enjoy.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neill.  Wow.  Man, it doesn't stop during the breaks.  Patrice just keeps going on and on, just with all this knowledge and wisdom of relationships  that is from the planet Krypton because it's nothing that can work here on Earth.  If for some reason, I think it's our oxygen, nitrogen atmosphere that just screws this whole 
[01:23:00]  plan of yours up.  Maybe you got to go to like Venus because you are just talking fantasy world.  It can happen.  Whatever you're talking about, let me tell you.  There's somebody out there living it more than I want to.  No.  Whatever you're talking about is possible.  It can happen.  But it's the after effect, the repercussions, these things, you're making it sound like  you do this and then it follows up with this. 
[01:23:30]  You do this, it's like, all right, we got to clear out a spot here to build a house on.  So let me nuke it and then I'm going to build a house without thinking it's going to be irradiated  for 8,000 years.  You're like, well, it cleared the ground and now it's clear.  When you look at it like that.  That's pretty funny.  You, like your plan is good up until the repercussion point.  We're just asking, you're kind of assuming too much on, you're planning too much on what 
[01:24:00]  this girl that you're bringing in is going to be all about.  Don't forget one basic thing, that I am not putting on her to know anything.  I am guiding.  Right.  I am driving.  But you're not going to get an empty vessel.  So what will happen is, here she has two choices.  She ride or she gets out.  That's what I was saying earlier.  We asked a question during the break about your, can we say? 
[01:24:30]  Go ahead, man.  I don't know what you want to air or not.  It's fine, man.  But basically, your girl.  I'm not going to say a name, you know what I'm saying?  But she's a good girl.  Yeah, basically a girl.  We asked if your girl's been with another dude and if that bothers you.  And then you said, what?  I've seen her pop another dude.  Yeah.  I've seen her with another guy.  We went to a swing joint and I was, because of what I wanted to do, I had to.  There was no logic.  It would have just been pure hypocritical to say, you can't sleep with another dude. 
[01:25:00]  I didn't even want to put that in my head to say that.  So I said, okay, we're going to do this.  And what happened is the dude, what happens is when you're swapping, you know, when you're  swinging, you know, you're going, he goes in with his girl and I go in with my girl.  We go and we start with each other.  You just get the sex vibe going.  And we kind of, you know, switch, you know, trade up, switch up.  And he was very gentle with my girl. 
[01:25:30]  She liked him.  No funny, no strange fingers, no weird action.  And she, she, she nailed him like a soldier.  He was very good to her.  And I was very good to his girl.  Hey, when you're in these situations.  All right.  Now, I'm thinking like, what is it?  You're just sitting, standing there watching.  When you're in these situations and people look at you, oh, damn, that's Patrice O'Neal  from Web Junk.  Do you get recognized in those situations? 
[01:26:00]  Whatever.  Like most people that watch, I mean, look, most of the people, my fans are more the fans  of this show and my fans like from HBO or something than Web Junk.  Web Junk people are like little kids and the teenagers.  Yeah.  But a lot of those college boys, they crazy, man.  And they just know me.  I'm honest, man.  That's why I got Web Junk.  It's like, I'm trying to be honest, as honest as I can.  Well, you absolutely are.  I'll give you that much.  Somebody might call me out and I might have lied about something.  So I might have, you know, I've got these girls out there that mush my heart. 
[01:26:30]  A couple when I was young.  And you just learn.  You live and you learn.  And my happiness, I just want to be happy.  It must have been a hell of a mushing.  What's wrong with some happiness?  It must have been a hell of a mushing because you have gone like in a wacky direction, Patrice.  All right, let's go to what?  Nothing wrong with your happiness.  Yeah, let's go to Jerry in Connecticut.  Jerry.  Hey, boys, what's up?  Hey.  Is this my boy?  Patrice.  Hey, man.  What's up, man?  This guy's a trooper when I was doing a Black Phillip.  This is my boy.  You know this guy?  He's on my top eight. 
[01:27:00]  Never took him off because he's living it.  Tell him, Jerry.  Listen, boys.  I've been living.  I've been married for 10 years, two kids, and I got a girlfriend living in a house for  the last nine years.  There you go.  What?  Nine years.  Vinny, you got a 10,000 square foot house.  You can't have another girlfriend in there running around?  I'm thinking you might find her eventually.  Who's that?  I keep seeing that girl. 
[01:27:30]  Just a fleeting glimpse down a hallway somewhere along corridor.  This guy's a soldier, man.  She live upstairs like, what's the thing from Pulp Fiction?  The Gimp.  She upstairs.  They don't, him and his wife.  I remember the whole thing.  His wife, the girl and the wife have a little thing going.  He doesn't care that they mess around without him.  You know why this works?  Let me tell you why this works.  Because Jerry is like one step away from serial killer.  Like, it's got to be.  No, he's a black guy.  We don't serial kill.  Well, the mentality is that of a serial killer. 
[01:28:00]  How can you say that?  Because it's so out there.  He's got a kept woman in the attic.  No, she's not kept.  They know each other.  They hang out together.  They watch movies together.  Thank you, Jerry.  Shopping together?  You're like a Mormon.  Four panties and two, baby.  You're like a Mormon then in the old days.  No, he's happy.  Happy.  Very happy.  How did the fight happen in that house?  Like, in other words, does you ever get like two girls, they ever argue with you?  The two of them?  Team up?  Double the bitching? 
[01:28:30]  Gotta.  Well, yeah, but I straighten that out.  That comment, I straighten that out.  Why is that a serial killer, man?  Why?  It's just some kind of weird mentality.  Why?  No, I'm exactly, exactly what Patrice is saying is exactly the way it is.  It just doesn't seem to.  I train both of them.  I train both of them.  I train them.  See, training, it's this.  He's raising a good bitch.  He's raising his girl.  And you know what?  Neither one of them would leave if I asked them to. 
[01:29:00]  Why did you marry the one?  Did you know the other one before you got married?  I did know her, but we weren't sexually involved.  And then after one year of marriage, you got this girl moved into your house?  Well, we started having sex first, so probably two years or so in the house.  Just you and her, or are you her and the wife?  Me and the wife were living together.  We started having sex with my girlfriend, and then within two or three years, she moved  into the house.  Delicious.  That's my plan, too. 
[01:29:30]  I just got to house myself, Jerry.  It has a nice attic.  Oh, man.  Oh, man.  And does she come to you and say, like, I need money for, you know, something or clothes?  No, we just started living together, and I started taking care of her.  I bought her a new car.  I bought her.  What does the third person get out of this?  That's what I don't get.  A new car.  I can see what you get.  I can see what the wife gets.  The girl, you know, in the attic with the chain around her ankle, what does she get  in the head?  She gets a fulfillment, man, that she's not going to get. 
[01:30:00]  He has enough guidance to lead two women.  He can guide these women to something that they, that virile feeling that they don't understand.  If you ask them why they love Jerry, they won't be able to tell you because there's some  kind of weird nature happening.  You don't think she's waiting for the wife to, like, die or something?  Oh, yeah, after 10 years?  Of course, yeah.  She's been slowly poisoned, like, like flowers in the attic. 
[01:30:30]  She's been giving him arsenic in the cookies.  He's a trooper.  Why can't you understand that?  I'm trying to understand this.  I can't understand it.  Let me, let me, does this, that you have kids?  Yeah.  You have kids?  And you got kids.  What do they call her?  Aunt, what's her name?  Aunt whore?  Aunt whore?  Ah, what, Jerry?  They just call her by her regular name.  And what are you, how old are your kids?  One's 11 and one is 7.  All right, and what do they think about this relationship? 
[01:31:00]  What are they being told?  She's the nanny.  No, it's perfectly normal to them.  They don't.  Wait, wait, it's perfectly normal.  How much do they know about this relationship?  I've had my kids go, is that your new girlfriend when I have a girl come over the house?  Who goes to back to school night?  Yeah, who goes to the PTA meeting?  Look at Vinny, that's all he cares about.  I can't understand that.  He can't wrap his.  You do understand it.  He can't wrap his arms around this in any way.  Jerry, man, I'm sorry I left us hanging.  One of these days. 
[01:31:30]  So who goes to laundry?  And if I bring flowers home, who gets what?  Yeah, are there shared duties?  Dude, do they?  And Jerry's not a, Jerry doesn't, it's not like, hey, baby, and then if they get out of line, I'm gonna smack him in the top of the chops.  I don't, I never touch my girl.  I'm threatening my girl, man.  None of that, man.  It's a guidance.  It's a thing.  It's, it's tapping into this thing where she's just looking at you, man.  Like, look, this is so sexy.  I've seen, look, I've seen TV shows about, uh, uh, Mormons and people that are into polygamy and stuff like that, and the women are always a little screwy in the head. 
[01:32:00]  Stepford.  They, they, they, yeah, they're like, I'm sorry, which woman do you know that's not screwy in the head?  I'm sorry.  No, in a different way.  I'm talking, they're a little, like, like, way out there, uh, a little screwy in the head as far as, like, their, their relationship with the man is very submissive, very submissive, and they have a relationship with each other, like, almost sisterly, and, uh, Patrice isn't saying anything wrong. 
[01:32:30]  He's, he's like, yeah, and this is great.  So, they're not actual, they're not real women.  They're, they're, they're puppets.  They're, they're Stepford wives.  Why?  Why?  Because there's two of them.  So, if he, yeah, because they.  If he did the same thing with his one wife.  You're not getting a loving relationship from.  Is he, are you loving, Jerry?  Uh, he's, he's on hold, because I wanted to go to Joe. 
[01:33:00]  You're not getting a real loving relationship.  You're getting sex from two different women.  How do you know what you're getting?  Have you ever done it?  How do I know?  Wait a minute, Anthony, have you ever done it?  You is, now, for what I understand.  I pay through the nose every three months because of it.  Yeah.  Why do you think I got divorced?  I'm saying, but did you experience any of this action with your old wife?  Did you find out if this is wrong?  Didn't I just explain everything?  Do you think I'm talking out my ass about this whole thing?  Did you do a threesome with your wife? 
[01:33:30]  I am so experienced that.  Of course I did.  All right.  I know everything.  What happened?  What happened?  I write huge checks every three months.  You got divorced because of a threesome?  That was part of it.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  What's the threesome, was it?  Yeah.  That was the straw that broke the camel's back.  There was a lot going on.  Joe and Jersey.  That was the one where, when the questioning came about in the courtroom and I would watch  the news and the post reporters there, I said, let's go in the back and settle this  immediately. 
[01:34:00]  Joe, what's up?  I just want to say, Patrice sounds exactly like every cult leader I've ever heard.  Cult leader.  That's enough.  I'm sorry.  I said serial killer.  I meant cult leader.  That is absolute.  Bravo, sir.  Cult leader.  You're a cult leader.  He's got nothing to say.  He's been found out.  Look at him.  Wow.  That's right.  He's proud of that, though.  Because once he swings two, do you think it's going to stop?  That's right.  The hunt is going to go, like, stop there? 
[01:34:30]  He's going to then go, you know, if I could get three girls.  And I got some poison Kool-Aid waiting for a hole right now.  The FBI is going to be lobbing grenades through your window.  No, they're not.  They're going to be joining me for dinner.  Come on in.  Come on in, Lieutenant.  Have a little piece here.  He doesn't seem to be hoarding weapons.  He's hoarding bitches.  Is there a law against this?  Officer, put that down.  Come on in.  Let's go to Edward in Queens.  Edward, you want to have her over there?  Go ahead. 
[01:35:00]  Edward, parking lot Y.  I can't believe it.  Good morning.  Yeah.  It all started with parking lot Y, by the way.  Let's remember that.  Fair enough.  All right, Edward.  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, gentlemen?  What's up, man?  Yo, Patrice, I've been married for about nearly six years now.  I love this woman to death, but I want to get away from her now.  Yeah.  And you know what will keep you from not getting...  Because you're not sexually explosive towards her no more.  And so now you're figuring that it's getting bad because you're not sexually feeling the way you used to. 
[01:35:30]  That's because innately we need...  Look, God don't make mistakes.  There's five or ten women born to every one guy.  Because God knows we will sleep with five or ten women to keep this world going.  All you got to do, man, is talk to her and say, look, I just need...  Here's what...  You go to a swing club.  Go to La Trapeze, man, right?  And let me tell you what it'll do.  La Trapeze.  Where's that?  I don't know where it is, but it's...  Just look it up.  It's very...  It's not one of those...  It's not one of those things where you knock and say, Joe sent me.  You can go in.  And here's the thing, dude. 
[01:36:00]  Let me tell you what you need to do.  You need to watch another guy want your woman.  And you will be excited again.  And she needs to watch another woman want you.  And y'all will want each other again.  It will last an extra five more years of excitement.  Because you're living this married life of what you're supposed to be living.  If you go out and you find strange guys that want to pop your wife,  you're going to be like, ooh, I want her.  Patrice, that can't be done like you're talking about one extreme. 
[01:36:30]  Can't that be done at a mall?  Right.  Can't that be done with her looking real good walking around and guys look at her?  No.  No, because it's going to be filtered from the other guys.  You got to take her someplace where the protocol is some dude in a towel  and his chick with her breasts hanging out say, listen, your girl is gorgeous.  And you go, yours is too.  And y'all go in a room and you watch some other dude want your woman.  Well, it's a little further than want. 
[01:37:00]  He's getting.  Hey, well, what are you going to do?  Can't have everything.  And I'm telling you, that'll spark y'all up, dude.  I'm telling you.  Oh, Jesus.  No, I'm not lying to you, man.  I'm telling you.  We're talking animal stuff here.  We're not talking.  Let's get socially.  Let's clear our minds.  Vinny, are you taking notes over there or what?  I'm listening.  I'm going to try and sell it to my wife tonight.  Let's clear our minds socially, man.  Let's just clear the social contract.  Let's talk about animal.  Let's talk about what you feel, man.  I don't know what you feel, but whatever you feel, you just aren't into her. 
[01:37:30]  And, you know, you're a good guy and you love her, but you're questioning yourself.  You're going, why?  You know what?  I'm going to tell you why I feel like this now.  Because for the last month, it's just been beefing, beefing, beefing.  And last week, we got into a fight so bad that I locked out of the house and she had  me committed for the night.  You're done, dude.  Get out of it.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Don't get out of it.  This is your fault, dude.  It's your fault because that's what they do.  You have to guide them.  You have to let them know anything crazy she does. 
[01:38:00]  You have to dismiss it with logic, man.  You have to beat her down with logic.  I'm telling you, man, your marriage isn't over.  She's got some thing where girls get a little like, I need excitement.  Let me tell you something.  Any emotion isn't emotion for a woman.  Hatred is the same thing as love for them.  If a girl hates me, I know I can get her because I'll flip it over.  It's yin and yang, man.  Flip your wife.  I'm telling you.  Hate is love.  Work is freedom.  I love it all.  I'm telling you, man. 
[01:38:30]  Dude, don't give up, man.  I'm telling you, man, try that out, man.  Because let me tell you, she's got to throw this one back.  She cannot.  Yeah.  You're letting people out of the house.  Let me tell you something.  You're not going to find a woman who won't do that.  You've got to make every woman you with, you've got to make her into your girl.  Your wife is your wife, Vinny.  If she left you, she'd have to become someone else's wife.  And I don't mean just I do. 
[01:39:00]  She has to know what makes you mad, what makes you happy, and she has to care about  what makes you mad and what makes you happy.  His wife doesn't care because she thinks he doesn't care, so she's doing dumb stuff for  drama to get attention.  And that's your fault because you started off like that.  If you're going backwards, it's hard to turn around, man.  But now you've got to start turning around and you've got to take an L.  Patrice wants every guy out there to be a pimp.  This is like pimp mentality.  But not hit your wife or put her on the avenue.  So what's he supposed to do now? 
[01:39:30]  Let's see.  Here's an example.  She walks up to him and, you know, what the hell did you do?  You didn't vacuum the floor.  This place is up.  You know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  She's bitching.  What's he supposed to do now after six years of taking that?  Bring home a new girlfriend.  Apparently.  What haven't you been listening to?  Apparently.  What am I, stupid?  I know.  The answer was right in front of me.  Somebody wants to call your cult, Cult 45, by the way.  He doesn't have a name, but he did it from his cell phone. 
[01:40:00]  Can I have that for the book, Cult 45?  Some girl from Austin.  I watched my husband F2 women on Saturday, and he still F'd me when he got home.  This does happen in real life, and Patrice can get what he wants easily.  Many couples we know have a girlfriend.  Delicious.  God bless.  God bless.  It's a big world.  A lot of people out there.  A lot of people.  Go to Adult Friend Finder.  Oh, here it is.  Wait.  Go to Pal Talk on whatever lonely room and watch some broad somewhere taking her boobs out just to be loved. 
[01:40:30]  I've seen it on Pal Talk, yeah.  Mammy Pellegrosso.  Let's go to Paul in Brooklyn.  Paul.  Hey, what's up?  You got people joining your cult like crazy, by the way.  Yeah, man.  They're calling in.  Yeah, Paul.  Hey, he was talking about that place, Lodger Peas.  It's in there.  Delicious.  Another soldier.  Another soldier.  Paul, what's this place about?  Hey, you know, the place is what it is, just like he says, you go there, you have to go in there with a woman, 
[01:41:00]  or if you're a single woman, you can get in.  Yeah, no guys just walking in.  Hey, I want to screw somebody.  Well, hey.  I got nothing to trade.  Yeah.  I want to pick someone up on waivers, if you don't mind.  So, you go in, you bring a chick.  Right, but the deal is with me, I'm married, and the girl I go with is married. 
[01:41:30]  I know her husband.  She knows my wife.  So, but her and I get together, and we go there, and then we swap with other couples, and then we go back to our perspective for others.  It's like, you know, whatever, and we just have a good time.  It's hard to explain.  It is.  You got too many others in there.  I couldn't.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay, here's the one thing, though.  Do your wife and her husband know?  No, of course not.  So, then it's a little bit, you're kind of cheating with each other, but here's the thing. 
[01:42:00]  Listen to this.  Let's boil this down.  All right.  Let's boil this down.  He is cheating on his wife, and he still needs extra booty.  Do you understand what I'm saying?  Guys.  Wait, are you sleeping with the other guy's wife?  Or are you just taking her out and swapping her?  Yeah.  Because you know why?  Because he's a winner, and this other woman's a winner, and they're with two people that goes,  his wife goes, and her husband goes, no.  And they both ran into each other and went, hey, let's do something crazy. 
[01:42:30]  It's still not enough.  Let's swap with each other, too.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  Let's go down there and swap each other.  He's just using another swap.  I could get a lot more for you than I can for my wife.  Come on.  You're what I could get for you.  You know what else is great?  Yeah.  She loves other women, too.  Jesus.  She's all over the place.  Do you hear how happiness?  Wait a minute.  Time out.  Do you hear how elated this guy is to talk? 
[01:43:00]  He sounds like a straight, lazy dude, right?  Did you hear Mr. I Love My Wife, 17 years, four kids?  He sounded like death warmed over.  He sounded like he was praying for cancer.  He sounded like he was practicing to have cancer.  Night of the Living Dead.  I Love My Wife.  Four kids.  And everybody throws their four kids and everything.  Like, that's the validation for your misery.  This dude's like, dude, I'm cheating on my wife. 
[01:43:30]  I love it.  I love my best friend.  And we're swapping.  He's putting her to the swingers club.  He's happy to get this out.  It was like a sickness on his soul.  He gets to say it and not be judged because I'm in his corner.  Go get him, Tiger.  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  All right.  Later, guys.  Ladies and gentlemen.

But you can check me out on Twitter, too, on Big Mama Prods.  I'm at Big Mama Prods.  And you spell mama M-O-M-M-A, not M-A-M-A.  You understand what I'm saying? 
[01:44:30]  Hey, what's up?  This is the best of Opie and Anthony, hosted by your friend,  the one you can trust, Mr. Patrice O'Neal.  And this particular story, if you remember, Ludacris was on,  and this is when he was referring to himself as,  I am the actor Christopher Sumrard thing, and I am the rapper Ludacris.  I really love the motherfucker.  Still do love his music, but boy, it's Hollywood will get you every time, man.  God damn, how much money do you need? 
[01:45:00]  Somebody give me $10 million, I'll drop right off the planet Earth, nigga.  I ain't going to sit here.  I'm going to be like, I'll say anything I feel.  If I had $10 million in my pocket, $20 million?  Hey, Patrice, what you think of this guy?  He can suck my dick.  Hey, Patrice, what you think of this one?  I don't know.  Eat my asshole.  I'll say anything.  Money equates to truth.  Do you understand?  Do you get it?  No?  All right.  Never mind.  I think I'm getting a little too excited.  All right.  Anyway, enjoy the fucking bit, man. 
[01:45:30]  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  The Opie and Anthony show, Patrice O'Neal in studio, and Chris Ludacris Bridges has made  his way into the studio.  Yes, yes.  You want people to start calling you Chris, right?  Man, you know, for the movies, of course, Chris Bridges, Ludacris is a character within  himself.  So, you know, every movie part, I don't want to be like, hey, that's Ludacris.  Yeah.  So, of course, you know, we're just making sure we're keeping it all the way professional.  Uh-oh.  That means he's retiring from rap.  No, that's not.  It's gone. 
[01:46:00]  It's done.  He's fading out the Ludacris.  Oh, it's over.  He's fading that out.  You're going to start doing any movies where you're in SUVs with a bunch of kids going  across the country or something like that?  I mean, you never know.  You never know.  Get a little RV action.  Yeah, something like that.  Don't do that, please.  I know.  I'm just messing with you.  Keep it real stops once you make a few mil.  Is that it?  Like, all of that just is...  Let me ask you a question, Chris.  Am I going to say Chris or Ludacris?  Yeah, it don't matter.  I know he was Ludacris. 
[01:46:30]  It's all good, man.  You can call me Ludacris.  What is the thing, because I'm sure you grew up hood, what is the thing that, since you've  been successful in the world, that you go, man, I would have never thought I'd be deeply  into this, where you go, boy, I would have called me a sellout.  Do you understand?  No, no, no.  Wait, listen to me.  I eat...  Coming from where I'm from, eating raw fish sushi, I try to get my friends to eat sushi  and they just look at me like that.  Oh, I see what you're saying.  You feel what I'm saying?  Like, where you go, uh-oh, like you get your toes done or you do something where you go, 
[01:47:00]  oh, man, what am I doing?  You know, I definitely never thought I would be as bougie as, like you're saying, like eating  certain foods and stuff like that.  Things that I never thought I'd like, sushi is definitely one of them.  But, yeah, I feel you on that.  But, I mean, one thing that I sit there and say I've always wanted and I go down my driveway  in Atlanta, Georgia every time and just, like, thank God, it's like 22 acres of land, 15,000  square feet of house.  And that just kind of, like, blows my mind every time.  I mean, every time I go down my driveway. 
[01:47:30]  So it's a beautiful thing.  Damn, I don't doubt it.  We were talking about the election and me and Patrice are constantly at odds on this whole  thing.  It seems to be more class against class on this thing.  Now, you've obviously made a few bucks.  We've been blessed to have made a few dollars.  And it seems like we're going to be the people that might take the brunt of this tax hit if  Obama gets it.  Wait, wait, wait.  Why?  What is this tricky white way to lead him to be us class? 
[01:48:00]  Why don't you ask him what he thinks before you say, hey, we're against this.  Because I'm not putting color to him.  I'm not going to let you do this.  He's got an angle.  I like that.  I like Anthony's angle.  This is cleverness.  I see where you're going with it, man.  My thing is that everybody gets out there and votes and just makes their voice heard for  the next four years of our lives.  That's what's extremely important.  Do you want to pay more taxes?  Do I want to pay more taxes?  I don't think anyone wants. 
[01:48:30]  Some tells me when you're writing that check, you feel a lot like me.  That handshakes.  I don't think anyone wants to pay more taxes, man.  But of course, we all play a very big part in trying to change our lives for the better.  So whatever we have to do in order to make that happen, everybody's going to have to  make sacrifices, basically, is what I'm saying.  It's just about sacrifices.  Which means, that says right there, the black president.  Listen to you.  Look, he has a career and things.  I'm telling you. 
[01:49:00]  I'm going to tell you what a person with a career, a black person with a career talk  is.  We have to make sacrifices.  He doesn't want to do it, but we have to make sacrifices.  We all got to do it.  We all got to make them.  Which means the black president.  Do you want to make some sacrifices, my friend?  There you go.  There we go.  That's what I'm talking about.  Good question, Chris.  I'll be honest with you.  I make giant sacrifices.  That's great.  Well, then there you have it.  I'm already making sacrifices.  I just don't want to make more sacrifices.  By pressing that button that says me. 
[01:49:30]  Negro.  It's not pressing the Negro button.  Boy, is that a sacrifice.  I know you've got copper tunnel syndrome in both wrists.  You are an ass, Patrice.  Anthony is the guy in Crash that sold the girl the gun.  There you have it.  That's pretty much it, right?  Speaking of movies, man, you know.  Max Payne.  Ah, yes.  You got myself, Mark Wahlberg, Mila Kunis, Bo Bridges.  It's loosely based off the video game, you know, for all the gamers out there. 
[01:50:00]  But I guarantee you, if you've never played a video game or know about it, you're still going to walk away from this experience very satisfied.  The movie is ludicrous.  I was psyched when I heard they were even making this when I first heard that because I'd played the game.  Right.  Very cool, very, like, creepy, eerie kind of a thing going on.  And, yeah, how does the movie compare to the game, like the character himself?  Man, honestly, it's like the game is one thing.  But it's like the movie, it's loosely based off the game, but it takes it to a whole other level. 
[01:50:30]  So, you know, the cinematography is stylized.  It has that kind of film noir feeling, you know, that dark Matrix-type feel.  But, you know, the storyline, a man that his family's brutally murdered and he's out to seek revenge and he's definitely destroying anything in his pathway to find out who killed his family.  It's a great story, my friend.  So I think you'll definitely enjoy it, especially if you played the video game.  And you are in the movie?  Jim Bravura.  So do you remember Jim Bravura from the video game?  Jim was his little buddy that would help him out every so often. 
[01:51:00]  Not really.  No idea who Jim Bravura is.  Jim Bravura, internal affairs agent.  So it was actually written in for a 60-year-old white man.  I went and auditioned for the part, man, and the director called me two days later and told me I had it.  So, you know, I'm in there, man.  They still make you read for parts?  Sometimes.  Sometimes, you know, just to make sure that, you know, you do a screen test so that you go up against certain people, you know, make sure everything's right.  Make sure the chemistry's out.  Exactly.  And the good thing is I don't die in the first one as the black man, so it's a very beautiful thing.  There's room for me to come back if there's a sequel. 
[01:51:30]  It's a beautiful thing.  What do you think it is about hip-hop artists that make it, the transition to film so easy?  Like, a lot of good actors have come out of rap.  Well, I mean, you got to think that when we write our own music, of course.  So, you know, that's kind of like our emotion on paper, and then we do it visually on video.  So when we do videos, it's already a form of acting in our own character and basically the things that we've written down, like I said, as far as music is concerned.  So it's a good transition.  Half of it is being comfortable in front of the camera, in my opinion. 
[01:52:00]  But I think that's why so many artists, you know, they make that transition because they're already doing a form of it anyway.  It's just about taking on different characters.  Now, is the change in the name, we're going back to your, like, Chris Ludacris Bridge, is that more the studio?  Because, like, 50 Cent's doing the same thing.  He's being billed as, like, you know, a Curtis, 50 Cent Jackson, and it seems like a lot of the rappers, they're trying to get to use it.  Is that a studio thing?  No, that's something that I'm trying to do personally.  It's just because, like I said, Ludacris is a character all within himself.  So, you know, that's the music side.  And when I'm Chris Bridges, it's me taking on other characters, of course. 
[01:52:30]  Satisfied Jim Douche Norton?  Why?  It's a good question, Anthony Alitascomia.  How much did Bill O'Reilly cost you in 2002?  Oof.  He probably made me more money, so thanks to Bill O'Reilly.  Yeah, in the end, he made you a lot of money.  Absolutely.  We were just talking about boycotts yesterday on our show because, you know, we're threatened with boycotts from time to time and, you know, the special interest groups.  What do you think of that whole thing with Pepsi getting rid of you?  Like I said, man, it was a learning experience. 
[01:53:00]  It made me want to learn more about how businesses can even do things like that.  So I take adversity and I make it a positive.  You know what I'm saying?  I think that's what life is all about.  But for them to just go and just get rid of it just like that, you know, without even, like, hanging in there and seeing what develops, it just amazes us that corporations will do that.  Believe me, it amazed me when it happened, too.  But, I mean, like I said, at the end of the day, I got life.  Life goes on.  And, you know, you just keep moving and you make sure that you stay successful so that at the end of the day, it was just like a speed bump in my life. 
[01:53:30]  But, you know, you need some adversity sometimes in order to become a stronger person.  At the time, though, it's a lot more than just, you know, a speed bump when stuff like that happens because you're kind of going, what is this about?  Like, this dummy, Bill O'Reilly, gets on and just starts lambasting you about, you know, why is Pepsi hiring him?  Here's what he does.  But it's like, you know, it's a lot more when you dwell so much on the past and stop thinking about the future. 
[01:54:00]  That's what it is.  I'll be honest with you.  Let's think about what's to come and forget about what happened.  Unfortunately, that stuff is still happening.  Yeah, that's why we bring it up.  We're very passionate about it.  I think boycotts work.  Yeah, like people are all of a sudden going to stop drinking Pepsi.  No, Pepsi is, you know, yeah, right.  All right.  What about the Oprah thing, 2006?  That was a very long time ago, but what would you like to know about that?  Let's keep the adversity going. 
[01:54:30]  What about it?  That was a general statement.  But you've been involved in some, you know, very controversial things that are worth talking about.  We've never talked to you about them.  Oprah didn't want to empower rappers and doesn't believe in rappers and hip hop.  I mean, you know, that's pretty crazy.  I mean, what do you want me to say, my friend?  Well, just your, I guess your thoughts on it.  Yeah, I guess you could say my thoughts on it is that some people can have a disagreement.  You can agree to disagree.  So that's basically what it comes down to.  You don't want to piss off Oprah?  No one does.  No. 
[01:55:00]  All right.  She's very powerful.  I've openly voiced my opinion about the whole entire subject, and that's what I'm doing now.  So, you know.  Yeah.  No, it's not about keeping controversy going.  It's like a lot of times these things happen, and they're frustrating to watch from the outside.  It's frustrating to see, especially when I see other artists getting attacked.  It's really irritating, and they're getting attacked on content.  And when I see the corporations buckler, I see someone like Oprah, who's an artist who made it, attacking it.  It's aggravating to watch.  And it's like, you know, we don't get to talk to a lot of the guys until, unfortunately, two years later.  And it is something that people still associate. 
[01:55:30]  Like, this radio show has gotten in trouble, and it's annoying.  People still associate it with a lot of the problems it's had.  Man, it's all good.  Y'all got to do your job, man.  It's all good.  I'm here to answer whatever questions you want me to ask.  We've seen a lot of really good radio shows, you know, go away because of dumb things.  And, you know, that's all.  It's very important to us, you know.  For her not to, you know, be into rappers is ridiculous.  But you hit back musically, too.  On Bill O'Reilly, you hit back, which is nice.  Yeah, I mean, you know.  It's satisfying artistically to be able to take a swing and do it in the right context, which is through your work. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, I mean, artistically, I voice my opinion through my music sometimes, and that's what, you know, we do.  And, of course, he voices his opinion on his show, so we all have our own formats of doing things.  Right.  Same way this radio show has their own format of doing things.  You know, let's all keep our jobs.  Yeah, that seems to be the goal.  That's what it comes down to.  Yeah, we try.  But, you know, of course, a lot of people, you know, a lot of rappers, we don't get open invitations everywhere.  So we have to fight for, you know, trying to break that whole stereotype sometimes. 
[01:56:30]  And that's what everybody has to do.  We all have kind of a stereotype.  That's even what Crash was all about, trying to not be so quick to judge certain people.  And that's the whole situation, you know, with the Oprah situation.  And at the end of the day, like I said, I still have a lot of respect for her and a lot of love for her.  I mean, if you don't respect Oprah, you have to respect her just because of what she's accomplished in her life.  And I just feel like when it came to that, like, that crossroad, it was just something that we agreed to disagree on.  But wouldn't you like to be able to make all your money without dealing with white folks? 
[01:57:00]  I would.  God, I would like to get rid of my white agents.  I wish I could make zillions just with black folks.  I really do.  So I don't have to look at your stupid faces ever again.  That is interesting that you said that.  I really want to.  Good luck.  You end up like who?  Like a lot of boxers.  Wait, Don King made a lot of millions.  Yes.  Yes, he did off the backs of the guys that didn't want the white guy helping him out. 
[01:57:30]  So?  So.  That answer is so.  Tyson did give Rooney the boot.  Good.  That's what I'm saying, man.  Not a good move.  You can't just say so.  I just want to see.  So, so, so your pants.  I don't know.  Exactly.  Can I talk about Crash for a second?  Because it was.  It's a long time ago, though.  Yeah.  Crash was a long time ago.  I know.  I'm dumb in the past.  We better not.  But that was such a great movie.  It was like.  It ain't better than Max Payne, though.  I haven't seen Max Payne yet. 
[01:58:00]  And I'll be talking about Max Payne two years from now, but I haven't seen it.  So I'm not going to lie.  Crash.  We all loved Crash.  It was about, I mean, it was about like stereotypes and not judging people.  But it seemed like every character in that got redemption somehow, which was great.  Like they show like the ugly stereotypical side of every person.  And then they also show like every person kind of getting redemption.  It was just a great, great movie, man.  Thank you, man.  I greatly appreciate it.  Were you surprised at one of the best pictures?  You know what, man?  To be honest with you, it was up against some really good movies that year. 
[01:58:30]  And I knew we had a shot.  But, you know, we absolutely like the whole cast.  We were kind of wondering whether or not it was going to make it.  That's why we were so surprised when it did.  But I knew it had a shot.  And I knew it was a great movie.  And it was kind of one of those word of mouth type movies that just built up over a long period of time.  So I was real happy about that.  But, no, I didn't know right away that it was going to get the Oscar.  Did everybody get that money?  That situation worked itself up?  That situation is still going on.  People didn't get paid, right, from that movie, right?  Yeah, like back ends.  Oh, wow.  Oh, really?  Yeah, people stole some money from Crash. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, yeah.  You got robbed.  Probably a lot on DVD sales, too, because a lot of the DVD stuff, the actors are still having trouble getting all their money.  I'm talking about actors.  Like, I can do it.  It's amazing how pompous I am, because I'm surprised that you had to read.  Well, I've done some acting.  I don't like to be called in to read.  I'm like, they should just kind of offer me something.  And I can't even get into a Dane Cook movie.  So the fact that you're still reading kind of makes me feel better.  Like, well, if he has to read after, you know, some of the stuff he's done.  Makes you feel better?  Yeah, but he wouldn't do it.  I have to read.  He wouldn't have to read. 
[01:59:30]  Because you're going to be reading forever.  Yeah, he wouldn't have to read if, like, in terms of rap, hip-hop, royalty, if that had to do with Hollywood, he wouldn't have to read a thing.  But he's a rapper.  Hollywood's crazy.  They're not like, hey, little Chris, you're wonderful here.  He got to read.  You got to read up until, I bet you, every Negro got to read, probably except for Denzel.  Except they just fired Terrence Howard from Iron Man 2. 
[02:00:00]  Did they fire him or did he quit?  He fired.  How did he know he was fired?  Because he was black asking for whiteness.  Oh, Jesus.  They almost got rid of Favreau.  And find out what happened.  Favreau was going to go, well, I should get double.  Really?  Because Marvel's like, hey, look, Iron Man sells himself.  We can put, you know, somebody in a wheelchair to play Iron Man, Jack.  We don't need you.  So everybody in Iron Man that started standing up for that money got the boot, starting with Terrence Howard, which is, you know, that's how it starts. 
[02:00:30]  Replace Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle.  He's not even the same body type.  He's not war machine.  No, but to answer your question, man, like sometimes I do have to audition, other times I don't.  It's kind of like half and half right now.  But like he said, you know, I mean, I've been blessed to be in some good projects, but I still, you know, I consider myself fairly new.  And I'm definitely, you know, continuing to increase the body of work and just to pick diverse roles.  And sometimes, like I said, they want to see you up against the person so to make sure there's chemistry. 
[02:01:00]  So that's the reason that you would audition as opposed to them just giving you something all the time until you get to, say, a Denzel level.  Do you get any people that get, like, annoyed at you or a little like, oh, man, look at him now.  He's doing the acting thing.  Of course.  Like you lose some credibility with some people.  You know what they call it in the hood?  Some people.  Some people.  Just haters.  It's like when Metallica does a song that's not as thrash as it was on Ride the Lightning.  People, like, they're changing.  They're not the same band. 
[02:01:30]  And, I mean, the rappers get the same thing from people who are like, I don't want to hear you do hip-hop.  I don't want to see you acting.  I don't want to see you.  Yeah, they don't want to see him do anything.  They don't want to see him living.  Yeah.  They're called haters.  He can do anything.  He's dropping an album.  He's acting there.  He is haters.  Of course.  In this day and age, you know, you have a lot of entrepreneurs, or I call myself an entrepre-negro.  So, you know, there's a lot of different things we do besides just rap.  And I think that people have accepted that at this point because they look at us as businessmen.  So it would be good to expand, you know, certain things that you're doing. 
[02:02:00]  Instead of just doing one thing all the time.  I fell in love with Crash when you guys were walking with the pistols.  And you're like, we're dressed like UCLA students or whatever you said.  Right, right.  And then they pulled the guns out and robbed them and took the truck.  It was so great because Hollywood has gotten so bent on showing you every stereotype and then completely going the opposite way.  Like you're crazy to ever feel uncomfortable or you're crazy to ever be afraid of something.  And Crash just put it right in your face.  It was just, I can't stop talking about that movie.  It was brilliant.  Are you a good guy, bad guy, gangster? 
[02:02:30]  Max Payne?  Yeah, what are you doing?  Internal affairs agent.  So, you know, Max Payne is considered the anti-hero, I guess, or kind of the bad guy.  You're playing an internal affairs agent.  Yeah, man.  Just doing something different.  We are acting now, Luke.  Absolutely.  I signed on just to be able to point a gun at Mark Wahlberg and get away with it.  So that's really why I did it.  We got to get Chris out of here.  He's just greatly appreciated.  Got a lot going on.  Hopefully, Oprah and Bill O'Reilly will all go purchase the album.  You're right there.  They did help.  Aerosmith did the same thing. 
[02:03:00]  They thanked Tipper Gore when they won because her complaining about labeling and all that  stuff helped push them through and somewhere else.  He thanked O'Reilly when he won the Grammys.  Yeah, yeah.  And Oprah, for that matter.  Even though it did happen a long time ago.  But hey, it's all good.  We're here.  If you want to exchange numbers, when this stuff happens, we'll call you the next day.  Don't even worry about it, man.  We can get it right on the radio.  I'm also a good actor, too.  So if there happens to be...  You're acting right now.  I'm peeping you out.  It's pretty cool.  You're doing good.  I'm very good.  I'm putting my arms open.  I'm actually gesticulating. 
[02:03:30]  I'm actually very good.  Yeah.  I don't know what to do with your arms.  I just think...  You know what to do with your hands when you act?  I know we're trying to go to break.  But my problem when I act is my hands.  I never know what to do with my hands.  It depends on your character.  Like, are you playing Rain Man or are you playing a basketball?  I always try to audition like the guy is paralyzed below the neck.  I just kind of sit with my head.  Something you got to work on, man.  Just work on it.  You'll be good.  Ladies and gentlemen, Patrice O'Neal is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, what's up?  This is Patrice O'Neal.  And you are enjoying the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:04:00]  And you're also enjoying the rest of this ludicrous situation.  This was back in the day, man.  This was very interesting.  Hmm.  Sit back.  Light a pipe.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  AIDS ever.  He writes, well, that was uncomfortable.  Patrice checked out.  Checked out.  It's not a black thing.  Not at all.  Because Patrice kind of tried to do a black thing there.  Black, white.  We get a lot of celebrities that do exactly what ludicrous does. 
[02:04:30]  Keep it very safe.  What is it?  You just don't want to.  I don't know.  When you're, and this is, look, I've been guilty of it on a much lower level because I'm not that far.  Look, let me say this, man.  I'm not, no.  All I'm saying is this.  Look, I'm going to Rhode Island.  There'll be two black people there, maybe.  I'm not saying, I'm saying, look, it's very difficult to entertain and this and that and keep your head when everybody has to be entertained. 
[02:05:00]  But I'm saying, in terms of, not every answer needs to be political, all the, like, who is he hurting just answering something in a real, Oprah doesn't want to have anything to do with him.  It just.  On our level, it's like when certain comedy clubs don't pass you.  This is for us.  Whether it was Lucian who ran the comic strip for many years or whoever it is.  And then you finally get passed at the club.  And my anger towards Lucian, once I got, he was a guy, he's dead now, but he ran the comic strip for years.  I hated him. 
[02:05:30]  Hated him.  When I finally got passed at the strip.  Right.  I really kind of stopped bad-mouthing him.  Like, I was like, eh.  And this was not even in a public forum like this.  My anger towards Lucian wasn't as bad anymore because I finally passed.  Because good is good if it's good for me.  You were happy because it was you.  But it wasn't phony.  It was just, I wasn't as angry anymore.  Or, even though I would have been, like, a little more likely to bash him than he was Oprah.  But, again, it wasn't on that level and it wasn't public.  But let me ask you this.  Okay.  I just want to say the whole Oprah thing, you made a great point during the break. 
[02:06:00]  You said the reason he doesn't want to even talk about the Oprah thing because there's a possibility Oprah will have him on to promote Max Payne.  Like, the question I got for Patrice, how would you have liked that interview to go?  Just.  With just what we were trying to accomplish.  You know what it was?  Ready?  Yeah.  I just, it was not going to, here's what stopped me.  Like, here's what stopped me from being involved because, look, I'm on you guys' show and it's just not for me as a black dude to challenge Ludacris, man. 
[02:06:30]  I'm just not going to do it on your show.  It's up to you guys to challenge him.  But when he said, he segued into Max Payne, that's when I left.  In my head.  When it went there because that's what he's here to do and he has to go do it at this place and that's the job and everything.  But maybe I don't, and this is what I was saying off air.  And maybe I don't want what I have to do to get at that level. 
[02:07:00]  Maybe I can trick this business into giving me a couple of mil and then take it and hide it under my mattress and then go back.  Because I don't know how, what do I have to do?  Do I have to be that way?  I don't know, man.  But as an artist.  And that way is, it just wasn't, nothing significant was going to happen, you know?  But as a comic, you're always going to talk as a comedian.  You're always going to speak through your work.  I'm certainly always going to speak through my work.  As an artist, he did his attacks through his work. 
[02:07:30]  And I'm only playing devil's advocate because he did hit O'Reilly and he did address that stuff through the work.  And when you're out promoting a film, you're out promoting a film.  He addressed it, though.  We're going to get the Max Payne plugs in.  But the stuff that has happened to Ludacris, it hits close to home with us.  We want to know, hey, what do you think of this, really?  And what goes through your mind?  And blah, blah, blah.  How could Oprah not want a hip-hop artist on her show?  And she says she doesn't want to empower them. 
[02:08:00]  That's crazy.  What do you think?  He addressed Bill O'Reilly and he addressed, on the bio, he addressed Barack Obama.  He addressed Bill O'Reilly and he addressed Oprah in what?  In rap.  In his rap songs.  That was his, what the interview should have been.  Yeah.  He did it in a rap song.  Right.  So here, it was like, there's the rap part, which is the whole Chris Ludacris last name.  The thing is, I'm here as the actor Ludacris. 
[02:08:30]  And he said that Ludacris was a, is a, is a character.  Yes, yes.  And that he can, he can rap as that character.  This is how his character felt.  So he's now separating what his rap is saying to what he's going to be saying when he, it, it just.  When he's Chris Bridges, the actor.  Dude, it was.  You were really annoyed because you, you, you bailed.  Because I didn't want to.  Patrice put his head down and just, I like, I looked over at one point and I'm like, I'm like thinking, well, why is it Patrice asking any questions or talking? 
[02:09:00]  Because my, I'm the only, it's just.  The only honest mother ever in the room?  No, no, no, no.  You want to try to keep it real?  No.  Well, what's the deal?  When I talk, it ain't EF Hutton, man.  I'm just a, a, a, a maniac.  A loser, a maniac.  Nothing I say means nothing.  Did you not let him?  When I want, when I go on Fox and talk about Don Imus, I'm a fool. 
[02:09:30]  Like, no one cares.  But, these guys, man, Chris Rock, ludicrous, 50, these guys are powerful, man, and they can say something.  When I say it, I'm an idiot.  Nobody cares until somebody who's seen bigger in the business says something, man.  But once they reach that point, they stop saying that stuff.  And when they get to that point, it's like, I'm going to, man, it's just, man, who gives a, who gives a damn, Max Payne, who cares? 
[02:10:00]  Because Mark Wahlberg will be talking about that all day.  And if you ask Mark Wahlberg, I wanted to bring up the fact, you know, he plays a guy who gets to point a gun at Mark Wahlberg's face.  But it was a break.  I was going to say, why?  To shoot him for good vibrations when he, when he was a rapper?  Do you know what I'm saying?  But I'm not saying he ain't keeping it real.  I'm saying, he can, man, he can, he can mix something up, man.  And, I mean, is it because I got nothing that, maybe I'm talking because I don't know what's out there that's going to make me change. 
[02:10:30]  So I'm setting myself up to be a hypocrite right now because somebody go, Patrice, here's $100 million and I never want you to open your big black mouth again.  And I might go, oh.  Believe me, we're trying to pull our cash.  Yeah, no kidding.  Why did he get annoyed so fast at the Bill O'Reilly?  Talking about, like, the past.  You want to talk about Max Payne?  But that's not just the past.  Talk about that already.  I know.  No, I'm saying, like, you said it was the past and it was kind of like.  Yeah, but for us it's not.  We've never talked to you before and it's, you know, it's good stuff. 
[02:11:00]  Is it annoyed?  And another thing that.  We weren't doing it just.  I'm a fan.  I'm a fan of him.  Is it annoyed?  Or is it like when you walk into a radio show?  Because we do an up press on the road.  We know how some of the radio shows are cool.  Some are dicks.  Is it annoyed or is it defensive?  Like, you don't know what the show is trying to do when they go after something.  Or mention something.  We know what we're trying to do.  Which is just basically talk about something.  Which is what put them in the spotlight in our eyes.  What difference does it make? 
[02:11:30]  If you go on a show and they ask you anything.  What difference does it really make to you?  To me, no difference.  But we do.  This show gets sick of every time that somebody asks about Sex for Sam.  The response is, yeah, all right.  We've addressed that.  Like, and it does happen sometimes.  So that's one of the, like, where if people ask you about certain instances of the radio show, like, what about the voyeur bus?  Like, they'll ask me that in interviews.  But if they ask you about Sex for Sam, Norton, and you're tired of it, but there's context to everything. 
[02:12:00]  Right.  If they talk about Sex for Sam to make you look like you're an idiot and you were fired, it's a different context than they want to know about it.  Because they don't know about it, and you know the difference.  Yes.  Most times, I know, but either way, and I'll answer it, but when they ask for the reasons of just wanting to know about it, I don't get angry.  I don't get, like, but I'm like, ugh, with this, what are they, because it does happen.  Or every time it's brought up in the paper, it's just a reference point.  Right.  But even though you know it's just a reference point, again, it's still a little annoying. 
[02:12:30]  I'm not saying he shouldn't, I look, I'm a comic, I answer things differently.  Why I checked out of the thing, I'm going to just tell you why I checked out.  But I'm a fan.  That's why I checked out.  You're a fan of Ludicrous, Steve?  I'm a fan.  What do you guys say?  Just to confirm what Jimmy said, when he left, he was absolutely, it was absolutely confirming what you said.  He just did, he wasn't familiar with the show.  He wasn't angry, he wasn't defensive, he wasn't anything.  He just, it was his first time.  And he didn't really, no, he didn't really get the vibe.  But he wasn't angry and he wasn't upset. 
[02:13:00]  He, you know, he was just doing what he was supposed to do.  You walk into a room with a station that you don't listen to, and again, I've done it where you're just not exactly sure  where everybody is coming from.  You don't know exactly, all right, why are they raising this?  Like, what, we've been through this.  They're just trying to start some crap on my name.  I'm not saying that, I'm not, I'm only saying because I've been in those situations, you don't know exactly.  And I didn't take it like, oh, he's trying to mother eff us.  I didn't get that vibe.  I didn't either.  Yeah, we were.  It wasn't, it wasn't, that's not what I'm talking, I'm saying, dude, I had a million things I could ask. 
[02:13:30]  I wanted to ask him.  It's just, you know, he's royalty, really, in the hood.  I mean, he's royalty, he is.  So when he comes in here, for real, he's a big, big celebrity.  But not here.  If I wasn't here, he'd just be, oh, okay, what's up, man, I want to know some.  But I could have drove it, and I was trying to drive it into that place where it's like more and more stuff, but it was just, I'm here for Max Payne.  I'm not here to cause, but you're already, this is what I'm saying, you're already caused it. 
[02:14:00]  Like, we're not embraced by Hollywood.  It's just not going to happen.  Who's we're, though?  We?  Yeah.  Niggas!  I'm saying, you're looking, you're making it that, and I'm saying that every celebrity on that level that comes here has nothing to do with that.  And that's what I'm saying, every celebrity on that level who's not black, that's what they do. 
[02:14:30]  Let me tell you, man, Chris Rock, and this is the thing, we're in the same world, so I've got to be careful with that, but he found out that he wasn't one of them when he did the Oscars.  And he found out that he really wanted to be one of them, which is, I watch MTV, and he trashes, when you watch MTV Awards, he trashes rappers, and he got the funniest stuff you can think of, talking about all the rappers, because he felt like an outsider. 
[02:15:00]  He felt like, I'm a comic, and he's relentless, and he did the Oscars, and Sean Penn gets up and says what he says to Chris, and it flustered him, because he realized, oh, man, I'm not an outsider.  I'm trying to be an insider, and he lets Sean Penn hurt his feelings?  Sean Penn, if I'm at Chris's level, at that level, where am I going to go? 
[02:15:30]  Where can I go once I'm at his level if I say to you, if I say, Sean, shut up.  Go play your little retarded characters, and go stand, go ride your boat through Katrina, shut up.  You didn't think he was pretty brutal on some of those people?  But when, yes, he ruined their night, but what Patrice is saying, when Sean Penn stood up for a joke Chris Rock told about, we always forget his name.  I know, I know. 
[02:16:00]  What Patrice, I think, is saying, Chris should have got up there and hit him right back.  Trashed him.  Hit him right back.  Because he's an outsider to Hollywood.  Right.  Yep.  And we're outsiders.  But as a comic, and I'm not saying I would love to attack Sean Penn or see him do it.  But for whatever reason, he didn't.  Maybe it just took him off guard, and he didn't want to, you know.  For whatever reason, the one moment of him not attacking Sean Penn doesn't, it doesn't matter, because it's not like the rest of it was polite.  The rest of it was pretty brutal for an Oscars host. 
[02:16:30]  I mean, even me and Colin talked the next night.  He really was kind of crappy to a lot of them.  So it was almost like he came in as a comic, doing what a comic does, and it was only that one moment where he maybe not reacted to the media.  Because that was the one moment of confrontation that them said, you're not us.  Sean Penn, it was a them thing where he goes, his name is, what is that guy's name? 
[02:17:00]  Jude Law.  Jude Law.  I would have been like, both of you, shut up.  Neither one of you have anything to do with me.  Yeah, Jude Law is one of our finest actors.  Get out of here.  He sleeps with his nanny.  I'm kind of aware, Patrice, that deserved a beating, because that was so ridiculous.  But it was shocking, because he realized that, man.  Not taking away with the edgy stuff Chris Rock was doing during the Oscars, but you have Sean Penn saying something as ridiculous as that.  How do you, as a comic, not go for that?  Only because...  And punch back a little bit. 
[02:17:30]  I don't understand that the more black people do get into, I don't know, Hollywood, politics, things like that.  Golden handcuffs.  The more angry you get that they're doing this.  No.  You see it...  Wrong.  You see it as...  Would you rather see fire hoses and German shepherds again?  No, no, no, no.  I mean, or there's an acceptance with...  You twisted that up, Anthony.  You're twisting that into me being angry about... 
[02:18:00]  I love...  This is what's making me angry, because I love...  There is no black hierarchy of us.  There's a black hierarchy of me, and then we're in this.  But Oprah is her, and Ludacris is him, and 50 is him.  But I'm not saying that they...  I want everybody to have some money.  I'm saying, what is it?  And I said this earlier. 
[02:18:30]  What is it about that level that makes you not say anything?  Fear of losing that level.  Yeah.  And it's all celebrities on that level.  You're looking at him the way a lot of guys would look at you.  Even though it's a total...  You're not the typical case point, because you're Patrice.  But say most comics that are on your level, who are still brutal, but guys like us don't...  We're not stupid brutal.  We know... 
[02:19:00]  We'll tease people in this...  And there's people who might have known years ago, why is he doing this?  Why is he not coming that hard?  And that, in a way, he's on that level higher than us.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  It's leveling up.  Yeah.  And a lot of celebrities do it.  Like, when they...  I'm not saying he's supposed to be a maniac, Norton.  No, I don't know.  I mean, look.  I mean, we're talking about it, but it's like, you know, I'm going to say the wrong thing  until I say the right thing.  I'm not saying that he's supposed to come on here and go, F Bill O'Reilly.  I'm just saying...  We just wanted to get his point of view on the whole thing.  Yeah.  That's all. 
[02:19:30]  We weren't about...  It would be fun if he did, because we hate the guy, but, yeah.  Just not...  We just wanted his thoughts on it.  Just not...  Just not, like, the carefulness...  I'm not saying...  Come on.  All right.  I'm not saying a maniac.  I'm saying the...  Just carefulness of just...  I'm...  Hey, I'm here for Max.  But, like, just the careful...  Just...  What?  But, you know, it's just being very safe.  Yeah.  And it's not a black thing.  We've seen it with...  Absolutely.  Big, uh...  Big white, uh... 
[02:20:00]  White, uh...  Stars as well.  Dude, you got a studio sending you out, like, and they're saying promote this, and you make  an X amount of million for a movie.  It's almost like, why go through the hassle?  And we weren't saying attack, Oprah.  We weren't saying attack, all right.  We were really just asking about it.  But if you walk into a situation where you don't know the players, it's not like we're  a station the guy's been on, like Kevin Smith comes in, and he'll talk about anything.  Because he knows us, he's comfortable, and he's...  When you're in a situation where you're promoting this major film, and, you know, in the last couple  of years, it's not like he's been doing major films for ten years. 
[02:20:30]  Where do you go with that?  Like, do you attack these icons now that the storm has settled?  Let me ask you this.  I just, I just, I think he should have, because all we were asking was, how do you feel at  the time?  Yeah.  You could be honest and say, well, you, you know, you probably wanted to go down there  and twist Bill O'Reilly's head off at the time.  He cost you so much money.  And that's why I said, and I said to him, I went, at that time when it happened, like,  like, that's when you can say, yeah, this is what I wanted to do.  You know, in hindsight now, it wasn't that big a thing. 
[02:21:00]  At the time, that was my livelihood this son of a bitch was taking away.  That's, you know, that's, that's honestly, we could, we talk about Bill Donahue.  It's the same situation.  At the time, I wanted to take his gray head and smash it on a curb.  And now he's been on the show and I'm like, you know, all right, he's just doing what  he does.  I'm not kissing his ass to get advancement anywhere, but time, water under the bridge,  whatever you want to call it.  But at the time, and I could be honest, still, I could sit here and go, yes, at the time 
[02:21:30]  I wanted to smash him.  Okay.  So you're right.  At the time, I would like to have heard a little bit more about that.  Yeah.  But be a little honest.  Once you get to a certain point in your career and you see how fast it can be taken away  or like he happened to rebound and do really well.  But when you see how quickly one of these guys, one of these massive people, like when  you see how the machine works and how it can just chop you off, like for you to lose a  major endorsement just because stupid, all right, it's, you're probably hesitant for 
[02:22:00]  no reason at all.  So that's considered a sellout.  No, it's not, not at all.  Technically, I mean, I wouldn't, I wouldn't disagree or not do it.  I would do it too.  Can I ask you thoughts of what you said?  I think a sellout would be if O'Reilly attacked him again and he was like, aha, well, you  know, that's just, you know, you said a thing like if, if he knew the show, you said Kevin  Smith knows the show.  Let's say this.  If he knew the show and then you asked him those questions, if he knew you, he knew what 
[02:22:30]  you were about, he, his friends, say, say his radio show friends asked him those questions,  then what would, would, maybe you're just more comfortable to go back there and know  that if you say, man, I was really aggravated.  I hated the guy.  You kind of know that when you answer certain questions, you might not know where this show  is going to take it or what we're going to.  I don't know.  I'm not, I'm only speculating.  I've been on different radio shows before.  Right.  And I know, you know how it is.  Sometimes you walk in and there's a weird vibe.  Sometimes it's a great vibe, but once you're on more than once or twice or three times, 
[02:23:00]  then you're more comfortable.  I can't wait to get back to that show.  They took care of me.  They treated me right.  Um, you know, I, I felt comfortable there first time in any show, especially look, the  reputation for the show is very aggressive.  I mean, I, I'm amazed at how aggressive this show is when I do other shows like Jesus,  we really do say some harsh things, even on terrestrial radio where we, I mean, we really  do address things with brutality.  So a lot of times you're going on a show that look, people are aware. 
[02:23:30]  This is what they know about open Anthony.  Oh, those are the guys sex for Sam sex in the church.  They know the crazy outrageous stuff about us that he probably thinks we know about him.  So I'm only saying, look, I would love to have had answers, but that's why I'm not mad  about it.  That's why I'm not, because I didn't feel like it was being, he was trying to be a  dick to us.  I think that a lot of times he just, you're not a hundred percent sure where someone's going  I don't, I don't think he was.  That was my take.  I don't think he was.  I just, I just, it's that.  I'm just, it was just the, let me get to, it just, it wasn't, forget all that is snowing 
[02:24:00]  and it's just, so what did you feel about what happened in your life?  And then it just answered as opposed to I'm not, what is, he doesn't really insight on  your personality, who you are before we get to the plug.  Yeah, that might've been, and that's way more interesting to us than, you know, talking  about Max Payne for 20 minutes.  Sure, because people don't know it. 
[02:24:30]  There's a problem.  We need to, you know, get our listeners and, you know, into what we're doing.  And, and we know that talking about Max Payne for 20 minutes is not going to get the job  done.  I'm sorry.  It's just not.  Don't forget.  And that's why you look at these bios and go, wow, that's something that's worth talking  about.  He's got some interesting stuff happen in his career.  And he might give us another, he might give us another angle.  These guys don't understand our side of this.  They, they want to come in here and just give us like very, very boring Max Payne plug type  radio.  And that's, that's not going to do him any good or us any good in the end. 
[02:25:00]  See, I know that as a comic and stuff, and I'm sure he's done a lot of radio stations,  but a lot of the guys, a lot of celebrities do TV.  And when you're doing TV, it's a very set way of doing it where you're on for six minutes  or seven minutes.  You get a little clip of the thing shown, they talk about the movie a lot.  It's very, you know what I'm saying?  It's like, you know exactly what the drill is.  You know exactly what the routine is.  When you walk into a radio show, we get 15 minutes and all of a sudden there's five guys  and they start bringing up stuff from the past and the studios, you just don't know exactly 
[02:25:30]  where it's going to go.  I know why we do it.  Yeah, we get to go long form, you know?  I call that what you just described.  Who gives a crap TV?  It happens all the time.  And that's why I don't watch any of that stuff.  Because I know nothing is going to happen.  I agree.  No, I know.  I'm with you.  I'm just reiterating.  Look, if I ever got to the level of respect and money and glory, I would love to just  let every other black person who knows what happens on that way, what you got to do and 
[02:26:00]  got to deal with and explain even the fact that he had to do Max Payne, explain that.  Just tell me what it's like to be at your level and be black.  Let me know.  Yeah, he didn't seem to want to be black at that moment.  Are you voting for Obama?  He just wanted to be the guy.  Yeah, I know.  You're voting for Obama?  Well, I just got to tell you, it's just important to get out there and vote. 
[02:26:30]  But most celebrities on that level would say that.  Most celebrities, it's not a black-white thing.  And most celebrities on that level promoting for a major movie with Mark Wahlberg or any  We're not talking about phony white people.  That was a little odd.  That's what white people do.  That was a little odd.  It's a celebrity thing.  It's not a white-black thing.  It's a celebrity thing.  But I didn't even catch that because, you know, if he says, I'm voting for Obama, then  everyone voting for McCain might not.  Some of these people aren't going to go see Max Payne now. 
[02:27:00]  Or it might just open a political argument.  I'm not saying that.  It might open a political argument that you don't want to get into when you're promoting a film.  Well, you know something?  You're promoting a film.  You want people to kind of like you, know you a little bit.  I think it would have been good.  It would have been compelling radio to hear his point on, you know, a guy that is successful,  making a lot of money.  Why are you voting for Obama knowing that more of your money is going to be taken away?  Just things like that.  And then you get that answer.  Well, the important thing is just get out there and vote.  I agree.  That was kind of an ugh answer.  It's obvious he's voting for Obama. 
[02:27:30]  He has a rap song about it.  Yeah.  He loves the Obama.  Yes.  But it's about, you know, people that might be buying movie tickets that are voting for McCain  and next thing you know, they're going to go see some other movie.  I'm with Patrice on this one.  Definitely.  I'm not even against Patrice.  I'm not against Patrice.  Yes, you are.  I'm really not.  You're racist.  I'm only listening to his argument.  You can kiss our black asses.  I'm only listening to his argument and it's almost like we've seen enough guys who don't  want to go into certain areas and they're doing promo or whatever for it to not be as much  of a black and white thing. 
[02:28:00]  It's just a celebrity on a certain level thing.  You get to a certain level of celebrity and you get exactly what happened today.  Ladies and gentlemen, Patrice O'Neal is hosting the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal and you are listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  And I don't know why they call it the worst, man.  They should call it the best because these guys, they're great.  They're good people.  They don't want nobody to know it, but they're good guys.  So this worst of, you see what they're doing?  It's the worst of, but it's really the best.  You see what I'm saying?  How they do it? 
[02:28:30]  You see, you see, you don't get it?  Okay.  The worst of Opie and Anthony brought to you by Halloween 2, a Rob Zombie film in theaters  August 28th.  Now listen.  Your attention, please.  Station of the virus.  Sirius 197.  XM 202.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony hosted by Patrice O'Neal.  Let's begin now.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal, and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony hosted by me. 
[02:29:00]  Oh, shit.  This bit is hilarious, I think.  I think it got me my reputation on the show for hating women, but I hated them long before  this shit.  But this one was that girl.  I don't know if you remember this girl that came in and it was a bunch of, you know, some  more bitches that take their clothes off or show you half their titty or whatever.  And one of them had a coat, and the rest came in with good attitudes, and I think she ran  out crying.  I don't know.  I'm not here to make bitches cry, even though it still feels good, and I'm 40. 
[02:29:30]  I'm a childish motherfucker.  All right.  Listen to this shit.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  Hey, girls.  Hello.  Hi.  Wow-wee.  Hi, ladies.  Oh, well.  We got girls.  Girls in the studio.  Girls in the studio.  Woo.  Were you enjoying the radio?  We didn't mean to make you wait that long, but we were on a roll there with the country  music and stuff.  Sounded funny.  It sounded funny?  You guys were entertaining, I'll say. 
[02:30:00]  Thank you very much.  Definitely.  Look at that.  We're entertaining.  You guys are on the webcam.  Why the two black girls outside, like fucking niggas?  Yeah, what's up with the black girls?  They weren't hot enough?  No.  One's our tour manager.  Bring these bitches in here so I can have some fucking fun.  They don't want to be in here.  Yeah, bring her in.  Benita.  I'm like five light bulbs.  My eyes are on for my cornea burning.  Bring something to fucking lower the fucking...  You don't know what a tungsten down in this motherfucker.  Jesus.  You know how pathetic we are, man? 
[02:30:30]  We got girls from the lingerie bowling studio, and one of them's wearing a winter coat over  her lingerie.  Yeah.  That's how scared they are of us.  We're the worst.  No.  I'm not a cheerleader.  I'm a tour manager.  Oh, we thought you were...  No.  Oh, wow.  But she could be.  Fit in very nicely.  Do I go back?  No.  I want to look at you.  No, maybe you can help us...  Oh, hi.  Maybe you can help...  The one in the coat is the fucking cunt.  Like, she's the asshole.  She's not controlled.  She's out of control.  She's the only one without a phony fucking smile plastered on her face. 
[02:31:00]  She hates this shit.  For dreams.  You got dreams and aspirations, don't you, dear Puddin' Pops, huh?  Well, give them up and go down the road of hell like the rest of these fucking girls  here.  Stop trying to have dignity.  I'm going to wear a coat.  I'm not just about tits and smiling, you motherfuckers.  And you know why it's true?  Her friends are laughing at her.  Get rid of her.  She's bringing your whole porno room down.  Jesus Christ.  Christ, I can fucking sniff it.  Look at her.  She's just like... 
[02:31:30]  Patrice, excuse me, allow me to retort.  Well, let the girl in the winter.  Perhaps the air conditioning is so fucked up in this place all the time that it's chilly.  It's not affecting Blondie.  Thank you.  Everybody has different temperatures.  The girl is beautiful.  We have been outside in the crazy cold weather in New York.  We're from California.  We're not used to that.  Yeah.  We're not used to that.  Oh, boy.  And what she's doing now?  Patrice.  She does that every time you come out. 
[02:32:00]  Get rid of her.  But she...  She does that every time.  She brings it down.  No, you do that every time.  What?  I'm just saying.  Now they're going to act like they heard about it.  That girl is fine.  I would love...  What was her name?  Danielle.  Danielle.  She's a beautiful, fine girl.  I won't say anything else.  Beautiful.  She's a classy, very nice girl.  Of course.  Did you hear...  What's your name again, pumpkin?  Benita.  Did you hear Benita has...  She has a script in her head that she says all the time when she has to cover up for Miss 
[02:32:30]  Jacket.  No, I don't.  Well, we were disappointed that she came in with a winter coat over her lingerie.  Well, she's cold.  She's...  But you're not cold.  I'm from Michigan originally.  She's from Michigan.  I can take it.  It depends where you were born, I guess.  You're naked.  I am partly naked.  Yeah, they got their tops on and their tight jeans.  You got me disappointed about the coat.  And you're black and you know how we don't like the fucking cold.  I don't like the cold.  Now, this lovely young lady here is wearing some type of outerwear, but at least it's 
[02:33:00]  a sexy coat.  Yes.  It's an inviting, I am chilly, but I'm still in the fucking character coat.  Yes.  Exactly.  She put on fucking Spanky from the fucking Our Gang coat, came in here with this...  Everybody here, look at this girl.  She can't stop smiling.  She's a trooper.  Put a surgery smile on.  She's a sexy bitch.  And we call her a good...  She is...  But the one in the back...  She's playing the role.  She stood in the back...  You are one of the most misogynistic, women-hating, sons of bitches... 
[02:33:30]  Let's talk about why you hate women.  Wait, Patrice...  I'll tell you shit.  You hate women.  We know.  I'm with Patrice, though.  No.  We called her out on it.  And that's why she left.  Because people...  Because if she was being righteous, she wouldn't have left.  She'd be like, oh, no, she wouldn't have left.  Erick, go talk to the girl.  You said the C word, and that's bad.  Hold on.  You jumped to conclusions.  All right.  I forgot.  Let me explain something to her.  Wait.  We're going to talk to her.  Let me explain something to her life real quick that people don't know.  Huh?  Cunt is the bitch for black girls.  You call a black girl a bitch, it gets the same reaction if you call a white girl a cunt. 
[02:34:00]  Now, cunt to a black girl is not that offensive, but cunt to a white girl.  All right.  That's the biggest word.  That's the A-bomb.  I was saying it, because I call my girl a cunt sometimes, but she's black, so it doesn't  fuck with her like that.  So I didn't mean to make her go, because you call me a cunt, but I wanted to let her know  that I can smell her vibe, and that you came in and you're always playing good cop for her  horse shit.  No.  You're absolutely positively wrong.  I don't see that at all.  E-Rock.  Wait, what happened?  I see you as a woman-hating man who had a pick on one of these beautiful girls. 
[02:34:30]  I like that.  Yeah.  I see that, too.  Hold on.  We got E-Rock back in the studio.  You might be right.  You might be right.  We were trying to get her word on this whole thing, because you chased her out of the studio.  Yeah.  E-Rock went outside the studio, and what happened?  She's going to come back, and you're going to make it up to her.  I'm not going to.  No, she left.  I'm going to feel it.  I feel her.  She left.  She walked out.  She wanted nothing to do with this, and walked out.  And she wanted nothing to do with it in the fucking first place.  Nigga.  I don't tell her.  I know shit like that.  She didn't want to come in here.  Tell the truth, Benita.  Tell the motherfucking truth.  Oh, man. 
[02:35:00]  I gave her an excuse to fucking leave.  Benita's like, damn, now I've got to replace a girl.  How am I going to find a hot girl in two weeks?  Oh, my God.  Thank you.  No, I'm just joking.  Just don't make me look like a complete dick.  No.  Someone get a phone, and let's talk to this girl.  She's running out of the studio now.  I'm not going to talk.  No.  No.  I don't think you're getting a comment.  I will say nothing else.  I'll sit there and shut my face.  Oh, great.  Let us pick up the pieces?  I'm saying, I'll defend myself, but I didn't want her to run out.  But I'm saying that she, before she came in here, she didn't. 
[02:35:30]  And I can tell, you can't see, isn't it?  Oh, really?  Criswell?  The great Kreskin?  He's like tailgating.  You went with a Criswell when she woke up.  No.  No.  The one with the sexy winter coat on, she keeps looking around with like, oops.  He caught her on her face.  No.  Because she knows.  These girls, you know, regardless.  Wait, that one's laughing.  You got her.  She's on your side.  The one in the tiny blue top's on your side, Patrice. 
[02:36:00]  Um, no.  The only.  I don't know.  I'm sorry.  Listen, tell us that I'm sorry.  You chased her out.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry for.  Tell us come on out on the air.  I'm sorry for saying cunt to her.  I really am.  And you're also sorry for.  No, he sees himself as completely right.  I want to apologize for that.  Okay, look.  I didn't want her to run out.  I, you know, I could be abrasive.  Tell her I'm sorry.  Tell her I'm sorry.  I am sorry.  It's a bit much.  What do I need to do?  What do I need to do for her?  Hold on, Patrice.  Okay.  But she didn't really want to be here, right? 
[02:36:30]  No, of course.  We're excited.  Of course she does.  I want to be here.  13th City Tour.  We're having a ball.  13th City Tour.  And this is the one place she doesn't want to be, Patrice?  Come on.  We totally, we were totally excited about being here.  You love me, yes.  She's just a nice person that kind of gives to herself and she doesn't run her mouth randomly.  This is what.  You're obsessed, Patrice.  These girls.  It just sounded like a Dodge trying to start.  I just don't want to be like, because it was unfounded.  Are you going to admit that she's beautiful?  She was fucking sexy. 
[02:37:00]  What do you want?  I mean, that's not, that wasn't the point.  It was attitude.  It was one of these things.  It's not like the other.  You are a big bully.  No, you don't want.  I applaud.  I just came off like a big bully guy.  I applaud Patrice, though.  People need to come in here and want to have fun.  She wasn't in here long enough to even see.  She said not one word.  Not a word.  Right.  And this is you.  On her back.  Right.  And another thing, though, for real, really.  Yeah.  On her back.  Body language.  I just, people. 
[02:37:30]  Yeah, you were feeling it.  Usually, I'm a professional at walking people out of comedy shows.  And usually, if the person that's being walked, if their friends don't walk with them, there's a slight bit of truth to that.  Have you ever seen from Dusk Till Dawn?  Have you ever seen Quentin Tarantino's character?  Yeah, yeah.  And, like, when a woman was around him, how he fantasized and, like, thought he heard her say things and meant things.  That's you.  No.  You were two seconds away from the guy leaving the room.  One guy, and you hacking her up into pieces on the bed.  No, man.  You are a psychopath. 
[02:38:00]  No.  It's like, she was lovely.  All right.  Well, we lost her.  We got three lovely blondes still in the studio.  They're all beautiful.  Well, hopefully, we'll have three by the time this ends.  And the girl outside.  Let's Patrice once insult somebody else.  I don't want to.  The girl outside?  You mean the girl that's out in the street?  No, not that bitch.  The, uh, the, your sister.  The sister.  That's your sister?  No.  I said the sister.  The sister?  What does she do?  Sister and sister.  She's a part of our PR firm.  Oh, I love them.  I love all of them.  She was gorgeous.  She'll be the one that gives a full report back to, you know, their people. 
[02:38:30]  And tell them all about you.  Yeah.  So you girls are cheerleaders.  You guys rock.  Do you play?  Secret weapons, yeah.  Do you get out there and knock it around a little bit?  Mm-hmm.  What do you play in?  Do you play in the same, like, cheerleader uniform?  No.  No?  If we were brought out on the field, we're going to play in this and then the little shorts.  In that?  I see, because you got numbers on your, uh, little, hot little tops.  And I'm wearing the cheerleader outfit.  And you got the cheerleader outfit on.  We're representing both sides.  Yes, you are.  Very good.  See?  I found nothing wrong with the other girl, with these girls. 
[02:39:00]  Yeah, I thought we could loosen her up a little bit.  Would have been nice, like, you know, uh, I like brunettes.  It would have been nice to have a brunette in here.  Not that, you know, the blondes aren't beautiful, but he chased the only brunette out of the  whole goddamn building.  I know.  Chased her out of Manhattan.  Manhattan, you big, you King Kong motherfucker.  No, you're terrorizing Manhattan, huh?  Call me a big black, uh, call me anything you want.  Go ahead.  You can, go ahead.  Go ahead, ladies.  Get it out.  You King Kong motherfucker.  Wait, I still don't know what this lingerie bowl's about. 
[02:39:30]  Obviously, there's the hotness factor, but then what?  Yeah.  It's girls playing football.  There's hot women playing football.  And lingerie.  Most importantly, there's cheerleaders.  Lingerie.  Oh, Jenny McCarthy's hosting.  Dennis Rodman is the commissioner.  The commissioner.  There's a lot of celebrities involved.  You ever see, it's great, the snap, when they hike the ball.  Yeah.  The girl bends over.  That's very nice.  And the girl between her legs like that.  Very sexual.  Are there going to be any oopsies?  Pretty much.  Will there be any? 
[02:40:00]  There are oopsies, yes.  There are oopsies?  Yeah, some hair might be cold.  See, that's, any record setting for rushing or passing yardage or field goal length, nothing  like that going to be.  I doubt we'll see any records broken like that, no?  Who's the lady in charge?  What's your name?  Benita.  You need to sell this better.  The guys out there need to know that there's going to be oopsies.  There are oopsies.  There's a possibility.  Oopsies about the football, but all of a sudden, there's always a possibility of oopsies.  You ever see in pro football where a guy, maybe the shirt gets pulled and the shoulder 
[02:40:30]  pad pops out?  Yeah.  Think that.  Think that?  Will that happen?  It can happen.  Anything can happen.  Anything can happen.  Waldrope.  Oh, Waldrope.  Anything can happen.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  All right.  Write a letter right now.  Are you penning a little note?  Dear.  He's got a good heart.  Wait, you're making him apologize?  Dear Dan.  Big teddy bear with a good heart.  Dear, what's her name?  He can admit when he has made a mistake and that's what he's currently doing.  And I'm so, I'm standing next to him and I'm feeling a great deal of pride. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah.  So sorry.  Where did you get that picture of me?  I've seen him be such a big teddy bear sweetheart and I've seen him just be a despicable human  being.  Some people have those extremes.  Yes.  And we've seen one extreme and now we're seeing another.  I'm impressed right now.  And, uh, the C word and pre-judging you.  Boy.  You pre-judged her.  I was wrong. 
[02:41:30]  He's writing a book.  Okay, it's okay.  Oh my God.  You know what?  Patrice O'Neal.  I like that picture.  There you go.  There you go.  All right.  I don't even know what to say other than wow.  There you go.  I'm wowed by you right now.  Wow.  I just wrote, I just wrote Danielle.  Dear Danielle, I am sorry.  So sorry for calling you the C word.  And boy, I was wrong.  And then Danielle, she let herself go.  She let herself go.  There you go. 
[02:42:00]  That's all you can do is try to make your wrongs.  I'm sorry.  Okay.  Well, Patrice called her the C word.  You guys, thank you so much for having us on your show.  You guys, any more questions?  How many hotties?  On either side.  Standard football rules?  Yes, sir.  All right.  It's seven on seven.  Seven on seven.  Seven on seven.  What about the nails?  The girl's going to break the nails?  How are they going to protect their fine nails?  I'm looking.  You can't go by me.  I'm a cheerleader.  I'm not playing well. 
[02:42:30]  I have the real things.  When you're playing contact football, it's not about the nails.  You're out there.  It's about the sport.  No, it's about the oopsies.  And this is going to be tackling.  Tackling.  Full on contact.  What do you wear on your legs?  Is it going to be...  They have knee pads.  Like, what do you got on under there?  I see matching some...  Jesus Christ.  These are like little boy shorts.  They are little boy shorts, indeed.  Uh-huh.  Indeed they are.  Can we see an oopsie?  That's wonderful.  Knee pads. 
[02:43:00]  Very sexy.  They're like little.  All right.  All right, girls.  That's wonderful.  They got to go?  All right.  All right, ladies.  I'm sorry.  Thank you so much.  Thank you for coming in.  You should be in this, by the way.  We appreciate having you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye, guys.  Sorry we got off on the wrong foot there.  Yeah, the wrong foot.  The wrong foot.  But the foot was in balance, so...  Give him a tongue lashing.  Give him a tongue lashing.  You a tongue lashing.  Thank you, ladies.  And there they go.  The girls in the lingerie mall.  I want to get this out of the way right now. 
[02:43:30]  Holy...  I bow to Patrice today.  Are you doing the...  I absolutely bow to you, my friend.  You're doing the slow clap.  I bow to you.  You saw something, and you went for it.  I haven't seen that vicious an attack that quickly.  He was like...  You ever hear about the attacks where someone's standing there, and a pit bull...  Who's all happy and wagging its tail, just lunges at someone's throat that's in the room? 
[02:44:00]  That's what that reminded me of.  You can't see it, dude.  It's like...  I'm not...  Like, you can go to Kreskin, but it's like...  I just...  It's just...  You can feel that run through.  Yeah.  And it's just like...  You can't feel that comfortable being that just...  Because she did look good, but you can't feel comfortable coming here, changing the mood.  Because you know what?  Wow.  She was listening to us for an hour, being completely juvenile.  And she just could... 
[02:44:30]  She just was like...  So you're seeing...  Yucky.  You are either the nastiest, or the most insightful person I've ever seen.  I just...  No.  You didn't see that?  I am so with Patrice on this.  I didn't even see it.  Soon as she walked in with a winter coat, that was such a sign it wasn't even funny.  Like Patrice said, the other girl had kind of a coat on, but it was still sexy and had something to do with the lingerie action.  I didn't notice.  The other girl had a winter coat, like she was ready to go down the slope.  You know, you could be right, but I didn't even notice it. 
[02:45:00]  And she pretty much had her arms folded.  She did not want to be in that situation.  And the reason why we don't have a lot of women on the show lately is because of women just like her.  Where they're like, ugh.  They just want to go through the motions.  Absolutely.  Wow.  The rest of the girls were lovely.  I liked them.  They played the role.  They were having fun.  Bye.  I didn't say anything to...  It's like, you can feel it.  You're just surprised, Anthony, because he jumped on her so quickly.  No, because I didn't notice. 
[02:45:30]  Usually we will like, kind of like, you know...  We would have had to have talked to her a little bit, and then we would have been...  Dude.  We've been in that situation, and you talk to him a little while, and then you go, all right, this chick just ain't into it.  But you were like...  No, no.  I saw some friggin' brainwaves.  No, I saw it, too.  I saw it, too.  And when I was thinking to myself, like, here we go again, and I'm going to have to do a little Evil Opie.  I swear to God.  But I thought it was going to be 10 or 15 minutes in where I finally would call her out or something.  Evil Opie is Jesus compared to the monster we saw. 
[02:46:00]  I understand.  That's what made it great.  And look at me, man.  I swear to you.  It's just...  It's like the comfort zone to bring it down.  It's just...  You know, she needed that.  It was a little medicine.  It didn't taste right.  No.  You know, she'll feel better later, because she won't do that again.  Are they gone?  Sort of.  Are they out of earshot?  Sort of.  I think Patrice needs to run out there and give the one girl a little commo.  Commo.  I'm getting all thumbs up. 
[02:46:30]  Commo.  I tell her.  I tell her.  I tell her.  Oh, okay.  The audio's off.  Look, let me say this then.  Patrice, that was fan-fucking-tastic.  Look, someone has to play good cop in order to keep anyone in the room.  But, oh my God, when you unloaded on her, I was laughing my ass off inside.  God bless you, Patrice O'Neal.  Oh my God.  She was an 11, by the way.  It's like you come here, and you're just free. 
[02:47:00]  Your mouth is free.  Well, that's good.  When you go on the regular radio, you just go, oh, shit, how do I do this again?  Patrice, don't ever lose that.  I'll kill you.  Patrice, do you realize this also?  Do you realize probably when you first came on this very show, and I'm not talking about  any W, I'm talking about our XM show, that she was probably in high school.  Like, that was a baby girl.  It's just-  That was a little baby girl.  I don't hate-  It's like, I hate the entitlement that she felt to be how she was. 
[02:47:30]  She can't even go across the street and get a drink to feel better.  She's not old enough.  But she thinks that that makes her somebody because-  But you know what?  Bravo.  I say the same thing that every guy says to her in the street.  They say to 40 other women in the next block, and she has to learn how to be a little bit  bigger than how cute she is.  A little thicker skinned. 
[02:48:00]  Do you understand?  Just better.  You know what you did?  She left because she felt entitled.  She didn't want to be here.  You felt it.  You put the first wrinkle on her face.  She's been a kid, loved, like just looked at and appreciated, never had a bad thing said.  She like scowled, and you put that first wrinkle in her face.  The first wrinkle!  On that 20-year-old face.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  You don't apologize.  It just was, I don't know.  That was fine.  She's starting to realize that her hotness isn't going to get her through life. 
[02:48:30]  It's life.  It's life.  You gave her a life lesson.  That's right.  There you go.  Thank you.  You're an asshole.  I know.  Ladies and gentlemen.  Patrice O'Neal is hosting The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal.  You can find me on myspace.com slash Patrice O'Neal or patriceoneal.com because hopefully  that should be up by the time you hear this.  Or twitter.com at Big Mama Productions.  Actually, it's Big Mama Prods, which is short for Big Mama Productions. 
[02:49:00]  B-I-G-M-O-M-M-A Prods.  Hey, what's up?  This is Patrice O'Neal, and you're listening to the best.  I say the best, but they promote it as the worst of Opie and Anthony, but I say the best  Opie and Anthony.  And here's a little something.  It's amazing.  This story, amazingly, is what ended me and Danny's friendship.  We used to be fucking real tight.  Now we kind of have this quiet, grunting to each other, little bitch-ass motherfucker.  Get over shit, man.  I still love you to dry hair, but now you're fucking anti-Patrice, you little bitch. 
[02:49:30]  I asked you for a couple of fucking, hey, can you burn me a CD, Danny?  Now you can't get a hold of the tapes.  You know what I'm saying?  Ain't that a bitch?  But I love you.  We lost our friendship over a virus that may have been downloaded on a computer.  Well, why don't this company get Apple, nigga, so you don't have to worry about viruses,  cheap motherfuckers.  Hey, have all the comics come in and read for free.  Sure, master.  I'll do it now. 
[02:50:00]  Mr. Sears, sir.  Mr. Sears, XM, sir.  Motherfuckers.  God damn, I ain't got...  Ain't that a bitch?  I got a job, but not getting paid for it.  This is volunteer work.  I'm volunteering for Sears like I'm an intern.  Motherfucker.  Broadcasting the worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  I want to have four or five or six White Castle burgers.  I've been really jonesing for some White Castle.  Never really liked those.  White Castle almost made me...  I got violently ill once with White Castle and I never had it again.  Did you ever get the chicken sandwiches from White Castle? 
[02:50:30]  I don't like the burgers.  I can only imagine what the fuck that is.  You get them with cheese and some mayonnaise and pickles on them.  Oh my God, dude.  Since 1992 when I came to New York for the first time...  91.  I traveled to New York with my friends from college.  Yeah.  Ate White Castle.  And that was the first time, by the way.  I never forgot.  It was the first time I ever jerked off in a...  At a White Castle.  No, in a...  First time I ever applied for a job.  In a booth.  In a New York...  Oh, in one of those New York...  In a peep booth, yeah.  Was it your first time in New York, too?  Yeah.  Well, you couldn't wait, could you? 
[02:51:00]  In a peep booth.  And I felt...  Ah, New York.  I felt like such a creep.  Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building.  Where are we going?  Oh, I'm going to go jerk off in a booth.  Because that's when I had the girls behind the window.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I ate a girl's ass behind one of those.  You heard about that.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I used to like...  Are you serious?  Oh, please.  Yeah.  God.  Yeah.  How?  You like the...  I'm not even...  I was just going to ask, how would you do that?  But it's Jimmy.  Don't you know, like, guys are all over that shit?  What was that?  What did I know? 
[02:51:30]  She's filthy.  Well, that was a good boy.  Oh, Jimmy.  And you just eat...  What did it taste like?  You were talking to those awful phones.  I don't remember, actually.  I just remember doing it.  Oh, the phone itself just must have been covered.  Yeah.  Covered with just jizz and bacteria.  That would probably smell like...  I did a phone one in Atlantic City, and it was the saddest fucking thing.  You know when you go to the zoo and you see the sick animals?  That's what it was like.  Just this stripper sitting behind the glass.  I mean, just putting no energy into masturbating.  Yeah.  And I go, are you going to do a little show?  And she goes, literally, like this. 
[02:52:00]  And she goes, this is what it is, honey.  And like, dude...  Just spreads her legs and lays back and does nothing.  Yeah.  I still whacked one out, but I mean, it was so fucking sad, dude.  You know, there were days before VCRs and stuff, too, where that was the only place to  get, like, real motion picture porno, unless you went to a porn theater.  There used to be one in Bayshore, I guess, out on Long Island.  It was the only place to see, like, motion picture porn.  Would you have a fucking projector and pull that out with the screen and your home movies  and then pop in a fucking porno film? 
[02:52:30]  I wouldn't even know where to get a porno film.  I don't know what this dark age that you're talking about is.  It was the dark ages.  It was a time.  Dude, it was the dark ages, bro.  There was no fucking way to watch moving pornography.  You got to get magazines.  That's true.  You could catch some softcore shit on, like, Cinema 100 on your cable provider thing with  turning a key like fucking war games. 
[02:53:00]  They got to, I mean, thank God.  I will say this.  There are some generous people out there that upload great porn for free for you to watch.  Yeah.  And that's what I do now is that that uploaded any point, any category.  Hey, I'm in the mood for cream pie today.  Doom.  I'm in the mood for fucking Asian.  And it's just a movie on there.  The weirdest thing is we went through this phase with the internet where at the beginning 
[02:53:30]  you could get fucking porno.  It was very, it took a long time to download shit, but believe me, you would wait.  Right.  And then you'd get it and watch it.  And it was like, fucking look, it was great.  It's porno.  And it was free.  Then everything cost money.  They shut the fucking doors down.  You could not get on a set.  They try to taunt you by saying, hey, free here.  Put in your credit card.  Right.  And everything was like paid, pay for.  So you couldn't see anything for a while on the internet as far as porno went, unless 
[02:54:00]  you knew news groups and stuff like that.  And then, now, it's back to being free porno again and at lightning download speeds.  Because of Kazaa and all those sites that were stealing it.  Have you guys got any good free movie ones?  Free movie sites?  Regular movie ones?  I got movies slash on demand slash dot TV.  Like regular movies, right?  I watch.  You stream like.  I fucking watch Notorious, Friday the 13th.  Everything. 
[02:54:30]  How is that?  I don't know.  I mean, I don't understand how that's even done.  It's illegal.  Free pass dot TV.  It's completely illegal, right?  I didn't fucking.  It's on.  Motherfucker.  I didn't make the.  You're not even downloading.  You're just streaming it, right?  I'm just watching a movie.  Yeah.  They shut down watch dash movies dot net or whatever was one.  And they shut it down.  It was like, you know, you just go and watch.  I watch Notorious on that one.  Then one day it was just gone.  You know when you type in a web address and it pulls up that Roadrunner screen?  Yeah, yeah.  So.  I watch Valkyrie. 
[02:55:00]  Just streaming.  You watched it?  On a computer.  Yeah.  Was it good?  On what?  Yeah.  On what?  I thought it was pretty good.  On a PC.  On a computer.  What's the name of the name?  Just streaming it from one of those sites.  What's the name of the name?  I don't know.  What's the name of the site?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Yeah, Patrice.  Tell me that site that you just said.  Movies.  I don't.  What's the slash?  Yeah, just the slash.  Everyone knows that.  The middle slash.  Not the underscore.  Oh, a dash.  The dash.  Dash.  Dash and slash. 
[02:55:30]  Very different.  That's what somebody cursed me out about.  And I told him, I'll go fuck yourself, nigga.  I'll be talking to me like this asshole.  Dash is the dash.  Okay, ready?  Mm-hmm.  Movies.  Dash.  Mm-hmm.  On.  Dash.  Demand.  Dot.  TV.  All right.  Fuck it.  Wow.  How's the quality?  Oh, some of them are phantasmagorical.  Yeah, you got to look.  Some of them suck.  A couple of them that I was watching off of some of these sites. 
[02:56:00]  You hear someone crunching popcorn in front and people coughing.  And then sometimes people are taking their seats, so you feel like their head in your screen.  It's like mystery science theater.  But then occasionally you get a good copy.  Yeah, it's pretty, let me see.  Danny's pulling it up.  Yeah, they got, look it.  What is it?  Oh, hey, mall cop.  You know, you just go on there and.  But aren't someone going to get in Dutch for that?  Huh?  Isn't that against the law? 
[02:56:30]  OVguide?  I don't know if it's against the law.  If it's against the law, they got to find that motherfucker first.  OVguide.com, apparently.  How was Friday the 13th?  It seems like you can't really stream on this, so it looks like it would be an illegal download.  No, look.  Wait.  Turn it back this way.  Oh, you got to download, download?  Watch trailer or download now?  No, go down to free pad where it says free.  Up.  Go up.  See where it says free.  Down.  Scroll.  No, I don't see where it says free anything.  Look at.  Turn it this way.  Danny just swings around. 
[02:57:00]  Go here, motherfucker.  Click the second one.  The second one?  Second blue line.  Click the second one.  But that's an external link, though.  No, no, no.  Click it.  And there's something wrong with the site right now, too, by the way.  All right, because this is a completely different site now.  Now go to.  Yeah, but this isn't the site anymore.  Fucking Danny, stop.  Just stop.  Just stop.  Yeah, just stop.  Oh, look at all the pop-ups coming up now.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, this is great now.  Oh, fuck the wood doctor.  The wood doctor.  Click out of it.  The fuck is the wood doctor?  What is the wood doctor?  It isn't even porno. 
[02:57:30]  You would think it was.  That's usually a mouth.  Can you put it up here so I can see it so I don't have to keep telling you the fucking...  Jesus, fuck face.  I don't think...  I'm trying to help you.  Just let me help you.  Let me help you help you.  But Patrice, Danny is saying that a lot of pop-ups are showing.  Fucking...  I'm saying that this is a completely illegal website also.  They got commercials on these fucking things.  We're definitely not doing this.  Huh?  No, that one ain't working.  He's saying it's an illegal website.  What?  And that illegal website can't be...  Patrice, it's not true.  Doesn't sound like this thing is on the up, Patrice. 
[02:58:00]  It is on the up.  Doesn't sound like, yeah, I think Joe's right.  I'd like to get the skinny on this.  Yeah.  I can fucking say www.littlechildren.com, nigga.  It's fucking movies on the list.  That's probably a nice one.  Uh-oh.  I wonder what that'll get you.  I made that up by the way.  I don't think I've ever typed that one in.  I'll bet you that www.littlechildren.com is probably a fucking innocent site.  Is it?  Yeah.  What is it?  Go to it.  Danny, close the thing.  Wait, I just want to see...  I got to go to Little Children.  I want to see what this is. 
[02:58:30]  I guarantee you it's something cute.  Don't fucking Pete Townsend.  Cute and cuddly.  No, it's not.  Yeah, I guarantee you.  Of course it is.  It's a bunch of links.  It's just being saved.  Okay, click out of a...  Okay, go to...  Who got that one?  Go down.  Some creep.  Yeah.  I want Little Children.  Oh, Uncle Paul, you did not.  I came in on a dot com boom.  Go down.  Go down.  To the...  Second, that one.  Over to the left.  Up.  Okay, these are Google results.  Right there.  Yeah, because this site is down for a second. 
[02:59:00]  But they give you other sites.  There's a bunch of these fucking sites.  Click that, Danny.  Oh, it's just...  That's the one I went to.  It's a portal.  Just click it.  No, Danny.  The other one.  He's going to click the one he wants to.  Okay, here you go.  Bye, Danny.  You just do what you want to do.  Patrice, I clicked the one that you wanted, and a whole bunch of pop-ups came up.  Danny, click the one that I fucking just said.  Which one?  The second one.  That one.  There you go.  Click that.  Click.  Go down.  And now it goes there.  Don't click nothing, Danny.  I didn't click nothing the first time.  Go to part one.  Click...  Where is it?  Down.  Click on that. 
[02:59:30]  Just X that, Danny.  Mm-hmm.  Exit.  There you go.  Go to...  Down.  Pop-ups keep coming up.  To part one.  No, this computer works.  I'm not clicking on anything.  Part one.  Part one.  Yeah, I see it.  I'm not clicking it.  No.  I like my computers to work the right way.  What a fucking shit.  What would happen if you clicked on it?  Probably nothing, but I don't really feel like being...  Probably nothing, but I don't want to.  Fucking homo.  The rapture.  Do you do it at your house?  I do, stupid.  I do it at my house.  Nothing's wrong. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  No infection on your computer.  That's why I've been trying to help you.  Stop living a scared life.  Stop being horrified.  So I should just watch illegal movies on my computer, and that'll make my life better?  There's not a fucking ball out there that said, yeah, you go, Danny.  You embarrass me.  Patrice, I just want...  I don't want to fuck up the computer.  It works.  Don't make your voice higher like you're making a stand.  Just be there.  Just be where you are.  I didn't call you back.  Ooh.  Wow.  Wow.  This is good radio. 
[03:00:30]  Good one.  Good one.  Oh, so it's better radio to watch a movie on the television.  Okay.  Yes.  Actually, it's kind of good.  I'm new to it.  Exactly.  Yes.  Guys, I don't like when it gets like this in here.  It's not like anything.  Oh, look.  Look, there's a new offer from Windows Internet.  Sure.  Get out of it.  That's good, though.  That's helpful.  Yeah.  Get out of it.  I love offers.  Get out of it.  Patrice just keeps saying, get out of it.  Get out of it.  Every time he says that, a new pop-up comes out.  Danny, look at that new congratulations movie. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Let's see.  I've won today's contest in New York.  I have seen it.  Click out of it.  Click out of it.  Click out of the iPhone.  I got to go.  Yeah, dude.  Click out of the iPhone.  You want an iPhone?  The way I get to choose, though.  It's either an iPhone, a 360, a Wii, or a Toys R Us gift card.  Just click the box that makes it the whole screen.  You're getting no more pop-ups.  There you go.  That's what we're watching.  The full movie.  Screening copy.  Wow.  Nice.  Oh, boy.  That's good.  It's a screening copy.  Oh, boy.  The screen just shattered.  Something's wrong.  Is this mall cop? 
[03:01:30]  Yeah.  You actually found the site?  They're going to fine us for $250,000.  Yeah.  Looks really good, too.  Not me.  Danny.  I like the timer.  They're not going to fine me.  They're going to fine Danny.  I don't watch this shit.  Danny does.  Do you know there's actually an option to watch this in a lower quality?  I had no idea.  That's when the script just comes up and you read it.  I was just going to say.  What is that little timer for in the middle, Danny? 
[03:02:00]  That's like a pre-production version of...  That's before they even color correct things.  Jim, I believe that's called time code.  Sympti.  This is the audition.  That's a Sympti.  It's the audition.  Yeah, but you see, here's the problem.  Patricia says...  Patricia just goes, oh, well, there's all these sites where you can watch free movies  on.  This isn't even a movie site, though.  This is just Lincoln...  Don't try to...  Don't attack me.  I'm not attacking you.  Like, I'm the substitute teacher.  You would never talk to Opie like this.  You would leave him alone.  If he told you to put up your legal site, you'd just fucking do it without opening your 
[03:02:30]  fucking mouth.  Now, don't try to get tough with me.  I'm just saying, this isn't even a movie site.  Anybody could upload anything to a potentially malicious website.  What am I?  The fucking...  That's all I'm saying.  What am I?  The impotent lieutenant that sits here and watches the sergeants yell it out?  No, no.  Fuck you.  I'm the fucking boss.  Exactly.  I'm the boss here.  But that's what I'm saying.  Danny's voice just got higher to attack me about...  I'm telling you this video.  I don't give a fuck.  I put it on my computer if it's illegal and all this shit.  But don't get all, like, fuck that with me.  If there was an illegal download, there will be an investigation, but I need you two to 
[03:03:00]  stand down.  That's true.  Appreciate that.  I'm just saying.  Yeah, because it's not like anybody's ever been sued over the internet for watching illegal  movies or music.  Oh, literal Jim.  Yeah, let's just broadcast breaking the law.  But if that is the case, just don't do it.  Well, I wasn't going to.  Don't make me care.  We are investigative reporters.  That's illegal.  Yeah, we're just investigating. 
[03:03:30]  Just like Pete Townsend was just doing investigating.  He sure was.  Yeah, that's all we're doing.  He happened to spill tapioca on his screen and keyboard a lot.  All right.  Fucking creep.  Google this website, childsasshole.com.  But the whole point of this, though, is that this isn't even on a movie.  This is not part of any movie site.  It's just anybody can upload it to any file sharing website.  No one has a fucking movie site.  So you never know where you're going is my point, though.  Right.  But what do you know anywhere where you're going?  That is not the way life is.  That's true. 
[03:04:00]  Life is very, very random.  What do you talk about?  It's really the journey, not the destination.  How did you find out all this shit was fucked up?  You found it was fucked up because you used to do that.  Now you know.  Now you know you learn the hard way at some point.  Yeah, because a website that I know and trust is something called zshare.net.tv slash.  You know what I'm saying?  Why do you trust that one?  It's just something I would never go to.  It's something that I would never recommend.  I'm not taking your recommendations.  I'm just, well, that's why we can have a conversation.  How fun would this be if I just agreed with you? 
[03:04:30]  You're spiraling out of control.  I'm not trusting you.  I'm a very, I drink tea and I watch this site.  You don't go to it and you're fucking an alcoholic.  That's true.  Why would I listen to you?  Well, you got to bring up his alcoholism.  I'm not going to fucking listen to an alcoholic with some type of thing where he's holding  on to his, his, his, uh, uh, what's the word I'm looking for?  His fucking thyroid.  Yeah.  I'm not going to go for it, Danny.  I'm not going for it.  I'm trying to help you out. 
[03:05:00]  I don't have to wear velour sweatshirts and fucking sparkle jackets and Indiana Jones hands.  What's the point?  Wow.  Jesus, this is like awful mean of you.  I'm saying you're alcoholism.  I'm just saying you're shitting on me and I don't understand why you're shitting on me.  Don't get mad at me.  What are you mad at me?  Don't get mad at me.  I feel your energy.  Y'all shitting on me.  I want you to talk a little bit.  Little bit.  I'm not shitting on him.  Little bit.  Nah, nah, nah.  Nah, nah.  Why?  Can I say why I'm shitting on him?  Little bit.  Why?  This is shitting.  I'm not even making me a victim.  I'm getting nervous.  I'm going to tell you why. 
[03:05:30]  If you call it shitting, I'm not shitting.  Now go home and get your fucking sparkle jacket.  I'm very good.  Go get the fucking bedazzler.  I'm going to get your fucking spyware.  You're very good at context.  Context.  I'm very good at sniffing out vibes.  Yeah.  Okay?  I love Danny.  And Danny knows I love him.  Right?  We always hurt the ones we love.  Danny is in deep shit.  His soul is in deep shit.  And he's attacking me because he knows he can. 
[03:06:00]  But he's not.  He comes here with his dumb face.  He's listening to everything.  See?  That was his example.  This is because I didn't want to go to a potentially malicious website.  I am now a shithead.  No, no, no, no.  It's the way.  And I have a dumb face.  It's the way.  It's the way Danny didn't go to a potentially malicious website.  Yeah.  It was just.  But.  It was.  It was like fuck that.  Danny has a lot of fuck you.  But you took that personally.  Because it is personal.  Because he's abusing me.  I don't think it was personal. 
[03:06:30]  Yes.  I think he didn't want to jeopardize his computer.  Let me tell you something.  If you said.  Do that.  Yeah.  What do you think he would have said?  There is.  He would have said.  It would have been 80 people.  And again.  I'm not you.  I'm not you.  He probably would have advised me.  It would have advised me.  It would have been at least Steve.  Or 47 people I've never seen before.  A small man.  This small man that's around.  He would come in.  And he would hold something up.  And say probably not a good idea.  Right.  Cut it out.  Yeah. 
[03:07:00]  Because there's a chain of command.  He wouldn't have said fuck that motherfucker.  No.  And that way.  There's a chain of command.  I'm telling you.  It's shit rolls downhill.  That's right.  And I'm not.  I'm not the guy who gets shitted on as the shit rolls downhill.  I'm the guy that steps to the side and lets somebody else who wants to get shit on.  But I can feel that it's the trickle down theory with Danny.  He's going to say he's going to get emotional where he can.  But if this was another situation, he wouldn't have did that. 
[03:07:30]  I think you're giving him credit for having judgment.  I'm just saying.  I think in a weird way he's saying, you know, I can't believe you'd listen to your boss, but you won't listen to me.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying that.  That was another little smarmy way of doing that.  And then when he did that, he was looking at you to just go, right, boss?  No.  I didn't tell him to do anything against his boss.  It was the way you said no to me.  You didn't say, no, this is a bad idea.  All right.  I get it.  You didn't get your way.  We had a little argument about it. 
[03:08:00]  No, no, no.  See, more smarmy shit.  That was smarmy.  It's smarmy.  But the other stuff wasn't.  I picked up the smarminess ten times before you finally said that was smarmy.  But he'd been doing that the whole time.  But you've been abusive the entire time.  Absolutely not.  Nope.  You don't think you've been...  Immediately play it back.  Immediately I got abusive once Danny started to go.  You don't think that you...  And then he goes, you're just mad because I didn't call you back.  Well, that was after you guys were already fully involved in the...  No, no, no, it wasn't.  So when is jokes okay and when is jokes not okay? 
[03:08:30]  It's not...  Nope, I'm not going there.  I'm not saying that jokes are not okay.  I just know you, Danny.  You all love jokes.  Yeah, I just know you.  Where's the playback when we want to scrutinize what Patrice said?  You know, you had that playback on me in ten fucking seconds earlier today.  Yeah, because you know why?  It will prove that Danny's wrong.  No, I think that was a process.  That was a whole process that just happened there.  It wasn't a one-line thing like Joe did earlier.  I'll tell you why.  I picked it up immediately.  It was personal.  Because we're on the...  Not personal. 
[03:09:00]  Danny doesn't like me for some reason today.  No.  Oh, no way.  We're on the radio.  So if we're doing something that is potentially...  Don't make him a fucking victim either.  Because this is Danny's big chance to be the fucking ass that he really wants to be and  never gets a chance to.  Now you go ahead, sweetie.  That's right.  Because I am the opportunity for you to be an ass.  Just admit it.  That you've never talked like this.  Ever.  You just fucking...  You get things up.  And you just... 
[03:09:30]  Yeah, but I don't think anybody responsible would ask me to stream an illegal movie on the  radio.  That's all I'm saying.  That's how he switched up.  So I'm sorry I had a decision.  Have you never been asked to do anything unresponsible or irresponsible on this show?  Of course.  Well, then shut the fuck up.  Then you didn't...  That ends my fucking argument.  You just do it.  And you got what you wanted.  So why are we still...  Why are we still talking about it?  See, there you go.  I'm not falling for white verbal tricks.  Oh, the race card.  Keep white out of the race card. 
[03:10:00]  I thought we were all just...  You can't get people.  We were all just people for a second.  Black people don't have...  You see how mad he's getting just because he couldn't...  That's because he couldn't steal something?  You're having one.  You're black and you're having this argument.  That's what's frustrating me is I have to have a white guy's argument.  Black guys don't.  We don't.  You know we don't.  That's true.  We do not.  They just steal and hate each other.  We steal and somebody gets shot.  Someone would have been laying in a puddle of their own blood by now.  You're right.  You're right.  You don't argue like this.  But we wouldn't have a verbal song and dance when one of us knows we're wrong.  Verbal.  It's who stepped on my platform shoes and where's my gun.  Motherfucker. 
[03:10:30]  I'm recording a diss track.  That part in your afro sucks.  But to get to the point is the fact that my point was ended by saying, have you been  asked to do something irresponsible?  At first, and I'm really good at it because I've been to court before.  He goes, you know, you would be smart enough not to be asked to do...  What was that?  A little jab at me because I'm white.  I've never been to court before.  Not to ask something irresponsible.  At first he said, I'm too irresponsible.  No one responsible would ask something like that.  Have you ever been asked to do something irresponsible on the show? 
[03:11:00]  Yes.  Ends his argument and then he reversed it like into something else.  No, the thing is because there's a protocol on this show.  And I understand if Opie was sitting there and said, pull that up.  Yes, Danny would do that because he would have the wrath of Opie on him if he didn't  do that.  Exactly.  And I understand there.  And the wrath of Opie is a lot worse than the wrath of Patrice.  Because he doesn't work for me.  You can't do anything to make his life miserable.  But the point is that if he...  But he didn't place it like that.  He said it was irresponsible. 
[03:11:30]  Why should he have to preface the reason or anything?  But what I'm saying...  But he still does...  That doesn't mean...  Right?  This is what I mean about the trickle down theory.  That it doesn't...  I didn't ask him to do something like he was my employee.  I asked him.  I said, oh, just throw it up because that's what Danny does.  He gets the thing, throws it up.  I wasn't telling him as my boss.  But if I was saying to him to do something that was fucked up, he could have told me  in a way that would have kept me from fucking saying...  Instead of me being stupid ass thief, I could have just been like, hey man, that shit is 
[03:12:00]  not good.  Oh, my bad.  There you go.  But it was about respect.  It wasn't about, I'm his boss.  I think because we were just kind of rolling on it as it was happening.  So it's very hard to...  I just wanted to let him know what he was doing because sometimes we do things and we  don't know.  You've got to be let known.  Well, Danny, do you agree with that?  Because you have kind of an incredulous look on your face.  I just don't understand why it's like...  I can't believe this became real all of a sudden.  It was just like such a...  It's like a dumb...  I just didn't want to...  I didn't want to click through and potentially fuck up a computer I use every day. 
[03:12:30]  And he's getting on my ass, turning it into a fucking black versus white situation  because I just wanted a computer to work.  I'm not going to let Danny...  Tomorrow.  ...self-destruct.  I'm just going to not let it happen.  Ladies and gentlemen...  Patrice O'Neal is hosting The Worst of Opian Anthony.  Hey, it's The Worst of Opian Anthony, hosted by myself, Mr. Patrice O'Neal.  And we have more of this stupid shit coming up after the break.  Ladies and gentlemen...  Ladies and gentlemen...  Shut up and listen.  It's The Worst of Opian Anthony with Patrice O'Neal. 
[03:13:00]  Let's begin.  Hey, this is Patrice O'Neal, and you're listening to the best of Opian Anthony.  Uh, hey, check this out.  This is, uh...  This is when me and Danny are still going at it over this some...  It's the same bullshit.  We're still going at it about this computer and download...  But I think some real shit came out.  I think this is some shit he wanted to say to me for years.  That's what I think.  You know what?  The more I think about it, the more I want to slap the shit out that nigga. 
[03:13:30]  But I don't.  Because I'm not a bully.  I'm not a bully.  I'm not a fighter.  I'm a lover.  And I love you, Danny.  I love you and your fucking ridiculous wig hair that you won't put any kind of moisturizer in.  Fucking bitch.  Broadcasting The Worst of Opian Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neal.  All right.  Wow.  We can take phone calls.  Let's go.  Let's go to Tommy in Jersey.  Hey, Tommy.  What's up, man?  Hey, how you doing?  Welcome aboard, Tom. 
[03:14:00]  What do you got there, my friend?  Patrice, I'm sick of you, man.  Everything you say, every point you say...  Race?  ...you're speaking as far out of the world where it's like...  It's called analogies.  It helps you understand because you're not communicating correctly.  What's your point?  You're tired of me?  Keep going.  Exactly.  Get it off your chest.  And it helps you to understand, doesn't it?  It helps you to relate.  I try to help people like you understand how to communicate. 
[03:14:30]  You're tired of me.  I guarantee, I guarantee, if I let you keep talking, you'll say tired of me six times.  Go.  You'll talk about women in relationships for 20 minutes and make no point.  Go ahead.  You'll talk yourself in circles.  I got to disagree on that one.  You're just a guy who had the opportunity to hate me.  Go ahead.  Because Patrice's relationship shows are very good.  You're just fucking stupid.  And Patrice, I like you.  No, you don't.  Don't try to switch it.  That's more white tricks.  You don't like me.  White tricks. 
[03:15:00]  That's more white tricks.  I wish I knew what all those good white tricks were.  It's white tricks, man.  It's tricky white shit.  You give white people too much credit, man.  I know.  No, he doesn't.  Here's a, no, I don't.  Not enough tricks.  What are you trying to do?  He has an emotion.  He has an emotion, right?  Yeah.  And once he runs out of emotion, this is what girls do.  This is why I'm very key to your life.  Calling him a chick.  No man runs on emotion.  We run on logic.  You're running on emotion.  And as your emotions die down, your argument gets weaker.  And then you eventually agree with me. 
[03:15:30]  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.  Just be honest.  Look at how soft you're getting now.  Look at how angry you was when you first called.  But you see how, you see what he just did though?  Look how, look how, look at, you're agreeing with this guy, man.  No, I'm just saying, no, I'm just saying, you just did to Tommy and Jersey what you did  to me.  Any little thing that became a disagreement, it immediately became a, it was black versus  white.  I didn't, I didn't do it because I'm white and you're black all of a sudden.  And you're giving it to him too.  No, I'm saying.  He's just saying that he disagrees with you.  White people are amazing.  I'm not saying what his disagreement is white.  Just cut your sentence there. 
[03:16:00]  White people are amazing.  Exactly.  Went to the moon.  I'm saying.  That's right.  I'm saying it's not what, it's not a white people thing.  It's white tricks, you just said.  It's white tricks.  Easy.  Stop trying to make me like that.  I just, I'm not.  I'm just using your words.  I am.  I'm going to tell you why.  Because, because a lot of times white people, what they do, you don't do it.  Norton doesn't do it.  But sometimes if I catch you doing white things, which is, you have an argument and then you'll 
[03:16:30]  place yourself in a position to be a victim.  He just did it.  He goes, Patrice, this is to calm down, old screaming ass nigga.  Hey, I love you as he's telling me I ain't shit.  No, nigga, look.  It's a trick, dude.  You just don't know you're doing it.  You're too dumb to know that you were raised to do it with your whiteness.  No, I disagree with that completely.  Raised to do what?  All right, well.  See, there we go.  He don't even know how to respond to that.  I just want to see.  What?  Let's take somebody else.  Matt from Long Island, who has pretty much the same point, but maybe he's not as big 
[03:17:00]  an asshole.  All right, fair enough.  Let's see.  Matt, what's up, man?  Tired of laying around on the floor all day, are you?  Oh, Jimmy.  That's his name.  If I may get a word in with the great Patrice.  Patrice, I am a big fan.  I do think you're hysterically...  But there's a button.  That's another light trick, by the way.  More light trick.  You do magic.  More light tricks.  Juana.  Juana. 
[03:17:30]  Give that...  You're Puerto Rican.  He's Puerto Rican?  It is.  Don't trust him.  The bottom line is this.  I don't know.  I think it came off of Patrice's esteemed weekend, that banana's a couple of days.  A couple of miles south of the one in Poughkeepsie, where he had such an esteemed weekend that  he came in this morning and stated, actually...  I said my self-esteem.  I said my...  Lower on the totem pole to the show.  I'll tell you what that means.  I'll tell you what it means.  I know I said that. 
[03:18:00]  What it means is this.  No, no.  What it means is this.  Is that on...  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  We're not going to hear you defend fucking Travis, motherfucker.  I know what you're doing at.  You don't have to keep yapping.  What I mean by that is that I'm a personality, and a personality on any fucking show that  entertains people is higher on the totem pole than the fucking cameraman, than the fucking  editor, than the phone fucking guy. 
[03:18:30]  You hear me, motherfucker?  Yes.  I do.  Exactly.  Now, enjoy a fucking show with Travis just answering the phone.  Shut the fuck up.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Thank you, Matt.  You know what?  Without Travis, and I'm not disrespecting Travis, I'm disrespecting your goofy point.  Talk shit at the airport.  Lower on the fucking totem pole.  And I don't mean that with disrespect.  I mean it that I'm a fucking personality on a fucking radio show.  All right?  Who's more important, Phil Donahue or the fucking guy that holds Phil Donahue's, who 
[03:19:00]  tells Phil Donahue what's next?  What if Phil Donahue says, hey, Google image some kiddie porn.  I'm not going to, what?  So because he's Phil Donahue, I should listen to him?  Wait a minute.  See, this is what you did.  Something else white.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Because if it was DeRosa, I wouldn't use the same argument.  I'm not criticizing Phil Donahue's hair.  It's very white.  Go ahead.  I don't want it.  You're right.  I did.  I used a white crime, and I shouldn't have it.  That's right.  White trick.  What you just did, Danny, is you took it from the movies thing, but you switched it 
[03:19:30]  into the child thing, which is, this is, I mean, that was unnecessary what you just  did.  I felt what you just did.  Now, we were talking about the movies on demand thing, the child porn thing, which is, like,  that was the joke part, but the movies thing wasn't a joke part.  You're taking it, and here's another thing you do that my fucking girl does.  Because you were being very serious, and you tried to play me like I was the one that  switched it into seriousness.  You got serious, motherfucker.  Because you just dwelled on it.  It was just a dumb thing.  It went on forever.  Did you get serious, but you tried to put serious on me first? 
[03:20:00]  Well, it works both ways, doesn't it?  If you can get serious with me, why can't I make it serious?  But you won't just say yes or no.  I promise you, you ask me a yes or no question, I'll ask you yes or no.  What's the question?  I'd love to know.  Did you try to make it like I was the one that was serious, and then...  You were serious, yes.  No, no, no.  Yes, you were serious.  You turned it serious first.  You played it like I was serious.  You were serious first, Danny.  Is that true or false?  Yeah, I was serious because I didn't...  All right, fair enough!  Because I didn't...  Because there's no because!  Yeah, there is no because!  Because reasons are valid. 
[03:20:30]  But why, when you put it that I was the one that caused it to be serious, you played  it like I took it there, but you're the one that took it serious.  That's what I'm saying.  I just want a computer to work.  And you started giving me...  And then it was white tricks and fucking voodoo magic.  That was later.  That was later.  You guys both got serious at the same time.  Oh, I don't know, Joe.  Way to be in the middle.  Yeah, ride the fence.  I argue a lot.  Exactly.  Let's just encourage the listeners to download product keys and software. 
[03:21:00]  Who cares what they do?  Is this my fault?  No, but who's the one that might get in trouble for it?  I don't know.  Not you.  I don't know.  That's the point.  How about Tugboat on 9?  Let's talk to Tugboat.  Wow.  Tugboat, what's up?  Hopefully, you're 50 miles up the coast of Florida.  Helping out a couple of that minimum.  Go ahead, T.B.  I'm John T.B.  Hey, listen.  Actually, I'm all in a load of trash to Laredo.  But listen...  Well, I'm sitting in a room full of it.  Patrice is...  I got to come down on Patrice's side, man. 
[03:21:30]  Patrice is the talent.  Danny's just got some kind of a head trip going on.  White tricks.  White tricks.  White tricks.  Ooh.  Mm.  So when Patrice does that, he's just a crazy nigger.  I'm just a Connecticut chimpanzee when I'm yelling that.  Oh, shit.  But when Danny does it, it's a reason.  You know what?  That's what I'm saying.  This is what I mean by the white thing, is that it's a reason for him to be doing what  he's doing.  He just...  There's no reason for me.  He looks...  Patrice, you look for every little thing to just pry apart and pick apart. 
[03:22:00]  It was just a dumb...  It was a dumb little movie thing.  You caught an attitude with me earlier when...  Because I didn't call you back this weekend when you called.  You left me a nasty message.  Yes.  I was joking.  That's what I do.  Okay, when we...  Well, you do it all the time, I guess.  But when we're being friendly...  Will you shut the fuck up?  Is that what I'm doing?  Let me be on your side.  Is that...  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's right.  Go ahead, man.  You're right.  Go ahead.  He's on my side.  Somebody let him go.  Danny's hanging out at Anthony's house.  He's got his own bedroom there.  So Danny thinks he's above his station.  Right.  That's right. 
[03:22:30]  He hears it.  Act like an employee.  He hears what I feel.  Thank you, Tugboat.  Hey, Tugboat.  You fucking retard.  There you go.  And you've got in your whole body.  Anthony.  Well, I'm just saying, you want me to...  He wants me to...  He sleeps on the couch.  No, no, no.  That gives me...  Can I...  Can I...  My heart.  Oh, shit.  Patrice, keep rolling, brother.  I love you.  Even though I am a 63-year-old white man.  Thank you.  So you're gonna go fuck yourselves.  Goodbye.  Tugboat wants me to act like an employee, and I thought that's what I was doing.  Sorry, Tugboat.  What's up?  No, it's your fault. 
[03:23:00]  How is it my fault?  It's...  He feels...  He has a friend in Anthony.  Yeah.  And, um...  It's like reading the message for us.  Go ahead.  This is why that guy...  Look, I'm not taking anybody's side in this.  Of course you're not, Joe.  I would just...  This is why that...  Hey, you know, I want to keep right here in the middle and make any waves.  This is why that guy's a fucking moron.  Because it's easy to sit in his goddamn truck or whatever and make a...  Why didn't you say it was easy, those other two that was against me, to be the morons? 
[03:23:30]  And make it...  I didn't think they were bright either.  But more white tricks.  I'm just saying, like...  That is true.  These white tricks.  The guy's sitting there going...  I'm surrounded by white tricks.  The guy's sitting there going, do your fucking job, Danny.  Patrice, if you showed up at that dude's job and said, why don't you do this, he'd tell  you to go fuck yourself.  That's the truth.  But it's the thing is that this is what's wrong with soundbites and all this stuff.  Look, I'm down with Travis, down with Danny.  I'm just saying, when you pick up...  Who is Travis, by the way?  Travis Anderson.  He's a useless piece of shit over there behind the glass.  What bothers me...  What bothers me...  That's fucking nothing?  Yeah.  What bothers me is just... 
[03:24:00]  Tell him not to look me in the eye.  Look, it's context.  I know that, look, Danny, you can tell the difference between somebody yelling at you, right?  Or yelling with you, and it's something...  Or you can feel something else.  Because I'm feeling something else, and a lot of times I want to get down to the absolute  truth of what's really going on.  So I'll egg a motherfucker to get to this point of anger so some truth can come out.  I'm not taking it personal, but it could be something, because Danny's not a sharing guy. 
[03:24:30]  Well, let's get...  Danny's not sharing.  Why don't we hear the audio?  Hold on.  Two things.  Steve...  I would love to get Steve's take, because I'm sure Steve has been paying attention.  And also...  Holy shit.  I actually have been.  Danny's not going to say...  He's not going to fucking say to me, like, hey, man, you know.  But I would reach out to Danny like that.  What wouldn't I say to you, though?  You wouldn't say that something's wrong.  We got to get the...  Why don't we play the audio from the beginning before, just so we can see who started what?  You got it, Derek?  Derek has it.  Are you upset that he said no, or are you upset about the way he said no? 
[03:25:00]  No, no, no.  It has no...  It has nothing to do with anything.  It's Danny's energy.  It's not that I'm trying to tell...  I'm not coming at him like a boss.  I would come at him like, oh, movies...  We're talking about movies.  The context was this and that.  Danny brought in, you're mad at me because I didn't call, the message I left.  I didn't fucking...  I leave those kind of messages for Danny.  If I call him, I'll leave some fucked up message.  It's like if we had an argument, right?  Yeah.  And then I always leave, hey, sweetie, right?  And then, you know, you're a fag. 
[03:25:30]  You're always leaving me messages saying, sweetie.  Like, what?  What's going on?  Like, it's going in that place.  That's because something's going on with Danny inside that has got to get out.  It's some evil.  Is something going on?  And it's not nothing personal with me.  I know something's wrong with Danny, and he's not going to tell me.  Is something going on?  Something's going on.  What's going on?  He got that look of, what?  Is something's wrong?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't have that with Danny.  I went to the website.  It was Paul Blart.  It made me mad.  It has nothing to do with this. 
[03:26:00]  Well, Derek, you got the audio, right?  It's something else.  Derek has the audio.  Derek's got the audio.  I honestly don't remember.  I wasn't paying attention.  I think you're reading far too much.  I really just didn't.  I don't think I am.  I didn't want to play a movie from a website I'm unfamiliar with just because you say so.  I want a computer.  Well, you should have.  Because Salsa said so?  I'm just saying, I got to use this machine every day.  I can't download a movie.  You should have not.  Fuck Matthew, boss.  You don't work.  Yeah, but you were good.  I told you not to go to that site.  Because the thing is, I was giving you shit, but the thing is, if you had to fucking not 
[03:26:30]  did it like you didn't want to, I still might have gave you shit, but you would have been  happy not doing what you wanted.  I'd hear it.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Here it is.  So you meant you were manipulating me with your black tricks.  That's what it is.  Maybe I don't know what the black tricks are.  Whatever black tricks are.  Here's what we'll do.  We'll play.  Make money disappear real quick.  We'll play the tape now with hindsight.  Ruining white pussies.  Caving them in.  Wait.  I'm coming reading things. 
[03:27:00]  I just heard someone say hindsight.  Just hatred.  Never get a chance to really explore Patrice's hatred.  That's why I don't look at fucking MySpace.  Oh, you're just a fool.  That guy, emotional man, sickened me.  Well, it's split down the middle.  We got it tired of hearing Danny's voice guy there.  Who would say that?  Patrice is acting like a teen girl.  Oh, please.  Patrice is uppity.  Uppity.  Uppity.  Oh, shit.  Oh, so all Patrice is doing was trying to help, and that was sarcasm in there, of  course. 
[03:27:30]  Patrice just can't let someone finish a point.  Ooh.  And Patrice has no rights in this situation.  Go ahead.  All right, let me hear that one.  And I don't.  Mike.  Hey, how's it going?  Hey, man.  Yeah.  Thanks for letting me talk into you all day.  Jimmy, it's a person.  Oh, it's Mike.  It's his name.  Not that Patrice was actually trying to help.  Patrice is the help.  Patrice just kind of shows up and does a little bit of help and, you know, whatever. 
[03:28:00]  Travis actually works there.  The other guy actually works there.  I forget his name, whatever his name is.  Patrice.  You know what's great about this guy's voice, which is scary?  He has.  This is the white person I've been looking for.  This is the holy grail of white people.  It's the reasonable sounding racist.  You mean the guy that, yes, let me.  The guy that works hard all day and says, no, you can't have a job, but it's not racist.  I want to find this guy.  This is the guy we can't find. 
[03:28:30]  You seem to have gotten a lot more racial since Obama's been in office, which I don't understand.  Are you fucking kidding me?  Yeah, a little bit.  And you've gotten a lot, what, less?  No, I figured you would get less, but I'd get more.  No, let me tell you something.  I'm like the aliens from Independence Day.  No peace.  No peace.  No peace.  Because I know that that guy exists.  Kill.  You fucking, I'll let all the black people that, I'll let them be happy about it.  Okay.  Because I'm not falling for the banana in the tailpipe.  Yeah, no, I'll get you.  This is what it is. 
[03:29:00]  Because there's too many of those guys around.  Let go home.  He is the help.  Yuckity, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck, yuck.  Come on, nigga.  So let's.  Yuckity, yuck, yuck, yuck.  So he made a point.  So I'll just, I'll just smash him because he's a white guy making sense.  No, he just called me a racist.  I mean, he called me, he was just saying racist.  You're the only one that brought race up.  No, no.  He said, I'm the help.  And it was being racial.  But it's amazing.  That's what I'm saying.  If that's the way that you interpret it, maybe you're, maybe you're the racist.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't know.  It'd be great.  That's the way I meant it.  I didn't think of it like that.  Oh, shit. 
[03:29:30]  Wait, wait, wait, listen, listen, listen.  He just said that's the way he meant it.  Listen, Danny.  Could you say that again, sir?  I'm just saying.  Sir, can you say that again?  That's the way that I meant it.  You meant it racial, right?  Well, yeah, it's called, you know, satire.  What?  Why are you talking to me?  It's called, you know, satire.  Yeah, it's racial satire, correct, sir?  This guy doesn't sound like every white guy, by the way.  He sounds like every imitation black guys do of white guys on stage.  So I was talking to my neighbor the other day, and he was like, hey, Bob, I'm clipping the edges. 
[03:30:00]  He sounds like that little green man that used to pop up on the Flintstones.  What the fuck was that guy's name?  The Great Kazoo.  Yeah, you sound like the Great Kazoo, you cunt.  Hey, Derek.  Yeah, Derek.  Do you have the audio?  Let's hear how this, with hindsight, now we can listen in, see how this transpired, and  see maybe if we could find out what really happened here.  Let's do that.  Let's listen.  Go to part one.  Click, where is it?  Down.  Click on that.  Just X that, Danny.  Mm-hmm.  X it. 
[03:30:30]  There you go.  Go to, down.  You're being a little, you're being a little, all right, we've got to stop it now.  Stop there for a second.  Let me explain something to you.  You're being combative.  Let me say something to you, though.  All right, Mr. Combative.  To make sure that this is not, which is what I am.  Yeah.  But, Danny worked with me a few times when we did the XM show.  Sure.  Danny knows that I'm not talking to him like that, like he's a fucking second class citizen.  He knows that.  I never thought you were, but the point, my point at that point in time was that there  are pop-ups happening all over the computer, and that's red flag number eight already. 
[03:31:00]  So, okay, here's, here's, at that moment, I do not want to continue this.  Maybe at this point, here's where, while we listen to this, let me just say, maybe I  will owe, I owe him this.  Um, I'm not savvy with the game of what's popping up, and I just pop up to shit.  I just learned that, uh, fucking, uh, spyware, antivirus, download viruses.  Antivirus is a bullshit.  So I'm sitting there going, oh, okay, that's new to me. 
[03:31:30]  But I have the antivirus, and I just do anything thinking the antivirus is going to say, hey,  man, this site's fucked up, man, not to me.  So my thing is, at the point, you never said, and we'll keep listening, you never said, you  said there's pop-ups and this and that.  Maybe my savvy on computers is so low that you didn't expect it to be that low.  Meaning this, that I should, when you said it should be popped up, that there's going  to be pop-ups, I should have been like, oh, never mind.  But I don't give a fuck, because pop-ups in my world, they click the fuck off.  But Danny did, and now, in Danny's defense, he did explain why he gives a fuck, because 
[03:32:00]  he doesn't want a fucked-up computer.  He didn't explain that until later.  All right, let's listen.  All right.  Let's listen.  Let's listen.  Go ahead.  We got the tape.  Let's just listen.  Back to the tape.  Where's it?  Down.  Click on that.  Just X that, Danny.  Yeah, just click another thing.  There you go.  Go to...  Down.  Pop-ups keep coming up.  To part one.  No, this computer works.  I'm not clicking on anything.  Part one.  Part one.  Yeah, I see it.  I'm not clicking it.  No.  I like my computers to work the right way. 
[03:32:30]  What a fucking...  What happened to you?  All right.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Now we're back alive again.  Okay.  Now, he did say...  Yes.  Just now.  Now, there you go.  I didn't give a fuck still.  Oh, I know you didn't give a fuck.  But there's still no, like...  My savvy on that is still, like...  I'm like, just push X.  But he kind of explained why...  He said pop-ups are coming up.  He said pop-ups are coming up.  He goes, I want a computer that works.  And I want it fucked up.  Should he have to explain to you the theory behind...  And then, why not...  Okay, if I'm so fucked up, right? 
[03:33:00]  Mm-hmm.  Why did this continue?  Why did we end up seeing some of...  Because you wouldn't let it go.  Because we were being kind to our guest.  Oh, eat ass.  Get a dick, motherfucker.  That's what I'm saying.  Why are you tricks, nigga?  Patrice, really?  That's not a...  Come on.  I have a problem.  Cut that shit off.  I have a problem with you pretending to be so computer illiterate that you have no idea  that pop-ups are potentially malicious.  I can't really...  No, no, no.  So, don't judge.  Here's what...  Now, here's what you're opening up. 
[03:33:30]  You're opening up the fact that if you don't know something that I think you should know,  that I have the right to decide how not intelligent you are on that.  I'm not savvy to where I give a fuck about pop-ups because I have the...  Well, I'm sorry that the host of WebJunk might know something about pop-ups on the internet.  That doesn't make me need to know about pop-ups.  That's a good point.  It's not about the WebJunk.  He's got a point.  Oh, look who came off the fucking fence.  Don't take a stance, Joe.  I'm trying to jump in here. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, my God.  Wow, you're crazy.  I gotta say this.  You don't need to, no, Joe.  I know, I know.  But I do want to say this much.  Regardless of either fucking guy, what you think, or whatever,  I think the simple fact of the matter is,  You don't have any shoulders or hair conditioning.  Your hair is dry, your shoulders a little.  What are you conditioning your hair with sand?  First of all, your neck is the same width as your shoulders.  Is that what's wrong?  Go ahead, first.  I think the bottom line, you know what? 
[03:34:30]  Go fuck yourself.  I was going to come to your fucking defense over here.  Of course you was.  No, I was just going to say, I understand that, like, your first responsibility is to  XM, or it's an employee of XM.  So you're saying, I didn't want to do this thing.  Right.  That, you know, whatever.  Yes.  So, is that the worst point to make?  No.  No, I'm not the big ragu hair.  Oh, shit. 
[03:35:00]  She'll be sticking your dick in Shirley Feeney.  I can't believe we're so dwelling on this.  I'm super done.  Yeah.  I wasn't even upset, but I think I know Danny a little bit.  Yeah.  Danny is in pain.  That's all my point is.  Who isn't?  Who the fuck isn't?  That's what I'm saying, but it's not my right, when I'm in pain, to, you know, come out,  like, what's the word I'm looking for, man?  What's the word? 
[03:35:30]  Project.  Project.  Yeah, but it's not my point to project on, like, put it this way.  If Danny's upset about anything.  How is this me being upset about something?  If he's upset about something.  Well, just hypothetically, if you are.  I would tell you, you might be a little upset, too, I'd tell you, because you were late over  at the CBS, right?  That might have annoyed you a little.  You might have been annoyed at something, a little bit of something, but I'm saying I'm  not the guy that you project on, even if it's not my fault, that you can't trickle 
[03:36:00]  down to fucking anger.  I just don't want, I don't want you to, whatever's, whatever's bothering you, don't  trickle it over to me.  I'm not.  And I think.  We still have to hear more, though, because we don't know if that's going to happen.  I think I'm more upset that you think I'm projecting anger onto you.  No, it's just you.  I just didn't want to click a website, Patrice.  It's not this whole big, grand scheme of things.  I just didn't want to click on something.  You're in pain.  You talk to me later.  Let's hear more.  I don't want to have an intervention on the radio.  Talk, call me.  You got my number.  I will hear a little more.  I want to hear a little more. 
[03:36:30]  You're such a fucking douche.  So far, Danny's been good.  You're such a fucking douche.  She was saying Joe's against me, too, just like this guy.  No, I'm not against you.  I'm not against you, Joe.  Don't admit it that you don't do that when you're in a pissy mood.  No.  I've seen you corner a woman backstage at a show and take her entire fucking life apart  into a rubble because you didn't like what happened on stage.  No, that's not true.  I've seen you do this.  No, you haven't.  No, you haven't.  No, you haven't.  No, you haven't.  Yes, I haven't.  Listen, when you're opening for me in San Francisco, we're going to talk. 
[03:37:00]  We're not going to do this.  Are you opening to Patrice?  Yeah, he's my opener in San Francisco.  Let's not talk about it right now.  He's my opener in San Francisco.  What did you make that face for?  What?  Why can't you open for me?  No, he made like a disgusted face.  Why?  Leave him alone.  Did he fly cross-country to the middle?  I got no problem with that.  I might not do it.  I'm here to say that I love Danny, Anthony.  Yeah, I know.  I get that.  I'm just saying, as a friend, I don't want him to be in this kind of pain. 
[03:37:30]  And he hangs out a lot with you, and I think you should talk with him and see what's going on.  Counsel him.  Just say no to one beer and say, come here, Danny.  What?  No.  So what?  There's going to be a difference between 14 and 15 beers?  That's what I'm saying.  That's 15th beer.  That's the one that does it.  That's what I'm saying.  Just chill out for a second.  And listen, put in a good movie.  Everybody loves movies here.  Sure, they do.  And put in a good movie and just say, hey, what's going on, Danny?  I'm not disagreeing with you.  I never do that with my family.  You don't even do that with anybody.  Fuck that.  Suck your pain in. 
[03:38:00]  Put it in deep and leave it there.  But see, I'm not disagreeing with you in any way when you say that.  Because my issue here is not whether or not I have things in my life.  My issue is that I just didn't want to click onto a website.  And there's no correlation between that.  But if you didn't want to do that.  There's nothing I was projecting onto you.  If I'm a participant, but this is how I, see, I relate where I try to go.  Logic is, I love logic.  Just being, just saying something, you go, hey, man, if I click this site, this network 
[03:38:30]  could be infected with something if I click this site.  I'm not going to click it.  That's, why would you think I would not be reasonable to understand that?  I thought I said it 45 times.  You did not say that.  You said I'm pop-ups.  In my world.  No, but then he said, I don't want my computer fucked up by clicking on it.  He did kind of say it.  I don't know.  Is there more audio?  Okay, already, at the end of the day, don't click it on.  Why'd you click it?  Because you yelled at me.  You're a big bully.  More audio.  We got audio.  Do you see what I'm saying, man? 
[03:39:00]  You bullied me into doing it.  I bullied you into doing it?  Yes.  Did you just victimize yourself, bitch?  Yeah.  You know.  You're a big bully.  That's just horrid.  That's horrid, man.  Hold on.  We got audio.  Let's hear the, we can hear what happened.  All right.  All right.  Fair enough.  It's hard one.  Yeah, I see it.  I'm not clicking it.  No.  I like my computers to work the right way.  What a fucking sissy.  What would happen if you clicked on it?  Probably nothing, but I don't really feel like being.  Probably nothing, but I don't want to.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Rewind that shit. 
[03:39:30]  What?  Rewind that little part.  No, that's going to make you look bad if you rewind it.  You don't want to rewind that part.  Is it the probably nothing part?  Yes.  Well, the probably nothing.  I'll say that he's saying that the odds are they're not always bad, but when they are,  they're a nightmare.  But if I'm paying attention to that, see, but I don't know that.  What's going to happen?  So why are you holding me responsible?  Because you don't know.  I asked.  What's going to happen?  Probably nothing.  I'm very childlike when it comes to computers.  What's going to happen?  Probably nothing.  Probably nothing.  So if nothing's probably going to happen, click. 
[03:40:00]  Am I?  Come on now.  Don't make this one of these fucking things from the 60s.  Don't make this a fucking 60s.  Why don't you stop laughing?  I don't have a German Shepherd or a Firehose.  Don't make this the OJ trial.  Don't make this the civil case.  Hey, look where we got to.  Do I make sense when I ask that?  Did that make sense in the OJ trial?  Yeah, when I heard that, the first thing I thought was, well, he did just say probably  nothing.  But then I heard Patrice get all like, but probably nothing.  When I heard that, I understood that with spyware and stuff like that, the odds are it's 
[03:40:30]  fine.  But when it's not, it's not.  It's a real problem.  Let me ask you.  Am I not saying that I'm not computer savvy to that level?  I'm actually saying that.  And I asked you in this tirade what's going to happen.  I really did.  Which was your opportunity to go.  To start explaining to you like illegal operations and kernel functions.  Oh, no, already.  But you would rather have a 45 minute argument than to explain it to me for five minutes. 
[03:41:00]  Danny, tell us about safe mode.  Yeah.  Sometimes it's a driver thing.  I don't know how to get the safe mode.  Don't know.  No.  You get the safe mode by not clicking on malicious websites and links.  That's how computers be in safe mode.  I mean, sarcasm is going to fix this all.  It's going to fix your inside, Danny.  Oh, wow.  But I'm saying, what I'm saying is, let's say.  I'm saying sarcasm is.  Let's say, let's say.  Thank you.  I have a 25% chance of getting my computer infected.  That's a pretty big chance of infection, right?  But is it still probably nothing? 
[03:41:30]  Is it 75% still probably nothing?  Danny, we're going in circles.  I said.  You're going in circles.  I don't know.  I just don't want to click on a fucking, on a bad website.  But you still did in the midst of all of that.  And I asked you.  So what you're saying is.  Because you're yelling at me.  And I said, well, I like Patrice.  He's a nice guy.  I'll do this for him because you're not a nice guy.  You destroyed a computer for me?  Yes.  That's what you said to yourself?  Yes.  Let me put it on me.  Go.  Let's hear more, Derek.  Let's hear more.  Yeah, put it on me.  Should we hear a little more?  Yeah, yeah.  I just wanted to hear the part where I said what's going to happen.  He said probably not.  But hold on.  There might be a further explanation after that.  Okay, just a little. 
[03:42:00]  No, can we start with that?  Just a little more.  Can we start with that, though?  Yeah.  I like my computers to work the right way.  What a fucking sissy.  What would happen if you clicked on it?  Probably nothing, but I don't really feel like being.  Probably nothing, but I don't want to.  Fucking homo.  And you asked that.  Do you want to go to your house?  I do, stupid.  No infection on your computer.  That's why I've been trying to help you.  No infection.  No infection.  Stop being horrified.  So I should just watch illegal movies on my computer, and that'll make my life better.  And it wasn't.  Thank you.  Stop it right there. 
[03:42:30]  And here's the whole thing.  Okay, counselor.  It was not about the fucking, the malware.  It was about the illegalness.  Something as illegal as blackmail.  Yes, it was the fear of illegal.  So actually, it was the, it was, it was you not wanting to get involved in something.  Do you just want to say that you just want to win, and we can take a break, and just  do commercials and stuff?  This is what I like.  All right.  All right.  I like, I like, oh, I'm so done with this, because he feels.  Because what's happening?  Because one argument gets blown away, you fucking totally lost the argument, and now you 
[03:43:00]  have to find something else to fucking come back from.  You have to fucking argue again.  You know what kicked that, you know what really started that argument?  When you said, do it at home on your computer, and somebody went, ooh, ooh.  And you made him defensive, and that was it.  I was fucking, ooh.  Jimmy's taunting.  Did you hear the ooh?  Yeah.  Jimmy was taunting both of them.  Can you go back a little bit?  I must have oohed 30 times.  Jimmy's job is just to taunt until fucking combustion happens. 
[03:43:30]  And you really, and Anthony, you really, truly, were protecting your little fucking buddy  that sleeps at your house.  I felt you.  No, no, no.  Don't fucking just divide a cock of bullshit.  Don't just divide it.  Can we play that new part again?  I was just saying, I completely understand malware, so to me, and the viability of sites  that host this kind of content.  Yes.  That's the fucking thing.  Let's hear that again, because I forgot that I oohed a whole bunch of times.  Let's hear it for Jimmy's ooh. 
[03:44:00]  Which is the equivalent of the spider scene in Goodfellas.  That's how fucking button pushing it is.  Oh, you're going to take this?  I did a bunch of them.  I forgot.  Yeah, let's hear.  Fucking homo.  The rapture.  Do it and do it at your house.  I do, stupid.  I do it at my house.  That's so fucking argument.  Wait, let it play for a couple seconds, because I think there's more of those.  And I would never call Danny a homo.  The rapture.  Do it and do it at your house.  I do, stupid. 
[03:44:30]  I do it at my house.  Nothing's wrong.  Yeah.  No infection on your computer.  That's why I've been trying to help you.  Stop living a scared life.  Stop being horrified.  So I should just watch illegal movies on my computer, and that'll make my life better?  There's not a fucking ball out there that said, yeah, you go, Danny.  You embarrassment.  Patrice, I don't want to fuck up the computer.  It works.  Don't make your voice higher like you're making a stand.  Just be there.  Just be mad, I didn't call you back.  Ooh. 
[03:45:00]  Oh, my God.  This is Dave.  So, wait, wait.  I'm keeping notes here, by the way.  Ooh.  Ooh.  Listen to me.  All I wanted to do was to not go to a malicious website, and I've been called by Patrice,  a homo, a scared little boy.  He's tried some kind of division.  Yes.  You called me in embarrassment, and you imply that I immediately threw up a defense mechanism.  Yes.  All I wanted to do was have a computer to continue functioning the way it was working.  Why didn't you do that?  You tell me again.  Why?  You know what? 
[03:45:30]  I'm going to stop talking.  Because listen to you.  Because once you tell me, Patrice, you rule my mind, and I did it because you just got  to me, I'll just shut up.  All right.  Sounds reasonable.  I just wanted to make the sound stop happening.  Patrice sounds like a reasonable man.  I fucking around.  I don't like that.  Danny.  I love you, Danny.  I'd rather.  I wouldn't have called you all those things if I didn't love you.  I'd rather kill the fighting about whether or not we're going to click on it.  To me, it was more important. 
[03:46:00]  It was just like, you know what?  I don't care.  Whatever.  If he just wants me to click it, I'll click it.  Fine.  Forget it.  Do you?  That's the reason why?  That's the right thing?  Look, I think both of you are getting your fucking...  What, Joe?  Oh, God, Joe.  Joe.  He's losing his mind over the stupidest thing.  Take your hips and your chest out of your pocket.  I think he was trying to stand his fucking ground for XM, and he didn't want to do something 
[03:46:30]  that was going to fuck up his job and get him in trouble.  That was for XM?  No.  And I think...  Listen.  That was for my computer.  I use this every day.  For the computer.  I'm saying...  I need it to work.  I need it to work.  Patrice, I have my personal email open on this computer all the time.  Yeah, that's supposed to go.  You know?  Well, I use it for...  Look, it's my brother.  Ooh.  So, I gotta say...  All right, Danny.  All right.  So, maybe you understand why I don't want to click through to your fucking no-name...  I understand it now.  ...dot fucking TV website.  I understand it now.  Okay, look.  You two fucking lunatics. 
[03:47:00]  Jesus.  You're both insane.  No, I'm not.  He's insane.  It's just like, I'm not going to let him fucking talk all this insanity to me like this.  I'm insane?  Of course.  It's just me that's insane?  No, no.  You're both fucking crazy on this issue.  I'll take that.  As long as there's full credit for everyone.  You guys can...  Like, I would fucking be exhausted if I battled it out with somebody over something so inane  as this for so long.  That's why I can't let him win this, because it's so fucking dumb.  Yeah, it's so insane.  I'm not losing.  You're fucking invested.  I didn't know we were fighting.  I'm not losing.  I didn't want to click on a pop-up argument. 
[03:47:30]  The only winning move is not to play.  Yes.  And I wasn't playing.  I just was talking.  Now, all of a sudden, Danny wants to beat me at something.  Do you understand?  Oh, stop.  What do you see?  White tricks.  Just drop.  You got to drop.  White tricks.  All right, here's what we're going to do.  We are going to take a fucking break.  Ooh.  Then when we come back, I want to get into a real discussion about Patrice wanting another  girlfriend.  Why?  Because that's a good discussion.  All right.  That's not crazy.  Old crazy.  No, no.  That's good shit. 
[03:48:00]  Old nutty negro.  No.  There he goes again.  No.  I don't understand why you take whiteness, and you're a fucking Egyptian.  You sure are.  That's what bugs me about you.  I'm only half Arab.  Oh, shit.  I didn't know that.  You take white feelings, and you're a goddamn Egyptian.  That's what bugs me about you.  You sure are.  I'm white.  I'm half Arab.  I'm half Arab, but you go on skin.  What's the other half?  Mohammed Atta was white.  Who the fuck is that?  Exactly.  Exactly.  How do you not know?  He's fucking flying into a building, you fucking dick. 
[03:48:30]  Yeah, you want to be a surgeon in Egypt, don't you?  We all know who the fucking al-Qaeda number two is.  Ozil-Ohari.  Don't act like you don't know.  He is pretty white, though, for an Arab.  He is an Arab.  Sure he is.  He comes here and he's similar.  Al-Bino?  You look filthy, too.  You look Arab.  Yeah, I know.  Anthony looks really Arab.  You look really Arab.  Half Arab, half dove.  Anthony's an eggplant.  You're a dirty terrorist.  What are you, Egyptian and what?  Italian.  There's nothing white about it.  You're black.  You're hairy. 
[03:49:00]  There's nothing white about it.  There's nothing white about it.  Danny, and you're always taking white.  Fucking Danny's got to start shit all the time, calling him fucking hairy.  You're more attached to my point of view.  Why do I always got to bring race into this?  I'm not white, and let this be known for the fucking record and how you operate, okay?  What?  This is how you operate.  I'm not white until you want to call me during John McCain giving a speech and go,  you know something?  Y'all crackers ain't shit.  And you want me to take the fucking weight of the white race.  Because no one, I was going in order of white to the next piece. 
[03:49:30]  I would end up calling one of my light-skinned black friends if none of my white friends answered.  Yeah.  And whenever I've talked to you about...  There is one of those things going on between light-skinned black people and darkest kids.  That McCain speech was fantastic.  Why?  He was very gracious.  We've had long...  Holy shit.  We've had long conversations.  What is going on?  This is starting to make me feel like I'm not a nice guy.  You're not a nice guy.  It's terrible.  You're not a nice guy.  You're having a midlife meltdown. 
[03:50:00]  The things I've seen you do in a 22-year-old woman's minds.  Oh, man.  It's not true.  Ladies and gentlemen, Patrice O'Neill is hosting The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Hosted by Patrice O'Neill.  Hey, what's up?  This is Patrice O'Neill hosting The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  And check out this bit.  It's, of course, Louis C.K. trying to say that some shit ain't right or some shit ain't right.  That nigga think he know everything.  It's the Illuminati bit with me and Louis C.K. 
[03:50:30]  And he's trying to make the Illuminati a figment of my Negro imagination when we all know they exist, bitch.  Look at the fucking pyramids on the dollar.  That don't tell you nothing?  You don't see the eye?  You don't see the owl?  White people, get your shit together, man.  You got to believe in something, you know?  Damn.  All right.  Enjoy this.  Broadcasting The Worst of Opie and Anthony with your host, Patrice O'Neill.  I don't remember there being a lot of crime in Manhattan.  You don't remember?  Well, you don't remember. 
[03:51:00]  I don't either.  But I hear tell.  In the 70s, it was bad.  Yeah, the 70s was awful.  That's why they made that movie, The Warriors.  Yeah, yeah.  And they think that Central Park was just crazy.  We got a guy that used to work around that time.  Billy, thumbs up on that bed?  Hold on.  Let me get you out of here.  Billy, man.  But in the 70s, you know, there was serious crime and there was a lot of lawlessness going  around and, you know, you really weren't, your hands were kind of tied.  Billy, can I please ask you a question?  Let's stop this fiasco.  Just tell us how you flooded the black community with crack. 
[03:51:30]  Which is interesting.  Patrice called Billy Mac his worst nightmare earlier.  We gave it away with the grape soda.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, no, we didn't.  But that is, I will say, that is the dismissive paranoia that you people do to us, which is  we know that you put sterilizations, sterilizing agents in the great punch, in the great punch. 
[03:52:00]  Think of what would happen if we didn't.  Mr. Billy, thank you for being honest.  You put that, we all know you invented AIDS.  Yeah.  Sure.  I'll fess up to that.  Thank you very much.  Yeah, I know that.  The Illuminati.  The Illuminati.  And you said, looks, the head of the Illuminati, Patrice said he looks like the Quaker Oats guy.  It's just this vast white conspiracy that's based on symbols and stuff, you know, like the Masons and the Pyramid and the eyeball on the back of the dollars and the pentagram and pentagon. 
[03:52:30]  I don't want to believe it.  I don't want to believe it, but you, look, there's a YouTube thing called, just look at the symbols.  You look at the dollar.  Let's take the fucking dollar and the fact that after 9-11, you can fold it up and you can see the Twin Towers burning.  Now.  Right.  Why?  I could also fold up Washington's head and make it look like a mushroom.  But wait a minute.  What the fuck does that mean?  The fuck. 
[03:53:00]  Mushroom's good.  When you fold up a dollar, does it look like the world tracing a burning?  Because you're crazy and you have problems in your brain.  Because your brain doesn't work properly.  And then who the fuck do things?  Because you're putting all your energy in the wrong places.  It's not right.  Which is what black people do.  This is what bothers me about some of you.  The Illuminati.  Come on, man.  The Illuminati.  That takes too much work to get the dollar bill just right.  What's the thing?  If we're going to rig 9-11, why would we make a rig? 
[03:53:30]  You have to use that language.  Oh, rig.  Why would we go all the way back to the dollar design and go...  That's a lot of...  We've got to have got this dollar definition.  Okay, listen.  That's a lot of patience, too.  Why the fuck?  And why wouldn't they have done it a lot earlier?  Because it's like, look, we've got the dollar bill set.  Let's do this immediately.  Why is it?  I knew it.  Copious on the fucking dollar bill.  Wow.  Now I've got to pull out a buck.  A black guy trying to read Latin is about as sad as any other.  Get your dollar bill out, you fucking spits. 
[03:54:00]  Shit, I only got hundreds.  Damn.  And no surprise, I have no money.  So I'm kidding.  I hope he's got nothing.  All right, let me see.  Oh, here's a dollar.  Just what the fuck is this shit on it?  Where is the tower's on fire thing?  Come on.  How do you do the tower's on fire thing?  It's some kind of...  I don't know how to do it.  Damn it.  It's like origami you've got to do.  You've got the mushroom?  It's a mad fold-in.  It's the front.  It's a mad fold-in.  Oh, yeah, you do this.  Is it the front?  It's the front.  Oh, right, because his hair is smoke.  And then the...  No, no, no.  The frame around it.  It's trees.  Trees.  The frame around his head looks like a tower if you fold it right. 
[03:54:30]  No, it's not.  I think his head is the smoke.  Oh, fuck, man.  You forgot how to do it.  You don't know how to do it.  Google.  Shit.  Oh, there it is.  Look, look, look.  Right there.  Oh, yeah, you've got to fold it in a triangle.  Cut the fuck off, man.  Shit, I'm going to get arthritis trying to...  First of all, it's a 20.  Oh, it's a 20.  Yeah, you idiot.  Shit, Patrice, go knock one of them over the head and grab one.  Oh, it's a 20.  Dude, look at that shit.  That's nothing?  That's just complicated. 
[03:55:00]  That's nothing to you?  That's somebody figuring out a fucking...  But why would we do that?  Because would we do that?  What's to be gained?  Because, like, the honorable...  The fucking back of a 20 was designed, like, a million years ago.  Exactly.  Why do that, Patrice?  Just to go, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.  Like the honorable Reverend Wright said.  You think we designed the 20 to make that picture, and then, like, a hundred years later,  somebody designed the Twin Tower to match it.  There it is.  It's burning.  Look at that. 
[03:55:30]  There it is.  You just fucking take a look at that.  Two towers, one's taller than the other.  It's on fire.  That is fucking...  What kind of coincidence is that?  Let me see.  Let me see.  What the fuck?  What kind of coincidence is that?  Let me see.  I can't see.  No, I'm not going to hand it to you.  That's just a nothing?  I know you'll take it.  Get out of here, you bastard.  That's just nothing?  That's nothing.  I need a cab money.  Anthony, that's nothing.  No, it's...  Let me look.  It's a coincidence.  It's, um...  The world is...  I'm trying to think of how someone might have come up with it.  Yeah, exactly.  But you're right.  Why?  That is quite the coincidence.  Why? 
[03:56:00]  Like, who said, hey, you know, if you're folded...  Why, then why right after 9-11 did that happen?  Why do I know how to do that right after 9-11?  Dude, if someone did it before, now that would be fucked up.  If somebody did it before, then that'll be better.  At least you go, oh...  Better?  Look at the towers burning.  Dude.  Oh, and then it happens, and then you'd be like, who was that fucking guy?  They did this years before 9-11, and people went, ah, it looks like nothing.  Oh, well.  And then one day, people were like, holy shit.  It looks like the towers burning.  Listen, man.  I'm going to try to invent something.  I'm just going to take a 10.  I'm going to try to fold it up and show black people rioting. 
[03:56:30]  Louie, Louie, Louie, I am begging to half of you.  Please.  Half of you.  I'm going to...  Just, I'm begging to you.  Patrice.  Shh.  All right.  See, you've got to give white people more credit than that.  Okay, look.  I want to show you the back of a 10 folded the same way.  It's the towers again.  No.  If you fold any fucking bill like this, the towers are going to be burning.  Okay, then that even makes it more scary.  I'm making a hairy pussy out of my dollar.  Just give me a few minutes here. 
[03:57:00]  Hairy pussy.  I'm going with 70s Earth Mama Muff.  What happens to 100?  If you look at a 20, just look at a 20 for a second.  The front of it just unfolded.  And look at Andrew Jackson and the collar of his jacket.  Oh, shit.  It looks like a woman's black legs, and he's like diving into...  And she's got a little white painting.  Look at it.  Do you see it?  Oh, yeah, I see it.  They do like knees up in the air, and he's about to dip down and see the little white  panties right above where Jackson's...  You ever do the thing with the butter, the girl with the butter? 
[03:57:30]  He's eating a black woman's pussy.  The little Indian girl that's on her knees with the butter?  No, you make tits.  I mean tits.  Tits, right.  Like she's holding the butter like this, but her kneecaps, because she's kneeling,  you could fold her kneecaps up to her chest.  Yeah, why would they do that?  That was almost jerk-off material.  No, it's dismissive.  This is dismissive.  I can't allow this.  You can't marginalize the Illuminati, man.  It's there.  There's no reason.  Where's the owl?  Let's fold 100 the same way and see what happens.  Huh?  Where's the owl, and what does that mean?  Where's the owl?  YouTube.  YouTube.  What dollar bill is the owl on?  On the one? 
[03:58:00]  I gotta find out if I'm looking at this.  There's supposedly a small owl.  Yeah, he's something with the Illuminati about the owl.  A small owl somewhere.  Where?  I see the eye above the pyramid.  All right, you fold 100, you get nothing.  Huh?  You get like a fucking bad shave job on a pussy.  It looks like...  Dude, where's the owl?  Come on.  Come on.  Where is the owl?  Yeah, what's this with the owl?  Why does the owl mean so much to the Illuminati?  It's all evil shit, man.  Where's the owl?  Since when's the owl evil?  No, it's on there.  That little blob is an owl?  Oh, shit. 
[03:58:30]  Thank you.  Thank you, Mars.  Of course, Mars, we know.  What's the matter?  Of course, because he's down, but he wants to keep his job.  It's a minor.  Come on, Mars.  What is it, Mars?  You know about the Illuminati, don't you?  Sit down, man.  Fuck that shit.  All right, what's the Illuminati, Mars?  Help us out.  Don't get nervous, man.  Fuck that.  I'll give you a job fixing my computer.  No, actually...  I want to see a little crack happen in this window, and Mars just collapse in his seat as blood comes  from his head.  Why?  Why is that?  Why?  That's the devil pentagram, man.  So what does that mean? 
[03:59:00]  That's fucking devil worship and fucking pagan shit.  The star has been a part of this country for many years, part of the flag, obviously,  a part of a lot of symbols.  A part of devil worship.  More devil worship.  He's saying the pentagram is just huge.  Look at the pentagram.  But...  Pentagram.  Pentagon.  Motherfuckers.  Yeah, the number five is a little hard to avoid.  It's right between four and six.  It's a fucking...  Okay, here's the pyramid.  Well, look at this shit.  It's all symbols of the Illuminati.  Eyeball.  On our fucking dollar bill. 
[03:59:30]  Why?  Yes, because these are all shapes that are very useful in architecture.  You believe in the Illuminati, right?  You believe it, right?  These are all...  Mars...  Wait a minute.  ...there's a reason why we keep people using pyramids.  Mars believes it.  Mars believes it, too.  What is the Illuminati?  What are they?  It's the silent bunch of white guys, like masons and shit like that.  They're not silent.  They're ruling everything openly.  Yeah, but they're ruling...  And hurting black people for profit.  Every day.  Why are you looking for secrets?  There's no secret.  It's right out there.  Just like people are kicking your ass with no...  Nicholas Cage's movie.  They made it to make fun of it. 
[04:00:00]  Disney fun out of it.  Right.  But it's real shit.  It's so...  It's evil shit.  Again, it's black people putting effort in the wrong area.  Look at...  Lucas is one.  I'm trying to uncover that.  You think...  You think that the Founding Fathers set something up that has continued all throughout these  years and gotten stronger?  It's not secret.  It's not secret.  It's not secret.  It's not secret.  And it's based on white people staying in power?  They fucking...  Absolutely.  And they fucking...  They have...  You know...  Can I ask you something, though, here?  Please.  What do they say when they kill white girls? 
[04:00:30]  Virgin white girls?  Jesus Christ.  Fun?  Fun.  All the way for somebody to...  I hope no one catches me.  How come the Founding Fathers...  This was before the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation, so there was still slavery.  Black people weren't even...  It didn't even look like they were going to be in charge of anything or even come close  to being in charge.  So why would the Founding Fathers put in place something to keep the black man down when  they were already...  I don't think it's made to keep the black man down because it makes everyone suffer. 
[04:01:00]  It's not just a black thing.  It's the master plan to make white people say certain things.  It's the quiet war.  That's what the pyramids are.  It's the masses.  It's the eyeball is over the masses.  The pinnacle.  To hide from everything, man.  Why are you folding $20 bills when...  I didn't fold $20 bills.  The Bush and the Bin Laden family are business partners, and they fucking brought down the towers  like right in front of everybody, and then we...  I mean, there's no secret. 
[04:01:30]  Are you trying to...  It's so silly.  Is this some kind of magic sarcasm?  I believe it, motherfucker.  You don't even need sarcasm because I believe it.  It's like somebody walks up and punches you in the face, and then you go fold the dollar  and go, I think this guy's trying to get me with this dollar.  There's no white people here.  Not one motherfucker that believes that the towers might have been brought down on some old  creepy shit.  Not just Arabs.  Not one.  Not a one.  Not one.  Look at that.  That's how you know it's the Illuminati. 
[04:02:00]  I believe it.  I believe it, but it's got nothing to do with the Illuminati.  Look at this shit here.  Look at this one.  The devil sign.  Look at the devil sign, and look at this shit.  Look at it.  What the fuck?  That's Barbara Bush.  Why?  Why?  Why?  They're all doing the devil sign.  Why?  The rock and roll devil sign.  Why?  Hello, sir.  Hello.  How are you, devil?  Hello.  Good to see you, devil worshiper.  There's a montage of various politicians, and they're doing that rock and roll devil horn 
[04:02:30]  with their finger and pinky.  How many now?  Come on, man.  Oh, shit.  Oh, back to CNN.  Oh, shit.  Look at the owl.  Back to CNN.  Oh, my God, yo.  Fuck the owl.  Back to CNN.  The front of the courthouse.  There you go.  That's what you do to black people.  Oh, fuck your owl.  Look at this.  Your black people are up to something a little more interesting than the Illuminati right now.  The front of the courthouse is starting to look like someone dropped a cricket in front of the ant hole.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  The Illuminati. 
[04:03:00]  All right.  Back to the Illuminati.  Yeah.  What's with the devil horns, though?  The devil horns.  What is that?  It's the devil.  Devil worshipping.  But fucking, like, Dio invented that.  What is he in charge of?  Why did it stop?  The soundtrack?  The Illuminati?  No, no, no.  Because they're going to get to the money that the owl is.  Listen how crazy he's going.  Why did you stop?  All right.  I'm going again.  All right.  Here we go.  Now, we got a building.  There's a lot of pyramids.  Okay.  Now, look at the doll.  What's in the corner?  Is that an owl?  Wait.  What the fuck?  Was that an owl in the doll?  It's a slow dissolve to a goat devil.  All right.  Show me the owl.  I'll start with you.  Holy shit. 
[04:03:30]  Oh, my God.  We got an owl.  Where's the owl?  Why is there a baby owl on the dollar bill?  Maybe to keep people from fucking counterfeiting it.  Oh, a fucking baby.  To make a detail.  What do you want?  An X on a piece of paper?  Here, it's 100.  No, that's.  Take my word for it.  That's called, uh, that's that bullshit they do on it.  The lines and shit.  The etching.  Whatever.  All right.  What's up with the owl there, Rob? </pre>
