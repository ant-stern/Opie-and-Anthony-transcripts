<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show broadcast opened with a raucous discussion of the Lance Armstrong Oprah interview and the Manti Te’o hoax, peppered with copious vulgar and offensive language.  The hosts, along with frequent guest Jim Norton, dissected Armstrong’s confession, focusing on his years of denial, the pervasive doping culture in cycling, and the hypocrisy of those previously silent on the issue. They played clips of Armstrong’s past denials, highlighting the interview’s awkwardness and Armstrong’s perceived lack of remorse.  The conversation extended to the complicity of cycling's governing bodies.

The Manti Te’o hoax dominated a significant portion of the show.  The hosts, initially uninformed, speculated wildly, using homophobic slurs, about Te’o’s sexuality and suggesting he fabricated the online girlfriend story to conceal his being gay.  They created a (quickly corrected) “fact checklist” summarizing their speculation, noting its viral potential.  They heavily criticized the media's lazy reporting.  A humorous call to Mike Francesa featured a caller jokingly asking if Te’o was the "greatest homosexual linebacker of all time."  A deep dive into a CNN interview with John Coblin of Deadspin followed, with the hosts mocking Coblin’s increasingly nervous demeanor and verbal stumbles as he discussed the hoax. They found amusement in Coblin’s discomfort and highlighted inconsistencies in Te’o’s statements, emphasizing evidence suggesting his connection to the hoax’s perpetrator, Ronaia Tuiasasopo.  The hosts discussed Deadspin's reporting, revealing a high school classmate's involvement and the actual identity of the woman whose photo was used to portray the fake girlfriend.

A "F.U. Line" segment featured vulgar and angry caller messages.  Upcoming guests Josh Gad and Dominic Monaghan were announced, along with an audio recording of a stuttering American Idol contestant.  The hosts shared anecdotes about past interns, often using derogatory language to describe their often-exaggerated stories.  The discussion returned to the Te’o situation, detailing further uncovered facts, and compared it to a similar situation involving a staff member, "Bobo," and his apparently nonexistent online girlfriend. The athletic director’s statements and speculation about Te’o’s future were also discussed.

A substantial segment focused on Jim Norton’s online relationship with a woman named Kitty, residing overseas,  detailed in explicit sexual terms and communicated primarily through Twitter. The hosts questioned the relationship’s authenticity due to the lack of phone calls or in-person interaction, encouraging Bobo, a caller, to be more assertive and sexually explicit in his own online communication.  The introduction of the new intern, initially called Sydney (later renamed "Luca" by the hosts) who arrived with a black eye and a questionable story about being injured at work, was followed by a phone call from what appeared to be Luca’s boyfriend.  A discussion on New York gun legislation ensued, spurred by Jim Norton's recent gun purchase and commentary on Michael Bloomberg's gun control stance.

Dominic Monaghan joined the show, discussing his experiences filming *The Lord of the Rings* and *The Hobbit*,  including makeup, filming processes, and his current show, *Wild Things*. He shared anecdotes about Peter Jackson's fear of spiders and his experiences with bribery in Venezuela.  Josh Gad then joined, discussing his experiences in *The Book of Mormon*, meeting President Obama, his role in *1600 Penn*, and his upcoming role in the Steve Jobs biopic.  The conversation included humorous anecdotes and off-color comments, including a discussion about wearing "cock socks" during nude scenes.  A recurring "line of the day" segment featured several crude and sexually explicit entries.  The show then briefly covered Opie's upcoming Vegas and San Diego appearances with Josh Gad, concluding with thank yous to listeners and promotional information about Sirius XM On Demand.  A later segment focused on Dominic Monaghan's time on *Lost*,  his character's death scene, frustrations with the storyline, and his decision not to rewatch the episodes. He also discussed the show's ambiguous ending, comparing it to *The Sopranos* and *Six Feet Under*.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  All aboard! All aboard for the Opie and Anthony show!  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  It's gonna melt your mind.  So vulgar.  Shut up, you fucking degenerate hippie cocksucker!  I would take a shot in the face for a minute.  Very small cock.  So flasherent. 
[00:00:30]  I've farted three times since I've been here.  I'm like, alright, the Opie and Anthony show.  Here we are.  Another four hours of love.  The jokes all end up talking like cock and ball.  This is good practice when I do The View.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  This probably is the greatest that ever existed.  You guys having a good time or what?  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:01:00]  And convention burns the ground.  Don't do it, I can't take it every time I'm on the show.  She's cock!  With Opie the destroyer.  You're a bigger douchebag.  You're a big douchebag.  That's what I do now.  Anthony, the rage.  Yeah, yeah, your guy had a corner on the peanut.  We understand.  I'll give it to your guy on the peanut.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  This is why I can't even take fingers in my ass, because it makes me feel like I have to shit.  All kidding aside, dicks have to feel wonderful.  But I just can't take them. 
[00:01:30]  The Opie and Anthony show.  Strap in.  Strap the fuck in.  This one's gonna hurt.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Forever, you know?  And now it's just falling apart.  Good morning, everyone.  Hi.  Look at that.  Before you know it, boom.  Friday.  Okay, I don't know how that happened.  Quickly, we were talking about American Idol and how much of a bust it is this year.  I'm not really watching.  I saw the stutterer last night, because I guess a lot of people will be talking about him today. 
[00:02:00]  But Mariah Carey, who went to my high school, by the way.  Yeah, yeah, it's hard to feel.  And knew my brothers.  Oh.  She is so not relatable.  Yeah, she's kind of out of touch.  She's out of touch.  She hasn't lived like a normal human being since she was 20 years old, probably.  There was a stutterer on last night that we'll get into.  And she goes, what's up with the talking thing?  Is it something you're working on? 
[00:02:30]  She had no clue that people stutter.  I don't know.  What do you mean, what's up with the talking thing?  We all know what a stutterer is.  Apparently not.  Apparently not Mariah Carey.  And it's not an easy thing to just work on.  Yeah.  That's your buddy's wife, right there?  Nick Cannon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Nick Cannon.  Yeah.  And then Mickey, Mickey, Nicki Minaj.  The Nicki Minaj.  That broad.  Yeah.  She's horrible, too. 
[00:03:00]  She's awful.  This show's terrible.  And then Keith Urban.  Has nothing.  Does he have a little in him?  A little bit?  Oh.  He's either Australian or a queeb.  Or a queeb.  Or a quee.  Or a quee.  Could be a quee.  A queeb or a quee.  He's got the gay voice.  The gay voice.  He's got the gay voice.  The gay face.  And the gay face.  No, we don't know, man.  His voice is a little effeminate.  Even more than Sam's, if I might say.  My voice isn't gay.  What?  I had to listen to that. 
[00:03:30]  You didn't hear that, did you?  Oh, my God.  It's not gay.  I said that?  You did.  I'm a little gay.  I don't say anything like a queeb.  Or a quee.  Or a quee.  Like the loafers or a moe.  I think, I don't know.  I think the Oprah went for a interview.  And I love the Eric Logan.  He works for the Oprah.  Yes.  I was bored shitless by the interview.  It was more like an interrogation.  Was it?  Yeah, than an interview.  I don't feel that they had a good rapport with each other.  No.  I think Lance was thinking, this is what I got to do.  Yeah, yeah.  That's like, here's my answers. 
[00:04:00]  Yes.  No.  No.  Yes.  And a lot of people wonder why Lance is doing this.  He wants to compete as a triathlete.  Yes.  So he needs to be kind of cleared, because the guy that's holding him back also runs  the triathlons.  He's not allowed to ride his bicycle.  Oh, no.  They took his bike.  Oh, no.  I remember if I got in trouble as a kid, I couldn't ride my bicycle.  He's in trouble and can't ride his bike.  His little bicycle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I watched about a half hour to 40 minutes, and I was really just bored. 
[00:04:30]  There was something about it.  It was just, it wasn't an easy watch.  No.  I've seen some Oprah interviews that were, you know, pretty compelling and stuff.  Right.  She kind of gets a kind of chemistry with the person, a rapport.  This, there was nothing between those two.  And obviously, Lance wants to, you know, he wants to name names badly.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And he kept saying, you know, she was asking questions, and he was like, well, it's hard  to answer that, because I want to name names.  I mean, I don't want to name names. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  He basically was saying, I don't want to do that.  But, you know, damn well he wants to do that.  Oh, when you take the fall, you want to take a few people with you.  Yeah, but he doesn't want to hurt his cause, and I think naming all sorts of names is going  to hurt his cause even more.  Yeah.  He's in a bad spot, of course, but it could be even worse.  Yeah, making more enemies is not something he should be doing right now, so.  But Jose Canseco did.  Yeah.  Named names, then he looked like a fucking dick.  He looked like a rat.  I know I look like a fucking dick, because it's, in Jose Canseco's world, everyone knew 
[00:05:30]  what the fuck was going on.  Right.  Everyone knew.  Just like in this Lance Armstrong story, everyone knew that this sport was riddled with people  that were doping.  Just about all of them.  Just about all of them.  Yeah.  And he was the best after being doped.  After having that doping done to him, he was the best.  So fucking, let him be the best for that era.  It brought everyone up to a certain level.  And then he was the best.  But then they all had to be the best at that level.  So yeah, he was the best at that level. 
[00:06:00]  You know, it's a bunch of horse shit, because the sport itself knows that this was going  down.  You can't have that many people doping and not know if you're in charge of the sport.  It's impossible.  Yeah.  Just like with the steroids and all those guys not getting in the Hall of Fame, the sports  riders are a bunch of cunts.  They fucking were right there.  They were twats, because now they're like, oh, I'm not voting for this fucking guy.  But you knew.  If it's your job every day to go to the stadium and write about baseball, you know what's 
[00:06:30]  going on in front of you.  You're not stupid.  They were in the locker rooms.  You don't think they fucking heard the players talking and joking about it and shit like that?  They saw Barry Bonds' head getting bigger in front of their eyes.  They knew.  But they chose at the time to like, oh, we all kind of know, but we're all obviously on  the same page here.  No one's really going to talk about it.  And then when it comes out and some people get in trouble, they're holier than thou.  Right.  Well, for our industry, oh, it's terrible.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  We can't vote for these guys.  Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah, hurrah.  Bunch of hypocrites. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  And the same thing with this Lance Armstrong.  I mean, wow, man.  That's a sport that, you know, it was common knowledge.  I don't know when it started to become common knowledge.  Yeah.  But, you know, I don't know if it, the Greg LeMond era, because I remember him.  He's the only other cyclist I could name by name.  I couldn't name a one.  You don't remember Greg LeMond?  No.  He was just before, he was the big dog before Lance Armstrong, I think.  But Lance Armstrong brought a name to the Tour de France that no one else had, you know? 
[00:07:30]  And I think they knew that, you know?  When they get a bunch of people involved and it just translates into money.  Right.  So they probably just left it alone.  Right.  But then again, when it comes out, everyone steps away.  Yeah.  But they, I mean, they had a system in place.  Something amazing.  What do they say?  They had hidden refrigerators.  They had flights where they would fly the whole team to Spain.  They would get all doped up in Spain and then they would come back. 
[00:08:00]  They had a system of how to get rid of the shit.  They would put it in soda cans and crush the soda can and then give it to like a team doctor to dispose of.  And they were all, except for maybe, maybe a handful, they were all doing it.  Who were at the back of the fucking pack.  Right, right.  Who was that warrant doping.  Well, those are the guys that probably were thinking, look, you know, I'm not going to fuck up my body.  Yeah.  Because I know if I dope, it's not going to be enough for me to actually win or place or whatever.  So I'm not going to fucking take that chance. 
[00:08:30]  I'll just wait until these guys get busted and then I'll win.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Get them all out of the sport.  It's just sad because everything you think you know is just bullshit in the end.  You like to think that this Lance Armstrong was that much better than everyone.  But I think he was if they were all doping.  I think so, too.  If they were all doping, then he is that much better.  But he was saying, he was asked by Oprah, I guess, if he thought he could have won without it.  Yeah.  And he said no.  Yeah.  But they all knew that. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  You know, because it's one of those cases where it's like, look, you first.  Yeah.  You stop doing it first.  Yeah, let's see how that works out.  You stop doing it and then I'll stop doing it.  Yeah, yeah.  And then apparently the method they had for covering it up had to have been amazing, too.  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.  Because they drug test these motherfuckers.  Yeah.  And nothing showed up.  I don't know.  Yeah.  Or was that a scandal?  Yeah.  I'm not going to speak out of turn, as they say.  Oh, tell and tell's out of school.  I don't know all the ins and outs.  But yeah, it seems a little strange to me, certainly. 
[00:09:30]  But this is how the Oprah interview went down in the beginning.  You may now express the love that you have for one.  The CDs might be mixed up.  Which one is this now?  That's probably the Bubba CD.  Bubba!  Bubba!  Just switch that out.  Ray Dudley?  Ray getting married?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, you're right.  It's not Bubba Ray Dudley.  You are right.  I mean, Bully Ray.  Bully Ray.  Oh, that guy.  See, I thought you meant the other guy. 
[00:10:00]  No.  Bubba Ray Dudley.  That guy doesn't exist.  So he got married to Brooke Hogan last night?  Oh, God.  Where are they going on their honeymoon?  Anywhere cool?  It didn't go down.  What?  Sad story.  We should probably get into it later.  Oh, no.  But he insisted it was real and all.  No, it wasn't his fault that it didn't go down.  Can I ask you a question?  Yeah, sure.  Was there a part where he said, if there's anyone who feels that this marriage should not  take place, speak now.  Listen.  Oh, my God.  They didn't go with that angle, did they?  No, no.  Come on.  And then someone's music started.  Did they? 
[00:10:30]  Look, we don't even have to watch anymore.  Did they go with that angle?  Is that how it went down?  I don't think he expected his best man, Taz, to betray him.  Well, we love the Taz.  Go back with the Taz.  He's a bad guy, and he betrayed Bully Ray.  Wow.  Well, now we got a problem, because they're both friends of ours.  And they're not friends with each other.  So who do we go with, Team Taz or Team Bubba Ray Dudley?  Oh, my God.  The best man.  I mean, I got to go with Bubba, because what Taz did was just so out of line.  Well, you know what?  Did someone say, turn the plates over, and they turned it over, and the best man was 
[00:11:00]  having sex with the bride?  Because that was happening at a wedding I was at.  Taz was fucking broke.  Yes, it was terrible.  Very embarrassing.  It was horrible.  Yeah, it was awful.  Well, here's how Oprah started the Lance Armstrong interview.  All for all.  With a whole bunch of yes and no questions.  This whole conversation, we have a lot of time, will be about the details.  Yes or no, did you ever take banned substances to enhance your cycling performance?  Yes. 
[00:11:30]  Yes or no, was one of those banned substances EPO?  Yes.  Did you ever use any other banned substances like testosterone, cortisone, or human growth  hormone?  Yes.  Wow.  Yes or no.  In all seven of your Tour de France victories, did you ever take banned substances or blood 
[00:12:00]  dope?  Yes.  In your opinion, was it humanly possible to win the Tour de France without doping?  Seven times in a row.  Oh.  Not in my opinion.  Wow.  Yeah.  That right there is the fucking, that's the meat of it right there.  Yeah, but he was defiant.  Did you see any of the clips of him basically calling everyone out for thinking he was doping?  Yes.  How dare you?  They played one of those clips last night, and then they came back to Oprah, and it was 
[00:12:30]  just so awkward.  Like, how do you lie like that?  The lie thing was...  I think he started believing his own lies.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah, you have to at a point when you're in that deep, you gotta just start believing it.  And then it goes on, Lance says the story was perfect, but a lie.  Lance says the story got ahead of him.  Lance says it wasn't just him, it was the culture.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he has to be careful.  He knows just about every guy in the top there. 
[00:13:00]  I'm saying just about every guy.  I feel like it's every guy, but I guess we can't say that officially.  Yeah.  I would say that the top cyclists, all of them, were doing it.  Yeah.  I wonder who the guy was that wasn't doing it, the first guy, and how high he got up.  I'm surprised.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  And I'm surprised he didn't rat.  What position would he be in?  Because he probably knew that even if he did, he would have fell short anyway.  Yeah.  Didn't Sam say something before about someone came in like 10th? 
[00:13:30]  I don't think I said that.  Maybe Travis did.  Yeah.  I don't know.  I'd confuse the fucking...  It might be...  The pieces of shit that walk around here all the time.  I think it might...  Hey, guys.  I think some are saying that the first guy that wasn't doping was the 10th place guy.  10th place guy, right.  I think.  Yeah.  Something like that.  Man.  For 13 years, you didn't just deny it.  You brazenly and defiantly denied everything you just admitted just now.  So why now admit it?  That's the best question.  It's the most logical question. 
[00:14:00]  It's the most logical question.  I don't know that I have a great answer.  Come on.  I will start my answer by saying that this is too late.  It's too late for probably most people.  And that's my fault.  You know, I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times. 
[00:14:30]  And as you said, it wasn't as if I just said no and I moved off it.  Right.  You were defiant.  Oh, yes.  I called other people liars.  I understand that.  And you said people's pants were on fire.  And while I've lived through this process, especially the last two years, one year, six months, three to three months.  I know the truth. 
[00:15:00]  The truth isn't what was out there.  The truth isn't what I said.  The truth is out there.  I love the X-Files.  Great show.  And now it's gone.  And this story was so perfect for so long.  And I mean that as I try to take myself out of the situation and I look at it.  You overcome the disease.  You win the Tour de France seven times.  You have a happy marriage.  You have children.  I mean, it's just this mythic.  Built on a lie.  Built on a lie.  It wasn't true.  Wow. 
[00:15:30]  Wow.  Yeah, yeah.  When you look at it from the outside, it's like, wow, that is inspirational.  It's almost as if, let's just say, hypothetically, you take this football player, right?  And his girlfriend and grandma die on the same day.  Wow.  And he transcends that and has, you know, and plays the game anyway.  Like a pro football player, college football player?  Ah, college.  And you're looking at it from the outside.  It looks great.  But meanwhile, let's just say there's a lie involved.  Let's say the guy's a flaming homosexual trying to cover up. 
[00:16:00]  You mean a queeb or a quay?  Oh.  Or actually light in the loafers or a moe?  Oh, boy.  A montage of Lance Armstrong denying doping.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, can we hear some of that?  That'll be way more exciting and entertaining than this Oprah interview.  Yeah, let's hear some of that.  I want to hear his defiance.  And this went on for years.  And what's so creepy about this, all the other cyclists and everyone involved in the sport had to watch him do this. 
[00:16:30]  And go, you motherfucker.  Motherfucker.  Exactly.  Sack of shit.  Because all the way back to what?  2000, probably even before 2007, I would say.  It goes way back to the time when he rode that bicycle with a big, giant front wheel and a little, tiny back wheel.  You know, now that Lance Armstrong's doing all this, I'm throwing my kid's big wheel out.  Yeah, fuck that.  Fuck that.  Fuck the bicycling.  Not getting involved with that dirty sport. 
[00:17:00]  That dirty activity.  Montage of Lance Armstrong just lying to everyone.  Let's talk a little bit about doping.  This is not the first time it's happened to me.  This stuff started back in 1998.  When I pissed in the bottle, as I told you earlier, having never taken performance enhancing drugs,  when I pissed in the bottle, there was not EPO in that piss or urine.  From our perspective and from what's gone on at U.S. Postal and Discovery and all of those tours,  we have nothing to hide.  I have never doped. 
[00:17:30]  I can say it again, but I've said it for seven years.  It doesn't help.  But the fact of the matter is I haven't.  He has told ESPN on the record and on camera that back in 1995, when the team was struggling,  that you announced to the team that you were going to begin doping  and you were encouraging other teammates to do the same.  What do you say to that account?  Now, again, complete nonsense.  My case, I mean, I came out of a life-threatening disease.  I was on my deathbed.  Do you think I'm going to come back into a sport and say,  OK, OK, doctor, give me everything you got.  I just want to go fast.  No way.  You're a liar! 
[00:18:00]  How many times have you said it?  I'm just trying to make sure your testimony is clear.  Well, if it can't be any clearer, then I've never taken drugs.  Then incidents like that could never have happened.  God damn liar!  Everybody wants to know what I'm on.  What am I on?  I'm on my bike.  Busted my ass six hours a day.  One word to sum this all up?  Credibility.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Wow.  Wowie. 
[00:18:30]  Yeah.  That is some lying going on in that clip, man.  There is some lies being told.  He was very inspirational for many people.  Yeah.  Oh, he actually did, like, spots, like, commercial things,  where he was like,  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  This is what I'm on.  Yeah.  I'm on my bike.  By the way, Deadspin gets the plug today.  Yeah.  That montage is on Deadspin.  Deadspin getting a lot of fucking attention. 
[00:19:00]  Unbelievable, right?  Did anyone else see, um, they picked the wrong guy from Deadspin to represent them  yesterday afternoon on CNN?  Fuck, I meant to write someone.  What happened?  Is there any way we could find it?  Yeah.  There was a guy from Deadspin on CNN, I think it was on Wolf Blitzer, the Situation Room.  Oh, look out.  Completely falling apart as he's trying to talk about the Tao situation.  He lost it?  He, he, he, you could see him sweating, he's panicking, because he realizes he's on live  TV.  He's looking down. 
[00:19:30]  He fucking choked.  At one point, he tries to start answering the question and just, like, went, I don't  even know where, and then had to go, could you, could you repeat the question?  Oh, he chokes.  Because he was trying to get back on track.  He was in a complete and utter panic.  That's fantastic.  And I blew it, because I should have wrote someone or, uh, or taped it myself.  Oh.  I love watching someone.  Yeah, if we can find that, it's great.  Love watching someone choke.  If someone out there has, uh, has a way to get that for us, please, uh, tweet us or something,  okay?  Uh, but first, uh, Lance says the story got ahead of him. 
[00:20:00]  Oh.  But what we see now, or what's out there now.  But didn't you help paint that picture?  Of course.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I did.  Yeah.  Um, um, and, and, and, you know.  That picture.  And a lot of, and a lot of people did.  Yeah.  And, and I, and listen, all the, all the, the fault and all the blame here falls on me.  But behind that picture and behind that story was momentum.  And whether it's fans or whether it's the media or whether, it just, it just gets going. 
[00:20:30]  And I lost myself and all that.  Um, and I, I'm sure there would be other people that couldn't handle it, but I, but I,  I certainly couldn't handle it.  And I was used to controlling everything in my life.  Well, here's the deal.  Lance Armstrong is a dick.  Yeah.  Apparently.  He's still trying to take care of just himself.  He's doing all this because, um, I've heard.  Self-preservation.  Yeah.  He wants to be a triathlete.  Yeah.  And, uh, he needs kind of the guy that gave him the lifetime ban to sort of look the other 
[00:21:00]  way and allow him to compete in triathlons.  Yep.  This guy wants to name names so fucking badly to help his case.  Yeah.  It's just for his, he wants to compete again.  Like I saw it in his eyes.  He's like, he just wants to blow it out of the water at this point and just name it,  uh, a shitload of names and people behind the scenes and basically say, look, here's  all the people that knew.  Mm-hmm.  So he should do that then.  But he's not doing that because that would hurt him even more.  No, he's trying to, um, keep, uh, as many friends as he has left. 
[00:21:30]  Right.  I think if he spilt the beans, yeah, they could get the Canseco thing where you just  look like an asshole.  Right.  And, uh, you're shunned.  Yeah.  But he wants to, he wants to do the Canseco badly.  Yeah.  But he, he knows it wouldn't help Lance Armstrong, but it would certainly help the sport.  I would, I would, I would guess.  Big name, big name in the sport of cycling.  Right.  And then we got one more clip from the Oprah show there.  You said to me earlier, you don't think it was possible to win without doping. 
[00:22:00]  Not in that generation, and, and I'm not here to talk about others in that generation.  It's, it's been well documented.  Mm-hmm.  Um, I didn't invent the culture.  Mm-hmm.  But I didn't try to stop the culture.  And that's, that, that, that's my mistake.  And that's what I have to be sorry for.  And that's what something, and the sport is now paying the price because of that.  And so I am sorry for that.  Um, I don't think, um.  I'm sorry.  I had, I didn't have access to anything else that, that, that nobody else did. 
[00:22:30]  Ah, okay.  So, yeah, yeah, you know.  Yeah.  Mm-hmm.  Access.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Other people, eh.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yes.  So that was, uh, I don't know, a little taste of the interview Oprah did, I guess.  Is there a part two tonight?  Yeah.  Yeah, I won't be watching.  Oh, they're splitting it up, huh?  I'm good.  How did it do in the ratings?  I'm sure it did well, right?  Did well?  I'm sure it did real well.  Got some overnights?  Got some overnights? 
[00:23:00]  I'm sure it was a big hit for the own network.  Finally.  Something people give a shit about on that channel.  Yeah.  Boy, I mean, I love the fucking Elo, but my God.  They're, uh, they're carving their niche.  Are they?  Yeah.  It's a slow build.  Pretty slow.  Slow build.  Compared to what she came off of with that fucking show.  She had that big Ofra show there, uh.  Oh, she was bored with that, though.  Yeah?  This is her way of reinventing herself.  I think they're happy over there, to be honest with you.  Are they?  Yeah. 
[00:23:30]  She's just not getting that big over the top.  Like pigs in shit, though?  Like pigs in shit.  Oh, that's pretty fucking happy.  She just doesn't have that big over the top, uh, show anymore, you know?  No.  No.  Uh.  Interesting.  Is there anything else on Lance?  Did we cover it?  Lance!  We're a big radio show.  We gotta cover this shit.  It was a weird interview, because it was like, everybody, we already knew that he doped,  because he said, I'm gonna go on the interview and confess to doping.  Right.  And then, so once he did it at the beginning of the interview, it was like, all right. 
[00:24:00]  Mm.  So now what else is there?  Man, it's way too late now, right?  Of course.  He wasn't convincing anyone at the end.  Everyone kind of just knew, I guess.  Mm.  Or had the feeling.  It's just a weirdo now.  A weirdo.  You think he just comes across as a weirdo?  Yeah.  How could you lie that wholeheartedly for that long, and then expect anybody to be like,  oh, I understand.  Oh, that is true.  And calling other people out.  Yeah.  Saying, you know, this fucking guy, what's wrong with him? 
[00:24:30]  When you lie like that, it's not just the lie, it's that you have the capacity to lie  like that.  Yeah.  That's worse sometimes than the actual lie is.  Right.  Like, what are you doing?  You're fucking, you're a piece of shit.  That's the kook thing that we mentioned yesterday.  The kook factor.  Either way, Lance Armstrong.  Cook or kook?  Yeah, you spell cook at first.  Maybe he's also a cook.  I'm sure he's gotta eat, but kook.  I just wanna make sure.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You know who else is a weirdo?  Kurt Schilling.  Your pal, Kurt Schilling. 
[00:25:00]  Mr. Broke.  My old pal, Kurt Schilling.  Mr. Broke-ass motherfucker, Kurt Schilling.  But we said it on the show, it's another thing that happened.  Oh, God.  I wanna start keeping track of this shit.  We really are seers.  We really see things as they are.  Do you remember, it was a mere few weeks ago, we said that he would be selling his bloody  sock?  Yeah.  He's selling his bloody sock.  Selling the bloody sock.  He's selling it.  How much for the bloody sock?  I don't know.  How much for the bloody sock?  How much?  The sock is expected to fetch at least $100,000. 
[00:25:30]  No, it's not.  What are you talking about?  $100,000, really?  Imagine your maid picks it up and throws it in the wash.  Yeah.  At your house.  I swear it was bloody.  I swear this is the bloody one.  Imagine that, Sam.  Your maid picks it up and throws it in the wash.  I have a lot of trouble with a lot of that statement.  The maid part is the first part that's unbelievable.  Oh, right.  I assume everyone has one.  Yes.  Jimmy Norton.  Is back from L.A.  Welcome back.  Dino's back.  Barney Dino's back. 
[00:26:00]  He had to take the bloody sock out of the Hall of Fame Museum.  What?  Excuse me, could I have that back?  I need that back?  It was on loan to the Hall of Fame.  Oh, he couldn't even.  Wow.  That had to be awkward.  Oh, that's awkward.  Here's your stupid bloody sock.  They probably threw it in his face.  And now he's not there anymore.  It was probably something for him to be like, yeah.  It was probably the only thing that the Hall of Fame kind of wanted from him.  You might remember.  I don't think they want a baseball or a mitt from him.  People are looking at it like, oh, that's it.  Look, it's the bloody sock. 
[00:26:30]  I saw that game and they showed the sock.  That was from what, 2004, I think?  Playoffs?  Yeah.  Do you think he tried to replace it with anything that he thought would be just as good?  Like, no, no, this is the other sock I had on, but it's not bloody.  It doesn't mean anything.  But that's how desperate he is.  He needs the money.  Oh, he needs some cash.  So he went to the Hall of Fame and said, I need my bloody sock back.  I've got to pay a few phone bills.  Poor bastard.  They're going to have 72 unsold cases of his video game on display instead.  Wow.  Yeah.  That video game didn't really pan out.  What video game did he think was going to just... 
[00:27:00]  It was the one he designed.  No, I know, but I don't even know.  He was a giant fan of EverQuest.  So he was trying to make his own EverQuest?  So he was trying to make his own version of EverQuest, and it bombed horrifically.  What was the problem with the game?  It just wasn't...  Nobody bought it.  No one bought it.  No, I know, but was the graphics bad?  Was the storyline bad?  Was the gameplay itself bad?  All of it.  No one liked any of it.  It was a knockoff cheap version of EverQuest.  So you would just play that, and then World of Warcraft comes out, and that just took off. 
[00:27:30]  And he puts all his money into it?  Every penny.  Not only all his money, he borrowed millions.  What's wrong with him?  He was set for life.  Oh, nightmare.  His baseball money alone, he was set for life, but then he got greedy, I guess.  Didn't the bank have to close, too?  Like, the bank that guaranteed his loan or something?  Yeah, I think he destroyed a bank.  Oh, boy.  He really fucking...  He fucked up.  He lost $50 million.  Oh, man.  He has a net worth of $1.75 now.  When you get a baseball player that thinks he's gonna... 
[00:28:00]  Because he enjoys a video game, that he can just go, I could do this.  But why would you take that chance?  There's no guarantees there.  He loves role-playing games.  He loves them.  Loves them.  And he thought, I'm gonna get an interview with Sam Roberts.  Yeah.  I'm gonna sell a lot of games.  It was really stupid.  But he had, like, the fucking, like, items of armor, like the Sock of Conquest.  You'd have to win it.  You're questing for that.  All his weapons were just bats and baseballs. 
[00:28:30]  Where there was a medieval mace, but you have to throw it instead of swing it.  It was a horrible game.  What a dumb, dumb thing to do.  Oh, well.  We just talked about Lance Armstrong.  What happened to him?  The big interview with Oprah, which was kind of...  It just kind of sat there.  I don't know why.  I was half-listening.  Apparently, they called him a dope.  Yeah, I'm not...  I don't even know.  I'm not blaming Oprah.  It just sat there, the interview.  It wasn't really...  Well, everyone knew it was gonna happen.  Yeah, I guess maybe that...  There was no shocking thing you said or... 
[00:29:00]  Aw.  But, uh...  I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did you have fire trucks meet you on the runway?  Yeah.  I just saw you tweet that.  Yeah, yeah.  I videoed, but nothing.  Yeah, it was fine.  Were you trying to get out of fucking Iran?  Yeah.  Ooh.  Argo.  They pieced my picture together from a bunch of shredded Facebook postings.  Yeah, no.  Do you feel like there was something wrong with the flight when it was in the air? 
[00:29:30]  No.  When we were landing, it was really weird.  Sometimes, because all the shades were all down, and sometimes when the wheels come down,  I try to see if I can guess the moment we're gonna land.  Because at the end, it's like...  Right, right, right.  There's that little...  Right, yeah.  When you land, and then you hit.  And I can usually get pretty close.  Oh.  But it was taking a while.  Uh-oh.  And then I felt like...  We were going back up a little bit.  Uh-oh.  Oh, fuck.  I felt it.  And I'm like, yeah, it felt a little weird. 
[00:30:00]  But then we were going, I guess we were still flying, and the flight attendant, her phone  went like, doom, doom, and she answered it.  Oh, shit.  And I'm like, that's never happened on a flight I've been on.  There's something wrong.  Oh, man.  But I wasn't nervous, because we were probably a thousand feet in the air, weren't we?  I wasn't nervous a thousand feet in the air.  Oh, man.  Because you're always a thousand feet in the air at some point before you crash.  Well, yeah, that's a good point.  Jesus, why weren't you nervous?  I'd be out of my mind.  No, because we weren't... 
[00:30:30]  I just didn't feel...  I don't know.  We weren't plumbing.  We were just...  We were landing.  They didn't tell you what was wrong?  No.  Well, she didn't tell anybody.  I happened to be in the second row, so I heard her say to the flight attendant, I have  very good ears, and she goes, there is a problem with the fuselage.  She just said...  Funny old couple, by the way.  There was a mechanical problem in the cockpit, and they said it's all straightened out, and  I don't know, so we're going to land, but they're going to have fire trucks meet us.  Nobody else knew what was happening.  What plane were you on?  What kind?  767, American, but they're older now. 
[00:31:00]  They're older planes.  Yeah, they're older.  So it's fine.  I mean, I wish something would have happened, but it was not.  Fire.  You wish something had happened.  No, I mean, like, you know, when we landed.  They probably just got a little light.  Were you hoping to go down a slide and go, wee?  That would have been fun.  Yeah, and then have to argue about leaving my laptop up there?  Not happening.  Not happening.  Not happening.  Not happening.  Everything's on there.  I'm taking it.  I'm taking it.  You're arguing with the flight attendant.  People are just waiting to emergency, leave the plane, you're just fucking everything  up.  As the smoke's getting thicker.  Well, the 787s are in deep shit. 
[00:31:30]  Oh, thank God almighty.  This fucking Boeing stock plummeting.  That might bankrupt Boeing, right?  They're grinding the planes all over the world, those 787s.  I think they'll be all right, because they got a bunch of other planes.  And it was a simple, dumb mistake.  They're using those lithium batteries that they know heat up real fast.  Lithium ion batteries?  Who made that mistake?  Why are they using them?  I don't know.  Very frightening, indeed.  Can they swap them out?  I guess so.  That's probably what they'll do. 
[00:32:00]  Yeah, they're going to figure something out.  But that plane that landed in Japan, because they had some smoke and stuff, they found like  the casing of the battery was blown up, and there was black liquid leaking out of it,  and it was hot and smoking.  Wow.  Fuck.  How do you miss that?  What pieces of shit these Dreamliners are?  But how do you miss that in the testing?  I know, right?  All the testing you got to do.  You would assume that would be the first thing.  Let's check out these batteries.  Yeah, make sure they don't overheat.  Let's leave them on overnight, and we'll check in the morning.  Something.  There's nothing more catastrophic than a mid-air fire.  Very rarely does a plane get through those. 
[00:32:30]  They usually wind up crashing.  We don't even know.  It's terrible.  Please.  Yeah.  We all fly.  Well, I know.  Unless an engine problem.  Okay, let's move on.  Even an engine problem they get through.  All right.  Yes, I'm saying.  We've got a bunch more.  You know, the mid-air fire?  Oh, boy.  That's a rough one.  I watched that air disaster show, and they've featured a few mid-air fires.  Just even fire.  There was one that was terrible.  There was a fire above the cockpit in the panels, and all the wires lit up, and the smoke 
[00:33:00]  got so thick they couldn't see shit.  Couldn't see out the windshield.  Couldn't see their instruments.  Nothing.  Oh, how horrible is that?  Didn't they have masks or whatever?  Yeah, but the smoke in the cockpit was so thick, they couldn't even see in front of  them.  Yeah.  It was awful.  The plane went down.  Then another one, it was a cargo.  It was half passengers, half cargo that they used to do in some fucking country, and the  cargo caught on fire.  And just, it was burning for a long-ass time, and then finally it just burned through the  plane and fucking crashed.  Oh, mid-air fire. 
[00:33:30]  How horrible would that be?  That doesn't sound fun.  I interrupted your horrible story by laughing, because Travis found the fucking guy from  Deadspin that completely panicked on CNN that I just mentioned, and he gave me a massive  thumbs up.  Like, yes.  I gave you two thumbs up.  Two thumbs up.  Oh, this is great.  Good.  It's great, right?  It's great.  The second track is just great.  I'll start with the first, just to warm everybody up.  Yeah, I think.  But, you know, Deadspin, obviously everyone is talking about Deadspin. 
[00:34:00]  They got a lot of promotion yesterday.  Yeah.  Did you see the tweet to Donald Trump, too?  That was great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Congratulations, Deadspin, on your, you know, breaking the story and stuff.  Then retweet, Donald Trump, fuck you.  Right.  Who retweeted him, Deadspin?  Deadspin, fuck you.  They're not going to be part of his nonsense.  Hilarious.  Anyway.  So, you know, all the Deadspin guys have been all over the place, obviously. 
[00:34:30]  We've seen a lot of them.  And apparently they were spread a little thin because they had to send out the B squad.  Yeah.  I mean, this guy isn't, he's not even one of the two reporters that broke the story.  No, no.  He's like, what is he, an IT guy from the back room?  But obviously.  You would think so.  Keeps the servers up.  Their phone was ringing off the hook, so the main guys were all over the place.  And then, like you just said, you said it.  I'm sorry.  They were spread a little thin.  They said, fuck it.  You have to go on CNN.  This is great for Deadspin.  It's the situation room.  Get your ass in there.  But I've never done interviews.  What did he break?  Which story? 
[00:35:00]  Manti Teo.  The Teo story.  I'm just, I'm very unfamiliar with it.  Oh, we're experts.  We are experts now.  And yesterday we didn't know shit.  I read a little bit on the plane from the paper.  Apparently this guy who wants the Heisman, he's got a weird name and an apostrophe in it.  Very hard to hashtag, by the way.  Yes.  Manti Teo.  He said that his girlfriend was sick and had died.  And she was some online hoax, weird thing that his teammates suspected but didn't call 
[00:35:30]  him out on.  And they began coming out and saying, yeah, we figured this once all the press coverage  began to happen.  Uh-huh.  Right.  And there's a picture of her in the paper today, the girl who he was saying was his  is alive.  Right.  My guess is that he's a homosexual.  All right.  Jimmy.  That's my guess.  Jimmy.  You might be the third person to say that in this room.  Let us let Sam read through the Opie and Anthony Manti Teo facts checklist that we put together 
[00:36:00]  yesterday from no knowledge.  We knew nothing when we came in yesterday.  We knew nothing yesterday.  Not one piece of info.  And this fact checklist almost went viral yesterday.  This is what.  It was on the cusp of going viral.  We spent over an hour pawing through what we knew, the facts, researching, checking,  cross-checking about this situation.  Well, yesterday, Jim, right before the show, me and I looked at each other like, you know  anything about the Teo thing?  I don't know.  Do you know?  No.  All right.  So we went on the air and we broke it down.  We have no idea.  Within an hour and a half, I could say I was an expert on this. 
[00:36:30]  We knew everything.  And with that, we have our checklist.  My first thought when I heard that he had a girlfriend that didn't exist, that he's gay.  All right.  First thing I thought of.  Well, let's go through the checklist.  That's on the list.  But we'll start with the top.  His dead girlfriend doesn't exist.  Right.  So you've got to start there.  He might be Samoan or Hawaiian.  Probably Hawaiian.  Long shot Spanish on dead grandma's side.  By the way, I think he's Samoan from Hawaii.  Yeah.  Okay.  I think he's Samoan in more ways than one. 
[00:37:00]  So we got that one right.  He puts the Mo in Samoan.  We got that one right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  It's also a fact.  The internet is a thing.  The internet is indeed a thing.  We learned that yesterday.  We think it's a hoax.  Uh-huh.  Not the internet.  Right.  Slight chance.  This is yours, Jimmy.  Right here.  Okay.  Slight chance he's a bit light in the loafers slash Mo.  Okay.  Also, there's a small chance that he's a queeb or a quay.  Yes.  But of course, we don't know.  And obviously, there's nothing wrong with that.  Right. 
[00:37:30]  Another fact.  Everyone loves to catfish.  Everyone loves doing that catfish thing.  And if we stop there for a second, the catfish people are beyond happy.  Oh, they're in here.  They're great guys.  How many people are going to be watching the catfish documentary now that didn't see it  the first time around?  They're just saying catfish on the news all the time now.  But this is what amazes me.  These guys on CNN, all of them.  I watched all three.  They had no awareness of that documentary.  Uh-huh.  How are you in the public eye doing a news program and not aware of it? 
[00:38:00]  They're all idiots.  And when the movie came out, it got kind of a nice buzz.  Yeah.  And it was a different type of subject.  And now they play that movie on MTV every two days.  Right.  Yeah, because they have the TV show.  But they're like, this is the first I'm hearing of it.  And I hear there's a documentary.  I'm like, wow, man.  What is this catfish?  What is this catfish?  But anyway, all right.  Uh, yes, sir.  Everyone loves to catfish.  There's a lot of red flags here.  Yeah, yeah.  It's on our fact list.  The news media are a bunch of lazy bums.  Lazy bums.  We got that.  And, uh, they were trying to explain themselves yesterday.  And even CNN's like, so you're telling me, they actually said this to a reporter yesterday, 
[00:38:30]  so you're telling me what happens in journalism is you see the story somewhere else two or  three times.  So then you go with it as well.  And the guy actually said yes.  But then I'm looking and I'm going, hey, CNN, you do the exact same fucking thing.  Right.  Don't make believe you don't do that.  Yes.  No one checks their shit anymore.  Especially with the internet.  You see it here and there.  You're like, oh, it's got to be true.  Well, let's put it on our page.  They don't do that on the newsroom.  No.  So, uh, when he talks, we get douche chills. 
[00:39:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was when he was giving his little speech about, uh, his girl.  I've not heard it.  Oh, it's embarrassing.  Because you know he knows it's fake.  Oh, it's terrible.  He's a kook either way.  And that's in bold.  Well, you did write kook at first.  That was just a quick typo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  But now it's right.  Regis must be mad.  Very big Notre Dame fan.  Yeah.  I love it.  I don't care if he is a quib or a quag.  Galvin's a quib.  And a mo. 
[00:39:30]  We're done with the word if.  Yeah.  This was an hour and a half into this, Jimmy.  We finally said stop.  We're not saying if anymore.  It's like if he knew about this or if he, no, he knew.  Yeah.  What a fucking liar.  Yes.  A liar.  That's actually covered in the final fact.  Oh, what is it?  He's either a liar and slash or a complete asshole.  Or a mo.  Right.  Well, a mo was covered earlier.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  So maybe he's a mo.  He's a Mormon, so he can't explore the mo in most cases. 
[00:40:00]  So now you're like, well, everyone sees me without a girl around.  Oh, my God.  This Internet thing is perfect for me.  I'm going to just fucking go with this.  And then it'll keep people at bay.  I was listening to Ron and Fez yesterday on the way home because we had done over a half  hour of extra radio yesterday, if you remember, Opie.  Oh, we sure did.  That was to avoid Barry.  Yes.  Yes.  So just get Barry outside the studio.  We'll do a lot more radio for everybody.  So on the way home, I was able to listen to a fantastic eight minutes of the after show. 
[00:40:30]  And I was able to listen to Ron and Fez, right?  And they were talking about this very subject.  And the way Ronnie was talking and what I got out of Ronnie.  Ronnie's very perceptive, very intelligent man.  I was leaning more toward the fact that this guy is a mo.  You were about to give it up yesterday.  Quay.  I know.  But now, that's my number one guess on this one.  Of course.  Now, I'm leaning way against that.  Why? 
[00:41:00]  Because there was a report yesterday of a Notre Dame teammate saying that we saw him  with girls all the time.  Yeah, but seen him with girls on campus, which made them doubt his girlfriend's story.  Right.  That doesn't matter.  Fag hags, they call him.  You hang out with the girls.  You date your court for public.  You got to do that.  Right.  For the public image, especially you're going to the Heisman Trophy.  You're a Mormon.  He's fully aware that, you know.  I think he's just crazy.  Another roommate, while he was with those girls, heard him just saying,  Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew, the whole time.  Or open your legs, Father. 
[00:41:30]  I want to throw the football in like the commercial.  Right.  Like in the tire swing.  She wants to use her cunt as a fucking football hammer.  We get it, Jim.  Sorry, I just wanted to say cunt.  You're right.  I wasn't done.  But he has an internet girlfriend for four years, and he doesn't want any physical contact.  Yeah, yeah.  It's just nonsense.  It's nonsense.  She was in the hospital dying of leukemia.  He never visited her, but he has this great love for her.  She dies.  Nothing was sent.  No flowers were sent.  He didn't go to a funeral. 
[00:42:00]  There was no funeral.  He didn't know about it.  Didn't know where she was buried so he could kneel by the graveside and stuff.  This is a guy who is trying to cover up questionable sexuality with a lie.  Or he's just a compulsive liar.  No, because here's why.  Or he's one of these asshole compulsive liars.  Mormon.  You got a Mormon at a Catholic school.  Shunned if he's gay.  The father helped him out by saying a story about how they had been to Hawaii together.  Right.  How they went to Hawaii together.  You think the father was all in on this?  Because the father wants to cover up the fact that his son, Jesus Christ, you pissy-eyed faggot. 
[00:42:30]  There's nothing wrong with being gay in this day and age.  Damn right!  But in his situation, it certainly would be a problem.  Right.  In his situation, it's a problem.  Mormon, Catholic school, like you said, and going for the Heisman Trophy.  So he starts getting these urges.  He wants to cover this shit up.  And the best way to do it without having to touch that yicky, yicky vagina is saying that you got a girlfriend.  And you go, oh, you've met. 
[00:43:00]  You've hung out.  You've done this.  But mostly it's online.  And you know what's great?  Why would he say she died and that we broke up?  Unless he's a compulsive liar.  Well, I'm sure he's...  Even if he's gay, he's a compulsive liar who's also gay.  Was he told that she died or...  Yeah.  His brother called him.  He knew...  So maybe he knew everyone was on the scent and he had to end the whole thing.  No, I don't think so because no one was questioning.  This is the weirdest fucking story, man.  What a tension, whore.  Yes.  I spent most of the day watching the coverage on this and just trying to figure shit out on my own.  It's so weird. 
[00:43:30]  No one was questioning.  Nobody gave a shit until she died six hours after his grandmother died and became this giant story.  So his grandmother really died.  And then six hours later, he gets a call from his brother saying his girlfriend died of...  She had leukemia.  You know what?  I feel what that's about.  He's like, okay, I can't just say she died because people are going to be reading my emotions.  So I'm going to piggyback it with my grandma dying where I'm really feeling...  I'm feeling fucking emotions here.  So he can fake it better because he's got...  Right, now I throw the girlfriend on top of it and then they're not going to be able to read me when I'm on TV talking about this. 
[00:44:00]  Because I really am distraught about my grandma dying.  It's the only way it came out that way.  Good cover story.  What's great is...  It's like Argo.  If he's not gay, he's just a crazy liar.  Now everybody thinks he's a crazy liar and they still think he's gay.  Still think he's gay.  He's having a miserable time.  Wow.  Regardless.  Just kidding.  And his NFL prospects are, they said, I quote, dropping like a rock.  Oh my God.  They said that on TV this morning. 
[00:44:30]  Just watch your fucking career go down the shitter.  Because he's down there in Florida going through all the motions.  Wait, is he still playing?  What is it?  The Combine?  No.  No, no.  It's over.  He was supposed to go sixth to the Buffalo Bills is about where all the experts were saying.  I'm certainly not an expert.  All I do is see what the experts are saying and then I repeat it.  Yes.  Totally.  But he was supposed to go sixth and I guess that would be like the Bills.  And now they're saying...  Low Bills.  I think Travis was telling me.  Now they're saying he'll be lucky to go in the first round at all. 
[00:45:00]  Wow.  But someone will take their chance with him because he's a very good player.  All right.  You want to hear the Deadspin guy?  You have to.  Yes.  And then we got to update our Tao facts.  We got a whole fact sheet.  And then also something else I just remember we got to play.  A caller got through to Mike Francesa.  Do you got it?  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Do you got it?  I can pull it up real quick.  Oh, no.  What happened?  I think we got to play that first.  What happened?  It's hilarious.  I love when Mike gets told.  And let me tell you something.  Mike Francesa is just a fucking dick. 
[00:45:30]  Come on.  Because there are times you should just go with this shit.  He wasn't going with it?  No.  He is a fucking ornery cunt, isn't he?  They need water.  He just gets so upset.  Yeah.  You know, there are times, sure, some of these assholes will get to you and make you upset.  But something like this, just go with it.  Here's the clip.  I don't even want to give it away.  I'm pretty sure we're talking about the same clip.  Yeah, I would imagine we are.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Vinny and Rockaway.  Now, that's a player who said that.  So, again, he didn't put his name on it. 
[00:46:00]  Vinny and Rockaway.  What's up, Vinny?  Hey, Mikey.  How are you doing?  What's up?  What's happening?  I've got a question.  If all this speculation that Mandy Taylor is a homosexual, do you think he's the greatest  homosexual linebacker of all time?  What a stupid question.  I mean, just, you know, you can't make it up.  Guy, you know, actually sat on the phone like at least a half hour and 45 minutes to actually  make that contribution.  Look, that's the best thing you can do.  He certainly laughed a little bit, but then he had to go with that angle. 
[00:46:30]  It's like, why wouldn't you just lose it and go with that for a minute?  All sexual.  I love.  I love when these guys do this.  I love how much people love messing with Mike Francesca.  And I know we certainly share an audience with him, you know, probably not, maybe not a  huge, huge share, but there's certainly people that listen to us and then listen to Mike Francesca.  I just want to say this show loves when you guys do that.  Oh, yeah.  Send them all our way. 
[00:47:00]  Because it drives him nuts.  Stop waiting 30 minutes to ask if he's the greatest homosexual.  He laughed, though, man.  He thought that was very funny, but then he had to be Mike and be like, oh.  And then he goes, he waited 30 minutes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You wait 30 minutes to say something like that on a radio show.  That's well worth the wait.  That guy was like, yes, of course.  I would have waited two hours to do that.  Score.  Yes.  That was fucking great.  The greatest homosexual linebacker ever.  He should answer the question.  Oh, that's good. 
[00:47:30]  Then they could just go, well, I don't know.  Well, Chris would have went with it.  Well, I don't know if it's going to be the greatest homosexual linebacker ever.  Let me look on my laptop.  Punch up some factual information.  If he came out and said he was gay, to me, that's the only way to stop this from making  him look like he's a psychopath.  Whether he is or not.  Just come out and say you're gay.  Yeah.  Just so you don't like Dick.  Just say you love Dick.  Yeah.  Just love that Dick.  That's really strange.  Because then people will understand and go, well, it was a lie that spun out of control 
[00:48:00]  and he was trying to cover.  He's an athlete and he's trying to cover.  I think people would be more understanding about that than this cocksucker just lied.  And if he is the victim of a hoax, how stupid is this guy?  Yeah.  He's obvious.  To have an online girlfriend for four years.  Anyway, so John Coblin.  I'm sorry to John Coblin.  I am John Coblin.  Obviously, John Coblin is not comfortable being on TV.  Yeah.  And Deadspin was spread a little thin, so they put John on CNN. 
[00:48:30]  And I apologize in advance to Deadspin because we actually like you guys.  Oh, boy.  But come on.  We like some of the shit you're doing over there.  But.  Dude, they must have been laughing like, dude, you fucked up so bad.  So he was on the Situation Room and the first clip, not as bad, but it's a good setup to  see that.  See, he started off kind of okay and it just got worse and worse.  He's with Deadspin Magazine, which first broke this story.  Thank you so much for coming in, John.  John, it's hard to keep all of these pieces together. 
[00:49:00]  I mean, first off, I'd like to know.  I think his heart's just slamming in his chest right now.  Right now, his heart's going, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  He's probably had an inner dialogue.  Like, I can do this.  Oh, God.  And then he hears the ear.  Now he's hearing it in his earpiece.  He's like, ah, ah.  He's just fucking hot.  Two seconds, George.  Two seconds.  Yeah, yeah.  The lights are a little.  You ready?  The lights are a little bright here, but okay.  She's going to throw it over to you.  You're going to go, what?  Throw what?  He's freaking out.  All right, John, here you go. 
[00:49:30]  Here you go.  Oh, God.  I just remember these moments when we first started doing TV, man.  I remember standing in that fucking little wing area on Letterman.  That was the worst one ever.  Yeah.  I was standing in the little wing.  It's like, ladies and gentlemen, our next guest.  And I'm like, ah, ah.  I was behind that thing, freaking out.  What about when he walked over?  It's like, he's coming through the TV.  Oh, no.  It was him in a fucking person.  Dude, you get so nervous, and then you're fucking, you know, you're fine.  That's the difference.  You sort of just have to go with that energy, I guess. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know.  He knows.  Yeah, you shit your pants and move along.  He was tweeting like people were.  Oh, he knows?  Yeah, and he was replying to people going, choked.  Yeah, that was rough.  Choke.  Oh.  That was rough.  Oh, brother.  Got nervous and choked.  All right, so he's admitting it.  Yeah.  I loved it.  I couldn't believe I was seeing this.  All right, here we go.  And what you have learned about Ronaya Tuiasasopo and his connection to this story. 
[00:50:30]  What we have discovered is that we are almost 100% certain that he is behind the Twitter feed  of the girlfriend, the girlfriend that we now know is not real.  We know this because of the reporting that we just heard, something that we reported  at Zedspin.com, which is a high school classmate of the guy.  Oh, hold on, hold on.  See, you hear that?  His mouth is dry.  It's really dry.  His mouth is a parched desert right now. 
[00:51:00]  And he's on a roll that he can't get off of now.  But he's rolling with his tongue, and he's kind of getting the shit out.  But at any moment, this can fall apart.  He's trying so hard to hold it together, and you can hear it.  You can hear it.  Didn't you say the guy?  The guy, the girl, the girlfriend.  The wheels are wobbly right now.  They're going to fall completely off.  He started out okay.  Yeah, yeah.  He's answering the question, and I know everything about this story, and I'm completely lost.  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  You really, he's not making a good presentation, but at least he's trying to hold it together.  He's getting words out.  Remember that when you listen.  You can hear it, because this is coming apart.  And I love the...  I'll go back a little bit.  Yeah, go back so we can hear his dry mouth.  Oh, this poor fuck.  Turd.  Something that we reported at Zedspin.com, which is a high school classmate.  The classmate of the guy, he is...  The guy? 
[00:52:00]  Of the guy, isn't it?  How about you just say man-tied?  That's tail, right?  Yeah, yeah.  Of the guy?  Let's go, a classmate of the guy.  So now...  What's he talking about?  He's talking about the roommate?  The guy who created the guy.  Oh, the guy, okay.  I gotta go back.  We'll give him a very confusing name.  Reporting that we just heard, something that we reported at Zedspin.com, which is a high school  high school classmate of the guy.  He...  The photo that was used was not of any girlfriend, was not of Teo's girlfriend, but it turns out 
[00:52:30]  that it was in fact somebody else who identified Rania as the person who wound up...  She wound up sending him a photo.  So we know that for sure, that he is behind it.  How well does he know Teo?  We know that they've spoken on Twitter together.  We know that they also have...  That the Rania's family also went to USC, and they did meet in person. 
[00:53:00]  How well did they know each other beyond that?  We don't know.  So he comes back a little bit.  It's a little bit of a run-on sentence.  Any one of us in this room would have done a better job.  Right, right, right.  The wheels are definitely falling off.  But here's the clip where...  Oh, that's not the fall apart, Clint?  No, no.  No, that's sort of giving you the whole vibe.  Like, he was kind of okay, then fell apart, then brought it back near the end there a little bit.  But that's only because it's like when you push a go-kart down a hill. 
[00:53:30]  Right.  You don't have any control of it, but it's going straight for a little while.  Right, right.  Like, he's trying...  You could tell at any minute, one distraction, he was fucked up.  Here we go.  Strap in.  And now, yeah, yeah.  Oh, this poor motherfucker.  And you could see him sweating and looking down, and he was basically praying that someone  was going to give him the hug.  It's okay.  It's only the biggest story of the day on CNN.  Right.  Everyone's watching.  So, what's Dead Spins reporting?  Ah, I don't know! 
[00:54:00]  That right there is the distraction.  He had to stop, and it stopped his role, and now he's got to restart, and he's a mess.  What?  So, yeah.  Oh, no.  The follow-up question is what's going to get him in the end.  So, what's Dead Spins reporting at this point on whether or not Manti Teo was himself involved  with making up this story, making up this persona, making up this girlfriend? 
[00:54:30]  All right.  We believe that he certainly had a connection with Renaya, and beyond that, I mean, there  are a lot of red flags.  I mean, the fact that, you know, the fact that Renaya and Teo, they, A, know each other,  and, B, the fact that what wound up happening is we have Teo who wound up, Teo wound up,  excuse me, Teo wound up, um... 
[00:55:00]  Did Teo wound up?  Oh, my God.  Oh, he's in a loop.  You didn't even get...  Oh, he can't...  He's stuck in a loop.  You didn't even make it to the punchline.  It gets even better.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  The fact that Renaya...  Wait for the punchline.  ...and Teo, they, A, know each other, and, B, the fact that what wound up happening is  we have Teo who wound up... 
[00:55:30]  Teo wound up...  Excuse me.  Teo wound up...  I'm sorry.  Can you repeat the question one more time?  I'm sorry about that.  I was just asking how much you think that Teo is involved with making up this girlfriend.  Yes.  The fact that there is plenty of evidence.  I mean, there is some evidence insofar as the fact that Teo, first of all, they absolutely 
[00:56:00]  do know each other, and we also know that Teo has...  He came out and has called it a hoax, so he wound up denying it, but beyond that, not  entirely sure.  And the guys who wound up reporting the story, Jack Dickey and Tim Burke.  Oh, wow.  That was atrocious.  Oh, did he lose every bit of concentration.  And they got this big scoop, so they don't want to...  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:56:30]  And Teo...  Do you think she knew he's panicking?  Oh, yes.  That was the easiest question.  I would have loved...  Do you think Teo's in on it?  Dude, I would have loved to have been in the booth during that, where the producers, they  probably were cracking up, going, look at this fucking guy, he's losing it.  I like when he says, insofar, which is...  Insofar as...  He has to make words come out of his mouth.  Teo...  Or when he goes, uh, yes.  Like, got it all together now.  Because she tried to help him.  She's like, oh, so did they know?  He's like, yeah, yes. 
[00:57:00]  Yes.  Yes.  Here we are.  Indubitably.  Back on point.  Wow.  Oh, I saw that yesterday.  I couldn't believe enough shit.  Like I said, yeah.  What a nervous Nelly he was.  We had to play that dance, but I'm sorry.  Wow, fantastic.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  Well, we'll take a break, and then we'll get the latest on the Teo story.  We got our...  We'll compare what...  Our bullet points here.  Let's compare what broke in the news yesterday, post our show.  Okay.  And compare it to our checklist.  Okay.  And see how far ahead of the curve this program is. 
[00:57:30]  Okay, we can do that.  Also, we got Josh Gad coming in.  Book of Mormon guy.  Oh.  Who has moved on, and he's on 1600 Penn.  Yes.  And Dominic's coming in.  Dominic Monaghan.  Monaghan, yes.  Oh, of course.  From, of course, the...  Not the Hobbit.  It's the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  And Lost.  Drive Shaft.  Drive Shaft.  He was, yes, one of the members of Drive Shaft.  Wow, really?  Yeah.  Main song.  You ball, everybody.  Nice.  Oh, that was his song. 
[00:58:00]  Terrible song.  Yeah.  You ball, everybody.  Uh-huh.  Yeah.  Is he married to Kate in real life?  Oh, to everybody.  No, they dated for a long time.  Oh, they dated.  Oh.  And then we got the stutter from American Idol that everyone else is talking about, so  we'll fucking do that.  Well, not live.  Huh?  We have a recording of that person.  Ah.  You had to say that?  Oh, sorry.  We could have...  Was that a tease?  Yeah, we could have made believe we had the stutter in there.  Damn it!  This is the Opie and HL. 
[00:58:30]  What's SiriusXM?  Thanks for calling the Opie and Anthony F.U. line.  Here's the latest batch of F.U.s.  Fuck you!  Yeah, I'd like to say fuck you to my little dick, you asshole.

[01:00:30]  866-FU-LINE-1.  That's 866-FU-LINE-1.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's Friday.  It's Friday. 
[01:01:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  I like singing.  You know when they used to go, on the radio, sick of all the same old shit, and they would  cut it out because you can't sing.  Ah!  Nah, nah, nah. 
[01:01:30]  You started that years ago.  I can't listen to Green Day.  I know.  I can't either.  Like he needs to blow his nose, right?  Yeah.  He was in This Is 40.  Had a little cameo.  He did?  Yep.  I still haven't seen that movie.  He went to the, uh, the, uh, uh, what? 
[01:02:00]  I forgot his name.  Yeah, I didn't even know.  The cruel-to-be-kind guy.  Right.  Who's the cruel?  Uh, Nick Lowe.  Well, that's not him.  And the rumor?  Remember, it wasn't him, though.  What do you mean?  The guy in the movie wasn't the cruel-to-be-kind guy.  Oh.  He was the other guy.  You're talking to Nick Lowe.  Oh, yeah.  Cruel-to-be-kind in the right measure.  So, who was the other guy?  The other guy was the other guy.  Graham Parker.  Graham Parker.  Yeah.  Right.  Yes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, uh, Green Day guy went to see the Graham Parker show. 
[01:02:30]  Oh.  So, he had a little cameo.  And this is 40.  Yes.  That's how black people say Billy Joel.  Billy Joel.  I saw Billy Joel.  And then they go, who?  The guy from Green Day?  Nah, nigga, the motherfucker, that fucking, she got a way about her shit.  Right.  I guess, uh, Dear Abby passed.  Aw.  Yeah.  Didn't she?  So young.  94.  Oh.  That was one of those, didn't she die years ago?  That was Ann Landers.  Oh, I understand.  They were twins. 
[01:03:00]  They were twins.  They were competing with each other.  Yes.  Dear Abby had 100 million readers.  And what about Ann Landers?  Uh, she had about 15,000.  You know how they stopped writing their own shit back in, like, the 70s or something?  80s.  Was it the 80s?  I think it was 80.  They stopped writing their own shit.  84 or something.  I don't know.  They just had their name in that dumb, old, ancient picture that every time Jimmy would  bring up that imaginary woman, Helen.  Yeah.  I imagine Ann Landers.  Oh, yeah, of course.  Ann Landers.  They look like Ann Landers at Dear Abby. 
[01:03:30]  And, uh, yeah, they just kind of put it off to someone else at the paper, but they would  use their picture and their name.  You sure about that?  Yeah.  Because I think the Dear Abby lady started writing it with her daughter.  Really?  So kind of the daughter was the one you're talking about.  Oh, the daughter was writing it?  But I think they acknowledged that, and they showed both of them, uh, in the column.  They're, pheh, pheh.  Whoa!  Flush you.  Oh, shit.  I got the flu.  How's that flu?  Oh, no.  How's that flu treating you?  I started an advice column, and nobody bought it because the name was wrong. 
[01:04:00]  What was the name, Jimmy?  Dear Lerfki.  Lerfki.  Yes.  I have to write a letter.  Dear Lerfki.  And you had to get the spelling right, or you would never get their emails.  L-H-E-E, and the second E had the umlaut over it.  Umlaut.  R-F.  An umlaut.  K-E-Y.  Hey, we've gone a half hour without playing the Mike Francesa clip.  What's wrong with us?  Oh, please.  Go ahead.  Now, that's a player who said that, so, again, he didn't put his name on it.  Vinny and Rockway.  What's up, Vinny? 
[01:04:30]  Hey, Mikey.  How you doing?  Big Ben.  What's up?  What's happening?  I've got a question.  If all this, uh, the speculation that Mandy Taylor is a homosexual, do you think he's the  greatest homosexual linebacker of all time?  What a stupid question.  I mean, just, you know, you can't make it up.  Guy, you know, actually sat on the phone, like, at least a half hour, 45 minutes to actually  make that contribution.  Look, the caller was great.  It was great.  But what makes it so much fun is that he gets so mad. 
[01:05:00]  He's such a baby.  He's just a baby about it.  It frustrates him.  You're not going to have that highbrow sports talk show, Mike.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Especially when you're taking calls for Vinny.  Vinny.  Hey.  Hey, Mike.  Right.  Hey, fucking best homosexual linebacker.  He laughed, though.  The laugh gives him away.  The laugh totally gives him away.  Like, he thought it was funny.  He finds jokes like that funny.  But then he's like, oh, wait, wait, wait.  Yeah, uh-oh.  Uh-oh. 
[01:05:30]  Mm-hmm.  All right.  I wish he was awake.  What's the latest on Tao?  Tao.  Tao.  By the way, when Scott and Todd do that Tao fucking parody, could we have it?  I recorded today to see if they did, and they didn't, and I'm checking today as well.  It's Friday.  I mean-  I know Todd had to have done it.  You know Todd is going to do the Tao Tao fucking-  Either that or the hot, hot, hot version.  Buster Poindexter.  What do you mean?  He uses those two songs all the time. 
[01:06:00]  Oh, okay.  Oh, he does.  Oh, he has go-to songs?  Oh, yeah.  That he uses for his parodies?  I didn't know that.  So, like, Tao, Tao.  Tao.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Well.  As soon as they do it, I'll bring it in.  And you can't even, like, try to imagine what he's going to say in the song, because  he shoehorns in so badly that it doesn't matter.  He can just make up anything and throw it in.  So someone should just listen to their show all day long, because it's going to hit today.  Oh, it will.  The big song is going to hit today.  Big Friday.  Big Friday.  We're going to be playing a song party.  Tao. 
[01:06:30]  I have an imaginary girlfriend in my bed.  The girlfriend died.  The girlfriend died.  The girlfriend died.  Oh, it was.  It was.  It was one of their fucking phone breaks.  What are they?  The scam?  What?  Phone scam.  Phone scam.  Ah, Tao, the victim of one of our phone scams.  We called him on the cell with the girlfriend.  And then she died. 
[01:07:00]  I have a little bit of a...  So she had leukemia.  Bah.  My friend had leukemia.  Oh, Margie.  Here's the latest on Tao.  She fought so hard, Margie.  She had the leukemia.  Ladies on Tao.  I guess the Tao guy was supposed to talk yesterday.  Very suspicious that he did not.  He needs to talk.  Yeah.  Because his stock is going down drastically as far as the NFL goes. 
[01:07:30]  Well, yeah.  There's a lot of people thinking he's a whack job and maybe they shouldn't take a chance with him.  So if he's the victim of a hoax, he's got to get himself in front of some cameras.  Certainly does.  And keep pushing that point.  But he was supposed to sit down for an interview with ESPN.  He did not.  I think Travis was telling me the guy that was going to interview him for ESPN is a no-nonsense type of guy.  No nonsense?  There wasn't going to be a lot of fluff.  He wasn't going to allow him to just answer the questions without a lot of follow-up questions. 
[01:08:00]  Wow.  So I think maybe some are saying Tao panicked a little bit.  Yeah.  He's getting together with his people and trying to figure this shit out.  Well, we'll see what the future brings.  But I think it's going to bring homosexuality.  Yes.  Either that or he's going to do something drastic.  Like?  I don't know.  Oh, you think he might...  I don't know.  Uh-oh.  You never know.  The disgrace.  The public disgrace.  Oh, public disgrace is so fucking bad.  Sports Illustrated released the full transcript of their interview in September with Tao about Lene. 
[01:08:30]  In it, Tao clearly had a hard time explaining how he met her and how she died.  He's in on this.  Yeah.  He's so in on this.  Yeah.  How do you pretend you don't know your own girlfriend?  Of course you do.  He's full of shit.  Yeah.  He's full of shit.  He's lying.  But why?  That much in love and he doesn't visit her in the hospital.  Come on.  He's probably a combination of a homosexual.  This is a guess.  A homosexual and a compulsive liar. 
[01:09:00]  Or just a crazy attention who are a compulsive liar.  Well, a lot of his teammates saying he loved the attention.  Do you suck nicks?  Do you suck nicks?  Do you suck nicks?  Oh, wow.  Loved the attention.  You got the whole stadium feeling bad for you.  Yeah.  He loved it.  So he kept going with it.  On how they met.  We met just, um...  Just she knew my cousin.  And kind of saw me there.  So just kind of regular.  That's his exact quote from the Sports Illustrated, um, transcript.  When asked how she died, it was just so sudden. 
[01:09:30]  I don't know the details of it.  It was just a surprise.  How did your girlfriend die?  How's it a surprise if she's suffering from leukemia?  That's not a surprise there.  Surprise.  I know people come back from leukemia, but how is it a surprise?  Maybe on their first date, he said something about leukemia, which she deemed negative.  So, like, maybe he said, like, I don't care how hot a girl is.  If she had leukemia, I wouldn't put my dick in her.  He just said that for no reason during a movie.  No reason.  They were watching a Jennifer Aniston movie, and he's throwing popcorn in his mouth, 
[01:10:00]  and he just blurted that out.  I'd never fuck a chick with leukemia.  Blood cancer?  Nerds to you, I'd say.  And he kept eating popcorn.  Nerds.  Did she file that away and it meant the Rolodex?  I won't be telling him.  It was sudden.  As we go through the latest facts, this one's fucked up, too.  These are all fucked up.  He never received any of the letters Lene wrote her.  Never received.  It says wrote her, so wrote him.  Wrote him.  Yeah, so she's writing the letters, because he said she wrote a lot of letters, 
[01:10:30]  but he never saw the letters.  Instead, this is how fucked up this is in this day and age.  Instead, they were read to him by family members over the phone, or a photo of them were sent  to his iPad.  But if a photo of them were sent to his iPad, why didn't he read them?  Oh, my God.  Can he read?  Or is she going to get all the letters back like Forrest did?  Yeah, yeah.  When he was writing fucking...  Oh, because Jenny was a fucking whore.  Yeah.  She wasn't taking cock. 
[01:11:00]  She was standing on a ledge.  Yeah.  She was writing...  No one writes old school letters anymore.  You would write...  No.  An email.  Or a text.  Or a text.  That's your letter here.  This is such bullshit.  No one hoax you?  No.  You dumb apostrophe.  Yeah.  Stupid name.  He still trends on Twitter.  That's pretty amazing.  Everyone's trying to figure out how to fucking write his name, and it still trends.  I know.  That's amazing shit.  Yeah.  Teo claims he found out Linnea was a hoax on December 6th, yet two days later...  This is a fact, by the way. 
[01:11:30]  Yes.  He gave an interview online about his grief over her death.  So after he even knew.  He finds out it's a hoax.  Yeah.  And then two days later, still going with it.  How did he find out it was a hoax, did he say?  He spoke about her again on December 10th in a newspaper interview.  I don't know.  I don't know, because that's all fucking shady.  This guy's full of turkey.  Oh, boy.  Notre Dame classmates and teammates.  We were wondering about this yesterday.  Thank God there's some sane people that go to that college, speculated that Linnea never existed, 
[01:12:00]  but never aired their suspicions publicly, because he's a big fucking deal on campus.  I knew a guy who faked leukemia.  No.  Yes, I do.  He was a guy I knew who was a sober person, let's just say.  I'm out.  If he faked leukemia, and he would share about it when we were all in these particular places together, 
[01:12:30]  and we would talk about having leukemia, and he would talk, and a part of me would go,  he's full of shit.  Oh, my God.  You know it?  He's full of shit.  Yeah.  It was a nagging instinct, and I felt guilty about it, and then me and a friend of mine were talking,  and we just kind of got around to it.  We're like, eh, Bill, yes.  He's full of shit.  Wow.  I think he's full of shit.  And there was another guy we knew who actually did have leukemia.  Wow.  Who would talk about this other guy and get emotional. 
[01:13:00]  Oh, God.  And he had dug himself in so deep, and then he finally had to come out and admit to people  that he didn't have it.  Wow.  Oh, it was awful.  But you feel like an asshole even bringing it up that he's full of shit, right?  At the time?  You felt guilty thinking it.  Of course.  It felt so uncompassionate.  But you just knew, huh?  Instinct.  There was something he said.  We all believed in it.  There was just something he said one time, and I was like, eh.  Was it a Tucker Max situation?  I don't remember what it was, but yeah.  He said he had cured it with Tic Tacs. 
[01:13:30]  And Jimmy said, I think he's lying.  Yeah.  Or he said something about it.  The first time I met, he called him Louis Kimia.  Louis Kimia.  Louis Kimia.  I go back to Tucker Max, because that day when we all realized at the exact same time  that that guy was full of shit and our humble opinion.  Yes.  Our interview with him got a lot of attention recently, because there's a guy that's obsessed  with him that is another writer, I think.  I didn't know this guy. 
[01:14:00]  And thinks he's full of shit?  Oh, he goes after him all the time.  So then some of our listeners turned him on to the interview, and then he retweeted the  interview that we did excitedly.  He was loving the fact that someone else was on the same page.  Onto his hijinks.  If someone knows the guy and who he is, because I really did not know who he is.  He had a lot of Twitter followers, so he's obviously somebody in the entertainment business.  Help me out with that story.  And I wouldn't care if he made stories up.  I could care less if they're entertaining.  I just didn't like being talked to like an idiot. 
[01:14:30]  Right.  Tucker, if you created some funny stories, great.  Right.  That's great for you.  You're a good writer.  Right.  Yeah, but it was so uncomfortable how much he was just fucking lying to us.  In our humble opinion.  Unfortunately, we have to say that.  But like we're douchey frat boys.  Oh, God.  Where's the tape?  Well, the guy laughed so hard and fell, and the tape fell out.  And they fell on the duty?  Stupid.  And fell on the...  Did he say that?  No, but I'm just...  Oh, okay. 
[01:15:00]  Then the tape was ruined, and I don't have...  What?  What?  What?  It was hard to fuck up a VHS tape.  It really was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Because he said it was VHS, right?  Fell out of the closet, and fell onto the tape, and it broke, and we couldn't fix it.  It was so uncomfortable.  It was such a bad lie.  Right.  Good.  Do that shit with the morning zoo somewhere.  They'll go with it for you.  And the motorcycle hit the side of my car, and the glass broke, and it went into my eye, 
[01:15:30]  and it scratched my eye.  Eye patch situation.  Is that why you were in the patch?  Let's see it.  No.  An hour later.  Well, yeah, I didn't get hurt.  Oh, did we wear him down?  We're good.  Oh, yeah.  We're good.  Fucking...  I watched First 48, and I watched some of those detectives interrogating guys, and I'm  like, they're all right.  Yeah, we're better.  But we fucking are relentless.  E-Rock, have we played Brian...  I don't even know his name.  Brian.  I don't know a lot of the old interns.  Eye patch Brian. 
[01:16:00]  Eye patch Brian.  Have we played that in a while?  No.  We might have to build a whole special around it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then there was Luca.  Remember?  She lived on the second floor.  And I know, E-Rock, we've done this bit.  No, no, no.  He was a mobster.  Oh.  I know we've done this bit a lot, but these are our go-to bits that make us happy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We had an intern that used to come in with, like, black eyes and shit, and next thing  you know, she never came back.  Yeah.  We don't even know if she's alive.  Don't know what happened to her.  Well, don't forget, even more recently, over at XM, you had that intern from Michigan who was writing 
[01:16:30]  his professor.  So why don't we do a Tao special?  Said he met Stallone.  Yeah.  He was on the show.  And he was just weird.  Oh, that guy.  Yeah.  What was his name?  Adam.  I think Adam.  Yeah.  He referred to you guys as, quote, the talent.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He would write his old professor about, quote, the talent.  Right.  He left his email open.  Right.  But how he was meeting people and everything that wasn't happening at all.  Can we build a special?  Yeah.  We did it before, but...  Oh, we have?  Yeah.  We can do it again.  Look at us.  And then Harry, who sent in his own request for his own bits. 
[01:17:00]  Oh, right.  Yeah.  But Travis found the feedback left open in the back.  I forgot about Harry.  I called him a lying sack of cunt.  Of cunt.  Yes.  You didn't like Harry?  I hated Harry.  I hated Harry.  I think he was the one that was stealing the change off your desk.  I think so.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Harry.  And then the other...  We had another intern.  I know we've done this, babe.  It's too fun.  There was a rule that the interns had to fucking stay off of, like, Twitter and shit. 
[01:17:30]  Message boards.  And message boards.  Yeah.  And talking about the show and us and shit like that.  And this one guy was...  He was, like, through DMs, getting through to my girlfriend at the time.  Right.  And DMing her that he was an intern on the show.  Really?  And she told me.  And I'm like, dude, what are you, an asshole?  What the fuck?  I remember you calling him out at K-Rock.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I forgot his name.  I don't remember which one it was.  Just little lying interns.  And then we had the one who we got the lie detector for. 
[01:18:00]  Oh, that was Derek.  Oh, Derek.  What did he do?  He was a weird one.  He said he got mugged, like, 150 times.  Oh, right, right.  I actually follow him on Twitter.  Oh, do you?  He's harmless.  Remember we used to catch him?  He would call this show and Ron and Fez show under various names.  Yeah.  After his internship was over, he had such a distinct voice that he would call this show  and Ron and Fez, but he would use different names.  But everybody knew it was him.  Uh-huh.  Psycho.  Yeah.  My favorite, though.  And he wasn't a psycho, but he might be my number one. 
[01:18:30]  And it's not going to...  No, it's not, David.  I'm sorry.  What?  His English Bob, to this day, makes me laugh.  He just looked British.  He looked British, so we refused to talk to him unless he came in with an English accent.  And his fake British accent was so bad.  Ah, look at that.  Hey, boop.  Here it comes.  Boop.  That's your favorite answer of all time?  Just because of how ridiculous it was.  That was crazy.  He did nothing.  It was just ridiculous that we put him through that. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, my God.  That's right.  More tale facts.  The woman whose pictures were used to depict Lene was revealed to be 23-year-old Diane O'Meara.  Lene.  What do we know about?  What do we know about Diane O'Meara?  Nothing about her on a fact sheet.  She's 23, I believe.  Yep.  She lives in California.  They said she's from a good family, and her pictures were just used.  Her Facebook pictures were used.  Like, she just wakes up and goes, hey, look, I'm on TV. 
[01:19:30]  I'm in this story.  Holy shit.  Wow.  So, she has nothing to do with it.  I don't believe she has anything to do with it.  There's no real connection.  Yeah, no.  Just that they grabbed her fucking picture.  I guess so.  Whoever hoaxed this poor fella.  But he doesn't Skype with his shit.  No, why would you?  It's such bullshit.  Four years.  Why would you fuck her in four years?  It's such bullshit.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, I've been duped before.  It's horrible.  Yeah, there's some catfishing that is happening all around us.  But this guy, like, fucking, it's bullshit.  He's in on it in some way. 
[01:20:00]  I never said I love you without a voice confirmation.  U.S. Weekly claims that alleged mastermind, wow, I, this name is brutal.  You want to try this name?  Alleged mastermind.  Read that name.  Let me see.  Where's the alleged mastermind?  Right at the top there.  The top produces, right?  Yeah.  Whoa. 
[01:20:30]  Raneya.  Raneya.  Zellwey.  Raneya.  Tulasosopo.  Yeah?  It's better than I would have done.  I don't know.  I would have said, uh, Raneya.  Uh.  Tulasosopo.  Uh.  Audition, auditioned for The Voice and had a sob story about being in a car accident.  He told producers that he and his cousins started a Christian band and were involved in a massive car accident while on their way to perform at a youth conference. 
[01:21:00]  You know what?  I'm going to take back, uh, I, I don't think he's gay or I don't know if he's gay.  I think he's just a compulsive fucking liar.  Yeah.  Tale.  I think he's just a compulsive.  Yeah.  It's a pure guess.  He loved the attention.  Yeah.  Maybe he might be gay too, but I think he's just a compulsive liar on top of it.  He wanted to probably portray he's a really good guy.  Maybe, maybe he's not a good guy at all and just built this fake fucking life for himself. 
[01:21:30]  Just one of these fucking creeps who ran.  You ever see these people that they lie for no reason?  He's a great college, uh, football player.  He's a good player.  What's your, what position?  I'm a linebacker.  He was runner up for the Heisman.  We're talking about pretty much the best player in college football this year.  Right.  Some would say.  So will he get a, it's creepy.  Will he get a career, do you think?  That, well, they said, like I said earlier, they said his prospects are dropping, and I quote, like a rock.  He was supposed to go around six. 
[01:22:00]  And now they're saying, oh, we don't know what the fuck's going to happen to this guy.  Imagine you screw up your whole career like that.  Some will take the chance.  I mean, the NFL, I mean, there's a lot of kooks in the NFL.  Yeah, that's true.  Oh, man.  That's crazy.  An unnamed source at Notre Dame claims that the school wanted to go public with this story last week, but Teo's agent did not.  Oh.  So they're all trying to get their stories.  A horse with no name.  Together.  The athletic director is going to, he's going to look like a complete idiot soon. 
[01:22:30]  Yeah.  He was completely supporting Teo yesterday or two days ago.  Well, it's like all the people that supported Lance Armstrong.  I mean, there are people that really supported him vocally and attacked people and verbally, you know what I mean?  And it's embarrassing.  Totally embarrassing.  They just are going to left hung out to dry.  That guy, the guy from the school, it looks like he was such an idiot.  Yeah.  Who?  The athletic guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  He's going to look like a complete fool. 
[01:23:00]  But it seems like those guys are just dumb.  Yeah.  They're not in touch with, like, social networking.  Right, right, right.  Because why wouldn't you just go, well, wait, you had an internet girlfriend, but you never really saw her?  They're just so confused by the internet that they're just thinking, I'm sure they can be bamboos.  I'm going to try to make believe he's an expert.  I don't know.  I want to point to this catfish.  There's a documentary.  Like, he was an expert.  But he had just heard about that right before he went to the podium.  Catfishing or something. 
[01:23:30]  You might want to see the documentary that was made on that.  Yes.  Because they catfished these people.  And then while they're not fishing, they're doing these things online.  Do we have the athletic director?  It might be worth replaying today.  Because I really do think he's going to look like a complete idiot.  Athletic.  You got that, Iraq.  I don't have it in front of me.  I think it might be on the table.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  You're fired.  Donald Trump, fuck you.  You're fired.  What a bunch of fucking pricks.  It's hilarious. 
[01:24:00]  Good job, my deadspin.  Oh, yeah.  Fuck you.  Donald trying to get himself in the story.  Congratulations.  Right.  On your story.  Right.  Breaking the story.  Donald, fuck you.  Right.  Fuck you.  That really is a funny fucking response.  Oh, it's hilarious.  Because they all knew what he was doing.  Hilarious.  He tries to connect himself to a lot of shit out there.  Here's the athletic director, Jimmy, from a couple days ago.  It's just uncomfortable to listen to.  On the morning of December 26th, very early morning, Manti called his coaches to inform 
[01:24:30]  them that while he was in attendance at the ESPN awards show in Orlando, he received a phone  call from a phone call from a number he recognized as having been that he associated with Lene Kikua.  When he answered it, it was a person whose voice sounded like the same voice he had talked 
[01:25:00]  to.  When?  Who told him that she was, in fact, not dead.  I'm not dead.  Manti was very unnerved by that, as you might imagine.  I will let him again talk about that and his reaction to it.  Hall?  But he maintained that secret vis-a-vis the members of the football family until he called 
[01:25:30]  the coaches on the morning of the 26th.  Ah.  They promptly reached out to me to inform me of this shocking piece of this.  My linebacker was a lying sack of shit.  And a retard.  And I arranged to meet Manti upon his return to campus.  Manti.  And did so on the afternoon of the 27th.  His brother, Bo.  What I love about this, this guy is so over his head.  He's so over his head.  He really is so over his head. 
[01:26:00]  Out of his fucking league, too.  He shouldn't be there.  Yes, and their cousin, Skinny.  And his uncle put on your goddamn...  And hog.  So stupid.  This fucking guy.  This guy's full of shite.  He really is full of fucking malarkey.  Another guy that just wants to believe that his star athlete that they are all proud of. 
[01:26:30]  Notre Dame extremely proud of what Tao has done.  He just doesn't want to believe.  They're so willing to sweep so much shit under the carpet in these schools to keep their sacred football players and football program rolling, you know?  The one thing we definitely know is Tao is a kook.  Right.  Either way, he's fucking a weirdo.  And he's a liar.  Obviously a liar.  Maybe not.  Why?  I don't know.  I'm just leaving...  I think he's a liar because he doesn't have... 
[01:27:00]  He's definitely a kook.  He knew about...  Oh, yeah.  There's proof that he lied at this point.  You're right.  And he is a liar.  He's a liar and he's a kook.  That's being dishonest.  Right.  The athletic director continued.  Oh.  And a decision was made to engage an independent investigative firm.  Firm.  To see if they could determine what was at the nature...  Boner.  ...of what increasingly appeared to us to be a sophisticated hoax.  We received a final report from them on January 4th. 
[01:27:30]  I met with Brian and Otilia Teow in Miami on the 5th to share with them the essence of those findings.  We left that meeting with an understanding that they would think about what they had heard. 
[01:28:00]  Engage Manti's future representation, which would be determined later in the week.  In consultation as to how best respond and keep the university fully informed of their intentions.  And work in concert with us.  Work in concert.  When they were ready to communicate the story.  What is he saying?  Nothing.  It was my understanding.  It is my understanding.  That they were on a timetable to release the story themselves next week when today's story broke. 
[01:28:30]  I hear a guy that really wants to believe what he's saying.  You know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He wants to believe what he's saying, but you can hear it.  He's so suspicious.  That's why he's trying to sound very official.  Right.  Like, this is the facts as we know them at this moment.  That's what it communicated to me.  And in his head, he's completely depressed that he was duped by this star athlete.  Yeah.  Completely duped. 
[01:29:00]  Here is where he talks about catfish like he's an expert, but you can tell someone just told him about it right before the press conference.  Yeah, yeah.  Can you say what you've seen or what the investigators saw that would...  Some people, you know, obviously who don't know the whole story are going to question whether Manti was behind the hoax.  Yeah.  What have you seen that would prove that that could not be the truth?  Well, there are several things.  One is I would refer all of you, if you're not already familiar with it, with both the documentary called Catfish. 
[01:29:30]  Catfish.  The MTV show, which is a derivative of that documentary.  And a genuine catfish I have right here.  He doesn't know what it means.  It is a guy that has no idea what the documentary is about.  He pulls a live catfish out of his pocket and it's flopping.  Here is the reason for the hoax.  These things are surprisingly good on Twitter and Facebook. 
[01:30:00]  Very clever little creatures.  They use their whiskers to type.  I got bamboozled from a catfish from Nigeria who once told me I had won $10 million and needed to send them my bank account number.  It's long, but it's true.  And the sort of associated things you'll find online and otherwise about catfish or catfishing.  Catfishing.  It is a scam.  I'm a hunter myself.  It is a scam.  Probably revealing my television watching habits, but it was covered by Dr. Phil extensively recently. 
[01:30:30]  That follows the exact arc of this.  Right.  Arc one.  And it's perpetrated with shocking frequency for me.  Shocking as an older guy who's not as versed in the online world.  Oh, you're not?  And it is.  Well, why don't we look at the transcripts of someone not very versed in the internet?  You said you wanted to have sex.  With a 13-year-old girl.  They brought condoms.  What about this catfish?  And he brings out the fish that was like big pussy in the Sopranos. 
[01:31:00]  And he watches it sing.  It talks.  It sings.  These things can sing.  Why can't you be versed in the internet just because you're older?  What's wrong with these people?  I'm scared of that intertubes.  And it is just as this one, an initial casual engagement, a developing relationship online,  a subsequent trauma, traffic accident, illness, and then a death. 
[01:31:30]  And, you know, as hard as it is for me to get my arms around this, there's apparently some support in doing this.  I said that yesterday.  I was successful.  Sorry.  So that was one.  We sort of found this external guidebook, if you will, or platform for doing this.  Two were the internal consistencies, right?  As we probe, ask questions, wanted to make sure it all lined up with what we knew independently, the facts as we understood them. 
[01:32:00]  And we're very comfortable with the consistency and how it all fit together.  He's not comfortable.  Thirdly, our investigators, through their work, were able to discover online chatter among the perpetrators.  Chatter.  Perpetrators.  This was sort of the ultimate proof of this, the joy they were taking, the sort of casualness with which, among themselves, they were referring to what they had accomplished and what they had done. 
[01:32:30]  Now, where is that?  What is that?  Why wouldn't you bring that to the press conference?  Right.  How about a fucking chatter transcript?  Right.  Yeah.  Let's see the chatter transcript.  Right.  Because that pretty much says, like, oh, look at this.  There's people that are bragging about it.  Sounds good, but let me see it.  Right.  Yeah, where is that?  We saw some chatter.  It said something like, no batter, no batter, swing, swing, no batter, no batter.  Let's hear some chatter out there. 
[01:33:00]  I hated that.  Let's hear some chatter, Brian.  No batter shit.  I would always just move my lips and never chatter.  No chatter.  I would never chatter.  Were you ever the victim of an easy out?  Easy out.  I was never not.  Easy out.  You don't want to be easy out.  As you're walking up to the plate.  That's embarrassing.  Come on in, guys.  And they should wave the outfield way in.  Easy out.  Easy out.  This is what's going on here.  You know, when you get a star athlete like this, it's everything to a university.  Yes.  You know, you go back to the Paterno thing. 
[01:33:30]  It's their bread and butter.  And then, you know, it's deeply depressing when it all starts falling apart in front of  your eyes.  Yeah.  This guy's trying to hang in there, but you could hear it in his voice.  He's like, ah.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll have to go with this because that's what he's saying.  And that's what our investigators found out.  But, of course, the investigators they hired would probably lean toward trying to protect  the image of Notre Dame, don't you think?  Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  So that's the latest on Teo for now. 
[01:34:00]  Does he speak today?  He's got to talk.  He's going to have to at some point or although I still think it's going to be a released  statement through a representative and then he'll go into some kind of rehab because that's  the that's the general fucking direction these things go in.  And then he'll go to rehab for personal issues or something.  And they'll ask the press, hey, you know, please give him his privacy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So you're Tiger Woods thing.  So you think he's just going to come out and admit that he's part of this? 
[01:34:30]  What initially started as a deception against me turned into something I never intended  it to.  Yeah.  I'm going into rehab.  You think you think he might have been duped at first, but then thought this is great for  my image.  I'm going to go with this.  I think he created.  You think he's all in from the beginning?  Yeah, I'm thinking.  Or he got in somewhere along the line and then then kind of just got ahead of him and  he said, fuck it, I'm just going to go with this. 
[01:35:00]  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's weird, man.  It is weird.  I haven't heard him talking about it, though.  Oh, God.  Well, he, we played a lot of his clips yesterday.  It was just really uncomfortable.  Is it obvious that he's lying or only in hindsight?  He's pretty good at it.  But that's why I think he picked, you know, his grandma dying and the girlfriend dying.  So it masked, you know, the bullshit because there's real sadness because he lost his  grandma.  Yeah.  So he was able to cover up, you know, it's like, wow, his girlfriend died and he doesn't 
[01:35:30]  look like a guy that is grieving.  But the sadness you see in his eyes is because he lost his grandma.  That's grandma's sadness.  It's grandma's sadness.  That's the grandma's sadness.  He's got grandma's sadness.  What a bum.  That ain't girlfriend's sadness.  He's a bum.  He's, there's some, I don't, it's.  What a creep, right?  What a fucking creep.  A dot loyig.  God, that's psycho too.  Oh my God.  What a pesterer he is.  Do you see how he pesters that girl online?  I know.  Yeah.  And I started, I started tweeting her.  It was hilarious. 
[01:36:00]  I just couldn't, I had to tap out for a while.  Who are you talking about?  The Bobo.  Bobo's girlfriend.  The Bobo.  The Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah.  I just want to speak, say sorry about the.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Do you have a statement to make, Bobo?  Are you being, are you the victim of some catfishing yourself?  Yes.  Is there catfishing going on?  Or is this a real relationship?  Yeah.  Comment, Bobo?  No, I'm not the victim of anything.  All right.  So you really do have a girl that's, just for the people that don't know, you really have 
[01:36:30]  a girl that's interested in you from what?  Across the pond?  Yep.  What's her name?  Katie.  All right.  So you're convinced that this Katie broad really, really digs you.  And there's no hoax going on?  There's no catfishing going on?  No.  Bobo, could you?  She wouldn't be afraid to admit it if she did.  All right.  So why don't you, how do you prove that it's not all bullshit?  For one thing, I'm sure she'll tweet you guys right now.  Bobo, could you talk like you speak to fucking Sam on the after show? 
[01:37:00]  You know, up and alert and with volume in your voice.  Hey, Bobo.  Did you see Argo?  Well, I...  Can you believe that it won the award?  I didn't even see that movie, right?  He doesn't do it.  No, no, no.  He won't do it.  Holy shit.  Holy shit.  I got turned off by that movie when I found out the whole thing, the whole thing was even  not even half of what really happened.  No, that's what we said yesterday. 
[01:37:30]  Yeah, I know.  But when I heard about that...  All right.  Hey, Bobo.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Your opinion was different, so he adopted yours.  Yes, of course.  Bobo blamed me yesterday.  Here's what happened in yesterday's storyline.  But I'm confused.  What is going on?  Well, there's this girl.  That's totally...  Katie.  Bobo and I, she's coming in to see me this weekend.  Oh, nice.  Oh, nice.  Cool.  She lives in England.  She's coming to see Jimmy this weekend, hang out with him.  But Bobo apparently is in some type of relationship with her, and he hounds her relentlessly 
[01:38:00]  all day long on Twitter.  Uh, Katie, where are you?  Katie, please answer me.  Answer me.  I'm crying.  Bobo, why do you do this?  I don't want to ruin everyone's fun, but does he have any awareness that it's all bullshit?  I don't know.  He doesn't think it's bullshit.  Jesus Christ.  Bobo.  Bobo.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, why do you hound her so much?  I don't know.  I think it takes a long time for her to respond.  Bobo, tell the truth.  It's because you're in love. 
[01:38:30]  Are you in love?  Yeah.  Oh, he's in love.  Well, now, are you Facebook friends with her?  No.  Are you Jim?  Well, yeah, of course we talk.  Oh.  You don't talk.  You only talk on Twitter.  Bobo?  Yeah.  Oh, my God, Jimmy.  Jimmy's getting so mad.  Bobo, you've got to answer these questions.  Irritating.  You call him with nothing.  Why are you calling?  Why are you calling? 
[01:39:00]  Why are you calling?  Right.  I was just calling in to say we're sorry for Anthony over being upset.  It's not upset.  Anthony's not upset.  He doesn't give a fuck.  Bobo got very mad at me yesterday.  Why?  He thought I said something that forced Bobo to relentlessly tweet Katie, who then told  Bobo to shut up, and then Bobo blamed me for getting in their relationship and fucking  it up.  Well, you know, she tells you that a lot of times when we Facebook chat, that you just 
[01:39:30]  pester her too much.  And then, like, you know, she said she's looking forward to a quiet weekend here in  New York without any pestering.  Yeah, but the problem is she ain't going to New York without seeing me.  Oh.  Well, she's coming.  She lands tomorrow morning.  So she's seeing you this weekend, Bobo?  Oh, that's the thing.  She wouldn't do that.  She wouldn't do that to be behind my back.  Oh, boy.  But you've never...  You've never met her.  You've never met her.  This is just like Manti.  That's why I guess... 
[01:40:00]  Manti Bobo.  It's a good storyline for our show, because this is our tale.  Yes.  We have a catfish...  She doesn't exist in the way you think.  As a matter of fact, I've been trying to get her to call with the show forever.  As a matter of fact, Opie, how do you respond to that?  She's in England.  Yeah.  It's a different time zone.  Right.  Bobo, have you exchanged romantic messages with her? 
[01:40:30]  Thank you.  Oh.  Yeah.  My God.  Bobo.  What I can tell you is that she is not...  I cannot speak to her.  I cannot tweet her until the next time she tweets me.  Why?  Oh, boy.  Oh, she got so upset over this whole thing when I was getting upset at her.  Does that sound like a mutual, loving relationship that she says, don't tweet me until I tweet you?  And then you tweet anyway, and you keep tweeting like, are you there? 
[01:41:00]  Tweet me back.  Where are you?  I mean, she's awake.  Could you tweet me?  She just tweeted 15 minutes ago.  Oh.  Yeah, I was Facebook messaging with her before.  Oh, okay.  So she is still talking to people online.  Yeah.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Bobo, comment?  Bobo?  What do you got, Bobo?  Comment?  Oh, I'm sure she won't go to New York without feed me, all right?  Right.  If she does, you have no idea how upset I'd be at her if she went. 
[01:41:30]  Oh, man.  She would have been like 10.  Would you strangle her?  No.  Would you choke her?  Yeah.  No.  Would you rape her body in a ditch?  Would you kill her, Bobo?  Comment?  No?  Then how upset would you be with her?  What do you like most about her, Bobo?  Describe what you like most about Kitty.  Does she have a big clit?  I don't even get those photos, all right?  First of all, I know she told me that you were making all this stuff up. 
[01:42:00]  What stuff?  No, anything about her going to see you, Jimmy.  What does it say right here, Sam?  Is this not her offering me tea?  Wow.  Oh, man.  There's a Facebook message from Katie.  Yeah.  And it says, can I make you a cup of tea?  I made a cup of tea.  You want one?  And I got it when I landed.  Because I don't always answer it back.  Sometimes I'm busy talking to other chicks.  Uh-huh. 
[01:42:30]  And I just wrote, I'm drinking coffee.  That's it.  Ah.  I'll talk to her when I get the time.  That was this morning?  Bobo, comment?  Yeah, I was talking to her on the plane.  Bobo, comment?  Yeah.  Also, I do know there's a lot of fake.  There's a lot of, there is a lot of fake furs on Twitter.  Are you getting catfished, Jim?  No, this is really her.  Oh.  Okay, great.  Good for you.  No, this is.  Bobo.  Oh, it's not?  Okay, hold on one second, Bobo.  I can't believe I'm trying to prove this blithering idiot wrong. 
[01:43:00]  Hold on.  Let me see.  Now, Sam, are you going to tell me that that's...  Bobo?  Yeah.  I mean, that's absolutely her.  That's her.  There's pictures of her.  She's got wrestling photos up on her page.  She's a big wrestling fan, Bobo.  Big wrestling fan, so...  Yeah.  Yeah, that's her.  These are all her, uh...  Yeah, no, that's her actual page.  That's not a catfish page.  Bobo?  That's her. 
[01:43:30]  Bobo?  Comment?  That's cool, Jim.  You made a friend.  Yeah.  Made more than a friend.  Oh, really?  Uh-huh.  That's really cool, then.  A little overseas relationship there.  Yeah, why not?  Wow, that's pretty cool.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  Bobo?  Yeah.  All right.  Whatever, right?  She only talks to me on Twitter.  She...  She exists for that reason.  I don't know.  I guess maybe because it's enough I talk to her on Twitter.  Because you don't stop.  Yes.  Like, you don't listen when your friends try to tell you something.  You don't listen when she tries to tell you. 
[01:44:00]  You just...  You're relentless, and you don't care that you're bugging her.  I've even gone as far as being quiet on Twitter.  No, you're not.  That's what you should do.  But you're not.  You're quiet for like 10 minutes, and then you let out like 15 more tweets about, where  are you?  Talk to me.  I'm very upset.  When are you going to get back to me?  Get back to me.  Where have you been?  Where are you?  It's like...  Relentless. 
[01:44:30]  Looking at her Facebook page to see recent activity.  Yeah.  Katie is now friends with Jim Norton.  Yeah.  What do you think?  Bobo?  Why aren't you Facebook friends with your girlfriend?  All right.  It's already...  It's already enough.  I talked to her on Twitter.  It's not that intimate, Twitter.  How do you...  How are you two boyfriend and girlfriend, and in love, if you've never even seen each  other or talked to each other in person? 
[01:45:00]  You've never talked to her on the phone?  No.  I mean, she says enough on Twitter, and plus all the expenses and stuff.  So how do you fall in love with a girl when you don't even talk to her, Bobo?  How do you know what her voice sounds like?  Yeah.  What if it's like this?  Oh, Bobo!  How are you?  Oh, I love you, Bobo!  Well, I wouldn't matter to... 
[01:45:30]  That wouldn't matter to be.  That wouldn't matter to be.  It's just endless blathering tweets to her.  What do you like about her the most, looks-wise, Bobo?  I just think she looks great.  What do you like about her?  That fiery red hair?  Yeah.  Those big eyes?  Her ass and pussy?  Yeah.  It's just some reason, something about that hair and that face.  Yeah, you want to see it over her back, right?  While you're just fucking bagged deep in her pussy, right? 
[01:46:00]  It's just a pre-cum all over her, like an explosion at the crazy glue factory.  I think of that when I look at her.  It comes to pre.  I think of what it's going to be like to hold those British hips and give her a good rogering.  A good rogering?  We're going to shag.  Are you planning on doing that?  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, I'm going to give her a good rogering.  Yes.  Tell her I'm feeling randy.  Get down there and smell my oniony crumpets. 
[01:46:30]  Are you going to stick your twigs and berries in her mouth?  You bet I am.  I'm going to shoot some fucking English breakfast tea all over her back.  Would you like some cream with that?  I'm going to put my dick between her giant fucking Ferris wheels.  I got to tell you something.  Make her some special tartar sauce for those fish sticks.  That's right.  I'm going to blitzkrieg her asshole up my dick.  Bobo, if they were talking about my woman like this, I'd be fucking pissed. 
[01:47:00]  Bobo?  There's no way I would let Jim talk about my woman like that.  I'd be pissed right.  I made a degree, but not to get...  Why don't you stand up to Jim?  He just said he was going to come all over her back.  Yeah, what the fuck's wrong with you?  Stand up to him.  Be a man.  Defend your woman.  First of all, Jimmy.  I think, oh, first of all, you...  First of all, she would rather go with me because she knows I wouldn't leave her. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, Jim's going to fuck her.  So she would kind of want you to...  You know, a lot of things wouldn't leave her.  Yeah.  Leukemia.  Leukemia wouldn't leave her.  Exactly.  Rickets.  The scurvy.  They have that over there.  I'm not saying I'm going to date her forever.  Yeah, Bobo.  I'm just saying I'm going to hold her pale hips and give her a rogering.  Yeah.  A rogering.  I love a rogering.  I'm going to give her a jolly good...  I'm going to give her a very... 
[01:48:00]  An aggressive buggering.  I'm going to grab her freckled ass cheeks and open up her bong and give her a savage buggering.  Bobo, you won't leave her, but you'll allow her to be disrespected like that?  Yeah.  Or fucking...  Or angrily buggered.  They're fucking her face in a...  I'm not even going to put her up at a good hotel. 
[01:48:30]  I'm going to stick her in one of those bed bug hotels.  Give her a good fucking rogering and send her back to a room to get bitten.  Yeah.  Send her the carter.  Yeah, make sure you leave your fucking suitcase on the bed while you're over my place.  Bobo, you're going to let Jimmy get away with this?  He's definitely disrespecting your girl.  She's going to hear this and be thinking,  Oh, why didn't Bobo defend me?  He made me sound like a fucking...  A whore.  If Jim said he was going to bugger Jess, you know what I'd say? 
[01:49:00]  Oh, man.  I'd go like this.  Fuck you, man.  That would be harsh.  Well, Jimmy, you're just going to be upset at you.  All right, Jimmy?  Right now, it's freaking making me freaking getting annoyed to even look at that freaking poster.  That Jim Doran poster in my room.  He's so annoyed at you that he can't look at the poster of you that's in his room.  Why be mad at me, Bobo?  Oh, my God.  When you rip it up, at least?  I like that. 
[01:49:30]  At least take it off the wall.  Really?  You don't need to take my poster down.  Fucking God.  I'm removing that frame.  It's somewhere in a...  Frame.  It's framed.  In the closet.  Do not remove that frame.  I want you to look at that and just think that I'm treating your girl well.  Yeah.  I'm not going to hurt her.  It's going to be a good hurt.  Bobo, think about it this way, Bobo.  You might love her, and she might even have feelings for you, but you really can't give  her the rogering that a professional like Jim Norton can. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  So, just, you're okay with him, you know, having sex with her, and then you having, like,  the relationship part, right?  Yeah, you can hold her hand after I give her an anger-driven rogering.  That's okay, right?  No, I mean, even if she did, she'd feel freaking bad, because she'd know how upset I'd be.  I bet Jim wouldn't make her feel bad.  No, Jim would make her feel good, right?  I'd make her forget you were alive for a good two minutes.  You can't, because, Bobo, face it, you're a virgin. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah.  You can't go in there and think you're going to be able to, you know, rock her world or  something.  She likes dirty talk, Bobo.  You don't talk dirty to her.  Oh, Bobo.  That's why she loses interest, because when I talk to her, I always tell her what I'm going  to do to her sexually.  But you don't tell her any of that stuff.  If you want my advice, fucking man up and start telling her what you're going to do  to her sexually.  Yeah, Bobo.  How about that?  Bobo, let's give you some advice here, okay?  And we're helping you out here.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. 
[01:51:00]  We're helping you out here.  When you tweet her later on...  How about right now?  What are you waiting for?  Yeah, tweet right now.  Tweet her right now, and tweet dirty talk, because she likes that shit.  All right.  All right.  Tweet some dirty stuff.  What are you going to tweet?  I haven't decided yet, but...  No, you got to...  Give us a little bit of what you're going to tweet.  How about you just tweet it, and I'll read it.  Stop playing games.  Yeah.  Tweet it, and we'll read it, and she'll read it, and I think it'll be a lot better, because  you know, you're fucking... 
[01:51:30]  You got to man up and get a little kinky with her, you know?  She likes dirty talk.  I told her I was going to fucking grab her pale hips.  I said, I'm going to grab your Casper-y hips, and I'm going to shove it right into your  undoubtedly hairy fucking box.  I'll probably face him, like, admit it.  You want the memories of me taking it up to shitter when you visit this country.  Yeah, but don't tell me what you're going to say.  Just write it to her. 
[01:52:00]  Just write it.  That's pretty good, though.  She likes dirty talk.  That's what girls like.  She's a dirty girl.  Yeah, she's a dirty girl.  Bobo, face it, and tweet that, and then tweet, like, five more that are all different, but  all, like, one worse than the other and more dirty, because she likes that.  A lot of girls like to be called skanks.  Yeah, yeah.  Whores.  Yeah.  You know, just call her...  A hussy.  Yeah, shit like that, Bobo.  Yeah.  It's going to come in her eye.  You got it?  She digs that. 
[01:52:30]  All right.  Well, I'll do that, and you'll probably hear an update about it.  All right.  Do it now.  What are you waiting for?  You're playing games.  Well, as soon as I hang up in this call.  All right.  Well, we'll hang up with you now, and then we'll update the country on what you're doing.  We're going to check the Twitter feed in a while, and if you don't do this, Jim's going  to fucking steal your girlfriend away from you, so you better man up.  Yeah.  I'm going to fuck her right after she gets off the plane when her asshole still stinks.  Fucking flight from England to New York.  Yeah, when she has across the pond ass. 
[01:53:00]  And coach, all sweaty.  Exactly.  I don't fly them first until they prove they can fuck.  Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for the lack of air conditioning on this flight.  The air conditioners seem to have broke, and we'll make sure you're comfortable as quickly  as possible.  A lot of your buttocks may have stuck to your underwear like fruit roll-ups.  We apologize to you and any mates you meet right after the flight.  The duration of the flight should be around the time it takes for your sweat from the back 
[01:53:30]  of your neck to reach your ass crack.  There'll be plenty of it.  Why am I Australian again?  I don't know.  I can't do a fucking bloody well English accent.  It always turns into Australian.  Yeah, so you gotta talk aggressive and dirty.  That's what she digs.  You're fucking all mushy.  Dude, I wanna hold your hand.  I love you.  I'll stop tweeting.  What kind of guy takes advice like that?  It's terrible.  You gotta man up.  Man up.  Be a little more aggressive with your tweets. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  And be dirty.  You hear us?  We're giving you advice.  We're your pals.  Picture her in front of you, and you're just mashing your hands together idiotically while  you leak pre-cum.  That's what you should be doing.  Stop making noises.  Noises.  What's he doing?  He just hung up.  Oh, okay.  Good.  There we go.  All right.  Well, we'll read his tweets and see how that goes.  Poor bastard. 
[01:54:30]  Jimmy is disgusted.  He was literally blaming me for her getting mad at him because I said something that made  Bobo think that he should tweet her more, so she got mad at him for tweeting him more.  So he's like, you made me tweet her more, so in order to make up the relationship, if  she breaks up with me, you have to get me all-star tickets.  Like, what?  What does that even mean?  It's exhausting.  It is exhausting.  He's always willing to settle.  I know you bashed my girlfriend's brains in. 
[01:55:00]  I want to go see the Mets.  Yeah.  That's all it takes.  All right.  I want a pinwheel and one of those big lollipops.  Right.  All right.  We got Dominic Monaghan coming in next.  A little later.  Mr. Monaghan?  Josh Gad, who was a big star in Book of Mormon and is now on TV.  Very good actor.  TV.  Doing what?  1,600.  1,600.  1,600.  Yeah.  Good guy, too, man.  We'll break here.  This is the Opie and Anthony Channel on Sirius XM.  Wow.  Our new intern has a black eye. 
[01:55:30]  I can't take the intern with a black eye.  What is it?  What is it?  Why do you have a black eye, man?  I got elbowed in the face.  It was a black eye.  People do the craziest things to get on our radio show.  This is amazing.  This is our new intern.  Sidney.  What's your name?  Sidney.  Sidney.  Yes.  Okay.  And she's walking around.  All of a sudden, I'm looking going, holy S, she's got a black eye.  You know, there's programs where you can go and get a room away from this abusive person.  What happened?  I got elbowed in the face. 
[01:56:00]  Elbowed in the face?  Yeah.  I'm short, so I'm elbowed.  How did that happen?  I was working.  I'm a waitress.  You're a waitress?  Like cocktail waitress or food?  Yeah.  It's like bar or restaurant.  Bar, restaurant thing?  And you turn around and somebody's elbow was there?  It was really crowded and I was trying to get through and pop.  What did you do?  Did you go down?  No.  No?  You kind of like a wolf.  It's not stars, but I kept walking.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  Damn.  A chick with a black eye is just like, so hot.  Wow.  No, I mean, it's one of those things where it's like you instantly think that a guy just 
[01:56:30]  punched you in the face, you know?  No.  But you're saying that's not what happened.  Thank you.  So what are you going to say the next one is?  A door?  Yeah, that's what they told me to say, actually.  A door?  Walked into a door.  And then if it's the lip, you can say it's something else.  Someday we'll have to have an intervention.  All right.  Yeah, yeah.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Sydney, our new intern with the black eye.  Anthony, a lot of people don't believe our new intern story.  Sydney.  Yeah, I know.  She's got a black eye.  I got an email here. 
[01:57:00]  Sydney's boyfriend checking in.  Tell that bitch to bring home my can of chunky soup or she'll get more of what she got last  night.  Here's our new name.  Don't let her lie to you guys.  Her name is Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca. 
[01:57:30]  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  Luca.  What it was  I think it's cause  I'm clumsy 
[01:58:00]  I try not to talk to them  Maybe it's because  I'm crazy  I try not to act too proud  Shut up!  Shut up!  Hey man, I'm not her boyfriend  After that  You don't ask why  You just don't  Virgin  Just don't argue  Just don't argue 
[01:58:30]  No!  No!  Ha ha ha ha ha ha  Ha ha ha ha ha  What to do  If you ask us  I'll say  Natural feels 
[01:59:00]  Missed anything  Because I'd rather  To be alone  Nothing broken  Nothing wrong  Just don't ask  How I am  Just don't ask me  How I am  You're stupid  Just don't ask me  How I am  Stupid friggin twat  My name is  Moron!  I live on the second floor  Stupid friggin twat  I live upstairs 
[01:59:30]  You're a friggin moron  Yes I think  You've seen me before  You hear something  That it takes  You're stupid  Some kind  Troubles  Just don't ask me  Just don't ask me  Luka  Just don't ask me  Damn  We're gonna hit the show  Again  I've heard that

[02:00:30]  Wow.  Oh, my God.  All right, Luca.  See how quick the nicknames come in?  Oh, yeah.  Right.  And you come in with a black eye, and your name is now Luca.  I can live.  Yes, right on the second floor.  It rubs the lotion on its skin, or else it gets the hose again. 
[02:01:00]  Here she goes.  Luca, our new intern.  Luca, everyone.  The black eye.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  So there it was, the Luca bit from, I don't know, 10, 11 years ago.  Right.  And then that intern just disappeared and never came back.  Weren't able to find her.  I think she came back a couple times after that bit, but then just disappeared. 
[02:01:30]  Yeah.  We'd love to know whatever happened to her.  Or she's still out there somewhere.  I bet she's fine.  Get a little update on her.  Just living her life out there somewhere.  Yeah.  No.  I guess Bobo's tweeting the Katie Brood.  Yeah, but then he apologizes.  He's a worm.  Oh, my God.  What did he tweet?  I'm sorry.  He wanted to do something banger or something in front of my poster.  Yeah, that was his tweet.  Oh.  But then he's tattling on me.  Oh, man.  He's trying to get me and my girl in trouble.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy. 
[02:02:00]  What happened?  He's saying, I want you to have the memory of taking up the shiter.  Stupid.  He smelled shitter wrong.  I want you.  I want you.  Where's our guest?  Dominic Monaghan.  Yeah, where is he?  Running a little late?  Probably.  They all run late.  Yeah.  Do you know, I was at the gun store yesterday.  Ooh.  And I was purchasing a new weapon, one that would be compliant for me to carry here in 
[02:02:30]  New York City with the new magazine restrictions.  And through my journeys at the precinct, which the normal line usually takes about 15 minutes,  three-hour wait to get the forms you need to buy a gun.  Because you've got to pick up forms every time you want to buy a new gun.  Right.  You've got to pick up a certain form.  That was before all the new ones.  Pay them 10 bucks.  Yeah, yeah.  This is old stuff. 
[02:03:00]  But now people are in there, like, there's a huge line of people getting their pistol license.  Like, everything from first walking in and going, how do I get a gun, to people that have  had their license for years, renewing, and people getting purchase forms to buy weapons  with.  And through my journeys yesterday, I did hear tell something from a very well-placed source.  That this legislation that went in place for New York, that bans assault weapons and has  a seven-round limit on magazines, there's some amendments being drawn up. 
[02:03:30]  Because this was written so quickly and so haphazardly and slid through at midnight while  everybody was sleeping that there is some type of precedent to appeal this and to, you know,  take it to court.  So there's amendments being drawn up right now, one of which is a little oversight they had.  So the small oversight, law enforcement was not exempt from all of these rules. 
[02:04:00]  It's not in the fucking rules.  So if you're a cop, and let's say you're on the job, on the job you're okay.  So let's say you got your 9mm, carries 15 rounds.  Now, all of a sudden you're off work, you're driving home.  You are now a felon.  You're now a felon.  That was obviously a fuck-up, though.  I would assume, but again, it's because they rushed this through so quickly.  Right.  To fucking sneak it in.  Ah, you think the government's sneaky?  No, yeah, well, maybe.  Sneaky Pete's.  You think they're sneaky Pete's?  Well, maybe a little. 
[02:04:30]  So the first amendment they're working on is the law enforcement exemption.  So they'll be exempt.  They'll be able to carry whatever they want.  The second exemption I'm hearing about, amendment that they're going to do, or they're writing up,  anyway, is 10 rounds instead of 7.  So they could kick it right back up to 10 rounds and 10-round magazines, which would be a lot easier for people instead of the 7-round shit.  So that's what my well-placed sources are telling me, that we might get away from this 7-round thing, and it could be 10 rounds. 
[02:05:00]  There you go.  And by the way, I picked up a Glock 36.  Pew, pew!  Which holds a magazine of 6, one in the chamber, for a total of 7 rounds of .45-caliber ammunition.  And, yeah, there we go.  I've got to take it to the range.  Plah, plah.  And I'll carry 10 fucking magazines on me, by the way.  What are you going to read?  So I have hundreds of bullets.  Oh, so you're allowed to have an unlimited amount of magazines? 
[02:05:30]  Yes, that's another thing.  You're only allowed 7 right now, or 10, if they pass these things.  And then you can carry as many mags as you want.  And how, I really don't know, so how quickly could you switch mags out?  Seconds.  Oh, God, that's so stupid.  If that, I could change a mag in fucking, like, probably two seconds.  So it's just a slight hassle.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  It does nothing.  Of course it does nothing.  All right.  That's your gun legislation update for the day. 
[02:06:00]  I could change a mag in like a fucking half second.  You can?  Fuck, yeah.  Pretty good.  What kind of gun?  Fuck them.  45.  Yeah, what make, though?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Fuck a 45 Deagle.  Desert Eagle.  Oh, you got a Deagle.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You make them a, you know, 44.  Fuck, yeah.  I got a better one.  If you said Magnum.  50 cal.  Yeah, whatever. 
[02:06:30]  Yeah.  Sounds good.  Shoot them all.  I'm happy for you.  Speaking of guns, front page of CNN.  Bloomberg.  Fewer guns means fewer murders.  No, it doesn't.  Never has.  What about Chicago?  Well, that's...  And New York.  New York's got some of the best gun legislation.  I think they asked him about Chicago, and he was basically saying, you know, they need  a better fucking police up there.  Oh, is that it?  Mm-hmm.  Right.  Good old Bloomy.  Bloomberg.  Yeah.  He's an idiot.  He's an idiot.  Ah, he's just trying to do the right thing. 
[02:07:00]  Aw.  For his people.  That's nice.  Well, we can't really start anything, because Dominic's going to be here any moment, right?  Yes.  Is he signing in?  Do we know?  I don't know.  Roland said less than five minutes.  We had a stutterer on American Idol.  Oh, right.  We could do that.  I kind of want to hear that.  You do?  Yeah.  Because I don't watch American Idol.  I haven't for years and years and years, and I hear it's just dropping off like fucking  crazy.  Rating's down 19%.  Terrible.  From last year.  19%.  And I think last year was down from the year before that. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  There's so many shows now.  So they're kind of in a bit of trouble.  They thought Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj would get something done, but so far, not so good.  And this clip is fucking going viral today.  As it says here, they were going for their Susan Boyle moment.  Oh.  And it didn't work.  You know, where you don't expect them to be a great singer.  The guy has a horrendous stutter.  It's really bad.  Oh.  And listen how out of touch Mariah Carey is here. 
[02:08:00]  If we get this to work.  Oh, boy.  It's stuck.  What happened?  It's stuck.  Oh, no.  It's not working.  Oh, man.  Wow.  This thing is seeing better days.  There it is.  Yeah.  You think?  It's queuing up.  Queue.  Dominic on his way?  You haven't here yet.  Oh.  Oh, shit. 
[02:08:30]  That don't make no sense.  Maybe he's caught in Bortor.  We're talking about the stutterer.  The stutterer.  Maybe he went back to the eye one.  And Mariah Carey just out of touch.  Completely.  The show is horrible.  If it's been with us, stuttering is really hard.  Because, um, like, the things that normal people would think would be so, so, so, so, 
[02:09:00]  ways is easy to become so hard for me.  Why are they doing this?  Thank you.  Why are they doing this?  Because they're good people?  No.  It's another fucking sideshow shit.  Nobody wants to admit this.  They don't just randomly bring these people in.  They're pre-audition.  Right.  America loves freak shows.  Yeah.  But you can't just go, hey, give me your 50 cents and see the freak behind the fucking  curtain.  You have to make believe there's a real story behind the freaks now.  Right.  And I'm sorry I'm calling him a freak, but that's the reason why he's on this show. 
[02:09:30]  The only reason.  Because they're deeming him a freak.  Like, look what you get to see today.  Remember that guy?  I don't think...  Hung?  What was his name?  William Hung.  William Hung?  Remember him?  He was the freak that year.  I don't think stutterers are freaks, but this is how they're doing it.  Stutterers must be smote.  Smote.  They must be smitten.  But they throw a little story behind it, a little of that music, and then everyone feels 
[02:10:00]  a little better that they're looking at something a little uncomfortable.  Freakish.  It's fucked up.  It's hard for me.  We don't know where my stuttering came from, because, you know, it's just something that  goes on.  Hey, come on in.  Dominic, what's up?  Take a seat.  How you guys doing?  Nice.  Dominic Monahan in studio.  Very good.  Who's the guy crying in the bow tie? 
[02:10:30]  That's some guy from American Idol, I guess.  Is that the guy that was stuttering or something?  Yeah, man.  I read your book.  Oh, did you?  Yeah.  Oh, thank you.  You know who gave me your book?  What?  Viggo Mortensen gave me your book.  Did he?  Viggo?  Loved it.  Oh, wow.  Cool.  Thanks.  Right on.  I'm going to go check this out.  This is funny.  Look how happy Jimmy is.  Hold on.  Happy endings?  Was that what it was called?  That's it.  Thank you.  Wow.  So Viggo recommended Jimmy's book to you.  Yeah, yeah.  See, and you were just fucking pissing and moaning like a little fairy the other day 
[02:11:00]  about Kevin Bacon not recognizing you.  Blow me, Jimmy Norton.  I only care because he was at one of my shows at the Improv.  Otherwise, I wouldn't.  These guys weren't at all, and they got your book and know who the fuck you are.  Yeah, and it was good.  It was funny as hell.  Holy shit.  Jimmy's very happy.  I don't want to hear another word out of you, Jimmy.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  Kevin Bacon, Kevin Schmacon.  I threw you into the bus there.  I appreciate it.  These guys are fucking huge.  Him and Viggo, fucking egg.  That was a very dirty, true book.  Giant trilogy of the fucking century. 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  It's amazing.  I'm reading books about, you know, guys on massage tables.  Massage tables.  Massage tables.  Massage tables.  Sorry, I'm eating my breakfast right now.  But we do it all the time.  I did that awful thing this morning.  I set my alarm for 7.15, and then when it went off, I was like, oh, I need to sleep.  And then I set up for 7.30, and then 7.45, and then 7.50.  Because I set it so that I could have breakfast, and then eventually I was like, I don't need  breakfast.  I need to sleep.  Yeah, yeah.  Believe me.  We know how this whole morning thing works.  What time do you guys normally get up? 
[02:12:00]  It stinks.  Oh, I've got like 4.45.  Oh, fuck that.  It's terrible.  No.  What do you usually, what time do you usually get up?  You know, when I was younger, I was an amazing sleeper.  My mom used to come back from work around about 5 o'clock at night, and I would set my alarm  for 4.30 in the afternoon, sleep all the way through, jump in the shower.  My mom would get in at 5, and I would say, hi, I've just been out and had a shower, and  I've been out all day, and I'd come downstairs.  They'd have dinner, and that would be my first meal.  And you would just be asleep the whole day. 
[02:12:30]  I was an outrageous sleeper.  But nowadays, if I don't set an alarm, probably like 8.45, 9, I'll wake up, you know?  But there's got to be times you're working where they tell you, oh, you've got to be  on set at like fucking 3 in the morning.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, we would get crazy calls on Lord of the Rings.  The Hobbits were usually in first and out last, because we had feet and ears and hair  to do every day.  So an average call for the Hobbits was probably like 5.25, but I had like a 4.20 call one  day.  How long did it take to get to makeup? 
[02:13:00]  Makeup was like probably an hour and a half.  It started out like two and a half hours, got to about an hour and a half.  That's not bad.  We've heard horror stories where you're sitting there for five, six hours for some of this  shit.  We would get in our ears first, then our hair, then you'd stand up for an hour while they  put your feet in.  Real.  And I remember meeting Christopher Lee for the first time.  I was driving in a car in Wellington to the studio, and it was like 5 in the morning,  and Christopher Lee was saying, I have never been woken up this year in my life. 
[02:13:30]  And I was just sat there going, oh my God.  It's Christopher Lee.  Christopher Lee talking to me about work and stuff.  I forgot who it was.  It might have been when Elijah was in here, and he was talking about the fact that you  would look at what you were shooting that day, and if the feet weren't being shot, you were  very happy.  Yeah, we were stoked, because it meant that you got an hour later call, and it meant that  when you rapped, you rapped.  Because when we rapped on the film, everyone left and went to the, you know, it was all  young men working on the film, or went to the bar and hung out and everything and stuff. 
[02:14:00]  And we would have to rap out, and it would take us like 45 minutes.  They'd gently peel our feet off.  Right, because they got to use it again.  No, no, they wouldn't use it again.  Oh, they wouldn't use it again.  So why would they gently?  They'd bin it, but they didn't leave any evidence of the making process, because these feet were  kind of unique, you know?  Oh, shit.  So they would take them off, then they'd shred them, then they'd take off your ears, which  they would use again, then they'd take off your wig, which they would use again, then  you'd have to clean up all your face, because I'd shave twice a day.  I have really horrible issues with shaving, and I'd shave twice a day. 
[02:14:30]  So I'd come in in the morning, shave in the morning, and then at lunchtime, they'd bring  me back, and I'd shave through, like...  You would get enough whiskers by lunchtime where you're like...  You didn't look like that little, innocent, hobbit-y face.  Just looking like an old, drunk hobbit.  A hobbit had had a few too many beers at lunchtime.  But I would...  So I'd have to shave over, like, blood and sweat and makeup, and my skin went mental on  that.  Yeah, that's probably not a good thing.  I've seen pictures of me, like, when I'm doing Lord of the Rings, and I can tell my skin's 
[02:15:00]  having a really tough time.  Really?  Isn't there, like, a thing you could use that you...  Like, I think black people use it when they get those shaving bumps.  It's almost like a putty that you can roll over and take it off without a razor?  Yeah, we tried everything, and I just couldn't do it.  But we learned a lot on those films, you know?  I bet.  When we started rehearsing, they did, like, a full-on makeup check of all of us.  Like, sat us down, put the makeup on us, and worked out, like, what was working for  us, what wasn't working for us.  And the head makeup artist came over to me. 
[02:15:30]  I was only 21 at the time.  And she said, you need to start drinking water.  Wow, really?  Because I wasn't drinking water.  As a rule, I wasn't drinking water, like, throughout the day.  I was a young kid.  I was drinking beer and stuff.  Yeah.  She was like, you need to start drinking water, because what's happening is the makeup's  gone into your skin, and it's just disappeared, because you're so dehydrated.  Oh, wow.  So I then got educated in that few years about all these different health things about drinking  water.  We all learned to surf out there, and we were horse riding, and sword fighting, and, you 
[02:16:00]  know, jumping out of airplanes, and bungee jumping.  Wouldn't you have to take a leak, though, like, in kind of an opportune time, if you were drinking  a lot of water?  Yeah, we did that.  And also, I wore a fat suit, which was kind of like a leotard, like a gymnastic ladies  leotard, you know?  It was like the old-fashioned leotard thing, and that was just awful, because you'd run around  in it, and it would stink, and you'd wear it every day, and at the end of the day, I'd  have to take it off, and all the boys were like, oh, what are you doing?  Because I'd take off my shirt in the car, and they'd be like, oh, what are you doing? 
[02:16:30]  You stink, you stink, because Mary, in the first film, was a little portly.  In the books, he's described as a hobbit that enjoys himself, you know, likes an extra  beer or two, likes to eat cheese and all that kind of stuff, so I wasn't that fat,  so I wanted him to be fat, so we had this fat suit, but that was the bane of my existence.  Man, and that was all three films?  No, by the third film, we'd all been through the battlefield, so we can't.  Yeah, he's not eating as much.  I bet it was your recommendation.  Look, this hobbit wouldn't be...  Yeah, come on, I've been on a pony. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah, what the fuck?  Let's take him off.  Not eating very well, not back in the shower.  Do a lot of cardio?  What do you think I'm doing over here?  Yeah, the hobbit could drop a few pounds.  They wanted us to look a little bit more, you know, spent by the end of it, and Pete made  a really good point, which was, you know, he had said the four hobbits really represent  those young guys going into war, the young privates going into war, and at the start,  they're all healthy and they're all together, and this is going to be a great adventure,  and by the end of it, they're all just done.  Beat up and spent.  So, he wanted it to look thinner and more messed up, which I think... 
[02:17:30]  Did you see the new one?  Yeah, I saw the hobbit, yeah.  I saw it in London, yeah.  It was a wild experience.  I sat there with Billy Boyd, and then we saw Pete afterwards.  It was very strange to be...  Must be.  ...watching Middle Earth and not be in it, and we talked to Pete about it, and he said,  I'm sure it must be strange, because he said, for me, it was strange going back into  it, but for you guys to watch it kind of in an abstract fashion.  I loved it.  I really liked it a lot.  The trilogy you did was such a part of your life.  I mean, how many years did you actually spend doing that?  Well, principal photography was just under two years, but then we went back every three 
[02:18:00]  years for eight weeks, you know, we'd go back to New Zealand, just over and over again.  Wow, that's a lot of...  Yeah, it was a long time.  I mean, Pete's a master filmmaker, so you can rely on him to bring set pieces and costume  and hair and makeup, and it looked beautiful.  It's great to see Andy and Ian, and I thought Martin Freeman did really well under the weight  of the film, which is such a big, heavy film.  Yeah, yeah.  That shot at the end was smog, you know, where you see his eye open, you're like, oh, let's  do this!  Son of a bitch! 
[02:18:30]  We've got to wait for that.  What do you think of the new technology in The Hobbit?  You mean the 48 frames a second?  Yeah, a lot of controversy over it.  I didn't mind it at all.  I really enjoyed it.  I got a little nauseous a couple of times, but it was a tribute to the actual, how realistic  the movie was.  I think Pete kind of has to do it, you know.  Pete, alongside kind of, you know, your James Camerons and your Steven Spielberg, is really  representing filmmakers nowadays.  And because Pete loves film so much, what he's attempting to say with that move, and he had  said to us that he wasn't ever going to move back from 48 frames a second again, was that 
[02:19:00]  he's willing to show everything.  He's willing to move forward with that technology, show the viewer everything that's being filmed,  at the risk of, for a couple of years, people saying, oh, I can't really get used to it.  But that is ultimately the future.  And if Pete isn't representing the future, then he's holding back that technology, you  know.  I mean, you know, Pete Jackson's legacy of what he was able to create, not only for  his own country, but for the industry itself, is amazing, you know.  Amazing.  He brought Hollywood to New Zealand, just said, I'm not going to leave, I'll do it here 
[02:19:30]  instead.  That's an amazing, what he's done for New Zealand, as far as their economy goes, is amazing.  I was driving around with a guy once in New Zealand working for the film, who had worked  with Pete for a while, and, you know, we knew that Pete was providing stuff like food for  the show, like, the pigs that we were eating were Pete Jackson's pigs, you know.  So he was getting a little, like, money for us to eat his lunch on his set, and all that  kind of stuff.  So I was asking the guy, like, I know he owned a cinema, and he owned this, and he owned 
[02:20:00]  that, and he was like, well, because he was from New Zealand, he was like, well, I can  show you the buildings that, you know, Pete Jackson's company owns, if you want.  And I was like, yeah, okay.  It's about 40% of the buildings we were driving back.  Wow.  That's Pete's, that's Pete's, that's Pete's, that's Pete's, that's Pete's, that's Pete's.  You know, but a lot of it is invested back into the country, you know.  He built a huge post-production studio so that films can get shot in New Zealand, but usually  they get sent to America, and now they can all get edited, and you can do ADR in New Zealand.  I saw the, I watched every bit of the behind the scenes, and what it took to make Lord of 
[02:20:30]  the Rings, the trilogy.  Watched, I mean, it was hours and hours of the discs.  But it was so new, some of the technology, and so amazing, the attention to detail, that  it wasn't like, oh, it's like every extra you see in a movie.  It was genuinely interesting to see what went behind it, and the work, and the commitment  of so many people that went into actually making such a giant movie like that.  From the software that was used for the big giant crowd scenes, to the real life shit, 
[02:21:00]  you know, I mean, like, like miniatures, if you don't realize, if you just CGI stuff,  you can see it, you can tell.  Those miniatures were just amazingly done, and then the costumes, and the attention to  detail on those things, and it makes a better film.  You'd think, like, those little details, as long as there's a story, and, you know,  we shoot it far away.  No, I think Pete's really passionate to show how much was put into it.  And, you know, there was a guy who, I met him close to day one of me getting to New Zealand, 
[02:21:30]  and then I saw him at the end of the post-production process, whose job was, in Weta, to make chain  mail.  He would sit there and make chain mail.  Like a guy from, you know, King Arthur's time.  He would just sit there, making chain mail, and you walk past.  Twisting little pieces of wire around.  What are you doing now?  He's like, oh, I'm doing a Boromir thing, and I'm hating life.  And then a couple months later, he'd be like, what are you doing now?  And he'd go, oh, I'm doing a Faromir thing, and I'm hating life.  I bet his thumb and forefinger were chewed to shit.  Yeah, yeah, poor guy. 
[02:22:00]  That's like a lot of tiny work.  I saw Pete, you know, I saw him at the premiere, and then I was in London making a film, and he  was in London for Christmas, and he invited me over to his place if I was free, and I  happened to be free one night.  And I brought this show that I'm doing right now, Wild Things, so Pete is deathly afraid  of spiders.  And you see spiders in The Hobbit a lot, and you see it in Lord of the Rings a lot, and  that's because Pete is really, really scared of spiders.  Oh, shit.  So I brought an episode of me looking for the world's largest spider, and we had dinner,  and we were chatting, and I said, do you want to watch the show? 
[02:22:30]  And he was like, yeah, yeah, let's watch it.  So he ran outside a little bit, and I was chatting with his family and just talking about stuff,  and then Pete came back in, and he was like, okay, come on, let's go watch it.  And I thought, all right, great.  So we're going to go sit down and watch it on TV, and we walk into his cinema.  He's got this huge screen, and he goes, everyone take a seat.  And we had these lazy boys in blankets and stuff, and he had this one remote controller,  and he was like, okay, is everyone ready?  And we all had wine and popcorn and stuff.  And he was like, okay, press one button, lights came down, curtains moved, show opened.  I was like, man, this is the coolest way to watch the show ever. 
[02:23:00]  In a cinema in Pete's house with a guy who's deathly afraid of spiders.  And the entire time we were watching it, he was going, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  What are you doing?  Put it down.  Put it down.  Tell us about the show.  Did you find the biggest spider?  I did, yeah.  How big is it?  The biggest spider is called the Giant Huntsman.  It's about the size of a dinner plate.  Jesus.  You know, that's its legs included, obviously.  It's a large spider.  It was only found to Western Science in the year 2000.  We were the second crew to go in there. 
[02:23:30]  The first one was the National Geographic crew.  Wow.  Lots of people in Laos knew about it, but they didn't go in and see it.  But we were the second Western crew to go in.  Wild Things, it's called Wild Things, it's on BBC America, 10, 9 Central on Tuesdays.  And OLN on Mondays.  It's my attempt to change people's ideas about some of these things that people might be intimidated about when they travel.  Different animals, different food, different currency, different people, different culture, stuff like that.  I've been lucky enough to travel all my life. 
[02:24:00]  I lived in Germany when I was a kid, moved around every three years.  You know, I was lucky enough to go to Italy and Spain and France when I was younger.  And then, you know, lived in New Zealand, obviously.  Thailand, went to France and Ireland and Costa Rica when I was younger.  And I just always found that travel for me was about the unknown, was about slightly walking on that tightrope of, you know, not knowing what's going to happen next and trying out new things.  And I think it's important for me, at least, to go somewhere where I don't know the currency and where I don't know what's going to happen. 
[02:24:30]  And Wild Things is kind of almost like a little love letter to all those experiences that I've had in the hope that maybe people will try and do the same thing.  Did you travel by choice or was it a family thing when you were younger?  My dad is a teacher, a science teacher.  My mom's a nurse.  And when they were young, when they were in their early 20s, they got a chance to go to Germany and work alongside the Army Forces.  So my dad would teach Army Forces kids.  And my mom would obviously take care of the Army Forces. 
[02:25:00]  And when the Army Forces were stationed, they would move every three or four years.  Take the teacher with them.  Yeah.  So when they would move, we would be like, OK, well, we'll move.  That's kind of cool.  So you don't get attached to one location too much.  You're able to kind of up and move when you have to?  Yeah.  I'm able to move pretty quickly.  I'm also very spongy in terms of where I'm living.  When we were in Germany and the Irish Guards were there, I had a little Irish accent.  And then when the Grenadier Guards came in, they were quite posh.  I had a little posh accent.  So I was a little actor when I was a kid.  And all my friends back in Manchester think that I sound American now, whereas all my 
[02:25:30]  friends in America...  Oh, that's hilarious.  Isn't that crazy?  They're like, oh, you sound like a yank.  I'm like, really?  I just sound like me.  But they're like, no, no, you don't.  You go.  You know what's different?  I say, here's two distinctions that I do do now.  One is I say American instead of what English people would say, which is American.  We'd go, oh, it's an American cheeseburger.  Whereas I go, oh, it's an American cheeseburger.  I do that err thing.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's subtle, but it's real.  And then the other thing, which is a little bit easier to spot, is I would say, I used  to say newspaper.  Now I say newspaper. 
[02:26:00]  Ah, news.  News.  News.  News.  News.  That's very posh to me.  Oh, the newspaper.  Camomile tea in the newspaper.  That's hilarious.  Wow.  Very subtle, but...  It's subtle, but it creeps in.  I don't do...  I don't say trash or trunk or anything like that.  Yeah.  You say rubbish?  I say rubbish, yeah.  Lifts?  I say wanker as much as possible.  Wanker?  Because in America, they're like, that's great.  Whereas in England, you can't say wanker.  You say elevators or wankers?  I say lifts.  You say lifts.  Yeah.  You say line or queue?  I say queue.  That is very confusing.  Lorry.  Truck or a lorry?  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Rubbish is a great word.  Yeah.  Rubbish.  Rubbish.  Fucking vocabulary.  Rubbish a little bit, right?  Every time I try an English accent, I slip into Australian.  Yeah, that is so weird.  I have people in the States all the time go, where are you from in Australia?  But it's like Jim Jefferies.  Yeah.  And I go, England.  And they go, oh, sorry about that.  It's the way it goes up at the end.  Yeah.  That always...  Jim Jefferies does that.  Ah.  So do most Americans think that English people sound like Australians?  Yeah, but it's very...  We don't think that.  I mean, we could not be more obvious.  We hear the difference, definitely.  We just can't do the impression.  I'm obsessed with the spider. 
[02:27:00]  We missed one fucking question.  Oh.  What does that spider do to you?  Well, it's venomous.  Oh, boy.  We're not sure how venomous, although smaller huntsman spiders are really quite venomous to  human beings.  Up until now, no human being has volunteered to be bitten by this spider.  Yeah.  But they were very gentle.  I managed to find one at the end of the show, and you have to hold it in a kind of demonstrative  way.  Oh, so you picked it up.  Yeah.  And then I picked it up, and I let it walk around in my hand.  It wasn't in any way inclined to bite me.  All right.  What was Peter doing at that point? 
[02:27:30]  Oh, he was just like, oh, what are you doing?  Oh, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Have you guys had him on the show?  No.  Oh, we'd love to have him.  Oh, we'd love to have him on the show.  That's right.  Yeah.  Oh, I'd definitely love to have him on the show.  Yeah, we'll do that in a second.  Are there the spiders that's in the...  What are the desert spiders they said that are over in Iraq and Afghanistan?  Oh, the camel spiders?  Yes.  Yeah, there's a lot of myths attached with those.  What happens is people hold them very close to the camera frame.  Oh, really?  So you do this forced perspective thing that Pete Jackson does all the time.  That's what I do when I'm sending dick shots to girls.  Yeah.  They're very close to the...  Yeah.  So they're not quite as big, not in your case, not quite as big as they look like on the frame, 
[02:28:00]  you know.  Have you guys been talking about Lance Armstrong this morning?  Oh, a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Some interesting stuff.  Yeah, we were talking about that.  It's amazing.  I mean, the capacity to lie like that is really something...  Well, you had to.  Yeah, but...  You just had to.  The whole sport was doping, though.  Yeah, yeah.  You know?  And he doesn't want to name names, but it's so obvious they all were doing it.  I think he was the best out of all the people that were doping.  So you take everybody, you bring them all up a level...  Up to a new level, and then he's the best in that level.  And he's the best out of all those, so... 
[02:28:30]  Absolutely.  You still got to give it to him.  Yeah, yeah.  It seems like he was in a tough spot because...  They hung him for it, yeah.  The sport was fully aware that this shit was going on.  He was the guy that made the most money out of it, and he was the poster boy, but they  didn't...  And then he was defiant when they were challenging.  Right, well, he sued the English Times because they said that he cheated.  Was it 1.5 million?  They just filed back now to get their money back?  There was a bunch of lawsuits.  Someone's 7.2 million?  Yeah, there's a lot of lawsuits there.  Yeah, it's crazy.  I was watching Piers Morgan last night, and he was saying...  He was talking about Lance Armstrong, and he was going, you know, shame on you, Lance Armstrong. 
[02:29:00]  And I wrote on Twitter, I was like, is Piers Morgan choking when he says those words?  This is someone who's the editor of the scummiest newspaper in the world.  And he had his criminal stuff, and he's going, shame on you, Lance Armstrong.  I'm like, wow, you got some balls.  You had to leave your own country because you were going to get in trouble.  Right.  And now, if you get sent back to your own country, you're going to get in trouble again.  Is that true?  He can't really go back there?  I think he left because he knew the heat was on.  Yeah, sure.  He came over here and tried to reinvent himself.  And he's also bullshitting because he didn't get the big interview. 
[02:29:30]  Yeah, yeah, of course.  He obviously wanted that interview, so he's pissed off about that as well.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah, of course.  And he would have been so sycophantic if he'd have got that interview.  He would have been like, oh, yeah, I mean, it must be tough for you.  I've only heard...  Oh, I know.  He's terrible.  What made him so scummy?  The News of the World was just an awful newspaper.  I mean, they went after people.  They spread lies about people.  They tapped people's phones.  They bribed police officers.  I mean, truly criminal stuff.  Mob mentality.  And what was his part in this?  He was the editor.  He was the editor. 
[02:30:00]  And he completely washed his hands of it.  He was like, I have no idea.  You're the editor of that newspaper.  Of course you knew.  Who's the girl?  Is this the one that Murdoch owned?  Yeah, it was Rebecca someone.  Rebecca something.  Right.  And there was a 13-year-old girl who was missing.  She was dead.  But they were checking her messages.  So the family found out that this 13-year-old girl's messages were being checked, so they  thought she might be alive somewhere.  Oh, shit.  They gave this family...  I think Murdoch apologized to them himself personally, because I don't think Rupert Murdoch  knew it was going on.  Wow, that is really bad.  False hope. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Terrible.  Exactly that.  They said, oh, she must be alive because the messages are changing.  And they tapped the royal family's phones and David Beckham's phones and all these people  trying to link together some sort of criminal stuff.  And then bribing police officers.  Thanks for your help.  Here you go.  Here's 300 pounds.  Wow.  Jesus.  They gave me Iraq.  Yeah, yeah.  30 pounds.  And he's fat.  Why would CNN hire him then?  I don't know.  They're not on the up and up either, obviously.  There's this weird thing that happens in the States where if you're English and you speak 
[02:31:00]  correctly, people think that you are legit.  Yeah.  And he's relatively posh, you know.  Americans are hypnotized by that English accent.  They totally are.  It's got to be fucking, it's got to be honest.  It's got to be nice guys.  Ladies, love it.  Talking like an Englishman.  Yes.  But the most important question, you got to tell us what's going to happen on the next  season of Lost.  Come on.  Come on.  What?  You know, I've been.  How many times do you hear that one?  Oh, my God.  You know, the number one question that I get on Twitter, and I love being on Twitter, and 
[02:31:30]  it's really fun.  I've got some amazing followers.  What's your Twitter name?  Dom's Wild Things.  But you can search Dominic Monahan.  Okay, cool.  I'll follow you.  Hell yeah.  Hell yeah, do.  That'd be great.  But the number one question that I get is, you know, what do you prefer, Lost or Lord  of the Rings, or who's your favorite, Charlie or Mary?  And, you know, there's two huge benchmark moments in my career.  And you couldn't do that.  No, no.  You couldn't say, oh, I'd rather do this than the other.  I had so much fun on both of those things.  I own both of them.  There's a lot of talk. 
[02:32:00]  There's a lot of, like, rumored talk about a film right now.  Yeah, yeah.  And I just, you know, they're always asking the wrong people.  You need to talk to Damon Lindelof, who created the show.  And, you know, I think Damon is so far away from Lost at this point.  He loved doing the show.  He's an amazing writer.  But, you know, he's screenwriting so many different things.  I just don't think it's going to be part of Damon's wheelhouse to say, okay, all that  work that I've done, I'm now going to go back.  I think in my head, in 20 years' time, 30 years' time, maybe you could sell the franchise 
[02:32:30]  to another writer and they could reboot the show.  But you're not going to get all those acts back together again.  I wouldn't.  No, no.  How hard is it to die in a series when you know that your time is coming?  Do they tell you in the beginning of the season?  Or do you find out the week before, this is it for you?  I knew.  Your death scene was fucking great.  Oh, thanks.  I knew that something was coming.  You know, I had a relationship with Damon where I could check in with him via email  and I knew that something was reaching ahead.  Essentially what had happened with... 
[02:33:00]  Like he wrote back, who's this?  Yeah.  He wrote back, call back in a week.  I knew something was happening because obviously the storyline that I was on was, you know,  the character that I was playing was potentially going to die or was continuing to cheat death.  So I knew that something was happening.  But I had a conversation with Damon where I had become a little frustrated with essentially  kind of becoming like the babysitter on the show, you know?  I mean, I love babies.  I love hanging out with babies.  But for the love of God, get me out there with a gun. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  I was on the beach, you know, taking care of the baby or, you know, providing fictional peanut  butter for Claire.  And I was like, all right, come on.  Where's the AK-47?  Where's the Afghani heroine?  Let's do this.  Tear some shit up here.  And I think Damon, you know, very sweetly thought, all right, well, I appreciate that  comment.  And I think I can find a way to make it work for both of us, whereby we set you on a collision  course where you work more and ultimately has you exit.  And in my head, I remember thinking at some point, all these characters are going to have 
[02:34:00]  their end game scene.  And if I'm in the midst of that crowd of people, I'm going to dilute what I've done.  Whereas if I isolate the fact that my exit is different from everyone else's in terms  of the time, maybe I'll get a better crack of the whip.  And then Lost is an odd show because when someone died off on the show, you came back because  there were so many flashbacks and whatnot.  So it's not like you're off the show like you would be on another program.  And also they're rule-breaking, you know, people as a show.  So once I left at the end of season three, my big push to Damon was they're obviously 
[02:34:30]  going to say, is he coming back?  Where is he?  Why don't we bring me back for the first episode of the fourth season?  And people will go, oh, he's going to be in this every week.  He's going to be like Obi-Wan Kenobi.  And then I was out, you know, so I like that they're constantly pulling the rug out from  it.  It was, it kept everyone guessing.  That's for sure.  I get asked all the time about the ending and I didn't see it.  I was working.  I was in New York working on a film called I Sell the Dead, this horror film, period.  It was drama and very different from the character that I played in Lost. 
[02:35:00]  And I didn't want to watch me on Lost because I'll sponge some of that character.  So I avoided it.  And then all the time people like watch Think of the Ending.  And I'm like, I didn't see it.  I didn't see it.  But you didn't want to watch this end.  No, because I can't go back and watch seasons with me on it.  Like, oh, fantastic.  Look at me there.  But you've got to see the end.  You've still not seen the final episode.  I know what happened.  Let me tell you what happened.  You got a moment?  I read the script, obviously.  I know what happens.  It's so weird to me that you wouldn't want to just put it in. 
[02:35:30]  Even though you just read it and didn't see it, are you happy with what was written?  And do you understand?  Because a lot of people have no understanding of what the end was.  Do you understand what had happened?  You know, Damon's on Twitter as well.  And Damon's profile on Twitter is something like, I'm one of the idiots that wrote Lost.  And no, I don't understand it either.  That's very funny.  You know, I think they were always going to be in a kind of damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. 
[02:36:00]  Because they had such a fan base at that point.  You're going to disappoint someone.  Right.  I thought they did really well.  But I was a big fan of the end of The Sopranos.  I was a big fan of the end of Six Feet Under, where you made up your own mind to a certain extent.  And they grow on you, those endings.  Yeah, at first you're frustrated, but you love it.  Yeah, you want to throw something through your TV.  What the fuck?  After all that time I put in, you give me that?  Now I love how The Sopranos ended.  At first I was frustrated like everyone else.  I thought it was great.  And also, if you're going to try and placate everyone with the end of Lost, you'd need fireworks and JFK coming back and Muhammad Ali fighting Sonny Liston. 
[02:36:30]  You need every little moment in history in that encapsulated piece.  Right, right.  Dominic, let me ask you, what do you think The Sopranos ending is all about?  I think...  He's dead, right?  Yeah.  He gets shot.  Yeah.  And that's how your life ends.  It just goes dark.  Yeah, I think what they were saying was, for me at least, personally, this guy is an extraordinary guy who's made some very dark, deep choices in his life. 
[02:37:00]  And he's made peace with some of it and some stuff he's not okay with.  And ultimately, it's not going to end in that huge meteoric way that you think with this big, like, you know, Tony Montana type guy.  It's going to end in a way that's silly.  Maybe some guy comes in off the street that's just a stick-up kid.  Yeah, yeah.  And robs the till.  And Tony goes over and says, hey, don't do that.  And he shoots him in the belly and he dies.  I thought what they were saying was, at the end of it all, he's just like all of us. 
[02:37:30]  He's just a guy.  He wants to eat a slice of bread.  Kind of like how Omar died in The Wire.  That same shit.  That was the worst TV death ever.  Where it was just a throwaway.  Yeah, I saw the wire.  Because you expected this big, grand gunfight.  The big showdown.  What did he say?  I'm going to break your heart.  Right.  He said, I'm going to break your heart to the fans before the season started.  Yeah.  I think that's what happens in life a lot.  Everyone thinks that the death thing is going to be such a huge deal. 
[02:38:00]  And sometimes it's not.  You know, when John Lennon was killed, you know, you're expecting this poet, this voice of a generation to utter something amazing.  Right, right.  And when he got shot, he said, I've been shot.  And then he died.  And you're like, what?  Why didn't you say your mind from one of your songs or something?  Tell us the name of your new album.  I've been shot.  And then he's out.  You're like, oh, come on, John.  Give him another go.  There's a thing in the law where they show you warming up your voice.  You just made me think of it.  And you're going, Sugar Plum Fairy, Sugar Plum Fairy. 
[02:38:30]  That is a Beatles tribute, right?  Because I heard that they were doing that in some warm-up.  Yeah.  In the rehearsal takes for A Day in the Life,  John Lennon counts in the piano by going, Sugar Plum Fairy.  Right.  I'm a Lennon freak and I'm a Beatles freak.  So all that kind of stuff I'm really into.  And we did a few Beatles-y things throughout the show.  And Oasis was a big thing for Drive Shaft.  And also the Verve, you know the band The Verve, Richard Ashcroft.  Sure, yeah.  Bittersweet Symphony was a big song for those guys. 
[02:39:00]  He came in and out of, I think, struggling with drugs.  And we wanted someone that had been there and had had those dark moments,  but was ultimately trying to do the right thing.  The struggle, you know.  Yeah, yeah.  I like the struggle.  It was very entertaining, though, how people sort of knew you.  Yeah.  Like a couple of people were like, I know that song.  And you were very excited.  Your character was very excited that you were recognized.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's the desperate thing, I think, is if you're a huge star, 
[02:39:30]  if you're Robert Plant or David Bowie, then you're like,  yeah, yeah, that's me, and I'm comfortable with it.  Yeah.  But if you're someone where they go, where do I know you from?  And you have to go, do you know the song You All Everybody?  And they go, no.  And you go, do you want me to sing it?  And they go, no, for fuck's sake.  And you go, all right, close your eyes.  Right, right, here it is.  And they go, oh, yeah, that was kind of a shit one.  And you go, yeah, that was shit.  That's you all, right, yeah, yeah.  Did you do anything else?  No, not that.  We brought it out again the following Christmas. 
[02:40:00]  Oh, yeah, yeah.  That kind of stuff is so desperate.  Yeah, yeah.  That was so great that the character was like a rock star.  Yeah, yeah.  There was a pathetic nature to Charlie, a desperation to Charlie.  He wanted so much to be authentic, and he could play the piano,  and he could play the guitar, but his brother let him down,  and he let himself down, and he made some bad choices,  and he got on junk, and he went the wrong way.  And he was so keen to be the guy who'd done it.  And, yeah, that was me at Madison Square Gardens, 
[02:40:30]  but he didn't get there.  Never got to that point.  And instead, he ends up on this fucking island,  and he's so frustrated by it all.  He's like, man, if I had one more chance,  I'd go back and I'd be a rock star.  And I can't.  And instead, I'm left holding the baby and eating peanut butter.  Fake peanut butter.  To have such a huge ensemble cast like that,  and to have the viewing audience directly involved with each one of them  is an amazing thing.  You rarely see that where you can get a vested interest  in so many characters and their storylines. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, and you were watching.  We shot the pilot, and we knew the pilot was extraordinary.  JJ shot the pilot with us, and he and David.  Boy, did that suck a lot of people in right there.  That pilot was just like, what the fuck?  This is like a major motion picture.  I couldn't believe how fucking much that...  People were talking about Lost for a while.  It was like in season two.  I'm like, fuck you.  I'm not watching it.  Mr. Too Hip for the Room.  And that fucking pilot leveled me.  I ripped through the season.  I could not stop watching it.  I would put that pilot up against any pilot episode on TV. 
[02:41:30]  And also, the first season of Lost, I would say,  is one of the best seasons of any TV show ever.  You know, JJ shot the pilot.  Damon and he wrote it.  We knew we were doing something pretty special  because it just felt very special.  JJ was obviously on form, and he's always on form.  But what I watched was characters like Jorge Garcia's character  or Josh Holloway's character  or some of these other characters that for a while  were waiting in the wings.  I mean, Josh became pretty much an overnight sex symbol. 
[02:42:00]  You know, I mean, he's doing adverts for Cool Water  and turning up at Jimmy Kimmel  and the girls are losing their panties  and all that kind of stuff.  You know, I mean, he very quickly  just turned into this sex symbol.  So you realize that there was some power we'd lost.  But because we were filming out in Hawaii,  we weren't filming in L.A.  where anyone's out on a party scene  or, you know, getting shot by a paparazzi.  Like, we were on Hawaii.  So you'd work and, you know,  you'd go to the restaurant at night  or you'd go surf at the weekend.  So you didn't really have a gauge  of how famous all these characters were getting. 
[02:42:30]  No, you felt it when the show ended,  you know, you're on hiatus  and then we'd go and do press stuff.  I mean, we flew to Australia  when it blew up in Australia  and you were like, wow, this is pretty epic.  Like, I've been to Australia with Lord of the Rings  and it was the same kind of feeling.  Wow, yeah.  Pretty big in Australia  and it did well in, you know, in England for a while.  And yeah, it's just one of those great shows  to be involved with.  You had a thing with,  are you and Matthew Fox talked  or do you want nothing to do with him?  I don't, you know, I'm not.  I think it's like work, you know. 
[02:43:00]  I mean, sometimes you work with people  that you're okay with  and sometimes you work with people  that you're not super okay with.  I mean, there's certain things  about certain personalities  that you're not that passionate about.  And I have things that I'm okay with people  if they have those as personality traits  and then other things  that are just non-starters for me.  And I think, you know,  he and I didn't really have those.  What was the issue  for the people that don't know?  You don't want to rehash this,  it sounds like. 
[02:43:30]  I mean, you can read about it.  I don't think there's a huge amount  of smoke without fire, you know.  I don't really, you know,  I don't say things  that don't have intention.  But I think it's like work.  I mean, you know,  I was lucky enough on Lord of the Rings  to work with a whole bunch of people  that I really like  and continue to like.  And that was the same  for the most part  on most of the projects that I had.  And then every so often  you meet someone,  there's a personality clash  you don't really get on very well.  That's like any job though.  Yeah, yeah, that's just how it works.  I think because it's a public job,  people expect that  you're all going to be friends  and, you know,  but then it got to a point  where I was like, 
[02:44:00]  you know what,  I'm a big fan of breaking myths  and I'm not super interested  in people thinking one thing  about someone  where I know all these other things  that aren't true, you know.  Is it hard as an actor to watch,  because I'm embarrassed  I don't remember Kate's real name.  Evangeline.  Evangeline.  And you were dating.  Is it hard to watch  when you're an actor,  the girl you're with  do a love scene with somebody?  Like, I know it's a professional thing,  but like as a guy,  is there a party that goes like,  ugh.  Doesn't look like she's really acting.  Are you able to totally detach from that? 
[02:44:30]  Right.  I can certainly detach better than most.  You just,  because you've also been in situations  where you do it  and you know it doesn't really mean anything.  So you know to them  that it probably doesn't mean that much.  Sometimes it can be a little strange,  especially when you're like,  okay, have a good day at work.  And you're like,  you know what scenes are coming up.  You kind of know what they're doing that day.  But for the most part,  you just kind of get on with it.  You know, it is a facet of work.  And I don't think,  if they could have the choice  to do that,  to have that day or not, 
[02:45:00]  they would probably choose to not have it.  It's not something where they're like,  oh sweet,  this is going to be a great day,  you know.  So you just kind of get through.  Yeah.  On the new show there,  what places have you been to?  In the first season,  we went to Ecuador, Venezuela,  Cameroon, Namibia,  Laos,  Vietnam,  Malaysia,  and Guatemala.  Did you ever feel any danger?  You know,  Venezuela was probably the gnarliest.  Nothing was super crazy, 
[02:45:30]  but we had security in Venezuela,  in some of the major cities.  And you felt like they knew that you were a car  that if they could jack you,  they would.  Oh, wow.  It was a car filled with,  you know,  four or five Westerners  and a lot of camera equipment  and, you know,  money,  obviously.  And I think people were looking at you going,  who are these guys?  So we had security there  and they were a little dodgy.  There was a lot of passing around of cash,  you know,  like under the table.  And you'd reach a roadblock 
[02:46:00]  and the police would be there  and they'd come over  and ask for passports  and instead our translator would be like,  well,  why don't I give you $100 instead?  Oh, it's a toll.  Yeah.  Oh, there you go.  So it goes to the highway system.  Yeah,  that kind of stuff was happening  in Venezuela  more than anything else.  But I just,  I just smile  and put on an English accent  and they just,  they just say,  hello.  I always go,  hi,  I've come on holiday by mistake.  And they're like,  there you go.  It must be so nice  to not be an American  when you go overseas.  Holy shit.  Yeah.  And stuff really helps, 
[02:46:30]  you know,  and humans are humans.  I mean,  ultimately we're obviously not armed.  We're not doing anything illegal.  Right.  Yeah.  I feel like if it,  if it,  if it reaches a,  you know,  a boiling point,  you can kind of say to these guys,  look,  we're here making a TV show  and you know,  what's,  what's the deal?  How can we make this work?  You know?  So I never really feel like  I can't solve those problems.  If I can attempt to solve  the issue of hanging out with  a cobra or a viper,  then I feel like I can deal  with a gnarly human.  Yeah.  Were you really looking for a set?  This is,  this amazing,  they give a synopsis  of all these things that, 
[02:47:00]  you know,  fucking army ants  and a centipede rumored  to snatch bats out of the air.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What the?  Scalopendra gigantea,  that's called.  It lives in caves in Venezuela.  So it's about,  it's about a foot long.  Wow.  Venomous centipede.  And the,  the cool thing about it  is it'll climb the cave wall  and then climb up the ceiling  and then invert itself.  So it'll hang a third of its body  off the cave ceiling.  Holy shit.  And it'll blindly  just grab bats  out of the night sky  and envenomate them. 
[02:47:30]  And we actually see one  in the episode  eating a bat.  I mean,  they're crazy looking.  I have one on the end  of a stick  and it's,  I keep them at home  and it's the only animal  that I'm,  I'm pretty nervous of.  I have a black widow spider,  I have a tarantula,  I have snakes,  I have praying mantis,  I have a chameleon.  My,  a scolopendra,  my centipede,  is the one animal  that I'm really conscious of  how I feed it  and when I feed it  because it will try and get me.  So obviously you're a fan  of these animals.  Yeah,  yeah,  I like the misunderstood,  you know,  I like the animals  that are vilified, 
[02:48:00]  I like the underdog  and obviously invertebrates,  usually insects,  but lots of invertebrates.  People just think  that they're useless  and pointless and silly  and you can crush them.  Insects are the most important  species of animal  on the planet  in terms of what they do  for our planet.  You know,  they till our soil,  they keep our air fresh,  they pollinate our fruits  and vegetables and plants  and stuff  and they're just important.  They do a lot  and we can learn a lot from them.  I mean,  human beings don't really feature  in the most important animals.  They're probably the most  damaging animal in the world  and they don't feature 
[02:48:30]  in the top 50 important animals.  The most important animal  in the world  is probably something like a worm  or an ant  or a small beetle  or a parasitic wasp  because of what they do  for the planet,  you know,  and we just flick them away,  you know,  we just think they're silly  but they're important.  Let's think others.  I'd respect the wasp a lot more  if it didn't fucking  crawl into my grape soda  at a picnic.  Fly in my mouth.  Isn't that frightening  when you're at a picnic  or something  and you have a can of soda  and you're like,  I always think,  I'm like,  you know,  I don't want to swallow a bee 
[02:49:00]  but I really want some soda here.  So you're looking around  and shake it.  Shake it a little bit  and see if something pops up.  They love sugar.  Like everything else,  they love sugar,  you know.  Yeah.  But they don't mean  to sting you.  They're stinging you  because suddenly  they were in a can of soda  drinking and probably drowning  and then suddenly  they're in something's mouth  and they're going to get chewed  so they sting you,  you know.  They don't do it  with any intention  apart from,  you know,  I'm going to die here.  Exactly.  How quick is the centipede?  Centipede's fast.  The one you got?  Yeah,  it's very fast.  The centipede could,  you know,  get across this table 
[02:49:30]  in a way that we would  all jump out of the way of me.  Whoa.  Yeah,  I'd be out of this room.  It moves quick like a cockroach.  I'm not a fan of the insect.  I've got to be honest with you.  I'm not,  you know,  going around burning them  with magnifying glasses  or anything,  but I am not a fan.  Don't like touching them.  Don't like when they're around.  I can see them.  I'm not going to freak out.  But here in Manhattan,  if you walk down the sidewalks  at night,  you will see some big roaches.  Yeah,  yeah.  And you hear them.  They're like,  across the sidewalk.  I want no part of that.  Yeah,  yeah.  I mean,  I can see that. 
[02:50:00]  There's a natural kind of aversion  to that.  I mean,  you know,  they obviously spend a lot of time  in our refuse and trash and stuff  and they're a little dirty  and they can spread disease  and they're weird.  They're alien.  I mean,  you know,  you cut off a cockroach's head,  it will survive until it starves to death.  It won't die from the fact  that you've beheaded it.  Like Iraq again.  Yeah.  They're amazing.  They're amazing animals in that regard.  I just think that  sometimes the animals  that we do think are disgusting  and are scary and stuff,  that might be true,  but they're also impressive  and they also demand 
[02:50:30]  a little bit of respect.  Oh yeah,  I'll watch a documentary  like a motherfucker on bugs.  Oh boy,  I love,  you know,  the science behind them  and that,  but,  you know,  the YouTube is pretty much  not full of bug videos,  but kittens galore.  People love a good cute kitten.  That's true.  I gotta tell you.  Just falling down stairs.  Yes,  adorable.  I wish I could look at bugs like that.  That's such a nice way to look at bugs.  I just panic  and want to step on them  because they freak me out.  I know that they do things,  but I just,  I can't look at that 
[02:51:00]  and go,  well,  he's not going to sting me.  Murder him.  It's one of the most easily accessible ways  to have an interaction with nature  on a daily basis  and I've always found  that all those moments for me  have been super positive.  So if I can get myself  in a situation often  where I can be like,  oh,  there's a bee  or there's a spider  or whatever,  something like that,  it really informs on my state of mind.  It makes me feel better.  So I think I've just constantly  had positive affirmations from that  and obviously,  if I were to go over to a bee  all the time and get stung,  I'd feel differently about it. 
[02:51:30]  But up until now,  that's not happening.  There's a video,  a guy has a YouTube channel  where he pets hornet nests  and he has one.  It is this.  Yeah,  but he has one in his home  in his living room.  He loves hornets.  In his living room.  He transferred a real hornet's nest.  He has a net around half of it  so they aim towards the window  and they leave.  But he puts his little awful,  dirty,  smoke-colored hands in  and he pets the hornet nest  and he finger-feeds hornets  and giant wasps.  He's a psychopath. 
[02:52:00]  What a tool.  We got a break.  You know what?  We're going to watch this show, man.  It's fantastic.  Sounds great.  Dominic Monaghan,  of course,  is Wild Things  with Dominic Monaghan.

I know you guys are fans  of Damon and JJ and Pete  and all that kind of stuff  so I really want to come back  and see you guys.  Yeah,  we've had JJ on.  He's a lot of fun.  He's a cool guy. 
[02:52:30]  I like that guy.  Yeah.  I was kind of giving him  a little crap about  the lens flare  in the first Star Trek.  Oh,  he does a lot of that.  Oh,  does he love a good lens flare?  Yeah,  yeah,  he does.  But man,  is he funnier than you'd expect?  Oh,  yeah,  yeah.  He's great.  He's a great hang.  Yeah,  we know he's going to be smart  and sharp  because he makes those things  man.  He's down to earth,  man.  Yeah,  he is.  Cool guy.  Dominic,  thanks so much,  man.  See you guys.  Real pleasure to have you on.  Thank you.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah,  this is the O.P.

Yeah,  maybe we'd sneak in  line of the day.  Josh Gad comes walking in  and we talk about 1600 Penn  and then we start  our long weekend.  Fuck it up.  Hey,  we're off for  Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  That's right,  because we love the blacks.  Because I wanted  to get up early Monday  and not to come here,  but to celebrate  that man's life 
[02:54:00]  and what he gave  all of us  who only want  a more free  and open,  fair,  diverse country.  It should be illegal  that you're off  for Martin Luther King Day.  Oh.  It should be illegal.  Oh.  Sorry.  Martin Luther King.  Yes.  His day is Monday.  Let us celebrate  by remembering  our African-American friends.  Our strength  in this country 
[02:54:30]  is through  its diversity.  What does  he mean to you?  What have you learned  from his teachings?  I like  when I have  a dream  and I rape  girls in it.  Will you hurry up  with line of the day  before he says something?  It's going to get us  in a lot of trouble.  No, I like dream rape.  Josh Gad?  Because I'm a dream raper.  Where's Josh?  What?  Rape at all.  Dominic was amazing.  I love Dominic. 
[02:55:00]  I like dream raping  because dream raping  can make me smile.  How many runner-ups?  I like dream raping.  How many runner-ups  we got?  We have two.  All right,  let's do a runner-up  line of the day.  Dream rape.  Dream, dream, rape.  Dream, rape.  I have a bunch of dream songs  that I could sing  about dream rape.  The dream rapist  ba-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.  The dream rapist  da-na-na-na-na-na.  Runner-up line of the day.  I'd never fuck a chick  with leukemia.  Blood cancer?  Nerts to you,  I'd say. 
[02:55:30]  They get dirty popcorn.  They get dirty popcorn.  Very nice.  We'll go right  to the next  runner-up line of the day.  I'm gonna grab her  freckled-ass cheeks and open up  her bung and give her  a savage buggering.  The laugh.  It's that fucking laugh that got me.  That Efezima laugh.  Holy shit. 
[02:56:00]  Josh Gad?  What?  What's the update for Roland?  I'm sure he's coming.  Let's do your line of the day.  We don't know if it's happened yet.  Maybe it hasn't happened yet.  We're trying to squeeze this in so we can get to the Josh Gad.  If we do the Josh Gad, we're not going to do the line of the day.  If it happens in the future,  will we be able to  go through some kind of time portal  and get that and come back  and replace that as line of the day  based, of course, on your hit screenplay 
[02:56:30]  blah, blah, blah, the blah, blah.  Like sliders?  I can't tell you.  We could add one if it happens.  I want to know about this Josh Gad thing.  Okay, because I wasn't sure if  Roland was playing some trickery with us.  They have so many funny lines ready to come out now.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Just improv stuff.  Here comes Josh.  All right, wait, let's do line of the day  before he gets in here.  Go!  Go!  Here  comes  line of the day  line of the day  line of the day  line of the day 
[02:57:00]  line of the day  The fact that  what wound up happening is  we have  Teo  who  wound up  Teo  wound up  excuse me  Teo wound up  Aids  The dude from Deadspin  That was great 
[02:57:30]  And right on cue  Josh Gad  Yeah  He's a big star now  this Josh Gad  What's up, Josh?  That's right  Last time I came here  you guys wouldn't give me the time of day  Oh, man  Remember?  Remember?  I remember that  Oh, you're a theater actor  Oh, yeah  Right?  Oh, the theater  What's that like?  Fun?  Let me tell you about this theater actor  really fast  Yesterday  me and  the wife there  are online  trying to get tickets for Book of Mormon 
[02:58:00]  I know you passed this, Josh  but let me just share this with you  We want to turn someone in our family  on to the Book of Mormon  $800  No shit  $800 for tickets  and this wasn't a ticket agency  Jesus  This was the box office  You should have called me  I couldn't help you  but you should have called me  You should have called me  But they're now going for  I guess $400 a pop  through the box office  Wow  That's amazing  It's still very good  Where is that on stage?  No, the seats were  they were good  but they weren't like  holy shit good  Damn  How much did you pay to see me, though? 
[02:58:30]  Free  Oh, man  How does that make you feel?  How does that make you feel?  Gratis  That was before they  It's actually really depressing  They got rid of that free shit  right after us, though  We skated  Did you really get to see it for free?  Yeah  Yeah, we were one of the  I mean, because they didn't do that for anyone  I got to see it three times for free  Once because we were interviewing you  Yep  And you didn't sing that day  because you had something with your throat  And I loved it so much  And they're like, look  We apologize, Josh  Because you're interviewing  Do you want to see it with him in it?  We'll have you come back  when Josh's in it 
[02:59:00]  I'm like, yeah  So I went back again  and I saw it with you in it  Amazing again  three or four days later  Someone bought a ticket for me recently  but Andrew's not in it  Michael Potcher's not in it  and you're not in it  How much do you want?  Because you really did save me money  I'll take what the equivalent would have been  which would have been about $400  and I'd like that in hard cash  I got $40  I'll take it as a down payment  to what you owe me  No, it's still  I actually got to see it the other night  which was an out-of-body experience 
[02:59:30]  I can imagine  Was that the first time you saw it?  No, it was the first time I saw the Broadway cast  I got to see it on tour  Andrew and I both went to the opening of the LA tour  and it was incredible  but it was really like looking over your body  It's just like, what the hell is happening here?  Did you like the version?  I can't imagine how nervous  they must have been with you two in the audience  No, they did an extraordinary job  It was so cool to see somebody else's interpretation  of what I've been playing for a year and a half 
[03:00:00]  and then going back and seeing my cast do it  was remarkably weird  I bet you're just being nice  because that's like saying  Oh, I enjoy  like your wife starts sleeping with someone else  you look in the window and go  I enjoyed watching someone else's interpretation  of fucking my wife  But I do  Oh, okay  But I do  Then we're fine  I think it's great  It gives me ideas  It gives me like  Oh, that's what I should have done  I like what he did with that ass part  Yeah, I never thought to do that  I didn't know you could physically do that 
[03:00:30]  I never thought to shoe polish my whole body  It's got to be strange to see  Book of Mormon  How many times  How many shows did you end up doing?  Did you keep track?  Yeah, I did about 450  Wow  I did about 450 performances  And  Now that you're not part of it  Did it ever get old?  Be honest  I would have told you  while I was doing it  it was getting old  I have like ADD big time  So for me  When I do something for more than a week  I'm like 
[03:01:00]  The same thing  I'm like  Oh, fuck  What am I doing?  This is insanity  But  By the end of it  I was really like  Just kind of checking out a little bit  And just being like  Oh, God  I wonder what I'm going to get after the show  I'm starving right now  Kind of on autopilot?  Yeah, you tend to get there  And then  Something happens  Where you're just like  Oh, okay  I totally forgot all my lines  Because my brain was elsewhere  And you're like  That won't happen again  Have you done that?  Oh, my God  There was a night  Oh, shit  There was a night 
[03:01:30]  Where I literally  I was singing the second app  Opening  You're making things up again, Arnold  And there's a line  That opens the song  And I  Not only did I forget  The line  I forgot the human fucking language  I forgot English  I literally forgot how to speak English  I couldn't come up with anything  They're staring at me  My cast is feeding me the line  The guy in the pit  Is feeding me the line  And I was so  All I heard was  It was like a ringing in my ears 
[03:02:00]  I couldn't hear anything  And I'm like  Literally  All I could say was  What the fuck am I supposed to say right now?  That's what I said  You said that?  I said that  That's great  I literally could not  Because everybody was like  Feeding me the line  Like  Josh, the line  And I'm like  I can't hear you  So what was going on in your mind?  I don't even remember  I was just like  It was literally  It must have been like  God, it would be really nice  If I could take a shit right now  It was like something like that  Were you so freaked out  Did you go to a doctor 
[03:02:30]  To make sure your brain was okay?  Yeah, well it's just  You know, you can't  Like  You do the same thing  Over and over again  That  You know, you're like  Oh, okay  I can think about whatever right now  It doesn't really matter  And then all of a sudden  You're like  Oh, God  Oh, God  I've done this so many times  But it can just go away like that  So you become very hypersensitive to it  Did that not happen to anybody  Or did everyone go through it?  No, I think it tends to happen to  Andrew went up online  I mean  We all go up online  It's a part of  When you do a show for  Over a year and a half 
[03:03:00]  Which I did  It just becomes a little  All right  I just saw something  You're obviously here to promote 1600 Penn  That's right  You met Obama?  I met Obama  Holy fuck  How was that?  It was incredible  He's very presidential  Were you freaked out?  I was very freaked out  He comes up to me  And he goes  So  It's a pleasure to meet you  I go  Literally  That's all I could say  And he goes  How are you today?  I said  Well, Mr. President  I'm much better now 
[03:03:30]  And I don't know  What the fuck  The implication of that statement was  It must have been like  Was I bad?  Like giving a tour of the White House  But he was incredible  He was so generous  He gave us about 20 minutes of his time  Talked to us about the importance of comedy  Especially in light of the fact that  The work that he does is so serious  And sometimes it's important to laugh  I got a second question  Because our friend Sway met President Obama  And he says  You're fully aware that if you do something stupid 
[03:04:00]  You could die in that room  That's right  That's Sway's interpretation  He's like  You see these guys that mean business  And they're not going to fuck around  They will kill you if they have to  Was he lighting cigars with $100 bills  And saying  This is Anthony Cumia's tax money  They're just lighting cigars  And they're on  Have them all boys  Come on  No?  No that didn't happen  That didn't happen right there  Because I heard that was going on in there  Did you have the awareness though  That you had to be on your  Uber best behavior?  Oh absolutely  He's also a very intimidating man 
[03:04:30]  Like he's just  Has a very powerful presence  That's racist  Really?  Yeah well that's exactly  He has a very powerful  Powerful presence  And he's just  I love him  And I was just blown away  By the fact that he spent so much time  That's so cool  Very generous  Did he watch 1600 Penn  Would you guys or?  No he didn't  So he gets up into the screening room  He introduces it  And he gives a 10 minute speech  John Lovett  Who's one of the writers on our show  Used to be a speech writer for him  And it was basically like 
[03:05:00]  He just was razzing him  For a good 5 minutes  And then  Talked about the show a little bit  And then he goes  So  This is the worst impression of a mama  Of all time by the way  And I readily admit it  But he goes  So it was my intention  To watch the show today  But  Turns out  I've got something to do  And I just thought  Of course you have something to do  You probably have  That's a great excuse  To always have  If that's in your back pocket  You're not going to question that  No if that's in your back pocket  You're good  The leader of the free world 
[03:05:30]  Probably could come up  With something a little more important  One other question  Does he have a sense of humor?  Absolutely  It doesn't come across as well on TV  Oh my god  He's got an incredibly  Every one of the seats in the theater  What?  Nothing  He's got an incredible sense of humor  And was  Like I said  He was just razzing John  And it was like  Laugh out loud material  He's great  Didn't he say his favorite show  Is Chappelle's show?  He loves Chappelle's show  Did he?  Yeah yeah yeah  It's hilarious  He's very funny  He's a very funny guy 
[03:06:00]  Yeah  He's really funny  Man so okay  You got the new show  Got the new show  Now you're working with Bill Pullman  I am  You remember him  From other presidential roles  Please  Independence Day  Yeah  One of my favorites  Right  David my David  That's my favorite part  Just Judd Hirsch  Being  Not being the stereotypical  I think his part was written  By like Goebbels  That was fucking  The most stereotypical  My son David saved you  My son David 
[03:06:30]  Oh my god  He's back in the role  Of the presidency  This time  He plays a good president  He plays a great president  You know  Once they rebuilt  The White House  I think he's much more  Accountable  To make sure  It doesn't happen again  And yeah  He's amazing  I mean the guy  Is just  You know what's so great  About him though  Is like everybody  Remembers him from  Independence Day  But it's like  If you go back  And you look at  Spaceballs  Ruthless people  The guy is a  Genius comedian  He really is  Brilliantly funny  And dry witted 
[03:07:00]  And that's the part  For us  That was so great  Is that like  He was bringing  That kind of comedy  Juice  And you are  Yeah  You're the first son  I'm the first son  How  Who was the last  First son  In the White House  I'm gonna guess  Reagan's kid  Yeah  Ronnie Reagan  Yeah  Was it  Yeah  No  No  George Bush  He had daughters  George Bush Sr  George Bush Sr  But  That lived in the White House  I mean  That lived in the White House  That lived in the White House 
[03:07:30]  Long, long ago  Are we talking like  It's Kennedy maybe  Like John John  Well John John  Jesus  What's that about  Why is it always daughters  I know  It's weird  It's so strange  It is kind of strange  I never thought about that  Conspiracy  Yeah  And they're all  Conspiracy  They're all left handed too  If you do the research  Most of  Most presidents  Are left handed  For some reason  Oh  Isn't that interesting  There is some sort of  Conspiracy  Who was the last  Right handed president  Last right handed president  Probably  Probably Whitmore  From Independence Day 
[03:08:00]  Whitmore  Yes  Doesn't that work  A different side of your brain  Or something  That's probably why  It does  My daughter  We think is left handed  She's two  She's just started  Mail to the chief  We think she might be  The next president  Because she's left handed  Because she's left handed  That's always a sure sign  That's all you need  And if you're ambidextrous  Forget about it  Now  You're apparently a problem  To the first family  I am a problem  I'm  Skip is  He's seven years  In college  Didn't graduate  He  He started some 
[03:08:30]  Major problems  For his  His father  And he's very  He's not very  Accountable for his actions  And it causes him  Some trouble  The media always  Media's always chasing  And that's the beauty  Of the show  The show is  Essentially a family show  About an ordinary family  In the most extraordinary  Bubble imaginable  They live in the White House  Got a 24 hour media news cycle  Following their every move  And it is  It's incredible  How much  You know  Of that will change  What you do  And how you do it 
[03:09:00]  So that's  The fun of the show  I do recall  Years ago  Even though I am  A child of the 80s  Yeah  I recall the days  Of Billy Carter  Who was  Just an embarrassment  I do recall the days  Of Billy Carter  Yeah  It was an embarrassment  To the Carter family  And even back then  And this was  Before the press  Really was just  On everything  24 hours a day  They did report  On some of the  Wacky hijinks  Of Billy Carter  Oh yeah  He was great  I can only imagine 
[03:09:30]  Now  Billy had no influence  He had his own beer  No influence  How great is that  Billy Beer  They named up beer  After the president's  Drunk brother  I love him  You think Jimmy Carter  Is like that  That is great  I don't think  He liked that  But it is  I mean it's amazing  Because it's  You are under  The scrutiny of this  And I actually  Did an interview  With Jenna Bush  The other day  And it was  Very cool  To just talk  To a first child  And like  Is she pretty  She really is  She's beautiful  She's pregnant now  She married  She's pregnant  Well I hope 
[03:10:00]  She's married  She's pregnant  Jesus  That would be awkward  We expect  What kind of world  Do we live in  So yeah  That's pretty cool  Yeah it was very cool  Yeah so  No influence  From Billy Carter  Or anything  Is that whole  There's influence  There's influence  From everybody  Yeah yeah  You take from everyone  It runs a gamut  Of first children  And relatives  And I stole a little bit  From everybody  You guys stole a film  In the season  No we're done  We did 13 episodes  And the show airs

[03:13:00]  It's not really me as Wozniak  That's me  Me being an asshole  That's me being an asshole  That's hilarious  See that's why we need the visual  I know  I know  Point it out every time  This is me as Wozniak  Wozniak in the 80s  Let me see  Wow  You look like Jack Black almost  Pass that around  That's right  That's what I was going for  A mixture of Jack Black  Oh wow  That is a Wozniak  Jack Torrance  Right before I went on  The Axe Murders  With the apple  Colored apple  But I think it's  I think the movie's gonna be 
[03:13:30]  Pretty great  Holy fuck  You look like him  Yeah  The journey that we took  Is pretty amazing  And I had known a lot  About Apple  Only as a customer of Apple  I never really knew  Kind of the story  Of these two guys  And this amazing journey  That they went on together  To create this behemoth  Of a company  Yeah  And I think it's  Really fascinating  Do you have a picture  With Obama?  I have a picture  Of Obama  Not with him?  They took a picture 
[03:14:00]  The White House  Takes their own pictures  And then they send it to you  Like the president signs it  So they haven't sent it to us yet  But here's  Damn them  I know  It's a group picture  Or one-on-one  A one-on-one  I got a one-on-one  I wouldn't accept a group photo  No I wouldn't accept  A group photo either  They initially said  We're gonna take a group photo  And I said  No you're not  No they didn't say that  Josh I got a picture  With Clinton  I got a picture  With Clinton too  Okay  So you got two presidents  I got two presidents  Damn it  That was him  In the screening room 
[03:14:30]  Which was  It looks like  The Hall of Presidents  The Hall of Presidents  I'm trying to relate  It's like the Hall of Presidents  Do you want me to take your phone out  And take pictures  No  I'm not supposed to  The Secret Service probably  Will come and confiscate my phone  And kill you  Like you said earlier  Yeah they're gonna hurt me  But  It was  So cool  And just to be in the screening room  Yeah  Like the next best thing I guess  Would be the bowling alley  Yeah  There  That's pretty badass  Yeah it was pretty badass  Wait so  Where were you allowed  That the average person  Wasn't in the White House 
[03:15:00]  Besides the screening room  Well we went  They gave us a tour of the East Wing  They gave us a tour  No one gets to do that really  I don't know  That's like the residential side  The residential side  Yeah  Nobody goes up to  Like his home  Sure  Portion  But we got  Just a tour of like  All where  He does everything  What's the East Wing  Like what's there  That you saw  That was pretty fascinating  Well I mean the coolest was  The area where he gave the speech  On Bin Laden's death  Which I have a picture of  Bill Pullman  Standing in front of there  Doing a set  Now here's an interesting tidbit 
[03:15:30]  Bill Pullman might be the only  Actor  To ever screen  Two movies  Or two things  Of himself  Playing the president  For two different presidents  Because he also screened  Independence Day  For Bill Clinton  That's the hallway  That's the hallway  That's pretty cool  This is the East Room  Which is  Nice pano shot  Yeah  Pretty remarkable  He used my panorama  On my phone  Technology rules  You didn't go up  To see the Obama's bedroom  Or see where like  The little upstairs bathroom  Well I did  I snuck up there  But I wasn't supposed to 
[03:16:00]  Jesus  Take a black light to the bed  To see if anything closed  It was  Oh god  Oh god  I know  It was  That's my president  I'm not the one that snapped  Illegal pictures  In the White House  That is true  It really is true  I have respect  I feel  I feel very vulnerable now  But it was very  It was very cool  And I stole a couple of napkins  Just while  We're confessing to everything  Yeah  You probably would be  Very tempted to 
[03:16:30]  You know  Get a fork or something  What a great experience  Anything with that White House  He's using the  The Lincoln Bible this weekend  He's using Martin Luther King  And Lincoln Bible  Oh he's doing two  Doing two Bibles  Stack of Bibles  The actual Bible  That Lincoln used  Which I guess  He did right  Yeah he used that  Back in 2009  He's using  He's actually using  Daniel Day-Lewis' Bible  Oh okay  See that  He's not using the original  You're funny  It's a little  You're funny  A little weird  Where does that Lincoln Bible go 
[03:17:00]  When they're not using it  Every four years  It's probably Smithsonian  Yeah  Or just in like  A little like  Inauguration pile  For presidents  That would be great  If it had that little slot  In the back for the card  That just goes into the library  Right  Yeah  Stamped  Or gives it to his daughters  Somebody  Play with  Stick figure flip movie thing  In the corner of it  Frrrr  Frrrr  Yeah  That would be disrespectful  Yeah  A little bit  Just a little bit  Disrespectful  That's alright  And Biden's swearing 
[03:17:30]  On his family Bible  Which has been in his family  Since like the 1800s  Really  Who cares  Who has a family  Think of how many  Old curmudgeons  Have read that  Right  Say  Get around  A lot of  Bidens use that  Yeah  But stop competing  With the Lincoln Bible  You're not going to beat it  No  He's trying to do  His own thing  Well how do you beat that  See if it were me  I would do something  Just random like  Gerald Ford's Bible  Right  Right  Or Jimmy Carter's Bible  Right  This is the Bible 
[03:18:00]  Taft  Some presidential  Nobody's Bible  This is James K. Polk  This is James K. Polk's Bible  Polk  Spiro Agnew  Knocked this Bible  Off a table once  I'm going to swear on it  He didn't use it  Yeah  He just knocked it  Off a table  Angrily  This was the Bible  He was angry as  He was cursing God  Due to his erection difficulties  Fuck  Why don't we  Why don't we start  Wrapping up  Because it is
