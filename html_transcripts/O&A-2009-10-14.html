<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a discussion of "Whip'em Out Wednesday" and a positive interaction with a fan.  This segued into a conversation about swine flu, with one host expressing a desire to contract it.  A caller, Brian from Buffalo, introduced the show to the concept of a "garbage barge" sexual act. The hosts then discussed a haunted house, its length, and scariness, with anecdotes from staff member Sam and a mention of a previous sideshow performer.  The conversation took a serious turn with a discussion of the 9/11 attacks, sparked by a documentary, "Secrets of 9/11."  This involved discussion of governmental failures and missed opportunities to apprehend Osama bin Laden, with input from a caller identifying himself as an FBI agent, Marvin.

The show then briefly covered Chuck Liddell's elimination from "Dancing with the Stars," before returning to the 9/11 discussion and the inadequacy of the government response, touching on racial profiling in the context of terrorism.  Numerous listener calls followed, covering the "garbage barge," haunted houses, a show called "Swimming with Sharks," Arnold Schwarzenegger scolding his wife, and the death of Al Martino.  The segment was punctuated by crude humor, sexual innuendo, and offensive language.

The next segment heavily featured offensive attacks on Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, contrasting them with Louis Farrakhan.  The hosts used derogatory terms to describe Sharpton and Jackson, discussing their perceived hypocrisy and lack of accountability, referencing Rush Limbaugh’s commentary and a school fight in Chicago.  A caller questioned their lack of response, leading to discussion of a past incident and a secret deal.  The hosts also vented their frustration at XM Satellite Radio for celebrating Bob Edwards' anniversary while seemingly ignoring their own, with a listener highlighting the disparity in airtime.  A tangent involving Quinnipiac College’s alleged warning about David Letterman and past female interns ensued, interrupted by a call from Long Island radio personality Randy Spears, leading to a satirical discussion of the “Best Of Long Island” contest.  Jimmy was mentioned as being present throughout this segment.

The following segment focused on a critique of the Memphis radio show, Maney and Riley, using a 74-second clip to illustrate their perceived blandness.  They discussed Halloween costumes, "slutty" costumes, and the difficulties in choosing a unique one.  A significant portion mocked the Bacon Brothers, speculating on Kevin Bacon's motivations.  A clip of Maney and Riley discussing a new Michael Jackson song, highlighting Riley's unfamiliarity with Paul Anka, became a recurring joke, accompanied by sexually charged and offensive comments about Riley's appearance.  A caller's late period led to a "freaking out" segment, followed by a call back revealing a negative pregnancy test. The segment concluded with highly offensive mockery of Captain Chesley Sullenberger and his book, fueled by listener calls, and ended with a crudely edited phone sex clip and a discussion about a Delaware Cub Scout suspended for bringing a camping utensil to school.

The penultimate segment began with a discussion of a child's overturned school suspension and zero-tolerance policies, followed by stories about men arrested for possessing child pornography.  The conversation then shifted to a lengthy, contentious debate about jazz music, featuring numerous profane comments from the hosts and callers, interspersed with playing jazz music from artists like Miles Davis and Harry Connick Jr.  Tangential topics included a midget race and a racial slur found on a store receipt.  The segment concluded with a call from Patrice O'Neal, who shared his dislike of jazz music; Bob, a French horn player, also briefly attempted to join the broadcast.


The final segment depicted a prolonged and exasperated reaction to an unexpected extended jazz music break.  In-studio guests Patrice O'Neal and Larry King joined Opie and Anthony in expressing extreme displeasure with the music,  marked by frantic attempts to stop it. The hosts contrasted the jazz with the music of the Beatles and Frank Zappa, the latter's discussion including a graphic anecdote about his fear of doctors.  The segment concluded abruptly with the hosts cutting the music short.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Let's get this show on the road on this hump day.  Happy hump day to everybody.  Yes.  Whatever the fuck that means.  Hump day.  Is anyone still calling it that?  Nah.  Nah.  Well, I'm sure the Jocktober shows are.  Yeah.  But nah.  Nah.  We're bringing back Whip'em Out Wednesday.  More and more wow stickers are making their way out there to the streets of the United States of America.  I saw a vehicle this morning as I was cruising down the expressway. 
[00:00:30]  Wow sticker.  Very dark tinted windows.  So I kind of pass him and then he drives up next to me with his window rolled down.  I kind of put his arm out the window like, hey, how you doing?  Yeah.  And then I just proceeded to do about 90 miles an hour past him.  Left him in your dust.  But he, yeah, fan of the show.  I had a sticker on there.  It was nice to see.  Nice to see.  Right on.  And I think we're running a promo still.  How you can get your wow stickers.  I hope so. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Although I heard they ran out, but I think they ordered more.  We ordered more.  We got more wow stickers, Danny.  That's good.  Can I have one of your papery snot rags, please?  There you go.  Sneave on it for you, yeah.  Tissue.  There you go.  Just want to.  Sop up some mucous membrane.  Yum.  Yum.  Yum.  You got the swine flu.  Well, yeah.  Yeah.  I just figured I'd bring it in and give it to everybody.  You know, the panic of getting the swine flu.  Worst of the swine flu.  Has everybody in a tizzy? 
[00:01:30]  I want to be the first person to admit that I just want to get the swine flu and get it  over with.  You just want to get it?  I just want to get it over with.  Then you'll be immune to it.  Yes, because we're all going to get it, and every time I have a sniffle, a cough, a scratchy  throat, liquid diarrhea, fucking whatever.  Yeah, you're like swine flu.  Right.  Here it is, finally.  And then I wonder, wonder, wonder, no, I guess it's just the cold, so then I'm waiting for  this swine flu thing that inevitably most of us are going to get this year, and most  of us will do just well with. 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  Most people just get it.  It's like anything else.  Yeah, I mean, a few of us will die, but, you know, people have been dying since the  beginning of time.  Apparently.  I think so.  I just want to get it out of the way.  So if you have it, just find me and just cough in my face.  Really?  Yeah.  Just hack right at you?  Well, the wondering is what kills you more than just getting it. 
[00:02:30]  What is this?  Let's go to Brian in Buffalo.  Brian, what's going on?  Buenos noches.  Hey, boys, last night this girl had this guy, she led a motorboater for his birthday,  and he turns her over on the table and he gives her a garbage barge.  What's a garbage barge?  Oh, Jesus.  It's where you stick her face in your ass and you go...  You've heard of the garbage barge, Jimmy?  I never have, no.  It rhymes.  Garbage barge.  It's like doing a motorboat, but with the girl's ass? 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Garbage.  Oh, my God.  It's kind of funny, though.  Jimmy, I loved the line yesterday.  Huh?  I loved the line yesterday.  You're half a person.  I spit my coffee out.  I don't remember what I said, but thank you.  When we were talking to the sideshow guy?  Oh, okay.  Maybe?  Yeah.  Okay.  I want to go to that haunted house that he talked about.  Boo!  Ah!  Ah!  Oh, maybe I don't.  Scary!  Did you like the sideshow guy yesterday?  I did, but that haunted house sounds really good. 
[00:03:30]  They run...  It's like a three-hour trip through it.  No, it's not.  That's the line.  No, but the trip through is also a long time.  It's not a three-hour trip, Jimmy.  You'd be scared out of your mind.  I would be.  I don't like being scared.  They would have to take you to the hospital.  You can't be scared for three straight hours.  It's a hayride.  It's three different haunted houses.  Two.  Two.  Sam went through it.  It's three.  I bet you're wrong.  It's three, and it's also a hayride, and three haunted houses, and a sideshow.  The haunted houses. 
[00:04:00]  Haunted haunted houses.  I want to go up there.  The line is three hours, though.  Is it really?  I think so.  But is it like a better spooky world?  That's why I don't go to those places.  Sam said it's great, though.  We were at the best.  Why go to any others?  What was that?  Spooky world up in Massachusetts.  Yeah.  I remember that.  I don't go to those haunted houses, because I don't feel like waiting around for hours  on end.  Yeah.  I was walking through one time, and the man jumped out, and he had on this outfit, and 
[00:04:30]  I went, ooh.  It's very scary when it's all pitch black, and someone just goes, ooh, right in your face.  Oh, very frightening.  This is in the woods.  He's in a cornfield.  It's very frightening, because they're not allowed to touch you.  Just tell the person, you can't touch me.  They walk up to you, and it's very scary.  Get away from me.  You're not a ghost.  Very scary.  I'm scared of the spooks and goblins.  Yeah.  John Shaw was all right. 
[00:05:00]  Was that his name, John Shaw, yesterday?  Yeah, he was good.  With his weird beard, and his, I mean, the eyelid trick was good.  Move.  He hung fucking hooks out of his eyelids, and then stretched them out a little bit as  he was hanging a paint can full of water from his eyelids.  Is it a three-hour fucking trip through the haunted houses and the corn maze there, Sam?  The whole thing, yeah, it takes like two hours to do the whole thing.  Fuck, you were right, Jimmy.  Well, no, you weren't right.  You were almost.  I like the way you said, yeah.  Like, you said it's three hours. 
[00:05:30]  You went, yeah, it takes two hours.  Yeah.  I mean, it could.  You actually know that, Sam.  That means Jimmy was two-thirds right.  But the lines aren't that bad.  The really bad line is the beginning of the thing, because you have to, like, order your  tickets online, and then go and wait online to pick them up.  Mm-hmm.  But.  Doesn't sound.  If you just go to the side, like, Jess and me just went to the side of the line.  Oh.  And just kind of jumped in.  We waited for like ten minutes.  Yeah?  Yeah, people don't like that.  No, the people behind us were really pissed off.  Yeah, why wouldn't they be?  You cut the line. 
[00:06:00]  Yeah, we did.  We did.  I hate people like you.  You wouldn't cut the line, though?  Well, when I have an opportunity, I certainly do.  Yeah.  But then when it happens to me, I'm very, very pissed off.  You know what it is, though?  It's just another part of Sam's culture.  What?  It's my culture.  Yeah, line cutting.  You ever been to Great Adventure?  Yes, I've been to Great Adventure.  Let me tell you about the line cutting that goes on there.  We just cut that one line.  I've never been to Great Adventure.  Do they cut the line there?  Oh, it's horrible.  It's a Great Adventure just getting out alive. 
[00:06:30]  Hate that place.  Why would you go to Great Adventure?  It's the scariest part of it.  I would always get dragged there by some broad that wants to go on the roller coaster.  I want to go.  And you sit there.  They actually get on, I swear, probably two roller coasters in an eight-hour stretch.  That's not worth it.  It's standing on lines for hours on end being assaulted by criminals.  Ruffians.  Yes.  How the fuck are you being assaulted? 
[00:07:00]  Come on.  By a look.  You got to go early.  Really?  Go early.  Mentally assaulted.  So I'm not doing the haunted house thing.  Why?  I want to go.  You want to have to wait on the line?  You want to have to, because they have screen passes.  No, that's great.  But then you feel guilty as you're walking past everyone.  Guilty?  I swear to God, I can't do that.  I feel fucking guilty.  Because they'll think you purchased a screen pass.  Yeah, that's true.  Because you can buy a line-cutting pass.  You can?  Yeah.  How much extra?  It's like $25.  But they'll give you one for free, I'm sure.  $25 extra to cut the line? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, we didn't buy that.  We just cut it.  But then you have to wait on the line of line cutters, right?  Yeah.  I mean, I guess so.  So how do you not wait on that line?  Cut them.  Another $25?  Just walk to the side.  You have to wait in line to get in each house.  So once you're off, you're off.  Once you get off the hayride, you have to wait on line.  Again?  But then after that...  Oh, my God.  I mean, it's like a short line after that.  And then through the houses, you don't?  It's like you have to wait on a line to be scared every room. 
[00:08:00]  Oh, look.  This is the headless man.  There's a long line.  Actually, the third house, it takes like 15, 20 minutes to get in.  But that's because the line moves so slowly because nobody's paying attention to the line  because John Shaw is performing right in front of the line.  So everybody's watching him and not realizing.  Oh, that's not smart.  Go.  There's a whole bunch of people.  Was it scary?  It was scary.  Did you go, ooh, a few times?  Yeah, I jumped.  What was the scariest thing that happened?  You were walking through with the lovely Jess and what happened? 
[00:08:30]  Well, because the thing is, sometimes you think, oh, it's just, it's a dummy.  It's just, sometimes it is.  You rock.  It's like, ooh, I'm at work.  This is scary.  Every one of us just was like, all right, let's do this one.  Jess hates the chainsaw people.  Yeah, yeah, that's a big one.  But they don't have any chains on them.  But Jess points out what happens if they accidentally forget to take off the chain. 
[00:09:00]  Yes, that'll happen in a movie.  Yes.  And so, and that's true.  And I reminded her that could easily happen.  Yeah.  Just so she could get really scared.  Or that somebody.  And grab you tightly.  Somebody crazy could sneak in and pretend to be an actor.  But in actuality, they're a real killer hanging out in the haunted house.  Haunted houses suck.  No, not this one.  Usually they do, but this one sounds good.  I'm not going.  You're not going.  I am going.  No one's going.  Let's all go as a show.  No.  Why would I go?  I'm not waiting on no stupid line. 
[00:09:30]  You don't have to wait on line.  That's a fun idea, actually, as a show if we all went.  All of us.  We did that.  When?  Oh, we did it.  It's a spooky world.  This is better than spooky world.  This is a better crew.  Well, then we're walking through the haunted area.  Because they didn't even have a house.  It was just this haunted area.  Oh, sorry.  Like this weird place would be haunted.  And in the middle of everyone getting scared, there was a fan that said hi to us.  I'm like, could you just scare us?  Please?  It was some guy who's dressed up like as a vampire.  He steps out a character and goes, oh, love your show. 
[00:10:00]  And he had, like, fake teeth in and stuff, so you could barely hear him.  He's like, open it up and I love your show.  I was like, thanks, buddy.  Take us right out of it.  Thank you.  You know what?  We're here to be scared, so do your job.  We do our jobs.  The only thing that took us out of it was when we went to the last house, somebody in a wheelchair  was before us, and so they let him in, and there's this part of it where the walls are  like air is blowing it and it's nylon, so it feels like the walls are closing in on you 
[00:10:30]  as you go through it.  But the person in the wheelchair got stuck, and so one of the monsters came out to scare  someone, and the guy goes, look, my sister's in a wheelchair and she's stuck, so the guy  took off his mask and helped her.  There you go.  You're out of it.  You're out of it.  Wait, what was she stuck in?  He should have just went and yelled, boo, boo, boo.  He should have screamed scary stuff at her and tipped her chair over.  That's what a monster would have done.  Can you imagine if he had just tipped that fucking old turnip legs over on the floor? 
[00:11:00]  Throw her in a pond.  There's a monster stepping on my sister.  She's in a wheelchair.  He's kicking her and yelling worthless things at her.  Well, if she can't feel nothing, you might as well.  Exactly, just kicking her legs.  Making fun for everybody else.  He was a very scary looking monster before he took off his mask and it was just some  goofy teenager.  Yes, exactly.  I'm fucking not going.  Just some white kid.  I'm not going.  Why?  It's fun.  It sucks.  It doesn't suck. 
[00:11:30]  I think it's just fun.  Oh, somebody's scared.  I think so, too.  Yeah, that's me, Sam.  He's frightened.  He's scared.  Yeah, that's me.  He's frightened.  That's real goblins.  That's what Bob Eatman does for money around the holidays.  He just comes out and talks to people.  Oh, my God.  There's a real dead person with a briefcase.  He's not aggressive enough.  House is haunted with boredom.  Fucking latke's priest brother of his.  Yeah, they should do a little something something.  Oh, yeah.  October should be their favorite month of the year. 
[00:12:00]  When's that ghoul coming into town?  He's coming in soon.  Today.  Is it today?  Is it today?  I read your email.  Yeah, today he's going to be in here.  I did.  I didn't know if it was today or tomorrow.  Yeah, he's going to be in today.  We've got to get Jonathan not on the phone on the show.  It was maybe this week or something.  Because he was away.  He was in a war zone.  Who?  Oh, Jonathan?  Where'd he go?  Bad place.  Where?  Somalia?  No.  Afghanistan?  Your manager went to Afghanistan?  What's he doing there? 
[00:12:30]  What's wrong with him?  On vacation.  Just, hey, this is fun.  Him and his big fucking mule.  He's a thrill seeker.  I don't know why he does that stuff.  He just wants to go and...  What did he say about it?  Yeah, what is he doing?  I haven't talked to him yet.  Is he looking for bin Laden?  Is that what he's doing?  I don't know.  He probably said,  I heard there's some good hiking in Afghanistan.  I decided to hike in the mountains.  Yeah, the mountains are really nice.  And they're mined.  So you never know if you're going to blow up.  All right.  Get away from that terrorist thing, man.  It's some beautiful hiking trail. 
[00:13:00]  It's a beautiful country there.  Let me tell you.  I know you said that when you leave the airport.  Right.  You went in the airport.  Yeah.  You're in traffic.  You can get security with you, but...  I would...  Yeah, yeah.  You're just in traffic.  Just walk up in.  In traffic.  In a place where you're in war.  Yeah.  Yeah.  With a war going on.  Might not like Americans too much.  I, uh...  Oh, boy.  Did I see a show last night.  I hate these shows, but I'm compelled to watch them these days.  9-11 shows.  This was the secrets of 9-11. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  The secrets of 9-11.  And it wasn't, uh...  It wasn't your run-of-the-mill conspiracy show.  It was pretty much all backed up by fact, and it was just the cavalcade of government  fuck-ups from the original 9-11 basement bombing with the truck all the way up to and past  the, uh, uh, 9-11, uh, airplane attacks.  And, uh, just...  You realize, yeah, this was just the government completely dropping the ball on intelligence. 
[00:14:00]  Like, they knew some of these guys were terrorists.  They had these memos that said that people were going to use planes as missiles.  They didn't know where exactly, but they weren't sharing, uh, information with each other.  FBI and CIA.  Yeah.  And then, and then goddamn Clinton administration.  Holy shit, did he get off the hook with this one.  He had probably four instances where he could have killed Osama bin Laden. 
[00:14:30]  And the plans were laid out, ready to go, and the last minute, they all sit in the White  House briefing room and throw shit back and forth and go, well, there might be a little  too much collateral damage.  He's here.  We know he's here.  But then they saw some plane from the United Arab Emirates on the runway of this, uh, camp  where they were having some kind of falcon, uh, competition that, uh, Osama bin Laden is  into.  And a lot of Middle Eastern guys, they do this falcon hunting and he was there and the 
[00:15:00]  whole camp.  And they plan on just bombing the fuck out of the camp and killing this guy.  Cause at this point it already bombed the embassy.  Uh, and, and, and I mean, they really knew this guy was into some heavy shit.  At that point when, when 9-11 happened, I knew it was Osama bin Laden.  So by then we all knew who he was too.  People knew his name.  Yeah, that's true.  And CIA, FBI knew who he was.  Like I said, they weren't trading information, but like in four instances, then they had the 
[00:15:30]  predator drones that saw him.  They saw him.  He's in this white robe, tall guy, uh, surrounded by people where he was supposed to be.  And they didn't launch, uh, hellfire missiles because the CIA, the, uh, CIA and the military  were arguing over who would have to pay for the predator if it crashed or something.  So it became this big red tape bullshit story and, uh, scrambling jets.  That was another thing. 
[00:16:00]  The FAA never was, was, uh, uh, told the military.  Three instances, the, the two, uh, into the trade center, the one into the Pentagon.  And then no one decided to call the military because the one guy that was supposed to do  it at the FAA wasn't available.  And they're like, there's only one guy that could call the military and actually get things  going.  Why wasn't he available?  Exactly.  What are you doing?  And people would go, man, because, man, because it's a conspiracy, man. 
[00:16:30]  You know what it was?  It was just a complete breakdown of governmental communications and policy and red tape and  bullshit.  Maybe he didn't want the responsibility of calling in a strike on civilian airliners.  Dude, they played a clip of, uh, guys from the FAA talking to each other and someone said,  we got another plane.  Uh, and he, and he goes, uh, uh, you think we should scramble some jets on this one? 
[00:17:00]  And the other guy goes, I don't know.  Uh, I'll have to get back to you on that.  And the guy goes, we're going to have to do this within the next 10 minutes.  And the guy goes, uh, I'll get back to you.  That's a tough decision.  No one ever gets back to anybody.  The only, that's the easiest way to get around something.  Yeah.  It's just don't pass the buck.  We've seen it here on the show.  Everyone does it.  And then Cheney, uh, uh, gave the, the shoot down order for any future planes, but he didn't 
[00:17:30]  have, he wasn't the one that is able to do it.  Only the president can do it.  And Bush said he had done it when in fact, there's no record that he had given that order.  The only fighter that ever got an order to, uh, take down one of the planes was directly  called by the, um, secret service and told to get in a plane at a Langley unarmed F-16,  this guy.  And if he saw a plane coming, he said he was going to ram his F-16 into the plane and try 
[00:18:00]  to eject out at the same time.  Oh, he was going to like, yeah, he was like, yeah, send it at it.  Try to actually hit him while he's in it with a wing, try to sheer off a wing and then eject  out.  He goes, if I could, but it was unarmed.  It was the only plane available that that was that close.  Jesus.  And, uh, that was the plane that was taken down in, uh, uh, Pennsylvania.  So wait, he was going to, uh, he was going to hit the wing. 
[00:18:30]  Why not just get, I guess if you got too close and just ejected.  It might miss.  And the explosion might get you because the big plane blowing up.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So he wasn't going to use the fuselage.  He said he was going to use his wing and try to sheer off an engine or, uh, with the tip  of the wing and then, uh, eject out because he had no, he had no weaponry, but all these  things, it's called, yeah, the secrets of nine 11.  And instead of it being this big conspiracy thing, it's just what you see.  The government screwing up.  You see people on the roof of the white house looking up going, where are the fighters? 
[00:19:00]  And you know what?  It just was a total communication breakdown.  That's just another story, man.  Man, you're a gatekeeper.  We're truthers.  That's just another.  Shut up.  You want to be a character.  That's just another angle, man.  Man.  People forget too that that whole incident happened in a very short period of time.  People didn't, it wasn't like the military was a military attack.  You know, it's like the first two hit within what?  First one they thought was an accident.  Yes.  Some people didn't, but most people thought it was an accident.  The second one, then they tried to get in touch with the military, but I mean, they flew 
[00:19:30]  a couple of planes from, I believe it was Florida or something.  Maybe, maybe Virginia.  I'm not sure, but it was too, it was much too far.  One was up in Massachusetts and it would take like 30 minutes for them to get to Manhattan.  Well, fuck.  Why can't we do that then?  Yeah.  Well, I want a 30 minute fucking plane ride.  Get an F-16.  Zipping around with a hunk, flying it.  Oh, wow. 
[00:20:00]  Good show though.  And it was like two parts.  One was the part before 9-11 and it showed the Clinton administration, all those fuck-ups.  He sent cruise missiles in that just missed them.  And then he had so many opportunities to take him out.  Did he bomb an empty base at one point?  No, they were going, they were going to kidnap him too.  They knew where he was.  They knew it.  They said this guy, Bin Laden, was just this kind of a, he had a blue collar lifestyle. 
[00:20:30]  He'd grab lunch.  He'd go into the village, talk to people, come back.  And then after these missile attacks, that's when he started like really keeping on the DL.  But they had a plan where they also were going to send in, they had trained a bunch of Afghanis to go into this camp and physically kidnap him and take him to the United States.  They trained, they did everything.  Again, last minute in the White House, they had this talk about, well, how many people do you think are going to die during this? 
[00:21:00]  And somebody said, look, when these guys bust into this camp, there's going to be a lot of gunfire.  People will get killed.  And they went, oh, well, we can't have that.  Another one, he was staying at the mayor's mansion in some savage country.  And they were just going to bomb the shit out of this mayor's mansion.  And they're like, well, how many people are there?  How many people just work there?  And it's like the old, you know, somebody even said, you lie down with the dogs, you get fleas.  Well, true.  It's like if you're welcoming this fucking terrorist into your home, hey. 
[00:21:30]  Tough shit.  Tough shit for you and everybody around.  But again, they showed him.  They sat at that table.  And the politics, yip, yip, yip, yip, yip.  And they went, no.  But knowing what they know now, they probably would have just bombed the shit out of everything.  Well, the thing is, they knew what they knew then, which was this guy was financing huge terrorist plots,  killing goddamn hundreds, if not thousands of people at embassies, suicide bombing, setting up training camps. 
[00:22:00]  They knew what the fuck this guy was doing.  They just didn't know the extent of what he would finally do.  What channel is this on?  This was on one of those Discovery.  Discovery, History.  It's probably History.  I think I was watching a whole bunch of weird, like, Afghanistan 9-11 stuff yesterday on History Channel.  Yeah, it's so fucked up to watch those.  What's the name of it?  Because people are just tuning in.  Secrets of 9-11.  Secrets of 9-11, if you want to check it out.  You sit there and watch it, and you're kind of going like, ah, come on, figure it out. 
[00:22:30]  You know they don't, though.  I know you know they don't, but you're like, God, he's right there.  Come on, just fucking get him.  I hate knowing the end.  Yeah.  Knowing the end of the story.  Yeah.  Very good.  That's a fun one.  All right.  Last night, we lost our hero.  Chuck Liddell was eliminated from Dancing with the Stars.  And Mars sent out an email in the middle of the night, so he's very upset.  We should get Mars in here to discuss Chuck Liddell leaving. 
[00:23:00]  They didn't like his.  Dancing with the Stars.  They didn't like his guyish smile.  I think they.  His guyish.  He made it pretty damn far, though.  Yeah.  He made it pretty damn far.  Did he get any better with his later performances?  Who the fuck was watching that show?  I know.  We all said we'd watch for Chuck Liddell.  Did we, though, in the end?  No.  You could YouTube his performance.  That's all you need, Eclipse.  Yeah.  You're going to watch an entire fucking waltz?  No.  Or Watusi? 
[00:23:30]  I mean, the girls aren't even that hot.  Everyone goes, well, but the dancers.  Yeah.  They got big fucking thick legs.  They got big, thick gymnast legs.  Dancer legs.  They're always dancing.  They got beautiful faces, and then they're built like a fucking  fire hydrant.  The proverbial brick shithouse.  Yes.  Who needs that shit?  Not me, I tell ya.  Well, where is Mars to talk about that?  We'll get him on the air.  Mars.  Marvin in D.C.  He's an FBI agent.  Marvin Nash?  Marvin.  Got a promotion. 
[00:24:00]  Hello, Marvin.  Hi.  Hi.  I just want to say to Ant, you know, it's easy to look at what's going on  with the lack of communication in the FBI and the CIA.  But the truth is, the FBI is bound by the Constitution and the laws of the United States.  Yep.  The CIA acts freely.  And though they have information, they can't always give it to us, and we can't always act  on it, because they get it through methods which, to us, don't stand up in court, and  which are illegal.  Yeah.  You know what, though? 
[00:24:30]  There was a breakdown in communication, and everybody was saying there was just this policy  of not sharing information.  Yeah.  They got territorial about stuff.  Yeah.  They got very territorial.  I mean, the CIA, at some points, did share information with the FBI, but shared it in such  a way that it wasn't put on top priority lists.  They didn't share it with the FAA or the people that are in charge of terrorist watch lists, which  we had at the time. 
[00:25:00]  Well, these guys, two terrorists, known terrorists that were part of the 9-11 plot, flew in to  Los Angeles under their own name, with their own visas, and meanwhile, they were known terrorists  that were said, hey, we got to look out for these guys.  Yeah, but you got to understand, we get information all the time on individuals that you look at  it, and you're like, well, this doesn't mean shit to me, but how do I know it doesn't mean 
[00:25:30]  something to somebody else?  You don't know unless you take the time to actually sift through everything else.  Just because it means something to you all say, it doesn't mean anything to you all say.  Are you FBI, sir, or CIA?  He's FBI, yeah.  FBI, okay.  Yeah, no, I understand that.  I'm just saying, from watching what I saw last night, there was a huge wall between the  two organizations where there could have been more cooperation, and I know that after 9-11,  Bush did put in place kind of a liaison between all the agencies, and the information got back 
[00:26:00]  and forth a little easier.  And there is much more communication now, but the truth is we have two completely different  goals, where if the CIA is looking to flip someone, make them a source instead of a target,  or just kill them altogether, we can't do that.  We're bound by the Constitution, so we have to elect them.  I understand that, but the second the CIA realized that these motherfuckers were in the United  States, that information should be passed to the FBI, where they can then do what, you know, 
[00:26:30]  they got to do to make sure these guys aren't up to any shenanigans.  That's right.  You know, CIA Director Chip Dudley said that they were being stonewalled.  All right, Marvin.  Thanks, Marvin.  Thank you.  Ant's watching 9-11 documentaries.  Yes, secrets of 9-11.  And I'm getting very upset because Coach Moe threw himself on the sword last night and  got kicked out of the Biggest Loser. 
[00:27:00]  Wow.  We were watching very different TV last night.  Yeah, very different television was going on.  Not Coach Moe, I said to the TV.  Not Coach Moe.  Let's say hi to...  And while you guys were doing that, I was performing brilliant.  Leon, Leon, Red Eye.  Red Eye.  I thought you said you were performing...  What did we learn?  The garbage... 
[00:27:30]  The garbage barge?  The garbage barge.  Yes, I've done it on Gutfeld.  I gotta remember that.  You did it to Gutfeld, sure.  I did.  I took his little short legs and put them up on the table and gave him a good garbage  barging.  Right in his small buttocks.  Who has a really smelly hiney?  We gotta do the garbage barge today.  Gee, I don't know.  Daniel?  It's gotta be just horrendous.  Danny's asshole has gotta be the worst thing in history.  His farts are terrible.  Yes.  Too bad Tibby Tom's not alive.  Kenny's in bad shape today.  He farted before, and man, did that stink. 
[00:28:00]  Was that really him?  Oh, yeah.  He's like a lactose intolerant Doberman.  His farts are always like that.  It's like giving a puppy chocolate.  Garbage barge.  Garbage barge.  We gotta get that done today.  NYPD checking in.  Mike, North Carolina.  How are you, buddy?  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  I remember that when, you know, that right after the hours fell, it must have been around  three, four in the afternoon.  It was so fucking eerie because that's when the fighter jets started circling Manhattan. 
[00:28:30]  Yeah.  And, you know, I mean, I, you know, I lived in the city my whole life, you know, but it  was, it was so fucked up to think that Manhattan was a fucking war zone, you know?  Yeah.  Like, it actually got to us, you know?  Yeah.  And, you know, all these FBI guys, they could, you know, talk a lot of shit about, oh, we  can't do this and we can't do that.  You know what?  When the government wants to kill someone, they'll kill them.  You know?  Well, apparently they could have and they should have, but they didn't. 
[00:29:00]  They were so worried about collateral damage and keeping these relationships with these  people that are harboring the terrorists.  I mean, it was a bunch of shit.  And now, you know, you see these people on TV saying it was all bullshit and the government  and this.  How can these people even live with themselves by saying that shit, you know?  All these people that are crying about the war now, listen, you know, I want this war  to end just like everybody else.  My son-in-law is going to Afghanistan next month. 
[00:29:30]  But, you know, on 9-11, you saw all those people on West Street screaming for blood.  And now you got the blood and now they're screaming that, oh, we don't want it anymore.  And you know what?  Listen, war sucks.  I was in Beirut.  I was a Marine when they bombed the barracks.  But you know what?  You pull out of Afghanistan now, every one of those guys that died over there died from  nothing.  And you know what?  It all starts all over again.  That's why Obama's having a...  I mean, we're lucky now that it's caught these guys that were going to bomb the tunnels and 
[00:30:00]  the trains.  Yeah.  Anyway, I'm punching out guys.  Take it easy.  All right.  All right, Mikey.  That's why Obama, you know, he's under the gun to get 40,000 troops that they're asking  for.  And he goes, oh, you know, well, I'll decide that in the coming weeks.  Meanwhile, I think these guys need some help right now.  Yeah, but he just got the Nobel Peace Prize.  Yeah, send some troops in now.  But he got it for nothing.  It's already confusing.  He can't, like, send 40,000 more guys to war as he's accepting the Nobel Peace Prize. 
[00:30:30]  Watching those shows last night.  What a fucking farce.  What is wrong with this world?  Watching that show last night, I could not believe that eight fucking years later, we  have a president named Barack Hussein Obama that, by the way, also, this was new to me,  he appointed two staunch Muslims to Homeland Security.  Who did?  Obama.  Obama.  One of which was in, like, what is the equivalent of the NAACP for Muslims? 
[00:31:00]  Like, really making up rules for the government, like, we want to be treated like this, and  this is bullshit, and stop doing this.  Who would, imagine back then, right after 9-11, saying, yeah, we're going to have this  president, and he's going to point Muslims to Homeland Security.  There was something on the news recently where they had a bunch of Muslims protesting racial  profiling. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah.  This is right after they got this guy who has been flying, who was the guy's name,  Quasi, whatever the guy that they just arrested?  Quasimodo?  No, not that guy!  He could fly hunchback.  There's only one Quasi.  No, whatever his name was, the guy.  There's actually another Quasi out there.  No, I'm probably wrong on his name.  He's the guy that everybody's talking about right now.  Right.  And he's Afghan.  And we're like, well, this one guy's like, I can't get a job, and the reason the FBI  targeted him, or somebody targeted him for investigation, was because the guy had spent  the night at his house.  Yeah.  And it's like, well, sorry, motherfucker. 
[00:32:00]  A guy who's arrested and plotting a 9-11 type plot is arrested.  What do you think?  How do you not expect?  Racial profiling works!  It does work.  God almighty!  Especially!  You assholes!  Especially in this day and age when it comes to terrorism.  When they're looking for Klansmen, do they talk to Muslims or Jews or blacks?  No!  Yeah.  They either go to...  They go...  Of course, I said they talk to Anthony.  They go to Anthony's house.  But you know who you're targeting.  Yes.  Bunch of fucking white crackers.  Yep.  God almighty.  Let's say hi to Greg. 
[00:32:30]  Greg, what's going on?  Greg?  First and foremost, you don't sound sick, and you come in with your 9-11 rant.  Come on, buddy.  Let's save it until next year.  Ooh!  What?  You do not sound sick either, sir.  I gotta put that out there right now.  Look, how do you know what kind of sick I was or am?  Exactly.  I sneezed before the mics went on, my friend.  You should see what he was jerking off to yesterday.  He's sick.  Did you finally get sick?  Did I what?  We didn't hear you, Greg. 
[00:33:00]  Oh, and then he hangs up.  Greg.  Greg.  All right.  Let's say hi to Cassius.  Cassius!  Hey, guys.  Hey, Cassius.  Speaking of jerking off, last night, you know, that TV show Swimming with Sharks.  What is that show?  It's on Channel 7, when that ridiculous, or maybe it's after the pile of shit dancing show.  Pile of shit dancing show?  That pile of shit dancing show does incredibly well in the ratings. 
[00:33:30]  Smear each other with feces, tub girls in it.  Just shows you where we're at as a nation, that a show like that does very, very well.  But go ahead.  Swimming with Sharks.  Yeah, the shark show is where people propose, they're trying to get money from like four  or five wealthy, successful business people.  But you might want to look for clips.  There was like this young woman and her middle-aged dad or elderly dad, who's been a vet for like  40 years, and is trying to sell some pet food idea to them. 
[00:34:00]  But she's got huge knockers, and she's showing them off.  The dad brings her in with him, you know, to like sex up the whole idea.  Just great cleavage.  All right, we're going to try to find the picture.  Guy's just looking for tits.  Well, why not?  He loves tits.  Why not?  Thank you, Cassius.  Yeah, can you put me on hold?  For what?  So I can continue listening? 
[00:34:30]  Pay for the fucking service.  Get satellite, you motherfucker.  Come on.  All right.  Come on.  I'll give you 10 minutes.  How's that?  Thank you, man.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  10 minutes of commercials as we take our first break.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  What is this?  We're rocking.  I don't know.  It's All My Life, Foo Fighters.  I like this.  Oh, it is.  Foo Fighters.  What is Foo?  You'll never get to that. 
[00:35:00]  Huh?  You'll never get to that.  Oh, that part?  No, I know, I know.  There it goes.  Here, let's go to Skip.  Hey, Arnold Schwarzenegger scolded his wife.  It's big news today.  The world's falling apart.  So was Arnold from the pictures that were showing up on Drudge.  It's about fucking time he falls apart.  Jesus Christ.  Not a poor bastard.  He held up pretty good, considering.  62 years.  62 years old.  Oh, he is.  Still had some muscles. 
[00:35:30]  Muscles into his 60s.  Yeah.  Who knows what he was fucking taking back in the day to get the big muscles.  It's flubber now.  He's got flubber.  He's got a lot of flubber.  That's the curse of lifting a lot.  You get the flubber later in life.  Ah, so I hate to digress, but I watched a lot of television.  Saw a show on MTV where some people that weren't happy with their bodies after they lost weight.  Right.  And one guy had so much skin on his body, it was a walking freak. 
[00:36:00]  Yeah, you got to cut that shit off.  But, like, you got to wait for years before you cut it off, and then you got to lose weight.  And he'd wrap himself up in, like, this girdle thing.  Well, Big Kev had the extra skin cut off.  Yeah.  Good old Big Kev did it.  They took his head with it accidentally.  Big Kev went through that.  It's a very dangerous surgery, I believe.  They say you trade the hanging skin for massive scarring.  Oh, it is massive scarring?  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I got to kind of, like... 
[00:36:30]  Oh, God.  Well, you would go with massive scarring.  Yeah, you would.  Wouldn't you?  At least in a shirt.  Yeah.  It looks bad to begin with, but at least in a shirt.  Oh, at least in a shirt, you look presentable.  Yeah.  You just have sex with your shirt on for the rest of your life.  Do we have any scarring pictures?  Like, what people look like after the surgery?  No, we don't, Jimmy.  But only in hats.  You're not allowed on the internet.  In hats.  I liked him in Milwaukee Brewer hats.  Dan, go.  He couldn't even...  This guy couldn't just put on a shirt or clothes.  He wrapped himself up in, like, these big ace bandage things. 
[00:37:00]  That's not a bad idea.  Because his skin was flapping, but he's crying that,  I got to do this.  It probably makes him fall over because he's, like,  not stable on his two feet.  Smelly bandages.  Arnold Schwartz...  You didn't even ask why Arnold Schwarzenegger scolded his wife.  There's a big story today.  I already know why.  Yeah, she was on a cell phone.  That's a no-no in California.  Oh, driving?  He signed a bill and everything, and she violated the bill.  She violated the bill.  She was driving and on a cell phone. 
[00:37:30]  Yeah, because that's what people do.  No matter what, you're on your cell phone when you can.  They can make all the laws they want.  We're going to continue talking on our cell phones when we drive.  What do you think he would do?  What do you think people would do if he actually had her thrown in prison?  That would be great.  Federal prison.  It's so easy these days to just put it on speaker and kind of just hold it next to the window.  Like, you could drive.  You don't have to have it right up to your head.  You know, you could just kind of hold it by the steering wheel and, whoa, it's like Bush. 
[00:38:00]  You're showing, like, vagina, huh, Danny?  Danny's got before and after some surgery there.  That's not bad at all.  It's not bad, and that looks like fresh scarring.  Yeah, that's fine.  That's more a tummy tuck.  That's a tummy tuck, though.  That's someone that lost a real lot of weight.  Should I get a tummy tuck?  Yeah, absolutely.  Oh, why would you?  Yeah, you really should.  But, I mean, I want to lift it all so where it's right below my neck and on my shoulders.  Like a shelf. 
[00:38:30]  I want to have a fat shelf below my chin so I can put my beverages and chips.  Right there.  That's handy dandy.  Well, we lost one of the great ones in entertainment overnight, too.  Oh, no.  Yeah, the Celebrity Death Watch continues.  Oh, Jesus.  2009, the year of the Celebrity Death.  Who is it?  This is a biggie, Ant.  A biggie for all you Godfather fans.  Oh, no.  Wait, let me think.  For all you Godfather fans.  We lost a biggie.  Salazzo!  Oh, tell me James Caan.  We lost a biggie, Jimmy.  Nah, we'd have heard James Caan. 
[00:39:00]  You are wrong.  We'd have heard James Caan.  It's obviously not Pacino.  It's not Duvall.  It's not Talia Shire.  From the Godfather.  I'm thinking the actor that played...  Was it Abe Vigoda?  No.  Abe Vigoda will never die.  That would be huge.  Clemenza's already dead.  That whole Abe Vigoda joke is so old now, too.  John Cazale, yes, he is dead.  I said my guess was Salazzo.  No.  Brando's dead.  I'm going to say Carlo. 
[00:39:30]  Carlo?  No, you fuck.  I fucking hate your guess.  You fuck.  Of course it's not Carlo.  I laugh at that every so often.  Jimmy's mom just called him, you fuck.  You were her clumsy little shit.  I know.  Any more guesses?  Any more guesses?  Any more guesses?  I'm going to guess the guy who played Johnny Fontaine, Al Martino. 
[00:40:00]  Oh my God, give yourself a bail!  He's 82.  Johnny Fontaine.  For my godfather.  Wait, you weren't guessing you were reading it.  Of course I wasn't.  You cheated.  I didn't even know he had this.  You fucking cheated.  Yes, I did.  You just cheated.  You thought I pulled fucking Al Martino out of thin air?  Al Martino's dead.  And you just discovered that we have like stories in front of us?  No, but I didn't know that this was one.  I was just living through casually.  You fuck.  Take that bell back, motherfucker.  You fucks.  Fuck.  Yeah, Johnny Fontaine died at the age of 82. 
[00:40:30]  Aw.  Actually, his real name was Al Martino, who was a fine singer out of South Philly, I believe.  South Philly?  He had a lot of hits.  Volare was his.  Travis, give me Al Martino's biggest hit.  You can act like a man.  What's the matter with you?  That's his biggest hit, when the godfather smacked him.  Smacked him in the face.  His bitch fucking crying face.  Here we go.  Here's the big hit from Al Martino.  This is a hit?  Wise men say.  A horrible version of this song. 
[00:41:00]  He wrote this originally?  No way.  It's a cover Travis found.  Travis finds the worst fucking covers.  This is him singing the song.  Shut up.  He's singing it at an office party.  Wait, is he known for it?  Give me the fucking name.  I don't think he's known for it.  I don't think he's known for it.  You want Spanish eyes?  Well, I think he at least wrote that one.  Did he write anything?  I don't know if he wrote this.  No, he's more known.  Play Volare, Travis, before I go in there and yank your fucking pubes out.  He was the Volare guy?  Yes.  He's a croona.  Nothing worse than a croona. 
[00:41:30]  A croona.  A croona.  It's a dick.  All right.  But you and I have our love always there to...  Oh, this is like my grandma's music.  This would be playing...  Oh, what a verse on him.  What a voice.  Yeah, but he was in The Godfather.  Yeah.  Someone give me the daily news.  Please.  Pass it over.  Thanks, bitch.  Oh, it's Disco Volare.  Wow. 
[00:42:00]  Count, count, wow, wow.  Ladies and gentlemen, Dan Haggerty taking the dance floor.  Dan Haggerty.  Celebrity Disco Night on NBC.  No, that was the Chips episode.  Yeah, I love that one.  Maybe he did write Can't Help Falling in Love.  All right, here we go.  Here we go.  Al Marine Martino is known for hit songs including Here in My Heart, Spanish Eyes, Can't Help Falling in Love, and Volare. 
[00:42:30]  I don't think he wrote them.  Sorry.  Volare stinks.  Oh.  You don't like it?  Oh, stupid car.  And he sang in the 1972 film, title score, The Love Theme from The Godfather.  What is that love theme from The Godfather?  Have I seen the daily news?  I didn't read it yet.  Oh, but you threw out my newspaper.  There it is.  Give me that!  All right.  Give me it.  Everyone just yells at each other here.  Where's the chocolate?  Travis, we've got to play Brother Joe's Godfather song going into break in honor of the passing of Al Martino. 
[00:43:00]  Johnny Fontaine from The Godfather.  What?  What's the love theme from The Godfather?  He sang that and I don't know what it is.  Do you want to hear it real fast?  I'm curious, because I know that the opening music is great, but that's certainly not him.  Is Uncle Paul here today?  Because we're getting more info from David in Rhode Island.  David.  Oh, hi, David.  Hi, guys.  What's up, man?  I love that Al Martino.  He had a lovely voice.  What a way about him.  Al Martino, famous for playing Daddy's Little Girl. 
[00:43:30]  Played at every wedding.  Yeah.  That's a strange thing.  Sure.  My wife and I used to love that song.  Oh, Larry.  We used to listen to that before she was estranged.  All right, guys.  Fuck you up, man.  Stranged.  Over lies told about me.  What kind of lies, Uncle Paul?  There was a bunch of...  I was doing security work.  Yeah.  And off the parkway.  Yeah.  And I saw some youngsters stealing some items. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah.  So I was searching their shorts.  Because that's where they hide them, right?  I says, where's the cheese doodle?  I got in there and I got him out.  And the father hit me.  Oh, see.  Not my false teeth out on the bedroom floor.  I thought you were only 50.  How old are you?  57 years young.  57 years young.  I'll be 58 in March.  You lost all your teeth already?  Yeah, I've had a few misunderstandings.  Oh, okay. 
[00:44:30]  And I don't like brushing them because my gums bleed.  Jesus.  Did he get mad at the father, Uncle Paul?  No, he got mad at me.  I was like, there's a big misunderstanding.  And I get in the car and my wife says,  Paul, your teeth is bleeding.  I said, I know, don't talk to me.  God damn you.  He gets in a lot of misunderstandings.  I'm a big fan of angry Uncle Paul.  Yes.  A lot of people are a big fan.  Yeah, that came out with my ex-girlfriend 
[00:45:00]  because Uncle Paul would only be selfish with the treats.  Whenever she'd have chocolate, he'd be like, let me have one.  And if she didn't hand it over, he'd be like,  give me the chocolate.  Get off.  He's very selfish with treats.  Hey, you guys remember baby Jessica?  Oh, of course.  She fell down to a well.  That's right.  The stupid one with that stupid scab on her forehead.  How many years ago?  18.  No, 22.  Stop reading. 
[00:45:30]  No, I'm not reading.  I'm not.  22 is the answer.  Yeah, I meant to say 22.  And one more of these.  Is she getting married?  I don't know.  Just 22 years ago today it happened.  What's older?  Winnie the Pooh or Roger Moore?  They're actually the same age.  Which is older?  I'd say Winnie the Pooh.  You would be correct.  Yeah, Winnie the Pooh's some old shit.  But here's the deal.  Winnie the Pooh debuted 83 years ago today.  83.  Roger Moore debuted 82 years ago today. 
[00:46:00]  It's old.  Winnie the Pooh's a piece of shit.  Yeah.  You weren't a big fan of the Winnie the Pooh thing?  Can you be?  Fat little body.  I never really got it.  No.  What was it about?  It was like, you know.  Woo!  Woo!  Woo!  Kids.  Tigger.  Oh, Tigger.  I need some honey.  Exactly.  Oh, do you?  You know what that means, huh?  Yeah.  And Tigger.  Well, figure that one out.  I don't think there was some ball funneling going on. 
[00:46:30]  Of course there was.  That's what honey was a fucking code word for.  Of course.  I need your asshole sweat.  Of course.  Pretty cum.  Yeah.  Put some honey on my chapped-ass lips.  Delicious honey.  Wonderful.  I don't do good impersonations.  I used to shrine people with booby.  What kind of impersonations, Ted?  Oh, Tigger!  Oh, that's pretty good.  I like that.  That's Winnie the Pooh.  That wasn't supposed to be Winnie the Pooh, you idiot.  That was Yogi Bear. 
[00:47:00]  Winnie the Pooh.  All right.  We move into some harder stuff here.  Sharpton.  What the fuck is Sharpton doing?  River now.  River now.  I guess Rush Limbaugh has decided he needs to buy a football team.  Yeah, he's got so much money from having Obama as president.  His rating's very good.  Of course they are.  It's the best thing that happened for his career.  Yeah, yeah.  He knows that.  He was secretly hoping that Obama would become president. 
[00:47:30]  You know that, right?  Yeah, why not?  He needed Obama to be president.  A lot of cash.  Rush Limbaugh is remembered through the Clinton years, especially.  Yes.  Bush years, not so much.  And now Obama again.  He's in the news every other day, this Rush Limbaugh.  Yep.  That's where he made his bones.  So now he wants to buy the Rams.  And Reverend Al Sharpton and what?  Jackson?  Who else?  Now why?  The reverends are getting involved.  What the fuck is their problem with this guy wanting to conduct business?  What's the problem with Rush Limbaugh owning a team? 
[00:48:00]  According to Sharpton's little letter, he didn't think that it was appropriate because he's done some anti-NFL thing.  And this is what you have to love Sharpton.  He said that Rush Limbaugh has said divisive things.  And Jesse Jackson said that he's made a living preying on the fears of white people.  That is what these two sacks of shit said. 
[00:48:30]  They're both complete pieces of shit.  They're both complete morons.  If you don't like Rush Limbaugh, at least he does get up and work every day.  I don't know what these two fucking assholes have done their entire careers except stir the racial pot so they can get their faces on television.  Let's go to the tape here.  Rush Limbaugh has, down through the years, been one that has been less than unifying about the NFL. 
[00:49:00]  In fact, he has demonized the NFL.  Why would the NFL reward someone who once said that the NFL is beginning to look like the Crips and the Bloods without weapons?  Because they were.  Does this guy understand entertainment at all? 
[00:49:30]  This fucking Al Sharpton?  You're a guy who accused a prosecutor of making a duty on a girl's tits.  Yeah.  Right.  Fucking asshole.  Scraping racial epithets on her.  That's a great line by Rush Limbaugh.  That is a funny one.  Meant to be funny, entertaining, a bit shocking.  Bloods and Crips without weapons.  Who cares if he made that response?  That's pretty fucking funny, man.  I wish I came up with that line.  Ooh, then don't let him buy a team.  And the Bloods without weapons.  Yeah, so?  There's a quote. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah?  Yeah.  Who said that Donovan McNabb was given quarterback because they needed a black.  Now, this kind of record of divisiveness in the...  Well, you know what?  This guy talked...  If you know anything about sports, there is a lot of pressure to hire, you know, black coaches and get certain black players.  It's like...  Give me the Greek said.  Well, you can't win with...  It's like...  There is a pressure. 
[00:50:30]  Everyone knows it.  And they want...  I think they want minority owners to be...  So for Sharpton and the other fucking Susan Sarandon and I, jackass, it's okay for them to say we want blacks here.  But if Rush Limbaugh...  It's all about his politics.  Yes.  That's all it's about because he's a fucking conservative white guy.  Absolutely.  And they don't like it.  And talk about divisiveness.  Reverend Al Sharpton is probably the most divisive asshole in this country.  Why would...  But here's how he should be talked to. 
[00:51:00]  Shut up!  Yeah.  You're a pig!  Shut up.  What's your job?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What's your job?  Did you ever pay Steven Pagonis?  Yeah.  Or do other people hand over that money in your name?  You suck.  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Have you paid your fucking taxes?  Huh?  Have you done that?  Have you paid your fucking fines from all the bullshit you've been in?  Hey, Jesse, before I answer, we talk about this.  How about the girl who falsely accused the Duke students of rape and you said that even  if she wasn't...  They didn't rape her, you were going to pay the tuition. 
[00:51:30]  Did the Rainbow Coalition pay a tuition?  And your eyes are big.  Go.  Yeah.  Go.  And go.  Nice gay porn on my mustache.  Go.  And go.  No one understands what you're saying.  It's not like you're talking with fucking accommodation of Swahili and Bell's Palsy.  Go.  You're having a stroke every sentence.  I ain't even having it here.  Go.  Your turn.  Asshole.  Ah, shit.  I'm getting the feeling you don't really like the guy.  I have no respect for either one of them.  Yeah.  They're not genuine.  I tell you what, I'm telling you.  A guy like Farrakhan, I respect and I like because he's not, even though he really says 
[00:52:00]  some fiery, awful shit, he's not a clown.  Like, these guys are clowns.  Yeah.  These guys are fucking...  You can't pin all this stuff on...  They're jokes.  They're jokes.  In the community.  Especially when you look at the inconsistencies in their own public and personal lives.  With Farrakhan, you can't find that.  You can't sit there and say to Farrakhan, what about that time you...  Yep.  You're not going to find that shit.  And Obama sat down with Reverend Al, right?  I don't know.  Probably at some point.  Didn't he sit down before the election?  Yeah.  Why would...  A little sit down with Reverend Al. 
[00:52:30]  Here's the rest of the Reverend Al there.  This kind of record of divisiveness in that sport.  He has the right to say what he wants to say.  No one argues that.  Oh, really?  But you're going to cast your aspersions on that sport, and then the NFL is going to...  He's insane.  Yeah.  Was that what Rush was doing, or was he trying to fucking tell some jokes?  Or form an opinion, yeah.  I've listened to Rush Limbaugh over the years, and guess what?  The guy does like making jokes.  And to say that there haven't been a lot of criminals in professional football is a little 
[00:53:00]  off base.  So Rush Limbaugh puts it in a way that has a little humor to it.  What's wrong with that?  And why can't you cast aspersions?  You can't make a couple of remarks criticizing him at the NFL.  Sharpton criticizes the government, and he can't keep his fucking fat face out of the government.  He's trying to run for the Democratic nomination.  Right, right.  So I guess if you cast aspersions on something, you can't be involved with it? 
[00:53:30]  Then you can't be involved.  Shut the fuck up.  Oh, shit.  Language.  He's an ass.  What?  But you're going to cast your aspersions on that sport, and then the NFL is going to  even seriously consider giving you a stake in that sport?  Yes.  I don't think so.  Oh, boy.  That's thin.  That's thin.  He's got nothing.  What a thin story.  He's got nothing.  Because he wants to say it's race.  He wants to play that race card so bad, but he really can't go full blast with it. 
[00:54:00]  And you know what?  Fucking Rush Limbaugh, I'm not a huge fan of his, but I'll tell you this much.  He ain't going to fucking sit down and take any shit from Reverend Al Sharpton.  No, no, no.  He already remarked on it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He ain't taking shit from this guy.  Yeah.  He's commenting.  Reverend Al, you're way, way over your head on this one.  Because Limbaugh has a giant radio audience.  He'll destroy you.  And, uh...  He'll destroy you and your stupid podcast.  Where is this show heard?  I don't know. 
[00:54:30]  Is it on one of the satellite channels?  That probably is.  Who the fuck is it?  Remember when What's-His-Name had to kiss his ass?  Ugh.  Who?  You know who.  Oh, the old...  Yeah, they don't work for the company anymore, but someone had to go and kiss his ass.  And, um...  Ugh.  Jesse Jackson...  I like this guy.  He's good.  By the way, he decided he was going to ride the bus with the students from, uh, Finger  or Finger, what is it?  Finger High School in Chicago, where there was that fight where that young gentleman was  beaten with a board. 
[00:55:00]  Yeah.  How did white people do that?  I'm sure we did it, but how?  Yeah, I don't know.  How did we orchestrate that?  How that's, uh, you know, uh, Whitey's responsibility.  But, uh, he's trying to, you know, silence the violence and, you know, he's getting his rhymes  in there.  Of course he is.  Uh, and this is being blamed on the fact that they closed down a school, uh, and opened  it as a military academy.  So the kids that went to this, uh, one school before they closed it now got shipped over 
[00:55:30]  to this other school, and there's this rivalry where they kill each other.  Instead of just accepting new students into a school and, like, human beings, uh,  uh, going to school and not killing each other, there seems to be this war.  And now, uh, uh, Jesse is blaming it on the fact that they closed down the school and made  it a military academy.  Like, like you should keep the schools separate because if they put them together, you're 
[00:56:00]  accepting the fact that they'll just kill each other?  Yes, that's, I knew why people were to blame somehow.  It's because they put a military academy in and they should have known that the students  would do nothing but fight and eventually murder each other with a board.  You're right.  Exactly.  White people and the, and the, uh, the school board should have known that.  That's the problem.  And another thing that, uh, of course, I always get a big kick out of is, um, they're saying  that they have to do something about the, all the gun violence in Chicago.  Uh, by the way, you can't get a gun in Chicago. 
[00:56:30]  You can't, it's, it is illegal no matter how good a person you are to legally own a gun in  Chicago, you're not allowed.  You can't.  So what more, how do you get more gun control after none, none guns, none guns, and now there's  some problem where they have to fix that.  None guns plus one is more better.  I just, yeah.  That's one more better.  One more better.  What is happening?  Is it guns are being filtered through? 
[00:57:00]  Shut up.  Yeah.  Filtered through and brought into the community by the people that are in the power.  You don't see the people bringing guns in or liquor, liquor stores and cigarette stores.  Shut up.  I like to have sex out of wedlock.  Yeah.  How does he speak, Jimmy?  Like he has what and what?  I love the, I love the combo platter.  It's a combination of Swahili and Bell's palsy.  He's an asshole.  He's an asshole.  And the fact that, the fact that people are so afraid to tell this guy because he throws 
[00:57:30]  Reverend in front of his stupid name to shut the fuck up.  My dad was a Reverend, I think, and he didn't have to do nothing.  He was just trying to escape paying some taxes.  This Jesse Jackson's been playing this shit for years.  And the fact that anyone entertains him is an embarrassment.  I feel like we do our part.  What can we do?  Yeah, that's true.  We talk shit.  We just go on and call them all assholes.  Oh boy, do we talk shit.  Hey, good.  We better, we should start blogging.  I do blog.  That'll get the word out.  Blog?  Let's become bloggers. 
[00:58:00]  Hey, uh.  I know, I know.  Thank you.  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Okay.  Like, um.  I know.  Hey.  Okay.  Uh, Quinnipiac.  Quinnipiac.  Quinnipiac.  Yeah, Quinnipiac College, right.  They do the polls, right?  I knew some broad.  Went to that school.  But they do those polls, too.  They decide who the president.  Yeah, the Quinnipiac poll is very important.  They decide who the president's going to be way before we do.  How do they do, what the fuck makes him so special? 
[00:58:30]  I don't know.  They know how to fucking take a poll.  What, do they just ask people?  They send me out with notepads?  I saw the girl that went to that school, by the way.  She took a lot of polls.  Right in the shitter, right?  She didn't know how to take a poll.  Did she?  Right in the shitter.  When you saw her, did you fuck?  Did you fuck that?  We would fuck.  All right, be careful.  My finger, ka-dunk.  Right into the spongy mask.  Oh, boy.  It swelled up before her fucking hand was out of there. 
[00:59:00]  It was black and blue.  Shut up, you purple-handed bitch.  Look at this fucking asshole.  Lee in New Hampshire.  Lee, going backwards.  Lee.  Yeah.  Welcome aboard, Lee.  Thanks for calling the program.  Hi, guys.  Hi, Lee.  Hey, Anthony, I want to know, and Opie, I want to know why, um,  Hello?  Yeah, we're listening, Lee.  You're panicking.  Go ahead, Lee.  Sorry.  I want to know why, I mean, you guys pound Reverend Al all the time,  which is great, but, like, he never, ever, like, comes back at you. 
[00:59:30]  Is he scared?  I mean, what the fuck?  Let me tell you about Reverend Al Sharpton.  He actually did go after us.  Yes.  And he didn't get the job done, and then there was a secret deal made  by someone that doesn't work for the company anymore  to calm Reverend Al the fuck down.  After the Condoleezza Rice thing.  The Condoleezza Rice homeless Charlie incident got on Reverend Al's radar,  and he was raising holy hell with somebody that used to work for this company  before the merger.  And rumor has it they gave Reverend Al some time to calm him the fuck down 
[01:00:00]  because we were big stars for XM at the time.  I'll tell you one reason, dude, too.  I think that Sharpton or Jesse Jackson, it's funny.  I addressed a few of these guys in my book, and it's like, I was like,  eh, I'm not worried about anything happening because if you're hitting somebody  and you're being honest and you're not fucking trying to be soft,  it's almost like, go ahead, I want them to respond.  How can you challenge the fact saying that you fucking said Stephen Pagona shit  on a girl's tits and now you want to be a president? 
[01:00:30]  How could Jesse Jackson deny saying, hi, me, town?  Like, they can't deny this shit?  It's undeniable.  They push it under the carpet.  They try to make it seem like, oh, don't bring that up.  That's a long time ago.  I was misled by unscrupulous lawyers and people.  And it's like, I wasn't supposed to come to the aid of a young woman  that said that this happened.  I was misled.  But I, you know, shut the fuck up.  I actually thought that she had feces wiped on her, 
[01:01:00]  racial epithets scratching her,  and she was put in a plastic garbage bag by Stephen Pagones.  Why'd you say Stephen Pagones?  It was a name I found in a phone book.  I just decided.  Take that, Reverend Al.  That he's a white man and he must have done it.  And then they said I had to pay him money.  So I said, okay, and then I didn't pay him.  But that's what Reverend Al does.  Same thing pretty much with the government. 
[01:01:30]  Or anyone else that I owe money to.  But I wear nice suits now.  You know what?  No more jogging suits and medallions forever now.  I'm legit.  Too legit to quit.  Too legit to shit on a chest.  But that's why guys like that don't really come after.  Because when you're slamming them.  With honesty, by the way.  I would love to say that to Sharpton.  I would love to say that to Jesse Jackson.  So I don't respect them.  Right.  What? 
[01:02:00]  Answer, hi me town.  What would he say?  You're a fucking, you're a racist.  You're an anti-Semite.  You don't like Jews and you know it.  Yeah.  You don't like Jews.  I mean you, Anthony.  That was in the past.  Well, that's what I was saying.  No, but it's like that.  You could say it to Jesse Jackson.  What the fuck did he say?  He said he was good.  People don't call him out.  Hannity calls him out.  And people hate Hannity for it.  He's responded to that in the past.  But I don't remember what his response is because it's so inane.  Maybe his response was, I expect to be forgiven for things that I've said and still give it a position of power while other people shouldn't be. 
[01:02:30]  Because I'm a black man.  Yeah.  Let me say hi to Bear in Alabama.  Bear.  Good morning, guys.  Hey.  I just remember during the campaign when, well, I'm going to help you.  Remember when Obama, I mean when Jesse Jackson was caught on audio calling Obama the N-word?  He said nigger.  He said.  Yeah, we say the word on this show.  We've had it with saying the N-word, to be honest with you. 
[01:03:00]  We did our part and we kept it safe for a little while.  But let's talk like fucking adults here.  He said, I'd like to cut his balls off.  I believe he said that.  And then he goes, he's talking down to niggers.  That's what he said.  I don't think he called Obama the N-word.  He said he's talking down to niggers.  Yeah.  That's right.  Used it.  Exactly.  Excuse me.  And he used it, you know, as a collective term.  Yeah.  My thing is, it's not that he said it.  It's the fact that he's so fragile and they're so afraid that there's no accountability on their part because there's such a history of victimization that they're not allowed to be held to any kind of test. 
[01:03:30]  That's what makes me sick.  Well, I'll be honest.  I didn't like the fact.  I thought, and I like Fox, but I thought the fact that Fox didn't absolutely destroy him with that and point out his hypocrisy was a bad move by them.  And maybe they didn't do it for strategic reasons because they have something on.  I don't know why they didn't or it's just too inflammatory.  And you're right.  He was using it as a collective.  He wasn't like pointing at somebody and saying it.  But it doesn't matter.  The hypocrisy of that fucking bag of shit in his – and this is what Sharpton goes.  He goes, well, that's not the Jesse Jackson I know. 
[01:04:00]  Yes, it is.  That's the real Jesse Jackson, you dumb motherfucker.  Yeah, because he was off mic.  Yeah, because he was off mic.  Jesse Jackson got caught having an affair.  It's the same people that live their lives.  It's the same pattern.  The guy lives his life a certain way.  It presents himself on TV a certain way.  The guy got caught using the epitaph.  The guy got caught cheating on his wife.  The guy got caught in financial crap.  He's a phony.  You know, it's the same thing.  I hate your guts.  I loved it, man. 
[01:04:30]  Thank you, buddy.  It's the same thing as when you got these right-wing religious zealots that you find  out has a computer hard drive full of child pornography.  It's the same fucking thing.  It's a hypocrisy.  It's the real them.  And that was the real Jesse Jackson when he was leaning over whispering, you know,  I want to cut his balls off.  And nothing happened to him, by the way.  Of course it didn't.  A white guy in that position.  Gone.  Oh, my God. 
[01:05:00]  So fired from whatever he does.  Of course it didn't happen.  So fired.  Nothing.  Because, again, I'm telling you, I've said it a million times, and I apologize for being  redundant, people.  It is a sign of white people still really running the country.  The fact that they allow that type of fucking...  The fact that white people aren't up in arms about it, it really is a sign of being completely  in charge.  Because the parents never get as mad at the things the children say as they do.  Things Other Adults Say.  That's exactly what that is.  Let's go to Hydro.  Hydro.  You're next on the OVN. 
[01:05:30]  I think you're always on Hydro.  Hey, man.  Not much.  Now, I was listening...  I listened to the last part of that show yesterday.  It's on 169 The Power.  Yeah, great.  Power.  That whole fucking channel, by the way, was trying to get us kicked off the air.  And I, for one, never forgot that.  True.  So they could go fuck themselves.  I think they're terrific.  Their Saturday morning programming is marvelous.  Yeah.  But I believe he wanted to take a dab at you guys because he, you know, mentioned all these  shock jocks and the shit they say, basically. 
[01:06:00]  And I don't think he was talking about Rush Limbaugh right there.  But I kind of got an idea that he might have been talking about you guys right there in  that audio.  Then mention us by name.  Because we're not scared of stupid Reverend Al Sharpton.  Right now.  Thank you, sir.  The problem is, it's not even...  I don't even...  I honestly don't really hate Sharpton and Jesse Jackson.  I think they're boobs.  Because they're not the ones who do the firings.  They're not in a position of power to do the firings.  It is these fucking out-of-touch white executives who never have real conversations with black 
[01:06:30]  people.  They never have embalmment with a black person that's real.  No.  And that leads to what we were saying off mic.  Uh, we're looking at one of our TVs and there is fucking Don Imus on a channel that looks  very similar to MSNBC.  Yeah.  And he's interviewing someone that looks very similar to his old guest.  Business as usual for Don Imus.  Nothing happened to the guy in the end.  And if the fucking company would have just understood that and realized that, they didn't  have to go through those drastic measures and fire Imus like they did.  It's not... 
[01:07:00]  Because it's people who won't take like a really honest...  If a guy said something, you know, if Imus had dropped the fucking N-bomb on angrily  on...  Then he deserves to be...  There's a difference between that and what he did.  But God forbid fucking Les or any of the other guys over at CBS had just stood up for  him.  They just crumbled because they're terrified of blacks.  No.  Terrified of black people.  Well, there was some...  Ah, whatever.  There was some other things going on there.  Dude, you can't respect somebody...  There were some board members that...  You know.  Yeah, no, I understand.  The guy from the NAACP.  There was a guy who works at the... 
[01:07:30]  High up on the board of CBS, I believe, or was at Viacom who was with the NAACP.  He had an input.  Come on.  It's...  He had a major input on the whole thing.  Yeah, and they should have just said, look...  Fat, stupid Al Roker had input.  Oh, really?  The power is now an internet-only serious channel?  Ah, there you go.  Ah, ah, ah.  Did they lose it?  Good.  Good.  Not too much power there.  Dicks.  Really?  Actually, they call your channel the power anymore.  Yeah.  Not much power.  It doesn't take much power to have a channel on the internet.  You want to call it the... 
[01:08:00]  The shoulder shrug.  All right, we're going to take a break, and then I'm going to tell you what's going  on with this Quinnipiac college thing.  I already know.  I addressed it.  It's so stupid.  It's so dumb.  I addressed it on the television.  Oh, really?  I don't know.  When are you going to come to a taping writer?  Just come.  They have a new studio.  Like a fucking places to sit.  You know who's been...  They got a nice couch in them.  You know who's been reaching out lately is Mr. Hannity. 
[01:08:30]  I'm sure he wants to cancel me again.  They hate me over there now.  Mr. Hannity has reached out and really wants me to make that appearance.  He does.  And that's why I got my hair cut.  Oh, whoa.  Why?  When?  Just because it needed it.  Oh, yeah.  Oh.  Why don't you just do it?  I'm thinking of making my return to TV.  Why wouldn't you?  It's great promotions.  I don't like the fucking politics.  I'll talk other shit.  You know politics?  I want to be in like a play-by-play booth, making believe I know what I'm talking about  when it comes to a sport.  So, man, if you don't feel like you want to talk politics, just make fun of that. 
[01:09:00]  I want to be that guy.  Yeah.  Write down some things to say and then read them off a paper, obviously.  I'm a big fan of that wildcat thing.  Dude, why don't you do this?  Bring in quotes from your friends and then like say, well,  recording to my friend and then read it off a cue card to him.  It'll be great.  I like to just goof on the whole thing.  So, do that.  We'll see.  Hey, we're going to take a break and we're going to do the Quinnipiac thing and we're  going to do Jack-tober.  Yeah, we got a new Jack-tober.  I'm excited.  Are you? 
[01:09:30]  Love Jack-tober.  And what?  No baseball last night, I noticed, huh?  No.  No.  That's weird.  Why?  No baseball.  It seems like there should be a game every day.  I know, but they kind of, you know, they got through this division shit.  Now they're, you know.  And by the way, a big fuck you to XM Satellite Radio because they did a huge press release,  a big to-do that Bob Edwards has been with the company for five fucking years.  Are you kidding me?  And this is where all the anger and frustration comes from with this radio show. 
[01:10:00]  We started the exact same time as Bob Edwards and we're celebrating five years on Satellite  Radio.  And I guarantee we brought a hell of a lot more people to the fucking table than this  stupid Bob Edwards.  Dude, how do they keep talking about this guy?  Let me guess.  They did a huge press release.  Go to Orbitcast.  There's a picture of Bob Edwards and Mel Carman.  I think it's an old picture.  And it's all over the place.  Let me ask you a question.  And we sit here like, what about us, motherfuckers?  I'll tell you exactly what it is.  If the blame is here, it's because there's no publicist. 
[01:10:30]  I'm telling you.  Bob Edwards has a publicist?  I bet you Bob Edwards has somebody working for him.  Somebody working for Bob Edwards.  Renfield.  There you go.  There you go.  Big thing on Orbitcast.com.  Bob Edwards celebrates five years on Satellite Radio.  No respect.  I understand.  I just want this.  I just want a tiny bit of respect.  That's all.  That's all.  I'm not asking for the fucking world as far as respect goes.  But, I mean, it's everywhere in the Satellite Radio community that Bob Edwards, five years, 
[01:11:00]  five years, five years.  I'm like, what about us?  Five years.  Drop in the bucket for my lifespan.  Boo.  I'm Bob Edwards.  Tune in to me.  I come out of my coffin and do my show.  Then I turn into a bat.  Fucking ghoul.  Oh, he is such a ghoul.  Let it be known, he never did anything to us, but still.  No, of course not.  He's been very pleasant.  He's been a great guy.  You know, he just chases rats when he's not doing his radio show. 
[01:11:30]  Just eating rat blood and drinking.  Bites right into their backs.  His guests only agree to show up during the day.  Yeah.  Ah.  Hey!  He has to close the curtains.  But, I mean, come on.  Because they get confused down the hall.  Why the anger?  Why the frustration from that show?  It's things like this.  Why the...  Did they really say why the frustration from that show?  Yeah, I think they get confused.  Really?  It's a one-hour show?  Yeah.  They're celebrating the fact that Bob Edwards has been doing one hour for the last five 
[01:12:00]  years as, once again, the workhorses fucking do a little more radio than that.  It's all I could take is one hour.  One hour.  Gotta have somebody...  That means we've done two shows already today.  We've done two shows today.  Yeah, we've already done two Bob Edwards shows.  Because it's one hour with commercials.  Yes.  So that's probably 40 minutes.  40...  42 minutes.  45 minutes, maybe.  How do you get into anything?  One fucking hour?  I could do that in my sleep. 
[01:12:30]  NPR radio fucking stinks.  It really does.  I've listened to it.  It's horrendous, boring fucking radio that nerds like.  NPR, BBC, some of these cab drivers have that shit on.  It bores you to death.  It's fucking terrible.  The irrigation.  Shut up.  It's all just monotone babble.  Monotone babble.  Yeah, the delivery is all...  Monotone babble.  You can't even have a passion about what you're talking about.  It's garbage.  It's just kind of this monotone thing that they talk about. 
[01:13:00]  You know, we're going to talk about the budget that the highway department is getting this  year, which is coming out of our pockets, and hopefully it will solve some of the pothole  problems we've...  Holy shit.  What?  What?  I've nodded off eight times.  So, maybe Bob Edwards is really dead, and that's why it's impressive that he still does  a radio show.  Five years.  He's a mummy. 
[01:13:30]  Right.  That's why it's impressive.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Yeah, it's not even that.  We signed months later or months before.  It was pretty much the same fucking day.  Same time.  This dope that used to work for XM took me and Ann out to dinner to celebrate the fact  we signed with XM, and she couldn't even stay for the entree because she had to run  to a Bob Edwards celebration.  Boy, that made us feel good at the time.  We got someone big coming on board.  Like, who?  Big?  Wow.  Really?  Can't talk about it yet.  Can't talk about it yet, but the second we can. 
[01:14:00]  And obviously you think Howard.  And we're thinking something's going to be big.  They're like, fuck, they signed us and Howard.  That's crazy.  Something's going to be big.  And they go, can you believe who we got?  Bob Edwards.  Like, did I hear wrong?  What?  Did I just?  We just stared at her because I swear to you.  What?  I know a lot of personalities that I would never listen to.  I've never heard the name before.  Yeah, we started on the same day.  Same day.  October 4th, 2004.  I remember it.  Which was a Monday.  Like it was five years ago.  A Monday. 
[01:14:30]  They're showing footage of those guys who beat that gay guy.  Yeah.  We were talking about that.  You just got to fucking, you got to just kill people.  That's some fucking anger.  Yeah.  What is wrong with you?  We were talking about that.  I mean, if you're, if you don't, if you're not into, you know, people being gay and all  that, that's one thing.  But to be so fucking angry about it that you're, you're risking prison time and all sorts of  shit, that is fucking mental.  You beat the guy to within an inch of his life and in some cases kill people just because  they're gay. 
[01:15:00]  That is a giant problem that you have.  That is a huge problem.  The guys who do it are just scumbags.  And normally they're guys who, they'd probably beat you for another reason if it wasn't just  that.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, because you're white or because you're this or whatever the fucking reason is.  Yeah.  Because you're black.  Because they would find another reason to beat you because they're really just savage  motherfuckers.  The only way to handle guys like that after a videotape like that is if it's them, you  just fucking, you shoot them in the street.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  The guys that did that.  Just shoot them in the street.  But then we're stooping down to third world nations. 
[01:15:30]  No, we're not.  We're fucking cleaning up a problem.  Man.  Man, you know, then we're just as bad as them.  Who are we to judge who lives and dies?  Shut up, you liberal little fuckwad.  Go back home to your rich parents and your college.  Oh.  I don't know.  You took out my ass.  Who are you yelling at?  You liberal fuckwad.  We're just all yelling at everybody today.  I love it.  I fucking love it.  Angry.  Steven Connecticut did a little math for everyone. 
[01:16:00]  Yes.  I love when the listener does the math.  Five plus four equals nine, which makes me cum on my legs.  Five fingers, one bunghole.  I don't think Steve's here today.  I'm not really sure, though.  Really?  Hey, Steve.  What do you got?  Good evening, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  If they're making a big deal that Bob Edwards has been on the air for five years at one  hour a day, you guys have the 25 years equivalent. 
[01:16:30]  We should be celebrating your 25 years to take out a better session.  Let's really let this soak in.  Steve did the math for everybody.  It would take Bob Edwards 25 years to equal the amount of radio we did in the last five.  Five years.  And they're celebrating this fuck.  That's right.  And the irony is 25 years to equal the amount of time and 20 minutes to equal the amount  of quality time.  Hey, we didn't say.  But that shit's going to continue to happen if we rely on the company to do stuff like 
[01:17:00]  that.  It's got to be done from here.  I love Eatman, but he's not the guy to do it.  Now, he's good for radio agent shit.  He's not a publicist.  He's not a guy who's going to fucking push the show in the direction.  I'm sorry.  Two different issues.  I agree with you, but I'm telling you, this was a company thing.  It had nothing to do with Bob Edwards and his publicist.  You're probably right.  This is so a company fucking thing.  The company's never going to push this show.  For some reason, they're proud of a Bob Edwards, and they're not so proud of an Opie and Anthony.  Right.  That's why it has to be done from here.  And it's not a publicist. 
[01:17:30]  But for this show to get that, it's going to have to be done from this show's camp.  They're never going to do it.  Look at the way they're treating me.  Look at the way they're spitting in my fade.  They don't give a fuck about me.  They want me to leave.  This company doesn't give a shit.  You deserve it.  I know that.  Want to leave?  Nah, so I jerked off in the break room.  Everybody knows it.  Happy 25th anniversary, boys.  All right.  25 years in the business.  And then Brian did some math, too.  And he goes, actually, you guys are 30 days shy of five years because of that fine suspension. 
[01:18:00]  Ah.  Because someone who doesn't work here anymore had a fucking fold.  Oh, Hugh Pinero.  Yeah, I wonder if everybody fired.  Hugh Pinero folded and wanted us fired.  It's a fact.  And Eric Logan, who now works for Oprah, actually saved our asses.  That is a fact, my friend.  Fired from satellite radio for having a homeless guy speaking his mind on satellite radio.  That was supposed to be the whole thing with satellite is, hey, you're going to get stuff  you don't normally get on regular radio. 
[01:18:30]  And what did he do?  That was the only thing that saved the show, I think, in the end, was that it would have  been such a black eye on the entire...  A black eye?  No, eye.  Oh, a black eye.  Yes.  That whole suspension, we haven't talked about it much.  That took away a lot of fucking momentum we had built up.  Holy shit.  That pissed off a lot of fucking people.  And then these...  And, you know, there's a lot of people that never came back.  That's when I realized, wow, this fucking satellite thing wasn't what I thought it was. 
[01:19:00]  Right.  I thought that was the absolute perfect forum for a crazy-ass homeless guy to come up and  spout whatever the fuck he wanted to spout.  That's the freedom that this medium gives you.  You don't have the restrictions of the FCC.  You don't have this political correctness you got to adhere to because of the advertisers  and shit.  But then they turned around and just smacked us in the face over something that was completely  perfect for the platform. 
[01:19:30]  You know what?  Hugh Pinero completely blew it because then he's showing the business and the world that,  well, satellite radio doesn't really have the freedom you thought it had.  No different.  Which was so stupid on his part.  That was a real dumb move.  It's different now, by the way, that he's gone.  Believe me.  Yeah.  It is different.  Is it?  Yeah, yeah.  We've gotten some of our stuff back.  Oh, it's not, believe me, it's not where it should be.  But strategically, that was a dumb move on his part.  You're trying to get people to buy your service because it has a lot more freedom than regular 
[01:20:00]  radio.  And then what happens?  They suspend you, but regular radio said, no, we're fine with what those guys did.  We'll continue with them.  Yeah.  We continue doing radio.  A lot of people don't realize that.  We were off by nine every day for the...  Yeah, but we did those 30 days for regular radio.  Was that fucking nice?  It was wonderful.  And remember, for 30 days, they completely removed our names from the channel.  Absolutely.  It was just like, what are you doing?  We did three hours a day for a month of fun, completely ballless radio on CBS. 
[01:20:30]  Holy shit.  Yeah, I understand.  God, did that fucking suck.  Oh, in the end.  I'm so happy we're not on terrestrial radio anymore.  God, I fucking hated it.  In the end.  Can we say hiney parts?  We can't talk about poo-poo.  In the end, this is definitely a better place to be.  Without a doubt.  There was some strategy that was not done correctly.  As much as I hated the CBS lawyers, I will say there was a certain amount of integrity and 
[01:21:00]  fucking honor that they showed that I have not seen in other situations.  A certain amount of integrity and honor as guys to do business with that other situations  have not shown.  Yep.  Are you mad?  Eh.  Jackasses.  You're not mad, though, right?  I'm all right.  I'm all right.  I'm all right, too.  Shove a tissue up.  I'm all right, too.  Oh, Anthony.  You look like you got punched.  I'm all right, more. 
[01:21:30]  Ah, fuck it.  We made our point.  Everyone wants to talk about Bob Edwards and shit.  We don't dislike Bob Edwards.  Bob's fine.  We don't even know the guy.  No, he's a good broadcaster.  He just sucks the blood of other people to keep his youth.  He has to.  His headphones always fall off because he's hanging upside down.  We got to build a special studio.  He puts them on his chin so they go over his ears that way.  Blah!  Yeah, all the people that made those early decisions for XM are long fucking gone.  You know who emails me who I actually like?  Long fucking gone. 
[01:22:00]  Gary Hahn.  Yeah, he turned out to be a fan.  Yeah, he's a nice dude.  He'll email me.  Congratulations on the letter.  He's just a nice dude, man.  Oh, that's nice.  That's sweet.  Yeah.  I always email pictures of my cock and balls.  It's a little right.  Yeah, you have to.  Quinnipiac College.  We get into that story in some Jacktober next.  Stay there.  O.P. and Anthony, clear the phone lines.  We're done with this subject.  Clear the field.  I'm going to go. 
[01:22:30]  Ah.  Opie and Anthony.  What's older?  I'm going to play again.  All right.  Kiss releasing rock and roll all night.  Okay.  or, and this is where it fucks you up, Jimmy,  or Wayne Gretzky's first NHL goal.  Kisses up. 
[01:23:00]  Rock and Roll All-Night, I believe, was 77, so that's 32 years,  and Gretzky's first goal was 75, so I'm going to say Gretzky's first goal.  You would be correct.  I made that whole thing up with Gretzky's whole goal.  I have no idea what it was.  No, you're wrong, actually.  Wayne Gretzky, who, by the way, is Kevin Smith's favorite hockey player of all time.  That Kevin Smith on Twitter.  Wayne Gretzky scored his first NHL goal 30 years ago today,  and Kiss released Rock and Roll All-Night 34 years ago, Jimmy. 
[01:23:30]  Wow, really?  They're saying 19, that would be what, 75, I guess?  Is that right?  Yeah.  Oh, you know, I apologize.  Yeah, it's undressed.  I was thinking of Rock and Roll Over, the album.  No, you aren't.  What's Rock and Roll Over?  It's an album with Kiss.  I don't remember that one.  Rock and Roll Over, yeah, I'd love them, leave them on.  It's a great album.  See, that's you knowing too much about Kiss.  That was my mistake.  When you say release, you don't think song, you think album.  When I think release, I think, like, blob, blob over my hand.  I don't like being wrong! 
[01:24:00]  Oh, no, it's poor, spoiled brat Jimmy we have in the studio today.  He was yelling at Kenny about his cereal.  Kenny was getting really annoyed because he wasn't in on the bit.  He really wasn't in on it.  I don't want that cereal, I want this!  I told him what I wanted!  It's whiny, spoiled brat Jimmy.  It's not my name!  Oh, I'm sorry.  Princess. 
[01:24:30]  Quinnipiac College.  Oh, right, the poll.  This fucking idiot poll.  I guess the Late Show, Letterman, they get a lot of their interns from Quinnipiac College.  And what is it, the dean over there, Jimmy?  You did the story on Red Eye.  I don't know all the facts about this one.  I got the basics here.  One of them said that they're just going to examine their policy more carefully.  Was it a dean?  I don't know.  It was someone way up at Quinnipiac College.  Dean Wormer?  Didn't get his name.  Basically warning future interns to watch out for Letterman. 
[01:25:00]  Because, you know, he has a tendency of fucking the help.  He's a predator.  He's a predator.  No, he likes little shenanigans.  It's consensual.  Yeah, I think Quinnipiac College wanted to be in the news today.  Yeah.  Like Letterman is going to be touching and fondling interns from Quinnipiac College.  They'll send them off to, you know, Washington where they can be pages and have their asses pinched  and have these scraggly old congressmen berate them and use sexual innuendo. 
[01:25:30]  That's why we don't have female interns here because we know we can't keep our hands off  them.  I know.  It's terrible.  Fucking sexual harassment all over the joint in the old days.  That's what you do with...  Now, what's her name?  A cotton ball chick.  She was fun.  Jill was all right.  Yeah, she was good.  She works for Caroline's now.  She's got a nice gig.  She's got a nice gig over there.  Who else was cool?  What's something about a female intern we got? 
[01:26:00]  Remember what's her name?  Renee was very nice.  Renee was nice.  She blew us off to work for a morning zoo.  That was real nice of her.  Francine.  Francine with the big bubble ass.  You know who my favorite was?  Not a big bubble ass.  A nice bubble ass.  Yes, Dan.  Do you guys remember Ugly Betty?  Oh, shit.  I remember Ugly Betty.  Who lasted for like two days.  Yeah.  Wait, who was Ugly Betty?  She was just some chick.  I don't remember now.  She came in and then I think, oh, you called her Ugly Betty and then she never came in.  She was gone by Friday.  Wait, didn't she have a rock t-shirt on? 
[01:26:30]  Probably.  And K-Rocket hired her and they killed her on us for feedback.  Ugly Betty.  See, my favorite female intern was before Danny.  It was a little girl named Luca.  Luca.  I remember Luca.  We came in all bruised up and we asked her a lot of questions and she didn't want to answer  any of the questions about the bruises on her body.  So we started calling her Luca.  So we started calling her Luca.  And then she disappeared.  And she disappeared, never to be seen again.  She just disappeared, Luca.  Who was she?  I don't remember anymore.  She was just some girl and yeah, she was all bruised up all the time. 
[01:27:00]  She came in all bruised.  We were trying to get the authorities involved, but she didn't want us meddling.  And then gone.  My favorite female intern of all time, though, was the tall brunette, Jimmy.  What was her name?  And then she ended up working at BCN because she moved to Boston.  It wasn't Jennifer.  What the fuck was her name?  Rachel.  Rachel.  Rachel.  Beautiful.  Oh, wow.  I forgot about her. 
[01:27:30]  I was in love with her.  Yeah.  You are, right, Jimmy?  I wanted to take her out for a malted, you know what I mean?  Yeah.  I was hungry.  So Quinnipiac College is warning the interns that Letterman might fondle you.  What a fucking asshole that guy is.  What's his name?  Fondle.  He should be called an asshole.  I don't know.  We should say his name and go, you are an asshole.  Letterman's not going to be doing that.  Silvio, what do you got?  I don't know.  Hey, guys.  What's the benefit of the college saying, getting out there in the news? 
[01:28:00]  Oh, but you said maybe to get some exposure today.  Yeah, everyone is looking for their exposure on TV.  Everyone.  Isn't there a better selling point as a business of a college to be able to boast that they  do have internships at the Letterman show?  Because this would only make, I would think they would just stop accepting those interns.  It's kind of like a, hey, okay, here's what I do now.  Yeah, that's true.  I mean, you know, I mean, I had a lot of us in media, especially, we all had to intern.  And holy shit, if someone said that you could intern for Letterman, my fucking God. 
[01:28:30]  You'd have to do it.  You'd have to.  You'd wear that short skirt and march your fucking little ass in there, right?  That's right.  Shake your round eye.  Shake that.  Shake it.  Grace Levin.  Is it abroad?  Grace Levin, you're an asshole.  Wow.  You're an asshole.  I can't do the voice, though.  Is she a feminist?  She's the Quinnipiac College.  Is she a feminist?  Of course she is.  She must be, right? 
[01:29:00]  I can tell from a picture.  I think she's smart enough to know that Letterman's not going to be, I mean, the visual is what?  Letterman with his pants down around his ankles, chasing young interns?  Yes.  He's busy.  He's trying to put a show together.  You fucking idiot.  Well, he was able to do a little fucking on the side.  Yeah, but it was all consensual.  Yeah.  It wasn't Letterman as a predator like this woman is kind of hinting at.  She's saying that-  It's a big difference.  Girls can't make up their own minds, and they will just become hypnotized by David Letterman, 
[01:29:30]  I guess.  You guys are missing something.  What?  First of all, I always get phlegm when I eat milk.  Second of all, it's self-interest.  They're worried about being sued.  Ooh, is that her?  They're worried about sending interns who are sexually harassed and then sue the college  for putting them in that position.  Is this your red-eye material?  No, I just-  We can't accept your red-eye material.  No, I didn't do anything on the show.  This is-  Oh, God.  That's her?  Let me see.  She just wishes someone would pay attention to her.  That's where that comes from.  She never gets looked at by anybody. 
[01:30:00]  Gollum.  She looks horrendous.  Gollum.  She's fucking-  She does.  She's got flat fucking bangs.  She has hair like an SS field marshal or a fucking Hitler's casual hairdo.  It's just about-  What a casual Hitler do.  It's just about all gray.  It looks like it's cut above her ears unless it's pulled back in some kind of fucking bun  in the back.  No, it's cut real short.  And then the bangs are kind of hanging loosey-goosey.  But the bangs are real long.  She's got a giant forehead. 
[01:30:30]  Oh, she is atrocious.  And look at those ears.  Oh, my God.  She can hear us.  What?  She can hear us.  Oh, this is Randy Spears once in.  No one-  Randy.  Hey, OB, you're homo.  It's Randy Spears.  I remember this guy.  Randy does a morning show on Long Island.  Randy, no one's going to go with this bit.  No one knows what you're doing.  I like it.

This is just general business.  Like, there's other categories.  Yeah, yeah.  There's other categories.  How are they going to even... 
[01:39:00]  We're already up to 35 categories in the one.  Well, this is just the general business category.  Now, if you go back, you can see...  Here, let me go to...  See, that was general business.  That's arts and entertainment, general business, green, sports, health and wellness, family,  not-for-profit, food and restaurants.  No one's going to vote for half this shit.  Maybe FH Riley's is in food and restaurants.  Oh, shit.  Let's go.  Best all-you-can-eat.  Iraq, any suggestions?  Best American continental...  What is FH?  Wait, yeah, American continental is my bro's joint. 
[01:39:30]  FH is not even on the fucking list.  Oh, man.  You're being ripped off.  This fucking best of things sucks a dick.  Best bagels.  Best bakery.  Maybe you have to submit yourself.  Best barbecue.  Best bar.  Best bartenders.  Oh, fuck.  Let's forget.  This is fun.  Let's do the whole list on the air.  Yeah, yeah.  Really?  This is horrible.  What kind of panic?  Best calamari.  Best calamari.  Calamari is the easiest thing to make. 
[01:40:00]  This is stupid.  Have you ever had a calamari where you go, wow, this is the best calamari I've ever had.  It's just acceptable.  Sometimes they get a little rubbery.  And I don't like a lot of the octopus feed in there.  I like the round rings.  Best farm stand.  I like those lightly breaded foreskins.  Best french fries.  Mm-mm.  Oh, my God.  These best of lists suck.  How are they going to print all these?  I don't know.  I guess it'll be all in a special edition of the Long Island Press. 
[01:40:30]  The only people that will give a shit are the people that actually won.  So that they could put it on their storefront.  Yeah, yeah.  As seen in.  It looks impressive or something.  Winner of the 2010 best of.  I should sue them for having my name as part of this.  What was the criteria for being nominated?  I don't know.  Because I'm from Long Island.  I feel left out.  Best Irish bar.  Do you really?  Best Italian restaurant.  All right, enough.  Sam, what do we got for Jacktober?  Jacktober.  Somebody will be playing us fucking reading that list. 
[01:41:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Can you believe they read the...  Oh, who's the best...  Oh.  Mm-hmm.  Now, I've had some good pizza in Huntington.  I love pizza.  Sam, Jacktober time.  Well...  Best place to have a Budweiser.  I swear, that's there.  What?  Best place to have a Budweiser?  Is my house there?  No, it's a fucking photo of your Escalade.  Yes, that's great. 
[01:41:30]  A lot of restaurant categories.  I don't see any fucking F.H. Riley's in there.  Nope.  Oh, boy, did they blow at this dumb newspaper.  I don't acknowledge about them.  Unless you have to submit yourself to be considered...  Who gives a shit if I win Best Long Island Personality?  But to my brother, that would be a cool little thing for his business.  So they could go fuck themselves.  Sam, Jacktober time.  What do you got?  Well, we visited Memphis yesterday.  And since Anthony was sickly, I decided, let's stay in Memphis and visit one of their other primetime morning shows. 
[01:42:00]  There's that much talent in Memphis?  You could do two in a row?  Yes.  If this satellite radio thing doesn't work out, I think you guys should move to Memphis.  Yeah, do you?  Nice.  Maney and Riley.  What do we know about Maney and Riley in the morning?  They do mornings on Q107.5, which plays all the hits.  I love when stations say all the hits.  Thank God they're playing all the hits.  Every hit.  Thank God.  Yes.  Aren't hits just that hits?  They're hits.  Why would you have to say we play all of them? 
[01:42:30]  All the hits.  Not just some of the hits.  That's the reason they're hits.  Not just the top hits, but all the hits.  Because they're playing them.  It's not top hits.  They're all the hits.  But they might leave some out.  Not this station.  They don't, though.  Correct.  This station is not.  Popular songs are hits, and a station plays all of them.  Yes.  Every single time.  This station, Q107.5.  And believe it or not, in between playing all the hits, Maney and Riley give us a little  injection of personality. 
[01:43:00]  Oh, thank God.  Jack Tober starts today with this.  Sam wrote this.  Maney and Riley do 74 seconds of the most boring, unnecessary radio anyone's ever heard.  Yes.  I don't know.  We did some boring radio just now.  We were just talking about a best of list.  I believe.  More boring than that?  I believe that after you hear this clip, you guys will all feel pretty good about your  let's read the list segment.  Really?  Yes.  You're confident in that? 
[01:43:30]  I am.  All right.  Here we go.  Jack Tober for today.  We look at Maney and Riley in the morning on Q107.5 in Memphis.  All the hits.  Thanks so much for tuning in to the Q this morning.  We appreciate you punching us in on your dial.  Because not everybody has a rotary dial, so now you're going to punch us.  Okay.  Gotcha.  In fact, in my car, I got 107.5 three out of my six because I'm always curious to hear  what Drex and Dilo have to say about us. 
[01:44:00]  All right.  Well, Halloween, of course, right around the corner.  And I'm going to ask you guys how much you plan on spending on your Halloween costume  this year.  According to the National Retail Federation, I didn't even know there was a national retail  I don't know if I can sit through the complete 74 seconds, Sam.  Why?  We're only halfway done.  He said that, man.  We're only halfway done.  How much do you plan on spending on your Halloween costume? 
[01:44:30]  Why are people just getting crazy with their...  Well, with the economy and their recession, you might want to ask as much as last year.  I have a pertinent question now.  I spent $1,400 last year.  This year, I'm spending $71.  Halloween is right around the corner, and it's important that since it's about two and  a half weeks away, to have a new Halloween topic every day.  Because if there's one thing that's on the forefront of all of our minds every morning,  it's Halloween is approaching.  We did our Halloween break today, so we understand that. 
[01:45:00]  What did we say?  All haunted house suck a dick.  Suck.  Except the one in Ulster Park.  What are you dressing up as?  Oh.  Oh, I'm not sure yet.  I'm eagerly awaiting the child that hangs himself.  Yeah.  That story.  Yeah, it happens every year.  Some dopey kid thinks it's going to be fun, and he'll scare his friends by hanging himself,  and he hangs himself.  Actually hangs himself by accident, yeah.  You ought to go as a princess.  Oh.  Touching me. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, he is leaning over and just pawing out there.  Uncle Paul likes Sam's multicolored nipples.  He likes to tweak them.  Samuel cries.  What is that?  Enough with the Bacon Brothers.  Are they really making music that anyone gives a shit about?  Are they?  I've never heard their stuff.  They've been fucking trying to do this for years.  Let's hear it.  You a handsome man, Mr. Garrison.  It's horrible.  Is it bad?  Kevin plays the harmonica, and his brother plays the guitar and sings.  Kevin was singing before, though, unless he was just harmonizing. 
[01:46:00]  They've been trying to make it as the Bacon Brothers for years.  No one cares.  Kevin Bacon's kind of made it as an actor.  Kind of.  He's huge.  That's what I mean.  And now he's trying to make his brother.  It's like a little sarcasm in there.  Like, why is he doing this?  He, you know, kind of has a name for himself in Hollywood.  Maybe he kind of needs some money after Bernie done took it all.  Oh, was he on the list?  I heard he took a beating.  Yeah.  I heard that they lost everything.  And that could be false.  That might be why he's fucking blowing a harmonica. 
[01:46:30]  I hope it's not true.  He's been doing this for at least 10 years.  I want to hear some of their stuff, and then I'll shit on it if it's bad.  At the only award show that we ever went to, they were the entertainment.  And that was probably 10 years ago.  What else was the Namble Awards going to do?  And why the spa music with this show there?  Yeah.  Mania Riley.  It's a new age garbage.  I don't know.  Some morning shows, Scorch, for instance, take great pride in finding techno beds that 
[01:47:00]  they could talk over.  You got to talk over a techno bed.  He always played techno beds on the rock station that he worked for.  I want to hear his TV show again.  Obsessed with it.  I wish that he'd.  We're not allowed.  Because copyright infringement, all the clips are still online, but it's like no audio.  The YouTube clips had the audio cut out.  Because, oh, because he used music that.  That's not why.  It was somebody with ears decided to.  Yes.  Enjoy the silent film. 
[01:47:30]  Legs Zeppelin.  He's bringing it back.  Legs Zeppelin is copyrighted, of course.  Let's get back to Mania and Riley in the morning.  No retail federation.  I didn't even know there was a national retail federation.  Of course there is.  Yeah.  How much do you think people plan on spending on their Halloween costume on an average?  What would you say, Riley?  A hundred bucks.  A hundred bucks?  Yeah.  Is that what you usually spend a year?  About a hundred bucks?  I mean, it just depends.  Like last year I spent like 30 because I kind of just put it together.  And then the year before that it was like 70 because it was a really cool costume. 
[01:48:00]  That's what's averaging to be.  Well, according to the National Retail Federation, Riley, you are spending almost five times more than everybody else.  Wow, really?  Yeah, the average is about 21 bucks.  Really?  That's how much the average person is going to spend on a Halloween costume this year.  And I thought that was a little low.  Not only was that really boring, it was completely inaccurate.  Didn't she say she spent $20 and then another year she spent what?  She said, I usually spend $100. 
[01:48:30]  Last year I spent $30 and the year before I spent $70.  And then he said that the average is $21, which is five times more than she's spending, which is just not true.  But no, because if you average hers out, it will average somewhere what?  Like $50 something.  Yeah, maybe.  So maybe twice as much.  Twice would be the answer, yes.  Not five times.  And that's if you were listening.  Right.  But I was nodding off during that.  It was only 74 seconds. 
[01:49:00]  And we broke it up.  If I was going to do a Halloween costume break, I would do the one that was on the news the other day about tweens wearing provocative.  They're calling them slutty.  Provocative.  Slutty costumes.  Costumes.  How much do they cost?  Who gives a shit, Sam?  About $100.  Yeah, I figured.  But they're strutting around dressed like little French maids in little short little cat suits and things like that, just looking completely inappropriately dressed. 
[01:49:30]  And they went to the man on the street interviews and people outraged.  There's some outrage.  Yeah, my favorite is when someone thinks they have an original idea and they show up at the party and there's 10 others dressed exactly like them.  What happened?  Like if you're trying to do the Lady Gaga thing this year, don't.  Save yourself.  A lot of people are going to be a Lady Gaga.  You know, the red thing in front of her face, that's going to be a big one this year.  I hate when people know who I am by my Halloween costume, Gregory.  Ted.  Hi, Ted.  I put on a plastic Darth Vader mask last year. 
[01:50:00]  Everybody says, Theodore, how are you?  How did they know it was you?  I don't know.  I said, Luke, I'm your father.  Somebody punched me through my mask.  Whack in my eye.  And I stole my candy.  You didn't like that?  No, I was just intrixing and treatsing.  Darth Vader mask.  Yeah, slutty costume.  I hate when Uncle Paul takes me tricksin' and treatsin'. 
[01:50:30]  Tricksin' and treatsin'?  Never heard it put that way.  Let's get back to Jacktober.  Maney and Riley continue to try to make something interesting out of Halloween and they fail miserably.  Because I don't know what I want to be yet, so I got to be something.  Yeah, you do.  You know, and I don't know.  I'm not a huge fan of Halloween anyway.  I never used to be before, but now it's like the one chance that you can dress up and look stupid or slutty if you even want to. 
[01:51:00]  A naughty blank.  Yeah.  Yeah, everybody's a naughty blank.  I don't know, man.  Oh.  I don't know, because it's such a huge thing.  It's like a lot of pressure, gotta dress up, you know, gotta go buy something.  Then you don't want to be a double.  Have these two ever met?  This guy doesn't have a thought in his head.  I like that they almost went to that interesting place that Ant was talking about with the slutty costumes.  And what's a slutty blank? 
[01:51:30]  Bitch, whore, what?  Probably whore.  Whore or hoe.  Well, no, I think blank is, insert the blank here.  It could be any costume, whether it be costume.  The way you say costume is enraging.  Isn't it just you want to punch him square in his face?  And the T and the U together, that's the same.  Costume.  Costume.  It's costume.  Costume.  Say customer.  Customer.  Right.  There's a crisp snapping in ustomer.  Yes.  Why is costume not having a crisp snapping? 
[01:52:00]  Because of the um.  Because it ends in a vowel.  So what?  It's the rule.  You're like the Jimmy Dean.  It's not the rule.  You're like the Jimmy Dean guy.  Sush.  Say costume.  Costume.  Say cos.  Cos.  Toom.  Toom.  No, say it then.  Costume.  No, that's not.  How do you say it?  How do you say it?  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  You want to see his lips when he says it.  His teeth stay apart.  I think that's what makes it.  It's the most fucking punchable thing I've ever seen.  I think that's what makes it great. 
[01:52:30]  They can't see that out there.  I want to.  I love you.  Yeah, you do.  Costume.  You stick your lips out.  Costume.  Dress up like an angel.  Uncle Paul is touching you.  This kid's beautiful.  He won't tell either, Uncle Paul.  Oh, good.  I hate it.  He's a good boy.  Yeah, Danny would always tattle on me.  He didn't mean to, but he'd drink some of that stuff and start talking a lot.  Uncle Paul, you like how he says costume.  I do.  It's adorable. 
[01:53:00]  Sometimes I'll have him say it into my underpants.  Costume.  Get a lot of warm air that way, right?  Yeah, he knows what I like.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  Costume.  All right.  Manny and Riley continue to try to make something interesting.  Okay, we continue with this clip.  A lot of pressure.  Got to dress up.  You know, got to go buy something.  Then you don't want to be a double.  When you go out, you don't want somebody wearing the same thing you do.  Yeah, that's my only issue.  I refuse to buy my costume at one of the Halloween places around because then 60 other people are going to have it. 
[01:53:30]  Yeah, I know.  Wow.  Wow, that is incredibly boring.  They should go as a fired radio show.  How do you guys deal with the pressure of picking out a Halloween outfit?  Oh, my goodness.  It is such pressure, you know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I make my own at home.  Oh.  I, um, yeah.  Okay.  I taped a piece of toilet paper around my head and face, and I went as a boy with the mumps.  This guy's not even going to go dressed up as anything. 
[01:54:00]  No, neither is she.  She's sitting at home.  Right.  Can I see them, Dan?  Do we have photos or no?  Me.  I'll be 107.5.  Maney and Riley.  All right.  Let's do the next clip as Danny finds their pictures.  Maney and Riley cover the Michael Jackson story.  We covered the Michael Jackson story.  Exactly.  All right.  This ought to be interesting.  Riley has no clue who Paul Anka is.  Yes.  Maney tries to save her and laughs at her at the end.  True that.  This should be good. 
[01:54:30]  I think so.  Sticking you in the middle of hit music and Hollywood sleaze.  It's E on the Q with Riley.  So, Michael Jackson, his music goes on, but the drama goes on right along with it.  This new single that's just.  When you say but, there's supposed to be a contradiction.  Yeah.  His music goes on, but the drama goes on.  Dope.  But.  It should have been.  And so does.  Yes.  Or the music goes on, but the drama doesn't.  Or whatever.  Yeah.  That's the way you use the word but. 
[01:55:00]  You don't say but and then have a continuance.  Wow.  Jackson, his music goes on, but the drama goes on right along with it.  This new single that's just come out.  This is it.  This is it.  This is the one that was released yesterday.  Right.  We played it.  We like it, right?  Yeah.  We debuted it.  Apparently, this one was not his.  It's going to be added.  I thought we debuted it.  That's why they liked it.  Yeah, we debuted it.  No, they debuted it.  They just said.  No, we fucking had the world premiere yesterday, Sam.  No, Manny and Riley just said they debuted it.  That's cute, but everyone knows we had the world premiere of the Michael Jackson song. 
[01:55:30]  They're probably going to be spinning that a lot, I think, and that's why they like it.  Hey, we like it.  We like it.  The PD told them, you know, we're going to be playing this, so say you like it.  Right.  We played it.  We like it, right?  Yeah, we debuted it.  Apparently, this one was not his song.  There's this dude named Paul Anka that came out and said.  Paul Anka?  The dude.  What a cant.  Look, I understand she's probably very young, but if you're working in music radio, you 
[01:56:00]  got to kind of know some random dude.  Some of the pioneers.  Paul Anka.  She's an Anka around this guy's neck.  I know.  I wonder if she drinks Sunker in the morning so she doesn't get all caffeinated.  You think she has an uncle bracelet?  An uncle bracelet.  You think she's a cunt?  That was released yesterday.  Right.  We played it. 
[01:56:30]  We like it, right?  Right.  We debuted it.  Apparently, this one was not his song.  There's this dude named Paul Anka that came out and said he and Michael were supposed to  get together and do this track together as a duet.  Then, deal went sour.  Michael went back, took the tapes.  And then, there was going to be a whole suit.  He was going to sue Michael.  Right.  Return the tapes.  But then, Michael had recorded this himself.  So, then, Anka later gave it to this person, Sapphire, who recorded it in 1990.  Oh, Anka. 
[01:57:00]  I think my dad had a Paul Anka CD or a tape around somewhere.  Well, here's a...  Why the fuck isn't this guy laughing at her for saying Paul Anka when he knows that his  name's Paul Anka?  He should make her say it over who?  That's what I would do.  Instead, God forbid you do some good radio.  Paul Anka.  Instead, he's coming in...  Staring at you, you idiot.  He's coming in with an anecdote about Paul Anka.  That way she doesn't have to be embarrassed.  Yeah.  Oh, God forbid you embarrass someone on the radio.  Why is that bad?  Well, because, you know...  You do that in real life. 
[01:57:30]  If your fucking friend is walking around saying Paul Anka, he's going to get a beating.  That doesn't sound like friends to me.  No.  That's hurt feelings.  Michael had recorded this himself.  So then, Anka later gave it to this person, Sapphire, who recorded it in 1990.  I think my dad had a Paul Anka CD or a tape around somewhere.  Well, here's a Sapphire's version of it.  That's the best thing you can do is kind of laugh very lightly.  Just get on under his breath.  Just get on under his breath.  Anka, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[01:58:00]  Wow.  Is that her right there?  She's kind of cute.  Wow, this is pretty hot.  I can't tell when she's sucking on a dunking donut thing.  Yeah, she's retarded, but she's fucking hot.  She better not brush that hair back.  There's a lot of skull showing.  Yeah, there's something going on there.  It's the bane of her existence.  She probably spends an hour bobby pinning that shit so the wind doesn't blow back.  Bobby pinning.  She looks like a fucking baby with a bonnet with that hairdo.  There's nothing worse than a fucking chick with a bunch of wispy hairs up front and a whole bunch of skull. 
[01:58:30]  Yeah, very flat.  Not much body to that hair.  No, has the luster of a tire iron.  Let's see her not sipping on something.  Why?  Well, I want to see what she likes.  Because she makes her face kind of weird.  What about one of those other pictures?  Like there, yeah.  She's got youth on her side.  She's all right.  Jesus, look at all that fucking...  Thank God that hair is there.  Picture that hair.  Wow, yeah. 
[01:59:00]  Oh, my God.  Let's go to...  Fucking forehead like a Klingon.  Exactly.  Excuse me, you with the chemo wig.  Look, it's Rocky Dennis drinking fucking Dunkin' Donuts.  Why are we saying this stuff?  She's cute.  She is.  Let's go to Dan in New York.  Yeah, she's cute, actually.  Dan.  Hey, boys.  How you doing today?  Hi, Dan.  Good.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you, Dan.  You're quite welcome.  Listen, Paul Unca, more like Unca Paul.  I think I said that. 
[01:59:30]  You did.  All right.  Let's go to Dr. X.  Dr. X.  The boys get recognized.  Don't make a fucking monkey out of me.  I didn't say monkey, did I?  Yep.  You asshole.  Joe in North Carolina.  Joe.  Hey, what's up, man?  Please point out that she said Michael Jackson-en.  She said Michael Jackson-en.  Did she really?  Michael Jackson-en.  Oh, we got to play the clip again.  What the fuck is Michael Jackson-en?  Oh, she's perfect. 
[02:00:00]  She's a dummy.  She is a dope.  Sticking you in the middle of your music and Hollywood sleaze.  It's E on the Q with Riley.  So, Michael Jackson, his music goes on, the drama goes on, right?  Yeah, she was chuckling a little.  She was just chuckling.  Manny wants to know why you're freaking out.  That's the thing.  That's their bit?  You get people to call, hey, why are you freaking out this morning?  Do they smile after they're done freaking out? 
[02:00:30]  Well, I mean, it's not the rule, but they don't want to get carried away.  Like, they're not calling to say super negative stuff.  Just kind of keep it fun.  All right, let's listen to this.  If you are freaking out right now about something, tell us why.  Hi, Michelle.  Hi.  What is it that you are freaking out about?  I am three weeks late.  Oh, no.  Well, wait, wait.  Before we start saying bad things, like, would it be a good thing if you...  Where do you get that sound effect from?  I mean, it would be a blessing, of course, but we're not engaged yet, and I am in the 
[02:01:00]  master's program, and I don't graduate until, like, I'm in my first year of my master's  program, so...  Have you told him?  He has an idea, because he kind of was asking me, so have you started yet?  And he's like, no, no, but don't worry.  I'm just stressed.  Well, he's going to know now, isn't he?  Yeah.  Michelle, he has an idea, because you've been freaking out! 
[02:01:30]  See, because this segment is about freaking out.  Yeah, yeah.  So he got a freak...  He freaked out.  Because Michelle was kind of downplaying and monotone, so luckily...  He brought some energy to it.  And then he was there...  Shit.  ...to remind everybody that we're freaking out today.  The lack of chemistry in that room is stunning.  It made me think maybe these two aren't married after all.  No. 
[02:02:00]  I don't think so.  No, they're...  No.  Michelle, the maybe pregnant woman you just heard?  Yes.  Calls back.  Manny gets a little carried away.  Yeah, he gets a little like, come on, just cool your jets a little.  Oh.  We just spoke with Michelle a little while ago.  Uh-huh.  Michelle was three weeks late.  Right.  And we're asking people, why are they freaking out?  Well, that's a good enough reason to freak out, right, Michelle?  Yeah, it is.  Now, what happened?  My neighbor was just listening to the radio, apparently, and she knocked on my door and  said, are you serious? 
[02:02:30]  I'm like, yeah.  She's like, well, I've got a pregnancy test if you want it.  I was like, yeah.  That's a nice neighbor.  Mm-hmm.  And so she brought it over.  I took it, and we waited about five minutes.  Right.  And it was negative.  So thank God it is just...  Manny.  Did you just...  Don't pay attention to Manny.  So are you happy, or...  Yeah, are you happy, or are you kind of sad?  I can't believe.  Good.  Oh.  Because that hallelujah, it's like, is that really necessary?  Yeah.  You're that happy, you're not going to have a little one. 
[02:03:00]  Well, no, that's the guy's point of view.  Yeah.  He's playing the guy's point of view.  He's just being a hallelujah.  He's being a guy.  Actually, I thought I was taking a dump, and when I wiped, a maraschino cherry was on  the tissue.  So all's well that ends well.  That's right.  I grabbed my stomach like Adrian and Rocky II, and I fucking chipped my teeth in the toilet.  So, say bye-bye to little Fletchy. 
[02:03:30]  Oh, your newborn looks a little flushed.  Is he okay?  Hey.  Hey, shit.  It's so stupid.  It is.  He looks flushed. 
[02:04:00]  What an asshole.  Hey.  Oh, boy.  Well, they seem to be having a great time with this woman.  And, boy, they had that hallelujah thing, Klippa, queued up pretty quickly.  That's manny for you.  Yeah.  Jesus Christ.  It certainly is.  Why is Duke calling us with a cancus sore?  Duke.  I am developing a conker sore.  Oh, he's got a conker sore.  I got you. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  You got a conker sore.  I thought we were playing I'm freaking out.  Should we play a round of freaking out?  Who's freaking out this morning?  Are we getting the pilot Chesley Sullenberger in for his new book called One Decision, Three  Pages?  I hit merge.  I landed.  Epilogue.  Yeah, really?  Yeah, I knew it was going to be a special day.  I had my coffee.  All right.  You've got a book out?  Yes.  Yes, this is why I hate saying yes to all these guest pitches.  He'll be fun, though. 
[02:05:00]  He'll be fun.  We'll get him.  We're obviously not getting him.  This is the days in town.  What is the thing called?  The book?  I don't know.  It's called Fuck Geese.  No, it's actually called Geese or Cunts.  Captain Chesley Sully Sullenberger with his new book, Geese or Cunts.  Thank you for joining us, Captain.  Thank you, miss.  In the middle of his pictures, you can just look at him hitting geese with golf clubs and 
[02:05:30]  fucking kicking them in their little geese asses.  You see a little sad goose with a boot in the middle of its body?  Old Chesley taking care of goose business.  Chesley hates the geese.  Despises them.  Half the book is goose recipes.  Things you can make like dog food and cat food out of geese carcasses.  He despises geese.  Chesley.  Chesley.  Yes.  So I guess we're not getting him on the show? 
[02:06:00]  Oh, no.  He would not come on this program.  What's the name of the book?  Highest Duty.  Highest Duty.  It's about someone who left an upper decker in his toilet.  He had a friend come over and shit in his septic tank.  They buy the book.  It has nothing to do with that fateful day.  I'll tell you.  Highest Duty.  It's what was in the pilot and co-pilot seat after they hit that water.  Well, Highest Duty is whichever copy of that book is on the top of the pile.  Shit.  That book is going to fucking stink. 
[02:06:30]  Highest Duty.  He just made it a bore fest.  A willful boy saying it should be more than just the crash.  We were joking about fucking that guy today.  He'll start off with the fuck.  He'll start off talking about the crash.  And then he'll go into his fucking awful, boring life.  You know, me and my wife met back in.  Oh, who cares?  Exactly.  Forward.  And then you just keep flipping through the pages until you see plane crash.  You look for a picture of a goose with a startle look on his face. 
[02:07:00]  Hopefully the passenger got a picture of it.  Well, the geese went through the engines and, uh...  You think the goose would look startle?  Yes, it would.  And how does the goose look startle?  I don't know.  His eyes bug out.  And he goes, actually, you don't know that, but goose have hands and they do this.  Nah.  Oh, his book is going to be...  I wish we had a copy of it.  It's going to be fucking terrible.  Yeah, got to see that.  You're right, though.  It'll start out.  You know, I was on the runway. 
[02:07:30]  It'll start all that.  And then it'll kind of do a flashback.  For 200 pages and finally tell us what happened.  Well, he'll say, like, yeah, we're on the runway.  All was ready to go.  We're taking off.  We fly.  It's a lovely day after.  And then a thud.  Chapter two.  My mom and daddy bitch.  On a clan rally.  No one cares.  200 pages of horse shit.  That gives a shit.  Hey, my co-pilot back was in prison for trading inappropriate photo.  All right.  Could someone go...  It's highest duty. 
[02:08:00]  What...  My search for what really matters.  The fucking...  The landing flaps, asshole.  A runway.  Exactly.  There was Teterboro in Newark and you hit the fucking river, you cunt.  Thanks for nothing, shit dick.  My shoes got wet.  Thanks a lot.  My search for what really matters.  Hats and shitty mustaches.  Apparently made your list.  Fucking mustaches and raging.  It really is.  Who is it with, Danny?  I love this stupid mustache. 
[02:08:30]  It's with...  Oh, we got to...  Oh, all right.  Oh, it's some excerpts.  We got to see...  Let's see the excerpts.  Jeffrey Zaslow.  Zaslow?  Yes, it should say written completely by Jeffrey Zaslow.  That's usually the case.  Yep.  Photo of this guy.  Sullenberg did not write his own fucking book.  In case there's captain's hat in his right hand, man, reporting for duty.  I love Zaslow.  What are some of the...  He used to do the technical fun.  I knew where you were going with that.  Oh, boy.  It stinks.  That joke should be chapter nine of this book.  Is this the beginning? 
[02:09:00]  Okay.  The flight lasted just a few minutes, but so many of the details are rich and vivid to me.  I would hope...  Which ones aren't?  Yeah, no kidding.  Like when you saw the geese and didn't get out of the way?  You are totally right.  It says the wind was coming from the north, not the south, which was unusual for that  time of year.  And my wheels made a distinct rumbling sound as they rolled across the rural Texas airstrip.  What?  He's starting in Texas?  Oh, yeah.  He's got to get us to LaGuardia.  And I didn't know what was in store for me on that fateful day. 
[02:09:30]  Chapter two.  Let's see.  Well, he starts in Texas.  Yeah.  I had a cup of coffee.  Um, yes.  And I, I remember that because it was a very strong cup of coffee and I had a log the  size of a forearm, uh, ready to fall out of my hiney.  Oof.  I wanted to bail out of that one before I did.  Oh, no.  He's back in 1967.  Oh, my God.  What was it?  Like his first flight?  Within two paragraphs, he goes back to 1967.  It was June 3rd, 67. 
[02:10:00]  I was 16 years old.  Oh, shit.  This book is over by page four.  It was his first solo flight.  I drew on, oh.  He landed that one in a lake.  Yeah, exactly.  He loves the water.  He sure does.  He used to have a kite.  He'd always land it in a puddle.  What are some of the chapter titles, Danny?  Because they'll give away where the book is going.  Yeah, yeah.  Chapter one.  First 30 seconds.  Chapter two.  Here we go.  Chapter one is a flight you'd never forget.  Oh, boy. 
[02:10:30]  A pilot's life.  Chapter two is a pilot's life.  Those who came before me.  All right.  Oh, no.  All the older Sullenbergs who are fucking.  Measure twice, cut once.  Measure twice, cut once.  All right.  A chapter about his circumcision.  The gift of girls.  Oh, good.  That's what I want to hear about.  How the guy who landed in the river got his first piece of ass while fucking some girl ate marmalade in the backseat of his fucking Edsel.  It's not even that good.  It's probably the birth of his daughters or something. 
[02:11:00]  Showing up for life.  Anything is possible.  The next one is a fast, neat, average.  He, I guess, analyzes the way he fucks on any different.  Seven is long-term optimist, short-term realist.  Wow.  Hopefully one-time author.  Number eight.  This is the captain speaking.  Chapter nine, showing up for life.  Chapter 10, anything is possible. 
[02:11:30]  Apparently, except hitting a runway when you take off from LaGuardia.  Number 11, managing the situation.  This is what we're going to learn about how he got his managerial skills to be cool as a cucumber under pressure.  You know, managing the situation.  It's when Grady came and talked to him about his son.  Exactly.  Well, I was about to take off and I decided to murder my co-pilot and a family with an axe.  Yeah, he was flying the Continental flight that fucking Scatbag Brothers was on.  That's his big black toes in the screenshot. 
[02:12:00]  Those giant fucking macadamia in that toes.  The view from above.  Yeah.  The 13, sudden, complete, symmetrical.  What the fucking title is that?  14 is a great chapter.  Gravity.  Gravity.  Let me explain gravity to you.  Yes.  Chapter 15.  155.  Stories heard.  Lives touched.  I guess 16 is when he interviews. 
[02:12:30]  I bet you there's some testimony from the grateful passengers.  Yes.  And they're going to discuss what they were thinking.  Yeah.  A wild ride.  It's a wild ride.  Yes.  18 is just called home.  Home.  That was probably after.  And then 19, the question.  Ah.  Okay.  Are you gay?  Yes.  Why did you write this book?  Why isn't this a leaflet?  Why isn't this a fucking three-paragraph blog? 
[02:13:00]  Like, there's nothing about...  That situation that we haven't heard already.  We know it all.  It should have been an article in Time Magazine.  Exactly.  Not a book.  I want to hear about your fucking...  I want to hear about when the flare got shot in your helicopter.  Right?  Well, Lance had a surfboard.  We took off from LaGuardia.  You shut up.  He's doing a book signing in the Long Island Sound.  He's just going to sit there in the water.  It'll probably be a bestseller.  I would just be great.  And I'm sure he'll talk about the keys to the city and meeting the president. 
[02:13:30]  Ah, yeah.  Fucking gives a turkey.  Right.  Hey, we got to go back to Mania and Riley because I'm getting some intel here.  Oh, good.  A bunch of people, especially Dave S. in Philly.  Have you read this hole's bio on her website?  And this is the quote.  She got butt by the radio bug and did a stink in Michigan.  She got butt by the radio bug and did a stink in Michigan.  Either they're trying to be wacky or they're legitimate typos. 
[02:14:00]  Yeah.  She ain't bad, you know?  Webmaster Bobo.  She don't look too bad.  There's a lot of fucking Facebook fucking voodoo going on with those shots.  Facebook magic?  She purses her lips a lot.  Yeah.  She knows how to look sexy.  She's got one look.  All right, last clip here.  Mania and Riley talk about year read.  What?  Mania gets a bit too mean.  Aw. 
[02:14:30]  So guess who's next up for Playboy Mania?  Marge Simpson.  She'll be on the cover of Playboy.  You said it on Friday.  That's already on the E and the Q blog if you want to check out the picture.  It's actually kind of cute, but no.  Now, Tara Reid is going to be the one that wants to do it now.  Where has she been?  I don't know.  You know, she went down the tube ever since American Pie.  I'm just joking.  Yeah.  She said of the magazine Possibility, she said, I know there's problems with my stomach.  There's bumps on it.  It's uneven.  But she's recently gotten over these issues and wants to show herself off.  She came to push on Friday night.  We wouldn't even let her in.  Oh, stop it.  Oh, that's mean.  She wasn't popular enough. 
[02:15:00]  That's mean.  That's mean.  That's mean.  At least she told him.  Boy, is that the joke.  Did you hear the jokes we just had on Sullenberger?  The duty of the hole is just to be.  Right.  That's mean.  You regret some of those jokes now?  We're a little mean.  Could you imagine that whole segment with a hole in here?  It would have sounded a little different.  He saved so many people.  I'm not going to be part of this.  No, that's mean.  You guys should stop.  That's mean.  You guys should stop.  Sully was very, he was a hero, an American hero.  That's mean. 
[02:15:30]  He's a goose killer.  I hate him.  It's a murder, massacre of geese.  And the goose's family wrote a book called That Fateful Day.  It's about how the goose was pinching off a nice shit in the yard.  Starts off, yeah.  It's an ordinary day.  It was pinching off all the fuck.  Shit ran through it like a, well, you know.  People are coming up with their own titles for the book.  Like what?  Let's say hi to Tyler in Indianapolis. 
[02:16:00]  Tyler.  Pedo stash.  Good morning, boys.  What's up, Tyler?  Hey, I, no, I think Tyler and myself does the same thing Tully does.  His total title should just be I Got Lucky.  There's no way you can train for that or how good you are you can pull that off.  There's no way.  Yeah, he had a lot in his favor that day.  Yeah, the wind's going right.  The thing, it was like glass, the river that day.  And the thing, when he hit the thing.  But, you know, hey.  It gave him enough time in the air to make some decisions. 
[02:16:30]  Come on.  Guy, he did it.  So, you know, you've got to give him some credit.  Don't be mean.  That's right, Andy.  Oh, yeah, exactly.  Don't be mean, boys.  Don't be mean to Sully.  All right.  Thank you, Tyler.  That book is going to be uninspirational, dreck.  I'm obsessed with reading it now.  I ordered a Kindle.  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  What's wrong with that?  No, so you're going to get that book for the Kindle?  The first thing I'm going to get is read it on a plane.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait until my Kindle comes.  Please give us a report. 
[02:17:00]  It won't be there until next week.  God damn me.  What?  The Kindle.  I could have just bought one, but I bought the one that's got the international Wi-Fi.  What do you mean international?  You don't fly internationally.  Because I'm an asshole, Hope.  Where are you going?  I don't think you've ever been out of the country.  You want to read in Japan?  But if I do, even if I do fly out of the country, I think I'm going to have to download a book immediately.  Yeah.  You would just download it ahead of time.  Why did you need international Wi-Fi?  I don't know.  I want to eat Sully's mustache.  I want him to shave it, and I want to have it.  I want to mix it in with jam. 
[02:17:30]  I want to fucking eat it off a dog's dick.  Put it on top of a piece of sushi.  No, I want to suck it off a dog's dick.  I know.  I hear you.  What the fuck is wrong?  I love how he corrects me.  No, I really want to suck it off.  You imagine if you shave his mustache, and then you mix it up in some jam, and the poor dog came over. 
[02:18:00]  He just grabbed him.  He just smear it on there, and then just lick off the deliciousness.  Yeah, and you watch his legs stop kicking when he realizes everything's going to be okay.  He's getting blown.  Oh, my God.  Maybe that's why they don't push the show publicly and make proud announcements about it.  I don't think Bob Edwards is talking about Sully's mustache being cut off. 
[02:18:30]  Mixed with jam, smeared on a dog dick so he can lick it off.  No, of course not.  Now, guys, let's not make fun of people.  Oh, okay.  Sorry.  Kindle.  Why is it called a Kindle?  Actually, because you're, I don't know, because maybe it's shit, and you throw it in and burn it like firewood.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  No, come on.  Or maybe because you buy it with a Barbie?  No, no.  It's not funny.  Oh, God, no. 
[02:19:00]  That was horrible.  It's awful.  But no, I really want one.  It's like small, and I have a Stephen King book.  I'm reading Bag of Bones, and it's like a thick paperback.  I'm like, what am I doing?  Just throw it in the Kindle.  Heron Carpenter story.  Bag of Bones.  Where's the Steve Carlisi story?  Bag of shit. 
[02:19:30]  Or no, where's the bones?  We got a guy that actually went to a Sullenberger book signing.  Really?  Brian, what do you got?  Opie, how are you doing this morning, man?  Hey, Brian, what do you got?  I walked into Walmart at 1055 last Saturday, and there was a signing at 11, so I thought, hell, I'll go back and watch.  There was about 30 people standing around. 
[02:20:00]  He walked in.  They all applauded.  He signed their books.  He was out of there.  It was the biggest non-event I've ever seen.  I actually feel bad.  I don't want to see the guy embarrassed like that.  No, then that could be a line around the block for Sully.  I'm surprised, though, man.  With all the attention he got, he should have got a lot more fucking people showing up to his book signing.  They brought him out during the Super Bowl.  Guys should have people at his book signing.  And him and the crew waved uncomfortably long until the middle of the third quarter.  Get off the field, you fucking goose-murdering asshole. 
[02:20:30]  We have fucking wagers to cover.  Hey, Goose Hitler, get off the fucking genocide against geese.  He's a criminal.  He should be arrested.  TJ in New York, what do you got?  I want Sully to die in prison alone.  Jesus, TJ.  Yeah, Sully's real name for his book is My Failed Suicide Assent.  God damn it.  No, Carrie.  He was actually gunning for that one goose who owed him money. 
[02:21:00]  Something about a golden egg.  He wouldn't be specific.  Carrie, what do you got?  Good evening.  Hi, Carrie.  Question for you guys.  You're begging the shit out of him, which was not what you did the day after this shit happened.  Right.  You guys get on the plane.  You, Jimmy.  Who do you want flying the fucking thing?  The goose killer?  Muhammad Atta.  Fucking asshole.  Shut up.  We're just having fun?  Really?  Jesus, dude.  Yeah.  Just go with the jokes. 
[02:21:30]  Let's say hi to Joe in Manhattan.  Joe.  The name of the book is I Was Saved Myself.  You Were All Alone for the Ride.  That would be a better title.  Oh, this guy wants to call you an asshole, Jimmy.  Jan.  Jan, go ahead.  Hey, Jimmy.  Fuck you, man.  I'm driving down the road, and you're talking to that fucking dog dick.  I spit coffee all over my glasses.  All over my sunglasses. 
[02:22:00]  All over my windshield.  You guys spitting up coffee because you, Jimmy.  It's too hot as hell.  Oh, God.  Oh, that book is going to be brutal.  Oh, my God.  I want to buy a whole box of it and see if I can skip them across the river. 
[02:22:30]  Oh, I'd rather read my fortune in a magic eight ball than a fucking terrible read.  Devoid of anything.  Stop trying to make me feel inspired.  Someone quickly go through the book and see how many pages he spends on the actual incident  and how much other horseshit's in there.  It's fun, too.  I actually feel bad if he didn't have that money at his book signings, though.  Is he doing any around here?  Let's plug it.  He's a pilot.  No, but still.  Fuck him and his book.  I don't want to see him embarrassed.  We said we would talk to him when the guy blew us off, so fuck him. 
[02:23:00]  All right.  He deserves everything he gets.  How about you just go...  I want everybody to go to his book signing with fucking, like, little geese masks on it  and boo him.  Murderer!  Boo!  Zell!  I know you, you better!  Device pilot! 
[02:23:30]  And he can only sell as many books as he can swallow.  He just sits there with a bunch of geese behind him, and when people come up to get at their  book sign, he snaps the neck and signs it in goose blood.  And then he closes the book on the goose as, like, a bookmarker.  Oh, he hates geese.  Oh, he really does.  He caught some goose fucking a chick he was dating at one point. 
[02:24:00]  The goose had a cigarette, was holding her down and fucking her face.  And he's like, what's going on here?  God, I want to see more of that book.  It's available, uh...  Well, Tuesday's book's come out, so it's probably about...  Maybe he is coming on.  Maybe he's coming in tomorrow.  Who knows?  Yeah.  That'd be nice.  Oh, yeah, now?  Oh, and of course, we'd just be nothing but nice.  Of course we would.  What's that about, uh...  A lot of comments on those chapters. 
[02:24:30]  Hearing he passed on the radio.  Really?  Why?  What does he think he talked on when he saved his own life?  That fucking pregnant...  Really?  Do a TV interview?  Talked on the radio?  Yeah.  Fucking asshole.  Sick of radio not getting respect.  No kidding.  Even though we spent 40 minutes destroying that hunk of shit with a cover.  But he did talk his way out of it through a radio.  Of course he did.  Motherfucker.  How about some respect?  How do you think they knew where you were landing, you dummy?  I know.  They don't mention the other time when he was flying and he hit a water buffalo. 
[02:25:00]  He's lousy.  He hit a unicorn once.  Fucking...  Clip Superman.  The balloon and up.  Oh, shit.  Oh, fuck.  That makes me laugh a lot.  Sully's book.  Oh.  I can't wait to...  I might have to read...  Chapter two.  Wake up, reader. 
[02:25:30]  There's nothing worse than a book about one small event.  I know.  What?  The catch was good.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  More than a catch or whatever.  More than a catch.  Yeah, that was a good book.  No, it wasn't.  No, it wasn't.  It was just the catch.  Yeah, the Giants didn't even think so.  They released your ass.  You would think they would keep him around because it was more than a catch.  And, Sully, you think any pilot could write a book and put shit in it except for landing in the Hudson River? 
[02:26:00]  That's like the only part you'd want to read.  Of course.  Yeah.  I don't care about the good flights.  Yeah.  Every pilot could write that book.  Yeah.  I could write a book about sitting in the fucking seat, reading a magazine, watching a movie, and then, you know, getting out.  Chapter eight.  Turbulence from 250 to 254.  Coffee spillage.  Chapter one through 20.  I'll have another Bloody Mary.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Yeah.  Good old Sully.  Well, who are we to make fun?  Godspeed, Sully.  Godspeed.  Like a hero.  Godspeed.  Did stuff we could never do.  Yeah.  Actually save people's lives.  Could never crash a plane.  He did exactly what I could do.  What I couldn't do was avoid the geese.  And neither could he.  He did exactly what I could do.  Fly for three minutes and then crash in the water. 
[02:27:00]  With no engines.  I could do that now.  Yeah.  Why is he special?  Fucking.  Oh, shit.  Let's go to Ken in Cleveland.  Ken, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just saw you.  You said Sully turned down radio, but he was on local Cleveland stations this morning.  Oh, was he?  Great.  He turns out Opie and Anthony to do local fucking radio in Cleveland.  Cleveland.  Great.  A place where no one has money to buy his book. 
[02:27:30]  Of course not.  That makes sense, Sully.  When you see the Cleveland demo, they don't want his book.  Right.  Phil, Minnesota.  They think Sullenberger is a new thing at McDonald's.  Fucking idiots.  I want a Sullenberger.  They think that's a cranky hamburger.  He could crash into Cleveland and kill no one on the ground.  Empty shit city.  And now that I had to add that part in.  Jesus. 
[02:28:00]  Oh, fuck him.  Phil.  He was fucking aiming for the towers and he missed.  He's a prick.  Phil, what do you got?  Terrorist.  Over there?  Yeah, go ahead.  There you go.  Do you think Sully has Aflac insurance?  That's pretty funny.  I don't know why that didn't get a laugh.  Yeah, it should have gotten a laugh.  I do.  I respect that one.  All right.  We're going to Ziggy in D.C.  Ziggy.  Hey, morning, boys.  Hey.  I was wondering, is there a chapter in the book that describes how the fuck he survived combat 
[02:28:30]  missions in Nam, yet Waterfowl took his ass out?  Well, there probably is stuff about his war record.  I love the fact that it's with so-and-so.  Whenever it's with so-and-so, I doubt that he did much writing at all.  He probably just sat there with a tape recorder and told his life story, and this guy made  heads or tails out of it.  Yep.  That's how it works.  Fucking drool marks where he was falling asleep as he's writing out what Sully was saying.  And then, the next day, Al's a good co-pilot.  Sure he is. 
[02:29:00]  Time in Chicago.  What's the worst fart to all your co-pilots?  Anyone ever shart on a flight?  That's what I want to hear.  Do you ever wake up and get your dick sucked by your co-pilot and just keep it under your  hat because it was a long flight?  You ever make your co-pilot suck your dick?  Yeah, he's going to have a chapter on that, Jimmy.  Wouldn't that be great?  Smelling my co-pilot seat.  You ever get caught leaning over and taking a sniff?  Leaving greasy, greasy ball mark impressions on the windshield for the next crew. 
[02:29:30]  It's one of the funny things pilots do that no one knows about.  Where they'll open their asshole and they'll wrap it around the knob that the next guy has  to touch.  His throttle.  He smells his hand and goes, fucking Sully.  Ah, that damn Sully.  Got me again.  He's a guard.  I was wondering why there was a lima bean on top of the throttle.  Go ahead, sir.  Hey, he stunk throttled me.  He's got names for all their little gags. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah.  Like when you fuck with the fuel gauge, so you think you have plenty of fuel when you  don't.  You're over a major city and you run out of gas.  And you're like, oh, that's Sully.  You fucking glue goose feet around the engine intakes.  Or you fuck with the recordings, so whenever there's wind shearer, it goes, your mother's  a cunt.  Your mother's a cunt.  Little wacky pilot tricks. 
[02:30:30]  Yes.  Things we never knew about.  Go ahead, sir.  Tom in Chicago.  Hi.  You're bashing the inventor of the latest Craze Among Geese, a new game where they fly  in a circle and play Duck, Duck, Sully.  Boo.  That one went in.  There were no survivors.  Exactly.  There's 1,100 men going to water.  All of them drown myself out.  It's contagious, sir. 
[02:31:00]  I caught your bombitis.  I wish Sully was flying Henry Blake home.  Shot down over Hudson River.  There were plenty of survivors.  A geese hit his engine.  He spun in.  A geese hit his engine.  A geese.  It was just one.  Yes, it was geese Osby of the Harlem Globetrotters.  It was conjoined geese. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, boy.  Stephen S. from Bayshore.  Sully's book, From Hair Lip to Hero.  Does he have a hair lip?  Does he?  He might be hiding something with that mustache.  We should take a break.  Phew, yeah.  Gotta eat.  So we can breathe a little bit.  Take us out there, Travis.  Moving right along with the O.P. and Anthony show.  Not much else in the news, to be honest with you. 
[02:32:00]  I like eating in fucking 3.6 minutes.  It's just amazing, right?  Wonderful.  It's what you gotta do.  Yesterday, Ted was talking dirty on the phone, I believe, right?  Where are you, Jimmy?  Oh, my goodness.  How am I here, bud?  Yeah, the boys took your audio and made a little something-something.  I want to play right now for everybody.  And then we'll do other things.  Are you looking for some hard, hot action? 
[02:32:30]  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  I have a big one, Heather.  Let me swallow that fucking dick down my throat.  I'm gonna put it in you.  Oh, yeah.  And just give it to you until you're dead.  Are you looking to get turned on like a light bulb?  Oh, my pussy is so wet.  It's dripping now.  I want you to be so wet that it looks like a lake down there.  The Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium will connect you one-on-one for a private party with the man himself.  I'm gonna spank you, madam. 
[02:33:00]  You've been very bad.  You killed an old lady with a hammer, and I'm going to spank you, brother.  Spank it hard.  It's the wildest, all-live action with one hot, developmentally disabled entrepreneur with a mustache.  I'm going to lick the little man of the boat until my tongue is chapped and dry and smelt.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, my quits are swollen.  I'm gonna come soon.  That's right, madam.  I'm going to make you cum so hard that people are like, hey, there's a Niagara Falls in that lady's underpants. 
[02:33:30]  You're in for one mediocre time.  Yeah, I'm going to cum on your face.  Oh, sweet lady.  I want you to cum so hard that your cancer wing falls off.  Oh, my God.  Rub it.  Rub it quicker.  Rub it so fast that people think it's lazy.  Just sit back, relax, and whip it out.  Until you're cumming like nobody's business.  It's the Ted Sheckler Verbal Intercourse Emporium.  Good job, Ted.  Holy shit, is that real good. 
[02:34:00]  That's real fucking good, man.  Oh, Ted stinks in bed.  Ted really is awful.  It's horrible.  He actually did a good job there.  She got off.  I don't think it had anything to do with Ted.  You think Ted helped?  No.  It's so hard until her cancer wing falls off.  Jesus.  Why'd you cum so hard your cancer wing falls off?  I don't know why Ted said that.  It's a hard cum, though.  Ted ain't like it. 
[02:34:30]  She'd be shaking.  Well, we got a Boy Scout that was suspended from school.  Uh-oh.  Oh, Uncle Paul.  They're taking care of the real problems in this country.  Thank God.  Listen to this.  A Delaware Cub Scout's excitement over a prize is getting impunished and national headlines.  The Christina School District suspended six-year-old Zachary Christie for 45 days.  Excited about joining the Cub Scouts, he brought this combination fork-spoon-knife camping tool to school to use at lunch. 
[02:35:00]  Zachary is a first grader at Downs Elementary in Newark.  The school district calls it a dangerous instrument and has a zero-tolerance policy on weapons.  I agree with zero-tolerance where it's needed, but I also agree with a leveraged approach to that.  You know, you can't have...  You can't agree with zero-tolerance with a leveraged approach to that.  No, no.  It's one or the other.  It's either one or the other.  You don't agree with zero-tolerance is what you meant to say.  Oh, my God.  Oh, look at the little knife, fork, and... 
[02:35:30]  I had one of those.  ...fucking spoon thingy.  And I brought it to school.  Yeah, you could bring those to school.  I used to wear, like, a buck knife on my belt.  Right.  And go to school like that.  That zero-tolerance policy, I mean, you know, let's state the obvious, is just so dumb.  You know it again.  A six-year-old.  What, really?  You really think the six-year-old was, what, going to stab up the whole school?  Yeah, that's what's going to happen.  Poke them all to death?  ...calls it a dangerous instrument and has a zero-tolerance policy on weapons. 
[02:36:00]  Oh, look at the kid.  I agree with zero-tolerance where it's needed, but I also agree with a leveraged approach to that.  You know, you can't have, you know, a black-and-white rule that it's not one-size-fits-all.  If you bring one of these instruments to school, then there's a certain kind of consequence that the student will face.  Zach's mom is homeschooling him instead of sending him to reform school for 45 days.  She's fighting to overturn the ruling.  So what do you think?  Did a local school district go too far suspending a six-year-old for 45 days for bringing a camping utensil to school? 
[02:36:30]  92% say yes.  8% say no.  Yeah, suspension was overturned.  They did?  Yeah.  There's an update to the story?  They said that's ridiculous.  Yeah.  That's not, because it's not the intent to bring him.  He's trying to just bring his boys' kids stuff.  That's why they've gone to the point where they're not looking at intent.  They're not looking at anything.  Half of the pictures that kids draw get them in trouble.  Yeah.  I remember shit you used to draw. 
[02:37:00]  Oh, fuck yeah.  I would sit there and draw, like, machine guns shooting people.  Guns shooting people, flames, smoke.  You'd go, like, you'd go, as you're drawing, you talk.  You'd go, like, and then you'd go, and the guy would, like, you'd draw him falling down with blood squirting out of his head.  Now they would look at you, kick you out of school, send you to a shrink.  Mm-hmm.  Let's go to Cody.  Cody's got something on this.  Cody.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Cody. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, Martin.  Yeah, when I was, like, six, I was in kindergarten.  We got, for our birthday, we got to pick out of this bag all kinds of different toys.  One of the toys was a little knife.  That was, like, a fuck knife type deal.  I got that from my teacher when I was a kid.  Now those kids get in the boot.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, you know.  You're already so thick you can cut it with a knife.  Hey, true.  Cody hung up. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, that shit gets in trouble now.  That gets in trouble.  You used to be able to bring things, you know.  You brought some cool stuff for show and tell, right?  Yeah.  There was always some good stuff in show and tell.  Zero tolerance policies are fucking bullshit.  Just use your fucking brain.  That's all you have to do.  Speaking of schools, now here's a much better school story than that.  That one is, like, whatever.  Glad it worked out the right way in that little fella's case.  Yeah, this is very sexy, actually.  Listen to this. 
[02:38:30]  The parents finding out that an apparent career pedophile has been working as a groundskeeper  on school athletic fields at Rocky Point's elementary, middle, and high schools was sickening,  to say the least.  I mean, he's been working for the school district for eight years now, you know, and nobody knew  about it.  Police say a victim.  That means the guy's not a problem.  I guess he's fine.  Eight years, no one knew about it.  That's good.  I'm hoping to be the, you know, right now I'm the assistant greenskeeper.  That's great.  Good.  It's good. 
[02:39:00]  He's not a problem.  You know, and nobody knew about it.  Police say a victim who was abused when he was 11 years old back in the 80s finally had  the courage to come forward.  It was info he provided that led detectives to the Sound Beach home of 46-year-old Steven  DeTorris.  Police are not releasing this photo tonight as the investigation continues.  They say DeTorris admitted to having a collection of child pornography that he kept hidden, buried  in his backyard.  Oops.  Oh.  Like a treasure.  What do you admit to that?  Like a treasure chest.  Yeah, why would you admit to that?  Let them find it themselves.  Hi, uh...  Why would you make it easy for them?  Uh-huh. 
[02:39:30]  There's reports that you're...  It's buried in the yard!  You're late on your taxes.  Oh, shit.  The porno's buried in the yard.  Have them awkwardly dig up your whole backyard with some fucking tractor.  I have a photo of a bunch of lads!  The lads are doing illicit things.  Youngsters.  There was a story.  This guy, he rang up a bar tab about 50-some-odd bucks.  Oh, shit.  And, uh...  He, uh... 
[02:40:00]  Couldn't pay it.  So he said, I'll leave my cell phone as collateral.  And, um...  The bar attender was saying, he just looked to try to find the guy's phone number to call  him back to see, you know, if he's coming in with the money.  But, of course, he ends up in the guy's photo section.  They found some shit?  Finds a bunch of kiddie porn.  And, of course, when the guy came back, the police were waiting for him.  Arrested him.  And then they went to his home computer, which was just like, ooh, smorgasbord. 
[02:40:30]  Smorgasbord.  Fucking young children.  Was it any porn just spilling out of the home computer?  I was just falling out, literally.  What he should have done is, when he drove back by that bar and saw three squad cars,  he should have amscrayed home, hid the computer, and then said, I didn't load that stuff on  my phone.  Somebody else did.  Yeah, what an idiot.  Just pull your hard drives, throw them in the water.  No, I mean save them, but somewhere.  Why?  You got all that work of gathering up all those luscious photos. 
[02:41:00]  Renaming them all.  Things that don't sound like child porn.  You know?  I think the forensics people can figure that out.  Oh, they can?  Yeah.  You're not going to throw them off.  Yeah.  I always change the wording.  It's spelled kids, but with a Z, not an S.  That'll fool them.  Well, let's find out more about the groundskeeper here.  Police dug up lewd Polaroid photos of several young boys in compromising positions.  He was certainly there when they were taken, if he didn't take them. 
[02:41:30]  Police are trying to figure out who the other children in the photos are.  They also want to hear from any student that may have recently had contact with DeTouris  at one of the schools.  The district says DeTouris had a clean record when he was hired in 2001.  Police say it appears he got rid of his home computer before they can examine it forensically  for any child pornography.  He won't be facing any criminal charges for any sex acts that took place in the 80s because  the statute of limitations has run out, but he is being charged with possessing child pornography.  Oh, shit.  He threw his computer out. 
[02:42:00]  You know how much stuff he had on that?  Would you throw the whole kit and caboodle and put it in the lake?  You'd think he had a good cry as he's throwing it in the lake.  And they knew he had a computer because it was like a dust imprint of where it was.  And there's like speakers set up and just no computer.  Just a keyboard.  The carpet's got little dents in it where it was sitting on the feet.  The underside of the desk looks like a fucking inside of the cave.  Jesus Christ.  Let's go to Bill in St. Louis.  Bill? 
[02:42:30]  Hello, Bill.  Hello.  Hey, Bill.  Hey, I just wanted to comment on this whole thing with the kid with the knife.  When I was a kid, we used to have the show and tell deal.  Sure.  And for, let's see, we were studying the Civil War, and I had an old Civil War rifle that  I rode the bi-state bus, which is a public bus to school, had it in a black plastic bag, 
[02:43:00]  carried it on the bus to school, showed it off, and took it back.  And there was never even, well, I did get looked at it a couple times, but it was no big deal.  Oh, my God.  Could you tell that story again, but tell it as you're falling out of a window?  He wouldn't get a lot of the story out, though, Jimmy, if he did it that way. 
[02:43:30]  He'd have to talk real fast.  Marcel writes, imagine having to dig up your backyard just to jerk off.  Good point, mime.  What a pain in the ass that would be.  Yeah, times are different.  I guess that's what he was getting at.  John, what do you got?  Hey, guys.  Happy birthday, Opie.  Oh, thank you.  Opie, I'm about your age. 
[02:44:00]  I'm 30, no, I'm 40 years old, 34 years ago, first grade.  All right, you've got a few years already.  Kids picking on me on the bus.  I go home crying.  Mom tells me, hey, you don't take that off anybody.  Next time he picks on you, it's a fourth grade.  He said, you knock him on in the nose.  So I did the next day.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What happened to you?  Nothing, right?  Of course, bus driver takes me to the principal.  Principal calls my mom in.  She tells the principal, you know, she goes after her principal for not protecting me.  If that happened today, they'd probably take me away, you know, from my mom, put her in jail for, you know, child abuse. 
[02:44:30]  Now, is that really your story, or did you get that off mostuneventfulstories.com?  Oh, my God.  No beginning, middle, or end to it.  I'm sorry, Jimmy.  I was trying to make it fast.  I'm just kidding.  That story stunk.  That is so fucking funny.  You are so fucking mean. 
[02:45:00]  Take your life lesson and set yourself on fire.  Oh, God.  I'm just teasing.  Sean in North Carolina.  Sean.  Morning, Opie.  Hey, Sean.  I'm finding some inconsistencies with this guy's thinking.  Yep.  He felt it okay to leave pictures on his phone, but yet he digs a fucking hole to bury pictures in his backyard.  They're different guys.  Different guys.  The phone guy.  Ant was telling the phone guy's story.  Yeah, Ant was telling the phone guy, his quote-unquote friend, and by the time he left his phone in a bar, of course. 
[02:45:30]  And the other one was a groundskeeper.  Well, then your phone screener needs to tell me to shut the fuck up.  Oh, shit, Travis.  He's going after you.  Oh, no.  How about we do?  That's right.  I forgot.  Let's go to this guy.  This guy.  What do you got?  Hey, it's Andy.  Anyway, I was in a library on the outskirts of Cleveland, and this guy is sitting in the library computer lab looking at... 
[02:46:00]  Where the hell were you?  I was in Lakewood, Ohio.  You've been there, Jimmy.  I think you played there.  Yeah, I did.  The Lakewood Civic Auditorium.  What place were you there?  I couldn't hear you.  I was in a public library.  Okay.  And I was at the computer lab, and this guy is sitting at three screens over from me, and he is looking at this website called Boys on Your Screen.  And this guy looks like he got out of a 70s fitness video.  He's wearing the two short shorts with the striped socks and the creepy mustache, and he just screams pedal. 
[02:46:30]  I go up to the tech director.  I say, look at this guy.  This guy is looking at this website.  That's like all soft core boy porn.  Holy shit, Danny's getting the website.  Like artistic boy shots and shit like that.  And the guy at the tech desk said they couldn't touch him.  They wouldn't do anything to this guy.  Really?  Why not?  Oh, Jesus.  There's a fucking room, and this guy is just sitting there having a field day looking at his website.  It was just, ugh. 
[02:47:00]  Yeah, there's those weird ones that are kind of questionable but not illegal.  Provocative.  Well, we're on one of those sites right now.  Wait, go down.  There's some titles.  We could try The Horse Boy.  Want to try The Horse Boy?  Oh, I don't want to hear about a boy with a sore throat.  They're showing little, like, boy faces in the shower or something.  Of course it's a 404 not found.  It's an error.  Fuck.  So you're going to fucking prison error? 
[02:47:30]  Well, guys, we're waiting for Steve C. in 2014 at the game.  I'm punching out.  Yeah, I think he's not working today.  I'm not sure, though.  That's sad.  Maury's very sad.  Damn, that's hot.  What is that?  Let's see.  People really love their young boys.  I don't get it.  Let's say hi to Kim in New York.  Kim.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey.  Oh, happy birthday. 
[02:48:00]  So listen to, I work for an airline, and I do an Asian flight, and this guy from the  UN, who is an ambassador, was going to Malaysia, and they stopped him in security because they  saw, like, a knife or something.  Pulled out, opened up his bag, went through it.  Full-blown kiddie porn.  And he said it was for research.  He was some doctor or something, a PhD, you know, quote-unquote doctor for his research.  Why the fuck?  Pretty hard dick.  Did they arrest him? 
[02:48:30]  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Took him out and everything.  If you're going to an Asian country, why would you fly with kitty porn?  Exactly.  When you get there.  Yeah, that's why you're going.  It's like bringing steak to Morton's.  I knew there was something there.  We've got some guys, like, we know, the guys we check in that are single, going to, like,  the Philippines, or, you know, it's just like, they give you the ick, and it's like,  oh, God, we know what you're going over there for.  We've all come across the person in your life to go, yeah, I'm going to Thailand because  I like the beaches.  And you have to look the other way like, oh, okay. 
[02:49:00]  I'd like to see the people.  Yeah, that's why you're going there.  Close to God.  Yeah, right.  Right.  So do you, who do you work for?  Singapore Air?  No, I work for Cathay Pacific.  Oh, my God.  Cathay Pacific, they're supposed to be one of the best.  Oh, it's a great carrier, but we take anybody.  We don't discriminate.  No, but they're supposed to be one of the best airlines in the world.  Why?  Cathay Pacific, they have an amazing first class.  The food is supposed to be, yeah, it's like them and Emirates are supposed to be like  the two best.  What makes first class amazing, Jimmy?  Lie back seats.  Oh, it's first class all the way.  Get your butts over there.  Get your butts over there, guy. 
[02:49:30]  Where do you guys fly?  Where does Cathay, I would love to fly Cathay Pacific, but I don't go where they go.  Where's, like, a typical flight?  To Hong Kong.  Well, you can fly actually at night.  You can go to Vancouver.  How much is a flight from JFK to Hong Kong first class?  Oh, it's a lot.  How much?  About five grand.  It's got to be more than that.  Because LA, United, I mean, especially United flights from JFK to LA are 5,000.  No, they're not.  Yes, they are. 
[02:50:00]  No, they're not.  On the premium service, it's 5,000.  I don't pay it.  You told a round trip or one way?  Round trip, right?  Oh, a round trip, yes.  Yeah, a round trip, about eight, nine grand.  Oh, okay, okay.  But yeah, round trip, round trip on a first class to LA is not that much money.  It's a lot of shekels.  Have a great, well, come and see ya.  Have fun.  I would love to go on Cathay Pacific flight.  Do you do a flight a week?  How many times do you fly to Hong Kong in a week?  Well, they fly twice. 
[02:50:30]  We fly twice a day, direct.  You personally.  You personally.  No, I'm ground staff.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, okay.  I'm not up in the air, yeah.  Can you get me upgraded?  Maybe.  Be nice.  Always be nice.  Be nice to your checking agents.  That's the best advice I can give anybody out there.  Be nice, because you never know when we're looking for upgrades.  Yeah, but they go with frequent flyers and stuff first.  I need a connection.  Yeah, but sometimes we're chock-a-block full, and we upgrade about 20 people.  So, always be nice to your checking agents. 
[02:51:00]  You never know.  Okay.  Can we bribe them?  Does that ever work?  Yeah, sure.  We love bribes.  We love gifts.  All right.  Well, you have a great airline of her.  I'd love to fly it someday.  Them and Singapore Air are two airlines, and Emirates.  I'm dying to fly Emirates.  Why would you go there?  Come at night and go to Vancouver?  Yeah, why would you go there?  Oh, Vancouver from where, miss?  From New York.  Oh, from?  The night flight stops in Vancouver, and then from Vancouver we go to Hong Kong.  So, you can go next year for the Olympics.  Oh, or I could go do a gig in Vancouver.  All right.  I could fly. 
[02:51:30]  How much is it?  It's nice.  I was going to say.  How much from JFK to Vancouver?  Oh, I'm sure we'll get you a special price.  How would I know how to talk to you, then?  It's cheaper than Halloween costumes.  Are you talking to a travel agent on our show?  I'm sorry.  It's a travel agent.  She's done this after the show.  No, she works for the airline.  Right.  All right.  Whatever.  A glorified fucking travel agent.  Thank you, Kim.  Okay.  I'm at therealjimnorton at gmail.com.  If you help me get an upgrade or whatever, I'll send you pictures of my dick.  That's a good trade-off. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  You notice it won't be mine.  It'll be darker and bigger.  And now this.  More turgid.  The Kansas City man finds a racial slur printed on his receipt after returning a pair of shoes  that he bought over the weekend.  Tonight, he and his family want answers.  Larry, on Friday, 22-year-old Keith Slater bought a pair of shoes at a store called Journeys  here at Oak Park Mall.  Now, he eventually returned those shoes after finding a cheaper pair at another store.  And he did get his money back, but his family says he also got a disturbing receipt.  Oh, my God. 
[02:52:30]  What?  That makes me upset.  I don't want to look at that.  That makes me so upset.  Why would you say that?  I'd say J-O-B.  That's absolutely crazy.  That was the reaction on the street to what is printed on this piece of paper.  It is a receipt that 22-year-old Keith Slater got after returning a pair of shoes at Journeys  in Oak Park Mall.  His mother's reaction?  I mean, it, it, it, it.  You know, when he showed me their receipt, I couldn't believe it.  By the time they noticed the racial slur printed on the receipt, the store was already closed 
[02:53:00]  for the day.  It was the end word.  It just said nigger on it?  It was the end word.  How do we know?  This is why the news is such pieces of shit.  Yeah.  This guy, he probably didn't write it himself, but a guy can literally just write nigger on  the back of a receipt and it's a news story.  Yeah.  Like you, the media, you are such fucking, you're such garbage compared to what you used  to be.  Yeah.  That's a, it's, it's a non-story.  Offensive?  Sure.  To the person.  I'm not, I'm not saying it's not going to be offensive, but is it really a news story? 
[02:53:30]  Only if it's white on black, if it's the right.  And again, this is not about black people.  This is about the media.  The media is fucking just repugnant.  He couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it.  None of us got any sleep.  You know, it's just, you're not getting sleep because of it.  You're fucking kidding me.  Oh my God.  Just some asshole.  I'm worried so much about it.  He couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe it.  None of us got any sleep.  You know, just, just thinking about it.  The next day, hoping to get answers about how these hurtful words got here, the Slaters 
[02:54:00]  returned to the store.  Let's say they never got a full explanation, only that an employee entered the generic code.  And it pulled up that six, six or seven different choices and the choice.  Maybe it shouldn't be a choice.  All right.  Porch.  No.  Um, this one.  No.  Uh, no.  How is that a choice?  Six or seven choices.  In a fucking system.  All right.  Fuck you, asshole.  All right.  There it goes.  And it pulled up that six, six or seven different choices. 
[02:54:30]  And the choice that she chose was the very last choice.  I really don't doubt that this is the first time that it happened.  I'm sure it's happened before, but this is probably the first time that somebody actually  noticed their receipt and came back and, you know, asked about it.  Now the Slaters are waiting for answers.  To me, the appropriate thing to do, the first thing to do is to terminate the employee.  Because, I mean, it's just inappropriate for that to be there and then have that deleted  from their system. 
[02:55:00]  Fair enough.  What did it say?  And in case you're wondering, Mr. Slaughter's son is actually a college student down in  in Springfield.  And he was back here on fall break.  He has already gone back out of town to return to school.  So we didn't have a chance to talk with him.  We also went to Journey's today to try to talk with the employees there.  But no one at the store would speak to us.  So, wait.  This guy might have more info.  Jeremy in Kansas City.  Hey, Jeremy.  Yeah.  This happened several months ago.  I don't know why you all just got it now.  We're idiots. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah.  We're not...  The funny part about this story was the guy didn't write it on there.  It was actually on the computer and it was printed on the receipt.  Like part of the bill.  What was printed?  What did it say?  It said nigger on the receipt.  It was printed?  But just that?  Or was there something in front of it?  It said words?  I don't know.  That's just what they showed on the news here a few months ago.  It was actually printed like it was part of the receipt.  Like part...  Oh, okay.  Like with, you know, bjeep, bjeep, bjeep, printed letters. 
[02:56:00]  It was part...  Yeah.  It looked like the official receipt and it said nigger.  It's pretty fucked up that that would be a choice in the system.  Yeah.  Especially for a return.  Oh, no.  They said they thought that it was like a manager was disgruntled or something.  Somebody put it in the register.  So, when something happens, you hit a certain key, that comes up.  And somebody probably hit the wrong key and didn't notice.  And why are we speculating?  Who cares?  Yeah.  Gotcha.  But that's all I got.  Thanks, boys.  All right, Jeremy.  Thank you.  Unless it was a really good cash register from like 1850. 
[02:56:30]  Yeah.  And maybe that's...  Reason for arrest.  Purchased one.  Yes.  One knee groan.  Oh, the word dumb was in there, too.  Oh, was it?  Oh, dumb.  Okay.  Hence them saying that the kid was, you know, in college.  Oh, all right.  From break and back to college and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They don't need to fucking say that the kid was a college student because the receipt 
[02:57:00]  said that.  Like, that gives validity to the receipt.  Nobody was really thinking that that's what he was.  That's an ignorant statement by some manager who was mad.  You don't need to go by the way he's a college student.  Even if he wasn't a college student, that wouldn't be appropriate.  Every time there has to be a thing.  Well, he was on the honor roll.  And there's things that have nothing to do with the story.  Yeah.  He was well-liked in the neighborhood.  Yeah, really?  That's right.  Why was he burned by the residents?  By one person, apparently. 
[02:57:30]  Oh, Tom Ladd's got it all figured out in Chicago.  Nice name.  Actually, the skew for those shoes is N1663R.  Oh.  So, that's where the confusion is.  Oh.  It's pretty funny.  Yeah.  What?  You said home.  Didn't you say home?  I meant to say something, but then I thought I forgot.  Then he thought better of it.  I forgot.  All right.  A bit of a strange one, a midget's race at a race meeting in Victoria 
[02:58:00]  has sparked plenty of debate this morning.  Thousands of racegoers at Crownbourne watched the event  where punters piggybacked dwarfs over 50 metres racing.  Well, what else are you going to use a dwarf for?  Piggybacked dwarfs, eh?  I know.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Little buggers.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know.  We're racing midgets today.  I know.  I know. 
[02:58:30]  I know.  Here we go again.  Let's race him.  See if we can shove a didgeridoo up his ass.  Hi-ya.  Midgets.  Wow.  Over 50 metres.  Racing Victoria approved the stunt and claims it was just a bit of fun.  One person fell and crashed into the turf but was not hurt.  Victoria's racing minister, Rob Hull, says the race was an embarrassment  and does nothing to promote the racing industry. 
[02:59:00]  But champion jockey Damien Oliver reckons people should just lighten up.  What do you think?  Is it fun?  Is it offensive?  You would think those involved could say whether it's offensive or not, couldn't you?  Well, they haven't kicked up a fuss, so I don't know.  They gave consent?  Yeah.  Though no-one forced them to do it.  They weren't rubbed into anything, I wouldn't expect them.  What is it that we analyse humour so much now?  Can't we just, if you don't have a sense of humour about something, just move on rather 
[02:59:30]  than let's just overanalyse it?  How different is it to, we covered the wife-carrying races, remember in, where were they?  Norway or somewhere like that just a couple of weeks ago on the news.  Is that any different?  Does that demean wives that they're being carried?  Or is it just a bit of fun?  Then they'd beat him silly once they got him pierced the finish line, eh?  His accent is wacky, but he makes a great point.  Why do we analyse humour?  Just if you don't think it's funny and move on. 
[03:00:00]  Don't understand it.  That's a perfect statement.  Blackface is funny too.  When they put on the blackface, do the Michael Jackson bit.  CNN's doing a whole piece on that today.  Are they?  Why?  Is blackface ever funny?  Yes!  They're making fun of Michael Jackson and his shitty fucking white skin.  And then they went through the history of entertainment showing all the people doing the blackface thing.  It was not funny when it's used to discriminate against blacks or to be caricaturish or humiliating,  but if it's legitimately done to make fun of Michael Jackson and the fact that he was no longer black, it's acceptable. 
[03:00:30]  Fuck him.  God, I'm sick of the fucking hypersensitivity when it comes to this guy.  Fuck him.  Yeah, but Harry Connick Jr. was not happy.  Fuck him too and his stinky music.  He wasn't happy.  What a bore he is.  You know what that whole thing was?  He was just like, this is going to get me fucked if I sit here and just, you know, don't say anything.  But he has no ass to save.  Where the fuck has he been for the last 10 years?  He has real strong ties to New Orleans and shit. 
[03:01:00]  He's a crooner.  He's got a fucking crooner.  I'm a crooner.  I croon.  Can we hear a little Harry Connick Jr.  Oh, he's a fucking bore.  His shit is good.  His shit is not good.  He's the new crooner for a new generation.  God, is he fucking boring.  Yeah.  Ugh.  Like when he smashed into the canyon wall in Independence Day.  Yeah.  Harry Connick Jr. hit it. 
[03:01:30]  Listen to the crooner for the new generation.  Ugh.  I hate jazz drums.  You don't like this?  You're not even fucking playing.  What could possibly be wrong with this so far?  I could do this.  Jimmy can play this on drums.  He has.  Back.  Back at the New York roof.  Oh, here we go.  Dunk.  So easy to love.  Whoa.  Whoa.  So easy to idolize.  All others above. 
[03:02:00]  When someone farts.  So worth.  What year is it?  It's.  Yearning for.  He has a great voice, but it's boring music.  So swell.  Ugh.  To keep every home fire burning for.  We'd be so grand.  So happy together.  What music is. 
[03:02:30]  Some music is made for fucking.  Some is made for.  Driving fast.  What is this for?  I don't know.  Like you're hanging out around a fire.  It's made for dancing in a fucking ballroom party in the shining.  Yes.  Get some avocats spilt on you.  Yes.  Then you're taught how to murder your fucking wife and child with a fucking woodsman's weapon.  Woo.  Yeah. 
[03:03:00]  Are we done with Harry Connick Jr.?  Now what?  Does he just stand there while the band fucking does this self-indulgent bullshit?  Well.  Fucking jazz.  Jazz sucks a dick.  I think this one was aimed at Jimmy.  What is this?  Casey Wall writes, Opie, Harry Connick wasn't in Black Sabbath, so he couldn't be good.  No, I acknowledge that his voice is very good, but it's boring music.  I like it a lot more than Black Sabbath, mister. 
[03:03:30]  And the horn players are just looking at each other like, wow, that's great.  And everybody else is going, falling asleep.  Fuck.  Ugh.  I'm disgusted by this.  Jazz is weird, like, just people like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, like, loves, people love jazz.  I just can't get into it. 
[03:04:00]  Well, he was playing jazz as he's sticking broads.  If you're sticking broads, you throw a little jazz on.  Woody Allen loves jazz.  No.  What about Miles Davis?  Fuck him, too.  Oh, God.  Copper skin.  Exactly.  Well, Miles Davis?  Yeah.  Oh.  Why? 
[03:04:30]  Tony Bennett?  He did Kind of Blue or something like that.  One of the greatest albums ever, according to a lot of critics.  Blue, all right.  You want to hear a little Miles Davis?  Oh, sure.  Oh, God.  Travis, you got a little Miles Davis?  A little different than the Harry Connick Jr.  Here's Miles Davis.  What's the name of the big album?  Kind of Blue or something like that?  Yeah.  I'll do the same joke.  Kind of Blue.  It's the opening of a Pulp Fiction novel. 
[03:05:00]  People just love this.  She walked in.  She had a beautiful pair of stems.  She sat down and started spilling her problems to me.  I offered her a glass of scotch.  She took it.  Drank it faster than I did.  Seemed like a gal with big problems.  That's the only thing this music is good for. 
[03:05:30]  I lit up her cigarette and offered her one.  She took it.  Put it between her beautiful ruby red lips and lit up.  We started talking about her problems.  Seemed she was a dame that was in a lot of trouble.  She'd hooked up with a gentleman that wasn't quite as big a gentleman as he...  All right.  I like it.  This is not as bad.  This is not as bad.  I like this.  This is actually not as bad.  I'm going to close my eyes now. 
[03:06:00]  Anthony's reading me a story.  As she sat there...  Working garbage bars.  Swinging her stem back and forth.  Yeah.  With a red high-heeled shoe on it.  Yeah.  I couldn't help but look up at her big fucking hairy pussy.  Because, you know, it's back in the day where they didn't shave.  But this was a simpler time.  You can't say big hairy pussy.  They worked their way around that stuff.  Ah.  All right.  Looked like Rutherford B. Hayes under her dress.  He did have a big beard, right?  Yeah. 
[03:06:30]  I hope so.  I think so.  This stinks.  What's wrong with it?  No, this isn't that bad.  It's not my style, but at least it's tolerable.  This is background music to a Twilight Zone episode where a guy is walking down the street  with a fedora.  Jimmy, someone else going after you.  A guy named John writes, keep listening to your seventh grader metal.  Well, this doesn't make you more mature because you like this.  I acknowledge this is good.  It's not my style.  This was the great Miles Davis. 
[03:07:00]  Yeah, this is actually a lot better than...  This is terrible!  No, this isn't.  No, it's horrid!  No, you know why?  It's followable.  Like, you can follow why...  I can understand this nice horn playing.  It's not just a bunch of disjointed shit.  This is just slow.  No, this is jointed shit.  This is background stuff.  Nothing wrong with a little background music.  No, there's everything wrong with background music.  Background to what?  I don't mind this.  You know what?  Antony, I don't mind this.  This is terrible.  You know what?  When I'm tweeting my sunset pictures, I get inspiration. 
[03:07:30]  I put a little Miles Davis on the background.  You don't tweet sunset pictures.  It sets the mood.  I really hope you don't put on this music.  It sets the mood so I get the shot just right.  It's the mood for sleep.  I couldn't even sleep to this.  I'd be so annoyed and pissed off.  Now, the problem with this type of stuff, when you do put it on to nap, there's always  a part of it that just pops that wakes you right the fuck up.  Yeah, something like that.  You're like, what the fuck?  Let me tootally do to it.  Yeah, do a little tootally.  I don't even know it. 
[03:08:00]  Kevin from Connecticut writes, her eyes said no, but her clitoris said yes.  Tom in Chicago is going to educate us on jazz.  This break was meant to happen. 
[03:08:30]  Tom in Chicago.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Jim.  I'm probably going to get ripped a new one.  Hey, man.  Keep on the Miles Davis.  There's better musicianship when you're talking about jazz musicians.  They understand more about the music.  But that doesn't mean we're supposed to like it.  You're also talking about a lot of different types of jazz.  Let me ask you, too.  Obviously, you guys hate the big band stuff.  Who's the biggest, like, Buddy Rich was the jazz drummer? 
[03:09:00]  Who's one of the best drummers ever?  Right?  Buddy Rich was the biggest drummer, big band drummer.  Gene Krupa.  Oh, Krupa, yeah.  So those guys are pretty much the biggest drummers.  Yeah, they're good musicians.  I mean, you can't say they're not good musicians.  But it's self-indulgent.  Not many people enjoy this shit.  It's about taking something like Four Changes and seeing what they can do with it. 
[03:09:30]  What new melodies they can bring to the song.  What new ideas.  Yeah, man.  We need some new ideas, man.  New ideas.  Yeah, so they get five guys that are playing a different song, it sounds like, every fucking time.  You don't like this, Ant?  The drum is going off on something.  And the bass player.  And the horn player.  They're all playing something different.  You don't like this, though?  If I had to sit in a club and watch this band play, I would be heaving fucking rocks glasses at the trumpet player's head. 
[03:10:00]  What if a dame was tickling your balls, though?  Well, I'd feel good if a dame was tickling my balls.  While you're listening to this.  Yeah, she walked in.  The smell of whiskey breath was on my dick in two seconds.  She needed a private eye.  But she didn't have any bread.  No dough.  Cash.  I did it gratis.  We should just fucking play the whole album.  And just leave.  It would just sound like this.  And just leave.  Listen.  Okay, listen to the drums. 
[03:10:30]  I can do this.  And then listen to the piano.  They're not even doing the...  But you can't do that part.  That's the part.  The horn is great.  Yeah.  The horn is not great.  I could do the...  The horn is a horn.  Who cares?  It's got some feeling to it.  I don't mind Miles Davis.  I was wrong.  Compared to other stuff, I don't mind him.  Yeah.  And I typically loathe jazz.  He's dead.  He's not dead.  Yes, he is.  No, he's not.  Miles Davis is dead.  He lives on.  He lives on through his music. 
[03:11:00]  Does he?  Yeah.  All right, should we move on from this?  He's begging.  Why does it bother you so much?  Because it's not good.  This isn't good music.  All right, listen.  This could be a good exercise.  Matt in New York is into this.  So he has a request.  He goes, Opie, play flamenco sketches off Kind of Blue.  I bet it sounds exactly like what we're listening to right now.  Let's find out for Matt.  What's it called? 
[03:11:30]  Flamenco sketches.  Tell me when you change it because I won't know.  Flamenco sketches?  Yeah.  That sounds like a fucking character who hangs out with Ted and Uncle Paul.  Is this flamenco sketches?  Is it?  I don't know.  All right, all right.  Look.  Is this it?  Are you getting a thumbs up?  It's a continuation of the same song.  Yeah, 10 seconds ago.  What?  Really?  You changed it 10 seconds ago?  Why are you requesting this? 
[03:12:00]  We already had this song on.  This song was on.  What makes this any better or worse or different than the last song?  I have to say I like it.  I'm dead serious.  Seriously.  I didn't like Harry Connick Jr.  I thought he stunk.  All right, shut up with this lousy horn.  How do you listen to this at L.A.?  Well, while the coffee's brewing on a Sunday.  Fuck that noise.  And you got your shudoku puzzle.  You put on world's wildest police chases.  It's fun. 
[03:12:30]  Fun to watch.  Love that show.  Do you?  Yes.  You like when they crash?  Oh, they're great.  When they try to run out on foot.  Cop tases them.  That's fun.  That's background.  It's such a no win when you're running on foot.  Stop running from the police, you dummy.  Just pull over and behave.  The helicopter's chasing them.  You got to hear Don of Georgia.  Don, what do you got?  As you listen to Kind of Blue stuff from Miles Davis.  Yeah.  Happy birthday, uni.  All right, all right. 
[03:13:00]  Hey, I was going to say, every time I hear this shit,  I can think about it.  Charlie Brown, the line is looking for a goddamn Christmas tree.  Yeah, that's what it sounds like.  Yeah.  See, that's a good line right there.  What's this song?  This is flamenco sketches.  What is that?  Who's flamenco?  What is it mean?  What is he drawing?  Who gives a shit?  I don't know.  Vulture Squad wants in on our jazz break.  Hey.  Vulture Squad.  Talk jazzy, will ya?  I got two fun jazz facts for you this morning. 
[03:13:30]  Scooby-Doo.  All right, Scooby-Doo.  The first one is the acclaimed drummer, Buddy Rich,  used to play with his hands,  and everyone thought that was real cool,  but he did that because he couldn't hold the drumsticks  after shooting up so many times.  He lost all the veins in his arms.  Yeah, they did.  All right, the other thing,  so the other thing is John Coltrane, right?  Yes.  Everyone thinks John Coltrane was a poor black man  playing in the ghetto, right?  Lived in the ghetto.  He lived in Dix Hills in one of the biggest houses of his time, 
[03:14:00]  and he had a state-of-the-art recording studio in his basement.  Doesn't matter?  That's what I got for you.  Let's just, jazz is the big lie.  Everybody wants to like it if it's in the ghetto.  Jazz is a big lie.  I don't know, sir.  A lot of the stars like their hair on.  Yeah.  They enjoy their hair on.  She was blues.  Is Miles Davis blues or jazz or both?  Well, he did some, what do you call it, fusion stuff?  What would you call it, Ant?  Shit! 
[03:14:30]  Utter shit!  I can't relax ever.  I can't, I hate this.  You need constant hardcore activity in your life.  No, no, I don't even like...  You never just put something on in the background?  It's kind of just there in the background?  Why can't you listen to like...  What do you put on in the background?  Background?  Sometimes it's good to have just background music.  Hitler speeches.  Man, those are good marches.  I would listen to just like fucking mellow rock more than this. 
[03:15:00]  Yeah, Nirvana Unplugged.  Yeah, that's good.  No, I'd listen to like even stupid soft rock would beat the shit out of this.  At least you could follow it.  Maybe get a burst of nostalgia in your head instead of this fucking garbage.  It's not supposed to make you angry.  It's, I am pissed off at this music.  The trumpet is drilling through my skull.  Let's go to Ryan.  Oh, he's probably got the fucking plunger thing on the front. 
[03:15:30]  Wah, wah.  Does he do that in one song?  What is it?  Wah, wah, wah.  The mute.  Is it called the mute?  I wish I was mute listening to this.  Well, I wouldn't be listening.  Hey, you can hear if you're mute.  It's if you're deaf that you can't hear.  Oh, really?  Yes.  You should have been mute when that joke was coming up.  I wish I was mute when I was listening to this.  So you couldn't voice your objections?  I have a tool.  Let's go to Dennis.  Dennis. 
[03:16:00]  Hey, what's up, boys?  You're listening to some real crap right now.  There's much better stuff out there.  Charlie Parker's ornithology solo is very...  This is crap.  I bet you if we put the Charlie Parker song on, we wouldn't even know when Travis, like,  sang into the Charlie Parker song.  Oh, it's way faster.  Wait, well, Bob Eaton's here.  Let's get Bob's opinion.  Bob plays...  Oh, he does.  Oh.  Bob is here.  We should ask him about jazz.  I guess we're starting Halloween early, huh?  Yes.  Oh, God. 
[03:16:30]  You want Bob on the radio?  Yes.  Really?  All right.  His mic's on.  Yes.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  The second he starts talking, I'm going to be...  Could you put the jazz back on?  Where is he?  He can't open the door.  He's weak.  Why does he want to come on?  What's he doing?  You want to talk about jazz, Bob?  We're talking about jazz.  We're talking about jazz.  Why?  We need your opinion.  Classical?  Classical? 
[03:17:00]  Holy shit.  Is this the French horn?  He plays the French horn.  I know he does.  That's what he calls it.  Two glory holes.  He likes his French horn.  He sure does.  And then his French frosting shot out of the horn all over his cheeks.  Oh, shit.  Play the French.  All right.  We got Paul in New York.  We're getting somewhere with our jazz break.  Paul.  Hey, guys.  The music sounds like something Bobby Kelly would listen to.  It's not more interesting.  Dude, you put your coffee in.  You know what, dude?  It ebbs and flows. 
[03:17:30]  You sit down.  Boom.  You relax.  You know, you got your cup to eat.  You got your pound of marmalade.  All right.  Are we done with this?  Let's say hi to Jay in Virginia.  Jay?  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Hey.  As terrible as this sounds, Miles Davis did a cover of Time After Time by Cindy Lauper.  It's actually not bad.  And if you want some decent chill-out kind of rock, Mark Knopfler just did a cover of Brothers in Arms. 
[03:18:00]  It's his song, but he did it with the Philharmonic Orchestra, I think.  It's a really awesome plot.  All right.  This is drivel.  You want to hear Cindy Lauper?  Yeah.  No one hears Tyler.  I mean, Miles Davis do a little Cindy Lauper?  Yeah.  We got that, Travis.  Girls just want to have fun.  See Miles Davis do a song I didn't like when she did it.  This is Time After Time.  Yeah.  If this is her version, by the way, I'm going to kick Travis in his chest. 
[03:18:30]  No, you can already tell it's not, though.  It's Kenny G sounding shit.  Oh, my God.  It is Kenny G.  I feel like I'm in an elevator.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They're asking if they're in an elevator.  Yeah.  And you really want to get into some Miles Davis? 
[03:19:00]  John in Georgia says we should play Bitches Brew for you.  The first abstract jazz fusion song.  Oh, I bet that's great.  Bitches Brew.  Is this it?  Yeah.  Put on Bitches Brew, Travis.  All right.  Here's Bitches Brew for Anthony.  The first abstract jazz fusion.  By the way, the guy.  Oh.  Are you kidding?  By the way, the guy that suggested that last song is a homo. 
[03:19:30]  Yeah.  That's a little weird to like that.  It's 26 minutes long.  It's 26 minutes of this shit.  I guess we'll see you tomorrow.  Who?  Look.  Listen, there's some jazz fusion going on.  They're mixing some.  They're not playing the same time.  I could play with this.  I could play this.  They're mixing some shit up here.  I don't play an instrument.  I could grab the bass and play the bass.  You got an instrument right in front of you.  I did totally do already. 
[03:20:00]  This is upsetting.  It sounds like the moment where Quincy is walking down the hall to confront somebody.  It's like this is the walking music.  Yes.  That's right.  Abigail.  Abigail.  They were trying to give her a lollipop overdose.  An overdose of Eatman.  They make Bob talk to her until she falls over and hits her head. 
[03:20:30]  Awful.  Why?  They got some stuff going on in here.  I don't know what it is, but.  Oh.  The instruments are talking to you.  There's no reason to listen to this.  It sounds like when the T-1000 is melting at the end of Terminator 2.  Yeah.  There's no reason for anyone to put this on and go, yeah. 
[03:21:00]  Unless you want a bad acid trip.  Like drop a head of acid, listen to this, and freak out.  You're going to have some good trips.  I had a dream.  I imagined a hot dog was talking to me.  That's what it sounds like, that music.  And when I bit into it, the hot dog screamed.  It said, don't eat me, I have a family.  How many minutes left in this? 
[03:21:30]  25.  Jimmy's not even looking anymore.  24.30.  24.30.  Is it getting good?  I don't hate it.  I honestly don't hate it.  But how do you know when it's getting good?  Jimmy, you're a weirdo.  Miles Davis, I don't hate it.  Jimmy's a weirdo.  No, the kind of blue wasn't bad.  I would never listen to this.  No.  I actually bought kind of blue by Miles Davis.  I don't think you're going to be seeing any Miles Davis rock band coming out.  No.  You know? 
[03:22:00]  Why not?  Because all you're going to have to do is bang on the fucking drums.  Your party would be very confused.  You wouldn't have to do anything.  Your party would just be very confused.  You'd rock every time because you could just bang on the instruments.  This is shit.  This should be called accidentally drop the equipment when it was plugged in.  Oh, this is a good point.  Mongo the trucker.  Mongo.  I think I know why Anthony doesn't like this.  Most of us use jazz to get our women in the mood, and he's used to using Spongebob.  Spongebob. 
[03:22:30]  Ooh.  Spongebob.  Let's go to Matt in Queensbury, Matt.  Spongebob's old now.  Hey, guys.  I think one of the problems here is none of this stuff has any guitar in it.  It's just all horns and bullshit.  If you check out, like, Vital Information, if you go to YouTube and look them up, they  have a song called Rattletrap.  If you skip to about 4.55, you can see the guitar player start soloing.  4.55?  It's probably the best guitar player you'll ever see.  That's usually the end of a song.  I shan't listen to that dribble. 
[03:23:00]  Look at the phones, though.  They all want to talk about it.  Our listeners are into the jazz scene, man.  No, they're not.  They hate it.  Look at them.  They're all into it.  Vital Information has Steve Smith on drums.  He used to play with Journey.  Steve Smith used to play with Journey?  Right.  Yeah.  And Neil Sean used to play with Santana.  Who gives a shit?  No, I'm telling you.  Check this out.  You like the talk?  No, it's horrible.  It's jazz.  Shut up.  Shut up.  I hate you.  Let's go to Michelle.  Michelle.  Tom and Jerry cartoons when you were a kid had the snow when Tom got kicked out of 
[03:23:30]  the townhouse, and they used to play this jazz, and it drove me crazy as a kid.  You were like on some sort of mind trip.  I don't know what you were writing.  Yeah, it is true.  Yeah, but Anthony loves cartoons, so you should be liking this stuff.  It should bring you back to the cartoons.  No, I like Bugs Bunny.  Do you remember this on Tom and Jerry, though, when they did this?  It was horrible.  Yeah, they used a lot of jazz in Tom and Jerry.  It was horrible.  Punch it out.  All right, Michelle.  Thank you.  We got a jazz guitarist.  Why don't you tell him what he does his shit for a living? 
[03:24:00]  It is.  Shane.  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Hope I could shed some light on this for you.  When jazz first started, it was like dance music, and that was like the 20s and 30s.  And as it evolved, it really became more of music for the people because these black artists  got sick and tired of playing their music for a white audience.  Oh, so it's got to be a racial thing.  Shut up and learn how to play the guitar.  Learn how to play the guitar.  Learn how to play real songs with melodies. 
[03:24:30]  Okay, I will.  There's no melody to this shit.  You can't sing along to this.  I'm singing along to jazz.  You want people to tweet some jazz suggestions for you today?  No.  Why?  Then you can have an open mind about this.  Patty, what's going on? 
[03:25:00]  Mine's open.  You're welcome to Starbucks.  How can I help you?  How can I take your order?  I'll take your order.  Punch it out.  Very good.  All right, this was our jazz break.  Yeah.  Oh, Howie likes us.  Howie in the city.  Howie.  That shit should be called, bitches.  A-boo.  Why?  We don't even know if it's good yet.  It's not even half over.  How many more minutes? 
[03:25:30]  We have 20 minutes left, guys.  Oh, 20 minutes to go in the song ad.  They felt it necessary for this to be 26 minutes long.  This is longer than, like, a sitcom without commercials.  Yeah, you could watch a whole Seinfeld episode.  I'd rather.  Yeah, of course you'd rather.  Any day.  One I've seen 800 times, which is all of them.  All right.  Should we take a break?  I popped in the box set the other day.  That, believe it or not, George Isn't at Home episode is so fucking funny. 
[03:26:00]  But where could I be?  And he shrugs his shoulders.  Right.  Fucking hysterical.  How do you not laugh every time at that?  I fucking love that one.  How important is this music?  Well, Larry King wants in.  Larry.  Hey, how important is this music when a new sheriff rides in a rock race?  A new sheriff a rocker is.  Nice.  Very good. 
[03:26:30]  And we got Bob Dylan checking in.  Mr. Dylan.  Hey, boys.  If you like this, you should check out my XM channel.  Team Time Radio Hour.  Dream, Steve, Steve.  Ooh.  Bob in Kansas City.  Bob.  Yeah, my dentist used to play this shit so he could put you to sleep in a chair before  he started.  In the chair.  Yeah.  You just sit in that chair.  Right now, boys.  All right.  Word to be shitty.  You know, the one person that liked this the most left the studio. 
[03:27:00]  Let it be known.  Jimmy left the studio.  He was the one that was enjoying this the most.  Eric in Boston.  Eric.  Hey, jazz sucks a dick.  Thank you.  RIP their cock off and shove up their ass.  Thank you.  And there you go.  You're so fucking right.  That will end our jazz break, Anthony.  Oh.  Our jazz break is done?  That was a good jazz break.  We're going to have to, like, add that to the repertoire. 
[03:27:30]  Look at this.  I got a text from my good friend, Patrice O'Neal.  Okay.  Jazz is whore fucking horrendous.  So why isn't he called the show?  What can you do to this shit?  Not dance, fuck, or drive.  You have to crawl inside these niggas to understand what they meant.  It's true.  He's right.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, what do you do to that music?  You, music needs to be, if it's going to be part of your life, you need, even if you're  just relaxing, you need, it needs to do something for you. 
[03:28:00]  You can't relax to this shit.  You're not sitting there.  No, you're not.  Not the jazz fusion, but the Miles Davis kind of blue.  You throw that on in the background.  Maybe.  But you don't get up early.  It's good getting up early music.  Getting up early.  You listen to that crap.  No.  I kill myself.  That's so depressing.  The prospect of being up early, listening to that, is depressing.  Patrice is calling my phone.  I said, call the show.  Patrice. 
[03:28:30]  What?  I was trying to call you, and I don't have the number to bypass all of them.  Oh, he doesn't have the hotline number.  I just need the number, because I really wanted to talk about being black and having  to like jazz, but I just fucking decided I don't.  You don't like the jazz, Patrice?  I'm doing it on the radio.  Yeah, we got you on the radio.  It's not the best way to get you on the radio, but.  Give me the fucking number.  All right, it's, uh, what's the number?  Can't give him the hotline number over the air.  What's the number, Danny? 
[03:29:00]  It's not a hotline anymore.  Two, one, two.  Two, one, two.  Oh, no.  No, no, don't say it.  Don't text it to me.  Text it.  All right.  Yeah, I'll text it to him.  All right, we're going to text it.  I'll text it to him.  How do you spell out eat a dick?  Write that.  Two, one, two, eat a dick.  Oh.  All right, Patrice, I'm going to.  Oh, you got.  Do you have his number?  I should, yeah.  All right.  I hope I do.  You text him?  That means we got to continue with our jazz break.  Scoody, wah, wah.  You don't like Miles Davis? 
[03:29:30]  Dude, what can you?  I try to have my, the only thing jazz is good for is to have jazzy shit around because  girls like it.  Jazzy shit.  I'm just a motherfucker with a horn.  It's just a pussy thing, but I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I used to think I was a white person for a long time because I could not figure out how  to like jazz.  It sucks. 
[03:30:00]  I hate it.  And I'm like, fuck it.  I'm 40 now.  Fuck it.  It can't stink.  Yeah, it does.  It stinks.  It does.  It doesn't serve any purpose.  With a room full of white guys just putting down jazz, but I just, I absolutely agree.  I can't, I don't get it.  Don't get it.  Can't do anything to it.  Really fucking felonious?  Really, motherfucker?  Eat ass, nigga.  You're not liking our jazz break?  It's horrible, man.  Fuck it.  It's horrible, no shit. 
[03:30:30]  I'm getting some enjoyment from this break.  I don't know why.  I like white boy drug music, but it's sad.  The fucking, the psychodelic drug.  These niggas should have took acid and they would have been having better music.  Heroin makes shit just too slow.  You gotta speed that shit up.  Nigga, I like Yellow Submarine better than this.  That's a horrible Beatles song.  At least they were high on something making that goofy shit.  Goodness gracious. 
[03:31:00]  Yeah.  It had like a melody.  I'll talk to you guys tomorrow.  I think I'm in tomorrow.  Oh, right on.  Cool, man.  Patrice O'Neal, everyone.  We'll see you tomorrow, Patrice.  There he goes.  Fuck it.  He's hating the jazz break.  Oh, it's, this music is, there's no melody to it is what it is.  I need a melodic song.  Well, this is disjointed shit.  Hey, Jimmy.  They're all playing something different.  I gotta ask Jimmy.  Jimmy, you left probably 10 minutes ago.  What have you been doing?  You went, took a leak.  No, I'm talking to Bob.  Said hi to Bob, right? 
[03:31:30]  The song still has, I don't know, it's only half over.  We've got 14 minutes left.  14 minutes.  Honestly.  It's officially not even half over.  And you just had a conversation with Bob.  I honestly don't hate this.  Honestly, no.  Listen.  Listen to the piano.  Or whatever the fuck that is.  And then listen to the bass.  And then listen to the brushes on the drums.  They're not fucking playing anything together. 
[03:32:00]  How'd you know all that was happening, you weirdo?  Because you could hear all the different fucking music.  And it stinks.  There's nothing being played melodic.  But on cue, you said that.  I know.  I'm amazing.  That was a little weird.  A melodic.  A mongrel.  It's terrible.  All right.  I think we got a fifth.  Oh, please.  We're done.  We're done with our jazz break.  Turn this shit off.  Larry King, everyone.  Larry.  Hey, boys.  Hey, Larry.  How important is the lack of melody and untuned instruments in jazz music? 
[03:32:30]  Go.  Yeah.  How important is the untuned instruments?  Very good.  Let's go to Larry King.  Larry.  Gentlemen.  Hey.  I know I've asked this a million times.  But how important is the listener to the show?  Yeah.  All right.  I hear that, too.  Tony in Brooklyn.  Tony.  Tony.  Yeah, Anthony.  You're forcing me to listen to your competitors with this music.  You're killing me here.  Anthony?  Yeah, Anthony.  What the fuck?  I didn't put this shit on, my friend.  What the fuck?  We wanted to do maybe a minute on this as a goof. 
[03:33:00]  Holy cow.  What the fuck?  The listener's confused.  Oh, get this stuff out of here, please.  Hey, man.  It wants it on.  What can I tell you?  No, I hate jazz.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Yeah, where's our turn it off clip?  We haven't played in a while.  Yeah.  Do we still have that one?  It's one of my favorites of all time.  Eric.  Hey, Opie.  Do we have to listen to the words? 
[03:33:30]  They aren't saying anything, man.  Oh, you guys want to listen to Frank Zappa?  Cyborgus?  No, he's another one that, like, his melodic stuff I liked, but then he got really crazy  into the jazzy shit.  Does an asshole hurt more and more?  Oh, jeez.  On a strap, two of Sully's books over my ears.  Zappa was scared of the fingers in his ass by the doctor. 
[03:34:00]  Oh, he didn't like it.  He avoided the doctor, and that got the best of him in the end.  I gotta pee.  Yeah, all right.  We're gonna take a break.  That'll conclude our jazz break.  I mean, look at the phones, though.  I think we gotta go down this road again.  No!  Maybe tomorrow, when Patrice is here, we can enjoy some more jazz.  They all hate it.  Oh, see you tomorrow?  Good.  I think so, yeah.  Cool.  All right.  Want to just play the song out, at least?  Yeah.  For the people that are enjoying it?  Oh, no, no.  Come on. 
[03:34:30]  Don't.  All right, Travis, get us out of here.  We'll be right back. </pre>
