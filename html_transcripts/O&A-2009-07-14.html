<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a lament about the decline of "regular radio," citing cost-cutting measures, firings, and the over-reliance on sports programming.  They contrasted this with their own, more creative (and arguably more offensive) style.  The conversation then turned to the recently deceased Michael Jackson, focusing on a tell-all biography hinting at his sexuality and Debbie Rowe's substantial financial settlement. A caller's poorly delivered joke about Jackson's death (food poisoning) followed.  The hosts extensively discussed Blanket Jackson's apparent fear of light and the potential for Joe Jackson to exploit him.  This transitioned into a discussion of a disastrous Cincinnati mayor's first pitch (a recurring joke).  The show then moved onto viral YouTube videos of "Fred," with several clips played and discussed, followed by more commentary on Michael Jackson's death, Joan Rivers' humor, the Home Run Derby, and a caller's tale of destroying a laptop in a swimming pool.  The segment concluded with musings on the long-term decay of structures, inspired by a documentary about life after humans.

This discussion of post-humanity continued into the next segment, posing a trivia question: what would be the last remaining evidence of human existence?  Answers ranged from felt hats to nuclear waste, with much debate on their durability.  A significant portion of the segment focused on Wendy Williams, with the hosts using highly offensive and graphic language to describe her appearance.  Similar remarks were made about other Black female celebrities.  Listener calls provided answers to the trivia question and further commentary on Wendy Williams, interspersed with a bit about a fictional intern, "Simple Mike," and his management style.  Ozzy Osbourne losing his dog was also mentioned.

The focus on Wendy Williams' appearance intensified in the following segment, with extended and vulgar discussion of her body and sexual performance, along with similar comments about the Williams sisters.  A phone call with Wendy Williams herself followed, where she defended herself against the hosts' insults.  Listener calls continued the sexually charged commentary.  A listener question about the longevity of materials led to calls with Dr. Michio Kaku and "Dr. Steve," who offered contrasting opinions on the reach of radio waves.  The conversation was punctuated with further vulgar commentary.  A WWE event and a Grand Canyon car accident were briefly mentioned.

The next segment was a rambling conversation encompassing several topics.  Along with an unidentified guest, the hosts continued their sexually charged opinions on Wendy Williams.  A lengthy, vulgar discussion about chewing gum, including the surprisingly durable nature of old baseball card gum, ensued.  Anthony's humorous car repair anecdote (using a coat hanger on his Shelby GT500 exhaust) was a highlight.  A Google search for “Wendy Williams is a monster” became a running joke.  A listener call, Anthony's upcoming IFC appearance, and speculation on a Boston radio station's format change were included.  The conversation shifted to the state of radio, criticizing current trends and the impact of lawyers.  This was followed by a brief showing of a Jeff Dunham video and discussion of various celebrities, including Jessica Simpson, Solange Knowles, and Kate Hudson.  A call from Marlena, sharing her breast cancer experience, was followed by more crude comments about Wendy Williams and a Six Flags commercial.

The final segment opened with dismissive commentary on a Housewives of New York clip, transitioning to Beyoncé and Solange, and then to free parking.  Rich Voss and Bonnie, described as "comedy's most dysfunctional married couple," were mentioned with graphic details.  A caller criticized the hosts' hypocrisy regarding Jeff Dunham.  The conversation shifted to Stephanie Courtney (Progressive commercials) with sexually suggestive comments, followed by crude jokes about Brooke Burke and other women.  The hosts debated covering a blogger's blowjob comment on MSNBC versus an Obama teleprompter malfunction, opting for the former.  A significant portion focused on conflict with staff member Eric ("E-Rock"), whose "horrendous" tweets and work ethic were heavily criticized with insults.  Steve's attire was also discussed with vulgar speculation. The segment concluded with the playing of a sexually explicit video, "Dinner Time," featuring graphic interracial sex and cuckolding, followed by further crude remarks and promotion of Z-Rock's IFC appearance.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  But enough of this palaver! Let's get the show on the road!  Ah!  Hey, it's Two for Tuesday. Nice.  Is that it?  Two for Tuesday.  Damn. Twice the fun.  That just makes the, um...  That makes the second day of the weekday that much better.  You think, well, Monday sucked, but at least it's Two for Tuesday.  Two furs!  Yuck. 
[00:00:30]  How's regular radio doing? Anyone know?  Aside from news, I couldn't even fucking tell you.  I'm a major radio guy.  I haven't listened to...  Major radio?  Colonel Television.  That's right.  Lieutenant C.B. in service.  The boot us.  The boot!  And, uh...  I don't remember the last time I listened to regular radio.  Except for maybe a little traffic and weather together on the 8s.  Yeah, that's it. That's the only thing I listen to.  What's the thing they like to do here in New York City? 
[00:01:00]  Give you a little traffic, a little weather?  Ah!  But you can only listen to that for, I don't know, 30 seconds.  I'm terrible, because I'll obsess on it like an infomercial,  where it's just the same thing.  They sing over and over again, and I'll just listen for the whole ride here and home.  I was reading radio headlines last night, though.  Oh!  And it's very funny, because this company's trying to hang on,  this company's trying this, hoping this will work,  and it's just a disaster.  They're trying all their cost-cutting things.  Oh, my God. 
[00:01:30]  Which means all the executives stay, the talent gets thrown out,  and they hire somebody for like $10 an hour to come in  and record like eight hours of programming in 15 minutes.  No, it's worse than that.  There's a major station in Chicago.  The headline was, they let 10 part-timers go.  That can't be good.  We're going to start firing the part-timers.  Part-timers?  I mean, part-timers, you know, notorious for working not many hours, obviously.  And for nothing.  And for no money.  So if you're firing those guys, how desperate are you? 
[00:02:00]  Yeah.  And also, JFK is going away, right?  In D.C., we'd heard that, and then I heard...  No, he was back in 60...  Not the president!  Yeah, he went away a long time ago.  Oh, no, no, I mean the station.  His head sploded.  You're a little off.  His head, it's floated.  That's right, he was laid on his hat payments in Oswald.  That's what people don't know.  He was trying to shoot his hat off.  His hat payments.  But he wasn't wearing a hat that day.  Well, that was Oswald's mistake.  He was very frequently known to remove the hat of a person not wearing it. 
[00:02:30]  But he wasn't wearing a hat that day.  Yeah.  It was...  Oh, I'm sorry, it was a wig shop.  Kennedy was wearing a wig that day.  He had actually a horseshoe.  He had Robert Duvall hair.  Gets the wig away.  So is that true?  Is JFK going away?  Is that another one?  Ah, they're going all sports.  They are, huh?  I think what you're going to find in the very near future  is a lot of FMs go in all sports.  Is that going to be the big thing that they're going to...  Here it is.  Here's the trend.  Oh, wow.  Because then it was talk for a while.  It was extreme talk.  It was FM talk.  It was this talk.  And now sports, I guess. 
[00:03:00]  It's going to be big.  They got rid of us here in New York City for...  What was it?  A pop format?  For, yeah, Britney Spears.  Not even a blip on the radio radar.  No.  And I'm hearing from a bunch of those people that we used to work for.  And they're all in hell.  Yeah, no shit.  I don't know what to tell you.  We were doing our job.  We gave them ratings in the morning.  But they couldn't pay us anymore.  And we weren't even asking for a lot.  And they were too worried about 23 more hours of programming.  But they really thought that a jukebox would get the job done. 
[00:03:30]  Not quite.  In the age of the iPhone and Pandora's box and whatnot.  Digital music.  Satellite radio, of course, yes.  Digital delivery of your music instantly.  What the fuck do you need?  Some goddamn station with some asshole jock.  It's so outdated, all that shit.  And, you know, the people that do have satellite radio, I got a new car and I got the satellite FM AM. 
[00:04:00]  That FM and AM button are starting to look really archaic.  Terrible.  It just feels archaic.  You don't want to push it.  If you get turned on to satellite radio, there's no reason to.  Dude, traffic and weather, like you said, that's why I honestly, I never go to radio for music.  It's literally, I'm going to go through the tunnel.  It's maybe 1010 or 880.  That's it.  Yep.  Because I'm just familiar with them.  Musically, never.  Fucking never.  That's it.  Yeah.  It's terrible.  AM radio for the traffic and news and then FM radio. 
[00:04:30]  I cannot tell you honestly when the last time I listened to FM radio in my car, at home, anywhere.  I used to love listening to radio, regular radio, especially when I was traveling because you never knew what the station was doing.  You never knew what the jocks would say.  And then these dumb PDs and the general managers and blah, blah, blah just shut everybody up and made it so predictable.  Predictable.  Yeah.  You just know you're not going to hear anything thought-provoking or interesting or creative anymore. 
[00:05:00]  You're going to hear a lot of sales-driven crap.  You're going to hear them trying to make money.  And it's never entertaining or fun when you're listening to people trying to make money.  It's really bad.  Are we petting the dog today?  Pet the dog.  Pet the dog.  It's not actually petting, and we gave him a little shuka-shuka under the chin.  We didn't even mean to pet the dog today. 
[00:05:30]  No.  This is like a little scratch on each side of the cheek.  Shuka-shuka on the side of the cheek.  Shuka-shuka.  And he thinks he's getting more, so he wags his tail, but then you just walk away.  And you stop and you just grab his little pink dick for a second and you tug it.  Just to make him feel silly.  Him?  It's true.  You're the one wiping dog dick slime on your jeans as you walk away.  Dog wins.  Dog wins.  Dog wins.  Dog wins.  AJ in Oklahoma, Jimmy.  Actually, JFK was late with his brain payments. 
[00:06:00]  We needed to take those brains back.  They repoed his brains.  Good news.  Michael Jackson.  We're going to find out how he died next week, finally.  Next week.  But pretty much...  Why does it take so fucking long with this shit?  They have to wait for the culture to grow in the slide, I guess.  Is that what it is?  I don't know.  The toxicology reports.  Well, the Michael Jackson slot machine had its first payoff, though.  The mother of the children.  Who's a beast.  Yeah.  She is not...  She stayed out in the sun way too long. 
[00:06:30]  I know she's an older broad now, but...  Wow.  She's got, like, leather face skin.  Very girl, though.  Debbie Rowe.  Apparently, and they're saying here on the cover of the post, sells Jacko kids.  Jacko.  Wacko Jacko.  They were never her kids.  Well, they...  I mean, she gave up her body, so Michael Jackson could have some kids.  They call her Michael Jackson's baby incubator.  The eyes on Debbie Rowe.  Yeah.  Just like Paris's.  Except a lot younger.  Oh, of course. 
[00:07:00]  This one, yeah.  She barbecued herself in the sun.  She's got that leather skin.  Four million bucks she gets.  In return, she will not seek custody of the kids.  That's something.  Good deal for her.  But you know what that's like for the kids?  Yeah.  Hey, mommy.  Four million bucks.  That's how much you were worth to her.  Four mil, and she, you know, gives you up.  She never wanted the kids.  I know.  But she made it sound like she did. 
[00:07:30]  She's a bizarre woman, too.  So she could get this payoff.  She saw money.  Yeah.  She knew there was some cash in a custody fight.  And I was reading more excerpts from that book that's coming out on Michael Jackson.  Yeah.  Halperin, who we've had on the show.  That was him, right?  Who did Tom Cruise's.  Yes.  And we've got to get him on again.  I'm sure he wants to sell some books.  I mean, the book will do well.  But we've got to get him on again.  He's pretty legit in that world.  Because that world's a little strange.  He's coming out and basically saying Michael Jackson was as gay as they come. 
[00:08:00]  Was a gay guy sneaking around, going to seedy hotels in Vegas for hookups because he had no money.  Was he ever in Gurney?  In Gurney.  In a limo in Gurney.  Dressed like a woman.  To sneak out of the house, he would sneak around to seedy hotels to meet lovers.  Do you know, we were talking about this guy yesterday.  And I'm like, is that the guy that did Tom Cruise's.  I'm almost positive, Jimmy.  I think you're right.  Because what he did was smart.  And again, maybe this is the way things really are.  But he comes out. 
[00:08:30]  He writes a tell-all book about Cruise.  And you're like, how does Scientology not just kill this guy?  He says Cruise isn't gay.  Which, again, maybe the truth.  But it's an inflammatory book.  But that's the most important message for them to get out there.  Michael Jackson is not being a pedophile.  Like, maybe he was gay and not a pedo.  Maybe that's the truth.  That's what the book is going to say.  We're going to leave him alone.  Because, all right, he got that message out.  Yeah, be gay.  It's not shocking.  Yeah.  So we'll leave him alone.  We won't sue him.  Right.  Yeah.  That's a good point. 
[00:09:00]  Good pert.  Because he's a legitimate biographer.  He's seen as a legitimate guy.  And, you know, that's the message that they want to get out there.  Well, Chris the Trucker knows how Michael Jackson died.  I bet he does.  Chris the Trucker.  Hey, how y'all guys doing?  Hey, buddy.  Hey.  Boo!  Boo!  Really?  Chris, I didn't hear you.  What?  I didn't hear you.  What?  He died of food poisoning.  Oh, really?  Why?  Oh, my God.  I didn't hear that. 
[00:09:30]  He ate a...  Boo!  Wait.  I didn't hear the punchline.  What?  Wait.  He died of food poisoning.  We got that out so far.  Yeah.  He ate a...  Boo!  He ate what?  Dude, I can't hear you.  Yeah, okay.  Boo.  Right.  With the fucking jokes.  We get it.  How many times I've heard the 10-year-old weenie joke? 
[00:10:00]  Shut up.  How many times have you had it texted to you and emailed and everything else?  Enough already.  We get it.  It's hysterical.  We're all social networking.  Yeah.  You don't think that one has come...  That was there like the first fucking...  Right when he died, you were getting those things on Twitter and texts.  They didn't even call his death yet and that joke was out there.  People are hysterical.  He's freaking me calling with that one.  Oh, that's wonderful.  Who's this?  Matt, what's going on? 
[00:10:30]  Hey, good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Matt.  Hey, Debbie Rose took that $4 million payoff, but the stipulation is that Joe Jackson has  to stay the fuck out of these kids' lives.  You can't go anywhere near them.  Is that true?  Oh, no way.  I heard that, too.  No, I'm not at most of them.  That's what it came over to the news last night, man.  Well, you really think Joe Jackson has it in him to really smack around more kids or  whatever the fuck he was doing to Michael Jackson?  He'll exploit them.  Maybe that's what she's worried about.  Maybe she thinks he'll exploit them.  Isn't he in his 80s?  I don't know.  I mean, how many more years left does he have?  I don't know. 
[00:11:00]  That's not bad, man.  Yeah, we're reading the article.  I don't see anything in there about it.  Yeah, I don't know if I believe you there, Rob.  Yeah, that seems like something that would really have to be.  I don't think she cares what happens to these kids.  Oh, stop it.  If something happens to Canada, I guess maybe it's a custody thing.  Yeah, there's nothing really in there that says anything about Joe. 
[00:11:30]  And why is everyone scared that Joe Jackson is going to make them into the Jackson 3 or whatever?  Don't they have to have talent to begin with?  It says, while it had been thought that Roe was demanding that Jacko's abusive father, Joe,  have nothing to do with the kids, the source said there is no such language in the agreement.  Still, the family will keep him in check, the source said.  So the caller's dumb, and I'm even dumber because I did hear that, and I agree with the caller  like the two of us have come to that conclusion.  So I'm a fool for agreeing with the caller.  Joe Jackson is reportedly pushing his dead son's children, including Prince Michael II, 
[00:12:00]  a.k.a. Blanket.  Blanket hates the light.  Blanket, to form a new group, the Jackson 3.  That's such a dumb rule.  I know.  I know.  Well, they're posting it in here in the post.  They should call it the Jacksons and show up on time.  But that's something the family would absolutely not tolerate, the source said. 
[00:12:30]  They're not going to, they're not turning them into the Jackson 3.  That is the dumbest rumor ever.  Of course it is.  Incidentally.  Blanket is scared of his own shadow.  How are you going to get him on stage?  Is there a spotlight hitting that poor kid?  He'd shit his pants and run off stage.  I can't get enough of Blanket hating the light.  Little Blanket needs darkness.  He's scared shitless.  Blanket doesn't want to be on stage with spotlights.  Are you kidding me?  How are you going to transport him from city to city without him walking into the light? 
[00:13:00]  A little dark closet, a little portable closet.  Put him in there, he's all friendly.  He has to sit with the dark with the clothes and the little walls.  He's so scared.  Look, he's barely peering out between the two.  Look at him.  He's barely peering out.  Harry, what's he doing?  He's petrified.  Little Blanket's petrified.  I fucking just did it to myself.  Hiccups for the next 20 minutes.  Can I say I was wrong?  Wait, I got to go with Anthony's thing, though. 
[00:13:30]  Every picture you see of Blanket, he is petrified.  You only see one eye.  One eye.  He's just peeking out of somewhere.  Peering out.  Poor little bastard.  Fuck, I got hiccups.  How do you get rid of hiccups?  You have to spin in a circle and vomit.  God damn it, and I don't want that called.  There is one way to do it.  It sucks.  You got to drink a cup.  Of water with a napkin over it so you don't rip the napkin.  It's breathing control.  You have to breathe erratically through your nose while you swallow water. 
[00:14:00]  I didn't know I had to breathe in.  At an erratic pace.  You can't do it in a rhythmic thing.  You got to gulp, breathe in a little, gulp, breathe out a lot, breathe in a lot, breathe out a little.  Really mix up your breathing and your swallowing water.  And then the hiccups go away.  No shit.  Give it a try.  All right, I'll try it during the break.  Thank you.  Watch it induced stroke.  Jimmy, what were you saying?  Oh, no.  I just wanted to enjoy the blanket hits the light.  I had never seen that photo.  We're slowly developing. 
[00:14:30]  Just his little eye peeking out from between his brother and sister.  Google image blanket right now.  And watch how many pictures.  It's just blankets.  Danny, you stink.  Look.  He's wearing a mask.  There's one picture of Blanky.  He's wearing kind of like a Robin mask.  A little Blanky with a mask on.  Every picture he's hiding.  Look.  A little blanket with a hood pulled all the way over his head.  With his long little tussleable hair.  I think Blanket's my new hero. 
[00:15:00]  A little blanket.  Every fucking picture of Blanket.  Poor little Blanket.  The other two, not so much.  Look at his hat's pulled down all the way over his face.  The other kids are wearing caps.  Yeah.  And they're just wearing them.  And Blanket's is pulled down all the way down to his nose.  Oh, my God.  Blanket hates the light rules.  He can't stand the light.  The poor little feller.  Even the one Michael Jackson pulled him over the thingy head.  His head was covered.  His head was covered.  Yeah, he's had a little blanket over his head. 
[00:15:30]  He is the product of his father.  Oh, yeah.  He's a definite product of his dad.  I have a feeling he might even be related to his dad.  There seems to be a little resemblance there.  I don't think there's anything going on with Michael Jackson's fucking DNA in any of those kids.  No.  There he is peeking out from on the cardboard.  What are you doing?  He's so scared.  He's like a shaking little chihuahua.  Why does it make us laugh uncontrollably that he's so scared?  Look at this one.  You're absolutely right.  Why is that funny? 
[00:16:00]  I don't know why it's funny.  It just is.  Sometimes something is just funny.  Blanket hates the light.  I guess we could keep Google bombing that.  You should know how to keep that kid in the dark.  He's just a boy.  He lives in his own darkness.  He lives in his own darkness.  That's an awful big place for a boy.  So, next week, Michael Jackson info.  And there's going to be no surprises there.  You don't think so, huh? 
[00:16:30]  I don't think it's going to be natural causes.  Oops.  The biographer, by the way, is not the same guy.  Ian Halpern is not the same guy.  The author is Andrew Morton, who did Cruz's book.  Morton.  How do I know Halpern?  I've heard the name, too.  He must have wrote.  He did two Kurt Cobain books.  Duh.  That's why.  Which ones?  Because there's a million of them now.  I'll get it for you.  A million of them.  There really is, though.  Oh, the other thing that we've got to turn the listeners on to is that pitch. 
[00:17:00]  Most of them have probably seen it because they're pretty savvy.  Yeah.  But what was it?  The mayor of Cincinnati had to throw out the first pitch?  Yep.  A black dude, by the way.  Yeah.  Which makes it more embarrassing as far as a...  I can talk from my own life.  I never met a black guy that wasn't good at sports.  At some...  Yeah.  In some capacity.  In my dumb world, that's what I know.  You're stereotyping.  Well, they don't mind that stereotype, right?  No.  That's a good one, you know.  Are we allowed to still positive stereotype? 
[00:17:30]  No.  Uh, mayor throws terrible first pitch is the search.  It's just amazing.  It's fantastic.  He couldn't fuck it up more if he threw it behind him.  You couldn't duplicate what he did.  Dude, and the thing that's my favorite is after he throws the worst pitch, he walks off  the mound and he does that thing that you'll do where you take your arm and you kind of  mock throw a pitch like, yeah, my muscle was a little tight.  Instead of just losing it up now, though. 
[00:18:00]  He, well, we haven't even explained it yet.  It went, it went completely left.  Yeah.  Like if home plate was, uh, it was, uh, um, how do we, how do we explain this?  If it was north home plate, he threw it almost west.  Yeah.  It's as if...  Yeah, there you go.  That's a good way to look at it.  He threw it to 10 o'clock.  Like home plate is...  10 o'clock?  You're giving him too much credit.  I'd say 9.05.  Right.  Right.  This guy was absolutely trying to pick someone off.  That's what it looked like. 
[00:18:30]  It's like, come on.  What the fuck?  Oh, it was great.  He stunk.  And he didn't even play, like, sometimes you got to look at the crowd and then just kind  of like, ugh, and let the crowd laugh at you and it happened.  You don't try to act like, ah, I'm an athlete, but I just kind of threw my shoulder out.  Yeah, he should have pretty much ducked down to his knees and just kind of shook his head  and, oh, yeah, I acknowledge.  I fucked that one up.  Wow.  But he does this arm move where it's just, yeah, yeah, I think I got it now.  Give me the second chance. 
[00:19:00]  Not only did he throw it completely left, he threw it short, too.  Oh, it was short.  He didn't even have enough fucking distance on the thing.  He looks like Lugas, and he does that thing where he itches under his nose after.  He was humiliated by this.  Yeah, yeah.  You can just watch it over and over.  Kevin from Connecticut, Governor Patterson could get closer to the White House.  Fuck.  He is being laughed at by everybody.  And we're stupid, because Aaron in Cincinnati writes, that happened like two years ago. 
[00:19:30]  Did it really?  What do you want from us?  We didn't know that.  It's new to us.  That's an old one?  Really?  To me, it happened yesterday, because I just saw it today.  It happened just this morning.  Right.  Jared, Boston.  Hey, boys.  How you doing?  How's the socks doing?  Not too bad.  Not too bad.  Yeah.  You know, Jimmy's got the worst little farts, but you think Little Blanket has the worst little  sour stuff, nervous farts on the planet?  Oh, how nervous is that little feller?  Oh, that house has got a stink. 
[00:20:00]  Just constantly letting the frightenedness out of him.  Oh, time for dinner.  Blanket!  He just peeks out with one eye, looking.  Making little poops.  Little nervous farts.  Oh, no.  Blanket's having milk, and we have to leave the house.  It's going to be an ugly day.  More shots of him.  One eye.  Yeah.  Because he has his hair down over his face to begin with.  And then he's, like, peeking out from somebody. 
[00:20:30]  Petrified.  Poor little guy.  Love and Death, the murder of Kurt Cobain, and who killed Kurt Cobain?  The mysterious deathman icon.  You think he was murdered?  No.  I think he shoved a shotgun into his face and pulled the trigger.  He was miserable.  He was depressed.  Simple Mike in the house.  That's it.  Oh, there he is.  Simple Mike.  How you doing?  What are you doing?  I'll remember Simple Mike.  I'm taking breakfast orders for Danny at the moment.  Yeah.  Very exciting. 
[00:21:00]  What, do you get his breakfast every morning?  Every morning, yeah.  Whatever he wants.  Adam and Eve on a raft.  Wreck him.  What is Danny having today?  Is it?  Yeah.  Adam and Eve on a raft.  Wreck him.  What's that mean?  Two eggs on toast.  Broken yolk.  Wow.  I never heard that.  I don't know.  It comes from an old I Love Lucy episode.  Adam and Eve on a raft.  Adam and Eve on a raft.  Wreck him.  Who would...  You should go in and order that.  Hey, Rick.  That's fucked up.  Yeah.  Look at that picture. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, my God.  What's on his face?  It's like a burka.  It's a burka.  I think he has some kind of burka on his face.  It's wearing a burka.  And pajama pants.  That's great.  And you wonder why the kid hates the light.  Jesus.  Make him comfy like he's going to bed all the time.  That's great.  Like he's going to bed.  Exactly.  Look at him.  It's bedtime all the time for a little blanket.  Fucking obsessed with blanket.  Hating the light.  What does Danny have in there, Simple Mike?  I don't know.  I'm waiting here.  All right.  I know it'll have turkey Swiss on a wrap. 
[00:22:00]  Everything's so delicious.  From this place?  That's lunch.  I don't know how he does it.  Our hours do like lunch hours.  I know.  I know.  Lunch for us is about 10, not 6.30.  I usually at 8 o'clock have, you know, some kind of turkey sandwich.  It's stupid.  Stupid fucking lifestyle.  Let's say hi to Andy in Georgia.  Andy.  Yeah.  How long do you think it's going to be before they have that little fucker blanket on South  Park?  Oh, I'm sure they'll do some kind of blanket.  Didn't they have him on there already?  Yeah.  They had some kind of a Michael Jackson episode. 
[00:22:30]  No, that's just butters.  And blanket was a little butters.  That's not blanket.  That's butters.  I don't know.  I'm pretty scared of my life.  Right.  I don't know.  Yeah, they did do something with blanket, though.  They did a whole episode about Michael Jackson and and him, you know, touching kids.  Yeah.  Him and Cartman becoming very close.  And and blanket was it.  Blanket was probably the funniest part of that entire episode.  Yeah. 
[00:23:00]  What name do they use for Michael Jackson?  Do you remember Michael Jackson?  Oh, yeah.  They don't give a shit.  So they usually change the name a little or no.  So Michael Jackson is pretty hot right now.  Can we get a couple of clips from that episode for everybody?  We can have fun with that today.  Michael Jackson is very cold right now, though.  Oh, well, I see.  He was good point.  But if he gets cremated, then I'll be right.  Oh, for a few.  Right.  For a few hot minutes.  And then you can kiss his ass.  Kiss your ass.  Goodbye.  Oh, let me tell you. 
[00:23:30]  This is a fun morning.  Speaking of child molestation, Joan Rivers.  We were just talking about her yesterday.  How could she be tied into any child molestation?  Remember we were talking about how edgy she is?  Yes, we were.  Blah, blah, blah.  Love her.  And then Rich Voss had to say that she wasn't.  What did he say?  I don't know.  You explained Joan Rivers perfectly, and then he had to say something.  Rich, I couldn't get past his faux pas yesterday.  It was faux pas. 
[00:24:00]  He had some good ones.  Oh, my God.  Did he have some good ones?  Did we write them down?  I hope so.  Danny, we write the new faux pas down?  We have them.  I'll take a look.  What was the big one?  There was a big one.  There was a big one.  Well, yeah.  There was one.  One was Joval.  Joval.  Joval was good.  And Cellulite.  And then Celluloid.  Cellulite.  You fool.  That's what I do when there's a blackout.  Make money.  I Cellulite.  What a dolt. 
[00:24:30]  Let's go to Philly.  We're going to be there for UFC, my friend.  What's up, Brian?  Yeah.  Hey, good morning, boys.  Hey.  Hey, good morning.  Yeah, that South Park episode you're talking about, they didn't really use his name as Michael Jackson.  He's kind of hiding incognito in South Park, and he was going by the name of Mr. Jefferson.  I think I do remember that.  Mr. Jefferson?  Yeah, I don't remember if I saw this one.  Oh, yeah, I saw this one.  Yeah, let's get some clips from this.  Thanks, Brian.  So Joan Rivers had a little po-fah. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, no.  Not really.  Some were saying.  So anything you want to talk about in the current news?  I just...  The door's open.  Someone told me that Michael Jackson died.  Is that true?  Yes, unfortunately, it is.  Yeah.  Well, that's good.  I can let my grandson take a walk alone again.  Good for her.  Good.  I couldn't hear it.  She said that I can let my grandson take a walk alone again.  She's implying that he was a pedophile and dangerous. 
[00:25:30]  Good for Joan.  Implying that he might have molested her young grandson.  And the fucking dummies who were asked her the question go, oh, like you couldn't believe  she just said that.  Well, that's what they were hoping she would say, something crazy, right?  Yeah, she made shocking.  They're calling it a shocking child molestation joke about Michael Jackson.  Stop.  To the paparazzi.  The shocking part is the child molestation.  Right.  Not the jokes about it.  Oh, the other one was Marty Grass.  Marty Grass.  He's done that one before, though.  Yeah.  That's an oldie. 
[00:26:00]  Gets that one wrong all the time.  Every time he has to play that club, I think it's in Arizona.  All right.  Oh, I'm just watching Michael Jackson.  Yeah, we're going to get some clips.  And Little Blanket.  Is Little Blanket wearing a mask?  Do they have Blanket in this episode?  Yeah, yeah.  He's on a little choo-choo train.  Blanket's the best.  Can you give me another picture of Blanket when you have time?  Yeah, Little Blanket.  Just a good, solid picture of Blanket being scared of the light. 
[00:26:30]  Remember, Blanket hates the light.  It certainly does.  Home Run Derby.  I'll go to Travis on this one.  Travis?  That was one of the most boring ones in recent memory.  Why?  It dragged on for a long time.  The first round dragged on for a while.  The first two guys, you know, I think it was Prince Fielder and Nelson Cruz.  They both hit like 11.  It was really nice.  And then there was 0, 2, 5. 
[00:27:00]  It was just boring.  And a lot of people were just taking their time, picking their pitches.  I mean, when it's supposed to go from 8 to 10, and the first round's not even over by 10,  how can you just keep watching?  It's so boring.  You know what they should do is they should get a pitching machine.  Instead of having a pitcher throw it in?  Yeah.  And then they go, how many strikes in the first round?  Well, you have 10 outs.  Oh, 10 outs.  That's right.  I'm sorry.  I do not.  So, all right. 
[00:27:30]  The pitching machine, if you let one go by, guess what?  That's an out.  I agree.  I think you should get 10 pitches.  But have a pitching machine so every pitch is exactly the same for every player.  Well, everybody likes to bring their own person to pitch.  Yeah.  Oh, they do?  Yeah, you can pick whoever you want.  Huh.  Jimmy, why haven't you been picked?  I don't know.  I think the mayor of Cincinnati keeps taking my gig.  Someone should pick the mayor of Cincinnati.  They're still in the first round at 7 in the morning. 
[00:28:00]  Will you just throw one over the plate?  Jesus.  Now that his arm's all limbered up.  Yeah.  Dope.  Any guys just smashing those things over there?  Oh, sure.  Yeah.  Prince Fielder, who won.  He's an animal.  Yeah, he really is.  He's just like his father.  Cecil?  Yeah.  Anyone?  But they don't get along, right?  I don't think so, no.  Cecil's in a lot of financial trouble, I think.  Is he really?  Big Daddy?  Yeah, I think he lost all his money.  Big Daddy ruled.  Ouch.  Big Detroit Tiger for many years. 
[00:28:30]  And Prince doesn't get along with the guy that gave him all that nice DNA?  Or allowing him to be a Major League Baseball player?  I never understood that.  I mean, not get along with that, right?  You should, like, you know, make good with your dad if he makes you an all-star baseball player.  Yeah.  Yeah, he hit a few that were, like, I think he had one that was close to 500 feet.  Yeah, he is a monster.  That's the one they're showing on the news all morning long.  Is he big like his dad?  He's built exactly, he's a little smaller than him.  I would say he's exactly, he looks like he's in better shape than his dad. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, he's probably more athletic.  Like, Cecil was pretty, just fat.  They're both big boys, but Prince has a little muscle to him, or muscle tone, whatever you want to call it.  He's ripped.  I think that's...  Compared to his father.  I think that's pretty funny, that little screen that the pitcher hides behind during these...  You want to get one, you know, hit right back at you?  No, but it happens in the real game.  Yeah, but these guys are just trying to have a little fun.  They're not trying to win a playoff spot.  You don't want to crack your fucking skull open while you're just having some fun.  You know how good of a pitcher you have to be, though, to throw a pretty good strike over a fucking cage? 
[00:29:30]  I know.  Well, it's actually...  Yeah, the mayor of Cincinnati, it would have hit the cage, bounced back, and hit him in the face.  I think...  You know how much easier it is to throw a strike with that in front of you?  Oh, plus they're near the mound.  They're closer.  Yeah.  Yeah, they want to make sure they get these guys some nice balls to hit.  And that was it, huh, Travis?  Yeah, that was pretty much it in the All-Star Games tonight, so...  I haven't watched an All-Star Game in...  It's so good.  I can't even tell you how many years. 
[00:30:00]  All I ever know is...  Who gives a shit?  Jeter's in it again.  Yeah.  Obama's going to be in the...  There, I think he's throwing out the first pitch, and he's going to be in the broadcast  booth at one point with Joe Buck and McCarver.  Really?  Yep.  For, like, for an inning.  But I think that's...  He's a smart guy because he does the Tonight Show.  He's doing this.  It's, like, all this pop culture shit where people are actually looking and listening.  Right.  He's showing up.  He's smart.  Clinton sort of started that.  Yeah.  Even though, like, Nixon did a thing or two.  Hey, sock it to me, Jew. 
[00:30:30]  I remember laughing.  But Obama's all in.  He's got the Twitter.  He's doing...  What is he doing on YouTube?  He does, like, a podcast.  Does he?  He's doing YouTube things.  He does pranks.  Right.  He does, like, jackass stunts.  Yeah.  You see the one where he rides the pickup truck and then jumps off and it hits the pole?  He, uh...  What does he do on YouTube?  He does a weekly, uh...  Like, in a weekly...  Webcast, kind of like, you know, all the presidents do weekly radio.  Hoo-hoo.  Ripped me off. 
[00:31:00]  That's not bad, though.  That's, uh...  And he's using Twitter and whatnot.  He's all in as far as all this pop culture stuff goes.  He's getting in there.  Dude.  Dude, speaking of YouTube, you guys have seen the Fred videos by now, right?  Uh-uh.  Travis, definitely.  I guarantee he has.  He looks...  Travis has a stupid look on his face.  I don't think I have.  Fred videos.  I didn't know what the Fred videos were until my, uh...  My nephew, JD, you know, came over.  Mm-hmm.  And he was showing me what he really likes on YouTube. 
[00:31:30]  Man, you sit a kid down and go, show me what you like on YouTube.  It is bizarre.  Really?  It is so different than...  Not like sitting us down and going, what do you like?  Yeah, but...  All right.  Yeah, but I mean, going with the obvious, like, yeah, we'd go with porn or whatever, but I  mean, just basic shit that a little kid is into, you can't even, you can't even relate.  Really?  Have you seen these Fred videos?  They get, like...  This thing has 29 million views.  Yes!  What?  I saw one of these a few weeks ago, because it was popping up in a few of my spots, and 
[00:32:00]  I was like, all right, well, now I have to watch it, because it's, you know, been handed  to me enough times.  I don't, I don't understand.  What is it?  The kids love it.  What does he do?  And now he makes appearances on Nickelodeon TV shows.  He's becoming a big star.  So he's clean?  Oh, way clean.  He's becoming a big star.  Go, uh, acting lessons, YouTube lessons.  Go to the main one, like, the most viewed Fred video, because I think that was the one  I was, I was watching. 
[00:32:30]  Fred.  It's just Fred.  Is this the one that has...  Well, let me see.  I'll go to the one that has the most hits.  I think the one, I saw the one where he works out.  Jesus.  He wears a shirt called Fred.  What?  Basically, he just speeds his voice up.  Oh, he speeds his voice up?  Yeah.  What's funny about that?  Well, what's...  Fred goes...  Oh, Jesus.  Fred loses his mind.  21 million hits.  All right.  Yeah, I go with that one, I guess. 
[00:33:00]  21 million.  This is what...  And now 21 million and one, thanks to you, Dan.  Hey, it's Fred.  What's up, homie G?  I'm sick of my friends.  I'm sorry.  I'm in the chain.  I should eat the goofball.  Watch a boy do his thing.  I should say.  Watch how I do this.  Watch how I do this.  Dan, get down with your gangster sale.  If you're wondering why I'm acting rather extraordinary right now, it's because I haven't  taken my pill.  Don't tell my mom that I've lost my pills.  Okay, well, here's what I'm talking about.  I have a condition where I need to take pills to activate like a normal human. 
[00:33:30]  I mean, even my teacher noticed I was acting weird.  Earlier today, I drew a picture of a guy hurting a little kid.  And my teacher was like, that's not appropriate for school.  And I was just like, you got to accept it.  It happened.  People get hurt.  People hurt when we're in this world.  So yeah, I really don't think she got what I was trying to express through my picture.  All right, we get it.  He talks fast enough.  The guy who I took the Fred channel from on YouTube emailed me.  He told me I better watch my back.  I'm scared.  I'm going outside during a thunderstorm morning.  It looks as if a tornado's forming. 
[00:34:00]  I need medication, I need medication, I need medication, I need medication.  I'm going to ding-dong ditch Kevin's house.  Take that, Kevin.  That's what you get for the one to make that to get at me, you jerk.  I can't believe I'm outside right now.  The radio said everyone has to be indoors, no way from windows.  I heard once that if you get struck by lightning, you get secret powers.  If I get struck by lightning, maybe I turn into a merman.  I need some medication.  My brain is going crazy.  I'm going to go insane if I don't get my mail.  I need my medication.  If I don't take my meds soon, someone's going to put me in a straitjacket. 
[00:34:30]  My mom said she got put into a straitjacket once.  She was tied to a bed in a straitjacket.  She told me it wasn't a good experience.  Oh my God, I better find my meds.  Or else I'll be in a straitjacket.  Holy crap, look at that cloud right there.  I think it's starting to spin.  A twister's going to come out.  I'm going inside.  I think because I've been taking the meds so long, I'm addicted to them.  I'm craving them.  My things need meds.  I will say I like this more than I thought I would.  At least he produced it.  That's going to be me if I don't get any meds.  Where could they be?  They're not under my bed sheets either. 
[00:35:00]  I need them.  I need them.  I want meds.  I want to behave like a normal kid.  Fred, here's your pills.  Sorry, I had them with me all day.  I confused them with my medication.  Sorry, Fred.  Yay!  After I take this, I'll be a normal kid again.  That just hit the spot. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, I'm a normal kid now.  I'm a normal kid.  I behave like a normal child now.  Okay, well, I found my meds.  I'm all better.  Bye!  I'll show you how to do this, son.  See, I've become...  Yeah, I thought it was going to be worse.  There are parts that do make you laugh.  There's a couple parts that didn't make me laugh.  I got to be honest.  If we're going to be honest, man.  He's running down the street afraid of the tornado.  That was kind of funny.  At least he did produce it and he's running.  It's not just someone talking to a camera.  This kid put effort into it. 
[00:36:00]  Do the one where he works out.  Christ, that many fucking hits?  Yeah.  All right, that's a little carried away.  Every kid under the age of, I don't know, whatever you want to call it, 12, 13, are watching these videos.  This kid is red hot on YouTube.  Fucking red hot.  Is there a workout video?  He's got...  Fred works out.  Try that one.  The top...  Top second one in.  Now it'll get annoying. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, your breast smells like you just ate a dead animal carcass.  Hey, it's Fred!  And today I'm feeling very, very, very energetic, so I'm going to work out hardcore.  Okay, so I was asking my mom about my dad a few days ago, and she said that he was very muscular, so now I'm going to work out so intensely, so I'll be muscular too.  My plan is to work out like once every three months, or once every six months, whatever works with my schedule.  And then after a while, my muscles will just build up.  I'm really, really, really, really, really super excited to start working out, because then I'm going to be super strong, just like my mom.  I mean, no offense to my mom or anything, but she is very muscular, but she's also pretty fat, so they kind of cancel out one another, so it really doesn't count. 
[00:37:00]  But she is my mother, so I don't even care if she has curves of steel or curves of fat.  That's it.  Okay, so let's start working out hardcore.  Oh, yeah, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da!  Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.  My mom specifically made these just for me.  Oh, yeah, so downright.  Thanks, sir.  Okay, well, to start out my hardcore workout, I'm going to lift some of my mom's weights.  Here it goes.  You just imagine what it would have been like if that weight would have fell straight on my neck, I would have died for sure. 
[00:37:30]  Okay, well, now it's time to work out my lower body on my mom's bicycle.  Okay, ready, set, go.  Imagine you're running away from Kevin.  Oh, my gosh, I'm so tired.  Just good thing I have this sweatband to soak up all of my sweat, or else I'd just be drenched by now.  Just drenched.  I think he's gay.  You know what, I'd like to see Kevin work on.  I'd like to see him lift up weights and ride bikes hardcore.  I'd also like to see Kevin sweat blood. 
[00:38:00]  Okay, well, now it's time to run and work out my leg muscles hardcore.  Ready, set, go.  Oh, jeez.  Does he do all these himself?  He's holding the camera himself.  Yeah, he's holding the camera.  Oh, that hits the spot.  I don't think I've ever worked this hard in my life.  It's just downright thick.  It's downright torture.  To all you people who exercise daily, you guys are messed up.  Something's wrong with your friend.  This is his real voice and he's just talking.  You know what, I feel like part of my soul was ripped out while I was working out.  It just took away part of me.  I seriously think I might be dehydrated. 
[00:38:30]  That just made it so much better.  Oh, my gosh, that water gave me so much strength.  How careful.  I landed on my foot.  I think my freaking foot is broken.  Ow, ow, ow, it hurts.  Like I said before, you people who work out are so, so, so messed up in your head.  Okay, so maybe my dad can take this torture, but I can't.  Okay, whatever.  When I'm older, maybe I can just take steroids like my mom did when she was in the Women's  Body Dollar Association.  I tried to be strong like my dad, but it didn't work out so well. 
[00:39:00]  Okay, well, I think I have to go because my mom just made some delicious buttered mushrooms.  Because I'm going to go eat them up right now.  Peace out, home dog.  Yeah.  Something tells me that if a girl walked through here, she would just boo until she left.  Might be fun to watch, but brutal to listen to.  Not brutal to watch, too.  Yeah, I know.  It was pretty brutal to watch.  Don't worry about it.  I'm sorry, Bob.  What can I tell you?  380 million total views.  On the Fred videos? 
[00:39:30]  380 million.  But you know how kids are?  It's probably 11 people.  Those dummies, they'll show their friends, watch this!  Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.  Now I'm going to steal it.  That is astounding.  A lot of hits for shit.  Let me say hi to Josh in New Hampshire.  Josh.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  All right, man.  Hey, my love of the show is the only reason why I kept my phone to the ear during that bullshit.  My fucking kids had me watch it on YouTube, and I came milliseconds from putting my boot 
[00:40:00]  through the fucking screen.  I can see why.  Look, if I was 10 years old, or 12 or 14, I would probably fucking howl at that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  There were a few points where it was kind of funny.  Yeah, yeah.  When he screams.  I need a fucking aspirin right now.  Lots of way.  Thank you.  Foamy the Squirrel is a million times funnier.  That's Garrett in Detroit.  Well, good for him.  I don't even know what Foamy the Squirrel is.  Do you know what Foamy the Squirrel is? 
[00:40:30]  I have no idea.  I do.  Let's see.  Let's go to Rob on Long Island.  Rob.  Yeah.  The reason why it's so popular is because about six months ago, Fred was on an episode  of iCarly, which is a Nickelodeon show, and it ends up that iCarly is one of the most  popular shows on cable.  Wow.  It gets four million a week.  Four million people watch iCarly.  Well, but Fred Video's got close to 30 million.  That one we saw had almost 30 million views.  That's kids. 
[00:41:00]  That's kids for you, right?  That's the kids.  That's it.  The kids.  The kids.  All right.  Tom and where are you?  Michigan.  Tom.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, buddy.  I work midnight.  Six o'clock in the morning is the highlight of my day.  Yeah.  And I have to listen to this.  Yeah.  Four days ago, I heard about some guy wanting to go pussy diving at the Queen's Motor Inn,  and please, please end it.  All right.  I think we...  Oh, yeah.  We're not going to be playing that again. 
[00:41:30]  I mean, you know.  No, no.  Just please end the front audio.  It's annoying.  That's what I mean.  We're not going to play that again.  It's done.  Which made my point.  Yes.  Because my nephew showed me that, and I'm like, well, okay, that part was kind of funny,  him screaming, but he was all about it, saying that this is what the kids are watching in  school.  Oh, okay.  Well, thanks.  That's what the white kids are watching.  We all are.  Yeah.  I don't think a lot of black kids are enjoying the Fred video.  Watching the fight videos. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  They're watching bum fights.  Bum fights and schoolyard fights.  I have to upload a video that I took last night.  Something good?  Well, I was extremely annoyed at my piece of shit Toshiba laptop.  Oh, what did I have?  Ugh.  Yeah, it's Windows, Vista, Toshiba piece of shit.  Ow!  Ow!  Gee!  It lasted about six months, I guess. 
[00:42:30]  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  And then became just a fucking, it became just a virus machine.  I don't know what the fuck happened, but nothing worked on it.  It was freezing up all the time.  So I got so angry, I punched the monitor, the screen.  That wasn't videotaped, but then it made that cracked-like thing and turned all wacky colors.  So then I did pull out my flip cam and decided to see what would happen if I threw it in the pool. 
[00:43:00]  Oh, wow.  So I took my laptop and threw it in the pool.  So it doesn't work anymore.  It just kind of sinks and then goes dim.  Oh, you see, it just goes dim?  It just goes dim and sinks to the bottom and the end.  It's not very exciting.  No, it isn't the end.  No.  We learned in AI that it'll just stay there alive for millions and millions and millions of years.  And it'll freeze. 
[00:43:30]  And the aliens will find it.  Just staring out into the cold water.  Oof.  Creepiest scene in movie history ever.  A little odd.  He's just fucking sitting there.  Yeah, it just kind of wants.  Who directed that?  That was Kubrick?  Kubrick and Spielberg were involved together, I think.  Yeah, yeah.  And they just want to remind us all that, you know, after our lives are done, you know,  enough time will go by and no one will even remember that we were ever here.  A million years.  Yeah, thank you, Mr. Spielberg.  That's what I want from my move me.  Move me.  Move me.  Movie. 
[00:44:00]  My move me.  My movie experience.  You ever watch After Man?  What the fuck is that?  After Man.  Life After Humans.  Life After Humans.  Yeah.  No, all those shows creep me out.  Yeah.  They show you like, you know, 100 years.  I already know all that stuff.  50 years after.  But I don't want to be reminded of it.  Weeds would grow in the street and you're like, ooh, Life After People.  Or Earth After People.  Whatever the fuck it is.  Yeah, it's Life After People.  What happened?  Like, how long until the buildings were covered up? 
[00:44:30]  I mean, obviously you get buildings like 80 stories tall.  That's a long time.  It shows you like, it's based on different areas.  You know, down in Florida, you'll get the fucking swamp and jungle will encroach on everything really quickly.  And then you get something in the Northeast, you're going to need a little more time for big trees to start growing through things.  But for the most part, it don't take long for nature to cover up this bullshit we built.  You know, I drive back and forth to Philly a lot for the last four or five years now. 
[00:45:00]  And there was a rest area slash service area that they closed down maybe two years ago.  Yeah.  It is amazing how much growth has happened.  Yeah.  Because they haven't really done anything with the space.  But where you used to drive in is now pretty much all weeds in two and a half years.  Yeah.  All weeds.  You can almost not see the road anymore where you used to pull in.  And that's something, how fast that happens.  They're showing like what happens to cities. 
[00:45:30]  They use a lot of CGI, which is pretty cool.  So they kind of show what happens in every major city.  It's also interesting because the architecture for certain cities are different.  So, you know, certain cities will crumble way before other cities just because of the way that some of their major landmarks are built.  Why would they crumble?  Just from neglect?  Erosion.  Yeah.  Corrosion.  Weather.  They show the Eiffel Tower like lasted a long fucking time.  You ever walk around ruins? 
[00:46:00]  That's why they crumble.  They last.  Ruins last.  Enough time goes by and everything's going to crumble down to nothing.  Ruins are rocks.  But don't forget, there'll always be evidence of us here.  Because you go, dinosaurs were how many years ago?  And they do find them.  10, 20 years.  Oh, I thought it was longer.  They do find them sometimes very close to the surface.  Like, you know, 10 feet down, 5 feet down.  And that's X amount of a million years ago, the Jurassic era or whatever.  You know what it is, though?  It's bones.  Like, they'll find our bones and shit.  But, you know, things we leave behind as far as buildings go, what, maybe some foundations? 
[00:46:30]  Cement?  Say an 80 or 90-story building or 70-story buildings fall.  After 10,000 years.  Out of the last 15, 20 stories?  That's a long time to cover that much space up.  Yeah, but...  They show...  What is this after how long?  What does...  10,000 years.  Yeah, but does that...  All these buildings just kind of...  There goes the Empire State Building.  After 10,000 years?  Yeah, but does that make you feel good that there'll be evidence that we're here, even  though we're not here anymore?  Who cares?  Who cares if some dumb building's still standing thousands of years?  They also show what happens to your pets. 
[00:47:00]  They just become wild packs of dogs and animals.  That happens...  And then they all...  Wait, wait.  That happens already.  Yeah.  You know how many old people got pets that are dying, and what do you think happens to  those pets?  A young relative, you know, goes over to the house and just whistles a happy tune and opens  the back door and lets the pet out.  What do you think that pet is now?  A wild animal.  On his own.  How long until the Empire State Building and stuff like that collapsed?  Major structures.  25,000 years.  25,000 years. 
[00:47:30]  Really?  No.  Would it really stand that long?  It's got to be sooner than that.  It's got to be sooner than that.  I would say it would have to be...  I'd give it 200 years.  No way.  200 years.  Look at the pyramids.  They're still standing.  Yeah, but they're not based on a steel structure.  Once that steel starts rusting, it's over, Johnny.  The Empire State Building has a lot of brick.  A lot of windows, leakage, weather gets inside, you know?  I don't know.  Maybe longer. 
[00:48:00]  Because look at the Coliseum.  Maybe because it's a certain height.  Maybe the Empire State Building would be worse because there's so much weight.  And it's narrow compared to the Coliseum.  I don't know.  That is true.  200 years.  Are you shitting me?  200 years.  Oh, give yourself a bill!  I'm right on the fucking button there.  With no maintenance.  First one of the day.  Large structures.  This is after 200 years.  Large structures such as the Empire State Building, Sears Tower, Space Needle, and Eiffel Tower  would collapse due to corrosion, invasive plant life, and groundwater destabilizing their foundations.  Wow.  That's fucked up, man. 
[00:48:30]  Huh?  Not really.  Well, you know, the pyramids are there and shit, and there's ruins where you can go.  But think of how much shit was there that you don't see because it's totally gone.  You got to think the windows blew out at least a thousand years ago at the pyramids.  Yeah, the windows are gone.  You don't see them anymore.  The windows are gone.  I mean, think about it.  You see the pyramids, and then what?  Like, what do you think?  They just built the pyramids and said, okay, let's leave.  There was probably a whole bunch of stuff around there that's just gone.  Oh, really?  Like a roller coaster and stuff?  According to the show, 10,000 years after people, the pyramids will still remain. 
[00:49:00]  Wow.  Wow.  And also, the faces at Mount Rushmore will survive and probably for hundreds of thousands  of years.  Hundreds of thousands of years.  Yeah, because that was carved into rock.  It says, our bones, rubber, plastic, and styrofoam might be the last remnants of humanity.  Fucking McDonald's, goddamn McDonald's boxes and shit and water bottles.  Just blowing.  Just kind of.  Blowing along.  Long after.  We're all just fucking.  When everything gets.  Not even a thought of us left.  When everything gets quiet again, finally. 
[00:49:30]  And then there was one episode about, like, you'd still hear human voices after a while  because of parrots and birds that had learned to talk.  So they would be flying around.  So you'd, even though there's no people, you'd hear like, hello, hello, hello.  That would have to be after like a nuclear explosion or something.  Well, they never say how the people disappear.  Yeah, but how are the parrots going to survive more than a few years after humans?  Who knows? 
[00:50:00]  20 years, whatever.  They get out the house, motherfucker.  Parrots could live for a very long time.  Yeah.  Yeah, but every human has to die and then you got to hope a parrot's still around.  Well, they never say how the people leave.  They just said this is what life would be like if people just disappeared without the  damage of, like, a meteor or something like this.  People just gone.  And then they see what we left, how long it would take for it to, like, crumble.  Do you walk around the city and do, like, math problems?  No.  Well, they take a lot.  I've got an iPhone.  They take a lot for granted in this city. 
[00:50:30]  I always think, like, God forbid there's a real major disaster, way worse than 9-11,  right?  Yeah.  Could all the people fit on the streets of New York at the same time?  Oh, right, right.  Could they actually all leave?  I do, like, math equations like that.  I'm like, all right, all these tall, massive buildings all around you filled with people.  Now all those people have to leave.  It's not even a question.  Everyone has to get out immediately.  Yeah.  What would the streets look like?  Would there be enough room for all the people?  And I don't know the answer. 
[00:51:00]  I say yes.  I think so.  Look at Broadway, New Year's Eve, Times Square.  That's just a few blocks, and there's a million people.  All right.  Say it's like that for the entire island of Manhattan.  Well, there's only a nine.  Say there's maximum.  Was it nine million people in Manhattan?  I'm guessing.  Hey, that's...  See, Jimmy's figuring it out.  I like this.  That is pretty good.  I like this.  You could pretty easily do it.  You get a million people just in that area.  You spread them out all over Manhattan.  Yeah, I think you could do that.  Okay.  I say yes.  The rest stop is the what? 
[00:51:30]  Bob in PA.  Bob.  Yo, guys.  Hey, Bob.  All right, Bob.  On 295, that was the Hoo-Hoo rest stop.  That one you're talking about.  Oh, was it?  Well, this one...  Yeah, that was on the Hoo-Hoo.  What's her name?  What was the woman governor?  Christine Todd Whitman.  Yeah, right.  Christy Todd Whitman.  Why, is that rest area falling apart?  Yeah, that's the one.  Actually, the one I'm talking about is on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.  Okay.  No, no, no.  Oh, yeah, I got you there.  But the one on 295, that's growing over, too. 
[00:52:00]  Yeah, the guy hated that one.  The glory hole's much too high.  You had to stand on your tippy toes.  I agree.  I concur.  Well, the truckers know what I'm talking about.  You see these old rest areas or service areas that they closed down a while ago, and  it's pretty amazing how fast this stuff starts growing back.  Yeah, I know which one you're talking about, though.  Right over the Pennsylvania Turnpike right there.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  Yeah.  And there's one still on the other side of the road that's open, and it's amazing the  difference between the two.  A mere two years. 
[00:52:30]  The change is unbelievable.  All right, guys.  That was cool.  That was fun.  Hundreds of thousands of years, huh?  Of course.  Eventually, erosion would get them, I guess, right?  I mean, like you say, a billion years from now.  Oof.  Would there be any signs?  Even the dinosaurs are on a billion years old.  You would probably have to really do some, you know, archaeology to find trace of people  after a billion fucking years.  Jesus.  Before the only thing left was like a 7-Eleven somewhere in Ronkakama.  It was pristine.  Perfectly standing, windows there, everything. 
[00:53:00]  Candy so fresh you could eat it.  Magazines.  All right, I got...  Not current, though, by a billion years.  A billion years old, of course.  I got the trivia question going into...  I got the trivia question going into break, and you guys think about this, okay?  Oh, I like this.  And then we could debate if this would actually be true.  Let's debate and kiss.  What would be the last remnant of humans living?  On the whole Earth.  The last thing.  I say felt hats.  It's ridiculous. 
[00:53:30]  We've been going...  Broccoli spears.  We've been going a million years.  Let's just go a ridiculous amount of time.  What would be the last remnant of human beings?  That's how I'm going to phrase the question.  Last thing that would identify that we were even here.  Everything else is gone.  Yeah.  The second most thing is gone.  There's only one thing remaining that proves humans ever existed.  What would that be?  Think about it during the break.  And turn off your screens. 
[00:54:00]  I'm scared.  I don't want you getting any help today.  I won't blurt it out, but I do know the answer.  Oh, you know it.  For real?  Yep.  Look at that face.  Look at Jimmy's acting.  I love the acting, Jim.  There's no way to prove it.  Well, that's where we could debate.  Sure.  What would be the last thing remaining that proves that we existed?  That we ever lived?  Opie and Anthony, hit the break.  Oh, yeah.  Ozzy? 
[00:54:30]  Oh, yeah.  Ozzy lost his dog.  What?  Yeah, there's two Ozzy stories.  We both blurted out a different Ozzy story.  I didn't hear that he lost his dog.  There's two of them, yeah.  He's replacing Zach.  Why?  I think he's, he, Ozzy felt, I agree with that, actually.  He felt that Zach sounded a little too much, his stuff would sound a little too much like  Black Label Society.  And Zach's been with him for a long time.  Yeah.  I'd prefer to see somebody new in there.  And it's not to disrespect Zach.  He's a great guitarist.  Is Black Label Society doing okay? 
[00:55:00]  It's a band I don't really follow, but I see a lot of, like, leather jackets with that logo on it.  Yeah.  So he's looking to replace Zach with a newer sound.  And then his dog eaten by a coyote.  Really?  Yeah.  Which one?  Holy shit.  I don't know.  What do you mean?  Oh, he's got more than one?  Yeah, but there's a couple that are pretty well known from the show.  Yeah.  That's no big deal.  With shit on the floor and then a little one.  That's no big deal, then, if he's got a lot of dogs.  If you only have one dog and he's eaten by a coyote, that's a bummer.  I don't think he cares. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  You got a bunch of them.  So the question is, long after we're gone, human beings, we're talking, you can't even  comprehend how many years.  Yep.  What will be the last thing that remains that proves that we ever existed?  It's open for debate, I think, too.  Yeah, it certainly is.  I mean, you could start saying, we could go easy, the George Washington Bridge. 
[00:56:00]  All right, then another 10,000 years go by.  Now that's gone.  You know what I mean?  So you've got to really think about this one.  Mount Rushmore.  Is it Mount Rushmore?  Nope.  No.  No.  I think I got it.  I wrote one down, too.  I have four possibilities.  I didn't write one down because I don't have a pen.  Here's your pen.  Write it down so we know you're not cheating.  Thank you for the pen.  Someone wrote, cut diamonds. 
[00:56:30]  But how does that prove that humans existed?  Circumcision has nothing to do with it.  I liked your other line about cut diamonds you said during the break, though.  What did I say?  What?  They were being clenched in.  Yes, a bunch of cut diamonds, and you have to unwrap the Jewish hand from them.  A Jewish joke.  Nothing wrong with a Jewish joke.  Leftic humor.  So you want to just all turn them over?  I have four possibilities, so I have one of four. 
[00:57:00]  I can't pick one.  Oh, you have to pick one.  I can't.  I can write four things.  It's just one thing.  You must pick one thing.  It goes against the whole question.  My cuck?  Because I could come up with four things, and you've got to think, well, out of those four  things, which one...  It's got to be one thing.  Yeah, which one lasts longer?  So those four things are left.  Go another million years.  All right.  I will...  What's still going to be there?  Okay.  And you know what?  I agree with Greg on Long Island.  Well, let's take a few phone calls before we go with the answers in the studio. 
[00:57:30]  Greg on Long Island.  I agree with Greg.  Yes, Greg.  I have two, actually.  Okay.  How come he can do that, too?  I can't have four.  Can't have two.  I'm hoping it's my Demented World CD.  Oh, those things will absolutely...  That would be one of the four on my list.  Thank you, sir.  And the other would be Fudgy Wudgy Bars.  Fudgy Wudgy Bars.  That's cool.  That won't even last the afternoon.  Did you ever read the ingredients in that?  It's got to last forever.  Wah-nah-wah-wah-nah.  Wah-nah-wah.  Thank you, sir. 
[00:58:00]  Happy birthday, Opie.  Um, is it my birthday?  No, it's my birthday.  Wait, is it my birthday?  Oh, it's not my birthday.  Aw.  I had to think for a moment.  Well, the ironic part is it's 7-19 and July 19th is my birthday.  How crazy is that?  Not at all.  Well...  Who's going to believe you, though?  I know.  It's your birthday every day.  That's your birthday every day.  Five more days is your birthday again?  So basically...  Seems like it's only been a year.  Basically, July 19th is the only day that it's not your birthday.  Yeah.  It was my birthday.  All right. 
[00:58:30]  Let's go with the answers in studio.  Ready?  It was my birthday.  You want to go first, Dan?  Because they're all written down, so we can turn them over.  I'm turning it over.  All right.  The question, long after we're gone, what will be the last thing remaining that proves  that we ever existed?  Here it is.  Lunar junk.  Lunar junk.  I believe all of our crap that is on the moon will remain there in semi-pristine condition.  What?  I was thinking that very same thing, but then the question was, wasn't it really about 
[00:59:00]  Earth?  I thought it was just people.  At said Earth, and I said the question exactly the same without acknowledging every said  Earth.  I realized you said...  I knew you picked up on my tell.  You then said that humans never existed.  Right.  It wasn't on Earth.  I just reiterated the question I initially said.  I don't care where it is.  You could also say...  And with that, we got a match.  Match game.  I went with flag on the moon.  Oh, I thought you meant me on the moon. 
[00:59:30]  You both were wrong.  You left out...  You put in an extra letter.  Flag on the moon.  I had paper airplanes.  Ah!  That was my guess.  Paper airplanes.  I didn't even think of that.  My second answer was cotton candy.  Yeah.  Mine was hardened white duty.  And I also had pencil sharpeners and a John and Ponch chips action figures.  Those were the four.  Well, now I understand why you couldn't pick just one.  Yeah, that is hard to pick.  But no, I disagree with lunar stuff because it's only been there for 35 years. 
[01:00:00]  The moon takes a beating because of the lack of atmosphere.  Now, the lack of atmosphere is, you go, well, maybe it won't erode.  But look at how cratered up and destroyed the moon's surfaces because of the beating it takes because there's no atmosphere to stop incoming shit.  But that stuff will probably be gone in a couple hundred years, a thousand years.  I wouldn't think so.  Dust will blow over it.  How about, well, you know, the debris is still there, even if it gets...  In our, from 69.  I mean, what is it, 40 years? 
[01:00:30]  Things still there as shiny as hell.  40 years.  Yeah, sure.  But wait, all it takes is one thing to smash into it.  There's no atmosphere stopping that.  So all these things that have stopped from hitting things at the surface of the earth hit the moon.  So what's going to out-survive this stuff on the moon?  What about, like, the Voyager satellite that's been thrust out of our own solar system?  I actually wrote down Voyager, but the reason I don't know is because Voyager can easily be destroyed by just hitting a meteor.  Or it can be easily swallowed up by, you know, some type of a flame. 
[01:01:00]  That's an easy one.  Okay.  We should have stuck with just...  Kill joy.  We should have stuck with just Earth.  Earth?  Because that's where it works.  Well, those things aren't so dangerous.  Positions out there.  I don't think Voyager will be 100,000 years from now like Mount Rushmore.  You know where that would be going.  We all were thinking space, which was smart.  So are we supposed to go, like, pyramids?  Pyramids.  I don't know.  Goddamn fucking pyramids.  What would be the last thing that survives on Earth?  Cut diamonds might be it.  I mean, I don't know how long they last because they proved that there was a craftsmanship of some sort or not natural design. 
[01:01:30]  True.  Let me go with Phil in New Mexico.  New Mexico.  New Mexico.  We have to say it like Spanish.  New Mexico.  New Mexico.  Hey, guys.  Hey, I just want to say maybe Anthony's hair implants might last.  Not implants.  Follicles.  The implants will last a long time.  They're follicles.  All right, guys.  That's it?  Let's go to Jeff.  Jeff?  Hey, what's going on?  Hey.  Your theory about the moon stuff has got to be wrong because I think the moon gets impacted significantly every 20,000 to 50,000 years. 
[01:02:00]  That stuff will probably be gone.  I think Jimmy's right.  I think it's actually nuclear waste.  Or nuclear.  Nuclear.  I say nuclear, too.  Nuclear.  That's actually not a bad answer.  Wait, how do you say it?  Nuclear.  He says nuclear.  Oh, nuclear?  No.  Nuclear.  It's nuclear.  You said nuclear.  It's...  Dead, dead, dead.  Who gives a shit?  That's a bad answer, anyway.  People are already living in Nagasaki and Hiroshima. 
[01:02:30]  And we fucking nuked the shit out of those places.  Everyone's fine.  Yeah.  You say nuclear waste.  Absolutely.  Like spent fuel rods, things like that.  Yep.  I like it.  Melted down and melted down reactors.  I like it.  No.  Let me go with...  Let me blown over.  Let me go with Brian in Illinois.  Brian?  Good morning, boys.  Brian.  Hey, Brian.  Hands down, the thing that's going to outlast everybody is Christmas fruitcake. 
[01:03:00]  Oh, I guess.  Who doesn't enjoy a good Christmas fruitcake joke?  I don't.  You don't, Jimmy?  I despise them.  They remind me of having my hiney diddled by strange men.  That sounds funny.  Well, cut diamonds was a great...  Some listeners suggested that.  How long do they last?  Because the erosion will eventually knock the faces...  The fucking heads on the mountains will eventually...  They'll be knocked off by erosion.  Yeah.  They'll be smoothed over.  In a billion years, those things will be fucking toast. 
[01:03:30]  Well, I've heard that they're already having problems with cracking and then water gets  in there and freezes and they've had to...  They've had to put cables up to hold shit.  Sure.  So what are they talking about?  Yeah.  Goddamn stupid faces are going to fall off.  Yeah, they're going to fall off.  Right.  Thank you, sir.  I enjoyed the fruitcake joke.  I didn't.  I don't even know why we continue making those fucking things.  No one eats them.  I love fruitcake.  You actually eat fruitcake.  I mean, it's a nickname. 
[01:04:00]  Who the fuck eats fruitcakes?  But you see them every holiday.  Some dumb relative brings it over.  Yeah.  And then you look at that dumb relative and go, yeah, I know.  You don't like me.  Well, guess what?  I don't like you either.  Or your fruitcake.  You just sit down and have your plate of fucking turkey.  That green fucking...  And get the fuck out of my house.  That hard green thing in there that just tastes like shit.  Dude, I don't think I've ever bitten into a piece of fruitcake.  I'm sure I did once.  It's awful.  I tried to eat around.  I was starving once.  I tried to eat around all that crap that's inside and just get the cakey part. 
[01:04:30]  Yeah.  And even that sucked.  And it's just chock full of ick.  Anthony, a lot of people try to figure out what would be the last thing that remains  long past humans are gone.  And I'm sorry.  Howard Stern's ego is not the answer.  Oh, my goodness.  Fetal Scrapings Smith writes.  And he wrote that from a dumpster.  Oh, a dumpster.  Well.  No, that's not the answer.  I'm sorry.  How about this one?  Tom in Chicago.  Tom. 
[01:05:00]  Hey, I got two of them, guys.  Good morning.  White Sox or Cubs?  I'm afraid White Sox.  No, I think White Sox is the cooler team in Chicago, right?  Pretty much.  Pretty much.  That's what I think.  Although I'm a president now.  Is Ilo a cool dude?  I think so, yeah.  I just love it that I can't understand a word of what's his name, you know, the manager,  what's his name.  I can't.  When he's talking.  Oh, he.  Yeah, what the hell is his name, man? 
[01:05:30]  I can't remember what's wrong with me.  Ozzie Guillen.  Ozzie Guillen, right.  When he gets all pissed off, you can't understand a word he's saying.  You know, I think it's a defense.  It's a planned defense mechanism.  Could we get some Ozzie Guillen audio today for Tom in Chicago?  That would be nice.  But seriously, back to what will survive.  One, Artie Ling's liver.  And secondly, though, the serious answer, radio transmissions in space.  Radio transmissions in space.  Danny's shaking his head no. 
[01:06:00]  Why, Danny?  Is that an acceptable answer, Danny?  No, because radio and TV transmissions actually degrade over a couple of light years into static.  Yeah.  A couple of light years away from Earth, and you have no idea what's going on here.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's true.  Fiddlesticks.  But are we looking for, like, a couple of light years, though?  Are we looking for a physical item?  You know, we've got to adjust this question a little bit.  And are we looking for the last item remaining on Earth?  I think it's, yeah, yeah, anything that proves that we existed or anything on Earth that proves we existed. 
[01:06:30]  Well, we lived here.  I'm sticking with Artie's liver, though.  All right.  Thanks, Tom.  I'll punch you off.  All right, man.  It's such a tough, there's so many things, and then you think, and then you just think, well, all right, billion years, and it's gone.  Bones?  I mean, how long will bones last?  Because bones seem pretty sturdy.  Yeah, well, bones?  I mean, it's going to be one of the last things remaining. 
[01:07:00]  According to the show, Life After People, aside from bones and plastics and stuff like that,  one thing that they said would survive for quite some time is stuff made out of solid granite and concrete,  like the concrete pedestal of the Statue of Liberty.  I was going to say hell no with the concrete.  Oh, wow.  Most concrete sucks.  But why?  I mean, that's 10,000 years.  No, we're talking, say, 20 million.  But I mean, that's going to be, as far as they know, I mean, that's, and the stuff that will remain past that will probably be so buried,  you'd have to actually dig up a whole bunch of Earth to actually, to find it. 
[01:07:30]  Well, below the Earth, I bet you a lot of stuff remains, because once it's in the Earth, it might stay that way forever.  Well, let's adjust the question again.  Oh, my God.  You have to see it.  What's the last thing you see?  Oh, shit.  The last thing you actually see, like someone's walking around going,  Then that has to be something that's quite tall.  Yeah, it's a structure.  It's the top of a structure.  Or is it?  But what if the structure, you know, collapses before the big mudslides or whatever? 
[01:08:00]  I'm going to go with airplane.  Well, it's the highest thing.  It's not.  It won't be in the sky, Opie.  It won't fly.  Why not?  I don't know.  They're running out of fuel.  Flags at the top of Mount Everest.  Oh, fuck it.  Now you're fucking talking.  That's terrible.  Now you're fucking.  Snow will cover it.  No, it won't.  True.  We'll get blown off.  Have you ever been to the top of Mount Everest?  Tattered dragon.  I've done four trips up there.  I'm the Sherpa kid.  That's what they call Jimmy. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Who brought you?  Ted the Sherpa?  Yes.  This is as high as I go.  300 feet.  Oh, oxygen bottles on Everest.  That's a good one.  But Ted, we paid you to go all the way to the top.  Yes, but I'm tired.  I hate heights.  But it's in the brochure that you'll bring us to the top.  I didn't write the brochure.  That'd be my cousin, Ted the brochure maker.  He's very inaccurate.  Well, now what?  We traveled all this way to get to the top of the mountain.  Yes, have a good trip and talk to me all the way down.  I'll hold your hat. 
[01:09:00]  Ted the Sherpa sucks.  Ted the Sherpa runs out of steam relatively quickly, Gregory.  We get the point, though.  Porno CDs, styrofoam, dust can't blow over things.  It's on the moon because there is no atmosphere.  Jimmy is an idiot.  No, I'm not.  There is no atmosphere, but there is some kind of a – you do have space wind and stuff  like that, Rob.  Space wind?  Space wind?  What's space wind?  You have some kind of –  Yeah, Jimmy, where is there an atmosphere on the moon?  I know there's not an atmosphere on the moon. 
[01:09:30]  I love how he has the question laughing.  But there –  Jimmy.  Jimmy, you idiot.  But there is some kind of a – there's a very, very light atmosphere on the moon,  I think.  I don't know.  It does move a little bit.  It doesn't never move, dude.  There's gravity, but no atmosphere.  A little bit of gravity, no atmosphere.  None whatsoever?  None atmosphere.  There's a little bit of gravity.  And –  I don't believe that it can't –  It's very dusty.  I don't believe that dust can't – in 50,000 or 100,000 years blow over those things. 
[01:10:00]  If there's an impact of a meteor, then dust would kind of spread out because you get some  gravity, so it would get up into the surrounding area and then it's settled back down, I guess.  As far as impacts go, this is a very – this is a quiet stage of the solar system.  You know, when the Earth is like 4 point something billion years old, and like the first couple  billion years when it was developing, there was impacts all the time.  You know, that's why the moon looks like that. 
[01:10:30]  But there can be millions of years before there's like another impact that like is like perfectly  timed out to hit the moon, you know?  Well, plus how long –  I think those will be there for a long time.  Maybe they will do, but how long are they actually going to last just standing there?  You mean you talk about rust and corrosion.  Any kind of corrosion?  No, corrosion happens from atmosphere, from water, from –  What about stuff –  There's nothing.  What about stuff like – what about stuff like the radiation in space or any of the  elements in space?  Space is a fucking – a deadly, vicious place. 
[01:11:00]  It could be that, yeah, the sun, the sun itself could probably, if it's like, you know,  over millions of years, just like, you know, the rays or the ultraviolet that comes from  the sun could probably, you know, damage it.  But that's like –  I'm not even sure of that.  Millions and billions of years.  I don't know.  I wish – I would – I mean, what you're saying is interesting, but I want to hear somebody  else's opinion on that because I don't believe that there's no way dust – there is space  wind.  I know there's some kind of wind in space.  Solar – yeah, solar winds, they call it. 
[01:11:30]  Solar winds, I'm sorry.  Yeah, space –  Solar winds, yeah.  You missed Rob's comment.  Yeah, he's very funny.  I drive the truck.  I'm not a scientist.  I like that one.  I want to say –  Thank you, sir.  It's Devil's Tower.  Devil's Tower.  Where's that?  I'm saying Devil's Tower, Wyoming.  That sounds scary.  I have one.  You have one, Dan.  What about the Great Wall of China?  You know you can see it from space.  It'll last a long time.  One of – how many – the only man-made structure you can see from space?  No, that's a rumor.  No, also the one in Vegas. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, the Grand Canyon.  No, that's not man-made.  Oh, we didn't dig that out.  Someone dug that out, yes.  We didn't dig that out.  It's a foundation for a big building that they didn't build.  Oh, I was mistaken.  Devil's Tower wasn't man-made.  Hey, fucko.  How do you know the Devil's Tower wasn't made?  Look up the Devil's Tower monument, national monument.  It's too scary.  And you tell me that fucking Teddy Roosevelt had nothing to do with the Devil's Tower monument.  And if you're right, I won't bounce you. 
[01:12:30]  How about gold bars?  Well, gold is one of the softer metals, Greg.  And I don't know how long a soft metal lasts.  Diamonds last longer than gold?  I think they do.  Cut diamonds?  I think so, sure.  How the fuck is a gold bar going to start eroding?  You answer that question.  I don't know how gold is.  Maybe – will it break down or no?  We got a lot of great answers coming in.  Let's go to Mike in New York.  Mike?  Mike?  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[01:13:00]  Hi.  I don't think this is a man.  See, I wanted to say the World Trade Center site because it's still going to look the  same in a billion years.  Oh, wow.  That's the truth.  That's one for the New Yorkers.  I got to give it to you on that one.  Thank you, Mikey.  Matt?  Yeah, I learned from the great documentary, Planet of the Apes, the Statue of Liberty is  going to be the only thing left.  Good point.  It wasn't a great documentary.  Well, it could be.  Fucking Matt.  Funniest listeners in radio.  We got it.  Ah, the Statue of Liberty.  Damn you all to hell.  Dan? 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, I was wondering if Ant would like to know what Doc Brown thinks is the last thing  left on Earth.  Oh, yes.  Doc Brown.  Would he be able to figure it out?  Probably that pine farm.  Yeah, pine farm.  Well, Steamfitter Rich writes rubber dicks will be the last thing.  Dildos?  Yeah, rubber.  No, he just writes rubber dicks.  Rubber dicks.  Yeah.  I really, now I just have no idea.  I'm so confused now. 
[01:14:00]  The ships that were sunk for artificial reefs, shut up.  Rich from New Hampshire, the last thing on Earth will be Al Pacino's lifts.  Yeah.  My lifts.  Make me taller than the Great Pyramids.  My wig got knocked off by solar winds.  Wendy from the great city of Cincinnati, who has the mare that throws like a girl.  Yeah.  Titanium fake legs, also known as spatula legs. 
[01:14:30]  Spatula feet.  Will be the last things remaining.  Yeah.  Al from Connecticut.  Yeah.  You're forgetting the most obvious thing.  The last thing left on the planet will be a Foundry Music logo.  It's called Lunar Winds.  Solar Winds, dummy.  Cartman from Indiana writes that.  Satellites trapped in Earth's orbit.  What about that one, Ant?  They'll eventually crash and burn up in the atmosphere.  That's a stupid answer.  McDonald's arch will be the last thing remaining. 
[01:15:00]  No, no, no, no.  The Russian flag beneath the North Pole.  What's that about?  I don't know, but...  They have a flag in the ice somewhere?  In the ice?  Who will see that?  Yeah, no one's going to see it.  No one knows where that is.  Roger C. from Atlanta.  Tippy Tom's petrified underwear.  Oh, a banana, my Tippy Tom.  And, of course, missing the obvious hack answer.  I like how this guy writes this.  It's going to be Keith Richards.  Ah, it's going to be good.  Right, great.  Let's go to TJ in North Carolina.  TJ.  Hey, what's going on, man? 
[01:15:30]  I think the last thing that's going to be left is a wasteland of rubber penises, dildos,  cock rings, and pocket pussies.  All in a landfill.  Wouldn't that be great if that was just our legacy?  Yeah.  Except for Alabama.  Sex toys.  That would be great.  Alabama and the Middle East.  Thank you, sir.  We're going to try to get Dr. Kaku on the phone if he's up.  Dr. Michu Kaku.  Time is like a river.  We know.  We know.  We got it.  There are eddies and swirling whirlpools and rocks that deflect time. 
[01:16:00]  And we...  What?  The last thing.  He'll give some funny answer first.  Yeah.  I would like to know his opinion.  Flavor Flav's teeth is coming in.  Iron Cheek's piss pants.  That's Jay from New York.  Piss pants.  Uh, Matthew.  Peter Frampton comes to live records.  Uh, Nicoliki's gravel-filled implants.  Jesus Christ. 
[01:16:30]  Wow.  That's a little harsh.  It's been a year, bro.  Jesus.  Uh...  Let it go.  Diamonds already over a billion years old.  How hard would it be to last another billion or two?  That's the question this, uh, person asked.  Yeah.  The cut diamonds, I think, are a real biggie, man.  By the way, instant feedbackers with the cell phones, write your name or you don't get credit.  I don't know what, uh, I could read your phone number for your credit.  Would beings look at that, cut diamonds, and think it's a natural formation?  Like, somehow these crystallized in that shape naturally? 
[01:17:00]  Or would they think that, like, we look at an arrowhead and know that, you know, it was kind of cut out of something?  If they're advanced enough to get here, oh, they would understand completely what's not a natural...  Maybe they just really know how to build great spaceships, but they're fucking retarded, right?  Wouldn't that be great?  They have spaceships made out of rocks and wood.  Ugh, ugh, ugh.  These are mongoloids getting out of a ship.  They're just really good at space travel.  They stink at everything else.  They pick up a fucking pebble and go, 
[01:17:30]  Hey, they're people!  They understand thermonuclear physics, but they still rape their women and wear loincloths.  And shit on their own feet.  Pudges of dummies.  Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh.  You know, through a wormhole in space.  Just one side of their head is really giant.  Yeah, yeah.  That side that...  That side that you would need to get here.  I don't know what fucking side it would be.  On the brain.  What side would be the big part of the brain?  And by the way, Keith, Jay, in Niagara Falls, I was right about the Grand Canyon. 
[01:18:00]  It was built by millions of people.  Yes.  With millions of little spoons.  Is that it?  And they all just took one spoonful.  That's how many people that were there.  That was your job, to take one spoonful and walk many, many miles and dump it somewhere.  Scott in Ontario.  Hey, I was wondering if I could give Opia a call on his styrofoam.  Did I say styrofoam?  Styrofoam?  Styrofoam?  Did I say that?  Fuck.  You might as well start a list of my POFAs. 
[01:18:30]  You're going to call Rich Voss on it.  I'm going to call you out.  You live in Canada.  Nah.  Nothing.  Freaking dummy.  Joe in Idaho.  Joe.  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning, Joe.  How's the potato state?  Oh, damn good.  Damn good.  Happy birthday, Yimmy.  What's up, Joe?  Well, the one thing that's going to last for other gentlemen is Patty's virginity.  Oh, wow.  How old is Patty these days? 
[01:19:00]  I know she's got diamonds beat by four years, eight months.  I know we lost her to the Ron and Fez show years ago.  How's she doing?  Oh, my goodness.  Is she doing good?  I don't know.  I haven't heard from her.  I'm sure she would stop by.  I think people are scared to come by.  She's coming by in a couple weeks, actually.  Oh, is she?  Oh, we can't wait.  Thank God.  Thank God.  Goody, goody gumdrops.  Wait.  Someone is saying your answer is the correct one.  Fred in PA.  Fred?  Hey.  Got Anthony's exhaust. 
[01:19:30]  Exhaust.  Oh.  That's right.  It doesn't last a week.  Oh, you fucker.  Holy shit.  He's beating on my automobile.  Automobile.  And I guess that's it.  Opie's stinky sweatpants will outlive everything.  I'm trying to see if there's any other good answers.  So, what is the answer?  We don't really have an answer.  No, we never got an answer.  We just kind of discussed.  I kind of like the moon stuff.  We put it out there and you discuss. 
[01:20:00]  Moon stuff will be gone.  Moon stuff will be gone in a couple thousand years.  Diamonds or nuclear shit?  I say diamonds.  Cut diamonds.  Yes.  Yes.  That's what I think.  What about an ice rink?  I don't know where it is.  During the ice age.  You know?  The one I'm proposing in Honolulu doesn't have a shot.  I'm proposing outdoor hockey in Honolulu.  And I've dumped $2,400,000 into this thing already.  We can't get the ice to freeze. 
[01:20:30]  I mean the water to freeze.  Uh-oh.  Wow.  NORAD.  Someone's saying NORAD.  Where is NORAD?  That's pretty good.  It's in a mountain.  I hear NORAD doesn't really exist.  Wouldn't continental shifts and stuff crush it?  I don't know.  Maybe.  You might be right.  They take a long time.  Act like they happen every eight months.  God, there's something that will wreck everything.  No matter what you think of, something can wreck it.  How about Opie's first communion money?  Oh, damn. 
[01:21:00]  That's a goof on your thriftiness.  That you still have your communion money.  You never spent it because you're cheap.  Oh, that hurts.  That's what that man was saying.  That hurts.  Your communion.  That'll leave a bruise.  Oh, that hurts.  Damn.  And then going back to that crappy underwater hotel in Florida.  Someone writes, that piece of shit.  We hate that place.  That'll be gone by 2011.  That moldy fucking death trap. 
[01:21:30]  As much as we love Blanket and the fact that he hates the light, God, we hate that underwater  hotel in Florida.  He'd like it.  The biggest waste of time and money ever.  There is no answer.  How many people leave that dumb thing and go, wow, that's a big disappointment?  What a fucking waste of time that was.  Didn't we get somebody that worked there talking about all the fucking mold?  It sucks.  It's just so wet and musty.  It smells like fucking feet.  It's just moist everywhere.  Ew. 
[01:22:00]  WWE prizes?  Want to give one away, Dan?  Oh, I thought that was an answer.  Yeah, we can give a couple of them away.  What do we got?  Cool stuff?  Yeah, it does tons of DVDs and cool stuff.  Just if you're a WWE fan, you're going to like whatever we got for you.  What's the slug line?  I got it fine.  I think it's some, what, classic wrestling or something?  I forgot.  I think they're promoting their On Demand channel.  Right.  Oh, hang on.  I will tell you right now.  Okay. 
[01:22:30]  The wiffle ball bat from the studio will be the last thing that remains.  Aw.  The best classic and current wrestling from the world's largest wrestling library.  To subscribe, call 1-888-WWE-CLASSICS.  That's it?  That's it.  All right, start calling if you want a WWE prize pack.  And we're going to go backstage.  You said Simple Mike.  Oh, no, that was during the break.  Yeah, well, you guys can talk to him later if you want about that.  All right.  He's an ass.  Well, if you remember, we made Simple Mike the executive intern. 
[01:23:00]  Yes, we did.  Well, Sam went backstage to see how that was going.  And now, backstage with O&A, here is Primetime Sam Roberts.  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and douchey rich boy intern Simple Mike was recently promoted  to executive intern of the O.B. and Anthony Show.  We found Mike to get the lowdown on what he's been doing with his new disability.  Simple Mike, what have you been doing since you took on this role of executive intern? 
[01:23:30]  I've been letting people have a lot more independence in the workplace and make their own decisions.  Meaning you've been doing kind of nothing?  Well, looking for self-motivation through my peons, yeah.  Peons?  Employees, employees, whatever.  Are you finding that these guys have a lot of self-motivation?  Yeah, actually.  On the other business model, the tyrant business model, people were scared to sort of blossom  and really go out there and give it their all.  And now that I'm running a much more nurturing environment to personally succeed, 
[01:24:00]  I think they're showing a lot more tenacity.  Are there any kind of weak links right now, if you could tell me candidly?  I really do think our weak link right now creatively, I think Matt might be one of our weaker characters.  But, you know, we are working with him.  We're proud of him.  So right now, sort of your goal as executive intern would be to improve Matt?  He does have the skills.  I think he just needs to learn to apply them better.  Do you think you'll be able to teach him how to do that?  Oh, definitely.  Definitely.  I wouldn't be here if that wasn't the case.  Sounds like Mike has everything under control and has his team all lined up and working together. 
[01:24:30]  We found some of the little nobodies running around and asked how they, their new leader, was doing.  Intern Pierce, how do you think Simple Mike's been doing as executive intern, your boss?  Terrible.  Really?  Yeah.  What's he been doing?  Nothing.  Would you say that he is the intern most suited or least suited for that position?  Probably most suited.  Has he motivated you?  Yeah, somewhat.  How? 
[01:25:00]  To be better because he sucks, so.  Oh, okay.  I understand.  So, Evan, what do you think of the job intern Simple Mike is doing of executive intern, your boss?  Terrible.  What has he done to lead the team?  Only unite the rest of us in hatred towards him.  So, intern Matt, what do you think of the job that executive intern Simple Mike, your boss, is doing?  Who?  Simple Mike.  Yeah, that name doesn't ring a bell. 
[01:25:30]  He's the executive intern who said that you were probably the weakest link on the intern team.  Well, I haven't been introduced to this Mike, nor has he shown his face in my presence while I'm working.  You talk to him on the air.  Oh, that cunt?  Yeah.  Oh, I don't acknowledge his existence anymore.  He's your boss.  He's dead to me.  There is a legitimate hatred amongst the interns for Simple Mike.  Lucky for us, we don't acknowledge any of the interns as being emoting human beings, so the way they feel has literally zero effect on our day. 
[01:26:00]  I'm Primetime Sam Roberts, and this has been...  Backstage with ONA.  Mars, you've got to fix the phones, please.  Very important to this radio show.  And Ant and I, on the same page, big time.  This slob, Wendy Williams, has a TV show.  It's good for her.  I'm happy that...  Whatever.  I'm happy for her.  I don't know the bitch, but I'm happy for her. 
[01:26:30]  I'm sure she's excited about having a TV show.  And by the way, she will blow off her radio audience because there's an article in the paper.  Her radio audience here in New York, very nervous.  Yeah.  And she's even saying, well, I'm going to do both for now.  For now.  She wants to be a TV star bad.  Of course she does.  But she's a monster.  And they're trying to play it like she's some kind of diva.  Dude, this is something that's been going on for a while now, and something's got to be said.  Google image Wendy Williams if you don't know who she is. 
[01:27:00]  She's a monster.  This is nothing about her getting a show because, like, great.  Whatever.  Great success to you.  Whatever.  Great success.  Great success.  But this is a trend that happens.  Black women can be utter slobs, giant fat pigs, squeezed into dresses that are too small for them, with giant fat legs, asses, bellies, tits, everything just giantly fat. 
[01:27:30]  A man's face.  A man's face.  A horrible weave, wig, whatever the fuck you want to call it.  And they strut around.  And this Wendy Williams, they're playing her up.  Like, look at her.  She puts on this sexy face like, look at me.  All the guys are after me.  No.  You're a monster.  She really is a monster.  You're a monster.  The promos for the show here in New York, they're just around the clock.  They're pushing the show big time here in New York especially. 
[01:28:00]  And she's posing, trying to look sexy.  She's doing that, like, that look down.  If a girl looks down, it could be really, really hot.  Yeah.  Really hot.  They're overplaying that with her.  She's looking down like, oh, look at me, baby.  Look at me.  No one's saying she's fucking sexy.  She's got the biggest breast implants I've ever seen in my life.  Disgusting.  She's just a monster.  She's one.  And another one is fucking Queen Latifah. 
[01:28:30]  Don't fucking pawn her off as a sex symbol.  Come on.  A sex symbol?  Well, then why is she doing Revlon fucking ads?  Oh, good point.  And shit like that.  Look at you shutting me up very easily.  And they're showing her, like, oh, trying to be sexy and shit.  You're right.  She's not sexy.  You're fucking right.  Then that fucking giant slob that hosted Showtime at the Apollo for a little while.  The fuck is her name?  She's a comic.  I'm not even sure.  Monique.  She's funny.  Shut it.  But they don't pawn her off as a sex symbol. 
[01:29:00]  Come on.  I watched Showtime at the Apollo.  They pawn her off.  And she talks about how sexy.  She goes, look at my dress.  How am I looking tonight, everybody?  And they're like, woo, woo.  And she looks like a fucking monster.  Yeah.  Sherry Shepard on The View.  They don't fucking pawn.  Are they trying to pawn her off as being sexy?  No.  Come on.  There's something about a black, huge black women that think they're sexy. 
[01:29:30]  Someone's telling them that they're sexy.  They're not.  I don't hear anyone talking about how Wendy Williams is hot.  I haven't heard one person say Wendy Williams is fucking hot.  But she's parading around.  She looks like.  Because her yes people told her she's hot.  And what is it with these black women that look like trannies?  Yeah.  She looks like one.  Tyra Banks, who I was in love with years ago.  She's getting a tranny look to her. 
[01:30:00]  She has a tranny look to her.  Right?  It's these bad fucking hair wig weave things that just.  And Wendy Williams looks like a man.  Dude, she was doing her first show yesterday.  And it was on in studio here on one of our many, many TVs.  We lost one of our TVs to a guy that fucking hates our guts.  We'll have to get into that eventually.  Yeah, you know, how do we, they're pilfering our televisions.  We're down to two, five, we're down to seven TVs in studio.  We had eight. 
[01:30:30]  What was it?  Oh, so she was on and she was like doing some like audience work.  Yeah.  And she's a monster.  She is so fucking huge.  Giant.  They showed her walking around in the audience and it just giant.  Well, there's, uh, which Simmons is that?  Russell or the other one?  That looks like Russell.  Russell Simmons.  There's a picture we're looking at of Russell Simmons standing right next to Wendy Williams.  You don't think she looks sexy there, honestly?  Oh, fuck.  I might even bullshit.  You don't, really?  No, man.  In that picture of Russell Simmons?  No.  She's too intimidating.  She looks like a tranny. 
[01:31:00]  As a guy, you don't want your broad to be intimidating.  She's too big.  Her face is that of a man.  She is a man.  You find that sexy for real, Jimmy?  Yeah, man.  What part?  No.  Because she's just, I don't know.  She's like, she's tall.  She's not fat.  She's not fat.  She's a big girl, but she's not fat.  Maybe not.  In that picture, she does look fat.  If you look at her, she is fucking fat.  I will bet money this girl is 170 pounds easy.  Easy.  Easy 170.  Probably pushing 200, to be fair. 
[01:31:30]  That is a big girl.  We're not even talking about fat.  Fat is a whole other category.  There's also monster.  Did you see her squeezed into that fucking dress they put her in?  Yesterday.  For her show.  It was like, I was mesmerized.  I couldn't take my eyes off of how they fucking got her in that thing.  And her giant ham leg was sticking out.  And she's huge.  She's fucking huge.  Do we have any stats on her? 
[01:32:00]  How tall is she, Dan?  And let me tell you something.  How much does she weigh?  Oprah, very huge woman, does the talk show.  Her weight goes up and down.  But when she started, especially, just a big woman, big black woman.  She's doing a talk show.  Never tried to portray herself as sexy.  How about this?  The word diva is used a lot these days.  Yeah.  Have you ever seen a hot diva?  No.  But the word itself is supposed to mean that this person is hot and sexy. 
[01:32:30]  Well, they use it for, what's her name?  R-E-S-P-C-T.  Aretha Franklin.  Aretha Franklin, look, she's a diva.  She's a big, fat mess.  She's a pig roast.  She's a diva.  I'm a diva.  Kevin from Connecticut, he just saw the picture.  Oh, my God.  Wendy Williams looks like Biz Markie in drag.  Yes.  Biz Markie.  Greatest song of all time.  You got what I need.  They bring that song back every, like, two years. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, baby, you.  She looks like Biz Markie.  They let that song rest maybe a year, and then they bring it right back.  Yeah, then it comes back.  Yeah, that Biz Markie song.  Yeah.  Damn.  I don't know why that song is so good.  He's not exactly a crooner.  Oh, no, he's not.  But it is a good one.  A crooner.  You guys want to Google bomb Wendy Williams is a monster today?  Wendy Williams is a monster.  Oh, it's simple.  It's easy.  People can spell it.  Dude, that's the Google bomb of the day. 
[01:33:30]  All right.  Wendy Williams is a monster.  Everybody.  Let's get that done.  Get on that.  Number one trend by 10 o'clock, or we're not doing our jobs today.  Wendy Williams is a monster.  Because that bitch thinks she's sexy.  She's not.  Get the fuck out of here.  Enough with the sassy, sexy fatzos.  You want to be fat?  There are chubby chases out there.  There are guys that would look at her and go, oh, my God, she is the most beautiful thing on the face of the earth.  That's the exception to the rule. 
[01:34:00]  She is a fucking monster.  Wendy Williams is a monster.  That is a great Google bomb.  But how do we fit Bismarcky in there and Blanket?  Let's not forget about Blanket.  Blanket hates the light.  And, Jimmy, you've...  They might have to wait a day.  You've been following the Corey Feldman thing.  Is he still hurting?  I have not, but I keep writing him emails, even though I don't know him.  Yeah.  I'm like, I know you're hurting.  Call if you need to talk.  And he hasn't gotten a hold of me.  Look at the phones.  They're just lit.  We're going with Wendy Williams is a monster. 
[01:34:30]  Wendy Williams is a monster.  Wow.  I think we hit a nerve with the listeners.  Let's say hi to Chris in Jersey.  Chris.  Yo.  Hey, man.  What's up, Chris?  Hey, buddy.  Oh, new rule.  If you have the body of Al Sharpton, you can't be a sexist.  I'm sorry.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's a big, she's a big, fat person.  I mean, I don't think we want our women to be intimidating.  You know what I mean?  Not like that.  It's kind of sexy to be, I don't know, a little... 
[01:35:00]  Dude, for goof, I'd, you know, I'd lay on top of her.  But as far as being seen with her, fuck.  Never.  No, never, ever, ever.  Your body parts are too fucking big.  They're trying so hard to play her off as a sex symbol, as a sexy, look at me.  I'm sexy.  I'm empowered.  I'm sexy.  Look at me in front of my audience.  And all the women, they, ooh, and she poses up on stage. 
[01:35:30]  She throws her hip out.  She fucking looks.  She bats her eyes.  It's like, you're fucking a mess.  Danny's working out the stats, and so far, he's doing pretty good.  So far, we got, she's 45 years old, she claims.  If she's saying she's 45, she's older.  She'll be 45 in a couple of weeks.  She claims her measurements to be 40, 30, 40, and that she's six feet tall.  She's fucking Cloverfield. 
[01:36:00]  Jesus Christ.  She's a big girl, but I'm not kidding.  I would fuck her in a second.  Every picture you see is a glamour shot of her.  They are trying so hard to make her look good in pictures.  You wouldn't bang that to a big girl like that?  Tall?  You shit me.  I swear, a big, tall girl?  Believe me, dude, I love a tall girl.  But they gotta be slender.  Slender, tall is great.  Big, tall is fucking RuPaul.  If you put RuPaul and Wendy Williams in the same room, you couldn't figure out which one 
[01:36:30]  the tranny was.  Dude, guaranteed, people walk up to her and go, RuPaul, how many times a day does Wendy  Williams get called RuPaul?  That would be a close match right there.  Hell yes.  I mean, a lot of people know who RuPaul looks like, but let's bring some aliens into the  room.  Aliens have to decide which one's the tranny.  Guess what?  It's gonna be a real close match.  Yeah, it's a close one.  I'd say RuPaul pulls it out, but barely. 
[01:37:00]  RuPaul's got a more feminine body.  Footer.  Yeah, good morning, boys.  Hello, footer.  Danny just found the worst picture of RuPaul ever.  Go to the left.  Let me see, Ru.  Danny finds fantastic pictures, man.  Oh, boy.  What happened to RuPaul, huh?  Looks like his face is melting in that picture.  I don't think that Ru looks good there, because she shouldn't be in blonde hair.  She.  She.  Yeah, all right, Jimmy.  Ah, footer. 
[01:37:30]  What's up?  Some respect from you two.  Just because you make an error or two doesn't mean we gotta fucking jump on your bandwagon.  Error.  Error.  Please.  Okay.  Leave their names at the front door.  And on purpose.  Just call yourself RP.  What's up, footer?  Yo, what's up?  Yeah, they have the baseball, like the Hall of Fame stuff going on, and they have the celebrity  softball game.  And Ashanti was out there.  And Ashanti used to be like really, I thought she would be really hot.  Her ass, dude, in those freaking baseball pants or whatever, were so fucking big. 
[01:38:00]  Really?  Oh, dude, it was ridiculous.  And then real quick, number two, just by the qualifications of what a diva is, what  you guys are naming, is Error a diva?  Error would, yes, Error would be considered a diva.  If you put a wig on him.  Error has the body of a diva.  We're looking at a, we're looking at a picture of a diva.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  Watch it out, boys.  Everybody's back.  Thank you.  She looks like she has like a red lobster bib on.  Yeah.  It's supposed to be a sexy top.  It's a sexy top.  It looks like she's sexy and sassy.  It looks like she's getting ready to eat a lot of lobster. 
[01:38:30]  She's sexy and sassy.  Look at the fucking big fat arms, Jimmy.  Are you kidding me?  I am, I'm not in love with her, but look at her hip.  Her waist is not big, dude.  She's a big girl.  Maybe not in that picture.  I don't know when that was taken.  She's on the bigger side, but I'm not kidding.  I would absolutely have sex with her.  Oh.  In a second.  You're crazy.  I'm not even, breasts are too big.  I would, I just like the fact that she's tall and she probably has a nice thick hiney.  Oh, God.  Of course she's got a thick, big, uh, uh, cellulite.  Cellulite. 
[01:39:00]  Cellulite, hiney.  Oh, man.  Oh.  Not, not, don't play it off like that.  Uh, she should, she plays it off like a sexy diva and that's the only thing I'm, I'm,  I'm getting on.  You want to do a talk show?  You want to fuck it?  Yeah.  Fine.  But don't try to, who are you bullshit?  They're trying to say to us, the viewers, that she's like sexy and, you know.  Yeah.  They shove it down your throat.  And we say no.  No.  Monster.  No.  She's the type of girl, this is what turns me on about her.  She's the type of girl who would look up at you and kind of squeeze your balls and she'd 
[01:39:30]  have long nails, not to the point of agony, but just a little pain.  And she would go like, do you like that?  And as she did that, like the jewelry on her hand would jingle.  Would jingle.  Yeah.  She'd go, okay, now squeeze my balls.  No, I don't think she has balls.  I bet she'd.  But she'd probably spank you well.  She'd probably be a good dominant.  No.  The phones are great.  Listen to this one.  Pat in the Bronx.  Pat.  Hi, what's up, guys?  Hey.  You freaking rule, bro.  Love you.  Thank you, sir.  Listen, I worked out by the clubs in Manhattan. 
[01:40:00]  He said Opie.  These girls, they never go.  Go ahead.  Sorry, sir.  Danny interrupted.  By the way, when you guys give one guy a compliment on the show, we all hear our own  names.  Of course.  Exactly.  I'm just fucking with you.  Yeah, what would you say?  Who was he like?  Ant.  All right, cool.  Thank you.  I thought so.  Thank you.  I really appreciate it.  Go ahead.  Go.  Same joke twice.  Go, sir.  I worked out by the clubs in Manhattan.  These girls never go home alone.  Ask Keith the cop.  Never.  They never go home alone. 
[01:40:30]  You know what sucks?  On the phone it said, work near the clubs in Manhattan.  Those things never go home alone.  Thank you, Pat.  Yeah.  No problem.  All right, brother.  Let's go to Cheryl in ATL.  That would be ATL, ATL.  Hotland.  Hotland.  Hotland.  Cheryl?  Hello.  Hi, Cheryl.  Hey, how are you doing?  Better now that you called, Cher.  I'm just here to say that there's no freaking way that girl's 170. 
[01:41:00]  I'm 170, and I'm on Jimmy's page.  I've been friends with him for a while on MySpace.  Oh, Jimmy.  Oh, what's your name on MySpace?  Hmm?  What's your name on MySpace?  You and I have been friends on MySpace?  Mm-hmm.  It's Bob.  What's your name on MySpace?  Cheryl.  Never heard of you.  I think.  No, I'm like you.  Where are you from?  I'm originally from Boston.  Who cares?  You're nobody to me.  Sorry.  Same joke twice.  Go ahead.  Fuck 70.  I apologize.  Wow. 
[01:41:30]  I'm something when I think of you in my dreams, all right?  What do you think you're doing to me in your dreams, Cheryl?  Oh, don't you worry.  You better be 12 feet tall.  No, I'm a short little thing.  Do you think of us having sex in your dreams?  Hell, yeah.  And how tall are you?  5'4".  170?  Mm-hmm.  Keep dreaming.  Oh, something happened.  She ate her phone.  She's a nice girl.  Sorry, Cheryl.  I was just teasing.  All right.  Pestgaming.com.  Tree Fort Rich.  Yeah, we know him. 
[01:42:00]  Oh.  Tree Fort Rich.  He writes, Wendy Williams.  This is perfect.  This is what she looks like.  Perfect.  Wendy Williams looks like an NFL linebacker dressed as anyone?  Marilyn Monroe.  Don't give yourself a bell.  Give yourself nothing.  Damn it.  Look, look, look.  A big star.  They just showed her.  She was on the world stage recently.  Her name would be NFL linebacker dressed as Mariah Carey. 
[01:42:30]  Give yourself a fucking bell, motherfucker.  God damn it.  I gave myself two bells.  God damn it.  Two bells for me.  That's exactly what she looks like.  Yeah.  She does have a little, like, Mariah Carey in her face.  Oh, God.  A little bit.  A little bit.  I ain't saying it.  ARP in Boston.  ARP.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey, man.  They won't fucking kill you.  I'm driving over the Toadon Bridge, and I have my radio blaring, and he's not going  off about black women.  I look over to my left, and a chick taking my toes is a 400-pound black lady giving me 
[01:43:00]  the death stare.  I thought she was going to eat my little white body.  She wasn't happy.  What are you going to do?  You know, I calls him as I sees him.  I'm not going to.  Love you guys.  Thank you, sir.  Is her show good?  I don't even know.  I don't know.  It's not made for us, obviously.  It's an audience full of, like, housewife-looking women, and I guess they just have a little  girl chat.  They talk about, you know, being diva and being sassy and how to keep your man and all that 
[01:43:30]  stuff.  Why don't we get Sam on it?  Sam's like that pop culture.  Get Sam.  I can't get enough.  Sam.  Commercials alone.  Look at her.  Look.  Look at what they're trying to do.  She took her hand and threw her hair back.  I'm sorry that we're bringing this to everyone's attention, but they're running the promos here  in New York.  Honestly, every commercial break.  It's every break.  For the last three or four days.  Sam, you've got to watch this Wendy Williams show and give us a report.  Yes.  Have you watched the Wendy Williams show?  We need some recordings. 
[01:44:00]  Actually, I've seen it.  Yeah.  What is it about?  Is it Oprah?  What are they talking about?  I love how these new talk shows all make believe they're doing something different, and  then you watch, and they go, oh, you're doing Oprah.  Okay.  You want to be the new Oprah.  Yeah.  It's like a younger, somewhat edgier, and sillier version of Tyra.  Let me let that sink in for a minute.  Wait.  It's a what?  It's like a younger and kind of like a sillier and somewhat edgier version of Tyra.  It's not serious like Oprah.  She's not tackling things. 
[01:44:30]  Well, she could.  Well.  I wish I could have come up with a football player.  Huh.  Well, somebody's turning me on to the fact that Method Man threatened Wendy Williams after  she broke a story about his wife having cancer, and there's a video on YouTube.  Wow.  Really?  Where he's basically threatening her.  She got in trouble, too, for, uh, she's, uh, who was it she said was pregnant or something,  and she got in deep shit for that?  Yeah, she was always getting in trouble on the radio and, you know, the station she worked  at, I think.  Wasn't that the station that gunfire would always erupt out in front of? 
[01:45:00]  Oh, this just in.  Holy shit.  And it says AP.  It's got to be true.  Oh.  Uh, UFC 102?  Yeah.  Brock Lesnar.  They got his, uh, next.  Oh, no.  Wait a minute.  Are you saying?  You want to finish this?  This is breaking news?  Breaking news, Andy.  Brock Lesnar, the champion, the challenger, is going to be Wendy Williams.  Yes.  Wow.  What a match that'll be.  This just in.  Lesnar could lose that one.  Thank you, Ratspit from PalTalk, for the breaking news.  Lesnar absolutely could lose that one to, uh, Wendy Williams. 
[01:45:30]  Remember, uh, Google bomb we're doing today is, Wendy Williams is a monster.  Oh.  Ha ha ha ha.  What's the matter?  That's not nice.  Wendy Williams is a monster.  She is.  That's not a nice thing to say about her.  Stop sticking up your fellow black.  She's a giant, big, fat woman that they're playing off like a, a, a beauty queen on her  show.  And anyone saying they'd bang her, you know what that would look like once that fucking  weave comes off in the bedroom?  Once she pulls her fucking hair off?  They'd act like I've never gotten down in the trenches before. 
[01:46:00]  I really would, too.  Let's go cartoon.  You asked a question.  It would be like that episode of the Flintstones where, uh, uh, Dino.  And remember the girl?  I don't remember the girl's name.  No, that's where I need your help.  It's a goof on Lassie.  Uh, Sassy.  Sassy.  Sassy.  I do know that.  Right.  Dino is in love with Sassy.  In love until Dino saw the hair weave come off.  And the makeup.  And the eyelashes came off.  Yeah.  And Sassy looked like shit.  And Dino's like, uh-uh. 
[01:46:30]  And got the fuck out of there.  That's why you gotta get a girl that's beautiful when she's natural.  Sassy.  Uh, Jeremy.  Cleveland.  Hey, boys.  What's going on?  Hello.  Hey.  Take off the hair, the makeup, and all the weave.  She looks like Jay-Z, man.  Jay-Z with a wig.  Oh, boy.  Hey, Jeremy.  When are you coming back?  When are you coming back to Cleveland?  I don't know.  I am actually working on something in, uh, Cleveland.  No, you're not.  I really am.  No, you're really not.  I'm-  I know you're not. 
[01:47:00]  You're right.  Don't lie to me.  Okay, boys.  Never.  I'll never be in Cleveland again.  Ohio's dead to me.  Puddle of AIDS.  Her face looks like Ari from Planet of the Apes.  I don't know that one.  Ari?  It might be worth, uh, putting out there.  A-R-I?  Ari?  Am I saying it right?  Ari?  Oh, uh, what was that?  One of the professors or doctors or something?  All right.  Maybe it's too obscure.  Just stick with Zaius or something.  All right.  Here's another very good question by, uh, Justin in New York.  Justin.  Yeah.  Um, fellas.  I want to know.  Serena Williams. 
[01:47:30]  Would you give her the business?  Fuck you.  Who wouldn't bang?  Absolutely.  What are the circumstances?  She's willing.  Yeah.  Would you have to-  Would you have to tell your brothers about it?  You'd have to, uh, you'd have to make a 30-minute drive to her house to bang her.  Is it worth it or not?  Uh, 30 minutes.  That's-  Pop-up Serena Williams.  Dude, she's fucking must-  Yeah.  Dude, she's another monster.  But Serena Williams would fuck your brains out.  I'm done with these bras.  They shove in her face and make believe they're sexy when they're monsters.  Just because they have tits doesn't mean they're- 
[01:48:00]  Patrice would love the shit out of this girl.  Just because they have tits doesn't mean they're fuckable, man.  That's a monster.  I'm talking about big athletic legs.  An athlete, a tennis player?  She's a monster.  Oh, dude, I'd fuck her in a sense.  You wouldn't fuck that chick?  Are you nuts?  Look at her ass.  Look at that.  It is giant.  That ass would squeeze your dick right off your body.  Oh, fuck yeah.  That would hurt.  I would give her the worst fuck of her life.  I'd be hurting like Corey Feldman.  Do you know how badly I would bomb in bed with her?  I'd be so intimidated my dick would shrivel.  Holy shit.  You would fuck that.  You're- 
[01:48:30]  Absolutely.  She's in a small bikini.  Without a doubt, I'd fuck that.  And make believe she's white.  Would you fuck that?  No.  Because let's get the black thing out of the way so we can get a real answer from you.  You know who's looking hot?  I just saw her on that goddamn TV show.  The other chick from Destiny's Child.  The other one.  Michelle Williams or Kelly Rowland?  Oh, Kelly Rowland I always thought was hot.  Yeah, yeah.  She's like, I just saw her on-  What?  She's no Beyonce.  Well, no, she's not Beyonce.  I think Kelly Rowland is hotter than Beyonce.  I think she's hotter than Beyonce, to tell you the truth.  Absolutely.  You would fuck that? 
[01:49:00]  Jesus.  Get the fuck out of here.  Jesus Christ.  I would fuck Shrede Williams.  You crazy mess.  I absolutely would fuck Serena Williams.  Come on, Jimmy.  Dude, I absolutely-  I believe you, but-  A nice big juicy hiney like that from the back?  Juicy?  Yes.  You'd go down on her and she'd squash your fucking skull like a walnut.  Look at the acid.  You're going to tell me you wouldn't at least put it in her pussy a little-  Look at the fucking juicy hiney on her.  How would you not fuck that?  How is that-  You don't want a juicy hiney.  Dude, yes you do.  Let's go to the expert of juicy hineys.  Danny, step up to the mic. 
[01:49:30]  I like a juicy hiney.  Um, Serena Williams, I wouldn't quite say is the most attractive girl out there.  Right.  Yeah.  But there ain't nothing wrong with that hiney.  Really?  You'd get behind her and fuck her, wouldn't you?  How do you not get behind Serena Williams and put your dick in her?  Your dick wouldn't reach.  You'd think your dick would reach from the back end?  You'd think you could stand her against the wall and fuck her from behind and hit a pussy?  No.  Again, for her, it would be a bore fest.  She'd probably just turn around and go, go home.  Go home, little white man. 
[01:50:00]  Look at that.  But I would absolutely fuck her.  Look at that.  How do you not want to just, even if you're on top of her, how do you not want to reach  under and just hold that juicy hiney?  Her weight goes up and down.  And you're showing some pictures where she's not as-  Some pictures, not as bad.  Serena Williams.  But she really is a monster.  I mean-  Let me see.  I'm not into having sex with monsters.  Look at that.  Is that her?  Yes.  All right.  Let's think this over here.  That looks pretty good in the tennis shorts.  Hold on, man.  Let me slow down a little bit.  Pull down those little tennis shorts.  She's bent all the way over trying to pick up a ball or she's tying her shoe. 
[01:50:30]  And her ass is sticking out.  What she's just saying?  Look at this.  She's sticking out.  She's in a little white tennis skirt with the white shorts.  That is a hot picture.  I'll give you that.  Maybe that's not her, though.  Maybe they're pawing it off as a show.  Yeah, yeah.  Maybe.  I'm onto there, trickery.  Yeah, who the fuck knows?  I'm onto there, trickery.  Chicanery.  Big, long, smooth legs.  Makes me want that shit.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Mm.  Her ass looks good there, but the face looks terrible. 
[01:51:00]  Dude.  That's not a good picture.  L-T.  Yeah, it's not a good picture.  You don't want to see Serena Williams with her face-  You know what?  Separated from her hair by a hat, because then the face is isolated.  Yeah.  And she just looks like a thug.  I saw a recent picture of her sister.  Not bad.  Actually, I was flying on JetBlue, and they had some kind of press conference.  It needed the money!  On JetBlue?  What a weird place for a press conference.  I was watching ESPN, and there was some kind of press conference going on.  Venus needed the money.  Well, no, no, you got to go with a recent picture, because I'm telling you, most pictures 
[01:51:30]  you see on the Google image is not going to prove my case, and I got to say that right  out of the box here.  What's that bikini one?  But a current picture of her from this past Wimbledon, she wasn't that bad.  No, see, I can't defend these pictures.  She's got that marathon runner arms.  Yeah, I can't defend these pictures.  I'm just saying-  You can't defend these pictures.  No, the one-  What about the shower shot down there?  What is that?  It was just her sitting and taking questions.  I was like, you know what?  She's come a long way. 
[01:52:00]  No, I'm telling you, I can't defend that.  Look, you can't defend it.  I'm fucking-  I'm defenseless against this.  I am very vulnerable.  Oh, here we go.  Here we go.  Oh, my God.  We were only going to do two minutes on Wendy Williams.  We had it penciled in as a two-minute segment.  James the Trucker.  It's taken on a life of its own.  Yeah, I was going to ask you guys who you thought the bigger monster was between Wanda  from N11 Color or Wendy Williams?  You know, they're close.  Yeah.  Can I see a picture of Wanda so I can make my decision? 
[01:52:30]  And then who would you guys pop?  You have to go girl every time.  Gosh, man, that's so bad.  That's a trick question.  You have to at least go girl every time.  What the fuck?  That's Wendy Williams.  Yes.  That's fucking-  There's no difference.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  Okay, thanks.  Very good.  Wendy Williams wants to- 
[01:53:00]  Wow, she's on the phone.  I want to defend myself and clear things up with you boys.  All right.  Wendy Williams, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi, boys.  Hi, Wendy.  Hi, Wendy.  I want to clear up some of these issues.  I'm not a monster.  All right.  Well, you sure look like one in these promos, right?  Yeah.  Excuse me.  I do not look like Wanda the Ugly Woman.  Maybe Shanay-Nay from Martin, but not Wanda the Ugly Woman. 
[01:53:30]  All right.  My mother was McGillagorilla, and my father was Wanda-Nay.  Oh, Jesus.  Why?  It always-  Why?  Fucking-  My goodness.  Uh, let's go to Mike in Toronto.  Mike.  Oh, Jesus.  Is that Shanay-Nay from Martin?  We were having the Serena-Venus debate at work the other day, and I couldn't believe  that a majority of the guys I work with actually side with Opie.  I couldn't believe it.  I almost shit myself.  I banged Serena in a heartbeat.  So did I, man.  No, Venus is starting to look good.  I'm telling you.  Like, they got to update the images on Google, because I can't find a good picture of her. 
[01:54:00]  But recently, I saw her, and I'm telling you, I'm like, huh.  Yeah.  No way.  I go with Jim Rome on me.  She's Predator.  I think-  Yeah.  Yeah, that was a very good line by Rome.  That's one of his classics.  Uh, but I think they might have pushed her teeth back into her head or something.  Oh, God.  That's the least they could do.  All right, sir.  Thank you.  Uh, all right.  Here's a very good question.  Oh, no.  I-  Wow.  I don't know the answers to this.  Chad in Chicago.  Go ahead. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah, I was-  I was wondering, which one would you rather fuck, uh, Wendy Williams or Star Jones?  Holy shit.  Wow.  That's even close.  Star Jones is horrendous.  Star Jones is more of a monster.  You know what, though?  I can't imagine betting either of them.  That is like-  That is the ultimate question.  I have a-  What if the human race was dependent upon you fucking one of the two?  Extinction, my friend.  Extinction.  Yeah. 
[01:55:00]  Is it really important-  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Is it really important for us to be here anyway?  Come on.  It's a planet killer.  Yeah, we'll let it just die.  Let something else take over.  I ain't saving the world by fucking a monster.  I'm sorry.  Fuck that.  What am I, Spock?  The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few of the one?  Fuck you.  I ain't touching that.  Fuck you.  No way, no how.  No way, no how.  Uh-uh.  Ain't happening.  Not me.  Are those the sisters right there?  That kind of looks hot.  Because they're two sisters.  I think if you put- 
[01:55:30]  All right, what, are you going to do some transplants?  Yeah.  Are you going to just chop off a head here and paste on an arm and a leg?  First of all, Serena's ass has to go.  It is giant.  You go with Venus's ass and legs, definitely.  Yeah, a little more manageable.  But I think you take Serena's tits and move that over.  All right, move it over.  Look at Serena's fingers.  Holy shit.  Are you sure they're not males playing in the fucking- 
[01:56:00]  Dude, those-  Come on.  That's a big hand.  Wow.  That's too intimidating.  Jimmy.  Scary.  Not at all.  No.  Palm a beach ball.  She'd palm a medicine ball.  Big feet, too.  She'd hold the back of your head while you ate her box.  She'd fucking force your face right in there.  Oh, dude, yeah.  And then she would laugh at you.  Dude, after all that-  Not if I ate her pussy, no.  She'd cheer me on.  After all that tennis they play, you could never get that thing clean. 
[01:56:30]  Sweaty.  Would you do it right after a tennis match?  Why not?  She's fucking just sweating.  Look at that.  Really?  You would do it right after that?  Look at those man arms.  We're looking at a very sweaty picture of her now.  If you cut that picture, you would think those were two men shaking hands.  Mm-hmm.  Those arms are so muscular and sweaty.  I mean, they're no Mike Woods.  Oh, well.  Oh, another dope we've got to slam around a while.  Woodsy has big arms.  Yeah, Woodsy's a local guy here in New York that is showing off his biceps every morning 
[01:57:00]  now.  For what reason?  I don't know.  I don't know.  That's a-  Oh, this is a very good question, Dan.  Rob in Richmond.  Rob.  Hey.  Hey.  You boys got to go deep south, man.  Okay.  Wendy Williams or Ms. Peaches?  Oh, damn.  The fry that chicken, fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Peaches.  Ms. Peaches.  Everybody wants a piece of my chicken.  Everybody wants a piece of my chicken. 
[01:57:30]  So you're fried chicken.  Finger licking.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Fry that chicken.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, God.  Well, Peaches is Wendy Williams.  They're all the same person.  Just fat women with the blonde wig.  Can you get us some audio of Wendy Williams?  Of course.  I think the only thing we're really interested in is her talking like she's a diva and she's sexy and she's hot.  Yes.  I got to ride up on an elevator with Miss Wendy one time, and she's not fat. 
[01:58:00]  No, she's not.  I don't.  She's got big body parts.  She's got a thin waist.  Did you hear the cables going?  No.  I didn't hear those noises.  No, I did not.  But maybe I would.  Where were you going up in an elevator?  When we were in K-Rock.  She was doing JV and Elvis' show.  Really?  She was doing JV and Elvis' show.  She had her book out.  Okay.  She avoided us.  That was smart on her part.  Well, we just spent 20 minutes.  Well, yeah.  Whatever. 
[01:58:30]  Maybe we'll get our rest from us.  We don't book monsters on our show.  She's not a monster.  Name one monster we've booked on our show.  Monster.  Fabrizio, New York.  If Wendy Williams is a monster, Serena Williams is a beast.  Are you tired from tumbling in the dryer?  Stupid name.  All right.  Thank you.  Stracci Fabrizio.  I'll get rid of line one before we...  Yeah, I know.  I saw it, too. 
[01:59:00]  All right.  See, I even know that's a red flag.  Yeah.  Now they'll try to figure out what it is.  What?  What?  Wendy Williams.  Oh!  Could you give someone a little assignment?  Of course.  I was on Twitter the other day, and...  What is that?  There was a whole thing...  There was a whole thing people were doing.  It took on a life of its own.  I know they say that a lot, but it really did.  Why Chuck Norris isn't on Twitter. 
[01:59:30]  Chuck coming back, huh?  New generation of Chuck Norris fans?  Dude, a million of them.  And I was reading a few of them, like, all right, this is good.  And then I just kept reading them and reading them.  Why?  I swear I thought that was Reggie Jackson.  Oh, with AIDS?  Yeah.  It scared me.  Sorry.  Could you see if you could find some of the better ones?  Oh, yeah.  Something like no one could follow Chuck Norris, you know, that type of thing.  Might be worth a peek.  If not, that's fine. 
[02:00:00]  That's just...  Yeah.  See, it's the takeoff on the whole Chuck Norris.  It's the whole Chuck Norris thing, again.  Right.  But now in the Twitter universe.  Want to take a break?  Talk about why Tony Romo might have dumped Jessica Simpson the night before her 29th birthday party.  Oh.  We also have audio from the South Park episode that made fun of Michael Jackson that we started the show with today.  Some Obama shit.  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Obama had a problem with a teleprompter. 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  Helicopter?  Teleprompter.  It prompts you.  I guess.  He had a little problem with that.  That's a quickie after the break.  A telepropeller.  Debbie Rowe, we did that.  Oh, fucking A.  This guy rules.  You heard about the guy that drove over the edge of the Grand Canyon?  Wow.  That rule.  Look, man.  If you're going to take yourself out, don't be a pussy about it.  Oh, he did it on purpose?  Oh, fuck yeah.  He did.  Plunged 600 feet to his death.  Who is he?  Thelma and Louise?  Yes, exactly.  If I just yelled punchlines like that all the time? 
[02:01:00]  We'll get to the details of that story after the break, too.  That's a good one.  Would that be annoying if I delivered all lines like that?  Say that again.  Yay.  The guy drove off the edge.  Yeah.  Was he trying to die?  Just over-eager, screaming.  And how about we give away another WWE package there, Danny?  It's WWE Day on the Opie and Anthony Show.  Sure, we can do that.  Hang on.  And the slug line is what again?  Just know this.  If you're a wrestling fan, trust me, the prize package will be very, very cool from the WWE.  And how is Seth Green?  Collector's Edition DVD. 
[02:01:30]  Seth Green wrestled in the main event.  Shut the fuck up.  He was great.  He hosted Raw last night, and the main event was Randy Orton and Legacy versus Triple H, John Cena, and Seth Green.  What did Seth do?  He dropped an elbow.  He broke up a pin at one point.  Seth Green is actually noticeably smaller than some of the wrestlers.  I would assume so.  Well, that's what makes it fun.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He just shouldn't be in there.  And then Triple H pulls it off anyway. 
[02:02:00]  Triple H put him up on his shoulder at the end like he was a Make-A-Wish kid or something.  Now, would you fuck Triple H?  Me?  With a blonde wig?  With a blonde wig.  He doesn't need a blonde wig.  Doesn't he have, like, nice flowing locks?  Yeah, that's true.  Yeah.  What's the slug line there, Dan, as we go to break?  The best classic in current wrestling from the world's largest wrestling library.  To subscribe, call 1-888-WWE-CLASSICS.  And we'll continue.  Welcome back to Norton and Friends. 
[02:02:30]  Oh.  Today, my guests are Anthony and Gregory.  Thank you.  And Daniel.  Norton.  And the topic of the day is iPhone apps.  Imagine.  What's your favorite ice cream to eat? 
[02:03:00]  Rocky Road?  While taking a flu shit.  Vanilla?  A flu shit.  Everything goes back to flu shit on my show.  What color hat do you prefer to wear while taking a flu shit?  Your call's next.  I love the idea of taking a flu shit.  There's nothing worse than a flu shit.  I love flu shits.  They're horrible because your legs get numb quick.  And you got a fever, so your nut sack is hanging into the water.  And all of a sudden, you look lighter.  You feel and look lighter.  Like, goddamn, I like this flu thing. 
[02:03:30]  Motorist plunges to his death after driving over edge of Grand Canyon.  Ballsy move.  A man has driven over the edge of the Grand Canyon and plunged 600 feet to his death.  Authorities said rescue personnel found the vehicle and the body of a male below the south rim.  Wow.  Wow.  Damn.  What, did he just fucking gas it?  Incident happened around 6 a.m. Monday near the El Tovar Hotel.  I've been to the Grand Canyon. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah.  I think this is a suicide.  It's not easy to just drive over the edge.  No.  I think he did that on purpose.  They got some safeguards.  Yeah, I think he killed himself.  You'd think he could find a spot that goes a little deeper than 600 feet, though.  You know?  It's deep enough.  Oh, it's plenty deep enough.  Maybe the other places were blocked to drive.  Maybe there's a problem driving there.  Oh, yeah.  I never thought of that.  Yeah.  Okay.  I hiked the Grand Canyon.  Yeah?  It's nice.  Did you see any cars?  Didn't see any cars.  Cars. 
[02:04:30]  What do you think, man?  What do you think that the guy just frigging...  Oh, yeah.  Just hit the gas?  Absolutely.  Grab the steering wheel and go, here we go.  This is it.  I don't even know how you would get speed going.  Yeah?  Why?  You're like...  No, I'm trying to think back to when I was there.  There are places...  It's not a good runway, because it's like there's a road alongside, so then you have to veer  off, I guess.  Maybe that's where there was a good drop-off.  Oh, yeah.  Without a big...  You know, maybe that's why he did that.  There's a lot of...  The guy killed himself, though. 
[02:05:00]  ...pretty desolate places around the Grand Canyon, too, though.  Oh, South Rim near this hotel.  Oh, South Rim.  They're basically saying the main area, where you go if you're a tourist.  Any pictures?  No pictures.  We got any pictures of where he fucking went off?  No.  Oh, wait a minute.  What?  Might have a picture.  Of where he went?  You could have done that closer to home.  It doesn't look...  You know.  If you're going off the Grand Canyon, you should go to one of those spots where it's a mile  down.  And just jump.  Fuck the car thing. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, man.  Jumping's kind of...  Ow.  With a car, at least it's a challenge.  You could be like, how far can I make it?  Dude, the scariest part of the Grand Canyon, when you're hiking down...  I've told the hike stories a lot, but the trail itself drops off on...  On both sides in some areas to just where you would just not survive.  Maybe not a...  Like a sheer drop where you're plummeting?  Maybe not a sheer drop, but it's on such an angle, there's no way you would ever stop 
[02:06:00]  your body from just sliding and tumbling and falling.  Breaking every bone in your body.  And the trail itself, at times, is barely as wide as that doorway.  And then it drops down on both sides.  You're like, holy shit.  That's scary.  It was scary, at times.  But the coolest thing I ever done, right there, my friends.  Grand Canyon's amazing, when you look at that thing.  Fucking amazing.  I can't wait to go back.  Pictures don't do it justice, films, nothing.  But when you're standing there, looking out at that goddamn thing, jeez. 
[02:06:30]  That is really kind of majestic, I think they call it.  Yeah.  Do you know what I want to go on?  Because you reminded me, because the Grand Canyon has that glass thing that's built out.  The Sears Tower had those four extensions put in.  Oh, yeah.  At the 103rd floor.  These, fuck, they go out four feet.  These glass extensions.  You can go out there and just stand over pure glass.  Yeah, so you're standing over glass.  You've never done that?  Because that's not a new thing.  There was one.  In Toronto.  Yes.  That is insane.  I have not done that.  The glass floor is maybe as big as. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Look at that.  That's the Chicago one?  That would be so petrifying to walk out onto that.  Because they say you feel.  And plus to look out and see other people.  Yeah.  They have that at the Sears Tower in Toronto.  It's the same kind of thing.  And all of a sudden you walk across this.  You feel yourself like tiptoeing across because your mind doesn't believe that you're going  to be okay.  You're going to be okay.  Would you stand like that?  No.  It's hard. 
[02:07:30]  On granite.  Yeah.  Dude, it's harder than you think because your mind starts fucking with you going, this  is not normal.  You should not be doing this.  This could break.  Even though there's not a chance in hell it's going to break.  Oh, there's a chance.  No, there's not.  There's always a chance.  That's thick glass, man.  That's thick glass.  Always a chance.  Fuck, no.  Jump up and down.  Take Wendy Williams with you.  See if that fucking monster can't make it break.  We can get back to this subject in a second, but we got the great Dr. Kaku on the phone.  Oh, good.  Dr. Kaku.  Yes.  Hi. 
[02:08:00]  Hi.  You remember us, Opie and Anthony and Jim Norton?  How can I forget?  I like that.  I like how you think.  We have a quick question.  We were throwing around this dumb question today.  Yeah.  Okay.  We were wondering what part of humanity would survive the longest over time after we were  all gone to prove that we were here on Earth?  The last thing.  The last thing. 
[02:08:30]  The last thing to go.  The last thing to go.  The last thing to go that would exist, that would give someone an indication that we had  been here.  Well, if I were to take a stab at it, I think gigantic stone structures, well, like in the  desert, we have the pyramids made out of limestone, and the desert has very little water, which  is water is one of the main reasons why things decay and fall apart.  There's very little water in the desert, so I think that structures like the pyramids and  things like that, the pyramids already are 4,000 years old, and so I think structures 
[02:09:00]  like that may survive because there's very little water in the desert, and the sands will  cover up most objects, and so when future people dig them up, they'll find these gigantic  pyramids again.  Well, do you think more than say something like cut diamond, because the diamond itself  was natural, but the cut proves that people were here or something, how long would a cut  diamond last?  Oh, that would last for a long time.  If you now talk about geologic structures, they could not last even longer. 
[02:09:30]  They could last for hundreds of thousands to millions of years, okay?  But if you talk about man-made structures, structures like houses, buildings, you know,  automobiles, and things that we can see and touch, those things will probably disintegrate  pretty rapidly within a few centuries to a few thousand years.  Sure.  But, and again, water, erosion are some of the main enemies, so in the desert, you don't  have that problem.  How about, Anna had said possibly stuff on the moon, like... 
[02:10:00]  I said that too, Jimmy.  I said lunar junk.  Okay, I didn't agree because I thought that something would hit it, or how long do you  think, like, the evidence that we were on the moon will be up there?  Well, just go with the flag that's up there.  Well, yeah, all right.  Actually, on the scale of hundreds of millions to billions of years, most of the craters date  back to the age of meteors, three and a half billion to four and a half billion years  on the moon, and so the erosion that takes place is extremely slow.  There is a slight amount of erosion on the moon, but over billions of years, and so those 
[02:10:30]  footprints would be there for hundreds of millions to billions of years from now.  Wow.  Okay, so the stuff that's on the moon now, and there's no way that dust or dirt will  blow over it because there's no atmosphere?  No way.  The only way that it would erode is if they have meteor impact, and that's why the surface  of the moon is dusty, because of meteors that collided with the moon and created debris and  dust.  And so the moon is not perfectly pristine, like you might think, because there's a small  amount of erosion going on. 
[02:11:00]  But structures on the moon, the craters, they date back three and a half billion years.  So, like, the base of the lunar module, the lunar rover, things like that will be there  for many, many years.  Yeah, long past most structures on the Earth have been grown over with vegetation and eroded  with water and rust.  Structures on the moon, just like the desert, where there's very little water, the moon has  almost no water, and so structures like that will last an awful long time, because it's  water and erosion that are the main enemies of structures. 
[02:11:30]  And how about something like, we talked about, like, the Voyager 1 spacecraft that had been  sent out.  How long do you give that, or do you think that will eventually just crash into something?  Well, eventually it will crash into something, but not for quite a while.  It takes about 70,000 years for a spacecraft from Earth to reach just like the nearest star.  And so that thing's going at, you know, roughly 40,000 miles an hour.  And so it'll take many thousands of years before it bumps into anything. 
[02:12:00]  Yeah, there's nothing in the way.  It's just pretty much a void vacuum.  Yeah.  And we talked about radio waves, and one of our guys said that radio waves die after a  certain time.  How far will radio waves travel where they could possibly be picked up by somebody who  is listening or has the ability to listen?  Well, they'll go on forever.  However, the intensity goes down, of course, as the inverse square.  So the farther you go out, the more they diminish.  But in principle, the Oppie and Anthony show will go out forever throughout the universe. 
[02:12:30]  He loves playing.  But does it just become, because our guy, Danny, who does kind of have a basic physics  understanding, I don't know how, because he's dropped out of third grade.  I was under the impression that TV and radio waves degrade to static over the course of one  to two light years.  Well, they will gradually interfere with other things because of random collisions and stuff  like that.  Ultimately, they go down to like three degrees above absolute zero.  That's a temperature of out of space. 
[02:13:00]  So ultimately, all communications will degrade down to three degrees above absolute zero,  which is, of course, the static of out of space.  When you turn on your radio and you are in between stations and you get static, a few percent  of that static comes from the Big Bang, the creation of the universe.  So you're actually listening to Genesis when you hear the static on the radio.  Genesis?  What's that?  It's a band.  They were a great band.  That was from Rathacon, by the way.  A lot of the static you have on the radio comes from the planet Jupiter. 
[02:13:30]  And some of it does come from the Big Bang, the original Big Bang, 13.7 billion years ago.  Now, if it degrades to three degrees above zero, which was actually what I said, that  it would degrade to three degrees above absolute zero, can someone pick that up as a communication  or decipher what's being said?  If they're very good at it, they can find regularities.  Right now, the three-degree radiation, which is everywhere, it's inside your body, it's  inside your living room, it's inside outer space. 
[02:14:00]  It's all random, static.  But an intelligent species might be able to pick out regular patterns, like verbal communication.  Like this chat that we're having right now is being beamed into outer space.  So let's say 10, 20 light years down the road, some other intelligence is picking this up.  I mean, they're not hearing what's actually happening right now.  They're just hearing patterns of static, correct?  Well, there'll be some messages that you'll be able to hear even beyond that.  There'll be some messages that survive.  However, a large amount of it will be degraded with time. 
[02:14:30]  As long as our penthouse reads.  But, again, we are touching it out by enormous distances from the planet Earth.  But, yeah, eventually it will degrade.  So, okay, so our guy Danny the Fool was incorrect when he said that apparently radio waves die before  they get to Schenectady.  It was my understanding that they don't really make it past two light years.  I will have to do the calculation.  It depends on the intensity of the wattage. 
[02:15:00]  Like a good radio station will broadcast at 50,000 watts.  Yeah.  And a good 50,000 watt signal should survive even past that point.  Because we are scanning for stars.  We're scanning for very faint signals from, you know, planets in outer space that are more than two light years.  And we expect some of their TV and radio emissions to reach the Earth.  And we do communicate with satellites that are very far away from us with radio signals.  Yeah, but only like 20,000 miles.  Geosynchronous satellites are only about 20,000 miles. 
[02:15:30]  Well, that's what I mean.  But still, commands have to be sent out to, like, the Mars landers and things like that.  Yeah, but the Mars landers are about 20 minutes away by radar and by radio.  So, to send a round-trip signal to the Mars lander and back would be about 40 minutes.  Oh, that's nice.  As opposed to, right, because radio waves travel at the speed of light.  So, it'll basically take light 40 minutes to travel that distance.  Am I correct?  Yeah, 20 minutes to get to Mars and another 20 minutes to get back. 
[02:16:00]  Dr. Kaku, I got a question.  What about rubber dicks?  That came up in our, no, that really did come up in our discussion.  Some people are convinced that would be the last thing that would survive on Earth.  Well, I think, like I said, I think don't degrade much earlier.  Anything that's in the city that encounters erosion will be basically overgrown by plants, vegetation, animals for 200 years.  Right.  And then within a few thousand years, just the rust and the lack of maintenance, a lot of buildings will start to collapse. 
[02:16:30]  Sure.  Even in Manhattan, you know, after about 100 years, buildings in Lower East Side collapse all by themselves.  Yeah, yeah.  So, just the faint vibrations of the subway cars is enough to collapse buildings in Manhattan.  How about stuff like somewhere to the Statue of Liberty base, which is like concrete but not that high, where it wouldn't just like fall?  I mean, that got a couple hundred thousand years in it?  Yeah.  I think that the Statue of Liberty is not going to last that long on a scale of just, you know, centuries.  We all saw Planet of the Apes, right? 
[02:17:00]  Right.  We're all shocked when Justin saw the Statue of Liberty sitting in the ocean, right?  That's actually a credible scenario because, again, erosion, lack of maintenance, the overgrowth of algae and different kinds of organisms growing on the skin.  And a visit from Wendy Williams.  Structure.  Exactly.  Yeah.  So, what was that again?  Yeah.  No, that's exactly what we were discussing.  Yeah.  Well, Dr. Kaku couldn't have been happier. 
[02:17:30]  This is the guy we needed to talk to, guys.  Yeah, we got to the bottom of this.  Finally.  So, the pyramids would pretty much be the last structure on Earth.  Structure.  Dry.  And the moon thing would definitely be the last thing ever.  You guys were right.  Yeah.  Very nice.  And Danny was incorrect about his radio wave signals.  Yes.  Which, Danny said that they did a contest and baseballs could be thrown almost the distance that radio waves travel.  Yeah.  So, Danny's a blithering idiot.  The good Dr. Kaku did say that he would need to do some calculations.  Yes, but he said that, as I once said, three degrees above absolute zero. 
[02:18:00]  I'm sorry to have to involve you in this argument.  I said three degrees above absolute zero and Danny said cookies.  Yeah.  As long as some alien race might at some point pick up our liquid ass commercials.  That would be wonderful.  Then I'm happy about that.  Well, thank you very much, Dr. Kaku.  I want to ask the good doctor because, you know, we're both math whizzes.  Dr. Kaku, do you laugh at Sudoku like I do?  I laugh at this thing.  How easy is Sudoku?  I'm very careful not to do it because I know it's highly addictive.  I know friends of mine, I can't get away from it. 
[02:18:30]  Wow.  So, I very carefully stick away from it because I don't want to get addicted.  Look at that.  How is the string theory coming?  How great would it be if Dr. Kaku got addicted to Sudoku instead of figuring out the universe?  Stays in his house.  People are trying to call him for answers and he's just like, no.  He's the only man that could figure out the universe and he's too busy with his Sudoku addiction.  October is when they turn on the Large Cajon Collider again and we string theorists are looking very much forward to that. 
[02:19:00]  We hope to pick up perhaps sparticles, the next vibrations of the string, with the Large Cajon Collider.  So, watch for it.  In just a few more months, the biggest machine on Earth is going to be turned on.  17 miles in circumference.  What happened?  You turned it on.  I don't know what happened to it.  And why don't they turn it on now?  Well, 50 magnets got damaged because they spilled tons of liquid helium on the floor.  Oh, that's good.  And they're turning on the world's largest machine and they can't even figure out the magnet problem.  Wait, who spills tons of liquid helium? 
[02:19:30]  What, did somebody bump into the wrong cup?  How does that happen?  I know he was crying over it.  Was someone reaching for their coffee cup?  Yes, sir?  Yeah, they rushed the turning on of the accelerator last year and human error led to the spilling of tons of liquid helium onto the floor.  It was so cold the workers could not get down there or else it would freeze to death.  That's how cold it was.  Yeah, wow.  And then they had to shut it down over Christmas because it consumed so much energy.  Geneva would have no electricity for Christmas.  They actually share electricity over Christmas. 
[02:20:00]  Oh, great.  So they had to shut it down during the winter months.  The big storage machine, yeah.  That's how we not turn the big machine on.  No, do it.  It doesn't sound like we're ready for the big machine.  Yeah, well, come October, finally everything's going to be in place.  And they'll crank it up and go to full power perhaps early next year.  Jeez, that's unbelievable.  All right.  Dr. Kaku, thank you so much for helping us out today.  What are you plugging today?  Well, I'm filming with the Science Channel.  I'm in a limousine going to a filming with the Science Channel. 
[02:20:30]  They're filming my entire book, Physics of the Impossible.  Oh.  Which is going to air in the Science Channel in November.  So we're going to have programs on starships, warp drive, time travel, parallel universes,  anti-matter, teleportation, invisibility.  You name it, it's going to be on the Science Channel.  And I'll be posting it starting November of this year.  Oh, that's exciting.  Very good.  Very good, Dr. Kaku.  Thank you so much.  We'll talk to you again soon.  Thank you, sir.  Okay.  Take care.  All right.  Dr. Kaku. 
[02:21:00]  So you guys were right.  The moon stuff.  I stand corrected.  Moon stuff.  And pyramid.  Sounds like the answer from...  And I still stand behind my usable signal strength for radio and television.  Oh, yes.  Just call Dr. Kaku, you know.  He said calculations.  He's that bad.  He doesn't have...  Where's Dr. Steve?  Dr. Steve hates Dr. Kaku.  Does he?  He tries to be...  I love it.  Every time Dr. Kaku's on, Dr. Steve sends me these awful things.  He doesn't know shit.  Dr. Steve's hysterical. 
[02:21:30]  Dr. Steve's a psycho.  That's great, though.  Two doctors battling it out.  Dr. Steve.  I have faith in Dr. Steve.  I've never seen Dr. Kaku shove a finger in a homeless man's asphalt before.  You've never seen Dr. Kaku run the building, then?  That's all he does.  The doorman.  At least when we call Dr. Kaku, he's wide awake and he's being productive.  When we get Dr. Steve on the phone, what?  I just woke up.  What?  And then you get emails later on.  Was that good on the radio this morning?  Because I don't even remember what I said.  Well, that's great because people are following your advice.  Sorry, I was picking crank out of my mustache. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  I bet Dr. Kaku doesn't have time to make his own wine.  Exactly.  He's busy with an accelerator somewhere.  Exactly.  Dr. Steve is drunk in the basement with purple shit on his toes and rotten raisins and grapes  caught in his toenails.  Trying to criticize the great Dr. Kaku with his fucking smart slacks rolled up.  Holy shit.  He wakes up every morning and peeks out that front door hoping that he's not being called  a fraud.  Thank God they haven't found me out yet. 
[02:22:30]  It's just a matter of time.  Come on.  What is this, Dr. Steve?  Oh, no.  Dr. Steve rules.  Fucking Dr. Steve.  Dr. Steve?  Yeah.  Hi, Dr. Steve.  Hello, Steve.  Hi, sir.  You weren't just listening to the radio, were you?  I was just feeding my kids.  Sorry.  I totally messed up.  Dr. Kaku's not feeding his kids.  We were talking.  We had Dr. Kaku on and we were just on the radio, on the phone.  Jimmy seems to have led us all on to the fact that you do not agree with Dr. Kaku many 
[02:23:00]  times.  That's right.  I'm his name.  Shut up.  Well, Danny said that radio waves kind of disintegrate or degenerate badly after two  light years.  And so we asked Dr. Kaku and he said they probably go much farther than that.  They degenerate to three degrees above absolute zero.  Well, how do you feel?  Yeah, no, he's right about that.  See, Danny is wrong. 
[02:23:30]  I think what the argument really was, was that, I mean, you know, this radio show going  out, I mean, if someone's 100 light years away, in 100 years, they're not hearing  our words.  Right.  They will hear us do a liquid ass commercial.  It's just going to be just white noise, brown noise, whatever you want to call it.  And there's not going to be any distinguishable data.  It's on the station.  Well, this show particularly, you know, is on 2.5 gigahertz or whatever.  Although it would propagate through space pretty well, it's basically beamed at Earth. 
[02:24:00]  Well, I mean, let's just call it a regular radio station, an average radio station in  the country.  The, you know, the signal is going to degenerate to such a point where it's going to be, you  would be unable to extract intelligent code or data.  With our technology, maybe.  But I mean, somebody advanced up to pick it up.  Yeah, they'll decide for that shit.  Just like anything else, if you've got a shitty fucking antenna on top of your TV, it's not  going to work as good as a good antenna on your roof, or it's not going to work as good 
[02:24:30]  as a satellite dish.  But I think it's unfair to say that radio waves will just travel forever in space.  That's just a blanket statement like that.  I think that's irresponsible.  Why are we talking about this when we have Dr. Steve on the phone?  I want to ask him about his wine.  Oh.  How's the latest batch of wine coming?  Yeah, it's great, man.  I'm getting ready.  It's almost ready to send off.  I do have a little room left in my wine cellar for some Dr. Steve wine.  Yeah.  His wine will be in there until someone brings over a really nice bottle, because I do the 
[02:25:00]  same thing.  Then I go, wow, I've got to get rid of a bottle of wine from my wine fridge.  It's half stocked, by the way, right now.  Really?  Just about half stocked.  Dr. Steve doesn't have a year on his.  He has a day and actually a time.  Oh, this is the Tuesday 420 brand.  This is very good.  Wow.  Oh, this was aged through a Jefferson's marathon.  The last batch I sent up a little bit too early, so I'm just letting this stuff around.  Oh, you think?  Too early.  There were grapes floating in it.  Yeah, really?  There was grapes just at Welch's on the side. 
[02:25:30]  Exactly.  Oh, Dr. Steve.  Yeah.  Let me say something to Danny about this radio wave.  Oh, yeah.  Go back to that.  Yes.  Go get him.  Sorry, but he made a point.  I just want to rebut it a little bit.  They have a satellite out there called COBE.  Right.  And what it did was measure microwave radiation that was emitted at the time just after the Big Bang.  And those are radio waves that have been traveling to us since the beginning of the universe. 
[02:26:00]  And it was real sensitive and was able to pick up very small variations in this microwave background radiation.  Now, I think that especially if someone is, let's say, 50 light years away from us right now, the signals from 50 years ago are going to be a lot sparser than they are now.  Of course, right now we're blanketing the globe with static, but someone had a sensitive enough receiver and they were advanced enough they could pull out that and at least tell that there is life, intelligent life out there. 
[02:26:30]  Right, that it wasn't just some naturally occurring static from maybe a star or something else, that it was made by another intelligent being.  Right. And the hallmark of a radio signal made by humans is it has a carrier wave, and static doesn't have that.  So I think that they would definitely be able to pick up on intelligence. 
[02:27:00]  But it would be like the sound in contact with Jody Farr.  Like it wouldn't be like just words and signals and stuff.  I mean, it would just basically be noise, and you'd have to be looking for that noise and have some kind of instrument that would be able to decipher.  Well, yeah, but say somebody 10,000 years in advance from us.  It's called a radio receiver, my friend.  Oh, shit.  Dr. Ross, humiliated. 
[02:27:30]  Just make fun of his wine, and you'll be back in the game.  If you listen to the whole of the radio spectrum, it's just a complete mess.  But what you do with the receiver is you drill in on that one frequency that you want to listen to.  I think it's doable. I really do.  Yeah, I do, too.  All right, Dr. Steve.  It's like Dr. Ross isn't concurring.  Dr. Ross was humiliated.  He does not concur.  Yes.  According to Daniel Ross, that radio waves typically die before they hit the clouds.  So basically, planes are using carrier pigeons. 
[02:28:00]  Danny doesn't think that radio waves can make it through heaven.  I'm saying it's an unusable system.  But won't God interpret them and listen to them?  I'm not saying that they don't exist, but they would be completely unusable beyond a certain point.  Well, to our technology, maybe.  Yeah, perhaps.  And let's not forget where the argument was in the first place.  It was what kind of evidence will there be of mankind when it is gone?  Right.  So, you know, 50, let's say, you know, 50 light years away, will anybody be able to detect the presence of human intelligence if there is none here anymore? 
[02:28:30]  Yeah.  Yes.  From radio, from degraded radio waves.  Yeah, absolutely.  All right.  All right.  I had one more.  Oh, God, no.  Oh, a question?  Oh, would a KROQ signal go farther since there are apparently no ears to interfere?  All right, Dr. Steve, it's a pleasure.  Dr. Steve, thank you so much.  Thank you, buddy.  Thank you, my friend.  And hopefully we see you when you get your ass up here. 
[02:29:00]  October 17th, we're definitely coming up.  And I've got a new bet to hopefully we'll top the Tippi Tom prostate exam.  Are you serious?  Can you tell us what that bit is?  Do you really want me to tell you now?  Absolutely.  That'll be a great tease for your show.  Well, um.  Oh, no, you didn't, man.  Oh, oh, B.  Oh, Christ. 
[02:29:30]  I didn't even see that one coming, and I see it coming all the time.  Poor Dr. Steve.  Oh, poor Dr. Steve.  He's a lifesaver.  Dr. Steve.  We treat him like shit.  He is great.  Hey, uh, Wendy Williams.  We can't get enough.  During that entire conversation, me and Opie were looking at the TV, then turning to each  other and making disgusted faces, and then looking back at the TV.  She was trying to look extra sexy and extra pouty.  She was pouting and then throwing her hair around and moving her shoulders and trying hard-derndest 
[02:30:00]  to look hot.  But on the red carpet, that thing?  Yeah, but you see her waist was small.  Her ass was kind of big and juicy, and her tits are huge.  No, no, no.  I'm not saying she's the hottest thing ever, but...  Hottest thing ever.  I mean, like, I'm not saying, like...  I'm not saying I lost her completely, but I'm saying, like, would I fuck her?  Yeah.  Absolutely.  Would your weenie get hard?  Oh, yeah.  Never.  Please.  That big weenie just gently rubbed it on me?  Yeah.  My weenie, and believe me, I get hard fucking drop of a hat. 
[02:30:30]  Drop your hat.  Watch.  That's right.  You get hard at the drop of a Zoom box set.  Zoom.  I know.  I'm gonna Zoom-a-Zoom-a-Zoom-a-Zoom.  I love that song.  Zoom-a-Zoom-a-Zoom-a-Zoom-a-Zoom-a-Zoom-a-Zoom.  But I don't think I could even fucking get it up for the likes of a Wendy Williams.  She would suck that fucking dick.  Oh, stop it.  With that man's head. 
[02:31:00]  Those long nails scraping your balls.  All of a sudden, you look down.  I'm telling you.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  You feel a razor stubble?  Oh, believe me.  I can't argue with that.  Wendy Williams is a monster.  We're still Googling that.  Yes.  Google that.  It's got to be number one.  Wendy Williams is a monster.  So far, we're not in the top 100.  I just got a report.  I got a text from Steve.  Ha ha.  I can't believe I fell for that, you fuckers.  Yeah.  Ah, yeah.  There it is.  Steve, call back.  I want to hear the idea.  You never know. 
[02:31:30]  Try the wine.  These guys are horrible.  I'm glad to see you appreciate five-minute-old wine.  Ha ha.  Have another paper cup.  He serves it in Dixie cups.  Of course he does.  Read the comic on the side.  It's wonderful.  He has the Bazooka Joe of wine.  Yeah, there's like a little funny caption on the back of every label.  Makes it worthwhile.  Yeah.  He scotch tapes the labels on fucking mason jars. 
[02:32:00]  Bazooka gum.  Worst gum ever.  Bazooka?  I fucking hate Bazooka.  Go fuck yourself.  Bazooka Joe was great.  No, Bazooka was great.  Better than Yum Yum?  Yum Yum.  Or whatever the fuck it was called.  I like Razzles.  Hubba Bubba or Bubble Yum?  Bubble Yum, yeah.  Bubble Yum and Hubba Bubba came out after Bazooka Joe had been out for a while.  I'm just having a gum contest right now.  Now, I would-  Bazooka Joe blows.  Bazooka Joe gum was very good as I was growing up.  As it breaks your teeth.  Until the flavor degrades. 
[02:32:30]  How about you make your-  Yes.  Yes.  The flavor degrades after-  How about you make your gum soft?  Yes.  I talked to Steve.  I talked for a good minute before I realized I'd been hung up on-  Oh, no.  Oh, bro.  How embarrassing.  That's fucking hilarious.  And he probably thought he had the whole room captivated because it was just quiet.  Silence.  Wait, we're getting somewhere with Google.  Type in Wendy-  Oh, that's terrible.  When you type Wendy in Google, Wendy Williams is a monster pops in.  Oh, really?  Is it getting there?  Is it getting there? 
[02:33:00]  Wendy?  No.  Oh, God.  They lied.  Don't lie to us.  You lie, Peary.  Derek made this for you, Anthony.  Anthony and his Shelby.  That's all I know right now.  And now, the Opie and Anthony Show presents an auditory adventure into the private life of  a famous radio personality.  Starring Anthony Cumia and his Super Snake Shelby GT500. 
[02:33:30]  I'm driving home yesterday, and I'm hearing, like, and usually when I step on the gas,  what you hear is the supercharger more than the exhaust.  So now I can't even hear the supercharger because the exhaust is just like, real loud.  It's like, what the fuck?  So I pull over into a P.C. Richards parking lot, which is empty because it's, you know,  pretty late on a Sunday. 
[02:34:00]  And I peek underneath, and I see one of my exhaust pipes hanging down, dragging on the  ground.  And I'm like, you gotta be shitting me.  So here I am with a hanger rigging my goddamn car that costs a lot of money and a lot of  time.  And I'm driving it around like a, with a goddamn hanger holding up my exhaust pipe.  I got home and called up Cameron at Shelby and left a voicemail that was laden with curses. 
[02:34:30]  What do you think?  I'm fucking 20 years old in my Nova that I gotta, I gotta, uh, put, use a hanger and  wire up a goddamn, uh, uh, exhaust pipe on, on a car that costs me a lot of money and  a lot of time.  And, and, and I'm driving around like a fucking, cause I got a, a piece of goddamn hanger holding  up my exhaust.  Here he is in his Mustang with his exhaust pipe falling down. 
[02:35:00]  He's fixing it with a hanger that costs more than a quarter.  No wire hangers ever.  It's another case of pure American incompetence.  This has been an auditory adventure into the private life of a famous radio personality.  Brought to you by the Opie and Anthony show.  Right on.  I like that.  Makes me sound crazy.  I like that one.  Makes me sound like a lunatic. 
[02:35:30]  Uh, baseball card gum.  Yeah.  Um.  End of fucking question.  Like baseball card gum.  The staler, the better.  Wait, you liked it?  The staler, the better.  Yeah, it was good for 30 seconds.  You chew it, it breaks into 80 pieces.  Chew a glass.  Sugar glass.  And those 80 pieces don't know how to make it into one.  Yeah.  I had a piece of that recently.  Like, uh.  Oh, it's the worst.  They have some vending machines where you can get like these classic packs of old school baseball  baseball cards and they're legitimately, you know, 20, 25 years old and they still have  gum.  Get out of here, you ate 25 year old gum. 
[02:36:00]  It's not bad.  25 year old gum.  Yeah.  That's pretty cool.  It still holds up.  Gum.  Gum.  Oh, oh.  Yo, excuse me.  Yes.  I thought that, I thought you were talking about delicacies.  Wow.  I mean, you have to try, you open it up, there's a piece of ancient gum.  You kind of wonder if it's still good.  And you were able to chew it into a.  It's so brittle.  I mean, like, Jimmy, I mean, when it was new, it broke apart into a thousand pieces.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[02:36:30]  It's pretty much the same.  And it would have that powdery shit all over it.  Joe Torrey gum.  It's like a Joe Torrey car, but as a player, Joe Torrey gum.  Faggot I am.  All-star game tonight.  Who's watching?  Ugh.  No.  Why would I bother?  Big Buddy.  You ever have a Big Buddy?  Oh, Big Buddy.  Yeah.  What's going on he's checking in with?  Big Buddy.  Those are those giant sticks of.  Those giant sticks of what amounted to Bazooka Joe bubble gum.  What about a big league chew?  Big league chew.  Let's go. 
[02:37:00]  That was fun.  It was like you're chewing tobacco.  Yeah.  But it was gum like shredded gum.  How great is this?  Josh and Jersey.  I hope Dr. Steve ends up like grape stomp lady.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  I always wanted to swallow the gum, the chewing gum.  Why?  I don't know.  There was just this urge I had when I was chewing gum.  I always wanted to swallow it, but I did a couple of times, and then it made it hard 
[02:37:30]  to make poopy because it gums up the works.  No shit it does.  It gummed up the works.  That's fucked up.  That was when I was a kid.  Then I realized, spit that gum out.  Gum.  All right.  Are we really talking about what gum is the best?  What's wrong with us?  No.  We're shocked.  No.  South Park doing the Michael Jackson thing.  We'll take a look at that.  Michael.  Obama.  Bubble tape. 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, that was good.  Oh, bubble tape was good.  Bubble tape was good.  Yes.  What else?  We might have to play.  I used to leave a little trail of bubble tape from the junior high to my car trunk.  Watch them just gobble it up as they get in the trunk.  Do you know what's good gum, by the way?  Yeah.  Did you ever have lima gum?  Tastes like lima beans.  That sounds delish.  It's really good.  Danny.  Have some gum.  Find the top ten gums of all time.  Freshen up. 
[02:38:30]  You are the king of the internet, so.  Freshen up was called cum gum.  Yeah.  That was the stuff in the middle.  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, when it gave you a nice little fresh squirt.  Yeah, and it would burst.  It would squirt in your mouth.  Yeah.  Mmm.  That Fruit Stripe gum flavor lasted when you unwrapped it.  The flavor went away.  It said, do not expose to air.  That was the worst.  Yeah, Fruit Stripe was really good for eight seconds.  Like Wrigley's.  I love fucking, what were the three Wrigley's flavors?  The yellow, Juicy Fruit, Spearmint, and what was the other one? 
[02:39:00]  Peppermint.  All amazing for a minute and a half until the sugar wore off.  Juicy Fruit was just, I would sit there and just keep putting sticks of Juicy Fruit in your mouth.  And then the flavor would run out and I'd have no money because I was a kid.  As long as McMurphy kept handing them to me, I'd eat them.  My favorite gum?  My favorite gum of all time?  Yes.  The street gum I ate the other day.  Ah.  Oh, it was just terrific.  Gave you the shits for a week.  It's Hepsy Fruit.  It did give me the shits for like two or three days.  The watery, the watery goodness that is a liquid shit. 
[02:39:30]  Steven S. from Bayshore, Danny ate 25-year-old gum and won't even kiss anything that old.  Ah, I get it.  You bastard.  All right, quick break.  Certainly.  Danny's going to find the top 10 gums of all time.  I'm sure Big Red's in there, but Big Red was like lava.  That burnt the tip of your tongue.  They made it too hot.  Yeah, they really ruined it.  They really didn't have like...  It's like dentine, but...  They didn't have anyone in the factory that was testing the gum. 
[02:40:00]  They're like, ah, fuck.  Big Red hurt.  Yes.  Big Red hurt to chew that shit.  That's true.  What was the one?  Remember the Big Red's kiss a little longer, hug a little longer, say goodbye a little longer  with Big Red?  Longer with Big Red.  How many ideas do you think got scrapped?  Like, look, that's a great song, but you can't say rape a little longer.  They don't want that.  Take a diarrhea shit a little longer is not acceptable.  Those are the scribbled out ones on the page.  Exactly.  Molest a kid a little longer. 
[02:40:30]  It does flow, yes, but it's not appropriate.  It's below kiss with a line through it.  Commit hate crimes a little longer.  It sounds too good.  We have to go with that.  The jingle writer was brilliant, but he was just twisted.  So he had to, like, fish through all his bad ones.  Right.  Just to find the real good ones.  Kiss a little longer, good.  Cut your wrists a little longer, no.  No, no, we can't do that one, sir.  I'm sorry.  Big Red.  Big Red also had that hillbilly one.  It was like, the truck driver chewed the gum cold Big Red with a bold, clean bite and 
[02:41:00]  a big, strong flavor that's bound to treat you right Big Red.  I don't remember that one.  Jesus.  We stopped.  Jesus.  Sorry.  I just have commercials in my head all day long.  It never goes away.  I don't remember that one.  It never goes away.  They play endlessly in a loop in my brain.  Best song in a commercial ever.  Let's never discuss that.  That's a subject we will never, ever discuss.  Never. 
[02:41:30]  I say the Coca-Cola by the world of Coke.  That's my opinion.  Coke that like to teach the world to sing.  Yeah.  Faggot.  Why am I a faggot?  Because I happen to like a bunch of hippies with candles.  I wanted to learn to sing.  Thank you.  They went to teach the world singing.  Perfect harmony.  Perfect harmony.  Ugh.  That's true.  We stumped Danny.  He can't find the top ten gums of all time.  Nope.  Wow.  Holy shit.  I could find people's opinions.  Like yours on Radio Wave Travel?  Exactly.  Apparently, yeah.  He said calculations would need to be made.  Well, yeah, sure. 
[02:42:00]  Danny will go to his lab and start calculating.  Exactly.  I actually have to, we have to calculate a new keg into my fucking bar today.  Ran out of Bud Light.  Uh-oh.  Ouch.  And the Guinness one's getting a little light and my ice maker is broken.  Jesus.  How much beer are you guys drinking?  Holy shit.  A lot of fucking beer.  Kegs and kegs.  Kegs of beer.  You're not having massive parties.  It's mostly you two.  I know.  The guy that delivers it laughs at us.  The guy that delivers the kegs laughs now when he comes down.  Oh, yeah.  He just starts laughing. 
[02:42:30]  I remember when I was there for a delivery one day, and I just felt like messing with  the guy.  That means there were many deliveries.  Oh, yeah.  A bunch of deliveries.  I was there for one of the deliveries one day.  Hell yeah.  I was just like, oh, you think he drinks a lot of beer, huh?  And the guy was just like, yeah.  And all those guys are alcoholics by nature.  Oh, yeah.  Just brought it down.  Oh, the beer guys are the best guys to party with.  Fuck.  I got a Guinness keg sitting on the Ready 5.  It's on Ready Reserve waiting to go in.  And then the Bud Light, I think, is coming today. 
[02:43:00]  Nice.  Yeah.  All right.  Break time.  Nice when the new keg rolls in.  Yes.  Take a little break, and then we'll come back and have some more fun.  That's okay, Mike, in North Carolina.  What's going on?  We're just laughing.  What happened?  We're all comparing dicks.  I thought mine was the biggest ants by far was the biggest. 
[02:43:30]  I had to plump it up a little bit.  Yeah.  Not mine, Jim's.  Yeah.  Anthony, he was equal to two bladders, me, and three Dannys.  Couldn't believe it.  Sorry, Dan.  You guys were having a little chit-chat.  You're the smallest weenie.  You guys were having a little chit-chat with the boss.  What was that about?  Just talking about radio.  Regular radio and how fucking awful it is.  And how they're continually trying to change formats to find what works, and none of it's working.  Well, this came from the fact that there's a very strong rumor that our old station in Boston, BCN, you know, because those guys knew better up there. 
[02:44:00]  They're changing formats today.  I don't believe it.  Again.  I think they're fucking around like they were that one day.  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  Yeah.  This seems like the real deal.  $20 that says they're not fooling around.  I think this is the real deal, yo.  And we said the last thing that worked like that, because they're going to like FM Sports.  FM Sports.  It stinks.  Suck a bag of dicks.  Who the fuck wants to listen to that?  This is what happens in radio.  Someone comes up with a brand new format, and it works in some city or town. 
[02:44:30]  Next thing you know, all of radio copies that format thinking it's going to work in their city.  Throwing it in, yeah, 50 cities, one company, they blow up all the stations and do exactly what the one station did, and it fails.  Yeah.  So the new one is FM Sports.  There's a couple cities.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Jesus Christ.  Sorry.  I saw it at the same time you did.  It's like, Jesus.  Oh, Sotomayor?  No. 
[02:45:00]  Jesus.  That's on the other TV, Jimmy.  You're looking at the wrong television, Jim.  Don't make that mistake again.  I called her Hugo from Lost last night.  On red-eye.  It should have got a bigger laugh.  Oh, that is good.  He's got a big laugh here.  That's funny.  Why are you talking to the old broad when you got tits McGillicuddy on your left?  Tits McGillicuddy.  Love that one.  It's the dumbest one ever.  Holy shit.  Oh, and then she just ran away.  Live.  Oh, hello.  Oh, people have been asking me all morning.  I'm opening.  I'll finally, finally. 
[02:45:30]  So anyway, Anthony.  Oh, no.  This FM Sports, they're going to try it in Boston because we are tonight.  But Jimmy.  Oh, that's good news, Jimmy.  Thank you.  So FM Sports.  I didn't hear Jimmy.  You heard him.  We all hear him.  10 o'clock.  What happened?  10 o'clock, really?  Tonight.  Wait, now I need to know what it is.  What is it?  Oh, all of a sudden someone needs to know.  They're re-airing my episode of Xerox tonight at 10 o'clock on IFC because I think it did.  Dude, I fucking.  Why are you screaming at me?  Because language. 
[02:46:00]  I got a nice copy of Xerox to bring home.  I don't know where it is.  Well, tonight on.  DVR it.  IFC, yeah.  All right.  So that's good.  10 o'clock tonight, IFC.  Yeah, it was.  People seem to like it.  And I'm very insecure about my acting.  But I think in this one, it went pretty well.  Considering most of it was improv.  When you bust through the paper and it's Jim the Animal Norton, it's uncontrollable laughter.  Do I look stupid?  Yes.  You look like a jamoke.  But it's good. 
[02:46:30]  But you play good stupid.  Good stupid.  No, it's really funny.  Really funny.  Thank you.  10 o'clock tonight.  So FM sports.  Dude, it's awful.  Who wants to listen to that all day?  No.  So what happens is, yeah, it works in one city.  So they all decide to do it because they're just all lemmings in regular radio.  And I don't know.  I mean, if it's true that BCN is going all sports, they have a powerhouse sports station up there.  That they might even own.  Yeah.  Maybe this whole thing's horseshit. 
[02:47:00]  I think it's horseshit.  The only shot regular radio had was to be, I think, news, you're always going to need a certain amount of that.  And talk because you can't get that on an iPod.  And they fucking cut the balls off of all male talk.  Don't do any Asian impressions.  Yeah.  It was just these fucking, these jizz bags running regular radio.  And that's why it stinks.  Yep.  It's unlistenable.  We were officially the last ones to get kicked out of regular radio.  Anyone else left is just a hack. 
[02:47:30]  Yeah.  A lot of them are.  A couple of them I still like.  Oh, because you have to do their shows.  Not at all.  Yes, part of it.  But no, Touching Rich, I think, are funny, man.  I don't think those guys are hacks.  There's a few guys I think are genuinely funny.  But even them, I think they're one market.  All right.  You guys are doing very well in one market.  EEI is Intercom and BCN is CBS Radio.  So maybe they're setting up for a sports battle.  A little battle up there?  Yep.  Hmm.  Oh.  Q104.3 here in New York City is pushing their website, or this website, like crazy. 
[02:48:00]  SaveYourRadio.org.  Ah, shut up.  No, that's a bad one.  That's where the fucking lawyers are getting involved in trying to get regular radio stations  to pay to play music.  Oh, right, right, right.  And that will put most radio stations out of business.  Yeah, good fuck them.  I guess so.  How about Satellite, though?  Will Satellite be affected by that?  They were already paying ridiculous royalties.  Really?  Yeah.  Satellite pays ridiculous amounts of money for royalties that regular radio doesn't have  to pay.  Why not?  Radio.  They kind of grandfathered in. 
[02:48:30]  Dude, fuck them.  Dude, radio in five years, everyone will be paying for radio.  Yeah.  It's just going that way.  Yep.  It's just going that way.  Whether it's part of your phone bill.  Something.  If you're listening on your phone or online.  Satellite radio.  Or something, yeah.  Your iPhone.  Some kind of subscription.  Whatever, yeah.  Good.  They should have to pay.  Regular radio, they'll figure it out.  I'm telling you.  That's where the whole business is going because the stupid lawyers had to get their grubby  mitts involved.  And advertising is just down the shitter.  I don't really, I'm not a fan of regular radio, but it amazes me what's happening to them where 
[02:49:00]  now the record companies, everything got together and they want all these radio stations  to pay to play their music when playing their music is great marketing for that particular  artist.  That was supposed to be the thing.  That's what amazes me.  The quid pro quo was the deal.  Sure.  The radio station would play your records.  They would get ratings, which they could then turn into revenue through sales.  The record company gets their records played, which makes them popular, which makes people  buy records.  So it was kind of an even-steven thing. 
[02:49:30]  Now they're looking to make them pay to play the records.  I would love to hear the other side of that argument.  I think I might have it.  I think because there's so many venues now that they don't need the fucking radio stations  to play their records to make hits out of them anymore.  So now they could see another revenue stream, which is the stations paying for the fucking  right to play them the record.  It's not the only game in town.  A record company or an artist's YouTube page could realistically put out a single and have 
[02:50:00]  it get huge.  Exactly.  In the olden days, getting a station to play your record was what made or broke your fucking  record.  That was it.  If the station didn't play it, that's why payola was such a huge thing.  They'd go in, these record companies, pay the jock money and go, here's the record,  play it.  The jock would pocket the fucking money and play the record because they knew how important  it was to get radio airplay.  Now radio airplay, it's not important.  Wow.  You just turned me.  Fuck regular radio.  Dude, it's not just that. 
[02:50:30]  Fucking many assholes.  It's also, there's so many ways to copy music now on digital, with like all these AOL  things on the iPhone.  You can just go on there and start grabbing music and digitally copy it from regular radio.  Like 20 years ago, it was a fucking cassette tape.  The record companies just know, though, that it's not the only game in town, so why give  it to them for free?  Right.  Fuck radio.  They're right.  You know, they can make a few more shekels.  Fuck them right in their fart boxes.  They're right.  I agree with the artists on this.  Good.  What about the fart box comment?  You agree with that too?  I do, but I couldn't think of words to say. 
[02:51:00]  I concur.  I just ran out of words.  Nice.  Some of the most viewed YouTube videos of all time is just music.  It's songs.  Yeah.  Like what song?  Avril Lavigne, The Girlfriend.  No.  121 million views.  No, that's not popular.  121 million views.  What's the song, Denny?  On that one.  I just don't know it.  She was the girl, I was going to mention earlier, she's on stage and all sweaty.  I wouldn't mind that at all.  She's a type.  Sweaty Avril Lavigne.  She's definitely a type. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah.  All right.  Hey, you, you.  I don't like your girlfriends.  No way, no way.  Ooh.  This is shitty.  Oh, Mickey, you're so fine.  You're so fine.  You blow my mind.  Hey, Mickey.  What?  Exactly.  I didn't say she was good.  I just said that she was sweaty.  I know that you like me.  No way, no way.  You know it's not to see you.  I like her slutty eyes.  Hey, yeah, yeah.  I want to be your girlfriend.  She's talking to me.  You're so fine.  I want to be so delicious.  Wow, that's Mickey right there. 
[02:52:00]  I know.  Why is every song...  That Tony Basil was on to something, huh?  Yeah.  You know how many songs sound like Mickey?  Don't pretend I think you know I'm damn precious.  What is she...  Why is she doing that whiny voice?  I can tell you like me too, and you know me.  Because it gets 121 million views on YouTube.  All right.  You should ask that to the one that gets 2,100 views.  Not the one that gets 121 million.  Good point.  Why is she doing that enormously successful worldwide popular thing?  I am an asshole. 
[02:52:30]  You're a fool.  You're a fool.  Jesus.  Ask that to the guy with fucking 11 hits.  Oh, God damn.  You're a fool.  And that's not just some guy's YouTube channel that's putting that out.  I mean, that's RCA Records.  That's their YouTube channel is putting that out.  That's pretty cool.  It's a smart thing.  All right.  Then fuck regular radio.  I agree, dude.  The way regular radio has treated the jocks and the artists in the last couple of years  fucking douching everybody.  And it's easy to complain because we got fucking boot.  But so did Steve Dahl.  And he was doing well. 
[02:53:00]  And he didn't like us, who I don't like.  But you know what?  He was successful.  Corolla.  Corolla.  Everyone's getting fucked in regular radio.  Because they couldn't afford the salaries anymore.  And we weren't really asking for that much.  Exactly.  Relatively speaking.  They don't support the talent.  They fucking do nothing but cut your balls off.  They took away everything that made the show fun.  They stink.  Yeah.  Yeah, that did suck.  That was awful.  Their money making, their revenue stream is advertising.  Advertising for regular radio is drying up.  People just aren't. 
[02:53:30]  There's, again, avenues that advertisers are looking at.  And the internet, huge.  You know, we're so distraught.  I think we should go home now.  Really?  I don't disagree, Ope.  I'm a little distraught.  I don't disagree.  I'll tell you the truth.  I'm hurting.  Are you hurting?  Hurdened.  I'm hurting a little bit.  I'm frightened.  Anthony's frightened.  Yeah.  I'm going to hide behind something like blankets.  I'm going to...  A Nazi flag.  Here's blankets.  Blanket hates the light.  Wait a minute.  He's a monster.  I've got to be all scared. 
[02:54:00]  Just one eye looking up.  A little blanket.  Or like this.  No, here.  This is a blanket.  Here.  Do a blanket impression.  There's too much of you being shown.  Okay.  Show me blanket.  It's just one eye.  One little eye.  Help!  My father was a woman and a weirdo.  Help!  I'm Ted the blanket!  You're not Ted.  I'm very shy!  Blanket hates the light.  Let's never forget. 
[02:54:30]  Well, we got a Voss and Bonnie thing.  Voss and Bonnie, it has to be said, they were great yesterday.  How funny is Bonnie, man?  Voss was killing too, but God, she makes me fucking laugh, man.  That fucking broad is funny.  She's hilarious.  She's just funny, man.  She is so sarcastic, and the way she treats Rich is brilliant.  But Voss is also really quick, and he just fucking buried her in something from Target,  and so is her outfit.  Her shitty Target outfit.  They just bash each other.  Yeah, they're good.  They're probably better as friends.  They probably fuck like once every eight months. 
[02:55:00]  Yeah.  I'm going to talk to those two.  They should be divorced.  They should just be buddies.  I think Voss is gay.  Everyone in the room, right?  Do Bonnie, right?  Yes, as far as her being attractive enough, absolutely, but she's my friend's wife, and  I have such a creepy thing.  Yeah.  I can't even jerk off to my friend.  I just, I, eh.  It's, I can't even think about it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But she's pretty enough, certainly.  If she wasn't dating, that bag of shit.  I don't give a shit about Voss at all.  Why don't you just push him out of the way?  I'd fucking, I'd bang Bonnie in a second. 
[02:55:30]  I always knew that.  She pumped the Voss baby out.  What are you doing?  Why'd you take that picture down, Dan?  Put it back up, Dan.  What picture?  What picture?  The picture that was just up there.  Let me see.  We'll take it.  All right.  Holy shit.  Who is that?  Side boob happening.  Side boob on.  What is Emma doing?  That's Emma, right?  Yeah.  We saw the panty malfunction the other day.  No.  What?  Dan, let's see.  Let's see, Dan.  Find it.  How old is she?  This is Emma from, uh.  I think she's like 19.  19.  She's old enough now.  Emma from Harry Potter.  Showing a little side boob.  Emma Thompson?  Harry Potter, yes.  Emma.  Emma Watson. 
[02:56:00]  Oh, Emma Watson.  She fucking emailed me?  Shut up.  All right.  Where is it?  Right.  Know what bit I love?  We were talking about YouTube.  Evolution of the Dance is quite enjoyable.  But also, uh, Jeff Dunham videos.  They're just terrific.  Do they get a lot of views?  Oh, God.  Do they get a lot of views, right?  90 million on his, uh, Achmed the Dead bit?  What?  Thank you, Scott Martin from Japan, of all places, to remind me how god-awful this video 
[02:56:30]  is, and everybody's watching it.  90 million fucking views.  Is it as good as, um, Fred Travolina?  It's right up there.  I fucking love Fred Travolina.  Yeah, what a great loss.  The man of a thousand voice.  Would you like to hear a little-  Would you like to hear Jeff Dunham's bit?  No.  I wouldn't.  I don't think it's Jeff either.  It's not even a visual.  I don't know why it's a YouTube video, because it's not a visual.  All right.  I mean, his puppet is like a, what, like a skeleton as a fucking-  Is it?  As a terrorist.  It's like a terrorist skeleton, and it talks. 
[02:57:00]  Uh-huh.  You haven't seen this video yet?  Oh, whatever.  I don't watch fucking anything.  And then we'll go back to Emma's, uh, Snatch.  Absolutely.  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Come on, come on.  It's right there.  It's so close to finding the U.S.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  All right, open that fucker up.  She can't.  It's a picture.  Oh, she's a side of her underpants.  She's frozen in time, man.  She can't do anything.  That's it right there.  Be great if she was walking, just shitting like a horse.  Like a small pony as she jogged.  Big blocky hash duties are falling out and hitting the back of her ankle. 
[02:57:30]  She's in full trot.  And she has a dope-ly-  A dope-ly.  What's wrong?  Running for her life in a field while she shits.  That's my dream.  It's my nightmare.  But she has a dopey publicist running after her with a shovel and a bucket.  Cleaning it up.  Because there's a big premiere waiting to happen.  Oh, shit.  She's wearing big panties there, isn't she?  No, those are those fucking-  Boy shorts, brother.  Boy shorts.  Oh, okay.  I couldn't tell from this distance.  They're white, too.  Wow.  Their little quiff is all crumped up in them.  We need a girl to tell us exactly what they are.  Oh, shit. 
[02:58:00]  Right?  Thank you, Kenneth.  Thank you, Kenny.  Where's my dildo with marmalade on it if I specifically asked for that?  It's in my pants.  All right, let's go to Jeff Dunham's great video.  I mean, 90 million views.  It's worth a listen.  It's got to be, right?  It's got to be good.  90 million?  Anthony, one of the biggest videos of all time for you, too.  Damn.  Yeah.  Then it's got to be good.  It kills your video that did a solid 3.5 million.  3.5 mil is all I got.  Which one is that?  Is that the 90 million one?  Here we go. 
[02:58:30]  Ahmed the dead terrorist.  Ahmed the dead terrorist.  Here we go, guys.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  See?  It's a skeleton because he's dead.  But he has a turban on it.  Making him look like a terrorist.  Here's Jeff Dunham.  They can't stop laughing.  Good evening, Ahmed.  Good evening. 
[02:59:00]  Infidel.  See?  You're a terrorist.  Yes.  I am a terrorist.  What kind of terrorist?  A terrifying terrorist.  Are you scared?  Are you scared?  Are you scared?  Are you scared?  Let's play a little game called How Long Until We Actually Chuckle?  Because this video is almost a minute in and not one of us have gotten a chuckle yet.  Not a legitimate chuckle?  Right.  48 seconds in. 
[02:59:30]  This bit is 10 minutes long.  We're not going 10 minutes.  Oh, shit.  I like the fact that he's calling him Ahmed, and I like the fact that he has a turban, though.  That I like.  All right.  Where's the laugh, though?  I'm not saying I'm just saying...  Political principle you like.  As a puppet act doing that, yes.  All right.  Here we go.  As a puppet act.  Not really.  No.  And no?  Not really.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No. 
[03:00:00]  No.  No.  No.  Not a bad line.  I mean, uh, Allah, damn it.  Silence!  I kill you!  He is murdering.  So, uh, Ahmed, no, no, is Ahmed.  That's what I said.  No, you said Ahmed.  Is Ahmed? 
[03:00:30]  Silence!  I kill you!  It's not as bad as I want it to be.  No, I know, it's fine.  I'm not laughing, but it's enjoyable.  I guess if you're in the crowd...  How do you spell it?  Is it 90 million views enjoyable?  That's what I'm getting at.  How do you spell your name?  Oh, let's see, uh, A...  C...  Phlegm...  Sing it! 
[03:01:00]  He is fucking destroying...  He is fucking destroying...  That's what they'll throw me on after.  That's what I'd have to follow at a fucking...  At some corporate event.  Yeah.  They'd go, Jeff Dunn just wants to do 10 minutes, and you want me to do 40?  And bury me.  I'd go up and get a zero.  But, Jimmy, you're an expert.  Do the laughs match the material?  It's hard to say.  That's too subjective.  Um, is it my style?  But the whole crowd is losing it over those lines. 
[03:01:30]  Well, like you said, you said, not bad.  That line's not bad.  But these people are losing it like they're seeing, you know, prior back in the day.  I have a different humor, though.  Like, they would probably watch my act and say, atrocious, horrendous, Dakota who?  You know, that's their style.  So, if that's your style...  Well, I mean, look what's the top of the movie box office every week.  You know, with shit like Mall Cop.  I mean, who the fuck's watching that?  People like silly stuff.  You know.  People like silly stuff.  Bruno.  I didn't see it. 
[03:02:00]  Can't tell you.  I ain't watching it now.  Fucking guy blows off our show.  Fuck him.  It's not him.  It's just no way.  No how.  Bruno.  I don't watch the movie now.  Anything rabbit do, Bruno do better.  That's what I'd do.  Mm.  Jesus, this Shakira in a cage.  Oh, she's a singer, right?  Hips don't lie.  Yeah, fucking Pete knows guys have her.  Look at this video of her in a cage.  Holy shit.  What is she doing in a cage?  She has like a bodysuit on.  Oh, she's like a tiger.  She's making the growling face.  She's got a bodysuit on.  She looks naked.  She looks naked in a cage. 
[03:02:30]  All right.  With a little belt or something on.  She-wolf.  They ought to glue a big tuft of hair by her.  A Juan Epstein wig under her underpants.  That'd be fantastic.  Wouldn't that be great?  She's got a big giant bush.  She couldn't even do push-ups properly.  Like her feet and hands wouldn't touch the floor  like she was laying on an exercise ball  with a giant mound of vaginal hair.  It's awful.  What's this?  Terrible is what it is. 
[03:03:00]  Is this her latest song?  She-wolf?  Oh.  Yeah, it's a she-wolf.  Auto-tuning again, right?  This is awful.  I want to dance like a robot to this.  This sucks.  Auto-tuning.  This is what I hear when E-Rock bumbles down the hallway.  Bumble. 
[03:03:30]  Where's that bumbling fool today?  He's horrendous.  Have you seen him?  No.  I haven't seen him.  I've seen him once.  All right.  Let's move on.  Fuck this.  So, Richard-  I want to cave in.  What, what?  The girl's head that does the progressive insurance commercials.  Just how to say that.  Why?  Your lips are so red and juicy.  I just want to cave her head in.  Why?  Why?  Why?  What's wrong with her?  There's something I hate about her.  I just hate her.  Who is she?  That's funny.  There's something I like about her.  Really?  What do you like her, Dan?  You guys want to get your own show. 
[03:04:00]  Call it Agree to Disagree.  Fuck the progressive insurance girl.  Do you?  What's wrong with you?  Her name is Flo.  That's right.  Who is she?  Show some pictures like who she really is.  You don't count, though, Danny.  You jerk off to the Aflac duck.  Anything with insurance gets you a little dick hard.  Yeah, I jerk off to Gilbert Godfrey doing the impression.  The Geico fucking lizard.  Oh, he loves it.  Spanking out.  Anything with insurance, Danny just comes immediately.  It's a hairy caveman.  Danny, look at hand.  It's an all-state camera.  Broar!  Why the fuck?  I think about it jerking me off.  Are you digging her? 
[03:04:30]  You're really digging her?  Dude, I don't know why.  She's doing a little lip scrawl there.  That's kind of...  I just want to fucking bat her over the head like a baby seal.  Who is she?  Comedian?  I think she's Wendy Jo Sperber.  She's dead.  Is she really?  Yeah, she died of the old breast cancer.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Wendy Jo Sperber.  Who's she?  She was in Bosom Buddies.  Bosom Buddies, isn't that...  What a coincidence.  Oh, Jesus.  It's bosom's word, buddies, after all. 
[03:05:00]  But she was also the sister in Back to the Future, by the way.  Thank you.  That was our Wendy Jo Sperber break.  Yes.  Very quick.  Oh, who is she?  Oh, that's her?  Yes.  Stephanie Courtney.  Let me see what else I can find.  See what she looks like without the stupid makeup on, and maybe you'll have something going.  Because I'm looking at that other picture.  She doesn't look as cave-in-able.  Everyone's seen these stupid commercials.  They're everywhere.  No, I haven't seen them. 
[03:05:30]  Everywhere.  Same, like, publicity.  All right, we'll blow it up.  All right, let me see.  Get out of here.  She's very average.  She's not cave-in-able, though.  No, no.  In the commercials, she's cave-in-able.  Oh, guys, Wendy Waves.  Ah, here it is.  Ah, look at her.  Let's see how sassy she gets.  We can't listen to the audio, unfortunately.  Oh, she just waved and she had fucking...  The skin of her arms went flying back and forth.  What?  Look at...  No, look.  What?  Someone from the audience comes up and hugs her? 
[03:06:00]  Is that...  Yeah.  Is that a big thing?  You get to hug a monster.  That's their new bit, hug a monster.  What you don't know about Marlena?  Our connection.  Tell our connection.  You're shaking like a leaf.  Oh, I'm a little nervous.  No, don't be nervous.  This is live.  It's how...  I know.  I know.  Mistakes allowed.  Okay, thank you.  Well, can I tell them that?  Yes, go!  I've been watching you for 10 years.  No, listening.  I just got here.  Well, listening, you're right.  I'm sorry.  It was a nervous part of the audience.  Dummy.  Okay.  Okay, so we'll see you for 10 years.  You both got fat asses? 
[03:06:30]  You know my inspiration through this.  And I'll tell you the rest.  She is 25 years old, Marlena is, and she is in stage 2 breast cancer.  Have a seat, studio, audience.  Oh, shit.  Ah!  Oh, fuck.  Ah!  Did you have a lump?  Tell me you inadvertently hit something.  Or something fell.  I was obviously misdiagnosed.  Boo!  I cut a cold.  I've been going out for three years.  I cut a cold.  I went to the doctor.  Long story short, he diagnosed me. 
[03:07:00]  And staged me at stage 2.  I've already had the limbectomy, and I had two biopsies, and I started chemo in a month.  Ah!  So she's doing all this with a great attitude and four-inch heels.  Yes.  Being more funny.  You've stopped dating for a moment, and you had to leave your job.  Right.  So life is all turned a bit for you, but this is an awareness to everyone then.  You know, you're never too young to start self-checking.  Nice opener.  Right.  And then follow up to the doctor. 
[03:07:30]  Wonderful opener.  How are you going to follow this?  Darling.  Darling.  Go over there and have a seat, Marlena.  Thank you.  And welcome to the show.  Thank you.  Time for hot topics.  You know what?  You know what?  I don't want to know about someone else's fucking problem like that.  Now she goes to hot topics, though.  Hot topics.  All right.  All right.  The monster's sitting down on a chair now.  Well, I thought I would give you a little Stepford Wife today. 
[03:08:00]  She's got oversized furniture to make her smaller.  All right.  You don't want to know where this wig was last night when I got in from partaying.  I had such a great day yesterday.  I'll tell you in a moment where I found it, though, as I scurried around.  In the meantime, here's the big thing.  Her wig?  She's out of breath.  Jessica Simpson thing is affecting me.  I am taking this personally because, first of all, you know that our beautiful country  girl wants nothing more than to have those big, loving arms around her of one man. 
[03:08:30]  She's not, like, slutty, Jessica Simpson.  At least she doesn't portray that.  You know, she's a one-woman kind of man.  I think she rushed that relationship with Tony Romo.  You know, she rushed it along.  Bory.  I guess.  The eve of her 29th birthday, and he breaks up with her.  So she's devastated.  You know, schedule the next day.  My opinion on that is that her go-to girls must have gone and went.  I know Ashley, her sister, is busy with Melrose Place. 
[03:09:00]  And, um, CeCe Cobb is busy with the black guy from Scrubs.  She's been dating him for a while.  I can't think of his face on.  Uh, Donald Face on.  Oh, my God.  They make a cute couple of living together for a while.  Who gives a shit?  That's what our listeners are saying.  That's what our listeners are saying.  My God, this fucking monster.  Eat somebody.  I can point out what might be the issue here.  Yeah?  She's good on the radio.  She's fucking.  But it's when you're at a radio person doing TV. 
[03:09:30]  Yeah.  Sometimes on radio, you have a little more time.  From one cancer to another.  You got to kind of tighten it up for TV.  Point-wise.  She sounds a lot taller on the radio.  But you know what?  Come on the show.  Let's talk about him.  I'm just playing.  Let's talk about what else you're doing besides living and loving.  Another thing.  Is her show just started?  Is this a brand new show?  Or is this?  When's the premiere?  She's so uncomfortable in front of the TV.  She's nervous.  Yeah, she's just.  Her ex-husband.  And so maybe, just maybe, you never know. 
[03:10:00]  Good luck, though.  All right.  So my favorite little sister in the world.  Did I ever tell you this?  I know I just got here.  But for people who've been from the rich.  Solange Knowles.  I love her.  She's my favorite little sister.  Because she defends Beyonce to the end.  So people are getting tired of Beyonce.  And I've been hearing this for quite a while.  I am never tired of Beyonce or Sasha Fierce.  My niece and I were talking about it earlier this morning. 
[03:10:30]  And we both agreed.  We just reviewed the show.  Is that his asshole?  Married.  And she clearly knows how to do separation.  She squarely just pulled his pants down.  And Beyonce is.  Spread his ass cheeks.  And put it right up against the mic.  Juicy farted.  There are a lot of people that don't separate the two.  Like Rihanna.  Sam, what do you got?  Sam, so this is the good stuff that you like listening to.  This is the fucking show.  This is it.  This is on the radio.  This is it.  This is not the radio show.  I don't give a shit.  She's actually, this is. 
[03:11:00]  She did like a two month summer run last summer.  I thought she was on it already.  Okay.  Yeah, they gave her a trial run of eight weeks already.  You are far out of life.  Last summer.  Now that was.  Let me tell you something.  I'm kind of from the school of doing a little visual medium myself.  Let's just leave it at that.  I've heard.  And there's a big difference between doing radio and then doing that.  She ain't doing it.  You got to get to the point a little quicker.  You don't have as much time to kind of meander on TV. 
[03:11:30]  That's all it is.  Yes.  I like to say meander.  I'm not pandering.  I'm just saying, you know, I like you.  All right.  I was a live audience.  Something that's not getting a laugh.  Oh, questions from the audience.  Hopefully they ask monster questions.  The whole gossip thing about Tony and Jessica Simpson.  I think she's just a little bit confused.  And if I was her, I really wouldn't cancel my 29th birthday.  Especially if it's a Barbie thing.  Especially.  How can you cancel your 29th birthday? 
[03:12:00]  What are you, is she going to block the world?  That's another thing.  Thank you for reminding me.  You're welcome.  It was a Barbie can't be.  No, it wasn't a good comment.  She was kind of pushing it hard.  Like, no God.  But still, not all.  Redding wants to know if T.J. Miller is videotaping himself running away from Wendy Williams.  Oh.  Anyway.  Yes.  Hey, Wendy.  How you doing?  How you doing?  I'm Donnie.  He's gay.  I want to talk about the whole Solange thing.  No, he's not.  I'm friends with her on Twitter.  I say he's gay.  And when I was reading it, I was like, what's happening?  But like, when I was reading it, I was like, there's a big dick in your ass. 
[03:12:30]  You're gay.  You know what I'm saying?  And it's like, I know deep down inside, she probably does kind of hate Beyonce because,  you know, Matthew's pushing Beyonce and not her.  But I think we're all getting a little tired of Beyonce.  I mean, like.  Are we?  She's always performing the same stuff all the time.  I bet you are tired of her.  I am not tired of Beyonce.  I mean, she does a big bore to me these days, Wendy.  And I.  No.  No.  No?  Let the cocksucker talk.  And I am also not believing in my heart of hearts that Solange is jealous.  Solange gets all the extra, you know, offspring attention. 
[03:13:00]  Is this right, Sam?  From Jay-Z and Beyonce.  Solange has good music.  Did you listen to her?  I agree with Wendy on that.  Oh, you do?  Yeah.  All right.  Fruit.  Oh, she's shaking.  Her performance on Tyra.  Cute.  Cute.  Anyway.  She goes to the paper.  She's falling out.  She keeps going to the paper.  No, I like her.  On her table.  I like her.  But thank you, though, sir.  I like that oversized furniture to make her look small.  Okay.  Let me tell you.  It's true, though.  All right.  I found the wig. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, where was that wig?  In an empty bag of Doritos.  Wallowing at the bottom of the crumbs last night.  Okay.  Did you really?  Because you know how you go out and you have fun with your friends and whatnot.  And then you come in.  You want a late night snack.  But my late nights are really early.  Late night snack for her is a pig roast.  Yeah.  Wolf down some Doritos.  You know, some water.  Water.  Right.  Or a lamb that's in the neighborhood.  This is my show wig.  Well, one of the many.  When I got home, I had it ringing in my head. 
[03:14:00]  Okay.  We're going to wear this wig throughout the rest of the week.  Through the rest of the week.  Through the rest of the week.  So, I just took it and put it in the bag.  Thinking I was going to grab the bag and bring it.  It had crumbs to read.  I had to shake it out on the lawn this morning.  The whole bit.  Because that's just the kind of girl I am, America.  She's going to laugh.  Yeah.  Come on.  I'm clapping on you.  You don't like her at all, though?  Like, she's kind of just shitty to people.  I don't like her.  I went to the show.  People are watching.  I don't find her entertaining. 
[03:14:30]  I'm grateful and humbled.  And then I leave the show.  She's pretty brutal on celebrities.  Oh, yeah.  What do you call it?  A launch party.  It was for my staff here, as well as the suits.  You know, the suits.  So, we were there.  The drinks were flowing.  The ice sculptures going.  Do we have pictures from that?  I bet she's got to ask.  Celebrity pictures.  Oh, celebrity pictures.  Well, show who showed up.  Jill Zarin.  Oh, Ice-T and Coco.  Gosh, she's sexy.  Look at Coco's dress.  This is the most clothes I've ever seen, my Coco.  And I've been friends with Ice-T and Coco T. 
[03:15:00]  No, I'm enjoying it.  She's been friends with Ice-T and Coco.  Yeah, I call her Coco T.  Since they've been married and since they've been together,  about seven years now.  Can I just tell you, don't be fooled by the huge butt and the boobs.  Vince A from Beyond Doritos.  Doesn't she mean she eats a lost villager?  She's smart.  Trust.  She's smart.  And she's like 30 years old to his 53.  They're just a sexy girl.  Toilet Crusher for Buffalo.  I'll tell you more about...  What channel is this monster from a Bugs Bunny cartoon on? 
[03:15:30]  Monsters are such interesting people.  They're going to come on the show, too, by the way.  Anyway.  Okay.  And Jill Zarin was there.  Who?  New York Housewives.  Look how much weight Jill was.  From New York Housewives.  That's her house on the red carpet.  All the big celebrities came out for her debut.  Her daughter is...  She's got eyes like Limpin' Pool.  You know those Diaz eyes?  You know Cameron Diaz?  Yeah.  You know...  Beautiful.  Beautiful.  She's back to her paper.  Anyway.  Lots of people.  And...  Who else was there?  They showed two fucking... 
[03:16:00]  Lots of people.  She's spur of the moment.  Wendy is spur of the moment.  They showed a D-lister and maybe a B-lister.  Do we have a picture of the oil tanker?  Maybe.  Oh, no.  We don't have that.  Okay.  Sorry.  Ice tea.  Come on.  Hi, girls.  What year is this?  Hello.  Law and order?  Twins?  Yes.  Ugh.  No.  Sad twins.  Give us your wallet, Danny.  Sad twins.  No, no, no.  You think Wendy Williams is envisioning turkey legs right now?  She looks at these still.  Oh, shit.  I love her.  I love her music.  But I'm her friend on Twitter and she tweets a little too much. 
[03:16:30]  A little too much.  Tweety, tweety, tweety, tweet.  I'm in the airport.  Wendy eats a little too much, which is...  I love my son.  Yeah.  A little rhyme.  Husband?  Yeah, it's a little rhyme.  Thank you.  When's the last time you got a tweet?  Tweet.  Whatever.  Two days ago.  She said, my baby daddy, my husband.  I don't know.  She's talking.  I don't know if they're together or not.  No, no, no.  Baby daddy.  She used the word husband.  She said my husband.  Let me get my phone.  She said my husband.  All right.  I'm tapping.  Can we turn it off now? 
[03:17:00]  I'm tapping.  She interacts with her audience.  I'm tapping out.  Can we turn it off now?  No, no, no.  I'm tapping out.  I'm tapping out.  I was tweeting.  I was tweeting.  I don't know.  Yeah, look at that whole shot right there.  They're enjoying it.  Yeah.  My sister.  My sister.  I bring you out of your shells, don't I?  No, no, no.  I'm getting nervous.  I'm having a big mouth vigor.  It's like the tolls are free today, huh, Ant?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Damn.  Just looking at the audience. 
[03:17:30]  I hate the fucking Six Flags commercial.  No one's at the toll booth today.  The old man dancing, I fucking hate.  It's not funny.  It's terrible.  You observe them in line?  When is this show let out?  I want to be out of the city before that happens.  I love the audience on the show.  My co-host.  Can we turn it off now?  Please.  If you're ever in New York and you come on the show, just cut a nice figure and come  on and be ready.  Cut a nice figure.  Yep, yep, yep.  Okay, let me just tell you.  A couple that I don't like, but I like them individually.  She's going to start sucking on her wig to get some Dorito fucking crumbs off of it. 
[03:18:00]  Somebody said, stop this Alex Rodriguez, Kate Hudson thing.  It is not cute.  There they are.  She's driving.  Who keeps it real?  She's hiding.  There they are.  Keeps it real.  Just be an example of that.  Dude, Kate Hudson is a slut.  I hope they're headed towards the fucking Grand Canyon.  What, Dan?  What happened, Dan?  Why did you turn it off?  That was you.  What happened to Wendy?  Haven't you ever?  No, don't agree, audience.  Don't agree.  Do you follow the tabloids and look at the pictures? 
[03:18:30]  Who was the boyfriend, Lorraine, with the rider on the shoulder?  Steven S. from Bayshore writes, Wendy originally wanted her guest to appear on stage in a huge  pot filled with broth and vegetables and a fire lit under it.  Didn't fly with the suits, though, Anne.  It's too bad.  Yeah.  That's ridiculous.  A New York girl.  Or a New Yorkish.  Or something.  A girl with grit.  And Dave B. from Philly.  Her shits are the ticks that fell off the Cloverfield buster. 
[03:19:00]  There was a rumor from Housewives of New York.  Or, you know, just one of them dames.  All right.  Yeah.  Can we turn it off now?  Yes.  All right.  Yes.  I'm done.  That contributed nothing to, like, anything I wanted to know.  I could turn on anything.  A commercial.  A stupid Maury.  A fucking C-SPAN is on with their goddamn bullshit.  It's like, who cares? 
[03:19:30]  You honestly.  I might get something out of it.  I got nothing out of what we just watched and listened to.  You honestly were not thinking about whether or not Solange was jealous of Beyonce?  I don't fucking, I can't tell you how much I don't give a shit about that.  I so don't care.  Beyonce's just achieved so much more as far as singing goes.  Yeah.  Yeah.  More importantly. 
[03:20:00]  Wow.  Do I not care about anything she fucking said?  And more importantly, good news for everybody.  Yeah.  Parking is free today.  Oh, come on.  Because you see.  Yeah.  If you look and then.  Right.  Because.  Yeah.  Similarities.  All Jesus are.  Aw, damn.  So Rich Voss and Bonnie came in and they killed.  And Derek and Steve did a little something with their appearance.  Sometimes the road to a blissful relationship can be bumpy.  A marriage is.  No one's saying that you don't do a lot of stuff. 
[03:20:30]  It's like, it's a business.  It's a machine.  One person's doing the twittering, which is Rich, and the other person is spelling all the words.  It's comedy's most dysfunctional married couple, Voss and Bonnie.  If passion is like a roaring fire, then Voss is peeing all over it.  Is he an affectionate guy?  He, no.  Is he bad with like casual loving touching?  Well, because sometimes he touches you, but it's like a toddler or a monster that doesn't,  like hasn't figured out how to caress. 
[03:21:00]  And why flatter the one you love and the mother of your children when you can shatter her fragile ego?  Right, Rich?  Sometimes he calls my ass Margaret Cho's face.  Wow, Rich.  So if you think your relationship is doomed, look at Voss and Bonnie, and rest a little easier knowing it could be a lot worse.  I remember now what a dick he is.  One time I was blowing him quite well, by the way, and he farted. 
[03:21:30]  And then he gets mad.  That's the best thing I've ever heard of him on the whole thing.  Good job with that, Dirk and Steve.  This guy, very mad at us.  Brian in South Carolina.  Brian.  Hey, guys.  Hey, buddy.  Let me just say, I listen to you guys every day.  I love you guys.  But you guys are so hypocritical sometimes.  You're right, Brian.  I couldn't agree more.  I'm not even talking about you, Jimmy.  Thank you.  What?  Going back to the Jeff Dunham thing.  Going back to the Jeff Dunham thing.  I've heard you guys so many times talking about, oh, this person is too cool for the room. 
[03:22:00]  This person is that too cool for the room.  But you guys do the same thing.  I mean, Jeff Dunham got 90 million hits on his YouTube.  He's found his own little niche.  He's making lots of money.  So who cares?  Brian.  I mean, why do you got to bash him?  And why do you got to do this piece of shit?  Just because I think he's amusing.  Brian, do you like Jeff Dunham?  I watch him on TV.  I don't go searching for him on the internet or anything like that.  Yeah, I don't.  Hold on.  I'm screaming.  I do think he's amusing. 
[03:22:30]  I don't mind Jeff Dunham.  We've had him on the show and stuff.  The point, I guess, we were trying to make, you look at a YouTube video that has 90 million views.  So we took a peek, and I just, I personally don't get it.  I would take a poll that most of our, not most, but a big majority of our listeners don't get it as well.  Hold on, hold on.  And that's why I was asking Jimmy to look inside this a little deeper.  Because, I mean, he was killing on that stage.  But I would, I wouldn't find that funny if I was sitting there.  And Brian, that's all.  I don't think that anybody was being, I don't think Ope or Ant were being too cool for the room. 
[03:23:00]  I think they're both just expressing their opinion.  What did I say, Brian?  I was trying to understand it.  What did I say?  What did I say?  What did I say?  I said, I wanted to hate it a lot more than I did.  I thought the guy, but it's not my cup of tea.  But that's what Ope just said about 90% of your fans wouldn't get it.  That is so politically incorrect.  How could you not think your fans would love it?  I think it's, I think that bit, it's funny. 
[03:23:30]  Because especially if you go and look at how it happened, you know, that bit's from like  90, 2006 or something, not too long after 9-11.  All right?  About five years.  He's bashing suicide bombers.  You know, it's funny.  Okay.  I think it is.  Brian, that's okay.  I'm not trying.  It's okay if you find it funny.  We're not going to find the same things funny, I'm sure.  No, Brian, all I was saying was 90 million views and him killing, I just didn't get it.  That's all?  That's all? 
[03:24:00]  And you explained it.  That's as simple as that.  It's fine.  Well, I just happen to disagree with you.  I mean, it's not just that.  I mean, I've heard you guys do it before.  Bashing on somebody who's got a lot of popularity.  Even if I don't like it, I mean, who cares?  They found their own little niche.  They're making lots of money.  Shut up!  Well, Brian, that's part of what the radio show is.  Thank you, Brian.  Trashing things that we like or don't like or praising things we like.  And Anthony said it wasn't as bad, but what happened?  Well, me and Dan are just looking at Stephanie Courtney, who is the girl from the Progressive 
[03:24:30]  Insurance commercials.  She looks way hotter there, by the way.  She looks really cute.  Yeah.  I don't want to bash her head in now.  And she's wearing a horror movie t-shirt, so Danny goes, I'm in.  The Exorcist.  She's got big boobies, too, Ann.  Look at that.  Can you pop her voice up?  Let's see what she sounds like and what her act is like.  What do you mean, Nick, the one who?  And I'm like, oh, you sure you don't mean Nick or Nick or Nick or Mommy?  Nick or I love Broadway! 
[03:25:00]  Is that from Brian in South Carolina?  We can keep the sound down and just look, because she's kind of cute.  I'm just kidding.  She's got an awesome rest.  I don't know.  She, um...  Yeah.  She...  Right now, I don't want to bash your fucking head in.  That's really coming around.  I was really annoyed.  See, there she is, up on the commercial.  And there she is on the screen.  Wow, that's weird.  See, she looks like a bad diner waitress up there. 
[03:25:30]  But down there, she looks like, you know, kind of a cute...  She looks like a girl...  She looks like an attainable girl.  Like, if I ran into her at a bar...  Yes!  You could so fucking hook up with her.  She was kind of buzzed or something.  I could probably make out with her in the back somewhere.  Dude, so attainable!  Danny, it's like I always say, every girl is attainable if you have a fake cast.  Just make sure it's FH Riley's.  That was exactly what I was thinking.  She is completely attainable.  Can I go back to that, Brian?  Oh, Brian. 
[03:26:00]  I have a question for Jimmy.  Brian, you think Brian from South Carolina, I don't know, likes Jeff Dunham?  I don't think he likes Jeff Dunham.  Really?  It sounded like he...  He loves him!  No, I really don't think he likes him.  Oh.  Sorry.  Instant feedback.  A lot of people saying they didn't get it either.  For the record.  And a couple saying...  He loves him!  Oh, there it is.  I won't allow my bit to be interfered with. 
[03:26:30]  I was going to steal it from Jimmy.  I won't allow anyone to take my thunder and run amok with it.  Is that her in a bikini?  No, I doubt it heavily.  Well, then why was it in her pictures?  I'm sure it's someone else named Stephanie.  Well, why don't you look?  Ugh.  Ugh.  That ain't her.  It's not her.  And she's good.  She's not seahorsie.  She's just...  Some people just take pictures for no fucking reason.  So she also is a very hardworking mother of four.  Susan Smith!  She was hotter than ever. 
[03:27:00]  And blogs all the time on her website, which is called modernmom.com.  Oh, Andrea Yates.  Listen and learn, ladies.  She likes giving baths and calling 911 and attending wakes.  Oh, Brooke.  Who is that?  She's looking good still.  Who is that?  Brooke Burke.  Oh.  She was on Dance with the Stars recently.  Oh, she's a nice rack.  Fake stupid hug.  Oh, you don't like her fucking toga?  No, I kind of like the...  How you doing?  Hey, what is she doing there? 
[03:27:30]  How great would it be if Brooke just leaned over to one side, lifted her leg, and then diarrhea farted?  Like, she's trying to be funny on Wendy's show, and then just sharted through her white dress.  Sharts.  Sharts.  Sharted.  Nothing better than a good shit fart.  All right.  Why don't we move on, Ant?  Blogger Marcy Wheeler says, blowjob on MSNBC.  Ooh.  Marcy Wheeler, is that fucking the gawker chick?  Am I way off? 
[03:28:00]  Or Obama's teleprompter falls down and smashes on the floor during speech.  I think I'm wrong.  Wow, they must have freaked out at that.  Yeah.  Yeah, what did he do?  Thinking perhaps it was, you know.  You know.  Can we do both?  No.  We can do both.  No, you can't, though.  I say blogger first, then Obama.  Blogger, then president.  That's...  All right.  You know, what do you think?  Yeah, that sounds good. 
[03:28:30]  Blogger, then...  I was just looking if somebody was requesting Obama's teleprompter.  Oh, can we go Obama first?  But that's okay.  Which one do you guys want first?  I want blogger, then president.  Blogger?  Blogger.  All right.  And that's one reason why we took swift and aggressive action in the first months of my administration.  No blogger.  To pull our economy...  Oh, goodness.  Sorry about that, guys.  To pull our economy back from the brink.  He can't...  Including the largest.  He can't really improv very well with the president. 
[03:29:00]  By the way, anyone who thinks she's the first black president, he just said, oh, goodness.  Oh, goodness.  He's my nana.  He should have been like, what the fuck was that?  Or at least what happened.  Oh, goodness.  Wow.  He's a nerd.  He can't have a moment ever, this guy.  What?  There is no moment there.  No, no.  That should have been funny.  That should have been a thing for a while.  Yeah, yeah.  Instead of sorry about that, and then he continues with his speech.  I will say, though...  Because everyone there is going to be looking at the floor at the broken glass, right? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah.  He's talking about the global economy in the world.  Are we expecting to go on an eight-minute riff like he's fucking the Reverend Bob Levy?  All right.  Good point.  He just looked.  Blogger...  Oh, goodness.  Sorry, guys.  Blogger?  Sorry, guys.  Says blowjob on MSNBC, or Dwight makes a cuckold reference while talking to Andy on The Office.  I say the blogger.  Yeah, I want blogger.  Because cuckolding is fun.  Wait, wait, wait.  I want cuckolding. 
[03:30:00]  I don't give a fuck.  See, because...  If you guys want cuckolding, I found a really cool video.  Let's go on.  See, now we've got to go cuckolding to set up the cool video from Danny.  I said cuckolding so it would reverse it, and we would get the one we wanted.  But now Danny stepped in with some real cuckolding.  Look, we're not stupid.  We know we've lost just about all our audience today.  We're just doing this stuff for ourselves.  I'll drop an ethics bomb on you.  Would you steal bread to feed your family? 
[03:30:30]  Boom!  It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male.  No, that's not how it works.  Cuckold.  Sounds like an Eric Paul.  Oh, shit.  Oh, Danny.  It's a cuckold.  Holy shit, Danny.  What's that about Danny?  There's something going on behind the scenes.  I love Eric to death.  I love Eric.  But, like, you know...  You know this clip has been sitting in front of me for two months?  Yeah, he'll go... 
[03:31:00]  For what reason?  Well, you said reason.  Just in case there's a fucking reason.  So now, you know, anytime anybody else has reason today, Eric will probably pull it,  and then six months from now we'll play it and go, why did we just play that?  He's going to pull a reason out.  Oh, no.  We've got to hear earth, wind, and fire now?  No, he just goes...  Eric likes to go super deep when he brings stuff to the table.  Okay.  Here comes Z-Rock to defend himself.  Look at him.  He's in defensive mode as he marches down the hall.  This could be good.  That takes him a long time to get there. 
[03:31:30]  Oh, shit.  Hi, Eric.  What's wrong?  Nothing.  Not my pull.  Not your pull.  No.  All right.  Here comes Pass the Buck.  I love Pass the Buck.  I don't know, but apparently this was so important for me to come down here to express this.  Oh!  What do you mean by that?  I was cutting something else up, and somebody said, oh, they're talking about you.  Go in there.  So that's what I did. 
[03:32:00]  What were you cutting it to?  Cutting something else up.  A hero.  They're yummy.  Ice cream.  I know they are.  They are tasty.  But just the fact that that's what you would classify as works is just how Anthony said that.  Cutting something else.  What are you cutting it up?  What are you cutting it up?  Other production and stuff.  Oh, that's funny.  But, yeah, that was not my pull.  I wish it was your wrist.  Sorry, Eric.  No. 
[03:32:30]  There he goes.  What were you cutting up, though?  This is various production for some other stuff.  Nothing of importance to mention on the air here.  Well, one time Jeff Dunham was on an episode of Star Search in 1988.  I hate and Eric was doing a pull that for you because Jeff Dunham came up today.  What the fuck are you talking about?  Oh.  All right.  Good question.  Yeah, Danny, explain.  No, I'm just saying.  Does he have a tendency of what?  He likes to go super deep.  Fight. 
[03:33:00]  A dummy and a white.  Eric likes to go deep.  Who's who?  I didn't say a drunk in a white.  Would have been me.  Go ahead, Eric.  Danny's saying that basically you're just a bum who looks for keywords and pulls shit audio.  Can't we all just get along and watch a good cuckold video?  Go.  Basically, Danny's implying that you wouldn't know a good video if you almost accidentally ate it.  Go.  Holy shit.  But I don't pull any of that stuff. 
[03:33:30]  That's all Danny and Sam's position.  Oh, what's that?  Your weight around here?  You don't pull any of that.  Why'd you push him?  Yeah, that's right.  He can't.  He's a bully.  You rock bullies, me.  Cool.  All right, Eric.  Grab some bully audio.  Fool.  I'm cute.  I'm going to be Wooly Bully the song.  Because you guys did bully, remember?  Gotcha.  Look, he just called him a fool. 
[03:34:00]  He is.  He can't just call him a fool.  Sure I can.  He is.  The funniest part is people are, like, actually trying to do something.  I see.  And it's just shit all over them.  Cutting something up.  We know it's not a rug, fat boy.  Oh, shit, man.  Oh, my God.  It's right, though.  They're working their balls off, and we don't give a shit.  Just shit on everybody.  That's what this whole fucking show is.  They just want recognition that they're working for the show, and we just won't acknowledge 
[03:34:30]  that.  Yes, Sam.  Sam can't fucking get away without shitting on him.  Because, well, now that that's all over, now that E-Rock has been thrown under the bus  for it, I figured I'd come in and let you know that, oh, you asked me to pull that  for the show, and I just wanted to let E-Rock take some heat for it, and then I'd, uh...  In all fairness, someone...  Oh, now I know.  Uh-oh.  Someone tweeted that to me, and I said, oh, okay, it has to be good for the show, and 
[03:35:00]  I never listened to it myself.  Yeah, well...  Yeah, it was probably an E-Rock tweet anyway.  It was E-Rock.  Those tweets are horrible.  Yeah, they're the worst.  What, you like his whole, uh, Wee Punch Out tutorial?  Those tweets stink.  Did you read when he started tweeting that, uh, he was spending the weekend watching movies  that everybody's already seen, like, 20 years ago?  He said, I'm watching 16 Candles today.  Oof.  Just so we can get to the cake.  You know...  My goal, I want to make him dance.  I want to bring him to a dance club and make him stand on a bath mat, and then just bullwhip 
[03:35:30]  him while he dances nude for the amusement of club goers who are on ecstasy.  I just want to savagely bullwhip his nude body, put oil on it, nice warm oil.  Holy shit.  What is his...  What...  What are some of his latest tweets?  E-Rock.  Oh, they're fucking horrendous.  What is he on Twitter?  He's E-Rock Radio.  E-Rock Radio, okay.  This is on the fucking news in New York City.  Mm-hmm. 
[03:36:00]  Oh, fuck.  Santa Claus guys.  Yeah.  He's a real tweet-aholic, this kid.  He posted about an hour ago.  Good meeting.  How's he tweeting while he's supposed to be at work?  Jesus.  Why wouldn't he listen to the Santa Claus audio to see if it's good for the show?  Oh, God.  Look at that picture of Steve.  All right, you know what?  I'm in with...  Cock first picture of Steve.  I'm in with E-Rock Radio now.  Steve was out today.  I miss him.  And he's got the worst picture of Steve ever. 
[03:36:30]  He's wearing Sportabout jeans.  Sportabout?  Steve's wearing heavy man casual slacks.  I hope Steve had to take those jeans off.  I hope they had to be cut off by a paramedic.  For a fucking spine injury.  That's my dream with Steve.  Is that he's running across the street for a yoo-hoo and he's mowed down by a cab.  I have a craving for a yoo-hoo and some fucking, some Russian just runs into him and fucking 
[03:37:00]  severs his spine and they fucking cut his fat boy jeans off.  Oh, yeah, here's the tweet that Sam was talking about.  Catching up on movies I never saw, Pretty in Pink.  Love James Spader.  16 Candles later today.  He put love James Spader? 
[03:37:30]  He's a giant James Spader fan.  No, he only loves him in less than zero because he wants to be treated like Julian was.  He wants to have a reason to suck dicks.  And he wants a bearded man to drive him to a motel.  Force him to fill eight men for coke money.  Less than zeros.  How much weight he's lost in the past year.  And how much he's contributed to this program.  What an asshole. 
[03:38:00]  He didn't even do anything.  That's exactly the issue.  That's the best part of this.  That's the best part.  It's just shit on people that are working.  He did do something.
