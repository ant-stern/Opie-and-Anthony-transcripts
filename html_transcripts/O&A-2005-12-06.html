<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the bird flu, its potential pandemic threat, and conspiracy theories linking it to political distractions from the Iraq War.  Callers Eric (Colorado) and Wade (Toronto) offered contrasting perspectives, with Eric downplaying the threat based on the flu's long history, and Wade recounting a local Legionnaires' disease outbreak. This transitioned into a broader conversation about media credibility, comparing past disease scares (Ebola, Legionnaires') to the current climate, and contrasting the perceived objectivity of Walter Cronkite's era with contemporary news biases.  Studio guest Patrice O'Neal then joined the show.

The conversation with O'Neal covered mortality, personal finances, racial stereotypes around financial habits, and culminated in the crudely humorous “What’s in My Pants” game involving a caller describing her pubic hair via sounds. O'Neal then recounted a humorous anecdote about hiring a cleaning crew, leading to discussions about perceived work ethic differences across racial and generational lines, using offensive language and stereotypes throughout.  This segment also included discussions about hiring tradesmen and further offensive banter from the hosts.  Anthony then launched into a lengthy explanation of his elaborate home security system, complete with airlocks and motion detectors, interspersed with jokes about confronting intruders and a shotgun-wielding girlfriend. This was followed by audio clips mocking local news channels' overreactions to minor snowstorms.  The segment also featured voice-over comparisons between an angry baby and Joe Pesci, a clip from a Dennis Leary Comedy Central special, mention of a future guest with Tourette's Syndrome, and banter about eggnog drinking contests and related submitted audio of vomiting.

The show included a phone interview with the band Kairos, who were opening for Bon Jovi.  The hosts poked fun at the band's photo and long song lengths (5-12 minutes), as well as the familial relationships within the band. A short audio clip of their song "Saturate" was played. This transitioned into a discussion about the New Jersey bear hunt, including interviews with participating hunters, debates about the hunt's ethics, and broader discussions of human impact on nature and overpopulation.  This segment also featured listener calls, discussions about “annoying” songs, promotion of upcoming “Tissue Time” and “Most Annoying Songs” segments, and further commentary on the bear hunt.  Patrice O'Neal was again briefly mentioned to promote a gig.

The show continued with a discussion on bear hunting, expanding into broader ethical debates surrounding meat consumption and animal slaughter.  The hosts and callers debated bear hunting methods, the sheer volume of animals killed for food, and the emotional disconnect between witnessing animal slaughter and enjoying the meat. Graphic descriptions of slaughterhouse processes were included. This segment featured Lewis, a stand-up comedian with Tourette’s Syndrome. The hosts engaged Lewis in escalating bets on his ability to remain tic-free, using his condition as a source of humor and prompting him to demonstrate his tics.  Lewis also discussed his condition, his experiences, his children's book, "Little Twitching Timmy the Turtle with Tourette's," and the challenges of social interaction, sometimes using humor to address his tics, including discussing how they enhance his sex life. The segment culminated in Lewis attempting a stand-up routine punctuated by tics and the hosts’ commentary, followed by promotion of a Jägermeister music tour.

The final segment featured Lewis Black, who recounted experiences with Tourette's in various situations, including a bank and phone sex, using vulgar language and humor.  He described an encounter with Nicole Richie, promoted his children’s book ("Little Twishing Timmy, the Turtle with Tourette's"), shared a negative experience with a dismissive teacher, and engaged in lighthearted banter with the hosts about his tics.

[00:12:00]  blow up the entire building no one is saying like no it's like can i get some news and i want it from  the regular news i don't want to take what w w dot uh the truth news dot dot uk dot co like you gotta go to  the goddamn uh england pages you're never gonna find real news ever there's always gonna be a slant  no matter what right it's like no matter if you get it on the internet on your tv on your cell phone yeah 
[00:12:30]  george bush ain't shit dot org all right man i want to hear it might be biased can i hear from fox  no you're not gonna get it hey uh we got an expert on tv eric from colorado he's got something on the  bird flu eric go ahead hey morning boys morning hey hey one of the local talk radio hosts he's had like  out here in colorado he's had like three or four guests on about this the bird flu has been a problem  they've been able to trace it back into the 50s and there's actually been outbreaks of it before 
[00:13:00]  there was one in the late 80s there was one in the 90s and worldwide it has killed less than 500  people in all of the outbreaks that has ever happened from it that's nothing there you go they  said that the only their biggest concern is the the first outbreak was in the in europe and then they  never had a problem in europe until recently and that's they said in the past it always happened  in southeast asia they said the only concern that they have is that it has now spread to turkey and 
[00:13:30]  to some other parts of europe but otherwise it's extremely little risk that's what i'm thinking  yeah you know the next year next year they won't even be talking about the bird flu and you gotta think  uh... to yourself well what happened to the bird flu what happened to the bird flu do they kill all the chickens where they now for diseases  behind the music for bird flu it'll be the i love the thousands the fuckin patrice on there man what happened to the bird flu 
[00:14:00]  commenting about the bird flu commenting about the bird flu i love diseases what the fuck happened to the bubonic plague that shit was crazy  i love it you wanna have you dressed up with a parrot on your shoulder what happened to the bird flu let me ask my parrot what happened to the bird flu  i love when they say the obvious on those stupid shows so there was this disease called the bird flu 
[00:14:30]  and what they say is all right shut up and then they cut to all of them and go bird flu bird flu bird flu  how come i can't get like see that guy right there i can't he's like george but i hate george bush dot org kind of guy  it's like i i why can't a guy with that information there'd be a credible news thing that just says what he just said  and i can accept it because it's it's regular news no but you can go to some other guy or some other news thing and it's the worst disease ever 
[00:15:00]  yeah i mean i just want to hear you know the opposite love of the the bullshit that we know is bullshit  i kind of like you know and i've always said this one it was just one guy on the news you turn it on walter cronkite  he did all the research for you blurted out the news that night  it was a wooden desk a clock behind him a name you can trust that was him  he had his own slant  walter cronkite made the tech offensive bruise  the vietnamese can still mount the defensive 
[00:15:30]  something the government said that was impossible  i now believe this is a stalemate and declare the war unwinnable  then everyone went holy shit cronkite said the war is unwinnable  well fuck it  if if the if the vietnam war right like the v back in the day right  yeah yeah how did that now i know the government wasn't going  they weren't somewhere that was back when they were really doing bad stuff  oh and they were in charge back then  they were in charge  people people spoke up fuck you  how come they couldn't hide how bad the vietnam war was to in in our eyes you know what i'm saying 
[00:16:00]  like why why couldn't they like it was like  well it's the first war that they televised on tv  yeah i think in a limited capacity  it was not like today where you could punch up the internet and get music videos made by soldiers  but it wasn't video that was taken yesterday  but it wasn't that limited because there were there were so many less uh channels  so if you did show any type of footage from vietnam a lot of people were checking that out  and it was shit from like you know  as soon as they got that stuff to you it was like a week  later 
[00:16:30]  who gave the information out that they was killing villages like doing the whole cock it down  yeah but there were a lot of reporters over there that would and they weren't reporters like  now where they tell you you shut the fuck up and report this  they were like you know pool reporters  there was a time when the news was like actually credible  yeah that shit was like in your face  they would link up with people and and walk around and  know why  film what they wanted  because they had to go out on their own  yeah these guys are out there getting shot  you've got some mike wallace video  of that motherfucker being shot at 
[00:17:00]  some fucking gook is shooting at mike wallace  and he's got a microphone  we're here  uh it's looking really bad  i think your reporting is going to be a lot more accurate if you go out in the field on your own  with this new war they're embedding reporters and stuff  they're protecting themselves  of course you're going to have a slight slant like  oh well  yeah  i guess it's not too bad considering they're protecting me pretty well out here  yeah those guys were being shot at  going back slightly  wade in toronto  legionnaires disease  we brought that up a few minutes ago 
[00:17:30]  yeah  go ahead uh wade  hey guys how are you  hey man  that legionnaires disease  hit here this past summer  knocked out sixteen people  in an old age home  there you go  sixteen people died of the legionnaires disease  what's the symptoms of that thing  it's like pneumonia  it's like a respiratory thing right  it's like pneumonia  you're breathing some bad air  a lot of people get it from the air conditioning systems  that's exactly what happened  two people next door  to the old age home  came down with the pneumonia  and now they're suing  because they said it came through the air conditioning  you got like bacteria  builds up in the ductwork 
[00:18:00]  and blows it out all over the hospital  yeah  oh this was one of the big diseases  when we were growing up  that was supposed to kill a lot of people  yeah  didn't do shit  the ebola virus didn't do shit  we were all supposed to melt away remember  ebola  that was it for me  yeah  I told you  that was it for me  we were talking about that  ebola  that was it  but it's such a motherfucking disease  that it can't leave where it starts  but they haven't cured that  who cares  but all the uh  who cares about curing that  there's a million articles  a million pieces on tv  about the ebola virus 
[00:18:30]  we were all gonna get liquefied  yeah  I remember that  orifices  it was  bleeding from the eyes  nose  mouth  ears  ass  dick  everywhere you're bleeding from  and then you're just like  your liquids  you're in it's turned to liquid  and you just die right there  I don't even know  like  somebody like  what's the one  the baseball player  Lou Gehrig's is bad too  like but I never  like  who  who gets that one  who gets that  like who even  the Lou Gehrig's  like where does these  like which ones  should we be afraid  you know

[00:20:30]  the machine from the fly  the thing he was trying to be  where you can like  zap yourself over somewhere  just zap myself somewhere man  that would be handy  I would just love  to be alive for that  you know what I'm saying  there you go  when you're like  I remember when I was like  seven or eight or something  when you first come to  the realization that  you know  you're not just going to be  skipping through life  for eternity  seven or eight  Jesus  yeah it's like seven or eight  and you get  you start thinking  you know mortality slips in  and seven or eight years old  yeah seven or eight  you start thinking about  like oh  and you start counting the years 
[00:21:00]  and go alright  and then  but I got to the point  I'm going to be honest  that's a white guy thing  I'm going to be very honest  white people don't think about life  until at least 30  really?  at least  we start thinking about mortality at 30  white people think about mortality at 80  where you go from child  where you have no concept of it  of anything  and then you wake up one day  and go holy shit  one day I'm going to die  you mean one day you drop dead  and that's like what happens  and then  and then like after that  no?  really?  no  absolutely  that was one of the worst days of my life 
[00:21:30]  that maybe that's why y'all plan so well  like you guys have wills  there you go  things like that  you've got to plan  you just start planning at eight  but I didn't know  I didn't start planning  you have the realization  but what you do  is you start counting  years  and you go like  you know  it's going to be like  2000  in the 2000s  2000 like  I don't know  whatever it is  and you think  by that time  these motherfuckers  are going to have like  spaceships on different planets 
[00:22:00]  we're going to have  that all figured out  there's going to be  machines  where they could put you  in a machine  and then you'll be  you know  you but in a robot body  that looks like you  and what did we get?  nothing  we got internet porn  that's the biggest thing  but that's another thing  we talked about  the flying car  the stupid flying car  that we never got  that we were promised  but that thing  when you finally  get the realization  at like seven  you go  there's so much time  that they gotta invent something  it's going to be  in our lifetime 
[00:22:30]  that they invent  the immortality pill  or the fucking thing  and then you grow up  and you know what  ripped off  robbed  we're realizing  it's not going to be  our generation  it ain't ours  and you know  some kids growing up  it ain't yours either  that's right  but we are in a good time though  we are  we're in a good time  which is  we hit the information age  the end of the world  fear time  are you shitting me?  that's a great time to be in  this is not  end of the world  fear time  end of the world  fear time  was the friggin  70s and 80s  when I swear to god 
[00:23:00]  you never knew  when you used to sit there  and smoke pot  with your friends  back then  you'd start looking up  at the ceiling  and like your shoulders  would hunch up  because you're thinking  those motherfuckers  could launch a bomb  right now  and incinerate us  scarier end of the world  now  because it's nature  end of the world  now  now it's  god  it's god  end of the world  diseases  hurricanes  earthquakes  no that's just  still a hurricane  in the middle of winter  in December  there's an earthquake  coming  but that's shit 
[00:23:30]  that's been around  shit that's been around  forever  and life goes on  the bubonic plague  shit like that  where Europe was like  decimated  shit like that  that stuff has happened  before  for some reason  humanity always pulls through  there was always that  wait a minute  I'm laughing at  old ass Anthony  cause old ass Anthony  I know this motherfucker  was one of those kids  that hit they did  the nuclear bomb  duck and cover  under the table  oh yeah  they put our asses  under a fucking desk  and it was a guy 
[00:24:00]  with the scratchy  thing going  and it was skipping  and you get him  under the tables  here's what we did  that's what we'd hear  we'd go  we'd go  uh oh  oh air raid alert  air raid alert  and then  Anthony used to do  nuclear bombs  students please  get under your desks  under your desks  and I'm like  oh this could be the one  from that movie  the day after tomorrow  yeah  that was the one 
[00:24:30]  oh my god  that's what I grew up in  and when I was in  really like  elementary school  up until about  the fifth grade  or so  it was get under the desk  then they changed  this fucking thing  where  from sixth grade  and then they stopped  doing it after that  I guess  we'd have to go out  into the hallway  they changed it  because I guess  we got too big  for the desk  go into the hallway  and then there were  the younger students  that were against  the wall  and our job 
[00:25:00]  was to kind of  shield them  with our body  over the eye  and I'm looking at  this little kid  going  this motherfucker  I'm a fucking  nuclear shield now  against the picture  of both of y'all  fading into dust  oh forget it  the backwards fade  the fade  you know  fade backwards  into the nuclear dust  with our shadows  burnt on the tile wall  of our elementary school  looking like Pompeii  shaking both  false security  for everybody 
[00:25:30]  but I looked  and even then  I thought  what if they are using  I am friggin'  cannon fodder  they are using me  as a meat shield  that's funny  for this kid  let's go to the phones  Glenn in New Jersey  Glenn what's up  what's up boys  how you doing  really good  make it fast  hey Patrice  I just want to let you know  the reason why  the white man  has the will  is because  we don't piss away  all of our money  on fucking gold rims  and diamonds  someone's gotta get  left to gold rims  I can't be angry at that  because it's just  I don't know what it is  we just  white people think 
[00:26:00]  about the future  more than we do early  the white people  think about the future  at 15  I'm thinking about  the future now  because I'm  just getting older  I'm thinking about  credit now  like when I was  in college  I'm like  I owe 5,000  kiss my  nigga  you think you're  going to get this  $5,000  Mr. O'Neill  you owe $5,000  we're going to go  and get your  yeah whatever  take it  if you can take it  motherfucker  I got  yeah but that's  a white thing  I got four different  social security numbers  oh  oh really  it's like 
[00:26:30]  find it  motherfucker  so  but now  I'm like  when I go  and I start  learning about  things like  closing costs  and  mortgage rates  some  you know  we can refinance  that for you  like percentage  like  what are  interest rates  interest rates  do you think  that's a word  that I use  from the age  of 12  to 32  interest rate  I'm like  oh I can get a car  yeah but it's  going to be like  at least 22%  interest  I just got a car 
[00:27:00]  I get the car  you know something  that isn't a  that isn't a black  white thing  it's certainly not  that's a broke  not broke thing  because when I was  broke  I swear to you  same fucking thing  I could care less  I got credit cards  with  with the interest  was like 25%  25% interest  and I'm out there  buying VCRs  like he's Donald Trump  jet skis  like he's Donald  fucking Trump  and then  the thought  never crossed my mind  how I was going to  pay for it  because it wasn't 
[00:27:30]  money  it wasn't money  I hand them the plastic  they give me what I want  you worry about it later  so you think it's a  it's a money thing  it's a poor  not poor  white people just  and this is not a credit  to white people  it's just  white people just  think about different things  I think as a whole  not saying better or worse  but I just  like I wish  I've spent  I think I've spent  $120,000  on jewelry  yeah  and  I've  I've taken it back 
[00:28:00]  and they never  give you what you  you know  I just get tired of it  and I go  hey  like my first  got my first couple of dollars  I had a pinky ring  that covered my entire pinky  you know what I mean  it went up to my fingernail  so I'm walking around  like what's happening baby  I'm on the train  you know what I'm saying  I'm on the train  and I'm  I'm buying  gold microphones  and I'm glad  I wasn't one of these  stupid ass comics  like dumb Nick DiPaolo  or stupid Kevin  who puts like that  I'm dead serious  about this game  happy  smiley  sad face

[00:37:00]  I guess  What's In My Pants  with Patrice on you  then we gotta play  of course we do  I thought you were  calling for tissue time  but we'll do that  a little later  yeah no  I don't have time  for that  but I wanted to play  What's In My Pants  where are you  in Georgia  yeah  where in Georgia  like home  no I'm in my car  right now  alright I gotta figure  all this out  give me a pad  and a piece of paper  in your car  are you driving  no I'm waiting  to be able to go  alright how old are you  27  27  so far so good 
[00:37:30]  he's writing  alright  height  I'm 5 foot 2  5 foot 2  oh boy  ok  petite gal  oh boy  that's good  no that's good  so far  alright  breast size  I'm actually  a 34B  34B  that's ok  what's the problem  so far Opie  34B  that's about as big  as a tits should be  yeah  34B  do you know  you're um  and now 
[00:38:00]  here comes  the big question  and we know  already  the plus factor  so  put plus  5  plus 5  ok go ahead  how much do you weigh  um  it's about 120  so 125  125  125  125  yeah 52125  5-2  with B's  I think that's the same size  as Michael Westbrook  from Philadelphia  she's a squatty little thing  do you have a 
[00:38:30]  a butt on you  yeah  that's what it is  yeah that's where  I was wondering where  the extra  couple of pounds  came from  white girl  yeah yeah  are you a gymnast  no  no  but I do have a lot of  that's where it comes from  you got a lot of muscle  yeah  oh boy  a little muscle  alright  well um  this actually  isn't just to see  what you look like  for some kind of  fantasy thing  it does help out  in guessing the hairstyle 
[00:39:00]  sure  ok  certain girls  of certain heights  and weights  have certain hairstyles  uh  on the average  but you never know  she could surprise us  uh  you wanna play the song  uh  well you wanna do  the rules first or  um  I think we  do the  the song first  alright let's do the song first  stupid song first  happy song Mr. Ellie  place the receiver 
[00:39:30]  upon your beaver  it's time to play  hey guess what's in my pants  it's time  to guess  what's in my pants  my pants  alright Amy  here are the rules  for the people at home  uh  Amy at no time  are you to uh  tell us what you have  in your pants  or give us a hint  until we uh  ask you  ok  and for the people  uh playing at home  you could play at home  it's great  uh  she's gonna take the phone  rub it as per our direction 
[00:40:00]  on her  most intimate of area  and uh  we will ask her to rub it  back and forth  up and down  and in a circular fashion  and based solely on the sound  coming from the phone  we will discern  the hairstyle  absolutely  that is in her pants  we're experts at this  patrice  here are the choices  the basic  standard issue  woman triangle  of hair  ok  this could be a  big 70's earth mama muff 
[00:40:30]  or a trimmed  uh  type of  kept uh  clean triangle  but we're talking  a full triangle  full triangle  now you can say  it's a big bush  or it's a nicely  trimmed triangle  that'll get you  extra points  that's amazing  if you can do that  but there's no  hair  the length of hair  is what counts  right  there's no lining  there's no  right  they've left the  natural shape  just kind of  trimmed down  the height of it  then there is  the mohawk  everybody that's been 
[00:41:00]  with strip clubs  knows what this is  it's the strip of hair  that goes down  it's usually  yeah  it's usually as long  as the triangle  was high  they don't shave down  the top of it at all  it's just a strip  it looks good  until they stand up  you don't see that much  anymore though  that doesn't look bad  standing up  what looks awful  standing up  or laying down  on their back  is the Hitler mustache  this is the mohawk  but they have 
[00:41:30]  not only trimmed  in the sides  they have cut down  like from the  belly button  downward  until it is a  little Hitler mustache  it's a tuft of hair  that's like what  Ray Charles had  right there  under his lip  it's a goatee  it looks ridiculous  when their legs  are spread  because it's  it's like  shaved  but then there's  this patch of hair  out of nowhere  yeah  okay  looks silly  then  of course  all the rage  lately  the 
[00:42:00]  wood floor  clean shaved  nothing there  or  as we like to call it  on this program  the JonBenet Ramsey  just nothing  why did you  raise your eyebrows  about what  you don't like  no not that part  before that  you don't like  the clean shave  you're not seeing  the clean shaven  out there a lot  well not with  Brazilian girls  probably  black girls  don't really do that  either  black girls  don't shave at all  it itches  when it grows back  and they get 
[00:42:30]  the same  stuff that  black men  will get on their face  get the razor bumps  down there  yeah the razor bumps  they're not very careful  they're not very careful  you don't want that  the itching  so a lot of times  black girls  black women have one  that you miss  I don't know  white girls do  it's the triangle  it's the triangle  Hitler mustache  it's it's a it's the triangle  but instead of the the whole vagina  it's the from the clit up  so they trim it  so it's all 
[00:43:00]  I got  from the clitoris up  wow yeah yeah  and the middle's taken out  I've seen that  all the extra from the side  and the lips and everything  is all  everything's clean  that's that's that part  is a triangle  yeah  that's interesting  all right Amy  you're naked  Amy  yeah where are you  you're in your car  what are you wearing  I'm in my car  so I just had to  I'm getting ready for work  so  what are you wearing  pants skirt  yeah pants  pants so  got them pulled down  just a little bit  you could access 
[00:43:30]  you got to be able to  access that bush  or whatever it is  you got down there  okay  no we're good  all right  if you can  take the phone now  and rub it up and down  on your area  we will listen in  okay hold on  all right  is that good  or no  that's good  that's good  that's telling  it's a little telling  okay now  side to side  okay hold on 
[00:44:00]  I need more  side to side  yeah definitely  yeah do it like  I don't know  five six times  okay hold on  I heard something  yeah yeah  but I don't think  it was  hair related  all right 
[00:44:30]  Amy  can I ask you  another question  sure  are you married  no  have you ever  had any children  no  okay  just asking  now the circular  fashion  if you just  take it  and go in  circles  around the area  okay hold on  all right  I need the 
[00:45:00]  side to side  again  side to side  yeah  like five times  side to side  please  okay hold on  it's a tough one  it's not too tough  it's tough  I'm hearing something  but I don't think  it's it's hair  that I'm hearing  I'm hearing  it's just  I thought I heard  the phone  I thought I heard  the phone  getting stuck  on the skin  and then pop  yeah yeah  that's what I  think I'm hearing  I was gonna go  with uh  completely shaven  but now I think  I gotta change  my thing  I I think 
[00:45:30]  it's sounding  a little too  you would think  see here's a  misconception  I'll help some  of the people out  that the clean  shaven is very  quiet  like this  clean shaven  is loud  when they shave  it you hear  this sounds like  some hair  is patting it  but I can't  quite figure out  how much  all right  I'll start  I hope he's  gonna start  what are you  going with  I'm gonna take  a big chance  here  I think it's  a finally  it's a triangle 
[00:46:00]  you're gonna say  the natural triangle  but trimmed  a little bit  exactly  now any triangle  will get you  the win  that'll just be  an amazing  credit to you  and your ears  thank you  if it is  true  thank you  Patrice  same thing  same thing  there's something  going on  matter of fact  no husband  no kids  little goofy  little squatty girl  I say full  bush  wow  we've never  found a full  bush  there's no reason  for this little  mess to shave  wait there's a couple  other questions  we should ask 
[00:46:30]  are you married  or you're not married  you don't have a boyfriend  no I don't have a boyfriend  that means she's going  out a lot  is she a lesbian  she's gonna keep it  all nice down there  lesbian  no no no  all right  all right  I heard  here's what I'm gonna say  I'm going  I'm going with the Mohawk  because I heard  I heard something  on that side to side  that I can't  now I can't get it  out of my mind  I think it was  now with a full bush  I don't think you'd have  heard that deviation 
[00:47:00]  in the middle  of the stroke there  nah she's trying to  just like her phone rub  is the same thing  as her life  where she's trying to  convince you of things  yeah  this is a lonely  little mess  and she has a full bush  and she knows this game  so she knows  the skills  you weren't paying  attention  why  she says she's a little  big down there  yeah  she's calling it muscle  but it's heat  what you were hearing  there is like a vag dimple  oh Jesus 
[00:47:30]  you think it's a little  bit of plumpness  yeah a little stussy  I'm thinking  that she would  trim it up though  because that's  one thing  she can do  to make it a little  nicer down there  this little poor thing  is struggling  a little bit  I feel she doesn't  she doesn't  pay that much  attention  she's rushing to work  I like this one  there's no way  it's trimmed up  because Amy  I gotta tell you  a lot of the  guess what's in my  pants  contestants that have 
[00:48:00]  called up  we've right off the bat  just gone boom  boom boom  this is it  this is it  a lot of us  have the same  guess  you've kept  us kind of  in a mystery  over here  well I guess  it's time  Amy if you  would tell us  what is in  your pants  I hope he was  right  it's a trim  triangle  both of us  are right  trim triangle  beautiful  great job  and Patrice  gets credit  though too  for the triangle  I wanted to  just be right 
[00:48:30]  with you  but I just  damn it  I really thought  I heard the  skin  getting caught  was it the  skin  but then when  she did it  the second time  it was a smooth  stroke  Amy do you know  what's that  deviation that  you got going  down there  I'm not sure  what you mean  it made a sound  it went like  like it was  falling into  something  in the middle  of your stroke  oh  is it a little  plump  do you have  a plump  one down there  not particularly 
[00:49:00]  no  is there a  definite like  cleft  in the middle  um  no  but you're  getting me  a little  worried  here  no  don't be  worried  Jesus  it's a  pussy  guys love  him  it doesn't  matter  what the  fuck  don't you  worry  that's why  I thought  it was a  bush  just cause  of her  whole demeanor  poor thing  well bravo  Opie  she takes abuse  well  I don't do  well in this  game usually  I'm thinking  about it too  much  I'm starting  to pay more  attention on this 
[00:49:30]  show  I heard  some things  Amy  thank you  so much  thanks guys  and thanks for  playing  guess what's  in my  pants  all right there 
[00:50:00]  you have it  that came out  of nowhere  today  I see dimple  I thought we  were going to  do tissue  time  no no maybe  later  a little later  we'll do  another installment  of tissue  time  you have  you have  a housekeeper  that comes over  a polish housekeeper  opening  does she still  come over  for your house  she'll be there  tomorrow  it's my  luxury 
[00:50:30]  see this is a  Manhattan thing  that is I  think great  anybody can get  this type of  housekeeper  I'm in a very  nice neighborhood  and it's very  hard for me to  find I just  want a  somebody that  can come in  and you know  little dusting  little cleaning  of the bathroom  and things like  that and  can't find one  so yesterday  it's like you're  holding auditions  this crew  comes in  to do the  initial like 
[00:51:00]  cleanup  because it's  been a while  we really  I'm looking for  another house  so it's not like  I have a lot of  furniture or anything  in this one  it's almost like  you know  the flop house  a base of  operations to  find the real  house  so I didn't  buy a bunch of  furniture for the  living room or  anything like that  we got like a  TV room set up  with a couch  and TV and  my computers and  stuff like that  but not a lot of  stuff so it  wasn't really  important to have  a housekeeper  come in but  I like when  they come in  maybe once a  week once every  two weeks 
[00:51:30]  something like  that just dust  everything off  so yesterday  this crew comes  in I don't know  where they're  from it looked  like what I  would picture  people from  Guatemala  different look  like different  countries we  haven't discovered  yet what  happened there's  there's countries  out there we  haven't discovered  just some tribe  out of the  rainforest they  were they  looked like  Incas they  had the face  of Incas you  know that very  distinct look with  the like the guy  that wears that  derby hat in  the down in  South America 
[00:52:00]  where they  built like  shoes yeah  right little  squatty boxes  squatty thing I  don't know what  they were what  happened to all  right Mr.  C I'll be here  again in two  weeks did I  find I vacuumed  the floor what  happened to  Americans white  people white  people that just  come in and  clean your house  people want to  do that shit I  don't know I'm  looking for what  American cleans a  house Hazel  Hazel hazel in  the good old  50s where you

[00:53:00]  and then wipes  the dust on the  tip of his nose  now you know  that's not  necessary  I want to ask  something as  she's like doing  the dishes and  have her pick up  the big apron to  dry her hands  I can ride on  that right away  just something  something classic  and when there's  money around she  leave it there  there was money  there now Mr.  I didn't touch  that money  I didn't touch  that money now  Mr.  get honest  as the day is  long  that's what I'm  looking for  she knows where

[00:54:00]  I needed  all kinds  of cleaning  stuff  I don't know  where this  shit is  I don't even  know if I have  it  they don't  bring their  own cleaning  stuff  bring your  own stuff  they don't  no I'll pay  I learned that  the first time  the Polish maid  came over  she comes  and she's  like  all I heard  was paper  towel  and I panicked  I'm going  oh shit  so now I'm  running around  trying to find  like paper  towels  I finally  found some  three rolls  to which  like a half  hour later  more paper  towel  I do  it  it's all  about the  paper towels 
[00:54:30]  and I'm like  motherfucker  I had to run  out  I had to run  out  and leave  them alone  in my house  as I ran  out  and I got  paper towels  the person you  set the cleaning  up with  they were  American  yeah  yeah  it's like  they're  American  but then they  send over  the crew  and the crew  is  I don't know  Guatemala  I don't know  where they were  from  so they're  around  so now I'm  looking  and I start  thinking  because you  know I got  my racist  mind working  and I'm  going  they could  just be  scoping  out the

[00:58:00]  you just  seem like  you would  be  whiter  than  Anthony  Anthony  just looks  like  he's  done  so  much  no  I need  you got  it wrong  I know  I don't  have it  wrong  I'm saying  if I  had to  prejudge  the  situation  I can't  believe  Anthony  like  that  has  never  happened  like  if  OP talked  like  this  I'd be  like  yeah  OP looks  like  he  probably  like  a  goddamn  cleaning  crew  has never  come  into a  place  and  kind  of  you  know  the  guy  maybe  they're  reputable  and the  company's  reputable  and they  hire  people  but then 
[00:58:30]  the  guy  goes  and  tells  his  friend  they  pick  those  people  up  on  the  side  of  like  Martin  King  Boulevard  in  the  morning  they  don't  have  they  can't  even  reach  the  windows  they're  4 foot  7  can I  just  get  American  white  people  anymore  here  was my  call  to  the  chimney  guy  because 
[00:59:00]  I'd  like  to  get  a  crackling  fire  in  my  fireplace  in  the  living  room  so  I  want  to  make  sure  the  chimney  is  fine  he's  walking  around  with  a  pipe  at  home  I  want  to  make  sure  it's  a  book  that  he  hasn't  finished  reading  for  magnifying  glass  Anthony  wants  to  live  the  good  life  I  want  to  live  my  house  is  like  it's  1955  Anthony  what do you want  you want  hard working  foreigners  right  or some  old white  woman 
[00:59:30]  with  personality  that won't  work  just like  old white  women  waitresses  I  want  1955  I  want  white  people  that  come  in  and  work  they  don't  work  anymore  because  they  where  did  they  go  Patrice  is  right  man  if you  want  a job  done  you  got  to  get  the  foreigner  they  work  their  balls  those  old  white  women  waitress  they  sound  like  the  old  hazels  they  don't  work  the  waitresses  with the  pet names  for you  because you  know why  they say  foreigners  so you 
[01:00:00]  can't  charm them  like you  go  coochie  coo  to  old  white  woman  and she  goes  okay  I'll  give  it  to  you  I'll  clean  the  stove  and I  won't  tell  anybody  goodbye  there's no  coochie  coo  with these  foreigners  they don't  speak  English  I don't  know what  happened  where did  they go  where did  the white  people go  overseas  they leave  they're still  there  I want  I want  the nice  housekeeper 
[01:00:30]  that's  with the  big beehive  hairdo  this is what's  going to cause  the race war  and then  yesterday  I'm trying  to clean  out my  chimney  make sure  it's nice  and good  so I call  up  I go  through  I find  two brothers  chimney  cleaning  two black  chimneys  two brothers  two brothers  not two black  guys  I figure  it's a couple  of white  guys  enterprising  guys  going into  business  and I call  up  and it's  like  well they're  not smart  business  two brothers 
[01:01:00]  chimney  clean  what you  need  B-R-U-B-E-R-N  fucking Russian  guys  they're Russians  and you know  this guy  again  like  in my country  before the  end of  Soviet Union  I was  engineer  at the  rocket  program  now I  got to  clean  fucking  chimneys  so he's  all bitter  and angry  and he  won't even  come  he goes  weather  don't look  good  I will  call you  back  when weather  clears  it's like  the weather  with flurries 
[01:01:30]  these are the  days I want  a crackling  fire in my  fireplace  where I can  open my  front windows  up and see  the snowfall  in my  neighborhood  how do you know  you made your  chimney done though  I don't but I  don't want to put a  log in there and  burn it up if  there's a big  clog in it  so I want the  Russian to go  through there and  make sure it's  you know  clean  because this  can be carbon  monoxide  deadly carbon  monoxide  back  there's no  carbon  monoxide  he is 
[01:02:00]  all in my  house  filling up with  smoke  this guy  and Anthony  you got barbed wire  in your arm  there's barbed wire  in the chimney  there is some  spools of  concertina wire  around my  compound  why barbed wire  in the chimney  ah these little  inkers came yesterday  it made me nervous  did I tell you  how I leave the  house every morning  Anthony do you  have a parakeet  in your basement  to make sure  there's no gas  canary in a coal  mine  the canary's dead  gas man's gone  here's how I leave 
[01:02:30]  my house in the  morning  I have a system  I have a system  I have the door  that goes from my  house to the garage  which of course  has a lock on it  so I go through  that and then I  lock that door  it's like get  smart  then I get  into my truck  and I lock  those doors  right  now I buckle  in  now I open  the garage door  the garage door  opens  and I pull out  so that way  any bad guys  would be stuck  you know 
[01:03:00]  in the middle  there if they're  trying to get  into my house  through the garage  and they can't  get into my  vehicle because  the door's locked  so you gotta  keep an airlock  away from  you and the  criminals  they're out there  oh they're out  there  the paranoia  it's acceptable  some of the  paranoia  I get that  paranoia  but you can't  you just can't  do that man  did you hear  about these  people that get  pistol whipped  and tied up  and robbed  it ain't gonna be 
[01:03:30]  me motherfucker  it ain't gonna be  me  the only time  I think on that  level is  it's not from  a person  robbing me  it's from  the police  like in case  I ever get  in some shootout  that I always  thought about  buying two houses  right across the  street from each  other and dig a  tunnel  and have a  rail system  no that's brilliant  I might go in  there and I  go hey come on  fuck you coppers  and I shoot here  and I get on my  rail system and  slide over to the  other house  like the great  escape you lay  down on that  skateboard on the  rails  hit with a shovel 
[01:04:00]  ding ding  that's the only  character I have  is police doing  something to me  but that whole  could you see  you know let me  ask you this  anybody that's been  in a home invasion  out there in  Suffolk County  Nassau County  my area that I  live in  home invasion  when it's  happening to  them they are  going holy shit  this is fucking  happening to me  what the fuck  am I gonna  I don't have  shit here  I have a box  I'm gonna hit  them with a box 
[01:04:30]  of tissues  that are on my  night table  that's it  someone comes  into my fucking  room they are  gonna be shocked  no they're not  yes they are  it's gonna look  like Fallujah  it's under the  bed  they gotta get  into my room  first  you didn't even  scare the inkers  they go this  idiot keeps  he's not giving  all his secrets  away  you still have  to get into  my room  and I'm sure  that door's  locked at night  motherfucker  Anthony has a  button like  quagmire from  Family Guy's  where the bed  flips into the  man  safe room 
[01:05:00]  Ant's basically  sleeping in a  panic room at  this point  that door is  locked so if I  hear somebody  rustling around  in a house  your girl stays  with you  oh she stays  with her own  place  she stays  with me  so is she  accepting to  this paranoia  or is she  like Anthony  come on now  you should see  her rack that  shotgun my  friend  you know these  two motherfuckers  are like the  two from  trimmers  they're waiting  for a giant  worm  give me the  x580  homemade dynamite 
[01:05:30]  you two  fucking  psychos  anyone that  breaks into  my fucking  house  is gonna  have to  contend with  some serious  shit  and this is  the stuff  and I hope  they didn't  bring a nice  what if I  just come over  and just go  surprise  you'll be  surprised at  the sucking  chest wound  that you will  have  and this is  the stuff  that he's  willing to  admit on the  show  he's got  other things  in place  he's got  trip wires  this is 
[01:06:00]  my  a lot of  motion  detectives  like no one  in the neighborhood  can sleep  because Anthony's  lights keep coming  on the porch  yeah it looks  like a disco  out back  walking his dog  hey Anthony  no it ain't me  it's my motion  detector  Anthony why do you  need a motion  detector  60 feet away  from your house  just in case  there's motion  this is just the  rental  so I don't have  any type of  high tech  cameras  once I move  into a house  forget it  I want all 
[01:06:30]  the latest  I want it like  Scarface with  the cameras  I want to see  the Colombians  coming over the  wall  why not live  this is why  I don't  move from  cities  you feel  all that  there's a  security feeling  to the city  where you walk  in there's a  doorman  you walk  you get on  your elevator  there's not a lot  of that going on  yeah tell the  woman that got  raped by the  fireman guy  yeah sure  tell the cops  family  tell that cop  family  guy pulls over  guy for speed  and he's shot 
[01:07:00]  where does he live  that has nothing  to do with the  paranoia you have  there are nasty  nasty people  in this city  there's nasty  people in Long  Island  of course there  are and I am  defending myself  against them  but it's the  difference between  okay it's less  than two evils  it's maybe get  shot as a cop  pulling somebody  over or maybe  getting raped by  a guy pretending  to be a god damn  fireman which is  a pretty elaborate  scheme here  I'll give you that  or home invasions  I lived in  fucking Brooklyn  which are home  invasions are  right this is what I'm saying 
[01:07:30]  if you live in a place  that can get home  invaded  you're living in a place  where you're gonna be  killed because home  invasion is one of  those crimes that's  right under murder  like four steps  under murder  you could go to jail  for the rest of your  life so if you're  willing to invade a  home you're willing  to kill somebody  I will  that's why he's got  the guns  kill them first  I want a nice house  why should I run in  fear from a nice  suburban house  because some people  want to invade  how many rooms 
[01:08:00]  you got  right now  three bedrooms  three bedrooms  Anthony's looking  forward to killing  somebody  no no  I'll be honest  with you  I'll be very candid  if you kill an  Inca  I will be very  candid and honest  with everybody out  there  I would feel  awful  and it would  probably change my  life and forever  like it would anyone  else that had to  take somebody's life  but it sure is  better than  you know  me laying there  with a hole in me  true  you know 
[01:08:30]  you gotta think  on those terms  alright  and why am I  running in fear  from a suburbia  I'd rather just  I believe that  bat myself in  but I'm just saying  the paranoia  in which you're  living right now  it's not paranoia  it's I am a realist  that's not a realist  it is realist  because those people  that were tied up  with their phone cords  or this one that gets  raped or pistol whipped  or shot from a home  invasion  every single one of them  you're not just going  oh god a home invasion  well 
[01:09:00]  I should have seen  this coming  I guess  you're sitting there  going  oh my god  it's happening to me  right now  holy shit  that's like Final Destination  that movie  where death is  chasing you  stalking him  right  you're like  trying to fight death off  no it's not a short thing  it's gonna happen  that ain't no short thing  if they're in my house  and I gotta look around  for a fucking pen  then oh  maybe I can jab it  in his throat  before he shoots me  no  no  I want  weaponry  that I can fucking  that overpowers theirs 
[01:09:30]  that takes them  by surprise  if they happen  to bust through  my fucking door  I will be behind  my thick mattress  and the second  I see them  gone  they won't even  get a chance  to see  are they sleeping  but you're in a rental  yeah  I'm thinking  if you're gonna do  some home invading  you're looking  for the really nice houses  what are they  looking at my lease first  with the nice  I have a very nice house  well obviously  it's just renting  well he's just  he's not a whole  oh look at his  oh look at his interest rates  he's got enough problems 
[01:10:00]  I don't think  your landscaping  is up to par  my landscaping  is gorgeous  I'm thinking  what do you think  I do that  wait so you have a landlord  I have Mexicans  that come over and do  yeah  yeah  I have a landlord  yeah  and he's allowing you  to put barbed wire  and all that  I don't have barbed wire  my house is a lovely  suburban home  from the outside  and there's your  your front door  open and closes  like Texas Chainsaw Massacre  like  like  if somebody's trying  to rob him 
[01:10:30]  he come out with a hammer  pop him on the head  pop him on the head  and then the door  just shuts  I drag him in  Anthony's leather face  with beautiful eyes  if he could  he would build  a motor  around his house  but the landlord  won't allow it  oh my god  you got a chainsaw  under that bed  no  no chainsaw  Anthony sounds like  the crusades 
[01:11:00]  Anthony's like  who goes there  it's Patrice  Andy  how you feeling  identify yourself  friend or foe  the bird  in July  flies highly  over the mountaintop  alright  call sign  and then it's like a bank  like a Brazilian bank  you gotta walk in  to a door  that door closes  and then  another door opens  the airlock of safety  I was telling you about  these people know 
[01:11:30]  see  you're not in a third world  country  have you been to  Brentwood  or wine dance  on Long Island  Anthony has third world  bank security  Steve's got a  Steve's got a question  for Anthony  from D.C.  yes Steve  hey Anthony  you taught your old lady  how to use a shotgun  what's that  you taught your old lady  how to use a shotgun  of course I did  what about a vacuum cleaner  can she figure that out  Steve what year do you think this is 
[01:12:00]  1957  punch it out boys  what do you think  women ain't doing the shit work anymore  what do you think  our girlfriends are doing house work  stop it  she's pumping a shotgun  first of all  she has to  she's gonna get killed  if she has to take the shotgun  take both hands  lean the butt of it  on her knee  no  and she clicks it down  and then it flies up too hard  it flies out of her hand  there's just no way  she's holding it going  yeah I gotta get a  little 8 gauge

[01:18:00]  you come in  with something  that is already  happening out there  that you got planned  don't plan anything  in my head  I just get up  and get on the train  and come down  you can't be giving  these people  these big laughs  and have nothing  what do you want  you gotta have  a myspace account  you gotta have  a website  you gotta have something  you know I gotta  figure out how  to do these things  I'm oblivious  how about you just  panhandle something  give us a street corner  where you're gonna be  panhandling  that's how you get paid  to do our show  I'm oblivious to this shit  Dane got where he is  but with this big 
[01:18:30]  grassroots movement  he had online  that's right  selling his own shit  myspace  he got on that  I don't  who the fuck  knows about being successful  look it  you gotta learn  these things I suppose  but I'm not a peddle  I can't peddle  my stuff  2005  almost 2006  you should have a website  by now  I'm talking about  a covered wagon  selling elixirs  I just got Comcast  I just got cable modem  I used to  I don't give a dial up  I'm telling you  you're one of the last  dial up guys  I'm not proud to be 
[01:19:00]  a complete idiot  but I'm saying  I don't  like after the show  when I see Voss and him  after people pay  $20  to muscle him  for another $20  for shit that you just said  for a CD  wow  you know what I mean  it's like  it's like  I don't  I hate doing that to people  like I want my  but they don't have to buy it  some people want this stuff  if they want  I'm gonna learn  how to give it to them  when they 
[01:19:30]  people  see that's why  you need to get online  you know  buy my shit  so you could sell it  to people that haven't  heard your act  but they hear you  here on the show  maybe  this guy sounds funny  I'd like to see what he does  I need a marketing plan  dude if you had a CD  we could sell you a lot  I'll get a CD  we could sell a lot of them  and then I hate to impose  that kind of shit  they're like  hey  hey  oh  I just like to come  and make people laugh  but it's not working  in terms of pocket change  no  in terms of money  just having an ethic  ain't working  motherfucker  I gotta get me 
[01:20:00]  a MySpace account  if you had a comedy show  in New York  you're gonna do the show  the rest of the week  we'd sell out the place  for you  no problem  ask Bill Burr  I got an email  from Bill recently  oh you did  he was at  I think Rascals  Thanksgiving weekend  he said the O&A fans  came out in droves  and it was one of the best  weekends he's ever had  in comedy  and that's just because  he was doing the radio show  our fans are very loyal  they support  I'm not arguing  it's just  what do you want to do  they don't know  how to support you  you don't know  if you see Patrice  give him a dollar  I guess  I mean 
[01:20:30]  Jesus  if you see me on the train  say man  why are you on the train  you gotta understand  you gotta understand  how hard it is  to be  I was trying to have  an ethic  that ethic thing  it works in terms of  I see  of having  you're like you guys  you don't  you have this show  yeah  so it's like  when you do certain things  you can promote it  but you don't  like I've been doing comedy  13 god damn years  I wanna like  kinda move 
[01:21:00]  to that level  but it's just  look  it's god damn  difficult for me  I don't know  I don't have  a MySpace account  I don't answer  every email  that somebody  sends me  you know  hey I love you  when you gonna be  in Chicago  next week  hire a Jew  I have  to do all the dirty work  for you  hire a Jew  the dumbest Jews  working for me  you'll be playing  theaters all over  the east coast  you'll get a CD out  a website  my Jews are not  good Jews  cause they know  they'll get a piece  of the action 
[01:21:30]  they'll do all the  heavy lifting  and you sit back  and just be funny  I'm gonna get another  Jew  alright listen  it's snowing out  is it  no  of course not  here in New York  here in New York  we love our snowstorms  I don't get it myself  I guess this happens  all over the country  where it does snow  the local news  goes absolutely nuts  every time it snows  and they talk to  the people out there  like they've never  seen the damn thing  before  they've never seen  snow before  they like pumping it up  making it bigger 
[01:22:00]  than it really is  the news stations  the local news stations  I don't get it  when it snows  all of a sudden  they make believe  they're talking to  people with down syndrome  they just  dumb it down  to the lowest level  and they make believe  you've never seen  this white stuff before  same stories  every time it snows  you gotta have  the reporter  where it's snowing  you gotta talk  to some people  on the roads  he or she  you gotta have  the weatherman  talking about how 
[01:22:30]  well two days ago  it looked like  we were gonna get hit  but thank god  they're always thankful  when it doesn't hit us  but you know  in reality  they hate it  because they're not  gonna be the stars  of the news  when they get  the big storms  the weather guy  is the star  of the news  that's right  and they have to  have a ruler  and just say  stupid shit  ruler's good  they gotta be  standing somewhere  where maybe  there's a snow drift  right  there's nothing worse  than a disappointing  snow storm too  when you sleep  and eight hours  there's supposed  to be a storm 
[01:23:00]  and you open  like you want to go  you want to have  that fear  like oh  that was a bad one  not even a  look at this  you do get disappointed  you're disappointed  if you have nothing  to do the next day  you know  if you have a day off  and you know  you're just hanging out  watching DVDs  you want it to snow  like a motherfucker  it's kind of cool  because it's an adventure  if you have to go out  of course  I love bad weather  I really love  a lot of rain  a lot of snow  it just gives you  an excuse to be lazy  like when it's nice  you just  you feel like 
[01:23:30]  I have to do something  I gotta get on out  of the house  but when it's snow  I love it  it's just like  well  wake up after the eight hours  they say it's gonna  be a big blizzard  and you see grass  poking up through  a little dusting  right  you just want it to be  when it was  last year  when it was having  all those storms  you just go  aww  woo  I love this  I love big  I love people  getting stuck  in their cars  you gotta keep  looking out the window  and telling whoever's there  it's accumulating  you see it out there  I just looked like  15 minutes ago 
[01:24:00]  there's another inch or two  it's amazing  how fast this is  piling up  well Nathaniel's  been watching  the local TV stations  here in New York  and they're making  a big deal  out of nothing  so we got some  examples of  the reporters  out there  in the snowstorm  let's take a look  at the parking lot  here in the  Monmouth Rust Stop  on the Garden State Parkway  where you can tell  over the past couple  of hours  that some snow  was accumulating  and in some places  it wasn't  the blacktop  being just warm enough  it seems  especially where cars  were traveling over it 
[01:24:30]  to pretty much  melt it off  that's kind of like  the way I saw it  on the Garden State Parkway  as I was driving  over here  places where you could  see plenty of blacktop  the plows  having success  the sand  and other places  where it wasn't  quite so obvious  like I said  despicable  they're talking to us  like we have  down syndrome  all of a sudden  I wonder if they  go to themselves  that fucking  mother nature 
[01:25:00]  she's screwed us again  Nathaniel  I feel like they  try to come up  with these new ways  of saying it didn't  snow that much  yeah  yeah  that's what it is  because that isn't  good  they don't want  to say that  it pains them  to have to  get on the next  day and go  well  not really  a lot of snow  in our area  so what they do  is they go  some areas  did get up to  six inches  of snow  and it's  it has nothing 
[01:25:30]  to do with the  area that  that news  is covering  they're talking  about like  Jersey by  Pennsylvania  and like  upstate New York  and Montauk Point  like some places  in our area  if our area  is like  you know  yeah  a hundred mile  radius  if the snow  stuck on the ground  it would have been  eight inches  we have a  an accumulation  bucket  that we freeze  so the snow  accumulates in the 
[01:26:00]  bucket  yes  there's eight and a  half inches  now imagine that  imagine if you  were driving  through that  shut your eyes  if you will  imagine your car  covered in snow  this morning  and they  talk like the  cars driving  on the snow  like we're lucky  that the cars  happen to be  driving on the  roads today  because that  melted the snow  nicely  well thank goodness  that's what happens  every time  now that it's  the year  2005  more audio 
[01:26:30]  in Bayville  it was about  three inches of snow  on the ground  but once you  got on the  parkway  it was really  more wet  than anything  else  but now as I'm  coming up  into Wall Township  it's starting to  stick more  so it's a little  bit more slippery  up this way  he talked about  using his  all wheel drive  and saying he  didn't think  he'd have any  problem  but you know  you can't  forget  four wheel drive  doesn't really  matter when you  hit something  slick or slippery  it doesn't help  you at all  four wheel drive  is to get  through the  snow drift  not the  snow slick  shut up 
[01:27:00]  so you could  still die  shut up  the four wheel drive  is working just  fine  shut up  yeah  yeah I think  four wheel drive  better than two  four wheel drive  no  pretty much  not a problem  call me silly  fucking assholes  they're talking  to us like  we're retarded  well now we  got the ruler  check  I know you've  all been waiting  for this to see  how we're doing  on our snow  count so  here it goes  the official ruler  of WNBC  and we're almost  up to four and a  half inches right  now so Chris is 
[01:27:30]  right on the money  when he talks  about the locally  heavy snow down  here and I guess  that's pretty much  what we're looking  at through the rest  of the morning  doesn't it sound  like he wants  to say someone  please just kill  me  just shoot me  well I had  dreams of being  a broadcaster  growing up and  now measuring  fucking snow  with a ruler  some people  some say that  in blizzard  conditions  some of the  flakes are the 
[01:28:00]  same  and we're here  to find them  and there is  such a little  dusting here we  can't actually go  through every single  snowflake  we are in the  city today  because there's so  much accumulation  ah ah look  the same  we have twin  snowflakes  but it was a  perfect recipe  for a big  snowstorm  but what we're  seeing is really  not that bad  out here in  Amityville  Long Island  take a look  behind me here  on Route 110  the roadway  conditions out  here are slick  but not that bad 
[01:28:30]  just a little  sloshy  people are  definitely  taking it easy  we found  if we could  go to the video  that we shot  just a few moments  ago  we found  Christopher  Radice  scraping his  car this morning  like most people  relieved that it  wasn't that bad  this morning  and just a few  inches of  accumulation  most roadways  they don't look  that bad out  here  again just slow  down  take it easy  it's because  municipal garages  are working overtime  to keep our  roadways safe  you know what's  looking bad  Iraq  give us some  real updates  you asshole 
[01:29:00]  yeah that looks  bad  that looks bad  that looks bad  they're spending  a lot of time  on something  that's not  going on  blizzard that  no one would  even care about  if there was  a blizzard  if there even  was  they actually  went to the  tape of a guy  scraping his  windshield  they said  scraping and  he wasn't  he was brushing  he was brushing  some flaky snow  he had a brush  you know that  type of snow  where it just  takes one quick  little brush  and you're done  like  he was drawing  wash me with  his finger 
[01:29:30]  this man is  scraping  because scraping  is when you're  out there  and it's like  zero degrees  this is how bad  the snow is  exactly  sir  what's going on  are you having  a heart attack  no I'm just  cleaning off  my car  if a flu  can take care  of the problem  it's not really  snowing  you know I gotta  wonder if she  asked him  do you have  a scraper  could you like  brush the car  off  because that 
[01:30:00]  any other  human  just looks  and goes  it just  drives away  you just  turn on your  windshield wipers  so you can  see  and you drive  away  and that snow  blows off  your car  even if it  actually did  like  happen  what  we don't  give a shit  like even if  it was the  blitz  we know  the deal  we know  the rules  there's some  salt coming  there's some  plows coming  eventually  we spoke  with the  mayor's office 
[01:30:30]  and he said  all the  plows and  salters are  ready to  roll  the plows  and salters  are ready  to roll  that's what  they do  alright good  here I'm  here outside  the sanitation  department  you see the  trucks behind  me leaving  with the  plows on  we need  day after  tomorrow  kind of  weather  right  ice age  if somebody  says hey  look  there's gonna  be 10 feet  of snow  the only way  it would matter  is if it  all fell at  once  like just  like not  flakes  10 foot  blanket 
[01:31:00]  just a 10  foot blanket  of snow  that would  be some  shit  get in the  basement  people  it's all  coming baby  right now  8 inches  of accumulation  right this  second  it's like  other than  that flakes  even if it  was 10 feet  it's like  god you make  a great point  cause even a  blizzard it's like  well alright  now it's an  inch  yeah  there it is  boy this is  creeping up  maybe an hour  goes by  oh we're up to  an inch and a  half now  and people  panic  you're so  right but if  it dumped  8 inches  right away 
[01:31:30]  right now  I'd be  fucking scared  put a snow  immediately  there ain't no  flakes baby  it's a blanket  in the 30s  or 40s  I'm sure it was  a problem  when they had  blizzards because  they didn't have  like a bunch of  snow plows  and things  and the salting  machines  now even a  blizzard  the streets  are plowed  you don't have to  stock up on  food  you can get out  of your house  that day  later in the  day  and they start  at 5  if the blizzards  come in at 10  they start 
[01:32:00]  that's how you  know this  they knew this  wasn't going to be  one  because those  things start  and they're just  pushing snow  and snow  never accumulates  in New York  because there's  never not traffic  to drive over the  snow  it's hitting the  tops of the cars  and where it's  hitting in between  the cars  the cars are  running it over  anyway  we're trying to  be scared  it comes in so  slow that you  have plenty of  time to take  care of everything  you might need  just like the  hurricane thing  hurricanes come in  so slow 
[01:32:30]  you've got plenty  of time to  figure it out  for you and  your family  it's not like  a tornado  the tornado  like all of a  sudden there's a  thunderstorm  the shit comes  out of the sky  blam  eats your farm  up  and then it's  gone  now that's  scary weather  that's scary  weather  but there's  nothing that a  blizzard would  do  let's say  20 feet of  snow  if you're in  your house  and everything's  cool  20 feet of  snow  you would not  be afraid  of 20 feet  you'd look and 
[01:33:00]  go wow man  there's snow  outside my  window  but all you're  really concerned  about is cable  cutting off  that's it  that's it  there's no  fear to snow  sorry  there's nothing  we have here  that relates  to anything  that happens  to some of  these crackers  in tornado  alley  a great way  to look at  it  like a tornado  if you put  it to music  it would be  like Metallica  or something  just something  just like  crazy  but a snow  storm 
[01:33:30]  what kind  of music  would you  put to  you know  all the  weather  outside  but the  fire  is  so  Christmas  music  snow music  is not  like  watch out  oh yeah  woo  none of that  it's like  exactly  but a tornado  it's all  about Metallica  yeah  it even 
[01:34:00]  sounds like  snowfall  people love  when it snows  it's beautiful  it's not  something scary  especially on  Christmas  around Christmas  people are like  oh it's  snowing  people enjoy  snow  it's not like  oh it's  you know  a Halloween  tornado  people are  happy  how scary  can it be  if there's  songs called  like  let it snow  let it snow  let it snow  if little tornadoes  came down in flakes  if tornadoes were in flakes  it might be  you know what I mean  like oh  little burst of wind  it's just coming down  if tornadoes are coming 
[01:34:30]  you're not singing a song  let it blow  let it blow  you know what I mean  oh  oh my trailer  is not  screwed down  they're saying  let it snow  let it snow  that's how scary  snow is  let it snow  I'll say it  three times  even wait  somewhere over  here's snow music  don't try to scare us  news  you can see the snow  falling in this song 
[01:35:00]  oh the weather outside  is frightful  oh it's frightful  but I'll  the fire is so  the fire is delightful  the fire is delightful  the fire is delightful  same song for a tornado  oh the weather outside  is frightful  oh my god  and this is a white guy  on vacation  doesn't show signs of stopping  doesn't show signs of stopping  brought some corn  and I brought some corn  for popping  the lights are  couldn't sound more relaxed  no  he's falling asleep  let it snow 
[01:35:30]  let it snow  let it snow  but sir  it is going to be  twelve inches  I don't fucking care  Patrice  how I'll hate  going out in the storm  but if you really  hold me tight  just a hug  all the way home  I'll be warm  doesn't matter  the fire is slowly dying  and my dear will see  but if I wish you found me so 
[01:36:00]  let it snow  let it snow  let us have 350 mile an hour winds  even the only tornado song  that was peaceful  somewhere over the rainbow  that was  that picked her up  and let her down  real nice  that's snow  that's snow music right there  hell yeah  alright we got more audio here  let's go to the next one  this is a female reporter 
[01:36:30]  now people we spoke with  getting their morning coffee  this morning  say they have mixed emotions  about all of this snow  I really don't think it was bad  as everybody reported  so I'm kind of happy  to be honest with you  because at least this way  I can go get my job done today  and we can get through the streets  so it's really not that bad  what do the roadways look like  oh they're not bad  I thought it was going to be a lot worse  so I got to go into Queens now  hopefully it's a lot better in there  yeah  they're a motion sound mix  well the best part is  they're all saying  I thought it was going to be a lot worse 
[01:37:00]  no one thought it was going to be a lot worse  because of the stupid news  and their fear crap  thought it was going to be worse  but no  nothing  if they didn't report that  it was going to be stormed  even if it wasn't that thing  that blocks out the TV  and goes  turn the channel  I got on my thing  turn the channel 35  because it's going to be  a severe winter weather storm  when it starts to go on the bottom  yeah  if they didn't do that  and you woke up to a surprise blizzard  yeah  you wouldn't know not what to do  you wouldn't go  oh no  stay down  how the fuck do I get through this  well I gotta put on my other hat 
[01:37:30]  it's like  you know what to do  you don't even report a big blizzard  so true  and again what we're seeing  is a steady kind of snow  and Eddie if you can stay with me  or I want to show you  the accumulation out here  with my notebook  I don't have a ruler like Brian does  but it's just a few inches  that we're seeing out here  right now as we speak  and again mixed emotions  people love it or they hate it  by the way  back to you in the studio  we watched that clip  as she's saying it's just a few inches  it was barely an inch  barely an inch of dusting  and she took her notebook 
[01:38:00]  and just kind of went  whoosh whoosh  she sounded like she was removing her clothing  as it was  alright well I had this little scarf on  but my neck is sweating y'all  oh it's getting hot  and she tells the cameraman  if you can stay with me  yeah through the blizzard like winds  it's nothing happening  gotta love the camera guys  they've seen it all  they're like stay with you  Jesus  are you kidding me  stay with you  don't worry about it  I shot footage of NOM  this is nothing  and Darlene  I know you understand this  my hair is completely wet  just stepping out here  for a few minutes  that's the kind of snow 
[01:38:30]  that we're experiencing  it's that slick  kind of slushy kind of snow  yeah  it's a bit of a mess  but you know what  we were saying earlier  you look absolutely beautiful  aww Darlene  I can always count on you  to make me feel good  oh shut up  this is why we do  the assaults on the media  polls even in the news  they stink  she's talking about  her hair getting wet  from the snow  if you can look  that's the worst thing  she could find  right  she tried with the notebook  that wasn't really working  she wasn't showing  the potential for danger  or anything 
[01:39:00]  the most dangerous thing  she could find  is that if you go out in this  yeah  your hair is going to get  a little wet  that's it  why is not that bad news  yeah  it's not that bad  well  then they shouldn't  even have reported it  yeah  because they hyped it  a little bit too much  beforehand  so now they gotta go on  and go  ah  we're here  but it really  nothing like we said it  what do you got on Fox here  this slushy av  not ocean av  she just makes a terrible joke  you could probably stop it  right after the joke  oh  hi Chris 
[01:39:30]  well drivers tell us  you know what  this isn't too bad  maybe I'm the baby  I'm the sissy  in all of this  but they tell us  it isn't too bad  and the plow truck drivers  they've been doing a good job  clearing this road  this is ocean avenue  it looks more like  slushy avenue  out here in seabright  hey how you doing  they're honking at us  everyone is pretty much  taking their time  and drivers tell us  they hope  everyone does that  for the rest of the day  because the snow  is still falling  now you know what  I think this time around  the driver's gonna  you know  try to go 100 miles an hour 
[01:40:00]  yeah  I think they finally had it  and they're gonna see  what their car could do  in this mess  let's just  open it up  on the icy road  of course  they're gonna take their time  it's still falling  and it started coming down  right around midnight  over here  on the coastal areas  residents tell us  the town's snowplows  have been doing a good job  clearing the side streets  the highways as well  looking pretty good as well  our drive down here  was pretty smooth  the state's transportation department  actually has more than  300 snowplows 
[01:40:30]  carrying salt and sand  and that's just  for the turnpike  there are one  rush hour  could be a mess  we'll keep you informed  no it isn't  it isn't a mess  sorry  sorry we panicked you  there you go  it's just another bust  I love that  let it snow  let it snow  no one cares  you know what  the today show  could go fuck themselves  wow  this is why  we have no respect 
[01:41:00]  for the media  whatsoever  because they don't get  anything right  nothing  yeah we'll get them  we'll get them  after the commercial  this was on the  today show  just a little while ago  well on January 9th  Stern will become  the first shock jock  in space  when he takes  his sophomoric  schtick  to Sirius satellite radio  with only  hey you cunt  what are we  wicker  you motherfucker  well you know what  I guess it's time  to start assaulting  the today show again 
[01:41:30]  yeah  it's time to assault  the today show  it's time to maybe  inform  Katie  that we've been here  over a year  yeah  how about that  eh  over a year  this is what the media  does all the time  they don't like us  they're not happy  with us  nope  we've  we've pulled some  of our shenanigans  and  always the bastards  and made them look  silly a few times  our most famous one  was when a girl  flashed her  her breasts 
[01:42:00]  on the today show  live  became an international  story  they know about us  how about now  gash  and uh  you know  we weren't a tiny  little radio show  when we were on  commercial radio  we were syndicated  we were doing well  we were getting  you know  national headlines  international headlines  and it's uh  everyone knows  we're the first ones  to come to satellite radio  no respect  everyone knows that  we've been here  a year and three months  i don't  you know  but they just go on  the air and just  blatantly lie  blatantly lie  about this  only eight shows 
[01:42:30]  left on his  terrestrial radio show  howard's been getting  surprisingly sentimental  it has been a  spectacular 20 years  radio's raunchiest  dj even apologized  recently to his  audience for what  he called 10 years  of subpar  broadcast  laying the blame  squarely at the  feet of the federal  communications commission  yeah  just proving that  you can't do a  radio show  unless you're being  dirty howard  yeah  that's it  10 years  wow  apologize  waddle doodle 
[01:43:00]  i apologize  he's blaming  the fcc  on 10 years  of bad radio  and coincidentally  the last 10 years  is when anthony  and i  became  massive radio  stars  yeah  under the same  rules  and under the same  eyes of  the federal  communications  we had no  problems  right up until  they threw  our asses  and we  and we also  got  we also got  fined and all  that but we  had to adjust  and guess what  we became very  very popular in the  last 10 years as  howard is admitting  that he couldn't do  a show under those  conditions 
[01:43:30]  it's gonna stink on  satellite radio  and fucking the  today show  we're the first to do  it everyone knows it  for them to blatantly  lie like that  payback's gonna be a  bitch  yeah you watch  have fun  bitches  he's the army  you know  they got a lot of  projects they're  working on but  the money  they're paying him  is it from  who they  automatically believe  that everybody's  gonna just come  that's part of it  I'm sure  do they think  do they  already know 
[01:44:00]  that it might not  be as many  whatever  that and commercials  no one can figure  out how it's a good  deal for that  company  no one  no one on wall  street can figure  it out  no one can figure  out how they're  gonna make money  it's anticipated  though money  it has to be  right  yeah it's not  guaranteed  the reality is  too there's more  people that  will not get  satellite radio  because he's over  there  you know what I  mean  it's a whole  clusterfuck  there are people  that will now  buy XM because  he's going over  there  that's a fact  that's just how 
[01:44:30]  it works  yeah  why is that  no one can figure  out how this is a  good deal for  them  that's a good  deal for the  industry though  why is that  why is that  more people buy  XM because  he's going to  series  because XM has  the better  programming  in general  and then you  know that could  be the turnoff  you know  there was a  what was the  car maker  that's decided  oh I see what  you're saying  like he's  leaving so  like ah you  know what  if I'm going to  go to satellite  I'm just going  to go to XM  I'm going to go to  XM  oh I see what you're  saying okay  but just a note  for the past 
[01:45:00]  and the ONA  army  keep the Today  Show on your  radar  I know you're  working on some  big projects now  but when you're  ready I think  they need to  realize that we  were the first  to come to  satellite radio  teach them a  lesson  a nice old  lesson  oh we'll teach  them a lesson  no problem  oh no problem  the media in  general is very  very scared of  this radio show  you'll see  oh you'll see  you'll see  now when you  let off the hook  and like Katie  Kirk gets on  and goes  oh yesterday  we forgot to  acknowledge that  we have a 
[01:45:30]  correction  oh Nate was  the first one  we have a  correction  dude it's just  lying  call your people  off fellas  thanks  it's just  lying through  your teeth  this isn't  like a gray  area like  wow are Opie  and Anthony  shock jocks  were they popular  on commercial  radio  we were a  high profile  show on  commercial radio  that did  quote shocking  things  you know  and we made  headlines  all the stuff  that Howard's  going through  right now  to some extent  we did all  those same  interviews  said the  same shit  we were in  the magazines  we were on  the TV 
[01:46:00]  Mr. O  Mr. A  can you do  me a favor  could you  have some  of your  listeners  stop pressing  their ass  asses against  the window  in the morning  it's really  hard to do  the news  we can't be  serious with  an ass  cheek  we're going  to have a  special project  for the  today show  there's going  to be a  special project  for the  today show  oh man  oh yeah  we don't  we don't  mess around  we don't  miss a  thing  we were  the first  a year  and three  months ago 
[01:46:30]  everyone was  admitting we  were the  first ones  to satellite  radio  that's why  we start  our show  almost every  morning saying  you're listening  to the pioneers  of satellite  radio  well  Doug you're  listening right  there's some  attack when you  can  there are some  nude butt cheeks  coming forth  that's great  Anthony with all  the Christmas  songs playing  and all the  snow are a  bunch of  white guys  finally waking  up in New  York City  hospitals  that's right  if you got  asked for 
[01:47:00]  directions in  July on the  street if you  were a tourist  maybe just some  poor white guy  and you went  and some guy  came up to you  and said yo  man which way  is north and  you turned and  pointed you  should just be  regaining  consciousness right  now is that a  true story or is  that some  damn  well no that  is somebody that  was asked for  directions and  was mugged  and we kind of  went off and we  did it during the  summer that if  that happens if  you're walking  down the street  and someone asks  for directions  I usually just 
[01:47:30]  act like a  lunatic like I'll  be walking and  someone goes  excuse me  excuse me I'll  go I'll go  don't even  like and throw  my arms up and  keep walking  realize that  robbing somebody  like that is  almost like  tapping somebody  on the right  shoulder  and being on  the left  that's how  no it always  starts with a  conversation  it always starts  with hey man  you know what  time it is and  then while you  look at your  watch all of a  sudden everything  goes black and 
[01:48:00]  then your family  is around you and  you hear  and you don't  know what  happened you  like wait  what wasn't it  just 90 degrees  and why is it  snowing out  here's what  you do all you  have to do to  not get robbed  or somebody  is act like you  know what the  hell you're  talking about  or make it  quick I don't  know or  but don't  scratch your  head and try  to help too  much  right but I  don't even take  that chance I  just go I  don't I don't  even I throw 
[01:48:30]  my hands up I  don't even I  I know what  you're all about  but then that  makes me want to  rob you because  it's like this  fucking asshole  no because  there's an easy  market lazy  motherfuckers they  don't want to  like like chase  me down or  try to get into  my psyche  they'll find some  room that goes  well I don't  know I'm new to  the city here  and pop  that's  jingle bell  jingle bell  jingle bell  rock  oh here it is  here it is  I have an  example  oh you do  let's see  yeah which

[01:51:30]  some of the  audio  is very  very entertaining  as we go  to break  Dennis Leary  was in here  very recently  and he did  a Christmas  special for  Comedy Central  very very funny  very dark  very edgy  got away  with a lot  of stuff  and we got  a little taste  of the show  he did  for Comedy Central  his opening  monologue  Merry Christmas  tonight we celebrate  the birth  of the baby  Jesus  whose mom  Mary  just happens  to have been  a virgin  even apparently  after she gave  birth to Jesus  at least that's  what the Catholic  Church would have 
[01:52:00]  you believe  you know  Tom Cruise  takes a lot  of shit  for belonging  to a religion  Scientology  that believes  aliens came  to this planet  75 million years  ago  that's nothing  I was raised  Catholic  we believe  Mary was a virgin  and that Jesus  ended up walking  on water  creating a bottomless  jug of wine  and rising from  the dead  oh yeah  and Tom Cruise  is crazy  yeah  okay  listen  Christmas is built  on a line  of bullshit  okay  do I believe  there was a baby  Jesus  you bet your ass  I do  but I also believe  about nine months  before he was born  somebody sure as shit  banged the hell  out of his mom  oh yeah 
[01:52:30]  and Santa Claus  well more bullshit  let me get this  straight  a big fat guy  comes to your house  and leaves you toys  that he and his  little helpers made  just for you  and all he asks for  is a couple of cookies  and a glass of milk  yeah  okay  he sees you  when you're sleeping  and he knows  when you're awake  alright  he's either a pedophile  or he's with FEMA  alright  and if he's with FEMA  he's not showing up  until January 2nd  anyway  so  you know 
[01:53:00]  they lie to us  right from the get go  and then when we're 12  and we find out the truth  Easter Bunny lie  Tooth Fairy lie  Santa Claus  big lie  then they wonder  why we start lying  right back to him  okay  I'm not drunk  I don't do drugs  I promise I'll pull out  yeah  big lies  big lies  there's big lies  there's small lies  there's white lies  there's black lies  a white lie  being when Scooter Libby  says Dick Cheney  didn't tell me what to say  and a black lie  is when a brother  says I didn't see  who shot Chug Knight 
[01:53:30]  even though he's  sitting right next to him  at the party  they're all the same folks  they're all lies  so what did I tell my kids  about the baby Jesus  and his mom  and Santa Claus  that same bunch of bullshit  my parents told me  why should my kids  get off easy  okay  I want them to experience  the same joy  and cheer  and happiness  I felt as a little kid  and then the crushing blow  of disappointment  and pain and anger  that comes with getting older  yes  oh yeah  oh yeah  because in the end  all of us know 
[01:54:00]  that's what Christmas  is really about  a pinch of joy  a pound of pain  a scoop of hatred  and a dollop of rage  okay  throwing a little booze  and some relatives  you can't stand the sight of  but you have to invite over anyways  and you've got yourself  a holiday recipe  chock full of disaster  and don't forget  take pictures  you're going to need them  for the court case  ladies and gentlemen  here they come  here we go  what the fuck is that

[02:06:30]  You condensate  On these walls  And at the end of my loss  Suddenly I'm free  Again  I'm torn to the fire  Falling from the stars 
[02:07:00]  Falling under the sound of your voice  Falling under the sound of your voice  There's a taste of Kairos. 
[02:07:30]  All right.  And Saturate.  What do you think, Anthony?  Anthony's been in bands his whole life.  Let's see what Anthony has to say.  I think they're pretty good.  I like the, man, a lot of production in that.  You guys spent a lot of time in the studio, huh?  Actually, two weeks.  That's it?  Two weeks.  That's all we had.  Jesus.  Not bad.  Goddamn modern equipment. 
[02:08:00]  Try doing it on tape, you bastards.  Goddamn computers.  Great.  Pro Tools.  Goddamn Pro Tools.  A lot of practice, 18-hour days, and Pro Tools.  That's what it was.  18-hour days.  All right.  Definitely lost our equipment as well.  Anything over four.  My equipment got stolen on the way to the studio.  We flew out to California because we knew a guy out there.  All my guitar stuff got stolen on the way.  That blows.  That's got to happen to every band.  So everything was borrowed.  All right.  Well, you've got the big night tonight in Pittsburgh opening up for Bon Jovi. 
[02:08:30]  Heck yeah.  Oh, we've got another publicity shot of you guys.  How's this one?  Char is leaning her head on her man.  She's wearing a tie, man.  Oh, how about you?  Char.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, that guy on the left, the guy on the left, man.  Listen, Char, don't cock block his hoopie stage.  Because this guy really...  Like, the one on the right looks like he tried to be cool.  Yeah.  Hey, that's me.  Jesus.  Is that you? 
[02:09:00]  Patrice?  Yeah, I'm on the right.  With the goddamn fake fan that blows the coat and the hair to the side.  But the guy on the left needs some pussy.  Don't blow it for him by being all, don't do that to women.  Don't belittle women.  Let him belittle some women.  Get him on some ass.  This guy's going bald, a balding rock and roll star.  Give this guy a break.  When he's getting some ass, you two lovers...  These are our new friends, Kairos.  I'm just saying, don't ruin his good rock and roll time, okay?  If these guys blow up. 
[02:09:30]  I'll do my best.  These guys blow up huge.  They're never going to be on our show again because of nasty things that Patrice was saying.  No, I'm just saying.  Yeah, we don't know Patrice.  He's just a comic that's promoting a gig.  The two lovebirds don't ruin the balding guy on the left's ride.  I hope he's fucked up our relationship with Godsmack before they made it.  I don't want that to happen again.  Let me tell you a little story about Godsmack.  All right, listen.  But we love Godsmack. 
[02:10:00]  We're big fans of theirs.  Sonny Ferrelli is loving it.  He says, not bad.  I laughed.  I cried.  I shit my pants.  So it's a whirlwind of emotion.  I laughed and cried.  I shit my pants.  No, people are liking it.  So was that good?  I couldn't...  You know, I'm not even trying to be funny.  I couldn't...  It sounded good to me.  He's a black guy.  I understand.  He can't really understand that kind of music.  But you know how people who are real fans of rock and roll, they go, nah, that was that.  No, it's all right.  Was it good?  I saw some woman, some black woman comic at the Apollo commenting, and this is going back a few years, 
[02:10:30]  on how white people don't understand hip-hop music.  And then she goes into this tirade about Nirvana and talking about how that music is just the worst.  And she's trying to, I don't know, make fun of it.  She picked the wrong group.  She absolutely picked the wrong fucking group.  That's what I'm saying.  Like, she had no clue.  You don't cross racism.  Right.  Just stick to what white people don't know about you, but don't dip into white... 
[02:11:00]  Don't try to dip in.  Because I might have tried to have been funny and go, ah, that was I.  But you don't know.  I really don't know.  And I'm not going to try to dip into hip-hop and tell you this shit sucks or this is great stuff or that,  because I'll just end up looking stupid.  Right.  Right.  And I can go, no, that sounds good.  Stick to your racism.  It was haunting.  Can I say that?  Haunting.  Haunting.  That is good.  It was haunting.  That's all right.  Is that good?  That's good, right?  I think that's a compliment.  How long is that song?  Yeah.  How many minutes?  Five minutes?  Six minutes. 
[02:11:30]  Oh, six minutes?  Right under there.  One of the short ones.  All right.  Well, guys, what are we promoting today?  Obviously, the gig in Pittsburgh with Bon Jovi, but what about a website or something?  KairosBand.com.  KairosBand.com.  And, well, you got, I don't know, man.  If you're going to be giving out that plug, no one knows how to spell Kairos.  K-A-I-R-O-S, Band.  Okay.  And also, you're on MySpace?  We are.  Everyone.  MySpace.com backslash Kairos7. 
[02:12:00]  It's just a slash.  And look, and make sure my best wishes.  I hear that so many times when I listen to the radio.  It's just a slash.  That's the slash.  We just know it's a slash.  My best wishes to the guy in a band that looks like one of the hobbits from, and also the star of Lost.  What's that guy's name?  He's the drummer.  Oh, I don't know.  One of the guys from Lord of the Rings, and he's in Lost.  He stars in Lost.  He's that guy.  He looks like that guy.  The drummer. 
[02:12:30]  My best wishes to him.  And Sharp.  Good luck to the group for him.  Sharp, who do you look like?  I don't know.  I don't know that anyone's ever asked me that before.  Why'd you steal Avril Lavigne's tie?  That is the first time and the only time I've ever worn a tie.  Really?  Yeah.  But who do people think you look like?  Honestly, I don't know.  Well, I guess I do kind of look like Avril Lavigne in that picture. 
[02:13:00]  Very good.  Okay.  Well, good luck to you guys.  Thank you.  Yeah, have fun, man.  Enjoy the experience tonight.  It's going to be great for you guys.  Yeah, we're going to have a blast.  All right, cool.  There they go.  Kairos, our new friends.  Hey, let us know how it goes tomorrow.  Yes, sir.  All right, we will.  All right, yeah.  Give us a quick call tomorrow.  All right, cool.  All right, there they go.  Kairos.  All right.  Kairos.  So, was it a good song?  I think it's a hook.  Maybe it was a...  Well, I think the type of music they do isn't like that, you know, chorus, verse, chorus, 
[02:13:30]  kind of...  I think the hook was coming.  Chorus, chorus, verse, kind of, you know, the hook and then the rest of the song and  repeat it another time.  It's like all over kind of the place, man.  Like Pink Floyd, I think they said, compared to bands like Pink Floyd.  I heard a little Perfect Circle in there.  A little bit.  Yeah, there was something else with the...  A little bit.  A little bit.  The vocals sounded a little familiar, but...  I was just talking about the rock and roll.  That's just like positive rappers, like Christian rappers.  Oof.  He's like, yo, give it up for God, baby. 
[02:14:00]  Oh, no.  Bring on the hoes.  Keeping it real for Jesus.  It's like rock and roll bands to me.  Keeping it real for Jesus.  Jesus is off the hook.  I hate that shit.  And it's like these rock and roll bands who are like...  These yodely...  I just can't...  I really was into Kurt Cobain.  That was a bad dude to me.  And it's like some of these groups...  But this yodely positivity thing where... 
[02:14:30]  You know these serious rock groups that don't do anything wrong.  If I pop on K-Rock now or something, and I'm listening, I go, my God, I cannot tell you  what band this is based on who it sounds like.  You know, I know because I just kind of know.  Yeah.  But the sound...  It's so hard to come up with an original sound to a band and make it.  You know?  You could kind of be copies of other bands, and the vocalist sounds the same, or your music 
[02:15:00]  is kind of the same, and get through and get picked up, get signed, go on tour, whatever.  But something like a Nirvana, where out of the blue you just come out, and it's such  a completely different fucking sound, and you just go through the roof.  I want to take...  So many bands on Ethel that sound like Nirvana.  I'm going to go on a limb and say this.  That right now, rock and roll music, white people's music, is in a bad way, and I'm going  to tell you why.  Yeah.  Because I knew about Nirvana.  Nirvana stepped over...  Kurt Cobain and them stepped into my life. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  That's how big they were and how good they were.  But these goofy...  You guys were wearing the flannels in the hood?  His music was so good that people just knew who Kurt Cobain was.  Yeah.  But there's not one of these goofy groups now.  Like, I didn't realize Green Day was still...  I turned on something, and Green Day's winning an award for this.  I'm like, what?  They kind of went away for a little while.  Not totally away, but...  And then they just came back huge.  Yeah, this last album was just a monster for them. 
[02:16:00]  The funny thing about Green Day...  What are you guys talking about now?  Green Day.  What are white guys talking about?  No, I'm not...  Oh, music-wise?  Music-wise.  What's your thing now?  It's just...  It's all over the place.  It really is.  There's no real...  I mean, you've got the standouts like U2 and things like that.  What is it?  Thank you.  Rat right now is still playing.  White Stripes has a new album coming out.  It's still for style.  White Stripes is still drinking.  White Stripes is one of my favorite bands.  What are they into?  They're unbelievable.  Like, you know, Nirvana was into...  I'm saying Nirvana was into a nice fuck-the-world kind of thing. 
[02:16:30]  Alkaline Trio.  Yeah, there's really not a theme, like a fuck-the-world grunge-type theme.  It's not a band really just taking the lead right now.  I hate any of those bands that are like,  I got up for work this morning, and I didn't like it.  It's any fucking of the 20 bands that sound like that.  My girlfriend broke up with me at the mall today.  It's hard being poor and stupid.  Today, it's hard being poor and stupid. 
[02:17:00]  Like, all right, we get it.  My parents don't understand me.  Oh, fuck you.  Shut up.  And how many...  There's either one that has a thousand songs out,  or there's a thousand band one-hit wonders.  I can't tell.  I don't think there's a parent out there that understands their kids.  Oh, God.  Let's stop singing about that.  Popped in my old car, picked up my friends.  There was a sound for a minute I liked where...  What was the one where the kid was walking on the beach?  And he sounds like this. 
[02:17:30]  Like, you know the...  What?  Wow.  How old are you going?  It's a bittersweet symphony.  Oh, that one.  The one with the cranberries.  You remember the cranberries?  Linger?  Or...  Zombie?  What's the one that...  Zombie, zombie.  It was in every white movie.  Hey, get my...  That sound for like a second. 
[02:18:00]  There's something in there that relates to what we're talking about.  It was a sound.  That yodeling sound for like a quick...  It was the cranberries thing.  That little yodeling thing and that little creepy kind of high voice.  For a second, that was the thing for like a quick, you know, this song.  I think he's talking about...  This is Linger.  I think he's talking about Zombie by the cranberries.  It was about the war. 
[02:18:30]  What?  Fighting?  Fighting.  Ha, ha.  Yeah, yeah.  It's the theme song for all of those...  Those...  Those love...  I think this is it.  This could be.  What do I got?  I got some cool here.  Music back then.  Wait, here it is.  Oh, wait.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  Here it is.  Right here.  I got it. 
[02:19:00]  I got it.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Oh, my love.  Da, da, da, da, da, da.  Oh.  I turned this totally down for a second.  I don't know the word, but it...  Oh, da, da.  Yeah, yeah.  Da, da, da, da, da.  You know what that is?  Let me punch.  I know.  I know.  It's ringing.  I'm going to instant feedback.  You're absolutely right.  It's in every. 
[02:19:30]  Oh, oh.  Oh, oh.  Yeah.  That song right here.  That's it right there.  That sound was the shit for like, I don't know why.  What is that?  How does a black man know about this?  Wow.  How does it know that?  Oh.  Oh.  This is some underground white shit for you.  For you and a black guy to know.  It's in every one of these, like, you know.  You're absolutely right.  You know.  Angelica Houston as the mother. 
[02:20:00]  John Cryer as the...  Starring Kate Hudson.  Starring Colin Farrell.  It's a visit.  This is it, baby.  That's the song.  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah, this was...  That was the...  Every one of those movies is, that's the song right there.  Whatever.  You know, um...  He's from Seattle.  She's from Upper Wyoming. 
[02:20:30]  They get together in this love story that's unpredictable.  Oh, no.  God damn it.  You hit that one.  Oh, jeez.  You know what?  Give Dirk this list so we can do this after the break.  One of the men's magazines did an article on the most annoying songs ever.  Annoying?  The most annoying songs ever.  Are they annoying?  Or can some of them be, uh, like guilty pleasure?  Um, yeah.  Well, yeah. 
[02:21:00]  Most of them are very annoying.  Because I gotta tell you.  To this day.  Yeah.  This is what?  2006 we're heading toward.  Almost 2006.  We're a month away.  Yeah.  I will not turn off Wang Chung.  I will not turn off everybody have fun tonight.  Everybody have fun tonight.  If I'm driving and I hit that goddamn 80s channel on XM and that goddamn Wang Chung song,  it gets turned up and I get a smile and it's a happy song. 
[02:21:30]  Oh, here it is.  Oh, look at it.  There's no turning this off.  Look, you just smiled.  What makes you happier, this song or a puggle?  Oh, wow.  That's a tough one.  Wow.  That's rough, but I'll hold a puggle.  While listening to this song.  And he'll lick my face.  All's good with the world.  This song's on the radio.  Hey.  There's nothing wrong with the world. 
[02:22:00]  Right.  You're in traffic.  I don't care.  What are you listening to?  Because it's not Wang Chung.  You're obviously angry.  All of a sudden, the construction workers are dancing on the sidewalk.  Why not?  Why not?  And why not?  And it's choreographed.  All is right with the world.  All of a sudden, the meter maid puts down her pen and pad.  She's got to dance a little.  There will not be.  That's great.  Tickets today.  One of those videos where it starts off with one person and then a lot of people stop following you. 
[02:22:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Right.  And everyone's caught up in it.  All types of sizes.  How do you not like this?  Even the dirty A-Rab in his cab is having a good time with this song.  He's dancing with a Jew.  They love each other.  This makes me want to sell my guns when I hear this.  There you go.  Very good.  The world is a happy place.  It's telling everybody to have fun. 
[02:23:00]  And you do.  We have another song that people will follow you if they hear it.  Uh-huh.  Oh, this is the one Anthony mentioned earlier, right?  It is?  Oh, the safety dance.  What a horrid song.  You can dance if you're one who you're going to leave the world behind.  What was the name of this guy?  Men Without Hats.  Oh, it was Men Without Hats.  Right.  I thought it was a guy.  And their follow-up song was...  And their follow-up was that one song that... 
[02:23:30]  Oh, that's right.  Yeah, Pop Goes the World.  That's in the category of songs that never, ever would have gotten anywhere without MTV.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  All right, where's that list?  We should do it real fast.  I just gave it to Derek so he can play some of these songs.  We got a break?  We're rocking, man.  Take a break.  Hey, Ben, you take a break. 
[02:24:00]  I'm not taking no break.  Break a break, you.  I guess we're selling some commercials, huh?  Finally.  Hey, look at us.  I don't know what goes on when...  Hoo-hoo, 20 minutes of commercials.  That's right, Robin.  Where's my Boy Scout uniform?  Let's see.  Oh, and we're going to have more tryouts for tissue time, by the way.  Any women want to talk dirty today and do some phone section, you've got to give us a call.  We've got to do one before we get out of here today, okay?  Right.  A lot of people are requesting the old tissue time bit. 
[02:24:30]  Nathaniel?  Everything's great.  Why is everyone running around panicking?  They're writing notes?  They do that to look busy.  Really?  Like, there are some post-its that just say, like, post-it on it.  So they just write things.  Patrice, speaking of music, did we play Gangsta Fag for you yet?  No.  Oh, my God.  God, not Gangsta Fag.  Do we got stuff for you?  I didn't hear Gangsta Fag.  Do we have time to play a little Gangsta Fag, at least?  I'm finally getting my XM radio turned on so I can goddamn know what the hell's going on these days. 
[02:25:00]  Look at the post-it fan just posted for me.  Yeah.  You're right.  He says, you're right.  What an ass.  All right, we'll take a break.  Make Ben happy.  Ah.  When we get back, this is what happens.  We're going to do the most annoying songs of all time.  We're going to do Gangsta Fag.  I bet I like the annoying songs, deep down.  I won't admit to all of them, but a couple I'll probably admit to.  Ah, there is a band on there that you absolutely love.  The reason they're annoying is because they get stuck in your head and they're catchy, probably. 
[02:25:30]  Right.  Oh, there's one in there that I love?  Oh, yeah.  Is that a tease?  Yes.  Wow.  Yes, that's a tease, Anthony.  And what else are we going to do?  Oh, yeah, and then we're looking for the really hot-sounding girls.  Mm-hmm.  To call in to do Tissue Time.  Right.  We're still looking for our new hit bit.  Yeah, the perfect person to do Tissue Time.  And we got some dude with Tourette's that wants to do comedy before we get out of here, right?  Is he almost ready?  Yes.  Shit, how are we going to get all this in?  We finally decided at 9.30 to do a radio show? 
[02:26:00]  Cock full of bits.  This is the stupidest job ever.  I got to finally admit it to everybody.  You just come in here and make shit up and you get paid boatloads of money.  And you know what's funny?  That there is a person.  Because, you know, you listen to the radio and you get excited about things and he goes,  man, what the fuck are they talking?  What happened to the bear hunting?  Yeah.  Like there's somebody going to go, what's the name of your bear?  They're going to talk about the bear hunt.  You never got to it.  Nigga got into an annoying song. 
[02:26:30]  You let that goddamn nigga sidetrack you with cranberry?  We want to know about bears, nigga.  Bands.  But hearing a big black dude talking about the cranberries, that's priceless, man.  Just trying to figure out what the fuck you were talking about.  You know it's the song that I'm like.  That's like us coming in here and trying to tell you that we discovered this great new  rap guy named Jay-Z. 
[02:27:00]  Or just trying to go, you know what song it is, Patrice.  It's the one where the guy goes, I don't know the words, but it's...  Wait a minute, but then I go, oh, I know that one.  Oh, I know that one.  That's called choke this hoe.  Yeah, that's number six.  Choke this hoe.  Because y'all knew the cranberries.  You go, oh, I knew it.  He started playing the shit.  Listen, boys, Sharon really needs to get on the air.  Sharon from Pennsylvania, what's up?  Hey, I have to thank you guys, first of all.  The way home from the gym yesterday, I was listening to the most original skit ever. 
[02:27:30]  Thank you.  Beth and Allison.  Yes.  You guys are brilliant for coming up with that one.  Thank you.  Of course you're talking about tissue time.  Of course.  Ah, yes.  Yes.  And it sounds like you got very horny yesterday listening to that?  Absolutely.  You did.  I did.  And my husband was in the car with me, and I told him, holy ass, this is getting horny right  now.  And went home, took a shower, banged the heck out of him. 
[02:28:00]  Thank you, tissue time.  Look at that.  There you go.  Tissue time.  We're getting couples together.  It's a hit.  Getting couples together.  Well, before the end of the show, we're going to have more tissue time.  Maybe with Michelle, if she's listening today, or maybe with a new broad.  That's what we do.  Oh.  Maybe with a new broad.  New broad.  Thank you, Sharon.  All right.  Take it easy.  Thanks a lot, guys.  All right.  We're going to do this, and then when we come back, we're going to do something else.  Like sands through the hourglass, so is the O&A virus. 
[02:28:30]  I'm reading the papers today.  Billy Joel got out of rehab again.  Yeah.  I couldn't shake the Chardonnay.  So for all you people living on Long Island, you might want to build fences around your houses.  Yeah.  He's back.  Because he's back, ready to rock and roll again, right into your house.  Ah, there you go.  See?  Even his songs include wine.  Yeah.  Well, you admit it in the paper.  Where's my stuff today? 
[02:29:00]  Bear with me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's right.  How about all three of them, Billy?  Sure.  While you're driving around Long Island.  Yeah.  Crashing into some old lady's house.  That is one of the best stories ever.  There she goes, Billy.  A bottle of wine. 
[02:29:30]  It all depends upon your appetite.  I'll treat you any time you want.  Through the wall of my Italian.  They'll meet you at an Italian restaurant if you can get there. 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, but in the paper today, it says he'll stick to women and songs.  A just rehab Billy Joel got a welcome home smooch from his wife, Kate Lee, in New York.  Sunday, he left the Betty Ford Center where the piano man said he beat his weakness for wine. 
[02:30:30]  Things are okay with me.  Things are okay with me these days.  I've got a good job.  I've got a good office.  I've got a new wife.  I've got a new life.  And the family is fine.  Oh, I can't breathe. 
[02:31:00]  It kind of worked, though.  I pushed the wrong button.  That did work.  It did. 
[02:31:30]  That's great.  That ends that bit, unfortunately.  All right, well, we were blowing until I fucked up.  No, that's actually funny, Martini Steve.  Opie and Anthony, the virus is spreading.  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  I'm just amazed how big that jacket is. 
[02:32:00]  I've got a picture of myself in Patrice's jacket, and it's going to be online in a few minutes.  And then we've got a picture of Patrice wearing the same jacket.  You look warm and comfy.  You can see that it fits perfectly on you, and it's like a dress on me.  It's unbelievable.  And like I was saying, going to the bathroom, I wouldn't consider you a fat guy.  Just a really big guy.  No, yeah, I'm like big.  I'm naked. 
[02:32:30]  I mean, you're what?  Naked.  If you saw me naked, it's like I'm fat naked, but in clothes and stuff, I'm a big dude.  How tall are you, 6'5"?  6'4".  6'4".  My God, man.  Anyway, it made everyone laugh around here.  The picture will be up in a few minutes.  All right, you guys want to do the most annoying songs ever?  Or, yes, we're going to do it anyway.  We're sacrificing the bear story for it.  All right, we can do that first.  Well, the bear thing is just one of the big stories here in the New York area.  They're doing a bear hunt in Jersey. 
[02:33:00]  Jersey?  But it's not really hunting.  And look, I'm not an animal rights guy at all.  But, I mean, there's real hunters around America that are doing the real hunt.  They're going out there.  They're a little scared, and they're sitting and waiting.  Some of these guys are, sure.  You're walking around the thick woods.  You don't know what's going to jump out at you.  Right.  And this bear hunt in Jersey, oh, my God.  All of a sudden, they let these people go, and the bears are just sleeping in trees.  They can only hunt in an area that's like the size of a football field. 
[02:33:30]  It's unbelievable.  Besides a dead bear body, what's a dead bear get you?  Because they're doing this because they need like 500 bears killed.  Oh, you get better boners.  Oh, bear claw stew or something like that?  Yeah, you got to like, I don't know, throw it in your stew.  People eat bear meat, and they use the skins, you know.  People eat bear meat?  Yeah.  Do they really?  Yeah, people actually eat bear meat.  Well, there's a lot of controversy here in, well, we're not in Jersey. 
[02:34:00]  But in Jersey, there's a lot of controversy because you've got the animal rights activists  pissed off, you've got the hunters that feel that, you know, this is their duty and their  rights and the bear population and it's getting out of control sometimes.  Yeah, so there's a limited number that they have to go out and shoot.  You know what?  People, people, population is getting out of control.  Yeah, how about calling that?  You ignore that, right.  Could you imagine if they declared hunting season on humans?  Can I shoot a sleeping motherfucker that I don't want?  Like fucking Detroit's getting a little overpopulated, so we're going to allow a hunt for a certain 
[02:34:30]  amount of time?  Too many Incans.  Incans.  You know what?  The Incan population is...  How great of a world would it be if you're allowed to go out and hunt humans for like  two days?  We just decide somebody's popular.  Some natural, some creature who only, only has sex for natural sex.  It's not like, oh, I need some pussy.  They have sex for the natural reason to have sex. 
[02:35:00]  To procreate.  To procreate.  And there's an overblown population of animals that are just being animals.  Right.  But we, who just have babies and do things that we do, there's no human hunt.  Completely taking over the world, but we're just ignoring that fact.  It's because the houses are being built.  Right.  Into their territory.  On the place that they used to fuck.  In the best territory.  And there was plenty of room for that.  Can you believe these people?  20 years ago, there was no problem because we weren't building there. 
[02:35:30]  So they were living their happy little bear life.  Oh, they had a shitload of woods to run around in.  There's a shark hunt today because, you know, people are getting killed on the, here.  But that's where the sharks, they're doing what they're supposed to do.  We're not doing what we're supposed to do.  It really makes me mad to just go, I'm going to, the bear population is overcrowded.  Let's just go kill some bears.  You cocksuckers.  Excuse my, it's just, it's just, how dare you?  That's why God is blowing everybody away and shaking everybody to death. 
[02:36:00]  And how is God angry at that?  Because it's like, it's arrogance, man.  It's arrogance.  Again, I got to put us, I agree, it is a little arrogance.  It's arrogance, man.  And it's, I don't like seeing any little furry creature being killed.  Being shot.  Unless they're completely delicious, then I have no problem.  But I'd rather someone else do it.  They're not the kind that knocks your face off with the, it's like.  No, the little black bears are fun.  It's the kind that you can feed and it goes, and you go, no, no, and you rub its head.  Do you think if there were panda bears that we'd be shooting them? 
[02:36:30]  Do you think if there were an overabundance of panda bears with those little white rings  around their eyes?  Even better, koala bears.  Koala bears than overabundance of seeing that poor little Qantas bear with the nose.  And he's all slow.  Slowly moving down.  Just eating their little leaves.  Anybody got any eucalyptus?  I bear.  There's some eucalyptus here, mate.  Very well aligned.  Yeah, you think they're just blowing them away?  No, no way. 
[02:37:00]  That's just wrong to me, man.  I don't know.  A lot of controversy in Jersey, that's for sure.  Well, the bear stories.  But we do have, and here it is, this won't end until something else comes to this planet  and we are number two.  Right now, we're number one.  We are on top of the fucking food chain.  Number one as far as our divine spark and our fucking we conquer the world, we rule.  But we're not number one on the chain.  No, we are.  We're only number one on the chain from one simple aspect. 
[02:37:30]  We knew how to create weapons.  Right.  We knew how to think.  We take shit.  Look around.  Anywhere you are right now, out there, look at everything that is buildings, cars, airplanes  that fucking fly, flying machines.  Look at everything.  Everything you're looking at came from the fucking ground.  We figured out a way to pull dirt out of the ground, find little pieces of it, trade 
[02:38:00]  them, melt it, cook it, fucking change it, and turn it into flying machines.  Into metal.  That's top of the fucking food chain.  It's top of the ingenuity chain.  It certainly is.  Let me tell you what will stop all that shit.  Nature.  And I'm going to tell you, these bears are nature.  When you get, if bears even fall for two seconds, hold up, freeze.  You know what?  Four of us can kill that fat bastard.  Oh, absolutely.  And locusts, there's 10 billion locusts.  If they decide, you know what?  Let's just start biting motherfuckers. 
[02:38:30]  We're finished.  And I can't wait.  I don't want to die being eaten by locusts.  No, who does?  But I want everybody else to be dead eaten by.  I just, I want nature to come back.  But the problem is they just can't organize.  That's their problem.  They're not organized.  One guy's got the idea, but they need us to talk to you.  Wrong locust leader.  Wrong locust.  One locust just to hold up.  18 fists.  The motherfucking Martin Luther locust.  I have a dream.  Martin locust king.  Martin locust king. 
[02:39:00]  Follow me, you bastard.  I'm telling you, man.  I'm fell with these.  I will show you to the promised land.  Martin locust right through this motherfucker's belly.  Just eat him.  Let's eat this motherfucker.  Let's eat him.  Hey, we got guys that killed bear on the line today.  All right.  The bear hunt.  The bear hunt.  The scary bear hunt that's happening in Jersey.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Oph?  How you doing, Anthony?  Hey, man.  What's happening?  Oh, you bear hunter.  I would have liked you, but you're shooting bears.  No, you know what it is?  It's these activists.  They go and they build these brand new, big, multi-million dollar homes up in Sussex County, 
[02:39:30]  New Jersey.  And they're the ones that are against it.  They're the ones taking their property away.  The bears got nowhere to go.  And as humans, we're the head of the food chain.  Everybody knows that.  And as the population of humans go up, the bears, they're going up too.  You know, one's got to kill the other.  Yeah, I mean, I agree.  I mean, you know, we have no choice.  We've got to control the bear population because we've already decided that we want to live in these areas.  And we're never going to live, you know, in harmony with the bears. 
[02:40:00]  Should we have not moved in to those areas?  Is that it?  You probably should have said, you know what?  But see, it's like this guy's saying what he's saying, which is understandable, right?  But look at how we are.  This is what I'm talking about, arrogance.  We have no sense of fairness.  If a bear killed somebody walking through the woods who didn't have a pistol, and the bear's like, wow, you know what?  Right now, I feel overpopulated.  I'm going to just chew that dude up and kill him.  It will be a hunt, not because there's overpopulation of bears. 
[02:40:30]  It'll be a hunt because that bear killed that person.  Then it's going to be, it's different from...  Just a retribution hunt.  Yeah, it's not going to be rational.  The bear aren't going after people that are in the woods.  It's going after the people in the neighborhood.  In their houses.  This is really funny.  In the backyard playing on the swings, and the bear's coming right into the backyard and mauling the kid up.  They moved into where the bear lives.  That's right.  With children.  And put up a swing set.  It's like, so if the bear's walking, even out of his peripheral, is something moving? 
[02:41:00]  There's like a kid swinging.  Then they're going to have one of those stop motion, those, what's the, the cameras, the security cameras with a bear, like, pulling some girl.  Big bear, just, yeah.  With the stop motion security bear.  I put in for a permit.  I got the permit, and I wasn't, I didn't have at all intentions.  I'm doing it.  But when you got a 347-pound bear walk 10 feet in front of you and just stare you down, you got to do something.  But they're black bears, man. 
[02:41:30]  They're black bears.  They're not.  They're not.  They're not.  They're not.  Huh?  He was bigger than you.  But those bears that those guys are hunting in New Jersey, they're not dangerous bears.  They're black bears.  Actually, no, because the one that I did shoot had two tags in his ears, and it was a nuisance bear.  And if you listen, they said, you know what he announced it on the radio.  They said, you know what he announced it on the radio.  They said, you know what he announced it on the radio.  It sounded like slavery.  Oh, they're going, they're going, they're going, they're going, they're going to lose this nigga right there.  Oh, it's the 60s all over again.  A nuisance bear.  They ain't going to get the fire hoses. 
[02:42:00]  That's a nuisance bear.  And that's the one, did we tell you not to come around here, boy?  That's that Rambo bear.  Turn around.  This one has a nuisance tag and an uppity tag.  Uppity.  He got an uppity tag in his ear.  This is going to have to hobble his.  This is the White Woods.  The bear woods is over there.  You're in the White Woods.  All right, thank you, Mike.  Also, another guy that killed a bear yesterday.  Jerry?  Hey, guys, how's it going? 
[02:42:30]  Were you fearing for your life yesterday when you killed that bear?  Come ride for us.  Well, I just wanted to, you know, add a little gas to the fire.  On top of everything else, we're allowed to bait the bear.  Yeah, I heard about this practice with donuts and stuff.  So not only is there a bear hunt and there's a certain number of tags that get issued and you have to call, like today, for instance, the hunters have to call up a number.  And if there was enough bear killed, they call the hunt off.  Right.  And what they want you to do is, and I'm one of those people that moved into Sussex, built the house. 
[02:43:00]  You know, we love it up there.  And I'm also a hunter.  And yesterday, yeah, they shot me a black bear.  But we actually bait the bear.  I mean, it really is kind of, you know, we kind of laughed at it.  We put out jelly donuts and hunting.  And you can't, and it's one of those things that you can't, you have to continuously shoot a bear.  Jerry, did you?  Until it dies.  And Jerry, be honest, man.  Did you feel bad at all on any level after the lights went out and you're by yourself?  No, I didn't.  I didn't on this bear. 
[02:43:30]  My first bear I ever shot.  If you've ever heard a bear cry.  I will tell you right now.  This is what it sounds like when bears cry.  It's a street that just goes right through you.  It's insane.  It shouldn't be called a hunt if you're laying out jelly donuts.  Yeah, jelly donuts.  The thing's there eating the jelly.  Hey, look.  It's a picnic basket.  Let me tell you something, man.  You know how you said when aliens come in and we're, I can't wait till aliens come here, right? 
[02:44:00]  And they get ready to shoot somebody and the person's going, please don't kill me.  Please, I got a family.  Please don't kill me.  Please don't kill me.  And all the alien hears is, oh, God.  Did you hear that human cry?  If you hear a human cry, that bear knows he's going to die.  You know what, though?  Excuse me, sir.  Hold on two seconds.  You know what?  I'd rather it be that the aliens come down and instead they're so far ahead of us that we don't even understand 
[02:44:30]  like the animals.  The animals just eating a jelly donut.  He don't know he's going to be shot.  He's sitting there.  So, like, we could just be a family eating dinner and all of a sudden your head just disappears  out of nowhere.  I don't want that to happen.  Just nothing.  I want motherfuckers to know.  I just need people.  This is so wrong to me, man.  This is wrong.  So we're trying to plead with it.  We're like, excuse me, I have a family.  A wife here.  I think we could get along as beings and share the planet. 
[02:45:00]  And he's just here.  And they're sitting there going, oh, look at him.  He's screaming.  I felt bad on my first one when I had to kill my first one.  Please don't kill me and my family.  I can't wait.  All right, Jerry.  So it was exciting yesterday?  Yeah, it was exciting.  Our group dropped three bucks.  We got a bear.  It was nice.  But what's crazy is you put out 50-gallon drums, and when you bait the drums, you bang 
[02:45:30]  the hell out of them, and you make as much noise as possible to also let everyone know  out there, oh, they just put food in the barrel.  So you put the food in, and then you bang the shit out of it, and it's like, you know,  they almost come when they hear the noise.  They know.  It's like the feeding bell.  Oh, my God.  And they creep up.  Yeah, that is intense.  How many bears do you have to kill, man?  How many before it's over?  It's just about over, I think.  Yeah, I think they got 300.  You know, if you had a limit, 400, can you?  I think it's about five-something this year, right? 
[02:46:00]  Yeah.  And is he cooking now?  Are you cooking the bear?  Yeah, what are you doing with it?  Guys, bear meat is brutal.  It's like chewing on a Cooper tire.  It's horrible.  So it's just a bear body somewhere in there, man.  Let me tell you something.  In Maine, we have bear, and you bait bear in Maine.  A lot of places, you bait bear, or you're treeing with dogs.  Bears don't even eat bear.  Yeah, so you're just...  You can throw anything out for a bear, and they'll just devour it.  Yeah.  And you can take a cut-off bear that we just skinned, you know, took what we wanted, and 
[02:46:30]  throw it, and they won't even touch it.  Don't you get that?  Don't you get that animal is...  He feels like it's cannibalism.  He's like, hey, I'm not going to eat my own kind.  Doesn't that give you the sense that it can communicate on that high level, but it's...  It's something that it won't eat its own kind.  Hey, Patrice, I want to know, when the aliens come, guys, what are they going to bait us  with?  What do you think?  Pussy?  Beer?  Same thing.  Jelly donut.  It'll fucking work, right? 
[02:47:00]  Where is that private tile?  Sir, jelly donut, sir!  And I'm not too worried with the alien thing, because I think they can go after my black  brothers first anyway.  No, because we're the ones, they know white people are fucking up to earth.  They're going to get you first, and they know it's over after you're dead.  And that's nothing.  You shoot fucking a black bear, a deer, it doesn't matter.  We're all the same to them.  Well, let's go to the tape here.  We got the news talking about the bear hunt in Jersey today.  Despite vocal protests, New Jersey's bear hunt got underway today in freezing temperatures. 
[02:47:30]  State officials say at least 54 bears were killed.  CBS 2's Jay Dow has more.  Nick Diamandis Jr. is no mere observer.  I took the shot.  He's an experienced bear hunter, all of 11 years old, who with his 12-gauge shotgun took  down this 200-plus pound bear today, not far from his home in Oak Ridge.  Sure enough, he died right down on the bottom of the hill.  Nick and his father joined almost 4,500 other hunters in the northwestern corner of New Jersey 
[02:48:00]  for day one of a week-long bear hunt, the second since 2003, when hunters killed 328 bears.  We structured the hunt at this time of year so that some bears, particularly the females  that are pregnant, will be in their dens, so that we don't get into a situation where  we're potentially taking too many bears too quickly.  Yeah, just the males.  You hear that, Patrice, an 11-year-old?  11 years old, he's shooting. 
[02:48:30]  That's nice.  They're so fucked as a society, man.  Yeah, it's just wrong, man.  I'm not going to lie to you, I don't get this at all on any level.  I like shooting, I don't like hunting.  Nature's been taking care of itself way before we got here, but now we have decided we have to take care of nature.  It's very cruel, man, because they do what they do, man.  It is what it is, you know what I mean?  I just don't get it, you know what I mean?  I'm sure a lot of people...  Too many bears, let's kill them.  It's like, why don't you find the most promiscuous male bear and maybe neuter them? 
[02:49:00]  Do that.  Maybe there's got to be a black bear that's fucking all the black bear bitches and just got to neuter that dude.  Cut his balls off.  Do something like that.  Go hunt some Iraqis.  You know what?  If you want a real fight, you know, instead of baiting them with jelly donuts, try to bait an Iraqi with a jelly donut.  Grizzly bears with nothing but a loincloth and a bowie knife.  Now that's a hunt.  There you go.  That's where...  Yeah, they should have some special rules. 
[02:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  And that's where all the AIDS and shit come from.  What?  Hunting bears?  No, it's the rainforest from development and people spreading out into places where we should not be.  You are insane.  AIDS is from the rainforest.  Yes.  AIDS is from the green monkey.  No, man.  Stop trying to blame Africa.  Someone fucked a green monkey in Africa.  It's all the fuck is.  I'm trying to blame Africa.  Trace that shit right back to Africa.  I'm trying to blame niggas for everything.  Their fucking biggest import and export is disease to Africa. 
[02:50:00]  No, it's those creepy, spooky jungles that we go in.  We're expanding into places where we shouldn't have been.  South America.  Yes, man.  The rainforest down there by the...  Yeah, man.  All of that stuff, man, going on over there.  Let's go to another clip here.  Protesters who took to the woods in an obvious attempt to distract the hunters and rescue injured bears  say none should be taken at all.  Within minutes, they can be aroused and disturbed and moved off.  This is totally a trophy hunt.  It's about killing cubs and sticking their heads on the wall. 
[02:50:30]  Some hunters dispute that assertion.  Others do not.  And this bear season is very, very necessary.  It's just from the aspect of children and livestock.  What do you plan to do with this bear?  This bear, well, we'll eat him and probably do a full body mount since it's a nice bear for him.  There you go.  Take him to the Texas Damus.  Do you see the people who call the show to say they shot him, but then listen to the  guys who are the representatives, like, to make it so civilized.  But the guys are like, hey, hey, we fucking bang the heap-a-doop-a-dop-a-doop. 
[02:51:00]  And then this guy's like, yeah, we eat him.  And it's necessary that we do what we do.  And, you know, murder is...  We must do what we do.  I got no problem with the bear hunt.  I don't care.  I do.  I think it's a little weird.  The baiting thing isn't really skillful hunting.  I'm sorry.  It's just not.  But the other kind of hunting, I have no problem with hunting.  For me, it doesn't work.  I always...  Even, like, out in California when I used to shoot rabbits.  Jesus, man. 
[02:51:30]  I'd shoot like a rabbit.  And you have such beautiful bunny eyes.  How can you...  How can you do that, Nick?  Because I'd eat the rabbit.  I was out?  Tastes like...  Tastes like chicken.  Tastes like chicken.  I was out camping.  I'm not as bothered with bears.  I have to, you know, shoot a rabbit and eat it.  I'm not as bothered with bears.  I don't want to see it.  But it doesn't make me trip out to think about guys shooting bears, I guess.  If it's an old popular...  But it's just...  If I saw it, it would kill me.  You know what I mean?  Yeah, I don't know.  I want to watch.  I don't want to see...  Like, I love steak. 
[02:52:00]  I love chicken.  I don't want to see them snapping necks or shooting bolts through their head to, you know, get  the meat.  But keep that assembly line of death going, because I love the burger.  Because I love meat.  I like my food freshly murdered for me.  That fucking cow holocaust that is going on.  Do you understand how many fucking cows have to be pulverized on a daily basis to feed this  country?  It's astronomical, the number of fucking cows that are being killed.  You know what I bought from the butcher yesterday?  I bought three shell steaks, two T-bombs. 
[02:52:30]  They're beautiful.  See, then you can't say shit.  And two quarter houses.  I bought my murdered food, and I probably bought some bear meat once, too.  I probably had a baby seal sandwich and didn't know it.  A baby seal sandwich.  Man, give me a medium baby seal.  Mother of the mother, this shit is overcooked.  Send it back.  See, none of us can talk when it comes down to it.  If you want to protect nature...  You ever have a London broil, just look in your shopping cart, barbecued London broil, just 
[02:53:00]  marinated and thinly sliced.  I don't care if they're fucking killing, which they are, just millions of cows.  Millions of cows.  Yeah, we should get a number.  Let's get a number.  Get a number.  I want to know how many cows...  A day have to die.  A day have to die for our meat.  I guess it's the suffering that I...  Is it the suffering?  Because if...  Even if baby seals were, say, gassed so that people can have their little baby seal coats, 
[02:53:30]  I might not be as bad on it, but the way they do it, the suffering, like pigs, if you  see a pig, an abattoir, the damn pig slaughterhouse, those pigs going alive and come out dead  in five seconds.  They just go...  And come out freshly porkchopped.  They don't know what happened.  There's no squirming around and dying.  It's just like, oh, you a dead motherfucker.  But certain... 
[02:54:00]  The suffering is what...  That's why I don't eat veal.  Not because it's not delicious.  Because I saw how they make veal.  Where does that veal want to go anyway?  What does that veal really want to do?  The suffering that it does so I can have a delicious veal chop is too much for me.  I've chosen a veal lifestyle.  All their heads are put out of a little hole, and here comes something that whops their head  off.  Once your head is gone, it's a wrap.  It's over, Johnny.  They're done.  One more clip here.  We've got to try to move on. 
[02:54:30]  We've got the Tourette's comic that's jonesing to get in here.  Or he's just having Tourette's.  Oh.  The state is hoping to call the 2,000 to 3,000 estimated bears in New Jersey that increasingly  interact with humans, mostly because of easy access to human garbage.  But witness this wounded bear from the first hunt two years ago.  Bear advocates spread out into the woods today looking for more and risking violation of  the state's hunter harassment law.  We're not in the best interest of the person who is concerned about bears to get into a 
[02:55:00]  situation like that.  That's an unsafe situation, and obviously we don't want to encourage that.  Now, these hunts are not automatic.  The state says they'll be reviewing them every year.  However, Governor-elect Corzine in the campaign expressed his opposition to a bear hunt.  He opposed the bear hunt.  There's a hunter's harassment law?  Yeah, because you can't go out there and, uh, because it's probably dangerous for a protester  to be marching around the woods, you know.  I'm sure they have all kinds of little gimmicks dressed in a bear suit as to trying to be a 
[02:55:30]  martyr.  You're a bear killer!  And then the person looks around twice.  No, but it's a hunter's harassment law.  Protecting the hunter even more.  Yeah, even though he's well-protected with the gun that he's got.  It's to protect the hunter from the stupid protester.  You're an asshole killing these bears!  Stop it!  You know, there is, you know.  Uh-oh.  We have a 1998, I guess, is the most, but I guess beef consumption hasn't really gone  up that much or down that much in, uh, in that long. 
[02:56:00]  Here, here's the number I have.  How many cows do you believe were killed in 1998?  1998.  In the year of 1998, how many cows killed for beef for, uh, this country?  Two hundred, three hundred, four hundred million people in this country.  Probably half eat meat, half eat cows, half eat steak.  I'll go with, um, two hundred million.  Two hundred million cows?  Mm-hmm.  I'll go with, um, thirty million cows.  Is this just for America or the world? 
[02:56:30]  That's, uh, uh, America, I guess.  Yeah.  Thirty million cows.  There's a cow, right?  To forty-one million, three hundred thousand cows.  You were, you had, like, a cow per friggin' person.  Per person.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What a steak.  You know, you cut it up in different ground meat.  That's what I'm saying.  You can't eat a cow a year?  One person?  And a lot of people only eat steak.  Like, would you?  Would you?  Think about it.  I mean, I, I think I had almost a whole cow this week.  Well, you gotta think, you know, there's Patrice, and then there's vegans. 
[02:57:00]  There's Patrice.  Then there's vegans, and then there's everybody else.  They don't, uh.  Listen, listen.  We gotta, should we take another break?  We'll play Gangsta Fag.  We'll get the Tourette's dude in.  And, uh, I don't know if we're gonna get to the annoying songs.  We'll try, though.  Oh, Jägermeister music tour is happening, Anthony.  Yes, it is.

[02:58:00]  at the State Theater tonight, call in to win a pair of VIP tickets where you will go to  the show and meet Disturbed and Corrosion of Conformity, all right?  Is this a true stat?  What happened?  I'm getting another statistic here.  The total number of mammals and birds raised and killed for food in the U.S. this year  is expected to reach 9.9 billion animals.  That's chicken.  That's chicken, pigs, cows, turkeys, whatever other animals we eat. 
[02:58:30]  What else do we eat?  What else do we eat?  Fish.  Fish.  That would have to be huge.  It just said mammals and birds.  Oh, it didn't even say fish.  Fish aren't even considered.  No one, no one gets pissed about the fish.  Dolphins.  There are people that call themselves vegetarians and eat fucking fish.  Well, you know why fish is one of those animal rights activists coming out for the fucking  fish.  I used to do a bit about this shit, so I mean, don't say I'm a hag if you heard it, but it's  like, I'm glad that my food comes murdered for me, but it's like, if I had to kill my 
[02:59:00]  own food, I would be a vegetarian except for fish, because they're built for murder, because  they don't have any eyebrows, and they don't have any ouch, like they don't scream, it's  just, like, so it's like, if a guy who couldn't blink, right, you was punching him and stabbing  him, and he just kept looking at you in his eyes, and not doing anything, but just, and  he was suffocating because he couldn't, you just keep stabbing him just because he's looking 
[02:59:30]  at you, so fish are set up to die, so in the least, we're supposed to eat fish.  It would be a different story if a fish could frown.  If a fish could go, oh man, that hurts, you'd be like, I'm sorry.  Like, he's got the hook in his mouth, and his eyes, his little eyebrows are going down  in the back, like, ow, and fish eyebrows, and he's going, ah, ah, ah, if he can at least  squint, but.  Oh, you'd never hook him.  Imagine that, and why don't we, and that's probably the reason we don't hunt any other land  animal with a hook, and bait, because how evil would that be to hook him and just watch 
[03:00:00]  him going, oh, ah, ah, I'm trying to reel in a cow.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  And they make noises, fish are just born to die.  A fish will make the same look eating and being happy, I guess, as a fish can be, as  it makes when you pull it into the boat and hit it with a wrench.  Exact pain and suffering.  It's the same face.  As soon as you pull out the water, it's choking to death.  But the eyes are just, the eyes are like, hey, what's happening, baby? 
[03:00:30]  So you don't cry, no lashes, no lids, no nothing.  Open his fucking eyes.  God didn't give him his eyebrows.  He didn't even squint a little for a wince.  What if the fish cried air bubbles?  Different story?  They do.  They're suffocating.  You don't see that shit on the boat?  You think they're crying somewhere inside that fish body of theirs?  The way they die, they just die.  Once you bring them on the boat, you're doing them a favor to kill them.  No suffering with fish. 
[03:01:00]  He's suffocating.  All right, get us out of here.  We got to move the show.  You ready to go, bro?  He's ready.  Okay, we'll get the Tourette's comic on the air next.  Phil for murder.  What is this?  All right, what's the problem?  Oh, boy.  What's the problem?  What's the problem?  The emperor is not happy with his coffee.  Oh, no.  Are we going to have to break into Jim Norton?  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Look at that cup.  What brand is on that cup?  I don't know.  It doesn't taste good because I don't like it.  Where do we get our coffee every day?  I like Starbucks. 
[03:01:30]  I like Starbucks.  And I don't like supporting the savages.  Savages.  That run most of these delis.  You're insane.  Yep.  You betcha.  You might be right.  Yeah.  Watch this.  You want to taste this?  Oh!  Oh!  Wow, that's really nice.  What?  Throw it against the wall.  I'm not going to die.  I'm a diva.  I'm on Starbucks.  Call him.  I'm an animal.  You betcha.  Jim Norton.  Norton.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  Coffee diva.  I know Starbucks is a big world order type of thing. 
[03:02:00]  At least they're not funding terrorism.  There's too many men.  Too many people.  Making too many problems.  And there's not a lot of love to go around.  Right.  Have you ever had something that would come from a real place when I said it?  We never stopped over here.  Land of confusion from Disturbed.  CONA virus spreading across America.  Tissue time might have to wait. 
[03:02:30]  We might have to do tissue time.  How about this?  Ladies, we're looking for more females to have phone sex with our listeners.  Strangers.  Yeah, of course.  You're good at phone sex.  You're a female.  Want to turn on a bunch of guys all over America.  I want to do tissue time to start the show tomorrow.  So we'll put started.  We'll put the word out right now.  Tomorrow's show, we'll start with tissue time, okay?  And we're not even going to remember.  Because we all are, we have short-term memory problems. 
[03:03:00]  We're retarded.  So all of a sudden, we're going to start the show tomorrow.  The phones are going to be lit with hot girls with sexy voices that want to do tissue time.  We're going to go, what the?  What?  And then, bam, the show's going to be off to a great start tomorrow.  I won't remember, so don't.  I'm not going to remember.  So remind us.  Tissue time starts off tomorrow's show, okay?  I'm like that guy from Memento.  That's me.  I forget it in seconds.  What are you talking about?  I'm like that guy from Memento.  What's this comic's name?  I woke up this morning. 
[03:03:30]  Tomorrow, you'll get nothing out of me because I won't remember.  But I woke up this morning.  The worst thing, it was 4.50.  Now, I get up usually a quarter after 5.  4.50, I had to piss so bad.  You can't get up, take a leak, and come back to bed when the alarm's going off at 5.15.  Yes, you can.  No, you can't.  Very low lighting.  Worst time.  Don't open your eyes all the way.  No, because now I'm laying there going, it's 4.50.  I'm just going to try to go back to sleep even though I've got to take a leak.  And then it gets worse and you're like, I'm not getting back to sleep. 
[03:04:00]  And then you look, now it's 5.  You get up and take a leak.  The second you lay down, you've got to get back up.  And then there's the hassle of actually getting back up in the upright position from laying down.  So, I was up this morning now from...  For 20 lousy minutes.  Who cares?  It's a big 20 minutes at that hour.  That's a very important one.  That's not like fucking, you know, 10 o'clock and 10.20 in the morning.  Or fucking, you know, 8 p.m. and 8.20. 
[03:04:30]  That's fucking between an hour that starts 4 in the morning, even though it's 4.50, my clock's still at a 4 and a 5.  That's the difference between last night and this morning.  It really is.  It's the same thing as when you walk up some stairs and then you see there's an escalator.  And you just go, oh, man.  But it's like, what?  You're up the stairs, but they're like, no, motherfucker.  It was an escalator.  Now I'm going to be tired later.  Yeah.  It's like, oh, man.  I didn't have to get up until 4.20. 
[03:05:00]  I could have saved a little energy.  But it's 4.07.  No.  You got to understand.  Big difference.  It is a mental thing.  You're right.  It is.  All right.  Let's get Lewis in here.  Lewis is a comic with Tourette's.  We want to get the rest of the gang in here.  We set up a microphone for him and everything.  He's going to do a little stand up.  We want to do this bit where we do open mic one morning.  Yeah.  I'm just going to reference this.  Huh?  Wait.  Get on mic, bro.  All right.  What do you got?  It's a book.  You got a book?  It's my children's book I just came out with.  Oh, that's right. 
[03:05:30]  You were telling us that you have a children's book.  Yeah.  Little Twitching Timmy the Turtle with Tourette's.  Oh, holy crap.  What page is good to read real fast?  The bio page.  The bio page?  The bio page.  Where's the bio page?  It's in the back.  Why is that a good page to read?  Because it's about me.  You got any other copies of this one?  No, we'll talk to you.  Here, here.  We'll talk to you.  Let's see.  We don't have to read about it.  It's a cute kid's book, you know?  It explains what Tourette's is and, you know. 
[03:06:00]  You illustrated it, too?  What kind of Tourette's do you have?  Well, you know what?  There's not really, like, class A, class B types of Tourette's.  There isn't a diabetes.  Mine, I was diagnosed when I was seven, so it's just, you know, I can have, you know,  be flipping out, cursing, doing one moment, and then the next, it could be so subtle that  you wouldn't know I have it.  You got the cursing, too?  Well, I do that occasionally.  I more have the, like, the gruntal tics and, like, the, you know, facial twitching and  all that stuff, and, you know, it's tough, but what the fuck?  I got to live with it.  So what do you say before you learn Swear that it's seven? 
[03:06:30]  What are you saying at seven during the Tourette's?  You know what I'm saying?  Well, when I was seven years old, my parents had noticed that I was making the vocal tics first.  That was the first thing.  I didn't do the cursing.  That's what they do, smacking their head, knock it off.  Fucking look like a retard.  Knock it off.  That was a cure for everything, like that.  Sometimes it worked, and sometimes it did.  And he has steaming confidence for a Tourette's guy.  Hell yeah, he does.  He's just, he's one, he really is a finger, air finger gun guy.  Thank God, because I hate when people come in and you're not supposed to acknowledge it. 
[03:07:00]  And it's like, all right, everyone's looking at each other like, what the fuck is he doing?  Well, growing up, I always tried to hide it, but, you know, eventually, you know, I was like, you know,  screw this, I have this, you know, I'm going to fucking deal with it.  Now, I'm 20 years old now, and I'm still living with this.  You got a girlfriend?  Well, my sex life is good, but I don't have a girlfriend right now.  How is your sex life good?  How is your sex life good?  I'm like a lady's personal vibrator, you know, especially when my mouth ticks are active.  Oh, he just has to tick a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, but that's, that's, that's, back end. 
[03:07:30]  What's the front end?  What's the game?  What's your game?  You know what?  I don't really like this.  What's your game when a girl looks at you and goes, um, okay, all right, all right.  After your face is down low and you're swearing at me, hello?  You know, I, I really don't talk about this, but to be honest with you, when, you know,  I meet a chick, I just got to have confidence, and my Tourette's are bound to happen, so  I play it up when it does, and usually I go for the sympathy angle, and it usually, usually  works pretty, pretty good.  What does Tourette's mean?  Like, where did they get that word?  To be honest with you, I don't know the definition, but it derived from the, uh, the name of whoever 
[03:08:00]  discovered it.  Was the guy Tourette?  Something, something like that.  I thought it was from the gun from the rapid fire swearing.  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.  By the way, by the way.  No one's ever shooting this guy.  What, what are you?  Oh, yeah.  That's a rough target, man.  That's a rough target.  No, well, I was thinking more, this guy has all the expressions, man.  He's no fish.  Oh, yeah, the eyebrows are gone.  It's funny, because, I know, his face is everywhere. 
[03:08:30]  That's all right.  Oh, now, when, when, when, when, when, when, when, when, when you go down on him, it's awesome.  But, you know, there's different types of tits.  I'm a ticking man.  Yeah, it's a joke.  Yeah, well, that's what we call, we call them tics.  Like, tics, that's a classification of what they are.  Like, I have this one tic where I can be waving my hand up and down, constantly in the air.  I can't even go to fucking auctions anymore because of it.  Oh, there we go.  All right, there's a joke.  Nah, he's so, I like this.  He's fucking.  Because who the hell does go to auctions?  The disabled made it funny.  There you go.  But that's, but that's just, I'm saying, when you go to get some ass, man, that, that, that five or ten minutes that you have to, like, get a girl hooked into you, man. 
[03:09:00]  Yeah.  And you start doing this because it's like, Tourette's is one of those diseases that you don't believe someone has.  Exactly.  Like, when you're talking to a girl, you're like, that, that, fuck face.  And she's like, um, what?  It's like, hey, baby, I got Tourette's.  Yeah, right, Mr. Sarcass.  People say that to me all the time.  They're like, you have Tourette.  Prove it.  Do some Tourette.  That's what I hear all the fucking time.  Do some Tourette.  It's like me going, exactly. 
[03:09:30]  It's like me going up to a model saying, if you're a model, then prove it, eat something, and throw it up.  Right, right, right.  It's like not something that I could actually, you know, just do on the drop of a dime.  I never, I never know when it's going to happen.  That was a good one.  Matt, it's talking fast.  Is there, is there techniques that help you through it?  Well, you know what?  I'm promoting a children's book, so I won't talk about some of them.  But for the most part, nicotine in cigarettes.  They've done some studies that that actually temporarily calms it down.  Now, they're not going to give cigarettes to like 12-year-olds.  I'm not talking about addictive fucking drugs.  I'm talking about mental things that you do to stop yourself from doing what you, like, it looks like, now you see how you're listening? 
[03:10:00]  Yeah.  That's when the twitching starts, baby.  Like, when you talk about it a lot, like, HBO just did this documentary on kids with Tourette's.  And while watching it, you know, it brought me back to my childhood.  I'm sitting here with the popcorn.  Popcorn's flying everywhere because I'm twitching like a fucking nutcase.  Because when I think about it, it's like, it's psychological and I can't help it.  I know what's going to happen.  I have this one tick where I'm fucking jumping up and down like this.  I'm in, I'm in Wawa, their Wawa's in Jersey. 
[03:10:30]  Like, and I'm getting a pack of cigarettes and I'm jumping up and down.  And it's like, I can't help it.  I have to live with this.  And, you know.  See, right now you seem very normal.  When we were waiting for you to come in, man, you were all over the place.  Well, because now that you're talking in front of a microphone, he's talking.  And he's very animated.  If he listens, he can put that energy into his talking.  But when he's just like kind of, you know, no black man can have Tourette's.  He'd be dead.  If I make a watch in the 7-Eleven going, you're jumping around, cigarettes, shoot this motherfucker. 
[03:11:00]  He's up to no good, obviously.  He's obviously on the crack pipe.  He's just jumping around, clicking.  Just stand there a minute.  Yeah, stand there.  Just stand there.  He can't.  Don't talk.  Don't move.  Let's just stand there.  Let's see if you can make 30 seconds without saying anything.  Yeah, he can't.  He fucking can't.  Concentrate.  There it is.  Look at him.  Now, can't you just like.  Oh.  Wow, that was rough.  You really haven't. 
[03:11:30]  You are crying.  You haven't it somewhere.  You really haven't.  He's a comic.  He's a comic.  Here's what he should do.  You should dress up in a suit so that you can pretend that you're fixing your tie.  If you're like.  All the time.  And you can just always be just going.  I tell you.  It's crazy.  It's crazy in here.  I tell you.  I always have ways of hiding.  That built up like a.  Yeah, that was too good.  We got to do that again.  Let's see how long he can last.  Well, imagine when I went from growing up in school.  You know what I mean?  I really tried to.  You want to take a bet?  Yeah, I'll take a bet.  I got $10. 
[03:12:00]  He can't not go.  He can't go 30 seconds.  30?  I'll give you less.  30?  He can't go 15 seconds without twitch.  I'm going 10.  It has to be a sound, not just a twitch.  All right.  A sound.  I'm saying 10 seconds.  You say 10.  I say 15.  But keep in mind, we're talking about it so much.  That's what's why.  All right.  Get ready.  That's what I'm banking on.  Here we go.  Give him a chance.  All right.  On the 10.  Here we go.  10 seconds.  Lewis, go.  And go.  He's concentrating, man. 
[03:12:30]  He's concentrating.  It's 7 seconds right now.  Damn it.  10 seconds is up.  I'm out.  Very good.  He's up.  Oh!  Damn it.  14 seconds.  Damn it.  Patrice just got in.  Fuck off!  Fuck off!  Yes, baby!  I just had a picture of him in the back of my mind saying, I just had a picture of him in the back of my mind saying, if you're not going to fucking twitch, I'll bust the cap in your ass.  Wait a minute.  I got $10 for this motherfucker.  Let's go double or nothing, man.  Double or nothing, man. 
[03:13:00]  Give that man that money right there, man.  Take that money right there.  God damn.  And you can imagine, you guys are having a fucking great time.  Isn't that what I went through in high school?  How did you sit in class?  That's some nerve-wracking.  I had this one, you know.  You're telling me.  I was in history classes one time, and the history teacher was writing notes on the board, and he had just made fun of my friend.  You know, they try to pick out a student if they're not listening, try to embarrass them.  So, this is the only time I really did it on purpose. 
[03:13:30]  And I was trying to get back at the teacher for fucking with my friend.  So, he's in the middle of writing notes, and he keeps looking back to see if everyone's paying attention.  And I start doing my flipper with emphysema tick, which is a real one.  It's like...  So, I'm doing this the whole time.  And, you know, you've got to have fun with it.  How can you mock your own tick?  That means you should be able to control it.  You know what?  First of all, I'm an actor.  I've only been doing stand-up for about a year.  You're an actor.  I've been acting for 12 years, and, you know, whenever I'm on set or doing a, you know, a stage or doing stage work or a film or whatever, 
[03:14:00]  it seems like I can shelf it while I'm concentrating on what it is.  Like, in that same documentary HBO did, they had this one kid, he's a little 12-year-old,  he's, like, screaming the weirdest things you can think of.  And one of them is, caffeine, caffeine!  And he's just screaming this, and he plays the drums.  And whenever he plays the drums, it, like, goes away, you know?  Hey, do you have the racist Tourette's?  Because that would be so huge today, man.  So, you know, isn't there such a thing as racist Tourette's?  Well, I had a lot of black friends growing up, so, like, they would, and this is funny that you say that, 
[03:14:30]  because they would always try to make me do it.  They would be like, yo, you know, you gotta shout the N-word.  And I just feel really uncomfortable doing that.  But they talked about it so much, because they knew when I think about something, a word,  if you keep saying a word around me, eventually it can become a tick.  So, every day, they would be like this, what's up, nigga, how you doing, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga?  And it just clicked into my head.  And I was like, guys, stop doing this, because I know you want me to say this.  And basically...  Stop it.  Stop. 
[03:15:00]  You're going to force me to be racist.  I know.  You know, I...  And then he says something else, and he gives that nigga, he goes,  Boop, porch monkey.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  We didn't say porch monkey, no, but I'm saying that.  That...  I thought we was your inspiration, now, nigga.  You could be...  Cone, huh?  What?  These are the type of guys I grew up with every single day.  I love it, that's why I make fun of it.  Look, it's Bill Burr in Charleston, South Carolina, on CNN.  He dyed his hair black. 
[03:15:30]  I wonder where he's been.  All right, how about another bet?  This is too good.  Double and nothing.  Well, the listeners want to bet.  They're betting at home.  All right, look.  They're playing at home.  15 seconds is it, man?  You think he can not...  I think the pressure's on.  Even though I lost with 10 seconds before, I'm going with 10 again.  You're going with 10?  I'm going with 10.  I'm going with 10.  It's a shame you can't smoke in here.  That would bind me about 20 seconds.  I'm going with 18.  Because he's going to fight through 15, but he can't go past 15 seconds.  All right.  How much?  10 bucks?  10 bucks.  All right.  They're betting at home, too, man.  These feedbacks are going crazy. 
[03:16:00]  Some people are saying, best bet ever.  12 seconds.  All right, here we go.  We didn't start yet.  All right, what's the bet?  We got money on the table.  I got 10 bucks.  All right, 10 bucks is what?  10 bucks on...  He says 10.  I say 18.  I'm giving him three months.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  You can tell I have a lot of dignity.  I say 10.  Are we doing prices right rules or just closes? 
[03:16:30]  No, it's...  Ann says 10.  Patrice says 18, right?  I haven't been this nervous since I was on The Tonight Show.  I was going nuts even when I was there with my tics in the dressing room.  You were on The Tonight Show?  Yeah, I did.  I did one of those segments that...  You know how David Letterman has stupid human tricks while he has, like, don't try this  at home?  And it's about my...  It actually links back to my Tourette's.  Because I was on this Tourette medicine, it made me gain a lot of weight when I was  growing up.  I had peaked at 300 pounds at 16.  Get the fuck out of here.  And I lost over 85 pounds, and I ended up having all this loose skin.  So long story short, I do this trick where I can stick a wiffle ball back underneath 
[03:17:00]  my loose belly skin and hit a wiffle ball off a T-ball stand without  using my hands.  And I hit it to Leno on set, and that was the gig I did.  Do you still have the loose skin?  Unfortunately, I'm trying to get rid of it.  Do you want to see it?  How much do you weigh right now?  Right now, I weigh about...  See, I originally was 85, but I gained it.  Actually, I'm about 230, 235.  He doesn't look 230?  230?  Well, I have about 30 pounds of skin.  Oh, that's why.  Because you look...  He still doesn't look 230.  Oh, wow! 
[03:17:30]  Whoa!  Get that on video.  You know?  And it's sad, because I don't have any insurance, so it's not like I can get the surgery.  Why did a guy do this to him?  He's built like a bitch.  I know!  It's like, what the fuck?  He already made me have fucking Tourette's, and now he has me have titties.  He's built like a...  A marshmallow.  A mother.  He's built like a...  He's built like a mother.  I'm built like a 90-year-old hooker.  A bitch with a newborn.  He's built like a 52-year-old mom with five kids.  Mom.  I can't believe he has lasagna and Tourette's. 
[03:18:00]  You should have...  Only The Rock should have Tourette's.  He should pull up his shirt and go, I am as sexy as...  I work out every fucking day.  Where's a pizza maker when you need one?  He's a lazy Tourette's.  All that shake is to have you lose at least 10 pounds a week, motherfucker.  What is he eating?  It was funny, because I was sitting down on my couch right now, though.  That 18 is not good, but I'm going to stick with 18.  All right, we're going to bet again.  Here we go.  I'm IQ. 
[03:18:30]  Let me get a drink of water.  What are you going with?  I'm just like the MC here.  Anybody else in?  I'm the game show host.  Come on.  Anybody else in, dude?  Come on.  Anybody else want to do a little side bet?  Who's in, though?  What are you in for?  What are you in for?  This is some good money going back and forth.  Give me two to one on like 30 seconds.  Two to one on 30?  He ain't lasting 30 seconds.  He ain't going 30 seconds.  He ain't going no 30 seconds.  All right, give him another thing.  If I read sometimes, reading helps me sometimes diverse it.  So you don't want me to do anything. 
[03:19:00]  No, no, no, no.  We want you to concentrate.  Concentrate your best.  All right, there we go.  Damn, man.  Dude, there is so much betting going on around the world right now.  The feedback is going nuts.  And to think I wrote the short line for three years for nothing.  This paid off.  All right, here we go.  I'm IQ, all right?  You can do whatever you want until I say go.  All right.  Two, one, go.  Can I talk?  Uh-oh.  No.  Start again.  Start again.  I bet you can't talk.  Start again.  You can't talk.  I thought I could talk.  I'm going to be completely quiet. 
[03:19:30]  On my cue, we're going to start.  You can't say shit.  We're just going to...  It's going to be silence.  Go.  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  I don't like what you're doing.  Opie, you're counting and giving him something to concentrate on.  Yeah, listen.  All right.  I don't want to know.  No.  All right. 
[03:20:00]  Anthony, look.  Look, look.  Anthony, Anthony.  You know that?  Play it around.  Anthony's a professional better.  You know that this is not fixed.  I'm going to start right now.  No, no, no, no, no.  Don't tell me when you're starting the timing.  No, no, no, no.  All right.  That's right.  I just think this should be complete silence.  You're right.  You're right.  You're giving him something to work on.  Nothing.  Wow.  That was a good one.  Is that called the chainsaw?  You seem to name them.  That's called the rubber lips.  That's the workout after stretch. 
[03:20:30]  All right.  All right.  Bed is back on.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  I just thought it would be, I don't know what would happen to the system if it's just dead  air for a while.  So I know it's down.  We should be all right.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  I'm IQ again.  And wait.  He wasn't ready there.  I'm IQ.  Here we go.  And go.  And go. 
[03:21:00]  What was it?  What was it?  22.  Who wins that?  Who fucking wins that?  Who was at 30?  I was at fucking 18.  Yeah, he was closer.  Were we going closest?  Yeah, because I asked him if we were doing Prices Right rules.  I thought we were doing closest without going over. 
[03:21:30]  No, that's why I asked for Prices Right.  Yeah, like once he passes your time, I think you're out.  So is him.  I think it would be him.  I asked if we were doing Prices Right rules.  That's Prices Right rules.  I think it's got to be in this kind of thing.  I think it's got to be closest, man.  No?  Yeah, see, I was doing good, but then I...  I'm out regardless, so you two motherfuckers argue about it yourself.  I was far away.  I was actually doing pretty good the first time,  but then I got a glimpse of that monkey head up there,  and that's what really, you know, agitated it.  The monkey head freaked you out?  It's just kind of, you know, Jesus.  It's anything.  Christ, I'm telling you, that's the best shot he could possibly give. 
[03:22:00]  How about one more bet?  Oh, God.  One more, and then we'll have him do some stand-up.  This is the real deal, me and Patrice.  Yeah.  Right?  The real deal.  All right, what's the rules here?  Here's the money.  Oh, my God, man.  Well, no, there's 10 in there.  Okay, keep it in there.  Whose is that?  That's yours, I think.  No, he's Patrice.  He made his 10.  Yeah, go ahead.  Yeah, that's Patrice.  There's mine.  All right, what do we got?  All right.  Now, obviously, I've got to go over 10.  Well, you have to.  It seems to be, now, based on research, 18 seems pretty good, but, and he's working on, 
[03:22:30]  I'm going to go with an even 20.  We are going closest to the number.  It doesn't matter if you go over or not.  All right.  If that seems to be the way.  I'm going to go down.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  15.  This guy.  15.  He cannot.  This is.  He struggled at 22.  I know.  That was pain and suffering.  15 seconds.  Do we have that on video?  You know how you have, like, a big, you got to think of a big shit.  You know you do, and it just can't come out.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a little turtle head poking out, but you just can't get.  That's what it feels like.  Too much going on. 
[03:23:00]  You know, in my head.  He had to close his eyes that time.  I know.  I know.  I know.  He was real Tai Chi on that shit right there, and that's it.  That's as best as he got.  Yeah, it was.  15 seconds again.  All right, all right.  People saying best dead air ever.  Ever.  All right, here it is.  We're going to go now.  Me and Patrice are in.  Patrice is saying 15.  I'm saying 20.  All right, okay.  He's warming up.  All right, we're going to start this in 10 seconds, though, so get it all out.  Get it all out there, Lewis.  Whatever you need to do.  There is nothing to get out. 
[03:23:30]  All right, here we go.  It's all in there.  You can count down.  All right, and go.  Oh, my God.  Holy shit.  Oh, yeah.  It was like right between 15 and 20. 
[03:24:00]  Exactly.  It was exactly between 15 and 20.  We have to go again.  15 and 20.  We have to go again.  I swear to God.  That was 17.5 seconds.  17.5.  I don't want to rest people.  Holy shit.  Damn.  This is science that we study.  Wow.  You cannot go past it.  He's in deep shit now.  Oh, my God.  I feel like Jerry Lewis on crack.  I don't know what to think now, though.  All right.  I got to bring it down a little bit.  The money's in. 
[03:24:30]  I got to bring it down a little bit.  You guys should add to the pot, man.  I'm going to go.  Add to the pot.  Come on.  All right.  Throw a little more in there.  Lewis, get it all out, bro.  Another round.  Get it all out.  What do you got in there?  Put a 20 and take 10 back.  All right.  Take 10 back.  Here we go.  All right.  This is a...  God damn.  Oh, God.  I'm here now.  All right.  He's boinging.  I'm going.  All right.  You know what?  The funny thing is, when I go in a club and I hear rap music, I end up doing it to the 
[03:25:00]  beat sometimes.  All right.  Here's what we got to do.  He's boinging me.  We got to flip a coin to see who's going to pick first, because that seems to be pretty  important.  All right.  So, Opie, if you'd flip this corner.  All right.  Here we go.  Evelyn.  Not this.  Who's calling it?  Tails.  Ed's.  All right.  Go ahead.  Anthony's got the time.  All right.  I'm saying 16 seconds. 
[03:25:30]  16 seconds.  Now, this is the closest, over 100.  Closest.  Closest.  Yeah, it doesn't matter.  That last one was dead center, man.  I was ready to give Anthony the title.  It was totally tied.  21.  Wow.  All right.  He's got some balls here.  He's getting tired.  I've got some balls.  He's boinging me.  He's tired.  All right.  All right.  Here we go. 
[03:26:00]  I say 16.  16.  He's at 21.  21.  How much is in the pot?  There's 40 bucks in here now.  All right.  Here we go.  One second.  One second.  All right.  He's going to take a little drink of water.  He's getting water.  Join me in a little bit.  Do your thing, man.  This is me.  All the Tourette's kids, the book, this is going to show that you have self-control.  That's right.  All right.  This is for Little Twitching Timmy.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  What's the name of the book again?  Little Twitching Timmy, the turtle with Tourette.  You can take a look at it at my website, laughterbyloo.com.  Laughterbyloo. 
[03:26:30]  Laughterbyloo.  That's spelled L-O-U, laughterbyloo.com.  Boing!  All right.  I'm telling you, baby.  Boing means victory, baby.  That's close to bingo.  It's like you guys are talking about it so much.  You have all these pictures on the wall.  It's like.  That's what I'm banking on.  Anthony, you're sold.  Well, no.  I think Anthony's not fucked.  I think Patrice is fucked.  I think Patrice is fucked.  All right.  Here's the deal.  Boing!  All right.  Here we go.  Anthony says it'll last 16 seconds.  Patrice says it'll last 21 seconds.  21. 
[03:27:00]  Go ahead.  Get him.  All right.  Here we go.  On my cue.  We're just waiting for the hand to hit six.  Hit it.  It's worth it.  I don't know. 
[03:27:30]  Oh, damn. You take it away, brother.  You fair and square. Legit. Wow. Wow. He was holding that in. When it passed 16, I'm like, damn, come on.  Wait a minute. We've got to share this, baby. He's so proud, right?  Oh, wow. I think that was 26 seconds of your keeping track at home. Wow. 
[03:28:00]  Oh, man. I'll buy a couple of packs of cigarettes. Dave from Atlanta. Dave, what's going on?  Hey, man. I've been listening to the bits for five minutes, just turned on the radio. Well, what are you guys doing?  You're going to have to listen to the replay. Yeah, we're just betting.  We're betting on how long this Tourette's guy can stay silent before he twitches.  Guys, guys, call me Twitchels. It's actually funny because Nicole Ritchie...  Oh, really?  Yeah, I was on the Simple Life with Paris and Nicole Ritchie. 
[03:28:30]  And that was the whole premise of the scene.  You know, I was on the bus with them. They were on the Greyhound bus.  And my Tourette's are acting up.  And Nicole Ritchie jumps up on my lap, gives me a big hug, tries to calm me down, and calls me Twitchels.  And she's the one that nicknamed me it.  So I go by Twitchels, you know, whenever I do stuff like this.  God bless them.  Yeah, God bless them.  God bless them. We can walk...  We can go all over the world making money.  Don't you feel a lot better about yourself when you, like, see this?  I don't feel a lot better about myself.  God damn it, because... 
[03:29:00]  I got an idea.  Louis should do a stand-up.  We've got about 15 people in the studio.  And I'm thinking, Anthony, that we should have a little tissue time.  We get a girl to talk dirty to Louis, and we tie the two brand-new bits together.  Certainly.  We need a girl that's really good at talking dirty and is able to do a little phone sex.  Can I tell you what type of women I like? Would that help?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.  Certainly.  Okay.  What do you...  Oh, right now? 
[03:29:30]  Yeah, what do you dig on?  You know, for some reason, I don't know what it is, but it always...  It gets to me.  I like black women.  And when they talk angry, it kind of...  I don't know if it's a turn-on, but I might...  I know black women.  I don't know.  I just always wait.  I have five minutes.  Uh, sweetie, um, if you...  I don't know what the fuck Tourette's is.  See, I love that.  But the next time you call me a nigga by mistake, I know I got a cousin named Tourette, but... 
[03:30:00]  By the way...  I don't know what it means and shit.  Damn.  I'll let...  Please, guys, realize that I was coaxed by my home dogs to do that.  I was coaxed by that one.  Oh, my God.  I'm gonna walk out of the studio and get fucking shot.  Nah.  Or, no, I won't.  Right.  No, you won't.  We learned that.  I like that one.  All right, we need a girl that is good at talking dirty to call the show immediately.  Could be the best fit ever.  That's the one I've had since I was about 14 to jump and take. 
[03:30:30]  How about we get Louis to do some stand-up, okay?  You want the lights turned down a little bit?  Whatever you got.  Yeah, make it more club atmosphere.  Here, turn that down a little bit.  There we go.  A little bit.  And the children's book.  Come on.  We gotta get the plugs out.  Oh, yeah.  Well, basically, I just came out with a children's book a couple months ago called Little Twitching  Timmy, The Turtle with Tourette's.  And it's a fully color-illustrated children's book.  I wrote and illustrated it.  Trafford is the published company that you guys can check it out at Trafford.com or LaughterbyLou.com.  And another, or you could call it, or it's a great book. 
[03:31:00]  You should have it, man, plugging everybody's shit.  Hey, this is Jim Norton.  I'll be over at the Westbury Music Fair.  It's Patrice O'Neill.  I'll be at Caroline's next week.  Now, you guys, you guys got me so fucking worked up.  When I do a show, I usually smoke a bunch of cigarettes, get in my zone.  But now I've been, you know, you're a toy for 15 minutes. 
[03:31:30]  Exactly.  I love it, though.  I gotta calm down, though.  How many minutes do you want to do?  A couple minutes?  I'll just do a couple, a little few materials.  All right.  Whatever you want to do.  But, you know, usually what I say is, you know, people always ask me, they say, you know,  what's Trafford's?  Wait, are you starting your act?  Are you interrupting it?  Oh, yeah.  Oh!  Oh!  Yay!  Oh!  I like this kid.  Fuck you, I'll be.  Fuck you. 
[03:32:00]  What's this world coming to?  You motherfucker.  Oh, it's my disorder.  Are you starting?  Are you at the left thing?  I thought you said start the act, Spider.  I thought you said start the act, Spider.  This is the act.  Oh, my God.  They didn't do the ain't bullshit.  Oh, God bless him.  They didn't give you the big intro on everything.  Man, don't turn on him, you bastard.  God damn.  Oh, my God.  Guys, it works right into it, and it was so, like, spontaneous, and Opie just trampled him. 
[03:32:30]  I'm sorry.  All right.  Oh, for the, you know, you know, I...  I fucking do it again.  All right, here we go.  All right.  It's, uh, Lewis the comic with Tourette's, everybody.  All right, thank you.  Thanks, guys.  You know, what I was, you know, what I was starting to say was, you know, people always ask me, you know, what's Tourette's like?  And, you know, what is it? 
[03:33:00]  And I always, you know, start off, I want to explain what Tourette's is.  And in a nutshell, basically, it's this disorder that calls people to twitch, grunt, curse, and they can't control it.  In my case, I have one of my big ones is where I constantly jerk my head back and forth.  That's one that I do every so often.  And when I do that, what are you pointing to?  Watching TV.  So, basically, I'm a Japanese tourist, we're a nightmare.  But, besides the point, fuck you, I have Tourette's.  I'm sorry, we don't want you going away in the ambulance and making the ambulance sound yourself. 
[03:33:30]  Yeah, you almost cracked your head on the TV, so we all got nervous.  Thank you, guys.  We were worried about your safety.  We weren't ready to laugh there, because we thought you were going to crack your skull.  Well, thank you for caring.  Fuck you.  Ambulance is here.  For those of you who are just...  All right, here we go.  Back to Lewis the comic with Tourette's, everyone.  Oh, shit. 
[03:34:00]  All right.  Okay, I'm good now.  I'm good.  You know, for those of you just tuning in, if you missed it, one of my tics that I like the most is when I took her,  I'm raising my hand up and down, constantly in the air, and I just can't control it.  Which fucks me out of going to auctions.  Because I could never go there.  So, laugh.  But we heard that one.  I know.  For those of you just tuning in...  All right.  Oh, my God.  That's probably...  You guys fucked me up today.  Oh, my God.  You guys...  Oh, my God. 
[03:34:30]  That's actually him.  Wait.  That's him.  Look, look.  I don't...  Look.  You guys have got me so worked up.  I don't want to...  I don't want to do this.  You guys got me so...  What I do want to do is I want to ask you...  Just ask me what...  You know, ask me anything you want.  You know, I want to talk to you about it.  Because the reason why I'm doing this, I want to spread awareness.  Awareness.  I want to spread awareness, guys.  You know?  Oh, ow.  Oh, oh, oh, ow, ow. 
[03:35:00]  Anyway.  Yeah, someone wants to know if your children's book is available on tape.  Oh, my God.  You just reminded me.  They want me to do an audio version of me.  Yes, fuck on tape.  See, Jane.  What?  What?  Whore.  What?  Jane's a whore.  Little twitching to me was just as normal as you.  Fuck off.  Ow.  Ow.  Oh, oh, it hurts.  It hurts.  It hurts.  There's so many people calling right now.  We can't get the lines free. 
[03:35:30]  We try to get the lines free so a girl calls in to do the phone sex thing.  Oh, my God.  I can't wait.  And just to let you guys know, you know, there's not a lot of people without Tourette's.  Wow, that's some sound.  Meat charge, catch him.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fucker.  Hi.  You know, I met a man on the street the other day.  He said he hadn't had a bite in weeks.  What'd you do? 
[03:36:00]  That's the smartest thing I've ever heard.  I'm going to go home and eat a roll cookie dough while watching Go to Girl Rerun right now.  You make me hate myself.  No.  But I love you guys.  It's cool.  But I was saying, there's only one famous person that, to my knowledge, other than Ned Campbell's  brother, who really isn't famous, that has Tourette's.  You guys know the Philadelphia Phillies, I don't know if you know, 1993, around there, a player  by the name of Jim Eisenreich.  He went to the World Series with them. 
[03:36:30]  He had Tourette's.  And that's why I wear my Philly scat wherever I go.  It's kind of like a reminder of how fucked up I am.  Wow.  Look, you are exhausted.  You are exhausted.  You all right, Louis?  Oh, no.  I have fun with this.  It takes a lot of blessing, man.  God bless you.  It takes a lot out of me.  It just looks exhausted.  The next time we do some kind of live event, you've got to be there, man.  God bless you, man.  I'll be more than happy to show up. 
[03:37:00]  Thank you.  You are constantly working.  Please make this guy some type of celebrity.  Please.  Absolutely.  Can you please?  Doesn't it seem like it's constantly like you're jogging all the time?  He can't shut up.  No.  If he does not stop, he's going to do it.  So he has to just go.  Do you twitch in your sleep?  Go.  You know what?  That is a funny thing.  I never knew, so I decided to tape myself one night.  And, you know, this is a true story.  I wasn't ticking throughout the whole night.  And the tape only lasted like two hours or so. 
[03:37:30]  Yeah.  I could have.  But I started to feel myself while I'm sleeping, and I started to do this, going up and down.  And I didn't know if that was a tick or if I was just in a dream.  But to my knowledge, I never really know if I'm actually.  You don't make sounds or anything?  I'm sleeping.  I don't know.  I wouldn't know.  But on the tape, you didn't make any sounds?  Oh, no.  Just like the turn over.  And how do you get to sleep?  You know what?  One of the things that I always say is if, you know, if my ticks are so bad, the one thing 
[03:38:00]  I like to do, I like to.  Oh.  Gee.  Oh, gee.  So, maybe it's dice with Tourette's.  I'm at this, I'm at the bank.  And it's ticks online at the bank.  I sound like an old Jewish guy with hemorrhage.  Here I am.  So, I'm banning this broad in the ass, and she's like, a gig.  Oh, oh, a tromba. 
[03:38:30]  Oh, and the injetion sound.  Hickory dickory dog.  This chick.  Jack, be nimble.  Jack, be quick.  Oh, I'm banning.  Hello, sir.  Welcome to McDonald's.  What can I take to order food?  Oh, wow.  Dennis from Whackbag.  This guy sounds like a lost member of the Three Stooges. 
[03:39:00]  Oh, you know, talking about...  I think you scared the women away because they're not calling for the phone sex thing.  Oh, you know what was funny?  Talking about the simple end.  A few months after that, Nicole Rich was on Letterman.  And she talked about me on Letterman about having Tourette's.  She didn't remember my name, but she just referred to me as Twitchell's.  Bitch.  And I thought, yeah.  Mm-hmm.  So, anyway, he has complete access to all his noises that he can do on purpose and by mistake. 
[03:39:30]  A repertoire.  So, he can just go brr and brr at the same time.  He can't control it.  He can't control it.  He can't control it at the same time.  Patrice, it was funny because she did a book signing in New York.  Two weeks.  I can't look at you now.  She did a book signing in two weeks ago.  I just want to die.  So, two weeks ago, Nicole Richie did a book signing at Virgin Megastore. 
[03:40:00]  And I went to go see her, not only to get a copy of her, but to give her a copy of mine.  But to continue your stalking of her, obviously.  No, the first time I saw her since we did it a year ago.  Yeah.  Shot the episode.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Anyway.  So, what we did was...  So, I'm so fucking nervous now.  Okay.  So, she jumped up and she yelled, Twitchell.  She remembered me instantly, gave me a big hug.  And that's a good feeling that people remember me.  But you know what the whole point is?  You know, I'm living my life.  I'm doing what I have to do. 
[03:40:30]  And anyone who has Tourette's Syndrome, they shouldn't, you know, go into studios and try  to be quiet for 15, 20 seconds.  No, no.  They really should just have fun and try to do whatever they want to do.  You know, my teacher, when I was in about 7th, 8th grade, looked at me, did not believe.  Me, did not believe.  That's what I had to do with.  You just got to keep talking.  The next time he's here, this is the bet, not silence.  It's how many within a span of, you keep track.  Somebody keeps track.  Oh, that's a good one.  Within a span of five minutes of him talking.  Wow.  How many.  Do me a favor.  Don't remind me about that. 
[03:41:00]  Because I don't want to be thinking about it.  So, it's fair.  Don't remind me that you're going to do that.  Oh, it wouldn't matter anyway, motherfucker.  No.  As you try to concentrate.  But anyway, when I was a teacher, boy.  He wants to be doing it now.  He's telling a heartfelt story.  When I was a child, someone called me.  My teacher in seventh grade, basically, she told me, she said, listen, Lewis, you cut  it out.  And I was having an outburst.  And she looked at me and said, you don't have Tourette's.  You don't have it. 
[03:41:30]  It's made up.  It's a lie.  And that's why I'm trying to, you know, I'm not getting all mushy, but that's why I'm  trying to spread awareness.  Because people still don't believe.  It's, you know, not all people, but most people find it hard to believe that it's a real  disorder.  And it is a neurological disorder.  And, you know, that's why I'm writing this book.  That's why I'm trying to get the word out there.  And I've actually finished a screenplay, which I haven't, you know, not a name act, but  I have some people attached to it.  And I want to spread the word.  It's an unfair disease because you can't have, it's like stuttering.  You just can't have sympathy for it.  But I'm sure it's something we don't want to show. 
[03:42:00]  And I never win stuttering.  All right, listen, listen.  We've got 20 seconds left in the show.  So, Lewis, we've got to get all the plugs in.  How do they get the children's book?  Basically, you can order Little Twishing Timmy, the Turtle with Tourette's through my website,  laughterbylue.com.  That's laughterbylue.com.  Or Trafford.com.  Or by calling me at toll-free number 888-232-4444.  I was wondering where the sound was during the plug.  Patrice O'Neill, we'll see you tomorrow. 
[03:42:30]  This is the Queen's Search for the Fall.  It will be an Anthony show. </pre>
