<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a heated debate about the controversial ending of *The Sopranos*.  Callers and the hosts overwhelmingly condemned the finale as poorly written, boring, and lacking a satisfying conclusion.  Specific criticisms targeted the abrupt ending, the seemingly irrelevant A.J. subplot, the unrealistic depiction of Frank Vincent's character's death, and the protracted scene of Meadow parking her car.  The use of Journey's "Don't Stop Believin'" was also heavily scrutinized.  Frank Vincent himself called in, agreeing with much of the criticism but defending David Chase's artistic vision.  The hosts speculated on Chase's motivations, suggesting a desire to subvert expectations or a possible *Sopranos* movie in the future.  The discussion was punctuated by vulgar jokes and offensive remarks.  The show briefly touched upon other TV show finales and promoted the Opie and Anthony comedy tour. One host's personal grooming habits were also briefly discussed.

The show then transitioned to a caller's inquiry about hair removal techniques, specifically addressing challenges presented by back tattoos. This segued into another caller, Steve, who humorously recounted accidentally shaving off an eyebrow while using an electric beard trimmer.  This prompted further anecdotes about grooming mishaps and the problems associated with long hair.

A contest for Jones Beach comedy show tickets followed. The bulk of this segment, however, focused on a scathing critique of Al Roker, targeting his past criticism of Don Imus (and Imus' subsequent firing) juxtaposed with Roker's recent insensitive joke about epileptic seizures.  Audio clips of Roker's joke and his apology were played, with the hosts deeming the apology insincere and hypocritical.  They highlighted a perceived double standard in media responses to such incidents.  Numerous callers shared their opinions, some personally offended by Roker's comments due to their own or loved ones' epilepsy. Several callers described their attempts to contact NBC to complain.  The hosts repeatedly emphasized Roker's hypocrisy and the inconsistent application of accountability within the media.  The segment ended with continued discussion of Roker and a promotion for a Father's Day giveaway: a date at the Bunny Ranch.

The final segment centered on a contest to send a lonely, married father, “Bear,” to the Bunny Ranch. Bear detailed his 12-13 year sexless marriage, describing his wife Louise's apparent asexuality and his desire for companionship.  Surprisingly, Louise approved of Bear's potential trip.  The hosts, along with caller Jimmy, discussed Bear's predicament and arranged for his potential visit to the Bunny Ranch on Friday.  Jimmy also shared his own relationship issues and differing perspectives with the hosts on his girlfriend. The segment revisited Al Roker's apology and the perceived media double standard, promoted the upcoming Jones Beach show (including performers and ticket giveaways), and concluded with humorous speculation about how *The Sopranos* could have ended similarly to *The Sopranos*. The segment was filled with crude humor and sexually explicit content.  Beyond Bear and Jimmy, no other guests were mentioned as being in studio.

[00:04:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  These are words.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Oh, David Chase is a genius.  Oh, David Chase is a genius.  Oh, David Chase is a genius.  Wow.  Thank you, David.  That had to be the best season finale I've ever seen. 
[00:05:00]  I want to thank both of our you guys Impey, the team's been a blues.  And the first thing I've ever seen.  Sure.  Yeah.  But I want to thank David Chase.  It had every element I was looking for.  I want to thank David Chase.  It had every element I was looking for.  produces yeah thank you david chase thank you it was fantastic uh well worth uh staying up for  the perfect payoff for uh the perfect series bomb voyage sopranos you you went out in true style 
[00:05:30]  i like when uh things end like that and you have to kind of figure it out for yourself  you know what i enjoy yeah we're creative people yeah i'm getting a writer's uh a check they're  sending me a check because i have to figure it out for myself and write my own ending well we're  creative people but we can't even compete with the creativity of a david chase no god is he brilliant  die what was the cliffhanger there wasn't one die do people stay awake for this yeah and i'm just 
[00:06:00]  mad that i got uh i got pulled back in you got roped in well because i gave up on the sopranos uh  i don't know i guess officially like two seasons ago i'm like i'm done with this i'm done with  storylines that go nowhere people that are huge huge characters and just disappear and they never  come back it's like i was done with the show but of course you know you got to watch the the finale 
[00:06:30]  finale so i got pulled back in and of course it ended that way like jimmy said of course it ended  that way it that was the way it was supposed to end it sucked first of all the entire episode  was uh a bore fest uh you know ah frank vincent getting shot was kind of cool and it's you know  the little comic twist of his head getting run over was interesting and then everyone puking at the 
[00:07:00]  gas station yeah yeah i i laughed at that that was that was uh interesting i i think also uh and  we'll be talking to frank vincent in about an hour hour and a half yeah paulie um uh and the cat  paulie's problem with the cat that just kept staring at uh christopher's picture was kind of funny  and creeping him out yeah that was kind of funny but the rest of it i i oh thank god i i'll tell you  this much thank god we finally got to you know get to know uh what aj's all about aj a little more  thank you david chase thank you because that's what i wanted in the final episode ever of the 
[00:07:30]  sopranos is to get to know aj a little more you know because aj gave a crap aj before last night's  episode was on screen maybe a total of three and a half minutes in eight eight seasons so why not  spend the last uh episode of sopranos focusing on aj after holy crap after his suicide attempt which  was very good they should have moved on and kind of kept it focused on what was happening with  these wise guys even frank vincent's hit was i was uneventful i know what it should have been it 
[00:08:00]  was it was very uneventful there was no build up if you remember uh of course one of the most famous  hit scenes ever uh was in uh the godfather when michael walks into the restaurant and does mccluskey  and the turk i mean the tension that was building up during that scene that was a beautifully shot  beautifully written scene this one was like hey frank vincent's going to make a phone call  you saw it coming a mile away yeah and uh he gets out there's no bodyguards there's no anything 
[00:08:30]  like it wasn't realistic enough well because in real life i mean that's how it would be thank you  david chase your brilliance is just oh oh god it was so how about you how about you take the final  episode of sopranos and you share it with your artsy friends in your chateau somewhere you realize  you're on hbo you dope you're not doing a little art film that a hundred people are going to see  they said the whole country stayed up last night we're all tired to for that crap they shot a bunch 
[00:09:00]  of uh endings how about you you show us a few of them how about yes we'll we'll pick and choose  which one we want as the ending because the one you picked stunk and then he doesn't even have the  balls to like just end it with them at the diner table at the table ordering onion rings or eating  oh they were eating the onion rings opiate it's very important to the storyline yeah i'm sure that  symbolizes something in david chase's world i'm sure clogged arteries what what does it symbolize  i think it's symbolized like communion almost man really yeah that we should all have our hearts 
[00:09:30]  checked what what were you trying to say there because we don't know we're not smart enough to  understand you david chase and there's speculation that um this had to do with tony's uh conversation  with bobby when they was talking about getting hit uh and and uh tony says well you know you don't  even see it coming and everything just goes black so they're speculating that's what happened tony  looked up got popped in the head and you pretty much saw it from his point of view from that moment 
[00:10:00]  everything just went black that's it wow but again it's just speculation but what man had come in  i like the 40 minute parking job with meadow that was interesting that was so interesting i'm  sitting there going park the car oh my god no cut the wheel the other way you know why i was  yelling the same stuff anthony just did because i'm looking at the clock going oh my god you're  gonna wait three minutes left three minutes left will you park the stupid car park it right that's  exactly what i was doing well the dvd extras they show are going in and out of the cones for her 
[00:10:30]  driving test gave a crap dude exactly who cares i'm on the couch and when they were in the diner like  we all heard rumors the final uh shot was uh uh shot in like either an ice cream parlor or a diner  yeah and i actually got off the couch and got on my knees in front of the tv i'm like oh this is the  final scene this is what i heard that they they filmed it in a diner so i'm getting ready and of  course like every other dope in america when when the tv went black i was on i was dvr'd it and i had 
[00:11:00]  to rewind to watch the frank vincent hit again yeah so my stupid brain i'm thinking because i rewound  i i messed up like the the recording of the show that's what everyone i'm one i'm one of those  dopes i really thought there was something wrong with my hbo uh i think there was a collective  you gotta be s and me because that is exactly what came out of my mouth first there was stunned silence  i'm sitting up in bed and i'm all psyched that something's gonna happen and here's what i thought 
[00:11:30]  i thought meadow was outside parking her car yeah she's gonna be a little late to the party there  uh and during that time uh the entire family through some you know bad tactics in the hit  to make sure they get tony they have like multiple gunmen bullets flying everywhere the whole family  is just gonna end up dead uh just in time for meadow to run in and see her dead family laying there  and then we get a 10 years later and you see meadow like uh as a doctor or something the end the i the 
[00:12:00]  i thought anything but what i saw that screen went black i said you got to be s-ing me and then i'm  sitting there my girlfriend just laughed she started laughing and just takes like her glasses off and  rolled over to go to sleep as she's chuckling yeah and then i just continued for 10 more minutes  is that what what did i just see i'm saying what did i just watch it was horrible it was it wasn't 
[00:12:30]  well done that would have only been a good ending if they show that he was about to be killed and  they don't show the hit like if they if they ended that with two guys definitively he's dead yeah  right that wasn't that she walked into the diner and they had onion rings that's what happened  right oh onion rings okay god damn that was great then lord of the rings ring something  right a ring is a circle of life ah so it brings back that clogs arteries the beginning well yeah 
[00:13:00]  but it it brings you back to the beginning the onion ring symbolizes the whole circle of what the  what the ah it stunk don't stop believing it was actually more boring than the original journey video  what was that i started singing along to the song because i i haven't heard in a while i'm like  hey this is cool wait a minute this is i'm gonna there it is i'm like all right i like this song  there it is wait a minute there's 30 seconds left in the episode 30 episodes pass me another onion ring 
[00:13:30]  tony's just gonna snort and eat onion rings and then of course it was don't stop don't stop don't  stop and then whoa it stopped and then it stopped what word play in the music oh no he was messing with  us with the music all along like that episode what uh two weeks ago when the music's over turn off the  lights see the music is over yeah they just turned off the lights oh god what the is this 
[00:14:00]  onion rings pass me a onion ring look there's some coming into this place are they gonna shoot me what  the and fade to black and cut the end not even fade to black cut to black the end wow well uh  david bian cooley or i don't even know how to say his name it's just the daily news after all the hype 
[00:14:30]  and expectations about last night's final episode of hbo's the sopranos the mob drama series didn't  end with a bang it didn't even end it just stopped ah serious creator uh david chase who wrote and  directed the finale apparently uh chafed over the years at all those people who complain about  loose ends on the series not being tied up dr melfi's rapist the russian in the pine barrel yeah  last night's ending or lack of one was a massive passive aggressive payback painful and funny at the  same time oh is that what we is that what we all deserved a payback for seven years of loyalty of 
[00:15:00]  watching the stupid goddamn show even though when it sucked that's what we deserve uh an inside joke  so him and his chums can laugh at us yeah he's in a chateau in in france right now is it he's not  taking any calls he's shacking up but um it wasn't good it wasn't good it was slow it was lazy writing  it wasn't good it was lazy editing anthony was talking about how oh god edited with a chainsaw that 
[00:15:30]  it was all it was so choppy and and disjointed they would go from one storyline to another they're  making up new storylines 10 minutes before the end of the show right and it was just hacked together  like they would show a quick scene with stupid aj and then go off to uh uh some of the the mob story  and then tony and then it was cut horribly and uh someone brought up in the office that 
[00:16:00]  some of the scenes were filmed in winter somewhere in summer it's snowing or it looked like it could  be summer or spring sitting outside with t-shirts on i loved how i loved how last week's episode ended  with tony in a in a bed with a gun with a gun and then this episode he's out and about  yeah they're all stacked up in the safe house with a gun because they're they're people looking  to kill him but and then i'm gonna go out yeah the threat's over i guess like aj just uh you know  has girls coming over to the safe house because you know that's how it is yeah or whatever uh and 
[00:16:30]  speaking of aj and the the hot piece of ass he was with in the suv yeah that that went on fire  like anthony said the least you could have done was you know give us a little show us a little  booby shot booby shot i mean that one is more more exciting than the stupid truck exploding and  the way they tease that the speculation i read last week or the week before whenever the the  last episode was um people were like well did you see there was a big explosion because you saw this 
[00:17:00]  red light shining on aj's face and he looked shocked at what he was looking at so i'm saying  that terrorists bomb new york and that's how it ends because he sees a big flash of light  because you saw it reflecting off his face and it ends up being his suv parked and leaves  nothing it amounts to nothing i i was digging the music they played last night but you know if i if  i want to dig music i'll turn my ipod on yeah getting to hear a little young uh bob dylan and uh 
[00:17:30]  just three dog night and then uh and the radio station boy that radio station's here in new york i'm  sure all morning long they're going to be bragging about how they were part of the season finale of the  sopranos jim kerr and the mornings at q 104 yeah congrats to the q yeah the q got a huge they get a  moment in history on the worst season finale ever for their jukebox radio station congratulations run 
[00:18:00]  with that will you will you guys play it all day i mean uh mash they all uh went home two and a half  hour finale on network tv it was fantastic right in a mental institution yeah there's a chicken  clucking turns out it's a woman killed her baby killed her baby to shut it up in a bus yeah that  was that was a great finale and and it ends with them leaving that's it mary tyler moore there you go  turn out the lights take one last look around the newsroom sniffle and you'll leave the end the end 
[00:18:30]  not that even stupid three's company they all left that stupid apartment absolutely while they have  today scooped john redder up off the floor with two's company roommate needed  david chase went for the seinfeld ending you know seinfeld they're just still hanging out in  that jail they're in jail just yapping they're just yapping about nothing great thanks david i don't 
[00:19:00]  want to be a pirate i'll acknowledge it you're you're just a brilliant man what a genius we should  all be just happy that we're in the same world as you man being lazy and losing that stupid losing  the focus and making political statements about that's that was just that was lazy and it was cheap  it wasn't what the series was supposed to be about it had not yeah exactly and all of a sudden you're  starting a new storyline with aj they said he had to uh they had to drag him to the typewriter to um 
[00:19:30]  uh finish it the typewriter maybe that's why he should have had a computer but they had to drag him  to to finish writing these because they kept offering him money and he's just like i don't want  to do another season so they make him do another season and he just got completely lazy well so uh  they should have dragged him to a chateau and said you stay here we'll finish this yeah we'll finish it  thank you we own the show we'll finish this last week was such a great episode like bobby getting  shot and see like it was interesting yeah there was a climax to it you cared about what was going on 
[00:20:00]  every minute it was a great episode and then to follow up with this crap this one i'm a half hour  in i'm watching it's 9 30 and i'm sitting there going all right we're a half hour of all this crap  now we got to get the half hour of action and then i found myself going all right we got 20 minutes  left 20 minutes is enough time to really tear it up tear it up 15 minutes is fine right i could live  with 50 i could live with watching 45 minutes of this crap as long as the last 10 minutes 10 minutes 
[00:20:30]  left this is going to be one of those conclusions where 10 minutes makes up for a whole five minutes  how are they going to fit this in in three minutes she's parking the car with two minutes left  park the car park the goddamn car and actually what it's give me the remote something happened  that was the entire episode for me is that the reaction you really wanted was all of america go  what's wrong with my cable no do you realize that there's a bunch of dummies including ourselves out 
[00:21:00]  there that need a little more than i don't want to interpret things i hate interpreting things i don't  like having to write the end of a show or a movie there are movies out there that you watch and then  all of a sudden the credits start rolling you go what what what what yeah that was that and that's  when you usually get a guy in a movie theater yelling that's bs yeah come on a movie oh the village i told  i said that story when the village ended the guy can stand up that's it that's it come on that's bs 
[00:21:30]  and then the whole freaking audience just starts applauding this guy because everyone was thinking  that you get all pissed off oh yeah well i'm sure if david i'm sure david chase you know uh  showed that ending to all his pals and they're all like oh god oh dude it means so much oh you  outdid yourself this time my friend is david chase gonna go on a tour to every single hbo subscriber  and explain it to him is that what's next actually that's they're doing a new series it's called 
[00:22:00]  meadow uses regular unleaded see what happened is oh wow wow okay the whole gas crisis thing  uh-huh terrorism because of our middle east uh dependence on foreign oil yeah because of her  awful driving and if she learns to drive will no longer depend on foreign oil if she can parallel  park or she was burning more gas than she should have now i understand you see how big that space was  for her to parallel park come on park the car there's two minutes left i i thought the episode  was gonna end with her getting a ticket because her tire was up on the curb yeah it was set up like a 
[00:22:30]  hit was about to happen of course and then the anti-climax of not the hit i get doing that if the rest of  the episode justified it but there was no if he got hit you would have been like okay he's only being  hit because it's the last episode there was nothing in the episode that led you up there was no tension  that's stupid no bodyguard you tell me philly tardo in the middle of an all-out mob war  yeah he's gonna be hanging out with his twin grandkids yeah it was yeah it was lazy it was a 
[00:23:00]  lazy episode very lazy instead of being a finale just think of it as just another sopranos episode  it's lazy yeah it's an episode that should be followed up with another crappy episode but it  won't be right right that's pretty much it it's like uh uh the old uh show dallas it's like oh who  shot jr uh well that no that was the season finale that's it we don't know right imagine if they  ended dallas like that instead of the next season coming back and actually going into who who did it  you know those famous cliffhanger uh uh c uh not uh season uh finales not serious finales and they 
[00:23:30]  come back the next season and you find out what happened i thought it should have been aj that shot  him basically saying look he can control everything around him as far as the mob goes and he even has  the feds under his control but he can't control his own family very good aj sure he's not a script  supervisor that was terrible work yeah a terrible job last night man but they uh they had onion rings  oh and his and his car explodes my god because of a possible mob hit no because of a marijuana 
[00:24:00]  cigarette and they and they teased that they teased it last week where they showed that scene  and you're thinking oh man the suv's blowing up there's a big you know that was a hit yeah they  put a bomb in the vehicle well this is what some of the people on the streets are saying this is the  scene everybody will talk about today and tv critics and historians will talk about for years to come  the last minutes of the eight season long series the sopranos the worst episode ever why the ending 
[00:24:30]  election a cliffhanger it's the worst i thought my cable went out really that's what my brother  thought you know right his brother thought that he thought that and look they were by no means  the only ones many people saying they thought something had gone wrong with their reception  not the case it was just the end of the show i i got a i got a phone call from kenny what you know  one one of the members of the philly crew and uh he's like dude i'm hearing that there's six 
[00:25:00]  different uh uh uh finales or uh endings six different endings and and depending on what  time zone you're in it's going to be a different ending across america no no he's right actually on  the west coast he and his family are eating fries um in the midwest they had uh celery sticks dipped in  a ranch dressing and and if you're in the buffalo areas they were eating buffalo chicken wings you know  just trying to keep them nice and local yeah local sure but uh there there you have it man 
[00:25:30]  really badly done yeah plenty of people here in north jersey where the show was filmed commenting that  perhaps this is the end going to a beginning that is maybe a movie in the works like an onion ring  what does that to see all right well you know we do live in the world of the sequel you know shrek  three this three so i wouldn't be surprised thank you james uh sopranos three what is she talking  about idiot it's a series we live in the world of the sequel the sequel what is she talking about 
[00:26:00]  here's a great season finale probably one of the best ever bob newhart waking up from his new heart  show oh yeah yeah the new heart in show and then he wakes up and he's in bed with suzanne plichette  from the original new from the original new heart show dream that was an amazing brilliant funny  ending to a show because new heart wasn't a snot who thought he was above his audience and who was  trying to prove like you said how brilliant he was he was doing his job and being brilliant was was 
[00:26:30]  what made him great as opposed to trying to show everybody how smart he was although for some reason  serzanne plichette was like oh just go back to sleep bob like something happened to her voice between  the old new heart and and the ending of that one yeah i think throat cancer bob go to bed with a tranny  right all right we got to take a break uh yeah let's go to the phones and see what people thought  of the final episode of the soprano oh yeah eight seven seven two one two five seven six two we got  lots to do today it's opie and anthony this is the opie and anthony show

[00:30:00]  uh bird in philly new new heart was great because it was all a dream man man and it took you off  guard though it was a big surprise how does saint elsewhere end oh god it was some autistic kid  looking into a goddamn snow globe yeah yeah yeah yeah that was a weird ending too what do you mean  saint elsewhere ended with like an autistic kid looking into a snow globe something correct me if i'm  wrong so the whole show was his just imagination the head of surgery over there like the big muckety 
[00:30:30]  muck at saint elsewhere comes home from a day's work and he's got a toolbox in his hand he's just some  kind of like working joe who has an autistic kid and the autistic kid is holding a snow globe with i think  it's got like uh the a miniature version of the hospital inside of it and it was him imagining i guess that  his father was this big doctor and and and all the characters yeah all made up in an autistic kid's 
[00:31:00]  head when his father in reality was just kind of a construction worker that's a dad it's something  different it was different you know definitely got people talking and it wasn't um look i imagine  it wasn't just cutting to black i imagine it's really hard to end these uh you know these shows that  we all know and love but uh i'll give us something a little better than what you did last night david  chase steven asked for basher just uh what i wanted to see in the final episode of a show you've been  watching for nine years a shot of little miss sunshine on the tv yeah yeah that got me too 
[00:31:30]  and what the hell is that the thing with the snow globe is kind of like because you look back over the  whole series and go did this kid imagine that boring little romantic thing that never went anywhere  like you look back and go nah yeah what was that that was a like kid imagining it yeah all those little  storylines that just kind of that a waste time i felt the broadway number would have been lovely  last night like tony and the family and phil leotardo could have done some type of a  you want to be an artist david chase your fruit why don't you do something like that 
[00:32:00]  broadway a broadway number everyone's dancing except for phil because his head is crushed  so his feet are tapping uh we're gonna have frank vincent who had his head crushed last night on the  show hopefully in the next half hour or so uh bill in chicago listening on wckg what's up bill  good morning gentlemen oh bill when i first when i first listened to you this morning i was so excited  to go home because i dvr'd it i can't wait yeah talk about david chase being a genius i thought to  myself here we go this is the best episode ever and then as you guys progressed i i found out that i 
[00:32:30]  can't wait to get space back on my dvr yeah we were being sarcastic sir well because i know because  that's what his friends were telling him that he's just a genius but you know what though you guys are  phenomenal i'll say it again whoever does the wire and again they're in season four they're coming to  season five they could screw it up but uh really well done and the season finales are always pay off  they let you know what happened to everybody because look it is television you are invested in the 
[00:33:00]  series so you should wrap it up and you don't have to wrap it up like a hack but you should wrap it up  it's what happens at the end of the season yeah yeah i mean david chase has to realize he's on hbo not  not on the you know ifc channel or something yeah people have uh been watching this for years  uh they deserved some kind of an ending i think i think he copped out he didn't he knew people  weren't going to be satisfied with tony getting whacked or him living i think he knew that like what do  we do because it's one or the other everyone boiled the show down to it ending with tony living or 
[00:33:30]  dying that's it and he like kind of copped out by not doing either just kind of leaving it hanging  there yeah all right let's go to jason in jersey jason hey good morning boy good morning uh i was  basically gonna say what jimmy said man i just really really hope they don't end the wire like  that man i think freaking david chase might be a little autistic after that episode last time  the wire is such a just a well-written show they don't take lazy turns like that i i think i 
[00:34:00]  told you a broadway number what they should have done is they should have had the whole cast  singing the uh the milford plaza song you remember that commercial for the milford plaza the hip  hooray and valley boo the worst the lullaby of old broadway they should have all just been singing  that in the street as passersby watched and the milford plaza is the lullaby of old broadway  and the the valets singing and dancing they should have done that yes frank vincent squished head 
[00:34:30]  a big tread mark through his face aj and his new therapist on the back of a flatbed doing therapy  singing you didn't know what was happening who cared god almighty meadow parks aj talks  singing onion rings could do a kick line out behind him just it was dreck stunk stupid meadow  trying to parallel park who cares awful uncle jr stuff was great that was great when he had no  teeth and you're like wow he really is a doddering old he really just kind of or was he that's what 
[00:35:00]  they're saying in the paper oh was he oh no he was he said you don't know who i am do you and he goes  no what we did that's nice that's nice uh let's say hi to chris in boston going all over the country  today to see what uh you thought of the sopranos ending uh chris what's up hey man what's going on  hey hey i don't know why everyone is so surprised around here for the past three years they've been  doing nothing but swinging purses at each other and here it turns into a lifetime episode it's 
[00:35:30]  at this point i had so many years invested in it i had to have you know it was it was pot odds is  what it was that was hot odds you're committed you were pot committed yeah we're all frustrated  but jimmy walked in and said that's exactly how it should have ended because that's how the you  know there was no surprise there that's how the sopranos have been for years disappointing yeah but  but but we're what we're saying today though you take the episode just as a regular sopranos episode  it sucked yeah it was it was it was very lazy last week was great that bobby bakalas shooting 
[00:36:00]  you finally saw right yeah how great was that fantastic and it showed you what uh the rest of the  episodes how crappy they are because that one was so good yeah that one was action-packed they  should have peppered a bunch of episodes like that in get some new guys have you build up a  relationship with them and then have them get killed or or kill people or you know just something  i'm embarrassed for myself that i got off the couch and actually got on my knees in front of the tv 
[00:36:30]  like oh here it is here it is i gotta get close and safe about a half hour ago well i heard the final  episodes in a diner here it is here it is i'm sitting there in bed and then everything little  thing that's happening you're getting all excited and getting like butterflies going oh here it comes  here's the big finally the ending here's what everyone's going to be talking about  and now stay tuned for what john next on hbo john from cincinnati yeah okay so cincinnati 
[00:37:00]  john's coming in to kill him what happened right what jumpers no it's over i even sat through the  credits waiting for like one of those ferris bueller things yeah yeah it's over that's right come on  shut it off go i thought something was gonna happen i was halfway through john from cincinnati  going no they're definitely gonna go back to it they gotta go back this is a new marketing thing  hbo's doing yeah i thought they were gonna pull one of those things where everybody was gonna wake  up and go that's so dude you didn't stick through the credits dude you didn't see the credits  that said go to hbo.com for the real ending oh it was hidden in between the music credits oh it was 
[00:37:30]  a bloodbath oh my god i i was stupid enough that when aj walked into the diner i'm like oh it's gonna  be aj here it is oh my god he's just gonna pull out a gun and shoot him right between the eyes  it would have been more of a climax if tony was on his way to the dentist and he twisted his ankle  do you realize you're right that would have been more of a climate would have been some sort of  injury you'd be like oh now his mouth is hurting and his ankle hurts poor guy and all of a sudden 
[00:38:00]  carmine is snitching they don't even tell you his arrest all of a sudden like his carmine who cares  yeah hey hey lisa from west palm this is great because i did the same thing go ahead lisa oh yeah  never i've never in my life analyzed a journey song so deeply  i was like the movie never ends look how on and on and on and on what do they mean by that yeah it  goes on and on and i felt like that stupid seinfeld episode when they were uh analyzing the song um  yeah oh which one was that uh oh they were yeah what witchy woman with no no they were just analyzing 
[00:38:30]  the song no they didn't analyze that song i just had it my head to and lost it yeah someone come up  with it but uh lisa you're so right on broadway and then i'm like wait yeah that's it what's it  what's the next part of the song from journey maybe that just solves everything  it goes on and on and on downtown that was it downtown see the tula clark's downtown they just 
[00:39:00]  analyze it over and over trying to figure out what someone meant by it yeah and is singing it  it's the same thing you're sitting there with stupid journey going like what what does it mean  i'm listening to the words man it just goes on and on see it's like real life there's no endings in  real life life just goes on man like like an onion ring it's just kind of just yeah it's a circle  circle of onion with some fried batter and a and a daughter that can't parallel pork 
[00:39:30]  what did that have to do with anything nothing what was our parking what did it have to do with  it and if you want it to be like real life how about you don't waste our time filming it you just  tell us the diner he'll be at we can all watch by and peek through the window right i bet you the  anxiety people felt because stupid meadow couldn't parallel park caused heart attacks last night i was  sure and the heart attacks were because oh my god three minutes left that you can't parallel park  i was sure i was sure when uh when aj started up his new beamer yeah that that was gonna explode 
[00:40:00]  ah well of course well i thought something was gonna happen david chasing a chateau in france  somewhere is like that's that's what i wanted you to think another baguette please oh david you're  brilliant you're brilliant david yeah everyone's talking about it it's just uh which is true  everyone's talking about it well that's what i was trying for that's what i was gunning for 
[00:40:30]  got them all they would have talked about it no matter what because it was the last episode yeah  it didn't matter would you rather have them talk about it and everybody saying thanks it sucked  yeah i wish tony would have just talked in an old yiddish accent for no reason the entire thing  his whole time he talked like that and they never explained more yarmulker but nobody acknowledges  the yarmulker like it's been going on for eight years yeah i won't wake up in a mental hospital  like they're just a bunch of kooks thinking they're mob guys i mean anything i could come up with a 
[00:41:00]  hundred of them throw us a bone right make them jewish and never explain it right don't don't explain  and have all the other mob families talking to tony well and they're jewish yeah and all they can  talk about is all wearing yarmulkes uh i'm just reading all the reviews here paulie walnuts has a  yarmulke that's like black on top and gray on the sides nobody's paulie walnuts  uh they're talking they talk about the music in this review uh this was no accident the song tony 
[00:41:30]  chose to play on his tabletop jukebox uh was journey's don't stop believe in the last words  we heard on the sopranos were journey lead singer steve prairie singing and repeating don't stop  and then everything stopped and and then he writes music has been the only uh clue to where  chase was heading with this ending earlier in the episode aj and his high school girlfriend who  never got naked at least give us that yeah we're listening uh appreciatively to bob dylan's it's 
[00:42:00]  all right ma i'm only bleeding including a line of dialogue that chase clearly took to heart i got  nothing ma to live up to what's more the final episode opened uh to the instrumental strains of an  old vanilla fudge cover you keep me hanging on no doubt another defiant song uh choice by chase no  it wasn't defiant what it wasn't defiant how is that defiant these idiots are reading into something  that that the way that ended was the way you cut a home video a wedding video you put music to it you  go the words match up the screen not when you're ending one of the biggest tv series in the history of 
[00:42:30]  television yeah you don't do it with some cheese ball song lyric tie-in like like i said a little  earlier david chase reminded me why i gave up on the sopranos about two seasons ago and you know a lot  of people gave up on the sopranos that the numbers were way way down into the last two episodes uh you  keep me hanging on no doubt another defiant choice by chase and last week he even prefigured things by  having the bada bing girls dancing topless to the doors when the music's over when the music's over 
[00:43:00]  jim morrison sings turn out the lights last night to put a final punctuation to the sopranos that's  exactly how chase ended things oh what ass wrote that just trying to david buccolini or however you  say his dumb name i don't care i hope he backs over his own face with a lawnmower that buccolini i hate  him but uh yeah it doesn't matter what songs he played any song would have been overanalyzed it didn't  matter who cared about the music i can put my own stupid thing i can go on my my my mac and and do my 
[00:43:30]  own little program which puts music to it that's how you end the sopranos yeah dennis in uh new york  dennis hey guys good morning hey first of all jimmy you're a genius that's ridiculous lady ended six  feet under was done so much better and actually i would i appreciated watching the show last night  i never saw six feet under they uh what are they fast forward a few decades or something like that  i didn't see it yeah i didn't see that one did something i i forget because i that that wasn't a  show i watched uh regularly but they what did they do there they showed how every character died 
[00:44:00]  like that shows wow they did every main characters they fast forwarded x amount of years yeah that's  great that's a good one from a few years to a few decades whatever how long would have taken  yeah i saw that guy one time getting into a car someone goes yeah that's the guy that does like  who writes the uh or created and writes the uh six feet under he's supposed to be like a really  brilliant writer of course i never saw it let's go to mark in brooklyn mark hi i thought the show 
[00:44:30]  totally sucked everything you guys said is correct i think people who watch tv want to see drama not  reality and this is perfect proof that the reality behind mob what you see on television is more  interesting than what david chase wrote well like they were just saying oh uh and i think he's making  the point of hope was it was how great it would be other other things ended with no climax yeah like  why have a climax if you want to be such a brilliant guy yeah the godfather the whole scene where  michael goes in and uh and shoots a mccluskey and uh the turkey goes into the bathroom he comes out 
[00:45:00]  looks at him sits down and they eat onion rings and then uh the screen just goes black or the big  or the big moment in that scene is when michael grabs for his chest and he goes uh captain mccluskey  do you have a tums biogen is really bothering me from all the sauce you got it kid gives him a tums  yeah and then they chit chat about the game somebody drops a meatball on the floor to thuds and they all  laugh let's go to uh mike in munaki hey guys how you doing mike from munaki hey by the way we got 
[00:45:30]  frank vincent after the break all right the only good thing about the episode and we're not just  saying that because he's calling the show that was a really good scene right scene uh let's go to mike  what's up that was the biggest waste of an hour of my life last night they should have wrote in david  chase and whacked him on the show yeah well the new york papers i would love to uh to see what the  rest of the papers are doing this morning but the new york papers uh one wacky ending as in a whack 
[00:46:00]  whack nice how's the italian food here not too good let's go somewhere else get out of here let's grab  let's it's a little fattening let's go to a vegetarian vegan place yeah yeah do you know  where one is lou uh yeah nice work lou or if he should have the italian food it's lots of stuff i  wouldn't know i'm a rough foodist i only eat vegetables and then michael and him talk about  that and then uh new york post the sopranos tony and the gang whack fans that's true when linda 
[00:46:30]  stacy i don't even want to know what she had to say i don't either maybe the only dead thing is that  hand in her photo uh let's go to arthur on johnny fontaine stars in that picture okay all right  that's right horse is fine everything goes along beautifully instead of a horse's head they put  like a horse hair wig in his bed and he wears it he runs around he's a tranny jack waltz a very  unpassable tranny arthur sonny pays his toll he has easy pass easy pass that's that's gate goes up 
[00:47:00]  he just drives through that's the hackiest joke i've seen probably 12 comedians do the same joke  they invented that one and then it was my bit really well they're doing it out there  he wouldn't die if you had easy pass i made a little video about that they wouldn't have to stop  and then uh maybe carlo and connie go to marriage counseling and they work it all out right everything's  fine all right two more before we uh break and then get frank vincent on uh arthur what's up 
[00:47:30]  carleone gets some fruit brings it back to the compound right but he sees a little worm popping  out of the apple and fredo brings it back club soda fredo you don't want to get fruit here papa  it's bruised  arthur go try to jump in here good morning i think i think we were all duped and we learned that  the spirit of andy kaufman must have entered david chase because we're all the brunt of an andy kaufman 
[00:48:00]  joke yeah it was very a little bit thank you arthur let's go to stew in philly stew what's up  hey how's it going hey i want my money back from cable for these last seven years i want somebody in  the philly south philly mob or the new york mob to whack david chase and blah when did you realize  you're running out of steam with this one coming back anytime soon oh no all right listen we got 
[00:48:30]  frank vincent calling in so let's take a quick break it's opie and anthony  ah good morning to you  it's the opie and anthony show everybody wants to talk about the sopranos today 877-212-5762  a little later on we're gonna beat up al roker a little bit a little bit a little bit a little bit  a little bit also give away some o and a traveling virus comedy tour tickets for jones beach jones

[00:49:30]  bye-bye say goodbye to grandpa say bye-bye say bye-bye bye-bye then you get popped in the head  frank i'm thinking new t-shirt what i'm thinking new t-shirt for you  i got them phil leotato's no but i mean you know say goodbye to grandpa t-shirts  right on it say bye-bye say bye-bye to grandpa and you could have another one  with uh with your head with a big tire tread through it yeah i'm uh i'm doing a uh commercial  for michelin producer that was uh your hit was great man yeah it really was because you know 
[00:50:00]  i mean we all saw it coming a million you know a million miles why why didn't you have a bodyguard  with you why did they give phil leotato a bodyguard well because they didn't want to get killed  they wanted him dead yeah the uh the shot to the head was uh was great the hand just coming out  out of uh this into the frame and uh shoots you and then uh in in just a sick kind of funny in a way 
[00:50:30]  a twist the the car is in drive still and uh your head gets run off slowly uh slowly rolls you just  hear it crush and then there's a few brothers hanging around by the uh gas station who start to  throw up one of them starts throwing up but you know they were made made reference to my hair  all through the show for the all the years yeah yeah something about the hair with the silver hair  guy or something yeah so it kind of got a little must yeah yeah so that was uh that's david's way 
[00:51:00]  of eliminating that so so frank now that the the series is over and you don't have to kiss david  chase's ass or anything what what did you really think of the final episode well i thought it was  all together man i mean he closed it all off everybody you know he he it showed you you know  he wound up like like a family i mean what'd you think of it i i didn't know now frank did you  know it was going to end like that until you watched it i knew it was going to end like that  but i didn't i don't i don't know how it's going to look when they put it together okay i mean i knew 
[00:51:30]  all the stuff about the cat i know i knew i knew everything you know we read the script but you don't  know that you you just imagine how it's going to be yeah the thing the thing is i think a lot of  people were wanted something more i think i know a lot of people wanted something more than just that  cutting to a black screen before we know actually what's happening uh did he is he supposed to have  gotten shot all the shady characters walking around the restaurant does he just have dinner with his  family i mean i think the uh the viewers might have been owed a little more of an answer here you 
[00:52:00]  know well that's up to david chase man you know you know he he's uh he lives by what he does and  yeah i understand we can't we can't understand his brilliance man yeah he's ultimately very very  brilliant i guess you gotta watch it a few times and really get a good taste of what he's what he's  saying to you it was just weird frank they kind of went into a direction like i would have rather  have seen more of your being in hiding or more about stuff like that which was a character that 
[00:52:30]  i was really invested like aj we knew for a long time and he did i thought his suicide was kind of  like or suicide attempt and then he kind of goes into therapy was kind of the climax and the answer  of his character and then the more interesting stuff of bakala being shot last week and then  you being on the you know hiding out while all this is going on i i just didn't i think he tied  it up very well i thought it was i thought it was kind of uh just poorly tied up well aj you know  aj became successful now i mean yeah you know and the girl was successful and she couldn't wait to get  to her family she wasn't successful she couldn't parallel park last night frank it was driving us not i'm 
[00:53:00]  sitting there going park the goddamn car there's three minutes left three minutes left in this thing  what kind of car was that a lexus that's the one that parks itself the four corner thing all right  oh really yeah and it couldn't park itself what happened you know what david chase should have done  obviously he wasn't going to give us a a lot we we knew that much but he should end it with your hit  then that would have been a nice ending yeah yeah right well we think it's going to be tony getting  shot and somehow it's you like right just give us something like like just where we could talk about 
[00:53:30]  today and go wow awesome steve from bay shows checking in frank's a new book a man's guide to  being a pancake head what's a hat you can wear while visiting your gum or a little thin one  we come over there you guys oh so you uh i mean obviously do you guys know like in that they  actually gave you the honest ending in the read-through yeah absolutely we read the ending we are did you 
[00:54:00]  question it did you say what is what does this mean what first of all you don't question you don't  question second of all you don't know how it's going to be put together you know yeah you hear it  you talk about it uh the cat thing what did you make of the cat thing i thought it was cute yeah it's  definitely it was it was cute and everything but did you did you was there some kind of something i  should have picked up on that that i'm too stupid to pick up on well david is a very uh you know  he's very deep guy and he just uh i guess he's looking at the picture and uh yeah that wanted 
[00:54:30]  to make you make you remember him i mean i guess there's a lot of messages there if you really  really diagnose it i thought paulie was just nuts paulie it's crazy just shows you what an ass paulie  was but that was funny i want that cat out of here he's like all pissed off at the cat right  trying to hit it with a broom well frank how did how do you think uh it really ends then what do you  think happens when the screen goes dark i think it's just tony and his family yep and they're  together and it's all those troubles all those troubles uh he still has all those troubles he 
[00:55:00]  made tony he made paulie the captain now and uh his business he got sort of lined up phil's gone  threaded that but still he's looking over his shoulder he's looking at everybody that comes in  that store yeah the feds the uh people that might want to kill him yeah yeah i mean it's uh  it ain't an easy thing to end this and the final look was him just seeing some you know uh metal  come through the yeah he didn't look he didn't look um upset when when you heard the jingle of  the door opening up and him looking up like it was somebody maybe coming in to take a shot at him 
[00:55:30]  right uh i think it was a lot of paranoia he had of everybody that was in the place sure but uh so  you're thinking that's it he just kind of goes on with with his life and uh business as usual two years  from now you'll see something else like the soprano movie or something you never know oh you  never know is it oh no you never know has has there been give us a little scoop here has there  been any talk with any of the people involved in the show about a movie even if it's just i ever heard 
[00:56:00]  and that was a while back was a potential of a of a prequel uh-huh you know prequel you don't have to  go back in time that's right thing i ever heard about frank vincent confirms soprano's movie on the  anthony show right frank will be playing frank when he was younger frank will be they'll call  him old flathead frank oh there it is it was it was weird because like seeing you get shot was great 
[00:56:30]  and then you realize they had the big meeting but then all of a sudden carmine's just ratting like  you know apparently his kid got busted doing something and you didn't yeah he wants to save  his kid i guess which is okay but you didn't see any of it like developing they should have brought  big pussy back like he was never killed and the fbi guy was ratting you see the fbi guy yeah  yeah what do you mean the fbi guy you had the girl cop in the in the bedroom and he was telling tony  what was he telling him something uh about the but the russian guys are the terrorists yeah yeah and  he was also saying uh hey it looks like our side's gonna win yeah like uh like he had a whole personal 
[00:57:00]  interest in this uh uh war yep and also he told tony about the payphone thing yeah right right that's what  he told him he told him you know they got a message or they figured it out that he's calling  from the payphone he's paying back for the terrorism information i think right yeah yeah all right well  frank uh what's the book i understand you wrote a book guy's guide to being a man's man really what's  that about what is exactly in there that tells you how to be a man's man you know i mean sure we have 
[00:57:30]  music in it we have cigars in it we teach you how to smoke cigars teach you how to go to vegas teach  you what movies to watch how to treat a girl how to get a first date what's a vegas tip or something like  that because i i've been to vegas with friends and i never seem to do very well there the vegas the  best vegas tip you can do is get off the plane get back on the plane yeah that would be it just  yeah i used to say the old joke used to be i got off the plane i walked into the propeller that's  that joke but you can you can win in vegas if you really pay attention and do some money management 
[00:58:00]  yeah you got to be careful because they're going to take your money as simple as that gotta be patient  that sounds like a good book um like you know they did we tell you what songs what songs to play  while making love oh really oh wow yeah like uh frank sinatra's fly me to the moon of course then  we tell you what songs to play you know not to play while making love like uh celebration  well no you wouldn't want to do that don't stop believing  yeah you shouldn't stop too early are you a sinatra fan frank oh please yeah i mean come on i've been 
[00:58:30]  here's my problem with sinatra lyrically a little odd is sinatra odd oh no lyrically some of the  lyrics were a little odd uh there's a song about you better not make any calls from a gas station  there uh it's a good i just heard recently i was eating and what's that song a grace  wants some boolya bass and i'm like what is that i don't know i've never heard that grace  wants some boolya bass yeah it's about a party or something like are you being serious i'm dead 
[00:59:00]  serious and and and like there's like all these people like uh jake wants a weenie bake and grace  wants some boolya bass it's like a big party thing and like i just it's memorable i never heard that  one okay maybe you're not familiar with that one yeah maybe but not play that one not so all right well  we're big fans frank we hope you can come in studio congratulations on the finale man you were great  you were the highlight you really were great frank vincent uh rarely makes it through a tv or a  movie or something without some horrible thing happening to him yeah that's my thing it's my 
[00:59:30]  thing it certainly is these violent awful deaths and beatings he takes all that nice head of white  hair he's got just all bloodied up by a car tire and frank vincent hinted all year because he's been  calling us saying ah hang in there you'll see something cool with me you know what i want my my desktop  to be is uh frank vincent peering in that window going bye bye bye bye you looked adorable frank as  you're saying goodbye to your grandkids bye bye uh screensaver bye bye do bye bye screensavers i'm 
[01:00:00]  thinking or or flathead mouse uh pads frank vincent.com is frank's website check it out yes absolutely  frank uh thanks so much for checking in with us uh don't be a stranger now that the show's uh  done with either uh working i'll call you all right very good frank take care good luck bye there  he is frank from from straight from getting his head run over in the last episode of the sopranos  frank vincent our good friend uh no one from the sopranos doing uh interviews today they're all in 
[01:00:30]  hiding because no people want to yell and scream at him but frank vincent he he knew he had a good  scene last night so let me tell you something he's gonna be he wants to talk today i'm gonna analyze  that phone call a little bit all right i think there's gonna be a movie yeah he said maybe maybe  in a couple of years you know and a couple of years it takes you know a while to film these things and  get them all together and get everyone in place i think they're still i don't think they're already  talking about it you're a sucker i'm not a sucker i i just think they'll do it it's we finally have to 
[01:01:00]  acknowledge we can't be suckers anymore why you're if they put out a movie you wouldn't watch it it would  end just like last night's episode that's the problem you wouldn't watch it because we all would  go oh that oh they're setting up a movie and now we're gonna get everything answered in a movie  and then we're gonna see the movie guess what it's gonna be the same crap i wouldn't care if it you  know something i really wouldn't mind that ending if the entire episode was action and tying up other  loose ends and and and not so much on the stupid aj thing and like if they just would have had a real 
[01:01:30]  action-packed episode and then it ends like that you're like what the hell happened but at least you were  satisfied you know with the foreplay i think a lot of people would would be disappointed no matter  what david chase did last night but we have to say it again as far as the sopranos episode it was very  sloppy and it just wasn't good yeah it just wasn't good in general you're right the winter they're  sitting outdoors one minute it was snowing and then it's snowing i brought that up though my girlfriend  said well it was like snowing in april she goes it wasn't kind of crappy weather you know we did have a 
[01:02:00]  cold uh long winter like that so i but still it just was thrown together because then they're  sitting in t-shirts in front of the pork store not worrying about somebody driving by and shooting  them like it just seemed like it was chopped up and thrown together i don't know tor johnson walked  into a wall they kept it or johnson reference nice man his eyes would have trouble wrapping up a series  neatly let's go to eric in new york eric yeah i just i was surprised that they didn't play the alternate 
[01:02:30]  ending where tony goes to jail and he cries himself to sleep for three days and they let him out hey  that's a good one i love paris hilton did you see paris's sister in that tiny tiny little skirt  visiting uh paris over the weekend oh yeah yeah nikki right nikki hilton yeah nikki nikki hilton  went to the prison to go visit uh paris and they showed a picture of her she's wearing a skirt 
[01:03:00]  where i swear you you could see uh what's going on exactly what a short skirt her long thin legs  and she's walking into the joint like that hey uh we gotta acknowledge that um steve's going crazy  by the way what's wrong one of our guys is going crazy i'm like beyond creeped out by the way you're  frank vincent got a new haircut he's sporting a flat top 
[01:03:30]  here's our own steve coming into speaking of um uh grooming and hair stop with the hat here comes  steve oh what are you doing no no that this is how steve came in today um if we can uh let me spin  the uh yeah pal talk camera around steve's one of our guys having pal talk here one of our guys  who likes to kind of groom himself uh what are some of the things you like to do there steve just to  uh yeah it's maybe talk about the grooming let's see uh i have the uh the the well you lost you lost 
[01:04:00]  a couple hundred pounds because you had your stomach stapled i'm incredibly vain and you know and and  so i do things like lose a hundred couple hundred pounds by getting my stomach stapled i'll trim my  beard like painstakingly yeah way too much work i yeah i it's for me it's a goatee or just shave  right but you you carve out yeah i carve out a goatee he's one of those guys that has to carve out  stuff he does the cool guy in the boy band beard cuts right right i really gotta have the real thin 
[01:04:30]  like i respect the people the guys out there that do carve out stuff but it just works too much work  man for me and and i'm very hairy guy and you're very hairy i uh shave my arms so i can uh be a  little bit less hairy on the arm region also shows off the tattoos right now you also laser some hair  off i also lasered some hair off the back it keeps growing back yeah it's supposed to stay off it's  supposed to if you keep going back the problem is i have that one tattoo on my back that you can 
[01:05:00]  you can't laser it because i'll burn the tattoo off so you just have a patch of hair that's thicker  then that's surrounded by all this thinner hair so it's just incorporate into your tattoo somehow  make the tattoo like a hairy thing well the chick writing the guitar on my back already has a full  beard because of all the hair growing to her face are you uh thirty percent probably and he also  works out it's the rest dachshund how many hours a day do you work out uh hour and a half a day  every day every day half that's crazy now what's going on with the hat being pulled down he's got 
[01:05:30]  his we've never seen him wear a hat right maybe maybe on a couple occasions okay he's not a guy  that would wear a hat in general the brim of his uh baseball type cap of course it's a foundry music  cap with the flames on the front of course is up it's pulled down very low over his brow  and uh we were trying to figure out why and um he spilled the beans as to why he's wearing that  right take the hat off for jimmy 
[01:06:00]  see  look jim just get a good look look i can't see you  your lights blocking what happened he shaved his eyebrow something amiss something went  okay so it goes like this he's got the whoopee goldberg yeah i have whoopee goldberg eyebrows at  the moment um i uh why would you shave your eye i have a an electric beard trimmer that i use to  carve out the beard okay and i have in the past used it to reduce my bushy eyebrows and no one has 
[01:06:30]  you know and and i've done it carefully enough so no one really notices so it's just so it trims  them but i was not paying attention and didn't adjust the stupid you know uh what's the the little  height adjustment a little height adjustment on the thing and i whacked one of them off yesterday  completely and as my mouth is just hanging open looking at my one eyebrow and one full  i gotta call you out no it's i swear to you it wasn't by accident you decided that you wanted 
[01:07:00]  a close eyebrow shave and then realized wow this looks really dumb you wanted to have a closely  cropped brow so you could have funny dude i got razors and stuff and i make sure i mean you triple  check quadruple check to see what uh you know what what's what's even better is he realized when he  he did the other one because the other one isn't as short yeah the other one he's got one  non-existent eyebrow pretty much on his right eye and then over his left eye it's a regular eyebrow  a little short exactly hence the and believe me if if if i really wanted it this short i would 
[01:07:30]  absolutely admit to it and say and you wanted it that short you definitely were going to like shave  it down shorter than you usually do and realize oh man this really looks bad i say i say we get a  sharpie and and sharpie in that eyebrow that's missing and i say we get crutches for the people  who even come near me with a sharpie wow wow what does this mean how long it take you to shave them  how long does it take my girl back if you shave hopefully hopefully they'll be they'll be back in 
[01:08:00]  by tomorrow well he's lebanese so yeah exactly i was praying to jesus that i would grow them back in  overnight you know putting rogaine on my eyebrows why just shave them totally off because that would look  really dumb instead of mostly dumb which is what it looks like now it's it's i believe me i shave  your eyebrows what's wrong no no not even your no no no there's nothing wrong with it no there's  nothing fine about it i'm not shaving my eyebrows there's a way you run the razor over your complete 
[01:08:30]  eyebrow that's it's a beard trimmer it's a beard yeah yeah you do it with a height adjustment so you  just go boom and it shortens it up and because my eyebrows if i let them go will grow into my temple  so i i've done this you're a chimp so i've done this a bunch of times and no one's ever noticed  i get those like an occasional wild like three hairs that'll come flying out but but never i  never let him get to that point you know if you just like take your finger and kind of push up on  your eyebrow you could see the ones that are kind of poking up further than the other ones and you take 
[01:09:00]  a little scissor and go click click click click click see i learned i've never that never would  have occurred to me and you you but then you don't have to worry about because the guy the thought of  taking a razor over your eyebrow it's just too risky he's a grooming freak too risky enough with  the grooming man i know i know sideburns coming down to the jaw line well the sideburns i figured  out they're cool sideburns i figured out the beard i figured out the eyebrows apparently i need to  stay away from steve's got a cool look he does except for the except for the stupid missing eyebrow  now let's go to cigars and scotch cigars and scotch what's up hey steve come clean i know where you 
[01:09:30]  are on the weekend he was shooting a remake of pink floyd's the wall and any blood in the sink  no just eyebrow hair i have a couple of wacky ones that stick up like little antenna and my  ex-girlfriend hated them so yeah i remember those yeah you refused to cut them yeah because they look  wacky were you using them as a prop on stage she would hate them yeah you'd rub her cheek with  yeah i said look aren't i like a scientist yeah but my eyebrows like i said they'll grow into my 
[01:10:00]  temple and even my barber takes a takes a beard trimmer and goes like over here and does all this  stuff because my hair is so thick it'll my my eyebrows will grow into connect into your temple  and if that happens the world he's wolf boy he really is you're like a wolf boy we gotta take it  ever happen uh uh let me uh break this one open uh when i had long remember when i had long hair when  you'd shampoo your hair and then steve had long hair at one point you ever have i called it a wild 
[01:10:30]  hair uh up your yeah it was it was you'd be shampooing and then later on you'd kind of feel something  ticklish so you'd reach down to your undercarriage and a single hair from your head will have worked  its way down your back and into like um the uh uh uh crevice area so you reach and pull and the  sensation you would get you'd go like either that or you get one that starts choking your uh unit 
[01:11:00]  never get that oh my god my unit's trying to commit suicide it's called the wild hair up your  or it's not a wild hair it's a the pube of a friend  no it's got to be when some people go i never had that happen it's got to be when you have like  shoulder length hair yeah it happens so girls girls have it or what you have when you're in a band  and yeah you know and trying to wash that greasy mane right and then you pull you pull and it's  like whoa because it works its way right through everything exactly all right we're gonna get into

[01:13:30]  a douche he's a fat irrelevant uh weatherman yes where's that article i gave it to you jimmy okay  he's uh he's a hypocrite absolutely he is now um the imus thing when that all went down everyone  what imus thing everyone had a lot to everyone had a lot to say about imus right yeah and al roker  was one of the very vocal vocal uh people out there uh saying that imus needs to be fired and then when  when he was fired he was very happy that imus got fired for saying what he did yeah because uh 
[01:14:00]  imus was uh simulcast on on msnbc yeah al roker is on nbc yeah and uh they took um what al roker and  supposedly other employees uh had to say uh seriously and to heart and when they voiced their opinion that  they wanted imus fired uh msnbc fired don imus right so al roker was a big part of that and he was  blogging like crazy he wrote i for one at the time he wrote i for one am really tired of the 
[01:14:30]  diatribes the humor at others expense the cruel wow he did say this thank you god thank you wait  till you hear what uh mr roker did i for one am really tired of the diatribes the quote humor at  others expenses the cruelty that passes for quote funny don imus isn't the only one doing this but  today he's the one in the hot seat well really is he ow way to go ow way to put your big fat foot in 
[01:15:00]  your fat mouth it's funny how al wasn't tired of his own network uh using cho's pictures and and  manifesto yeah yeah i wasn't tired of that well he didn't speak up when that was all going down  because that would mean his job but he went after a safe target at the time imus because everyone was  piling on so why not let the fat guy pile on last so what he said was violent disgusting it denigrated 
[01:15:30]  an entire team and by extension a community and its pride in a group that had excelled don and his wife  have done a lot of good things raising money for charity including a ranch for children suffering  from cancer and blood disorders yet don imus needs to be fired for what he said and while we're at it  his producer bernard mcgurk needs to be canned as well mcgurk is just as guilty off an egg and imus  on you're not listening to a best of by the way uh we're here now it's june uh 11th we'll get to  the point in a second here just want to refresh everyone's memory what mr uh al roker said about  imus this uh this was all going down this next line is great from al roker and remember all these 
[01:16:00]  things we're saying when we get to uh the story here yeah he says the i'm a good person who said  a bad thing apology doesn't cut it remember that al roker saying the i'm a good person who said a  bad thing apology doesn't cut it at least he didn't try to weasel out of this by hiding behind alcohol  or drug abuse still he said it and a two-week suspension doesn't cut it it is at best a slap 
[01:16:30]  on the wrist a vacation nothing really citing com context within a comedy show is not an excuse  better say that again again really loud al roker commenting on don imus uh citing context within a  comedy show is not an excuse he had to take his punishment and start over guess what he'll get  rehired and we'll go on like nothing happens cbs radio and nbc need to uh news needs to remove don 
[01:17:00]  imus from the airwaves that is what needs to happen otherwise it just looks like profits and ratings  rule over decency and justice what he's just he's emotionally a hack yeah he's a blogging hack well  there's a reason he's supposed to just do the weather exactly turn the umbrella upside down and and eat  like whipped cream out of it if you go into a diabetic coma fat boy yeah let the others do all  the heavy lifting spent a whole career not being poignant now you want to chime in so i and a lot 
[01:17:30]  of people associated with the show and a lot of people out there uh remember all those things al  roker said uh during the whole imus situation and i'm reading the papers over the weekend there's a  little article yeah very little it was not front page it was buried in uh you know a saturday  paper who reads saturday's uh paper for the most part but it says uh joker roker sorry joker roker  they're calling him joker roker and he's he has to say sorry he's sorry and i'm thinking to myself 
[01:18:00]  about what did he give a bad weather forecast or something perhaps he said rain and it didn't rain  and you didn't make plans oh i see that must have been it what else could it possibly be he made a  little joke that backfired on uh the today show a joke was he joking about a a high pressure system  moving in when actually a low was coming in or something weather related right and usually when  i see al uh roker the paper i'm like i i don't even read the article because i'm like what could he  possibly have have to say about anything but when it when it says joker roker sorry i'm like oh this 
[01:18:30]  piqued my interest let me read further and it says al roker apologized yesterday for joking about  epileptic seizures on thursday's today show oh now remember what we just read you from his blog  about that was it context within a comedy show  was it uh is he a good person who said a bad thing you hypocrite but wait a minute he doesn't like  quote cruelty that passes for quote funny right right right well who are we to say maybe uh it was in 
[01:19:00]  some kind of context let me read on remember that uh controversial olympic logo for the 2012 olympics  in london awful yeah it is awful terrible uh some folks have complained that the campaign actually  sent them into epileptic seizures roker said on thursday's show uh-huh so setting up a little bit  that's just news because uh people with flashing lights and various colors and uh shifting shapes 
[01:19:30]  uh have been known to set off epileptic seizures in certain people so that was the news story it  looks like he's setting up a very funny line here a little joke maybe because he writes joker roker  because you know and it's set up like any other comedian out there he says remember that controversial  olympic logo so there's gonna be something funny hey i gotta tell you remember that controversial  logo out there hey i gotta tell you something anybody remember charo  he's setting it up here it comes tee it up al yeah here's the setup for a doozy huh doozy here comes 
[01:20:00]  al's doozy so strap in so he basically says remember the logo that was uh you know uh uh sending some  people into epileptic seizures yeah al roker continues well we asked you to weigh in on in our in on our  website in an informal poll and then he says those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking  around were able to actually log in what a douche 
[01:20:30]  so he's making fun of a whole group of people it seems quite similar time is now doesn't it what he is  doing is making light of a disease that many people have and suffer from right and is do not  find funny right uh and that's what he was doing making light of other people's affliction right to  try to make a joke now al following your own blog i'm i'm waiting maybe today's the day that you 
[01:21:00]  resign from the today show i'm a good person who said a bad thing does that fit you uh al in that  situation uh are you citing context within a comedy show as an excuse which you don't think should be  an excuse perhaps you're doing that right he's a liar read that read his explanation it's it's  it's oh i know it is more despicable than what he said is his explanation a liar how about this  he's a liar you're right blog uh about imus that starts off i for one i'm really tired of the 
[01:21:30]  diatribes the humor at others expense the cruelty that cruelty that passes for humor talking about  an epileptic uh could you picture uh a mother of an epileptic child cradling the child as they're  uh having a seizure on the floor uh and then uh uh al roker comes out with this statement do you don't  you think that's cruelty that you're trying to pass off as funny because he doesn't just say get up he  says after shaking around shaking around on the floor right they can get up and and cast their little 
[01:22:00]  vote on the website so his excuse by the way like jimmy said is nothing but a a lie watch right you're a  lying sack of crap with this excuse i assume he's gonna resign today i assume he should he should  follow his own advice that he had on his blog and and other people that work with him at nbc should come  out against him like he did against imus right and call for his firing uh i for one i don't care 
[01:22:30]  i think the guy should keep his job because for one of course i think things like that should be  able to be said of course uh whatever you should be able to try to make funny out of anything but  if you're gonna blog and call for someone's firing and actually succeed in getting someone fired  perhaps you ought to live by the same rules and not use uh humor like that at other people's expenses  cruelty that passes as funny uh don't cite context within a comedy show and uh uh don't say you're a  good person who said a bad thing right right right can we read his revolting lie of an explanation 
[01:23:00]  yesterday roker said he was sorry and uh this is al roker's quote i started joking about it i want  to make this clear i was not joking about epilepsy or anyone who suffers from epilepsy he said at around  804 a.m while he was delivering a weather report from milwaukee that's what you should be doing  whether in milwaukee milwaukee weather we understand and know that this is a serious  affliction would never and would never joke about that we were joking about the logo not about  epilepsy liar liar i hardly and really humbly apologize first of all if anyone was offended 
[01:23:30]  it's not we it's i fat boy yes what is the we and second of all if you weren't joking about the  epilepsy what in the logo where it says you you say that it actually uh causes people to go into  epileptic seizures and then in the next line you say get up off the floor after shaking around  how can you lie everybody knows it was an epilepsy joke you dope if it was about cancer and you said  people shaking on the floor people would go what what that doesn't make sense and and he was talking 
[01:24:00]  about people casting votes on the website and the joke was the fact that people with epilepsy  wouldn't be able to cast a vote because they'd be shaking on the floor and having seizures this has  nothing to do with the logo you're not joking about the logo you're lying to try to save your effing job  is what you're doing you're a liar you're insincere the we thing isn't we it's i because you said it 
[01:24:30]  it's funny out because you don't know anyone that have epilepsy right see see how it works  you're a liar this is the type of stuff he probably says when the cameras aren't rolling and there's no  tape rolling all the time just like uh normal human beings do they bring up uh these uh uh dark comedy  and and taboo subject matter and the second uh he does it he comes up with these excuses right wasn't  making fun of epilepsy yes you were shut up fess up to it you lion sack what i want to say i think al 
[01:25:00]  uh roca has learned how easy it is to just try to entertain your audience and and and slip that's all i  missed did that day perhaps all he was trying to do perhaps now al you can see that it's not as easy  how how it how it happens right al it's not that easy when you're working uh off the cuff and just uh  kind of rolling on live tv or radio uh that that something might slip out of your stupid mouth and  you might say something and should it then cost you your job because you did indeed do something 
[01:25:30]  extremely insensitive there are a lot of people out there you made a a joke that could be considered  cruel uh and now you're trying to apologize and blow it off like you weren't goofing about it  you're not even sincere in your apology you're not even sincere and then he says if people were offended  people were offended don't say if you were offended by it i apologize say that people were offended i  apologize uh uh not we the guy's a liar he said uh let me make i want to make this clear i was not 
[01:26:00]  joking about epilepsy we got the actual yes you were al why don't we do this let's hear it here's uh  roker here's him making the actual comment love to hear it and a little update on a story we told  you about yesterday remember that controversial olympic logo for the 2012 olympics in london while  some folks have complained that the campaign actually sent them into epileptic epileptic seizures  others say it's just downright ugly well we asked you to weigh in on our website in an informal poll 
[01:26:30]  and those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking around uh you were able and uh and  they're laughing hysterical laughing what what oh laugh and laugh what's the difference between  this and what mr imus did exactly don't call up because i'm not going to even you know entertain  you entertain what you have to say with that and why it's different because there's no difference  and honestly i don't care al roker should be able to say that imus should say whatever the hell  he wants it maybe now al roker understands how this the this type of crap could happen i'll tell 
[01:27:00]  you how it's different and why al is even more repulsive because imus's job is to be funny yeah  he has the pressure of being funny for four hours a day this fat lump well who should have had lipo in  his head to make it because he looks like a pez dispenser now who couldn't stop eating uh is not  supposed to be funny your job fat boy is do the weather yep that's your job do the weather stand on  umbrella it's raining you don't have to be funny the guy's buying his own hype he thinks he's like 
[01:27:30]  this this star now he thinks he's a celebrity a big star you're a weatherman you're a glorified  weatherman he's probably not even a meteorologist which upsets me i think all weathermen should be  meteorologists here's a big california raisin head here's the al roker apology i do want to take care  of one thing though oh do you look at that aside it's like an aside oh by the way uh since i got a  little extra time uh i do want to take care of one thing how about you have to come out right on 
[01:28:00]  the top and give a sincere apology i do want to take care of one thing though uh yesterday at this  time we were talking about that that 2012 london olympics logo and how hideous it was and how people  were being suggested that they were they were having epileptic seizures by this thing and well i started  joking about it and i want to make sure i want to make this clear i was not joking about epilepsy or  anybody who suffers from epilepsy what holy you're a lying i want to curse so bad i want to call him  the lying sack of he's a liar he's a liar you're being a liar you're insincere that is the most 
[01:28:30]  insincere piece of drivel looks like someone's trying to save their job a little bit i've been  doing stand-up for 17 years and when you set something up with campaign actually sent them  into epileptic seizures and your next line is get up off the floor and shaking around there's no  human way you weren't joking about epilepsy so be a man and tell the truth you can't that would take 
[01:29:00]  about he's he's america's darling they love looking at him all the rubes that watch that show love  looking at him and and uh uh oh boy look at the non-threatening black guy that's going to do the  weather for us this is fantastic we love him they can't turn those people off so he lies so he lies  anybody who suffers from epilepsy uh we understand and know that that is a serious affliction and would  never joke about that joking about the logo not about epilepsy anybody was offended by that i uh 
[01:29:30]  hardly and and really hardly apologize he hardly apologized trying to make fun of anybody uh who  suffers from that affliction in their family so if you were offended i apologize yes you were clear  let's take a look show you what's going on as far as your weather is concerned that's what your job  big city of the day happens to be milwaukee wisconsin the brew city you're a liar he's a liar man plus  the fact okay apologized all right good yeah you get to keep your job because you apologize right oh no 
[01:30:00]  that's right i misapologize he still got fired and he didn't even apologize no he said if you were  offended i apologize but you shouldn't be offended because i wasn't even talking about that but he was  then why would you apologize if you didn't make the joke where is the outrage where are the postings  of that uh audio i want that audio posted posted online somewhere i want to give out mbc's notice  who can call and complain who might be offended there you go might be offended i think people should 
[01:30:30]  let mbc know they're offended by al roker's despicable comments this son of a bitch is lying  you just heard him lie you heard the line he was absolutely joking about epilepsy and then he says  he wasn't he was talking about the logo shut up you liar and of course uh which makes this more  interesting the blog about imus yep everything he says in there is just complete hypocrisy  yeah i mean instead of a you know you could substitute uh al roker for imus and al roker's 
[01:31:00]  blog yeah just substitute i'm really tired of the diatribes of humor at others expense of cruelty that  passes for funny uh al roker isn't the only one doing this but today he's the one in the hot seat in  the hot seat what al roker said was violent disgusting it denigrated an entire team and by  extension a community and it's pride in a group that has excelled al and his wife have done a lot of  good things no you can't put that al and his wife as far as i know done nothing that would probably  yeah i have no idea what they do he ate all right how about we move on to this yet yet al roker needs 
[01:31:30]  to be fired for what he said the i'm a good person who said a bad thing apology doesn't cut it at least  uh al roker didn't try to weasel out of this by hiding behind alcohol or drug abuse  well i was trying to that didn't work still he said it and a two-week suspension doesn't cut it  citing context within a comedy show is not an excuse he was trying to make a joke cbs and  uh nbc news needs to remove al roker from the airwaves that is what needs to happen otherwise 
[01:32:00]  it just looks like profits and ratings rule over decency and justice this is al roker's words  because there's no there's no special interest group like there are for racial groups who have  become such babies there's no special interest group for epileptics that are screaming in the  media so we probably know safe making an epileptic joke that's how it works right out completely safe  making an epileptic joke and i would love to just pound on this get that audio up somewhere  uh not to get him fired but just to to reveal this for what it is this is the same situation 
[01:32:30]  that don imus was in he said something off the cuff like that just trying to throw a line trying to be  funny and it offended some people and he apologized but it wasn't good enough for some people and one of  those people was al roker who was at the forefront from what what i uh heard uh at nbc for getting  don imus pulled from msnbc uh al roker's name came up as one of the guys that was was at the forefront 
[01:33:00]  they are talking to the president of the company that this is an awful thing and it makes the company  look bad well what do you think what do you think you just did al roker the same goddamn thing and  instead of fessing up and apologizing for it like a man what he did was try to bury it and say that  it he wasn't even goofing on epilepsy when it's so obvious he was the exact thing that don imus did  it just when i read that over the weekend i was blown away yeah blown away because he was so vocal 
[01:33:30]  when the imus situation how would some of the sponsors feel if they knew al roker was making  epilepsy jokes and i think he should be fired why because it shows a consistency consistency there  you go if some people have to stay between the lines and watch what they say or else they'll  they're uh threatened with their jobs being taken away i think everybody should have to adhere to the  same standard and al roker is one of those people he's in the media uh he's got a huge viewership of 
[01:34:00]  people and uh he absolutely offended people and wasn't even fessing up to it uh in his apology  and he should be fired more than don imus should have been absolutely because he's not even doing  a comedy show we're doing a comedy show believe it or not every day we try to do a comedy show it's  unscripted and we're just uh flying by the seat of our pants and now al roker has learned the hard  lesson that sometimes you just screw up trying to entertain your audience he's a real member of the  media like he's a legitimate member yeah he reflects like he said about imus reflects on the entire  organization meaning nbc and that was his point is that don imus made nbc the professional nbc look 
[01:34:30]  bad well what do you think you just did al roker with that with that line hey uh let's uh bring  let's oh what they uh uh yeah hold on let's bring some faces in story ideas let's bring some uh some  faces into this story brian and queens go ahead hey good morning guys how are you good what's up man  make it quick there this is hearing you guys talk about this as i'm driving i want to pull over and  just rip my effing hair out because this fat bastard my mother was killed from epilepsy she 
[01:35:00]  had a seizure in the bathroom and she broke her neck there you go al uh but it's funny to al roker  yeah yeah see and i want to make it perfectly clear we think you should be able to say whatever  the hell you want on tv and radio within fcc regulations whatever but uh you know if al's  gonna uh call for imus's head and then he turns around does the exact same thing well where's  the outrage live by the same standard where's the outrage al your mom died of this now let me ask you  a question do you do you think that uh when he says something about the uh about the olympic logo 
[01:35:30]  being an epilepsy epileptic seizure then falling on the floor and shaking around do you take that as  a joke about epilepsy absolutely i i didn't think it was fun i thought it was tasteless i didn't think  it was funny um i i love you guys show in the morning and and i'm glad you guys are kind of  bringing it up but when i when i heard it the other day because it was brought to my attention by my  sister who also suffers from the disease we were both really really offended because my mother had  epilepsy she's been six years old and she died by the time she was like 59 so try and deal with that 
[01:36:00]  on a regular basis as we grew up and watching it basically deteriorate herself yeah it's really  horrible now you've you've actually seen you know your mother or maybe your sister have a seizure  correct oh my god a million times yeah and and and did did the image that al roker conjured up  did that make you feel good i mean where he's talking about hey if they could stop shaking on  the floor to get up and cast their uh vote you know did did you find that uh at all funny i didn't 
[01:36:30]  find it funny and i was more upset by his ignorance because evidently he's never been around somebody who  had epilepsy before because you have no idea the horror and the shock that you go yeah i say there you go  i say what al roker uh did is way worse than what i missed it way worse well the nbc switchboard i  mean why shouldn't people make their voices heard why shouldn't there be a consistency with the network  standard there should be you have a pen dude if you want to tell your story you should tell it to nbc  yeah dude do you do you have a pen brian two one two because i think if because if i i think people 
[01:37:00]  like you who are genuinely hurt by this should uh have your feelings known to uh nbc yeah because this was  buried in the paper over the weekend yep kind of like imus's thing was kind of buried and then  someone brought it to everyone's attention yeah ah what's the number there two on two yeah six six  four four four four four very easy to remember two on two six six four four four four four that's the  nbc switchboard in new york two on two six six four four four four four so if you want to call 
[01:37:30]  up you should tell them what you just told us do because uh why should he be able to make disgusting  remarks like that and then hide behind an apology that's not even honest be uh be professional be  polite and just voice your opinion on this thing and uh talk about things like um how uh perhaps  the sponsors of uh the program uh would be upset with al's comments how uh you being uh a victim in 
[01:38:00]  this too with your mother and sister having epilepsy um do not accept his apology and uh you want this  taken further and you're you're uh uh upset about the way the story was buried and about his  insincere apology that was more of a lie than an apology because he was indeed goofing on epilepsy and  not uh the olympic logo um and and and see how how al takes all this see if he uh goes on an apology  tour buckles under see what nbc management does i want to see if there's a double standard here maybe 
[01:38:30]  i will go to someone suggesting he should tour hospitals and see uh you know people with people with  epilepsy and meet and have to sit and meet and speak with people with epilepsy and and uh be educated  on uh on the subject yeah i would like to see that happen yeah so that disgusting i would respect him  at least a little bit more as a man if he told the truth when he apologized he lied he was trying to  weasel his way out of it without taking any responsibility for what he said and when you're  on live tv or radio that seems to be the thing now every word that comes out of your mouth you're 
[01:39:00]  responsible for and have to uh uh take uh the heat for if you slip up and when you're just trying  to entertain your audience al broker is learning that lesson the hard way there you go see how wow  see how easy it is to do this hey al it's a it's easy ain't it you just get on and you blurt things  out and then when if you say something mistake you just uh half-ass cover it with a uh insincere lying  apology and you go about your business right oh well i missed it and because you have made a big to  do about that didn't you remember the guy that was doing the weather report and he meant to say 
[01:39:30]  martin luther king jr but oh my god he didn't even say the word he goes martin luther king jr i'm so  sorry that was a sincere apology by a weatherman who honestly made an error a dumb mistake and  immediately tripped over his tongue and and a bad uh word a racial epithet came out half of one came  out right he was mixing up and unfortunately that's a that's like a close racist but king and  jr he was rushing he was fired before they went to commercial oh my god that day yeah where's the  double stay only because it's racial you can only be fired for racial stuff come on man apparently so 
[01:40:00]  he was fired before the five-day forecast well he was just wow hey the voice changed in the middle  five-day forecast yeah it changed on wednesday what happened he got through two days  they change in the middle of the five-day let's go to debbie on long island debbie i know we have to  take a break but this is very important to us because we love hypocrites and our broker is one of the  biggest ones today uh debbie go ahead hi good morning my name is debbie um listen i'm epileptic 
[01:40:30]  in fact i had a seizure last night i just i was just driving my boyfriend to work in the morning  well al roker thinks it's hilarious yeah seizure so ah you're rolling on the floor you can't even get  up and go to the computer shaking hopefully hopefully you got a family member that could dial the nbc uh  switchboard for you i was just explaining to my boyfriend how scary it is and this guy's joking  around about it how how dare he debbie's got one of those sexy like voices yeah you got one of those  like uh i was actually on the show a couple like a week ago about when you guys were talking about 
[01:41:00]  how uh how you should show cleavage at work yeah yeah good you know what but like i said about this  whole epilepsy thing that's not something that somebody should joke about if somebody would  actually say something like that to my face i think i would go and cry and then i would you know  probably end up punching the person in the face because that's not something i would have to deal with  it well this shouldn't be a double standard race racial or not racial if you're making fun of  somebody it's messed up like that hey look you want to you want to especially when you're going to  stand on a soapbox and pontificate about morality with humor to a guy whose job it is to be funny 
[01:41:30]  right your job is not to be funny stupid yeah your job is to tell us the weather tell the weather  legitimate media he's legitimate media that's why if this if this was just some guy that said this  i wouldn't even give it a second thought but when this guy got up on his soapbox and it collapsed  under his weight and he got another soapbox a stronger one a metal one and got up there and  just started calling for the firing of don imus uh over uh what imus said when you got someone like 
[01:42:00]  that you need to then put them under the microscope and uh thank you so much okay thank you don't uh mistake  this for ona uh sincerity as far as epilepsy goes no please we think you should we don't care  everything but now al roker has learned the hard lesson that this stuff happens well nbc switchboards  again be polite and just talk about the point i'm not saying attack them but just tell the truth about 
[01:42:30]  how despicable what he said was and maybe mention the sponsor it's 212-664-4444 that's nbc here in new  york and uh you know he wants to say that imus shouldn't say things and he shouldn't make  reprehensible comments and then not even be a man like imus wasn't apologize i can't say it enough  i know i've said it quite a few times it is the most insincere try to get out of trouble excuse for  an apology i've ever heard from a public figure this thing he didn't even fess up to what he said 
[01:43:00]  uh and then he said if you were offended like so hey look i didn't expect anyone to be offended but  if you were now i'll throw your bone and apologize even though i didn't say anything about epilepsy  like he he dodged the whole goddamn thing where this guy should have gone on there and after what  he said about imus he should have been on his knees begging for forgiveness right he said we were  joking about the logo not about epilepsy no then why would you that's how it started that was the setup  to the joke well here's the here's the apology i do want to take care of one thing though uh uh 
[01:43:30]  yesterday at this time we were talking about that that 2012 london olympics logo and how hideous it  was and how people were being suggested that they were they were having epileptic seizures by this thing  and well i started joking about it and i want to make sure i want to make this clear i was not joking  about epilepsy or anybody who suffers from epilepsy uh we understand and know that that is a serious  affliction and would never joke about that joking about the logo never not about you did you did 
[01:44:00]  you're a liar offended by that i uh hardly and and really humbly apologize that uh i know hardly  apologize uh who suffers from that affliction in their family so if you were offended i apologize  how about i dishonestly yeah let's take a look show you what's going to play the line again play the  line again and you tell me this isn't him goofing about epilepsy this is him goofing on the logo yeah  let's get these uh two clips up on our website will you yeah and a little update on a story we  told you about yesterday remember that controversial olympic logo for the 2012 olympics in london while 
[01:44:30]  some folks have complained that the campaign actually sent them into epileptic epileptic seizures  others say it's just downright ugly well we asked you to weigh in on our website in an informal poll  and those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking around uh you were able and you know the  people that are laughing they should be fired fired too for laughing they're egging him on he  said about bernard girk he said needs to be canned as well mcgurk is just as guilty often egging imus 
[01:45:00]  on egging that sounded like egging if you listen to that first clip when he first says when he's  giving the facts saying uh sent them into epileptic epileptic seizures you can hear somebody they're already  giggling so they're giggling and laughing so they the whole whoever was there that day should all be  fired you know if you follow the imus rules well the idea of somebody being sent into a seizure and  maybe like that guy's mother falling and breaking their neck yeah uh apparently is very funny to  these people if a logo sure it is why not make a joke about uh uh yeah cancer or heart disease or aids 
[01:45:30]  right go ahead make an aids joke al let's see how far you get with that let's say hi let's say hi to  lauren in jersey lauren we got to take a break but uh go ahead hi i just wanted to tell you i have  epilepsy and i didn't even hear of this until my boyfriend called me i was like put on lna they're  talking about seizures and i really think it's disgusting that even his apology that's one of  his voice doesn't even sound sincere right right he's like if if you're offended in epileptic seizures 
[01:46:00]  like it's a joke i mean how would he like it for making fun of diabetes and heart disease and  coronary disease and aids when he had the gastric bypass and he was so overweight how about this how  about tomorrow morning because they always have those stupid hello kentucky signs outside the  today show why don't people show up with signs about epilepsy and stick them right in this fat  face good idea show that on the network good idea let's get some people together yeah i'm gonna call  nbc thank you so much for putting yeah that number is two one two six six four four four four four two 
[01:46:30]  one two six six four four four four four and tomorrow morning you show up with signs outside that  studio why not i mean yeah he would be doing it if it was a racial thing right uh i think dougie there  on line one hey thanks a lot lauren thank you i think dougie on line one is a little confused though  uh dougie hey how you doing guys what's up man yeah first let me just say al roker is a fat ass and  on top of everything else it would be hypocritical for me to say that al roker should be fired right 
[01:47:00]  i think because that he is al roker he should be fired for what he said if he's gonna make a big  deal about imus he should be fired for what he said i don't i don't think he should be fired but i  think he should be held to the same standard as the people that he or the person that he got fired  he had a very key role from everything i read very key role in changing minds over at nbc as far as imus 
[01:47:30]  went and the reason that imus got fired from msnbc so why should he not be put under the same  scrutiny that don imus did if he survives it and holds his job that's it whatever but if if  he's held to the same standards and gets fired that's just the world we live in today and it's  very hard we have to adhere to rules uh as we sit here that are are far further than they were years  ago far more reaching than just fcc violations uh because of of people like al roker and and standards 
[01:48:00]  that have been put in place these moral standards that are put in place uh uh the fear of offending  people al roker is one of the people in the forefront that is in the public eye that that made  uh this worse because he wanted imus fired so why shouldn't he be put uh against the wall and have to  uh deal with the same standards and same uh criticism and i'll take it one step farther real quick is the  fact that imus was doing his job and imus was supposed to be doing stuff like that uh al roker 
[01:48:30]  did what was not part of his job yeah no yeah imus was no he went off script he's real media yep we  got to take a break but uh jeff you got to make it really fast because we really got to take a break  we're late yo's am i on yeah yeah go jeff real fast yeah my uh no this really does take me off i was  never a big imus fan i didn't care less but my brother committed suicide over 30 years of having  epileptic seizures i really would like you to re re uh put out that number so i can call 212-664-4444 
[01:49:00]  the nbc switchboard man the phones are lit we'll go right back to the phones after this it's opie and  anthony we're back with the opie and anthony show we got bear on the line very busy morning  we got dennis hoff calling in we're giving away a date for father's day to a lucky father out there  a date uh from what from where from who uh dennis hoff the bunny ranch out there in nevada where uh  dating is legal dating we want to do some nice father's day and this guy bear had a very interesting 
[01:49:30]  story and his wife was actually uh admits not having sex with him she doesn't want to have sex  in 12 years and he's apparently he's a dad he's got uh daughters like four daughters yeah it's like  why not help this guy out we'll talk to bear in a second and dennis hoff in a second but uh the  phone's just lit because of the al roker situation by the way there's an email address today at msnbc.com  that'll help all right today at msnbc.com that'll get your emails uh right to the people that need to 
[01:50:00]  see these emails about al roker making light of epilepsy yeah uh this from the man al roker who  uh went to the head of uh mbc uh what's his name the president steve kappas that horse steve kappas  he went to him and called for imus's firing because uh of imus's uh faux pas during his live broadcast  and what was the big quotes from al roker's blog about the imus thing again oh my humor oh yeah  because that's all i was trying to do is make a quick little joke right oh i guess so 
[01:50:30]  add a little levity to the program uh for one i for one am tired of the diatribes the humor at  others expense the cruelty that passes for funny this is what he said about don imus  yeah and then a mere what two months later he does the exact same thing uh the the i'm a good  person who said a bad thing apology doesn't cut it he said and uh citing context within a comedy show 
[01:51:00]  is not an excuse this man went to the head of mbc al roker went to the head of mbc and called for  imus and imus's staff to be fired called for them to be fired because the staff egged him on and all  imus was trying to do that day was entertain his audience just like al roker was just trying to  entertain uh the viewers of the today show with a quick little uh little joke little joke uh  they were talking about the olympic logo in london uh that the the apparently might trigger epileptic 
[01:51:30]  fits and al roker do you still have the clip had had this to say listen when he mentioned  epileptic fits before the joke somebody uh like in the back was as he could accuse bernard mcgurk of  doing egging him on somebody listen to the laugh when epilepsy is and the laughs when he gives his  punchline uh all those people should be held accountable it's it's just it's just laughing  but my god it's insensitive and it reflects on the entire nbc uh news organization yeah what what 
[01:52:00]  makes this different really that's what it does make it different why is the integrity of the news  what does make it different nbc switchboard 212-664-4444 just i want you to ask the tough  questions what makes this different than the imus situation mr roker a little update on a story we  told you about yesterday remember that controversial olympic logo for the 2012 olympics in london while  some folks have complained that the campaign actually sent them into epileptic epileptic seizures 
[01:52:30]  others say it's just downright you see the laugh there way in on our website in an informal poll  and those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking around uh you were able oh they're  all laughing hey fired fired fired fired fired those of you who could get up off the floor after shaking  around that is a joke about epilepsy it's not a joke about the logo she laughed listen to the titter  when he said the epileptic seizures so there was no joke he said a fact this might send people into 
[01:53:00]  epileptic seizures and she laughed where's the integrity of the news organization i want al roker  to go on and now acknowledge how how when you're trying to entertain an audience you can slip up you  might say things that's what i want to hear from al roker on tv i don't want to hear an insincere apology  i just what i was just trying to entertain my viewers i thought that would be quick and funny and i  realize how insensitive that was now i understand the same thing i just didn't go out to like uh you  know be he was just trying to entertain people that day he should absolutely go on and say i now 
[01:53:30]  understand uh the position uh don imus is in the position other live uh comedy shows are in when  they're working uh off the cuff like that including live right when they're working live um that things  like this do happen and i now see it in another another light in a new light and but he won't  he made up a phony excuse for an apology there's i'm sorry no no i was done there's nothing worse 
[01:54:00]  to me than when somebody makes a joke about something and says they weren't talking about  that it'd be like imus stop when he said what he said if he had said no i meant nappy as in sleepy  and i was saying hoes because i i was comparing them to garden implements right right just completely  that phonying up the apology would have been equal to the fraudulent crap that al roger said  all right with that let's say hi to deborah man it takes uh talking about epilepsy to get these  phones ringing what the hell's wrong with you guys deborah what's up good morning how are you good  good how you doing hey guys i work for the epilepsy foundation and i am a parent of a teenager with 
[01:54:30]  epilepsy so i'm really glad that you are giving a lot of time and attention to the issue of epilepsy and  the insensitivity that it's portrayed in the media and the general public this is like the  hardest thing that we fight against to educate the public is the stigma and the myths surrounding  epilepsy well you know what al roker doesn't think it's much of a big deal at all yeah al roker was  uh having a few laughs with his staff uh about epilepsy um and then of course he said he wasn't 
[01:55:00]  uh but we have the audio there's no getting away from it i think this is an opportunity for mr  roker to become our best friend and help us educate everybody about epilepsy and you should also  educate people on how you can slip up when you're unscripted just trying to entertain an audience  yeah because you know we you don't think we know we have bullseyes on our freaking heads here  and then we'll get into the next controversy just because we're trying to entertain a radio audience  and that's why we're taking this very seriously and calling out people like al roker and this is  these hypocrites another thing that's disgusting about it is people who tune into imus know what they're 
[01:55:30]  going to get with imus yeah you know what type of humor he does you know it's a comedy show the  today's show you're not expecting to hear that so people who weren't expecting stuff like that  were being assaulted this is definitely worse believe it or not absolutely not getting any  attention it was buried in the paper i i i read this and went oh well i'm not letting this go because  i remember what you said on your dumb blog so deborah do you uh did you write down the phone number  in the email address and the uh the email address write that down too it's today at nbc.com msnbc.com 
[01:56:00]  i'm sorry today at msnbc.com i'd encourage everybody to ask mr roker to do a little education on behalf of  the epilepsy what is step down like he no no he should step down he did exactly well not exactly i think he  did worse than imus he should following his own set of rules guidelines and standards he should step 
[01:56:30]  down i i'm not asking for his firing i'm saying he's the one that was at the forefront of uh imus  getting fired at msnbc which led to his firing from cbs so he should hold himself to the same standards  and resign right because it's a reflection on the entire organization yeah we don't just as he said we  we don't want people to be confused we think you should be able to say whatever the hell you want  on radio within the you know the government guidelines so but you know following what 
[01:57:00]  al said sure then he should definitely resign thank you there thanks deborah god bless let's go to lee  uh from long island lee what's up hey hey i just tried to call mbc it's really funny you really got  it going you can't even get through of course no huh well keep the pressure keep the pressure up  well listen i agree with you i mean this isn't about and i feel bad for the people calling and  it's great that what however you get this out you get it out this isn't about epilepsy this is about  this is about the guy being a hypocrite and he probably won't get fired because he's black 
[01:57:30]  well black i don't know if this is that much of a racial issue though they know here's where the  racial angle comes in and she raises the point a black guy making a joke about a special uh about  something that the special interest groups aren't vocal about uh-huh is much safer and that's why  the media wasn't talking about it because nobody cares and by the way the people laughing we do the  people laughing were matt lauer and ann kerry finally fired matt lauer found it funny i guess 
[01:58:00]  where was his apology unbelievable i totally agree with you guys oh this isn't about epilepsy it's about  the hypocrisy yep and it's also about being a legitimate news show or a show that that is that  is watched by people like that and making an epilepsy joke so it is about that too you know what i read  i read complaints on the message boards that said we don't let the callers talk i'm sorry go ahead we  take we take the calls we let him say three words and then all three of us just gang up and bombard uh 
[01:58:30]  and monopolize the conversation and then they try to talk and then we jump back in again well we get  excited and as i'm reading it i'm going yeah we do that you go ahead and talk i apologize okay not  you bitch  call i just say that you know i totally agree with you guys it's about the show it's not about  what he specifically said it's about being a hypocrite ah david what's up 
[01:59:00]  same point eight times that's why we jump in that's why we jump in that's why we talk over the  callers you dumb message board asses they gotta direct you this is not about the thing start  from beginning this is not about the thing we know these callers are in a robo with one paddle jesus  get another paddle let's move forward that's not funny in a circle how many times was she going to  say it's not about the epilepsy hypocrisy we got it barber sticker all right we're going speed round  here david go what's that funny we're we're speed rounding go yeah what's up yeah i was just calling 
[01:59:30]  to say that um the girl should laugh the joke was halfway funny she shouldn't be have a problem laughing  it's just al who should be held to those standards it was his blog that uh right right made him fired  but the joke was halfway funny well yeah i don't care about that i don't really care that he made  that joke who cares the point with her laughing is simply he was saying that bernard mcgurk was egging  on uh-huh we're saying hey man i mean that to me that's that though they're egging al on why  shouldn't they be held to the standards he held imus to right that's all we're saying today that's 
[02:00:00]  exactly that's exactly right except that she wasn't the one that was went to the head and wanted that  i'm inspired it was him yeah we know yeah we're exactly right yeah i hope people understand the  point we're trying to make today yep uh jennifer and philly what's up hey i love you guys i've been  waiting for the al roker thing to come up again always been a big fan of the today show never a fan of  imus until al roker started the blog if i don't like imus i won't turn him on that's what kind of  show he is but al roker i can't tell you the number of times he's had to apologize for inappropriate 
[02:00:30]  comments has he really i would love a list of other things he had to apologize for that would be  wonderful because we're not letting this one go no so sick of the hypocrites out there nope  wish i could think of specifics but i used to love them now i hate them and i wish imus i think imus  should be uh back on the air now well somebody should show up tomorrow morning at the today's  show like an epilepsy uh foundation or something like that because they have these live shots and  they're all clowning around and let's see if they show you on television like a bunch of fat housewives 
[02:01:00]  going hello yeah new hampshire let's see if they show a real sign with something he said let's go to  jack jack what's up not much bro i just want to let you know man i already called al rokers or called the  office and went to the voicemail just gave my great disdain for al roker seeing that i'm an investor  and uh i watch mnbc every day and i sponsor uh purchased their sponsors products but not anymore  and make sure people understand that uh you know you read his blog and he did exactly what uh what he 
[02:01:30]  was writing about in his blog about imus exactly i mean exactly you can't even it's not even open for  interpretation nope uh let's go to shannon in niagara falls shannon what's up hi this is shannon uh  i had just called the nbc and they're actually not even accepting the phone calls or the complaints  they're putting us straight through a voicemail okay they're probably like oh oh those opie and  anthony's are at it again well today oh yeah today at msnbc.com they have to see the emails piling up and 
[02:02:00]  you know what they still know you're calling right even if they're putting you through a voicemail  they still know that you're calling right and and and and ask and go uh we just want al roker to go  on tv and explain why this is different than the whole imus thing that went down that he uh vocal you  know was really uh adamant about and we know our pests are able to um get other email addresses that  might be uh pertinent to the situation our pests are uh very very resourceful so perhaps a few of those 
[02:02:30]  can get um on the message boards so yeah uh you know they could they could be uh uh informed on  how outraged some of these people are at what al roker said and he should be held to the same  standard and matt lauer and ann curry are guilty as well yes they should be held to the same standard  too laughing at his joke uh what does that do to uh matt lauer's credibility and the credibility of  mbc news my goodness if it had been aids and he had made an aids remark would she have laughed at  to mention an aids joke could you imagine al roker making an aids joke why not christ on a pony it 
[02:03:00]  would be over johnny all right we gotta take a break to catch up a little bit bear staten island  can you hold through the break you got it we're gonna get an update from you next all right and uh  i don't know if we have time for dennis off but we can promote the thing and get dennis on tomorrow  maybe yeah yeah i think that's what we're gonna have to do because uh the show is just flying by right  now it's opie and anthony opie and anthony

[02:05:30]  lady doing oh please did you did you now now bear uh we for everybody out there really fast  this you know a quickie on yeah bear bear and louise are a couple you've been married how long  almost 18 years almost 18 years they have uh kids four kids four kids and uh she just does not  give him any sex anymore haven't had sex in what 12 years bear 12 years 12 no actually it's probably 
[02:06:00]  closer to 13 it's when my 12 year olds were conceived like after a certain amount of time it really  doesn't matter so you know we're looking very very long time yeah 12 13 years no sex after after a  week it might as well be 10 who keeps track it doesn't matter and she she doesn't even care we we  talked to her and the the most telling thing i was thinking about this couple over the weekend  and me and my girlfriend kind of talking about him for a little bit and she was like when when  his wife louise when you asked her do you still love uh bear and she went 
[02:06:30]  she just made a sound my girlfriend was like that was just like oh my god so i appreciate the  honesty though yeah yeah i'm gonna bs about she's like ah i'm comfortable i i raise cats i got a big  house i got a job i got a big house and kids i'm busy i can't think about that kind of thing so  she doesn't even there's not an iota of sexuality left in that woman she does not want any sex 
[02:07:00]  no so so it's uh i i guess silly to say ask you if you got anything over the weekend  no no no let me tell you i work i drive a gasoline tanker at night i would careen it into an abutment  i would probably married to louise i would probably make it really good and uh go right for the  preschool drive right through why not yes sir can i take care of my kids see that's that's that's what 
[02:07:30]  he turns into with this woman this poor guy that's exactly what it is this guy i want to leave but i  can't i gotta raise my daughters i you know this guy's a bun this guy's made for the bunny  man they're hot chicks they're nice well we're talking to the front runner right now jimmy yeah  you are the front runner bear because uh if any if that's the window you know if any guy i've ever  spoken to needs to go out and have the company of another woman uh out there in vegas see a little 
[02:08:00]  excitement uh it's you because that wife of yours that louise has just she is asexual  there is nothing sexual about her no no no no because we asked her and she's like look i want  them tall dark and tattooed remember yeah but that's like this kind of that's like a womanly  soap opera fantasy she wants she wants like a uh a fabio fantasy where he comes up on a horse and  takes her away or stuff hey this guy bear he just wants the company of a beautiful woman uh for the 
[02:08:30]  night you know what i mean uh that's that's what he wants she wants some kind of romance and  all this bull crap that goes along with it and meanwhile she's just in the house with the kids  and the cleaning and gives her husband no no bit of sexuality or anything the beauty too is if um  if bear wins this date at the bunny ranch in nevada his wife already said that she would welcome him  back home and uh with over arms she's fine with whatever happens on on your date oh i'll walk there 
[02:09:00]  guy he doesn't even care about airfare hey bear are you walk can you come in friday i'm sorry sir  can you come in friday come in yeah all right yeah because we're gonna have some of the girls from  the bunny ranch and we're gonna have a little uh i don't know maybe q a or something then we're  gonna decide that'd be great but uh you know meet and greet you're definitely the front runner right  now i'm gonna play time i just gotta give my boss notice that's all yeah yeah uh uh clear friday

[02:10:00]  believe me as this relationship is is is unraveling before my eyes and it is what oh no our relationship  jimmy no i actually your my relationship with you and with anna is one of the longer more  consistently loving relationships i've had yes this is love oh yeah it is we spend five hours a day  together at three or five and uh we talk preferably three and uh i'm we're gonna have to agree to  disagree i think the ranch is perfect though because like they're not jaded they're like these are not 
[02:10:30]  girls that are kept there by force or by some nasty pimp they can go whenever they want yeah you don't  like it go bye yeah they keep most of their money it's like it's a different vibe man so yeah  tomorrow we're gonna take more phone calls from the miserable fathers out there yes one lucky father  will be flown to the bunny ranch and get all that stuff jimmy was just talking about and dennis  hoff's gonna call the show tomorrow and we'll uh we're gonna hype this thing it's a love me huh  all right who doesn't love jimmy look at this cheek i know it's kissable 
[02:11:00]  what's happening jimmy is the relationship unraveling a little bit no things are good  oh no oh god no maybe we should be sending you to the bunny ranch you know jimmy do believe me i will  be out there the worst thing the worst thing about you with uh in a relationship is you don't understand  that the people around you kind of um are rooting you take a liking to to uh who you're with and then 
[02:11:30]  uh all of a sudden we have to deal with the fact that um you know there's problems and then you start  worrying whether you're going to be seeing a lot of this person anymore people around me argue with  her let them do it if they want to step in while i'm arguing i can relax and they can handle the arguing  just like tag team oh yeah a little tag off and then uh walk away and uh go to the bar i love  when you bring up a song you just got to cut all time well yeah we had a good uh relationship me and  you you're done don't talk to my friends don't call anybody my family's dead to you uh goodbye goodbye 
[02:12:00]  yeah we did get along but goodbye goodbye goodbye i don't go out with her anymore so i don't need to  see you anymore uh bear so what's the update nothing since we last talked to you  nothing no he's still in hell all right and and the wife's been cool exactly what did she what  did she think of her time on the opian anthony show oh she she thinks it's a goof but she doesn't  really i mean this is to me it's a serious issue certainly is no joke man yeah but like i said i 
[02:12:30]  don't want to be a part-time father i want to raise my kids and once they're old enough self-sufficient  then maybe i'll be gone unless things change there what's gonna happen if you do win this trip now  you know we're gonna see if there's any other fathers out there for the rest of the week here  say you win the trip and then all of a sudden she puts her uh her foot down and says no way  then what happens i don't think she will i i really don't think but if she did would you 
[02:13:00]  tell her to go screw and you would uh just go anyway oh yeah i would go yeah he's going regardless  if uh if he does win this i deserve it i work my i work my butt off bear bear bear have you given any  thought to what it'll be like seriously fantasize maybe shut your eyes that you're sitting there uh  you're you're sitting across from a beautiful beautiful girl potential yeah on on this on a date and uh  maybe you're you know you're eating dinner or or you're you're holding you know you're she's 
[02:13:30]  reached down maybe under the table to to touch your leg have you given any thought to the excitement  factor that's going to be like yeah i did about about 15 minutes ago i did oh yeah i cleaned up and went  to work oh i've been thinking about it since i talked to you guys yeah see this guy is raring to go man  it's all it's only fair but uh it's gonna be tough to beat bear as far as this contest goes  oh yeah it's possible yeah you never know we'll take your uh pathetic uh stories tomorrow
