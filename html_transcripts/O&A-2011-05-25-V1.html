<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show’s “After ONA Live” segment began with a recap of the preceding hour’s chaotic events centered around the unexpected meeting and impromptu collaboration between AC/DC’s Brian Johnson and actor Malcolm McDowell, who, surprisingly, were friends.  The unplanned interaction resulted in a frantic scramble by the staff to document the event with multiple microphones and cameras.  Both Johnson and McDowell sang together.  Adding to the chaos, McDowell readily agreed to take photos with everyone present, including Opie, Anthony, the staff, and even the PR personnel.

A substantial portion of the "After ONA Live" segment focused on Jim Norton's intense pursuit of autographs from both Johnson and McDowell.  His enthusiasm led to the introduction of a table to hold his numerous items for signing – posters and other memorabilia.  The placement and purpose of this table became a point of contention among the staff, with accusations of one staff member prioritizing his own autograph acquisition over others.  The staff also discussed Norton’s pre-, during-, and post-guest appearance behavior and reactions.  The conversation included tangential discussions about movie preferences, specifically *The Hangover 2*, and comparisons of staff members to characters from the film.  The segment concluded with ongoing discussion about the day's chaotic events, particularly the autograph acquisition frenzy, and a brief mention of the upcoming Ron and Fez show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus. Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After ONA Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  What a last hour.  Good lord, it's After Opie and Anthony Live. I'm Sam Roberts.  And if you haven't been listening, I mean you should be listening to the whole show anyway,  but if you didn't hear that last hour of radio,  I don't know where you were.  It was Brian Young, Brian Johnson from ACDC was in here. 
[00:00:30]  He did a great interview.  He was awesome to hang out with.  All of a sudden, Malcolm McDowell, who we have booked right after Brian Johnson,  they turned out to be best friends.  Roland is having a good day because all day...  Oh, I was getting shit on.  You were getting shit on.  And this was going on during commercial breaks, right?  Because Jim mentioned a little on the air that he was getting to the point 
[00:01:00]  where you guys were arguing about whether or not the curtains were going to be shut.  Jim, I mean...  Too close.  Too close for...  I just want to say pure genius.  Thank you.  Hello.  Thank you.  Who is the genius?  I just say, let people do their jobs and then things work out.  So you...  I mean...  Because, I mean, people on feedback are chiming in.  Instant classic.  What happened was, Brian Johnson from ACDC is just wrapping up and we say,  oh, we have to get to Malcolm McDowell next.  And he goes, Malcolm McDowell's here? 
[00:01:30]  Malcolm?  And he was right outside the door at the time.  They come in.  They meet each other here in the studio.  And I'm, you know, like they...  Fuck all!  Yeah!  And they were best friends!  Who would have thought that they were friends that hadn't seen each other in a while?  They embrace.  They're bullshitting.  We as, like, everybody on staff, there's like four of us just running with mics,  trying to get them in various positions because Malcolm and Brian completely forgot that they were on the air.  So it was like, I'm sitting there trying to get an angle with the video camera. 
[00:02:00]  You had Travis and Danny and Nagelmeister was trying to get photos for whatever reason.  Oh, for the PR department is requesting the photos.  That's crazy!  Yeah, because then all of a sudden, you know, Danny and Travis,  everybody's trying to throw mics in their faces because we're trying to get some of this on the air.  Or, like you said, the PR department gets wind of this,  so mystery people start coming in and just start taking pictures  because they're hugging each other.  They were singing together.  At one point, Brian Johnson from ACDC and Malcolm McDowell are singing together. 
[00:02:30]  I mean, Malcolm McDowell doesn't know what's going on  because he can't believe this is a radio show.  I mean, everything's mic'd.  It's all working.  It's all sounding good.  Jim asks for a picture with the two of them,  which, because, I mean, who could pass up that photo op?  And then...  Malcolm McDowell says, who else wants one?  Yeah, Malcolm McDowell.  Anthony comes in for one.  Obi comes in for one.  Everybody.  And Malcolm McDowell sealed his own fate when he said, who else wants one? 
[00:03:00]  You see Malcolm McDowell's manager running in, Danny running in,  E-Rock running in, Derek tried to run in.  Derek missed out.  Oh, no, Eric didn't get one.  E-Rock did not get one.  He was taking pictures.  Oh, he was taking...  Did you get one?  I never get nothing.  Why would I?  You're the booker.  Yeah, why would I do it?  You get any more of those Clockwork Orange Blu-rays?  I didn't get one.  Look, you fucked me out of a Jesse James book.  Don't fuck me out of this one.  I didn't get one.  I never got one.  Don't dick me in the ass.  You know about the dick in the ass.  You know how it feels.  Don't make me feel that. 
[00:03:30]  I never got a Clockwork Orange Blu-ray.  The one I got, the box set,  Jamie took it from me.  He stole it.  He took it from me.  So what was it like before this magic?  And I mean, I'm telling you guys,  if you didn't hear the whole last hour of the show,  the Brian Johnson and Malcolm McDowell,  it was all one segment pretty much,  the way it melded over.  We had to...  The show would have gone on.  You wouldn't have had to sit through  my nasally voice  if Malcolm McDowell hadn't had someplace to go. 
[00:04:00]  And Jim, as we speak,  is interviewing Brian Johnson, correct?  Yep.  For his Boneyard show,  Brian Johnson's sitting there waiting for Jim  because Jim is still interviewing Malcolm.  Mm-hmm.  So what was it like?  I mean, the whole thing ended up great.  The replay starts at 3 in the East,  but you know that by now.  Roland, what was it like  dealing with Norton today?  Did you...  First of all,  he's always particular about guests.  He said we should spread out the time 
[00:04:30]  not so close together.  And I said don't fucking worry.  I got this.  He's always particular about guests.  Yes.  But Travis and I were talking earlier  that neither one of us,  and I don't know if you,  had any idea,  because this was like  Aussie-level obsession.  Like on Aussie days,  everybody here knows,  you know...  I think it's almost worse than Aussie days  because Aussie days were all prepped  and prepared.  This was a sideswipe.  Like, yeah,  who knew  that he would get this obsessive...  I mean,  Brian Johnson was like, 
[00:05:00]  cool,  but Malcolm McDowell  he went nuts for.  Not to say he shouldn't,  but who knew?  He loves him.  Was it a surprise to you  or did you see this coming?  Because, like,  you're the talent booker,  so wrangling guests  is pretty much your job.  Some days,  you get the easiest job in the world.  Other days,  you have the absolute  most difficult job in the world.  Did you realize  that Norton was going to be  at this level of obsessive  Norton today? 
[00:05:30]  When I woke up  and heard the birds in the shower,  I go,  this is going to be a good day.  You didn't know.  You had no idea.  You went last night,  saw the Hangover 2  with your friends,  everybody left.  Me and you were texting each other,  figuring out who's in the wolf pack.  By the way,  I was thinking about that.  You are Galifianakis.  Who's Eric?  Eric would have to be...  Kim Jong.  Why?  Because of the little...  I fell asleep during that scene.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  Very small penis.  No, I would think 
[00:06:00]  that Eric would be Ed Helms.  I can see that.  Which would leave me as...  Bradley Cooper.  I would see that.  Hey, you're blessed.  Yeah, I can see that.  And so good looking.  Yeah, there you go.  You are the ladies' man.  Now, Roland, tell me,  at what point this morning...  What time did you get here this morning?  Probably 6.30.  Because, yeah,  you're not supposed to get here  until 8,  but you're always here  before 7.  Yeah, because he's going to play a clip  or the bet for Tom Papa.  Right.  He's coming tomorrow.  Right, which I'll play that in a second. 
[00:06:30]  I'll play the clip  that we recorded at the movie theater.  But at what point,  after you got here at 6.30,  at what point this morning  did you realize  today was not the day  that the birds  were going to be singing for you?  Well, I got tagged at 6.31.  Did you?  What did it say?  Is everything...  What show before or after Malcolm?  What's this?  What's that?  I'm like,  oh, sweet Jesus.  And then you realize  you heard Norton on the air  talking about all the  things that he had purchased. 
[00:07:00]  Tables.  Everything has to get signed.  Yeah, well...  Like a lock of hair or whatever.  The table  was Nagel's idea.  But the thing is,  where do I put this?  Where do I put this?  Oh, I got you.  And so he's going...  Eric came up with a solution  and said,  why don't we just get a table?  He goes,  I'm fine with that.  And then...  And then all of a sudden  he wasn't fine anymore.  Well, I mean...  He was excited.  You know,  he gets a little antsy at times.  Eric,  what was the deal with the table?  Because it became an issue.  What's on?  Is this on?  Yeah, they're all on.  Eric was trying to save... 
[00:07:30]  Yeah, so Norton said,  I need a place to put it.  And you were like,  here's a table.  And then he goes,  what are you bringing a table in here for?  No, what happened was,  Norton,  when he first showed us  the big art portfolio  with these two pristine posters...  Which, to give an update,  both got signed.  Yes.  And photo documented  per Jim's request.  Just like you  with your wrestling chair?  Yeah, had to do that.  Why are you making a fist  with Brian Johnson?  Because I didn't know  what he was doing.  He's a boxer.  Well, Eric doesn't know  who Brian Johnson is.  He just took the photo. 
[00:08:00]  Go ahead.  Anyway,  so Jim was moving  all this stuff that we have,  like papers,  prep sheets,  water, coffee,  to try to fit this huge thing  on the console here.  But you can see  where the mics are.  There wasn't enough room.  It's literally,  it's an art portfolio.  It was probably  three feet across  by maybe two feet tall.  You think he went to FIT?  Yes.  Yeah, so  my solution was,  remember how,  like at XM,  like at the K-Rock studio,  we had a big table  where when we were done,  we'd put everything  on the table  so that the guests 
[00:08:30]  would be in studio,  could sign everything  and then leave.  Yeah.  So I'm like,  I'll go and I'll find a table.  I asked Jim,  should I get a table  that will help you out?  He thought it was a good idea.  He did?  Yeah.  Okay, because that wasn't  what we heard on the air.  No, because here's what,  I'll tell you why  he did what he did.  So I got the table,  I explained to him  what I was going to do,  I set up the table,  you know,  and then we had to figure out  where out here  the table was going to go  so the publicist could stand  and what have you.  Yeah.  Jim thought,  because we don't have  the space here,  we used to bring a table  out at 57th Street  and at K-Rock 
[00:09:00]  because we had  these massive studios  and basically  an entire floor  to ourselves.  so there was always  like a corner  or someplace  where we could put the table,  it was out of notice,  it wasn't here,  we have a small studio  and I mean a hallway  that's shared,  we can't put the table  in the hallway  because it's blocking  people walking.  As I was trying to explain  to Jim earlier,  but you know,  he was tunnel vision on this,  Yeah.  I could either put the table,  I'll move this furniture  out over here behind me  and put the table there  or I could put it  right outside  and it was just 
[00:09:30]  going to be the table.  Jim thought  we were going to decorate it  with merchandise  that everybody was going  to get a million things signed.  That wasn't the case.  It was supposed to be  the tables here  so that when he's done  and we have a tendency  to run late with guests,  he could throw his portfolio  on the table  and it's set there right away  and he could have  everything signed  for him.  That's what it was for.  Jim asserted.  He said he loves you.  Yeah.  He's not trying to take shots  at you.  Yeah.  But he said  we all know  that E-Rock did not 
[00:10:00]  set that table up  just for me.  That is total bullshit.  I talked to everybody  here about  facilities about  getting a table  was to prevent  a meltdown  that he couldn't  get his posters  on the console.  All Eric Wan's sign  was ACDC for his wife.  That was it.  Yeah.  You didn't have  clockwork stuff?  No.  I did but  I didn't want to push it.  What about the  Star Trek DVD?  I know you were very  excited about Star Trek.  Yeah but I didn't  want to push that either.  I knew what the  situation was  so I was not  going to push it.  Because you're the  autograph king around here. 
[00:10:30]  You won't deny that.  No I'm not.  I'm the prince.  Well I mean  aside from  from the host  you know Jim is  obviously the  autograph king.  Yes.  But host aside  you are the  autograph king.  It depends.  It depends on what  it is.  The whore.  I can't be good  ow.  The autograph  whore.  You do get a lot  of signatures.  You get more  autographs than  anybody else.  Well it depends.  Some stuff hangs up  in the office.  Like with the  wrestlers yes  because a lot of  that goes to my  nephew.  I get one for me  and the rest of it  goes to my nephew.  Your nephews have 
[00:11:00]  better autograph  collections than  most sports  memorabilia collectors  at this point.  That's what you  should do with  this position.  If you can't  spoil your nieces  and nephews  why not?  I guess so.  I'd never do  with my nieces and nephews.  You don't have any.  Are you going to get  the thing signed  for our friend  up in Connecticut?  I got that signed.  Yeah that's already  done.  So yeah.  Joe in Connecticut.  Don't worry about  what he does in  Connecticut.  And guess what?  WWE?  I don't know. 
[00:11:30]  Don't.  It went unsaid.  People know what's  in Connecticut.  Why?  And it's associated  with me and E-Rock.  And Randy and  Marchman Savage.  But let's just say  a poll.  Are you putting  like when you package  the DVD that you're  sending in Connecticut?  Yes.  Will there be room  for like a resume  or something?  Well one it's a Blu-ray.  And two no  because they think  you're a bully.  Don't tell them.  Why do they think  I'm a bully?  They told me that.  Well I don't know.  And they're part of  that organization  that prevents  bullies.  Enjoy the Blu-ray Joe. 
[00:12:00]  So you didn't get  anything for yourself?  From Malcolm?  No.  Because I got one  for my brother.  That was it.  And you barely ever  get anything.  Plus  Roland?  Mm-hmm.  You booked him.  So you know  because I was  sitting here this  morning when I got  here I was like  ah because I got  a picture with  Malcolm McDowell  at a comic  convention or  horror convention.  It was a chiller  theater wasn't it?  No.  Who cares?  Monster Mania  maybe.  It was one of the  ones but it's a  great picture. 
[00:12:30]  And I had it  printed like last  week to make sure  I had it you know.  And I got here  and I realized I  had forgotten it at  home.  And I was like  oh I can't  believe I forgot  it.  Once the show  started and Jim  started talking about  what he was doing  and the vibe started  getting made clear  around here I was  like thank God I  don't have that  picture.  Which led to Jim  thinking that the  table was for all  of us to put a  million things out  for Malcolm to  sign when it was  to try to prevent  a meltdown. 
[00:13:00]  What are we  waiting for?  I'm waiting on Jim.  Okay because I just  saw Jim Brewer out  there.  Are you supposed to  take a picture or  something?  Well that and a  few other things.  He still has more  stuff for Malcolm to  sign.  What?  So I have to  handle that.  No.  You should bring  him in here to  sign it.  But they'll hit you  liners though.  Yeah well I'll see  what I can do.  Unless you want to  do like run the  fez desk to  hours of liners.  So anyway in  short the table was  to help Jim out.  I'm sorry.  That's all it was.  And then Jim turned  it into even worse  than what the  original intention was  supposed to be.  Yeah because Jim  definitely said that 
[00:13:30]  that table was you  you would have put  his stuff on there  but you would like  to put a little  something for the  nagle man on there.  A little treat for  yourself.  That's what Jim said.  Jim had like nine  things.  Well.  That table would have  taken care of all of  that.  You're saying the  table wouldn't have  been able to withstand  the weight of more  things.  No no no I'm not  saying that at all.  That one thing that  Jim wanted to sign  that he didn't sign  he went please and  Michael goes I'll sign  that later.  He goes okay.  Yeah Jim got a  little he was a 
[00:14:00]  little hurt but he  did a I don't know  if it was his  little fuck like  that.  He did because he  didn't get some of  the other things  signed yet.  This brings up a  good thing.  You guys got to go?  I don't know.  Oh yeah he's  wrapping up.  What's going on?  He's wrapping up  right now Jim.  Yeah.  Alright you go take  care of that.  I got another minute.  Is he taking care of  Brian Johnson?  Yeah.  Oh okay.  Jim should come  back in here if he's  walking by.  When you have to  deal how would you  say Norton is 
[00:14:30]  like because he is  still you still  had to interview  Brian Johnson  after today's show  but the big thing  that he was nervous  about was how  Brian Johnson and  Malcolm McDowell were  going to do on O&A  with him here and  everything.  Yeah.  What's his vibe like  immediately after it  happens?  After both guests?  Like because of all  this hype and he's  been nervous and  everything once it's  over and it was  successful what's his  vibe like?  What's Jim Brewer  doing out there?  He's dancing crazy. 
[00:15:00]  He's rocking out.  Jim Brewer's playing  air guitar outside  the studio.  The vibe was  it went well.  Here it is.  Jim was like this  was amazing.  Brian Johnson was  great.  Brian and Malcolm  together was amazing.  Malcolm was great.  Got some of his  stuff signed.  Annoyed that the  rest of it wasn't  signed.  He still has that  because he had to  go interview Brian  Johnson again which  was fine.  He wants to do  that for his  Boneyard show.  Boneyard yeah.  But now we're  trying to coordinate  so when Norton  is done and 
[00:15:30]  there goes Brian  Johnson.  Brian Johnson,  Jim Brewer.  When Norton's done  with that.  What's Travis going  with them for?  To coordinate when  Malcolm's done doing  this other interview  and then he has one  more interview right  next door.  With who?  I'm guessing Al  Q.  Oh Malcolm.  Malcolm.  So I got to have  all this stuff ready  so Jim can coordinate  the time to get  Malcolm out of the  second interview after  we've been done.  Do you think?  I can't even  explain this right.  It's hurting my  head.  Roland's explaining 
[00:16:00]  all of this to Jim  right now.  What's up D-boy?  What does?  Mic technique.  Mic technique?  He didn't like the  other mic on right  next to me.  Oh oh.  Okay.  He's a maniac.  Pop out so when  he comes out of the  bathroom I get a  picture with him.  Okay.  Who?  Alright.  Malcolm?  Yeah.  And Travis?  I already have a  picture.  I'm asking for the  audience not for me  Roland.  I have no idea.  Do you think the 
[00:16:30]  whole time Jim was  interviewing Brian  Johnson he was  sitting there thinking  about getting stuff  signed?  At the very beginning  yes.  Then when it started  getting deep into the  conversation when  they're talking about  the race cars and  Jim's talking about  the book getting  blown and different  cars up until about  five minutes before.  Malcolm a thousand  out of stuff.  How did I?  Stretch.  Stretch.  Stretch what?  Everybody's in here.  I don't have to  stretch anything.  He's looking for  his stuff.  Yeah you grab that 
[00:17:00]  one and then leave  that on them.  You gave it to  Roland?  So one of you guys  brought it to  me.  You didn't give  that to me.  Hang on.  Roland had to have  taken him.  Nobody would have  taken anything off  that chair.  Oh boy.  Eric's running.  Did you lose some  of your stuff?  What?  Did you lose some  of your stuff?  No.  I just want to get  I didn't take a  picture of Malcolm  but I knew he'd  have time after.  Yeah.  I think he's doing  out cue they said  right now.  Is that what he's  doing right now?  I believe he is.  He's doing the  liners as I left it  there so we can sign 
[00:17:30]  out the liners.  Oh in Derek's  studio.  Oh okay.  I just want to  sign one to  Otto because I  promise Malcolm's  done.  Yeah it's fine.  Do you know anything  It's still stressful in  here Troy.  It's been absolute  insanity.  You were with Jim  when he was  recording Brian  Johnson?  Brian Johnson  over in the other  studio.  For the Boneyard  show.  Yeah Brian Johnson  was waiting for him  to come out of the  studio and now  Brewers is going in  it's just it's been  How is the Brian  Johnson interview?  Oh it's great.  It's going to air on  Travis.  What in God's name  is going on in the  hallways?  I see you running 
[00:18:00]  around in the  hallways.  What is happening?  Well Roland you know  I want a picture of  Brian Johnson.  He's a legend.  Gotcha.  So Roland's like  yeah he's going to  go to the bathroom  and then Brewer's  going to interview him  but you should get a  picture like right  before Brewer  interviews.  I'm like you know  I trust Roland.  Roland always gets it  done.  He delivers.  So I'm just going  with the flow.  And Eric what are you  doing running around?  I'll tell you in a  minute.  Oh God he's  exhausted.  I bet it has  something to do with  an autograph.  I can't believe I  thought that like the  vibe would be calm 
[00:18:30]  now and like everybody  would be cool because  the segment went well.  Yeah.  It's chaos still.  And it's chaos even  after it's been  assured to us that  Malcolm has plenty of  time afterwards to  take care of anything  Jim needs.  He will.  Did we find it?  What's Brian doing  right now?  I think Brian is  doing Jim Brewer.  What's Malcolm  doing?  Malcolm is he's  doing Al Q right?  Yeah Malcolm's doing  Al Q.  Did I get it signed  or no?  What is it? 
[00:19:00]  No it's been  driving you nuts.  Don't get it signed.  I don't know if I  should get.  Yeah I'll get the  program signed.  You know what's the  weird thing?  You can always get a  new one.  No you can't.  That's the thing.  There are certain  things that like are  more valuable not  signed.  I don't care about  the value.  Like monetary value.  It's not a money  thing.  I'm never selling  to this shit.  Well as many  Malcolm McDonald's  signatures as you  have.  Right.  Would it mean more  to just have that?  Like do you need the  signature on it?  Will it add anything  to it?  Right.  Probably not. 
[00:19:30]  Because you have him  like the cool thing  that you got when he  signed that poster the  skinny one that you  were talking about.  He said he had never  even seen it.  He'd never seen it.  But that's cool to get  signed.  Yeah.  And you got him to  sign that and the  Japanese poster.  You might leave that  unsigned just to have  it.  Yeah I do kind of like  this like this.  It's so cool man.  What is it?  Is it a movie program?  Yeah they used to  hand these out in the  theater.  I've never seen it.  Oh it's too hard to 
[00:20:00]  get out.  Yeah you don't want to  damage it.  What's he doing?  They're going to bring  both guys by to that  table so you get your  stuff signed.  I don't need Brian to  come by.  I feel bad.  I don't want to be.  We got kind of rushed.  I'm obsessed today.  I know we were  talking.  That's all we've been  talking about.  But the interviews  weren't good right?  The segments were  incredible.  Like the whole segment  and the crossover was  amazing.  I had a feeling they  know each other.  They're both too famous  not to have known each  other or at least be  aware of each other.  Yeah.  And Brian for the  Boneyard show is going  to be great.  It's going to air this  Friday. 
[00:20:30]  Oh yeah.  He was good right?  He was awesome.  He was great.  Jim we were all  talking about that  like when it's an  Aussie day there's  Brewer and Brian  Johnson right now.  Let them go.  They're going to do  an interview.  No no no.  Jim.  Eric.  Eric.  No.  He's letting him go.  Yeah no.  Don't interrupt him.  We were all saying  that when it's an  Aussie day here we  know like if there's  an Osborne coming in  we know okay you  know this is an  obsessive day for Jim  obviously you know  and as it should be.  None of us had any  idea that like you 
[00:21:00]  were going to react  to Malcolm McDowell  this much like we  didn't know you were  this obsessed with  Clockwork and Malcolm.  It's like Clockwork  is one of my favorite  movies of all time  if not my favorite  I've said that for so  many years.  Yeah.  And Malcolm's  character is you know  come on it's he's  Alexander DeLarge.  I'll probably never  have the chance again.  It's like when do you  have the chance to  hang out with a guy  or talk to a guy that  you love so much.  I was thinking that  while you were talking  to him because you  you did a lot of  the interview and you 
[00:21:30]  did a great job but  I mean I didn't mean  to hog the mic to  you weren't okay I  didn't mean to do  that it was not  intentional.  I think Opie and  Anthony realized that  you know you being  like everybody's a  fan of that movie but  you in the room were  the super fan plus you  were the one who  would watch the DVD  and everything.  Yeah.  Was it do you like  because you say when  you get pictures that  you don't like to stop  and talk to him like  you like to take the  picture and go do you  like doing interviews  like that though?  Yeah when I'm  talking to somebody I'm  very comfortable like  I just did Brian  Johnson on the 
[00:22:00]  Boneyard for Friday  and I was very  comfortable talking to  him one on one.  I'm almost more  comfortable in a room  alone with him because  I have to listen.  Yeah.  I don't know why I'm  answering it like you  just said Jim explain  your amazing interview  techniques.  I'm just a fucking  faggot fanboy.  Thank you for singing.  I'm acting like I'm  way more than I am but  it's fucking Malcolm  McDowell dude and he was  a nice guy and you  know look he got to  hang out with Brian  Johnson by coming on  the show and I know  I'm going to plug the  DVDs properly like I'm  going to do them  justice and plug what  he likes and happily 
[00:22:30]  plug it.  So I feel like we give  something too.  It was pretty funny when  after Brian Johnson  left he goes okay so  am I done?  Is that the interview?  Can I go?  Who Brian?  No Malcolm.  Yeah yeah yeah.  He thought he was  finished.  No you haven't even  started.  He smelled really good  too.  Malcolm did?  Yeah he smelled like  really rich English.  British guys always  smell good.  Let me always smell  not like fucking  Halford smelled great.  Let me didn't smell  bad but he smelled  like fucking booze.  God damn it.  Oh Roland's the one  person that gets Jim  every time because he's  so nervous about the 
[00:23:00]  celebrities that Roland  just takes advantage.  Do I want to get this  signed or no?  Yes.  Because if you don't  get it signed then you  go why did I get it  signed?  Will you do that?  Yeah I will.  You will?  Okay.  Well then Roland's right.  Have you met him  outside of conventions  before?  No I only met Malcolm  once thanks to Big  Kev.  Yeah.  I got a picture with  him and again oh fuck  I forgot to ask him  about Caligula.  Fuck.  Let's get him back in  here.  I don't think he'll  do the after shit show  I don't know why  because he's got  five minutes do I  want to take a picture  or have him do this  fucking no listener  show? 
[00:23:30]  There's listeners.  It was fucking great  him and Brian Johnson  being in here and you  got most of that on  tape.  Where's my fucking  little video camera?  I wrapped it in.  Oh thank you Irock.  I fucking I'm really  out of sorts today  because I knew this  would be a big day.  Were you worried that  Malcolm would be like  not cool?  You knew he would.  No I knew it'd be  cool but I hope the  signature I have it I  have fucking cardboard  under it and I hope the  signature's not like  crooked.  It's okay I think.  There's a cardboard  in there.  Oh fuck dude I hope  not.  Smear.  Cocksucker.  I was watching old  interviews with him 
[00:24:00]  like.  Because Malcolm didn't  want.  Sorry to interrupt you.  No you go ahead.  He didn't want me to  fucking smear it either.  He's like make sure  it's not smeared.  You go no no no the  cardboard's fine.  I hope it did get  smeared.  Remember our second  day is going to be  June 7th.  What do you mean?  Bernard Hopkins and  Sugar Ray.  No no no June 7th  is fucking Brock and  Sugar Ray Leonard.  Wow.  Well at least you  Vincent D'Onofria.  Yeah he may be the next  state to spread it  out.  At least you've  already met Brock  though so you won't  be so.  Are they smeared?  No.  Wait.  He's checking his  art portfolio now. 
[00:24:30]  Sucker can someone  help me?  He does look like he  goes to Tisch at NYU.  What did you say  Eric?  No it's FIT final.  Yeah.  I said this is why  he needed the table.  Yeah.  What do you want us  to say you were  right about the table?  Yes.  Eric Eric took  umbrage by the way  that you thought that  he was getting the  table not just for  your stuff but for  his stuff too.  Looks a bit smeared  from this side.  No it doesn't.  I can't see it.  That looks good right?  Does that look like  it's signed poorly?  It looks pretty good  and he wrote  video well on it.  Yeah.  You gotta like that.  The only thing is it's  right by the end of the 
[00:25:00]  fucking thing.  That's what he says  clockwork.  The frame's gonna cut it  off.  A little bit yeah.  Fuck.  I haven't re-signed it  over there.  Yeah I got this  clockwork orange poster  super rare and  signed by Malcolm  McDowell twice.  No but it's right by  the end so actually  the uh  is shit.  The piece is gonna  go over it by like  Yeah you get it mounted  so it's in the center  and then you have a  extension piece.  I'll never mount it.  You know it's great though  because there's two L's  in his name so at least  the first L will be  there so you'll see  who it is. 
[00:25:30]  No no no.  Just the second L  will get cut off.  You're gonna miss that  much.  That's it.  Get it matted.  You don't.  Eric.  Hey.  Get it matted.  Cut off the signature.  We're just trying to  help you Jim.  Trying to help you  with the assignment.  I know he's signed  right by the end on  both of these.  Just get it matted.  Just cut it.  You have a small mat.  Cut it with his  scissors.  You know.  Get it matted.  And that way there's  a little bit of a  border and then the  frame line.  This is great.  Or get some nail polish.  Get some nail polish.  Yeah he's signed  too close to the edge  but I can't pitch.  Well because you  didn't pull the posters  out all the way  because you were  in a rush. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah but I also  didn't want to  damage the posters  because if I pulled  them out all the way  and they got fucked up  I would have all  How great would  that have been  if Opie and me  were both filming you  and you pull out  your poster and it  tears.  You just hear a  Would you have  been upset?  Yeah.  I don't think that  would have been  great at all actually.  No?  No.  Do you want the truth?  I'll figure out a way.  Alright.  We're good.  So you're going to  get Otto's thing signed  and you are going to  get the program signed?  Yes.  Okay.  Yeah I might as well.  I was saying before 
[00:26:30]  when you were over  Eric took umbrage  that you thought  that he was putting  the table out  not just for you  but also so he could  put his little treats  on there too.  Well you know  I love Iraq but  Must be honest  what was he doing  that for?  Who did I learn it  from I guess?  Exactly.  Who?  Jim?  Yeah.  Oh.  But now that Jim's  in here you're not  saying that Jim was  wrong.  I said it to him  already.  The table was just  there for him.  I don't believe that  either.  Troy do you believe it?  No comment.  No for a second.  I got to piss.  I'll be right back.  Okay. 
[00:27:00]  Troy when uh  when Jim was doing  his interview.  There should be no  beverages on that table.  That was Brewers.  Well somebody  why isn't anybody  watching the table?  I know.  Eric.  Yeah it's his idea  go watch the table Eric.  All of a sudden  it's a garbage heap.  Yeah.  When Jim was doing  the interview with  Brian Johnson  did it seem like  when am I going to  get signed by  Malcolm McDowell  was on his mind?  No Jim's amazing  like that.  He can pull it  together so quick  and get in the zone 
[00:27:30]  and handle his shit.  He was together.  Yeah.  Wow.  Did he pass gas  Eric?  Oh yeah.  Is that what you're  smelling?  It's very sour  gumming from the  hallway into the  gumming from the  hallway.  Sorry I was drinking.  Coming from the  hallway into the  studio.  Everybody's  He's nervous.  Freaked out.  Roland's running  all over the place.  Spencer and Laura  have been pacing  back and forth.  Who knew?  Jim can send  everybody into a  tizzy.  That's what it is  because he gets  everybody involved.  He panics.  He panics and then  everybody else panics.  He just starts 
[00:28:00]  sending emails to  everybody.  Like if he just  stayed calm  everything would be  calm and full of  food.  But if he stayed  calm what if it  didn't get done?  Well I guess he  just has to put the  fear into everybody  to make sure this  happens.  I'll tell you this  much.  When Jim wants to  get something done  it tends to get  completed does it  not?  It does.  I mean no matter  what office and if  it's not getting  completed around here  he will walk down  that hallway and  go to keep going  all right I'll go  above you I'll go  above you until he's  upstairs.  He's not afraid to  go into every single  office until whatever 
[00:28:30]  he needs done gets  done.  I mean even Steve  Leeds was running  around here.  What's Steve Leeds  doing?  Steve Leeds was  checking on Brian  Johnson.  My God.  Remember poor Steve  Leeds with the J-Lo  picture for J-Lo.  Oh God how could I  forget?  That's when we got a  replay when Steve  Leeds was going  chasing J-Lo around  and Jim couldn't  focus on the show  because he kept  paying attention to  what Steve Leeds  was doing.  Patrice kept telling  him that oh you're  missing her you're  missing her and he  kept turning around.  Oh my God. 
[00:29:00]  Is the autograph  table out there  intact?  Yes it's all intact.  It's ready.  Jim's reorganizing  it from how it  was organized.  So are you trying  to get your Star  Trek sign?  Now I will.  Oh look at Eric  who puts his stuff  down on the gym  table.  Well now that he's  coming back I wasn't  before.  I was thinking when  you were on the air  today and they were  playing Best of E-Rock  clips.  Yeah that was awesome.  And you kind of went  in there and you said  yeah I might not do  this physical fitness  thing.  Yeah.  Normally like three 
[00:29:30]  weeks ago they would  have said fuck you  fatty you're doing it.  But today Opie's  going well I hope  Eric does it.  Like and Ant's like  come on will you  please?  Like it seems like  you kind of put the  fear of God in him  last week.  I mean am I wrong?  No absolutely.  Didn't it like that  segment like I'm  sitting there trying  to hype it up but Opie  and Anthony are going  I hope Eric does it.  It's up to him I guess.  And I go what?  When did this happen?  Well I can't speak for  Opie but just from what  he was saying today about 
[00:30:00]  the hockey poster he's I  think there's some guilt  there that he did what  he did with it.  And again I can't speak  for him but just kind of  what he said on the air  today.  By the way in terms of  the Hangover 2 movie  Eric I didn't go with  Opie.  Stanley T invited me to  go with the mashups  and then Opie.  I knew that.  Don't get jealous.  Stanley T told me  yesterday.  Don't get jealous that  me and Opie were  hanging out again.  I'm not.  What are you writing  down?  Something to Travis.  Just tell me.  I'm just going to  tell him to blow out  the promos.  Just blow out the  promos.  We have all these 
[00:30:30]  breaks left.  The promos and  profit?  That's the beauty of  that.  Why would he be  wearing headphones?  He wants to know  you're talking about  the promos and  profit?  The channel promos  and profit.  Yeah you can blow  those out.  We just got to do  the commercials.  Just kill all the  commercials.  No don't kill the  commercials.  Just delete  commercials.  No that causes a  huge ordeal.  Why?  Because they're  paid for.  Yeah but who  cares?  You can't just  say hey we're not  going to play these.  Yeah.  We can.  I mean we can.  So get rid of the  Joe Rogan experience  promo.  You don't want to  plug that Eric?  We played it once 
[00:31:00]  already during the show.  Eric Nagel doesn't  want to plug the  Joe Rogan.  No that's not true.  I'm with you Eric.  Let's not plug that  bullshit.  We have three  breaks left.  Three?  Yeah.  No we don't.  We have two.  Wait why would we  have two?  52 is our out.  Oh you were going  like this.  He's saying three  minutes.  Even I picked up on  that and I didn't  even see the exchange.  I thought he was  doing that meaning  three breaks.  It was 49 and he  put up three fingers.  52.  Yeah.  And I was  mouthing how many  breaks and he went  like that.  And then I said  that I did two and  then the break sign.  Travis I would  like to think that 
[00:31:30]  if we had three  breaks you would  have told me before  now.  Absolutely.  Three breaks is an  oddity.  See Travis handles  his shit in there.  As opposed to  what?  Travis handles his  shit in there.  Wow.  Let's see you do  it.  Hey.  Roland.  Go ahead.  Roland update.  Troy Kwan's going  to be DJ in  Philadelphia.  Check that out.  No.  No?  Bethlehem this  Friday at the  Tally Hill.  Thank you Roland.  Who goes to Bethlehem  to party?  Nobody.  There's a lot of  it's great.  Great spot.  Yeah the Amish.  Bethlehem's a cool 
[00:32:00]  spot.  It's by Lehigh  University.  Yes it is.  How do you know  you've never been  there?  I've been to  I toured Lehigh.  Oh the puppies  in the house  go woo woo.  And I decided not  to go to college  there.  Bethlehem,  Pennsylvania.  Tally Ho this  Friday.  It's whack as  shit.  Yeah.  Troy's going to  bring the flavor  though.  I'm going to be  there.  You are?  Yes.  On Saturday.  Friday night.  Friday night.  I'm going to be  there.  By the way special  delivery is changing  its time on  Saturday.  8pm to 10pm  Eastern.  I just heard  probably be here  with me. 
[00:32:30]  You did lose  an hour though.  I did.  So you need to  tell Dave about  the meeting  about accident.  Oh I'm sorry.  Oh I'm sorry.  Again I don't  quite know what  you're talking  about but who's  at the door?  Norton.  Oh.  Norton we're  wrapping up.  Is there anything  you want to say?  About what?  I mean.  It's the end of  the show.  Cool.  Does it look like  the Malcolm  McDowell thing is  going to happen?  Where is he?  Did he leave him?  He's in the  Al-Q studio.  What's he still  doing in Al-Q?  He's there  until 11. 
[00:33:00]  11?  He's in the  Al-Q.  And then  I want to get  something signed  for Otto  because I told  him I would.  I want to get  I didn't take  a picture with him.  This is a cool  video.  You had the  photos of me  and Brian  and that was  cool right?  Yeah it was  really cool.  I had to do  that.  By the way  Piggy did put  his DVDs on  your table out  there.  Not earlier.  Jim predicted  it.  It came true.  Look we got  to go.  Ron and Fez  are coming.  Didn't Ron  also just tape  an interview  with Malcolm  McDowell?  Did he?  Yes he did.  That's awesome.  Oh Ronnie.  That should be  good. 
[00:33:30]  Not as good  as us because  we had  what's his name  from ACDC  but Brian Johnson.  I got a million  things going on  in my head right  now.  I'm trying to  steer this  sinking ship.  I didn't mean  to make it all  about me today.  I apologize.  No.  But I mean  it wasn't  intentional.  I'm the  fucking lunatic  with this stuff.  Opie and Anthony  didn't even watch  the Blu-ray.  But I mean  with the pictures  and stuff.  It's not that I  think I'm more  important than  anybody else.  I really don't.  I just freak out.  The pictures thing  turned into like  a funny thing.  I just freak out  man.  And it's fun 
[00:34:00]  for us to comment  on.  We did the whole  hour of this  after show  talking about you  being obsessive  and freaking out.  He's just the boy.  Don't listen to the  replay.  I don't want you  to get offended.  Ron and Fez are  coming up next.  Opie and Anthony  and after Opie and  Anthony Live  continue tomorrow.  Wow.  And that's when  we'll find out  if Jim was successful  getting the rest  of his stuff signed.  I only have  I only want one  more thing.  I'm not going  to get a whole  bunch of stuff.  We'll see you  tomorrow.  Ron and Fez  are next.  The Opie and  Anthony show  is now over.
