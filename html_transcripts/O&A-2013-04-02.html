<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often transitioning abruptly between them.  The show began with a discussion about April Fool's Day pranks, focusing on the successes and failures of various pranks, including their own poorly-received SiriusXM “Mime Radio” prank (which garnered only 11 retweets despite heavy promotion), a White House prank featuring a "Kid President," and a Florida radio station prank about contaminated water that resulted in the DJs' suspension.  The hosts, Opie and Anthony, along with Jim Norton and studio guest Denny Falcone (a radio expert), analyzed these pranks, focusing on factors like commitment and potential for harm. The discussion frequently devolved into sexually explicit and offensive territory, including graphic descriptions of personal experiences and detailed analysis of offensive comments on social media.  A caller, Oscar, recounted a clever prank by Ron and Fez.  The segment also touched upon the New York Yankees opening day game and other tangents. Falcone offered his perspective on creating successful and safe radio pranks.

The conversation then shifted to a discussion about the qualities of good and bad radio hosts, sparked by criticism of Ryan Seacrest.  The hosts debated whether hosting ability is a talent, citing various examples, both positive (Seacrest, grudgingly) and negative (Khloe Kardashian, Billy Bush).  They also discussed the changing landscape of radio and decreased opportunities for DJs.  This segued back into a discussion of their own "Mime Radio" prank and its failure to gain traction.  They also monitored a poll on rival station Gator Country regarding its return to air after a controversial stunt, noting manipulation attempts and commenting on the perceived stupidity of listeners.  Falcone, still in studio, participated in discussions about radio stunts, firings, and memorabilia collecting.  Other discussions included Lindsay Lohan's April Fool's Day prank announcement, critiques of historical inaccuracies in recent biopics, and a detailed analysis of a video showing President Obama's poor basketball skills.  A planned segment called "Rock in Reverse" featuring Dennis playing songs backward was teased.

A significant portion of the broadcast focused on President Obama's basketball skills (or lack thereof), leading to a wager that the hosts could outperform him.  The conversation then transitioned to professional bowling, with detailed, vulgar analysis of bowler Jason Belm's unusual technique.  This was followed by a humorous segment showing a viral video of a purse snatcher getting knocked unconscious after running into a window.  The show also included a discussion about radio jingles, prompted by a jingle package for a Denver radio station.  The hosts debated jingle quality, reminisced about past experiences, and proposed a listener jingle contest with humorous prizes like a used megaphone.  The segment concluded with a discussion of Ron Palillo's death, a listener's tweet, Jim Norton's review of "Taken 2," and anecdotes about Susan Olsen (Cindy Brady) and Opie's experience meeting her.

The next segment began with a humorous critique of a family's poorly executed dance routine, leading to discussions about sports commentator Michelle Beadle and a *Real Sports* preview featuring a transgender woman playing college basketball.  The hosts' commentary was heavily laced with sexually charged and offensive language.  The conversation then turned to Cardinal Dolan's views on homosexuality, leading to a heated debate with a caller, Larry from Texas, about biblical interpretations of homosexuality and morality.  This was followed by a humorous discussion of eleven things the Bible prohibits that many people disregard.  The segment ended with discussions of Opie's dissatisfaction with a promotional video, workplace conflicts, Opie's upcoming appearance on *Red Eye*, and an anecdote about his college receiving an award for having him as a graduate.

The show’s final segment began with a highly sexually explicit segment involving the hosts and staff. The discussion shifted to advertising and sponsorships, referencing past incidents including a “Trojan Man” advertisement that led to a staff member's firing.  The hosts discussed Amtrak food costs and presented poll results showing a strong preference for the show to continue indefinitely.  Jim Norton's upcoming show was promoted.  The latter half featured WWE voice Michael Cole as a guest.  They discussed his travel schedule, his wife's reaction to his work, and the Wrestlemania 27 match against Jerry Lawler, including detailed descriptions of his outfit and the on-air heart attack suffered by Lawler.  Cole shared anecdotes about his career, including experiences with other WWE personalities and a memorable YouTube clip.  He discussed WWE's changing business model, current wrestlers, and his personal history with the company.  Finally, Cole discussed his early career in journalism and his transition to WWE.

[00:00:00]  To be continued... 
[00:00:30]  Thank you. 
[00:01:00]  Thank you. 
[00:01:30]  Thank you. 
[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  Oh, this is perfect. This is how it should be.  Anthony Cumia, an alcoholic.  Hey, hi.  And Jim Norton, a comedian.  It's me! I work here!  Glad I got that one out.  Are we on live now? Is it happening?  This is it?  The three men make up the Opie and Anthony show, a popular radio program known for its cringe style of entertainment and having very few limits.  I like where this is going. I'm seeing a lot of options here.  This is, like, this is different than any other radio.  I'm telling you what we're going to hear in here today.  Tits, ass, tons of cuss words.  It's just not like radio. It's just like hanging out. 
[00:04:00]  In the past, they have been accused of multiple FCC violations and have even gotten their show suspended from satellite radio.  This is why. This is American freedom of speech.  It's good on every level.  And saying.  Every second is funny.  Wildly funny.  And philosophically spotless.  Everything you are about to hear is real.  Real people. Real excitement.  This is the Opie and Anthony show.  Oh, my God. 
[00:04:30]  Sounds really fucking douchey.  I think we got to see that right away.  Yes.  Morning, everyone.  Yay.  It's the day after April Fools.  Ah, so we don't have to deal with any more April Fools.  No.  We did ours.  So we kind of sit.  We sit it out these days.  We sit it out as one of those pros.  Like the fucking, like the old-timers game.  Right.  Or old-timers day.  We just wave from the stands.  We wave to the April Fools. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  Newbies.  The new kids that are tearing it all up with their wacky April Fools jokes.  I think Boston Magazine.  Yeah.  For the 15th year in a row.  Yeah.  Mentioned our little prank up there in Boston.  I did see that.  Whoop-a-dee-doo.  Did they add anything new?  I didn't even read the article.  I'm like, oh, what it is again.  Okay.  Yeah.  And back in 19...  A prank that'll live in infamy.  Oh, great. 
[00:05:30]  So...  But there's a couple of douchey April Fools pranks.  Yeah, there's some douchey April Fools pranks.  And then, allegedly, some trouble.  Somebody got in trouble, I guess.  I don't know.  Oh, yeah.  And didn't SiriusXM do an April Fools prank?  Or was that a listener fucking with me?  I'm not sure.  Mime radio?  Would they hire good customer service people?  God, do you hear from those people every day?  Do they read the same shit we read? 
[00:06:00]  It doesn't matter.  They don't care.  Every day, I get complaints about the customer service.  We get people that are dropping the service every day and apologizing.  Like, I really want to listen to you guys, but they're charging my credit card five different  ways, and I can't handle this shit anymore.  Or, I've been on the phone with them for four hours.  Jesus.  The online listening.  I mean, do they read the same shit we do?  Apparently not.  Mime radio.  Was that someone just fucking with us?  Or was that a SiriusXM attempt at being funny? 
[00:06:30]  It appears to be an attempt by SiriusXM.  No, no, no.  Get the fuck out of here.  How do you know?  This is what they find funny?  So what?  They had a new channel, and they said it's going to be mime radio?  Get it?  Oh, my God.  Get it?  See, because they don't talk.  They're mimes.  You're kidding.  You're kidding.  Channel zero, of course.  Oh, channel zero.  Hey, how do you know it isn't just the listener that made that little sign? 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, how do we know for sure?  I mean, it's on the satellite radio fan board.  I mean, I guess it could be, but they're not.  Maybe a fan made that.  I pray our company didn't push that forward as something that might be funny.  Yeah.  I pray.  You don't think that's funny?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, I mean, it's looking like it's a SiriusXM.  Oh, my God.  What would they call you?  Mime radio.  Mime.  Mime radio. 
[00:07:30]  That's a good one.  That's pretty douchey.  I get it.  I get it.  You get it, Jim?  Yeah, I enjoy it.  It's weird, though.  Oh, boy.  That's terrific.  It's weird that a prank like that didn't get everybody talking more, though.  That we're not still, on April 2nd, not sure whether SiriusXM pulled it off or not.  Yeah, yeah.  Did anyone around here pull off an April Fool's prank that was kind of clever?  No, I mean.  I've heard of some douchey ones that some of the other channels did, but has anyone come  up with something that was clever? 
[00:08:00]  I didn't hear anything good.  Like, did the morning mashup do anything?  No.  They laughed at Rich because Rich read something that was an April Fool's Day prank, and he  got gotten.  What did I'm seeing?  Ron and Fez, Ronnie B.  What did Ronnie B do?  Supposedly, they did something.  I just checked my Twitter this morning.  They said it was pretty clever.  What?  With Black Earl and Eastside Dave.  I don't know what they did, though.  Does anyone?  I wasn't listening to the channel yesterday. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah, I don't know.  I know they were in Best of yesterday.  How do we not know?  So maybe they...  They were in Best of yesterday?  Yeah, but they might have recorded something that sounded good.  Yeah.  Oh.  You know what I mean?  Okay.  If anyone knows, please let us know.  I did a good one.  Oh, God.  No, you didn't, Edgar.  I did.  I told someone there's moon rocks in their soup.  Yeah.  Apple fools.  I got a text from Edgar.  Yeah. 
[00:09:00]  I was having dinner.  I was at a restaurant, and he said that there were moon rocks in my soup.  April falls.  Fucking good one.  I could not stop doing Edgar at the Yankee game yesterday.  I just couldn't stop.  April falls.  It was ridiculous stuff like, your shoes are on fire.  Was it annoying anyone?  Oh, yes, it was.  And between that and regular Joe at the baseball game, too. 
[00:09:30]  What's better than just annoying your friends?  It's the great...  There's nothing better.  It really is fun.  Regular Joe kept getting upset that people were cheering for the team, because you know  what?  I had a lot of MVPs on my own team on the job.  You know, the unsung heroes.  Oh, just a self-important douche.  How was opening day?  The Yankees got their asses handed to them, first of all.  I don't know.  Second of all...  Was I watching the Yankees?  What team was that out there? 
[00:10:00]  You didn't recognize anybody, huh?  It's just...  A lot of people say that.  I was like, oh, Robbie Cano.  Okay, I know that guy.  Well, they got a lot of guys hurt, too.  Yeah, that's just it.  It's, you know...  They got the, you know, Jeter and A-Rod obviously hurt.  Who else is hurt?  Everybody.  Fucking...  Teixeira's hurt.  Fucking...  Yeah, A-Rod.  Jeter being out is like...  You know, that pretty much takes a lot of wind out of the old sails.  Right.  It was just...  Yeah, the lineup is kind of like, oh, why? 
[00:10:30]  Very lackluster.  Is Rivera playing?  CeCe was not really on.  So, it's just, you know, watching the Red Sox.  Was it fun, though, to be out there?  Jacking balls into the fucking outfield.  It's like, oh, good.  It's Red Sox batting practice.  Yeah, it was good.  The weather was fucking amazing until later part of the game it started raining.  And it got a little chilly.  But, um...  No, it was fun. 
[00:11:00]  It was nice to get out there.  I liked it.  Yeah, a little...  That Legends area.  Oh, it was that nice.  It was terrific.  Have a dinner like a fucking white man.  And you go out there and sit in a nice seat, watch the game.  Yeah, it was fun.  You run into our ticket lady.  Huh?  No.  Oh, you're thinking...  No?  Oh, we're not allowed to say.  Oh, I have.  Oh, jeez.  We're not allowed to say.  It was wonderful.  Okay.  It's been confirmed.  Mime Radio is an official SiriusXM prank. 
[00:11:30]  Oh, my God.  Well, that's...  Yeah.  That's just...  Oh, my God.  That's just terrific.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  Were they hoping to get, like, a lot of press today?  Like, headlines everywhere.  Oh, my God.  Not going to believe what SiriusXM did.  I don't know.  But the big announcement on their Twitter got 11 retweets.  Damn.  Not bad.  Oh, my God.  They got 11 retweets? 
[00:12:00]  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  And it just said...  How many followers does their official Twitter account have?  41,000.  Jesus.  Don't you have more than that?  I do.  Yes, I do.  Wow.  You don't even have a show yet.  No.  They won't give me one.  I just do radio.  But they can't even, like...  Wait a minute.  You got so many channels, and if you put a promo on every channel, they would probably  pump up your followers.  Yesterday, I thought they had one more.  Yeah.  Mime Radio.  They had me going.  Oh, my God.  They suck. 
[00:12:30]  Look, it says, Mime Radio, channel zero, coming soon.  And then the picture of a mime.  Yeah.  Who are the dopes that retweeted it?  Probably all the executives.  Yeah.  Probably all the dump suits.  Here's what I want to know also.  Did they just find a mime picture as a stock photo, or did they pay a photographer, a mime,  a fucking thing?  I guarantee that's an original photo.  How much money went into that?  I guarantee that's an original photo. 
[00:13:00]  And then...  They got an actor.  They got a photographer.  They set up a photo shoot.  How did they actually plan something and put it up on a website on time for a certain  day when, you know, we can't get shit done?  Oh, I bet they fucking...  They put this on the fast track.  Yeah, you Google image mime in that photo.  No, that photo doesn't really show up.  No.  Yeah, it's an original photo for mime radio.  Holy shit.  What are some of the tweets about mime radio?  That was about it? 
[00:13:30]  I mean, that was literally...  Yeah, there were 11 retweets.  I'm assuming most come from people like r underscore wizard and people who weren't here.  Who's going to take credit for coming up with mime radio?  I need to know.  Can you find that?  You can find that out, right?  I'm sure.  Please find out.  Yeah, poke around.  Poke around a little bit.  But they don't want to get anybody upset.  I know.  I know.  You got to be very careful.  You got to keep it fun.  Put E-Rock on it.  He's a sneaky little shit like you.  You got a great prank. 
[00:14:00]  Like, if they really wanted to do an April Fool's Day prank, they would have to do something  that literally cost them subscribers.  Yeah.  Like, if we started losing subscribers, it would be a great April Fool's Day prank.  Right.  You think they were hoping for more retweets?  Maybe a couple little headlines today?  I bet they were watching it.  Yeah.  Double digits.  But then after 11, it kind of trialed on.  11, it just kind of went away.  Well, we also got two favorites on it. 
[00:14:30]  And whose idea?  You know someone came up with the idea.  And in a boardroom somewhere around here, they're all laughing and laughing.  It's an amazing idea.  What a terrible prank.  We need an April Fool's prank.  We need a joke.  Something for April Fool's.  Why don't we?  And somebody raised their hand.  I got one.  Right.  Here it is.  Just listen.  Hear me out.  And then he stands up and looks at everybody.  And he's quiet.  And he goes, mime radio.  Think about it.  And then he nods his head. 
[00:15:00]  Looks around the table.  And everyone's like, mime radio.  And then they start jumping in.  I can get an actor.  We'll put a good photographer on it.  We'll take a picture.  Because we can't use stock photos.  Because then they'll be on to us.  Right.  We've got to get an original mime photo.  Of a mime.  The problem is that some of the channels that we already have in real life are dumber than  mime radio.  It's mime radio.  Yeah.  Book radio?  Hello.  Book radio is mime radio.  Yeah.  Book radio is an April Fool's Day prank. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  Right.  That lady goes to our gym, by the way, and gives me a dirty look every time.  Does she really?  Yep.  You've got to point out.  By the way, I saw the fucking, the cuckold talking to his master.  The cuckold and the master.  Yeah.  Talking to his, when I walked in and there he was, fucking, the guy with the bag.  His cock was so bad yesterday.  I swear to you.  It was inside of his scrotum.  I'm not exaggerating.  And he just stands there in front of a guy that he gets completely naked as fast as he  can and he talks about the Knicks with the black guy. 
[00:16:00]  And I'm, I don't, every time, every fucking time.  Me and Jimmy went to the gym, you know, at the same time yesterday and I lost a winter  hat that I really like.  Okay.  So I went to the black guy that's usually, you know, talking to the naked dude.  Right.  And I go, Hey man, uh, you guys got a lost and found cause I lost my, you know, really  nice winter hat.  I really want to see if you guys got it.  He was such a dick to me.  And I go to Jimmy, I bet you if I was naked, he'd be cool. 
[00:16:30]  He couldn't, this guy can't be cooler to this guy that's naked.  What did he, uh, he was just really like, you know, he needs a guy to be naked.  He was bothered that I was asking him something.  Yeah.  That's why I'm so glad I did not tip that fucking guy, by the way.  I tip a lot of people on Christmas.  I just, uh, he, he, he was, he was bothered that I was asking him a question and quickly  said downstairs and then walked away from me.  I'm like, I bet you if I was fucking naked, he would take his time, answer my question. 
[00:17:00]  Well, he's probably very, um, like he, he, he looks at that now as a, a thing that you  have to be submissive to him.  I was nice.  Well, isn't that being kind of submissive?  No, you gotta be naked.  No, you gotta be naked.  No, you gotta be naked.  No, you gotta be naked.  No, you gotta be naked.  No, you gotta be naked.  No, you gotta be naked.  You gotta be naked.  You gotta be naked.  You gotta be naked.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's a really weird thing with that guy.  Like he doesn't talk to, to anybody really.  And, uh, I would, he would always say kind of hello if I said hello first, but then I threw  him 50 on Christmas.  Cause he does, I think he, he does clean up the locker room and stuff.  And, uh, he can't be nicer. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  He can't be nicer when I see him now.  I walk in and I'm like, how you doing?  Good morning.  And he's so happy to see me.  I don't get the whole thing of why that guy's gotta be naked in front of the other guy.  It's the weirdest thing.  It's a weird, he's probably a nudist.  There's some sexual thing going on.  There's very sexual vibes there because I've watched the guy, the black guy with his pants  unzippered.  I'm not exaggerating.  He might be a little slow, but I've seen him with his pants unzippered.  I'm not doing anything, but I've seen him talking like this.  Oh, he'll, he'll stand there and he's got his kind of, I saw him kind of reach down 
[00:18:00]  and just kind of like run his hand on to where the zipper is.  It was really, there's a fucking, there's, there's a very, very weird vibe.  Yeah, there's gay sex going on there.  I don't know if they're having sex.  It's gay sex.  That's gay sex.  That's gay sex.  Even if there's not like, there's sex going on, that's gay sex.  There's fucking, there's this teasing game going on.  And this whole dynamic, this gay sex dynamic between the two. 
[00:18:30]  It's just really strange.  It really is strange.  You want to know the Ron and Fez prank from yesterday?  It is.  Let's go to Oscar.  Oscar.  All right, hold on.  Before we talk to this guy about this, I will predict.  That's wrong.  This guy will not be able to convey this properly and we won't know what the fuck it was because  these people are stupid.  All right.  All right.  Let her rip.  Oh, Anthony, thanks.  Ron is a genius.  What he did was he redid a break they did back in January 2008. 
[00:19:00]  But in today's time, so when you was listening to it, he's making all these fucking predictions  about sports, death, and you thought it was like a live recording, but apparently they  stayed after Friday, made their first break.  And he had me like an hour into it until he started making these predictions about movies  that were going to win Oscars that weren't even in production yet.  And that's when he finally, I finally caught on that they were redid a break in 2008. 
[00:19:30]  I guess I...  So what you're saying is they did a live show, but they made it seem like it was a best of.  Right.  All right.  That's pretty clever.  A live show.  That's better than Mime Radio.  I'll tell you right now.  Right now.  So they're saying things that would lead you to believe that it was a show that was  recorded in 2008.  They apparently let the audience think that they were taking the day off, and they were 
[00:20:00]  playing a best of, but they were actually in studio, and then they were hinting to things  that would happen in the future, like they knew these things, but in essence, they were  really in there live.  Anthony, you're a genius, man.  I wish I could explain shit like that.  We all do, sir.  All right.  Thank you, sir.  There's nothing worse than trying to fumble through something, and then listen to Anthony  zip through it in radio perfection. 
[00:20:30]  It's humiliating.  I love our listeners.  That's pretty clever.  That is a goddamn good one.  Definitely better than Mime Radio.  I didn't hear about them getting E-11 retweets.  That is true.  How many favorites, though?  It's all about the favorites.  The big deuce.  Big deuce.  Two big favorites.  Click on the favorites.  I'll take a retweet over a favorite.  Of course.  I get mad when people favorite my stuff.  That just means they didn't want to retweet it.  Nah.  And they're going to save it for later for their own use, those fuckers.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Sometimes you inadvertently hit the favorite button.  You favorite something.  You go, fuck, I didn't want to do that.  I didn't want to favor that.  And it means so nothing that you don't even go back and unfavorite it.  So who thought Mime Radio was so good they had a favorite to tweet?  Some guy named Tyler Mims.  I mean, it's Mimes.  And Eddie A10.  Yeah.  Eddie is always good for retweets.  So the executives have fake Twitter accounts.  I like Mimis.  I love Mim Radio. 
[00:21:30]  I was listening.  Did they at least put it on the front page of their website?  No.  That's the thing.  They didn't even commit to it?  There's no link to it.  Oh.  There's just a link to the photo.  If you're going to do it, why wouldn't you put it on the front page?  Like, you know.  No?  What's on the front page?  You just go to SiriusXM slash Mime Radio and it's page not found.  Why wouldn't they set up a page for a little bit?  Oh, please.  Now you're talking like, now the fucking web guy has to get involved. 
[00:22:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That means people actually would have to work.  Keep it fun, but don't confuse the people.  I mean, it's opening day.  We don't want to distract from that.  It's all about baseball.  Oh, fucking A, man.  They do pretty much have every baseball game on, right?  Yeah.  They do every game, so that's pretty impressive.  Yeah.  We never talk about the positive stuff of the company.  I think that's pretty impressive.  Oh, it's impressive. 
[00:22:30]  I mean, it costs them $8 billion a year to get the broadcast rights, but it is impressive.  Yeah.  I like what they did at the Yankee Stadium.  There's so many injuries.  You know, a lot of the star players aren't there.  Right.  And they weren't really looking very good yesterday.  And the stadium knows what to do.  At every break, they were throwing up highlights on the big screen of, you know, all the stars.  Yesteryear.  And great plays and stuff.  And everyone's looking like, yeah, and then you realize, ah, that's not what I'm seeing here today. 
[00:23:00]  That's not what's going on on the field today, is it?  Oh, boy.  They're smart, though.  Yeah, yeah.  They know how to market themselves.  Oh, yeah.  But who wants to see that when you're losing on opening day?  Oh, look, it's a double by Roy White.  Oh, good.  Look at that.  Chris Chambliss.  Good old Chris Chambliss.  Advanced runner.  Good old Chris Chambliss.  Oh, shit.  I love a good Chris Chambliss reference.  Yes, I like Chris Chambliss.  Yeah.  Well, Sirius XM wasn't the only place that did a douchey April Fool's prank. 
[00:23:30]  The White House.  Oh, the White House.  Well, that seems a little odd.  Well, I was watching the news yesterday, and they're like, you're not going to believe what the White House did today.  And they show this empty podium.  I believe that.  And I couldn't wait through the commercials.  I didn't give a fuck.  I didn't give a fuck to wait.  Click.  And we do a show where you got to kind of like be in the know.  And I just couldn't stick around to see what craziness the White House was up to. 
[00:24:00]  Uh-huh.  How great would it be if they did something true?  Like if Obama came out naked or with fake tits?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Yeah, that would be a good one.  Why not, though, in the end?  Do something that's a little more clever than this.  Let me see.  I want to see what happened here.  This is the White House.  This is the White House.  A special message from the president.  They didn't actually do it in front of anybody.  What?  This isn't the real press room.  Oh, it's not.  Like they didn't gather press and say. 
[00:24:30]  No.  Oh, this was a producer.  See, that would have been funny.  But why don't they do it in front of the real press?  What would happen?  Well, we don't want to upset anybody.  Who would get pissed off by that on April Fool's?  Only people that it doesn't matter.  This is why.  That's the joke.  Back in the day, the reason we did the mayor's prank, I was so sick of these stupid April Fool's pranks where people don't commit.  Yeah.  And me and I were like, if we're going to do this, we've got to fucking commit.  You can't do this, you know, half-assed. 
[00:25:00]  Right.  So we fucking committed.  And to this day, they come up with these ideas, but they don't fucking commit whatsoever.  Why wouldn't you just do this exact prank in front of the actual press?  Right.  Have them take questions.  Especially if you know it's a slow news day and everything is sort of all right.  You know what I mean?  You know what prank I pulled one time?  I actually told this girl, like, yeah, I'll give you a great fuck.  And then after I came in like a minute, she was like, where's my great fuck? 
[00:25:30]  And I went, April Fool's.  That's better than what the White House did.  And they didn't even do it in front of everyone.  So this is like a Jimmy Fallon bit.  Which is viral.  I just insulted Jimmy Fallon.  I love Jimmy Fallon.  Viral.  So I'm taking that back.  You mean that it's a bit that was not done in front of the press.  So Jimmy Fallon bits are best how they are.  Yeah, but Jimmy Fallon bits you laugh at.  Right.  Let me see this.  I've got to see this now.  It's got to be bigger.  All right.  This was released by the White House. 
[00:26:00]  Wacking music.  It looks like you were expecting somebody else.  But April Fool's on all y'all.  I'm the kid president and I hope everyone has an awesome day.  It's everybody's duty to give the world a reason to dance.  I'm into the White House.  I'm here.  Please.  Stupid green screen.  Watch this. 
[00:26:30]  He walks away farting.  I think I'm stuck.  They probably sent that into the White House and they just...  No.  Look.  That's too...  Whitehouse.gov.  You guys want outtakes?  They have outtakes.  Oh, I love a good outtake, man.  Of course I want outtakes.  Me too.  Dom DeLuise laughing.  Oh, fantastic.  Woo!  I don't know what this is doing.  It's just...  It's kind of like an iPad and it's just showing up at the White House and it's wanting me 
[00:27:00]  to click it.  That's how I am.  Don't click it.  Oh, how do you guys stand these lights?  Fucking hilarious.  Fucking good one, kid.  Wow.  I thought that was the president.  No, you didn't.  We just don't know shit on this show anymore. 
[00:27:30]  Why would 5,354 people like that and only 700 people not?  People aren't that jaded.  People aren't as jaded.  Are we just jaded?  That's horrendous.  They're looking at it like, ah, it's just a kid, cute kid who cares.  It doesn't bother people.  Even people that didn't laugh at it won't go like that's...  Like, those dislikes are people who go, this fucking sucked.  Like...  Get so angry.  Yeah, like, we're really overreacting.  Like, we should look at that and go, ah, you know.  Yeah, whatever.  But instead, I look at that and I'm like, why would they do that or the mime thing? 
[00:28:00]  Right.  Instead of just going, ah.  You know, it's like, you know, why the fuck didn't they hire a real mime?  We get angry at stuff we shouldn't get angry at.  We're wrong.  But usually when you have a kid in a comedy piece, it's, you know, it's pretty funny.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's like a go-to thing.  That was horrible.  Oh, did you see the fucking, these Texas DAs showed up alive?  They said the whole thing with the Aryans killing them was an April Fool's joke?  April Fool's.  Holy shit.  How fucking frightening is that?  They're not playing.  Oof. 
[00:28:30]  They're not fucking playing.  Oh, yeah.  God damn.  Yeah, they're...  Take all the fun out of the room.  I just happened to see that.  Yeah, they're ruthless.  They don't fucking play games, man.  They're not playing games.  Fully support whoever.  That's terrible.  I'm not getting involved with that shit.  That's scary fucking shit.  When the prosecutors are getting killed.  Holy fuck.  I'm surprised it doesn't happen more, though, to be very honest.  It's a ballsy move.  Yeah, no shit it is.  That's some crazy shit.  But it's going to backfire.  Oh, of course it is.  Only because when you do that, you force the government to respond. 
[00:29:00]  They have to.  They have to.  It's like when a cop gets shot.  It's the whole thing that, you know, society is based on.  You can't really allow people to start plugging fucking prosecutors.  Yeah, because as much as prosecutors, I'm sure if you're a criminal or if you're being investigated, suck.  They are really...  Can't throw a monkey wrench into the legal system like that.  That's a weird one, man.  Yeah, wow.  They will fuck you.  The mob doesn't do it.  No.  No one kills the prosecutors. 
[00:29:30]  Unless they're in Colombia or something like that.  Yeah, yeah.  Or fucking Mexico.  Well, that was fucking...  Yeah.  Oof.  Anyway, so the White House did their fucking prank.  It was amazing.  That is something.  And then we got a Florida radio station.  Did something and, I don't know.  The jocks got suspended.  What?  Fired?  So fired?  I don't know.  The whole thing could be a prank.  What?  You want to listen?  Sure do.  We got several emails and phone calls wondering if the water in Lee County was safe to drink. 
[00:30:00]  It is.  Turns out a couple of local radio DJs tried to be funny with an April Fool's Day...  Oh, God.  Dude, I get...  Break out our fucking press clippings.  I got a little cringy.  I got that feeling like, oh, God, oh, no, don't, oh, don't talk about us.  Really?  Yeah.  That sounds too familiar.  Yeah, we've been through a couple of those, huh?  Oh, they're going with the water prank?  Yeah.  We got several emails and phone calls wondering if the water in Lee County was safe to drink. 
[00:30:30]  It is.  Turns out a couple of local radio DJs tried to be funny with an April Fool's Day prank.  And now the two who started the rumor are off the air.  NBC News' Megan Smith reports all new at 6.  Live alligator.  Try our drink special.  The day is notorious for pulling pranks.  The Lighthouse Inn resort and...  April Fool's Day at Gator Country has always been fun until now.  We are very sorry.  A hoax by Valance Scott in the morning sent people into a panic with concerns over Lee  County's water quality. 
[00:31:00]  This messes with the big three.  Food, water.  What?  The whole thing is fake.  Oh, look, look, look.  There's a thing on the website that says, vote here.  When should Valance Scott return to the airwaves?  Oh, God.  On their website.  They've suspended these guys because they're so angry with what they did.  But then on their website, they have a vote here.  They don't know how to do shit.  When should Valance Scott return to the airwaves?  And the choices are immediately, tomorrow, Monday, or never. 
[00:31:30]  Imagine if everyone voted never.  Never.  Wait, they got the press, but they got the press involved, right?  They got the press to bite.  The press did something on it.  What happens is they panic.  Yeah.  Why wouldn't you just sit on this for a couple days?  Why wouldn't you jump with this crap right away?  Because, Opie, we want to drive traffic to the website.  We want to drive traffic.  And then, sadly, they're going to realize that no one gives a fuck about Valance Scott in the end. 
[00:32:00]  Well, I think a lot of people should go there and vote.  You know, I would hope people would go to Valance Scott's site and vote.  It's a comment.  Do whatever you need to.  Do they have a Facebook page?  The website where you can vote is gatorcountry1019.com.  Okay.  And there is a Facebook.  Gatorcountry1019.  Their profile for their morning show is still up.  Yeah, I know.  It goes down.  I guess I was going to say, but I think most of the listeners know by now.  When you get in trouble with a company, a radio company.  You're gone. 
[00:32:30]  They remove every fucking mention and picture of you immediately.  They don't make it a contest.  No, of course not.  They make believe you never worked there.  Right.  How amazing would it be if the whole August 2002 thing was simply a well-orchestrated April Fool's prank done at a time for a decade,  and then we just went back on NEW tomorrow and we were just kidding.  It was a decade prank.  Aha, we got you.  That would be wonderful.  Oh, boy.  There's a, if you go to facebook.com slash gatorcountry1019. 
[00:33:00]  Okay.  There's a whole, a lot of people are conversing about this.  What are they saying?  I mean, well, right now stuff like, you suck for suspending Val and Scott.  And while I agree, Val and Scott could have said April Fool's after their statement.  If you graduated high school, you should know what it means.  Oh, boy.  It's not Val and Scott's fault that people are stupid.  Well, I mean, we'll see how the, how the conversation continues.  Yeah, wow, a lot of people seem to be off in arms. 
[00:33:30]  What's the Facebook page for people who want to, you know, read the support?  Oh, for, yeah, gatorcountry1019.  Is there a Facebook page?  I bet if you refresh right now.  Just go ahead and refresh it?  To see if anybody is.  Sure.  Anyone commenting?  I'm going to see all.  I hope it's for nature.  Not just yet.  Not just yet.  Hold on.  We're on a little delay.  Jesus Christ.  You want the news story?  The fuck?  Oh, yeah, please.  All right.  We'll get back to you in a second, Sam. 
[00:34:00]  Let me play the news story from the start again.  We got several emails and phone calls wondering if the water in Lee County was safe to drink.  It is.  Turns out a couple of local radio DJs tried to be funny within April.  Trying to be funny.  Shut up.  Now the two who started the rumor are off the air.  NBC2's Megan Smith reports all new at 6.  Live alligator.  Try our drink special.  The day is notorious for pulling pranks.  The Lighthouse Inn Resort.  April Fool's Day at Gator Country has always been fun until now. 
[00:34:30]  We are very sorry.  A hoax by Val and Scott in the morning sent people.  Wait, we got to stop already?  What's going on?  I guess their Facebook page has.  I don't know.  I don't know how this adds to the conversation.  What are you talking about, Sam?  Explain, please.  We'll write in the mix of all the comments about Val and Scott being possibly fired.  Sure, yes.  There's a photo of Andrew Dice Clay looking disgusted at Sal bronzered up in a thong. 
[00:35:00]  Yeah.  And the comment just says, boo.  But that's from our show.  That's crazy.  Yeah, that's crazy.  They're fans of ours?  How did that get up there?  Sal's got his handlebar mustache and everything.  Yeah.  All right.  Okay.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Strange.  So is that supporting Val and...  I forgot their names already.  Scott.  Scott and Val.  Val and Scott.  Whatever.  Val.  What?  Oh, jeez.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  What is...  What?  Oh, no.  Chip and Bobo.  Chip.  I see Bobo. 
[00:35:30]  I see the guy sucking a cock.  That's not helpful.  Sucking a giant cock.  I guess that's how they show their support.  I don't know.  I'm confused.  Do you think that person...  Oh, boy, you got me, cunts.  When do you think they want them to return?  I wonder if they voted.  Oh, Stephen, that's not helpful.  Yeah, Stephen Knight suggests he's voting.  You should suspend Val and Scott with a shotgun blast to the head.  Oh, see, that's not nice.  Stop now.  April Fools!  Oh, I thought he meant that. 
[00:36:00]  Whoa.  Back to the news story.  Val and Scott in the morning sent people into a panic with concerns over Lee County's water quality.  This messes with the big three.  Food, water, and shelter.  You can't mess with those.  And we did.  General Manager Tony Rendon heard the prank as he pulled into the Bonita Springs station around 8.30 this morning.  Frustration and surprise.  For years, they've put on great radio.  And every year, April Fools' Day is something fun. 
[00:36:30]  And this year was a little bit different.  Val and Scott were joking that dihydrogen dioxide was coming out of Lee County residents' taps.  That's another name for water.  But many who didn't know that thought it may have been unsafe to drink.  That led to several calls at Lee County Utilities.  They were asking about the water quality, and that's what we wanted to reassure them that the water was safe to drink.  Lee County Utilities immediately called Gator Country to find out if they've been fooled themselves.  So we went ahead and we made sure that we contacted the general manager and the station to at least get them to stop reporting that and to let them know that the water was safe to drink. 
[00:37:00]  The Utilities Department then issued this press release, letting the public know that they are not having any issues with the water supply and the water is safe to drink.  For Fools' Day.  Gator Country has spent the day getting that message out and apologizing through their other hosts.  As for Val and Scott, they've been suspended indefinitely.  In Lee County, Megan Smith, NBC2. 
[00:37:30]  The Department of Environmental Protection did look into the matter, but a spokesperson tells us the agency isn't pursuing the situation any further at this point.  Because the radio station acted appropriately after the hoax, and the Lee County Department of Health acted quickly to educate the public.  You know what? It's a douchey prank, but this little local show...  Yeah, yeah, they got some heat.  They played on the dumbness of the press.  Right.  And the fucking absolute stupidity of a non-story.  And probably when, you know, they realized...  Jesus Christ. 
[00:38:00]  When they realized everyone was cool with the prank, then the radio station spun it to, you know, take advantage of it.  You could tell when the general manager gets on and starts talking about, you know, for years they've done great radio.  Like he's pitching the show that he's suspending.  Consider me the third member of the opening at this show.  Run your pranks by me.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I know a good April Fool's prank.  You know, when I heard it, outrage.  Oh my God.  Surprise.  I don't have deuces like that in my life.  Why is Bobo's penis on their face? 
[00:38:30]  That's not helpful at all.  And Sam just measured me.  Oh, Sam.  I don't have anything to do with this.  Oh, Jesus.  A monkey saying the fuck I gave went that-a-way and pointing in a different direction.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, boy, yeah.  Crazy.  So what's going on here?  Well, it's obviously...  See, here's the thing.  No one's outraged.  Right.  There wasn't any outrage, there wasn't any call for their suspension, that law enforcement 
[00:39:00]  didn't get involved and say anything.  And then the GM just decides, out of the fucking blue, that he's going to suspend his morning  show when no one cared.  Right.  Wow, that's fucking good.  Now they're doing some contesting.  Yeah, some contesting.  Regular radio loves a good contest.  They're driving traffic to the website.  They're driving traffic to the website.  They're getting everyone talking around the water coolers. 
[00:39:30]  That's good.  But why wouldn't you...  Gotta give it to them.  You know, there's some good shit happened here.  Why wouldn't you just sit on it for a couple days?  Instead of panicking and getting something on your website immediately.  They might be afraid of losing that momentum.  Strike while the iron's hot.  We got momentum.  We're going to run with this.  Yeah, I guess.  Oh, boy, how does that help this situation?  Is that a giant black dick in a white man's hiney?  Oh, boy.  Yeah, it is.  How does that help the situation, Sam?  How is that?  Well, it depends on what your situation is.  Now, if you look at that, when do you think they want the morning show back on the air? 
[00:40:00]  Now.  Immediately.  It's ASAP.  A couple of days.  Immediately before that gentleman buries it.  Balls deep.  Holy fuck.  Wow.  It says Andy Cain says, Scott is a cuckold.  Now clean it up.  And I'm assuming Andrew Black is suggesting a replacement morning show, because he just  writes, Slabo!  Slabo!  Slabo!  Is E-Rock happy that Kevin Pollack is in on the whole Slabo thing? 
[00:40:30]  No.  I bet not.  No, E-Rock?  I prefer not, but it's all right.  It's kind of cool that you've got a big Hollywood star, though.  It's got Slabo around his house.  Can we check the results of the poll?  Yeah, let me...  Oh, that's a good idea.  Let's see what they actually think in here.  Yeah, let's get the pulse of the people.  Now, the poll results from voting.  Let's take a look at the results.  All right.  Vote here. 
[00:41:00]  Wow, a lot of traffic.  Results.  Okay.  You have to vote first, Sam.  Vote.  I looked at it a minute ago.  You should vote.  Yeah, just vote.  Let me throw it.  Why would you say never?  Oh, shit.  I clicked the wrong name.  Why would you say never?  You've got to support your fellow broadcasters.  I know.  We're all one happy family.  You know that.  We taught you that.  I think...  Did they close down voting?  They may be having some issues with servers and such.  Because the voting and results page is no longer...  Well, maybe somebody can tell us what the votes are. 
[00:41:30]  Yeah, what's happening?  What were they saying at one point?  I mean, the last time I checked, it was only 8% of people saying never.  Oh, they didn't tell you how many votes, though?  Just percentage?  No, just percentage.  Oh, they don't tell you how many votes?  Not that I saw, but like I said...  Oh, God.  When you have a poll, it's cool to see how many actual votes you're getting.  Now you don't want people to know if you only have 100 people voting.  That's true.  I can't believe we can't get to the results.  Yeah, we're having some trouble.  Boy, that's weird.  Same.  Click results.  Oh, there it is.  Oh, Jesus Christ. 
[00:42:00]  Oh, no.  What happened?  Well, right now...  It was only 8%.  That's not bad?  Well, no.  The results have changed.  Yeah.  Immediately is down to 25% of the vote.  Oh, what?  Okay.  Wednesday, tomorrow, is at 3.1% of the vote.  Nothing.  Monday is at 0.3% of the vote.  Never has a whopping 71%.  Oh, no.  See, that...  ...percent of the vote.  See, now what will they do? 
[00:42:30]  What will they do if the people vote never, and now they have to say...  I hope it's some weird way they have to do what the people say.  They have to fire them.  I hope there's some kind of loophole that they're forced to do what the people say.  And make sure you all get your votes in.  Wednesday or Monday are your options.  What?  They don't want to give the radio guys too many free days off, I guess.  Oh, you think so?  Oh, fuck yeah.  Yeah, exactly.  Of course.  They're sitting home right now going, what a great one. 
[00:43:00]  We finally cracked the fool's gag.  When they go back on the air tomorrow, Sam, I guarantee they'll be back tomorrow, you  gotta roll audio for us, okay?  It's GatorCountry1019.com to vote.  All right.  Of course it is.  You monitor them.  Maybe we'll do a little Jocktober tomorrow, because it's gonna be douchey when they're  back on the radio tomorrow.  I would like to hear what they sound like.  I mean, it's country.  Do you think that the DVOs are constantly checking?  Yes, of course they are.  They got nothing else going on.  This is their big fucking deal. 
[00:43:30]  Hey, it's been two minutes.  Can we see what the results are up to now?  And do you think that we're just being dicks?  A good natured little press grab that they have?  Ah, we're being complete assholes about it.  Wrecking us.  We're just drawing their good fun.  Well, you can't check results.  People are voting.  People are really...  People must be voting very...  We just trample everything.  Trample, trample, trample.  Yeah, it's like cocksuckers.  Can we go back to the Facebook page while you try to get the results page going?  Oh, right.  Yeah, let's see what the word on the street is. 
[00:44:00]  Yeah, what's the word on the street?  Fans of gator country.  Oh, that's a cock.  Hey, wait a minute.  There's a cock on my house.  Iraq is fat, one person says.  Oh, what does that have to do with it?  Oh, this person is, I guess, die of gator AIDS.  Oh, gator AIDS.  Translates to never.  Really?  Oh, they should do that.  It's gator country.  Yeah.  Magic Johnson blood in Lee County water.  Find out at 10.  Oh, gee.  He'll do his Magic Johnson jokes.  Oh, I understand why all these weird comments are coming in. 
[00:44:30]  Yeah.  Sean Shark clears it up.  He writes Slobo, and then he writes Iraq Radio Sent Us.  Oh.  So that would be why.  His little Iraq prank.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I got a tree on my house.  There's Buck Angel.  Buck Angel.  Oh, Buck Angel.  Oh, jeez.  I got a cock on my house again.  A lot of cock pictures.  Yeah.  Why is that?  Well, why wouldn't you?  I don't know.  Oh.  Oh, there's Jim Norton with lipstick on it.  Oh, that's my old Twitter picture.  Wonderful shot right there.  It's very delightful. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Do you like that picture?  Why do you have a seatbelt on in that picture?  Because I was in the, it was for a Tonight Show shoot when we did our Comic-Con.  I was just getting ready to go back to the hotel.  Gotcha.  I just snapped a really sexy photo.  On Golden Pond.  Just, just, get it?  I don't get that.  Who's in that?  I don't know.  On Golden Pond.  Who's it?  The kid?  What?  On Golden Pond.  I don't get that.  One person just writes goodbye, Val and Scott.  And we can't get back to the results page? 
[00:45:30]  I could try.  Ah, it's very difficult.  It must have a lot of traffic.  Yeah.  It's a popular station.  Vote here.  When should Val and Scott return to the airwaves?  Oh, my God.  Who gives a fuck?  When should Val and Scott return to the airwaves?  Let's see the results.  Oh, wow.  Okay, the results have changed.  Oh, good.  I mean, their fans are coming out and really supporting them.  All right, good.  Hopefully, in their favor.  A lot of buzz on the Facebook page.  All right.  It looks like immediately...  Yeah.  That was at 25%, I believe.  It's actually gone down.  Oh, man.  To 13.6%. 
[00:46:00]  Okay.  What was it when we first logged on?  Immediately?  Yeah.  It was at over 85%.  Wow.  So that's what most people wanted.  Yeah, that's gone down quite a bit.  Oh, oh.  Man, something has changed.  Yes, indeed.  I wonder what it is.  Maybe everybody wants them back on...  No, Wednesday has gone down to 1.6%.  Oh, shit.  All right, so what, Monday, I guess, would be the day?  That must be the big percentage.  Monday's actually decreased quite a bit to just 0.2 of a percentage.  Wow.  0.2%. 
[00:46:30]  Yeah.  That's not many.  All right, so then what?  With never being your final option.  And last time we checked never, never was at 71.5.  71.  71.5.  Okay.  It's down 84.6% of the vote.  Oh, boy.  Is never.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Oh, what?  88.2%.  You just refreshed and went up to 88.  Yeah, I did.  It's at 88.2. 
[00:47:00]  Just a small little show trying to make their mark.  Just trying to make their way through this wacky, topsy-turvy world of radio.  You know what?  Fuck them.  No one fucking helped us while we were in that position.  Yeah, well.  No one hurt you either.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  Wow, what's going on there, Sam?  What the fuck?  This is on their Facebook page, the support page?  Yeah, there's a photo of a white young lady.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, boy. 
[00:47:30]  Except it looks like there's one black erect penis is perched on her butt cheek.  Right, ready to just go for a dip.  He's ready to bury it.  And then there's another black penis attached to a black man.  Wow.  The woman's holding it, positioning it towards her mouth.  Right.  And the caption says, get Val back on.  Oh, my God.  Oh, boy.  That would lead someone to speculate.  Yeah.  Right.  Who the woman in the photo is.  Right, right. 
[00:48:00]  That's just dirty.  Who gives a fuck about dirty water?  Oh, my God.  More slobo shouts.  Slobo!  Slobo.  Uh.  Oh.  More cocks on houses.  A lot of dick pictures.  I don't get that at all.  You're like a fan.  Um.  Let's see if the poll has changed at all.  Okay.  Check the results.  Okay.  If they want them back.  Yeah, the poll has changed somewhat.  What?  All right, good.  We were at 88.2% for never.  Right.  Yeah.  Now we'll go through it again. 
[00:48:30]  Immediately, it's actually gone down.  Oh, we've dipped down out of the double digits.  Yeah.  Of 10%.  It's at 9.2%.  Oh.  Wow.  The news must be doing more fucking pieces on this story.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  For the polls to change this drastically.  Well, the genuine outrage is there now.  Right.  Right.  With Wednesday tomorrow.  Okay.  Being a small 1.1%.  Wow.  Okay.  Monday has gone down from 0.2 of a percent to 0.1.  Oh, wow.  Wow.  A percent never has indeed taken the lead at 89.5% of the vote. 
[00:49:00]  They're going to log on to that and go, let's see how the voting's going.  Holy fuck, what happened?  All right.  Well, we just refreshed it.  Oh, okay.  And never has cemented itself with 90.3%.  Now in the 90 percentile.  Wow, this show's fucked.  Yeah, 90% of the voters are pissed off.  The people have spoken.  They don't like shenanigans like that.  No, with that water, they don't want it to be a three.  The big three.  Water.  You know what the problem is? 
[00:49:30]  They're learning the hard way.  You don't fuck with water.  Yeah.  Yeah.  If we, everybody should take all their stuff off the Facebook page now, delete every comment  you've made, because they're going to know that something's happening based on the weird  shit on their Facebook.  Oh, perhaps.  If there was nothing on their Facebook, they would just think that the community is an  outrage.  Like, wow, they really are outraged.  I love how Sam is trying to put the toothpaste back into the fucking tube.  Right, right, right, right.  What are you talking about, Sam?  Yeah, people are going to take the black cock photos off.  Good one.  I'm sure.  I'm sure that's what's going to happen. 
[00:50:00]  Monday has gone up to point, back to point two.  Okay.  Wow.  All right.  Unfortunately, never has also gone up to 90.8.  How did Monday go up?  I don't know.  Somebody must have inadvertently clicked Monday.  What do you think they meant to click?  Never.  Oh.  All right.  Let's check the Facebook, I guess.  All right.  Let's go back to the Facebook.  Refresh action.  Oh, wow.  These guys are getting a lot of attention today.  I'm surprised nobody's really, I don't know, there's a picture of Kamala. 
[00:50:30]  Hey, look.  It's Denny.  There's a picture of Denny.  Hey, is Denny in yet?  I can find out.  Denny.  Well, he's our radio expert.  I want to hear his thoughts on a good April Fool's prank.  What makes a good radio April Fool's prank?  Is he in yet?  Yeah, he's coming out.  Oh, good.  Oh, thank God.  The category here, I mean, the caption.  Yeah.  For Denny?  For Denny.  Under it, it says.  Our radio expert?  Yes.  DJ Denny says, your prank sucks. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, he would never say that.  I don't know if he would ever say that.  That's not fair for Denny.  There's Jason Statham just looking confused.  Like, why would you do that?  See, those are the ones I really like.  That's just fucking clever.  Oh, no.  There's a picture of a syphilis-infected.  God.  And then you go back to the easy ones.  I don't know.  I kind of like the syphilis cock.  That's a bit more jarring.  There's a picture of a dog trying to look casual.  And under it, it says, nigga, be cool. 
[00:51:30]  The police behind you.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, that's cray.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit.  One comment says, Sam Roberts wants your job.  He is also douche.  I would assume.  Hey, douche is what was meant.  Where is he?  Hey, there he is.  Denny.  No clipboard.  Dennis Falcone.  No clipboard.  They told me, get in here now. 
[00:52:00]  Oh, shit.  You were working on the clipboard.  So, yesterday was April Fool's.  Yes.  And we want to know your opinion on a good April Fool's prank a radio station could pull.  Because, as you know, you know our history, right?  We've pulled a few.  Yes.  Yes, you have.  There was one that I saw on one of the sites this morning, a station in North Carolina,  maybe, who did a live broadcast from an imaginary pancake house.  And they said, you know, for anybody to come on down, everybody comes down and you get 12 free pancakes.  They never gave out the location. 
[00:52:30]  They had sound effects going on in the background, interviewing, you know, mock chefs and customers.  Like that?  I thought that was pretty fun.  Yes.  I thought that was pretty fun.  That's not bad, actually.  Yeah, I mean.  It was safe.  It was a safe one.  It was funny.  Safe is most important, right?  When you're thinking of an April Fool's prank, safety.  No.  They took a page out of Jerry Martier's playbook.  Oh.  Oh, right.  Dennis Falcone.  The Gin Joint.  The Gin Joint.  An imaginary fucking happy hour place every Friday.  Right.  People really thought that was a real place. 
[00:53:00]  And they would call the station every Friday trying to figure out where this fucking cool  place was.  Yeah.  People would do that.  But I think the reason they do it now is just to get press.  Just like what you're doing now is talking about them.  Oh, yeah.  You're talking about a little radio station on some national press.  You got it.  For about five minutes.  It wasn't anything scary or anybody.  No one got hurt.  But do you have guidelines for a good April Fool's prank?  I guess no one should get hurt.  No one.  I think that would be it.  You know, you don't want to get in trouble.  You know, seriously. 
[00:53:30]  You could get fired.  Oh.  You probably don't want to cause any kind of panic.  No, no widespread panic.  Of course not.  Right.  Right.  Hurt anyone's feelings?  I remember that band.  Feelings is okay.  Yeah.  Hurting feelings is okay.  Oh, it's okay.  I mean, feelings is okay.  Edgy just hasn't had his coffee yet.  I did one once when I worked at a radio station.  And I used the, I said, if anyone sitting in section 103, because that was the dial position  of the station I worked at, call the Islanders immediately.  And they, and like 20 minutes later, we had a call from the Islanders saying, are you giving 
[00:54:00]  out information saying there's a problem with the seats?  I said, no, I just denied it.  Ah, good one.  I got real nervous and denied it.  Yeah.  No, no, no, no.  I just maybe gave the score.  Real nervous and denied it.  I wanted to be the zany DJ who got fired, and then you'd get some national press and we  offered a big job.  That happens.  It used to happen that way, but now they fire you and you're done.  Yeah, because they don't want to deal with, you know, they don't want to deal with lawsuits  and trouble like that.  There was a culture in radio where you try to get fired because you knew you would get 
[00:54:30]  a better gig.  And it happened and worked out for a lot of people that way.  Now, sadly, there's not all those gigs.  They'll just give that gig to Ryan Seacrest.  Uh-huh.  You like Ryan Seacrest.  He's a talented guy.  No, he's not.  He's a talented guy.  He's fucking not a talented guy.  He's today's Dick Clark.  He's today's Dick Clark.  He's beige.  He's just one of those colors.  Maybe beige is in it.  He's a host.  He's a host.  He's a color that people just don't mind. 
[00:55:00]  He's not talented.  He's a host.  He's, you know, again, when Dick Clark brought rock and roll into the homes, people saw that  it was safe because Dick Clark was very safe and homogenized and people liked it.  Yeah, but I don't think you could say talent and host.  A host is just a host.  But sometimes something might just call for a host.  Name a bad host.  A bad host?  I guess guys who have no ratings are bad hosts.  Well, you can't come up with a name, though.  No.  That's my point.  They're not memorable.  Yeah.  And the good ones aren't memorable and the bad ones aren't memorable. 
[00:55:30]  Maybe the bad ones didn't pull some good Halloween, April Fool's stunts.  Who's a good host?  That's a good question.  There's like, is Ryan Seacrest, to be totally subjective, objective, is he a good host, like,  for what they want?  No one cares enough is my point.  You could line up a whole bunch of people and they would do the exact job Ryan Seacrest  is doing.  That's my point.  What about Bergeron?  You like Tom Bergeron, Dancing with the Stars?  No, they're just hosts.  Who gives a fuck?  He's successful.  Billy Bush is a bad host.  Who's that? 
[00:56:00]  He's not even a bad host.  I understand what you're saying.  He's kind of douchey, but what makes him a bad host?  He's annoying to watch.  Yeah.  He bothers me.  I don't like to get the news from him.  Nick Cannon's a host.  I wouldn't say a good host.  He's just a host.  He also got a countdown show out of it.  There's a weekly countdown special.  Chris Jericho.  Yeah.  Robot Wars.  That's right.  A host.  Killer host.  Fucking rock.  When's he coming in?  I don't know.  A couple days.  Thursday, maybe?  We got Chris Jericho. 
[00:56:30]  I want to discuss that show.  Our old pal.  Where's Gator Country?  Gator Country right now?  Yeah.  It's in Philly.  Florida, Louisiana.  Where is it?  90.5% of their listeners are hoping that they never come back on the air.  Right.  Wow.  That's a huge, huge margin.  You think that's not what they were hoping for?  I don't think so.  I think these guys said, this backfired.  What did you think of the big SiriusXM prank that got everybody talking?  You know, 11 retweets.  Mine radio.  What's that?  11 retweets.  Really? 
[00:57:00]  You got 11 retweets on this.  11.  That's pretty good.  Blowing up the Twitter, huh?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Did you for a second think, whoa, what are we doing here?  No.  They didn't get you going.  No, that didn't get my goat.  You don't like mime radio?  Not really, no.  You don't like it as a prank, though?  You don't like it as something that might get people a-talking?  It was, uh...  It's dumb.  I really...  No, it's dumb.  It's dumb, because they try to figure out, you know, the one thing they could do that  doesn't fucking offend anyone.  Did this make the trades? 
[00:57:30]  I didn't see it yet on the trades.  I was just going through my prep services when I got the alarm to come down to the studio.  Yeah.  The other DJs aren't going around saying, well, SiriusXM had people thinking they were starting  a mime radio channel.  I don't think Terrestrial Radio is going to even mention us.  No, no.  Oh, by the way, my...  I was doing great with the host thing, but someone's got a bad host, and they're right.  Khloe Kardashian was a horrendous bad host.  And it's so hard to be a bad host, is my point, I guess. 
[00:58:00]  Well, she was...  She was on X Factor.  She was horrendously bad.  They didn't resign her, right?  No, she was terrible.  They bailed on her.  And she's the one Kardashian that shows some kind of a personality out of those three fucking...  Well, she just got the job because she was a name.  Dead eyes.  So that was the only reason they put her into that position.  Sometimes a lot of people get jobs, and they just fail at them, and they shouldn't.  She was a horrendous host, so you're right.  Ayesha, it looks like, from Connecticut.  Ayesha.  Ayesha.  Maria Menounos is a good host.  She's a host. 
[00:58:30]  She's a good host.  She's just there.  I think you could be a good host.  You've got to be the host with the most.  She's just there.  That's the best host.  She's good looking.  Yeah, I think you can be a good or bad host.  I mean, even...  Yeah, but we can't really come up with a list of good hosts and bad hosts.  I think Ryan Seacrest is a good host, even though it's not what I like.  Right.  When you watch him...  He just keeps it going.  He's not going to offend anyone.  But he also...  He's where they need him to be.  He says what they need him to say.  His personality keeps things going.  Like, just being totally objective and going, my jaded humor notwithstanding. 
[00:59:00]  Right.  Like, if I had a gig where I'd want someone to host, would I want him to do it or Dave Attell?  I'd probably want Dave Attell because it would make me laugh.  But if I needed shit to move along properly, I'd want Ryan.  Because that's what he does.  All right.  How about Peter Marshall, Hollywood Squares?  That was a host.  Peter Marshall, Hollywood Squares.  Or Sarah Purcell and Those Amazing Animals.  I preferred her on Real People, Welcome to Real People.  I fucking love them.  Those amazing animals.  He went with those amazing animals.  It was a fun show. 
[00:59:30]  It was.  It was a fun show.  Didn't bother anyone, right?  No.  Wasn't she on Real People?  Yeah.  Sarah Purcell, Welcome to Real People.  I believe it was her spinoff.  They decided she might be the big star over there.  So Amazing Animals is hers?  I think so.  Paul in for the block.  Paul?  Oh, wow.  And Jim Stafford.  Jim Stafford, who did Spiders and Snakes, was also on that show.  Was he?  Yeah.  I believe he was on that show.  I don't like spiders and snakes, but that ain't what it takes to love me.  What's that? 
[01:00:00]  It's an old fucking song.  Yeah, Jim Stafford.  Yeah.  And also had My Girl Bill.  Wait, do you want him to talk it up?  And Wildwood Weed.  I ramped up some songs yesterday.  They were a little sloppy, but I did ramp them.  It's okay, but the good thing is you can practice.  All the time.  Do you practice in the car?  Not yet.  Ew, did you do that?  You've got to practice in the car, right?  Yeah.  Did you see the Islanders knockout?  Yes.  Holy fuck.  Beat in the Devils 3-1.  That was a nice one.  That was a nice one.  Did you see the fight?  Did you see the fight?  Did you see the fight?  No, I came home late.  Didn't see the fight. 
[01:00:30]  Guess I'll have to look it up on YouTube.  That's what everyone's talking about today.  No, I didn't see the fight.  Knocked them out.  I was excited that the Mets won, too.  So, spring training is over.  Here we are with the baseball season.  Lots of excitement.  Got the Final Four coming up this weekend.  Lots of things to be talking about.  Who are you talking to?  Who are you talking to?  He's talking to the listener.  I'm hearing.  We can learn from this.  I'm hearing.  Talking to the listener.  Hold on.  I'm hearing Gator Country is starting to delete posts.  Oh, no.  Why would they do that? 
[01:01:00]  We're in phase one.  There's a real buzz going on over there.  And there's also something odd going on with the poll.  Yeah.  Never.  It reached 91%.  Right.  It's gone down slightly to 90.8%.  Right.  But Monday has gone up to a full 1%.  Someone voted.  You think never could have been the other stations in town?  Just maybe, you know.  Trying to knock out the competition.  Yeah.  Knocking out the competition.  They don't want some hot hosts like that.  Yeah, we think that's what happened.  Taking care of the spring.  The spring book.  The spring book. 
[01:01:30]  Nobody goes on vacation during the spring book.  Remember those days?  I do remember those days.  You can't do that anymore.  God, you're fucking.  You're an insider.  Yeah, when you.  You couldn't go on vacation during the spring or the fall books.  Right.  Spring and fall were the big ones.  Those were the big fucking.  Those were the big ones.  Ratings books.  Those were the big ones.  So you had to go away in winter or summer.  They're deleting cock pics.  But they're leaving up AIDS, N-word, retarded people.  Just cock pics are being deleted. 
[01:02:00]  Denny.  Well, if they're deleting cock pics, why wouldn't they get rid of Denny's picture?  Oh, now.  Because he's there.  Another good wacky stunt in radio is when you used to switch the morning hosts.  Like maybe you guys would go and host on Shade 45 and they would come in and do this show.  Whoa.  So there'd be dead air on our channel until 8 o'clock?  That's living on the line.  How does that help us?  Oh, God.  That man's got a vagina, Denny.  Denny, you like a man with a good vagina?  Not really.  And I really don't give it much thought. 
[01:02:30]  No?  No.  What about a lady with an extra part?  Again, my mind doesn't really go there at this time in the morning.  No, it's not my thing.  You don't like a good tranny?  No.  What's the matter with you?  You sure?  I remember working at a radio station with one of our sponsors was Tranny Man.  What?  Tranny Man.  It was a transmission shop.  Oh, right.  And Tranny Man.  And off the air, we would always used to say things like that.  Wouldn't say it on the air, though.  No, no, no.  Wouldn't say it on the air?  Why wouldn't you say it on the air?  No, because I don't work that way.  That's not my shit.  He doesn't work blue.  I don't work blue. 
[01:03:00]  That's not really blue, though, if someone's calling themselves Tranny Man.  That's blue.  Well, no, because he was hoping it was just a play on the word transmission, like muffler  man.  Muff.  If you wouldn't call him out and go, Tranny Man, what do you have, like a dress with  a cock under?  I worked at a station once, and we started running these commercials for Trojan Man.  And it was, you know, good times and great oldies, and you hit the button, and Trojan  Man, the phones went crazy at the radio station.  Why?  Well, because this was, I guess, you know, 15, 20 years ago, and people didn't expect  to be driving along in the car. 
[01:03:30]  With their kids.  With their kids, right?  Trojan Man.  Trojan Man.  Yeah.  People were bothered by that?  Yeah.  I was in, and I told the general manager, I said, we're not running this on my radio station.  What's going on, Sam?  Two weeks later, I got fired.  Because Trojan Man was paying the bill.  Trojan Man.  You learned.  What are you bringing to the table, you know?  Right.  You learned.  Good times and great oldies.  Probably their number one client back then.  Probably.  Hopefully it wasn't a trade, you know, where we got giveaways or something.  How many times have you been fired?  Let me see.  I got fired about five, six times.  Yeah.  There was an old school radio guy, and I think Rochester told me, you're not officially 
[01:04:00]  in radio until you've been fired.  You've heard that over the years, too.  Oh, yeah.  How can I hire this guy?  He's never been fired before.  Right.  Right.  There's something weird going on with this poll.  Yeah.  What's going on?  Why?  Well, Monday is taking off right now.  Monday has become the popular voting option.  Not, you know, not that it's winning, but never has gone down from 91 to 89.8, and now  everybody's voting Monday 1.5%.  Because the 10 people at the station right now are probably just voting over and over  again, because they need Monday to work out for their schedule. 
[01:04:30]  Right.  But, wow, they got to kind of manipulate this.  They got knocked down never.  What's the disclaimer, by the way?  I see it says disclaimer.  Oh, no.  Let's read what the disclaimer says.  I can only imagine what the disclaimer says.  It says this poll is informal, not scientific.  It only reflects the opinions of site visitors who have voluntarily participated.  The results may not represent the opinions of the public as a whole.  This site is not responsible for the statistical accuracy of opinions here expressed. 
[01:05:00]  Oh, the lawyers had to even meet a disclaimer on their dumb poll.  But don't you think people would think it's just an April Fool's stunt at this point in  time?  Well, you would think.  After a while.  Yeah, but still, they're requesting that they be taken off the air.  Right.  So, I mean, if anybody out there is listening, you have to realize that your voice needs to  be heard.  If you want to vote, it's GatorCountry1019.com.  Don't let the station manipulate the Monday thing.  Well, the thing about radio is they've always thought the listener is an idiot, and they 
[01:05:30]  treat them like that, and they think they could just pull anything over.  They're not.  Have you ever gone to one of our events, Dennis?  Oh, boy.  Have you ever listened to a phone call?  Have you?  Exactly.  Yes.  But that's the active audience.  They are idiots.  That's the active audience.  They're fucked idiots.  Those are the people.  Those are the active audience.  Oh, we love you.  Active audience.  Yeah.  There's people who would never call a radio station, who will never show up at an event, but  listen to you all the time.  Oh, I love those guys.  I mean, people like that, too.  They just, you know, they don't want to see it.  You mean the nice people? 
[01:06:00]  There are nice people out there.  There are people who listen.  Are there?  There's nice people out there that don't pick apart every single fucking word you say?  I think so.  What the hell?  It's entertaining.  How do those people hang out?  I don't want to hang with them.  Again, radio is an entertainment medium.  You guys are entertaining.  And if people don't like what you do, you turn the dial.  You know, 1010 wins on the way in.  Wasn't sure if Lindsay Lohan was pulling an April Fool's break for Dennis Falcone.  Why?  Was she not a cunt?  She tweeted, it's official.  I'm pregnant.  And the 1010 wins guy is like, well, we're not sure, but hopefully this is an April Fool's break. 
[01:06:30]  Why would 1010 report it if they don't know if it's...  Right.  They're reporting the tweet of a celebrity on a legitimate news station?  On April Fool's.  Well, sadly, the news industry has gone down to be, you know, that fluff journalism because  of all the shows like TMZ and Entertainment Tonight and things like that.  That's not news.  I feel bad that I said the C word while Denny was in the studio.  Denny doesn't go over that.  No.  No, he doesn't work blue.  I was watching TV last night, the old episodes of the Louis C.K. show. 
[01:07:00]  I wouldn't know.  I don't acknowledge that show.  And you were on that, and you lost half a person.  I mean, you look fantastic now.  Thank you.  What episode was it?  It was the one when you said a guy came in and you wanted to sell him some weed in the  bathroom, I think.  Oh, that's lucky, Louis.  Yes, his wife wanted to get pregnant.  Wow.  Oh, wow.  That's old.  That's many years ago.  Yeah, I was a fatty.  Now I'm really hot.  A little information.  You're looking good there.  You're looking good.  Coming from the Gator Country Facebook page.  Yes.  Just in case we want to know who's voting, who's not voting, there's a caption that says 
[01:07:30]  he votes never, and it's a picture of Tom Skerritt.  Tom Skerritt.  He would vote never.  He voted never.  Dallas in the Alien movie.  Oh.  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  We've never really brought him up on our show.  Not at all.  Oh, we have, though?  No.  No, not really.  Tom Skerritt.  What's with the aborted Hitler cock?  I don't know.  Some guy keeps posting pictures of titties that say aborted Hitler cock on him.  It must be a band or something.  And you mentioned Dallas.  You know, it was 1978 back on this day.  Did you guys mention that yet? 
[01:08:00]  Did you do anything about that?  We didn't ask you.  Back on this date, 1978.  Well, you said Dallas, so I just picked that.  Okay.  All right.  And Dallas debuted on TV.  Oh, how about that?  Yeah.  Look at that.  Dallas music, too.  E-Rock must have had it set up.  You're working together.  You and E-Rock are working.  Yeah, yeah.  He's fast, that guy.  We got a new morning show.  He's Johnny on the trigger there.  He runs a tight fork.  Johnny on the trigger.  I'm Johnny on the trigger.  Oh, man.  South Fork?  South Fork or North Fork?  I used to love this opening. 
[01:08:30]  E-Rock.  E-Rock gets kept me in my fork.  That's what's missing from TV these days.  They don't have good theme songs.  Theme show openings.  They don't have time.  No.  They got to get right to the show because all the commercials, Dennis Falcone.  You guys should do that one day.  Play TV themes.  Commercials?  TV themes.  TV theme day.  We just did a TV theme day.  We could do that.  Like we do with our band days.  Why don't we make it today, Dennis?  Why don't we do that?  TV theme day.  Or do rock in reverse.  That's always fun where you take a song and you play it in reverse. 
[01:09:00]  Rock in reverse.  When is that fun?  It's always fun.  When is it fun?  All right, Dennis, how about you go and do one of those and you bring it back to our show for after the break?  And we'll see how much fun it actually is.  That would be good.  All right.  Let's do that.  You'll get one for the break?  Why not?  I would absolutely like it.  What is it called again?  Rock in reverse.  You got to say it like that?  Rock in reverse.  Rock in reverse.  And do we have some prizes to make this official, Sam Roberts?  Yeah, we'll have some prizes.  All right, we'll have some prizes.  And surprises.  We have prizes and surprises. 
[01:09:30]  Can you get three really quickly?  Three rock in reverse.  Yeah, sure.  All right, we're going to do that next to Dennis Falcone.  Sal's around.  We'll give him that as a prize.  What's the website for the mobile DJing thing?  Simply DennisFalcone.com.  And I thank you very much for it.  I got a lot of nice hits on there.  Are you getting any business, though, from us?  Yeah, we're getting some prospective clients out there.  We're talking.  We're in the talking stages.  We're talking.  Well, people are getting married and they're saying, you know, what they want.  Right.  We'll be talking to them.  There's chicanery going on there.  Yeah.  What's going on? 
[01:10:00]  Why?  They're manipulating the vote now.  They're slowly bringing the never vote down.  The station's obviously aware that the voting has become out of control.  So they must be clicking their asses off down there.  Or they're just in the fucking program able to, you know, slowly.  Although they probably just took some, like, HTML poll it thing and just haven't had no idea.  Yeah, that's true.  No, I think the...  They're just clicking their asses off.  They're clicking their asses off and our guys don't give a fuck as much.  Give a fuck, guys.  Yeah, I say give a fuck for a little longer.  Oh, Southwest Florida. 
[01:10:30]  They're down in the Naples area, right?  Gator country?  It doesn't matter.  Southwest Florida.  They're down in Naples.  Fort Myers, maybe.  Fort Myers, yeah.  That's sort of Southwest over there.  That's a nice area.  Is it enough South for Southwest, you think?  I think so.  I know they got the West cover.  I know that much.  Yeah.  101.9, gator country.  Would you be happy to do that?  You wouldn't mind saying gator country if you were on the radio?  Yeah, I like that song, Amos Moses by Jerry Reed. 
[01:11:00]  Remember that one?  Amos Moses.  Amos Moses.  His father used him as alligator bait.  He lived in the swamp.  He lived in the swamp, yeah.  Sam, do you think they're doing something?  That was playing the other day.  With the polls?  Yeah.  Yeah, I mean, they're obviously, because they're deleting any sort of nudity now off the Facebook page.  They'll close the wall soon.  And so they're aware, and now they're, you know, you can see the shifts.  I think Obie's right.  They're just clicking.  They're clicking their asses off.  As much as they possibly can.  Yeah, they got four people that are at the station right now clicking their asses off.  That's the only way for them to manipulate the poll? 
[01:11:30]  I don't think so.  I don't think they know how to manipulate the poll.  Yeah, yeah.  So they just click.  They just have guys clicking.  They're just clicking their asses off.  Call the interns to get in there and start clicking.  And they all are just clicking that Monday button, right?  Because Monday's slowly going up.  No, immediately has started going up a lot.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, that's because our guys said, all right, all right, we're in.  We're in for the long haul.  Yeah, yeah.  So they're like, no, we're going to click immediately.  And never is going back up, see?  Yeah, never is.  Because they were fading out.  They're like, oh, this was fun for five minutes. 
[01:12:00]  They're like, oh, like, you know how the trick you're supposed to leave, if somebody's bullying  you, you just ignore them and eventually they get bored?  Yes.  Well, apparently nobody told that to Gator Country.  No.  No, they didn't.  Are they still voting never, our guys?  Or their guys?  Our guys are still voting never.  And their station is absolutely still just clicking away immediately.  Oh, they're going with immediately.  They started, yeah, they can't, they can't be subtle anymore, I don't think.  Okay.  They have to get the immediately numbers up because it looks like a very unpopular show. 
[01:12:30]  Right, right, right.  Because they got promos probably, you know, forcing traffic over there.  Right.  And they're seeing them.  When do you want?  Never.  You wanted them back, you got them back.  And their dumb little world, that can't be good.  Well.  You're pushing all the people to the website and it says never.  But people have spoken.  Now, we would have wanted to maybe punish them a little more for their prank.  But the people have spoken.  In record numbers, they have said never bring them back. 
[01:13:00]  This is so bad, they're going to have to, like, pull their promos.  Dennis understands when you have to pull a promo, right, Dennis?  Sure.  Sure.  Sure.  Why have you had to pull a promo?  The act canceled.  The act canceled.  Pull the promo.  Pull the promo.  The act canceled.  I remember we would be there.  The PD would march down the hall and go, oh, my God, pull the promo.  Molly Hatchett canceled.  Right out of there, yeah.  You can't do it.  I remember we were doing a concert once and they were calling for, like, hurricanes that  weekend.  And the general manager said, you know, just downplay that in the weather forecast.  Uh-huh.  You can't.  We can't be sending people to a park, an open area. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, yeah.  Because he didn't buy the insurance for the.  There's just all this stuff.  Because if you have a concert, it rains out or you get the insurance or you don't lose  all the money.  Oh, my God.  He didn't buy the insurance?  Of course not.  So he told you to downplay the hurricane?  No, yeah.  Don't mention it.  You can't mention it.  The weather, you know, it's coming across the.  And we're the official Weather Channel radio station.  So when people click on the Weather Channel on TV, it would go to TV and they'd say,  you know, hurricanes for Nassau-Suffolk this weekend.  They actually try to downplay the hurricane.  I completely believe this shit. 
[01:14:00]  Oh, totally.  Grassroots are going to be there.  You should do.  Also, you know, we'll be there Saturday.  You're sitting there like, holy fuck, I'm sending people into a hurricane.  Yeah, you know, Jim Cantore is going to be out there in the middle of the field, you  know, going, today there was supposed to be a rock and roll concert here.  What finally happened?  It rained.  It rained and, you know, there was.  Maybe the PD was right.  Yeah.  Maybe the hurricane wasn't such a hurricane.  No, it rained and then we had to cancel the show.  Was the radio station smart enough to play a little like you, rock you like a hurricane?  We'll do a couple of three in a row. 
[01:14:30]  Even though the show won't go on, we'll play the songs from those acts.  We didn't play rock you like a hurricane.  I was working on.  No.  That would be a little too edgy, right?  Yeah.  A little too edgy?  Yeah.  We didn't play scorpions.  How about riding the storm out?  Little R.O., would that be an appropriate song if a hurricane is buried down on the area?  That was really before the big breakthrough album, High Infidelity.  High Infidelity, right.  1981.  Keep on loving you.  Good song.  Yeah, that's a good one.  It's a good song.  Keep on loving you.  That's what we call a power ballad.  Do you remember what acts were supposed to be there that day? 
[01:15:00]  All right.  All right.  I think we had the grassroots were one of the acts, Bobby Rydell, maybe Randy and the Rainbows.  It was a potpourri.  It was a top 40 station.  Oldies, oldies.  Oldies.  Oldies station.  That did the concert thing?  Yeah.  We did summer concerts.  Free summer concerts.  Were you one of those guys that wore the station logo?  I love station stuff like that.  I love that stuff.  You do?  Yeah.  Satin jackets.  Remember satin jackets?  You loved all that?  I love all that stuff. 
[01:15:30]  With the radio logo.  T-shirts, yeah.  What's the rarest one you own or the coolest one you own?  The one I'd always like to have is a WMCA Good Guy sweatshirt.  That was the greatest promotion.  Can we get you one on eBay for you?  No, we'll have to see if there's one out there.  That's the least we could do.  Get you a WMCA Good Guy sweatshirt.  It was the yellow sweatshirt with the smile.  You want that?  Good guys.  Let's get Dennis one of those.  Those are good stuff.  WMCA Good Guys.  All right, let's try to get you one of those.  That was the name of the DJs, the good guys.  You'd wear the good guys.  What's that?  You'd wear that.  I'd hang it up in my radio room in my house. 
[01:16:00]  You got a radio?  Oh, no.  Oh, sure.  I don't know why.  There's a toilet in it.  Get out.  Get out of here.  It costs like 50 bucks.  It's ridiculous.  We're not doing that.  No, spend your money on good things.  You should spend it on bumper stickers or koozies or something.  Well, to a collector.  How old is that?  That's back to the mid-60s.  Wait, if this is your thing, why wouldn't you spend 50 bucks on a sweatshirt?  Why are you making us do it?  No, no, no.  Because it's cool to get this hat for free.  Right.  It's good to buy it.  It's like, yeah.  Right.  Do you want to collect it?  I also hear that he has a bumper sticker collection.  Is that true? 
[01:16:30]  I love the bumper stickers.  Yeah?  Yeah, I used to call up the bumper sticker companies and, yeah, we're thinking of putting  together a campaign.  Can you send me some samples?  Kind of smart.  What a psycho.  That's kind of smart.  You know, I'm going back to, you know, when AM stations played music and, you know.  So which ones do you have?  You got a wow sticker?  I got like three shoe boxes full of them at home.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I got a wow sticker.  What's a hard one to get that you have?  A hard one to get?  The old WABC music note.  The music's on us.  That was a great sticker. 
[01:17:00]  I have the WNBC's going to make me rich sticker.  Oh, wow.  I got them all.  I got them all.  I do remember that one.  I get this one from Texas called Long Neck Country.  It's, you know, like a long neck beer bottle.  Yeah.  You probably couldn't get away with that these days.  There was another WNBC one bumper sticker back in the days when Imus was there and Howard.  With the Sprite?  WNBC.  Might have been.  Yeah, yeah.  WNBC.  Wow.  WNBC's going to make me rich.  Yeah, I remember the WNBC's going to make me rich commercial.  Oh, God.  But, yeah, the Coke, they had a... 
[01:17:30]  If we weren't so bad, we wouldn't be so good.  Yeah, that one I remember.  If we weren't so bad, we wouldn't be so good.  We wouldn't be so good.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I worked at that station.  Man, man, man, man, man, man, man, man.  What station you worked for?  I worked at the mighty 1290 WGLI, Long Island's number one oldie station.  Why do you say it that way?  Coming up on 731, 21, 29 before 8 o'clock.  Get a move on.  Take the umbrella.  Might get a drizzle later on this afternoon.  Take the umbrella.  Might get a drizzle. 
[01:18:00]  Do you like when radio stations do the fugitive bit?  Hey, look, there's a window cling.  You want to talk about a...  Hold on.  Go back.  You didn't even notice that, Sam Roberts.  That's the famous window cling.  Wow.  What site is that on?  eBay.  What are they selling it for?  $22.49.  It's a window cling.  That is a rare sticker.  Look at that piece of shit.  They didn't stay on the windows.  You couldn't put them anywhere. 
[01:18:30]  He was all about people don't put stickers on their bumpers anymore, so let's do the window cling.  It's a window cling.  There's a whole collection of them there.  Look at that.  There's somebody who probably has them all.  In their radio room.  In the basement.  Hey, you are.  Right next to the 8-tracks and cassettes.  Not only do I not have a radio room, if you walked through my apartment, you wouldn't  even know I was in radio.  Right.  There's nothing hanging up at this point.  This is not even a real radio room.  Not one fucking thing.  Yeah, I know.  We should at least fucking dress this place up a little nicer, right? 
[01:19:00]  Like you don't wear sweatshirts?  Would you say, you know, Owen Anthony?  You know, O'Brien Anthony or something?  I used to.  I used to when I was in Rochester.  I used to wear the WCMF sweatshirt.  I was pretty proud to wear that for a while.  So, I don't think we ever wore AAF stuff.  I did.  No, you know what?  I think I did, too.  I had the big jacket.  I had a big, like, winter coat with the big WAF on the back.  Oh, would I wear the shit out of that?  But in all fairness, back then you didn't have a winter coat.  Oh, that's true.  I'm thinking how much I want to wear one of those.  And you don't wear the stuff after you get fired from the place. 
[01:19:30]  That's ridiculous.  I got fired from a station and came back to clean out my office and I brought all my jacket  and sweatshirts and hats.  I just threw them in the middle of the floor.  Oh, that's great.  Take this job and shove it.  Right.  I'm not going to be wearing this stuff.  And there was another kid at the station.  What happened to that station?  Did you get them?  What's that?  They changed formats or something by now, right?  No, they're still there.  They're doing pretty good.  They're still kicking ass.  They didn't give a fucking pile of clothes.  All right, let them go.  There was another guy by the name of Dennis.  He goes, do you mind if I have the jacket?  It's because that's my name also.  Yeah.  He said that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  On Long Island, the BAB sticker was very, very popular. 
[01:20:00]  Many, many cars on the expressway and parkways you'd see with the BAB sticker.  Well, they said I want to wear the yellow sweatshirt that Denny wants so bad that I want to come in with that and then have somebody throw beet juice on me.  Let's do that.  No, I wouldn't even wear it.  I would just keep it in a plastic bag.  Even if it had beet juice on it?  I'd try to wash it.  That's from the 60s, that sweatshirt?  Yeah, it goes back to the 60s.  Good guy sweatshirt.  It was a hot promotion in New York.  Wow.  Also, the PLJ stickers were very big. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah, they used to.  The little album rock stations.  What size are you?  Oval ones.  Medium, yeah.  Medium, large.  I've also considerably lost some weight, too, because summer season's coming.  Going to be on the beach.  Rocking the docks.  Causing a commotion by the ocean.  It's a station that reaches the beaches.  What about rocking the bays or rocking between the bays or something?  It doesn't rhyme.  I know.  It doesn't rhyme.  But there's a rhyme to that.  I forget.  I'm trying to remember. 
[01:21:00]  Oh, is that fucking great.  Rocking the docks.  Rocking the docks.  Yeah, rocking the docks.  That's the down-the-shore places?  Yeah, causing a commotion by the ocean.  What commotion would they cause?  What kind of commotion were you causing?  Yeah.  You just say that.  It's just hype.  You know what that is?  A tsunami is a commotion by the ocean.  Exactly.  When you see all those houses and people getting fucking plowed up.  Yeah.  What would you do to cause a commotion by the ocean?  You just say it.  It just sounds slick.  That's it.  Ah.  It just sounds boss.  What would you play after you said that?  Causing a commotion by the ocean.  Madonna.  Causing a commotion. 
[01:21:30]  But you wouldn't play Madonna.  That was a good song.  Well, I'm going to say it now because now it's an oldie.  Yeah, I understand.  But when you actually had to say that.  Because it may be Born to be Wild.  Oh, wow.  All right.  All right.  Something that's got a real rocket intro.  Or Raspberries Go All the Way.  I remember the Raspberries.  It's a great song.  That's a great song.  I don't know that one.  Well, we'll play that to break.  And we're going to do your little radio bit after the break, too.  Yeah, we'll get a hold of my radio pal, Sal, and put that together.  Rock and Reverse.  What is that?  Rock and Reverse.  We're playing that next for some real prizes.  Oh, yeah.  Can you find real shit, though, Sam? 
[01:22:00]  Stuff that people would care about.  Yeah, I got some great prizes.  All right.  You got the Raspberries.  No, I don't see it.  Who's it by?  The Raspberries is the group.  Go all the way.  He's spelling it wrong.  R-A-Z.  Raspberries.  I think he didn't know either one.  Group out of Cleveland.  I think that was a cover right there.  Eric Carman, the lead singer of the group.  I think he wasn't listening at all.  I don't think he listened at all.  E-Rock, were you listening?  I was, but I thought it was the title of the song.  Okay.  Go all the way.  Eric Carman, not Cartman.  Eric Carman later went on to perform.  What song was that? 
[01:22:30]  He had Never Gonna Fall in Love Again.  He also had Hungry Eyes from the Dirty Dancing soundtrack.  Hungry Eyes.  That was a huge hit for him.  That was the same guy, huh?  It just always drives me crazy when they have a movie that's set in the 1960s, and the music  is contemporary music.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  As they're doing with the new 42, Jackie Robinson movie?  Yeah.  Jay-Z song is in the movie.  That's ridiculous.  Yeah, there was plenty of songs that they could have played.  I got some issues with that Jackie Robinson movie, by the way.  You might want to wait before you bring your issues forward. 
[01:23:00]  Why do you have issues with it?  Well, I don't think it's very accurate as far as his attitude, and, you know.  What do you mean?  I'm not seeing, I'm not thinking he was mouthing off to people back then.  I don't think there was much mouthing off.  I think they're glorifying it a little bit?  On his part.  Yeah, they got to make him look like, you know, a tough guy, when meanwhile he probably  fucking opened his eyes real wide, looked, nodded yes a lot, and fucking got out on  the field. 
[01:23:30]  I hate when they take these characters, black characters in movies, and make them look like  and act like they would today.  When meanwhile, you know, history's history.  It was pretty fucking brutal if you got a little lippy with white people back in what  I call the day.  But what was his attitude?  I don't know anything about Jackie Robinson.  Oh, there's somebody who's seeing him like lunging forward going, yeah, I'll tell you what!  And it's like, no, he wasn't saying that.  No, what was his real attitude, though, in real life?  Was he like that?  Sure, he was very fucking quiet and thankful to be there and be breathing the next day. 
[01:24:00]  Well, they did the same.  When people wanted to fucking kill him.  They did the same thing in the movie 61, the Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle movie.  Right, right.  Nobody threw a chair on the field.  Oh, stop.  You know, if somebody threw a chair, their security would have thrown him out.  Well, thank you.  You know, they just did that.  They did that with other movies like fucking, you know, the updated Red Tails, I guess it  was, the black Tuskegee Airmen or something, and it's like, yeah, take that, Hitler!  No!  No one said that?  Stop it!  Tuskegee University.  No one was fucking, yeah, I'm gonna gank your ass, Hitler! 
[01:24:30]  Is that real?  Ah, it was just...  Was it like that in the movie?  I didn't see that.  Yes.  No, it's funny.  You don't think pilots talk that way?  No!  And then when they fucking, like, anytime you get a bunch of black cowboys in those black  cowboy type movies, where they cast like...  Oh, you didn't know what to say there.  You're used to saying something else.  No, no, I knew what to say.  Black cowboys.  Okay, alright.  In the black cowboy movies, where they cast, like, you know, rappers from the fucking 90s  or something, and they decide to make it that, and they're riding like, yeah, it's the wild, 
[01:25:00]  wild west!  Yeah, the wild, wild west!  They also didn't have giant mechanical spiders in the wild west.  Look, that was pretty fucking cool.  That was cool.  That was pretty fucking cool, that mechanical spider.  Gotta agree with that.  How about Tuskegee University, where the Commodores got together, met at a talent show, and then  they just signed with Motel, and the hits just kept on coming.  Coming.  I fucking love it!  He has trivia about everything.  Well, that's how he makes his living.  Brilliant.  You know, a good oldies listener loves trivia, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[01:25:30]  You gotta say the things between the songs.  You wanna ramp up the raspberries?  We'll play a little piece of this going on a break.  A little raspberries for you.  Alright.  It's dennisfalcone.com, everyone.  Oh, yeah.  Hire him for some dumb fucking event.  How about a nice event?  Stick around through the break for rock and reverse.  Did you find the raspberries yet?  It's a great one.  And I always just say, this is not the Mellow Station.  Let's rock and roll.  It's the raspberries.  Eric Carman and the guys.  1972.  Give it to me!  It's a great one, isn't it?  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're getting lazy. 
[01:26:00]  No, that was good.  What happened to the Ram?  No, no.  Because you get that post.  You get that give it to me, and they hit that guitar thing in there.  That's what you were going for?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You got two of them.  He was right there.  I wasn't sure if you were going for the vocals there.  Give it to me again.  Hit it again.  Oh, oh, oh.  Oh, it sounded so good in 1972.  It sounds even better today in quadraphonic sound.  I don't know.  Kissed it.  I don't know.  It's a kiss.  It's called a kiss?  It's a kiss.  We just kiss it like that.  You kiss it.  That's the excuse for fucking it up. 
[01:26:30]  There you go.  Give it a kiss.  Or just say, get down.  If you didn't have anything to say.  Do you do double ramps?  Double ramps?  No, once the guy starts talking.  No, no.  A double ramp meaning you hit maybe the guitar.  Oh, you could.  And then you got something else to say before the vocals.  A post.  Yeah.  But never talk after the vocal.  No, we understand that.  Who does a double ramp?  Like, who is really good at a double ramp?  Yeah.  There has to be double ramp guys.  Yeah, you could have, if the song has a couple of double ramps, like 25 or 6 to 4, Chicago.  Yeah.  Because it's got so many of them. 
[01:27:00]  You could do a PSA.  Who's the best at hitting?  Who's the best at hitting the board?  I'm sure Chicago appreciated that you did a PSA to the intro of 25 or 6 to 4.  I'm sure they really appreciated that.  Off the top of my head.  Basically saying the instrumental is nonsense.  When they were in the studio recording that, it's like, this is the part they'll just talk over.  Look, I spent a few years talking over music, and I always felt guilty.  I'm like, I don't think the band really wants me doing a fucking PSA for where the station's going to be this week. 
[01:27:30]  A community bulletin board.  A community bulletin board.  You got 16 seconds there, man.  You could do the weather.  Yeah, but to the fucking band that recorded it, it's sacred to them.  Right.  Every second.  Well, even Brickhouse has got some nice intros in it, because you've got a couple of oohs and grunts in there.  Ow.  Yeah.  Brick.  Ow.  Commodores.  Marky, Marky.  There you go.  That packs the dance floor.  It does.  It's one of your go-tos, right?  Woo, woo, yeah.  So sick of that song.  We'll play that funky music.  You don't like Brickhouse?  I do, but enough with it already.  I've heard it enough. 
[01:28:00]  Marky, Marky.  All right.  Raspberries again.  I'm going to do Raspberries one more time here.  Well, we're going to play it out.  We're going to play a little bit of it.  We've got to play it out.  Because everyone's saying how great this song is today.  It's a great song from 1972.  It's the Raspberries.  Eric Carman on the lead vocal.  It's the Raspberries.  Yeah.  guitar solo 
[01:28:30]  guitar solo 
[01:29:00]  And I want you to say  Just in this way I love you so  Please go all the way  It feels so right 
[01:29:30]  Being with you here tonight  Please go all the way  Just hold me close  Don't let me go  For her love  I was true than me 
[01:30:00]  Where my heart is  Where my heart is going to be  But now I've changed  It feels so strange  Don't let me know what you know  Almost needs to be  And she says  Come on  Come on  Come on  Come on  Come on  I need you  Come on  I need you  Come on  Come on  Baby's gone 
[01:30:30]  Baby's gone  All the way  It feels so right  It feels so right  Being with you here tonight  Baby's gone  All the way  Just hold me close  Don't ever let me go 
[01:31:00]  You're listening to the  You're listening to the

[01:36:30]  For me, there's a new girl in town, and she's looking good.  There's a fresh, freckled face in the middle of the night.  And there's a new girl in town, with a brand new style.  Listen up into it, cheers.  Here comes the jazz part. 
[01:37:00]  I love this part.  Oh, strap back.  TV show theme day.  Why do you like that part?  It's good.  It's a good song.  It's terrible.  Before we get back to Dennis Falcone, I know you're ready to go, which is pretty amazing.  It's so weird to see someone that, like, fucking is very well prepared.  Well, having Sal alone, that guy's great.  He was in there getting the whole music to get on.  You just lost half your fan base.  You just lost half your fan base. 
[01:37:30]  He's a good production assistant.  He took directions very well.  Because I got a tweet from a guy that said, just try to call to play Rock and Reverse with  Dennis Falcone, and Sal just said no and hung up on me.  What?  We've got to talk to him about his customer service skills.  Sal, is that true?  Well, one, Sal wasn't on the phone, and two, I don't think that happened, because we have  a bunch of people on the phones right now.  Damn it.  I thought I finally had Sal.  Sal's good, man.  All right.  We've got to show Jimmy a video.  Yes.  And I also want to just say to the fucking mainstream press, stop making believe that Obama knows 
[01:38:00]  how to play basketball.  Oh, please.  I've been onto this for years.  Embarrassing.  For years, yes, because they always talk about he knows how to play basketball.  They show him shooting hoops every once in a while.  When he goes back to Chicago for a little rest there, they have a story how he went to  the local gym with his old pals to play basketball, basketball, basketball.  He stinks.  Yeah.  Anyone that has spent any time on the court knows that. 
[01:38:30]  Will you stop?  Well, they...  And obviously the video that's pretty much everywhere today proves that.  But they have enough video before today that shows that he sucks at basketball.  Yeah.  He went, what?  He shot 18 in a row that missed.  Wow.  From 15...  Have you seen the video?  It's so fucking embarrassing.  He did a pathetic layup.  And then he went for the layup and he missed that horribly.  And then he finally did kind of like a girl layup.  Sorry to the girls out there.  To finally make a basket. 
[01:39:00]  Yeah.  Watch this, Jimmy.  No full screen.  What happened?  Where is he playing with all his people?  It's like the Easter egg roll yesterday, I think.  And they got them all on the basketball court.  Because, you know, Obama knows how to play basketball, everyone.  Of course.  He even got a basketball hoop at the White House.  That's one.  Yeah.  Look at him.  Watch.  They're just bricks.  There's no touch.  He just misses every shot.  There's a better video where it's just one after another. 
[01:39:30]  He just got it.  All right, here he's fine.  I think this is finally the streak.  Watch.  He's all, like, cocky.  Like, watch what I can do.  Watch.  Brick.  He missed.  He couldn't even roll out.  This is a longer version of the video we saw this morning. 
[01:40:00]  You suck.  I would just be staring at the president the whole time.  Like, there's people actually playing.  I know.  Like, how are you shooting?  Just stare at him.  When you make sure your ball went right next to him every time.  Oh, excuse me, Mr. President.  Right.  Just keep chasing down your basket.  Would you have a camera out?  Oh, fuck.  You want a picture?  I'd be the worst.  Now, there's a better video where they show him miss 18 in a row.  18 in a row.  That's almost impossible.  There it is.  They're showing it right now on MSNBC.  Yeah, there's one. 
[01:40:30]  God, they read our mind.  Just over and over again.  Like, a lot of these aren't even close.  He's good for him, too.  No, he doesn't.  No?  I think it looks good.  No, not at all, to be honest with you.  That was good for him.  Just one after another.  And then look at this horrible lamp.  He misses that.  And then here's the girl lamp.  Finally made it. 
[01:41:00]  Good morning.  It's 8 o'clock on the East Coast.  5 a.m.  So it's time for everyone to stop saying the president is a good basketball player.  He never was a good basketball player.  He's terrible.  You don't think that the NBA players go full force against him when they play him?  Yeah, right.  They know he can't fucking actually play, which is embarrassing.  What are they going to do?  I guess it's...  Oh, we have to show Jimmy a video.  By the way, can I tell you how funny this is?  We're going to go back to you, Desmond.  I think it's hilarious that it made you mad.  Can they stop? 
[01:41:30]  Because it's frustrating.  He can't play basketball.  Because it's frustrating because he can't.  What?  Oh, he's a black president so he can play basketball?  No, he's a fucking nerd.  We've all noticed that.  He has no fucking rhythm whatsoever, and he doesn't play basketball well.  I think that's been proven.  He doesn't do anything well.  I like him, though.  Do you?  I know you hate him.  Yeah, I really do.  I do like...  I don't like his tax shit.  I like...  Hey, stop showing this. 
[01:42:00]  Everyone, that's three misses.  This is not fair.  Stop it.  Four misses.  And by the way, give the guy respect.  Here we go.  Watch.  I mean, he keeps shooting from outside, right?  Sure.  No fear.  He knows the cameras are on him.  Come on.  You know what?  There are a lot of guys, again.  They can't even admit that he sucks at basketball?  It's MSNBC.  They can't admit he sucks at anything.  They get the cameras around the world.  He's a magic, magic man.  He's a magic man.  By all accounts, the president has a game.  He's good.  That was just like, as you said, in an off moment. 
[01:42:30]  I will bet a million fucking dollars you can put every camera on me  and give me that same shot.  I'm going to make one out of 18.  I'll take it.  I'll fucking put a million dollars on the line.  He stinks.  I'll bet you kiss.  It wasn't even that far away.  I don't know why I'm so annoyed by this.  That's a nice game.  I grew up playing basketball.  That's why.  So I know when a guy isn't good at the sport.  That's a nice game to play at events.  You go out with a little basketball thing.  And you let the kid shoot.  And now they're showing him as a really bad bowler as well. 
[01:43:00]  You forgot about that, remember?  He's a nerd.  Gutter ball.  And he walks like he's this athlete president.  He's not.  He stinks.  Although I kind of.  What?  He's not a good basketball player.  No, no, no.  But I kind of like the fact that he's not.  I don't want a president who's good at that shit.  Oh, true.  But he will tell everyone he's an athlete.  And he knows how to play these sports and activities. 
[01:43:30]  Because bowling isn't a sport.  Eh, it's a sport.  I was watching, believe it or not, some bowling Easter Sunday.  There was some bowling on the TV at my aunt and uncle's house.  That's a dork.  Well, it was on the TV.  Oh, it wasn't we?  No, no, no.  It was actual bowling.  Holy fuck.  And I was noticing.  I don't know who this guy is.  And perhaps somebody would know.  So, he's got this fucking throw that you can't even believe it.  He holds the ball with two hands pretty much until he releases.  Right.  He releases it right on, like, his left side gutter. 
[01:44:00]  It's right on the fucking gutter.  It swings all the way to the right.  And it comes, bam, right back.  It comes back?  Dude.  Dude.  Wait, it's crazy.  Hold on.  It starts out left.  Is that the guy?  It goes all the way right and then comes back left?  Jason Belm.  And that wasn't even a great example.  What the fuck was that?  He has two hands.  Check this fucking guy out. 
[01:44:30]  Is he one of the best on the...  I don't know.  He was killing.  On the tour or whatever?  He was killing.  Really?  Yeah.  It's really fucked up.  Check this throw out.  That's weird.  That's his style, huh?  Yeah.  He releases it so close to the gutter.  This is an old clip of him, I guess.  That Jason starts right here.  That's right.  Did I have a stroke?  Look at this.  That's different. 
[01:45:00]  That's different.  Oh, Sam, find something from like last week.  Sam.  Sam, find like a new clip.  Bowling fucking place, man.  Get a new clip.  Yeah, come on, you shite heap.  Put 20 fucking...  Put his name and then 2013 or something.  2013?  2013.  Yeah.  You know, that's the year or something.  I thought he did better in 2012 myself.  There it is.  What?  No?  Come on.  Why can't you ever find anything?  Time for the Geico Championship recap.  Randy, Lon, Tommy Jones back to the big show. 
[01:45:30]  Oh.  You know what?  I'm not talking the entire time, but to watch a little bit of bowling, it's not that bad.  And then now they're all extremed out like every sport.  They're fucking...  They're wearing like...  Yeah, that's him.  He looks like a NASCAR driver.  I know, dude.  Look at their shirts now.  What the fuck?  All their shirts got like logos and fucking shit on them.  If you didn't know any better, you thought it was the NASCAR guys.  They're wearing sunglasses.  Right.  Dude, look at that throw.  That's him?  No.  It's another guy. 
[01:46:00]  But it's like...  It's all about the spin, huh?  Look, look.  It's like NASCAR.  You're right.  That's going to hurt your wrist after a while.  Where's the guy?  They're not showing the guy.  You think they...  Oh, here's the guy.  Watch.  Watch this fucking throw.  All right.  Two hands.  Oh, you're right.  Right on the gutter.  It goes out and then slams back in at like a million miles an hour.  But it doesn't start coming back until the last like two, three feet.  Looks like Donnie Wicklin.  Donnie!  Yes, he does.  Without the affinity for other gentlemen. 
[01:46:30]  Different balls in his hands.  That's right.  And you know what the gutter is.  The balls just kind of roll around the outside of the asshole and then dip right in.  His filthy gutter.  His asshole's a cum gutter.  All right.  Here he goes again.  Look at this guy.  It's great.  Two hands pretty much to the end and then it starts spitting the last like three feet.  Right.  That's fucked up.  It gets a bite like right before.  Yeah, I was watching that. 
[01:47:00]  Fair enough.  And then I'm realizing like bowling is becoming like this sport where it's like not just dorky.  Right.  Like they're wearing cool shirts with all the colors and logos and sponsors.  Right.  By the way, Dennis, we're trying to keep the audience right here.  Yeah.  So we're teasing your bit a little bit.  There you go.  We're trying to keep them listening a little longer.  Earl Anthony wouldn't be wearing stuff like that.  No.  No, he doesn't work like that.  Earl Anthony.  The buzz cut.  Buzz cut and just a very plain shirt.  Look at this guy.  He's wearing fucking, he's playing with sunglasses inside. 
[01:47:30]  He looks like Dale Earnhardt.  It's crazy.  Right.  Look at him.  It's Daryl Waltrip.  Yeah.  They're all dressed all sporty now.  Like bowling's a real sport.  Boogity, boogity, boogity.  Let's go bowling.  Why would he say that?  He says that about the NASCAR thing.  Who does?  Waltrip, doesn't he say that?  Boogity, boogity, boogity.  Let's go racing.  Yeah.  The NASCAR guy says that.  Can I get the sunglasses on while he's bowling?  Right.  He was just reworking his NASCAR.  Look at him.  How silly. 
[01:48:00]  Saying.  Pretty cool.  Can we show Jimmy the viral video for today?  And then we're going to move on to the Dennis Falcone bit.  It's the gentleman.  Maybe we'll try to keep the audience through the commercial break.  Try to push him into the next quarter hour.  Push him into the next quarter hour.  It's all about pushing him into quarter hours.  Right.  Right.  Quarter hours.  You want those quarter hours.  That's what you're doing.  That's what you're doing.  Build up that TSL.  Time spent.  Yes, of course.  It's the video of the gentleman that snatched someone's purse. 
[01:48:30]  Yes.  And then ran into a window.  I didn't realize he ran as far as he did.  Because they were showing a shorter clip where it was just the impact.  Oh.  And then I finally saw the long clip where he was running for a while.  It's fantastic.  It really is great.  He fucking.  If you can find the news report, because it's in Australia.  It's pretty funny.  Is that where it was?  How they report it.  Australia.  Oh, no, Sam. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, Sam.  Oh, Sam.  Purse snatch window.  I don't know.  Purse window.  I don't think so.  Oh, there he is.  That's the guy.  Is this the new story?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, where's the video?  Oh.  That's a real estate site.  That is.  How about down one where.  Bode in the viral video.  Downs one, since he's doing it.  Right there where it's, see the plate.  There it is.  Yeah.  Yeah, there it is. 
[01:49:30]  Uno.  Dos.  They took us through the biggest.  That's vice.  That's vice, yeah.  Okay.  Guys, walking through with the woman he's following.  Then he grabs her purse.  And he runs.  And he's taken off.  And he's gone.  And there he is.  And he watches it.  Bam.  Knocked the fuck out.  He ran into the wrong side of the door.  He knocked the glass.  And then he gets away because he has an accomplice out there.  Yeah, the accomplice is right there.  And then you got the tattoo guy. 
[01:50:00]  The guy that owns the tattoo parlor next door.  Yeah, and he's dragging him off.  He was trying to grab him back.  But then there's a threat.  And then the tattoo guy backed off and they got away.  Oh, is he fucked up?  He hit that window full speed.  Full run with his face.  And got knocked the fuck out.  And there they go.  They're looking for them.  Oh, yeah?  G'day.  Wow.  Today, a purse snitcher hit a window.  Fill on his face. 
[01:50:30]  Could have played Heart of Glass, Blondie.  I ran so far away, Flock of Seagulls.  There's always a song.  So we could do a O&A three in a row is the way to go.  You get three songs.  Are those blocks?  We get three songs in it.  It's always good to do three.  Especially when you guys do a lot of appearances.  They said that a block was three songs.  Yeah.  The fuck is that about?  And we did the four-play weekend where the fourth cut is always live.  Double shot.  The last Tuesday.  What's wrong with you?  A double shot.  We're in two.  Baseball. 
[01:51:00]  Baseball's back.  Double shots.  Double plays.  Home run.  Four in a row.  Way to go.  You think a lot of oldie stations are breaking out their baseball material right now?  Oh, yeah.  Probably have the World Series weekend.  World Series abroad.  Yeah.  Wow.  You repeat it.  You do the opening day, weekend, and then you do the same thing.  Did you ever do a Firecracker 500?  Do the countdown.  Yeah.  That's 4th of July, right?  Yeah.  That's a big one.  Firecracker 500.  Right.  Kick it off on July 3rd, Friday, usually 5 o'clock in the afternoon of the weekend. 
[01:51:30]  And you can soak that thing all the way through.  Go on to the website.  Download the list of the songs so you can keep score.  Keep score.  Holy shit.  And then you do things like, you know, there were 10 Motown acts in the countdown.  You give the statistics.  Elvis had five songs.  And let's see if the number one song will be the same one as last year.  Stairway to heaven.  There was always stairway to heaven.  Then a PD got brave and kind of made stairway to heaven second and made Freebird first. 
[01:52:00]  And then there was a lot of outrage.  That's crazy.  That got people talking like, holy crap.  Wow.  Stairway to heaven was two this year.  And then the production.  And now the number one.  Oh, it was huge.  The number one.  And coming up right after this break, the number one song.  But it's always good to say you can have a say in the music we play.  Vote now.  What song will be number one?  Would those votes really count?  A say in the music we play.  Your vote does count.  Yes.  Why did everything have to rhyme, Denny? 
[01:52:30]  It's just fun.  It's just made for good radio.  What's fun about that?  It's fun.  Everything got a rhyme.  I'm having a ball doing it.  Everything got a rhyme.  It's great.  All right.  I want you to tell the people that requesting a song on the radio is bullshit.  You know it.  Well, if it's part of the format.  You know, I mean, you can't request something.  You know, people used to do that all the time.  Could you play Jim Crimson?  I would have a playlist.  Jim Crimson?  We don't.  That's not really part of the format.  I would have a playlist.  I would have a playlist, and then, you know, you'd take phone calls, and then, and like,  oh, I just happened to be playing Sweet Child of Mine. 
[01:53:00]  Here you go.  I could fucking send this out to that guy.  Yeah.  Well, let me tell you what I got coming up.  I have this, this, and that.  Could you, you know, really, they just want to hear their name, and they want to hear,  you know, people love hearing their name on the radio.  It makes them feel good.  I would look at a map in Rochester, I'd pick some just random fucking towns, and then I  would pick some random names, and I would put them together, and make believe everybody  was requesting songs all over the goddamn place.  Oh, really?  That's smart.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Do that?  Well, Opie.  You would do the laundry list.  Every song went out to somebody back then.  Well, Opie, I remember something called the Opie Nighttime Attitude. 
[01:53:30]  Opie's Nighttime Attitude on BAB.  It's time for the all-request and dedication hour, where nothing was requested.  It was complete bullshit.  But I got an hour to play the Request of the People, Dennis Falcone.  You know, I have a show on the Boneyard where I play music, and if I'm riding around,  and I hear the Boneyard, and they say, yeah, yeah, we have the Jim Norton, I really do  get thrilled hearing my name on the radio.  Oh, Jimmy.  Of course.  You really do.  It's awesome.  That's me! 
[01:54:00]  But you're on now.  I know.  So you're on the radio now.  It's not the awful content I put out, but he's right.  There's something about, it's like you hear it on the radio, and you're like,  Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Norton.  Yay!  I'm sorry.  He needs a jingle.  He needs his name sung.  Oh, yeah.  I do.  How would it go?  Jim Norton.  Oh.  You want people to make Jim Norton jingles?  He should have been like Slim Jim Norton.  Big Jim.  Oh, well, he's Slim Jim now.  Slim Jim Norton.  Yeah.  I had a jingle, but nobody liked it.  What was it?  Hey! 
[01:54:30]  Jim Norton!  Jim Norton!  You've got to get it produced by the big jingle companies in Dallas.  In Dallas?  He knows where the big jingle companies are.  Are they the ones that do all the good?  The big jingle warehouses?  Professional jingles?  Yeah, there's Jam Jingles in Dallas.  Yeah.  Good old Jonathan Wolfert.  John, been producing jingles.  Do they have samples online?  You probably get their samples.  I have a lot of their samples at home.  Oh, of course.  At home.  In the radio room. 
[01:55:00]  We learned about the radio room today.  Let's hear some jingles.  Yeah.  Got some samples?  There should be jingles on there.  Yeah.  Let's hear some.  This is what your radio station could have?  You could buy these for yourself, I guess, too.  People do that.  They buy their own jingles, you know, with their own names and that stuff.  Yeah.  And then what do they do with it?  Regular people do that?  So when your phone goes off, your name, you know, Jim Norton!  I've got a call coming in.  How come we're not getting jingles?  That sounds terrible.  I'm sure we're...  He just sang for that, you know. 
[01:55:30]  Dennis Falcone sang for that.  You like that first cup of the morning thing, huh?  That's nice.  It's nice.  It's for a contemporary radio station.  Wait, is that...  How much do they charge for this?  Well, it depends on the market size.  Oh.  But they might have an individual price.  Here's what's happening at the mix. 
[01:56:00]  Hi, this is Ron Harrell, Program Director at KIMN, Mix 100.3.  We play Denver's Best Mix, and we hear what it sounds like.  After all, the sound is the fun part.  What we all got into radio for, remember?  Wow, that sounds like Dennis.  Well, we always sound great with jingles from Jam.  They're musical, memorable, and they work.  I think you'll enjoy this collection of sweet jingles,  day part elements, and sounders.  Jam calls it.  The best mix in Denver, Mix 100.3. 
[01:56:30]  It's absolutely hideous.  Oh, and that PD.  Hey, we're flank.  This is nice.  It's not.  It's fucking terrible.  That's a great name for a radio station.  Nice.  It's always nice.  It's hokey.  A new radio station.  It's hokey.  You could listen to these things all day.  You could listen to these all day?  Yeah, but I'm on a cassette and just, you know, walk around with the Walkman on, playing these things.  No, you don't.  Playing jingles. 
[01:57:00]  Yeah, I used to do that.  You would?  I don't believe it.  You couldn't have done that.  I love doing that.  Singing the jingles and everything.  Singing the jingles.  It's part of the fabric.  What do you rock?  Remember Denny said last time he used to have jingle parties on Friday nights?  I used to get to radio stations.  Yeah, I'd rather have an 11 party on a Friday night.  Because guys would trade.  Hey, I got the new one in from Chicago.  The Chicago Fire Package.  You want to hear it?  Yeah, great.  All right, 7 o'clock.  What's the Chicago Fire Package?  Well, there was the radio station in Chicago called Fire.  And then they made a jingle package for that radio station. 
[01:57:30]  And it just sounded good.  Two.  Nine.  106.2 FM.  How do you know a good jingle from a bad jingle?  I actually know the answer to that.  You do?  Every jingle is bad.  Yeah.  Like every host.  You know a good jingle because it's quiet.  You don't hear it.  It really is amazing.  It's got to be catchy, I guess.  You've got to be able to get it stuck in people's heads so they know those calls, right? 
[01:58:00]  And I don't want to hate radio.  I guess I've developed a dislike of it because of what it's become.  But I guess there really is an art to it.  Like, I don't want to dislike all that traditional stuff because some of it really is skilled stuff.  Oh, believe me.  When we tell our listeners to send us jingles, they never sound like that.  We should have the listeners send jingles in again.  They were just fun.  But jingles.  They start sending song parodies.  I know.  They don't know what a jingle is.  We want old school jingles for the radio show.  Do we have our best jingle? 
[01:58:30]  They should make jingles for...  We should make them so that it has to be a jingle for somebody on the show.  Like make a Denny jingle.  Right.  That's a good idea.  Or an E-Rock jingle.  Can you play our best jingle for Dennis Falco?  Oh, I love this one.  E-Rock is a...  No!  He's never heard of that.  That's not memorable.  E-Rock is a...  Oh.  How did he get so far?  That's one of my favorite things.  I do like that one.  Oh, it's great.  I can't not sing that.  I'm talking about...  Oh, man!  And...  Oh, yeah.  Do you have that one? 
[01:59:00]  For Dennis, he's never heard of it.  How about this?  Play it.  This is a good jingle, Dennis, I think.  You can maybe trade this with your friends on Friday.  I'm trying to find it.  I thought I had it over here, too.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Margin.  Margin.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  How did he get so far?  Yeah, that wasn't good.  E-Rock is a dinosaur.  Margin.  I will just fuckin' spontaneously start singing that one. 
[01:59:30]  Hey, 19 past the hour.  What are we gonna stick around for?  Rock and Reverse.  That's on the way.  Yeah, we're gonna keep him for the commercials for that.  He keeps him around.  We're gonna get some TSA out of this, man.  And maybe...  What's TSA?  And maybe we're cumin.  TSL.  Oh, TSL, sorry.  Time spent listening.  Yeah, TSA is the...  I know.  I fucked up everything.  You need a jingle.  Where's the jingle, E-Rock?  E-Rock?  That's our famous jingle.  Find a jingle, you sheep.  Might be on your machine.  I know.  I don't know where, though. 
[02:00:00]  Can you come in and help me?  Stay tuned, because we will have great prizes to give away.  Real prizes, right?  That's part of Rock and Reverse.  All right, Dennis, I want you to listen to this jingle.  How dare you take the headphones off when the on-air light is on?  I was gonna throw out my garbage.  I don't like to keep a cluttered table in front of me.  That's what we say every day before we talk.  We'll throw out our garbage.  All right, here's a jingle.  Rate it.  Rolby!  Anthony!  And Norton, too! 
[02:00:30]  Good times, great hits!  XF-202!  Suck my fucking cock!  What do you think, Dennis?  It's melodic.  It's melodic.  Moronic.  That is a good one.  I would have used some female vocals in there.  Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You need the female in there.  Really?  Nice blend of females.  Maybe stay away from the gang angle?  So the chick should be saying, suck my fucking cock?  I just think it sounds better.  No, that's actually better to hear than you think. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  That's the sore one.  Getting at it.  Should we go back into a jingle contest?  If they know what a fucking jingle is.  But it has to sound like that.  No fucking song.  You have to give them a time limit, too.  It has to be.  It's got to be jingles for people.  And it's got to be jingles.  It's like the type of thing where, like, when Denny comes in, we got the little Denny jingle.  Right.  Yeah.  Then we can play them in the show.  Look, we enjoy a good E-Rock bashing song.  But this is, now we're going into actual jingles.  Old school jingles. 
[02:01:30]  Old school jingles.  So let's put a 15 second limit on it.  And we will throw them the fuck out if they turn into songs.  Remember the last time we did the jingle contest?  They were like a minute, 40 seconds.  No, you put it on the website, the rules on what you want.  Drive the traffic to the website.  Drive the traffic.  Okay.  And say, here's what it has to be.  The stipulation has to be.  Can you take serious XM to drive people to the website?  Because I don't think they understand that concept yet.  They drove people to the website with their big April fools.  What was that again?  I forgot already.  Mime Radio. 
[02:02:00]  Oh, Mime Radio.  Resulting in a big 11 retweets.  Nice.  Hey, what's happening with that other site, by the way?  Oh, I forgot all about that.  Oh, hey.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Let's check out...  All right, so let's get some jingles going.  The jingle contest is on.  Are we thinking 15-second limits?  That's it.  Yeah, yeah, sure.  That's it.  And it's got to be about somebody from the show.  Sure.  Is 15 seconds the limit?  Is that what they normally are?  Probably less even, right?  Probably less.  That is about calling.  Probably 10 seconds.  15 is fine, though.  How long is a standard jingle? 
[02:02:30]  Six, seven seconds.  Yeah, short jingles if it's just call letters, if it's got the imaging liner in there.  The station you wake up with.  Do you like when they slow down the jingle?  No.  Oh, you don't?  No.  Oh, you like a peppy jingle.  Yeah, like a nice shotgun jingle.  99X.  That was a great jingle.  What do you think's a great...  Yeah, what's a great...  What about music radio?  WABC.  Oh, that was a biggie.  That was a biggie.  WABC back in the 60s used to play a jingle at the end of every song.  Oh.  Wow.  At the end of every song.  Wow.  At the end of every song.  Music radio. 
[02:03:00]  WABC.  What's the poll up to?  What did the jingle do?  New York.  They're fucking around because never is down to 83%.  They can't beat...  They're clicking their asses off.  Yeah, but they can't win.  They're not going to get that percentage down.  No, because we're in replay later.  Yeah.  Oh, that's right.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Oh, they're going to get hit again.  Oh, boy.  I predict the poll's going to go down, meaning off their website.  All right, we're going to hold you through the break, and when we get back, we're doing  Rock in Reverse with Dennis Falcone.  I don't think you're saying it right. 
[02:03:30]  Rock in Reverse.  It's on the way.  Oh.  Yeah, you take us to break.  23 past the hour.  Give us a good taking us to break.  Well, let's see.  Let's see.  Who's celebrating a birthday today?  I am.  Let's see.  Happy birthday to Jim, but unfortunately, we don't have any hits by Jim.  Oh, you know what?  How about Welcome Back by John Sebastian?  You got that one for us?  What are you going to do with that?  It's a good song.  I'll show you what we're going to do with that.  Okay.  Okay, that's a great song to play.  Let me know when you have it. 
[02:04:00]  Just hit it.  Sadly, we lost him a year ago.  He played Horseshack on the TV show.  Welcome Back, Cotter.  Ron Polillo.  We lost him a year ago.  My welcome back.  Is he a zombie?  He's on The Walking Dead now.  He was on the show.  No, that's fucking St. Peter singing that to him.  Jesus.  What the fuck?  Yeah, plus you said Welcome...  You said we lost him twice.  Yeah, you can't do the twice.  It's okay.  It's morning, though.  People are just waking up.  I don't know.  You still got to get that point across. 
[02:04:30]  You can be a little sloppy is what you're saying.  I was off the cuff.  You know, I'm just doing stuff off the cuff here for you.  And I still don't have the hot clock.  He doesn't like me.  He doesn't need a hot clock.  I think you have a hot clock.  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean to call you sloppy.  I didn't say sloppy.  It's okay.  You said it.  You didn't like that.  Of course he didn't like being called sloppy.  He's a professional.  It's a quick intro, too.  So you just want to, you know...  Well, you picked it.  I know, because I saw that it would have been his birthday.  I know, I know.  It would have been his birthday, but we lost him a year ago.  Oh, my God.  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  But then you play Welcome Back.  That's a little blue.  But he was on the TV show.  That's a little blue.  Yeah, but that's a little blue.  First word is Welcome Back.  Let's do it.  Wow.  Welcoming a guy back that died is a little blue.  Yeah.  That's a little edgy.  Hey, stick around.  Rock and Reverse is on the way.  25 past the hour.  Hey, Jim Norton.  The Opie and Anthony Channel.  On Sirius XM.  Coming up this week on At The Movies with Norton and Voss.  The guys review the latest Liam Neeson thriller, Taken 2. 
[02:05:30]  It was awful.  It was great.  It stunk.  It was fucking great.  A terrible story.  I loved it.  It was predictable garbage.  Stunk.  Don't be scared of him.  You loved it.  It was terrible.  It was a terrible movie.  I love Liam Neeson.  I think he's amazing.  Her big dad.  Stepdad have pony.  And then at the end, he brings the fucking big singer.  I saved her life.  Oh, it was fucking horrendous. 
[02:06:00]  It was good action, though.  I mean, it was good.  The action was good.  Yes.  But so what?  That's all coming up on the next At The Movies with Norton and Voss.  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Oh, yeah.  Barney Miller.  Uh-huh.  Oh, yeah.  This is quite the bass line.  Bass riff.  Did, did, did, did, did, did.  TV show theme day, right? 
[02:06:30]  Oh, yeah.  Is this an instrumental?  I don't remember.  Yep.  With Ron Glass.  Whatever happened to Ron Glass?  I don't know.  He was a stand-up, right?  I don't know.  Well, I didn't feel like I saw his, um, his headshot.  You don't remember the song?  Yeah.  This is like the Mashed one.  There was a song with it, but they never played it.  No way.  Yeah, Jimmy knows.  Barney Miller, it's a Barney Miller.  Barney Miller, here comes Barney Miller. 
[02:07:00]  That was the song.  No wonder they just decided to play the instrumental.  I'm afraid everyone would just sing all day.  Oh, is that it?  No.  I gotta say, uh, on my Twitter, uh, Halifax underscore NS is making me laugh pretty hard  today.  He writes, how many drifters have met their end in the radio room?  That's great.  He's picking up drifters and fucking murdering them in the radio room.  Showing them his bumper sticker collection.  Yes.  Then hitting him over the head with an old mic. 
[02:07:30]  Uh-huh.  So that's your mic, right?  Uh, well, yeah, sure.  Are you ready, uh, Dennis Falcone?  Because we got all the radio to do today.  It can't be all about you.  Rock and reverse.  Rock and reverse, Tom.  Rock and reverse.  Now, what's the, uh, how does this work?  How do you describe it on the air?  All right, here's what we'll do.  You have three cuts on there?  I sure do, Dennis.  Play one, play the next one, play all three in a row.  Uh-huh.  And then, if you say, play them again.  You can play them twice, and then say, we'll take a caller to identify all three songs. 
[02:08:00]  All three?  You have to identify all three?  I thought it was one song per fucking contestant.  Oh, all three is pretty hard.  No, no, you got three songs.  We have three prizes.  I didn't know how many prizes he had.  Okay, I didn't know how many prizes he had.  How about we do one song?  One song.  For the first person.  But I want Dennis to present this like he would if it was on the air.  Like, how do you explain it to the listener in a fun kind of radio way?  Yeah, we're going to play a sample of a song, a piece of the song, and we put it into the 
[02:08:30]  magic machine, and we spun it around.  Okay?  So the song is in reverse.  Is it really the magic machine?  Well, that's what we call it.  We don't have to identify that it's Pro Tools or it's the radio magic machine here at Magic  100.  So you tie everything in.  You brand it.  You brand it.  I can listen to you all day.  I'll be an Anthony weather forecast.  But everything has to have a name.  The magic machine.  Brand it.  You're branding it.  Because it's fun.  So you own it.  Pro Tools isn't fun. 
[02:09:00]  Now the magic machine, that's fun.  There you go.  Okay.  Fair enough.  So we're going to play the song in reverse.  It's a quick piece of the song, so you've got to listen up.  All right, Dennis.  Why don't you take the first phone call?  It's Jeff on Long Island.  All right, Jeff.  Hello.  Hey, Jeff.  Where are you calling in from?  What town?  Long Island.  Okay.  Lovely this time of year.  All right, Jeff.  You ready?  Do you think you know popular music?  You ready to hit the first song?  Popular music.  Absolutely.  All right.  This song is 80 years old.  We're about to hit the popular music.  Jesus. 
[02:09:30]  Hit the first one.  All right.  Am I getting a decade here?  No.  You listen to it, damn it.  You want to announce the prize he's playing for or no?  I will.  The first prize.  Yes.  And these are all, I was inspired by Dennis.  I wanted to do radio memorabilia prizes.  Oh, wow.  Very good.  So this, uh, the first prize is a very rare item signed by Opie from the Opie and Anthony  show.  Wow.  It is a completed Sudoku puzzle, which Dennis, I'll have you know, was completed. 
[02:10:00]  Don't tell Dennis, please.  During the broadcast of the Opie and Anthony show on March 27th of this year.  Wow.  Is that okay, Dennis?  Wow.  To do other things while you're doing a radio show?  You could have been doing some show prep while you're rehearsing the records you're going  to speak up or talk up.  Well, he did this while he was on the air, not during commercials or while songs were playing.  We tend to do other things here as we're doing a radio show, Dennis.  Let's talk about that when we go over your air check in the morning meeting.  The air check.  So this is for the Sudoku puzzle.  All right.  That's a great prize, guys.  I'll put that on the wall in my closet. 
[02:10:30]  Nice.  Is that where you have your radio room?  All right.  Here we go.  Listen closely.  Oh, sorry, Dennis.  You're supposed to do all this.  Okay.  We're going to play a snippet of a song.  All right.  So it's rock in reverse.  And go ahead, Jim on Long Island.  We're going to play this and see if you can identify it, please.  Oh, that's easy.  What are you doing, Dennis?  Okay.  I'll explain.  Jim?  His name's Jeff.  I have no idea.  Jeff?  Do it one more time.  He has no idea. 
[02:11:00]  Is he allowed to hear it?  Yeah.  All right.  Is it in the rules, the official rules?  Go ahead.  All right.  Oh, that's familiar.  I don't know it, though.  Okay.  So thanks for trying.  You have yourself a good day.  We appreciate you listening, okay?  Don't just give him a prize for trying.  That's what he didn't say to him.  He didn't win.  I thought he would have.  I would say, wait, can we try that again?  That's how Dennis would sign off.  And say, thanks.  Should we try it one more time?  The song?  Yeah. 
[02:11:30]  Okay.  Sir, take a guess.  It's going to kick myself, and I'm missing out on such a good prize.  You give up?  I give up.  It's the Bee Gees, you dumb cunt.  Oh.  I know.  I took the Bee Gees.  I didn't know the.  We kind of rooted for the next one.  We kind of just lost that one.  Well, you can't.  That's not fair to give the next one.  You have to give it a different song.  But we're building up the audience.  Yeah, because then they're like, I know what I know.  And they panic and start calling.  Exactly.  Yes. 
[02:12:00]  And they're hanging in there.  Okay.  Yes.  I apologize.  I didn't mean to blow the gig.  Do you have it the regular way?  You wouldn't talk to your listeners that way?  Ah.  Ah, there it is.  You know what?  Let's give him the Sudoku puzzle.  I already hung up on the guy.  Exactly.  We only got three songs.  What?  What are we going to do with the Sudoku puzzle?  Rip it up.  Who gives a fuck?  No, no, no, no.  We hold on to the prize for the next person.  Yeah, but I got another prize.  I got three prizes.  Yeah, and the prizes definitely get better as we go along.  All right.  The next person.  And there is a punchline with the prizes coming up.  I got a bunch of radio news.  Stay tuned for that. 
[02:12:30]  I'd like to go over with you guys about how we do these things.  I didn't mean to blow it.  I was guessing, too.  I didn't tell me what you were talking about.  Dennis takes this very seriously, Jim.  You don't make the person feel bad.  You give him a little tip.  Hey, it was in a big movie.  Number one.  You'd help him a little?  I'm going to give him some tips there, yeah.  Yeah, because you want to just keep it all fun in the end, right?  Not to call him a nasty female organ.  Well, is there any other kind?  Exactly.  That's right.  Exactly.  It's either the stinkhole one, stinkhole two, or all the dumb things come out of it. 
[02:13:00]  843-17 before the top.  And then we're playing rock and reverse on the O&A extravaganza.  And our second song.  We've got another caller on the line.  Yes, it's Dave in New Hampshire there.  Dave in New Hampshire.  How are you, Dave?  Hello, hello.  How are you?  Got a buddy of mine worked in New Hampshire over at the Brew.  It's a rock station.  Buddy of mine.  All right.  So if you ever went into J.C. Hayes, tell him I said hi.  He's a good radio guy.  What do you think today? 
[02:13:30]  All right, Dave.  Are we ready for song number two?  Now listen up.  This is rock and reverse.  Are we going to tell him the prize?  Yeah.  All right.  The second prize.  Well, Dave is going to be playing for it.  I'll give Dave the Sudoku if he wins, but...  Or give him his choice.  Okay.  He can have the choice.  At this point, because the Sudoku puzzle is still on the table.  The Sudoku, or the second prize is a radio-used Anthony Cumia megaphone.  It is no longer functional, but, I mean, it was part of so many great Anthony Cumia bits  on the Opie and Anthony show.  So that's the second prize. 
[02:14:00]  That should go into the...  And next time, you really got to write these up on the contest form.  So it's...  Dennis, shouldn't we be saving that for the Radio Hall of Fame there?  Yeah, I would put...  Why would we just give that away?  Are you crazy?  Well, I mean, it's a great prize.  Did he do the Mike Tyson bit through that one?  Well, this was done for the SiriusXM years.  All right.  So this is basically ever since we've been in this building.  This is a big prize.  This is a big prize.  Less than three years or so of this.  And you can't take the prize back.  It's like a prop from Caddyshack 2. 
[02:14:30]  Yeah, it really is.  Look.  This is the fork Jackie Mason used at craft services to pick up a donut.  All right.  We got Big Dave on the line.  Maybe Dave's got things to do.  So let's get to cut number two here.  Yes.  I hope Dave does have things to do that involve the same thing as the fucking guy from Buckwild.  I hope Dave lets the park his truck in the mud and take a nap.  All right, Dave.  I'm going to play Rock in the Burst.  Let's spin it back from the magic machine.  I know that.  Oh, come on. 
[02:15:00]  All right.  We're trying to make the listener feel good.  We don't want to drive them crazy.  Oh, I know that.  All right, Big Dave.  What do you got for me?  One more time.  Can you play?  One more time.  For Dave.  What do you call him?  Big Dave.  Big Dave.  All right.  Dave.  Sexual healing.  Marvin Gaye.  All right.  Yeah, way to go.  There we go.  I'm ringing the bell for two reasons.  One is you won.  Nice.  I feel good.  See, I was going to give a hint. 
[02:15:30]  You said to give a fun hint.  I didn't get to give a fun hint.  Why can't Jimmy give his fun hint?  Okay, give the fun hint.  Before he gave.  Well, here's a fun hint.  He was a junkie murdered by his father.  Hey, Big Dave, I want you to have a spectacular day.  He just goes right into this.  Do we have a budget to mail the prize out?  The listener doesn't have to come to the station to pick it up.  Oh, remember those days?  Yeah.  We're going to hide it in the asshole of a homeless person.  You have to come here and pick it up with your teeth.  All right? 
[02:16:00]  I had to go and pick up my WBAB graffiti sweatshirt.  He just brought up another dumb thing.  You always had to go and drive to the station to get your fucking prize.  They didn't have a budget to mail it out to you.  And if you or any member of your family has won something in the past 30 days,  they won't be in the Anthony contest.  No, they don't give me a shit.  Does Dave want the megaphone or the Sudoku?  Oh, I want the megaphone, absolutely.  Of course you want.  All right.  Hold on a line, Dave.  Hold on a line.  We'll get your name and address.  Again, Dave, thanks for listening this morning.  Now, we have an extra prize.  Maybe we should get another quick rock and reverse. 
[02:16:30]  Oh, just make the next one the double daily.  We'll give out both prizes for the last song.  That's fair.  Double daily?  Yeah.  It's like the daily double, only backwards.  All right, so what's the next one?  Rock and reverse.  Thank you.  What's the next prize we're giving away?  It's radio memorabilia today.  Earplugs.  Yeah.  It's the next prize.  So far, it's a science Sudoku puzzle, Anthony's megaphone.  What's the third prize up for grabs?  We play rock and reverse with Dennis Valcone.  It's actually a prize package.  Oh.  It's a package.  Yep.  It's a slightly used Stargate Atlantis mouse pad. 
[02:17:00]  Wow.  Okay, it's that.  Whose retard mouse pad is that?  Hang on, hang on.  Can't get these anymore.  That's how you've got to sell it, Sam.  Right.  Slightly used Stargate Atlantis mouse pad.  Okay, what else?  Right.  A pair of slightly used genuine radio headphones.  Wow.  Authentic professional broadcaster headphones.  Yep.  And this was actually just donated to us.  A slightly used, a little bit of dandruff in it. 
[02:17:30]  Hairbrush.  Wow.  There are hours that go by that Sam doesn't laugh at all.  I had this funny shit going on, but it's something like this.  Look, he's crying.  He's got some crying.  There's tears.  Yeah.  So that's the prize package.  And what makes this special?  Do you know the amount of dumb thoughts that brush has gone over?  Who's stuff is this, Sam?  That was actually, it's prized possessions from a genuine radio office.  Yeah.  And you could tell it's legitimate because on top of the headphones. 
[02:18:00]  Yeah.  Wow.  Because some people write their name on their headphones so they don't get stolen.  Uh-huh.  Dennis, you write your name on your headphones.  Without a doubt, yeah.  Why?  Silver Sharpie.  So because you want to wear your own headphones.  I also put a little station bumper sticker on both ears.  Yeah.  Well, on top of this.  You don't want to be wearing somebody else's cans.  On top of this set of headphones.  Well, unless you're...  Silver Sharpie.  48 past the hour, 12 till the chop. 
[02:18:30]  We're playing Rock and Reverse Tuesday on the Open Anthony Show.  Of course.  Cut three.  Who do we have on the line?  No, we're still...  We're still talking about the prize.  Headphones, a mouse pad, and a brush.  Yeah, but I was about to announce what the name on the headphones was.  Yeah, this is the punchline.  Name?  Is he Rock?  It's E-Rox.  E-Rox, this was very generous of you to bring some prizes to the contest.  I didn't donate shit.  Exactly.  Sam just took a...  Say that on a daily basis.  Sam just took a shit.  I love that we dismiss him as a human being. 
[02:19:00]  Don't even give a fuck if he was bothered by this.  Right off his desk.  A genuine pair of Slobophones.  Slobos!  A Slobobrush and Slobopad.  Right, and then Sal opened up his drawer and said,  You should give away his airbrush.  You're like, you cool with this?  You know how many different styles that brush has gone through?  Oh, exactly.  The fucking slightly highlighted, the shortcut.  You can see, Denny, you can verify for me.  Nagel DNA is still in the hairbrush.  It's in there. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  It's in there.  Just the amount of idiocy that's been fucking between those two fucking earphones.  Oh, absolutely.  The moronics.  And E-Rox, you gotta be good with this, because I learned from Dennis Falcone,  you can't take a prize back, right, Dennis?  No, you don't want to take a prize back.  You don't want to be an Indian giver.  We haven't given it away yet.  What?  We haven't given it away yet.  Oh, well.  Well, we're about to.  Here it goes.  All right.  Rock.  Let's go to Los Angeles. 
[02:20:00]  City of Angels this morning.  Who's on the line?  Gabe.  What's going on, guys?  Gabe.  Don't worry, Gabe.  All right, you ready to play a little Rock in Reverse with us this morning?  Hurry up.  All right, so you got that set.  Just hurry up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Gabe's got things to do.  Uh-huh.  All right, let's get the third cut from The Magic Machine.  You're making them too easy, Dennis.  Shit, I can't tell.  Hold on, one more time.  One more time. 
[02:20:30]  And stick around for Jim Norton's fun, what are you calling him?  His fun hint.  Jimmy will have a fun hint, but first.  Well, maybe he should give the fun hint now.  Give him a minute.  Okay.  Do you know how this works?  I'll take a fun hint.  You want the fun hint?  Please.  He was pretty stumped on it.  Yeah.  I don't want to tell you exactly, but it arrives with mild, mild breasts. 
[02:21:00]  Give it another spin, please.  Is that Wild Wild West, Will Smith?  I can't tell.  Yes!  You feel good.  Bring it back.  Woo!  You won the prize package.  You picked a song that sounds exactly the same backwards and forwards.  I did it because of Anthony's inspiration before.  Yes, yes, indeed.  Yeah.  All right, so he just won a whole bunch of E-Rock shit from his office.  I mean, if you want to make this a weekly feature, we would do some show prepper and 
[02:21:30]  prepare this ahead of time.  Yeah, we don't need to make this weekly.  Okay.  We're going to want another contest, a different one.  Yeah, exactly.  When you come up with a different contest, let us know.  Yeah.  All right, so our buddy Gabe in Los Angeles, you got the home run prize pack here this  morning.  Wow.  What's the home run prize pack, Sam?  Well, it's a slightly used Stargate Atlantis mouse bag.  Wow, that's a good one right there.  He loves Stargate, though.  He's not going to be able to get another one of those.  It's some genuine radio professional used headphones. 
[02:22:00]  That's nice.  Slightly used.  Right.  You can't give his headphones away.  Yeah.  Well, we can't take them back a prize.  Oh, that's right.  And a hairbrush with genuine Nagel DNA.  Wow.  In the hairbrush.  Do you know how many times he's stashed away that Nagel seed when he left a house with  a condom that he didn't want some woman squeezing up their vaginas and getting that Prince Nagel?  Now, he's just giving away a cloning opportunity with some hair follicles. 
[02:22:30]  Iraq, you got congratulations to give out?  No, go fuck yourself.  Oh.  Oh, Dennis.  You don't like that, right?  Well, Gabe, we thank you for being a part of it this morning.  Make sure you tell your friends, Opie and Anthony, right here on SiriusXM.  And tell your friends.  Oh, boy.  Hold on a line.  By the way, the animals that we work with?  Yeah.  Like, I was going through Iraq stuff to figure out what to give away.  Yeah.  And the people that he shares an office with are just trying to figure out what his absolute 
[02:23:00]  most prized possessions are.  I'm like, no, we're trying to make it at least somewhat fun.  He's like, oh, no, he's got autographs stashed in here.  Like I said, we dismiss him as a human being.  Yeah, I love that.  And we had some fun this morning with Gabe and Dave calling in.  Also, I've got to say hi to Scott, who checks in on the email this morning.  Thanks so much.  See, he likes to hear his name on the air.  See, that's what he's saying.  People like hearing their name.  Scott's another DJ from Long Island Way.  Okay.  He specializes in ballroom dancing. 
[02:23:30]  Yeah, for the upper demos.  Tangos, salsa, merengues, all the different ballroom dancing.  Garth Marengue.  Yeah, so there's a variety of us out there.  Uh-huh.  DennisFalcone.com.  There you go.  Again, it's been a pleasure playing rock and reverse.  I want to have another contest.  Yeah?  You do?  Yeah.  What?  How about this?  We can have a girl with the biggest clit, and first prize is a dunce hat with a propeller on it. 
[02:24:00]  That's seven before the top.  Another Iraq prize.  All right, Dennis.  I'm going to let you leave with that.  Thank you again.  I appreciate it.  Even though the mic is still hot and the on-air light's on, but it's okay this time around.  Just back up for the mic.  Take care of guys for the blast.  It has.  It has indeed.  All right.  That's fantastic.  We could have an intern come in here and package up Iraq's shit, please.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's valuable stuff right there.  We're actually going to mail out his shit?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, it's illegal to give somebody a prize and then not send it to them. 
[02:24:30]  Iraq, you cool with this?  No.  You kind of need the headphones.  Hey, you get a new brush.  You never have them on.  We need something.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  That hurts.  Good one.  Just use your little iPod, Buds.  You'll be fine.  Yeah.  Sack of shite.  All right.  We got the Cardinal.  Cardinal Dolan.  That's the New York guy, right?  Yes.  Yeah.  He has some stuff to say about the geese.  About the geese.  And Chris Brown, excuse me, on the Today Show. 
[02:25:00]  He was up here yesterday.  Did you see him, Sam?  Was he really here?  No.  He was in the building, like, three.  Mm-mm.  I think, didn't Cindy Brady say something, too, about the geese?  What did she say?  Cindy Brady?  What did she say?  Cindy Brady.  I believe she's taking a little bit of heat.  It might build.  It might just go away.  Because she said that she felt like she had a second dad in her, of course, Mr. Brady,  Robert Reed, and said that he died because of being gay. 
[02:25:30]  That's what killed him.  Being gay killed Robert Reed, is what she's saying.  But does she mean because...  Well, getting the AIDS and that.  Some say that's...  Well, a lot of people say it's a gay disease, right?  Yeah.  But she's basically...  They won't say that anymore, though?  No, but she's saying that being gay killed him.  Like, if he wasn't gay, he wouldn't have gotten the AIDS, and he wouldn't have been dead.  So that's what, you know, Cindy Brady's saying.  And people are mad at that?  Yeah.  Buddy Hinton. 
[02:26:00]  He's saying, baby talk, baby talk, it's a wonder you can walk.  That's the first volley that's been thrown at her, but we'll see what happens later.  I met Cindy Brady through Greg Brady.  Yeah.  I don't know their names.  I just know him as that.  Even though I was friends with...  Michael Lickenland.  I was friends with Greg Brady for a few years there, and I got to meet Cindy Brady.  You met Susan Olsen?  Tough broad.  Wow, yeah.  A little tough.  Yeah?  Tough broad.  Where'd you meet her?  How come I never heard this story? 
[02:26:30]  You never told us?  I never heard this one.  I used to pail around with...  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You can't take your headphones back.  We have to mail them out to Gabe.  Iraq, it's now a prize.  Actually, Iraq is stealing, because that's not his anymore.  What the fudge?  No, I became friends with Barry Williams, who played Greg Brady.  And after one of our...  I think it was when we were on Satellite, I think.  After our morning show, he had to do one of those satellite tours.  Ah.  Where they throw him in a little fucking studio, and he talked to morning shows 
[02:27:00]  from across the country, and it was him and Cindy Brady.  Hung out with them for like two, three hours.  Tough broad.  What do you mean?  What do you mean tough?  What'd she do?  A taste of the dyke.  Wow, really?  It's really...  Do you think she's gay?  I have no idea.  No, I don't be either of you.  I'm not going down that road.  I have no idea.  Did she come off as that one?  Tough broad.  Okay.  A little tough.  Jesus Christ.  Yeah, you see what I'm saying?  She was a little tough.  She's a mess.  Wow. 
[02:27:30]  She had big tits.  Yeah, she had Cindy tits.  Fat tits.  She had a...  Yeah, she was a little...  Looks like she's smuggling two kitty carry-alls.  She was like...  She was a bit on the plump side when I met her.  Yeah?  Not like, you know, over-the-top fat.  Just a little plump.  Yeah.  Was she a piggy?  She was a tough broad.  Very...  Masculine?  Eh, yeah.  Truck driver-ish.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy. 
[02:28:00]  No?  Oh, boy.  It happens.  That's not good.  Oh, boy.  She didn't seem like a happy person.  No?  Really?  Not like fucking Greg is, you know...  Oh, he's all about showbiz.  He embraced being Greg Brady and fucking Johnny Bravo.  She wasn't mean or anything.  She was just a little hard.  Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do cruising down the highway in my makeshift.  Did she sing for you?  No.  No?  She couldn't wait to get the fuck out of there.  Boy, you're promoting it. 
[02:28:30]  I don't remember what they were promoting.  It was some kind of...  Dancing all through the night.  I don't remember.  It was something...  Keep on, keep on, keep on...  Something about the 70s.  Keep on doing it right.  Right.  Do-do-do-do-do.  They did a little dance.  Yeah.  It's gonna be a beautiful day.  Yeah.  This is them.  Oh, yeah.  Little Brady kids.  Oh.  And daddy's sucking. 
[02:29:00]  And our dad is really gay.  Pop has never met a cock he didn't like.  Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on sucking all through the night.  That's it.  Look at...  Oh, look at them.  That's what they look like.  Yep.  On the, uh...  What was it?  Amateur hour?  Yeah.  Peter Stern amateur hour?  Hoo-hoo.  Isn't that weird? 
[02:29:30]  It's like fucking America's Got Talent.  And it was Peter Stern's amateur hour.  I ripped them off, Robin.  Barry Williams looks like...  What was he, like 30 when he filmed the Brady Bunch?  I know, right?  What the fuck?  Get older than everyone else, huh?  Let me see that.  Oh, I love the fucking cutaway of the family dancing.  Oh, yeah.  They're watching, uh...  Watching their kids on the TV.  Keep on, keep on, keep on.  Look how off they are. 
[02:30:00]  Is that lip syncing?  Oh, just a little.  Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on.  They lose track of where the camera is.  No talent family  Look at Cindy  She can't even fucking rock  Nice costumes though  Now they do a little dance  And Mrs. Brady is putting fucking Wesson oil  On Mr. Brady's fist chair  It was a modern piece of art 
[02:30:30]  It was just a giant fist that stuck out of the living room floor  And he'd sit on it until his cheeks were  As they would say, scraping rug  She'd have to lube it up with Wessonality  The chair's got a certain Wessonality 
[02:31:00]  Wow  That's great  And then they do the slow fade  And they bow  But the music faded out  And they were still singing  Very weird, yeah  They would have had to all start singing lower  Right  Yeah, that's what happened  You had Michelle DeBeal on?  Is that how you say your name?  Michelle Beedle  How was she?  She's awesome  I love Michelle Beedle  Yeah, she's great  Oh, you misspelled her 
[02:31:30]  B-E-A-L-E?  No, Beedle  Alright, you misspelled it on your Instagram  Who was she?  She's almost hot  Oh, she's sexy, man  She's almost hot  I think she broke her nose or something  And fucked up her whole face  From being really hot  Yeah, man  She's almost hot  We should have her on  Is she on Sports Nation or something?  She used to be  How do you know her, Jimmy?  We're friendly  Oh  Alright, we probably should have had her on  We're Twitter buddies  Maybe we should have saw a picture of her  I know her  She's on Sports Nation 
[02:32:00]  Yeah  But she used to be  She's not on anymore  Oh, she's not?  She left ESPN  Oh, that's true  She has a show on NBC Sports I did called  Crossover  Yeah, with her and the other  Is that her in a bikini?  And she's on Access Hollywood  Is that her in a bikini?  She's on Access Hollywood?  She's almost hot  Her nose is a little fucked up  Really?  I think she's really sexy  You do, huh?  Yeah, I really do  I don't know who she is  We should have had her on  Come on, crank that  We messed that one up  Who's the one on the right?  The guy  Not the guy  He's on the right 
[02:32:30]  To his right  Okay  And who's the one in between the two?  What do you mean?  The dude?  No, who's the one next to the dude?  The one to the left?  Yeah  That's Michelle Bean  That's her  Okay  Can we have her on?  She's pretty fucking  Yeah, she's right across the street  Oh, that's right  They do the show  Yeah, we'll have her on  Pretty hot  We'll have her on  Where were we?  I don't know  But I find myself wanting to give her a good hug  Yeah  Speaking of tough broads  I don't know 
[02:33:00]  I didn't tell Santa  So it might take a minute  But Real Sports with Brian Gumbel  Is doing a story on a tough broad  Oh yeah?  It's the preview clip for  The show that's coming on  In two weeks, I think  Oh, Betsy Curland?  Betsy Curland, yes  Hey, what do we got here?  Looks like a gang of hipsters  Basically, it's a guy  That plays basketball  Uh-huh  Played for college when he was about 18  Oh  As a freshman, I believe 
[02:33:30]  Yeah  You know  Brian Gumbel does those sports stories  He sure does  And then the guy took 30 years off  30 years off  And you see this for an entire time  Where you see a guy go  He goes back to college  And you're allowed to fucking jump on the teams  You know?  Yeah  I remember a story of an old guy  I think he was like 60  And he was playing  No way  Basketball on the basketball team  For, you know, a smaller college  Why would they allow him on there?  All right, you got the clip  Which one?  It's down  This one?  Yep  Hold on a minute  Hold on a minute  So, yeah  See, you weren't sure, right? 
[02:34:00]  So, guy, 18  Plays basketball in college  For whatever reason  He dropped out of school or whatever  Went away for 30 years  He's coming back  He goes back to college  And he goes back on the basketball team  As a giant Herman Munster woman  Sex change, obviously  Sex change  Mm-hmm  Mm-hmm  And the preview clip  Someone turned it on  Turned me on to this on Twitter yesterday  I thank you  She gave me a plug  I can't wait to see the show 
[02:34:30]  It's so fucked up  You want to play it for everybody?  Yeah  This is where the visual element  For the Opie and Anthony show  Was coming in handy  We're never going to have that  No  We'll put it on our Facebook page  Opie and Anthony, though  That's a nice graphic  All our visual shit goes up there  Back in the early 80s  Oh, boy  Robert Ludwig played a season of college bowl  Before disappearing from the game  Number 42  Gabrielle Ludwig  Now after 30 years  He  Has reappeared  Oh, stop it 
[02:35:00]  Stop it  Stop it  Last summer  Fresh off sex free assignment surgery  Gabrielle Ludwig  Walked onto the women's team  Lumbered  Mission College  In Santa Clara, California  Stop  I was on the basketball court  Six weeks  Did you fully believe  Hey, I can be kind of like  Bob used to be physically  And now I'm out here  And it's like  Whoa  Absolutely  I had to start  From scratch  And build my body  Pause  My practices  Always ended with me  Those look like  Meatloaf's bitch tits  From fucking Fight Club 
[02:35:30]  But  She doesn't look anything  Like a woman  No  Not at all  She's got a giant male body  And  Maybe she's still going  Through the hormones  Or something  I don't know  Man  Why don't you just cut it out  Stop  Right  Knock it off  But to go play with  I don't know  You know  You go down this road  People get pissed  But I don't  I got it  I don't understand this  I don't understand that one  I don't understand this shit  This has always ended with me 
[02:36:00]  In some sort of agonizing position  This is the kind of agony  Gabby has always wanted  Because the body  She's now running up and down  The court in  Finally feels like  It's the right one  Stop it  That's it  Unfortunately  That's it  I'm watching this one  That is a large  Large  Man woman  Rogan's right though  About the bone structure  And all that stuff 
[02:36:30]  You can see it  You can see it  Go to the comments  Because I was reading  Some of the comments  Yesterday on the YouTube clip  I was laughing my ass off  Someone goes  Is this an SNL clip  That does look like a bit  An SNL bit or whatever  Yeah there it is  Is this a Saturday night live skit  Yeah it did look  I did look like a bit  This guy writes  What the hell is wrong  With this world  This is sick  How can they allow a man  To play in a woman's league  Remember when they used to  Fucking dress Adam Sandler 
[02:37:00]  And Farley up  As girls  Yeah yeah yeah  That's what it looked like  It's like the Farley character  Leave the world  That's mine  I'm hungry  I'm hungry  That's the bit  Lay off I'm hungry  Was that the  Lay off I'm hungry  I'm starving  That was great  More like Adam Sandler though  Yeah yeah  That's a big bitch  Fuck  Guys  Guys that  Say they're girls  Like that  Can't play sports  Against girls 
[02:37:30]  It's  It's not nice  It's not very sporting  I agree  Wowie  Kazowie  Yes  Oh the Cardinal  That's right  Okay  So Cardinal Dolan  Is talking about the geese  Today  Yeah  Or yesterday  What do you say  As a minister  As a pastor  To a gay couple  That comes to you  And say  We love God  We love the church  But we also love each other 
[02:38:00]  And we want to raise  As a family  In faith  What do you say to them  Well the first thing  I say to them  Is I love you too  And God loves you  And you are made in God's  I love you  Sounds like Pendulet  And I love you too  Jesus  It's  It's  Why  Why  Why  You can't  Humans aren't capable  Of this  Unconditional love  Where you don't know  The person  But just because  You're a human  On this earth  You love them  That's not being sincere 
[02:38:30]  He's not being sincere  He goes  I love them too  No you don't  You don't love them  No  It takes away  From the word love  And the true meaning  Of it  Why do they get  You must love everybody  I love everybody  No you don't  Not only do you not  Love everybody  You don't like anybody  Right  I love you  You love me  It's fucking Barney  It's fucking  Cardinal Barney  I love the homos too 
[02:39:00]  Oh boy  Aren't they wonderful  Look just because  You like  Getting your dick  All shitty  Doesn't mean  You're not loved  By Barney  Family  With an F  U  C  K  In your  A  S  This is fucking  It's not  You don't believe in this  No  This would be a nice world  To live in  It would be  But it ain't  We all love each other 
[02:39:30]  Sorry to fucking  Disappoint everyone  But the Cardinal  Doesn't love everyone  No  He loves his family  I'm sure  He's not a lot of  He loves his close friends  He's not a lot of  Family  Family though  Well he fucking  Came out of someone  I guess  You know  That  But some homeless guy  That he's like  I love you  Because you're a human  If he loved everybody  Why doesn't he keep  The fucking doors open  Exactly  Don't they close St. Pat's  So the homeless  Don't pee on everything  And you were made 
[02:40:00]  In God's image  And likeness  And we want  Your happiness  But  And you're entitled  To friendship  But we also know  That God has told us  That the way to happiness  That especially  When it comes to sexual  Isn't through the ass  That is intended  Only for a man and woman  In marriage  Where children  Can come about  Naturally  We gotta be  We gotta do better  To see that our  Defense of marriage  Is not reduced  To an attack  On gay people  And I admit  We haven't been  Too good at that  We try our darndest  To make sure 
[02:40:30]  We're not anti-anybody  We're in the defense  Of what God has taught us  About marriage  And it's one man  One woman forever  To bring about new life  We gotta do better  To try to  Take that away  From being  Anti-anybody  By the way  So I guess  Yeah it's fair  I guess  If new life  Is the goal  Then I guess  Women or men  Who are infertile  Are somehow  Living in sin  Because there's  No possibility  Of new life  Or God is just 
[02:41:00]  Punishing them  They're useless  They're useless  It's the best description  I've heard of the whole thing  He's smart  He's very very  Millennium  That's a smart way  To say that shit  But  Goes against the bible  They say  Like I said  It's always defense  Of something  It's never  It's never trying  To take something  From someone  You're just trying  To defend what you have  Right  So that's  You know  Like gun control  They call it  Gun safety act  We're saving people  From that  We're not taking  Your rights away  We're saving  Other people  Are you 
[02:41:30]  And then this  It's like  We're not taking  Your right away  As a gay couple  But marriage  Is to be saved  For a man and a woman  Call it something else  Call it shenanigans  Chicanery  I don't think God  Gives a fuck  About marriage  Yeah  God cares about  Some fucking legal document  From the state  What idiots are we  Like even if you  I don't mind people  Believing God  Like I get that  I mean I kind of  Struggle with that  But do you really think  God gives a fuck  About the legalities  Of the state 
[02:42:00]  I don't know  Does he  No he doesn't  No  Who knows  He has to worry about  Light years  And travel  And asteroids  No we're the center  Of his world  But he cares about  What with what  In the front of their  Fucking crotch  Sticks what  With what  In front of someone else's  Crotch  What hits  It's just idiocy  Toodalido  Oh  The Pope likes a guy  And a gal  Toodalido  Oh the Pope 
[02:42:30]  Don't like two guys  Toodalido  Oh  The Pope likes marriage  Just how it is  Toodalido  The Pope don't want  No changes  No he don't  Toodalido  Toodalido  Toodalido  Oh  The Pope likes  When guys and gals  Get along  Toodalido  Toodalido  Yeah  Toodalido  That's right  Yeah that's  That fits  Because they don't  Like that shit 
[02:43:00]  Oh  The Pope will  Watch your tootsies  Wait  The Pope will  Wash your tootsies  Toodalido  Because he's washing  He's washing a bunch  Of uh  That's right  Yeah criminals  Feeties  That's right  He likes washing  Toodalido  The Pope likes  Soap and water  Toodalido  Is it soapy water  Soap and water  That he washes  I thought it was like  Just oil and fucking  Water and stuff  Oh  Ointment  Yeah  The Pope likes  Frankincense and myrrh  Toodalido  The Pope don't like guys 
[02:43:30]  Putting in each other's asses  Toodalido  Aw  It's too dirty to use  For the Pope  Yeah  I uh  I went to church  Because of the holiday  You did  I go about two  Three times a year now  Oh  And on the way out  Uh  Someone in my  Gang there  Decided that  You know  The kids should be blessed  Not just mine  But there's other kids  In the scenario here  Uh huh  From other families  That were with us  And uh  So the  Two priests 
[02:44:00]  I ran into two priests  On the way out  I need a young priest  And an old priest  And I  The exorcist  Yeah  And he couldn't be cooler  And he did his blessing thing  His mumbo jumbo shit  If it works great  Whatever  I don't know  I don't know  But  I was so uncomfortable  Because all I think  Is that  He touches kids  Abuse  Yeah  He's an older  He's an older priest  So I'm like  You had to know something  Is that bad?  No  It probably wasn't  Accurate  I was completely  Uncomfortable  Because I could see 
[02:44:30]  I'm like  That's all you think  When you see a priest now  Especially the older ones  He probably knew something  Yeah  Yeah  The whole organization  Is fucking tainted  And I'm glad  That that's  That's what  They're covering up  Has gotten them  Yeah  That's what  It's like  You can't look at a priest  Without thinking  Child molester  It's the first thought  In my head  And he didn't do  Anything  Wrong  Yeah  But it's the first thought  That crossed my mind  Yeah  You know  It was a fine  Sermon I guess  I don't know 
[02:45:00]  We were excited  Because it was told to me  He's the quickest in the parish  So like  He gets this shit done  That's nice  45 minutes I'm talking  In and out  Thank you very much  Yeah  That's good  You don't want to sit there  For any length of time  By the way  I got a tweet  From Rick and Sonia Mcnail  Says  Bible says  Obey the Lord  And follow the laws of man  So God cares about state law  So I guess God says  The speed limit  God cares about the speed limit  What about sugary drinks  What about sugary drinks  And does God  I guess  State law at one time 
[02:45:30]  Makes interracial marriage  Illegal  So I guess God  Thought interracial marriage  Was illegal  Praise Jesus  Rick and Sonia  You're not going to win this one  Larry's going to  Larry's going to  Take you on though  Larry in Texas  He says  You don't have a  Handle on what God is  Larry  Fair enough  Hello boys  Hi Larry  Good morning Larry  I'm sorry we don't have  A prize for your phone call  No that's okay  I'm still waiting  To get back home  To get my own  Personal Opie Sudoku 
[02:46:00]  Pussy Sam  So thoughtfully  Sent to me  It's going to be  A valuable family heirloom  Yes it will  Yes it will  Jim when you talk about  What God cares about  Or doesn't care about  Then you haven't  Read the Bible itself  Because God talks about  How the beast  What Jesus talked about  That the birds of the air  And they neither toil nor spin  Yet the good Lord above  Sees to their needs  How much more  Will he do for you  Because human beings  Are valued creations  And when God says 
[02:46:30]  It's wrong  For homosexual activity  Is wrong  It is abomination  And it was reinforced  In the book of Ephesians  As well as the Old Testament  Scriptures  In Deuteronomy  That is an evil  Evil thing  He lost double jeopardy  Because he did not know  Who Deuteronomy was  What movie was that from?  Graham was the one  That said  If God doesn't punish America  He owes Sodom and Gomorrah  An apology  And it's true  Can I ask you a question though  Just to jump in  Because I'm certainly  No biblical scholar 
[02:47:00]  But no  You're right  I haven't really read  The entire Bible  And I have zero interest in it  Other than the fact  That there are some  Nice messages in it  But it was  300 years after Christ died  No I think 300  How many years after Christ died  Did they get the Bible out there?  The canon voted  300 years after I voted  Was it?  Okay I apologize  I could be wrong  But it's like  Basically the Bible  Which I think means  Many books  Or something to that effect  Was the most popular stories  In sermons  Were voted on  So there was 
[02:47:30]  Story after story  Edited  And left out  Of the Bible  So the Bible  To me  Even if it was  The word of God  Is by no means  A complete picture  It is  It's the cliff notes  Dude  It's exactly  It's the opinions  Of people voting  300 years  After Christ was dead  But they got everything  Right back then  You're mischaracterizing that  Oh shit  Okay  Yes 
[02:48:00]  Because the Old Testament  What is we call  Now the Old Testament  The Torah  And the Pentateuch  It was new  When they wrote it  It was given to Moses  It was given to Moses  By God  The law  Holy mo  Yeah  It was given to Moses  Many times before  That scholarship  Is unquestioned  That is unquestioned scholarship  Wait  It's unquestioned  That God handed Moses  A bunch of  Hold on  Dude  Hold on  Hold on  Larry  Larry  Larry  Relax  Relax  So you're saying  That God just handed  Moses this stuff 
[02:48:30]  God told it to Moses  Yes  And that's  Undisputable  It's undisputable  It's not in dispute  At all  Because  By who  I disputed  Jimmy disputes  I disputed  Larry  Well then  History would prove you wrong  Because all those books  The Old Testament books  Of the law  Were given to Moses  Daniel was a historic figure  That predated  And then he fucking  Tried to take some chick 
[02:49:00]  To a show  And told the boss things  And got fired  See Larry  The thing is this  You believe  And I wish I could  But I don't anymore  Or I do very little  And honestly  I know you're sincere  And I'm not shitting on you  But when I talk to  To people who believe  As strongly as you do  You convince me more and more  The other way  Oh boy  But I'm not  I swear I'm not being a jerk  Or I'm not knocking Larry  But it's because  You can't see things 
[02:49:30]  The way I see them  In that  Like you  Hold on  Hold on  Any type of doubt  That comes in  You go  No no  Like a logical person knows  That that's a really rough one  To swallow  And I want somebody  Who's able to look at it like that  To still be able to tell me  Why it makes sense  It's faith based  It's not fact based  So if this guy has  The unwavering faith in this  Then to him  It happened  And it's real  But there's no  Actual physical evidence 
[02:50:00]  For people that need  Scientific proof  That any of that happened  Sir  And can I ask you something  Larry  That's where I'm wrong  What about the Bible passages  Dealing with slavery  How do you treat your slaves  Oh  Well when  Bookmark that  In the time of the day  That slaves were common  And they called them servants  Rather than slaves  Okay  But Philemon  When  When  The  I think it was  The apostle Paul  Saul of Tarsus  Who wrote to Philemon 
[02:50:30]  He was talking about  How a slave is supposed to  Deal with his master  And how a master is supposed  To deal with his  Wait  So instead  You didn't have  I'm sorry  The God  This terrific God  And it wants to tell everybody  How like  Be nice to mom and dad  And don't worship  False idols  But doesn't think to say  Slavery is despicable  Well  He works in mysterious ways  Have you ever heard of the term Jubilee?  Uh  Yes  Yes  It was my nickname  For my friend 
[02:51:00]  My friend  Bully  My Jewish friend  Bully  What's that?  The wheels were wobbly  But he got there  But the Jews  Had a Jubilee year  Jubilee  They had a Jubilee year  Listen  Now please  Hear me out  Okay  Because  All of  All debts were forgiven  During the Jubilee year  And all slaves were freed  But  If a slave  Desired to remain a slave 
[02:51:30]  Then he would be  A slave the rest of his life  Why?  Because  Debts in those days  When they  When the Bible talks about  Borrowing  Without collateral  What they used  For the term collateral  You forfeited  Your life  For that debt  For the  For the borrower  Slave to the lender  And if you couldn't pay your debts  Then you became a slave  To the person  Who loaned you the money  Now that debt  Would be forgiven  During the Jubilee year  But if you 
[02:52:00]  Felt that your needs  Were being cared for  And you knew  That you didn't have  What it took  To make it  As a non-slave  You could elect  To be a slave  For the rest of your life  That's why  That's why the Bible  Talks about  How masters  Deal with slaves  And how slaves  Deal with masters  Oh so the slaves  Were just  Oh the slaves  Were voluntary  After the Jubilee  They chose to be slaves  After the Jubilee  Okay I see  Then they're just  Fucking slaves  Okay that's a  I will say this Larry  Excellent way of explaining  An obvious flaw  In the fact that the Bible 
[02:52:30]  Did not say slavery  Was reprehensible  I'm not making this up  Someone else did  Alright but  Someone's got  Someone's got a counterpoint  To your whole argument  The Zuba  On Twitter  The Eleven  What is it  What is it called  It's worth going through too  It says  Eleven other things  The Bible is against  That we all ignore  What are they  You gotta see the list  By the way  Did Jesus himself  Reference homosexuality 
[02:53:00]  Or no  I don't think  Jesus himself  Talked about  Homosexuality  But it was written  Extensively about  By Paul  But again Paul  But why not the guy  So you're actually  Listening to Christ's  Friends and not him  Well  Because Christ  Christ was talking about  Why the earth  Needed a savior  Why man needed a savior  And about the father  And trying to train the world  That he was God's  Perfect Passover lamb  That his blood  Took away the sins  Of the world  Right  The only other thing 
[02:53:30]  I want to say to you Jim  And I'm serious about this  And it's not a slam  Is burning hell  Yes  No  Jim you're a queer  Jim seriously  If you want to know God  If you sincerely and truly  Want to know God  Look to your left  God will make himself  Known to you  I'm there  He will make himself  Known to you  I'm not kidding about  I know you're not  He scares me  And that's why I'm not  Arguing with you  Because I know you're  A sincere guy  And I know that you  Are you're a bright guy  Obviously and you're  Explaining yourself  So it's like we just  Don't agree on that  And I believe  I wish 
[02:54:00]  You were right  And I'm not 100%  Convinced that there isn't one  But I'm convinced  That the Catholicism is wrong  I get that part  Of what he's saying  Yeah  But not in the  Organized religion way  No I think that the Bible  Is made up by people  I totally agree  With what you just said there  If there's a God  One more thing fast  One more thing really fast  Sure Larry  Jesus didn't come to be a Baptist  He didn't come to be a Catholic  He didn't come to be a Methodist  That's man's invention  Jesus came to save mankind  And reconcile mankind 
[02:54:30]  Back to be the creator  From his fallen state  God didn't send Jesus  To be any denomination  That's all man's invention  That's why you should read your Bible  Because your Bible  All right  Larry I totally agree with you  We should go  We should go all the way back to that  And then start from there again  Exactly correct  All right Larry  Thank you Larry  Larry in Texas  All right Larry  Thank you  But see the people  That are against gay marriage  And stuff  This little website  What is it called Sam  11 other things  That the Bible bans  But we all do anyway 
[02:55:00]  Uh oh  Well you might do  I don't know if I do  Some of them  Some of them are kind of  Whatever  But this  All right  Go ahead Sam  Round haircuts  The Bible says  You shall not round off  The side growth  Of your heads  Nor harm the edges  Of your beard  Nor harm  That's why a lot of guys  Don't cut their beard  And have pegas  What  Yeah  So if you're cutting  Your hair basically  You're you know  You're sinning  Bieber is fucking doomed  Yeah  The Bieber  The Bieber shit  The Beatles  Yeah 
[02:55:30]  The Beatles  They reference the Beatles  Haircut in here  Uh the football one's  Kind of dumb  But go through it anyway  You shall not eat their flesh  Nor touch their carcasses  They are unclean to you  That's obviously  Pigs  Yeah  I don't dig on swine  So a lot of people  That are against gay marriage  They're eating pig all day long  That's right  Bacon's good  Pork chops good  Go with three  Uh fortune telling  Do not turn to mediums  Or spiritists  Do not seek them out  To be defiled by them  And you're quoting the Bible  Who's quoting the Bible  Pendulet  Who's quoting the Bible 
[02:56:00]  With those  Yeah that's Leviticus 1931  I know  Yeah you should say that  All this stuff  Sam is actually quoting the Bible  Pulling out  Pulling out  This is in Genesis 38  9 10  Abacab  Uh  Nice  Nice  Look up on the wall  So pulling out  Yeah  Sorry  No go ahead  I'm singing Genesis  So when he went 
[02:56:30]  Into his brother's wife  He wasted his seed  On the ground  In order not to give  Offspring to his brother  But what he did  Was displeasing  In the sight of the Lord  So he took his life also  This is a good angle  And everything  Because there's so many people  Against gay marriage  But they're fucking  Doing all this other shit  That's against the Bible  But like to someone  Like Larry  Or someone that believes  Story in the Bible  Does that really make sense to you  That God doesn't want you  Pulling  Like you only  Sex is so much fun  And you're only supposed to  Procreate  You're not supposed to 
[02:57:00]  Dump loads on their ass cheeks  The beauty  I think  He's testing you  I see the beauty of the Lord  In my load on tits  Absolutely  Or my belly button  Oh  God  I definitely dig God  After I cum  You think your belly button  Is sick of your cum by now  Dude  I'm sick of my cum by now  My belly button  Is I have left to hear  I just had it  If you could have seen  The fucking  The towel wrecker  I fucking dolloped out  Last night  Towel wrecker  Holy mackerel  A black towel  And a small hand towel 
[02:57:30]  Really  I fucking dolloped out  A gallon of semen  Yeah  From my belly button  Wow  Alright keep going  Tattoos  I mean  Tattoos  It's in the Bible  So everyone want a fucking tattoo  What does it say about tats  Well Leviticus 1928  You shall not make any cuts  In your body  For the dead  Nor make any tattoo marks  On yourselves  Yep  They actually use the word tattoo  In the Bible  Oh yeah  Interesting  Polyester  Or any other fabric blends 
[02:58:00]  Are banned  How is that  Leviticus 1919  Leviticus is a twat  Really  Leviticus cared about polyester  Leviticus is all about this shit  Yeah I wonder who wrote that  Maybe it was the wool manufacturers  Polyester is evil  It is the devil's cum sewn up  Fucking idiocy  Nor you shall not wear a garment  Upon you  Of two kinds  Of material  Mixed together  Why  Obviously polyester 
[02:58:30]  Why would that matter  What's the fucking reason  Yeah  Do not question the Lord  Oh  Divorce  Well that's a biggie  Well we know about that  What does it say in the Bible  The quote from the Bible  And who said it  Mark 10 8  What therefore God has joined together  Let no man separate  I thought it was  Terra Sunder  Yeah put us back up  No man separate  Oh okay  Letting people without testicles  Into church  Get the fuck out of here  Yeah 
[02:59:00]  Read that  Deuteronomy  But no start  Whether you've been  Sous out  Or lost one  Or two balls to cancer  Isn't important  The Bible doesn't  Get that specific  It just says  You can't pray  If you're missing  A testicle or two  Yeah  Wow so I guess  Testicular cancer survivors  According to the Bible  Right  Are not welcome in church  That's why this is a great little list  What's the actual quote from the Bible  And who said it  Deuteronomy 23 1  A man whose testicles are crushed  Or whose penis is cut off 
[02:59:30]  May never join the assembly of the Lord  So basically  Wow  John Bobbitt  Fucked  Could not have gone to church  It's just  It's just silly  What is the reasoning  Does it say  I want a reason  Let's see  Oh and the next verse says  That if you're a bastard  The child of a bastard  Or even have  A great great great great great great  Grandchild of a bastard  You can't come to church  Or synagogue  And we probably all have  A great great great great great  Great grandchild of a bastard  Which is really great  That God is punishing you 
[03:00:00]  For the sins of the people before you  That's good  That's great  Wearing gold  We all love wearing gold  Sure we do  The Vatican has enough of it  Why can't I wear it  Yeah they're wearing gold  All over the fucking place  Gold in my watch  Timothy 2 9  Timothy  Yeah  Likewise I want women  To adorn themselves  Proper clothing  Modestly and discreetly  Not with braided hair  And gold or pearls  Or costly garments  Fucking horse  That's because the guys  Want to keep the shit  For themselves  Well the next one's

[03:01:00]  Of the water  And among all the living creatures  That are in the water  They are detestable things to you  See the problem is  They just didn't know enough shit yet  Before they started writing  They never had sushi  Right  They didn't  Yeah  I would understand  That a lobster  Would look like  Detestable bug  But they're wonderful  It would look horrific  Of the first people  That saw them  Cook it up  And they would probably  Think you're fucking crazy  If you'd want to eat  Something like that  I fucking eat that shit  We got one more 
[03:01:30]  And we're done with this list  Yeah  Number 11  Is your wife  Defending your life  In a fight  By grabbing your attacker's genitals  That's not allowed  If you do this  You're sinning  Yeah  How is it explained  In the Bible there  Deuteronomy 25  11 to 12  Deuteronomy  Oh boy  A Deuteronomy  Has he gotten a job yet  No  He's very upset  With you guys  Still  And me too  Yeah  Why is he upset with us

When did they  Shut down the program?  Who's second?  Do you know?  Like what's the guy  Doing who's second?  I don't know  Who did you beat out?  I don't know  And I won a little award  If that's what  They're calling me now  Whoa  Something  Give me a little trophy 
[03:20:30]  Or something  Artist of the millennium?  Artist of the millennium  Yeah  I'm just taking it out  Of the cake  Yeah  Dumb Michael Jackson  This is an honor  For Geneseo  I don't even really know  Who else went there  In our field  In entertainment  Or radio  Or TV  Richard Speck  Richard Speck  Probably  Right  I'm sure there's  A bit of a drop off  I'm sure there wasn't really  What about all those people  Sitting around that  Fucking mac and cheese table  True  Jim Chandler man  I wonder if he was in the running 
[03:21:00]  Jim Chandler  No because no one were  No one was jonesing  To go to Geneseo  I had an irresponsible family  That made me work my ass off  In school  But then tell  You know basically  They told us as seniors  Oh by the way  We have no money for college  Oh thanks  I'm like why the fuck  Did you make me work so hard  In high school then  Fuck  So then I was able  To get into Geneseo  At the last minute  For you know  I think at that time  It was like $500  A year or something  It was cheap 
[03:21:30]  Hey it all worked out  Huh  Now it's an amazing school  When I tell people  I went to Geneseo  They're like  Oh wow  Geneseo  Because it's drastically changed  Yeah  They call like  The Ivy League  School of the blah blah  By the lake  It's really hard  To get into now  Yeah  Really hard  But not back then man  It was like  Oh fuck  It was  Community college  It was the irresponsible  SUNY school  For all the people  That didn't get  Into any schools  Yeah  And they're like  It was a throwaway  I went to a throwaway college 
[03:22:00]  Can I say that today  When they interview me  Yeah it worked great though  No in the end  It worked fine  Yeah  I'm just saying  That's why  The competition  Wasn't stiff  Because you know  Yeah  People were going to  Syracuse  Was a big  Communication school  Yeah I mean  I don't think  Boston University  Was a biggie  But you're not going to  Win any awards in Syracuse  I mean everybody  In communications  Went to Syracuse  A lot right  Yeah Dick Clark  Went to Syracuse  You can't  There's no way  Yeah that's what  I'm trying to say  Dick Clark  A Dick Clark type of guy  Didn't go to Geneseo  No okay  No fuck no 
[03:22:30]  Okay  Everybody went to Syracuse  I'm flattered  But I don't know  How much of an honor  It really is  Let's get out of here  Alright  There was a fight room  But maybe we could do it tomorrow  Between who  Sal and Iraq  There's a fucking fight room  Between those two every day  What's going on  They never talk about it  Let's do it for a minute  Let's just give them  What's happening  You know Sam  Trying to find prizes  For what was it called again  Rock and reverse  Rock and reverse right  And yeah 
[03:23:00]  You kind of made it a little fun  You got a dumb Sudoku puzzle  That I signed  You got  Old Bullhorn  And then you  The punchline was  You just grabbed some of  E-Rock's shit  Which is funny  Personal items  But Sal doesn't understand  These weird boundaries  That we actually do have  On this show  They're strange  Granted  Right  But who wants to start  E-Rock  What's going on  Because you basically told me  You'll knock his fucking teeth out  What if he shrinks your sweater  Like his  Fucking medium  There's no fight brewing 
[03:23:30]  See what I mean  There really isn't though  You always make something  Out of nothing  This is why  I don't even bother  With these two  Why  Because there's always  It's like a fight  Behind the scenes  And they say some shit  And they talk shit  And they do shit  With each other's shit  And then the minute  You talk to them  On the air  They both of them  Just become complete pussies  And go  No everything's cool  Everything's fine  But there's really  Nothing going on  I said I would get  The headphones  Is everything cool  And Mel and I  No it's not  I haven't said anything yet  Thank you  Thank god for Eric Nagel 
[03:24:00]  Wow  What this was  Is I said  That I will punch Sal  In the teeth  If he goes through my bag  Why are you afraid  What are you afraid of  Because he said  He goes  Well you took the headphones  But I'm going to go  Through your bag  The one strapped to your mouth  And he goes  I'm going to go  Through your bag  Really  10.02  10.02 he goes  Feedback  It's probably the only reason  Why we stay late  Is to get one  One extra E-Rock  Fucking dig in  Well it is over time  So bonus 
[03:24:30]  Wow  Oh E-Rock  Comment  Sal you would go  Through his bag  Oh I have before  But that's completely  Against our boundaries  We have weird boundaries  Here but you don't  Fuck with people's  Personal shit  Yeah no  Eric  Eric  Fuck with my  Personal shit once  So I had to  Get back at him  For it  Eric  Do you clean  The head of your dick  As he fucked  To your shit  Sorry  Eric  Sorry Sal  Eric  Yes  What's going on 
[03:25:00]  You see  You see  Yeah see this is why  Who told me to do this  I don't know  I knew this wouldn't work  I knew this wouldn't work  E-Rock  What are you  Just say it  Not with these two  Why do you get so  I got pissed because  I mean that brush  I haven't used in forever  But still you go through my desk  And that kind of pisses me off  But then to say  I'm going to go through your bag  And take your shit  I don't  I'm not cool with that  Sam opened up your desk  And I said oh take the brush  So Sam took the brush  That's it  I didn't  He took your mouse pad  He took everything out 
[03:25:30]  But try to pin it off on me  As always Eric  Wow that could be a PSA  No I pinned on you  When you threatened me  I'm going to go through your bag  And you didn't even say anything back  So I didn't know  There was an apparent fight  I was in the other room  And I couldn't talk in there  While commercials were playing  If this was live on the air  I would have turned on the mic  And said something to you  You could easily talk back to the mic  So I would have heard you  This is stupid  I don't feel like bothering  With Eric right now  Wow  It excels above it  Oh fuck man  Wow what's going on here  See  These two sound like they're in love  They are  Because you know why 
[03:26:00]  They should fucking get it over with  Because Sal doesn't feel like  Messing with Eric right now  Right  But once they're off the air  He spends hours  Messing with Eric  Messing with Eric  It just keeps me occupied  Because he's in love with him  Are you in love with Eric  No but I do miss Eric  When he's not here  Would you be able to come with Eric  Would you  I'd definitely be able to  Are you a chubby chaser  If you had to suck one penis  On the staff  Who would you be  If you had to  It's a pure speculation  If you had to  I know you wouldn't  I'm just saying 
[03:26:30]  If you had to  If I had to  It's not in this room  I wouldn't  I just wouldn't do it  You're not answering the question  If you had to pick a penis  To suck on the staff  You got it  There's no not saying  If you don't answer  You're fired  I'd pick Eric  Roland would pick  Who's ever cock  Was out first  I don't know  Maybe  Maybe Sam  What  How awkward is it 
[03:27:00]  To sit there now  Do you understand  You never answer that question  You really got pushed in  We really had to twist his arm  Had his fingers crossed  He thinks I'm cute  Yeah Sam  I'm fucking  Enjoy that Sam  You deserve it  That's so uncomfortable  Picture that  I have to work here  Picture that  You never answer the question  I was kidding  Oh were you  I was kidding  I didn't mean it  When I sucked that cock  I didn't enjoy it  I was kidding  Oh god  Oh yeah I know 
[03:27:30]  Enjoy that one Sam  That's  The one's strapped to your mouth  He dropped  To my bag  The one's strapped to your mouth  Oh you heard him Travis  Yeah  That's weird right  Huh  Travis you never answer that question  As a guy right  Even if 
[03:28:00]  Even if someone goes  You're fired  If you don't answer  You just ignore all that  Right  Or you go like  Say something like  Wait like  Oh I'll suck every cock  In this room  Or whatever  But he thought about it  For a good  He did  Oh yeah  You know what got weird  He started looking at everybody  In the room  When he goes  Yeah he goes  We'd all take Sam  You know what  I guess I would take  And then he stopped himself  And he goes  No no no  Sam  Sam  And I go  Oh god  Come on  Enjoy that Sam  Take that with you  I won't  Enjoy it  Fucking chicken finger 
[03:28:30]  Crumbs all over his dick  And they're spreading on him  Yeah  Alright let's get out of here  What happened  No just a couple of  Cool pitches from people  Forget from Roland  Oh are they real though  Oh yeah  Real pitches  Can you say on air  Say them on the air  We're having fun  Yeah we like that  Slap  What do you got Ro  Slap  By the way people say  That Sunday Gravy  Needs an Opie and Anthony  Fucking promo code  Because they're buying up  The Sunday Gravy  We need to get a little 
[03:29:00]  Credit for that  So then they'll  Come back to us  Nice with some  More shit for us  So they'll come  And do more stuff  And not pay for  What do you mean  No promo code  They're not paying  For any advertising  Plugola  I know right  Plugola baby  I've had no promo code  How about you  Fucking advertise on our show  This late in my career  It's all about Plugola  I think they call them  To advertise too  Yeah  Are they going to  Or are they like  Well no  Opie will just keep  Mentioning our name for free  I sure will  Because he likes the sauce  Did you try the  Fucking eggplant  You'd be mentioning  Them for free too  No what's  What's the meatball place  Sunday Gravy

[03:30:00]  Two weeks later  He took on an  Advertiser  We're an idiot  I know  I mean you can  Take out an  Advertiser on  Satellite Radio  You can't take on  An advertiser  On regular radio  No way  You gotta make  Believe it's the  Greatest thing ever  When you're reading  That shit  Ain't no subscriptions  Coming in for  Fucking regular radio  I don't feel comfortable  With the Trojan Man  That's on my show  Tell your story  Walking  They fired him  They basically said  A condom's way more  Important than you  Than your ass

[03:31:00]  All day yesterday  I was too  I was just thinking  The amount of money  They're fucking losing  On that shitty food  I'll say it  I know I say it a lot  But I have to  It's mind boggling  Yeah  You're losing  85 million dollars a year  On shitty food  On a train  I gotta bring up a tweet  That came in yesterday too  Some fucking dolt  Actually said  Guys you got it wrong  They weren't  They didn't mean  The burgers cost 16 dollars  It was the burger  The overhead  Everything cost  So that the burger 
[03:31:30]  Averaged out  That each burger  Cost 16 dollars  For them  And they sold it  For 9 dollars  That's our point  When did we ever  When did we ever  Try to convey  Right  That the burgers  Themselves cost  The federal government  Taxpayers 16 dollars  Of course we meant  The overhead  The chef  The thing  That's what we said  The waste came from  That they could trim down  And bring the cost  Of the burger down  But it's a government  Fucking thing  So of course  There's a lot of waste  You fucking dolt  Whoever the fuck you were  Let him block you 
[03:32:00]  Damn it  What's going on Travis  Oh  Eric brought up  A good point  Do you guys want  A final tally  Let's get a final  I'm sure Val and Scott  Go live again  Vote result  Yes  Okay well  Yeah  With 1.3%  Of the vote  Last place  Would be  Monday  Okay  At 1.8%  Tomorrow  Okay  15.7%  Immediately  Okay  And with a whopping  81.2%

[03:34:30]  The Opie and Anthony show  Continues  This is After O&A Live  Here's your host  Sam Roberts  Yes indeed  After Opie and Anthony live  Very special guest today  The voice  The official voice  You're the voice  Of the WWE now right  That's what I call myself  Michael Cole  Exactly  It's here  That's self professed  By the way 
[03:35:00]  I'm so glad I'm here  Yeah  We've been wanting to do this  For a long time  Yeah but you live out in Texas  Yes  Which would be now  So Wrestlemania is on Sunday  Yes  You're here now  Yep  Are you here for the interim  For the entire week  I'll be here through next  Well Raw is actually  In Jersey as well  On Monday  So you're here  Then we head to Boston  So I'm here for  The duration  Full week  So is that  Do you like it  Because I would imagine  The traveling  You know everybody says  The craziest part  Of the whole gig  It's 52 weeks a year 
[03:35:30]  Yeah  We don't have an off season  But technically  Is this like  Even though you're away from home  Since you're not traveling  You're in one spot  For a week  It's worse  It is  Because I have to put up  With my wife  And listen to her complain  She stays  12 days  That I'm not home  Helping out with the dogs  And everything else  Yeah  But that's easier  Than like  Like I have to complain  I have to deal with my wife  Complaining about me  Not doing anything  But she's right there  Face to face  I'm sitting on the couch  And she's like  Why aren't you doing anything  I'd rather be face to face  Because it's worse on the phone  There's nothing like  You know  In the middle of the night 
[03:36:00]  And making the phone call  To say goodnight  And all of a sudden  Hey the hot water heater  Doesn't work  How do I turn the pilot light on  Yeah  Then I have to try to explain that  Although she knows  Yeah  Because she's better about  That house stuff  Than I am  Because she's home  She actually lives in the house  Exactly  She lives in the house  So that's the worst part  About the 12 days  Is not being there  And not being a part  Of all the stuff at home  But it's fun  I mean this is going to be  A really fun week  I can't wait  Is your wife just fed up with it  She's like  I don't want to see  Any more wrestling shows  She doesn't watch  Yeah  Number one  Yeah  Although she did watch  The only time she's ever 
[03:36:30]  Watched me on television  Was Wrestlemania  Two years ago  When I actually had a match  When you performed  You had a match  Yes I had a match  If you want to call it that  Yeah  It's been voted  One of the worst  Wrestlemania matches  In history Sam  You saw it  Of course I saw it  It was long  Long  It went the distance  I had never watched  It was me versus  Jerry the King Lawler  Wrestlemania 27  In Atlanta  And Jerry Lawler  Who's a legend  In this business  Had never ever  Had a Wrestlemania match  Ever  Yeah  So he's all excited 
[03:37:00]  Because he finds out  He's going to have  His first Wrestlemania match  And then he finds out  It's going to be  Against me  And he's sitting there  Like this is a great  This is a huge thing  My first Wrestlemania match  And you're like  Yeah mine too buddy  I'm the announcer  Exactly  So we do this whole angle  Leading up to the thing  Which was a lot of fun  The problem is  Is that  No one knew  That I had this  This orange  Singlet made  For this match  For this match  See I looked at you  Walking on the orange singlet  And you go  Because it's like  Michael Cole 
[03:37:30]  He's not  You know  He's not  He's in the shape  He's in good shape  For an announcer  Good shape  I mean I'm trying  To be polite  What are you looking at  He looked like  He had a  Like a spare tire  Tucked into his singlet  But I figured  That they might  And it was bright orange  Hey let me interrupt you  For one second  What's the Sirius what  Sirius 206  XM 105  Okay I'm tweeting out  To everyone that  I'm on your show  Right now  So  We're the only channel left  Exactly  That has two different numbers  That they wouldn't just consolidate 
[03:38:00]  So anyways  Although with you tweeting that out  That would probably just get hate for me  Because you  You are the only person  Who I would think  Gets more Twitter hate than I do  It's horrible  But it's actually better now  It's about 90% hate mailed out  It was 100% before  And then of course  Jerry went on  And had a heart attack  Live on television  And turned me into a baby face  Overnight  Right  You saved Jerry Lawler's life  By sitting next to him  Well I gave him a heart attack  In our match at Wrestlemania  That was the start of it  And then  So yeah  So you walk out  And it looks like 
[03:38:30]  You're in this bright orange singlet  And it looks like  Well let's not forget  I had the Team Cole sweatshirt  Of course  So I didn't reveal the singlet  Until I actually got in the ring  Although  Although you weren't wearing  Workout pants with it  You were just wearing  Your little orange shorts  With your big hoodie  Right  And my black  My black knee pads  In front of 70,000 people  At Georgia Dome  And I was scared to death  You were  Because I'd never been in a match before  Yeah  They sent me down a month early  And said hey  Go to Tampa to our training school  And learn how to take bumps  So they're throwing me around the ring  I couldn't move for two or two weeks  A month early 
[03:39:00]  Oh yeah  A month for a Wrestlemania match  And you're like alright  What is it March  Oh I guess it's in April  Yeah you can go down  Exactly  So  But I assumed  Watching you  Show up in front of 70,000 people  In a bright orange singlet  Not in great shape  That somebody had handed you that singlet  And was like  Oh I thought  This is going to be hilarious  I thought I was in great shape  I thought I was  Oh man  I thought I was Arnold  I really did  I figured  Because like  When they do stuff like that  Especially in WWE  All you guys  Or I thought 
[03:39:30]  And I wouldn't say you guys  But a bunch of guys  Who aren't wrestlers  Work out like they're wrestlers  So like when Vince McMahon  Had his first match  He takes off his  You know  Dumb three piece suit  And he looks like a bodybuilder  So I'm sitting there going  Oh I bet  You know  Cole is one of these workout guys  You're not  No  What happened was  And you have terrible tattoos  Thank you  There's a story behind that  Which I'll tell you in a second  But there's one of the  I'm one of these guys  Who thinks  They know how to work out  I've been going to the gym  For 15 years  Really? 
[03:40:00]  I haven't lost a pound  I do 45 minutes of cardio a day  I think it has something to do  With the beer and the whiskey  That I drink on a regular basis  But yeah  No seriously  So I think I'm in decent shape  Yeah  So then a couple of days  Before Wrestlemania  Hunter looks at me  And goes  Hey Michael  You've been hitting the gym  I said oh yeah  I've been going every day  And you think  You think Triple H  Is like complimenting you here  And he goes  Got me tips  So now when I  I realize he's not complimenting  I said  Well you know  I'm playing the character  I'm an announcer  I'm not supposed to be an athlete 
[03:40:30]  I'm supposed to look fat in the ring  That's the gimmick right  Meanwhile I'm so embarrassed  Because I've been working out  For months  To get ready for this match  And you have the audacity  To say  Triple H  I could be in wrestler shape  If I wanted to  But I don't want to make  Jerry the King Lawler look bad  No exactly  I didn't want to look better  Than the King  I don't want to make  Triple H  I don't want to make  You guys  Look bad out there  It was his moment  You know  I assumed that the  Singlet you were wearing  Was an exercise in humiliation  That was your choice  It was my choice  You had that made 
[03:41:00]  And everything  I wanted to do something  That was  I wanted to do something  That was  That was interesting  For Wrestlemania  And it was orange  A lot of people thought  It was orange  To pay homage  To my  My ex-partner Taz  It was actually orange  Because I went to Syracuse  That's what I thought  Because I went to Syracuse  Exactly  The orange mafia  Yeah  But how about those orange  Final four  I know  It's the only  Because I don't know  Anything about basketball  But I fill out the brackets  That doesn't surprise me  But I fill out  Well yeah  Because you look like  A real athlete  Because I fill out  The brackets  How many matches  Have you won 
[03:41:30]  I guess none  You've got one over me  I fill out the brackets  Based on  Like my final two  Were Syracuse  Because I went there  Okay  And Iona  Because I went to  High school  Right next to Iona  Oh my lord  And I couldn't believe  They were in the tournament  So I had them  Beating everybody  So of course  Iona loses in the first round  Which cuts off  That whole wing  Of the brackets  But then Syracuse  Actually made it  To the final four  So I'm looking okay  You should have  You know  Back to the singlet  For a second  Because I actually 
[03:42:00]  Had it made  So we have seamstresses  That travel with us  And I actually went  To the seamstress  And I said  Listen can you make  The singlet for me  And they looked at me  Like I had two heads  But nonetheless they did  And they took the measurements  And stuff  And so I was actually  In the bathroom  In the locker room  Actually sitting on the can  And one of the seamstresses  Wanted me to try  The singlet on  And she actually  Thought I was in changing  And I was dressed  And she walked in  While I was sitting  Bare naked on the can  And she saw a lot of things 
[03:42:30]  And handed me the singlet  To try on  Which I did  And I walked out  I'll never forget  I walked out of the bathroom  In the singlet  A week before Wrestlemania  And there were three people  Sitting in the room  John Cena  The Undertaker  And one of our  Talent relations guys  So the first two people  Two of the first three people  That actually saw me  In the singlet  Were two legends  In our business  The top two guys  And Undertaker  Looked at me and said  What has this business  Come to  And he walked out  Disgusted 
[03:43:00]  He left  That's why we haven't  Seen him since  Last Wrestlemania  And there was  There was a lot  There was a joke too  Because a lot of the guys  Had fun with  How it fit me  Around the groin area  Right  The sort of  Yeah that was a little  Embarrassing  Pelvic room  What kind of underwear  Do you wear with  Do you have to wear  A jock strap  Just a jock strap  That was it  Yeah  Did you put any  Padding into it  Or anything  It was funny too  Because at Wrestlemania  There's some shots  Where you can actually  See the straps  Of the jock strap  Outlined 
[03:43:30]  It was very unflattering  It's very amateur  I didn't remember much  Because after about  The first two minutes  Of that match  I thought I was  Knocked out by Jerry  And I was so  Completely out of breath  I don't remember  I never watched the match  Ever had  Ever watched the match  Until about  Two or three months ago  We were at a party  And somebody wanted  To put it on as a joke  And I watched it  And I could not believe  That it was 35 minutes long  Dude  Outrage  Wrestling fans  I said  You wasted 35 minutes  Daniel Bryan  Had an 18 second match  At Wrestlemania 
[03:44:00]  I had a 35 minute match  And that's what people  They put you  So how  How does somebody like you  Like it's obviously  Not your decision  How long your match goes  But they're doing a match  With Jerry the King Lawler  And an announcer  Michael Cole  And honestly  At this point  Jerry the King Lawler  Is basically an announcer  Himself  He's a wrestler  But he's an announcer  Right  So they've got the two announcers  And they're giving them  35 minutes  At the biggest pay-per-view  Are people back  Are wrestlers mad at you? 
[03:44:30]  People hated me  Yeah  I mean literally  There was like a backlash  In the locker room  Because you're taking  Their spot  This buffoon  Has got 35 minutes  On Wrestlemania  Now we tried to justify it  By saying  Hey Stone Cold  Steve Austin's  A special guest referee  This is a big attraction  Jack Swagger's at ringside  We have the coal mine  At ringside  The plastic box  That I used to broadcast from  Because I was a bad guy  It was just  Not a good scene  But  Yeah  And then  While they're sitting there  Pissed at you  For taking their spot  You're like 
[03:45:00]  You guys gotta see  The singlet that I had made  Is this how hoot or what?  The worst part about it was  I had like a five minute promo  Walking to the ring  Talking about this and that  And it was like  Oh my  I was boring myself  Walking out there  But I mean seriously  It was so much fun  It was a blast  Honor  To me  That was the most impressive part  That you walked out  In front of  Like you said  70,000 people  And you're just on mic  And you're talking the whole time  That's the one thing  It's like what you do  I mean you can talk non-stop  Because you do it for a living  That's what I do for a living  So that was the most comfortable part 
[03:45:30]  Of the entire evening for me  Was being able to talk  So when you're out  So they're not giving you a script  No  Not  Because at this point  You know what you're doing  Bullet points  You get bullet points  Of what they want you to hit  But that was basically my baby  They basically said  You've been doing  You've been talking about this match  For three months  Go out there  Hit a home run  And let's do it  Was that your favorite thing  That you've ever done  Oh my god  Yes  Yeah  I mean I  You know I cursed the fact  That Jerry Lawler  Had a heart attack  Because it made me  Turn into a good guy  That was the number  That was the worst thing  About the heart attack  Well I'll tell you a story  By the way  866-WOW1-WOW 
[03:46:00]  We can go to phones too  Jerry  Obviously  What we were talking about  Was back in September  Jerry actually  Had a heart attack  On the air  Right  On Monday Night Raw  We were in Montreal, Canada  We were calling a match  And Jerry and I  We don't look at each other  When we work  We have monitors  At ringside  It's gotten there  Huh  Exactly  Can't stand the sight  Of each other  I look at my right monitor  Jerry looks at his left monitor  And we were calling a match  And all of a sudden  I heard Jerry snoring  I thought that he was just 
[03:46:30]  Like doing that  To say that the match  Was boring  Right  Which would he  Is that something  I used to do it  When I was a bad guy  So I just figured  Maybe he was doing it  So I turned around  To look at him  And you know  He was snoring  And then I said  This isn't right  And his head was on the table  Next thing I knew  He went into cardiac arrest  So you know  Thank God  For the doctors  And the EMTs  And Jerry you know  Made it  That had to be  The scariest thing  You've ever seen  Oh my god  And I've been  I worked at CBS News  Before I worked  In this business  You know  We always talk about  I always say on the air 
[03:47:00]  Especially when I was a bad guy  That you know  I'm a former war correspondent  And a broadcast journalist  But that's true  I've covered wars  Which wars did you cover?  I was in Bosnia  I did three tours in Bosnia  Sarajevo  And I was involved in Kuwait  In the first Persian Gulf War  Did a number of different things  So I've been involved in all kinds of different things  From the news business  But this is actually something that really affected me  Because it was one of my real good friends  Who I've been working with for 15 years  And he's right next to you  Exactly  And I just 
[03:47:30]  Plus I would think  You know  When you go to cover war  You're expecting like some crazy shit could happen  Yeah and you're not personally invested  And you don't know anybody that's involved  You're a reporter  You're not personally invested in the story  Yeah  Like when you're Michael Cole  And you're sitting at ringside  Calling raw  Right  You know  You kind of would like to think  That you have some idea  Of what's going to happen  And then you have to explain to the world  That this isn't  Yeah  Part of the show  This is real life  And you're a bad guy at that time  Right  Well I was  So like theoretically  You're like 
[03:48:00]  Yeah yeah  I hope he has a heart attack  I had to break character  Yeah  You know  And then the news background  Came in  Long story short  Jerry made it  Thank God  And he's better today  And better shaped today  Than he's ever been in his entire life  But he said he died  For a second right  Yes  That's what he claims  Wow  Yeah I mean  I mean you're not a doctor  Exactly  Whether you believe that  Or you don't  Whatever he saw  He said he didn't see any light  He said it was completely pitch black  Until he woke up  Yeah  So we know where he's going  When it's all over  But he  He's lived a good life though  Hasn't he  Exactly  So on Wednesday 
[03:48:30]  I remember  This happened on Monday  On Wednesday  Jerry  His girlfriend  Had called me  From the hospital  In Montreal  And said listen  Somebody wants to talk to you  And I  You know  Jerry's on the phone  Holy shit  Jerry Lawler  You had a heart attack  Two days ago  And this was like  And when they were reporting  This heart attack  It was like  We don't know what's going to happen  This was a bad one  I was told by my producers  Probably about a half hour  If it happened  That listen Michael  You've got to really  Make sure that you're prepared 
[03:49:00]  To deliver the worst  Wow  So now all this stuff's going on  I'm trying to forget  Get all situated in my head  How I'm going to  So in your head  You're thinking how you deliver this  Exactly  That's exactly what I was thinking  And then going off the air  It was almost like it was  I hate to say this  It was almost like it was scripted  Because going off the air  We got the news in  At the last moment  That Jerry was hanging in there  And the news looked better  So that Wednesday  He actually calls me  And he says  Hey Michael  It's Jerry  And I'm like  Hey King  I can't believe you're here  You're alive 
[03:49:30]  And we talked for a few seconds  And I just said  I just want to tell you something  Thanks for ruining my heel run  Yeah that was it  That was baby face again  The whole thing  And that's where the money is too  You're not making money  From Wrestlemania matches  Hey look at those guys in the ring  Being a bad guy  Is the greatest thing in the world  It is  It really is  It is so much fun  It's easy  And that's a little more natural of you  Isn't it  Of course it is  You know me well  You know me off the air  Yeah exactly  Evil Michael Cole comes out  That's after some of those whiskeys though  Here is the question 
[03:50:00]  That I was wondering  A few weeks ago  After all this  You see you know  You watch this guy  Have this heart attack  He falls down  They bring him back  He comes back  It's a miraculous thing  So what's he doing  Eating tater tots on TV  You know how many tweets  I got about that  I would imagine  We were doing a promotional bit  For Sonic  Who's a great sponsor  Of WWE  And they have been for years  And you know  Jerry was eating  One of their new items  And my Twitter  Blew up that night  Because  Hey Cole  The guy's had a heart attack 
[03:50:30]  I was going to see you once  And now he's eating fried food  And Lawler is sitting there  Stuffing his face  With tater tots  He had five of them  In his mouth at once  I go  This was months ago  Not years ago  Nope  But he  According to Jerry  The doctors say  He can eat  And do whatever he wants  That he's in better shape  And health now  Than he was before  The heart attack  You don't think about Jerry  Jerry has never smoked  No  He's never drank  And  But he does cage matches  At 60  And eats tater tots  Exactly  And he wants to wrestle again  He does  He does  He loves it  Would Vince put him  In the ring again  I don't have any idea 
[03:51:00]  I don't have any idea  And you're not going to  Get me to go there either  Because I don't have  Any idea what they're thinking  Well I will say  Because in my mind  The human in me  Would say  No I would never put  Jerry Lawler in the ring  But I think Vince  Oh god damn yeah  We'll put him back in the ring  He's a promoter  Yeah  So who knows  As long as you can get  Jerry Lawler on TV  Before he goes in there  To say  I want to do this  Right  My hands are clean  On this one  Exactly  Yeah  Exactly  Let me go to  Brian in Long Island 
[03:51:30]  Who's on with Michael Cole  What's up Brian  What's up Michael  Hey Brian  Listen there's a famous  Thing on YouTube  Called WWE  Off the air  Where you and Jerry  Just absolutely  Destroy the ring announcer  Which ring announcer was it  I bet it was  Tony Chimble  I don't know his name  But I mean  You guys are just brutal  Has he ever confronted you  About that  No  You know  I think it was  Tony Chimble  And I think it had to do  With a  Smackdown taping  A number of years ago  Where Tony could not 
[03:52:00]  Figure out that the name  Of the match was a  Turkey  Bowl match  And that it was for the  Women's  Not women's  Championship  That woman's  Exactly  And I swear to god  Chimble  About 10 or 11 times  Had to do these lines  Wild lines we call them  To try to get it right  And Jerry and I  Lambasted him  Like there was no tomorrow  I'll never forget that night  Tony Chimble's a great guy  I've been with the company  For like 30 years  I still have no idea  How he's been here that long  But somebody else  Sent me a YouTube clip  Because that's so funny 
[03:52:30]  That he was talking about that  Because somebody else  Was like  When we were tweeting  Last night  That you know  That you were going to  Come on the show today  Somebody was like  Oh you gotta ask Cole  About when he was  Fucking with Tony Chimble  And so I clicked  His YouTube video  And it was a totally  Different one  It was like  Some  He described a ladder match  But he said  Oh  First person to get  Custody  Of the belt  But it's on pay-per-view  And you just start  Openly laughing  Like  Custody  What is he talking about  Chimble's been doing this  For how long 
[03:53:00]  I can't say anything though  Because it's difficult  I butcher things  Every week  Well you can  At live television  Don't say I can't say anything  Because you say things  And then you go back  Yeah but it's all good  But you've already said the things  I know exactly  It's live TV  Welcome aboard  I mean it's funny  You have  What they call in wrestling  Buried a lot of people though  You go out there  Even now as a good guy  I've heard you  Like weeks ago  You're still  If you don't think  A segment is going well  Or whoever doesn't think  A segment is going well  Your voice 
[03:53:30]  Will be there  Like  Jericho was doing a segment  A few weeks ago  Oh god please  And you start  You start saying  Cut to commercial  Cut to commercial  This is horrible  I got in so much trouble  You literally  Because  They're doing this  Like interview segment  On Raw  And Michael Cole  Is sitting there  At ringside  And he is saying  He's openly laughing  While these guys  Are talking  Not wrestling  And then you  Start requesting  That the show  Cut to commercial 
[03:54:00]  Yes  Because it was  A very bad segment  But what I felt bad about  Is the fact that  I disrespected Chris  Who obviously  Has been in this  Business longer than I have  And you know  He's one of the  Legendary greats  Of all time  And more importantly  Than all that  Chris is a friend of mine  Right  And so I actually  And he's going to be in here  On Thursday  So whatever you say today  Actually believe it or not  I felt bad  And yeah  I felt bad  For a number of reasons  A because I did that  I didn't feel bad at the time  I felt bad afterward 
[03:54:30]  But because I didn't go to Chris  And explain to him  What happened  Yeah  So he had to hear it  Like through the grapevine  The next day  So he wasn't happy with me  Yeah because he can't hear  So it's like  We ironed things out  Chris and I did  But he's a great guy  But you know  That's funny  But you've been in the company  For longer than most  Of the wrestlers now  16 years  Jesus Christ  Yes  That makes me think  I've been watching  Way too long  Because I remember  Like when you were  The new backstage dude  16 years  And I was like  What happened  Oh yeah  When I had the goatee 
[03:55:00]  Of the frosted tips  And all that  Yeah  When you were like  The young guy  Who was taking like  Sean Mooney  And Todd Pettengill  Like your size skinny  Yeah  I did take Todd Pettengill  Actually Todd Pettengill  Got me my job  He did  He helped get me my job  I gotta tell you something  We don't make fun of him  For wrestling  But his radio show  Does not get an easy time here  I know  You're aware  Actually  My first job  Out of college  That's Todd Pettengill  By the way  From Scott and Todd  He was also  He worked for WWE  A while back  My first job out of college  Was with Todd 
[03:55:30]  In Albany, New York  Really?  Fly 92  It was the Todd  Wake up service  Or something  And it was Todd  Jim Chandler  And myself  You worked with Jim Chandler?  Yes  Oh my god  He rocked  Are you hearing this?  Yeah  Jim Chandler  You gotta hear this story  About Jim Chandler  Because Jim Chandler  Has been a running storyline  On the O&A show  Okay  We do a thing called  Jocktober  Every October  Where we make fun  Of a different radio  You're aware  Oh yeah  We make fun of radio shows  And I just  I mean nobody is safe 
[03:56:00]  But I don't have any  I don't know any of these radio shows  I just start googling like  You know  Top 40 Arkansas  And I look for shows  And they're that random  Right  So I bring one in  And  Oh jeez  It's Jim Chandler's show  But I don't know who Jim Chandler is  Right  And so I give these guys  The tape  And it's like  You know  Whoever  It's like Woody and Jim  Or whatever the name of the show was  And  They're  They're  You know  I actually think you're right  I think it was Woody  Okay  I think he was  They're playing the clips 
[03:56:30]  Shitting all over them  Like they're Tony Chimmel  They're just  Destroying everything they do  And I start pulling up  The website  Of like  To show  Opie and Anthony and Jim  Who these guys are  Right  And Opie looks at the  At the computer  And he goes  Oh no  And we go  What  And he goes  I gotta tap out of this one  But he's already  He's like you  He's like  I don't want to say anything  After he's already said everything  Exactly  Because  He's like Jim  He goes  Jim Chandler  And I go  Yeah  And he goes 
[03:57:00]  We were in Geneseo together  Just trying to make names  For ourselves  In radio  It's classic  We were the two of us  We were just  We were sitting there  Like in the summer  And we were both  And I became this  And now I'm just sitting there  Making fun of his show  Without even realizing it  Well he's this little short guy  With glasses  Or at least he was  I mean I haven't seen him  In 20 years  But he was the  He was  He and Todd  Were like the hosts  And I was like  You know  Funny news guy  That delivered the news headlines  And then  Did you have to be  A little wacky 
[03:57:30]  Yeah  And then I  I am looking for air checks  You gotta  Yeah  Cause E-Rock in there  Is like  Fly 92  I would have worked there  With Todd  In the wake up service  From  89 to 91  He's like how I am  With wrestling  He is with radio  So he'll find the air checks  It was 89 to 91  I did all that  Goofy stupid minute  You know  Update of news  And then  I sat there  Was the laugh track  For the show  Much like I do  On Raw now  When somebody says a joke  And I go  That was good  That's what I did then  Yeah  So that was before  Scott Shannon 
[03:58:00]  Cause we always say  Scott Shannon  Stole Todd  Yeah  From Jim  And then ruined  Jim Chandler's career  He did  Cause Scott and Todd  Went on to be this big  New York show  Because Todd Pangail  As much as we bust his balls  For what he does  He does it well  Funny story is  In 1996  When I was working for CBS  I actually went back to Albany  To cover a breakfast  When I was covering Steve Forbes  On the presidential campaign  And we were at a little coffee house  In Albany  And I'm sitting there  And we're covering Forbes  Doing a speech  Or whatever  Hell he was doing 
[03:58:30]  And all of a sudden  This guy comes up behind me  And goes  Sean  That's my real name  And he goes  I haven't seen you in years  I turn around  It's Jim Chandler  What are you doing  I'm working for some  Small station here in Albany  And he goes  And then I never forget  He said  Well Todd's in New York  And you're at CBS  And I'm still here  At this little station  In Albany  Oh no  You're right  Did you have a radio question  Well you just  I was going to ask  What was the mood  When all of a sudden  Shannon just kind of  Took Pettengill  The story is that 
[03:59:00]  Todd took the job  And then was going to leave  And then said  Oh yeah I'm leaving for New York  And left everybody  Kind of fucked  I was actually gone by then  He left  Todd actually  You left while the getting  Was still good  It was right around the time  Todd was leaving  Todd and I were actually close  And Todd had given me  A little bit of an inkling  That he may be moving on  And I said  Okay time for me to go  And I just happened to  Get hired in Houston  For the CBS affiliate there  And I ended up picking up  And moving to Texas  Which is why I'm there today  And about two or three weeks later  Todd called me and said 
[03:59:30]  Hey I'm going to New York  If you ever need a job  Let me know  So it was  That's how that went  And then he got you  The job at WWE  Yeah he was working  You know doing whatever  He was doing  On camera work  And stuff like that  And he gave me a call  And said hey  They're looking for an announcer  My deal was up at CBS  At the time  This was back in late 96  Early 97  And he had me come in  For an audition  And I did it  And the rest is history  As they say  So you go from  How long was it between  You go from being like  A news guy  Who's covering the Bosnian war  And like for real stuff 
[04:00:00]  To The Rock is putting  T-shirts on your head  Like two weeks  Yeah that was it  That was the transition  I had just come off  The  I had just finished  The  96 presidential campaign  I was with Dole  For the entire campaign  And I had just finished  The campaign  When this gig came up  So I just came off  Covering a year long  Presidential campaign  With Bob Dole  From the Republican Party  And Steve Forbes  Before that  And I go to work  For WWE  And my first interview  Was with Savio Vega 
[04:00:30]  And Los Barricos  In a barn  In Des Moines, Iowa  They were like  We want you to  You're going to interview  This Puerto Rican gay  In a barn  And at which point  My wife  This is back when she watched  And she said to me  What the hell  Are you doing  Yeah  Did you want to  Get out of news  I don't understand the move  Yeah it was  There was too much travel  I was homeless  Than I am now  There was too much travel  So I joined WWE  Which is notorious  For a home life  And in the down time  I got sick of covering 
[04:01:00]  Potholes in Manhattan  And snow storms  And so I figured  It'd be fun  My deal was  Hey listen  I'm going to get  A year or two  Of television experience  Because I was working  In radio  And then I'll just  Go back and  Get a great TV news job  And be on  Good Morning America  One day  And I never left  Now you're stuck  With JBL  And watching  George Stephanopoulos  On TV  Let me go to  Ryan in the Bronx  What's up guys  What's up Ryan  Hi  Michael  I got to commend you  Number one  It's always tough 
[04:01:30]  To be the guy  After the guy  And you know  I'm almost 40 years old  So I grew up  With Gorilla  And Jesse  And then J.R.  Of course  But for you to take over  After J.R.  Like everybody gives you shit  But I think you do  A real good job man  And you carry that show  A lot of the times  But I just want to  Throw a name out there man  I see it in your face  Sometimes on the show  It's painful to watch  Brad Maddox is horrible  On the mic  I actually like Brad  I think he's got  Some potential down the road  He's like a lot of 
[04:02:00]  Our guys today  The business is changing  And it really is  We've got a lot of  Young guys  We've got a great  Minor league facility  We like to call it  Down in Florida  Called NXT  We've got a lot of  Young talent down there  You're going to see  A shifting to the guard  We have to do it  I mean you see  What's going on  At Wrestlemania  A lot of these guys  Aren't going to be around  In a week or two  We've got a great  Great show at Wrestlemania  You know Rock Cena  And Brock Lesnar  Yeah we should probably  Mention that before  We run out of time  Yeah  And you know  We've got all these guys  That are there  And Punk and Undertaker 
[04:02:30]  Of course  Do you like the  Paul Bearer stuff?  I love it  But again I'm a heel at heart  So  Right  But that's what's  Supposed to be done  Do you know who  Michelle Beadle is?  Yes  She's first of all  Not a Michael Cole fan  I know  She's a wrestling fan  I know I follow her Twitter  She was in here yesterday  And I go yeah  Michael Cole is coming  Michael Cole  Why would you have him on?  I love it  Hey as long as they know my name  Yeah  It doesn't matter to me  That's true  I mean they don't know  You're not just an anonymous announcer 
[04:03:00]  But you know  We've got a lot of young kids  On the horizon  We're going to have to start  Going that direction  And it's an exciting time  For our company  But Wrestlemania  I am so excited  I cannot wait  You're going to be there  Yes I'm definitely going to be there  75,000  MetLife Stadium  Rock Cena  You know which is pretty cool  Because we get a lot of  Mainstream press coverage  Out of this  Because Rock of course  Yeah but what's up  With The Rock  Going on like  The Tonight Show  And GMA  And just talking about G.I. Joe  Like why not put the belt  On your shoulder  And mention Wrestlemania  Once or twice  And again I don't know  I'm just assuming  That those appearances 
[04:03:30]  Were booked by G.I. Joe  And their press junket  And they might have just said  Talk about the movie  Who knows  But he did go on Kimmel  And talk about  You know WWE  And he obviously  Was on Michael and Kelly  Talking about it  Presented Michael Strahan  With a championship  So I don't know  How all that's handled  But all I know  Is that it's great for us  We're going to get  A ton of mainstream publicity  Out of this  Because you've got  One of the biggest movie stars  In the world right now  The number one movie  Worldwide in G.I. Joe  And he's defending  The WWE championship  Against the guy  Who's been here  And carried this company  For ten years 
[04:04:00]  And John Cena  Dude I was watching last night  John Cena got booed  Out of the building  Not surprised  You said he had a mixed  You were like  He's having a mixed reaction  This crowd's a  Yeah there's a reason  That I said that  Which I don't need  To get into now  But maybe  Maybe there was some sound  That was blocking  Your hearing in the arena  I don't know  I think I had my earplugs in  But you know  John  Listen  Rock's fresh  Yeah  He's here  And he's not here  And people  John's here every week  And he's in the trenches  Every week 
[04:04:30]  And I think that people  People like fresh  Do you think they should  Turn John Cena  Into a full-fledged heel  I don't  You don't think so  I don't think so  And I know that a lot of people  Are like  Oh you don't know  What the hell you're  Talking about Cole  He drives our company  I mean he's been here  Ten years  People love him  Kids love him  There's nobody close  That sells the amount  Of merchandise  That John sells  I mean he is just  So good for this brand  And not to mention  The charity that John does  I mean between  Make-A-Wish  And the Susan G. Komen  For the Cure  The Breast Cancer Foundation  That we worked heavily  With them last year 
[04:05:00]  That was all John's idea  He came up with the pink ropes  And the whole nine yards  So you know  Just for those reasons alone  John needs to stay who he is  And that's who he is at heart  John is that person  At heart  I've known John for years  He's one of my closest friends  In the business  And that's who he is  How much has WWE  And the locker room  And everything changed  Since when you joined  It was full on  Like Attitude Era  Stone Cold Rock  All this was going on  Right  It's completely different  It is  It's such  It's a business 
[04:05:30]  This is a business now  It is  Not that it wasn't before  But this is a business  You know  Suits and ties  You've had a lot of our guys  In here  Yeah  You know  Most of them  Especially like Miz  Miz is like one of the  Sharpest dressed guys  I'm afraid that Miz  Is going to end up broke  Because he's spending  All his cash  On like  Four piece suits  For radio appearances  This is a  You know  We're a publicly traded  Company on Wall Street  We're a global entity  We're on it  In 150 different countries  You know  TV  Every Monday  And Wednesday  And Friday night  And the internet  And all our social media 
[04:06:00]  We are a conglomerate  And the beauty  Of our superstars  And divas today  Is that they treat it that way  This is a business for them  You know  They go to work  Like it's a  You know  A nine to five job  So to speak  In their suits and ties  And their  Their beautiful dresses  And you know  They sell the company  For what they need to  And it's just  It's a completely  Different atmosphere  Than it was 15 years ago  Is it  Do you think  Is it more fun  Less fun  Or  I always have fun  You know  And just like  I'm sure you complain  About your job  We all complain  About our jobs  But when the red light  Goes on 
[04:06:30]  And it's show time  That is so much fun  Like at DC last night  On Raw  When that red light  Goes on  It is the greatest job  In the world  And you know  It's funny  You were talking  About Todd Pettengale  You know  You had a relationship  With him  He was doing his thing  At WWE  And he goes  Hey they're looking  For somebody new  Why don't I  Why don't I  Introduce you to the guys  Well I'm going to  Tell you something  I met Michael Cole  A while back  And he goes  Yeah we're always  Looking for new people  And I sent him  My tape  Pictures  Shook hands  With a bunch of people  And the info  That he got back 
[04:07:00]  Was  Yeah look at him  What the fuck  Are we going to do  With someone  Who looks like that  He's not an announcer  That is a true story  Wait  Is that not at all  What we're looking for  That is a true story  Tell him to  Not let the door  Hit him where the  Good Lord split him  It might have been  The hair perhaps  That had something  To do with it  But I can't  How's your wife  By the way  She's good  Great tell her  I said hi  But that's  I asked you  About your wife  Putting up with wrestling  Because I mean  She won't  Put up with that at all  We came full circle  Didn't we  Yeah  She  No  My wife won't  Put up with it at all 
[04:07:30]  She went to  One Wrestlemania  Was it the one  You performed at  No  She didn't  She wasn't  Interesting  That was the only time  She's ever really  Watched the program  She actually watched it  She texted me  When it was over with  It wasn't like  How you doing  You know  Are you okay  Are you sore  It was like  That was pathetic  That's the text  My wife sent me  After Wrestlemania  But no I mean  You know she supports  The product obviously  She's you know  She's not a fan  But she supports  What I do  Well she also probably  Doesn't have to deal  With supporting  A shelf full of  Pro wrestling action figures  Like some people's wives do 
[04:08:00]  I've got my own room  That she said  That's yours  And that's where  I've got all my  Memorabilia  And but no  She you know  She she appreciates  The company  For what it is  And my wife  Had a kidney transplant  A decade ago  And when that happened  This company  Was so wonderful  Really  I mean just  Unbelievably fabulous  You never hear those stories  From the top down  From Mr. McMahon  Down through  Through his entire family  And because of that  You know  She has always  Respected and loved  Everybody that's been  Involved in this company  It's just not her cup of tea 
[04:08:30]  Well on that note  We gotta let Ron Fez  Take over  Wrestlemania is Sunday  MetLife Stadium  People can't get tickets  Anymore can they  No I mean  You keep checking in  Because they may  Release some stuff  But it's on pay per view  So check it out  And you know  There's wrestling stuff  Going on all weekend  Michael Cole  Thank you for being here  Sam thanks for having me  Alright Ron and Fez  Are up next  Goodbye
