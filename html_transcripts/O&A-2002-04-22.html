<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a somber discussion of Layne Staley's death, criticizing the lack of New York radio coverage compared to Cleveland.  They played Alice in Chains' "Nutshell," reflecting on Staley's struggles with addiction and comparing him to other musicians like Scott Weiland. Numerous listener calls followed, sharing grief and criticism of the radio's response.  One caller linked Alice in Chains' "Don't Follow" to suicide. The hosts then boasted about their exceptionally high ratings in Philadelphia, receiving confirmation and figures from a station manager phone call,  contrasting this with the initial negative Philly listener reaction.  Their appearance in gossip columns was also discussed, including a recent segment featuring Kathleen Turner at a performance of *The Graduate*.

The show then transitioned to its studio guest, Glorianne, a model, who was the focus of much of the broadcast.  The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive banter with Glorianne, frequently commenting on her physical attributes.  Her upcoming role in the film "The Curse of the Komodo Dragon," featuring topless scenes, and her family's modeling history were also mentioned. A significant part of the show documented Glorianne's topless walk down Broadway, accompanied by two men in Opie and Anthony "WOW" shirts, to promote the show. This stunt was discussed live, with updates on her progress, onlookers' reactions, and the eventual police intervention leading to Glorianne covering herself.

The program further included a review of an HBO special on prostitution, featuring explicit listener accounts and anecdotes, including detailed discussions of sexual acts, pricing, and client interactions.  A caller identified as "Keith the Cop" described his undercover work posing as both client and sex worker.  Another caller from Philadelphia received OzFest tickets for contributing to the high ratings. Sandy Kane, promoting her appearance on the show's "Cribs" series, performed an explicit song about Robert Blake, interspersed with comedic interjections and marshmallow-throwing by the hosts.  Gloria Ann (who seems to be the same as Glorianne), another guest, participated in studio conversations and a photo shoot, with the promise of extensive video footage (including topless scenes and bathroom usage) being posted on foundrymusic.com.  This video footage also included a photoshoot by Rick.  They also hoped to avoid any pictures of singer Sandy Cain surfacing online.

Listener calls continued throughout the broadcast, using humor and explicit language, covering topics including stories about encounters with "Keith the Cop," sexual acts and pricing, a cancerous wart, a near-fire incident involving flaming marshmallows and Gloria Ann's wig, and a workplace accident involving a fire alarm.  The hosts gave away Blade II soundtracks and repeatedly emphasized the availability of the Glorianne/Gloria Ann video footage on their website.  The hosts also discussed Robert Blake and a psychic communicating with the dead. The broadcast ended abruptly, with the hosts acknowledging needing to catch up on the material covered.  The entire show employed highly explicit and offensive language throughout.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  and welcome to the opie anthony show starting the show a little uh a little differently today  i'm bummed man i know we're both bummed because uh yeah we've said in many many interviews that  allison chains is one of our favorite bands of all time and uh and uh lane passed away uh like  two weeks ago they're now saying yeah oh uh at first they thought at first they thought he died 
[00:00:30]  like friday and now the latest news is that he may have been dead for like two weeks in his apartment  two weeks i found out over the weekend and i gotta be honest i was really really really bummed out  yeah allison chains one of my faves and i know uh allison chains one of uh ants faves absolutely  and i gotta tell you man radio blows radio absolutely blows because when i found out  that lane staley uh died i uh i immediately started you know flipping around the radio 
[00:01:00]  to to try to get some info try to get uh i don't know maybe uh a little feel for what uh is going  on in radio as far as his death's concerned or maybe uh just find a place where i can hang a  little bit because i'm a huge allison chains fan you know yeah and uh the radio didn't do it for me  so then i'm uh i'm all weekend long i'm like tuning in mtv like crazy mtv2 and all they could  give us is like a little scroll at the bottom of the screen that's it yeah for one of uh the greatest  voices of the 90s hell yeah in my opinion the the the best singer of the 90s and everyone knows how 
[00:01:30]  huge i'm i'm into uh nirvana and kurt cobain yeah but i think lane had even a better voice than kurt  cobain and i couldn't get i couldn't get crap from our our local rock stations here in new york  nothing no they milked the hell out of him in the band when uh they were really on top and  putting albums out and stuff but then uh you know a couple years goes by he dies and they just kind  of blow it off or goof on it or something right i mean in new york you could get at least five or six  radio stations that uh definitely played allison chains a lot so i'm figuring out of the five or 
[00:02:00]  six someone will do something didn't do crap i heard one station playing man in the box a million  times and goofing on the fact that he's dead and that was about it i remember back when uh kurt cobain  died yeah and pretty much uh uh uh the radio stations just gave up their programming yeah well  also you know he was at the top of his game when uh when he did it yeah i guess you know you got a  guy like lane who hung out in in misery for a few more years and uh people don't pay as much attention 
[00:02:30]  i just think rock radio in general just missed a great opportunity you claim to you know play all  the all the music of today and you mix in the allison chains and stuff to to you know uh have a good  radio station out there and uh you try to live like quote the lifestyle and then then a huge figure of  uh the 90s and the grunge rock scene uh passes away and your station has nothing yeah to say  nothing to say just proving that you're really just a jukebox playing you know the latest songs 
[00:03:00]  that are out there well they got to get their uh their um the bands on that uh that the record  companies shove on the uh on the radio stations you know they got to do that it's all the programming  lists that they got to play and everything get those on perish the thought you blow off some of that  uh for uh some alice in chains and then if the best you could do is play man in the box over and  over again all weekend long and have your dj's goof you're pretty pathetic as a radio station look 
[00:03:30]  man and i like to goof on everything and you want to take your shots uh at lane staley and alice in  chains go for it man you know we'd be called hypocrites if we didn't allow you to do that but  if you're a radio station and that's all you got it's pretty pathetic it's pretty pathetic why don't  you just uh admit that you're just a jukebox and you have nothing nothing to offer your listeners  yeah when it comes down to it so we figured we'd start the show today with uh uh a nutshell from  jar of flies anthony very appropriate tune very haunting very dreary it's raining here in new york 
[00:04:00]  i i'm sure a bunch of people have just killed themselves you listen to you listen to the words  and uh you know you can kind of get a little feel about what was going on in his head yeah for sure  real fast i mean i'll read the lyrics of the song real fast uh we chase misprinted lies we face the  path of time and yet i fight and yet i fight this battle all alone no one to cry to no place to call  home my gift of self is raped my privacy is raked and yet i find and yet i find repeating in my head 
[00:04:30]  if i can't be my own i'd feel better dead well there you go the saddest thing is that he uh went  what three weeks was it two weeks or three weeks that they're starting to say it could be up to two  weeks that he's been dead how many people do you know that can just lock themselves in somewhere for  two weeks and no one will notice or bang on the door or call and get worried here's a guy that you  know millions of people bought the albums listened to the music enjoyed the hell out of it and um 
[00:05:00]  you know you fast forward to uh a couple of weeks ago and no one even noticed he was gone missing  apparently everyone gave up on this guy if you wanted it that way you know whatever god bless i'm not  gonna say you know you what intervention everyone should have jumped in knock the door down you know  it seems they were fed up with them they got to the point where they tried as much as they could 
[00:05:30]  maybe that's the case but that's the saddest part is that you know here's a guy and two weeks go by  there's nobody that should be in a position where weeks can go by and no one will knock on your door  i was thinking a call or something i was thinking god forbid if i was in that situation i'm thinking  how long would i last before someone would discover i'd maybe go a weekend you think a weekend tops but  by monday morning i mean yeah someone's finding me someone's not two weeks 
[00:06:00]  yeah so that's you know it's just uh it it kind of lets you in a little more on what he was about  you know the guy either either he chased everyone out of his life to the point where he could die and  not be found for two weeks or the other end maybe the people in his life weren't really friends or  family or committed enough to uh try to help the guy out i tend to think the guy might have been an 
[00:06:30]  asshole to everybody and decided um you know that he wasn't going to uh listen to anybody and  he just figured he wanted to die and that was it well you know he was pretty much shot since like  93 yeah you know they kind of got him together so they could do that unplugged thing back in what  96 i think yeah and then he did a version of uh another brick in the wall right lane did which was  an unbelievable version but that's pretty much it for almost 10 years i mean he's been useless 
[00:07:00]  and but as uh being a huge allison chainspan it was always in the back of my head hey man  you know you've heard other bands you know get it all together and get their lead singer back  i'm thinking eventually man something is going to pop they're going to be able to uh  you know uh clean them up and get some more albums out yeah i i've always had that hope in the back of  my head but when i found out i was just so bummed and then that tuning in the radio here in new york  because a lot of stations that were on are saying hey man like cleveland i give props to cleveland i guess uh 
[00:07:30]  the station we're on in cleveland did a full hour vows and chains and taking phone calls and having  the jocks talking stuff but here in new york not one station not one station had anything  yeah and that really bummed me out uh leon from cleveland wrote this uh email uh we have lots to  do on the show today but this is the the way we chose to start today's show leon from cleveland  writes i'm sad even though i never met lane i feel empty inside 420 will forever be remembered as a day  of sorrow day of mourning the day i lost all hope for my favorite band i always felt that they were 
[00:08:00]  finished but as long as they were alive i had hope when i heard the news it came from a friend who  could on who could understand my loss lane's death after a couple days to think about it and let it  soak in all i feel is empty how uh hollow something inside me is missing the way i listen to his words  are and will be changed forever i feel his pain his suffering he was a humble man a lonely man a man  whose demons were worse than can be imagined i feel sorry for lane staley he died alone his own  personal demons killed him very slowly eating him away they killed him it took them a decade to 
[00:08:30]  finish the job a much more agonizing death than any gunshot wound may lane staley live forever through  his music his words and in our hearts that's leon yeah you always hope that something would happen  you know to get back together and uh make some more music you know that would have been cool right  because uh yeah you look at some other bands like stp were going that same route for a while  you know they were going the same route these are scots scott looked like at some at one point  everyone was going okay scott's going to be the next that's it the guy pulled it together uh i guess 
[00:09:00]  he had people in his life that are close enough to him that smacked him in the face and said hey  what are you doing you know you got a talent uh you got the the world by the balls let's go out there  and make something of it and and he did it just always seemed like lane was the kind of guy that  was not up for listening to that or maybe like i said before too didn't have the the type of people  around him that could have helped him out oh man if stp goes away yeah well no it seems two out of my 
[00:09:30]  three favorite bands of the 90s now officially gone scott seems like the kind of guy that like pulled it  together you know ben was just saying he saw him over the weekend with his kids and uh with his kid and his  wife and everything his wife's pregnant again yeah ben's uh ben pretty much ate lunch with scott  yeah pretty wild actually no he looks great it was wild seeing him he's like a real father like you  know feeding his kid and like yeah like the rock star and like he's wild watching scott wyland put  together his kids uh stroller and stuff some people just need that kick in the ass i guess from you 
[00:10:00]  know they can kind of look at themselves and look at what the reality of something is and go all right  look it was fun or miserable when it lasted or whatever as far as doing uh drugs is concerned  and then you go okay i got stuff to do now you know i can't be doing the dope and they can stop  it was uh it was actually a pretty prominent rock uh rock manager of a pretty prominent band out of  boston to try to get him tim collins try to get uh who hates anthony and i yeah i try to get them 
[00:10:30]  back on track i remember way back really never never happened aerosmith's another uh good example of a  drug drugged out band that was able to just pull it back together again they were completely on the  ring they should have been dead those guys should have been dead what happened what happened all right  let's go to the phones real fast here james what's going on man oh what's going on oh and i hey well  let me start off by thanking you guys that was the best i've heard for him all weekend i mean these  radio stations in new york suck man you guys will always have ratings for your radio station from the

[00:22:30]  men 25 plus number one men 25 to 34 number one men 25 to 44 number one we love men 25 to 49 number one  Men 25 to 54, I mean, do you want me to keep going?  It goes on and on.  How about men that are uncut?  Uncircumcised men, number one.  I'm sure we're number one.  Absolutely.  You keep going until you run out of number ones and then go, okay, that's enough.  It just goes on and on and on.  How about women?  Women.  I just have men in front of me. 
[00:23:00]  We target men.  It is huge.  The reality is the Opie and Anthony show, we target men 18 plus.  Absolutely.  I mean, capture men, not just attract, but capture.  But we love the women.  Absolutely.  There's no problem with that.  But I'm telling you.  We're not cutesy enough for the women, I guess.  Well, you've got to understand, though, with Opie and Anthony, it's in the afternoon drive on this radio station,  you guys are substantially ahead of anything else.  Substantially ahead.  Not just by like a tenth of a point here and there, but substantial. 
[00:23:30]  It's ridiculous.  It is ridiculous.  I think the men are the important ones, though,  because if your girlfriend's in your car and she doesn't like it all,  a fist in the cheekbone will change that.  Well, that's some great news, Tim.

Might as well make Philly the flagship station,  the flagship city of the O.P. and Anthony Show.  I'll come and get you now.  All right, Tim.  Thank you for the support.  We greatly appreciate it.  Well, thank you guys very much, man,  because you turned this place upside down.  I appreciate it very much.  And, Tim, thank you so much for the bottle of Dom Perignon.

[00:24:30]  We love the listeners.  Love those listeners.  Put it in the fridge, please, Mary, if you could, the bottle of Dom,  so it's nice and chilled for later in the program when we pop it.

[00:26:30]  Well, how'd you find out that we were on today?  What's that?  How'd you find out we're on today in Albany?  I listen to you every...  There's no way of telling anyone in Albany.  Yeah, I listen every day.  I listen to you guys every day.  Oh, so he can catch us.  Every single day I listen to you guys.  But I always lose you when I'm going up north, so I'm psyched now, because now I can listen  to the whole show.  Oh, I got you.  Okay.  Yeah.  Because, I mean, literally, people have to just be flipping around the dial in Albany  and just, you know, come across this new station.  Yeah, kind of fall into it.  Oh, you just wait until everybody hears about you guys, man. 
[00:27:00]  All right, cool.  You're going nuts.  All right, peace.  Good luck, guys.  Fall into your goddamn station.  What station number is it, Albany?  93.7.  The points.  What's the matter?  Hey, man.  The perch.  Hey, get the perch there, Ralphie.  Sure.  Anthony, we were in the papers like crazy.  What happened there?  At least nothing I had to worry about. 
[00:27:30]  I don't mind when we were in the New York City papers, but when there's pictures of  me on courtroom steps and allegations of group sex and whatnot, it gets me a little  nerve.  That's the first thing you want to tell Albany, that you're into group sex?  No, no, no.  It was something that was written in the paper.  Not group.  I put group at four or more participants.  Group doesn't sound as hot as menage a trois.  Yeah.  Three is threesome or menage a trois. 
[00:28:00]  But when you're talking group, that's a little sicker.  And it's got...  A whole lot.  A whole lot.  A whole lot for a topper.  Am I taking on the whole thing?  If it's four or more, there's usually some gay undertones there. 
[00:28:30]  Because there's usually another guy involved.  Well, see, my cup of tea would be more...  Oh, boy.  Go ahead.  No, no.  I would look at two girls and one guy as the only way to participate in that kind of action.  A cup of tea?  There's no...  Right.  My cup of tea, Jim Norton.  There's no other guy junk involved in there.  Two female forms.  Yeah, but we're way off on this.  That's it. 
[00:29:00]  I completely agree with you.  Of course you do.  But Norton doesn't agree with us, and a lot of our listeners don't agree with us.  We've taken phone calls from a lot of guys, and they say,  Hey, man, me and my buddy, we, you know, banged this chick and wasn't gay.  That's fine, but there is some...  I cannot be naked with my friend with another girl.  Yeah, yeah.  Ever.  It's not gay.  Oh, look who's talking.  It's not as comfortable as it would be with two girls, though.  I don't like being naked with my friend either.  It's a weird vibe, but I've done it, you know, because I'm a single girl.  And the group sex, the sound of group sex, sounds like there's just men and women, and 
[00:29:30]  the men don't care if their leg is being rubbed by a yam bag, and, you know, it's just a big  pile of humanity.  It doesn't matter if you're reaching over, and there's a hairy sack there, or, you know...  Hey, who needs that?  It all smells the same on your finger.  Jesus.  One dirty penny just like the next.  Two girls for every...  Right.  Two girls for every... 
[00:30:00]  Oh, there you go.  See, that's...  That's what answers...  That's a little more...  No, that's not what I'm into.  Oh, I said that.  That's not the beach boy.  Whoever it is.  That's Jan and Dean.  Jan and Dean.  Know your music.  Even worse.  From the ancient times.  Exactly.  Someone wanted to know, when we were playing Alice in Chains to start the show, if you were  saying, hey, I like this new band.  Who are they?  You know what?  I did like both of those songs, and I had never heard either one of them, and that's  absolutely true.  You'll be obsessing about getting the albums now?  I know.  You will.  You'll be, oh, I gotta get that. 
[00:30:30]  I'll turn you on to some good Alice in Chains stuff.  Oh, yeah.  Open-minded?  Anyway, so we answer into, like, menage et wauses.  No, no.  It was just something that was alleged in the paper.  Oh, that's what we're getting at.  Okay, yeah.  So we were in the paper like crazy over the weekend.  Rush and Malloy, they do their little gossip column, Anthony.  Oh, is that who it is?  We're starting to pop up in their column more lately.  Including a nice shot of you, I think.  I think Rush and Malloy had the paparazzi shot of you leaving the courtroom after your divorce. 
[00:31:00]  Right.  They did.  Yeah, yeah.  And they're talking about Kid Rock and Pamela Anderson.  And a little blurb here.  It says, just a few hours earlier, the freshly affianced couple had been on the Opie and Anthony show discussing how they had to squeeze in some lovemaking before the premiere.  Indeed, they arrived looking invigorated.  Yes.  Yeah, they said they had to get home for some sex, a shower, and get dressed. 
[00:31:30]  Right.  They report on that kind of stuff, huh?  And then today, Anthony.  Yeah.  In Cindy Adams' column.  Only in New York, kids.  Only in New York.  Cindy Adams.  She ain't a bad old crone at that.  She's not really giving us props, but she's talking about one of the things we did recently on our show.  Yeah.  It says, at Kathleen Turner's Newt scene during an SRO performance last week of The Graduate, a patron hollered, put your goddamn clothes on. 
[00:32:00]  I think this is what she's referring to, Anthony.  Okay.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  Get on the bed.  There you go.  I like the other version better.  The one where it's right up close.  It's the guy's mic.  That's number five even, right?  Yeah. 
[00:32:30]  You just hear those big juicy lips flapping.  The guy who still doesn't want to come forward.  He kind of came forward a little bit last week, but he's still not admitting to anything.  Well, here's a microphone that was in his shirt pocket during The Graduate.  Okay.  It's on the bed.  It's on the bed.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  This is wrong.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on.  I love that clip.  That never gets old. 
[00:33:00]  I love it.  I love it.  So it made Cindy Adams calm today.  Kathleen Turner's newt scene during an SRO performance last week at The Graduate.  A patron hollered, put your goddamn clothes on.  The house manager kicked him out.  Oot and Z.  Part of our Show Us Your Balls segment, Andy.  Yes.  And that gentleman has some set.  We're looking for other people to come forward and do some crazy things showing their ballies  for the Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, went into the theater there where The Graduate's playing when Kathleen Turner dropped her towel or robe or whatever. 
[00:33:30]  He yelled that out.  Very good.  That takes some balls.  George, what's going on?  Yeah, man.  What's up?  I'm from Philly, man.  When you guys first came on, I was so mad that they took my music off.  I understand.  Did you call us up and yell at us?  As a matter of fact, I did.  You were one of the guys that called up.  And what did we say to you when you called up and said you suck it off?  You were like, listen.  Just listen.  Give us a month and you'll change. 
[00:34:00]  We'll grow on you.  Well, guess what, man?  You guys grew on me.  Thank you, George.  We're like the invasion of the body snatchers.  You really don't want it.  You fight it tooth and nail, but eventually you have to fall asleep next to the big bean pod.  Exactly.  And you wake up wondering why you ever fought it.  I think the average listener turns us off at least ten times.  Yeah.  But something is in the back of their mind where they're like,  I gotta go see what those idiots are doing.  They gotta go back.  Oh, they're doing that.  And then they turn us off again.  Right.  But eventually you keep trying us out and something sticks. 
[00:34:30]  Exactly.  If you guys have any problems with any W, man, YF2 will be glad to have you down here  to broadcast.  George, are you a Flyers fan or a Kid Rock fan?  Unfortunately, I'm a Flyers fan right now.  They didn't look too good yet on Saturday, but hopefully they pull it together.  George, we got great ratings in Philly today.  Still number one.  In men.  Yep.  Every male demo, matter of fact.  Yes.  They've been number one for a year straight, thanks to you guys.  I got a pair of tickets to Game 5. 
[00:35:00]  Nice.  Flyer Senators.  Nice.  At the FU Center this Friday night.  You want them?  Nice.  I want them.  Hold on, George.  Nice.  Thanks, guys.  And thanks for supporting the show.  We greatly appreciate it.  Nice.  All right.  We got to go to Lisa real fast and then take a break and get into some crazy crap today.  Lisa, what's going on?  Hey.  I'm calling from D.C. and I just wanted to let you guys know that Friday night I saw my  first wow sticker here.  And I swear you, I chased this guy for five exits trying to wow him and he wouldn't let 
[00:35:30]  me over next to him.  Oh.  I was driving behind him.  I tried to get in front of him and next to him and he wouldn't let me.  There are girls that want to show you their breasts.  I don't understand.  The guy went as far as to put the sticker on the vehicle.  That's what you got to do.  You're listening to this program.  You're a lunatic if you don't put a wow somewhere on your vehicle.  Whether it's one of the station-supplied stickers that say wow on it and O and A or 
[00:36:00]  just a cardboard sign with some magic marker on there.  It doesn't even have to be magic.  It could just be a marker, Jimmy.  Regular old possibly marker.  You put that on your car somewhere in the window, whatever, and you just drive around.  And before you know it, a lovely girl like Lisa here is next to you on the highway and  she wants to show you her cans.  It makes the commute so much better.  And I got to tell you, here in New York we're starting to see a lot of wow on the highways,  man.  Everywhere I drove around on Long Island this weekend, wow stickers like crazy. 
[00:36:30]  I think more than last year.  And last year wows are starting to come back because the winter, it does, it slows down  because it gets dark by the time we're on the air.  The weather sucks.  You can't really roll your windows down and put the top down.  But now, my drive in every day, I'm seeing a lot more wows.  It's coming back.  It's the wow season.  Tis the season of boobage.  So get the wow on your cars, guys, and girls.  There's a bunch of girls out there that want to be flashed on the way home.  And so, she dropped some cars. 
[00:37:00]  And if you need a wow bumper sticker, Anthony, you can send a self-addressed stamped envelope  to us here in New York and we'll take care of you if you can't figure out how to do it  locally, okay?  Yeah.  And that address is 888 7th Avenue, New York, New York, 10106.  And if you don't have a pen, I think that address is on opieandanthony.com.  Lisa, thanks for helping us out.  Well, wow, we greatly appreciate it.  Yeah, no problem.  Tell the guys to actually slow down and don't do any of that aggressive driving BS. 
[00:37:30]  Oh, by the way, do you have a nice set?  I do.  All right.  36 double B's.  Nice.  Wow.  There's a guy that missed out.  That's right.  All right, Lisa, thank you.  All right, bye.  Jake has some advice for Albany, Anthony.  Yes, Jake.  Jake?  Hello?  Hey, Jake.  Yeah, I'm calling from Albany.  It's been 20 minutes, so I think I'm going to change the channel.  Are you using Rick's rule?  Yes.  Now we've got to play that.  Let's play that real fast for Albany.  Thank you, guys.  Do you want to explain it as we go to break, Anthony? 
[00:38:00]  There's a 20 minute rule that Rick decided to make up for the Opie and Anthony show.  Right after I said the show takes a little while to get to know some of the people involved  in the show and our brand of humor.  Ann explained the show perfectly how it's like a soap opera.  Maybe at first you're not into the characters or whatever.  Yeah.  But eventually, once again, I'll say something sticks and you get into it.  Yeah.  Fox or somebody did a huge piece on the Opie and Anthony show.  So Ann says this to the interviewer. 
[00:38:30]  It's a show you can't just tune in on day one and really get a hang of it.  It's like a soap opera.  You know, after a week, you're like, all right, I know what's going on now.  I kind of got a gist of it.  And it kind of sucks you in.  There you go.  There you go.  It's kind of a little bit about what the show's about if you're a new listener to the Opie and Anthony show.  Then I was directly contradicted in the very next scene by our own producer, Rick.  When you say Opie and Anthony show, everybody thinks sex, sex, sex. 
[00:39:00]  No.  Listen to the show.  And if you're not laughing within the first 20 minutes, then maybe you've got the wrong station.  I don't know.  Dan, I don't know.  It takes a while.  It takes 20 minutes.  Whatever.  Opie and Anthony show.  It takes 20 minutes.  Thanks for putting the pressure on us, Rick.  Thank you.  I guess everyone tuned out because we decided to go serious today to start the show.  You're waiting for a big quote.  Are you thinking about sex?  No, no, no.  No. 
[00:39:30]  No, no, no, no.  He grabbed that out of mid-air.  I know.  Because the video, too, is him looking around and going, ah, I don't know what I'm saying.  Watching that clip, we were watching it, and Opie just goes, uh-oh, he's in trouble.  Like you could see him searching.  A lot of people think, oh, and A, it's about, uh, you know, sex, sex, sex.  No.  Oh, they're still rolling on me.  Okay, I've got to come up with something.  And Opie just looked and went, oh, no, he's in trouble. 
[00:40:00]  He has no idea what he's going to say.  Oh, no, he don't have a clue about what he's going to say next.  This can only mean trouble.  Oh, well.  You're like waiting for that big statement.  If you're not laughing in the first 20 minutes, ah, maybe.  Well, why I ought to.  No, you can't say punch in the sea.  Jimmy Norton, you know the rules.  You can say clown.  Well, you can say clown.  You can say clown sea.  I heard puppies are afraid of the clowns. 
[00:40:30]  Speaking of segwaying into the news.  Eileen.  You're an awful little man.  Yeah.  Can we talk to you after break?  We've got to, like, stop for a little bit here.  Oh, sure.  Oh, Jesus, Eileen.  I see what she wants to talk about.  She wants to talk about group sex.  Hold on.  Group.  All right.  We'll talk to Eileen in D.C. next.  Okay?  20 minutes.  What else do you want to do today, Ant?  I don't know.  We've got to talk about the HBO thing that we were all watching in the office. 
[00:41:00]  HBO rules.  HBO, best channel on TV.  Yeah.  They take stuff that is just blatant pornography and present it in the way that it's an expose.  See?  They weren't showing hookers giving Hummers in cars pretty graphically.  They were doing an expose on hookers in New York.  It really annoys me.  They stole my life.  They certainly did.  Jimmy Norton's watching this, and he's been to a few prostitutes in his day. 
[00:41:30]  A lot.  And he's watching going, oh, she's good.  Oh, that guy.  You know, I'm a...  And he goes to me, he goes, I'm a good trick.  I'm sensitive.  You know, I'm slow.  I take the time.  He's like, that guy's a scumbag.  He's like, I don't care.  He's a scumbag.  I learned that the hookers have morals.  Yeah, we learned hookers have morals, and they have lines that they won't cross.  It's just bizarre to me.  Bizarre to me.  They put kind of fingers for things.  They have like a decision-making process they go through. 
[00:42:00]  In their head, they have a whole set of ridiculous rules spelt out.  They'll do A, but they won't do B.  They'll do this.  They won't do that.  How about the guy?  All right, we'll get into it.  We've got to get into it, because that guy, I know which one you're talking about.  You got that audio?  All right, we got some audio.  Oh.  But it's going to be a lot of bleeps, because there's so much cursing going on.  But we'll get into it.  I know.  She'll do the junk, but she won't lick the yam bag.  Right.  I don't understand.  I'll guarantee you.  I'll bet you there's an audio. 
[00:42:30]  All right.  We know you're an expert.  We'll talk to you about it next, Jim Norton.  It seems like every hole in my body is exploding every liquid imaginable.  OP and Anthem.  Our adult fantasy playroom is open.  This is the OP and Anthony show.  A couple phone numbers in the New York area.  877-692-1027.  Anywhere else, including Philly.  Philly.  And our brand new affiliate in Albany. 
[00:43:00]  You could use the number 866-277-4WOW.  866-277-4WOW.  We got one of the hottest chicks outside the studio.  I forgot her name.  What?  Glorianne.  Glorianne.  That's right.  Glorianne.  Oh, well, she's not outside the studio anymore.  Hey.  Remember Glorianne?  How could I forget?  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  Are your boobs even bigger now?  No, it's just my push-up bra.  Oh, she's got a push-up bra. 
[00:43:30]  You know, it's got those sensors to make them look, you know, big, bigger, bigger.  Your breast is completely coming out of the push-up bra.  Like, it's just, the push-up bra is just holding the bottom of them.  Well, during the commercial, you're trying to get my hole in one.  So, I mean, I figured, what's the difference?  Oh, foosball.  You know something?  What?  You've got a look right now with the jeans and that little frilly top thing.  Looks like a little country girl.  Well, I am a country girl.  I'm from Kansas.  Oh, Kansas.  That's right.  Yeah. 
[00:44:00]  She's from Kansas.  She's blonde and beautiful.  How tall are you, Glorianne?  5'8".  5'8".  You weigh about...  128.  128.  I was going to say something, and then I decided not to because she was speaking about  her being naked.  Right.  I am going to turn on the stinky cam for our pals listening at home.  And how big are those?  38 double D, all natural.  Yes, they are.  They're the most beautiful, all natural boobs I've ever seen.  I question that they're all natural, but she says they're all natural, Anthony. 
[00:44:30]  She says they're natural.  Right.  And the last time we had Glorianne on the show, you walked around the block topless  for us.  Yes, I did.  We did the radio right past the police officers, too.  Quick!  I'm seeing her face behind a microphone.  Move it to the side a little.  There you go.  We don't...  Yeah.  That's right.  Well, the police didn't do anything because you're allowed to walk around topless in New  York City.  Yeah, but there was even a female police officer there, so for sure I thought I'd be in trouble. 
[00:45:00]  I was like, oh no.  Well, we're...  We gotta come up with...  You got it in?  Yeah.  You got the shot?  That's it.  You can lose the top now, because now the listeners need to say...  Yeah, the listeners need to...  Oh, that was easy.  Yeah, right?  So, she's in town, Anthony.  Yeah.  She's not plugging anything.  Your flight got delayed or whatever, and you said, hey, I gotta see my pals Opie and  Anthony.  That's true.  We gotta get her to do something out there.  I know.  That's what I'm trying to think.  Will you do something for us today?  Sure. 
[00:45:30]  Look at Rick.  Yes!  As long as he comes with me.  Well, can we use your boobs for advertising or something?  Sure.  Yeah, we wanna, like, maybe send her out into Times Square.  Let me see that picture.  What the hell is that?  Hey, Rick, remember the sex basket we got?  Yeah.  Do they have anything that we can write?  Do they have any of that writing stuff?  Yeah, I think we got some stuff we can pick from.  Yeah?  Can we, like, put an advertisement on your boobs and have you walk a few blocks? 
[00:46:00]  Sure.  We can have it be a very mountainous billboard.  Yes, a boob board.  There you go.  Yeah, a boob board.  Yeah, I think we could use some advertising here in New York City.  That's what we figured.  So, maybe...  The company's not gonna put us on any billboards.  They put us on one just to impress us and kiss our asses when we were re-signing with  the company.  The company.  And you know something?  In Times Square, where the billboard was, there's so many billboards, aren't there?  Yeah.  And so many lights, and it kind of gets confusing and maybe lost in the mix.  I think our wild billboard in Times Square, you're right, got lost. 
[00:46:30]  Maybe got lost in the mix.  But how many boob boards are there down in Times Square?  I say none.  None.  None boob boards.  So, if we can, maybe on your lovely breasts, put an Opie and Anthony sign.  Sure.  Where to listen here in New York and what time.  Yeah.  Maybe make it, maybe block it off to look like one of the stickers.  I love it, Anthony.  Do we got some paint?  And I don't have lights, but I have blonde hair, which people notice. 
[00:47:00]  They certainly do.  Yeah.  I would go as far to say, people notice you walking down the street a lot.  Well, yeah, that's true.  I bet you turn a lot of heads, do you?  Well.  Jimmy Norton, what do you think?  You're a pretty gal.  Oh, hi, Jimmy.  How are you doing there?  Hey, you know, I just got two Jimmy Norton heads on her chest there.  I want to come here next time on Wednesday, because I want to participate.  I want to be one of the Whip Em Out Wednesday calls.  Did you hear we call it Whip Em Out Whenever now?  That's right.  It's Wow Whip Em Out Whenever. 
[00:47:30]  It's Wow Whenever.  You don't believe it.  Look at the back of the shirt.  See?  Not just for Wednesday.  Not just for Wednesday.  I think when I came here the last time, I didn't know that.  And I had on your t-shirt and everyone was going, oh man, I wish it was Wednesday.  I'm like, but it's Friday.  Isn't that better in New York City?  Oh, wow.  It's Whip Em Out Whenever.  It really is Whip Em Out Whenever.  As a matter of fact, you could lose the top of the internet for us.  Okay, sure.  Oh, there we go.  We have no rules.  Let's study the boobs to see how we're going to do this.  Now we can put the sign up.  Oh, so long are you eager to see? 
[00:48:00]  Oh, look.  It's just popping out, isn't it?  It's a lovable bra and it has like three things.  That bra is ridiculous, man.  It can't even hold them in.  They're so wonderful.  Wow.  Those are amazing.  Wow.  Okay.  I feel we have to applaud.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'm openly weeping right now, Anthony.  Openly weeping.  Yes.  I think we could get a nice little sign right there.  Oh, yeah.  We don't want to cover up that part, so we'll go a little above.  Right there, right where you would do the TF. 
[00:48:30]  Wait, right there?  Yeah.  I'm thinking splashed across both of them.  Grandma's delicious mystery appetizer.  You know, Anthony, we're not that important, though.  Yeah?  We're not that important to cover up the loveliness of that.  What are we going to use?  We're going to...  Yo, do we have something, Rick?  I'll do it.  Well, let's hurry up, because we've got to get her out there to advertise the show immediately.  If we don't have anything like that, perhaps we get to get a scissor and a wow sticker, 
[00:49:00]  cut the letters out strategically, and just pop them on.  Oh, yeah.  You know what you could do?  I don't like the whole sticker, though.  What about your bumper sticker?  Just cut it up, go W-O-W.  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking, but just the letters.  Yeah, I got it.  Yes, Opie, yes.  Oh, my God.  Yes.  Everyone's insane.  Those two things have to have...  They can't be covered up at all with anything.  You don't think?  No!  Look at that!  I know.  I understand.  Hey, let's face the facts.  Who cares if our names are on there?  We want to share this with our listeners out there. 
[00:49:30]  I just hope I don't get a chest cold.  Oh, ho, ho, ho!  She can make as many wacky jokes as you want.  Just do this.  Bravo.  I mean, I wouldn't even mind if she just put the wow sticker right above them  and then started walking anyway.  I don't think it would matter if she put the wow sticker at the bottom of her feet.  Nobody are going to be looking at that stupid sticker.  They're going to be looking at those wonderful things.  No, but this is to serve a purpose, Opie.  It's for advertising for us.  Why is Bob the Cop raining on our parade?  Bob the Cop, what's wrong? 
[00:50:00]  What's up, Bob?  It's against the law.  No, it isn't.  What's against the law?  She's allowed to walk around the street as long as she's not profiting or anyone benefiting from it.  I love it.  Oh, boy.  She can wear whatever she wants.  She can wear whatever she wants but you can't advertise or do what you want, guys.  I'm just trying to look out for her.  Wait, wait.  I'm talking if the most intimate of that area on the Breastises are covered. 
[00:50:30]  If that's covered, then it's fine.  That's why I was kind of thinking.  So we just have to cover up those?  Yeah.  Just dip.  Right.  Because any kind of penny...  I know nobody's looking to make money off of this but any way to promote or advertise  or for anybody to benefit off of it, with a lipstick or anything.  Well, the guys are definitely going to benefit by getting to look.  Right.  See?  But if you do have to cover them, I'd be very happy to move backwards and use my mouth. 
[00:51:00]  All right, Bob.  Yeah.  How about this?  I'm a gentleman.  How gracious of you to ask.  This beautiful woman, Gloria Ann, she walks down the street topless, probably down Broadway,  Anthony?  Right down Broadway into Times Square.  All right.  And two guys just happen to be walking, one on her right side and one on her left side,  wearing Opie and Anthony Wow t-shirts.  That would be fine.  Of course it would.  Tell me where she's going to be walking so I can check it out.  Right down Broadway, my friend.  My name's Bob. 
[00:51:30]  All right, good luck.  All right, thank you.  You got it.  We got two guys around with Wow shirts?  Yeah, let's get it.  Oh, I think we'll find them.  Let's get it done.  Loophole, Anthony.  Loophole.  Loophole.  Loophole.  We're the kings of the loophole.  Right.  Look at Earl.  Look at Earl.  Earl, the first time he's been in the studio tomorrow.  It's the first time he's come in here because you are a pisser, Earl.  This is what I was trying to tell you off the air.  Earl has not been in here.  He has made a conscious decision to dissociate himself from this show. 
[00:52:00]  Yet, when we have the lovely Glorianne in here without our tampon, Earl decides he wants  to come in.  I told Earl, you have to take the goo with the bad.  Earl, why did you have to run into the studio with Glorianne in here naked?  Earl, just please tell us what you were doing in here.  I got a call maybe ten minutes ago.  Yeah.  She asked me about a gibble.  I checked the folder.  I got the folder.  I asked Ben to take it, go outside of the studio.  Give me the thing. 
[00:52:30]  Okay.  Uh-huh.  Once I gave it back, he refused to come back outside.  How urgent is this?  Could it wait until we went into our next commercial break?  I would bet he is killing the brim.  We love you, Earl.  We love you.  Did you see that awful little wave he gave her when he came in?  That little Tommy Lee Jones?  Hello.  What do you have here?  Just waving the two middle fingers like hello on the one hand.  Hey.  Hello.  Hello.  All right. 
[00:53:00]  Well, we're going to figure it out with Glorianne, but we're on 57th and 7th.  Can you walk a few blocks on Broadway today?  Sure.  Absolutely.  Is it still raining?  We're going to have to get an umbrella for you?  I have my Tigger umbrella.  Oh.  Very nice.  Let me tell you something, man.  A TI for Tigger came out.  I was like, uh-oh.  We're going to have to dump out.  I thought you were going for the other word.  Glorianne could easily be the hottest girl that has ever appeared on our show.  And you know what?  I'm doing a movie coming up where I have to worry about getting tongued by a big Komodo dragon.  Stop.  Yeah.  What movie is that?  It's called The Curse of the Komodo Dragon. 
[00:53:30]  Let me see that.  We're shooting it in Hawaii, and we have to, like, um-  Will you be topless throughout the whole movie?  Parts of it, yeah.  Especially when I'm, like, running.  Which, see, I can do because my breasts are all natural, so we'll look good.  Are they really?  Yeah.  Is this producer's name really Hugh Janus?  I swear.  It's Hugh, H-U-G-H, and then his last name is J-A-N-U-S.  Hugh Janus.  But actually, it's like a, it's a regular movie. 
[00:54:00]  I'll be on, like, one of the TV shows.  It is.  It is.  That's classic.  Your breasts are natural and real?  Yeah.  They're perfect.  I've never seen breasts enough.  Have you ever seen boobs like that before, Jim?  No, and I'm not a breast freak either, but those are amazing.  Oh, thank you.  They really are amazing.  38 WDs, Jim.  5-8-128, you said?  28, yeah.  128.  Mm-hmm.  Vietnam, 1971.  This is the Curse of the Komodo, Opie. 
[00:54:30]  America's on the verge of losing its first war.  In the jungles of the Amazon, one young scientist has developed a new biological weapon to turn  the tide, turning small Komodo dragons into a giant, unstoppable army.  But when the control becomes impossible, there's no choice but to destroy them all.  Now, 30 years later, that same scientist returns to the Amazon, put a small crew all in and  discover that destroying the Komodos is not as easy as it seems.  If they are to survive, they must accomplish what an entire army could not.  It sounds to me like Jurassic Park with your lovely breasts. 
[00:55:00]  Exactly.  And what's the part you play?  I play a scientist.  You play a scientist.  Even better, I'm an environmental scientist.  I'm a naturalist, so I, like, go around topless, like, doing plant readings.  Do you remember any of your scientific lines in the movie?  I'm just getting the script on Thursday, reforming it in TV.  Oh, I want to hear her say some of these lines.  Well, you'll have to call the show after you've learned your lines, okay?  Okay, sure.  Rick, we learned that she can't have any writing on her body or the cops will arrest her. 
[00:55:30]  So we're going with Plan B.  Ooh, because I like being handcuffed, but I don't want her to go to jail.  Oh, so.  She's going to, Rick, she's going to walk down Broadway, topless, and we need to find  two guys with WOW t-shirts that will just kind of escort her as she goes.  This isn't you, Gloria, I'm from the movie, is it?  I don't know.  I don't even know what I'm doing here.  Oh, that's right.  That was from that Planet of the Apes porno.  Playmates of the Apes.  Playmates of the Apes.  Right. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, I just saw Darian Cage.  She's one of the stars of that last week.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, we were going to do a photo shoot together, but it didn't work out.  Wow, that would be pretty hot.  One of those pictures from movies?  You were in movies?  Oh, yeah.  And what's your website, Gloria Ann?  GloriaAnn.com.  That's W-W-W dot G-L-O-R-I-A-N-N-E dot com.  Wow.  Except it's being totally revamped, so it won't be up until next Monday again.  What I love about her, she looks so innocent.  Yes, she looks like the country girl. 
[00:56:30]  You really do.  I am the country girl.  You look like Ellie Mae.  Ellie Mae?  Ellie Mae Clampett from the Beverly Hillbillies.  She's a country girl.  We should paint her up and make her look like a cow.  Really?  Have you seen that picture on the internet?  What, of a girl that's painted like a cow?  Yeah, it's hilarious.  Really?  She turns in cowboy boots.  Yeah?  Yeah.  How old were you here?  Oh, I didn't mean to bring that.  That's when I was 13.  All right.  Let's see. 
[00:57:00]  What?  Actually, they're just model shots.  No, I started modeling when I was 13 years old.  You did, did you?  Yeah, but the funny thing, I'm the ugliest person in my family.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Everyone in my family is models.  I'm like the embarrassment of the family.  I'm serious.  Yeah, sure.  Like Marilyn was at the Munsters house.  Oh, we're a little shamed in Marilyn with those looks of hers.  No, really.  I think that's why people always think I'm so nice because, like, growing up I had to rely 
[00:57:30]  on my personality because I was...  Get out of here.  Just stop it.  There's no way you had to rely on my personality.  Everyone in my family has been professional models.  I'm like the least successful model in my family.  When you say professional models, like stuff we've seen?  Yeah.  Like, my grandmother was a model.  My aunt was a model.  Hubba Hubba.  What did your grandmother have?  23 Skidoo.  Oh, my grandma was in a lot of the movies in Hollywood as, like, one of the dancers.  And, yeah, she was gorgeous.  Yeah.  She was still winning, like...  The old Follies. 
[00:58:00]  The old Follies.  Well, she wasn't one of the Follies girls, but...  Ziegfeld.  Was she in Vaudeville?  Sure, sure, sure, sure.  I remember seeing her grandmother in Vaudeville.  How do you know?  That's what...  My grandmother looked a lot like Lana Turner, except she was 5'10", so she was taller.  Yeah?  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we've got to get her out on the street, man, to advertise for the show.  Yeah, please.  That'd be great.  It's boob advertising on the Opie and Anthony show today.  A boob board.  So we've got two volunteers that have WOW shirts that could escort her down Broadway? 
[00:58:30]  Mm-hmm.  We'll figure it out.  Anyone?  All right.  Gloria Ann in studio, you'll take a little walk so we can do a little radio.  Yeah.  And then you come back and hang some more, right?  Okay, sure.  So Gloria Ann will be walking down Broadway completely topless, Anthony.  Yes.  All she's wearing is those jeans, right?  Uh-huh.  You've got your boots on.  Yeah.  And she's got a little umbrella, and we'll get two guys to escort her down the street.  Steve from foundrymusic.com will definitely shoot some video.  And Anthony, you've got a free shot at the stinky cam.  Oh, oh, oh. 
[00:59:00]  Because there's a guy in D.C. going, dude, keep her on the stinky cam for ten more minutes.  I'm ten minutes from home.  Okay.  Um, we've got to fix some of the lighting.  Rick, get that light right off of it, because it's causing a glare.  Yeah, let's get a perfect shot of Gloria Ann.  It's causing a glare.  For the stinky cam before we head out onto the streets.  All right.  We're going to start at 56 in Broadway, by the way.  There you go.  Just, that is probably a very good shot.  Well, her hair is stuck in the headphones, Anthony.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:59:30]  Get all sexy there, Gloria.  Get all sexied up.  Here we go.  We're taking a shot for the stinky cam.  And...  Oh, yeah.  She's doing the finger pose, Anthony.  Let me see how that works.  My favorite pose from Gloria Ann.  Yeah.  Gloriaann.com.  I think the...  That's Gloria with an I.  I think the stinky cam exploded.  Oh, boy.  No, that ain't it.  Hold on, hold on.  Oh, boy.  Let's get another.  Yeah, do that.  Yeah, just stay just like that.  You bastards.  Yeah, like I could tell the listeners. 
[01:00:00]  Could you not check out the picture for a second?  Let me try again.  All right.  We're trying.  Just hold that pose, because I think that one might have taken.  Hold that pose.  Even that one's a good one, if it didn't.  But there you go.  And stop.  All right.  Go to the stinky cam to see Gloria Ann topless.  Wow.  Bruh.  Look at that.  Beautiful.  Oh, my God.  She just ripped the shirt off, and now she is completely topless.  And she is ready to take her walk down Broadway to advertise for the show.  Look at Pete Johnson, everyone. 
[01:00:30]  Hi, yay.  I remember her grandmother in Mauderville.  Hey, Pete.  Get in here.  Pete.  Pete.  Look at Pete.  Get out of here.  He's a great engineer.  He runs this ship.  He ran.  Oh, man.  I had to run.  I don't want to get goo on the microphones.  All right, Ann.  So, 56 on Broadway.  She'll start her walk as she advertises for the Opie and Anthony show today.  All right.  All right.  Quick break, and we'll come back.  We'll talk about the HBO special.  Yeah.  Got to talk about Robert Blake. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, what a dick.  Yeah, he was supposed to be at the chiller convention, but obviously he was not available.  Oh, he was?  Signing autographs?  Yeah, and a girlfriend of mine, Amber Newman, had just been filming a movie like right down  the block from there.  Really?  Yeah.  Look how she poses when she just stands.  Yeah.  Perfect poses.  Yeah.  Okay.  All right.  I'll see you guys.  All right.  Jesus, you're so hot, man.  You're ridiculously hot.  And she knows it.  All right. 
[01:01:30]  We'll take a break.  You're not going to be too chilly out there, are you?  Oh.  That's right.  Right.  People are just going to literally crap themselves.  Yes.  As they walk down the sidewalk, you're going to have to, you're going to literally see  people crapping themselves.  You tell me this isn't one of the hottest blondes you've ever seen in your life.  We share with our listeners.  She'll be at 56 in Broadway, and she's going to walk down Broadway for a few blocks.  We want to try to get her all the way to Times Square.  I don't know if it's going to happen, Anthony.  Let's see. 
[01:02:00]  We'll see.  All right.  All right.  Stay there.  We'll continue.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Without a thing with the .  No one else can get away with the .  Nobody in the world can get away with the .  Wait a minute.  Now you're going to bleep me.  You ill-mannered sack of crap.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Whoop.  Whoa.  Hey.  Look at that, Anthony.  Whoa.  Hey. 
[01:02:30]  The show has come to a complete stop.  We're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's going to kill us, but we're going to kick Gloria out of the studio, Anthony.  Yeah.  She's heading down to the streets of New York.  Every time she visits our radio show, we have her take a little walk around the streets  so we can share with our listeners, right?  Yes.  This time we're being a little selfish.  We're going to have a couple of guys with the Opie and Anthony Wow t-shirts on.  Blanking her. 
[01:03:00]  Blanking the living crap out of her.  Her and her 38 double D.  Tommy on instant feedback says, that chick is re-goddamn-diculously hot.  Yeah, we got a picture up on the stinky cam.  We froze one of the pictures.  Yeah.  We can't get instant feedback.  We can't do anything for this show because you guys just crashed our internet system,  but that's okay.  Completely.  As long as you're enjoying the photo that's up there.  Yeah.  I suggest you go out like that so you don't catch a cold.  Yeah. 
[01:03:30]  Okay.  No, I like the whole top, dude.  It's completely topless?  Come on.  What, are you insane?  Well, I mean the boobs are completely, you know.  Nah.  The naked, no, no.  The naked is naked.  All right.  The shoulders, the hair coming down, the whole midriff part completely bare.  There.  Deal.  You insane.  Well, we're going to check in with Rick and Steve from foundrymusic.com.  Gloria Ann, we got to say goodbye to you.  Yeah.  I will see you guys.  But you'll come back after your walk and we'll talk to you some more.  I know.  But we got to do like radio and stuff now.  Okay.  Playtime is over for us.  We just sacrificed bad radio. 
[01:04:00]  No, I just didn't play.  So we can take a look at you naked.  Yeah.  But she's going to be at 56 and Broadway starting her walk downtown toward Times Square.  We'll see how far she gets.  All right.  Where do I go?  All right.  There she goes.  All lovely and stuff from Kansas.  There she goes.  Look at her walking out the door.  And she comes back.  Norton's gotten her four times I think so far.  Four times.  All right.  Well, I can't even look at her.  She's too hot.  It's impressive. 
[01:04:30]  She's ridiculously hot.  They're so heavy and perfect that you know she's from the Midwest.  38 double D's.  Perfect.  Perfect natural boobs.  So slim.  I mean, you know, usually 38 D's are attached to a monster.  We just keep talking about the boobs, but I mean the whole package.  The hair.  The kind of waist.  Yeah, she's got a thin waist.  Gorgeous butt.  She's the type of girl you'll look at on the internet and just bite your arm because  you can't get her because you're such a loser.  She looks like the kind of girl that could be on the hay bales in the barn with the little  hay seed stem coming out of her mouth. 
[01:05:00]  There's something that resembles that going into it.  It's just laying there.  And she pours the big, what are they called, the milk jug?  Yeah, those big milk things.  No, no.  I mean, you milk the cows into a what, Anthony?  Into a what?  A pail.  A pail?  Okay.  A bucket.  Sure.  So then you got the cow milk and she's just dumping it all over her body.  Yeah.  And a nice mucus and cow pus all over it.  That kills the fantasy.  And you grab an axe from the wall and just hack her up.  I was in Pax across the street buying my lunch. 
[01:05:30]  Yeah.  And it was a really old lady, she was probably 80, asking how much the coffee was.  How much is the coffee?  Exactly.  The little walker with those awful white flesh colored stockings that are all crumpled.  She'd bring out the little change purse to pay for it with the little clip thing on top.  Open it up.  Jingle, jingle.  I didn't look that close because the smell of tinkle.  Oh.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Awful.  And normally that would make me want to ask for a phone number. 
[01:06:00]  Yeah.  But on her it was an atrocious odor.  Poor old people, man.  Poor old people.  Get out there and shower before you walk into an eatery, you old bag.  I don't know what it is because I was in the movies a while back and I'm walking out the aisle.  And you know me.  I like being left alone.  I don't want to know from nothing.  If I go to the movies, I want to walk in.  I want to sit down and watch a movie.  I want to walk out.  That's it.  This old woman's like clogging up the aisle.  She's in a wheelchair.  She's clogging up the whole aisle.  I'm standing there waiting to get out. 
[01:06:30]  So I'm just like, oh, I'm trying to figure out how to get around.  She goes, excuse me, sir, could you push me out of the theater, please?  Ugh.  Now what am I going to do, right?  I'm going to F off and say no.  Have some chutzpahs.  I know.  You know, I can't be a scumbag all the time.  You know where your face is positioned as you push a wheelchair?  No.  In a vertical line with her butt and her back. 
[01:07:00]  I'm hovering above her shoulders, you know, as you push a wheelchair.  And the aromas, the gentle wafting fragrances are coming up from the back of the chair.  It was like it was crap.  And it was the other stuff.  Number one and number two, let's say.  Number one and number two, parfait.  So there you are with a nice fat rod.  Hey, I can push the chair without my hands after that one. 
[01:07:30]  You know what was great, though, is the old lady was standing there stinking  and this young, hot girl noticed that the old lady's shoes were untied.  I said, I just noticed that your shoe's untied.  Would you mind if I tied it?  Oh, no, so she had to get right down there.  She got right down there and tied her shoe.  The heavy aromas just sinking down a shoe level.  And she has to.  It would have been really nice if the young girl had noticed on me that my mule was small  and off of the drain.  Jesus.  They get there.  They get what happens is their their adult diaper gets all wet. 
[01:08:00]  And that's what it is.  There's no one like a baby.  If a baby gets wet, mommy or daddy's there to throw them on the changing table and change.  Would that be a pisser?  If you walk into a men's room, you see grandpa up on the table getting his ditey changed.  There was a big difference, though, because when you're a baby, someone will change you  and put a little powder on your bum.  Right.  Yeah, kind of freshen it up.  When you're that age, you just got to sit in it until two young Spanish guys punch you 
[01:08:30]  in the face and take your purse.  You're insane.  Billy, what's going on?  Hey, Billy, hold on one second.  We'll go to Billy.  He wants to talk about the HBO special.  You got to go all the way down here?  Yeah.  Hello?  Hey, Rick, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  We already have a caravan of about 50 guys following us.  Oh, really?  They enjoy the view.  This has just got bad vibes and bad, bad things over.  Shut up and get walking.  We're walking. 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, she's got to advertise the O.P. and Anthony show.  We need some advertising in New York here.  Who's flanking the lovely girl?  Uh, Steve and I.  Steve and I.  Steve and you, and you're wearing your WOW shirts.  We've got our pouch on, and we've got Gloria Ann, and we've got about 50 deviants following  us down the street.  Well, what kind of reaction are you getting from the people that are just kind of glancing  over?  People are just like these two guys in a van over here, just pulling over.  We've got cars pulled over all over the place.  People just standing out there watching. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, no.  This is deja vu.  They love boobage.  This is deja vu.  Who doesn't love it?  And you know something?  This ain't no slob boobs we're giving you here today.  Yeah, we're giving you the best.  These are prime grade A cans.  That's right.  She's not doing anything lewd, right?  Not yet.  No, no, I don't have her do anything lewd.  No, I mean not at all.  She's never going to do anything lewd.  She's just going for a little walk on a Monday afternoon in New York City.  Nate from Cleveland must have seen her picture because he writes she is the single most effable 
[01:10:00]  effing chick I've ever seen.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll check back in a few minutes, guys.  All right.  You're on Broadway right now?  Yeah, we're just coming up to 53rd Street.  53rd and Broadway.  Oh, look at that.  Making their way down the Great White Way.  Hey, Rick.  Are you going to try to make it to Times Square?  We're going to go to Times Square.  That's the goal.  All right, cool.  A lot of tourists in Times Square.  Thanks, Rick.  Thanks, Rick.  We'll check back in a bit.  Bye.  All right.  All right.  Let's take bets. 
[01:10:30]  I say he gets arrested on 45th and Broadway.  You're saying 45th and Broadway?  I'm saying they've got to kind of get down into Times Square.  When they first start hitting the cops that are just stationed there that walk the beats  in Times Square.  And where does that start?  Around 40?  Is it 50?  No, I think it's around 45th.  That's why I said 45th.  I'm thinking of the outskirts.  Ben says 46th.  Opie, I'm going with you.  I like 45th.  Although, you know what?  I'm going to do the Price is Right screw move on you.  All right. 
[01:11:00]  And go 46th.  Well, that's what Ben's got.  I'm going one more up.  Okay, then I'll go the screw move down.  44th?  44th.  I said 43rd.  What?  You bastard!  Yeah, I'm going to undercut you.  43rd?  Are we going with closest?  I go 43rd.  I'm going with Battery Park.  Screw you all.  40th.  40th.  40th.  40th.  40th.  I'm going Statue of Liberty.  I'm going Brooklyn.  I'm going Jersey City.  I'm going Hoboken.  Let's get crazy.  The South Pole!  Oh, I was going to go to Maryland, but you got me beef. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, my.  Pat, what's going on?  Uh-oh.  Hey, guys.  Hey, Pat.  Listen, she came out on Broadway.  Yeah.  There was a cop station on the corner of Broadway.  There's another cop station on the corner of 55th.  They're trailing behind her a half a block in the patrol cars.  All right.  So we got three cars already following Gloriana.  She takes her lovely walk down Broadway today.  Yep.  Yes.  All right.  Thank you, Pat.  Later, guys.  Bye.  All right. 
[01:12:00]  What do you think, you really think they're going to get in trouble?  I don't know if they're going to arrest you because she's not doing anything rude.  Right.  That's what I'm saying.  They might say, look, put the...  There's a difference with the voyeur bus.  It was a bus.  It was a traffic thing.  It was...  The president was in town.  With this, it might just be, look, put your shirt on and we're going to arrest you.  Yeah.  Let's put the shirt on.  They might think it's a terrorist attack or something.  Oh, really?  They are wonderful to look at.  What's the problem with people?  Imagine the weight of those.  Like, ooh, those are heavy and lovely. 
[01:12:30]  Yeah, yeah, right?  You just get a little buoyancy check on them.  You're rolling around the bar naked, those jeans.  All right.  Rick is checking back in.  Let's see what's going on.  All right.  Let's speak with Rick.  All right.  Rick?  Yo.  What's going on, Rick?  We're coming up to 50th Street.  50th and Broadway?  And people are pulling their trucks over, waving the stickers.  We're getting a good response, I think.  Of course.  A lot of people are being turned on to the Opie and Anthony show.  That's right.  We need to advertise again. 
[01:13:00]  That's what it's all about.  For this radio show.  We're coming to a group of guys right here.  Yep.  Hello.  Gloria.  Help.  Uh-oh.  Gloria Ann.  They're liking Gloria Ann, Rick?  Yes, they do.  And we are...  Steve is filming for the website.  Yes.  Hey.  You can hear the traffic is following us.  Hey, Rick.  Yeah.  For old times' sake, could you just repeat after me?  Yeah.  This is legal, isn't it?  Oh, it's better freaking be.  Just in case, Rick. 
[01:13:30]  Do it again, Rick.  This is legal, isn't it?  We got a lot of cameras.  Oh, sir, how are you?  We haven't seen boobs like that in 50 years.  Our Garrett's an awesome Garrett.  Our Garrett's an awesome Garrett, he says.  Very good.  All right.  We don't have to turn that guy on to the show.  He already knows it.  Hey, Rick.  We got...  You wouldn't believe all the people just pulling their cars over and running through traffic.  Ah.  And, uh...  Which is safe.  Oh, good.  Now, how many people are following you at this point?  Um... 
[01:14:00]  At least about 75 to 80 at this point.  And Rick's like the Pied Piper.  Right.  The Pied Piper of boobdom.  Are you and Gloria Ann?  Are you a child, isn't it?  Um...  No.  It's not that good.  All right.  So, so far, so good, right?  So far, so good.  We're just crossing in front of Caroline's Comedy Club on the 50th.  50th and Broadway.  50th and Broadway.  Okay.  And we're coming out to Times Square.  Times Square.  Here we go.  Okay.  And, uh, are you getting a lot of looks?  Uh, we're getting a lot of leering. 
[01:14:30]  It's not looking.  It's called leering.  Yes.  Has anybody, especially like old nasty women, given a very nasty look like they're pissed  about it?  No.  So far, the only person over 50 that we've seen have been men and they've just been in  awe of the size of the cans that are walking past them.  Yeah.  Do you see any cops about a block behind you?  Um, do I?  Yeah.  Um...  Well, there was some earlier.  Yeah, why?  Yeah, why?  I'm just asking.  I'm making sure everything's okay. 
[01:15:00]  Everything is cool.  Opie, is this part of the art you spoke so eloquently about on the Bill O'Reilly show  on Fox?  Well, an artist wants his work out there.  His work to be out there.  An artist needs the public to see his work.  Yes.  This is no different than if you had a Picasso in your hands.  That's right.  Walked down Times Square.  Perhaps a sculpture.  That's right.  Or something.  Right.  I understand.  Oops.  Rick, where are you now?  Uh, let's see.  We're coming up to 48th Street.  We're still about a good four blocks from Times Square, the main area. 
[01:15:30]  You think you're going to make it to 45th?  Oh, oh.  What was that sound I heard?  Huh?  Oh, nothing.  Okay.  I heard car horns beeping.  Yeah, car horns are beeping.  One guy wants to just shake her hand.  All right.  Don't let the disgusting people touch her.  All right.  Um, we might have some...  What is that?  What street are you at?  We are at 48th.  Wait, what did you just say?  You might have what?  Some activity.  What do you mean by that?  You know.  What? 
[01:16:00]  The bus.  Damn it.  You've got to go a few more streets.  We're trying.  We're stuck in the right, though.  Get to 45.  44.  44.  44.  45.  44 is the goal.  No, 45.  44.  I'll give you half, Rick.  45.  44.  We can do 44.  Get to 45 at least.  Go as low as you can.  All right.  Stop at 45th and just kind of hang out.  All right.  You got it.  All right.  Well, check in a little bit.  You got it.  Stop at 44th and break out the dildo. 
[01:16:30]  No.  I have to change to 47th, by the way.  Oh, screw you.  You can change.  No.  Because now it's in game.  Of course you could change earlier.  No, no.  You can't change.  We are not accepting your change.  He's not walking to 45th.  No one told me that.  We are.  We are.  No, he's going as far as he can.  He's going to try to go all the way to 47th.  We are not accepting your change.  Because you said he's only trying to go to 45th.  Charlie Changer over here, Opie.  He wants to change.  Let's, uh...  Sure, wait until the horses bust out of the gate and go to the window and go, 
[01:17:00]  Oh, the race ain't over.  I want to change my back in the back stretch.  You're right.  I stick.  Let's go to Pat.  Hey, guys.  Listen, I just pulled in 48th Street.  The cops are circling the block around her at this point.  Oh, I don't think so.  They are, yeah.  Just like sharks.  Enjoying the scene.  That's right.  And she's just taking a nice little walk.  Beautiful.  Beautiful girl in Times Square.  That's all Steve is...  That's all it's all about.  Steve is checking out the scanner.  Steve.  Okay, yeah.  No, no.  Okay, listen.  They didn't want to add to the nuisance. 
[01:17:30]  Okay?  All right.  But they're looking.  They're waiting for it.  They don't want to cause it a nuisance.  More cars like that honking?  Yeah.  That's what they're going to try and get you at.  So you can cover it up or something.  But they're looking for a nuisance.  Oh, there's no nuisance.  You're a nuisance, Steve.  That's right, Steve.  You fuddy-duddy.  You.  You.  No fuddy-duddy.  You're a party pooper.  Don't be such a stick in the mud.  Why?  It puts on a lotion board.  All right.  That guy.  Thank you, Steve.  Thank you, Steve.  Well, I don't see Rick on the line, so I guess everything's fine. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah.  Rick would have called, right?  Although, his last transmission was something like, I think they're in trouble.  I think they're in trouble.  I think they're in trouble.  They're in trouble.  They're in trouble.  Then he used the 70s term, the fuzz.  The fuzz.  Who called?  Yo, honky.  I think the fuzz am coming.  Hey, Rick's checking back in.  Rick, what's up?  Hey, Rick.  Hello, fellas.  How are you?  Good.  What's going on? 
[01:18:30]  We're doing well.  We're going to 46th Street.  Yeah.  And?  It's amazing the cooperation that we have received to this point.  All right.  46th and Broadway.  Yeah.  46th and Broadway.  There seems to be a lot of traffic around here for some reason.  Well, it's Times Square.  It's the crossroads of the world, they call it.  Yeah.  I can't figure it out, but.  It's Times Square.  It's 5 o'clock.  Of course there's going to be cars out there.  And you know what?  I forgot.  There's a lot of tourists in this area.  Right.  Right.  Taking.  That's right.  Are they snapping a lot of pictures?  Oh.  Cameras are going off like crazy.  I guess because of all these billboards, all the brand new billboards they have here 
[01:19:00]  in Times Square.  Yes.  Yes.  It's pretty amazing.  Isn't that great?  All right.  Rick, Tom is saying that the president is in town today.  And Tom is full of S.  All right.  Are you past 46th Street?  I'm trying.  I can't.  I don't see a street sign, but I think we're at like 46 right now.  Oh, boy.  Keep going.  Keep going.  We're right in front of the barcode.  All right.  Keep going.  Ben's out.  Ben's out.  We're just walking.  Have a leisurely stroll.  It kind of warmed up today, which is nice.  Right.  Especially for Gloria Ann. 
[01:19:30]  You have to turn around and make it back to 56th and Broadway.  I think we're going to go down to like 40, 44.  No, I see.  You got to go lower.  42nd.  Go to 42nd.  Yeah.  40 seconds.  42nd is the famous street.  Famous street in Times Square.  That we all know and love from the old days before they cleaned it up.  Yeah, exactly.  There's a tremendous amount of ladies who seem to be taken by Gloria Ann's gifts.  Yeah.  All right.  Rick, how is she?  Is she completely topless?  She is, yes.  Completely topless. 
[01:20:00]  And she has her umbrella?  I have her umbrella because it's not raining.  Oh, I thought maybe she was holding it like a little parasol.  Oh, did you want her to hold the umbrella?  That's a great idea.  That could be hot.  That could be hot.  Yeah.  All right.  Here.  She has her little trigger umbrella.  She's a very big fan of Disney.  And Steve is filming this for foundrymusic.com, Andrew.  Right.  Yes, he is.  All right.  Look at all the people.  You know, Times Square gets busy.  Yeah.  Well, it's that time of the day.  Of course it does.  Of course it does.  And I think there's a few listeners here, too. 
[01:20:30]  What time does TRL start?  It's over, right?  It just finished.  Oh, damn it.  Unfortunately.  Well, that would have been a little bit of fun for MTV.  Yeah.  We're coming up to 45 right now.  Ooh.  45.  All right, Ben, you're out.  Ben's out.  All right.  Why don't you hang out on 45th for a while?  No, no, no.  Keep walking, Rick.  We must keep walking.  We're going to keep walking.  There must be something to check out on 45th.  No?  Nothing.  Nothing like that.  44th is where all the action is.  What do you see around 45th Street there, Rick? 
[01:21:00]  Well, what I see coming up on 45th is nothing compared to what I see on 44th, which is the  big ABC Studios.  Ah!  ABC Studios.  I believe their 5 o'clock newscast?  Yes.  It's coming up very soon.  But I don't think they do anything from that.  They don't?  Do they?  I don't know.  I don't think so.  And you know what else is on 43rd?  What?  Town Hall.  Jim, you already did that show, you tool.  That's right, Jim.  Are you plugging for next year?  All right, Rick.  Hmm.  All right.  Well, we're going to keep walking. 
[01:21:30]  The cameras are quite, you know, you would think there's a rock star or something around  here with all the way the cameras are going on.  I bet.  And our WOW shirts are close to Gloria Ann, so they can't help but get a shot of our T-shirts,  right?  Right.  This is perfect advertising for the O.P. and Anthony Show, Anthony.  I am looking at one of the live cams that are all over Times Square on the web.  Yeah?  I cannot quite tell which intersection this is.  Well, you tell me what intersection you want me to go to where there's a live cam, and 
[01:22:00]  we'll find it.  There's a...  Oh, man.  That does look like 7th.  Yes, yes.  Someone will help us out with the live cams, Rick.  Oh, look at there.  There's a police car.  There's a few police cars in the area.  All right.  Let's move this way.  We're crossing the street.  We're closing in on the goal of 44th, so we're going to bypass that pretty quick.  All right.  Again, ABC Studios.  Wow.  It should be great.  Yeah.  Why don't you guys stroll in today?  Hey.  Hey, there's a homeless guy.  Tell me off for a dollar.  Would you like a homeless, uh, a topless woman to tell you off, sir? 
[01:22:30]  Come here, Gloria.  Yeah, this is the guy that you can pay him a dollar in Times Square and tell him off.  What's your name?  Yeah.  Miller?  Billy.  Billy has a sign that says, tell me off for one dollar.  Uh-huh.  Would you mind if she did it free, but topless?  Yeah.  That's cool?  Free?  Give the goddamn guy a dollar.  I'm a dolly, you cheapskate.  What can you say?  I'm from Kansas.  She has nothing mean to say she's from Kansas.  All right.  Well, give them a compliment.  Well, at least compliment them.  Yeah, give the guy something. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, Rick, someone is suggesting that you stroll into the Virgin Megastore.  Excuse me?  Someone is suggesting you stroll into the Virgin Megastore.  Lord, that's a good idea.  All right.  Thanks so much.  She can't think of anything mean to say, but check out those cans.  All right.  Give us the occasion.  All right.  Put the occasion here.  What is it?  We're just celebrating booze.  Lord, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  Lord, have mercy.  That's from Billy.  Lord, have mercy.  Rick, where are you right now?  Are you anywhere near the NASDAQ building? 
[01:23:30]  Let's see.  We've got live cameras in front of ABC.  We're walking right now.  Oh, live cameras?  What?  Yes, yes.  It's ABC.  Do it.  Do it.  We're getting info from other sources telling us to run over.  Oh, my God.  Is it on?  Yeah, we got ABC on.  Where is that?  Where's that shot?  I don't think they do their news from that studio, though, man.  No?  No.  Unless maybe they're right in Times Square or something.  Ah, they're going to a Fatal Fire story.  Damn it.  Damn. 
[01:24:00]  All right, Rick.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Someone wants to say something to us here.  Let's go to John.  Hey, John, what's up, bro?  Hey, I saw the naked chick and, you know, I didn't see NEO.  I didn't see NEO and any stuff, but I knew you guys were responsible.  Oh, cool.  You're making the pedestrians of Midtown very effing happy right now.  Of course.  Who doesn't want to see this?  Old ladies are smiling.  Well, this is our boob board.  We're trying to advertise our stupid radio show.  Thank you, thank you.  I'll talk to you later.  We're starting to realize that we need a little help in New York.  A little help. 
[01:24:30]  Here's our first effort at getting the word of the show out there.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're on OP and Anthony.  What's up?  Chris?  Hey.  Hey, brother, man.  I've seen them on Earth Cam, man.  They were on there.  45th and Broadway.  Two minutes ago.  I've seen Rick standing there talking to you guys.  And I've seen Gloria Ann.  Oh, so he made Earth Cam?  Yeah.  They were on there.  Nice.  I was on Earth Cam and I saw a shot where everyone was looking in one direction with smiles  with smiles on their faces.  All right.  Cool.  So you can tell what they're looking at. 
[01:25:00]  All right, Chris.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take care.  Let's go back to Rick.  Rick.  Rick, Rick.  Guys.  Where are you?  We are in front of ABC Studios.  There's a camera guy out here.  I don't know if he's for ABC, but it's a real camera and he loves the footage he's getting.  I bet he does.  Did you inform him where the girl is from?  He hasn't bothered to ask.  He's just looking.  They're very close to Gloria Ann.  Believe me.  I've got mine predominantly displayed right next to her for Wright Hoover. 
[01:25:30]  Very nice.  Rick, hold on a second.  We've got a guy that works for Earth Cam.  It's Phil.  Phil, what's up?  Hi.  Hey.  Yeah, with Earth Cam, we were following you with the camera for a little while.  Oh, you were?  Street level cameras are on 45th at Broadway by Lindy's.  See?  45th is perfect, Anthony.  Yeah.  Perfect place to be.  I told you.  All right.  Thank you, Phil.  It's back and forth.  Yeah.  We'll try to go back to 45th and Broadway.  All right.  Great.  Thank you.  Thanks. 
[01:26:00]  All right.  Hey, Rick.  Should we go back to 45th and Broadway?  No, no, no, no, no.  On your way back, because you've got to make it down to 42nd, and then on the return trip,  make sure you go to 45th and Broadway.  A lot of people are checking out the Earth Cam.  You got it.  All right.  All right.  We'll call you back in 42nd.  All right.  Cool.  Are you going into the Virgin Megastore?  I think we already passed that, but we'll stop at ESPN zone.  All right.  Cool.  Well, call's back.  All right.  All right.  Bye.  Beautiful.  I've seen some of Glorianne's videos. 
[01:26:30]  John thinks she's hot.  Yeah, she's beyond hot.  People just, yeah.  Let's go to Paul.  What's up, Paul?  Hey, I learned that you spelled Kansas.  C-A-N-S-A-S.  Yes, you do.  Kansas.  Very good.  Kansas.  Okay, boys.  All right, bye.  All right.  But you know what?  We're going to...  What if we...  All right, we're going to break...  If we have to, we'll cut into the commercials to get back to Rick, okay?  All right.  I'm sure the rest of the country is going to love that.  And Robert Blake, we'll talk about that.  We'll talk about the hooker special at HBO. 
[01:27:00]  Yeah.  And we'll talk about this fraud that is talking to dead people.  Oh, yeah, another guy that thinks he's John Edward.  Well, John Edward's a fraud, too.  Hey, stop it.  I see it all the time.  He talks to dead people.  We proved it the other day that he's a fraud.  Validate your relationships.  Shut up.  Bonnie Lee Bakley, this guy talked to.  I guess the show's on Tonight at 10 on ABC.  We got to get audio of this because he talks to a bunch of kind of like, I don't know,  C-list celebrities. 
[01:27:30]  And the guy talked to Bonnie Lee Bakley and I guess didn't ask her, you know, who killed him.  Who killed you?  Or if he did, she didn't know.  How about that?  So, we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show.  Stay there.  Are you ready?  Opie and Anthony are going to touch your word dirty.  Take it like a scam, okay?  The Opie and Anthony show.  Here, checking out the Opie and Anthony show.  I want to thank Philly once again. 
[01:28:00]  We got huge ratings in Philly today.  Ridiculously huge.  Yeah.  We've been broadcasting to Philly for almost a year now, Anthony.  Yeah.  Ten months.  And the ratings came out today and we went, I mean literally, through the roof.  Yes.  Ridiculously huge.  So, we want to thank you guys for supporting the show in Philly.  We greatly appreciate that.  Uh-huh.  Today in New York City, we got Rick.  Because quite frankly, the Opie and Anthony show, we need a little help in New York. 
[01:28:30]  Just a little.  Yeah.  I don't get it.  But what the hell, you know?  Maybe we got to push a little harder.  You know?  Maybe we got to get out there a little bit.  So, what are people like?  Boobs.  Boobs.  So, we're doing the boob board today.  Boob board.  Kind of like a billboard, but it's a boob board.  Right.  We have Glorianne.  This girl is ridiculously hot.  We got a picture of her on the Stinky Cam, still frozen when she was in the studio.  She went out on the streets with a couple guys.  They got the WOW shirts on that have our names and the show and the station here in New York. 
[01:29:00]  Yeah.  And in the middle is Glorianne, completely topless, just taking a stroll all the way down to Times Square  and back with her.  Yeah.  He's 5'8", 128 pounds.  Blonde.  Absolutely gorgeous.  Tiny little waist.  Perfect butt.  People seem to be enjoying this.  Gorgeous, gorgeous boobs.  The hottest boobs I've ever seen, matter of fact.  Especially natural.  Wow.  And Rick is back on the line.  Rick.  Yo.  What's going on?  How's it going, Rick?  Guys, as you said, we're out.  We're meeting with people.  We're pressing the flesh.  That's what you got to do. 
[01:29:30]  Press that flesh.  And it's amazing just how, you know, you talk about the troubling times in this country,  all the racism.  Those barriers have been knocked down by Glorianne and her luscious hands.  Luscious, luscious breasts.  Luscious.  Yes.  Everyone coming together, right?  One guy, one old gentleman with a cane nearly had a seizure and fell in the same shot  when he saw these things.  Great.  Right.  We hit him.  It was great.  Now, are people following you, Rick?  Oh, of course.  We haven't had some teen girls run over and get a picture with her. 
[01:30:00]  Hey, how about that?  It's like a celebrity.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And the guys with the WOW shirts are right next to her, right?  Yeah, we're right here with our WOW shirts.  Where about are you?  We are now making our way back.  We're just getting up to 47th.  We did make it to 42nd during spots.  Okay.  Well, we didn't want to hang there too long because of the crowd and the certain presence  of the police that were making their way over to disperse the crowd.  The fuzz?  Rick, the fuzz?  Yeah, the fuzz. 
[01:30:30]  Like I said before.  Yeah, I think it's very smart to just keep moving.  Yeah.  We're going to keep moving and we're going to make our way back to the station.  But we're going to go up 7th instead of Broadway this time to give other people who  haven't had a chance to see.  Rick, you're effing it up because people are calling like crazy going, I can't wait to see  Rick as he makes the return trip up Broadway.  Right.  Well, then we're going to cross right now and go back to Broadway then.  Yeah, now on Broadway.  Yeah, because a lot of people are already just waiting for you.  You're going to walk up Broadway from 47th all the way to 56th, right? 
[01:31:00]  That is correct.  Alright, cool.  So Rick is making his way back to the station on Broadway with topless Gloria Ann.  We're picking it up back on Broadway and it's just incredible the love and support  that is coming out for WOW.  Of course, people love it.  Very nice.  Loving the program.  Yes.  Someone is calling going, I'm outside ESPN.  Where are they?  Oh, we just walked past ESPN.  Yeah, they're a little further uptown now than there.  Alright, Rick, we'll check in in a little bit.  You got it, guys. 
[01:31:30]  Are you stopping in the Virgin Megastore?  We tried to, but there were some people waiting at the door that didn't want to let  us enter.  What's wrong with people?  Well, I guess they don't enjoy that.  All the kids that may have been in there shopping for their favorite CDs.  Oh, please.  They wanted to protect them.  Alright.  Well, they're making their way up Broadway, Anthony.  47th and Broadway right now as they try to get to 56th Street.  Sure.  I hear Gloria Ann going high a lot in the background.  Yes.  It's important for her to reach out to the guys at New York's finest. 
[01:32:00]  Of course.  New York's finest.  Huh?  Cool.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Alright, cool.  Rick, we'll check in in a little bit.  You got it.  Yes.  It's so hot.  Peeping away.  Alright, let's go to Mark.  Hey, Mark, what's going on?  I've been waiting for you guys to come here for so long, man.  I come down to the city and work all the time and I'm putting extra days down in the  city just so I can hear you guys.  I'm waiting and dying for you.  Now we are in Albany.  Thank God.  I will spread the word as fast as I can. 
[01:32:30]  I've been calling off everybody I know.  I've got my roommates in here.  I've called my pops.  I'm calling everybody.  Yeah, it's a weird situation with Albany because it's a brand new station.  We put the station on the air today at 3, so no one knows that we're on in Albany at  all.  I will be spreading the word personally.  Yeah, it's going to have to be a word of mouth thing as far as Albany goes.  Happy to hear you guys.  Alright.  Thank you, Mark.  Take care.  Cool.  Bye, Angel.  Mark checking in from Albany, Anthony.  Angel.  So we should talk about the HBO special finally. 
[01:33:00]  Yeah, this is great.  Billy.  This is great.  HBO rules.  Billy, you still there?  What's up, man?  Sorry to make your way.  What's going down, man?  Nothing, but you've got to admit, HBO rocks, man.  Dude, stop.  HBO kicks ass.  You like the hooker special that was on last night?  Oh, is that great, man?  The best is the guy reaching for the balloon knot, you know?  Well, HBO knows how to do this stuff.  They're pros at this.  They have fooled people into believing that these are exposés and they're done with journalistic 
[01:33:30]  integrity.  Documentaries.  Documentary style.  Yeah, right.  This is nothing more than getting porno and lewd acts on television.  And I love it.  And you know something, HBO, they're allowed to show any of that.  You know, they could show this stuff.  Usually, they don't show rated X movies.  You can see that on HBO.  But you could catch the occasional boob and full frontal nudity in the movies they play 
[01:34:00]  on HBO.  But this is a whole new level.  This is hookers and Johns having sex.  Real people.  Real down and dirty, filthy, smelly language.  It's Hunt's Point, Anthony.  Hunt's Point.  I said Hunt's Point.  Hunt.  I want to go there.  It's in the Bronx.  It's in the Bronx?  Yeah.  Named after a Michael Hunt.  As a matter of fact, they called him Mike for short.  That's Mike's Town.  Right.  Good old Mike.  And the hookers there, apparently, they have been chased out of there. 
[01:34:30]  Well, they were chased to there.  From Manhattan.  From Manhattan.  Because they're running rampant.  Problem?  We might have a problem.  What?  What?  Rick.  Rick.  Yeah, we got pulled over here.  Hold on.  We're trying to work things out.  All right.  I appreciate it, sir.  Thank you.  What happened?  What happened, Rick?  Well, that was close.  What happened, Rick?  We had a guy, a couple of officers pull us over and tell us that they wanted to know 
[01:35:00]  if we saw a problem with what we were doing.  And, of course, my response was, what are we doing?  And that just didn't elicit the answer I guess he wanted.  So...  All right.  She's had to cover up for now.  Okay.  And so we can make our way back.  And he's just trying to, as he says, make sure we don't get taken in for anything.  What street are you on?  We are on 50th.  Oh.  Okay.  All right.  So she's now, she now has her... 
[01:35:30]  What did you, what did you asses have a bet when we were going to get picked up?  Yep.  Oh, you dick.  You dick.  You dick.  Who's getting punched in the face first?  Yeah.  Steve, what do you want to punch in the face first?  And we're not, we're not to cut the veal open.  I'll smother him with my frog.  You jerk.  Come on.  Well, I had 45th, Ben had 46th, Ann had 44th, and Jim had 43rd.  Well, nobody wins.  All right.  Not yet. 
[01:36:00]  Only the fine listeners of this radio program.  God damn it.  All right.  And Steve got great video.  He got great video.  And again, we appreciate the officers who came and told us that maybe it would be smarter  not to proceed.  So they gave us a warning and we respect that, I guess.  Yeah.  We have a good relationship with New York's finest.  Exactly.  All right, Rick.  And why jeopardize that?  Yeah, of course.  All right, Rick.  All right, guys.  We'll see you in a few.  All right, of course.  Hey, could someone grab me a coffee?  You're such a dick. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  I just realized we had a pet.  I know.  Then they get mad.  Anyway, so the hooker special on HBO is.  Yeah, so they do it under the guise of a documentary.  What we saw in this special was a lot of oral going on.  A lot of oral by these hookers.  Who was the chick showing off her oral technique for about 30 to 40 seconds?  Yeah.  Car after car after car.  It was one girl at the end of the special.  Doing it as she's standing up. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, she was on with the, like she had little blonde curls or something.  Yeah.  On the front of her hair.  Like one of those bobblehead dolls you get at like a hockey game.  Her head motion was so fast, it was like a woodpecker's head on a tree.  Shirley Temple hair.  Yeah, she had Shirley Temple hair.  And they showed her in various situations.  One, it was through a car window.  They videotaped, I guess.  They used a hidden camera.  And they'd show these girls walking up to the cars.  They'd fuzz out the license plate. 
[01:37:30]  But that's it.  That's it.  So if you saw a car, you know, hey, that Nissan looks familiar with the little dent over  there or something.  It was pretty much giving these guys up.  My kid's an honor student bumper sticker.  Right.  They showed one shot.  It was a silhouette like just the black outline of the shadows.  And you could see the junk in hands.  Oh, yeah.  That was a whole montage they did of her technique.  Right.  And she looked like through the window.  Her head's just going.  She looked like she was a robin trying to get a worm out of the ground. 
[01:38:00]  A worm out of the ground.  A worm out of the ground.  Trying to pull that worm out of the ground.  Like trying to get one of those worms out of like a frozen ground, Anthony.  Yeah.  And he's holding on for dear life.  Robin's got to eat.  Right.  Robin's got to eat.  And they showed her head bobbing up and down through the car window.  Then they show her other guys leaning up against the brick wall.  And she's like bent over kind of sideways.  Yeah.  A little sideways.  Wham, wham, wham, wham, wham.  Just going to town.  I think she's going to need a chiropractor.  Yeah. 
[01:38:30]  Back.  That style.  Hunter Point is in Brooklyn, not the Bronx.  Oh, I'm sorry.  No, Hunt's Point.  Hunt's Point.  Hunt's Point.  I think that was the Bronx.  How could you not know where the hookers are?  Here's the deal.  I've always gotten them on the west side of New York.  I've never ventured into the Bronx because I'm not as familiar with the Bronx real estate  and where they are.  Yeah.  I'm not saying I'm above it.  I just don't know where they are.  Right.  I'd be forever grateful.  All right.  My regular cruises around a car on the west side.  Your regular cruise.  The best part of the special last night?  My regular girl. 
[01:39:00]  No.  The best part of the special last night was the guy, I guess he was getting soul worked  up.  Sounded like he was a big ass mother effer too.  Yeah.  And all of a sudden, you know, the whole confrontation started off with, you know, and how can I explain  this?  Yeah.  It's kind of tough to explain what was going on.  Just being very macho to the hooker.  Yeah.  And by the end of it, she had something going on with this guy where he's admitting everything.  Yeah.  Things he wants to do to other men. 
[01:39:30]  And as she is doing things to him manually and orally, she's doing things.  He asked her to roll a condom onto her finger and then use that on him.  And as she's doing that, he's yelling, oh, my God, I want to.  And then he was talking about satisfy other men.  He's using terminology.  Not other men.  Her man.  Yeah.  You know, who knows who her man is. 
[01:40:00]  Oh, I want to.  I want to suck on this.  And I want to touch and, you know, jumble these around.  And he's getting into graphic detail.  Hustle that.  Hustle that little thing.  Give a little tickle to that.  Right.  You know.  A little rub in a tug here.  A little nuzzle here.  A little nuzzle.  Like, holy ass dude.  Black.  And he asked her.  Jesus.  And he's screaming this.  And then he asks her to put her lower, her bottom.  Yeah.  Right against him. 
[01:40:30]  Yeah.  So he couldn't breathe.  Yeah.  That's a nice request.  That's the only one I really like.  But now, as he's doing it, he wanted to do this.  And he was telling her this because he wanted to imagine that it was her man.  Oh, yeah.  And that he was actually going to do things to yams as they hung down.  The sniffing is nice though.  Oh, God.  It's a hooker.  She's got feelings.  It's a hooker for God's sake. 
[01:41:00]  So she should not be allowed to vote?  Disgusting.  Well, they got morals too.  We learned what they will and won't do.  Right.  What's going on?  Yo, boys.  That might have been the funniest thing I've ever seen on TV.  Wasn't that good?  It was great.  I didn't even know it was on.  I was watching the Eco Challenge, which is great by the way.  But then I'm flipping around and going, oh my God, I'm missing this?  You just couldn't tear yourself away from it.  The best was, I don't know if it was the same big MF-er that you guys are talking about  that was in like an Explorer or something.  And he's sitting there haggling with the broad.  Yeah. 
[01:41:30]  Come on, baby.  If I finish too fast, it ain't going to cost me 40 now, is it?  Yeah.  And she's just sitting at 40 and she's getting all pissed.  Yeah.  Oh, it's still going to cost you 40.  Oh, come on, baby.  It's just too fast.  I didn't even enjoy myself.  What about the hooker for 30 bucks gets all pissed off because the guy wants to do  a little touchy-feely and she's not into that and finally leaves the car.  Double.  All pissed off.  Yeah, this girl got so pissed.  She's going, get your hands up.  Don't, don't you pull on me like that.  Because I guess he was pulling her head.  Oh, yeah.  That was hilarious.  Like grabbing the side of her head. 
[01:42:00]  And she goes, don't you pull on me like that.  Don't you pull on me.  And he goes, and she's like, I told you to keep your finger out of there.  Yeah.  And she was mentioning the dirty spot.  The balloon knot.  Yeah.  Did you see that truck rocking back and forth, though?  Yeah.  My God.  The SUV.  That was hilarious.  Slamming.  The one old broad that couldn't get a date for her life and it's like 4 o'clock in the  morning and that same car kept pulling up and probably sold out for 4 bucks for a  Hummer.  What about the voice guy just rhyming everything?  Perfect.  At Hunts. 
[01:42:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  That girl who was a Destiny.  Oh, yeah.  She looked like she probably commands a couple of bucks.  And then they're talking to her and it's like 40 bucks.  I think the guy was going to give her 40 bucks for some oral action and the full deed.  Yeah.  The, like, slammer.  That was so funny, though.  God.  You start off with the Sopranos, six feet under, and then the comedy really starts.  Hell yeah.  My God.  How many tickets?  Um, are you? 
[01:43:00]  I hate to grovel, man, but you know, it's probably their last home game.  Are you a Kid Rock fan?  Yeah.  Bigger Flyers fan.  Huge.  Huge Flyers fan, man.  You guys really hooked us up today with great ratings in Philly.  Dude, you know what the funny thing is?  When you guys start that here...  This is what I got left.  I got a pair of tickets to OzFest.  Yeah, I'll take them.  Dude, that's huge, man.  You're on.  Got a pair of tickets that sold out with WYSP OzFest July 12th at the Tweeter Center in Camden,  New Jersey.  Yeah, you guys rock.  Norton, you still rule.  Thank you, fella.  Of course he does. 
[01:43:30]  Chris, hold on the line.  We'll give you the OzFest tickets, and once again, thanks for supporting the show in Philly.  You guys kick ass, man.  I've been with you since day one down here.  We got great news from Philly today, and we greatly appreciate it.  Thanks, boys.  We needed a little pick-me-up today.  Ah, any time, man.  All right, Chris.  But no reach around, though.  Thanks.  And Keith the Cop has some great...  Oh, yeah.  Well, I heard a couple of stories thanks to Ben.  I heard a couple of stories about what Keith used to have to do.  Now, where was this, Keith?  This was, we'll say, someplace in the city. 
[01:44:00]  Okay, let's just say someplace in the city.  And...  You actually had to go out on hooker detail?  Yeah, I've gone out on hooker detail a few times.  Where are you?  Now, why don't you explain your hooker detail?  Yeah, because I would think...  Now, just hearing that, I would think like I'd watched on an episode of Cops.  Here's an officer along with other officers in maybe a hotel room.  Right next door is another hotel room.  The girl cop is dressed like a hooker.  She goes out, gets a guy, brings him into the room. 
[01:44:30]  They negotiate the price.  He says some phrase.  She goes, okay, come on in.  And the cops bust in and grab the guy.  Now, Keith, that must be what you mean by hooker detail, right?  Well, no, I've actually never done hooker detail like that.  No, no?  Then, my goodness, whatever do you mean?  We've done some street hooker detail, and...  Oh, yeah?  Like you're making believe you're a John there?  Well...  Or a pimp or something?  Well, yeah, we do things like that sometimes. 
[01:45:00]  Well, if it wasn't a pimp or a John, I can't imagine what else they would have to have you portray.  Well, there are certain areas, well, let's say that...  Keith, let me visualize.  So, you make believe you're a married guy from Jersey.  You're coming into the city for a little tale.  There's the hot female hookers.  Right.  And you pull up, and then what happens?  Um, well, some places they're not necessarily women, as little Jimmy might know.  You betcha.  Oh, oh, my God. 
[01:45:30]  And, you know, there is occasion.  And let me tell you something.  Yes.  The guys that are coming in from out of town,  It doesn't matter how hot that this person might be.  Yeah.  They know.  And I mean, you'll get...  They know that they're guys.  Yeah.  And you'll get the guys with the car seats and the back seat and, you know...  Oh, so like they got their family vehicle where they might take their young child to go get some ice cream.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Keith, don't they have to get you saying something sexual for money or something? 
[01:46:00]  Because I'm really...  I'm vague.  I never discuss anything.  And if somebody wants to go for...  I just say, hey, you want to come for a ride?  And they're like, what do you want?  I'm like, I just, if you want to come for a ride, I will never say anything until they're in the car.  Little Jimmy, haven't we had this discussion before about what to say and what not to say?  It's not about you, douchebag.  Well, it's not...  It's about educating people out there who may want to...  I'm not the only guy in the car.  No, you're using our radio show to get info so you don't get freaking arrested.  Hold Keith on your own goddamn time.  I want to ask Keith this, though.  Okay.  Yeah, this is a much better story that he's about to tell here. 
[01:46:30]  Well...  He cruises for guys.  So, Keith, you have to dress up as a hooker.  No, no, well, what happened was there are locations where...  Dude, tell me you drive up undercover trying to think of other dudes.  Please tell me.  Yeah, they have done that.  Boy, how come that isn't on the NYPD promotion for recruits tape I've seen at the movie theaters and on television?  They have to be dressed up like a hooker. 
[01:47:00]  No, we don't dress up like...  He's the guy in the car looking for dudes.  Looking for dudes.  Yeah, yeah.  Wait, wait.  Are you the guy...  No, wait a minute.  Not even trainees, dude.  Hold on.  I would almost give that one to you.  You're talking about just regular male...  Okay, wait, wait, wait.  Now we're confusing so many stories together.  Hold on, hold on.  If I'm confused, the listeners are going to be Keith.  Keith.  We're confusing too many stories together.  Are you posing as the person looking to get money for sex or the person looking to pay for money? 
[01:47:30]  I have done both.  Okay, so he has been the guy.  Okay, you have been the guy.  Now, how do you dress like a young cruiser out there looking...  Well, when you're cruising in a car, you're just in a car.  Yeah, but how do you dress like a young stud hustler from the street?  Standing on the street corner, do you leave your underpants at home?  No, no, no.  Do you have Dustin Hoffman cutting your hammers?  There are certain locations where it's just like regular dudes just standing out there.  And then what happens?  Do you pack a pickle?  Well, you know, I happen to have been standing there one time.  And I've actually only done this once. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah.  Once is...  Once was more than enough.  Exactly.  I agree.  Like, you get talked into these things because nobody else wants to do it.  And you know, you want to be a team player.  And the popular GM of a radio station pulls up.  Says it's Ken Stevens.  He's had a tough week.  He's had a tough week here.  Figured, what the hell?  Ah, you're cute.  And so I happen to be standing out there.  And it's very slow moving.  But finally, this dude comes up and... 
[01:48:30]  Did you get butterflies?  Like, ooh, this one likes sweet.  Or did you start feeling fat when they just drove past?  You know, you feel very unwanted.  You're like, oh.  What's wrong with me, right?  Hey, you son of a bitch.  I'm hot.  You got rejected by freakin' husbands and bastards.  So this guy comes walking up to me and, you know, he asked me how much.  Oh, no.  For what, Keith?  Did he say for what?  Well, you know, and I happen to...  You know, I...  Now you gotta do your job. 
[01:49:00]  You gotta ask him the right question.  I told him for an oral...  I told him for an oral treat.  It would be 25.  You cheap bastard.  You are.  Now, Keith.  Now you got some self-esteem.  Really, dude?  You got to be worth at least 50.  The point of the story is...  You got it pretty now.  So, dude, what happened?  After you do it, they arrest him?  Yeah, you gotta catch him in the eye.  Oh, God.  Yeah.  Wait a minute.  You're a bust, dude. 
[01:49:30]  Keith, what's wrong with you?  What's wrong with you?  You got low self-esteem?  Well, what it comes down to is now, what happens is the guy...  Hey, Keith, what was the code word you used to get all the other guys to come in and get  the guy?  Why?  Well, the whole time he's going...  Oh, okay.  He's got to hurry up.  You realize the tape is off?  I can't.  You realize he's off from work that day.  Hey, wait.  I'm not even working today.  That's hilarious.  No, no, no.  You know what?  I called... 
[01:50:00]  No, geez, I'm sorry.  Okay.  I'm waking up beating like I did.  No, no.  Keep up.  It is very funny.  It is very funny.  Oh, yes.  It's Tuesday.  I'm not supposed to be working.  That's cool.  All right.  So now you say 25 for treats.  I say 25.  Right.  Right.  Now he turns around and says, well, how much for an oral treat for you?  Oh, like he wanted to service you.  Right.  So now I'm like, oh, my God. 
[01:50:30]  I'm like, what the hell is that all about?  You know?  Tell me the price list that rolls home for this one.  I'm like, you know, so I tell him 35.  Oh, look at you.  Thank you.  But I mean, if you were a gay guy out on the street and you're getting an oral treat  and getting money, I mean, it's like a win-win situation, don't you think?  I think that price would be cheaper than you having to give.  And that was going through your head?  I think you screwed up, Keith.  Well, basically what happened was, you know, it was.  He said 15.  Yeah.  You're not supposed to haggle. 
[01:51:00]  So I accepted his proposition.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  I gave the code for move in for...  The code for sea sucker?  To arrest this gentleman.  Is the code pulling down his zipper and going to town?  When the guy was done, did he ask for his Ticketmaster charge back?  That was funny.  But they move in, they arrested him. 
[01:51:30]  Hey, Keith, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Boy, they arrest this gentleman.  Boy, this Keith really gets into his job.  So they roll up then and arrest him.  We arrest this gentleman and...  Do they have to make like they're arresting you so...  Yeah, yeah.  So it doesn't blow your cover?  Right.  Blow his cover.  Well, basically, I mean, we were out there for a long time.  So this ended up being the only person that we caught doing this, I guess.  Oh, you didn't get any more dates?  But how close did you get to, you know, an uncomfortable situation? 
[01:52:00]  Because I'm thinking if I'm one of your pals and I'm on the job, I'm going to make you sweat a little bit before we show up.  Oh, now it sucks.  Did you get that?  All right, well, come on.  Did you get that?  Everybody is...  Follow me.  Everybody is pretty close to the whole situation.  We're the guys.  Serrano's got the discs.  Serrano's got the discs.  Serrano's got the discs.  All right.  So they move in, you know, they lock the guy up, and then, you know, I was taken back, and I had never done this before, so I was talking to one of the guys who does this on a normal basis, and I said, dude, this guy wanted to give me money to, you know, take care of me. 
[01:52:30]  Yeah.  And they said, you know, that's a regular thing.  Really?  Yeah, so, you know, when we got back to the station house, I said to this guy, I go, uh...  Oh, no, you talked to him?  Yeah, well, I came in, and I was pretending I had my hands cut behind my back and everything, you know, and I'm like, dude, you know, what happened?  I'm like, you know, what, what, what?  And I said, uh, I said, where did you just come from?  And the guy ended up, he was in some gay bar. 
[01:53:00]  So it's like...  So he was getting all worked up?  Yeah, but I don't understand if you're in a gay bar.  Yeah, we got audio of Keith as he's in the alleyway.  Oh!  Yeah.  Don't just stare at it.  Eat it.  Well, so I said, where are you coming from?  And he said he was in a gay bar.  So, like, if you're in a gay bar with a bunch of gay guys, what are you going outside to pay some dudes to, you know...  Yeah, well, maybe he was a little shy.  Maybe he's a little shy.  Yeah. 
[01:53:30]  That's all.  So, you know, he said it was really like the thrill of it, you know?  I heard Keith got a little angry at the guy.  Yeah.  Well, what ended up happening was...  He's not gonna stop.  Hold on, hold on.  I want to hear the tape, but when you got a little angry with him.  You can act like a man!  Like a man!  Police brutality.  He hit him.  Oh, well.  So, finally...  Well, we got audio of the gay guy.  Yeah.  Stop that. 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  I suck it!  Really?  I suck it!  Hey, Keith, did you have him on tape?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you got tape?  Oh, man.  Finally, the end of the whole story was I had my hands behind my back pretending like  I was cuffed until they pulled out his money and started counting it, and he had $85 in  his pocket, and I got pissed off that he only offered me $15.  Oh, see?  He had some more money.  You know, then I felt cheap.  He didn't think you were hot.  Funny. 
[01:54:30]  She would have trussled your hair while you did it.  So that was just one of the many stories, but I would say that that is the best.  I got Keith's pickup line, Anthony.  Oh, yeah, really?  Yeah.  I like charging gas!  Well, this guy sounds...  We got a tape of one of the guys that wanted sex.  Yeah.  He's got a strange request, and he sounds familiar.  He's my hair, fuck boy!  Huh.  How much would that cost?  And then he gets a little brutal with the guy.  You stupid faggot! 
[01:55:00]  Hmm.  Then I guess he's at the police station.  He explains how he got into this whole life.  I drink beer until I pass out!  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah!  Well, I got more audio key.  Oh, of course you do.  You're a little bitch.  That's right.  You're a bitch, and I bet you'd like to suck it, wouldn't you?  Yeah.  Wow, Keith's really getting into it as he does the undercover thing.  Yeah, he didn't care.  Oh, you like that?  Don't you faggot? 
[01:55:30]  You know, sometimes you just take a little bit more of a beating than you need to.  More audio of Keith the cop.  Don't squeeze it!  You know, first you get abused about the EverQuest thing.  Yeah.  Then you go to this whole thing.  That's interesting.  That voice sounds a little familiar, and he was offering you 50 bucks to do this.  Can we see your stuff?  Oh, wow!  That voice sounds so easy! 
[01:56:00]  It's not fun anymore.  All right.  All right, yeah.  Very good.  Well, Keith, thank God you're keeping in the streets.  Well, you know, and now of course I've got to give the EverQuest plug why I'm here.  Of course you do.  You are so addicted.  You don't have to count for anything to plug or eatabullet.com.  Give your name.  But Bay Victus and Vantor and Talari.  Got to say hello to them on the INA Row server.  Salvin, send me a...  My name is Salvin.  Send me a little towel and free t-shirts autographed by owner. 
[01:56:30]  I got audio of the guy that picked up Keith, Anthony.  Yeah.  Virgin.  Oh, he could spot that a mile away.  How would he know that?  I don't know.  Real funny.  All right.  Must be Keith's tight ass in those male hooker jeans he ought to wear.  Here's Keith's fellow officers watching from afar, Anthony, waiting for the sign.  Uh-huh.  They're looking through their binoculars.  Right.  And I do believe they had this to say.  It looks like I'm a rat.  He's in the hole!  Oh, it didn't get that far. 
[01:57:00]  And then the one thing, Keith is standing on the corner and I guess at one point he tried  to stand with his hips out a little to attract a little more guys and a guy driving by yelled  this at him.  Is that supposed to be sexy?  And I guess it wasn't.  Two guys fighting over Keith?  Hello, my brother.  You've got to buy your own.  Wow.  Mule.  How about a nice bucket of eggs? 
[01:57:30]  Oh, Keith, relax.  I don't want to get the eggs, fellas.  All right, fellas.  I'm out of here.  I'll catch on you later.  All right, Keith.  See ya.  There he goes.  There goes Keith the cop, everyone.  As a male hooker.  You know damn well he dressed a little different.  They play cologne?  Yeah, yeah.  He just makes it sound like he just went out there.  Like, oh, I'm doing that.  Let me walk out.  He had to think about something.  Maybe Keith's fellow officers could call us and tell us what they think Keith was wearing. 
[01:58:00]  Yeah, what do the guys got to wear?  You're not just going out there like you're regular, you know, you usually do.  Look at him, shooting them jeans.  Wearing them tight jeans.  He put a thong to his party.  He put a thong to his party.  Wow, that's old school.  Ron, what's up?  Hey, ONA.  Hey.  What's going on?  Keith is gone, but I wanted to ask him if when a guy offers to perform on him, if the  code word for the other cops move in is...  On your knees. 
[01:58:30]  All right, Ant.  Well, we still got to play the audio from the HBO special.  Yeah, we got some audio of that.  Hookers just make for great shows.  You know something?  We should...  Somebody brought it up.  We should try to just get one of those girls down here, see how much money we could  give her to do things to herself.  Not a bad idea.  Oh, no, thank you.  Because we found out there's a whole moral thing that they have.  They actually have some, like, guidelines and lines that you cannot cross. 
[01:59:00]  They will sit there and hob it and let you slam them in these vehicles and put things  places.  But some of them don't grab their head and don't give the reach around the back area unless  you're giving them more money or, you know...  They can't even cop a feel.  Right.  A few of the hookers were, like, in red.  Like, hey, don't touch my chest when you're...  Well, where the hell do you think you are?  I just paid. 
[01:59:30]  What about the girl that's hobbing the knob?  And she goes, no, I don't lick yambag.  She wanted...  The guy's like, yo, baby, why don't you lick my beep, you know?  Yeah.  And she goes, no, I don't lick that.  Maybe he stunk and she was trying to be polite.  You're a hooker!  Pay!  That's not me, it's key.  You pay...  Hookers aren't supposed to have more.  No.  You know something?  If you're in the car and you just paid this bitch some money, she better lick the sack.  It looked good.  Lick it!  Lick it, Jim!  My regular will not even... 
[02:00:00]  This is true.  One of the things I like about her.  Will not allow me to lick certain parts of body that are...  Above the waist?  Yeah.  She won't let you lick there?  No, just touch.  No saliva transfer at all.  Hummer with bag.  Right.  And I'm finished in three minutes, four minutes, we're under.  Amazing.  You go on a date and you throw food at a girl's chops.  And how much does that run you?  Forty.  Forty bucks?  She's great.  She's one of the sexiest people ever.  And she...  Totally cleaner than any girl you're going to pick up at a club. 
[02:00:30]  Won't even touch my mule without a bag.  Won't even touch her.  Really?  Nothing.  How long has she been in the business?  I don't know, but she's a wonderful, wonderful girl.  Can we get her on the line?  No.  Incognito?  I would love to.  Fake names.  Yeah, yeah.  We'll totally cover it up.  She isn't giving her real name.  I don't know her real name.  I just know the name she gives me.  Are we allowed to give this girl like just, I don't know, a hundred bucks for just helping  us with our show?  We'll give her like a hundred bucks just to get her on the air.  We got her on the phone now?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you doing, Daddy? 
[02:01:00]  Hi.  How are you?  I'll meet you in the stairwell.  Dude, I would love to talk to your regular hooker on the show.  I can't do it now because I don't have her number.  If she's freaked out, we'll even change the voice.  We'll do stupid radio if we have to.  She doesn't work for the CIA.  She gives hummers.  All right.  Any other action you get from her?  Just that.  You could?  What does she charge for a full plowing?  I don't know.  How do you not know?  I'm telling you.  I've only been in the car.  No.  I'm too paranoid in cars.  I don't, you know, all the way. 
[02:01:30]  It's just too much.  If a cop pulls up, what are you going to do?  Oh, yeah.  Like he's not going to know when.  You could see through a rear view mirror or something.  A cop's driving up the street and just go, oh, head up.  Zip her up.  You know, it's a lot harder to pull your slacks up and hop over the console again.  You know, it's a lot easier just to zip your trousers back up.  Right.  And have her lift her head and just smile like you're talking.  Okay.  I'm telling you, I'm very paranoid.  He's street savvy.  I see that.  I see that.  That's why I've never been busted.  I'm careful.  I like that.  I like that Norton is our street connection like this. 
[02:02:00]  I'm not sloppy.  To the dirtier, seatier sides of our streets.  I don't say, like that guy that pulled up the key.  If I was talking to a girl, I would never have said something stupid like that.  Ever.  You want to go for a ride?  Well, what do you want to do?  I don't know.  Just talk.  No, I need to.  Okay, bye.  Oh, really?  I passed up tens.  I'm in the car first.  Of course.  And then as you're driving, you discuss things?  I'm not a cop.  You could be a cop.  She's real lighthearted.  And if they touch mule or whatever, because a female is not going to rub mule if she's  a cop.  Right.  Can you mind if I touch you?  And they're always like, no, baby. 
[02:02:30]  And you just touch.  And then you know.  Of course you know.  Interesting.  This is fascinating.  Your dirty, dirty world.  A lot of guys are stupid, man.  A lot of guys will pull right up and go, hey, how much for help, man?  And all they got to do is run the tape.  Right.  But there's nothing illegal about pulling up to a high girl and going, you want to go for  a ride?  I figure they have to take it.  Right up until you kill her.  Then it's illegal.  Anthony, we got Rocco checking in.  Oh, Rocco?  Hey, Rocco.  Hey, Rocco.  Hey, don't be unfunny.  How's it going?  What's up, schlockhole? 
[02:03:00]  Hey, I want to know if there's any chance of keep the crotch transfer into Worcester.  Why?  35 is a good deal.  Oh.  Wait, for you to give him oral papers?  Yeah.  All I ask is a little jaw rub later.  Really?  Yeah.  A little rub down from my jaw, but that's all.  Hey, Rocco, you know you're live on our show, right?  What?  Whoa.  Hey, guys.  Yeah.  Take me off the air.  Hold on.  That's not funny.  That's not funny at all.  What?  Talk to me off the air. 
[02:03:30]  What?  You know that?  But Rocco, this sounds like one of your great fake bits.  Oh, come on.  That's not even funny, isn't it?  This isn't going to help your ratings by admitting that you might like guys.  We don't know that for sure.  Yeah.  Has anyone seen the pictures from the studio?  Well, a lot of man ass.  A lot of man ass.  I think this is just another desperate move by yourself to try to get your ratings up there.  I'm in Jamaica.  What do you mean?  I don't need desperate moves.  All right, Rocco.  We're hanging. 
[02:04:00]  All right.  And as long as cheese tastes like crisp apples, I'm fine with it.  All right.  All right, Rocco.  Yeah.  Take it easy, Rocco.  We don't know if Rocco goes that way, Anthony.  Do it.  I don't know.  I have no idea, but that guy who said he was Rocco, he seems to think that he would pay  35 bucks to be able to give oral treats to another man.  Hmm.  Whatever.  Sounded like the guy.  I don't know. 
[02:04:30]  All right.  We got more audio from the HBO whore special.  The whore.  Was it called the whore special?  I don't know.  Also, you know what?  I think next we got to get Sandy Kane in here real fast.  Because she's got the sounds she makes in her cribs.  If you want to see Sandy Kane Cribs, it's on foundrymusic.com.  It is just another brilliant installment of our Cribs series that we've been doing for  a while now.  We had our own Jimmy Norton did Cribs. 
[02:05:00]  Stalker Patty was our first Cribs we did a while back.  And the latest installment is Sandy Kane.  It is disgusting, sad.  It runs the gamut of emotions, Opie.  The end when one is the loneliest number is playing as the music in the background.  And you guys are pulling out and all you see is this long shot.  It's almost like a Kubrick shot going down the hallway.  And Sandy Kane in the background by her door. 
[02:05:30]  Again, completely alone as she has been for so long in that apartment.  Unbelievable.  That was a great job.  That was a great shot.  And I've got to thank Jeff from foundrymusic.com.  He found his niche throwing up at strip bars and doing this crib thing.  It just seems to be his forte.  Great job.  Why are you going from the gorgeous, hot Gloria to this monster?  Because that's what we do.  That's why we're pathetic.  That's why we do what we do.  That's why we have a good radio show.  Isn't it like cleansing the palate from a fine filet mignon with dog crap? 
[02:06:00]  You want to cleanse the palate?  You want to get that taste out of your mouth?  Well, yeah, not with that though.  Well, Gloria Ann is still in the building, so maybe we'll have her just topless as Sandy Kane sings her Robert Blake song, Anthony.  Is it true if they get too close to each other, the whole universe will implode?  They are so complete opposites.  They are so perfectly, completely opposite that if they come together, it's over.  We've talked about this in the past.  I mean, you know, God's a funny man, you know?  Oh, load of laughs.  You mix up the DNA two different ways and look what you get. 
[02:06:30]  You can either get a Gloria Ann, hot as all hell, or a Sandy Kane.  I heard after he met Sandy Kane, he went...  He thought it was that funny.  That DNA is quite a thing there.  God put her out there and went...  Wax zany God.  All right, so she's got a Robert Blake song.  Ah, well, very...  It's going to sound like every other song she has done, but...  Robert Blake!  Robert Blake!  Robert Blake! 
[02:07:00]  Robert Blake!  Robert Blake!  He is a flake!  Robert Blake!  Yeah.  What?  Minus the hygiene.  So we got Hooker Audio.  Right.  Sandy Kane with the Robert Blake song.  Uh-huh.  More of your phone calls.  And other things, I guess.  Right.  Anthony.  He's a son of a bitch!  Anthony.  That guy's a rapist.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show, 1027. 
[02:07:30]  WNEW.  And we're back with the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got to catch up there, sorry.  We do 45 minutes of straight radio.  Well, we got to catch up on the back end.  Yeah, it takes a little while.  Well, we're back.  Once again, I want to say hi to the five people listening to us in Albany today, Anthony.  Albany.  We put a brand new station on the air in Albany.  They just got the transmitter and everything.  But no one really knows we're on the air yet.  Yeah.  It's going to have to be a word of mouth thing in Albany.  Also, once again, a fifth of the Opie and Anthony Show.  We got to catch up there, sorry.  We got to catch up there, sorry.  We got to catch up there, sorry.  We got to catch up on the back end.  We got to catch up on the back end.  We got to catch up on the air in Albany.  They just got the transmitter and everything.  But no one really knows we're on the air yet. 
[02:08:00]  It's going to have to be a word of mouth thing in Albany.  Also, once again, a big, big, huge thank you to Philly.  Thank you so much.  And once again, supporting the show.  Tim was on earlier, the program director down there in Philly on WYSB.  And our ratings went through the effing room.  Yeah.  Like insane.  All right, we still have a lot to do before we get out of here. 
[02:08:30]  We got Sandy Kane.  We got Gloria Ann doing a photo shoot, Anthony.  That's going to be un-effing believable.  A photo shoot.  Gloria Ann is literally the hottest blonde I've ever seen in my life.  We have video of her just walking topless in the middle of Times Square that we're putting up on foundrymusic.com.  F-O-U-N-D-R-Y music.com.  The link is up on opianthony.com to the underground website we call foundrymusic.com. 
[02:09:00]  And now, if that's not good enough, Rick is taking some still shots.  And we're going to put those up on foundrymusic.com and maybe elsewhere.  And also, we have a shot of her on the Stinky Cam right now.  We can't get enough footage of the lovely Gloria Ann.  Her back is even sexy.  You like that back?  It's just all of it.  Is it wide enough for you, though?  I know you like those big, wide, manly backs when you're getting those treats.  I certainly don't.  Are you done with the photo shoot, Rick?  I certainly don't.  Now that you've gone through four clips, remember how everyone mocked the little red, real-world-looking ottoman that they got for the outside green room here? 
[02:09:30]  The Ikea furniture.  The Ikea furniture.  And everyone mocked and mocked and mocked that little ottoman.  The little ottoman that could was mocked.  Now it is used in all the hot photo shoots.  I'm using that mainly as my main setup now.  Oh, that's your main setup?  That's my main backdrop for the ladies to pose on.  When you had Gloria Ann's lovely cans just propped over the ottoman like that, and she's kind of just laying on it. 
[02:10:00]  Beautiful.  Wait until you see these shots.  All right.  I'm going to love them.  Well, why don't we go from one extreme to the other?  Let's get the star of the latest version of Cribs, the radio version of Cribs that Ant and I do from time to time.  It's Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane.  Sandy Kane.  Here she comes.  Make sure...  Awesome, Garrett. 
[02:10:30]  Make sure she stays way over there.  Move that mic even further.  Yes, yes.  I need her at a complete, the furthest distance possible from me.  She just dropped more cards.  You dropped something, Mary.  Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo.  Look at Jared's hair, billowing out.  They're little butterfingers.  Look at him.  He takes his hat off.  You just want to run over and start tussling, don't you?  Thanks.  Stop taking pictures, Sandy.  It's for more of her shrine in our house, which we learned from Cribs. 
[02:11:00]  I know.  You can download her episode of Cribs on FoundryMusic.com.  My building will never be the same.  Oh, since you moved in.  It's O and A.  True.  People say how'd you get in there?  You get in there.  Sandy, Sandy, those cockroaches that are running around your apartment and the dirt, the soil it looked like that was on top of your refrigerator.  My eyes were clean, though.  No, they weren't.  Hey, Anthony, I just want to ask Gloria Ann something.  Why are you down here, Rick?  Oh, my God.  Rick went to bend down to grab something. 
[02:11:30]  He doesn't do that.  That was a little lower.  Hey, Gloria Ann.  Do you see what's going to happen to you at midnight?  Oh, stop it.  Oh, you guys.  I love that joke.  That's all right.  Wow.  That was what, I mean, if somebody put a curse on you, that's what would happen.  It went on.  It went on.  No, you know what it looks like?  Remember that great Star Trek episode when they went to the planet and started aging?  You guys should be naked. 
[02:12:00]  What about all the stories where, like, you know, one, and then, like, you know, the prince and the frog, and really it's like, you know, yeah, it could be like that.  She can't get a frog to kiss her.  Yeah, I have nice ones, too.  They're double teeth.  You know what?  You don't have to take your clothes off.  No, you keep those on, Sandy.  Why not?  The twatto's here.  No, we got that taken care of today with Gloria.  She doesn't have a twatto.  Thank God.  Your body should be in a bicycle basket in front of the moon.  It's awful.  What's wrong with my body, though? 
[02:12:30]  What about yours?  What?  He admits that his body's awful.  What about yours, I bet?  I bet he isn't even well in dad.  All right, listen, Sandy, we don't have much time today for your nonsense.  But look at the contrast.  It's amazing.  It is amazing.  But Phil does in love with her.  Phil does in love with her.  He's leaving me for her.  Once again, Ann, you mix up that DNA one way, you get Gloria, and you mix it up another way, and opiates exactly the same ingredients.  Right.  It's the same composition of carbon-based life unit. 
[02:13:00]  Same proportions of chemicals.  It breathes the same way, I think.  I think Sandy Kane's DNA was left out on the radiator too long.  Was that it?  Went sour?  Went sour.  But such a subtle thing can make such a lovely, sexy woman, or Exit 7 on the West Shore Expressway.  All right, Sandy, what do you got for us today?  I got dildos here, and I also got, like, this Robert Blake. 
[02:13:30]  I'm very much into this story.  Are you?  You're into the Robert Blake story?  Yeah, really.  Now, why are you so into this, Sandy Kane?  Well, because when it first came out, it was so obvious he did this.  Oh!  Using your law skills and your criminal justice?  No, I am a pro se lawyer, by the way.  Oh, really?  But, no, just like, he barked under a dark light.  He had every motive to kill her.  Did you say you're a lawyer?  A pro se lawyer.  What is that?  Well, I... 
[02:14:00]  You're an ass.  You're not a lawyer.  I'm an ass, too.  She'll just grunt like that.  No, I'm her.  Well, what I'm saying is, for my Comedy Central lawsuit, I represented myself, and now I have  Milbank Tweedy.  What?  What lawsuit?  I have an $11 million lawsuit against Comedy Central.  Oh, that's right.  The Daily Show.  The Daily Show.  Why?  Did somebody get up?  Of course.  And yell, hey, Sandy Kane, put your goddamn clothes back on.  Why do you...  No, they had me on for six months on the bumper, so... 
[02:14:30]  They had video of her on their bumper, and she's suing them for $11 million.  How do you justify those type of damages?  And what was the video of you?  It was the bumper of a segment called Public Excess, and I was on the bumper of it.  They used to look at public access shows and show clips, and it was funny, you know,  and then they'd show, like, Sandy Kane and all laugh, and it was great.  They even used I Love Dick, my theme song.  Right, yeah, and it's a good time to check, yeah. 
[02:15:00]  You're doing comedy, aren't you?  Yeah, but after 600 times, they were very mad.  Comedy Central's not funny.  I'll agree with that, but you're not going to make $11 million.  You live in a Roche-invested place.  Take 50 bucks and show it.  All right.  Whatever I make, man.  Whatever I make.  So how did you assume that you were a lawyer?  No, well, no one...  I couldn't get a lawyer, so I went down to the pro se down there, and...  Pro se?  Pro se means you represent yourself.  Right.  So I represented myself, did all the papers, and I finally got Milbank Tweed, which is 
[02:15:30]  the biggest law firm in the country.  I requested to the judge for a lawyer, and he got me the biggest law firm in the country,  Milbank Tweed.  Oh, yeah.  We've all heard of that.  No, I haven't seen a pig.  Who are you with?  It's the judge of the weed.  See the Johnny Cochran or...  Yeah.  That's funny law firm.  Marilyn Spears, Benner, and Ziggy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The honeymoon is kind of day, ain't it?  Hey, Jim, what's up?  Hey, I wanted to know if Sandy was upset that Robert Blake caught her twin sister, that pig. 
[02:16:00]  Oh, don't talk of the dead like that.  All right, so what do we got today?  The Robert Blake thing, look how ugly she is, too.  She makes me look pretty.  No, she doesn't.  Well, just stop it.  She was an ugly-looking woman.  Yeah.  You know, would you go to bed with her?  Yeah.  I would, actually.  Okay.  I'd work that.  She's trying...  Anyway, would you kill her, too?  Maybe.  Maybe.  And I think it's an incredible case.  She sounded like she deserved it, to tell you the truth. 
[02:16:30]  Uh-huh.  Like, I would never justify murder, but it sounds like if somebody was going to kill somebody,  she kind of deserved it.  What, were you thinking of killing your wife?  No.  Because I saw you in the paper with your wife.  No, I didn't do that.  She was pretty, yeah.  Your wife was pretty.  We were nice walking down the courtroom steps.  Yeah, it was a good picture.  Why would I...  No, no.  And let me tell you something, if we could keep her quiet for a second.  And Robert Blake is an idiot.  He's a jerk.  He is stupid.  What he could have done, this man had a license to carry a firearm, right? 
[02:17:00]  So, he goes to dinner with her.  They go to the restaurant.  He has this gun with him.  You get out in the car.  You go, I can't drive with the gun here.  It's on my hip.  You pull it out.  Boom!  You blow her friggin' head off.  Then you say, oh my God!  You run back to the restaurant.  Hold on, Norton.  You run back to the restaurant in shock, screaming and crying, oh my God, the gun went off, the gun went off. 
[02:17:30]  No matter what they say, you always claim that it was a goddamn accident.  The gun went off.  You're going to get, maybe, you're going to get involuntary manslaughter.  And you get a couple of years.  Or public service if you're a celebrity.  The guy was stupid.  Here's why I disagree with you.  Why, Jim Norton?  Because they had obvious conflict.  Nobody would have bought it.  Because there's no...  I don't know what the...  Doesn't matter.  Nobody would have bought it. 
[02:18:00]  Reasonable doubt.  If you...  If you...  You don't tell anyone.  You don't tell anybody.  You don't go looking for a killer.  And then when you decide...  Too many...  Enough people have heard you say you want to kill her.  You do it.  This is something he could have pulled off as a complete accident.  And ballistics could have checked.  They could check angles and trajectory.  Right.  In order to get a kill shot, you might have to go straight to the head.  They might say, well, exactly how did that happen in the sitting position?  Oh, I understand.  I'm not saying it would have been easy.  I told him that.  I'm sure that theory would have worked, too.  Right. 
[02:18:30]  It's a lot better than him filing the numbers off a gun and shooting her in the head himself  with the goddamn gun.  The guy was on a cop show.  He doesn't understand that you could raise the goddamn serial numbers back.  She looks that way.  If she looks that way and he's doing it himself and he pops through the trajectories off,  it just wouldn't have worked out.  She could have looked anyway.  He's getting in the car.  He's muscling around to get his gun out.  And then all of a sudden...  Right.  Muscling around.  Muscling around.  He's trying to get the gun out.  I can't even get a lot of balls to do it.  It works better than shooting her in the head, throwing the gun away, and going, 
[02:19:00]  I didn't know nothing.  I didn't do it.  I walked in.  Oh, I dropped my gun in the restaurant.  Oh, come on, she's dead.  There's reasonable doubt enough where you absolutely know it wouldn't have been a capital case.  Right now, he's sitting on maybe a capital murder charge.  See, I think this one, these reasonable doubt, unless they have somebody who saw him do it,  or they have his prints on the gun, or they have a...  It's his gun, first of all.  It's his serial number.  It's his goddamn gun.  They don't know that.  No, they do.  They found the gun, they raised the serial number, and it was registered to him. 
[02:19:30]  He owned that gun.  And the bullets...  He's an idiot.  He had bullets in his apartment.  No, no, that is what I heard.  I heard that he had this thing with a guy, they traced it back to the original owner,  but it was sold at a gun show, and the guy said he remembered selling it to Robert Blake,  but there was no paperwork.  There's a connection between him and the gun, regardless.  But they're going to bring him on trial, they're going to bring that guy.  There's no paperwork, but he said Robert Blake, he sold it to him.  He should have gone with the accident.  Or he should have got rid of the gun better.  You don't just throw the gun in the dumpster where your car is parked.  Why don't you just hand it to a cop?  Hold this. 
[02:20:00]  You shoot her, you go to Boston, you say black guys did it, and you jump off the bridge.  Black guy did it, Boston.  At least he fed her before he killed her.  What was his name?  Willie Willie.  Charles Stewart.  Leave it.  Just sparking up that Boston friggin' racist stereotype.  A black guy did it.  If he got rid of that gun properly, he would not be in this jam right now,  because without a murder weapon, it's very tough.  He told too many people.  He had solicited people for her murder, I think up to three people.  He had asked to kill this woman. 
[02:20:30]  You don't then have her die and not get these people start yapping.  I don't think he cares.  I think he didn't want...  You think he, Sandy, you think his life was so pathetic and miserable that he...  Yeah, he didn't want her to be the mother of his daughter.  He just didn't want her to be the mother of Rose.  Get those away from me, Rick.  And, like, now, he's a very good father, and he has a very nice daughter,  and now the daughter is mothering...  Right, right, right.  All right, all right.  What?  I understand.  The daughter is the mother of Robert.  All right, we're running out of show here. 
[02:21:00]  So, Sandy Cain brought in a Robert Blake song.  Okay.  Right?  Robert Blake, yes.  Scott, really, really quick on line nine.  Scott says, Ant's story is as smooth as Jason Williams.  There you go.  He was getting in the car, and he was...  No, because the intention was to cover up the Jason Williams thing  and make it look like an accident.  You've got to make it look like that right from the start.  But it would have went through the head and cut out the wrist  and shatter Connelly's wrist bone. 
[02:21:30]  It's never going to work.  In pristine condition.  He was a Marine.  All right.  It's a repository building.  All right, go ahead.  Yes, Andy Cain.  Yes.  All I know, it has revived Robert Blake's career.  Beretta is...  What are you saying?  No, it's Beretta.  He's all over.  Yeah.  Really?  And if he gets on, he'll be, you know...  You think maybe we might start seeing it on Nick at Night or TV Land?  I'm not even telling you.  No, it is.  Beretta's back on the air.  Oh, it is, is it?  Boy, I hope Gary Coleman's listening today.  Yeah, shoot somebody, Gary. 
[02:22:00]  Jesus.  I'm telling you.  He's going to revive the career.  Sandy, so you brought in a song.  We got the karaoke.  You're going to sing to it live.  And then you brought us marshmallows.  Why marshmallows today?  Because they're not as...  Like, you usually throw knives and scissors and...  Stamplers.  ...and I get a little scared, you know.  Yeah.  I'm ugly enough to...  I don't want to, like, be worse.  All right, so you gave us marshmallows to throw at you.  Yes.  Okay.  I was going to get, like, the chocolate covered, but...  Right.  Should I have...  No, that's fine.  Let's see. 
[02:22:30]  I want to hear this.  The Lallow Mars.  We're ready for the song, Sandy?  Okay.  I mean, Kid Rock was on and...  Oh, my God, we're running out of time.  We sang, stupid.  What about...  Put your headphones on.  Anthony, could you, like, give me some harmony on this?  No.  No.  I only sing with Kid Rock.  That's right.  Okay.  Why aren't you with Kid Rock?  I was wondering.  I only sing with...  Oh, will you shut up?  Here we go.  I just wrote this, by the way.  So, yeah, I'm just...  Her wig is a mullet.  It's awful.  She got a Joe Dirt wig on. 
[02:23:00]  Can I do the jobless?  Oh, no.  Oh, stop it.  A little bit.  Come on.  God, we got the perfect breasts over here.  They're Jewish, but they're hams.  They're Jewish, but they're hams.  You got a 10 and a 1 in the studio.  I'm going to do double Ds.  Oh, wow.  Look at that.  Divine, delightful, delicious, and dangerous.  Look at that.  Look at it.  It's disgusting.  Dangerous.  She did point to her ass when she said dangerous. 
[02:23:30]  We'll all agree with that.  I don't want to come out.  No, we don't want to see that tonight.  No, keep that hidden.  We're going to start the song, all right?  Sandy, you ready?  My inverted.  Are you ready?  Okay.  Can you say nipples?  Yes.  No.  Actually, Sandy, Sandy, do not say...  No, look, look, look, look.  Shut up.  Don't even say it again.  Don't say, I can say that, or I can't...  Don't even mention it now.  You're done with saying that.  Sing your song.  We'll start the music.  What can't you say?  Don't say it.  I'll throw this brick at you. 
[02:24:00]  You ready, Sandy?  Yes, I am.  All right.  That's Sandy Cain's Robert Blake song, Anthony.  Here is the music.  A little low.  Can you make it a little louder?  Turn her headphones up and start it over again.  Is that the Eric Clapton version where the kid falls out the window?  Oh.  Sandy, the headphones work better when they're on your ears and not your cheeks.  Yeah, where are you...  I'm going to my grasp and say... 
[02:24:30]  All right.  All right.  You ready?  Okay, girls.  You ready?  Good lungs, though, huh?  Yeah, listen.  Listen for the drum click.  Robert Blake shot Bonnie Beckley.  Yeah, he shot her in the head.  Robert Blake shot Bonnie Beckley.  He used to be...  Cause he wished that she was dead.  Yeah, he put the gun to Bonnie's head. 
[02:25:00]  And he shot poor Bonnie Lee Beckley's head.  He said, Bonnie, you're a douchebag and a scumbag, too.  And I think I'm going to shoot you in the hemorrhoid, too.  He aimed his gun, he fired, and now she's dead.  Shut up!  Shut up!  She shot him in the head.  Quiet. 
[02:25:30]  You know what?  Shut up.  You know what?  Huh?  Robert Blake shot Bonnie Beckley.  Shut up!  Yeah, he shot.  Ooh, ooh.  Oh, ooh.  Oh, ooh.  Bonnie, oh, man.  Quiet.  Robert Blake is dead.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Yeah, he shot her in the hemorrhoid.  Shut up!  Shut up!  Yeah, Robert put the guns on Bonnie's head.  And he said, you know, you're a poor and a scumbag. 
[02:26:00]  Shut up, Demi.  Uh-oh.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up, Demi.  He shot her in the head.  And he's lying.  Oh, he's both throwing a flame in the hemorrhoid.  And then he shot her in the hemorrhoid, too.  Bobby, I think you did the right thing, because she was terrible.  She, like, ripped people off and stuff.  Hey, light one up real good.  Get one of those bubble and throw it like napalm.  O.J. did it, and he got away when it took.  Oh, he'll be lighting up.  Bobby, let it get really, let it get really flaming, O.P.  Yeah, shot her in the head. 
[02:26:30]  Ooh, ooh, ooh.  I'm trying to throw it out of her head.  Throw it out of her head.  I'm trying to throw it out of her head.  And he shot her in the hemorrhoid.  I wish she would explode.  I wish she'd make the music loud.  I can't hear it.  It's loud enough.  I'll burn those marshmallows.  Shut up, Demi.  All right.  Shut up, Demi.  Uh-oh, yeah.  Shut up, Demi.  He shot her in the hemorrhoid.  Shut up, Demi.  Shut up.  Stop.  Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.  And then she said, 
[02:27:00]  Bobby, make your Beretta.  Quiet.  And now, Barney Lee is there.  Quiet.  Shut up, Demi.  Quiet.  How could you do that, man?  Quiet.  I can see why, though.  Could you shut up?  Could you shut up?  Could you shut up?  No, I can't.  Shut up.  I say, pay attention.  Shut up, Demi.  Folks, you know what?  Shut up, Demi.  Oh.  Trying to play.  Shot by me.  Oh, no.  She took one in the face.  Yeah, shot her in the head.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[02:27:30]  Hang the phone up, dookie skank.  You are very ignorant.  You are even more stupid than I first computed.  King coming in from the O&A show.  I hope I survive.  I hope I survive better than Bonnie Lee did.  Robert Blake, where are you?  I think I'm...  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Okay, terrific.  Hey, what do you think, Gloria Ann? 
[02:28:00]  I'm speechless.  Yes, you are, aren't you?  Don't ever get ugly, Gloria Ann.  Oh, God.  You all right?  No, I loved it.  She's a mess.  We threw burning marshmallows at her.  I laid my chest.  That was really good.  Well, you told me to throw the marshmallows, so I threw the whole bag.  I threw the whole bag.  Shut up!  And her hair is...  Her mullet wig is dressed.  Her mullet wig. 
[02:28:30]  What made you pick the mullet wig today?  If you think too much time on my hands on that wig, that is horrible.  It's not a wig.  You leave me in my hair?  Shut up, stupid.  Let them finish laughing.  That's all right.  Her mascara is running.  Very nice.  All right.  It's the great Sandy Kane.  Yes, yes, Sandy Kane.  It's wonderful.  Could you wipe me before I leave?  We're going to take a very quick break here to try to catch up a little bit, and we'll continue.  So stay there.  You guys have the exterior ladies.  It's the unbelief right now. 
[02:29:00]  It's the O.B. and Anthony Show.  Thank you.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  1027 WNEW.  Hey, we had fun today.  Hi, Ann.  Oh, yeah.  I want to thank Gloria Ann for stopping by today.  She's been topless for four straight hours.  Oh, my God.  If this show needs anything, it's more boobs.  And, you know, we broke out a new bit today.  The boob board.  You know, there are actually a lot of good-looking police officers out there. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, look at the men in blue getting a little compliment.  Cool.  Well, Gloria Ann was topless in Times Square.  We got video.  It'll be up on foundrymusic.com later on tonight.  We got video of Gloria Ann in the studio.  Gloria Ann going to the bathroom.  No.  I mean, we have so much footage of Gloria Ann, it's ridiculous.  The hidden camera.  Rick did a photo shoot.  That'll be up on foundrymusic.com later on tonight.  Yeah.  Also, we got Sandy Cain singing.  That will be up on foundrymusic.com. 
[02:30:00]  And hopefully no pictures of Sandy Cain.  Isn't that funny?  You know, because Gloria Ann just comes down to just come down and say hi.  Right.  Immediately, she's stripped nude and walked around the city,  and a thousand pictures of her taken.  There must have been at least a thousand pictures taken.  Well, I have to thank the New York men because it was really cold out there,  but being surrounded by all the guys kind of, like, gave me body food.  Yeah, I bet.  Right.  Yeah, very nice.  I feel cozy.  Hey, and good luck with that movie, the, uh, what is it again? 
[02:30:30]  The Curse of the Komodo.  The Curse of the Komodo.  Yeah.  There you go.  The Curse of the Komodo, Anthony.  She plays a scientist or something.  Yes, I do.  An environmental scientist.  Not too much of a stretch.  Science.  She blinded me with science.  She took science once.  That's good enough.  How'd you do in science in school?  Actually, I scored in the 99th top percentile.  Really? 
[02:31:00]  Yes, I did.  In Kansas, though, right?  Yes, in Kansas.  Yeah, Kansas is a different story.  I think it sounded good until you got a shot part of it.  The earth is in the center, and everything spins around her.  Yeah, they had that Curse thing in Kansas.  Yeah.  Yeah.  A C becomes an A, you know.  Grated on a curve.  But, see, obviously, you can tell that Kansas isn't totally flat.  No.  No.  There's something in the well water, too. 
[02:31:30]  I reckon.  She can say anything.  She won't listen all day long.  She'll listen and laugh like retards.  Sandy King could come in here and solve cancer.  Sure cancer.  And we would be like, shut up.  You got to take this.  Just shut up.  And put it in a chemical and put it in.  Right.  What?  Shut up.  We don't care.  We're trying to light a lot of fire.  We did.  You really did.  Flaming marshmallows today.  You know what?  We got to be careful with the flaming marshmallows.  Yeah, because you could have caught her whole wig on fire.  No, it won't explain.  We got to turn on the halon system. 
[02:32:00]  Yeah.  Which will suck the oxygen right out of this room.  Well, it doesn't suck it out.  It replaces it with a gas that does not allow things to burn in.  Yeah.  Which also does not allow humans to breathe.  That's right.  Didn't you ever remember the girl that got killed?  She was trapped in some room at work.  And instead of just picking up the phone and calling the fire department, it was like  a little airtight room.  And she pulled the fire alarm, which sucked all the air out.  Ah, there you go.  Killed it.  Cute story.  Yeah.  Sorry, I told you that.  You just depressed Gloria.  No, it just reminded me of it because you said they're sucking the air out. 
[02:32:30]  All right.  Joe, what's up?  Yeah, dude.  What's up with the cancer that she was supposed to get, man?  I mean, remember when you did, you know, what the hell is that?  Yeah, I know.  Sandy Cain.  She had twato, which is some kind of a wart.  It's, uh, yeah, it's a, you know what it is.  It's a wart.  It's the herb.  That dude said he was supposed to cause cancer or something.  Joe, I am so glad you decided to say something completely different than what's on the screen. 
[02:33:00]  Thank you.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I just want to tell you what I learned today.  Yeah, let's go.  I learned, according to Anthony, if you pay the bitch, she better lick the yam bag.  Right.  If you're paying for it.  Have a good night, guys.  Bye.  Bye.  Very good.  Let's, uh, yeah, we'll play what do we learn.  What the hell?  Mike, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Today I learned that, uh, Keith's a cop is a cheap date.  Yeah.  Boy, he's giving out oral favors for how, what was his price? 
[02:33:30]  25.  25.  25 bucks.  I was nervous, and he wanted 35 to receive it.  To receive it, right?  I didn't get much.  Yeah.  But then he was willing to accept 15.  I learned, uh, Keith has low self-esteem.  Thank you, man.  Oh, sorry about that.  Hey, Big Mike, what did you learn on the show today?  Oh, man, what's happening, man?  Hey.  Uh, I learned that, uh, the O.B. and Anthony show and Keith the Cop are both number one  between men, 18 and 54.  And that, and that he's off tomorrow, but he's going to be working. 
[02:34:00]  Later.  Hey, that's even better.  Very good.  The poor guy, you know, he's just trying to share today, Ed.  I know, he's trying to share.  He had some undercover detail a while back where he had to pose as a male prostitute.  It wasn't his choice that he decided to say 25 bucks for oral.  Anthony, what's up?  What's up, guys?  I learned today that Kansas is now spelled with C-A-N.  Not K-A-N.  Yes.  Hans ass.  Hans.  Beautiful, what's his kid?  Yeah, thanks to Gloria Ann, we're, uh, changing the spelling of Kansas. 
[02:34:30]  Oh, wait, wait, wait.  Why is, uh, Rick taking Gloria Ann out of the studio again?  Yeah, Rick, what are you doing, Rick?  I just got a new clip, an empty clip.  He's taking more pictures.  I don't blame him, all right.  I'm going to take some more shots.  Rick, Rick.  You're smart.  Get the pants.  Yes.  Even if it's a panty shot.  You're a panty.  Panty shot.  I don't care.  Hurry.  Eh, bravo.  Drop something.  The cars are being dropped left and right today.  What happened, Ben?  Did that big delicious C bump into them? 
[02:35:00]  Jesus.  Those monstrous Down Syndrome balls in the front there?  Actually, he was moving the cars with them.  It's prehensile, you know.  It's like the...  Drop the remote, right?  Hey, uh...  Hey, I learned O&A are number one with uncut young bucks, age 12 to 100 in Philly.  Nick, what's going on?  Very good.  Hey, I learned, uh, that you can have beauty and the beast on one show.  Yes.  Wow, yeah.  Hey, Norton.  It's not going to work. 
[02:35:30]  Oh, boy, dude, that was a lame attempt.  Very lame.  Too good.  I'm too cute.  Jersey Gary, I learned today, Sandy Cade or Gloriette.  It's all in the DNA mixing.  Eric, uh, learned that the producer of The Curse of the Komodo Dragon is Hugh Janus.  Huge?  His name is Hugh.  Hugh.  And his last name is Janus.  Yep.  Hugh Janus.  Hugh Janus.  Sheep Lover learned the stinky cam needs to be changed to the awesome cam.  The awesome cam.  Yeah, change that immediately.  That's...  That's...  We should do that.  Change it immediately. 
[02:36:00]  Tell, uh, Scotty there.  Good.  Uh, YV from Queens.  I learned that prostitutes are actual people and not pieces of meat.  Who knew?  Sheep Lover also learned, uh, don't F with Anthony's t-shirt throwing skills.  Today, uh, Josh learned, uh, that Robert Blake shot Bonnie Blakely in the head.  Hoo-hoo.  Then shot her in the hemorrhoid.  Oh, yeah.  It's the same thing.  It's amazing to see a woman so completely devoid of any sexual, uh, integrity or any talent. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Nothing.  There's nothing...  Yes.  ...sexy.  Right.  Nothing.  What do you mean?  I...  Gloria Ann is real sexy with, uh...  Come on.  With her...  She's just...  Gloria Ann has got to have some awful thing with her because she's too perfect.  Awesome, Garrett.  Awesome, Garrett.  How's Rick working?  Is he getting the pants off?  Tell us.  Pants.  Her, uh, her pants are down past her...  Past her butt when she's got the underwear on.  Very...  She has a leopard skin thong.  Very nice.  She's got to get the pants off.
