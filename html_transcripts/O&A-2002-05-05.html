<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, punctuated by numerous commercials for various products and services, including the Inn of the Dove, Vermont Teddy Bear Company, Sun World Airlines, Connecticut Schools of Broadcasting, Mercedes-Benz, Bridgestone tires, Ameritrain, Advance Auto Parts, Stacker 2, Rentway, Sam Ash, Trim Spa, Hotwire, Foreman Mills, Cotman Transmission, and the Market Pro Computer Show, as well as numerous television programs like *Gilmore Girls*, *Smallville*, *Survivor*, *CSI*, *Judging Amy*, *Inside Edition*, *24*, *That '70s Show*, *Everybody Loves Raymond*, *Buffy the Vampire Slayer*, and *Roswell*.  The show also heavily promoted their upcoming live shows in Philadelphia and Washington D.C., including a contest to win a meet-and-greet with Kid Rock.

Early in the broadcast, a 12-year-old caller, "Sandbox" (Zach), claimed to be a Jupiterian alien in his third human life, detailing a war between Jupiterians and sun people, a trip to Heaven where he saw God as a hippie, and his Earth conception. He described superpowers, including petrification with his spit, and gave instructions—including the password "Al Dukes is a fag"—to find interdimensional pods in NYC subway stations.

A significant portion of the show focused on the upcoming "Money Snatch" contest, featuring naked women collecting dollar bills.  Several potential contestants were interviewed, including Maura and Jewel (a former stripper), Nicole, Amber, and Casey. The hosts engaged in sexually suggestive questioning, revealing that many potential participants were withdrawing.  The exact nature of the contest's "twist" remained unclear.

Cowbell Bill was a guest in the studio.  The hosts discussed the arrest of a pipe bomber whose band's music was played on air, and recounted a car chase they witnessed.  They also had an incomplete call with Steve-O from *Jackass*, who was apparently unavailable due to a drug-related emergency.  Recurring character "Stalker Patty" was discussed extensively; listeners Joyce and Tim called in regarding her eviction and the show's coverage. The hosts also played audio clips of people with intellectual disabilities engaged in sexually explicit situations.

Later in the show, Jay Moore appeared in studio, promoting his website jaymorelive.com.  An unexplained uncomfortable moment ensued, followed by discussions of his sperm count and a masturbation story.  Suge Knight and Dave Navarro were promoted as future guests.  Sadie Allison (sexpert, author of "Tickle Your Fancy") and Alex Carroll (author of "Speeding Excuses That Work") were both guests, engaging in sexually explicit conversations about female anatomy and sexual practices, and providing and debating advice on avoiding traffic tickets, respectively.  Numerous callers shared their experiences with sex and traffic tickets.  The hosts also played audio from an old sex education video for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

Paul Mercurio joined the show, detailing and providing audio of a prank he pulled during a performance of *The Graduate*, yelling “Kathleen, put your goddamn clothes back on” at a nude Kathleen Turner.  The show also featured a lengthy technical issue with the microphone.  Sandy from New Hampshire was interviewed as a potential "Money Snatch" contestant.  The hosts discussed shaving Patty's head again at their celebrity softball game,  and a call from a listener three hours late ("Stu" from Seattle) was taken.  Finally, the show concluded with further promotion of the "Money Snatch Game" and their upcoming road trip.

[00:07:00]  But I need to tell you about tactical plans  Of how to survive this Earth blast  Now why is the Earth  This is tactical  Why is the Earth  I'll start off with why I know all this  Hey Sandbox  Well actually my real name is Zach  Why is the Earth gonna blow up?  The sun is going to cause a chain reaction  Of a sun explosion  And it was going to attack the Earth  12 is such an interesting age Ovi  It's that age where you can either really be starting to get mature  You know what I mean? 
[00:07:30]  Yeah  Like it's the 12 year old that might sit with the family  And discuss even politics or things like that  Politics sucks  And then there's kids 12 years old like Sandbox here  Who is talking about  My name is Zach  Who is talking about the Earth exploding because of some chain reaction  Okay explain what's gonna happen Zach  Okay well actually I'm an alien called the Jupiterian  You're an alien  Yes I am  What video game do you play Sandbox?  GTA 3  State of Emergency  That's a good one  I like hitting old ladies with bats 
[00:08:00]  That's a lot of fun on the game  Alright so what's your theory?  The sun's gonna explode and attack the Earth?  Yes  What's it called?  Well actually the Jupiterians and the sun people have been at war for many centuries to come  And well I'm in my third life right now  You're in your third life?

Alright  Alright this is the way  And how do you figure out that you're one of these sun people?  Or a Jupiterian  Well Jupiterians are very peaceful aliens  Aren't they called Jovian?  What?  People like beings from Jupiter are called Jovians  Not Jupiterians  How much do you wanna bet? 
[00:09:00]  I bet you any amount of money dude  Well how did he figure out he was a Jupiterian?  Oh I'll bet you stalker Patty's leftover hair  Alright but how did you figure out you were a Jupiterian?  I've known this ever since I came to Earth  Of course when he came to Earth he knew it already  Because he had been from Jupiter  Alright so how did you get here?  Well actually my parents  When I'm in my second life  We were still being on the war against the sun people  And well  Now how do people live on the sun? 
[00:09:30]  It's very hot  Yeah well there's sun people  And they're able to live in that habitat  That's all the explanation I need  Sure  Okay so now you  Why did you come to Earth from Jupiter?  Because what's it called  My parents didn't think it was a good place for me  Starting off my second life as a child  You know they sent me to Heaven  I saw God  He actually looks more like a hippie than a savior  And what's it called  He sent me to Earth  He sent me to my dad's unit  Junk  You know whatever you want to call it  And then I came  That's how I was made  So your parents are definitely Jupiterians too

Yeah they kind of look like little pods  And it can hold up to millions of people at a time 
[00:13:00]  And that will transport us at light speed from earth to Jupiter  Alright  But don't you worry because Jupiter has plenty of air, food and water  Now everything we've sent to Jupiter shows that the atmosphere is not conducive to human beings living there  I don't know what that means I'm sorry  Alright I just want to know where the pod is  Where's the pod?  We ain't got no pod  No pods that we go to  My parents  Yeah my whole family is against marijuana  Right right  No Zach how do we find the transportation pod? 
[00:13:30]  Well I can tell you directions to one in New York City and one in Valley Cottage  Alright where is it?  Valley Cottage by Nyack New York  Alright where's the New York City one?

Okay listen very carefully  Okay  Al Dukes is a fag  Al Dukes is a fag is the password?  Yep and then it'll open and it'll say welcome Tumbana  Then you follow me and it'll be like follow me as you can I'm the gingerbread man 
[00:14:30]  Alright and we follow you down to the pod  Yeah  Yep and then you'll get to Jupiter it's really cool  Is there hot chicks on Jupiter for all of us?  Actually yeah  Yeah  Alright well thanks  They don't have a year  Hey thank you Harry Potter we got to move on with our show  Wait I have one more thing to say  Yes  Uh oh very important  Sandbox  Sandbox is very important  Now you must listen  I'm listening  Al Dukes is a fag  Alright thank you  I hate him  Alright thank you Sandbox  Bye  Bye  Coincidentally he's the same kid that kicked me out of the Cats and Hats guild 
[00:15:00]  Right  On EverQuest  Very upset  With Sandbox or Zack whatever his name is  Wow  Kid's pretty witty for 12 though  God damn kid  Is that witty or is that mental illness?  What did we just hear?  I think it's a little wit  I know at 12 I went through a phase where I was a complete science geek  I would go to school 
[00:15:30]  I would uh  I was very into astronomy  And the planets and everything  You probably had a microscope  I had microscopes, chemistry sets  I was the geekiest kid  Bill  I see Bill laughing  He would come over to my house  Cowbell Bill's here today  Bill would come over to the house to hang out with my brother  And smoke pot and do cool stuff  And they would just rag on me  Relentlessly  My brother like  I'd be all psyched because  That night something happened  And I'd bring my telescope out 
[00:16:00]  And he'd just be like  Bring your telescope out you faggot  Faggot  He'd tell me how embarrassed he was  Because I was such a geek nerd  You know  And uh  I was so into that  But then  It was about 12 years old or so  Maybe even 11, 12  I kind of started getting interested in girls  You know what I mean?  And that eps up everything  And that  Everything else went out the wind  All of a sudden  I didn't want to make believe  I was Godzilla 
[00:16:30]  Walking around  I'm crushing things  You know?  Things like that  So it seems like  Lil Zack is still in the phase  Where he believes he's an alien from Jupiter  His story is very well thought out though  He's a Jupiterian  Like because  A kid says he's from Jupiter, right?  What do you do?  You say  Alright, how'd you get here?  Well maybe he is from Jupiter  No spaceship, nothing  The guy went to God  Who then put him in his father's seed  And made him conceive  As a child here on Earth 
[00:17:00]  And now he has Earth parents  Right  He's got Earth parents  But he's still from Jupiter  Here we're laughing and mocking him  What if he's  What if he's absolutely right  And he was telling us everything  And the subway stations have the goddamn pod  And he told us  He told us the password  I don't even remember it now  And all of a sudden the sun explodes  And the Earth gets destroyed  And look at us now  I don't remember that secret word  He went  I don't know what that was  I just completely forgot everything you said already  Alright, we gotta move on in 
[00:17:30]  Because we got so much to do  Let's go right to Maura  What's up, Maura?  Hello  What's up, Maura?  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good  Why are you calling on?

[01:09:30]  Yeah  And we ran out of time  We had to run out of here  Right at 7 yesterday  And we don't really know what happened to Patty  Yeah  She didn't want to go back to the house  We were arguing with the sister  Or the daughter of her landlord  For  Well Patty tried to call  About a half hour  Patty called the house a bunch of times  She was like  Patty who?

[01:10:00]  How you doing?  Good  You got the stalker Patty update?  Yeah well after last night's tobacco  With that horrible woman  I didn't want her to go back to that house either  And I kind of got scared  So I called Stinky  And I said  Stinky we got to do something  So I volunteered to take her back there  Get some clothes  Wait  Stinky was involved?  Well Stinky took the call  Well what do you want to do about it?  I don't care  I need to smoke pot  We could go get her high  I don't care  Hi Joyce  This is Garrett  Stinky  Awesome 
[01:10:30]  I'm awesome  Yes he is  And why do I care?  We will find Patty  An awesome place to live  Well at first he shrugged me off  He said  Oh come on  She's going to be fine  She'll be fine  I was really concerned  So I volunteered to take her home  Get some things  I didn't want her to go to that crazy woman's house by herself  And bring her back to the studio to stay overnight  Then I thought about it  And I said  You know what?  I'm not letting her stay in that studio  So when I got there  She was on with Ron and Fez  And then when she came out  When they went to break  I said  Patty listen 
[01:11:00]  I have a surprise for you  You're not going to stay in the studio tonight  I got you two nights at a hotel  Right up the street here  Oh you did did you?  Yeah  Two nights  Two nights  Last night and tonight she'll be there  And I just couldn't leave her there  You know  The decent thing to do  Is to help out her  And the show  And to just try to bring some  Calmness to the situation  Hey no room service at this hotel  Is there?  No  Oh no  No mini bar right?  No  I got him  Good  And that's the last we've heard 
[01:11:30]  No actually I spoke to her this afternoon  She called to tell me that she did go back there  And that she was going to be meeting with you guys later on  To give you the whole thing of what went down over there  When she did get there  Oh she went back  She went back this morning  Good  She went back to Staten Island this morning  Well we'll hear from Patty a little later on  She's supposed to come in to get her head shaved for $806  That's right  She is  Alright  Well Joyce  Thank you so much  Hey  Anything to you guys for her  You know I felt bad  It was the right thing to do  And I stepped in

Well no actually  I heard about the contest last week  And I called in and actually emailed Rick  And that's how he just called me today  So I called you guys back  Alright  It's turning out we got a lot of prudes that listen to the O&A 
[01:13:00]  Yeah  A lot of girls backing out  Yeah I don't understand this  Every girl seems to recognize the fact that they're going to be completely naked  Right?  You know that  Yeah  You're fine with that?  Yeah I don't really have a problem  I mean it's just other girls and you guys  Right  Whatever I don't really care  Well it'll just  It'll be Anthony and I  Because we got a  You know we got a comment on what's going on  And that's why some of my questioning Opie is best left turned down  I try to  I try to see just how prudish some of the girls are 
[01:13:30]  That's all I'm trying to do  Yeah  That's all  So there are certain questions that are asked  It just sees the mindset  That's all  So Nicole you know the whole deal  You come in tomorrow  A bunch of other naked girls  You're running around for about five minutes  Trying to collect as much money as possible  That will be thrown all over the studio  And hanging from the ceiling and stuff  Right?  Mm-hmm  Okay  And there's another twist  And Ann's going to explain that twist  Yeah  And if you're okay with this twist  We will add you to the list of names that will be joining us tomorrow 
[01:14:00]  Okay  I gotta tell you man  A lot of prudes out there  I know  When we do stuff for girls it's a nightmare  Because they always back out  I know  If we need ten guys for some crazy contest  We get twenty  We get twenty and they all show up  We have to overbook just  They bring their friends too  So we get forty  We get forty or fifty guys  It's hard to do that math  We have to get like thirty girls  And to get five basically  Right  Because they all back out  So don't back out Nicole  I'll try not to  And if you have an inkling of backing out  You gotta tell us 
[01:14:30]  So we can keep the spot open for somebody else  And this goes for all the girls that are waiting on hold  That's right  Alright here we go  So Ann will explain the other twist  Of the O&A Money Snatch game  Okay  Mmhmm  Yes  You sound very scary  Well I'm covering  I'm covering the mic with my hands  So that it doesn't bleed through to the other mics  I have to talk very low  You're using your  Hello Sydney  Because everybody else can hear you right

[01:42:00]  Speedball  Wow, another one, huh?  Just like Belushi and River Phoenix  Another one goes to the speedball  Speedball  Irwin and cocaine mixture  I don't get that  The up-down thing  And they figured that he died on April 5th, Anthony  And when did they find him?  Two weeks later  Coincidentally, April 5th was the same day  Kurt Cobain died  Wow  So that's the official report 
[01:42:30]  There you go  Wayne Staley died of a speedball overdose  How will this affect the music of Apathy?  And I noticed Tim Sabian is playing foosball  During the breaks, Anthony  Yeah  Is he good?  You know something, Tim?  Not bad  Not a bad player  I smoked him  Made him look silly  He stinks  He wasn't going much for the push shot 
[01:43:00]  I was playing front  He's playing back  So I'd line up the shot  I'd do a little push  And then slam that thing  Bam!  And he was pretty good at blocking that  So once I saw that he could block that  But then he wasn't able to block anything  I'd do a pin shot  Where I pin the ball  And pull  And then slam it  They had lightning fast  He couldn't even see it  He had no clue  He felt stupid  He felt stupid  You know when the ball actually says hello  Down the other goal?  Yeah  Where you slam it in so hard  It goes, hey  Hey, hi 
[01:43:30]  Like down at the other goal  Ah, it's like that  Very ugly  I defy anybody to beat me  And where is Tim?  He left  He left a broken man  He actually said  He was talking about me playing front  Him playing goal  And he said we can make a lot of money  So he's thinking  I guess me and him are going to go out the far  Is he that good?  And make some money  He's pretty good  Yeah  He's pretty good  He's in town because  Hard for me to judge though  Because I'm so good  Here comes Tim Saban 
[01:44:00]  I'm so good  That it's hard to judge  Very good  But I can play backs  You can play fronts  And we can take on the world  I'm a little nervous  Somebody of my caliber plays against us  And you know what happens  He's going to be shooting past you  Because it was pretty easy for me  But you guys are taking on Alex  I pretty much figured out  No, we had two people that never played before  Well, that's true  So I would have played backs  You play fronts  Yeah  You take on the world  All right  I'd be willing to do that  Tim's in town  The whole company's in town this week  Everyone's in New York  For the big infinity meetings that go on  I don't know what happens  I think they put the hoods on

Of course you were speeding  I understand  Only works for  For girls  If you're a guy  And you're doing that  When a cop comes up  To the window  Did I say cop  Comes up to the window?  Actually  Actually it might work  I think a cop  Came up to the window  And you were doing that  And he might be so scared  He might say  I'm out of here  Yeah, I don't think so  I think there'd be  A lot more cops on the way  Let me ask Alex  And Sadie questions  Here, Anthony  Alex, why should we  Buy your book?  Why should you buy my book? 
[01:53:30]  Well, the story  Behind this book  Is you guys know  The story  Beat the cops  Was a book  On how to get out  Of your ticket  What we did with this one  Was we had a contest  On the website  And Sadie  Your book  I'm teasing of course  No, we had a contest  On the website  And gave away a free copy  Of Beat the Cops  Every week  To the person  Who submitted  The best ticket story  They've got something  In common here  Anthony  Alex's book  Is Beat the Cops  And Sadie's book  Is Beat the  So it's a collection

[02:07:00]  I have a court date  For aggravated  Unlicensed operations  The cop caught me  When I was driving  Without the license  Right  What should I do  Well in this particular  Situation what you want  To do is  You want to  I would go in  And explain to the judge  That you were  You needed to travel  Back and forth to work  And or to school  And you can normally  Get a provisional license  Once you lose your license  To go back and forth  To work and school  And just say that  You weren't aware of it  And you just found out  About it  And you need to get  That taken care of  And that's probably  So you're basically 
[02:07:30]  Hoping the judge  Has a heart  Yeah well  I mean in this  Particular case though  I mean when  When somebody screws up  They give them  A provisional license  So they can still  Get to work  And you can just say  You didn't know about that  You just found out  About it  And you need to get  That taken care of  And you know  I actually do have  To go to school though  And what are the  Possible repercussions of this  Am I going to jail  Or something  If they decide  No you're not going to jail  Just be cool  Alright thanks a lot  I'll take them  To the Black Mountain Marauders  Alright  Thank you  If you do go to jail  You might want to  Tickle your fancy  Is there a chapter in here

[02:13:30]  That's pretty good  It's pretty gross  But it's pretty good  He once taught us too  I think you could like  Pour water on your crotch  Yeah  There's a guy  Take some Hershey's syrup  And squirt it all over  The windshield  No there's a guy  That carries a bottle  Of water with him  Everywhere he goes  And every time  He gets stopped  He just dumps it  In his lap  And he tells the cop  He's got bladder problems  Pretty degrading  But he saves himself  Some money  He's gotten out  Of three tickets  Bladder problems  So be it  I wet myself  We're going to take a break  We'll get the demonstration  Going next  Also Anthony  No one's going to believe me

[02:27:00]  All traffic tickets  Yeah  We have a detective saying that you're full of S  Yeah  I'm sure you've heard this before  I hear it all the time  John, New York detective  What's going on?  Hey guys, how's it going, man?  All right  Listen, number one  If a police officer doesn't show up in court once  The case gets rescheduled  We make arrests  We get caught  We have vacations  So when he says that, he's wrong  Second, telling that guy who was arrested for aggravated unlicensed operator  If he goes into the judge and says, oh, I was on my way to school  I was on my way to work 
[02:27:30]  He's going to get found guilty  And he's going to be fined  Because when his license was suspended  He was given a form to fill out that he should have mailed in  And it would have given him a restricted use license  This guy's giving general information that the average cop  As long as he establishes a prime official case in court  He's going to win  And this guy's trying to sell his book and make money with people  And they're going to waste their time  Are you a judge?  Am I a judge?  Are you a judge?  No, but I'm a police officer  So it's 16 years  You're not the one making the decisions up there, dude  And you're not a police officer 
[02:28:00]  That ever wrote a song that had to go to traffic court  So what do you know?  You're not a judge  That's right  You're not making the decisions  But I have the experience  You don't want to hear it  It's because you want to make money off the people  You're wrong  You're wrong  You just want to make money off the people  You're not a judge  If he goes in there and explains to the judge  Your Honor  I didn't realize that I had a provisional license available to him  It's up to the judge  It's not up to you  And you don't know what the hell you're talking about  And the judge will say when his license was suspended  He was given a form to fill out  You're not the judge  And you're not the one going to be making the decision 
[02:28:30]  And I have the experience making the rest  Hold on  You just whip people off  You just whip people off  You make your money off people's agony  That's it  You're wrong  Show me some people that won with some of these  All right  Show up once in court  The cop ain't there  You lose  Yeah well  You're certainly not going to share your opinions pal  Yeah  And my opinion is  You're both whipping people off  You're screwing people  I've got some of this  And you've got no proof that this works  Whatever  Yeah whatever  I actually want to say that  Because you want people to 
[02:29:00]  You're not the judge  Okay  You're not the one making the decision  16 years of experience  You have zero law enforcement  Zero  You don't know what you're talking about  I've been in court  I've testified  And I've won  With people that use your excuses  And that's going to work  Show me people that have won  Nobody  You've got nobody  You've got excuses that don't win  I got a whole effing book full of them  Dude  Yeah a whole effing book  Yeah  You know Alex  Tell you what  Coming to New York City  I'll write you a ticket  And you try and beat it 
[02:29:30]  With your jerk off excuses  Because you'll lose  Yeah whatever  You have zero law enforcement  Wow  All right John  Zero law enforcement  Good job John  And I said cut me off  You want me to sell them  You want to sell them  Cut me off  John we gave you a fair enough chance  We're just going to move on with the show  That's all  Oh okay  You guys have a good day  Over there you rock man  You did great  John the detective there  All right  Thank you  All right  Wow  Well you get that all the time  We had to put them through  Cops get very pissed off 
[02:30:00]  When they hear you on the radio  You know it's funny  Because I get some cops  That come up and call up  And react like that  And then I get lots of cops  I had a cop call up  On a show I was doing the other day  And he called up  And he goes  He's like I'm so glad  You're doing what you're doing  And he says  You know most of us cops out there  We just get really  You know PO'd  That they're just using us  As revenue generators  You know tax collectors  With badges  And you know most of us  Just get really irritated about it  And we're glad  You know you're helping people out  I got a buddy on my  You know local force  Who says you know Alex  He says one of these days  We're going to have to go  Go do a ride along together 
[02:30:30]  And I'll go up to the driver's side  Write the ticket  You go up to the passenger's side  Sell the book  And we'll split the profits  So hey  Whatever  You know if you want to get  All bent out of shape  And take him personally  It ain't my problem  I'm just trying to help  The people out there  Who got tickets  That they don't deserve  You know  That was taken a little personally  Yeah he seriously  Is having a problem  All right  Glenn what's going on  Hey how you doing guys  Good  I got a ticket  While I was on the  Northern State Parkway  I was on my cell phone  How do I get out of that  That was after the law  Was passed huh  It was Saturday night  Yeah  Well I don't know 
[02:31:00]  I mean you might want to  Just go into the judge  And say your honor  I didn't realize  That the law  Had recently been passed  I'm sorry  I won't do it again  Bring the receipt in  And show him that you got  The wireless thing  Installed in the car  And see if he'll give you a break  Might be worth a shot  Yeah I'm actually doing it now  I'm just trying to  Yeah bring the receipt in with you  That'll like show him  That you really do  You know you really  You really were mistaken  And you got it taken care of  And you got you know  The best of intentions  And it might work  Thanks a lot guys  All right Glenn  Thank you  I think that seems so 
[02:31:30]  Hard to enforce  And you just say  It's a tough one  I wasn't  I wasn't talking on  And then they say you were  No  Yeah you don't want to do that  I was holding it  Yeah you don't want to do that  I was hungry and it was a candy bar  You don't want to do the  Your word against the cops though  Because usually that doesn't work  Never works  Yeah it doesn't  Well Anthony we got two great audio clips  Yeah  So where do we go with this  Well we have to  We got to start with the wet dream one  You want to do that one first  Yeah  I also found a couple more tunes from 
[02:32:00]  Apathy  Apathy  The Hype Bombers band  Awful stuff  Yeah  Horrid  All right so you brought in this  Instructional video  Yeah  And there was a section on there  About trainables  How to talk about sex to  That's what they called them back in the day  To the slow people  Right  Retards  The retarded  Whatever you want to call  Right  But it was made  Back in the days when  They didn't really care about being  Politically correct 
[02:32:30]  You know what I mean  So  One woman walks in on her son  Jackin  And kind of explains to him that  It's okay  Well that's the other one  Yeah  And then there's another one  This is the one we're going to play  The one we're going to play is  I don't know who this guy is  He's a lot older  He looks like he runs some type of  Maybe  A home for these people  Home for the Tards  Okay  And he walks in  Maybe this particular Tard  Was kind of  Tossed aside  You think  Into one of these places  Well he walks in 
[02:33:00]  That's what I'm thinking  Because it wasn't like a father  Or an uncle  No  No  Walks in  And the kid's all sweating  It's a big greasy mess  And he's in bed  And the guy asks the kid  What the problem is  Right  And the kid tells him  Apparently he had a wet dream  Right  This is how they explain  What to do about that  Hey Frank  How come you haven't gotten up yet  I'm wet and sticky  I'm wet and sticky 
[02:33:30]  He woke up  He's a little confused  The poor little guy  He doesn't know  What the F just happened  He don't know what happened  All he knows is  Felt great  And he woke up wet and sticky  And what the hell  Do you do now  Hey Frank  How come you haven't gotten up yet  I'm wet and sticky  Oh  What  When did that happen  Did it happen during the night  Or did it just happen now  Do you know 
[02:34:00]  No  Well  If you're sticky  Maybe it was a wet dream  Do you know what a wet dream is  No  Well you know  How old are you now  You must be about  That's the musical interlude  As I guess he's talking to him about it  Explaining what  Occurred  The counselor shows a calm  Accepting approach to this boy  Who has just had a wet dream  There is no scolding or recrimination 
[02:34:30]  No  The boy is not frightened  And there is no reason for him to feel guilty  Frank I'm sure you understand now  Just what happened  And that this is probably going to happen  Quite a few times more  Like it does to everybody else  And it's quite normal right  I think the best thing we can do now  Is to show you how to clean it up  Okay  Oh  And then he starts pulling the blanket back  On the kid  He's going to help him clean up  Oh  God  And God knows how long it's been there 
[02:35:00]  It looks like mashed potato flakes  On his stomach  You know what I'm talking about  Calamine lotion  Yeah  Just when you start getting used to those things  They go away  God damn it  Remember just waking up and go  Oh  Hey that was cool  Oh  That was a nice ride  Guiltless sex  And not worry about any STDs  Or pregnancy  Nothing  You wake up 
[02:35:30]  You're wet  I'm sticky  That's all you got to worry about  Cleaning up the mess  Well the next clip is priceless  Anthony  The mom walks in on one of these kids  Yeah  And he's in the middle of doing  What little boys do best  And she  From what it appears  The way she sounds  It sounds like she had a  In case your son's jacking it  Break glass thing  With these words behind it  Because this is  Doesn't sound like a very spontaneous speech  No  Sounds like something she'd rehearsed a few times  Yeah  So let's play this audio  Many people believe that important elements of sex education 
[02:36:00]  Are social behavior and responsibilities  Social acceptability involves being comfortable with one's own sexuality  Spanking it  Kids just jacking  Yeah  Yeah the video is  Door flies open  Well they're nowhere  They show the doorknob first  Right  And the kids just jacking  Doorknob's moving  Door opens  Oh no  The mother looks on the bed 
[02:36:30]  And oh my god  There's our little boy  Cranking it  Oh  Excuse me Ricky  Ricky  I did see what you were doing  It felt good didn't it  It's alright  We all have feelings like this sometimes  Yeah  I'm just glad you're doing this in the privacy of your own room  When you're a little bit older  We'll have to talk more about these feelings  And what causes them  And how we can control these feelings  I'm sorry I intruded on your privacy 
[02:37:00]  I'll be sure to knock next time  Okay  That's right bitch  Now let me get back to Cranking  This manner of response frees the child of guilt  And assures him he is normal  It opens communication between parent and child  And introduces the concept of responsibility for his behavior  Please  It's a boner killer if there ever was one  No doubt  Like the kid's just going to be able to take up where he left off  He's having a great jack 
[02:37:30]  And then mom walks in and gives you that speech  Not enough to make you feel pretty god damn icky if you ask me  The reality is my mom would have had a nervous breakdown  Really?  She would have ran out of the room screaming  I jacked like a rabbit  Didn't your mom catch you though?  When I was a kid never got caught  Never got caught  How the hell do you get caught?  First of all the retarded kid's laying there cranking it  He leaves his door  His door's right there where if he opens it up  Or if his mom opens it up 
[02:38:00]  He's in plain view  Jacking  Do something  Put a little something in the door  Lock it  I don't know if he doesn't have a lock  Do the laying on your side face in the wall  A knock home alone jerk  Toss it in the pillow  Hey Jay  That's that quiet  What's up?  Hey Jay Moore everyone  I've been caught  Have you?  Oh yeah it was humiliating  By who your wife?  Don't you remember?  Uh no 
[02:38:30]  No I got  I was like  First of all hello gentlemen  Hello Jay Moore  I got great news for you tonight  You might remember him from the gay rodeo skit on more sports  Jay hysterical  It's good stuff  Thanks guys  That was so god damn funny  Man I never knew you were so  Gay?  Open minded let's say  You're so liberal  When the guy blindfolded me and spanked me with a paddle  Not as bad as you shirtless with your arms above your head  With two gay guys rubbing suntan lotion on your body 
[02:39:00]  On those tight abs of yours Jay  Anthony the sun was you know southern California sun  It was very hot  The last thing you want to do on a field remote is come home sunburned  Yeah so I have two flaming gay guys rub the lotion on  What am I going to do?  Look around for straight guys?  It's the gay rodeo for crying out loud  It rubs the lotion on its skin or else it gets the hose again  And then you teamed up with a gay guy to put underpants on what a goat or something?  On a goat  Yeah it was madness  And you know what?  Sadly we did not take last place in dressing the goat in underpants 
[02:39:30]  There's actually gay rodeo stars  They came in after the talk show host and his fake gay friend  Well you didn't care what it looked like on  They probably wanted it just so  You know what the line killed Jay?  You show a sign that says thanks for coming  And you look at the camera and go  And this isn't even the exit  Yeah  Thanks for coming  I like gay TM  The gay TM  I think it's just going  Ha ha ha ha  You guys are  Tonight  Guess who  I got Suge Knight tonight  Get out of here 
[02:40:00]  Do you ask the tough questions?  Absolutely  What do you think is the first question I asked him?  Did you hang Vanilla Ice out by him?  Yes  Yes  Yes  Yes  That's the first effing question I asked him  That's the first thing I had to ask him  And what did he say?  He goes  I don't recall  And I said me neither  I was in the bathroom  I didn't see nothing  Suge  I was in the bathroom the whole time  You're a smart guy  Yeah  We're down with the row now baby  We're down with the row  Was he cool?  He was super cool  You better say that  No he was 
[02:40:30]  I was changing his image  I don't know how much I would  He's trying to come across as like a cool guy that you want to like now  He came in like two hours late  And he brought this rapper  He wanted to come out with him  And all the producers are running around like  He wants to bring out Crooked Eye  That was the name of his rapper  And I said who cares?  Just set up another chair  I don't give a crap  As long as I get to ask him another ice question  Sit Crooked Eye down  Amofo  And Dave Navarro performs acoustic with another guy  Wow nice  Really awesome  Does he rub suntan lotion on you Jay? 
[02:41:00]  No he was  He met Suge Knight though  And he said he met Clinton two weeks before  And he said meeting Suge Knight was cooler  Oh  I would think  Hey I got a question for that guy  I was doing 150 miles an hour through a construction zone in D.C.  With Kwame Brown  With a family of Haitians in my trunk  And a heroin needle  Coming out of my bag  And an eight ball in my crotch  What do I do?  Can I just pin it all on Kwame Brown?  Now how much  How long did you rehearse that before you rattled that off?  That was pretty good  Oh man  Come on  Don't bite the ball that feeds you 
[02:41:30]  Come on brother  Jay's a professional actor  That's from the top of his head  He knows it  And we got Sandy Allison in studio Jay  The last time  I called once and she was on already  She's that sexy woman that talks about sex  She has a book  Tickle Your Fancy  A Woman's Guide to Sexual Self-Pleasure  Women self-pleasuring Jay  I'm all for my wife self-pleasuring herself  Good for you  Yeah gets her going  Sometimes Sandy I come home  And there's stuff plugged in  On walls  Next to like certain angles  Sandy Sandy whatever  That can only be used in a certain way 
[02:42:00]  And I just say  Hey great  You know what that means to me Sandy?  What is that?  She's ready for some serious lumber  That's right  And you know I'm so glad that you're open to it  And that's one of the biggest myths  That most men out there  Feel inadequate  If their woman self-pleasures  Oh no  It's ridiculous  Because really you want your woman  To be into herself  Because then she's going to be more into you  When you guys are making love  How do you get her to do it in front of you there  Sandy?  You ask nicely  Eh they get a little embarrassed  Why don't you start yourself  And say now you do it 
[02:42:30]  Oh so you just start cranking it  Yeah  And then she goes  Did you learn that at the gay rodeo?  Did you laugh at the gay rodeo?  Then your chick goes  I saw what you were doing there  And it's totally normal  Jay I didn't realize how great of an actor you were  Let's just put it that way  I hope that was acting  Tonight on the show I go curling  And let me tell you something  If I can't make curling interesting  It's hopeless  Yeah  Yeah cool  We lost to the United States Olympic curling team  One nothing  Of course you did 
[02:43:00]  Me and like my writing staff  We lost one nothing to Olympic curlers  What does that mean?  It means it's lawn darts on ice  It's the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life  So you're saying you did well?  It's literally  This is how stupid it is  Put a shooting target on the ice  Like a bullseye more points  Uh huh  And you roll the 42 pound stone  It's bocce ball slash shuffleboard on ice  What are the brooms for Jay?  The brooms are for sweeping  To make the stone go faster 
[02:43:30]  So it doesn't get held up  What if you need to slow it down?  You don't sweep as much  Nothing  I'm telling you  It's the dumbest thing in the world  Sounds it  Well we got Dave Navarro playing acoustic  And we got Suge Knight  And I want to tell you about  When I got caught cranking  Oh go ahead  I thought this would be kind of funny  I was watching the Cars video  Summer got me upside down  You remember that song?  Sure  And they had all the chicks by the pool  Like in their bikinis  Yeah  So I'm on my couch 
[02:44:00]  MTV was new  Your mom caught you?  Hold on now  Oh no  Let's go  I'm cranking  And I'm like right at the  Barry Katz the big Jew walks in  Right?  I'm right at the point  Where uh  You know  Sound and shapes and colors  Just kind of go out the window  You're at that little precipice  Before it's blasted off  Right  We're like  You don't even really care at this point  Yeah  And uh  Rick Ocasek was walking on water  And there was three chicks around him  In bikinis  And I  You know  I'm like 13  I said  Oh yeah  There they go 
[02:44:30]  And uh  My mom  And my sister Julie  Come in with like  Arms filled with grocery bags  Oh  Oh and he digs it up  And they dropped all the groceries  I ran out of the house  In my socks  I did not come home  You were completely nude Jay  No no no  Uh oh  It's magic  It's true  It's magic  Hey mom  I dream  Oh  Oh  So check this out 
[02:45:00]  I'm wearing just  I'm wearing my socks  Yeah  You can play this song  Oh yeah  Let it rip  Upside down  I'm cranking  And my mommy  Walking down  She dropped the groceries  On the floor  Yeah  This is a well produced show  When you find that song 
[02:45:30]  That's the magic  That is Ben  And what  So you were wearing your socks  And what else  I was wearing like normal clothes  I just didn't have any shoes on  And you had it out  Well yeah  It was kind of like  It was kind of like  Peeking out the top of my pants  Type deal  Like just the helmet  And you're going to town  And they walk in  They drop all the groceries  My sister goes  What are you doing  Oh  That was embarrassing  And uh  So then I run out of the house  In my socks  And literally 
[02:46:00]  When I tell you  It was like midnight  It was midnight  I was walking around  Verona, New Jersey  In my socks  And then finally  My mom pulled up next to me  In the car  Oh  Get in  I said  It happens to everyone  Get in  Oh  With all your disgusting guilt  You're still probably  Because if you just ran out of the house  Did you have byproduct on you?  No  I never got there  Ah  Here's audio of Jay  Talking to his mom in the car  It's all gooey  I love in that clip you played 
[02:46:30]  When the guy asked  The retarded guy  How old he was  Yeah  Like what kind of home  Are you running?  You don't know how old  Your occupants are  But you know  That's a tricky question  Because most retarded people  You think they're like  13 years old  Because of the way they act  And they're like  44  And you're like  Oh yeah that's right  I've known you my whole life  Yeah  Hey Jay  Your neighbor was peeking in  As you were doing this  To the cars  Red rocket  Red rocket  Red rocket  Red rocket is right baby 
[02:47:00]  And uh  Yeah that moment  It was definitely purple rocket  Jay turning to his mother  As she pulls up in the car  I got nowhere else to go  I got nowhere else to go  That's awesome  Cars man  Here's uh  Here's Jay getting caught  And what he had to say  No  All right  Wonderful  Are you playing

[03:10:30]  This was a guy  He sent in and he says  He says  The cop stopped me  Pulled me over  Wanted to know why I was speeding  So fast  And he said  I'm so sorry officer  I just came from the clinic  And I was getting treatment  For genital warts  Oh how about that  And I'm rushing to the  To the drugstore  To get the cream  To cool it down  Cause you know  They like burn these things off  With like liquid nitrogen  Or something  He has the cop the brochure  To show him how it happens  The cop's like  Just get out of here  So he had to do  A little advanced planning  So he's telling everyone  To get the brochure  Keep it in your glove compartment  Get the brochure  Stop by the clinic 
[03:11:00]  Pick yourself up  A genital warts treatment brochure  Oh that's good  Then another one of my  Mom goes through your car  Yeah exactly  Then you got another guy  This guy  The first time it happened to him  It was a true story  But anyway he tells the cop  And he gets pulled over  He says  Look I'm sorry officer  He says  I live on a third story  Apartment building  My water bed sprung a leak  This morning  And I couldn't find  A garden hose around  Anywhere  That drained the thing  So I had to run out  Of my office  To get the garden hose  He had the garden hose  Right there with him  He said look  You can get me a ticket  If you want  But you're going to have  To follow me back  Cause it's flooding  The downstairs apartment  Right now  And he's like  Ah don't worry about it  Get out of here  So now the guy  Carries the garden hose  Around with him  He's gotten out of  Seven tickets in a row 
[03:11:30]  Using the garden hose  Then got a whole section  Of female only excuses  This is my favorite one  From a chick  She writes in  And she said  I'm sorry officer  About ten minutes ago  I tripped  And I fell down  A flight of stairs  She said  I'm rushing to the hospital  Cause I think  One of my implants  Just sprung a leak  Oh  Yeah  Well she has to have implants  Yeah  She didn't have implants  Really  She said  Funny thing is  I don't have implants  Another one of my  Favorite female excuses  Was this chick  She said look  She said  I'm so sorry officer  She said  I gotta pee really bad 
[03:12:00]  And you know  If you're a guy  He's just gonna say  Okay great  I'll just write the ticket faster  But the clincher was  He said  I have an excruciatingly  Painful bladder infection  Cops like  Let that one go  Every time  Then another one  That was really cool  Is this guy  This guy  He gets stopped  He pretends  To be a mute  Oh that's interesting  And he's got a blank  Pad of paper  And when the cop  Comes up to the window  He just writes  Hello officer  On his blank pad of paper  And hands it to the cop  And the cops always  Feel so sorry for him  Cause they're like  Oh my god  This poor guy  Can't even  He can't even talk

[03:20:30]  I went to a play  Recently  Yeah  And my voice is changing  Uh  And uh  I went to see The Graduate  Oh you did  How was it  How was that  That's with that um  Kathleen  Kathleen  Kathleen  Turner  And uh  Jason Biggs  Biggs  Biggs  Sure sure  How was it by the way  Well that's the announcement  I thoroughly enjoyed it  Uh huh  I thought the acting was fabulous  The lighting was fabulous  Uh  I thought uh  The security guards  Couldn't have been nicer  Oh really 
[03:21:00]  Yeah they taught me  How much did that cost  The ticket  That cost me $45  But then there's a service charge  Of $1.25  Yeah  Which I didn't realize  Until after  I bet you didn't  Until after  You didn't even know  There was a service charge  Had a bottle of water  For $4.50  Oh you did  Yeah  Six ounces of water  Oh nice  Is it true we have audio  Of you from the uh  I don't know how you would have that  Rochester  Okay  Is this audio of you Paul  Are you willing to finally admit it 
[03:21:30]  It's rough  Oh my god  Athlete put your god damn clothes back on  Really  That kept the cell  Seemed kind of far away  Yeah that was  Is there anything closer  Maybe there was a  Maybe there was some microphone  Closer to you  At that point  Could that have been possible  Let's listen  Oh god  This is rough  Hold on  Kathleen  Put your god damn clothes back on 
[03:22:00]  Sounds like Tony Soprano to me  Are you finally admitting that you did it  Are you fessing up to this finally  Finally  Kathleen  Put your god damn clothes back on  Yeah  Finally  Paul Mercurio  Paul Mercurio  I thought I was going to have a heart attack  Just before I did it  Wow  The famous voice  You're a pussy  It took you two months  To finally take the credit  Get out of here  He wanted to make sure  Everything was blown over 
[03:22:30]  And there were no repercussions  I have  Paul Mercurio  Is the guy that went to the graduates  And when Kathleen Turner  Was completely naked on the stage  He stood up in front of everyone  And said  Kathleen put your god damn clothes back on  Yeah  We had three or four guys in the place with microphones  Yes  Very  Here's another angle  Very secretive  Of Paul Mercurio doing that  Oh my god  Kathleen put your god damn clothes back on  I can't believe you just called me a pussy 
[03:23:00]  I know  He does that  And he's a pussy  You didn't do it  I'm in here two days before  And you're like  You're like  I wonder if we could just find somebody  You could go to the thing  And stand up and yell  But you go  I say I'm going to go  And I go  But it took you so long to take the credit  You're a hero  And the listener is  Hey John Stewart  Put your god damn clothes back on  Alright I'll stop  Jesus  Alright you're not a pussy  You're finally admitting it  It was Paul Mercurio  Yes  Bravo 
[03:23:30]  So now he has the godfather music  Because he's inducted into the mob now  The mafia mob  That is the Opie and Anthony show  Well I thought the whole thing was a scam  Because like two minutes before the play starts  It's Paulie Balls  Thank you  Paul thought  We forgot to tell people  Paul thought we were setting him up  Well there's this whole thing  And we go in  And we're not supposed to make eye contact  And I go down  And I go into the men's room  And there's like every guy going to the men's room  And then Rick goes in  And I go in  It is Broadway  And so we're in the thing  And I'm in the stall  And I see  Thank god I looked at his shoes  Because I recognized his shoes 
[03:24:00]  So I was done checking for fissures and stuff  And then he hands me the thing  All you needed was like the Mission Impossible theme  He hands me the thing  The recorder  He just turns it on for me  He hands it to me  And I put it in the thing  And I go out  And it took like 15 minutes to get that together  Right Rick?  Yeah about that  Am I boring you with this?  Now go go  So you crawled through the ventilation system  To get to your seat  So I crawled through the ventilation system  Just for good measure  I did warm up  And I punched an old lady in the heart  I couldn't help myself 
[03:24:30]  There were 300 people there  Come on people  You got him  And so then I go to sit down  And as it's getting closer  Literally my heart is like  It's boom  Ba-boom  Ba-boom  And I go to sit down  And Rick  The plan is  He comes and sits next to me  But nobody  We don't know each other  So Rick sits next to me  Yeah  And you know  He gives a  And he's like really  Like he's really acting it out  There's no one else around  But he's acting it out  He looks at the little number  Excuse me  Is that just sit down  For god's sake  Was the tape recorder taped 
[03:25:00]  Behind the toilet  In the bathroom  That was exactly  What it felt like  You know that moment  As you hear the subway coming  And his eyes are darting  Back and forth  Yeah  So I'm sitting there  And then Rick  Just before it starts  Before the lights go down  Rick gets up  Uh oh  And then the play starts  And Rick is not coming back  So now you're thinking  So I'm seeing the two of you  Off somewhere  Laughing your ass off  Drinking beer  Going  But Jerry  We totally screwed  I don't know if it's on  I don't know if it's off  I don't know if I should do this  That's the beauty of the show  You're never quite sure 
[03:25:30]  Right exactly  And I was going to say  This is like the sting  This is like a con  Within a con  Within a con  It's like Chinese dolls  Actually we were going to have  Which would be a fun idea  That we might do next time  Instead of a recording device  Have a radio control taser  So we can sit there  And then just tase you  In your seat  And as you convulse  The security comes  Everyone laughs  So I'm sitting there  And I look  I say okay  I'm going to just look back once  Because I don't want to look suspicious  Meanwhile I'm also checking  Yeah I'm also checking  The mic  The recorder 
[03:26:00]  To make sure I didn't  Actually hit it  And I don't even know  If it's on or not  So I've got to keep checking it  And I'm reading this thing  But I'm not really reading  The words in the program  Yeah  There's a lot going through my mind  I'm seeing my wife  Flash before my eye  Sure  Kathleen Turner  The night that we had together  That's all by the board  It's a big big moment  That was coming up  Oh my god  Really bad  What an abortion  Really  I felt so good about the fact  I was going to do it  When the play started  And then we stand up  She had that effective noise  Going  Did she have that thing going  Oh  Oh 
[03:26:30]  Well let me tell you something  It's like  It's really breathy  And over the top  Do you find me sexy  Exactly  Shut up  What's the kid's name  In this play  Not Biggs  Jason Biggs  Jason Biggs  Come in and that's like  Watching a bag of rocks  Oh my god  Really just bad  It was literally like  Watching an acting class 101  Where two people  Think they're really good  And she comes on  And she's like  Oh sir  Please get me  Benjamin  Is his name  Benjamin  Do you find me  Please help me  With the  Over the top  It was like a horse  In a dress  It was ridiculous 
[03:27:00]  Oh my god  And as every moment  Was going on  I was like 50 minutes in  I felt more and more  Better about myself  That I was going to do  That you were going to do it  Well I think I felt  Like I was doing it  For the world  Oh you had a lot  For everybody  Listen again  You have a lot of confidence  Man  It's on the bed  Oh god  If this rocks  Hold on  Kathleen  Put your god damn  Clothes back on  It's like you're angry with her  You're angry with the woman  I have to take  Some acting classes  I really got in the head 
[03:27:30]  Put your god damn  Clothes back on  I was angry with her  Because it was such bad  It was like  It's such a good idea  To put that as a play  But it was such bad  It was so like  And the only reason  She's naked  Is no one would go to that  On the basis of the exact thing  It was to see her  Roly-poly  Michele  You know what's  Bushy  You know what's great  That took place  About 15 minutes in  Yeah  Imagine if you had to sit  Through like an hour  And a half  I would have jumped the stage  You would have said  No it's a guy  I would have  Kathleen put  You suck you bitch 
[03:28:00]  CF  I would have decapitated  Jason Biggs  And pooped down his neck  Wonderful though  I'm surprised  That more people  Didn't like  Comment and say something  So really  I was about to abort  The mission  Because I look back  You thought you were  Being set up now  And then I look back  And I see him  Standing at the pole  And I'm like  What's he doing at the pole  I don't know what's going on  I'm thinking  Okay well he wants to get it  From another angle  So Rick's at the pole  And I'm sitting there  And I'm waiting  And I'm waiting  And I just remember  And then I had to keep  Telling myself  Don't say put your clothes 
[03:28:30]  Back on  I was wondering  I mean put your  I mean don't  Take your clothes off  Right  So I kept saying  I said put your clothes  So I'm waiting  I'm waiting  I'm waiting  And man I'll tell you  It was literally like  That scene in The Godfather  Where he's sitting at the table  And he's about to pop  He's ready to shoot him  And he's ready to shoot him  And you're like  And you can hear  And I just  Man I just didn't want  My voice to crack  And you were thinking  Of that scene  It's a good thing  You didn't go  Hey McCluskey  Put your god damn  Clothes back on  Hey Salazzo  Hey Phil Cutlet Parmesan  Put your clothes back on  So I stand up 
[03:29:00]  And I turn right  A little bit  Like I'm standing up  In radio  Like people make it matters  And I turn right  Shot Lincoln in the head  To the  I turn to the house  You know  To project  To project  I wanted to make  I was so panicky  That you were  Mr. Faber-Sham  Put your god damn  Clothes back on  So I do it  And I think  You know  And you hear  Horrified people  You have audio  Yeah  We just got like  A woman  Most of the people  Were pussies  In the place 
[03:29:30]  They really just  I think in this age  Of terrorism  You being a  Broadway show  Terrorist  Which is pretty much  What you were  You were terrorizing  The performers  They pretty much  Just figured  It was a safe bet  To shut up  Yeah but you know  I would have said  Something  Yeah  I would have said  Well then again  I'm the guy that yelled  You yelled it  Of course you're going  To say something  The best part  Was the discussion  He had with the usher  That wanted to kick out  Well what happened  Was I had to do  A lot of work  For you guys  Because I not only  Did I have to yell  Then I had to  Create an argument  I had to generate 
[03:30:00]  An argument  As to why you did this  And why it's right  So the guy  So the woman comes over  She opens the curtain  She closes the curtain  One of the usher  She closes the curtain  Nothing happens  I'm thinking  Did she get a bead on you though  Did she make eye contact  No because I just sat there  And I was just looking at the thing  It wasn't like  I was like pointing at myself  I'm the guy  I put the clothes back on  I'm the clothes back on guy  So this big big huge  Black security guard  With bald shaved head  Comes over  And he stands like  In the area  So I just start talking to myself  Out loud  This is totally unacceptable 
[03:30:30]  I cannot believe  You're doing the crazy  Talking guy  He comes walking over to me  And he knows immediately  Right on cue  And he leans in  And he goes  Sir I'm going to have to  Not to  Excuse me  Well you have it  Well you want to play it in  You've got to listen closely  Yeah  Because the guy  He got in close to you  I guess  The mic was through  My buttonhole  And my jacket  I was talking right in  So Marcellus Wallace  Leans over  Right  All right  Let's listen in  This place is terrible 
[03:31:00]  Yes  I think that's  Ridiculous  What?  That's offensive  No I'm not going to get up  No  So now the guy is basically saying  Come on  Follow me  Get up  His head was all sweaty  Get up  The top of his head was all sweaty  Get up and follow me  I'm not getting up  I'm not getting up  How dare you  You feel that stinging 
[03:31:30]  That's pride  Fing with you  I think this is offensive  Get out of the theater  And I'll give you a refund  Now come this way  Betty threatens me  It's necessary for her  To take her clothes off  I'm offended  So  Come this way  Come this way  I'm sure  Oh  You found each other  You certainly did  I'm ashamed about this  But now  You have to drive home  Now what did he say there? 
[03:32:00]  To take you out  Say what one more time  Say what?  Say what?  He said  If I have to take you out physically  I will  And I'll get you locked up  And then I said  On what basis  Can you get me locked up?  Now you're being belligerent  It caused the disturbance  In the house  And now  They want you out  But then he gets cocky  And goes  Okay  Let's go  Let's go  Alright  I'll show you  I'll leave  That's my favorite line  Pretty much it  Let's go  Alright  You can't take me out physically 
[03:32:30]  On what basis?  Good night  I'm disturbing  If I'm not sore  I can't do so  Why does she have to be locked up?  I'm not going to the corner  I'm getting late  I'll give you a reason  I'm leaving  All right  Let's go  That is ridiculous  You leave  Alright let's go  But then at one point  You know  We were in a totally enclosed area  Just he and I  Because there were curtains  And I thought he was 
[03:33:00]  Just beat you  Just beat the crap out of you  I got an earring  I figured he was gay  So I was fine  Yeah well  Well maybe not  I don't know  The guy was  The guy was just like  He handled  I gotta give him credit  He handled it well  Because he could have  Like made a huge thing about it  And like grabbed me  But then he's getting you  Out of the row  And you're talking to  All the people around you  Well yeah  Because I'm thinking  I got this thing rolling  And I  You know  My underwear is soaked  With sweat at this point  That's rough  I'm having a baby down here  I'm like freaking out  I'm like I gotta get  Something out of this  So as I'm walking  I'm looking at the people  Going you know  You should be ashamed  I'm doing like 
[03:33:30]  Crazy Joe guy  On the corner  Right  Screaming at people  And people are looking at me  But nobody wants to say  Anything to me  Because I'm not  They're petrified  Because now you're  Playing crazy guy  And then as I thought  About it afterwards  What I should have done  Was when I walked by you  Rick I should have  Like made eye contact  With you  And started in with you  Like what are you looking at  Oh big brawl  Oh a brawl  Could have been good  Would have been good  Brawl  Take him out  Beat him with my junk  Oh my god  Rick could have just been  Oh what's he doing  Then they get you out  Near the box office  And you ask for the service charge  He asks for his money back  And the service charge 
[03:34:00]  I'm out like  Near the box office  And all these people  Sitting around  And they're just  All doing the same thing  They're like sipping coffee  Or drinking drinks  And they're just staring at me  They're like freaked out  The freak guy  That yelled out  And I'm pacing  I'm pacing back and forth  You did the perfect thing  Being the crazy guy  Because they just want  To resolve the situation  Yes  You were offended by this  They don't want anything like that  And you don't swear  You don't do any of that  And every once in a while  You throw something in  That sounds like  You know the law  Right  Oh good  Government's property  Government's property  Legal justification 
[03:34:30]  And so the guy  And they couldn't move fast enough  Behind the register  The woman's like  You know she's got fries  Fries are flying everywhere  When they give you back  The money to jail  No backs  No backs  No penny tax  Because that would have  Really put him in a position  Where well no backs  Right  Sure  Alright well  We've got to move on  But Paul Mercurio  Finally taking responsibility  Bravo  Wow  What a set of nuts  Which made for great radio  Great radio  You've got more on  You're a god  In the listener's mind

What?  Seattle can't have this bit  Why not?  You don't know how to do it  No, you don't know how to do it right  Sacramento knows how to do the three hour late bit  You stink  Oh  All right, I'll take it  Goodbye  Goodbye  Good day, sir  He stinks and I don't like him  Good day, sir  You aren't your bowler? 
[03:46:30]  My bowler  Good day  Good day, sir  Anthony, I want to personally apologize to Sacramento  Yeah  Thinking that maybe another city could do the Sacramento bit  I'm sorry  I will never do that to Sacramento again, Anthony  The three hour late bit is Sacramento's bit  Seattle  Right  Patty  Yeah  You had some problems yesterday  We got in a big fight with your landlord  You're no longer allowed to live at the apartment you were renting for $25 a week  Right  You got booted out  Yes  We offered you $906 yesterday to cut off what hair you've grown in the past eight months 
[03:47:00]  Since the last time we shaved your head  That's right  You accepted the challenge  Yes  You have now found a new place to live  Not yet  What happened is I came back to where I was  I found all my stuff packed up nicely  Oh, it was packed up like they were kicking you out  In boxes and bags  Yeah  And they made me give back the key  So I did  And then I just went and called up somebody  That called him yesterday who could help me move everything  So I got him 
[03:47:30]  And then I also just found a place to store everything in  Up on like  I hope he doesn't move as slow as you talk  You're never going to get moved out  But anyway  Isn't that funny?  They boxed up all her junk  But she's never had junk in her box  Isn't that like it's just this strange coincidental thing  So now I don't have to worry about where my things are going  I have a place to store them  I just have to worry about me now  And that's it  How do I care?  Why?  So where did you sleep last night? 
[03:48:00]  In a hotel?  Yes  Joyce was very nice  Yeah, I know  She told us all that  Okay, where are you sleeping tonight?  I'm sleeping in the hotel again  Oh, again  But then I check out tomorrow at 12 noon  And I have no idea where you're going to be sleeping tomorrow night  No, but all I have to worry about is just where I'm going  Yeah, she's staying at the Ritz  But instead of an R, it's an SH in front  So it's almost the same  You know  Patty  Patty  Yes  For some reason, do you know Patty's got to go on a date?  What?  Oh, I heard that 
[03:48:30]  With Al Dukes from Ron and Fez show  They bet that Earl wouldn't get into the Rolling Stones conference  But everybody else knew better  And he got in  He got in  So now  Because he's got his connections  So now wait a minute  Patty, you don't date  This is like your first date you're going on  Stop, are you kidding me?  I know  It's crazy to believe, right?  Because Al's gay, so  Al is such a flaming faggot  Nothing's going to happen on this date  Nothing's going to happen  Your virginity will remain intact  Do you know she's a virgin?  Oh, I know that  But I'm very happy to be enjoying my guilt 
[03:49:00]  45 years old  She's got so much guilt because of the Catholic Church  That she has not been able to pleasure  Give her one of these self-pleasure kits you've been handing out to everybody  Yeah, do you have a little toy you could give the girl to?  I have a toy for her and one of my books  Do you self-pleasure, Patty?  Patty, do you?  Do you touch yourself down there?  Yeah, she does  To the edge from you, too  Do you?  Yeah  She has a fantasy about the edge from you, too  Yeah  Actually, it's just about his hat  Yeah, it's just the hat  He's in such a headwear  Well, we've got to wrap this up, Patty  Because we're running out of time  So you have no place to live tomorrow 
[03:49:30]  But it doesn't bother you, right?  No, the half of a load is off my mind  With where to put my things  Again, half a load is off of mine  But there's never  You know, if all I have to do is just worry of that  Where will you sleep, do you think?  Well, I'm going to make some bones  You're off to the couch outside the studio  Yeah  You know, that'll be, you know, if worse comes to the worst  All right, hold on, Michelle  You want a good place to sleep?  Go to the play of The Graduate  You'll not  Not right now  Too many people yelling to get a good night's sleep  No one will yell in there again 
[03:50:00]  Michelle, real fast  It's not Michelle, it's Strawberry  But I feel really bad for Patty  And if she needs a place to stay  I'll be happy to take her in  Oh, yeah?  No rent as long as she needs it  Wow  It's not a problem  She's a really nice person  All right, cool  Hold on a line, Strawberry  But you have to look at all of her knick-knacks  Which are all strawberry-related  Our listeners are coming through like crazy for Patty  Now, when I heard it's like inviting a tick to your leg  It's like it just won't leave  I think the last person where Patty stayed  They actually had to burn her head with a cigarette out of the house 
[03:50:30]  She wouldn't leave  Because if the head stays, it'll just get infected  It'll infect the whole house  Patty, she's got legs like a relief mat  All right  Patty, will you be doing the contest tomorrow?  The O&A money snatch thing?  Of course, if I'm allowed to, I will  You know, if not  You'll be completely naked with the rest of the girls?  And you know the twist, right?  Yeah, I do  All right  All right, well, we should let her do it then  Patty, you're in if you want to be  Okay  All right, so we'll see you tomorrow  Absolutely  I'm not going to be the winner, but okay 
[03:51:00]  I mean  You'll scrape up a few bucks  And you'll allow us to shave your head again for $906?  Sure  All right, we just got to figure out when we're going to do that in  All right  Because now we're going to hit the road  I know  You know, tomorrow we got the money snatch thing  Thursday and Friday we hit the road in Philly and D.C.  I'm starting to think, Ann, that we do it in the middle of our celebrity softball game  Well, I'll shave her hair  Yeah  Okay  I thought you meant to do that  All right  In the middle of the softball game  Because we can put her big retard head  Yeah, right on the big huge jumbotron 
[03:51:30]  On the jumbotron  And everyone could enjoy as we shave her head  On the jumbotron  That's what I'm starting to think  That's fine  Can we, after we cut our hair off  Can we switch the jumbotron to black and white  So it looks like Schindler's List  Because  Write some numbers on your arm  We saw her with her head shaved last time  And it really looked bad  I swear to God  It looked really, really bad  And instead of effing with the listeners  And teasing this damn thing  Should we make it official  And we'll do it at the celebrity softball game  We will do it at the celebrity softball game  Right on the pitchers mound 
[03:52:00]  We will shave Patty's head  Yeah, that game is Saturday, June 1st  Riverfront Stadium  Home of the Newark Bears  In Newark, New Jersey  Sponsored by Coors Light  Tickets are on sale now  There's not many left  You can get them through Ticketmaster  Can we get, like, one of the Army people that do it?
