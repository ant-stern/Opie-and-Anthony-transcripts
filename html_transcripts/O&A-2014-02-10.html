<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a pre-show hosted by Sam Roberts, heavily focused on the previous Friday's "Super Show 2."  Roberts recapped the show's highlights, including the return of Jim Norton after his absence the previous week.  He detailed the antics of guests Dennis Falcone, "Lady Di," and Marion, particularly focusing on a controversial incident where Opie encouraged them to use racial slurs in a video, followed by a humorous apology.  The pre-show also reviewed other Super Show segments: a Twister game with Penthouse models and Bobo, notable for Bobo's body odor; Rich Vos's Asian jokes; Bonnie McFarlane's reactions; and various other segments. Other topics covered included Woody Allen's op-ed on child molestation, the 2014 Winter Olympics (including NBC's coverage and a false fatality rumor), and the show's ongoing 90 Day Fiancé segments.  Listeners called in with their opinions.  The pre-show concluded, transitioning to the main show with Opie, Anthony, Jim Norton, and Travis in studio.

The main show opened with a segment focusing on the attractiveness of female Winter Olympians, with Opie, Anthony, and a caller, Chris from Staten Island, making sexually explicit and suggestive comments about the athletes' appearances.  This transitioned into a discussion of Scott Shannon's unexpected retirement from the Scott and Todd show.  The hosts played and reacted to audio clips of Shannon's announcement, criticizing its perceived lack of sincerity.  They speculated on the reasons for his departure, including potential behind-the-scenes conflicts and tensions within station management.  The discussion revisited the recent Super Show, mentioning Rich Vos, Bonnie McFarlane, and Lady Di, and further critiqued management's handling of various situations.  The hosts also discussed Todd Pettengale's upcoming solo show.

The next segment continued the Scott Shannon discussion, focusing on his final on-air thank yous and comparing his abrupt departure to that of Bud Dwyer.  A humorous anecdote about Shannon's college nickname, "sex bagel," was shared.  Clips from Shannon's first day at a previous station were played, highlighting the contrast between his earlier energetic persona and his recent subdued farewell.  Speculation about the reasons for his departure continued, covering contract disputes, declining ratings, and chemistry issues with Todd.  The show then shifted to Valentine's Day advertisements, followed by a detailed and vulgar review of a 90 Day Fiancé episode, including sexually suggestive comments about the cast members.  A listener from the Philippines called in about a family member's kidnapping.  A call with Donald Rumsfeld followed, with the hosts jokingly questioning if he was a lizard person.  The segment concluded with a discussion and demonstration of NutriBullets.

A substantial portion of the show focused on 90 Day Fiancé, with Opie, Anthony, and possibly Jim Norton dissecting various couples' relationships, using vulgar language and crude humor.  Specific couples discussed included Mike and Aziza (with mockery of Mike's "ciggy breath") and Alan and Kirliam.  A listener called to complain about the "ciggy breath" phrase.  The segment included a phone call with Jenna Jameson, filled with crude jokes and sexual innuendo.  The hosts also spent time browsing and joking about mail-order bride websites.  Numerous advertisements aired throughout the segment.

Another segment featured a discussion about Celeste, a young woman about to have a Sports Illustrated photoshoot. The hosts speculated about her future, joking about her naiveté and the potential corrupting influences of the modeling industry.  This transitioned into a series of anecdotes from the hosts and callers about past romantic mishaps and the anxieties of young love, filled with vulgar language and explicit sexual references.  The discussion returned to Celeste's photoshoot and her boyfriend Alan's anxieties about her growing attractiveness and potential success.  The segment concluded with advertisements for Sherry's Berries, Vermont Teddy Bear, and other products.

The post-show, hosted by Sam Roberts, focused on the show's 90 Day Fiancé commentary and reminisced about past romantic struggles.  Caller Adam shared a vulgar anecdote about his high school experiences with women.  Dennis Falcone joined, describing the previous day's Super Show as a whirlwind of nudity and lap dances.  The conversation shifted to Valentine's Day gifts, with advertisements for gold-dipped roses and pajamas with "hidden secrets."  Caller Jimmy offered a cynical prediction about a 90 Day Fiancé couple.  The hosts discussed their diets and exercise habits, including Eric's beet juice concoction and aversion to gyms, with a clip of Eric making a smoothie.  Further advertisements for pajamagram.com (with sexually suggestive content) concluded the post-show.

[00:01:00]  Prepare for the incomparable Opie and Anthony show.  Only a show this big could have a pre-show this good.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show with Sam Roberts.  Welcome, welcome. Hope everybody had a good weekend.  And we're all ready for a Monday morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show live here on the Opie and Anthony channel, counting down the minutes. 
[00:01:30]  Until Opie and Anthony begin, I am Sam Roberts and you are you.  So, introduce yourself.  Call the show. 866-WOW1-WOW.  That's 866-969-1969.  We're going to be talking about what you're most looking forward to hearing about today on the show.  It was a big weekend.  A lot of stuff going on.  So there's a lot that Opie and Anthony have to get into today.  Of course, everything that happened on Friday's show. 
[00:02:00]  So, another classic Friday show.  Before we get into exactly what is going to go down today, Opie and Anthony will be here.  Jim Norton back in studio.  Jim was not here on Friday.  Friday was the day of Super Show 2.  Super Show has become a tradition now on the Opie and Anthony show.  I mean, I know that if it were up to us, we would do a show like this every Friday.  But you've got to space them out at least somewhat.  But Super Show 2 did not disappoint on Friday. 
[00:02:30]  It had me laughing all weekend.  I was listening to the replays and the best of show that air on the channel.  Listening on demand.  It was great.  866-WOW1-WOW.  866-969-1969 to call up now.  The pre-show started strong on Friday because Denny was in studio.  Dennis Falcone is, of course, our old school radio pal.  And when I say pal, I mean nuisance.  He's annoyed everybody who works here. 
[00:03:00]  All the talent on the show.  But for some reason, we can't stop having him in.  He's always got something.  I guess because we're waiting for there to be some kind of chink in the armor.  We're waiting for there to be a crack with this Dennis Falcone.  We're waiting for him to come in one day and become a real person.  And be angry at something.  Or have something to say about it.  Just break this weird character he has of the old school radio jock.  But he never does, which makes me think it's not a character at all. 
[00:03:30]  He intro'd the show and got everybody in a good mood.  And he was smart to do this with the first super group, Asia.  And we talked about that.  Here's the start of the super show from Friday.  Started by Dennis Falcone and the world's first super group, Asia.  I'm telling you right now, Asia's going to be in this tiny little studio.  I think it's going to happen.  I'm telling you right now, it's going to happen.  I haven't even asked for it to happen. 
[00:04:00]  I just know it's going to happen, though.  What a day that'll be.  Would you like it better to do it in this little studio?  It has to be in this little studio.  That's what I'm thinking, too.  It has to be.  They've got to be sick of playing arenas by now and stadium shows.  So tired of it.  So I want to make them feel at home.  Our home is your home.  Right.  See, kind of like us.  We were really sick of, you know, performing in front of a shitload of people.  Yeah.  So we just tamed it down a little and. 
[00:04:30]  Oh.  You're leaving now.  It's in your eyes.  In your eyes.  Danny on the one and two.  No disguising it.  It really comes as no surprise.  To find that you planned it all along.  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  Something fell. 
[00:05:00]  Rocked a little too hard there.  Yeah, a little too hard of some rocking.  The keyboard doesn't approve of Asia.  Super group Asia, of course.  Of course, Hopi.  Of course.  Super group Asia.  I love that Asia's become a thing on this show.  They suck so much, but they do.  But they are, I guess, releasing another album.  So I think Hopi's fan.  I agree with Hopi.  I think that fantasy is going to come true.  And I think Asia will go from once playing arenas to playing this small, tiny, Opie and Anthony studio. 
[00:05:30]  Not the closet that we broadcast out of.  The main studio, which is almost as small, that was filled with weirdos and strippers just three days ago.  Let's start on the phones with Nomad in Kansas.  Nomad, welcome to the Opie and Anthony pre-show.  What's up, Brian?  I'm Sam.  How you doing?  Oh, good, man.  I love the super show on Friday.  I've listened to the replay all week.  Lady Di is so fucking retarded, man. 
[00:06:00]  I can't even wrap my head around how stupid that woman is.  Well, you know what...  Yeah, go ahead.  So, as I was going to say, when you have her on the phone, then Hopi's purposely talking over her,  and you can just hear her in the background trying to fucking get a word in.  And then she does get your attention, and then she goes,  Hold on a second.  Just hold on a second.  Oh, my God.  And then she has nothing to say.  Thanks, Nomad.  You're right.  And she's on a whole other level when she's in person, like Nomad was saying, with Marion. 
[00:06:30]  Marion, her best friend and partner in crime, was with her on Friday's super show.  And, I mean, the thing that struck me being in studio was watching the conversations that these two were having in the studio off mic.  Because you look at these two talking to each other, and you get a glimpse of the fact that this goes on all day with them.  The Lady Di and the Marion that you heard on Friday are the people that they are off the air. 
[00:07:00]  Like, it was the first time that it really struck me that as much as this is sort of like a weird character study,  just bizarro world that we spend four hours in in the morning.  This is life for those two women.  Like, this is, this is, and the people that they share life with actually interact with them like we interact with people.  It really weirded me out.  But let me give you an example of what I'm talking about.  Marion was in, and the last time Marion was in studio with Opie and Anthony, 
[00:07:30]  Opie filmed a twerking video in the elevator with her, Lady Di, and DJ Who Kid.  And somehow, with Opie's magnificent powers of persuasion, got these two dopes to drop n-bombs on video.  And, of course, left that in the final cut.  Like, Marion was very upset about that because apparently she works with a very multicultural working force wherever she works.  So she didn't like that being on the internet. 
[00:08:00]  And Opie, with all the tact in the world, brought it up when she came in on Friday.  Marion, by the way, I'm sorry about the nigger thing.  Oh, wow.  What?  What happened?  Oh, shit.  She's waving you off.  She's waving you off.  Don't say that.  Don't say that.  I'm sorry about that.  But that was just...  You're cool with it?  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  Shut her off.  She's cool with it.  Play some music.  That never...  What?  What?  Don't take us to break.  Marion, shut her down.  Oh, it shut her right down. 
[00:08:30]  All I want to say is that you got a pass, though, from the DJ Who Kid.  Yeah, you got a pass.  You're good.  You're good.  You got the card.  You got the, you know, use it any time you want card.  DJ Who Kid, he cans those things out.  Where is Who Kid anyway?  Why?  Why did it shut her down?  She's like...  Wow, we learned...  We figured out how to get her quiet.  Ixnay on the igger-nay.  Don't want to talk about it?  You look mad.  What?  What happened?  But I just want to apologize. 
[00:09:00]  That was Pig Latin, by the way, or as I call it, Dilat.  I don't want to talk about it, guys, please.  What?  I don't want to talk about it.  Oh, shit.  I don't want to talk about it.  Did it...  Was it trouble?  I bet it was probably trouble, right?  I won't talk about it, but I'm just asking you one thing.  Was it trouble?  But everyone knows you're not a racist.  Did you get a talking to?  It wasn't about being a racist.  You're not a racist.  I know it wasn't.  But there were people that looked at it and thought, you know...  Thought you were a racist.  What?  Thought what? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah.  But everyone knows you're not a racist.  But everyone pulls that race card out of their ass.  Right.  You were just having fun.  And DJ Who Kid said it was cool.  DJ Who Kid was in the video.  If a black guy says it's cool, then you're allowed to say it.  It's fine.  Then it's fine.  I don't know that.  What?  What?  Oh, she works with a lot of black people.  Yeah, but they should understand the culture.  Marion, we know you hate those people, but it's okay.  All right.  Anthony.  What happened?  Nobody hates anybody.  Oh, well. 
[00:10:00]  I don't know.  We hate you.  We're past.  I just want to apologize.  Oh, okay.  You hate me.  I know.  All right.  We'll let it go.  All right.  All right.  I don't even know where to begin with that clip.  The thing that struck me at the end was the delayed reaction Lady Di had.  Five full seconds after Anthony says, I hate you.  Lady Di lets five seconds pass and then goes, wait, you hate me?  Or maybe it's the fact that Marion thinks that if she's in a live radio studio and puts a microphone five inches away from her face, 
[00:10:30]  she could just have a conversation that won't be on the air.  I don't know if she thought that wasn't on the air or if she thought it would just be more appropriate to position the mic slightly away from her.  Let's go to Josh in New Hampshire.  What's up, Josh?  Sammy.  What's up, buddy?  Can I get a time check?  Yes.  It's 10 minutes after the hour, less than 20 minutes before the Opie and Anthony show begins today.  What would I do without you?  I don't know.  You'd have to buy a watch.  And those things can get expensive. 
[00:11:00]  Now, if you want a taste of how dumb these two women are, I'm going to go straight to track five.  Minutes, minutes after Marion is upset at Opie for not only making her use the N-word the last time she was in, but bringing it up today.  Minutes after this happened.  She and her friend are now singing at the top of their lungs in pure happiness.  Let's play the track.  New York, New York, I want to wake up in a city that doesn't sleep and find I'm kid number one. 
[00:11:30]  A number one of the least, list, A number one.  Hey, shit, big town, boo.  There you go. 
[00:12:00]  I'm melting away, unlike hounds.  I am going to make a brand new start of it.  New York, New York.  In old New York.  Holy shit, how do you not know this song?  And if I can't make it there, I'll scratch my pubic hair. 
[00:12:30]  That's what Lady Di does.  To you, New York.  New York.  New York.  Yeah.  Sing it.  New York.  New York.  Breaking, yeah.  New York.  And the Yankees win the World Series.  What are you talking about, Lady Di?  I think Marion, though, has one of the best excited, yeah, shouts in all of radio. 
[00:13:00]  I don't think anybody could touch it.  I mean, with that level of excitement and the rasp that comes out of it, I think it works every time.  They pluralize sleep.  What do you mean?  They said in a city that never sleeps.  Andrew in New Jersey.  Hey, what's up, Sam?  One of the funniest things is that Marion is, like, so high and mighty.  She thinks she's so much better than a lady Di. 
[00:13:30]  All she does is put her down.  She's like, she drinks too much.  She doesn't have a job.  She doesn't go for a walk.  I go to the gym.  They're supposed to be best friends.  And for some of the newer listeners, they were sweeping floors at Budweiser.  It's not like they were the CEOs of a company.  That's why they're called the retarded Laverne and Shirley, because they were sweeping floors at this Budweiser plant.  But, yeah, it is great that that dynamic exists, that Marion truly thinks that she has her shit.  This woman that just a minute ago was whispering off mic about the N-word, then five minutes later is singing New York, New York, 
[00:14:00]  in easily the worst rendition that's ever been sung of that song.  She thinks that she has all her shit together, and the lady Di really needs to figure some stuff out.  Well, one's an alcoholic, and one's a functional alcoholic.  That's what it is.  Thanks, Andrew.  Matt in Lanes Mill, North Carolina.  What's up?  What's up, Prom Tom?  How you doing?  Hey, buddy. 
[00:14:30]  I was just simply wanting to, all I want to know is, what is a Natty Ice?  Well, we talk about it with Lady Di a lot.  Natty Ice is Lady Di's beer brand of choice.  It's Natural Ice is the full name of it.  And it's something, it's a very inexpensive brand of beer that is usually, college students drink it, ironically.  It's right up there with Pabst Blue Ribbon.  Oh, it's like 6%?  Yeah.  Power-powered beer?  Something like that.  Oh, okay.  Thanks, Matt.  Have a good day, dude. 
[00:15:00]  But yeah, but she drinks them like they're going out of style.  We'll talk to her at 9.30 in the morning, and she's 6 deep.  Let's go to Snowy in Michigan.  What's up, Snowy?  Sammy the Brain Roberts, shit stirs supreme.  How you doing today, sir?  Good, buddy.  How are you?  You know what cracked me after that singing rendition or a couple other times in the past  when people were singing in the studios?  Anthony's kind of like, ugh, ugh, in the background here, like, ugh.  And he's just awing and trying to correct their lyrics.  I've never heard two get, like, they love the song, and every lyric was wrong. 
[00:15:30]  They had to be corrected every lyric.  I just love Anthony's reaction to hear in the background, ugh.  Well, it's true, it's true disgust.  Exactly.  Thank you, Snowy.  It is.  It's true, complete disgust.  Now, only 15 minutes to go until the Opie and Anthony show begins.  Of course, I'm sure we're going to get into, uh, Woody Allen put out a big, uh, press release  in the New York Times.  He wrote an op-ed, I guess.  And he explained his position on the accusations of child molestation against him. 
[00:16:00]  And said that that op-ed piece would be the last time that he ever speaks about it.  I mean, I don't think that ever works.  When somebody's got something that they can't necessarily prove, like, he may get dragged  into court, at which point he can't sit on a witness stand and say, you can read my op-ed  piece if you have any questions.  But I made it clear that that was my last time I'd be talking about this.  Of course, also the Olympics.  I know the guys were watching all weekend.  Opie was doing a whole bunch of live tweeting. 
[00:16:30]  We had our own, speaking of games, the Olympic games, and perverts, potentially Woody Allen,  the accused.  I don't know that he's guilty.  But we had our own perverted games that were going on here on Friday's Super Show.  Let's move all the way down, uh, E-Rock to track 10.  We brought, not only, you know, the Super Show traditionally is all our weirdos, our knuckleheads,  come in and, uh, and all interact together. 
[00:17:00]  Now, this time, we added in penthouse girls.  The hottest penthouse girls that we could find, and they certainly did not disappoint.  One of the games that we played with them was Twister.  The three girls had to compete in a game of thong-twister against Bobo, who was wearing  European Cup bikini briefs.  Really grotesque.  Um, what we didn't realize was, you know how, like, Fear Factor has a thing where you have 
[00:17:30]  to untie a knot?  But the twist on it is you're going to be covered with worms while you're untying a knot.  Even us at the Opie and Anthony Show, the creative geniuses that we are, did not realize  the twist that would come in this game of stripper-twister, which was Bobo's rancid  asshole smell.  We forgot that he doesn't wash his ass.  And so while everybody was crushed together on that twister board, they'd all have to  also survive the smell of Bobo's ass.  Uh, here's how the twister game went on Friday. 
[00:18:00]  Right hand red.  Oh my god.  Bobo, Bobo didn't have a hard-on for days.  Bobo's blocking everybody.  It's amazing.  And for those of you playing at home, Bobo is bent over and his ass reeks today.  Bobo.  Oh, no.  Jesus.  Did you take a shower?  Mary Jean's out.  Mary Jean's out.  Mary Jean's out.  Wait, why is she out?  She looks disgusted.  Oh my god.  Bobo, I would personally bring you some nice stuff and shower-y myself. 
[00:18:30]  Wow.  Wow.  She's flabbergasted from the stench.  I mean, I'm not from Bobo's ass.  Go, girl.  Wow.  Can you ladies smell Bobo from where you are?  I'm sorry.  Wait, how?  Does anybody have white?  Ask her what it smells like.  She said it smells like an old kimchi pot.  It smelled like, uh, the pin.  Hold on, Rich, Rich.  Hold on, hold on.  What does it smell like?  Like a dirty asshole.  Oh, it smells like Rich.  It smells like a dirty asshole. 
[00:19:00]  I was literally gagging.  Rich has to clean this asshole in the business.  Bobo, come on.  She was gagging.  Wow.  It's 2014.  She was gagging, and she never gags.  Believe me.  That was Mary Jean from Penthouse who said, Bobo, come on.  It's 2014.  Like, washing your asshole is something that's improved with technology.  Like, they weren't in 1914 expected to wash their assholes.  But Bobo is, of course, Bobo, and he'll do that every time.  I loved if you were listening closely, you could also hear Marion, who, of course, Lady 
[00:19:30]  Diane Marion stayed for the whole show.  And Marion thinks that she's just one of the guys just sitting there, oh, I'm going to  comment on this, too, yelling at Bobo, didn't you take a shower?  Like, obviously not, Marion.  Why would you even bring it up?  This happened.  The Twister game happened right after Bobo had just completely creeped out the girls.  Now, the great thing about Penthouse girls being in studio on days like this is that part of 
[00:20:00]  their business is not to be grossed out by weird dudes, right?  So no matter how creepy the guy is that comes to them, they want to keep them as a fan because  their whole business is making sure guys want to jerk off to them.  And if weirdos think that they don't like them, they're going to stop jerking off to  them.  So they have to be nice to people like Bobo.  You heard that they were just fed up with Bobo.  In that clip, in that Twister clip, they just had enough.  That's because right before Twister, Bobo had been creeping out the girls. 
[00:20:30]  Let's play track nine as Bobo, fully erect, explains to the girls how he feels about  them.  There's not one smile on the penthouse girls' faces.  Oh, my God.  They're horrible.  You are completely disgusted by this whole thing.  Do you love it?  You're an amazing artist.  I've seen some of your stuff.  Who's an amazing artist?  An amazing artist?  Who's an amazing artist?  It's Picasso and Rembrandt. 
[00:21:00]  He has sides to her that people don't know about.  Wow.  She's an actual person.  She's got...  She's an actual person.  We didn't know that.  Thanks.  She's not just a poor son.  You are really...  She's not just a what?  Bobo, I think you should put your hands in your pants while you're talking to me.  You would like to have a lot better.  No.  Come on.  Come on.  Let him enjoy the moment at least.  Jesus.  Sam, what do we got?  What are we doing now?  Well...  Oh, I'm sorry.  I apologize.  What happened?  Are you enjoying this at all?  I don't have enough caffeine in me. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, sorry.  I'm sorry.  That's true.  Get this girl a cup of coffee, for the love of God.  Wow.  She's very attractive, though.  Were you impressed how easy it went up and down?  She has such a bunch of terror, and that's not a turn-on.  I'm sorry.  No, no.  And that's coming from an Asian girl.  I know.  Voss, for some reason, decided that Jade Vixen was up here, and Voss decided, Rich Voss was  in studio to point out that she's Asian every single chance that he got that day. 
[00:22:00]  There were more Asian jokes coming out of that guy's mouth than I've ever seen come  out of anybody's mouth, but you could tell in Jade Vixen's voice right there that she  was trying to blame it on caffeine.  She was trying to blame it on anything, but she was just angry that she had to sit there  and watch Bobo do what he does.  Voss was on fire.  I will say this.  You know, he made a lot of Asian jokes, but him and Bonnie, I don't know.  To me, I was talking to my wife about this over the weekend. 
[00:22:30]  I feel like Voss and Bonnie are like the new Stiller and Mira.  Like, they're this amazing...  Don't you see that?  Like, they have this amazing back and forth with each other, except if Stiller and Mira  talked about dicks and vaginas.  That would be the difference.  Listen to this part.  Track 11.  Again, Voss and Bonnie would take these moments almost as if it was a routine, but it's not  because it works.  It was perfectly natural with what was going on. 
[00:23:00]  They talked about Bonnie's pussy, actually.  Let's go to track 11.  For me, when I have sex with my husband, I have to, like, use my weight in lube.  Let me tell you.  Did you say you would be that?  It would be easier to fuck a catcher's mitt.  Okay?  It's more moist.  All right?  I have to put her pussy with a softball and tie it up and put it under my mattress to break  it in for a month.  You got to hold her ass in one hand and punch her pussy, walk around the house. 
[00:23:30]  Listen to that back and forth.  Take out the fact that they're talking about how dry Bonnie's pussy is for a second.  And that's almost vaudevillian.  Bonnie comes in with something about how dry her pussy is.  Voss comes back with something.  It's honeymooners.  It is.  It's very honeymooners.  Why you?  You and that dry cunt of yours. 
[00:24:00]  It's really an amazing thing.  Let's go to line one.  And Thomas in Texas.  What's up, Tom?  Sam Roberts.  Good morning.  Good morning.  I know Anthony mentioned Friday that he heard a new Scorch Clips.  Yes.  I mean, look, I don't know if we're going to have time to get into Scorch today.  Scorch, I think, is going to make a return to the Opie and Anthony show.  However, I do believe – I mean, I don't know if we'll get into it today because we got 
[00:24:30]  the Olympics to get through.  We got the Woody Allen thing to get through.  Of course, everything that came off of the Super Show and 90 Day Fiance was on last night.  And we have a whole new episode.  We got tons of clips from the new episode.  And if you – it's been great watching 90 Day Fiance.  It's become such a big part of the Opie and Anthony show.  And the storylines that are going on with this show are amazing.  Russ and Pal, who we had on the show last week, which was amazing, are starting to take 
[00:25:00]  a back seat.  And, I mean, wait until you hear the clips we have for you today.  Wait until you hear the clips.  We only have five minutes before the Opie and Anthony show begins.  And we were talking about the games that we were playing on Friday.  We had a whole set of games.  It was like an Olympics, but for strippers and mentally challenged people.  I don't know if they're actually mentally challenged, but they are very stupid.  We had a lap dance competition with Patty.  She was supposed to take three lap dances. 
[00:25:30]  She could not because of her arthritis acting up.  Let's go to track 12 from Friday.  Oh, Patty.  Patty, relax.  Jesus Christ.  I heard that before.  I wish I was Dr. Skadobo.  Christ.  Come out.  Come out.  Oh, my God.  It's like trying to move an old person.  I don't know, right?  It's like she's trying to get her out of the top.  It's like a dead body. 
[00:26:00]  What's the matter?  She's scared of the titties.  I have arthritis of the neck.  Her arthritis.  Keeping her from enjoying a lap dance.  Be careful.  I have arthritis of the neck.  How did she get arthritis of the neck?  Patty.  Mary Jean is disappointed in Patty.  Yeah.  She's not happy.  So is Patty's family.  I have to say, that might have been my line of the day.  I have arthritis of the neck. 
[00:26:30]  That's like a Saul Rosenberg line.  That's her real life.  That is her real.  That's Stark of Patty's real life.  Let's go to Jeff in North Dakota.  What's up, Jeff?  Sammy, love you guys.  Love you, buddy.  Hey, on Red Eye over the weekend, they were talking about an all-girls college.  They had a statue.  And it looked like Jim Norton.  They were making fun of that.  You've got to look that up.  Oh, did the statue look like Norton?  Yeah, it was on Red Eye.  All right. 
[00:27:00]  We'll look it up.  Maybe we'll get to it today.  Real quick.  We were talking about Voss and Bonnie.  It's always fun when show elements that have been part of the Opie and Anthony show get shown to new people.  Like whether it's Sandy Cain's Twotto being shown to Taylor at the last show or Bobo's dick.  Something that we've all seen.  Something that we as listeners are used to hearing on the air.  When that can be shown to somebody new and we can get that fresh reaction after years, it's beautiful. 
[00:27:30]  Especially when it's a female, when we're talking about Bobo's dick.  Rich Voss' wife, great comedian herself, Bonnie McFarlane, got to see Bobo's dick for the very first time on Friday.  A highlight of the Opie and Anthony Super Show.  Let's take a listen to Bonnie seeing Bobo's dick for the very first time.  Bobo, stand up.  Bobo, wait.  Why do you get a heart on it?  I was thinking about the girls. 
[00:28:00]  It's like, why do you get a heart on it?  Because I was talking about the girls.  No, he goes, I was thinking about the girls.  Oh, I was thinking about the girls.  Bobo's packing.  What the fuck?  I don't know.  No, he's not.  You want to see his dick?  No, I don't want to see his dick.  Bobo, Rich wants to see your dick.  You got to show Rich your dick.  Turn around and show you.  You got it.  For the show.  For the show.  Bonnie, do you want to see Bobo's penis?  No.  Bonnie, please.  I just love it.  I thought it was terrible.  Bonnie, sometimes you got to take one for the team.  Rich, turn around.  Bobo.  Lady Di, move your fucking giant body. 
[00:28:30]  No one can see.  For the love of God.  Don't get so close at night.  Back up, back up.  There you go.  All right, show Bonnie.  Not a Bonnie.  It's like a penis, only smaller.  Fuck me.  It's had 40 operations.  It is functional.  It is functional.  He's trying to sell it.  He's selling.  Bobo, how many operations on your penis?  I'm right with 48.  Because it's a Franken-penis. 
[00:29:00]  Bobo, I'm 48 operations on his penis.  Like after 32, you give up, don't you?  You don't keep going.  All right, it was 48, all right?  I love Bobo.  Yeah, it's still functional.  All right, it is a penis.  It is still functional.  Bonnie sounded like she was being violated.  Those screams of pure terror.  And you wonder what her husband was doing to try to protect her.  He was vomiting.  He was dry heaving the whole time.  Holy shit, was that a great show. 
[00:29:30]  Friday, a super show.  We got another big week of radio planned for you here on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I mean, the Olympic stories don't stop from the one ring not lighting up at the opening ceremonies  to the American bobsledder who had to break down his bathroom door.  He had to break the door down to get out of it so he could get back on the bobsled.  It's like cool runnings.  We got a lot to get into today on the Opie and Anthony Show.  All the Olympic stuff. 
[00:30:00]  Fallout from the Opie and Anthony Super Show on Friday.  And there's a lot of fallout.  I mean, we've only brushed the surface of the behind-the-scenes stories that were going on with that show on Friday.  And, of course, a brand-new episode of 90 Day Fiance that we're going to get into.  The show only gets better.  It's not jumping the shark anytime soon.  And it's going to do a full, strong season.  Woody Allen in the New York Times.  All that and a whole lot more. 
[00:30:30]  Jim Norton is on his way.  Opie and Anthony are in the studio.  As is Travis.  I don't know what he's doing.  But we're all about to find out.  Because the Opie and Anthony Show starts right now.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  I don't know what he's doing.  Thank you.

[00:31:30]  Thank you. 
[00:32:00]  Thank you. 
[00:32:30]  Thank you. 
[00:33:00]  Thank you. 
[00:33:30]  Thank you. 
[00:34:00]  Thank you. 
[00:34:30]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you. 
[00:35:00]  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  right now can i please put my dick in your donuts and through fines scandals suspensions  cancellations and terminations it's the one show that remains unscathed striking fear into the 
[00:35:30]  hearts of management everywhere comes a radio show that after 20 years remains above all else  real this is the opie and anthony show but enough of this palaver let's get the show on the road  ah good morning everyone there it is curling is that what you meant by there it is there it is 
[00:36:00]  curling is on msnbc right now i think that's msnbc doing it it is okay i don't know where to go to  fucking watch the olympics what happens they take morning joe off uh for curling oh it's on usa  oh okay this is on usa you know is it yeah oh i think i don't know it's definitely definitely usa  okay uh curling is terrific you don't know where to find it you like search the channel you're like 
[00:36:30]  what the fuck is anything i think there's only 20 people in the world that know how to sweep properly  so yeah so if you and i or anyone else out there were if we were curling we wouldn't need the  sweeping part no because that wouldn't make any difference whatsoever it would just be shuffle  ball uh shuffle board on ice why you think that that sweeping thing uh they sweep to move at what  a few inches a couple feet whatever you you can't do that there's no way you would be able to do that 
[00:37:00]  moving it or slowing it uh depending depending on what they need to do they either push like ice  shavings in front of the the stone yes or they uh make it nice and smooth so it goes a little  faster they could curve it they can make it turn a little bit we can't do that no i hear there's  like clubs on on long island staten island but if you went there if they gave you one of those brooms  it'd be a waste of time you wouldn't actually be doing anything significant you'd be lucky if you  could even get the thing straight down the ice what are they doing training to be wives are they 
[00:37:30]  turning are they turning it uh it looks like they're turning it there yeah trying to get it  in the bullseye yeah and wow oh man and then the other people would get their turn that's sweeping  after a while yeah they try to screw it up and make it faster so it goes out of the bullseye right  oh thrilling you watching the olympics there anthony i was watching uh the opening ceremonies of course  right uh that was a biggie i guess they killed that guy because he didn't do the ring properly 
[00:38:00]  when that fucking last ring didn't open that's all i was thinking oh some poor bastard all the uh  websites are finally saying look that's a rumor they didn't kill the guy get him in his it was so  ridiculous it's like if no one read that article that came out because an article came out right  apparently one of the rings didn't open on the big light up or whatever the fuck it was supposed to do  what was supposed to open up right because they look they were like little kind of uh small rings  and then they open up into big rings dramatically yeah one didn't open up no so uh yeah everybody 
[00:38:30]  was goofing around that it's russia you know so they killed his family and kill him uh and then an  article came out but it's in a satirical website right and if you read it it says like the the russian  chief of police said he thinks it was an accident he fell on 36 knives right or something it is  obviously if you read it but a lot of people bought into it and thought that they actually  killed someone because that last ring didn't uh open up or whatever yeah they're like who didn't 
[00:39:00]  see this coming and then they post the post the article willy-nilly and then they had explained that  the guy's okay or whoever was responsible didn't get killed yeah the olympics i don't know i i guess  i would assume nbc's getting really good ratings but yeah it's i i don't know what they're supposed to  do but that that primetime coverage is so stupid i was i watched the opening last night and it was  all about bode miller and whether or not he's gonna win you know win gold 
[00:39:30]  win gold in the uh downhill yeah and i i'm sitting there like they have this huge opening piece about  bode miller and will he do it no and at that point everyone knew he didn't oh man i got a dvr'd  there wasn't a person alive yeah that didn't know that it's i don't know i don't know how they  could do it better because they want that one big number i guess yeah instead of having coverage  throughout the day when it is live and shit is happening right now but when they're not going 
[00:40:00]  to really show it until tonight yeah and between twitter and just just living your life it's it's  impossible to avoid this shit they have to uh put their production pieces together that wrap  around and then they they edit some of the shit yeah down uh i get i bet they love the fact that  they have not a nine hour lead time on on a lot of this oh they could really make it all nice yeah  but i mean but but i'd rather what's the demo that doesn't know it's got to be over over 60 years old  the old people that don't have fucking i have my jitterbug phone nothing comes in about the olympics 
[00:40:30]  on my jitterbug but but you can't even say the old people anymore because they're jumping on  they're jumping on facebook yeah yeah they're starting their stupid little facebook pages  i'm on the facebook right look at my kids pictures of my grandchildren aren't they lovely yes iraq comment  one of the things they're doing with uh having all this lead time is they edit out other people's runs  and competitions if it doesn't affect the americans at all oh and if it does they'll they'll they'll focus 
[00:41:00]  it and there's like a million shots but if somebody screws up and the americans say qualify or win a  medal they cut off the run they just go right to them standing around talking about oh he's got a  bronze right you miss some of the competition if it doesn't uh yeah you apply when i see that i don't  need to just see americans i like to see everybody else i like to see those whack job athletes from  those warm countries why are they there trying to figure it out and i want to see them competing  because it's got to be ridiculous yeah yeah i want to see that right i was i was some of the warm 
[00:41:30]  nations and one guy's like 55 years old like what are you doing is like the oldest  olympian ever or something well when you saw the parade of the uh countries coming out there's  one guy right it's just one guy he's with like three or four of his handlers and stuff yeah but  one guy from staten island but uh representing yeah in the caribbean what i want to see him  what did nbc edit out didn't they edit something from the opening ceremony too that people criticized  about tolerance or something i don't know the guy speaking said something about tolerance and nbc 
[00:42:00]  edited it with the rest of the world didn't really oh really do you know what that is  something about the gay uh yeah it was it was just basically what you said it was about you know  tolerance and and we're here and we're all olympians and we're all tolerant people no one wants to hear  your politics it was like the president of the ioc why would nbc edit him and no one else did it was  a bit well nbc's the only channel that's been around the world didn't they not edit it i think most  places saw it live yeah nbc aired it in prime time and it was a big chunk of his speech but you know 
[00:42:30]  they probably edited the wrong thing wow whatever and russia in on russian television too they uh  they went with a rehearsal version of the olympic rings so they did show it oh really they put that  in but the rest of the world saw the mistake yes and the rest of the world saw them fuck up  saw the fuck up i get i guess the gays are gonna be all right over there too the gays believe me i think  after watching the hot air watching the skating the ice dancing no after watching johnny weir 
[00:43:00]  johnny weir if i was an olympian and i was a bit mysterious i would just keep checking on johnny  weir if johnny weir was still alive i know i'm all right i think i'm okay if they didn't kick him  out of the country or take him up into the mountain somewhere never to be seen again johnny weir and  tara lipinski oh my god i'm fucking loving tara lipinski yeah yeah apparently she's doing something  maxim she's pretty hot i got some fucking uh how old is she aptly clad maxim shots you see these  olympian broads and you think oh she was in the last olympics but then if you do your research you 
[00:43:30]  find out it was like 12 years ago or something yeah what was tara lipinski in the olympics she was a  little uh yeah she was like 15 a little figure skater back then uh now she's doing the commentary with  uh johnny weir yeah johnny weir get johnny weir i said look at the tara lipinski she looks better  with the olympic coverage kind of a weird picture but yeah she was always a cute little pixie thing  johnny weir was here once and we were on break and i there was a bunch of us that went into the bathroom 
[00:44:00]  with him yeah i swear to god he was ahead of me i thought a woman was going into the men's room  he had high heels on and a fur coat dude they tamed him down i think they did tamed him down for the  olympics absolutely i was thinking the same goddamn thing i think they said look we got to look at your  your wardrobe you are just too mysterious right but as long as he's all right i think uh i think  the gays in russia will be fine yeah yeah look he's not that guy they have him like as just some dude 
[00:44:30]  right dressed up uh doing the commentary but man like when he's skating he's got a lot of flair a  lot of flair with his johnny weir oh yeah a lot of flair johnny weir i was watching a little of uh  the women's uh short program figure skating the foot figure skating i can almost deal with the women  almost just the women but i can't deal with the fucking men i can't deal with the pairs let's see  the pairs did you see oh god i don't see the ice dancing you see the ice dancing with the brother 
[00:45:00]  sister combo no i didn't see it there's a brother sister combo from staten island creepy they're  representing japan or something i don't know i don't know what how it should be allowed they're  living staten island and they have to like do all that they were doing the tango and shit which is  very romantic yes and his brother sister is creepy as fuck to watch how's that about i don't know but  anyway you're watching the short program oh yeah i was watching the short program uh we got uh 
[00:45:30]  we got uh one of those girls she's a very statuesque blonde yeah she had the ponytail she looked good  yeah i can't remember her name but that uh russian girl i guess she's a 15 year old she did that shit  it was like i don't know anything about fucking skating right i don't know what the you know where  they scored it looks great and then you'll hear the the commentators go oh she missed that one  it's like well it looked fine to me i don't know but uh you could tell it was fucking perfect right  and um well because she's 15 she doesn't have curves yet i think they can't sit i think the 
[00:46:00]  tits get in the way you can't have big boobies and you can't and you can't have a rump on you  because that slows shit down when you're spinning exactly there's some kind of wind resistance or  something look it up there's never been a big titted figure skater that won anything who is that one  um uh from uh where the hell was she she was a bit kind of a big statuesque girl yeah but she  maybe maybe she's katarina witt oh right did she ever win a medal though i'm not sure i know she had 
[00:46:30]  fucking tits on her she did yeah what year is that how do you remember that i don't know it's  it's not too long ago oh no i bet you it is long 88 that's calgary that's 88 no get the fuck out  what she won two gold medals yeah in 1980 84 and 88 well there goes four and 88 there goes my theory  because she did have the bigger boobies she uh looked pretty goddamn good boobie oh yeah so oh 
[00:47:00]  yeah so what does putin do with figure skating in this country i think he's just in denial  you got well one of them they say he's a rock star really in russia but if if they don't like the gay  maybe it's like maybe he's not gay you just assume all male figure skaters are gay it's probably  is that bad to say no i bet he is is there one straight uh male figure skater name one i i would  like to know i don't know a straight male figures i think there is but not a lot there's one guy but 
[00:47:30]  not a lot yeah okay yeah but i think maybe they're at the point where that we were at with like  liberaci over there they just make like they look and go oh when's he gonna get a nice girl  yeah but for a country that doesn't like the gay they they love you know this one russian figure  skater yeah but maybe he's not benji plushenko yeah plushenko they say he's a rock star yeah he's  like one of the most famous people in russia really yeah well i mean he seems like he he could  be i guess a little mysterious semi-mysterious uh not really but it's the mysterious curious 
[00:48:00]  it's just that he's a figure skater yeah yeah that's enough that's mysterious right there  i i don't know i just don't i don't know whatever that's a cool thing to get into though  there's all chicks it's like taking a yoga class it's all women yeah yeah if you're a straight guy  and you can pull that off why not do it you can be rolling in box i think the thing is if you're  that good at skating and you're a real man's man kind of guy and you're in russia you'll play  fucking hockey you dummy you know you'll be fucking yeah be a rock star on banging it up uh 
[00:48:30]  yeah in a hockey rink in a hockey rink it's that guy i don't know he looks mysterious but he's married  he is married there you go huh with child with child there you know what though it's russia you got  it all take that with like you you will get married now you will have a child right very good  they control your whole life yes because supposedly 85 of the country is not for the gay 
[00:49:00]  no they don't like the gay and they pretty much say what the percentage is 10 yeah is gay so then  it's like 10 and then half your parents are accepting in russia oh man which makes up your 15  percent right i don't know johnny weird jesus christ oh no  is that him oh that is good oh jesus oh god that is a that is some picture of johnny weird 
[00:49:30]  you know someone has to say it i don't think i'll be alive long enough to accept that percentage of  right right to where it's got high heels do look good with the pants there's no denying all right  look is that bad to say you get scared when you say shit now nah like that's fine like i accept gay  sure but i i don't know if i'll ever come around to accept that level of gay yeah is that bad to say 
[00:50:00]  not at all you sure do you mean accepted or because you know this is so over the top that it's like  weird it's really just weird to me do you mean accepted or just be comfortable with it because like  you like you see a guy like that like you don't hate him you just know that's true i'm not talking  about hate no i think uh a better way to put it is to be comfortable around right comfortable  exactly like when i saw him walking into the bathroom with high heels and a fur on i'm like  you're like oh i don't know i'm not there yet yeah not quite that is just a little little too 
[00:50:30]  uncomfortable strange to me i don't it doesn't even faze me and at all it could be because of my  fucking uh behaviors in my life or or because i'm just you see everything the fucking in the  business none of it becomes shocking anymore none of it to me is surprising it's not gonna ruin my  day or anything like that trust me but it's just uh i don't know here's the main test if you have a  son and johnny weir comes home one day and you have these dreams and aspirations for your your kid 
[00:51:00]  and then that level of flamboyant gay guy comes home as his lover that would be now you now you  have to be accepting again you know your kid's a top that's what i think you're like my boy's a top  you're not advocating hate or violence or anything but you're not gonna be comfortable you're not  gonna be happy with it what the fuck that i never knew anyone could even more sexy up the gimp suit 
[00:51:30]  wow he's cut out the nipple parts the breast parts and uh the abs and and his penis and the penis  hole which shows some kind of like uh i don't know it looks like panties on he loves being gay  oh does he love being gay well just over the top like flamboyant over the top if you're going and  yeah so you should if you're going to be gay you should go that route because there's not one dick  you can't get if you're him that's true that's like if you're going to be a muscle guy you might you  got to go the fucking stallone or schwarzenegger route if you're going to be gay go that route 
[00:52:00]  gotta go the whole fucking yeah the full monty did you see the ski jumping uh no i did not see  ski jumping a lot of these sports they're ruining because they're making it like too perfect very  scientific well there's now a track i i don't i don't know how many years they've been doing the  actual track that the skis fit in as you're flying down the ramp oh so you can't do the agony of defeat  really not at all when we grew up man it was just like i don't know there's hopefully there's enough 
[00:52:30]  snow on the ramp as you're going down but it's not even snow they go on it looks like it might even  just be ice really that is frozen does anyone know exactly what that is so you see it though it's the  two tracks and you would think at first that it's uh you know maybe the tracks that the skiers have  kind of formed but it's not right they they put it in there and then every ski jump looks exactly the  same it's a boring sport to watch there you go yeah it is a see the tracks yeah when we were  growing up there were no fucking tracks man you didn't know what the fuck you were gonna hit on 
[00:53:00]  the way down i think after a while in the old days the tracks would kind of form sure but they  were the natural occurrence of that i guess but that made it more of a sport too because then you  as a jumper had to figure that shit out like all right i gotta stay in the track to get my speed  up but now they don't even have to worry about any of that shit what the fuck is that i didn't know  that yeah i don't know and they take off and it's two grooves for your skis basically and  would it be unfair to certain to skiers depending on when you went like with the track change i'm 
[00:53:30]  sure but the old days that's just how it was you know yeah yeah that's why qualifying is so  important right yeah and then you get one guy that falls every hundred jumps not a lot they had  it on for about an hour yesterday afternoon i was bored shitless man every jump looked exactly the same  to me you could tell they went a little further by the lines when they hit but it's like who gives  a fuck there was one year and it might have been calgary i'm not sure it might have been the 88  uh where there was a wind problem right and they really didn't notice it but one after another every 
[00:54:00]  skier was falling wow in horrific fashion too it was everyone bam one after another after another just  falling it was one of the most entertaining ski jumping sessions to watch i can't imagine someone's  actually watching that coverage going wow that was a terrific jump yeah yeah i think most of us  watch the ski jump because you want to see some kind of fucking agony of defeat it is amazing when  they first take off you're like no instantly like oh that guy's got some air yeah he's gonna go and 
[00:54:30]  then it's so odd when they're coming down and they're over the right the ground and they're still  going right like what's fucking make a little airfoil out of themselves i don't know that the first year  they're doing it it's pretty cool i don't think so i'd never even heard of that i think they've  used the tracks for a while now yeah i would love to know why i guess to make it more fair for for  everybody but i think that would be part of the the sport yeah you figure it out on the way down  try to get a nice group going you know it's really good that fucking uh cross-country skiing i was 
[00:55:00]  watching that what holy shit i think we all make believe that we like the winter olympics to be honest  with you there's a few because like events that are okay but like the luge is another one i don't  get you work your balls off and and you can lose a medal by what a quarter of a second that's  ridiculous yeah i don't know it's the white people olympics huh it's the white people olympics that is  that's true that's what it is it's the white people olympics that's right welcome to the we can 
[00:55:30]  still do it olympics the jamaicans are part of it well yeah but you know that's kind of as a goof  it's like when you watch in the summer olympics and you're watching like the track you know where  they have to run and you see some white people in there you're like oh just stop it kenyans winning  yeah yeah placeholders that's what they are they're like the other sweat hogs that were in the class  welcome back cotter just fill up the room but what events are really that exciting  downhill yeah some of the snowboarding is kind of cool i guess that shit you're um 
[00:56:00]  the illusion the bobsled for a little bit yeah i guess i don't mind the ski jumping either  that's kind of cool really yeah every jump just seemed exactly the same there's no variance to  it at all and then i gotta say as faggy as it is that women's uh skating thing the figure skating and  that i think is you know because they're that's the number one that's thrown in yeah and the people  love that one yeah i think that's the summer olympic equivalent to um the like women's gymnastics 
[00:56:30]  thing and the moguls moguls that just looks painful i did a lot of skiing and i did some  moguls it's not even close to fun it fucking hurts a lot it looks even when you're a lot younger your  knees are just like what the fuck am i doing what's a mogul those are the big fucking bumps  that's like bumps they're skiing on it and you just see their legs going because there's bumps just  look at their knees and just imagine what that's doing crazy i think a lot of these guys have a tough 
[00:57:00]  time walking uh properly when you get older i think i heard one of the commentators say that  they're usually done by 24 25 yeah when uh doing that event it's done yeah your knees just fucking  can't take that show show show jimmy the moguls like why are they there is that just is that just  part of the just uh just another event you know they're like okay we we need more skiing events  let's make big huge fucking bumps you guys ski real fast over bumps it's brutal to watch yeah  because you just imagine your own fucking knees going through that punishment 
[00:57:30]  moguls this isn't this year's but this is an example of uh that's like some freestyle mogul shit  so brian wilson taking on the steep slope covered in a rush of bumps or moguls and two big jumps  yeah but this is like freestyle with everything that was a good one  look at the knees look at the knees  look how steady his head is though right wow it's really amazing wait i'm every every bump is one 
[00:58:00]  time i would have fallen  it's horrible but he lands right before another bump imagine if you land on a bump how bad you  fuck your leg up that would hurt and trust me when i was doing moguls i didn't come close to doing  that but it still fucking hurt a lot that's gotta uh really eat the knees up yeah uh something else  with the olympics oh the opening ceremony i want to talk about the uh the russians and how they  handled the whole uh opening ceremony a lot of uh a lot of russian history thrown in there nice some 
[00:58:30]  left out i don't remember seeing stalin at all and the millions of people he killed that wasn't really  represented for time they shortened it they shortened it for time you don't understand why they didn't  add that to i know to their opening ceremonies they did this piece where it was like pretty much the  the russian history and they showed you know from when there were people coming over in boats and  yeah building shit and it was all the way up to modern times where they show people building 
[00:59:00]  giant skyscrapers and stuff and it was a filmed piece and it was probably 10 minutes long  and uh there wasn't one black person in it i was watching just going wow in america they would  just have regardless if there were or not they would just have to make it very diverse you know  there'd be a black guy an asian guy this that russians it was like all fucking just attractive  white people well they do it by height in russia because all there are is white people so if they 
[00:59:30]  if they only had five nine people all the five sixers complained  it was a lot of opera a lot of ballet uh not uh i didn't i don't remember seeing any hip-hop  happening in the opening ceremony no what about the uh the biathlon i think it's called is that  the one where they shoot the ski and shoot but i mean it's probably hacked to even talk about it  because everyone has over the years but how was that sport even invented i guess it's something 
[01:00:00]  of tradition based on someone going out and hunting you're cross-country skiing and then you stop and  shoot that's such a weird combination of things i think it is based on like someone going out on  their skis with a gun to hunt right and you know yeah but we did the bit a lot of olympic events they  got rid of because they they finally looked completely ridiculous silly maybe we can do that list  again today yeah yeah like look up uh um uh winter olympic sports they got rid of or events 
[01:00:30]  yeah because i know they're like in the summer games there was one where you just like try to go as  far down as possible in the water and they finally said okay yeah they had to put the kai  can't do this anymore but the list the list of events is usually pretty good to check out but that  seems like one that doesn't really i don't know it just doesn't make sense anymore i don't know  yeah it is a little it's strange to watch because it's two weird things to put together 
[01:01:00]  like you could either shoot or you could ski right it's like you do both right no  make an event of it miller in toronto tell opie to make ski jumping exciting make them wear a wing  suit move that would that would rule oh yeah fly a little more holy fuck that would roll yeah right  or make the the actual jump even higher oh man it needs something but you said you liked it so  i kind of think it's cool you know there's a lot of little subtleties that keep get them to go 
[01:01:30]  further right and to see them trying to work their body like shape it like an airfoil right get the  skis up to catch the air right i don't know it's kind of interesting for five minutes that'll work  let's say hi to chris in staten island chris chris good morning boys how are you all right  uh i realize the only uh the only reason worth watching uh the women's hockey team uh if you  check out the goaltender for the russian team she's absolutely phenomenal there are some women  athletes here in the winter olympics pretty hot that are fucking stunning yes and uh let's see this 
[01:02:00]  uh what russian women's hockey goalie i actually don't mind the women's hockey wow yeah i don't mind it  all about that i'm a big hockey fan in in general so someone had a great tweet it was talking about  the commentary that was going on women's hockey and they're like the women are uh actually using uh  using the boards a lot to advance the puck into and then the guy goes this guy's full of shit  he goes they're just missing the passes they just miss the passes and the puck hits the boards and 
[01:02:30]  bounces they're really using those boards they have better skills than that come on and fucking  they can't they can't get the passes wow this is this is how she looks when she takes her pads off  holy holy shit oh my god get the fuck out of here that's the russian goalie huh wow my god that is uh  wow is there one site that shows all the hot uh olympians the hot broad who i got quite billy smith

[01:03:30]  from her this is the uh 20 hottest female athletes in the winter olympics uh sarah hendrickson  sarah she's all right she's she kind of looks like a girl next door she's just all right yeah  a girl next door i mean you gotta you gotta like look at these women and think you know throw 10 years  on them because youth youth makes women all look pretty good now in general that does seem to be  the rule of thumb she's just all right she's got youth wow i can't see what we got here yes what 
[01:04:00]  torrent bright what have we got here what does she do uh snowboarder oh god damn wow that's all right  she's a stunner yes all right 18 ashley wagner she looks like hillary clinton in that picture  jesus the fuck she looked better she yeah she looked uh that's a bad picture her mouth is open  her eyes are open real wide because you know your figure skaters she looks pretty good yes i saw her

[01:08:30]  to uh be so provocative yeah isn't it sad that this is how the females have to get attention  in the olympics they've been working their balls off their entire lives this is what they gotta do  they gotta be nude for us to pay attention lolo get naked lolo jones who's so needy that she decided  she's got to be a bobsledder now really she's from the summer olympics she's a sprinter oh what  does she do the hurdles or something and she failed in the summer olympics so now she's like  fuck i need more attention so now she's a bobsledder in the winter olympics who is number one 
[01:09:00]  uh rebecca tor yeah she's all right too yeah another blonde nice you do get a bunch of them  ski bunnies you know blonde tall hot fucking hot nice oh and we got a story of the olympic  bobsledder yeah yeah so this was this was true oh yeah i saw the hole in the door and i thought okay  someone's having fun with the fact that so she has some problems but it seems like they don't 
[01:09:30]  really have any problems by the way yeah it seems like the accommodations for maybe the who gives the  fucks yeah but it looks like the athletes and everyone that matters at the actual olympics are  are well taken care of they're doing all right but some of the fucking journalists and and the family  members maybe are dealing some shit but this clip made it seem like to all the olympians have been told  not to say anything negative about the country the accommodations or anything until you're out  yeah yeah until they let you out i don't know what's gonna happen because they might not all right 
[01:10:00]  just keep you there do they know there's a website for all the women olympians in russia in lingerie  well we do not know that ralph is it busy lingerie i hate busy lingerie ralph what's up  hey uh they they just made a big stink about on uh the internet last night about how they they  think they're degrading all the russian women because they have them on some website right now  where they're uh all in lingerie all the russian olympians all right well where is that site uh 
[01:10:30]  i've seen on i'll be i've seen on yahoo last night they were talking about it it was like one of their  headline things like they're degrading the russian women okay degrading yahoo featured it of course yes  because yahoo needed some clicks damn yeah it's some russian name it's like oh my god jesus christ  look at this broad wow what sport is this she's like fucking zena oh my god damn uh we're on yahoo uh 
[01:11:00]  and there you go oh man a lot of uh russian athletes in uh sensible lingerie not busy lingerie that's  pretty good thank you sir thanks for the uh thanks yeah thank you ralph in ohio all right so here's a  bobsledder he had a little problem and so she you know we're after the medals and uh let it be known  okay non-sledding question for johnny you tweeted a picture out this morning you had to bust out of  your shower explain that one well it was uh it was an unfortunate situation but got out safely um 
[01:11:30]  you know could have happened to anyone the nice thing is that the venue here has been phenomenal uh  the russians have done a great job with the venue and so uh unfortunately though it was uh i got  locked in this morning yeah that's a great picture look it's a conan of barbarian burst there you're  the push man right well we know that now we're a little bit bigger individuals so i had to make  sure the hole's big enough to get out and dallas quickly your first time at the olympics what's  the experience been like so far oh it's just been unbelievable i'm just just honored to be here  i just assumed that was bullshit but now look at the door you can tell he just launched himself 
[01:12:00]  through that right door it's all cardboard it was locked in it's like corrugated cardboard  man that's pretty impressive going through a fucking bathroom door like that right well it's  paper very weak door very cheap door by the way looks badass though it is cool as fuck that he did it  fuck yeah yeah all right we're gonna take a break americans in fucking russian bathrooms i'll tell you 
[01:12:30]  that much probably his first thought too he probably turned the knob once and then broke  the door down yeah that's like it you know he's a big dumb lunkhead and did that and then was like  oh no i broke the door it's a pole yeah oh oh where's eric today he's here he is yeah why  he was dynamite today that was a joke i know he was in here for 20 minutes yeah that was the point  and the reason i said that uh he just gave me the scout shannon audio oh shit out of nowhere on 
[01:13:00]  friday retired what's your guess i was wondering is he sick or is it a thing with him and todd everyone  has to think medical right well with him and todd just going at it and fucking he said if he doesn't  leave i'm leaving remember we we had heard uh through the through the years there's there's been an  issue between those two yeah i don't know if there has been i think uh sam pointed out that uh todd was  constantly putting scott um no mind list yeah he was a pain no mind list he was a permanent resident  of the pain no mind right we could do this whole bit after the break yeah why don't we do it take 
[01:13:30]  some time yes but i i this audio is going to be devastated this good audio is good yeah it's good  it's because you're a lot of undertones you're more of a radio guy than than most so is this is  is this interesting to you or is it going to be interesting to a lot you know the audience as  well the audience is not going to give a shit but to you guys to you guys it'll be interesting  there's a lot of undertones to their conversation yeah all right so we'll make magic i hated the  quote too so i think there's definitely got to be oh you hated the quote that i read the quote from 
[01:14:00]  todd pettengale oh and i thought it was just a typical phony douchey quote oh i'm just giving my  opinion i'm sure then scotty mcquittin show yeah this is todd mc get rid of him  i'm sure they had issues yeah but i think the guy just can't do it anymore he knows that  uh he sucks on the air maybe he knew making a retirement speech was the only way to be taken  off the pain on my eyes for once they listen to him nope wow and then it was not the case  now there's some cuts oh really all right we're gonna get into that next we got a very busy show 
[01:14:30]  because everyone is talking about 90 day fiance episode four was on last night yeah and even our  our own jim norton who hates reality shows is all yeah your own jim norton emailed roland  jonesing for numbers five and six because we have advanced copy i was dying for fucking five i  actually checked the guide last night and realized it was just four yeah i can't wait to get uh uh and i i  want to know what you think of this show now that you've seen all four episodes yeah i love this

[01:27:30]  If your time to you is worth saving  Wow, so the Beatles come to America 50 years ago, and this song was released 50 years ago.  Wow.  This song is 50 years old.  Yes.  Bob Dylan.  I think he saw the times they were a-changin'.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, baby, baby.  Anybody watch the Beatles last night?  That Beatles thing was pretty good.  Yeah.  I thought it was all right. 
[01:28:00]  I watched it.  I enjoyed it.  Who had the best performance?  You know what?  I'm going to say the Eurythmix had a really great performance.  Sweet Dreams are made of these?  Nope.  You're not thinking Sweet Dreams when you see Annie Lennox.  No, huh?  Oh, my God.  Sweet Nightmares.  Oh, no.  She's a beast.  Wow.  I know time's not kind to any of us, but...  That was the 80s.  Wow.  Annie Lennox is a little rough to look at.  I thought Ringo Starr did all right, and I'm not a big Ringo fan. 
[01:28:30]  That's an amazing picture right there.  Huh.  Like, what?  What?  That picture, when you consider...  That was last night?  Yeah.  They look great.  Yeah.  Like, consider it 50 fucking years ago, they're talking about...  Yeah.  Well, you're looking at Ringo.  He's 74.  Wow.  He was born in 1940.  And then Bob McCartney, how old is he again?  71, maybe?  72?  Wow.  Yeah, they looked all right. 
[01:29:00]  They sounded great.  Amazing.  They haven't really lost...  71.  71.  Wow.  Ringo jumps around, and he's not a bad front man, actually.  He jumps around?  Yeah.  At 70 fucking...  Yeah, he was doing jumping jacks and shit.  Amazing.  One of the songs he sang, uh, Boys or something?  Ooh.  But he pulled it off.  It was great.  He had the whole fucking crowd into it.  So...  Where was it done?  Where was it...  I don't know.  I just turned it on, because the Olympics were born the fuck out of me.  They filmed it, like, last week. 
[01:29:30]  Oh.  They filmed it probably right after the Grammys or something, right?  Before the Grammys.  Oh, before the Grammys?  Who came in and overdubbed Ringo's tracks?  Well, Ringo didn't get to play the drums by himself.  Oh.  With Paul.  Oh, again.  Yeah, it was...  Yeah, I think Paul's like, look, I'll play the drums by himself.  I'll play with you, but I'm using my fucking band.  My guy.  You could fill all you want, but we're not plugging in.  Huh?  He's just way better.  But it looked like he knows how to drum still.  Ringo looked like he was doing a little rhythm drumming.  Ringo, keep a beat.  All right.  Nothing wrong with that. 
[01:30:00]  Paul sounded fantastic.  Paul wants some fills in his music.  You got any clips from the Beatles thing?  Maybe we could work on that down the hall, because it's a biggie.  I thought Dave Grohl's performance was really good.  A lot of people watched this last night, so we should have a couple clips.  Yeah, Dave Grohl's an animal.  He's amazing.  He is fucking amazing.  And everyone just loves the guy.  Everyone.  I think he's the only person alive that no one hates.  Everyone loves him.  Oh, of course he loves.  Sorry.  And everyone respects him as a musician, too.  It's like...  Yeah.  No one ever says, oh, Dave Grohl's a fucking piece of shit or a hack or... 
[01:30:30]  Right.  The guy's just a solid fucking rock guy.  Yep.  Yeah, we'll work on Beatles clips for the next break.  Some of the performances, so you can check it out.  Ooh.  Some were all right.  Yeah.  Alicia Keys did all right.  Oh, yeah.  With John Legend.  Did she sit on that fucking piano bench with that giant fat ass on her?  Her ass is spreading.  They're going to run out of fucking piano bench soon, man.  It's crazy.  It is fucking...  That is a big ass.  Big ass.  I guess the brothers like an ass like that.  I wouldn't know what the fuck to do in an ass that big. 
[01:31:00]  It's too much ass.  Wow.  And it's really spreading.  Doggy bags.  It's crazy.  The portions of ass.  Big ass.  Yeah.  And then they kept going to Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon in the audience.  Why?  Stop it.  And Yoko's dancing and having a good old time.  And Sean Lennon, I don't know.  Mysterious?  No.  Oh.  I'm going... 
[01:31:30]  There's got to be some kind of incest thing going on.  Some type of...  He's got mommy issues or something.  Psycho thing going on?  Norman Bates?  I understand he lost a parent when he was like five years old or whatever, but...  You kidding?  What happened?  But he hangs out with mommy way too much.  It's really strange.  Like, they're always seen together everywhere.  Mm-hmm.  You rarely see Sean Lennon by himself.  You'll see Yoko by herself.  Yeah.  But you rarely see Sean Lennon by himself.  It's really fucking creepy.  Who's the one that had the big song?  Huh?  Julian that had the big song? 
[01:32:00]  Oh, yeah.  Julian had a big hit in the 80s.  Sean sounds a lot like John Lennon, but has just gone the kind of...  Avant-garde.  Avant-garde artsy route.  I hate avant-garde.  Unfortunately.  I know.  Avant doesn't need that.  You get it?  Yes.  It's a good one.  No.  The wrong parent, you know, left him because, you know, he's got all his influence from Yoko  and maybe listening to a few Lennon records, but...  Yeah.  But I'll say it every time.  I saw him in Central Park a few years back, and he was... 
[01:32:30]  He sounds amazing.  His voice is just like John Lennon's.  It's creepy.  Man.  But then it was all the, yeah, weird shit going on.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  But you heard the...  You absolutely heard the talent in his voice.  Yeah.  And he absolutely could be a pop star or whatever.  Maybe that has passed him by at this point.  I don't know.  But he certainly could have fucking had some pop songs.  Maybe it's a little too much.  That would have done really well.  Maybe a little too much like...  Maybe he just didn't want to do it that way.  That's, you know, fair enough.  Mm-hmm.  Fair enough, sir. 
[01:33:00]  Fair enough.  So, should we do 90 Day Fiancé?  Yeah, you want to do that?  Yep.  Or the Scott and Shannon.  I'll just squeeze the Scott first.  I'm kind of more curious about Scott.  Are you really?  Yeah.  Scott, yeah.  Well, during our Super Show, Super Show 2 on Friday, which was a huge success, Rich  and Bonnie did great, by the way, Jimmy.  Of course.  They're hilarious.  They did great.  You were right.  Because we weren't sure we wanted anyone in.  And last minute, Jimmy talked us into saying, no, Rich will be great.  And then he brought Bonnie in, and they just fucking killed it on Friday. 
[01:33:30]  Yeah, that show was in fucking sane.  They're the funniest couple.  I can't think of a funnier couple in the country.  They're great.  They both shined.  Can't remember those Canadian serial killers.  Oh, Paul, uh, Carla and Paul, uh, Bernardo.  Yeah, yeah.  But they technically were Canada.  No, uh, yeah, that is true.  And they were better at getting a reality show, actually.  Yes.  Listen, Bonnie, are...  Super Show 2 was great.  Yeah.  We might have to throw that on our podcast soon.  That was fucking... 
[01:34:00]  But, uh...  Balls out.  Fucking great.  We gotta put Super Show 3 on the docket.  On the docket?  I'm thinking April.  Uh, April 1st.  Yeah.  Around there.  That week.  That...  And that's...  That's Lady Di's birthday.  Well, that's all I was thinking.  Oh, God.  Was she a fucking disaster?  It's...  And the pictures, like...  And the things people say on Twitter about the pictures, it's just...  And then she was, like, uh, tweeting Dave Chappelle all weekend.  She had her fucking mind.  The actual Dave Chappelle.  Right.  We had a fake Dave Chappelle. 
[01:34:30]  How did that work out?  Obviously good.  Yeah, better than I thought it would.  Yeah.  Yeah, the guy actually sounds pretty much like Dave Chappelle.  Well, you knew it had.  He kind of looks like him, too.  Yeah, he did.  Dave Chappelle was all cracked out.  We knew it worked out well when, uh, after five minutes...  I left him alone in Troy's studio for five minutes.  And then came back in, because I really wasn't sure it was going to be great.  But when I opened the door, Lady Di had her shirt up and was showing fake Dave Chappelle her tits.  Right when he walks in, there she is. 
[01:35:00]  What?  And there's pictures of that.  Just horrible.  So I just immediately shut the door and, all right, you two kids...  So then all weekend she was tweeting the real Dave Chappelle saying,  I want to talk about what happened on Friday.  Hey, Dave!  Hey, Dave!  Dave Chappelle must have read a few of those tweets like,  What the fuck's going on?  David Slade, he died!  What?  Man, who is this bitch, man?  Man!  I don't know, man!  I don't know her, man.  So, uh, what do you think?  Around April 1st?  Super Show 3?  I don't see why not.  That sounds good. 
[01:35:30]  I mean, we're on the verge of blowing the Super Show concept.  We gotta, like, you know...  We gotta keep the high standards that we have set for ourselves.  Keep coming up with ideas.  Well, with the likes of Lady Di and Marion, it's just...  If you, if we could get Marion, then the Super Show concept will continue for years.  Marion is gold.  I can listen to her all fucking day.  I was talking to Voss and Bonnie after the show about Marion continuously coming over and  she'd, like, put her arm around Bonnie and just laugh, screaming in her ear as if the 
[01:36:00]  two of them were in on some great joke.  Like, it's Voss, Bonnie, and Marion and the rest of these freaks.  Yeah, yeah.  She was, you know...  She was one of the, you know, special guests.  Yeah, look at these crazy people.  Right.  Yeah.  There was a point where Anthony was doing a live read and Marion just walked over to  Opie and just started talking to him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  In the middle of a read.  No concept.  No.  None.  I don't even know what she was saying.  She doesn't know what's going on.  Throughout the show, Lady Di kept yelling at random times, hey, bring Dave Chappelle in 
[01:36:30]  here.  When's Dave Chappelle coming in here?  Is that your Lady Di impression?  I guess.  It's not irritating enough to be Lady Di.  She is just fucking a disaster.  A disaster.  Yeah.  That hair, the face, the body.  Marion's a disaster.  But she starts talking to Lady Di like, you gotta get your life together.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:37:00]  Yeah, she's giving her advice.  At least she works.  But that whole, you know, I've lost so much weight.  It's like, look, no, you haven't.  You're still shaped like a Weeble.  We were listening to a clip on the pre-show today of Lady Di's delayed reaction.  You said something about, Ant said something about Mary and hating black people.  And then Lady Di said, Anthony, we don't hate anybody.  And Ant goes, well, I hate you.  And then five seconds goes by where other people are talking, like it's over. 
[01:37:30]  And all of a sudden, Di jumps back in.  Anthony, you hate me?  Oh, yeah, let's hear it.  Travis has it.  She's such a dog.  Let me hear that.  Marion, by the way, I'm sorry about the nigger thing.  Wow.  What?  What happened?  Oh, shit.  She's waving you off.  She's waving you off.  Don't say that.  Don't say that.  I'm sorry about that.  That was, yeah.  You cool with it?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Shut her off.  She's cool with it.  Play some music.  That never.  What?  What? 
[01:38:00]  Don't take us to break.  Marion, shut her down.  Oh, it shut her right down.  All I want to say is that you got a pass, though, from the DJ Who Kid.  Yeah, you got a pass.  You're good.  You got the card.  You got the, you know, use it any time you want card.  DJ Who Kid, he cans those things out.  Where is Who Kid anyway?  Why did it shut her down?  She's like, mm-hmm.  Wow, we figured out how to get her quiet.  Ixnay on the igger-nay.  Don't want to talk about it?  You look mad. 
[01:38:30]  What?  What happened?  But I just want to apologize.  That was pig Latin, by the way, or as I call it, dilat.  I don't want to talk about it.  What?  I don't want to talk about it.  Oh, shit.  I don't want to talk about it.  Did it, did it, was it trouble?  I bet it was probably trouble, right?  I won't talk about it.  I won't talk about it, but I'm just, I'm just asking you one thing.  Was it, was it trouble?  But everyone knows you're not racist.  Did you get a talking?  Did you get a talking to?  It wasn't about being racist.  You're not a racist.  I know it wasn't, but there were people that looked at it and thought, you know, 
[01:39:00]  thought, you know, what?  But everyone, everyone pulls that race card out of their ass.  Right.  You were just having fun.  And DJ Who Kid said it was cool.  DJ Who Kid was in the video.  If a black guy says it's cool, then we're allowed to say it.  It's fine, then it's fine.  We all know that.  What?  What?  Oh, she works with a lot of men.  Yeah, but they should understand the culture.  Mary, we know you hate those people, but it's okay.  All right. 
[01:39:30]  Anthony.  What happened?  Nobody hates anybody.  Oh, well.  Well.  We hate you.  We're passed.  I just want to apologize.  Oh, okay.  You hate me?  Fucking boob.  What a boob.  A boob.  A boob.  Did she say boob?  Oh, she was saying boobs.  Oh, yeah.  She was saying boobs.  I showed my boob.  I showed my boobs.  She showed her boobs a lot.  Jim, look how sexy it got.  Oh, yeah.  Mike Puschetti. 
[01:40:00]  What is that?  Mike Puschetti and Lady Di sharing them.  Lady Di sharing food.  Sharing a donut.  If you go to O&A Show on Twitter and Instagram, there's a bunch of pictures.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  There's one group shot from the office.  That's just fantastic.  Oh, my God.  Where's this?  O&A Show?  O&A Show on Instagram and Twitter.  Okay, yeah.  There's a ton of fucking pictures from the Super Show, too.  That looks like a floor, like a ward in a mental hospital.  Oh, fuck yeah.  And then E-Rock was in studio taking photos, like always, but they're candid photos, so 
[01:40:30]  people are supposed to kind of ignore him.  Uh-huh.  Every time he would take a photo, you'd just hear Di yelled out, I blinked!  She wanted a redo?  Yeah.  I wouldn't worry about it.  No.  Someone said to her, where has your life gone?  And she went, and I blinked, and here I am.  That was a hell of a show, though, man.  Yeah, it was fun.  We'll do a third one very soon.  Right around April 1st, so.  Just the three best friends. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, cool.  It's a nice picture they have with Philip Seymour Hoffman.  Rest in peace.  She fucking looks like him.  She does.  Look at her fucking head.  Oh, she's just full of life, though.  God bless that.  Oh, God bless her.  She just loves having fun.  We should get a breathalyzer next time for a lady die.  We have that, right?  We'll get one.  Yeah.  Put that down.  That's a good idea.  I'll put it on the docket.  Lady Trucker came up with that one.  So, Scott, out of nowhere, from Scott and Todd, retired on Friday. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah, what happened there?  He's done.  That was it.  He's not on the air today.  Yeah.  And Eric cut up some audio of the big announcement.  Uh-huh.  We didn't have time to do this on Friday, and everyone's talking about it, so.  Oh, I thought you were going somewhere with this.  No.  The Todd Show.  Yeah.  Original, right?  You're right.  You're right.  No.  No.  What's up?  This whole thing is just... 
[01:42:00]  What's wrong?  It's just aggravating.  What?  What?  You'll hear in certain clips, there's someone that just really shows his dickishness.  Oh.  This whole thing.  Well, I read this statement, and it just...  I don't really...  I'm not a Todd fan.  I like Scott more, even though he's annoying.  Wah, wah.  He's a big rock head.  This fucking parody writing jizz bag is the worst.  I can't imagine he's going to do all right.  Yeah, we wish you well, buddy.  I haven't heard it.  Anytime.  We really...  We're going to miss you around here.  It's going to...  We don't know what we're going to do. 
[01:42:30]  I might have to keep doing song parodies.  Oof.  And they have a countdown on their PLJ site.  The Todd Show coming on February 24th.  That's it, huh?  And they have, like...  It's counting down.  It's a new opportunity to try to get something going.  What could he possibly do on his...  Song parodies.  Oh, my God.  That's it.  Hey, look.  This is Scummy McDisloyal.  Scummy McDisloyal? 
[01:43:00]  Hey, this is...  This is Judas McBrutus.  Hey, this is Stabber Back, Cocksucker parody writer.  Oh, Chubba Chubba.  Yeah.  Remember that?  He paved the way, and then I hopped up on the ride and wrote a bunch of song parodies.  Yes.  You've seen my work.  What was your name?  I didn't catch it the first time around.  I'm Vulture McGravejumper. 
[01:43:30]  Vulture McGravejumper.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Yeah, we squeezed him out like a tube of toothpaste, and now it's finally my turn to shine.  I think Scott was the MVP of Jacktober, and I think that's why we got to play a few of these clips today.  Oh, yeah.  This is how it went down on Friday. 
[01:44:00]  Scott Shannon retiring.  Just out of nowhere.  This came out of the blue.  Yeah.  In case you just turned the radio on and you're trying to figure out, what the hell are they talking about?  What the hell are you talking about?  What the hell's going on over there?  This is the last Scott and Todd live show.  We got...  They're going to...  Yeah, next week we're going to...  Messed up.  Yeah, absolutely.  Because Scott, you know what you said?  And this is on it.  I don't care if he wants me to say it or not.  I can't have said through a week of that.  And you know that's him.  Anybody who knows to be like, I don't want to get through a weekend. 
[01:44:30]  I'm going to go down to Florida.  You guys play what you want.  I just got to go clear my head and figure out what I want to do next.  And I...  You know, we haven't done the math on how many shows we've actually done together.  Monk work on that.  Wait, where's the announcement?  Yeah, estimate.  We had all that.  We didn't actually get the announcement.  Yeah, we missed the initial announcement right when he did it.  Because it came out of nowhere.  So this is like when they brought it up again.  You can't get it online?  No, I don't.  You'd think somebody would have posted it somewhere.  No, it's strange.  Nobody did.  That was the weird thing.  No one cares. 
[01:45:00]  No, it's strange.  Scott sounds very, like, clear here.  Yeah, energized.  He hasn't sounded this clear in years.  Ready to go next week.  We're still crunching the numbers.  Yeah, he told us not to.  And also crunching the numbers on how many commercials that we have done together.  We're going to add a few more today.  95.5 BLG.  Right into traffic, right into commercials.  What a fucking shitty, fucking soulless show.  Yeah.  I know you're leaving.  Time for the commercial. 
[01:45:30]  Format clock radio is terrible.  Terrible.  It's brutal.  Oof.  And you can't even, like, you know, fucking go off track ever.  And they can.  Like, he was the program director.  Right.  He could do whatever he wants.  And over the last several years, all of a sudden it became so tight as far as what they do.  So they don't have to do a whole lot of lifting, I guess, for the show.  I love Bill.  He's upset because we didn't tell him.  We weren't really allowed to.  We couldn't tell anybody anything. 
[01:46:00]  I just didn't want.  I didn't want to.  See, that's how you are.  You didn't want a big thing.  And we wanted to plan a whole party.  You know what?  You can open the paper this morning.  There's nothing in the newspaper.  Well, tomorrow there might be.  David Hinckley doesn't know.  No, I mean, no one.  Saturday, nobody cares.  No, of course people care.  But you didn't.  You're not like that.  You were like, ah, listen.  And to be honest with you, there'll be a time for me to do this, too.  Yeah.  And I'll probably handle it the same way.  It's just one of those things where you go like this. 
[01:46:30]  Hey, you know, today's the day and that was it.  Right.  You know, it's just, it's not, it's not me to sit here and, and talk about, and be  marvelous.  No, but you know that people love you and want to say good luck and well wishes and thanks  for all the, you know, I mean, that's, people have been willing to say all the time and they  want to, they want to be able to say that.  And I got to tell you something.  That's the, I think one of the reasons that I've lasted so long in New York is that I do  care about the listeners. 
[01:47:00]  And the same with you, you know, you, you know, we care what they think.  Even YouTube Neil.  Even YouTube Neil.  Even YouTube Neil.  I love that guy.  Today.  What's fucking garbage?  What's garbage this show?  And there's no sincerity to anything.  It's like, the guy's leaving.  Right.  How about you have a, just throw the fucking format out the window and just have a real  conversation about it.  Jesus.  No real moments at all.  Why can't anyone have just a real conversation?  It might also be that he just wanted to get the fuck out of there. 
[01:47:30]  Maybe.  This was his last day.  Just plow through it.  Get it done.  That show fucking stinks.  We also want to point out that this is not, like, it's not being executed.  I'm not, I'm not.  And it's just a decision.  Yeah.  And, and listen, I'll call you all the time.  I mean, you know, I'll bother you and pester you.  It's not.  You need me to do the blast off.  Yeah.  Well, no.  You know, you're not, you're not going to check in, obviously, and, you know, keep in 
[01:48:00]  touch and we're not, it's not the end of it.  We've had so much fun over the years and that's how I remember the show.  Of course.  I mean, there's been, there's been some moments.  Every couple has a spat here or there.  Yep.  Yep.  And there's, you know, the other thing too is.  But pretty good for 23s.  Yeah.  You know, we didn't kill each other.  Scott and Todd, last time around, big show.  What is going on?  What fucking absolute, insincere dog shit.  What the fuck's going on?  It seems like Scott's trying to be classy by saying, oh, nope, my time is done. 
[01:48:30]  I'm going to leave.  And Todd just doesn't give a shit.  Like he's, he said, oh no, we'll miss you.  You know, they're not making eye contact.  He's not even looking at Scott when he's talking.  And Scott's not going to come back.  Of course not.  As soon as they hose down that studio.  Oh yeah.  Hose it down.  Scott's chat will be on the phone and they'll be like, oh yeah.  All right.  You can hear the joy in everyone else's voice.  Of course.  I was working in Albany.  Oh, so here's Todd remembering Scott hiring him. 
[01:49:00]  Oh.  And I'm, I'm slightly connected to this because Todd used to work with my pal, Jim Chandler.  Oh, we all remember Jim Chandler.  And Todd left Jim behind to go to New York City to work with Scott Shannon.  Oh.  My old college roommate who's now in Nashville.  I was working in Albany, New York.  And I remember I was lucky enough to have a little success there. 
[01:49:30]  And to me, when I was hired here, it was very interesting.  I had left Albany to go to Philadelphia.  This is Todd.  I don't recognize that voice.  Give it a few seconds.  Oh, because I'm wondering why do I talk with two different voices?  Why isn't there an ounce of the real person?  Sorry, I didn't recognize that.  I thought it was a new guy.  Yeah.  I had left Albany to go to Philadelphia.  And the radio station had been sold.  So I got a call from Tom Cuddy at that point.  Right. 
[01:50:00]  Who used to be our boss.  And he said, well, you know, we won't be looking for somebody to work with Scott.  And I said, Scott Shannon?  What am I going to do?  What time?  When did you need me up in there?  Oh, it's...  Oh, yeah.  What the fuck is that?  What is that voice?  I don't know.  That's like the crazy guy.  Scott Shannon?  It's his Jerky Boys.  Scott Shannon?  It's a Jerky Boys ripoff.  Can't have a sincere moment at all.  That's just...  But in a nutshell, that's what regular radio is.  And that's why Satellite has over 20 million subscribers. 
[01:50:30]  Thanks, guys.  Keep it up.  Please make sure the company knows that we were, you know, saying something nice about  him today.  Oh, you can skip five if you want on that.  Because every time we say something bad, oh, boy, do we hear it.  Did you hear something?  Oh, Friday, I got a talking, too.  Did you?  Yeah.  I went home...  Oh, Jimmy.  I went home feeling fucking shitty and miserable.  And we had a great show Friday and a great week of radio.  What was the...  It's funny...  Someone got in my face about the Pat Cooper thing, still.  Really?  Still. 
[01:51:00]  And how that hurts us.  Well, how does that hurt us?  How does that hurt us?  How come we never get credit for the good things we say?  Thank you.  That's what I said.  I've never once...  That's what I said.  And I go, how about all the shit that we should be pissed off about?  I've never once gotten anybody in the company to go, hey, you plugged us in every single  regular radio spot you do.  Right.  Sirius XM gets a mention.  We talk about the...  Like, not once has anyone in the company ever said, that's really great that you do that.  Right.  Not once in years.  I walked out of Tim's office.  I said, I'm too old for this shit. 
[01:51:30]  Meaning, I'm not going to be yelled at or talked down to.  And I walked out.  I'm like, we had a great week of radio.  I went home feeling shitty.  It's like, oh, this is setting us back.  This is setting the show back.  This is setting everything back with you guys in the company.  I'm like, then fucking fire me or fire us.  What do you want from us?  We just had an amazing show today.  An amazing week of radio.  And you're going to get in my face about an 85-year-old guy rambling about Howard Stern. 
[01:52:00]  And if he rambles about Howard Stern, how's that us fucking the company?  You guys need each other.  Meaning, us and Howard.  I'm like, I don't fucking need him.  And he doesn't fucking need us.  What are you talking about?  How about...  And it doesn't mean we hate Sirius XM.  The company didn't invite...  If the company had invited this show, like, it was like no one in this show was permitted to go.  But if they reached out and said, hey, look, bygones be bygones.  And then you turn around and say, should he think?  That's a little bit different.  I said, look, you know, obviously we wouldn't have gone to Howard's birthday party. 
[01:52:30]  But why don't you go upstairs and go, why were my guys not invited to the thing?  And why were they told to make sure they stay the fuck away from the event?  Shouldn't my guys be pissed off at that as far as a big company goes?  Holy fuck.  If you can't, like, decipher the ramblings of an 85-year-old who's extremely sharp and funny  as fuck and also knows how to burn a bridge or two. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, yeah.  And if you can't understand why that's really good radio that doesn't actually hurt Sirius XM,  I don't know what to tell you.  I don't fucking know what to tell you, man.  Look, our show had nothing to say about the birthday party because none of us were allowed near it.  So we had to do some kind of commentary.  Yeah.  You know, it was so much fun to listen to.  And rags everybody anyway.  Yeah, that's what Pat does.  And when these mics go off for the day and I go home, that's all I give a fuck about.  Was that entertaining to the people? 
[01:53:30]  Who gives a fuck that someone's shallow ego got hurt?  Who gives a fuck?  That's his problem, not ours.  You know?  And if you had a problem with what Pat Cooper had to say,  then say it on your own fucking radio show instead of making phone calls behind the scenes.  But I had to hear it on Friday.  I'm like, what are you doing?  It doesn't hurt the company.  I'll go talk to the guy upstairs.  No problem.  Yeah, we should go right to him and ask for the blank check to go to the cruise. 
[01:54:00]  Why not?  Yeah.  Since blank checks are being handed out, why don't we get one for the cruise?  That would be a very fun company event.  Right.  Yeah.  I'll continue to stay positive in this fine new year.  But that was just like, you got to be shitting me.  You got to be fucking shitting me.  It absolutely does not hurt the fucking company what Pat Cooper is talking about.  It was entertaining as all hell in the end.  Period.  Scott wouldn't let Todd talk back in the day. 
[01:54:30]  Why are we skipping this?  Because you could move on past that.  It's just him telling me.  We want to move past this.  We want to hear as much fake voice, guys, as we possibly can.  Just an absolute thrill for me.  And I can't tell you how much I've learned from you over the years.  And, you know, it just...  There are no words to sum up our relationship.  Our relationship isn't over by any means.  But it's another chapter.  You know, the funny thing...  That's all horse shit.  Fucking corporate shit. 
[01:55:00]  Another chapter.  See, they're splitting up for whatever reason.  Whether it's a contract thing.  Whether Scott can't do it anymore.  Or they just fucking hate each other.  Whatever the fuck it is.  It's bullshit.  But Todd knows that he's got to keep the peace here.  Yeah.  He wants to keep the audience they have as he moves on as a solo guy.  The funny thing about working with you is that...  Nothing.  A lot of people that you work with have strengths in some areas.  Mm-hmm.  And when Todd first came in, and he'll never let me forget this, I said, 
[01:55:30]  Tell you what, when I point to you, you do the weather.  And because I didn't know what he was capable of.  I was standing on a step stool, remember?  Yeah.  You was the weather girl?  I had no...  I'd never run into anybody like this before that could do...  First of all, he's got a photographic memory, which is great.  Right.  And he's got instant recall of things that happened.  No, but this isn't about me.  This is about you.  Well, wait a minute.  This is about you.  So finally, he goes...  I find out.  He goes home and tells him,  I don't know how long I can work with this guy either.  Let me talk.  And then finally, I think, 
[01:56:00]  You know what?  I had no idea you were that good.  I said, Well, you hired me the first two minutes you hired me.  You hired me the first two minutes you hired me.  You hired me because you thought it was dying guys.  You didn't know who we were talking.  I think we've done something together that not many people can say they've ever done,  which is 23 years in New York City, the number one market in the country, and successful.  Now, it wasn't always great in the beginning. 
[01:56:30]  You know, we felt our way.  But really, I'm just so happy that I was given the opportunity to work with you.  And obviously, we'll continue to talk like we always do.  But, you know, it's the end of an era.  And Monk and Cooper and I are staying.  And we'll go on and we'll do another show.  But, you know, it'll never be the Scott and Todd show again.  And I just wanted to really thank you for all you've taught me.  And I just learned so much. 
[01:57:00]  And, you know, it's one of those things where you can't find words to say, you know,  I mean, I love you.  You're like a brother.  And I'm happy that you're going to probably bring your handicap down now a little bit.  Get down a little bit.  You don't have to sandbag anymore.  746.  This is extremely boring.  Wow.  But in that clip, that was the one that really got me upset. 
[01:57:30]  Because you can, like he's saying, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  But it's like he's slowly just pushing Scott's chair out of the studio.  Oh, he can't wait.  And it's like that scene you bring up about about Schmidt.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Where he's showing him where the files are, how he did everything.  And the guy's going, sure, sure.  Here's where you're good at.  Come on, come on, come on.  I remember you told me how to make a funny voice.  But I don't blame, I don't even blame Todd.  I don't even like Todd.  This happens to all of us.  Whether it's in radio or whatever the fuck you're into.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just get fucking pushed out in the end. 
[01:58:00]  No one gives a fuck.  Push him out.  What you possibly did in that profession.  No one wants to hear about your fucking take on the business.  They don't give a fuck.  Your advice.  Take your stupid cardboard box.  Get your shit.  Yeah.  Get the fuck out of here.  And whatever you leave behind, we're going to throw in a dumpster.  That's how it ends for just about everyone.  Are you kidding me?  Well, the next track is another one you can skip if you want.  I was getting all cheery-eyed, by the way.  It's him thanking people. 
[01:58:30]  But it kind of cuts off.  Are you a little sad today?  A little bit.  For real, right?  A little bit, yeah.  He's a real radio guy.  This shit bothers Eric.  And he worked over there.  I don't think he's going out in the right way.  But nobody does in the radio.  He should go out like our Bud Dwyer.  Who gave you the sex bagel name?  Oh, that was in college.  What?  I thought there was the big story about how they said Eric Nagel the sex bagel.  No, it wasn't them.  Scott and Todd.  Oh.  No, no, no, no.  Oh, see, I get those stories.  They had no knowledge of that.  One of the best stories. 
[01:59:00]  That's great.  That's amazing.  But Scott was just thanking everybody.  Yeah.  If you go to track eight, Todd jumps in because Scott's going a little long with who he's  thanking.  Oh.  Salespeople, clients, former bosses.  Because you've got to stay on that clock, right?  Right, Todd?  Even on Scott's last day, let's stay on the clock.  So just picture Scott doing, there's emotional music and Scott's thanking everybody that he  knows.  Right.  And start track eight where Todd just kind of has to jump in and we've got to end the  show.  And Eric Nagel, I want to thank that kid. 
[01:59:30]  I want to thank Young.  I'm the wrong voice.  And we want to thank you, obviously, all of us.  Right.  Absolutely.  You have a lot of the staff in here.  And, you know, you set the bar in this business, Scott, and none of us will ever forget that.  And we've learned so much and we'll continue, obviously, to stay in touch.  And you'll keep us posted on what's happening with you.  But we just sincerely, from the bottom of our hearts, I speak for all of us when I say  thank you.  Thanks for teaching us. 
[02:00:00]  Thanks for showing us the way.  Showing us the way.  And, you know, you'll always have a place here.  Yeah, thank you.  It's been a great ride, my friend.  That's all I got.  So one more time, I've got to say thank you and bye, buckaroos.  Ew, buckaroos.  Thank you for being a friend.  Oh, no.  Wait, where's the song?  Who sang that?  That's an original song.  Yeah.  Did Todd sing that? 
[02:00:30]  No, it's a real song.  Oh, okay.  That's the song.  It was a song parody.  Goodbye, buckaroos.  He says that?  That's his sign-off?  Yeah, for years.  Goodbye, buckaroos.  And then he used to play Happy Trails.  It was the Golden Girls song that they just played.  Yeah.  It wasn't the same version or something.  No, that's it.  Yeah.  Well, that was, uh, boring.  That's right.  Yeah.  Do you think it's medical or no?  I don't think so.  I'm hearing it's just contractual.  Wait, don't they go together and sign up together or no? 
[02:01:00]  I guess not.  I guess, I mean, my guess is that Scott didn't get the deal that he wanted and they're trying,  that station's not doing very well.  Oh, wait, do you think, I'm sorry to interrupt you.  Do you think it's because maybe they both said, look, the company said, we'll give you this  and Todd went, all right, I'll take that.  And Scott went, ah, fuck it.  I'm just kidding.  Maybe it's nothing between them.  I don't know.  Their show has been shit for the last several years.  And then we've featured it many times.  There's just no chemistry between them anymore.  There's no real ratings going on there?  No.  That station never really was in the top 10, but it's one of the highest billing in New 
[02:01:30]  York City.  And that's why they've lasted so long, because they do everything.  So, you got me a clip of Scott Shannon's first day on PLJ.  Yeah, you could probably just go to 10, because every time you mention Scott, Anthony goes,  Mojo Radio.  Oh yeah, let's just play it.  You got his first day on PLJ?  Yeah.  Yeah, why would we skip that track? 
[02:02:00]  This is way more interesting than him saying goodbye.  Scott, this is what this guy used to sound like, which is pretty fucking amazing.  Mojo Radio.  The Mojo Houseman.  It's a little bit after 6 a.m., Thursday, April the 11th, 1991. 
[02:02:30]  Michael Scott Shannon is back home on the radio in New York.  Good morning.  Mojo Radio.  That sounds weird.  Good morning, America.  It is Scott Shannon back home again at 6.07.  Instant weather for Mojo Radio.  Joey B on the streets this morning at Mojo Party.  We're throwing that new Mojo van.  Mojo Nolan doing that ever-popular metro traffic.  As soon as I figure out how to operate it, it is Shannon in the morning on the air everywhere. 
[02:03:00]  Good morning.  Shannon in the morning.  Mojo Radio.  Fucking awful.  Mojo Radio.  But that worked back in 1991, and you see, you hear his voice.  It's just like power.  That's a powerful voice.  He's talking fast.  He's got it.  He's in the moment, and he's got this.  You know what I mean?  Wasn't he around before then, too?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's been around for fucking ever.  70s or something, right?  When was he here first?  No, he's not.  83.  He started at Z100. 
[02:03:30]  And then he left for a while, and then he came back.  He left L.A. for a couple years, came back for a PLJ.  Did he fail in L.A.?  Yeah, it didn't work out.  And then Scott does a break here.  That was just kind of an intro.  Then here's him doing a break.  She looks good on video, but she's frightening in person.  Believe me, divinals, I touch myself.  Good morning, America.  Rambi-jambi.  Michael Scott, Janet, transfrontated around the world on the Mojo Radio and the Continental  Satellite Broadcast Network.  Broadcasting live and direct from those brand new, way down deep under the street, and right 
[02:04:00]  next door to the basketball floor, Rock and Roll Mojo Studios, where the new family, we  mentioned them earlier in the morning, we are on 95.5 FM in the metropolitan New York  City area, anywhere else, we're on the Satellite Satcom 1R, Transponder 23, Channel 16.  Of course, we're in Mojo Stereo.  Thanks to David Hinkley, the Daily News.  Kind of neat, he always was a little slicker than the rest.  This morning, in the Daily News, in Hinkley's column, everything you wanted to know about 
[02:04:30]  Mojo.  Mojo, a quick refresh, of course, on what Mojo really means.  Oh, no.  Anyway, we'll figure it out later on.  It's all in there, if you want to know it.  Ladies and gentlemen, 6.15, checking the sports.  Yeah, man, I mean, just broadcast noise.  You can tell he's like a real radio guy, though.  He's a fucking...  Oh, yeah, it's not anything I was ever interested in doing, but you could just hear the power  and the voice.  Good talker, yeah.  Holy fuck.  There you go.  So, see you later, Scott Shannon.  Yeah, good luck to you, Scott.  I'm so fucking literally...  For five million a year, I think he had a good career.  That's what he's making?  Yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Back to regular radio.  Well, give it six months.  They'll probably get rid of the Todd show and need something new when they kill that format.  Hey, I got an offer.  I'm going to New York.  I'm going to go do the 95.5 WPRJ.  Bring it back, Mojo Radio.  Mojo Radio and PFG TV.  Well, I can't call it Mojo Radio.  I'll get sued.  I'm going to call it Nojo Radio.  Nojo Radio.  Nojo Radio.  You know what the N stands for?  No, totally.  It's Nood Mojo Radio. 
[02:05:30]  Nojo.  That's right.  That's right.  That's what I do.  Well, let's say goodbye to Scott Shannon, the MVP of Jocktober.  Yes, absolutely.  With this as we go to break.  Oh.  It's like a battery car.  I will remember you.  I can't even feel my own nose.  Will you remember me?  And we know how much you like it. 
[02:06:00]  Well, they leave it to your own devices.  Let your life pass you by.  Lucy, you got some explaining to do.  You can see his pee-pee is a different color because people are always rubbing on it.  Yeah.  I'm so tired that I can't sleep.  I want to see the boat movie.  Standing on the edge is something that's beauty. 
[02:06:30]  It's funny how it feels so much.  I cannot say no.  Dump me on my head, you know?  You're screaming inside of me.  Can't be heard.  I will remember you.  I don't think that's what that is.  Will you remember me?  I can't feel my own nose. 
[02:07:00]  Don't let your life pass you by.  Weep not fall.  Does this ever happen to you?  You're all scratched up.  You got pine needles coming out of your skin.  You're sweating.  Then you get home and you go like it.  It's a little crooked, isn't it?  Weep not fall.  The memory.  I got a tree on my house. 
[02:07:30]  Whoa.  Hello, this is Ricky Gervais.  The Opie and Anthony show.  We'll be back after a short break.  Do they really need a break?  I mean, they're sitting down, talking, sometimes not talking.  Yeah, yeah.  Have a break, guys.  See you soon.

Opie and Anthony have been creating radio gold for 20 years.  Not bad for children of the 80s.  Digging through the history, here's a 20th anniversary Opie and Anthony radio gem.  And welcome, Donald Rumsfeld, to the Opie and Anthony show.  Sir?  Yes, indeed.  How are you?  Very good.  Very good.  What a pleasure to talk to you. 
[02:16:30]  Boy, you have been a part of history in this country for many years, known many presidents.  Welcome to the show, Mr. Rumsfeld.  Well, thank you.  It's a little embarrassing to discover that I've lived one-third of the history of our country.  One-third the history.  And been involved in a lot of things that have gone on through history.  Here's a guy who, you know, met Eisenhower as a congressman, right?  I was running for Congress, exactly.  And, you know, worked for Ford and Nixon and Reagan and both Bushes. 
[02:17:00]  And there's still those people out there that think, you know, Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney are actually lizards who, I mean, literally, there's people that think they're lizards from outer space.  Yeah, that's true.  Who eat human flesh.  I don't know if anybody's ever asked you directly, sir, but are you a lizard?  I don't think he's a lizard.  Actually, can you just please give that a straight answer? 
[02:17:30]  Are you a lizard person?  Louie's a little left-leaning, sir.  No, I'm not.  I'm not.  Let him answer, are you a lizard?  Here's the short answer.  I'm in New York City.  I walk down the street.  People walk up, shake hands, stop me.  They want an autograph.  He's a lizard.  I want to get a photograph with me.  Go to eat last night at dinner, and Joyce and I were sitting there in the little Italian restaurant.  And a man came up.  He might be a lizard.  He'd like to buy my dinner.  Yeah.  And it turns out I paid for my dinner.  The next thing I know, the waiter comes back and said, the man insisted to pay for your 
[02:18:00]  dinner, and here's your canceled receipt for me.  Oh, wow.  That's very nice.  See, there's plenty of people that he's not going to dignify an answer to, are you a lizard,  Louie?  Why not?  Because he's not a lizard.  What is the story about getting somebody paid for your dinner?  I would pay for a lizard's dinner.  I think I understood the fact that there are people out there that appreciate what he's  done as a leader.  There is plenty of evidence that this guy is a well-decorated and appreciated American, 
[02:18:30]  and he has more credibility than almost anybody.  Exactly.  But I just want to know if he's a lizard.  He's not a lizard.  Stop it.  Mr. Rumsfeld, I want to ask you a little bit about the situation that's going on now in the  Middle East.  You are an envoy to the Middle East.  What do you see happening there?  What's your take on the whole situation?  And these are great questions, Anthony, and they're questions that Mr. Rumsfeld is going  to answer better than almost anybody in the world.  Yeah.  But I still want to know if he's a lizard.  And if he is...  Stop it.  If he's tasted human flesh. 
[02:19:00]  No, stop.  I just want to know.  Mr. Rumsfeld, again, I want to apologize for Louie C.K.  He's an extended comedian.  Look, if he's a lizard who has eaten people...  Don't encourage him.  It'll just make him worse.  See, and I will stop Mr. Rumsfeld.  The second I get a denial, I'll stop asking.  Tell Louie that my grandchildren are listening.  See?  Well, listen, they have a right to know, too.  No, he's not a lizard.  And he's not tasted human flesh.  You've waited over five minutes. 
[02:19:30]  And finally, ladies and gentlemen, it's time!  The Opie and Anthony Show is back!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Opie!  Jamie's crying!  He's scared, dude. 
[02:20:00]  36 years ago today.  What?  It's crazy.  I think I hit that one.  I...  I remember this.  Sure.  36 years?  Yeah.  Van Halen's debut album.  I remember putting on those big headphones.  I could plug the jack into the phonograph and blast them this album.  Well, the headphones are getting big again.  Yeah.  It's not cool if you go with the buds anymore.  No.  Buds don't even keep noise out.  That's what buds meant, the buds.  I can fucking hear everything with the buds on. 
[02:20:30]  Yes, the buds.  I got to like...  Stop saying buds.  I know.  In this room, it's the last word I ever want to say.  Sink buds.  Yeah.  Those stupid buds fall out of my right ear.  Yeah.  I think I got a birth defect in the ear canal or something.  It's too wide.  I don't know.  I can't get anything to stay in that fucking thing.  It throws me nuts.  Chewing gum.  Yeah, exactly.  Or a nail.  Well, it's not anything.  We've got to have David Lee Roth back on soon. 
[02:21:00]  It's been too long.  Oh, my God.  Shaddy.  It's just...  Shaddy.  Those are those days where you look at the sheet and you see, oh, who's coming in today?  And you go, oh, David Lee Roth.  And I'm just like, oh, fuck.  Because it's exhausting.  I think I don't even have to be there.  Oh.  Nice.  Just sit back and listen.  You've got to try to, like, converse with him.  And I don't know.  Yeah.  He's on a whole other level.  And then he wouldn't do a fucking...  He wouldn't do some... 
[02:21:30]  Production for us.  ...liners for us and stuff.  Why?  Oh, no.  He takes the Van Halen stuff very seriously.  Yeah.  What would he do?  We wanted him to do some song parodies.  And he informed us that he does not make light of his music.  Yeah.  Did he do other production or no?  I think he's done, like...  Yeah, he does some shit.  ...liners there and there.  He was all right.  It's like...  Let's go to the wall.  Let's, uh...  Let's go to the wall.  Let's say hi to Jim in Jersey.  Jim, I'm right here, buddy.  Oh. 
[02:22:00]  Hey, how you doing, guys?  Good.  What's up, Jim in Jersey?  Jim, how are you?  Hey, Chipper.  It's another Jim from Jersey.  That's funny.  I didn't even hear what he said.  It's another Chipper from Jersey.  That's...  My dad.  He basically wants to say that he saw Lady Dive's tits.  Uh-huh.  And he almost crashed his car.  They're terrible.  They really are terrible.  They're boobs.  They're flat.  Like, not even flat the way they're supposed to be.  They're flat, like, from top to bottom. 
[02:22:30]  Is she a flat toe?  Like, I don't know what you'd call it.  They were...  I guess they're supposed to be big if they were inflated or something.  Yeah, they look like deflated fucking balloons.  Definitely.  Looks like she has a leak or two.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Bed buggy tits.  I can't hear.  I love...  And I love how fucking Marion talks about her body.  Right.  Looking good?  Yeah, looking good, losing weight.  I don't know what's going on under her shirts.  Those things...  Like, I think if both of her tits, like, if you measured them... 
[02:23:00]  Right.  They're probably three feet across.  They're giant.  They're giant.  I think if we saw Marion naked, I would bet a lot of money that more than one person would  start puking.  Would just start puking.  Just a trollish thing body.  Do you know, that could have went either way when you started that sentence.  You know, if we saw Marion naked, it could be like we'd be pleasantly surprised.  Oh, God, no.  You just know.  But no one saw we'd probably just start puking.  Puking.  Well, because she talks about how good she looks. 
[02:23:30]  You know, she loves it.  I've been losing weight.  Good for her, but...  Look at my butt's smaller now.  Look at her bubs.  They die.  Her bubs.  She was showing them a lot during Super Show, too.  She loved showing those.  Look how they rest on her gut.  The top of her gut.  Did Jim come?  Huh?  Did Jim come, the guy?  No.  You mean Bill?  Oh, Bill.  Oh, yeah.  No, we told Bill to stay home.  It was too much.  Yeah.  Hey, you want to talk about 90 Day Fiancé?  Episode 4? 
[02:24:00]  Yeah, I want to talk about nothing but that show.  So why do you love this show so much, Jim Norton?  Because me and Anne have been in for a while, and now you're finally in.  Well, the clips got me, honestly.  Makes me very happy.  And...  Because I hate reality shows, but these are actually...  Even though I know that they do edit it and assist it and all that, I do believe the basic  premise is that they are going to either get married or not.  Uh-huh.  And I like these.  I actually found myself liking these people very much.  Yeah.  I like the cowboy guy who we thought was a little questionable. 
[02:24:30]  A little mysterious.  A little mysterious, right?  Yeah.  I think he's definitely into her.  Yeah.  And she's definitely into him.  I like the Brazilian girl very much.  She's beautiful, huh?  She's very beautiful.  And I'm watching the modeling thing, and he's a little scared.  Oh, he's scared.  But I like them.  Yeah.  The Russian girl, I think, is fucking beautiful.  But she doesn't seem to want to kiss the other guy because he'll suck down a ciggy and  then come in reeking of ciggy.  Ciggy.  This guy is so out of his league. 
[02:25:00]  Wouldn't you stop smoking immediately?  He loves his ciggy.  Yeah.  If you got a girl like that?  Yeah.  He'll suck one down and blow it up.  And then go in for a nice wet kiss.  Right, right.  Immediately.  And I feel bad for the...  Would you join a gym and stop smoking immediately?  Really?  Go ahead.  Sorry, Jeremy.  That's okay.  I feel bad for the guys who are a little bit broke.  Like the Asian girl.  I think she's...  From the Philippines?  She's a nice girl, man.  But she just assumed a lot.  Like, you come to America, people have money.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She got one of the broke dudes. 
[02:25:30]  Oh, boy, is he broke.  Damn.  And I don't hate his ex-wife.  She's a little irritating, but I get why she has questions.  But a lot of that's just the editing.  I actually like all of these people.  Yeah.  As I'm saying this, a bullet should rip through my forehead.  I like them.  But I really like all four of them.  But we're convinced they're all a bunch of saps.  Right.  Jimmy's taking a whole other take on this thing.  I don't like Jimmy's...  Jimmy's take on it is that...  We enjoy the show because they're a bunch of saps.  They're all nice people who are very pleasant and deserve happiness. 
[02:26:00]  And we're like, I want to see this fail.  I want to see her, like, run off with someone and leave them crying.  Jim watches for the reasons you're supposed to watch it.  Right.  Jim likes it for the same reason my wife likes it.  Oh, God.  That's right.  Because it's 30 minutes.  We don't have to talk to you.  We're 60.  60.  But no, I really do.  And I was surprised.  I found myself because I did the four episodes when I was away.  All four in completion.  Yeah.  And I was like, I really like these guys.  Like, I just think that they're nice people. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  And the Ciggy Breath guy, it's like, dude, you got to quit fucking sucking down...  Those Ciggies.  Stop sucking down Ciggies without a cigarette with your dumb beard.  Right.  Drop a few pounds.  This Russian girl, I'm telling you, I know you don't love her.  She's a fucking knockout.  When she smiles, I see it.  But she doesn't smile a lot, which is creepy to me.  She won't eat in front of people.  She's got some weird food issues.  Oh, yeah.  We all know where I'm going with this.  Something happened.  She's weird.  She doesn't want to fuck Ciggy Breath because he probably turns her off a lot. 
[02:27:00]  And Ciggy Breath's family and friends are convinced that, you know, this broad is using Mike.  Gold digger.  Right.  Yeah.  But the family likes her now after episode four.  Well, we're going to start with Russ and Pow, Pow, Pow.  Who's getting a lot of followers from our radio show.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  She's doing pretty good on the Twitter.  I think she's approaching 6,000 out of nowhere.  And I believe she's...  She's over 6,000.  Oh, she's over 6,000 now.  Why?  You're keeping a close eye on her?  I don't follow her, but I do check her out.  I'm very selective.  I believe she's following all four people in this room. 
[02:27:30]  Yay.  Uh-huh.  Yes.  Nice.  Very nice.  Did you start following her Instagram, too?  Oh, fuck.  No.  Oh, man, dude.  That's where the fucking pictures are.  That's where the shit is.  Yeah, follow her Instagram.  That's where the good stuff is.  Yep.  Oh, yeah.  None of that cut shit.  This is fucking pure.  Pure pow pow.  She posts these pictures, and it's like, well, off to the gym.  And it's like, ah!  Ah! 
[02:28:00]  What's her Instagram on...  What's her Instagram?  I'm not telling.  I don't know offhand.  You're going to have to find it on your own.  When you get there, let us know there, Sam.  We're going to start with Russ and pow.  We only have one clip from Russ and pow from episode four.  Yeah, their storyline wasn't really progressed the way...  No.  Some of the others were.  We talked about the apartment that he can't afford.  Talked about the jacuzzi last time, right?  Yeah.  His dumb hat.  Here's why I like them, though, because they do the apartment bit, and she's like, thank 
[02:28:30]  you.  She thanked him because she knew that that was a big thing for him to get the apartment.  I was just like, ah, good.  I wanted them to get that.  I really am becoming an old woman.  Jimmy looks at it like he would want...  Oh, my God.  I'm not a good shock jock.  This is how TLC wants you to look at it.  I know.  I know.  I know.  Oh, my God.  Jimmy, I could tell what Jimmy does.  He looks at this as if he's the guy.  Right.  Of course.  Everyone does it.  You look at that like that.  No, not really, because I want to see these guys...  No, I don't want to be any of these shatters.  I want to see them fucking destroyed.  Right.  But you look at it like, oh, I would like if the girl did that to me, and oh, that's 
[02:29:00]  sweet.  She's appreciative of this.  And you think of it in those terms.  I'm like, oh, this sap.  Jim is like seeing all the guys being treated like saps and going, oh, but she's got good  intentions.  She wouldn't do that to me.  That's right.  I think...  No, but I don't think they're treating them like saps, though.  I think that they're...  No, these...  They totally are.  They're not, though.  They're foreign girls coming here in 90 days to get married, and all of them seem to want  money.  That's what I don't necessarily believe.  This is what I think happens. 
[02:29:30]  These are probably guys that were dating these girls.  Like the one guy said, I've known her for a year.  He didn't fuck the Russian girl.  I've known her for a year and a half.  Online.  Yeah, but they've been communicating for a long time.  If she was just trying to get here in 90, she's hot enough to find another guy.  And I don't know if they're fucked or not.  I think some of these broads, they know they've got to start somewhere.  They've just got to get in to the game, meaning get married, and then they can move on to  better guys.  And maybe she's afraid if she fucked them.  Maybe they're afraid if they give that pussy right up, the guy will lose interest and 
[02:30:00]  send them back.  Look at her Instagram.  Look at her Instagram.  Look at that, right?  What is she on Instagram?  Pow 8705?  She's loving it.  P-A-O 8705 on Instagram.  Now her Instagram's going to blow up.  That's her getting ready for the gym.  Just getting ready for the gym.  Just getting ready.  Go out to the gym.  Yeah.  Fuck.  Unbelievable, right?  Not one picture with Russ, by the way.  Well, they're probably not supposed to.  That's what the cowboy hat.  Uh-huh.  Well, yeah, but notice Russ isn't in that picture.  A little cropping done there. 
[02:30:30]  Yeah.  Why would they not have pictures of each other?  I think none of them on social media are supposed to show if they're together or not.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  If they're together or not.  Yeah, I think that way it adds to the mystery.  She's sexy, man.  All right, so Russ takes her to a football game, and she's really not into football.  She didn't know what tailgating was.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Whoops.  This is my fiance.  Paola.  I love your name.  Where are you from?  Colombia.  Wonderful.  Welcome.  Thank you so much. 
[02:31:00]  Really?  When are you getting married?  Well, I was thinking about December 7th.  They almost killed me.  I go, no way.  This is a big game.  I started looking at the football schedule, and it's a pretty big day.  Yeah.  See?  No.  This still game seems really fun, but I don't understand why this football game is more important  than my wife.  It's true.  You have to teach me, like, things about the football americano.  I always imagined that I'd marry a girl that was a big football fan. 
[02:31:30]  I am concerned how Paola is going to fit in.  Mm-mm.  I thought it was funny that he always wanted to marry somebody that was a big football fan.  That's just...  Like, really?  Why do you need that?  Yeah, why?  That's a mystery to that statement.  I don't know what that even means.  Why would...  Is anybody's wife, like, a big football fan?  Yeah.  I don't think it's a necessity that your wife is into the same sport you're into. 
[02:32:00]  Like, when you meet Paola, whether or not she's a football fan is so far down on the list.  I wouldn't care if she cheered on beheading.  Yes.  Right.  And as a Colombian, she probably has.  Of course.  And have been a part of them and lured people to them.  Because Sosa says so?  You expect me to believe he's mysterious because Sosa says so?  I told you a long time ago not to have Sigi breath. 
[02:32:30]  You expect me to believe the fat boy has Sigi breath because the Russian says so?  Is that your favorite couple?  I don't know.  Russian and Sigi breath.  But I also love the model and her guy.  I think that they're doing okay.  Oh, my God.  I do.  He wants to marry her faster.  He is so insecure.  And you know, dude, he wants to marry her faster because he knows that if she gets too much knowledge, she's so gone.  But she doesn't.  I think because she's a family values girl, I don't think she will run off on this.  I don't think she's a family. 
[02:33:00]  She's not a family.  You're a fucking mind?  She's not a family value girl.  She comes from a tiny little town.  She doesn't know anything.  That's the problem.  She's ignorant of the whole thing right now.  There's a ridiculous innocence there because where she's from.  That has nothing to do with family values.  Pro athletes start coming on to her.  She's obsessed with Johnny Depp.  That doesn't mean she has family values.  I think that she...  I mean, she wants a big penis.  Oh, yes.  No, not necessarily.  I think you guys are being very negative.  This is like seventh grade Jim, like, who has a crush on a girl but then makes believe that they're in this loving relationship. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah, the fact that I'm delusional is not questioned.  I understand that.  And I am an ass, to be honest.  However, I do believe what I'm saying is correct.  Yeah.  Well, why don't we move on to the next couple?  It's not going to be Siggy Breath yet.  Not yet.  We're going to move on to Louis and Aya.  Aya, whatever.  Aya.  Aya.  Aya.  That's the Filipino brat who came to America from a shithole shantytown.  And it's not much better in America, which I think completely pisses her off because she thinks all Americans at least have some money, at least more money than where she came from. 
[02:34:00]  Well, she's obviously taken off guard.  And then I love the scenario that Jim was talking about last week that the producers are just sending this guy Louis into places where he can't afford any of the clothes.  Yes, they are.  Right.  And so Louis, with his awesome deep radio voice, is going, we can't afford this.  We can't afford this.  And I think the attraction for a lot of these women to find love in America is because they'll have a better life. 
[02:34:30]  Uh-huh.  But it's safe to say this Aya, Aya, whatever.  Aya.  Her life is probably going to be worse in America than back in the Philippines.  All signs point to that, yes.  She's got this guy, Louis, who has absolutely no money.  I would love to know what he does for a living.  Do they ever say?  I don't recall.  And he's got two kids and an overbearing ex-wife.  And she moved into this situation.  And they went dress shopping. 
[02:35:00]  Yes.  This could be my favorite moment of the show.  It is so far.  Yes.  It's even better than when they went pants shopping.  Same premise, pretty much.  But now they're going wedding dress shopping.  Dude, wedding dresses, when women go wedding dress shopping, it is a nightmare.  The amount of money that people fucking spend on a wedding dress.  Oh, yeah.  Tens of thousands.  It's unbelievable.  Well, this is where they want to be princesses.  Right.  So they want to get the most expensive princesses.  Wait until you hear what the number was for her wedding dress.  Right.  This is why this clip is amazing to me. 
[02:35:30]  And I felt kind of bad for her.  You know.  Oh, Nana.  He's in no position to have a woman, then.  He's got to get his shit together.  Well, she just wants it to be a big, special day.  And she's not being cunty about it.  You know, and she gets upset.  She's crying, because she cannot fathom that the guy can't afford, I don't want to give  the number away yet.  Imagine flying in from the Philippines.  Right.  And you get to the guy's house, and you realize it's a shitty house with dirty dishes still  in the sink, and he hasn't been there in a week. 
[02:36:00]  Right.  Yeah.  Then you find out he can't buy you pants.  Right.  And then you find out he has two chubby kids that love wrestling.  Oh, those little fat kids he's got.  He's got two chubby kids to fight each other.  And then he's got a chubby kids.  And then he's got a trucker ex-wife.  With a giant upper beer belly thing happening.  And then you go to the wedding dress store and be like, you know what?  I'm going to turn this into a special day.  And he tells you what the budget is.  Right.  Wait till you hear this number.  I know a lot of our listeners have seen the episode. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  This is unbelievable.  Because I'm so far away from my family, and I changed my whole life just to be with  Louis.  Yeah, yeah.  I just really wanted my wedding to be extra special.  I was looking for a sheath dress.  And we're trying to see if we can find any dresses that are decent for around $300.  $300.  $300. 
[02:37:00]  He interrupts her.  That's?  Describing her dream dress.  Before you go any further, we're looking for a $300 dress.  $300?  That's it?  You can't get a bouquet for $300.  I don't even know where you find a wedding dress for $300.  Louis, you know, it's really weird.  I've got my weird medicine show.  Yeah.  That's who I sound like, and I brought her over from the Philippines, you know, and she's  She was living in a squalor.  Yeah, she was living in a shanty town, and brought her over to do experiments on her clitoris 
[02:37:30]  with a knee.  $300 wedding dress.  He has to stay on budget.  What does this guy do for a living?  What does he do?  What do they say?  Around $300.  It's not real.  It's interesting.  So, um, I don't know, do you want to look around?  Yeah, we definitely wanted to take him around.  Okay.  The music is annoying.  It's like that dopey music, like, uh, what's his, Lex Luthor's fucking fat... 
[02:38:00]  Yeah, exactly.  Ned Beatty's fucking...  Ned Beatty and Superman.  Hey, Mr. Luthor.  Mr. Luthor.  Mr. Luthor.  Bumbling tarred music.  Mwap, mwap, mwap, mwap.  Mwap.  They're trying to make this poor guy really look like a fool.  A schlub.  What are you drinking?  Pea soup?  No, it's not pee.  It's a fucking Nutribullet.  Nutribullet, bitch.  But what's in it?  I gave Dr. Ian Smith plenty of time.  I'm officially saying I use the Nutribullet.  That's great, but what is in it?  This has kale, strawberry, banana, and orange. 
[02:38:30]  Kale.  It's all sugar, dummy.  And flaxseed.  Good.  Why is it so small?  Why does it have a big fucking...  I go with the bigger container, because I'm a bigger boy.  Why do you have a tiny container, you fucking pud pumper?  What's wrong with you?  Nothing.  A little fireplug container.  Oh, look.  Portable.  Look at that.  Easy to stock in the glove compartment.  Shoving your butt.  I feel you.  Yes.  I feel like you're leaving me out.  You didn't ask what's in mind.  Ask Opie what's in mind.  Because I know that you've got fruit.  I'm used to seeing you drink that stuff.  Mine is spinach. 
[02:39:00]  Mm-hmm.  Because you asked.  Okay.  Kale, banana, strawberries, and mango today.  So it's delicious.  Yeah, but I'm used to seeing Opie drink green stuff.  And a handful of oatmeal just to keep me filled up for a few hours.  I forgot.  I didn't put flaxseed.  I put chia seed in mine today.  Oh, the hell?  Chia seed's a superfood.  Hold on, it must be a death in the building.  Yes.  Yes, Kenny.  Sam has a baby bottle.  You do.  They come with this one. 
[02:39:30]  Oh, that is funny.  Like, you have the regular size one, and then Sam is like the mini-me version.  But I feel like I can't.  This is too small.  No.  I don't know how to measure out my ingredients.  No.  So I start shoving it in.  It's easy.  It's 50% leafy greens, 50% fruit, and then a quarter cup, or for me, an eighth of a cup,  of a boost.  Stop with the fruit.  Just stop with the boost.  They suggest a booster.  You don't need a booster.  Just eat vegetables.  My booster is oatmeal.  Drink the fucking vegetables.  My boost is chia seeds.  I don't think it's very flavorful without... 
[02:40:00]  Yeah, a little lemon or a little ginger is what I flavor these things.  I don't fuck around with too much banana, orange.  It's all sugar.  Yeah, but Sam, GH has a man-sized drink.  Thank you, Kenny.  That's right.  Well, you ate a banana last night, right?  Oh.  I have one with my protein shake.  Oh, no.  Eric is coming in with his NutriBullet.  Welcome to the show, Eric.  By the way, this would have been Dr. Ian Smith's plugs for his blender, but there's  still being...  Well, tough shit.  It's time to start talking about the NutriBullet.  Dr. Ian Smith has a handle on his.  You've got a cup. 
[02:40:30]  It comes with three different cups, and they're each represented on the show today.  Well, I've put in mind some Jolly Ranchers.  Exactly.  Twizzlers.  What is that?  A fucking...  A used tampon.  That is really blood red.  A pulpy tampon.  Obviously, his booster is Jelly Donuts.  Look how red yours is.  It really is red.  What is that?  Did you just go overboard with the greens today?  No, this is the first time I was trying to dress a beets.  This is beets, yeah.  And what else?  I hate eating beets, but I'll put beets in a juice any day. 
[02:41:00]  A good beet salad, home run.  I hate eating beets.  I love a beet.  I'll drink a good beet, though.  I think there's kale in it, too, but it's mostly...  It's beet, a little bit of fruit.  What kind of fruit?  I don't remember.  I've got to look in the...  We made it last night, but it's in the book.  Is there a booster in yours?  No, no booster.  You've got to go with the boost.  You've got to have a boost.  Wait, how do you make this shit?  It's just like a fucking regular blender?  No.  No, a magic bullet.  The blender is pretty much this piece with the blades, so you could clean it much easier 
[02:41:30]  instead of digging all the way in to try to clean blades.  It's a blender upside down.  It's amazing.  My cleanup is less than 20 seconds.  I've never used blenders before because the cleanup was a nightmare every single time.  It's like an infomercial.  I used a big cup on the weekends.  Make sure you at mention NutriBullet.  Thank you.  I used a big cup on the weekends.  They're really happy that I sold them a lot of blenders.  Oh, shit.  Drink it nice and slow.  Plugola should be fucking amazing from these guys.  They should probably advertise at our show.  We've sold a lot of them. 
[02:42:00]  They don't need to.  True.  Well, I'll stop talking about it, and then maybe they'll advertise.  But the book says, my pocket nutrition book said, you do 50% leafy greens, 50% fruits,  and a boost.  But he doesn't know fruit.  What do you mean I don't know fruit?  We were talking about oranges this morning.  You didn't know what a navel orange was.  You just get an orange.  Who the fuck doesn't know what a navel orange is?  Wait.  Hold on.  What kind of orange?  Hold on.  Could you turn this off? 
[02:42:30]  Sure.  Okay.  Say navel orange.  I'm going to fucking hit a home run.  Oh, okay.  Turn it back on.  It's on.  So what kind of orange did you have?  Well, I didn't.  I didn't.  Opie didn't tell me because I don't know exactly what a navel orange is.  I bet the Marines don't eat it.  It's just so unfunny. 
[02:43:00]  I love the setup.  It takes forever.  Chip.  I love it.  I don't think the payoff was worth it?  No.  It was poorly timed, too.  Yeah.  You just spit it out immediately.  Cloddering over the setup.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, yeah. 
[02:43:30]  Let's say hi to Justin in Ohio.  Justin?  Opie, my man.  What's up, Justin?  Hey, actually, I just wanted to share a little bit of information.  I'm from the Philippines.  I immigrated here when I was about 10 in the 90s.  And it is true that Filipinos who live there have this idea that Filipinos who emigrate out of the Philippines into America are millionaires.  Most recently, my uncle, my family back home, they live in a region that is very dense with Muslims, very prepared people. 
[02:44:00]  And they kidnapped my uncle and tried to extort $3 million out of us.  Like, we're not that rich.  And, yeah, that's about it.  Hi, Jimmy.  All right, Justin.  Thank you, sir.  I was out of that.  I was out of that.  It was an amazing story.  I came in halfway through.  I regained attention to that call, and I was lost. 
[02:44:30]  That's your loss?  I know.  That was a great one.  So Aya wants a $300 dress.  No, she would prefer something slightly more expensive than $300.  But she's willing to accept a $300 dress.  But Louis is insisting.  Because they've got to stay on budget.  I like the couple of them.  This one, maybe.  Isn't that pretty?  Yeah.  It's original price of $600.  Oh.  I'm sure Aya will look beautiful in anything that she tries on.  But in a store like this, I'm afraid she's going to forget about the budget. 
[02:45:00]  A store like this?  A store like this?  A wedding dress store?  $300 dresses?  A $600 wedding dress, that's not a store like this.  No.  They go for tens of thousands of dollars in some of these joints.  Louis finds out they're going over budget.  I feel beautiful in this dress.  And I think this is the one I want.  Okay, so she found a dress.  Okay.  It's beautiful.  Okay.  It's over. 
[02:45:30]  It's over.  I'm going to break it up.  The veil, $75.  All of her alterations, $125 altogether.  Yeah, we'll definitely have to talk more about that.  I really wanted the dress.  And it's frustrating and hurtful when Louis isn't happy about how much something costs.  And he just shut down without asking my opinion.  I mean, this is my wedding too.  So it's going to be $500 total. 
[02:46:00]  $300 for the dress.  And then the veil and the alterations are another $200, right?  Yes, that makes it $500.  And Louis is like...  That's beyond reasonable.  Oh my God.  Do you know...  This is what an old lady I'm turning into.  What?  Now, I wouldn't actually pursue this.  But I will be honest.  I thought of it.  When they were having trouble over the wedding dress, I did think, I'd be happy to send the money.  Oh, Jimmy.  That'd be nice.  I did think of it.  Yeesh.  I know.  The whole reason you watch the show is because eventually the guys will be crying and alone. 
[02:46:30]  Right.  That's why you watch.  That's not why I watch.  You'll feel better about yourself watching other people fail.  Right.  No, you see, I want to see them get married and be very happy together.  Because they're doing things we've all done, but they're doing it later in life than we do.  Right.  Right.  What do you mean we did?  What have I done?  I haven't done any of this stuff.  You've never been a sap to a girl?  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  But you're acting like this is their first time being a sap.  No.  This is probably the least sappy they've ever been. 
[02:47:00]  They're all batting out of their league.  Yeah.  Well, that's why this show is wonderful.  It's just a barrel of monkeys.  So now Lewis has to tell Aya, Aya, whatever.  Aya.  Whatever.  You can tell me every time.  I know.  That he can't afford the dress.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Why are they even, like, attempting to buy wedding dresses, then?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  So the ceremony space is between $25 and $50.  The room rental is $100.  What do you mean the space is $25 to $50? 
[02:47:30]  I was trying to figure that out, too.  Because, I mean, unless it's that per head, which it can't be.  No, it would definitely not be.  A wedding venue for $50?  What are they talking about here?  He said a room.  The room is $25 to $50.  You know, I always wondered if he meant per head, too, when he said that.  But that's way too...  That's an expensive wedding if it's $25, $50 a head.  Wait.  Isn't?  No, it ain't.  Or wait.  No, it's not expensive, but it's...  It's expensive for his...  Oh, yeah. 
[02:48:00]  Wait, no, $50 a head is expensive?  No, it's not.  Well, it would be expensive for this guy.  Yeah.  He could mean for the whole venue.  It's expensive if you're trying to buy a $300 wedding dress.  Right.  Okay, so the ceremony space is between $25 and $50.  Oh, the ceremony space!  Oh.  So wherever they're getting married, it's going to cost $25 and $50.  Just to get married, just like the room they're in.  Oh!  Just to use that space.  The church, probably. 
[02:48:30]  Church likes a little action.  A little pay-off.  And church likes a little taste when you do stuff in there.  $35 under the table, you're married.  Right.  Holy fuck, he's...  All right.  Okay, so the ceremony space is between $25 and $50.  The room rental is $100.  As far as a flower shop goes, I know those flowers are expensive, but I'm certain we can  find them for cheap or somewhere else.  Oh.  The wedding is important to me, but of course I have to understand also, you know, that 
[02:49:00]  we don't have that much money.  Ha!  Whoops.  How about we get home?  She said that it was $125 for alterations.  I still think that that veil is awfully expensive.  $75.  I don't think we don't have the money to pay for the dress right now.  In a couple weeks, because I just had to pay rent and stuff like that, so in a couple 
[02:49:30]  weeks, it'll be slightly different.  She's like, I could have gotten this in the Philippines.  Yeah.  But since she can only hold it until the end of business today, there's no guarantee  that that same dress will be there.  Were you crying at this point, Jimmy?  I was not fucking researching where to send your money.  Where could I send money for the dress?  No, let's not act like I'm a big old panty sissy boy, although not as far off as I'd like 
[02:50:00]  to believe.  No, I felt this was slightly manipulated and set up by the TLC people.  I don't know.  To make them look worse.  Why?  That's a cheap dress.  Because when he said something, it was almost like he was trying to make her cry.  Because he was saying, well, they said they can only handle it until the end of today.  Right.  It was just a weird way of wording it that I didn't necessarily buy.  But can you imagine flying in from the Philippines and being like, wait, you need to wait until 
[02:50:30]  your rent check clears before I can get a wedding dress?  Yeah, I'm getting rich American guy.  What happened?  I'm going to help raise your stupid fat kids.  The least you could do is spend $300 on a wedding dress and $35 on a veil.  One of them's got a mohawk.  Right.  For God's sake.  Give me something.  You know what I'm going to be dealing with?  Yeah.  Give me my really cheap wedding.  They just wrestle each other all the time.  I wonder what fucking CB and the Russian girl are doing, though.  What does CB stand for?  Siggy breath.  Siggy breath.  Suck down that Siggy and then go for a kiss. 
[02:51:00]  Siggy breath.  We're going to do their clips next.  Reeking of Siggy's.  Lewis realizes he needs to change things up.  I want to make sure that you have the flowers and the dress because you've already sacrificed  a lot.  Oh.  Please, get out of shape.  To come all the way out here and to be with me. 
[02:51:30]  So I'm going to do everything I can to make sure that your dress and your flowers are as  close as possible.  Okay.  I've invested my heart and soul into Aya and I just want her to be happy.  I had no idea until now that Aya was this upset. 
[02:52:00]  And if I want to keep her in my life, I've got to turn this around.  I've got to turn this around.  Keep your chin up.  She should have listened.  I mean, Aya was saying that she wanted a certain kind of dress.  That's fair.  How's he going to turn it around?  Fuck her in her dress.  Huh?  Slap something on her.  Yeah.  Aya can't afford his Philippines bride.  What's he going to do to turn it around?  He's going to get a new job that pays more money.  It's unbelievable. 
[02:52:30]  If he could do that, he probably would have already done that.  Filipinos come cheap, right?  You'd think so.  What the fuck?  It's not a Russian.  This guy can't fucking afford anything.  Nothing.  Nothing.  This guy needs to concentrate less on finding some fucking mail order bride and pleasing  her and concentrate a little more on your own personal fucking career choice.  He's paying support, too.  Don't forget two boys.  I was going to say, in all fairness, we do have to stick up for him a little bit because  I guarantee that wife gets her taste.  How about instead of a Filipino bride? 
[02:53:00]  She gets a nice big taste.  Huh?  Instead of a Filipino bride, open a 401k and just relax for a second.  He should go on the lam as a deadbeat dad for a few years, stock up some cash.  Like if you afford the $300 wedding dress.  $300?  I don't think they come cheaper than that.  No way.  I can't imagine they do.  Dude, I don't buy shit in the wedding dress that Jess got wasn't even close to $300.  How much was it?  It was a ton of money.  How much?  I don't remember exactly.  More than $1,000?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, definitely. 
[02:53:30]  Oh, there's thousands.  She looks great in it, too.  There's thousands of dollars.  More than $2,000?  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  Wow.  You get off easy.  Two fat little ring bearers.  Wait, you just got more than two years?  Kids.  Little kids.  Fat little ring bearers walking down the aisle.  Elbowing each other.  Being all rambunctious.  Yeah.  Stupid, sugared out.  More than $2,500?  Ah, tens of thousands.  Whoa.  Not for mine.  They're crazy.  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  And we didn't even go crazy, crazy.  Oh, yeah. 
[02:54:00]  Wedding dresses very rarely look good.  It's just a wedding dress.  When you look at a wedding dress, you don't go like, wow, that's a right dress.  I've been to a million weddings like everybody else.  Can you tell them apart?  No.  They all look really nice in their wedding dresses.  Absolutely.  But I couldn't tell you, and I've run the gamut over the years of expensive weddings and cheap  weddings, and they all look within range of each other.  Yeah.  So close.  Absolutely.  Dumb song.  Please welcome Mr. and Mrs. 
[02:54:30]  They've been fucking for years.  Yeah.  Don't worry about it.  Yeah, exactly.  Stuck in her ass two weeks ago.  Please welcome for the very first time.  Right.  I think my wife got her fucking wedding dress up like Sid's pants in the mall.  Sid's pants.  But it's probably more than three.  Who cares?  Did she have a dress?  Yeah, but it was just a wedding dress.  No.  It wasn't a wedding dress.  It was a fucking dress. 
[02:55:00]  Where'd you go to the jeweler for the engagement ring?  Penn Station.  Had a jewelry store.  Nice.  Right?  Yeah, I just fucking...  How much?  Got a ring.  I don't know.  It was about 800 bucks.  More than that would have thought.  Oh, please.  That's not like Penn Station bucks.  It would have been 250 anywhere else.  Exactly.  Exactly.  I don't care.  Do you regret getting married?  Everything's worth it.  I don't mind so much now because it's been great material for the show.  But, uh...  Oh, boy.  Would you ever do it again? 
[02:55:30]  No.  I shan't wed again.  Boy, you gotta get one of these mail orders.  We can play it out on a radio show.  Oh, how great.  Yeah.  Happy.  Get a little curling for yourself.  This is great.  We'll hear it at the radio station.  Then day 89, you tell her to beat it.  Take a hike.  I'll call you a fucking cab.  Hit the bricks, rooski.  You're not welcome.  Yes, not welcome.  You see this?  It means not welcome.  It's an American flag.  Picture Ronald Reagan. 
[02:56:00]  See this?  Dude, you gotta.  You don't like exotic for the most part.  Nah.  You might have to go rooski.  I would have to go either rooski.  Right.  Or some other, you know, European nation.  Even South African would be nice.  Yeah.  Like those white South African women.  Oh, let's do this.  They're pretty hot.  Day 89.  Hey, lol.  It'll be a wonderful day.  That'll be fun.  Right.  Oh, yeah.  What the...  Very good.  Day 89. 
[02:56:30]  Are you excited for our wedding?  Get the fuck out.  Hit it, sister.  That would be a good bet.  We should do that.  We should totally destroy someone's life and dreams.  Like we haven't done that before?  Where have you been?  Yes.  At least going into it, we'll know we're doing that.  That is true.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and then we're going to get into Siggy Breath and his Russian...  Siggy Breath.  Soon-to-be bride, possibly.  They're actually local? 
[02:57:00]  Siggy Breath and his bride?  Cleveland?  No.  No, no, no, no, no.  They were spotted in Atlantic City.  What were they doing?  Oh, were they?  What?  I don't know what they were doing, but apparently there's some kind of a show on sale at the  Borgata.  Plug time!  Oh.  I will be...  My third show is still on sale.  The other two are sold out February 15th.  Pittsburgh, February 28th at Carnegie Music Hall.  And I've just added the Virginia Beach Funny Bone, March 27th through 29th.

Hey, Jenna, you there?  Hi, how are you?  Uh, I'm doing fine.  And Bobo Man's getting hard hearing the sound of your voice, Jenna.  Sexy!  I'm just thinking about you.  Just thinking about pounding you, right? 
[03:07:00]  It's pounding you.  Pounding you in the ass.  Yeah, it's very tail-hitting.  And what are you looking for, Jenna, huh?  Nowadays, I'm so single and so in need of a man.  Ah, well, if you're looking for a man, then you're talking to the right person.  I just like to have sex.  Oh, well, you want sex?  Ham, you'll get it, baby.  I got my hand on the boat boner. 
[03:07:30]  It's there just waiting for you.  It should be huge.  Oh, it is.  Three and a half inches there just waiting for you.  Oh, yummy.  You want me to make you happy, Jenna?  You happy?  I'm bummed.  I'm super bummed.  Ooh, I like that.  What has you down?  Um, I have, uh, uh, bad acts.  Tell me more.  Oh, yeah, I have a lot of things going on, but, you know, my main priority are my kids. 
[03:08:00]  What else is wrong?  I just want to, um, make sure that I am with my kids.  Oh, God, I want to be inside you, Jenna.  That's the thing, is I feel like, um, you know, I'll get on Twitter, because I'll get mad, and I'll be like, rah, and go crazy on Twitter, and people will think I'm nuts. 
[03:08:30]  But, in reality, it's really just me trying to tell people what is really happening.  Oh, man, here comes the pree.  And I haven't seen my kids for a very, very long time.  Um, I'm able to see them only two days a week, and, um, they charge me $400 an hour.  Like, people don't know me. 
[03:09:00]  That was good.  Thanks, Jenna.  Come here, Mr. Maloon again.  Daddy has something that needs cleaning.  After 20 years, you would want a break, too.  But the guys are back now, in charge.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, on Sirius XM.  What?  My eyes are itchy.  Might be the crazy glue in my mouth.  I had to glue in another tooth.  Ouch.  That was before, when we were eating. 
[03:09:30]  I fit into a piece of bacon, I think, and it, like, it wedged in between the temporary  and the real tooth.  Right.  And kind of wedged it open, like, when you split a log, only half of it.  Ah, it was painful.  We might have to send you out to pasture with Scott Shannon.  No.  This continues.  Thursday, I get the permanents.  I hope.  It was supposed to be last week, and then one of them wasn't fitting, probably.  My dentist is very meticulous, and noticed a little bit of space between my gum and the 
[03:10:00]  laminate.  So, she said, no, they're all getting sent back, and getting a new mold made, and new  things.  So, Thursday, hopefully, I'll have this finally fucking done, because I've had it with these  temporaries.  Last night, I inadvertently grabbed a piece of plastic again, something wrapped in plastic,  and used my teeth to rip it open.  Right.  You don't realize how often you just do that, and it made, like, this crackling sound.  But why do you keep forgetting that you have, like... 
[03:10:30]  It's absolutely like flipping a light switch on in a blackout.  It's just out of habit.  It's just out of habit.  You don't even think about it.  You don't think about it.  You don't remember when the teeth are sitting in water next to your bedside?  See, young Sam, the teeth don't sit in water.  They are not dentures.  These are temporary laminates, until the permanent ones are made and put on.  And then those will be in the water.  No, my teeth are still under this.  Who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who, who left the teeth behind on Friday? 
[03:11:00]  Woof, woof, woof.  Was that real?  No, those teeth have been here forever.  Oh.  Whose are they?  Some dentist came in a while back and left them.  Oh.  Interesting.  I didn't realize.  Oh, big A's dentist, maybe.  Oh, boy.  That guy should get a medal of honor.  No kidding.  Noble, noble peace prize.  Going in there.  Wow.  Ew, ew, ew, ew. 
[03:11:30]  James.  Get that stuck in your head.  Jimmy loves that song.  What?  Ho, ho, ho, ho.  Oh, yes.  Who are you?  Who, who, who?  I like when songs get stuck in people's heads.  What?  Is Edgar's song stuck in your head?  No.  No, that one didn't really stick.  How does it go?  I'm not going to say it now.  Okay, good.  Let's move on to 90 Day Fiancé.  Who are you?  Okay, good.  We're looking at episode four, now that Jim Norton's a huge fan of 90 Day Fiancé. 
[03:12:00]  I really am, and I didn't want to be, because I principle hate reality shows, but I couldn't  be dishonest.  It was entertaining.  Yeah.  Yeah, it is entertaining.  And I know that they adjust.  When you say stuff like the dress and stuff, like they have to build, or like, hey, let  me take you to a tailgate thing.  A reality show has to have something for people to do.  Right.  Because we all think, like the Osbournes, they could film for weeks and weeks and weeks,  and the cut down costs.  Most people don't have that much shit we do on a daily basis that's interesting.  Like, me in front of the computer is good.  You watching the kids, or you going home to your, like, that stuff's good once in a 
[03:12:30]  while, but then they're like, all right, what's happening that's new that, so they have  to create shit?  It's, uh, what do they call it?  Reality.  They call it a sister reality.  Sister reality.  Right.  Yes.  Because they don't have the time anymore.  Well, I think most people just don't have enough interesting stuff happening.  Right.  Again, unless you're doing rock shows, what else are you doing?  These shows, they film in, like, just weeks at the end.  Yeah, they film so much shorter.  Although 90 days, but I bet you they only come around, like, you know.  A couple times a week or something.  Yeah, or every other week or something.  Yeah, I love when they do these shows, and then they talk. 
[03:13:00]  It's like, we're on our 10th season.  Right.  It's like they've been on for two months.  Right.  What are you talking about?  Well, we say hi to Mike and Aziza once again.  Mike's from Cleveland.  He loves Siggy's.  He's never met a Siggy he didn't like.  Right.  And Aziza, when she smiles, is very hot, but she doesn't smile a lot.  And she doesn't like to eat food in front of anyone.  And she doesn't like to drink alcohol.  And she hates Mike's Siggy breath.  Yeah, she doesn't appear to like Mike, actually. 
[03:13:30]  Right.  It doesn't.  I don't really see any romance there whatsoever.  No.  A romantic connection.  I think she likes him, but I think the sexual attraction is probably hard for her.  Um, because she doesn't seem like she's very sexual.  Like, she's probably one of those cold, doesn't, she doesn't seem like she likes fucking a lot.  Or she just wants to come to America, Jimmy.  That's possible?  I mean.  That's a biggie.  That's possible.  I'm not saying it's not possible, but.  I think America's still a big get for a lot of people around the world.  That is a big get.  I'd bury her. 
[03:14:00]  So, you know, you deal with Siggy breath for a little while to get your ass in America.  Right.  All I'm thinking is how much I'd love, I'm debating getting one of these girls.  Wow.  And I'm on such a fucking run of just worthless cunts.  Worthless cunts.  Just worthless cunts.  Like, it's time to find a nice person.  It's time to go look overseas?  Yeah.  I want to go on a fucking computer.  Fiddle it, fiddle it, fiddle it.  Right.  Hello, Jimmy Norton.  Yeah, we had this stupid poster click off. 
[03:14:30]  I like the Jimmy.  It's very funny.  Go to a comedy club.  Then let's do it with you.  Let's do this.  Let's get Jimmy on one of these websites.  Yeah.  That'd be great.  At least play it out.  Then it'll be up to Jimmy to figure out if he wants to actually go through with it or  not and bring one of these broads to a medical.  Right.  I still have to go there first.  They'll probably set me up.  Cut my throat.  Oh, that could happen.  Take my pin code.  I'm not going to get a fucking Brazilian.  I'm not going to get an Aziza. 
[03:15:00]  You're not going to the fucking Mexican cartels for these girls.  I'm not going to get a fucking Curalea, whatever her name is.  Why haven't we punched up a site here in front of us so we can see what some of these girls  look like?  Yeah, let's do that, Sam.  Let's look at some of these girls, Sam.  You could start shopping today, maybe, Jimmy.  Mail order brides.  Curalea.  You could definitely get...  Not Asian.  You could definitely get an A, yeah.  Oh, exactly.  I get an A here.  Russian women.  Here we go.  Russian women want to meet you. 
[03:15:30]  Jim, look who they want to meet.  Globalladies.com.  You.  Oh.  Whoa.  See?  They're talking to you.  Yes, look at...  Which one you want, Jimmy?  Look at the old god.  I won't go with the Russian girl.  They don't turn me on.  What about Tatiana?  She'll turn you on.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Tatiana.  Tatiana.  You're playing.  Cut right.  Cut right.  We'll do nothing for me.  You don't think these are the actual broads?  There might actually be.  There's no way these are the actual broads.  No.  No way.  Some of them might be Russian strippers or hookers.  Stop, Jimmy.  No.  Some of these photos were taken in the mid-90s. 
[03:16:00]  There's no way these are the actual broads.  Mid-90s.  It's like...  A little bait and switch is about to happen.  All right.  What country would you like a girl from, Jimmy?  I don't know.  What about Brazil?  Great Britain.  Great Britain.  Canadian chick.  Now, they're pussies.  I hate their pussies.  What's wrong with Canadian chick pussies?  Nothing.  My experience has been everyone I've gotten has smelled like fucking...  Has smelled like a sink water.  Wow.  Seriously?  I haven't gotten any good ones. 
[03:16:30]  Dude, I just fucking...  It's amazing.  Seriously?  Yep.  Don't like them.  I haven't gotten any good ones.  Canadian broads don't...  They don't wash their pussies?  No, no.  I don't think it's that they're dirty.  Just the ones I've gotten have not been good.  Wow.  It probably has something to do with that maple syrup.  Probably kind of leaks.  You think it's maple syrup leaking out?  Just leaking into the system.  And fermenting.  Right.  Just fermented.  What are these girls?  I'm going to blame it on the maple syrup.  Oh, these look like some real girls right here.  Rosebrides.com.  All right.  This is more of a speech. 
[03:17:00]  Where are they from?  Oh, Christ.  Oh, here you go.  Jimmy, here you go now.  These are getters.  You really thought those pictures were real?  This is a real sight.  Yeah.  Look at these monsters.  Who's Anastasia?  Anastasia is pretty.  She's all right.  We're looking at 18 to 20 right now.  Punch up Anastasia.  She's 19.  Where's she from, though?  Russia, right?  Moscow.  She's Russian.  Jimmy, come on.  Moscow.  Let me see, though.  I would date a Russian girl if I thought she was sincere.  Yeah.  And yeah, this is some fucking knockout smart Russian girl.  There you go.  She looks pretty nice, right? 
[03:17:30]  Right.  She's calm, easygoing, flexible, and open-minded.  I am from Moscow.  I am seeking man.  You know what open-minded means, right?  Yep.  She'll cut you.  Right in the old shitter.  But she's looking for a guy 22 to 30.  Yeah, yeah.  I want a girl that's like 25.  I'm 45 right now.  That's all right.  All right.  20, 25.  There you go.  Sammy.  Go 20, 25.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  Wait, wait, whoa.  Hold on.  Who do you like?  Wait. 
[03:18:00]  Nazgulia.  Oh, for Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan.  Oh, good.  Nazgulia.  I'm starting to see a lot more girls that look like they take your order down at the  Jade King.  She's cute.  Let's see.  What is she looking for, a guy between her?  Her face is mushy.  Well, she's saying man 28 to 32.  28 to 32.  Yeah, but second picture, look a little fat there.  Uh-oh.  Is that her?  Oh, good.  You've got to sign up for Rose Bride's account.  Wow, she does look a little chubby right there.  Goodbye to this website. 
[03:18:30]  Look, if you want one of these young broads to like a 45-year-old, you're going to have  to go like Asian.  What?  You're going to have to go like Thailand or Philippines.  You can't go completely out of your fucking zone.  You're going to have to.  What about Minsk?  Minsk, go for that girl.  She's 29.  Here?  Yeah, she's probably a little older.  She's live.  Let me see.  From Minsk.  Oh, wow.  She wants 32 to 39, Jimmy.  Yeah, good for her with that fucking weird looking head of hers.  Psychotic doll face.  Go back.  Fuck her.  How about the one on the right? 
[03:19:00]  She has a pretty smile.  She does look like the girl from The Orphan.  Yeah, she's fucking pretty.  I just don't see the 90 Day Fiancee guys doing it this way.  Why?  Come on, go to her, Sam.  I think they might have.  Google Chrome fucking stinks.  No, but beating the shit out of the broads is what I mean.  I like the second thing, their age isn't like Jimmy's bracket.  Compatible?  Jimmy just starts bashing them.  Google Chrome is the...  Stop with Google Chrome.  Fuck Google Chrome.  There she is.  What about Kat...  Katarina.  It's Katarina.  Katarina.  Let me see.  Hold on.  Well, she's kind, energetic, romantic.  What else is she going to say? 
[03:19:30]  30 to 40.  Sorry.  I'm slightly cunty.  30 to 40.  You're out, Jimmy.  Nah, it's fine.  You might talk her into it.  You might have to go old broad.  She's looking for a Swiss man.  Go 40 to 50.  Swiss.  What are you doing?  Go 40 to 50.  We're going 40 to 50 for you, Jimmy.  That's a little easier.  There you go.  This is Moyer's feet.  She needs a guy with a pocket knife with a spoon on it.  This is perfect.  There you go.  Swiss army knife.  Oh.  Tundee.  Tundee's perfect for you.  Tundee.  Tundee from the past. 
[03:20:00]  What a great name.  Tundee.  She's big and fat.  From Hungary.  She is hungry all the time.  I would only cheer the best, you know, Sammy.  She's not from Hungary.  That's her status.  Profile.  They give them profile ratings.  Two and a half out of six stars.  Absolutely.  2.7 out of six.  But she'll cook a good meal for you, Jimmy.  Go back.  I'm blimping me.  Hungarian gulash.  Go back.  Yeah, exactly.  Who else do you want from this category?  None.  Oh, my God.  There you go.  Look at this pie face. 
[03:20:30]  What is that?  Let's go to Ho Chi Minh.  Now, let's see if you're from Texas there.  You need an old Vietnamese broad.  Let's click on that picture.  Yeah.  Someone that could tell you great old sniper stories.  Yeah.  Picking off American GIs.  Here you go.  Look, she's got glamour shots, Jimmy.  I can't see them.  Those are glamour shots.  Those are some nice glamour shots.  Beautiful.  Oh, crumb thigh.  Thigh.  Oh, look at that.  She's looking for a man 50 to 65.  All right.  She wants to be the younger spring chick. 
[03:21:00]  47?  47?  I want to be friends with her.  Oh.  This is an attractive girl.  You see how her hair is thinning right at the top there?  Yeah, that's a nice blonde smile she's got there.  Oh, God bless her.  What was that?  A few speckles of napalm that hit her when she was running down that road?  You might remember me from...  Yes.  I've watched so many photos.  Damn.  All right.  Well, we're going to work on this.  You can't go out of your zone, though, and go like that.  So why don't we talk about Mike and Aziza from 90 Day Fiance.  Aziza tells Mike he can't have strippers at his bachelor party. 
[03:21:30]  They're in the bachelor party stage, this couple?  Yeah, but their bachelor parties are like...  Come on.  Mike's going to go to a bar with his dad, and then Aziza's going to go to a bar with Mike's mom.  And Mike's mom likes to throw him back.  Oh, she does.  Oh, does she?  When she gets a few in her, man...  What was that famous line from those newscasters?  When you get a few belts in you...  Oh, yeah.  You go home and do a shooter.  You come back here with a different lady.  Well, this is a different lady after a few shooters, and boy, did she tell Aziza what 
[03:22:00]  she thinks of her.  However, the editing on the fucking promos for that was very bad.  Tricky, right?  Very tricky.  Yeah, very tricky.  Very deceiving, because they make it look like her and Aziza have a moment that they  don't actually have.  Right.  Ah-ha.  Completely different reason why she was crying.  They do that.  Right.  It's really nice to finally be intimate with the woman I'm going to marry.  Fuck this.  I just feel like me and Mike are really getting closer.  It's very nice.  What's she doing? 
[03:22:30]  So they finally fucked?  Yeah, she let him put it in.  What happened was this?  Mike was hanging out, of course.  What else doing?  I'm having a ciggy outside a bar.  It's what he does.  Yeah, a couple of other ciggy girls came up to him.  Yeah, obviously so set up by the producers.  Ask him for a ciggy, and then they film the girl walking, Aziza's coming, and fucking,  you know, old fucking old chimney is puffing away with two fives, and the nine walks down  the street and realizes, oh no, fat ciggy breath is puffing away with two fives, and 
[03:23:00]  she gets jealous, quote unquote, and that night she decides to overlook the fact that he  goes to bed in white socks and gym shorts and has ciggy breath, and says, I can't wait  to fuck this guy.  She kind of saw her visa going down the shitter.  She saw her dream of coming to America going away.  Like, I cannot let these girls do this.  Right.  Yeah, but she's a cute girl, man.  She's very kissable on the cheek.  Yeah, you like her?  Yeah, I kind of like her.  You like kissing a good cheek?  I do, man.  If she doesn't get in the country, I'd certainly bring her in for 90 days. 
[03:23:30]  She's a pinkish hue.  Because you proposed to her?  I don't know about proposing to her, but I mean, just I'll tell her, like, yeah, we'll  get married.  And I'll spend the last time in fucking 90 days just eating that asshole.  Nice.  All right.  What are you doing?  Looking at the dresses.  Do you like this one?  Sure.  I didn't see a shirt or anything, right?  That's nice.  Funny wedding definitely puts a lot of pressure on a relationship. 
[03:24:00]  Do you want to have a stripper on the bachelor party?  It's not really up to me.  It's up to my friends.  Oh.  I love how he tries to still be, like, a man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  A man, like...  But then he does that lovey-dovey talk shit.  And he doesn't actually take culpability.  He's like, well, it's up to my friend.  His sadness is right under his skin, but he tries to, like, oh, I'm a man, and of  course, you know, we're going to have strippers, and it's not up to me, so they set up my 
[03:24:30]  bachelor party with strippers, and the pussies are in my face.  Hey, I didn't set this shit up.  And I'll tell you something.  I think every guy is guilty of the cutesy fucking talk with the girl.  Sure.  You know, but you don't put that on television.  You don't do it in front of people.  It's fucking...  You know, when he's there going, how do you do it?  It's TV, baby.  You just fucking shut up.  Why don't you cave his head in?  Oh, he talks to her like that all the time when they were in bed. 
[03:25:00]  Even when they were getting into bed.  Hi, what are you doing?  I'm kissing you.  Baby.  Yeah, shut the fuck up.  And it's especially bad when it's not reciprocal.  Like when you're going like, yeah.  I'm just giving you kisses.  And she goes, why are you doing that?  Stop with the fag voice.  Why do you think that brushing your teeth takes away the ciggy smell when it's in your beard and hair and on your fingers?  Why do you cup my face smelling like ashtray fingers?  You need to dip yourself in Purell, ciggy boy. 
[03:25:30]  But I just had one ciggy.  Fuck you.  If they want to organize one, then...  Oh, really?  That's how it works?  Shoopy.  If there's going to be a stripper, you're going to have a blood dance for sure.  Guys in Russia probably don't do that.  At the bachelor party, you have your fiancé.  She's the only girl you're supposed to see naked.  Oh, really?  I can't control what my friends do.  You can't?  No. 
[03:26:00]  Then you're just going to have to be okay with it.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, I can maybe offer some suggestions, but...  I mean, you can get drunk.  I mean, whatever.  But nothing else.  You're not the boss of me.  Putting a bunch of russes out of business.  That's what the best party is for.  That's the last time you're not the boss of me.  You're not the boss of me.  You know, I wouldn't cheat on you or anything.  This is very forced dialogue.  At the end of the day, I still come home to you.  Long day of getting blown by other chicks.  But at the end of the day...  He even says, you're not the boss of me, and then quickly recovers to be like... 
[03:26:30]  Wait, the bachelor party's the last time?  You are going to be the boss of me?  Yeah, yeah.  Of course.  He doesn't want girls at the bachelor party.  He don't care about that.  Let's say hi to Dustin in Houston.  Dustin.  Well, so what if you're doing that?  You should be vacuuming, too.  Dustin.  Hey.  Hey, nigga.  What's up?  Oh, hi.  No, I hate that you guys have introduced the phrase,  ciggy breath.  That's Jimmy.  I can't watch a single episode with that bald-headed dunce 
[03:27:00]  without thinking about his ciggy fucking breath.  Ciggy breath is atrocious.  Male pattern baldness and ciggy breath.  Very good, brother.  Thank you.  Funny.  So now we're at the bachelor party.  The bachelorette party.  Ooh.  And Mike's mom gets a few shooters in her,  and boy, she's finally ready to talk.  What a shithole I took this girl to for a big bachelorette party.  Right.  Just a local dive bar.  Four cranky chicks at a fucking TGI Friday's bar. 
[03:27:30]  Whatever the fuck it is.  How awful.  I don't think his mom likes me very much,  and I'm kind of worried how tonight it's going to go.  These are going to cut loose and have some fun.  Wow.  Oh, come on.  You have to sip more than that much.  Oh, whatever my ass.  Drink some more of that.  Does she have a lisp?  Yeah.  Sounds like it.  She's a little drunk, too. 
[03:28:00]  Yeah, look at my son's marries.  Oh, my son's.  Oh, no.  I didn't even notice that.  I didn't either.  My son's.  My son's.  He's got a Marion going.  Oh, I didn't notice, Jimmy.  Good call.  I can't watch this.  I love it.  Oh, boy, do I enjoy a good lisp. 
[03:28:30]  Oh, I can't get it.  It's so much fun.  It's enraging.  Such that.  I don't think his mom likes me very much,  and I'm kind of worried how tonight it's going to go.  These have been cut loose and have some fun.  Wow.  Oh, come on.  You have to sip more than that much.  Oh, whatever.  Oh, whatever, my ass.  Drink some more of that. 
[03:29:00]  Oh, I mean, my son's marries are crazy.  Is she like.  She sounds like Chip.  She's got a Chip of Marion going.  My fucking son's getting married.  Oh, she said sip.  Sip.  Sip.  Fucking.  Sip.  Fuck yeah.  Oh, my son's marrying that crazy woman.  Can't trust her. 
[03:29:30]  I figured it out.  Yeah?  The plan.  The plan.  I'm going to go to America and marry the guy.  And then the day of the day, I'm going to feed them all rat poison.  Jesus.  No.  That's funny.  Oh, yeah.  This mom is a treat.  Feed them all rat poison.  She's a treat, all right.  I will poison them.  Wow. 
[03:30:00]  Yeah.  And then, you know what?  She starts crying.  Oh, yeah.  Is it in this clip?  Yeah, but she starts crying also when she starts talking about how much she's in love.  Right.  Because the mom wants to prove, wants her to prove that she's really in love with her.  She says he's my best friend.  And you missed a clip where she said, why couldn't you get a guy in Russia?  Yeah.  The mom said that, too.  And that's not why she was crying.  Like, the previews indicated. 
[03:30:30]  Right.  It was because Aziza was saying that he's her best friend.  Right.  Despite the fact that we have to keep a bowl of vellamints by the bed because he is sucking down ciggies out the window.  What is it about Mike that you love?  Um, I think it was, like, um, the most, the most important thing for me, like, in a guy, is that he's, like, my best friend. 
[03:31:00]  And I'm, like, very, very comfortable with him.  And, like, we can talk about whatever without being embarrassed or, you know, just, like, I don't know.  He's my best friend.  It's the first time I've seen color cut with your face for a while.  Oh, my God.  Did you hear that sentence?  No.  You didn't hear that sentence?  I did not know.  Oh, boy.  Best friend.  I'm going to cry.  It's the first time I've seen color cut with your face for a while. 
[03:31:30]  Wow.  I don't want you to cry.  I don't want you to cry.  You're just showing me that you have feelings in your heart, you know?  Ugh, shut up, lady.  Ugh.  What a beast.  What a beast.  Feelings in your heart.  Fucking beast.  I want to marry Aziza.  Hey, people drastically change because they have a few shooters in them.  A few shooters.  You go home and do a few shooters. 
[03:32:00]  You come back.  You're not the same lady.  You're not the same lady.  Oh, you're a different lady.  And then what did she say?  Ah, fuck you, cocksucker.  Yeah, something like that.  Go upstairs and see whatever.  Yeah.  So, finally, we're at the final couple.  Yeah.  90 Day Fiance.  It's Alan and Kierdineum.  Kierdineum.  Oh, right.  Some people saying that the city she's from has a lot of people.  Oh, yeah?  But they set it up on the show that she's kind of isolated in Brazil, right? 
[03:32:30]  They're saying.  Yeah.  That she comes from a small town and she's unaware of anything going on.  She comes across extremely innocent and naive.  And Alan knows this.  But Alan also knows he's in L.A.  where there's a lot of opportunists.  And that this broad, you know, is now heading down the modeling road.  And he's losing his fucking mind.  And that's why he said, look, let's speed up and get married sooner than the 90 days.  The last thing he wants is for her to become self-aware. 
[03:33:00]  It's like as dangerous as a robot becoming self-aware.  Right, self-aware.  A hot chick who's with you.  Right.  And then she becomes self-aware that she's a hot chick.  It's like, no, that's it.  It's over.  There's no returning.  It's over.  No returning back to our old programming.  And there are the Mormons.  He's a Mormon, yes.  So he drops off this hot piece of ass at his parents' house.  And she has to live on the pull-out couch while his mom eats man sandwiches and tells his dad what to do.  It's like the fat mom and the skinny dad. 
[03:33:30]  See, you know, the fat mom just rules the roost.  Of course.  Oh, yeah.  But they are very nice, the Mormons.  Oh, my God.  No, but they are.  The mom is very nice, and I think she likes Kirliam.  You have no problem when she bites into a man's sandwich?  I'm not saying that the mom is not the most attractive of gals.  She loves giant sandwiches.  Who said she looked like Captain Kangaroo?  Anthony did.  I did.  Oh, you did.  I want to steal those credits.  So Alan tells Kirliam not to get her hopes up about modeling. 
[03:34:00]  Yes.  See, he's already trying to knock her down.  And all she's doing...  Because he's like, fuck.  He's like, fuck.  Why did they say she could be a model?  In this clip, all she's doing is driving to the model casting agency.  Yeah.  And so he's like, well, whatever you do, don't get your hopes up over this.  Oh, God.  Just give her some encouragement.  Exactly.  When Kirliam was getting her hair done as a trial for the wedding,  her stylist told her, you've got to model. 
[03:34:30]  After we sent in some headshots, they called in Kirliam for a consultation.  Remember what we talked about?  Don't get our hopes up.  Yeah.  No?  Yeah, don't try and really just curious.  Honestly, I'm more excited to walk her down the aisle and not the catwalk,  but I'll support her in whatever makes her happy.  I would like to see my photo.  It's a big time square.  Yeah? 
[03:35:00]  Oh, boy.  It's too far ahead.  Oh, God.  He's getting our hopes up.  I know!  What was that last part?  You're getting your hopes up.  Oh, he's panicking.  Like, she goes on.  They're quickly becoming my favorite couple.  Oh, mine by far.  Yeah, quickly.  Because he is panicking.  He's like, fuck, this is the only thing I was hoping wouldn't happen.  I want to see the switch go off in her head when she realizes.  Right.  It's starting.  Yeah.  No, it is starting.  Even she knows that when you have a girl who says, I want to be a model, I want to be  in the big lights, and I want my picture to be in Times Square, you have to say, I do 
[03:35:30]  too.  That'd be amazing.  I think you can do it.  She says that, and then you go home, and you see more hair falling out of your head.  And you're calling her.  She's in Milan.  She's doing a fucking shoot.  Right.  And there's nothing but gorgeous people around her at all times.  And you're back home like, how's the shoot going, honey?  And then you realize that your religious upbringing was all bullshit.  All bullshit. 
[03:36:00]  That you lost this supermodel, because mommy and daddy said not to put it in until you get  married.  One of those brushes on his sink that's just packed with hair.  He looks at that all depressed.  You were raised under a farce, and it made you lose a hot piece of ass.  I was out very late last night.  With professionals.  Fast forward, your mom is consoling you with one hand and eating a man sandwich with the  other.  She came and put down her man sandwich to console her son. 
[03:36:30]  There are plenty more fish in the sea, son.  If you'd excuse me, I've got to take a bite of sloppy joe.  Yeah, a little sloppy joe.  I think that...  Oh, Jimmy.  I don't even know.  I think that this girl is very loyal.  I don't think that she's going to go off and...  Oh, you're naive.  I think she's very loyal.  Maybe now.  Yeah.  No, but I think she will remain loyal.  She understands American stuff.  I think she loves this guy.  Absolutely not.  This girl's out...  Picture this girl's out on the beach, right? 
[03:37:00]  She's doing a bikini shoot for something.  Right.  And just prancing about the beach with other male models and other chick models and they're  partying and they're going to clubs.  And this guy...  She's going to go home to the religious guy?  Yeah.  To the religious guy to sleep in the parents' house again.  On the pullout?  You know what's...  Those lifestyles don't mesh.  Yes, they do.  Because she was crying about her mother missing her mother and her family.  She's very family-yout.  The drugs will stop that.  Well, you know what that means.  She's going to now go back to where she was from and do her modeling from there and fly 
[03:37:30]  to Milan from Brazil.  Exactly.  You know what's really...  She's not going to deal with another night of charades with Fatso and fucking charades  and the chubby chaser.  With the castrated father and the fucking fat mom.  Fatso and the chubby chaser.  You know what's really unattractive to girls who know they could get many, many dudes?  Yeah.  When the guy they're with is insecure and stomps on their dreams.  Right.  And the insecurity starts showing and there was a couple looks in Kierliam's eyes where 
[03:38:00]  she's like, wait a minute.  What's up with this?  And there was a, what's up with this?  You know, insecure he is with that.  And that nice poor hair.  When a breeze hits it, it looks like a dandelion.  When you blow on a dandelion.  Those dandelions...  You just blow away.  Those little kids blow on his head for good luck.  Yes.  They just fly off.  Those dandelions can hang in there a little bit.  Oh, yeah.  You know, a little bit.  A little bit at the end.  He's plucking his hair.  He's like, oh, she loves me. 
[03:38:30]  She loves me now.  She loves me now.  She loves me now.  I bet he's nervously twisting and pulling on his hair.  He plucks his eyebrows out.  Oh, yeah.  He plucks his eyebrows out.  Fast forward, he's going to have a Captain Kangaroo wig like his mom.  Yo, I'll have another Sloppy Joe mom.  Nasty, gnarly, bitten fingernails.  He's just nervous Nelly that she's leaving.  While the father sits there wondering when's the next time he gets to get suffocated by  the big fat vagina woman.  I'm feeling a little randy tonight, hon.  Oh, God.  Got to climb on top of that disaster. 
[03:39:00]  Well, I'm not.  My Ajit is bothering me.  Oh, okay.  She's got reflux burps.  Ajit.  From those Big Macs.  Yeah, exactly.  All that sauce.  She's cutting reflux gassers.  She's trying to eat her box.  She's got gout on both feet.  And her fucking neck.  She has gout neck.  Gout.  Yes.  While he's eating her out, she says, pass me the Pepto, would you?  Exactly.  Where's the Tums?  Or you can just hear her drinking it while he's licking her fucking...  He's down there lapping.  He's just chugging.  He's lapping. 
[03:39:30]  Smelling that peppermint smell.  Exactly.  Peppermint belches coming out of her mouth.  Oh, that feels better.  He's lapping as he sees the anal leakage.  Oh, you're laughing.  Oh, God.  Or as she blows them, little white stuff builds up around the helmet, and it's mylanta.  It's her mylanta breath.  It's her anal leakage.  Looks like those little dribs and drabs leaks on the front of a dam.  Right.  They're not pouring out.  But they're just kind of leaving streaks.  Just enough.  Right.  Just enough to show that she enjoys a good and mad sandwich. 
[03:40:00]  She's a hearty lady.  She likes to have a second helping.  She does.  She is a fan of the second helping.  Yeah.  She has to awkwardly say that there aren't people coming to dinner every night.  Oh, God.  No, it's just for us.  It's just for us.  But everyone knows why.  Yeah.  She always cooks in the bigger pot.  Did we really need to order three pies?  Right.  Right.  No, just us tonight.  Just want to make sure you get enough. 
[03:40:30]  You know, because it's charades night.  Charades.  Charades.  Family games stink.  They're terrible.  My family enjoys a good fucking game of boulder dash.  And I sit there and just fucking go through emotions.  Boulder dash.  What is that?  We did this break.  Yeah.  It's about like...  The fake words.  They're real words.  But you have to come up with a fake definition.  A fake definition.  And trick everyone to pick your definition.  Terrible.  Yeah.  I feel like family game night would just be just hostility and tension within ten minutes 
[03:41:00]  of playing.  Yeah.  You don't want to do that.  No, then you realize everyone is extremely competitive and they're just a bunch of assholes.  It's the least fun game you've ever played.  It's play win, lose, or draw.  And there's a passive aggression in the room.  Yeah.  That doesn't look like what you were drawing.  I always knew I was smarter than you.  It's like, can we just fucking hang out?  I don't play family games.  Catch up on the kids or something?  No, me neither.  Uh, let's, uh, move on here.  So, Kirliam likes the idea of modeling.  Alan, starting to show his concern here.  We'll be setting you up for a test shoot with a very well-known photographer named Celeste. 
[03:41:30]  And she's...  They're all in.  Oh, yeah.  The photographer they picked, like, shoots for Sports Illustrated.  They realize, what the fuck?  She's...  She's only got one name.  She's Celeste.  Right.  Perfect.  I don't know what her T's are good, but who knows?  Oh, she's Celeste.  Put the mic back here.  Oh, I thought pizza.  The Celeste.  Mama Celeste pizza.  I'd have gone with that for an unfunny joke.  I went for one that was unfunny and doesn't work accuracy-wise. 
[03:42:00]  I was...  That was the fucking...  The double whammy.  I proved accuracy has no bearing on the comedy of that whatsoever.  Live and learn kids.  This is Celeste.  And she's shot for Sports Illustrated, so it's a great place to start your first test.  Great place to start.  That's pretty cool.  Of course, everyone wants one life like Maud.  Oh, look.  To her.  Party and money. 
[03:42:30]  See, this is what Anne was talking about.  Partying, money.  It's just...  And no more fucking charades.  Come on.  She's not in love in that moment.  No.  Not at all.  I love how she...  The little lilt up at the end like a question.  I could be a mother?  Yeah.  Right.  It's like, aw.  It's adorable.  Yeah, here's all my money.  Crazy, right?  She's not sitting there thinking about how much sloppy joes she can buy with that money.  Yeah, but I think that she's a family values girl.  No, no.  Not at all.  She's just a young girl that's going to be corrupted by a horrid industry. 
[03:43:00]  Well, that's what she's worried about.  Extremely attractive.  That preys on young, attractive girls.  And, you know, she'll probably get into some drugs.  Fuck a football player.  To hide the hurt.  Right, right.  Right.  Nah, she doesn't care about that.  Oh, boy.  Oh, she will.  She doesn't care about it because she's never had it.  Yeah.  Yeah, she has no idea what...  She's now realizing what she's missing.  Right.  By being in L.A. of all places.  Holy fuck.  Limos and a fucking sports car.  Right.  Guys picking her up in fucking Lambos and Ferraris. 
[03:43:30]  And then this asshole...  Like M&M's.  Yeah.  And then this asshole Alan's going to go,  Don't forget, charades.  Charades.  I know you've got to network, but just be back in time for charades.  Mom got a whole bunch of man sandwiches for us.  Are you kidding me?  She has to leave man-witching charades night so she can pop in the limo and go clubbing.  Dad, she's in Paris this weekend.  Right.  I'm getting nervous about it.  Right.  Oh, you should have gotten a girl more like your mom.  But she promised she'd be back for the three-legged race. 
[03:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, we're only going to need three potato sacks this week.  Are you kidding me?  She's so God.  Only everybody like this.  Oh, when you were showing me some of these pictures, I saw of a pretty outracing, this one.  This is of other girls.  We'll know beforehand that they're wanting this kind of style, right?  Right.  I know that in today's market, you know, it's pretty normal. 
[03:44:30]  Oh, he doesn't want her showing some skin.  Just kind of go against what we believe in, you know, modest dress.  You know, nothing too short, nothing too raunchy.  We'll see.  And, you know, that's kind of the opposite of the modeling world.  I'm sure that's one guy's drooling over her.  I was thinking you don't really look for work.  That's very comforting. 
[03:45:00]  He's out of his mind.  Oh, he's going fucking nuts.  He's using his fucking mind.  And that lady was just humoring him, like, oh, fuck, we'll get this chick showing all sorts of skin.  Just give me a couple weeks.  Because he knows nothing makes him more uncomfortable than Kirliam becoming aware that she's hot.  But at the same time, he can't tell her not to do this because then she'll leave him anyway.  It's like, what, you tell me what to do?  Yeah.  I don't like that. 
[03:45:30]  Exactly.  So he's fucked on either side.  And he can't pretend to be okay with the modeling thing.  He's doing a terrible job of it.  Horrid.  Kirliam is not answering her phone.  Oh, boy.  This is when she's on the shoot.  Oh, boy.  Oh, no.  We've all been here.  Oh, yeah.  Let's be honest with each other.  We've all been here.  Where is she?  Fucking bitch.  Right.  Oh, we've all.  Especially when you feel like you're out of your league.  So then your mind just fucking.  Fucking knew it.  Fucking starts playing tricks on you. 
[03:46:00]  Oh, yeah.  Calling from Syracuse to my girlfriend's dorm in Westchester.  Oh, Christ.  The worst.  Where are you?  She wasn't picking up, and then she finally would.  And there's music, and, oh, we're just having fun.  I'll call you back later.  Hang on a second.  How did that work out for you?  It's at work.  Bad.  Bad.  Long distance relationships with girls not answering phones could be the worst thing  that could happen to a guy.  Oh, the worst.  It's horrendous.  But then, of course, me.  Anytime I was out.  Oh, hang on a second.  I've got a phone call I've got to take. 
[03:46:30]  Hey, could you please call before you just. . . .  Don't just drop by my dorm.  Could you call. . .  Oh, okay.  Okay, don't leave me.  All right, don't leave me.  You know, she was fucking other guys.  Oh, yes.  For me, it was this girl, Jen, who was at Boston College.  Oh, no.  And I was in Rochester and did the old drive to Boston, and she was like a summer love-fling 
[03:47:00]  thing that I thought was more than that.  And showed up at her dorm, because I called her.  She's like, oh, oh, you're here.  Like, it was weird.  Like, oh, you're here, not. . .  Oh, wow, you're here.  It was like, oh, you're here?  And I'm like, yeah, man, you want to, like, you know, get lunch, or I can pick you up.  Well, and I finally talked her into allowing me to go to her dorm, and then she showed up  in the lobby area of the fucking dorm area, and we had small talk, but then stupid here 
[03:47:30]  finally started to figure it all out in my head, like, oh, I think she doesn't want  me here.  I get it.  Oh, man.  Oh, oh, I see what's going on here.  I think she told her new athlete boyfriend, oh, it's Greg the weenie.  I'll go down and talk to him.  Oh, no.  And it was just polite talk.  I'm like, but the summer was amazing for us, I thought.  Oh, no.  The hopester doesn't realize the summer is over.  Summer's over.  Summer love it.  She Danny Zuko'd you. 
[03:48:00]  Exactly.  That's what I did as I walked out the fucking dorm.  Yes.  You jumped in that car going up into the sky all by yourself.  How does it go from, like, holy fuck, I think we're in love, to polite talk in a lobby area.  It's just like Labor Day, right?  It's all sunny, warm.  You're at the beach, and then the day after Labor Day, it's dismal, cold, and cloudy.  No one's on the beach.  You're like, what the fuck happened?  You should have showed up in your leather pants and started saying that you had chills  that were multiplying.  Multiplying.  I really liked her a lot at the time. 
[03:48:30]  Oh, man.  That was the last time I ever talked to her.  Was it painful?  Oh, it was brutal.  She's only left a message for you?  Huh?  Fucking new guys or no?  No, that's the Buffalo bro.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Right.  Yeah.  That was the Buffalo bro.  That's a story for another day.  Wow.  Yeah, did you get very far?  That bitch.  Wow, that's fucking not nice.  It was just like small talk.  I'm like, what are you talking about? 
[03:49:00]  Remember Montauk?  Remember going to the beaches?  Remember?  Remember?  Yeah, she remembers.  She wants to keep it a memory.  Yeah.  Nothing more.  Go away.  She got a hold of some college dick.  Yeah.  That was it.  Oh, young Greg showed up and no part of you.  But like most guys, when you're in sap mode, you're in denial the whole time.  Like, oh, she's probably busy.  She's probably like, I don't know, went for a run and wants to shower or something before  I get there. 
[03:49:30]  Yeah, yeah.  That's why, you know, she told me not to just show up.  Right.  I understand that.  Like, you're always reasoning.  She wants to look good.  You're reasoning in your head.  Somebody's not handling their new college workload well.  Right.  You know, first of all, she's busy.  Right.  She's busy.  And if I just show up, she can't do the homework.  Right, right, right.  And if I just show up and she's in a robe with her hair up and no makeup on, she'll  feel bad.  I guess I'm too much of a distraction for her.  Right.  And I remember, like, when I finally realized, which I should have realized way sooner, I 
[03:50:00]  couldn't, I wanted out of there so fucking fast.  When did you realize?  What was the moment that you learned?  When she walked down and, like, I was like, you know, you would think, okay, a couple minutes  down here, then we'll, you know, we'll go to, like, just...  Oh, go up to the room.  Yeah, but I wasn't even...  I was just...  Yeah, so maybe she could get her things and then we could leave type of shit.  Right.  I wasn't even, like, you know, fast-forwarding to hopefully, you know, jumping in bed with  or anything.  You were just a visitor in the lobby. 
[03:50:30]  Yeah, but I'm thinking, okay, she'll now say, all right, well, come on up.  I can't wait to show you my dorm room.  Yeah.  None of that.  Something, yeah.  Yeah, I can't wait to show you.  There'll probably be a photo of you in there.  Yeah, let's, let's, yeah, and then let me get my stuff and I got to, you know, you know,  whatever, and then we'll leave and there's none of that.  And then I'm just awkwardly talking, waiting for that moment.  I'm like, oh, my God, I see what's going on here.  You don't want me here at all.  And you were like, I don't have any other business being in Boston.  Oh, no.  I really like the thing.  No, a lot of, no, there was other people. 
[03:51:00]  It was Geneseo.  A whole bunch of Geneseo people moved to Boston, so we were always going there.  Did you go to lunch?  No.  Oh, no.  That was the long drive home.  It was fucking brutal.  I stayed in Boston because, like I said, because back then, you jumped in a car with a whole  bunch of dudes.  I didn't drive myself, so I had to wait it out.  I didn't want to be in Boston.  You couldn't leave.  Oh, man, you had to hang.  I couldn't wait the fuck to get the fuck out of there.  So what is she, did she hug you goodbye?  Dude, this is so many years ago, I don't remember all the details, so I don't want to make it 
[03:51:30]  up for the radio.  I love it.  I just remember, it was awkward.  I don't know if there was a hug, but I knew that, wow, I will probably never talk to her  again.  Not because I'm sitting there going, you bitch or anything.  I realized, oh, fuck, she's so moved on from me.  Oh, yeah.  How long had it been since you saw her previously?  I don't know.  Not long.  More than two weeks?  Well, I mean, summer's over, she goes to college, so, and I'm in Rochester doing my  thing, so it might have taken a few weeks to get up there. 
[03:52:00]  Had you been talking on the phone?  It could have been a month.  It could have been a month, probably.  She got her first kiss of black dick, and that was it for you.  Black dick.  Had you been talking on the phone with her and stuff?  Fuck yeah.  We were keeping in touch.  How was it on the phone?  Was she like, cool?  See, like I said, this is, you know, we're talking, this is like.  But there were probably signs.  This could be 10 years ago.  This could be like 10 years ago.  Thanks, Jimmy.  This could be 20, 20, 20, 20 something or 20 years ago. 
[03:52:30]  She was afraid you'd see all the salt blow in her room and the fucking, and size 14 basketball  shoes under the bed, long shorts.  Hey, what are these?  Let's just put it this way.  She's an old broad now.  Oh, nice.  And those perky tits are certainly nowhere near perky anymore.  Whose Billy Ocean CD is this?  She could be in her 40s now.  That's good, fucker.  She got greedy in the moment, and now she's old and fucking with some schluck. 
[03:53:00]  Who the fuck knows?  I never, that was it.  Who knows?  She could be.  You should look up on Facebook.  Yeah, we could probably try to do that.  Do you remember her name?  I mean.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I remember her name.  How could you forget?  Conti McFlatlaber.  I didn't have a car at the time, too, and I would have had, I had to, I did a couple  of times.  She was going to Dowling College down there.  Right.  She left Quinnipiac.  And I used to have to take the train from Huntington to Dowling College. 
[03:53:30]  How long was that?  It was so long because, like, it was three different rail lines on the Long Island Railroad  they got to take.  But you would do anything if you get.  I'm just sitting on that.  You got bit by the love bug.  Ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning, ning,  I was on that train for fucking hours.  Just wanted to give you a call and get on the train now, so it'll be a couple hours.  Good.  And then I fucking, like, I'm walking down that Main Street there in Oakdale for Dowling, 
[03:54:00]  and it's like, oh, well, Flores, I'll get a rose.  Oh, no.  Oh, yes, I did.  To be honest, I think I do.  did something similar to that get a rose she'll like me more to be so excited she's gonna bring  our relationship back together again in fairness to these girls there's nothing worse than your  new friends at college and you're meeting these new guys and fucking schlobo old fucking place

[03:55:00]  you just stuck around just stuck around i was a stick around guy thinking that i could keep the  dream going here's a college down the fucking drain the worst thing you could do is walk around a  college campus when you don't go there anymore they what would you everyone looks at you i'm like dude  i'm i'm only a year older than you fucks relax what would you do yeah what did you get an apartment and  then just walk around campus i started my radio career close by so i had an excuse but it was nice  that i was just on the outskirts of the college and so every now and then you'd come in every now

[03:58:30]  ends right in her box oh good starts at her ankles goes to daddy's bank account exactly right to her  veg and then right to the next girl to everything this treasure map was like probably the most amazing  thing in his three and a half year old brain to me it was a lot of scribbles and stuff to be honest  yeah yeah i go oh a treasure map for you and blah blah and he goes yeah i go so how was he goes  well oh no we we didn't get to play why and in my head i'm like oh my god please don't tell me 
[03:59:00]  she blew him off in his treasure map that means everything to his little brain he was gonna like  what they were going he made this treasure map for him and her right to go follow it and get in the  classroom whatever some dumb thing and she for whatever reason didn't play with him oh that and  i but i could see in his eyes and he's only three and a half like the yeah yeah like it's a bit was a  bit devastating to him then you give him that good advice he when the girls do that you have to kill 
[03:59:30]  them exactly make sure she's not treasure mapping with a you know what that's all you need i wanted  to pull her aside and go tell me a fucking favor yeah come on play treasure fucking map with my kid  but then you get older and you realize brutal how much time you spent being a sap was wasted that if  you just hadn't been a sap just don't be saying how many girls you could have gotten just by not  being a sap crazy i wasted a bunch of years being a sap me too real man for reals  i love you for fucking my whole time in buffalo sweet my whole my whole time in buffalo i can 
[04:00:00]  officially say i was a sap yeah nothing better than telling a girl you love her and then she goes  oh that's sweet oh no exactly oh no haha ew junior high and high school stunk on ice  oh what a pain in the ass all that shit was one of the buffalo stories um there was always the old  boyfriend that was around that she swears she wasn't still with and that fast forwarded to her 
[04:00:30]  when she got mad at me decided to leave messages of her having sex with her right on my uh voicemail  love that one um which i proceeded to play for her mom and her grandfather because good those two  people thought she was like a fucking angel so i'm like well here's your angel daughter that's the  short version of that story but there was another guy that was around and he ended up being on one of  these home improvement shows and when we were doing our i think it was the virus tour uh-huh  do you remember when the i forgot what show it was but it pulled up to the same hotel as us that 
[04:01:00]  with a giant fucking display on the side it's one of these home improvement where they go into a  shithole and make it cool and i'm like holy fuck and it was the guy that i i knew from buffalo that  was friends with my quote because at this point i don't believe she ever thought i was her boyfriend  quote girlfriend and i remember one time going over to her house unexpectedly i'm like oh where  is she oh maybe she's in the basement so i go down the basement and she's on like the fucking  washing washing machine and he's extremely close oh no not naked but extremely close and also i'm like 
[04:01:30]  oh hi greg oh he's helping me move and like a fucking sap like oh okay well anyway i'm here  what do you want to do now it was so obvious so obvious when you use your older eyes to look  back at some of this shit you're like oh my god what a fucking sap was but then uh we i actually  ran into him when i think it was worcester didn't we play outside worcester or something tracy morgan 
[04:02:00]  yes okay and he was there i'm like i forgot his name even though we could look him up tim allen  and also my it was good to see the guy and i i had to ask him like come on dude tell me and he's  like he admitted that he was with her the whole time like i figured whatever because now this is  years i got i need to know how bad she looked nowadays he goes oh man she's a big fat pig my  wife and then we start and then we start fucking laughing and kind of high-fiving which was weird  because at the time he was my fucking competition i guess jesus christ but you know that whole look 
[04:02:30]  thing there was a girl and uh i guess her family was hosting this kid from fucking england right  and uh oh jesus seriously i know how old she 16 17 yeah she was she was like 16 um i was going out  with her at the time and uh this kid from england comes up comes up and and they're they're just all  hanging out like smoking weed and ciggies and stuff and and everything and then i'd come over 
[04:03:00]  and we'd be hanging out and and you'd look over real quick and just see them like looking at each  other right like making eyes and stuff and then they'd look away real quick it's like maybe they're  just you know pals maybe you know there's probably an inside joke they told yeah yeah yeah you're just  trying not to remember you don't want to believe believe it yeah yeah that he's laying some  uncircumcised english cock to her fucking prick i think when i turned i i'll be honest i think when 
[04:03:30]  i turned 30 was when i was like uh i wasn't a set was enough i think i was a sap well into my  late 20s though yeah definitely but then i absolutely knew i wasn't a sap anymore i was just like  just fucking keep your eyes open you idiot jesus yeah i uh i think i made it to 30 being a fucking  sap 28 29 definitely i would build up like like relationships in my head oh yeah that weren't 
[04:04:00]  even fucking there like there was a cute girl at school and i have this whole thing and i'd literally  start falling in love with a girl i never talked to right i never even fucking talked to her  i used to write in my head in high school oh no i used to write love notes to girls that i  didn't talk to in my head but never actually write them or give them to her why would you like i just  sit there up staying up at night like you get and then i'm going to tell them that you get all that  bad that emotion that heartbreak out of nothing nothing didn't even know you nothing was there i had 
[04:04:30]  an amazing relationship with this girl in high school this is a true story too you want to know  what the relationship was i would follow her home every day there you go from a distance yeah it was  the most amazing relationship to me that was everything like it it felt like it was a relationship  because i was following her home jody foster i know i know and then i'd see her in the hallway  and that the heart would just go oh and i thought she knew like that you know i thought she was 
[04:05:00]  feeling anything of course i don't give a shit i thought she was feeling exactly the same shit i was  but you know she was too scared to tell me as well so that's why just following her home was the  greatest thing ever and i felt like maybe she knew i was following her home and that was cool for her  because she was too scared too but a she had no fucking idea who i was b she never knew i was  fucking following her home you mean you didn't uh you didn't uh play ozzy when you walked by her house  and write a note that said if you want to know who i am wear this and then they wore the scarf the 
[04:05:30]  next day but you didn't tell him who you are then why'd you tell him to wear it because i was mentally  ill she did the same thing with him with a noose wear this  you walked by her house playing ozzy yeah my friend frank and i went and slipped a note in her mailbox  and i was uh wish it was a suicide note i uh terrible i fucking uh yeah i'm very embarrassed 
[04:06:00]  by this part because i kind of wanted her to know who i because everybody knew that i loved ozzy  and so i wrote something in spanish at the bottom of the letter but it was the name of an ozzy album  in spanish oh why why in spanish i don't know oh oh is that stupid yeah yeah yeah it was very stupid  there was a girl that was uh she looked like uh 16 or it was might have been younger 15 year old uh 
[04:06:30]  ann romano and i was in love with her oh she had a little perky red hair and and stuff and i just was  like head over heels this is in uh in uh like junior high in california when i was out there  and i remember built again building up a relationship out of nothing there was nothing there i was in  class with her girlfriend that's hilarious that never happened and i remember that song if you leave me  now take away the biggest part and when that would play i would think of her and think of how 
[04:07:00]  heartbreaking it would be if she left me but we were never together what an asshole did you what  an asshole were you ever convinced that a an older woman was attracted to you when you were hated oh  yes no no i'm talking when i was uh i would say 12 ish now so i didn't even have a real dick yet  uh my my uncle my uncle who's about 10 or 11 years older than me i think that's about right 
[04:07:30]  so he came around he was in his early 20s and he brought the the fucking bikini broads around because  it was my grandma's beach house and one of the one of the broads that came around just paid attention  to me oh politely now that i look at my older eyes back at the situation yes i was convinced she was  fucking in love with me did you get a little boner oh that shit a little boner but i'm 12  what would she fucking want for me but in my dumb still developing brain i was convinced because she 
[04:08:00]  gave me just tiny bit of attention i started fast forward that we we would be boyfriend and  girlfriend she was 23 years old with a 12 year old boy that still didn't have a real dick yet  not a hint of a muscle even nothing fantastic do you know i used to have the same thing on my  paper out there was a woman who was older and i got real vibes from her i thought i would crank my  dick to her i would replay how old were you 12 13 i want to say 13 12 in that area but every 
[04:08:30]  interaction we had her robe would always be a little bit open i fucking every day would replay  that moment and just crank it but here's the question now that you're older looking back do you  think there was actually something going on with her like she kind of she kind of liked to be a  little bit of a tease or or she just didn't think twice that her robe might have been open a little  i think she thought it was a fun flirty thing to do with the nothing sexually yeah like the boys in  the neighborhood yeah just kind of cute to flirt with the 12 or 13 year old nothing like she wanted 
[04:09:00]  to fuck me wow oh i was convinced this uh my uncle's friend oh my god how embarrassing it's always  just like what was it the worst what was i gonna do if it nothing i had a 10 speed bike  get on my bike right we'll go ride somewhere when i was 16 a girl i had a crush on wrote hi sam in my  notebook oh shit and i spent the next six months trying to figure out how i was going to take that  note to i'm asking you out on a date never said a word to her why because you have the beginning 
[04:09:30]  of the plot was if you think i'm fucking you you you're you you must be  did i ever tell the caddy story embarrassing so embarrassing the caddy story there was uh  i was a caddy for many years for people that don't know and every once in a while you'd have to caddy  for their their kids which was so annoying they were the same age as you and they would be the 
[04:10:00]  biggest fucking pricks yeah because their parents had money but i caddy for this this one couple's  daughter who was my age and i was out of my mind like oh this girl is the hottest girl ever i could  have been more than 14 maybe and then i had to clean her you know her bag at the end of the round  and i was i was convinced i was convinced because the one stupid round of golf where i had a caddy for 
[04:10:30]  that uh you know she liked me as much as i was attracted to her yeah of course that's nonsense  and i never talked to her again but uh as i was cleaning her bag i'm like i wonder what's in here  and i uh i think i told a story before and i found a tampon oh it drove me insane just because  you know and i took i took a trophy i took it with me wow he stole a serial killer he said he used to  stalk girls and steal their tampons that's a good one 14 i don't care all that shit is the just 
[04:11:00]  fucking like oh what a creep i don't remember i brought it i brought it home and i felt like i had  some weird connection with her did you make a hair doll of course you did yeah did you put your foot  up on the toilet like the instructions and shove it up your asshole i would have deserved that at that  point what a loser yanking material as a kid but i saw the instructions on the back of the tampon box 
[04:11:30]  but there was something about like this is hers and i don't know it goes in her pussy  yeah which yeah which i couldn't even even even at like 14 i was still oh mine was blown by a you  know yes it's proof of her vagina i guess it exists i don't even need a stupid psychologist calling it i  don't need to know what that means i just know i was fucking out of my mind with hormones we live  next door to two really sexy teenage girls i was probably 12 and they would dry their underwear on 
[04:12:00]  the line it's the only time i ever i'm not really into i stole a pair of satin panties oh and i  fucking cranked and they had been dried and washed oh my god i cranked i would wrap those around my  dick and jerk off for a fucking couple of years that got me around you'd wrap them around your dick  that soft satiny panty i cranked that on my prick for years oh my god maybe two years i kept it in a  box like i didn't know what to do with this you never cleaned it no i didn't come on it i went there 
[04:12:30]  with no loads on it oh no loads that's disgusting you're still getting fucking pre here comes the  pre so anyway just smelled like sweaty dick all the time yeah no it's just i would just rub it like  and smell put on my face and dream of their asses i liked uh the panty drawer every so often i remember  being on a few jobs and poking and looking in a few panty drawers just looking you ever see that one  that looks like a fucking the bottom of a band-aid when it's pulled off the one that goes right 
[04:13:00]  of rag panties the rag panties are great i love the rag panties good old rag panties and then the  dirty ones too and the hamper oh that's kind of you're looking there and just see some fucking uh  yeah you ever smell like a little little ass part of it oh yeah nice fucking looking at with that  stupid like why is that white fucking material in there to show a world of hurt that's probably so  you know she knows what a fucking disaster she has why don't we get back to alan and kearley 
[04:13:30]  i guess the point is uh the reason i like this show is because i just understand yeah being a sap  i think most guys have i think now we all know you think women are saps too when they're figuring it  all out when they're younger they have a little more power over i think women tend to be more saps  later yeah maybe because they're convinced they're going to get married they're going to have kids  there you go and once once guys figure it out then the women become saps right once that we give up 
[04:14:00]  yeah yes keith milwaukee has to pay closer attention he writes which one of you wrote a note with a  check if you love me box oh wasn't that you i think that was jimmy it was check or no it was check  here if it was something else it wasn't if you love me it was something about it like notice me or like  me oh yeah do you want to do you like me to check yeah yeah i did that yeah you'd always give girls  an option yeah you know you would give them an out me or throw throw yourself into the sticker 
[04:14:30]  butch yeah that was julie her name was i i think i remember one girl sandy i used to talk to on the  phone and uh this this is why i'm a stand-up because i would fucking just read out of blanche  knots remember blanche knot would have those polish jokes black jokes uh she was a very very famous  truly tasteless jokes oh yeah and uh there was a bunch of them there was like you know there was  some of them were gripped they would be broken up into sections or they'd be all polish jokes  and i would just sit on the phone for hours and just read her jokes and she would either laugh or not  laugh i remember how personally i took it when she wouldn't laugh oh i love making her laugh 
[04:15:00]  oh but over the phone yeah that's yeah to be phoning it in yes phoning in his material  always better at phoners then than i am now well kirliam and alan from uh 90 day fiancee  so now oh oh it started with the uh kirliam is not answering her phone that was about an hour ago  right so she's at her so that reminded me of some yeah all right i got it so now she's getting her  shots done yeah she said she's getting her photos taken but alan's calling her this guy's so insecure 
[04:15:30]  that he doesn't understand that she's not answering her phone because she's in the middle of fucking  getting getting her modeling shots done yes  i tried to call kirliam at the photo shoot and she didn't pick up you know i was a little worried  oh dang i hope everything is going well being a supermodel i guess voicemail is leaving  love you oh bye a million things running through my head and one of them were positive 
[04:16:00]  like you think it's falling off your head your hair  poor fuck  don't mind me don't mind me it's him walking into the shoot  because she wasn't answering her phone he walked into the shoot  yeah he showed up while she's taking oh my god this is not going to play out well  that's not nice supportive  when women smell that shit yeah they're done possessiveness they're done when they smell that 
[04:16:30]  insecurity crap i'm absolutely blown away by how stunning kirliam is but seeing a room full of  people staring at her most of them men ah it's a little hard to stomach oh  oh boy you dumb mormon fuck yeah really you are so sunk this guy we're running on a show but this guy  uh go ahead tim and jersey we should have went to the phones everyone had a fucking story 
[04:17:00]  everyone had a story  uh you want this is fucking embarrassing but uh i figured if i'm going to tell somebody i'll tell you  guys um so this is girl i have four sisters two older two younger uh and this one girl yvonne used  to come over and hang out with one of my older sisters all the time she leave her purse in the  bathroom right so uh one day i'm going through her purse in the bathroom looking for anything  to get uh you know my raging heart on so i can whack off thinking about her in the next room 
[04:17:30]  and i find a tampon right and it's like it's the top's open like the plastic's open but it's in  it was one of the newer ones like in the plastic sleeve you know yeah um so i uh i took it out  and i pushed it out a little bit and i jerked off on it and i put it back in the sleeve and i put it  back in the place oh man that's very anti-social that is anti-social but so when she used to call  the house like i get her on the phone and get her to talk to me like ask her for some advice 
[04:18:00]  and i go in the bathroom and and jerk off but you gotta do it really quietly because you don't want  her to know like you hear she hears you're breathing heavy she's gonna know something's up  so you gotta be real quiet when you when you smack everyone at her on the phone i'm like  can you tell me why i don't get big grades in school oh so he's just hearing her voice and and  you'd be jacking that is some really i just listen to her talk and i say what was anti-social  behavior yeah absolutely you know i was like fucking psychotic so now i just kill puppies 
[04:18:30]  yeah no she uh she actually ended up being like they all turn out to be fucking fat and disgusting  and uh i married some next welder you know that uh you know well you you also said you were hoping  she would get pregnant so you guys would fall in love oh yeah absolutely i wanted her to get  pregnant so she with the tampon thing she followed me because i was 11.  oh you were 11.  jeez.  i was gonna have i was gonna be married and have kids by the time i was 12. 
[04:19:00]  exactly you're such a fucking man.  she's not shoving a tampon in her when she's ovulating sir but it's 11 of course you don't  know all that shit yeah i knew that though you did sure yeah i know i couldn't arch scenes  on a tamp and shove it a cut and get her pregnant oh no i know that but i mean yeah fair enough  you know those 976 numbers yes i when they first came out i first got wind of that from my older  brother because he's called and put me on the phone once i thought it was funny one month i would you 
[04:19:30]  know it's like 60 seconds or 45 seconds for like three dollars yeah i call it i go jerk off come  back out call it again go jerk off come back call it again my father gets the phone bill now he's a  cop right for like 30 years right a tough guy right he gets the phone bill it's like 1300  you know back in like 1982 that's a lot of fucking money man he's like what the fuck is this and i 
[04:20:00]  blamed it on my brother he got his ass beat you're psychotic man i was such a fucking asshole man but  hey listen as many times as i spurged on fucking anything i could find it always was her face  wow you know i uh i joined one of those 900 numbers when they first came out i had to send  a money order to california i had to go like a 90 for a month you get a month and then you get a code 
[04:20:30]  with it so for a month you could call up unlimited and jerk off as live girls how was it it was live  girls or was it just a recording it was live girls all right and uh i got it just had your say  and i called exactly he's interviewing me for his podcast right thanks i got a uh i got a uh i called  the minute i got it i called up to talk and i guess it was like fucking nine in the morning or  whatever here and then it was so early there yeah so i called it and the woman answered and she's  like hello i'm like hi she's like yeah i'm like well you know i got the number and she's like you want 
[04:21:00]  to talk about that now yes you fuck yeah and she did and i fucking jerked off oh yeah yeah i remember  those lines yeah was she into it no not at all she would have been more turned on telling me how to  put a transmission in back to curiam uh she likes modeling alan is more concerned here he's panicking  oh yeah what did you think it was good okay could you could you do that every day yeah yeah i like it 
[04:21:30]  i tried to call you oh i'm so sorry were you were you in the middle of shooting or makeup or something  like that oh you're doing makeup makeup yeah what yeah you look too pretty when you model too pretty  thank you you look too pretty thank you i don't like it i don't like it promise you won't get sucked  up oh why are you asking me don't leave me oh oh let's just go ah okay and that's a visual we're 
[04:22:00]  not watching it today we just got the audio clips but whoa her eyes are like that was her that was  her brain going enough what totally the best way to guarantee that somebody's gonna leave you say  don't leave me please don't leave me oh that's the worst nah she's not going she's a good girl  some guy here i think it was on pal talk said that uh in uh in high school he was literally begging a  girl not to break up with him and he thinks of it now and just cringes yeah like like you still get 
[04:22:30]  that visceral of course like horrible feeling because he was probably in the middle of there going  don't leave me oh crying oh that's embarrassing did you ever cry around a girl in high school  oh yeah i've done that in adulthood that's terrible you used to cry a lot oh no yeah that i could 
[04:23:00]  absolutely say i didn't do oh i'm thinking it would be a sympathy angle or something i do that watching  if i'm watching tv or a movie now it's hard not to drop a few oh jesus you fruit all right well  there's a line somewhere between i cry too much and you on the other hand i would  probably have opposite extremes old death valley eyes exactly i wouldn't i wouldn't cry in front of  them but as soon as i was you know they were gone i would put on rem everybody hurts sometimes 
[04:23:30]  yes sometimes everybody everybody  bitches you fucking bitches don't even know what the fuck it was like they destroy us i'm high school  bullshit not me they didn't i just fucked them and forgot them yeah fuck anyone stuck it right in  there it's the four f's yeah find them feel them fuck them and forget them yeah then finger them  oh find them finger them wait find them finger them fuck them fought on them forget them 
[04:24:00]  you ever have the girl that comes back what and then you're just so not into it anymore  no but you'll never happen really no i would have been right back into her again once a girl is gone  they're like fucking convicts and gotten out they never show back they never come back i had a girl  come back and then she's like isn't this great we're back together and stuff i'm like  i just didn't feel the same i was like yeah it was over that was that was the one where i found  the giant sneakers in the trunk i told that story too right that's not good i i decided to stay back 
[04:24:30]  and and start my radio career while everyone decides to move to boston have an amazing fucking  you know social life and we would go there a lot and we looked like the idiots coming from  cold rochester where nothing's happening for a 23 24 year old and they're in boston like i don't know  they had millions of opportunities just have a good fucking time parties and uh my my my girlfriend  we were together a good year oh year and a half at this point she's a full relationship back then 
[04:25:00]  she decided she wanted to go with the boston gang and i was like fuck man but you're too young to  make it official and stuff you're like shit we're just out of college and you're gonna do this but you  can't tell her not to so uh but she moved to actually uh cape cod and then it and just like  the other one it was tough to get her like to commit to like me going there and it finally  happened she's like all right all right i'm like i'm in boston like i went to boston for new year's 
[04:25:30]  i'm like hey but i didn't want to be in boston for new year's i wanted to be with her but i used  the excuse i'm in boston new year's but uh you know i actually went to boston with the hope that i  would run into her and so i drive all the way to cape cod from boston you know what that ride is  and she picks me up no i didn't drive because she picked me up so how the fuck did i get there  train probably i don't know if there's a train that goes is there a helicopter walking is there a yak  ride might have been rickshaw honestly it might have been a bus or something oh god no because she 
[04:26:00]  absolutely didn't i didn't i did not try and she picks me up wherever the fuck i went to maybe a train  i don't remember fuck and uh i she opens a trunk for me to put my bag in for this i'm gonna you know  be out there for a night giant i mean giant basketball sneakers in her truck oh and i'm just  like oh and at that moment everything made sense i'm like oh you didn't ask her that giant footwear is 
[04:26:30]  that i do believe at the time i did and she was like you know whatever oh and we we had a we had a  good time and then i was just like oh that's over obviously because as soon as i leave giant  basketball sneaker guys coming around again yep i'm like i ain't sharing a dude with my chick  oh that's all right i said that wrong oh i ain't sharing a chick with that oh that's great yeah i 
[04:27:00]  ain't sharing a fucking chick with a fucking no whatever i get it i get it exactly well we  understand and uh but but then i move on to buffalo and she she came to see me because now  she's back in rochester the kid cod boston thing didn't work out and she came and saw me and she  was excited she was she was done with that guy whatever and she hung out we had a good time but  there was just something that wasn't right there was a vagina that was that was a giant stretched 
[04:27:30]  out bad maybe it was her fucking pistons tattoo and the giant pussy weird way i felt bit i'm like  i wanted to say you ruined this because i felt bad because i'm like she was excited like all right  i had to figure some shit out and no i really want to be with you and you know and i'm like  man that's fucking i'm done i just knew i didn't hate her or anything but i was like yeah this isn't  the fucking thing there was just a uh the thought of a girl with another guy that was the worst 
[04:28:00]  i don't even think ever i don't even think through memories i can conjure up the type of anger and and  and helplessness and and despair that that feeling was right back then like you can't even conjure it  up anymore no but it was horrible yes it was because you were you know in love you're like but that  should be me and then you're picturing like her with another guy it was the worst thing ever 
[04:28:30]  yeah my when i was in syracuse my girlfriend ended up hooking up back in westchester with  another guy whose name was sam oh no boy and it drove me to the brink of insanity for months  of course yeah yeah then you finally get over it then you get over it you're better realize you  wasted a shitload of days being sad about like and too much time in the relationship the second  you fucking have a conversation with another girl and maybe touch her shoulder it's over right  and it's like fuck that other guy i don't even know her name but unfortunately that took some 
[04:29:00]  time back then yes it did uh so uh alan is wondering if kirliam really likes to model  natasha call me today what'd she say she say i am i am good oh okay so she liked your photos yeah  and she's like she's already sending them out when i heard the agents want to book me i was like  wow that's a big deal and maybe this could be a career that's career how do you how do you feel  about that yeah yeah i like it sure sure what oh boy yeah because um it's possible that might

[04:44:30]  as i leave giant basketball sneaker guys coming around again yeah i'm like i ain't sharing a dude  with my chick you gave opie line of the day on that it was funny yeah i guess it was you never

[04:45:30]  her home from school sometimes would answer the phone and i would think oh well you're just giving  them a ride home well i didn't really have that cool thing going on i was in ninth grade my brother  was a senior in high school so that summer we were hanging out i was hanging out with him we were smoking  weed we were being cool i thought i was cool well there was no girls around and they were like man  there's no girls i said dude i can know a couple girls let me give them a call so i called her up she 
[04:46:00]  says cool party yeah beers weed story's too long story's too long it didn't hold my attention buddy  next time next time and apparently from our call screen saying that's not really what he was saying  yeah i don't know i don't know it was way too long though i can't i can't handle it but it was  refreshing i mean for me i don't feel like i came into my own and was confident enough to feel  comfortable in what i was in the way i spoke to women until after i already met the chick i ended up  marrying it was a total waste total waste of time you just think back and you're like if i could go 
[04:46:30]  back to like my late teens early 20s with the knowledge and confidence that i have today  i could clean up dennis falcone just walked in same way you're exactly right i mean i was like the class  clown i could get up on stage yeah and dance and do the twist but i couldn't look a girl straight in  the eye you wouldn't want to go out to a movie okay yeah no she just thinks i'm a goofball she just  doesn't take me seriously i don't think so but you go back to your high school reunion women are 
[04:47:00]  going to be lining up to talk to you you think so without a doubt well yeah look at the fucking  ring on my finger now i blew it dennis house you can you could slide that thing right off is that  what you do slide that thing right off not bad not bad dennis how'd you think the super show went  on friday for you you were here you were djing the whole show uh you got to have a first look  at all the at the at bobo and his naked twister and and the lap dances that stalker patty and mike  bachetti got it was it was it was a mini series all in one it was wasn't it just so much going on

[04:49:30]  jimmy in utah hey what's up sam here is my here's my take on 90 day shlobo and that is that he's going  to fuck this girl he's going to put a baby up in her yeah and then when she leaves him for the the  big black uh basketball star yes he sues her for her future earnings sound familiar so you saying  you do it in reverse because now the girl is ending up with this basketball player so she's going to be  receiving money and you're entitled to some of that because you brought her to america and he's not 
[04:50:00]  that smart but is that not a good idea jimmy if everybody were as smart as you and i there'd be a lot  less uh there'd be a lot less heartbroken men out there wouldn't there be there you go sammy what time  is it uh it's 49 after the hour we don't do that on the post show that's a pre-show exclusive  and you know what else is dumb about that if he knocks her up yeah she has a kid and then she  leaves him for a basketball player most courts usually will still favor the female so he'll  wind up having to pay for the kid while she's being taken care of with the basketball player 
[04:50:30]  he'll pay child support for his kid while whoever the the 2014 version of dennis rodman is just  just ruining that young innocent brazilian that he brought over here eric did you have a clip of  the day today uh i did let me hear it uh here it is well i've put in mind some jolly ranchers  exactly twizzlers what is that a fucking and obviously tampon yeah that is really blood red 
[04:51:00]  obviously his booster is jelly donuts look how red yours is it really is red what is that  this go overboard with the greens today no this is this is the first time i'm trying this is beets  yeah what else i hate eating beets but i'll i'll put beets in a juice any day a good beet salad home  right i hate eating beets i love it i'll drink there's kale in it too but it's mostly it's beet a  little bit of fruit what kind of fruit i don't remember i gotta look in the we made it last night 
[04:51:30]  but it's in the book is there a booster in yours no no you gotta go with the boost you have a boost  how do you make this shit what it's just like a fucking regular blender dude no no magic bullet  the blender is pretty much this piece with the blade so you could clean it much easier instead of  digging all the way in to try to clean blades it's a blender upside down it's amazing what'd you  just take that clip because it was about you and how great the magic bullet is you just want to  just get some plugging in well no not necessarily it was also that i love how you know jim has lost 
[04:52:00]  so much weight and he comes off like he's jack la lane but then anytime something else comes up he  doesn't know what any kind of health or diet stuff is that's a great point because like i picked up  my because we were all talking about we're all a bunch of women on this show like it used to be  just a locker room full of guys talking about chicks now it's a bunch of men in a spa talking  about their smoothies but i was like i've got uh kale banana strawberry and orange nice and jim 
[04:52:30]  goes all right yeah that's all sugar you can't be drinking that that's all sugar but he also goes  to the gym too he also works out he does you have to you have to do both do you go to a gym eric  uh no i do it at home that you would you would you have predicted that was the answer uh if he has a  good gym at home well i think you need the motivation would you have predicted that eric does  or doesn't you would have predicted yeah you saw that coming i love the guy but i know  he's not going to a gym either i'd be just use it as a hanger for my clothes things at home  yeah you just uh uh put all your clothes over the treadmill or whatever it's a drying rack yeah 
[04:53:00]  it's a drying rack um well eric how was your beet juice did you finish it i gotta eat it once the  show's done that's meal two oh sounds gross yeah it's uh beets it's blueberries um i think there's  some uh kale in it uh there's a little bit of honey flax seeds in there you gotta put the flax seeds  to help the digestion is that right to help your shit that's right uh friday a week from friday is going  to be the big conclusion of the eric rolling bet that's why eric's been uh drinking all these 
[04:53:30]  juices and stuff are you feeling confident uh i'm feeling hungry put some twizzlers in there i like  twizzlers well i said that earlier you're too hungry and confident you're too you're too hungry  and cranky to feel confident yeah i just want it over with how did it how does the beet juice thing  taste um i had a little bit of it i tried it after we we did that segment yeah it it smells like  lawn clippings like if you ever mowed a lawn and then took the bag off the lawnmower and smelt the 
[04:54:00]  bag that's what it that's what it is i know you're supposed to do mainly vegetables but you could put  some fruit in there and make something tasty some of them you have to because you can't just do beets  and kale straight up how could you you need to throw in some like pineapple or lemon well that's  what jimmy was saying because that's all sugar this thing that comes with this blender it says  yeah but then 50 leafy greens 50 fruit jim will drink a bottle of diet coke or diet dr pepper and  that's that's the same thing it's way worse it's way worse you could have all the fruit you want 
[04:54:30]  and if you're not if you it's better than drinking diet dr pepper well on the shred diet he says you  could have like one diet diet so yeah but i i've skipped that i don't even do it that's good i've  been a month and a half without soda and doing really well with it i gotta tell you roland has told  me off the air he's feeling really confident he's doing i don't know what diet he's doing i can tell  you how he feels confident why because he's wearing pants again he was he hadn't worn jeans  and regular pants in so long it was just shorts and track suits i mean i went i was hanging out  with him over the weekend and we were at a bar that had delicious pretzels rolling stayed away 
[04:55:00]  from the pretzels good for him there's an ice cream spot right around he lives in brooklyn now and  there's like a hipster ice cream spot that makes delicious ice creams right around the corner from  his apartment he stays away from it me and my wife got ice cream he didn't get any my wife and i  you're right dennis i gotta be a little better about that don't i that's good he's got good he's  got great willpower though he's doing a good job with it let me tell you something dennis you gotta  get an exciting treat for the woman in your life don't you yes we do you do specifically you do and
