<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a largely incoherent segment.  Much of the audio was unintelligible, filled with repeated instances of "To be continued...".  Despite this, fragments of conversation emerged, including references to "It's our car,"  "It's a fake show,"  "Tuna," and  "The fuck...". The latter phrases seem unconnected, suggesting a rambling, possibly nonsensical, exchange between Opie and Anthony. The segment concluded with the repeated phrase "They're...", hinting at a discussion about a group of people, but lacking any further context to identify the subject or participants. No guests were present or identifiable during this portion.
