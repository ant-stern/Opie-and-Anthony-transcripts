<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with Sam Roberts hosting a "Worst of the Week Countdown," which prominently featured Pat Cooper's retirement announcement from stand-up comedy.  Cooper detailed his reasons, including hearing loss, tinnitus, memory issues, and difficulty reading his notes.  The conversation covered his career, finances, and potential future podcast ventures, characterized by Cooper's self-deprecating and vulgar humor.  Earlier in the week, the show had guests such as Mike Buschetti, Piers Morgan, William Shatner, and Avril Lavigne.

The "Worst of the Week" continued with a scathing critique of Terry Clifford from the Rochester radio show, "The Bee Morning Coffee Club," filled with offensive language targeting Clifford's appearance.  Audio clips highlighted perceived awkwardness in the show.  The hosts speculated about the authenticity of the show's Facebook page.  This segment included surprise appearances by Avril Lavigne (briefly with husband Chad Kroeger) and William Shatner. Lavigne's appearance involved playful interaction from outside the studio before a short interview promoting her single. Shatner had a lengthy conversation about his new album, flying experiences, and anecdotes from his *Star Trek* career.

The show featured an interview with musician Bill Sherwood, discussing his album *Ponder the Mystery*, his acting roles (including *Columbo*), and humorous anecdotes, including one about a man repeatedly saying "Yo-Yo Ma" after a head injury.  William Shatner's presence outside the studio became a running gag, with failed attempts to get his autograph.  Mike Bacchetti recounted humorous experiences from his brief time in the Marines.  A heated debate between Anthony Cumia and Piers Morgan on gun control ensued, with Morgan advocating for stricter controls and Cumia arguing for self-defense rights.  The discussion covered the Second Amendment, background checks, and the NRA.  This segment was interspersed with commercial breaks.

The gun control discussion with Piers Morgan continued, clarifying his stance on restricting military-style weapons.  The hosts challenged his views, comparing gun control to Prohibition.  The Second Amendment and the role of militias were debated.  The segment concluded with Morgan promoting his book.  The "Worst of the Week" returned, covering Opie accidentally revealing E-Rock's phone number, resulting in a humorous, albeit contentious, payment of E-Rock's weight in quarters as compensation.

The show ended with advertisements and a "Friends of the Show" segment featuring Robert Kelly, Jermaine Fowler, Louis Gomez, Monster Voice, Joe List, and Chris (a.k.a. Fat Ass).  This segment involved a raucous, often offensive conversation with numerous personal attacks, racist and homophobic remarks, lacking a central theme beyond comedic insults.

A later segment discussed a caller's father's death (stabbing) compared to another's (alcoholism), quickly devolving into vulgar and nonsensical conversations involving Kelly Fasuka, Louis Gomez, and Jermaine.  The conversation included racist remarks (using the N-word repeatedly), graphic descriptions of bodily functions, particularly focusing on Louis Gomez's anal problems and a possible skin infection.  Tangents included a talking monkey, MMA fighter apparel, and *Fright Night* actors.  A recurring joke about one of the hosts performing oral sex was present, interspersed with commercial breaks.  The show briefly mentioned Sir Paul McCartney's upcoming appearance on another SiriusXM show.

[00:02:00]  Face.  Welcome, welcome, welcome to the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I'm Sam Roberts from ONA.  You know me by now.  I also host after Opie and Anthony Live.  And this is the Worst of the Week Countdown, where we highlight everything good that happened  this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  What a show to get to today.  Because it was a great week of shows.  Jocktober is, of course, going on this month.  Mike Buschetti, very strange comedian, in studio.  E-Rock and the cell phone slash Opie owes him money saga gets paid off. 
[00:02:30]  Piers Morgan was in studio.  William Shatner in studio.  Avril Lavigne stopped by, surprisingly.  But first, Pat Cooper had an announcement to make.  We've all grown to know and love Pat Cooper over the last few years, specifically on the  Opie and Anthony show.  So when Pat Cooper and his people reached out to us and said that he had an announcement  that he wanted to make on the Opie and Anthony show, we did nothing but oblige.  Pat Cooper takes control of the room and makes his big announcement to start the Worst of the 
[00:03:00]  Week Countdown.  I hear you have a big announcement.  This is my last show.  What?  What are you talking about?  Come on.  I did.  I quit.  What do you mean?  No, I retired.  Honestly.  I retired because my body said it.  Why?  Really?  See?  Is that why he lost his hair in the back?  I got nothing to play with.  I'm just going to fucking die if I just let my body tell me. 
[00:03:30]  You've been saying that for years.  What do you mean you retired?  16 years, I can't hear.  22 years, I got tinnitus.  I'm on the stage and I'm fighting it.  But you know something?  It's okay.  Now the body's saying you can't fight it no more.  Now what you want to think used to take a second.  Now I'm down to 12 seconds if I want to think.  So now I got a problem.  Then I say, guys, I'm writing notes so in case you forget.  I pick up the notes.  I can't read my handwriting.  Jesus.  Now I'm standing like a schmuck. 
[00:04:00]  So I go in the audience to ask him what the fuck I wrote.  That's what I knew.  That's kind of funny.  That's funny, though.  That is funny.  That's funny, though.  That's funny, yes.  That's when you know it's fucking over.  Jesus.  Now, I was told by my brain surgeon, I swear, Steve's here, and he says, you have great  attitude.  But you're fucking old.  Oh, boy.  So I said, fine.  And he shows me a print of my brain.  He says, you have a good brain, but the two dots in the corner, he says, that means you 
[00:04:30]  are old.  So do what you do.  I said, what should I do?  Quit.  Jesus.  So I quit.  Now I'm happy here.  No, you can't quit.  Not like you're a boxer with a detached retina.  You can't quit.  Right.  You can just keep doing it.  I ain't doing shit.  I ain't even gonna do this show no more.  I don't give a fuck who wants me.  I'll turn down them all.  I hope Carson's reborn.  I can break his balls.  They're full of shit.  So if I did it all.  You can't quit.  The only thing I gotta do, I'm jealous of this son of my God, Norton, because he lost  weight.  He did.  Well, he's lonely. 
[00:05:00]  What the fuck?  Yeah, everyone's lonely.  But they're getting a cat, you see.  I know.  You should get a cat.  I'm a bird.  A bird is always good.  I don't need to go back.  A bird.  A bird is terrible.  A bird.  Birds saved us years ago.  We all had canaries because we thought of this gas.  The bird dies.  We were fucking killers.  We were killing fucking birds.  Ah, the pork birds.  You know, you don't do that.  No.  That's what we do.  We kill you fucking birds.  Wait, are you really?  You retired?  For real?  One more time I come over, they have to break the sack at first.  We don't like this news. 
[00:05:30]  My altar God.  Yes.  Steve, what's going on?  Get on the mic real fast.  I don't want to do it no more.  I did it all.  There's no more mountains to climb.  That's the end of it.  And there's a man, my buddy, right there.  He'll tell you.  I talked to him outside the studio.  He's very depressed.  That's one of the reasons.  They want me on a cruise.  That's when I know it's fucking over.  Oh, Jesus.  I'd rather be on a raft than drown.  Can't you get bigger?  Even if the notes you wrote are too small to read, can't you just get a bigger cue card? 
[00:06:00]  If they get any fucking bigger, they won't see me.  What the fuck is he telling me?  I know comics.  Look, we're all joking aside.  You're a comic, and you're a great guy, and a great comic.  Thank you.  Without rhythm, you're shit.  Comedy is rhythm.  When I know on a stage that my rhythm is not rhyming, I say, before I turn around and  have people say, you know, you don't get the message, listen, I'm 85 in my 85th year.  God bless.  Thank you.  Where the fuck are you going to go? 
[00:06:30]  You know, I saw God love Henry Youngman.  I saw him, and I loved him, walking on with a wheelchair, trying to read the cards, and  I said, that's not going to happen.  I got my dignity.  Forget comedy.  Forget all that shit.  Dignity.  You got dignity.  You'll get it.  It'll be a Thursday one after you get a cramp in your balls.  I got dignity.  But he has the rhythm and the timing still, Steve.  No.  Everyone hears it.  Don't tell me about my fucking comedy.  Let me explain something to you.  I thought it was being nice.  24-7, I can do this.  It's easy. 
[00:07:00]  I don't have to worry what I'm going to say.  I never had that.  But I don't want to go on a stage now saying, I can't say that shit no more.  But now I don't believe it.  How many times can you repeat this shit?  And I'm good.  I ate new stuff.  But I would walk out there and say, let me see.  Where am I going to go?  Why should I torture myself?  I made a good dollar.  I mean, I can't complain.  I'm looking good for a guy 85.  Yeah.  I mean, I'm going to lose weight now.  Maybe that's why he's successful.  The fuck do I know?  How about a podcast?  The sign that you got in that place there, put it out so we can see it. 
[00:07:30]  That you sold that out.  What sign?  You got a sign.  It's all over here.  Oh, in Cal.  That's an old one.  No, no.  You got to take it home because it's embarrassing.  I was there that night.  You didn't sell it.  No, I meant I sold out artistically.  I love you, man.  No, Pat.  Why not a podcast?  Pat Cooper, you can do a podcast where you talk for an hour about anything you want into  a microphone and it gets downloaded.  You are made for a fucking podcast.  Pat Cooper would do an amazing podcast.  Let's do it. 
[00:08:00]  A podcast.  What?  What?  A podcast.  It's like a radio show.  Uh-oh.  But you're just talking and it's recording and it's a one-hour block of just you talking  and people download it on iTunes.  You would be fucking great at it.  Your podcast would be...  Who listens to that?  A lot of people.  Oh, my God.  A lot of people.  A lot of people listen to them.  They're fucking huge.  Why am I listening to you?  You're a failure.  I don't fucking...  You're a failure.  This is...  No, but you know something?  Yeah, yes. 
[00:08:30]  Joe Rivers has the thing, you know, the television, you know...  A telepromp.  He has that.  That's okay.  But you know something?  I feel bad that I'm letting me down that I'm better than reading that shit.  You know, I don't want to read that.  And particularly if some of the material that they say, when are you going to do the thing  about that?  And that's...  I don't want to do the thing about that.  I don't want to do that anymore.  I want to go out and just take chances.  But when people are paying, say, $40, $50 to see you, I don't want them to gamble on  my bullshit.  So I said, hey, you know something?  Stop.  And I stop.  And I'm okay. 
[00:09:00]  How long has he stopped for, Steve?  About a month.  Three months?  Four months?  Yes, four months.  People...  I got shit.  I got an offer.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Do you miss it?  Do you miss it?  No, let me tell you something.  Because it's not fun anymore.  Let me tell you something.  This is another reason.  All right.  Patty, how are you?  I'm very sad.  How are you?  How are you?  Patty, you can't quit.  Why?  Listen to me.  Your public wants you.  Where the fuck is my public?  What do you mean they want me?  I got a job here, Patty.  Okay.  How much?  Well, you know, things are tough. 
[00:09:30]  Oh, jeez.  They're tough?  Did I cause the toughness?  How come the congressman don't call me if I'm a fuck-up?  I said, how much?  Because, Patty, I'm embarrassed to tell you.  Do what the fuck you call me for?  I'm not going to do it.  I'm not going to do it, Patty.  You know, you do it.  You just say, this is my last.  I don't want to tell people.  Yeah.  Now they want to have a big party.  Sure.  The final.  You know what I'll do?  I'm going to do it.  Yeah.  The next day, I'm going to go back to show business.  That's what I'm going to do.  That's how you fuck them. 
[00:10:00]  Then I can do it again.  I'm going to retire in another three days.  That's my talent.  He retires for a living.  I don't like this.  I don't like this at all.  If you get sick of the material, if you get sick of saying the same stuff, I go out and  I do cheap tickets.  I'll do really cheap tickets and tell the crowd, I'm working on material.  So they come knowing that they're watching a process.  Nobody knows you with that shit.  But I mean, it feels good, though, to do that.  I made big albums, you sick fuck.  Big albums.  Who the fuck wants to hear it?  It's not that.  I never did the exact same thing in a row. 
[00:10:30]  I'll get a little bit of a tirade.  It makes you feel good.  Yeah.  But it's not fun no more to get on that stage and need help.  You know, it's like if someone says, Pat, you walk and go, here, here's a crutch.  And I say, no, I don't need the crutch.  I'm old enough to walk.  So I want to, I'm okay.  I'm not looking for nothing.  You know, I got a couple of grandkids and family there.  So that's it.  I got, you know, Steve who helps me.  And I got another friend, Johnny Golasio, who helps me.  And when you start asking people, I need somebody to help me. 
[00:11:00]  That's being smart.  I could say, well, I feel good.  I'm all right.  I need somebody to answer my phones because who the fuck wants to listen?  I need somebody to take me to the doctor.  He takes me to the doctor.  You know, I feel good.  I mean, and I don't say to them, you know, he's got dignity.  I pay him.  The fuck?  I pay him and he calls me, Pat, you're all right?  And nothing's wrong with him.  The doctor keeps saying there's nothing wrong with you.  You know, you do that.  Oh, boy.  Except you can't hear.  I appreciate this.  No, you're working for me.  But I don't say you got to do this, you got to do that.  He calls me every day because I had that clicker.  I just called to see if he's alive. 
[00:11:30]  I had to click, you know.  The life call.  No, the woman that fell down.  I can't get up.  I can't get up.  Right, right.  I fell down.  I said, I can't get up.  And the guy said, I'm on lunch.  Back in a half hour, I'm on lunch.  You know, I see the funny things like you do.  I'm sure you see television.  He should throw that out or throw this in.  And, you know, that's why I love guys like him.  He's incognito.  He'll always be a star.  See, me, I was never a star.  I was a name.  And I tell most of the comics, don't fuck stardom. 
[00:12:00]  Get the money.  Get the money.  And get your reputation.  Now, when I went on Snyder years ago, if I would have went on Snyder today, I'd have had a reality show.  Because they called me a prick, a big mouth, a piece of shit.  I said, you fucking nuts.  Somebody was taking my dignity.  I defended it.  That you weren't on television.  Yeah.  And it was my mother.  Yeah, a lot of attack her too.  What the fuck is this?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And now, they're all doing it.  Everybody's doing it.  Sister's saying, you know, you're a cunt.  You're a fucking cunt. 
[00:12:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  On television.  But that's what it is.  When I said to go back to here, Patty blew it.  We better make some phone calls, talk to the boys or calm them down.  Boys are worse than I am.  The fuck you're calling them to the boys?  How about the girls?  Even the girls, the mafia woman.  You see cement?  Mary Cement?  A grenade would turn her down.  A fucking grenade.  I never saw ugly like that in my fucking life.  Did you see that face?  I would go to jail with a smile.  What a fucking smile.  Prettier people in jail than her.  I don't like this. 
[00:13:00]  Mary happiness.  How about, I like the idea.  The world needs Pat Cooper still.  A reality show.  Would you do a reality show?  You'd be perfect.  No, this to me is reality.  I'm trying to.  How many times have I done it?  Five, six times?  I've been trying to help you.  They said, you'll scare these guys.  I don't want to scare you.  You've got no children.  I feel like you're my family.  Yes.  Every time I see her coming around the corner by the footlong, you're a footlong fucko.  You know, and he just says, Pat, we really miss you.  And the baby spits at me.  Takes answers.  Old man.  You're a good happy guy.  I pray every day for you. 
[00:13:30]  Not him, because he's got a cat.  I'm a cat.  He's got companies.  I'm a cat now.  But you've got two children.  God bless you.  Three and one.  Did I nail it?  For what?  Your kids.  What?  Oh, three and one.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  One is three and one is one.  I'm amazed.  How does he know that?  He has a memory.  He keeps the...  When he's not working, you don't see Opie.  Shh.  Uh-huh.  He walks like with a little fucking strut.  A little swagger.  He's got a swagger.  I go, oh, you're dying.  She goes, isn't he wonderful? 
[00:14:00]  I go, oh, Jesus Christ.  Isn't he wonderful?  And then Mr. Happiness comes along.  I go, how you doing?  He goes, none of your fucking business.  Oh, Jimmy, Jimmy.  You know, you look great.  I tease you guys.  Just speak.  Don't over fucking do it.  Don't be a fucking Cary Grant.  You're ugly.  Let's go.  We all live in the same neighborhood.  We haven't seen Pat in a while.  Pat lives a block away from me.  We don't see Pat anymore.  How many times I've said to you, make me an irregular. 
[00:14:30]  Anybody can be a regular.  Right, right.  Put me on every day.  You are an irregular.  Yeah, that's what I...  But who gets these kind of fucking lives?  Who?  No one.  Nobody.  I don't come here with a fucking top hat.  I don't come here with tattoos.  I don't come here with a fucking attitude.  I'm fucking dynamite.  Pat, I got to ask you, though.  You retire.  What are you going to do with yourself?  Why, you want to know?  Yeah.  That's easy.  What?  That's easy.  Torture people like you.  I made a lot of money.  Wait a minute.  I made a lot of money.  Uh-huh. 
[00:15:00]  Okay?  And I didn't turn around and play the part.  Sure.  I was married 45 years, and I saved.  My wife saved at this.  She saved.  When she died, I didn't know I was wealthy.  Oh, jeez.  Then I was wondering why the fucking mattress was high and one was high and low on the other.  She saved my ass, because I don't know how to...  I didn't give my fucking money away.  Right, right.  She saved my ass.  Obviously.  Gave two grand to that chick at the Apple store.  Steve looked me up in the computer.  He said, I understand you're worth 15 million.  I didn't know I was worth 15 million.  I called my accountant.  I said, I'm worth 15 million.  She said, Steve is full of shit.  Steve is full of shit. 
[00:15:30]  15 million.  Who the fuck looks at that?  I know how much you're worth.  Now with the cat, you're going to...  Well, the cat food is expensive.  You have to write the cat off.  It's called pussy time.  Is that it?  I can write the cat off as pussy time?  Do you have...  You're not married, are you?  No.  Smart.  Yeah.  He was, though.  He was.  Yeah, I know that.  We don't want to go into that, but see, let me explain something to you.  When you're down to animals, next you're going to take a safari.  No safari.  You're going to start to feel mother nature.  With a face like that, you need a fucking wall.  I mean, look, all due respect to Don Rickles. 
[00:16:00]  I love Don Rickles.  Sure.  I cry at Don Rickles.  He's one of the best.  He was.  I love him.  But he's walking on the stage.  He's not...  He's not all there.  And I'm saying, what the fuck?  Yeah, yeah.  You're not con.  We tire.  And he could tell me, mind my business, and he would be right.  But I say, no.  You know, you're special.  He's special.  But it seems to me that work, this work has...  That's what keeps you going.  That's your drive in life.  Have you seen him when he got up the stage?  He ain't going nowhere.  No, I mean you.  Because of my yarn.  They said, you just got off.  But the work has kept you going over the years. 
[00:16:30]  No, no.  Now, relaxing.  I want to go to Italy.  This is relaxing.  I want to go to Italy with a blind girl and tell her I'm Cary Grant.  That's all I want.  I want to spend money and go out there and get some money.  I gave...  I'm not bragging.  I gave $100,000 to St. Jude for my wife's family.  Oh, there you go.  But now my daughter's suing me.  So what does that tell you?  Oh, Jesus.  I'm kidding.  Oh, well, I hope not.  So you want to go to Italy?  I'd like to go to Italy with somebody that likes to go with me.  I mean, Steve, you know, he's Jewish. 
[00:17:00]  It's a little heavy day to take him to Italy because he don't know what the fuck is going on.  He doesn't understand a yarmulke.  There was a fedora.  I'm getting one bit out of hair so I can wear a fedora.  No, but I would like to go, you know, with a guy, a girl.  I don't want no sexual shit.  Sure, sure.  But you know something?  It's not going to happen.  No?  No fucking way.  Make it happen.  That's the reality show.  That's the reality show.  Oh, my God.  Pat Cooper is going places.  Right.  And you fucking send Pat places with a camera crew.  And he fucking walks around and he explores places. 
[00:17:30]  You're just walking with Pat.  And he talks.  And he meets people.  Oh, imagine that.  And he's hilarious.  He can nap at 2 o'clock.  Literally, we already have the show.  I get up at 3 and I go to bed.  That's why you look good.  Why don't you tell him what Richard Lewis said about you?  Oh.  Richard Lewis.  I don't see him that often.  Wrote him a fan letter.  Yeah, I don't know.  He calls me to a friend.  He says, Pat.  And he says, Richard Lewis has got to tell you something.  And I know him for, you know, I've known him over the years.  And I wasn't like hanging out with him.  Like, I know him, but, you know, I consider him a friend.  But I don't, I'm not around him all the time. 
[00:18:00]  And he says, Pat, let me tell you something.  And I said, Rich, what is?  That doesn't call me a piece of shit or something.  He said, nobody holds a microphone like you.  And I says, oh, you know, I had paralysis.  You know, he goes, Pat.  And he went on and he said, I was the best ever.  He said, nobody can shine your shoes.  He said, that's coming from me.  I seen you everywhere.  That's that.  You're un-fucking-believable.  Well, that was nice.  And then I stood there and I go, I better quit now that I'm ahead. 
[00:18:30]  You know.  So he said, another comment.  Norton has never said that.  He just said hi one time.  So I said to Richie, he wrote me a letter and he told me.  And that's nice coming from a fellow.  You know, a fellow comedian.  And I never looked at it that way.  But I know I'm a little special than the average because I, like he says, I took chances.  Yeah.  I did take chances.  And, you know, you're not supposed to take chances.  I did.  Because when you fuck with your dignity, that's all we own. 
[00:19:00]  Jesus Christ.  I mean, you look around and see a guy like Rickles.  All the wonderful things.  I look at him.  I go, Jesus Christ.  What a wonderful career.  And then I see him walking with a limp.  It bothers me because I think he's special.  And he should now maybe retire.  Because I don't think he's all there the way I would like him to be all there.  Because there's no more.  He actually believes there's an Eskimo in the audience.  There's no Eskimo.  There's a guy sucking on an ice pot.  The Eskimo.  He now believes there is an Eskimo.  It's the problem.  You know, and I say that about a lot of these guys. 
[00:19:30]  You know, we're all old.  I mean, George Burns, and no disrespect.  I worked with him.  I worked for him in Reno.  And it's a wonderful thing.  But people are paying to see if they're going to be at the show where he's going to die.  Oh, damn.  It's the truth.  I think you're right.  It is true.  I'm saying with Sinatra.  Well, Sinatra fell in Rhode Island in the dead and around.  Guy said, I was close by.  He looked like he was going to die.  His eye turned blue.  He said, well, he started throwing up.  He just fainted this poor fuck.  But they wanted to say I was dead when he died.  Right.  You don't have to worry about that.  You want to know when I die, I'll call you. 
[00:20:00]  That's all.  The worst of the week countdown.  Countdown.  Obi and Anthony were both out earlier this week.  But Jim was in.  I was in.  Jim Florentine stopped by.  And we were joined by Tom Arnold.  There have been very few guests that were as immediately open, candid, and fun as Tom Arnold was.  He likes to eat asshole.  I suppose.  You want evidence?  Listen to this.  Tom Arnold on the countdown. 
[00:20:30]  Tom Arnold is here.  Who I like.  I don't even know what Tom is promoting.  He's got gigs coming up.  Oh, he does.  I just like Tom.  Hi, Tom.  We're on the air.  So, you know.  Welcome.  They're getting me some tea.  Hi.  That's fine.  Some tea for your voice.  Yeah.  Oh, is this on?  It is, yeah.  Can I put my Nicorette right here?  Yeah, sure.  Thank you.  How many pieces is that? 
[00:21:00]  That's three, four milligram pieces.  I was on four, four milligrams.  But I'm cutting down.  I've been on it for 10 years, and I never smoked.  I thought you were fucking serious.  I'm like, oh, he's psychotic.  I smoked a lot of cigars, and then I had to quit one day to do this job.  And I quit that day, and I chew this, and it's the same thing.  It's the same drug as cigarettes or cigars, and it's just that I'm addicted to this now.  Yeah, yeah.  Rich Voss, our friend, is hooked on the gum.  The gum is hard to get off.  It is really hard. 
[00:21:30]  Okay.  Yeah.  I'm down to 12 milligrams 10 times a day.  I never liked it.  I tried it once when I was still smoking, and I was taking a long flight, and it just fucking  tasted like pepper.  It's better now.  I have to say, when was this when you tried it?  Oh, I quit smoking 10 years ago, so probably late 90s.  They come out with much better flavors.  Yeah, I'll give you some if you want to.  No, no.  No, no, no.  But does it feel like you're smoking?  It does.  Whatever.  As a recovering drug addict, I know it gives you that same drug.  You know, if you're addicted to morphine, and you chew morphine gum, it would give you 
[00:22:00]  the same drug, and that's what that does.  Because I noticed the way I did it was I did the patch, and I did it for exactly the  right amount of time.  It was one of the few things I actually followed the instructions on, and I wound up, I was  drinking a lot of water, and I realized I'm making the hand-to-mouth motion.  That's what most of it is.  It was that fucking motion.  Yeah.  And also, you have to step out a little bit, especially with cigars, but also cigarettes.  You can't be around people as much, so you get to have a little private time. 
[00:22:30]  Oh, I need to go do this thing that's just me.  Right.  And so it's an excuse to socially sort of step out, or to smoke with people.  I don't know what it is.  It's not just physiological.  Does it give you energy, too?  I think it does.  You know, I try not to drink caffeine now.  I have one tea in the morning.  I used to drink 12 to 20 Diet Cokes.  Now I don't.  It's bad for your sperm count.  20 Diet Cokes?  Yes.  A day you would drink?  Yeah.  I worked a long day.  Is it bad for your sperm? 
[00:23:00]  It is.  Those chemicals that make it...  Aspartame?  Fattening.  Aspartame.  Aspartame.  Yeah, that's horrible.  It's like poison, I'm told.  Well, it's also, yeah, very...  Cancer and rats.  I mean, it's very...  Right.  There's definite connections to cancer with aspartame.  It definitely affects the sperm count, though.  I didn't know that.  That almost makes you want to keep drinking it, because I like to dump inside,  so the less sperm I have, the better.  That's true.  Well, then you should definitely do that.  Instead of getting a vasectomy, just drink a lot of diet.  Or just being a responsible adult wearing a condom every once in a while.  Yeah.  Well, I think we understand that's not going to happen. 
[00:23:30]  That's the great thing about being married, is you can dump inside, as you say so eloquently.  See, I'm married.  Me and my wife still wear a bag.  Because you're fertile?  Yeah.  Oh, well, yeah.  We're trying to make more.  We just said I have a six-month-old, and it took me so long, 23 years, to get a woman  pregnant.  Oh, okay.  Yeah.  And we want to do it one more time, so we're trying.  All right.  Well, that's different, though.  If you're married, and that's what you want.  Right.  It's different than me, just being single and hoping that she isn't. 
[00:24:00]  Have you never gotten anybody pregnant?  Not to my knowledge.  I had one girl tell me that I had gotten her pregnant, and that she got an abortion, but  I didn't believe her.  I think she was lying for attention, because it was so long after the fact.  Are you sure your sperm is okay?  I've never tested it.  Let's hope not.  I mean, believe me.  I hope they fucking stumble and go the wrong way.  It's the last thing I want.  I never did either, until a couple years ago, either.  Never got a girl pregnant.  Right.  And I slipped up on bags a lot.  Yeah.  Well, it seems like it's harder and harder to get people pregnant in our environment or 
[00:24:30]  whatever it is.  And so, you know, a lot of my friends that are younger are going to this nut doctor that  teaches you how to keep your...  In case you do want to have a kid one day, and then you freeze it, and then you have  it, which you might want to do.  Sure.  And then when you're ready to go, they just put it in your wife.  Oh, wow.  So you can get a vasectomy?  Yes.  The only reason I don't have a vasectomy is I like to shoot, like, a good amount, and  I was always afraid a vasectomy would stop that and make my loads smaller.  No.  It's the same.  A couple friends have gotten vasectomies. 
[00:25:00]  Loads don't change.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Okay.  Because there's something about the punishment element that I like.  Yeah, the only thing, you can't whack your bag for a couple days after vasectomy, that  could be a problem for you.  That's fine.  Don't you hate it when you're almost ready to cum, and you kind of fuck it up, like you're  trying to extend that almost period a little bit, and you fuck it up so your cum is not  that good.  It's sort of in the middle ground, like you're there, and then you go back a little bit,  and you get a little too greedy.  Yes.  Oh, I hate that.  Dude, it's funny you say that, because I edge a lot.  That happens when you're edging.  Yes.  And you're stopping and starting and stopping.  And I came the other night, and when you cum, as it's happening, you feel it. 
[00:25:30]  You know that half of it's going to stay in your balls, and it's going to ache.  Yes.  A lousy almost stopped.  It's almost like getting an infield single, even though it counts as a single.  Right.  A sharp base hit up the middle.  A squibbler.  It's like you got on, but it's cheap.  Right.  It doesn't feel right.  It looks, in the box score, you blew a load.  Right.  The best cum I ever had, back in the 80s, I did a lot of cocaine, and I'd stay up for five  days at a time.  And then, I could never have sex when I was on cocaine, but after the five days, I've 
[00:26:00]  slept for 48 hours, wake up, and then you're super horny, or you get a boner, and then you  jerk off.  That cum, from the five day up thing, that is the best.  So if you ever want to cum really good, do a lot of cocaine for five days, and then jerk  off.  Or if you just hold out and don't jerk off for a few days.  Yeah.  Sometimes you take a little hiatus.  It's always better.  Yeah.  That's true.  Did you ever have girls in a room where you couldn't get an erection when you were on  coke?  Absolutely.  Well, I mean, I think, I hate to talk about this, but I think my ex-wife, Roseanne, would 
[00:26:30]  probably say, because I was so, she didn't know I was doing cocaine, and so I'd be hiding  it, even though I was staying up all the time.  Right.  But I would go to work every day on the show.  She thought you were ambitious.  Yeah, yeah.  And sweating.  But then she would want to have sex, and I could, I knew I couldn't.  And this is before they had boner pills, like they do now.  This is like 1989.  So I would, it was pretty shameful.  By, by, you know, I'd hide from her. 
[00:27:00]  I would try to do it.  I would try to do it, and it wouldn't work.  And so.  And she feels guilty like every woman.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's one of the shittiest things that you could do to somebody, and I did that to her.  Or, you know, she would find cocaine, and I'd say, that's not mine in my wallet.  Right.  That's the kids, or the housekeeper, I don't know.  But you shame, you're such an asshole.  And then, so she would feel she was crazy.  And, you know.  You never just ate her box just to hold her over?  Well, I'd do whatever.  If I could get away with that, I would do that for whatever, and hopefully she'd fall asleep. 
[00:27:30]  But I couldn't get a boner.  And I have a lot of friends that get super boners on cocaine, but it was, it never worked for me, literally.  Me neither.  And, well, but what, the thing is, the woman starts to feel like it's her fault, and you have to start making excuses.  Like, no, I'm just tired.  It's like, so what would you tell her?  Because you couldn't be honest and go, look, it's the coke.  Right.  So what would you say?  I would just say, I don't know what's going on.  I mean, I'm stressed, whatever.  You know, and it got so intense.  And right before I went into rehab, like, that was the lie I couldn't physically keep maintaining. 
[00:28:00]  I mean, that was part of, so, yeah, when I, the night I told her,  which was December 10th, 1989, which is crazy to remember.  Part of it was, this is why I haven't been able to get an erection or have sex,  and you've been through all this shit this fall.  It's because of me.  I've lied.  And that relief of not having to lie about that also again was pretty wonderful.  So, you know, there's so much shame involved, especially with sex. 
[00:28:30]  I'm sure she felt shame that this guy that she loves and loves her wasn't able to do this.  I mean, sometimes I could, and then I would fake.  I could never come.  So I'd have to fake that, you know.  How did you fake it?  Just by pretending, like, oh, that's amazing.  It's a, you know.  Very believable, Tom.  I'm sure I was sweating so much on her that it seemed like I came up.  Right, that she was just like, oh, this place is off me.  You know, do this thing.  I did it with other women, too, where I'm like, let me work on you first. 
[00:29:00]  Yeah, all of course.  You know, and then hopefully she'll come before we have intercourse, and then I won't have  to deal with it.  Do all the pressure's off.  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's the best.  And there's so much shame when you can't get a rod for a guy, because, you know, like,  if a woman can't get wet, we just, you lick your fingers, you use your mouth.  It's not a big deal.  Squirt some stuff in there.  Right.  Yeah, yeah.  But if we can't, there's so much fucking shame around it.  And that thinking about it makes it so you can't, I mean, it's a, wow, it's a tough  one.  Yeah, it is.  And I've had it happen sober.  I've had it happen when I was, you know, because I'm sober a while, so it still happens. 
[00:29:30]  Because you're high, but when you're not high, a lot of times you're going, I don't want  to have sex right now.  But men don't know how to say that.  We don't know how to go.  Right.  I'm just not in that kind of mood right now.  Right.  So our body just shuts down and goes, you're not fucking right now.  Right.  Exactly.  It's hard for us to admit that.  I'm always, because we had a baby, so I'm like, I'm on call.  Anytime you're ready to go, let me know.  But even then, she's like, okay, let's do it.  I'm like, what the fuck?  Slow down.  Yeah, I'm not ready.  Just let me get a second.  Let me get my thoughts together.  Let me see what I'm going to focus on here.  How have you navigated? 
[00:30:00]  Because I joke a lot about people in my age group, I'm 45, who are having trouble with  Facebook and all this stuff and porn.  To balance this new technology, this everything available is brutal.  Right.  And I've had a hard time with balancing the pornography and what's real in relationships.  It's been very fucking hard to not just go right to the porn.  Right.  I don't do porn.  I don't need it.  I would in a heartbeat.  If it comes up, I'll watch it.  But I just have these thoughts in my head of things I've seen.  I've been to Mommy and Me class, maybe. 
[00:30:30]  And all the ladies sit around, and you're in a circle, and they're all super smoking hot.  Yeah.  I hate to talk.  Now I'm in trouble.  But you get those thoughts in your head, or somebody's at a bus stop, and they're bending  over.  Yeah.  It just sticks with you.  And then you pull that out when you need to.  We have pictures on the walls that are artistic, but if you squint a little bit, they're very  sexy.  Well, that's a great thing when you're jerking off to, like, a Van Gogh.  Yes.  Hopefully not a Norman Rockwell.  Hopefully not a kid running away from home. 
[00:31:00]  So I would do that, too, in school, where you start filing things away, and you're like,  I'm going to jerk to her.  Yeah.  They were the best when you could go back and just relive those little bend over.  Or somebody touched you.  Oh, yeah.  Like, we were sitting sort of spread and legged in a circle on Friday, and a lady straight  across from me, I wasn't, I'm not trying to creep on anybody, because I got my baby there,  and I could see up her whatever.  Yeah.  And she made eye contact with me, and then she pulled her shirt all the way down to her  knees, which I felt terrible about. 
[00:31:30]  But then in my mind, I kept thinking about that, like, what did I miss?  Yeah.  I should have taken a great look.  You know, those accidental, I was at the Four Seasons, and this woman came out, it was  early morning, and I could tell she'd been up all night, and I made a joke, because she  looked kind of, like, still drunk, and she was like, fuck you, and she got into the cab,  and she put her legs on the ground, and she looked straight at me, and she spread her  legs, I could see she didn't have any underwear on, and she was, like, kind of giving me the  finger, and I was like, that is fucking hot.  Was she mad at you, or was she being playful? 
[00:32:00]  Well, she was, thought I, she did not appreciate me making jokes.  Okay.  But whatever she did, I think she was pretty mad, but it was wonderful.  Oh, that's hot, man.  That is so hot, because it was, like, accidental, and she had pubic hair, which I fucking love.  You do?  I do.  I go back and forth.  Yeah, I don't want any part of it.  Yeah, none?  Zero?  Yeah, I mean, now that I'm used to not having any, I don't want any down there.  Well, that's, I can't, you know, when I watch porn, and I do at the hotel, like,  I'm late last night, I don't like to see penises, and I do like to see a little bit  of pubic hair.  But not the, a lot of the girls are going to the regular bush now. 
[00:32:30]  Oh, they aren't.  Are they, really?  You see it in the porn sites, yeah.  Yeah, I've seen a couple.  Not fully, but, I mean, just covering the whole.  Have you ever been with a woman that never has shaved?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, a couple of them.  Once in a while, it can be sexy, but it's very rare that I'll think that's sexy.  Normally, I find it apish, but occasionally, once, it's just, it can be different.  Or hair on those nipples.  It's musty because of all the hair, and it's sweaty.  Here's where you see those women.  You're getting a massage at a regular massage place, and, you know, all of a sudden you start  thinking, whenever I get a massage anywhere, I start thinking, what if this goes sideways 
[00:33:00]  and good?  Of course, yeah.  If, in the once every 10 years that it does go, that's when you see those crazy bushes,  because they're all natural, a lot of them are natural women, and that's when you're  like, holy fuck, you know, you've got to find your way around, man.  And, but then.  Like, yeah, vegan tantric massage, doing that type of stuff.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm going to help heal you, and you get a fucking rod when you hear that word.  Oh, no shit.  But I don't like the hip hair on the nipple.  That's not for me.  Hairy armpits, occasionally, I've had, if a girl doesn't wear deodorant, and it doesn't  smell like a man smell, because that would gross me out. 
[00:33:30]  There's something about a fucking sweaty woman armpit that could be a fucking animal  and hot.  I get that.  Feet that smell a little bit, not dirty, but a little stinky.  Because they can never be as stinky as we get.  Never.  Because when we get stinky, we get super stinky.  Yeah.  I like that.  No, I like them fresh.  You do?  I do like them fresh.  Yeah, right out of the shower, I'm right, yeah.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't like any smells.  I get weird with smells.  Yeah.  But the smell is what fucking gives you a boner.  You have the animal inside of you.  Yes, yes. 
[00:34:00]  No, not me.  No, not you.  No, I don't like perfumes either.  I hate when chicks wear a lot of perfume.  I'm not into that.  But yeah, just out of the shower, just out of the towel, fucking I'm in.  I just worry about, do I smell?  That's my main thing.  You know, I always like to be out of the shower myself.  And then I start thinking, do I smell?  Is this okay?  You know, I'm more insecure about myself.  Yeah, because that's like, if I eat a girl's ass, I like it to have like a little bit.  Again, I don't want to still.  What did you say eat ass?  Do you mean the vagina or the actual asshole?  Oh, the asshole.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I'll do that. 
[00:34:30]  Sure.  I love doing that.  Of course.  But I don't need her right out of the shower.  But I don't want it dirty.  Yeah.  Like, not that extreme.  But just like a little bit like a fucking.  What if you just dance with her for two hours in a club?  That's, I would prefer to.  I don't even dance, but I would want to dance first to get her sweaty.  What if you get a little toilet paper on there?  Like a little piece of your head?  That I wouldn't like.  No, that I wouldn't like.  I was with a buddy of mine once.  We were having kind of a threesome where I was watching him.  He had his, Bob Kelly, he had his foot up against the wall and he was getting his ass  eaten by a girl.  And she said, I'm whacking off on the couch watching.  And I heard her go. 
[00:35:00]  And she spit out a piece of toilet paper.  I'll never forget that.  As long as I live, I'll never forget that.  And she went right back in?  Right back in.  She's a fucking true boy.  Bob was handsome back then.  Bob was handsome.  She's a trooper.  Yeah, she's a good girl.  But yeah, I like my ass eating.  I like doing it.  But again.  What about you, Tom?  I love it.  Absolutely love it.  Doing it or getting it done?  Both.  Yeah.  But I prefer getting it done.  You know, I like it.  I like to be touched there.  You know, I like that.  That'd be great.  It doesn't happen a lot once you're married.  Yeah.  Right.  It doesn't.  That's more against you. 
[00:35:30]  But it should happen once.  You know, because everything should happen once with your wife.  But no, she's not.  And it's hard to ask for.  You can't ask a girl.  Oh, I ask directly.  In an inappropriate way.  Fuck it.  Eventually, you have that argument where you put it all out there.  God damn it.  Just lick my fucking asshole one time.  Other people have done it.  You don't want to say that.  Right.  But, you know, it just means a lot.  Maybe you don't need it all the time because you'll remember that time.  Yeah.  I did have the argument once with a girlfriend.  It was a girlfriend whose ass I would eat.  And she just didn't go near a man's ass.  That's true.  My last girlfriend, you know. 
[00:36:00]  Right.  We had that discussion in the first month of our relationship.  And eventually, she started doing it.  And it was more on principle for her.  Like, she was like, oh, yeah.  I'm not going to eat a guy's ass.  Like, it was that weird stubbornness.  Women have that.  I'm clean, though.  Like, I make that.  I make sure I'm showered.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  It's not about disrespecting her and having a dirty ass and saying, I dominate you.  Lick my ass.  Because some guys are like that.  And that's the problem because there's so many asshole guys out there that ruin it for us  that just want to get our asses licked like a human being.  Right.  And be treated like somebody that you care about and love. 
[00:36:30]  Nothing says I love you more than that.  It's just a wonderful body thing.  It really is true.  It's absolutely true.  I love converting a girl that doesn't.  I've never had that done.  I don't want.  I don't want that.  I go, just let me try.  Right.  And they're like, holy shit.  And then they want it done all the time.  Right.  Yeah.  Hopefully by you.  Well, whoever.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe converting them.  Yeah.  That's great.  I just want to.  Yeah.  I just want to be the first one to get in there and then set them on their way.  Do you keep a record of that?  No.  But, you know, I got it in my head.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We all do.  I'm like a numbers guy in the 30s.  All up here.  Yeah.  I mean, you probably know how many different girls asses you've eaten. 
[00:37:00]  That's true.  Like that's one you can go back.  All right.  Well, that way.  All right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's where, you know, you get into a point where you're just too perverted, though.  When you start meeting women that you've met online or massage, you said massages.  Massage is a very intimate thing.  They are.  It's fucking nice.  Yeah.  I was in Minneapolis, and this woman, it was probably 72, I would guess, and she had  the full uniform on, like the white pants, the white whatever, and the towel was moving  around a little bit, and I got a boner, and I was thinking, would I let, because she 
[00:37:30]  was not going to, she was like a, I don't know if she was a lesbian, but she had short  man hair, which a lot of women in the Midwest do, and gray, but I thought, well, if it did  go down, it would be okay with me, 100% okay, and this is like 15 years ago, so 72 now,  that's like close to my age, so I mean, up here.  But it didn't go down?  It didn't go down.  But I almost came, and I thought, because sometimes when you cum accidentally, that freaks  them out.  I've never cum accidentally.  How do you do that from a...  Well, just if it's rubbing the right way, and you think they're doing it to you, because 
[00:38:00]  the ridge of the sheet is rubbing the head of your dick, you think they're doing that  on purpose, and then you cum, and they're like, I'm going to excuse myself for a minute  while you get cleaned up, and I'm like, oh shit, I thought you were into that.  But either way, you got to cum, so who cares?  Yeah.  I got one recently.  Wow, you're hitting on some really good stuff.  I got one recently where the girl didn't do happy endings, and I knew she did, and like  you're laying on your back, and your arms are on the massage table, so she's standing there,  and she moves my one arm, so her crotch won't be pressed against my arm, and she's massaging 
[00:38:30]  me legit.  Right.  But on the other side, she didn't move my arm, and I could just feel her, like the front  of her thighs in pants against my hand, and it was driving me crazy, and she has her  one palm on my stomach, and she's rubbing down my leg.  But it was hitting the edge of my cock, and it was through a sheet, and I was like, oh  my God, and I fucking, I started to get hard, and I flexed it a little bit, and she didn't  move, and I'm like, oh, she's going to fucking jerk me.  But then she moved her hand and didn't address it again, so I think it legitimately wasn't  something she was thinking of, but it turned me on so much, the innocence of that happening 
[00:39:00]  was fucking hot.  And how much, I hope they know how much power they have.  Oh, God, yeah.  Because we don't get boners intentionally to, you know, to do something.  Sometimes it just happens.  And, you know, I've had them actually take my penis and move it to the side.  Oh, yeah, I like that.  Like, they've seen, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Really?  I'll take even that.  Yeah.  I hate when they negotiate when they have it in your hand.  Like, all right, how much?  Yeah.  And they're holding it.  I'm like, I just fucking take my wallet.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll take care of you.  Yeah.  Fucking make it.  I don't even need a massage. 
[00:39:30]  Because once you get jerked off, you don't need a massage.  No, not at all.  I've had guys that are so confident they're going to get jerked off, they do it up front,  and then they sit there and get a fucking hour and a half massage.  Whereas, you know, it's always, unless you hire a person specifically for that.  Sure.  But you can't get a great jerk off and a great massage, I don't find.  I know there's somebody somewhere.  Yeah.  But usually they're good at one or the other.  So to find someone that does both is pretty sweet, and you want to hold on to that person.  I've gotten a few really good combinations. 
[00:40:00]  Most times, though, you're right, that does not happen.  But if they move your dick to the side, if they touch your dick and move it,  that is an indicator that they're going to do something.  Maybe let you jerk it.  A lot of times they might not.  But if they touch your cock and move it, there's something really sexy about just them touching it.  I had one girl, oh, my God, in the Midwest years ago, she was massaging me, and I had  like a half a rod, and she took my dick and she kind of threw it to the side, oh, like  fucking disdainfully, but I knew she was being, like, dirty.  Right.  So I told her how turned on I was, and she just kept moving it out of the way angrily. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, my fucking God, was that great.  But then she wouldn't jerk me.  See, I would never get it, because they always thought I was a cop coming in there.  For some reason, they think I was like a cop.  Put your voice into your look.  Yeah, so they're like, ah, you know, even if it was a shady place, which I just went in  for a regular massage, they'd always think I was a cop, so nothing ever would go down.  They wouldn't even come close to me.  Yeah.  I love a good handjob.  Yeah.  It's underrated.  Nothing like it.  Good, slow fucking handjob, man.  Oh.  Yeah.  The worst of the week, Countdown.

Rolling right along with the Worst of the Week Countdown,  highlighting everything good that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony Show.  I am Sam Roberts, and I am here to present to you the great moments from this week's Opie and Anthony Show.  Still to come, Piers Morgan in studio, William Shatner in studio,  E-Rock and his cell phone number getting given out on the air, that gets paid off.  Mike Buschetti in studio, a surprise appearance by Avril Lavigne, but right now it's Jocktober time. 
[00:46:00]  Of course, in October, every day, Opie and Anthony celebrate with Jocktober,  a celebration of everything horrible that happens in radio.  We pick a radio show from across the country, or Canada, that is terrible, and we mock them mercilessly.  We point out everything they're doing wrong and how typical it is for radio and a specialty.  This is, I think, the fifth or sixth year of Jocktober, and the Bee Morning Coffee Club never disappoints. 
[00:46:30]  Terry Clifford and the Bee Morning Coffee Club, people have been waiting for it,  got featured this week on Jocktober, and here it is on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Bye, bye, bye.  Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.  Number six.  Sam handed the disc and he said, do not turn it over.  Don't turn it over yet.  I want you to do the thing where you ask, like, where are we going, blah, blah, blah.  And then you can turn it over. 
[00:47:00]  We did that part already.  No, but I didn't tell you where we were going.  Okay, where are we going?  Where are we going?  Turn it over.  Rochester, New York!  Oh, good.  I think I'll be there next week.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Oh, yes.  Are we revisiting?  Oh, yes.  I think you have perfect timing on this one because I think my pal's on vacation.  Okay, good.  I think, if I read his tweet correctly the other day, I think he's away this week.  I'm hoping.  It's the middle of the month.  Brother Wheeze hates that we do this. 
[00:47:30]  I have to just stress that because he has to live in Rochester.  He's the big fish in Rochester, and he hates that we go after.  It's Terry Clifford Day.  It's the middle of the month.  We missed a day.  I figure, why not?  Oh, no.  Terry Clifford at the Bee Morning Coffee Club.  Bee Morning Coffee Club.  She's a nice lady.  Terry Clifford.  Oh, God.  Who is she with?  Wheeze says she's a nice lady.  That's great.  Terry Clifford is the star in the main attraction, along with Steve, who's just kind of the anchor. 
[00:48:00]  Steve Hausman?  Yes.  He used to work with Wheeze.  He's not a bad guy, by the way.  Oh, my God.  Listen.  A lot of nice guys up there.  This is some fucking lineup for Jocktober.  Some windup.  Hey, no, she's nice.  Oh, he's a good person.  Yeah, she's fine.  Can't say that.  He's got to be last time I was up there.  Oh, no.  He kind of begged me.  He goes, can you please?  Bro, she's nice.  He's like, ah, bro.  There's so many shows you go after.  Is it true that phase one is all ready? 
[00:48:30]  Um, I'm walking in now.  I think they're prepared for this.  They've been waiting for this guy.  I think.  Well, somebody deactivated her personal Facebook.  Immediately.  Hold on.  It's like emergency procedures in place.  The show is mainly Terry Clifford and Jeremy, who's the younger, kind of outrageous guy.  Look out.  And it's sort of Terry Clifford trying to, you know.  Reign him in?  Maybe a little.  Oh, Jeremy. 
[00:49:00]  I don't think she's officially a hole, though.  You don't think so?  No.  No.  Maybe we'll let Jack over me.  She fucking clogs them.  Yes.  Let's say hi to Nick in Tennessee.  Nick.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Hey, um, NASA actually just released a photo of one of their launches.  And if you zoom in, like, where all the fucking flames and stuff are, you can actually see a little frog.  Oh, we didn't talk about this on the show.  That's true.  Oh, yeah, I did see that.  That was pretty fucked up.  Yeah, I didn't see the movie, but you were talking about frogs.  I figured out. 
[00:49:30]  Oh, okay.  There's something going on with the frog in Gravity.  I'm not going to let that one go.  Thank you, Nick.  Thank you.  Because they chose not to have a lot of fucking, you know, people in this movie.  No.  And then they have a frog?  What the fuck?  All right, we're going to Rochester's new country.  It's not new anymore.  I think the Facebook may be closed already.  Why?  Yeah, it's gone.  Wow.  All right, then we don't do it today.  Mission accomplished.  They must have, like, just been ready.  Do you understand what I'm saying? 
[00:50:00]  I go to Rochester a couple times a year.  It's a problem.  Oh, boy.  Wheeze is begging.  He goes in the same circles as these people.  He gets squeezed out of the same circles by her?  He's begging.  Apparently someone's saying, not true, and puts up a link to the Facebook page for the  Be Morning Coffee Club.  All right, well, let's hear it.  Maybe there's some good stuff by her.  Be Morning Coffee Club.  All right, maybe they've changed their tune since last year.  There's a Facebook for the Be Morning Coffee Club.  Be Morning Coffee Club. 
[00:50:30]  Let's see.  All right.  Right now, they're scrambling.  Yeah, still, that's cute.  Just scrambling.  Is that it, Sam?  Uh, he's, he's checking.  Sam is, um...  Who is this?  Mm-hmm.  Who's out there?  Look at the Kenny wannabe.  That's a young, um...  Hey.  Short version of Kenny out there.  All right, are we doing this or what? 
[00:51:00]  Um, we found something.  Not only are we ignoring we's, you made sure it was all Terry Clifford clips.  It has to be.  She's the highlight of the show.  She's the best.  Hey, it's there.  Okay, yes, the...  Oh, no.  It's Jesus Falcone.  He died for your radio series.  All right.  Uncle Paul.  But their last post was from 2012, October.  So this will...  Yeah, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Oh, boy.  I bet you they put that up as a...  I don't know.  Fucking guys.  Holy shit.  What's the same?  The Siamese twin one double.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Look at little Jean Benet.  Oh, my God.  That's hilarious.  Yeah, yeah.  They're actually putting photos of Terry Clifford. 
[00:52:00]  That's hilarious.  All right.  It's a phone shoved up a guy's hand.  Oh, that's just so much.  Oh, that's great.  All right, here we go.  Today's Jack Taubber, Rochester's New Country, WBEE.  The Bee Morning Coffee Club with Terry Clifford.  There's two other guys on there, too.  Oh, whatever.  One of those guys is Jeremy, and Jeremy cuts off Terry Clifford with a sweeper.  Uh-oh.  Do you think Terry will sound like a hole here? 
[00:52:30]  Oh, I bet.  Rochester's New Country, 92.5.  Oh, Jeremy.  Jeremy.  That's me.  Oh, Jeremy.  That's me.  Oh.  She, uh...  How's she looking these days?  Terry Clifford.  By the way...  She's very fat.  I believe...  Mm-hmm.  And this is just me...  Uh-huh.  I think that this...  Is a dummy page?  A fake page?  Is a fake page probably created by Jocktober people last year that is now getting Jocktobered 
[00:53:00]  again this year.  Oh, really?  Yep.  I bet...  Or it's a fucking diversionary page they leave up there.  But it says in parentheses, no bad language or inappropriate photographs, please.  Hmm.  Which is not something you'd actually put in there.  And then it says, the first post from a year ago, hope our fans start posting some nice  messages soon.  Huh.  I think that the Jocktober folks started this page last year. 
[00:53:30]  They're attacking their own page.  Their own shit.  They've become self-aware.  Yes.  Wow.  How's Terry Clifford looking, you ask?  I can't tell if...  Like, I wouldn't be able to tell if her voice was sexy or not, if you didn't know what she  looked like.  Right.  Like, I'm listening, because a lot of female jocks, they portray themselves as sexy on the  air.  All you have to go by is the voice, for the most part.  Sure. 
[00:54:00]  Uh, especially in the old days.  Sure.  You know?  Um, and I can't separate her image that she looks like fucking Chubsy Ubsy from the little  rascals from, uh, the voice to try to imagine.  I'm going to really try next time, next time you play to see if I would listen to this and  be like, oh, she has a sexy voice.  Well, why don't we...  Oh, Jesus Christ.  She honestly does look like Chubsy Ubsy. 
[00:54:30]  Oh.  Oh.  She's a handsome woman.  Oh, Miss Crabtree, I have something heavy on my heart.  Weezy doesn't want us to do this?  No.  I think I'm safe as long as I mention that on the show.  Oh, of course.  Yeah.  I got some roots up there.  It's...  I'm just waiting for the day I run into this monster.  So does she, and they fucking push the sidewalk up.  Uh, the gang talks about Happy Meals, adding books instead of toys.  Oh, this should be a good clip.  Oh, that's nice.  McDonald's, they want to do that. 
[00:55:00]  At least the kids in my family, oh my God, they're going to be so excited to hear that  news.  Never mind.  I think it's a great thing, and I think it's a long time coming.  I can't believe they didn't do this a while ago.  Of course you do.  No.  If I'm a kid...  If I'm a kid...  She, first of all, I just tried to separate the voice from the image.  How'd it go?  She sounds fat.  I mean, there's just something in the...  She sounds fat.  There's just something in that resonance in the vlog. 
[00:55:30]  You don't like her Muppet hairdo?  That mushroom hairdo she's got on.  It's fucking terrible.  It's a Susan Waldman wig.  Oh my God.  Why would you cut your bangs straight across like that?  And she's got like a chip thing going on, too.  There's a certain chip aspect to her voice.  I kind of like her.  Do you?  Yeah, I think she's kind of nice.  She's a nice lady.  That hairdo.  That sensible hairdo she has. 
[00:56:00]  Today's October is WBE, Rochester's New Country, featuring the great, I say the great Terry  Clifford.  Yeah, she is great.  At least the kids in my family, oh my God, they're going to be so excited.  I'm excited to hear that news.  Never mind.  I think it's a great thing, and I think it's a long time coming.  I can't believe they didn't do this a while ago.  Of course you do.  If I'm a kid, that's the whole bad deal with the Happy Meal is the toy.  I know.  I'm not going to finish my nuggets just so I can read. 
[00:56:30]  You know what I mean?  It's like, you better eat your nuggets or you can't have the toy.  You lose that leverage as a parent.  Bad move, McDonald's.  Bad move.  Here's our weekly peek at what's new to Red Stream or download.  Unbelievable.  What?  What's unbelievable?  It's unbelievable.  Unbelievable.  These things Jeremy says.  Terry Clifford has never heard anything like this before.  She's a delightful woman.  Oh, Jesus.  She reminds me of my mother. 
[00:57:00]  I bet.  She's very Ruben-esque.  Ruben-esque.  Delightful woman.  I bet her calves need some lotion.  Yes, they do.  She probably has...  My mother would get, like, dry, flaky calves and feet.  Chipper, my psoriasis needs lotion.  That voice is horrendous.  And then you couple just that fucking Jabba the Hutt, blah, blah, blah, blah, that she gets in there.  You put that with that fucking accent.  Anthony is fucking mean.  That Rochester accent on top of, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. 
[00:57:30]  So you're saying there's audible big, fat jowls?  Yes, big, fat jowls.  Sounds like she's got a fish caught in her pelican neck.  Steve Hausman, though, I give credit there.  Yeah.  He knew it was a bullshit story, and he wanted to move on with his shit.  Yes, he did.  And I think somewhere in there he was wishing he was still on with Brother Weez.  No problem with Steve Hausman.  No problem with Hausman.  And he wasn't going to play with that dumb story.  He knew there was nothing there. 
[00:58:00]  Terry starts talking about flags hanging in the Rochester area.  Jeremy gets her with a zinger.  Oh, I like a good zinger.  And with a picture of each of our, you know, our lake and our falls and our river right  next to it.  They're very pretty.  It's just the first one that caught my eye.  How would you know pretty?  Oh, gee.  Yeah.  Sorry, mean.  Oh.  That one, Weez, is going to have to talk to you about that little line. 
[00:58:30]  Bro, did you have to call her a pig, bro?  Oh, yeah.  He gave me a fucking talking to.  He never gives me a talking to.  They're very pretty.  It's just the first one that caught my eye said, city by the bay.  And I thought, what do we have this for?  Do we buy it on sale from San Francisco or something?  Um, I know you've only lived here, but I don't like this too cool for the room guy, either.  Every thing.  I know it's all about Terry Clifford, but what about that guy?  Um, every word he says. 
[00:59:00]  Ah, you know.  It's just like.  I don't know.  Yeah, I know you like flags, Terry.  Like he's trying way too hard to be, I'm too cool for this shit.  Fuff, fuff, fuff.  She's got a chipper thing going on.  Something like that.  She's marvelous.  Uh, you know.  What's up, Terry?  What's up, Terry?  What's up, Terry?  We buy it on sale from San Francisco or something?  Um, I know you've only lived here about 30 years, but, uh, Irondequoit, there's a bay there. 
[00:59:30]  I know, Weisenheimer.  But when somebody says, hey, we need it to be San Francisco.  Yeah.  But then, so anyway.  Weisenheimer.  Exactly.  Weisenheimer.  Get out.  This guy's good.  Weisenheimer, what year is this?  I thought Terry Clifford had the zinger there.  No, no, no.  Weisenheimer's good.  That's a zinger right there.  You missed, because she called him a Weisenheimer and he mumbled, shut up, pig.  I missed that part, too.  You know.  Hey, Terry.  Hey, you know. 
[01:00:00]  Hey, Chipper.  What's up?  Are they on Twitter?  Why would you ask?  Because I don't know why, I think it's just mean-spirited.  We should say at least something nice to them and say we're just kidding and having a good time.  Yeah.  Terry can't believe how far Jeremy has gone with one of his insults this time.  This time, Jeremy has gone too far.  Are you going to waste all that manpower and labor to hang them up and take them down in the same month?  When you could use that time to, I don't know, maybe pick up some trash around the same street you're hanging these flags on? 
[01:00:30]  You know, we all think we can do a better job.  We all do.  Yeah.  But I don't know.  It's always sexy.  I don't know.  And I shouldn't complain, because I did enjoy them, and I do enjoy them.  Alex White over here.  I'll debate that guy.  If Lovely Warren won't do it, set it up.  Call Channel 8.  We'll get in there, and I'll square off against old giant glasses.  Oh, Jeremy.  Oh, Jeremy.  Oh, Jeremy. 
[01:01:00]  God, that just sounds terrible.  I know.  Can you believe Jeremy said that?  He said he had big glasses.  Oh, Jeremy.  Oh, no.  This is a nice lady, guys.  You know how much she'd hate me if I called her retard wig on the air?  Fucking Lego person hair.  Oh, Jim.  Oh, now, Jim, that's not funny.  Yeah.  Oh.  Hey, moose in a cancer wig.  Jab.  Oh, you know, we're just going to our jab.  I don't like that accent.  It's so unsexy. 
[01:01:30]  That Rochester.  Oh, yeah.  We're just going to, you know, come in here and do a good jab.  Jab.  Jab.  Jeremy.  Jeremy.  I think we're going to say jab all day.  All right.  Well, Terry is blown away by what Jeremy said to his grandmother.  A hurricane couldn't blow her away.  The only thing left is she might have got knocked into the ocean like the Ferris wheel.

Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, highlighting everything awesome from this week's Opie and Anthony show.  Still to come, E-Rock and his cell phone number being given out on the air and the money he's owed.  All that gets paid off once and for all.  Mike Buschetti, very funny comedian, in studio.  Piers Morgan, in studio.  William Shatner, in studio. 
[01:07:00]  But first, a surprise guest.  Not a surprise for us, but a surprise for the guest.  Avril Lavigne and her husband Chad Kroger from Nickelback were out in the hallway.  And so we decided to insist that they come in.  This was a thrill for me because I've loved Avril Lavigne for some time now.  Just to see her in person made my heart go pitter-patter.  I swear to God, it was a life-changing experience.  Avril Lavigne, in studio, with Chad Kroger, as a surprise on the Worst of the Week Countdown. 
[01:07:30]  Number five.  What's that?  Avril Lavigne?  No way.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yeah, she's here.  Fuck.  Open the door.  All right.  Avril, take a picture.  Make sure to take one.  Yo, Avril!  Yo, Avril!  Yo, Avril Lavigne!  We're...  Oh, man!  What's up, Avril?  Hi.  Hi.  Oh, fuck.  She's doing some twerking.  That's all we get? 
[01:08:00]  She just puts her butt in the...  She put her hiney.  Whoa!  She's lifting up the front of her shirt.  We can officially say we've had Avril Lavigne on the show.  Very, uh...  She won't come in and say hi?  But she got a minute.  She's very busy.  She's very busy.  Just say hi.  Just say hi, Avril.  Hi.  Opie and Anthony show.  Hi.  How are you?  We just want to say hi.  Just as adorable in a person.  I'm, like, hanging out in the hallway, and you guys are, like, waving through the glass.  Avril.  Hi.  I know, right?  What do you got going on?  Today, I have... 
[01:08:30]  I'm releasing Let Me Go, which is a ballad.  It's my single.  It's a duet with Chad, my husband.  Yes.  Nice, yes.  Of course.  It's on iTunes today.  Is that who you were hugging outside?  Yeah.  I would hope.  He was patting your ass.  I would hope that's your husband.  Yes.  We should talk to Chad as well.  Did you not know that we were looking through the window?  No.  Like, someone's patting Avril Lavigne's ass.  I hope it's her husband.  How are you guys doing today?  Good, good.  We were hanging out.  We just saw you over there.  What's up, Chad?  Chad.  Yeah.  How you doing, man?  Good, man.  Good, good.  Congrats on the new song.  I hope it does well for you guys. 
[01:09:00]  Thank you.  Absolutely.  That's great.  What are you going into, Shade?  Shade 45?  Yeah.  Over there?  We're just kind of making the rounds.  We're not a lot of steel guests.  We're usually not allowed to steel guests.  That's a game.  She looks like you guys because she doesn't normally push her ass up against the glass.  That was very nice.  That was pretty good.  Oops.  We were hoping you were doing that for our benefit.  It was nice.  It could have been my ass up against the glass.  Yeah.  It's not quite as...  We saw your mitt right on her ass at first and was like, okay, something's going on over 
[01:09:30]  there.  That's why they were yelling there because I was ruining the view of your...  Yeah.  ...toldest context.  Well, that's cool.  Good luck with the single.  Cool.  Thank you.  Very cool.  We've got a few minutes.  Really?  Yeah.  Well, maybe she does it.  Oh, that's cool.  Are you actually live right now?  Are you touring?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, we are, man.  Yeah.  Are you touring?  Are you playing?  I'm going to start touring in February, but my new record is out November 5th.  It's on iTunes right now.  Yeah.  It's a pre-order.  It's self-titled.  I see a few pictures of you pop up on Twitter and stuff where you're playing somewhere. 
[01:10:00]  Yeah.  You seem like you're always busy.  Yeah.  Working hard, having fun, happy to be releasing new music.  The fans have been great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How long have you guys been married?  15 minutes.  Oh, good.  Good, good.  We got married July 1st.  Okay.  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  Newly one.  Nice and fresh.  Nice and fresh.  That was creepy.  What does that mean?  That is...  What a creep.  Nice and fresh. 
[01:10:30]  Will you guys do the kids thing or what?  Eventually.  Eventually?  All right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  All right.  I have my songs and my babies right now.  Exactly.  You know, I mean, you don't want to bang that up too much.  Come on.  Come on.  Nice way to phrase it.  Well, you know, babies can wreak some havoc.  So I've heard.  This is going well.  I just made everybody very uncomfortable.  Anyways, that was nice to hear you. 
[01:11:00]  Thank you.  Yeah, that's great.  I should probably ask to take a picture before this interview goes any farther.  Go take a picture.  Guys, thanks so much for popping in and saying hi.  Great to meet you.  Have an amazing day.  You too.  Thanks, Adam.  Thanks, Chad.  Absolutely.  Oh, take a picture, Jimmy.  Oh, all right.  I want a picture too.  Get away from me.  Not you.  Thanks so much.  Thanks, guys.  Bye.  Good luck.  There we go.  Oh, come on, Sam.  You're bothering.  Sam. 
[01:11:30]  Oh, Sam.  All right.  Take it easy.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Very cool.  That was nice.  She's nice.  Very cute.  Yeah.  Yeah.  She's like such a crush on her back in the day.  Did you, Sam?  Oh, my God.  Right?  How old is she?  She's, I think, right around.  She's 53 now.  Probably 30.  How is she?  I thought she was actually much younger.  That's the Nickelback dude, you know.  Huh?  Who is that?  That's the Nickelback dude.  Yeah.  What's the Nickelback?  What's the lead singer?  Yeah.  Chad Kroger. 
[01:12:00]  You didn't know that?  You're going to run out there and take a picture.  All right.  Look at Jimmy.  I got the camera.  They've sold a few records.  I know.  That's hilarious.  You didn't know that?  Jim's like, I didn't know.  You didn't know that was the Nickelback dude.  We've kind of taken our shots.  That's funny.  Yeah, I know.  We've kind of taken our shots.  But I think everybody has.  I think you're safe.  Yeah.  It's the Nickelback dude.  Jimmy's hilarious.  He's like, I'll take a picture.  I was wearing my hat for Levine.  You should have asked him.  Because he, yeah.  A lot of people make fun of Nickelbacks. 
[01:12:30]  A lot of records.  Give me a Nickelback song.  Give me a Nickelback.  What's the photograph?  By the way, do you know how good you guys could have just got me if he wasn't the singer  from Nickelback?  Oh, God.  That would have been great.  You just, because you blindly went out there.  I did.  You could have just humiliated me.  Oh.  Well, he looks different now.  He's got, you know, his hair cut short.  He's got some nice fucking quim.  What was the fucking shooting up in?  You don't want to bang that up.  You don't want to bang up Avril Lavigne's body.  You don't want to be that guy.  Nah.  That fucks that thing up.

That's what it is.  The Worst of the Week Countdown with me, Sam Roberts, still to come, highlighting the great  moments from this week's Opie and Anthony shows.  Comedian Mike Buschetti in studio.  E-Rock and his cell phone number getting paid off.  By that, I mean the cell phone number being given out on the air.  That whole saga got paid off. 
[01:18:00]  Piers Morgan in studio.  First, a legend back in studio.  Wild Bill Shatner.  Yes, William Shatner stopped by to promote his new album.  And talk about Star Trek.  Did he want to talk about Star Trek?  No, but Anthony was there, so he was going to insist that it happened.  William Shatner in studio from this week's Opie and Anthony show.  We got Mr. Shatner outside the studio.  Bill Shatner. 
[01:18:30]  Get him in here immediately.  Oh my God.  Welcome back to the show.  There you go.  Captain on the bridge.  How are you, everybody?  Captain on the bridge.  How nice to see everybody.  Mr. Shatner, hello.  Or Bill, as I like to call him.  Bill.  My good friend Bill Shatner.  What's going on, Bill?  Back on the Opie and Anthony show.  Wow, we were looking at your new album.  Yeah.  I like this. 
[01:19:00]  Oh, I hope you do.  Yes.  Yeah, it's out there.  It's progressive rock.  Yes.  It's a whole new area that I wrote the words.  Billy Sherwood wrote the music.  Yes.  He's done a genius job in interweaving music and words.  And then these great musicians who have done solo numbers on it.  How does this get started?  How do you find something like this, a project like this to do?  Well, the label says to me, would you like to do another album?  And I said, yeah.  And they said, what would you do? 
[01:19:30]  And I said, I just flashed on an impulse.  I guess something creative.  And I said, I'll write about a guy sitting on a beach in despair an hour before sunset.  And then the sun sets, and through the beauty of the night, he regains his joy of life.  That one line was merely the way I hooked songs together.  Now that you know, you might recognize it as a progression. 
[01:20:00]  But you wouldn't have to know that to listen to the album and hear the song.  So it's a story?  Well, for me it's a story, but not necessarily.  You know, the order of the songs.  I placed the order of the songs so that it made that kind of sense that the opening number,  where's it gone?  Give it back.  I'm missing something.  Give it back.  He lurches into a song of unhappiness. 
[01:20:30]  And then gradually he begins to find, and then he questions time.  Where does time go when time comes to an end?  And they're all melodic.  And it's all music.  But it's progressive rock, so it's pushing some sort of musical envelope.  Pushing the boundaries.  And what do you think?  Somebody maybe might be able to partake a little weed and listen to this.  I think weed would be nice.  Weed is always nice.  Maybe pop some mollies. 
[01:21:00]  Pop mollies.  Tequila.  Whatever name you're poison, as they say.  Do you indulge?  Do you smoke?  No.  I mean, you know.  No.  But once you take the opportunity to enjoy oneself, because you only come by once.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Look how well-dressed Bill is.  Well, look.  Bill always comes in here looking great.  Is that why?  I have to do, yeah.  So I thought I'd wear the black suit. 
[01:21:30]  It's slimming.  You've got like a Johnny Cash thing.  Yeah, right.  I'm doing my Johnny Cash thing.  Oh, wow.  That's very nice.  Yeah, I'm going to the prison.  You're going to Folsom Prison and sing a few songs.  All right.  You might as well.  About weed.  I have a question.  Yes.  Did you really turn down Richard Branson?  He offered you the flight to go up in the new craft, and you said no?  Well, he said to me, this is some, maybe even years ago, a couple of years.  But he said, I've got, I'm going up, would you like to go up in the airplane? 
[01:22:00]  I said, yeah.  It sounds like it.  He said, that's great.  It'll cost you $250,000.  Oh, he wanted you to pay.  Right.  So I said, oh, you want me to pay?  That's crazy.  I said, no, no.  I said, I'll go, and you pay me to earn it.  Yeah, of course.  Yeah.  That would help the business to have Shatner on that.  Of course it would.  I never heard from him again.  Good for you, Bill.  I was going to say Mr. Shatner.  Our sheet says that you didn't go because you were scared of airline travel.  Yeah, right. 
[01:22:30]  I'm taking, I'm a private pilot.  I have seven hours in a helicopter.  I'm learning to fly a helicopter.  And he's afraid of flying.  I think he's watching too much.  It's paramotoring.  I'm into paramotoring.  Paramotoring, wow.  So you strap a 75-pound engine on your back.  Run like hell.  You have to run.  You need a prevailing breeze because you've got to get to about 13 miles per hour to get flying speed.  And you've got a kite that you're holding onto. 
[01:23:00]  And you run like hell, usually on a beach because that's where the prevailing breeze is.  And you fly about 25 miles an hour.  And now you're up in the air with a kite.  That's crazy.  Wait, you actually do this?  Yeah.  I've done it many times.  How high do you go?  Well, you know, there have been some people who got caught in an updraft in a thunderstorm and died of hypothermia.  Hypothermia.  They may have gone as far as as high as 30,000 feet.  Oh, God.  Well, some of those hammerheads, a storm can get that high. 
[01:23:30]  Oh, yeah.  They'll just blast you right up.  They'll just blast you up.  Wow.  I fly gliders as well.  And this instructor took me up one time in a thunderstorm.  And we were angled, pointing straight down and going up.  And still going up.  Come on.  How scary is that?  That's scary.  Aren't gliders pretty scary in general?  No.  They seem like it.  Well, you have to stick around the landing field.  You have to land.  But you have a means of killing the flight by spoilers on the top of the wing. 
[01:24:00]  So you can stop flying whenever you want.  So if you come in for a landing and you're sort of like overshooting and you can't go back, you know, there isn't an engine.  You pull those flaps in, in effect.  And you lose lift.  And you lose lift almost right away.  Wow.  So the thunderstorms, how hot?  Like you're going at 100, 200 feet and then a thunderstorm can just suck you up.  Well, yeah, probably not that low.  But you may be, you get towed to 1,200, 1,500, a couple of thousand feet. 
[01:24:30]  You get towed up, you release, and then you play around in the thermals.  Thermals are columns of air that heat up like a plowed field will radiate heat more than a green field.  So now there's hot air rising.  And in that rising air, and you look for the rising air, either birds or clouds indicate there's rising air.  And you have an instrument on your panel that tells you that you're rising or falling. 
[01:25:00]  And so, and one time, a long time ago, one time when I was circling in a, in a thermal, a hawk got in the same thermal.  And we were circling each other, big red hawk at me.  And he was looking at me, and I was looking at him.  It was the most incredible moment.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.  Did you write a song about that?  Yeah, that sounds like a song.  That's a song.  I should have, huh?  Yeah, I think so.  I need to do another album.  Yes, but you can call it chasing the hawk, or is he chasing me? 
[01:25:30]  Oh, look at that.  Very profound, Jimmy.  So profound, Jimmy.  That is.  How big is the circle you're making in these?  Well, it depends on the size of the thermals.  Sometimes thermals can be quite large.  Sometimes they're 6, 10 feet across.  It just depends.  Wow, man.  Getting sucked up backwards, what did you finally do when you're getting sucked up?  How did you guys get down?  Well, you fly out of it, and then you descend.  And that's how gliders do distances there.  You can get a pin, I think it's 750 miles, or you can do 700, so you're rising, going 
[01:26:00]  a distance, find another thermal, rise, do another distance, and people fly forever  like that.  The limit is how long you can stay awake.  There is another type of flying, I've forgotten the term now, but when the wind blows, like  in Hawaii constantly, like the trade wind, and it hits a cliff and bounces up, it's like  water.  So you aim your glider into the rising air at an angle that is just enough to stop you  from going forward or backward, and you're continually in the air, because that wind is 
[01:26:30]  continuing.  Just kind of floating.  And you're just floating.  Wow.  And I think the limit is like 50-something.  It was when I was aware.  It was like two days, and then the guy just sitting in one place.  Sitting in one place.  He couldn't stay awake any longer.  That's amazing.  That's pretty cool.  And how long have you been a private pilot?  Oh, a long time.  A long time?  I was doing something, a theater thing in Miami in the Poinciana Playhouse in Palm Beach, and 
[01:27:00]  there's an airfield next door, and I had always wanted to take lessons, so during the day when  I wasn't working at night, I was taking lessons.  And so I soloed there and went on to fly in Santa Monica.  Wow.  I even got checked out in a biplane in a pit special.  It's an aerobatics plane. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, yeah.  I got checked out in an aerobatics plane.  Wow.  I did loops.  You did, yeah.  Cuban rolls.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, it was incredible.  You're quite the little daredevil there, aren't you?  I'm not afraid to fly, but I just didn't want to be charged that kind of money.  Yeah, 250 large to...  But I was in the desert, the Mojave Desert, when that airplane, that technology was being  tried out, and they got into space 100,000 feet. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They won a prize.  They won $10 million.  I've forgotten what the name of the competition was, but that design won $10 million, because  they were the first ones in space, using chopped up rubber and nitric gas, nitric oxide, I  think.  Instead of oxygen and nitrogen and all this as a fuel, they were using chopped up rubber  tires and a gas you can get in your dentist.  Yeah, like a solid rocket booster they had instead of liquid oxygen. 
[01:28:30]  Yeah, yeah, I guess anything mixed with enough oxygen will burn, so rubber seems to be a  good rocket fuel.  I guess it was...  What the technology is, I don't know, but they just blew it out the back end and...  Maybe if you had a few tires over there on the Enterprise, Scotty wouldn't have been up  Schitt's Creek so many times, you know?  You go, Scotty, Scotty, get me out of here.  Chop up my tires.  Chop up some tires.  I'm chopping tires as fast as I can, you know? 
[01:29:00]  Who would think such an archaic wave?  My God, Bill.  What's the height you've got to get to to be considered breaking the atmosphere?  I think it's 100,000 feet.  Oh, okay.  100,000 feet.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you watch the jump?  The Red Bull jump?  I did.  Oh, that's...  How insane was that?  Well, it wasn't insane, because he was very careful.  He knew what he was doing.  He knew what he was doing.  Well, just as a regular person, I see that as insane, is what I'm getting at, Bill.  It's insane only so far as you and I are concerned, but he knew what he was doing. 
[01:29:30]  He's a stuntman.  He calculated his chances, and look how famous he became.  Yeah.  As a means of making a living, as being famous for more than the 15 minutes.  Right.  When he opened that door and moved forward and got ready to jump.  My understanding is that he thought, what am I doing?  Yeah.  He's looking down, you know.  The one thing...  And he gets 800 miles an hour.  Yeah.  He broke sound, right?  He broke sound.  He broke gas.  Yeah. 
[01:30:00]  Sure he did.  When you look at that view when he opened the door, the thing that has to go through your  mind is, it looks like I can miss the planet.  Like, you could just...  Right.  If you jumped to the side a little too much...  Imagine if you jumped and just started floating.  Oh, God.  Oh, fuck.  What about those guys who wear those winged suits?  Yeah, the winged suits.  And fly through holes in the ground.  I've seen those guys.  And they fly next to mountains.  Well, next to mountains, but there's a guy who went through a hole.  I know what's one you're talking about.  Is it?  Really?  A couple weeks ago, he went through a hole. 
[01:30:30]  Six feet in diameter.  Yeah.  Come on.  Yeah.  It's an unbelievable window.  He's going hundreds of miles an hour.  Wow.  And he has to calculate.  He's got to get his body together.  And he went right through it.  He flipped through this thing, like a needle.  That's crazy.  Some running a needle.  Some little hole in a rock formation, yeah.  Do they jump off the cliff, or do they get out of an aircraft?  He jumped off a cliff in this case, I believe.  But they do jump out of aircraft.  I've seen those guys jump off the cliff, and then instead of going away from the cliff,  they go right next to it.  Right.  And they've got a helmet camera.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And it's an amazing view, but you think, wow, you could really screw up. 
[01:31:00]  You see the ones that are 10 feet off the ground?  And they've got their buddies filming them, and they go fucking doing a flyby over his head?  With the wings, right?  Yeah.  They're crazy.  Yeah, but they must know with their experience.  It surely must take a lot of strength to keep your arms spread out at 100 miles an hour.  Yeah, you would think that, right?  I mean, if you tried it in a car.  Yeah.  And then to have a web on your hands like that would really be pushing your arms back.  I think you'd have to be in pretty good shape.  And you know, if you close them, you plummet. 
[01:31:30]  I guess that's a motivator.  You're keeping me alive.  Oh, God.  Did you see Gravity, the movie?  No, I haven't seen it yet.  I hear it's wonderful.  I liked it a lot, and not so much.  I thought it was okay.  I thought the effects are amazing.  They've come so far with technology and how space looks and how they portray weightlessness  and whatnot in movies now.  So it amazes me how they do that.  Not that it was ever bad when you were up there, Mr. Shatner. 
[01:32:00]  You were moving from a cable.  From a cable.  And you could see the cable and see me turning slowly in the wind.  Well, I do remember once you were outside the ship, of course, and you were floating,  and you kept disappearing.  I think that was one with the Tholian web, I think.  Right.  It was the Tholian web.  And you were in that funny space suit.  It kind of didn't really look like a space suit.  It looked like carpet waffle padding.  The trouble we had was lighting the face.  How do you get light on the face? 
[01:32:30]  It's like a light bulb somewhere.  Turn the switch on.  You've got to see Shatner's face.  Turn on the light bulb.  Oh, yeah, and floating around there.  And I assumed it was by cables or sometimes maybe even I think your hands are just up  and you were on the floor doing this.  That's funny.  And then they just kind of cut your feet off in the shot.  I don't remember, but probably.  Maybe I don't remember.  I want to forget.  I don't think you could ever forget that. 
[01:33:00]  Oh, my God.  This, you know, just to come back for a second, this album is progressive rock.  And progressive rock, I've come to think of as a science fiction of music.  It's pushing the boundaries.  It's pushing, it's opening up areas that may not have been there before.  In this case, Billy Sherwood, who is a progressive rock genius.  Yeah, from Yes.  From Yes.  And, by the way, Tony Kaye and Scott Conner and Ricky Tierney form a group called Circa. 
[01:33:30]  And I am going to be doing the album with Circa in three venues in the Los Angeles area.  Canoga Park, the Canyon Club is one of them.  And 23rd, 24th, and 25th of this month of October, I'll be in the Los Angeles area performing this album with these wonderful musicians. 
[01:34:00]  And with the idea of seeing how good we are, whether we're good enough to go on and tour and maybe play places like Vegas.  That's amazing, yeah.  Oh, I would like to see that.  Absolutely.  I'm having such a journey with this album and this music video, which is on YouTube.  Shot the music video, you know, on a shoestring and then making the album and now performing the album in front of public. 
[01:34:30]  The public is a musical journey I've never been on before.  There is such a mystery in music to the people who haven't studied or aren't acquainted.  Like somebody was saying, finding one.  Do you know what that means?  No.  And here you are, you play records all the time.  And nor did I.  Well, one, two, three, four, two, two, three, four, right?  Uh-huh.  So you've got to find one.  The drummer has to find one.  And the bass guitarist has to find one. 
[01:35:00]  And that rhythm.  How do you know when to come in?  How do you know after a long solo do you come in?  That is true.  It's almost this instinctive thing you kind of feel.  No, it isn't.  Well, yeah, but what if you don't feel good that night?  Well, that's true.  You don't come in?  I think it's jazzed.  No, you've got to come in.  You've got to come in on.  The guy finishes, the guy, you've got to start.  How do you know when to start?  It's mysterious, I'm telling you.  You need all kinds of help.  So that mystery, not only that, not only the mystery of when to come in. 
[01:35:30]  You know, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.  That's right.  Right.  The needs of the one outweigh the needs of the four or the count of seven.  They even have, in this record, they have a count of seven.  What?  One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, one, two, three.  Wow, that's not even an even number.  That's exactly.  It's kind of odd.  Yeah, yeah.  So, this mystery of rhythm is one.  The other mystery for me is, I saw Yo-Yo Ma play his cello with the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
[01:36:00]  a couple of weeks ago.  Have you ever seen him?  No.  I had a friend, he hit his head once.  That's too highbrow for us.  And he couldn't say anything but Yo-Yo Ma.  He kept just blurting it out.  Yo-Yo Ma.  He got his head kicked by some guy.  That's your story?  Yeah.  And some guy kicked him in the head.  And he kept saying Yo-Yo Ma?  And he said Yo-Yo Ma.  I don't know why.  What is that?  I don't know.  It's some kind of a brain thing, I guess.  He wouldn't have said No Mas?  No, it was Yo-Yo Ma.  Weird.  Yo-Yo Ma. 
[01:36:30]  No.  No.  By the way, Yo-Yo Ma is a great cellist, right?  So, I watched him play, and the cello in his hand and the bow in his other hand, it was  like an extension, not only just his body, but of his soul.  He played the music.  He was alive in the music.  And the mystery of, in this case, the cello, the cat gut and a horse hair, and this gorgeous 
[01:37:00]  sound emerges.  We're the only animal that does that.  There are other animals that sing and make music with their voice, but who makes a tool  to make music, which, on the surface of it, should be screeching.  It just sounds like it would be ridiculous, right?  We'll take a horse hair.  Exactly.  Yeah, yeah.  And if you don't play it right, it is ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a little, my grandchild playing the violin, you know. 
[01:37:30]  My grandchild got violin lessons.  She'd never really heard a violin.  One day she heard the violin and said, oh, that's what it's supposed to sound like.  And it really is odd that you can teach someone, no matter how much they practice and how much  you teach them, they just can't be as good as somebody who has a natural talent for it.  So there's just this natural ability that can't be taught.  Is it a natural ability?  Is it somebody, is it a child who lets, or I guess an adult, who lets themselves be totally 
[01:38:00]  open to the experience so that they go with the experience rather than saying, ooh, I'm  not good, and get self-conscious and restricts themselves, no matter what the skill is.  Maybe that's it.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's more, it is kind of a difference between something mathematical and something  spiritual.  You know, is it something that could be looked at in an equation, or is it a more spiritual  flowing thing?  Exactly.  So that mystery of the music is the journey I'm on now, discovering I'm into the words, 
[01:38:30]  but Billy Sherwood composing the music and knitting music and words together.  It's like an undiscovered country.  Yeah.  It was the best of all those movies.  I liked that one.  I did.  I liked them all.  What do you listen to?  What do you listen to?  What kind of music?  Well, I'm probably a jazz enthusiast.  I like jazz.  Yeah.  And hates jazz. 
[01:39:00]  I don't like jazz.  I want to like jazz.  You can't hate jazz.  He hates it.  I don't hate it, but I can't.  No, no.  He hates it.  This guy hates it.  You can't hate jazz.  You can't.  I, um.  No.  No, you're not listening to music that pleases you.  Jazz takes so many forms.  You can't hate jazz.  Jazz could be the blues.  I mean, jazz.  Well, I know.  He doesn't like the blues either.  I, I, jazz to me.  You can't hate the blues.  He hates the blues.  He likes disco.  He loves guns, though.  I don't like disco.  It begins and ends with Donna Summer. 
[01:39:30]  No.  I don't like it when it sounds like everybody in the band is playing something completely  different.  It sounds very self-indulgent.  All right.  So, listen.  On one of the cuts, Al Demiola, the great jazz guitarist, is on my record.  Al Demiola is playing on my album, Ponder the Mystery.  He plays a lick on one of the songs.  It's fantastic.  Steve Vai.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah.  Playing guitar in the opening number makes me weep with the wrenching feeling of his electric 
[01:40:00]  guitar.  Which one is he on?  He's on the first one.  Where It's Gone?  Where It's Gone.  Is that the one we should play today?  Play that.  Play that.  It's a...  When we're done here, we're going to do that for you.  Okay.  Yeah, definitely.  You know, I was watching Columbo the other night.  Yeah.  And there was Dr. Janice Lester and Tupring, the Vulcan Bride, on the same episode.  That's impossible.  I mean, that's what I said.  I've never seen them together. 
[01:40:30]  I've never seen them together either, but there it was.  I'm like, this is like a Star Trek cavalcade I'm watching on Columbo.  You were in a Columbo, too.  I was in more than one.  I did more than one.  Yeah, yeah.  Those were great shows.  The only bad thing about it, you missed the first five minutes.  You might as well have not watched the show.  Now, the problem, the difficulty with that show, and the problem for writing for it,  was you, the audience, knew who did it.  Yes.  And you had to watch with fascination while the character in the movie...  Figures it out.  ...knows what you already know. 
[01:41:00]  Right.  And that was the difficulty in writing for it.  They pulled it off, though.  Oh, yeah.  It works.  It's a fun show to watch.  Great, great character.  And then you just see people from, you know, from old episodes of Bonanza and Star Trek.  Yeah, well, everybody wanted to do it.  It was an hour and a half.  It paid well.  Uh-huh.  You know, and it was well-written, so you wanted to be on that show.  Some really good directors, too, where you'd watch the credits and see, like, oh, my gosh,  Spielberg did that.  Yeah, yeah.  Really? 
[01:41:30]  Well, Spielberg started off at Universal doing Little Moon.  And they did Duel, that movie Duel with...  Duel.  Peter Matt...  It was McLeod, who played McLeod, that guy.  Yeah.  The guy with the limp.  The guy with the limp and the little...  Dennis Weaver.  Dennis Weaver.  Thank you, sir.  Yeah, yeah.  And he directed Duel.  Right.  And Peter Matheson wrote it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And these were all great names of people just starting their career. 
[01:42:00]  At the time, yeah.  That Night Gallery was another show.  Rod Serling's Night Gallery.  There was a lot of young, at the time, directors that were doing that.  I actually wanted to ask you about Rod Serling, because we kind of have a fascination with  him here.  What was he like to be around?  Well, I wish I could say that he was a mentor to everybody.  You know, as you were asking me, I thought, well, would I make up...  He was a child molester.  That would make up.  Yay! 
[01:42:30]  No, better not.  His widow will sue me.  You know, what you're asking is, I, as a young actor, just sort of beginning and knocking  on doors, what did I think of the producer who was up in the building and up in the offices  I never got to, but in this case, I had worked with him and a group of the people that he  took with him from live television to film when he was doing Twilight Zone. 
[01:43:00]  So I had worked with Rod in live television.  In the latter part of the live television days, I came from Canada, and I did Playhouse 90 and  all those hour shows that were famous at the time.  And he and a host of people whose names you would recognize from movies were there beginning  their career.  It's just like you're saying now about these early film stuff.  They were burgeoning. 
[01:43:30]  So I did get to know him a little bit.  A cool guy.  Short in stature.  Enormous talent.  Creative talent as a writer.  And he did mentor a lot of people.  How long did it take you to film that famous episode?  The Man on the Way episode?  They were all three, four, five days maybe.  Yeah, and being a pilot, you know, you'd know what that stupid little furry guy could do  being afraid of flying, according to Arliss. 
[01:44:00]  I don't know where those things come from, but it's insane.  It makes you think how all the stuff we want to believe, you know, so-and-so was sleeping  with so-and-so.  Oh, yeah.  It's, you know, so much of it's made up.  I don't know where they get it from.  Like afraid of flying.  I mean, I...  How would...  Yeah, if they do a little research, they could tell that you're a pilot.  Figure that one out.  Hey, did the little man...  Who was the little man in the costume on the wing?  Did you get to know him at all?  No, he's a Czechoslovakian, or was a Czechoslovakian acrobat. 
[01:44:30]  Oh, wow.  Yeah.  In a little furry suit that was ridiculous.  I mean, it was ridiculous.  Standing...  You know, you'd think they'd give him wings or some streamlining or something.  Yeah.  He was a little panda bear on the edge of a wing.  And when he flew off, yeah, he just kind of pulled him up and out of frame.  Exactly.  And like you were saying, our special effects were so bad, which tells you that the audience 
[01:45:00]  is willing to suspend disbelief on anything if the story is good enough.  Right, right.  The biggest thing, a problem I had with the episode was just tell the wife, who's so concerned  with her husband at the time, because he had this nervous breakdown, look, sit here and  look out the window the whole flight.  Just stay there.  Don't move.  There.  Problem solved.  Either she sees it, or it never shows up again and he's fine. 
[01:45:30]  Yeah, but she was so tired.  She had to sleep.  Oh, she had it with you.  She had to sleep.  She had narcolepsy, or something.  It really shows how far we've gone, because the sky marshal, or whatever he was, the cop  that was on board the plane, he's asleep with his gun just hanging out in the aisle.  And yet...  Iconic episode.  Right.  Why?  Yeah.  Why?  Why?  What is the answer to why?  I think the story hits home with a fear of flying, a fear of the unknown. 
[01:46:00]  It didn't matter that the effects weren't that good, or...  And a fear of not being heard, seeing something that's wrong, and saying it, and nobody believing  you were listening to you.  Oh, that's interesting.  Yeah.  You must have had a lot of that in your life.  I have it every day of my life, actually, continually.  I tell a woman, I'm perfect for you, and she just doesn't hear me.  My favorite scene in that whole episode is when the co-pilot, I guess, comes out, and  he's talking to you, and you say, there's a man out there, and he goes, we know. 
[01:46:30]  And he goes, and you go, oh, oh, you've seen it yet?  But, oh, okay.  Like, you're all thrilled that he finally saw it, and then you realize, oh, he's bullshitting  me.  I've never thought of that, but you're absolutely right.  I bet it's...  I told him that.  No, you didn't.  He said it was about a fear of hairy men on wings.  You're an idiot.  I don't know what you're talking about.  Oh, God.  Yeah, maybe seeing something that no one else sees, because Sterling had that weird, you 
[01:47:00]  know, because he was not being heard.  You know, how many children, that's got to be such a basic impulse.  You don't think about that, but children at a table, who say, I got, let me, and the  adults are all talking, and nobody's listening to them.  And that rage and frustration of not being heard has got to be something we carry with  us for the rest of our lives.  Yeah.  Well, look at that.  Yeah.  A little...  That's what I do.  I just analyze.  How about that?  Would you talk to the little Czechoslovakian guy?  I'm fascinated with that guy. 
[01:47:30]  You would talk to him at, like, craft services, or...  The primitiveness of the technology didn't occur to me that.  Yeah.  Looking at it now, I don't know why I didn't think, this is so idiotic, I'm embarrassed  to be in this.  That's how I feel every day here.  But then you just have to look around.  They're saying we've got to wrap up. 
[01:48:00]  Oh, God.  Bill, they're saying you've got to go.  You've got TV together.  Bill's very busy today.  I've got a day...  I'm promoting Ponder the Mysteries.  Yes, yes.  But this is really worth promoting.  It's a terrific album.  It's gotten great reviews, by the way.  Make a good Christmas gift, Bill?  A great Christmas gift.  Very good.  It's a meaningful album.  It means you really love the person you're giving it to.  Absolutely.  You look damn good on the cover there.  I know.  Pretty good, huh?  Yeah, there is a very regal kind of...  With the sun behind them, shining through them, basically. 
[01:48:30]  Captain look, or perhaps even the admiral.  Oh, was he mad that you were an admiral?  Boy, was Con pissed.  Sorry, Bill.  I love the damn show.  Well, Shatner's hanging out outside the studio.  With the Nickelback dude.  Man, I'll give away the Shatner thing.  Yeah?  Fuck it.  Giving away all sorts of shit on my Twitter these days.  Oh, man.  That's a horrible...  What the fuck?  It's Smudge.  Yo, Bill!  No, it's Smudge.  You cheesed out on the autograph!  No, it's just the way the... 
[01:49:00]  He did cheese out.  What happened?  He did.  He cheesed out.  He cheesed...  Yo, Bill!  Hey!  Bill Shatner is outside in the hallway sitting next to clubs.  Well, that's why I'm yelling.  I know.  Oh, my God.  He's been there the whole break.  You want me to go get him?  That's worse than...  Yeah.  It's just not a good...  The texture of the cover...  Hey, Bill!  It's not going to sign well.  Your autograph is smudging!  He's just staring at his leg.  He doesn't want to cut over this shit. 
[01:49:30]  Ignoring you like he ignores Anthony.  I really have shot...  Oh, when I...  That was a wonderful moment I had with Bill.  I went to the...  Of course, our studio here...  Our studio here has total glass walls.  He's done with us.  It's glass walls on the studio.  Double glass.  And I was knocking on it.  I was banging on it until I got Bill's attention  because he was outside the studio at the time.  It's very soundproof.  Very hard to...  And when he looked over,  I put my hand in the Vulcan Live Long and Prosper 
[01:50:00]  against the glass and slowly fell to the ground.  And Shatner started laughing  and just waved his hand at me.  That was hilarious.  You want to try to get...  I was trying to get a good...  Try to get...  Like, uh...  Maybe he didn't know what you were trying to do.  Rathacon...  Try it again.  ...moment, but, uh...  Definitely should try it again.  You want to film it?  Yeah, I'll film it.  Hold on.  All right, film it.  Really?  I'll try to...  All right, hold on.  I'll try to get it. 
[01:50:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Hold on, hold on.  All right.  Oh, you got to go over to it.  Oh, yeah, okay.  Is this mic on?  You got it?  Yeah, it's on.  All right.  Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  I have a great photo of Club Soda Kenny and William Shatner out there together.  I'm rolling.  Okay, I got...  I got...  I got to walk like this.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Is he paying attention?  No. 
[01:51:00]  Wait.  Now he's laughing again.  Okay, he's laughing at him.  I...  I...  Oh.  Shall be...  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to ruin Opie's video.  ...and always have been your friend.  Oh.  You were my friends.  You're supposed to come over here and cry.  Why aren't you crying?  You're supposed to sit here and cry.  Here you go, my son.  I'm a hanger on.  I'm a hanger on. 
[01:51:30]  You're like the blood out of me.  Oh, he's had enough of you.  Oh.  He says I'm a hanger on.  Oh, dude.  Embarrassment.  It is.  That's hilarious.  He says I'm a hanger on and I'm draining the light blood from him.  Oh, is he fed up with anything?  He gets to deal with that stuff at, like, San Diego Comic Con.  All the time.  Oh, that was so funny. 
[01:52:00]  And he comes in and wants a picture.  He wasn't crying at the glass like he was with Spock.  I sent all your photos, by the way.  Well, thank you.  Anthony asks for a photo and he says another one.  Yeah, he remembers.  He remembers.  I sent to Opie, too.  Like, all the photos over the years.  I'm the only one that didn't take a picture.  I just don't do it.  Oh.  Jimmy.  Self-control.  Self-control.  That's a good one.  You don't know.  And you're creeping in my Shatner.  Am I?  Yeah, you're creeping. 
[01:52:30]  Look at this.  You're creeping.  Oh, man.  Jimmy's always poking his...  I just wanted to get a, like, kind of just a picture with...  Of William Shatner.  Look at Kenny and Shatner.  Oh, God.  That could be the best picture of the day.  Jesus.  I got one.  Shatner and Kenny.  Yeah.  That is a good one.  Tweet that shit.  That's a great picture.  Yeah, I tweeted it.  Oh, it's funny.  That's, uh, whatever.  It's on my Twitter.  It is really weird that such an iconic figure...  You know, I wanted to ask him and I forgot to ask him. 
[01:53:00]  I'm wondering how many presidents has he met.  Ask him.  I'm going to guess seven.  Open the door.  Can you ask him how many presidents has he met?  We want to know.  Let's do a shout-in now.  I don't want to ask.  Open the door.  Open the door.  I'm sure he met Reagan.  Hey, Bill, how many presidents have you met?  How many presidents?  Yes.  How many presidents, yeah.  Uh, I met the president of, uh, the neighborhood, uh...  The president of the cleaning association and the Garbage Collector Association. 
[01:53:30]  I don't blame him.  He's done with us.  He's completely done with us.  But he's just sitting there.  We were told he's got to go and do other things.  It would be great if you walked out and just closed the curtain.  He would, yeah.  Yeah, he should get up and close the curtain so he can't even look at him anymore.  It's so strange. 
[01:54:00]  He's just sitting there.  I guess they're letting him just chill out until he does some TV and stuff.  The worst is yet to come.

Heading to the top of the Worst of the Week Countdown.  I am Sam Roberts.  You can hear my show, The Sam Roberts Show, here on this channel every Sunday at 4 p.m. Eastern.  This week, a big, big show.  Chloe Grace Moretz.  That's Hit Girl from Kick-Ass. 
[01:58:30]  She's on the Sam Roberts Show this week, 4 p.m. Eastern, Sunday afternoon on this here Opie and Anthony Channel.  But we are highlighting the great moments that happened on the Opie and Anthony Show this week.  Still to come on the Countdown today.  Iraq and his cell phone number being given out on the air.  The final payoff for that whole saga.  And Piers Morgan in studio.  First, Mike Bacchetti stopped by.  He was on the show once a couple years ago, I think.  But this appearance was where he really made an impact. 
[01:59:00]  Mike Bacchetti, we didn't know what to expect from him.  And he gave us something that will go down in Opie and Anthony folklore for some time.  He got to know DJ Who Kid.  Tell us about his time in the Marines.  It was fabulous.  Mike Bacchetti in studio here on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Number three.  Tom, I joined the Marines when I was young.  Oh, wow.  How do you join the Marines for a short period of time?  Well, it was a mutual agreement that I left, actually, you know. 
[01:59:30]  You never do that.  Bygones be bygones?  There's never a mutual agreement.  It was like, you know, they were like, well, you know, the minute I get off the bus, all hell broke loose.  Was it after the whole platoon hit you with the soap?  No, no, it was before that.  I got off the bus and all, this was like 1980.  What do you mean all hell broke loose?  A jelly donut!  Break it down.  What happened?  You had to run up to, like, Yellow Footprints.  And you would say, sir, yes, sir, right? 
[02:00:00]  And by mistake, well, first of all, when they get on the bus, the guy looked like all the army.  Uh-huh, sure.  And he goes, you're now propping the United States government.  You're now propping the United States Marine Corps.  You've got three seconds to get off this bus.  So guys are pushing, fighting to get off.  I'm like the last guy off the bus.  Oh, no.  Fuck, let me take my time.  You know, I'll get out there.  I'm ready to get out there.  You know what I mean, right?  So I get out there, and they say, when you hear your name, you'll say, sir, yes, sir.  So I went, yes, sir.  He goes, he looked at me, he goes, who's a dick sucker that got a cock caught down his throat and said, yes, sir, instead of sir, yes, sir. 
[02:00:30]  He goes, look at you, Liberace.  I go, Liberace.  I go, sir, he goes, your name is Milton Bradley from now on Sunday.  Some of the games played with you.  You're never going to want to come back.  Milton Bradley.  Oh, wow.  But when I met my drill instructor, he goes, I will turn you into Lee Harvey Oswald by the time of this.  Jesus Christ.  He had to make you more, like he had to put you on medication and make you more sane to make you awful upset.  It was crazy because like. 
[02:01:00]  So how long were you in?  I was in for six weeks, the first phase of training.  Then they decided to, you know.  How'd they break it to you?  The guy said, well, this isn't really working out for us.  Well, you really.  Wow.  Did he lose weight?  Were you?  No, I was in good shape.  You were in pretty good shape?  When I actually.  But what do you mean they said it didn't work out?  Like what did you do?  Well, you know, you're not actually right for this.  You know what I mean?  Because the Marines said it didn't ever say that.  Even if they just want some cannon fodder.  Were they mean here or no?  No, they were actually, by mistake one day. 
[02:01:30]  They must have went to the recruiter and just went, what the fuck are you thinking?  I haven't seen, you know, we didn't see women for a few weeks.  Because you're down there and then you.  I know you were horny as fuck.  Oh, yeah, I seen some woman Marines that looked like Vulcans from Star Trek.  Yeah, I didn't give a shit what they looked like.  I'm checking them out.  And everything you had to say was, sir, yes, sir, right?  Yeah, it is.  So that woman Marine comes over to me, right?  Uh-oh.  And I go to her, sir.  Cunt.  I call her, sir, right?  She goes, do I look like a sir to you?  I go, sir. 
[02:02:00]  So all of a sudden, my drill and sergeant stops the platoon, right?  He goes, uh-oh.  And my nickname was Space Cookie.  He called me, he goes, Space Cookie, I knew this had a feel.  He goes, what the hell?  You got to get that on a shirt, who, kid?  Space Cookie.  You got to get Space Cookie on a shirt.  He's coming out.  He goes, what did he do now?  He said he called me sir instead of ma'am.  So he looked at her and said, that mistake is understandable.  Oh, shit.  Wow.  But he was on my side for one.  Well, it was probably more fun for him to goof on the bitch than it was you at that point. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  Right there.  I was, when I got there, I'm like, I thought this was going to be John Wayne charging over the hill.  I'd get chicks, beat up bullies, and pick up the fucking back.  Oh, man.  It was more like John Wayne Gacy.  I thought I'd get hot chicks, like, beat up bullies and pick up the bitch.  Hot chicks.  You know, they're like Marines and stuff.  Didn't work out that way for you, huh?  No.  Oh, God.  Because when I got there, they were like, he gave us a speech.  It was, it's like, he said, my name is Sergeant Rivers.  I'll do the speech.  It was like, pile and full of no jackets.  Really get into it, too. 
[02:03:00]  He goes, my name is Sergeant Rivers.  You will refer to me as sir.  For the next 12 weeks, I will be your mom, dad, boyfriend, girlfriend, bisexual, pimpin' bitch.  He goes, my primary objective is to teach you to kill.  And I'm like, wait, that last part, my primary objective is to teach you to kill.  I didn't realize that was a job over there.  You know what I mean?  I thought.  Yeah, you're going to kill motherfuckers.  Yeah.  I thought, you know, I thought, hey, man, it'll be cool just wearing a uniform, beating up.  Guys are beating up on me.  You know what I mean, right?  I didn't realize it was like.  What did you think the Marine Corps did? 
[02:03:30]  That's like what they do is kill.  Kill motherfuckers, man.  I didn't realize it was that intense.  Oh, my God.  That intense.  The whole history of the Marines are killing people.  I was just screwing up.  That's how I got the name Space Cookie.  Joke yourself.  What did you do?  How did you get Space Cookie?  My accommodation lock, you know, to give you a lock, was messed up.  So it wasn't working right from the second I got it.  Oh, no.  An unlocked footlocker.  I'm in the squad bag trying to open it.  I'm still in my underwear.  Everybody else is squad chowhole eating. 
[02:04:00]  He came back for me.  And he just came out with the name because they're so good at improv and people and breaking balls.  He goes, Space Cookie.  He goes, you're ruining my Marine Corps, son.  You're ruining it.  He said that.  He grabbed my face and read as an apple.  He goes, next time I will kill you, bitch.  Wow.  And I'm like, and he meant it.  Really, really.  Damn.  Why was your fucking lock?  So you're in your underpants trying to unlock your locker?  I'm like fucking with it like this.  Everybody else is eating.  I'm like, damn this.  Why can't I open this?  I'm fucked with this lock.  I hope that he's not fucking looking for me now. 
[02:04:30]  Wow.  Did you get it open?  No.  Well, they actually gave me a couple of different punishments over there.  Oh, what were some of the punishments?  One day, by mistake, I said to a drill instructor, sir, good morning, sir.  It was early in the afternoon.  Is that crazy?  I go, sir, good morning.  He goes, does it look like a morning to you?  He goes, who do you belong to?  I go, sir, I'm in the 3rd Battalion, spilling my guts.  And he goes, I'm going to teach you a lesson from now on. 
[02:05:00]  He gave me like a plastic stopwatch he had.  He goes, you're going to be the official timekeeper of the 3rd Battalion.  I had him walk back and forth.  And he goes, and your name's going to be Big Ben, son.  You have a lot of names.  No, he goes.  Crazy AKA.  Yeah, yeah.  He had me in front of the thing.  I had to say, my name is Big Ben.  I'm the official timekeeper of the 3rd Battalion.  I screwed up and told Drill Instructor Smith it was morning, sir, the afternoon.  But in the meantime, he got some guy laughing at me.  Uh-oh.  And he made him, he said, after I got done with that, this guy had to say, and my name is Barabbas. 
[02:05:30]  I laughed at him.  That's what he made me say, so.  Br'er Rabbit?  Barabbas, you know, from the Crucifixion.  He made him say that.  Oh, okay.  It was a Br'er Rabbit person.  No, and then he called, so, I'm standing there walking back and forth, right?  But meanwhile, other platoons of drill instructors are coming over to me, and they're like,  he's an example of what not to do, you know what I mean, right?  Oh, Jesus.  Wow.  You know.  How'd you do as far as, like, marksmanship and stuff?  Good.  I still, I had a rifle and shotgun permit until, like, the mid-80s or late-80s. 
[02:06:00]  Uh-huh.  I didn't go to range.  Unfortunately, I, you know, got rid of all my weapons at home.  Why?  Is he considered a vet?  Yeah, are you a vet?  Are you a shot of an ass or anything?  I get some, you know, some, they tried to, you know, get me vet insurance to buy a house,  but I don't, I don't know.  How was your, what kind of discharge did you get?  I got an honorable.  Honorable after six weeks?  And all these memories.  It was awesome, because I, I learned, I learned that, you know, you're not an, you thought 
[02:06:30]  as a unit, not an individual.  I learned that pretty fast.  In six weeks.  That's crazy.  So what happened to all your weapons?  How come you got rid of them?  I had a, I just used to go to range a lot.  My mom was, I guess, you know, my mom was like, why do you need this many guns in the  house?  I'm like, well, you know, I like to go target shooting, really.  Yeah.  Not people shooting, you know?  Well, no.  That's the, you know.  Did you have a six pack when you were in army?  I was in good shape.  I was about 155 pounds.  155?  What do you know?  Oh, God, I'm an obese piece of fat crap.

We've all heard about fortunes being made owning franchises,  but have you heard about the ultimate way to make a franchise fortune?  It's called a master franchise.  With a master franchise, instead of paying franchise fees and royalties,  you receive them from all the franchises in your territory.  Royalties of about $15,000 to over $50,000 per franchise per year to the master franchise owner 
[02:10:30]  are common with 10 to 100 franchises in a territory.  As a master franchise, you don't have to deal with unit day-to-day operations.  You have low overhead, virtually no employees, and you don't need to leave your current job to do it.  A master franchise is the safest, quickest, and most profitable way to make your franchise fortune.  If you have a minimum of $50,000 to invest, call for free information about how to acquire and make a fortune owning a master franchise.  Call Master Franchise Investments at 800-437-5998.

[02:11:30]  It's the news of the day, but with a little heat.  Join me for The Kelly File, weeknights at 9, only on the Fox News Channel.  The worst of the week. Countdown continues.  Yep, yep, it's The Countdown, and I'm Sam Roberts, bringing you the great moments that happened this week on the Opie and Anthony show.  I promise you, the E-Rock saga, his cell phone number being given out on the air, the money Opie owes him, all that is getting paid off.  But you're going to have to wait a little longer, because right now, I want to play for you Piers Morgan in studio. 
[02:12:00]  So, Piers Morgan, strong advocate against guns here in America.  He's a British guy, so, you know, he sees what happens when there are no guns.  Not that many people get shot.  He comes to America.  A bunch of people are getting shot.  He says, let's get rid of the guns.  Believe it or not, Anthony disagrees with him on this.  Quite vehemently, as a matter of fact.  So, let's listen to their debate.  It's Piers Morgan in studio on the Worst of the Week Countdown.  If you look at Japan, Germany, Britain, Australia, you wouldn't find four countries which have a greater history of gun violence in the world than those four countries, right? 
[02:12:30]  Other than America.  The only one of all those countries which has never dealt with gun violence is America.  And, in fact, it's getting worse, because there are ever more guns in circulation.  They're ever more powerful.  They can kill ever more people in one go.  And here's why I say that.  The Sandy Hook shooting was the single worst single shooting of people in a school in American history. 
[02:13:00]  The Aurora movie theater massacre was the single highest volume of people, Americans, hit by one person in a civilian mass shooting in American history.  These things are getting worse and bigger and the scale more dramatic.  What will it take before eventually there can be a reasonable debate, and I mean reasonable, in America, about how you try and reduce mass shootings, gang violence, and general accidental death by gun?  They're different subjects. 
[02:13:30]  You can't just blame the hardware.  It all comes down to the gun.  No, it doesn't.  It does.  No, it doesn't.  Because in countries like Britain, Germany, Japan, and Australia, where they have basically removed guns, there is no gun crime and no gun death.  Britain, first of all, per capita, of course, we've got to look at the population difference.  It's a fifth of the size of America.  I understand.  But it has a much...  So what do you mean, per capita?  I'm saying per capita.  It has a higher violent crime rate than the United States.  Do you really believe that?  Yes, I do.  It's statistic...  Have you ever been to Britain?  No, I haven't.  But I know statistically... 
[02:14:00]  Do you believe Britain is a more violent country than America?  More violent crimes.  Assaults.  Assaults.  It's the problem with the debate in this country.  It's so ludicrous.  Of course it doesn't.  It's not ludicrous.  And the bottom line of the whole thing is...  I don't think you even believe that.  What are the stats?  You're both saying ludicrous.  What are the stats?  I don't have them off the top of my head.  Let me spell out for you about Britain.  It's in perspective.  It's not about me telling Americans I'd lead their lives.  Britain has appalling records on things like teenage knife crimes. 
[02:14:30]  Right?  Teenage obesity.  Underage pregnancies.  General yobbery and disrespect and stuff like that.  I feel very exercised about all those issues in my country.  But the one thing we got right, and which I think is particularly relevant to America,  is gun violence.  And I say to you guys again, I don't want to grab anybody's gun.  I don't want to take anybody's gun away.  I'm talking about going forward.  What type of guns do you think should come?  As they get ever more powerful and militarized,  at what point does reasonable restrictions mean you can't go to a Walmart in many cities in America 
[02:15:00]  where I can't buy a Kinder Surprise egg because the little toys inside the chocolate may choke me.  I can't buy six packets of Sudafed because I might be building some illegal pharmacy.  I can't buy French cheese because of the bacterial threat to my life.  But instead of those, I can buy an AR-15 assault rifle and then get on the Internet,  order 6,000 rounds of ammunition, and go and shoot up a school or movie theater.  At what point does America wake up and say, 
[02:15:30]  we have to be doing more to protect lives?  That's my only question.  We have to do more to weed out the people that are insane.  You don't even allow background checks.  The Senate refused to even pass background checks.  40% of all gun trades in America have no background check.  That means you can be mentally insane and or criminal and buy any gun you like.  Why would anyone be opposed to 100% universal background checks? 
[02:16:00]  I don't think a lot of people are opposed.  In New York here, I have to...  No, 90% of Americans supported it.  The Senate threw it out.  I have to go through background checks whenever I buy a weapon here in New York.  Why do you think gun crime in New York is plummeting to record lows?  Because the NYPD does a great job with the gangs around here,  which are a huge problem with gun violence.  But Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani and other mayors in this city took it on head on. 
[02:16:30]  And Chicago's problem is as much to do with not as good law enforcement as New York.  They're not enforcing the laws that are in place.  That's what I'm saying.  I agree with you.  Well, that's what I'm saying.  The laws that are in place should be taken care of.  Going after legal, law-abiding gun owners in this country is not the thing to do.  It's not going to help lower any crimes.  Of course it is.  No, it's not.  Let me give you an example of legal gun owners.  Adam Lanza's mother was a legal gun owner.  The most irresponsible woman with her guns. 
[02:17:00]  With legally owning a gun comes great responsibility.  That's the thing.  Education, training, things like that.  You know why she bought them?  You can't just...  You know why she had six weapons including an AR-15?  I hear she was some type of a survivalist and liked having a...  Doomsday prepper.  She was an NRA member and she just believed that actually the NRA were right.  If you arm yourself, you will protect yourself.  Unfortunately, she had a crazed son with an addiction to violent video games, a loner, a misfit. 
[02:17:30]  It may be of zero relevance or maybe it's not.  We don't actually know.  Some nut could look at a Monet and think, I've got to kill somebody now.  It's because they're crazy.  You can't look at the video game, at the hardware used, the gun, the this, the that.  Let's look at the actual problems.  What happened after Sandy Hook in terms of gun sales in America?  Well, they skyrocketed.  They're way up.  How do you feel about that?  Because people are afraid that their right to own these guns are going to be taken away. 
[02:18:00]  What about the right of those children not to be murdered?  Well, exactly.  Something has to be done about that.  What do you do though?  Because actually three things were proposed.  A new assault weapons ban, a ban on high capacity clips that were over 10 bullets, right?  And also universal background checks.  All three of those things.  Do you think that's going to eliminate school shootings?  I think it might help.  I don't think so.  All three of them got thrown out.  So the reaction from America to the worst school shooting in its history, unlike in Britain  where we banned all assault weapons and handguns, was zero. 
[02:18:30]  Not even background checks.  In fact, the fastest selling weapon in America in the four months after Sandy Hook was the exact  same AR-15 that Adam Landry used to blow those kids' brains out.  Because we knew it was being taken away from us.  But what an astonishing reaction from the great superpower of the world.  Why not?  Why wouldn't you, if you know they're going to be taken away and you want one, to protect  your life and your family's life and your house, as well as the police can, why wouldn't 
[02:19:00]  you want to get one before they're taken away?  Like they were in New York.  Like they were in this state.  You cannot buy one now because Cuomo decided...  This made New York a safer place.  No, it hasn't.  Yes, it has.  Assault weapons.  Look at the crime stats for assault weapons.  You can't even find them.  Look at the murder rates in New York.  What about it?  Look at the gun crime in New York.  Stop and fresh help with that too.  Stop and fresh help with that too.  Exactly.  Which is going away.  But to take the right of a New York American citizen, to take his right to own... 
[02:19:30]  To have an AR-15.  To have an AR-15, a weapon that is preferred to...  Oh, I say balls to that right.  The founding fathers...  You can't say balls to that right.  I just said it, and here's why.  The founding fathers never intended civilians to wander around the streets of America carrying  AR-15 killing machines.  Really?  How do you know what they meant?  Do you think they did?  I think they saw weaponry advance in their lifetime enough to know that it was going  to keep happening, and they didn't put a clause in there that said, and a musket was the 
[02:20:00]  cutting-edge weapon of the time.  How long did it take to reload a musket?  They didn't relegate...  Do you know how long?  It took a long time.  How long?  At least a minute, right?  Nah, somebody could do it pretty fast.  30 seconds.  30 seconds.  Imagine how many people you would kill in a movie theater if you had to reload per bullet  30 seconds.  But do you understand, they knew that technology was going to advance.  They didn't put anything in the Second Amendment that says, up until this point of technology. 
[02:20:30]  Are you aware of the history of how the Second Amendment was interpreted legally in this country?  Oh yes, believe me.  So you're aware that for 95% of its lifespan, the interpretation was not that an individual  had the right to bear arms, but that an individual had the right to bear arms as part of a well-regulated  militia.  It's...  And you're aware of how the NRA hijacked the meaning of that in the mid-70s.  Reagan became president.  He was an NRA supporter.  And as a result of that pressure, they began to pile on.  The Supreme Court eventually said, a few years ago, okay, it actually relates to individuals. 
[02:21:00]  It was hijacked by the NRA.  Who supports the NRA?  It wasn't hijacked by the NRA.  Well, it was.  If you know the history, it was.  No, because the history...  Who supports the NRA?  Who supports the NRA?  Who pays their money?  Legal gun owners?  No.  Yeah.  Well, partly a subscription.  Partly?  In their...  Who gives them the bulk...  In their membership.  Who gives them the bulk of their money to go after politicians who support gun safety?  The gay community.  I would guess lobby groups for...  No.  You're missing their number one funders. 
[02:21:30]  Who is it, Piers?  The gun manufacturers.  Oh, sure.  Why wouldn't they?  They're in business.  Exactly.  So when Wayne LePierre goes out after Sandy Hook and says, only every teacher had been armed.  They don't even want an AR-15.  Guess what happens?  They sell more guns.  You don't think other organizations get money from companies?  How do you feel about the NRA targeting politicians who support reasonable gun control?  It's never reasonable gun control, first of all.  If they're targeting a politician, it's unreasonable gun control.  So removing any type of assault weapon from civilian hands is not reasonable to you? 
[02:22:00]  I don't want that, no.  Really?  No.  I like the idea that I am able to have the same weapon that the police have...  But you don't, though, because they're allowed...  They're allowed fully automatic machine guns.  Absolutely.  So why are they allowed those and you don't care?  Again, there's a restriction on that.  But you're happy with that restriction?  No, I'm actually not.  You're just not happy with the other restrictions.  I would like to have a fully automatic weapon.  You'd like a fully automatic machine gun?  Yes, I would.  And you'd be comfortable with everybody else in America having one, too?  If they are trained and go through a background check, sure.  And mentally sane or criminal? 
[02:22:30]  That's kind of hard to...  How are you going to know if they are not having background checks?  Right.  Who is going to...  How are you going to know without background checks?  Well, I like background checks.  I said that.  You want universal background checks?  I'm for background checks.  I like them.  Yeah, I know.  I don't agree with everything the NRA does.  I'm not going to sit here and agree with everything.  Let's try and get to it.  This is a good debate.  Let's get to a point of consensus.  You would agree with universal background checks?  Yeah, I always said background checks are fine.  I like that.  What do you feel about the need to have magazines that have more than 10 bullets?  I like a 30-round mag. 
[02:23:00]  Why?  Well, again, the police don't go out with 10-round mags.  Why would you need one?  You know what?  For home protection, I like the idea of...  You think 10 people are going to come?  You're not going to hit everybody with it.  And it sounds ridiculous.  You go hunting?  You go hunting with, say, a 100-bullet magazine?  I'm not really a hunter.  Should hunters use 100-bullet magazines to shoot deer?  No, if you're going out hunting, it's a whole different thing than home protection.  That's not hunting, though, is it?  No, I'm not saying.  Why can't a simple handgun be used at home to protect a family?  As I've always said in America, with the volume of guns you have here, I've never been against that. 
[02:23:30]  It could be.  I'm known as this great gun-drabber from Britain.  I've always respected the rights of an American to have a simple handgun at home if they absolutely needed it.  But here's the other thing.  Wherever there are guns in homes in America, there is a higher rate of gun suicide of accidental gun crime.  Well, of course, because there's a gun in the home.  That's my point.  Well, I would say this, too.  If you go out in the ocean, you have a much better chance of being bitten by a shark than if you're on land.  It's one of those statements that, of course, if there's a gun in the house, there's going to be a better chance of somebody getting hurt with it accidentally or using it in a suicide. 
[02:24:00]  But many more crimes have been thwarted.  That's rarely ever reported.  Do you believe that, given that there are more and more guns being sold in America, do you believe that within 10 years, if you have another 100 million firearms in circulation, the gun murder rate will be up or down?  I think that has more to do with society than it does hardware.  What does your gut feeling tell you?  My gut feeling tells me, with all the pandering that goes on in this country, especially with the issues of gang violence, that if it keeps on track, the murder rate would go up. 
[02:24:30]  But it has nothing to do with the hardware.  It has nothing to do with the tool being used.  It has to do with a violent society.  On the same day as Sandy Hook in China, a lunatic went crazy with a knife in a school.  Right.  He stabbed 20 children.  Uh-huh.  You know the difference?  Yeah, like one kid died.  No, they all lived.  Oh, they all lived?  Yeah, I knew it was a much lower than...  So when you say you can't blame the gun or the hardware, actually you can, because in China, those guns are banned. 
[02:25:00]  You can't blame the gun for the lunacy that makes these people do these horrible acts.  Why wouldn't you, with every fiber of...  Are you a parent?  No.  Right.  Any parents here?  Okay.  I've got four kids.  Why wouldn't you?  How many kids have you got?  Two.  Right.  Why wouldn't you want to try and make it as difficult as possible for the Adam Lanzers, the slightly crazy people,  who, by the way, have not had direct treatment for mental health issues, so haven't been flagged up on the system. 
[02:25:30]  There were red flags on him.  There were red flags, but they weren't on paper.  He hadn't been into a mental institution.  That same point, can I just jump in?  That same point you're making, which is a valid point about why wouldn't you do this for your own children,  the press should take that attitude when it comes to doing things that are encouraging future shooters,  like covering it the way you guys do.  Yeah, but you're talking about chicken and the egg.  No, I'm not.  You can blame the press afterwards.  You can blame the violent video games afterwards.  I'm not trying to...  You guys are talking about guns.  I'm always saying the press has been reprehensible, and as passionately as you discuss violent video games, 
[02:26:00]  you should be talking about the press and the way they have pushed this forward.  My kids play some of these games, Grand Theft Auto and whatever, right?  I don't have an issue with violent video games if they are, as they are, hugely popular or whatever.  I have an issue where I see a pattern of these young...  At the moment in America, you have a pattern of young, white, mass shooters in their early 20s,  loners, misfits, who happen to be always playing a lot of violent video games.  A drop in the bucket compared to black gang members in the inner cities. 
[02:26:30]  I agree, but they are completely different issues to tackle, and they should be tackled in different ways.  No, because they're not completely different issues with gun grabbers.  Take your car again.  They want to take all the... lump them together as gun violence and take guns away from legal gunners.  No, here's what...  And by the way, you have kids and stuff, and you like them protected.  Do you have that armed security that goes around your neighborhood?  No.  What was that sign on your... supposedly on your front lawn?  It was a link to the Beverly Hills Police Department.  Oh, was it?  I presume you don't have a problem with the Beverly Hills Police Department being armed?  No, no, being armed. 
[02:27:00]  Nor do I.  That's fine.  Nor do I.  You've never been protected by an armed guard?  No.  Anywhere you've gone?  No.  Oh, good man.  The gun pro-rights people came to my house, and they photographed that sign, and they said  I had private armed security.  It was a link to the Beverly Hills Police Department.  Oh, it was.  I presume nobody here would disagree with my right to be protected by the police.  Well, that is your right.  Or indeed the military.  When it comes to the military, my brother is a British Army colonel.  My uncle was a British Army major.  My grandfather was a commando. 
[02:27:30]  I'm not a pacifist.  I understand the power of guns.  I personally believe that military weapons belong in the hands of the military or the police.  Well, yeah, but that's what's happening here in this country.  A semi-automatic weapon is not a military weapon.  It's an assault weapon.  You want the right to have a machine gun?  An AR-50.  You want the right to a machine gun?  Sure.  Which means if you have it, everybody else should have one, too.  No, I would love to be able to jump through whatever hoops it would take legally to obtain it.  And I know you can in some places. 
[02:28:00]  Vegas, for one, you could shoot.  Where do you think all the gangbangers get their guns in Chicago, where there's actually reasonably tough gun control?  A lot of them are stolen, and a lot of them are shipped in.  50% of all the guns that the police recovered in Chicago came from neighboring states.  Yeah, and the second you bring it over the state line, it's an illegal gun.  It becomes an illegal gun.  So we're supposed to take it away from the legal gun owners because criminals are taking them across the lines?  No one's not...  Wait a minute.  Like prohibition.  Let me ask you...  Like prohibition, Pierce.  No, you're being so facile.  It wouldn't work. 
[02:28:30]  I am not.  I'm saying that when they outlawed booze...  Not a single...  Booze poured into the country.  Let me ask you this.  Yeah.  Not a single person, me, President Obama, Michael Bloomberg, Senator Dianne Feinstein...  Naming all the good ones.  Not a single of the gun grabbers has ever actually asked for a single gun to be taken away.  Because they know it wouldn't work.  They've tried.  They would love it.  Wait a minute.  They would love to.  My point is you can't keep saying they're gun grabbing.  They're not taking anybody's gun, right?  I would love to have...  We are talking about the type of firearms... 
[02:29:00]  Let's go to the gun store and buy an AR-15 right now.  You can't.  They took them.  How many guns, if you took in every single one of President Obama's assault weapons ban  proposals, how many types of firearm in America would still be legally available?  Probably quite a few.  How many?  I don't know.  You're an American.  I'm British.  Come on.  How many in your country?  Why would I know if how many guns...  Why would you know more about gun rules in your country than me?  I don't know.  That's not a gun rule.  This is a weird stat that you know that I don't know.  To try to make it sound like I'm not educated.  How many guns would be left if you took all the assault weapons? 
[02:29:30]  It's a fucking math problem.  I don't know the numbers.  Let me ask you to try and hazard a guess at how many different types of gun, firearm,  would be legally available in America.  50 billion gazillion, Piers.  No, no.  Be serious.  I know the answer, but I'm not going to blow it.  Shut up.  Do you know?  I have no idea.  Have a guess.  Two.  No, a lot, I'm sure.  How many?  Have a guess.  5,000.  If you took all the what?  What's the question?  If you stripped out every single assault weapon that President Obama, under the plan 
[02:30:00]  that was put forward, wanted to remove from civilian circulation going forward.  Not confiscation, but from sale.  He's trying to get you to take something, and then it's going to be this huge number  that so many guns are still going to be available, even if you take the assault weapon.  Well, so what?  Well, what is the percentage?  So what?  Have a guess.  How many are available now?  About 2,400, I think it is.  Okay, so I'm going to guess 2,200.  It's about that, yeah.  I want to...  Yeah, you're basically talking 2 or 300 types of gun will be removed from future purchase, 
[02:30:30]  and these would be assault weapons.  Why can't I purchase a semi-automatic weapon with a 10-round magazine?  Because you want a machine gun, don't you?  You've already said that.  Well, I want one.  I can't have one.  I want a rocket ship, too.  I can't have one.  Because there are reasonable restrictions.  Yeah.  And there are reasonable.  Have you fired an AR-15?  Taking...  Sure.  Yeah?  I own four of them.  What is the difference between...  You don't want to know how many guns he actually owns.  I don't mind if you have guns.  He has a lot of guns.  Well, he drinks heavily as well.  And he kicks kittens. 
[02:31:00]  Yeah.  No, I love my kitten.  Bad person.  I love my kitten.  Can I ask Pierce something?  Sure.  As quote an outsider, what do you think America's obsession is with guns?  I think it's very cultural.  I mean, you look at someone like Canada, which has a very high volume of guns, but has nothing  like your gun crime rate.  There's something about the culture of gun violence in America.  But what is it?  I think it's a combination of things.  I think it's the cultural battles with my own homeland in the 18th century, where you  had to fight off enemy territory with guns, and that was successfully achieved. 
[02:31:30]  I then think you had your own civil war, which obviously had a huge amount of gun violence.  And I think as a result of that, guns became part of a family home, in many cases.  And people believe that their Second Amendment rights give them the right to continue to basically  arm themselves to the teeth if they want to.  Now, my argument is that at some point, there's got to be a better application of reasonable 
[02:32:00]  restrictions.  I repeat, I'm not going to take anybody's gun away.  It's not about confiscation.  Nor do I think when you have 300 million guns in circulation, you can't expect a family  that wants a firearm, a handgun, to defend their family from having one.  I respect that.  That is what I think would be what the founding fathers intended when they wrote originally  about this.  But let's face facts.  The Second Amendment's already an amendment, right?  The original Constitution wasn't perfect.  That's why there were so many amendments.  To me, it is so vague, the wording of the Second Amendment, and can be so interpreted in 
[02:32:30]  different ways.  Only if you want to twist it around.  Either way.  Either way.  You can either believe, as I believe.  It was written simply.  It was written simply.  As I see it.  If it was so simple, why was the interpretation until the mid-80s of this recent century, why  for 170-odd years was it interpreted to mean an individual's right to bear arms as part  of a well-regulated militia? 
[02:33:00]  Because people weren't trying to take guns from people up until pretty recently.  What is a well-regulated militia, though?  What is it?  A well-regulated militia is...  Here's what it is.  And especially back when it was written.  If you have your townspeople, people in your town, you want them to be armed so that if  they have to rally up a militia to fight some type of...  Right, but they were a trained, private, local militia, right? 
[02:33:30]  No, they were the townspeople.  Right.  They were the butcher, the baker, and the candlestick maker.  Right, but they are trained to use the firearms.  They work as a militia.  They work as a militia.  Right.  They're not individuals, right?  The militia of that day was just the people in town and their weapons being called together.  Now that it's become an individual militia of individuals living in their homes with individual  firearms, who's regulating them?  It would be the militia itself.  Who?  There is no militia regulating you, right?  No. 
[02:34:00]  You've got nobody regulating your use of firearms.  No, because we haven't rallied a militia together yet.  Right.  There's no need for one yet.  So if you believe that the Founding Fathers intended you to have a gun as part of a well-regulated  militia, I ask you again, where is that militia and where are they regulating it?  There isn't one now.  Right.  The amendment says that the right to bear arms shall not be infringed so that if we need  to put together a militia, we already have the weaponry. 
[02:34:30]  That's how the amendment is interpreted.  But that's not how it was interpreted for 170 years.  It says a well-regulated militia.  No, the problem with it is.  Being necessary for a free state.  This is where you're wrong.  The right to bear arms shall not be infringed.  Right.  It means.  But there is a comma in the middle of a sentence, which means you can take it either way.  And the Supreme Court in 2008 or 2009 decided that it actually didn't mean, what did it  been interpreted to mean for 170 years?  It actually meant an individual's right to bear arms no longer as part of a well-regulated 
[02:35:00]  militia.  But whatever it is, it's a hugely important point.  If you believe, as I do, that the NRA hijacked the meaning of the Second Amendment to sell  guns, then you've got to debate whether the interpretation of the Supreme Court affirmed  in the late 2000s.  Why would you think the Founding Fathers, knowing that there is an army, there's a standing  U.S. army, why would they say, well, you have to be in a militia in order to have weapons?  Because America, as you know, is a very big country.  Yeah.  So the idea of the Standing Army being able to get to some of the outplaces of America 
[02:35:30]  within weeks would have been unthinkable.  You don't think the Founding Fathers...  Now, we can drop a bomb or a drone anywhere in America in a matter of minutes, right?  So the need to have a local militia to take on the British if we reinvade has gone.  You also have, let me remind you, 5,000 nuclear warheads as a military firepower.  America has half the world's military firepower at its disposal.  Right.  You don't have to worry about the British coming. 
[02:36:00]  You haven't got to worry about anybody coming.  And you've got to worry even less about tyranny from your own government.  Oh, really?  Let me explain to you, if they do come for you, your government, they've got 5,000 nukes.  They're going to win.  We understand.  A few AR-15s is not going to succeed.  It's not about winning or...  So the tenets of the argument are ridiculous.  No, it's not.  Because it's not about winning or losing.  It's about a government having to kill its own people because they're armed with AR-15s  instead of having nothing...  You're missing my point.  No, you're missing my point.  No.  Having no weaponry and just doing it with a swipe of a pen. 
[02:36:30]  If they decided to do that, how are you going to defend themselves against nukes?  You don't.  If the United States has to start nuking its own people, I think it's over, Peter.  I'm assuming...  I think the country's done.  I'm assuming that...  If that gets to that point...  Well, I would say it's fairly done if they turn tyrannical.  So it's a question of how they execute the tyranny.  But if they have to take a single American life based on the fact that they want a tyrannical  leadership over Americans, then they have to fight people with AR-15s, as opposed to just  writing something with a pen and not having any resistance whatsoever. 
[02:37:00]  It would use all the firepower it had, which is nuclear weapons.  Like I said, and then the government's over.  It's done.  I just have to go.  We're not trying to interrupt.  No, no.  It's for CNN.  Your people are freaking out.  It's for CNN.  They're saying you have to go.  I've got that.  But let me decide.  I think this is a good debate.  I wish this debate happened more often.  I like the debate.  I think it's a good, important debate.  I'm not trying to patronize people.  I'm not trying to tell you how to lead your lives.  I just want, in the end, to see less, fewer Americans get hit by gunfire and die from 
[02:37:30]  gunfire.  I suspect we all agree with that.  What we're debating is how you best achieve it.  Exactly.  Piers' book is called Shooting Straight.  We didn't plug this properly.  Guns, Gays, God, and George Clooney.  We didn't even get to talk about the gays.  I know.  I would love to, or at least demonstrate.  And Piers looks very fucking handsome on the cover.  And I enjoyed this very much.  I really liked this a lot.  I agree with a lot of what you said.  Bravo to both participants.  Bravo.  That was a good debate.  And you get a lot of Twitter haters, man.  I love trolls. 
[02:38:00]  You love them?  Well, especially when they are bad spellers.  I like to correct them.  Yeah.  You know, they say you're a moron, and they spell it wrong, and it's like, great.  Oh, the your thing is very...  Well, they forget to put the hyphen between more and on.  Exactly.  You stay in the CNN?  Yeah.  We've heard the rumors.  Yeah, I'm contracted to CNN until next September, which will take me up to four years,  and I'm going to start talking to them in the next few months about the future.  I love CNN.  To me, it's one of the great news brands of the world.  I, as you read the book, it's in diary format. 
[02:38:30]  I've been at the center of some of the biggest news stories in history, whether it's, you  know, the mass shootings that you've had, the death of Osama Bin Laden, the Japanese  earthquake, the Arab Spring uprisings.  It's a thrilling place to be when big news breaks.  And I've also had the great honor of interviewing some of the most important people in the world,  whether it's, you know, the Iranian president, Ahmadinejad, or Prime Minister Netanyahu, or  the Dalai Lama, whoever it may be, Bill Clinton.  You feel like at CNN, you're at the center of all the big stuff, and that's where I've  always liked to be.  All right, Piers.  All right, Piers.  Come back and see us.  Anytime, guys. 
[02:39:00]  I'm actually going to read this.  I've enjoyed it.  Important debate.  Well, what happened?  You don't want him back?  No.  You gave me a look like what?  You invited him back?  Thanks, Piers.  Guys, I appreciate the time.  All right, right on.  Thank you very much.  Piers Morgan, everyone.  The Worst of the Week Countdown continues.  You have gone and done it.  You reached it.  The top of the Worst of the Week Countdown.  Give yourself a pat on the back.  My name is Sam Roberts, and if you've missed any of this, it is, of course, replaying, and  I'm sure it'll be available on demand at SiriusXM.com and all that good stuff.  You're going to want to hear every last bit of it. 
[02:39:30]  Right now, we're going to listen to the number one bit of the week.  E-Rock's cell phone number was given out on the air a few weeks ago.  He was on vacation, and Opie accidentally gave out his cell phone number on the air.  Ended up in E-Rock getting a new cell phone.  Opie promising to pay for his vacation.  Well, we were teased last week when E-Rock was supposed to reveal how much Opie owed him  for the vacation, and we were cut off. 
[02:40:00]  Or Opie decided to end the show.  I don't know exactly what it was, but the payoff is finally here.  E-Rock, does he get his payment from Opie?  And how?  It's all very important.  Let's find out here on The Countdown.  Number one.  Well, we've got to pay E-Rock.  We've got to pay E-Rock.  Is it time to pay E-Rock?  Eric.  Oh. 
[02:40:30]  Yep.  This pains me today.  This fucking pains me.  I hate being...  I remember how much you hated giving me like $100 because you lost some iPhone bet.  Yeah.  I can't imagine this.  I don't like being...  Oh.  Like Fonzie.  You can't say wrong.  Right.  I was waiting for you.  I get it.  I can't be...  So most people know by now I fucked up really, really badly. 
[02:41:00]  Still wish I would get just a little apology.  Because you really thought I did it on purpose.  And you're lucky enough to hang out with me when I'm not doing radio.  Lucky...  Dr. Who's shirt?  Kind of cool.  I like the British flag thing.  Thank you.  That's a good one.  How about a teeny apology? 
[02:41:30]  No.  Why are you looking at me like a fucking bull ready to charge?  It was supposed to be a good day.  Bull ready to charge.  It's been in so many ads I've seen.  So what happened for the people?  Because there are people that don't know.  Believe it or not.  You were on vacation enjoying yourself.  Yes.  And we wanted to play a bit we couldn't find.  So I called you. 
[02:42:00]  And it went right to voicemail.  And then I wasn't paying attention.  And this is the God's honest truth.  And as I was trying to think of something witty to say on your phone, your number went out because you never put a message on your outgoing message thing.  Your fault.  Did you see the way he just explained that?  Because shut up, Sam.  And well, then all hell broke loose. 
[02:42:30]  And you almost quit, right?  I was really tempted and I was so pissed off because this happens every time.  Not that incident, but something happens every time I'm not here.  Yeah.  So the Obster volunteered generously.  Yes.  I'm taking full responsibility, meaning I have to do something.  I can't just say I'm taking full responsibility.  So, you know, we went back and forth a little bit.  I sort of said I would pay for your vacation. 
[02:43:00]  You did?  You said it, yeah.  But then you pumped up the numbers.  So then I decided to crunch my numbers.  They weren't pumped up.  There's receipts for everything.  Oh, boy.  There's a $2,000 phone charge.  What is that?  Well, thanks to Sam and Roland's research, it turns out it would be about $2,000 to get the new phone.  Yeah, but you know what?  I said that maintaining that would be the cost if you kept your old phone active, which you're not doing. 
[02:43:30]  No, it's still active.  I just don't have a phone that's...  The old number's gone.  The old number's gone.  So you have no purpose for a second phone.  Yeah, so I mean...  That's out the window.  I could cut to the chase.  I knocked that right off the bill.  You didn't need a new phone.  Yes.  Yeah, you just changed the number.  So when the Oapster was crunching numbers at home and thinking long and hard about this,  I decided to knock that right off the fucking bill.  All right.  So you knocked that off. 
[02:44:00]  Yes.  That's right out the window.  Do we have a total from E-Rock before we...  What was the total?  We're not going to go to commercial.  That was all a dumb gag last week.  Go to commercial!  No.  Shit.  What a handful.  You talked about your vacation ad nauseum, but we were all scared of you that day, so  we allowed you to talk.  Yeah.  And you gave every single fucking detail of your vacation.  And then we left them hanging with the total, just when you were about to give the total.  What was the total? 
[02:44:30]  The total was just over 9,600.  Whoa!  That's just shy of 10 Gs.  You were asking for 10 Gs for that stunt?  A stack of high...  It wasn't a stunt, you asshole.  Accidental stunt.  Yeah.  So, you know, but I saw the phone thing.  I'm like, okay, that's easy.  That's gone.  That's down to...  That's down to minus 2,000.  Right.  From 9,600.  So you're getting $7,600.  Very nice.  Right.  Cool.  Good for you.  What?  7,600? 
[02:45:00]  No.  No, no, no.  7,600...  What?  No.  7,000.  What happened?  Well, then I took a little taste.  You took a taste?  Of what?  What did you take?  For allowing him in my world.  Oh, man.  You mean finder's fee?  So I took my taste.  Is that the privilege of getting to know you off the air that you were talking about?  Yes.  I see.  What was your taste?  I took another two Gs off it.  My taste.  Oh, I need the whole 9,600, Wade.  So then, you know... 
[02:45:30]  You've just got to talk about your finder's fee.  Right.  So I took a little taste.  Yeah.  So $5,600.  Well, you know...  And then you got to round it.  I'm sure you rounded it.  Up to 6,000.  Up to 6,000.  No, I'm sure you rounded down.  Then I got to thinking.  I mean, it's not just about the money.  Uh-huh.  I felt like it had to be done in a nice way.  Right.  So he did round up.  So I thought of what you really love.  You're paying him in cocks?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
[02:46:00]  One of the things you really love is your weight.  We all know that.  Oh.  How much do you weigh?  You're stalling.  Keep going.  How much is it, though?  I'm guessing about 250 pounds.  When I was crunching numbers...  What?  Wait, these were some of the numbers you were crunching?  Yeah, I was crunching numbers.  Okay.  And I thought he's got to weigh about 250 pounds.  250?  No.  More or less, right?  Close enough?  On the moon.  No.  If I was you, I would admit to 250 right now. 
[02:46:30]  Are you basing poundage per dollar amount or something like that?  No.  No.  $250.  He really crunched some numbers.  I've been crunching and thinking it over.  I wanted to make it special to show that I was very wrong that day.  And I also know you like, you love a good vending machine.  You do love chips.  Snacks is your thing.  You love snacks.  A salted snack in the afternoon.  And where does one get snacks? 
[02:47:00]  A vending machine.  Also loves video games.  Yes.  And you love video games.  Anthony, very good.  Yes, he does.  Didn't you go up to that place?  Fun spot.  Fun spot?  Yeah.  So I decided, Iraq, the make good is very simple.  I am paying you your weight in quarters.  There it is.  I am paying your weight in quarters.  There you go. 
[02:47:30]  I am paying your weight in quarters.  Yes.  Is that 250 pounds of quarters?  Yes.  When I crunched the numbers, I figured it was about 250 pounds.  So I figured I would pay him.  Wow.  That is a fuckload of quarters.  There is 10 boxes of quarters at your feet right now, sir.  I want to be mad, but this is funny. 
[02:48:00]  Oh, Iraq.  Each box weighs 25 pounds.  Can you put them up on the counter, Jim Norton?  Oh, my.  These are fucking heavy.  I have decided to pay your weight in quarters.  Let's see how I'm...  Jeez.  Oh, my God.  You can work out with this.  They're bricks.  They're 25-pound bricks.  Yeah.  You can work out.  And if you do the math, that would be...  I'd maybe do some squats or something.  Yeah. 
[02:48:30]  If you do the math, that would be $5,000 worth of quarters.  Wow.  For my fuck-up.  Five Gs.  Five Gs.  Each box is 500 bucks.  This is a $500 block?  500, yeah, bucks per box.  Are these wrapped?  Yep.  Are you sure?  If they're not, we're going to have a lot of fun in about two fucking minutes.  No, they're wrapped.  There's rolls.  Are they?  Here, put them all on the counter.  They weren't wrapped. 
[02:49:00]  Oh, boy.  For the big photo op.  My fucking Twitter's going to explode.  Jesus Christ.  Don't break the fucking counter.  It's 250 pounds.  I don't know how the fuck you're going to get it out of here.  Oh, boy.  Yeah, does he have something to carry him home in?  Pocket change.  No.  You just fill your pockets with the change.  Yeah, just leave them in your desk for when you need a quarter for the wedding machine.  You're waiting quarters.  You're waiting quarters.  I wouldn't put all of them up there, dude.  Do you think the console could collapse?  Yeah, I don't know if it'll collapse.  No, I've been up on that.  If someone sits up there at 250 pounds, put them up there. 
[02:49:30]  That's a lot of weight, dude.  Put them up.  Stack them up nice, like in a pyramid or something.  It's distributed.  Yeah, it'll be all right.  The weight's being distributed.  It'll be all right.  Oh, boy.  So there you go, E-Rock.  There's your make good.  Wow.  That's really nice.  That's pretty good.  I like it.  E-Rock, that's going to be difficult to get home.  Get in front of it.  Yes, Dad. 
[02:50:00]  And there you have it.  I'm paying E-Rock.  It's weighed in quarters.  There's 10 boxes of quarters.  10 boxes of quarters.  That's $5,000 worth of quarters.  Damn.  Oh, my God.  Each box weighs 200.  If Sam drops it on his foot.  They're really heavy.  Yeah.  Yeah, each box weighs actually 25 pounds.  25 and a half.  25 and a half pounds. 
[02:50:30]  So you're looking at 250 pounds worth of quarters for my foot.  That's crazy.  There you go.  Enjoy.  Enjoy.  What do you have to say, E-Rock?  I guess thank you.  What do you mean, I guess thank you?  Damn right.  This is kind of a dick move.  What?  Kind of.  This is the big payback.  You're not appreciative, man.  I crunched the numbers.  I thought I would do something very nice for you.  Yeah.  And this was it.  Yeah.  Yeah, you're waiting quarters. 
[02:51:00]  I heard he crunched some numbers.  I crunched the numbers, Ant.  Yeah.  A lot of thought into it.  Lucky it wasn't Roland.  Oh, boy.  How about a thank you?  Thank you.  This doesn't quite cover the vacation.  Ooh.  Thank you, Sam.  Oh, man.  What an ingrate.  Going for a bit.  I love it.  E-Rock, are you happy with the amount of money, like quarters aside?  Um, no.  You're not? 
[02:51:30]  No, he's not.  He just gave you $5,000 because he accidentally gave your phone on the air, and you're not happy  with that amount?  Well, E-Rock had his heart set on something.  What did he have his heart set on?  I didn't have my heart set on.  It was, uh, you.  Yeah, exactly.  Are you giving what you promised on the air?  All right.  Take the quarters back, Kenny.  Oh, man.  I'm going to grab one box for me.  Well, I'll take a watch.  Fucking Sam goes to rip him off.  These are good to work out with. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Ooh.  Right?  All right.  This, I'm going to have to move these.  This is starting to bend.  What is?  What's bending?  The console's looking a little...  I don't want the console to bend.  I thought the floorboards.  Oh, jeez.  Oh, Eric.  Eric, do you weigh...  How much...  You weigh 250 pounds, huh?  Yeah, his weight in quarters.  I thought that was a very nice gesture on my part.  That's very nice.  Thank you, Anthony.  I appreciate it.  And it shows how much you know your friend.  Thank you, Sam.  I appreciate it.  How many of us know what our friends weigh like that?  Right.  And now you've got plenty of quarters to play video games and go to the vending machines. 
[02:52:30]  Yeah.  It's beautiful.  All these quarters are going to be gone by noon, though.  Here you go.  Go buy some fucking candy.  Ugh.  Mm-hmm.  That's a lot of Pop-Tarts.  How do you get them home?  Yeah, I don't know.  How about a thank you?  Well, Eric, as time goes on after you know what's happened now, are you feeling better or worse?  Eric, comment.  Actually, this has not helped at all. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, man.  This has not helped.  You're not happy at all.  No.  Well, this is the end of my participation.  I think you've paid a debt.  It ends here.  Thank you, Sam.  It's $5,000.  Yeah.  But, Iraq, what's your thinking?  This ends right here.  This doesn't cover what he said he would.  Oh, wow.  And, too, this is not very convenient.  What do you mean it's not convenient?  You love quarters?  That shit spends.  It's very thoughtful.  Kenny is right.  Opie obviously did put a lot of thought into it. 
[02:53:30]  I did.  Paying your weight in quarters.  That's beautiful.  Yeah.  That's a nice sentiment.  Iraq, will you get all this mess out of here?  Yeah.  Why, Iraq?  You're messy.  Iraq, what are you doing?  Why is he mad?  Well, you know.  He just got $5,000.  That's $5,000.  Are you mad that Opie cut a little off the top for himself?  Uh-oh.  Someone's saying it's actually $4,982.  Ew.  Why is that?  No way.  Why is that, Kevin?  What do you got on this?  All right.  So, the average quarter weighs 5.59 grams. 
[02:54:00]  Kenny's had it.  No.  It's actually over 250 pounds of quarters.  Right.  We just rounded it off.  I weighed the fucking things, and I loved them from the bank to here.  Wow.  All right?  So, go fuck yourself.  Each box weighs over 25 pounds.  It's 25.5 pounds each box.  It's wrapped quarters in a power board.  So, that's another five.  That's what he didn't take into consideration. 
[02:54:30]  So, it's over 250 pounds.  That's Kenny's.  Kenny.  What?  That's Kenny's hand cart that you brought him in with, right?  Yeah.  Kenny needs to take that home.  Yeah.  That's Kenny's.  You can't have that.  You can't have that.  That's Kenny's equipment.  Well, no.  He can have it for like $500.  He can buy it.  A box of quarters.  Yeah.  He can buy it.  Eric, I think we'd all be willing to help you bring these out for a fee.  Yeah.  No.  I know I did the right thing.  Hey, Haynes.  Wow.  E-Rock is still pissed.  I don't care. 
[02:55:00]  I will sleep well at night.  I thought this was very thoughtful.  Extremely thoughtful.  You spent more than that on your vacation, though.  There was thought put into it.  A lot of them.  But I don't know if it was thoughtful.  It's very thoughtful.  Oh, I see why you're...  Because not only did you not get how much you want, but he also took the time to say,  I'll bet E-Rock weighs more than 250 pounds.  Well, I mean, your weight worked out in your favor today.  True, actually.  I thought you weighed about 250.  Who didn't?  If I thought 220, then it would have been 220 pounds of quarters. 
[02:55:30]  That would have been a lot less money.  And if he was going to be a dick about it, he could have paid you in pennies.  Oh, man.  Which we looked into.  We did look into the pennies.  It was so obnoxious.  I forgot how many boxes it was going to be.  That's a lot of pennies, man.  It was going to be something like 100 boxes.  That was a former card delivery.  No joke.  Yeah, yeah.  We got...  Yeah.  Well, he's early, so...  All right.  Yeah, we did think pennies.  But in the end, quarters seemed to be more than acceptable. 
[02:56:00]  You're pissed, though, huh?  Well, that's not my problem.  I know.  I know I did the right thing.  Oh, good for you.  Frederick Hughes is looking down on me today.  Saying, son, you did the right thing.  Way to go, son.  Way to go, son.  That's right.  I hate him.  Remember when I told you...  Frederick Hughes.  Remember when I told you that you can't act like everything's okay before you get the  thing?  The mula.  Because then you end up with a whole bunch of quarters. 
[02:56:30]  $5,000 a quarter.  Yeah.  And what, are you going to be pissed now?  You were not pissed yesterday.  And you didn't have all those quarters.  And you're kind of smiling.  He's okay.  Is he doing a bit?  A little bit.  He is, right?  He'll be all right.  He'll be just fine.  And I think the apology still is more than reasonable.  Because in the end, I'm a good guy.  I could think of 5,000 reasons to give Opie an apology, quite frankly.  You'd take $5,000 worth of quarters, right, Sam?  Holy shit.  Sam, boo! 
[02:57:00]  I want one of those boxes now.  Right.  This guy's saying if I really brought in E-Rock's weight in quarters, you'd be able to retire.  See, that's not nice.  I think I had it figured out at $250,000.  So many quarters.  Yeah.  Bro, you got five grand.  That's wonderful.  Like, what's the problem?  What's the issue here?  Yeah, what is the issue?  Most people would have not made me even give him a fucking dollar knowing that it was by accident. 
[02:57:30]  It's in quarters.  How am I going to get this out of here?  We'll help you.  We'll help you.  It would be great if there was just one quarter on the top of each one where the holes are in the bottom.  And the rest is just bricks or something.  He gets home.  Like the old school scam?  Oh, yeah.  The old New York City scam?  Oh, yeah.  I don't know what he's complaining about.  It's not like it's loose change.  Yeah, it's all wrapped up nice.  It is wrapped up nice.  Oh, did you give him a documentary?  It's silly. 
[02:58:00]  All right.  Beat it.  Very good.  Scram.  Scram.  We got to bring in peers.  Go get your fucking shine box.  Go get your quarters box.  Make sure ten shine boxes.  That's the best you got from us.  I mean, that's the best we have from the past week.  The Opie and Anthony Worst of the Week Countdown is available whenever you want.  On SiriusXM.com.

[03:02:30]  This is Friends of the Show.  Friends of the Show.  Audio entertainment courtesy of the people you hear and hear about on the OPF show.  This week, Robert Kelly's podcast, You Know What Dude.  Well, we got a full show today, as usual, as usual.  Hot show, big show, crazy show.  We got mainly regulars, and we got a new guy, Jermaine Fowler.  What's up?  And if you haven't guessed it, so yeah, he's black. 
[03:03:00]  He's like black black, too.  We've had a lot of very white, white black guys.  Monroe is not white, white black guy.  He just dresses white.  He seems whitish to me.  No, Monroe's in like fucking Philly in like foster care, dude.  He's like a fucking real...  Monroe dresses like he wants more spots.  Like he's been...  That's what he said.  He's trying to get in the alt scene.  Those glasses are just glass.  We got...  Hey, Danny. 
[03:03:30]  Hi.  Where'd you get your shirt?  Gayville?  Good to see that bandana's going to be warming up in my seat.  Wow.  He's picking up on his mayoral run of Gayville.  Mayoral.  That only didn't work because you guys don't know what fucking mayoral means.  No, I'm pretty sure I know what a mayoral means.  Well, you do, but you didn't laugh because you were getting zung.  You fucking didn't know what mayoral means.  That's not a hard word.  You didn't know it until he said it slow the second time. 
[03:04:00]  Mayoral.  And then you laughed, you fucking gorilla.  He loves mayonnaise.  That's what it means.  Talking to Louis.  Listen.  All right, we got...  Let me go around the room.  We have Jermaine.  We have Louis.  We have the pet monkey, Louis.  Put human clothes on him.  He's like a chip in a suit.  Someone shaved him down.  We have monster voice.  Hello.  Apparently regular voice today.  No, that's...  How is that? 
[03:04:30]  That's monstrous.  I don't like your...  I don't like whatever it is going on with you today.  Cocaine.  You're actually very monotone.  Actually, he was nervous that he was late today.  That's why he's actually...  Because I respect the podcast.  Jermaine's strolling up.  I didn't stroll.  Like they're ones to do.  He was nervous that you might scream at him.  That's why he's all like...  No, Dan called.  Dan called.  I told Bobby.  Dan texted me.  Man, we're good, man.  If you call, I'm good.  But Dan shows up early all the time.  He's like Joe List.  They both are very white in the fact that they respect time. 
[03:05:00]  However...  Unlike fucking...  Lewis.  Well, yeah.  Lewis, he has no parents.  So nobody taught him about time.  He didn't go to school.  Wolves are unaware of time.  Yeah, monkeys don't know what time...  They don't know what bananas are.  They don't know what night or day.  I think Lewis is good for that.  Where's your funny today?  Where is it?  Apparently you have it.  This is like gorillas turning on each other. 
[03:05:30]  He actually came in and he said...  Joe said he's getting into shape again.  We go, pick up your shirt.  He picked up his shirt.  It's a mess.  It's a mess.  Oh.  It's a mess.  He's doing training for him.  He looks like an unfinished statue somebody's carving.  It's still holding.  It's like a clay statue they left in the sun.  Wow.  No guy's statue.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Three fucking dead ones.  I said the statue thing.  The funny one.  Everybody laughed.  You can't just do it.  You can't just not finish statue though.  That's not as good.  Well, you didn't punch it up and make it better. 
[03:06:00]  Neither one of you is.  This is really great.  This is just the best time in our whole lives.  Listen.  We're sitting around.  We're being silly.  Come on, everybody.  All right, we got Kelly.  We got Joe List.  Well, this should be a big fucking thing.  Hang on.  I'm going to get there.  Every fucking time, you got to jump it, Joe.  Yeah, but you did.  I run the fucking show.  You fucked up.  Joe, we have two hours.  I can't just zing to it.  I have to slow draw.  You already said it.  Joe, you do a fucking eight-minute podcast if you could.  Come in. 
[03:06:30]  Zing, zing, zing, zing.  And then fucking leave.  Go fuck yourself.  Here's my impression of a Joe List podcast.  Welcome to the Joe List podcast.  It's called Blink With Me.  Are you mad at me?  You're mad at me.  Okay, thanks for listening to the episode.  I had Joe List.  This is a podcast called Small Sips.  If you'd like to hear a Joe List podcast, you can at iTunes.  La, la, la, la, la.  I just think Kelly deserves a big hoopla.  She's getting this.  That's where she's going last. 
[03:07:00]  But you started.  It's recorded.  You're looking, Kelly.  Listen.  No, no.  I went back to you.  I know, but you started.  I went back.  I teased them.  Because I corrected you.  I teased them.  No, you didn't.  Yeah.  Joe List is here.  Tell the listeners at home.  Something big is happening.  Bobby has a new haircut.  He's got long hair.  Joe List.  It's like Hulk Hogan hair.  It's going to be so brutal.  We've got Chris, a.k.a.  Fat Ass.  Yeah, it's like I'm on the outside looking in. 
[03:07:30]  A.k.a.  I have a weird birthmark on my lip.  It looks like I ate spaghetti.  Chris, all the time.  A dunk-a-dunk Scopo.  Chris, midget-ass Scopo.  I'm getting midget-ass a lot.  If you need any help, I'll be right over here.  You understand that Willow was the greatest movie of all time.  You're Mad Monaghan.  He's fucking Willow.  That's what I was going to call him.  He's not just.  I was going to call him Willow Butt. 
[03:08:00]  He's not just a midget.  He's a midget from the 20s.  Hey, what the?  What do you say?  You're getting wise with my midget voice.  And of course, last but not least.  Oh, man.  Well.  A lot of people have been asking for the return of.  Not a lot.  Three.  Three people.  That's seven.  That's ten.  Have been asking for the return of Kelly.  Foster mom face for Stuka.  I was going to call her Dight Taker. 
[03:08:30]  Jermaine, get off your fucking phone.  There's no phones on the show.  During my introduction?  You're turning it down?  What do you mean turning it down?  He's not a police officer.  You're explaining what I have to do.  That's what he's used to.  It's not a gun.  Kelly, you're back.  Hey, mate.  How do you feel?  I feel great.  It feels good to be back.  Had a good break.  All right, Joe.  How do you feel?  I feel that we had a really good run.  Good shows.  And it was a lot of fun.  I think Kelly looks sexy. 
[03:09:00]  She's got a new haircut.  It looks like maybe she's lost a couple pounds.  I haven't.  She looks like a curator for a museum.  Why?  This was the coat Abraham Lincoln wore.  Kelly's got the haircut of a fucking dolphin trainer.  That would be the funniest thing Louis has ever said.  Ever.  Ever.  You should leave.  Go back to hammer fisting.  Thank you very much, Lee.  No, go back to the woods.  Just live there.  Fucking woods. 
[03:09:30]  What are you talking about?  You mean the upper east side?  I thought it was really good, but I wouldn't even put it in the top ten.  You've got a lot of good pearls.  But I agree that you should leave.  Kelly's snorting.  Is that new?  Oh, did you miss it?  Listen.  I missed you guys.  What the fuck are you writing?  Vastuka, where did you get your haircut?  I'm in Australia.  Really?  Yeah.  It was too short.  I know it was too short.  Is that Aussie rules haircut?  I like it.  Did it get caught in the door for the airplane as you were going home?  I like it a lot. 
[03:10:00]  I like it a lot.  The fuck, your mane's black.  He laughs at anything.  It was funny though.  Kelly went to the Australian barber and said, give me the Nate Bargazze.  I'm the alien.  He's got Nate hair.  You need a college hat.  You need a college basketball hat.  Everybody on this side of the room has a different version of the same shitty hair.  What are you talking about?  All of you.  Don't be mad that we have hair.  You're just mad that we have hair.  I got a nice pullback.  Yeah, he's got fucking John Cusack hair.  He's got Nicholas Cage. 
[03:10:30]  You'll have hair.  He really does.  Joe has, it could be a wig hair.  Scopo's got working on a car hair.  Yeah, he has regular Joe hair.  It's like, yeah.  He has 50s hair.  Greaser.  I had the 50s hair.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Soda has soda hair.  Nothing else.  Nobody has hair quite like your hair.  I don't know, man.  I'm not saying it's great or terrible.  I'm saying it's soda hair.  I've seen some floats in Mardi Gras with hair like his.  Wait a minute.  You can't laugh and then get, Joe, you laugh. 
[03:11:00]  I didn't get it, but here's what you do.  This is what you do sometimes.  You convince me that it's funny because you're like this.  He's got floating Mardi Gras hair.  I'm like, I must have been big, whatever that was.  I muscle you into laughing.  Yes, you do.  Are you saying it does the verbal equivalent of flinching at you?  He's like, yeah.  Yeah, he does, but I don't know.  I've never been to Mardi Gras, though.  It's in New Orleans.  I'm not familiar with New Orleans.  New Orleans.  And then we got Jermaine. 
[03:11:30]  You got great hair, too.  I suppose.  He's got black people hair.  What the fuck does that mean, Chris?  Nappy.  It's terrible.  It's a nappy.  It's shitty.  What the fuck?  I don't need two fucking Lewises here, okay?  He's got black parts of it.  He's got black people hair.  It's fucking what?  Nappy?  Scrub my dishes with it.  Dude, that hair will give you fucking rashes if you touch it.  You ever put a black guy in a headlock?  Oh, murder on your forearm.  Dude, I did that once. 
[03:12:00]  The whole fucking inside of my forearm was fucking red for two weeks.  What the fuck?  So, Jimmie's just not okay with all this racism.  He's not laughing.  He's not...  Who said Nappy?  He said Nappy.  I called you.  I just met you.  The worst part is I've met Jermaine five times in my life.  Oh, I don't remember you.  Yeah, I know.  Oh!  Oh!  He said your personality is Nappy.  Pass that down here.  Oh!  Oh!  Why that dance is for me?  To make me feel good. 
[03:12:30]  Because you're black.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  That was Lewis.  The same racist tone were you two.  Listen, Lewis...  It's contagious.  Lewis is a racist.  Lewis and George Zimmerman are not white.  I just want to put that out there.  Thank you very much.  Thanks for being out there.  You're welcome.  Well, I'm glad to have you back, Kelly.  I think so.  I appreciate it.  But I tell you this.  Chris Scopa did a great job.  Tremendous job.  And here's how much of a good job he did.  We're going to keep him around.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because I'll let you know, your donations and your supporting our sponsors... 
[03:13:00]  Have allowed us to, in the, you know what, did studios.  We're going to be getting a Ustream video.  It's being set up.  We just got a new computer for the studio.  So we're getting rid of this one.  And we're going to have a new one with a monitor.  And we're going to have...  Kelly's going to move over to Badoosa. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, boy.  Oh, shit.  Of the show.  Damn.  And Chris is going to be the intern of the show.  So Chris will be the...  I think Chris is better, too, to do that.  Because people don't give him...  They don't fuck with him as much as Kelly.  You know what I'm saying?  Well, Chris doesn't put Darrell in his...  Yeah, we also like him.  Also, his personality is just now coming out.  If we all knew he was a fucking racist, maybe we would have been shitting on him a little  later.  I mean...  Talk to him in the microphone.  I am from New York a little bit.  I feel...  This is, like, weird.  I feel like I'm on the outside looking in.  Pull it up.  Pull it up.  I can't even see it. 
[03:14:00]  It looks like a cock right here.  I've got to hold it up.  It really looks like a robot dick right in your face.  Yeah, it really does.  It's like right here.  If it wasn't black, would you be comfortable talking to him?  Yeah.  Oh, shit.  What's the thing going on right now, dude?  I like how sexy Jermaine is when he fucks with you.  His eyes get squinty and then his mouth opens just a little bit.  He gets Keith's sweat face.  I don't know why I thought you were going to say Keith Robinson for some reason.  Yeah, you infuriate me.  Oh, shut up, Jermaine.  I don't know.  Oh, stop it.  You're bothering me now.  Yeah, you infuriate me.  Sweet heavens, sweet heavens, sweet heavens. 
[03:14:30]  Where are you from, Jermaine?  Born in D.C., raised in Maryland.  Really?  Mm-hmm.  Do you work in the Goobies?  Yeah, once with Mike Burton.  Really?  Mike Burton, the magician?  No, he's just a regular stand-up.  Oh, really?  Is he a white dude, a black dude?  What is he?  White.  White dude.  Really?  Now, how long have you been in New York City?  Since 08.  About five years now.  You've been here for five years?  I've known you for three months.  Five years.  Yeah.  What did you say?  He said five years.  He didn't use the V.  Five.  What the fuck is wrong with you, Lewis? 
[03:15:00]  What?  What are you doing?  I'm fucking crazy.  It's my friend Jermaine.  All right, but why?  You're from the hood.  All right, what the fuck?  You're not from the hood.  You're from Nyack.  I'm from West Tavistro, which is the hood of Nyack.  What is it?  Explain.  What do you mean?  It's the ghetto area of Rockland County.  Isn't that white ghetto?  Was that New York?  Yeah, upstate.  Oh, okay, okay.  Semi-upstate.  They have trees and shit up where he was from.  Yeah, he'll guess on trees or something.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What?  I'm bombing.  Oh, my God.  It's just uncomfortable.  I miss Lewis.  Don't look.  I miss Lewis. 
[03:15:30]  Jermaine's not my new friend.  I've known Jermaine longer than I've known most of the people in this room.  You're not true.  More than me?  More than I've known you?  I mean, yeah.  I know.  I think so.  No.  I met you when you were a fucking trench coat wearing asshole.  Walking around looking like you were going to murder people instead of fucking make  them laugh.  I knew when you used to wear a hat.  Hey, I got a show on Tuesday.  Up at, uh, near some tickets.  Can you still do that, actually?  Tickets.  You don't like that.  You want to stop by?  Are you on the show? 
[03:16:00]  No, I'm just selling tickets to you.  You breathe harder, Les, now.  Oh, yeah, I'm less than that.  I used to breathe real hard.  All the time.  Now you kind of controlled everything.  Ah-ha, your friend's smashing you.  How do you feel now?  I used to breathe so hard.  I'm really mad, Lewis.  I've known him for longer than I've known him.  What?  For longer than?  What's wrong with you?  What's wrong, Lewis?  You're so quiet.  You're giving me a headache.  I don't know what's going on right now.  I don't know.  Relax, bronchitis voice.  It's all good.  Oh.  Too ready.  I don't like that fuck. 
[03:16:30]  Can someone please give Dan cocaine, please?  No.  I don't like me.  Do you just have therapy?  Whatever.  Yeah.  Did you have therapy today?  Yeah.  What'd I tell you, Dan?  Then, Dan, it's Tuesday.  That's when I see you, Alan.  You don't fucking...  We had a good emotional jam session today.  I don't...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You cried?  Yeah.  What'd you cry about?  That's right.  Didn't I say when he walked in, your fucking energy was weird?  It's not weird.  It's great.  It is weird.  I don't need you normal.  It is weird.  I need you fucked up and anxious. 
[03:17:00]  That's goofy, Dan.  And ready to go.  I think he's upset because it got rained on in Colorado.  Are you still...  The rain?  Are you talking about my mom's house flooding?  Are you bringing up more?  Did it really flood?  Yeah.  Your basement did, yeah.  Your mother's house flooded?  Yeah.  All my pictures from when I was a kid were in the wall.  All three of them?  Oh, that's like your dad dying all over again.  I know, right?  Jesus Christ.  Jesus Christ.  Dan, I'm sorry.  Listen.  It's okay.  Listen.  I'm in a place where I can handle it now, Bobby.  Dan, I'm sorry about that.  All those memories died now.  Hey, psych, guys.  Do you remember Amy from Congo, the monkey that could talk?  Yes.  That's what I'm talking about, please. 
[03:17:30]  That's like if she was ready.  Amy, Matt.  Amy, Matt.  Amy, Amy, what?  But if Amy had the voice that was like, Amy, Matt.  Yes.  Amy, I'm from Rockland, Colorado.  I'm from...  Not Nyack.  I can use the N-word.  No, Jermaine's my nigga friend.  Amy, say N-word.  Amy, like N-word.  Ah, shit.  Oh, man. 
[03:18:00]  Your dad's still dead, though.  Jesus Christ.  At least my dad went out by his own account, not getting his life taken by a knife.  Wait.  Is that true?  Yeah, my dad was stabbed to death.  That is actually...  Wait, now that I think about it, it's way cooler than how my dad died.  How'd your dad die?  Alcoholism?  Just being super fun all the time.  Alcoholism.  I don't know, by being the most hardcore Jimmy Buffett fan ever.  That one deserved way more.  That's fucking hilarious.  He's drinking so much rum.  What do you think is better, being stabbed or dying with just a shitty liver? 
[03:18:30]  I don't know.  The tune of Margaritaville just jamming to your head day after day?  I don't talk to my kids.  Getting stabbed in an alley or fucking dying at Dick's Last Resort?  Drinking out of a coconut.  Tell that big-headed kid of mine, I said I'd like him.  Yeah, tell him he's okay.  He's not bad.  He'll never feel comfortable watching an emotional movie. 
[03:19:00]  Tell him I hope that fucking head doesn't get bigger than it is.  Tell him that head's from his mom's side, the bitch.  Cheeseburger in paradise.  Oh, Louis' dad just going,  Ask him, I'm not.  I said, no, he's my baby.  Hello, mijo.  Hello.  Tell me, mijo, I love him.  Tell me, tell me, monkey boy.  The blade is so sharp. 
[03:19:30]  Ay, ay, chai, chai.  My intestine, ay, chai, chai.  Chai, chai, chai.  I love that his fucking dad's from Tijuana.  Ay, chai, chai.  Chigley, chigley.  He's Filipino.  Oh, shit.  His dad's Filipino.  This motherfucker.  I don't want to fight Mayweather.  His dad's got Pacquiao voice.  I ate the hottest pepper ever.  The goose pepper is hard.  Like they're blading to your sternum.  Did I eat a dragon pepper or did I get stabbed? 
[03:20:00]  Ay, chai, chai.  That's his dad's catchphrase.  What if Floyd Mayweather senior stabbed your dad?  We just did not know.  Come on.  Every time Lewis opens a beer with that fucking cock can opener, he tries to suck it.  You know, can I just say something?  This is how I know Lewis has sucked a dick.  The way he put that in his mouth.  No teeth.  No teeth.  Just lips.  Yep. 
[03:20:30]  Lewis has sucked a dick.  He smacks it against his tongue.  Lewis has...  Who's a naughty girl?  I'm a naughty girl.  Oh, God.  Are you not getting...  Who's not getting...  I just did it for an hour...  A minute and 40 seconds.  You got him sucking it?  No.  I didn't get to suck it.  Why the fuck?  Who gives a fuck?  You got a minute and 40 seconds of us doing shitty jokes on Jermaine being black.  Yeah.  Bobby, we do have a lot of footage of Lewis sucking dick already.  What?  Oh, yeah.  I bought you guys presents.  No food in the fucking studio.  Caramel, koalas, and cherry rice.  Don't get mad at me.  What is this?  Don't get mad at me, Dan.  Look at Dan. 
[03:21:00]  I'm looking for Danny.  I didn't fucking do it.  You can have some.  We'll take a break and you can have some.  Do I have any candy in the studio?  Shut up.  No.  Why?  Did you have candy?  No.  You ate candy, didn't you?  I would never eat candy in the studio.  Are you crazy?  I was just testing to make sure nobody could do...  God.  Candy in the studio.  I know.  Anyways, Kelly, so now that you're back...  Yeah, mate.  Did you want to come back?  Were you excited to come back to the show?  Yeah.  Or were you happy that you were away from the show for this time?  Was it a relief?  Did you need a break from us?  Were you dying to get back?  Did it scare you that Chris was doing so good? 
[03:21:30]  And then you left and this show didn't fucking skip a beat?  It got better.  Did it get better?  I was just happy not to work for three weeks.  Because I hate my job.  But I missed you guys.  Did you miss the show?  I did.  Really?  Was it hard for you to listen to it?  I didn't want to listen to it without me on it.  Really?  Yeah.  That's fucking really egotistical of you.  Yeah.  It is.  You know?  Do you listen to it?  What, do you want a beer?  Yeah.  Yeah, grab a fucking beer.  Stop whispering.  I don't understand.  What are you, under 21?  I didn't want to talk over. 
[03:22:00]  Hey, man.  Just go get me a beer.  Yeah, Kelly's obviously telling an interesting story.  I will pick it up, dude.  It was an accident.  It's not an accident.  You're a fucking ape.  He's got tap-out socks on.  What a fucking asshole.  Amy, wear socks.  Oh, you're fucking serious.  That's what I agree.  Oh, you are a real ass dude.  I am a real ass dude.  I fucking, I take care of, uh, I buy shit from the MMA companies that I respect.  Really?  Yeah.  That's great.  Good for you.  Glow-in-the-dark tap-out socks.  They make my feet stink. 
[03:22:30]  They're like the worst socks ever.  Maybe your feet make the socks stink.  Yeah, I think that's the way it works.  That's not true.  There's not certain socks that you wear that just fucking make your feet sweat?  No.  No, no.  Absolutely not.  I usually take a shower and my feet are good.  Dude, I have this thing.  We got to talk about this.  I'm my asshole right now.  It's called a dumb brain.  I don't know if it's like what you had, but there's something going on in my ass.  Is it a ball sack?  I'm the ass professor.  What is it?  Wait a minute.  Do we have a theme song for that?  It's another episode of Ass Professor. 
[03:23:00]  I'm going to solve your asshole problems.  We're Kelly Fasuka.  I'm Kelly Fasuka.  Asshole Professor.  Coming from Australia to look at your asshole.  Say the serious.  Looking at buttholes.  Singing in koalas.  Today in the studio we have Louis Gomez.  Louis has a problem with his asshole.  Louis, what's going on?  It's like, who's what?  Talk to the doctor.  Don't look at me.  The professor.  The professor.  I'm Dr. Gomez. 
[03:23:30]  You know that.  Sorry.  There's like on my ass.  I thought it was a hemorrhoid at first.  I woke up today and I've been working out for the past week pretty hard.  Maybe I got another hemorrhoid.  I know it.  So then I went in the bathroom.  I checked it.  I noticed that it's on the side.  Wait.  Stop.  Stop.  So I need to know how you can check your own asshole.  With your fingers.  Come on.  Louis puts his foot in Jermaine's nose.  I love it.  Jermaine really fucking.  That N-word was real.  That was like the one they don't want us to use. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, God.  That might have been the most sincere moment in the history of the show.  Yes, right there.  Come on.  That was fucking crazy.  I had that like sit up straight where you're like, that was real.  You shut him.  It's so shut her.  Now Jermaine feels about Louis the way we all feel about Louis.  You rub your finger on the inside of your ass crack.  Okay.  Slow down.  Slow down.  Just slow down for a second.  You lick your finger before you do it.  You rub your fingers.  I didn't say make it sexist.  That was nice.  Keep going.  You're saying you masturbate to check your ass? 
[03:24:30]  Do you put a mirror down there or do you just check your ass?  Oh, I put my one leg up on the bathtub.  There I go.  Stop.  Do you wear your tap out socks while you wear it?  Just my tap out socks.  That's why your feet stink.  Because you put your socks on your hands while you checked your asshole.  Listen.  So you put your leg up, my foot up on the bathtub.  On the bathtub.  Spread my eyes.  Let me just stop one second.  Slow down.  We need to get a visual on this.  I'll show you right now.  Are you naked?  And I pull my pants down. 
[03:25:00]  I'm topless.  So you're topless.  That's what bad guys are.  They're topless.  So you have no shirt on, but you have jeans or sweatpants?  Do I have a bottle?  Underwear.  Boxers.  So you've got boxes on.  So you pull your boxes off.  Around my knees.  So how do you get one leg up with the things that are around your knees?  Because I like to challenge my core while I do everything.  So you only checked it one time.  It doesn't show.  You only checked it once.  Listen.  The core of you is stupid.  It means your personality. 
[03:25:30]  How did you put a knee up?  A leg up?  I put my...  You were naked.  No, no, no.  I pull them down, like, not around my knees, but, like, around my thighs.  So how did you put a leg up?  Dude, it's not that hard.  They're elastic in the waist.  Listen.  I get that you wear wooden boxer shorts, but I have elastic ones.  What?  Wooden boxer shorts, guys.  What am I, Dutch?  I just imagine Lewis squatting over a mirror.  This is all a lie.  You have a leg up.  Yeah.  One leg on the...  Left leg on the fucking...  Is the left leg outside of the underwear a bolt? 
[03:26:00]  Both...  Oh, no.  Just do it.  Show us.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Get the video.  Get the video.  No, do it with your underwear.  Do it with your underwear.  Just do it.  Oh, gross.  Yeah, tap out underwear.  At the top of his butt.  Where?  Oh, no.  All right, wait one second.  Show me.  Show me.  We're not going to do your ass on video.  Just do the side.  All right, stop the video.  Show your ass too, Chris.  Can we put one of the microphone things on his dick?  I want to see Chris's ass too.  No, all right.  So what do we do?  I do one of these.  Okay, Kelly, look.  Kelly, look.  No, no. 
[03:26:30]  No, no.  Bobby, what'd you see, Bobby?  What'd you see, Bobby?  Bobby, what'd you see?  Bobby, what'd you see?  Bobby's going to throw up.  Bobby, what'd you see?  Bobby's going to throw up.  Oh, my God.  What'd you see, Bobby?  Explain it, Bobby.  This is the purest form of growing up.  It looked like if someone buried a kitten.  Oh, it was so hairy.  It was so hairy.  Buried a kitten in cookie dough.  Oh, God.  Like if you pushed a kitten into the center of cookie dough and let the cookie dough eat  the kitten.  It was so dark.  And the kitten was trying to fight its way out. 
[03:27:00]  It was so dark.  Oh, I did get that on tape, though.  Oh, come on, dude.  Don't put my ass on the internet.  Why is your asshole?  Why does it go light skin to dark skin to light skin?  Look at how you sat in paint.  Pitt's black.  Like a Neapolitan.  No, I have a dark, like, the line, let me tell you, the line that goes down my ass is  pretty dark.  Like, if you ask me, I'll put my balls in dick.  So it's like I'm being like, like a dark hand just grabbing my asshole in dick. 
[03:27:30]  Can you do me a favor?  What?  Will you let Beatrice go?  Will you just let her?  Like, fire her from LOL books?  No, let her, let her go.  I need her to do that.  Let her go find somebody she should be with.  Let her go.  She's stuck.  Just let her take the kitten and go.  You just need an angle bleaching.  Are you saying Louis needs to have a white fang ending with his baby's mama?  I'm just saying.  Get out of here.  Get out of here.  No one wants you here.  I'm just saying.  You need to leave.  You're going to be a fan of the opera.  I'm just saying. 
[03:28:00]  I don't think Beatrice knew about what I just saw.  Can I tell you?  She's the one who confirmed that it wasn't cancer or a hemorrhage because I showed her.  That's love.  Dude, that is love.  Not only that, dude.  She was fucking.  I'm talking about this far from my asshole.  Write this down.  I want to give $50 to Beatrice.  Okay.  Just $50.  Is that how much looking at Louis' ass it's worth?  $50?  Here's the thing, dude.  I can't get it out of my head.  Did you see what I was talking about?  It looked like a sea rock. 
[03:28:30]  It was just dark and had barnacles and things swooping off of it.  Dude, did you see what I'm talking about, though?  The bump.  Is it still there?  No.  Well, I popped it.  Don't do that, man.  What came out?  What color was it?  It was oily.  Like an oil.  Did I squeeze it?  It was like.  Wait a minute.  Why don't you?  How do you know you don't do it?  Why?  It's probably just a pimple.  But here's the thing.  No, it's bigger than a pimple and it's almost like.  It gets infected.  It's long.  Almost like it was like a row of pimples. 
[03:29:00]  Like two or three pimples in a row.  But it was like.  Imagine like a half.  That sounds like herpes.  Literally.  Wow.  Don't say that.  You got fucked in the ass.  Who fucked you in the ass?  Who could be the best podcast ever?  Did I find out that I have anal herpes?  Listen, you can't pop herpes.  Yeah, you can.  No, you can.  I know this.  Yeah, you can.  Yeah, you can.  No, I actually asked my doctor because I popped something.  We're talking to a guy who has herpes.  You can pop herpes.  I mean, if it's a blister, you could pop.  It's like a blister.  Why are you making me think that I have herpes on my asshole?  You do.  Because you described what sounds like herpes on your asshole. 
[03:29:30]  It's all right.  So someone with herpes fucked you in the ass.  That's what it also could be.  What's the big deal?  What it also could be.  A friend of mine.  He's a comedian, right?  He told me that.  Oh, boy.  I bet he doesn't say the same thing about you.  That's insane.  Who?  You got to name names.  He just says a friend of mine.  Dan Wilber.  I don't like Dan therapy.  I'm listening.  I don't like listening.  I like interacting, Dan.  I'm interacting. 
[03:30:00]  We need to either switch the day we fucking do the show or switch your fucking therapy day.  Because you're human right now.  I don't need fucking human Dan.  You're close to done with therapy anyways.  Yeah, thanks.  Are you really?  No.  Oh.  Never.  Do we get any sponsors for Lewis for therapy?  People sponsoring in?  Not one fucking person.  Oh, man.  They don't want to fix me.  They want me to be me.  The fans.  When I had a problem, my asshole people donated money.  For us, I'd go to a doctor.  No one donated money to you?  Give them an asshole doctor.  Kelly, it's not because they like you more than me. 
[03:30:30]  Why is it?  They thought you might be at the doctor the day of a show and they get you off one show.  Too wordy.  Too wordy.  Too long.  I kind of liked it.  I still was with them.  I liked the sentiment.  He just fucked up the delivery.  I understood what he meant.  That's called Lewis.  So what kind of stuff came out?  Was it clear?  It was like a corner?  I think it's a pimple, honestly, but it's just a fucking weird angle.  The pimple's almost...  Imagine you jabbed a pen in your ass at a side angle.  All of them rubbing together.  And you've got to get in there when you shower.  You've got to really get in there. 
[03:31:00]  No, I do get in there when I shower, dude.  So it could be an ingrown hair that's growing sideways.  No, because an ingrown hair doesn't pop.  Yeah, it does.  It does.  It does.  For sure.  Can it be?  Yeah.  What is it?  Jermaine knows what it is.  Listen, Ben told me sometimes when he poops, some of the doo-doo gets trapped in between  his skin and his asshole.  And it grew over the years.  And basically, what you might have is fecal matter in your skin.  Don't pop it.  It might affect your... 
[03:31:30]  Ew.  You're a try-asshole.  What the fuck was just said?  He said that he had poop under the skin.  Like a leak in the colon.  Like he didn't wipe his ass and then the skin grew around it.  Jermaine's friend is part poop.  It's thrown into his DNA.  That explained Dan Wilber's act.  I've never met him.  How did they fix it?  They kept their asshole?  What's the doctor, I think?  What's the doctor?  Got that poop out.  You might have poop in you. 
[03:32:00]  I don't think no.  You got that old poopy butt.  No, you got that poop in your eye.  Look at that.  Did he squeeze it?  I saw one of my friends one day and he was walking funny.  I'm talking to Reginald.  Reginald said I got poop butt.  I said, what does that mean?  He said my butt poop.  My nigga cornbread.  He got that poop in his eye.  You might have it.  So if you pop it, just shit sprays out?  No, it wasn't shit that sprayed out of it.  No, no.  Here's the thing.  What came out was like a pimple.  Okay.  Like what's that?  Puss or juice?  Pussy, like clear and white.  Like juice.  Puss.  You have a shit. 
[03:32:30]  A shit.  A shit.  A shit.  How many zits do you think were in a row?  That's not bad.  Here's the thing.  It would have to be...  Here's what I think.  The only way to explain it.  You know how a zit is like long ways.  Let's say it comes out, right?  What do you mean?  Risen.  You mean risen.  Risen.  Right.  A zit is risen.  It's not long ways, you fucking dumb asshole.  Long ways like months.  You know a zit is like long ways.  Not the long zit.  Yeah.  The fat zit.  Yeah.  Look, a zit goes long, right? 
[03:33:00]  Lewis is describing it like a cartoon welt.  It's like...  That's what I'm saying.  That's a zit, though.  Exactly.  That's like a zit.  It's risen.  It's risen.  Fine.  All right.  That's fine.  Imagine the zit or the thing.  It went sideways.  Like it grew sideways as opposed to rising out of the skin.  You have shit under your skin.  Yeah.  I might just have shit under my skin.  Yeah, poop me.  You have herpes and shit under your skin in the form of a zit.  When you busted it, did it smell?  Busted it.  No.  I mean, my fingers did afterwards. 
[03:33:30]  When you popped it up.  When you busted it.  When you gave it an old rump up.  And you made an activity deal.  Who do you call when your windshield's busted?  Asshole professor.  Nope.  It's the asshole professor.  Learning about buttholes.  Teaching people about buttholes.  I missed you guys.  Butthole professor. 
[03:34:00]  Wish we could say the same about you.  I know you don't mean that, Joe.  No one's had that problem before besides our hemorrhoid.  I've had, I had a, I had an ingrown hair a long time ago.  Early 20s.  Was it when you were sexy Bobby?  Sexy Bobby.  Back in the early 1920s.  Not the 20s.  What's the go-team?  What's the go-team?  I remember I just fell out of a car with suicide doors.  Well, I just wanted to say suicide doors and then I threw in falling out of a car for  some reason. 
[03:34:30]  We wish that would happen right now.  What do you mean?  Like I would get hurt?  No, just suicide.  You want me to get hurt?  Uh, no, just, that was funny, Lewis.  I got an ingrown hair in between my ball sack and my leg.  On your, huh?  Oh, not on the ball sack.  On the leg part.  I know, it hurt.  But I, I kept picking it.  I thought it was a zit.  It got infected.  And I remember girls would be blowing me and they'd stop.  What the fuck?  Like I had a, I had a chick stop and she was like, yeah, what, what is that?  And she was like, I'm, I'm good.  I don't know what that is. 
[03:35:00]  She tapped out.  She tapped out.  It was so fucking nasty.  And it took months.  I had to just leave it.  Yeah.  And let it go.  And it, it like healed on its own.  Like I really, cause what happens with ingrown hairs, you so want to pop it so you can see  that hair.  Yeah.  Pull it.  Yeah.  And pull it out.  And, and, but it never happens like that.  Well, yeah.  If, if, if, while you've had it done.  Well, uh, when you let it wait for a little bit and you see like it poke up a little bit,  you get like a, a tweezer and just pull it up.  It looks.  Have you had it?  Like between your, yes, I've had that before. 
[03:35:30]  On your balls?  Yeah.  Just put a little sporn on it.  Just goes away.  Really?  Would you look at Jermaine's fucking evil fingernails?  What the fuck is going on with your hands, dude?  I don't bite him.  He's got Nosferatu fingers.  What the fuck?  Dude, that's a black thing.  Get black dudes, let their fingernails grow.  Look at it.  Look at them.  I'm looking.  He's part kitty cat.  Jermaine's part kitty cat.  What you talking about, man?  Hey, shit, man. 
[03:36:00]  What's wrong with it?  I mean, his fingernails, he's just got long.  It's not that his fingers are the best.  They're not too long.  It's the best.  He's just got long fingers.  I'm going to bite these shit, man.  Yeah.  Chris Rock would be like, those are some long fingernails, motherfucker.  Anyway.  Yeah, I wouldn't bite your fingers, either.  They're gross.  Why?  You just didn't.  Yes, you would.  I would.  I just bite it.  It's for the look.  I don't like it.  It's getting jiggy with it, reference.  Will you stop rocking like a fucking psychopath?  I always rock like an autistic kid that's into Will Smith. 
[03:36:30]  That's the right thing.  He needs sugar.  Definitely getting jiggy with it.  I've got references.  All the lyrics and meanings.  Definitely walk on to Miami.  Devinito Ami-Ami.  Will Smith in the Philadelphia.  Can somebody, is Chris just standing there smiling?  Is that all he's doing?  He's just looking.  I can't even see it.  I have videoed it the whole time.  A second.  Put the mic.  I can't hear you.  Talk into the microphone.  Everyone's right here.  Racism come from a haircut.  I can't see anything.  Hey, Lou, you know what you're doing?  Put some toothpaste on the pimple, whatever it is. 
[03:37:00]  Yep, yep.  The toothpaste will dry out and pull out any extra oil that's there.  If you put fucking minty toothpaste on your asshole, I swear to God, this would be the  best prank ever if that's the worst thing you can do to your asshole.  Just fucking close my asshole shut.  I would love it.  Go to a doctor.  He's like, that makes your asshole lose elasticity.  I don't know.  I don't think a doctor would call it an asshole.  I would love it if it just bleached your asshole.  Your asshole is just white, black, and then white.  Beatrice, wash off this toothpaste. 
[03:37:30]  It's burning my butthole.  Why would you do this?  That's burning my butthole.  By the way, even Dan, can I tell you what's going on?  Dan, that was funny, but normal Dan would have fucking boomed.  He would have nailed that.  He would have boomed.  I don't know.  I don't like what he's doing right there.  No, what you're doing, I'm telling you, I'm giving you an honest assessment because  we're fucking friends, dude.  Honest assessment.  And I'm a real ass dude.  I don't lie to motherfuckers.  That's right.  That was a quiet Dan.  All right, man.  I liked it.  I liked this Dan.  First of all, Dan, don't listen to Joe.  Don't listen to Joe. 
[03:38:00]  Don't ever listen to Joe.  I think it's a great Dan.  He secretly wants you to fail.  Okay?  You're quiet and then you come in with the thing and you say you're not loud enough?  Louis Gomez is telling you you're not loud enough.  Louis J. Gomez.  Whatever.  The J stands for real jerk.  The R is silent.  I think you're narrowing it.  I think Chris is a little racist.  Jermaine's doing a nice thing over there.  I'm not sure what it is.  Louis is always good-ish. 
[03:38:30]  Kelly, I mean, what a bummer.  Bobby, you're dropping the ball, but, you know, I think we're doing all right.  I think we're doing good.  I think this end is doing fantastic.  Right.  I like Chris.  It's good.  I think...  It just got brighter in here.  Now I got Tucker again.  What?  You noticed that, right?  Am I having a stroke?  Yeah.  I hope so.  Another one will make me happier.  Tiny mouth is slanted.  Yeah.  Can't even tell he's having a stroke because it's so small. 
[03:39:00]  I'm like, guys, look real close.  Real close.  I got one of those diamond appraisal things on.  Yeah.  Slanted.  Nobody's helping.  He's like, it fucking smells like burnt hair.  It fucking...  Meanwhile, Scopo's like...  Scopo's just sitting in the corner going, the blacks are the Jews' muscles.  Scopo's...  That's not true, is it?  Oh, shit.  I can't believe you whipped out your asshole. 
[03:39:30]  Right?  How can you not believe that?  That's Lewis.  If you were like Lewis, whipped out his asshole, I'd be like, yeah, that's just what Lewis does.  The only one who would do it.  But this is the thing.  If I knew my asshole, and he does know his asshole looks like that, it's just the darkness.  It's fucking dark.  It was like looking into a black hole.  It's fucking terrible.  You didn't spread it.  Yeah, he did.  You didn't spread it.  It's the same creepy...  I have it on video if you want to see it.  No, thanks.  This is obscure, but...  Remember, like, Looney Tunes cartoons? 
[03:40:00]  Yes.  And they would throw...  They had, like, a black circle, and then they would throw it on the wall.  Yeah.  People would run through it, and the next guy would try.  It looked like that asshole.  Yeah, you have a black asshole, like a ring.  Like, your asshole is like a circle.  No, my asshole's like a videotape from the ring.  You watch it, you have to pass it on to other people.  There's a little girl in there.  It does give me a creepy feeling.  Like staring at the woods at night.  What you have on your ass, you can totally pass on to other people.  And it doesn't go away.  Yeah, your asshole is really dark and nasty. 
[03:40:30]  Is it really hairy?  No, it's not.  No, it's pretty hairy.  Is it?  It's hairy.  It's hairy.  By the way, that's half the dark.  That's half the dark.  Nah, dude.  Do you get shit stuck in, like, the hair?  Jesus Christ.  No, Kelly.  Kelly.  Let's look at everyone's asshole.  I'm not letting you see my asshole.  That's a gross butthole.  I'm not letting you see my...  Dan, let me see your butthole, dude.  I'm not letting you see your butthole.  No, I don't want to see your butthole.  You want to see Dan's butthole?  I want to see everyone's buttholes.  Let's get them all out there.  Show your butthole.  Show your butthole.  I'm working it towards Kelly.  We'll see her vagina.  Everyone check out their buttholes. 
[03:41:00]  Which looks like Louis' butthole.  Kelly's vagina looks like something the fucking Enterprise could go through.  A wormhole?  The starship Enterprise?  We just found out there's 300 other planets in Kelly's pussy.  That wasn't bad.  This is what bugged me about it.  He got so excited.  He looked at...  We just found out and he took a pause.  Wait for it?  I got one?  Kelly, how long... 
[03:41:30]  Butthole planets.  How long has your asshole been fixed?  I've been good for about a year.  I've got a nice 2012 butthole.  So your asshole doesn't bleed anymore?  No.  Not at all.  But you can't get fucked in it still, right?  No, I've never been fucked in it.  Kelly, what happened to your...  I had an anal fissure in my asshole.  A what?  Which is a...  It's like a tear that happens inside your ass.  How'd that happen?  Everyone, they already know about it.  It just happens.  That was my nickname in college.  The anal fissure. 
[03:42:00]  It just happens.  Yeah, like sometimes it could have been like I was stuck in a long haul flight.  Too many hard shits through time.  Or she...  Hard wiping.  Or her diet of eating broken glass.  Or her fucking...  Her addiction of fucking huge black cock in the asshole.  No, I've never had a dick in my asshole.  You've never had a monster cock in your ass?  No.  Do you have a monster cock in your ass?  How about a thumb?  Hey, baby girl.  Hey, baby girl.  Hey, baby girl.  You ever had a cat hand in your asshole?  You've got to meow before you say it.  Meow.  Meow.  Meow. 
[03:42:30]  Meow.  The fact that he said cat hand and not paw was fucking hilarious.  You've got to...  Look at this cat's hand.  What is this?  What the fuck is this?  It's a cat hand, Jones.  I know.  Lewis, stop holding his  No, dude, it's a cat  He's not your black toy  It's like the toy with Pryor  Stop holding him up  You're mine now 
[03:43:00]  You're my toy  That kid got into gay porn  He did not  The kid from the toy  Is in fun  No, wait, stop  He's not in gay porn  He got into regular porn  He did regular, but he knew who did gay porn  Is evil  From the vampire movie  The interview with the vampire  Tom Cruise  No, the other one  Bela Lugosi  Fright Night  The original Fright Night evil

[03:44:00]  Did you make her bust it or did you bust it yourself?  She wouldn't bust it  I asked her to  I asked her, she refused  Thank God, man  I wonder why  Oh my God  Wait, so the vampire or the kid from  The kid from Fright Night?  Evil  Dude, I think that kid did gay porn too, though  I don't know  We can Google it  I'll look it up  If one of these fucking other cocksuckers  That are supposed to just  Hey, let's find out  He's got my  Do you know his name?  My old boss used to do gay porn  What?  Really?  Dan Soda was your old boss?

Bobby, why would you say that?  I took it too far  It's not funny, Bobby  So I heard what you said to Dan on the show  So I hear you're apparently saying that he sucks my cock  When I'm trying to help him emotionally 
[03:45:00]  If anybody's a faggot, it's you, Bobby  You're a pussy, Bobby  Was that Brachy Milligan?  Yeah, he did  No, that's our therapist  Oh, you got the same joke?

[03:51:00]  That's what happens  Everyone knows it's the queers that got porn  We're all out there having queer sex  Wait, are we not going to pretend that AIDS is pretty much a gay and black thing?  Wait a minute  I'm kidding  It really is  I wasn't kidding  First of all, it's not a black thing  It is  It is not a black thing  It happens to be that in some poor countries  Where they don't have the education  This one  No, the vaccines in Africa

Yeah  That's a true story  I tried to do a joke about it  I was at the fucking STD clinic a lot  And they have a video  I was at the STD clinic  They have a video they play  And it's like a 20 minute video  About how AIDS is riddling the gay community
