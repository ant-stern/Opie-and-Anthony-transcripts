<pre> 1027 W&W, it's FU Friday with Opi and Anthony!  Hey!  Where's Anthony?  The fax is coming in like crazy.  If you want an FU on the pile, the fax line, 212-957-9639.  Just make it short and to the point so we can read as many of these as possible today, okay?  Absolutely.  Anthony, you want to explain FU Friday to all the brand new listeners?  We got a lot of them lately.  Do we?  I think so.  Maybe since we're an award-winning radio show.  Brand new listeners. 
[00:30]
 Well, FU Friday, it's your forum, your day, you've been pissed off all week.  Who pissed you off?  Your boss, husband, wife, whatever.  We give you a forum to bitch to our listeners.  You can hear it.  Yeah, our listeners can hear you bitching and you can bitch to them.  There you go.  Gives you a little outlet so you don't go postal.  And the easiest way is through the fax line, okay?  Can I start the festivities today? 
[01:00]
 Can I have the Daily News, Anthony, please, really fast?  Thanks.  Do you have an FU?  Oh, yeah.  FU to David Hinckley once again from the Daily News who writes the radio column.  Yeah.  Ann and I won the Aire Award for Best Afternoon Drawers Show yesterday.  I'm very proud of our award.  Honestly, we're a little embarrassed because I'm not going to lie to you,  the Aire Awards is kind of a joke.  It's pretty ridiculous.  But whatever, it's a good honor and we appreciate it.  So, page 132 of the Daily News today, David Hinckley runs down all the winners of the Aire Awards. 
[01:30]
 This just shows you what people think of you and I in this town as far as the rest of the media goes.  They have everyone listed in bold print, right?  Bold print, okay?  Like, you know, best morning show Elvis Duran in the zoo, okay?  Elvis Duran's name is in, you know, bold print, okay?  Yeah.  Lisa Taylor, best midday show.  Sharon Stevens, best weekend show, okay? 
[02:00]
 Everyone is in bold print, the winners, okay?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony of WVW, look at that.  We're the only one not in bold print.  Oh, yeah, you kind of pass it right over, don't you?  It's just his way of dissing us a little bit, whatever.  Have your fun.  Have your fun.  Can you believe that?  That's okay.  We're the scourge.  I love it.  We are the scourge of society.  Like, who cares?  All right.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, before we start the show today. 
[02:30]
 Too late.  I got to congratulate my fine sister.  What's going on there?  And her husband Mike, my sister Holly and Mike, pumped out another kid today.  Pretty fertile over there.  Well, my family is very fertile, Anthony.  I think we do so well in the ratings because my family, listen, keeps growing by leaps and bounds.  They have no choice.  They have to be faithful and listen to this radio show.  That alone gives us like a two share, I believe. 
[03:00]
 How was he dogging her when it all came together?  How do you think?  How do you think your little sister has taken it from behind?  Cut it out.  Shut up.  This is a proud and happy moment for my family and you're wrecking it.  Well, the egg was fertilized at some point.  I would rather not think about how my brother-in-law dogs my sister.  Thank you very much.  I think it was something done like a purpose to get pregnant or was it something maybe during the heat of passion and were they planning it? 
[03:30]
 Yes, they were.  Oh, so they were banging for a kid.  You son of a bitch.  So there's different positions that work better, I think.  We're going to have a fight club, you and I.  Was she doggy style?  Shut up.  Was she peering around over her shoulder looking at her ass?  This is supposed to be a happy and proud moment for my family.  I know.  I'm just saying.  You're not stupid.  You know how it's done.  People don't get pregnant by swallowing a watermelon seed. 
[04:00]
 Your sister was getting some of the big beef injection.  Idiot.  You know, you add an egg plus a little love snot.  What you get is a child.  Hey, douche.  Listen to me.  I'm stepping out of character today to show a little class.  I have to represent my whole family here today.  Most of my family are finding out for the first time that my lovely sister Holly and her husband Mike had a kid. 
[04:30]
 They don't like to describe it in that way.  I'm sorry about that.  I've got aunts and uncles and cousins all over the Tri-State area listening to you right now.  Anthony?  I'm really, really sorry about that.  I mean, we can be rude and crude right after I make this birth announcement, okay?  But I'm stepping out of character here to wish Holly and Mike...  Yeah.  Mike's the guy that's slamming her, right?  You saw that on the bed.  You know, she is very fertile.  Maybe he's just got a good technique.  Why do you think she's...  I hear like the ankles behind the ears. 
[05:00]
 Shut up!  Cut it out!  I can't have this.  Don't turn my mic off.  Come on.  We made a pact where we don't turn off each other's mics, but I can't have this today.  It's a very special day, you ask?  Okay, sorry.  My sister flew in from Florida.  Yeah?  Hasn't heard this radio show in a year.  She hasn't heard this? 
[05:30]
 All right.  I just assumed you knew how babies are made.  Yeah, I figured it out, Anthony.  You don't send a little letter to the stork and he brings a baby.  Someone's got to get a pounding by a member.  I understand.  That someone was your sister just getting slammed.  I know how babies are made because your mom taught me.  Now relax.  You're son of a bitch.  Sorry, I didn't know you'd get so upset. 
[06:00]
 All right.  Can I make the birth announcement?  Go right ahead.  I will shut up.  Congratulations to my sister Holly and Mike for having a bouncing baby girl.  A girl?  Jamie Lee.  All right.  Jamie Lee.  She can grow up and get that bang like a bomb.  Shut up!  Hey, Rick, stay out of it because I'll tell everyone what I did to your sister this morning. 
[06:30]
 Oh, my God.  Didn't you do something with her yesterday morning?  Yes, I did.  Wow.  Why are you bowing to him, you ass?  You know why they're bowing to me and you know why Rick is laughing because you usually dish this out.  I know.  I understand that.  I understand.  Go ahead, turn the microphones off.  No, all right.  Go ahead.  Have your fun.  Go ahead.  I won't turn off the lights.  Oh, my God. 
[07:00]
 Holy crap.  You better run.  You know, I wasn't going, man.  You better run.  You don't have your little cute little suit on today.  I'll kick you right in your nuts.  Dude, I'm not even going to waste my time with you.  If Spaz can beat you up, why should I bother?  He lost some fights too, tough guy.  Dude, Spaz beat you up.  That's all I have to say.  Spaz.  Spaz did twice as much as you, Rick.  He's 125 pounds soaking wet.  He beats you up.  He beats you up.  No. 
[07:30]
 Wow.  Opie obviously has very strong feelings for a family and his sister.  We have to stick together.  All right.  I'm done.  If you want to continue, I'm going to break out worst of CD number 35.  Oh, no.  And replay something we're not allowed to replay anymore.  Go ahead.  Let's see how brave you are.  Let me see what it is.  You know what it is.  I don't know what it is. 
[08:00]
 You want me to write it down?  Yeah, write it down.  Oh, that one.  Ow.  Yeah.  That'll leave a mark.  Do you want to continue?  Hey, you know, that's totally not fair.  Why?  Because that wasn't me saying let's not play that.  Right.  You know, that was my mom.  All right.  But you know, you are saying knock it off. 
[08:30]
 Now, if Holly called up and said that she was angry about what she was hearing.  Knowing my sister, she's mortified.  She doesn't even listen to our radio show.  Thank God.  She's the only one in my whole family that doesn't listen.  How could she find time to listen when she's getting banged by her husband?  Shut up!  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean that.  Rick, stop laughing.  Stop laughing.  Rick's just loving it.  Stop laughing. 
[09:00]
 Look at even Spaz is laughing.  Look at him.  Oh, how can you be upset?  You set him up with that one.  I was trying to have a nice moment.  I stepped out of character, wanted to give a birth announcement before we started the festivities today.  I understand.  I felt like sharing with everyone my joy and excitement that my family is feeling today.  Uncle open.  And you wrecked it.  I'm sorry.  You wrecked it.  I was taking your lead and the things I've heard you say in the past about other people and their relationships. 
[09:30]
 You've seen my brother-in-law, Mike.  He will kick your ass.  How would he find time while he's banging his sister?  Relax, Rick.  It's not that funny.  Oh, it is, Uncle.  Relax.  It's not that funny.  Ken, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  You know what?  You deserve every bit of a ban for what you did to Rick that time. 
[10:00]
 I got to tell you.  Why?  Rick beat the crap out of me after everything I said.  I could just picture it now.  Holly's there saying, Mike, throw your...  Oh, look at how he hangs up on him.  Wow, you are very defensive.  It's my sister.  No, I respect that.  That's good.  All right.  That's very nice.  Spaz, you want a beating?  Gary, what's up?  What's going on?  How are you guys doing?  You guys are killing me today.  All right.  Threatening Spaz. 
[10:30]
 Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's the matter, man?  We're doing Opie.  Opie thinks that his sister is our save, man.  I know.  I understand.  Opie.  Here we go.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Opie used to bend over and grab her ankles.  You guys wrecked it.  You know that they tape these birth announcements when one of my sisters or brothers has a kid?  Do they?  And then they play them every year and stuff.  This is what they're going to get to hear for the next 45 years. 
[11:00]
 Gee, I'm sorry I wrecked it like that.  Patricia, what's up?  You guys are so mean to him.  What?  You are so mean.  You guys are big-ass you to you guys.  Anthony, you're being so horrible right now.  How?  Well, what am I doing?  Oh, it's just so cruel.  Opie's trying to be like, sincere.  I mean, you're raking on his sister.  That's like, that's taboo. 
[11:30]
 Yeah, we don't rank on sisters around here.  Oh, yeah, right.  You're always talking about banging my sister.  I don't want to hear it.  Oh, and wait, did somebody call your sister a hoola?  A hoola.  I love it.  I love what they said.  There is only a small section of New York that you will ever hear whore said like that in the world.  I hear wha?  Somebody call her, I hear wha?  Where are you from?  Like, where the hell are you from?  Listen, I don't say whore. 
[12:00]
 I say whore or ho, baby.  Whore.  Where are you from?  I'm from New York.  Oh, South Shore?  Long Island.  No.  You really want to know?  Queens.  Oh, Queens?  Queens says who wha?  Queens says who wha.  I didn't know that one.  I left a story a long time ago.  Well, I wasn't from a story, but...  Now they say whore.  Now they say, now they say ho, ho.  Yeah, how do they say whore in Greek? 
[12:30]
 I don't know.  But, baby.  All right, well, thank you for sticking out for me.  Oh, Opie, I love you.  You guys are great.  All right.  Are you happy?  Uncle Ope.  You happy for my sister?  Yeah, of course.  Okay.  Jamie Lee, everyone, my sister.  I love that name.  My sister's new kid.  Jamie Lee.  You guys have a great weekend.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm waiting for one of my brothers to call to kick your ass because they're not going  to be as nice as I am.  I don't know.  That's just a little odd that you're so defensive. 
[13:00]
 Ken, what's up?  Hi, Uncle Ope.  Yeah.  Listen, you see, I don't understand.  You get the power and now you start hanging up on people?  See?  That's not right.  You believe him?  No.  You're hanging out to everybody.  Ann was hanging up on people.  No.  Come on.  You dish it out to everybody.  You should be able to take it once in a while.  I could take it, but I know my sister can't.  She's mortified right now.  But you know what?  And she'll call up.  Wait, well, Mike will call up.  And you'll tell him that's the deal just like we did with Anthony and his mother.  Oh, look at. 
[13:30]
 Oh, yeah, Ann.  Okay.  You know, I see what's going to happen today.  All right.  Obviously, Ann couldn't take your statement.  He had a dump out of it.  Okay.  I see where we are today, Ann.  But wait, isn't it an open forum?  Well, I thought until I saw it, I had reached for that button.  It is.  You see, if everybody else had a dump button, they wouldn't be listening.  That's why we're all listening.  All right.  And you know?  Thank you, Ken.  Take care.  All right.  Bye. 
[14:00]
 Lewis, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  All right.  Can you send Larry Gracie a system, my kid?  Oh, my goodness.  All right, look.  Look.  Cut it out.  All right.  Rick, cut it out.  You had fun.  You guys had 20 minutes of fun.  No, it's only been 12.  You've been keeping track, right?  Yeah.  Anyway, my sister had a kid today.  Thanks, Rick.  That's good.  Very nice.  Only 18 years till she's legal.  Okay.  All right.  I'm going to go ahead and send Larry Gracie a system. 
[14:30]
 All right.  Very nice.  Only 18 years till she's legal.  She's so annoying.  What?  Glad you said that, Larry.  F you, A-hole.  F you.  Look at you.  You psycho-mon just laughing in the other room.  F you, A-hole.  Come on, O-Pri.  18 years?  F you, A-hole.  I thought we were all having fun.  What happened?  Psycho-mon just laughed in the other room.  F you, A-hole. 
[15:00]
 What happened?  Psycho-mon coming in and going 18 years all excited.  Sorry, Mark.  You didn't have a boy.  Jesus, man.  This is getting really ugly.  Look at Stan.  Oh, man.  He stopped doing it.  I can't because of my eyes.  I have two more days left.  My eyes.  They're going crazy.  You can't do anything.  You're all right.  I'm going to go ahead and send Larry Gracie a system.  F you, A-hole.  F you, A-hole.  I thought we were all having fun.  I thought we were all having fun.  F you, A-hole.  F you, A-hole.  F you, A-hole.  F you, A-hole.  F you, A-hole.  F you, A-hole. 
[15:30]
 I swear to God, I can't do crap for two more days.  You can take him easy.  F you, A-hole.  Oh, my God.  Can we take a break?  Can we take a break?  Oh, yeah, sure.  All right.  Well, congrats.  Yes, congratulations.  I'm sending my congratulations.  Can I do this so at least they could play like maybe ten seconds of this tape.  Ten years from now?  you won't hear a word from me. 
[16:00]
 Don't laugh.  I won't even laugh.  Congratulations to my sister Holly  and her husband Mike  on their bouncing baby girl, Jamie Lee.  Okay?  Okay.  What are you getting ready over there?  Go ahead, play it.  I didn't say anything.  I said I wasn't going to say anything.  Alright, we'll be back with the program.  2127571027 if you want in.  Fax line 212-957-9639. 
[16:30]
 Opie.  If you keep your hands away from your pants.  Do I say hand?  Anthony.  I'm just a point of fact.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  It's FU Friday with Opie and Anthony on 1027-WNEW.  Hello.  Fax line 212-957-9639 if you want to get your FUs in today.  And of course you can do it live on the phone. 
[17:00]
 212-757-1027.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to give a big happy to Wilpon Darvus.  Why?  Why did you mention his name?  Because he was on, yesterday I was listening to him  and he was talking about you guys.  So?  So?  Everyone else is, why not him?  Everyone else is, right.  I don't know, I just think he's a douchebag.  Well, he's below us now.  We don't even acknowledge he exists.  It was fun, it was fun messing with him for what?  I think that battle took exactly two and a half hours to win. 
[17:30]
 So let him talk about us, whatever.  Alright guys, wonder what you know.  Alright.  See you later.  Surprised he has time to talk with all those 92 minute rock block.  92 minute rock block.  Yeah, rock.  That makes you feel good if you're a DJ and your boss tells you to play  92 minute rock blocks over and over again.  Yeah, really gives me an opportunity to tell my personality.  Yeah, well, 92 minute rock block.  The same crusty tunes we've been playing for the last eight months.  Have fun. 
[18:00]
 Anyway, Anthony.  On to other things.  Very happy day for my family, obviously.  Yes.  With my sister.  I'm leading to something here because we're going to move on to other things  with my sister having a daughter today, Jamie Lee.  Get out of here, a-hole.  We're done for now.  But Anthony, did you hear the big news?  Little Jamie Lee now. 
[18:30]
 It's okay.  It's okay.  Aww.  What?  I'm just playing baby, son.  That's all.  Alright.  You're not going to do anything over the top over there, are you?  No, because I have some limits on things I say, unlike some people around here.  Alright.  You sure?  Positive.  Okay.  I'm not going to insult your family's happy moment.  Anthony, did you read about Celine Dion in the paper today? 
[19:00]
 Yeah.  Everyone waiting for our comments on Celine Dion, it's being reported in the papers today  that she is pregnant with twins, Anthony.  Woo.  Now, one paper is saying that she's pregnant with twins.  The other is saying it's false, it's not true.  I would like to think that it is true and that Celine Dion is pregnant with twins.  Twins.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What, they freeze our husband's sperm or something? 
[19:30]
 Did you see that?  He has cancer, so they froze his sperm, and she was impregnated with her husband's frozen sperm.  Yeah, I guess because he kind of has cancer, but he can't just give her the high-hard one  and do it that way.  Well, they wanted to make sure they were going to have kids.  Right, with no good.  Well, that's something.  His sperm live on.  What in the world?  I am pregnant, finally. 
[20:00]
 We have been trying for so long to get pregnant, and finally my husband's sperm slammed into my egg.  Much like the mighty Titanic slammed that iceberg, splitting it open and fertilizing an egg  to make another Celine, hopefully.  Hopefully my legacy will live on, as will my camel toe. 
[20:30]
 It is such a happy moment for my 58-year-old husband, René,  when he found out I was pregnant with twins.  Do you know twin hippos could fit side by side in my camel toe?  But these are just twin babies.  All of the sperm that was swimming around in the icy waters of my uterus.  Do you know most of them die?  Most of the sperm never make it. 
[21:00]
 They die there in the icy waters of my uterus.  But two, two sperms lived on, swam, swimming, using all of their might to find the egg.  The egg to cling to.  These sperms are the ones that fertilize the eggs.  While the others died, these sperms were true survivors.  Do you know my twin children can grow to adulthood and still fit out of my camel toe? 
[21:30]
 That huge crevasse between my legs.  You should sing.  You should sing. 
[22:00]
 Do you know the reason it had to be artificial insemination?  I know why.  They say because René had cancer and they froze his sperm and put it in.  But the truth of the matter is he could not even feel the sides of my mighty camel toe.  I am so huge.  He kind of slammed it against the side a couple of times, but it did not work.  So they made a sperm popsicle.  Now this frozen sperm, was it as blue as the Caprio at the end of Titanic? 
[22:30]
 Yes, that's what they looked like, the sperm frozen like Leo at the end of Titanic.  My sperm will go on.  It was like having an ice pop in there, the frozen sperm of my husband René. 
[23:00]
 But I can have twins now.  And I will dress them in little jumpsuits to show off their tiny little camel toes.  Just like mommy.  My camel toe will live on.  My camel toe will go on.  My camel toe will go on. 
[23:30]
 Alright, it's a happy day for Celine and René.  Yes, congratulations Celine.  Twins.  Pregnant with twins.  Boy, it's got to be something for the OBGYN checking her out.  Alright, Celine hop up on the table.  Alright, why don't we take a look of, oh my.  Look at the size of that.  Let's just, oh, hello, echo.  Celine, wow, you got a lot of room in here. 
[24:00]
 Yeah, look at that.  You know, I don't even need instruments.  I'm just going to crawl right in, take a look around firsthand.  We don't need a sonogram or anything.  Wow, here deep inside Celine's womb.  Look at the size of this place.  Is anyone in here?  In here, in here, in here.  Fanocchio.  Fanocchio. 
[24:30]
 Burps, freezing in here.  It's like a Venus fly snack.  You got to watch out.  It'll scoop me right up.  Where the hell's the light switch in here?  It's pitch black.  Oh my God.  What's that, trout? 
[25:00]
 Just going to climb way up here.  Yeah, I could open up a water park in here.  People could just slide right back out.  Wherever you are.  I'm playing the snatch flute.  Wow.  Oh my God. 
[25:30]
 Oh my God, it's a T-Rex.  What the hell's that doing in here?  I'm just walking over here.  Oh my God, it's disgusting.  Who the hell's that sitting there?  Buddy Edson, what have you done in Celine's womb?  Oh my God, look, it's that little kitten boy from Jaws.  Wasn't a shark after all. 
[26:00]
 You're swimming, you got sucked up by Celine's shoes.  Hey.  There's another walk over here.  See who's in here.  Can we see your stuff?  Hey, how you doing?  All right, we're just going to go for a little pap smear here.  You might feel a little pressure.  There we go.  I've never gotten up to that. 
[26:30]
 Wherever you are.  I think.  All right, I've got to get out of here.  Oh my God.  This place is huge.  I told you that was coming right for us.  I don't even know what it was.  Better safe than sorry.  Oh, very good. 
[27:00]
 We've got to do a little volume.  I see a light.  Oh my God, it's a tractor trailer in Celine's womb.  Oh, there it is.  It's a little baby.  Look, it's a camel toe.  Can you walk out of her womb and step out of her pants, please? 
[27:30]
 I better get out of here.  I'm just coming out to be a hater here.  What's that about the one?  Oh, wait.  I feel much better.  Hey, I just want to get them.  Is that an Apache attack helicopter? 
[28:00]
 All right, well, there you have it.  Celine having a twin.  Congratulations.  Celine and her husband there.  Maybe that's where the CBS FM broadcast from.  Celine's womb.  With that, let's take a break.  We'll be back in just a bit here.  It's the Opie and Anthony show screwing off once again.  Absolutely on this fine FU Friday. 
[28:30]
 212-757-1027 is our phone number.  The fax line is 212-957-9639.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from her private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Phone line 212-757-1027.  It's FU Friday. 
[29:00]
 Hey, guys, I want to say a big FU to Sean Hannity  because he bashed you guys for winning the afternoon award show.  Really?  If he wants the award that bad,  we'll have spaz walk it over to the radio show.  Take it over.  Take a piece of masking tape over our names and you can write it up.  I'm just going to say it's no big honor.  If you really need it that bad, we'll walk it over to you right now.  Yeah. 
[29:30]
 All right.  Let's get to some FUs.  Brian, what's going on today?  Yeah, I was...  Well, I just walked my girlfriend and my best friend today in school.  I was in school and I was walking down the hallway  and I saw my girlfriend kicking my best friend.  So I ran over there and kicked his ass.  I wanted to give a big FU at my friend, actually my ex-friend now, Ryan.  So your best friend stole your girl and you beat the crap out of him. 
[30:00]
 Yeah.  It happens. It happens all the time.  Yeah, well, it was like that other guy who got beat up by the guy who stole the girl.  Right.  Very harsh.  All right.  All right.  All right. Thanks very much, guys.  Well, thanks for sharing.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, yeah, we got to talk about this guy.  Ken, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, did you watch Millionaire last night?  Rick was telling me. Rick, grab a mic.  I heard there was a guy in last night that lost... 
[30:30]
 First question.  First question.  First question.  The first questions are made for like kindergarten kids that are watching this show.  Yeah, there was a nursery rhyme.  The most pathetic look on the guy's face after he lost.  And you should see Regis.  What a stupid bastard, Gelmer.  I want to give you an F-word.  I can't believe it.  Well...  It was brown after that.  Well, Ken, explain what happened.  Well, it was...  You ever hear that little nursery rhyme?  Little Jack Horner sat in the corner.  Right.  Well, the answers were pulled out of plum, blackbirds, and two other ones. 
[31:00]
 So, I think that's the one who pulled out of plum is supposed to be the answer.  Right.  What did he pull out?  He pulled out blackbirds.  And he was confident on that.  Yeah.  The guy was like cocky and stuff.  He's like...  He goes, are you nervous?  He goes, oh, no, nobody's watching me, Regis.  Are you nervous?  They don't even comment on it.  They went right to commercial and they're like...  They didn't even say anything about it.  Oh, dude, dude, dude, dude, they did.  Didn't you watch Regis?  He was freaking out over it.  Regis was just like... 
[31:30]
 As soon as he heard the guy's answer say blackbird, Regis just pops his head up like a chicken  like, huh?  What?  And he starts pulling at his collar like...  And looking at the guy like, are you sure?  Are you positive?  That's your final answer.  He didn't even get to that part.  That's your final answer, you stupid buffoon.  What?  This kind of thing?  You're dumber than Kathy Lee.  And the guy was adamant about his answer.  What a jerk off.  He didn't win no money.  Zero.  He was certain it wasn't a plum. 
[32:00]
 He was certain.  And Regis afterwards, he goes, well, that's never happened before.  A first loser.  Loser?  I mean, didn't get the first question right.  Didn't get the first question right.  Did anybody get enough for this one?  On the $64,000 question, remember that one?  I will forge ahead to the $64,000 question.  And he's like, this is the first one?  Popular music.  His answer was Ed Norton. 
[32:30]
 Who wrote Swanee River?  Ed Norton.  Regis was all freaked out last night.  And the kid was young.  He was like 24.  So you know he's going back to his friends like, you loser.  Because it's just like he's just going to get pounded for years on that one.  Man.  Too funny.  I'm bummed I missed that one.  What an asswipe.  Regis was so surprised, man.  That's classic.  Kathy Lee.  Hello.  What's going on?  Hi.  I saw Stephen Lynch last night at Rassel's West Orange. 
[33:00]
 Funny guy.  Awesome show.  Yeah.  It was even better live than hearing him on the radio because he had the coolest facial  pressure.  Yeah.  I mean the whole act is great.  I mean we always recommend you guys go check out Stephen Lynch when he's in the area.  Yeah.  He was great.  Cool.  He plugged you guys a couple times too.  Well we definitely appreciate that.  We're all good buds around here.  How was the crowd?  Pretty good?  It was a little empty.  Not really empty but I don't know, really bad smell.  I sat two and a half hours traffic to get there. 
[33:30]
 Oh yeah.  It was a horrible night last night.  There was a couple tables empty but it was pretty full.  Cool.  It was a good crowd.  Well I'm glad you had a good time.  All right.  Thank you Kathy.  Thanks guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Larry you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Hey Larry you're up.  Hey it's me man.  Hey I was watching Regis last night and when he's after the guy who missed the answer he  goes, hey you know I was just thinking, I kept thinking about Blackbird and Regis goes,  you're done, you can't answer anymore. 
[34:00]
 You're finished you idiot.  What?  Idiot?  Oh the guy was just a buffoon.  He was like a kid, he was about 20 years old.  Kathy Lee's cans have a higher IQ than you.  Oh my gosh she was flawless this morning.  Really?  Oh that is just a scary sight.  You know I've been reading the stories in the paper and stuff but I never saw it for  myself until this morning.  Oh my gosh, yeah they're way down like that.  She still thinks she's like this young nubile chick and she's definitely up there in years 
[34:30]
 getting there.  You know she shouldn't be wearing no bra because those things are sagging.  And like they look like, like you say, socks filled with sand.  Philip tube socks full of sand and turning like sideways too.  Yeah man.  Man some kind of banana thing happening.  What the hell's going on in your dress Kathy Lee?  It's like you've got a couple of aliens coming out of your body.  Man I finally saw for myself that I could not believe what I was looking at.  Yeah.  No one is telling her that you're a little too old for this. 
[35:00]
 Who's going to tell her that?  She'll probably have you fired.  You walk up by Kathy Lee and just like tell you maybe you're a little, you know, maybe  you should wear something a little more flattering to your figure.  What do you mean?  Well your boobs are hanging like sweat socks full of sand.  Alright let's take a break.  We got to play Regis Goes Hollywood from the ONA archives and we'll be back soon.  I don't need that bitch anymore.  Whoa Regis.  I'm a popular man.  Regis what's up?  My new show Millionaire. 
[35:30]
 Yeah it's all over the paper.  I'm huge Gilman.  I don't have to sit next to that droopy canned bitch.  Regis you going Hollywood on us?  I've always been Hollywood.  It's the real Regis coming out.  You're bigger than ever these days.  I'm huge.  With that game show of yours.  Huge.  Huge yes.  Bring me coke horns.  Your lifestyle changing a little bit?  It's always been wild.  Yeah.  But now I don't have to hide it.  Yeah.  I used to go to Westbury Music Fair.  Yeah.  And sing and pick bimbos from the audience and bang them backstage. 
[36:00]
 You've seen the Motley Crue documentaries.  Yeah.  I send a Gilman out for bimbos.  Gilman there's a young girl of 50 or 60.  Pop your teeth out you whore.  Tongue it.  Tongue it.  I'll lick the geritol off your ass.  Gilman there's one in the front row.  Give her a heart monitor and send her back here.  I love old Gash. 
[36:30]
 Regis going Hollywood.  I love it.  Getting the groupies from the show.  I'm big now.  I'm getting ratings.  Yes you are.  That slut bad Cathy Lee I don't need her.  No you don't.  Bend her over that coffee table on the live show.  She's not wearing a bra these days though.  Those things would hit the floor.  I'll can effort.  Wow.  Come on.  That's the question on tomorrow's Millennium 2000 trivia question.  We do every morning.  Where am I going to have Cathy Lee?  Right in the cans.  You see those things? 
[37:00]
 I could do that in my entire life or not.  Tomorrow's guest Dirty Sanchez on the show.  Is that a Christian musical group or something?  No it's the Dirty Sanchez.  It's the Dirty Sanchez.  Make Cathy Lee look like the Frito Bandita.  Hor!  Bury it deep you hor! 
[37:30]
 No wonder we have no ladies listening to our show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Throne men jumping all over each other.  Okay terrific.  107-7-7-U-N-E-W.  107-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's FU Friday.  212757-1027 is our phone number.  Let's go right back to the phones and talk to Mike.  Mike what's going on today?  Hey what's up man?  I was watching TRL and there's some guy trying to copy Psycho Mark. 
[38:00]
 What is he doing?  He's got the orange sign.  He's got a sign.  He's doing a poor, poor, it's an orange sign with like very thin, he wrote wow on it.  Oh cool.  He's trying to do it right now.  And he's like jumping up.  He's doing a very down to Psycho Mark and he's jumping like crazy.  Oh really?  Yup.  And there's like this five people behind him.  Well that's what we're looking for.  We're looking for other people to take the lead that Mark has put out there.  We're looking for, what was the word? 
[38:30]
 Mutations of Psycho Mark.  Clones.  Not even clones like the spawn.  Yeah we want, yeah Psycho Mark spawns.  To you know just flash wow signs anytime you see a live TV shot going on.  Yeah.  And where is the guy?  Is he in the street and stuff?  Yeah he's in the street.  He's right behind there's this girl, the brat that's hosting it.  And he's right behind them on the left.  Oh cool.  He's jumping like crazy.  Yeah put it on.  Alright we'll check it out for ourselves.  There's like, there's people helping him jumping out with him too. 
[39:00]
 So he's got like eight people with him.  He's got a big crowd.  Ah right on.  This is what we want to see.  We want to take over the city.  Every time they do a live show we want someone behind the news person you know with a wow  sign or something that has to do with the radio show.  Yeah.  See you don't need to read up yet.  You got the crowd.  There you go.  Alright man.  Alright thank you.  You guys suck.  Alright man we got him.  Is that him?  No.  We don't see anyone behind her right now.  This would be really cool if people are taking Psycho Mark's lead though. 
[39:30]
 Yeah.  We had a hell of a week I gotta say.  I mean we forgot that Psycho Mark was all over MTV this week.  Yeah.  With the wow sign.  Like crazy.  This clips up on the unofficial Opien Anthony website.  And we were talking to Psycho Mark in our office.  He's got something planned that is just going to be the atom bomb.  Oh yeah yeah.  I don't even know if we can take credit for this when it happens.  Is it your idea? 
[40:00]
 Yeah we were talking about it last night.  Don't even say what it is because it's going to be a complete surprise to everyone when  it happens.  But that was your idea?  Yeah.  Oh my god.  It is an atom bomb isn't it?  If it happens, and we're not going to say when or where, would you just laugh until you  vomited if you saw that?  I think officially it would be the funniest thing I've ever ever seen on TV.  Absolutely.  Without a doubt.  Yeah. 
[40:30]
 Without a doubt.  That's all we can say.  But we can't tell you when or where it's going to happen.  But if he pulls this off, and let me tell you something.  It's very very possible he will pull this off.  Oh hell yeah.  And if he does, it will be a huge national story.  Huge.  I mean it will be bigger than big.  Yeah that's all we can really say.  And I think we'll be on the big station.  Yeah right.  That's why we can't acknowledge that we had anything to do with it. 
[41:00]
 No.  Who are we?  It's just somebody out there with a sign.  It's a brilliant idea.  I wish we could say something now but we would wreck it.  Yeah.  We would definitely wreck it.  Yeah.  But if he pulls this off, holy crap.  Joe what's going on?  Yeah how you doing Uncle Opie?  Congratulations there.  Hey thank you.  Hey yeah you guys see that clip of Rick and Mark with the old suit on, the cushioned suit  on?  Yeah.  On Found Your Music.com there?  Yeah we were talking about that yesterday. 
[41:30]
 It was going on in the studio.  Oh it was hilarious man.  I thought when he threw Mark against the record rack right there, I thought all the CDs were  going to come down.  It was so funny man.  It was something that was going on while we were doing our radio show that we never even  commented on.  But Psycho Mark was in riot gear and Rick was beating the crap out of them.  Yeah it was funny.  Throwing them into the CD rack and jumping on top of them and it's on the unofficial  website.  It was great guys.  Cool.  Keep it up man.  Where else do you want to go? 
[42:00]
 Oh yeah we'll go there in a sec.  Len what's going on?  Did any of you guys see this early edition this morning?  No.  They were doing a piece about teen movie stars and how they're in all the different movies  and they cut through a clip of Freddie Prinze Jr. hosting CRL and they had, all you see  is what's it say, Psycho Mark dancing in the background.  With the wow sign right?  If anyone saw it this morning just ask so they can verify it.  That's hilarious.  That's beautiful.  Alright later guys.  Thank you Len. 
[42:30]
 Too funny.  People want to guess what Mark will do.  This is dangerous because we want this one to happen.  We share everything with you guys.  We share too much because half the time I'll open my stupid mouth and a bunch of things  haven't happened because I spoke too soon.  That's the only reason why we can't tell you yet.  John what's up?  John?  Yeah?  You want to guess what Mark's going to do?  Yeah.  Alright go ahead.  Are you going to moon the camera?  It's much bigger than that.  Much bigger than that? 
[43:00]
 That's all I'm going to say.  I've got to hang up okay?  Did you guys lose your job over it?  No.  Ah come on.  I don't think so.  You guys are great.  Take it easy.  It depends what TV station he chooses.  Yeah.  But I'm guaranteeing it will be huger than huge.  When is he going to try to pull this off you think?  I don't know.  We ought to do it soon though.  It's got to be bigger than the wow.  You know what I mean?  Um yeah. 
[43:30]
 Like twice the size.  Yeah.  Black on white.  Yeah.  It will horrify people.  Oh my god.  It will absolutely horrify people.  I can't believe you thought of that one Ed.  Oh yeah.  It's great.  It's definitely great.  Gabe you're next.  What's going on?  Nothing much.  Alright.  Hey I want to give a big FU to someone.  Yeah go ahead.  FU to that damn Cuban kid.  I hate him. 
[44:00]
 The Raph boy?  Yeah I hate him.  He's very popular.  His grandparents are coming over now.  Take him away.  I think we should just send him back.  Exactly.  It's a big deal.  He's hitting the ass.  I feel sorry for him though.  Because a year from now he's going to be all screwed up in the head.  I feel sorry for him because they don't really care about his uh you know the feelings of  the kid.  It's just a whole political mess is what it has become.  Yeah it's Cuba against the United States.  Right.  Learn about Cuba.  Eating some food.  Hey the ironic thing is my last name is Castro. 
[44:30]
 Oh really?  Yeah.  No kidding.  You're coming?  You got a big beard?  Yeah I do.  Yeah?  I'm part of a snitch.  Alright too much information Gabe.  That's funny.  Thank you.  No problem.  Alright everyone is guessing what Mark's going to do.  It's pretty funny.  I'll just read them instead of going to the phones.  Mark on TV naked with wow sign.  Will Mark run on the field of the Super Bowl?  Anything is possible that's all we'll say okay?  Yeah.  Alright we got to play this for Raph.  Raph Boy and we'll be back.

Drown drown drown drown.  Drown drown drown drown drown.  Drown drown drown drown drown.  Drown drown drown drown drown.  arrows shooting Grondon

 Grondon now  ad 한  ad  publicly  it  june  on your radio.  Rick is handing me a fax from Kim. 
[47:00]
 Please send an FU to my husband Tom because his sperm was too retarded to find my egg  last month.  Too retarded.  That's great.  I'm not pregnant.  Hopefully this month's batch will have enough intelligence to find the egg.  I also want to say happy fifth anniversary to my husband.  His retarded sperm.  His retarded sperm couldn't find Kim's egg this month.  How many millions of those things?  What are millions, right?  Yes.  Every sperm is sacred, Anthony.  Aren't there ones that fight the other ones and they got the real strong one, smart one 
[47:30]
 and they're just swimming?  Right.  Kicking ass?  Sure.  Bouncing each other out of the way?  Sure.  And then all of a sudden right up the middle.  Like the other one is duking it out.  Only to be knocked into the side of the womb.  Slow and steady with the floor. 
[48:00]
 Before you know it, a couple of years later you're like, die baby.  What happened?  Quick physical break there.  Corn falling away from issues.  Boom man, before that.  It's FU Friday.  The facts keep rolling in here.  Yeah.  212-957-9639. 
[48:30]
 I don't know who sent this in but it's a great one.  Hey guys, here's a tidbit on how stupid the news is.  I was watching Fox News last night.  Their top story was the Seton Hall fire.  So they say coming up more info on the Seton Hall fire  plus an exclusive interview with a student who slept through the whole ordeal.  Hello, can you imagine this interview?  Reporter.  So can you tell us what happened?  Student.  Well I didn't really see much.  I was sleeping at the time.  Reporter, you heard it first year. 
[49:00]
 Back to you in the studio.  Wow, what an exclusive.  I had to turn off the TV.  Later Chris.  Could you ask him if he was asleep on his back or his stomach?  Yes, very good question.  The studio wants to know.  I love that when they do that follow up question.  The guy has to put his finger in his ear by a little ear funding to hear the studio.  Yes, yes.  Okay, yes, I will ask him that.  Right.  Shut up.  We passed on the kid that slept through the Seton Hall fire. 
[49:30]
 We could have had him on our show but...  Thank you.  What are you going to ask him?  I made the perfect point.  How much weed did you smoke?  How much bourbon did you drink before?  I don't know, it was some kind of frat thing.  I had that laser eye surgery so I popped a few Valiums and slept through the whole damn thing.  It's the news.  They have to get their own unique angle on everything.  No one is even worse than that and every station did it last night.  The snow coverage. 
[50:00]
 Holy cow, we are not retards out here when we are watching TV.  Did anyone call it Snowstorm 2000 yet?  Blizzard 2000.  See, I'm waiting for the Blizzard 2000.  Nor'easter 2000.  Blizzard of the Millennium.  You know what it sucks now?  They can't call anything of the century yet because it's like the beginning.  I know.  Like now it was like the OJ trial, Trial of the Century.  All right, it's pretty close to the end. 
[50:30]
 Yeah, pretty good odds no one was going to beat that one.  No one was going to beat that one.  Okay, now it's like Blizzard of the Century.  It's OO.  All right?  You're making a pretty big statement that in the next 99 years this is not going to be something worse.  Yeah, but I mean if the TV stations are listening, we're not retards.  We don't go to work on the short bus with hockey helmets.  You know something that's supposed to snow in January, supposed to be very cold.  They asked one guy how he was driving in the snow. 
[51:00]
 How are you driving in the snow?  What do you mean how am I driving in the snow?  I thought today was a great day to see how fast my car could go.  Driving maybe a little slower?  And then obviously gives the answer, well I'm taking a little extra caution out here,  a little slippery, not going as fast, blah, blah, blah.  We here at the station recommend you take a little extra time getting where you have to  and don't drive unless you have to. 
[51:30]
 Right.  So those aimless wanderings about the streets in your car, count those out.  Don't drive unless you have to.  Isn't that when you drive anyway?  You know, I'm going to drive.  I don't have to, but I'm going to.  Just because I want to.  What a bunch of jerks.  Have you checked any elderly lately?  Well, better than that.  And we suggest that you don't leave your pets outside.  It's going to be two degrees tonight.  Oh gee, thanks for that one. 
[52:00]
 Huh, was going to let little Fluffy out.  I thought he liked the fridge and cold.  Let's go douse him in water and throw him outside.  Make a little stiff, little Fluffy sickle.  Every year.  Every year.  Same thing.  My new apartment is a little cold.  And then they go to the hardware store and they show you that there's no more snow shovels.  Everyone bought it for the big store.  And snow blowers? Forget about it.  All sold out here.  They were interviewing an older guy from Jersey who was snow blowing his driveway. 
[52:30]
 It was hilarious.  Really?  How are you handling this?  Well, the snow blower is doing the job for me.  Yeah, pretty good.  Makes me feel young.  How are you doing today?  Pretty good. I've got a compressor sounding.  Snow blower?  Give me a snow blower sound, Rick.  My new apartment there, it's a little cold, a little concerned.  Went down to the landlord. 
[53:00]
 Welcome to New York.  You think you're special?  No, I know.  He never works in New York.  In the winter.  They're kind of the old type radiators, you know?  In each room, the metal radiators.  And, oh my God, at night, here it is.  I didn't know we were having the guy from police academy in today. 
[53:30]
 Thank you.  Yes, it's me now.  I'm just surprised you're so cold with all the effing you're doing lately.  Yeah, yeah, baby.  The only thing that protects me from the cold.  You know, nice warm body next to you.  That'll help.  What's his name?  Yeah, that's right, Rick.  Again, didn't even bother.  What?  You didn't even bother with the you got me. 
[54:00]
 It was just like, whatever.  Mike, what's going on?  Mike?  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  All right.  I just wanted to chime in on what you're talking about, Andy, in terms of the recycled stories.  You know, when I was growing up out of Long Island, it was just effing cold.  There was no windchill.  There was no ambient temperature.  You're absolutely right.  I mean, these guys, it is the exact same story from last winter.  They got to come up with new stuff.  That's why they come up with like dew points and ambient temperature and wind chills and stuff like that. 
[54:30]
 You know, it's good.  It's five degrees outside.  Or actually, yeah, it's 19 degrees on the thermometer.  But with the wind, it's going to feel like it's 10 below.  Well, what is it?  It doesn't matter.  I'm still freezing my ass off.  I don't care what you call it.  It'll feel like it will.  Do you think that when all the snow melts, we'll have a chance to solve our drought problem?  Mike, the funny thing too is, why did the TV stations even bother going out to get new footage every winter? 
[55:00]
 Why don't you use the same footage and just update it every 10 years so the cars don't...  Or when it was snowing last week and it didn't, they ran all those January 96 videotapes.  Yeah.  It's not what it could've looked like, but it did.  They could just run old footage from New York and say, why are the license plates orange?  How about Penny Cronk in front of 800 pounds of sand?  I'm down here at the sand dunes.  Yeah, yeah, down here where the sanitation department is loading up sand to spread on the streets.  And then they have like these individuals performing.  What are you going to be doing? 
[55:30]
 Well, we've got all the trucks out tonight.  We've got them all out.  They're all out there, you know, putting sand on the road.  Really?  I'd love to talk to you some more, but I've got to go check the ambient temperature outside.  You heard it here, putting sand on the road.  Back to you in the studio.  Well, thank goodness for them.  Vinnie, you're next. What's up?  Yeah, this morning, good to New York. They closed the Big Chill 2000.  Big Chill 2000? It's winter. It's not a Big Chill 2000. 
[56:00]
 No, I mean, everything's, you know, it's new to everybody.  Snow, cold, you know?  I don't know about you, but snow's not new to me anymore.  I've been through it a few times.  Jesus Christ.  All right, thank you, Vinnie.  All right, got to go back to work.  Bye.  Unbelievable.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, buddy, what's going on?  Not much.  Listen, he's got a big F.U. out for these people.  If you can't drive in bad weather in this year, then he's driving you crazy.  It's not even bad weather.  Yeah, just a couple of little snow in the heart. 
[56:30]
 Scott, call back. Your phone sucks. Sorry about that.  Let's go to Jimmy. Jimmy, you're a cop?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Hello?  Hey, you're on, man. You're on, Jimmy.  Jimmy, don't listen to the radio.  I got some guy holding himself hostage in a room here in Astoria.  And all those cops are freezing trying to clear the area.  Get out of here. 
[57:00]
 Are you serious?  Serious.  He's holding himself hostage?  Yes.  And you're a guy holding himself hostage in Astoria.  One more step and the nigger gets it.  Remember that from Blazing Saddles?  Cleavon Little holding a gun to his head. Remember that scene?  Go do what he says. Do what he says.  This is there it comes.  That poor man, somebody save him. 
[57:30]
 Doug, what's up?  We've got to play the Blazing Saddles clips again.  We got a lot of trouble last time we did that.  Doug, what's up?  I saw a report of these guys.  Remember that snowstorm back there?  The big one in Three Feet, whatever we had that time?  Yeah.  They ran out of something to run.  So they had this pinhead out there scraping ice off the van.  They're like, look, this is what you're doing.  They're banging the hood of the truck,  hitting the crap out of it, trying to get the ice off.  I just want to jump through the TV and stab this person right in the eye. 
[58:00]
 They were pretty much telling us how to scrape ice.  That's good. Thank you.  They're out of control.  All right, man. Thank you.  See you later, guys. Bye.  They've run out of ways to talk about the winter weather.  That's what it is. Every year it's the same thing.  But you need a real storm to even talk about it.  I'm sure we will have Blizzard 2000, whether it's a blizzard or not.  I think if we would have gotten like another inch of snow,  they would have called it Blizzard 2000.  They would have pulled out the Blizzard 2000 graphic? 
[58:30]
 Oh, pull the new shiny 2000 graphic with snow blowing on it, you know?  Yeah.  Top story tonight, Blizzard 2000, sucking in New York.  We go now to the talking head we put at Kennedy Airport,  talking with the runway crews, how they're keeping the runways clear.  Oh, too funny.  All right, let's take a break.  Oh, I wanted to talk to Dan. 
[59:00]
 Where's Dan? Oh, no problem.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, I went to the Knick game on Monday.  Yeah.  And Star Jones was sitting courtside.  How many seats did she take up?  Well, she had Julianne Moore on one side, you know, the actress.  Sure.  And a little girl on the other side. You could barely see them.  They had no chance of seeing the game.  She's a diva, though. She's a diva.  Oh, they were creating their next round to try to see the court,  and they just had no chance.  Imagine you have like courtside seats to the Knicks game, or one seat back. 
[59:30]
 Yeah, I was going to say second row.  You have second row seats.  You're so psyched driving in, you're like,  I can't believe I got second row to the Knicks game.  You sit down, it's great, the game's ready to start.  All of a sudden, oh, you see a little commotion.  People are going, oh, look, maybe a celebrity's coming.  Right.  Maybe it's Spike Lee or something.  I'll get to see a scene be made right in front of me.  Maybe it's a big celebrity that I'm going to say, 
[60:00]
 oh, my God, it's Star Jones.  She's like walking onto the court.  And Klopp's a fat ass right in front of you.  No.  A little girl to her right, it was just a dwarf.  You could barely see her.  Now you can't see anything.  Big, like the Knicks score and she jumps up  and her arm's fat is in your way, just flabbing.  Did you see the size of her arms in the Daily News the other day? 
[60:30]
 Yeah, they had a great picture of it.  Oh, my God, it looked like the...  Her arms are bigger than my thigh, easily.  It was like more meat on there than that big thing  they put on Fred Flintstone's car that tips it over.  That's what it looked like, a big chunk of like a Bronto burger.  That's what it was, her huge arm.  And that was just an arm.  Like her whole body's like that.  And then she goes on that show, The View,  and she's calling herself a diva.  They have star beauty tips where she dresses in this, 
[61:00]
 I swear I saw this, a black satin robe.  And she's laying on these satin sheets with candles on a bed  talking about how Star Jones does her diva beauty tip  looking like Shamu.  She's all like in this black satin robe.  I swear to God, first thing I like to do is knock a little seal around  with my tail, I'll wrap it around the bed, and fly it into my mouth.  Well, you know, we sit pretty high up.  You usually need binoculars to figure out what celebrity's 
[61:30]
 sitting down there.  You didn't need them for that game.  You knew who she was right off the bat.  It was either Star Jones or a rerun from what's happening.  I couldn't figure out who it was.  All right, Dan.  Okay, thanks.  Thank you.  And they all kiss her ass on that show.  You know, oh, Star was on the cover of Big Beautiful Women.  They're scared she's going to eat them.  This month, yeah.  She was on the cover and look at this, huh?  And the audience is, woo, they're all clapping. 
[62:00]
 Look at what a beautiful diva she is.  Well, honey, and then she tries a little humor against herself.  She's like, well, they touched this up a little bit.  I mean, what they do is airbrush out my freckles,  the ones I didn't get with the spackle I apply in the morning.  And of course, I'm wearing the special Star Jones diva wig  because I got a crew cut under here.  I must be beautiful when I rip my clothes off in front of my man 
[62:30]
 and I have to take my hair off.  Star Jones.  Yes.  They're in the view. Star Jones comes cruising.  A thousand men into the water, ten men out.  Star Jones took the risk.  Look at that porker. Look at the size of that porker.  You're going to go in that cage.  The cage goes in the water. Star Jones in the water.  Farewell and adieu to your fair Spanish lady. 
[63:00]
 You saw Star Jones in a rocking chair once.  Swallow your hole. Little tenderizing, down you go.  Hey, Quince, would you like to go into Star Jones' gash?  Hooper?  Hooper, aren't you watching it?  Star Jones can't go down with three barrels in her. 
[63:30]
 Hello.  Ah!  Like Star Jones gets up on the back of her Quince coat  and Quince slides into her snatch.  Ah!  Blood coming out of her mouth.  I'll never learn a life jacket again.  On CBS.  Yeah, a lot of folks coming in for that as Bit of the Week, the CBS FM bit. 
[64:00]
 Cool.  You can still vote for Bit of the Week.  I don't know, what do you want to do with the whole rock thing from yesterday?  A lot of people saying that we came off looking really bad.  A lot of people sending in hate email about that.  Why?  A bunch of other people applauding us for us, you know, standing our ground  and not letting them into the show yesterday, but I mean, it is cringe radio at its best.  And I think The Rock came across looking very, very good  after the whole mess that was yesterday's show. 
[64:30]
 He's a company guy, you know, in the best interest of the company.  It was good for him to come up here and talk like a gentleman  and apologize to people that promote the product, which is what we did.  He did explain himself.  I mean, a lot of people want to hear it again.  We shan't plug that organization again.  Well, do we want to replay it though?  I mean, it's good for our radio show.  We could do that, yeah, but it's not like we're plugging them or anything. 
[65:00]
 All right, could you get that?  How long do you need?  Like 15 minutes.  Why?  No edits?  No, we don't need edits.  Yeah, no problem.  We don't have to clean it up.  All right, yeah.  So we'll do that very soon and more of your phone calls, 212-757-1027.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony afternoon.  Mason and Kalinsky morning.  The Radio Chick Mythic on 1027 WNEW. 
[65:30]
 Hey, Anthony.  Yes.  We got to welcome a brand new client to the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Listen to the excitement in my voice for this live read.  I can only imagine who it is by the excitement in your voice, Opie.  Got to welcome Diamond Vision and, of course, Dr. Philotoff to the Opie and Anthony radio show.  This guy is like...  He is a god in my eyes.  Amazing.  Opie had the procedure done.  I had LASEC, LASEC, what?  LASETEC, LASEC, LASEC surgery. 
[66:00]
 Yes, you had LASEC surgery.  Yes, I'm so excited.  I forgot what the procedure was called.  I apologize, Dr. Philotoff.  Yes, and all, you know something?  Opie doesn't even have to know the name.  All he knows is he can see.  It's a modern day miracle.  I mean, people are sick of me talking about how good my eyesight is now.  Yeah.  I mean, when we were walking around the city the other night, I could not believe that the average person sees like this. 
[66:30]
 He's walking around now just craning his neck trying to see everything, everything he hasn't seen in years.  He smashed his glasses.  Yeah, I smashed the glasses on Monday, glasses that are so freaking important to me.  It's not even funny.  It's not even funny.  I wore glasses since I was in the third grade.  Glasses to me is like Viagra to like Hugh Hefner.  You know what I mean?  He's not leaving the house without his Viagra.  Okay, that's how I was with my glasses.  You're going to think down if you didn't have your glasses. 
[67:00]
 Monday I came in here, two days after the procedure, I'm seeing 2015.  Better than 2020.  Better than 2020.  I smashed my glasses on the air and I haven't looked back.  I had the surgery, what, Ed? Six days ago?  Yeah.  No one could tell I had the surgery.  I don't even feel like I had the surgery.  There's no pain.  There's nothing.  I think it's weird even calling it surgery.  It's a procedure.  You know, because it doesn't even seem like that.  I procedure.  You came in, I saw you two days after and you're like, look at my eyes. 
[67:30]
 Look at my, you maybe get like an inch from your eye.  And that was frightened.  Yeah, I know.  We usually don't do that.  No, we don't usually get that close.  Unless we're really, really drunk.  I looked right into your eyeball.  You are disgusting, man.  I looked right into your eyeball and didn't see any different than I saw for years.  Highly recommend this.  I was looking out our office window, reading signs like that were a couple blocks away.  I'm looking at, you know, water towers on the top of the buildings.  He's amazed.  I almost got in an accident driving into work because I had to see the skyline for the first time in detail. 
[68:00]
 I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  And I had no problems with my night vision whatsoever.  My night vision sucked before the procedure sucked.  And remember how scared I was a week ago?  You were petrified.  Absolutely petrified because I've been looking into the surgery for about a year.  Looked into a bunch of doctors and Dr.  Philotoff made me feel very, very, very comfortable.  I went up there.  He has like three offices in Greenwich, Connecticut, Westport, Connecticut and here in Manhattan. 
[68:30]
 Talked to him.  By the time he talked me in, I was ready to go.  And matter of fact, during the procedure, I was mellow talking to him like it was no freaking big deal.  How about that?  Now you see fine.  You see better than people without glasses.  I'm like John Travolta.  Yeah.  Boy in the plastic bubble.  You finally got let out.  Remember when John got out of the bubble and enjoyed that day with his girlfriend and stuff?  Yes.  That's how I feel every day now.  It's like a whole freaking new world out there. 
[69:00]
 I swear to God.  Boy in the plastic bubble.  I swear though.  I'm very excited that they decided to advertise on our show because I'm very, very, very happy with this.  Okay.  Very good.  It's Diamond Vision with Dr. Philotoff.  The phone number 1-800-984-2020.  Very easy number to remember.  1-800-984-2020 for Diamond Vision and Dr. Philotoff.  If you need that number, don't hesitate.  Please email me or give us a call here at the station.  Okay?  Right. 
[69:30]
 1-800-984-2020.  27-WAW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's FU Friday.  Having a lot of fun today.  Yeah, yeah.  Lots going on.  If you want to get in, we are taking your votes for Bit of the Week.  Looks like the CBS bit is in the lead right now, but a lot of fun and interesting things have happened on the show this week.  So if you want to get involved with that, that's very cool.  We like when you guys get involved with the radio show.  Oh yeah.  You can send your FUs in through the fax line, 212-957-9639. 
[70:00]
 That's very good, right?  Sure.  And I don't know.  We're going to replay The Rock's visit from yesterday.  Before the end of the hour, hopefully.  Or right around 5.  As soon as Rick gets it together, it's going to take him a couple minutes.  I guess all the wrestling websites are talking about it and stuff.  Yeah, big news, of course.  And I don't know.  You know, a lot of people think we're dicks for what we did yesterday. 
[70:30]
 And a lot of other people think it was cool that we stood up for something we believed in.  And you could decide for yourself.  Either way, whatever.  I thought The Rock came across pretty good actually yesterday.  Sounded like a gentleman, you know.  Could be just the corporate line that he was supposed to take.  Could be.  We don't know.  Yeah.  I accept his apology.  I accept his explanation that he gave yesterday.  I appreciate that he did that for us.  Not going to lie.  Yeah. 
[71:00]
 What the hell was that?  What have you got there, Mark?  Oh, it's Robin.  Don't you have work to do?  Yeah, don't you have a spot to produce or something instead of walking around with a stern wig on?  Pathetic man.  Alright, go away.  Graham, what's up?  Yeah, what's up guys?  How are you doing? 
[71:30]
 I'd just like to congratulate you guys on standing up for The Rock.  I think he's a piece of garbage and you really showed him what's what.  Happy that they didn't understand what was going on.  Well, I don't think it was about us showing him anything.  It was just, you know, stating our case and he stated his case.  And then we didn't allow him into the studio.  But that was hilarious, man.  Alright, cool.  Well, we appreciate it.  Alright guys, keep going.  Alright.  Love you, bye.  And we'll replay that and that's it for a while with the WWF. 
[72:00]
 Yeah.  Right.  That's it.  Okay, listen.  I don't know if you've seen the audio yet, but it's all over CNN.  Mike Tyson's over there.  Is he fighting again this weekend?  I've lost track of Tyson.  I guess he's in England fighting.  Trying to get his boxing career on track again.  And the people just thrilled to have him.  Yeah.  They can't stand him.  They're outside his hotel just protesting saying that they should throw Mike Tyson out of England. 
[72:30]
 Mostly the women's groups, Anthony.  The women hate him.  The women hate him over there.  They don't appreciate what he's done to women over here in our country.  So they feel that he doesn't belong in their country.  He was put in prison for rape.  Rapping a woman.  And then there were allegations by his girlfriends and ex-wives about abuse.  All kinds of stuff.  He should have to go back to prison for marrying the lady he's with now.  Oh my God. 
[73:00]
 Ooh.  That's not funny.  What are you talking about?  So on CNN they got footage of Mike Tyson.  I guess the protesting has gotten so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police station  because they're just protesting wherever he goes.  So he's out this window at the police station with a megaphone trying to talk to the lady protesters.  That's what you want him to do.  Like talk to the protesters. 
[73:30]
 That won't piss them off any more than they already are, right?  Oh, I'm sure.  Hey, you lying me bitches.  Any of you lying me bitches won't come in here and see who could take a punch like Robin Givens.  Come here you bitches.  Come on, kick your ass.  Come here, you're the first one.  Look at you, you toothless bitch.  Come here.  Shall we shag?  Thanks, Rick. 
[74:00]
 I had it all set up.  Rick, eff me up.  Rick, get up.  Get away from me.  Go get up.  You make me sick.  I got everything already pushed.  Hey, Rick, get out of my face.  I'll punch you.  Look, Rick, yeah, you scream like a bitch, Rick, don't you?  You scream like a lying bitch.  Come here, you pasty white English whore.  Why are they so angry at me?  Why are they angry? 
[74:30]
 Because your queen is a twat.  Come here.  Oh, look, look, this is the queen.  Come here, queen.  Come on, body blow.  You can't even take a punch.  You like Spinks.  You like Spinks.  I came out of the corner and pounded him.  Now I'm going to bend the queen over a chair and do her in the caboose.  Just like I did to that Miss USA or whatever the hell it was, I banged. 
[75:00]
 I went to prison for that.  I went to man in prison.  Prison.  I don't sound like the man dog.  Rick, I'm going to make you look like Lady Di after I'm done with you.  You're going to be bleeding.  You can rest assured.  Where's Prince Charles?  I'm going to bang you in your big ears.  Okay, here's a fine lady.  Now I want to talk sense to you. 
[75:30]
 I have been rehabilitated.  I went to prison.  I'm just trying to get my fighting career back.  They don't look at me like that.  What would I do?  I don't even understand.  I'm like an animal.  He's like the Beatles over there.  They're chasing him around.  Yeah, but they want to kill me.  They don't want like a water graver or nothing.  They want to kill me.  Thank God there aren't too much pushies that have guns over here. 
[76:00]
 Even the police don't have them.  Look, here's one of them Bobbies with that big stupid hat.  Look, I'm kicking his ass.  I'm like King Kong.  I'm just running around.  Remember that King Kong movie?  It was in New York and it couldn't do nothing.  That's me in England.  The cops don't have guns so I could run rampant.  Come here, you bastard.  Look, I'm beating up the police.  They're throwing soccer balls at you, Mike?  Yeah, soccer balls. 
[76:30]
 That's all they got.  Look, I'm like a big guard booth in front of the palace  and they got them guards with the big fuzzy hats on.  You can't make them change the expression on their face.  Watch this.  See his expression now?  Now look at this.  Look, now it's a bloody expression.  I made a change.  Now I'm going to take that furry hat and stick it in your keister.  That's only to make room for my giant member. 
[77:00]
 Look, it's Prince William.  Look at that fine young little ass.  I'm going to be himself and abuse him.  I love England.  We're the Spice Girls.  I'm going to skewer them like a shish kebab.  I'll get all of them on there once.  Come here, you whores.  Come here, you limey whores.  You all got bad teeth. 
[77:30]
 Your teeth, they suck.  You got the scurvy.  I got a cure for that.  Yeah, that's the cure.  You look at it, bitch.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you ain't never seen nothing.  Where's your grand?  Come here, whores.  Come here, whores.  All English whores.  Lady Di was a whore slut, man. 
[78:00]
 I'm just trying to be popular.  I'm like Mighty Joe Young.  Rum got rampant through the city.  Lady Di was a slut whore.  Going out with a towel head.  Making our country all pissed off and all.  Look at me just smack it down in Stammy.  Shut up, bitch.  Am I making any headway? 
[78:30]
 Or I'm winning over the people of England?  Well, they're still a little pissed, Iron Mike.  Well, they're all stupid.  They got two TV stations that suck.  Yeah, look at my mighty man for you, bitch.  They only got two teeth in their whole head.  I went to that, uh, I went to the London Zoo the other day. 
[79:00]
 And they tried to stop me from leaving.  So I'm a lot of escapee.  Shut up.  Sam Ferguson is a fat bitch.  I don't care if she's on that Weight Watches or nothing.  I make her lose weight.  I go, come here, come here.  You know why you eat so much?  Because your mouth works.  Now it don't.  Now you lose some weight.  Fat bitch.  Look, your hair's red.  Now so's your nose. 
[79:30]
 And now so's your ass.  Oh, look, here's the queen.  Come here, queen.  Right in the face.  You dried up slut.  You're making my guys laugh.  Try to stay in character. 
[80:00]
 Man it up, or Rick screwed up my sound effect.  Now I'm going to go climb Big Ben in swatted hair craft.  T'was Beauty killed the Beast.  Hey, it's Fay Ray.  Take me back to Skull Island.  You nasty ass English people. 
[80:30]
 You've got the big gappy old teeth.  I love the Irish Republican Army.  I'm learning how to make car bombs.  You people suck.  Am I winning them over?  Am I winning them over?  I don't think so, Iron Mike.  I appreciated what the Luftwaffe did.  They ruined my aircraft back in World War II. 
[81:00]
 Look at this.  I'm going to bite off Prince Charles' ears.  That's a hell of a meal.  He's got some big ass ears.  He's an ugly motherfucker.  Here you go.  I bet he's got a little acorn in his pants because his wife, the whore bag, Lady Di, was going out with a towel head.  People of England, your Lady Di was a whore. 
[81:30]
 How am I doing?  You're not showing too well there, Iron Mike.  He had a muff like Don King's hair.  I'm going to have a heart attack.  I'm going to get even more flak from you limies than Prince Charles is going to take it in the leather Cheerio. 
[82:00]
 Come here, Sarah Ferguson.  Bend over.  I'm going to punch you in the rectum.  That's a low blow. 
[82:30]
 Iron Mike, everyone.  Let me know if I'm welcome back.  I'm sure.  You guys sucked at the Falkland Islands.  A bunch of little Mexicans kicked your ass.  James Bond's a pussy.  I better get inside. 
[83:00]
 I'm starting to throw stuff at Mike.  I can't do this.  Oh my God.  I can breathe again. 
[83:30]
 1027 WNEW.  It's the Opien Anthony Show.  Actually, it's the Anthony Show right now.  No, come on.  That's all right.  I bow to you today, man.  I've been around you a long time, man.  I haven't laughed that hard in well over a year.  Oh my God.  Mike, what's up?  Tom Brokendorff just called, and that was the bit of a century, he said.  Of the century.  It was the bit of the aught, he said.  That was unbelievable. 
[84:00]
 You guys got to play that again so I can tape that.  You know what?  No one else will play it before we get out of here.  It's really a Friday.  You could just play it again for the rest of the show.  You guys go home.  We weren't even supposed to do new stuff today.  Maybe we'll end the show with that today.  Great job, guys.  That was great.  Have a good weekend.  You too.  You seem to like that.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how are you doing, guys?  I think you guys got me sent to rehab.  What happened?  I was sitting there smoking my bong listening to you guys.

[86:00]
 Now we're going to have a problem between that and the CBS bit.  Thank you, Brian.  I appreciate it.  Mike, what's going on?  Iron Mike is going to kick your ass.  Are you crazy, man?  You're crazy.  What's he going to do?  I don't know, man, but he's real fun to have.  His little stars are everywhere.  All right, Mike.  Thanks.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I'll be.  All right.  Anthony, how's it going?  All right, listen.  Those flowers, I've got to say, but you know, about what you said about Pitcher's studying 
[86:30]
 that, that was pretty bad, don't you think?  Well, she's a whore bag.  The chick was a slut.  Why do you think she was in the backseat of that car?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know.

That powerhead boyfriend of hers' member was in her hands ripped right off.  Almost like getting a punch from Mike Tyson.  That's what she would look like if one of my blows.  That's right.  She's screaming from the grave, that dead bitch. 
[87:30]
 I heard it was caught in her teeth.  Teeth.  How do you spell teeth?  Don't ask Mike Tyson how to spell.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  T-E-F-F.  T-E-A-F-F.  Toofs.  How do you spell teeths?  What do you got, Mike?  I just wanted to tell you guys how hilarious that bit was. 
[88:00]
 Oh, cool.  I'm a first-time caller.  I've only been listening to you guys for a couple months now because I just moved to North Jersey.  I couldn't get you guys before.  Thank you.  But you guys are actually hilarious.  Cool. We appreciate it, Mike.  Just keep it up, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Wow, all the calls.  That's all they want to talk about.  I know.  I know we can move on to something else.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  All right.  Hey, man.  I'm on my way down to South Jersey.  I almost crashed my car into a snowbank. 
[88:30]
 All right.  Listen, I was practically crying.  I got people staring at me in other cars.  Hilarious.  Keep up the great work, man.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Take it easy.  You know, we're going to have to replay that before we leave for the weekend.  All right.  What we'll do is we'll replay it at the end of the show in case you missed it, okay?  Right when we leave.  Mike Tyson in England trying to win over the crowd from a...  Didn't sound so good.  ...from a police station window.  Didn't sound like he was doing very well. 
[89:00]
 All right, Anthony.  All right, Anthony.  Rick has found the tape of the rock from yesterday.  Cool.  We're going to take a very quick break.  Seriously, a very quick break.  I'm seriously, guys.  Seriously.  Uh, ooh.  Wow.  Whoa, wait.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Oh, they did an impression that sounded just like Carmen there.  Thank you.  Wow.  How many drinks do you have to do for that in a drinking game?  Thank you.  Don't ask me to do it again.  For the love of God.  It has to be this valium, man. 
[89:30]
 He's still on it.  Everything's fine.  Now he's buying it on the corner.  No, no, no, no.  I buy a special kind of valium.  You smoke it out of a glass pipe.  Someone called up earlier and said, did I hear Oak do an impression during the...  I know.  ...Star Jones thing?  I did a little quaint, too.  Jesus Christ.  Taking my gig over here, I'll be...  If I keep it up, I could be like Gallagher, too.  I could tour the country as Anthony.  Almost like Anthony, but not quite like him.  Gallagher, too. 
[90:00]
 Smashing the watermelon for everyone.  All right.  Yeah, quick break, Ant.  Yeah.  Before that, an O&A favorite here.  And then as soon as we get back from commercials, we're going to replay the rock from yesterday.  Cringe Radio at its best.  Stay right where you are.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Train wreck radio.  Get him over.  This is sicker than faces of death.  One, eight, two, seven, WNEW. 
[90:30]
 It's the O&A shoot on one, oh, two, seven, WNEW on this lovely FU Friday.  Hello.  Hi, Marian. What's up?  How are you guys?  Good.  Hey.  I have to tell you, you made this week of feeling like total crap.  So bearable, I laughed. 
[91:00]
 And today especially, if I was sitting in my office as opposed to sitting in bed, I know.  Oh my God, let's listen to that.  I would have been handed a pink slip for not being able to control my laughing.  Let's make you feel good tonight.  Okay, Marian.  Stop. That's not nice.  I can't believe how crappy I feel.  I'm a little clogged up.  Well, you're a snot factory.  Just a little.  And I feel like this, it's a Sunday night.  I hate that feeling. 
[91:30]
 Isn't it the worst?  Hate it.  You know, you go for the flu shot, you think you're doing the right thing.  Oh, you got a flu shot?  How did I got a flu shot?  Yay me, right?  You know, I got to say, I don't believe in flu shots.  Well, I'll bet you did.  I think anyone who gets a flu shot and doesn't get the flu wouldn't have gotten the flu anyway.  That's why they didn't get the flu.  Because I hear people, oh, you got a flu shot.  Yeah, I don't know what happens.  Sometimes it doesn't take.  It's a placebo.  Well, it wasn't enough to get the hundred dollars in antibiotics that do nothing but put you to sleep  and just put you out of your misery for an hour or two. 
[92:00]
 But, see, I don't mind that.  You have flu.  No, you need that.  Antibiotics don't help a flu.  Isn't it the greatest feeling though when you get one nostril clear?  You're like, oh, I can breathe.  Oh, damn, it's clogged up.  But by the time you go to sleep, no good.  Marian, you know what clears your nose out though?  What?  Sex.  It's true though, right?  Got to get the juices flowing.  You have a stuffed nose.  It's scientifically proven.  Like all of a sudden it just opens up your airways and everything.  Have you just gotten over a cold, Anthony? 
[92:30]
 The second, no.  Marian, if you blow real hard, what do you mean?  Her nose.  Oh, okay.  Well, we'll clear up, man.  You guys are the best.  Not everything we say is in the gutter, Anthony.  Listen, Anne, I know what you've gone through.  My closet just went through.  But hang in there.  Stay strong and just be careful what you say because women are bitches.  Hey, Marian, can I speak for Anthony and probably other people out there?  Okay.  And there are a lot of people out there that are very happy that they're getting divorced. 
[93:00]
 Oh, I know.  It's not like, it's not always a tragedy or a wake for the person.  It doesn't sound like Anthony holding the razor against his wrist.  Believe me, I understand.  No.  All I'm saying is that she can have like 10 people listening.  Just got to get, okay, he said that he, you know what I mean?  People get so petty, so that's all I'm saying.  Believe me, you sound fine.  This is my job, talking about my life.  There you go.  Well, you guys are great.  Have a great weekend.  Try to stay warm, then.  Oh, my God. 
[93:30]
 What about that?  I'm sorry.  Excuse me.  I couldn't help myself.  What, do you have a clogged nose?  What are you doing?  No, you could just, you could like make, see, you're not the only one that could do impressions  on the show.  Oh, great.  You're a fascinating mate, right?  Dude, that is so friggin disgusting.  You guys are too much.  All right, Marion.  Take care.  Have a good weekend.  Bye. 
[94:00]
 Bye.  There she goes, everyone, Marion.  All right, Rick queued up the rock from yesterday.  The croc.  This is definitely worth replaying today.  Definitely, considering it's the talk of the internet.  Every wrestling site is talking about the Rock's appearance on our show yesterday.  Should we quickly do, just quickly do the history, the quick rundown.  Of our relationship with the Rock.  And the WWF.  Well, for a long time, we were...  We don't have to be as harsh today because we said what we had to say yesterday, but 
[94:30]
 pretty much just lay the facts out really fast before we get into this.  For quite a while, we would talk about the WWF and their events.  We would watch them on TV, get their pay-per-views, promote them, and they wouldn't do it.  And they wouldn't pay money to be on this station.  We did it because we enjoyed it.  And we'd have wrestlers on here.  Some of them did good interviews.  Some of them did bad interviews.  But we rolled with it, had a good time with them.  Had a great...  Had a good relationship with the WWF.  They definitely added to our radio show without a doubt. 
[95:00]
 We share similar audiences, I think, portions of our audience.  And then they say, we have the Rock for you.  Rock is like the top guy in WWF right now.  So they send the Rock up, and we figure we'd have this guy Sickboy on our show,  who runs a wrestling website and very informed on wrestling.  Could add another dimension to the whole thing.  So he's in here.  What we didn't know was Rock was informed that on Sickboy's website were some,  could be called racist comments, I guess. 
[95:30]
 I think it was more satire.  And the Rock was very upset that Sickboy was even here in the studio.  He asked us if we knew anything about this Sickboy's website and the racism that's on it.  We kind of said no, but we know about his website.  It's satire, blah, blah, blah.  Rock pissed off, gets up, and storms off the show.  After we told him we had no idea about what he was talking about, which we didn't, had no clue.  We were blindsided.  And then we were upset because he wouldn't discuss it after we went off the air.  He just kind of left. 
[96:00]
 And it was just like, whoa, what did we do wrong, you know?  So we finally, we never, well, then a week goes by,  we really never got an explanation from the WWF about what happened.  We felt like someone, you know, should have gave us an explanation.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden out of nowhere they say, well, you know, we want to rebook the Rock on your show.  And he'll explain himself and you guys can say and do whatever you want.  We're like, fine, I guess that's fair.  Fair enough.  We're a little upset about it.  And then we were invited to the grand opening of the WWF restaurant the other night. 
[96:30]
 We didn't want to go because we felt a little weird about everything.  But we were convinced that it would be a great time.  They want us there.  It would be great.  Please come down.  Please.  We'd love to see you.  Yeah.  Pick up the story there.  So we go down there with our invitations.  We're on the list.  We're going to get in.  What the hell?  Have a little fun with one of these grand opening things.  We stand in line for an hour in the freezing cold.  Chicks with us, oh. 
[97:00]
 And they're very disappointed they don't get in.  Chicks in hot skirts.  I don't understand why you ladies do that.  It's like two degrees out.  Yeah, single digits.  And Sandy has a hot skirt on.  Most of her leg is showing.  Rick's wife's same hot skirt type of thing.  I'm like, you guys are nuts.  Yeah, it was a little cold for a skirt.  Although Rick was wearing one too.  Kind of weird, but I guess he could tell.  Well, he came right from the show.  I'm still in the skirt on from our radio show. 
[97:30]
 Anyway, we stand in line for an hour.  Rick goes and tries to look for somebody that we have a relationship with.  And no one wants to hear it.  No one knows anything.  Long story short, we don't get in.  Don't get in.  Us and close to a thousand people.  I thought it was more like five or six hundred, but a bunch of people said it had to be close to a thousand.  The place was filled to capacity.  Please go home.  No one else is getting in this evening.  Thank you.  Clear the streets.  Rick did talk to a couple of guys from WWF.  They could care less.  Yeah. 
[98:00]
 After we were personally invited by some big hot shows from the WWF.  Yeah.  So we were definitely hurt.  Let's not, you know, pussy foot around this.  And we practically were banging on the window of the place trying to get someone's attention going, hey, we're here.  We want to come in.  Something.  Yeah.  Well, you know, next it was so we're pissed.  Next day, which is yesterday, we're scheduled still to have The Rock come in.  We have no intention of letting him on the show.  And we and we said such we said, yeah, we were just we were filled to capacity here in the studio. 
[98:30]
 Right.  Can't let anyone else in.  Right.  After you.  We had a big wake from the WWF on and we even said, look, don't even bother bringing them by.  Yeah.  They thought it was cute to bring them on by.  So we just had them on the phone in the lobby of this building, which is a floor up.  Yeah.  And two locked doors away.  We're not going to lie.  We were pussies.  Yeah.  The studio was locked.  We had two huge cops.  Interestingly, though, The Rock brought a huge guy with him as well.  Really?  Huge security guy that meant business as well.  So I think on their side, they weren't sure how everything was going to be down here as well. 
[99:00]
 Yeah.  All right.  So we send the Puerto Rican to do our battle for us.  Rick, once again.  Rick goes upstairs.  We go, Rick, you have to be there to give the phone to Rock.  OK.  And I guess that's where we're going to pick up the tape.  Rick upstairs with The Rock, with The Rock having no idea what is about to happen.  Yeah.  And then stay tuned because I think J-More pops on at the end of this whole bit. 
[99:30]
 So here it is.  Check it out from yesterday.  Rick!  Yo!  What's going on, buddy?  Not much, dude.  I'm upstairs with the notorious Rock.  All right.  And he's now outside talking to his peeps, so to speak.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I think they're going to pull him out of here, believe it or not.  They're not going to put him on the phone?  I don't know.  We'll see.  All right.  Here he comes.  OK.  All right, cool.  Here he comes.  Here we go.  I don't care.  What?  Hello. 
[100:00]
 Hey, Dwayne.  What's this?  It's O.P. and Anthony.  How are you?  Boys, how are y'all doing?  Pretty good.  Very good.  What's going on?  Not much.  What's going on with you?  Not too much at all.  Whoever sang that last song was pretty damn good.  That's a good one, right?  I'll say it tonight.  It was entertaining.  That's good.  Yeah.  Well, we were looking forward to seeing you last night at the big party.  Yeah, I heard about that.  I just got buzzed about that.  The best I could do is apologize.  I'm a candy-ass Jim Byrne.  Didn't do what he needed to do.  No, we just went outside.  Hey, you know what?  Legitimately, y'all should be happy about that.  We'll see you in the next one.  We'll see you in the next one.  We'll see you in the next one.  We'll see you in the next one. 
[100:30]
 Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  You know what?  Legitimately, y'all should be pissed off about that.  I absolutely agree.  You know, he did tell me you guys were coming down.  I'd look forward to seeing y'all.  But, I apologize about that.  Really?  This is a little awkward, isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, we had a little issue from the last time. 
[101:00]
 Well, you know...  We didn't really deal with...  Here's the thing.  You're absolutely right.  We didn't do that.  You know, now that I'm here, I appreciate y'all letting me on.  The thing about that was, as far as for being in the same room, I was buzzed about that  guy, Sickboy.  He came in.  I just certainly couldn't be in the same room with an ass like that.  And if y'all took it personal, it certainly didn't mean to be taken that way.  I just had to get the hell out of the room.  And that's the way it was. 
[101:30]
 So, you know, the way I left wasn't the most professional way.  I shouldn't have left like that.  But at the same time, again, man, I just couldn't be in the same room with that asshole and  excuse the language.  And I did let a lot of listeners down and realized that.  But you took it personal.  We took it very personal because I told you flat out and I had no idea what you were talking  about.  You didn't believe us.  No, no, no.  That really wasn't the case.  It wasn't the case that I didn't believe you guys.  It was just the case I had this guy sitting right here beside me.  If not, I wouldn't have bashed his brains in. 
[102:00]
 And that's something I take very personally in terms of racial discrimination.  And, you know, doing that, I didn't want you guys to take it personal.  And I'm not saying I didn't believe you guys when you guys flat out looked me in the eye  and said, we have no idea what you're talking about.  We have no clue about this guy's website.  Well, that was the truth.  And then I...  You know, and it's just like I told Jim Byrne earlier, you know, I even talked with Vince.  I said, you know, whether or not those guys knew really wasn't the case. 
[102:30]
 And I pretty much believed them that they didn't know.  I just had a guest on who had this, you know, real crappy website posting, you know, racist  comments.  The point was I just couldn't be in the same room with that guy.  I got up, I left, I took it personal in terms of him being there with me.  Again, one of the most professional thing to do just to get up and walk off the... walk  off your guys show that way.  I know you guys are big supporters.  WWF were.  Were.  Of The Rock.  I knew that too.  Read the article.  Saw one of you was chewing on The Rock's head. 
[103:00]
 But you know, again, it was never made to be taken personal towards you all too.  I just was pissed that you left without even like when we were off the air, I just wish  you were like drag this out in the hall and explain yourself.  Well, I certainly could have done that.  But the thing about that was I just wanted to get the hell out of there with that guy.  That was the thing.  We were in shock.  We're like, where the hell did this come from?  At least explain yourself.  And then the WWF doesn't even, you know, have the courtesy to like calls the next day to  explain what the hell was going on.  Oh, see, I thought they did. 
[103:30]
 No.  No one has ever given us an explanation until right now.  They were pissed at us.  Oh, is that right?  It's kind of weird.  Yeah, because then I won't say who called us, but one of your people's called and said  that you guys were listening after you left and you're not and they weren't happy about  what was going on.  Well, who called?  You might as well say who the candy ass was.  Susan Warner.  Okay.  The one that's probably right next to you right now.  Okay.  So she gave me her cell phone number.  I called her back.  And she, I guess you were busy at the book signing. 
[104:00]
 I was.  I did have a book signing that day.  And she said, well, I can't discuss it now.  And that was the last we heard.  And then on top of that, you know, we were like shut out of the cute little party last  night.  So we're really pissed off.  No, no.  I don't blame you about the party.  I don't blame you one bit about the party.  And had I known you all were standing out there, again, Jim Byrne buzzed me last night.  Did you guys respect?  Because I hadn't talked to Jim.  I said, listen, Jim, I called him yesterday and we finally talked last night at the WWF  in New York. 
[104:30]
 I said, you know, where are those guys at?  I want to know where we're at in terms of this.  I need to talk to him beforehand and let him, you know, let myself explain what happened.  So anyway, he told me that you guys were supposed to be there.  And I know you guys are putting your asses off out there.  I would have had Jim or somebody, Jim Dodson or somebody just come up and get you guys.  Yeah.  We had like girls with us.  We looked like ass wipes, man.  It's like all of a sudden the cops are chasing us away.  Our chicks are looking at us like we're like a couple of losers, man.  It was so effing embarrassing, man.  And Rick, Rick, who's up there with you, he's pounding on the, on the window of the place 
[105:00]
 and everyone's ignoring us.  He went up to a couple of WWF people and they, they didn't know who we were.  We weren't on any list.  It was just, it was just bad.  We had our stupid little invitations like everybody else that got chased away.  It was just so freaking embarrassing.  And you had skirt with you to boot.  Yeah.  You know how bad that looks.  I look good, especially coming off the heels of Roger there.  Yeah, of course.  I wanted to see you guys last night as I wanted to see you guys today.  I wanted to come back on the show.  As you guys know that, I sat with Vince and I said, you know, there's got to be a way 
[105:30]
 to reconcile this.  I know these guys are big fans or we're big fans for that matter of the product and as  well as the WWF as well as the Rock.  And I said, you know, I really need to reconcile this.  I didn't want them to take me leaving off their show personally.  It wasn't like that.  You guys were kind enough to let the Rock on.  I appreciate that.  But you know, again, the reasoning was just that I just couldn't be in the same room with 
[106:00]
 that guy and that was it.  You know, him being there beside me, I took it personal.  Again, you know, I wanted to stick my foot so far up area deep into his ass.  But yeah, just again, I just couldn't be there and walking off your guys show wasn't the  best thing to do.  But you know, at the time I thought it was the right thing to do.  And I didn't mean for you all to take it personally.  And again, too, you know, what made it even worse was, you know, I had a lot of rock fans  listening that day and, you know, for the most part, they kind of took it personal too. 
[106:30]
 Which certainly wasn't the case.  You know, I never ever meant it to be that way.  I just wanted to let them know too as well that it wasn't personal against the fans.  It wasn't personal against Opie and Anthony or your show for that matter.  I just couldn't be in the same room with that guy that was in and as far as for the party.  But there's a way to make it up.  If at all.  If you guys are interested in doing that, you just go on and let me know.  Well, we're like we're like hurt, man.  Yeah, we feel like losers and everything. 
[107:00]
 But we don't really feel like being in the same room with you.  No, we can't.  We can't.  We're we can't in good conscience, you know, have you come down in here when we couldn't  get into your establishment or, you know, your company's establishment, right?  You know what I mean?  So it's like I know what you mean.  No explanation needed.  I understand.  No doubt.  We also have we also have our fans that, you know, look to us to do certain things and 
[107:30]
 stand up for what we believe in.  Wrong is wrong.  What happened last night was wrong.  I don't blame you guys one bit for standing up.  No problem.  We're filled to capacity in here today.  We're filled to capacity.  Please disperse.  There's just no gobs up here.  Yeah, we could send a couple.  We got a couple down here.  I'm sure you give a pretty good fight.  Hi, Rock.  We're going to have to air strike you.  All right. No, no sweat. 
[108:00]
 Appreciate it.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  There he goes.  Hey, Jay.  You guys are brutal.  You guys have more balls than the NBA.  Dude, we made him call from our lobby.  I thought you guys were going to go, well, let's see what Jay thinks. 
[108:30]
 And I wrote like all these notes.  Oh, yeah.  That's all we need.  I said he was sorry twice.  He opened the conversation with an apology.  Yeah.  He called his own boss a candy ad.  We know The Rock has issues of rage.  And he seemed like a guy that's been to some anger management therapy sessions.  He made the terms of what he did wrong.  I don't know what it's like to be an African American, nor do I pretend to be, but I can  imagine if a guy was sitting next to me that made jokes about me being a half-breed on 
[109:00]
 a website.  And if I was The Rock and had issues of rage and I was sitting next to that person and  his name was Sickboy.  Sickboy's new name, by the way, is Rocker.  And John.  There you go.  I was like, yeah, well let the guy in.  I was like, as far as you guys waiting out in the cold, I mean, Opie I feel bad for,  but Opie I don't feel that bad for because he had coats and stuff.  Anthony we know is cold-blooded.  He could have died. 
[109:30]
 Anthony could have died out there.  Opie could have been on my shoulders and stuff.  What can Anthony do?  Wait for the sun to come out and sit on a rock.  I think you're missing the big point here though.  We just made a guy drive all the way to the station to sit in our lobby so we could tell  him he can't be on our show.  That is why you guys are the best.  Some of the instant feedback.  You guys are brutal.  That was unbelievable.  I was getting, I was like, oh this is nice.  This guy's pulling his act together.  He's like real sorry about it.  I'm like, okay, this is good.  This is nice. 
[110:00]
 Now we're all going to make friends.  And you guys go, can't we stand big?  Can't we stand the rock?  Some people actually liking the rock out of this one saying he came off good.  I got to say he did come off sounding like a gentleman.  At least we got an explanation.  He came off 3,000 miles away and I want to hug him.  He did come off sounding like a gentleman.  We do have footage of him in our lobby behind glass trying to get into the glass. 
[110:30]
 Oh my God.  You're never going to get work if you keep talking like that.  I'm fine.  I'm going to go on nightline.  We have two of the hugest cops too as backup today just in case.  I heard my local boys call you.  Billy Mack and Fat Phil.  I got a message from Fat Phil, the cop, going thanks for calling me Fat Phil. 
[111:00]
 Now everyone's calling me that.  Can't you change it on the radio?  Okay, I'm changing it.  It's Fatter Phil.  Rick's coming in.  We'll get the real story now.  That was amazing.  You guys have bigger balls than me.  You absolutely have bigger balls than me.  Although it's easy to say all that stuff when you're upstairs behind a locked glass door.  Exactly.  Hold on.  How about a massage?  All right, hold on.  We've got Rick back in the studio who is at ground zero. 
[111:30]
 I wasn't behind any glass.  You were right next to him, right?  I was about two feet away from him.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating my ass off.  I can see him like, what?  Do they want to do this on the phone?  I'm just like, yeah.  Yeah, the rock.  Yeah, the rock.  Rick's sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  I'm sweating.  Rick's sweating like Mark Fuhrman at the Million Man Market.  Oh my God.  I'm sweating like a freaking altar boy at a priest convention right now.  Rick's sweating like Mike Tyson at a spelling base. 
[112:00]
 Oh my goodness.  So how did they take it?  I guess they took it okay.  Look at his voice in the camera.  Rick is a wreck.  You've got to see Rick.  I've never seen him so freaked out right now.  Oh man.  Look at the size of these cops.  Jesus Christ.  When me and Rick almost threw down on you.  I would rather take a picture of you with your pants down right now.  Yeah, but when that happened, when Rick and I almost threw down, he had this weird glimmer 
[112:30]
 in his eye.  Yeah, like he could taste blood.  So this guy, the rock, must be unbelievable.  Yeah, I was going to taste my own.  So what did they say to you after they hung up?  Well, I tried to play stupid.  I was like, so what did the guys say?  You know, like shiver and stuff.  And I'm like, that's going to be it.  I'm like, oh, they didn't invite you downstairs?  Oh my God.  And he's like, no, that's it.  It was one like Emo Phillips on Def Comedy Jam.  And you should have seen the guy he brought with him. 
[113:00]
 Oh, this guy is built like a brick S house.  Really?  Everyone's coming up to the studio, Psycho Mark?  He grabbed the video camera from me and he's like, let me take a picture of you.  I'm like, okay, only if I can get a people's elbow.  Really?  No, the rock might hurt you with that.  He keeps talking to himself.  A lot of people think we should have let him in, but no, I'm sorry.  I thought that you should have let him in, but when you made your stand,  you opened up an entire new room of respect that I didn't know I had for you. 
[113:30]
 You know, if we would have been able to get into their little event last night,  things would have been different.  But he represents the organization that we were a little unhappy with today.  So we had to do the same thing to the rock, not let him in.  You guys have balls of steel when you're two stories beneath the earth today.  Exactly.  And poor Rick up on the front line.  Yeah, we're not stupid.  Come on, Jay, you know us. 
[114:00]
 But like you said, we made a stand earlier in the show and we had a key to it no matter what.  That's why you're the best show.  The rock came across very well.  He explained himself.  I appreciate all that.  Thank you.  But it wasn't good enough to get him in here.  We're really hurt from yesterday.  You want me to make a prediction?  Yes.  You know we're all afraid of the rock?  Yeah.  I have a friend that's in WWF school right now.  He's from New Zealand.  He's a Maori Indian.  It's not we call them Indians, but they're Maori warriors. 
[114:30]
 His name is Gingy.  I predict that he will kick the rock's ass.  Gingy will kick the rock's ass.  We'll look forward to that.  I like that dance before everything.  He's 6'6", 320, not an half a fat on him.  Alright.  Wow.  He'll kick the rock's ass.  We'll have a guy, we will actually have, speaking of we again, we, Obi and Anthony  and friends, will have a man that is bigger than the rock that we will feel safe standing 
[115:00]
 next to saying, well, up yours, rock.  Alright, Jay, we're going to let you go because we're sweating.  Alright, well, you guys, call Priceline, get Shutter's through paying telephones.  I love you guys, stay in touch.  Alright, Jay, thank you.  There he goes, the talented Jay Moore.  Keep the cop in the studio.  You've got to introduce the two huge cops that helped us out.  My God.  This is the Obi and Anthony Security Task Force that I brought in today. 
[115:30]
 Holy mother of pearl.  This is Mark and Tom.  That was a mind-blowing.  I would never want to mess with you guys, man.  You want to do that handcuff thing now?  No, no.  See how long it takes for these guys to cop you?  That's okay.  That would have to be like a record.  Like it would just be like, boom, click, done.  Well, thank you guys, we appreciate it.  Yeah, absolutely.  We're coming up here.  Big fans of the show?  Hopefully, cool.  Cool.  Say hi to the guys for us, alright?  Alright, we're going to take a break and let's hear... 
[116:00]
 People's biceps.  Yeah, people's biceps.  Let's hear it for Rick for being brave enough to be on the front lines.  I just hope Steve has on video or Mark has on video the things he made when I said, no,  you've got to do this from the phone.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden he did the neck thing and he kind of looked around.  Oh, the neck thing.  I was just like, oh, here it comes.  You never want the neck thing.  The instant feedback coming alive, people not believing we actually received the people's 
[116:30]
 apology.  Well, I appreciate that from him and stuff.  We really were hurt but...  We're still pissed off at the WWF.  You've got to say, the guy came across as a gentleman and he explained himself very well,  I think, and that's that.  And we had to stand our ground today.  We told the WWF earlier that we would not let him in today and we had to stick to that.  It would still take a miracle and an act of God to get us back on board that ship.  But, you know, I think he came across as a gentleman. 
[117:00]
 All right, man, let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Whoopi and Anthony.  There's no level 2 over here you guys won't take to.  Hey, it's a fun one.  Hey, stop.  Hey.  One, two, seven, W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony, Fidelity Diamond.  Ah, the engagement ring specialist, Valentine's Day.  Coming up, a lot of people are going to pop the question, get married.  Are you doing that this Valentine's Day, Opie?  No.  I guess not.  But there are some people that are ready to make the plunge into holy matrimony. 
[117:30]
 And, well, you want to get a good ring, don't you?  You want to know that you're getting a quality diamond.  And most of us aren't experts in the subject.  You know, and payback is a bitch.  Yeah.  Everything you said about the birth of my sister's daughter earlier in the show,  and now I get to sit here and watch you do a live read for engagement rings.  This is great.  What do you think?  Just because my marriage may have hit the rocks, Opie. 
[118:00]
 Hit the rocks?  And hit the mighty iceberg.  Your marriage received more damage than the Titanic, I think.  All of its watertight compartments are flooded.  There's not enough lifeboats.  All right, so, but what am I going to be all bitter on life itself  and people that are in love and ready to get married, Opie?  I say no.  Very good. 
[118:30]
 I say no.  I say you go to Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist.  They educate you on buying a diamond.  Most people don't know what the hell to do when they buy a diamond.  These people, you make an appointment with them.  You go in, they teach you about a diamond.  They teach you about cut, clarity, caret, the whole thing.  Teach you what a good diamond is.  You pick out your diamond loose, and you pick out your setting,  and you know what you're getting.  Simple as this.  You're not going to get ripped off, okay? 
[119:00]
 Right.  And now for the end of Valentine's Day,  buy your diamond engagement ring at Fidelity Diamond  and get a platinum engagement ring setting for free.  That's a $500 value at Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist.  Give them a call, 201-261-6555.  That's 201-261-6555 for Fidelity Diamond, the engagement ring specialist.  1027-WNEW is the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's FU Friday.  Hey, man.  Had a lot of fun on the radio this week. 
[119:30]
 Yeah.  You are listening to the award-winning Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, we actually won the Air Award for afternoon drive radio.  How about that, Opie?  Where is our little statuette?  We put it on the porn shelf in our office.  Is it like a bookend on our porn collection?  It's probably placed on the porn shelf, Anthony.  Very, very proud of that.  Yeah.  Wonderful.  We should, I don't know, should we keep it? 
[120:00]
 Yeah.  Yeah?  It's an honor.  We're not going to lie.  It's cool.  It's an honor.  It's cool just because I know how everyone else feels about us winning that thing.  Yeah.  That's the best part about it is that everybody else in the industry hates the fact that we won it.  Right.  There's even stuff on, you know, message boards and websites and stuff.  Who do you think should have won the Air Award?  For afternoon drive radio. 
[120:30]
 Yeah.  Like they don't want to accept that we won, so make up somebody else that won.  It's like, gee, thanks, guys.  We appreciate it.  We don't care.  Still on the way, Bit of the Week?  Yes.  I'm telling you right now, Ant, Bit of the Week, I mean, there was a landslide vote for the CBS bit that was written up in the paper this week.  Yeah.  But Mike Tyson bit from earlier today coming on strong.  In the stretch.  So please send in your Bit of the Week suggestions, OK? 
[121:00]
 Sure thing.  Factslide 2129579639.  All right, Anthony?  Making a very late comeback.  Anthony, did you read about Celine Dion in the paper today?  Yeah.  Everyone waiting for our comments on Celine Dion, it's being reported in the papers today that she is pregnant with twins, Anthony.  Now, one paper is saying that she's pregnant with twins.  The other is saying it's false, it's not true.  I would like to think that it is true and that Celine Dion is pregnant with twins, Ant. 
[121:30]
 Twins.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What, did they freeze her husband's sperm or something?  Did you see that?  He has cancer, so they froze his sperm and she was impregnated with her husband's frozen sperm.  Yeah.  I guess because what kind of cancer does he have that he can't just give her the high-hard one and do it that way?  Well, they wanted to, you know, make sure they were going to have kids. 
[122:00]
 Right, with no good.  Well, that's something.  This sperm, Levon.  I am pregnant.  Finally.  We have been trying for so long to get pregnant and finally my husband's sperm slammed into my egg.  Much like the mighty Titanic slammed that iceberg, splitting it open and fertilizing an egg.  To make another Celine, hopefully.  Hopefully my legacy will live on as will my camel doll. 
[122:30]
 It is such a happy moment for my 58-year-old husband, René, when he found out I was pregnant with twins.  You know, twin hippos could fit side by side in my camel doll.  But these are just twin babies.  All of the sperm that was swimming around in the icy waters of my uterus. 
[123:00]
 Do you know most of them die?  Yeah.  Most of the sperm never make it.  They die there in the icy waters of my uterus.  But two, two sperms lived on, swam, swimming, using all of their might to find the egg.  The egg to cling to.  These sperms are the ones that fertilize the eggs.  While the others died, these sperms were true survivors. 
[123:30]
 Do you know my twin children can grow to adulthood and still fit out of my camel doll?  That huge crevasse between my legs.  You should see. 
[124:00]
 Do you know the reason it had to be artificial insemination?  I know why.  They say cause René has cancer and they froze his sperm and put it in.  But the truth of the matter is, he could not even feel the sides of my mighty camel doll.  I am so huge.  He kind of slammed it against his side a couple of times, but it did not work.  So they made a sperm popsicle. 
[124:30]
 Now this frozen sperm, was it as blue as...  As blue as DiCaprio at the end of Titanic?  Yes.  That's what they looked like, this sperm frozen like Leo at the end of Titanic.  My sperm will go on. 
[125:00]
 It was like having an ice pop in there.  A frozen sperm of my husband René.  But I can have twins now.  And I will dress them in little jumpsuits to show off their tiny little camel toes.  Just like mommy.  My camel toe will live on.  My camel toe will go on. 
[125:30]
 Alright, it's a happy day for Celine and René.  Yes, congratulations Celine.  Celine, pregnant with twins.  Boy, that's got to be something for the OBGYN checking her out.  Alright, Celine, hop up on the table.  Alright, why don't we take a look of...  Oh my... 
[126:00]
 Look at the size of that.  Let's just...  Oh, hello.  Echo.  Celine, wow, you've got a lot of room in here.  Yeah, you know, I don't even need instruments.  I'm just going to crawl right in and take a look around first hand.  We don't need a sonogram or anything.  Wow, here deep inside Celine's womb.  Look at the size of this place.  Is anyone in here?  In here, in here, in here. 
[126:30]
 Mano-chio.  Mano-chio.  There's a breeze in here.  It's like a Venus fly snatch.  I've got to watch out.  It can scoop me right up.  Where the hell is the light switch in here?  It's pitch black.  Oh my God. 
[127:00]
 What's that, trout?  It's going to climb way up here.  Yeah, I could open up a water park in here.  It could just slide right back out.  Wherever you are...  I'm playing the snatch flute. 
[127:30]
 Wow.  Oh my God.  What is that?  Oh my God.  It's a T-Rex.  What the hell is that doing in here?  Let me just walk over here.  Oh my God, this is disgusting.  Who the hell is that sitting there? 
[128:00]
 Buddy Epson, what are you doing in Celine's womb?  Oh my God, look, it's that little kitten boy from Jaws.  He wasn't a shark after all.  We're swimming, got sucked up by Celine's huge cage.  Another one over here.  See who's in here.  Can we see your stuff?  Ophie!  Hey, how you doing?  All right, we're just going to go for a little pap smear here.  It might feel a little pressure. 
[128:30]
 There we go.  I think I've got enough of that.  Oh my God.  All right, I've got to get out of here.  Oh my God, look at this.  This place is huge.  Oh my God, what the hell is that? 
[129:00]
 It's coming right for us.  I don't even know what it was.  Better safe than sorry.  Very good.  We've got to do a little more.  I see a light.  What the hell is that?  Oh my God, it's a tractor trailer in Celine's womb.  Oh, there it is. 
[129:30]
 There's the little baby.  Look at the camel jaw.  Can you walk out of her womb and step out of her pants, please?  All right, just coming out through that exit here.  What's that about down the corner?  Oh, it's that way.  I've got my stuff.  Hey, what's going on here? 
[130:00]
 Is that a taxi to get back helicopter?  All right, well, there you have it.  Celine having a twin.  Congratulations to Celine and her husband there.  Maybe that's where the CBS FM broadcast from.  Celine's womb. 
[130:30]
 Opie and Anthony afternoon.  Mason and Kalinsky morning.  The Radio Chick midday on 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, man.  For this FU Friday in the studio, Jeff Norris.  Hey, Jeff, want to say hi real fast?  Oh, geez, how we doing here, huh?  It's Archie, everyone.  Archie hasn't been on the show in a while.  Been quite a while, Aaron.  Divorcing eaters, yeah? 
[131:00]
 You're divorcing eaters.  Very similar there to what my good colleague, dear Anthony, is doing.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, absolutely.  And when I'm done, I hope she looks like even Cole Brown had a paper cut.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm absolutely serious.  I don't want to mention any names, Melissa, but I won't anyway.  What's the matter there?  Having a rough time there?  Rougher than rough.  Rough ain't the word, dear.  All right.  You want to stick around for a little while, Arch?  We'll be here.  We'll be here.  We're going to play a couple tunes, take a musical break here.  It is Friday. 
[131:30]
 People like to rock a little bit with the show.  Sure.  And you only have a few minutes before we tally the votes, Anthony, for Bit of the Week.  Yeah.  It's pretty much between two bits at this point.  CBS, FM, Bit.  Yep.  And wow, right under the wire today, the Mike Tyson from England seems to have struck a nerve.  I don't think the Mike Tyson bit's going to make it.  We'll see.  Okay.  We're going to close the voting in about eight minutes, so get your vote in, 212-757-1027,  or you can fax it in at 212-957-9639. 
[132:00]
 We'll be back in two songs right here on 1027 WNAW.  1027 WNAW Metallica, No Leaf Clover from S&M, and Jane's Addiction before that.  It's open, Anthony.  It's FU Friday.  In the studio, Jeff Norris.  Where are you guys playing tonight, Jeff?  Myself and Jim Florentine will be at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  So come on down.  Have a good time.  Single ladies, please show up. 
[132:30]
 Even if you're married.  Even if you're married, show up.  Yeah, don't have to buy you dinner. It'll be beautiful.  Of course, Jeff does Archie on our show.  Very funny guy.  Shoot.  Yeah, yeah. It's been a while.  Been a while.  Been through the britches like my buddy Anthony over here.  What's the matter?  He's women.  Fell out of the relationship there.  I can't even go into character.  I'm so P.O.ed at this.  There's big-ass fuel out to you, bro.  I did.  Look at that.  He's pissed.  I am pissed.  I, on the other hand, really can't say anything, you know. 
[133:00]
 Should I share it?  Well, you can share whatever the hell you want.  All right.  Mind you, after I fix up this...  Huh!  Fix up a house.  Burn my legs fixing up a house.  She goes out tiddly winking at one of her little fags.  Computer jerks.  I go to...  I get a prank phone call the other day saying she's in a car accident.  I look all over every hospital, finally go to the house, knock on a door.  The father answers, Dory, she ain't out of my property. 
[133:30]
 You come on my property.  You come in my house.  I'm going to get a restraining order.  I'm like king of restraining orders.  She's going to get a restraining order for what?  For coming on my house property.  I said, your house, you lived in a shed before I refixed it.  So she's out there thinking, you know...  I said, we'll see what happens.  I told Jeff, just pick up a fat chick.  You'll get over it now.  You'll bang yourself a fat girl.  Yeah, yeah.  You'll get a bust out.  Clean your fatty.  Clean the palate, huh?  Exactly.  Clean the palate, start all over, do a fat front. 
[134:00]
 It's like going back in the miners, you know, you go back and regroup.  The miners, yeah.  Learn the fundamentals, you know, and then you get back into big boys.  It's beautiful.  For the fatty.  Well, you're listening to the divorce horror stories yesterday, Jeff?  I was listening, I was very concerned about my buddy over here, but much to my surprise, I come in and go, how you doing?  He goes, beautiful.  Fine.  So I...  Fine and dandy.  Doing all right.  I just look at it, you know, I'm honored to be here.  I feel bad for her.  Maybe, you know, I'll feel a little worse after I see how bad the damage is. 
[134:30]
 After the whole thing's done with.  Well, hope you got like five bucks I could borrow.  Well, I still gotta make out that check for the cruise.  Yeah.  Jeff, you hear about this one?  You hear that one?  This is a classic.  So, you know, the end of a marriage after 10 years, not that happy, you think, for, you know, for both parties.  You kind of mull it over in your head.  But, you know, my wife feeling kind of jilted, feeling kind of bad.  Happens.  Decides to take my American Express card and go on a cruise down to the Caribbean. 
[135:00]
 You know, book the flight down to Florida and take a cruise.  No, no, not just her.  She takes on my amex Opie's girlfriend along with her.  No.  Damn.  Sure.  Too bad I wasn't a Titanic.  Not in person at all, but that's okay.  Yeah, so I paid for Opie's girlfriend to take a cruise.  I hope she appreciated it.  Really, I hope Opie got something. 
[135:30]
 Did she come back saying, my girlfriend's ex-husband brought me on a cruise and all I brought him was his lousy feature?  So, Jeff, the whole time I'm sitting there praying that Anthony doesn't find out.  And then he finally like.  You knew?  Do you believe this crap?  This wrong.  Yeah, I didn't want to pay for it.  Yeah, you saved money.  Wait, wait.  He's totally agreeing with me.  Well, save a family of money.  Hey, it wasn't my idea.  It was someone else's idea.  Like it was mine?  Well, it was you know whose idea.  So I'm like, so I'm praying that Anthony doesn't find out. 
[136:00]
 He finally confronts me like a month ago and I'm like, oh really?  I didn't know about that.  That's terrible.  That's rough, man.  So now I have to like write him a check for like 600 bucks.  That was interesting when that Amex bill came in.  OK, parking at the garage, you know, 20 bucks a pop, dinner.  Oh my God, I stayed at the park of Meridian that night.  That was a couple hundred.  That was a big one.  OK, cruise, five grand. 
[136:30]
 Jim has a couple cruise tragedies too.  Yeah?  I think it happens.  Yeah, no, I never.  What?  I've never been on a cruise before.  Yeah, neither have I.  Yeah, believe me, I have no money left.  I paid for two, but I've never been on one.  No, but I've been close to marriage too like that.  So lucky I didn't have to me.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, I was ready.  I was ready to get the ring and stuff.  She said no.  So the way I look at it, she saved me probably about 36 grand. 
[137:00]
 Yeah.  Between like a condo, a ring and paying for the wedding.  And a cruise for your friend's girlfriends.  So now I got extra cash and hookers.  It's beautiful.  But the bad part is she left them before Christmas.  Right before Christmas.  About a month before.  What's bad about that?  You don't have to save her some cash.  You don't have to buy the gifts.  15 bucks on Christmas gifts.  It was beautiful.  That was in, huh?  Yeah.  I didn't have a girlfriend, but I got the new corn CD.  Nice.  And at least I could turn down the CD when I don't want to listen to it anymore.  Hey, Joe, what's up? 
[137:30]
 Joe?  Hey, man.  Did we lose Joe?  We're ready to go.  I'm just trying to figure out if the phones are screwing up today.  They're working, right?  Let me try another one.  Hold on a second here.  Jennifer, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Listen, I'm getting married April 1st.  Don't.  Congrats.  Thank you.  You are a fool.  What?  Nothing.  Plain off your teeth.  You might work for some people, Opie, you know?  Well, I want to know if you guys can...  You can't just condemn the entire institution.  Not everyone can buy cars to put it off. 
[138:00]
 Yeah, like Opie.  You hear what he did?  I love how he just ratted each other out and stuff.  Jim don't know what it is.  No, this is great.  Opie, obviously he's been going out with Sandy for how long now?  Like six and a half years.  Six and a half years.  That seven's a bitch.  In my 30s, everyone is like, when are you guys getting married?  You know, the family's putting the pressure on itself.  Seven is a key year in a relationship.  It's the make or break, the go or blow.  You know what I mean?  Right.  So, yeah, a lot of people in Opie's family, a lot of people in Sandy's family, I guess, 
[138:30]
 also wondering when's the ring coming?  When's the ring coming?  So last year, this was really an issue.  But leading up to it though, I mean, every holiday like Valentine's Day,  Oh, geez, oh, geez, got a beeper.  That's probably your ex.  Yeah, it's probably the father.  I just got the restraining order.  Really?  I'm faxing it over to you.  Anyway, all the big...  We got a radio show, you idiot.  Look at the music. 
[139:00]
 He's trying to do business.  He's trying to do business.  Who was beeping you, Jeff?  It wasn't my beeper.  Oh, look, he did a look of panic on his face.  He brought something down.  Anyway, tell Jim the story.  Yeah, so a lot of people wonder when he's going to get engaged.  Get this move.  He buys his girlfriend a car instead of the ring.  Now, she's got to be ecstatic because she's got a car.  So it takes the heat off of them for getting a ring. 
[139:30]
 Yeah, you bought a few more months.  Right.  And if you figure out the price of a ring and a car, it's really not a bad move.  Especially when you're talking about things like resale value of either.  And all the big holidays come, Valentine's Day, her birthday, Christmas,  and I just started running out of gifts.  I did the diamond rings and everything I could find, and I'm like,  Well, obviously, you know, this Valentine's Day, he's got to pop the question and break out the ring.  Yeah.  But I tricked everyone and I got a car. 
[140:00]
 A brilliant move.  But now he has to top that next time.  I know.  That's the problem.  I only got, let's see, oh my God, that's it.  I only got like four months left to try to figure out what the next big gift is.  Screw that.  I got what?  Three weeks left.  Valentine's Day, I got to get through.  Got to get something there.  That's going to hurt.  You know what you got to do?  You got to start a fight like three days before.  Right.  That's how I usually do a blow them off and then I call back like the 16th.  I'm really sorry.  I don't know what was going on.  Bypass the whole holiday. 
[140:30]
 Absolutely.  That's a good move.  That's like a gee-gee.  Yeah.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, yo, from where I'm going to say this, what kind of cheap Jew are you that you're  going to let your best buddy pay for a trip?  But then I'll just serve the rest of it.  You're going on and buying her a car instead of a ring?  Oh, come on.  No, listen, I got the best solution for you.  All right.  Well, let me answer your first question.  All right.  As far as in I go, it all evens out.  All evens out.  Hey, why don't you cash in a couple of shares of that skyrocketing stock and … 
[141:00]
 Wait, let me tell you something though, Pally.  All right, so you paid for Sandy's Cruise, yes.  Yeah.  Who gave you a great stock tip this week?  All right.  Your broker, who is also my broker.  Well, why didn't he call you?  Because he called you.  Why didn't you get me in it for?  Instead of seven.  I shared the info, which is why it hit seven.  He said he told me I hit seven.  Are you kidding?  You could have paid for the whole cruise right there.  Hey, yo, listen, this is for April, right? 
[141:30]
 Yeah.  April 1st, they extend to a nice, quiet restaurant.  As soon as the dessert comes, slide a ring box across the table.  Leave it empty.  When she opens it up, say, April fools.  If she doesn't dump you in, she never will.  That's a great way to get dumped, man.  Go for it.  It's not a question of wanting to dump her.  I'm just not into the marriage thing yet.  So you know what? 
[142:00]
 Try it out.  If she stays with you, then you know she's a good girl.  She'll stay with you for life.  I think I know she's a good girl already, the crap she has to put up with.  I can tell you she's a good girl too.  Yeah.  There we go.  I'm not even going down that road.  Thank you.  She went down that road.  All right.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  What were you going to say to her?  That might work.  She might get so mad that you did that, she might even give you the car back.  Right.  So try to run your over with the goddamn thing.  It's one of those girl chick cars. 
[142:30]
 I can't drive it.  That's another thing.  He gets her a chick car, so he can't even drive it.  There's no reason for that.  I don't know.  We can laugh.  I wish we could share with you guys.  Damn it.  All right.  All right.  Anyway, line seven.  Line seven, okay.  Ted, Ted, what's going on? 
[143:00]
 All right.  Hey, you know, I have nothing about the vote because I'm kind of happily married, but  I just want to say I met Jim Florentine last week at a show in South Jersey.  Yeah.  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get in there.  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get in there.  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get in there.  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get in there.  I'm not sure if you're going to be able to get in there.  I just want to say I met Jim Florentine last week at a show in South Jersey.  Yeah.  And if anybody hasn't seen him, he's like too funny.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Guy is so historical.  I mean, he's just a great MC.  He's a great feature.  And he's like, you just laugh your ass off listening to the guy.  Well, he's playing with Jeff Norris tonight at the Stress Factory.  I'm going to try to make it that. 
[143:30]
 Through the weekend.  All right.  Hey, Jim, this is Ted.  I met you at the Seagull Inn.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  Hey, hopefully one of these days you can give me a good spot somewhere.  Absolutely.  Bring some girls.  Absolutely.  Well, yeah.  Everyone wants chicks.  You got it.  What's wrong with that?  Thanks, man.  Come down.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Yeah, we're at Stress Factory this week.  Very cool.  All right.  What happened to Jeff?  Is he all right?  I love this show. 
[144:00]
 This is the best show ever.  Let me say, oh, let me say, this will be very funny.  Go ahead.  Rick, get on mic and just say that we're in the middle of a worst up show.  Worst of Opie Anthony.  Any requests for bits, give a call, 757-1027.  So we're not live, so anything that was said today happened a long time ago, right? 
[144:30]
 Yeah.  Okay.  Line 12, for real.  For you, for you, really.  Pick it up.  Hello.  Who is this, Ope?  Yeah.  You guys are getting me in trouble here.  Who's this?  Jeff Norris.  Hey, what's the problem, Jeff?  We were just playing a clip of when you were here in the studio.  I know you're playing clips, but I know Jim's there tonight.  I had an incident today.  I had to leave work.  I go to the hospital.  I phone in to talk to Jim.  He says, oh, I'll put you on over the phone with Jim. 
[145:00]
 My pager goes off.  The guys at work think I'm in the studio, and now I'm in trouble at my job.  What?  They think I'm in the studio.  Oh, no.  No, that was pre-recorded.  Well, I call in and talk to Jim about the plug in the show for this weekend, and now  they think I'm in trouble here.  Oh, no, no.  Who is it?  I'll make it clear over the air that I was not in the studio.  Oh, you tell your employers that, yeah, obviously you're on the phone.  Yeah, how could you be in the studio if you're on the phone? 
[145:30]
 When I called you from speaker from my brother's house, they hear the pager go off.  Oh, so it's that, yeah.  They heard the pager.  They think I'm there.  Hey, Jeff?  Yes.  You're screwed.  Here I am.  I mean, I had an emergency.  I had to leave work today.  I was trying to do the show tonight with Jim.  I call in, and now they think I'm in trouble with the job.  No, Jeff Norris was never in the studio today.  All right, Jeff.  I mean, if you guys are playing fits, do me a favor.  Say that you're playing fits.  They don't think I'm in the studio.  You got it.  Please, because I'm in trouble. 
[146:00]
 All right, Jeff.  I'll make it clear that we fit.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Who the hell is going to do that?  I didn't think he got in that much trouble.  All right, Jim.  So you guys are at the Stress Factory, okay?  Yeah, we're there.  Yeah, this Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Good to Stress Factory.  Okay.  Good show, man.  All right, we've got to take a quick break.  How do you feel about the show?  I'm happy.  I'm happy.  I'm happy.  Hi, this is Jeff.  I'm on a rooftop at my work, where I'm supposed to be. 
[146:30]
 So please tell everybody I'm really not there.  Thank you.  Hi, this is Jeff, calling from the content of the 747.  I'm not in the studio.  It just sounded like I was in the studio.  Now I've got no one to split the park in with. 
[147:00]
 Very good.  All right.  On the way, Anthony, Bit of the Week.  Yeah.  Very interesting vote at the last minute there, okay?  All right.  I'm eager to see what it is.  I think we can play a quick round of what did we learn on the Open Anthony show, and  we'll end the show with Bit of the Week.  Give us a call, 212-757-1027.  Open Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off of the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen. 
[147:30]
 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Open Anthony show.  It's FU Friday.  Yeah.  Boy, what a show we've had today.  We've had a lot of fun this week.  We've had a lot of fun the last three weeks, ever since we got back from vacation.  Yeah.  We all rested.  We all rested.  We appreciate the support.  Thank you.  It means a lot to us.  Screw everyone else.  Yeah.  Let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Open Anthony show.  Then we're going to end with Bit of the Week. 
[148:00]
 All right.  Should we?  Yeah, we got to tell everyone.  The Mike Tyson bid from earlier.  Yes.  It's Bit of the Week, Anthony.  Snuck in under the wire.  Last minute.  Hilarious.  Mike Tyson.  Audio of Mike Tyson from London when he was outside a window with a megaphone trying to  calm down all the supporters.  Protesters, I should say.  Protesters.  Oh, they hate him over there.  They don't want him in their country for the fight.  All the women's groups are up in arms. 
[148:30]
 Yeah.  And it's getting so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police station and he  was trying to calm him down outside a window with a megaphone.  And we got the audio.  So, megaphone.  Can't understand him out of his mouth.  It's very funny.  Through a megaphone.  All right, let's play What Do We Learn on the Open Anthony show.  E.J., what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  All right.  I learned that the little kid there, boy, was really eaten by Celine's gash.  And I learned that Mike Tyson smelled T-E-F-F. 
[149:00]
 Very good.  Have a good weekend, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Let's be reasonable.  This is not the time nor place to perform some kind of a half-ass autopsy on her camel  toe.  You know, he got it wrong, though.  I correct him.  What?  We found out that the Kittner boy was actually in Star Jones' gash.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Was that where he was?  Yes.  Remember today?  Remember Star Jones was like the big shark in Jaws?  Right.  And Quint slid into Star Jones' gash.  But he was also in Celine's gash earlier in the day, Opie. 
[149:30]
 Oh, so there was a couple things going on there.  Okay.  I'll have to keep track of that little Kittner boy.  All right.  He's all over the damn place.  Mike, what's going on?  I learned you should always put your feet broad-bidding.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  Mike, chime in.  Okay.  We love this game.  Andrew, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  What's up, guys? 
[150:00]
 All right.  Yeah, I learned that a tractor trailer keywrecked an Opie can fit in Celine Dion's match.  Yes.  How old are you, Andrew?  13.  Very good.  You love the Opie and Anthony show.  You're a quick learner.  Thank you.  All right, bye.  We're his heroes, Opie.  All right.  Mike, you're next.  What did you learn on the show?  Like that'll make it through.  I learned that Opie can do impressions and suck his snot with the greatest of ease.  Thank you.  Thank you very much. 
[150:30]
 And I also learned this week that Earl will never get a job at Lensclaster.  One hour.  Ho, ho, ho.  Ha, ha, ha.  You're not funny, love.  All right.  Angelo, you're next.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned that when you buy your fiancé a car, you get about 12 months worth of freedom.  Yes.  Yeah, guys, you're great.  All right.  Thank you, Angelo.  All right.  Just a few minutes away from bit of the week, Anthony.  Yes.  Mike Tyson.  Let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Yes, Opie.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right. 
[151:00]
 All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Yes, Opie.  Oh, a caller.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  You're real funny.  I learned that you guys got bigger balls than King Kong.  I have one other thing to say.  Opie, how many balloons did you have to give Rick after yesterday's conversation?  Oh, I've got to tell you, man.  Rick and I rode the train home together.  We talked about it the whole time.  He was so freaked out.  I'm like, dude, I can't even sit next to you.

 And I learned if you work for a very popular radio show in New York City, you shouldn't  speak really loud enough in sushi restaurants. Very true. And congratulations going out to  my sister once again. The birth of her daughter, Jamie Lee. Husband Mike and my sister Holly.  Very, very excited today, Anthony. Well, it sounds like husband Mike was more excited 
[153:30]
 a few months back. Relax, man. He was slipping her the high hard one. Right, though? You  don't want to think of your sister like that. You know what? I can't even go to the phones  now because that's all everyone wants to do is abuse my sister who's like in a hospital  that's not abusing. It's just fact. I'm sure at some point she was probably on all fours  getting dogged from behind by Mike. You know, it's just the fact. It's the way it is. I  remember as the little girl that was running around the house, the little sister that you  protected. But at some point, you know, he was slamming her. Matt, what's up? What's 
[154:00]
 up, ONA? Help me. I learned not to make any family announcements on the ONA show. Very  good. Any. Any. Yes, very good. I've been listening to you guys since August in 17.  I've been telling everyone. We appreciate that. All right. Take care, guys. Lord knows  is no marketing dollars available for the Opium Anthony show. Hell no. Keep word of  mouth is the way we're going to get anything going in this town. I learned something today. 
[154:30]
 All right. Rick? After listening to Anne talk about your sister, I think she might have  a flat forehead, right? What? What? No. What is so bad? John, what's up? What did you learn  on the show? The college kids are much safer in bed. Oh, because the kid that slept through  the fire? Yeah. I mean, next time the fire alarm goes off, same bed. All right. Very 
[155:00]
 good. Okay. Thank you. What's wrong? Nothing. I just now that this wind has been taken out  of the sales from the red comment. I know. All right, Rick, say something. Go ahead.  No, it's all right. Get Rick a break, man. Can't get a train? No, because after what  he did for us in our show yesterday, you got to get a little slack, man. I know I don't  have balls to do what he did yesterday, and I certainly know you don't have balls to go 
[155:30]
 up there and. In front of the rock. And have the rock two feet away from you while two  guys are telling me can't be on the radio show. The best description Rick gave was when  he handed the rock the phone, told him he wasn't going to be able to come down to the  studio. They had to do the interview on the phone and he said the rock did that neck thing  he does in the ring. You know, where you're like slips his neck sideways kind of real  quick and the eyebrow goes up and he snorts. Yeah. The Brahma bull. Man, I just like crapped  myself at that point. With that, I have to give Rick a break today without a doubt. All 
[156:00]
 right. Thank you. We got a plug. Jeff Norris is gig. Call them to plug the stress factory  today. Yeah. And his buddy Jim's in the studio. Yeah. This Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Actually  I got a big up Jeff in Jersey in a little while. Yeah. So it'll be good. We'll have  a good time. Man, Jeff does good impressions and yeah, well tell him to get in here at  some point. You know, we'd like to see him. Yeah, I was going to bring him, but he's too  big. He can't fit my car. He's a big guy. Jeff. Yeah. That's why I became friends when 
[156:30]
 I first saw him. I'm like, man, this guy's big. I don't want to bend me over and rape  me. So I've got to be friends with him. Plus I didn't have any corks. Yeah. Don't worry.  He's good. That's enough. Okay. You know, fine. I'll give you guys your pleasure here  today. Jeff, what'd you learn on the show today? Well, we learned that nine months ago  your sister got railed royally and then five more weeks until she can get it again. These 
[157:00]
 people are brutal. My poor sister. Donny, what's up? Yeah. I learned that we didn't  learn what position OP's sister was in when she got nailed by a... Hey David. Hey. What  did you learn on the show? I learned that your sister's most fertile and the dog you  have to be. George, what'd you learn on the show today? Yeah, I learned that no matter 
[157:30]
 what position she's in, she could conceive a baby. Hence the flathead comment. Thank  you. Don't try to dig it back up now, right? Unlike the kid on Millionaire, trying to answer  the question after he's still bummed. Galaxia. Hey guys. Hi. Okay. I learned how to spell  K-E-E-F. Very good. Thank you, Galaxia. Bye guys. All right. With that, Ant, we've got  to play Bit of the Week. Okay. And get our asses out of the studio. Yeah. We had a fun 
[158:00]
 week. I hope you enjoyed listening. Yeah, we did have a very fun week. Have a great  weekend. Action packed. And we'll see you guys Monday at 2, all right? Affirmative.  We leave you now with Bit of the Week. Okay, listen. I don't know if you've seen the audio  yet, but it's all over CNN. Mike Tyson's over there. Is he fighting again this weekend?  I've lost track of Tyson. I guess he's in England fighting, trying to get his boxing  career on track again. And the people just thrilled to have him. They can't stand him. 
[158:30]
 They're outside his hotel just protesting, saying that they should throw Mike Tyson out  of England. Mostly the women's groups, Anthony. The women hate him. The women hate him over  there. They don't appreciate what he's done to women over here in our country. They feel  that he doesn't belong in their country. He was put in prison for rape, raping a woman.  And then there were allegations by his girlfriends and ex-wives about abuse, all kinds of stuff. 
[159:00]
 He should have to go back to prison for marrying the lady he's with now. Oh my God. Oh. That's  not funny. What are you talking about? So, on CNN they got footage of Mike Tyson. I guess  the protesting has gotten so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police station  because they're just protesting wherever he goes. So he's out this window at the police 
[159:30]
 station with a megaphone trying to talk to the lady protesters. That's what you want  him to do. Like talk to the protesters. That won't piss them off any more than they already  are, right? Oh, I'm sure. Hey, hey you limey bitches. Any limey bitches want coming here  and see who can take a punch like Robin Givens? Come here you bitches. I'm going to kick your 
[160:00]
 ass. Come here. You're the first one. Look at you, you toothless bitch. Come here. You're  the second one. I'll punch you. Come here you pasty white English whore. Why are they  so angry at me? Why are they angry? Because your queen is a twat. Come here. Oh look,  look. It's the queen. Come here queen. Oh come on. You can't even take a punch. You 
[160:30]

Just like I did to that Miss  USA or whatever the hell it was I banged. I went to prison for that. I want a man in  prison. Prison. Why do I sound like the man dog? What? I'm going to beat you up. I'm going 
[161:00]

Here's a fine lady. Now I want to talk sense to you. I have been rehabilitated.  I went to prison. I'm just trying to get my fighting career back. Hey don't look at me  like that. What did I do? I don't even understand. I'm like an animal. He's like the Beatles 
[161:30]
 over there. They're chasing him around. Yeah but they want to kill me. They don't want  a water graph or nothing. They want to kill me. Thank God they're all too much pussies  to have guns over here. Even the police don't have them. Here's one of them bobbies with  that big stupid hat. I'm not kicking his ass. I'm like King Kong. I'm just running around. 
[162:00]
 Remember the King Kong movie? He was in New York and he couldn't do nothing. That's me  in England. The cops don't have guns so I could run rampant. Come here you bastard.  Look I'm beating up the police. Are they throwing soccer balls at you Mike? Yeah soccer balls  on the cops. Look I'm like a big guard booth in front of the palace and they got them guards  with the big fuzzy hats on. You can't make them change the expression on their face. 
[162:30]
 Watch this. See his expression now? Now look at this. Look that was a bloody expression.  I made a change. Now I'm going to take that furry hat and stick it in your keister. And  that's only to make room for my giant member. Look it's Prince William. Look at that fine  young little ass. I'm going to be himself and abuse him. I love England. We're the Spice

The chick was a slut.  Why do you think she was in the back seat of that car?  She would give a roadhead to her towelhead and boyfriend.  That gappy-tooth bitch got for all y'all. 
[169:30]
 Oh, did he hang up?  He didn't like my commentary?  I hung up on him.  I didn't want anyone wrecking our buzz today.  Our lady died?  In the back seat, I heard that that towelhead boyfriend of hers' member was in her hands, ripped right off.  Almost like getting a punch from Mike Tyson.  That's what she would look like after one of my blows.  That's right. 
[170:00]
 I heard screaming from the grave, that dead bitch.  I heard it was caught in her teeth.  How do you spell teeth?  Don't ask Mike Tyson how to spell.  All right, Mike, what's going on?  E-E-F-F.  Spell teeth.  That for all y'all.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are a bunch of pussies.
