<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with a dismissive acknowledgement of their Air Award win, immediately followed by Opie announcing his sister's childbirth, quickly overshadowed by Anthony's crude jokes about the conception.  A heated exchange ensued between the hosts.  Listener calls and various topics followed, including a discussion of David Hinkley's allegedly dismissive column about their award.  Several listeners delivered "FUs" to various individuals.  The disastrous performance of a contestant on *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire* was recounted, along with a positive listener experience seeing Stephen Lynch perform.  The hosts launched into a highly crude discussion of Kathy Lee Gifford's aging appearance, including a humorous skit.  Psycho Mark's MTV antics and upcoming stunt were teased.  The show then criticized the repetitive nature of news coverage of a recent snowstorm.  A listener expressed hatred for a Cuban refugee.  Frequent interruptions from staff members, Rick and Spaz, added to the chaotic atmosphere.  The broadcast was heavily punctuated with highly offensive and sexually explicit language and humor.

The show then transitioned into a lengthy, highly offensive segment mocking Star Jones's weight and appearance, featuring graphic descriptions and derogatory language. A caller, Dan, shared a negative experience sitting near Star Jones at a Knicks game, prompting more vulgar commentary.  The Rock's absence from the show due to an issue with a racist website, owned by guest Sick Boy, was discussed, playing a phone call where The Rock apologized for his unprofessional behavior and explained his reluctance to be near Sick Boy.  The call also covered the hosts' exclusion from a WWF party, with further vulgar and offensive language directed towards The Rock. A caller then recounted a laughter-induced disruption at a bank.  The show replayed The Rock's call and continued the discussion before culminating in a Mike Tyson impression filled with misogynistic and racist slurs aimed at the British, which was praised by callers.

Further discussion followed regarding the fallout from the WWF incident, recounting The Rock's surprisingly polite phone call despite the tense situation, highlighting Rick's nervousness during the encounter with The Rock and the significant police presence.  Anthony's marital woes led to a live advertisement for Fidelity Diamond.  The hosts revisited their Air Award win and the "Bit of the Week" segment, launching into a sexually explicit comedic bit about Celine Dion's reported pregnancy with twins via artificial insemination.  Jeff Norris and Jim Florentine, along with several callers, joined the conversation, discussing relationship issues and stand-up gigs, contributing to the already prevalent sexually explicit humor. The show concluded a vote for "Bit of the Week," which went to an audio clip of Mike Tyson attempting to calm protesters with a megaphone.

The broadcast concluded with a separate segment featuring Mike Tyson delivering a wildly offensive and comedic rant about England, its people, and the Royal Family.  He used extremely vulgar language, repeatedly calling various individuals "whores" and "sluts," making sexually explicit and violent threats.  He imagined himself as King Kong, rampaging through London, and assaulting police officers and royals. He made derogatory comments about Sarah Ferguson's weight and mocked Prince Charles's appearance, insulting English culture, television, and referencing the Falkland Islands conflict.  A caller's disapproval of Tyson's comments about Princess Diana prompted further aggressive and offensive remarks.  The rant concluded with more threats and obscenities.

[00:00:00]  1027 WNW, it's FU Friday with Opie and Anthony!  Hey!  Where's Anthony?  The fax is coming in like crazy.  If you want an FU on the pile, the fax line, 212-957-9639.  Just make it short and to the point so we can read as many of these as possible today, okay?  Absolutely.  Anthony, you want to explain FU Friday to all the brand new listeners?  We've got a lot of them lately.  Do we?  I think so.  Maybe since we're an award-winning radio show.  We've got brand new listeners. 
[00:00:30]  Well, FU Friday, it's your forum, your day.  You've been pissed off all week.  Who pissed you off?  Your boss, husband, wife, whatever?  We give you a forum to bitch to our listeners.  You can hear it.  Yeah, our listeners can hear you bitching and you can bitch to them.  There you go.  Gives you a little outlet so you don't go postal.  And the easiest way is through the fax line, okay?  Can I start the festivities today? 
[00:01:00]  Can I have the Daily News out to the place really fast?  Do you have an FU?  Oh, yeah.  FU to David Hinkley once again.  From the Daily News, who writes the radio column?  Yeah.  Ant and I won the Air Award for Best Afternoon Drive Show yesterday.  I'm very proud of our award.  Honestly, we're a little embarrassed because I'm not going to lie to you.  The Air Awards is kind of a joke.  It's pretty ridiculous.  But whatever.  It's a good honor and we appreciate it.  So page 132 of the Daily News today. 
[00:01:30]  Yeah.  David Hinkley runs down all the winners of the Air Awards.  Uh-huh.  This just shows you what people think of you and I in this town, as far as the rest of  the media goes.  They have everyone listed in bold print.  Right.  Bold print, okay?  Like, you know, Best Morning Show, Elvis Duran and the Zoo, okay?  Elvis Duran's name is in, you know, bold print, okay?  Yeah.  Lisa Taylor, Best Midday Show.  Sharon Stevens, Best Weekend Show, okay? 
[00:02:00]  Everyone is in bold print, the winners, okay?  Yeah.  Opie and Anthony of WCW.  Look at that.  We're the only one not in bold print.  Oh, yeah.  You kind of pass it right over, don't you?  It's just his way of dissing us a little bit.  Whatever.  Have your fun.  Can you believe that?  That's okay.  We're the scourge.  I love it.  We are the scourge of society.  Like, who cares?  All right.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  Before we start the show today. 
[00:02:30]  Too late.  I got to congratulate my fine sister.  Yeah, what's going on there?  And her husband, Mike.  My sister, Holly, and Mike pumped out another kid today.  Pretty fertile over there.  Well, my family is very fertile, Anthony.  Yeah.  I think we do so well in the ratings because my family listens.  Keeps growing by leaps and bounds.  They have no choice.  They have to be faithful and listen to this radio show.  That alone gives us, like, a two share, I believe. 
[00:03:00]  How was he dogging her when it, you know, when it all came together?  How do you think?  How do you think your little sister has taken it?  Cut it out.  From behind?  Shut up.  This is a proud and happy moment for my family, and you're wrecking it.  Well, the egg was fertilized at some point.  I would rather not think about how my brother-in-law dogs my sister, thank you very much.  Think of it as something done, like, on purpose to get pregnant? 
[00:03:30]  Or was it something maybe during the heat of passion?  Were they planning it?  Yes, they were.  Oh, so they were banging for a kid.  You son of a bitch.  So there's different positions that work better, I think.  You know, we're going to have fight club, you and I.  Doggy style?  Shut up.  Was she peering around over her shoulder, looking at her, uh...  Yes, this is supposed to be a happy and proud moment for my kid.  I know.  I'm just saying.  You're not stupid.  You know how it's done.  Well, for the...  People don't get pregnant by swallowing a watermelon seed. 
[00:04:00]  Your sister was, you know, getting some of the big beef injection.  Idiot.  You know, you add an egg, plus a little love snot.  And what you get is a child.  Hey, douche.  Listen to me.  I'm stepping out of character today to show a little class.  I have to represent my whole family here today.  Most of my family are finding out for the first time that my lovely sister, Holly,  and her husband, Mike, had a kid. 
[00:04:30]  They don't want it described in that way.  I'm sorry about that.  I got aunts and uncles and cousins all over the tri-state area listening to you right now, Anthony.  I'm really, really sorry about that.  I mean, we could be rude and crude right after I make this birth announcement, okay?  But I'm stepping out of character here to wish Holly and Mike...  Yeah.  Mike's the guy that's slamming her, right?  You son of a bitch.  You know, she is very fertile.  Maybe he's just got a good technique.  I hear, like, the ankles behind the ears. 
[00:05:00]  Shut up!  Cut it out!  I can't have this.  Don't turn my mic off.  Come on.  We made a pact where we don't turn off each other's mics, but I can't have this today.  It's a very special day, you ass.  Okay, sorry.  My sister flew in from Florida.  Yeah?  Hasn't heard this radio show in a year.  She hasn't heard this. 
[00:05:30]  All right.  I just thought, as soon as you knew...  My other sister, of course.  ...how, you know, babies are made.  Yeah, I figured it out.  You don't send a little letter to the stork and he brings a baby.  No, I figured...  Someone's got to get a pounding by a...  I understand.  That someone was your sister just getting slammed.  I know how babies are made because your mom taught me.  Now, relax.  You're a son of a bitch.  I'm sorry.  I didn't know. 
[00:06:00]  You get so upset.  All right.  Can I make the birth announcement?  Go right ahead.  I will shut up.  Congratulations to my sister, Holly, and Mike for having a bouncing baby girl.  A girl.  Jamie Lee.  All right.  Jamie Lee.  She can grow up and get a bang like...  Shut up!  Hey, Rick.  Rick, stay out of it because I'll tell everyone what I did to your sister this morning. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, my God.  Didn't you do something with her yesterday morning?  Yes, I did.  Why are you bowing to him, you ass?  You know why they're bowing to me and you know why...  You know why Rick is laughing?  Because you usually dish this out.  I know.  It gives it back to you.  I understand that.  I understand.  Go ahead.  Turn the microphones off.  No, all right.  Go ahead.  Have your fun.  Go ahead.  I won't turn off the rest. 
[00:07:00]  Oh, my God.  Holy God.  You better run.  You know, I wasn't going there.  You better run.  You don't have your little cute little suit on today.  I'll kick you right in your nuts.  Oh, let's go right there.  Dude, I'm not even going to waste my time with you.  If Spaz can beat you up, why should I bother?  Well, you lost some fights, too, tough guy.  Dude, Spaz beat you up.  That's all I have to say.  Spaz.  Who asked him twice as much?  Spaz.  He's 125 pounds soaking wet.  He beat you up.  He beat you up.  No.  So, wow. 
[00:07:30]  Opie, obviously, very strong feelings for a family and his sister.  We have to stick together.  All right.  I'm sorry.  If you want to continue, I'm going to break out Worst of CD number 35.  Oh, no.  And replay something we're not allowed to replay anymore.  Go ahead.  Let's see how brave you are.  Let me see what it is.  You know what it is. 
[00:08:00]  I don't know what it is.  You want me to write it down?  Yeah, write it down.  Oh, that one.  Ow.  Yeah.  That'll leave a mark.  Do you want to continue?  Hey, you know, that's totally not fair.  Why?  Because that wasn't me saying, let's not play that.  Right.  You know, that was my mom.  All right.  But, you know, you are saying, knock it off. 
[00:08:30]  Now, if Holly called up and said that she was angry about what she was hearing.  Knowing my sister, she's mortified.  She doesn't even listen to our radio show.  Thank God.  She's the only one in my whole family that doesn't listen.  How could she find time to listen when she's getting banged by her husband?  Shut up!  Oh, sorry.  I didn't mean that.  Rick, stop laughing.  Rick's just loving this.  Stop laughing. 
[00:09:00]  Look at him.  Even Spaz is laughing.  Look, look at him.  How can you be upset?  You set him up with that one.  I was trying to have a nice moment.  I stepped out of character.  Wanted to give a birth announcement before we started the festivities today.  I understand.  I felt like sharing with everyone my joy and excitement that my family is feeling today.  Uncle O'Connor.  And you wrecked it.  I'm sorry.  You wrecked it.  I just, I was taking your lead and the things I've heard you say in the past about other people and their relationships. 
[00:09:30]  And you've seen my brother-in-law, Mike.  He will kick your ass.  How would he find time while he's banging your fist?  Relax, Rick.  It's not that funny.  Oh, no, it is.  Relax.  It's not that funny.  Ken, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  You know what?  You deserve every bit of it, man.  For what you did to Rick that time. 
[00:10:00]  I got to tell you.  Why?  Rick beat the crap out of me after everything I said.  I could just picture it now.  How he's there saying, Mike, throw your...  Oh, look at how he hangs up on him.  Wow, you are very defensive.  It's my sister.  No, I respect that.  That's good.  All right.  That's very nice.  Spaz, you want a beating?  Gary, what's up?  What's going on?  How you guys doing?  You guys killing me today. 
[00:10:30]  All right.  Cretan in Spaz.  Hey, Anthony.  Yeah.  What's the matter, man?  What are you doing to Opie?  Opie thinks that his sister is Doris Day, man.  I know.  I understand.  Opie.  Here we go.  Hey, Opie.  Yeah.  Doris Day used to bend over and grab her ankles, man.  You guys wrecked it.  You know that they tape these birth announcements from one of my sisters or brothers has a kid?  Do they?  And then they play them every year and stuff.  This is what they're going to get to hear for the next 25 years? 
[00:11:00]  Gee, I'm sorry I wrecked it like that.  Patricia, what's up?  You guys are so mean to him.  What?  You are so mean.  You guys are big-ass you to you guys.  Anthony, you're being so horrible right now.  How?  Well, what am I doing?  Oh, he's just so cruel.  Arthur's trying to be, like, sincere.  I mean, you're ranking on his sister.  That's like, that's taboo. 
[00:11:30]  Yeah, we don't rank on sisters around here.  Oh, yeah, right.  You're always talking about banging my sister.  I don't want to hear that.  And wait, did somebody call your sister a hula?  A hula.  I love it.  There is only a small section of New York that you will ever hear whore said like that in the world.  I hear what?  Somebody call her a hula.  I don't say it like that.  Where are you from?  Like, where the hell are you from?  Listen, I don't say who. 
[00:12:00]  I say whore or hoe, baby.  Hoe.  Where are you from?  I'm from New York.  South Shore?  Born and raised.  Long Island?  No.  You really want to know?  Queens.  Oh, Queens?  Queens says hoo-a?  Queens says hoo-a.  I didn't know that.  I left a story a long time ago.  Well, I wasn't from Astoria, but...  Now they say whore.  Now they say hoo-a, hoo-a.  How do they say whore in Greek? 
[00:12:30]  I don't know.  But baby.  All right.  Well, thank you for sticking out for me, Patricia.  Oh, I love you.  You guys are great.  All right.  Are you happy?  Uncle Ope.  You happy for my sister?  Of course.  Okay.  Jamie Lee, everyone.  My sister.  I love that name.  My sister's new kid.  Jamie Lee.  You guys have a great weekend.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  I'm waiting for one of my brothers to call to kick your ass, because they're not going  to be as nice as I am.  I don't know.  That's just a little odd.  Ken, what's up?  That's so defensive. 
[00:13:00]  All right.  Uncle Ope.  Yeah.  Listen, you see, I don't understand.  You get the power, and now you start hanging up on people?  See?  That's not right.  I know.  You believe him?  No.  Ann was hanging up on people.  No.  Come on.  You dish it out to everybody.  You should be able to take it once in a while.  I could take it, but I know my sister can't.  She's mortified right now.  But you know what?  And she'll call up.  Wait.  Well, Mike will call up.  And you'll tell him, that's the deal, just like we did with Anthony and his mother.  Oh, look at that. 
[00:13:30]  Oh, yeah, Ann.  Okay.  You know, I see what's going to happen today.  All right.  Obviously, Ann couldn't take your statement.  He had to dump it out of it.  Okay.  I see where we are today, Ann.  But wait.  Isn't it an open forum?  Well, I thought until I saw Ann reach for that button.  It is.  You see, if everybody else had a dump button, they wouldn't be listening.  That's why we're all listening.  All right.  You know?  Thank you, Ken.  Take care.  All right.  Bye. 
[00:14:00]  Lewis, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Opie?  All right.  Can you send my request to your sister and my kid?  Oh, my God.  All right.  Look.  Look.  Cut it out.  All right.  Rick, cut it out.  You had fun.  You guys had 20 minutes of fun.  No, it's only been 12.  You've been keeping track, right?  Anyway, my sister had a kid today.  Thanks, Rick. 
[00:14:30]  That's good.  Very nice.  Only 18 years until she's legal.  She's son of a bitch.  What?  I'm glad you said that night.  F you, a-hole.  F you.  Oh, look.  I had Psycho Mark just laughing in the other room.  F you, a-hole.  Come on, Opie.  18 years.  F you, a-hole.  I thought we were all having fun.  What happened? 
[00:15:00]  Psycho Mark coming in and going 18 years all excited.  Sorry, Mark.  She didn't have a boy.  Jesus, man.  This is getting really ugly.  Look at Spaz.  Oh, Spaz.  Oh, my God.  Oh, man.  He stopped doing it.  Wait, wait.  Dude, I would keep...  I would...  Oh, Fight Club.  I can't because of my eyes.  I have two more days left.  My eyes.  They're going crazy.  Can't do anything. 
[00:15:30]  You're a loser.  I swear to God, I can't do crap for two more days.  No, you can take him easy.  F you, a-hole.  Oh, my God.  Can we take a break?  Hmm?  Can we take a break?  Oh, yeah, sure.  All right.  Well, congrats, Holly and Mark.  Yes, congratulations.  I'm sending my congratulations.  Can I do this so at least they can play, like, maybe 10 seconds of this tape 10 years from now?  All right, go ahead.  You won't hear a word from me. 
[00:16:00]  Don't laugh.  I won't even laugh.  Congratulations to my sister, Holly.  And her husband, Mike.  On their bouncing baby girl, Jamie Lee.  Okay?  Okay.  What are you getting ready over there?  Go ahead.  Play it.  Go ahead.  I didn't say anything.  All right.  I said I wasn't going to say anything.  All right.  We'll be back with the program.  212-757-1027 if you want in.  Fax line 212-957-9639. 
[00:16:30]  Opie.  Keep your hands away from your pants.  Too late.  And Anthony.  I'm disappointed.  And more stupidity on the way.  102-7-WNAW.  It's FU Friday with Opie and Anthony on 1027-WNAW.  Hello.  Fax line 212-957-9639 if you want to get your FUs in today.  And, of course, you can do it live on the phone. 
[00:17:00]  212-757-1027.  Let's go to Danny.  Danny, what's going on?  Yeah, I want to give a big F to you to Will Penn Darvish.  Why do you want to mention his name?  Because he was on.  Yesterday, I was listening to him, and he was talking about you guys.  So?  So?  Everyone else is.  Why not him?  Everyone else is.  Right.  I don't know.  I just think he's a douchebag.  Well, he's below us now.  We don't even acknowledge he exists.  It was fun messing with him for what?  I think that battle took exactly two and a half hours to win. 
[00:17:30]  So let him talk about us.  Whatever.  All right, guys.  I just want to let you know.  All right.  See you later.  Surprised he has time to talk with all those 92-minute rock blocks.  92-minute rock blocks.  Yeah, rock.  That makes you feel good if you're a DJ and your boss tells you to play 92-minute rock blocks over and over again.  Yeah.  Really gives me an opportunity to tell my personality.  Yeah, with a 92-minute rock block.  The same crusty tunes we've been playing for the last eight months.  Have fun. 
[00:18:00]  Anyway, Anthony.  Very happy.  On to other things.  It's a very happy day for my family, obviously.  Yes.  With my sister.  I'm leading to something here because we're going to move on to other things with my sister having a daughter today, Jamie Lee.  Get out of here, a-hole.  We're done for now.  But, Anthony, did you hear the big news?  Aw.  Little Jamie Lee now. 
[00:18:30]  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's okay.  What?  I'm just playing babies now.  That's all.  All right.  You're not going to do anything over the top over there, are you?  No, because I have some limits on things I say, unlike some people around here.  All right.  You sure?  Positive.  Okay.  I'm not going to insult your family's happy moment.  Anthony, did you read about Celine Dion in the paper today? 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  Everyone waiting for our comments on Celine Dion.  It's being reported in the papers today that she is pregnant with twins, Anthony.  Woo!  Now, one paper is saying that she's pregnant with twins.  The other is saying it's false.  It's not true.  So, I would like to think that it is true and that Celine Dion is pregnant with twins, Anthony.  With twins.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What, did they freeze her husband's sperm or something? 
[00:19:30]  Did you see that?  He has cancer, so they froze his sperm, and she was impregnated with her husband's frozen sperm.  Yeah.  I guess because what kind of cancer does he have that he can't just give her the high, hard one and do it that way?  Well, they wanted to, you know, make sure they were going to have kids.  Right.  With no good.  Well, that's something.  His sperm live on.  What the world?  I am pregnant. 
[00:20:00]  Finally.  We have been trying for so long to get pregnant.  And finally, my husband's sperm slammed into my egg.  Much like the mighty Titanic slammed that iceberg.  Splitting it open and fertilizing an egg to make another Celine, hopefully.  Hopefully, my legacy will live on, as will my camel toe.  It is such a happy moment for my 58-year-old husband, Rene, when he found out I was pregnant with twins. 
[00:20:30]  Do you know, twin hippos could fit side by side in my camel toe.  But these are just twin babies.  All of the sperm that was swimming around in the icy waters of my uterus.  Do you know most of them die?  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  Most of the sperm never make it.  Correct.  They die there in the icy waters of my uterus.  But two, two sperms lived on, swam, swimming, using all of their might to find the egg.  The egg to cling to.  These sperms are the one that fertilized the eggs.  While the others died, these sperms were true survivors.  Do you know, my twin children can grow to adulthood and still fit out of my camel toe. 
[00:21:30]  That huge crevasse between my legs.  You should see.  Do you know the reason it had to be artificial insemination? 
[00:22:00]  I don't know why.  They say because Rene had cancer and they froze his sperm and put it in.  But the truth of the matter is, he could not even feel the sides of my mighty camel toe.  I am so huge.  He kind of slammed it against the side a couple of times, but it did not work.  So they made the sperm popsicle.  Now this frozen sperm, was it as blue as...  Yes. 
[00:22:30]  As blue as DiCaprio at the end of Titanic?  Yes.  That's what they looked like, this sperm, frozen, like Leo at the end of Titanic.  My sperm will go on.  It was like having an ice pop in there. 
[00:23:00]  The frozen sperm of my husband Rene.  But I can have twins now.  And I will dress them in little jumpsuit suits to show off their tiny little camel toes.  Just like mommy.  My camel toe will live on.  My camel toe will go on.  All right. 
[00:23:30]  It's a happy day for Celine and Rene.  Yes.  Congratulations.  Celine.  Pregnant with twins.  Boy, that's got to be something for the OBGYN checking her out.  All right.  Celine, hop up on the table.  All righty.  Why don't we take a look of...  Oh, my.  Look at the size of that.  Let's just...  Oh, hello.  Echo.  Celine. 
[00:24:00]  Wow, you've got a lot of room in here.  Yeah, let me...  You know, I don't even need instruments.  I'm just going to crawl right in and take a look around firsthand.  We don't need a sonogram or anything.  Wow.  Here, deep inside Celine's womb.  Look at the size of this place.  Is anyone in here?  In here.  In here.  In here.  Pinocchio.  Pinocchio. 
[00:24:30]  It's freezing in here.  It's like a Venus flysnatch.  You've got to watch out.  Scoop me right up.  Where the hell's the light switch in here?  It's pitch black.  Oh, my God.  Woo!  God damn.  What's that, trout? 
[00:25:00]  Just going to climb way up here.  Yeah, I could open up a water park in here.  People could just slide right back out.  Wherever you are.  I'm playing the snatch flute.  Wow. 
[00:25:30]  Oh, my God.  What is that?  Oh, my God.  It's a T-Rex.  What the hell's that doing in here?  What the hell's that doing in here?  I'm just walking over here.  Oh, my God.  It's disgusting.  Hey, who the hell's that sitting there?  Woo!  Buddy Edson?  What are you doing in Celine's womb?  Oh, my God.  Look, it's that little Kittner boy from Jaws.  It wasn't a shark after all. 
[00:26:00]  You're swimming.  You got sucked up by Celine's shoes.  Hey.  There's another walk over here.  Can we see who's in here?  Can we see your stuff?  Oh, Pete.  Hey, how you doing?  I don't know.  All right.  We're just going to go for a little pap smear here.  You might feel a little pressure.  There we go.  We've got enough of that.  All right.  I've got to get out of here. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, my God.  This place is huge.  Hold that.  It's coming right for us.  Don't even know what it was.  Better safe than sorry.  Oh, very good. 
[00:27:00]  We've got to do a little bowling.  I see a light.  Oh, my God.  It's a tractor trailer in Celine's womb.  Oh, there it is.  It's a little baby.  Look at the camel toe.  Can you walk out of her womb and step out of her pants, please? 
[00:27:30]  I'm going to get out of here.  All right.  Just coming out to the other cage here.  What's that about around the corner?  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  I feel much better.  Hey, what's coming after me?  Is that an Apache attack helicopter?  All right, well, there you have it. 
[00:28:00]  Celine having a twin.  Congratulations.  Congratulations to Celine and her husband there.  Maybe that's where the CBS FM broadcasts from, Celine's womb.  With that, let's take a break.  We'll be back in just a bit here.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show, screwing off once again, absolutely, on this fine FU Friday. 
[00:28:30]  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  The fax line is 212-957-9639.  Opie and Anthony.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from her private area.  More stupidity on the way.  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Phone line, 212-757-1027.  It's FU Friday. 
[00:29:00]  Hey, guys.  I want to say a big FU to Sean Hannity because he bashed you guys for winning the afternoon award show.  Really?  If he wants the award that bad, we'll have Spaz walk it over to the radio show.  Take it over.  Put a piece of masking tape over our names and you can write it up.  It's no big honor.  If you really need it that bad, we'll walk it over to you right now.  Yeah.  All right. 
[00:29:30]  Let's get to some FUs.  Brian, what's going on today?  Yeah.  Well, I just saw my girlfriend and my best friend today in school.  I was in school and I was walking down the hallway and I stole my girlfriend.  He came from my best friend.  So I ran over there and kicked his ass.  Oh, yeah.  I want to give a big FU at my friend.  Actually, my ex-friend now, Ryan.  So your best friend stole your girl and you beat the crap out of him. 
[00:30:00]  Yeah.  It happens.  It happens all the time.  Yeah.  Well, it was like that other guy who got beat up by the guy who stole the girl.  Right.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks very much, guys.  Well, thanks for sharing.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, yeah.  We got to talk about this guy.  Ken, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  How are you?  Hey, did you watch Millionaire last night?  Rick was telling me.  Rick, grab a mic. 
[00:30:30]  I heard there was a guy in last night that lost.  First question.  First question.  First question.  The first questions are made for, like, kindergarten kids that are watching the show.  The nursery run.  The most pathetic look on the guy's face after he lost.  And you should have seen Regis.  What a stupid bastard, Gelman.  I can't believe it.  Well, it was brown after that.  Well, Ken, explain what happened.  Well, it was, uh, you ever hear that little nursery run?  Little Jack Horner sat in the corner.  Right.  Well, the answers were pulled out a plum, uh, blackbirds, and two other ones. 
[00:31:00]  So he just thought he pulled out a plum is supposed to be the answer.  Right.  What did he pull out?  He pulled out blackbirds.  And he was confident on that.  Yeah.  The guy was, like, cocking and stuff.  He's like, he goes, are you nervous?  He goes, oh, no, nobody's watching me, Regis.  Are you nervous?  They don't even comment on it.  They went right to commercial, and they're like, they didn't even say anything about it.  Oh, dude, dude, they did.  Didn't you watch Regis?  He was freaking out over it. 
[00:31:30]  Regis was just like, he, as soon as he heard the guy's answer say blackbird, Regis just  pops his head up like a chicken, like, huh?  What?  And he starts pulling at his collar, like, and looking at the guy, like, uh, are you  sure?  Are you positive?  That's your final answer.  He didn't even get to that part.  That's your final answer, you stupid buffoon.  What?  This time's a deal.  You're dumber than Kathy Lee.  And the guy was adamant about his answer.  What a jerk off.  He didn't win no money.  Zero. 
[00:32:00]  He was certain it wasn't a plum.  He was certain.  And Regis afterwards, he goes, well, that's never happened before.  Our first loser.  Loser.  I mean, didn't get the first question right.  Didn't get the first, first line question.  Like Ralph Cramden on the $64,000 question.  Remember that one?  I will forge ahead to the $64,000 question.  And he, like, misses the first one.  Popular music.  His answer was, Ed Norton. 
[00:32:30]  Who wrote Swamy River?  Ed Norton.  Yeah, but Regis was all freaked out last night, huh?  And the kid was young.  He was, like, 24.  So you know he's going back to his friends like, you loser.  You know?  Because it's just like, he's just going to get pounded for years on that one.  Man.  Oh, too funny.  I'm bummed I missed that one.  What an asswipe!  Regis was so surprised, man.  That's classic.  First question.  Hello?  What's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  I saw Stephen Lynch last night at Rascal's, the West Orange. 
[00:33:00]  Funny guy.  Awesome show.  Yeah.  It was even better live than hearing him on the radio because he had the coolest facial expression.  Yeah.  I mean, the whole act is great.  I mean, we always recommend you guys go check out Stephen Lynch when he's in the area.  Yeah.  He was great.  Cool.  He plugged you guys a couple times, too.  Well, we definitely appreciate that.  Yeah.  We're all good buds around here.  Mm-hmm.  Um, how was the crowd?  Pretty good?  Eh, it was a little empty.  Not really empty, but, I don't know, really bad snow.  I sat in two and a half hours of traffic to get there. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  It was a horrible night last night.  Uh, it was, there was a couple tables empty, but it was pretty full.  Cool.  It was a good crowd.  Well, I'm glad you had a good time.  All right.  Thank you, Kathleen.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Larry, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Hey, Larry, you're up.  Hey, it's me, man.  Hey.  Hey, I was watching Regis last night, and, uh, when he, after the guy,  missed the answer, he goes, hey, uh, you know, I was just thinking,  I kept thinking about Blackbird, and Regis goes,  uh, you're done, you can't answer anymore. 
[00:34:00]  So, uh, then Regis goes, oh, the guy was just a buffoon.  Yeah.  He was like a kid.  He was about 20 years old.  Kathy Lee's cans have a higher IQ than you.  Oh, my God.  She was brawless this morning.  Really?  Oh, that is just a scary sight.  You know, I've been reading the stories in the paper and stuff,  but I never saw it for myself in hell this morning.  Oh, my God.  Yeah, they're way down like that.  She still thinks she's like this young, nubile chick, 
[00:34:30]  and she's, uh, definitely up there in years, getting there, you know?  She shouldn't be wearing no bra, because those things are sagging.  And, like, they look like, like you say, socks filled with sand.  Fill up tube socks full of sand.  And turn them, like, sideways, too.  Yeah, man.  They had some kind of banana thing happen.  What the hell's going on in your dress, Kathy Lee?  It's like you got a couple of aliens coming out of your body.  Man, I finally saw it for myself today.  I could not believe what I was looking at.  Yeah.  She does that. 
[00:35:00]  No one is telling her that, you know, you're a little too old for this.  Who's going to tell her that?  She'll probably have you fired, you know?  You walk up by Kathy Lee and just, like, tell you maybe you're a little, you know,  maybe you should wear something a little more flattering to your figure.  Mm-hmm.  What do you mean?  Well, your boobs are hanging like sweat socks full of sand.  Oh.  All right, let's take a break.  We got to play Regis Goes Hollywood from the ONA Archives, and we'll be back.  Stay there.  I don't need that bitch anymore.  Whoa, Regis.  I'm a popular man.  Regis, what's up? 
[00:35:30]  My new show, Millionaire.  Yeah, it's all over the paper.  I'm huge, Gilman.  I don't have to sit next to that droopy can bitch.  Regis, you going Hollywood on us?  I've always been Hollywood.  It's the real Regis coming out.  You're bigger than ever these days.  I'm huge.  With that game show of yours.  Huge.  Huge, yes.  Gilman, bring me Coca-Cola.  Your lifestyle changing a little bit?  It's always been wild.  Yeah.  But now I don't have to hide it.  Yeah.  I used to go to Westbury Music Fair.  Yeah.  And sing and pick bimbos from the audience. 
[00:36:00]  And bang them backstage.  You've seen the Motley Crue documentaries.  Yeah.  I send Gilman out for bimbos.  Gilman, there's a young girl of 50 or 60.  Pop your teeth out, you whore.  Tongue it.  Tongue it.  I'll lick the Geritol off your ass.  Gilman, there's one in the front row.  Give her a heart monitor and send her back here.  I love old Gash. 
[00:36:30]  You're just going Hollywood.  I love it.  Getting the groupies from the show.  I'm big now.  I'm getting ratings.  Yes, you are.  That slut bear Kathy Lee.  I don't need her.  No, you don't.  Bend her over that coffee table on the live show.  She's not wearing a bra these days.  All those things would hit the floor.  I'll can't have her.  Wow.  Come on.  That's the question on tomorrow's Millennium 2000 trivia question.  Oh, yeah?  We do every morning.  All right.  What's the question?  Where am I going to ask Kathy Lee?  Right in the cans. 
[00:37:00]  You see those things?  I could do that and then tie them in a knot.  Tomorrow's guest, Dirty Sanchez on the show.  Is that a Christian musical group or something?  No, it's the Dirty Sanchez.  Make Kathy Lee look like the Frito Bandita.  Hoor!  Bury it deep, you hoor! 
[00:37:30]  No wonder we have no ladies listening to our show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Grown men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  It's FU Friday.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  Let's go right back to the phones and talk to Mike.  Mike, what's going on today?  Hey, what's up, man? 
[00:38:00]  I was watching TRL.  There's some guy trying to copy Psycho Mark.  What is he doing?  He's got the orange sign.  He's got a sign.  He's doing a poor, poor, it's an orange sign with, like, very thin, 10-year-old, wow.  Oh, cool.  He's trying to do it right now.  And he's, like, jumping up.  He's doing a better job than Psycho Mark, man.  He's jumping like crazy.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  Well, that's what we're looking for.  We're looking for other people to take the lead that Mark has put out there.  We're looking for, what was the word? 
[00:38:30]  It was mutations of Psycho Mark.  Clones.  Not even clones, like, uh, the spawn.  Yeah, we want, uh, yeah, Psycho Mark spawns to, uh, you know, just flash wow signs anytime  you see a live, uh, TV shot going on.  Yeah.  And where is the guy?  Is he in the street and stuff?  Yeah, he's in the street.  He's, uh, right behind, there's this, uh, some girl, Dub Brat, that's hosting it.  Yeah.  And he's right behind him on the left.  Oh, cool.  He's jumping like crazy.  Yeah, put it on.  All right, we'll check it out for ourselves.  There's, like, there's people, there's people helping him jumping out with him, too. 
[00:39:00]  So, he's got, he's got, like, eight people with him.  He's got a big crowd.  Ah, right on.  This is what we want to see.  We want to take over the city.  Every time they do a live show, we want someone behind the, the news person, you know, with  a wow sign or something that has to do with the, the, the radio show.  Yeah.  You don't need WWF.  You got the crowd.  There you go.  All right, man.  All right, thank you, man.  All right, man.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  We got him.  Is that him?  No?  Uh, we don't see anyone behind her right now.  De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.  This would be really cool if people aren't taking Psycho Mark's lead, though. 
[00:39:30]  Yeah.  We had a hell of a week, I got to say.  I mean, we forgot that Psycho Mark was all over MTV this week.  Yeah.  With the wow sign.  Like crazy.  There's clips of it on the unofficial O.P. and Anthony website.  And, uh, we were talking to Psycho Mark in our office.  Is that cool?  He's got something planned that is just going to be the atom bomb.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I don't even know if we can take credit for this when it happens. 
[00:40:00]  Is it your idea?  Yeah, we were talking about it last night.  Don't even say what it is, because it's going to be a complete surprise to everyone when it happens.  But that was your idea?  Yeah, yeah.  Oh, my God.  It is, uh, it is an atom bomb, isn't it?  If it happens, and we're not going to say when or where, would you just laugh until you vomited if you saw that?  And I think, officially, it would be the funniest thing I've ever, ever seen on TV.  Absolutely.  Without a doubt. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Without a doubt.  That's all we can say.  But we can't tell you when or where it's going to happen.  But if he pulls this off, and let me tell you something.  It's very, very possible that he will pull this off.  Oh, hell yeah.  And if he does, it will be a huge national story.  Huge.  I mean, it'll be bigger than big.  Yeah, that's all we can really say.  And I think we'll be on vacation.  Yeah, right?  That's why we can't acknowledge that we had anything to do with it. 
[00:41:00]  No.  No.  Who are we?  There's somebody out there with a sign.  It's a brilliant idea.  I wish we could say something now, but we would wreck it.  Yeah.  We would definitely wreck it.  Yeah.  But if he pulls this off, holy crap.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, how you doing, Uncle Opie?  Congratulations there.  Hey, thank you.  Hey, yeah, you guys see that clip of Rick and Mark with all the suit on, the cushioned suit on?  Yeah.  On foundyourmusic.com there?  Yeah, we didn't talk about that yesterday. 
[00:41:30]  It was going on in the studio.  Oh, it was hilarious, man.  I thought when he threw Rick against the, when he threw Mark against the record rack right there,  I thought all the CDs were going to come down.  It's so funny, man.  It was something that was going on, you know, while we were doing our radio show that we'd  never even commented on, but Psycho Mark was in riot gear, and Rick was beating the crap  out of him.  Yeah, it's funny.  Throwing him into the CD rack and jumping on top of him, and it's on the unofficial website.  It was great, guys.  Cool.  Keep it up, man.  Thank you, Joe. 
[00:42:00]  Where else do you want to go?  Oh, yeah, we'll go there in a sec.  Len, what's going on?  Yeah, did any of you guys see CD's early edition this morning?  No.  They were doing a piece about, like, teen movie stars and how they're in all the different  movies, and they cut to a clip of Freddie Prinze Jr. hosting TRL, and they had, all you see  is, what's his face, Psycho Mark dancing in the background.  With the wow sign, right?  So if anyone saw it this morning, just ask, so they can verify it.  That's hilarious.  That's beautiful.  All right, later, guys.  Thank you, Len. 
[00:42:30]  Too funny.  People want to guess what Mark will do.  This is dangerous, because we want this one to happen.  We share everything with you guys.  We share too much, because half the time, I'll open my stupid mouth, and a bunch of things  haven't happened, because I spoke too soon.  Yeah.  So that's the only reason why we can't tell you yet.  John, what's up?  John?  Yeah.  You want to guess what Mark's going to do?  Yeah.  All right, go ahead.  Is he going to moon the camera?  It's much bigger than that. 
[00:43:00]  Much bigger than that.  That's all I'm going to say.  I've got to hang up, okay?  Did you guys lose your job over it?  Uh, no.  Ah, come on.  I don't think so.  You guys are great.  Take it easy.  It depends what TV station he chooses.  Yeah.  But I'm guaranteeing it will be huger than huge.  When is he going to try to pull this off, you think?  I don't know.  We ought to do it soon, though.  It's got to be bigger than the wow.  You know what I mean?  Um, yeah. 
[00:43:30]  Like twice the size.  Yeah.  Black on white.  Oh, my God.  It'll horrify people.  Oh, my God.  It will absolutely horrify people.  I can't believe you thought of that one, Eric.  Oh, yeah.  It's great.  It's definitely great.  Gabe, you're next.  What's going on?  Not much.  All right.  Hey, uh, I want to give a big F you someone.  Yeah, go ahead.  F you to that damn Cuban kid. 
[00:44:00]  I hate him.  The rat boy?  Yeah, I hate him.  He's very popular.  His grandparents are coming over now.  Take him away.  I think we should just send him back.  Exactly.  It's a big deal.  He's pained in the ass.  I feel sorry for him, though, because a year from now, he's going to be all screwed up  in the head.  I feel sorry for him because they don't really care about his, uh, you know, the feelings  of the kid.  It's just a whole political mess is what it has become.  Yeah.  It's Cuba against the United States.  Right.  Learn about Cuba.  Eating some food.  Hey, the ironic thing is my last name is Castro. 
[00:44:30]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  No kidding.  You're a commie.  You got a big beard?  Yeah, I do.  Yeah?  Heard of a snatch.  Too much information, Gabe.  That's funny.  Thank you.  No problem.  All right.  Everyone is guessing what Mark's going to do.  It's pretty funny.  I'll just read them instead of going to the phones.  Mark on TV naked with wow sign.  Will Mark run on the field of the Super Bowl?  Anything is possible.  That's all we'll say.  Okay?  Yeah.  All right.  We got to play this for Raph Boy, and we'll be back. 
[00:45:00]  Drown, drown, Cuban, drown.  Drown, Cuban, drown.  Yeah, Cuban, drown, drown, drown.  Drown, Cuban, drown.  We're going to race.  Drown, drown, drown.  We're going to walk and walk around.  Drown, drown, drown.  You're moving on your way to USA.  Let's hear it for the refugees.  Give them a hand.  Broke the days just to open up a cycle stand.  When a Cuban flow on the one-bottle cork, 
[00:45:30]  Quantanamo Bay is just a five-minute walk.  Turn around.  We're going to go drown.  Cuban refugees.  We're going to Miami.  We took all your relatives a day away.  Remember Ricky Ricardo, Baba Blue, I ate.  Look at Mama Cedar, she's as big as a boat 
[00:46:00]  You'd shove a motor up a raft if you thought she'd float  Turn around, hold on, you won't drown  You'll learn your way  You won't say  You won't drown  Drown, drown, Cuban drown, document drown  Yeah  Cuban drown, drown, drown, document drown 
[00:46:30]  Hey, ass, turn down your radio.  1027 WNEW.  Rick is handing me a fax from Kim. 
[00:47:00]  Please send an F you to my husband, Tom, because his sperm was too retarded to find my egg last month.  Too retarded.  That's great.  I'm not pregnant.  Hopefully this month's batch will have enough intelligence to find the egg.  I also want to say happy fifth anniversary to my husband.  His retarded sperm.  His retarded sperm couldn't find Kim's egg this month.  How many millions of those things?  Millions, right?  Yes.  Every sperm is sacred, Anthony.  Aren't there ones that fight the other ones? 
[00:47:30]  Like they got the real strong one, smart one, and they're just swimming.  Right.  Kicking ass.  Sure.  Bouncing each other out of the way.  Sure.  And then all of a sudden, right up the middle.  I'm not going to get it.  No, no, no, no, no, no.  Like the other ones are duking it out.  Whizzing by.  Only to be knocked into the side of the womb.  Don't, don't, don't, slow and steady with four of you. 
[00:48:00]  Before you know it, a couple of years later, you're like,  Dimey!  What happened?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Quick musical break there.  Corn.  Falling away from issues.  Boom, man, before that.  It's FU Friday.  The facts keep rolling in here.  Yeah.  2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9. 
[00:48:30]  I don't know who sent this in, but it's a great one.  Hey, guys, here's a tidbit on how stupid the news is.  I was watching Fox News last night.  Their top story was the Seton Hall fire.  So they say, coming up, more info on the Seton Hall fire,  plus an exclusive interview with a student who slept through the whole ordeal.  Hello?  Can you imagine this interview?  Reporter.  So can you tell us what happened?  Student.  Well, I didn't really see much.  I was sleeping at the time.  Reporter. 
[00:49:00]  You heard it first here.  Back to you in the studio.  Wow, what an exclusive.  I had to turn off the TV later, Craig.  Could you ask him if he was asleep on his back or his stomach?  Yes, very good question.  The studio wants to know.  I love that when they do that follow-up question.  Yeah.  The guy got to put his finger in his ear,  find a little ear funding to hear the studio.  Yes, yes.  Okay, yes, I will ask him that.  Right.  Oh, shut up.  We passed on the kid that slept through the Seton Hall fire. 
[00:49:30]  Yeah.  We could have had him on our show, but.  Thank you.  I mean, what are you going to ask him?  What are you going to ask the kid?  Yeah, I kind of made the perfect point.  Yeah, how much weed did you smoke?  Yeah, how much bourbon did you drink before?  I don't know.  It was some kind of a, you know, frat thing.  Well, I had that.  I was pretty drunk.  I had that laser eye surgery, so I popped a few Valiums and slept through the whole damn thing.  It's the news.  They've got to get their own unique angle on everything.  No one's even worse than that.  And every station did it last night. 
[00:50:00]  The snow coverage.  Holy cow.  We're not retards out here when we're watching TV.  Did anyone call it Snowstorm 2000 yet?  Uh, Blizzard 2000.  See, I'm waiting for the Blizzard 2000.  Nor'easter 2000.  Blizzard of the millennium.  You know, it, like, sucks now.  They can't call anything of the century yet.  Because it's like the beginning.  I know.  Come on.  Give me a break.  Like, now it was like, all right, the OJ trial.  Trial of the century.  All right. 
[00:50:30]  It's pretty close to the end.  Yeah, pretty good odds no one was going to beat that one.  No one was going to beat that one.  Okay, now it's like, you know, Blizzard of the century.  It's O-O.  Right.  All right?  You're making a pretty big statement that in the next 99 years, this is not going to be something worse.  Yeah, but, I mean, if the TV stations are listening, we're not retards.  We don't go to work on the short bus with hockey helmets.  You know, something that's supposed to snow in January.  It's supposed to be very cold. 
[00:51:00]  They asked one guy how he was driving in the snow.  How are you driving in the snow?  What do you mean, how am I driving in the snow?  I thought today was a great day to see how fast my car could go.  Driving maybe a little slower.  And then obviously gives the answer, well, I'm taking a little extra caution out here, a little slippery, not going as fast, blah, blah, blah.  We here at the station recommend you take a little extra time getting where you have to, and don't drive unless you have to. 
[00:51:30]  Right.  So those aimless wanderings about the streets in your car, you know, count those out.  Don't drive unless you have to.  Isn't that when you drive anyway?  Right.  You know, I'm going to drive.  I don't have to, but I'm going to.  But I'm going to.  Just because I want to.  What's it, Jerks?  Have you checked any elderly lately?  Well, better than that, they go, and we suggest that you don't leave your pets outside.  It's going to be two degrees tonight.  Oh, gee, thanks for that one. 
[00:52:00]  Huh, was going to let little Fluffy out.  I thought he liked the frigid cold.  Let's go douse them in water and throw them outside.  Right.  Make a little stiff, little Fluffy sickle.  Every year.  Every year.  Same thing.  No apartment's a little cold.  And then they go to the hardware store, and they show you that there's no more snow shovels.  Everyone bought it for the big storm.  And snowblowers?  Forget about it.  All sold out here.  They were interviewing an older guy from Jersey who was, you know, snowblowing his driveway. 
[00:52:30]  It was hilarious.  Really?  How are you handling this?  Well, the snowblower's doing the job for me.  Yeah, pretty good.  Makes me feel young, the snow.  How are you doing today?  Yeah, pretty good.  I got a compressor sounding.  Snowblower.  Give me a snowblower sound, Rick.  My new apartment there, a little cold, a little concerned.  Went down to the landlord. 
[00:53:00]  Welcome to New York.  You think you're a special?  No, I know.  He never works in New York in the winter.  They're kind of the old type radiators, you know, in each room, the metal radiators.  Uh-huh.  And, uh, oh my God, at night, at night, here it is.  Yeah.  I didn't know we were having the guy from Police Academy in today. 
[00:53:30]  Thank you.  Yes, it's me now.  I'm just surprised you're so cold with all the effing you're doing lately.  Yeah.  Yeah, baby.  It's the only thing that protects me from the cold.  You know, nice warm body next to you.  That'll help.  What's his name?  Yeah, that's right, Rick.  Look in.  Didn't even bother.  What?  You didn't even bother with the you got me. 
[00:54:00]  It was just like.  Yeah, okay, Rick.  Whatever.  Mike, what's going on?  Mike?  Hey.  Hey, what's up?  All right.  I just wanted to chime in on what you're talking about, Andy, in terms of the recycled  stories.  You know, when I was growing up on Long Island, it was just effing cold.  There was no wind chill.  There was no ambient temperature.  You're absolutely right.  I mean, these guys, it is the exact same story from last winter.  They're going to try to come up with new stuff.  That's why they come up with, like, dew points and ambient temperature and wind chills and stuff 
[00:54:30]  like that.  You know, it's five degrees outside, or actually, yeah, it's 19 degrees on the thermometer,  but with the wind, it's going to feel like it's 10 below.  Well, what is it?  It doesn't matter.  I'm still freezing my ass off.  I don't care what you call it.  It'll feel like it will.  Do you think that when all the snow melts, we'll have a chance to solve our drought problem?  Mike, the funny thing, too, is why did the TV stations even bother going out to get 
[00:55:00]  new footage every winter, why don't you use the same footage and just update it every  10 years so the cars let you know?  Or when it was going to snow last week and it didn't, they ran all those January 96 videotapes.  Yeah.  Not what it could have looked like, but it did.  They could just run, yeah, old footage from New York.  It's like, why are the license plates orange?  How about Penny Cromwell?  Look at that.  In front of 800 pounds of sand.  I'm down here at the sand dunes.  Yeah, yeah, down here where the sanitation department is loading up sand to spread on the streets.  And then they have, like, the interview with Foreman. 
[00:55:30]  What are you going to be doing?  Well, we've got all the trucks out tonight.  We've got them all out.  They're all out there, you know, putting sand on the road.  Really?  I'd love to talk to you some more, but I've got to go check the ambient temperature outside.  You heard it here, putting sand on the road.  Back to you in the studio.  Well, thank goodness for them.  Vinny, you're next.  What's up?  Yeah, this morning, good to New York.  They closed the Big Chill 2000.  Big Chill 2000.  It's winter.  Victor, it's not a Big Chill 2000. 
[00:56:00]  Well, I mean, everything, you know, it's new to everybody, you know, snow, cold, you know.  It's January.  I don't know about you, but snow's not new to me anymore.  Been through it a few times.  Jesus Christ.  All right, thank you, Vinny.  All right, got to go back to work later.  Unbelievable.  Scott, what's going on?  Hey, buddy, what's going on?  Uh, not much.  Uh, listen, he's got a big FU out for you people who can't drive with bad weather this year.  Yeah.  And he's driving us crazy.  It's not even bad weather. 
[00:56:30]  Yeah.  A little snow in the heart?  Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.  Scott, call back.  Your phone sucks.  Sorry about that.  Let's go to Jimmy.  Jimmy, you're a cop?  Yeah.  What's going on?  Hello?  Hey, you're on, man.  You're on, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Oh, Jimmy, don't listen to the radio.  Listen.  I got, uh, got some guy holding himself hostage in the room here in Astoria.  And all those cops are freezing trying to clear the area. 
[00:57:00]  Get out of here.  Are you serious?  Serious.  He's holding, he's holding himself hostage?  And you're a guy holding himself hostage in Astoria.  One more step and the nigger gets it.  Remember that from Blazing Saddles?  Cleavon Little holding the gun to his head.  Remember that scene?  Go do what he's saying.  Go do what he's saying.  That was hysterical.  That poor man.  Somebody save him. 
[00:57:30]  Doug, what's up?  We got to play the Blazing Saddles clips again.  We got in a lot of trouble last time we did that.  But, Doug, what's up?  I saw a report of these guys.  Remember that snowstorm back, the big one in three feet, whatever we had at the time?  Yeah.  They ran out of something to run.  So they had this pinhead out there scraping ice off the van.  They're like, look, this is what you're doing.  They're banging the hood of the truck, getting the crap out of it, trying to get the ice off. 
[00:58:00]  I just wanted to jump through the TV and stab this person right in the eye.  So they were pretty much telling us how to scrape ice.  That's good.  Thank you.  They're out of control.  All right, man.  Thanks.  See you later, guys.  Bye.  They've run out of ways to talk about the winter weather.  That's what it is.  Every year it's the same thing.  But you need a real storm to even talk about it.  I'm sure we will have Blizzard 2000, whether it's a blizzard or not.  I think if we would have gotten, like, another inch of snow, they would have called it Blizzard 2000. 
[00:58:30]  They would have pulled out the Blizzard 2000 graphic?  Oh, pulled the new shiny 2000 graphic with snow blowing on it, you know?  Yeah.  Top story tonight, Blizzard 2000.  Socking in New York.  We go now to the talking head we put at Kennedy Airport, talking with the runway crews, how  they're keeping the runways clear.  Oh, too funny.  Enough.  All right, let's take a break, yeah?  I wanted to talk to Dan. 
[00:59:00]  Where's Dan?  Oh, no problem.  Dan, what's going on?  Hey, I went to the Nick game on Monday.  Yeah.  Star Jones was sitting courtside.  How many seats did she take up?  Well, she had Julianne Moore on one side, you know, the actress.  Sure.  And a little girl on the other side.  You could barely see them.  They had no chance of seeing the game.  She's a diva, though.  She's a diva.  Oh, they were creating their next round to try to see the court, and they just had no  chance.  Imagine you have, like, courtside seats to the next game, or one seat back. 
[00:59:30]  Yeah, I was going to say, second row.  You have second row seats.  You're so psyched driving in.  You're like, I can't believe I got second row to the next game.  You sit down.  It's great.  Game's ready to start.  All of a sudden, oh, you see a little commotion.  People are going, oh, look, maybe a celebrity's coming.  Maybe it's Spike Lee or something.  I'll get to see a scene be made right in front of me.  Maybe it's a big celebrity that I'm going to see. 
[01:00:00]  And then, oh, my God, it's Star Jones.  She's, like, walking onto the court and plops her fat ass right in front of you.  There's a little girl to her right hand.  It was just dork.  You could barely see her.  Now you can't see anything.  Big, like the Knicks score, and she jumps up, and her arm fat is in your way, just flabbing.  Did you see the size of her arms in the Daily News the other day? 
[01:00:30]  Yeah, they had a great picture of it.  Oh, my God.  It looked like the, uh.  They're bigger.  Her arms are bigger than my thigh.  Easily.  It was, like, more meat on there than that big thing they put on Fred Flintstone's car that tips it over.  That's what it looked like, a big chunk of, like, a Bronto burger.  That's what it was.  Yeah.  Her huge arm.  Yep.  And that was just an arm.  Like, her whole body's like that.  And then she goes on that show, The View, and she's calling herself a diva.  And they have, they have Star Beauty tips. 
[01:01:00]  Where she dresses in this, I swear I saw this, a black satin robe.  And she's laying on this, these satin sheets with candles on a bed.  Talking about how, how Star Jones does her diva beauty tips.  She's looking like Shamu.  She's, like, in this black satin robe.  I swear to God.  First thing I like to do is knock a little seal around with my tail.  I'll wipe it around the bed and fly it into my mouth.  Well, you know what?  We usually, we sit pretty high up. 
[01:01:30]  You usually need binoculars to figure out what celebrities are sitting down there.  You didn't need them for that game.  You knew who she was right off the bat.  It's just funny.  It was either Star Jones or a rerun from what's happening.  I couldn't figure out who it was.  All right, Dan.  Okay, thanks.  Thank you.  All right.  And they all kiss her ass on that show.  You know, oh, Star was on the cover of big, beautiful women.  Well, they're scared she's going to eat them this month.  Yeah.  She was on the cover and look at this, huh?  And the audience is, whoo, they're all clapping. 
[01:02:00]  Look at what a beautiful diva she is.  Well, honey.  And then she tries a little, you know, humor against herself, you know.  She's like, well, they touched this up a little bit.  I mean, what they do is airbrush out my freckles, the ones I didn't get with the spackle I apply in the morning.  And, of course, I'm wearing the special Star Jones diva wig because I got a crew cut under here.  I must be beautiful when I rip my clothes off in front of my man and I have to take my hair off. 
[01:02:30]  Star Jones.  Star Jones.  Yes.  They're in the view.  Star Jones comes cruising.  Thousand men into the water.  Ten men out.  Star Jones took the rest.  Look at that porker.  Look at the size of that porker.  You're going to go in that cage.  Cage goes in the water.  Star Jones in the water. 
[01:03:00]  Farewell and adieu to your fair Spanish lady.  I saw Star Jones in a rocking chair once.  Swallow your whole.  Little tenderizing.  Down you go.  Hey, Quince, would you like to go into Star Jones's gash?  Hooper?  Hooper, aren't you watching it?  Star Jones.  Can't go down with three barrels in it.  Hello. 
[01:03:30]  Like Star Jones gets up on the back of her Quince boat and Quince slides into her snatch.  Blood's coming out of her mouth.  I'll never wear a life jacket again.  On CBS.  Yeah, a lot of votes coming in for that as a bit of the week.  The CBS FM bit. 
[01:04:00]  Cool.  You can still vote for bit of the week.  I don't know.  What do you want to do with the whole rock thing from yesterday?  A lot of people saying that we came off looking really bad.  A lot of people sending in hate email about that.  Why?  A bunch of other people applauding us for standing our ground and not letting them into the show yesterday.  But, I mean, it is cringe radio at its best.  Yeah.  And I think the rock came across looking very, very good after the whole mess that was yesterday's show. 
[01:04:30]  Well, he's a company guy, you know.  In the best interest of the company, it was good for him to come up here and talk like a gentleman and apologize to people that promote the product, which is what we did.  He did explain himself.  I mean, a lot of people want to hear it again.  But we shan't plug that organization again.  Well, do we want to replay it, though?  Because it's good for our radio show.  We could do that, yeah, but it's not like we're plugging them or anything. 
[01:05:00]  All right.  Could you get that?  How long do you need?  Like 15 minutes.  Woo.  What?  No edits.  No, we don't need edits.  Yeah.  No problem.  We don't have to clean it up.  All right?  Yeah.  So we'll do that very soon.  And more of your phone calls, 212-757-1027.  Stay there.  Opie and Anthony Afternoon.  Mason and Kalinsky Mornings.  The Radio Chick Middays.  On 1027-WNEW. 
[01:05:30]  Hey, Anthony.  Yes?  We've got to welcome a brand new client to the Opie and Anthony Show.  All right.  Listen to the excitement in my voice for this live read.  I can only imagine who it is by the excitement in your voice, Opie.  Got to welcome Diamond Vision and, of course, Dr. Philatoff to the Opie and Anthony Radio Show.  This guy is like a...  He is a god in my eyes.  Amazing.  Opie had the procedure done.  I had LASIK.  LASIK.  With LASTECH. 
[01:06:00]  LASIK.  LASIK surgery.  Yes, you had LASIK surgery.  Yes.  I'm so excited.  I forgot what the procedure was called.  I apologize, Dr. Philatoff.  Yes.  And all...  You know something?  Opie doesn't even have to know the name.  All he knows is he can see.  It's on...  It's a modern-day miracle.  I mean, people are sick of me talking about how good my eyesight is now.  Yeah.  I mean, when we were walking around the city the other night at night, I could not believe  that the average person sees like this. 
[01:06:30]  He's walking around now just craning his neck trying to see everything.  Everything he hasn't seen in years.  He smashed his glasses.  Yeah, I smashed the glasses on Monday.  Glasses that are so freaking important to me, it's not even funny.  I wore glasses since I was in the third grade.  Glasses to me is like Viagra to like Hugh Hefner.  You know what I mean?  He's not leaving the house without his Viagra.  Okay?  That's how I was with my glasses.  Monday...  You'd take down if you didn't have your glasses. 
[01:07:00]  Monday, I came in here, two days after the procedure.  I'm seeing 2015.  Better than 2020.  Better than 2020.  I smashed my glasses on the air and I haven't looked back.  I had the surgery, what, six days ago?  Yeah.  No one could tell I had the surgery.  I don't even feel like I had the surgery.  There's no pain.  There's nothing.  I think it's weird even calling it surgery.  It's a procedure.  You know, because it doesn't even seem like that.  Eye procedure.  You came in, I saw you two days after, and you're like, look at my eyes. 
[01:07:30]  Look at my eyes.  You maybe get like an inch from your eye.  I was frightened.  Yeah, I know.  We usually don't do that to us.  No, we don't usually get that close.  Unless we're really, really drunk.  I looked right into your eyeball.  You are disgusting, man.  I looked right into your eyeball and didn't see any different than I saw for years.  Highly recommend this.  I was looking out our office window, reading signs like they were a couple blocks away.  I'm looking at, you know, water towers on the top of the buildings.  He's amazing. 
[01:08:00]  I almost got in an accident driving into work because I had to see the skyline for the first time in detail.  I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  And I had no problems with my night vision whatsoever.  My night vision sucked before the procedure.  Sucked.  And remember how scared I was a week ago?  You were petrified.  Absolutely petrified because I had been looking into the surgery for about a year.  Looked into a bunch of doctors.  And Dr. Philitoff made me feel very, very, very comfortable.  I went up there.  He has like three offices in Greenwich, Connecticut, Westport, Connecticut, and here in Manhattan. 
[01:08:30]  Talked to him.  By the time he talked to me, I was ready to go.  And, matter of fact, during the procedure, I was mellow, talking to him like it was no freaking big deal.  How about that?  Now you see fine.  You see better than people without glasses.  I'm like John Travolta.  Yeah.  Boy in the plastic bubble.  You finally got that out.  Remember when John got out of the bubble and enjoyed that day with his girlfriend and stuff?  Yes.  That's how I feel every day now.  It's like a whole freaking new world out there. 
[01:09:00]  I swear to God.  Boy in the plastic bubble.  I swear, though.  I'm very excited that they decided to advertise on our show because I'm very, very, very happy with this.  Okay?  Very good.  It's Diamond Vision with Dr. Philitoff.  The phone number, 1-800-984-2020.  Very easy number to remember.  1-800-984-2020 for Diamond Vision and Dr. Philitoff.  If you need that number, don't hesitate.  Please email me or give us a call here at the station.  Okay?  Right. 
[01:09:30]  1-800-984-2020.  1027-WNAW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  It's F.U. Friday.  Having a lot of fun today.  Oh, yeah.  Lots going on.  If you want to get in, we are taking your votes for Bid of the Week.  Looks like the CBS bid is in the lead right now, but a lot of fun and interesting things have happened on the show this week.  So if you want to get involved with that, that's very cool.  We like when you guys get involved with the radio show.  Oh, yeah.  You can send your F.U.s in through the fax line, 212-957-9639. 
[01:10:00]  That's very good, right?  Sure.  And I don't know.  We're going to replay The Rock's visit from yesterday before the end of the hour, hopefully.  Or right around 5.  As soon as Rick gets it together, it's going to take him a couple minutes.  I guess all the wrestling websites are talking about it and stuff.  Yeah, big news, of course.  And I don't know.  You know, a lot of people think we're dicks for what we did yesterday. 
[01:10:30]  And a lot of other people think it was cool that we stood up for something we believed in.  And you could decide for yourself.  Either way, whatever.  I thought The Rock came across pretty good, actually, yesterday.  Sounded like a gentleman, you know.  You know.  Could be just the corporate line that he was supposed to take.  Could be.  We don't know.  Yeah.  I accept his apology.  I accept his, you know, explanation that he gave yesterday.  Mm-hmm.  And I appreciate that he did that for us.  Not going to lie. 
[01:11:00]  Yeah.  What the hell is that?  What the hell do you got there, Mark?  Oh, it's Robin.  Oh.  Don't you have work to do?  Yeah, don't you have a spot to produce or something instead of walking around with a stern wig on?  Pathetic, man.  Oh.  All right.  Go away.  Graham, what's up?  Yeah, what's up, guys? 
[01:11:30]  All right.  How are you doing?  I'd just like to congratulate you guys on standing up to The Rock.  I think he's a piece of garbage, and you really showed him what's what.  I didn't understand what was going on.  Well, I don't think it was about us showing him anything.  It was just, you know, stating our case, and he stated his case, and then we didn't allow him into the studio.  But that was hilarious, man.  All right.  Cool.  Well, we appreciate it.  All right, guys.  Thanks, man.  All right.  Love you.  Bye.  And we'll replay that, and that's it for a while with the WWF. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah.  Right now.  That's it.  Okay, listen.  I don't know if you've seen the audio yet, but it's all over CNN.  Mike Tyson's over there.  Is he fighting again this weekend?  I've lost track of Tyson.  I guess he's in England fighting, trying to get his boxing career on track again.  And the people, just thrilled to have him.  Yeah.  They can't stand him.  They're outside his hotel, just protesting, saying that they should throw Mike Tyson out of England. 
[01:12:30]  Mostly the women's groups, Anthony.  The women hate him.  The women hate him over there.  They don't appreciate what he's done to women over here in our country, so they feel he doesn't belong in their country.  He was put in prison for rape, raping a woman.  And then there were allegations by his girlfriends and ex-wives about abuse, all kinds of stuff.  He should have to go back to prison for marrying the lady he's with now.  Oh, my God. 
[01:13:00]  Ooh.  Eee.  That's not funny.  What are you talking about?  So, on CNN, they got footage of Mike Tyson.  I guess the protesting has gotten so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police station,  because they're just protesting wherever he goes.  So he's out this window at the police station with a megaphone trying to talk to the lady protesters.  Well, that's what you want him to do.  Like, talk to the protesters. 
[01:13:30]  That won't piss them off any more than they already are, right?  Oh, I'm sure.  Hey, hey, you limey bitches.  Any of you limey bitches want to come in here and see who could take a punch like Robin Givens?  Come here, you bitches.  I'm going to kick your ass.  Come here.  I hope you're the first one.  Look at you, you toothless bitch.  Come here.  Should we shag? 
[01:14:00]  Thanks, Ray.  I had it all set up.  Rick, F me up.  Rick, get up.  Get away from me.  You make me sick.  I got everything already pushed.  Here, Rick.  Get out of my face.  I'll punch you.  Look, Rick.  Yeah.  Yeah, you scream like a bitch, Rick, don't you?  You scream like a limey bitch.  Come here, you pasty white English whore.  Why are they so angry at me?  Why are they angry? 
[01:14:30]  Because your queen is a twat.  Come here.  Oh, look, look.  This is the queen.  Come here, queen.  Oh, come on, body.  Oh, you can't even take a punch.  You're like sphinx.  You're like sphinx.  I came out of the corner and pounded at him.  Now I'm going to bend the queen over a chair and do her in the caboose.  Just like I did to that Miss USA or whatever the hell it was I banged. 
[01:15:00]  I went to prison for that.  I want a man in prison fizzing.  Why do I sound like the man dog?  I'm going to make you look like Lady Di after I'm done with you.  You're going to be bleeding.  You can rest assured.  Where's Prince Charles?  I'm going to bang you in your big ears.  Come here.  Okay, here's a fine lady.  Now, I want to talk sense to you. 
[01:15:30]  I have been rehabilitated.  I went to prison.  I'm just trying to get my fighting career back.  They don't look at me like that.  What would I do?  I don't even understand.  I'm like an animal.  He's like the Beatles over there.  They're chasing him around.  Yeah, but they want to kill me.  They don't want like a water grap or nothing.  They want to kill me.  Thank God they're all too much pussies to have guns over here. 
[01:16:00]  Even the police don't have them.  Look, here's one of them Bobbies.  That big stupid hat.  Look, I'm killing his ass.  I'm like King Kong.  I'm just running around.  Remember the King Kong movies?  It was in New York and they couldn't do nothing.  That's me in England.  Oh, come on.  The cops don't have guns so I could run rampant.  Come here, you bastard.  Look, I'm beating up the police.  Are they throwing soccer balls at you, Mike?  Yeah, soccer balls. 
[01:16:30]  That's all they got.  Look, I'm like a big guard booth in front of the palace and they got them guards with  the big fuzzy hats on.  Yeah.  You can't make them change the expression on their face.  Yeah.  Watch this.  See his expression now?  Now look at this.  Look, it's a bloody expression.  I made a change.  Now I'm going to take that furry hand and stick it in your keister.  And that's only to make room for my giant member. 
[01:17:00]  Look, it's Prince William.  Look at that fine young little man.  I'm going to be himself and abuse him.  I love England.  We're the Spice Girls.  I'm going to skewer them like a shish kebab.  I'll get all of them on there at once.  Come here, you whores.  Come here, you limey whores.  You all got bad teeth. 
[01:17:30]  Your teeth, they suck.  You got the scurvy.  I got a cure for that.  Yeah, that's the cure.  You look at it.  You look at it, bitch.  Go ahead.  Yeah, you ain't never seen on that one.  Where's Hugh Grant?  I'm going to do him too.  Come here, whores.  All English whores.  Lady Di was a whore slut, man. 
[01:18:00]  I'm just trying to be popular.  I'm like Mighty Joe Young.  Rump got ramping through the city.  Lady Di was a slut whore.  Going out with a towel head.  Making her country all pissed off at her.  Look at me just slacking down and stabbing you.  Shut up, bitch.  Am I making any headway on waiting over the people of England? 
[01:18:30]  Well, they're still a little pissed, Iron Mike.  Well, they're all stupid.  They got two TV stations that suck.  Yeah, look at my mighty mental, you bitch.  They only got two teeth in that whole head.  I went to that, I went to the London Zoo the other day. 
[01:19:00]  Uh-huh.  And they tried to stop me from leaving.  Yeah.  Something about her escapee.  Shut up.  Sarah Ferguson is a fat bitch.  I don't care if she's on that Weight Watchers or nothing.  I make her lose weight.  I go, come here.  Come here.  You know why you eat so much?  Because your mouth works.  Now it don't.  Now you lose some weight.  You fat bitch.  Look, your hair's red. 
[01:19:30]  Now so's your nose.  And now so's your hair.  Oh, look, here's the queen.  Come here, queen.  Right in the face.  You dried up slut.  You're making my Tyson laugh.  Try to stay in character. 
[01:20:00]  Man it up, but Rick screwed up my sound effect.  Now I'm going to go climb Big Ben and swat at aircraft.  T'was beauty killed the beast.  Hey, it's Fay Ray.  Take me back to Skull Island.  You nasty-ass English people. 
[01:20:30]  You've got the big, gappy old teeth.  I love the Irish Republican Army.  I'm learning how to make car bombs.  You people suck.  Am I winning them over?  Am I winning them over?  I don't think so, Iron Mike.  I appreciated what the Luftwaffe did.  They warped with their aircraft.  Back in World War II. 
[01:21:00]  Look at this.  I'm going to bite off Prince Charles' ears.  That's a hell of a meal.  He's got some big-ass ears.  He's an ugly mother...  Here you go.  I bet he's got a little acorn in his pants because his wife, the whorebag, Lady Di, was going out with a towel head.  People of England, your Lady Di was a whore. 
[01:21:30]  How am I doing?  You're not doing too loud there.  He had a muff like Don King's hair.  You're going to have a heart attack.  I'm getting more flack from you limeys, and Prince Charles is going to take it in the leather Cheerios.  Come here, Sarah Ferguson. 
[01:22:00]  I'm going to punch you in the rectum.  That's a low blow.  I'm going to punch you in the middle. 
[01:22:30]  I suck at the Falkland Islands.  A bunch of little Mexicans kick your ass.  James Bond's a pussy. 
[01:23:00]  I better get inside.  I'm just starting to throw stuff at Mike.  You guys sometimes, like, piss me off, okay?  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  Oh, my God. 
[01:23:30]  I can breathe again.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, man.  Actually, it's the Anthony show right now.  Nah, now come on.  That's all right.  I bow to you today, man.  I've been around you a long time, man.  I haven't laughed that hard in well over a year.  Oh, my God.  Mike, what's up?  Tom Brokendore just called, and that was the bit of the century, he said.  Of the century.  It was the bit of the aught, he said. 
[01:24:00]  That was unbelievable.  You guys got to play that again so I can tape that.  You know what?  No one else will play it before we get out of here again.  Really?  It's Friday.  You can just play it, like, again for the rest of the show.  You guys go home.  Yeah, we weren't even supposed to do new stuff today, but maybe we'll end the show with that today.  Hey, great job, guys.  That was great.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Have a good weekend.  You too.  I seem to like that.  Mike, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Yo, I think you guys got me sent to rehab.  What happened?  I was sitting there smoking my bong, listening to you guys, and when freaking Anthony starts 
[01:24:30]  talking about Prince Charles and his ears, I freaking started coughing, threw up all over  the place.  My mother walked in, I got my bong and my stash all over the place.  Freaking walking in, there's a heart attack on there.  The kids are walking around, dancing around, thinking Uncle Mike's a drug addict.  Jesus, guys, can you think, you know, play a little bit of something, a little famous  when I'm smoking?  Oh, man.  Oh, Jesus, you guys kill me.  All right, Mike.  All right, let me give a big F you out to him.  F the Rock.  All right, thank you, Mike.  All right, later.  Rick's getting that tape together. 
[01:25:00]  We're going to play that in a few minutes from yesterday, the very uncomfortable moment  when we had to tell the Rock you can't come on our show.  Yeah.  Debbie, what's up?  Yo, you guys are insane.  I don't, I have never laughed that hard.  That was not bit of the century.  That's bit of the millennium.  Look at that.  You've got to play that again.  Yeah, that was unbelievable.  Anthony, he bows to you.  I'll give you a Hummer, man.  Wow, look at that.  Incredible.  Hummers for bits.  Look at that, O.  Anyway, you guys are incredible. 
[01:25:30]  Please, please play that again.  All right.  Take care.  I was just happy you used one of my lines.  That was kind of nice.  Thanks, man.  Gee, thanks for making me feel special.  That was great.  Brian, what's up?  Oh, man, you guys are killing me.  You suck.  I was in a bank filling out a $5,000 money order, and I had headphones on.  I'm laughing hysterically.  They want to put me in a state asylum.  I totally threw up the money order, and the guy, so I said, you listen to this.  And he just started bawling, laughing. 
[01:26:00]  I got the whole bank laughing.  You guys suck.  We have a late entry in Bit of the Week.  Now we're going to have a problem between that and the CBS bit.  Thank you, Brian.  I appreciate it.  Mike, what's going on?  Iron Mike is going to kick your ass.  What are you, crazy man?  What's he going to do?  I don't know, man, but he's going to find out his little spies are everywhere.  All right, Mike.  Thanks, Mike.  Tom, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, Opie? 
[01:26:30]  All right.  Hey, Anthony, how's it going?  Hey.  All right, listen, that was hilarious, I got to say.  But, you know, about what you said about pizza starting in there, that was pretty bad, don't you think?  Well, she's a whore bag.  The chick was a slut.  Why do you think she was in the backseat of that car?  She would give him road head to her towel-headed boyfriend.  Oh, did he hang up? 
[01:27:00]  Oh, he didn't like my commentary?  I hung up on him.  I didn't want anyone wrecking our buzz today.  A lady die?  A lady die?  In the backseat, I heard that that towel-head boyfriend or her's member was in her hand, ripped right off.  Almost like getting a punch from Mike Tyson.  That's what she would look like after one of my blows.  That's right.  She's screaming from the grave, that dead bitch. 
[01:27:30]  I heard it was caught in her teeth.  Teeth.  How do you spell teeth?  Don't ask Mike Tyson how to spell.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  T-E-F-F.  T-E-A-F-F.  Toofs.  How do you spell teeth?  What do you got, Mike?  It's called to tell you guys how hilarious that bit was. 
[01:28:00]  Oh, cool.  I'm a first-time caller.  I've only been listening to you guys for a couple months now because I just moved to North Jersey.  I couldn't get you guys before.  Oh, thank you.  But you guys are absolutely hilarious.  Cool.  We appreciate it, Mike.  So, yeah, just keep it up, guys.  All right.  See you later.  Bye.  Bye.  Wow, all the calls.  That's all they want to talk about.  I know.  I thought we'd move on to something else.  But, Joe, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, fellas?  All right.  Hey, man.  I'm on my way down to South Jersey.  I almost crashed my car into a snowbank. 
[01:28:30]  All right.  Listen, I was practically crying.  I got people staring at me in other cars.  Hilarious.  Keep up the great work, man.  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  Take it easy.  You know, we're going to have to replay that before we leave for the weekend.  All right.  What we'll do is we'll replay it at the end of the show in case you missed it, okay?  Right when we leave.  Mike Tyson in England trying to win over the crowd from a...  Didn't sound so...  From a police station window.  It didn't sound like you were doing very well. 
[01:29:00]  All right, Anthony.  Rick has found the tape of The Rock from yesterday.  Cool.  We're going to take a very quick break.  Seriously, a very quick break.  Seriously, guys.  Seriously.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you.  You did an impression.  That sounded just like Carmen there.  Thank you.  Wow.  How many drinks do you have to do for that in the drinking game?  Thank you.  Don't ask me to do it again, for the love of God.  It has to be this Valium, man. 
[01:29:30]  He's still on it.  Everything's fine.  Now he's buying it on the corner.  No, no, no, no.  I buy a special kind of Valium.  You smoke it out of a glass pipe.  Someone called up Earl there and said,  did I hear Oak do an impression during the Star Jones thing?  I did a little quiz, too.  Jesus Christ.  Taking my gig over here, Oak.  If I keep it up, I can be like Gallagher, too.  I can tour the country as Anthony.  Almost like Anthony, but not quite like him.  Gallagher, too. 
[01:30:00]  So, smashing the watermelon for everyone.  All right.  Yeah, quick break, Ant.  Yeah.  Before that, an O&A favorite here.  And then as soon as we get back from commercials,  we're going to replay the rock from yesterday.  Cringe radio at its best.  Stay right where you are.  I can't even believe these morons.  He's a disgusting little man.  What a douchebag.  Trainwreck radio.  Get him going, bro.  This is sicker than faces of death.  It's the O&A show on 1027 WNEW on this lovely FU Friday. 
[01:30:30]  Hello.  Hi, Marion.  What's up?  How are you guys?  Good.  Hey.  First and foremost, I have to tell you,  you made this week a feeling like total crap.  It's so bearable.  I laughed. 
[01:31:00]  And today especially,  if I was sitting in my office,  as opposed to sitting in bed.  I know.  I know.  Oh, yeah.  What's listening?  I would have been handed a cake slip  for not being able to control my laughing.  Let's make you feel good tonight.  Okay, Marion.  Stop.  That's not nice.  I can't believe how crappy I feel.  Well, I'm a little clogged up.  Well, you're a snot factory.  Just a little.  And I've been like this this Monday night.  Oh, I hate that feeling. 
[01:31:30]  Isn't it the worst?  I hate it.  And you think, you know,  you go for the flu shot,  you think you're doing the right thing.  Oh, you got a flu shot?  I got a flu shot.  Yay me, right?  Yeah, you know,  I got to say,  I don't believe in flu shots.  Well, I'll never get another one.  I think anyone who gets a flu shot  and doesn't get the flu  wouldn't have gotten the flu anyway.  That's why they didn't get the flu.  Because I hear people,  oh, you got a flu shot.  Yeah, I don't know what happens.  Sometimes it doesn't take.  It's a placebo.  Well, let's not forget  the $100 in antibiotics  that do nothing but put you to sleep  and just put you out of your misery 
[01:32:00]  for an hour or two.  See, I don't mind that.  No, me neither.  Antibiotics don't help a flu.  Isn't it the greatest feeling, though,  when you get one nostril clear?  You're like, oh,  I can breathe.  Oh, damn, it's clogged up.  By the time you go to sleep,  no good.  Marion, you know what  clears your nose out, though?  What?  Sex.  It's true, though.  Right?  Got to get the juices flowing.  You have a stuffed nose,  it's scientifically proven.  Like, all of a sudden,  it just opens up  your airways and everything.  Have you just gotten 
[01:32:30]  over a cold, Anthony?  The second, no.  Marion, if you blow real hard,  what do you mean?  Her nose.  Oh, okay.  We'll clear up, man.  You guys...  Not everything we say  is in the gutter.  Listen, Ann,  I know what you're going through.  My cousin just went through,  but hang in there,  stay strong,  and just be careful  what you say,  because women are bitches.  Hey, Marion,  can I speak for Anthony  and probably other people  out there?  Okay.  And there are a lot  of people out there  that are very happy 
[01:33:00]  that they're getting divorced.  Oh, I know.  It's not like...  It's not always  a tragedy or...  It doesn't sound like  Anthony's holding  the razor against his wrist.  Believe me,  I understand.  No.  All I'm saying is that,  you know,  she can have like  ten people listening  just trying to get...  Okay, he said this.  You know what I mean?  Right.  People get so petty,  so that's all I'm saying.  And I believe you,  he sounds fine.  This is my job,  talking about my life.  All right.  There you go.  All right.  Well, you guys are great.  Have a great weekend.  Try to stay warm, then.  Oh, my God. 
[01:33:30]  What about that?  Is that the worst?  Sorry, excuse me.  I couldn't help myself.  What do you have,  a clogged nose?  What are you doing?  No, you could just...  You could like make...  See, you're not the only one  that could do impressions  on the show.  Oh, great.  It's not so good impressions.  Yeah, you're impersonating me,  great.  Dude, that is so frigging disgusting.  You guys are too bad.  All right, Marion.  Take care.  Have a good weekend.  Bye.  Bye.  There she goes, everyone, Marion. 
[01:34:00]  All right.  Rick queued up The Rock  from yesterday.  The Croc.  This is definitely  worth replaying today.  Definitely,  considering it's  the talk of the internet.  Every wrestling site  is talking about  The Rock's appearance  on our show yesterday.  Should we quickly do...  Just quickly do the history,  the quick rundown  of our relationship  with The Rock  and the WWF.  Well, for a long time,  we've...  We don't have to be  as harsh today  because we said 
[01:34:30]  what we had to say yesterday,  but pretty much  just lay the facts out  really fast  before we get into this.  For quite a while,  we would talk about  the WWF  and their events.  We would watch them  on TV,  get their pay-per-views,  promote them,  and they wouldn't  pay money  to be on this station.  We did it  because we enjoyed it.  And we'd have  wrestlers on here.  Some of them  did good interviews.  Some of them  did bad interviews.  But we rolled with it,  had a good time with them.  Had a great...  Had a good relationship  with the WWF.  They definitely  added to our radio show 
[01:35:00]  without a doubt.  We share similar audiences,  I think,  portions of our audience.  And then they say,  we have The Rock for you.  Rock is like the top guy  in WWF right now.  So they send The Rock up  and we figured  we'd have this guy,  Sick Boy,  on our show  who runs a wrestling website  and very informed  on wrestling.  Could add another dimension  to the whole thing.  So he's in here.  What we didn't know  was Rock was informed  that on Sick Boy's website  were some  could-be-called  racist comments,  I guess. 
[01:35:30]  I think it was more satire.  And The Rock was very upset  that Sick Boy  was even here in the studio.  Asked us if we knew  anything about this  Sick Boy's website  and the racism  that's on it.  We kind of said no,  but we know about his website.  It's satire,  blah, blah, blah.  Rock,  pissed off,  gets up  and storms off the show.  After we told him  we had no idea  about what he was talking about,  which we didn't.  Had no clue.  We were blindsided.  Yeah.  And then we were upset  because he wouldn't discuss it  after we went off the air.  He just kind of left. 
[01:36:00]  Yeah.  And it was just like,  whoa,  what did we do wrong,  you know?  So we finally,  we never,  well,  then a week goes by  we really never got  an explanation  from the WWF  about what happened.  We felt like  someone,  you know,  should have gave us  an explanation.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden  out of nowhere  they say,  well,  you know,  we want to rebook  the rock on your show.  And he'll explain himself  and you guys can say  and do whatever you want.  We're like,  fine.  I guess that's fair.  Fair enough.  We're a little upset about it.  And then we were invited  to the grand opening 
[01:36:30]  of the WWF restaurant  the other night.  We didn't want to go  because we felt  a little weird  about everything.  But we were convinced  that it would be  a great time.  They wanted us there.  It would be great.  Please come down.  Please.  We'd love to see you.  Yeah.  Pick up the story there.  So we go down there  with our invitations.  We're on the list.  We're going to get in.  What the hell?  Have a little fun  with one of these  grand opening things.  We stand in line  for an hour  in the freezing cold.  Chicks with us.  And they're very disappointed 
[01:37:00]  they don't get in.  Chicks in hot skirts.  I don't understand  why you ladies do that.  But it's like...  Because it's like  two degrees out.  Yeah.  It's single digits.  And Sandy has like  a hot skirt on.  Yeah.  You know,  most of her leg is showing.  Rick's wife's  same hot skirt type of thing.  I'm like,  you guys are nuts.  Yeah, it was a little cold  for a skirt.  Yeah.  Although Rick was wearing one too.  Kind of weird,  but I guess he could tell you.  Well, he came right from the show.  So he still had the skirt on  from our radio show.  The skirt on. 
[01:37:30]  Right.  Anyway,  we stand in line  for an hour.  Rick goes and tries  to look for somebody  that we have  a relationship with.  And no one wants  to hear it.  No one knows anything.  Long story short,  we don't get in.  Don't get in.  Us and close  to a thousand people.  I thought it was more  like five or six hundred,  but a bunch of people  said it had to be  close to a thousand.  The place was filled  to capacity.  Please go home.  Right.  No one else is getting  in this evening.  Thank you.  Clear the streets.  And Rick did talk  to a couple guys  from WWF.  They could care less.  Yeah.  After we were 
[01:38:00]  personally invited  by some big honchos  from the WWF.  Yeah.  So we were definitely  hurt.  Let's not, you know,  pussyfoot around this.  And we practically  were banging on  the window of the place  trying to get  someone's attention  going, hey,  we're here.  We want to come in.  Something.  Yeah.  Well, you know,  next, so we're pissed.  Next day, which is  yesterday, we're  scheduled still to have  The Rock come in.  We have no intention  of letting him on the  show.  And we said such.  We said, yeah, we were  just, we were filled to  capacity here in the 
[01:38:30]  studio.  Right.  Can't let anyone else  in.  Right.  After you.  We had a big wait  from the WWF on and we  even said, look, don't  even bother bringing him  by.  Yeah.  They thought it was  cute to bring him on  by.  So we just had him on  the phone in the lobby  of this building, which  is a floor up.  Yeah.  And two locked doors  away.  We're not going to lie.  We were pussies.  Yeah.  The studio was locked.  We had two huge cops.  Actually, interestingly  though, The Rock brought a  huge guy with him as  well.  Really?  Huge security guy that  meant business as well.  So I think on their side, 
[01:39:00]  they weren't sure how  everything was going to be  be down here as well.  Yeah.  All right.  So we send the Puerto  Rican to do our battle  for us.  Rick, once again.  Rick goes upstairs.  We go, Rick, you have  to be there to give the  phone to Rock.  Okay?  Mm-hmm.  And I guess that's where  we're going to pick up  the tape.  Rick upstairs with The  Rock.  Mm-hmm.  With The Rock having no  idea what is about to  happen.  Yeah.  And then stay tuned  because I think Jay Moore  pops on at the end of  this whole bit. 
[01:39:30]  So here it is.  Check it out from  yesterday.  Hey, Rick.  Yo.  What's going on,  buddy?  Not much, dude.  I'm upstairs with, uh,  The Notorious Rock.  All right.  And, uh, he's now  outside talking to his  peeps, so to speak.  Okay.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  So I think, uh, I think  they're going to pull him  out of here, believe it  or not.  They're not going to put  him on the phone?  I don't know.  We'll see.  All right.  Here he comes.  Okay.  All right, cool.  Here he comes.  Here we go.  I don't care what?  Uh, okay.  Hello. 
[01:40:00]  Hey, Dwayne.  What's this?  It's O.P. and Anthony,  Dwayne.  How are you?  Boys, how y'all doing?  Pretty good.  Very good.  What's going on?  Not much.  What's going on with you?  Not too much at all.  Whoever sang that last  song was pretty damn good.  That's a good one, right?  I say it's entertaining.  It's entertaining.  Oh, that's good.  Yeah.  Well, we were looking  forward to seeing you  last night at the big party.  Yeah, I heard about that.  I just got buzzed about that. 
[01:40:30]  The best I could do  is apologize.  I can't ask Jim Byrne  didn't do what he needed to do.  No, we just spit out.  Hey, you know what?  Legitimately, y'all should  be pissed off about that.  I absolutely agree.  You know, he did tell me  you guys were coming down.  I'd look forward to seeing y'all.  Uh-huh.  But I apologize about that.  Really?  This is a little awkward,  isn't it?  Yeah.  Yeah, we had a little issue 
[01:41:00]  from the last time.  Well, you know...  We didn't really deal with.  Here's the thing.  You're absolutely right.  We didn't do that.  You know, now that I'm here,  I appreciate y'all letting me on.  The thing about that was,  as far as we're being  in the same room,  you know, I was buzzed  about that guy's sick boy.  He came in.  I certainly just couldn't  be in the same room  with an ass like that.  And I didn't...  And if y'all took it personal,  it certainly didn't mean  to be taken that way.  I just had to get  the hell out of the room.  And that's the way it was. 
[01:41:30]  And so, you know,  the way I left  wasn't the most professional way.  And I shouldn't have  left like that.  But at the same time,  again, man,  I just couldn't be  in the same room  with that asshole.  And excuse the language.  And I did let a lot  of listeners down  and realize that.  But you took it personal.  We took it very personal  because I told you flat out  and I had no idea  what you were talking about  and you didn't believe us.  No, no, no.  That really wasn't the case.  It wasn't the case  that I didn't believe you guys.  It was just the case  I had this guy  sitting right here beside me.  If not,  I wanted to bash his brains in. 
[01:42:00]  And, you know,  that's something  I take very personally  in terms of, you know,  racial discrimination.  And, you know,  doing that,  I didn't want you guys  to take it personal.  And I'm not saying  I didn't believe you guys  when you guys flat out  looked me in the eye  and said,  we have no idea  what you're talking about.  We have no clue  about this guy's website.  Well, that was the truth.  And then I...  You know,  and it's just like  I told Jim Byrne earlier.  You know,  I even talked with Vince.  I said, you know,  whether or not those guys knew  really wasn't the case. 
[01:42:30]  And I pretty much believed him  that they didn't know.  They just had a guest on  who had this, you know,  a real crappy website  posting, you know,  racist comments.  The point was  I just couldn't be  in the same room  with that guy.  I got up,  I left,  I took it personal  in terms of him  being there with me.  Again,  one of the most professional  thing to do  just to get up  and walk off the,  walk off your guys' show  that way.  I know you guys  are big supporters.  WWF were.  Were of The Rock.  I knew that too.  Read the article.  Saw one of you 
[01:43:00]  was chewing on The Rock's head.  But, you know,  again,  it was never made  to be taken personal  towards y'all too.  I just was pissed  that you left without  even like when we  were off the air.  I just wish you would  like drag us out  in the hall  and explain yourself.  Well,  I certainly could have  done that.  But the thing about that  was I just wanted  to get the hell  out of there.  That was the thing.  We were in shock.  We're like,  where the hell  did this come from?  At least explain yourself.  And then the WWF  doesn't even,  you know,  have the courtesy  to like calls  the next day  to explain  what the hell  was going on.  Oh, see,  I thought they did.  No. 
[01:43:30]  No.  No one has ever  given us an explanation  until right now.  They were pissed at us.  Oh, is that right?  It's kind of weird.  Yeah,  because then,  I won't say who called us,  but one of your people  called and said  that you guys  were listening  after you left  and you're not  and they weren't happy  about what was going on.  Well, who called?  You might as well  say who the candy ass was.  Susan Warner.  Okay.  The one that's probably  right next to you right now.  Okay.  Yes.  So she gave me  her cell phone number.  I called her back  and she, 
[01:44:00]  I guess you were busy  at the book signings.  I was.  I did have a book signing.  And she said,  well, I can't discuss it now  and that was the last we heard.  And then on top of that,  you know,  we were like shut out  of the cute little party  last night.  So we're really pissed off.  No, no.  Don't blame you  about the party.  I don't blame you  one bit about the party  and had I known  y'all were standing out there.  Again,  Jim Byrne buzzed me  last night  because I hadn't talked  to Jim.  I said,  listen,  Jim,  I called him yesterday  and we finally talked  last night  at the WWF New York.  I said,  you know,  where are those guys at? 
[01:44:30]  I want to know  where we're at  in terms of this.  I need to talk  to them beforehand  to let myself  explain what happened.  So anyway,  he told me  that you guys  were supposed to be there  and I know you guys  are putting your asses  off out there.  I would have  had Jim or somebody,  Jim Dotson or somebody  just come up  and get you guys.  Yeah,  we had like girls  with us.  We looked like ass wipes,  man.  It's like all of a sudden  the cops are chasing us away.  Our chicks are looking at us  like a couple of losers.  Man,  it was so effing  embarrassing,  man.  And Rick,  Rick is up there  with you.  He's pounding 
[01:45:00]  on the window  of the place  and everyone's  ignoring us.  He went up  to a couple  of WWF people  and they didn't  know who we were.  We weren't on any list.  It was just bad.  We had our stupid  little invitations  like everybody else  that got chased away.  It was just so  freaking embarrassing.  And you had  skirt with you  to boot.  Yeah,  you know how bad  that looks.  Doesn't look good,  especially coming off  the heels of  Roger there.  Yeah,  of course.  You know,  I wanted to see you guys  last night  as I wanted to see you guys  today.  I wanted to come back  on the show 
[01:45:30]  as you guys know that.  I sat with Vince  and I said,  you know,  there's got to be a way  to reconcile this.  I know these guys  are big fans  or we're big fans  for that matter  of the product  as well as the WWF  as well as The Rock  and I said,  you know,  I really need to  reconcile this.  I didn't want them  to take me leaving  off their show  personally.  It wasn't like that.  You guys were kind enough  to let The Rock on  and I appreciate that.  But, you know,  again,  the reasoning was  that I just couldn't  be in the same room 
[01:46:00]  with that guy  and that was it.  You know,  him being there beside me,  I took it personal.  Again,  you know,  I wanted to stick my foot  so far up,  bury it deep  into his ass.  But, yeah,  just, again,  I just couldn't be there  and walking off  your guy's show  wasn't the best thing  to do.  But, you know,  at the time,  I thought it was  the right thing to do  and I didn't mean  for you all  to take it personally.  And, again, too,  you know,  what made it even worse  was, you know,  I had a lot of rock fans  listening that day  and, you know,  for the most part,  they kind of took  it personal too. 
[01:46:30]  Yeah.  Which certainly  wasn't the case.  You know,  I never ever meant  it to be that way.  I just wanted to let  them know too as well  that it wasn't personal  against the fans.  It wasn't personal  Anthony or your show  for that matter.  I just couldn't be  in the same room  with that guy  that was in.  And as far as  for the party,  I've done that,  but there's a way  to make it up.  If at all,  if you guys are  interested in doing that,  you just go on  and let me know.  Well, we're like hurt, man.  Yeah, we feel like 
[01:47:00]  losers and everything.  And we don't really feel  like being in the same room  with you all.  No, we can't.  We can't.  We can't in good conscience.  You know,  have you come down  in here when we  couldn't get into  your establishment  or, you know,  your company's establishment.  Right.  You know what I mean?  So it's like, yeah.  I know what you mean.  No explanation needed.  I understand.  I know that.  No doubt.  We also have,  we also have our fans  that, you know, 
[01:47:30]  look to us  to do certain things  and stand up  for what we believe in.  What's wrong is wrong.  What happened last night  was wrong.  I don't blame you guys  one bit for standing up.  No problem.  All right.  We're filled to capacity  in here today.  We're filled to capacity.  Please disperse.  There's just no cops  up here, dude.  Yeah, we could send a couple.  We got a couple down here.  I'm sure you'd give them  a pretty good fight.  Can we?  All right, Rock.  We're going to have  to airstrike you.  Hey, no sweat. 
[01:48:00]  Appreciate it.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  There he goes.  Hey, Jay.  You guys are brutal.  You guys have more balls  than the NBA.  Dude, we made him call  from our lobby.  He wasn't doing nothing  on that show.  The whole time I'm listening,  I thought you guys were going to go,  well, let's see what Jay thinks. 
[01:48:30]  And I wrote, like,  all these notes down there.  Oh, yeah.  That's all we need.  The guy said he was sorry twice.  He opened the conversation  with an apology.  Yeah.  Called his own boss  a candy ass.  Right.  We know The Rock  has issues of rage.  And he seemed like a guy  that's been to some  anger management  therapy sessions.  Came to terms  with what he did wrong.  I don't know what it's like  to be an African American,  nor do I pretend to be,  but I can imagine  if a guy was sitting  next to me 
[01:49:00]  that made jokes  about me being  a half-breed  on a website,  it might,  and if I was The Rock  and had issues of rage  and I was sitting  next to that person  and his name,  you know,  Sick Boy.  Sick Boy's new name,  by the way,  is Rocker.  And John.  There you go.  I was like,  yeah,  we'll let the guy in.  I was like,  as far as,  you know,  you guys waiting out  in the cold,  Anthony's,  I mean,  Opie,  I feel for,  but,  you know,  Opie,  I don't feel that bad for  because he had coats and stuff.  Anthony,  we know,  he was cold-blooded.  He all could have died. 
[01:49:30]  Anthony could have died out there.  You know,  Opie can put on,  like,  letters and stuff,  but what can Anthony do?  Wait for the sun  to come out  and sit on a rock.  I think you're missing  the big point here,  though.  We just made a guy  drive all the way  to the station  to sit in our lobby  so we could tell him  he can't be on our show.  And that's why  you guys are the best.  Some of the instant feedback.  You guys are brutal.  That was unbelievable.  I was getting uncomfortable.  I was like,  oh,  this is nice.  This guy's pulling his act together.  He was like,  real sorry about it.  I'm like,  okay,  this is good. 
[01:50:00]  This is nice.  Now we're all going to make friends.  And you guys go,  can't watch it,  big,  can't watch it,  the rock.  The rock.  Some people actually liking  the rock out of this one  saying he came off good.  I got to say,  he did come off  sounding like a gentleman.  At least we got...  Just right now?  At least we got an explanation.  But we...  He came off...  We do...  I'm in L.A.  I'm 3,000 miles away.  Yeah.  And I want to hug him.  He did come off  sounding like a gentleman.  We do have footage of him, 
[01:50:30]  you know,  in our lobby  behind glass  trying to get into...  Yeah.  What?  Did he...  You know what's funny?  Did Steve take that?  Yeah, we got to take.  He ran into the glass  not knowing he was there.  Oh, my God.  Oh, come on.  He knocked off the glass.  Jay Moore,  you're never going to get work  if you keep talking like that.  I just don't...  No, I'm fine  as long as I don't go on Nightline.  Dude, we have two  of the hugest cops, too,  as backup today,  just in case.  Yeah, I heard my boys  call you.  I heard my local boys  call you,  Billy Mack and Fat Phil.  I got a message  from Fat Phil, 
[01:51:00]  the cop, going,  thanks for calling me Fat Phil.  Now everyone's calling me that.  Can't you change it  on the radio?  Okay, I'm changing it.  It's Fat or Phil.  All right, Rick's coming in.  We'll get the real story now.  That was amazing.  You guys have bigger balls  than me.  You absolutely  have bigger balls than me.  Although,  it's easy to say  all that stuff  when you're upstairs  behind a locked glass door.  All right, hold on.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Hold on.  Oh, Jay.  How about a massage?  All right, hold on.  We got Rick back  into the studio  who was at ground zero. 
[01:51:30]  Jay, I wasn't behind  any glass.  You were right next to him, right?  I was about two feet  away from him.  Yeah.  And, oh,  I think I'm dressed.  Are you sweating?  I'm sweating my ass off.  Rick's playing  like Michael Jackson  in a Toys R Us.  I can see him like,  what,  they want to do this  on the phone?  I'm just like,  uh, yeah.  Yeah, the rock.  Yeah, the rock.  Rick's sweating  like Mark Furman  at the Million Man March.  Oh, my God.  I'm sweating  like a freaking  altar boy  at a priest convention  right now.  Rick's sweating  like Mike Tyson 
[01:52:00]  at a spelling bee.  Oh, my goodness.  So how did they take it?  Um, I guess they  took it okay.  Look at his voice.  He is.  Rick is a wreck.  It's time to take it.  You've got to see Rick.  I've never seen him  so freaked out right now.  Oh, man.  Look at the size  of these cops.  Jesus Christ.  When me and Rick  almost threw down,  I would rather take a picture  of you with your pants  down right now.  Yeah, but when that happened,  when Rick and I  almost threw down,  he had like this weird  glimmer in his eye 
[01:52:30]  like, yeah,  like he could taste blood.  So this guy,  the rock,  must be unbelievable.  Yeah, I was going  to taste my own.  So what did they say  to you after they hung up?  Well, I tried  to play stupid.  I was like,  so what did the guys say?  You know,  like shivering and stuff.  And I'm like,  that was going to be it.  I'm like,  oh, they didn't invite  you downstairs?  Oh, my God.  And he's like,  no, that's it.  Like Emo Phillips  on Def Comedy Jam.  And you should have seen  the guy he brought with him. 
[01:53:00]  Oh, this guy was built  like a brick s-house.  Really?  Oh.  Everyone's coming  to the studio.  Psycho Mark?  He grabbed the video camera  from me,  and he's like,  let me take a picture of you.  I'm like,  okay,  only if I can get  a people's elbow.  Really?  Oh, the rock  might hurt you with that.  He keeps talking to himself  in the background.  A lot of people think  we should have let him in,  but no, I'm sorry.  No, he...  I thought that you  should have let him in,  but when you made your stand,  you opened up 
[01:53:30]  an entire new room  of respect  that I didn't know  I had for you.  You know,  if we would have been able  to get into their little event  last night,  things would have been different,  but he represents  the organization  that we were a little  unhappy with today,  so we had to do  the same thing  to The Rock,  not let him in.  You guys have balls of steel  when you're two stories  beneath the earth.  Exactly.  Exactly.  And poor Rick  up on the front line.  Yeah, we're not stupid. 
[01:54:00]  Come on, Jay.  You know us.  You know,  but like you said,  we made a stand  earlier in the show  and we had a key to it  no matter what.  Exactly.  That's why you're  the best show.  The Rock came across  very well.  He explained himself.  I appreciate all that.  Thank you.  but it wasn't good enough  to get him in here.  We're really hurt  from yesterday.  You want me to make  a prediction?  Yeah.  You know we're all  afraid of The Rock?  Yeah.  I have a friend  that's in WWF school  right now.  He's from New Zealand.  He's a Maori Indian.  It's not,  we call them Indians,  but they're Maori warriors. 
[01:54:30]  His name is Gingy.  I predict  that he will kick  The Rock's ass.  Gingy will kick  The Rock's ass.  We'll look forward to that.  I like that.  I like that dance.  I like that dance.  He's 6'6", 320.  Not enough to fat on him.  All right.  He is.  Wow.  He's going to kick  The Rock's ass.  We'll have a guy,  we will actually have,  speaking of we again,  we,  Opie and Anthony  and friends,  will have  a man  that is bigger  than The Rock 
[01:55:00]  that we will feel  safe standing next to  saying,  well,  up yours,  Rock.  All right, Jay.  We're going to let you go  because we're sweating.  All right.  You guys are so funny.  Call Priceline.  Get Shatner's  two-paying towel.  I love you guys.  Stay in touch.  All right, Jay.  Thank you.  Thank you.  There he goes.  The talent of Jay Moore.  Keep the cop in the studio.  You've got to introduce  the two huge cops  that helped us out today.  Oh, my God.  This is the Opie and Anthony  security task force 
[01:55:30]  that I brought in today.  Holy mother of pearl.  This is Mark and Tom.  That was a mind-forge.  I would never want  to mess with you guys, man.  You want to do  that handcuff thing now?  No.  No.  See how long it takes  for these guys to come to you?  That's okay.  That would have to be  like a record.  Like, it would just be like,  boom, click, done.  Well, thank you guys.  We appreciate it.  Yeah, absolutely.  I'm coming up here.  Big fans of the show?  Hopefully.  Cool.  Say hi to the guys for us,  all right?  All right, we're going to  take a break.  We're going to take a break 
[01:56:00]  and let's hear it for Rick  for being brave enough  to be on the front lines.  I just hope Steve has on video  or Mark has on video  the things he made  when I said,  no, you've got to do this  from the phone.  Yeah.  Because all of a sudden  he did the neck thing  and he kind of looked around.  Oh, no.  The neck thing.  I was just like,  oh, here it comes.  You never want the neck thing.  The instant feedback  coming alive.  People not believing  we actually received 
[01:56:30]  the people's apology.  Well, you know,  I appreciate that  from him and stuff.  Yeah.  Because we really were hurt.  But we're still pissed off  at the WWF.  Yeah.  But you've got to say,  you know,  the guy came across  as a gentleman  and he explained himself  very well, I think.  And that's that.  And we had to stand  our ground today.  We told the WWF earlier  that we would not  let him in today.  And we had to stick to that.  It would still take  a miracle and an act of God  to get us back  on board that ship.  But, you know,  I think he came across 
[01:57:00]  as a gentleman.  All right, man.  Let's take a break.  We'll be back.  Opie and Anthony.  There's no level 2-0  that you guys want to take to.  Oh, please stop.  7-W-N-E-W.  Hey, Anthony,  Fidelity Diamond.  Ah, the engagement ring  specialist.  Valentine's Day.  Coming up,  a lot of people  are going to pop the question.  Get married.  Are you doing that  this Valentine's Day, Opie?  Um, no.  Yeah, I guess not.  But there are some people 
[01:57:30]  that are ready  to make the plunge  into holy matrimony.  And, uh,  boy, you want to get  a good ring, don't you?  You want to know  that you're getting  a quality diamond.  Yeah.  And most of us  aren't experts  in the subject.  You know, Ant,  payback is a bitch.  Yeah.  Everything you said  about the birth  of my sister's daughter  earlier in the show,  and now I get  to sit here  and watch you  do a live read  for engagement rings.  This is great.  What do you think? 
[01:58:00]  Just because, uh,  my, uh,  my marriage  may have hit  the rocks, Opie?  Hit the rocks?  And, uh,  and, uh,  hit the mighty iceberg?  Your marriage  received more damage  than the Titanic,  I think.  Yeah, all of its  watertight compartments  are flooded.  There's not enough  lifeboats.  More damage  than enough  lifeboats.  All right, so,  uh, but, but what,  what am I going to be  all bitter on life  itself and people  that are in love  and ready to get  married, Opie? 
[01:58:30]  I say no.  Very good.  I say, I say no.  I say you go to  Fidelity Diamond,  the engagement ring  specialists.  They educate you  on, uh,  buying a diamond.  Most people don't  know what the hell  to do when they  buy a diamond.  These people,  you make an  appointment with them,  you go in,  they teach you  about, uh,  cut, clarity,  carrot, the whole  thing.  Teach you what a  good diamond is.  You pick out  your diamond loose  and, uh,  you pick out  your setting  and you know  what you're getting.  Simple as this,  you're not going  to get ripped off, 
[01:59:00]  okay?  Right.  And now,  through the end  of Valentine's  Day,  buy your diamond  engagement ring  at Fidelity Diamond  and get a platinum  engagement ring  setting for free.  That's a $500 value  at Fidelity Diamond,  the engagement ring  specialist.  Give them a call,  201-261-6555.  That's 201-261-6555  for Fidelity Diamond,  the engagement ring  specialist.  1027-WNEW,  it's the Opie and  Anthony show.  It's FU Friday.  Hey, man. 
[01:59:30]  Had a lot of fun  on the radio this week.  Yeah.  You are listening to  the award-winning  Opie and Anthony show.  Yeah, we actually won  the, uh,  the Air Award  for an afternoon  drive radio.  How about that,  Opie?  Where is our  little statuette?  Uh, we put it  on the porn shelf  in our office.  Is it like a bookend  on our porn collection?  It's probably, uh,  placed on the  porn shelf, Anthony.  Very, very proud  of that.  Yep.  Wonderful.  We should, uh, 
[02:00:00]  I don't know.  Should we keep it?  Yeah.  Yeah?  It's an honor.  We're not gonna lie.  It's cool.  It's an honor.  It's cool just  because I know  how everyone else  feels about us  winning that thing.  Yeah.  That's the best  part about it  is that everybody  else in the industry  hates the fact  that we won it.  Right.  There's even stuff  on, you know,  uh, message boards  and websites and stuff.  Uh, who do you think  should have won  the Air Award  for afternoon drive radio? 
[02:00:30]  Like, they don't  want to accept  that we won,  so make up  somebody else that won.  It's like,  gee, thanks, guys.  We appreciate it.  We don't care.  Uh, still on the way  bit of the week?  Yes.  I'm telling you  right now, Ant.  Yeah.  Bit of the week,  I mean, there was  a landslide vote  for the CBS bit  that was written  up in the paper  this week.  Yeah.  But, uh,  Mike Tyson bit  from earlier today  coming, coming on  strong in the stretch.  So, please, uh,  send in your  bit of the week, uh,  suggestions, okay? 
[02:01:00]  Sure thing.  Fax line 212-957-9639.  All right, Anthony?  Making a very late  comeback.  Anthony, did you read  about Celine Dion  in the paper today?  Uh, yeah.  Everyone, everyone  waiting for our  comments on Celine Dion.  It's being reported  in the papers today  that, uh,  she is pregnant  with twins, Anthony.  Woo!  Now, one paper's  saying that, uh,  she's pregnant with twins.  The other's saying  it's, uh, it's false.  It's not true.  I would like to think  that, uh, it is true 
[02:01:30]  and that Celine Dion  is pregnant with twins, Ant.  With twins.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  What, they freeze  her husband's sperm  or something?  Did you see that?  He has cancer,  so they, uh,  froze his sperm  and she was impregnated  with her husband's,  uh, frozen sperm.  Yeah.  I guess because, uh,  what kind of cancer  does he have  that he can't, uh,  just give her  the high, hard one  and do it that way?  Well, they, they wanted,  uh, you know,  make sure they were  going to have kids.  Right, with no good. 
[02:02:00]  Well, that's something.  That is how  my sperm live on.  I am pregnant.  Finally.  We have been trying  for so long  to get pregnant.  And finally,  my husband's sperm  slammed into my egg.  Much like the mighty  Titanic  slammed that iceberg.  Splitting it open  and fertilizing an egg  to make another  Celine, hopefully.  Hopefully, my legacy  will live on  as will my camel toll. 
[02:02:30]  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  Whoa!  It is such a happy moment  for my 58-year-old husband,  Rene.  When he found out  I was pregnant  with twins.  You know,  twin hippos  could fit side by side  in my camel toll.  But these are just  twin babies.  All of the sperm  that was swimming around 
[02:03:00]  in the icy waters  of my uterus.  Do you know  most of them die?  Yeah.  Most of the sperm  never make it.  Correct.  They die there  in the icy waters  of my uterus.  But two,  two sperms  lived on,  swam,  swimming,  using all of their might  to find the egg.  The egg to cling to.  These sperms  are the ones  that fertilized  the eggs.  While the others died,  these sperms  were true 
[02:03:30]  survivors.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Do you know  my twin children  can grow to adulthood  and still fit  out of my camel toll?  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  That huge crevasse  between my legs.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  You should sing.  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha! 
[02:04:00]  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Do you know  the reason  it had to be  artificial insemination?  I know.  Why?  They say  because Rene  has cancer  and they froze  his sperm  and put it in.  But the truth  of the matter  is he could  not even feel  the sides  of my mighty  camel toll.  Ha ha ha ha!  I am so huge.  Ha ha ha ha!  He kind of slammed  it against the side  a couple of times  but it did not work.  Ha ha ha ha!  Now this frozen sperm...  So they made a sperm popsicle. 
[02:04:30]  Ha ha ha ha!  Now this frozen sperm,  was it as blue as, uh...  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha ha ha!  Yes.  As blue as, uh,  DiCaprio  at the end of Titanic?  Yes.  Ha ha ha ha ha!  That's what they  looked like,  this sperm frozen.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  Like Leo  at the end of Titanic.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!  My sperm  will go on.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha Michaellere!  Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
[02:05:00]  Go watch a clapboard with dum 비 ib�ario!  Cool!  It was like having an ice pop in there!  pop in there. The frozen sperm of my husband, Rene. But I can have twins now. And I will  dress them in little jump suits to show off their tiny little camel toes. Just like mommy.  My camel toe will live on. My camel toe will go on. 
[02:05:30]  Alright, it's a happy day for Celine and Rene. Yes. Congratulations, Celine. Please. Pregnant  with twins. Boy, that's got to be something for the OBGYN checking her out. Alright, Celine,  hop up on the table. Alrighty, why don't we take a look over. Oh my. Look at the size 
[02:06:00]  of that. Let's just, oh, hello. Echo. Celine, wow, you've got a lot of room in here. Yeah,  let me, you know, I don't even need instruments. I'm just going to crawl right in and take a  look around firsthand. We don't need a sonogram or anything. Wow, here, deep inside Celine's  room. Look at the size of this place. Is anyone in here? In here, in here, in here. 
[02:06:30]  Monocchio! Monocchio!  Brr, it's freezing in here. It's like a Venus fly snatch. I've got to watch out. Scoop me  right up. Just, uh, where the hell's the light switch in here? It's pitch black. Oh my god. 
[02:07:00]  Woo! Yeah, damn. What's that? Trout?  Just going to climb way up here. Yeah, I could open up a water park in here. People could just  slide right back out. Wherever you are. I'm playing the snatch flute. Wow. Oh my god. What is that? Oh my god. It's a T-Rex. 
[02:07:30]  What the hell's that doing in here?  I just walked over here. Oh my god. This is disgusting.  Who the hell's that sitting there?  Buddy, that's it. What are you doing in Celine's womb? 
[02:08:00]  Oh my god, look. It's that little Kipner boy from Jaws.  It wasn't a shark after all.  We were swimming. We got sucked up by Celine's huge cage.  There's another walk over here.  Can we see your stuff?  Oh, Fee! Hey, how you doing?  All right, we're just going to go for a little hat smear here. It might feel a little fresher.  There we go. 
[02:08:30]  I got enough of that.  Wherever you are, I believe.  All right, I got to get out of here.  Oh my god, look at this.  This place is huge.  Oh my god, what's that? It's coming right for us. 
[02:09:00]  Don't even know what it was.  Better safe than sorry.  Oh, very good.  You got to do a little bit.  I see a light.  What the hell is this?  Oh my god, it's a tractor-trailer in Celine's womb.  Oh, there it is. 
[02:09:30]  There's a little baby.  Look at the camel talk.  Can you walk out of her womb and step out of her pants, please?  I'm going to get out of here.  All right, Joe's coming out for the exit here.  I'll stop right around the corner.  Oh, there's no way to do this.  Come on, sir.  Hey, what's coming after now? 
[02:10:00]  Is that an Apache attack helicopter?  All right, well, there you have it.  Celine having the twins.  Congratulations.  On CBS.  Congratulations to Celine and her husband there.  Maybe that's where the CBS FM broadcast from, Celine's womb.  Opie and Anthony Afternoon. 
[02:10:30]  Mason and Kalinske Mornings.  The Radio Chick Middays.  On 1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hey, man.  For the Zephy Friday, in the studio, Jeff Norris.  Hey, Jeff, want to say hi real fast?  Oh, geez.  How we doing here?  Hi.  It's Archie, everyone.  Archie hasn't been on the show in a while.  Well, it's been quite a while there.  I'm divorcing Edith. 
[02:11:00]  You're divorcing Edith.  Very similar there to what my good colleague, dear Anthony, is doing.  Oh, yeah?  Oh, absolutely.  And when I'm done, I hope she looks like Cole Brown had a paper cut.  Oh, my goodness.  I'm absolutely serious.  I don't want to mention any names, Melissa, but I won't anyway.  What's the matter there?  Having a rough time there?  Rougher than rough.  Rough ain't the word, dear.  All right.  You want to stick around for a little while, Arch?  We'll be here.  Okay.  We'll be here.  We're going to play a couple tunes, take a musical break here.  It is Friday. 
[02:11:30]  People like to rock a little bit with the show.  Sure.  And you only have a few minutes before we tally the votes, Anthony, for Bit of the Week.  Yeah.  It's pretty much between two bits at this point.  CBS, FM, Bit.  Yep.  And, wow, right under the wire today, the Mike Tyson from England seems to have struck a nerve.  I don't think the Mike Tyson bit's going to make it.  We'll see.  Oh, okay.  We're going to close the voting in about eight minutes, so get your vote in, 212-757-1027,  or you can fax it in at 212-957-9639. 
[02:12:00]  We'll be back in two songs right here on 1027-WNAW.  1027-WNAW, Metallica, No Leaf Clover from S&M, and Jane's Addiction.  Before that, it's Opie and Anthony.  It's FU Friday.  In the studio, Jeff Norris.  Where are you guys playing tonight, Jeff?  Myself and Jim Florentine will be at the Stress Factory in New Brunswick.  So come on down.  Have a good time.  These single ladies, please show up. 
[02:12:30]  Even if you're married, show up.  Yeah, I don't have to buy you dinner.  It'll be beautiful.  Of course, Jeff does Archie on our show.  Very funny guy.  Shoot.  Yeah, yeah.  It's been a while.  Been a while.  Been through the britches like my buddy Anthony over here.  What's the matter?  These women.  Fell out of the relationship there?  I can't even go into character.  I'm so PR to display it.  There's big FU out to you, broad dad.  Look at that.  He's pissed.  I am pissed.  I, on the other hand, really can't say anything, you know. 
[02:13:00]  Should I share it?  Well, you can share whatever the hell you want.  All right.  Mind you, after I fix up this...  Fix up a house.  Burn my legs fixing up a house.  She goes out tiddlywinking with one of her little fags.  Computer jerks.  I go to...  I get a prank phone call the other day saying she's in a car accident.  I look all over every hospital.  Finally go to the house, knock on a door.  The father answers the door. 
[02:13:30]  He says, you ain't out of my property.  You come on my property.  You come in my house.  So I'm going to get a restraining order.  I'm like king of restraining orders.  I said, you're going to get a restraining order for what?  For coming on my house property.  I said, your house?  You lived in a shed before I refixed it.  So she's out there thinking, you know.  I'm set.  We'll see what happens.  I told Jeff, just pick up a fat chick.  You'll get over it.  It's a good way to bust out.  Bang yourself a fat girl.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You're going to bust out.  Clean the fatty.  Clean the palate, huh?  Exactly.  Clean the palate.  Start all over.  Do a fat fraud. 
[02:14:00]  It's like going back in the minors, you know.  You go back and regroup.  The minors, yeah.  Learn the fundamentals, you know.  And then you get back in the big boys.  It's beautiful.  The fatty.  Yeah, absolutely.  Were you listening to the divorce horror stories yesterday, Jeff?  I was listening.  I was very concerned about my buddy over here.  But much to my surprise, I come in.  I go, how you doing?  He goes, beautiful.  Fine.  So I'm doing all right.  Fine and dandy.  Doing all right.  I just look at it, you know.  I'm honored to be here.  I feel bad for her.  Maybe, you know, I'll feel a little worse after I see how bad the damage is after the 
[02:14:30]  whole thing's done.  Well, I hope you got like a five bucks I could borrow.  Well, I still got to make out that check for the cruise.  Yeah.  Jeff, you hear about this one?  You hear that one?  This is a classic.  So, you know, the end of a marriage after ten years, not that happy a thing for, you  know, for both parties.  You kind of mull it over in your head.  But, you know, my wife, feeling kind of jilted, feeling kind of bad, decides to take my American  Express card and go on a cruise down to the Caribbean, you know, book the flight down 
[02:15:00]  to Florida and take a cruise.  No, no, not just her.  She takes, on my Amex, Opie's girlfriend along with her.  No.  Damn.  Sure.  Too bad it wasn't a Titanic.  It wasn't personal, Opie, but that's okay.  It's a little rotten.  Yeah.  So, I paid for Opie's girlfriend to take a cruise.  I hope she appreciated it.  Yeah, really. 
[02:15:30]  I hope Opie got some.  Did she come back saying, my girlfriend's ex-husband brought me on a cruise and all I  brought him was this lousy t-shirt?  So, Jeff, the whole time I'm sitting there praying that Anthony doesn't find out, and  then he finally like...  You knew?  Do you believe this crap?  Oh, that's wrong.  I mean, I don't want to pay for it.  Yeah, you saved money.  Come on.  Wait, wait.  He's totally agreeing with me.  Yeah, well, saved a little money.  Hey, it wasn't my idea.  You, you, you.  It was someone else's idea that when I talked to him...  Like it was mine?  Well, it was, you know, whose idea.  So, I'm like...  So, I'm praying that Anthony doesn't find out. 
[02:16:00]  He finally confronts me, like, a month ago, and I'm like, oh, really?  Well, I didn't know about that.  That's terrible.  That's rough, man.  So, now I have to, like, write him a check for, like, 600 bucks.  That was interesting when that Amex bill came in.  Okay, parking at the garage, you know, 20 bucks a pop, dinner.  Oh, my God, I stayed at the Park of Meridian that night.  That was a couple hundred.  That was a big one.  Okay, cruise, five grand.  What? 
[02:16:30]  Jesus.  Jim has a couple of cruise tragedies, too.  Yeah?  I think it happens.  Yeah?  No, I never...  What?  I've never been on a cruise before.  Yeah, neither have I.  Yeah.  Believe me, I have no money left to go on one.  I paid for two, but I've never been on one.  No.  No, but I've been close to marriage, too, like that, so...  Lucky I didn't have it to me.  Yeah, see?  Yeah, I was ready.  I was ready to get the ring and stuff.  She said no.  So, the way I look at it, she saved me probably about 36 grand. 
[02:17:00]  Yeah.  Between, like, a condo, a ring, and paying for the wedding, so...  And a cruise for, uh...  Absolutely.  ...your friend's girlfriends.  So, now I got extra cash and hookers.  It's beautiful.  But the bad part is she left them before Christmas.  Right before Christmas.  Well, like a month before.  What's bad about that?  You don't have to...  That's it.  You don't have to get some cash for Christmas presents.  Fifteen bucks on Christmas gifts.  It was beautiful.  That was it, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I didn't have a girlfriend, but I got the new corn CD, so...  Nice.  And at least I could turn down the CD when I don't want to listen to it anymore, so...  Hey, Joe, what's up? 
[02:17:30]  Joe!  Hey, man.  Did we lose Joe?  Where'd he go?  I'm just trying to figure out if the phones are screwing up today.  They're working, right?  Let me try another one.  Hold on a second here.  Jennifer, what's going on?  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  Listen, I'm getting married April 1st.  Don't.  Congrats.  Thank you.  You are a fool.  What?  Nothing.  Plain off your date.  He might work for some people, Opie, you know?  Wow.  You can't just condemn the entire institution. 
[02:18:00]  Not everyone can buy cars to put it off.  Yeah, like Opie.  You hear what he did?  I love how we just rat each other out and stuff.  Jim don't know this.  No, this is great.  Opie, obviously, he's been going out with Sandy for how long now?  Like six and a half years.  Six and a half years.  That seven's a bitch.  In my 30s, everyone is like, when are you guys getting married?  You know, the family's putting the pressure on and stuff.  Seven is a key year in a relationship.  It's the make or break, the go or blow.  You know what I mean? 
[02:18:30]  Right.  So, yeah, a lot of people in Opie's family, a lot of people in Sandy's family, I guess,  also, wondering, when's the ring coming?  When's the ring coming?  So, last year, this was really a big issue.  But leading up to it, though, I mean, every holiday, like Valentine's Day,  oh, geez, oh, she's got a beeper.  That's probably your ex.  A beeper.  Your ex.  It's probably the father.  I just got the restraining order.  Yeah, really.  I'll fax it over to you.  Anyway, all the big, what are you, we got a radio show, you idiot. 
[02:19:00]  Look at him, he's trying to do business.  He's doing business.  Who is beeping you, Jeff?  It wasn't my beeping.  Oh, look at him, look at panic on his face.  He's writing something down.  Anyway, tell Jim the story.  Yeah, so a lot of people wonder when he's going to get engaged.  Get this move.  He buys his girlfriend a car.  Instead of the ring.  Now, she's got to be ecstatic because she's got a car.  So it takes the heat off of him for getting a ring. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah, you bought a few more months.  Right.  Yeah.  And if you figure out the price of a ring and a car, it's really, you know, not a bad move.  Especially when you talk about things like resale value will be there.  Right.  You know?  And, you know, all the big holidays come, Valentine's Day, her birthday, Christmas, and I just started running out of gifts.  Yeah.  I did the diamond rings and everything I could find.  And I'm like, well, obviously, you know, this Valentine's Day, he's got to pop the question and break out the ring.  Yeah.  You know?  But I tripped everyone and I got a car. 
[02:20:00]  A brilliant move.  But now he has to top that next time.  I know.  Ah, that's the problem.  I only got, let's see, oh my God, that's it.  I only got like four months left to try to figure out what the next big gift is.  Screw that.  I got, what, three weeks left.  Valentine's Day.  I got to get through.  Got to get something there.  That's going to hurt.  You know what you got to do?  You got to start a fight like three days before.  Right.  You know, so I usually do it, blow them off, and then I call them back like the 16th.  Like, I'm really sorry, you know.  I don't know what was going on.  Bypass the whole holiday. 
[02:20:30]  Absolutely.  That's a good move.  It's just like IGGs, yeah.  Yeah.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, yo.  I'm going to say this.  What kind of cheap Jew are you that you can let your best buddy pay for a trip?  Okay, but then I'll listen to the rest of it.  And you going on and buying her a car instead of a ring?  Oh, come on.  No, listen.  I got the best solution for you.  All right?  Wait, wait, wait.  Let me answer your first question.  All right.  As far as in I go, it all evens out.  I've made up.  It all evens out.  Hey, why don't you cash in a couple of shares of that skyrocketing stock? 
[02:21:00]  Wait, let me tell you something, though.  Pally.  All right, so you paid for Sandy's cruise, yes.  Yeah.  Who gave you a great stock tip this week?  All right.  Your broker.  Who is also my broker.  Well, why didn't he call you?  Because he called you.  Oh, why didn't he get me in at four instead of seven?  I shared the info with you when it hit seven.  Seven?  He took me out of seven.  Well, you kidding.  You could have paid for the whole cruise right there. 
[02:21:30]  Hey, yo, please.  This is what you're doing.  Yeah.  For April, right?  Yeah.  April 1st.  They stand to a nice, quiet restaurant.  Mm-hmm.  They stand to a nice, quiet restaurant.  Dessert cups, slide a ring box across the table.  Leave it empty.  When she opens it up, the April Fool's.  If she don't dump you then, she never will.  Well, it's not...  That's a great way to get dumped, man.  Go for it.  It's not a question of wanting to dump her.  I'm just not into the marriage thing yet. 
[02:22:00]  So you know what?  Try it out.  If she stays with you, then you know she's a good girl.  Stay with you for life.  I think I know she's a good girl already.  The crap she has to put up with.  I can tell you she's a good girl, too.  Yeah.  Oh, there we go.  Not even going down that road.  Thank you.  The older road.  Well, she went down that road.  All right, all right.  All right, goodbye.  Goodbye.  What were you going to say, Jim?  That might work.  She might get so mad that you did that, she might even give you the car back.  Right, right.  So try to run you over it.  The goddamn thing is what you'll do.  Yeah, but it's one of those girl chick cars. 
[02:22:30]  I can't drive them.  That's another thing.  He gets her a chick car so he can't even drive it.  Yeah, there's no reason for that.  I've got a picture of Oak in the show.  We can laugh.  I wish we could share with you guys.  Damn it.  All right.  All right.  Anyway, line seven. 
[02:23:00]  Line seven, okay.  Ted, what's going on?  All right.  Hey, you know, I have nothing about the vote because I'm kind of happily married.  But I just want to tell you, I met Jim Florentine last week at a show in South Jersey.  Yeah.  And if anybody hasn't seen him, man, he's like too funny.  Oh, cool.  Yeah.  Oh, thanks.  He's so hysterical.  I mean, he's a great emcee.  He's a great feature.  And he's like, you just laugh your ass off listening to the guy.  Well, he's playing with Jeff Norris tonight at the Stress Factory.  I'm going to try to make it there. 
[02:23:30]  Through the weekend.  Hey, Jim, this is Ted.  I met you at the Seagull Inn.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Thanks, man.  I appreciate that.  Hey, hopefully one of these days you can give me a good spot somewhere.  Absolutely.  Bring some girls.  Absolute hookers, right?  Well, yeah.  Everyone wants chicks.  You got it.  What's wrong with that?  Thanks, man.  Come down.  Bye-bye.  Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Yeah, we're at Stress Factory this week.  Very cool.  All right.  What happened to Jeff?  Is he all right?  I love this show. 
[02:24:00]  This is the best show ever.  Let me see, O.  Let me see.  This will be very funny.  Go ahead.  Rick, get on mic and just say that we're in the middle of a Worst Up show.  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Any requests for bits, give a call, 757-1027.  So we're not live, so anything that was said today happened a long time ago, right? 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Okay.  Line 12, true.  This is for you, for you, really.  Pick it up.  Hello.  Who's this, Opie?  Yeah.  You guys are getting me in trouble here.  Who's this?  Jeff Norris.  What's the problem, Jeff?  We were just playing a clip of when you were here in the studio.  I know you're playing clips, but I know Jim's there tonight.  I had an incident today.  I had to leave work.  I go to the hospital.  I phone in to talk to Jim.  My spaz says, oh, I'll put you on over the phone with Jim. 
[02:25:00]  My pager goes off.  The guys at work think I'm in the studio, and now I'm in trouble at my job.  What?  They think I'm in the studio.  Oh, no.  No, that was pre-recorded.  Well, I called in and talked to Jim about plugging the show for this weekend, and now they think I'm in trouble here.  Oh, no, no.  Well, make it clear over the air that I was not in the studio.  Oh, you tell your employers that, yeah, obviously you're on the phone.  Yeah, how could you be in the studio if you're on the phone? 
[02:25:30]  Well, when I called you from speaker from my brother's house, they hear the pager go off.  Oh, so it's that, yeah.  They heard the pager.  They think I'm there.  Hey, Jeff?  Yes?  You're screwed.  Here I am.  I mean, I had an emergency.  I was going to do the show tonight with Jim.  I call in, and now they think I'm in trouble with the job.  No, Jeff Norris was never in the studio today.  All right, Jeff.  I mean, if you guys are playing bits, do me a favor.  Say that you're playing bits, and they don't think I'm in the studio. 
[02:26:00]  You got it.  Please, because I'm in trouble.  All right, Jeff.  Make it clear that I'm in bits.  Okay.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  Who the hell is going to do that?  I didn't think he got in that much trouble.  All right, Jim.  So you guys are at the Stress Factory?  Yeah, we're at it, right?  Yeah, it is Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  At the Stress Factory.  Okay.  Be a good show, man.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  Hi, this is Jeff.  I'm on a rooftop at my work, where I'm supposed to be. 
[02:26:30]  So please tell everybody I'm really not there.  Thank you.  Hi, this is Jeff.  Calling from the cockpit of the 747.  I'm not in the studio.  It just sounded like I was in the studio.  Roger.  Now I've got no one to split the parking with. 
[02:27:00]  Very good.  All right.  On the way, Anthony.  Bit of the Week.  Yeah.  Very interesting vote at the last minute there, okay?  All right.  I'm eager to see what it is.  I think we can play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show,  and we'll end the show with Bit of the Week.  Give us a call.  212-757-1027.  Opie and Anthony.  Jack, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen. 
[02:27:30]  1027-WNEW.  1027-WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  It's F.U. Friday.  Yeah.  Boy, what a show we've had today.  We've had a lot of fun this week.  We've had a lot of fun the last three weeks, ever since we got back from vacation.  Yeah.  We all rested.  We appreciate the support.  Thank you.  It means a lot to us.  Screw everyone else.  Yeah.  Let's play a quick round of what did we learn on the Opie and Anthony show.  Then we're going to end with Bit of the Week. 
[02:28:00]  All right.  Yeah, we've got to tell everyone.  The Mike Tyson bit from earlier.  Yes.  It's Bit of the Week, Anthony.  Snuck in under the wire.  Last minute.  Hilarious.  Mike Tyson.  Audio of Mike Tyson from London.  When he was outside a window with a megaphone trying to calm down all the supporters.  Protesters, I should say.  Oh, they hate him over there.  They don't want him in their country for the fight. 
[02:28:30]  All the women's groups are up in arms.  Yeah.  And it's getting so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police station.  And he was trying to calm him down outside a window with a megaphone.  And we got the audio.  So, megaphone.  Can't understand him out of his mouth.  It's very funny.  Through a megaphone.  All right.  Let's play What Did We Learned on the Opie and Anthony Show.  EJ, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  All right.  I learned that the little Kittner boy was really eaten by Celine's gash.  And I learned that Mike Tyson spells T-E-F-F. 
[02:29:00]  Very good.  Have a good weekend, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  Let's be reasonable.  This is not the time nor place to perform some kind of a half-ass autopsy on her camel toe.  You know, he got it wrong, though.  Got to correct him.  What?  We found out that the Kittner boy was actually in Star Jones' gash.  Oh, really?  Yes.  Was that where he was?  Yes.  Remember today?  Remember Star Jones was like the big shark in Jaws?  And Quint slid into Star Jones' gash.  But he was also in Celine's gash earlier in the day, Opie. 
[02:29:30]  Oh, so there was a couple things going on there.  Okay.  You'll have to keep track of that little Kittner boy.  All right.  He's all over the damn place.  Mike, what's going on?  I learned you should always put your feet broad vibrate.  Thank you, Mike.  Thank you, sir.  Bye.  Mike.  Chime it in.  Okay.  We love this game.  Andrew, what's going on?  What did you learn on the show today?  What's up, guys? 
[02:30:00]  All right.  Yeah, I learned that a tractor trailer, T-Rex, and Opie can fit and swing beyond snatch.  Yes.  How old are you, Andrew?  Thirteen.  Very good.  You love the Opie and Anthony show.  You're a quick learner.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.  All right, bye.  We're his heroes, Opie.  All right.  Mike, you're next.  What did you learn on the show?  Like that'll make it through.  I learned that Opie can do impressions and suck in snot with the greatest of A's.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  And I also learned this week that Earl will never get a job at Lens Clafters. 
[02:30:30]  One hour.  You got money, love.  All right.  Angelo, you're next.  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  I learned that when you buy your fiancé a car, you get about 12 months' worth of freedom.  Yes.  Yeah, guys, you're great.  All right.  Thank you, Angelo.  Just a few minutes away from bit of the week, Anthony. 
[02:31:00]  Yes.  Mike Tyson.  Let's go to Anthony.  Anthony, you're next on the show.  What's up?  Yes, Opie.  Oh, a caller.  I'm sorry, Anthony.  You're all funny.  I learned that you guys got bigger balls than King Kong.  And I have one other thing to say.  Opie, how many valiums did you have to give Rick after yesterday's conversation?  I got to tell you, man, Rick and I rode the train home together.  We talked about it the whole time.  He was so freaked out.  I'm like, dude, I can't even sit next to you. 
[02:31:30]  You smell from the sweat that was pouring from your body.  Hey, you guys are the best.  You rock, man.  And the pee.  I think he peed his pants.  He smelled like Ziggy when he was leaving.  There was a fax that came in right after we went off the air that had us in stitches for 20 minutes.  Do you remember the exact wording that faxed?  Yeah.  Do you remember it?  Because I'm going to screw it up.  I remember it.  You do, Rick?  Okay, go ahead.  Guy faxed him.  Don't know his name.  He said what he learned for today that was when the going gets tough and the... 
[02:32:00]  Oh, now I...  No, when the going gets tough, O&A, send in the spit.  Send in the Puerto Rican to the front line.  Jeez, man.  All right, Anthony.  Thank you.  Hey, you guys are the best, man.  All right, bye.  Tom, you're next on the radio show.  What's up?  Hey, Hoppy.  Yeah.  I learned that you better get that prescription renewed for value.  Why?  Because you guys must have been taking it all week.  You guys were great.  Hey, Anthony.  Hey.  I'm the guy that gave you the pen at the, uh...  Who did it?  The Yankee pen?  Yeah, the Yankees. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah.  Hell yeah.  Okay, Anthony.  I'll be...  All right.  Later, man.  Okay, bye.  Derek Jeter gets $18 million a year and Hank gets a Yankee pen.  I get a little Yankee pen.  All right.  Yankee pen.  Life's fair.  Sure.  Jeff, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, guys.  I learned that Opie's sister isn't a ho-a.  A ho-a.  Hey, that's Jackie.  That's Howard, too.  Maybe I could do Robin sometime.  All right.  We can go. 
[02:33:00]  Thank you, Jeff.  Our listeners are a bunch of jackasses.  I love it.  Just like us.  And I learned if you work for a very popular radio show in New York City,  you shouldn't speak really loud enough.  In sushi restaurants.  Sushi restaurants.  Very true.  And congratulations going out to my sister once again.  The birth of her daughter.  Yes.  Jamie Lee.  Ah, yes.  Husband Mike and my sister Holly.  Very, very excited today, Anthony.  Well, it sounds like husband Mike was more excited a few months back. 
[02:33:30]  Relax, man.  He was slipping her the high, hard one.  Right, though?  You don't want to think of your sister.  You know what?  I can't even go to the phones now because that's all everyone wants to do is abuse my sister,  who's like in a hospital.  It's not a blessing.  It's just fact.  I'm sure at some point she was probably on all fours getting dogged from behind by Mike.  You know, it's just the fact.  It's the way it is.  I know you like to remember her as the little girl that was running around the house,  the little sister that you protected. 
[02:34:00]  But at some point, you know, he was slamming her.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, what's up, O&A?  Help me.  I learned not to make any family announcements on the O&A show.  Very good.  Any.  Any.  Yes, very good.  I've been listening to guys since August and 17.  I've been telling everyone.  We appreciate that.  All right.  Take care, guys.  Lord knows there's no marketing dollars available for the Opie and Anthony show.  Hell no.  Not the WWF.  Keep them.  Word of mouth is the way we're going to get anything going in this town.  I learned something today. 
[02:34:30]  All right.  Rick?  After listening to Ann talk about your sister, I think she might have a flat forehead, right?  What?  What?  No.  What is so bad?  John, what's up?  What did you learn on the show?  I learned that college kids are much safer in bed.  Oh, because the kid that slept through the fire?  Yeah.  I mean, next time the fire alarm goes off, same bed. 
[02:35:00]  All right.  Very good.  I like getting up.  Okay.  Thank you.  Thanks.  What's wrong, Ann?  Nothing.  Now the wind has been taken out of the sails.  From Rick.  Rick's comment.  I know.  All right, Rick.  Say something.  Go ahead.  No, it's all right.  Give Rick a break, man.  Can I get on the train?  No, because after what he did for us at our show yesterday, you've got to get him a little  slack, man.  I know I don't have balls to do what he did yesterday, and I certainly know you don't  have balls to go up there and have the rock two feet away from you while two guys are 
[02:35:30]  telling me he can't be on the radio show.  The best description Rick gave was when he handed the rock the phone, told him he wasn't  going to be able to come down to the studio.  They had to do the interview on the phone, and he said the rock did that neck thing he  does in the ring, you know, where he like slips his neck sideways kind of real quick,  and the eyebrow goes up and he snorts.  Yeah.  The Brumable.  Man, I'd have just, like, crapped myself at that point. 
[02:36:00]  With that, I have to give Rick a break today without a doubt.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  We've got to plug Jeff Norris' gig.  Called in to plug the Stress Factory today.  Yeah.  And his buddy Jim's in the studio.  Yeah, this Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  Actually, I've got to pick up Jeff down in Jersey in a little while.  Yeah.  So it'll be good.  We'll have a good time, man.  Jeff does good impressions.  Yeah, well, tell him to get in here at some point.  You know, we'd like to see him.  Yeah, I was going to bring him, but he's too big.  He can't fit in my car.  He's a big guy, Jeff. 
[02:36:30]  Yeah.  That's why I became friends when I first saw him.  I'm like, man, this guy's big.  I don't want to bend me over and rate me, so I've got to be friends with him.  Plus, I didn't have any corks.  Yeah.  Don't worry.  It's getting up to now.  Okay, you know, fine.  I'll give you guys your pleasure here today.  Jeff, what did you learn on the show today?  Well, we learned that nine months ago, your sister got railed royally.  I've got five more weeks until she can get it again. 
[02:37:00]  These people are brutal.  My poor sister.  Donnie, what's up?  Yeah, I learned that we didn't learn what position Opie's sister was in  when she got nailed by her.  That's nice.  Hey, David.  Hey.  What did you learn on the show?  I learned that your sister's most fertile in the doggy style.  George, what did you learn on the show today?  Yeah, I learned that no matter what position she's in, she could conceive a baby. 
[02:37:30]  Hence the flathead comment.  Thank you.  Don't try to dig it back up now, Ray.  I'm like the kid on Millionaire, trying to answer the question after he's still bummed.  Galaxia.  Hey, guys.  Hi.  Hi.  Okay, I learned how to spell chief today.  Yep.  C-E-E-F.  Very good.  Chief.  Thank you, Galaxia.  Bye, guys.  All right.  All right, with that, Ant, we've got to play Bit of the Week. 
[02:38:00]  Oh, okay.  And get our asses out of the studio.  Yeah.  We had a fun week.  I hope you enjoyed listening.  Yeah, we did have a very fun week.  Have a great weekend, action-packed, and we'll see you guys Monday at 2, all right?  Affirmative.  We leave you now with Bit of the Week.  Okay, listen.  I don't know if you've seen the audio yet, but it's all over CNN.  Mike Tyson's over there.  Is he fighting again this weekend?  I've lost track of Tyson.  I guess he's in England fighting, trying to get his boxing career on track again. 
[02:38:30]  And the people, just thrilled to have him.  Yeah.  They can't stand him.  They're outside his hotel, just protesting, saying that they should throw Mike Tyson out of England.  Mostly the women's groups, Anthony.  The women hate him.  The women hate him over there.  They don't appreciate what he's done to women over here in our country, so they feel he doesn't belong in their country.  He was put in prison for rape, raping a woman.  And then there were allegations by his girlfriends and ex-wives about abuse, all kinds of stuff. 
[02:39:00]  He should have to go back to prison for marrying the lady he's with now.  Oh, my God.  Ooh.  That's not funny.  What are you talking about?  So, on CNN, they got footage of Mike Tyson.  I guess the protesting has gotten so ugly that they had to bring Mike Tyson to a police station,  because they're just protesting wherever he goes. 
[02:39:30]  So he's out this window at the police station with a megaphone trying to talk to the lady protesters.  Well, that's what you want him to do.  Like, talk to the protesters.  That won't piss them off any more than they already are, right?  Oh, I'm sure.  Hey, hey, you limey bitches.  Any of you limey bitches want to come in here and see who could take a punch like Robin Givens?  Come here, you bitches. 
[02:40:00]  I'm going to kick your ass.  Come here.  I hope you're the first one.  Look at you, you toothless bitch.  Come here.  Get out of my face.  I'll punch you.  Come here, you pasty white English whore.  Why are they so angry at me?  Why are they angry?  Because your queen is a twat.  Come here.  Oh, look, look.  It's the queen.  Come here, queen.  Oh, you can't even take a punch. 
[02:40:30]  You're like Spinks.  You're like Spinks.  I came out of the corner and pounded him.  Now I'm going to bang the queen over a chair and do her in the caboose.  Just like I did to that Miss USA or whatever the hell it was I banged.  I went to prison for that.  I want a man in prison.  Prison.  Why do I sound like the man thought? 
[02:41:00]  I'm going to make you look like Lady Di after I'm done with you.  You're going to be bleeding.  You can rest assured.  Where's Prince Charles?  I'm going to bang you in your big ears.  Come here.  Okay, here's a fine lady.  Now I want to talk sense to you.  I have been rehabilitated.  I went to prison.  I'm just trying to get my fighting career back.  They don't look at me like that. 
[02:41:30]  What would I do?  I don't even understand.  I'm like an animal.  It's like the Beatles over there.  They're chasing him around.  Yeah, but they want to kill me.  They don't want like a water graph or nothing.  They want to kill me.  Thank God they're all too much pussies to have guns over here.  Even the police don't have them.  Here's one of them bobbies with that big stupid hat.  I'm like King Kong.  I'm just running around. 
[02:42:00]  Remember the King Kong movies?  He was in New York and he couldn't do nothing.  That's me in England.  Oh, come on.  The cops don't have guns so I can run rampant.  Come on, you bastards.  Look, I'm beating up the police.  Are they throwing soccer balls at you, Mike?  Yeah, soccer balls is all they got.  Look, I'm going to find a big guard booth in front of the palace and they got them guards with the big fuzzy hats on.  Yeah.  You can't make them change the expression on their face. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  Watch this.  See his expression now?  Now look at this.  Look, now it's a bloody expression.  I made a change.  Now I'm going to take that furry hat and stick it in your keister.  And that's only to make room for my giant member.  Look, it's Prince William.  Look at that fine young little man.  I'm going to be himself and abuse him.  I love England. 
[02:43:00]  We're the Spice Girls.  I'm going to skewer them like a shish kebab.  I'll get all of them on there at once.  Come here, you whores.  Come here, you blimey whores.  You all got bad teeth.  Your teeth, they suck.  You got the scurvy.  I got a cure for that.  Yeah, that's the cure.  You look at it.  You look at it, bitch. 
[02:43:30]  Go ahead.  You ain't never seen my Netflix.  Where's Hugh Grant?  I'm going to do him too.  Come here, whores.  All English whores.  Lady Di was a whore slut, man.  I'm just trying to be popular.  I'm like Mighty Joe Young.  Rum got ramping through the city. 
[02:44:00]  Lady Di was a slut whore.  Going out with a towel head.  Making her country all pissed off at her.  Look at me just snacking down.  He's not me.  Shut up, bitch.  Am I making any headway?  I'm waiting over the people of England.  Well, they're still a little pissed, Iron Mike.  Well, they're all stupid.  They got two TV stations that suck. 
[02:44:30]  Yeah, look at my mighty metal, you bitch.  They only got two teeth.  In that whole day.  I went to that, you know, I went to the London Zoo.  Yeah.  The other day.  Uh-huh.  And they tried to stop me from leaving.  Yeah.  Something about an escapee.  Shut up.  Sam Ferguson is a fat bitch. 
[02:45:00]  I don't care if she's on that Weight Watchers or nothing.  I make her lose weight.  I go, come here.  Come here.  You know why you eat so much?  Because your mouth works.  Yeah.  Now it don't.  Now you lose some weight.  You fat bitch.  Look, your hair's red.  So's your nose.  And now, so's your hair.  Oh, look, here's the queen.  Come here, queen. 
[02:45:30]  Right in the face.  Don't try it up, slut.  We make him hike, Tyson, live.  Try to stay in cabin, slut.  Man it up, but Rick screwed up my sound of it.  Now I'm going to go climb Big Ben and swat at aircraft. 
[02:46:00]  T'was beauty killed the beast.  Hey, it's Fay Wray.  Take me back to Skull Island.  You nasty-ass English people.  You got the big, gappy old teeth.  I love the Irish Republican Army.  I'm learning how to make car bombs. 
[02:46:30]  You people suck.  Am I winning them over?  Am I winning them over?  I don't think so, Iron Mike.  I appreciated what the Luftwaffe did.  They warped with their aircraft back in World War II.  Look at this.  I'm going to fight off Prince Charles' ears.  That's a hell of a meal.  He's got some big-ass ears that...  That is an ugly mother... 
[02:47:00]  There you go.  I bet he's got a little acorn in his pants  because his wife, the whore bag, Lady Di,  was going out with a towel head.  People of England, your Lady Di was a whore.  How am I doing?  You're not doing too well there.  He had a muff like Don King's hair. 
[02:47:30]  You're going to have a heart attack.  I'm getting more flack from you limeys  and Prince Charles is going to take it in the leather Cheerios.  Come here, Sarah Ferguson.  Bend over.  I'm going to punch you in the rectum.  That's a low blow. 
[02:48:00]  I'm going to punch you in the middle.  I'm going to punch you in the middle.  I'm going to try it in the middle.  I'm going to punch you in the middle.  Let me know if I'm...  Let me know if I'm welcome back anytime soon. 
[02:48:30]  You guys suck at the Falkland Islands.  A bunch of little Mexicans kick your ass.  James Bond's a pussy.  I better get inside.  I'm just starting to throw stuff at Mike.  Tom, what's up? 
[02:49:00]  All right, listen, that was hilarious, I got to say.  But, you know, about what you said about Princess Diana, that was pretty bad, don't you think?  Well, she's a whore bag.  The chick was a slut.  Why do you think she was in the backseat of that car?  She would give him road head to her towel-headed boyfriend.  That gappy-tooth bitch.  That's all, y'all. 
[02:49:30]  Oh, did he hang up?  He didn't like my comment, Timmy.  I hung up on him.  I didn't want anyone wrecking our buzz today.  A lady died?  In the backseat, I heard that that towel-head boyfriend or her's member was in her hand, ripped right off.  Almost like getting a punch from Mike Tyson.  That's what she would look like after one of my blows.  That's right.  She's screaming from the grave, that dead bitch. 
[02:50:00]  I heard it was caught in her teeth.  Teeth.  How do you spell teeth?  Don't ask Mike Tyson how to spell.  All right.  Mike, what's going on?  T-E-F-F.  Spell teeth.  That's all, y'all.  I'm all for violence sometimes.  Hey, you guys are bunching fools. 
[02:50:30]  God, I want to punch you in the face.  That'll leave a bruise.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
