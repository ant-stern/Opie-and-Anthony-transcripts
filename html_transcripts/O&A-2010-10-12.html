<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a detailed and humorous discussion of NHL player James Wisniewski's blatant blowjob gesture directed at Sean Avery.  The hosts dissected the incident, speculating on the NHL's response, particularly how they would explain it to children, and debating the humor versus inappropriateness of the act. This led into a broader critique of the NHL's apparent hypocrisy in focusing on child protection while ignoring the inherent violence in the sport itself. Callers contributed to the discussion, with one noting NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman's presence at the game. The segment also included a vulgar and graphic discussion of the television show *Hoarders*, complaints about technical issues with the online stream, and an angry rant about excessive toll road fees.  Patrice O'Neal was announced as an upcoming guest, and the Jocktober segment, focusing on country music, was previewed.

Next, the show launched into a furious, profanity-laced attack on a Phil Mushnick column criticizing the hosts' style of radio and its supposed contribution to teenage recklessness. The hosts, along with Sam, vehemently disagreed, using the suicide of a Rutgers student whose gay sexual encounter was webcast as a counter-example. They employed homophobic, misogynistic, and racist slurs throughout this segment. The discussion evolved into reflections on the suicide and their own broadcasting evolution.  This was followed by the "Jocktober" segment, a scathing review of a Seattle country radio show hosted by Candy and Potter.  Opie and Anthony relentlessly mocked Candy and Potter's on-air persona and their "What's your weekend in four words?" segment, utilizing listener calls, many sexually explicit and offensive, to further their mockery.  The segment ended on a note of continued vulgar commentary and ridicule.  Ira was briefly mentioned as a potential future guest.

The show then transitioned to a segment starting with Opie and Anthony expressing anger and frustration over an incident involving a female colleague, briefly touching upon consent laws before Patrice O'Neal and Big Mama Prods from Twitter arrived in studio. Opie gifted Patrice an unopened bottle of Louis XIII cognac, sparking a humorous discussion about its value, both full and empty, and Patrice's joking suggestion of refilling it with cheaper liquor.  The conversation shifted to Patrice's neighborhood, its perceived dangers, and anecdotes about a new resident's expensive car and a neighbor repeatedly having gang signs painted on his door. Patrice shared his experiences refinancing his home and a substantial mortgage reduction.  This led to observations on differences between predominantly white and black neighborhoods, focusing on architectural distinctions of fast-food restaurants and security measures.  A significant portion of the segment was devoted to Patrice recounting personal experiences of being robbed at gunpoint as a teenager and being assaulted as a child, detailing the emotional impact. The hosts discussed their own experiences with bullying and the lasting effects of childhood trauma, comparing urban and rural environments and their respective interpersonal dynamics and safety. The show concluded with further discussion of childhood violence and its lasting effects.


The final segment featured Patrice O'Neal recounting a childhood fight over a Puma tracksuit that escalated into a physical altercation involving aerobic weights, and discussed his evolving views on fighting.  The conversation then moved to Brett Favre's sexting scandal, with much speculation on Favre's penis size, followed by a similar discussion of George Lopez's divorce after his wife's kidney donation.  The hosts and Patrice criticized the perceived lack of masculinity and outspokenness in modern sports broadcasting, exemplified by commentators avoiding sensitive topics.  Lou Holtz's slurred speech and rambling commentary style on ESPN's College Game Day were heavily criticized, with listener calls weighing in.  Patrice stated his inability to watch the show due to Holtz's presence.  Finally, a promotional video for the Lingerie Football League was shown, prompting amused reactions from the hosts and Patrice.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Lou Holtz, including a listener calling in to defend him.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Shut up!  Get us back to the funny.  But first, let's play this.  People understand we don't belong in radio, right?  Satellite radio douchebags?  I take that as like a compliment.  Yes, we suck a dick.  Sorry to everybody out there.  This is fucking satellite fuck dick radio. 
[00:00:30]  Holy shit.  What a great show.  We heard you.  I don't want to make everyone feel bad,  but you know this is what old people sit around and do.  I'm pouring semen squirting and shooting up the job.  Oh, what the fuck?  This morning has been, I feel like I'm on Jerry Springer.  Enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Yeah, let's do this.  How great is that, Anthony?  It's too goddamn funny.  I just showed Anthony the greatest thing to ever happen in sports. 
[00:01:00]  That was one of the funniest.  Greatest or funniest?  Definitely funniest.  Funny and great.  That's what sports is missing.  Yep.  But they're going to beat the shit out of the kid.  Wisniewski?  Is that his name?  Yeah, and they're going to end up suspending him and all that crap.  But I say, let all this happen in sports.  Let it all happen.  For the people that haven't seen it yet, first of all, 
[00:01:30]  I went to the Islanders-Rangers game yesterday.  Islanders won 6-4 over the Dirty Rangers.  Always a fun rivalry there, I'll tell you that much.  Sean Avery took a beating yesterday.  One for the ages.  There's his number, number 16.  You see his name.  Yeah.  No mistaking.  Got in a little trouble there.  A little brawl.  Not even really a brawl.  A little talking.  A little shouting match. 
[00:02:00]  After the play, a little pushing and shoving.  Yeah, yeah.  And then...  Wisniewski?  James Wisniewski, something like that.  Yeah, Wisniewski, I guess we'll say, right?  He's a free agent for the Islanders.  We picked him up.  He decided to really give it to Avery and do the famous...  It's the universally known.  Yeah, the universal, can't mistake you for anything else,  but the blowjob gesture.  Right.  You take your hand, you make a fist, 
[00:02:30]  you tilt it at an angle toward your face,  and pump.  Yeah.  And as you pump, you make your mouth go...  Like you're singing opera.  Right.  Oh, and then you pump your hand as if to say,  hey, this is a blowjob.  Right.  As in, would you like a blowjob?  Was he saying, would you like a blowjob?  Or was he saying, blow me?  I think it's, hey, you do this.  Like it's, hey, you know, suck my dick. 
[00:03:00]  They will be playing this video clip for years to come,  and this Wazuski, Wisniewski, whatever,  everyone's going to know his name by the end of today.  And I guarantee the NHL is going to suspend this kid.  Yeah, for making a blowjob gesture.  I guarantee it, which sucks.  I say let all this happen.  How do you word that?  Huh?  How do you word that in, like, the paperwork?  He made a blowjob gesture.  They'll put some kind of inappropriate gesture. 
[00:03:30]  Well, they've been saying, like, inappropriate gesture,  but now the papers are basically saying unmistakable.  What do they say?  Oral sex?  Let me say.  Oh, unmistakable.  Oral sex.  Obscene.  Yeah, it only took two games for Sean Avery to get into his first controversy of the season.  Only this time he's not the one facing a suspension.  In the first period of the Rangers' seesaw 6-4 loss to the Islanders at the Coliseum yesterday,  Islanders defenseman James Wisniewski made an unmistakable obscene gesture at Avery  as the two were separated following the agitated wingers' spray of snow onto Islanders' goalie Rick D.B.H. 
[00:04:00]  That was the Daily News.  That's great.  That's not the one I was reading this morning.  It's funny as fuck.  But the Post decided, fuck it, let's just, you know, tell it like it is.  Go for it.  Yeah.  Oh, they buried the story, too.  Where the hell is it?  Did they?  So how are Gary Bettman and his NHL hockey operations personnel going to explain to children  what James Wisniewski mouthed and gestured at Sean Avery on the ice during the first period 
[00:04:30]  of yesterday's match at the Coliseum?  You don't have to explain anything to kids.  Shut up.  I'm so glad I'm finally a father, so I'm in on all this shit now?  No, you're in.  I don't need Gary Bettman or the NHL explaining shit to my kid, because I'll explain that shit  to my kid, and I'll explain to him how hilarious that is.  That it's hilarious.  The thing that got me the most after watching it the first ten times is how silly  it looks wearing a giant hockey glove and how it would hurt. 
[00:05:00]  Right.  I don't think you'd get much pleasure.  It wouldn't be fun to work the shaft with a hockey glove.  No, and you'd need a much bigger cock than Brett Faraveries for it to even stick out of  the top of a hockey glove.  How do you give a blowjob wearing a hockey glove?  They're huge.  Kevin from Connecticut has the translation.  He was saying, go suck another dick.  Ah.  So, I guess now the paper's saying that Gary Bettman and the NHL hockey operations personnel, 
[00:05:30]  they've got to now explain to the children, Anthony.  The children.  Because that's who's watching the NHL.  Yes, it's all about the children.  Everything is.  Fuck the adults and fuck them for enjoying something like this.  And getting a good spontaneous laugh from a player that was taunting another player.  Oh, yeah.  Who cares?  It's funny.  You know, you made a great point a long time ago, and I am a father, but you said that  they don't give a shit in entertainment about adults anymore.  It's all about protecting the children, and that's bullshit.  Let's just have some good old adult fun, things that make adults laugh. 
[00:06:00]  Which this is, right?  Yeah.  That is just hilarious.  So you cannot watch that and not laugh as a guy.  I bet you even Gary Bettman in Closed Doors, when he has to look at the tapes, he's laughing.  Look at that.  As a man, he's laughing, going, holy shit, I can't believe this.  It's like hysterical.  Because we've been through this with GMs and stuff, where they take us behind closed doors  and they laugh at us.  They laugh with us, I mean.  Yeah.  And then as soon as that door opens, it's all about, well, well, we'll make sure that 
[00:06:30]  never happens again.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Harumph.  Meanwhile, they all have it on their fucking computer to punch up and go check this out.  It's on their iPhones.  Of course.  Look at this shit.  So now.  You'll get it.  So it says, so how are Gary Bettman and his NHL hockey operations personnel going to explain  to children what James Wisniewski mouthed and gestured at Sean Avery on the ice during  the first period?  Wisniewski reportedly made signals unmistakably.  Unmistakably.  Intimating oral sex. 
[00:07:00]  Unmistakably.  Unmistakably.  Absolutely.  He was doing a pantomime.  Yeah.  So it's a great moment.  They should keep this crap in sports.  Great moment in sports right there.  Great moment in sports.  You know, but I think this guy's going to get suspended, not just for a game or two either.  Really?  Yeah.  God, they've gotten retarded, man.  They have gotten retarded.  It doesn't make sense.  It's a little fucking gesture.  I would imagine they'd suspend him for a couple weeks. 
[00:07:30]  Really?  Ten game suspension, something like that.  Ten games?  Ten games for the blowjob folk fake?  No, why?  Because everyone's talking about it today, too, which makes it even worse.  It's a black eye for hockey.  How are they portraying this on the television news?  Are they pixelating?  Are they?  You know, I don't know.  What are they doing?  I had a long day yesterday, so I didn't really get to watch the news in SportsCenter and stuff.  Maybe someone can help us out with that.  I have no idea.  I would like to know if they're pixelating, blurring, because they can't just show it, can they? 
[00:08:00]  I think that you could show it.  It's not a gesture like the finger or when you do the Italian fist up, fuck you.  So you could probably show it, but then to explain what it means showing it, then I think you get into that context area.  I think it's one of our themes on our show that we talk about over and over again.  It's like men can't be men anymore.  No, no.  It's castrated.  This hockey is a brutal sport.  They're elbowing and chipping the entire game. 
[00:08:30]  They're mouthing it around.  They're pushing each other.  They're fighting at times.  It's an ugly sport.  A lot of really hard hitting.  And fuck the gestures.  If you heard what they were saying to each other when they're fucking right next to each other, it would be horrifying to the children.  Well, that's why they really haven't miked players yet.  Oh, wait.  Imagine miking hockey players.  In any sport, we have the technology, and every once in a while they mic a player for maybe one play, and they basically tell them, okay, we're turning your mic on for 20 seconds.  Yeah.  And everyone's like on red alert, and then they turn off all the mics. 
[00:09:00]  Dude, even golf, when they use the mic on them and the guy shanks it or something, you go like, ah, fuck.  Tiger Woods had a few fucks.  Yeah, and they're like, well, one shanked into the woods, and he doesn't sound happy about that one.  You missed the brilliance of my line.  What was that?  Tiger Woods had a few fucks.  A few fucks.  Well, we all know about those.  Oh, boy, do we?  I didn't take the literal.  And what makes it worse for this incident that happened at the Coliseum yesterday, Tom in Jersey will add to it. 
[00:09:30]  Go ahead, Tom.  Hey, good boys.  I don't know why, but it just so happened Gary Bettman was in attendance at the Rangers-Islanders game last night, so he's in big trouble.  Yeah, Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the NHL, was at the Coliseum yesterday.  Oh, you don't want him there when that happens.  Oh, no.  Oh, my goodness.  Kevin from Connecticut is saying, uh, Wisniewski was merely reminding Avery to brush his teeth after the game.  I see that.  That's the universal sign of brushing your teeth. 
[00:10:00]  And then they were, um...  Good hygiene.  They were asking Scott Gordon, the Islanders coach, about the incident after the game.  Yeah.  Two guys in a row, and he's like, look, I'm not talking about it.  And then the one, he said it to the one guy, I'm not talking about it.  And then the next guy brought it up again.  So he just marched out, like, I'm not talking about this.  Yeah, what am I going to do?  Why not talk about it?  It's trouble.  See, this thing, this clip is starting to go places, man.  Oh, yeah.  This thing is going places.  It's so...  His face, his blowjob face is hysterical. 
[00:10:30]  Yeah.  Wisniewski...  Wisniewski...  Not only was he...  He makes the funniest blowjob face.  Not only was he doing the hand motion, I would dare say perfectly, his head was going back  and forth perfectly.  His head was bobbing, and his mouth was in the perfect...  Oh, my...  I love talking about this stuff.  It's hysterical.  When it comes to sports, I love all this stuff.  Oh, God, yeah.  I fucking hate sportsmanship, all that.  I want to see this.  I want to see dirty fights, dirty hitting. 
[00:11:00]  I want to see these blowjob gestures.  We're old school.  Wisniewski making his O face.  Oh.  And it goes right back to your point.  We got to protect the children.  This is what this is about.  Protect the children.  Fuck the adults and them enjoying it and knowing what this is all about.  And this isn't going to affect any adult's life today.  Any kid watching a hockey game and actually picking up on that has probably seen it in  school 800 times.  Of course.  Done it in school.  We got to make believe.  The new girl...  The girl comes in after summer vacation.  She's got brand new little boobies. 
[00:11:30]  Noobs.  And the boy walks up.  He goes, hey, oh, oh, oh.  Yeah.  And makes the blowjob, the universal blowjob motion.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's...  I mean...  It's...  His head kept going up.  Danny, did you make that gif?  No.  Oh, someone already made it?  I was ready.  It's just looped a thousand times.  It's already looped.  It's the new meat spin.  It really is.  Wow.  This clip is one for the ages.  That's funny.  And Avery's sitting there like, aren't you going to do something about this?  Hey!  Avery's got to relax. 
[00:12:00]  He's gotten away with murder on the ice over the years.  Let me say hi to Danny in Manhattan.  Danny.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Hey, man.  I don't know if you remember.  Avery left the Rangers a couple years ago.  He signed a big contract with the Stars.  And he said sloppy seconds about Alicia Cuspert.  Oh!  That was him?  Yeah, of course that was him.  Remember the sloppy seconds line?  And that wasn't even on the ice, and he got suspended how long there, Danny?  I don't remember anymore.  I think the league suspended him like 12 games, but he also got kicked off the team. 
[00:12:30]  They couldn't avoid his contract, but they got rid of him.  That's how he wound up back on the Rangers.  Yeah, they said fuck this guy.  Yeah, I remember that one.  And this wasn't even something that happened on the ice.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, boy, yeah.  So this guy's really fucked.  Got it on the ice.  Obscene gesture.  Yeah.  Wow.  All right.  Thank you, Danny.  Uh, let me say hi to Mike in New York.  Mike.  Morning, O.  Hey, man.  Did it make the Jumbotron after the commercial break? 
[00:13:00]  Oh, that's hilarious.  Yeah, did everyone look up to see the blowjob move and see a commercial?  So it's my second game of the season, and the audio's still out of sync with the video.  So they weren't listening to me.  And I gave them some free consulting yesterday.  And I also tweeted a picture of my Capital One coffee next to a box of Capital One popcorn for everybody.  Thank God for Capital One.  Sponsoring everything.  Capital One napkins, too.  I forgot about. 
[00:13:30]  And no one would eat the hot dogs yesterday because we saw, you know, how hot dogs were made.  Yeah.  That ruined it for me.  No more hot dogs for me.  So, yeah.  So Gary Bettman was at the game, and that happens.  When the boss is there, you don't want to fuck up with that.  You get excited because you're thinking, oh, man, this is like old school stuff.  This is why, like, some of this stuff is why I got into sports.  Taunting.  The trash talking.  All that.  Fucked sportsmanship.  The reason, like, the next time the two got out on the ice, they went directly for each other's throats. 
[00:14:00]  And just sort of punching the shit out of each other for something that happened in the first period.  These athletes are going to have to become ventriloquists or something.  Ventriloquists.  Yeah.  Don't move your mouth.  Right.  Don't move your mouth because they might pick up on that and it's suspension.  Hey, cuck sucker.  Hey, cuck sucker.  Right.  Fuck you.  Suck my cock.  Right.  You know, as far as football goes, when they're just celebrating and acting like complete assholes.  I love it.  Don't do it too much.  I love it.  Don't come up with a brand new dancey dance. 
[00:14:30]  Let's say hi to Chris, a girl in Iowa.  Chris, a girl in Iowa.  What's up?  Oh, my God.  We're worried about the fucking children.  The sport itself is full of violence and blood on the ice and the faces being shoved up against the plastic.  I mean, are we explaining to the children about the violence in hockey and football and shit?  Oh, my God.  It's part of the sport.  Yeah, that's what's weird.  At the game yesterday, I think there was only one fight, I believe, and the fight went on forever. 
[00:15:00]  It was the longest hockey fight I think I've ever seen.  It just kept going and going.  They just wouldn't separate these guys.  They wouldn't separate or fall down.  And then they had the blowjob gesture.  And if you really want to break this down, wouldn't the violence in the big time, that big fight be way worse than this?  Yes.  But, of course, they understand they can't, like, totally get rid of fighting in hockey.  Yeah.  Yeah, then it would really fall.  But this, you watch what happens to this guy.  I think they should say that's fine.  Any gestures people want to make, we're introducing that to hockey. 
[00:15:30]  Right.  So if you want to make a handjob gesture, blowjob gesture, squeeze my tits gesture, diddle my clit gesture.  Well, it shut Avery down because, you know, you would think he would go after this guy the rest of the game.  He didn't fucking touch him.  He didn't, huh?  He didn't go after him or nothing.  You don't want to see that expression again?  I don't know.  I don't know what that's about.  I don't know what that's about either.  But it shut him right the fuck down.  And Avery takes on everybody. 
[00:16:00]  Even though I'm an Islanders fan, I kind of like Avery.  I kind of like how he plays.  Because it goes with my theme today.  You know, old school sports.  I like those guys.  And as far as the children go, as far as the children, I got a kid.  I don't need, I don't, I'm not going to worry about Bettman and the NHL explaining this to my kid.  It's much nicer, I believe, to get a blowjob than to be punched in the face.  You know what?  Now you're talking.  I mean, honestly, it feels a little better there. 
[00:16:30]  Now you're talking.  It's not gay if you're avoiding a fight.  Yes.  Good question.  Is this Wisniewski guy a good player?  I have to be honest.  We just picked him up.  I don't know much about him.  I really don't.  What is he, like assistant captain or something?  I believe so, yeah.  How did he fucking get that if he's just like in?  Well, because the whole team is brand new this year.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah. 
[00:17:00]  I've spent the last two games, the first two games, just studying the players and getting to know them again.  Yeah, yeah.  That's fucked up part of a new season.  Almost cleared house again.  We got a lot of new players.  Yeah, a new season with a fan of the team.  You got a lot of new players again.  Who the fuck is this guy?  Is he any good?  Yeah.  Fucking what?  So my voice is shocked because then I stayed up to watch the Jets and I was in and out of sleep because of that lightning.  Holy crap.  That was some crazy fucking primal shit going on last night. 
[00:17:30]  We had hail.  We had lightning storms.  Yeah.  Heavy rain again in the New York area.  And it was weird.  I didn't know they did this, but the Jets, Vikings, of course, Monday Night Football and Favere fucking blew it on that final drive, throwing an interception.  Jets win.  Whoopsie.  Jets win.  Favere fucking just shit the bed.  Yeah.  But I didn't know this.  When there's lightning in the area, they have to clear out the stadiums. 
[00:18:00]  Did you know this?  They put them all where?  What?  Where do they put them?  Oh, the stadiums themselves?  They clear.  They move the stadium.  Now, where do they put the people?  All the people have to leave their seats and go in the concourse area.  The Rotunda concourse, whatever you want to call it, yeah.  But you would think these state-of-the-art brand-new stadiums have that shit figured out, these open-air stadiums.  But no, lightning in the area, you've got to get the fuck out of your seat.  Wow, it's fucked up.  So they pushed everyone out.  That's got to take forever.  You think? 
[00:18:30]  What was there, 80,000 people there maybe last night?  And you know people just are stupid and can't figure out how to cooperate and walk in a line or fucking do anything right.  So when it was time for the game to actually start, they're showing the stadium, there's no one in there.  No.  Because they had to push them all out and wait for the lightning to pass by.  Oh, fuck.  Yeah.  Yeah, that takes a while.  Yeah.  Well, yeah, the Jets, you know, I say my Jets.  Of course.  My Jets, what, 4-1 now?  4-1.  Amazing. 
[00:19:00]  Could very easily be 5-0, but that's okay.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I told everyone we lost that first game just to lull everybody.  Yeah, yeah, false sense of security.  False sense of security.  Makes them think, well, the Jets are done this season, and then, bam, you just come out and you just wipe everybody out.  Yeah, we're doing all right so far.  Oh, it's fantastic.  Let's not jinx it.  4-1.  I have no idea.  Huh?  I have no idea.  No?  Did you watch?  Yeah, I was watching.  I was switching over to Hoarders.  Of course. 
[00:19:30]  People remind me that Hoarders were on last night.  My God, there was one I saw last night where I really wanted to pull an Elvis and just shoot my television.  Oh, really?  I wanted to be Elvis Presley and shoot my television.  A woman was freaking out.  Freaking out.  Because someone threw away, without asking her permission, her Star Wars Mr. Potato Head called Darth Tater. 
[00:20:00]  She fucking runs to the truck crying.  Crying!  And pulls it out and goes, this is why I don't want people in my house doing this!  You threw this away!  And she's holding it toward the camera like we're all supposed to go, we at home are supposed to gasp.  Right.  And go, they almost threw away Darth Tater!  Not Darth Tater.  Darth Tater!  This lunatic who has, like, kids and fucking... 
[00:20:30]  I saw two Hoarders last night, both of which had these fat husbands laying there with oxygen on in bed.  Oh, really?  With just nothing but junk all over them.  And the woman is just, uh...  Well, you know, uh, things did...  I love how they talk, too.  A bit out of hand.  Yeah, well, I do like collecting.  They call it collecting things.  Oh, yeah, you collect shit.  You collect, uh, doo-doo and dead cats. 
[00:21:00]  Unbelievable.  Is that Darth Tater?  That's Darth Tater.  She almost lost Darth Tater!  God, you know how much stuff I could break?  I gotta open up a business.  I could take care of your hoarder for you.  Take care of the hoarder.  I don't...  I hate the fucking coddling.  And I watch all the new ones, and it's the same thing.  Hi, how are you?  Let's go inside.  Now, tell me a little bit about this room. 
[00:21:30]  Oh, it's a fucking pigsty!  Right.  I wouldn't be like that.  He'd walk in and go, oh, uh, by the way, this is the slovenly fucking surroundings you live in?  Yeah.  Are you fucking embarrassed, you pig?  Hey, pig, look at me.  Pig!  Are you embarrassed?  Tell me about this room as it's basically a pile of shit.  It's a pile of shit.  And I mean shit, shit.  And then they're like, well...  Because they're all toothless fucking white trash.  Well, it started out as a dining room, but, um... 
[00:22:00]  Yes, you see, things got a little cluttered and out of hand.  Cluttered and out of hand, yes.  Okay.  Yes, okay.  Here's what we're going to do.  We're going to start the cleaning process.  But everyone knows nothing's getting thrown away without your permission.  I want to keep that bowl!  Now, the bowl is cracked in half.  It's two pieces of a bowl.  But I mixed something for my dead father in it 40 years ago!  Oh, God, shut up! 
[00:22:30]  You want to kill them!  Yeah, I have a tough time watching that show, as we all know.  Oh, it's rough.  It's rough.  What happened to Darth Tater, though?  She saved Darth Tater.  Yeah?  She pulled Darth Tater from the truck and recovered Darth Tater.  But, um, she was a crate...  Now, look, I am, uh, you know, no, uh, no sympathy lost about 9-11 with me.  I am a big, like, you know, remember, never forget. 
[00:23:00]  This woman lost a cousin who was a fireman, and just also lost her fucking marbles over it.  I mean, went fucking bullshit, batshit crazy.  The hoarder?  Yeah.  So she wasn't a hoarder before the 9-11 thing?  Well, she kind of was.  Can we blame the terrorists?  Yeah, blame the terrorists.  We have to blame the terrorists.  They won.  They won in this case.  She had...  We gotta avoid this.  She had, like, fire truck toys in her house, and every... she had glassware that was red,  white, and blue, but everywhere, all over her house, and the junk, just the basic junk. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  And, uh, she had this crystal, uh, uh, thing that you saw them selling right after 9-11.  Like, it's the Crystal World Trade Center with all the... it's majesty and blah-de-blah.  I forgot all the cocksuckers that came out of the woodwork to sell shit.  Douchebags.  I forgot about those people.  We did a whole fucking show on that.  Oh, this fucking... just... just... ugh.  That was... yeah, that's it.  Okay.  That's exactly the fucking thing.  We're looking at a picture of it.  Uh, she had one of these, and, um, after the crews left, the house was all clean, and 
[00:24:00]  she's like, well, it's great that my daughters have their room back, and, uh, we're able  to eat, uh, dinner together and everything, and then they show this thing, but one thing  happened that she didn't notice until the crews left, but the camera was still, like,  rolling on her.  Someone broke my tower!  Someone cracked the fucking corner off of it.  Is that how it ended?  Like, some great Twilight Zone episode?  She's like, I knew not to let motherfuckers in my house! 
[00:24:30]  You motherfuckers!  And she's, like, beep, beep, beep.  Did they film it where the camera was on the ground as she's cursing God above?  What?  And then the credits roll?  It was fantastic.  To be continued.  It was fantastic.  Oh, that, that, that rules.  It's always something with these people as far as the, uh, it's a relative that died.  One guy had a van underneath a blue tarp that his father died in, in the van.  I didn't know if it was an accident or not. 
[00:25:00]  Is the father still in there?  I, I, yeah, yeah.  Who the fuck knows?  It was under a tarp.  I don't think so.  Right.  But the guy would not get rid of the van.  And, and, uh, he had to clean up the yard.  And now they're getting into people that are, which is an odd thing.  Look, I hate the fucking hoarders.  I'd rather just blowtorch their house or explode it, whatever.  But it's an odd thing that's happening.  Uh, they find the people, uh, if they make this mess in their yard and shit.  And then they actually say, you're, if you don't have this clean in like 30 days, you're 
[00:25:30]  going to jail.  And I'm thinking like, wow, it, it is your own fucking property.  Right.  Uh, I understand the neighbors hate it and shit, but it's something that's got to be dealt  with.  But the idea that you can be put in jail for making a mess in your house is really kind  of odd and kind of the government really kind of stepping in and taking you out of your  house.  It's a conspiracy.  It's the freedom that we have in America.  Yeah.  We talk about the freedom that you don't have to do anything. 
[00:26:00]  Absolutely.  Don't have, we live in a free country that nah, not really.  I was listening to the national anthem before the hockey game yesterday.  Thinking, thinking to myself, does this song even make sense anymore?  Let me really break it down.  Let me think about this.  When this song came about, what?  Yeah.  When, when, when did the national anthem come about?  Uh, was that the 1800s one?  No, that was the 1812, the war of 1812.  You sure?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was the one.  So I'm sure the song.  Francis Scott Key. 
[00:26:30]  I'm sure, uh, the song made a lot more sense back then.  Back then.  Yeah, yeah.  You listen to it now, I'm like, really?  Hmm.  All right.  Is that really it?  Eh, do we have freedom?  Eh, can I still hunt for my own food if I want to?  I don't think so.  I don't think so.  I think you could go to certain places if you have a permit.  Right.  And, uh, you pay the government agency some money in just a certain time of the year.  Everything's a permit.  And only a certain amount of, of what you're hunting you can hunt.  Everything's a fucking permit.  And certain weapons.  And, yeah.  You know, when I was on vacation in North Carolina, you know, on the beach, we've talked 
[00:27:00]  about it a little bit, we needed fishing licenses just to throw our stupid poles in  the water to kill an hour?  Do you really think Andy Griffith and little Opie going down to the lake at the beginning  of the Andy Griffith show had to get a permit?  Of course not.  No, it was all...  Right.  With their little fishing poles.  Right.  Just another way to grab a few more bucks out of your pocket.  Yeah, we have our poles.  We're not big-time fishermen, like, hoping for the big catch.  We're just killing time, drinking a few beers at the end of the day. 
[00:27:30]  We want to throw our poles in the water.  And we have to look to our left and our right, because we don't have the fishing permits.  Yeah, the fucking game guy will come up to you and fucking...  And kill you.  The ranger.  And by the way, we didn't get even a bite, so it didn't matter in the end anyway.  Yeah, but it matters to them.  In Nassau County, you've got to have something called a leisure pass.  What's a leisure pass?  Oh, B, it's a leisure pass.  You need it to do anything.  What?  There it is.  You have a leisure pass?  Look, it's a leisure pass.  You know what it's called?  A tax.  Mm-hmm. 
[00:28:00]  And it's needed to go to the range.  Why?  You need a little leisure pass.  Why?  Exactly, because I'm paying the range.  Right.  I'm paying them to go in.  It's not like, oh, I have a leisure pass.  I'll get them for free.  But you need one, and you need one to use any of the public facilities in Nassau County.  So they get an extra, whatever it costs, 20-some-odd dollars to buy this leisure pass from everyone  who wants to do anything.  What asshole politician came up with this?  That's why I hate them all, man.  You go rah-rah for your side. 
[00:28:30]  I think it was before Magnano came.  Good luck to you.  Good luck to you, Anthony, and your side.  It was the previous guy.  Yeah, but it's all these leisure passes, and they're all taxes under the guise of like,  hey, it's not a tax.  It's a leisure pass.  Doesn't that sound fun?  Can you still go to the beach or a park without a leisure pass?  A leisure pass?  It'll cost you extra.  What are you talking about?  Now you've got to pay more because you didn't pay more.  That's what it is.  And they probably penalize you for not having the leisure pass.  So instead of having a lousy $20 pass, now it's like, well, because you don't have it, 
[00:29:00]  it's going to be $200.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah, even more.  Right.  You know, the service charge is just out of control.  To go to the range, it costs, you know, X amount of dollars to get into the range.  And then if you don't have a leisure pass, you've got to pay more to get into the range  every time.  Jesus.  So non-residents who don't have a leisure pass, they have to pay extra.  And that's because Nassau County is fucked up with all their funds.  Is that non-resident?  No leisure pass?  $15.  It's $7 for an adult. 
[00:29:30]  And then if you don't have a leisure pass, it's $15.  So it's more than double without the fucking leisure pass.  It's a tax.  It's a fucking tax.  Fuck, I hate these, Paul.  I hate them all, Ant.  I was telling someone yesterday, there might be one or two politicians out there I might  like if I cared enough to, like, study them, but I hate them all.  I'm just pulling R.  R, change.  Obama wants change?  Change it again, motherfucker.  I didn't like the two years of change that just took place. 
[00:30:00]  So change it again, Election Day.  Yay!  Pulling all the R's.  Whap!  Whap!  Whap!  Get the fuck out!  R!  All Democrats out of the house.  R for retards.  That's it.  Yeah, retards.  And then D is for dummies.  But, you know, I want retards this time.  Dummies out, retards in.  Let's see how the retards do for two years.  And then dummies back in.  Yeah, exactly.  Exactly.  A leisure pass.  Now I'm going to be bothered by that all day. 
[00:30:30]  Leisure pass.  That's the stuff that really...  It's fun.  It's leisure.  It just drives me nuts.  Oh, but leisure sounds fun.  You know, I was easy passing my ass off over the weekend.  I forgot where I was going.  Where the fuck was I going?  I don't even remember where I was going.  It was my...  Threw a toll, apparently.  And I forgot to put my easy pass up on the dashboard.  So now I know I'm going to get that thing in the mail with...  You know, it was a lousy 75 cent toll.  And I have easy pass, but it wasn't up on the dashboard.  So now it's going to cost me, what, $50 and 75 cents because they have, like, a $50 surcharge 
[00:31:00]  if you forget to put your easy pass up on the dashboard.  How is that legal?  They're looking to get rid of some of these toll takers.  There's one bridge.  I can't remember which one it is.  Smaller one, though, here in New York City.  And they're pulling all fucking toll people out of it.  So you either need an easy pass or they're using video identification of your car, and  then they will mail you a bill.  Right.  Which, to me, sounds very expensive. 
[00:31:30]  But they were also going to charge easy pass people 10% more until they realized, why would  you penalize the people that are making traffic flow more smoothly?  So then they decided, well, we better penalize the people that don't have an easy pass 10%.  You flip-flop that much, it just shows that someone's not even fucking thinking.  No, they're thinking, but they don't care about the individual whatsoever.  No, no.  They don't give a shit about you. 
[00:32:00]  That makes no difference.  But they represent us, Opie.  They represent us.  They're supposed to do our bidding.  Really?  That's why we're paying ridiculous taxes on shit, because apparently I didn't want it,  but everyone else did.  Oh, that's right.  No, they didn't.  I was at the Huntington Fall Festival, and there was a lot of local politicians there.  Oh, yeah.  I actually had a chick in some hands.  And they're coming up to everybody, and at one point I just went, ugh, to a guy right  to his face.  Good.  Just because he was a politician.  Yeah.  A little smarmy, slimy in their suit with a smile. 
[00:32:30]  Hi, how you doing?  I'm dummy, and I'm running for shit fuck.  And you're just like, ugh, get away.  All afternoon I was just avoiding them, but at one point I couldn't help.  I just let out a, ugh, to the guy.  He didn't even know how to respond to a, ugh.  Yeah, I saw that fucking Amato once, or D'Amato.  I saw D'Amato once down at the Oyster Fest down there, and I was just like, I just looked  and went like, ugh.  He's surrounded by all his cronies, and he's shaking hands and handing out pamphlets. 
[00:33:00]  Ugh, yuck.  Someone is asking, oh, Vince, what's up, Vince, from Bayonne.  Honest question for Ope, why don't you just leave the easy pass on your windshield?  That's true.  I don't know, I feel like some animal's gonna just like, you know, break my window and grab  it or something.  Oh, oh, like a-  I really do.  A thief?  Yeah.  Eh.  So, and I didn't put the Velcro on the dashboard where it just sticks nice, so when I'm going  through, I just put it up there, and then I put it down this nice slot under my radio. 
[00:33:30]  Ah.  That it fits perfectly in.  I just leave it on the Velcro and the windshield, fuck it.  Yeah, I don't know why I don't do that.  Fuck it.  I mean, it's got me-  You don't even think about it.  It's screwed me a few times now.  Great game that you play, though, man, where it's like, how close can that fucking thing  get to my windshield before it goes up?  I've just missed.  And once I hit the fucking thing, like my easy pass didn't work, and it just went  thawed right onto my windshield.  Nice.  And the guy's like, hey, hey, hey! 
[00:34:00]  Dang!  That's when they get to be like the fucking big man.  Yeah.  Oh, right.  Big man with your uniform.  Big fucking man.  You see the guys that are hanging out outside the tunnel?  Yeah.  The transit workers?  You think you're a fucking authority figure?  Yeah, here you go, you big fucking man.  Those guys seem like fucking assholes.  Yeah.  They really do.  Maybe there's a few that listen to our show.  I don't know.  If you listen to our show, then you're not an asshole, obviously.  But the rest of them are.  Yeah, the rest of them are.  Or all of a sudden they hold up traffic dramatically because they got to walk across a couple lanes. 
[00:34:30]  But they take their time on purpose.  It is.  You know they're doing it on purpose.  I hate when you know when someone's doing something on purpose to you.  They will never fucking rush.  Or even, they'll go slow on purpose.  Of course they will.  Every fucking time, you're just trying to get through, they'll shut down one of the lanes and slowly saunter.  Yeah.  And then they hold you up.  Like, even though they're back on the, like, sidewalk part where they're safe, they'll still hold you up and then go, all right, now you can go. 
[00:35:00]  It's like, look, I wasn't going to go until you fucking got up there.  Don't worry about it.  Relax, asshole.  And they'll hold you back that extra second, you know what I mean, to kind of make it hurt a little bit.  Like, really?  This is what you got to do?  To feel good about yourself every day?  Yeah.  You got to play the Buscemi.  Of course.  Go back on that one, Danny, a little bit.  Yeah, this is great.  I love Buscemi going through the fucking parking thing.  Fargo.  It's just like the tolls. 
[00:35:30]  Hi.  How you doing?  Yeah, I decided not to park here.  Decided not to park here.  Well, what do you mean?  You decided not to park here?  Yeah, I just came in.  I decided not to park here, so.  But, well, I'm sorry, sir.  Yeah, I decided not to.  I, uh, you know, I'm not, uh, I decided not to take the trip, as it turns out, so.  Well, I'm sorry, sir.  We still got to charge you the four dollars.  I just pulled in here.  I just fucking pulled in here.  Well, but, see, there's, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. 
[00:36:00]  Long-term parking charges by the day.  I guess you'd think you're, uh, you know, like an authority figure.  That stupid fucking uniform, huh, buddy?  King clip-on tie there.  Big fucking man, huh?  King clip-on tie there.  These are all the way to your life, man.  Rule of your little fucking gate here.  Here.  Here's your four dollars, you pathetic piece of shit.  Perfect.  Fucking perfect. 
[00:36:30]  King clip-on tie.  Tie, big fucking man.  King clip-on tie.  Perfect.  That is perfect.  Yeah.  I love that.  I got to handle, uh, Tom in Philly.  Go ahead, Tom.  O.P., I'm usually always on your side, dude, but every one of you motherfuckers who has your  easy pass not on the windshield, you hold it up against the windshield, and then you wait  for the little green light, and sometimes it doesn't go, and you're hitting your fucking  brakes.  Put it on the fucking windshield.  Well, Tom, you would be correct, but in this case, I zipped through at 60 miles an hour 
[00:37:00]  as one of those that you just keep going, and I forgot to put it up on the dashboard.  It wasn't one with a gate or any of that crap.  Why don't you get the one that mounts on your license plate?  Oh, the license plate one.  That way you don't even got to worry about it.  It's not a bad idea.  Fuck that.  See?  Fuck that.  It's like a big fucking...  That looks gay.  Because there are times...  Are you allowed to say that still?  That looks gay.  That looks gay. 
[00:37:30]  You might upset some people.  Yeah.  Like Travis.  Travis is gay?  Travis, he's so gay.  Yeah, he fucking follows the Canadians.  He has to be.  Sucks my dick all the time.  Habs.  Ah.  It is true, though.  The guy doesn't make a point.  There are some people that go through that easy pass, and I'm not talking about the fast  lane ones.  I always get behind those guys.  When you pull up to the toll, it's like potluck.  It's like a little fucking...  Yeah.  It's like a game show.  Yeah.  You don't know.  And I always get behind the guy that doesn't have an easy pass, didn't realize it was an 
[00:38:00]  easy pass lane in a lot of cases.  You're like, no.  I always leave enough room so I can switch lanes real fast.  I don't trust anybody.  It's also, the fucking people, though, that have it, it's set up fine, they go, they come  to a full stop, the gate goes up, they have to wait for the little green light, and then  they go.  Now, I understand this is a matter of seconds, people.  I'm not freaking out like a madman.  But it annoys me to no end, because it's like, you can roll through that fucker.  And, I don't think, if there's a car in front of me, I ain't waiting for the gate to fucking 
[00:38:30]  come down.  I'm choo-choo training right through with the motherfucker.  Wait, you could choo-choo train through?  Yes!  It stays up when you got an easy pass.  It's fantastic.  I thought it was one of these click things.  It's got to go back down to register you.  They don't like it.  They don't like when you do it.  Oh, that's nice.  And then, today, going through the Midtown Tunnel, I had the joy, the privilege, of being  behind an NYPD car with a guy in front of the NYPD car. 
[00:39:00]  So, all I did was smash my brakes, trying to stay at exactly 25 miles an hour, because  the van, Perish the Thought, does 27 miles an hour, with a cop behind him, thinks he's  going to get pulled over in the tunnel.  When the cop is frustrated, too.  The cop is pissed.  He wants to move.  Because he's just a guy in a car, too.  He doesn't want to be behind a slow guy.  You know, I understand you can't shoot through there like one of the fighters coming out  of the Galactica, but fuck, you know, get out of the, go a little faster. 
[00:39:30]  Christ.  People.  Yuck.  All right.  So, that's how we start today.  Yes.  Brett Favre blew it yesterday.  Brett Favre, a little blowjob action in the hockey, a little fucking hoarders.  Blowjob gesture.  Yes.  I can't believe people haven't seen that yet.  People are saying tweet it.  I tweeted it yesterday.  Look for it.  If you have the ability to look at tweets, you have the ability to look at the fucking  clip. 
[00:40:00]  Let me just look really fast here, Anthony, for the people at home.  People are crazy.  Darth Tater.  We're talking about Darth Tate.  Darth Tater.  She was freaking out at Darth Tater.  That's going to make me laugh all day.  I love Darth Tater.  Darth Tater.  Look, if you go to my Twitter, OP Radio, it's the second tweet in.  You can see the blowjob gesture.  I tweeted yesterday.  But you guys should be able to find this shit on your own.  Oh, I also saw Kevin Connolly at the game yesterday.  He's a huge Islander fan or Islanders fan of Entourage. 
[00:40:30]  Yes.  Entourage fame.  I felt like Jimmy.  I was.  I took a picture of him.  Get a picture?  All blurry and stuff.  Yeah.  You know.  You didn't set it up like Jimmy does.  No.  No.  I didn't take it with him.  Oh.  Oh.  I was the creep putting up my phone real fast and getting a picture of a celebrity.  Yeah.  Patrice O'Neal is going to be in today.  Patrickey.  Very happy about that.  Patrice is a good egg.  He'll be here at 730.  So maybe what we can do next, Ant, is seg right into Jocktober. 
[00:41:00]  Get that out of the way.  Right.  That way you don't have to worry about it.  Because Patrice will have a lot to say.  He doesn't need Jocktober.  No.  Jocktober is pretty much filler for me and you.  We know that, right?  Of course.  Of course.  It's a month of filler.  It's the bestest month ever.  We go to Seattle today.  Seattle?  We go to Seattle today for Jocktober.  Two hits for the room or pop?  You want me to tell you what format or you want to be surprised?  Tell me the format.  Country.  Country.  Holy shit.  Have we ever done a country Jocktober?  I don't know. 
[00:41:30]  We might have to do the country bit if Patrice is here today.  Looking at the top ten country songs in America and trying to figure out what they're singing about.  What they're singing.  That is a great bit.  We haven't done that in a while.  Maybe if we get all the news and all that shit out of the way, we could do some of that radio today for everybody.  So we'll see what happens to, what's his name there on the Islanders?  Wisniewski.  Wisniewski.  Wisniewski.  What do you think?  What's your prediction? 
[00:42:00]  Blowjob gesture to Avery.  Everyone's watching the video.  I don't know enough about hockey rules and how strict they are with shit like that to know what they'll do to them.  I think the gesture itself is so awkward that they might just want to forget about it.  Like if they make a big deal about it, it's going to be all over the news and everything.  Just ignore that happen?  Ignore it.  Maybe they'll fine them.  Because you know what?  I don't know.  Wow, I like your take on this because I don't think they could show it on TV. 
[00:42:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if they can.  And no one called to tell me that they did see it on TV as far as like ESPN or whatever.  But if something happens, now they're going to be like, you've got to show it.  And then they show it all pixelated, making it even worse for the NHL.  Yeah, the lucky ones.  Wow, maybe they just let it go.  Maybe they just say, we didn't see nothing.  No fucking way.  I haven't seen nothing.  No fucking way.  They've got to do something.  And I bet you they'd do something harsh.  A few games.  A few games suspension.  Imagine if he had to blow Avery. 
[00:43:00]  It's like the penalty.  Well, hey, you offered.  Oh, that's a great one.  That's a great sports club.  All right, man.  We're just getting warmed up.  Stay there.  Yeah.  Silver Sun pickups. 
[00:43:30]  Opie and Anthony.  Because they were asking yesterday, Anthony.  Yeah.  Kentucky Musket.  The online feed is fucked up.  Donnie Bear from Allentown. 
[00:44:00]  What the hell is going on?  I'm hearing two different shows.  Are they closing all the factories down?  In Allentown.  I just, I want to know.  Here in Allentown.  Pete in Virginia.  The internet feed is all messed up.  This morning, about every five to ten minutes, it goes to Ron and Fez.  Dave in Bethlehem.  Now it jumped to the beginning of the show with a British dude.  That's exactly what we had planned.  Yeah.  See, it's going just as planned. 
[00:44:30]  Butt gives from Jersey.  Internet feed is fucked up.  And one more Jersey hitman writes, online feed switched to Jimmy interviewing some British dude.  So, there you go.  All right.  At least he got Jimmy.  I had a meeting in the elevator yesterday after the show.  Yeah.  Perfect place to have meetings.  And they said, look.  It really is.  We've done some research and the internet feed is working just fine.  So, I don't know.  There you go.  There's some instant feedback on the internet feed.  I'm willing to go out on a limb here and say, I think it's everybody that's complaining about the internet feed is fucking up and doesn't know how to work the computer. 
[00:45:00]  Perfect.  And they have completely screwed it up.  They're listening to another show.  They fucking, their computer has a virus, something.  Because we're fine here.  So, you people just, you know, shut up.  There you go.  So, I don't know.  Maybe they'll try to figure it out today.  Something is weird.  Because they go, look, every time we look into it, it seems like it's working fine.  I'm like, hmm. 
[00:45:30]  Then I have the argument.  I'm like, but it's not working fine because we're getting a lot of complaints every day.  So, obviously, something's going on.  Yeah.  So, we've got to go deeper into the situation here to try to figure it out.  Maybe it's a certain phone it's happening to.  Maybe it's third-party software.  I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know that shit.  I don't either.  All I know is that something's wrong with the feed because we hear about it every morning.  So, let's try to figure it out for the people out there.  Oh, I don't know.  It's all so confusing with all the computer stuff.  You see the commercials of the old people phones? 
[00:46:00]  Yeah.  I love those goddamn things.  How complicated is this?  It's like, hey.  There's one where a guy calls up his brother, I guess.  Right.  His brother's at home, and he's got like a phone from 1975, and his brother's like, guess  where I'm calling from?  Where?  I'm on the street.  And he's like, what?  I've got one of those cell phones.  Like, he's talking like it's fucking 1987. 
[00:46:30]  How hard could it be?  And then he goes, oh, but they were so complicated.  No.  This is the, and it's a phone with, like, giant fucking numbers.  It's got the smallest screen, but, like, you can't do anything on it but call, like, if  you break a hip.  Right.  Or your brother.  It's the break the hip phone.  It's the break the hip phone.  The jitterbug is what I'm about.  I hate to admit it, but my mom, sort of talking to her these days, sort of, since the kid was 
[00:47:00]  born.  Delving.  Sort of talking.  But that relationship sailed away.  Yeah.  But just kind of keeping it peaceful, I guess.  And she wants one of those phones.  A jitterbug?  And she said, in case I fall outside the house.  There you go.  So these old people know, they've got to get the, break the hip phone.  Because they've got that inside thing, I'm falling and I can't get up.  You know, you could get the pendant. 
[00:47:30]  Yeah.  But then, if you're outside the house, you're pretty fucked.  Yeah.  So you've got the jitterbug, which, uh...  The jitterbug.  Jitterbug.  It's, uh...  The jitterbug.  The iPhone killer.  Who sang that?  The jitterbug.  The jitterbug.  The jitterbug.  That was an 80s hit, huh?  It certainly was.  Yeah, the, uh...  In case you go, go.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The jitterbug.  That was wham.  Was it wham?  Yeah.  Sorry, go ahead.  That was it.  No, I'm just saying it's a...  Dr. Ruth needs a fucking, uh, break the hip phone? 
[00:48:00]  She's just some senior citizen.  Yeah, she's so dead right now.  This commercial from 88.  Yeah, she's so dead.  They still play her.  Like, they have new commercials, but they still have this broad on.  I think everybody should have the Life Alert pendant.  The one woman that's in the bathtub, and she falls down, and her daughter finds her in  the tub.  Oh, yeah.  How hard is that?  You don't want to find your mom in the tub.  Oh. 
[00:48:30]  Looks like The Shining.  Every time you go visit mom or dad, talking to the older audience, and they don't answer  the door, you're like, oh, no, what am I going to find inside?  Just start sniffing underneath the door, if you can smell something a little foul, call  the authorities.  Oh, no, I got to go inside.  The commercial always bothers me, because I guess the daughter, like, she throws the  groceries on the floor.  Yeah.  It's like, she's probably been there for hours.  Can't you just take another three seconds and just put the groceries down?  Put the groceries down.  What happened to the groceries?  You just hope that her pet dog isn't gnawing away on her face. 
[00:49:00]  Just chewing.  Oh, God.  That water-soaked, easy-to-bite-through skin.  Then you're relieved that they're just in the bathroom or something.  It's like, oh, okay.  All right.  Here's another day.  They're all right another day.  All right.  All right.  Woo!  Yeah.  See, we talk about real shit on our show.  Oh, it's just the way it is.  Once they get a little older, you start thinking, eh, well.  Where's Sambo?  We got to do some Jocktober. 
[00:49:30]  Sam!  And, by the way, fuck Phil Mushnick and his fuckhole.  This piece of shit.  Phil Mushnick.  He wrote an article on, well, it's titled, Bitter Dregs of a Pop Culture Gone Red Bull.  This piece of shit, Phil Mushnick, who I guess started out as a sports columnist and now he's spreading out to other areas.  Now he thinks anyone wants to know his opinion on everything.  What the fuck is this?  And he's a bad sports reporter because he hates sports at this point.  So move aside and let someone else write about it. 
[00:50:00]  Yeah, let a young buck in there.  But he's writing an article because of what happened to that poor kid in Rutgers who, what, killed himself after he was taped kissing a guy on the internet.  Right.  You know the story.  Yes.  You heard our take on it.  We thought it was horrible what happened to the kid and all that.  But again, I also said, I don't think the people that put the camera in there and shit were trying to expose him or trying to kill him or bullying him. 
[00:50:30]  I think they did a dumb prank that went way the fuck wrong.  I mean, look at fucking American Pie.  Right.  That movie had the same premise.  Right.  Guy's in there.  He's going to have some sex.  The girl comes in and then they're just all watching him on camera.  It's like, oh, that's, you know.  Well, what about Porky's?  Porky's.  Didn't they fucking get the audio going?  Holes in the shower.  Holes in the shower. 
[00:51:00]  But didn't they record?  Wasn't there some kind of recording device?  Did they?  A device to record.  And then.  Sex and blowjobs.  Then the broad from Sex in the City.  Yes.  Her moans were heard throughout the fucking arena or something, right?  Or the high school or something?  Or the gymnasium?  In the gym, but it wasn't recorded.  Oh, wasn't Mike?  She was just being very loud.  You sure it wasn't Mike?  Positive.  She was just being real loud.  What the fuck do I know?  Very loud.  I talked to Ira in the hallway the other day. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  And he goes, I'd like to come back on your show.  I was like, all right, we'll have you back on.  He goes, not on a Friday.  I want to come on on a new day.  Book him for tomorrow.  Fuck it.  Book him.  Get him here tomorrow, man.  Love the Ira.  People love Ira.  Doesn't.  Bitter dregs of a pop culture gone Red Bull.  Only to those who haven't been playing close enough attention could it have come as a shock. 
[00:52:00]  Late last month, 18-year-old Rutgers freshman Tyler Clemente committed suicide, jumped off the George Washington Bridge after two other 18-year-old freshmen.  His roommate and a female accomplice used a webcam to broadcast Clemente in a gay sexual encounter.  Gay.  Gay.  This is just prank shit, unfortunately, that's been going.  Not even unfortunately.  This prank shit's been happening for the beginning of time.  Time.  It's just, I don't know, it's the funniest thing to talk about. 
[00:52:30]  I'm working on it.  Time.  Time.  There are certain words that work so well.  This story led local newscasts and made national network news for days to follow.  Days.  Shocking story.  Except not really, Mr. Fuckface said.  Yeah.  The two young antagonists in this tragedy seem to have only acted upon their training and preconditioning.  Oh, is that it?  And, as have tens of millions of American teens over the last two generations, they were targeted, trained, and conditioned to be remorseless, wise guys. 
[00:53:00]  Wise guys.  Guys.  Really?  Convertly recording one's gay roommate as he is having sex and sharing that video with anyone who would similarly find that as clever or as funny or as high-five, howling fantastic, certainly qualifies in 2010 America as entertainment.  Right up there.  Ready for this, Anthony?  Yes.  Are you ready for this? 
[00:53:30]  Yes.  With the renewal of MTV's Jersey Shore and find me the next Opie and Anthony Drive Time Radio.  That's what our show's about, you cocksucker.  That guy never listens.  Fuck him.  You piece of shit.  We're doing a little more than edgy stuff.  And, actually, our edgy stuff is not really happening much anymore.  You fucking jizz bag.  It's very difficult to do that type of radio anymore.  So, you have to adapt and overcome and come up with other things to do.  This guy's so out of touch, anyway.  We're way more intelligent and way more real than you are, Phil Mushnick, you piece of shit. 
[00:54:00]  Speak for yourself.  Piece of shit.  Phil Mushnick.  And then it goes on and on and on and on.  But, basically, he's blaming people like you and I, Anthony.  And that's why people are recording their gay roommate.  If I could be a rock in a river that deflects the water in a way that, many, many years from now, forms a giant canyon 
[00:54:30]  that might not have been there if my rock was not in that river,  I feel that I've affected society.  Society.  Society.  It's great.  No, and if this guy wants to pin that on me, so be it.  I'm in line with some great people in this world.  Wow, that's your take.  Most of which I won't mention right now because some of them.  But, yeah, fuck it.  If I could actually. 
[00:55:00]  We had a real take on that whole situation.  We talked honestly and openly about it and had a really good discussion about that, Phil Mushnick, you piece of shit.  Exactly.  Why don't you write another column about how you hate sports?  Yeah, go ahead.  A sports column about how you hate sports.  That's wonderful.  That's really taking care of your readers.  Look what I do to Phil Mushnick.  Exactly.  Blowjob gesture.  I'm doing blowjob gesture right now.  Blowjob gesture for Phil Mushnick.  I don't know what you guys are so mad at him for.  He compared you to Jersey Shore.  That's awesome.  Oh, fuck. 
[00:55:30]  Sounds like a great article for me.  And, of course, Sam is in the studio.  Well, I mean, my whole take on that shit is, yeah, we do some crazy stuff on the show, absolutely,  but that's not the only thing we do.  Not anymore.  We have some very good open discussions on everything happening in the world.  Yeah, the show's adapted.  Way more intelligent than anything Phil Mushnick could come up with.  Nick.  Fucking jizz bag.  And, you know something?  Society's just changed in the whole.  It's just changed because of technology, things that are available. 
[00:56:00]  Yeah, kids, they're not being trained to be remorseless assholes that do this.  It's the, I think the same thing was said about TV and radio and shit like that.  It's another form of entertainment that has come out where everybody has the opportunity  to throw a video up on YouTube or wherever else and become the semi-celebrity for the  week or month or whatever the fuck.  Week.  You know what I mean.  18 hours if you're lucky.  I know if you're lucky.  That's what that has come down to. 
[00:56:30]  But it's technology, Phil.  I don't know if Phil understands technology.  No, I don't think so.  I don't think he really understands, because he's talking about a TV show that he probably  heard about and a radio show that you can't do shit like that on radio anyway anymore.  We haven't done anything close to that in many, many years.  He's a few years away from the jitterbug, so we've got to feel a little sorry for him.  I'm Phil Mushnick.  I use the jitterbug.  The jitterbug.  When I call in my stories.  Copyboy.  Copyboy. 
[00:57:00]  There hasn't been a copyboy in years, Phil.  Oh, stop the presses.  Whatever.  He blames.  I hate Phil Mushnick.  He's blaming MTV, Spike Network, True TV, Fuse TV, Fuel TV.  If it has TV in its name, he's blaming it.  Sorry, there's not fucking 13 channels to get up and change from your couch anymore.  There's a lot of shit going on and a lot of time to fill.  So reap, so.  He writes, so reap, so reap.  Now I've got to read more of this. 
[00:57:30]  Things.  Ugly things.  That once just didn't happen.  Ugly things.  Or only rarely happen are now standard.  They happen because they have to happen.  It's a matter of logical conclusion to the illogical stimuli that drives abhorrent behavior.  Brawls among adults at youth league ball games have become commonplace.  No, they fucking haven't, Phil Mushnick.  When one happens, it's reported all over the place, making it look like it's an epidemic.  I got a lot of nephews that play a lot of fucking sports. 
[00:58:00]  I haven't seen one brawl yet, asshole.  Oh, God.  Not one brawl yet, asshole.  Are they happening?  Sure.  It's not commonplace, though.  That's a big leap.  Why?  Because there is no other landing place, Anthony.  Yeah.  That first wave of kids who were raised on trash talking, immodest, me-first behavior as TV, all sports, video game makers, and marketing strategists demanded are parents now. 
[00:58:30]  Yep.  Strategists, sorry.  Their frame of reference is only what it could be.  How could they instill sportsmanship when it's an unknown concept?  Unknown concept.  That's what sports have become, over-the-top sportsmanship, you fucking jizzbag!  That's all it's about.  Everyone wins.  Remember, you douche?  You know about all that.  That's what's commonplace in sports.  Everyone gets a trophy.  Everyone wins.  Everyone is all about sportsmanship. 
[00:59:00]  What are you talking about?  So, this line is fantastic.  Thank God you're going to read, because I'm having a tough time reading it.  Well, first of all, he says, you went through the TV channels already.  Sure.  ABC's America's Funniest Home Videos now attaches laugh tracks to clips of people being thrown headfirst from horses, skis, skateboards, trampolines, dirt bikes, motorcycles, and roofs.  Sure.  Yeah.  Because it's funny.  People enjoy watching other people get hurt.  But, it's just, that's the way it is. 
[00:59:30]  Can we throw a little logic at him that he doesn't understand?  They're not snuff flicks, either.  Let's go Three Stooges, asshole.  Oh.  This has been happening since the dawn of TV.  Hey, Mo, hand me that saw.  Right.  So, why are you trying to make it sound like this is something brand new?  Three Stooges was fucking huge.  Violent as all hell.  Extremely violent.  And guess what?  All that was done for laughs.  Because, in the end, if someone face plants on skis, it's hilarious. 
[01:00:00]  Of course.  And you know it's even hilarious, Phil Mushnick.  Mushnick is retarded.  Listen to this.  This is great.  Best-selling rappers have returned the N-word while chanting greater regard for handguns and designer labels than for young women.  And this tells his age right here, so this tells how out of touch this fuck is.  Red Bull has replaced Yoo-Hoo.  And, yeah. 
[01:00:30]  Yoo-Hoo?  Red Bull has replaced Yoo-Hoo, and Snooki has moved in for Gidget.  Gidget?  Gidget?  Gidget?  Really, Phil?  We're a bit on the older side now, Anthony.  And that's not even our time, Gidget.  We're closer to death than birth, Opie.  I know.  I do the math every night when I fall asleep.  Every night I look at the ceiling and do the math.  Every fucking night.  You don't think I do that math?  Freezing my head. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, my God.  Don't care.  We're in the second half of our lives, and it's the bad second half when everything starts breaking down.  It's right after the click, click, click stops on the roller coaster, and you go to that part.  And we all know how quickly that ride ends.  Oh, wow.  We're doing it.  And you know what?  You can't say, can we do it again?  Nope.  Nope.  One ride per customer.  I'm sure I'm not the only one that does the, I'm closer to blank age than blank age. 
[01:01:30]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, no.  And you can fill in the numbers yourself for your world, because it started when I said,  holy shit.  I remember going, holy shit, I'm closer to 30 than 18.  Yeah.  And man, I wish I had that back.  Was that like two, that was two years ago.  Yeah, two and a half.  Two and a half?  Two and a half years ago.  Yeah, I remember that one.  Now I'm closer to 40 than fucking 25.  Wow.  Yeah.  I like watching those insurance commercials on TV where the guy goes, this is Bob. 
[01:02:00]  He's 45 years old, has two children and a wife.  He'd pay for insurance, and then they go through this whole thing.  And you see this guy, Bob, and you're like, that guy's fucking old.  Like, he's fucking bald.  He's got glasses, gray hair all over.  He's got, like, adult kids running around and shit.  It's like, fuck.  What happened?  Oh, no.  I know.  Unbelievable.  God, Bob, have a drink and fucking invite Danny over. 
[01:02:30]  So he says, how could they instill sportsmanship when it's an unknown concept?  And then he has the Gidget line, like you said, Ant.  Gidget.  Consider the most popular primetime cable TV shows during their formative years.  15 to 20 years ago was the vulgar, homophobic, misogynistic, drug-fueled, crotch-centric, pro-wrestling  garbage, Vince and Linda McMahon and Ted Turner weekly presented.  Best wrestling ever, by the way, was back then. 
[01:03:00]  And I got so entertaining.  Two words for Phil Mushnick.  Oh, suck it.  Suck it.  There you go.  Suck it.  Suck it.  Suck it.  What can I do?  Oh, blowjob move.  Blowjob gesture.  Why don't you talk about that in your column today, you asshole?  Blowjob gesture.  Come on.  I've hated Phil Mushnick for years.  He's a dunce.  He's just not an honest guy.  He doesn't like writing about sports anymore, so he's not going to step aside because he  likes the paycheck he's going to come in. 
[01:03:30]  Lady Gaga has replaced Mae West.  What?  Best-selling rappers, you did that.  What possible good can come from any of this?  Put it all together, and there must be a bigger and bigger price to pay.  It's inevitable.  So reap.  Two Rutgers freshmen set up a third, showing him on a webcam having gay sex.  That's a horrible thing to do to anybody.  We all know that.  And most people listening to our voices and saw the story on the news know it's wrong  and would never do it, you idiot. 
[01:04:00]  No.  It's not an instance where everyone...  I don't like when the media takes one incident and blows it up like it's an epidemic.  Everyone's doing it.  We all got bullied as kids, just about all of us, and most bullies got bullied as well.  Yes.  Bullies.  All of a sudden it's an epidemic.  Why?  Because, unfortunately, a few kids kill themselves?  That sucks.  It's easier to bully now.  Cyber-bullying.  That's what they call it.  Cyber-bullying.  Although, I don't think Phil Mushnick knows what that means. 
[01:04:30]  And I think there's way more tolerance toward gay kids and gay people in general in the year 2010.  Of course there are.  2010.  And Phil Mushnick.  Oh, my God.  Who doesn't love the gay?  Love the gay.  Kids are kissing all over the goddamn place right now.  The gay is fine.  I have my issues with certain people of certain ethnic backgrounds all over.  They're prejudices that have been ingrained in me since childhood.  Sure.  I can't really just ditch them.  And some of them I'm sorry about.  Some of them just prove themselves every day.  But, the gay, I have no problem with the gay. 
[01:05:00]  I know.  And I think a lot of people would be surprised by that.  I don't.  But we are fans of the gay.  They're fucking amazing with the decorating places.  They keep their houses nice.  They fucking work for a living.  We're like the Kathy Griffin of radio shows.  Well, slow down.  I hate her.  Very gay-friendly.  Gay-friendly.  I want to be the Margaret Cho of radio.  Yes, not gay, but very gay-friendly.  Very gay-friendly.  Did you just make a Bonnie ass reference there? 
[01:05:30]  That was hysterical.  No, I didn't.  I was just saying Margaret Cho.  But when Voss said, Bonnie's ass looks like Margaret Cho's face.  That's hilarious.  That is the worst thing you could say about a girl's ass.  By the way, I took his dumb movie home yesterday.  Good.  And I asked him how I was supposed to watch it.  So, I watched it properly.  If you were listening to yesterday, that makes sense.  So, I watched it properly, and God damn, they're onto something.  They're onto something there?  A lot of big stars. 
[01:06:00]  Big stars.  So, you're so reap.  Victim then killed himself.  Yeah, I know.  In other words, two terribly insensitive, no sense of circumstances, 18-year-olds out of three.  He's a horrible writer, too.  He really is.  Let me try that sentence again.  And I know I'm not the greatest reader in the world, but man, this is a fucked-up sentence.  In other words, two terribly insensitive, no sense of circumstances, 18-year-olds out of three. 
[01:06:30]  Wow, that's a question mark.  Question mark.  That is a fucked-up sentence.  So, Reef, two Rutgers freshmen set up a third, showing him on a webcam having gay sex.  The victim then killed himself.  Oh, the victim then killed himself?  In other words, two terribly insensitive, no sense of circumstance, 18-year-olds out of three?  Oh, two terrible out of three. 
[01:07:00]  What?  In 2010, that's about all right.  Okay, okay.  What he's saying is, two of them out of three are scumbags and terribly insensitive.  Two out of three?  Guess that's good in 2010.  Because the third kid was the one that was set up and he killed himself.  So, two out of three are scumbags and two out of three ain't bad, as Meatloaf said.  Yeah.  I want you. 
[01:07:30]  I need you.  This is a poorly written article.  Horribly.  Phil Mushnick stinks.  All right, buddy.  Look what I do to Phil Mushnick.  All right, buddy.  You're on our radar.  We'll have some fun with Phil Mushnick.  Cyber-bully him.  Yeah, I'm going to cyber-bully him.  He just fucking paper-bullied us.  So, suck it.  Whatever.  Boom!  Suck it!  Suck it!  Suck it!  Yeah, suck it!  Should I do? 
[01:08:00]  Should we do a little Jocktober?  Please?  Sounds great.  Can we get the Jocktober intro, please?  Oh, it's very loud.  I've got to pull the headphones off a little bit.  That intro comes on.  Anticipation is killing me.  I know.  I don't know when it's going to come on.  It's very scary.  I love it.  I got tinnitus so fucking bad lately because the other stuff, like the promos and shit,  are so much louder than our voices in the headphones that I swear I'm getting fucking crazy tinnitus. 
[01:08:30]  Yeah.  Where it's like...  That's why, if anybody's noticed, the second I finish a read, I rip the headphones off like I just found out headphones give you brain tumors if you wear them for 30 seconds.  Because it comes on so fucking loud.  And they say it doesn't, you don't hear it on the air.  It's like, yeah, but it's fucking my ears up.  Yeah, I don't know what it is.  Come on, help me out here, Hendry.  I'm going deaf.  Regular radio, they smooth everything, all the levels. 
[01:09:00]  Run it through some kind of capacitor or something.  But with this satellite, you get this crisp audio right in your ears.  And you're hearing, I'm getting tonight.  Ira tomorrow?  Ira.  I believe he's being worked on.  All right, good.  It's October time.  It's October.  Yeah!  This is awesome.  A celebration of fantastic radio from around this great nation of ours.  Great.  Thank you.  So turn up this turntacular radio. 
[01:09:30]  Oh, my God, I can't believe it.  Yeah!  Jocktober.  Yeah!  Sambo, who are we talking about today for this fine Jocktober?  Well, we're heading in a western direction.  Western direction?  Yes.  This is a, now you know Jocktober.  Is this a first for us?  A country Jocktober?  It's certainly not common.  I can't confirm that it's necessarily a first. 
[01:10:00]  But can you deny it?  I couldn't deny it either.  Not confirm or deny.  Right.  So it could be a first.  Yes, yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  Because we're listening to Seattle's Country, 94.1 with Candy and Potter in the morning.  Candy and Potter?  Candy and Potter.  Now, the thing about Candy and Potter is they have a little tagline.  Yeah.  They're married, dot, dot, dot.  On the radio?  To each other.  No, they're not.  They're married.  They're a married couple. 
[01:10:30]  Married.  On the radio.  Ooh.  Are they really?  Oh, yes.  Yeah.  So they never have time away from each other.  Wow!  Which is very important in every marriage.  Maybe they're soulmates.  So they go home together after they work together?  That's right.  To their kid.  Wow, that's fucked up.  To their kid.  All right.  Candy starts her weekend in four words.  That's their bit.  What's your weekend in four words?  What?  Oh, my God.  Like...  What do you mean?  This is going to suck. 
[01:11:00]  No.  Like, if I called a show and said, Sam, what's your weekend in four words?  I'd say special delivery, Sam Dave.  Because that's what I did over the weekend.  I got one for you, Sam.  What's that?  What's the format?  Four words?  Four words.  For the weekend?  Yeah.  I hope you die.  Why?  I'm just playing along.  What does that have to do with your weekend?  No, it's your weekend.  I had one for you.  Need lawyer charges pending.  We're trying to do a friendly morning show here. 
[01:11:30]  We don't want to hear anything like that for the four words.  Sorry.  Those are not the four words.  All right.  Sorry.  Well, see, that's how you play this fun game.  Yeah.  But I'm sure they don't play it in that way.  They've got to keep it safe for everyone, right?  You can keep it friendly.  It's the morning.  I know.  Keep it friendly.  You're going to eat it.  They've got a guy named Steve who does the show with them.  Yes.  Hello, I'm country Steve.  Mick Gay. 
[01:12:00]  He's gay.  All right.  Well, Kenny starts her weekend in four words.  That's her bit, I guess.  She goes for some jokes but gets nothing.  That's right.  That's right.  Another broad on the radio.  There she is.  With her husband.  People are asking me if I like broads on the radio.  There's a few shows I do like out there.  There's a few people that know how to do it right.  Martha Stewart's daughter does great radio with her friend there.  I don't know the name of the show.  I have to give that a listen. 
[01:12:30]  Alexis and what's the other one?  Alexis and...  Ira.  Alexis and Ira.  Jennifer.  Jennifer and Alexis do a pretty good show for a couple women on the radio.  Yes.  See, I could give women compliments that do radio shows.  A couple of broads talking about broads.  When I lived in Boston, Two Chicks Dishing.  When the radio chick was up there, she was good with her partner up there.  With Two Chicks Dishing?  As far as women on the radio go, yeah. 
[01:13:00]  There's a few out there.  And once one of the dishes left, what happened?  Then she came down to New York.  And then what happened?  Not so good?  Not so much?  Delilah's good.  Why, why, why?  Delilah.  Delilah sucks black cock.  Oh, I get it.  We don't know if Delilah sucks the black cock.  We have no idea.  Is she the love song broad?  Thank you.  She's relaxing.  Delilah.  Delilah.  But it's all love songs for people that are going through some tough times. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, and she speaks in a soft voice and tells you to sit back with a nice hot cup of coffee  by the fire.  Yeah.  It's nice.  Wow, that sounds very peaceful and nice.  Soothing.  Great way to end the day.  All right, let's do this.  Candy starts her weekend in four words.  Going for some jokes, but gets nothing.  What was your weekend in four words?  You can text in, because that's easy with...  Oh, what was your weekend?  I thought...  Oh.  Yeah.  Oh.  That's not how you heard it, right, Ant?  She should tell her husband there, I fucked your friend.  Oh.  That would be good.  Now that would get a laugh. 
[01:14:00]  It would get a laugh.  I would laugh.  Yeah, come on.  What was your weekend in four words?  You can text in, because that's easy with four words, obviously.  5-4-9-9-9-4, or you can always call us, 800-464-94FM.  Most interesting in four words.  We'll get you some prizes this morning.  Candy, what was your weekend in four words?  Please let me leave.  Please.  This is...  I spent a lot of time out of the house this weekend.  This October writes itself.  What happened?  Wow.  And for the people out there, we tell Sam, please don't do like a greatest hits of awfulness. 
[01:14:30]  Just get one stupid show and get some highlights.  It's yesterday's show, right?  Like, this stuff writes itself.  I gave you AIDS, baby.  That was what...  Please let me leave.  So?  What is the...  Did you repeat it?  Please.  This is...  I spent a lot of time out of the house this weekend, because Potter wasn't feeling well,  and the rule was he wasn't going to be around the baby.  Right.  Don't touch the baby, don't look at the baby.  Please don't lick the baby. 
[01:15:00]  Don't look at the baby?  I didn't get that rule.  Don't lick the baby anymore.  Please don't.  I got the, can you entertain him from 10 feet away for a few minutes so that I can take  a shower?  Yeah, it was pretty interesting watching you do that.  But yeah, good show.  Kid's name's Potter?  Potter's the husband.  Oh.  Oh, right.  What happened there?  I don't know.  We gotta get rid...  I don't know what happened.  We gotta get rid of Jack Tolbert.  It's just...  It's frustrating.  It's starting to sink in, right?  I don't really understand what they just did.  It's all fun in the beginning, and then you guys just start getting very frustrated. 
[01:15:30]  You know what else happens with these married couples on the air that I'm seeing?  They can't see that they don't know it's an inside thing.  Right.  Like, if I say something to Opie about my weekend, right?  Right.  And you don't really, like, totally get what I just said, you'll be like, wait, what?  Yeah.  And then I'll have to explain it a little better, because maybe I didn't add enough detail  or whatever.  They're married, and they were doing this together, so they could talk to each other like, oh, 
[01:16:00]  we know what we're talking about, but the listener's sitting there going, who the...  What the fuck are they talking about?  And Steve is not doing a good job of bringing everybody in.  He sucks.  I guess, what, the kid...  The kid's sick?  No.  Who's sick?  Who's sick?  You got that completely wrong.  The husband...  Potter?  ...was sick, so Potter...  Wasn't allowed to touch the baby because he's sick?  Wasn't allowed to touch or look or lick the baby.  Yeah, don't lick the baby.  That was the joke.  It was a little risque right there.  Where's the joke?  Oh, Uncle Paul, if he was here.  By the way, James in Seattle, on Candy and Potter's website, they have this hilarious marriage 
[01:16:30]  scorecard...  Don't, don't...  ...that their producer does.  Oh.  It's hilarious.  I mean, that's...  It gets brought up?  It gets brought up.  Oh, okay.  Let's just say something similar.  Ah.  Candy tells a story that is both mundane and asinine, Anthony.  Did she mean it to be?  I don't think so.  It's the Candy and Potter show out of...  Oh, is that them?  Yeah.  Let me see.  This is one of those stories that, like...  Candy looks like she likes to eat a lot of.  I guess Candy's expecting her second child. 
[01:17:00]  I mean, I don't think she's pregnant.  No, I don't think that's the case.  Oh, well.  Yeah.  She kind of looks that...  Damn.  She might be with a child.  What is...  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh.  Yeah, she's a little puffy.  Oh, boy.  A little puffy around the...  Yeah.  Have you ever had your wife come home and tell a story about something that happened during  the day and you go, like, you just sit there, like, why are you telling me this? 
[01:17:30]  Like, imagine if she was on the radio with you.  Wow.  And that was the whole thing.  She's just telling you these...  Yeah.  Like, stories.  All right.  This isn't interesting.  Well, you're saying the story is both mundane and asinine.  That's good news.  That sounds good.  Right.  I mean, those are big words, so I think those are both positive things.  I'm not sure.  Mundane and asinine.  But, yeah, so I was out of the house a lot and I went to Babies R Us and I was in there.  It was Toys R Us and I was in there with him and...  By the way, Anne, I've been to Babies R Us and Bye Bye Baby probably... 
[01:18:00]  I've gone in there to get, like, gifts for people.  Probably a dozen times in the last five months.  Do you hear me talking about it?  Why would I talk about it?  No.  So, in case something funny happens with some of the people that are around...  Nothing funny happens at those stores.  Maybe not the ones you do.  You don't think anything funny is happening in Babies R Us?  What are you setting up for over there?  It's just a cavalcade.  But, yeah, so I was out of the house a lot and I went to Babies R Us and I was in there. 
[01:18:30]  It was Toys R Us and I was in there with him and I listened to a guy and a girl and they  were obviously purchasing something off of a baby registry and the girl's argument was,  I really don't want to get something just off the registry.  It seems impersonal.  Get something off the registry.  And the guy's argument was, yeah, but just tell me whatever I have to do to get out of  this store.  I don't care.  It's on the registry because they need it.  Well, yeah, but we should really...  No, what do you want me to do?  What do you want to buy? 
[01:19:00]  Do you want to buy this?  And you just started picking stuff off shelves.  Do you want to buy this?  Do you want to buy this?  Whatever I got to do to get out of this store, I'm going to do it.  And they just started cracking up laughing about the whole thing.  The guy was not happy about being in that store.  The guy was there.  It was birth control for him.  It totally was.  That's what you hear when you're trying to watch anything you want to watch.  Sports, something interesting on Discovery Channel, whatever it is.  That is what you hear, and you just want to fucking punch her in the face. 
[01:19:30]  Like you have to put the DVR on pause, and then you take a deep breath and look, what?  Deep breath, turn around.  What?  Let me pause.  Hold on.  You go like, hold on, hold on.  Click.  Turn around and go, yeah?  Yeah.  Lay it on me.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  Get this over with.  Really?  And then right when she finishes, you go, click, hit play again.  And that should speak volumes.  And then she starts talking again, pause again, look again until she realizes no concept that 
[01:20:00]  you have no desire to hear a story at that moment.  We're looking at a picture of Candy, and she looks like she lives in the woods.  Wow.  What is going on with her there?  Does she live in the woods, Sam?  I don't think so.  No.  Seattle, Washington.  All right.  Well, what's great also in that clip is that, like...  That would mean that there's something great in that clip.  Well, I thought it was great.  It was one of my favorite things in Jocktober that we haven't even really talked about.  She was trying to set up...  How does gravity work, Anthony?  Uh-oh.  Well... 
[01:20:30]  Because she's a big girl.  Do you fall to Earth faster?  How does that really work?  As a matter of fact, no.  It doesn't matter.  I've heard that.  It's a constant.  And a vacuum tube.  Yeah, it's a constant.  This isn't a vacuum tube, though.  So doesn't she fall to Earth faster?  No, no.  She wouldn't fall faster.  Oh, yeah.  It's the famous experiment.  I know.  It's a feather in the rock.  From the Leaning Tower of Pisa.  Yeah.  By Galileo.  Yeah.  I love that she's trying to start a call-in topic of, you know, do you buy off the registry 
[01:21:00]  or do you buy off the shelf?  Great topic, by the way.  Except she set it up so poorly and it's such an awful topic that they have to move on.  There's not one caller about it.  They just...  Like, that's the end of the topic.  They just ditch it.  Right.  And that happens all the time.  That's my favorite.  When you listen to the next break and they're talking about something different because they've  given up on that one.  Her profile's really weird.  Yeah, she...  I can't figure it out.  She looks like a fat guy.  She looks like, um... 
[01:21:30]  She looks like someone, doesn't she?  Don't say E-Rock.  I can't quite place...  Who's it?  She looks like a...  By saying, don't say E-Rock?  Yeah.  You just said E-Rock.  Oh, shucks.  Oh, darn.  I saw what you did there.  E-Rock with long hair?  Darn it.  I think she looks like one of the SpongeBob SquarePants characters.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, okay.  The one that died with the boys.  Patrick.  Is it Patrick?  The starfish?  Look at you guys.  All right.  Hey, Potter talks about his weekend in four words.  Oh, boy. 
[01:22:00]  This has got to be good.  Some of that husband-wife banted...  Banter.  Oh, it says banted.  I know.  Banter starts to pop up.  So you get to see the chemistry of the married couple on the radio.  What they're like at home.  My weekend in four words was built immunity to NyQuil.  I came down with something Friday night and spent most of the weekend in bed not touching  the baby, as Candy had said.  Don't touch the baby.  And I fell off of her candy because she put up with...  You know, she had to watch the baby all weekend.  I didn't get any sympathy because of that, but, you know, that's another story. 
[01:22:30]  Really?  Tell her.  Well, that's one of the cool things about being in a relationship before you have kids  is you get sympathy.  When you're sick.  Yes.  You get sympathy.  Right.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  So what would you rather me do?  Keep the five-month-old alive or give you sympathy?  But if the situation were reversed, you would have taken care of Beck.  So, I mean, it's not...  Exactly.  Beck.  Exactly.  Beck.  Yes, Beck.  The kid's name's Beck.  Doesn't she sound like a pleasure to have around the home?  She sounds like a joy.  Yeah.  Like just a joy. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  I get to go to work.  Let's go together.  Now we're going home together.  Wow.  She's got a germ issue, huh?  She doesn't...  Yeah.  When someone's sick in the house, it doesn't matter.  The kid's going to get sick whether you're touching it or not.  Doesn't she realize that?  She's a germ freak.  What are you...  I can't...  That's funny.  I can't even deal.  All right.  Well, this is going to be a quick jocktober because this is just...  You just fed up with them already.  You just don't want anything to do with them.  It's like eating mashed potatoes. 
[01:23:30]  I mean, you know.  She is really just...  This really shows how dull.  This is a very, just very bland show.  Yes.  Yeah.  There's no real...  Nothing going on here.  Very bland.  But they're married.  A caller calls up for the weekend in four words.  Oh.  Think Candy is a hole.  I'm like, is that a question?  Do you think she is? 
[01:24:00]  Oh.  We'll find out with this call.  Think Candy's a hole?  I'll answer your questions.  All right.  Here we go.  The man Perry on the new 94.1 KMPS.  Weekend in four words.  What'd you do over the weekend?  We got a text from the 206.  Jack asked me out.  Yay.  Finally.  It took forever.  Husband's ex-wife's wedding.  I'd love to know more about that story.  And drank tons of beer.  Well, let's see.  Dina is on the phone.  Dina, what was your weekend in four words?  Toes, lunch, shopping, fun. 
[01:24:30]  I hope at the end of this story, your toes are still attached.  My toes are...  What does that mean, you stupid broad?  I'm getting mad again.  I keep forgetting how angry I get.  What does that mean?  These are your radio peers.  Fuck you, Sam.  You guys are in the same business.  You're both hosts of a morning show.  Danny's playing four words for the husband.  I love it.  Fucked some fat pig.  Oh, I hope he didn't mean his wife. 
[01:25:00]  Contemplated killing my family.  Oh.  Nice.  All right.  Toes, lunch, shopping, fun.  I hope at the end of this story, your toes are still attached.  My toes are purple with spider webs and spiders.  Oh, happy Halloween.  Halloween pedicure.  That's funny.  Yes, it was.  That's nice.  I got a pedicure this weekend, too.  And when I came home to show Potter, he was like, it looks like something got dropped on your toe. 
[01:25:30]  That wasn't very nice.  They are a severe Navy.  It's a severe Navy.  I'm getting really mad.  They're talking about pedicures.  The guy in there is not sticking up for fucking men.  I'm angry.  There's two guys in the room.  And they're just shutting up and allowing them to talk about dumb pedicures.  Candy's got to get her time in, too.  And if you're getting, like, spider webs on your toes and all that shit, you're a fat broad.  Fuck.  Just a distraction from everything else. 
[01:26:00]  What's bothering you about this, Anthony?  It's just infuriating listening to, like, talk that you could listen to at, like, a fucking, like, a shower.  Like, at a baby shower.  Like, you'd get annoyed if somebody was in the elevator having this conversation.  Oh, yes!  And that's only for four people, not on a radio show.  This is horrible.  Horrible.  Jess got her nails done.  We could talk about that.  That's okay.  Well, she's at least, you know, she's cute. 
[01:26:30]  Well, yeah.  Not like fucking candy.  No, she isn't.  That wasn't very nice.  They are a severe Navy.  It's a severe Navy color.  It's very dark.  They're black.  She's gone goth.  They're not black.  Well, you know, it's Halloween time.  Yeah.  They're black.  It's fun.  They're just really, really, really dark blue.  Girls ganging up on the guy.  Yeah, watch out.  Look out.  Girls win.  Girls win.  Girl power.  She can have whatever color she wants.  Yeah, she wants black, apparently. 
[01:27:00]  Really, really dark blue.  Oh.  Huh?  I thought maybe that was a four-word weekend, something about black.  Black.  Where else are we going?  I don't know.  Potter, maybe, was away.  He was in his sick bed.  He was sick.  Downstairs.  Candy's four-word weekend.  Black cock in ass.  Okay.  Potter is a cuckold.  I prepped the bull. 
[01:27:30]  Candy again.  I suspect he's gay.  Gay.  Gay.  Not Potter.  Someone wrote, gay sex at Park.  Jimmy South, Vermont.  But this is how you play the game if you're going to play a horseshit radio game.  You have fun with it.  You don't actually play legitimately.  No.  Like some factual information.  Right.  Well, we move on with Candy and Potter out of Seattle. 
[01:28:00]  It's Jacktober, everybody.  A tease for their big upcoming bit.  What's that?  Oh.  Well, I wanted you guys to hear the tease before you knew what was coming next, the same way  a radio audience would.  All right.  Let's do that.  This is the tease.  Lee Bryce, Love Like Crazy on the new 94.1.  KMPS showers becoming partly sunny and then a high of 60.  It's Candy and Potter.  Our marriage report card is on the way here in just a second.  It's the one time a week we give each other a letter grade for how we were as a spouse.  And I'll tell you right now, Candy's going to get an A-plus today. 
[01:28:30]  But if she acted exactly the same way a year ago, she would have gotten an F.  What?  Think about why that would be.  We'll get into the marriage report card next.  KMPS.  Wow.  We have to think about it.  That's a great tease.  Let me think about it.  Um, she sucked your cock, but she didn't used to.  No.  That's an F and then an A-plus.  What about she learned not to use teeth when she sucked your cock? 
[01:29:00]  She gave up the ass.  Finally.  Could that be it?  Wait.  She gave up, I'll see, five words.  That would have been a perfect four-word weekend.  She gave up ass.  Could be gave up the ass.  Could it turn it into shitter?  Gave up the shitter.  Gave up the shitter.  Gave up the shitter.  That's right.  That would work.  That's perfect for Potter.  She had the baby.  Yeah.  The vag got a little stretchy.  Yeah.  So she went right for the fucking, he went for the ass.  She finally said yes. 
[01:29:30]  A-plus.  You think that's what?  Years ago.  Oh, yeah.  F.  That's what we're going with, Sam.  Are we correct?  No.  The candy give up the shitter?  You have to put it in context of a friendly morning show.  That's not the type of thing.  The candy open up the place where the poo comes out?  No, I mean, that's a little vulgar.  Did he put his pee-pee where her duty is?  In her cocky hole?  And Danny got another one.  Busted inside again.  Fuck.  These are, like, it's not something you want to hear in the morning first thing. 
[01:30:00]  I think it's going to be great.  That radio.  Oh, another one coming in for Potter.  I fucked the babysitter.  Thank you.  That was an opiate ritual.  Cheers.  If you just said that on the air and candy went, what?  What?  What?  What?  It's true.  It's true.  He just had a mental breakdown.  He just starts talking.  Yeah.  Fuck all the babysitters.  Everyone we've ever had.  Cursing on the air and reviewing all his skeletons in his closet.  Did Potter really say, four-word weekend, I'm a kid-toucher? 
[01:30:30]  That's how you play the game, though.  See, this is why we do Jocktober, Sam.  This is exactly why.  Because now we take their bit, we show them how it's done properly, and then maybe they  will learn from us and jazz up the bit a little bit.  Pump it up a little bit.  Andy, saying, the baby's half-p***er.  Now that could be a problem. 
[01:31:00]  Or if they want to play it safe, because it is country.  The kid, not yours.  Ah, yes.  That would be safe.  And then that would be a discussion.  And you guys would do the marriage report card differently, too?  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be great.  Well, Anthony, are you ready for...  Depending on young girls.  Are you ready for the marriage report card?  Am I?  It's time for Candy and Potter's Marriage Report Card. 
[01:31:30]  One time a week, Candy and I give each other a letter grade on how we've been as a spouse  and a parent over the last week.  I was going to tell you, when we were out at the Poodle Dog and Fight for our Hole in the  Wall tour, this guy who's been married 25 years goes, I don't know why you guys do  that.  What?  I said, do what?  And he's like, give each other grades.  You're just asking for it.  It's communication.  He said I was asking for it.  Communication.  Well, there's a whole nother world that we have no concept about.  Absolutely.  This is why I don't have a lot of friends as an older gentleman. 
[01:32:00]  A gentleman.  Because this shit is really all around us, right?  Yes.  Friendly people?  Just mundane horseshit.  Not friendly people.  Just mundane horseshit.  Just time-wasting.  Right.  Wasting time.  Garbage.  Why are you telling me this?  Who is driving, listening to this, just going like, yeah, yeah.  Oh, by the way, did you hear Candy and Potter today?  God damn, they did this, the marriage report call. 
[01:32:30]  I was laughing.  I was laughing.  I don't know.  No.  Do you think people die in car accidents because they fall asleep at the wheel while Candy and  Potter are on?  Yeah, just dozing off as Candy's rambling.  Just killing kids.  Sam, would you allow me to say Negroes in front of you?  I would appreciate it if you didn't, but it's your show.  Max wants to play the four-word weekend, and this one would be for Candy, I would assume.  Ass raped by Negroes.  Oh, that's...  Oh, man. 
[01:33:00]  Damn.  Is that something you can take back?  You don't want to have Candy say that if you're a Potter.  No.  There's nothing wrong with Negroes.  Well, I like getting blue jams.  Oh, Jen.  Tom in Connecticut, he has a four-word weekend.  Oh, yes, Tom.  Yeah, definitely Potter saying glory hole truck stop.  That should be a country band.  Yes.  Glory hole truck stop.  Ladies and gentlemen. 
[01:33:30]  Potter was sick and bad.  He wasn't at any glory hole.  He was.  He was.  That's why she gets an A+, I know, because...  All right, well, let's get into the marriage report card.  It's communication.  He said I was asking for it.  Communication.  Well, I will tell you, Candy is getting an A+, this week.  But if she'd acted exactly the same way a year ago, she would have gotten an F.  And that is because one of the few perks that I like in a relationship, like Candy and I have been together for 12 years now. 
[01:34:00]  Yeah.  Something like that.  The only things that I asked for in a relationship was, when I get sick, I want sympathy.  I want somebody to take care of me.  Yes.  Spoil me, Rod.  That's it.  Oh, my God.  That's all he talks about all day long.  The sympathy thing again.  Sympathy again.  This was an hour later.  How about a fever fuck?  Nothing better than when you're sick and a girl gives you the fever fuck.  Oh, my God.  And you got a fever ball bag.  You got that ball bag that's like Turkish taffy.  Just all fever-y.  It's like fever-y.  You got fever cock. 
[01:34:30]  It's plump but hot.  Right.  A girl should jump on fever dick.  A girl should jump on the red side from having a fever.  It's because you got a fever.  You're also like, you're hot and everything you touch.  The inside of your thighs are hot.  Your bag is down.  You could actually sit on your own ball bag if you're not careful.  It's just trying to get fucking, like, some cool air to keep it at temperature.  Fever fuck is great.  And girls like fever fuck because your cock is, like, hot.  Is that a punk band? 
[01:35:00]  Fever fuck?  Yeah.  Yeah, I just saw them the other night.  And are they playing with Truck Stop Glory Hole?  Yes.  Nice.  Double bill.  That's a good double bill right there.  Michelle in Buffalo.  Wow, man.  It's got the feedback rocking.  Everybody loves the four-word weekend.  Four-word weekend.  Surprise, you have AIDS.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, that's not nice.  Now, come on, guys.  Bad news.  And Eric in Utah, jerked off, contemplated suicide. 
[01:35:30]  Oh, I hope not.  That's a fun weekend.  This guy writes, busted with a tranny.  Oh, Jay Norton.  I want somebody to take care of me.  Yes, spoil me rotten.  That's it.  And a year ago, if she'd ignore me all weekend while I was sick,  I would have been pretty angry and she would have got a nap.  But now that we have a newborn, that all changes.  I wasn't going to be around.  Wow, that was worth sticking through 12 minutes of commercials. 
[01:36:00]  Holy shit.  And let's not forget to start with the T's, the radio T's.  And the country hits, too.  It's not just commercials.  Do you think someone's driving as he's talking out loud?  They're going like, yeah, uh-huh.  Yeah.  I know.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I can relate to this show.  Yeah, Potter.  Yep, yep.  Oh, gosh, yes.  It's every man's show.  Yeah, I can.  Yeah, I can.  Kevin in Connecticut.  Kevin in Connecticut.  Fuck your mom anally. 
[01:36:30]  Oh.  I hope not.  Oh.  And Frank in New York.  I'll be honest.  I don't like this type of humor, but it kind of works today.  Yeah.  Who am I to say that this shouldn't be on our show?  Go ahead, Frank.  Hey, it's Left Baby in Dumpster.  Oh.  I don't see.  Well, it was probably playing.  Yeah.  Some fun toys.  I hope it's out now.  It's the dumpster behind Toys R Us.  Oh, good.  Yeah.  Got an F.  But now that we have a newborn, that all changes.  I wasn't going to be around the baby too close, so she took care of the baby all weekend. 
[01:37:00]  So for that, you get an A+.  Now, wait a minute.  Oh, yeah.  Of course there's a wait a minute.  Of course there is.  She doesn't like that.  Of course.  Kick to the uterus in Michigan.  His four-word weekend for Potter.  Sure.  I really enjoy docking.  Oh.  Yeah, it's not nice.  And Joe writes, throat fuck this hole.  Jesus.  The fucking A-plus isn't right.  No.  Like, if you want to even think on these people's mindset here, an A, maybe. 
[01:37:30]  A-plus is the best grade ever, which means he got sympathy for being sick and got, like,  just fucking blowjobs and shit.  Like, she allowed her hot friends to come over and he could fuck them.  Yeah.  Like, that's an A-plus.  That's the plus part.  That's the plus part.  That's the bonus.  You can't add a plus to it when all she did was, like, oh, what, get him aspirin?  Yeah.  Because she didn't even take care of him.  She just looked after the baby.  She did her wifely duties. 
[01:38:00]  Wifely duties.  That's a C-plus at best.  Exactly.  At best.  There's way too many coming in.  There is a couple of really funny ones.  Fuck.  Hold on a minute.  Gotta move.  Megan's Law came in from Jordan.  Oh, shit.  He's a pedophile.  Of course he is.  I had no idea.  Oh, shit.  There was a really good one. 
[01:38:30]  Motorboat.  Yes.  Ah, fuck it.  Too many coming in.  All right, back to this.  AB too close, so she took care of the baby all weekend.  So for that, you get an A-plus.  Now, wait a minute.  Who brought you Tom Young-gong?  Who brought you soup on Saturday night?  Yeah, you picked it up while you were picking it up for yourself.  What?  It's not like she still took care of you.  She did to an extent, but I spent a lot of the weekend in pain in bed by myself. 
[01:39:00]  But I told you, you were great.  You were with our newborn, which was way more important.  I see.  Stop eating you, cow.  That's the one I was looking for.  Oh, don't.  That's a little mean.  That was the one I was looking for.  Stop eating you, cow.  She's getting sassy.  Newborn, which was way more important.  I see.  So I keep the baby alive, and I still get an A-plus.  It's like those guys who take steroids but then get into the Baseball Hall of Fame.  That's what you just did to me.  Let me point out.  You just starred my entry.  Let me just point out.  It's kind of like a little baby kid, kind of, a little bit. 
[01:39:30]  You're complaining about an A-plus.  It's an A-plus under conditions.  No.  No, it wasn't under conditions.  I'm saying...  See, it's never good enough.  Not for Candy.  Never good enough.  Candy's arguing about an A-plus.  Yeah.  I figure.  Of course she is.  Oh, God.  Conditions.  No.  No, it wasn't under conditions.  I'm saying...  Next to it.  ...compared to if we didn't have a kid.  You were fantastic all weekend.  You did more than I could have ever expected. 
[01:40:00]  There's no asterisk here.  Except your A-plus.  Anyway.  Anyway.  I wonder who wears the pants in that house.  The phones are just lit, Ant.  Do you mind if we play a little forward?  Let us, please.  Corinne from...  Where's it?  Corinne.  I don't know.  From Colorado.  It's Corinne.  Okay.  So, Potter enjoyed a lemon party.  Oh, no.  Enjoyed a lemon party.  I love it.  Drinking nothing but broth just came in. 
[01:40:30]  David from the Poconos.  Nice.  All right.  Beer, football, jerk-off, nap.  Yeah, let's say hi to Jerry in Jersey.  Jerry?  Jerry?  Jerry?  Yeah.  She's giving herself...  He's giving her an A-plus, but she's just saying beforehand that she...  She's got her nails done.  So, how would she take care of the baby?  Yeah, really? 
[01:41:00]  That sounds like just an A, not an A-plus.  Who's taking care of the baby?  Maybe an A-minus.  What about the baby?  That's a good one.  Potter says, Chris Benoit, my hero.  But he killed his wife and kid.  I know.  Anthony, Paul in Jersey has one.  Paul?  Hey, what's up?  This one's from Candy, 65 guy, cream pie.  Cream pie.  That's so many guys.  That is.  So many guys just coming inside of her. 
[01:41:30]  Yeah.  Cream pie.  And they're not her husband.  Yeah.  These are unkind things to say.  I didn't think we were going to go this route with Candy and Potter.  You didn't foresee this coming, huh?  Anthony, very good news.  Candy gets back at Potter with her report card.  All right.  She needs a grade for him.  Hilarity ensues.  Hilarity.  I'm going to give you a sympathy, A. 
[01:42:00]  Because I didn't give you very much sympathy, but I still took care of you over the weekend  while you were sick.  And because that is the right thing to do to make you feel better about yourself.  So I will give you an A.  And you know what?  I'm giving you an A also because you went and got a flu shot, even though you didn't  want to.  And that's what being a good parent is all about.  Doing things that you don't want to do for the benefit of your child.  So that's why you're sick.  I should get an A.  And that is why I'm sick.  You can't get sick from the flu shot.  I never get sick.  Never get flu shots.  I get a flu shot five days later.  I'm sick.  I'm just saying. 
[01:42:30]  It's just the time of year.  Purely coincidental.  I'm sure it is.  I'm on board with the conspiracy theorist that the flu shot gets you sick.  No, it doesn't.  Because that's what happened to me.  It's a dead virus.  You didn't get injected with a live virus.  Tim McGraw is on the new 94.1.  KMPS.  I like his thinking.  It's a conspiracy between him and his wife to bore people to death.  I'll be investigating.  Shut it.  How many more days is October? 
[01:43:00]  We're only halfway through.  Not even.  Not even.  The 12th of 31 days.  Isn't there like five weeks in this month or something, too?  Or five Fridays or five...  I don't know.  Someone was trying to tell me that.  31 days.  Yeah, but in some weird way, there's five of everything this month except for the Mondays and  Thursdays.  All right.  Everything in between.  It's like five weekends or something this month, and that doesn't happen.  I don't know.  30 days, half September, April, June, and November.  This was some shit chat I was listening in on.  Nah, it's five Fridays, five Saturdays, five Sundays. 
[01:43:30]  And that doesn't happen usually or something?  I don't know.  What a special jocktober this is.  What are you going to spend your weekends doing in four words?  We already did the bit, Sam.  We were terrific at it, too.  But they say, what did you do?  What are we going to do?  See, that's a whole new twist.  And now we can do a whole new twist on it.  What are you going to do?  Especially since there's an extra weekend this month. 
[01:44:00]  There's the tie-in to something topical and relatable.  Oh.  I'll have Sam fired.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  Oh, damn.  Yeah.  That stinks.  All right.  Are we done with this?  Yeah, I guess so.  Unless you want to listen to the clips again.  No.  All right.  Check states' consent laws.  That's important to be aware.  Sometimes.  All right. 
[01:44:30]  All right.  You guys are in a bad mood, I think.  Yeah.  It just angered me.  Yeah.  I hate her.  Yeah, we're in a bad mood.  They're just frustrated now.  I'm sorry.  And you said there are peers.  They are your peers.  Your fellow radio DJ hosts.  Our fellow broadcasters.  Pat from Monaki says, Sam has f*** hair.  Oh, don't say that, Pat.  Don't use that word.  Oh, Pat now.  Don't use that word.  Oh, Pat.  What are you saying now, Pat? 
[01:45:00]  No reason to stereotype.  Oh.  Yeah.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Patrice O'Neill is here.  Yes.  The great Patrice O'Neill.  He would have liked Jack Tober.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter is here in the house.  To nod it off again.  No, he would have had to walk around the room and got into diabetic shock.  Patrice who what?  Remember that?  He can't handle Jack Tober.  Who?  Who are you talking about, what?  Patrice?  Well, he got here about a half hour ago, and I said, just bring him in, but I don't think 
[01:45:30]  he's a big fan of Jack Tober.  No, he's like, fuck it.  I'll wait until they're done with that horse shit.  There are a lot of bad radio shows.  Yeah, I know.  All right.  Why don't we take a break so we can get Patrice right in here.  Patrice O'Neill next.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the virus.  It's excellent.  One who doesn't care is one who shouldn't be.  I'm trying to hide myself from what is wrong for me. 
[01:46:00]  For me.  We got Patrice O'Neill in studio.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  He's a good one to follow on Twitter.  And PatriceO'Neill.com, my friend.  Oh, you got that up and running again.  Finally got that up and running.  Nice.  That's what you need.  Your own name, for fuck's sake.  Yeah, I guess.  Yeah. 
[01:46:30]  Patrice, I actually got something for you today.  You better have that bottle of Louie the 13th, man.  Aw, shit.  Wow.  That's huge.  Motherfucker.  Yeah, nigga.  Louie Trey.  Let me tell you something.  That's my friend, Opie Greg Hughes, motherfucker.  Let me tell you something about this.  I've had this for, I don't know, 11, 12 years.  I have not.  I don't know what I wanted to do with this for so long.  Ant's got one of these, too. 
[01:47:00]  Hey, I got one in my bar, it's just sitting up there on the shelf, all nice with a light  behind it.  It's fucking fantastic.  It sparkles.  It's like magical.  And what is this?  Like, it's cognac, right?  Yeah.  It's Louie the 13th cognac.  Look at that.  With a little, little, little, when you do open it up with a little fucking crystal top.  Wow, Svorsky's crystal top.  It comes in a fucking nice box.  What's your top, dude?  Look at the presentation.  Look at the presentation.  What's the crystal?  Don't let the crystal fall.  It's got a little book.  Oh, it has a fucking thousand thread count sheet in there. 
[01:47:30]  Oh, yeah, it does.  A thousand thread count.  It comes with a little booklet.  That explains Louie the 13th.  Oh, I'm fucking very happy, man.  This is very nice of you.  And it's never been opened.  I so wish I was still that same person.  Dude, I just thought about that.  I so wish.  I don't smell it, but I did think about it.  I was thinking it.  That's a hard smash, though, right, dude.  That's a goddamn sledgehammer. 
[01:48:00]  We talked about this last time you were here, and I didn't forget.  And I'll be serious for a moment.  I mean, everything you've done for our fucking radio show is the least I could do.  That's fucking beautiful.  And I've been trying to figure out what to do with this bottle for the longest time.  And I hand this over to you, Patrice.  That, this is.  All I ask is you invite me over so I can have a shot.  Because I don't even know if I would enjoy it.  What are you doing this Thanksgiving?  I'll be around.  I mean, I'm doing my family thing.  But if you've got something like outside that Thursday, I'll do something. 
[01:48:30]  When's the next holiday that can have something happening?  You can't.  What?  You just have strangers over?  Not strangers, but friends over for Thanksgiving?  Is that kind of a family thing?  No, I have friends.  And because of comics, I have comics that don't have family to go to.  Lonely comics.  Oh, so you.  Maybe we could stop by later in the day or something.  Here, hand that over to Patrice.  I open my doors to the unfortunate.  The box is a little fucked up because it's moved a few times.  That's fine, man.  But the box inside is not fucked up.  That's fine.  This is fantastic.  That is a.  This is.  Some of this is going to be poured on top of bitches' heads. 
[01:49:00]  This is threesome.  This is a threesome drink.  Threesome drink right there.  She's listening, bitch.  Ron, this is threesomes happening here.  That's why it's called Louis Trey.  Oh.  Yeah.  And you know what you do?  I mean, that thing isn't opened yet.  But when you do open it, then you could fill it up with some cheap shit and no one will ever know.  I need a Marshall's bag because.  Yeah, right?  I get robbed from here.  You're going to so get robbed if you just carry that around with you.  Yeah, supposedly the empty crystal bottle goes for five, six hundred dollars. 
[01:49:30]  Oh, that's crazy.  Supposedly.  And if you look it up, I mean, it used to go for well over a thousand, that bottle.  That's good shit.  Well over a thousand.  Thank you, man.  Least I could do.  Very nice of you.  Thank you.  Of course I have to do it on the air to look like a good guy.  I could have done it off air secretly, but I had to make a big fucking presentation out of it.  But you just, you know.  And it gives a couple of motherfuckers something to do.  Yeah.  You know, some people are happy.  Some people are saying you fucking bonding thing there, right there.  Nigger. 
[01:50:00]  Give me that nigga Louis XIII.  He doesn't even know what it is.  What is Louis XIII going for these days?  Full or empty?  Well, what do you mean empty?  Well, the full bottles, it looks like they're going for about fifteen hundred.  Fifteen hundred.  It's about the going rate?  Yeah, that's what you got right there.  Are you sure this?  I think it goes for more.  Check the one with the thousand three count sheet.  I might have a, it might be a.  I think it goes for more.  I, uh, liquor store people have offered me a thousand for it on the spot when I talked  about it.  Said, look, you bring it in, you know, today I will give you a thousand dollars cash. 
[01:50:30]  So they know they can make money reselling it.  That's the one right there, right?  Yeah, that's the one.  Yeah.  So what is that going for?  That one's going for, you could buy it now for seventeen fifty.  Seventeen fifty.  Say?  And what does the empty bottle go for?  It's ranging.  Is it five hundred like people have told me over the years or is it less?  It doesn't seem to be that much, but it's, it is, it does seem to be ranging anywhere  from like a hundred to two hundred.  Oh, okay.  I heard.  I heard ten ninety nine right there.  Or ten ninety nine right there. 
[01:51:00]  Plus it's starting pit, so.  Oh, I still got five days.  But Patrice.  That's a nice thing you did, man.  I appreciate that.  But you gotta, you pour some cheap shit right back in that bottle, no one's gonna know  the difference.  I'm telling you, you got a Louis XIII for the rest of your life.  Oh, so that's not.  Think about it.  I like that.  Because no one knows what cognac's supposed to taste like.  Someone would.  Would you know, Danny?  Yeah, I think so.  You get caught doing that.  But how are you gonna get caught?  Motherfucker punch you in the face.  It's like, dude, what are you doing?  You're trying to fucking get out of here.  When you're sipping Arizona iced tea out of a snifter, you tend to know. 
[01:51:30]  Well, you break it out later in the party when people are nice and buzzed.  And you can't get real shit.  You gotta like get kind of good stuff.  Yeah, I know.  You can't go too cheap and, you know what I mean?  Get a fucking $10 bottle of cognac and pour it in.  So, whatever.  I need strategy.  I'm gonna have to work out a strategy now that happens.  Let me know what happens with that.  That's like a weapon.  Yeah, this is a strategy, man.  You got like a superpower.  Yeah, I felt like I could never open it up because I felt like I needed something really 
[01:52:00]  special happening.  I was saving it for when I bought a house and then I bought a house and I didn't open it.  Kid wasn't special enough to crack it open or?  Well, with who though?  Like it's cognac.  Who drinks cognac?  That's true.  I might drink it out of my girl's asshole.  I'm gonna figure out what I'm gonna do with it.  I'm gonna invent something.  You might have started a drunk.  I might have to taste it.  Patrice, they want me to tweet a picture.  Do you want to be in it? 
[01:52:30]  Of my Louis the...  Hell no!  These niggas I live there!  They might not listen to this radio, but they look at Twitter and shit.  These motherfuckers see me with it.  They already debating whether to kick my door and fucking rape me while I'm asleep.  That's why I hate it raining.  Is that my door getting kicked in?  Swear to God, man.  I gotta buy one of them things from you, man.  File that number off or something.  You gotta help me out.  File that number off.  The number is everywhere now, isn't it?  I got a bunch of box cutters around me.  You can't go old school with that shit, right? 
[01:53:00]  The numbers are everywhere?  The numbers are very hard to file them off.  It's very hard?  They use an acid.  You know, it penetrates the steel, and you can pull those numbers through.  It penetrates the steel real deep.  Even if it's filed down...  So all that bullshit, like an unmarked gun thing.  Yeah, a lot of times.  There's ways to do it, but it's so fucking illegal.  There are guys that, like, you damage the rifling inside the barrel so that the bullet,  when ballistics gets a hold of it, they can't match it up to the barrel of the gun. 
[01:53:30]  So there's nothing you can do?  No.  Nothing you want.  Hey, find alternative weapons.  Patrice, does this make us, like, true friends where I can now use, you know, the N-word?  You was using it before.  No, not to your face.  What is this floating inside of here?  Are you serious?  Nigga, there's flies in this shit.  It's the worm.  I eat the worm.  Oh, okay, all right.  What are they, bubbles?  That's close.  And it's, and he, and him, and I'm just looking at it.  Oh, I got...  You can see all the times he thought about it, and didn't. 
[01:54:00]  Fingerprints?  A bunch of dirty, I thought about it, fingerprints, and he wanted, he wanted...  You want in on this thing?  I want a dirty fingerprint.  Wait, just get my, just get my fingers.  All right, tilt it over, those big ass...  Oops.  Get the chain, too.  You look badass.  All right.  Not your face?  You want your face?  I don't give a fuck, whatever.  All right, well, here we go.  Maybe I'll make a face, don't try to rob me, face.  Yeah, yeah, make a...  Of course you turn.  It's a...  Of course you turn.  Patrice is making a great, don't try to rob me, face. 
[01:54:30]  Oh, here we go, here we go.  That's such a good fucking...  Don't try to rob me, James.  Holy shit.  Oh, that's classic.  You're right about that.  I've pulled that bottle out many times.  This is some fucking fingerprints.  Oh, you can see right where he's thought about it.  You might...  Wait a minute, though.  So what's some of the...  Can you give me two or three?  You might have to...  Almost drinking stories?  Like, you was like, it's going to happen?  Here it comes.  Not to the kitty?  Honestly, no, because I just don't like that.  I just don't like cognac.  I had no reason to open it up. 
[01:55:00]  It's good for a little sip.  I haven't opened mine up either.  I wanted to drink...  I mean, I wanted to drink it with my dad.  Have a shot with my dad.  But that ain't happening.  That would be very inconvenient right now.  Well, not if you have a shovel.  Yeah.  Mine, too.  I'd have to mix it with...  That didn't happen.  I'd have to mix it with his ashes.  Yeah.  I think that's why, because I...  I think I was going to open it up when I got a house and do it with my dad.  But, you know, whatever.  How long have you had it?  I told you, like 12 years.  That's been sitting around.  That's been in four or five different places.  Who gave us that shit? 
[01:55:30]  One of the comedy clubs.  Yeah.  I think it was Rascals.  Wow.  That's fucking fantastic.  Who was it?  I don't know.  Wait a minute.  So it's even older.  12 year old.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  So it has to be more...  It's got to be more than just if you went out and bought it now.  And it must have the paperwork when it came out.  Dude, I haven't totally in there.  All that shit's in there.  I haven't touched anything.  The case, everything.  I'll tweet the picture for people.  They'll know.  I'm just laughing at...  I'm laughing at the people out there going...  They don't... 
[01:56:00]  What somebody would do with some Louis XIII that's sitting there like...  Oh, come on.  And I'm just sitting there...  Hmm.  Hmm.  As I'm fighting pit bulls...  Hmm.  Three...  With my strippers and cocaine party.  I could fucking...  And he's going to pour...  Wait a minute.  And he's going to pour some out for the homies who ain't here.  For the homies.  Nigga, what?  You crazy, man.  Is that a $300 fucking shot for your homies?  What is it?  I'm tweeting this.  So what is it?  The Louis X111? 
[01:56:30]  Is that what we do?  Ah, yeah.  Aye, aye, aye, whatever the fuck.  Yeah, it's them Roman numerals.  Shit.  Roman numerals.  I hand over my Louis Trey to Big Mama Proud.  See, then you get a little fucking Twitter love on top of it.  Look at this.  I hand over my Louis XIII to Big Mama Proud.  All right.  There you go.  I tweet it.  Man.  You live in a almost bad neighborhood, too, so...  I live in a very, like...  Borderline bad...  Borderline trick me.  Do you really?  When they...  Yeah, when they showed me the... 
[01:57:00]  When they showed me, like, they had a thing of the future of what the neighborhood was  going to look like.  Oh, wasn't it?  Oh, it was all white people and fucking overhead trains, ejecting cars.  Smiling white people.  Disney Epcot exhibit.  There's a cat that bought an arm.  This kid got a...  One of those four-door Porsches.  Yeah.  Those new sedan Porsches.  Like, you know, that just look...  And everybody...  Where I live is, like, SUVs, the most, you know, maybe a nice... 
[01:57:30]  Maybe a 400 Mercedes, not a six.  Right, right.  You know, it's some working-class people with some decent stuff, but he comes out with the  goddamn Porsche, 4-door Porsche.  I had to tell him, like, you know...  Not tell him, but I'm like, look, man, I think you should put that in the garage.  Because it's already the traffic from the...  Here's where I live.  The foot traffic from the hood...  Has changed because of his car?  The foot traffic...  The foot traffic from the hood to the shitty strip hood mall is past where I live. 
[01:58:00]  Like, it's...  Oh, man.  And it's a truck stop next door to it.  So it's just this oasis of what should have been white people all over the place.  That's hilarious.  Oh, that's bad.  And no one's buying.  So it's just a bunch of white people upset that they can't leave this motherfucker.  It's the saddest community.  It's the saddest community ever built.  They tricked motherfuckers so bad. 
[01:58:30]  I can't even refinance.  Really?  I can't refinance because this shit is worth...  It'll cost me money to refinance.  Well, I thought you were in kind of a good neighborhood.  They tricked everybody.  They fucking tricked.  It was supposed to be the up-and-coming neighborhood.  It was supposed to be one of these...  I remember.  Yep.  And it was like, oh, man, they're going to buy up all this.  Put up all these new bus routes, a train over there, a fucking limo service, a house  next door that everybody was sold.  It's just a place. 
[01:59:00]  One guy paints his front door every day because he's on the...  I'm off of the walkway.  Right.  He's on it.  Like, he's on the walk, and every day there's a gang sign painted on his door.  Oh, shit.  No kidding.  He has to keep it.  MS-13.  He just has a fucking...  He has to spray his...  Paint his door.  You can see where it's just layers and layers of paint.  Fuck.  One day I saw hot sauce on his door, hot sauce packs. 
[01:59:30]  Oh, shit.  What does that mean?  It's just...  You know what it is?  It's you walk by, and it's sort of people with money.  Yeah.  You know, I drive a SUV, a 2007.  It's nice.  Mm-hmm.  And everything is just like that in the range of whether it's a car or, you know, hybrids.  People just...  Yeah.  You know, working class people.  Yeah.  And...  But to that, it's just like...  Because I knew I grew up poor.  First thing we did when somebody had some money was... 
[02:00:00]  We didn't call it jealousy.  We just said, hey, those windows look delicious.  Man, those windows look very rockable.  Delicious.  Man, how many paint?  Seven?  Damn.  Run!  Now they don't run!  No.  They're killers.  Yeah.  That sucks.  So you...  Damn.  You couldn't even refinance? 
[02:00:30]  I can't even refinance.  I refinanced my ass off about a month ago.  What percentage did you go from to down?  Six...  Six-something.  Six...  What was it?  Six...  I had a bad one at first.  Six-point-seven to like a four-something.  Oh, my God.  Mid-fours.  How much did you save?  My mortgage payment was cut in half.  You cut your fucking mortgage in half?  In half.  I am telling you in half.  But you've been there how long?  They said I'm one of the lucky guys, and then I went through our guy Barry and said... 
[02:01:00]  And Barry's like, yep.  You're just lucked out.  You cut your fucking payment in half?  I don't even want to talk about it on the air.  Because people hate me enough already.  You cut your fucking...  I swear to God, almost exactly in half.  I have a...  I have a fucking two.  I had to take two for whatever reason.  And ready for this?  When I left, they go, and you'll be getting a check in a couple days.  I got $300.  Jesus.  You made money? 
[02:01:30]  I made money?  I don't get it.  I made money to cut my mortgage in half.  I'm telling you.  Well, in that area from not being two...  I don't want to give you the numbers, but I'm telling you it was cut in half.  They cut off an exit right there.  That's how fucking powerful Donald Trump is.  It's like, that exit's gone.  We won't be bothering you people over that area.  Yeah, yeah.  Cut off.  I thought they was redoing it.  They said, this is gone, motherfucker.  Right.  They closed an exit.  You have to go up ten more blocks, and they come back to be up in there.  Yep.  And that...  Yep. 
[02:02:00]  I'm fucking...  My heart hurts.  Because I got two.  It made me...  Yeah.  I have a six, seven, and I had to take another one.  Vinny knows this shit.  Vinny is amazing with this shit.  He helped me a lot with this house.  But there's another one I have that's fucked up that I got to pay off in 15 years.  Hook or crook.  And it's an eight...  Oh, fuck something.  Eight point seven, five or something. 
[02:02:30]  That's like a Loans R Us place.  Dude, it's...  And they're not going to gobble it all up.  They're not...  I mentioned to the guy who was actually trying to get me to do it.  And my credit's not bad.  But that motherfucker said, we can't gobble this one up.  I was trying to get mine refinanced.  And they were like, well, you got to...  I got to pump like a fuckload of money into it to get it down to a certain amount where  it makes sense.  Yeah.  I was knocking down my mortgage.  I was paying a lot of principal. 
[02:03:00]  So you don't...  Oh, you was paying...  How many years did you live there?  I'm up to three.  And I knocked it down a nice chunk.  And also, this is really going to piss off a lot of people because of the housing market  and shit.  My appraisal, my place went up.  Your property went up.  A lot.  Manhattan.  Well, that area is a motherfucking...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I bought in an area where it's up and coming.  They're building and building and building.  They're building all that whole area.  So I told my girl, we want to move.  I want something like that. 
[02:03:30]  I want to be in the suburbs with a nice spread.  Suburbia.  But we would be stupid to move anytime soon.  Because this place is going to just keep going up.  And I noticed...  And it's sneaky, too, how they did it.  How they built that area.  But it's built from...  It's built from 42nd up to maybe 100 or something.  Yeah, yeah.  Because I pulled over to take a piss on the side of the little thing off of the Henry Hudson.  Yeah, yeah.  And they created on that side just a new white world.  Like, it's like...  Yeah. 
[02:04:00]  Yeah, it's just some...  It used to be just swamps and shit and a bad area.  Yeah, and how they figured that out.  And Trump moved in.  It's amazing.  It's now bike paths and everything.  I used to piss on the side of the road and it's just nothing.  Like, it was somewhere you needed to piss.  Side of the road, yeah.  I turned around and it's a family.  I'm like...  It's a family staring at me like...  They're having a white picnic.  You're an asshole pissing on the side of the road.  I said, this is the piss spot.  I've been pissing here for years.  Yeah.  When I drive from fucking Boston, this is my piss spot. 
[02:04:30]  You just interrupted their white picnic.  Yes.  The whole white family with the baby in the back.  Just staring.  Like, you know, white people who do white things, like, you know, they do the jogging  and they're not afraid of anybody.  Like, they don't mind it.  They're not minding your business people.  They're like, wait a minute.  I know you're not pissing.  Like, the whole family staring at me going, I know you're not pissing right here.  I'm like, this used to be my piss spot.  This is the piss spot. 
[02:05:00]  I'm sorry.  It's a park now, motherfucker.  No, kids, go here, you bastard.  Brian wants in real fast.  Brian in South Carolina.  Brian.  Opie, did you say you got a check back for $300, too?  Yeah, I cut my mortgage payment in half and they gave me $300.  It sure is, sir.  It sure is.  And Patrice is working off a fucking 8% loan.  Holy fuck, man. 
[02:05:30]  I thought I got fucked with a 6-7, man.  And you're working on an 8.  I didn't want to say it's racist, but goddamn.  I had to take the long way out of Manhattan yesterday because they had the Columbus Day Parade.  And, man, as soon as you get uptown, you see Loans R Us places.  They're called Loans R Us.  They make it all friendly and nice to walk in and get a nice loan for yourself.  I can only imagine how much interest is at Loans R Us.  And you also know you're in a ghetto and there's a fast food restaurant that's two stories.  What's that about? 
[02:06:00]  In the white world, our fast food restaurants are one level.  All ground level.  But in the ghetto, it's two levels.  What's that about?  I always see it in the ghettos.  I'm laughing at the fact that that's just true.  It is true?  Wait a minute.  Some McDonald's are fucking...  I've never...  I'm telling you right now, I've never seen a two-story fast food restaurant unless I'm driving  through the ghetto.  Sometimes it'd be packed.  I like Anthony.  I get around.  I like to see what's going on out there. 
[02:06:30]  And I took the long way out of Manhattan.  And I'm like, wow.  There were Dunkin' Donuts, two stories.  There were McDonald's, two stories.  What else did I see?  I can't remember.  Maybe it's the spin.  I don't know.  I want to make an excuse.  It's true, right?  I don't know why it is.  Why is that?  I don't know why.  Two floors.  Oh, my God.  Why is that?  I don't know.  I've never noticed that shit.  It is true.  And bulletproof glass.  And we know what that's for.  Bulletproof glass.  Well, I didn't go into these places.  I'm not that crazy.  I'll drive through some areas, but I'm not going to stop. 
[02:07:00]  I don't know why white people don't explore the hood more, because nobody's going to do  anything to you.  That's just an easy thing to say.  I would stop and get out.  Yeah, it's just no one's going to do anything to you.  During the day, I would.  At night, honestly, I wouldn't stop and get out.  No.  They wouldn't do anything to you.  I understand.  You'd be a cop.  Even if he wasn't a cop, if something happened to you,  it's just not worth doing anything to you.  Really?  If something happened to Opie up in the hood somewhere at night,  do you understand?  Blonde, white dude is up in the hood.  Don't forget the blue eyes, Patrice.  Yeah, problems. 
[02:07:30]  The blue eyes.  Yeah, it's not.  No one needs that.  You'd be looked at a little suspect.  You need a little color again, and then you're in danger.  Just a little bit.  You know how many cops would be up in the fucking hood, like, just burning it down?  Just fucking racking heads and locking people up trying to figure out what the fuck happened.  An excuse to crack some skulls.  I was in Boston with Charles Stewart, man, when he just said, hey, black guy killed my wife.  Yeah, yeah.  I got pulled.  Everybody was up against the entire Roxbury was up against the wall.  Unbelievable when that guy said that.  And that was the one.  Creatures and everybody up against the wall. 
[02:08:00]  That was the one where she was stabbed and thrown off the bridge, right?  No, he shot her in a, he's pregnant wife, Charles Stewart.  He shot her in the head.  And then he shot himself.  And shot himself.  But didn't one of them go off the bridge or something?  He jumped.  He jumped.  Oh, he jumped.  Because they found him out.  Gotcha.  Oh, after the fact.  And then they had a guy that they had arrested for that, that they was going to just say,  you did it.  He did it.  But he, and then they found out Charles Stewart did it.  But then he was going to complain, but he was a felon.  Yeah.  And they said, look, you got some other stuff.  So you're not going to sue, are you? 
[02:08:30]  And he's like, move along.  Move along.  We'll turn our heads.  You just move along.  We made a bad mistake and you just keep going, my friend.  I'm getting called out.  There's a three-story McDonald's right there in Times Square.  Times Square is its own.  Times Square is, yeah.  That's just.  Right.  And there's one.  That's not normal neighborhood shit.  That's funny, though.  Oh, that makes me laugh.  God damn.  Why is there a three-story fast food restaurant?  But there's a lot.  I'm sure there's one or two here and there, but in the ghetto, I don't understand. 
[02:09:00]  Someone's got to explain that.  People enjoy their burgers.  Someone in real estate's got to explain that.  And they like hanging out on top of the, you know, that's not just where you eat.  Mm-hmm.  They feel like.  That's where you have your meetings.  They feel like you're living large.  Yeah, you look out the window.  Overlooking the street.  There's one guy that sits in the corner.  Everybody else has filet of fish.  He just has french fries and he's just surrounded.  And if you go to sit next to him, ten motherfuckers stand up with their hands in their pockets.  Holy shit.  Where the fuck are you going?  You think this M stands for? 
[02:09:30]  This M stands for Malik, motherfucker.  This is his motherfucking joy.  What do you do?  This stands for Malik's motherfucking McDonald's.  All right.  Now we got.  Oh, man.  We got Chad in Baltimore.  Chad, is this true or what?  Come on, man.  You know, you guys used to broadcast out of Northern Virginia, man.  Northern Virginia, PG County, you know, Anne Arundel County, not a single motherfucking  double-story McDonald's. 
[02:10:00]  You drive in New York Avenue into fucking D.C., double-story McDonald's.  And is that the ghetto?  I don't even know.  Hmm.  On the right-hand side, going to New York Avenue, right to Florida Avenue.  But country ghetto's a whole nother thing from city ghetto.  Yeah, that's true.  Baltimore is, because country ghetto is, it's easy going.  Like, even like the one thing I noticed about, I just got back from North Carolina, where  you go outside of the tri-state area in New England, black people are really, really, really 
[02:10:30]  friendly.  Mm-hmm.  Seriously.  Like, and it's not, I think, two-story McDonald's is to keep, the fact that if you're in the hood,  and this is a, it might be a smart move, this might be it.  You go upstairs, you have an upstairs, so it's not, you don't scare people from not coming  into your place.  So you say, go on upstairs and fucking throw garbage around.  Gang activity at the registers.  And threaten the Indian guy that's just wiping the tables up. 
[02:11:00]  And you eat upstairs so that people can come in and not feel like they're scared to come  in a crowd that's going to burst into gunfire at any moment.  But down South is so, it's a, it's a, they don't even have the bulletproof glass on the  Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Where I live, Kentucky Fried Chicken is shut down, man.  Try to rob Kentucky Fried fucking chicken.  It's like, it's like lock stock and smoking barrels with the bitch with a gun and push  a button and the cage go up. 
[02:11:30]  That's, that's how it is.  That's, that's the Kentucky Fried Chicken, man.  You can't, it's bulletproof glass, like the, the girl's face through the glass is warped  because the glass is so thick.  Well, what do you have?  I like to make a withdrawal of a bucket of chicken.  Do you have a withdrawal slip?  Yeah, I got one right here.  I'm sorry, your count only has a wing and a leg in it.  No, just give me that shit, motherfucker.  You're fucking banging.  You're overdrawing some shrimp pops. 
[02:12:00]  It's a popcorn shrimp.  I like how Patrice said her face is distorted.  It's distorted.  The glass is so thick.  The funhouse, giant funhouse bulletproof glass.  You don't even know if she's good looking or not.  It's like looking at Shamu through the SeaWorld window.  And the, and the fucking, instead of the magic marker, it's the scratch key gang sign.  So it's like, you just, a motherfucker just scratched it.  Stay there forever.  It's scratch-eedy.  They call it scratch-eedy. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, is that good, man?  Holy fuck, man.  Bulletproof glass.  Oh, black people gotta defend everything.  That's just funny.  And then what, they got that Lazy Susan whirly, twirly thing to get your...  The thing where they put the chicken in, turn it around, and spit it.  The Lazy Susan.  So you can't put the gun in.  If you put the gun in, the black girl just presses the...  It's like the post office when you gotta mail like a really large package.  You gotta, the one window has to go down and lock before the other one can come up.  Oh, it's an airlock, yeah.  Open the pod bait doors, Hal. 
[02:13:00]  Is it insulting to live that way?  No.  No?  That's what it is.  It's no.  It's, you know what?  This is a world I don't know anything about.  It's not insulting to...  It's insulting that you have to live that way.  It's not insulting that you...  Because the motherfuckers will go in there and rob you every night.  And they don't have nothing but teenage girls working in these places till midnight.  Yeah.  That is crazy.  So the poor girls, when they leave, and there's signs everywhere...  Vulnerable. 
[02:13:30]  No money on premises.  Somebody takes the money or whatever.  It's like, we don't know where it went.  Even in the supermarket, they have these things that suck the money up now.  Jesus Christ!  Like, almost after every transaction, they put it in a little thing, and it sucks money  up to go away.  It goes to some white guy's desk where he goes, ma-ha-ha-ha-ha!  Big pile of money.  The monopoly guy!  Black people's money!  Let me just keep counting it!  It just keeps getting sucked up here!  Some guy with a handlebar mustache.  Yeah, yeah.  He's twirling his mustache.  Yeah, uh-uh-uh! 
[02:14:00]  It's dangerous, man.  So is it a shame?  It's gotten to that point where the money's just sucked away.  Dude...  I haven't seen that either.  God damn.  Yeah, man.  They don't even have tellers anymore.  It's just...  It's just...  That's the guy at the top of the front.  Monopoly guy.  Come here to your chest.  They'll kill you over some chicken.  I always announce, please, just don't...  Look, take it.  Yeah, just don't kill me.  Take, man.  Don't kill me over this shit, please.  Just don't kill me.  Please.  I could get a new wallet.  I see your face, but I don't see it.  I don't see it. 
[02:14:30]  I'm dying back, nigga.  I got retinopathy.  I'll get all kinds of new shit.  Just don't fucking kill me.  Don't fucking kill me, man.  Do not kill me over this shit, man.  I'm not going to tell anybody anything.  It ain't even about not snitching.  It's just go...  Just steal and go, man.  Take this shit.  If I see you with it on, I'm not going to try to get it back.  I'm fucking trying to...  These motherfuckers will kill you.  Are they showing...  Like, are they literally pulling guns out, pointing them and taking money these days?  Yes, they have to. 
[02:15:00]  The preferred way to rob somebody.  No one's playing around.  When I was a kid...  No one's fucking around.  When I was a kid, I got robbed twice.  Yeah.  One was implied gunpoint, and one was actual gunpoint.  Oh, implied was what?  He did the old school...  That nigga did the Texas finger in the pocket.  Nah, Mark J.  And took his hand out and took the money and put the gun...  Same hand.  With the finger gun, nigga.  But he didn't have to do much else.  I wasn't fucking with him.  I don't know any karate moves. 
[02:15:30]  I don't even know...  Even if I got a motherfucker who was quick enough to hold him, I wouldn't know what to do.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, I would do a movie thing and just keep hitting his hand on something really hard,  and maybe he'll drop it, and I'm like, get the fuck out of here.  How scary is it, though, to just watch that barrel of the gun as you're trying to hold it,  just slowly turning toward your face?  Like, and you're trying your best to not...  The only thing you get mad enough to do is die.  Meaning, you know what?  I'm so mad right now.  I'm willing to take this gunshot so you don't have satisfaction. 
[02:16:00]  I hate you so much for this.  Yeah.  The other one, I got robbed with a gun, and a little small caliber.  I don't know.  You know, to me, people aren't even scared of .22s who know guns.  They think .22s are funny.  They'll fuck you up.  But they'll kill you, whatever.  But he knew he could rob me at this point.  This is why I'm so angry.  I'm so quick and angry.  Because the guy had been testing me all the way that night.  We was playing basketball, and just some dude was around, just bumping into everybody.  And he was just fine. 
[02:16:30]  But you were playing the guy on the basketball court?  He was playing basketball, yeah.  Oh, what a prick.  A pickup game?  Pickup game.  Don't know the guy?  Don't know the guy.  He's just elbowing you the entire game?  Not elbowing.  He was...  What the fuck?  He was just lurking.  He was lurking.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, if I...  Look, it's called the punk test.  So, like, it's like five phases.  I bump into you.  You go, hey, why...  Yeah, yeah, why...  There was enough room for me and you to walk without you bumping into?  Then it was like...  Then it's like a step on your foot.  Then it's like a... 
[02:17:00]  Oops, a hard pinch.  You're like...  He's doing recon on your ass.  He's doing recon.  And by the time he decides he's going to make up whatever story he is, they're going to rob you...  Like, he even made up a story.  He go, yo, I think you was...  Yo, you did something to my cousin.  Oh, shit.  Why do you need an excuse?  At this point...  If you have a gun.  And I was so ashamed because...  To really make it hurt?  What the fuck?  He goes like this.  He goes...  I love this shit.  He goes, hey, yo.  And I said, uh-oh.  So, I tried to be hardcore. 
[02:17:30]  Right away.  I tried to be hardcore, but he had already given me the punk test.  I felt miserable.  Maz no.  So, I felt...  Maz no.  And so...  Punk test.  He fell.  Why do you think Maz is a 12 degree black belt?  Somebody got him with the punk test when he was fucking young.  Oh, shit.  So, he goes, yo.  And then I go, yo, what's up, yo?  Like...  But he already knew.  And he's like, yo, man.  What the fuck you mean?  What's up?  I said, whoops. 
[02:18:00]  I stuck my heart in my pocket just so you don't take that away.  But I need my heartbeat.  That motherfucker, he fucking...  He didn't need a gun at that point, but he knew it.  He already knew.  Yeah.  The fucking...  He stole...  I had one of those breakdancers.  I was the first motherfucker to have a breakdancing puma suit.  It was old school.  Get the...  If you look at...  You didn't take your puma suit, did he?  He took my 4X tall puma suit.  What were you wearing?  Luckily...  Holy shit. 
[02:18:30]  I had on...  This is...  This is so fucked up.  Luckily, I had on a pair of not sexy sweatpants because it was a little cold.  So I had some non-sexy sweatpants under the puma suit and a sweater under the puma suit jacket.  And he took my puma suit.  Your pants and everything.  He took my pants.  Now, what did he say?  What did he say?  He said, yo, nigga. 
[02:19:00]  Um...  Yo, you the motherfucker that fucking...  You...  Oh, you the nigga that was fucking with my cousin, yo.  Yo, what the fuck?  You too big to be fucking with my cousin, nigga.  I was like...  Oh, no.  What cousin?  I was trying to be hard.  He said, shut the fuck up, nigga.  He just...  He didn't even pull it.  He showed me the G of the gun, nigga.  Like, I don't know.  It was just whatever he showed you.  And I was standing there frozen, man.  So now, what...  Are you thinking he's gonna take your puma suit?  No, I'm thinking... 
[02:19:30]  So when he says...  I'm thinking...  He's gonna shoot you, man.  No, I'm...  I know he didn't think that I really did something to his stupid cousin.  Right.  I didn't know what he wanted.  But did you just...  Might have been sneakers, because I had to breakdance and puma sneakers, too.  I was dressed...  I was dressed like Ozone from breaking, nigga.  I'm telling you.  But now when he said...  Yo, give me that puma suit, yo.  Yo, give me a suit, yo.  Are you thinking...  Are you fucking shitting me?  You want my clothes?  No, because back then, people were dying over two things. 
[02:20:00]  Eight ball jackets?  Eight jackets.  But back then, it was bombers.  Bombers.  They were dying...  If you had a...  And it didn't have to be leather.  If you had a bomber, a nice jacket, you got killed.  Yeah.  And big radios that you would carry on your shoulder.  Yeah, the big boom boxes.  Why would you walk around that way, then?  Because you fucking...  Because that's the way you walked around.  You had to.  Why would you increase your odds, though?  Holy shit.  What are you going to do?  That's what...  But I'm telling you...  This is my dumb world.  I don't get this world.  Black people like wolf tick. 
[02:20:30]  We don't like to be punks.  Like...  I know it's...  Dude, look.  It's unexplainable, but we don't like to...  So...  It's the dozens.  It's wolf tick.  It's like...  It's like, fuck that.  I'm carrying my shit.  I'm carrying what I carry.  So, did you have to take your pants off in front of everyone?  I took my...  In front of him and another motherfucker.  Were they laughing?  Were they having a motherfucker with him?  Were they laughing?  Were they rubbing it in when you were taking them off?  Nigga!  When he said, go around the corner...  I get the fuck out of here. 
[02:21:00]  I walked around the corner.  As soon as I didn't see him...  You've never seen a 300-pound person run faster.  As soon as he let me go...  Because he could have been like, you know what?  Let me just...  Yeah, fuck this guy.  I think he saw me.  He looks like a guy that might say so.  And I ran...  And I think I looked back and I saw them peeking.  They was not going to chase me.  Because I ran fast.  Holy shit.  Then I went over to my boy's house.  Because he was close.  Yeah, let's get these motherfuckers.  No.  No?  He laughed. 
[02:21:30]  They all laughed.  They laughed.  I was sitting there...  You didn't pull any boys in the hood shit?  That's what I was doing!  That was it!  I love that one.  I fucking was punching the air.  Like, what the fuck do you want?  He was laughing and shit.  Some boys in the hood shit.  He was laughing.  The thing about this guy...  He was notorious.  I didn't feel so bad.  Oh, god damn.  He was notorious, this guy.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  I've seen him three more times robbing three other people.  Holy shit.  In daylight around there.  He was... 
[02:22:00]  Brazen!  He was fucking a public enemy, this guy.  I've seen him at a wrestling match.  Robbing people.  You ever find out what happened to him?  No, I don't...  Hopefully gunned down somewhere.  He's something not good.  I mean...  I'm sure he's...  Yeah.  His luck was gonna run out.  That man was Barack Obama.  I mean, it ain't like karma worse.  Yeah, yeah.  But at this point, this day...  Back then, it was...  They let you live, man.  Yeah, yeah.  In that situation now, they'd shoot me. 
[02:22:30]  They would shoot me just...  Because they wanted to pull that trigger, man.  There's motherfuckers that have died for less.  Wait until you take the Puma, sir.  That's what I'll tell you.  Can't be stitching up a hole in that.  Oh, I was dressed like a motherfucker.  I was...  I thought this story was gonna end with you and boxers.  Oh, if you were standing there and boxers.  Oh, shit.  And a wife beater.  And no shoes.  And no shoes.  No shoes.  And no shoes in boxers.  I would have been happy.  And that was pre-diabetes, so I would have walked over glass and everything to get the  fuck out of there.  Cut up feet. 
[02:23:00]  Rocks.  Oh, my God.  Damn.  That's fucked up.  But after that, it's the punk test.  And it fucked me up for the rest of my life.  I might have been 13, 14, but I was a big motherfucker.  I was already in high school playing football.  And I always say, you know, don't let a motherfucker get to the next place.  Yeah.  In anything.  Like, and even in business, you just go, no, I'm not gonna...  Right at level one.  It's like, oh, if you...  You know, just...  You know, like the advice you get in show business.  Hey, man, just do it this way this time. 
[02:23:30]  And then the next time, you can get more.  Like, no, once a motherfucker...  Fuck you and your butt.  He wants to take four more pumps.  You think he's gonna take one pump?  Four more.  This guy bumped into me.  I should have said...  He's like a man with one pump.  I should have said, man, there was a lot of room, man.  Whatever the fuck you trying to do, you better do it.  Don't put me through this shit.  Oh, yeah.  So that's what you're like, you should have said.  I should have just said, yo, man, whatever the fuck you doing, do it. 
[02:24:00]  Because I don't have a gun, but don't play me.  Was he a big guy?  No, it was two of them.  It was a little...  I don't want to say his name.  I feel like saying his name, but I'm not going to say his name.  Because I don't know if he's still...  Little motherfucker.  But they used to rob drug dealers, too.  They weren't no...  They just saw my breakdancing Puma suit.  They can't be alive.  Right when they saw that suit, they were probably like, I am jacking that motherfucker for his suit.  Dude, my moms used to go out to get me some shit sometimes, man.  I had a big...  I was... 
[02:24:30]  I had to be 250, 260 then.  So it was a 3X, at least.  What the fuck was he going to do with that?  Sell it to a big motherfucker.  Then somebody that was breakdancing in my shit.  He should have took the shoes, too.  I think he was being...  I think he was being merciful.  Yeah, he was...  A little mercy on you.  He was being benevolent.  Let the little motherfucker...  Hey, Nick, go ahead.  Yeah, go ahead.  14 years old.  14, man.  This motherfucker was a hard criminal.  You must have been fucking feeling just, like, so violated. 
[02:25:00]  Yeah.  That must have been a violating feeling.  A lot of things happen to me as a kid.  A guy was in the house when I came home from school in time, in the 5th grade.  You know, I was a latchkey kid.  He swung in through the...  We live in the third floor, the top of the building.  He swung in through the window.  Swung in through the window.  And was in there.  Don't make it that easy for Anthony, please.  Don't make it that easy for him.  I'm telling you the truth.  Make him work for it, Patrice, will you? 
[02:25:30]  Jesus.  He swung through the window.  And he was in the house, man.  I was 10 or something in 5th grade.  And he was standing there with a knife and shit.  Matter of fact, I ain't gonna lie, it was a butter knife.  But I was just too...  A knife to knife.  I was just too nervous to know what to do.  Yeah.  And that fucker locked me in the closet.  Shit.  But I had knew...  He was not a hardened guy.  Because he was kind of nervous.  But I was too young to even know.  And I don't know.  I probably was big enough to fuck him up.  Was he a cracky, you think?  It was probably a new crack. 
[02:26:00]  What were you gonna do?  A little desperate.  So, what?  Mom came home and had to let you out of the closet?  Yeah.  And she was mad.  That shit didn't come home.  It was gangster.  She was kind of mad at you.  She was kind of mad that I let this little motherfucker lock me in the closet.  She said, how many were there?  It was just one.  Like, you fucking went in the closet.  And this nigga, you know what I remember from that?  What did they take?  Do you remember?  I remember what he took.  Yeah.  My mother, when we used to sell spices for school, you know, back then we would sell spices.  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  Now it's candy bars.  Now it's candy bars, but it used to be spices.  My mother sold enough spices for me to get a TV.  He stole my spice TV.  That motherfucker stole my spice prize television.  That cocksucker.  My mother sold enough for you to choose what you wanted in the magazine.  I had my little spice.  This is terrible.  I know.  It's so.  This is terrible shit.  I'm so glad I gave you a gift today.  I'm so glad today's the day I gave you the gift.  I cannot believe how terrible this shit is. 
[02:27:00]  It's horrendous.  It just, to me, seems so violating.  It is.  And that's why you think I'm so mad.  Like, it's just, I'd be mad all the time.  It's like, you've got to carry that anger with you.  Yeah, because you just go, you just go, that's a lot of people.  I got a friend that boxes now that he boxes because he's, it was some things that happened  to him and he just wants to beat people up, man.  The only thing I remember.  He just wants to beat you up.  And from my youth, the only thing I remember that was really violating to me was this one 
[02:27:30]  kid in front of these stores used to slap box with me every so often.  And I was never good at fighting or anything.  I never knew how to block anything.  So this, this guy was just able to smack me around and shit, but it was light, like taps  and shit like that.  And one day he was with two of his friends and he's like, Hey, give me a get over here.  It was like, Oh fuck.  And he starts slap boxing.  So he throws a slap at me and I lean back and I come back forward and I'll fucking right 
[02:28:00]  in this was waiting for me.  Bam.  He clocked me in the eye.  I went down on my ass blind in that eye.  Like it was just couldn't see.  I, I grabbed my eye and just felt warm all over blood pouring down my fucking face.  And I looked up enough with one eye to see him and his friends going, like laughing at  me, almost knocked out on my ass, bleeding from my eye. 
[02:28:30]  And I can't tell you how many years like that's stuck in my head.  You never heal from certain things.  To this day.  And all I wanted to do was fucking kill him.  Is that the guns?  And I had fantasies about like, is that the guns?  Is that the guns?  That's probably where to go.  Dude, if you.  Gabriel Mayers.  You never forget the name.  Remember the name?  Oh no, no, no.  And you think you grew older.  But see where I grew up, it was, there was, this was before gangs. 
[02:29:00]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, when I was from, you know, three to 15, there was no gangs.  No, no.  It was the rough kids and the silly kids.  I was a silly motherfucker.  I was funny and I played ball and then it was the street kids.  And your whole life was trying to avoid those kids.  You took a new route, pick a route and go around the corner.  You see the motherfuckers coming.  You, you build your quick escape, James Bond.  You unpack your James Bond, uh, submarine car, nigga, and go in the lake. 
[02:29:30]  Like, and there was these motherfuckers that live next door.  Um, I know, I remember their names too.  I just, I'm going to say they can't, they, they caught one of my friends, man, by himself.  Man, they made him do two things and I felt bad for him to this day.  They made him hold a Dixie cup so they could shoot, uh, rocks with a, with homemade slingshots  at the Dixie cup as target practice.  And they made him be a basketball hoop.  Oh God. 
[02:30:00]  So he made his arms.  They made him hold his arms.  So your face is the backboard.  And they would shoot and the ball would hit his face and go into the, into his arm.  And all you know is, all you can do is go, man, I'm glad they didn't catch me today.  Yeah.  That's why, that's why this whole cyber bullying thing is just horse shit in the end.  Cause we all grew up with this.  Are you telling me the guy, are you telling me after Puma suit, I shouldn't have fucking 
[02:30:30]  right.  Jumped off a break.  A couple of sleeping pills.  It's like, you know, you know, shit.  It's horrible what happened to that kid.  I felt bad for that kid.  But of course it's not, but it's not an epidemic, but it's always been around at  least cyber bullying, some form of bullying, leaving me with a black eye and fucking blood  pouring out.  And someone else now has to deal with your fucking, the redemption.  Like you're going to be quick to blow a fucking, and when you shoot, I ain't getting hit again, 
[02:31:00]  motherfucker.  Yeah.  If you think I'm going to ever get hit in my eye again, you fucking said the mistake.  We don't have to do this obviously, but, uh, we could take phone calls for days about how  people were bullied growing up or did the bullying.  Yes.  And I even said some of the bullies were even bullied.  I had to hit, I had to, I, the first time I stood up for myself and this is why TV is  very important, by the way, this motherfucker was fucking with me.  I said, I ain't taking this shit no more, man.  Fuck this. 
[02:31:30]  Right.  Um, I remember my man Gomez, I have to say this Gomez, uh, this dude had did something to  me the day before he had punched me in the face and I had thought about it all night.  Could you tell me how old you are for reference?  Uh, 15, 15, this is when I said, I want to wear my own Puma suit.  I can't deal with not wearing my Puma suit ever again.  And, uh, and this motherfucker did, I think he had, he had, uh, oh no, it was two days  before we were playing basketball and he passed me the ball and I missed the pass on, but I 
[02:32:00]  guess, you know, you want to fight somebody anyway and you just make up anything to fight.  So we, we had a fight or something, but I, I had said, I took the high road.  Like, look, man, I don't want to, you know, you get older, they, when you're younger that  you're a punk older, you're like, are you serious?  But we, he was just like, follow me home.  I went home and the next day on the bus, Gomez was like, yo, let me hold your bag.  Cause you got to do what you got to do.  I remember Gomez Gomez, Gomez actually, this nigga, that's the nigga that said, man, you 
[02:32:30]  got no choice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's time.  But I had, um, you ever see bad boys with champagne?  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Love that one.  Well, I didn't have Coke cans to put into a, into a, um, into the pillowcase.  Into a pillowcase.  I put it, I put my mother had aerobic weights and I put aerobic weights in a plastic bag  and took it to the bus and I just started swinging on her with aerobic weight.  Fuck.  But what happened is I, I went back to hit that third swing and I really didn't get  them good. 
[02:33:00]  Like I wanted to, they flew out the back of the bag and I, and so I hit them twice with  just an empty bag.  So I just had to jump on them and just start fighting.  And once my fist, I just wasn't a fighter when I was growing up.  Once my fist, I was physical, but not just punching people.  But once my fist started hitting his face, I was like, this is not so bad.  And he swung and hit me and we were fighting. 
[02:33:30]  And I go, this is not so bad to get fucked up and then possibly fuck somebody else up.  You know, I was 300 pounds.  So that couldn't have felt good to him.  No.  So I have my, anytime they, you know, you get hit in the eye, you see the shine, that,  that big shine and then it goes back to regular or in the nose, both eyes shine and they go  back within your nose is like, and I'm like, this ain't been so, imagine like his must feel  really bad.  So that was when I was like, I don't want to deal with this no more. 
[02:34:00]  And that was literally the last time, but I still, it's my fucking pull a gun out.  I'm going to look, man, take what you got to take.  But in terms of a motherfucker, like balling up his fist, I used to be scared to fight,  but it's not a motherfucker balling up his fist.  You know, I'll take a punch, take a fucking punch in the face.  Fuck that shit.  I've never been very good at taking a punch though, but it's like to give one, it's worth  taking one.  It just glass jaw to hit a motherfucker.  You know, it hurts.  Knock right the fuck.  If you just, if you just kind of lightly hit yourself in the face, just a little harder 
[02:34:30]  than soft, that fucking hurts.  It hurts.  Especially when you get older, it's just enough.  Oh, now you just fucking, you know, now you're just like, fuck.  That's only white trash.  Right.  You will only see white trash old guys on cops in the trailer park.  Just beefing.  Just bad motherfuckers, just drunk and punching each other in the face, all bloodied, their  t-shirts ripped.  He started talking shit about my wife and, oh. 
[02:35:00]  I've never been much of a, uh, a fighter.  I, I, I, I, yeah.  Like, you just.  I got out of a lot of shit by being a smart ass.  But you're funny though.  But see, funny people are funny.  Yeah, yeah.  So you get away with it.  Yeah, it was funny.  But, but where I'm from funny was too much laughing, too much giggling, too much.  You know how I became a victim in that Puma story?  I remember, I never fucking forgot.  Oh, what'd you do?  I was doing an impression of Deputy Dog. 
[02:35:30]  Oh.  In the fucking hood.  That guy.  In the hood.  That guy just went like, oh yeah.  This fat pussy.  Oh shit.  And I was going, ee, ee, ee, ee.  Like, I was like, you know, we're laughing about Deputy Dog.  And this motherfucker was like, you just know he was like this motherfucker.  You're doing Deputy Dog, he's got a gun.  Oh, fuck, man.  God damn, man.  Oh shit, man. 
[02:36:00]  I remember that shit like it was yesterday.  I'm 40.  Still, still, if I had three genie wishes, nigga.  That would be one of them?  One of them.  Billion dollars, cure diabetes, and just, and burn this nigga every day.  Like, he's just on fire, but he won't die.  Just fucking pussy.  Fuck, that's a great story, Patrice.  God damn, is that fucking, just amazing.  You're playing Bananas this weekend, Patrice.  Yes, sir.  Poughkeepsie Bananas.  Poughkeepsie. 
[02:36:30]  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday.  BananasComedyClub.com or BigMamaProds on Twitter for all the info, right?  You tweet your gigs, don't you?  Order the PatriceO'Neal.com.  Oh yeah, let's start promoting that again.  PatriceO'Neal.com.  All right, we'll get into something different after the break.  Do you want to do country music today?  Whatever you want to do.  That's a bit people ask for all the time.  We look at the top ten country songs and try to figure out what the fucking songs are about  because we don't know the genre.  God damn. 
[02:37:00]  I'm just still stunned.  For the Puma Suit.  The Puma Suit.  From the damn Puma Suit.  The guy just knew from Deputy Dog and Stepping on Your Toe.  He just knew.  God damn.  He knew I was that guy.  That's a whole fucking strategy.  Amazing.  The Puma and Anthony show on the Virus Sirius XM.  I'm here with Patrice O'Neal today. 
[02:37:30]  That was a hell of an hour of radio right there, my friend.  Holy shit.  Y'all make me tell these stories I be forgetting.  I'm in shock.  Hey, did you watch the Jets?  Man, I knew I was coming in, so I went to sleep a little early.  I know the game started a little late.  Late because of the fucking lighting. 
[02:38:00]  The Jets are actually looking pretty goddamn good, man.  I don't want to jinx it, but they're looking all right, man.  But I don't trust Sanchez.  Fucking Sanchez is playing all right this year.  I know.  That's what I'm thinking.  I don't trust them.  I just don't trust them, kid.  So far, so good, though, with him.  He's doing, man.  And then Braylon Edwards.  Love Braylon Edwards.  Is the key to it all because he's actually like.  He's not dropping the ball.  He's not.  He's playing.  He is playing.  They are looking fucking good, man.  Four and one.  They're looking good. 
[02:38:30]  They might be the best team in the NFL right now.  Like if you're doing the.  I mean, people are saying Baltimore because Baltimore beat them.  Right.  But they could easily have won that game, too.  Yeah, that was a shitty game.  I don't know the NFL well enough to say the Jets are the best team in the league right now.  I just don't know.  That's an argument for sports radio.  I don't know.  But it's not.  I mean, it's not New Orleans and it's not Indianapolis.  No.  Of course not.  You've got some that have a decent record, but you know they're not really that record,  which is Kansas City. 
[02:39:00]  Right.  I mean, the Patriots possibly, but their defense is really bad this year.  Like, you know, people are scoring too much on them.  And what are they saying about Moss and Brady?  That they had to be separated or something.  They had a beef.  And they was.  Didn't Moss say that his haircut made him look like a girl or something?  Yeah, and then fuck it.  But Brady said, take off those stupid dreads.  You look like an asshole.  Like, and Moss said, fuck it, you look like a bitch.  Why would there be a problem there, man?  Brady's a great quarterback.  You want a great quarterback if you're Moss, right? 
[02:39:30]  Why would you want to go back and play with Brett Farmer?  That's just nothing.  It was money.  Patriots, it wasn't that argument.  It was just all about money in the end?  Yeah, people who don't, people who aren't dudes.  He had a better, he has a better shot winning with the fucking Patriots right now than the Vikings.  Yeah.  Right?  But he didn't, it was a money, the Patriots are fucking cheap.  They let, they let Richard Seymour go.  They're not loyal and they're cheap, man.  They're a disloyal, cheap team. 
[02:40:00]  That's the one thing.  I don't, I don't, I don't root for him as hard as I should.  I like the Patriots because I'm from Boston.  It's just like kind of in my blood.  Sure.  But they, but Kraft is an asshole, man.  He lets good people go.  Why would he do that?  Well, I guess he's got enough Super Bowls under his belt, right?  I guess if that's how he feels about it, but.  It's not worth, uh, worth it to him to really push.  But that argument was nothing because you argue it as a team.  Yeah, sure.  These sports guys who, you know, talking about Brett Favre and his, and this, and this thing saying it's a, like I heard somebody talking yesterday on 1050 and just talking about, dude, these are guys talking about he's either sick or is he just a bad guy? 
[02:40:30]  Bad guy.  Like talking how, man, I think.  Brett Favre?  Yes.  Because of this, because of this thing he's doing guy shit?  Yes.  That's, it's like, why do these guys do, you know, they go, man, it's, it has to be, I think it was Michael K.  But it wasn't Michael K.  Who was being not a dude. 
[02:41:00]  He was being careful not to go either side.  It was somebody else that was like, I don't get this, man.  And it's like, but Michael K. goes, throughout history, men have destroyed themselves over women.  Yeah.  And it's like, why?  You want to say over pussy.  Over pussy.  And he goes, why do they do that?  And then the other guy goes, is it because they're a bad guy?  Is it, but he was really serious.  But it's like, no.  A bad guy.  Brett Favre doesn't want to fucking ruin his life over, over pussy.  But he, he sent this picture. 
[02:41:30]  It's never good for a guy to send a picture of himself.  It's just not good, man.  It's not fucking good.  But it's just like these things.  It's no, it's really, to be honest, it's no big deal except for to you and your, and your woman.  And most of the time, these guys, women, they, they just go just, why can't you just not make me look bad?  Like, like, don't force me to have to divorce you.  Like, now I have to divorce you.  Like, in those situations, they both know what's going on. 
[02:42:00]  Just keep it between us, right?  And his wife was dealing with cancer.  So now, he's super douchey.  Super douche.  Fucking George Lopez getting a divorce.  His wife gives him a kidney.  Yeah, he's fucked.  Do you know what I'm saying?  Right, he's fucked.  So he looks like a real dirtbag.  I cheat on my bitch.  I gotta, I get caught.  This bitch, she gotta deal with the fact that she clips my toenails for me because I gotta be careful with my feet.  Like, I'm an asshole. 
[02:42:30]  You know what I'm saying?  My girl is willing to clip my toenails.  Sweetie, what's this boil right here on my ass?  Oh, that's weird looking.  Let me see.  Like, you get to.  Wow.  When your bitch loves you like that.  Yeah, that's hardcore.  Don't want to make her look like a fucking asshole.  That's real shit.  She gave up a kidney for George.  She gave up a fucking kidney.  Damn.  And he, and if you look at his wife, man, no, I mean, look, it is what it is.  I mean, I'm, I'm, I'm in the same business.  I mean, you know, I don't want to make the fucker mad.  He has a show.  But, if you see his wife, you, you have no choice but to cheat on, like, you can't stay 
[02:43:00]  faithful to that.  Kidney or no kidney.  Kidney or, bitch, take your kidney back.  I gotta get some pussy.  You see, she's like.  Can she get her kidney back, you think?  Nigga, I'd give it back to her.  I bet you there's a lawyer out there that will try to get that done.  That wants that kidney back?  That will try to get that done for her.  Get me that kidney back.  But you see that face?  She should be giving up organs to keep him.  He's the most famous Mexican on planet Earth.  That's great. 
[02:43:30]  Oh, fuck.  Oh, wow.  All right, Patrice.  He can get all kinds of.  All right.  He can get them Telemundo chicks.  George Wendt in a wig.  Oh, wow.  He's married to Chris Farley.  Chris Farley in a dark wig.  Chris Farley from that bit they used to do when they were all the chicks at the restaurant.  At the Gap.  And he's, and they get the divorce.  They're done.  You know, but evidently they're still friends or something because she probably just knows, man. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  She just knows.  Oof.  But he did, you know what the thing about him?  Oh, wow, wow.  He did what, the right thing.  He went to hookers.  Yeah.  And the hookers snitched on him.  That's the game now.  Not even safe with the hookers, Patrice.  Not even safe with the hookers, man.  That's what we're learning today.  Yeah, the hookers are ratting out all these guys.  Rattting themselves.  Ratting themselves.  Ratting them out.  I don't think Brett Favre's a bad guy for what he was doing.  Come on, man.  He was just trying to get some fucking pussy.  40 years old.  Obviously, he wasn't happy with his situation.  And he's being a decent dude. 
[02:44:30]  Look, his wife is sick, man.  And he was staying with her.  He went through that shit.  Yeah.  And he didn't leave her.  But it's like this young, pretty thing, man.  He was just like, man, I'm Brett fucking Wrangler Favre.  He's got a small penis.  Well, it happens, man.  He's got a small penis.  Look, you can't control the size of your dick.  You should have been sending it out there, Brett.  Matter of fact, let me cancel those three wishes.  I'm canceling killing this motherfucker.  Replace it with a bigger dick. 
[02:45:00]  With just a bigger dick.  But he thought, I guess he thought his small penis was going to get the job done.  That's what I'm saying.  But he might have a grower.  You know?  Who knows what the fuck Brett has?  I don't know, man.  But if you've got a grower, then you don't send it when it's not a fucking...  You don't send a midget...  Yeah.  You don't send it when it's fucking George Costanza from the pool size.  Yeah.  If you've got a grower, you should water it first before you send it to anybody.  Fucking water that shit.  Get some fertilizer. 
[02:45:30]  Get some miracle grow.  Jesus, Brett.  Jesus, Brett doesn't have a swinging dick.  Oh, wow.  I'm sorry, I got distracted from looking at these wonderful fucking Afghani people that  chopped this woman's nose off.  Why did they do that, Anthony?  Well, apparently she must have been fucking, you know, not wearing a burka or fucking...  She probably was raped.  And her noseless face is on the front cover of time?  Yeah, they cut her fucking nose off.  But then she comes here to get her new nose on.  The Taliban fucking cut her nose off. 
[02:46:00]  Oh, man.  They're some fucked up people.  We had the Brett Favre girl on our show, by the way, Patrice.  Yes, we did.  What, before the situation?  Yeah, before the situation, yeah.  Nice girl?  Yeah, I was trying.  I was trying.  She's a...  I mean, nice...  That's not...  Come on, Brett.  And then someone's claiming that he's got huge hands and that's why he looks so small.  Nah, you can see it.  Nah, that's a sickly little dick, man.  That's a sickly little dick.  That looks like...  But that's not guaranteed Brett.  What is that one? 
[02:46:30]  That's a weird one.  That's Brett?  Yeah, but that's like an angle.  Yeah, he's trying there.  Wow, Brett doesn't have a Hall of Fame dick, I'll tell you that.  I know, Hall of Famer.  Jesus Christ.  And that's pretty much, you know, full fucking...  Yeah, that's not a big dick, man.  There's nothing worse than growing up without a giant swinger, because, man, I used to go  home in my full football equipment, nigga, to take a shower.  They'd be taking showers.  They'd be in tuxedos on the bus.  I'm like, nigga, I'm taking a shower in the house. 
[02:47:00]  All I'm saying is, if you do have the small dick, you don't put that out there like that,  Patrice.  That's all.  I'm sorry.  This was the baby's room.  I'm really sorry.  She's laughing at his dick.  I was in the pool!  I was in the pool!  I was in the pool!  That's hilarious.  Shrinkage.  Well, we talked about sports.  We talked about it earlier, but we got to get your take on it.  You don't watch hockey. 
[02:47:30]  I heard this thing, though.  Have you seen it?  No.  It's awesome.  I heard it.  And sports needs this shit to come back.  They really do.  But they're going to end up suspending the kid.  If he's even a kid, I don't know.  I do a joke about how much...  We're talking about the blowjob gesture, obviously, to Avery.  Yeah.  I do a joke about how much we've changed in terms of sports.  When I was coming up playing football, this is a phenomenon that when I played, didn't happen. 
[02:48:00]  You hit a guy, and he doesn't get up.  We didn't hold hands with the other team.  Like, oh, please, make the most game.  Yeah.  And the crowd's quiet and worried.  We would do choreographed paralysis fucking dances.  That's right.  We would...  You know what I mean?  It was just weird.  You can't tackle...  Dude, you can't believe I was watching college football this weekend.  How many penalties they give out because this guy, this 250-pound guy who's running as fast as he can, is trying to hit another 250-pound guy. 
[02:48:30]  Yeah.  And he has to stop his fury so he doesn't hit him too hard.  Like, it's just...  Yeah, what the fuck is that?  What are you trying to...  What's going on?  What the fuck is going on, man?  This is the thing with the gesture?  Oh, yeah.  I want to see if the announcers even say anything.  And Avery gives DiPietro a little shower. 
[02:49:00]  That's what Wisniewski took exception to.  So, perhaps an appointment.  They don't even acknowledge it happened.  They didn't acknowledge it.  What did he say?  Perhaps an appointment?  What did he say?  He said perhaps an appointment.  Appointment of a penalty.  An appointment.  Maybe perhaps an appointment with Gary Bettman.  I don't know.  Maybe.  And it wasn't that...  That wasn't egregious at all.  That was pretty good, though.  It was funny. 
[02:49:30]  He's got it down pretty good.  It's fucking funny.  We've all done that.  He's like, what you going to do, pussy?  Oh, fuck you.  He's just calling him a fucking fag.  That's it.  We've all done that.  Exactly.  I love when that shit happens in sports.  He's not going to get suspended, though.  You don't think?  Abso-fucking-lutely not.  Why not?  What's your thought?  Hockey's a fringe sport.  No one cares.  And, I mean, honestly.  And it's not a sport that, like, the worst thing that ever happened, I think, and the 
[02:50:00]  guy got suspended for, what, 20 games?  Was some brutal hit where the dude could have died or something.  And I think that was a 20-game suspension.  Oh, that was over the head, behind him.  It was some brutal hit.  Just clocked him over the fucking head.  And I think it was a full season one one time, too.  But this is, that was because of, like, almost an assault.  But other than the blowjob thing, he'll get a fine for that, for lewd gesture.  No one, this is like some unprecedented thing.  They would have to invent it. 
[02:50:30]  Todd Bertuzzi?  Yeah.  Oh, very good, yeah.  Well, the name's come up.  And there was no penalty on the ice, either.  No, it was just the guy's fucking around in front of the net a little bit.  Yeah, hey, trust me.  That's why I don't think they want to.  How would you say it's a big suspension?  I think they're going to suspend him.  I don't think so, bro.  Should face suspension for gesture?  Who's saying that?  Scott Burns.  A sports blogger.  Some blogger.  Asshole.  That can't be a man anymore.  Shut up, young fruit.  Sports talk is the worst.  They're not men anymore.  They're not able. 
[02:51:00]  It's really strange to listen to.  There's one guy who's a dude, though.  There's some guys out there that are still doing it.  Colin Coward, man.  He'll say some fucking shit.  I like him, man.  I like him.  But in general, these guys are being so safe with what they're saying.  Well, you see the guys who you can't even...  Did you watch Monday Night Football?  Brett Favre?  It's obviously dick pictures and all that and how they were talking about it.  His little pink dick.  You didn't know what they were talking about because they were trying to talk around it.  Talk around it, yeah.  You can't use 9-11 analogies.  I don't... 
[02:51:30]  Why can't you use...  Like, the guy's like...  I think it was New Orleans.  Let's go in there and...  Oh, no.  It was a Katrina.  It wasn't 9-11.  It was like, let's go in there and beat those New Orleans Saints and, like, jump on them like Hurricane Katrina.  Like, you can't use bad thing analogies.  Let's fly a foot in...  Let's just fly two feet right into his ass.  Why can't you?  Because you can't.  Why? 
[02:52:00]  Oh, yeah.  Chris Simon, longest NHL suspension for the people that care.  30 games for stomping on the leg of Pittsburgh's Jarko Ruto, right, in December 2007.  30 games for violence.  Violence.  Yeah, Simon didn't play, man.  He was with the Islanders for a while, Chris Simon.  He did not play.  That guy was an animal.  But who's doing...  Is it any...  Can anybody stop this shit?  Like, is it any possible way?  What do you mean?  Like, if someone took a stand.  Like, who could take a stand? 
[02:52:30]  They've already stopped most of this.  No, no, no.  I mean, who could take a stand against, like, fucking being angry about this shit?  Like, who can do that?  And then change the whole culture where...  Let's not become even more pussies than we are.  Let's kind of take it back.  I don't know.  Like, in 60 minutes do it?  Like, if one of them...  Yeah, yeah.  If, like, Dan Rather or whoever's on there goes...  I think one of these coaches...  Fuck that.  I think one of these coaches has to just step up and say, fuck that.  They do.  It's not going to happen, really, though.  Joe Namath is that type of guy. 
[02:53:00]  Joe Namath is like...  Like, here...  No one...  They're getting in trouble for saying that they're...  It was Michael K's show I was listening to, and I don't know who was saying what, but I  know it was like...  It was dangerous to say that there shouldn't be women in the fucking locker room.  Like...  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That's not a dangerous thing to say.  It should not be women.  You should be able to discuss that openly, at least.  At least talk about it.  They were scared to talk about it openly.  It's unfair to me if I'm a young soldier with testosterone, and that bitch that was dealing 
[02:53:30]  with the Jets, she has one of the best asses I've ever seen in my entire life.  And she shows it off, too.  And she shows it, and she comes in there asking her a dumb question, and my dick is long,  and it fucking works correctly, and you're like, hey, what's up, baby?  Like, I should at least be able to find out if she's a fucking whore.  Right.  I shouldn't have to, like, approach her all the time as a gentleman.  I used to be like, yeah, I'm going to ask you a question, but let me ask you something.  You see that?  Yeah, you're in here.  You see what I got? 
[02:54:00]  What you thinking?  You thinking something?  What, you got a man?  Like, what's going on, baby?  Like, I can't treat her like a woman, and then she's saying it's harassment?  It's not harassment unless I do it twice.  So if I say...  Your fucking logic is brutal.  If I go, hey, baby, you know, you want to suck my dick?  You say, no.  All right, cool.  Yeah, you should be able to have one as a man.  You got to have one.  Oh, baby.  God, if you do it twice, though, all right.  Yeah, after she says stop, I'm done. 
[02:54:30]  It's not harassment.  That's something human research, guys.  The first one was a proposition.  You see my balls?  You want peace?  No.  All right.  Fair enough.  I know what this is about.  I'm going to move on and play a little fucking PlayStation 3 right now.  You ain't into me.  I can see.  You don't want to look like a whore, but I'm going to drop my number on the ground.  You can pick it up if you want to.  But you can't discuss...  Come on, though.  It's got to be somebody who has enough clout to turn the tide on that shit. 
[02:55:00]  It's just taking over.  That if they just say it, it'll just change.  It's just going to get worse and worse.  It's like saying women can't smoke anymore.  It's gone.  It's history.  It's fucking part of...  That's it.  And now it's like men can't be men.  You can't talk like that.  You can't fucking...  Like, it's fair to say you can't come in and see...  And then it's like, well...  And this was the show I was listening to.  It was like, well, if there's a...  They're going to make special press rooms.  Right?  And they go, well, if there's a press room, then the guys and the girls have to go in 
[02:55:30]  the press room.  That means the guy reporters can't be in the room.  Well, whatever.  But, yeah, they can.  Because if the guy...  The reporter's like talking to me and my dick is swinging next to him, as men, we're not  discussing anything sexual.  No.  So I said, yeah, when I hit the guy, man, I saw blood come out of his eyes.  I was a little nervous.  And it's like, all right, see you later, Cliff.  And you go into the room dressed and all the girls are like, you know, so this is Andrea  Kramer.  And this fucking... 
[02:56:00]  Do what they do.  Yeah, yeah.  But don't forget, it's men.  You see how annoyed those coaches are?  I'm going to tell you something.  Watch female sideline reporters.  Watch how annoyed.  The only one they don't get annoyed is with Reggie Miller's sister, Cheryl Miller in basketball.  Well, she's half a dude, though.  Right.  She gets some type of dude respect somehow.  She's half a dude and she really knows basketball.  That's where I'm at with that shit.  Like, I want the person to know the sport, not she's out there because they think she's 
[02:56:30]  hot.  But the chick that does football for ESPN...  Which one?  ...is not bad.  Rachel Nichols.  I don't know.  She seems to have figured out a way to not annoy people.  But then you got the funny looking one, the black girl on CBS.  But...  Or no, on Fox, where you just go...  Getting back to Cheryl Miller, though.  Yeah.  She's in a pickup game with some of these NBA players.  She's holding her own.  Well, she's the best female basketball player that ever fucking lived, ever. 
[02:57:00]  So she does get a little respect.  But that's the only one that talks and it's like...  Because she doesn't...  She kind of has this voice, so, you know...  She's half a dude.  Yeah.  She might be more of a dude than a brother.  She's to beat him.  Right.  But she's the only one where...  When they're talking to her, it's not like, you're annoying me.  Yeah.  I just want to get to the locker room.  When you talk to those fucking football coaches, they get annoyed.  Yeah, yeah.  They can't believe they have to deal with that crap. 
[02:57:30]  And one more sports thing, please.  Yeah.  I don't know if you watch football, but you are a football fan.  I just...  I am starting a campaign...  Again, there's some things...  Right now, you can't prove racism.  It's all fictitious, so you sound like an asshole when you talk about it.  Yeah.  But there's no way any nigga that talks like Lou Holtz would have a job on TV.  Any nigga who talks like Mr. Magoo...  Derek's working on a bit, right?  We're on this.  Lou Holtz...  Can we get a little sample?  I don't watch that show anymore, because Lou Holtz is the nigga. 
[02:58:00]  He's a slurpy, silly old man.  And Mark May, who's the black guy, super articulate, has to deal with this mush-mouthed, old senior  fucking citizen fucking up college football.  It's funny you bring this up, because the boys are working on something behind the scenes. 
[02:58:30]  Lou Holtz.  Lou Holtz.  We noticed a while ago that he just can't fucking speak.  And his teeth...  It sounds like he's trying to keep his teeth in.  Yeah, yeah.  And I know he's an old...  He's a fucking...  He's one of those football coaches.  You know?  Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.  He's a football coach.  But right now, he's an old, slurpy man.  And I'm not fucking...  I don't watch ESPN until he's gone.  I'm fucking finished.  We're going to have an example of that in a minute or two here.  But Vincent Bayonne, it's... 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  Can male reporters go into the women's volleyball team locker room?  No!  I know.  It's a double standard.  Not when they're naked.  Pussy out.  Titties out.  No.  And he picked a very good sport, because, I mean, who would want to go into the women's  locker room at a WNBA game?  I tell you, women's volleyball is the closest that I could come to jerking off without watching  porn, dude.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Those juicy asses, long legs.  Yeah.  And they have to bend over to get ready for the fucking...  Those delicious little sweaty women.  I love fucking college volleyball. 
[02:59:30]  I hold my dick.  Did you see the lingerie fucking football league yet?  No.  Somebody fucking tweeted.  From Vegas, right?  Somebody tweeted it.  It's a promotional video.  It's got 1.3 million views.  You got to see this shit.  Yeah.  Because I think we had some of the girls in here, if it's the same league.  You're thinking lingerie, football, like, oh, it's all cutesy.  You got to see what the fuck they're doing.  Beating the shit out of each other?  They're cutting the shit out of each other, and they got the hottest shit on. 
[03:00:00]  To be fair...  Danny left the studio.  I got to show you this.  It's unbelievable.  To be fair with the women, though, and it's the same thing, I think, the difference between  a women's strip club and a men's.  I think, to be fair to women on this one, is there's never any sexual danger when it comes  from women to men.  Like, if a man's walking around naked with his dick out and women are around, there's  just no danger to him.  But there's sexual thoughts going on. 
[03:00:30]  Yeah, but there's no danger to them.  But you think...  There's danger to naked women.  Yeah.  Look at this.  I know it's radio.  All right.  This is like the college floor.  Jesus, they are hitting each other.  They're really fucking playing.  And they're like, good evening, welcome to Seattle, LFL, Friday night football.  What's it called?  Cuntball? 
[03:01:00]  Do yourself a favor and check out this video sometime today on YouTube.  Lingerie Football League.  If you're going to see some real football, wonder no more.  They're just like wearing bikinis and fucking shoulder pads and a helmet.  Yeah.  Oh, my God, man.  They're really fucking hitting each other.  What a nice combination, huh?  Jesus. 
[03:01:30]  And her cervix is on the floor.  Fucking bitches fucking up.  They're just like, I have kids.  How great is that?  This is fantastic.  I'd watch this.  I would really watch this, yeah.  These girls know football.  Yeah, they seem to know the game, too.  Absolutely.  Lindsay Blaine right there with the interception.  A bunch of fucking guys in this stand.  Touchdown San Diego.  Look at that bitch run.  This is taking over arena football. 
[03:02:00]  It's arena football with girls.  Really hot girls.  Holy fuck.  Are they the greatest fucking panties ever?  Oh, my God.  They are just fucking in their underwear.  This is genius.  They're in their underwear.  This is what the WNBA, any, this is it.  Oh, face in our ass.  How'd they get hot girls to play, though?  That dirty, fishy scrum.  In our NFL football, it was exciting.  It was hard hitting.  Oh, fuck the hits. 
[03:02:30]  Wow.  Stopped her right up the line.  Football.  How do they get so many girls that are that hot that know how to fucking play in that way?  They are hardcore.  Fucking uneducated, sexy dummies that don't hit you for some money.  And the thing is, this is genius because this is what makes them, any sport where women are doing a sport and they don't exercise the thing that makes men into them.  So these girls are smart where they're doing football, but they're not trying to do it like men. 
[03:03:00]  They're doing it like women and having men go, oh, shit, look at that bitch.  And then they start to appreciate the fucking game.  But the WNBA, they play in men's, like, they should play in fucking bra and panties.  Yeah.  And lower the hoop, of course.  That would save the league.  Lower the hoop.  So they can dunk.  So they can get real hot girls in there, not these fucking freaks of nature.  It would save the league.  That league is about done.  This thing is, I want to watch it. 
[03:03:30]  By the way, thank you, Dry Blood Brooklyn.  Friday night on MTV2.  Every Friday night.  The lingerie football league.  I got to check it out now.  I guarantee it'll be huge.  I got to watch it now.  Wow.  Yeah, that promotional video is unbelievable.  Oh, you see them jiggly butts?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, I did.  That means they're hot but not in shape.  So it's just normal jiggly hot butts.  Regular jiggly hot butt girl.  Not no strong, not moving butts.  Did you see the girl get slammed in her ass?  The other girl's face is in her ass. 
[03:04:00]  It rippled.  And it rippled.  Just a little bit.  And they do the slow motion replay and her ass is rippling in this other girl's face.  Dirty, fishy scrum.  Scrum.  And they're smart enough not to have a big fat bra as a lineman, by the way.  They're all the same size.  They really do look all the same.  Like you said, they're not playing like men where they're getting some fat pigs on the  line at least to help their girls out.  And you're lucky I'm not the ref?  They're all the same exact size.  You're lucky I'm not the ref because they get hurt because I'm not blowing any whistles  because I'm just sitting there rubbing my dick. 
[03:04:30]  God damn.  Isn't that great?  Is that what they were promoting when they came in or was that another league?  I think this is it.  You was promoting this back at the other place a long time ago.  I don't know.  Yeah.  No, that was some broads that came in here, right?  The lingerie bowl.  About a year ago, maybe.  I think I was trying to pick up one of them, too.  Where's that bit?  The lingerie bowl.  You guys were talking about this forever.  It was in February they stopped by.  We got this bit.  We got a montage of all the women Anthony has tried to pick up on the show. 
[03:05:00]  When they come in just innocently to promote their horseshit.  What was the number one?  What's the furthest that ever?  Not sex, but like you almost.  Oh, it's got to be the penthouse, right?  The penthouse chick.  Yeah, he actually went out on a date and there might have been a little sucky face.  Yeah, that's fun, but nothing.  You know, fucking.  But now she avoids the show and you when she comes to New York.  Taylor Vixen.  What did you do to her?  What happened, man?  Taylor Vixen.  She's been to New York a few times since then.  I mean, we had a good time, but she, you know, she fucking. 
[03:05:30]  She literally avoids us now.  Well, how great is that?  What are you doing?  Do you understand how if you're a square guy that you can't even.  You know how great that is that you can fucking.  Like you don't even have to fucking tell me.  I know you can proposition women at least.  You can proposition them here.  At least I could.  Yeah.  Going.  Hey, hey, you put your fucking penthouse pet of the year.  You want to go out?  No.  Yes.  I could just walk up to her and say that. 
[03:06:00]  But in here, it's on the air.  I was like, all right, throw the phone.  She puts her fucking number in.  I call her back.  Imagine some guy at the office right now, some hot chick that just every day gives him  like a morning hello massage, like two squeezes on each shoulder.  And she's walking around and he's just like, I'm going to fuck your face off at lunchtime.  But he can't.  He's going to lose his job.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying?  And he's just sitting there and he's just in pain. 
[03:06:30]  A whole nother story here.  Yeah.  We got a, do we have the Lou Holtz audio?  A little taste?  Derek's looking for something in the other room.  It's a little taste.  He forgot to DVR it on Saturday.  Oh, really?  Do we have something on YouTube maybe?  We were looking, but we couldn't really find anything that was a good example.  There is some stuff, but nothing that's good enough.  I respect how he, I don't watch college game day because of him.  I can't.  You can't watch.  And it makes me mad because I'm like, no black squeaky voice motherfucking old raggedy 
[03:07:00]  man.  No Tuskegee air man.  Only nigga you see like that on TV is documentary niggas to tell you how there were niggas that  actually existed before niggas now.  Like, so.  If it wasn't fire star, we stopped on entire German Luftwaffe.  With all that, on the fire planes. 
[03:07:30]  And we used to have to maintain them all ourselves.  The Tuskegee Airmen.  Syphilis.  Yeah, they'd shut us up with the syphilis and see what would happen to the black man.  No fucking civil rights black men with a job.  Civil rights.  That talk like Lou Holtz.  Lou Holtz.  I'm telling you, you gotta hear Lou Holtz.  It's despicable.  I want to hear him so fucking bad right now.  Why would they keep that man on TV like that, man? 
[03:08:00]  Because he's a legend.  He's a legend, but it's despicable.  A white legend.  A white legend.  It was back in 1908.  And you sound like Lou Holtz.  Except for you have to do that.  Oh, does he whistle a little bit?  That's a mush mouse kind of.  Air's escaping.  Oh, my God.  What's that about?  Is that missing teeth?  What is that?  I don't know. 
[03:08:30]  I think it's his dentures coming out.  I can't believe you don't have any Lou Holtz, man.  We're trying.  Like I said, there's some, but I would rather pull a clip that would.  A real good one?  Yeah.  That would really bring it home.  It's college game.  There's no college game day on there.  And Mark May, he's like.  And Vinvi.  This is.  The black guy used to be a lineman for Pittsburgh, right?  And then, you know, South Carolina did the wrong thing there.  See, what they should have done here.  I mean, Alabama just doesn't do this.  And it's absolutely. 
[03:09:00]  I think Boise State should not.  It's just.  It's just wrong.  You know what?  Maybe we don't have Lou Holtz audio, but we got people that are way in.  Go ahead, Andrew.  Hi.  Yeah, my wife and I were watching on Saturday night, and they were talking about one of the football games.  And they were supposed to say a rough finish, but instead they said rough finish.  Rough fetish.  Rough fetish. 
[03:09:30]  Derek sent me a clip, so.  Is this one my work?  I think he's saying that this one's going to be good.  All right.  So let's give it a listen.  Okay.  Man, we're Boise State.  Not only have the blue kids.  Stop it.  Stop it now.  Do you understand?  Do you understand me?  He sounds like our old pal.  He sounds like he's got a fucking, like he's deaf. 
[03:10:00]  It's just not good.  And you know I'm in the dingus box, Boise State.  All right.  Let's try to get some of this.  Dr. Lou, Dr. Lou.  The doctor will see you now.  Man, we at Boise State not only have a blue field, we have a blue locker room floor.  And when Oregon State lives here, they're going to be black and blue.  As I told you before, people are motivated by their needs and discouraged by their fears.  We have no fear of any football team in this country who won't play anybody. 
[03:10:30]  But let me tell you the one thing that does scare me is the fact that people in the media  like Mark May and Lee Corso and Kirk Herndstreet say that we should be in a national championship  game even if we go undefeated.  But things like this that scare me, they're saying people can vote and breathe.  Not only vote in the football.  Stop it for a second.  This is what angers me about this situation.  Why?  Why is it angry?  It angers me.  It's the same thing of them forcing me to watch Muhammad Ali and the condition he's in 
[03:11:00]  and keep telling me that, oh, no, no, no, all his faculties are in the football.  Right, right, right.  But it's like, do you understand that I can't, don't force this man.  Doesn't that make it worse, by the way, that he does have everything?  But he has his faculty.  You can see he's a sharp old man, but he's just wet mouth.  Right.  Like it's just.  Shuffering, shuck it, Terry.  Boise State.  Sylvester Kent.  He's talking and trying to keep his teeth in his mouth at the same time. 
[03:11:30]  Back to it, all right.  Go to national elections, and it's obvious that their evaluation process is flawed.  Man, we have a great team.  We have no weakness.  Offense, defense, kick it.  We have a quarterback who's a Heisman candidate and kill him more.  And I have a dream.  Let me tell you what's going to happen when this year's over.  They're going to make a move of our team similar to Hoosiers,  where a small school beat the big one and won the championship.  But the difference is they didn't have to overcome all the hierarchy  that's trying to keep us out of that championship game. 
[03:12:00]  On my desk, I have a sign.  May God give me the courage to change the things I can,  the serenity to accept the things I can't,  and the wisdom to know the difference between the two.  I'll tell you one thing we can't change is everybody's mind about what a great football team we are.  Now, as I've told you all so, winners prepare and prevent.  Losers repair and repent.  We have prepared, and we are going to prevent anybody from keeping us in that championship game.  And, man, when you go out on that field, I want you to remember this, 
[03:12:30]  that we have to be an inspiration.  There's millions of people who are fighting an uphill struggle to accomplish something,  just like we're trying to get to that championship game.  And you remember Reese and Mark and Todd and Kirk and everybody else.  Let's go send a message to them.  Doctor!  Oh, my God.  Somebody should bring in, like, a little donut and just go,  Thank you.  Thank you, Dad.  Thank you.  Good boy.  Thank you. 
[03:13:00]  And there's your sugar.  Winners rule, losers are soon.  And that's why you've got to make sure you get out there and you win every tight game.  Go out and put your game faces on and pull out your umbrellas for this pep talk.  And you're states left even.  I'll kill the rabbit and make it look like an accident. 
[03:13:30]  He needs the Gallagher talk for the players when he talks to them.  Do you understand that...  Someone is saying that he sounds like Red Skelton.  A lot of Red Skelton's coming.  A little bit, yeah.  Do you understand that I watched Game Day to get all my scores and highlights?  And now I don't watch it anymore.  I have to watch ESPN News or whatever because they would have this...  I'm angry at the show.  It's too fucking distracting.  Why would they have this man on the show?  You can't watch the show and get any information because you're just thinking like... 
[03:14:00]  His pension has to be delicious.  Like because...  You know, he's putting so much work.  He has to...  He can't knead the dough.  And they can't look at him like, oh, Paul...  Get rid of this fucking guy.  Let's go to Anthony in Boston.  Anthony.  Oh, God.  Hey, guys.  I'm so happy you guys are talking about this right now.  I've been saying it for years.  Doesn't Lou Holtz sound like he needs that dentist sucker straw in his mouth at all times?  He's got to walk around with that little thing that sucks the saliva out.  Go ahead, Lou.  Very good.  Let's go ahead. 
[03:14:30]  Justin Jersey.  Hello?  What's up?  There's some great ones coming again.  It's so funny.  You've got to watch how Mark May just gets pissed off at him every time he talks because he makes no sense at all.  Mark May just wants to punch him in the mouth and he knows he just can't.  Yeah, he doesn't want to make it worse.  Yeah, and he's sitting there going, Mark May, I'm telling you, week after week, they do this thing where they debate.  Him and him debate an issue.  And Lou Holtz always wins because the guy who's the judge is always like, point for Lou. 
[03:15:00]  And he's like, I'm sorry.  And Mark May goes, and then the strategy.  And it's like, come on, man.  And then this fucker starts being an old man.  And Mark May punches shit because he's like, he wants to go, stop coddling this fucking elderly motherfuckies.  He's killing us.  There's a couple more coming in.  Mike in Chicago.  Mike.  Hey, guys.  Love you, Patrice, man. 
[03:15:30]  He sounds like a 90-year-old bullwinkle.  Fan mail from Chuck Flounder.  Say, Rock, watch me pull the rabbit out of my hat.  I mean, maybe it's cruel for me to say, but I'm saying I can't watch, I cannot watch my favorite college wrap-up show because of this.  By the way, that guy says Patrice rocks.  If you want to see Patrice this weekend, it's Bananas Comedy Club.  Poughkeepsie, New York. 
[03:16:00]  Two shows Friday, two shows Saturday.  You got the Big Mama Prods on Twitter and patriceoneal.com.  Ray on Long Island.  Ray?  Yeah, I'm on.  Hey, buddy.  Boo!  You can call him Ray.  You can call him Jim.  Oh, God, that fucking guy.  Hey, everybody.  The sheriff is in New York.  Yeah, the blazing saddles guy.  That's a good one, too, man.  No, Jared Blemett.  I said the sheriff is in New York. 
[03:16:30]  I'm in New York.  Boo!  That's him.  That's a good one.  That could be the best one.  That's him.  Ram him.  I didn't care to the sheriff is near.  I said the sheriff is in New York.  Boo!  Boo!  Oh, my God, man.  I mean, is that wrong to say fucking get rid of him?  This is why we're here. 
[03:17:00]  No one else is going to point this shit out out there.  Everyone's scared.  Everyone's scared of everything.  I mean, that was an audition.  It's not even a little bit.  Yeah.  It is over the top, man.  Let's go to Justin in Florida.  Justin.  Hey, guys.  So when Lou Holtz used to do College Game Day, and, you know, they do it outside where  all the kids and everybody makes big signs and holds them up, somebody right behind Lou  Holtz's head was holding up a giant sign, had a big picture of Lou Holtz's face, and  it said Lou Holtz for president. 
[03:17:30]  What a president.  What a president.  That's great.  Paul in Connecticut.  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  If you could pull a clip from that Stevie from East Town and Down.  Oh, that's similar, too.  Just like him, dude.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Very good.  Absolutely.  Let's go to Leonard in Atlanta.  Leonard.  Hey, listen.  He's got a brother.  Just punch in.  Cerebral Palsy Preacher.  You will get a laugh out of it. 
[03:18:00]  Believe me.  Cerebral Palsy Preacher.  Yeah, I think that's a good one.  And then you got people defending Lou Holtz.  He's a great coach.  He knows his shit.  I want to hear the people defending.  That's exactly what I was going to say.  There's a lot of them, though.  Shane, go ahead.  You're representing all the Lou Holtz fans.  Hey, well, I was born in 88 when Lou Holtz was in Notre Dame.  Uh-oh.  And I just want to say that he won a national title.  Have any of you guys ever won a national title before coaching college? 
[03:18:30]  Is this Lou Holtz?  It's Lou Holtz.  This is Lou Holtz on the phone.  Maybe it's his son.  He has the longest winning streak against USC.  11 straight in the season.  We didn't say he was a bad coach.  We said he's...  This has to be a bit.  We didn't say he was a bad coach.  I know.  This has to be.  Come on.  Listen, though.  This guy's hilarious.  Come on.  Listen, though.  This can't be real.  You know what you're going to do.  I mean, come on.  I'm saying he knows what he talks about. 
[03:19:00]  Come on.  Come on.  I want this to be real so bad, but I know it's not.  But he is good at being fake real.  Come on.  Shane.  He's good.  What else about Lou Holtz?  Well, he knows his commentary.  He knows what to say.  Oh, my God.  This guy's confusing me.  This guy can't be real.  Are you real?  I'm for real, yeah.  No.  Come on.  No way.  No.  Come on. 
[03:19:30]  I'm dead serious.  I just want to say frunkish.  Is there a frunkish coming, sir?  Frunkish.  Hello?  Yes?  Is there a frunkish coming or no?  Frunkish?  No.  That's all I'm going to say is that he knows what he's talking about.  He knows what he's talking about.  That's fucked up.  That is really fucked up.  I just want to, I really want to hear somebody defend that nonsense. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah.  All right, Shane.  Thank you.  Possibly.  Defend that.  Let me say out of Brett in Columbus.  Brett.  Hey, guys.  I'll tell you what.  First of all, that faggot-ass caller that just called in about the info.  Oh, God.  Just shoot me.  I just want to fucking, it's like that person that's sitting beside you.  You just want to fucking smash him.  I just want to hit Lou Holtz in the fucking face.  Oh, I don't know if we want that to happen, sir.  It doesn't have to be that.  I want to be able to enjoy his mush mouth for the next few years.  It frustrates you, dude.  Hey, mush mouth. 
[03:20:30]  It frustrates you.  You can't ignore it.  Yeah.  You can't fucking get away from it either.  It's like every time you turn on ESPN, he's doing fucking something.  And I'm like, God, shut the fuck up.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  The O.P. and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. </pre>
