<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, largely stemming from the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and interwoven with the hosts' typical brand of vulgar humor and celebrity gossip.  The show began with a discussion of the gas shortage following the storm. Opie reported minimal impact, while Anthony recounted his struggles, including considering bribery to obtain fuel and ultimately using a law enforcement contact. They categorized the public's experiences into three groups: unaffected, inconvenienced, and devastated, highlighting the disparity between those relatively unscathed and those facing severe hardship, particularly in areas like the Rockaways and Long Beach. A Homeland Security Federal Police Officer called in to provide a firsthand account of the Rockaways' situation.  The segment also touched on looting (or the lack thereof), the slow response of power companies like LIPA, food safety concerns due to power outages, and Anthony’s generator malfunction, all punctuated by numerous off-color jokes and observations about people's behavior in gas lines.

The conversation then shifted to the controversial cancellation of the New York City Marathon, fueled by audio clips of Mike Francesa’s furious rant criticizing the decision given the devastation in Staten Island and the perceived waste of resources.  Mary Wittenberg, head of the New York Road Runners, was heavily criticized for defending the marathon’s continuation, with the hosts employing highly offensive language.  This segment also included promotions for Jim Norton's stand-up shows, upcoming appearances by Jay Moores and Kevin Pollack, and anecdotes from Jim Norton (about Lars Ulrich) and Opie (about a 911 call).  Clips of Louis C.K.'s SNL appearance, Terry Bradshaw's controversial comment about Reggie Bush, and Ann Coulter discussing politically correct language were played, sparking a lengthy discussion on the evolving use of offensive words like "retard" and "faggot,"  including tangents on the N-word.  Promotional segments for Mike Tyson's new talk show and Chip Chipperson were also aired, along with a brief mention of Eddie Trunk’s Van Halen list.

A significant portion of the show focused on the debate surrounding Ann Coulter's use of the word "retard," featuring audio clips from Piers Morgan's interview with a person with Down syndrome.  The hosts and callers debated the word's offensiveness, expanding the discussion to broader issues of political correctness and the use of other slurs.  Jay Moore joined the studio, followed by Kevin Pollack, who promoted his book, "How I Spent My Way to the Middle," and shared anecdotes, including negative experiences with Eddie Vedder and Michael Clarke Duncan.  Pollack's appearance included impersonations and humorous exchanges, along with a played song (apparently a parody about a person with Down syndrome) and a clip from his podcast, "Talkin' Walkin'."  The segment concluded with further discussion and a caller’s comment whose son had a developmental disability.

A later segment focused on a podcast episode ("Talkin' Walkin'") with poor audio quality.  Despite the sound issues, the hosts decided to release it, featuring numerous celebrity impressions by a guest named Jimmy (including Christopher Walken, Jack Nicholson, Robert Shaw, Gary Sinise, and Nurse Ratched), Kevin Pollack (who contributed impressions and stories, including one about Jack Nicholson on the set of *A Few Good Men*), and other guests who contributed impressions and anecdotes. The conversation included graphic details about Chip Chipperson's cybersex website, vulgar and offensive humor about murder, AIDS, and sexual acts, interspersed with political commentary and promotion of Kevin Pollack's book and Chip Chipperson's website.

The final segment began with a discussion of Jay Moore's song "Habit" and sexually suggestive jokes about Chipper's mother. It transitioned to Anthony, the intern, detailing the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy in Staten Island, including incidents of criminals robbing firemen.  This sparked a discussion about under-reported crimes and the post-Sandy chaos, drawing comparisons to the 1920s and 1950s. The intern’s relatively small donation to relief efforts was then contrasted with his purchase of new bicycles and expensive audio equipment.  His perceived entitlement became a focal point of the discussion, involving criticism from the hosts and his own defense.  Nicole from the morning show joined, recounting her husband's "midnight raping" her, prompting further discussion about the event and concluding the broadcast.

[00:02:00]  Thank you. 
[00:02:30]  Thank you. 
[00:03:00]  Thank you. 
[00:03:30]  And this is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Never before has one radio show been so extreme.  So vulgar.  I'll fucking shove my face up a chick's ass in a second.  Someone said we curse a lot.  Do we?  I have no idea if we do.  So flatulent.  Who just farted?  I did, but I didn't know it stopped. 
[00:04:00]  Like rotten eggs and sewage.  Oh, wow.  Thank you.  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  This is not going to get any better than this.  Are we on the air?  No, we are.  Oh, okay.  Quite simply, the greatest show in the history of broadcasting.  Oh, and every day, that's what I say.  You guys are.  You guys having a good time or what?  Yeah!  Rules are destroyed. 
[00:04:30]  And convention burns the crowd.  Would you like to make some fucking second?  With Opie, the destroyer.  I would eat Petty White's ass.  She's 90, right?  It doesn't smell too bad.  Anthony.  The Rage.  Holy fuck, how much more fair you wanted.  Fire these people up my ass all the time trying to get me to help.  Fuck you.  And Jim Norton, lover of the transgender.  Every time a transsexual walks in the room, party horn should go off.  Surprise!  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[00:05:00]  Strap in, dicks.  This one's gonna hurt.  Double guns, bitch.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's do that.  Morning, everybody.  Hi.  Morning to everyone that has electricity.  That's true.  I don't think this show is that important to people where they're sitting in their car just listening to us.  No.  Oh, I guess you really can't because you can't waste your gas.  No, you can't waste the gas either.  So, eh.  So, good morning to everybody in the rest of the country. 
[00:05:30]  We did a whole week of radio last week and a bunch of people tweeting last night.  I can't wait to hear you guys.  It'll be the first time in a week.  I'm like, oh, my God.  You know what you missed?  Missed amazing material.  I guess you had more important things to do.  Bastards.  I'm down to 17 miles on my car.  That's what everyone's doing.  I got the countdown.  I can't sit.  I drove by the gas line last night for Hestina coming down 11th Avenue.  It wraps up like 44th and then wraps around the 10th. 
[00:06:00]  But it didn't look that.  It probably was about an hour and a half line maybe.  There's not a lot of gas stations on the island of Manhattan.  Or Long Island.  And that Hest station is one of them.  There's only a handful on Manhattan.  And they're way on the outskirts and not in easy places.  It's really boiled down to gasoline at this point.  It's all about the fuel.  It's like the road war.  Now you might understand why we do what we do in the Middle East.  We really can't fuck around with gas.  Exactly.  So we put up with a lot of horse shit. 
[00:06:30]  Put up a lot of shit.  Go in there and throw some bombs around when we need to.  Because I know a lot of people are like, woo.  You're like, well, you know, we need our gas.  So that's why we deal with their shit.  Unfortunately, they have it and we need it.  Because if they cut off the supply, guess what?  This is what happens.  This is such a small.  We're living it right now.  And it's such a small example of the nightmare that it could be.  But it's because people don't even like this.  And it's pretty much what's an inconvenience.  We're going to make, yeah, it's been a week. 
[00:07:00]  We'll go about 10 days.  And then I think everything will be more or less back to normal as far as the gas situation goes.  I think we got two or three days.  Well, the tankers have arrived.  So now it's all about trickling down to the gas stations.  Wait, the tankers?  What do you mean the boats or the big-ass tankers that bring the fuel in?  The ships and then the pipelines.  I guess one of the pipelines finally opened.  Yeah.  And then a lot of the, I guess, tanker trucks have to make their way out to the various gas stations.  I saw a couple last night.  Literally a couple. 
[00:07:30]  I saw two on the highways last night.  That's good.  Yeah.  Because I didn't see any.  I didn't see any.  I finally started seeing like a couple of them.  Are people just applauding them?  Yeah, they're following them.  Just follow it.  It's got to stop somewhere.  Right.  Yeah.  The gas situation is the big thing.  Out on Long Island.  I was talking with Opie before.  We were saying how this whole situation, there are three groups of people.  People that are completely unaffected by this.  I'll raise my hand. 
[00:08:00]  Opie falls in that category.  Can I, can I, because I ran into Russ Meneve, a comic, yesterday.  We were out just eating and wandering around.  He goes, hey man, how are you doing with the storm, you and your family?  Because he's not really sure where I live.  Right.  Tell you the truth, Russ, I wasn't affected at all.  And I kind of have like survivor guilt.  He goes, me too.  Isn't it weird?  He goes, my life hasn't changed a bit.  Not a bit.  And then we talk for another minute and he goes, anyway, I'm off to the gym.  See you later.  Yeah.  I'm one of those guys.  So I'm in category one.  Category one.  Me too. 
[00:08:30]  And then there's this middle range of various degrees of inconvenience to damage.  You know, things like that.  Like trees on houses.  Trees on your house.  Power gum, but you're not going to lose your house.  Right.  Power's out.  Gas is very, very low, so you're waiting in gas lines.  Right.  And that's about it, right?  Yeah, that's pretty much where I am.  And a horrendous commute.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Absolutely.  No.  I saw it.  Yeah, it's terrible.  And then there is complete and utter devastation.  That's the group three that we're all feeling really bad about. 
[00:09:00]  The people in Long Beach, the Rockaways, Breezy Point.  The Jersey Shore.  Jersey Shore.  All those people are completely devastated.  Like, they're looking at the rest of the world going, don't you realize I'm fucking, like, I'm on the moon here?  Right.  Can somebody do something?  Right.  I'm marooned.  Rockaway, they said, is a band.  Like, nobody's helping them.  Well, they don't know where to begin.  This was a motherfucker we were all learning as the days go by.  And the blame game is starting, and people are getting very pissed, and they're blaming the power companies, they're blaming the government, they're blaming FEMA. 
[00:09:30]  Even the mayor is getting shit because, obviously, Manhattan is getting its lights on very quickly, relatively speaking.  I don't know if it's quick.  But there's certain areas that don't have anything, and they're pretty pissed off.  Whether it's just emotional pissed off, or they actually have a reason.  I mean, you've got to realize, logistically, this is a fucking nightmare.  I had a couple of LIPA guys come to my house Saturday night. 
[00:10:00]  It was, like, three in the morning.  But I've been up.  Well, they knew you would be awake.  Exactly.  Exactly.  You're making it sound like that's outrageous.  They know that's when they should come a-knocking.  I sleep all day, and I've been up all night.  And I've been up all night.  Yeah.  Was it really them?  Like, those guys have been fake LIPA guys knocking on doors, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know.  I hope it was the fake LIPA guys.  Oh, please.  You'd have been reading about that in the paper.  Yeah.  Radio host raped with own pistol.  Yeah, is that finger getting a little itchier?  You know you could get some things done during this storm fucking- 
[00:10:30]  Well, Opie, I'm a responsible gun owner.  But the fingers get a little itchy, right?  I wouldn't call it itchy.  I would call it that I'm on a heightened state of alertness.  I love some of these people they've been interviewing on TV.  Like, I'll call them girls.  Not even, like, tough broads, just girls.  Yeah.  That if there wasn't a storm, they would just be kind of getting their nails done and shit.  And they're, like, on TV, like, we're protecting our homes from looters.  We will shoot any motherfucker that comes and tries to take our shit. 
[00:11:00]  Tough bitches.  A lot of people have become tough bitches.  Yeah.  Anyway, LIPA comes by at 3 a.m.  LIPA guys came by at, like, 3 in the morning.  I see their little-  I hear it on your door, and at 3 in the morning, you know, you're like, what the fuck?  And I see a little flashlight.  I just go to the door and stuff, and they got their whole LIPA gear on and everything,  and they were smiling.  And, oh, they were white.  So I assumed.  Yeah, so they knew who I was. 
[00:11:30]  And through one of the dispatchers that I know, they came over to explain the situation to me.  Oh, that's nice.  What the fuck the problem is.  Who are you that you gave an explanation?  Well, I'm Anthony, and I entertain you people.  They had to come by to give you an explanation.  Yeah.  That's awesome, actually.  Yeah, they came by and-  One of the perks of the jobs, people.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What'd they say?  That I'm truly fucked.  Really?  Yeah, they said a lot of the mains that are coming into my neighborhood, trees just repeatedly 
[00:12:00]  were falling down on these main lines.  And here's part of the problem that they said.  Actually, a couple of the guys blamed it on the Jews.  The Jews in my neighborhood, they come by to do maintenance.  Right.  And cut these trees down.  In my neighborhood, the parkway is kind of close.  And they don't want the trees cut down because they don't want to see or hear the parkway.  Right.  So it's kind of a barrier. 
[00:12:30]  And then when the storms come, they fall.  And that's where all the electrical lines are, too.  Sure.  So they just topple on top of these.  And that's the part of the parkway where they don't have lights, either.  Yeah, yeah.  Why is that?  The town was able to get that done?  Or the locals were able to get that done where there's no lights in that stretch of the parkway?  Yeah, yeah.  Because people don't want to be in the glow of the parkway from their homes.  So they came into my yard and I showed them.  They weren't even aware of my more localized problem, which is a snapped telephone pole between me and my backyard neighbor's property. 
[00:13:00]  Is it still there?  Yeah.  Just snapped?  Just snapped with a big, giant transformer on the snapped part on the ground with all the wires ripped out and a giant tree on top of all the wires.  So for them to coordinate tree removal and wires and everything, it's very difficult.  And what their goal is is to get as many people online as possible.  So to get a whole crew to put a pole in and get another fucking transformer up there for me isn't... 
[00:13:30]  So how long?  Saturday, they told me, four days.  Another four.  Yeah.  Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.  Just in time for a nor'easter that's going to punch us in the balls.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  We're going to get punched in the balls this week.  And my generator died on me Saturday.  So I had to get another generator.  What do you mean?  You burnt it out.  It just fucking went bubble.  I hope that happened. 
[00:14:00]  I hope that happened when you were doing something really important.  I really hope.  I really hope.  Well, the good thing is...  How did it sound when it stopped?  Well, that's the worst feeling ever.  Oh, and I heard it.  I heard it.  And did you try to start it up again?  Yes, of course.  And how does it sound when you start it up?  Oh, is that the worst?  Not even a fucking inkling that it was going to start. 
[00:14:30]  Not even a sound of hope?  Not even.  Remember the sound of hope?  You're like...  You're like, oh, okay.  Something's going on.  This might happen.  Just out.  Your generator got tired.  It got sleepy.  It laid down to rest.  It got sleepy.  So at that point, I had a full tank of gas.  Because if you recall, Friday, mine and Danny's drive back home, we went for it. 
[00:15:00]  We just went for the drive.  I had...  My low fuel light was on when we left the parking garage here.  And they said that's good for 30 miles.  Okay.  I was going to say maybe 20 even, because you got the big Escalade.  Yeah, yeah.  So I was driving very nicely like I never do.  Not getting the RPMs up.  And we realized, you know, we got out of the city real fast.  Like, we can make this.  So I made it to...  I made it home. 
[00:15:30]  Without gas.  Without getting gas.  Wow.  But the low range light came on at one point.  There's low fuel and then low range, which means you just don't have any gas left.  What does that mean?  Like, less than 10 miles?  Yeah, you're done.  You're just like five miles.  Wait, you don't have it where it tells you how many miles left?  Yeah, I have that.  But it was so low that it doesn't even tell you that anymore.  Oh, wow.  It just says low range and you're done.  Basically, it should just say you're fucked.  You're fucked.  So I popped some gas from the generator tank into my truck. 
[00:16:00]  It gave me under a quart of tank.  Right.  And went out venturing for gasoline at 3.30 in the morning, which I then found and waited  on a little line.  How long was the line?  Topped it off.  It wasn't bad at that point.  The station had just opened.  I just got lucky.  It was 106, 107 by Jericho Turnpike.  Right.  It swung a quick U-turn.  I was like, it was about 25 cars.  Damn.  But then by the time I got to the pump, it was way back, like even 3.30.  Really?  Yeah.  So I fueled up that.  My gas cans went back to the house. 
[00:16:30]  And yeah, again, the generator died.  So I had a voltage inverter that I plugged into my Escalade and left my Escalade idling in  my driveway for a day and a half.  And it didn't use that much gas.  How much did I lose in a day and a half?  Half a tank.  That's it.  That's it.  Wow.  Not too shabby.  But I was able to run two lights off of it and my computer, which I went on Hulu and  Netflix and stuff, so I was able to watch some stuff. 
[00:17:00]  But you've got a second place.  Stay in the city.  What are you doing?  I like being in my castle.  Yeah, good point.  You don't want to get robbed.  No, no, exactly.  So I was able to actually power up the alarms and everything and various locks.  You know how you were saying it's the tale of two cities?  Yeah.  On Friday, as you were doing all that, worrying about your gas, I'd go to my wife, hey, I'm  going to drive around and check out the city.  Just waste the gas.  Because for the people that don't know, Manhattan was cut in half for a while, where it was 
[00:17:30]  lights and no lights.  Like, this has never been seen before.  Did you see it dark?  I regretted not going down.  I saw it dark on Friday, and I was bummed that I didn't have my storm trooping buddy, Jim  Norton.  I would love to have gone storm trumping there.  Yeah, storm trumping.  It was very successful the first time we did.  I'm like, man, why is Jimmy in Minnesota when we could be driving around the city checking  shit out again?  So my wife goes, dude, do we have gas?  I go, oh, we got plenty.  It's the other side of this, though. 
[00:18:00]  Because I'm in a group text with my family.  Are you into the group text shit with your family yet?  Occasionally.  I'll get it at Don and Joe, but it's not that bad.  And then you feel like you have to write something, and they're all like, oh, God, there's a hole  in my roof, and we're freezing, and we're this and we're that, and I'm feeling guilty.  I'm like, well, I waited 20 extra minutes on the Starbucks line today, trying to throw  them something that makes sense.  Anyway, I drove around Manhattan, just fucking wasting gas, checking shit out. 
[00:18:30]  I went all the way to Battery Park, then to the east side.  I'm fucking doing all sorts of loops.  Why not?  How was it?  It was frightening, right?  Or creepy?  It was amazing.  I started when the sun was sort of starting to go down, made it to Battery Park, and there's  just hoses everywhere with water pouring out of them, because they're getting the water  out of the tunnels and stuff.  But they had that shit figured out.  I was telling Aunt, you go down a road, and all of a sudden, there's a bunch of hoses with  water just spilling out onto the street.  So I'm like, okay, they know that train somewhere.  They know where that's going. 
[00:19:00]  I would assume.  It all goes to the river eventually.  Or it would be a waste of time if it's just going back into the subway.  Yeah, yeah.  Into the subway.  Into the subway.  And then it would be normal.  Then you'd hit another road where there's a shitload of hoses and Con Ed people.  Is it Con Ed in the city?  Yeah.  Con Ed people all over the place.  And then I actually went through the West Village as it was getting dark.  And man, I'm like, why the fuck aren't people looting?  Why aren't they looting?  What has changed in society?  Because these stores, they're on roads where there's nobody around. 
[00:19:30]  I'm like, it would be so easy.  But no one was doing it.  And then you would see some of the stores downtown had big, huge, and it's what I saw,  big, huge black security guys just standing in front of some of these stores.  Yeah.  Looking really intimidating.  Just standing there, you know, just in case.  They obviously were hired by the people that could afford something like that.  And then as I was driving, they turned on some of the lights on the Lower East Side.  Oh, you saw them flip on? 
[00:20:00]  Pretty much.  I was driving down one road and it was all, that was the craziest thing about driving around Manhattan.  There were no lights.  So I'm just going.  I'm just going.  But people are just going the other way.  Oh, man.  And they don't have, they didn't have cops on every corner.  Game of chance right there.  Pretty much a game of chance.  But, man, you could get downtown in minutes, which was kind of fun.  Oh, yeah.  And then I was on Canal.  I think it was Canal.  I was on Canal and it was like no lights for about 10 lights in a row.  And then up ahead, boom, lights.  They just turned it on, that part of the city. 
[00:20:30]  But it was awesome to check out.  But I'm just wasting gas.  Oh, other people are just fucking dying for gasoline.  And then I got home and I still got three quarters of a tank.  So I might go out for another spin today because I got the resources.  Hey, I was thinking, you know what's a good way for people to make money, too?  Because I don't want to wait in a gas line.  Yeah.  Because I would pay somebody to wait in a line.  That was what I was thinking of doing yesterday.  I was going to, I was going to, here was my plan before I had an alternate plan.  To take all my little gas jugs, go out, find like a guy that's in the demo with a pickup truck or something. 
[00:21:00]  Right.  And pull up next to him, that's close to the front of the line, and say, dude, I'll give you, you know, money.  Just take my gas cans and fill them up and, you know.  Wow, that's, that would be a hell of a service for people.  Why would he give them back to you?  He'll probably keep them.  Well, that's what I started thinking, like, eh, if that happens.  But I would have gotten his plate before, you know, some of he zooms off, I'll send somebody to kill him.  But in this disaster, when people are like, it's anarchy in Queens, are you going to call and go, some man took my gas? 
[00:21:30]  Took my gas.  I know, that's just it.  Well, I didn't do that.  I did wait in a line with real people at a real gas station with the gas jugs.  I had three five-gallon gas jugs, and I was on a line that was, it was about an hour-long wait.  Standing?  And standing, and it was a bunch of guys, you know, regular working joes.  So we were yapping and making fun of the people that were pulling up to the gas pumps, and I'll talk about it a little later.  You told me a different story before the show today.  Oh, well, that was last night. 
[00:22:00]  Because every day is a new adventure on how to get gas.  It's like the Road Warrior.  That story you just told actually happened?  Yes.  Okay, because you did tell me a different story.  No, no, no.  Hold on, really fast?  I'll tell you that one, yeah.  Because people are getting pissed, because, look, we're doing the best we can.  This guy's like, hey, I'm a Homeland Security Federal Police Officer.  I'm helping out on the Rockways.  There are people down there.  All right.  All right, hello?  Who said that was?  Oh, you want to actually talk to him?  I thought that was him.  I thought he was him.  Okay.  Gee. 
[00:22:30]  Sir.  Hey, buddy.  I think our point is that everyone has spread pretty thin.  I would assume there's people in all the affected areas by now.  No, there definitely is.  There's three FEMA disaster recovery centers set up in the Rockaways, and they're actually going pretty well.  No one's really looting.  No one's rioting.  It seems to be plenty of supplies.  It's just people don't understand.  It takes a little bit for, you know, it's a logistical nightmare.  It takes a while for everybody to get in place.  There's one set up at Cycle Park in Brooklyn. 
[00:23:00]  I'm sorry?  No, I was saying, of course.  It takes some time.  Yeah, and they've officially set up their main headquarters in Queens, so everything's rolling.  What is the best way to give money that you know is going to get to the people?  Like, I worry about charities.  I don't trust them, so I haven't given anything, because I just, I always think these charities fucking...  You had to watch the super concert that was on TV Friday.  Quick text, ten bucks.  Yeah, the problem is that people show up to these FEMA sites thinking that there's just stacks of cash waiting for them, and there's not. 
[00:23:30]  Right.  But it's actually, it's a long process, and if you guys, if you get the chance to go down to the Rockaways, it's, the news doesn't do it justice.  I mean, it is just absolutely disgusting.  I would, how do we get there today?  I'll go there today and sweep up a little.  I'll do a little sweeping.  Take the Bell Park way to 11 South.  I don't know if I have enough gas.  You were driving around.  I wasted a quarter.  I wasted a quarter.  You don't want to get too far from downtown.  I got three quarters left. 
[00:24:00]  Can I get to the Rockaways and back, do some sweeping?  Yeah, sure.  All right, I'll go sweeping.  Yeah, but I want to give money.  I just don't know where.  The Red Cross, are they like, I mean, I know they're legit, but does the money go where you want it to go?  Because with charities, there's all this nonsense that happens.  There's always...  I don't...  I don't...  The Red Cross, I don't really...  Get some money where you're just done with these people, right?  I don't see where that money really goes.  Yeah, I want to give it, but...  Yeah, that's always the question whenever this shit hits.  Yeah, it freaks me out.  Then you find out, well, you donate it to whatever. 
[00:24:30]  I'm not even going to name anybody.  And then you learn, like, months later that it just kind of sat there because there's all sorts of red tape before the money starts moving to the people that need it.  So, I don't know.  I don't know how that shit works.  What's kind of impressive about the sanitation department and everybody is that they are immediately cleaning up the Rockaways.  I was there starting Monday night when, you know, a large section of buildings were on fire because of a gas line.  Just the cleanup that they've done in just a week is remarkable. 
[00:25:00]  It really is.  Right on, brother.  All right.  All right.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  You take it easy.  All right.  Enjoy your power.  Yes.  Thanks, buddy.  I do feel bad we have power.  My brother's restaurant, F.A. Trials, which I talk about a lot on the show, he had to throw away everything.  Of course, yeah.  He's figuring he lost 20 to 30 Gs.  Jeez.  And then Ant goes, is that covered by insurance?  I don't even know.  I don't even know how that works.  I wonder.  They have to have some kind of storm insurance at a restaurant.  He had to throw everything, you know, everything away. 
[00:25:30]  Even the chairs?  I don't want these.  Empties the place, the ovens.  He didn't explain the storm damage itself.  I'm not really sure, you know, what happened in the village of Huntington, but he had to  throw all his food away and start over.  If you're eating off of any of those fucking street carts in the city, you're crazy.  Ready for this?  Yeah.  I had a burger yesterday from a place in our neighborhood, and obviously these restaurants  weren't getting their regular deliveries.  I had about four bites of this burger, and I went, this meat's bad. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  And sure enough, three, four hours later, you know, I don't even have to tell you what was  happening.  I got a quick fucking bout of food poisoning.  You want the gyro?  I sell you the gyro.  The lamb is just fucking rotting.  Well, this was a restaurant in the neighborhood, because I think people are making judgment calls.  Like, I just told you, my brother said, fuck, I didn't want to throw $20,000 worth of shit  away, but he did.  But I'm sure some of these restaurants are like kind of doing this, like, I think we might 
[00:26:30]  be able to push this forward a little bit.  That's good.  It doesn't look that bad.  Yeah.  And I got hit with something yesterday, man.  And then I told my wife, I'm like, why are we ordering out?  We got to wait a little while.  Crazy.  Because people aren't really getting their deliveries yet.  Do you know what you're right?  Their regular deliveries.  I'm so dumb.  This is what I did last night.  I ordered Chinese food last night.  Oh, boy.  From a place up the street from us.  But I got the chicken and broccoli.  I got no rice.  I don't know why I'm telling you that.  But the chicken, like, why would I order chicken?  That was stupid.  Oh, my God.  It's not really stupid, because, you know, with the flooding, all the rats came above 
[00:27:00]  ground.  Oh, yeah.  They could cook those right up.  The Chinese people, abso-fucking-lutely.  Dogs, cats, rats.  Are in heaven right now.  Whatever you need.  Look, man.  I'll say it again.  I've told this story 20 times, and I want to tell it another 20 times.  When I was living in Northport, there was a Chinese restaurant.  It's long gone now.  I sat there and ate some kind of chicken dish, and I know, I have no doubt in my mind I wasn't  eating chicken.  There's no fucking doubt in my mind.  It was so gamey.  I ate half of it before I realized, this is not chicken, and threw it away. 
[00:27:30]  And then you've got to wonder what the fuck it was.  I don't know what it was, but I know that it wasn't chicken.  I just know.  Because when you talk about this with Chinese restaurants and stuff, they come out of the  woodwork.  But I'm telling you, I had an experience where I knew I was eating something I never ate  before.  There's no doubt in my fucking mind.  And that place closed down, because I think they were probably getting a little desperate  and cutting some corners, and people stopped going there.  The gas situation is one of the biggest problems. 
[00:28:00]  Like, aside from people that completely lost their houses, the next biggest problem is  this fucking petroleum situation.  It's, every day has been, where can I get gas?  It's like drugs.  It's like fucking, it's like when you do coke, all you want is more coke.  And all you're thinking about is, where can I get more cocaine?  Well, with the gas, you get some gas, you like, feel good, because you got a lot of 
[00:28:30]  gas.  Right.  And then you'll be using it.  And then you start looking, oh shit, it's getting low.  Oh fuck, where am I going to get my next fucking fix of gas?  And then you got to go out and try to find it.  And you either score, or you don't.  And like I said, you know, I went out three in the morning, and then the next day I stood  in a line, and then the next day, you know, is something else.  But it's constantly trying to find gasoline.  You got to just find the drug dealer himself.  Right.  Because it's all like, oh, I know a guy. 
[00:29:00]  I know a guy.  This guy, if we go over here, he's going to, you know, show us the way to the gas station.  Yeah.  Well, last night I got a fucking, that was the shit right there.  What'd you do?  You found the drug dealer?  I found the fucking source.  You found the gas source?  I was on Twitter, and I got a little...  People hate when we tell the shit.  A little tweet?  Well, it happens.  I'm going to tell you right.  But, I don't know.  Everyone's got to do what they got to do.  This is, here's, I just want to explain something before.  I'm actually protecting you.  Oh, I know.  Because what you're about to say is going to piss off people. 
[00:29:30]  Fuck them.  But it is our lives.  Fuck them.  It is our lives.  Every once in a while, someone fucking, you know.  Because here's the deal.  Contacts us and takes care of us.  Here's the fucking deal.  I've seen so many people on the news, and you can understand.  They're fucked up.  Everything's gone.  And then there's this other group of people that I see as not being able to fucking take  care of themselves.  They're not clever, cunning, using whatever resources you can, whether it's people you  know or places that you have access to. 
[00:30:00]  Just things.  They expect this government to swoop in and take care of them the second a disaster happens.  You know what?  You're on your fucking own for at least a while.  And instead of getting in front of a camera and bitching about it, do anything to help  your fucking situation out.  Yes.  Siphoning.  You know what?  I'm not going to tell anyone what to do or not do in that situation.  There's a giant risk with that.  You get your fucking ass beat. 
[00:30:30]  You get arrested.  But if that's the route you want to take to take care of yourself, you know, you might  have to do that.  It gets to that point.  Now, I did a few things.  I went out late at night, figured that was the good thing to do.  With very little gas, I was like past the point of no return.  You're wheeling and dealing.  Yeah, and then-  Is it kind of scary to leave your driveway knowing that-  Knowing that you might not have enough gas to get back when you're finally gone.  How is that feeling?  It's the point of no return, my friend.  I bring it up because I don't think any of us around our age, 40s, know that feeling. 
[00:31:00]  Where you actually could run out of gas.  Run out of gas.  And a lot of people are going through that right now.  They pull out of that driveway and they just wave goodbye to their family like, wish me luck.  Yeah, I've seen a bunch of cars on the side of the road.  They're out of gas fucking cars.  They just ran out.  Wow.  So yeah, so I did that.  And then I waited on a line like everybody else.  I did that because that was that day, that was the only way for me to get gas. 
[00:31:30]  But that's, I realized that and that's what I did.  And then last night on Twitter, I get a tweet from a gentleman.  Gotta love the New York State Police.  Thank you.  I work in security details at gas stations.  Keep the riffraff from beating each other up on these long lines.  Well, they need a place to gas up.  And they need a place so they can do their jobs.  They have a certain pump that's allocated for law enforcement.  God, I had no idea this was going on.  That's cool.  And I was able to wheel in and fill my vehicle. 
[00:32:00]  It was a 30-mile drive from my house, so it wasn't like it was right around the corner.  People have been driving to Connecticut from where?  I understand.  No, but driving to Connecticut from the city is just about 30 miles, too.  Yeah.  So it wasn't a fast drive.  Because I've heard those people.  I drove all the way to Connecticut.  I drove all the way down to Philly.  I drove, you know.  Yeah, we drove to southern Jersey.  Yeah.  No, I drove out like about 30 miles or so and gassed up everything. 
[00:32:30]  My gas cans, my fucking truck.  I topped it off where it was dribbling out of the fucking nozzle.  Oh, wow.  And then drove back home and I had all my shit.  Were you singing a happy tune on the way home?  I felt good because I had my shit.  I was very happy.  But here's the deal.  Right.  Now, tomorrow, the next day, because I'm going to be without power for a couple of days,  that shit runs out.  And now I've got to figure out how to get more gas.  Get you back?  Probably not.  You know, it was a one-time deal. 
[00:33:00]  He was there at that station.  They don't put him at the same place all the time.  So that worked for last night.  So now you've got to figure out for the next time how it's going to work out.  Exactly.  And this is how it's been the entire fucking week.  Now, we're a week into the storm.  They're saying that gas would be back to normal more or less in another, I think, three days,  they said.  Yeah.  How close were we to complete anarchy for real?  It was.  How close?  It's going to be about 10 days.  Yeah.  We made it to 10 days.  But what happens if it goes another week without gas? 
[00:33:30]  I know.  How crazy.  What ends up happening then?  This is like real-life SimCity.  What's the next step?  Much more angry people.  But what breaks down at that point?  If it was another week where you really couldn't get gas?  Theft, siphoning, fucking carjackings, things like that.  Maybe not carjacking, but more sneaky shit, probably.  Sneaky shit at first.  Like siphoning would probably be a big deal.  Then it just gets crazy.  Oh, here's another thing I realized while waiting on the line. 
[00:34:00]  There's the pull-up-with-your-car line.  Right.  And then there was this come-in-with-your-gas-jug line.  Right.  So I went in with the come-in-with-your-gas-jug line on Saturday.  That's the only option I had.  And there were a bunch of working guys online.  It was kind of, you know, it took about an hour, which isn't bad.  It was kind of cool talking with those guys.  You know, the old job site kind of guys.  Very cool.  But we saw how fucking stupid people are and why these gas lines move so slowly. 
[00:34:30]  Every fifth car or so, someone pulls a bonehead fucking move, and you just want to fucking yell at them.  What's the move?  There were a shitload of things going on.  There's people that don't know how to pull around another car if the pump opens in front of a car.  Right.  You got four pumps, right?  Right, right, right.  And they don't know how to just go around.  So there's an empty pump.  Right.  So that's holding up the line.  There's other people that don't know that the gas nozzle will reach the other side of your fucking vehicle.  Right.  So you don't all have to wait on one side of the pumps. 
[00:35:00]  Why can't we get a guy at the gas station taking care of all that?  Well, if they spoke English, that would be wonderful.  And they're just idiots.  They don't even know.  The people that were standing on the gas jug line were directing traffic and telling people,  no, come up this way.  And then the epitome of I couldn't figure out what the fuck was going on.  A guy pulls up in a Mercedes, and he's at the first pump.  And there's a guy behind him at the other pump and next to him at the other two on the other side. 
[00:35:30]  His car fucking conks out right there at the pump.  There's four pumps.  It's 25% of your fucking output is now blocked by this guy.  The gas station guy comes out with this battery pack and jumper cables lifting the hood.  They're futzing.  They're fucking trying to start.  It's not starting.  Everyone's just saying, push the fucking thing out of the way.  Of course.  They wouldn't push this fucking thing out of the way.  What was that?  Why?  Because they're idiots.  There was no reason for it. 
[00:36:00]  And then we were actually saying, well, if you're not going to push him out of the way,  can we go over there with the jugs and fill up because no cars are going by there?  No.  That's the jug line.  That's the jug.  Yeah, but you're wasting a whole pump there.  Jug line.  That's the jug line.  They all become the soup Nazis.  You fucking idiot.  Do you hate them?  I wanted to douse them in whatever gas I had and throw a match.  They all become the soup Nazi.  They are idiots.  I can't stand them.  So, yeah, and then this woman blocks the gas line. 
[00:36:30]  She's at the end again.  Right.  And this car's behind him with a couple of girls in it.  And they're like, could you move?  And she goes, I'm waiting for my change.  You don't wait for your change on the fucking line.  You move forward.  That's the me, me, me mentality that everyone has.  She couldn't fathom why the car behind her that wanted to wait for gas was pissed. 
[00:37:00]  She's gassed up, and she's good.  She's going to wait for her change.  She had to wait for fucking change.  Well, we've all been waiting four years, right?  Yeah.  Wait a little longer.  Has anybody pulled the move that people put?  I think it's murderable when you're on line to merge off an exit, and that scumbag that  pulls up to the very end and jumps in front of everybody.  And I also hate the person that lets them in.  I'm like, don't let them in.  Yeah.  If I catch Kenny doing that, I yell at him.  You know what?  I'm a don't let them in guy. 
[00:37:30]  Never.  There's so many let them in people.  Here's what I do.  Like when you're merging and all that, I'm like, no, you don't let someone that just pulled  up at the last second selfish.  There's a way to do this.  You don't understand.  Here's what you do.  I do it all the time.  Because people are stupid and unattentive, and I take advantage of it.  I'll fly.  I'll fly.  I won't stop and wait to get in, because that pisses people off.  I will fly.  And the second traffic starts moving, you've got to look way ahead.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And when you see someone fucking slipping, you slide right in. 
[00:38:00]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I'm guilty of cutting in, but I'm not going to let anyone else cut in.  Exactly.  That's how it works.  And I'm not going to do the slow creep in.  Has there been anybody doing that at the gas lines?  No, they will kill people for that.  And it moves so slow, there's no one going to get in front of you.  All the news coverage, it's very obvious that it's going to get ugly on those gas lines.  Oh, so then there was a little drama at the jug line.  I was about ten people back with my little jugs and waiting for the gas pump to open up. 
[00:38:30]  And then the guy came over and finally did allow some of the jug people to use that gas pump,  but for only credit card people.  So he goes, anyone with credit card want to get gas?  And I'm like, yep.  I pick up my jugs and I start walking.  And I walk over to the pump.  And now I'm getting ready to pump my gas.  And this guy comes walking over with his ugly, dumb fuck wife.  And he's like, I was ahead of you on that line when he asked for the credit card thing. 
[00:39:00]  I go, yeah, I don't care.  He said, who wants fucking gas for credit card?  I have my credit card.  I moved.  I go, where were you?  I go, that's why everyone's waiting.  I heard and I went.  I go, I heard and I went.  Like Ralph Cramden.  He was looking at me horrified.  He was so pissed at me.  But it's like, he literally showed up a minute after I started pumping my gas and said,  what, I was first.  No, you weren't.  It's quite the scene out there.  It's pandemonium. 
[00:39:30]  I have a brother who doesn't have electricity in northern Jersey with three small kids, eight and down.  Hole in the roof, huge tree hit his house.  He's without power.  He got a tree on his house?  He's got a tree on his house.  A lot of people got that tree on their house.  I got a tree on my house.  I got a tree on my house.  What a fucking premonition.  Oops.  What a fucking.  Oops.  Yeah.  Oh, it was all fun and games.  I wonder how many.  When you were playing it, wasn't it?  I wonder how many people laughed at that clip over and over again and have an actual tree 
[00:40:00]  on their house now.  I don't even want to imagine.  It used to be real funny for everyone, wasn't it?  But it's like that, how you were talking about gas, you figure out how much gas you got  and what you could do that day.  Right.  My brother is in a cold house.  And I'm like, I never lost power and I got plenty of room.  Come on by.  We've been trying to figure this out since last Thursday.  Yeah.  And he can't fill up.  Because then he's like, well, if I get gas, then I'll be there for the weekend.  Yeah.  Turns out he can't really fill up. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  So he has to stay in his cold house instead of coming and staying with me.  But then I'm like, look, I got three quarters of a tank.  I've wasted a quarter on Friday.  But I said, if you could get to the city, then take my car back.  I don't care.  But it's that negotiating that you were talking about.  Like, all right, what can I do with this?  So he had to choose, I have to stay in a cold house because I don't know if I'm going  to be able to fill up.  Dude, it's the constant thing that's on your mind now in this situation is fuel.  That's all I've had in the back of my mind, like this pressing issue. 
[00:41:00]  Are you dreaming of fuel?  How much do I have?  Where do I get the next batch?  I have this much, but I need to do this, this.  All right, how many days are left?  When will this up?  It's crazy.  In the middle of raping bitches in your dreams, are you dreaming of gas?  Fucking during dream rape, all of a sudden, I'm at a gas station and it fucks the whole  thing up.  I'm waiting on line.  In between the rapes?  Yeah.  I see girls.  I could be dream raping and I have to wait on a gas line.  Are you dream raping the girls that are online to get gas in your dreams?  No, I can't dream rape because I'm waiting on a gas line. 
[00:41:30]  It's terrible.  You can't multitask in your dreams?  No.  You can't wait for gas and dream rape?  Well, the money shot is when I finally put the nozzle on my escalator, it turns into  a chick's asshole.  Wouldn't it be great if you went back over Scott Shannon's audio for the last 15 years  and the week of every tragedy, he had a weird permanent, like a 9-7 of all one, he went  like, you know, I got a plane in my building, and in Pan Am, Lockerbie, I got a body in  my yard.  Like, if you look back, you're like, oh my God, this guy is cold. 
[00:42:00]  He knew everything.  That stupid rock head is a seer.  He's a seer.  He's a seer.  I got a shooter in my, well, fuck.  I got a gun in my knoll.  I got a shuttle in my ocean.  He just knows everything.  He's been doing it for 50 years and never put the pieces together.  Bastard.  Stupid ass.  Some guy, he went away, couldn't wait any longer.  He said that he, someone took 100 gallons from his truck. 
[00:42:30]  Wow.  Ah, yeah, some thievery going on.  And a lot of price gouging.  Is the price gouging happening?  Well, not at the gas station, but there are people selling gas for $25 a gallon on Craigslist  and stuff.  Wow.  I got my generator off of Craigslist, and it was a pretty good deal.  The guy, this guy.  Your new one?  Yeah.  Oh, because all the stores are out.  All the stores are out.  This guy showed up.  Because I'm like, why would you deal with Craigslist?  Craigslist.  It was pretty cool.  Brand new.  Right?  It's still in the box. 
[00:43:00]  This guy, he finally came to the house, and I think he turned out to be a fan because he  was very friendly, and his friend came out of the truck with smiles and stuff.  Yeah.  He was all smiley.  You know that smiley face you get?  That's the worst.  Hey!  That's the worst of the over-the-top smiley face.  I know.  Smiley face guy.  That must be nice.  Although, at the cell last time, I got Starer.  Oh, no.  I'm eating, and he walks over, and he puts his hand, and he goes, hi, I'm a big fan.  And I'm like, thanks, end of talk radio. 
[00:43:30]  Yeah.  You dead fucker.  And then you get sweaty palm guy.  Ah, there's just a multitude of...  Staring guy is pretty good, too.  He was nice.  Smiley guy.  So, smiley guy...  Smiley guy dropped off the generator.  It was him and his smiley friend.  But he was saying, he drove up to Maine with a truck and bought a fuckload of generators  to bring down.  Smart.  And he wasn't making, like, he wasn't fucking doubling the price of these things or anything.  Getting some pocket money, man.  He was making a few bucks.  You know, he was performing a service, because there weren't any fucking generators, so I 
[00:44:00]  had no qualms with what this guy was doing.  He said, though, he said he went to Lowe's, and there was a pile of fucking new generators  that were on the side of the building.  And he asked the guy, he goes, what the fuck is that?  Like, why aren't...  You know, you don't have any generators, but he goes, yeah, those are people that brought  them back because they didn't put oil in them.  There were a fuckload of people that just buy generators, pour gasoline in, start them,  and blow the fucking motors because they don't put oil in them. 
[00:44:30]  Well, most people don't know how to work a generator.  No, they know nothing.  They never had to work a generator.  So they don't put one quart of oil in, and it just fucking blows them up, and they were  just a bunch of dead generators.  So, yeah, so that was cool.  I got that off Craigslist.  How much should it have cost?  What percent did it jack up the price?  Which is probably not that bad.  It was probably a, man, maybe a $600 generator, and he sold it to me and delivered it for  $850.  Oh, that's fine. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, that's, you know.  I guess that's nothing.  People always try to find a way to make money through something like this, and I don't think  there's anything wrong with it.  I mean, the price, I mean, the price, price gouging is another thing, but I mean, people  that get smart and go, wait, all these people need generators?  I'll take a fucking trip to me and come back with a whole fucking truckload.  Let me go to Chris in Jersey really fast.  Chris, go ahead.  You know the amazing psychological phenomenon going on here is when my power was out, I  was fucking calling PSE and G and bitching and moaning, and, Opie, I heard the story  of your brother, and I could give less than a fuck. 
[00:45:30]  I got my power back on last night.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, yeah.  But that's how people are.  That's it.  I got my power.  You've joined the haves.  Welcome to the haves.  I got mine.  I got mine.  Yeah, that's it.  You're right, though, man.  You're right.  I got mines.  I gots mines.  Well, wow, there you already got the traffic is a motherfucker.  Yeah, it's crazy already coming in.  God, this just continues a week later.  It really is fucking crazy.  The heat's another thing.  Okay, it was fucking cold last night. 
[00:46:00]  It's getting a little chilly out there, and I don't have heat.  I have oil-fired heat, and, you know.  How cold was it?  Were you, like, chilly?  I was a little chilly.  Oh, I had the AC on last night because my building, you know, everyone turns their heat on.  Sure, it gets a little warm, I bet.  It gets a little warm.  Everyone's heat rises, so I actually don't have to turn my heat on ever.  Yeah.  And it was so hot last night, we actually went to bed with the AC on.  Oh, that's nice.  And the window opened a little bit.  Right.  Just to try to cool down the apartment. 
[00:46:30]  I went through six boxes of six-a-piece Dora Flame logs in my fireplace.  I bet you didn't get any Javalog jokes on your Twitter.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  No one sent that.  Why didn't you have a scoping for a Javalog?  Yes, because he did that one time.  He did that one time.  Do you remember?  I do, and I'm the only one that does, right?  500 fucking Javalog tweets later.  By the way, I love everyone.  I'm just fucking making jokes.  Of course.  Love y'all.  Love y'all. 
[00:47:00]  So the Dora Flame, and then I get people going, what's the matter, not enough wood fell outside  to fucking put in your fireplace, faggot?  Why don't you get...  Oh, I saw that tweet.  And I'm like, hey, tell me.  Do people understand green wood?  First of all, green wood.  Secondly, I'm not fucking honest Abe Lincoln with my fucking axe out there splitting logs.  You're not even honest, Anthony Comey.  No.  I have nothing in common with Abe Lincoln.  Believe me.  So you will not... 
[00:47:30]  Hopefully soon you will, though.  It's time to go to the movies.  So I guess you won't be seeing that new movie, huh?  It looks terrific.  Well, maybe.  I used to love chopping wood back in the day.  Yeah, it's cool and shit, but...  Until you get a log to your fucking forehead.  Yeah.  Because you put it and try to split it in half with one good chop down the middle.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  And that thing starts flying toward your head.  And the thing is, you know, you get a fucking wood splitter for one day.  You could just crank out cords of wood. 
[00:48:00]  So I could sit there paw angle style swinging an axe.  Why?  I kind of like it.  I don't know.  If you're looking for a quantity of wood.  Yeah.  If you're just looking to, you know, fucking get a little workout, then sure.  But it's all green wood.  It's not going to burn, you dummies.  Next year, there's going to be a fuckload of wood.  Boy, next year you'll be able to get a cheap cord of wood.  That's for sure.  Yeah.  But this was all Duraflame.  And it heats up probably a five-foot radius from my fireplace. 
[00:48:30]  I know.  That's it.  You got to get a wood-burning stove.  So, yeah, let me put that in my house.  Why not?  Yeah, why?  Wood-burning stoves are awesome.  Well, I'm certainly getting this big generator.  Although it dries the fuck out of your skin.  You feel very, like, dehydrated.  Nostrils.  Oh, yeah.  And I've been sleeping on the couch.  I haven't slept in my bed since this happened.  Why?  Because all the electric's downstairs, the TV's downstairs, and the fireplace's downstairs.  I like a nice cold room.  You should be up in that dark, cold room.  No! 
[00:49:00]  Like a mausoleum.  You just got to be watching that front door.  I got that TV on.  I got my fucking front and back door there.  I'm ready to rock and roll.  You're in a good spot.  I got the fucking beers outside my slider.  My whole fucking schedule was so screwy.  I've had Travis and his wife and little Riley staying at the house, and my hours, I don't  know what they think, because I sleep all day long, probably 7.30 p.m. I'll wake up, 
[00:49:30]  and then I'll just be up until the morning.  How do you do that?  Because I'm up.  I see.  It's amazing.  I'll wake up at 6 in the morning on weekends.  No exaggeration.  6 is pretty much my limit.  And I see you still tweeting.  I almost want to write you and go, tag.  I'll take it from here.  Take it from here.  I'm going to sleep.  But I would love to stay up all night on the weekends, but my schedule is such that  I kind of keep the same schedule that we have during the week.  Yeah, I can't do that.  But you're able to flip the whole fucking thing. 
[00:50:00]  I don't know how you do that.  In a day.  It's crazy.  Because I'm struggling to keep my eyes open at 9, 30, 10 o'clock on a Friday night.  Of course I want to stay up later.  It's all about the napping, when you fucking take a nap, and shit like that.  Then you can flip like that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's what I've been doing.  And it's so funny, because these guys, Travis and his wife and everything, they're just seeing  me sleep on the couch constantly.  Because they go to bed, and that's when I'm awake.  And then I'm watching TV. 
[00:50:30]  Well, they'll get up, and sometimes I'm still awake.  Travis, what time do you go to bed on a weeknight?  On a regular weeknight?  No, 10 o'clock.  Watching Travis go beddy by time was hilarious.  He's like, I got to bed.  I just woke up.  Yeah.  What the fuck are you doing?  You have no one to play with.  Yeah.  You have no one to play with.  Trust me.  He had someone to play with.  Oh, little Riley's adorable.  She's taking quite a liking.  She's so friggin' hysterical.  She's adorable, cute, and just like, I don't understand how kids figure out shit to say 
[00:51:00]  that just cracks you up.  What are you talking?  You're a poopy head.  You're a stiff.  She got Marion comebacks.  I go, oh, look.  She's upstairs, and she's by the railing, and she's like holding on to the wood slats in  the railing upstairs.  And I go, oh, look.  You're in jail.  You're in jail.  And I'll just go, oh, good one.  Good one.  You got me. 
[00:51:30]  Do you really do that?  Good one.  Yeah.  Good one.  Well, from her point of view, you are.  She's looking through the bars at you.  That's what she's thinking.  Hey, don't give her that much credit.  That's what it is.  It's crazy.  Wouldn't it be funny if she said, you know, Anthony, the problem is we both have the same  perception.  Oh.  I'd be like, wow, that's pretty good.  You're smarter than daddy.  I got to go make pee-pees.  Aw.  Badly.  Aw.  We got a busy show today.  Jay Moores is coming in.  What time is Jay in?  I didn't know he was here today.  He should be in in half an hour or so.  And Kevin Pollack, so, wow, two guys that know how to do walking. 
[00:52:00]  And Jimmy.  Jimmy does a dynamite walk.  Oh, that's right.  Jim Norton does a very good walking as well.  Oh, you said, oh, you were going to buy me a hat.  Oh.  I have to plug.  That's good, Jimmy.  Jim, oh, you can see him in Buffalo.  That's not bad.  It is getting there.  For New Year's Eve.  Oh, I, uh, December 28th through 31. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, uh.  And next Saturday, Thursday through Saturday, November 15, 16, 17, in Addison at the Improv.  You're doing New Year's in Buffalo.  Yeah, I'm a complete idiot.  Complete idiot.  I'm thinking, though, maybe we can figure this out.  Go up there.  I want to be up there in the winter once.  I'm just hoping my shows.  No, you don't.  Did you get injured when they threw the bars of gold at you to do that show? 
[00:53:00]  Let's just say it took a little convincing.  You want me to go where, when, for how much?  All right.  Bubble.  And now, another bedtime story with Jim Brewer.  Lars gives a call.  God, this is like 98, something like that.  99, maybe.  And he goes, um, dude, what are you doing tonight?  I said, I'm playing down the village. 
[00:53:30]  Let's fucking hang out.  I'm going to meet up with some friends.  It's going to be great.  On the way over, we're in a cab.  We cabbed it.  And some kid from NYU left his knapsack with all his books and notebooks.  So, you know what?  I'll be a nice guy.  How cool is it?  Guy from Saturday Live is going to send him back his books.  Well, this is a thorn in Lars' ass.  For the minute I get it.  For the minute I get it, dude, what are you doing with the fucking nap?  Get rid of the fuck.  It's ridiculous.  You look like a fag walking around with this fucking knapsack. 
[00:54:00]  So, I'm walking around with this thing.  I said, I'm going to give it back.  Why does the knapsack bother you?  It's fucking stupid.  Fuck that guy.  He's irresponsible.  Fuck him.  It'll teach him a lesson.  He tears the knapsack off my back.  I said, what are you doing?  He tosses it across the street, hits some chick in the leg, and it opens up and the bags go all over.  And he's walking down the village going like this.  There's your fucking knapsack, huh?  Are we hanging?  Fuck the knapsack, huh? 
[00:54:30]  Huh?  I'm like, Lars, what are you doing?  Chill out.  And he keeps getting in my face.  Are we hanging or what?  I went, I don't know if I can live up to this.  I talk a great game, but I don't know if I can live up to this status.  Stay tuned for more bedtime stories.  With Jim Brewer.  I was driving home and I was behind a bus.  You know, like the bus has an automatic sign.  9-1-1, call police.  I call 9-1-1.  9-1-1, what is the emergency?  I'm on 10th Avenue northbound and I'm behind a bus and the sign says call 9-1-1. 
[00:55:00]  I thought it was a stolen bus.  I didn't know what was happening.  There could have been hostages.  I mean, we all saw that Keanu Reeves movie.  I'm on the phone with a 9-1-1 and this fucking dummy is, where are you now?  I said, I'm northbound on 47th Street on 10th Avenue.  Okay, you're on, now where are you now?  I said, 48th Street.  Where are you now?  49th Street.  And you said it's heading which way, sir?  Northbound.  The only way you can go on 10th Avenue.  We're so irritated with these dummies.  So we make the left on 57th Street.  We go down to 11th Avenue.  I go, look, he's making the left on 11th Avenue. 
[00:55:30]  It's a yellow light, so the bus slows down and then shoots through the light and leaves  me at the red light.  I knew that the bus did that on purpose.  I'm like, this guy knows I'm behind him.  Now we're going southbound again.  So I call back.  No, I'm always emergency.  So I just called and no one is doing anything.  I'm following a stolen bus, I think.  No one is doing it.  How long does it take to get a squad car on fucking 11th Avenue?  So I pull up next to it and it's really dark on the bus.  And I just see some, there's a black dude.  I'm on the phone.  I'm like, I'm looking at the guy.  And he's just a black dude, but he's not dressed like a bus driver.  And I know that he's stealing this bus.  I'm northbound now and he's behind me. 
[00:56:00]  And they're like, what street?  I'm like, now we're passing 40th Street.  The woman was like, where was he before?  10th and 11th, but then he came down 11th and now we went up 10th.  He's probably going to turn it off because you're going to lose him.  So you keep saying 10th and 11th, but 10th and 11th are in parallel.  What street and 11th?  I know, he was on 10th and then he went down 11th.  So then I was just like, fuck this shit.  And I drive away and he pulls away slowly and starts to drive.  And I'm like, you know what?  Forget it.  You know what?  He just turned it off.  He just turned it off.  Okay.  We lost him.  And he probably turned into the bus depot. 
[00:56:30]  Serious XM.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  I want to congratulate Louis C.K., man.  SNL, huh?  Fucking SNL.  He walked out on the stage.  I'm like, holy fuck, that's Louis C.K.  On SNL.  My God, man.  You've been on our show.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  I think you did very well with the SNL.  That makeout scene was unbelievable.  I didn't get to see it. 
[00:57:00]  Really?  That was at the point where my truck was powering my house and it didn't have enough power for  the TV.  You missed Lincoln.  He did a very big takeoff on Lincoln.  I heard about it.  He did the whole open to his TV show as Lincoln.  As Abe Lincoln.  Redid the whole fucking thing.  And instead of Louis doing the stand-up, it's Abe Lincoln doing stand-up.  As if it was Lincoln.  And then they shot a little scene with Lincoln getting ready to go to the theater with his  wife.  But in the Louis style, it was very, very well done. 
[00:57:30]  Good for Louis, man.  We'll never see him again.  But that's okay.  We understand.  Oh, you think that's it?  Oh, God, yeah.  Oh, man.  Think about it.  When was the last time he was hit?  That's true.  And he listens every morning.  Hi, Lou.  Hi, Louie.  Or he says he does.  Oh, Louie.  We'd love to hear from you, Lou.  We'd love to hear about your experience with SNL.  That would be kind of cool.  Sure.  Just talking about Louis C.K. on SNL.  Also, really fast. 
[00:58:00]  Jay Moores is down the hall.  We're going to get him in in a couple minutes here.  They ended up canceling that marathon.  Yeah.  But they didn't use any of the supplies for the people because I was there all weekend  checking it out at the finish line.  And there were plenty of generators.  Oh, all kinds of good stuff.  Lots of water.  It wasn't being used for people that needed it.  Other shit that I don't even know what it was because, you know, it was in boxes and whatnot.  So they might as well have just held the marathon.  Yeah.  No, the police didn't get used. 
[00:58:30]  They didn't have to waste the cops.  No, I was just joking.  Of course, they shouldn't have fucking done it.  But they should have fucking used those resources.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  Jeez.  I just got a...  They did the right thing in the end, though, and canceled it.  I do...  There was a...  I tweeted from the finish line.  People were understanding, more than understanding, but you could see they were sad because in  their worlds, because I know a lot of people going, oh, too bad.  But in their worlds, it was everything to them.  Sure.  And we all think about our dumb little world. 
[00:59:00]  And these people are coming from all over the world and they're making a whole week of  it in New York.  That's their big life.  So I didn't see a lot of people going, oh, that's...  You know, fuck you.  I can't...  You know, they were totally understanding, but you could see the sadness was in the air.  Because people were running the marathon all weekend long on their own.  Yeah.  And if you went to the finish line, you see all these people finishing their version of  the marathon, and there were a lot of tears.  Like, you know, this was something I was looking forward to.  This is what I wanted to...  Yeah.  And you have every right to say, oh, tough shit to those people. 
[00:59:30]  I get it.  But I'm just giving you their perspective that I saw this weekend in Central Park.  Imagine the guy that broke the record.  Imagine if there was one guy who ran it like an hour and 20, and no one believes him right.  No one believes him right.  Hour and 20.  It's not official.  By the way, impossible.  No, it's not.  Hour and 20 is impossible.  For a white person.  Not for Superman.  Not for a Kenyan.  All right.  Good point.  And we got to point out all the people in their marathon gear going down to Staten Island  and other places and...  Oh, they were helping out?  Yeah.  There's pictures and videos all over the place.  A lot of people said, look, I'm here. 
[01:00:00]  You know, I was going to run the race, but now I'm going to do something else.  And, you know, and they were down there cleaning up and stuff.  Well, that's mighty nice of them.  Abso-fucking-lutely.  I got a text from my LIPA guy contact, and...  Good news?  No, he's talking about the two guys that came by the other night that I was talking about  earlier.  I had a couple of LIPA guys.  They knocked on my door at like three in the morning to explain to me the gravity of  the situation at my house.  He goes, my guys the other night thought they were going to get shot while you watch TV. 
[01:00:30]  I guess they were looking in the front door.  Somebody watching TV.  Finally, yeah.  And then he goes, the guy, Bill, tells this kid, Sass, don't walk back there.  This dude's usually pretty heavily armed.  You've got to get shades, man.  That is hilarious.  You've got to get shades.  Yeah.  Maybe I do.  You've got to fucking have metal gates that come down or something.  Like, I am legend.  But, uh... 
[01:01:00]  That's funny.  Something else.  The marathon was a big story.  They did the right thing.  Oh, Mike Francesa.  I know we beat him up.  Oh, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know we beat him up on the show.  You were telling me about this.  Because it's very easy to beat up Mike Francesa.  But someone turned me on to his rant on the New York City Marathon.  It's on YouTube.  Fucking...  I don't even know if he understands how funny he is.  I don't think he does.  But I don't think he's purposely being funny.  No, he's just being himself.  But he's being himself in a way where it's hilarious to listen to. 
[01:01:30]  Maybe the guys in the back could pull a couple clips.  He's got a couple of really good rants on the marathon.  He was losing his mind about it.  Like, you know, people running through a disaster area just taking sips of water and throwing the rest on the ground while people are dying of thirst.  Well, this is just a fat guy who hates the marathon on principle.  Any excuse he could have had to fucking bash it.  Really?  What?  I got a minute and a half clip over here.  Oh, let's try it. 
[01:02:00]  We'll go to...  Yeah, let's go cold.  I don't know if this will work, but...  I mean, you've got people standing in front of demolished houses three miles from the Verrazano Bridge.  Yeah, it's insane.  I mean, really, this is one of the worst calls, Jay, you're right on.  It's one of the worst calls I can remember.  You've got Christie over there holding a press conference basically saying that it's Armageddon in New Jersey,  and you've got them ready for a marathon over here.  I mean, come on now.  You're still going door to door in Staten Island trying to find that there's dead bodies in the houses,  and you're holding a marathon? 
[01:02:30]  Christie's talking about not having enough clean water in the state,  and you want to hand out, you know, cups of water being thrown in the streets,  being handed to runners who drink a little and throw it up in the air,  and in New Jersey, they don't have any clean water.  Now you want the street to be littered with half-full water bottles  from guys who are running in a marathon who are pouring it on their heads  and throwing half-used bottles in the street, 
[01:03:00]  and in Jersey, they don't have any water.  The governor's saying they don't have any clean water.  Well, come over here, they'll throw the bottles in the street,  they're in a marathon, you can pick it up.  That fucking Mike's getting pissed, that's great.  Good for him.  How can you think of it?  How much worse can it get?  You know what a marathon or a race looks like.  You've got littered water bottles half-used all over the place.  You've got the governor saying we don't have any clean water. 
[01:03:30]  How many times are you going to make the same fucking point?  It's maddening.  Is it maddening?  Third time he made the same.  He has nothing to say.  I enjoyed it.  Same point three times in a row.  It's hilarious.  They're going to throw water.  They've got no water in Jersey.  Water comes.  I whined.  I enjoyed it.  I enjoyed it.  But it's the same thing you're saying.  There's a 40-minute rant on it.  I bet he goes up 20 times.  Because that's why it's funny to me.  It's like he's obsessing about it.  He can't wrap his head around the fact that people need water. 
[01:04:00]  They've got no clean water.  And these marathon runners are going to fucking take a sip and throw the rest on the ground.  They didn't throw it up in the air.  I watch the marathon every year.  And I'm telling you that they waste so much water.  There's huge puddles where the water stations are.  Yeah, yeah.  Because they just take a sip, you know, wet their mouths a little bit and just throw the rest of the ground.  They'll be running through it.  And there's people like just dying of thirst.  Right.  Well, it's like Governor Christie's saying they've got no clean water in the state.  No clean water.  Water.  I don't know.  I liked it. 
[01:04:30]  Mike Francis.  I wouldn't have minded if he made two different points.  He made the same point three times.  I got it.  I heard you the first time.  Well, the longer version is there's a lot more to it.  So he just loses her mind.  Oh, water.  And then Wittenberg crying her eyes out.  I hear that.  Oh, was she?  Mary Wittenberg.  Boy, did she get a beating on Twitter.  Uh-huh.  Oh, boy.  Good.  What is she in charge, basically?  Of the New York Runners Association or whatever.  It's all she does.  It's probably all she talks about is running. 
[01:05:00]  Running.  Shut up.  The timing was horrendous.  But of course you had to cancel it.  Yeah.  Of course you had to.  You know, the ING New York City Marathon has always been about bringing the city together.  And when we were hit with this unprecedented storm earlier this week from the earliest moments,  New York coordinators and the mayor's office came together.  And the whole idea was for come Sunday for the marathon to really bring everybody together.  Uplift everybody and help us both honor those who've been hurt and lost. 
[01:05:30]  Honoring them how?  And by the way.  It doesn't honor dead people.  What you're hearing here is a whole line of bullshit.  Of shit.  They're seeing all the money and all that shit.  Yeah.  And the money that she probably makes off it.  And she'd have been all over the press with her smiles and, hey, look at what this is.  The first thought is never, well, this will bring the city together.  That's never the first thought ever.  Sometimes that's how it works out.  Uh-huh.  But they're thinking about the money. 
[01:06:00]  How much money are they going to lose if they cancel this marathon?  That's what they were thinking.  Precisely.  Her voice is annoying because she kind of has that thing.  That's right.  They all bring the city together.  I've got to listen.  Her voice is irritating.  I've got to listen.  And people are mad that the Giants played yesterday.  They're like, if you cancel the marathon, why aren't you canceling the Giants game?  Why didn't you cancel the Knicks games?  I think you canceled one Knicks game, right?  Yeah, Knicks Nets he canceled.  The first night out.  They're private events. 
[01:06:30]  They're not funded by the fucking government.  They're not using 2,000 cops.  They're not running first downs through disaster areas.  They're a totally different thing.  It is a different situation.  100% different.  You don't cancel everything.  You just don't have a city-sponsored marathon where people are jogging and running through the disaster area.  That would be like if people were living on the field and they still had the game.  Like they opened up Giants Stadium for refugees from the storm. 
[01:07:00]  A quick shanty town.  Yeah, they put up some tents and let the people live there, but they still played the game.  Yeah, I'd see where it's different.  I understand in a way you can't shut down everything because of what's going on in your city, but the marathon is unique.  I mean, they promote it as, you know, a celebration.  You're running through five boroughs.  Amazing.  Yeah.  And one of the boroughs doesn't have water!  Water!  They don't have clean water!  They're throwing it up in the air! 
[01:07:30]  They don't have clean water!  He's all mad.  I love it.  I kind of liked it that he kept going back to the water.  It was the same point.  It just was, we got it.  Honor those who've been hurt and lost in this really difficult, tragic storm.  Yeah, because that's what the family wants to see of their loved ones that perished in this super storm, as they're now calling it.  Yeah.  Oh, they're honoring my dead relative by running through my fucking town.  Yeah.  And the other thing Mike Francesca brought up? 
[01:08:00]  What, Jimmy?  Oh, no.  What happened?  I just saw this.  What happened?  Somebody's printed a picture of a Halloween costume.  It's all wheezy.  Wheezy laugh.  What is it?  Oh, no.  The caption was, great Halloween costume ever.  And, oh, my God, it is. 
[01:08:30]  What is it?  It's a guy.  It's a guy.  And he's got like...  I couldn't make it out.  That isn't even right.  He's got like...  It looks like there's a kid blowing him.  Because he has like a backwards baseball hat.  And the kid's arms are around his legs.  He walks around with a little kid blowing him. 
[01:09:00]  That's terrible.  Holy fuck.  Oh my god, is that funny.  How do you walk around with that costume?  Oh shit.  Oh my god, this is fucking hilarious.  Oh my god, that made me laugh.  The other point Francesca made was that they were shutting down gas stations in Staten Island.  Oh great.  Before the marathon. 
[01:09:30]  Why?  Before they cancelled it.  Because it was in the way of the race.  So they were actually going to close down some of the gas stations.  Un-fucking-believable.  Because they couldn't have the race and people trying to gas up.  And that was another point he made where he was losing his fucking mind.  And people, they drink gas, they throw the gas.  We got no gas.  We got half water and gas on the ground.  Gas.  Right.  People got no gas.  So he's basically saying they're trying to gas up and they're shutting down gas stations just so they could fucking have this marathon. 
[01:10:00]  So this is all the points.  When you hear the stupid Mary Wittenberg, it's all bullshit.  They were trying to figure out how to save the marathon because it brings in a lot of fucking money to the city.  It really moved the city forward.  And it's sad, but what has happened in these last few days is it became clear the marathon became a manner of controversy and division in the city, which is just not.  It's so opposite of what this event is all about.  So it was time to make an incredibly difficult decision that we made together. 
[01:10:30]  And the decision was, this is about moving the city forward.  How is it a difficult decision?  It's the obvious decision.  But they call it the no-brainer.  It's the no-brainer.  What is she talking about?  And the decision was, this is about moving the city forward.  It's about this marathon lasting for many, many decades to come and continuing to inspire people and help the city.  And it was time to just move on and let the city focus on our efforts ahead and on to recovery. 
[01:11:00]  You had the mayor's support in this, but you didn't have the support of a lot of the other city leaders.  Well, I think, yeah, I think there are lots of different opinions about whether the marathon should have run or not.  She still thinks it should have.  Of course she does.  Of course she does.  She's not even apologetic.  Self-centered twat.  Of course she does.  She doesn't believe any of this shit she's saying.  Of course not.  It wasn't her decision to cancel it.  She was told that it's going to be canceled.  Right.  She was not in on the decision. 
[01:11:30]  Sorry.  That probably came from Ray Kelly, who I think is the police commissioner.  I bet you it came from them and they said, look, there's going to be a problem.  There's going to be attacks on the runners.  Someone's going to throw something and hurt one of your runners.  It was leading to her that big time.  And I bet you that probably came from Ray Kelly.  Yeah.  She didn't decide this.  She was told.  She wasn't in on the fucking decision.  What do you think, Mary?  Yeah.  I think the city needs to recover.  I think we have to do the city.  Fucking Chip Wittenberg.  I fucking hate her.  If we have to run the race or something, how come they call it a race when it's all different 
[01:12:00]  races or something?  Run or not.  I think that there are a lot of negative voices and that had a lot to do with our decision  because, again, it fed this controversy and conflict.  Not your decision.  Someone told you this is what's going down.  And you get your almost pretty face on TV and you fucking play your part.  There's no tough decision.  No.  There's people who have fucking their homes are gone and you want to set up a race through  their neighborhood.  That's not a tough decision. 
[01:12:30]  No.  Fucking bitch.  Go jump.  How about this?  You head on the turnpike south and run for 25 miles.  Then take a train home, soft-centered cunt.  Fucking annoys me.  Yeah.  That's the city.  I thought the city would have to recover from the city.  Fucking awful.  You know what a rotten blowjob she wants to give with that rabbit mouth?  That's the city.  Just put the tip of your penis in my mouth.  It'll bump my teeth.  She has fucking Edgar mouth.  I hate it.  And I think they're going to try to run this thing, man, because they didn't start taking 
[01:13:00]  it down yet.  It takes well over a week to take down the whole finish line area.  And they're not using the stuff.  But you get so many people.  Because they build all these temporary stands and, I mean, tents.  And they can't be flying in, though, like twice.  Well, I think what's going to happen, a lot of people obviously are going to fly home.  But I still think they just might do this in the next week or two.  And it'll just be one of those years where it's a weird year for the marathon.  I think they're holding out hope. 
[01:13:30]  I don't know.  When would they do it?  Do it.  How about they do it in December?  They would have to do it very soon.  No, they would have to do it very soon.  Yeah.  I'm wondering if they're just holding out, hoping that maybe they could squeeze this  in in the next week or two.  Those generators just sit there.  I'll have a report tomorrow because it'll be obvious if they start taking down the stands  and stuff.  Yeah, I saw generators just sitting there over the weekend.  Sitting there.  Sitting there.  I saw a pile of water.  Big, huge, like those big fucking office water fucking bottle things. 
[01:14:00]  Why don't they fucking distribute that?  Eh, well.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Nothing.  Do a quick break and we'll get Jay Moore in here.  All righty.  We'll do Jay Moore next.  Kevin Pollack's coming in as well.  He's promoting his book, How I Slept My Way to the Middle.  Three of us are going to be doing walking.  It's going to be crazy.  Oh, insane.  I think you got this, Jimmy.  I got it.  Me and Jay probably do the best, too.  I think you got this.  Oh.  It's, uh... 
[01:14:30]  Oh, it's coffee.  Oh.  I do them all right.  And we got Terry Bradshaw.  Is he in trouble?  Yes.  Yeah?  He'll have to...  He probably should apologize for this one because it was...  It's like sometimes you say something and you make your point.  This was just one of those dumb things.  And so there's nobody that hears it that doesn't go, what are you doing?  Even though everyone knows he's not a racist.  He's just one of these dumb jocks.  But, you know, you can't...  It's just a stupid thing.  Well, we'll discuss this with Jay Moore, certainly next. 
[01:15:00]  If you haven't heard what Terry Bradshaw said...  Oh, yeah.  We'll let you know next.  New to SiriusXM's Fantasy Football Show, it's the Jim Florentine Show.  Putting the fun back in fantasy football.  Nothing exciting about fantasy football.  It's fucking guys in khakis and button-downs watching football.  They bring their laptops to a fucking sports bar to come over.  Who just scored that touchdown?  I go, why?  I got him on my team. 
[01:15:30]  Fuck you.  Go in the ladies' room and take a piss.  It's Jim Florentine and your calls.  Talking everything fantasy football.  Hey, Jim, what's the best way to keep up with your team while the game is on?  Nobody watches fucking football with a laptop open.  Nobody.  You have a fucking case of beer and some sandwiches,  and you're talking about fucking getting a handjob from a stripper in the door of a commercial.  From the night before.  Hey, man.  You know all your listeners love fantasy football?  I don't give a shit.  No fucking manly men play fantasy football.  We aren't even sure why we hired him. 
[01:16:00]  It seems counterproductive.  And we're going to open our fucking laptops and our iPads,  and we're going to have a draft.  Who are you going to take?  How about take it in the ass, you fucking homos,  or you fucking fantasy football?  It's just nerdness.  The Jim Florentine Show on Sirius XM's Fantasy Football Channel.  Go in the ladies' room and take a piss.  Coming this fall, Daytime TV is back with a bite.  Hell yeah.  Spend your weekday afternoons laughing, loving, and learning with Mike. 
[01:16:30]  I'm not going to say anything about the vagina.  Heavyweight champion of the world, Mike Tyson, leaves the ring behind  and hosts his own daytime TV show, giving dating advice.  That's how it is.  Everybody know.  You stick with your ex even though you break up  till you find somebody whose sex is better or just as good.  Sharing personal experiences.  Don Keenan, give me my badim.  I couldn't eat, motherfucker.  I'm going to beat you a grown man.  I ain't eat, motherfucker.  Fuck you, nigga.  And getting a little rowdy with the studio audience.  Fuck you!  Fucking do it! 
[01:17:00]  Yeah!  Mike lets the audience in on his more reserved, well-read side.  Yes, sir.  My diction's too precarious for your comprehension.  I will endeavor to exclaminate more profoundly.  Yes, ma'am.  But he isn't afraid to let loose now and then, too.  Booga, booga, booga!  Booga, booga!  Weekday afternoons this fall.  It's Mike.  Woo!  Hosted by Mike Tyson.  What do you say, champ?  What?  Chip Chipperson on the scene. 
[01:17:30]  Chip Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah!  What's that?  We're doing interviews for Chippa TV on the YouTubes about the UFC event.  Who did you want to see?  Who are your favorite fighters and kickboxers and karate guys and judo guys  and mixed martial artists and UFC guys and that like?  I want to go see Clay Guida.  Clay Guida?  Shut the fuck up.  I'm trying to talk.  He's always...  You're okay, right? 
[01:18:00]  I'm good.  He says shit.  Should I turn my hat like that or something like that?  Like, yo, what's up?  We're here in the Expo, y'all.  Clay Guida?  Clay's a weird name.  What is he, live in New York or something?  Who do you want to see win the big boxing fight?  The boxing fight?  The mixed martial fight.  I'm for Chael Sonnen, man.  I'm an American.  I got to go with the American.  Yeah, my mother always said that there's too many of these goddamn uncircumcised guys  coming in here, Chipper.  They're all uncut.  I've been saying all day, silver is gold. 
[01:18:30]  Silver is golden, man.  No one can beat him.  He's the best on the planet.  Yeah, and Chael Sonnen, they're going to change him to Chael Moonen.  Chipp, Chipperson on the scene.  Chipp, Chipperson on the scene.  Yeah!  Fucking home run, Chipperson.  Serious Exit.  It's the O.P.  R3 Show.  Nothing stays the same.  I'm changed.  And you hear the bell running. 
[01:19:00]  Change.  And nothing stays the same.  I'm changed.  Yeah, you hear the bell running.  Ah, it's our song, Jay Moore.  Eddie Trunk.  Stupid Eddie Trunk.  You weren't here that day.  I wasn't.  When we were going over his top five list for his book,  and he was trying to be the guy too cool for the room.  I was listening to that. 
[01:19:30]  Was it top 12?  It was like top 15.  Yeah, it was like top 15.  These are the essential Van Halen songs, Anthony.  You're going to want Jamie's Crying.  You're going to want, why can't this be love?  You're going to want, and Hope and I are like.  Oh, you guys tore that apart.  I remember I was listening to that show.  I think it was Iron Maiden, and he didn't put Run to the Hills.  I'm like, what are you doing?  Or Number of the Beast.  Or Number of the Beast.  I'm like, come on.  Which are like the staples.  You're trying way too hard to be that guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Run to the Hills, I don't give a fuck, is an amazing song. 
[01:20:00]  It still needs one verse, though.  It's one verse short.  It's a great song.  It's one of the best rock songs ever.  Metal songs, but it needs one more verse.  What separates it for me from the other songs is the bridge is so progressive.  It's phenomenal.  You think it should have wrote like one more, Jimmy? 
[01:20:30]  One more verse, because it starts off.  What about some engines?  You know, soldier blue, and it should.  And then there's one more, because they just keep going, Run to the Hills.  The band is looking at it for like one more.  Run for your.  How many times are you going to say it?  That is the coolest part.  We're learning that Jimmy doesn't like when you're repetitive today.  I don't know.  Between Iron Maiden and Mike Frances, he's having problems today.  I love Run to the Hills.  They're throwing water in the air.  Water.  Same thing he said.  We got it.  He's so sick.  Yeah, the soldier blues in the barren way. 
[01:21:00]  All right, Mike.  We heard you.  And they don't have clean water.  Let me tell you something, Mike.  It's not a bad idea.  You have a reservoir filled with water for the people running the marathon and making  a mentor.  We'll be back at the house.  But it's not clean water.  It doesn't have to be clear, Mike.  It doesn't have Run to the Marathon.  Don't you understand?  Governor Christie's saying they don't have water, and they're dumping it on their heads.  So who's Governor Christie?  Who's he?  Are you telling me mile 19?  He's the honcho, dog.  All of a sudden, you're going to have clean water?  It's mile 19.  But they don't have clean water. 
[01:21:30]  It's the New York Marathon.  They were saying they're going to dump clean water on their head.  But the people in Staten Island don't have clean water.  Is it the Staten Island Marathon, Mike?  Is it the Staten Island Marathon?  Because last time I checked, folks, it was the New York Marathon.  Let's go back to the phones.  We have Anthony and Bayside.  It's one of the boroughs, and it's a war zone.  They're devastated.  You don't run a marathon, they don't have clean water.  Mike, what about the boys and girls?  They got cheated out of a chance to watch a marathon on television. 
[01:22:00]  Listen, there's boys and girls.  They sit with their folks, and they watch a marathon.  They were cheated out of that.  Giants lost last night.  Let's take your calls.  We got Greg on the line.  Greg, how are you?  Let me tell you something.  Marathon is 24 miles.  Not a borough.  Not Staten Island.  Run to the hills.  Needs an extra verse.  Did I mention they don't have any clean water?  Who cares? 
[01:22:30]  Bruce Dickerson, one of the greatest frontmen of all time, he doesn't like the songs.  Mike.  The bassist writes the songs for all men in songs.  I like the song because it's very pat.  It's very nice.  Not much to think about.  Want to run to the hills?  Run for your life.  But when I'm running for their lives...  They don't have clean water.  They're running for their lives over there.  They don't need clean water.  Boys and girls cheated.  Let me tell you something, folks. 
[01:23:00]  You're not out of it until you run the entire...  How long is the maritime?  22 miles?  23?  24?  I don't know.  22.4?  I was sleeping.  It's a long run.  And when you're done, it doesn't have to be water, folks.  You can drink vitamin water.  Pepsi Max.  There's plenty of other...  This is...  This is bordering on Keitel.  It really is, yeah.  Let me tell you.  Who the fuck are you to cancel this marathon?  They gotta run. 
[01:23:30]  You're gonna run.  I watched that recently, by the way.  If you think you're not gonna run...  Fucking great.  You got nothing coming, man.  It's so fucking...  They ought to throw everybody in a pool or something.  So...  Good one, Chip.  Jay Moore's here and...  Good one, Chip.  They canceled your gig.  The Brigada.  Mm-hmm.  Fuck!  They couldn't get Atlantic City back in shape, huh?  I think the loge was still underwater over there.  Wow, really?  Yeah, it was bad.  Yeah.  The casino's gonna remake it up this month. 
[01:24:00]  The casino's never lost power, but the locals certainly did.  Yeah, the locals need to come in and...  There was a nice situation going on.  They got it fucking wrapped up over there.  They know.  They know where their priorities are.  Underground generators.  All that shit.  All that good shit.  Who knows a dog on the ground?  Yeah.  Wow, that was Colin...  That was Colin Keitel dog.  Jesus.  That's what happens.  Wow, that's a wreck.  I got the Terry Bradshaw clip.  Ah, let's hear about this.  I heard this briefly.  It was dumb.  You heard it, right?  No, I did not. 
[01:24:30]  Is there a context that it was taken and that people made a mistake?  What was it, Reggie Bush?  Reggie Bush had run it in.  And you know, I kind of hate that...  I like Bradshaw with that fox.  You know, just I hate the good times.  They're always laughing.  It's nothing but laughs.  You know, he's just going fast.  So, he had something stupid.  Oh, boy.  All right.  Oh, come back inside.  Look at this, Jimmy.  Like you were chasing that bucket of chicken that the wind was blowing the other day.  Oh, boy.  18-30 touchdown.  Miami 17-13 on top of the goal. 
[01:25:00]  Glad you said it didn't.  I tickled myself.  I'm glad you said it didn't do with him.  Whoops.  It was just laughter and merriment and he said something.  Jason, that bucket of chicken.  We saw blowing down the street.  I guess they had watched a video of a, whatever, bucket of chicken eating.  That was dumb.  Oh, would they watch the video?  I'm guessing.  He said specifically Jimmy.  Yeah.  For Jimmy Johnson, I guess.  Is he on Fox?  Yeah, Jimmy Johnson is.  Did they watch a video of some guy chasing a bucket of chicken down the street?  I don't know.  I can only surmise because he said that video. 
[01:25:30]  I would like to see the video.  That sounds hilarious.  Fucking bucket rolling down the street.  A very particular guy?  Yeah, well, could be.  I don't have a problem.  He said that bucket of chicken.  Yeah, they're just fucking doing highlights.  Can I hear it again?  Yeah, let's hear this.  Play your version.  This is the version.  And we'll do that.  Yeah, Reggie Bush is making a fine run.  It's not quite Jimmy the Greek level.  He's running like he's chasing a bucket of chicken.  Hold on a second. 
[01:26:00]  Let's break this down to the cellular level.  Terry Bradshaw just said he's running.  Like he's running for a bucket of chicken.  Yeah.  Chasing it, yeah.  Or like how that other guy was chasing that bucket of chicken.  Right, right, right.  Like he's chasing the bucket of chicken.  Or like that guy was chasing the bucket of chicken.  Well, here's the highlight they were looking at.  So let's break it down.  Hit it, sir.  Well, I don't think there's chicken on the field, though.  I would.  Wouldn't that be great if there was?  Oh, look at the side.  Look at this, Jimmy.  Hand it to Reggie.  Bounce outside.  Oh, cut back inside. 
[01:26:30]  Look at this, Jimmy.  Like he was chasing that bucket of chicken if the wind was blowing.  The other day.  Oh, boy.  The wind was blowing a bucket of chicken the other day.  Like he was chasing that bucket of chicken like the wind was blowing the other day.  Yeah, so that's an inside thing between them.  So it's an inside joke.  And I have absolutely no problem with it whatsoever.  I have no problem.  And the PC police better stand down on this one.  Stand down!  So he was talking about something they had both known about or saw.  But it's one of those things where I don't think he's in any trouble.  Wait, is there a video of a guy chasing a bucket of chicken?  I would love to know about it. 
[01:27:00]  Is there a statement from Terry?  Maybe they were just watching it and they saw a guy on the street doing it.  Yeah.  This is SB Nation?  This site here, Sam?  This person writes,  You can't have the words chasing a bucket of chicken play over any clip of any African-American football player.  It's the most vile and prevalent stereotype around, even if it sounds super funny.  No, he could say something like,  And he's tripping over his own huge dick!  You know, that would be more horrific and stereotypical. 
[01:27:30]  Rod Jimmy, look at him, he's tripping over his own giant black man dick!  I remember Lynn Swine and John Stallworth used to have a contest!  I think I just did Springsteen by accident.  You know, when I was growing up, Lynn Swine and John Stallworth always had contests about their dicks.  This is Badlands.  Bruce Springsteen, Harry Carey.  I'm a mess.  I'm a mess.  I was up late last night with DeRosa. 
[01:28:00]  We were up at the...  Oh, man.  How do you go out with DeRosa if you don't drink, is all I want to know.  He didn't drink at all.  What?  Yeah, we didn't drink.  Then you weren't out with DeRosa.  You went out with someone else.  I went out with a man that looked like the warden from Midnight Express.  Colin had the best line about him and Bobby when they were on stage.  They were doing something for Cheat for their book,  and Colin went on and said,  They look like King Kong Bundy and Rachel Maddow.  That's rich.  Which one of them could possibly look like Rachel Maddow? 
[01:28:30]  DeRosa.  DeRosa with his dumb glasses.  See, I had him as King Kong.  His stupid glasses.  With the hairdo and the glasses.  It's the dumb glasses that he wears.  All right.  So what happens to Terry Brunch or anything?  He has to apologize.  Ah.  He has to apologize to King Kong Bundy, you know?  Enough already.  Enough of this shit.  This was a dumb one.  I'm actually taking the other side on this one.  I don't think you should get in any trouble.  Yeah.  Well, you know the culture, I guess.  You know people are going to fucking point that shit out.  Because I hate political correctness,  it doesn't mean that nobody can ever say anything dumb. 
[01:29:00]  I wish this would all just fucking stop with this fucking nonsense.  Yeah, I agree.  I wish black people would fucking calm down about any type of stereotype,  or racial fucking bullshit.  I wish fucking,  we could go back to using the word retard for what we remember it as a child,  which doesn't have anything to do with a mental handicap.  It's your stupid fucking friend who was being a retard.  That's it.  I'm sick of this.  What about faggot, too?  Faggot, too.  Exactly.  If your friend didn't want to go out with you and fucking ride bikes in the woods or something,  he was being a faggot. 
[01:29:30]  Didn't mean he was sucking cock or any other homosexual thing.  It wasn't about fucking faggot.  That's spoken like a man who has a new contract.  We did sign recently, so fuck it all.  That's not spoken like a man waiting for one.  Boy, Jay Moore is very perceptive.  I do not have one.  Oh, shit.  That's why I sit this out.  There's many things I like to say.  I got little buzz notes.  I'll just go back to doing Colin, you know?  What do you really need to know about King Kong Monday, 
[01:30:00]  except that Jim Norton is going to be at Helium Comedy Club in Buffalo December 28th, you know?  What better way to shake off those Christmas blues and the birth of Christ  than to go see a scallop in sweatpants?  What's that boner medication you take, you zilch?  Silex or Silex or Silex, what is it called?  Guy sits on a train, takes pictures of his own junklings, Alexander the Great.  Philip II of Macedon in first class with an erection. 
[01:30:30]  All of a sudden he's Martin Kennesaw Landis, swinging a big bat, you know?  Silex, I couldn't get it out of you.  Right, Silex.  All right, I couldn't think of it.  Relax, Anthony.  Sorry.  Sorry, Jay Collin.  Ann Coulter raised a good point about the fucking, because she refuses to apologize,  which is why I wanted to.  Oh, we got that for her.  We got that clip?  Oh, good for you.  She said something about how it's a technical term.  Yeah, Piers, well, we have the clip.  We should play it.  Okay.  Could someone get that clip?  It's in E-Rock shit.  E-Rock's not here today? 
[01:31:00]  A technical term.  That's a technical term.  No, meaning...  Well, Piers Morgan challenged Ann Coulter on this, and she...  I was impressed.  She didn't fucking back down.  That's what she believed.  She was saying that these words all meant something like medical or technical, like stupid,  or...  They were all certain, I believe, technical terms that kind of just became common usage.  Right.  It didn't break down like you were talking about a person with my voice.  Oh, exactly.  It's a little long.  You want at least...  How long is it?  Which one is the Piers Morgan one? 
[01:31:30]  Anthony longs for a simpler time.  I long for a simpler time, Jay.  You're absolutely right.  Well, because it's getting out of control.  It's out of control.  I have a special Ann, right?  So you can't say the word around her, because the radar goes, it's DEFCON 5 if she hears  it.  Sure.  They know what that means.  That cracks the code that from that one moment, they know they're being completely ridiculed  and mocked.  But however, having not said it for so long, when you do say it, it actually means this 
[01:32:00]  stunt of growth.  You can go like, well, that's been retarded.  Retarded, right.  And it means that.  Retarding the spark on your fucking distributor.  All right.  Once again, Anthony was going to work in Tesla coils.  He's good to, you know, when you're at home, working with your hands on your Tesla coils.  Why do your eyes change?  Because I'm a weird person.  It's so fucked up.  It's great.  The voice is there.  Independent.  I'm going to go John Anderson this election, like 1980, all over again.  You want to hear him? 
[01:32:30]  Hold it down, dummy.  The 28th of December, go see Jimmy in Buffalo.  Shit.  Here's the end.  That doesn't bother me at all.  I shouldn't.  I enjoy him very much, Jimmy.  Let me just close this in with you.  You're a very intelligent woman.  You're very controversial.  You're very intelligent.  And you would have known absolutely the furore that would have come up.  Here's the furore.  You would have known absolutely the furore.  I would recommend the Prime Minister look across the dispatch box and dispell any controversy. 
[01:33:00]  Well, you know, I would assume many people probably want to strike you with a nice, firm piece of aluminium.  If it was in their schedule.  Oh, no.  I bet you want to get a bunch of crumpets thrown at you or something.  Here's the tweet that you tweeted.  It's during one of the debates.  Here's the tweet.  At the end of the third debate.  Right.  But when you read that back, you know what you did there.  You know it was a deliberately incendiary thing to say. 
[01:33:30]  Incendiary.  You knew that you were using a word that would be latched on by everyone who has a disability in America  as their equivalent of the N-word to black people.  Why did you do it?  I think you were doing what you were so testy with Sununu doing to Colin Powell.  You were just interpreting and announcing to the world what my motives were.  I was sending out a tweet.  Yes, you did.  You did it because you knew it would be incendiary.  No, I sent out a tweet that I thought was relevant at the moment.  And it was. 
[01:34:00]  Because at the end of the third debate, all the chit-chat was, why was Romney so gentle?  Why didn't he go after Obama on Benghazi?  Why didn't he go after Obama on the Benghazi cover-up?  But why call the President of the United States a retard?  Because it's a synonym for loser.  And we were spending ten seconds on this or it's going to be another two years before I come on.  Because I am angry at the word police.  I need an encyclopedia Britannica to see what words are appropriate and which ones aren't.  Okay, explain to me why retard is inappropriate. 
[01:34:30]  Because I heard you this morning say, look, what if I said imbecile, idiot, cretin or moron?  That was too nice to know.  Right, whatever.  Any of those four words, as you know, has not become in the last decade or so a word that is synonymously offensive to people with disability.  But if you call him an imbecile, that's okay.  That's so stupid.  But that's what she was saying.  Did you say crescent?  Yeah, a cretin.  You're a cretin.  A cretin.  You're a plebeian.  Plebeian.  That's a dumb argument. 
[01:35:00]  Imbecile?  I'm so conscious because Obi says my eyes change.  There they go again.  Yeah, that's a stupid argument.  Yeah.  It's retarded arguments.  If retard's not accepted in your world, then imbecile and the rest of them shouldn't be accepted in your world.  Why is one okay and the others don't?  They're all terms that were used for mentally handicapped people years ago.  But Pierre's basically saying if you said imbecile or something like that, that's okay.  But retard was the cream of the crop word that rose to the top.  I thought I was with her until she said, I won't come on here for another two years. 
[01:35:30]  Like, you have to say, I'm never coming on this show again.  You can't go, you know what?  It'll be a good 24 months before you see me again, fella.  They have an inside joke with that because like, come on, last time because of that.  It took about two years after the last time.  Yeah, it took a while.  So it's kind of a jokey thing.  Thanks to people with disabilities and is used in an offensive way about them by people.  That is the difference.  Do you call people with mental disabilities retards? 
[01:36:00]  Because I don't.  And I think that's a nasty thing to do.  A lot of people do to be offensive.  No, they don't.  They do.  And you know that.  They absolutely do not.  And you know they do not.  Of course not.  Can you go back because I talked over that part.  That's a good fucking point, though.  You don't call people with mental handicaps retard.  You just don't do it.  And I don't use that word like that.  But when one of my friends are being an asshole, I'll say, you're a fucking retard.  Right.  But you don't say to her, hey, look at the retard. 
[01:36:30]  Oh, that would be fucking crazy.  You'd be a savage.  But you would say the retarded person that went by.  No.  I wouldn't say that.  I would say retarded person.  For a handicapped person?  Yes, because that's honest.  And it's not derogative.  Carlin had a bit on about a simple honest language.  But there's a difference there.  And we're saying that you would never say it to his face.  Right, right, right.  But I'm saying I would say the retarded person.  Really?  Yeah.  Because I don't think that's derogatory or mean.  I'm not being vicious when I say, like, their son's retarded or their friend's retarded.  You would say to your friends you're being retarded.  But you would never say that actually to the person with a disability. 
[01:37:00]  But you would explain high retard.  There's a difference there.  You wouldn't go high retard to the retard.  No, no, no.  Of course not.  You say it to Sam.  And that's the borderline right there.  That is the borderline.  That's the Mendoza line.  He's a trainable.  He's a trainable.  Trainable.  Yeah, let's get back into history.  He's wearing trainables.  You ever see the trainables?  You ever see the trainable videos?  Oh, it's fantastic.  Oh, we've done hours and hours and hours trainables.  So she's asking Piers Morgan if he would ever call... 
[01:37:30]  I talked over the part that I...  I think I went back far enough.  Yeah, let's give it a listen.  I apologize.  That is the difference.  Do you call people with mental disabilities retards?  Because I don't.  And I think that's a nasty thing to do.  A lot of people do to be offensive.  No, they don't.  They do.  And you know that.  Not a lot of people do.  The entire world says...  Not to their face.  That's not what she's saying.  I don't think.  Not to their face.  She's saying referring to us.  No, a lot of people say they do that to be offensive.  But are they doing it to the actual person? 
[01:38:00]  I would say no fucking way.  And there is...  There's three levels here.  There's calling your friend a retard.  There's referring to a mentally handicapped person as a retard to someone else and say,  oh, yeah, his family...  He's got a retarded son or something like that.  And then there's going, yeah, look at the fucking retard.  That's...  The last one is really bad.  That's what she did to the president.  The last one.  Yeah.  Yeah, but he's not retarded.  If he was retarded, which is up for debate.  You're going to convince Anthony of that?  It's up for debate.  No?  I think that makes a pretty good point. 
[01:38:30]  The third one is the one that doesn't happen often.  Right.  That's the one that doesn't happen.  And the second one isn't even that incendiary.  Incendiary.  It's just...  You're just referring to somebody with a mental handicap as being retarded.  Which is accurate.  But that's like saying nobody says faggot about gay people.  They do.  Gays say it all the time.  You faggot.  But you know what I'm saying?  It's like...  They do say it.  They love that word.  They do.  They love it.  That's their end word. 
[01:39:00]  You ever see Q&A?  You ever see Q&A?  When he calls me, he's like, where are you, you faggot?  I'm on a boat.  Calls up to Nancy.  I could vomit.  It's the fucking best phone call ever.  It's okay when they say it because it's F-A-G-G-E-T when they say it.  Oh, is that it?  Yeah.  See, it's not the actual...  I can say it because I am one.  Right.  You can't say it.  Right.  Yes.  Yes.  And you can say it because you're one, but then I can't say...  My wife had the best point in regards to the N-word.  The N-word. 
[01:39:30]  You know, Carlin said there's the seven dirty words you can't say on television.  Uh-huh.  Right now, make it eight.  Yes.  Just make it eight.  Kevin Hart can't say it.  I can't say it.  Anthony can't say it.  No one can say it.  No one can say it.  Because if I'm in the supermarket and say, motherfucker, the whole place goes, whoa.  Yeah.  There's no like, well, he can say it because he is one.  Yeah.  All right, Oedipus.  That was a weird way to go with that.  You know?  Stupid eyes again.  That's all I'm focused on now. 
[01:40:00]  It's not the great impression, but the fucking eyes go fucking back.  I have the impressions with no eyes like Eddie Fitter.  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Don't sell out to the man, but you could buy my ukulele album at Starbucks.  All right.  That's my new favorite of yours.  The Eddie Fitter impression.  Well, I appreciate that.  O.P. has been a fan of the band for a long time, since before Stone and Mike were even  in the band.  So that's O.P. and Anthony.  Brought to you by Meligenuine Draft. 
[01:40:30]  But don't sell out.  Look, if you look around, there's no advertising in this building.  It's beautiful, man.  It's really beautiful.  The beauty of Eddie Vedder is he's an amazing performer, but when he has to talk to the  crowd, he's so fucking lost.  It takes him forever to figure out what he wants to say to him.  He's an old man.  It's unbelievable.  Oh, right.  Where'd I put my cane?  I appreciate that very much.  That was daughter.  And next, we'll probably do it again a little bit later. 
[01:41:00]  Thank you.  I guess if it takes all night, it takes all night.  Wow.  I'm 91 years old.  It's a lot.  That is amazing.  Alone in a breakfast.  They always got to talk.  The lead singer syndrome, we all know, Ant knows, is rot gut front man.  Oh, yes.  Wow.  But even like Bruce, you go see Bruce and he'd be like, you know, when I was growing  up, my old man used to always say, when are you going to cut that hair?  And my mom, she was a real romantic, you know? 
[01:41:30]  And they played those bullshit notes when they're talking.  Forever.  Forever.  Like Nils is backstage getting fucking lobster claws.  Stevie Van Zandt's combing his wig.  And Bruce is up there like with his fucking wife and her not plugged in acoustic guitar.  Like, way to go, tambourine lady.  You know when I was growing up, my old man used to say, when are you going to cut that  hair?  This is Badlands.  You're like, what?  That's your segue? 
[01:42:00]  Haircuts and Badlands?  Badlands!  Oh, Jesus Christ.  I know, I understood exactly what Bruce was saying about his father, because my old  man, I didn't know who he was.  This is his daughter.  That is amazing, Jay Moore.  Don't tell me who to vote for.  Don't tell me your politics.  Don't tell me to bring fucking canned goods.  You know what, Bruce?  You're the multi-multi-millionaire.  You bring a fucking jar of peanut butter to the show, you prick.  You stop.  I saw Pearl Jam in Philly, and he was bitching and complaining that not everyone is able to 
[01:42:30]  vote.  They're making it hard for the people to vote.  Yeah.  That was not.  That was a big political rant.  It's very hard for people of color to vote.  And, uh...  And, uh...  He does end a lot.  Let me enjoy this red wine that costs a hundred dollars a bottle, and somehow that was  Sandler again?  I don't know what you're saying.  I am all over the ice.  Don't forget to vote.  It's going to be a good time election. 
[01:43:00]  I go.  I go, go, gaga.  $20 million.  I would like you to pay me now.  I go, gaga, gaga.  That was Steven Tyler.  You want more Colter on the retards?  Yeah.  I'll hear the explanation.  Do you call people with mental disabilities retards?  Because I don't, and I think that's a nasty thing to do.  A lot of people do to be offensive, yes.  No, they don't.  They do, and you know that.  They absolutely do not.  And you know they do not.  Of course you do.  You know no one would call a Down syndrome child a retard.  It is synonymous with the loser.  You know perfectly well no one would use that. 
[01:43:30]  But that's complete nonsense.  You know what would have been offensive?  Wait a minute.  You're not going to go with it.  That is complete nonsense.  Nonsense.  That's the whole point.  The whole point, if you talk to people who work with Down syndrome children or whatever,  they will all tell you one of the...  You're going to keep saying that this is offensive and you're just wasting time because we only  have ten more seconds on this.  We're getting to the next topic because, okay, it's offensive and you're going to come up  with 20 different ways to tell me it's offensive.  It's offensive according to whom?  Moron, idiot, creton, imbecile.  These were exactly like retard once in technical terms to describe people with mental disabilities. 
[01:44:00]  Changing the word doesn't change the condition.  I was not referring to someone with Down syndrome.  I was referring to the President of the United States.  I know that.  I didn't make a joke about Special Olympics the way the President did.  I didn't make a joke about extra chromosome right-wingers the way Al Gore did.  Those are specific conditions.  I didn't call the President a Down syndrome child.  I used the word retard the same way people use idiot, creton, moron, and the rest of them,  which were all once technical terms. 
[01:44:30]  And I've had it with the language police.  And you were wrong that, oh, no one else is laughing.  Everyone is fed up with the language police.  Actually, they're not, but you wouldn't use the N-word, would you?  You've already said that.  Oh, not the N-word argument.  Okay, now we are back to...  That's a good point, though.  That's a great point you made.  I think we know what she sounds like when she's laying under Bill Maher now.  An argument.  Scream.  Okay, now we are back to my book mugs.  No, of course not.  For one thing, the N-word is like a curse word.  Why would you allow the word police, as you put it, to make any exceptions? 
[01:45:00]  I should have called my book three books back about guilty liberal victims and their assault on America.  Everybody wants to be black.  No, unless you went through slavery and went through Jim Crow,  I do not want to hear victims bullying the rest of America.  And this is what has happened.  Whether it's the Jersey girls or the spokesmen for the disabled.  It's not the disabled.  It's the self-appointed spokesman word police.  The feminists on this word or that word. 
[01:45:30]  The gays on, oh, you can't say, oh, that's so gay now.  No, you weren't in slavery.  Because you don't use the N-word because you know that it would get you into serious trouble.  No, I would never use it.  And you know that it's the offensive hypothesis.  I'm sorry, you're doing what Sununu did to Colin Powell.  You're going to leave my mind to tell me why I would use a word or not use a word.  No, you're wrong.  I wouldn't use the N-word because it's a curse word.  Will you carry on using the word retard?  Yeah, I've done it since that tweet.  Do you believe that she wouldn't use it because she thinks it's a curse word?  I don't think she's being completely honest to you.  She probably wouldn't use it in most situations.  It's so over the top. 
[01:46:00]  She knows if she called the president the N-word, that would be her fucking career, man.  Yeah, there is a certain – I think he knows that.  Can you make it or break it?  He has a point, too.  He has a point, too, in that people do say retard about people with Down syndrome.  Even though you don't say it to them, you do say it to be nasty, that bunch of fucking retard.  I mean, there are times when people say it, and everybody knows it's used for that, but it's still used in a way like you talk about your friends, and I don't think she should be in any trouble for it.  But that doesn't mean you can't acknowledge how we all know it's used at times. 
[01:46:30]  Well, the second part of this, Piers Morgan talks to a retard.  Oh, I did see that.  No, he talks.  But he actually talked to someone with a disability.  With Down syndrome.  To basically give his point what the word means to him.  But who cares what the word means to him?  He obviously doesn't see life the way you're supposed to see life.  Like, you know what I mean?  Stop.  What does fish have to do with this?  Chip, chip.  God fucking call me that.  You got to watch it with him. 
[01:47:00]  Sea life.  I would have said, what's it, a D-E-F-N-G light, too?  Here's, uh, I fucked up.  I'm tired, Sam.  I fucker.  Here's a chip TV on YouTube.  Don't miss it.  Chipper.  Chipper TV.  We all know.  No, I'm not watching that.  I'm watching chip TV.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's the chipmunks from Disney.  They're good.  Here's a slow, uh...  A special boy.  A special boy.  Yes.  And Eric.  You heard Ann Coulter there, uh, trying to insist... 
[01:47:30]  Can you pause it real quick?  Pause it.  This kid is trying to fucking wonder why the fuck he's talking like this.  He's like that.  He sits down.  He's probably never heard of British accent before his life.  And all of a sudden, Pierce Morgan's like,  I'm in the control of a seat with the words.  And this kid's going, wow.  Oh, man.  I'm getting worse.  Oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, man.  This is accelerating.  Oh, no. 
[01:48:00]  This poor child is sitting across from a fucking bridge.  And, like, we were just sitting here going, oh, my God.  This is a Pierce Morgan's stupid voice.  And now there's a special boy in front of him.  The poor kid.  A special boy.  And he's in a goddamn studio with the lights and some stage manager putting a mic on him  like, sit still.  He did.  I saw this.  I saw this sitting there going, wow, we just taught him the Long Island accent, and now  he's going to deal with this bridge.  I saw this.  He actually does a great job.  I know he does.  Responding to this stuff.  To put a mic on him. 
[01:48:30]  Turn this way.  Sit still.  Look at it.  Here's your mic.  Look over there.  Oh.  This poor guy.  You heard Ann Coulter there trying to insist that the word retard is not offensive.  What was your reaction to that?  What did you eat in the green room?  Meaning, what was your reaction to that?  He just ate something.  It's so wrong but hilarious. 
[01:49:00]  Oh, my God.  No, this is fucking, I understand why he's interviewing the guy, but it's like, let's  go now live to an actual, like, yes, what Piers Morgan just did.  Right, thank you.  I know what you're going to say.  Was took what Ann Coulter did and just put a fucking bomb under it.  Like, let's go live now with a retard.  Live now.  She was not referring to a guy with Down syndrome whatsoever when she said retard.  Get on the phone and find me one.  Find me one of those.  Piers Morgan.  Put Ann Coulter in a tough spot. 
[01:49:30]  Man.  How did she come back from this?  Was she there?  Are you going to follow up?  No, no.  She's like a Latin fighter, man.  She's fucking me.  No, she wasn't there for this.  You're going to follow up my intelligence and explanation with this?  Yeah.  Why would she give any credence to this?  Because...  She was gone.  She was gone.  I know.  Because she wasn't referring to anybody with a mental handicap.  I wish she wasn't gone because I would have loved to see how she handled this.  She would have destroyed him.  Oh, my God.  Now I'm with Coulter.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because Piers Morgan is sensationalizing this. 
[01:50:00]  Of course he is.  You didn't mean that.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  This poor child.  Are you going to interview him about the election results, too?  Right.  I understand why you're asking him how it affects him, but come on.  Stop it.  It's just a fucking...  It's a sideshow.  That's why you're doing it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the bottoming out of Piers Morgan.  It really is.  What did the guy say?  I have to hear his response.  Yeah.  Okay.  Here we go.  The word retard is not offensive.  What was your reaction to that?  Well, the word retard is offensive and that... 
[01:50:30]  I can't look at you.  Oh, jeez.  He sounds like Roland.  Oh, he does.  He really did sound like Roland.  He talks much better than Roland.  Yes.  He really does.  I can't understand Roland.  Yeah, yeah.  I can't understand him.  It's offensive and that I should not be a symbol for someone who is dumb and shallow.  If they wanted to use me as a symbol, me as a symbol for someone who fights adversity. 
[01:51:00]  Frank, let me ask you.  I mean, if you...  Now, if you didn't...  If no one said I was a special person...  Yeah.  You'd go, we got this British guy.  Yeah.  Yeah, this British guy.  Hey, you know.  Oh, my God.  Anthony loves the normal.  Hey, that doesn't sound like a guy with Down syndrome.  That sounds like another British guy. 
[01:51:30]  Maybe an old British guy sounds like they got Down syndrome or something, man.  Who's funnier than Sarah Silverman?  Except a bunch of dudes.  He said that here.  He said that here.  You guys are looking at me like, whoa!  I don't remember him saying that.  That's hilarious.  That's hilarious.  I listen to your show more than a bunch of dudes.  I don't remember him saying that one.  Yeah, my God. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah.  Play the British guy.  Talk to that other...  The smaller British guy.  Adversity.  Oh, boy.  Controversity.  Frank, let me ask you.  If you met the President of the United States, have you ever met him?  I have?  He has.  Well, he obviously knew that.  Asked that to 5,000 guys with Down syndrome.  Was he lucky to find the one who has?  Yeah.  You know what?  I forgot for a second.  There was pre-interviews.  Yeah.  What, do you think he lucked up on that?  This guy, this man with Down syndrome here, this child, I don't know what he is. 
[01:52:30]  He's an adolescent.  What is he?  I don't know.  I can't tell.  He's like...  30 or 8.  I don't know.  He's part of an organization.  You know, he's...  That's absolutely right, Anthony.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, these special people, they want to run an American.  I'm sorry.  He's a special, special person.  He's doing a great job.  He's doing about as good a job as you can with people like Pierce Morgan.  CNN brought you this concert. 
[01:53:00]  That's why you spent $800 for your ticket, because there's no corporate sponsor.  That's why when you see the Rolling Stones, it's affordable, because it's Budweiser Presents,  you know?  That's why you spent $800 to sit all the way up top with your neighbors that ride the  bus.  This is River Window.  Eddie changed his tune, man.  The show I went to, there was Budweiser logos everywhere.  You live and learn.  What are you going to do?  The only thing I want to hear you say is, one, two, three, four. 
[01:53:30]  That's all I want to hear you say, Billy Goat.  I met the President of the United States.  Have you ever met him?  I have.  I recently went to the White House.  Wow.  Couldn't wait to get that one in.  Couldn't wait, right?  Popped in my head. 
[01:54:00]  Popped in your head, did you say?  Yeah.  Get out the boat.  Financial.  This is so wrong.  I don't think it's loud.  I mean, I want to hear what flowers are in a good life.  Why does he know the President?  I recently was at the White House at the signing of Rosa's Law.  What I was going to say to you was, putting aside the word retard that she used, I just 
[01:54:30]  thought, being that offensive about the President of this country.  You're allowed to do that.  You're allowed to, stupid.  I can't imagine that you would ever say anything offensive about your President.  Do you think there's a wider argument that, putting aside the disability, the word retard,  the offense it causes, people like themselves?  I call them a...  Okay, we're done here today.  You said retard like it's a nut.  Retard.  Yeah, yeah.  Almonds, Brazil nuts, retards.  A retard, a pecan, a retard.  Would you like another retard, a pistachio, a retard. 
[01:55:00]  There's a whole bunch.  Anthony, these are called Brazil nuts in my house.  Oh, you know what they call them.  In my house, they're called Brazil nuts.  We call them retard toes.  They're called, these are called Brazil nuts, Anthony.  Not, not, yes.  But retard.  And I'm sure he would have went to bat for Bush for something being offensive about Bush.  Of course he would have.  Stop with that, Piers.  Stop it.  And if Piers' question gets any longer, this kid's head's going to explode.  You're giving him way too much to try to figure out.  The arrested process.  Holy fuck.  Poor little fella.  The offense it causes to people like yourself, that actually you should just show more respect 
[01:55:30]  to the President.  Of course.  I mean, people should respect the President because, one, I don't know if the President  has ever been bullied as a child before, but I know that people, when people get bullied  and people use the R word, it's just offensive.  Oh, the R word. 
[01:56:00]  Frank, let me give you the last word.  You signed the letter to Anne Coulter from a friend you haven't met yet.  What would you like to say in conclusion?  Oh, no.  I don't know.  I would like to say, thank you.  You helped me make 3.2 million new friends.  Frank, thank you.  I wish that you would be one more.  I'll see what I can do.  Let's try and make you happy.  Just a pointless interview.  And now we're getting the, you know, you want to talk to Mike?  Sure. 
[01:56:30]  Mike?  Mike and Beth Page.  We get this every time we go down this road.  And, I don't know.  To a point, I guess I understand.  But, Mike, go ahead, buddy.  I was just going to say that I grew up in Long Island, much like all of you guys.  And, you know, until you have a kid that falls into this situation, like I do, you don't  really understand, you know. 
[01:57:00]  But it is an offensive word.  I have a son with a developmental disability.  In any context?  I'm sorry?  In any context?  It's an offensive word?  Well, I mean...  I mean, growing up before you had a kid, did you ever use the word about your friends  being like an asshole and say, oh, you're being a retard?  I'd be lying probably if I said I never did.  All right.  But, for some reason, I hardly did. 
[01:57:30]  Well, because, you know what?  You know what?  It affects you personally now, which is understandable.  So, you know, but the thing is, everything affects somebody personally.  We all, all of us, all of us in here have, are affected by things that we joke about on  a daily basis.  God, I make fun of mental illness all the fucking time.  And he's a retard.  And I'm a retard.  And, you know, I've suffered through that my entire fucking life.  Sorry, Jay Moore's pressing his nipples up against the glasses. 
[01:58:00]  We try to have a serious conversation with you.  I'm sorry about that.  He left.  I got an email from somebody, a father recently, who had a retarded kid, who was very offended  at a bit I had done.  Right.  And it got played on Raw Dog.  Right.  And he said, look, my...  What was it, your dad?  Yeah.  But he was very offended.  And he goes, he sent me a letter.  So I wrote him back, and I was nice to him.  And I said, look, I wasn't trying to offend you.  But it's a horrible thing because it affects you personally.  But if I start to think that way as a comic or something... 
[01:58:30]  Oh, you're done.  Then there's nothing you can make fun of.  And he wrote back and said, well, no, you just don't care.  Like, he did what Anne said.  He began to tell me what my motives were.  Right.  Let me go with that point, Jimmy.  Mike, and I want you to be completely honest.  Tell me something that you find really funny that obviously would offend somebody else.  We all have it.  Really funny.  I mean, listen, I'm on the...  I think...  I think...  I'm not trying to downplay your point, by the way, because it's a valid point. 
[01:59:00]  But I'm just showing you the other side of this.  A good black joke make you laugh?  Is it...  What is it?  What kind of joke makes you just fucking laugh hard?  Hairy guinea women.  But you know it's wrong when you're laughing.  You just know it.  Yeah, I mean, listen, most of the stuff that I hear on the station, I'm rolling laughing.  Yeah, so it's a point where this one hits obviously...  Hold on.  This one hits obviously close to home. 
[01:59:30]  Absolutely.  Yeah, and everyone has that.  I mean, everyone.  Every single day we have some horrible joke or some horrible humor that hits way too close  to home.  Didn't you laugh the first time you heard you put Velcro on the ceiling?  Come on.  Didn't you laugh the first time you heard one if you slice them thin enough?  It's just a tough spot that we're in because if we start really thinking about who we're  offending, we have no radio show, man.  You know what the difference is, though?  Most of the people that you offend in your fruit humor, and believe me, I love comedy, 
[02:00:00]  most of them in some way, shape, or form are able to defend themselves and kids with  this issue.  And believe me, listen, who would ever think if this would happen to your kid?  Yeah.  You know, hope you just have a kid, and you think, you know, you're viewing like your  child.  Oh, man.  That can be feel bad.  My son is going to grow up and be a lawyer.  My daughter is going to do this.  You envision everything. 
[02:00:30]  And then in one moment, you're shot between the eyes.  Right.  Yeah.  This information.  I don't mean to get down.  No, no, no.  But, like, a gay guy who, somebody says, oh, that shirt looks gay, he can defend himself.  Albeit very sissy-like.  But, Mike, can I interrupt you?  Not, again, not to downplay what you're saying.  But what you've done, and I know you're not doing it for any other reason other than  you're being sincere, is you have found a way, and I don't mean it was sneaky. 
[02:01:00]  It's just a natural thing.  You've found a way why what your point is is different and why, hey, look, I get it in  every case, but here's why it's different here.  Where now a gay guy may come back and say, hey, it's terrible to make fun of retarded  people, but you know what?  They're not being targeted in the street and beaten up and killed like we are.  Yeah, that's true.  And a black guy may go, you know what?  I have empathy for people with Down syndrome, and I have empathy for gays, but they weren't  hung from trees and then denied their rights for 50 years after this. 
[02:01:30]  Like, everybody has a very valid, valid point to themselves why something hurts or why it  doesn't feel right.  And, again, I'm not saying what you're saying is wrong.  I'm sure I would feel that way.  And there's a line between being funny and being purposefully cruel to a person.  Like, I wouldn't go up to somebody who's retarded and say that to them just because  it's cruel and it's bullying.  But there is a difference.  You've got to be cruel to be kind in the right measure.  You think run to the hills is another verse?  I do.  But do you know what I'm saying, Mike? 
[02:02:00]  Do you know what I mean?  Yeah.  Yeah, I do.  But, again, it's not that it's – I know it's very important to you.  Let me chime in here, Mike.  That's why we look at it that way.  I'll tell you why it's so offensive, because they're the only group of people that can't  defend themselves.  That's what I just said.  That's what I was saying, yeah.  You said that while you were –  Yeah, out of the room.  I was out of the room.  Hysterical laughing.  Sure.  I don't have a contract, Anthony.  I know.  But no one – anyone who's being seen themselves as being victimized in a moment – and sometimes  they are being victimized – they can't defend themselves, which is why they feel like 
[02:02:30]  victims.  Like, you know, you could say that about blacks and they would be like, we couldn't defend ourselves  if we did.  Like, the police and the dogs were sicked on us.  Like, everybody has that real feeling.  Then why do they call –  Let me tell you – let me just chime in on this.  Yeah, yeah.  Everyone has that real feeling.  Right.  Yes.  Damn.  Damn.  All right, Mike.  Thank you so much.  All right, guys.  All right.  Thanks, buddy.  Bye.  All right.  We'll move on from the R word.  Yeah.  We've got Kevin Pollack.  He's here.  He'll join the program next. 
[02:03:00]  Can I just say something?  Yeah, of course.  Kevin Pollack's here.  Oh, shit.  Nice.  Can you take us out as any better to break, please?  Yeah.  Oh, maybe we could play a good tune or something, you know, when we go out to break.  I don't know if you guys know this or not, but there's an election tomorrow.  And if you don't vote, then you're part of the problem.  But tonight, look out.  I see a room full of solutions and we love you.  Thank you.  When I was a boy of ten, I had a very special friend. 
[02:03:30]  Ed was kind with good intent, but just a little different or special Ed.  His mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he's not so bright instead.  He's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special. 
[02:04:00]  We'd play tag and he'd get hurt.  I'd play soldier and he'd eat dirt.  I like math and the spelling bee.  Ed like talking to a tree.  Oh, special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now she keeps him in the shed. 
[02:04:30]  Cause he's a little bit special.  Just a little bit special.  I ran track, hung out in malls.  Ed ran head first in two walls.  I had girly girls and lots of clothes.  Ed had names for all his toes.  Like Larry and Terry and Jerry and Barry and Ronnie and Bobby and Ricky and Mike. 
[02:05:00]  And if I love a girl who cares who you like, Ed.  Special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now he thinks he's a piece of bread.  Cause he's a little bit better.  Just a little bit better.  I thought college life was great. 
[02:05:30]  It could count from one to two.  I like people and the party scene.  Ed was scared of the vacuum cleaner.  Special Ed.  His mama, mama dropped him, dropped him on his head.  Now his favorite color is the radio.  Cause he's a little bit better.  Just a little bit. 
[02:06:00]  One day talking to Special Ed.  He grabbed a brick and he swung at my head.  And as he laughed at me, that's when I knew that Special Ed just made me special too.  My shoes hurt.  Now I laugh as I count bugs. 
[02:06:30]  I give strangers great big hugs.  Next to me, it is fine.  Yeah, he's a fucking Einstein.  Oh, Special Ed and me.  Now we're not right in the head, you see.  Now we're not so, not so bright.  Instead, we're a little bit special.  Oh, just a little bit special. 
[02:07:00]  That fuck red made me special.  Just a little bit.  Just a little bit special.  Don't laugh at me.  Stop laughing at me.  You stop laughing at me. 
[02:07:30]  And I'm sorry.  Don't laugh at me.  Holy ass.  That's a clip I've never heard before.  What's your name?  Was that Julia Lewis?  Yeah.  Do that.  Why didn't you think everyone was laughing at me?  Get ready, America.  Today's hottest impressionist is coming to a theater near you. 
[02:08:00]  Jim Norton, man of a thousand voices, live, in concert.  All your favorite celebrities are here.  Bill Clinton.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  I did not have sex with that woman.  Samuel L. Jackson.  That girl got snakes when you were playing.  Sylvester Stallone.  Babe, you're going to have to get a lot of body bags if that girl's coming to town.  And Christopher Walken.  Oh, I carried this iPhone in my butt. 
[02:08:30]  Jim Norton, man of a thousand voices, live, in concert, coming to a theater near you.  Oh, Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Run to the hills.  Oh, here's your song, Jay.  Put on your headphones.  Jay Moore in studio.  By the way, Jay's going to be at Governor's this Friday. 
[02:09:00]  Oh, shit.  Saturday, and it looks like Sunday, right?  At Governor's on Long Island.  Very, very cool.  And then the Stress Factory the weekend after that.  No, let's just talk about Governor's.  Governors, Friday, November 9th through the 11th.  They pay an honest wage for an honest worker.  That's right.  Jay Moore, 37 on Twitter.  Out there on Long Island, a lot of people are hurting.  They need to laugh.  That's the most Italian room in the world.  They make the Jersey Shore people look like Irish Jews.  It's the most greaseball, fucking mob-top weird. 
[02:09:30]  It really is, right?  There's a Bally's Fitness across the street.  And I swear to God, the Y burnt out last time I was there.  And across the street just lit up and said, balls.  I said, here we are, Long Island.  Balls.  Across your nose, you fucking Italian morons.  Come out and see me.  I love you.  And now joining the program, Kevin Pollack, who's got a book coming out,  How I Spent My Way to the Middle.  I remember last time you were in here, you were talking about this book.  Talking about that yappy thing.  It's finally out. 
[02:10:00]  Yeah, there it is.  It's physical evidence.  Is this your first book?  It is my first, and hopefully my last.  Hard to write?  Hard to write a book for you?  No, no.  And in fact, I'm kind of, whether the publisher wants me to talk about it or not,  I'm blown out the process and letting people know,  because it was the easiest fucking thing I've ever done in my life.  Really?  Yeah.  Yeah, the guys, my act, you know, I always did impersonations.  It was like, you know, Jay, and my, as we start to meet and work with the people that we mock,  they become part of the act. 
[02:10:30]  You know, you tell real life stories.  Instead of just saying, what if Christopher Walken were a busboy,  you actually say, I met the freak, right?  And you tell the story.  So the guy says, this is a book, these stories.  I said, I don't have time to write a book.  He says, well, we got a guy.  I said, you can't have a guy write my book.  That's ridiculous.  He said, no.  Here's the thing.  He's in Chicago, you're in L.A. or wherever.  You guys get on Skype.  He's a journalist.  He'll ask you questions that bring up stories from your filmography and nonsense.  And then he will send you the transcripts from the Skype session. 
[02:11:00]  And then you edit your own stories in their told version instead of in their written version,  which for storytellers is the best fucking possible way you could have a story told, right?  Yeah.  Because when you're writing it, you're just trying to recreate your own voice anyways.  And here it is, actually recorded my own voice.  So he did 15 of these two-hour Skype sessions.  He sends me the transcripts.  He doesn't write a fucking word.  I'm editing my own stories for three months, and I'm done with the book.  That's actually a smart way to do it.  You basically hired a, not to demean him, but for dictation. 
[02:11:30]  That's exactly what you do.  No one writes their own books anymore, though.  Well, that's the thing.  As I said, you can't.  You can't have a guy tell a story about, you know, please.  And I call people out on their shit in the book, too.  Because a couple people are real dicks, and they need, you know.  Like what?  Who is a dick?  Well, actually.  Give us a good one, man.  We'll sell some books for you.  I got a pretty, you know, I've not held back too much on the show before.  Kevin is not a fan of mine, by the way. 
[02:12:00]  The Independent Spirit Awards made a bit of a run-in.  What happened, Eddie Vedder?  What happened to Kevin Pond?  Well, I like Kevin, he's quite the orator, I'll let him tell you.  I love that.  By the way, your Twitter account, not Eddie Vedder.  If only he could be funny like that.  If only an actual piece of shit could be funny.  And he's doing that with an egg sandwich in his fucking ass.  I don't eat eggs because it's dangerous for the chickens.  Everything's important.  I don't eat anything that has eyes. 
[02:12:30]  Oh, fuck me.  What happened with Eddie Vedder?  Oh, Spirit Award.  This is not in the book.  But I was hosting the Independent Spirit Awards years back.  And he was in the audience.  And I made some riff about, actually, your great impression of Harvey Cattell was being honored.  He had a bad lieutenant out not too long before that.  So I said, and also the piano.  So it was a cock fest, basically.  And I said, his penis has separate representation. 
[02:13:00]  And he stared me down like he was going to...  Cattell did?  Yeah.  I don't understand your joke.  When I go see my agent, I'll bring it with me.  So I said something...  He's not a cross town, is he?  I said something about Marlon Brando setting up the Native American chick to accept his Academy Award.  All right.  I made a backhanded comment about it.  And Eddie Vedder sends me a note saying that the Native Americans work very hard on their resilience. 
[02:13:30]  Oh, God.  Hate that cocksucker.  All right.  So I go on stage and I take the note with me.  And I said, where's Eddie?  Where are you?  Well...  That's censorship, you piece of shit.  Go fuck yourself.  Good for you.  Oh, fuck him.  Absolutely.  You know...  And what did Eddie do?  I think he was passed out at that point.  I don't really know.  On his red wine.  No, but you know...  As a fucking...  As a musician...  Red wine.  He wants to say what he wants, but...  Yeah.  I know Eddie.  I hope he watched it so bad and I'm making him wait. 
[02:14:00]  He loves the fucking...  So I call...  Pollack's an asshole.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's who you want to hear it from on anything.  What a bore Eddie Vedder is.  I hate Pearl Jam and I hate him.  Love the Pearl Jam.  Maybe if it takes all night, it takes all night.  He's an old man.  So I go after...  Oh, yeah.  What's the story from the book?  I go after Michael Clark Duncan in the book and... 
[02:14:30]  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  I wrote it five months ago and when I tell you the story of what happened on the set  of the whole nine yards, you'll see why I wrote it.  So then before the book comes out, the publisher emails me and says, do you want to take out  the part of where Michael Clark Duncan's a dick?  And I said, you don't get a pass because you die.  Fuck him.  Wow.  Absolutely.  No.  And I understand he became, you know, religious or whatever towards the end of his life and 
[02:15:00]  he made amends.  Yeah.  Fuck him.  On the set of whole nine yards, he was a piece of shit.  Whoa.  What are you doing the whole nine yards?  That's offensive to dead people.  Dead people work very hard filling cemeteries and graveyards.  And without them, there'd be no Dawn of the Dead movies.  No zombies.  And he just sent Kevin another note.  What the fuck?  What the fuck?  Please do you a favor and hand this to Kevin Pollack because dead people work very hard. 
[02:15:30]  The dabblers and organ transplants donating things, of course.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They work very hard.  You're right.  This is black.  So you're on the set and...  Oh, hold on.  You're on.  So it's a night shoot and I come out of the trailer to go to into the van to be driven  to set and PA, like the pimply kid from the Simpsons guy, Mr. Pollack, I got your per  diem, you know, and I go to sign for the per diem, which is, you know, just a little envelope 
[02:16:00]  of cash separate from the paycheck that gets like an allowance, you know.  Yeah.  So from behind me, I hear, where's my per diem?  And I turn around and there's big Mike Clark Duncan.  And the PA says, I don't know, Mr. Duncan, they just gave me Mr. Pollack.  How do we know that's not my per diem?  Mike, it says Kevin Pollack on the envelope.  What do you want?  Give the kid a break.  Yeah.  How come you bring his and not mine?  Mike, you want to take mine?  I don't really give a shit.  I'm sure there's more per diem for everybody, you know.  And then he's just, he won't let it go and he's really upset. 
[02:16:30]  So we get in the van and we drive to the set and this is a name dropping fest because  of the actors that are in the film.  So I'm sitting with the Bruce Willis and the Matthew Perry.  And so we're there like 30, 40 minutes and, you know, fuck me, but these aren't guys  you want to keep waiting around too much.  And at one point, Bruce says to his right hand for 35 years, Stevie, he says, Stevie, what  the fuck?  Stevie goes off to the director to find out what's going on, why we're sitting around  cooling our heels for 35 minutes after they brought us to set. 
[02:17:00]  He comes back and he says, yeah, there seems to be a problem with Michael Clark Duncan.  I don't really know what it is, but I don't know what's going on.  So then the director comes over, Jonathan Lynn, lovely British man.  He says, yes, fellas, sorry.  There's a bit of a snafu with Michael.  Kevin, you may know something about this.  Bruce, apparently, you took us per diem?  Oh, man.  I said, sorry? 
[02:17:30]  And then I tell them the story of what happened and Bruce gets up to kill him, basically.  And I said, no, no, you know what?  At least it's like three in the morning.  I'd like to get the fuck out of here.  Why don't I just go over and say, you know, I'm sorry for any misunderstanding, Mr. Duncan.  Can we get back to work now?  Because the crew's standing around and everybody's upset and I don't really give a shit.  You know what I mean?  So Bruce says, fuck that and fuck him.  You know, and I said, no, no, no, seriously.  Let me just go over there because he and I know what actually happened 35 minutes ago with the pimply kid from The Simpsons. 
[02:18:00]  So let me just go over there and remind him because apparently he's convinced himself of something.  So I go over and Mike's sitting by himself.  Nobody's near him.  And I walk up and I say, hey, Mike.  And before I can finish the thought, he says, y'all think twice before taking a man's per diem.  Oh, fuck.  So he had convinced himself to me, the only actual witness of the occurrence, that I took his per diem. 
[02:18:30]  Yeah.  And so now I'm thinking, OK, I've got a nanosecond here to decide how to play this particular one.  I do have 60 people on a crew standing around waiting.  Maybe I just eat this one.  Fuck it.  What do I care?  So I said, you're right, Mike.  I really should have thought twice about taking your per diem.  I'm sorry.  I really don't understand what happened, quite frankly.  So anyways, whatever happened, I hope we're OK.  Yeah.  So I walk away and we get back to it.  And this is the scene where his character pours gasoline on my character's face so that they can set me on fire. 
[02:19:00]  And do you think there was a little extra oomph when he was throwing the water on me?  Boba Falka.  So here's the fun part.  Cut to, I don't know, a couple years later, I'm sitting on a fucking beach because that's how you get a job.  But I'm never actually detached from the mothership, so I have my cell phone with me.  I'm sitting on a fucking beach on vacation.  The cell phone rings.  Hey, it's Bruce.  And he calls like annually. 
[02:19:30]  So you take that call.  So, hey, hey, what's going on?  It looks like we're going to do a sequel to the whole nine yards.  Really?  Huh.  Well, my character died in the first one.  So are you calling to rub it in?  What the fuck?  Because there ain't nothing like sequel money.  So why are you hurting me?  He said, no, no, no.  You're coming back.  You're going to play the father of the character that you, you know, Yanni's father, Laszlo Gogol.  I said, oh, OK.  Is everybody coming back?  Yeah.  Everybody but Michael Clarke Duncan.  Fuck him.  Wow.  Yeah.  So he fucked himself out of the sequel.  Wow.  In the end.  Today, I told you Swinton is 52 years old. 
[02:20:00]  It's a celebrity birthday.  This is a life.  So, yeah.  So the editor calls and says, do you want to keep this in?  You know, and I said, you don't get a pass for dying.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Sorry.  And Rip Torn, same thing.  Crazy fucking lunatic on the set and shut down production every day with his nonsense.  Absolutely.  What movie was that?  Oh, boy.  This was Michael Moore's only fiction.  Oh, that's everything.  Canadian bacon. 
[02:20:30]  Right?  I like Canadian bacon.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  With John Candy.  Sure.  I saw it in the theater.  Yeah, sure.  So, yeah.  So he would every day after lunch, he would come back with a theory that somebody was out  to get him.  Oh, that's nice.  Yeah.  If I heard him say, I was on Nixon's list once, I heard him say it a million times.  Oh, boy.  You know, it was 44 years ago today that Richard Nixon was elected president.  Really?  Yeah, 44 years.  Now, Reggie Jackson with number 44, and we're going to try to hit this one out of the park  for you. 
[02:21:00]  What song, Eddie?  What song?  What song?  Oh, this is our field, who is the brains of JFK.  Nice.  I almost ran out of songs, though.  Yeah.  Yeah, he comes off as a kind of an unstable guy.  Yeah, a little bit.  Yeah, yeah.  All right, fuck all this shit.  Let me hear the walking.  That's goddamn walking in town.  Let me tell you something.  Whoa, wait a minute.  Jimmy does a good walking, too.  Let's all right.  I'm going to get to Jimmy's.  All right. 
[02:21:30]  All right.  All right.  All right.  Don't bury the lead here.  Pollock does the Talkin' Walkin' podcast, right?  Yes.  His second episode, he has to do a disclaimer in the beginning of it saying why the sound  in the first one was incorrect.  And if Sam, if somebody can pull this up, it's the most remarkable I've ever heard in  my life, and I lay down my king on the chessboard, no doubt about it, Kevin Pollock is the best  walker.  Well, it was three o'clock in the morning.  I think that was the reason, because I was exhausted.  I got out of a dead sleep with a sudden panic of, oh, shit, it's quiet in the house. 
[02:22:00]  I can actually record the disclaimer that I was going to do the next morning when it  was going to be loud and obnoxious in the house.  So I got up at three o'clock, and I was exhausted, and I think that's because it was  so relaxed and dead to the world.  And, you know, I'm afraid I'm doing, like, you know, like Dana Carvey's George Bush at  this point.  Because yours was so fucking perfect.  Like, you know, George Bush never went, not that, no. 
[02:22:30]  And, like, wave his fingers around, like, ee, ee, ee, like a guest on Piers Morgan.  Yeah, exactly.  It becomes a parody of the parody.  Yeah, I think I'm doing the parody.  Well, everyone on Twitter's been after me to have you on as a guest.  Yeah, I appreciate you having me on.  Please.  Oh, now?  Yeah.  Only by the confluence of events I get the invite.  You know what?  Wait a minute.  Have I not?  We haven't been on each other's podcast.  We don't get the disclaimer, though.  We need to do each other's.  I don't know.  What's the big deal with the disclaimer?  Oh, the sound was fucked up. 
[02:23:00]  Because I just had somebody help me set up guitar nonsense on the Mac.  Okay.  Why don't you just tell them?  Yeah, exactly.  Not as you.  So, it's funny.  He's, to me, he's the leader.  I can't do it in front of him.  Whoa.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, seriously.  You gotta do it, Kevin.  Otherwise, we'll never know.  Well, what about Jimmy?  Oh!  Oh, there it is.  Two guys.  Oh, oh. 
[02:23:30]  I don't want to steal the show.  That's Jimmy.  That's genius.  Come on.  Let's do the big showdown.  The people demand it.  It's been in the making for years.  I had Alan Arkin on my little internet chat show there.  And he just finished, you know, he's talking about Argo, of course.  Is he a nice man?  He's unbelievably cool.  And is Argo a good movie?  It's like Yoda.  Argo's a great movie.  Very good.  I enjoyed it.  If you lower your expectations and don't go in expecting the greatest movie ever made,  then you'll, in fact, think it's pretty terrific. 
[02:24:00]  I think that's offensive to Jason and all of the Argonauts.  Not just the one Argo.  George Bush is a Nazi fascist.  Enjoy your evening.  Get home safe.  Oh, there's no more songs left?  No, we're just getting warmed up.  That's what's great about Philadelphia.  Is you warm up.  It ain't any better.  That's so good.  See, that's the thing.  When you find that thing right there, when you find that rhythm, you can't get out of it, right? 
[02:24:30]  That's why I can't do walking, because I'm stuck like this.  Yeah, it's exactly right.  I'll walk around my house as hours sometimes, talking only as Christopher Walken, and not  realize I'm doing it until the cat passes out from fear.  I mean, that's literally...  You just don't know.  I usually either get stuck as Keitel or Colin, but they're similar guys.  All right.  Yeah.  They get in there.  We're all waiting for you to do walking, Kevin.  You know, you want to read an excerpt from the book, maybe?  Want to read another 20 pages?  Yeah.  Tell another story about a dead guy.  Creep. 
[02:25:00]  You just call your book posthumous stories.  Here's another doozy.  You guys ever heard of Carl Perkins?  Here's one.  Here's a doozy.  He does such a great fucking...  Oh, fuck!  That's insane.  These are one of the ones you can't do in Des Moines, by the way.  Yeah.  Says you, you know?  So what happened with Arkin?  Oh, so I had him on the show...  Christopher Walken.  And he just had...  He just finished the movie Stand-Up Guys without Pacino.  Not one Arkin tweet. 
[02:25:30]  And Christopher Walken, the three of them.  Arkin, Walken, and Pacino.  And I said, did you guys make this movie so that Jay Moore and I would have an extra 15 minutes in our act?  I mean, those three guys, you know, it's ridiculous.  Yeah, yeah.  You just see...  All back, Glenn, Gary, Glenn, Ross?  Pacino yelling.  Mm-hmm.  And Walken just staring, confused.  And then Arkin saying...  Right?  And then Arkin saying, fellas, seriously, you both need to calm down. 
[02:26:00]  I don't understand.  Why don't we just go to separate corners?  I'll be a craft service.  That's a great Alan Arkin.  That's ridiculous.  That's a great fucking Alan Arkin.  I'm going to go sit down.  Because I'm tired, not because you told me to.  Because I'm tired.  This is Bugs.  I like the introspective.  He's either introspective or yelling and screaming.  It's one or the other, right?  Yeah, yeah.  He doesn't have the energy to stand.  Or he's screaming. 
[02:26:30]  He never used to...  There are two different Pacinos.  Yeah.  The early Pacino and then the one now that just seems to...  The early Pacino sounds like Tyne Daly.  Tyne Daly.  Early Pacino and Dog Day Afternoon is the same as Tyne Daly.  Yes, sir.  Okay, Sarge.  We got it.  We got it.  Ah, well, what's under the desk?  A square room?  All right.  Any W.  We play all the hits.  If you got a boss, why am I talking to you?  We're Vietnam veterans.  Attica!  Put it down!  Put it down!  God is an absentee landlord! 
[02:27:00]  Yeah, then it turns into that.  Oh, yeah!  All right, all right.  Look, but don't touch!  Yeah.  All right, all right.  I'll do Leon Shermer.  Oh, go ahead.  Why don't you do the evolution?  You're not dying, sonny.  You're killing everyone around you.  All right.  Chris Sarandon.  Yes.  Yes, that was.  Wow.  Fantastic.  Oh, Chris Sarandon, another dissident.  Are they pulling Kevin?  I want to hear Kevin's that disclaimer.  I hope they're pulling it.  Yeah.  All right, Kenny got on it. 
[02:27:30]  Why don't you just do it?  No, I think Sam ran out of here.  So the book is called How I Slept My Way to the Middle.  You can order that and get it on the bestseller list.  You go to Amazon.  Go to the jmore.com website.  Click the Amazon banner.  Oh, there you go.  That's how you get some click-throughs.  That's the corporate show.  You know, we only got your book today because of the big superstore we had.  Yeah, we literally got it this morning.  Oh, don't worry about it.  I went like this and opened it, and I just saw John Belushi.  Did you know John?  Yeah.  In San Francisco, Bill Graham, the great concert promoter, 
[02:28:00]  had a lot of great clubs, and he would come out to the Punchline Comedy Club  and hang out a bit, and so I got to know him.  And he had a great rock club, the Old Waldorf.  And so I went there.  I did some shows with Dave Mason, if you remember Dave Mason, right?  Did a great version of All Along the Watchtower and had a couple of hits.  So we did some shows.  So I went to the Old Waldorf, and I see in the social area of the dressing rooms is a pool table.  I walk in, and their playing pool is Van Morrison and John Belushi. 
[02:28:30]  And this is, I think, like 79, and Belushi is, you know, at the apex of comedy godship, you know?  Animal House had just come out, Saturday Night Live.  It was, you know, he kind of owned and reinvented funny at that point.  So I should myself, basically.  So at some point, I'm like a fly on the wall, and then eventually Dave Mason and John Belushi go into one of these smaller dressing rooms and close the door.  And there's some interesting-smelling smoke coming from the room. 
[02:29:00]  And so I say, fuck it.  I have to meet John Belushi.  I just have to throw myself in there.  And I'm doing shows with Dave Mason.  I've got the entree here.  So I open up the door as Peter Falk, because you know how we use voices to meet people.  This is how we worm our way into people's lives.  Really?  You guys do that?  Absolutely.  The way you talk, baby talk in a relationship.  Honey, I don't want to do it now.  You know, this is what we do.  Yeah, then you punch him and say, you got him.  He's Uncle Paul.  So I open the door and says Peter Falk and say, ah, geez, I'm sorry. 
[02:29:30]  I don't mean to bother you.  I hate to be your paste.  I honestly do.  And Mason's got this giant joint in his hand, and, you know, it's like a steam room in there.  I can't see half of it.  And he looks up and he says, Columbo.  And then he points to the joint and says, Columbo, referring to Colombian gold at the time.  It was the pot the kids smoked.  All right?  Get over it.  So I start taking the joint and walking right towards Belushi and using the joint as a little cigar that Peter Falk would always have with him. 
[02:30:00]  And I continue doing the Falk.  And Belushi is leaning against the wall, pretty stoned.  And as I continue, he just kind of slides down the wall to his knees, which is why I guess that chapter is called How I Brought John Belushi to his knees.  And it was just one of those hero moments where it goes well for a fucking change.  Why did he slide to his knees?  Was he joking around or fucking stoned?  No, he was laughing.  Oh, he was laughing.  Oh, he was laughing.  Oh, you haven't seen anyone do it in your fault at that point.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's 1979.  Newspapers matter not to me. 
[02:30:30]  What the fuck is this?  Yeah.  It's a good song.  It's a good pro-drift song.  Oh, okay.  A window of my friends here.  John Belushi had a joint.  He was a true red mosquito.  Here it is, right here.  Oh, well.  I'd rather hear Jay Moore do it.  That's what I just said.  That's what I just said. 
[02:31:00]  Fuck him.  That's a good tune.  Are we doing this walking thing or what?  I'm waiting.  I don't know why we're doing it.  We're waiting for the podcast.  I can't imagine it's going to be anticlimactic.  Can you?  No, but it's free.  The podcast is free, right?  He's right in front of us.  Talkinwalkin.com.  Walking is spelled like talking with an I-N so his family can't sue me.  Or you go to iTunes, it's all free.  It's all just one letter saved.  Is that so they can't sue you?  Because this way you can't say people think it's him.  Okay.  Yeah.  Oh.  I'm not sure if Sam is... 
[02:31:30]  What are they doing?  Can someone tell us?  I don't remember what I did on the fucking thing.  But in the meantime, it was a porch.  You like in the garden now, Eddie?  Yeah.  Yeah.  In the garden of the Vita, maybe.  Oh, that's a different one.  I'm getting a little worsted.  So this is life worsted.  You know what?  Hey, I can't forget this.  Oh, wow.  The fucking video you guys threw up of the E.T.  Oh, Stone Cold E.T.?  Oh, my God.  Oh, God damn.  It's one of the funniest YouTube videos I've ever seen. 
[02:32:00]  My research producer on the chat show, Jason McIntyre, whose birthday was yesterday.  Fuck you.  Showed me this video, and I still can't stop laughing.  Have you seen Stone Cold E.T. yet, Jay?  I have not.  Oh, my God.  That's so funny.  Fuck.  The way that the mask moves.  Who is this guy?  We talked to him.  He's from Chicago.  He's pretty much a dud when he's not doing his fucking Stone Cold.  Is he out of his mind and hopped up on something when he's doing it?  I think he's a pothead.  He's a struggling comic.  He's trying to make it.  But the commitment suggests that he's whacked out of his mind. 
[02:32:30]  I knew Sam wouldn't fail us.  Yeah, I figured that's what he was doing.  I knew it.  Sam's a good man.  We'll play Stone Cold E.T. for Jay a little later.  But first, we got this.  Yeah.  I want to be with...  Especially solid Sideshow Bob today, by the way.  Especially solid.  What happened?  So we're playing something now?  Very much so, right?  I'm very confused, Jay Moore.  You brought this.  And this is where you said, I got to lay down my fucking cake. 
[02:33:00]  Yeah, this is the best walk-in I've ever heard.  And with that set up, you know it's going to suck.  Right.  No, it's perfect.  They're going to love when people do it.  Yeah, because he won't do it here, Jay.  Dangerous.  Because he won't do it here.  Oh, why don't you just do it for everybody?  What are you, Chubby Checker?  You know how I saw...  Chubby Checker wouldn't do the twist on our show.  I saw Todd...  Get the fuck out of here.  We got him to do it.  Oh, we got him.  Because he wanted a new song to play.  And I go, well, I guess we don't play your new song.  Oh!  Guess who was twisted in our fucking studio.  Oh!  He did the twist.  Ow! 
[02:33:30]  Now you get both right here.  That's perfect.  You got...  You got...  You got Walkin doing Chubby Checker.  No, we just heard Kevin Pollack doing fucking Walkin, finally.  Oh, really?  Oh, no.  There you go.  Oh, no.  Look at what you're doing.  That was not as good as mine.  By the way, I'll drop you like a sack of shit.  Let's hear the disclaimer.  How are you?  Welcome back to episode two.  Two.  Of Talkin' Walkin'.  It's me, your host. 
[02:34:00]  This is a disclaimer.  This is not the show.  I'm so sorry.  I have bad news.  I have good news, bad news.  I always hate that.  What do you want first?  You know, because the bad news for a second, it's going to suck.  It's going to ruin everything.  This is bad news.  Episode two, the sound quality is crap.  Yeah, it's shit.  But I got to warn you, it's with apologies.  We did it live in front of an audience at Caroline's on Broadway in New York.  Just as I was launching the first one, working in the hotel room and, you know, preparing everything, the website. 
[02:34:30]  It's all very exciting.  Thank you for listening, tuning in, making us a top ten comedy podcast on iTunes.  That's exciting.  In five days, we cracked the top ten.  Thank you.  It's your fault.  And I give you all the credit for that.  So, that's why I wanted to apologize.  Because the sound is such shit on this episode, what happens is, with the live audience, recording is not set up correctly.  So, the conversation spikes.  That's the word all the technicians are using around me, because I don't understand. 
[02:35:00]  Spikes.  They spike.  Okay.  Spiky.  Anywho.  Listen, I didn't want to burn the episode, set it on fire, throw it away, because there's too much damn funny.  And that's why we do it, I think, for the funny.  So, I wanted to ask for your forgiveness, your understanding.  If the sound is too shit and you can't listen to it, I understand.  Turn it off.  Forgive me.  Move on.  Also, please don't write bad reviews on the iTunes, because the sound was shit. 
[02:35:30]  If you don't think it's funny, by all means.  If I told you that it was Christopher Walken, up until the review part, you would not tell me it was not.  It's just, it's a strange Christopher Walken.  It's upbeat.  It's upbeat and energetic, which you never hear him.  You know, my favorite moment of that so far is the way he says New York.  It was such a weird pickup.  New York.  It was such a weird.  It's all the tiny little inflections.  Do it again.  You got it.  It's them tiny inflections. 
[02:36:00]  Jimmy does impressions, man.  Take him to the zoo, Rock.  I'll do, hey, here's Johnny, as Nicholson.  But the way he says New York was such a great grab.  And of course you do Robert Shaw.  Yep.  Yeah.  Does ice.  Is anybody going to do a fucking impression in this room?  Okay.  Jesus Christ.  No, Christopher Walken impression had been set.  What the fuck are you here for? 
[02:36:30]  I don't know.  Do your fucking walking already.  Well, because I know whatever I do.  It's a goddamn tweet fucking festival.  It's going to be followed by the crazy fucking stone vetter.  I don't know what I'd say.  There's no goddamn walk-ins in this room right here.  What?  Eddie Vedder just introing songs, man.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  I love Christopher Walken the most.  Eddie, tell us, when you wrote these songs, how high were you?  I was a state of mind, a state of love and trust.  I don't find those things go well together, love and trust, you know, because you can't 
[02:37:00]  have one without the other, quite frankly.  To me, if you're in a relationship and there's love, there's no trust for the man.  The man looks through her eyes.  Jay Moore's got to do a few different impressions, man.  It's time for Norma Jones to get real hot, you know?  Hey, Norma.  Hey, where do you want to get arrested or something?  All right.  Chop someone's head off.  Maybe they got it. 
[02:37:30]  Hey, Wendy, here's Johnny.  That's fucking good, man.  Kevin just did a spit take from that one.  Onto my own book.  Onto my own book.  Onto his own book.  I spewed it on my own face just now.  Not now.  You guys know Patty at work, right?  Patty, that girl.  I just chopped her head off, you know?  I took her out in the woods, you know?  She thought it was a date because she's dumb, you know?  I'm like, hey, Patty, let's go out in the woods, you know? 
[02:38:00]  It would be like a date, you know?  That's crazy, Greg.  I was really good.  It was like the second day we're camping.  Second day.  She's like, hey, let's get some red wine, you know?  And I, she's like, she thinks it's a date, you know?  Because she's dumb, you know?  And I go, let's have some red wine, you know?  And she goes, oh, my God, I love red wine, you know?  The exact fucking delivery.  It's crazy.  Then I chopped her head off. 
[02:38:30]  I don't even know why I did it, you know?  She really lights up a room, that girl.  That's what they always say when you die.  On that date, those shows, you know?  All your friends come in, you know?  And they sit in your chair in your house, you know?  And there's like a picture over your shoulder of you not lighting up a room at all.  It was just like some shot of your eyes or half closed.  And I hear drunk in a bar, like, oh, my God, I'm not lighting up a room at all right now. 
[02:39:00]  And then, and your friends go, oh, my God, Patty, she really lit up a room.  She lit up a room.  This is daughter, we're going to do it again.  He's just like, oh, my God, she lit up a room.  No one had a bad thing to say about her.  They say that about him, too, all the time.  They'll go, I don't even know what happened.  No one had a bad thing to say about her.  Jay, Jay.  Jimmy's going to do an impression.  Hey, Nurse Ratched, I'll bash your brains in.  Here's Johnny. 
[02:39:30]  The moment he said the word nurse, I wasn't looking at him.  I go, it's Nicholson.  Of course it is.  You just knew it.  Just close your eyes.  You know who else Jimmy does very well, and I haven't heard a lot of people do this, actor Gary Sinise.  Yes, please.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Just on Twitter, somebody asked me, right at me and said, make sure he does this, Gary Sinise.  Gary, close your eyes.  Don't forget to tweet your local food bank.  My eyes are closed.  The scene from Forrest Gump.  When he goes to the wedding.  He goes to the wedding.  Gary Sinise walks up with his Asian wife, and of course Forrest comes out, and he's amazed 
[02:40:00]  to see Lieutenant Dan standing on his own on his artificial legs.  Forrest, this is my fat Asian wife, Susan.  Now, how come we're millionaires, and I have a woman who looks like the lady, what's the  guy's name who sings that stupid populist song, that fat Korean, that's who I'm marrying?  And how come your wife has A's and a haircut like Sean Cassidy, Forrest?  She's killing the lawn by stepping on us. 
[02:40:30]  I don't care how mad you are at Forrest Gump, that's not half as mad as Kevin Pollard.  Just because I fucking died doesn't mean I don't make the cut in that book.  I'm fucking chapter five.  I may have lost walking, but I'm going down with the ship on this one.  Daddy, Larry, stop pointing that gun at my dad.  Fucking, you can have walking, you prick.  Wow, you're giving up on the walking.  No, I'm still going to close with it. 
[02:41:00]  Yeah, I'm still going to close with it.  Put a lot of time in.  There's no goddamn jobs in this town, are there?  Sitting around waiting for radio gigs.  You rat fuck!  Jimmy's going to be okay!  Do your goddamn rabbit sure!  You're going to do that rabbit sure, and if you don't think you are, you've got another thing coming, man.  Kevin Pollak was here, no walking impression had been sent.  He just laughed like somebody at the Apollo. 
[02:41:30]  He gets your whole body up and running.  That bad lieutenant.  Sit back down in the wrong seat.  That bad lieutenant when he's cursing and crying in the car.  Come on, Daniels, good eyes.  Ball two to Kyle Daniels.  Good eyes!  Good eyes.  Take a picture.  You!  He drops a hand bomb in his car and shoots his radio. 
[02:42:00]  Shoots the radio.  Nothing worse.  Not to be confused with Danny Aiello.  I just killed your fucking radio.  Oh, this is a song we used to hear on the radio.  It's Bob O'Reilly.  And I'm just fucking spinning the wheel of insecurity because Kevin's walking.  I'm like, look, what else I can do, Kevin?  Nothing worse than a Harvey Keitel crying.  You rat way to fuck with you!  Forrest, how come you and I aren't crying like that? 
[02:42:30]  I'm married to a fan Asian and you're married to a woman with AIDS.  Why are we smiling?  Robin's right, Penn?  Really?  Yes.  Do you remember?  Jenny had AIDS.  I have titanium legs like the space shuttle.  And you're marrying a woman who slept with everybody but you.  And then she has AIDS and she's a waitress and now she loves you.  Don't you ever call him stupid.  She tastes like cigarettes.  You're not supposed to kiss a hook around the mouth, you fucking retard.  That was latex and semen, not cigarettes. 
[02:43:00]  Dummy.  Hey, hey, hey.  Ah, shit.  Well, it's just crazy, all these impressions.  Amazing.  Jimmy's, uh...  I'll do whoever you want.  Jimmy's amazing.  Jimmy's amazing.  Yeah.  The well does not have a bottom.  Whoever you want, I do.  Yeah.  Kevin's book, How I Slept My Way to the Middle.  Yes.  There's amazing endorsements.  They get great pictures in here.  I'm actually jealous.  I was flipping through looking at your photos.  There's a picture of me teaching Carson how to do William Shatner and I didn't want to 
[02:43:30]  get called out on why the picture's in there.  So I busted my own balls by saying, I only wrote this book so that I could put this picture  in here.  Oh, very good.  The whole book is a vehicle for one picture.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is your number one celebrity picture right here?  Oh, wow.  Let me see it.  How sick is that shit, right?  Is it your number one celebrity picture there, Kevin Pollack?  You're in Carson?  Oh, that's great, dude.  I got Carson doing Shatner.  That's like he's a monkey.  You just know that that's exactly what you two are doing right there, by the way. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah, that's with the hands out in front of you.  How is Nicholson, by the way?  That's a great picture.  Are you in a thin jack?  Right?  I think I told the story when I was here last about when we were working on A Few Good Men and  the word hit the news that Magic Johnson was HIV positive.  Oh, no.  Did he sleep with Jenny Gump?  She left a bunch of dead grass footprints.  Tell her to put her shoes on a forest.  Don't have sex with her.  She's a waitress with AIDS.  Dead grass footprints. 
[02:44:30]  Every time she steps on the lawn, every time she steps on the lawn, she kills it.  This is dead grass footprints.  Dead grass footprints.  Dead grass footprints.  You can see the Robinson problems doing that one.  All right.  So Magic Johnson had just announced his AIDS.  Yeah, so Matt, he announced he had HIV.  Oh, yeah.  So it was announced.  You want us to tell your story?  I'm sitting back and being entertained by it.  So, you know, we have a Lakers authority and Jack Nicholson on the set. 
[02:45:00]  And one by one, I don't know if you remember what the temperature was in the United States,  if not the world around, when HIV hit Magic Johnson.  Because then it was not only a high-profile celebrity, but it was a heterosexual.  And it was really the first giant news of, oh, fuck, nobody's safe kind of reaction.  You know, and also the fact that it was magic and he's so high-profile with the family and the wife and everything. 
[02:45:30]  So everybody from the crew, one by one, throughout the course of the day, was going by Jack and saying,  what the fuck?  What does this mean, you know?  So, as we're walking out of working on one particular scene.  Walking, not walking.  And going back.  Going, walking back to the trailer.  I don't know about you, Jay, but when I'm around these giant, giant fucking stars like Nicholson,  I don't try to engage them in a conversation.  I always feel like, leave them alone.  Leave them the fuck alone.  Do you really? 
[02:46:00]  I make them.  Oh, yeah.  I have to prove to myself, like, confront your fears.  Hey, Tom, how are you?  Well, you probably get a better story out of it because of that.  So I'm leaving.  We're walking back to the trailer.  In this particular moment, it's just Jack and I walking back to our separate trailers.  But we're kind of walking side by side in a way.  And so there's nobody around for the first time all fucking day.  And he starts talking to himself.  It's surreal.  It's fucking surreal.  It's just fucking surreal.  And he gets to his trailer, puts his hand on the door like he's going to walk inside. 
[02:46:30]  He stops, turns back around, and he looks at me and he goes, you want to know surreal?  And I'm like, is the world freezing right now?  Is this happening?  I'm looking around if anybody else is going to witness.  So he says, I'm doing this picture Chinatown.  Fuck me.  The stories are the greatest thing ever.  It's ever been said by any human being.  Right, right, right.  I'm doing this picture Chinatown, and I'm rehearsing this scene with John Huston.  And you have to understand the man was more important to me than my own father at that point.  And I would have put a bullet in my dad's eye if that's what John wanted me to do. 
[02:47:00]  So we're rehearsing this scene, and I look over his shoulder about 50 yards away.  I see his daughter, Angelica, coming to visit the set.  And I had just started banging her a couple of weeks before.  Oh, shit.  And I hadn't figured out a way to tell the old man, you know, and I didn't want to crush him.  And she's coming to visit, and it's going to get ugly, and what am I going to say?  And again, I would have killed her if that's what he wanted.  So as I'm thinking about all this nonsense, and I come back into the rehearsal, 
[02:47:30]  it's right when John says his line to me, which is,  Mr. Giddes, are you sleeping with my daughter?  Now that's surreal.  And he spins around and walks into his trailer, and I'm there literally with a diaper full of shit.  Just, can you believe this fucking happened?  What?  Wow.  That's a chilling Nicholson.  That's an amazing, that's really incredible.  That's the real thing.  That's the second best I've ever seen.  That isn't the Dana Carvey version. 
[02:48:00]  Hey, so I'm on the set, and he comes over, and I go,  here's Johnny, and I hit him with an axe.  Dude, that was fucking, that's the best Nicholson I've ever heard.  That was one of the best things I've ever heard.  That's the best Nicholson I've ever heard anybody do.  But you want to do the relaxed one, you know what I mean?  If you're going to do it, get into the conversation.  The best is when comics, like shitty guys do it,  and if they're bald, and they still pull back their hair.  Oh, God damn, yes.  Jesus Christ, man.  That's pretty good.  That's Barry Katz Nicholson. 
[02:48:30]  Yes.  What the fuck is going on?  That's if Jack Torrance was losing clients.  See, now, the weird thing for me is that's Jack's fucking story,  and I don't think that, you know, he's told many people,  and I felt weird at first putting it in the book,  and I went, fuck that.  That happened to me.  Yeah, of course.  So I have to fuck you.  When's the last time Jack called you?  Exactly.  Good point.  Imagine, though, if that's the story he tells everyone  that he gets alone for a second to make them go, 
[02:49:00]  holy shit.  That'd be awesome.  Because that is an awesome fucking story.  That's ridiculous.  It's ridiculous.  Yeah.  You should have said to him, though,  I got another one.  When he went back into the trailer,  you should have said, come on, Jack,  just give me one, here's Johnny.  But he should have said it as who?  Um, here's Johnny.  Hey, maybe you can take that axe  and chop the AIDS out of your wife, Forrest.  You're almost slipping into a Johnny Carson with that.  Yeah, I know.  I'll take one day's wolf.  That's Rich Little doing Johnny Carson. 
[02:49:30]  None of them sound like anybody.  I just said that to somebody.  Jim Norton showed up.  No good jokes had been sent.  You don't like the Rich Little?  Doll's eyes.  You like the Rich Little?  It all sounds like Nixon to me.  He was always a great technician,  but he wouldn't know funny  if you hit him in the face  with a comedy shovel.  But he stunk at Inspector Clouseau  and he did a long Clouseau piece one time  and I was embarrassed for him.  I'm like, will you shut up?  Yeah.  Fucking awful.  There's a couple stories about him in the book, actually, 
[02:50:00]  because when I was 17,  I interrupted one of his shows  at the big theater in San Francisco  where I grew up  and I went down to the stage  dressed as Columbo  and interrupted his show.  No.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I must have loved that.  And he brought me up on stage  which was not at all in my mind's plan.  Right.  I was just going to get acknowledgement  from who he was the best at that point.  Yes, he was.  You were hoping for indifference.  I really was, Eddie.  I was hoping for him to give me the hard hat.  You walked around as Peter Falk at 17? 
[02:50:30]  At his show.  I went to his show dressed as Peter Falk.  Wow.  For the sole purpose of getting a nod from him,  like, hey, that's good.  But I would imagine you've done that a few times as a kid.  Oh, no, no.  I've been doing the impression,  but just not in public.  You know?  Right, right.  Like fucking Frank Gorshin.  Exactly.  You're just in front of everybody.  Right, who is this annoying fuck?  Yeah.  What was the first impression you did?  Me or Kevin?  What was the first impression?  How old?  You know, I was probably 15 
[02:51:00]  and making fun of the football coach in high school, you know?  It's always something you know.  Yeah, yeah.  And actually, I'm doing it.  Did you do him well?  I'm doing it.  Oh, my classmates are falling out loud.  Of course, right?  Right.  And then while I'm doing it,  Kevin was always a real cut up.  I see in their eyes that they're freaking out.  Like a monster's coming up from behind me,  and sure enough, I get put into a headlock, 
[02:51:30]  and I hear the coach's voice whisper in my ear,  who's clearly the one who's got me in the headlock,  I heard about it, and I don't think it's funny.  Oh, man.  As literally I'm passing out, I'm thinking,  I can probably do Marlon Brando.  He'll never get me in a headlock.  So then it was whoever the people at the time were,  Marlon Brando, Nixon, you know.  So what did Rich Little do when he brought you on stage?  Did he give you a...  He said, he said, what's the problem, Lieutenant?  You know, well, he came to the side of the stage first  and talked to me a little bit and said,  well, ladies and gentlemen, look at Lieutenant Clement. 
[02:52:00]  He puts a mic in my face.  Oh, that's nice.  Because he couldn't fill the hour.  Exactly.  Exactly.  What would we do?  What would you do?  I mean, I often think about it ever since.  If someone dressed up as one of the characters  and came to one of my shows,  I'd say, get this fucking guy out of here.  Yeah, until I'm doing the evolution.  Yeah.  Sorry.  So no, so he came over and said,  what's the problem, Lieutenant?  I said, well, here's the thing.  Rich, the missus and me have been planning  to come to the show for six months.  At the last second, she gets ill can't come  and she told me that if I don't get your autographs, 
[02:52:30]  she's not letting me back in the house.  So he says, well, come on upstage, Lieutenant,  and up on stage, and then we trade.  And then that's where he chooses to use  like a heckler comeback line.  This guy better watch out  or I'll do Rin Tin Tin and he'll be the tree.  He said that?  He said that.  So, so, all right, date.  That's a good one.  Date yourself with the Rin Tin Tin.  Rin Tin Tin with the 40s.  What the fuck?  Wow.  Why, that's a good one.  It's a famous dog.  He could have said Lassie.  Or he could have said Mr. Ed. 
[02:53:00]  Yeah.  Why would Mr. Ed piss on a tree?  How about this?  I'll be Mr. Ed and you can be that guy from Seattle.  I'll be Mr. Ed, you'll be Kenneth Pinion.  So I thought when the show was over,  he was going to take me to show business, you know,  because he said, come back after the show  and I'll give you an autograph.  Come back, kid.  Yeah, come backstage.  And then what happened?  He raped my mouth.  And then he raped my mouth.  And that was my introduction to show business.  Ta-da!  So you went back. 
[02:53:30]  That's really offensive to Moths.  Oh, so I go back.  Moths do a lot of things for us.  They help us chew and talk and communicate.  They don't help you talk, by the way.  No, not always.  Did you ever see him again?  Well, yeah, so backstage I go  and there's like already 30 people in line, right?  And so the kid who dresses up like Columbo  walks down to the stage in the middle of his act.  Do you think that kid, A, walks up to the front of the line,  says, I'm here to see Mr. Little?  Or B, gets in the back of the fucking line.  Oh, you go to the front of the line.  You're a fucking...  I went to the back of the line.  Peter Ford.  Yeah, of course.  I went to the back of the line. 
[02:54:00]  Oh, you did go back.  Yeah, because now I'm myself.  Yeah, yeah.  So I get up there and it's like an assembly line.  He's meeting a person.  Hi, what's your name, Steve?  The guy's on his left.  He's like, hi, what's your name, Steve?  And he signs autograph, passes them over to his right  and he keeps the line moving, signing autographs, right?  So then when I'm in this assembly line,  hey, what's your name?  Mary, hi, I'm Mary.  Thanks for coming on the show.  Hey, oh, hey, here he is.  What's your name?  And I said, Kevin.  And he signs the thing.  Nice, good job.  And I'm shuffled off to Buffalo.  That's it.  That was it.  That's your moment.  It crushed me like a fucking walnut.  I thought we were going to get on the plane  and go to show business.  Of course. 
[02:54:30]  You were on your way.  You were going to be a part of the act.  He brought me on stage.  Oh, he thought he was going to be in the act.  Forrest, why does anybody laugh at that big-nosed trunk?  He's not funny.  Did you ever tell Rich Lowe that story?  No.  After he got famous?  I saw him at the Tonight Show  and I just asked him if he remembered,  like a hundred years ago,  if he remembered the kid who was dressed up as Columbo  and he insisted that he did remember, of course.  He didn't know it was me.  He hadn't put it together at that point.  That was after a few good men, suspects and all that. 
[02:55:00]  He probably did remember that.  How often did that happen to him in his fucking...  You know, I probably went to him once.  All right, listen.  We should take a quick break here.  Kevin Pollick is here.  How I Sought My Way to the Middle is his book.  A lot of stories in here.  Secrets and stories from stage screen and interwebs.  And look, you got Hanks and Martin and Cruz  praising your book right on the front cover.  Order that book!  You earned it!  And Jay Moore, where are you?  The governor's next weekend, right?  No, this weekend.  This weekend.  I'm going to make the Italians laugh. 
[02:55:30]  Yeah, out there.  Jay Moore's.  Across the street from Balls.  Jay Moore's.  Over in Levittown.  Jay Moore's is legendary.  He got me pregnant.  I'm building an ark with my cousin Pancake and Ruby G.  We're doing a little break  and we'll continue with Jay Moore and Peter Falk.  Wait, I got to go in.  Peter Falk, hello.  Jesus.  Kevin Pollick.  Peter Falk, who is he?  Also dead!  Who is he fucking call him?  Who is he fucking take us out, you piece of shit?  Do you want to get off to the world's number one cyber stuff?

Yeah, I'm good.  I'll go, go, go, go.  This is the Opinetry Show.  Show, show.  I'd rather be here, I'd rather be here with, I'd rather be here with an animal. 
[02:57:30]  Where's your microphone?  Hey, Eddie, you're missing your song here.  I didn't hear them.  Did you guys watch the final table of the World Series of Poker main event? 
[02:58:00]  I didn't see it.  No, why would we do that?  I know you were doing very well at one point.  Oh, you were?  I finished the final because it was the final nine, but out of 6,598, I made it to 134.  That's really good.  Which was deeper than any celeb jaguars.  We were starting to get these delusions like, I could go all the way here.  No, no, I knew I couldn't, actually, but I was shocked that I was still fucking there.  But I went in for the final nine for like a half hour to call some hands in the announcer's booth.  Oh, that's cool.  Can I ask a poker question? 
[02:58:30]  Please.  What if you just sit there and fold for three straight days?  Wouldn't that ensure that you'd make it?  You'd probably get a lot of laundry done.  Almost the third spit take of the morning.  Kevin, I love this chipper.  They take your blinds.  As it goes around in orbit, you have to put in like an ante.  They call it a blind.  So they would just keep blinding you off until...  And even if you lasted for a while, you wouldn't have a stack left to even get one hand.  But what about a day?  Just the first day?  The first day you can go through.  Some people do kind of, yeah.  If you did fold the first day, you would guarantee yourself making it to day two. 
[02:59:00]  Yeah.  With such a short stack, though, you're right.  Yeah, you stack, you're fucking, you've got to play the game.  What about Valley?  Oh my God, poker chips are so grouty.  Fucking, I hate Valley Gym.  And hates Valley Gym.  I hate Valley Gym.  And why does Bobby hate chipper so much?  Because Bob, on an intellectual level, is an equal to chip.  You got chip, you coffee.  You know what I would love to do sometime is a talking walking with Chipper.  That would be a fucking wet dream for me. 
[02:59:30]  We could do fucking battling walkings or something.  My mother always said, Chipper, sometimes you sound, go outside, Chipper, and do the voices.  Why outside?  Because a friend, she had a couple of friends of color who would help her lay down the rug in her bedroom.  So she would say, go outside, Chipper, do the voices, and come back later.  Men, friends of color?  Yeah.  Really?  They all look like Paul Benjamin.  Sure.  Yeah, he was English from Escape from Alcatraz. 
[03:00:00]  That's a pretty reference, Chip.  My mother said, I loved him at across 110th Street.  Chip Miller.  Chuck and Chip Miller.  Kevin, so Kevin has to leave because he's doing a TV, but his book, plug his book properly.  What TV are you doing?  Yes.  I'm doing the Katharine Choda.  Oh, wow.  Choda.  In 20 minutes. 
[03:00:30]  You'll have fun with that show.  But I wanted to just honestly say, I am utterly devoted to the show on a daily basis.  I cannot fucking live without it.  Honestly, guys, you guys are crushing it every fucking day.  Goddamn.  And I'm loving it to death and have now for a while, and honestly, just so you know, I'm a nutty fan.  Well, I'm glad I was here finally for your appearance.  Last time I had a very important court ticket thing.  Ticket out of?  Actually, it was jury duty.  Yeah.  And I went in and the guy said, ha, ha, don't worry about it.  Brought me in the back and fucking signed something and I was off. 
[03:01:00]  Yeah.  It was great.  I love being moderately known by a few people.  Exactly.  That's about it.  You know how I got through that, though?  The security guy, I go in and, you know, you're not allowed to carry firearms in a court.  So you've got to go up to the court guy and go, you know, I'm packing.  Packing heat.  You have a license to carry?  And then the guy goes, no, I carry it legal.  But the way you've got to say it.  No, of course I am.  It's three years in prison if you're not.  The way you've got to say it is you walk up to him and you go, I got a gun. 
[03:01:30]  I got a gun.  You yell it when you're running the door.  I got a gun.  I'll execute every last motherfucking one of you.  Yeah, maybe you should take your gun, Wendy.  Oh, God damn.  You're terrible.  Kevin and I.  Johnny's got a gun.  Jimmy running away with the last fucking three hours.  Not even close.  The impression is just fly out of him.  What was that? 
[03:02:00]  You said, here's me.  Is that right?  Oh, oh.  Chip gets real nervous around Carson.  You're nervous around Carson?  Yeah.  He doesn't know Johnny Dyer.  He got a little meta.  Fuck it.  My mother used to watch him.  She would always say, Chip, get out of the room.  Sidney Poitier's on.  Mother wants to watch him alone.  Chip, what was your mother's name?  Dolores.  Why are you getting mad?  Yeah, why are you arguing with me? 
[03:02:30]  She's a wonderful woman.  She's a saint.  So these men, they come and they help your mother lay down the carpet?  Yeah, and fix the floorboards in her bedroom because it was always broken and warped.  How do they fix them?  They would lay down there.  They would make sure that they would just bang up and down on them until they were all nailed in or something.  So you wouldn't see it, but you'd hear it.  I'd be out in the bushes sometimes.  My mother would say, Chip, the blinds are open.  Get out of there.  You'd peek into your mom's window?  Oh, Chip. 
[03:03:00]  That's a guilty face.  Oh, Chip.  Now wouldn't I be out taking berries?  Was your mother a fan of Gary Sinise?  Oh.  No.  She liked...  No, she liked...  She liked...  She liked Bubba.  She would always...  She cries every time he died because she said,  I bet he has a big black Alabama cock, Chip.  Ain't no shrimp in that, Bubba.  I'll expect this exact same thing over Kathleen and Hoda. 
[03:03:30]  Oh, of course.  Hey, plug the book.  How I slept my way in the middle.  I really did.  What the fuck?  Yeah, he's got to go.  I mean, I'm one of those.  The great Kevin Pollack.  I actually am bummed we didn't have this because I would read it out of respect for Kevin before the interview.  I'll be back.  But, yeah, I'll have it read by the time you come back.  I'll have it read.  And, of course, your Twitter.  I follow you on Twitter, and I love it.  Very funny.  I follow you guys as well.  We'll keep that up.  Yes.  And we'll take the relationship going.  That you renewed your son's a bitch.  I know, right?  Thank God.  Thank God.  A lot of money. 
[03:04:00]  Not very, right?  See that, though?  $400 or $500 a week.  You said, you sound like the guy that just signed a contract.  Anthony was on, like, an R and N-bomb rant.  Somebody re-upped.  I went down the hall.  The record shows that you went down the hall, Jay Moore.  And Anthony was talking about the same person.  Yeah, it was.  All right, Kevin.  Get the fuck out of here.  Kevin Pollack.  Thank you, man.  Say goodbye.  He's walking. 
[03:04:30]  Goodbye.  That's all we get from you.  That's perfect, man.  He's here two hours.  He did 20 seconds of walking.  He was fucking fantastic.  You know what it is?  Don't talk with your mouth full.  I'm eating jerky.  Yeah, of course you are.  On the radio.  You wow what you eat.  Very good.  There's a story in the book, actually.  One of the first early tonight shows I did, Lenna was the guest host, right?  So he says, come up to the house and run the spot, and we'll work on it.  So I was comfortable enough, because he had several gatherings at Numa.  So I go up to the house, and he said, all right, so let me see. 
[03:05:00]  What do you get?  So I do the first thing, and it's top load.  It's a Peter Fogg.  It's a crusher, you know, and I finish it, and he goes, oh, okay.  So does that normally work when you do it in your act?  Oh, so that's what I expect.  If I come here and I try to do my little monkey voice, I literally expect.  You can do a monkey?  Do a monkey.  I literally expect, okay, so that normally works?  Oh, wow.  He did that to you.  Yeah, one after another.  That's also a great J.  That's a great fucking J. 
[03:05:30]  Wow.  It's a conversational J.  The conversational stuff, honestly, I know he has to leave it.  That's fucking awesome, man.  It's great.  I said awesome.  Because everyone does the over-the-top shit.  Go, Kevin.  Go, go, go.  Love you guys.  Thank you, man.  Good seeing you, man.  How I Slept My Way to the Middle, Kevin Pollock's new book.  Thank you, Kevin.  We'll see you soon, buddy.  Watch a very different interview with Kevin if you want to tune in.  No kidding.  Yeah.  Kathy Lee and Hoda.  Hoda.  Hey, if you need Gary Sinise, call me and I'll do it over the phone and we'll go back and  forth.  We'll start a riff.  Hey, Forrest, who are these two drunken cunts? 
[03:06:00]  And by that, I mean my fat Asian wife and your A-Z one, not Hoda.  A-Z.  Yeah, Hoda.  Who are these bitches you're looking at?  Who is that bitch?  This is just on the screen.  It's people's bikini bodies.  But are they-  Here's Rihanna.  I don't know why anybody thinks she's hot.  She looks like Earl Campbell.  You don't like Rihanna.  What's to like?  Oh, shit.  That's what's her name.  I hate those fucking surf shirts that people wear all the time now.  It's like, look, if you're a fucking fatso with tits, you got to get out there and own 
[03:06:30]  it and lose them eventually.  You're like, dude.  But like every kid in the world, they're like, everyone just like, you know what?  I don't have to get in shape.  I'll just wear a fucking board shirt.  Oh, yeah.  That's what we call selling out.  You got to show him Stone Cold E2.  Stone Cold Steve Austin has nothing to do with this whatsoever.  You got to see this, though.  I like to have to show downtown Sam Roberts.  You got primetime.  Primetime.  Downtown. 
[03:07:00]  I've loved Eddie Vedder being part of the show today.  I know it made Opie laugh the hardest of the entire two hour runs.  I know what, I know one syllable word that made you go fucking and no one else heard  it.  Shit.  Do you remember what it was?  Uh-uh.  I just hate to talk and I go, bugs.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, bugs.  You know what, dude?  I wear my board shirt.  I go to Brazil.  I get pulled over.  I'm speaking fucking Spanish.  And the fucking cops, dude, I get Patrice Lampin.  I got my coffee. 
[03:07:30]  And the cops are like, hey, you know what, dude?  I know that dog is in the car.  You know what, dude?  Dude, I'm fucking fishing in my blow-up raft with a chair in it.  You know what, dude?  You got your friends.  You got your health, dude.  So what if you don't have lights?  Where are you?  Chicago, dude.  Yeah.  I got stuck in Chicago.  In what?  An airplane hanging, dude.  I couldn't get out.  You're a fucking jerk.  You know that, dude?  Oh, yeah.  You're a fucking jerk. 
[03:08:00]  Oh, yeah.  They remind me of an impression I forgot to do.  Oh.  God damn it.  Oh, no.  I wish I had glasses for this.  Jimmy's at Buffalo December 28th.  End of the year.  He's doing New Year's Eve up there.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  This is serious, De Niro, and he makes like a speech?  Yeah.  Not De Niro.  You know, the people of New York remember me as a bull who would rage.  But now I'm raging at poverty. 
[03:08:30]  I hate that shit.  I fucking hate that.  Stupid heavy breathing.  Shut up.  Shut up, Bob.  I think, Anthony, what do you hate?  Would celebrities do their thing?  Yes.  Can't stand when they do like that.  When they incorporate something from their career into a pitch.  What's worse to me is, okay, my rule is if you have to say your name, you're not a celebrity spokesman.  Oh, right.  That's true.  If you have to say, hi, I'm Sarah McLachlan. 
[03:09:00]  I'm not Susan Sarandon at all.  And hundreds of thousands of dogs and cats are killed.  So are fucking people, you assholes.  How many homeless people did you drive past to save that fucking cat?  You know what?  Next time you see a veteran laying in his own piss, wearing a Gary Payton Lakers jersey,  show him your new cat and tell him he doesn't itch anymore.  And that veteran will tell you you're doing God's work.  Right.  Work.  Work.  There was one.  There was one. 
[03:09:30]  We got it.  Here, to play Stone Cold E.T.  Stone Cold E.T.  And I just want to hold it for a couple of white castles to go.  I'm so sorry.  Can you repeat that again?  I said Stone Cold E.T.  Would like a couple of cheeseburgers and maybe a drink.  And I'd like to get out here as soon as possible.  And that's the bomb line.  Hey, do you want to follow up?  I can't understand anything.  Look how he's got to look down at the shift knob. 
[03:10:00]  Watch him drive the car.  Just pull up what's that?  Full screen.  Just pull up to the first window.  Watch how he drives.  Watch how he's got to look.  He's got to look.  Stone Cold E.T.  And I just want to order a couple of cheeseburgers and maybe a drink.  And I'd like to get out here as soon as possible.  And that's the bomb line.  Hey, do you want to follow up?  I can understand anything.  He can't see the gear shift.  Okay, you want to go, Tony T.  He can't see.  His head looks like DeRosa's dick. 
[03:10:30]  Oh, that's what I'm going to do.  Okay.  He's driving.  This should have way more views.  Stone Cold E.T.  Why E.T.?  He's got to run with him.  Everything. 
[03:11:00]  There's nothing not available.  Every fucking moment.  Holy shit.  He's doing the E.T. finger.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Please go and Stone Cold E.T. if you're listening to this right now.  Please, if you can hear my voice.  Fuck acid water.  Go to the Stone Cold E.T.  If you go to a shelter.  Just plug the shit in the shelter.  Everybody that needs heat.  Oh, my God. 
[03:11:30]  He's just staring into the window waiting.  He's just waiting.  All right, here's your phone.  This is Stone Cold E.T.  And I want to order a couple of cheeseburgers.  And that's the bomb line.  Because you know Stone Cold E.T.  Like to come to White Castle.  Or a couple of cheeseburgers.  To fill me up before I whoop some ass.  Give me a hell yeah.  If you're down with Stone Cold E.T.  Oh, no.  Yeah. 
[03:12:00]  With Stone Cold E.T.  Like swooping ass.  With Stone Cold E.T.  Rides a bicycle.  I ride it long.  I ride it hard.  Just like the Texas Roundsnake.  When he's done whooping Vince McMahon's ass.  And he's like, oh, hell yeah.  What'd you say, E.T.?  What?  What'd you say, E.T.?  What?  I said, I want to order two cheeseburgers.  And that's the bottom line.  Because no Stone Cold like a Little White Castle burger. 
[03:12:30]  With a Little Onion.  With a Little Meat.  Because he's nothing like Stone Cold Steve Austin.  Eating those Little White Castle burgers.  You know, Stone Cold is like a Little White Castle action.  Well, I'm busy fighting off aliens.  When I'm busy being the crap out of Will Smith.  In Independence Day.  Or being my fanatic robot.  Stone Cold E.T.  Is gonna whoop some ass.  Give me a hell yeah. 
[03:13:00]  Oh, hell yeah.  Stone Cold E.T.  Is gonna whoop some ass.  Oh, that's the bottom line.  Look down again.  Hell yeah.  He just drives away.  I'm telling you, isn't that great?  There's no...  Oh, I can't...  Oh, my God.  Fucking hilarious.  In every video.  There's like a six second chunk where you're like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  That start to finish might be the funniest thing I've ever seen on YouTube. 
[03:13:30]  Oh, hell yeah.  It's all muffled because of his mask, which is great.  And the mask moves when he talks because of the air.  Look down, like you said.  He has to look straight down.  Can't see.  He can't see through his face.  He looks like Ackbar.  Fucking great, man.  This is dissident.  Bugs.  That's what makes me laugh all day.  Oh, bugs.  Fucking Jay Moore killing it today.  Love it.  Love it. 
[03:14:00]  Are you around for a while?  You're gonna be doing some radio with us, right?  I'm here for the month.  Come on, where are you staying?  My secret location.  I could tell you where I'm staying, but then, of course, I'd have to kill you.  I like when front men think, like, fucking old hack shit.  It's funny.  But we're drunk in the audience, like, yeah, tripping on mushroom caps and a joint and six  beers, like, yeah.  Hey, Long Island.  Look at the fucking asshole.  It's so good to be here.  My age, it's good to be anywhere. 
[03:14:30]  Yeah!  Fucking Eddie's the best.  Fucking guy!  Fucking Eddie, man.  Fucking best.  I don't even know what this shit is.  How do I get out of here, Sam Roberts?  What is that?  That's a guy that gets hit with a soccer ball.  Westside Dave Roberts.  Well, the guy that walks into the pole is pretty funny.  Eastside.  News anchor fell compilation.  They got the lady with the busts.  Watch this guy hit the fucking pole.  He's trying to...  Oh, this guy.  He's trying to interview this guy.  Watch this.  This is so stupid.  You got the volume.  X out.  Good radio.  Lots of visuals. 
[03:15:00]  Oh, the big fucking...  Fucking break.  Walks right into a pole.  They do a slow-mo on it.  You can tell in slow motion by the sound.  And his glasses knock off.  What a fucking dick.  Up here in my tree.  Newspapers matter not to me.  No.  No.  Election day tomorrow, by the way. 
[03:15:30]  Who are you voting for, Ant?  Who you got?  I'm still undecided.  You're still undecided, are you?  What do they call it?  A low-intelligent...  What do they call it?  Low-information vote?  No, not you.  Specifically.  You don't...  What do they call them?  Oh, here comes Uncle Paul.  No, it's Edgar.  This is Edgar.  Oh, Edgar?  Have you been touched by Edgar yet?  Yeah, I liked him.  Oh, you don't mind Edgar touching you?  I thought it was Uncle Paul.  I hate Edgar.  No, they're very different.  Why?  And there's Eugene, too. 
[03:16:00]  Yeah, but mostly it's Edgar.  Yeah.  Yeah, we don't see Eugene a lot.  No, Eugene's very strange.  Uh, I'm voting for Mitt Romney.  Shut up.  Isn't that amazing?  I bet I surprised a lot of people with that one.  Oh, no, you didn't.  My secret ballad.  Yeah.  Was that Eugene or Edgar?  That's Edgar.  That's Edgar.  Edgar, uh, makes the...  Stop!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Ha ha ha!  Edgar makes the same face as Jack Lugman.  Oh.  He was Queen T. 
[03:16:30]  Queen T.  Talking about a murder.  Murder.  The worst.  I gotta tell you something, um, and I will just say this to offset any of Michael Moore's  crap, because I know there are a lot of listeners around the country.  Mm.  Um, and this is just from me, and not necessarily a reflection of the Opie and Anthony radio show.  Or a reflection.  Get out and vote, especially, uh, you Republicans.  Get out.  If you're registered to vote, and you don't vote tomorrow, you're being an asshole.  Talking about the whole country.  Anthony's a left-wing Hollywood douchebag. 
[03:17:00]  No!  No, I'm talking...  That's what I get on my Twitter feed.  No matter what I write about Christie, or liking Nixon, you fucking liberal...  No, me.  They always say.  I'm like, have you read my feed?  I say, just get the fuck out there and vote Mitch Romney.  Get Obama out of here.  Please!  I've had it with him.  Uh, in January 1st, you'll all have it with him when those taxes go up, boy.  Let me tell ya.  Tell us how you really feel.  Ah. 
[03:17:30]  I want to tell us how you really feel, Anthony.  I think Chip was right.  So if you are registered to vote as a Republican, and you sit home and don't vote, I'm gonna be  very angry with you.  Get up, take the fucking five minutes it'll take to go and cast your fucking vote.  Please, how come you're not called Pearl Jelly?  I love Chip so much.  He's like a brother to me.  Chip did a lot for the country.  Chip, uh...  Eddie Vedder loves Chip.  Of course he does. 
[03:18:00]  How come you're not called Diamond Jam?  God damn, one of the funniest men you'll ever meet.  And you're gonna wanna check out Chip or Tiffy on, on YouTube.  I think that's what all the kids are using.  Hey, how come you didn't call your group Pearl Bailey?  Holy shit.  Chip's putting them away.  There's a lot of Pearl Jam jokes, Chip.  I never run out of them.  My mother would always say, Chip or Lamar's gonna help me fix the floor. 
[03:18:30]  Go do your Pearl Jam jokes in the living room.  Give us another one.  Chip's mother, Dolores, is a great woman.  She's here tonight.  She's at Stone's mother.  Dolores, this is for you.  This is an elderly woman behind a counter in a small town.  Yeah, why is she behind a counter?  Why didn't she work in the aisle or something?  I was like, what the fuck?  God damn, Chip is a real American.  If you're gonna get out and vote, you could do it.  You do, because we all have free will. 
[03:19:00]  But you might wanna write in, Chip.  How come you didn't call your band Pearl Necklace or something like this?  There's a whole bunch of cum on you.  Oh, no.  That's exactly it.  Chip, get a towel.  Lamar gave me a Pearl Necklace.  Oh, yeah.  Come on, Chip.  You gotta clean up your mom after the workers leave?  Yeah, she would lay there and say, rub it into my skin, Chip.  I wanna look younger.  Chip had to rub the cum into his mom.  No, it was lotion. 
[03:19:30]  She'd say, Chip, rub it over my neck pimples.  Rub it over my skin tags.  Chip, you know, we used to be called Mookie Blaylock.  My mother loved him.  She would sometimes, I got a little bat from Shea Stadium.  And I'm like, Ma, where is that?  She goes, I'm hiding it somewhere special watching Mookie chip off.  Mookie Blaylock.  I remember Dolores used to watch the Hawks down at the Omni Center when she was in Atlanta.  She traveled to see Kevin Willis. 
[03:20:00]  I'd watch Daryl Strawberry.  Dolores did not like Daryl Strawberry.  I remember it was a dire Red Sox fan.  We never could bring her over to the dark side.  My mother liked Patrick Ewing.  She'd always say, look at the hands on that guy, Chipper.  You know what that means?  I'd go big gloves, Ma.  That's a funny one.  I wasn't kidding.  See, because your mom probably meant something else.  No, she didn't.  I saw Patrick Ewing.  I saw nine turnovers again. 
[03:20:30]  But that's just me.  That's just me.  My mother would always say that.  When they would say there's a turnover, she'd go, he could turn me over any day, Chipper.  We love Dolores so much.  Well, we got a brand new song that we want to debut for you guys.  Don't be an Anthony show for Chipper's mother, Dolores.  How come your name's not Eddie Gourmet?  You lost me, Chipper.  I'm sorry.  I swear to God, sometimes.  When you're up all night with this guy, he's got so many. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah.  Fuck it for all, Jim.  Why Gourmet, Chipper?  Why do you explain to all the people at Long Island why?  Because if you took one day out, it would be 80, cocksucker.  Oh, whoa.  Relax.  That escalated.  What the anger?  That escalated quickly.  Relax.  Chipper, I think you killed the man with a trident.  Now I'm doing Eddie Vetter doing Will Ferrell and Anchorman.  That's good.  You might want to get what they call a safe house and lay low.  Hey, how come you're not going to listen to this song or something? 
[03:21:30]  A fucking chippy Vetter.  Dolores is here.  Earth, Wind, and Fire is our opening act.  Dolores insisted she comes on board and join us.  Ah, Chip.  She's going to do Earth, Wind, and Fire.  My mother loved them.  Earth couldn't be here, so it's Earth.  It's a...  Fucking J.  What happened?  It's a...  We couldn't.  Steve Gorman of the Black Crows told me, him on the podcast, 
[03:22:00]  told me that they went to a blues club with Robert Plant,  and in the blues club, it was Checkerboard Lounge in Chicago.  It was the Black Crows and Robert Plant.  And they go,  We got a very special guest in the house tonight.  Please welcome, all the way from England,  Led Zeppelin.  Stand up, lad.  Holy shit.  The man that brought blues to America.  Come on, lad.  Stand up, lad.  Stand up, lad.  Oh, you can't.  Oh, he just stood up and waved,  and they were like,  This is the fucking craziest moment in...  Chip's mom loved the blues clubs.  We'd take her all the time to go see Buddy Guy. 
[03:22:30]  She liked Buddy Guy,  and of course, John Lee Hooker before he passed.  Rest his soul.  She would always say,  He could muddy my waters any time, Chipper.  She didn't know.  That's true.  That's what she said all the time.  Yeah, she said BB.  She goes,  I bet that stands for big and black.  I was like,  What do you mean, Ma?  She said,  Mind your manners, Chipper.  I never understood that,  because you were just asking her a regular question.  And she'd always sometimes,  Well, I don't want it.  It's family business.  Speaking of family, 
[03:23:00]  this is why I go home.  I never liked sweet potatoes,  but mom's friends did.  Oh, boy.  The type of food that they...  Collard greens.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's nothing wrong with the floor.  Yes, there was.  It was broken.  Always broken.  Yeah.  What is that?  It's got to go find gas.  I got some.  I'll fart in your car.  See you tomorrow.  No, no, no, no.  You got to get your plug in there, Chipper.  I'm going to be performing... 
[03:23:30]  How could anyone not like this?  Bobby.  Fucking...  You know what, Dad?  I'll be in Buffalo.  What am I, fucking...  Riding a buffalo on a plane or something?  Oh, God.  That doesn't make sense, Jim.  Yeah, I'll be in Buffalo  like I'm a piece of buffalo shit.  December 28, 29, 30, and 31  in Buffalo.  What's the name of the room,  Chip?  Let them know.  It's the Helium Comedy Club.  Everybody talks like that or something. 
[03:24:00]  All right.  Who's not doing Helium?  That's a good room.  Use the space.  Everybody's so there.  He knows a little bit about comedy.  And I'll be in Addison, Texas  November 15th, 16th, and 17th.  That's when...  J.M.K. got shot.  Who's got the brain in the game  of the middle of the...  Jay Moore's going to be at the  Give It Is.  Give It Is on Long Island this weekend.  Yeah.  Come on out, and if it takes all night, 
[03:24:30]  well, that's all right.  We'll do it.  We'll cross some balls.  I want to take Earth, Zephyr, and Heat  for joining us,  because the original band members  couldn't be here.  We have Earth, Wind, and Heat.  Oh, Obama's still campaigning.  Yeah.  You never can be too sure, Anthony.  Go on.  Please get out to vote.  Don't forget to cast your ballots  and write in Chip Chippen's  and if you're in your side.  Just make it a real democracy,  like tonight.  But tonight is not a democracy. 
[03:25:00]  It's a dictatorship,  a benevolent one,  and I'm your leader, Ed.  Oh, my God.  This is even flow,  and we'll leave you with this.  We should play some fucking Pearl Jam out here.  What do you want to play?  Play Up Here in My Tree.  Up Here in My Tree.  I don't care.  No, you know what?  If I could really request one,  why am I shouting?  Play whatever fucking song you want, Jay Moore.  I would love to hear Habit.  Habit?  That's the fucking real deal. 
[03:25:30]  You know what, Chipper?  All right, we're going to play that.  Habit.  Get out of here.  Did your mother have any habits?  That's all right.  We only have the live version,  but that's fine,  so that means you've got to fucking intro the song  because we're playing the live version.  Jay Moore will be back on the show  in and out in the next few weeks,  so we're looking forward to that.  Look, sometimes something's so good  you can't put it down, you know?  Like this red wine,  or Chipper's mother's affinity  for a man named Lamar.  She had a habit already.  What is she, a nun or something? 
[03:26:00]  Or Chipper's affinity for great, great, great jokes.  One of the great American storytellers of all time.  I can't quit you, Chipper,  I won't check it.  This is Habit.  See it happen to a couple of friends  See it happen in the message it sends  Taken out for what's an obvious thought 
[03:26:30]  Just to see what all the fuss is about  It's not your way  Not your way  Not your way  Another habit says it's in love with you  Another habit says it's long overdue  Another habit like an unwanted friend  I'm so happy with my righteousness  I'm so happy with my righteousness  It's not your way 
[03:27:00]  Not your way  It's not your way  Never thought you'd have it  Never thought you'd have it  Never thought you'd have it 
[03:27:30]  Never thought you'd have it 
[03:28:00]  Speaking as a child of the 90s 
[03:28:30]  Never me  Never you'll  Never me 
[03:29:00]  Never you'll 
[03:29:30]  Here he is  I laughed a lot today 
[03:30:00]  It's after Opie and Anthony live  A lot of voices on this show but I have to tell you  I think this show  Benefits immensely  From having Eddie Vedder  As just somebody who's there the whole time  He doesn't have to pipe up  All the time and maybe he does only stick to  His own thing but just having Eddie Vedder's voice  As a constant on the show  I think helps to  Kind of  Fill out the show a little bit  Just having him say things like bugs 
[03:30:30]  And introing songs that are never gonna play  Stuff like that  I think works  Jay Moore and Kevin Pollack were both in today  Awesome to have him in  I guess  Impressions just make me laugh  It's very cool  When you have  Three great impressionists  Because we get a cornucopia of different guests  You're talking about Jay Moore  You're talking about Kevin Pollack  And of course  Somebody whose impression skills  Have developed over time  As we've been privy to 
[03:31:00]  And that's Jim Norton  Chipper  Well no not just Chipper  You're talking about Gary Sinise  You're talking about  What's his name from Jaws  Valley Jim  You love that Valley character  I do  Why?  It makes you laugh  Is that your one?  Yeah  Sal what's your one character?  I love Quint from Jaws  You like Quint better than any of the characters?  Yeah I'm a huge Jaws fan  I love that movie  You're 22 years old  Yeah my dad like showed me that at a very young age  So do you have things that you like 
[03:31:30]  That your dad didn't show you?  You like Rush?  Yeah  You like Jaws?  Yeah  Is there anything that you've developed on your own?  No no I'm a follower  That's it?  That's it  You don't like anything like  Post 2005?  No I do  Like what?  There's a lot of music  That my dad just would never even listen to  But you know  I don't know  It doesn't sound like it  Our intern's back  Anthony  How was last week for?  You live on Stanton Island?  I do yeah  So are you guys all fucked up? 
[03:32:00]  Yeah it's pretty bad over there  Did your house get hit?  No my house didn't  We're not that close to the water  But we're  Down in Tottenville  It's pretty bad  Do you have power?  Yeah we have power  Wow  But have you been down there where it's bad?  Yeah  Yeah I went down both sides  Yeah  Over the weekend  It's pretty bad  Messed up  Jay Moore  You guys are doing a hell of a job  Yeah  I was just talking about how great Eddie Vedder is on the show  Yeah  Always good for you know  Eddie Vedder to stop by 
[03:32:30]  It reinvigorates when you get some support from an A-lister like Eddie Vedder  But yeah so you guys are all fucked up down there  Yeah it's really bad  Do you know anybody that got caught up in that?  No I know a lot of people that don't have power a lot  But the first day I went down and I took a bunch of pictures down in Highland  And I put them on Facebook  But it's just  That was what you did to help?  Yeah  The first day  Look at this  Yeah  Get some Facebook hits out of this  That's right  That's all you did  You just brought out the digital camera and nothing else 
[03:33:00]  Why not?  You didn't bring any food  The second day I did  Because he got you all those Facebook friends  Yeah  Then I figured I'll help out  I'll give back  Give back a little bit where I took so selfishly originally  Exactly  I see  I donated I did my part  How much did you donate?  30 bucks  $30  What's that going to help?  Well he's an intern  But I was there  What were you doing?  You know  I was helping out  Dropping off to 30?  Exactly  That's not a lot  I would transport stuff from the lower side to up to where it was getting really bad 
[03:33:30]  So you were there for muscle  Exactly  And they needed a lot of muscle  A lot  Too much  Did your girlfriend go with you?  She did not, no  What was she doing?  She was  Hanging out with the guys who work at Foot Locker?  Probably  Or the firemen  Or the  Sexy firemen?  Yeah  Or they had like robberies for firemen  They robbed them at gunpoint  What do you mean?  What happened?  In Staten Island  Firemen  Who did the firemen rob?  No, no  Some crooks tried to rob the firemen at gunpoint  Crooks is what you call them?  Yes  Crooks  Yes  With those glasses  You're going to call people crooks 
[03:34:00]  You really are right out of the 1950s  Crooks  Some crooks  So they held up firemen at gunpoint?  For their uniforms and for like, you know, different stuff so they could go around knocking as firemen and try to get in  What a bunch of scumbags  Yeah, it's bad  Like, why don't you just go rob people at gunpoint?  I know  If you have guns, you don't need to pretend you're firemen  Yeah  The first was the Con Edison people  That was like the first thing  But then they went and they just sold them up 
[03:34:30]  So they held up these people and steal their uniforms  If you have a gun  Yeah  Just knock on the door and be like, I have a gun  Open the door  Exactly  Especially people with no power and there's no, you know, you could easily get in there  But no, they had to do the firemen  Let the firemen do their jobs  Yeah  That's some of the stuff that people aren't, like, you know, really  They're really not reporting about a lot of stuff  Because I guess it really hasn't, I don't know, maybe it hasn't happened as much  Yeah, maybe they're trying to not report so that they're  Copycats  They don't want to encourage anybody  Yeah  But they've got to not pretend it's not happening 
[03:35:00]  I know, it's crazy when I was hearing those stories  And it's just along the whole  And that's there in Staten Island  That's in Staten Island, yeah, absolutely  Wow  Bad  Do they steal the trucks?  I don't know about the trucks  Or just the uniforms  Because I'd imagine it would be very difficult to drive a fire truck  I just wouldn't hold up firemen  Well, you're a nice boy  You probably wouldn't hold up anybody  No  You're a guy who, you know, you just want to intern at Disney World  Exactly  Be an Anthony show  That's it  Have happiness in your life  Exactly  With other people out there, Anthony 
[03:35:30]  And this is the most important lesson that you need to learn  Intern Anthony  Right  Other people just want destruction  Yeah  Roland, would you ever hold up a fireman?  No  At gunpoint?  No  I mean, you're just giving up completely on any sort of moral anything at that point  Yeah  You just have to realize, like, this is the path I've decided to take  I'm a scumbag  And it was supposedly a bunch of them  So  Like, they were like  They heard, oh, this is a great idea  We should keep doing this 
[03:36:00]  Yeah  And the fire station that got robbed at gunpoint is my fire station  Like, the one that's closest to me  What a bunch of animals  So that's why  But I would think you would  If I was a crook  Right  A crook, as you call it  If I was a criminal  Right  If you had a Tommy gun  Yeah, if I had a Tommy gun  But I would  I guess you would do it along where the affected areas were  But they did it more inland  To, I guess, get people that were without power into more nicer neighborhoods or something  Yeah, but you had power  Well, not the first three or four days 
[03:36:30]  Oh, okay  You just got it back  We were out for a while  When did you get it back?  No, a couple days ago  Oh, okay  But my friend just got his  The person who got me into this show  He just got his power back yesterday  That's crazy  I can't believe  But it's weird that they're not reporting it  Because that's  So there's no gas  No gas  And not only  Gas is the worst  Yeah  I went to Pennsylvania  You did?  I did  How far of a drive is that?  It was  I knew one of the casinos over there  And it's 60 miles away 
[03:37:00]  So you're talking about  So I had like 70, 80 miles  I drove  Wow  I got a full tank  I filled up two things  And then I came back  That's when it was really bad  Like now I wouldn't do it  Because I go to Jersey  But like you'd have to  These  That fireman scheme can't last much longer  No, it can't  I really  That's like the downfall of society  Yeah  That's like pure  Anarchy and chaos  Yeah  Yeah, that was definitely the worst  But then you got just gas  And people with no power  And then there's  You know, all this  Like even the first day 
[03:37:30]  Because like you can't even notify people  You know, there's fake firemen out there  We've been robbed  Bah, bah, bah  The first day when I went down  To really see the bad part  Because my friend was white  A block away from Zone A  And we went down to see the bad part  There was this girl like  Brushing off CDs  To kind of see what they were  So I guess if she wanted to take them  Okay  Like she was looking at the titles of them  To see if she wanted to take them  Like there were some CDs  That were washed up  Yeah, yeah  And she was like  Oh, some CDs  Like why would you  Even if they were brand new  You wouldn't want a CD  What are you going to do with it?  It was there 
[03:38:00]  And she would be like  Washing him off  Meanwhile there's people moving  Like full houses  And FEMA  You know  And she's like  Oh, this is Minuto's best album  Right here  This is actually a pretty good record  I'm going to keep this for myself  Or the Pearl Jam album  Right  Oh, this Ice Cube  Actually, this is the edited version  I'm looking for parental advisory  I'm going to throw this back into water  Somebody's  It's bad  It's still very bad  The one good thing about this storm  Is that somebody  The last person to have a CD collection  Lost it  So we can finally move on with our lives 
[03:38:30]  And get into, you know, 2012  Yeah, there is a  I know Jim was asking before  About where he could donate  Or where people could donate  There is a good site  That's not the Red Cross  It's just dealing with Staten Island  I think it's called  HelpingStatenIsland.com  Something like that  And it's a good site  It's not going to help people  Who rob firemen  No, no, that's not going to help  It's not going to help  What if those people don't have power?  Exactly  No, no, no  What if the people robbing the firemen  Don't have power?  You mean the crooks?  Criminals  What if the crooks 
[03:39:00]  The bad cats  Yeah, what if  The fat cats  What if the bad cats  Don't have power?  Right  Then might some of those funds  Go to the crooks?  That's true  That's those son of a bitches  I didn't think of that  Somebody make sure then  That's smart  Before anybody donates any money  Look in houses  If anybody's got  Like a fireman uniform in there  And no fire truck in the driveway  Realize  Yeah  That's not a real fireman  And they're trying  They're crooks  They're crooks  I didn't even think of that  It's wild  You have to think of everything 
[03:39:30]  From every angle  The crooks are always thinking  You know what I mean?  You have to think like a crook  To get past a crook  I wouldn't imagine that in my life  I wouldn't imagine that Staten Island  Would become 1955  Just because of one storm  But apparently  That's what happened  There's all these speakeasies  Popping up  Is that what's happening?  And there's a lot of hooch  Being passed around  Well people saw what was going on  In Atlantic City  And they saw this place  Getting torn up  And they were like  Listen  If Nucky Thompson  Was still in charge  This never would have happened 
[03:40:00]  Yeah exactly  You know what I mean?  If Nucky Thompson  He held Atlantic City  To its best  And if he were in charge  And so Staten Island's  Going like  Well that's what we gotta do  We gotta go back  And they're gonna go even further  You know these crooks and criminals  From 1955 are running around  Wait till the robber barons  Start coming  You know what I mean?  Wait till this starts to become  The roaring 20s  Yeah  And then shit  With the speakeasies  Then shit's gonna go wild  Shit is gonna go wild 
[03:40:30]  You know why?  Cause in the 20s  They did not give a fuck  Cause there were no like  Computers  There were no registries  You could be a sex offender  And be in any neighborhood you want  Yeah  Like you could be a sex offender  You could get caught  You could go to jail  And move right back next door  To that little girl  And you're fine  Cause there was no  It was the 20s  What are they gonna do?  They were so worried about  People sneaking in rum  Yeah  That you know  You could rob firemen  All day long  As long as you didn't have any booze  Yeah that's why my  My grandfather  He was doing the best 
[03:41:00]  During all this  Cause he was born  Oh he's 94  He's 94  So he was born  During that era  So he's okay  In the 20s  He's used to it  In the Great Depression  Yeah  So he lived through the Depression  Oh yeah  So he was a cash now too  What did you say Roland?  Everything's cash now  Everything's cash  We talked about this  We're gonna move to gold bricks  Then ammo  So your grandfather you said  Yeah  Is sitting there going  Wow  A couple gas stations are closed  Right  And a couple of firemen got robbed  Let me tell you something son  It gets a whole lot worse  Yeah 
[03:41:30]  And I'm ready for it  When we tune it back to 1930  Right  Does he have like a bayonet?  Is he ready to go?  I didn't see a bayonet  He was painting during all of this  He didn't give a fuck  He didn't care  Does he have gunpowder ready?  No I don't think so  He was in World War 2  He was  He was in World War 2  But he didn't  Did he kill any Nazis?  Probably  Don't tell Anthony Cumia that  Because it will not  It will not help your career here  You don't want to mention that  If anything you could say  My grandfather was in World War 2  Right  If Anthony asks you which side  He was part of the third rights 
[03:42:00]  Did I say that?  Yes  Because he does  When you tell Anthony  Oh I have a relative  An ancestor relative  Whatever  Who was in World War 2  Follow up question is always  Which side did he fight?  Right  And a lot of people  You'd be like  Oh he was one of us  Right  American  And you'd think  Oh we'll have a party  And celebrate  No  No  Make sure Anthony knows  He was fighting for the enemy  You got it  And don't call him the enemy  You got it  And don't tell him  I said it was the enemy either  Because he doesn't like  That type of shit  Alright  Anthony you're on with Anthony  On After Open Anthony Live 
[03:42:30]  Good morning Sam  The king of the after show  Thank you  I mean that's a terrible title  I'm the only one who hosts the show  I have to say that  Anthony Cumia  Is the best generator impression ever  That's true Anthony  Good point  Anthony Cumia  Was doing an impression  Of a generator earlier today  So we had a generator  We had 150 Christopher Walkins  We had Eddie Vedder  We had  What are some of those  Other impressions we had? 
[03:43:00]  Harvey Keitel  Harvey Keitel  Alan Hawking  All over the place today  It was amazing  Call me up  866-WOW1-WOW  866-969-1969  And let me know what you learned  I was on one of those  Gas stations lines  Yesterday  Friday  I swear  I got online  Thinking it was going to be  You know  An hour or so  And I was listening to the  To the wrestling radio show  That they do here 
[03:43:30]  And thinking  Oh yeah  I'll listen to the rest of this show  And that'll kind of occupy me  It's not a great show  But  If you're waiting on a gas line  At least it's something  Right  So I'm sitting there  And that show ends  And I've barely moved  I went through  That radio show  A podcast  I watched an episode  Of Jimmy Fallon  On Hulu  On my phone  The batteries ran out  And then I just argued  With Jess for about an hour  And finally  Got some petroleum 
[03:44:00]  In my car  It's amazing  What's going on  And this is not even  In an affected area  This is in Westchester  Where the sun's out  And there's cars everywhere  And power was coming back on  Everywhere  I can't imagine  What it must be like  In these areas like  You know  Staten Island  Where everything's  Gone to shit  Any of the shore towns  Are just  It's incredible  And I'm telling  And I was actually thinking  As I'm waiting there online  Like what happens  If this is  The new regular  Like would it become  Crazy town 
[03:44:30]  Or would people  Just get used to it  Like if from now on  You have to wait  Three hours  To get gas  Like if that's just  The thing now  Would you go crazy  Or I  Personally  I think  People would probably  Just deal with it  Like I think  People would like  To think that  We'd all go crazy  But we'd probably  Just be like  Oh it's Friday  I gotta do my  Three hour gas thing  Like you'd leave work  And that would be  Your ritual  You'd probably use  Less gas  But people are dumb 
[03:45:00]  You know  You just  You don't want  Nobody actually  Wants chaos  There'd probably be  Some people  Trying to cheat it  Or whatever  But no more  Than there are now  And most people  Would probably just  As long as  Gas station  Didn't really run out  People would wait  For three hours  For gas  Because I gotta  I gotta go somewhere  And what's the alternative  Riding a bicycle  Sal you've been riding  A bicycle to work  Yes I do  You wouldn't do that  Every day though  Especially through the winter  No like  My entire body  Was frozen this morning  My lungs hurt  And there's a 
[03:45:30]  Nor'easter coming  Yeah  Wednesday I think  Yeah my bike  Would not be able  To handle that at all  So you'd wait  So you had a car though  You used to  Yeah I love driving  So why don't you drive  I sold my car  For what  How much did you get  For it  I got a good amount  For it  You got any of that left  No  Why what'd you do with it  I actually bought  Audio gear with it  What  You're terrible  At production though  Ah it's not funny  Show up play the  I know it's  Play the panda thing  Just to illustrate this  You just spent 
[03:46:00]  A car's worth of money  On audio stuff  For music  Not fucking  Play the panda thing  Play the panda thing  Don't get  The panda  Angry  You had  To be a better driver  Than a guy  Who knows how to  Use audio stuff  Yeah  The stuff I bought  For audio  Was for music  Related stuff  That I do  Outside of the show  This is something  Yeah  You gotta  You should've  Kept the car  You really should've  Kept the car  You're trying to  Make a point  So how has 
[03:46:30]  How has the  Bike ride been  I love doing it  But when I came in  On Friday  Going into the  Lower East Side  Was fucking scary  Man  It was  Oh cause the  Power's back now  Yeah the power's  Back now  So like I could  See where I'm going  But it was  Absolutely terrifying  With people like  Shouting at me  And stuff like that  It was really  Really sketchy  People were shouting  At you?  Oh yeah  Why?  Cause I don't know  I'm just like  You know a white boy  In fucking Alphabet City  Like riding my bike around  You know  I didn't even pick up on it  But they were  They were screaming at me  So you 
[03:47:00]  But you don't know  What they were saying?  No I had my headphones in  But I heard like  You know  I heard screams  Maybe they were just fans  It was Salmania  No it was just me  Getting very terrified  They were fans of the show  But they were all excited  That you were driving  Through the park  It's Sal!  Were they trying to  Rip off your shirt and stuff?  Yeah  What an exciting bike ride  I would take that bike ride  Every single day  It was pretty cool  Going over the bridge  But literally  Halfway through the bridge  There's no power  So it's like  You're riding into  Complete darkness  And I have a road bike  And if you hit  A fucking pebble  You're gonna eat shit  Why would you get a bike 
[03:47:30]  Where if you hit a pebble  You eat shit?  It's a road bike  It's not really meant for  You know  Off-roading  Or like heavy curbs  Or anything like that  Why don't you just get a bike?  I do have a bike  Like a bike bike  Yeah I have one  But this you can go  Much longer distances  How many bikes do you have?  I have two  You really are a rich kid  I'm not rich  What are you talking about?  You got two bikes  Your own apartment in Brooklyn  A car worth of audio equipment  You change out jeans every season  What type of life do you lead?  I live a very 
[03:48:00]  Richie rich?  A very exciting life  A very comfortable life  Is what it sounds like  Yeah I guess  Yeah  You get a lot of down time too  To just enjoy your money?  No  Yeah you do  No I work on my creative stuff  Outside of work  What kind of  Why don't you work on some  Creative stuff inside of work  Every now and then?  Well you know I do  And then it fucking  Fails miserably  Exactly  You've done one thing  And it was just awful  Yeah it's traumatic  Is that what happened?  Yeah I have like  Definitely some post-traumatic  Stress from that  You don't want to take  Another stab at it?  Yeah maybe someday  But  Well I mean that's the thing 
[03:48:30]  You got money  So what do you  What's the  What's motivating you right?  You got what you need  You got two bikes  And a car's worth of audio  Equipment  Yeah  And you know  A penthouse apartment  Yep the penthouse is pretty fucking  And you're just cruising through town  You got everything you need  If you needed a car  Like if this kept up  And you were like  Mom and dad  I really need a car  Would they be like  Okay Sal  We'll get you a car  Yeah  They what?  Yeah  They would buy you a car?  I mean I'm sure I'd have to like  Help out in some way  Wait take out the garbage?  Clean up after dinner? 
[03:49:00]  Your parents would buy you a car?  I think so yeah  You know what my dad would say  If I was like look  You know  If I didn't have a car  If I lived in the city  And I was like  Oh I don't know when this transit stuff  Is going to come back  My dad would be like  Yeah me neither  I'd be like yeah  I could really use a car  My dad would be like  Thank god you have a job  You could save your money for it  Yeah I mean I think it wouldn't be like  You know  Next day sort of thing  But it would be something I can allude to  And then eventually maybe work on  Oh my god  At your age you should be ashamed  You should be ashamed 
[03:49:30]  That your parents would still buy you a car  You need to leave the nest  I'm an only child  It's just me  You need to leave the nest  I've left the nest  You haven't left the nest  You're staying in an apartment  That you got on a deal  Through a family friend  Yeah  Your parents are buying you bicycles  No I bought  I bought every bicycle  With my own money  How many bicycles have you purchased?  Uh two  I have two  Alright  You have two bikes  Yep  You're obviously still very well taken care of  Yeah but I like I was set off in the right path you know  You were not set off in the right path 
[03:50:00]  Your parents are still paying your cell phone bill  They are paying my cell phone bill  You have no sense of personal responsibility  I have plenty of  What are you talking about?  I can take care of myself just fine  No you couldn't  I'm responsible with my spending  I don't spend like I used to spend anymore  You just bought two bikes  No I bought  And a car's worth of audio equipment  And you can't even do production  I bought my two bikes  A while ago  How long ago?  My bike I'm riding now  I bought  I don't know  About eight months ago  And another bike years ago  Why would you buy another bike 
[03:50:30]  If you already had a bike?  Well it's  One's meant for road  And one's meant for mountain  How many mountains do you ride on?  Lots  There are no mountains in Brooklyn  No  When I was in Staten Island  And I used to take my bike  Like upstate  What mountains in Staten Island?  There's a lot of really good off-road  There's mountains in Staten Island  Not mountains but there's hills  You know  Because I was just talking to Anthony  About Staten Island  And he never mentioned one mountain  He mentioned some firemen that got robbed  He mentioned some people who lost their homes  And he mentioned that he didn't have power  Never once did he mention any mountains 
[03:51:00]  Staten Island  I think it's like the second highest elevation  On the eastern seaboard  So you're saying there are mountains in Staten Island  Not mountains but there's hills  Well you said before there were mountains  I said I mountain bike  I have a mountain bike  That you can use on mountains  I never said there are mountains in Staten Island  You don't need a mountain bike  Because  Why?  There are no mountains  You should  Nobody your age  Should be able to have a bicycle  Who's working here  You should  Or not two bicycles  You should have had to sell the first bike 
[03:51:30]  To get the second bike  Not like  Oh I got lots of money  Just sitting around  Let me get two bikes  Let me sell this car  And I don't need to use the money for rent  I just buy audio bullshit with it  Alright if we need to really break it down  The first bike I bought  When I was working at a different place  What place?  I was working at like an auto shop  Like you know  Your dad's auto shop?  No not my dad's auto shop  Did he get you the job?  Nope  How'd you get the job?  I went in and asked for the job myself  That's when I first got my car  My parents insisted that I got a job  So I did that  But did they buy you the car? 
[03:52:00]  No it was like a savings sort of thing  Oh my god  Your parents were like  We'll buy you a car  But you have to get a job  And you got some bullshit like auto job  Where you were sweeping the floors  Yeah  How long were you at that job?  I was there for like  Probably like eight months  Eight months  And then you just drove away in your new car  And I went to college  So  But uh  And then with the bike I have now  When I was still living at home  When I got my first paycheck  That was like my treat to myself  So do you listen to rap song?  Your treat to yourself? 
[03:52:30]  Yeah it was a  What the fuck are you talking about?  You haven't even been alive long enough  To have a treat for yourself  I bought it  Why would you buy a treat for yourself?  You haven't earned any treats  I've seen you  I can do whatever the fuck I want  With my own money  You didn't earn a treat  Like what did you say?  What was it that made you say  I deserve a treat?  It was just like  I was living at home  I had no expenses  So I was like  Whatever  I'll fucking  I'll spend a paycheck on a bike  It's fine  So what  No you said  It was my treat to myself  Yes  Meaning  I deserve a reward 
[03:53:00]  When Iraq  Iraq loves treats  By the way  Where is Iraq today?  Uh  Eric is on vacation today  He's on vacation?  Well he took a vacation day  I don't know if he's fucking  Making coke floats  Yeah  He makes a little staycation  He puts a little palm tree up in his basement  And plays uh  A little bit of Netflix  Yeah and he plays  What's his name?  Uh  Cheeseburger in Paradise  Yeah  Um  What  But when he's  When he treats himself  It's because  He does like a little bit of work  And then he's like 
[03:53:30]  Oh that was a tough work  I'm gonna go  Get myself a coke float  Like he'll  Edit one little bit of audio  Like he'll take a five minute piece of audio  And he'll edit it down to two minutes  And then he'll be like  I'm gonna go get some Wendy's  To treat myself  Because he feels he deserves a reward  That's how the mind works  Right  And when somebody says  That they're treating themselves  It's because they feel like  They deserve a reward  So what did you do  That you felt  I need to buy myself a bicycle  Uh I don't know 
[03:54:00]  I just really wanted a bike  And I had  I had no expense  Another bike you mean  I wanted another bike  I really wanted another bike  I wanted another one  Oh Sal  You should try to do without  For a period of time  And see what happens  You can come in Nicole  You know you're always welcome in here  I was missing you today  We were just talking to Sal  Sal  He's that idiot in there  Yeah  What's up Sal  Hi Nicole how are you  He's got two bikes  Like bicycles or motorbikes  He's got two bicycles  Yeah  He's got an apartment 
[03:54:30]  That's in Brooklyn  And he lives in by himself  Cool  Yes  He sold a car  And spent all the money  On audio shit  And he's terrible at production  Mmhmm  And Sal you are terrible at production  You're not being very nice to him  Well listen  Alright  You need to have it  Play the panda thing  Oh  He's a piece of his production work  This is Sal's production work  This is him being creative  Don't get the panda angry  What was that for  Is there anything 
[03:55:00]  First of all  A panda doesn't make that noise  No  Second of all  That's like a grizzly bear  Right  Or like a tiger  A lion or something  It could be a variety of animals  Not a panda  None of it panda  Second  His voice doesn't  It's a terrible  Awful  Use of his voice  That was your voice?  Yeah I know right  It's terrible  It didn't sound like an angry  Wait so he at least admits  That he is not good  No  He  Let me explain this to you Nicole  He walked in here  With that production piece  As if  Wait till you hear  What Sal's created now 
[03:55:30]  Oh he was excited  At the beginning  The reason he's saying  It's terrible  Is because the rest of us  Said it was terrible  And now he says it's terrible  Okay  Alright  It's called denial  Because if he thought it was terrible  When he made it  He probably wouldn't have  Given it to the Oapster  Perhaps  And Oap was real  Was he like  Did he just really come down on him?  Well the whole room  Was just like  What the fuck was that?  What was that in regard to?  Why did you need a panda  Piece of production?  It was just fucking stupid  It was intended for Roland  Oh okay  I think I've paid my fucking penance  On this  Okay so you want to move on maybe? 
[03:56:00]  What you paid for  Was two bikes  And a car load  Of audio equipment  Yes  His parents pay his cell phone bill  They do?  How old are you dude?  I'm 22  Exactly  Fuck  I was paying for it all through college  He bought a bicycle  To treat himself  A second bicycle  Because he was a good boy  Exactly  He was like  This is a treat to myself  He's a good boy  And I'm trying to tell him  He has no idea  And his parents have no idea  The damage  That they're doing to him  He thinks  Like he fully acknowledges  That his generation 
[03:56:30]  Is very sort of entitled  Oh we say that all the time  And everything's handed to them  Participation trophy  All this stuff  Right  He acknowledges that that's his generation  But he fully believes  In his sane mind  That Sal  This boy right here  This boy  Sweet sweet boy  Is not  That doesn't apply to him  I've never said  I've always said  I'm of that generation  Yes  That involves my life  I've never denied that  Right he's admitting it  So you're saying 
[03:57:00]  You are that type of  Entitled person  I've said that like  400 times on the show  But you're saying no  If you've said that  How can a person  Say that about themselves  And then not try to correct it  Instead go out  And buy yourself a bicycle  No there's nothing  I'm going to do about correcting it  This is the life that I live  So I'm going  I've accepted it  That's what I mean  That's the entitlement  That is not acknowledged  It is acknowledged  What are you talking about  I've acknowledged it  And I'm living my life like that  Why would you accept that  I think you're just jealous Sam  Yeah obviously  I don't want two bicycles  No but that you don't just  Get everything handed to you 
[03:57:30]  No because you know what  Sal gets handed to him  A shit sandwich  Because here on this show  We have something called  The bullshit detector  And it goes off all the time  Every time this kid  Steps in a room  The bullshit detector  Yes  I've admitted that  This is the lifestyle  That I live  Why would you accept that  Why would you accept  I'm just going to be  Somebody who is described as  Why are you being so mean to him  Because  This is Sam  Because people need to learn  Sam every fucking day  Sam's not mean to me  Well one day it will be  Well no I am mean to you  But you just  You're kind of like an airhead 
[03:58:00]  So it kind of goes right over  Like it's right over the top  You know what I mean  Like I'll call you  I don't know  Your little bullshit  That you do  Yeah  But Sal isn't used to being  Called out on his bullshit  And you're calling out  Because why  He's entitled  You got it Nicole  Yeah  If you had gotten that wrong  I would have given you  Some shit for it  He's a good boy  Why  I am a good boy  You are a good boy  You deserve a bicycle  I do  But why is that the thing  That you chose to get  That's my question  A bicycle  Go get like a new  I don't know  TV 
[03:58:30]  Or something  Or a prostitute  Yeah maybe  Get laid  Get blown you know  Yeah  I don't need to pay for that  Or some wrestler  Oh  Nicole  I'm surprised  Didn't you notice  Your panties get sopping wet  When you walked in this room  And saw Sal  I'm juicing everywhere  Yeah  Why would he need to pay for that  Sal  Yes Sal  Here's my question to you  Go ahead  And I don't mean to get  Violent with you  Yeah okay  And upset  And loud  I don't mean to get loud  With you  But you're gonna  But 
[03:59:00]  Why would you  Say  Yes  I know  That I'm  Described as an entitled  Douchebag  And that's sort of  The personality  That I'm fitting  And that's my life  And I'm going to live it  Instead of saying  You know what  I don't want to be  An entitled douchebag  I should do some things  To change that  Like why  Maybe he doesn't think  It's a problem  Do you not  See those as negative qualities  I mean I don't  I don't really see how  I come off as a 
[03:59:30]  As an  I guess I come off  As an entitled person  But I do a lot of things  That you know  Giving back to other people  Like I don't fucking  Only you know  Do things for myself  Or spend only money on myself  Have you helped  With the Sandy efforts  No not yet  They could use some bikes  You got two  So I'll donate a bike  Donate one of your bikes  To Sandy  I will  Because she needs it  She does  That bitch  You know why  Because those guys  Are stuck  You wake up in the morning  And you're like  Oh the subway's not working 
[04:00:00]  I need to decide  Which of my two bikes  To take to work  No I never said that  I mean it's  It's how I got to work  This is how I chose  To drive  That's the decision  Of the day though  Yeah  Can you imagine  Leaving college  You're handed  A cushy job  Because he's done  This job that he's got  For himself  Pretty cushy  Cushy  That's why  He gets so much shit  From me  Because somebody's  Got to give it to him  Do you have a girlfriend's  How  Currently no  Wow  And whose choice is that  Mine 
[04:00:30]  You don't want one  You don't want to take care  No bitch  Because you know what  You ask Sal  He can get a bitch  Anytime he wants  Anytime  He doesn't need to pay  For that shit  I didn't say that  I'm just saying  I don't think morally  It's correct to pay for sex  No I agree with you  Wait you have moral objections  To prostitution  Just for me  I don't think it's something  That I think is appealing  It doesn't appeal to me  Oh but that's not  Like a moral thing  It just doesn't do it for you  Let me take that back  It's not a moral thing  It's just something  That doesn't appeal to me  When you know  You can get something  More out of it 
[04:01:00]  Okay well that's fine  Yeah  That's fine  Yeah  What's not fine  Is mother goose  Taking care of you still  Yeah mama's gotta  Mama's gotta let go  Yeah  Papa's gotta get  A brand new bag  Yeah  And it's not Sal  No  No  I'm an only child  There's just me  Oh so that's why  That's part of the problem  The prodigal son is here  I  No first of all  He isn't  And he thinks he is the prodigal  Like Sal thinks he's the shit  I am  But he's not  He's terrible  Don't say that 
[04:01:30]  Now you're just being a dick  Somebody's gotta say it to him  No but why being  You're now being mean  Okay  He's not good here  Is the thing  I hope you buy him lunch  Or something later  Because he's got it  Oh yeah  He's got it  He should be buying me lunch  I'm teaching him life lessons  Right right  Plus he's got it  His mom gave him his lunch money today  Did your mom pay for your lunch  No  I'm just joking with you  Did she Sal  She did not  Did she pack it for you  Sal  Jess packs me lunch  It's gonna be delivered  I don't pack Matt lunch  Well you're not a good wife 
[04:02:00]  No I'm a very good wife  I let  I'm such a good wife  That I got  I got a midnight raping the other day  And I just let it happen  You got a midnight raping  I was sleeping  Enough of you  Explain to me about this  That's being a good wife  Explain to me  Nicole  I'm just gonna  I'm just gonna put it in  I'm sleeping Matt  It's okay  Go back to sleep  What?  You don't care if I'm coherent?  This is Nicole from the morning mashup by the way  Yeah I let him do it too  Cause I'm a good wife  So you're sitting there sleeping  Sleeping  It's midnight  You got a morning show  Yeah dude I'm sleeping honey 
[04:02:30]  Just like  And your husband just says  I'm just gonna put it in  I'm just gonna put it in  And I said  But not now I'm sleeping  And he said it's okay  He didn't care that I was sleeping  Don't even worry about it  Don't worry about it  I'll take care of everything  And I just  I  I  Let myself stay in that state of sleep  And I let him do it  And then I woke up  And I was like  What the fuck?  Did you feel taken advantage of?  Not really  I mean he's my husband  Did they have sex with you to completion?  Yeah  Did he come inside you?  Yeah then I gotta get up  And I had to go to the bathroom  After I had to pee  It was like a whole thing 
[04:03:00]  And I was like now I'm awake  That you douche  Did you try to jump up and down  And shake it out a little bit  Or you just keep all the goodness in you?  No that's why you pee  Oh  Oh okay  That's the point  Yeah  So you were more pissed off  That you had  No pun intended  No  That you had to go take a pee  No I was more  As opposed to that you had just  Been pseudo raped by your husband  It's for a variety of reasons  Number one I was sleeping  Number two  Do you not care that I don't participate  In the actual  He doesn't  Love making activity  You didn't participate at all?  No  Oh wow  I just was turned over  And just  Yeah 
[04:03:30]  Weren't you  Very dry down there?  He took care of that too  I mean  With saliva?  I don't know what  I was sleeping  Sam  I don't really know what happened  Did he poke around down there at all first?  Yeah  He did?  Yeah  Just to try to at least  Even if the rest of you was sleeping  Try to get  Yeah  Your vagina  Must have worked  I don't know  I was still really half asleep  So don't ever call me a bad wife  Because I don't pack him lunch  Because I think that's a very good wife  Who just lets her husband use her body  You allow rapes  I allow to rape  Yeah  Hence  I'm a good wife 
[04:04:00]  So you have brought  To  After Opie and Anthony Live  That your husband is a rapist  Who uses the N word regularly  Yeah man  You love him though  I love him so much  He's the best  He's actually very good to me  And I in turn  I'm very good to him  I let him midnight rape  You wouldn't like  And you decided  I'm not gonna like  Wake up and try to participate  No I couldn't  I was too  I was so cozy  I mean he uncozied me  Because I was like  You know like  Blam bam bam bam bam  But  What are you gonna do?  You gotta make sacrifices in marriage  What turned him on 
[04:04:30]  To the point that he had to  Have you at that moment?  I think he just woke up  With a chub  And he was ready to go  And he didn't care that I wasn't  Yeah he just woke  You wake up in the morning sometimes  Usually guys are  Erect  Yeah  It's part of just waking up in the morning  For a guy  I know but  I mean usually you could piss  And it goes away  No  Not rape your wife  No he went for  He went for the latter  Did you enjoy the raping part?  Nope  Not at all  No  There wasn't something thrilling  Like you didn't say to yourself  I'm being taken advantage of  No I was more  More annoyed than 
[04:05:00]  Than excited  You were just annoyed  Like oh I'm trying to sleep  And there's a penis in me  Yeah  Yeah  And I was annoyed that he didn't care  That I wasn't part of the process  Because it's not like  You know like  You want to do it together  Is he well endowed?  Yeah  So this was not something like  No it wasn't like easy  It didn't like go  It didn't like slip on in  Right  It was awful  And I mean you've been around  Yeah  So even a medium one  Would fit in you very easily  Shut up Sam  I'm just saying  I'm assuming  And you could say I'm wrong  Right or wrong  Well if you're not  I mean  If you're dry as the Sahara  Right 
[04:05:30]  Nothing's gonna go in that easily  And you weren't having a sexual dream  Or anything like that  Nothing  I was sleeping  Holding my dog  And you know what  You were holding your dog?  I was holding Phoebe  I don't even think  Now that I'm thinking back about it  That I put Phoebe on the ground  Because I was sleeping  I was cozy holding my dog  So that's even gross  So it's almost like he raped her too  You held your dog  While your husband raped you?  Brian in Chicago?  Yeah  He didn't rape her  No?  I don't mean to throw that word around  But I mean I didn't say  All he did was use you to jack off 
[04:06:00]  That's all it was  That's true  He did  He used you as a fleshlight  You were a human fleshlight for him  Yeah  Have you seen a fleshlight?  I have  It's actually very cool  It's a vagina in a tube  And that's basically  You were a human fleshlight  I was a human fleshlight  He was actually a little annoyed  That your legs were in the way  And there were parts he had to move  Don't worry  He moved them  He did  Oh yeah  He didn't mind  Nope  What do you think about  Just being used as a  I mean that is  I believe  Maybe the most objectifying thing  Somebody could do to a person  No  It's probably way worse  I mean using you as a sexual 
[04:06:30]  Object  He literally used you  As a masturbation tool  I know  But it was like  I know he loves me  And it's not like we don't have  A good sex life  On other days  It was just a moment  Of weakness for him  He didn't want me  To fully wake up  Because he knew I was sleeping  So he thought he'd just  Get in and out  Get his needs taken care of  And we wouldn't worry about me  Andrew  Yep I'm here Sam  How you doing buddy?  What's up buddy?  That was  That was Mr. Kumi  Flying around  Doing his dream raping  That wasn't her husband  Well you know what  We always wonder 
[04:07:00]  If what's going on  In your dreams  Is happening  In somebody else's dreams  At the same time  Really?  Like the people in your dreams  If they're dreaming  That you're in  You know what I mean?  Right  Anthony rapes in his dreams  Like he rapes women  Are you joking?  No  Like for real  Like holds them down  And they're saying  No no please  He told us one day  That he sometimes  Comes to an actualization  That he is dreaming  And once he does that  He finds whatever girls  He can and he rapes them  What?  So maybe that was him  In your bedroom  Raping you  But it was your dream 
[04:07:30]  Perhaps  That's the sickest thing  I've ever heard in my life  You know what's worse?  I can never look at him  The same  You know what's worse?  Your husband raping you  In real life  That's probably a little worse  Because at least I'm his wife  At least I'm his wife  It's not some random chick  That he did it to  I saw the chick on Mad Men  Get raped by her husband  And she didn't like it at all  Really?  We have to go  Okay  Rana Fez are coming up  Next  Nicole  Thank you for stopping by  Anytime  Sal  Yes  Thank you for being here  We love you Sal  Don't say we Nicole  Oh sorry  I love you Sal  Wrong pronoun  Stay tuned for Rana Fez
