<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony After Show, hosted by Sam Roberts, featured a lively mix of medical discussions, promotional segments, and off-color humor.  In the studio were Dr. Steve, P.A. John, P.A. Jill (though she was briefly absent to get a drink), Big A, and Bobo.  A significant portion of the show focused on promoting *Dr. Steve's Weird Medicine*, a Saturday night call-in show offering uncensored medical advice.  This promotion was punctuated by the playing of a clip featuring Jesse Ventura's false claim that fluoride is the main ingredient in Prozac, which Dr. Steve subsequently refuted.

The show then opened the phone lines to listener calls, resulting in a series of consultations covering a range of medical concerns.  These included a post-appendectomy infection, hearing loss stemming from a baseball injury, a persistent anal abscess, and a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy.  One caller's question about experiencing ejaculation during bowel movements prompted a discussion of prostatic congestion.  The conversations were characterized by the hostsâ€™ informal style and frequent interruptions.

Alongside the medical segments, the show also promoted a physical fitness challenge involving E-Rock and others, offering a $1000 prize and race tickets as incentives.  Finally, the hosts advertised an upcoming Joe Rogan marathon before signing off. The entire broadcast maintained a consistently crude and humorous tone.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  The virus, Sirius XM.  Hey, hey, hey!  And now, the Opie and Anthony show continues.  This is After O&A Live.  Here's your host, Sam Roberts.  Are we interrupting something, Dr. Steve?  Yes, you are.  It's After Opie and Anthony Live.  Everybody's gone, of course.  They started their weekends, but we haven't.  And we're joined by some very special guests today.  Dr. Steve!  Yes, my friend.  P.A. John. 
[00:00:30]  Hello.  And P.A. Jill.  She's not in here.  Did you seriously send her to the kitchen by herself to get a drink?  Yeah, I would have walked with her, but I have something to do.  Well, you don't have any drinks anymore.  Patty went with her.  Yeah, don't worry. Patty's taking her.  Yeah, and also, for some reason, I don't know, Big A, Stalker Patty, and Bobo are still sitting in here.  Big A, you're welcome to stay.  Bobo, I'm confused by your presence.  Yeah, I told Andrew he was fine.  I don't know why the others are here.  I don't know.  Where is the mouse for this?  I got it.  You want it?  Oh, no.  As long as I tell you. 
[00:01:00]  It's a special after Opie and Anthony Live today, because we have Dr. Steve in studio,  and we're N.P.A., John, of course.  I don't want to leave you out, John.  Don't worry about it.  We're doing a slimmed down version of Weird Medicine.  If you don't know, Weird Medicine, the plug was bad that they gave you today.  It's Saturday at midnight, this Saturday.  This Saturday, is it?  Next Saturday, it's starting at 10.  I don't think we're on this Saturday.  It's probably Big Kev.  Is he still?  I don't know what they're doing.  Well, next Saturday at 10 p.m., you'll be able to hear Weird Medicine. 
[00:01:30]  That's going to be its regular time slot.  I guess we better record some shows.  Yeah, yeah.  After Special Delivery, if you listen to Special Delivery, then keep listening, because Weird  Medicine is on after us when Big Kev's geek stuff isn't.  And it's very good.  But what Dr. Steve and P.A. John and P.A. Jill and the rest of them do is they take your  calls.  They do voicemails, because it's not a live show, but they take your calls, and they give  you medical advice that's actually uncensored, entertaining, and they talk to you like a human 
[00:02:00]  being, which doesn't really happen on the radio.  It doesn't happen in the doctor's office.  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's the type of, like, the description makes it sound like, I don't  know, it sounds like boring doctor radio.  But Jess and me listen every single week on our drive home, and it's more entertaining  than Special Delivery is.  No, surely not.  You guys do a good job.  Is there some kind of thing you have to say about not taking medical advice or something?  Yeah, we're not your medical providers.  Take anything you hear from us with a grain of salt.  Check it out with your regular medical provider, your primary care yoga master, tai chi expert, 
[00:02:30]  whatever.  Yeah.  We're just here, you know.  I'm just your old pal with a medical degree.  And in the great words of Ron Bennington, don't take medical advice from some asshole  on the radio.  That's right.  Perfect advice.  So if you want to call in 866-WOW-1-WOW, 866-969-1969, with whatever ails you.  Do you want to, while we're waiting for the phone?  Oh, I noticed the CD you gave me had your theme music on it, which I thought was cute. 
[00:03:00]  But that's not going down.  Okay, well, I tried.  Did you want to go to a clip before we went to the calls?  You know, I mentioned on Ron and Fez yesterday that Dr. Kaku, the last time he was on Ron  and Fez, actually made me feel better about my children's future.  So I feel a little better about him.  But Jesse Ventura...  Because you've had a long-standing feud with Dr. Kaku.  I wouldn't call it a feud.  It was a one-sided feud because he has no idea who you are.  He has no clue who I am. 
[00:03:30]  And he was supposed to be on my show once and then didn't show up.  Son of a bitch.  He was out of town, so I guess he gets a pass for that.  Whatever.  Whatever.  But Jesse Ventura said something on Ron Bennington interviews, and I took a clip of it.  And this shit really pissed me off.  I just wondered if you wouldn't mind playing it.  I wouldn't mind at all.  This is the type of shit that gets under Dr. Steve's skin, as said by Jesse Ventura.  Uh, fluoride in the water, right? 
[00:04:00]  Do you know what fluoride's the main ingredient to?  No.  Prozac.  So we got Prozac in the water.  Think that's a good idea?  To be drinking Prozac every time you have a glass of tap water?  If it's got fluoride in it, that's the main ingredient to Prozac.  It doesn't sound like a good idea, Dr. Steve.  I don't want water.  If you keep saying it over and over like that, it doesn't make it any more true.  No?  Okay.  Not you.  I'm talking about...  No, no, no. 
[00:04:30]  I know.  Of course.  Okay.  Prozac, indeed, has fluorine atoms in it.  It has three of them.  That's why it's called fluoxetine.  That's its generic term.  But the fluoride has nothing to do with the antidepressant properties of Prozac.  And it's just like saying, well, you know, there's nitrogen and oxygen in nitroglycerin,  and there's nitrogen in the air.  We're breathing explosives.  It's, you know, it's...  That's true. 
[00:05:00]  It's just horseshit.  So pulling chemicals out of chemical compounds does not...  No, pulling atoms out.  It's the shape of the molecule that gives the...  Substance?  Thank you.  The substance its effect.  It has...  The fluorine atoms work, or, you know, they have a function in shaping that molecule.  But that's all.  And so adding... 
[00:05:30]  Just taking those three atoms out and putting it in water has nothing to do with antidepressant properties.  So putting fluoride in water, whether you agree with it or not, for other reasons,  because it's a government basically mandating that you take better care of your teeth.  I was about to say, it sounds like it'd be great for your teeth.  Well, that's why they do it.  That sounds great.  They put fluoride in it.  Well, yeah, I mean...  There are strict constitutionalists that feel that that's, you know, that...  So they can make that argument.  But it has absolutely nothing to do with antidepressant effects.  We're not...  The government was not trying to pacify the populace when they added fluoride to the water in 1952, by the way. 
[00:06:00]  It hasn't worked.  And wouldn't Jesse Ventura also have a problem with dentists?  Wouldn't that be an extremely concentrated dose of fluoride that they're giving kids?  And those fluoride treatments?  That's a lot of Prozac for a little kid.  Yeah.  So, you know, the issue that I have is, though, I can't argue with him about 9-11.  I mean, you're a doctor.  It's Dr. Steve's Weird Medicine. 
[00:06:30]  Why would you?  Oh, exactly right.  And I...  But I don't have the knowledge to counter his arguments.  And I can't argue with him on all this other stuff that he has on his show.  But the one time that he ventured into territory where I have some knowledge, he shit the bed.  And, I mean, it's just such complete bullshit.  So you would assume, then, if you knew a little more about the 9-11 stuff, he would shit the bed on that, too.  Makes you wonder.  Makes you wonder. 
[00:07:00]  Again, the show is live.  So, well, you can't call in now because all the lines are busy.  But they'll free up.  So keep calling 866-WOW-1-WOW.  866-969-1969.  Let's take Kevin from Houston.  Yeah, okay.  Kevin in Houston, you're on.  Weird Medicine meets after Opie and Anthony Live.  Oh, great.  Glad to be on.  Thanks for having me.  Dr. Steve, how do we get rid of this asshole between the 10 and 11 o'clock hours?  Oh, shit.  It says, has personal anal-related questions. 
[00:07:30]  I would appreciate it if you had a follow-up medical question after the sand bashing so it's not just a total waste of time.  Do you want to go to Oscar in Texas?  Yeah, let's do Oscar.  Okay.  This will be a good one for Jill.  Oscar in Texas, you're on this show.  Thank you, Sam.  Hey, Dr. Steve, I had an orthoscopic appendicitis surgery about three weeks ago.  And I went back to the doctor because I was still feeling like shit.  And everybody told me I should be, you know, all playing basketball by now. 
[00:08:00]  But anyway, they ran my blood work in a CT scan.  And they said I had an infection.  But when I got out of that surgery, that doctor said everything was fine.  It went perfect.  The son of a bitch didn't rupture or anything.  So why do I have an infection?  Did that motherfucker not wash his hands when he was in my guts or what the hell?  Well, actually, P.A. Jill has done a bunch of these surgeries.  How lucky.  She can.  Very lucky. 
[00:08:30]  Very lucky.  About this one.  You can get an infection after any surgery.  So even though your appendix didn't rupture and cause an infection prior to your surgery, afterwards you can have infection, well, from various reasons.  Just from the surgery itself, we're introducing, even though we do everything sterilely, sometimes bacteria can get in there and cause an infection after surgery.  He is messing with your bowel.  So it's possible there could have been some injury there that he was unaware of going through the laparoscope that now you have an infection. 
[00:09:00]  It kind of depends.  It could be something simple.  It could be something really serious.  But it's definitely something that happens, unfortunately.  When you do an appendectomy, is there any 100% guarantee that you're not going to contaminate the peritoneum when you do that?  I mean, you've got an infected body part that you're cutting out.  No, absolutely not.  I mean, there's always a risk of surgery.  You're doing laparoscopic or you're doing it open.  Whether it's already ruptured or not, you're obviously doing an appendectomy, but you're resecting that away from the colon. 
[00:09:30]  So you're getting into bowel material.  You're trying to do it in a sterile fashion, and you should wash everything out afterwards.  But definitely is there still a risk for infection?  And, dude, when they do it laparoscopically, they're basically doing it with those Waldo arms.  You know, you're doing it remotely.  You're sticking two sticks in and trying to do surgery from basically three feet away.  Yeah.  And I have... 
[00:10:00]  You'd think you guys would have figured that out better by now.  Well, they have.  They do really well.  They do really well, and they're usually very successful, and people usually do not get infections.  But just with lack after any surgery, you know, whether it be something that's infected prior to or after, doesn't mean that they necessarily did anything wrong or that they didn't tell you the whole story.  It's just possibility that you get an infection.  Spoken like a true surgeon.  Exactly.  Hey, Oscar, did they have to put you in the hospital?  Yes.  Yeah, I was in the hospital for about four days. 
[00:10:30]  I mean, after they found out that you still had infection in your bag?  No, no, no.  He gave me a bunch of medication orally, and he said, take this and call him if I don't start feeling better.  Okay.  And he gave me a follow-up appointment.  And then he said, if I don't get better, I might have to have surgery.  Yep.  Now, what do they do surgery-wise?  Do they just go in there and just cut out anything that's bad?  Well, basically what will happen is if you don't get better, you'll know it because you'll have continued pain. 
[00:11:00]  You probably will have fever, and the pain in your belly will get to the point where it's pretty hard to ignore.  And then if they find that you have, then they'll work you up and see where the infection is.  And if you have an abscess in your abdomen, then that'll have to be drained surgically.  Now, Jill, will they do that in an open at that point, or will they do an exploratory with the scope?  More than likely, it would be open because you want to be certain that you're irrigating that out extremely well. 
[00:11:30]  So most of the time, any kind of abscess, wash-out, clean-out kind of procedure, you're going to do it in an open fashion.  And your body has an amazing way of walling that infection off and making just like a little pocket.  So, you know, if that happens and you have to have it cleaned out, hopefully it will be very limited and just be a small area.  It's irrigated, washed out.  You may continue on some antibiotics, and you may do just fine.  Now, I've got one more question.  What are the chances of me having to have a colostomy bag because of this? 
[00:12:00]  Because I really feel like shit.  Yeah, you'd have to have a really serious infection where they had to go in and sever the connection at the bowel and then take it to the outside just to get it to heal.  That would really be a pretty serious thing.  I'd say that's on the outside.  Yeah, I would say after this type of surgery with a postoperative infection, that would be very low. 
[00:12:30]  So with other bowel surgeries, definitely more of a risk.  Good luck with it, man.  And, you know, email me, weirdmedicinexm at gmail.com, and give us an update.  Or you can call our regular number, which is 347-POOHEAD.  POOHEAD?  You're a doctor.  And leave a voicemail and give us an update.  We'll play it on our show.  Thanks, Oscar.  Thanks, Doug.  So tune in to Weird Medicine for the Oscar update Saturdays starting next week at 10 p.m. Eastern. 
[00:13:00]  You, we don't have a whole lot of time here today, so we got a couple calls about the fluoride thing and medical questions.  What do you want?  It's Dr. Steve's ride.  I'm just, you know, a passenger.  Let's do Mike from Chicago.  You like that?  Okay.  Mike, you're on Dr. Steve and Sam present whatever this is.  Hey, Sam.  Hey, Dr. Steve.  Hey, hey, hey.  Sorry.  Diarrhea, the mouth, and constipation of the brain.  Regarding the fluoride treatment in the water, you know, obviously I've been told for years that, you know, 
[00:13:30]  an excessive amount of fluoride is obviously a bad thing, slows down brain cells, and, you know,  kills brain cells, whatever makes you dumber.  I feel like I'm a victim of that already.  What, you know, what long-term effects are there?  You know, the other thing is you're supposed to drink X amount of water per day.  Has that been taken into consideration?  Yes.  Yeah.  What they do is, you know, okay, sometimes they have to take fluoride out of the water. 
[00:14:00]  There are some aquifers that have a high amount of fluoride, and they'll actually do defluoridation.  You want a level of fluoride that's about 0.5 milligrams per liter, and what that does is it will prevent tooth decay.  It's one of the number...  If we could get Dr. Joe Kaye or one of the, you know, the board dentists to call in in the next, what, three minutes? 
[00:14:30]  He would tell you, I think, that fluoridation has been the number one thing that the government has done to prevent tooth decay,  and that the levels that are in water are not enough to cause hyperfluoridation,  which is, if you overdose on fluoride, it can cause your bones to be brittle and your teeth to be brittle.  That sounds awful.  But just in the right amount, it's okay.  Beautiful.  We should mention, too, because there's only about an hour or so left to do this. 
[00:15:00]  Dr. Steve was telling me, speaking of medical issues, that he's very concerned about E-Rock's well-being,  being that he's so out of shape for this physical fitness challenge that's going down next week.  He's going to lose, but if you want to get behind one of us,  somebody is going to win $1,000 and box tickets to the 2011 Pocono 500 race events,  which are June 10th and 12th, but the last day to register is today, and that's at noon Eastern time. 
[00:15:30]  So if you're listening to the replay, you lost your shot, but if you're not, you can still enter SiriusXM.com slash the virus.  It's got all your information.  I would strongly recommend entering now while you still can.  For the odds makers, we were going to do sort of a preliminary evaluation of you and E-Rock and some of the other folks,  and, of course, we just trashed them.  Well, they got distracted by Stalker Patty's vagina once again.  It happens.  You want to?  Who should we go with, Dr. Steve? 
[00:16:00]  Oh, pick Blowhard.  Of course, the Brooklyn Blowhard.  Blowhard, you're on after O&A.  Hey, Samuel.  Hey, Doc.  Hey, man.  PAs.  Hey.  Hello.  Question.  My cousin was playing catch with his son who was a little league pitcher.  The kid throws the ball pretty hard, hits my cousin in the head, in the mouth, cuts his lips, no teeth damage, but he loses his hearing.  What do you think happened there?  Yeah.  He's totally, he, it's like, sort of like when you're on a plane and your ears get clogged, and it's been about a week and a half now, 
[00:16:30]  and it's really freaking him out that he's deaf from getting hit with a ball, because the kid really brings it.  The kid throws the ball about 80 miles an hour.  He's 16, and, uh...  Well, let me answer your question.  Any time you get a neurologic effect, like hearing loss after a trauma like that, you need to, um...  Oh, did you hang up on him?  Yeah, you told me to.  Oh.  Sorry.  You did. 
[00:17:00]  Blowhard, you told me to hang up.  I meant while I was talking.  Oh, I thought you just wanted to...  No, I was going to answer his question, then have him talk, because you knew he was going to, and then cut him off.  Sorry.  That's my...  See, that's why I needed control of the board.  Well, now you're not even answering his question.  Any time you get a neurologic deficit after a trauma like that, it needs to be checked out.  But I will pretty much guarantee you that what happened is he had bleeding into his, uh, eardrum.  That's what I would assume.  I'm not a doctor. 
[00:17:30]  Right.  But I would assume that when you get hit with a baseball and then your ears get clogged for a while, something bled in there.  Yeah.  Uh...  So, but he needs to see, uh, an ear, nose, and throat.  And there's a thing.  What's the deal with the battle sign?  That's for the...  Yeah, the skull fracture.  So that's the...  A skull fracture.  Now, do you have...  Bruising behind the ear.  That's bruising behind the ear.  So if he doesn't have that, then it's less likely that it's a skull fracture that bled into his middle ear.  Right.  But he needs to get it checked out.  Or he could have a dislocation of his, uh, stapes. 
[00:18:00]  Yep, that's true.  What is that?  That's a small bone in the ear.  And you can have that dislocate or move.  And then the conduction from sound.  The ears are such a scary...  Where are their bones in the ear?  Right in the middle ear.  Yeah.  So, like, they could just...  Because I feel like you can't fix them.  Because they're so hard to get to.  You could do surgery for it.  But they're very tiny bones.  The smallest...  Three smallest bones in the ear.  And if something happens to the bones in the...  Can it...  It would permanently...  Even with surgery.  Can it, like, permanently affect... 
[00:18:30]  Depends on which bone.  It depends on what the problem is.  Ears are scary.  The inside in there.  Because you can't...  And you don't know.  Like, can you break a bone just poking around in there?  If you puncture the tympanic membrane, the little eardrum, what you would consider the eardrum.  Yeah, if you're just shoving things in your ears, yeah.  Yeah, because my grandfather has terrible earwax and walks around with pencils in his ears.  I mean, he's in his 80s at this point.  He's an old man.  But, yeah, he literally walks around the house with pencils in his ears.  Yeah, don't stick shit in your ears.  The best thing is, you know, a murine ear kit to blast the... 
[00:19:00]  You can do it just like they do in the doctor's office and save yourself 125 bucks.  You don't think the lead end of a pencil works just as well?  Not so much.  Who do you like, Dr. Steve?  I won't hang up on him this time.  Okay, now that was my fault.  How about Bob in Pennsylvania?  Bob, you're on After One with Weird Medicine.  I say, don't let him get you down.  I love your 10 to 11 show.  It's awesome.  Thank you so much.  Anyway, Dr. Steve, about three and a half years ago, I had an anal abscess. 
[00:19:30]  And I had the surgery.  I had to go through all the, you know, foot and stuffing.  You know, my wife had to do all that happy horse shit.  Now, I still have a whole, I'm going to say maybe two centimeters in diameter,  where the surgery was, you know, done at.  And about every 30 to 45 days, I feel like a woman.  Because I have, you know, I have drainage coming out of it. 
[00:20:00]  The reminder.  Is that normal?  I mean, is that supposed to happen?  I don't understand.  I would say that's probably not normal.  That should heal.  That's what I would have said, too.  Next question.  I mean, obviously, you have a little sinus left there.  And it could be connecting to your rectum, which would make it a fistula.  So you could be having some bowel material kind of coming, like you said, building up and then coming out of that area.  It's like a little fleshy tube that comes from the rectum to the outside. 
[00:20:30]  And rather than just collecting in the soft tissue, it works its way out.  And so now you've got what we call an ostium on the outside that's draining this thing.  What do you say?  Vowel material collecting.  Is that shit?  Yeah.  Okay.  I didn't know if it was like pieces of flesh.  It's like blood and pus.  Yeah.  And the fact that it's draining is probably good.  Because if it wasn't draining, you would be developing another abscess. 
[00:21:00]  But you should go back to your surgeon and have them look at that because they should be able to fix it.  It will require another procedure.  But they will be able to do a fistulotomy and open it up and clean it out so it doesn't happen.  What do they call it in the old days?  Do surgeons still do this where you put a wire in there going through?  What you do is you take a wire and you thread it in through that fistula tract from the outside all the way into the rectum.  And then you pull it out the rectum and then you tie it off. 
[00:21:30]  And then you keep tightening it and tightening it.  And there's a name for that.  And I can't remember what it is.  Painful?  Yeah.  Sounds accurate.  Well, you know, I've been out of general surgery for five years.  But when I was still doing that, we were still doing that same type of procedure.  However, we would use like an electrocautery to use your fistula finder basically and go through and find the track.  And then you would just burn through it and then debride the area and then you just basically let it heal afterwards.  So we weren't twisting and tearing. 
[00:22:00]  That sounds bad.  Yeah, the twisting thing.  Of course, you'd be asleep during this.  Jesus.  Well, thank you, Dr. Steve.  Okay, man.  Good luck with it.  We've got time for like maybe one more quick call.  Okay, let's do Mike in Florida because he needs an answer to this.  Okay.  You're a very giving person, Dr. Steve.  Mike, you're on a...  Hey, how y'all doing?  Good, man.  Yeah, I was diagnosed with it about a year ago and I've gone through like three tests.  And the doctor...  Diagnosed with what?  It's monoclonal gammopathy.  Okay.  What is that?  It's a precursor. 
[00:22:30]  It doesn't mean you're going to get anything, but it's a precursor for...  Okay, thank you.  Leukemia and...  Well, we've got a real short time, Mike, so I'll give you the answer because on the screen it said you've got this and should you worry.  What this is is...  And what's it called again?  It's monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance with the emphasis being on uncertain significance.  Okay.  What it is is they've detected this in his bloodstream and he has a spike of a single protein.  And it's basically an antibody or a fragment of an antibody that his body is making in excess. 
[00:23:00]  Now, what I'll tell you is 80% of people who have that will go on and live their lives and have no problem whatsoever.  Between 15% and 20% will turn into another disease called multiple myeloma.  And that's...  You know, the odds are overwhelming in your favor that this will not happen to you.  But the 20% is high enough that you need to go back every year and get it checked.  What's multiple myeloma?  Multiple myeloma is a... 
[00:23:30]  It's a tumor of the bone marrow, basically.  Blood cancers.  Go for the 80%, Mike.  Yeah.  Go for the 80%.  No shit, huh?  And good luck with it, man.  Thank you.  But don't skip on getting checked.  No, I don't.  It's just a...  You know, you worry about it a lot the week before and the week after.  And I've got to do it three times a year.  Yeah.  But anyway, all right.  I appreciate the input.  Okay, man.  Thanks, buddy.  Good luck.  Who's on the board?  Who's on the board? 
[00:24:00]  Real quick, Dr. Steve.  Answer this one just because I'm curious.  Eli.  Somebody go on the board because there's a thing.  Eli, you're on the after show.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  Sometimes when I take a really good shit, I cum a little bit.  And it's not a lot.  Just a little bit comes out.  And it's usually never close to having sex.  It'll be a day after.  I've gone to the bathroom a few other times.  Right.  And I'm just wondering why. 
[00:24:30]  Is it just that some shits are just that pleasurable?  Absolutely.  What you're having is some prostatic congestion.  I would bet that this is happening when you are, you know, a couple of days out of having sex.  I think you said that, actually.  Yeah.  So, you know, if you had just had sex, it's unlikely this would happen.  But what's your prostate is enlarged a little bit.  And then you're having probably an American diet with hard stools passing past the prostate. 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  Remember, the back part of the prostate is the front part of the rectum.  So when that stool passes by, you compress the prostate and some fluid will come out.  But you're not having an orgasm.  I think you've already figured that one out.  Unless sometimes, you know.  It doesn't go for everybody.  And, you know, we can express fluid by compressing people's prostates.  And we'll do that.  If you need a sample of prostatic fluid, you stick your finger in the person's rectum. 
[00:25:30]  You sweep it left and right and down the middle.  And lo and behold, out of their penis will come a milky fluid that you can then look at under the microscope and see if it's infected.  We'd love to get to all your calls, but we're not going to have time.  Weird Medicine is starting next week, Saturdays at 10 p.m. Eastern.  And what's the number?  What they do is, since it's not live, you call up their voicemail.  It's not a live phone.  It's a voicemail box.  But you leave the voicemail.  They play your voicemails on the air. 
[00:26:00]  It's just like you're calling in.  It's very entertaining.  What's the phone number?  Well, you can go to drsteve.com.  Okay.  And the phone number's there.  It's 347-766-4323 or 347-Poo-Head.  Club Soda Kenny, I see you're on hold, but we have to go.  The time's up.  What's up, Kenny?  I just want to tell Dr. Steve he misdiagnosed that guy.  If he's got cum coming out of his asshole, the guy's a faggot.  Thank you for having me, Kenny.  God damn it. 
[00:26:30]  Yeah, man.  You don't have to be a doctor to figure that out.  All right.  Thank you very much, Club Soda.  I mean, is it bad if you got a lump on your balls?  Yes.  I think it is.  Of course it is.  Thank you, Kenny.  Show it to me next time.  All right.  Unfortunately, we're out of time.  We'll save it for another show.  They're saying you have to go.  Have a good day anyway.  No, you go.  All right.  Goodbye.  E-Rock, before we go, apologize for what you did.  You missed Ron Bennington's cue.  Sorry. 
[00:27:00]  I was answering the phones and doing everything else back here because I'm all by myself.  Well, you were supposed to be producing.  I do apologize.  Why don't you guys have interns anymore?  Well, Dr. Steve, I would get into that.  Okay.  But we have to let Ron and Fez take over.  I don't know if Ron Bennington's ever going to do the show.  He went on Ron and Fez yesterday and said he wasn't doing this show anymore.  Yeah.  I wish I could have gotten to the bottom of that.  Stay tuned.  Ron and Fez is coming up next.  Weird Medicine.  Oh, by the way, the Joe Rogan marathon's on Sunday, so listen to that.  But Weird Medicine is starting next Saturday, 10 p.m. Eastern, and we'll see you back here
