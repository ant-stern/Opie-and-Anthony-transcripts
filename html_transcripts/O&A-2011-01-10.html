<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast began with the hosts' characteristically profane and energetic greetings.  They immediately transitioned to a discussion about one host's powerful fireplace, capable of melting metal fireplace racks, before shifting to a celebratory recap of a recent New York Jets victory, including commentary on a host's tweet proclaiming a player a "folk hero."  The conversation then took a serious turn, focusing extensively on the shooting of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.  The hosts discussed the shooter's background, online presence, motivations, and the ensuing political debate surrounding gun control and the media's role in covering the event. A caller from Arizona, who knew the shooter from his daughter's high school, offered his perspective.  The discussion then veered into a conversation about the recent deaths of various animal species (birds, crabs, penguins), prompting speculation about potential causes and whether the media was over-sensationalizing the issue.  Patrice O'Neal, a guest throughout much of the show, contributed to this segment, questioning the media's focus and tendency toward sensationalism.  The show continued with a discussion about Ted Williams, the homeless man with a remarkable voice, exploring the societal factors contributing to his homelessness, including the intersection of mental illness and media attention.  The political implications of the Giffords shooting and the subsequent gun control debate were also revisited.

The show continued with a segment heavily featuring comedian Rich Vos. The discussion began with a brief tangent about the Second Amendment before focusing on Vos's experience with a subpar hotel room at a New Year's Eve gig at Mohegan Sun. This led to a broader discussion about Vos's career choices, financial decisions, and compromises made as a working comedian with a family.  O'Neal frequently interjected with humorous and offensive remarks about Vos's perceived frugality.  Topics ranged from college debt and the low pay of pilots to the perceived unfairness of capitalism.  The conversation included discussion of a ridiculously expensive portrait commissioned for a benefit Vos participated in.  A significant portion was dedicated to football, specifically the New England Patriots and the New York Jets, with racially charged commentary about players.  Other sports, including golf, were discussed, leading to jokes about Vos allegedly cheating.  The segment ended with playful banter and insults between the hosts and guests.

A subsequent segment focused on Voss's spending habits and his tendency to negotiate deals, particularly regarding his Rolex watch.  The hosts and O'Neal debated the legitimacy of his claims, leading to sarcastic and combative exchanges. The discussion veered into Voss's insecurities, fueled by negative Twitter feedback, and a tangential discussion of psychology where Voss's attempts to explain basic psychological principles were met with mockery. A phone call from Voss's mother provided a humorous contrast to the earlier harsh exchanges.  The segment concluded with a more serious, albeit chaotic, discussion about breaking cycles of family dysfunction.

Another segment featured a speaker describing his childhood experiences with arson and his mother's physically abusive disciplinary methods.  He explained how his mother's beatings, while instilling fear, ultimately helped him stop his arson.  The discussion expanded into a debate on parenting styles, with the speaker advocating for stricter discipline and referring to children as "things." A video showing an uncle physically disciplining his nephew for pretending to be a gang member online was shown and discussed.  Patrice O'Neal was a guest in this segment.  The conversation shifted to movie reviews, focusing on *True Grit*, *3:10 to Yuma*, *Winter's Bone*, *The Other Guys*, and *Black Swan*, with differing opinions and often vulgar commentary. Musician Ryan Starr was also a guest, playing at the end of the segment.

The show concluded with a segment opening with a discussion about oral sex and the taste of semen.  The conversation then focused on critiques of Rich Vos, described as intellectually shallow.  Ryan Starr joined the show, and the hosts discussed his career, marriage, and recent success, with sexually suggestive comments from Opie. Ryan performed his songs "Brandy Day" and "Start a Fire."  The discussion returned to the hosts' banter and insults toward Voss, with mentions of controversial tweets.  Patrice O'Neal joined again to promote his comedy special.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Wake the fuck up!  What the fuck is going on?  We're waking you up.  You ought to love it.  It's a privilege to hear our voices.  This is so cool.  This is fucking hysterically funny.  Oh, this is good radio right here.  Yeah, fuck yeah.  Fuck yeah!  One minute you're acting like an intelligent guy,  the next minute you're acting like a big giant ass.  He's got a giant farm!  Oh my God!  It's fucking brilliant, man.  Really funny shit.  Arousing in perverse and interesting ways.  It's like an audio rake. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, it's amazing.  This is the best show ever.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The most popular show in the history of satellite radio.  But enough of this palaver!  Let's get the show on the road!  Yeah, let's fucking do this.  Good morning, welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Hi.  Hope everyone had a great weekend.  Hi, folks.  Did you have a great weekend?  Oh, yes.  Weekends are always good.  What was the best part of your weekend?  Sleeping late.  Sleeping late? Nice.  Staying up late.  Nice.  Uh, and that's about it. 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  I'm watching lots of TV and poking at my fire in the fireplace.  Little poke, poke, poke.  It's a joy.  I go through, like, two cords of wood every, like, two weeks.  Jesus.  It's insane.  Well, you got a fire going all the time, every day then, huh?  Constant!  And it's very hot.  Like, I like a nice, hot fireplace.  I don't like just a little, um, crackling little fire in the fireplace.  You want something blazing.  I get an inferno going.  Right.  To the point where I had to get a, uh, you know the rack, the metal racks that go on the 
[00:01:30]  bottom of your fireplace?  I had to get a bigger, thicker one made of heavier steel because I melted the other metal  rack in there.  It, it just melted.  That's a fire, my friends.  That is a good fire.  I like that.  I like a good, especially, you know, obviously in winter, you know, I don't, I don't, uh,  start many fires in the, in the summer there, but, uh, the winters and, and then when it  was, uh, we had the, the blizzard the other day and then a little bit of snow the other  day.  It's just nice to light a fire and the snow's falling. 
[00:02:00]  And we got another snow storm hitting us tomorrow.  Yes.  Well, the best part of my weekend, cause I know you want to ask, was, uh, the big Jets  victory, Anthony.  Oh, the bleed Jets.  Our team, uh, pulled it out over the Colts.  Yeah.  You liked the game?  Yeah.  Yeah.  I, uh, I enjoyed watching the clips.  I see you're dressed in all green today in honor of the Jets victory.  Jack Green.  Jack Green all over the place.  Oh, yeah.  I bleed it.  Bleed it.  Stupid Colts. 
[00:02:30]  I knew we would get past the Colts.  That was an easy one.  You knew that, huh?  I went down to the last second.  Of course, I didn't know that.  Like, uh, and then I, I tweeted really quickly that, uh, Nick Folk is now a folk hero.  Yeah.  And it was obvious how I tweeted it, that it was a douchey joke.  Uh-huh.  And I tweeted that because I know all the papers would go with folk hero.  Yes.  Someone with folk lore and someone with hell folk.  Hell folk.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:03:00]  Uh, folk.  Folk.  Yeah.  Sorry.  Oh, still early.  Oh, yeah.  Almost like the fuckers.  Right.  Of course.  The folkers.  No, the fuckers.  Fuckers.  I told you, I don't play that game.  The fuckers.  So it was fuck yeah.  Little fuckers was, uh, second at the box office.  Thank God.  That means it's taken its plunge out of the top five.  Finally.  It's still on the fucking page.  It shouldn't even be there.  So I, uh, I tweeted that as a joke.  Bob Costas uses it on national TV.  He didn't, he didn't rip me off. 
[00:03:30]  Trust me.  I'm not that stupid, but he actually went with the hacky joke as a real, as a real, as a real line.  I mean, you know, that he's now a folk hero.  So big victory though.  Big victory for the jets.  That is bring on the Pats.  They move on to, uh, the Pats.  Yeah.  And, and like I said, uh, about a month ago, Rex Ryan, brilliant letting the Pats blow them  out 45 to three.  Give them a false sense of security.  Yes.  Their guard is way the fuck down.  They're sitting there up there in, uh, in, in, uh, in the Boston area going, ah, this is 
[00:04:00]  going to be an easy victory for us.  They have nothing to lose.  Tell you the truth.  If, uh, the, uh, Pats win, people will be like, well, it's the Pats.  They beat him.  And then if, uh, the Jets win, forget about it.  They look like, uh, heroes.  Of course.  They look like folk heroes.  Although, uh, although Sanchez might, might have an injury.  That could be a major problem this weekend.  Oh, well.  He's got a little shoulder thing happening that needs a little surgery.  Ah, his quarterback really needs a shoulder.  I guess you didn't watch the game.  No.  He was throwing to eight foot receivers.  Oh, was he? 
[00:04:30]  Oh, yeah, he was.  A few over the head.  We're actually really lucky we got past the Colts because, uh, it's obvious Sanchez is hurting  a little bit.  But, uh, I say bring on the Pats.  Bring on Brady.  Let's see what happens.  Doug from Boston saying they're going to wish they lost to the Colts.  Oh, really?  Already the rhetoric kicking up.  Watch out for rhetoric.  That gets people killed.  Rhetoric is amazing.  Yeah, that's a, that's a big catch word, uh, over the weekend.  Rhetoric.  Right.  And that's another tweet I did.  I, I pointed out that Sarah Palin had the targets on her map. 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And all I said was, wow, that's interesting.  Meaning I didn't know about this because I don't really follow politics.  Yeah.  And these assholes coming out of the fucking woodwork going, oh, you're just like the  rest of them.  You're just like the rest of the left or the right.  Cause they weren't sure which side it was coming from.  Right, right.  And I'm like, Hey asshole.  I, I worded my tweet carefully.  So it wasn't political.  And I just said, wow, this is interesting.  Meaning a lot of people are going to be talking about the fact that Sarah Palin had a map with 
[00:05:30]  a bunch of fucking gun targets.  And one of the, one of the fucking people that she targeted got shot in the head.  That's going to cause discussion.  That's all I said.  You know, it's up to everyone else to decide if, if that's why the, the fucking whack job  did that or not.  It's too early to tell what his motivation was.  I read his, uh, I read his, uh, uh, dossier, his dossier, his, uh, he had his YouTube videos.  Manifesto?  Yeah.  He had YouTube videos that were all text. 
[00:06:00]  I saw that.  They were just fading in and out text.  I was trying to read that shit and it was really hard to follow.  I had to read like all of them.  Right.  And, uh, it is the such typical schizophrenic psychobabble.  The guy was a nut and still is.  He's in custody.  I guess he's, uh, appearing before, uh, uh, for arraignment today.  And, um, he, he's, he's a cook.  You read his shit.  He's, he's a fucking lunatic.  Right.  And that's why he shot her and, and other people completely agree. 
[00:06:30]  Um, I don't see any, any, uh, sensible, uh, reason, uh, for him to do this, this politically  motivated.  He's a cook.  Yes.  He's a fucking cook.  Yes, absolutely.  And he said, I mean, he said it was mind control.  They're saying he's from the left.  They're saying he's from the right.  They're saying he's a T.  It's, it's all over the fucking place.  It was mind control.  Mind control.  He did have mind control in his video. 
[00:07:00]  That's it.  They see, he's saying, uh, mind control.  Did you see the other one, uh, where he had the hood on with the fucking mask?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Was cranking.  And then he goes and burns the American flag and, and like the kind of cactusy desert.  Just this fucking me, me, me lunatic fucking, uh, there.  Now you got your, you got your fame.  Good.  I hope you're happy getting a giant cocks in you, in your asshole.  Right.  Uh, when you go to prison, Sam and Dave, uh, blamed, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, 
[00:07:30]  conservatives on special delivery.  Oh, they're ratting out to decide Dave and, uh, Sam, our own Sam Roberts blame conservatives.  They did, huh?  Um, well, a lot of people saying, like we said, the rhetoric, a lot of people blaming the rhetoric  that comes.  It was in some of these, um, news talk shows, opinion shows, uh, they're blaming the rhetoric.  I don't understand what, what that's all about, but.  Well, I mean, rhetoric has been part of politics for a long time. 
[00:08:00]  I don't understand.  I'm not, I'm not a fan of Sarah Palin, but.  I'm not either.  I fucking hate her, actually.  I'm definitely not a fan of Sarah Palin.  No.  She goes shit in her hat for all I care.  Yeah.  I, uh, I don't like her.  I hope she goes away before the, uh, the next election.  Cause she is a fucking, she is a destroyer for the Republican Party if she gets involved  in any way, shape, or form in the presidential election in two years.  A destroyer.  Just stay the fuck out. 
[00:08:30]  You're useless.  I don't like you.  Uh, you think the, you think this, um, attempted assassination, I guess we have to call it,  of the Congresswoman is going to start a new trend.  Uh, with what?  I think there's other whack jobs out there that are going to attempt the same exact fucking  thing.  Oh, copycat stuff?  Yeah.  Just like the school shootings a few years back.  One guy does it.  Next thing you know, it's, it becomes the hot thing to do for a while.  Well, I certainly hope not.  Uh, and I, I blame, I definitely blame the media on that.  They make, they make these guys look like rock stars, heroes, you know, most, more people 
[00:09:00]  knew the name of, uh, the douchebag than the Congresswoman by the end of, uh, the coverage  on the weekend.  Yeah.  They, uh, they really pump it up.  Uh, they get people yapping about it, like the rhetoric part and, and they show his, his  Facebook, his YouTube, his pictures, his yearbook picture, everything comes out.  Mm-hmm.  And, um, and then it starts the debate again on, uh, guns and gun control.  I was, I was tweeting last night till the early, uh, morning hours. 
[00:09:30]  Uh, and, and it's, it's one of these arguments that you're never going to change anyone's  mind.  I know that, but you just kind of throw some shit in there and try to sound sensible.  She liked her guns.  Yeah.  She was in the guns.  Gabriel, uh, Giffords, right?  Is it Giffords?  Giffords.  Uh, she liked her guns.  Yeah.  Well, then the NRA wasn't a big fan of her cause she decided that, uh, people shouldn't  be allowed to have guns in bars.  Yeah.  That was her line.  Everyone has kind of their line with guns and everything else. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  Hers was, I like guns a lot.  I carry, but I don't really think it would be great if guns were in bars.  That was her thing.  So the NRA, uh, officially not a big fan of hers, even though she was into guns and liked  her guns.  Some people, some people want absolute gun control where the second amendment is repealed  and no one is allowed to have guns and other people want, uh, uh, zero restriction, anything 
[00:10:30]  you want, buy it, carry it, whatever.  Uh, there's a, a happy medium that neither side wants to, to, to meet.  And, and when I was, um, tweeting with a lot of, uh, gun, gun control advocates last night,  um, a lot of them don't want to hear, you know, about, uh, uh, compromise.  They just want to legislate against, uh, people that are legal, responsible gun owners. 
[00:11:00]  That's always what happens.  Somebody even said it, um, I can't remember who it was, but said anytime there's a, a,  a shooting, a rampage, whatever it is, uh, the, the lawmakers get in line to make laws  against people that didn't do it, you know, and just.  Did, did that guy, uh, I don't like saying his name, did that guy get his gun legally?  Uh, yeah, yeah.  He, you know, in, in Arizona, you're able to walk into a store.  He did the background check and, uh, they sold him a gun, even though he, uh, he had 
[00:11:30]  an arrest, a drug arrest.  He had some, some issues with his mental health, um, things like that.  Now that, um, should be looked into.  Yeah.  Kooks shouldn't fucking be able to get their hands on guns.  Right.  Sorry.  But, uh, but again, that could be something that is subjective and interpreted by someone  who, what, what is it that would make somebody, um, nutty enough to not be able to buy a gun? 
[00:12:00]  Is it, uh, you've been institutionalized.  All right.  Or do you keep going down the line till, uh, you know, have you ever seen a therapist?  All right.  Now you can't get one.  It's like, meanwhile, I think 90% of the people have, have seen therapists.  Uh, I, I, I don't know what the answer is for that one,  but I certainly know the answer isn't more gun control on responsible gun owners. 
[00:12:30]  Um, I brought up a point last night, Chicago for years and years and years, Chicago,  you can't have a gun in Chicago.  You're not allowed as a citizen.  If you want to adhere to the law to have a gun, you can't do it.  That is the strictest form of gun control you could have.  You're not allowed to have one.  They can't go, let's make gun laws in Chicago stricter.  Oh, how you already not allowed to have one legally.  Right.  Yet the gun violence in Chicago tops the list every fucking year as the most violent, uh, 
[00:13:00]  city for gun violence in the country.  So it doesn't work.  And then other cities where, um, even Tucson, uh, has amongst the lowest murder rates by  guns and you're allowed to go in and buy them.  And occasionally shit like this happens.  Sorry.  People buy cars and plow into other people with them and kill people.  What about, uh, Dallas? 
[00:13:30]  I know a little bit about Dallas.  I used to spend a little time down there and, uh, wow.  Everyone is carrying.  Everyone's carrying.  I mean, everybody.  Everyone's carrying.  I don't know the crime stats, but I assure you that the Dallas implants and guns, that's  Dallas and especially legal gun owners, uh, murdering people in Dallas, uh, probably  a fuck of a lot lower than illegal gun owners, murdering them in cities where, uh, there's  strict gun control.  Uh, someone was giving me shit last night about, uh, you know, Oh, relax.  No one's taking your guns, Anthony. 
[00:14:00]  And it's like, you know what?  But it's one of these situations where they'll go after one thing and once that's, they get  that, they'll go after something else and something else.  No one stops.  When you have an organization that, uh, is, is there for, uh, this, this political purpose  and this one being a strict gun control laws, they don't get something and then disband.  They move on to the next thing.  So if they made regulations where it was tougher for somebody to get a gun, which, which people  would agree with, the next step is something worse and the next step and the neck, and 
[00:14:30]  then, uh, you're, you're not able to buy a certain amount of ammunition and you can't  buy certain guns.  Uh, somebody said also, what's the, uh, what's the use of having an AR 15?  Uh, it's not a hunting rifle.  It's a rifle to hunt people.  It's a, there's no use for it.  There's no use for a 30 round magazine.  There's no, you, you know what?  There's no use for a beautiful fucking 69 GTO either. 
[00:15:00]  Uh, that's just been blown out and, and, and, and looks, sounds and runs like a motherfucker.  But people like to have them.  Should we all just get a Prius?  Should we all just get the new leaf electric car?  You did some reading this week.  It's fucking, yeah.  I've never heard this angle before.  It's crazy.  It's we, should we all have the same safest thing, uh, just to make everybody safe. 
[00:15:30]  There's reasons people buy certain guns.  Enthusiasts.  Enthusiasts.  They're fun to shoot.  It's a great recreation.  It doesn't always have to be for hunting and self-defense.  I like guns because they're fun to go to the range and challenge yourself, um, at shooting  targets at distance.  It's a fun hobby and certain guns are fun to shoot.  Uh, you don't have to, you don't have to fucking tell me why I need to own a fucking gun that 
[00:16:00]  it's gotta be for hunting or it's gotta be for self-defense and no other reason.  I like it cause it's fun and, and, and believe me, it's my fucking right to own it.  Obviously we get it.  You love guns.  So what, what's the solution here?  Oh, I don't have a fucking solution.  I'm not the fucking guy.  I, uh, I know I, I support gun laws.  No, that obviously, obviously doesn't.  I mean, not tougher gun laws, uh, tougher, uh, tougher penalties for the people that break 
[00:16:30]  gun laws.  That is the answer, not brand new legislation, not making it more difficult for citizens in  this country, law abiding citizens to get, uh, their, their right, their second amendment  right to exercise it by owning a firearm.  Um, yeah, some guy told me, he goes, don't worry, they're not coming after your guns.  It's like, no, not in this step maybe, or maybe they are.  I don't know.  But I said, oh really?  And then he said, um, I have an imagined, uh, uh, gun control problem. 
[00:17:00]  Like this, it's this imagined thing.  I go, oh, I imagine it.  I go, okay, bring a gun.  Uh, try to exercise your second amendment right in New York city right now.  Go ahead.  I go, enjoy your two year mandatory in prison.  If you try to exercise your imagined fucking, uh, gun control, uh, it really is infuriating.  That people are so willing to just throw away their right, whether they like it or not. 
[00:17:30]  You don't have to have a gun.  No one's telling you to buy one.  Uh, but, but as a responsible legal gun owner, it's my right and leave me alone.  Don't restrict me.  Um, uh, don't tell me, uh, I have to be restricted to what I get.  Um, how many I can buy in a month, uh, how many, how much ammunition I could procure.  People are going to kill people.  People are going to kill people on a daily basis because that's what people do. 
[00:18:00]  There are evil, evil people out there that just want to kill people for one reason or another.  Right.  Uh, a lot of motive, uh, motives out there, but they will kill people, whether it's with  a knife, um, driving a car into a crowd of fucking people or with a gun.  It's just going to happen.  And there'll be arguing this point for another year or two and nothing really will change  either way.  So absolutely. 
[00:18:30]  It'll just be a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.  Uh, uh, what about Sarah Palin?  Does this ruin her political career rant?  No, it doesn't ruin her political.  I don't know if she, I don't even know if she has one, you know, it's, they, like you  said, the news pumps a lot of shit up and makes a lot of shit obvious.  I know a lot of Republicans.  I know a lot of fucking tea party people that just don't like Sarah Palin.  She's a fucking, she's a pariah on the party.  Um, she, she's a jinx. 
[00:19:00]  She's a fucking albatross.  Get her away.  No one's, no one's embracing this woman.  So is the, but this is a nice place to kind of like try to push her out, right?  Push her out.  Well, I wouldn't like to see her.  I mean, the party knows how to push out their own.  I wouldn't like to see her made a scapegoat because that'll only spread amongst the party.  But, uh, but people have distance, sir.  You're not seeing anybody that's been elected embracing Sarah Palin, uh, and inviting them  to their district and, and, you know, inviting her to their district and, and, you know, pumping 
[00:19:30]  her up for, uh, two more years.  Just go away.  Just fucking, her show is just canceled, by the way, too.  Yeah.  Sarah Palin, who gives a shit what she does in Alaska.  I'm going to go hunt a moose show, whatever the fuck it was called.  So.  All right.  Enough of her.  Uh, a lot of people don't want to talk about guns.  Oh, they certainly do.  Uh, gun control doesn't mean anything with this case.  He would have done this regardless.  Yeah, he, he, he wind up getting a gun.  Uh, lives around the corner with the guy who did the shooting. 
[00:20:00]  Well, let's go to this person.  Joe in Arizona.  Joe, welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got, Joe?  Hello.  Yeah.  Everybody in my neighborhood knew this guy was nuts.  He didn't know he was this nut.  But he went to high school with my daughter.  She said she was always a weird fucker.  Oh, really?  He was the weirdo?  Well, we all know weirdos.  Yeah.  The weirdo.  So how do we know which weirdo is going to, you know, step, uh, step forward and do something  insane?  And be homicidal weirdo guy.  Right.  I saw him walking around the neighborhood. 
[00:20:30]  He never bothered anybody in the neighborhood, Joe.  He looked like one of those guys who was talking to himself, doing nutty things.  This is something we have to, uh, deal with in the country we live in.  We have a lot of freedoms in this country that can be, uh, abused and, uh, people will pay  consequences for it, whether it's, it's something simple or death.  It's horrible.  It's terrible.  But it's, it's what the consequences are of living in a country where we do have a second 
[00:21:00]  amendment, um, uh, and a first amendment freedom to speak of, of speech to, to say, uh, things  like this rhetoric that they're talking about, it's protected speech.  Uh, and the first thing people want to do when something like this happens is start scooping  up rights.  I, I wish we could have blamed rhetoric over the years.  Yeah, please.  Can we blame rhetoric?  Any other business you're in, you use a little rhetoric, you're so fired rhetoric, but in 
[00:21:30]  politics, I think, uh, I think you got a little more leeway.  Yeah.  I really do.  Arizona gun laws come under scrutiny.  It says, how about the nine year old girl?  Fucking Christina Taylor green born on nine 11, 2001.  That's terrible.  Of course it worked out that way.  That's fucking terrible.  Just horrible.  Um, the boys brought in a, um, a woman somber post shooting interview that gets a little,  a little weird.  Somber.  It's a, it's a quick thing.  Listen to this. 
[00:22:00]  And then I decided that wasn't, that wasn't going to help.  And so I just asked the other man to sit on his ankles and I went to get a, a compress  for him.  And, uh, and I stayed, the hell was that?  Is that someone's phone going off?  Oh yeah, it was during the interview.  Yeah.  Just a horrible ringtone going off. 
[00:22:30]  That's some bad timing.  And what did the guys say?  Oh, I'll call you back.  Oh shit.  He's a, I'll call you back.  Listen again.  And then I decided that wasn't, that wasn't going to help.  And so I just asked the other man to sit on his ankles and I went to get a, a compress  for him.  And I, and I stayed.  I'll call you back, fucking asshole. 
[00:23:00]  Well, fuck, put it on vibrate, asshole.  That's so many fucking, just a little tweet argument going on last night with some people.  It was, uh, it was fascinating.  Just that people, just people not really understanding my point, me not understanding their point.  Debate will go on forever.  That's the way of the world.  Until we just don't have any rights left or we, it's anarchy. 
[00:23:30]  One or the other.  I try to avoid debate because that's what happens.  It's just waiting for your turn to talk.  There's never listening going on in any fucking debate.  You're not going to get people going, oh, wow.  I didn't think of it that way.  No, they're just waiting.  They just keep looking at your lips.  All right.  I think he's done.  Yeah.  All right.  Now this is what I have to say about it.  Time for my rhetoric.  There's never a, oh, that's kind of interesting.  Or, oh, that's a good point.  Let me think about it.  Well, I don't agree with you, but that was, that's kind of, I got to think more on that. 
[00:24:00]  Never.  Can't be bothered.  What's up, Patrice O'Neal?  Patrice O'Neal.  Huh?  What was that?  Just waking up, getting ready?  What's going on?  Getting ready for the big radio show.  Just talking about crazy white guy crime.  I wasn't listening.  Come on, folks.  I'm listening to you.  All right.  All right.  Good morning.  Yeah.  Good morning.  I didn't, I was trying to be quiet.  We're just trying to do the, we're just trying to do the whole weekend wrap-up thing.  You got the big shooting in Arizona.  Somebody got shot?  You know.  Come on.  I didn't pay attention.  I, I, this is one of those things that, you know. 
[00:24:30]  How do you not pay attention?  It's everywhere.  You just go, you're just disgustingly not informed on it, and you just go, it just didn't  hit me.  Yeah.  This guy, this shooting and thing, I don't even know who died and what's going on.  And then I found a woman.  Congresswoman.  I was really, I was really torn.  The birds and shit was getting me.  Stop at the birds.  We, we had the, the whole world.  I don't, the whole fucking world.  We had the explanation on Friday.  We're moving past the birds.  Yes.  Oh, did you?  Someone show me.  I wasn't fucking here.  That's why you was paying attention.  Yeah. 
[00:25:00]  Fucking.  I'm just busting your balls.  Fucking fuck with me for paying attention to what I want to pay attention to.  The end of the apocalypse fucking is interesting to me.  Michu Kaku explained it perfectly on Friday.  He's an ass when it comes to that shit.  He is playing shit.  And probably the reason why the birds have been dying all over the world is because there's  been a lot of fireworks in the last week or so for the New Year's.  Birds, 50,000 crabs in fucking UK.  Penguins are washing up.  So out of nowhere this is happening?  It's not just fucking shitty fish in Maryland. 
[00:25:30]  It's the planet.  You know what it is?  What do you think it is?  It's that we've been so good to these animals over the years and kept them so healthy that  there's so many of them now that they're just fucking getting killed.  Manatees used to get run over by speed boats all the time.  Patrice.  All right, fuck it.  Patrice.  Fuck it.  Logically, with the whole birds in Arkansas thing, it was one species.  They were all flying together and they got fucking startled.  Something happened.  Someone show me a picture.  Someone show me a picture of this guy. 
[00:26:00]  The whole planet.  I don't know about the other shit.  You don't know about the other shit.  That's what makes it fuck up.  Hold on.  That's correct.  It's the other shit.  This happens all the time.  I think.  I'm not sure.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Did you hear of this?  Yes.  That's why I'm bringing it up.  There's a little pond.  Ant knows where it is.  It's a, what's the pond instead of poor?  Something kill.  Huh?  No.  What the fuck is it?  A mill pond, I guess.  Ten koi washed up?  I don't know.  Thousands and thousands where the whole fucking neighborhood stunk like holy hell for about 
[00:26:30]  a week or so.  It happens.  The whole world.  All right.  Shit's happening.  Let me just make.  I'm just saying.  Hold on.  Let me make my point and then you could.  Okay.  I think this happens all the time.  I really do.  I think what is going on here is the media likes to jump on something like shark attacks.  Name some of the other shit they've done over the years.  And all of a sudden it becomes the thing.  Earthquake?  Well.  Volcano?  And it becomes the thing to talk about where now all of a sudden you're saying, holy fuck,  what the fuck's going on with the world? 
[00:27:00]  That's my dumb two cents on this.  Someone showed me a picture of the sky in fucking Arkansas, wherever the fuck it was.  It is black.  Amazing how many of these fucking birds are in the sky.  It's covering the whole sky.  A few of them make a left.  I'm not arguing Arkansas.  I can go with that.  Yeah, but it's all over the world.  It's the world.  Yeah.  That's all I'm saying.  Like, I don't have a fucking...  But shit like that just...  I think because of what happened in Arkansas and then the media goes, oh, fuck,  Kreb's dead in Germany or wherever the fuck. 
[00:27:30]  And then they have to go with it.  Yeah, they start digging up.  I would love to talk to...  All I'm saying is I would love to talk to a scientist that actually watches this shit  all the time and not the media where they're going to watch it for the next week or two  and then move on to the next horse shit.  I just wonder if this type of thing happens all the time.  But it wasn't reported, but now it's the hot thing to report.  I don't know if it's the hot thing to report because they're not reporting the world.  They report in Arkansas.  And then they report in Maryland.  Because as you know, the United States is the world to most people.  So I'm just saying...  I don't even know if...  I'm just...  That's my question. 
[00:28:00]  That's all.  Once I see that it's like all kind of different species and all kind of different things  and it's all kind of different birds and all kind of different shit,  that's what makes me go, whew, that's strange.  I don't have...  I'm not Michu Kaku.  But I'm just saying, you know, some things you don't need to be told to feel a certain way.  I'm just saying...  Well, maybe the head crab, you know, led them all to their death.  Michu Kaku said one black bird, the leader, got a little confused and did a little header 
[00:28:30]  and everyone else follows because that's how they fucking lived their lives.  Well, Michu Kaku's whole point in his life is to say,  fuck anything that has to do with God.  So it's like anything...  Like this is...  If I wasn't so afraid of dying, I would love to see people who talk this shit living  and just see what happens when it all comes.  I just like to see his dumb head on fire running down the street  when whatever he tries to explain is just you foolish mortals.  Right, right.  And you're just like fucking...  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  And God just set his head on fire. 
[00:29:00]  Fucking crabs and penguins and manatees.  Painful.  It's strange.  I have questions, but I'm just wondering if this happens all the time.  That's the angle we need to take.  Somebody that knows this shit, a marine biologist or somebody, I don't know.  If this happens and we didn't hear...  Like at what point...  When the news has been less sensational in our life,  it's the most sensational now.  Yeah.  There was a time when the news was actually the fucking news.  Right.  And you get on the AP wire, millions of species of animals are dying all over the world. 
[00:29:30]  We've never heard it.  Even when news was news.  We've never heard...  Now they search it out.  They search out things that are in common with something here just so they could say like,  oh, look at that.  The birds died here.  All right.  Let's see if anything else is happening in the world.  Oh, some whales washed up on shore.  Let's talk about that.  And then the crab's dying.  And then this fucking fish, this pond.  And then you realize, oh, this shit was happening all the time. 
[00:30:00]  But now they're putting it all together in one story and making it seem a little, you know,  apocalyptic.  I think what happens with the news, they need one big incident to happen.  And then they're like, let's find more shit.  I mean, this homeless Ted Williams guy, right?  If it wasn't for the shooting in Arizona,  we were going to have a week or two of homeless fucking, homeless Charlie type stories.  Hey, mommy.  Hey, mommy.  But I'm just saying.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Don't make fun of my voice.  Yeah.  Hey. 
[00:30:30]  Hey, it's Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  I haven't seen my mother.  But you know what, though?  That motherfucker's voice is like...  It's silk.  He's smooth.  Yeah, but I keep thinking that his breath has to be horrendous.  Not anymore.  Not anymore is right.  Do you drink Scope?  Scope.  Yeah.  That is right.  If you have a problem with bad breath, get Scope.  You know, I was reading over the weekend that nine dentists are offering their services  to give them brand new teeth.  No, all nine at once, probably.  They don't want to get in there and work together. 
[00:31:00]  A super team.  I guarantee his teeth have something to do with that voice.  Don't fix your teeth in his head.  All of a sudden, he has a whistle because they fixed his teeth off.  Don't get your teeth fixed, Ted.  Got one of those.  Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  What would you do to my voice?  They've ruined his million dollar voice.  That motherfucker's going to be a millionaire by the end of the year.  God bless him.  Yeah, but we're thinking...  What happened to my filky voice?  My filky voice. 
[00:31:30]  Yeah, but there's something not right about the guy, but the media doesn't want to pay  attention to that part of it.  They don't want to pay attention to that.  They tried to get him.  They did try to get him.  It was the mini faces of whatever his name was.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They're all misdemeanors.  Yeah.  But what caused that?  Like, what is going on in this guy's head?  He's insane.  Okay, why aren't they really talking about it?  Because they don't want to fuck it up.  They don't want to make it scary.  Here's what it is.  Here's what it is.  Oprah offered him a gig on her Oprah Winfrey network and probably throwing that Oprah money 
[00:32:00]  at him and shit.  And I said this before.  He's crazy.  This guy...  Homeless people aren't people that...  Like, for the most part, there's a small percentage that lost their jobs, fell through  the cracks.  They're in shelters and trying to get out.  And they're like, I don't know what happened.  Now I'm homeless.  This sucks.  Most of them are homeless because they're fucking crazy.  They're just crazy people.  I would have to think I'm three friends' couches removed from homelessness. 
[00:32:30]  Yes.  I would.  I mean, if I wasn't crazy.  Right, right.  You know how much shit you got to fuck up to finally be on the street?  To finally be on the street.  To be, like, completely on the street.  You're right.  You're right.  You can lose your own home, but then there's always, like, family homes you could go to.  I would hope so.  Then they get sick of you, and then you go to maybe a friend's house for a little while.  Then you could possibly...  Maybe you could find a little shelter in the neighborhood, and then they fucking hate you,  and then finally you're homeless.  One Oprah Winfrey check away from the bottle again and fucking just doing shit. 
[00:33:00]  You can't hand a guy like that Oprah Winfrey money.  And his mother's disgusted.  His mother...  You didn't see the mother disgusted video?  She's like, like, he's going to disappoint me again.  Don't disappoint me.  No, no, before the mummy thing.  Oh, really?  Just her.  Her mummy.  Before he'd seen her again.  Right, right.  And she was just like he...  It was almost like she was warning the world against...  Oh, like, like, don't...  The wolf man, like...  Don't put this guy up on a pedestal, motherfuckers. 
[00:33:30]  Telling you he ain't shit.  He is a piece of shit.  She was saying that my son ain't shit.  Right.  She's had him.  And he hasn't seen it in 20 years.  Oh.  So she cut him off at 70, but he's only 50.  Yeah.  She's 90.  So at 70, her 30-year-old son made her that sick.  She said...  She was popping out kids at 72.  So something was wrong there, because that means she popped him out at 40. 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  I think he's a little older than 50.  Huh?  I think...  Oh, no.  Well, he said he's 50.  52 or something?  50.  Oh, whatever.  She's 90.  Like, 50.  He's 93, so...  And as he's going, hi, mommy, hi, mommy, she said, oh, hi, hi.  And then the second line was, please don't disappoint me again.  How much disappointment can you do?  If you're a 20-year-old guy and your mother's 12,000 years old, she can't discipline you.  She can't really...  She's just too old to do a lot of things. 
[00:34:30]  Yeah.  Like, I don't blame it all on Ted Williams.  It's just like...  He must have been just doing the drugs and robbing.  Man, she's super Christian.  She's Lordy Jesus.  I saw it.  Lordy.  She said, the product...  My product...  My prodigal...  Prodigal?  Or prod...  Prodigal son.  My prodigal son has returned.  So she's...  The Bible quotes.  Yeah, yeah.  He's insane.  Probably a lot to do from his crazy-ass Christian mother.  But she believed in him.  And he disappointed her.  And he was still working here and there. 
[00:35:00]  And he went to school.  Doing a local radio spot here.  Yeah.  A local thing here.  He went to smooth voice school.  Smooth voice school.  Yes, I did.  That voice is ridiculous.  I mean, he went to that school.  It's perfect.  And you know they're going to hire a don't fuck up guy.  Yeah, yeah.  Like, he's going to be around to go, Ted, look.  Dude, he's got people around him, right?  You think he's going to have a don't fuck up guy?  He's going to have to have a don't fuck up guy.  Because they're going to...  They're talking about a Super Bowl ad. 
[00:35:30]  God bless him.  He's got some fucking guys with some really nice suits around him already.  He hit the lottery.  They grabbed him up quickly.  And they're probably getting 70% of everything he makes.  And now they're doing like a homeless...  There's videos of just everybody trying to discover the next talent.  Dude.  Next homeless talent guy.  Hold on.  That brings me back to what I'm saying.  That's what the news does.  Now it's all about, wow, look at all these talented homeless people.  I didn't know there was so much talent out there with the homeless people.  It becomes the hot thing.  That's why I question if animals are all of a sudden dying or if it's just the hot thing right now for the media. 
[00:36:00]  And I don't have the answer to that.  I'm just throwing that in the discussion.  But they are dying, though.  Yeah, but have they been dying for the last 20, 30 years?  So you think there's a story of millions of fish that watch up on a show that we haven't heard about?  And no one touches.  Yes.  That maybe no one even gave a shit about.  It just didn't pop up?  In this world where you can't hide...  Or it did in the local news that day in Michigan or something.  But the CNN is too busy doing something else.  We really didn't have global news.  Fish are just too important to our food.  Yeah.  For millions of fish in Maryland. 
[00:36:30]  There's plenty of other ones in the city.  To wash up on shore and it means nothing.  Fish is like...  They're like bugs, though.  They're just everywhere.  Why would you say that?  Fish are everywhere.  But what are you basing that on?  Just your gut?  75% of the earth being covered with water.  There is fish.  That doesn't mean shit, though.  That doesn't mean that shit ain't dying often.  Have you spent time in the water?  Have you ever put a net in the water and see how much fish you could just scoop up in one fucking net?  No.  I'm just saying.  But who has?  They're everywhere.  They have to stop certain things because certain fish... 
[00:37:00]  Well, because those are the tasty ones.  They search out the tasty ones.  But salmon are grown in homes now.  Like, you can't find them in the ocean.  I understand.  But, Patrice, there's a lot of horrible-looking, horrible-tasting fish out there.  And we don't eat them.  I know.  So they don't count the shit that we might eat that washed up.  Yeah, we're depleting the fish that tastes good.  And the shit that tastes good probably eats the shit that is washing up on...  It's all fragile. 
[00:37:30]  There's a lot of irresponsibility on our part, certainly.  Yeah, yeah.  That's all I'm saying is you kind of made my point, sort of.  All of a sudden, now, it's all about the homeless guy that might have talent in your neighborhood.  And all the news crews are out there fucking filming their videos, hoping that they find the next Ted Williams.  But that was yanked off the front page and out of our TVs because of the shooting in Arizona.  So what about the guy, what about...  What did Howard Stern do?  Yeah, well, that's the dude, yeah.  Oh, geez.  His early picture from his yearbook or something. 
[00:38:00]  So now we're upset about this.  What did he do?  He killed...  He killed...  We really don't know.  Dude, I saw this guy's face.  I saw a shoot and my head completely, you know...  Just, oh, whatever.  I tried to keep up with Omar Thornton and no one wanted to keep up with him.  Like, I...  They just decided...  The black guy in Connecticut.  I tried to keep up with that.  I tried to make it news to me.  Wait, what's the black guy in Connecticut now?  Exactly.  Do you see?  Put him on.  Do you fucking see the exactly... 
[00:38:30]  Five times you said to me, how could you not?  Like, I'm a fucking...  Like, I was lying.  Now, Omar Thornton, you should know.  I can win this argument.  I can win this argument.  Because this fucking thing was...  He's white.  This thing...  No.  Well, maybe.  Omar Thornton shot seven people in the beer factory.  Oh, okay, right, right.  Because he was dealing with racism.  I know the beer factory.  Yeah.  But that shit left in one day.  Because they got bored with it.  Well...  No, the news.  I'm just saying.  They got bored with it.  This is sensationalism motherfucking. 
[00:39:00]  They'll get bored with this in another...  This has...  No, because...  No, this has legs, actually.  This has legs because it's a congresswoman.  It's got a lot of political overtones.  They're blaming...  You know, CNN's blaming Fox News.  Fox News is blaming CNN.  I know Sarah Palin's in there somewhere.  Sarah Palin.  Sarah Palin's...  Her rhetoric might have caused this, some people are saying.  They're saying the nasty right-wing rhetoric and people like Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity  and the like are saying things that are influencing people to go out and shoot these people. 
[00:39:30]  So, this guy, if you read...  I read his shit.  He is a babbling lunatic.  Can we find something where these guys are...  You can...  If you're crazy...  You must have been having one of these guys on it to find something where if you're fucking crazy  that Sean Hannity said something that makes you want to kill somebody.  I like to hear what could be misconstrued with leading people to kill... 
[00:40:00]  I want to hear this shit.  I'd love to know what this fucking Fox News Manchurian Candidate shit is all about.  And this is a tough spot for us because over the years, people have claimed that the type  of radio show we do influences kids.  Yeah, yeah.  It's a member of law.  To do what?  There's a million of these articles out there from the past.  To live a lifestyle that's just, you know...  Yeah, that would...  Sex and drugs and fucking...  Sex, violence.  Violence against women.  Right.  You know, when you talk about Whip Him Out Wednesday or something, it's just promoting 
[00:40:30]  violence against women and sexualizing them and...  So it's tough.  Shut up.  Guys like tits.  Eat me.  Yeah, it's tough for us to say that Sarah Palin's rhetoric caused this because, you know,  we've lived this game for many, many years.  And I would fucking love to.  I would love to go, yep.  I would love to say Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly did it, something like that, but just play something.  Show me one instant.  It's the famous argument about, you know, violent video games.  Is that causing real violence out there?  Yeah.  And a lot of people will say yes, which is completely ridiculous if you just do the numbers and 
[00:41:00]  see how many people are actually playing violent video games.  This guy was afraid of...  And how many incidences out there we've had.  He was afraid of mind control.  Yeah, yeah.  That's what he said.  He was writing shit about mind control and different types of currency.  If you make your own currency, you will have currency.  Then you would have your own currency.  Therefore, your currency would be the currency... 
[00:41:30]  Currency like...  Don't even try to make sense of...  Like electricity or money?  No, money, money.  But you can't...  You're like, he's trying to make these points, but you're reading them and realizing he is  babbling...  Like, you can't even...  You can't make a point out of it.  It's that disjointed, this guy.  Could we get Club Soda Kenny to read his ramblings?  That would be good.  Could we do that?  Yeah.  I think his...  Get some transcripts.  I think his writing should be...  He's fucking crazy.  He's a crazy guy that, for some reason, shot people. 
[00:42:00]  They don't know yet.  He...  You know, they...  But you can't blow it off or just cuckoo nut.  I mean, you gotta...  You can't just go, he's a nut.  No, no, you can't.  No, you gotta...  Something had to influence him.  There had to be a drop of logic there to make something into something.  To go do that.  Maybe he got fucking...  He lived up to this point and hasn't done that yet.  Maybe.  So he did that with a purpose.  Maybe it was his life.  He was rejected doing something. 
[00:42:30]  Maybe he felt that the government was trying to control his mind.  You know...  That's a fair point.  It's crazy shit.  It's fucking crazy shit.  I mean, I mean, don't dismiss him.  No, no.  I mean, don't dismiss it as crazy.  You know, you just can't dismiss that shit as he's a fucking loon.  He's a fucking loon.  I do dismiss him as fucking crazy.  And his own...  Because he did something very not crazy.  He was delivered.  And his fucking psycho mind made him do this.  It's like saying... 
[00:43:00]  It's like saying, oh, okay, well, now I understand.  He saw a Baskin-Robbins sign and thought it was the devil.  It doesn't make it legitimate.  It doesn't make...  No, I'm not trying to legitimize his nonsense.  You can completely just write him off as a lunatic.  I don't like the fact that politically they're trying to turn this guy into this...  Martyr.  Martyr or, you know, a villain that was influenced by one side or the other.  Because it wasn't.  He's a kook.  He's a nut. 
[00:43:30]  You're going to see another one of these.  I'm telling you.  Really?  It's a fucking pattern.  I'm telling you.  Because they just made him a rock star.  Muhammad Ali said a quote I heard recently was amazing.  Back before that.  Oh, okay.  Back before that.  Back before the shakes.  I like your new look, by the way, with the winter hat.  Well, it was a little cold.  And it is shitty cold outside.  It is shitty cold.  My big toe is not having a good time right this second.  It is.  Uh-oh.  You're a big toe all right?  Yeah, yeah, I'm good.  I get a warm, warm thing. 
[00:44:00]  But he just goes, if he worked on a cruise ship...  You know, this is Obama's situation.  He worked on a cruise ship, and he's always been in the kitchen or whatever.  And then one day they told him to come upstairs and start driving the boat.  He'd be like, get the fuck out of here.  Because that means this boat is going to be sinking soon.  And I think somehow, man, Obama just got a hold of a fucking sinking ship.  And I just think the kooks was ready to just be kooky. 
[00:44:30]  And I think his presence in terms of being, you know, the black president and the fact  that white people now have this excuse to now say, he made me be this way.  Right.  And now this shit hits the fan.  And all the crazy white folks are just coming out everywhere, man.  This is a white people situation right now.  But they're using it the other way around.  They're using it to try to promote more of Obama's agenda and the Democrats with this 
[00:45:00]  kooky guy than they are.  A lot of white people exiting.  It's a big exodus of Democrats.  Because Democrats just seem to be the nigger lovers.  And it's like the Republicans are the racists or whatever.  And at this moment, it just seems like there's a lot of white folks leaving the side of change.  They got fed up.  And they got fed up fast.  They got fed up in two years.  A lot of black people did, too, though.  I mean, I've seen a lot of black people that have been totally disillusioned. 
[00:45:30]  They had expectations that went way beyond reality.  Yeah, finally.  Finally.  That's what I said from day one, that in the end, a lot of people are going to be very  disappointed because they're thinking their definition of change is a lot different than  what Obama could possibly do for anyone.  Well, the one woman that said, this is great.  I'm not going to have to worry about my rent and my oil payments and my gas.  She's very disappointed.  You think at this point she is? 
[00:46:00]  But there's also a white guy who bought more guns thinking it was going to be a Negro-opolis.  And he brought a bunch of guns.  And now, you know, he's like, whoa, what happened?  I mean, if you don't understand politics, right, or understand, you know, like I'm into  the old New World of shit, the New World of shit anyway.  So ultimately, it's all the politics part is all just some other horse shit.  People who are just completely believe in the political system and they just go by what 
[00:46:30]  they told, which is a lot of fucking there's a lot of drones.  And it's just like they don't think.  And so, like, when you see, you know, five years ago, six years ago, we was on the radio  before talking about the TSA.  And now five years later, just because a couple of people who believe in politics, they get  fucked over at the airport.  Now it's a story.  Now it's a story, right, right.  So people who've been acting like this guy, I'm not defending him, but he could be screaming 
[00:47:00]  something that makes you dismiss him as a fucking nutbag.  And he just goes out and he just does his thing or whatever.  But he might be saying something that five years later, it's official.  But once once the drone start crying about it, it becomes it's too late.  Yeah.  It's too late.  It's already out of the bag.  So I don't know what he's saying.  I don't either.  And I read it.  I don't want to dismiss this guy from, you know, people say harp.  If you go to that harp, the H-A-A-R-P, that thing that's causing earthquakes, it sounds 
[00:47:30]  It's controlling the weather.  It sounds ridiculous.  Yeah.  But that's the basis of every good sci-fi movie, every good horror movie is that there  was a monster and he really, yeah.  Was it?  There's a creature from the back of the moon, really.  There was a lizard man.  Cloverfield.  There was Cloverfield.  No one ever wants to believe it.  There was a monster that just got it.  Something has got to be real.  At some point, you know? 
[00:48:00]  So I'm just saying, guys like this, when I first learned why bread was bad to eat was  from a crazy, ranting, homeless man in the train station.  He's like, and bread, and I'm listening to this.  What's wrong with bread?  What is he saying?  It soaks up, it's like a sponge that soaks things up in your stomach so that.  All the good shit?  Yeah.  That's supposed to digest?  It's like a sponge that it goes in and then it expands.  That sounds like crazy, man.  It does, but I go. 
[00:48:30]  Well, that's that shitty wonder bread.  That's a sponge.  I love it, too.  Three crazy stories I heard, real quick.  The bread guy from a crazy man.  Two was a woman that explained why people aren't afraid, why this country's not afraid of black  people, and they're afraid of Puerto Ricans and Mexicans, because black people prove that  we will be slaves when it comes down to it.  So shit is the fan.  We will be slaves.  You already have it where you will be slaves because you have been. 
[00:49:00]  We have been.  Oh, okay.  So that's why no one really counts us.  And Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, they've never been slaves.  Right, right.  So it's like, whoa, they're dangerous.  And then the third one was space travel.  Was this guy, I forgot, but it was a guy who said that space people know how to manipulate  the magnetic poles of each planet.  So they know how to.  That's a homeless guy?  A homeless crazy guy.  Dr. Michu cocky in his pants.  And I'm just saying, I remember those things, and these people are supposed to be fucking 
[00:49:30]  crazy.  Yeah.  I'm just saying.  You know?  We should take a break.  I don't know.  That's fucking good.  We're going to try to figure out why the animals are dying.  Someone, they couldn't stick around.  They said, there's pockets of poison all over the fucking place.  All right.  That sounds good.  If a school of fish happens to come upon that little pocket of poison.  Pocket of poison?  Sounds good to me.  I'm just, I don't know.  I'm just, that's conjecture.  I don't know.  Tell me something that's going to make me shut the fuck up.  I don't know.  You just made up some shit, sir? 
[00:50:00]  Or madam?  I would like to get some kind of expert that kind of knows how this shit works.  That just says it.  I'm certainly not going to listen to the stupid media and what they think.  Right.  What else we got?  Football movies.  Pockets of poison.  I just want to say Robert De Niro.  What happened to him?  I'm not sure yet.  What?  I'm just not sure yet.  I don't know.  The black woman pregnant.  All I'm saying is Robert De Niro.  Robert De Niro.  Just in case.  I want.  Just in case.  I want all responsible gun owners to go to the NRA website and read up on all your laws 
[00:50:30]  and see if maybe that's something you want to do to defend your Second Amendment right.  Good luck to you.  They are the people that are there on the other side.  In the very near future.  They'll be erasing that Second Amendment in a couple of days that's on the way out.  I'm just saying.  That'll be gone.  No way.  You don't think so?  Not at all.  Fair enough.  People love their guns.  Yeah, but more importantly, I think.  Take it from my dead cold end.  From my cold dead end.  More importantly, I think Ant needs a new suit for a banquet that's going up. 
[00:51:00]  Oh, you think that's it?  Yeah, that was.  That might be going on.  That was a little plug roller right there.  I'm a lifer now.  I got my lifetime membership.  So you don't have to pay anymore?  No.  Now I pay through contributions.  When I get to, I get some, I got a lot of mail from the NRA.  And it says, hey, you know, we need a couple of bucks.  We're fighting this.  And I read all the legislation.  You know Big Mama's in your mailbox, too.  She's looking in that mailbox.  Yeah, yeah.  She's looking.  She's making, she's seeing what Mr. Kumiya do.  See what I'm doing in there?  Oh, yeah. 
[00:51:30]  Big Mama watches your mailbox, my friend.  She knows what's going on.  I'll write a check and I'll be like, all right, motherfuckers, I am supporting this  because I've read, I don't like the legislation that's trying to be passed.  They got to fight it.  I'm willing to give a few bucks.  I like white people with their rights.  Y'all make me laugh.  I love my rights.  I don't like a few of them.  As soon as you lose it.  We're going to continue with the.  Y'all make me laugh.  I'm going to like a few of them.  We're going to continue with Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  Patrice O'Neal.  Oh, when I said Big Mom, you know what I meant? 
[00:52:00]  The Paul Atoniano.  I should have said Big Sis.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Big Sis.  I thought he was about to.  She's the one.  They call her Big Sis and Big Fugger.  She's always in everyone's shit.  She's peeking around at everyone's shit.  You and your porn guns and young bitches.  Ah, forget about it.  They're just waiting.  All right, we'll be back.  Bro.  No, that didn't work.  Go, hit it.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  O.P. and Anthony.  On the virus.  The serious. 
[00:52:30]  Rich Foss has joined the program.  With Patrice O'Neal.  I miss Rich.  I haven't seen him in a long time.  I haven't done this with Patrice.  We've been arguing the Rich Foss New Year's Eve thing that happened to him.  Yeah.  Well, tell the people out there.  What happened?  Yeah.  You had a gig at Mohegan Sun, right?  I get off stage and Bonnie's going down on the booker in the dressing room. 
[00:53:00]  And I wanted the money, so I'm not going to say, hey, stop.  It might as well have been that.  Huh?  No, that would have been exciting.  You were booked at a casino.  Yeah, I was booked.  And they told you at the last minute that you're going to have to stay up the street.  Because they need a room because New Year's Eve is a very hot night.  And we all know.  We understand that part of that.  It was already sold out.  Right.  I already sold out.  So you said, okay, and you took a shitty room up the street instead of having a nice  room in the casino. 
[00:53:30]  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  The room wasn't shitty, but it was up the street.  The shitty part was it was up the street.  That's shitty.  That's shitty.  The room at the casino is shitty.  Yeah.  Up in the room, not in the casino, not me shitty.  At least you're in the casino, and you wake up, and you don't have to put a winter coat  on to get in a fucking cold car to go do your gig.  If it was summer, who cares?  And drive the host.  Right.  You've been in the business way too long to deal with that shit.  I would say, guess what? 
[00:54:00]  You don't give me a room in the casino, I'm out.  At a certain time.  Patrice would do that exact thing.  But you know as a businessman, at certain times you can make certain calls.  At certain times, you can't.  I have a feeling you do this a lot, though.  No.  Thank you, Patrice.  He's nodding.  I feel like you compromise a lot.  Yeah, right.  I do compromise because I have to compromise when you're in my position.  When you have three kids.  Sometimes I say no.  I say fuck off the money.  What's that?  You're a funny guy.  Oh, God, did I kill this weekend.  You were booked at a casino. 
[00:54:30]  If you told them last minute, I'm not doing a gig unless you find me a nice fucking warm  room in the casino, they're going to find you a room.  Here's the difference.  I sold 350 seats out.  At that same casino, Chelsea Handler sold 9,000 tickets.  Well, she's hot.  Really hot.  9,000 in the arena.  She's the face of an entire network.  I know.  She's extremely hot right now, and it doesn't hurt that she's funny.  Yeah, I'm not going to go with the good-looking thing because I don't see the fucking good-looking  thing.  You shouldn't qualify the respect you have for yourself with where you think you are 
[00:55:00]  in the business.  Don't let people fucking, you know, put a label on you, though.  Don't put a label.  Listen.  You didn't need that money Brad was paying you.  Oh, really?  Because I know how much Brad pays.  That money can never change your life on any level.  You got that.  Well, you quit talking like Malcolm X.  That fucking money.  All right, then.  That money.  That money.  All right.  I'll stop talking like Malcolm X that's trying to help you to stop this ridiculous nonsense. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  Patrice knows more than I, obviously.  I'm not in that business.  Brad Axelrod is not paying you enough to not say no to him.  Right.  That's it.  It seems ridiculous that you go, okay, I'll take a room up the street.  No offense.  I like Brad, but he's a one-nighter guy.  You're right.  He's not a relationship that should make you go, look, you should say, fucks, man.  Are you serious?  I'm already taking, I'm taking blows to the gut.  Call the fight, nigga.  It's just like stay home and hug your daughter. 
[00:56:00]  Hug her today.  Stop using her tuition as an, stop using Brad's $2.76 gig and then trying to pimp language  by saying I'm going to pay my daughter's tuition.  Well, first of all.  That's bullshit.  No, it's not bullshit.  Because you know, first of all.  My daughter's out of college, too.  It's a waste of time.  Who are you telling?  Who are you telling?  I didn't go to school.  Look how good things are going for me.  I've changed my opinion on college big time in the last year or two.  It's ridiculous.  With this fucking debt they're giving these kids. 
[00:56:30]  They work for the school.  They're a hundred, easy hundred thousand in debt without a job when they get out.  And then they're working at the local fucking pizza joint.  And the only way they're going to get work is if they know somebody or somebody knows somebody.  It's a crock of shit.  And where the game is now, you need a fucking degree to work for fucking Burger King.  Like, you need something to make you.  They're all in on it.  Everybody needs a job.  They're all in on it.  Do you see, what's the thing, capitalism, a love story?  There's one part I keep bumping into all the time is how pilots get paid jack shit. 
[00:57:00]  They give blood to people that crash in Buffalo.  They had them on the black box talking about not making money.  Yeah.  One bitch made $16,000 a year.  Yeah, I was going to say, they make less than $20,000 a flyer.  Giving blood.  Give those fucking guys $100,000.  And they're flying all day long.  And they have to get a second job just to pay their bills.  Some tired motherfucker got me up 35,000 feet.  Right.  It's insane, man, what they're doing to people.  So the only thing you got left, really, is to stay home and enjoy the shit that's going to be taken from you soon. 
[00:57:30]  You got nice TV.  We're staying.  You got a nice TV at home.  I got a good TV.  I found a place to get firewood.  All right.  That's all I need.  Tons of firewood.  You need a fireplace and a nice TV.  You're set.  And yank your fucking daughters out of college.  We stayed last night.  Can you please not chew and talk at the same time?  We stayed last night.  I know we all do it.  At a hotel. 
[00:58:00]  For some reason, when you do it, it's really fucking disgusting.  Because it's already a problem when his mouth is completely clear.  Yeah.  Thank you, Patrice.  Of debris, nigga.  Just finish.  Stop looking me up and down.  Just fucking.  Just stop it.  Just stop looking me up and down.  I think she you are.  Patrice looks like an old school burglar today.  I know.  I know.  You got some cools in your back pocket?  It's like I'm crossing 110th Street.  I'm in a worse spot than Voss, but I ain't going to take that gig from Brad. 
[00:58:30]  No.  I'm in a worse spot than Voss.  Stick you up, nigga.  I'm robbing a car.  There's banks up the street.  Fuck it.  Three meals a day.  I'll take that.  What were you saying, Rich?  I'm sorry.  We're staying in a hotel.  It's so clear.  Now, sometimes you don't know who to tip and where to tip.  The dude comes to my room.  It's crazy.  He comes to my room, knocks on the door to tell me he's my butler.  Okay?  All right.  You're staying in a nice joint.  Do I tip him for telling me he's my butler? 
[00:59:00]  Yeah, you throw him money, especially if you're going to use him for something.  Well, don't you do that at the end when you're checking out?  No.  Because it's different people.  Here's what it is.  If you want good service, you tip him at the beginning.  If you want shitty service, then you tip him at the end.  But when I'm using a butler, what would he do to do my-  That's just it.  What do you give your butler when you go to fuck him?  Huh?  Right away.  Right away, I peel off $100 the second he walks in the room.  Now, is he blowing you the whole time you're there for $100 tip?  Uh, he knows he's getting more. 
[00:59:30]  Like, because then every time he brings something, you throw him a little more extra.  Well, you gave a-  It's $100 just to walk in the door.  Just out to-  Just to be like, hi.  Well, because you're a high roller.  But that's casino stuff, though.  What's that?  That's casino stuff.  That's the casino guy.  Isn't that what he's talking about?  No.  No.  I think in New York-  I think Rich is just talking basic shit.  What butler-  I've never been to a hotel in New York with a butler.  Well, you haven't been to the one we're staying at.  Oh, shit.  Huh?  No, no.  This hotel-  Why do you have such a nice hotel? 
[01:00:00]  We usually are on the cheap.  We did a benefit.  And they set you up with a nice hotel?  Not only that, we did a portrait.  Which, Bonnie, it's like a $6,000 package.  You could do this portrait in the studio downstairs.  And, you know, and me, Bonnie, and the baby are doing this portrait.  And it's something we would never do.  You know, then they want to come to your house and look at what wall to put it on and what  colors and all that.  What are you doing?  Look, it's just-  What's going on?  Wait, was it a painting? 
[01:00:30]  I don't even know what the fuck is going on.  How are you following this?  They're painting.  I got it.  Hold on, hold on.  They're painting.  Can you explain to me?  I got it.  He's at a really nice hotel because he did a benefit.  And part of the package is they do a portrait.  So him, Bonnie, and his little girl are getting painted?  No, they take the picture and they paint over it.  And they make it look like a painting.  Yeah, like a painting.  Oh, it's a fucking-  It's a product?  You got to see this thing.  And then you're going to hang it in your house somewhere?  Yeah, but they want to come to your house.  What they do is they take- 
[01:01:00]  It's tracing paper.  No, they take the picture.  Yeah.  And then they digitally fucking Photoshop it to look like a painting.  No, no.  You got to shoot it.  And it's done in two seconds.  And then they pull it out of a giant printer.  Listen, in your fucking Guido Villa at home on Long Island, that's what you might have.  Guido Villa.  I would have to say, I would have to say, spectacular home.  There's only one Guido thing in his house.  But the statue without the arms?  No.  That's pretty- 
[01:01:30]  I like that because I feel it might be real.  If it had arms and it was peeing, that would bother him.  Fucking nice.  You have a black, shiny table in there that I would get rid of.  A black, shiny table.  Like a from Micah.  Really?  Where is that?  In the dining room when you walk into the right.  It's like a-  He doesn't even know what he has in this house.  It's from Micah.  Shiny.  Oh, the one in the dining room.  Yeah.  You probably never see it.  In the dining room?  Yes. 
[01:02:00]  Is that from Micah?  Wait, wait.  Is it right when you walk in the front room?  To the right.  To the right.  Yeah, that's supposed to be something for, you know, when you're keeping a dining room  for dishes.  What do they call that thing?  Why would they-  I don't have dishes.  It's called fill up the space with stuff.  How many times a year does Danny make you dinner?  That you need dishes.  Danny makes a good fucking beer can chicken.  Wait, you got the fancy plates?  No.  In a wall unit?  It's that thing that goes in there. 
[01:02:30]  Fuck that china shit.  And you put the fucking china in it.  It's called a hutch.  A hutch with the china?  I was looking for everything I could to hate about your house.  I was so jealous, but it's just a nice, it's very nice.  Yeah, I love it.  It's one of those things where it's like, ah.  You have nobody-  I'm going to start coming over.  You should.  Come on over.  There you go.  You have property value.  Rich.  Why was the portrait-  I was racist, Roseman.  Yeah, but solely.  Rich, why was the portrait part of the package?  I still don't get that part of it.  Because they don't pay you, so they have somebody digitally put you on a piece of paper. 
[01:03:00]  That was the thing.  When you spent a friend's portrait, five to ten-  Why would you do that?  No one needs a portrait of that.  I know.  And no one buys that portrait.  Who buys that except for fucking-  Rick people that have, like, big holes.  The Slippingtons.  Yeah, you're right.  Fucking-  I know.  No one buys those.  Why are you-  You and his fucking white trans-Canadian wife?  You're being shady.  Why are you-  Why are you part of this package deal?  Well, we did the benefit in Miami for the blind.  We did the benefit at the Rich Carlton down there. 
[01:03:30]  Right.  Should have gone up for the deaf.  I did-  He's on fire now.  Oh, Monday morning.  He got some rest this weekend.  So, what did you do?  Kind of funny, Rich.  We did the benefit, I don't know, a couple weeks ago.  And then, you know, we bid on the, you know, the state of the Regis and stuff.  And, you know, we-  You're up to some shady shit.  What's going on?  Yeah.  I don't even know what's going on.  I know.  I don't know what's going on.  Rich is always wheeling and dealing. 
[01:04:00]  You're wheeling and dealing.  He has to stop.  Listen.  Something's going on.  Rich, if you don't make it, it's discouraging to me.  Like, I need Rich to make it to let me know that I can.  That there's a chance.  I don't want to see this 57-year-old man still trying to be, like, relevant the same  way he was 20 years ago.  He comes in with these hats and he comes in dressed like he's getting ready to punch raw  meat, like he's training for something.  And he's just, he makes me sick with this, with this scamming, I can't not do a Brad 
[01:04:30]  Axelrod attitude.  Like, hey, you don't know what it's like.  I do know what the fuck it's like.  No, you don't.  What are you talking about?  You got it easy, man.  Why?  Why?  You have a beautiful girl.  You don't have responsibilities.  She's working, right?  Is your girlfriend working?  Yeah.  All right.  Mine isn't.  She's working on a movie.  Why isn't fucking Bonnie working?  Because she's working on a movie, editing nonstop.  And Rich, why aren't you saying your wife's beautiful?  She's very beautiful. 
[01:05:00]  Well, you said Patrice has a beautiful woman.  Yeah, but you have a beautiful woman.  Yeah, Bonnie's gorgeous.  And Bonnie can make money anytime she wants.  She has more credits than Rich.  She does.  Like, better credits.  She has a fucking special on HBO.  You don't have V1.  What do you mean?  HBO's V special.  Right now.  In your opinion.  Right now, an hour.  Comedy Central specials are the specials.  They hand those out.  My mailman has a special.  Specials aren't special anymore.  Yes, they are.  If it's on HBO, it is.  That's his point.  On Comedy Central, they hand that shit out. 
[01:05:30]  I did HBO.  I did it way before any of you guys.  Yeah, you did it.  The first white guy.  But it was a seven-second spot.  Bonnie did a special.  She has more credits.  All right.  So why don't you fucking stay home?  I would love to.  And work and edit and let her work.  She can make more money.  She's probably famous in Canada.  Let her fucking go there for three months and goddamn work.  Bonnie isn't famous on her farm, okay?  I can see what he did.  He fucking cannot stand.  It's funny, though. 
[01:06:00]  And I probably would do the same thing.  If my girl was a comic and had better credentials, I would probably try to poison her mind and  think she should quit.  What are you kidding me?  I would fill her full of hot, I'm not going to go over my credit, hot career, and then  love juice, plug her full of hot lead, walk around with a kid, get tired, and then fucking  take Brad Axelrod fucking meetings to...  I get what he did.  I get what he did.  If you see what she's doing with this movie...  And convince her that $5,000 shitty paintings are fucking something. 
[01:06:30]  It's great.  You think that we're hanging that up?  Yes, you are, Rick.  I guarantee we don't hang it up.  I'm going to tell you why you're not going to hang it up.  Huh?  Because you told him the story.  When we get a bigger, nicer place, you don't hang it up in a townhouse.  How are you going to get a bigger, nicer place?  What's the plan?  What's the plan?  We're making a movie right now that I got $33,000 into already.  Okay?  That's the plan.  All right?  You really shouldn't spread...  You shouldn't say that you got $33,000.  You're right.  It's about $35,000.  You should just say, I got a movie in the works. 
[01:07:00]  I'm going to take all energy I have.  And you don't need a portrait to help Rich.  Yeah?  Anything I have, I'm helping Rich.  Fuck it.  You don't even call me back.  What are you talking about?  Because I don't want to be sadder than I am.  I'm happy.  I'm going to play golf in a couple weeks.  Oh, will you stop with the fucking life is a...  Stop trying to see the best in life.  You're not a glasses half full, guys, asshole.  I've known you for years.  I am not.  Stop trying to make deals with God because you see it all falling to pieces.  Listen, I have my health, I think. 
[01:07:30]  I haven't had an MRI in a while.  I think.  That sounds good, actually.  That's a great way to go through life.  I'm with you.  What else are you going to do?  I think I'm healthy.  You know, you know this business.  There's ups, there's downs, there's good times.  You know the deal.  There was a time me and Patrice were walking down the street, and I looked at him.  I go, I have not absolutely anything going on in my career.  And he says, me too.  Do you remember how?  And then two years later, we're both doing great.  Now, okay, things have fallen a little.  They go up and down. 
[01:08:00]  And you know, it's a stock market.  Listen, our careers aren't parallel.  I'm just trying to make you feel better.  No, they're not.  Throw you two in the same boat.  Voss is on drugs.  You see his eyes?  Voss is on fucking methamphetamines.  Voss has a drug problem, and that's why he's fucking working so fucking hard.  If I had a drug problem, do you really think I'd be wearing this?  That's your last thing you're going to sell.  Really?  No, that's the last thing I'm going to sell.  He's pointing to his ass.  His fucking ass. 
[01:08:30]  Fucking rich.  Fucking rich.  I don't know.  He's up to some shady shit.  He's up to something.  Voss is up to something.  I've known him long enough to know he loves to wheel and deal.  He's like Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco.  Oh, Donnie Brasco.  He's just up to something all the time.  He's the king of bartering.  He knows how to barter this motherfucker.  God, he's up to something. 
[01:09:00]  You trade services for all sorts of weird shit.  It's fun, man.  A portrait, though.  I know.  Listen, we wanted just the room.  We didn't want the portrait.  That has to look so gaudy.  Oh, just this.  Maybe a nice picture of the family.  I understand that.  But when it gets to a portrait.  He probably picks a bad frame.  A classless frame.  They want to come sell me a frame.  I can get a frame on Craigslist, man.  They're going to come.  They want to sell me the frame.  That's going to be $1,000.  What are you kidding me?  Nice frame, huh?  I get frames everywhere, man. 
[01:09:30]  You go to a garage sale, get a frame.  You're getting a $1,000 frame.  Did you hear what he said?  What?  Did you hear what he just said?  Get one of the garage sale.  You can go to a garage sale.  Yeah.  Get a frame.  It's the point.  I don't even know how to go to a garage sale.  And you know what?  It does, though.  It's too late.  Obviously not by what you're wearing.  It doesn't matter what I'm wearing right here.  No, we're on radio.  It's too late for him to change, too.  Like, if somebody cuffed him, like, you know, if somebody just said, fuck it, I'm here.  And one of these guys, like, you know, like Louie or Colin says, fuck it, I'm cuffing Rich. 
[01:10:00]  They won't be able to uplift him.  Like, Rich is what he is, man.  He's just, there's no helping.  He's not going to take class pointers.  Like, he's not going to do it.  It's the proverbial old dog.  He's going to go to a fucking garage sale.  He's going to buy that shitty BMW that he tried to pass off as sexy.  And I'm just like, this shit is, he said, he said Porsche.  Now explain the Porsche you got.  Well, I got a Porsche Boxster. 
[01:10:30]  What are you talking about?  What a year.  Well, I bought it two.  It was two years old when I bought it.  You know what he has?  What kind of Porsche he has?  I mean, this is my nickname.  I love Ross.  Yeah.  He has the highest level Toyota Porsche.  So it's the lowest level Porsche.  The lowest level Porsche.  Or the highest level Toyota.  Right.  That's the same car.  Get the highest level Toyota.  Right.  Why are you getting this shitty Porsche?  Are you crazy?  That you can't even drive your friends in.  It's a selfish car.  That's why I got it. 
[01:11:00]  You're not a fan of the selfish car.  It's a selfish car.  I got a truck.  If you in trouble, man, Patrice, come get us.  Right.  Me and my whole family are stuck.  Right.  Voss, come help.  I can't.  We have an SUV, too?  My shitty selfish car won't fit all of you.  You have a selfish SUV, man.  I know what kind of car you got, man.  I got an SUV.  It's selfish.  I love the concept of the selfish car.  I love it, man.  It's just a car that's not, he's not, he don't have any friends.  You don't think if I got tons of money, I wouldn't go out and blow it and buy shit? 
[01:11:30]  Of course I would.  What little money I do get, I go out and buy dumb shit.  I would get, if I had money, I'd get the nicer Porsche.  Okay?  But you know what?  I could only have gotten that one at the time.  Okay?  Voss likes having things.  Yeah, damn.  You're right.  We all like having things, but you like having things.  Yeah.  It's just fun.  You go a little too far with having things.  I know.  I got, like, he knows, he's bullshit.  You could go buy a pair of sneakers and that fills the emptiness right here. 
[01:12:00]  Okay?  He goes out and buys shit because he's lonely and depressed.  All right?  All right?  These sneakers, I didn't need them, but they're pro-keds.  They're, you know, and it was 29 bucks on some website.  And when I bought them.  It's always from a website.  You got to go to this new website.  It's called, everything's on sale, like high-end shit.  It's always a website.  So you buy something, you feel good for a few moments, and then you realize.  Let me see your pro-keds.  These are, they're leather.  These ones are leather.  Who gives a fuck?  Who gives a fuck? 
[01:12:30]  Yes.  I did at the moment when I bought them.  I understand that.  Okay?  I got, you know, you might have a set of golf clubs.  I have three because I like to sit online and buy shit.  That's what I do.  Buying shit is fun.  It's fun.  And then when it comes to your house, you're all like, oh.  Yeah, you know you got a package coming.  Yeah, yeah.  Open that thing up and you're like, ooh.  You've never been to Rich Ross's house.  He's got weird shit in his house.  I've heard his house is like a museum.  And I think you like those old furniture and shit.  So is my act.  Rich, do you watch the home shopping shows on TV? 
[01:13:00]  Does that get you off a little bit?  What do you mean?  The ones where they fix stuff up?  No, like they're selling.  No, not that shit.  That's bullshit.  That's all fake.  No, you're not that far in.  No, I wouldn't buy that shit.  I just like going online and, you know, like what the fuck?  You know, I got on my credit card, I have enough points to get something.  I just don't know what I'm going to get, when I'm going to get it.  But I know I'm getting something.  I don't even know how many points I got.  I do.  I know how many I got.  I'm going on 26,000 points.  And that's a new putter.  I don't need a new putter. 
[01:13:30]  How do we find out how many points we got?  26,000.  I'll find out right now.  How many points you have?  How do you do it?  I have like half a million points on each card.  How do you do it?  I'll do it right now.  I know you've got to go to your –  Yeah, you've got to go to your Amex online thing.  I don't know how to do that.  Well, you've got that kind of money.  I've had a American Express card for – what does it say?  Remember since 01.  All right, so 10 years?  I've never used any points.  I don't know if they had points back then, did they?  You probably got a lot of points.  No clue.  I don't even know where you look for the points.  Do you ever use that thing? 
[01:14:00]  You have the cleanest –  Asshole.  It looks like it hasn't been through one machine.  Asshole.  They give you a new one every once in a while.  This one just came in.  Oh, it did?  Yes, I fucking used my credit card.  Did that hurt you opening your wallet just now?  Wow, a joke from seven years ago.  It doesn't matter.  It's a callback.  All right, man.  I spend a little more now.  Are you a frugal gentleman?  Not as bad as it used to be.  Yeah, certainly.  I've been caught being pretty frugal over the years.  Caught?  Caught being frugal over the years. 
[01:14:30]  Not his wedding, though.  Yeah, there you go.  That was some real –  You're banned at your wedding costs more than my house.  You really did have a fucking Ben Stiller movie wedding party.  It was unbelievable.  His cocktail party was just ridiculous.  I thought that was the whole wedding.  Well, that was – it was all fun until we got dropped from all those markets as I was planning that,  and then I had to go to the wedding planner and say, slow the fuck down.  It got scary.  Wedding planner?  We had Bonnie's aunt. 
[01:15:00]  Put us in a hotel with a buffalo.  Always.  I feel so bad for my friend, Rich.  I just feel bad.  I'm smiling, man.  I feel bad for all of us.  It's a fake smile, Rich.  We all know that.  I feel bad for our whole crew.  The whole crew?  The whole crew.  The whole bunch, yeah?  A whole bunch.  A whole bunch.  Why don't we break and get into some shit?  Let's take a long break.  You watch football over the weekend, Rich?  Some of it.  Yeah, a little.  You see any movies lately?  Yeah.  We'll do some movies, and we'll do some sports now. 
[01:15:30]  I'll tell you my best movie.  I love to tweet on that.  What?  No, after the break, you'll tell us your favorite movie.  Okay, but I can tease.  This is called a teaser.  All right, what is the teaser?  Fucking Winner's Bone.  You just gave away the movie.  That's not a tease.  I was going to tell him how good it was.  And then he says, I'm kidding.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  Opie and Anthony.  On the virus.  On the virus.  Series XM.  An hour. 
[01:16:00]  I'm talking to him.  Patrice O'Neill, Rich Voss.  Where's Rich going to be?  Because Patrice has retired officially.  He's so lucky.  But Rich is still on the road.  Where are you going to be, Rich?  This weekend, catch a rising star?  Yeah, Providence.  Providence, Rhode Island, all right?  And then next week, yeah, in Harrisburg at the Comedy Zone.  The Comedy Zone.  Comedy Zone.  You guys watch the football?  Well, I enjoy it.  Patrice is a big Pats fan, right?  Yes.  I am a Patriots fan.  My Jets squeaked one out.  They certainly did.  They certainly did. 
[01:16:30]  I would love to be an uber Jets fan here.  But I'm certainly worried, obviously, going up to Foxborough.  They're going to lose to the great Patriots.  And Tom Brady's fabulousness.  And they're going to fucking beat the Jets.  I mean, I don't want to argue with you about it.  Not you, but the Jets fans.  It's just going to happen.  I'm a little worried.  We'll see what happens.  They're just better.  Bill Belichick's just better than Rex Ryan.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  He's an asshole.  I don't mean somewhere. 
[01:17:00]  Belichick's just an asshole.  And I think assholes.  I think half his team hates him, too.  Well, one of the guys said, they asked him a question like, so how do you feel about,  you know, this player?  He goes, I don't know.  He said, Belichick didn't tell me what to feel yet for these days.  Yeah.  That's just like, that's how he got it.  Do you guys bet on, you don't bet at all on the game?  I mean.  I probably should.  I enjoy a little sports bet every once in a while, but I haven't done it in so many years. 
[01:17:30]  Have you put on a Jets shirt on Sunday?  No, no, no.  Are you one of those kind of guys?  If you want me to say yes so you can beat me up, fine.  No, no.  I'm not trying.  I'm not about that.  I've never been like Jersey guy.  Yeah.  Never.  Patriots have been dropping 45 points already.  I understand that.  What are they going to do?  And Sanchez has a shoulder that might be a little fucking sore right now.  These amazing little white guys.  The Patriots have found a way to go back to the early 30s of football.  Old school.  Strap it on leather helmets. 
[01:18:00]  Five foot, ten inch.  They all look like.  White boys who fucking run.  And they got one of the Jets throwaways is on that team.  And he's a fucking animal.  Yeah.  They have a guy that they got rid of before they got Randy Moss.  And he's back to like he's a number one receiver.  And they got these two little white slot receivers.  And they got two young tight ends.  And Brady just finds them.  And they catch the ball.  So, that's it.  I guess that's all you need. 
[01:18:30]  They are so basic.  It's despicably basic.  And the Saints are out already.  They lose to the 7-9 Seahawks.  How are you allowed to be in the playoffs when you're a sub-500 team?  I don't get that.  That's the motherfucking rules.  And this guy, Marshawn Lynch.  Right.  Had the greatest run I've ever seen in a playoff game.  I've never seen a run like that.  The 67-yarder, was it?  That was brutal.  I've never even seen no shit like that.  I'm telling you.  The stiff arm he gave that guy, he threw him into the end zone. 
[01:19:00]  He threw that guy away.  It was un-fucking-believable.  But, hey, the Saints had their run.  This is the thing.  People, and I'd say this to Patriots fans.  Don't forget you stunk.  How bad the Patriots stunk for their entire.  I mean, we had John Hanna, who was one of the baddest motherfuckers that ever played.  He never won a fucking thing.  But he's a beast.  And Steve Grogan, it was some great. 
[01:19:30]  Mosey Tutupu.  Some great players.  But the Patriots stunk.  Went to a Super Bowl in 85 and got destroyed by the greatest football team I've ever seen in my lifetime.  Which was the Bears.  The Bears.  The fucking 85 Bears.  Yeah.  Was the greatest football team I've ever seen in my life.  No one's better.  You don't know this, Rich.  85 is a big year for the Bears.  Holy shit.  The Super Bowl shuffle.  That came out of your mind, right? 
[01:20:00]  They were so good.  You forget that they were.  With the fridge.  With the fridge.  25 years later.  And then they.  You do know.  You lost a lot of money on that game.  I don't remember.  We went to a Super Bowl in 96 when Tuna.  And God bless Tuna.  Because I think that's when the Patriots started becoming.  Becoming.  Something.  A something.  Because he said, first of all, let's get rid of this stupid little man.  I had the little man on the helmet.  It was so stupid.  And then he put the little sleek thing.  And they went to the Super Bowl in 96.  Lost to the Green Bay Packers. 
[01:20:30]  And then.  And then somehow.  And then the next year he was gone.  He was.  That was the year he was negotiating as.  As he's getting ready for the Super Bowl.  Right.  His next contract with.  Well, because he didn't want.  He said he only wanted to.  That's when he said, I don't want to.  If you're going to let me run the store.  You should let me buy the groceries.  Whatever the fuck.  Cook the meal and buy the groceries.  But he was pissed off going into a Super Bowl.  Which certainly didn't help.  Yeah.  Because he's thinking about.  The morale of the team.  He doesn't.  He wanted to run the show.  He was tired of these.  But how about you win the Super Bowl? 
[01:21:00]  Because that's pretty impressive.  And then worry about that shit.  He's not here to win Super Bowls.  He won his two.  He's here to fix funky shit.  That's what he wanted.  That's what he was there to do for Dallas.  Right.  What he was there for.  For the Jets.  Right.  And what he's there for for Miami now.  And he's going to leave them.  He's there to make you not suck.  And then scram.  Who are you talking about?  Bill Parcell.  Yeah, but if you're.  Whatever.  It's old news.  You know what?  The fucking Patriots.  They really played fucking these people in Connecticut.  When they said, yeah, maybe we'll move down to Connecticut.  Just so they can do a power move.  And get their new fucking stadium.  And everybody in Connecticut is all happy. 
[01:21:30]  They think they're getting a real team.  Since the Whalers left.  That's all I know in sports.  That's terrific, Rich.  Did you.  That was pretty good.  If Patrice would have said that, you would have agreed.  You would have said.  You would have said that.  I wouldn't have said that, actually, though.  Yeah, I don't think.  And then it sounds like this is fucking high school teasing.  You don't know shit.  I know a lot.  Here we go.  Let's talk about golf.  Like.  Golf.  Let's talk about golf.  And please don't make fun of my speech.  You don't have the right. 
[01:22:00]  You haven't earned any right.  Well, you don't have the right to smile.  Nothing.  What the fuck?  I got nicer teeth.  What did he do to you?  Don't fucking.  You know what?  You know what?  Just watch the problem with you fucking guys.  You'll take anybody's side against me.  Okay?  Never.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.  No.  Voss, before you become a victim.  I'm a Jew.  I've always been a victim.  You felt.  You kind of make it easier.  You felt left out of this conversation.  I do.  I understand.  Anthony does, too, because he's not really interested. 
[01:22:30]  No.  But guess what he did?  He's just going to wait until he has something to add.  Well, you know what you added?  Nothing.  You and Opie were talking about.  Maybe I was doing.  But there's some people that know football that go, oh, shit.  It's football time.  Let me listen.  I know baseball.  This is football time for some people out there, right?  Then you go, fuck, can you say some ridiculous Connecticut thing?  Yeah.  To just try to blow a hole in the shit so you can get back in.  Yes.  Oh, okay.  Listen. 
[01:23:00]  You're not a victim.  Give us five more minutes and we'll go back to garage sales or something.  We'll talk about the Antique Roadshow for you.  You fucking old fuck.  He turned us into poor Voss.  We are.  And I don't know.  But here's what, you know.  And I don't even know.  He hasn't got enough airtime.  Motherfuckers like Voss.  He's with butter.  No, I don't care about airtime.  Here's what bugs me about Voss.  There's people in my life who just, they have no, like, just small worldliness about everything.  Like, a little bit of knowledge about everything. 
[01:23:30]  And if you don't have that knowledge, you say, you ask some questions to make it.  Rich, ask a question.  Huh?  Like that you're interested in things you don't know.  Right.  Ask a question, Rich.  Instead of destroying shit.  Ask a question.  About what?  What do you want me to ask?  Sports in general.  And trust me, I don't know shit.  I'll be the first to tell you.  I don't even know much.  I don't even know much.  Who cares?  I never knew about hockey.  Right?  I never knew about hockey.  And it's ridiculous.  And then you ask a question to make it make sense.  Oh, okay.  Because why would you go through life and do something as important as football, right? 
[01:24:00]  That's important.  I know a little bit about golf.  Enough that if somebody who knows a lot, I go, hey man, that's very...  What's the FedEx Cup?  That's a dumb question.  That's a trivia.  That's a trivia.  That's the biggest thing in golf right now.  That's the biggest thing in golf.  That's the Lay's potato chip bowl in football.  Like, that's a stupid question.  That's Notre Dame and Auburn.  No, no.  You're just scared the shit out of me.  The basics of golf.  I don't play it, but the basics, I can fucking... 
[01:24:30]  I can go, okay.  I get it.  Yeah, it's like saying, like, what's a birdie they're talking about?  Yeah, a birdie.  I know that.  Like, yeah, he knows that.  But that's a question, like, somebody that doesn't know would ask.  Well, stop, stop, stop.  Patrice is right that I just jumped in with just to get in.  Okay?  He's right about that.  But what I did say is...  Thanks for the validation.  No, no, no.  Calm down.  It is a known fact.  Don't fucking tell me.  No, we're talking...  No, you know what?  This is where you're wrong.  You were talking about what a fuck, what Belichick is. 
[01:25:00]  But I was saying how the organization fucked Connecticut.  So that was relevant to the conversation.  I will.  I will have to defend, Rich, on this point, unfortunately.  See, I am coming to your side.  Okay, thank you.  Because the FedEx is a big deal now in golf.  Okay.  No, let's get back to...  It's not like one tournament.  What's the fucking...  What's the...  What's the Masters?  Like, if that's...  For a person who don't know golf, it's a silly question.  It's arbitrary.  I'm talking about the game of golf that everyone plays and not just... 
[01:25:30]  So what do you want to ask me?  There are rules.  But the Masters is a big question, too, because there's only four majors.  So that's kind of a big deal, too.  That's trivia for...  We're not talking trivia.  We're talking about basic...  Yeah, like, hey, what happens if your ball lands on the cart path?  Just basic interest.  Huh?  Basic interest.  What happens if your ball is on the cart path?  What do you do?  You move it to point of entry, then closer to the hole.  Oh, no.  And you don't lose a stroke?  If you're Rich Vosch, you kick it forward 50 yards.  Are you really...  And make believe that's where your ball was the whole fucking time.  Really?  You've ever seen me cheat golf? 
[01:26:00]  You fucking cheater.  Yeah, I'm a cheater.  Please.  I beat you and your father-in-law so bad, you guys drove home in tears.  Oh, shit.  He came close, please.  He wants a rematch, too.  This is some old personal shit.  He wants a rematch.  And now I have to apologize to Rich.  Okay.  This could be vengeance because of what he did to your family.  Really?  People from Philly have a lot of pride for some reason.  He's bragging about, oh, my father-in-law, my father-in-law.  He gave you a good run.  He gave me a good run, really? 
[01:26:30]  He gave you a good run.  You know what?  A lot of second-place teams give the first-place team a good run.  Oh, shit.  We're going to have a rematch in the spring, sir.  Nobody remembers the guy in second place, all right?  The spring held.  Want to talk about lost balls, then?  Huh?  Lost balls?  What about lost balls?  Oh, here it is.  This is.  All right.  I have to say sorry, Rich.  I have to apologize.  We all know Opie to have vengeance in his heart.  Fucking Rich starts around. 
[01:27:00]  He hates Rich from that whooping.  Oh, yeah.  And Rich probably talks shit to the family.  Absolutely.  He dismissed the family.  In all fairness, it's fine.  It was a great day.  And we're going to have a rematch.  But what I want to say about Rich is he'll start a hole with a brand-new shiny golf ball.  And he's putting with something that looks like it has tumors by the end of the fucking hole.  Because he happens to shank one in the woods and find it 20 fucking minutes later.  So he's saying that you shake it in the woods and somehow you found a brand-new shiny ball. 
[01:27:30]  No, no.  He starts with a shiny ball.  That's the key.  And by the time he's putting, the thing can't even roll right because it's been in the woods for 10 years.  I don't hear no words.  Let me explain something to you.  Okay.  In the woods.  And first of all, of course, we played there was no woods because we played a Link-style course.  I'm not even talking about the time you played my father-in-law.  Okay.  When we played Beth Payne.  I'm talking about the time where you broke my fucking hand.  Let me ask you because I'm outside of this.  And made me check you for kicks, you fucking asshole.  But here's what interests me.  I believe you to be a cheater. 
[01:28:00]  No, I'm fine.  I bet you.  No, I guarantee you.  I bet you Voss has cheated in gold.  No, no, no.  How about when you play by yourself?  You've never cheated when you play by yourself.  No, there's no reason.  If I, if I, on a par six, first of all, I said a par six.  A par five?  Is there a par five?  A par five is the biggest you can go?  Yeah.  Some retarded courses have.  There's one that had a par six.  Okay.  So why would you have?  In no tournament, there's no par six.  I'm not talking about tournaments. 
[01:28:30]  I'm talking about regular.  Okay, there's no par six.  A par six is extremely rare and ridiculous.  And it's difficult, right?  I can't imagine somebody of Voss' physical stature not cheating on a par five course.  Why he's by himself.  Because his first hit is only going to be 100 yards, maybe.  But you know what's so funny?  I would love to go with Patrice, but I can't.  Voss, I can't imagine Voss could hit it more than 115 yards.  That first one. 
[01:29:00]  100 what?  115 yards.  He could almost do that with a wedge.  Why?  He's really good?  Voss could hit the fucking ball for his size.  Is Voss really good?  For his size.  Voss is actually a really good golfer.  Here's the thing.  He's a lot of things.  You ever watch these girls play golf?  He doesn't have fun doing it, but he's good at it.  Why?  I quit biting my arm.  These girls, they're this big.  These little Asian girls, they hit the ball 250 yards.  It has nothing to do with size.  It depends what club.  250?  250?  You know.  Yeah, if the wind's at my back.  All right, then you've got the power of a little Chinese girl then. 
[01:29:30]  Damn straight.  Fucking stick.  You suck.  You suck.  Let's get back.  Let's get back to football.  Patrice, did you hear the announcers in the St. Seahawks game?  No.  With the guy with the lisp?  Mm-mm.  You should have told the guys ahead of time to get the fucking audio.  The guy had a lisp.  No.  The entire game.  But if you didn't see it, then this is meaningless.  But a lot of people picked up on it.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Who was he?  He must have been the announcer for Seattle.  I believe he was.  And they gave him the shot at prime time. 
[01:30:00]  And he has a list.  What was his last name?  Vos?  Oh.  A little self-deprecating humor.  That's what I'm trying to say.  I kind of like it.  Did you see the Eagles game?  Yeah, I did.  But I knew.  Vic isn't as good as he thinks.  Let me tell you something, man.  Vic started.  I've noticed that the last few weeks.  I'll tell you what happened to Mike Vic.  Yeah.  He started getting comfortable that white people like him again.  Yeah.  He wanted that dog.  He said he wanted a dog.  And everybody started remembering. 
[01:30:30]  You can.  I told you.  I don't know.  I think I told somebody.  I might have been on this show.  Yeah, I think it was.  It was the interview.  I could see the interview.  It was when he scored.  See, when he first came back, he would score a touchdown and then hand the fucking ball to the ref.  He did, like, good Negro shit.  No fucking dance.  No dancing.  No celebrating.  Here you go.  No fucking talking shit.  And then after that Monday night game, when white people liked him again, you could see the swag come back. 
[01:31:00]  And you could see him start to feel like, yeah, I'm good.  Like, I think I could start doing some black shit and be cool with it.  And he stopped this.  See, why he was jerking him off is because he had.  Here's what they turned him in.  See, what they would rather have in the NFL is Tom.  They don't want a nigger who can run and throw.  They want a white boy who can throw and run. 
[01:31:30]  You feel me?  They want fucking Tom Brady to be able to run.  That's their dream.  So Michael Vick was doing it that way for a second.  He was thinking throw.  Look at how he keeps his feet up.  And how he, oh, my God.  And then he runs if he just has to.  They don't like these scrambling niggas.  They want, they want.  And he became a scrambling nigga again.  Just starting running.  Yeah.  And they don't like it.  They don't.  They do not like it. 
[01:32:00]  And that's what he became again.  He stopped being like this pocket passer that they want to ever get.  Who doesn't like it?  The white world?  Yeah.  Because it's something they can't do.  They love Steve Young.  Steve Young is a Hall of Famer.  Steve Young used to run all the time.  His best highlights are this fucking asshole running.  Yeah.  But it's like the Fran fucking Tarkenton.  Never ran.  That's all he did was scramble.  Yeah, he scrambled.  He was a scrambler. 
[01:32:30]  Whoopsie.  That's why he can't fucking walk.  He was a scramble.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  But as soon as you get fucking Michael Vick or Vince Young and then Donovan McNabb,  this is why they never liked Donovan.  Because then you get these black quarterbacks who can run.  But then the white announcers are like, oh, he's a scrambler.  He gets hurt, busts his knee, and he stopped running.  And it's almost like he enjoyed it so that he can prove that he can be smart like a white quarterback.  Like, if you can run, fucking run. 
[01:33:00]  Not just using brute strength to run.  Look, I'm not just a gorilla.  Throwing trees.  He's, I'm a runner.  I can think.  Like, that's more shit with white people in your head.  Like, use your skills and do the right thing.  But he went back to scrambling and went back to bad mechanics because he was good.  He was getting good.  A perfect weapon will be Tom Brady who can fucking run.  Or Peyton Manning, who's not a statue, and he can just run if shit gets fucked up? 
[01:33:30]  That's some dangerous ass shit.  But Michael Vick won't.  He could throw a fucking football out, Vick.  He's a beast.  He just doesn't have the greatest aim.  He can't, like...  His mechanics are horrible.  Can I ask you a question?  How he throws the fucking football is insane.  But Voss has a question.  Can I ask you?  Yes.  Okay, now, of course, you want a quarterback that can scramble and run, like you said, Tarketon.  Yes.  Okay.  But...  Tarketon.  Like, whatever.  Fran.  Fran.  Tarketon. 
[01:34:00]  Actually, Tarketon.  Whatever it is.  I don't know.  It was back in the day.  Who cares?  It's only a name.  The halfback is the runner.  I'm just laughing at how difficult this show is.  It's just...  It's just...  There's an attack around the corner.  It really is.  It's just...  It's nerve-wracking.  It really is.  Why would anybody want to come on this show as a guest?  I couldn't sleep last night.  It's nerve-wracking.  It really is.  You can't say anything.  There's a mugger around the corner.  I had to take a lot of room to go to bed last night.  Damn.  I'm having fucking anxiety every time.  It's so true. 
[01:34:30]  We all know Voss has a speech impediment.  I know.  That was...  And he says Tarketon, but that's...  Tarketon.  That was close enough for any other radio show in America.  We all speak fluent Voss.  Just let him have Tarketon.  I know.  Tarketon.  Tarketon.  I don't know.  But is this...  What's his question?  Tarketon.  What's your question?  Okay.  Obviously.  You know, it doesn't...  Obviously, you want a quarterback... 
[01:35:00]  Come on, it's not Tarketon.  What's your question?  Tarketon.  Okay.  History.  Obviously, you want a quarterback that can run, do everything.  But basically, it's a team.  This is what you do.  You don't want a guard that could...  A guard is supposed to block for the court.  You know what I'm saying?  Everybody has their...  You know, the end isn't supposed to be able to throw the ball.  He's not supposed to come around and...  What's the fucking question, man?  The main thing a quarterback is supposed to do is run the team, be smart, and be able 
[01:35:30]  to throw the ball.  That's the main thing, right?  Actually, not really.  The quarterback is the most important...  That's what I just said.  Run the team.  But I'm saying, if things break down, okay?  Or if things don't break down, and you have a quarterback that can run like a running  back, fucking what's the difference?  Now, you know who...  I used to play football, so it's like, you block for somebody who's fearless.  Like, you want to block for a motherfucker that you know is going to help you win games. 
[01:36:00]  So, if Michael Vick is running, you know he's a trooper, you're going to block for him.  So, it doesn't...  You can't put that on the guard.  You can't...  Because it...  That's why they go in skilled positions.  Skilled positions are the motherfuckers that improvise.  Me, I'm 6'4", 400 pounds.  I don't fucking improvise.  Now, you drive yourself right into...  I go hutt-hutt, and I block that cocksucker in front of me.  That other 700-pound dude.  And then, the skill positions make sure that...  What position you play?  I played tackle both ways. 
[01:36:30]  I played halfback, man.  There's no way you played halfback.  I played halfback.  I was quick.  I was very quick.  What in the...  Get the fuck out of me.  I'm not bullshod.  I played halfback.  I was quick, man.  You was a running back where?  The 10-year-old league?  What unathletic league was you fucking...  Yes, I'm very athletic.  It was all Jews?  Yeah, it was the...  It was all Jewkish league.  Can you imagine?  The JFL.  Well, everybody's an owner.  There's no players.  Should have won with the KFL. 
[01:37:00]  Oh, man.  22 people on the field negotiating.  Nobody will hit you because you're scared.  They don't want to hit you because you're scared.  But he goes, boo!  I think I went red.  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Did he ever get to his question?  Yeah, he asked it.  Oh, I tapped out a lot.  It was really a statement.  Okay.  You know, but that's...  Did you think the Eagles should have got past the Packers?  Not the way they were playing, though. 
[01:37:30]  And not the way Aaron...  Well, they obviously didn't seem like they were playing a good game.  Aaron Rodgers is a beast.  He's a fucking good quarterback, huh?  He's a beast, but he's not...  He's just not in the talks at this moment because Drew Brees and Peyton Manning and Tom Brady are dominating the quarterback world.  But evidently, Aaron Rodgers is a fucking animal.  He's on his way up.  He's on his way, man.  He can beat you by himself because they have nobody.  They had the best tight end in the league for a second.  He got hurt.  They got a few guys, but they have this kid on defense who's like a goddamn white Lawrence Taylor. 
[01:38:00]  This is where I tap out.  This fucking Clay Matthews.  I don't know any of this.  I don't know any of this.  He's like a fucking animal.  Actually, what?  Yeah.  Clay Matthews is an animal.  Yeah.  So it's like, you know, they got some people.  They got some people, but, you know, I mean, who are they playing?  Atlanta?  They're going to get beat by Atlanta.  Atlanta's a good fucking team.  It's going to be Patriots Atlanta if everybody does what they're supposed to do.  Now that New Orleans is out.  Yeah.  No bullshit.  Sometimes a fluke happens. 
[01:38:30]  You're listening to the fan, folks.  Nothing.  He should have planned that out, though.  I try to, like, look at the paper like it was nothing.  I try to play it off like, you know.  I'm so uncomfortable now.  You just make people uncomfortable, Rich.  Right.  It's just like.  Are you uncomfortable now?  But he'll victimize himself.  He'll victimize himself.  Why are you beating me up?  If Patrice said that, it would be.  If I said.  We're listening to the fan. 
[01:39:00]  And then I had no confidence in it.  I didn't have any.  No belief.  None at all.  He just wants to say something.  Say something.  I thought it would have been funny.  Shut up.  But where were you going?  Nowhere.  Nowhere.  Nowhere.  He had no plan B to make it better.  I always have hope that he's going somewhere when he does that.  I usually do have some.  If Rich builds a building, he'll have one piece of wood and hope that everybody else has the rest of the fucking material.  Why did he need a prop for that bad line?  Because he knew.  He actually had a prop. 
[01:39:30]  And he said no.  No.  It was his fucking confidence.  It was the deuce chills he gave himself.  I thought.  I thought.  And he folded up the paper.  I thought he was cleverly going into a plug for one of his shows.  No.  That was plan B.  You had nothing after that.  That was plan B.  But I was so embarrassed by plan A.  Why are you fucking going against your comp?  You have.  I would say.  We all are basically.  We're fluent in Voss.  Yes.  You know he had nothing else. 
[01:40:00]  You know what cleverness was he getting ready to say?  I hold out for hope with him.  You know the first of all has no second of all.  You're right.  You're right.  You're right.  Maybe I'm tired because it's Monday.  You're right.  I should have picked up on the towel.  But that's because we love Rich.  We want Rich to succeed.  Because it throws everything out of whack.  I need Rich to succeed.  This is my friend.  Listen.  First of all.  We roll together.  Here's the thing.  I hear you.  I agree.  In the overall aspect of life, I'm successful. 
[01:40:30]  Okay.  He's been reading the secret.  I don't read any.  I don't read.  He's been reading some positive horse shit.  I don't read.  You got an iPad now?  I don't read.  You got an iPad?  No, I'm going to buy Bobby's old one.  See, it's always that.  That's what bothers me.  There's always a fucking deal with this.  Why don't you just go get a fucking new iPad?  Because I don't know if I'm going to buy a deal.  Why are you always looking for a deal?  I don't know if I'm going to like it.  You'll like it.  Huh?  Dude, you'll like it.  That's what infuriates me.  When was the last thing you actually bought something brand new and didn't go looking  for a deal?  Get a new wedding present. 
[01:41:00]  Oh, shit.  I don't even know what you got me.  I don't even know what you got me.  Well, it was $300.  Thank you.  I appreciate that.  What?  Why is Bobby getting rid of it?  Because a new one will come out.  Well, why don't you just buy yourself a new one?  What are the specs on Bobby's fucking iPad?  And how much is he going to give it to you for?  I don't know.  Well, listen, I'm good at buying.  You don't.  You never buy yourself nice stuff.  At least I don't buy it.  You're always looking for a fucking deal.  No, here's the thing.  The car is always two years old.  Nice other people's shit. 
[01:41:30]  Right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's always a deal that has to be made.  It's fun.  It's fun.  Why don't you find yourself an iPad?  You're successful.  Huh?  You're successful.  Go out and get a fucking iPad.  Maybe I'll do it today.  Do it.  Somebody else's wrist sweat was on your watch.  No, this is brand new.  This is brand new, brother.  All right, so you did buy yourself a brand new.  All right.  At least, all right.  I don't believe him.  I'll show you the paperwork.  I don't believe him.  You got a dead guy's watch on you?  Not at all.  You did, right?  It's a deal.  No.  Dead guy's watch.  Yeah, it's some deal.  He bought it in Canal Street in the back. 
[01:42:00]  No.  How'd you buy the watch?  I guarantee you have something on the list.  I'll tell you how I bought it.  Just listen for the deal.  There's going to be some kind of bartering that happened.  Did I ever say Martin's Jewelers on this show?  Voss has a diamond.  Let me see.  Which one?  Let me see that.  He has a diamond bezel Rolex.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Voss did not buy a diamond bezel Rolex. 
[01:42:30]  I was making stupid money.  Voss did not buy a diamond bezel.  Listen to me.  You did not buy that retail.  Oh, no, no.  Whoa, whoa.  Stop.  You're right.  You know what?  I bought the Rolex, and then I bought the bezel separate.  I went and got the bezel at the jewelry store.  If we continue to fucking cross-examine his pussy.  You're breaking down her own.  You know what the fuck that's going to be.  Okay.  What happened was-  Explain how you bought the watch.  I guarantee there was some kind of bartering or something.  Not for this one.  So I have to get the watch part first.  My other Rolex.  Here's how we find out.  Go ahead, Patricia.  My other Rolex.  Here's how we find out.  What's the style of Rolex? 
[01:43:00]  This one?  This is the-  What's it called?  The fucking-  Oh, the Datejust.  The Datejust.  And then I went and bought the diamond bezel.  Because I bought Bonnie a diamond bezel.  When Bonnie had the-  They just sold it to me for half price.  When Bonnie had-  Wait, hold on.  When Bonnie had the baby, I bought her a diamond bezel because I bought myself one.  How much you pay for it new?  What, the watch?  Yeah.  I think like seven grand. 
[01:43:30]  There's a whole bunch of them.  It was like seven grand new.  I'm looking at Voss's.  I don't know if you bought it.  I'm telling you.  Not for seven G's.  I don't fucking believe it.  No, I don't believe it.  My other Rolex, there was some shady shit behind it.  Everything you do has shady shit behind it.  Everything.  I don't believe him.  I don't believe it either.  I don't believe him.  I'm square business.  Square business.  What?  That's what niggas say.  When you're dealing in street.  Yo, look at me. 
[01:44:00]  Square business.  Square business.  Just watch.  Square business.  I'm trying to say.  So you actually spent $7,000.  No more because then I went and bought the diamond bezel.  That watch.  Like that.  Nobody would do that.  Voss would not have bought a brand new that watch.  I'm telling you.  No, he could have got it cheaper looking around.  No, no, no.  You can't.  Not just.  You can get a different watch.  This is what I'm saying about Voss.  What?  You're saying this isn't a nice watch? 
[01:44:30]  No, no, no.  No.  That Rolex that Voss has.  Okay.  A particular one.  Because Danny looked it up.  Well, I bought it three years ago.  And there's a whole bunch of different fucking.  You're right.  I bought it.  I've had it three or four years.  No, it's within range of what it would cost.  A brand new Rolex, right?  It's like I said, that Rolex there is the, it's the, you buy a top of the line Toyota.  So this is a top of the line Rolex.  And so this is why he's lying. 
[01:45:00]  Yeah, that's why we're suspicious.  And that's why you're lying.  Because a seven, you're not spending $7,000 on watchers.  There's no $7,000 top of the line Rolex.  You're wrong.  You think you know everything about everything.  I don't.  But a top of the line Rolex is more than $7,000.  First of all, you can get a Rolex for $150,000.  Then don't say you bought a top of the line Rolex.  Right.  I bought a $7,000 Rolex.  So compared to the $4,000 Rolex, it's the top of the line. 
[01:45:30]  He bought, again, he bought that Boxster.  He bought the Boxster.  No, no, no.  He bought the bottom of the line.  And he could have gotten the top of the line Toyota.  You could have got a top of the line.  Guy, he just doesn't shut the fuck up.  You could have got a top of the line.  Well, I was waiting with you there.  You could have got a top of the line.  You could have got a top of the line.  What watch do you have?  What watch?  A, a, a, a, a Breitling.  Is that the top of the line Breitling?  Absolutely not.  Okay.  Is it a nice Breitling?  Yes.  What did that cost you?  $3,000, right?  Yes.  That's about a $3,000.  My other Rolex is a $5,000 Rolex. 
[01:46:00]  This is a $7.  Maybe one day I'll have a $12,000 Rolex.  Because we don't.  But he bought a very good Rolex for cheap.  No, I didn't buy it for cheap.  I bought it for what the, I, not only that, I bought this.  None of us believe you.  See this right here?  See this shit right here?  If it did, it would be the first time you've actually bought something from the diamond store.  You're a diamond star of David.  I bought this shit in the diamond district right here, right?  That's where you get deals and shit.  You know the deal in the diamond district.  This I bought from a jewelry store. 
[01:46:30]  So it wasn't, there's no bartering.  There's no, I mean, maybe a little, hey, do this, do that.  You know, take a couple.  But this was, I think, a $9,000 watch.  And they gave it to me for seven because I might have plugged them on radio.  I don't know, somewhere I might have put their name on something.  Who knows?  But that's what we're getting at.  There's always something going on with that.  So that was the deal?  No, but I didn't do it this one.  I think it goes deeper than that, but at least he's admitting that much.  And he'll admit more.  Yeah, he didn't just walk in and go, no, I want that, take $100 off and boom, I'll walk out of the store with it now. 
[01:47:00]  No, there was something else going on, but you already admitted.  Listen, you pay full price for everything.  Who's going to walk in and pay for it?  Not everything, but a lot of times I do.  And even when I wasn't making money, because sometimes it's like, I want that.  I'm getting it now.  I'm not going to go on the internet and look for a bargain.  You always are looking for a bargain.  I wouldn't buy a bargain.  It's not the bargain.  It's the fun of a negotiating, man.  It's not the bargain.  I pay full price for almost everything. 
[01:47:30]  Really?  Yeah, I was like, oh, that?  Is that what it costs?  All right, I'll take it.  Yeah, that was too much work.  Huh?  That was too much work, and I'm talking about before I had money.  What is this fucking Saigon?  Well, first of all, you can't barter for certain things that you buy.  You know what I mean?  True.  Okay.  Do you walk down Canal Street ever?  Never been.  What's on Canal Street?  All right.  No, I don't go to Canal Street.  No.  It's the drug addict mentality.  You don't get it, but you like to negotiate or you like to fucking. 
[01:48:00]  No, it's a pain in the ass.  It's not a pain in the ass.  You're worth millions of dollars.  That's not the point we're making.  He vows protestive too much.  It's not the point we're making, Rich.  What we're going back to, he's actually making that point, is that he got it on a deal.  Yeah.  Yeah, but it wasn't brand new out the fuck.  I'm going to tell you why.  It was brand new.  It was brand new.  Rolex dealers can't, they can't fuck with a price. 
[01:48:30]  They don't fuck around.  You can't fuck with a brand new Rolex price.  He yells, so he's got to be right.  They don't need to do that.  When he yells, he's got to be right.  You're 100% wrong.  I'll shut up.  It could be the last year model.  They don't, because Rolex holds their price forever.  So you buy it for $20, you sell it for $20.  That's not true.  They don't hold their price.  He already admitted he got $2,000.  They do hold their price.  No, they don't.  Go online.  I got the GMT or whatever Rolex that is.  All right?  Here's another thing.  What?  Lookit, I know that I have the Breitling Avenger. 
[01:49:00]  Okay?  Why I know that?  Because I brought a $3,000 watch, and I'm like, what the fuck is this?  He bought a $7,000, I think, of a Scootily Doodily Scootily.  It's like, will you stop it?  Just fucking stop it.  Have you ran out of things you're saying, where you're going to attack my watch?  No.  Now this is more diverse than every tactic.  Is there an extra letter on that watch? 
[01:49:30]  There's an S.  It's a Rolexes.  Thank you.  Forget it.  Is there an extra letter?  Now we're doing stock.  It's a Rolex.  Is that a stock?  All right.  Oh, my God.  I like that.  Oh, Jesus.  You don't come to my watch.  But at least you admitted that you got $2,000 off the watch.  I don't know.  By doing some Hootily Doodily stuff.  All I'm saying is that's fine.  That's your thing.  You'd like to bargain and go online and find deals.  I get that part of it.  Hold on. 
[01:50:00]  But you do that with everything.  And that's the problem we have.  Go and buy an iPad.  They're not that expensive.  First of all, you have a lot more problems, and it's authority.  But my spending habits aren't a problem to you.  Okay, I...  Excuse me.  Oh, God.  Holy shit.  Yeah, but your lung cancer certainly is a problem.  I hope it's not contagious.  What the fuck was coming out of you?  I got some of Anthony's hair in my mouth.  Okay, here's the thing.  I love...  I spend money.  I'm not...  I'm far from cheap. 
[01:50:30]  Okay, last night we went out for dinner and just dropped $150 for nothing for the kids.  What was the deal you made with the fucking restaurant?  No, no.  We went out...  When you say that, that's a gentleman's price.  That ain't shit.  $150?  Without alcohol?  How many people?  Three.  Seven.  No, me, Steve, Bonnie, and the baby.  But we were going to just go get some light sandwiches.  We're going to a nice place tonight.  If it was McDonald's, then we'd be impressed.  What kind of restaurant?  You can't get out of a restaurant for less than $150 for people.  And I love the free breadsticks.  Okay.  The Olive Garden. 
[01:51:00]  Where'd you go?  Voss, where'd you go?  I don't know.  The fucking concierge sent us somewhere.  What the fuck?  You know, I have a concierge.  What type of food?  He doesn't know.  The concierge.  He doesn't know.  It was Italian.  Can we agree that we will not allow him to say he doesn't know any of these things anymore?  Like, where'd you go to eat?  I don't know.  What's the watch?  You know?  I don't know.  Like, what's going on?  What's the name of the fucking restaurant?  The fucking Italian restaurant down the street from the hotel.  Who the fuck?  Who cares the name? 
[01:51:30]  It was good.  It was good.  Anyhow, what I'm trying to say, let's get back to my point.  Lookit.  Let's get back to my point.  Hold on.  Here's my point.  We're done with your point.  You know I'm not cheap.  Voss always talks like he's trying to talk his way out of a speeding ticket.  I got a ticket.  No matter what, you go, hey, Voss, how you doing today?  Why was that?  Why does it matter?  You know what's fucked up about Long Island?  I was driving to my gig the other night, and all of a sudden I'm driving through the  light, and I see two flashes.  Like, the light took a picture of me. 
[01:52:00]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay, you're a fuck.  You're a fuck.  You're a fuck.  You know you get it.  Yeah, I'll be getting that in two days.  And the light was yellow.  It was yellow.  Well, it must have been red when you were going through it.  Like, they took two pictures.  You got the picture.  That technology's going to be on every street corner, too.  That's fucking unbelievable.  That shit's getting cheaper to put up.  Rich Voss, you are fined $150 with a $30 surcharge.  Can I give you $20 for the surcharge, and I'll give you $125 for the ticket, and I'll  perform at your benefit. 
[01:52:30]  What do you mean?  If you talk, I got a ticket.  If you talk to the prosecutor, you could talk him down.  I know, yeah.  But I'm not going to go to New York for a fucking down payment.  Well, that's a hassle.  Unfortunately, and they know that, so you just pay and move on.  Yeah, fucking this is a scam, man.  Voss drives to the court of that county that he got there.  You have, haven't you, Rich?  No, but I got a ticket up in when I was doing a college.  I was doing a college up in Alfred, New York.  You went back to Alfred?  No, no, no.  You went back to Alfred.  When I got pulled over, my first one is, do you guys listen to Opie and Anthony? 
[01:53:00]  And then that got me nothing.  Then the PBA cards, nothing.  Okay.  Well, PBA doesn't get you anything anymore.  PBA is nothing.  Those cards mean nothing, don't they?  PBA is something you just want to throw.  You need the FOP, man.  There's one card that you buy for like $200 or $300.  You can't buy them.  See?  Yeah, my friend has it.  Patrice, but he can.  My friend.  You forgot your own point.  Of course he's buying these things because he's done that research, too.  You got to ask, can you, PBA, if somebody gives you a PBA, it's like they take PBA cards. 
[01:53:30]  FOP, the Fraternal Order, you need that.  That's the one, right?  The FOP is the one you need.  Where's the one where you make a donation and you get the card and they're like, we like  this motherfucker?  Called a bribe.  Well, yeah.  But the plastic ones, you need one that's made out of fucking, I know you got, you must  have 5,000.  No, I don't have any of the, I don't have any of the, hold on.  You have to have at least, Anthony, how many, how many, you must have 50 FOP cards. 
[01:54:00]  No, I only need this one.  Oh, shit.  What's that?  This is the only one.  And this is the key?  That's the one?  Yeah.  That's that.  And, and on the back, it's got everything written on it.  Oh, this, and this is big, this is, this is bigger than the FOP.  Yeah.  Yeah, this is, this is the, this is the Fraternal Order of bigger motherfuckers than the FOP.  Did you have, did you have to make a big donation for that or something, or was I giving you?  Yeah, I make a big donation every month I pay the Mareskas.  Oh, this is, and he already got you, he already got you one of these, and you know, I know  the guy.  Let me see that. 
[01:54:30]  He just slipped me one of these fucking things.  I got, I got one at the house.  I know the guy.  I'm like, like, we, he, this, this should come with this show.  You're in the second show.  This should fucking come with that, man.  You should get something for it, right?  Are you fucking serious?  I, I got one at home.  I got another one.  I can't be mad at Keith, though, for anything.  That fucker knows how to play poker, man.  Yeah.  He helped me, he helped me play poker, dude.  Really?  Oh, absolutely.  You win money?  You win money, too.  I was the last, uh, people from this show that was out.  And what was this, a tournament that I wasn't invited to? 
[01:55:00]  It's gambling, Rich.  No, it wasn't.  Huh?  It's gambling.  Oh, I don't mind that anymore.  What is this one?  Lifetime member.  You're gambling again?  No.  That doesn't, that does you nothing, right?  Does that does you anything if you go at all?  It gets you discounts at hotels and stuff.  Does it?  Yeah.  A little something, something.  Jesus.  Wait a minute, I'll join.  God damn it.  I don't believe in guns, but if I get a discount on it.  Do you have any, whenever I make a reservation online or something, it says, oh, do you have  any of this for discount?  And I always, I never put it in. 
[01:55:30]  I could probably save fucking thousands upon thousands of dollars if I, if I took one second  to like check into something.  Or if you didn't drink when you were gambling.  No, actually that works.  He really, really, I'll tell you one thing, he really is a sneaky, he goes from just completely  coherent to like, oh shit, this nigga's lushing right now.  He went, he, it took about four good hours.  Yeah.  And, and we were just like, oh, okay. 
[01:56:00]  And then, you know what happened?  You said something mean.  Like you started off nice.  Oh shit.  And then at the end, like after the four hours, you just got, you just said, fuck it.  I'm going to say some fucked up shit to somebody.  And I go, yeah, yeah.  I look, nigga, this motherfucker's drunk as shit.  I was hammy.  I said, this motherfucker just said some fucked up shit to someone.  I called the dealer, I called the dealer a cunt.  Something happened.  I said, uh oh.  And then it's like.  And then some old bat, I was making a lot, like I make a lot of noise at the table, even  having a good time and shit and fun. 
[01:56:30]  It's like, yeah, yeah, that's how it's done.  And then some fucking old bitty, bitchy woman, uh, on the other side of the pit, like was  sitting at a table and she turned and gave me this look.  And I just looked at, I went, what the fuck are you looking at?  What the fuck are you?  I go, turn your head around, you fucking old bitch.  And, and then, you know, people get like, oh boy.  Which is why, which is why our friend is so serious, uh, uh, uh, you know, game.  So he goes, uh, can I say his name on that? 
[01:57:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Keith.  Yeah.  Keith is very serious about his job.  I go, Keith, how come you ain't playing?  He says, I'm working.  He's working.  I go, all right, well, damn, just play a hand.  Oh, you're so good.  And then at the end of, after I see Anthony's shenanigans, I understand.  When you're playing blackjack.  Keith has to keep Anthony out of trouble.  Keith keeps me out of trouble and he, he pays off my market.  You know what, Keith is, you have to see Scarface when he's in the restaurant and, and Ernie.  Ernie.  Yeah, yeah.  Ernie had to talk to the fuck. 
[01:57:30]  Captain Anthony's like, I'm the bad guy.  Fuck you.  And then Ernie has to slide a guy at 50.  Look at you.  I'm excited about this.  How do you not?  You need me.  You need the bad guy.  Look at you bunch of fucking mummies.  Just, I'll pay the bill.  I'll take care of you.  Don't worry about it.  Why can't you, why don't you shoot craps?  It's the, it's the crack of gambling.  It's the best, man.  I make, I make money on blackjack.  But you, you can make more on craps. 
[01:58:00]  Nah, I don't know craps.  You want, you didn't know blackjack until someone taught you.  I don't know.  Crap.  Best odds?  Craps?  Yeah.  Yeah, better than blackjack.  Oh my God, I don't want craps.  It's so much more exciting.  Nah, I like blackjack.  I lost, I was losing once and I, I hit the table, I went, fuck and I threw my hands up and  a waitress had a tray of a hundred drinks right behind me and it went flying in the air and  I just brushed her off like nothing happened.  Go get some more fucking drinks.  I just lost a lot of fucking money.  It's always about a hundred drinks too. 
[01:58:30]  Oh man, they're fucking losing.  When you're losing, it's just like, you know, don't give me shit.  I don't want to talk to you.  Fuck you.  But I should be able to act like, be able to act like an asshole with the action he's  throwing down.  That's true.  Why does it matter that there should be an asshole room?  You know they got a high rolling room?  They should have an asshole room.  Absolutely.  Where you're allowed to call the dealer a cunt, you're allowed to fucking curse, you  could throw shit on the floor, like that's what you're buying by fucking going into this  high, high roller.  It's the nasty high roller room where you could just go, you fucking piece of shit with these 
[01:59:00]  fucking blackjacks you're dealing yourself.  Die, motherfucker.  You know what's funny?  They get mad when you curse, but yet they don't mind that you drink, lose your house,  pick up a hooker after that.  I don't curse.  That's immoral.  Everything, everything is complete evil.  In a casino, but you're not allowed to curse.  Don't fuck yourself.  This agent dealer was dealing me shit and dealing himself great cards, and I yelled right in  the face.  I went, no tip for you! 
[01:59:30]  That's showing her, I'm sure.  I was getting so obnoxious.  That's what I do.  Danny?  It reminds me of actually one of my favorite casino stories that Patrice was at, actually.  It was the hard rock in Vegas when the traveling virus tour was going on.  Yeah.  And Travis, Patrice wanted to sit down and play some three-card poker.  So I remember you pointed at the dealer at one point, and you went, ah!  And the guy was just like, it's not my money.  So Patrice starts pointing at the cameras above the table.  So he's going, ah!  When we were playing, I think we were playing blackjack at one point, too, and the dealer 
[02:00:00]  is dealing out some good cards for the table and busting, and every time the dealer busted,  Patrice pointed right in the dealer's face and went, ah!  It was so fucking funny and flustered the dealer.  You're a lot of fun to gamble with, Patrice.  Oh, yeah.  A lot of fun.  In my short time of hanging and gambling a little bit, something bothers me about gambling.  Yeah.  It's eventually, it gets pathetic.  At first, I'm like having a great time, but I don't drink and shit, so I only run off 
[02:00:30]  my own battery.  I don't have fucking booze, so...  Booze batteries are great.  After, you know, at the slot machine, you know, you sit there and you win a couple of  times, you go, oh, I'm going to keep playing.  After a while, you push the button, like, just...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  There's no more fun.  At first, you're pulling the handle, so you can have some fun.  It's like, oh, I'm pulling the handle, and then you just clink, push, clink, push.  Then it gets really serious and really, really... 
[02:01:00]  I hate fun.  Have you ever seen, I saw a guy, I was playing blackjack once, and he was sitting, he was like,  this, he just lost, he was up, he lost $25,000, and he was so, he was sitting there, and he  didn't know me, he goes, can you give me $10 for another bet, right?  He just lost $20,000, he built it to $20,000, and he lost the whole $25,000, so I gave him  $10,000, like, really, you're going to get that $25,000 back?  It's not going to happen.  With $10.  With $10, really? 
[02:01:30]  It's just, he had to make one more bet.  Right, right, right.  He's always got to make one more.  Did you read the book, Onan Mahoney?  Hold on, hold on, hold on, about the $10, what percentage did you negotiate with the guy?  What was the VIG on that one?  The VIG, yeah.  Oh, I was winning, so I, and another time, also, too.  I'm going to take 5% of everything you win with my 10 bucks.  See, dice, see, blackjack, here's the thing, you're fucking with, when you're playing blackjack,  you're fucking with assholes that don't know how to play, and they're hitting when they're  not supposed to, or they're not hitting when they're supposed to. 
[02:02:00]  Some craps, the only thing you might have is someone who throws your dice too hard and  likes bouncing it all over the place, but you don't have to worry about the motherfucker  next to you going, oh, I'm going to hit when the dealer has a four.  Well, you don't sit at those fucking tables, and then if somebody sits down, you turn around  and you tell them, you go, what the fuck are you doing?  You don't know how to play?  Leave this table.  I go, I'm not betting five bucks a hand here, motherfucker.  Yeah.  You leave.  Or I'll pull my bets back.  I'll pull my bets back when a new Asian lady sits down at the table, you will see me pull 
[02:02:30]  my fucking bets back and throw the minimum bet right in the circle just so I can see what  the fuck she's going to do for you.  It's the same with Crash.  When they're hot, they come over to do the money.  That's when they come over and bring chips.  They always bring it up.  Bring the chips.  Yeah, yeah, they've got to bring it up.  Because the dude's on a roll.  I was playing in Aruba.  I'm not bullshitting.  And when we were, my first wife, we went to Aruba and I got money all over the fucking  table.  I'm on fire with the fucking dice.  Went in like a, it was fucking insane. 
[02:03:00]  And then my wife comes over and touches my arm.  Mush.  Seven fucking out.  You know how bad.  You know how.  I just want to choke her.  And then we got home from Aruba after I took her there and she goes, I want a divorce.  Bitch, you couldn't have told me that a week ago before you touched my arm.  Okay.  Right when we got home from Aruba, I want a divorce.  Let me know something about the gambling.  Less money you had to get her though.  When, when do you get up and go, I'm going to stop right now? 
[02:03:30]  That's the big question.  If you're already that answer, there are, there are differences.  I mean, when do you get up for the evening?  After you win 25 G's, like, when do you just go, I'm up.  There are differences.  I get up when you get chest pains.  I get up when I'm too fucking tired to sit there anymore.  That's when I'll get up.  Up or down.  If I'm up, I'll leave.  If I'm down, I'll leave and say, like, I'll try again tomorrow or something like that.  But Keith is the guy.  Like, I'll sit there and, and play. 
[02:04:00]  And Keith will fucking come by and snatch the fucking chips and go right to the cage.  Pay off markers.  Whatever.  And I'll keep playing with what he left at the table.  Boom, boom, boom.  Like last time, just last time we were at, uh, Mohegan or Foxwoods.  We were at Foxwoods.  I woke up the next morning and I just was like fucking hung over and shit.  I'm like, I was like, Keith, what's the damage, man?  What did I lose?  And he's like, dude, you won 10 grand. 
[02:04:30]  I was like, oh, fuck.  Yeah, because all I remember was yelling, marker, fucking marker, marker.  I do a bit on saying, I'm not doing that, but this is true.  Like, when you go to a casino with, like, your girl or your wife and this is, you know,  you go, you go, hold this money.  Don't give it back to me no matter what I tell you.  And that's what you're doing with Keith.  An hour later, give me my fucking money.  No, no, no, I don't.  Huh?  I don't do that.  Half the casino does that.  Like, you hide money or you hide your wife.  No, no, no, no, no.  Well, see, you got stupid money, so it doesn't matter. 
[02:05:00]  I'll just ask for another marker.  Like, I've sold gold necklaces in casinos.  I'm not saying you can't fucking build poor gamblers out of their fucking money.  I want to gamble against so bad.  I'm at Foxwoods in Fourth of July weekend.  You're getting the itch.  I'm there.  Oh, I shot craps in Seattle.  I'm at the Borgata next week.  This weekend.  You're lucky Jimmy's not here.  Did you or did you not?  All right, get your plugs in.  We've got to take a break. 
[02:05:30]  Oh, I'm in Harrisburg next weekend.  At the Comedy Zone.  At Catch a Rising Star in Rhode Island.  Harrisburg is the door deal, so come to Harrisburg.  All right.  Because I'm doing a door deal there.  Movies next.  And, you know, something we wanted to play Friday.  We ran out of time.  The Uncle Whip and the Nephew.  What?  Oh, yeah, that one.  Also being a gang member?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Making believe he was a gang member?  That's absolutely real.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The research I've done.  That's good.  Yeah.  Yep.  So we'll do that as well.  All right.  Okay. 
[02:06:00]  Excuse me.  Opie and Anthony.  The Opie and Anthony Show on the fire.  Sirius X.  Sirius XM.  Follow the Opie and Anthony Show on Facebook.  Facebook.  Facebook.com slash Opie and Anthony.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, Opie and Anthony, Patrice O'Neal, Big Mama Prods on Twitter. 
[02:06:30]  Your girl's tweeting, I think, there, Patrice.  She's making sure everyone's listening to you on the Opie and Anthony Show.  She's a good girl.  What am I doing?  She's promoting your website, patriceoneal.com.  She's a good girl.  Big Mama Prods on Twitter.  She is a good girl.  I don't deserve her.  I don't deserve my girl.  She's a good girl.  I turned a hoe into a housewife, and she's a good girl.  She's a beautiful woman, man.  She really is beautiful.  She's better than I deserve.  She's definitely beautiful.  But she's still a cunt.  God, is she a cunt. 
[02:07:00]  God, is she retarded, and she's insane.  She hates women.  She hates men.  That's every check on us.  But she's come to grips with it.  Yeah.  And she's a good goddamn girl, man.  I don't know.  You got to weigh out whether they're really good, and it compensates for how batshit crazy  they are.  Because every fucking girl I've ever known is crazy.  Do you know, between my marriage and my second one, I had like 10 or 14 years off. 
[02:07:30]  And I see comics do girls are out of their mind, this and that.  And I go, oh, please, you know, really?  And then, being with Bonnie, it's like you're going, really?  Like, you said, really?  Really?  Really?  I'm trying.  Really?  You're yelling at me because I'm eating my dinner last night?  I ate the whole salad?  You're saying, calm down with my addictive behavior?  Because I ate my salad?  Who's this?  Bonnie.  They're just crazy.  They find it's crazy.  What does she say?  Well, I like to eat. 
[02:08:00]  And she's like, let's get Bonnie on the phone.  He broke it down that all he was doing was eating a salad.  There was so much more going on.  Well, I was picking off their plates, too.  After Patrice said what he said, I can't listen to anything you said.  Now I need the whole story.  Get Bonnie on the phone.  It wasn't about a dumb little salad.  Another thing Voss does.  These are things.  This isn't about salad.  If I get in a position, man, to help the friends I think deserve help,  like one of us make it, and we got to bring up the others that need help,  and it's going to be hard, but I'm going to have to tell Voss, 
[02:08:30]  stop trying to be competitive in things that you have no idea what to be competitive.  Like, me and we're having an off-air conversation,  and we're talking about, like, how this whole crew.  You and Ant?  No, me and Voss.  Okay.  How the whole crew is kind of, we're for real people with for real issues,  and there's a lot of up-and-coming dudes who think that they're gangster, 
[02:09:00]  but they're really not.  But we're old now.  Voss has to come in and just say his story like, you know what I told a fucking...  No, we're talking...  No, yeah, yeah.  When you say...  Wait, let me finish this.  Let me finish this.  Because you can dissect any fucking thing.  Hey, Antony, here's what we...  We did an overall us thing.  Right.  It was an overall...  Thanks, Ken.  Thanks, Ken.  We...  Overall us thing.  Yeah, it wasn't individual. 
[02:09:30]  It was the collective.  You know what?  He comes in and goes, here's what I did.  Well, here's the bottom line.  Here's what I did to this bachelorette party.  I told them one half, bitches.  Here's the thing.  We're talking...  We collectively are trying to be this family of fucking killers.  And he goes, I kill the best.  He always wants to kill.  No, no.  Here's what I did last week.  Here's what I realized, Patricia.  I have to fix that.  Now, here's the thing.  You guys have known each other for way too many years. 
[02:10:00]  Here's the bottom line.  Because, Patricia, you are a better person than me on the outside.  But they don't know you like I know you.  You're crying on the inside.  I quit this.  I quit that.  No, you've just been beaten.  I'm crying on the outside, too.  That's what he's trying to do.  He's trying to psychologically break me down.  That's not his forte.  Yes, it is.  I've been to it now.  I know enough about it.  You know what Voss' forte is?  Get him, Voss.  Go get him.  Go get him.  I don't want to break him down.  I just want him crying.  Go get him, Voss. 
[02:10:30]  And Voss just goes...  Thank you.  And you go down, Voss.  Down.  And somebody else tries to do...  After he's chewed up, then someone else moves in and goes, this is what I tried to tell you.  Yeah.  This is...  You're not going to be able to do this now.  If you don't want Voss to bite you and sick you again, shut up.  It's the phony edginess.  Or then the psychological hammer comes in.  Well, I know a lot about psychology.  Do you?  Do you see what I'm saying?  What do you do? 
[02:11:00]  He doesn't.  I do.  You're wrong.  What do you know?  What do you know about it?  He's not interested in psychology.  Hold on.  I call him 100% wrong.  What do you know about it?  I read like a couple fucking chapters in a Bradshaw book.  All right.  Give us some basics of psychology.  What do you want to know about it?  Anxiety?  Depression?  Do you want to know about it?  You can't list shit.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  Anxiety.  That's a Chinese rule.  But you can't...  Hold on.  Ask me why a person does something. 
[02:11:30]  Ask me why a person does something.  I'll tell you all.  I want to just know the basics of psychology.  You said you know about it.  So let's start with psychology 101.  Psychology for dummies.  Give me your basic shit, Opie.  Basic shit.  Stop, stop.  Basic shit.  Wait.  Let me answer the question.  Let me just say to Opie, what you're doing is not fair.  And I'm going to tell you why.  You know what?  Why?  Here's why I'm saying what I said earlier.  What?  He...  You see how much...  There's no one that can answer that.  Will you ask him a question?  What's the basics of psychology?  Voss is so competitive and retarded at the same time that he doesn't understand that's 
[02:12:00]  an impossible thing he's trying to get into.  Well, didn't I just say give me something specific?  Okay.  I won't give him...  That's fair enough.  It's very difficult to do that.  But, well, slow down.  It isn't.  All right.  Go ahead.  First of all, I did say give me something specific.  But here's the basics.  There's no specifics to psychology.  Here's the basics.  Here's the basics.  All right?  It all breaks down on your inner child.  That's what it all breaks down on. 
[02:12:30]  Okay?  As an adult, you cannot be abandoned.  As a child, you can.  And everything and how you react to situations is from your childhood.  Basics.  There's a...  That's not...  Why are you saying that?  Because he asked me.  Why are you saying that?  But I don't think that's even true.  It is true.  It is true.  That's where every...  What are you talking about?  I'm talking about everything.  You just picked somebody, you asshole.  What's that?  You just decided to say it's all about your childhood. 
[02:13:00]  Yes.  And then...  That's what...  That's what...  Yeah.  What's about your childhood?  Your...  Your...  Your...  What behavior?  The behavior...  All your behavior comes from your fucking childhood.  So if you're acting out, you're...  Basically...  That's like you're saying...  You are acting out as a kid.  All your desire for water comes from the first.  No, that's...  No, that's no.  No, you fucking...  That is.  You're right.  You're right.  He's a fucking asshole.  Listen, you fucking moron.  He said the basics.  He said the basics.  That's the basics. 
[02:13:30]  There's no...  Everybody has their own particular thing that you go...  And it was from their childhood.  Wait, wait, wait.  What if you have a fine average childhood...  Uh-huh.  ...and then at 25 years old, you suffer a trauma, you have a post-traumatic stress disorder,  whatever, something happens.  That completely has nothing to do with childhood.  Can you explain to him what post-traumatic stress disorder is, by the way?  Yeah, doing a show with Rich.  Oh, man.  That's how they're doing...  That's during stress disorder.  That doesn't fall in the category of basics. 
[02:14:00]  That is complete basic.  All right, you asked for...  All right, I got one.  Okay.  Why are you, Rich Voss, so insecure?  Why?  Psychologically speaking.  Because I didn't get enough reinforcement as a kid.  ...from my parents.  Why?  The stories you've told are terrific.  Blame it on your parents.  You just asked me and I gave you a good answer.  I didn't get enough...  It's a terrific Norman Rockwell type of fucking stories you tell.  What kind of stories?  Like the time your mom dragged you into your father's house and said,  here, you take them, I don't want them. 
[02:14:30]  That was my grandparents.  Oh, your grandparents.  I don't want them.  That's good reinforcement here.  You have abandonment issues.  That's why you're always...  That's why you're always like...  Well, why do I have insecure?  Because I come into this fucking battlefield, right?  And I get Twitters from the fucking fat listeners.  We're trying to build you off.  That fucking, you're fucking moron listeners.  That don't even get irony.  I fucking twit.  I'm going on to O&A tomorrow.  I'm going to dress nice.  And these fucking morons, what does it matter?  You fat fucking listeners, go fucking die. 
[02:15:00]  And he won't...  He...  And because he needs the numbers,  he won't block those people.  I know, I block him.  You're wrong.  That's why you're wrong.  I block him.  I just learned how to block him.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with blocking people on Twitter.  Simple as that.  You hear what he added at that last throwaway line.  I just learned how to.  What do you think?  I don't do that shit.  But he didn't say he doesn't.  I just said I block people.  Rich, I blocked three people yesterday.  I'm on your side again because I followed you on Twitter yesterday. 
[02:15:30]  And you did make a joke like,  I'm going O&A and I'm going to dress nice or something like that.  Obviously a silly, dumb, throwaway little joke.  No big deal.  And people were answering him like he was serious.  They're fucking idiots.  Like, the other night...  Can't you pick up on the fact that I was a throwaway line?  The other night...  They don't get it.  The other night at the show, this guy comes up.  He goes, you fucking killed her right on the radio.  Listen, I kill on the fucking radio, you morons.  I fucking 10 for 10 the last fucking...  This is a no-no.  You don't deal with it. 
[02:16:00]  You don't deal with it.  I'll give you a...  You don't deal with these fucking animals, these listeners.  Rich, why?  They're my only fans, really.  You're like, what do you mean I don't deal with them?  Rich, I'll give you 8 out of 10.  That's still good, though.  Go over the fucking goal.  8 out of 10.  No.  10 out of 10.  Today was my slow skate.  I've seen ridiculous stuff written about Patrice on Twitter.  Huh?  I've seen ridiculous stuff on the fans.  And did I spell anything wrong?  I got something for Rich.  I got something for Rich.  What?  Hi, Mommy.  Hi, Mommy.  This might help you.  Hi, Mommy.  This might help you.  Hi, Mommy.  This is for Rich. 
[02:16:30]  Hi, Mommy.  This is for you.  I know I'm doing the same way, Mommy.  I love you, Mommy.  I'm the one that's seen you for the past hours.  And then she might give everybody a hand.  Hi, Mommy.  I'm home.  I told you I was coming this year.  I don't want to do better.  This kid's so be rich, Mom.  I got a haircut.  I love you, Mommy.  I love you, too, so much.  I love you, too, son.  Please don't disappoint me. 
[02:17:00]  That was the second thing after I love you.  I've been praying, Mommy.  What's going on?  I'll return.  Take his headphones off.  Hi, Mommy.  Why did that bother you?  Why did that bother you?  Listen, listen to that shit.  We're breaking down some psychology right now.  Here's the thing.  Why did that bother you?  I'm going to tell you real quick.  I broke the chain of dysfunction in my family.  That's all.  So did I.  Okay, I didn't see you.  High five across the room.  I broke the chain of dysfunction.  Boom.  Me and your brother.  I got, you know what?  Wait, what?  And I'm talking about both of you. 
[02:17:30]  What?  You have to break the chain of dysfunction.  You, too, did?  Listen.  Yes.  Fuck yeah, I did.  You don't pay attention to me in my personal life.  You don't know the first thing about me.  I got all my kids' first tooth that I pulled.  Her first haircut.  I got, Bonnie goes, why do you got your kids' first baby shoes?  Okay?  Because they were the first.  And they were, that's, okay.  I went to, let's say my father's house.  I was doing a TV show years ago and they needed a baby picture.  I go, do you got any pictures?  I mean, I think he had two.  Let me tell you what this show has done, DeVos.  Okay. 
[02:18:00]  Here comes Dr. Patrice.  He just.  And I don't blame him.  I don't fucking blame him.  It's such a war zone.  That a man who should be speaking much slower and clearer just rambles.  Like, he's talking faster than his brain is able to.  I want to hear this.  Because you're like, you know what he doesn't have confidence in?  He doesn't have confidence in a point that might not have to be funny.  So, if you say, if he says something about his kids' baby shoes, that's interesting. 
[02:18:30]  Why do you save your kids' baby shoes?  Because your mom didn't say yours?  Who cares?  They're the first.  He says, why do you save?  I was listening.  Why do you save their first baby shoes?  Because they were the first.  And then he moves on.  Like, you have to fucking explain yourself.  You two go, I broke the chain of blah, blah.  And you gave an air high five.  That's right, man.  And nobody knows what the fuck you talking about.  That's because you're just.  You can't just say that.  Only fucking people that grew up in discussion understand that shit. 
[02:19:00]  What the fuck you talking about?  I'll tell you.  I broke the motherfucking chain of this joke.  I broke the fucking chain of this joke.  I broke the fucking chain of this joke.  Listen, to get serious for a moment, I realized that my behavior, I was doing the same fucking  horse shit my mom did and her mom did to her.  And finally, you wake up one day and go, I'm going to do it different.  I'm going to break it down like this.  That's breaking the fucking chain.  I'll break it down so you understand that.  But in a black neighborhood, okay, a mom will have three times.  Slow down for a second.  Okay. 
[02:19:30]  This is where I grew up.  Can we promise not to cut Ross off?  No, no.  No one cut him off.  Can we promise?  Now, slow down and explain.  And this is where I grew up, so this is what I know.  And within 30 seconds, the wheels will fall off and go.  Because I'm going to tell you why.  He's going to pretend like this wasn't trying to be funny.  No, this is not going to be funny.  I want to hear you say a serious slow story on your side.  I'm going to tell you to break the chain of dysfunction.  Where I grew up and I used to hang on Rudy's porch and hang out with Rudy and Pee Wee and  his family.  And the rest of the fucking Fat Albert game.  Yes, yes. 
[02:20:00]  See?  You fucking asshole.  Go ahead.  Go ahead.  You hung out with Rudy on the porch.  Rudy and Pee Wee and the family.  And fucking Theo.  And fucking.  Okay.  And Rufus.  And Rufus.  And Rufus.  I get it.  Go ahead.  Okay.  Okay, so.  And Mushnuff.  All right.  So the mom.  Voss, you're like a school in June.  No class.  Go ahead.  I'll put you.  Go ahead, Voss.  Let it rip.  Let it rip.  And let's say one of the family members wasn't working and was getting government assistance.  Let's say. 
[02:20:30]  Then the daughter grew up and saw her mom didn't have to work and had kids and got government  assistance.  So did she.  And then her kids grew up and got government assistance because her mother and grandmother  did.  And so one of the, one of the people, somebody in that chain has to break the dysfunction.  Somebody in that family.  Do you know what I'm saying?  What I'm saying is.  You're bad, bro.  You're the worst. 
[02:21:00]  Voss, on your side again.  You're insane.  Fucking rich up.  Shut the fuck up.  I don't know what you're saying.  You really thought that Patrice wanted to hear this shit.  I did.  I set you up so bad.  I did.  What did you see in Breaking Dale?  It's just.  What I'm saying is.  What I'm saying is get a job.  What the fuck are you talking about, nigga?  Get a job.  I did.  He has a way.  God damn, Patrice.  I'm getting touch pain. 
[02:21:30]  I was trying to fucking listen to this bullshit.  I know.  You know what I'm saying.  The daughter broke the chain of.  Because she got a job.  The grandma.  The ma.  Did she broke?  What is this fucking.  Didn't you know where that was going to?  Like the second he started saying it.  Because it's so just Pat.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  All right.  So one dad rapes his kid.  That kid rapes his kid.  Someone's going to have to stop raping.  Okay.  Is that easier? 
[02:22:00]  Okay.  But we get that.  Dad was a drunk.  The kid was a drunk.  His kid was a drunk.  The next kid said, I'm not going to drink.  That's breaking the chain of just fun.  This is a duck that doesn't fly.  Because his father flies.  I'm sorry.  And his father flies.  But I'm not going to fly because I'm going to walk.  Okay.  It's the fucking.  Okay.  It's the fucking stupid question.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. 
[02:22:30]  I'm sorry.  He's the person who was.  Put the Patrice's fucking point that you're talking way too fast.  Take a breath.  Take a breath.  I know.  I'm getting touched.  Here's the thing.  Here's the thing.  Please don't die in our studio.  Explain break the fucking chain of dysfunction.  What do you want?  E equals MC square.  It's easy.  It's pretty fucking self-explanatory.  Why are we talking about breaking chains in front of Patrice?  That's not nice.  Yeah.  Okay.  There you go.  Okay.  Wait a minute.  You're out.  But here's what the problem is.  Here's the issue.  It's self. 
[02:23:00]  It's a self-awareness that breaks the chain.  My mother.  Look.  Yeah.  Do I believe that kids should get beat?  Yes.  I didn't like getting beat.  Right.  But I'm not going to say my mother's beatings.  Sometimes she hit me and it was fucking not necessary.  It was based on her youngness.  And it was based on not.  But did I deserve an ass whooping?  I used to be an arsonist.  I burned shit.  I didn't know this.  You had to call them bridges.  Holy shit.  Oh, yes. 
[02:23:30]  That.  It continues to stay.  But no.  But I tell you.  That one was good.  That was just good.  Oh, okay.  Let's analyze it.  Let's analyze it.  Let's listen in that song.  Don't worry.  There you go.  So I'm going to back it up in a barman within 15 seconds.  Oh, because he's greedy.  Yes.  So.  And he'll try to tell his story about.  Well, I was an arsonist.  There you go.  All right.  I burned and drowned things.  Like, he'll try to say something.  Go ahead.  He'll try to say something better than this.  All right.  Go after my handicap. 
[02:24:00]  Go after my handicap.  Diet drinker.  Yeah.  See.  So.  I want to know about you being an arsonist.  I used to just love watching shit burn.  A lot of us did when we were growing up.  All kids did.  I burned.  You know.  Did you go in the woods and burn some shit a little bit here and there?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right.  Then why was it a problem?  Hold on.  Why was it a problem?  Why was it a problem?  Yes.  Because I think a lot of kids go in the woods and burn some shit.  Hopefully it's a controlled fire.  I don't.  The psychology of why I like to see things burn. 
[02:24:30]  I don't know.  I enjoy burning shit.  But how bad did it get with you?  Like, Aunt and I have told our stories over the years.  Here's how it got bad.  We both had a fire in our childhood that got out of hand, but in general, we started little  fires.  I burned a young, meaning my mother, a young black woman's kitchen floor.  You and your mom burned it together?  No.  I burned it and tried to hide it with a rug.  That was, I burned, it was plastic floors.  Yeah.  No money to get it.  You know, if you fuck up your own house, the landlord ain't coming to fix your own burning. 
[02:25:00]  I burned up screens, like the screens where you light the screens on fire.  They didn't burn.  What they did was just charred, and then you could just poke your fingers through it.  I did that shit, so I finally burned up the floor in the house.  You didn't have toys?  And my mother, yeah.  But my mother fucked me up so bad, that beating.  But, you know, at the time, I tease her about that beating, but at the time, okay, I deserved  that because if my mother said, hey, man, you know, fires are bad, and see, fires can 
[02:25:30]  kill and like some bullshit, I still, I'd be like, what the fuck's wrong with this ass?  She telling me fires burn?  So she beat, what she did was beat fear into me.  So I had a healthy fear until I realized that, what the fuck was I doing?  So she had to beat my ass to put the, for practical reasons, not to convince me that fucking fire  was wrong.  She had to beat me because, because fucking, I just did it.  That if you did it again, you would get that beat. 
[02:26:00]  Yes, it was a practical fear.  It didn't stop you from wanting to burn shit.  So if she put your face on the stove, would that have been okay, too?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because, because if, because somebody else's house would have been on fire.  Yeah.  I would have escalated to something.  You would have kept going, right?  Yes.  Absolutely.  A couple things.  When she beat you, did you feel like you could have taken her?  But you had to take the beating because psychologically you knew you were fucked if you didn't have  her in your life.  The day I realized that half of it was fear was that when 13 and she's called me, I didn't 
[02:26:30]  come and she hit me with a broomstick in front of my friends and I realized it didn't hurt.  And then she realized that it didn't hurt.  That's a big moment.  And then she never hit me again.  So after that, every lesson I learned was on the job training because I didn't have a  father that could punch me in the chest.  There was no upgrade.  It was her mommy arms hitting me with a stick and I went, what?  And I looked at it like, why would you do that? 
[02:27:00]  Why would you do that?  In front of my, what were you doing?  My friends are sitting here.  Oh shit.  And then that was it.  But I would never, to this day, like I never, it was never a threatening thing.  It was like, she realized her arm, it was done.  But it got me up to that fucking point.  I fucked up a lot after that, but she did what she can.  And I, I believe in as being cause the problem with kids, my girl's kid.  Okay.  She thinks she has a say.  She thinks she's a human fucking being and she's not, she's a thing. 
[02:27:30]  She's a fucking thing.  And she should shut her fucking mouth.  But she always is like, I got a question though.  And then why, but why?  Shh, be quiet.  Why?  Cause I fucking said so.  Cause I said, and you're not a person.  I was scared of every single adult when I was a kid.  Yeah.  Fuck yeah.  Cause I thought they all had permission to punch me in the fucking mouth.  And they pretty much did.  They did back then.  Listen, you know what?  Back then, back then, you know what?  That's fucking ridiculous. 
[02:28:00]  Cause it's not your kids do have.  Now here's how, here's how, why he don't think.  He started the whole thing where it's back as a child.  That was his psychological profile.  And now he just tells his name back then.  Now he just said fuck his own fucking theory.  No, no, no, no, listen, listen, listen, listen.  You're saying, so you're saying, you're right.  So you're saying a kid has no say in anything.  Then that's going to fuck the kid up when they get older and they have no confidence.  Cause you didn't let them talk. 
[02:28:30]  Okay.  If you're saying you are a thing and you're not allowed to fucking give an opinion or a  feeling, then that kid is going to grow up.  But your mom.  That kid's going to grow up.  First of all.  That kid's going to grow up not shooting up a school.  No.  And your mom probably.  Cause I said don't shoot up a school.  No, no.  You're saying you're a thing and you don't have a.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Hold on.  You're my property.  The difference between you two is I think your mom took it too far.  No.  And that's the problem.  No, no.  My mom took it too far.  You don't fucking get it. 
[02:29:00]  You don't get it.  I do get it.  No, you don't get it.  Cause when you're saying your daughter, your girlfriend's daughter has not, you can't  don't shut the fuck up.  Don't ask.  Don't talk.  You don't have, you're a thing.  I'm saying that for, for fucking an extra bit of a seasoning to this fucking adult radio  program.  But when she starts talking, I tell her, look, you listen up to a point because I'm telling  you to, because kids do not have the rationale to listen to you. 
[02:29:30]  They don't understand shit.  You buy him something cause you're supposed to, you do this cause you're supposed to, if  you go, look, go to sleep now, why do I have to go to sleep?  Because if you're tired, cause I fucking said so.  That's so true.  The fuck is wrong with you, folks?  That's obvious.  No, that's obvious.  That's why you only have girls too.  You just, you got weak sperm too.  You don't got no boy sperm.  You got no kids.  You got little girls and shit. 
[02:30:00]  Cause I pull out.  I like it on the chest.  I pulled out and she put it back.  I don't want my son to go through what I went through.  And I don't, and I don't want, and I don't want, and I don't want enough daughters.  He just broke the chains.  Cause my daughter probably, God will curse me.  My daughter have 10 pussies on a shoulder and neck and they all work.  All being used at the same fucking time.  Just cause I've been so horrible to women and shit.  That's great.  Patrice, by the way, getting back to the arsonist thing, I always thought you were a good actor, 
[02:30:30]  but I guess not.  Arrested Development, you played an arsonist.  Oh yeah, from the fucking.  See, I remember that fucking show.  I love that fucking show.  And you were part of it.  What'd you burn down?  The banana stand?  The banana stand.  Oh yeah.  Oh right.  Yep.  I don't know.  See Rich, you bring up the early thing.  Yeah.  But then, it's not always about like.  You're right.  And we all grew up in that.  Cause some people have great childhoods and they become fucked up.  They become fucked up.  They all grew up in that great childhoods and no discipline. 
[02:31:00]  And you saw Master and Commander with Russell Crowe.  Yeah.  You know what I'm saying in the movie?  That great scene where he had to talk to this guy cause he's trying to be buddies with  the fucking crew.  And Russell Crowe grabs him and goes, you, they want a fucking leader.  They want a leader.  You can't fucking be friends with these motherfuckers.  You can't be buddy palsy wowsies with your fucking kids.  Cause they're, they're abusive and they're naturally abusive. 
[02:31:30]  They're not even manipulative.  They just go, this punk, he lets me do anything.  No, that's wrong.  That's you.  That's you.  All kids aren't like that.  All kids aren't like that.  They are like that.  Are you pals to your daughters?  They're inherently abusive.  I'll tell them, do this, do that, do this.  And they will take advantage of every little thing.  No, that's human nature will take advantage.  Until a kid has something to say.  That's fucking human nature.  That's worth fucking hearing.  I do like to shut the fuck up.  Yeah, right.  That's 25 years and above.  That's not a kid.  Anybody under 25 years. 
[02:32:00]  When I thought I was being abused, as you grow up and you realize things, you go, wow,  thanks, mom.  Thank you.  You did me a favor by fucking not letting, because I was smart enough to know what's right  and wrong.  Of course.  I just did it.  I just did it.  So I had to have some way to not do it.  Fear of the beating.  I like the Patrice mom, too.  I finally met her.  She's cool.  She's a good lady, man.  She's a good lady.  She's a good lady.  She's a good lady.  Hey, listen.  This leads to the video that we wanted to play Friday.  I'd love to know where you were going to go, Voss. 
[02:32:30]  Huh?  I'd love to know where you were going to go.  You were laughing.  You were going to get it.  Only Patrice would get it.  Let me tell you what Voss said to my mother when he first met her.  He said, you look like Roz G.  No, that wasn't her first name.  Roz G.  Voss said, my mother looked like this big black girl comedian.  You look like Roz G.  That was the first time I met her.  That was her last barbecue.  That was her last barbecue.  But that's the charm of Roz.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  She sort of does.  Hey, can we play this video? 
[02:33:00]  Fuck, nigga.  You fucking...  Patrice looks like Roz G.  I was too scared to go with that, but all right.  Put a little wig on, Patrice.  Oh, shit.  It's not that...  Why did I open myself up to that one?  Danny's fucked up.  Everybody's fucked up on this show.  I wouldn't think to just look up Roz G.  That wasn't even my mind to get a picture of Roz G.  You couldn't get it up there fast enough. 
[02:33:30]  Hey, it leads to the video that we wanted to play Friday  where a father disciplines his kid right on the internet.  Yeah, I want to hear this.  And forces him to put it on his Facebook.  That's his uncle, by the way.  Uncle, I'm sorry.  What's the backstory?  This kid was being a fake gangster online or something?  Yeah, he was...  I don't know the details, but apparently, as the story goes,  he was posting stuff that he was in a gang  or there was some kind of gang...  He was a gangbanger.  ...thing, or he was just portraying...  Something he wasn't.  ...this persona that he wasn't.  And the uncle got word of it and said, 
[02:34:00]  turn on your fucking webcam.  That uncle looks like a motherfucker right there.  You haven't seen this video yet?  No.  Oh, it's great.  First of all, how's that guy on TV with that lip?  Oh, Jesus.  Where was he?  Trent Franks is a congressman.  How miserable is that guy?  He got caught on a fence as a kid.  Yeah, Trent Franks.  That's a hair lip, right?  A Republican from Arizona.  That was fixed.  I bet you that guy is not to be fucked with that guy.  He might have something happen in the nom. 
[02:34:30]  I don't know what happened there.  Wow, Gabriel Giffords is looking all right.  Oh.  No, that's file footage.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  That's one of the things, like, you know there's things you can't overlook with a broad?  That's it.  A hair lip broad.  It's like, I overlook a missing arm before I overlook a fucking hair lip broad.  I think you're fucking right.  Oh, shit.  Let's play this video, though.  So the uncle gets word that the nephew there is fucking doing some bad shit on the internet 
[02:35:00]  that is not true.  Kind of forces his little nephew to come clean.  Yeah, let's.  Puts on the webcam and does this.  This with all y'all people on Facebook, y'all parents, y'all need to stop all these senseless  fucking crimes, all this gang bang shit.  This my fucking nephew right here.  He ain't no gang member.  We don't come from that shit.  You tell him.  All that bullshit, but all that, all that fake, all that thing, but this ass whooping  ain't gonna be fake.  Oh, shit. 
[02:35:30]  Get that on Facebook.  Tell him about that.  Tell him about that.  Tell him about that.  Show him that.  Show him that.  Facebook that.  That ain't good, huh?  No.  We last night knew, huh?  Raise your hand.  I'm gonna stomp your motherfucking ass.  I wasn't lying.  I was.  Tell him you.  Don't tell me.  I know you fucking ass now.  I wasn't lying.  I wasn't lying.  Dang it.  Hey, look, all the fucking killers and all that fake ass rap shit.  Tell him.  That's fake.  We don't come from that shit.  Pull up your pants.  If I go and that motherfucking catch you, any shit, anything, I don't give a fuck if  you say happy birthday, y'all. 
[02:36:00]  I'm gonna whoop your ass.  You hear me?  You know what?  Don't tell me.  Don't tell me.  Now put that on your fucking wall.  Oh, shit.  Oh, shit, man.  Oh, fuck.  You never want that.  That uncle is a motherfucker.  Two things.  That kid is gonna be fine for the rest of his life.  He's gonna be a NASA.  He's gonna be a fucking lawyer.  But the second thing is the uncle should have said in there, I know the motherfucking gangsta 
[02:36:30]  in this family.  Yeah.  Cause that nigga ain't shit.  I know.  It's a bitch.  He's a fucking killer.  Yeah.  Why didn't he put his shirt on for the video?  And then he took his shirt off.  Right.  And then he goes, if you raise your hand, I'll stomp your motherfucking asses.  Yeah.  So he knows some gangsta shit.  So that's probably where the nephew got it from.  And he's holding him with one hand and just beating him with the other hand.  He was copying his uncle the whole time.  I learned it from you, okay?  He's beating him with the belt. 
[02:37:00]  His pubic hair is pretty much fucking popping out.  Right now, that kid's gonna break his shit in a dysfunction.  Oh, Jesus.  And that kid is big enough to whoop that little small.  He is scared shit of his uncle.  That psychological freak.  You know what the thing is?  That strap ain't hurting him.  He's scared the uncle's gonna start punching him in the face.  He's just scared.  He's scared.  Because that strap don't hurt.  He scared him straight.  And what are you gonna do?  When you go up there and they go, yo, let's go.  He's scared to death of his uncle.  Yeah.  How do you think you dealt with it with his fucking posse there? 
[02:37:30]  You punk-ass motherfucker with your uncle.  He might kill his uncle.  He might kill his fucking uncle.  Do you think he got made fun of at school the next day?  Oh, God.  He totally did.  We all just went there.  But then he's like, fuck you.  You go to my uncle, motherfucker.  He ain't gonna kill himself.  Yeah, I think he saves face because his uncle's a scary motherfucker.  I think he saves face at school.  One of my favorite parts of this video is how the uncle's really scary, but there's a big  giant oriental fan on the wall.  Is there really?  Oh, that's great.  And he's beating his nephew.  Ah, yeah, look at a big fan. 
[02:38:00]  It's probably covering a fucking fist hole.  Yeah, that's...  And he's mis-punching somebody through the face.  That's ghetto construction, nigga.  And another favorite part of the video is that you could tell that somewhere in the ruckus,  a phone got knocked over because at the end, the tail end of the video, you could hear  that the phone's been off the hook sound.  Off the hook sound, yeah.  Don't tell me.  Tell them.  Like, he...  Tell them.  Tell them, motherfucker.  But this guy's an internet star now.  Now the uncle's going to be interviewed.  Well, I just thought it was necessary. 
[02:38:30]  Shut the fuck.  Go into his...  I saw the gang, the violence, and we must silence the violence, and he's going to be  all fucking preaching and shit.  Is it auto-tuned?  Oh, it'll be auto-tuned.  Such a black house, too, with the fake plans.  You know the black...  It's got to be...  You can't see there's some horrible picture on the wall.  You know what?  I grew up with the same house, like, wooden spoons. 
[02:39:00]  What am I?  I had the wooden spoons hanging up on the wall.  It was classy growing up, though, but it was wooden spoons.  What was the wooden spoons about?  Hanging up on the wall.  The giant wooden spoon and fork.  Something to break over.  Like, fucking hanging on the wall in the kitchen.  Oh, really?  Yeah, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, and Bruce Lee picture.  Bruce Lee had to be there.  Bruce Lee.  It was really...  It really was a way to live.  We had the old fucking Guinea pictures.  What happened? 
[02:39:30]  The fucking pictures of Venice painted in thick oil paint.  You're talking about last week at your house?  Yeah.  I'm trying to buy one.  Go ahead, Troy.  Hey, how you doing?  I just wanted a comment.  I think I heard Opie say that the guy's pubic hair was popping out.  Yeah.  Nice call, homo.  Yeah, that's great.  Can I say anything else?  Homo.  Is he serious?  Yeah, this is what you have to deal with.  I just read 10 twitters.  I don't even know how to fucking do a funny line.  The fact is, the uncle's fucking pants are pretty much around his ankles, asshole. 
[02:40:00]  That's the point of saying pubic hair.  Right.  And pubic hair is sticking out as he's trying to give his stupid nephew a life lesson.  There's a contrast there.  I just read 10 twitters.  I'm not going to lie.  And this is serious.  And I hope you guys don't take this wrong.  You have the dumbest fan base.  Fuck them.  That's coming from Ross.  And that's coming from me.  There's a small percentage that unfortunately have a big voice out there.  But they think they're funny.  Can I be fair?  There's a lot of non-verbal fans.  Yeah.  Fans. 
[02:40:30]  I know.  I mean, a lot of fans.  I wish they were more verbal.  But they got, they, because they.  I wish those people with a brain had more to say on Twitter and everywhere else.  There's a, there's a few that just, you know, they just, but look, it's very rare.  Like on Twitter, it's very rare I get a real foul one because I will block you.  Yeah.  So you better, you better make it good.  Yeah.  Here's, here's, and this is about me now.  It is about, the ones that come to the shows are fucking, they're smart, they're fan.  They no comp.  They come to the show. 
[02:41:00]  It's the ones that don't, no, the ones that sit there and think.  All right.  Can you, Opie, can you tell them to slow down?  I know.  I'm not going to interview.  Just go ahead.  Just slow down.  Okay.  All right.  Should I, what, what level should I talk about?  I got it, Rich.  Stand up right now.  Yeah.  Stretch a little.  Just stretch and relax.  Just relax, man.  And we're going to watch it.  I'm trying to, will you just go with it for the show?  All right.  Go with it for the show?  I've been doing that for fucking 10 years.  Stretch.  Get, get a little, relax.  He said stand up, Rich.  That wasn't bad.  Come on, folks.  That was good. 
[02:41:30]  That was good.  That was good.  Quick one.  And he looked at his drink as his, as his, uh.  Was that stock material, Rich?  Stock.  He's trying.  He's trying.  His, his, uh.  Oh, what do you call that when you do that in comedy?  You're, uh.  What is it?  Fucking Koi?  Do you want to go there?  No, it's a.  Make people laugh.  Oh, Jesus.  Shut up, you fucking bored op.  Uh, what the fuck is your, your, your call or, uh, whatever.  Anyhow.  Keep trying.  Something like he is, you know, like after a punchline, people do their cigarette or. 
[02:42:00]  I get it, but.  I think it would.  Just a, just a word for it.  But you shouldn't hold a, a crutch.  A crutch.  A crutch is fine, bro.  No, it's not a crutch.  A crutch, I think, is pretty accurate.  Huh?  It would probably be a crutch.  All right.  Will you reach for the drink after you know you just killed it?  It's on purpose.  You do it like as a crutch.  Sit back down.  I think you're relaxing.  Pratt, like a Pratt fall, Pratt, like a, like a.  No, now we're playing charade.  Gimmick.  You started the game, bitch.  Don't try to, don't try to act like you was trying to.  He's nervous as all.  Fuck.  I'm not nervous at all.  Listen, go ahead, man.  A thousand miles an hour. 
[02:42:30]  Yeah, I'm just, go ahead.  What I'm saying about the fans.  All right, go ahead.  The ones, and probably with you and you and Bobby, the ones that trash or this or that,  they, they fucking, they don't come out.  They don't support.  You know what I mean?  Like there's guys that come to the show.  Yeah.  There was a bunch this weekend and they, they get it.  These fucking guys think they're funny.  They'll twit.  All right.  You're, you're, you're twitting stuff that has been said on this show 10,000 times.  What I'm saying is be fucking original or funny. 
[02:43:00]  But I will stay in, in, in, in, in, in, in defense of a few.  The way this show is, we are very, very mean to each other, but it's, it's scientific almost.  Some people don't get, I'll tell you, okay.  Very, very lady trucker.  Oh God.  Like, but she, she wants to get it.  Like, you can feel like she doesn't want to just go, she, she wants to get how to do what 
[02:43:30]  they think is being done on the show.  I'm just saying, there's a lot of people that don't get, you know, Kevin from Kinetic, I  think he gets how to be mean.  Cause it's half of it.  This shit is funny.  And that's what I'm saying.  It's like a lot of guys when you go, Oh, you're a faggot looking at, it's like, it's  like, don't like you're waiting for me to say something, do something that, that, that  compels you to talk.  You know what he, context, motherfucker.  Yeah, but here's the context.  Here's the thing, lady trucker.  Listen, I don't want to know how to put a pallet with a forklift on the back of a truck. 
[02:44:00]  You fucking deliver what you got to do and listen.  Okay.  Because there's no reason that they should try to be fucking funny or this, cause they're  not, that's not what they fucking do.  Jesus Ross, I thought you would fucking let people have it.  No, fuck them.  No, they're not.  Jesus Christ.  You just said you're a nice guy.  I said I was a nice guy.  Yeah, you just said, hey, let people fucking say what they feel.  I'm telling them they can't be funny.  Cause they're not.  They're not.  In real life.  No, in real fucking life. 
[02:44:30]  Go ahead.  At a party, do you want to listen to anybody else's dribble unless they're a  doctor, lawyer?  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  So the phone's off again.  Why can't you listen to that?  Listen to that bullshit.  You think that's hurting them?  Yeah, yeah.  That's hurting them.  That doesn't hurt them.  That's fucking hurting them.  Yeah, there's someone's scar tissue now.  All right.  You wish you could go up to your mommy and do that, right?  I'll tell you what she said.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy.  Hi, mommy. 
[02:45:00]  She's drooling.  She won't know.  It's me.  Hi, mommy.  Oh, shit.  She doesn't know.  All right.  I'm going in tomorrow to tell her a fucking happy holidays.  She doesn't know.  I didn't go over Christmas.  I never.  He's like, why is this?  I'm halfway thinking, hey, man, stop teasing Rich.  I'm halfway going.  What the fuck?  He deserves it.  He fucking deserves it.  Steve from Bayshore gets it.  Yeah. 
[02:45:30]  There's some guys that get it.  But we're getting so inside because I have to listen to that.  Somebody used to call from Bayonne.  That was great.  Bayonne.  Who was the guy?  There's some guys that get it.  You know.  Yeah, they get it.  They're funny.  Twitter people that follow the show.  Yeah.  People that, you know, we all got our fans that are not the show fans.  Right.  But the guys, we're talking about the guys who are the show fans.  And they have.  They get it.  All right.  We're going to take one last break and then we'll finish up.  With the movie that Rich thought was great. 
[02:46:00]  I want to talk about True Grit because Patrice had a great tweet about that.  Maybe other movies.  I don't know.  And some other shit.  Where are you going to be, Rich?  I'm going to be in Rhode Island, Providence this weekend at Catch the Rising Star.  Those guys that come out all the time.  They know what they're doing.  And Harrisburg next week, the Comedy Zone.  Door deal.  I need hundreds of people.  This is the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM.  And the grand.  And now.  And now.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  On the virus.  Sirius XM. 
[02:46:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  True Grit was number one at the box office.  I mention that because Big Mama Prods on Twitter, a great one to follow, really, is Big Mama Prods.  He writes some funny-ass shit.  You know what?  That would be Patrice O'Neil.  I had a complaint about some of the comics just using Twitter to plug gigs.  It's annoying.  Like, comics that do funny guys. 
[02:47:00]  Like, Jimmy Norton fucking guy tweets funny shit all the time.  And then it's like, oh, I'll be at this gig.  I'll be doing this.  Some comics, though, it's just like.  It's just plugging.  I had to tell Joe DeRosa.  I had to tell him.  I go, I'm going to stop following you.  Because all you do is plug gigs.  That's because he barely gets them.  Oh, okay.  And Joe's a funny guy.  He should be able to tweet some shit.  You put yourself out there to be ridiculed.  Right, right.  Some people are tender.  They're very tender.  Joe's a sweetie puss. 
[02:47:30]  He really is.  He's a sweetie guy.  He's a sweet guy.  He tries to, you know, he rolls in this mean world.  But Joe's a honey child.  He's a funny motherfucker.  He's a tickly motherfucker.  He really is.  He is funny, man.  You know, because he's Egyptian and shit.  You know, them Egyptian people, they don't have no fucking sense of humor.  But the beauty of Twitter, like, if you don't have confidence in a line you're about to tweet,  sometimes I'll tweet one.  I'm like, I don't know if this is going to go well.  And I'll just turn all my shit off for two hours.  It's all there.  And then by the time I get back, they're on to other stuff.  And they're not going to comment on the bomb I just tweeted. 
[02:48:00]  Mine's always nasty or confrontational.  But you know what, Joe?  That's my only tweet.  Just go fuck yourself.  Yeah.  Fuck you.  I enjoy my Twitter followers because I enjoy the fact that they understand me.  It's a privilege and an honor to be in contact with me on any level.  Right.  It is.  I don't give a fuck.  We're not the same.  I'm in show business.  Right.  People know me.  You know what I mean?  The business of show. 
[02:48:30]  I mean, for real.  Yeah, you can recognize.  It's like having a phone number.  And you go, wait, did somebody call?  It's like somebody calls you and go, you're a fat fuck and I hope you die.  And you go, hey, I'm changing my phone number.  How'd you get my number?  These people have my number.  Twitter is that.  Big Mama Proz is my phone number.  So you call me, dude.  You don't have to be pleasant because I'm not a pleasant.  But you have to be in my fucking realm of pleasantries.  My shit. 
[02:49:00]  Don't be on your own shit.  God, you just nailed it.  Big Mama Proz is your fucking phone number.  That's your phone number.  OP Radio is my fucking cell phone.  And people can maybe get one call in if you block them.  Like they at least have one call.  Make it good, Mama Proz.  They can make it to you.  And you only can make it.  And if you're stupid, you can't use those 140 lines that fucking.  No.  Boop.  If you have to have 140 things, you're a rev...  Goodbye.  How long does it take to block 11,000 people?  Listen, let's go back to that quote from Patrice. 
[02:49:30]  So True Grit finally beat out the little fuckers at the box office because we've decided on this  show we're not playing the game.  It's fuckers.  Little fuckers.  Oh, I remember.  This is what Patrice tweeted about True Grit.  I thought it was brilliant.  True Grit is the best boring movie ever made.  Two hours of wow.  This shit sucked, but it held me.  Who's in True Grit?  Five stars or one star?  I don't know.  That's a brilliant tweet.  Jeff Bridges was good.  It was phenomenal. 
[02:50:00]  Look, I'm addicted to the...  Other than the fact they don't have niggas in none of their movies, I'm addicted to those  two brothers.  Coen brothers.  Those Coen brothers make great films.  They know how to make a movie.  I love their movies.  But this one was...  Afterwards, I went, huh?  What happened?  But it reminded me the same way it hit me how I've seen Unforgiven 50 times.  Yeah.  And I still go...  Unforgiven.  I still go...  I don't...  What's the lesson I'm learning here?  I don't know what this is. 
[02:50:30]  It's just...  It's drivel, but it's fantastic.  Yeah.  True Grit was just...  The little girl was one of the best child performers in a movie.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've ever seen.  She was phenomenal.  Really good.  What she played.  This little asshole.  Yeah, a little fucking...  This little tough cunt.  Western.  Yes, a cunt was what she was.  Yeah, yeah.  She was really cunty.  And she was excellent.  Yeah.  Usually kids bug me in movies, but she was so good.  And Jeff Bridges was, you know, he's going to get an Oscar nomination. 
[02:51:00]  Yeah, I think so, yeah.  They underused Barry Pepper.  They underused...  Barry Pepper's really good.  Spoiler alert, motherfucker.  They underused Brolin.  Yeah, yeah.  They overused Matt Damon.  Yep.  And it's just, it was unceremonious.  It was just like, you know, like Barry Pepper's was supposed to be a bad motherfucker. 
[02:51:30]  Yeah, what was...  And his bad motherfucking-ness was...  It just wasn't...  There wasn't enough.  You're right.  There wasn't enough of him.  I'll tell you what it was.  Here it is.  It was like watching the actual West.  It was like watching how the West really actually was with boring shit.  And you get shot, and you need to ride really fast to the hotel. 
[02:52:00]  Because the Western guns never really killed you right there.  You had to ride as fast as you can to the local...  To get to someone that's going to fucking patch you up.  It just was strange, that move.  But I enjoyed it.  I liked it.  I thought it was very reminiscent of the old-time Western and done up.  Like, there wasn't all the CGI or anything like that.  It was guys on horses fucking having some gunfights and smart-ass remarks and shit. 
[02:52:30]  That's why I liked it.  I fucking...  It was...  I gotta see it.  Like, my favorite Western of all time is probably...  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  It's probably Silverado.  It's because there's an element of not the West.  No.  510 to whatever.  To Yuma, whatever that fucking...  The remake that Yuma...  510 to Yuma.  The new one?  You know, that was a good one. 
[02:53:00]  510 to Yuma was...  Whatever the fuck it was.  God damn, was that good.  He just...  But that would make sense in the...  He's never disappointed.  The Jedi, I guess.  The 615 to...  To Allentown.  To Clermore.  He just...  What?  I don't even know the real name of the movie now.  It was 310, okay.  It was Russell Crowe.  Did you say 510 to Yuma?  510 to Yuma.  Yuma be there.  I know it's great.  Up and over.  I was watching you and Ant discuss True Grit. 
[02:53:30]  Actually, I wasn't watching you, because I knew you guys had a great handle on it.  I was looking at Rich to see how he would fuck it up.  Well, no.  And he said the good question I gave him.  But you went 510 to Yuma.  Because this is...  It was a while ago.  I haven't seen it in a while.  This is why I swear to God I'm going to work hard.  I think I'm coming out of retirement, because I'm going to fuck...  I'm putting Voss on, because here's what he did.  Voss didn't prepare...  He just wanted in.  No, I didn't. 
[02:54:00]  That's what I was watching to see what he would do.  He didn't take the time to think of...  Because he doesn't give a fuck about the 712 disconnected.  He doesn't care.  Okay, how about maybe...  He's not in the conversation.  Why don't you...  Well, first of all...  We really like True Grit, and we're getting ready to go into a place where...  Oh, jeez, it's me, me, me.  I'm trying to get in, because you don't shut the fuck up.  We get ready to go...  Good point.  We were...  No, no, it's not a good fucking point.  Yes, it is a good point. 
[02:54:30]  What do you say?  Transfer to Jamaica, to Penn Station.  510 to Penn Station, to transfer to Jamaica.  Okay, here's the thing.  What do you like about the 310 to Yuma?  Thank you.  What do I like about it?  Yes, because you had to, like, jump in on it.  Well, here's...  Now, I bet you don't even know what the fucking movie was about.  Now, you're talking about psychological?  Yeah.  Page one of the horse shit manual.  I had a horse shit manual.  What did you like about 310 to Yuma?  I didn't know. 
[02:55:00]  What did I...  Let me tell you the best...  What did I like about 310 to Yuma?  Oh, no, 510.  He said 510 to Yuma.  I'll tell you the main thing I liked about 510 to Yuma.  For an hour and 45 minutes, I didn't have to talk to Bonnie.  We could just sit and watch it.  Nothing on that one.  What I liked was...  Why do you beat her up so much?  Because you're the short end of the stick of that relationship.  I'm the short end of every stick.  What are you doing to poor Bonnie?  She can't even defend herself.  That's why he beats her up.  Oh, here we go.  I wasn't wondering how to realize.  Why did I let this motherfucker ruin everything?  That she made a giant mistake. 
[02:55:30]  You made a giant mistake marrying Bonnie?  No, she's great.  Here's my favorite movie that I've seen recently.  What I said before.  Don't let him leave.  No, no.  510 to Yuma.  Yeah, I don't even know if you know...  What was it?  Don't let him talk his way out of 510 to Yuma.  What's the...  Russell Crowe was, first of all, was fucking...  Get the actual synopsis of this movie.  I'm shutting my mouth, but this motherfucker, man.  Go ahead.  It was a while ago.  Rich, in what I like... 
[02:56:00]  I've seen Siloano came out in 87.  Fuck what you liked about it.  What?  Give...  In one minute, explain 510 to Yuma to everybody.  In one minute?  One minute.  What was the movie about?  That's all I want right now for you.  A guy on a mission.  A what?  A guy on a mission.  We're not going to let you off the hook.  A guy on a mission.  That's every movie I've ever made.  Well, that's...  You know what?  That's how I look at it.  I keep things simple.  What was it about?  I don't break them down.  Okay, I'll give you my...  And then we're going to have the actual...  And then we're going to have the actual story line.  Give me the story line of 510 to Yuma. 
[02:56:30]  And Silverado, if I say Silverado is my favorite Western, I was going to go into...  Why is your favorite Western?  Well, because you're a better man than me, and you probably do...  I'm not a better man.  You probably do much better on par sixes.  What I'm saying is fucking Winter's Bone.  Okay, I just saw Winter's Bone.  And now I know, and I learned, par six is ridiculous.  Yes.  But there are courses that have par sixes.  Yeah, like two in the country.  But it doesn't matter.  You'll never...  Now you'll never again... 
[02:57:00]  But I did not poke my mouth out saying, I didn't go...  Very right.  Par six, motherfucker.  You interrupted and with the confidence of an asshole said, 510 to Yuma.  They said, they said, what was your...  Listen, when they said, what was your favorite Western, okay?  No one asked that.  You just came in with it.  No, no.  He said, what's your favorite...  It's 10 to 10 right now.  It's 10 to 10 right now.  Well, Winter's Bone, I'll tell you, because I just saw what I liked.  No, we're not letting you...  510 to Yuma. 
[02:57:30]  Because I don't remember.  All I know is I liked it.  But Winter's Bone, the characters...  Now he's going to just talk about a movie that he fucking knows.  You know Jaws.  Okay, days of wine and roses.  Here's the thing.  Winter's Bone, I know that movie.  Winter's Bone, the casting in that, the characters...  Is this a recent movie?  How did we leave from Yuma?  I have confidence enough to allow him to get past the 510 to Yuma.  Okay.  What is this new movie?  It's not new. 
[02:58:00]  It's on video.  I just saw it.  How old is it?  It's in 2010.  It's up for Golden Globes.  Relatively new movie.  Tell us the storyline of this movie you like.  Winter's Bone, what I like.  I'll tell you what I like.  No, first I'll tell you what I like.  The cast, the characters, one...  Oh my God.  You didn't even think they were actors.  You thought they just picked them up and artists.  This is stock movie review shit.  What is the storyline of the movie that you liked, that you saw recently, that you didn't  have time to forget?  Huh?  What's the movie about?  The movie's about a girl trying to find the truth about her dad. 
[02:58:30]  Okay?  Trying to find the truth about her dad, and she's holding her family together at 17 years  old, and the girl's going to win an Oscar for it.  Okay?  Chick flick.  No, it's not.  No?  No, I'm telling you, it's a good fucking movie.  I'm trying for that.  Okay.  What is the fucking movie about?  I just told you.  I just told you.  No, we're going with the other one now.  Winter what?  Winter's Bone.  And get Ryan Starr in here.  He's going to play us out today.  Winter's Bone.  Yeah.  Winter's Bone.  I'm telling you, if you watch the movie. 
[02:59:00]  All right, what'd you say?  A 17-year-old girl?  Yeah, she's trying to hold her family together.  Her mom's fucking bugged out, got mental issues.  The dad is fucking...  Hi, Molly.  ...is dead somewhere.  Hi, Molly.  ...is dead somewhere.  Okay?  He can't listen.  The boss takes the headphones off every time.  He can't listen to that.  Okay.  Is that the real story?  Patrice, would you do me the pleasure of reading the real storyline?  That's what I just said.  Patrice seems a little different than what Rich just said.  Family intact. 
[02:59:30]  I just said that.  An unflinching Ozark mountain girl hacks through dangerous social terrain as she hunts down  her drug-dealing father while trying to keep her family intact.  Just watch the movie.  He missed a few things.  The entire reason to watch the movie.  Listen.  First of all, enough of analyzing me.  We're not analyzing you.  I got a fucking $7 Rolex.  Go fuck yourself.  It's like Vos goes...  Let me tell you something.  Um, uh, three plus three is six.  Oh, here's a student voice.  Or three plus three is ten. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah.  And we go, Vos, it's six.  And he goes, see, I see what you're doing.  You're attacking me.  No, no.  Vos!  An unflinching Ozark mountain girl.  Yeah.  What you said made me sick, and I'm not going to go see it.  Hunts down.  You...  Hunts down her drug-dealing father while trying to keep her family intact.  You're the reason I don't want him to change Huck Finn.  Because of what? 
[03:00:30]  Because of...  Oh, nothing.  Oh, the...  Nigga, I had to go back to Mark Twain?  Did you just use...  Come on.  You didn't think that was a good...  No, come on.  Get the fuck out of here.  Nigga, I read this like you.  I read this in...  Since I was a baby.  They're changing it.  They're changing it.  We know.  But what does that have to do with how...  This is exactly...  While trying to keep her father and her...  She's hunting down her father, trying to keep her...  You didn't say that.  A big deal, because I said she didn't... 
[03:01:00]  She's trying to learn the truth about her father.  Yeah, that's what I said.  Yeah, I know.  She's hunting...  Okay, watch it.  I'm not trying to find the truth about her father.  She's hunting down her drug-dealing father.  Is he alive or is he dead?  I don't want to give you the ending.  A big deal.  Oh, please don't.  So I didn't say she's going through the...  I think you just described Nemo.  She's going through bushes in the mountains.  Big deal.  That's not the fucking plot.  You fucking guys.  You know what...  Wait a minute.  No, you do it to yourself, Rich.  What's that?  Rich, but we...  I did start this with saying I liked 5'10 to you, Mo. 
[03:01:30]  Let's not forget.  You know what he just said?  What?  He just said something that in his...  In his, like...  His whole thing of his defending himself, he said a line in it that he threw away as  if it was...  It was mediocre.  Yeah.  And it was irrelevant, but it made it...  What, you want me to tell you that she's fucking running through the woods hunting down  her dad?  Yes!  Why does it matter where she's...  What does that matter?  For me to go see the fucking movie, Mars!  You don't have to... 
[03:02:00]  You have to go.  Rich, it's on video.  I even said...  I even said it sounds like a chick flick.  Right.  The way you described it sounds like a chick flick.  We know it's not a chick flick.  I'm only coming here along for now on.  It sounded like a fucking chick flick.  No, just watch a movie.  I was like...  He killed the whole town.  Who?  Ant was telling about a movie.  I forgot the name.  But you was...  The guy...  Oh, shit.  Lenny Marcus.  The guy...  The guy put...  Oh, fucking that maniac guy.  It's like Rampage.  Is that the name?  It's called Rampage.  I ran to get that movie that day as soon as I heard the description of the movie. 
[03:02:30]  Twisted.  Like, that was a great movie.  Yes.  I want to see this movie.  He's not a movie critic.  Yes, he is.  He's a guy who watches a movie that...  No.  Wait.  You think I should see the movie?  Oh.  Not by what I...  Not by my description.  He does.  And he just throws himself in the shitter.  But see it.  That's the last thing he does.  That's the last...  What's up, Ryan?  That's the...  There he is.  How you doing? 
[03:03:00]  How you doing, man?  In the end, that's what you do, Rich.  What's that?  You just give up and throw yourself in the shitter.  What the fuck?  Just go see the movie.  What the fuck?  But we want to know why we should see the movie.  Because it's good.  Because I'll say it again because a lot of people are talking.  Ant goes, oh, that sounds like a chick flick.  Which makes people go, yeah, I ain't seeing that.  Horseshit.  Then we fucking see the real storyline and go, it seems like it's a really good movie.  Okay, well, maybe you know what?  I'm not a fucking movie critic.  It's just...  You don't need to be a movie critic.  You just got to be able to describe something.  Winter's Bone, did you see it? 
[03:03:30]  Oh, no.  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  Ryan started to see that.  Black Swan.  Nah, Black Swan.  Nope, I'm looking at Black Hippo now.  Oh, shit.  Oh, damn.  You know what?  He's getting desperate.  He's going to the fetch.  But that was fucking actually good.  Oh, thank you for validating it.  He is, he is, really.  You're not even a player.  You're fucking a thousand.  Really?  You went after how I talk and that, and really? 
[03:04:00]  Really?  That's been done two million times.  Really?  Really?  That's Stark Voss.  Okay?  Okay.  He just went Stark Patrice.  He's easy.  All right.  So, when he does it, it's okay.  Let me tell you something.  You two are fucking...  I didn't know you wanted me to tell you something.  You tried to.  Why are you putting...  Because I hate you, and I don't want to hear that.  This is keeping the fucking sound out.  I should have done this earlier.  He doesn't want to put a winter coat on, but you're going to put a headband on.  Oh, let's find what's wrong with him for that. 
[03:04:30]  But why don't you just get a little coat?  Hold on, these fucking garage band guys in here.  Let them fucking sing his songs.  Jesus, whoever the fuck he is.  I know he's probably voted for fucking Obama.  You can tell he's got a rainbow decal.  I'm sorry.  I'm just...  I want to see.  I got the same necklace.  He's a Jew.  I'm sorry.  Oh, really?  That was not going to make fun of me.  I'm sorry.  See, you like your fellow Jew.  I like a Jew like him, because he's not a typical Jew.  That's why I like him.  What's a typical Jew?  Typical or tattoos?  Oh, fuck.  My beard makes you look like a rabbi, no? 
[03:05:00]  Look at this.  Huh?  No, it makes you look like a terrorist.  You got a little rabbi beard.  It does, right?  Kind of.  People think I look like a...  Ryan's been a...  He's been a friend of the show for a while.  No, I know.  He's got a new...  It's fucking good.  I listen to him all the time.  You can be a mob.  He understands that shit.  But he's going to sing us out.  Are you going to be in Harrisburg?  Not this weekend.  Next weekend?  Because I'm at the Comedy Zone.  No, but I like Harrisburg.  I've been there.  Yeah, I'm going to be at Webster Hall in New York City, though. 
[03:05:30]  January 18th.  Fuck.  Yeah, he's good.  He's starting to fucking move, man.  That's what I'm saying.  Ron, he's starting to move up the charts, right?  He's starting to move up here.  You guys are like the first guys ever to have me on the air.  I wouldn't put that on my resume.  It didn't help us.  I think we pretty much were the first radio show we ever did.  Are you kidding?  I just do this out of fucking dysfunction.  You know what?  Before we stop talking about movies, but we did already, but I don't care.  No, let's keep going.  I'll be thrown under the bus for this, but it was a funny fucking movie. 
[03:06:00]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.  I know what he's going to say.  It stunk.  What?  The one with fucking, where there were cops.  The other guys.  You laughed at that?  Yes, I did.  Oh, I really hope your gun backfires.  I haven't seen it.  You're like the other guys.  I haven't seen it yet.  You know what?  Give us a fucking funny.  Now listen to how he explains why it was funny, Rich.  You can learn something today.  You know what?  Mark Wahlberg is almost doing a Dirk Diggler character in this fucking movie. 
[03:06:30]  And it's the typical kind of cop movie with the hero cops.  And then there's the guys in the background.  This is the story about the guys in the background.  So Sam Jackson and The Rock.  Oh, I see.  I see.  They're like the hero cops.  The concept is already interesting.  Yeah, yeah.  We've all seen the cops.  And then there's the smartest guys in the room, you know, in the detective, you know,  the squad.  It's like Starsky and Hutch.  You know what?  And it's the other dudes.  It's the other guys. 
[03:07:00]  Voss.  I know you think I'm against you.  No, really?  But already.  You think he's against Anthony?  No, he's against me.  He's doing this with Anthony to make me look like him.  I don't think so.  I'm telling you.  I know what he's doing.  I don't think so.  The concept of that concept is interesting because they're talking about the dudes who  aren't Starsky and Hutch.  Who aren't the guys.  That's not funny to you already?  That's not interesting.  Listen to me.  This is what held the movie together.  Mark Wahlberg was fucking funny.  His character was great. 
[03:07:30]  It was great.  He didn't like the movie when Dan said it.  You can still like a character or like...  You don't have to like a movie to like...  All right.  Now I'm not going to see it.  Good.  It's on video.  Yo, I've listened to this show for years.  I can't believe you guys aren't talking about Black Swan.  That I thought would be the topic of conversation right now.  I didn't see it directly.  Supposedly people are telling me to go see this fucking movie.  It's a chick flick.  It's a chick flick.  Let me tell you something.  Some will say, oh my God, I just watched a ballet movie.  It's not a ballet movie.  The best masturbation scene ever recorded on film in the history of film. 
[03:08:00]  Who's doing it?  Natalie Portman.  Yeah, Natalie Portman.  She's a hot...  She's become a hot person.  She's the queen of the Jews.  You're not going to ruin the...  You're not going to ruin it for us.  I just made you want to go see it.  But why is she making the best masturbation scene?  It's incredible.  Have you ever?  Because she does things that you go, I didn't know they'd do it like that.  You know?  This guy, he's really focused because he don't watch porn because...  Have you ever?  I saw a great masturbation scene and...  Have you ever?  And she used that guitar you had. 
[03:08:30]  The other guys...  Anthony, why was that?  So it's the story of the guys in the background.  Yeah, yeah.  And they slowly, of course, you know, they got to go with the pat story of they get involved  in a big crime and they have to deal with it.  But Will Ferrell is funny in it, but he's not a good cop.  And it's them two kind of bumbling their way around.  And there's some very funny parts and funny lines.  Can I have the copy that someone gave you?  No, I think it's available on demand. 
[03:09:00]  Have you ever masturbated?  Yeah.  Have you ever masturbated and go...  You know, like you get so excited when you're masturbating right before and you think to yourself,  all right, maybe I'll just taste a little of it right before.  But after you come, you go, I can't do it.  You know, have you ever tried?  Have you ever thought about it?  No, I really never.  Have you ever thought just to see what it would taste like?  No, no.  Have you ever thought to, for real, be for real.  I've gone down on a girl after I've shot in her.  I've never done that.  But I wouldn't, like, stick my tongue way deep in. 
[03:09:30]  I'd just lick the clit.  But you can still taste a little tang there.  No, but the dirtiness of shooting a load on your stomach, you think, maybe I can...  No, I'm not going to shoot a load on my stomach and eat it?  What the fuck?  I never have.  I never have.  But you never thought about it?  No.  Oh, okay.  Voss has a minute number.  A very minute number of shit he know about.  And he's going to segue into this fucking masturbation. 
[03:10:00]  He's come tasting.  He's talking about...  But here's the thing.  You're blaming him for your career, though.  But here's the thing.  My career is great.  Hey, hey, he fucking...  Oh, here we go.  And here's some more...  Wait a minute, though.  I'm just saying.  All right, doctor, let's go.  We go from the highest levels of psychologically profiling people to just basic, hey, what'd  you see at the movies?  And he can't even say what he saw at the fucking movies.  If we really did run the gamut of intellectual talk to just nothing... 
[03:10:30]  You think he comes in here as water cooler shit?  I taste my cum.  And he had it thrown in, I taste my cum.  I got it.  I'm talking about masturbating.  You think he comes in with just five things he wants to get out?  And he just waits and waits.  I implore you to go through Voss's file.  He was in a hotel.  And see if he talks about anything other than five subjects.  Like, don't run, bitch.  Sit down.  I'm standing, ho.  Sit down.  I'm standing.  Rich, you are great on this show, but I'm never able to explain why you're great to 
[03:11:00]  anybody.  Wow.  I'll say it.  Oh, really?  How about your time when...  No, because it's not...  Because you can't just break it down.  You can't...  Hold on, hold on.  You can't break it down.  You can't break it down to people and go, because he's really funny.  It's way more than that with you and this show.  So, you're funny, absolutely.  Okay.  But the reason you're great on this show, I can't explain to anybody.  They have to hear it for themselves.  I'll tell you why.  And I've never said this. 
[03:11:30]  Voss is truly dumb.  All right.  There you go.  I didn't realize I just explained it.  It's honest dumb.  That is honest.  It's real.  He's as real dumb as you fucking get.  I got more money than you.  I don't know that.  I do.  Brad Axelrod didn't tell me that.  Oh, shit.  That's because he doesn't take your calls.  I don't take Brad Axelrod.  You just worked for him.  Shut up.  I didn't take his calls.  You just worked for him.  And even though he's been around for whatever years, there's an innocence to him. 
[03:12:00]  It is.  Rich has an innocence.  But a mean, and he's like...  How is that possible with all the shit you've been through?  He's like a retard with a knife.  Like, he'll just say some shit like, I got more money than you.  Like, that's just like a retarded man taking a swing with a knife.  I'm going to see the other guys.  I saw the social network over the weekend.  See Winter's Bone.  Oh, is that the social network?  Loved it.  Can I have it?  Can I borrow it?  Are you sure it's not Summer's Bone?  Let's make sure that it's the right... 
[03:12:30]  It comes out tomorrow.  Because somebody's out there looking for 510 to candy yams.  He said 510 to YUMO.  7-Eleven to Yahtzee.  I think we're done.  But we do have Ryan Starr.  I'm sorry.  It's been a crazy day.  I love it.  So what have you been up to really quickly there, Ryan?  I've been touring my ass off since...  Are you starting to make it?  Because I don't know.  This guy does fucking tons of us.  No, Roland says you are. 
[03:13:00]  Yeah, man.  No, no.  You're moving up the charts?  Top 20 on radio right now.  You can play a second of it, man.  Start a Fire.  It's called...  You know what I'll do for you?  That's the new song.  Top 20 on regular radio.  I want you to play some live, and then we'll end with what's moving up the charts.  No, no.  Hold on.  Yeah, I was going to tell you.  Give me a minute.  I was going to tell you about this song, man.  But you got a CD out?  I do.  It's called 1159.  Came out a few months back.  Too yummy.  It came out a few months back, and it's been torn my butt off, man.  Do you marry, dude? 
[03:13:30]  I am, yeah.  Interesting.  Lots changed.  Took yourself off the market there, huh?  Did you get married before the fame?  It's a continuous...  A Jewish girl or a non-Jew?  Girl, Long Island girl, man.  From the hood.  Yeah, lucky man.  Wait, what town?  Uh-oh.  Where I grew up.  Huntington.  Oh, yeah.  That's all right.  Okay.  I thought you were going to say Bayshore.  Is it racist over there?  Top of the town?  Racist over there?  Nah.  Yeah, the Long Island Expressway chops Long Island.  Just racist.  Huntington is good.  It's a racist two seats from you. 
[03:14:00]  Yeah.  But no, seriously, man.  We had a song on VH1.  It was on the top 20 on VH1 for a while.  A song called Breathe that actually was a very New York video.  We got real unemployed people to be in the video and try to get them to work by setting  up a website for them.  It could be.  You know, it's a funny shit.  It's just, you get out there and I see so much, so many people using these opportunities  for such, you know, nonsense that it was nice to be able to do something positive.  I like the nonsense myself. 
[03:14:30]  But now it's, yeah.  Why should he waste all this horse shit on marriage?  You know how much fucking spiritual pussy this guy can get?  Spiritual pussy from bitches that's just like, ah, yeah.  Bitches with fur hats and fucking, yum, yum, yum, yum, they mom, bunch of Buddhist pussy.  You know how much Buddhist pussy?  This fucking full of shit, motherfucker.  The Jewish Billy Jack.  This motherfucker.  God damn, I'm jealous of this guy.  All right, fucking let's hear this music, man.  This is going somewhere, not just on my stomach. 
[03:15:00]  You know what I mean?  God damn it, son of a bitch.  He just smashed you.  Huh?  He just smashed you.  No, he smashed you.  Oh.  He just smashed me.  Fucking boss, man.  You thought he was smashing Patrice, that he was smashing you.  He's basically, he's not a smasher.  No.  Even if he, what, he's saying, hey, I love you.  I love my wife, and at least it's not going to bullshit.  He goes, my cum is going inside and not on my stomach.  He meant cum.  Because I work your own a lot more.  You cum eater.  Now, Ryan Star.  Cum eater.  Why don't you play a song for us? 
[03:15:30]  So, this song is called Brandy Day, and it's actually the theme song to a show called Lie  to Me.  Yeah, on Fox.  I don't know if you've seen that yet.  Oh, okay.  Very cool.  Ryan Star.  You have a theme?  Lie to Me?  Lie to Me, man.  With Tim Roth.  Tim Roth.  Okay.  And they just won some of those, what are those with People, last week, People's Choice  Awards.  People's Choice Awards.  I was psyched to see that, yeah.  And this song is the, okay.  It's the theme song.  It's called Brandy Day.  Dream set me aside, turn back the clocks, give me some time. 
[03:16:00]  I've stayed in one place for too long, gotta get on the run again.  I saw the one thing that I want, hell-bent get out of bed.  I'm throwing rocks at your window, you're tying the bedsheets together.  They say that we're dreaming too big, but I say this town's too small. 
[03:16:30]  Dream set me aside, turn back the clocks, give me some time.  I need to break out, and make a new name.  Let's open our eyes, to the brand new day.  It's the brand new day. 
[03:17:00]  I've taken hits like a brawler, but I'm getting back up again.  And from the moment I saw her, I was hell-bent with heaven's sands.  I'm throwing rocks at your window, we're leaving this place together.  They say that we're flying too high, we'll get used to looking up.  Dream, send me a sign.  Turn back the clocks, give me some time. 
[03:17:30]  I need to break out, and make a new name.  Let's open our eyes, to the brand new day.  It's a brand new day.  Come on to the brand new day.  Yeah, I know it's a brand new day. 
[03:18:00]  Dream, send me a sign.  Turn back the clocks, give me some time.  Time, I need to break out, and make a new name.  Let's open our eyes, to the brand new day.  It's a brand new day.  It's a brand new day. 
[03:18:30]  Nah, nah.  Woo!  Ah, nah, nah.  Oh.  Damn, Iron Star.  Shit.  That's talent, because you're singing that to dudes.  I know.  So awkward for all of us.  How do you do that at, like, 10 in the morning, also?  Jesus Christ.  How do you show passion like that in front of dudes?  That's why he's fucking, he pays no attention to dudes.  Yeah, exactly.  He just closes his eyes. 
[03:19:00]  He just fucking does it.  I take the dudes seriously.  All weekend, I was ESPN, all the ESPN stuff.  They've been playing some of my tunes there, too.  Jesus Christ.  So you try to get the dudes, try to get the girls, and you try to get the grandmas.  It's the perfect equation.  No shit.  That's original shit there.  That's that's some Long Island shit you've been doing.  Okay?  That's fucking some real deal.  Long Island shit that I've been doing.  I don't know.  Whatever you do, you get on stage with your cowbell or whatever the fuck you do.  What the fuck do you do?  Okay, go fuck yourself.  Chris, this is a cold part.  I don't even know what you're talking about. 
[03:19:30]  That was real.  Why are you taking shots?  Because he's just, here's the thing.  And do you really hate me?  No, not at all.  I just got the best tweet out of all of them today.  Did you tweet me?  No, this guy.  Matt Ryan, start.  Come on.  This fucking guy, when a black dude was beating his kid, I go, his pants are down.  The guy goes, that's because his belt is off beating the kid.  Get it?  Anyhow, what I'm saying is, it was a good tweet.  It was a good tweet.  That's some crazy twitters.  Was that your tweet?  No, some guy sent it to me.  It was funny, though. 
[03:20:00]  Ryan Starr, what are you on Twitter?  It's at Ryan Starr.  It's Ryan Starr.  One R, by the way, S-T-A-R.  And so you should see the difference in my Twitters to his Twitters.  That's some crazy.  Even guys that are the nicest guys want to come in and fuck with me.  I'm telling them how great he is.  No, I'm not saying anything about you.  He's not.  I'm not saying those twitters.  You always think it's about you.  He's saying that his tweets are fucked.  He doesn't have shitty tweets.  He has people only do supportive tweets, is what he's saying. 
[03:20:30]  What I'm saying is, I love his music.  Foss feels like he's being burnt by a crack pipe all the time.  I'm so fucking numb, I can't even hear what people are saying.  No.  No, sit next to him for fucking three hours.  Fuck you, man.  You know what?  Yeah, he's Mr. Victim.  I'm not a victim.  Now on, you can only come in when he's here.  Because you guys haven't been together in a while.  We haven't been together.  Bobby is so much easier.  It was great right now.  All right, we've got to get out of here.  Rich, where are you going to be? 
[03:21:00]  I'm going to play another one from Ryan as we move.  I'll be in Rhode Island this weekend.  Catch us on Harrisburg next week in the Comedy Zone.  But more important, he'll be at Webster Hall, and you'll see some real good shit from him.  You're coming, right?  On my stomach.  Oh, my God.  I didn't even set that up.  You guys are the 2011 Abbott and Gunstall.  Hold on.  Stinky wants to say something.  Jesus Christ.  Oh, my God.  What comedian did you say he looks like? 
[03:21:30]  No, Stinky was the other one on Abbott.  Oh, I know.  I kind of like that line.  That's all.  Oh, good.  I get to believe I like the line.  Well, because I know I don't feel like getting a phone call from you later.  Oh, really?  I'll do it now.  No, that was really good when you did that.  Patrice knows.  No phone calls today.  You did great.  I'll say it live in front of everyone.  You did great.  You wasn't mad at me when I said that thing, when I said it, even though Obie had called  retarded for an hour and a half of the show.  You deserve what you did, bro. 
[03:22:00]  You deserve it.  You deserve it, man.  I'm on your side, dude.  I'm telling you.  I'm out of retirement now.  All right.  Patrice is out of retirement.  Because I'm going to fucking make it for Paul.  Patrice, are you promoting anything?  Big male prods?  I got February 19th.  My special comes out.  I was at the taping, and this thing's going to do really well, man.  I'm telling you.  And then you get the DVD out with all the other stuff.  The DVD comes right with 45 minutes of content, some extra this, some extra that.  And they're going to put my first special in there, too, as a little bonus.  That's pretty cool. 
[03:22:30]  The one they did, I did in, like, 2001.  You get a little taste of that?  A little bit?  A taste?  Nah, they bought me, like, a goddamn...  They bought me for pennies on the dollar, nigga.  They're going to make...  They're going to make money.  I hope so.  Listen, I'll trade in being able to fill up Albany fucking Philharmonic with their three  seats if I go to Albany.  I just want to get some people to come to see me if I'm going to Albany.  Yeah.  That's it.  So Comedy Central can keep the change, nigga.  As long as they fucking...  It's a promotion, yeah.  Do something.  You know what I'm saying?  So that's it. 
[03:23:00]  And, Ryan, you want me to just play the disc?  Yeah, man.  Can I get it easy for you today?  There's a new song, Start a Fire.  Start a Fire.  And how do they get this?  How do who get what?  I'm trying to promote you.  How do who get what?  Oh, the people.  The people.  My friends.  The fans.  It's on my album.  My album's called 1159.  It's on iTunes and stores now.  Right.  And I promise you, my man over here will give you a money-back guarantee if you don't  like it.  I promise you'll like the album.  All right, good.  Ryan Starr.  And Webster Hall, January 18th.  Fucking just blowing up right in front of our eyes. 
[03:23:30]  We'll play this and we'll see you guys tomorrow.  That was great shit, man.  That made me like music again.  Play the song, man.  I remember when you said your father is asleep.  I remember swimming as our clothes drifted off to the sea.  So wake up, wake up dreaming.  And lie here with me.  Wake up, wake up dreaming. 
[03:24:00]  And lie here with me.  Here we go.  Just lose control and let your body give in to the beat.  Your heart is mine and touches your skin.  It's just love.  Oh, just actual desire.  We're gonna start a fire.  I remember drinking as the stars were falling. 
[03:24:30]  I remember dancing on the hotels on me.  So wake up, he's all together.  And разные.  So wake up, wake up dreaming.  And lie here with me.  And lie here with me.  Wake up, wake up dreaming.  And lie here with me.  Here we go. 
[03:25:00]  Just lose control and let your body give in.  To the beat of your heart is mine and touches your skin.  If there's love, oh, just sexual desire  We gotta start a fire  Here we go, just lose control and let your body give in  To the beat of your heart as mine and touches your skin  If there's love, oh, just sexual desire  We gotta start a fire 
[03:25:30]  Taking chances in the back of your car  We burn, and all my radio is rocking in the frame  We're an SOS, so obsessed  Oh, you make me such a mess  Why can't this just last forever?  Why, why, why?  So wake up, wake up dreaming  And lie here with me  Here we go, just lose control and let your body give in
