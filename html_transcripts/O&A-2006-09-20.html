<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast covered a wide range of topics, often shifting abruptly between them.  The show began with Opie detailing a sore throat and the resulting chaotic search for medication in the studio, leading to a comparison of their perceived masculinity against Chuck Liddell and a boast from Kenny about defeating Jet Li. Anthony's recent purchase of a Mustang GT500 Shelby was a significant talking point, with anecdotes about enthusiastic fans and one incident involving unwanted touching of his car. This segued into a discussion about midlife crises and Anthony’s reasoning behind the purchase.

A substantial portion focused on outrage over explicit t-shirts sold at the San Gennaro Festival in Little Italy, juxtaposed against other potentially problematic aspects of the festival. A caller shared a negative experience with a rigged game at the festival.  The show also featured listener calls regarding discrepancies in reported versus actual listenership, a YouTube video showcasing the potentially offensive 1961 film "My Baby Is Black," and a news story about parents kidnapping their daughter to obtain an abortion due to the father’s race.  Musician Gary Hoey was a guest throughout the broadcast, providing musical interludes and promoting his Christmas album and guitar lessons. The recurring promotion of "Whip-Em-Out Wednesday" and "Wow Stickers" was also woven throughout.

The show further delved into missing ONA merchandise, leading to sarcastic banter.  A discussion about YouTube searches, contrasting "hot girls kissing" videos with videos of "kids fighting," especially those involving overweight children, transitioned into a broader commentary on the changing media landscape, comparing traditional television to YouTube’s accessibility and immediacy. This expanded into a critique of predictable storytelling in film and TV versus the unscripted nature of YouTube content.  A humorous segment involved an audio clip of a purported leprechaun sighting.  The hosts discussed a local news broadcast where the anchors' unscripted improvisation went awry, prompting ideas for a "Hall of Fame" for bad news improv.

A significant segment focused on promoting the Opie and Anthony live comedy show in Cleveland, addressing low ticket sales and attributing it to a scheduling conflict with the Jewish High Holy Days. A listener call led to accusations of Anthony stealing a joke from a former intern.  The show then moved into brainstorming a new radio contest, initially suggested as a "Fat Disgusting Pig Contest" involving overweight women in bikinis competing for prize money based on weight.  Extensive discussion covered contest rules, prize money, sponsorships, and potential visual elements, along with listener reactions, including complaints. The segment concluded with further promotion and playful jabs at Howard Stern's perceived envy of their success.

Another large portion of the show centered on Howard Stern's advertising strategies throughout his career, contrasting his past aggressive marketing with a perceived current lack of advertising for his SiriusXM show.  A humorous anecdote involved a 1980s TV commercial featuring a priest reacting to Stern's firings and hirings. The hosts jokingly credited Stern with boosting cell phone popularity through his endorsements. This transitioned into further discussion and development of the "Fat Girl Contest," which paid contestants $10 or more per pound.  The show took calls from potential contestants, live on air developing contest rules and brainstorming various – often offensive – contest names.  The rules were finalized, including categories for heaviest contestant, most weight gained, and a talent portion, with Halloween as the final date.  The hosts also discussed using masks for anonymity.

A caller, Andrew, described a severe leg infection, prompting further discussion of his physical state.  There were also detailed descriptions of crude jokes and comments about passersby during their "walkover" commute.  The show included a promotional appearance by Gary Hoey, and there was also a humorous anecdote about Imus giving an ONA t-shirt to an MSNBC reporter.

The show introduced another contest, "Foaming Pussy," involving a handstand and a Diet Coke and Mentos geyser from a woman's vagina, sparking extensive discussion, sexually explicit jokes, and safety concerns.  A caller described a YouTube video of a similar experiment, done in the mouth. The "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest was also discussed. The segment featured a chaotic and profane interview with musician Blowfly and a lengthy call with Marilyn discussing her weight, relationships, and thoughts on the contests.  The hosts consumed soup on air and engaged in further sexually charged banter.  Gary Hoey performed live.  Blowfly and Jim Norton were present in the studio along with Opie and Anthony and Gary Hoey.


Finally, a segment focused on a "Line of the Day" contest judged by the hosts, with callers providing often offensive and humorous entries.  The "Fatty Pig Fatty" contest was again promoted, along with crude and sexually explicit humor involving discussions about prostitution, body shaming, graphic descriptions of bodily functions, and sexual acts.  A trucker caller revealed he hauls sausage casings, further fueling the vulgar banter. The show discussed a Domino's pizza commercial and a listener’s comment about the benefits of being "white and insured." Gary Hoey performed multiple times, and the segment ended with more crude humor and sound effects.

[00:05:30]  taking a boner pill  in the middle of this mess  tom walks in you stand up  yeah right  you look like mark chernoff  he's always got a print showing  i can't get over it  that's all i look at when he walks in  i noticed that one time  i think it was sometime in like uh  you know april 8th  i just can't stop every time he walks in  can't stop looking  oh just those slacks  i feel fine though  i'm just clogged  and i got the sore throat so  but i'm ready to broadcast  i need to rock  talk it out  oh yeah  that's what you gotta do 
[00:06:00]  talk it out  i was thinking about uh  chuck liddell  yesterday on the way home  yeah i listened to the replay  and i realized that  badass  we're not even in the in the man category  no he's like a man  we are some kind of hybrid  uh in between a woman and man  you'd like to think you're a tough man  nah  and then someone like that comes along  and what would you do  you'd do nothing  like i've been in my confrontations over the years  and i got my  i've i've had my ass kicked  and i've kicked other people's asses 
[00:06:30]  and i i pretty much don't back down  and i was thinking  i was looking at him yesterday going  god if this guy started something with you  what would you do  would you just crawl into a ball  and just start crying uncontrollably  and hope that  that some kind of  some kind of human emotion  would take over his brain  and and he realizes  you're just such a little baby  that he would leave you alone  it's a no-win scenario  you you would go into it  and there's no way to win  you'd either have to just run away as fast as you  you think he could uh 
[00:07:00]  catch you running  oh yeah  oh yeah  damn it  an athlete  you can't even run away from him  no he's an animal  somebody told me  toddlin i saw last night  the seller said he saw him working out  he said it was in south africa  uh  and he said that he saw chuck running  i don't know if that's true or not  but he was running up  uh the side of a mountain  with some type of heavy bag  he was carrying  beating up a zebra  with weights and stuff  well i don't like that attack  on couples who make different choices  than we do  um  you know it's kind of like a  50 or 60 pound heavy bag on his back 
[00:07:30]  it's probably  up a hill  yeah  you just realize you're not in the same category  he's in his own category  that guy  even our own kenny is all man  but compared to chuck  he's got a little bit of bitch in him  you know  like compared to chuck  and you're all man  right  well we had the conversation  down uh  in the elevator  downstairs yesterday  after this part of the show  and kenny basically admitted  that he could kick jet lee's ass  he says jet lee  no problem  because it's all like um  movie moves 
[00:08:00]  like he stopped fighting years ago  yeah  so it's all choreographed moves  that's  but that's a bold statement  oh no  kenny said it  it's still a bold statement  kenny said he would have  no problem with jet lee  yeah i respect everything he's done  but i i wouldn't think twice  of fighting him  chuck liddell  i i i would uh worry about  and kenny admitted that  yeah chuck liddell  would kill him  but they're in the same  they're both  kenny at least is in the same  category of man as chuck  chuck's just uh  constantly trained  and better trained  but at least kenny is  in that realm 
[00:08:30]  where chuck would  would definitely  think twice about  fighting kenny  if he knew kenny  he would he'd do it  but he would go  all right well  this is a guy that could  hurt me if i make a misstep  if he hit kenny in the face  kenny's hair would blow off  like when you blow on a dandelion  because it's so dry  yeah  metallic shavings  you have a head full of  metallic shavings  just what i thought  like lathe scrapings  just what i thought  we didn't have any more  dry hair jokes  no there's plenty of them  there comes the best one yet  they'll never stop  i was listening to the replay  with something we get uh 
[00:09:00]  we get uh with the xm show  for the new people out there  and uh  club soda kenny  as a serial killer was  yes  oh my god  serial killer kenny  oh my god  was that funny  you're a fun guy ken  i'm great fodder  for the show  yeah  and you also do  very good work  i try  yeah  all right let's say  hi to chad in wisconsin  chad what's up  chad  hey chad  hey boys  i just wanted to say  that kicking ass  and throwing poker chips 
[00:09:30]  at a chick  do not count  as kicking ass  obie  yeah obie  do you consider  when you threw the poker chips  at that poor crying woman  in our studio  was that  one of your conquests  one of your ass kickings  you threw somebody  no that's  no  that's just me being  an ass  that video's up on youtube  by the way  yeah  throw opie and anthony in the search  huh  and what about getting the mirror  ripped off of your jeep  something about that  all right  that was uh  a couple of um 
[00:10:00]  that was a holy ass moment  yeah  that was a  oh my god  i just want to move the car forward  as soon as possible  i'm not a fighter  i'm a lover  and then of course  there was the underwater frenchman  and well  yeah the fight underwater  so  all right  so maybe i haven't really  got into a real fight yet  haven't been kicking ass  in a while  it's been a few years  so uh  you gotta tell jimmy  about the car yesterday  the car experience  oh when i was out driving  yeah anthony's going 
[00:10:30]  through a midlife crisis  i know  and uh  it's not a midlife crisis  it's i'm at the point in my life  where i can afford a couple of  of the finer things in life  and i am enjoying  just that  i'm not being irresponsible  i'm not being uh mc hammer  you know  but uh  if i see something  i might make a purchase  well define a midlife crisis  a midlife crisis  because actually you did  i'm trying to bust on you  but you did make a great point  when we brought up  the midlife crisis thing last week  i went through my midlife crisis  uh 
[00:11:00]  years ago  when i got divorced  that was when i went through it  pick up my little chippy  that was my midlife crisis  i looked around  and went  what the hell am i doing  midlife crisis  when you're married  for the most part  you're  you gotta be married  to really  have one of those  not necessarily  but it helps  uh  kids  um  every penny you make  working  has to go toward  the family  paying for school  and things like that  and the wife  doing things  taking care of the house 
[00:11:30]  you drive something  you really  aren't proud of  maybe a minivan  things like that  but you're still  a man inside  somewhere down there  in that emasculated mess  is a man  and you want to do  manly things  uh  which include  um  having sex  with younger women  and driving fast cars  it seems to be  that seems to be  like what a midlife crisis is  so these guys  that's it though  young chicks  they might pop  an earring in  they might pop 
[00:12:00]  an earring in  grow their hair  a little longer  wear clothes  that are a little  too young  for what they  should be wearing  things like that  you're a midlife  code red  I am not  you have the clothes  the young chick  the sports cars  and the video games  video games  I've been playing  since 1980  I understand  you're a midlife  Anthony  I had a midlife  crisis at like  12  yeah there's a  there's a million  guys listening to you  that are the exact  same age as you  and they started  playing video games  in 1980  the problem  they stopped

[00:23:30]  It's a great promotion.  Starting to see a lot more Wow Stickers around the New York area, by the way.  Free FM here in New York City doing a great job with getting the stickers to the people.  Indeed.  If the station you're listening to us on doesn't have a Wow Sticker campaign, burn it down.  Because I don't know.  I've lost track as far as what stations are supporting the Wow and what other stations are just letting us do all the heavy lifting.  You can just throw a Wow sign on your car. 
[00:24:00]  It stands for Whip Them Out Wednesday.  Girls see the Wow in your car and they will flash you.  Yeah.  It's been happening for many, many years.  There's plenty of women out there that are willing to do this.  They're just waiting to see a Wow Sticker.  Trust me on that.  And it's happening all the time.  We like to celebrate on Wednesdays, but basically it's Whip Them Out whenever at this point.  Whenever.  You just throw it on there.  You drive around.  It might happen that day.  It might happen in a month. 
[00:24:30]  It's like fishing.  You've got to wait for it.  But then it happens.  There you go.  You're all surprised and happy.  Let's see what Cleveland's up to this morning.  Heather, what's up?  Hey, how you guys doing?  Hey, Heather.  I just wanted to.  You know, I've been trying to call you guys since you guys first came to Cleveland years and years ago.  Ooh.  Call finally got through.  Yeah.  I want to thank Lil Divi there for giving up those $10 tickets.  Oh, you're welcome.  You know, I had to.  Oh, go ahead.  It was a brainstorm I came up with.  I had to. 
[00:25:00]  Oh, all right.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  I didn't mean to actually have more than one sentence to say.  You have to understand sometimes there's a difference between a period and a semicolon in spoken word.  But go right ahead.  You plow right through.  Obviously, what you have is pressing.  What I have is garbage.  Go ahead.  No, no.  No, I didn't mean to interrupt for the conversational thought.  No, I had a lot of friends that I wanted to take with me, and a lot of them are kind of down out with the money deal these days.  So, I was like, okay.  I was at work, and me and my sister would get the tickets off the internet for me.  So, you have some props to her. 
[00:25:30]  What time was it at work?  I mean, if you're going to give out details, we might as well give them out all.  Get them all.  Every detail.  Get them all in.  The details?  What time?  I'm glad you're coming.  I'm sure it's going to be an amazing show with people like yourself in the audience.  So, you got a bunch of your like-minded friends to come?  Oh, yeah, I do.  Did you?  Can you cancel my flight?  I had a bunch of them.  Cool.  Wow, you waited a long time to get a hold of us.  Now, that's funny.  Yeah, it was yours.  I was probably like 23 when you guys first came on in Cleveland. 
[00:26:00]  Yeah.  All right, Heather.  We'll see you at the show Saturday.  Okay.  Imus is wearing an Opie and Anthony shirt.  Yeah.  He's a great supporter of this program.  We like Don Imus a lot.  And he is talking with Bill Donahue, the president of the Catholic League.  I'd love to hear that audio.  I bet Donahue is slamming Islam.  I hope so.  So do I.  Yeah.  I'm sure he is.  Wow, really going out on a limb there.  I bet Donahue is slamming Islam.  I don't like the fact that Pope looks like Pee Wee Herman. 
[00:26:30]  He has a really creepy face.  He has a creepy...  Bless you.  He has a creepy face.  He really does.  All the Popes do.  Ah, the last one.  The Pope's never known as really a good-looking guy, is he?  Yeah, but this guy is ghoulish.  Doesn't have to get the chicks.  He's very ghoulish.  The last Pope didn't look ghoulish.  Looks better with his glasses.  By the way, as a Yankee fan, I stopped watching him after my thing with Jeter this year. 
[00:27:00]  I stopped completely.  Yeah, I know.  And the Yankee I disliked the most was Giambi, and he is now my favorite Yankee.  Really?  I love him.  You're fickle.  I am fickle.  You're a fickle boy.  But I met him once.  He was the nicest out of all of them, and he's smashing A-Rod in the paper.  Oh, he is?  Yes.  Oh, see.  He passed by the steroid thing, and he's obviously doing very well now.  We don't need any dissension in the ranks.  A-Rod stinks.  Let's go, Mets go.  I wish I had a crickets button for that saying.  I hate the Mets go. 
[00:27:30]  Let's go, Mets.  250,000 people trying to get playoff tickets.  They're saying in the paper today.  And your Yankees aren't in it yet.  What's that?  The Satan.  How about this?  Go Tigers.  How about that?  You are really out there.  You're local.  I like it.  We're not being heard on an FM in Detroit.  You've got to make it sound local.  A-Rod is a baby.  And I like the fact that Jason just smashed him.  I never wanted this dope.  I want Alfonso Soriano and his stupid big teeth. 
[00:28:00]  Like the guy that got his head caved in in Platoon.  That's what Alfonso Soriano's smile looked like.  Kevin Dillon should be cracking his skull open with a rifle butt.  I want him back.  Young kid with high socks.  Hey, the San Gennaro feast is going on in Little Italy.  And every year there's a huge controversy over the T-shirts that they sell.  Yeah.  Why?  Didn't we do this story last year?  Every year they have this story like it just – it's the first year it happened. 
[00:28:30]  Well, San Gennaro, the big Italian feast down there in Little Italy.  Italy.  Here in New York City.  There are other places that have them, though.  And they sell all – they're hawking all kinds of wares down there.  They're just all the I love New York garbage, tourist, you know, tourist crap.  And they're upset because, you know, the logo, the slogan, the little print, I heart New York.  It's the I love New York thing. 
[00:29:00]  Well, there's T-shirts that say, I heart sluts.  And that's one of the clean ones.  There are some other ones.  You know, vagina is on there.  Penis is on the shirt.  There are just a couple of things that are getting people upset.  And, again, it's like, who cares?  Who cares?  And they have to bring up the children.  Some people just couldn't believe it was all happening right here at the San Gennaro Festival. 
[00:29:30]  People couldn't believe it was happening right here at the San Gennaro Festival?  People couldn't believe it.  Are you kidding me?  How about I can't believe I'm being shaken down by a guy that's giving me darts to pop balloons,  and it cost me 50 bucks, and he told me, go ahead, throw another one.  It's on the house.  How about when that happened to me?  Why aren't they looking into that?  Why isn't the brave news looking into some of the booths, some of the gaming booths over at San Gennaro?  What are you saying?  I'm not saying anything.  I'm just saying that some of these games, though very entertaining, 
[00:30:00]  can perhaps get a little more expensive than you first anticipated.  Wait, is it on the house, though, when they say it's on the house?  Well, they confuse you.  Look, all I know is I was pretty proficient at darts.  Like I said before, I've been on dart leagues back in the day when I used to frequent a lot of the bars.  I was on a bar dart league and pretty good at the darts.  So I figured, I'm at San Gennaro.  Let me throw a few of these curved darts.  The darts, they bend so it curves a little bit.  But, you know, figure it out. 
[00:30:30]  You play the curve.  You play the curve.  You play the curve.  Everyone knows you've got to play the curve.  But, you know, you stand there and the guy, as you're walking by, the guy goes,  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, take a shot, take a shot.  You go, what?  Take a shot here.  And he hands you a dart.  And you go, this one's on me.  Let's see how you do.  Let's just see how you do.  I go, all right.  I grab it.  I can throw a free dart.  He's offering one.  I throw it.  He goes, come on, take another one.  Hey, come on.  He gives me another dart.  So I grab another one. 
[00:31:00]  Throw it.  He goes, look, I know you can hit it.  So he gives me that third dart.  He goes, come on.  Just give it a try.  I'm like, all right.  I'm still under the impression that it was a free one.  Yeah, he's giving me a free round there just to see.  So I go, ah.  And I start to walk away.  Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.  Ten bucks.  It's like, what?  It was three darts.  Ten bucks.  I go, you said, but you said, no, no, no, no.  Three bucks. 
[00:31:30]  Come on, come on, come on, come on.  And everything's real fast after that.  And he's talking loud.  And I'm pulling money out of my pocket.  Because there's a big guy there, too.  I would have said, I'd like to see your permit, sir.  Where are your credentials?  I'm calling the authority.  Yeah, you don't want to see his permit.  Yeah, it looks like a fist.  And he comes at you really quickly.  That's the lucky permit if you get that one.  Usually you get the one that's strapped to his ankle.  I would have raised a stink. 
[00:32:00]  Yes, you would have.  After you're dead in a dumpster.  I would have asked for his manager.  Well, they're worried about t-shirts down there.  I speak to your manager, sir.  And not the boots.  Some people just couldn't believe it was all happening right here at the San Gennaro Festival.  Now, we should warn you, some of the images you're about to see could be graphic.  No, they're not.  It's a celebration.  That is graphic.  I had a white suit and he shot through a towel.  The city's annual salute to the patron saint of Naples.  It is very, very religious. 
[00:32:30]  So we were a little stunned to see this vendor right at the entrance.  Just below Cookie Monster selling stuff like this.  And t-shirts so explicit we can't even show you them on TV.  Yeah, they said, she just said, you know, warning, it's going to be some explicit content.  And they blurred out everything.  So they don't give us the explicit content.  There's no explicit content.  You know why they said that?  Because everyone wants to see explicit content.  You want to see explicit content.  Right. 
[00:33:00]  That reminds me, I was listening to the replay yesterday and we were listening to, what's  his face there from the Dateline?  Yeah, Chris Hansen.  Chris Hansen.  We had him on XM yesterday talking about his pedophile exposés that he does, where he  has the house with the pedophile that comes over and confronts him with the camera.  And it is pure entertainment.  There is, they know it is.  And that's why they're trying to titillate by saying, warning, these images you're going 
[00:33:30]  to see is to keep people watching.  And I was saying, why are they doing umpteen hundred specials on this one subject?  Why doesn't Chris Hansen do an exposé on shoplifting?  Why don't they do 20 of those?  You know, you can do one.  I've seen them on TV.  They do some on shoplifting or one of those crimes.  You know, it's a crime.  It's something.  Why is that subject of guys trolling the internet for young girls and then getting arrested 
[00:34:00]  and busted?  Why is that worth 20 different shows?  And it's the titillation.  It's also the fact, though, that people are more interested in seeing that, A, because  it's so serious and it shows how it can reach into your home.  Whereas shoplifting, it's just kind of an it's just been happening and it hasn't changed  much except maybe getting a little bit easier or harder with the tags they put on.  But pedophilia is a bit more serious.  How about some other than serious crime that they can do a sting operation on that does  affect you and your home? 
[00:34:30]  The unlicensed Asians who are doing caricatures on Broadway.  All right.  Let me get the camera rolling on that one.  I'll let them execute it.  They never look like the person.  No one's admitting this.  They always make the nose too big.  In the head, like everyone's got Down syndrome all of a sudden.  Horrible.  Thanks a million.  On a little.  Where am I going to hang this piece of crap?  On a little caricature body too.  It's like, how can I play professional ball for the Yankees with a head that big?  Right.  They put you on a little like Yankee body. 
[00:35:00]  Oh, swing and the bat.  Swing and the bat.  Number six.  With a big giant head.  Or they'll have you play in tennis.  Look at me.  I'm at the U.S. Open with a head as big as a dirigible.  What they should have you do is running through a finish line with your arms over your head  and your big fat tongue hanging out with a medal around your neck and your proud slashed terribly  ashamed parents are waiting for you.  Back to the bad t-shirts. 
[00:35:30]  Explicit.  We can't even show you them on TV.  I'm Andrea Day from Fox 5 News.  I just wanted to talk to you about your t-shirts.  The guy running the booth told us he already got complaints, so he's taking them down.  Why did you put them up in the first place?  They sell.  People like them.  Everyone laughs.  You know what that guy's going to do?  The news bitch is going to walk away and he's going to put his t-shirts right back out.  He knows how to cover up.  She's another one of these do-gooders.  She stinks, but I actually do think the t-shirts are inappropriate to be sold there. 
[00:36:00]  I do.  What?  Have you been down there?  Grandpa.  I'm only saying that sometimes, you know, it's like, eh, at a festival like that, it  is kind of a public place.  You've got to kind of use common sense.  I'm not saying they shouldn't be sold, but right there hanging at the front entrance,  I can see why people would be annoyed.  That's something you're kind of not inviting, that type of...  But all it says is, I love sluts.  Who cares?  That's not bad, but, you know, some of the other ones...  I want to see the other ones.  I don't know what the other ones are.  Let me tell you something.  It's people bringing their kids, maybe, and... 
[00:36:30]  Not a lot of kids.  That seems to be the concern.  Well, that's what they...  A lot of dates.  They concern.  That's their concern.  A lot of people just doing a little date night.  Date night.  Yeah.  But you walk around New York City, you're going to see a lot worse than that.  Yeah.  The human garbage in the street.  Things like that.  It's...  This is nothing.  It's a t-shirt.  I still want to talk about the booths and how booths are given out at the San Gennaro Fest.  I want to know what the voting system is. 
[00:37:00]  You really want to know?  Wow, look at the time.  You don't really want to know about that, do you?  Jimmy Norton wants to know that.  I'm going...  I'm going to call my councilman.  I'm going to call John Liu.  Why doesn't Andrea Day take on that?  Exactly.  Why doesn't she start poking around with some of the other things going on?  He asked for his manager, but he was under indictment.  I want to know where that tower of money really goes.  They walked the street.  What is it? 
[00:37:30]  It's just dollar bills.  Oh, yeah.  That thing.  Taped to the saint.  Thousands and thousands of bills.  Yeah.  Taped to some kind of saint that we don't know about.  Where's that money going?  Why don't you find that out, Andrea?  Keep asking those questions, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Find another caddy underneath an overpass full of holes.  I love this car.  Here's the second half of the story.  But we couldn't find many parents taking it lightly.  That's so technical.  I think it's a disgrace.  I don't think it's a joke. 
[00:38:00]  I think it gives the wrong impression for this whole festival.  Shut up.  And this vendor isn't alone.  Check out the t-shirt just inches away from that little girl.  That's very inappropriate.  I think this is a family affair.  The vendor at the first booth did wind up taking some t-shirts down,  but decided to leave this one up along with a few others.  I love sluts.  What about the kids who come to the festival and can see them?  Very few children come to the festival.  And, of course, that just simply isn't the case.  There are plenty of children here every day throughout the festival. 
[00:38:30]  The organizers tell us anything that is considered offensive will be taken down.  Oh, well, you got something done, didn't you?  They went to the organizers.  I want to get a t-shirt made.  Simple as this.  It says, I took a boner pill.  Oh.  And then everyone would look at the shirt and then look down.  They really would look down.  I want to walk around Manhattan with a t-shirt that just says,  I took a boner pill.  With one of those goofy glasses cameras so you could watch people's faces 
[00:39:00]  to see if they read your shirt and then look down.  But then on your pants you have a little sign.  It says, I was kidding, faggot.  What are you looking at?  All right, well, who cares?  Jimmy really cares?  Do you really care about the dumb t-shirts?  I don't care.  He thinks it's inappropriate.  Yeah, but there's a time and place for all that stuff.  You know, I don't know.  Perhaps the San Gennaro is anything goes there. 
[00:39:30]  I'm not saying it.  Because when you look at the bottom line, I don't think the shirts are really that big a deal.  Probably not.  I mean, what do you mean?  I'm just saying.  When you look at the San Gennaro Festival as a whole.  And religion.  Right.  And you look at it and, you know, who's putting it on, where it is.  Church?  Things like that.  Well, sure.  And where it is.  Where is it?  Little Italy.  Oh, nice.  Probably like a lot of Italian festival food. 
[00:40:00]  Exactly.  Right.  I don't think the shirts on the streets are the things maybe the news should be paying attention to if they were so brave.  What do you mean?  What do you think?  I just think there are maybe other things going on.  You really should use your imagination at this point, Jimmy.  Like the dark booth.  I'll just bring up my personal experience.  The dark booth.  Are you saying they should be measuring darts for straightness?  Why not?  Did you just say the dark booth?  You ain't going to find that.  Not there. 
[00:40:30]  Not at the San Gennaro.  All right.  We got to take a break.  That was probably what they were blurring out.  Really fast.  Let's say hi to.  Shirts with the N-word all over.  Yeah.  Those are the ones they want to sell.  I love strange fruit.  Hey, come on, huh?  Trust me.  They're already censoring themselves down there.  You know?  They have to sell something.  Yeah.  Ah, Bob in Chicago.  Pauly Walnuts commercial.  Hey, look at that.  For Netflix.  Hey, guys. 
[00:41:00]  What's going on?  Hey, you're listening to us on WCKG?  No.  Listening on XM.  I got to tell you, those ratings are completely wrong.  You know?  Used to listen to CKG all the time, but once I got XM about eight months ago, listening to  you guys all the time.  Oh, boy.  Jimmy, you're a doll.  All right.  Here's the problem, Bob.  Here's the problem.  Thank you very much, Bob.  The problem is we still have a 0.0 rating in Chicago.  Mr. Blutowski.  0.0.  And we know people are listening.  Oh, shit. 
[00:41:30]  Why don't you tell the ratings?  And put on CKG, and then you have a 1.00.1.  There you go.  That was worth interrupting me.  Thanks, Bob.  Ah, Jim in Pennsylvania.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  I love to show you a list to an XM all night long.  And for your new listeners, you guys got to play that leprechaun in the tree.  Oh, the leprechaun in the tree?  Do we have that really fast to play in a break?  Oh, that's hilarious.  But that's racially insensitive.  Hilarious.  Hilarious.  Well, yeah, there was – we got a news report of a leprechaun in a tree down there in Alabama. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And the news took it very seriously, and they interviewed the locals about this leprechaun people were seeing in a tree.  Oh, my God.  I just read the greatest thing I've ever read in my life.  What, what, what, Jimmy?  There was a story in New York – we didn't get to it yesterday – about two parents that had kidnapped their daughter.  She was 19.  She got pregnant.  Oh, yeah.  And they kidnapped her in Vermont or wherever it was, tied her up and threw her in the car to bring her here for an abortion. 
[00:42:30]  And, yeah, the twist – the twist to the story came out.  A Maine couple accused of tying up their 19-year-old daughter, throwing her in the car, and driving toward New York to get an abortion were upset because the baby's father is black.  Maine authority said yesterday.  Oh, I'd love to hear that conversation in the drive up or down.  Caitlin Kent, who is white, told Cumberland County Sheriff that her mother was pretty irate at the fact the child's father was black. 
[00:43:00]  She escaped at a shopping center, and they arrested her parents.  The boyfriend, Remy Johnson, 22, last week began serving a six-month sentence for theft.  Is that a great – now, why don't they make a sitcom based on that?  They should just call it Parents of the Year.  That guy wasn't taking any guff.  Absolutely not.  That's not called bad parenting.  That's called Crime Stoppers. 
[00:43:30]  His little girl.  All right, look, we're going – you're carrying a what?  Let's have it removed immediately.  Dear, get the duct tape.  We're driving to New York.  I'm going to have to kiss a what every Christmas?  You expect me to sing happy birthday to a what? 
[00:44:00]  I shan't be the grandfather of a –  Take your – child away.  Do we have a hanger?  Or do I have to drive to New York to get rid of that?  Do you know how bad you have to want to give your kid an abortion when you not only duct tape her, but you know you have a three-hour drive, and there's going to be one, like, should we take the easy pass lanes or the toll lanes? 
[00:44:30]  Yeah, yeah, sure, I bet.  What are you speaking?  Sir, what's the matter?  There's a girl tied up.  You don't understand what she has growing in her belly.  We're doing her a favor. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah, that is a little bit of intolerance there, huh?  A little intolerance.  An interesting twist to the story.  It says, of course, she's doing six months for theft.  Now the leprechaun story is going to have to wait until after the break.  Ties in nicely.  It's some great audio, but it will have to wait.  Gary Hoey, play us out for a little while.

Wait wait wait wait  Look almost an up skirt 
[00:59:30]  Exactly  Shot  Alright the girls  They're kissing very  Very  Very tenderly  It's very sexy  I think that's hot  But I have a problem  Because it's very obviously  Professional  Exactly  Why would I  I want the teenage girls kissing  Yeah of course  And then you know  There's something very hot about  Because you get to use  Your imagination  Very well produced  Nothing wrong with  Using your imagination  Nice cinematography  Yeah no that's  Those are two professionals  I want the amateur  Two you know  High school teenage girls  Make it out

[01:01:30]  On YouTube  Too funny man  Well fat kids kissing  A couple of videos are coming up  But kiss the fat kid  Alright whatever  You know you just don't know  What the hell  The future's gonna bring  We've talked about this  In the past  Everyone's impression  Of the future  Was so much different  Than it turned out  You thought by 2006  We'd talk about  The flying cars  We'd have moon bases  Things like that  Everything is pretty much  The same as it was  But we have access 
[01:02:00]  Instant access  To all these videos  And audio  And stuff  That just  Anything you wanna see  Anything you wanna see  Is available  Regular TV is just  Missing the boat  They really can't  Do anything about it  They're too regulated  But they don't understand  How powerful  YouTube is getting  Jay Leno sort of  Gets it  Because I saw a video  Of Jay Leno  Doing the best of YouTube  The other night  Where he's  He's finding the best  Videos you can find  On YouTube  And doing a little  Segment on his show  Patrice was doing 
[01:02:30]  The web junk  Though for a while  So he's embracing YouTube  You know  When you watch  Regular TV  It just feels  So old now  It just feels  So old  Cable's not regulated  And they're just dummies  They're just dummies  Yeah I know  Well they're doing that  For advertisers  Yeah  They you know  Like comedy  FX  FX does  Plays Rescue Me  And they curse  They use everything  But the F word  Everything  And they got advertisers  Because they're 
[01:03:00]  A successful show  Comedy Central  On the other hand  Won't use certain language  Till you know  Late at night  I don't  They don't use certain language  And they're politically correct  Which bugs me  Yeah  The fact that they're  Political agenda  Really bugs me  So come on guys  You're a common network  But these things  Like YouTube  They're quick snippets  So you're not  You don't have to  Devote a half hour  Of what you're doing  To be entertained  You know  You got a few minutes  You click on a few videos  You're entertained  You walk away  People's attention spans  Are really 
[01:03:30]  You just have to sit down  And watch a show  DVR  There's no fast forwarding  You know  You just have to sit there  And watch their show  People's attention spans  Are really getting  A little  Little thin  Because we've gotten  Such garbage  For so long  You're so sick and tired  In every movie  You see  Of a cheesy story  Having to be built  That really  Built for the sake  Of structure  And there's nothing to it  You're getting sick and tired  Of the predictable  Romances in films  You just want the good parts  It's all crap  The predictable endings 
[01:04:00]  All that  Just give us  The good parts  Just give us the good parts  Hot girls kissing  And fat kids fighting  Fat kids fighting  And I'll take a good slow movie  Like Capote  I thought was great  I don't  It doesn't have to be all  Action for me  Action packed  But stop with the same  Predictable garbage  The same cheesy  I'll see you in hell  Did you see The Illusionist?  It's my favorite line  No  Did you see The Illusionist?  How is it?  Edward Norton's new film?  No, I'll just see that  I saw it the other night  Terrific film  Oh good  Is it really?  It was really, really good 
[01:04:30]  I hear it's stunningly  Beautifully filmed  It was filmed differently  Yeah  Is it out of theaters now?  Yeah  I guess  I don't know  I get my free copies  I want a copy  I mean I'm going to go see it  From Asian people  Oh  I'm just kidding  Oh I'm just kidding  Oh  Hey we got to play the leprechaun  Hi  We promised this before the break  Someone suggested this  For the new listeners  I think a leprechaun story  Would sound a little different  Than this one does  No kidding  This is one of our favorite audios 
[01:05:00]  Audio pieces  It's a new  They got word that there was a leprechaun  Hanging out in a tree  The locals have been seeing this leprechaun in a tree  Send the news  So they did a whole news piece on the leprechaun in the tree  Check this out as we go to break  Curiosity leads to large crowds in Mobile's Crichton community  Many of you bring binoculars, camcorders, even camera phones to take pictures  To me it looked like a leprechaun to me  I got to do a little bit of a tree  Who else in the leprechaun say yeah? 
[01:05:30]  Yeah  Eyewitnesses say the leprechaun only comes out at night  If you shine a light in its direction it suddenly disappears  This amateur sketch resembles what many of you say the leprechaun looks like  Others find it hard to believe and have come up with their own theories and explanations for the image  My theory is it's casting a shadow from the other limb  Could be a crackhead that got home to the wrong stuff 
[01:06:00]  And it told him to get up in a tree and play a leprechaun  We're gonna get down to the bottom of this  Yeah, still down there, guy, don't be afraid  Don't be afraid, man  This guy helping to direct traffic says he's prepared for his encounter with the leprechaun  He's suited up from head to toe  This waters all smells right here  This is a special leprechaun flute  Which has been passed down from thousands of years ago  From my great-great-grandfather who was Irish  I just came to help out  Others just came to get lucky in hopes a pot of gold may be buried under this tree 
[01:06:30]  I'm gonna run a backhoe and uproot that tree  I wanna know where to go  I want the gold  Give me the gold  I want the gold  It's Whip'em Out Wednesday  It's not nude, it's just girls flashing guys that have W-O-W on their vehicle somewhere  That's the WOW campaign  Wow  For details on how to get your very own WOW sticker, go to opieandemony.com  Look at that WOW, it's still happening  Oh, it's the WOW

Well, this one has two  I just got my new iPod Nano! 
[01:08:30]  That was three  Now you're cheating  This thing is AMAZING!  Just when I thought the iPod  Couldn't get any smaller or lighter  Apple has done it again  The iPod Nano has been completely remastered  It has a thinner design  It comes in five stylish colors  Black, silver, blue, green, and pink  Let the iPod Nano defend your style  Listen to this  The new iPod Nano has a better life of up to 24 hours  Now it will last longer than you do!  There's a lot of exclamation points 
[01:09:00]  Exclamation points stink  Do you use them at all?  Never  What if you want to  Unless a girl says to me  Um, I knew we should have used a condom  I missed my period  I think I may be pregnant  When I write  Oh, just die already  I put exclamation points in my response  Okay  That's a good place to put them  I used to love the exclamation points  Until Jimmy did this bit  I've used them less  And now I don't use them anymore 
[01:09:30]  Now I've used them less  I was really abusing them  Yeah  I think we all do  Sometimes I would use three  Hey  We got, uh, uh  Stupid newscaster banter  Improv  If you will  Oh, we love  Danny just handed this in  And I don't know  He doesn't want to ruin it for us  He said just play it  Okay  When they go off the teleprompter  The news people  They're good  Um, they lose everything  They can't get back on track  They don't know how to talk to each other  As human beings  It is, uh, it's cringe-inducing 
[01:10:00]  And it's very hard for them  To get back to the story  And if this is happening in your city  Please send it in to the radio show  We love it  All right  Let's listen in on this one  So that's what's happening  But the big story is traffic, Pat  You know, and every time  I think of the Waller of Astoria  And I think of world leaders  I think of coming to America  Uh, when, uh, James Earl Jones  Came to see  To find Eddie Murphy  And he's like  Where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waller of Astoria  And that's where I guess 
[01:10:30]  The president's guess  So where else  Oh my God  Oh, oh, oh boy  Oh boy  I gotta back up  Who is that, by the way?  Does anyone remember laughter?  I don't know  Oh, is it?

Where are we going to do the show from? 
[01:20:00]  I guess they have another studio  And we're going to do our show  And then they're going to broadcast it later in the day in Cleveland  So we've got to go into this tiny little studio  Yeah, I guess  Oh, this is going to stink  And do a show?  Yeah, yeah, yeah  This is going to stink  Yeah  So, you know, hopefully we'll get some listeners down to the station  I don't know how they're promoting it in Cleveland  Hopefully they're doing the right thing  Yes, Steve  It's actually, we're not in a smaller studio  We're in the main studio  And the morning show is in Best Of that day  Ah, ah, ah  Very nice 
[01:20:30]  All right  Okay  The show is Saturday at Tower City Empatheter in Cleveland  Tickets are only $10 because of what?  Because the whole economy is collapsing in Cleveland?  That's what Pete came up with?  It's a Jewish high holy day  That's right  For the love of God  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations  Presented by Bud Light  Always worth it  Are these good, Kenny?  Yeah, I do the Centrum  Do you?  Yeah, I do  I never take vitamins  All vitamins are the same  Why are there two things of vitamins? 
[01:21:00]  So they can  So they can charge you more money  I realize that one thing  I'm tired a lot  I mean, I have a bad schedule  But I think maybe I don't get enough vitamins  So I'm going to start taking my daily dose  After I eat my breakfast  Vitamins are the most misunderstood things ever  You talk to some doctors  They say your food you eat on a daily basis gives you enough vitamins  And then others say you've got to take vitamins  So what do you do?  What do you do?  No one knows  Shut up  The average person does not get their vitamins from their diet 
[01:21:30]  That's what I hear  They don't eat right  I hear you really don't need that many  Do you eat your veggies?  Yeah  Alright, then you're probably alright  I eat veggies  I do a little multivitamin  I just like the sound of it  Most people do  The thing is, if you're eating so poorly  Here it is  If you're eating so poorly  That you're not getting the vitamins that you need  For your daily vitamin intake  You're supposed to have every day  You need more help than just vitamins  You know what I'm saying?  Do you hear me?  Do you understand?  Yeah, but I think that most people I know who are healthy 
[01:22:00]  Take a vitamin supper  Boring  And I think that  No, no, no  The key  This is we're helping people  Boring  We're helping people  We're helping people  Boring  Like when James Earl Jones  Said  Where are my vitamins?  No, no  He said  Let's say hi to Bobby and Yonkers  Bobby  Good evening  Hi, Bobby  Bobby  I'm here  Good morning  How are you?  Alright, Bobby  Better now  I was watching TV last night 
[01:22:30]  Saw the commercial  Sitting with my wife  I fell off the chair laughing  And she's the most insulting thing she ever saw  That's how I know it's funny  Ah, see  Exactly the way we wanted it to work  How kind of stick in the mud did you marry?  She doesn't like a good fat joke  No, she looked at me  I can't believe we're getting away with a fat joke  It's a fat joke  With our TV commercial  More proof, by the way  We're failing in radio  Hoo-hoo  Hoo-hoo  Alright, Bobby  I'm glad you enjoyed the commercial 
[01:23:00]  By the way  You can see the commercial on YouTube  Just throw Opie and Anthony in the search  And our TV commercial's up there as well  Yeah, it'll pop up  Alright, Bobby  Thank you  Let's go to Cromwell  From Wackbag  Cromwell  Hey, I was watching the Yankee game last night  And they showed two versions of the commercial  Ah  They did?  Yeah, the first one they showed  Was the one where Anthony goes  It's your fat ass  Which, by the way  Is the better line  And the second one was where Opie goes  It's definitely not the dress  Yeah, he looks mixed to face  And goes, yeah, it's not the dress  Well, we had to have a safe line 
[01:23:30]  Which Jimmy won't do  He's a smart guy  Yeah  When they say one for safety  And use this line  Jimmy goes, go F yourself  They tried to get me to do that  From my Hammerstein ballroom  November 10th  Ticketmaster show  They wanted me to do one without the tranny  And I'm like, ah, no  No, because then they'll use that one  Let's get one for safety  What do you think?  I just started in this business?  No  By the way  Your commercial's up on YouTube as well  I check that out  On a regular basis  Yes, just throw Opie and Anthony in the search  Or actually, in that case 
[01:24:00]  Jim Norton in the search  It'll pop right up for you  In the other one  They had her calling me daddy  It was so good  Hi, daddy  And she squealed  And we walked away  That was the one I really wanted  That's the one you want, right?  A little too probably homoerotic  Safety  Let's do one for safety  Let's do one for safety, please  Cromwell  Shut up  This one's dangerous  Cromwell, you like the commercial?  Yeah, it's awesome  All right, very good  Thank you  A lot of people said it was  They've seen it online  But it's like different when you see it on TV  Yeah, yeah  It kind of surprises you  You're watching the game 
[01:24:30]  It pops on you  Like, ooh  It's the size of your television  Right, right  Not your computer monitor  All right, let's go to Bruce in Pennsylvania  Bruce  Good morning  Good morning  Hey, Bruce  Hey, boys  Just want to let you know  I hit Ticketmaster.com  To look for some nice $10 tickets  For the Cleveland gig  And they were all sold out this morning  Those bastards  This is what's going to happen  We're going to sell 20 tickets today  At the regular price  And then we're going to probably  Have to drop it again  All right  And then Pete will have  Some kind of excuse  Like something to do  With a nuclear explosion 
[01:25:00]  In the Cleveland area  And how something's got to  Come off the back end  That's right  We're doing it for breast cancer  Right  What?

[01:25:30]  For our comedy show  It's the tsunami  Right  We're doing this  In honor of the tsunami victims  It's to promote  Homosexual tolerance  Jesus Pete  For all these awful reasons  Alright we're going to take a break  When we get back  We have Jim McGreevy on Oprah  Oh  Yeah  We have  Waiting for this audio  We have the MacBook entries  Ooh  They stink  Of course they do  We have  Picking up Girls Made Easy  From 1975  Oh nice

Wearing his tutu  Revealing slacks  Pull that wad of cash  Out of the front of his pants  It's got to be  What he's hiding in there  Absolutely that  Or he's smuggling a mushroom  I've had enough  Of his form showing slacks  What did he get  The Ben blessing? 
[01:28:00]  I don't know  That Chernoff walks around  Just crotch first  He loves it  Like his antenna  Oh my god  He wants to make sure  Nothing's in his way  As he walks  Oh he really is  It's like he's looking  For metal on the beach  I don't know how he gets slacks  That show him off like that  But god love him  That's great  They're like Speedos  Speedos slacks  Alright  Now I'll see him in the hallway  And he'll have to make you uncomfortable  Sorry you don't like my slacks 
[01:28:30]  I'm just kidding  By the way  Your contest is better than my contest  What was your contest?  I was talking about it  During the second half of the show  Well I guess the post show meeting  During the post show meeting?

Because their bra and panties are never revealing  They wear these  Those very  Down the thighs  I want to see  I want to see like  Big  Nasty  Cellulite  Down the legs  And if you have a sense of humor 
[01:31:00]  You will allow us to throw mustard on you  Just throw mustard on you  How about a tutu  And she has to put  Here's what she has to do  Okay  She has to take her awful arms  And put them on the top of her head  Like with her finger  Like a little ballerina  Like a ballerina  And she has to spin in a fat circle going  Tweedly-deedly-dum  Big fat monster  While we throw raw eggs at her  See money talks  If we get enough money  Yeah  They'll be lining up  And stupid Stacey Washington has something

Why can't it be a fat man?  Because that's what we said  Because fat women  Much funnier  Much funnier  Because here it is  It's all about the funny  You know the double standard we talked about  How you got the hot teacher  That is going out with a 14 year old student  And she gets the interviews  And doesn't go to jail  But if it's the other way around 
[01:32:00]  It's different  Right  This is the same thing  Fat guy  Not funny  Fat woman  In a bikini  Hysterical  Funny  To look at  That's right  That's right  Because they're just monsters  We have money yet?

[01:38:00]  Visit XMRadio.com to subscribe.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:38:30]  Here, check it out. The Opie and Anthony Show.  The O&A virus spreading across America.  Gary Hoey playing live for us today in studio.  We still have lots of radio to do.  Contest is on, by the way, officially.  How long do you want to do it for, Jimmy? A month?  Yeah, I think so. 
[01:39:00]  Because I think we'll get people traveling from all over America.  And Steve asked me a question about can women be single.  Yeah, you don't have to have a guy attached to you.  We just said there's a couple.  But it's about you, not about your relationship.  So, you're single? Fine.  It's Jimmy's contest.  So, Jimmy, explain really fast again.  It starts Monday, by the way.  We need a name for it.  Right now, I call it the Fat Disgusting Pig Contest.  Where the bigger the mess you are, the more money you're likely to win.  You bring in these disasters that you're dating.  You have to put on a bikini. 
[01:39:30]  And we're paying $10 a pound to the winner.  So, yeah.  If you're a big fatso, if you ate, say, $3.51, that's $3,500.  Wow.  You can use that to buy yourself a lunch or do whatever it is you want to do with $3,500.  Lunch.  I want to call it the Tiffy Toodles Contest.  I like that, too.  Hey, we're getting feedback in.  Jerry, very, very upset.  Please, guys, can you have some compassion and not be so degrading to your fellow person? 
[01:40:00]  There is no need for this type of contest.  You have really crossed the line this time.  I hope nobody shows up.  And let me tell you something.  Money does not always talk.  Oh, sorry, Jimmy.  It's exclamations.  I'm not supposed to read anything with exclamations.  Jerry is hot under the collar.  Money does not always talk.  Obese people are not animals and have feelings, too.  Yes, they do, Jerry.  The feelings they have are twangs of hunger pains. 
[01:40:30]  I hope one day you guys feel what these people go through every day.  And maybe you will find out how hard it is to have this disease.  Yes, we will feel what it's like to be an obese person, sir, if we ever land on Jupiter.  And before you start thinking it, I am not overweight, but I do have a heart and car.  Car.  What?  I don't know.  He has a heart and car.  Apparently, if you're fat, you don't have a heart because you've eaten it. 
[01:41:00]  And what about the car?  Well, normally, after a certain weight, they have to put you in a horse trailer and drive you around.  And we will prove that money talks.  It certainly does.  You watch how many fatties come through that door starting Monday.  And someone's got to start the contest.  So you're thinking, I'm only 220.  Just show up so we can get the contest going.  We have to – and by the way, we'd like you to eat something fattening on the air.  It could be just a slice.  You don't have to eat anything to throw up. 
[01:41:30]  But we have to give some kind of a consolation, like runner-up prizes, too.  It doesn't have to be that kind of money, but it should be something because someone might go,  Oh, I'm 280. I'll never win.  Well, you've got to start somewhere, though.  Yeah, we'll just get the contest going.  Then hopefully, we'll develop it.  I want to do it for about a month because I think people will make plans to travel to New York to win all that fine money.  And I'm thinking the prize is going to get a lot larger, by the way, as we move forward.  As will the women.  Cigars and Scotch, what's up?  Hey, what's going on?  Hi.  You can call it the beauty pageant for black and Hispanic males to watch. 
[01:42:00]  They do, like, a fat white one, don't they?  Yeah.  What is that?  I don't know.  Before you do that story really fast, the headline in the New York Post today,  No Return to Earth.  Howard.  Howard Stern and Sirius Satellite Radio are denying radio industry rumors.  It's all they do all day.  It's all they do all day.  What?  Talk about Howard all day. 
[01:42:30]  What?  Sorry.  It's just a reflex.  We should read some of these, actually.  Of course we should.  You really want to get into some fun.  Howard Stern and Sirius Satellite Radio are denying radio industry rumors that Stern will do an Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  Let it be known we went to satellite first.  Howard likes to think that he came up with this brilliant idea.  Not only did we do it first, then we came up with the next brilliant idea, which was to do both.  Because we still have a passion to do radio.  That's what we do.  So, and they're even calling it the Opie and Anthony. 
[01:43:00]  Denying radio industry rumors that Stern will do an Opie and Anthony and return to regular radio while continuing to also be space delivered.  And then there's a quote from Howard, which is just beyond funny.  He makes it too easy.  Yeah.  I don't do Opie and Anthony, Stern told listeners yesterday.  Opie and Anthony do me.  That's right.  You want to admit something on Oprah there, Howard?  What?  We do him.  You want to admit something on Oprah?  That's right.  Bend over. 
[01:43:30]  Unbelievable.  You want us to do you?  What?  I was hoping Opie would laugh after that one.  Which one?  The Opie and Anthony quote.  I was hoping that you'd read it.  I can't today, Jimmy, and I wanted to.  Oh, I would love that.  The right side of my throat has shut down.  It's really, really sore.  And I'm very full of phlegm.  So, can you play the Opie part?  I don't do it justice, but you read it.  All right.  Uh, Howard said, I don't do Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony do me.  Ah, that's terrific. 
[01:44:00]  Ah, I sound like that.  No, but that's the best I can do.  Uh, Imus was talking with that young lady and just opened up his jacket and showed his  shirt to her.  All right, cool.  Is that a good impersonation?  Ah, wow.  That was a very, very good impersonation.  Yes, that was very, very good.  I do impersonations.  You do.  I've heard you do a few, and that one was pretty cool.  He does these impersonations.  I swear, you would think it was the real people.  Yeah.  I do, Mr. T. 
[01:44:30]  By the way, Howard wants to go back to regular radio, but he can't because that little satellite  company, you know, paid him way, way, way too much money.  Oh, yeah.  The reality is we were able to do this because we're not getting paid enough.  Because they paid us crap.  That's right.  Pretty much why.  It is killing him that we're doing both.  Oh, he could say whatever the hell he wants on his stupid show.  This was in our grand plan.  That's right.  That's right.  Checkmate.  And when we talk, people are listening.  And he has to listen to Mel. 
[01:45:00]  Mel told him to get on the radio and deny the rumors because Howard was loving the rumors  because people were talking about him again.  But Mel, because we know how Mel works, sat Howard down and said, you get on your show  and you say these rumors are false because the stock was collapsing yesterday on the rumors.  He puts out these rumors.  I know.  He puts them out because he was upset because, if you remember, a couple of days earlier there  was an article in the paper about how his popularity is dropping off.  He's not in the news anymore. 
[01:45:30]  His website hits have dropped 90 percent.  No water cooler talk.  Just kind of disappearing from the cultural landscape.  And it got him so PO'd.  What did he do?  What did he do?  He put out a rumor that he was going to do what we're doing and rip us off.  He put out a rumor himself.  He did it.  We know.  We've spoken with people. 
[01:46:00]  He does these things to get in the news and then gets on and denies it.  Well, because Mel tells him to.  Yeah.  Because the stock was being affected.  It affects the stock when you say, you know, you're not going to be exclusive, things like that.  Right.  And believe me, yeah, Sirius jumped right in, too.  One of their spokespeople.  No, he's not going anywhere.  He's exclusively ours.  And I'm having the time of my life here.  It's the best thing I've ever done.  Really?  No, it's not. 
[01:46:30]  You know it's not.  Talking to how many people?  You know it's not.  And here's the reality because people are going to call us on this.  Because Howard is the only thing that Sirius has going for it.  We joined a company that had a lot more things going for it.  And that's the difference.  Be honest.  You know, if we leave XM, let's say, the company will still thrive.  That's the reality.  It will.  And we understand that.  And how he attributes every single subscriber over there to himself is the most pompous, ignorant thing. 
[01:47:00]  And how some of the fans believe it is amazing.  Like every sub over there now, he considers one of his listeners.  There are people who have never heard his name that are subscribers.  There are cars on parking lots, on car lots, waiting to be sold that have free subscriptions that are being counted as a subscriber. 
[01:47:30]  Right.  Are they listening to him?  He has a percentage of that audience listening to him.  And it's a small percentage of that audience that subscribed.  And it's a very small percentage of the audience he had on terrestrial radio.  And people are subscribing for other things.  Yeah, of course they're going to.  Whatever crap they have over there.  But he likes to attribute every subscriber to him.  Yeah.  Like they're all listening to him at one time.  Well, it's called Howie Math.  Howie Math.  Howie said that there's no way he's going back to regular radio. 
[01:48:00]  He has over 4.7 million people subscribing to Sirius.  What?  They're not listening to you, you tool.  The post goes, well, we estimated that about a million.  About a million listen to him.  So he's a little off.  Just a little bit.  That's a realistic estimate.  The experts have estimated.  Wall Street has estimated he did about a million.  And even that.  But he's telling his listeners, and they're buying into it, that because of him, there's  4.7 million people.  Even that, they're not listening all at the same time. 
[01:48:30]  It's not like at any given moment he has a million.  You've got a million people that subscribe to listen to him.  But at any given moment, it's in the hundreds of thousands.  It's not even in the millions.  Right.  But you can tell because of the scary numbers Artie's movie did.  Anyway.  Where's that power?  Where's that selling power?  You want to read a few of these real fast, or you want to move on to that? 
[01:49:00]  This is the story of the day.  Whackbag has a thread going, which takes some of the stupidest posts on a few of the Stern  message boards and posts them and just makes fun of them.  I never imagined that his fans could be so completely stupid and ignorant and just blindly  follow him.  Well, they drank the Kool-Aid.  They completely drank the Kool-Aid. 
[01:49:30]  Everyone else is realizing how ridiculous Howard is with the things he says.  Yeah.  But still, he's got a bunch of fans that believe whatever he says.  So this is some of his fans.  No matter what we do, it's bad.  Right.  No matter what he does, it's good.  Right.  No matter how successful we are, it counts as failure.  And no matter how much he fails, it's success.  It's the oddest thing to look at.  And ONA fans at least write some really funny things.  Our fans are very creative. 
[01:50:00]  Yeah.  Very clever.  And they're pretty, for the most part, realistic.  Yeah.  You know, our fans, they're pretty realistic.  They're pretty intelligent when it comes to radio, knowing what's going on, things like  that.  There are a few idiots, of course, but for the most part.  Does no star fan have spell check?  You know, they're just dopes, too.  Howie does Howie math.  I want to start doing Opie math.  How many cars are in America?  Four billion.  All right, then we have four billion listeners.  Yep.  That doesn't count wheels.  16 billion wheels.  We have one listener per wheel. 
[01:50:30]  Four billion.  There's 300 million people in this country.  Yeah, but they all have five.  You're giving them how many cars?  12 cars each.  Yeah, but you're not counting the Arabs that live here and the Asians.  Oh.  Okay.  We have a million cars each.  Here we go.  The first one, O and Gay.  All right.  I don't think I've heard that one yet, though.  There's a reason for it.  It's devoid of humor.  It is just awful.  O and Gay TV commercial.  Instead of O and A. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah, instead of O and A.  We've taken a bunch of calls today, this morning, about the O and A TV commercial.  Yeah.  It's getting rave reviews, by the way.  And what was that website?  It was the spot of the week or one of the commercials of the week.  Ad Week.  Ad Week, named one of the best commercials of the week.  You can check it out.  We're not hiding.  You can check out the commercial for yourself on YouTube.  Yeah.  Go ahead.  Just about everyone's saying it's a really, really funny, clever commercial.  It hits the point.  It tells what we're about.  All right.  What are they saying about the TV commercial? 
[01:51:30]  O and Gay TV commercial.  Yeah.  It's to the best.  This guy loves using the word gay, too.  It certainly does.  It certainly does.  Anyone else see the O and Gay TV commercial last night for Free FM?  Oh, man, are they gay?  Talk about turning corporate and doing whatever CBS radio wants them to.  They are play acting in the spot, acting like clothing store employees.  It's so bad, dot, dot, dot.  So gay.  Let me interrupt here. 
[01:52:00]  Yes.  Play acting.  Play acting.  Isn't that kind of what you do when you film something?  When you're filming something.  It's not called play acting.  It's called acting.  We are actors.  And he goes, like, acting like clothing store employees.  It's so bad.  It's so gay.  Where's the homosexual implication in two store employees?  Yeah.  Do you mind?  It's a dramatization.  Drama.  A little drama.  We did a little dramatization.  Thank you. 
[01:52:30]  And now here's the negative spin on something that was incredibly positive.  Right.  Because us being, you know, brand new.  Well, not brand new, but coming back to terrestrial radio.  Something tells me you don't need a TV commercial if the buzz is so hot.  What is it that tells you that?  I'd love to know if it's intuition.  Yeah.  Or a man whose lap he's bobbing his head up and down in.  Go ahead.  Ever wonder why Infinity CBS never spent any money advertising Howard when he was on regular radio? 
[01:53:00]  No TV spots.  No billboards.  Nada.  Wasn't necessary.  The fact that CBS is making Owen Gay spots tells me they are not doing as well as they claim to be doing.  Uh-oh.  This kid has intuition.  He's on Toss.  Now, we've been working for CBS again for-  Four months.  Four months or so.  August, September.  Almost five months.  Almost five months.  This well-informed Howard fan does not remember back in the 80s when Howard got fired from NBC and then Mel picked him up and put him at WXRK in New York that there were television commercials running like crazy. 
[01:53:30]  I remember one in particular was a priest.  The voiceover said something about, hey, did you hear Howard Stern got fired from WNBC?  And the priest says, thank God, and looks up at heaven and says, but he's been hired at WXRK in New York. 
[01:54:00]  And he says something about there is a devil.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.  Well, in this post-  Plenty of spots.  Hey, how about WNBC?  Remember?  If we weren't so bad, we wouldn't be so good.  It was a big billboard of the lineup, and all of them, Imus and Howard, dressed horribly in leather and stuff, cutting through this billboard with a chainsaw and having some kind of tagline after they were through doing that. 
[01:54:30]  There were plenty of billboards.  There are some right now.  Well, Anthony, it says in the post, if the buzz is so hot.  Well, you know, if the buzz was so hot, then why did Howard have to spend a year on his regular radio show to talk about how he's moving his satellite radio?  Another good point.  Thank you.  Good point.  Move on to the cell phone thing before we take a break, because that was just amazing.  This amazed me as probably the dumbest individual I've ever seen post on a message board. 
[01:55:00]  But people buy into it.  Yep, they do.  If it wasn't for Howard plugging away for Cellular One ads back in the late 80s, he was the biggest voice.  Who knows how long it would have took?  What happened?  I read that.  It would have took.  For phones to catch on.  How about it would have taken?  But who knows how long it would have took for the cell phone to catch on?  You know, the cell phone. 
[01:55:30]  So we have Howard to thank.  Thank you for helping boost along the popularity of the who knows how long we probably still would be, you know, a number, please.  Number, please.  I know I would have been climbing a telephone pole.  Hello, Sarah.  Can you get me Klondike 50606?  This guy has a point, though, because there was a big thing in China where there's a billion people, and they had actually attributed it to those plugs.  Right.  As to why it's going on. 
[01:56:00]  The Cellular One ads he did in the late 80s.  That right there is, I am, the dumbest post I've ever seen on a message board.  I'll agree.  He gets the slow clap.  Yeah.  Ladies and gentlemen, the dumbest post ever.  And we have three sheets here chock full of the dumbest posts I've ever read. 
[01:56:30]  All right.  We'll try to do more maybe tomorrow because we've got to take a break, and we have to get into the story of the day next.  We're busy.  That's right.  We're going to go right to break, Gary, because we're really late.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  I love showing my introverted fat guys.  Whip them out Wednesday.  Whip them out Wednesday.  It's the O.B. and Anthony show.  We're back with the O.B. and Anthony show. 
[01:57:00]  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Spreading across my throat as well.  This off the instant feedback.  If it wasn't for Howie plugging 1-800-MATTRESS, we would still be sleeping on the floor.  On straw.  On straw.  Thank you, Howie.  Sleeping on straw.  Thanks for everything.  Gary Howie doing a great job for us.  Live in studio.  Let's go to Mike in Pittsburgh. 
[01:57:30]  Mike, what's up?  Make it fast.  What's up, guys?  Hey, Mike.  Hey, I just won tickets to your show up in Cleveland.  Yeah, I hear Pittsburgh, K-Rock, is doing something really cool.  They're getting some winners, and they're sending them to the show in Cleveland.  Nice.  Like it.  Very cool, Mike.  Yeah, I'll check out Jimmy Norton, too, when he comes out of Pittsburgh.  Who wouldn't?  So, I'll be headlining those shows, doing a lot more material, and making funny faces.  All right. 
[01:58:00]  Bud Light presents the Opie and Anthony Traveling Virus to Comedy Event of 2006.  We've got one day left.  It's this Saturday in Cleveland at the Tower City Amphitheater.  Tickets are going, uh...  Like warm cakes.  Yeah.  Like slightly warm pop tarts.  Tickets on sale now through all Ticketmaster locations.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  And we'll be broadcasting live from Cleveland on Friday.  Mike, thanks.  We'll see you at the show, okay?  All right, guys.  Have a good one now.  I think we've got our first contestant for the Fat Contest.  Oh, good. 
[01:58:30]  Sarah in Queens.  Hi.  Hi, Sarah.  Hi, how are you?  Pretty good.  What's up?  Nothing.  How are you guys doing?  Good.  How are you?  Fine.  Thank you.  So I want to know if I can come in tomorrow instead of Monday, because I have to work on  Monday.  You could come in tomorrow?  Yes.  The deal is we're looking for the fattest girl out there.  Mm-hmm.  We're going to pay $10 a pound, maybe more.  We can guarantee $10 a pound.  So how much do you weigh?  $230.  $230.  All right, you'll get the contest going.  $230.  And if no one comes in that's bigger than you, then guess what? 
[01:59:00]  You win $2,300.  What's $230 look like?  $230, you think.  How tall are you?  I'm 5'6".  Yeah, you're huge.  You're what size are you?  $16.  You're about a size 16.  And here's the beautiful thing about this contest.  If you come in at a certain weight, and then on the last day of the contest, you put more  weight on, that makes you...  Look, you have a month.  If you come in at $230, and you put on like 8 pounds...  Because you know someone beat you by a pound or two? 
[01:59:30]  Absolutely.  We'll see who the competitors are out there.  I guess my diet's out the window.  Nah, just for a month.  After a month, you go back to it.  Is this the fattest you've been?  Huh?  Is this the fattest you've been?  No, I used to be a size 6.  A size 6?  I used to, yeah.  So this is the biggest you've been?  So this is the fattest you've been.  The biggest I've been is a size 20.  Wow, I actually lost a little weight.  All right, hold on the line.  You're going to start the contest off tomorrow, proving Jerry wrong.  That's right.  Jerry, from the instant feedback, saying that no one will do this, and money is not important, 
[02:00:00]  blah, blah, blah.  Holiday season right around the corner, right?  Oh, I'm money, yeah.  That's what you're thinking.  Yes.  Sarah, we'll be nice to you.  You've got to buy your Santa suit.  Bye, Sarah.  Hold on the line.  We'll be nice to you tomorrow, right?  Sure.  Just bring in your fatness.  Sarah and Queens will start the contest tomorrow.  I want Superman soup.  It's on the way.  I'm hungry.  Hey, can we do the story of the day before we get out of here?  Yes.  Oh, please.  And move over to XM?  God, I love this story.  What's this about, Anthony?  I didn't even read it yet.  Everyone's saying this is a great one. 
[02:00:30]  Man gets home confinement for groping.  Now.  I just read this.  Isn't this great?  I love this guy.  This guy is fantastic.  He is a genius.  He should get an Oscar.  He should get an Oscar.  Why do people get Oscars for this type of acting, yet this man is being arrested?  Well, home confinement.  Uh, Charleston, West Virginia, a man accused of fondling home health care nurses while posing  as a mentally retarded person who needed diapers changed has been sentenced to a year of home 
[02:01:00]  confinement.  William Mucklow.  It's old Bill Mucklow.  Hello, Bill.  Need your diaper change, Bill?  I need my diaper change.  He's, uh, 40 years old of Charleston, sentenced Tuesday, uh, after pleading guilty to two  counts of battery, a magistrate clerk said two fraud charges, uh, were dismissed. 
[02:01:30]  Mucklow was ordered, Mucklow was ordered to pay court cause and visit, uh, and pay one  victim more than $400 in restitution.  This is pretty cheap.  Yeah.  You know, usually things like this, uh, you spend time in jail, a lot more money goes  out to people, but West Virginia, they don't care.  Mucklow, posing as his mother, responded to ads for a health, a home health care workers  and hired two nurses, telling them a man with the mind of a two or three year old needed 
[02:02:00]  care, according to the criminal complaint.  Police said Mucklow then posed as the, uh, man, a mental, uh, mentally retarded person.  The nurses who worked separately in February and March of 2004 said Mucklow grabbed their  breasts while they cared for him.  So he was groping them, uh, as they were changing him or, or, uh, uh, doing whatever they would 
[02:02:30]  do for a 40 year old man with the mind of a two or three year old child.  But what a, like, what, what a great gimmick.  Pervert.  What a great gimmick for a pervert.  Oh no, that Bill Mucklow's at it again.  I would have loved to just heard.  Hello?  Yes, this is Mrs. Mucklow.  I have a son, 40 years old, Billy.  My little Billy's got the mind of a two year old.  It's so sad. 
[02:03:00]  He needs his diaper changed.  Changed?  Oh yes, very important to, um, ask you a quick, no references.  No, that's fine.  Not references.  No, where else have you been, no, no, no.  How big are your breasts?  That's all I need to know.  Come on down.  Don't, Mucklow, he posed as a mother.  What a, what a psycho Norman Bates kind of thing to do.  This is from the Washington Post. 
[02:03:30]  This is great.  He's an embarrassment to the Mucklow legacy.  Can we get audio of this?  He's not a Mucklow.  Can we get audio of this from the news?  From the West Virginia Mucklows?  My goodness.  There's a, there's a wing in the library donated to them.  We're dedicated, whatever.  Or, whar.  Yeah.  Because most people just assault people.  This guy fought it out.  Like, what could I do?  I want to, I want to grope, but I really don't want to get in trouble for it. 
[02:04:00]  So I need a plan.  Retarded people rarely get in trouble.  They should be lenient on this guy for being brilliant.  Brilliant.  Retarded people can grope all they want.  You notice that?  Yep.  You never see retarded man arrested for groping.  It's accepted.  Retarded people can just, ah, grab anything they want on the street.  And it's just, oh, he's retarded.  How did he get himself away?  He probably blew it, like, while he was grabbing and naked.  He probably went, hurry up.  I have to get to my job at the bank. 
[02:04:30]  What?  Nothing?  Yes.  Yes, your job at the bank.  He probably got so horned up that he just went into regular voice.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Because maybe the woman was allowing it, and he just read it wrong.  You're being a little playful.  That's right, bitch.  I mean, da.  Google gaga.  Yeah.  Google booby.  It's like that old Bugs Bunny cartoon.  Yeah.  The gangster.  Ah, go chase yourself.  That posed as a baby, right?  Oh, yeah. 
[02:05:00]  Yeah, yeah.  Baby face finsta.  Finsta.  Oh, finsta baby.  One minute left in the show.  We were just getting started with the mucklos.  Finsta shaving and tattooed and smoking a cigar.  The mucklos.  I want to leave with some IMAS audio.  He was talking all morning about the Opie and Anthony t-shirt that he's wearing on MSNBC.  That's what ruined the mucklo name.  Here's Mr. IMAS offering a fine Opie and Anthony t-shirt to one of the hot news girls from MSNBC. 
[02:05:30]  Could it be stuff from other spacecraft just floating around up there?  They're trying to figure it out.  They say that anything's possible with the International Space Station.  It could be from the Atlantis itself, so they're just not sure right now.  I don't think I've heard anyone pinpoint exactly what they think it is.  Do you want an Opie and Anthony t-shirt?  It wasn't on my list of things to buy, but if you want to throw one out at me, sure.  How about your husband?  Would he wear it?  Yeah, I think he would.  He would?  Yeah, when he's working out.  What size does he wear?  Extra large. 
[02:06:00]  Well, all right now.  God, IMAS is selling our t-shirts for us.  That's great.  All right.  She was a purdy newswoman.  I don't think he's been paid for soon.  Yeah.

[02:07:30]  The O.B. and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  We're already walking. 
[02:08:00]  That could have been the gayest song ever used for a comics promo ever.  What's wrong with Andrew?  He's a bum.  He's just yelling to himself. What's wrong?  Why is he yelling?  What?  I'm not feeling good.  Oh, God.  Goodbye.  What do you got?  I'm already sick.  You got the shits?  Hey, ma'am, you want to be in our fat contest?  Look, it's oozing through your sock now, right?  Why aren't you at the hospital?  I have to go and get my medication.  Why don't you go to the hospital? 
[02:08:30]  They don't give you nothing. They give you a lotion.  Lotion? You need antibiotics. They'll give you that. It's an infection.  Yeah.  You got, like, infection. You're going to lose your fucking feet.  You know what it's like?  I probably wind up doing that.  You know what it's like in New York City with no feet? You got to do handstands.  Maybe I'll make more money then.  No, you won't make more money.  Can we see the foot?  You should be on a skateboard.  All right. Maybe I walk with the crutches. I'll make more money.  No, you won't. 
[02:09:00]  Let me see it.  It's been fun watching the decline of Andrew, by the way.  He's a lot different than the first day we met him.  It's really bad.  It's all, like, oozing sores.  Watch. Money talks.  I do, man.  Let's see it.  They're oozing, right?  Let's see it?  It's oozing, yeah. Let's see.  Let's see. Money talks, Jerry.  Oh!  Holy shit.  Holy shit!  Andrew, Andrew, what are you doing? 
[02:09:30]  Why are you sitting here and not doing something about that?  I've been to the hospital three times already.  They're under nothing.  Scrape his leg for a future O&A contest.  All the time they want to ask is Medicaid.  What?  I don't have Medicare.  Well, you know something? They're obligated to treat you in a hospital.  It's America.  Every time I go there, I spend, like, three hours, four hours.  Well, what the fuck else you got to do? 
[02:10:00]  You're going to lose your feet.  They just give me a lotion.  Lotion. It's called antibiotic.  Do you have any?  Where's your lotion right now?  Huh?  Where's your lotion right now?  I have it here.  Bag.  Somewhere.  Is it some kind of antibiotic lotion?  No, I don't know.  Are you using it?  Skin lotion.  But it's antibiotic.  It's probably some topical, like, antibiotic.  Why don't you have penicillin?  They don't give me nothing.  Oh, my God.  The law says that you are obligated to treat you. 
[02:10:30]  They don't even give me nothing.  Anthony.  Let's see the lotion.  We see the lotion.  No health care.  All right.  Let's see the lotion.  He doesn't have health insurance.  There's no free health care here.  But, like, eventually they send them a bill, but, like, he ain't going to fucking pay it.  But they are obligated to treat him.  You've got to treat a guy whose leg is running.  If his legs are ready to fall off and he needs a penicillin.  Well, at least you shoot him like a horse.  Yeah.  All right.  That's a good option, too. 
[02:11:00]  He's going through his bag of tricks.  And his lotion's in there with some kind of lotion.  Aw.  Hey, that's nice of you, young lady.  That's very nice of you.  How about some lotion?  The true bloodshed women really do have bigger hearts.  Aw.  Aw.  That wasn't necessary.  Aw.  Look at that.  A thoughtful woman gave Andrew a half a sandwich as we're sitting here talking to him.  I don't know if it's a sandwich.  It's in foil.  Maybe it's a foot.  There's good people in the world, too.  There's good people in the world.  Maybe if it's not for good people, I wouldn't be living. 
[02:11:30]  Well, you know something?  Your good people are going to run out when you lose your feet.  Where's your lotion?  Probably I will run out myself.  All right.  You keep talking.  What happens with homeless people's feet?  Is it that you can't keep clean?  Oh, no.  Is that the problem?  Yeah, don't answer me.  It's just a radio show.  Continue to look for the non-existent lotion.  I was distracted by the dog barking.  The old man and the dog are in the area.  The old man and the dog. 
[02:12:00]  Andrew.  Andrew.  What is it with, like, homeless guys and their lower legs and feet?  Why does it get so infected?  See?  I won't tell you why.  All right.  The reason is when you go for showers, right?  Yeah.  When you go to the showers, you know, when you go for showers.  Right.  Yeah.  Three times.  There are different people, different people coming.  Right.  And if you don't have a shower, slippers.  Shower slippers.  That's where it starts.  The athlete's foot fungus, it starts as. 
[02:12:30]  Yes.  And then it cracks open your feet, and then infection gets.  So you're showering in these awful places.  People going for showers, you know.  So you need, like, flip-flops or something?  Because your feet are turning into flip-flops.  They're going to flop right off of the bottom of your ankle.  I'm flopped already.  Oh, my God.  Is that a mess?  All right, Andrew.  All right, Andrew.  Well, best of luck.  I would definitely.  You know something?  We knew a guy up there used to sit up by a standpipe up there.  What the fuck was his name? 
[02:13:00]  Mac.  Mac.  We don't see Mac no more.  I think Mac's dead.  And he had the same problem, worse than you do, but.  Oh.  I hope I get better.  Well, we don't really care.  God bless.  God bless.  All right, Andrew.  God bless.  We're moving on.  Guy's going to lose his feet.  Yep.  Or at least his socks.  Jimmy, thanks for laughing, by the way.  A what?  The fat girl.  It was funny.  I love that frigging contest we got going. 
[02:13:30]  Yep.  The fat chick contest.  It plays well off the TV commercial, by the way.  There you go.  It's a good idea from Jimmy.  Yeah?  I think there should be a fat girl on a billboard.  Yeah.  A pig.  I get to pick the next contest, by the way.  Traffic today with the U.N.  How's the traffic?  I'm a little slow.  A little slow.  People, is it really taking a long time to get to work today?  Taking a long time.  Yes, it does.  All right. 
[02:14:00]  Carry on.  Bye-bye, sir.  Thank you, sir.  Fan of the show.  I hate when they're fans of the show.  You can't goof on them.  All the people in there, like they were really being interviewed.  They're nodding their head.  They don't know that we're tools.  Hey, it's Funny De Niro again.  Where?  Look, right there.  Funny-looking De Niro just passed.  Boy, you get to know the same people during this walk, don't you? 
[02:14:30]  Unfortunately.  Unfortunately, yes.  Wow, wait.  Look at the dumper on that one.  Got you.  Oh.  I thought you were talking about the dump truck.  I know.  I was going to say, we need girls like that.  It's a dump truck.  What a great ass.  I'd like her to cut a little sticker on my lap.  What is she wearing?  Oh, this Amish lady?  No, to your right.  Huh?  Oh, wow. 
[02:15:00]  She was great in a full metal jacket.  We love you long time.  How are you, sir?  What are you doing to stay cool, AIDS?  All right.  What are you doing to stay cool, AIDS?  Hi, miss.  What are you doing to stay cool in this weather, AIDS?  Okay.  She don't want to talk to you.  Ah, she's shy.  No speaking.  Ah, she's shy.  Want to drop a log on me? 
[02:15:30]  Give you eight bucks.  All right, don't get killed, lady.  I'm just trying to talk to you.  I know.  She's running away from you.  She'd rather be in traffic than talk to Jimmy.  Oh, my God.  Cowardly prostitute.  She's running like it's the last copter out of Saigon.  She's the cowardly hooker.  If I only had chlamydia.  By the way, you guys are going to have to start the second half of the show because I'm going to have to take a flu dump.  Oh, no.  I'm not even kidding.  I got one brewing, too.  Oh, wow.  Camel toe.  Oof. 
[02:16:00]  It's going to look like mini wheats.  Look at the shorts and legs on this guy.  Wow.  All right, sir.  Is that too loud?  I'm sorry.  Did you hear that?  Oh, my God.  Are those a live person's legs?  You got girl legs.  Oh.  He looked like a flamingo.  Flamingo.  Yeah, he did.  Rubbed my bag on his legs.  All right.  There we go. 
[02:16:30]  Almost there.  Everyone with their goddamn coffee.  And their iPods.  Their iPods.  Starbucks and iPods.  That's all I see out here.  I'm going to throw a brick through the Steinway window.  Is there a window here or no?  Yeah.  I don't know.  Put your head through it.  Let's see.  No, it looks like there's windows out.  Put your fucking head through it.  You'll find out there's a fucking window.  No?  It's.  No. 
[02:17:00]  It's open.  Hello?  Is there a window here?  You dropped something.  Is there a window, though?  Yeah, there is.  There is a window?  Let's talk to the lady.  Sir, if I could have a moment of.  Is there a window here?  Huh?  Oh, it is.  That's got to be the cleanest window ever.  We wanted to come in and take our cocks out, but we saw there might be some kind of thing  there.  Right.  But there's a window, right?  She can't hear you through the.  Wait. 
[02:17:30]  She can't hear you.  She can't hear at all.  Talk to her.  She's right next to us.  Wow.  That is really.  It looks like there's no window just for the people at home.  We're looking, trying to see if your clit is big, but it looks like that there's no  window right there.  Oh, it's a bow window.  Oh.  Oh, I see.  It kind of goes in.  Yeah, and the window is so thick that she can't hear us.  Have you ever shit on a person for money?  Like that.  I can't hear?  Oh, you can't hear.  Wait, Jimmy.  All right.  You can't hear, so why don't you give her sign language?  Have you? 
[02:18:00]  Is there.  I almost.  I got it.  I got it.  The window is bowed this way, and it's just like your cunt is the same way, right?  Oh, no.  Now the guy's coming over.  The way it's coming out.  All right.  The guy's coming over.  Just for the people at home, I swear, it doesn't look like there's a window, but there actually  is.  Oh, he's pulling the curtain down?  He's pulling the curtain down.  Oh, I see.  Why?  It comes down so he can't see your cock over your big, fat gut.  Oh, all right.  Well, now they're pulling the. 
[02:18:30]  There they go.  Now we can't see them because I see.  Okay.  You have no tits anyway.  It's okay.  Does he want to lick your pussy?  Sometimes.  This guy?  Something like that.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  No, does he want to lick your pussy?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Like, is there like a thing going on between you two?  Sir?  In the back room when you're not selling pianos, do you like suck on his cock?  Did you ever love it?  All right.  Goodbye to you two.  I think she read your lips that time, Hopi.  Holy shit.  Did she run away? 
[02:19:00]  Pit over.  Oh, my God.  That could be a good video.  We'll see how it turned out.  We'll throw it up on the website.  Because they couldn't hear us at all, but it didn't look like there was a window there.  Isn't that scary to talk like that to people when they can look right at you?  Oh, I'm not.  That's disgusting.  I was shaking, actually.  Jimmy.  Somebody with AIDS threw up behind this counter and then dropped their tie on it by accident.  We've had a good radio show so far today.  Why don't you just be nice to him for once?  I love how the tie gets dropped on it every day. 
[02:19:30]  Someone walked by and they must have just fallen.  Jimmy.  Onto a big pile.  AIDS vomit.  Jimmy, turn over a new leaf today.  All right.  Here.  You go first.  Say hi.  All right.  Now be nice.  Jimmy's going to turn over a new leaf.  Come on.  And get the relationship back on track with the building guy.  I die.  Hello, sir.  How are you?  Good morning.  Good morning.  Good morning.  No, Jimmy, I don't think that was...  All right.  We'll try tomorrow. 
[02:20:00]  Hey, sir.  A warm, excellent.  That sucks.  Lesbian.  I like that in a woman.  And every other kind of DVD.  I love paying for sex.  This moral decay weakens our resistance.  Dude.  The onslaught of the communist masters of deceit.  We're a bunch of scumbags.  These abnormalities are corrupting the minds and the hearts of our children.  Jackass.  I can't believe it.  It's a pedophile humor.  Woo.  It's depressing and horrendous. 
[02:20:30]  It's awful.  A bunch of idiots.  Perversion for profit.  Here it comes.  Here it comes.  The Opie and Anthony program.  El virus.  The Opie and Anthony.  God, that irritates me.  It's just like somebody took a bath to my brain.  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  Opie.  I want my coffee.  Anthony.  I want that fact.  Jim Norton.  I want Ozzy.  We are going to dumb this thing down to the point that we're going to be number one with 
[02:21:00]  Down syndrome children.  No, baby.  It's terrible.  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll be right back. 
[02:21:30]  Welcome to the second half of the Opie and Anthony show.  That was a good walkover today.  That was a fun walkover.  And boy, did Jimmy let two nice ones loose in the elevator.  Not only with the show staff in there, but with a couple of people that were traveling up 
[02:22:00]  to higher floors that had to deal with your fucking waste product.  They sounded like this.  Let me see.  They had that strain quality.  Hold on if you can hear us.  Yeah.  You really laid it out.  You were working.  I saw your face straining.  I wish there were chicks on the elevator, man.  Yeah.  Yeah, that would have showed them.  All right.  If you're just tuning in, if you're just tuning in, you missed this. 
[02:22:30]  Nothing you have ever seen before and nothing you have ever heard before will prepare you  for the shock of my baby is black.  Now, the motion picture screen reaches its full maturity in this dramatic, bold story never  before told on the screen.  You missed that so far.  My baby is black. 
[02:23:00]  And we need more clips of that fine movie from 1961.  And you also missed some really, really, really bad news improv.  So that's what's happening.  But the big story is traffic, Pat.  You know, and every time I think of the Wall of Astoria and I think of world leaders, I  think of coming to America when James Earl Jones came to see to find Eddie Murphy. 
[02:23:30]  And he's like, where is Hakeem?  Take me to the Waldorf Astoria.  And that's where I guess the presidents get.  So where else would you meet with world leaders other than the Waldorf Astoria?  It makes sense, right?  Yeah.  Foreign policy for the masses, I guess, is his, Roger, right?  Yeah.  I mean, you've boiled it all down.  Presidents are busy with meetings. 
[02:24:00]  Waldorf Astoria is a good place to meet.  Chock full of information.  And, of course, we know the traffic restrictions.  But we're going to put all this traffic information on our website as well because it's a lot to take.  Roger, thank you.  That clip gets funnier and funnier.  Oh, dude.  Keep that in front of me, too.  When I first heard that, I really thought that there was three guys.  One guy on the street bombing and then someone else jumped in and went, well, where else would you take the president?  I've been trying to help him.  That's awful.  He's trying to bail himself out and the other guy just let him swing. 
[02:24:30]  Yeah.  Swing.  And, of course, you guys got to help us.  You're listening all over the world.  If you hear, like, news guys doing some awful improv, send it in, please.  I don't think anyone's ever going to beat that one, though.  Not that true.  With the long pause and the, uh, yeah.  What's wrong?  Someone's camera's sideways.  Oh, okay.  I was like, why is your head on the console?  I thought you were sleepy or something.  No, Kenny.  I think we're doing soup today.  We are, now, who is in, we, they have, we're off the air, uh, we do a bonus today, so we'll 
[02:25:00]  be off the air by 1101.  I want to know who at 10 will be in the soup man's fucking crib ordering soup, so we have  about, like, 1025.  I want.  We're going to go now because of traffic.  Now.  If I hear that the soup person.  It's only on 50.  No, it's 42nd and 5th.  You'll hit it all over.  What about 55th?  Isn't there one there?  Oh, there's a, but there's a flagship store, and then there might be another one, this closer 
[02:25:30]  one.  Kenny will figure it out.  Oh, okay.  You know what?  I thought there was one up here, because when I was writing for a tough crowd for a story,  we were on 53rd, and we went there one day and got soup.  Let's go to 55th.  Turkey chili.  I want turkey chili.  Go right to the turkey chili.  I want a Diet Coke and turkey chili.  All right.  Tape this for the salespeople at Free FM.  They'll come all over themselves.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  They're actually talking about a product when it's not a live read.  I want to hear the same salespeople we'll talk about tomorrow that gave me a used Mac,  which I do like, but, you know, where do we get into that tomorrow? 
[02:26:00]  How about a new one?  No, I mean, who am I?  How about a new one?  I'm going to eat fucking turkey chili out of a girl's cunt.  Oh.  That's nice.  By the way, after your contest, I got the next contest.  What is it?  And then after me, Anthony gets a contest.  Okay.  I got to think of a contest?  Yeah.  Those are hard.  Can I start teasing mine as maybe like a preview, like a fall preview?  Okay.  Well, we're doing yours starting tomorrow.  Coming this fall. 
[02:26:30]  Starting tomorrow, we start Fat Girl Contest.  And this Fat Girl Contest sounds too nice.  Oh, whatever.  Nice.  We're trying to come up with a name.  Big, slovenly mess.  The listeners have always been great when it comes to naming contests, so please name  the Fat Girl Contest for us, okay?  But it starts tomorrow.  That girl who's 2.30?  Sarah.  Sarah.  Queens.  She's going to come in tomorrow and start the whole thing.  It's a guaranteed $10 a pound to the winner.  Guaranteed.  Okay?  Excellent.  Also, I want to tease something.  I think they might have heard us on Pal Talk today when we were talking about the charity 
[02:27:00]  for the regular Joe.  Yeah, I think so.  I think so.  They heard that already?  Yeah.  We're definitely going to do that.  Yes.  We are definitely going to do that at the end of the year.  We're going to make 10 people very rich through this radio show.  Maybe not very rich, but you'll get a nice check.  Some well-needed cash.  Yes, because we're sick of giving money to real charities.  Because they don't, first of all, the victims don't usually get the money.  It's so much fucking red tape that most of the people that you want to help, and you  know, with Katrina, you try to be nice, and fucking half the people who got the money 
[02:27:30]  used it to, you know, buy $300 purses and guns.  Yeah.  Awful.  Isn't that great?  All right, so we're going to make about, I don't know, 10 or 20 of our listeners kind  of rich.  We'll call it kind of rich.  Remember the auction we had last year?  Yeah, for Katrina.  For Katrina.  We raised, how much was it?  I don't want to exaggerate.  $82,000 billion.  Yeah, that was just from my stuff.  I think it was over $100,000, wasn't it? 
[02:28:00]  It was...  Where's E-Rock?  Where is E-Rock?  $750,000.  We did a really good thing.  A gazillion.  And I didn't feel any different.  I didn't either.  I wanted a pair of black lips on my hog humming, thank you.  E-Rock.  How much money did we raise during the Opie and Anthony charity last year?  $55,000.  That's it?  Yeah.  You suck.  Everyone got caught up in it.  What?  Yeah.  Oh, because someone paid for my rollerblades and never sent a check in.  A couple people bid really high on a few items and never came through. 
[02:28:30]  You son of a bitch.  Like how much, fuckers?  Son of a bitch.  Ope's skates were well over $1,000 and we never saw a dime for them.  What'd the guy say?  We never...  We tried contacting him.  He never responded to anything.  Why would he?  What an ass.  Hopefully he's dead.  What an ass.  All right.  We were thinking about doing the charity for the regular Joe.  We got to think about this a little further.  I thought we raised more than $55,000.  I would hope so.  God.  That's nothing.  I'm going to raffle off.  I'm going to get a hard-on and you can wrap your hand around it for a buck. 
[02:29:00]  Can you please do that?  I would love to, but it's probably illegal.  I will laugh my ass.  You wrap your hand around my hard-on for a buck.  Go to charity.  Bargain at any price.  Absolutely.  Oh, here we go.  Stupid Jerry with his feedback saying these girls won't do it for money.  That money doesn't talk.  Oh, really?  Oh, contest on.  Jen in Rockaway.  Yes, Jen.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hello.  All right, Jen.  I was just trying to figure out how big your biggest girl was so far. 
[02:29:30]  We only haven't had anyone yet, actually.  Yeah, so far no one has come in.  And you're having it for how long?  A month.  A Friday?  Oh, about a month?  Yeah, because we want girls to start eating a lot to maybe beat some of the other contestants.  Yeah, okay.  I have an idea, too.  Wait a minute.  One problem we're going to run into is if there's a girl who's 370 and she comes in,  any girl under 370, like by 250, is going to say, fuck that, I can't do it.  I wonder if we should have some type of a raffle, like anyone involved in the contest is put 
[02:30:00]  into this raffle and all the non-winners, something is drawn so they do get some kind  of prize.  Because you want to encourage people to continually come in.  You don't want somebody who's 300 pounds to go, look, I'll never gain 70 pounds in a  month.  Do you know what I mean?  You don't want just one or two contestants.  Side contest.  Okay.  That's how you do it.  How?  You give a prize to the largest girl, well, the fattest girl, the heaviest girl, I should  say.  $10 a pound.  Broomy.  And then maybe a talent portion. 
[02:30:30]  Maybe a talent contest.  Or maybe who looks the most ridiculous in a bikini.  Or, I don't know, something.  We'll add some side contest.  You have to sing the song that we pick out, like maybe you have to like spin and sing a  Shirley Temple song in some kind of a tutu.  Ugh.  I don't know, we'll figure it out.  Impulsive.  Jen?  Good YouTube video.  Wonderful.  How much do you weigh?  Oh my God, no.  Go ahead, Jen, it doesn't matter.  Yeah. 
[02:31:00]  It's up there.  We're actually going to be nicer to you than you think.  Yeah, Jen.  It's up there.  That's okay.  Trust me.  There are many women of different shapes and sizes.  But trust me, the contest, hold on, Jen.  The contest is twisted, but we're going to handle it in a mature manner.  Of course we are.  You know?  So, how much do you weigh?  Sarah weighs 230.  So, don't be ashamed.  How much do you weigh, Jen?  Um, I'm plus 350, Mark.  Oh! 
[02:31:30]  Wow.  Go on, you should have yuck it up.  Now, you know what, sweetheart?  If you're, what are you, about 360, 365?  Probably.  If you, if you come in here, that's, that would be a tough one to beat.  That is tough.  You literally would walk out, at the end of the contest, if you won, you would have  $3,600 or $3,700.  That's a lot of money.  $3,000.  We're up to $10 a pound.  We might go higher with the money.  Turkey chili for everybody.  Where would I have to go? 
[02:32:00]  That was the whole thing that I was wondering.  All right.  Hold on the line, okay?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Are you kidding me?  We're going to get girls to do this.  Yeah, what?  Because they're already big girls.  We're not saying you got to change your life.  It's like, yeah, it's a little embarrassing.  You feel stupid.  But the possibility of a fucking, of three grand?  I mean, who doesn't want that?  Or 3,500 bucks?  No, we could do.  We could do the girl that is the heaviest.  Yeah.  For the main prize.  Yes.  We could do the girl that gains the most weight by the end of the contest.  Fuck yes. 
[02:32:30]  Yes.  But you have to start with, you know, you got to be, you got to be big to begin with.  Big monster to start with.  Oh, you have to be, yeah, you have to be absolutely.  You have to be big to begin with.  So, you know, girls under 110 pounds are not qualified for this contest.  Go away.  Go away, you freaks.  What's the minimum weight?  We have to have a minimum weight, too.  I would say.  175?  I would say lower, to be honest with you.  Because then they could really pack on the pounds. 
[02:33:00]  They can eat a lot.  They can eat a lot.  Yeah.  Yeah.  All right, see, we're figuring out as we go.  We got heaviest girl, the one that gains the most weight, and we got maybe a talent competition  with your fatness.  Maybe a big fat girl can sing Tura, Lura, Lura.  There's three contests right there, Jimmy.  Yep.  Is that good?  All in one?  Yeah, because you want people to be involved.  You don't want people who are like, all right, I'll never make that weight, but I'm still  a disgusting fat body.  You want to be able to get them all in.  Can we start contests now, ends Halloween night, when we do our Halloween party? 
[02:33:30]  Yes.  Oh, my God.  Live, live at the Halloween party.  The kid is back, thinking about radio.  Oh, my God.  It ends at the Halloween party.  What a motivated...  You show up dressed as Jupiter.  Possibly the fat girl doing the talent thing she did on the show, in front of everybody,  eating.  Oh, my God.  Game on.  What day is today?  The spark, the inspiration from yesterday's meeting. 
[02:34:00]  Look how long it took.  Yeah.  Under 24 hours.  Yeah.  We decided to regroup yesterday.  Have you noticed?  Did you notice?  That's right.  Did you notice, people?  We did.  We had a little meeting.  We sat around.  We talked about the show, the direction we wanted to go in, what we're doing, what we've  been doing, what we haven't been doing.  And maybe you've noticed during the course of this show.  All right.  Is Jen coming in tomorrow?  Jen.  Yeah.  You're going to try to come in tomorrow? 
[02:34:30]  I can't make it tomorrow, but I was thinking maybe next week or so.  All right.  Well, make sure you come because there's a lot of money at stake.  All right.  Here's the...  We're not fucking around.  Look, we like to...  And a lot of stake, if that's better for you.  We like to figure things out live and stuff.  So, I got something else to throw in there, Jimmy.  What, baby?  Jimmy's contest.  Now, there's going to be a lot of girls.  Possibly Jen is one of these girls.  She really doesn't want...  I'll get everybody's soup. 
[02:35:00]  What is wrong with you?  Did you get soup?  We're getting soup, too.  Is that all right?  Oh, fuck.  Look, I didn't get Biggie.  Is that enough if it's not home?  It's all right.  He just bought a $70,000 car and wrote a check for it.  Where's my $20 back?  Give me my 20, fam.  Thank you, Anthony.  I will treat for the wonderfulness of the soup.  The soup Nazi soup.  All right.  Someone read the instant feedback.  We've got to get a name for the contest.  Here's something else.  Because I'm feeling that Jen wants to come in, but she's a little scared. 
[02:35:30]  Right, Jen?  You're afraid we're going to humiliate her.  Yeah, kind of.  If you don't want anyone to know who you are, you show up wearing a mask.  We will have masks provided for you.  Your face won't be all over the internet if you don't want it to be.  Right.  We'll have things in the green room that you can choose, whether it's a pig's mask or a  pig mask or a paper bag or I don't know.  Okay, but the one thing is, let's get something straight.  I am this weight. 
[02:36:00]  No matter what I wear, people are going to know who I am if they know me.  No, there's plenty of fatties out there.  No, but please.  You wear a bikini.  We'll put something on.  Trust me.  Nobody will know.  You sound like an actress, by the way.  You're not an actress, are you?  No.  Okay.  Change your name and change the town you're from and you'll be good to go.  Nobody will know.  Unless you walk around your town completely nude.  Yeah.  No.  All right, Jen.  You'll be comfortable.  We promise you.  I would have already been on the news then.  They'd have pushed me back.  No, you'll be comfortable.  We promise you.  Jen, do you know where to go? 
[02:36:30]  No, I don't.  Didn't they get your info?  No.  Who's not working today?  We put you on hold for a reason.  Yeah.  All right, hold on.  We don't want to lose you.  You're a nice weight.  Okay.  Do you want this now?  What is it?  It's a prescription.  Oh, your prescription's in.  Already?  What is it?  You know, I think you may have built up an immunity.  There's an A and a Z in there.  Shut up.  I almost took one of your boner pills. 
[02:37:00]  I didn't have boner pills.  Ooh, this is something different.  All right, I'll try it.  Is that from Dr. Steve?  Comes in a storybook.  Is that from Dr. Steve?  It's from my doctor.  My Dr. Steve sends me pills that I need, too, for my penis, and I need more.  All you need to know.  It's a prescription.  It's for some kind of antibiotic.  And when are we going to have, I took a boner pill t-shirt. 
[02:37:30]  You know what I love?  The fact that Opie has like half a little pain in his throat, half a sore throat.  Within minutes, he has antibiotic there that will fix that up.  Yeah.  If you have the same Dr. Zelvis, you can get things done.  We pass Andrew, whose feet are rotting off of him, and he can't get one fucking pill that  might save his feet.  Opie's got a little tickle. 
[02:38:00]  I got a little tickle in my throat.  And a homeless man is ready to start walking on his ankles.  Isn't life grand?  Life sucks ass.  I want soup.  I want soup, too.  It's because I'm white and I'm insured.  Being white really is the shit.  You bet it is.  Who comes in second?  Hey, why isn't Sam nodding?  Asians?  Nothing.  That was good. 
[02:38:30]  Sam was like, just had his head spinning around in a yes and no kind of direction.  I know.  No, I don't.  I know.  No, I don't.  Yes, no.  Yes, no.  Yes, no.  Rob in Minnesota, what's up?  Good morning, boys.  Happy birthday, Jimmy.  Thank you.  Hey, I got an idea for your contest.  I got this from my wife now because she's a real heifer, and she called herself Towns  for fun, so I thought you guys could call it Towns for Funs. 
[02:39:00]  Funs?  Hey, God, that is really a...  Shut up.  Towns for Fun?  What was your name, bro?  Hi, it's Dan.  Dan in Ohio.  Dan?  How about...  It's a new guy.  Oh, what was the guy who just called him Towns for Fun?  No reason to remember him.  Okay.  Dan.  Hello, guys.  Hey.  Hey, idea for the contest, kind of dignified, a little bit laid back, but it'll get the  point across to those who listen, the Miss Jupiter contest.  Miss Jupiter contest. 
[02:39:30]  Miss Jupiter.  How about this?  Hmm.  Dan should get throat cancer.  That's the name of our contest.  Fucking Miss Jupiter.  What are we, fucking zoo crew?  It's a fat piggy contest.  Yes, it's got to be.  Why are you trying to be so kind, people?  It's the Rotund Gal competition.  Work off the word fat and pig.  Right.  See, the whole concept of this contest, and we have to explain it so much, is the fact  that girls will come in to make a lot of money, no matter what the contest is called. 
[02:40:00]  That's how it works.  How about the Miss Fat Piggy USA contest?  That would go for.  And if you're not that clever, then you could work off the word slob as well.  Slob is good.  Jesus Christ, I have got to shut off Pal Talk.  Baby girl, I can't.  I cannot get work done.  All I'm looking at is her.  She is now walking around in her fucking underwear.  It's impossible to do a show. 
[02:40:30]  I got a fucking delicious half a rod working.  I've been looking across the room at that monitor.  I thought she was braless at first.  What happened the other day where we couldn't do a show because something was going on?  Oh, some guy was jerking off on Cam.  Oh, right.  It was Jimmy Norton.  We were in a daisy chain with each other's dicks in our mouths.  Of course you can't do a show like that.  All right.  Jim in West Palm.  Hold on.  Man, why did you have to take it there?  What?  I went further.  I know.  I was just having a good nature laugh.  It's either suck your cock or nothing. 
[02:41:00]  Atta boy.  Isolate that.  Went from fun to too real.  Yeah.  Jim in West Palm.  Hey, what's going on, fellas?  Hey.  Hey.  I got an idea of what you should do.  Whoever the winner is, you make them roll in flour.  And maybe you can get Pillsbury to sponsor it.  All right.  Get some flour.  We'll get a girl to do that as part of the talent competition.  And try to find a wet spot, you know?  Okay.  We're hoping you wouldn't go with the 1961 joke, but you had to.  All right.  Find the wet spot?  Really?  Where'd you hear that?  In the back of your fucking Edsel at a drive-in theater? 
[02:41:30]  Shut up.  Little Jimmy's Fatty Cunt Test.  Elephants on Parade.  That'd be great if we could walk the contestants through the fucking Midtown Tunnel while they shit.  Use the instant feedback to come up with a name for the contest.  So far, we don't have one.  Elephants on Parade is good.  They put a thumb up each other's ass and walk through the tunnel.  That's Kara from Rochester. 
[02:42:00]  Let's see.  Chester's Liver from Whack Bag.  What about Dollars for Disasters?  Smokezilla from Whack Bag.  Bucks for Bunts.  Squeal or no squeal?  All right.  That's kind of funny with the pig squeal thing.  It's not offensive enough.  Well, Danny has been working on Meal or No Meal.  So maybe we could work that into the contest as well.  Whop'em for Whoppers?  All right.  Use the answer for feedback.  I want an Opie and Anthony billboard with that fucking fat mess on it and a piggy mask. 
[02:42:30]  Got to just be a complete disaster.  It has to violate people.  Yeah.  It starts tomorrow.  We have to do this on Free FM because we have a much bigger audience.  We want to expose this contest to a lot of people, especially a lot of people in the New York area because we'll get a lot of contestants from New York.  So you come in.  It's guaranteed we'll give you $10 a pound if you're the winner.  That's a lot of money if you're a fatso.  So the contest ends Halloween, right around Halloween, okay?  I think we're going to be doing a party at the Hard Rock Cafe. 
[02:43:00]  And the winner can come out on stage and fall through it with any luck.  For the fat ladies listening out there, if you're a little shy, you can wear some kind of mask so we don't know who you are.  Change your name.  Change the town you're from.  You just have to come into the studio and get weighed, okay?  We will have a talent competition.  And we also, how are we going to do the girl that gains the most weight?  They have to show up right away, I guess.  Yeah, you have to show up.  Yeah, we would have to weigh them, have a weigh-in.  No, they could show up the day before.  You could put on 50 pounds in a day, good for you. 
[02:43:30]  Whenever they show up, the later they show up, the higher it is going to be for them.  Just one day's worth of putting weight on?  Oh, if they can only show up a day in advance, that's their problem.  Yeah, but then what are they going to do, put on 40 pounds in a day?  But if you weigh 400 pounds and then you gain one pound, you're pretty much winning.  Tony from Richmond, Virginia?  But you're winning the contest itself because you're a huge, big, disgusting fat pig.  Yeah, Tony from Richmond.  Miss Fat as the Universe.  Fat Pig Payoff is coming in. 
[02:44:00]  Willie from New York City.  The Chuck and Fubby Bowl.  No.  Oh, instead of the fucking Chubby Bowl.  Fucking Chubby Bowl.  Indy Mike, Cash Cows, Brian from Astoria, Pack the Porker.  Oh, boy.  How about the disgusting, slob, no self-control, mess, pig, cunt contest?  I like it.  It's a little wordy, but...  Do we have women showing up tomorrow? 
[02:44:30]  Will Sarah show up tomorrow?  Yes.  Yeah?  How about the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest?  Fatty Pig Fatty.  I love the dual use of Fatty Pig. 
[02:45:00]  Put that in your walk and smoke it.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Oh, god damn.  Brian from Astoria.  Pigs, hippos, elephants, oh my.  Oh, that is...  I don't know why.  It is so god damn funny.  It just sums it all up in a nice tidy package. 
[02:45:30]  Welcome to the Fatty Pig Fatty Contest.  And Jimmy, you know how you want to get the fat girl on a billboard and it promotes the  Opie and Anthony show?  How?  Well, Jim from Philly, here's a slogan for the ad with you and the fatty on the billboard.  Hogging up the airwaves.  Opie and Anthony, hogging up the airwaves.  Oh, it's beautiful.  Oh, that is good.  A fat girl in a bikini with a pig mask.  Pig mask.  Oh.  Hogging up the airwaves. 
[02:46:00]  I'm so happy.  Fucking Steve from Bayshore might have nailed the name.  What?  Steve's very good.  Well, you know how some radio stations do Rocktoberfest?  Yes.  Hogtoberfest.  Hogtober.  Hogtoberfest.  We're celebrating Hogtoberfest.  What do you think?  It's a little hacky.  A little bit?  Even though it fits the whole thing, it's goofing on something that's completely hacky.  It's funny, but it's too nice.  It's a little too nice.  Yeah? 
[02:46:30]  Don't take that as an insult there, Steve.  I'm writing it down.  Very funny.  Can I preview my contest now?  Okay.  A little preview.  Coming this fall.  Yeah.  Can I have an echo?  On an all-new Opie and Anthony.  An echo.  Yeah.  Look at Danny standing back there going, go fuck yourself.  Echo.  Echo.  Echo.  How about you talking to Travis's vagina?  Echo.  Maybe that'll give an echo.  Echo.  I can't look into my food without making a Travis joke. 
[02:47:00]  Echo.  Echo.  We want to sound like we're CBSFF.  That's right.  You're getting nothing.  Look, Danny doesn't know what to do.  No, of course he doesn't.  Echo.  Echo.  What's dumb Danny doing in there?  Nothing.  Anthony, could you do the big announcer voice and then I'll just say the name of the contest?  Can't do it without an echo.  Echo.  Echo.  Echo.  How about some movie music?  Oh, do we have some kind of fitting...  You know, like, it started in a small town.  Is that like a trailer or something for a new TV show that's coming? 
[02:47:30]  Coming this fall.  I like dramatic.  Is it funny?  Is it dramatic?  I like dramatic.  Is it wacky?  Ah, I'm more into the dramatization.  It's a love story that turns horribly wrong on Lifetime.  Wait, what's the choices?  I don't know.  It's like all different.  It depends on if it's drama, comedy, horror.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think, Jimmy?  What?  Oh, the contest from... 
[02:48:00]  Oh, that one that we were talking about.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  And then you come up with one.  Jimmy came up with one.  I came up with one.  And then Anthony's going to come up with one.  Damn me.  Do you have time, though?  I do have time.  Because we've got to get through these two contests.  This one...  No music for me?  I think ominous.  Yeah.  Ominous music.  I got some.  Yeah?  Gary Hoey?  Something ominous?  All right.  All right.  The, uh...  Whoa. 
[02:48:30]  Just a little ominous.  Rockin'.  Guaranteed you've never seen this before.  All right.  Do it, Ant.  Okay.  Coming this fall  to the Opie and Anthony show,  a contest so provocative  it cannot even be described.  We're done on regular radio. 
[02:49:00]  Sit back  as Opie describes to you  his idea,  his vision  for a contest  that will only be heard  on the Opie and Anthony program.  The XM version, by the way.  XM.  Are you ready?  Let her rip.  Coming soon  to the Opie and Anthony show  later this fall.  Yes.  Foaming pussy! 
[02:49:30]  That's right!  Foaming pussy  coming  to the Opie and Anthony show!  It's my vision!  And finally,  I get to do it!  Foaming pussy!  And to you motherfucking  bands out there,  don't steal that name  for your band.  I just saw  Foaming pussy  down the village.  It was a great band.  Foaming pussy  coming to the  Opie and Anthony show. 
[02:50:00]  Without all the details  you're given, right?  I would say yes for now.  You don't want that  one to be a story.  Yeah, yeah.  People steal our stuff.  Don't steal it.  Yeah, yeah.  They steal our stuff.  Thievery.  So maybe we should do  a dual contest.  Foaming fat pussy.  Foaming pussy  coming soon.  I love this idea too.  To the Opie and Anthony show.  That's great.  I say we do it right away.  Fuck it.  Yeah, I agree. 
[02:50:30]  Let's do it right now.  Fuck it.  Jimmy?  Because now that I even  said foaming pussy  someone's in a land  somewhere trying to  figure it out.  Someone will figure it out.  Okay.  Jim?  Foaming asshole.  Take your pants off.  You've got it.  I keep thinking  when that door opens  it's our soup  and then it's not.  Oh, Anthony,  what time is it?  Go ahead, go ahead.  Scold, Anthony.  Hey, what happened?  This just in.  What?  From Steve. 
[02:51:00]  What you guys  are actually naming it.  We might work off  the name Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  I love Fatty Pig Fatty.  It's just so awful.  I love Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  You know, I don't want  to take the thunder  away from Jimmy,  but I think we should  do a dual contest.  I don't.  I'm all.  The fat contest is  definitely going to be  more of a CBS  free FM thing.  It's not about me.  It's about  Dad!  Dad!  Dad!  You know, 
[02:51:30]  I have a contest  I did, dude.  But you know,  it's, you know,  dude.  No, we don't.  I'll get some feedback  this morning over there.  People are saying  they can't get enough  of you just doing  Bob Kelly's, dude.  It's just a pontificating  ass.  Do you do it  around the house now?  I do what?  It's another thing  I do around the house.  Yeah.  I just go,  dude, dude.  Dude, you know what?  You don't.  No, that's not the way  you think it, dude.  And now that he's got  the success  and he's doing big gigs  and oh, he's unbearable. 
[02:52:00]  I want to fucking  stab him.  You know, Dad,  they're trying to fuck me.  I got the back hand.  Stop trying to talk business.  He's talking like  he's a shaker,  like a mover and shaker.  Oh, my God.  The only thing that shakes  when he walks  is the fucking,  the little cups  that are balanced  inside the hutch.  He's a fucking,  a cup in the hutch shaker.  Oh, he bugs me.  You know, Dad,  I'm trying to book  the airfare,  but Dad,  they're trying to tell me  that you,  oh, shut up. 
[02:52:30]  Yes, Gary.  What about,  what about fat pigs  for fat cash?  No.  No.  Too long.  Too wordy?  Too long?  Not mean enough.  This is too long.  How about I try  to play the guitar?  How's that?  Straight up.  Let me try  to play the guitar  and  Does anybody  remember laughing?  It's out  Friday-wide. 
[02:53:00]  I gotta say,  Gary,  you are a guitar genius.  I'll stick to that.  I wasn't even  gonna say anything more.  I was just gonna say,  I've got his other albums.  Love listening to them.  Absolutely.  We're gonna listen  to this one  driving around.  Absolutely.  Gary Hoey,  American Made.  Pick that up.  I have another idea  for a contest name,  but it might be,  might not be too long.  Alright. 
[02:53:30]  Eat until your  cunt falls out.  Okay.  It's a little wordy.  You know,  we can work around it.  It's a little wordy,  but  I don't think  we're gonna  blue sky that one.  Alright.  Tee it up.  Fatty pig fatty  starts tomorrow.  Fatty tomorrow.  And to answer  your question,  Anthony,  my favorite  around the house  still is  when I'm doing  the tabless.  You know,  when I'm doing  the tabless,  it's different  than when I'm doing 
[02:54:00]  my exotic.  It's more freeing  doing the tabless.  Buxonic babes.  Alright.  Can I explain  foaming pussy?  Yeah,  we'll do this  immediately.  We should have a girl  in the week.  Now,  we need a girl  to do this.  Now,  yesterday during  the meeting  when we,  you know,  when you were,  you got a divine  light,  a spark,  when you were  struck by divine  lightning for this 
[02:54:30]  contest.  Thank you.  I've been doing  radio for over  20 years.  I'm glad you're  noticing the genius  that is me.  It's like foaming  pussy.  I have over the  years noticed  the genius  like foaming  pussy.  And thank God  during yesterday's  meeting,  we brought up  the fact that  perhaps more  of these things  should be incorporated  into the program.  Okay.  And again,  and it took  seconds.  I actually went  to school for this.  For Opie to be hit  with this divine 
[02:55:00]  light.  Thank you.  Yes.  Of an idea  for foaming  pussy.  And we could  do this today.  We need a girl.  Yes,  we need a girl.  This is the deal.  Foaming pussy.  Duct tape.  By now,  I think the faithful  listeners know  that I love  YouTube.  Anthony loves  the YouTube.  Jimmy loves  the YouTube.  Who doesn't?  It's the biggest  thing on the net  right now.  Have you checked  out the Diet Coke  and Mentos  experiments?  There are so many  Diet Coke and  Mentos experiments  I have seen  on YouTube.  You want to  explain the Diet Coke 
[02:55:30]  and Mentos experiment  to maybe the people  that don't check out  the videos online there.  In its simplest form,  it is a bottle  of Diet Coke,  one of those big  two liter bottles  of Diet Coke  and Mentos,  the breath mint.  you drop the Mentos  into the Diet Coke  and you get  rocket propulsion.  It comes  shooting out  of the Diet Coke  bottle  in a fountain  depending on  how much Diet Coke 
[02:56:00]  and how much Mentos  to 20 feet high  sometimes.  It's amazing.  Other things  that have been done  have been people  that have tried  to make jet packs  with them.  They've strapped  them to rollerblades  and tried to do that.  There are many uses  for this Diet Coke  Mentos rocket  propulsion thing.  One thing  that it does make  though is a lot  of foam  because it instantly  just foams up  the Diet Coke.  I don't think  I even have to say 
[02:56:30]  another word.  Foaming pussy.  Foaming pussy.  Something I've not  seen on YouTube  is one use  of Mentos  and Diet Coke.  Alka-Seltzer  but I think  we should go  the distance.  I agree.  It would entail  a woman  that is willing  to do this.  Right.  That is number one.  Maybe we just  maybe just a little bit  at first.  Maybe just a little  shot glass.  It would entail  her doing  some type of  headstand  handstand 
[02:57:00]  against the wall.  She would have  to be secured  upside down.  She would then  have to spread  her legs.  Diet Coke  would have to be  poured into  her vagina.  I can't make  the noise.  How did you do  the perfect noise?  How did you do  that Anthony?  I practice.  And then  We're doing  gulping sounds.  I know  and we thought  we were  a gulpa 
[02:57:30]  a gulpa  a gulpa  gulpa  gulpa  gulpa  and then  we add  the Mentos  and what you get  is something  akin to  maybe the  volcano experiment  from your  elementary school  days  but we like  to call it  Opie  the foaming pussy  the foaming pussy  that's right  to see  Diet Coke  foam  shooting out  of a woman  doing a  handstand  from her pussy 
[02:58:00]  could be  the greatest  thing ever  seen  I think  yeah  I say we  put panties  on the girl  so it could  make YouTube  and then have  it foaming  out the sides  out the sides  that could be  one take  because we got  to get some  kind of foaming  pussy  one for safety  that'll be one  for safety  and then one  so I asked  this question  today  is there a  woman out there  willing to do  foaming pussy  ASAP 
[02:58:30]  I don't want  to hear any  doctors calling  yeah we tested  this in the lab  Diet Coke  is fine  with any  orifice you  put it in  Diet Coke  and a mento  in your mouth  what would  happen  nothing  it would  probably come  out your nose  and look  really silly  I mean  it really  does  foam up  yeah  it's just  a foamy  now Pop Rocks  and Coke  is dangerous  because that's  what killed  Mikey  that's right  from the  of course  it didn't  shut up  Dan were you  for a second  correcting me  not for real  oh god  okay 
[02:59:00]  Charlie in  Richmond  sometimes I  can't tell  when you're  being sarcastic  it's 24 hours  a day  Charlie  hey boys  how you doing  hey Charlie  how you doing  I didn't hear  that you don't  surf  what  if you're  interested  in what's  going to  happen  put mentos  and Diet Coke  in your mouth  that is uploaded  on YouTube  right of course  it is  there are some  people that have  done it  in their mouth  yeah  and there's  this one guy  who's bald  who shoots himself  up against a garage  doing it  it's pretty funny  this boys  is it  you can get  off the radio  it's the funniest  fucking bit 
[02:59:30]  you've ever  come up with  say people  already  enjoying  we find  the volunteer  that's right  we want to do  this  we'll stay  late to do it  if you can  find a girl  today  we do it  today  we need a girl  to do the  foaming pussy  tell Steve  to call  I'm willing  to buy her  soup  I like that  by the way  the video  that Charlie's  talking about  we got up  online  oh my god  yeah nothing's  going to happen  to the girl 
[03:00:00]  guy did it  with his mouth  it was pretty funny  turn the video  screen around  a little bit  let's see  he  he's got  the Mentos  in his mouth  one Mentos  right  he takes  a swig  of the Diet Coke  he's laughing  right  there you go  and it foams  all out his mouth  not too much  but  that's all  that's a lot of  foam  and it wasn't  in an environment  that kind of  acts like a  gun barrel  right  a rocket engine  so we need  a combustion chamber 
[03:00:30]  right  which would be  your stink hole  I believe the area  just south  of the cervix  would act as  the combustion chamber  all right  yeah  so far  no one's calling  should she wear  a diaphragm  to keep it  from backing  into her uterus  that's up to her  yeah we don't care  about the fucking  inner plumbing  I don't either  as long as the lips  are meaty  you can have 
[03:01:00]  fucking old books  in there  for all I care  fucking dusty  old chest books  I think  to save the inner organs  she's got to be  kind of  maybe sitting up  or standing up  and she has to  hold it all inside  until the moment  of fun  why save the inner organs  what would happen  no I don't know  I was just  did you dump  Diet Coke  into a box  it should be fine  I think her cervix  should be  enough of a seal  there  to keep  anything out  Dr. Anthony  I have a microphone  in front of me 
[03:01:30]  the cervix  you see  will seal  because the opening  the vaginal opening  is really going to be  where this  pressure  ends up coming out  you know what  a woman's vagina  not unlike  a ramjet engine  so I think  someone's trying to say  they try this  on Mythbusters  shut up  they're not doing  foaming pussy  Mythbusters  Mythbusters  dorky Don  Don  yes guys  good morning  I just wanted to let you know  they were doing all sorts  of experiments  on Mythbusters  but as soon as that 
[03:02:00]  Mentos touches  the Diet Coke  you're going to have  a reaction  so  yeah we know  oh  shut up  oh you  boring  idiot  that doesn't even  understand what  we're talking about  they did it on Mythbusters  they took Mentos  and Coke  and mixed them  did they  in a woman's vagina  we need a girl  to come down  immediately  to do  foaming pussy  alright  people want to call this  the Fatty Arbuckle Challenge  and then  tomorrow  Fatty Pig Fatty 
[03:02:30]  starts  Fatty Pig Fatty  looking forward to it  can you tell  we finally decided  to do a creative meeting  it only took a year  bunch of assholes  we hashed out  a few things  yesterday  after the show  we sure did  we hashed out  some things  you're going to hear  a different attitude  as we move forward  little bit  little bit  we're going to  we're going to  adjust the course  of the ship  that's all  alright  we'll take a break  when we get back  we'll see if any girls  are going to do  the foaming pussy  on the Opie and Anthony show  but first  Gary Hoey

Yeah, finally singing, man.  That is really, really good.  Thank you.  That's a great version of Lunatic Fringe by Red Ryder, right?  Yes, Red Ryder, yeah.  I played that song a few times in my life.  Everyone loves that song when it comes on.  You've got to keep it on, you know.  What's the big plug again? 
[03:08:30]  We've got the new CD, American Made, and we're touring all over the country, so if anybody  wants to go to GaryHoey.com, they can check out tour dates and stuff.  Right on.  Okay.  Let's say hi to Rhonda.  Rhonda, what's up?  Hey, how are you?  Hi.  Hi, Rhonda.  Hey, Rhonda.  Hi, Rhonda.  No, it's Help Me, Rhonda, you know?  I know that song.  How are you, Rhonda?  Good.  I just wanted to tell you, I saw your commercial on Letterman last night.  It was great.  Oh, very nice. 
[03:09:00]  Nice.  There you go.  I was very excited.  I have to tell you, I work in the evenings, and I get home just in time for Letterman,  and I put it on, which I saw you on there last week, which was terrific.  And then, all of a sudden, you see this fat girl with these legs, and I'm like,  Yeah, the video's up on YouTube.  All right.  See, it's an attention getter right from the start, because you see the fat girl.  There you go.  Thank you, Rhonda.  Which one was it?  Oh, she's gone.  Dammit.  You can check out the commercial on YouTube.  I know it wasn't the ass one. 
[03:09:30]  Not if it was on CBS.  We got to say hi to Blowfly, actually.  Blowfly.  This is not Blowfly.  Where is Blowfly?  He'll be here in a minute.  Do you remember the last time you went to the bathroom to take a shit?  Uh, yes.  Yep.  Well, I'm not sure if you shit it.  This is the motherfucking Blowfly.  Nah, I know.  You ain't bullshitting me.  You ain't bullshitting me.  Shit, don't talk.  I do. 
[03:10:00]  Boy, I've been around.  You're Blowfly.  I've been in the asses of all DJs and women and men.  I'm totally committed.  I was born out of an evil shitted.  I'm the Irish Pirates and computer spam.  You pirate jocks ain't shit, but that's exactly what I am.  I'm brown.  I'm gold.  Come from deep within you, junk asshole.  You find my ground underneath your feet, but I get all that bullshit you eat.  Here's Blowfly.  I love the Blowfly.  Okay, hear me. 
[03:10:30]  It smells like shit in here, guys.  Y'all un-shitted?  I love the Blowfly.  Hey, uh, Mr. Blowfly.  Yeah.  We've been listening to your shit.  That is some fucked up shit.  What year did you put that out?  What year you talking about?  Well, a lot of people saying that you did the first rap song.  I did it in 1959.  And, uh, Henry Stone had this friend named Dick Clark.  I call him Dick Clark.  You might have heard of him.  Dick Clark.  Yeah, the nastiest piece of shit they ever heard, and they wasn't going to put it out. 
[03:11:00]  I found out later Dick Clark had banned Hank Ballard's record, Work With Me, Annie.  I don't know if you remember.  So, uh, I recorded the criteria.  They put it out in Germany.  1965, they started to enter a bitch and a bitch.  I thought we'd trust each other.  I said, you remember you and Sid Nathan told me, when you turn somebody down or a bitch turn you down, you're free to do what you wanted.  They all said it was a piece of shit.  Now, did they like it in Germany?  Well, they loved it.  I ended up working over there, and I went back and ate this record out called The First Black President, where I get hit from the secretary and all kind of shit. 
[03:11:30]  Later on, Clinton and Monica Lewinsky did it.  They thought in Germany the president copied me.  He didn't.  It was just a coincidence.  So I went over there and worked and was wild and weird nasty.  They used to see guys coming over there talking about it.  Yo, kick back.  Fuck.  Oh, bitch.  And they're supposed to be nasty.  And they were shocked. 
[03:12:00]  I don't know what Bluefly is talking about.  Motherfuckers and cock-sullers.  Do you got any?  No clue.  No clue.  No clue.  I thought about now I'm thinking this was a bad idea.  But, uh...  Well, the first rap you wrote, what was the name of it?  Not a clue.  A lot of people you get to use it and say, there was no hippies in the 50s.  Bullshit.  I was with them.  All right.  Well, not a lot of hippies.  You couldn't tell the girls from the guys in the hippies.  So I wrote this song called Oddball. 
[03:12:30]  Somewhere in the land, a woman and a man sinks into the wood.  Bet they have no good.  Why nobody knows them?  That's what often goes for the woods, I think.  If that's where they get the kick, it seems very odd.  You can holler, tell them apart.  They both have beard.  So it's weird.  Mr. Bluefly.  Oh, you're actually going to try to engage him, Frank?  A guy named Stitch, but which one is which?  Call him the Oddball, the Oddball.  The monster got on hard, y'all.  I'm a good rapper.  I wrote a song. 
[03:13:00]  It was bigger.  Mr. Bluefly, I have a question for you.  My name's Frank.  Hi, Stank.  Oh, you mean Frank.  I'm sorry.  Yes, Frank.  I've enjoyed many of your music.  What do you find to be the most inspirational thing when writing some songs?  My inner Georgia, I tried to make it past.  Seven years old, my granddaddy died.  And they put me in the field flying a mule.  So to get in the white people.  The year were you born.  Yeah, to get in the white people's mind, I like to get in your mind. 
[03:13:30]  I wait until the cracker was around me and I started singing, I'm jerking my dick over you.  I keep telling myself it ain't true.  Jerk did so much till the hair turned black and blue.  Jerking my dick over you.  Open up, crack a gal now.  And they would laugh and call me a dirty nigger and give me money.  Wow.  My grandmother, the way a blowfly come up.  You're like Weird Al Yankanig.  My grandmother heard this out of the worst disgrace ever heard than the disgrace to the black raisin name. 
[03:14:00]  Really?  Can you sing?  I don't know what a blowfly was till later.  Yeah, what the fuck is a blowfly?  That, uh, look, you're on, born of 30 to 14, just like me.  White girl, except she was seven years older than me.  She looked it up in the book.  It's a black, red, green, and white insect to lay eggs on dead things.  Ah.  They turn into maggots and screw one.  Oh, well, that is nasty.  And eat up your turd and your rotten dick.  You into the, you into the white bitches or the black bitches?  Uh, long as they are nice. 
[03:14:30]  I don't like freaky bitches.  I like the nice, innocent little girls.  Not young now.  I'm not like, oh, boring.  I'm slimy and I'm sick.  I'll kill you and come bonnie or someone ought to chomp off your dick.  Could you write a rap about me?  My name is Frank.  I frown a lot.  I have a genetic disfiguration.  And people make fun of me.  I'm not finished.  My name is Frank the Frowner.  And I hate to be called that, but that's what mother calls me. 
[03:15:00]  I heard your name would stink because you won't eat a bitch who is taking us.  I'll go home and get you a fucking shine box.  Hey, where are the white women at?  Blow fly stinks.  That's what hang around me.  I always draw a white on it.  The white women?  Yeah, that's what I do.  Yeah.  They want to get back at their daddy's.  Have rappers credited you at all? 
[03:15:30]  Like guys who are modern rappers, have they credited you at all?  Yeah, there you go.  That's a good question.  All modern hip-hop guys, they give you any credit?  Of course not.  They're scared.  Why are they scared?  Let's start.  Yeah, I had to tell something before I met Tom and Crystal, the guys I was working with.  Now, there's some sort of what?  But he did it.  You don't want to come kick back and chill with us?  That's terrible.  I'm sorry.  That's terrible.  Stick it up your nigga ass.  That's my problem.  You're in my fucking house. 
[03:16:00]  Let's start from the beginning.  What was the name of the first rap song that Blowfly did?  Did he say the name of the first rap song?  It was Art Balls, and behind it I did Rap Dirty.  It was released in Austria, Vienna.  Did you update Rap Dirty?  Yeah, and they found out about it in 65 over here, and it finally got it running.  Yeah.  Well, I'm out.  You updated Rap Dirty after the Sugar Hill Gang, right?  Yeah.  Just to kind of make a little bit more.  Actually, Art Balls was the first.  You made it like a little bit more consumer-friendly after Sugar Hill Gang, 
[03:16:30]  because you saw the success that that was having, right?  Oh, no.  I was at my podium.  Like you said, I was doing that shit weird before the end.  Oh, no, no, no.  I used to do that shit, and I'm in Nashville.  My nigga, Go Real Paul, my bad nigga, John Ha.  I got a 48-inch stick.  I'm Alan Pree.  That shit I did in 52.  I mean, you can see how a white girl can fall for him.  I mean, didn't you, like, after you released it, didn't, like, the Sugar Hill Gang come out years later,  and then you just did a version of yours where you updated the music a little bit? 
[03:17:00]  Yeah, yep.  You're absolutely 100% right, because I got a record on a 78 from Frankfurt, Germany.  I'm not, you know what a 70, you know you.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Fans don't know what a, it's over here back in the 50s.  Who do you like now as a rapper?  I'm trying.  Oh, my favorite ones is Ice Cube, Ice T, and a white guy I never heard of, love the guy.  I mean, I heard him a long time, Vanilla Ice.  Vanilla Ice.  Oh, that guy, he was a little too edgy, though. 
[03:17:30]  Ice Ice Baby.  Open up the window, there goes credibility.  You don't like Eminem?  Well, I like Eminem, he sampled me.  And that's what I had to do with this award.  I was telling him about, if y'all are rich and I'm the ditch, then why is he sampling me?  He did the song, y'all stand up, you listen to it.  Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.  Hey, we have Uncle Tom on board?  Well, if you listen to one of my records from 19...  Uncle Tom.  Uncle Tom, say hello, everybody. 
[03:18:00]  Hold on there, Blowfly, we got Uncle Tom on the phone.  Yeah.  I'm Uncle, I'm, I'm Mr. Blowfly's head cracker.  How are you motherfuckers doing this morning?  Well, we were doing well.  You were?  And then, and then you let us on your show, and we're fucking it up.  And God damn it, it's the best thing that's ever happened to you.  Blowfly, do you know Uncle Tom?  Yeah, they're, uh...  Well, you know, I do.  I was in Chicago with fishbone and pot of chili peppers.  And this little unpotty trained cracker was like,  Yeah, do this!  What the fuck is this?  That was Tom and his future wife, Linus. 
[03:18:30]  I admit it.  Yeah, see what happened is,  I made the mistake of going to see this motherfucker in Chicago.  And my wife said,  Do we have to be up front?  And I made the mistake of saying,  I need to get the full Blowfly experience.  And here I am touring the world with this gasp,  with this bastard, three years later.  Except for what you wish for.  Yeah, but you're a crack-ass cracker.  That's right, I am a cracker-ass cracker.  I'm the world's baddest cracker.  He's the world's baddest knicker.  All right, TWBN. 
[03:19:00]  TWBN?  Yes, the world's baddest knicker.  Way to go there, Norton.  Oh, they know you!  Uncle Tom!  Oh, God.  Nothing's gonna get done.  Oh, boy.  They know you.  Uncle Tom knows you.  You were a baddest knicker.  I'll scare him off.  You're right.  How does Uncle Tom know me?  You hung up? 
[03:19:30]  Jesus H. Christ.  All right.  You know something?  The one Blowfly song, I love them.  Maybe we'll do a take two in a minute or two.  The idea of having Blowfly on was much better than the actual having on of the Blowfly,  the fly of the Blow variety.  Yeah, I kind of wanted to ask him some real questions. 
[03:20:00]  Yeah, you were giving it a whirl, Jim.  You want to know.  It's more interesting.  I saw you peddling.  You were peddling your little heart out right there.  We got a fat girl on the line.  Marilyn from Illinois.  Hey, guys.  I was a long-time listener,  and I was wanting to comment on the whole fat contest.  No, it's called Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Mario Fat-Ass.  Nice.  What did you want to comment on?  You have to say the name of the contest.  I was just saying that you guys are, like,  a really bad influence on personal image. 
[03:20:30]  You didn't say the name of the contest.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  Fatty Pig Fatty.  It's fun.  It rolls off the tongue.  It's fast.  It's funny because it uses fatty twice.  Now, what are you saying?  That you think it's bad for personal image?  Why?  I think it's bad for personal image because, I mean,  it just makes people feel bad.  Well, how, how, not to be disrespectful,  but how disgustingly fat a pig are you?  Uh, uh-uh.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[03:21:00]  How big a gal?  Okay.  Now, I have it coming to me.  I know you guys are going to make comments.  No, we're not.  No, no.  No, see, we, this is where, no.  Hey, Marilyn, this is where we surprise people.  We actually could take a serious angle on stuff like this.  463.  463.  No, wait, no, no.  Yeah.  That has, you had to be giving out your phone number. 
[03:21:30]  No, no, no, no.  I've been big since I was 12.  463.  But just because I'm 463 doesn't mean I'm on the show all day.  Doesn't mean you're on the show all day.  Are you 68 feet tall?  No.  Then you're a bit overweight.  I'm 68.  And I said I would make no comments,  but I didn't promise I wouldn't make animal noises.  I feel sorry for the left side of your car. 
[03:22:00]  Jimmy, can I ask you one question?  You sure can.  Okay, you're the one that came up with this contest, right?  Yes.  Yes.  Blame it on Jim.  Have you ever received a blowjob from a fat girl?  No, I won't even let them talk to me.  Nice.  Well, maybe you should try it before you knock it.  No, I'm not into that.  Because I like to run my hands over a girl's body.  And it would be nothing more frightening than putting your cock in some place that is just 
[03:22:30]  chewing all day long.  What if she has a fucking Charms blowpop flashback?  What if she's chewing?  What if she's trying to get to that Tootsie Roll center?  What if my fat, delicious cock just reminds her of something that she...  What if all of a sudden she thinks of a corn dog while she's got a finger in my rectum  and she's soiling my cock with her dirty Twinkie lips?  By the way, if you...  There, you're twisted.  By the way, if you've been to the contest, you could walk away with $4,000. 
[03:23:00]  Yeah, there you go.  Now, that's something to think about, huh?  Imagine how many Big Macs.  I'm in Illinois.  And your face would not have to be on the internet at all.  No, you wear a little piggy mask because you're a little piggy.  Someone wants to know if 463 is the number of hugs you get a day to make yourself feel better.  Actually, I'm one of your friends on MySpace, so if you want, you can actually go look at my pictures.  I'm not...  Okay.  I don't look like I'm 463.  What do you look like? 
[03:23:30]  You're 350?  Jesus.  30,000 friends on MySpace.  Wait, what is your...  Search fee just stinks.  Wait, let's go to MySpace right now.  She'll give us her address.  Hold on, Ann.  Get on.  All right, let me go.  What's your MySpace address?  Uh-oh.  September Child 83.  September Child 83.  All right, so you were born in September of 83, which was the...  23 years ago?  Wait, wait, wait.  September Child 83?  Yes.  Number 83.  Oh, oh, oh.  Yes.  I was doing an 8-8 joke. 
[03:24:00]  Oh, I didn't get that.  Nice.  8-3-1.  Bison?  Right.  I was waiting for the answer, and then I was going to ask her why, but yeah, it just...  Wow.  Once again.  You are.  It's cute.  Yeah.  I've actually been a...  You're a roomie.  Wow.  Thank you.  All right, I see you.  I see you with a baby.  I see you.  I see you with a dog.  I see you.  Are those two kids that you ate?  The MySpace picture stinks. 
[03:24:30]  No, they're my nephews.  Oh, they're your nephews?  You can't tell she's 463.  Yeah.  According to one of her MySpace pictures.  She...  It says here, though, look, I enjoy dancing and making new friends,  and I enjoy dining out at my favorite Plankin' restaurant.  No, it doesn't say that.  I enjoy buying shoes and having barnacles scraped off me.  Marilyn, just join the contest.  You could possibly win.  You could win almost...  I know I could win, but...  Do your shoe heels wear away like pencil erasers when you walk? 
[03:25:00]  No.  No?  Actually, I'm pretty active for a big girl.  Are you?  Yeah.  What do you do that's active?  I walk to the fridge a hundred times a day.  Tried to get out of a tar pit.  Yeah, they're getting funnier by the minute.  Yeah, I know.  I see a picture of you.  It looks like it's a younger picture of you in a little plaid skirt.  And interesting and coincidentally enough and ironically, you're wearing pigtails. 
[03:25:30]  Yes.  Hey, I see you...  I was 21 in that picture.  Oh, 21?  I see you holding a baby.  Did he even know you were pregnant?  That's not my baby.  That's my sister's baby.  Oh, you haven't had a baby yet?  I don't have any.  Of course.  You might be carrying quads.  No, no, no.  Sips.  Oh, you know, that could be my excuse.  I could be three years pregnant.  That could be.  I've heard that before.  See, I have a sense of humor about my weight as well. 
[03:26:00]  It's not...  You know, I'm not highly sensitive about it.  You certainly do.  How can you not?  Why don't you come in for the contest?  We actually will be nice to you if you come in.  You'd be surprised.  I would, but I can't.  Yeah, we'll call the Teamsters so they can get you over here.  Well, I don't know.  For five grand, isn't it worth it to buy a plane ticket and come here?  I can't sit in plane seats.  So buy two seats.  Fly on Southwest and buy two seats.  Hey, wait a minute.  Underneath your little montage of pictures where it says, 
[03:26:30]  Welcome to MySpace, you have a whole bunch of stuff that's written down.  Uh-huh.  You're 23?  Yes.  You love to read.  Sometimes...  I cry more now than I used to.  Something like that?  Yeah, it's been a hard year for me.  So do your floors.  Is that true?  And then there's a great picture.  Why don't you use this one?  There's underneath that, there's a great picture of you.  Which one is that?  Right underneath all that text.  Oh, I'm sorry.  It's a tractor trailer. 
[03:27:00]  Are you a trucker?  Yes, I am, actually.  Okay.  I'm sorry.  I thought that was, uh, because it's very pretty.  So why don't you drive here?  Because I'm on a dedicated route.  All right.  Yeah, but I didn't take a day off and drive here for fucking five grand?  I can't do that.  I'll get fired.  Do you actually drive it or do you ride in the back?  No, I drive it.  Oh, okay.  I'm a driver.  All right.  Oh, that's nice.  Well, you don't like the contest. 
[03:27:30]  Well, we're doing the contest.  In order to make the fucking, when you, when you get pulled in, you have to pull into those  like weigh stations for the truck.  In order to make, to stay underweight, do you have to haul like an empty trailer with  like two pieces of loose leaf paper in it?  Perhaps a paper clip?  The fact that an overweight trailer would weigh more than 80,000 pounds?  No, not really.  All right.  Listen, um, you don't like the contest or you do like it?  Um, I don't.  Shut up.  I like it for the fact that you're bringing more attention to the big girls, but I don't  like it for the fact that a lot of people are going to be, you know, posting messages 
[03:28:00]  and making comments.  No, hold on.  You, you lost a lot of weight from what I see here.  Bringing more attention.  Like you can hide.  Because it says, it says graduated 2000.  So you dropped, uh, what, how much is that?  I can't do math real quick.  30 pounds.  That would be, uh, 1,537 pounds.  1,537 pounds.  Okay.  I think honestly the only one that's the halfway good looking out of the three of you is probably 
[03:28:30]  Opie.  Yeah.  Opie is actually very good looking.  He's not halfway good looking.  Opie's the handsome one.  He's very good looking.  Anthony does impressions and I got a big cock.  What do you say about them apples?  Wait, let me rephrase that.  What do you say about them inedible things?  We all take lemons and make lemonade.  Yes.  Exactly.  We all take lemons and make lemon ring pie.  Oh, damn it.  You beat me to it.  Let's just let me play.  I was just, I was just tossing that up for anybody that would have swung away and Jimmy 
[03:29:00]  swung.  I was loaded.  I was swinging at the same time.  What are you doing?  You're sad.  I take lemons and I eat cheesecake.  Do you?  Marilyn.  I actually like cheesecake.  Of course you do.  Of course you do.  Boy.  I love cheesecake.  It would have been a surprise if you said I like celery.  Yeah.  Or if you looked at lettuce and recognized it.  I do like celery.  Recognize.  You don't like celery.  It's just the sound your floorboards make when you're walking on them. 
[03:29:30]  Aww.  Oh, we're sorry.  See, you're getting a little, but at first you're like, see, I got a sense of humor,  but you chip away, you chip away, and it's starting to get to you.  Yeah.  What do you do?  No, I'm cool.  What do you do on New Year's Eve?  Yeah, that's a good idea.  What do I do on New Year's Eve?  Good question.  Yes.  I get drunk.  Cool.  What does everybody do?  Yeah.  And yes, it's light beer, for those of you that are thinking of that.  Why bother at this point with the light beer?  Just swallow the bottle whole.  What?  So you're not 483? 
[03:30:00]  Let me ask you, sweetheart.  What are you going to be for Halloween?  I actually don't dress up for Halloween.  Why?  Because it's hard for me to walk around the neighborhood.  No, because I just don't.  It's a kid thing.  I see you got a song playing on your webpage from the band Everlast.  Yes, I love Everlast.  What's the song?  What song?  What it's like.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Did the lyrics mean something?  That's a good song.  Okay.  Did the lyrics mean something to you? 
[03:30:30]  What it's like to be funny.  It does mean stuff to me because it's like, instead of, well, it's kind of similar to this  situation.  And instead of judging people, you just, you know, you think about what it would be like  to be in there.  What's Everlast is what food never does in her house?  It's Neverlast.  What, what, what is, um, uh, what, what is, uh, tell me, tell me something.  Well, no, she likes Everlast because it reminds her of herself because she's a heavy bag. 
[03:31:00]  Oh, I love you too, Jimmy.  I'm just teasing you.  I had to do wordplay.  Yeah.  Well, tell me some of the lyrics and what they mean to you.  Like, if I listen to certain Aussies or Sabbath songs, I can recite the lyrics.  Tell me some of the lyrics and what they mean to you.  Um, well, there's the second verse, uh, goes, Mary got pregnant by a kid named Thomas that  he was in love.  Um, so don't worry about a thing, baby, cause I'm the man you've been dreaming of.  Um, how does that tie into you?  Uh, well, like I said, during the past year, I've actually been into a relationship before 
[03:31:30]  and, and he kind of lied to me a lot and it just, it reminds me of that.  And I don't know.  What happened to this fella?  What happened to him?  Um, well, there is two in the past year that kind of screwed me over.  I was actually driving team when I first started driving trucks with, um, my ex-boyfriend  who was Jeff.  And honestly, Jeff was about 160 pounds and no, I didn't break him. 
[03:32:00]  What happened to him?  And, um, is he still in you somewhere?  No, uh, actually what happened was, uh, my company wrote him up for something that he  did not do.  And one day he was driving.  What, bestiality?  Yeah, that's funny.  No, he was driving and I came up front and I asked him what was going on and he said,  I'm quitting the company and I'm quitting you too.  Oh.  Oh boy.  Oh no.  So he was just putting trucks out of his life for good. 
[03:32:30]  Oh, well, see, I don't know.  Yeah.  I don't know.  He was an asshole anyway.  Okay.  What happened to your other boyfriend?  Um, that would have been Scott.  Okay.  What happened?  I don't like talking about Scott.  Well, just give us a little insight on Scott.  Uh, we talked for three weeks on the phone.  We met through, uh, his aunt who was a friend of mine and we talked for three weeks on the  phone.  And then when we met, the first day we hung out, watched movies, you know, kissed, cuddled, 
[03:33:00]  all that stuff.  Oh.  And then the second day we spent the entire day, you know, doing the nasty.  And after that, he didn't want to, he, he didn't call me anymore.  And I asked him what was going on and he basically told me that he was using me and he said, he  said, um, I'm throwing you out like the trash you are.  So he was introduced to you by your, his aunt's a friend of yours, right? 
[03:33:30]  Uh, yeah.  What, what, what, what, what tipped you off?  Your name is Marilyn, right?  Yes.  What tipped you off that it wasn't even work out?  Like when the aunt said, Scott, this is Marilyn.  And then the state of shaking your hand, he turned around and just punched her right in  the face.  Actually, no, he likes big women.  I mean, I like bigger than me.  Food.  All right.  Food.  All right. 
[03:34:00]  Food.  All right.  Food.  All right.  Food.  All right.  Food.  All right.  Wow.  See, she likes a lot of food.  Yeah.  Marilyn.  Yes.  No, you know, we're just teasing you.  Marilyn.  Oh, I know.  I know.  I don't take it.  I really don't take it.  Cigars and Scotch wants to know, why should we walk a mile in Hershey's?  When she never has.  Actually, that's not true.  If you look at Lincoln's challenge in Rantoul, I graduated from there.  That's a military school.  And I did that when I was two hundred and thirty-five. 
[03:34:30]  What were you, the tank?  Yeah.  You're funny.  Yeah.  Sometimes.  Oh, my God.  Wait.  Wait.  Did they?  When you were in military school to do exercises, would they make you lay in a puddle and pretend  you were Iwo Jima?  No.  They didn't.  No.  I don't have a comeback for that one.  I'm trying.  I know.  All right, Marilyn.  We're bored with you.  But you gave us.  But you were entertaining for a while. 
[03:35:00]  Yeah.  And then you got bored.  So like that boyfriend, we're throwing you out like the trash that you are.  I'm teasing, of course.  Did that really hurt when Scott said that, right?  It must have.  You thought you had found some love because you were hugging and cuddling.  So you decided to have sex with him because it was special and he really hurt you.  Oof.  Yeah.  He was a chubby chaser.  You know that, right?  Yeah.  I know that.  And actually, there's men out there that prefer big women.  Oh, there's a guy, Tim, that wants to have sex with you.  Oh.  Chubby chaser? 
[03:35:30]  What do you think?  No, I'm not a whore.  No one said you're not being a whore.  He might be a nice guy.  He might spark up a nice relationship.  Tim, talk to Marilyn.  Well, then he could message me on MySpace and I'll see if I'm interested.  Oh, here he is.  Here he is.  Hey, Marilyn, you sound really cute.  Do you like thin guys?  Do I like what guys?  Thin.  Thin guys?  Yeah.  You know, a guy under 400.  Well, I just...  Well, why don't you say if you're fat? 
[03:36:00]  I just thought...  Marilyn, I just thought you sounded really cute and you sound really cute.  I drive truck, too.  I'm 220.  I'm 6'2".  I just like big girls.  Well, thank you.  You know, there's guys out there that are fans of us.  When Marilyn committed a crime, the detective referred to her M.O.  And by that, he meant morbid obesity.  Oh, hey, see, guys, you don't know where it's at.  Them big girls. 
[03:36:30]  Big girls are fun.  Tim, there's not a shovel big enough.  We know where it's at.  But when you're done...  So, hey, you've got to...  Throw it into a gravel pit.  You're going to need a back hole.  Hey, if I give you guys my phone number, will you give it to her off air?  Yes.  All right, hold on a lot.  You really want to...  Hold on.  Yeah.  Marilyn, keep in touch, all right?  I will, absolutely.  I'm a big fan of the show.  You guys are doing great.  I'm sorry we were meaning you, Marilyn.  I'm just tired.  You know what I say? 
[03:37:00]  I've been big since I was 12, and if you guys come up with something new, let me know.  She's heard it all.  All right.  How about a diet?  Yeah, how about this?  A one look in the mirror that isn't filled with shame and self-hatred.  How about a calorie counter?  Well, you know what, Jimmy?  Maybe if I...  Should we continue?  Maybe if you kind of influenced me by looking at me every day, I would definitely run away  screaming from you, even if you were holding cheesecakes.  There you go.  So, all right, you got me.  So, but that's not the issue.  The issue is all the self-hatred and loneliness. 
[03:37:30]  Why don't you stop appeasing that with food and start dealing with why it is you hate yourself  and why you're so afraid to face whatever it is you're afraid to face?  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  I don't hate myself.  You should.  Uh, what has led you during this conversation to believe that I hate myself?  Uh, four, a six, and a three, back-to-back.  Well, maybe...  And a belly-to-belly.  You can't even...  You can't even rearrange those three numbers to make it look good.  No.  There's no order to make you go with that. 
[03:38:00]  There's none unless we throw in a decimal point.  Why does the soundboard say, fatty, pig, fatty?  Did Derek write fatty, pig, fatty on the bandana?  I'm sure he spelled it wrong.  Yes.  That intern is a dead man.  Farty, pig, farty.  All right, Marilyn, thank you.  Thank you, Marilyn.  All right.  Thanks for being the butt of all the jokes.  Oh, wow.  That's all right.  All right, Marilyn.  No, it's not.  Okay, you guys, take it easy. 
[03:38:30]  All right.  No, it's not all right.  Okay.  She looks like a giant filet mignon.  Where's the fucking guy with our soup?  Jeff in Florida.  Jeff?  Hey.  Where the fuck is he?  All three of you guys had lines of the day.  OB, that nice little one where she said, well, I can't get over there.  And you said, oh, we'll get the Teamsters to bring you over.  And then Anthony says, Everlast, that's something in your house that the food never does.  And then Jim Norton, she said, oh, I drink light beer. 
[03:39:00]  And Jimmy says, why bother?  Just drink the whole bottle.  No, sir, I said swallow the whole bottle.  Swallow the whole bottle.  Just drink the bottle.  Boy, that would be a real jab at her.  The line of the day competition is fierce today.  When you have gold like that on the phone, how can you lose?  By the way, the line of the day is going to be, why did somebody fucking decapitate the intern?  45 minutes to bring some fucking turkey stew.  Come on, I'm hungry. 
[03:39:30]  Sucker.  All right, Keith in Jersey.  Keith.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, Keith.  Hey, question.  With this contest, is there a point system or like a curve?  So if I bring in someone who's a little less, like say 250, but has Down syndrome, do I get anything for that?  Oh, my God.  Yeah, a first class ticket to hell.  Wow.  Well, you can bring that freak of nature in and then they can do the football picks for me.  How do you know?  Do you really know someone like that, honestly?  No, you don't.  Of course not. 
[03:40:00]  You can't.  I don't want somebody to retire that.  That wouldn't be nice.  I don't want that.  Hey, Jim Farts on the elevator.  I'm working for us.  My joke stunk, by the way.  I said a first class ticket to hell.  What am I?  Oh, bad sitcom.  First class ticket to hell.  Hey, hey.  Jimmy farted in the elevator and our soup has arrived.  All right, let's fart in this guy.  Farts or soup?  What happened?  What happened, man?  It just takes a long time.  I was going to give it all staff. 
[03:40:30]  That's why.  All right.  Oh, yeah.  We're not special.  Here comes the soup.  All he wanted was beet soup.  Thank you.  It took so long because they couldn't see him at the counter.  Ten spot back.  Ninety dollars worth of soup.  Thank you.  Those bastards.  Yeah, we want it right now.  Yeah, what do you think?  We're hungry.  We're eating on the air.  That's what we do here now.  Thank you.  Don't touch mine or my spoon.  Listen, can we play Jim Farts in the elevator from earlier?  Yes.  Let's hear that.  After the walk over, we all got into an elevator, and this is what happened. 
[03:41:00]  Listen as he hands out the soup there, Jimmy, okay?  Okay.  Why don't you stop moving the bags around there?  All right, hold.  Oh, brother.  I don't see a lot of soup.  I'll wait for you.  Go ahead.  I'll wait for when you're done.  Apples and bread.  The fuck?  The fuck?  I'm just looking for soup here.  Who's got my soup?  Soup and a spoon and a cherry.  Oh, why don't we just play that clip?  Play the clip. 
[03:41:30]  I think that'll be fine.  What did he buy?  Smalls?  How small is that soup?  It's a funny clip.  Here it is.  All right.  That was a full elevator.  Jimmy farting.  Honestly, it's XM today.  You just hear me laughing like a complete idiot.  Yeah.  Always laugh at Jimmy farting in a nice shot glass full of soup here. 
[03:42:00]  How about a spoon for my soup?  Hey, guess who's back?  Oh, Blowfly.  Blowfly.  Yes?  All right.  Enjoying some turkey chili here while we talk to you.  Yeah.  Anyway, guys, can I ask you a question?  Yeah.  Feel free there, Mr. Blowfly.  Have you hearing you describe that pet chick?  I'd like to ask y'all a question.  Guys, you got to let me know.  Should I fuck that big pet hoe? 
[03:42:30]  She was too fat to fuck it.  There you go.  And he's off.  Nice tooth is looking fine.  Wow.  Yeah.  Play the police sign, Lee.  Please.  Ah, yeah.  Blowfly.  Food, all right?  Jim?  All right, Blowfly.  Yeah, Blowfly.  What do you want to talk about today?  I think she's too fat to fuck.  She's too fat to fuck.  She's too fat to fuck.  All she can do is suck. 
[03:43:00]  Where is it?  There he goes.  Chase away.  Chase away the Blowfly.  Blowfly sucks.  Should we take a break and then we'll end the show?  Yeah.  All right, we'll take a break.  Gary Hoey in studio.  We're going to take a quick break.  We'll be back.  It is a natural impulse to grab and squeeze, squeeze the bread. 
[03:43:30]  Squeeze the bread.  No shit.  It's real, real soft.  Almost like pudding.  Almost like pudding.  Yes.  It's a hot piece of ass.  Quite a handful.  Yeah.  The nipples are so sensitive that a mere tweak between finger and thumb will give a perfectly  good result.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  What are you doing today?  In case you didn't know.  The O.B. and Anthony Show.  XM 202.  Savage animal. 
[03:44:00]  Savage animal.  We'll be right back. 
[03:44:30]  We'll be right back. 
[03:45:00]  The guitar work on his stuff there.  The title track off his new CD, American Made.  Yes, sir.  Very good.  GaryHoe.com, right?  Yes, sir.  Thanks for having me, guys.  No problem.  Not a problem.  Foaming pussy, day one.  Nothing. 
[03:45:30]  Did you really think we are really going to have to find the perfect girl for this?  I thought...  And I think it's going to entail...  I thought someone would have showed up by now.  Finding a prostitute.  Oh, I don't know.  What do you think, Jim?  You're a prostitute?  We'll get one.  Are you a hooker?  Well, we failed day one.  No, we asked wait, though.  Don't forget.  We asked wait.  We'll see what tomorrow brings as far as the foaming pussy goes.  All right? 
[03:46:00]  That's good soup, huh?  Yeah.  That's a fucking...  Soap, man.  Turkey, chili, bread burp.  Joe in Jersey.  Yo, I'll be sick at line of the day for I'm white and I'm insured.  The only way to live.  I'm feeling good today.  I feel like I might take it today.  I like my chances as far as line of the day goes.  I'm white and I'm insured and how Anthony wrote a check for $70,000 every night.  I liked Open the Window, There Goes Credibility, myself. 
[03:46:30]  If I was going to give myself...  Not line of the day.  No way.  Why not?  You had better ones than that.  That was like a throwaway.  Well, we're moments away from...  And it was true.  Crowning line of the day.  There's two runner-ups and one winner.  And they're all ice.  Jesus Christ.  I know.  No kidding.  Let's say hi to Fire Ant, the trucker.  Fire Ant, what are you hauling?  Oh, my God.  Is this truffle good?  What am I hauling?  Yeah.  Are you eating a truffle, Opie?  Of course.  What? 
[03:47:00]  Sausage casings.  Thank you.  What is he hauling?  Sausage casings.  Sausage casings?  Yeah, I'm not even kidding.  Pig intestine.  Yeah.  Well, no.  They're artificial.  Oh.  Ew.  Not even the real deal.  What the fuck are they made out of?  You got to eat them, right?  Fuck, I don't know.  I just haul it, man.  Wow.  We need that many, huh?  I guess.  I guess.  Dude, truckloads.  Truckloads?  Just truckloads of sausage casing.  That's right.  A lot of fucking sausage being made. 
[03:47:30]  All right.  What did you learn today?  I learned that Blowfly's real name was Weird Al Yankanix.  Hey, that was going to be the light of the day.  Okay.  I think so.  I think so.  Thank you.  As I said it, I felt it might not have been close enough.  The Vic-Nick thing, but it seemed to work.  It worked.  All right.  Let's say hi to Ryan in Wisconsin.  Ryan.  Hey, man.  How's it going?  I just want either you guys to put it on the pad data or maybe spell out how to spell  Gary Howey. 
[03:48:00]  I don't know how to spell Howey.  That's a good idea.  H-O-E-Y, right?  Yeah.  Throw up his website.  Yeah.  It's like Joey with an H.  Yep.  Yeah.  There you go.  H-J-O-E-Y.  With an H.  Bring me a speller.  Like Joey with an H.  Joey.  Joey.  Joey.  I didn't name my son Joey or my daughter Zoe, though.  Oh.  Joey Howey.  Joey Howey and Zoe Howey.  Zoe Howey.  I was going to, but I didn't do it.  What are their names?  My daughter's Allison.  My son's Ian.  Well, it's a good thing that Howey isn't your middle name and Molly being your last name. 
[03:48:30]  Rob on Long Island.  Hey, what's up, man?  Hey.  Yeah, I learned that Jimmy wants to have a contest where fat girls eat Apple computers.  And if you guys are going to be doing line of the day, you guys should also do bomb of  the day.  That's too much, sir.  What are we going to do?  Yeah, we do bombs and flubs, which is a bit.  Why?  Don't have to focus on it every day.  So I finally win a contest. 
[03:49:00]  Let's go to Rick in Miami.  Rick.  Hey, guys.  Hello, Rick.  Line of the day.  Anthony, when you said I graduated 2000, I had to pull my car over, literally.  Oh, with the await right.  Thank you, sir.  And Jimmy, I'm coming to see you in West Palm, baby.  Oh, thank you, sir.  I sure do appreciate the support.  How good is that truffle?  A wonderful truffle with your soup.  Oh.  The soup guy knows how to do this shit.  Anybody else see the commercial for Domino's? 
[03:49:30]  No.  Pizza and brownies?  Anyone else pick up on this?  Jesus.  Yeah.  That's their new promotion?  Yeah.  I saw that.  I'm sure, uh, what's her name, dude?  Fuck.  Can't remember.  I have a fat name.  Marilyn.  Marilyn.  She actually put the brownie on the pizza and ate it like a topping.  That is like...  I'm back in one second.  I have to do something.  And it's free.  The brownies are free when you order a pizza.  All right, Jimmy.  All right.  They got to come up with all their gimmicks with the, uh, pizzas these days.  People aren't just satisfied with a goddamn pizza. 
[03:50:00]  What are you doing?  Farting in the control room.  Oh, did he?  Yeah, I see him now.  They're panicking with air freshener and...  That's good.  That's got to smell worse than Travis's pussy.  Swear to you.  Oh, the fatty, uh, pig fatty, uh, promo's done.  Fatty, pig fatty promo's done already?  Uh...  That's Steve C.  Uh, Strump, what's up?  Hey, nomination line of the day?  Yeah.  When Anne said being white really is the shit.  Uh, well, again, too true to be funny. 
[03:50:30]  We'll see what...  Yeah, but it's a good line.  We'll see what the guys, uh, decided on.  But first, it's the fatty, pig fatty promo.  Contest starts tomorrow.  It's the Opie and Anthony fatty pig fatty contest.  The Opie and Anthony show is looking for fat, blubbery, undisciplined women to point and laugh at.  Don't worry, we're willing to pay for the privilege.  Just haul your big, embarrassing ass down to our free FM studio in New York City,

[03:51:30]  That works, right?  That's good.  All right.  I like it.  Hey, you know what?  For the hell of it,  if the listeners want to make their own promos,  that's always fun to listen to.  Hey, of course.  And we got the MacBook still up for great.  Right.  I have a jingle for the contest.  Yeah?  Oh, do you?  Let's hear it.  It's fatty pig fatty time!  Fatty pig fatty time!  Can't even get through it.  What the hell?  I can't do it. 
[03:52:00]  It's fatty pig fatty time!  Fatty pig fatty time!  Fatty pig fatty time!  Yes, it is!  Let's go to Bill and Jersey.  Hello, Bill!  Bill?  Hello, Bill!  Hello, Bill!  I think Mr. Norton had the best line of the day when he asked the fat chick,  how do you work out?  Do you lay down in a puddle and play Iwo Jima on you?  Nah.  Wow.  Thank you.  You translated it so well. 
[03:52:30]  Wow.  Bill in Brooklyn.  How you doing, boys?  Good morning.  Hello, another Bill.  Hello.  Yeah, I don't know if it was Opie or Jimmy, but we're reading on the MySpace and said,  I'm crying more often, and someone said, and so are your flaws.  That was me.  Thank you.  Wait.  Could an underdog take it today.  Nico, Nico, from D.C.  Hey, what's going on, guys? 
[03:53:00]  Hey, man.  Hey, y'all all officially lose for the line of the day.  Steve C. wins.  That was the funniest fucking trailer for a contest I have ever heard.  Yeah.  Well, contest starts tomorrow.  Hopefully, Sarah will stop by.  $10 for every humiliating pound.  Humiliating pound.  All right.  Mongo, the trucker.  Mongo.  Hey, good morning, guys.  Good morning.  And meh, meh.  And, uh, look. 
[03:53:30]  Some of Jimmy's noises.  I learned that 463 does not go into any order, Will.  Unless you throw in a square.  Uh, meh, meh.  He didn't do it with the enthusiasm that you do, but he did well.  All right.  Let's, uh, Jeremy in Cleveland.  Jeremy?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I just wanted to say I learned you can make an echo out of Travis's pussy.  Punch it out.  Oh, that was good.  Tony in Florida. 
[03:54:00]  What did you learn, man?  I learned at ONA of hogging up the airwaves.  Yeah, we got to get that billboard hogging up the airwaves.  We'll pay for it ourselves.  Punch it.  Let's go to Todd on Long Island.  Todd.  Todd?  What?  Hey there, Todd.  Twod?  All right.  Dave in Jersey?  Hey, Ope, you had the best line of the day when, uh, she said she went to military school  and he asked her if she was a tank.  Yep. 
[03:54:30]  That was a good line of mine.  That was very funny.  Wow.  There's a lot of lines to choose from.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Uh.  Candidates for line of the day.  This is Franco from Oceanside.  Uh.  All from the phone convo.  Girl, girl, I'm very active for a fat girl.  Anthony, like trying to get out of the tar pits.  Oh, cool.  Uh, girl, I was in the military.  Opie, were you the tank?  Jimmy, four, six, three, back to back and belly to belly. 
[03:55:00]  And belly to belly.  All right.  Let's do line of the day.  Wow.  Very exciting today.  It's like a neck and neck horse race.  I personally enjoyed my line when she said my boyfriend got accused of something he didn't  do at work and accused of doing something.  And I said, was it beastiality?  Beastiality.  Come on.  That's another great line.  That might have taken it.  I don't even care if, uh, if I, uh, don't win.  I just want to say being nominated with you two, uh, today. 
[03:55:30]  So much talent, uh, going out over the airwaves today.  Uh, it makes me happy.  I'm glad you're taking the high road.  If I don't win, some Jews are getting hit.  Wait, hold on.  Uh, Darren from Montana.  Darren.  Hey there.  Going in for the line of the day.  Okay.  All right.  I think it was, was it Opie who said, uh, called the chubby girl Marilyn?  Did he actually call her Marilyn? 
[03:56:00]  No.  Oh, no.  Oh, all right.  Jesus.  I think you get line of the day with your error.  All right.  That's funny.  That would be, uh, Jimmy when, uh, the girl was talking about her boyfriend getting written  up at, at work and, uh, Jimmy asked if it was for beastiality.  Yes.  Yeah, that line was really good.  Hey, do we have time to play, uh, Wild Bill's new Wow Sweeper from Wild Bill Productions?  Anything from Wild Bill Productions there's always time for.  All right. 
[03:56:30]  Bill's now an employee.  He was just an intern.  Yeah.  He's nutty as a fruitcake.  My favorite Bill story.  The guy's completely insane.  Happened recently.  Yeah.  And he's done some great stuff for us.  When we were at, uh, the Camden show.  Mm-hmm.  At the Tweeter Center.  Yeah.  And after the show, we decided to sign autographs and take pictures for well over two hours.  And there was a long, long table and it was, uh, I'm trying to remember the order.  It was like Bob Kelly and then it was Voss, then it was me, then it was Jimmy, then it  was Anthony, then it was Patrice, and then it was, uh, was Wild Bill. 
[03:57:00]  Bill decided.  Just signing autographs.  He sat and he just, out of nowhere, decided to sit his ass down at the end of the table  and everything that was being slid down the table for everyone to sign, he would just  grab it as it came past him, sign his name and hand it to the person.  Were people questioning you?  Oh, no.  They had no idea what was going on.  And they wouldn't even ask, like, hey, who the fuck are you?  Yeah.  The best part was when they tried to pass me, I'd point at the poster, I'd point on  the table, and so they'd, like, kind of hesitantly hand it over, I'd grab it out of the hand 
[03:57:30]  and sign my name over a caricature.  Because they didn't want you signing it, but you forced your signature upon me.  Good boy.  You're a psychopath, I love it.  Well, he is famous, so.  Yeah.  He, uh, yeah, he, uh, he was an intern, he's now an employee, but we learned during his  time as an intern that he really is quite crazy and insane and creepy.  He writes these sketches, he writes scripts for things that are, they don't make sense,  they're, they're silly. 
[03:58:00]  You wrote that one that Steve, we have all his acting clips on.  I prefer to say original.  Yes, original is one way you could put it.  I like crazy and insane.  Okay.  And, uh, he has a wow promo.  Yeah.  Here it is.  From Wild Bill Productions.  The Opie and Anthony Show presents a Wild Bill Productions. 
[03:58:30]  Hey, kid, need a ride?  Master, what's that rubber sticker on your car?  That's a wow sticker.  What's a wow sticker?  Now, you look tired.  Need a ride home?  What's a wow sticker?  I put it on my van so women will flash me when they drive by.  Listen, I've got some kittens in the back of my car.  Where can I get a wow sticker?  OpieandAnthony.com.  Now listen, your mommy and daddy were in a terrible accident and asked me to drive you  to the hospital.  Oh no! 
[03:59:00]  I hope mommy and daddy are okay.  Quick, get in.  Let go of my arm, you're hurting me.  Get in here.  I'm in here.  That wasn't even a promo.  That was actually audio from Steve's ride over.  Get in my Prius.  Okay, terrific.  Get in.  That was for a wow sticker?  Oh.  Oh yeah.  Okay.  I didn't quite pick up what that was actually for. 
[03:59:30]  Wasn't much mention of the wow sticker.  What It Really Does.  Well, it was originally, I wrote it for Free FM, so you can't say most of the stuff that  you would put in a wow sticker promo for here.  Oh, you said a lot though.  You said a lot.  Yeah, yeah.  Volumes.  You're very talented.  You said a lot.  Well, you can't say certain things better than mimic child rape.  Yeah.  Jesus.  Abduction.  I have to piss badly.  I'm okay.  I'm in pain.  I want a good line of the day.  Oh, that's good.  Come here.  I'll poke your belly.  All right. 
[04:00:00]  Line of the day.  Get the sweeper in there.  Where is it?  What?  Where is it?  Sweepers for the winner, so.  All right.  Oh.  This is the first of two runner-ups?  Yes.  All right.  The first runner-up line of the day.  No, wait.  Is this third place?  I don't know runner-ups.  The second runner-up?  Yes.  So this is second runner-up?  Yes.  Who is third place?  Third place.  Okay.  Second runner-up.  Best line of the day.  Okay.  Okay.  I've had enough of his form showing slacks.  What, did he get the Ben blessing?  I don't know. 
[04:00:30]  That turnoff walks around just crotch first.  He loves it.  All right.  You guys got lazy.  Third place?  They decided to cut the contest at 10 o'clock, obviously.  No.  No.  Well, defense.  Well, you know.  It's third place.  I'll even say my own thing.  That wasn't one of the better lines.  It's not going to be gold.  Their decisions are final.  Yeah.  We're going to have to change the judges, though.  You ever see third runner-up at the beauty contest?  Yeah, but there's a lot of other lines.  The one that's a little off? 
[04:01:00]  The boobs a little bigger?  A little piss-eyed?  All right.  The second best line of the day.  Can you comment?  No, hold on.  You lost a lot of weight from what I see here.  Bringing more attention, like you could hide.  Because it says graduated 2,000.  So you dropped, what?  How much is that?  I can't do math real quick.  30 pounds.  Okay.  Thank you.  I'd like to accept this runner-up.  That was... 
[04:01:30]  Okay.  All right.  I'm happy with that, depending on what number one is.  There were better lines.  That was a good line.  I mean, I'm not to take away from that.  Well, better lines.  You had better lines, I'm saying.  I did?  I think so.  I don't remember.  I think it's jingled.  Let's just hear what the first place winner of the line of the day is.  Here comes the line of the day. 
[04:02:00]  Line of the day.  That should be line of the day.  That is an awful song of the day.  What about fat pigs for fat cash?  No.  Too wordy.  Too long.  Not mean enough.  This is too long.  How about I try to play the guitar?  How's that?  Let me try to play the guitar and...  Does anybody remember last day? 
[04:02:30]  Obigus line of the day.  All right.  With a Gary Hoey bashing.  My first victory.  Happy to help, bro.  It's a great way to segue into another Gary Hoey song.  But we got...  I love how we had uncomfortable moment of the day twice now.  That was wonderful.  Yeah.  Thank you.  Fatty pig fatty.  I got to hear the promo again.  Fatty pig fatty.  Contest starts tomorrow.  And tomorrow we also look for a foaming pussy.  Yes.  Please help us out.  It's the Opie and Anthony fatty pig fatty contest. 
[04:03:00]  The Opie and Anthony show is looking for fat, blubbery, undisciplined women to point and laugh at.  Don't worry.  We're willing to pay for the privilege.  Just haul your big, embarrassing ass down to our free FM studio in New York City,  strap a pig mask around your fat skull, squeeze your hindquarters into a bikini,  and have a snack for $15.  The biggest mess to waddle through the door at the end of the contest wins $10 for every humiliating pound on her carcass.  So if you're saddled with 350 pounds of embarrassing flab, you get $3,500. 
[04:03:30]  Try those tears, young lady.  Three grand buys a lot of Kleenex and a lot of pizza.  Brought to you by your compassionate friends at the Opie and Anthony show.  That's really good.  Excellent.  Love it.  That starts tomorrow.  Great idea, by the way, Jimmy.  Great idea.  We're going to have some more of these contests.  I'm telling you, we're going to do something with anorexics.  Yeah, we should.  The fucking bulimic who can lose the most weight.  I'm telling you, we got it all under control. 
[04:04:00]  Binge and purge.  Binge and purge.  We can puke the most up into a bucket in one sitting.  How much you can eat and then purge.  How about most ribs showing?  I like that, too.  And by the way, listeners can send in their own promos for Fatty Pig Fatty.  Yeah, the barbarism is back.  Yeah, we finally did a meeting yesterday.  I think we should do meetings more often.  As long as they're like that.  I'm going to sit there and no boring meetings.  We have constructive meetings.  All right. 
[04:04:30]  Gary Hoey, it's been a pleasure.  Thank you, Gary.  He's been playing live for us all morning long.  Get the big plug in and then jam something nice for us.  Rock up.  American-made in stores now.  My daughter needs braces.  Her teeth are real messed up.  Buy the CD.  Thank you.  All right.  This is Gary Hoey.  GaryHoe.com.  Yes, sir.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  We'll see you tomorrow.  guitar solo 
[04:05:00]  I was hit by a mad truck  I was running out of bad luck  I was left by the roadside  A swift kick to my backside 
[04:05:30]  I had never been free  From the chains that bound me  I was seeing the light of day  But it was coming my way  Hey, yeah  I must have been found  If I don't  I think it's time for a reaction 
[04:06:00]  Yeah  For a reaction  I was looking in a rude place  Laughing in the devil's face  I said, I'm not a mayday  Troubles head on my way  Life will slip through my head  Time to make my stand 
[04:06:30]  I was thinking you were the one  Yeah  Now I'm back to square one  Yeah, yeah  I must have been wrong  To better tell  I think it's time for a reaction  For a reaction  For a reaction  Oh  To better tell 
[04:07:00]  Oh  Oh  Oh  guitar solo
