<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a discussion about the winner of a whipped cream bikini contest, Kelly, who was scheduled to appear in studio to claim her prize, a trip to Hawaii.  This segued into a conversation about a New York Post article detailing the rise of "hail hookers" in Times Square.  Numerous callers shared their anecdotes about encountering these prostitutes, with Larry recounting a particularly humorous story involving a prostitute demanding his watch and boots as collateral. Joe claimed the phenomenon wasn't new. Jim Norton called in, adding his own humorous experiences and commentary, including a story about unintentionally exposing his genitals.  Douglas Montero, the author of the New York Post article, also called in and was playfully questioned about his research methods.  The hosts also discussed a memo from station management urging them to mention 102.7 WNEW and the show's name more frequently. They previewed upcoming guests: Dr. Dirty, Kimmy (from *Survivor*), and Angela (from an HBO special),  and promoted an upcoming Hard Rock Cafe appearance. A runaway train news story, ultimately less dramatic than initially reported, was also mentioned, alongside discussion of an escort service advertisement that had recently aired on the station.

The show then moved on to its new sponsor, NewYork-Exotics.com, an escort service.  The hosts, along with in-studio guests Joey from Paisano's and Jim Norton, spent considerable time browsing the website, explicitly describing the profiles of various escorts. They dissected the website's categories, pricing, and the differences between "in-call" and "out-call" services.  A significant portion of the segment involved creating and airing a radio advertisement for the escort service, with Steve Seam's voiceover repeatedly compared to a cancer PSA. An advertisement for Pinnacle Horny Goat Weed was also discussed as a complementary product.  A recurring comedic element involved attempts to set up their producer, Earl, with an escort from the website, which he resisted.  A listener guessing game determined the price of an hour with escort Erica.  Other calls included a listener discussing an online auction for a virgin's virginity and a former massage parlor employee sharing anecdotes.  Commercial breaks featured New York Sports Clubs and Sam Adams beer.

The next segment featured a phone call with Jim Norton, who discussed his upcoming shows and shared jokes, including a limerick.  He mentioned Timothy McVeigh's proximity to him in Buffalo and touched upon the Robert Blake murder trial and the JonBen√©t Ramsey case.  A caller, John, discussed hockey and the Mets.  Kimmy from *Survivor* was in studio, commenting on the show's voting system. Her brother, Joe, performed a song about *Schindler's List*, described as a "peppy little ditty."  The hosts revisited the missing whipped cream bikini contest winner. Vinny called in with a possibly untrue story about seeing Kimmy kissing an older man.  The conversation shifted to Angela from the HBO *Bellevue* documentary, who discussed her experiences and lawsuit against HBO, with clips from the documentary playing.  A game ensued where the hosts guessed which celebrity Kimmy slept with, ultimately revealing it to be Kevin James.  The segment was rife with sexually suggestive comments and jokes, touching on sensitive and controversial topics.

The final segment focused heavily on the Kimmy/Kevin James rumor. The hosts and callers engaged in a running joke about their alleged sexual encounter, fueled by Kimmy's ambiguous responses. Callers offered various sexually explicit theories and crude humor about Kevin James's anatomy. Angela, present in the studio, offered a contrasting reaction to the vulgar humor.  The conversation frequently revolved around the size of Kevin James's penis, sexual encounters in bathrooms, and other sexually suggestive topics. The hosts relentlessly pressed Kimmy for confirmation or denial, escalating to increasingly outlandish scenarios involving Jim Norton.  The show ended with more listener calls speculating about Kimmy and Kevin James, interspersed with other calls and banter. Brother Joe's song was played again.  The hosts promoted an upcoming Hard Rock Cafe event and a Radiohead listening party.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What's going on here today?  Hello!  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Rick just put the one sheet in front of me.  We've got a busy show today.  We've got some people on board.  Want me to run down everything we're doing today on the show?  Give us a quick thing and we'll see how many we actually really get to.  Whipped cream bikini contest winner Kelly.  Yes.  She'll be in studio at 5 to claim her trip to Hawaii.  Will there be any victory pictures of her? 
[00:00:30]  I'm hoping.  That can be taken and put on the side.  Because she was the runaway winner of the Whipped Cream Bikini Contest.  Rick, does it seem like she'd be willing to take some victory photos?  Oh, definitely.  Nice.  Definitely.  I'm hearing rumors that she doesn't really listen to the show.  Who cares?  Yeah, I don't care.  That's like, that might be a problem somewhere else.  I hear she still doesn't listen to the show.  I thought we would have converted her by now.  Yeah, see, the thing is, when I called her yesterday, she had no idea that she'd won. 
[00:01:00]  And all the other women that were involved in that contest are like hardcore listeners of  themselves.  Yeah, I mean, second place was in Hawaii and she called me and said, how did I do?  Because she couldn't hear the show.  And the one that won it doesn't listen.  I've got to find out what she listens to.  That would be interesting to find out.  Also, that guy from the Post is calling.  Whoa, in a little while.  Yeah.  We hit on that story real quick at the end of the show yesterday.  There's hookers in Times Square, right there in the middle of the city, driving around  in cars now. 
[00:01:30]  You know, usually you'd have to pull up to a seedy area, you'd see a street walker, and  you'd pull your car over and ask her out.  Not that I know, Joey.  Joey Paisano here.  And usually that's the way it's done.  And now these girls are driving around in Lexuses and Mercedes and really hot SUVs and stuff.  And they pull right up to you.  They pull up to you.  Your Lexus is here.  And say, yes, yeah.  They pull up to you and say, hey, what's up?  They actually go after the guys leaving the strip club that's in Times Square. 
[00:02:00]  Or all the bars, yeah.  Because they already have their hotel rooms.  And supposedly these hookers just line up right outside the strip club, right on the curb  in their cars, and you can jump in and go for a ride.  Go for a ride.  And they take care of you.  They're calling them hail hookers because you just hail them down.  Now, they get in the car.  Wang.  We want to talk to the writer of this story because we think he's using the paper to get  out of something. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, we didn't think he actually tried to.  He went out with the intention of doing this story.  Yeah.  Because he said, yeah, I was coming out of the Sheridan at 4 a.m., and one of these  girls approached me.  We're thinking the writer is married, Joey.  Four in the morning, he was looking for some loving.  Yeah.  One of these ladies was around, and all of a sudden he's like, somehow got caught maybe  by cops or something and said, oh, my God.  No, I'm a post writer, and I'm writing a story.  This is research.  Yeah.  You could get out of a lot of trouble.  You should have heard him this morning on the phone.  What? 
[00:03:00]  What did he say?  He calls me back at about almost noon.  He's like, yeah, Rick.  I'm like, well, he goes, it's Doug.  I just got up.  I was just waking up.  He goes, I was out all night.  He goes, I was out all night working on another story.  Douglas Montero.  A story of crack houses.  Let's go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  How you doing?  Oh, by the way, you're listening to 1027 WNAW.  We got part of the memo.  Yeah, we got a memo. 
[00:03:30]  They want us to tell people what station they're listening to a little more often.  They think that'll increase the ratings.  Not too distracting.  Joe, what's going on?  Yeah, that hooker thing.  They've been doing that for like five years now.  Uh-huh.  They used to, well, I used to think.  We were pulled up to a light one time.  All of a sudden, this girl's sitting there sucking on a lollipop, and she gives you the little notion.  I thought she was trying to pick us up.  Nobody really did that as hookers.  Yeah, but it was a school bus.  You were up to a lollipop there.  We know. 
[00:04:00]  All right.  Thank you, Joe.  No problem.  That was Joe calling 1027 WNAW.  Larry, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  I couldn't believe it.  I thought this chick was actually picking on me.  I was leaving the club.  It was Studio 54 last month.  She had a convertible BMW.  She said, hey, what's going on?  How you doing?  Want to go for a ride?  I'm like, sure.  I actually thought that this girl dug me.  Yeah, because the article, not to interrupt you, but the article said yesterday that  a lot of times it just looks like it's a girl from the suburbs that just is looking for 
[00:04:30]  some fun late at night.  Yeah, hot girl driving around.  All of a sudden, you're a guy.  You're walking down the street, and this chick starts hitting on you.  That's exactly what happened.  You're like, wait.  I think there was a camera in her glove compartment, because that's my life story.  Hey, Larry, I got audio of the girl propositioning you.  Well, you want to hear a funny story?  It's 4.30 in the morning.  I'm blown out of my shorts, and she says, hey, you know, you want to get it going?  I'm like, sure.  I thought I was in the twilight zone of vagina. 
[00:05:00]  And I don't have any money on me.  I blew it all at the bar.  I have my cash card on me.  Yeah.  And she's like, well, let's go up to a cash machine.  And I told her, you know, listen, why don't we go back to my apartment first?  So she goes, okay.  She goes, but if we go back to your place, you have to leave your watch and your boots in the car as collateral.  Your watch and your boots?  Yeah, because I was going to go into my, I had cash in my apartment.  Right.  So she wanted me to leave my watch and my boots in the car so I would come back out of the apartment. 
[00:05:30]  Unbelievable.  So how much did it cost you for the?  $175.  I think I paid for the rent for the car as well.  $175 for a hummer.  She spit on my meatball hero.  It was fantastic.  You've got some funky taste.  Oh, God.  All right, Larry.  Thank you.  Gracias.  Okay.  Let's go to Jerry.  Jerry, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I was wondering if you could tell me what station I'm listening to.  I'm a moron.  I can't read the dial on my radio.  Thanks, Jerry.  Yes, you're listening to 1027 WNEW.  Oh, thank you very much.  Mine just has the time on it. 
[00:06:00]  All right, Jerry.  All right, guys.  Well, Opie, it's not just 1027 like he saw.  On his radio.  I said it's 1027 WNEW.  Yeah.  Exactly.  Got to make sure you say both things.  Because we found out today that most people that listen to our show really don't even know  our names, Anthony.  Right.  We're just so full of ourselves that we're convinced that people know they're listening  to Opie Anthony.  Oh, no.  The average listener, they have problems in their own life, and they really don't pay as  much attention as you think, and they really don't know your names. 
[00:06:30]  Yeah.  So you should give out your names and the call letters of the station very often.  This isn't the IMAS in the morning station?  IMAS in the morning.  God, then we better not say another station's call letters or frequency, because you might  freak out.  That's right.  Think you're listening to that station.  By the way, IMAS, hire Sid.  Get it over with.  Guy's doing a really good job for you.  Sports guy!  You tool.  On IMAS.  Morning.  Hire the man.  He's doing a good job for you. 
[00:07:00]  Let me go to Joe.  Joe, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  I just want to let you know that you're listening to WNEW 102.7.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  You did it backwards.  I'm sorry.  102.7 WNEW.  Oh, oh, no.  According to the memo, don't do the point.  It's 102.7.  Right.  WNEW.  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.  W-A-N-E-W.  Ouch.  W-A-N-E-W, 102.7. 
[00:07:30]  Well, I can't hang up on the Skype for something.  W-A-N-E-W, 102.7.  Why don't we start that?  That's good.  Like me.  He's just going to do it again.  That's funny.  Jeez, imagine what a cluster F, uh,  ouch, caused when he was in here.  One, no, two.  Uh-oh, dot.  Yeah, the super fly.  Seven.  All right, so we're going to talk to the hooker guy. 
[00:08:00]  Well, he's not a hooker, he's a writer for the post.  Whatever, he wrote the story.  We'll talk to him in a little bit.  Yeah.  John Valby, Dr. Dirty, he's calling us at five.  Uh-huh.  We have some of the songs that we can play,  because he's not going to be able to play over the phone.  Did we bleep out some of those that got dumped on the air?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Great, good.  Yeah, it's just, they're in long form.  Okay.  Maybe you could isolate one or two so we could play, you know, play them today.  Jim Norton.  Oh, he's on the phone already.  He's on the line. 
[00:08:30]  Norton.  Hi, is this 1027 WNEW, Opie and Anthony?  Oh, nice, Jim, nice.  By the way, I was just calling yesterday, but I was out.  The hookers have been writing around for years, by the way.  This is not new.  Now, Norton would know this.  Now, he is an expert.  Believe me.  For many years.  That's why I'm suspicious about this guy writing the story yesterday.  I really think he got in some trouble.  Because I had no clue.  To tell you the truth, it was a new story to me.  I'd never heard of this before.  And five years after the fact, he comes up with this like it's a story? 
[00:09:00]  This has been happening for probably eight or nine years.  And you know what this, I guess this is where my self-esteem is.  The first time I was there a proposition by a girl in the car like that, I knew she was a hooker.  Oh, really?  Because it ain't going to happen.  No, no.  There's no one going to pull up and stand next to the breast hanging out and just talk to me.  It's not going to happen.  That's exactly what happens with these guys who your ego gets in the way.  And you actually think this chick is looking at you and hot to grab you off in Times Square.  No, not too many people there.  Ho-ho!  It's packed with people. 
[00:09:30]  But she's singling you out.  Well, you know what the thing is, too?  They never have, and this is very rare that they're going to have New York plates.  They always have Georgia or Tennessee.  They have an out-of-state license plate.  That I haven't figured out yet.  I never was going to ask while I was giving money for it.  But they never have New York plates either.  Is that easier for you when you cave their skull in and ditch the car somewhere that it's out-of-state?  Yeah, I always find it's a little bit easier to get rid of the license plate.  I think it has something to do with not being able to trace traffic by whatever it is.  And you can always tell the higher-class ones, because they drive the Pimp's trucks. 
[00:10:00]  The really hot ones are in the Explorers and the Benzes, because they're driving the Pimp's main car.  And then the really awful ones are in the Saturns and in the little Chevys.  The Saturns?  It's true.  It's true.  The hotter they are, the nicer the truck they're driving.  ADMW.  Jim, let's get back to our little wow road trip from Friday.  Very nice, by the way.  It was awesome.  You realize you left the jellyfish in the keg water, right?  Yeah, there was nothing I could do about that.  I mean, I can kind of control where it goes when it comes out. 
[00:10:30]  But once they have it, it's up to them what they do with it.  Yeah, he's just like, hey, look.  She didn't want to swallow.  Jim, you were cracking me up so bad at Dublin Pub.  Yeah.  By the way, you know what?  I guess I got to join the rest of your friends.  Nice hog.  Oh, thank you.  Oh, Jesus.  What was that about?  Look at Joey.  Look at Joey all shocked.  I know.  Joey and I hang.  We don't have to show each other our hogs.  I remember we don't.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[00:11:00]  Joey, you weren't listening yesterday?  I didn't hear the end.  Oh, okay.  So we're at the Dublin Pub.  We're just snot at all of us, you know?  And Norton is like, we're doing shots.  Well, Norton wasn't doing shots, but he's hanging with us.  And he's laughing uncontrollably.  And I don't understand why.  He's just standing there with his fly open and all his, I mean, all of his junk.  Everything was pulled through?  Oh, yeah.  In the middle of the day.  And he just, I guess he was just waiting to see how long it would take for someone to  realize that he's just standing there with all the other guys with his junk just hanging 
[00:11:30]  out.  I kept rubbing up against the girl at the bar.  That's why I was pointing to you, and I was just, like, trying to put it on her leg.  Oh, gosh.  And he was, Anthony, he was trying to get your attention.  Yeah, because I was laughing.  But you were distracted.  Oh, yeah.  You were talking to other listeners.  Norton's got this move where he just kind of puts his junk on the girl's leg.  But it wasn't even, like, a sex vibe, you know, because there's, like, you know, 400  drunk guys there.  Oh, no, not even a sex vibe. 
[00:12:00]  You're putting your junk on her leg.  You know what he does?  Don't worry.  I won't use anyone as an example here.  But let's say that this chair's a girl.  All right.  And you've described what we're doing.  This is a radio, okay?  Standing up in front of the chair.  Here's the bar.  Most guys would kind of, like, carefully go around the girl and, like, ask for a drink.  Right, because you've got to squeeze in, so you turn kind of sideways.  You get in there.  You make your room at the bar.  Let's say this is the girl's back.  All right.  This is how Jim orders a drink from the bar.  Oh, humping her back.  No, he just kind of puts it on her.  Thrust his pelvis into her back. 
[00:12:30]  And he just kind of keeps it there.  And, you know, he's on her back.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Classy move, Jim.  Yeah, I know.  I'm a real creep.  But I found out that girl had out-of-state plates, too, so it was nice.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  I don't care what she does with it.  And I apologize for her being in the keg water.  It was in the keg water.  Well, as long as it wasn't anywhere near the keg or anything else.  As a matter of fact, though, someone reached in to the water to wash something off their 
[00:13:00]  hand.  Oh, God.  Who was it?  I think it was Dan.  Was it Dan?  Dan the man?  Dan, yeah.  He had something sticky on his hand, I guess.  And coincidentally enough, once he washed it, he had something sticky on his hand, too.  Yeah, I know.  You go to clean your hands and you pull up a little HIV on them.  That's nice.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  I saw it in the water.  I've got to be honest.  It was awful.  I was waiting for you to get out of the back of a bowling alley.  It was really awful.  No, of course you saw it, because then when you realized it was there, you had to make 
[00:13:30]  sure everyone else sawing it out.  Well, because you're not, though.  You have to.  You have to show your friends.  You were laughing uncontrollably, going, right there.  Let's take it out.  I thought someone spilled some egg drop soup into the ice bucket.  But no, it was not.  And Greg, Steve from Foundry filmed it.  I hope he has a picture of that.  I don't know if it came out on film.  Oh, God.  Yeah, you know, Steve with his camera, he had to get in there and film it.  He's great.  Of course.  And then I was making sure that the tap, because it was one of the taps that you are on the  end of a plastic hose.  So I'm making sure that doesn't go into the thing, because then we would have just had 
[00:14:00]  to tap that other keg.  Yeah, well, no.  I wouldn't have had her.  You know, I would have made sure she aimed away from where the people are drinking out  of.  Well, that would have been the ultimate thing.  But you guys are my friends.  You can't do that.  Degradation.  You know.  You know, I have some pride and some glad.  Yeah, well.  But that was a lot of fun.  Thanks for your help, Brian.  Oh, it's phenomenal.  Are you kidding me?  It was all girls and just maniacs.  I had a great time.  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  But then we're doing the next one.  Let me know.  I'll be starting to go along and, you know, not wear underwear again.  That'll make me very happy. 
[00:14:30]  Where are you today?  What's that?  Where are you today?  I'm home.  I got to do laundry.  I have so much laundry to do, and I got to take it down to this Asian lady.  I'm so irritated, because I don't have time to do it, so I got to take it to her.  I was hoping, you know, it would be something new.  You were performing or something, and that's why you couldn't be here, and you're calling in.  But it just turns out, I'll be, he's doing his laundry.  Doing his laundry.  I got to do laundry.  This flat-ass Asian club, she's got to do my laundry for me, but I got to do it.  I think myself today.  I don't know.  I'm really annoyed. 
[00:15:00]  I saw a Chinese girl with a nice, juicy hiney yesterday.  I was very happy about that.  Really?  Very rare.  Well, they're usually flat, right?  You show me a Chinese girl with a nice ass, and I'll show you a Puerto Rican raping her mother.  It's very rare.  You're out of your mind.  Did that go through?  Of course it did.  I don't want that one on the dump sheet.  I was hoping the dump sheet, that's great.  I love that, by the way.  Yeah.  All right, Jim.  Okay, are you Kimmy coming in today?  I think so.  I think Kimmy's on our list. 
[00:15:30]  We have so many things.  We've got Angela from the HBO Bellevue special coming in at 4.  We have the rapist from The Sopranos calling in at 5.30.  We have Adam Farrar calling in to talk about the job that got picked up by ABC.  Did it get picked up?  Nice.  Kimmy from Survivor, I think she's in the city.  She's stopping by.  Supposedly she had sex in a bathroom at one of these clubs in the city.  That's what we're hearing.  Was that her?  We don't know.  We're going to ask her.  It was reported in the Post.  It shows you what a loser I am.  I'm in a bathroom with her. 
[00:16:00]  I get nothing.  More than canoodling.  What did Kimmy say about that?  She said it wasn't her.  Yeah.  All right.  Who else?  She said she thinks she needs to top it.  Oh.  Oh, Norm, what the hell are you waiting for?  I know.  I know.  Longer to wait, my friend.  Yeah, you're right.  You're right.  Maybe I should just drop this off to the slope and come in.  I don't know.  It's up to you, man.  We're here if you want to come by. 
[00:16:30]  All right, guys.  All right.  I might actually come in if she wants to top it.  All right, cool.  You think she'd tinkle on someone?  Just curious, you know.  Could be.  Oh.  How nice would that be in the tabloids?  A little Goldie?  Yeah, Kimmy tinkling on a little oddly shaped head man.  That would be really nice.  We could try to make that happen for you.  Really?  Yeah.  You guys are my friends.  All right, Joe.  All right, 0181027.  I'll see you later.  All right, bye.  Would that be the most heinous thing ever?  No.  Do you think she'd do it? 
[00:17:00]  I wouldn't put it past her.  Yeah, I wouldn't put it past her.  She's never said no to the stuff we've asked her.  It's not like Norton hasn't seen this before.  Right.  Saw when he was cleaning up the whipped cream.  Well, we've got to take a quick break.  The phones are going nuts.  Everyone stay there.  We'll get to you.  All right, you're listening to Opie and Anthony on 1027-WNEW.  What else was in that memo?  Because it's pretty funny.  He's just talking about our audience and how we should, as you say, say 1027-WNEW because  people really don't know who they're listening to ever. 
[00:17:30]  Opie, half the people just think it's 102.7.  Right.  And then 22% of the people, they acknowledge this is 1027-WNEW.  Right.  16% just WNEW.  Right.  7% name a specific show plus 1027 and or WNEW.  And only 4% name a specific show alone.  But you mean the other part, though?  96% of us are idiots.  Is this what you want? 
[00:18:00]  Right.  The other part is really funny about how they just don't have time for your stupid lives.  Yeah.  No, I'm serious.  Pretty much it.  Where is it?  Because it was quite...  Pretty much what was written in the memo.  Talk for a second.  I got all excited when I walked past our mailboxes and saw a memo in there.  I'm like, oh, it'd be some cool memo.  I'm going to laugh at it.  Not the newsletter?  No, no.  I don't get psyched at the newsletter.  I get excited with memos, especially from the likes of Jeremy or Kent Stevens. 
[00:18:30]  It would be like, dream come true.  You hook up with a Kent Stevens memo, you'd be laughing your balls off at home.  You wake up at night, 2 in the morning, you go, huh?  What?  What an ass.  You know?  That's so funny.  How did he find the time to write?  But we love our memos here.  All right.  We'll decipher it and we'll get the better parts of it out on the right.  Oh, yeah.  This was just announced.  We're going to be at the Hard Rock Cafe across the street this Thursday night, right after 
[00:19:00]  the show for like an hour, maybe two hours.  Is this it?  We are vital, but small part of their large and complex lives.  That's what I was trying to find.  There you go.  That's what I was trying to find.  Most listeners get in the car, turn on the radio, turn us on, are entertained for the  moment, or select another station.  They listen to us because they'd rather hear entertainment than music, but we're a vital  but small part of their large and complex lives.  We're happy to be part of your large and complex lives, people. 
[00:19:30]  Sure.  We pour our hearts into this, but our listeners have their own jobs, their own passions, and  their own problems.  There's a real friggin' boost for everybody here.

[00:24:30]  Are you crazy?  Oh, Anthony, you should bring up the train thing before we get Douglas Montero on the phone from the post.  So, uh, we're sitting in the office, right?  We get the infamous phone call from Psycho Mark.  Always calls.  Now that it works over at Fox, whenever anything happens, he calls up.  Don't turn on Fox.  There's a runaway train on TV. 
[00:25:00]  We got a runaway train.  He says we.  Right.  Like, you know, he's, I'm a political part of Fox News.  He's in the nerve center over there at Fox.  I know.  Anthony, he knows before most people.  So, he looks at that, he looks at the monitors, and he calls us right up.  He calls for some really good stuff.  Got on Fox.  There's a guy with a gun.  Five cops around him.  In Dallas.  We'll lose it.  And he's black.  Yeah, yeah.  A black guy's being chased by the cops. 
[00:25:30]  The helicopter's got him.  It's on Fox.  I can't really use black guy, but I can't say that.  So, we have a little train.  Yeah, so there's this runaway train in Ohio.  It's got like 37 cars on it, full of hazardous material.  Hazmat.  So, the train's going to be like 47 miles an hour.  That's just cranking along.  The engineer drops dead or has a heart attack or something.  So, he can't control the train anymore. 
[00:26:00]  And the news copters are all around it.  They're watching it, and they're like, oh my God, how is this train going to stop?  You know, you think about movies.  I've seen a lot of cool movies, right?  With train, runaway trains.  What about the runaway train movie with Eric Roberts?  Runaway train.  That was a great movie.  That was a good one.  Right?  There's other movies.  There's plenty of movies where there's a runaway train.  And usually, the premise is, it's heading toward a bridge that's under construction, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  They've got to lower down a guy from a helicopter and get him on the train.  Oh, my God.  The first time, they're lowering him down, and oh, no, he got hit because he was going through a tunnel. 
[00:26:30]  Just a ridiculous thing.  So, I'm watching this going, this is so cool.  Maybe it'll hit a hairpin turn, fly off and explode.  No.  It starts just slowing down by itself.  Slows down to running speed.  A guy runs up the ladder in the front, and the train stops.  I'm like, this movie sucks.  This is the worst movie I've ever seen.  You thought it would be just like the movie.  Something.  The footage was funny because people were running faster than the train at one point. 
[00:27:00]  People were running faster than the train just so they could watch it.  And the reason why it did slow down, I guess the guy lifted his foot off the pedal there.  You know, or whatever controls it is.  There's some kind of fail safe on there, you know.  And we did get a thrill for a second when it was rumored that it was Robert Blake just trying to get home.  With the helicopters chasing him.  That's the way to do it.  A train.  But, no, it just ended, and it sucked. 
[00:27:30]  Ah, a little musical part of the story.  Very good.  That's so timely.  Nothing. 
[00:28:00]  We get nothing.  Come on, I just want to get to a runaway train.  No one can kill me now.  Ah, aah.  Ah, just say it.  It's time I can't really let myself run away.  Ah, yeah. 
[00:28:30]  Hey, that's done.  Jesus.  Do you really need soul asylum in this studio?  Oh, wow.  Nice.  That was more exciting than the train thing.  You watch these new stories.  I want some conclusions.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up?  I love it.  Look out!  What?  Check it out.  I was watching Fox 2, and supposedly there was nobody on that train. 
[00:29:00]  So now everybody's trying to scramble.  It was a live broadcast that they said, oh, supposedly nobody was there.  They can't figure it out.  There was an engine that pulled up behind the last car, coupled itself, and pulled it to  its stop itself.  You didn't see that because it was from a helicopter above, but that's what they said.  No, I was watching.  I saw the guy run into the front locomotive.  Yeah, yeah.  They slowed it down.  That's what happened prior to that.  Oh, the train.  There was an engine.  There was another one just like it, like the front one, that pulled up behind it and  coupled itself, and that's how it, you know.  Oh, okay.  It was anti-climax. 
[00:29:30]  You know, that was all.  It all sucked.  But I love the sound effects.  We thought it was going to get real exciting.  Yeah.  You know, but, all right.  All right, whatever.  Thank you.  All right.  I never liked the movies, though.  Sean, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, boys?  Hey.  Listen, I worked for the trailer from the early transit.  That pedal that you're talking about, that fail safe, it's called a dead man's pedal.  How did it get that name?  Well, because a few people died.  Of course.  So what happens is, if a guy removes his foot from the pedal, the train automatically  stops.  Yeah.  So that's why it's what the fail safe is. 
[00:30:00]  But, uh, because the engineers, they find ways to get around that.  Why couldn't he, like, die on the pedal so it would still be on real fast?  Oh, engineers get around that so they don't have to actually stand on it?  Pretty much, yeah.  Ah, you put a cinder block on there or something, and all of a sudden, uh, you could take a nap.  Well, if an engineer could have a on attack, we could still be going 90.  All right.  All right.  That's looking cool.  Well, thank you, Sean.  All right, boys.  Bye.  Bye.  Anthony, we got, uh, Douglas Montero on the line.  Yes.  From the New York Post.  Douglas? 
[00:30:30]  Hey.  Doug?  How you doing?  Doug, if you will.  Hey, hello.  What's going on?  How you doing?  Oh, I'm doing wonderful.  Yourself?  Well, um, uh, we read your, your, uh, your story in the paper yesterday about, uh, the  prostitutes that kind of drive up to you now.  Uh-huh.  And we thought the article was quite, uh, fascinating.  Yeah, it was a good article.  And we figured we'd get you on the, on the line and, uh, talk about it a little bit.  Sure.  It's a good subject.  Now, when did you first hear about this?  Uh, my boss told me about it, uh, uh, about a week ago. 
[00:31:00]  And how did he find out?  One of his buddies was walking around in the street saying that he was propositioned.  Oh, yeah?  Yes.  What I don't know is whether he accepted the proposition or not.  Uh, so you decided, uh, this would be a cool story when he told you, and you went out and  researched.  Exactly.  Now, what kind of research did you have to do?  I just had to go and find them.  Did you have to get in, uh, the cars with the ladies?  That's the only way I could get an interview.  Oh.  Oh.  Did you have to pay them to get the interview? 
[00:31:30]  Because their time is valuable.  Hey, wait a minute.  These are working women.  Yeah.  So, yes.  Oh, so you, you tossed them a few bucks just so they'd talk to you.  Well, I do, I do not want them to get into any trouble with their pimp.  And then since they're hanging out, they might as well give you some sexual favors too, right?  Well, I mean, if you, if you want to know any of those details, you're going to have  to call one of, one of my, uh, 1-900 numbers.  Yeah, I bet.  Yeah, to give you those details, yes.  Douglas, I, I would bet that you're not in a serious relationship right now. 
[00:32:00]  With who?  With you?  Yeah, with us.  No, it's obvious, because, I mean, no wife or serious girlfriend would, would feel  good about you, you know, doing this type of story.  I'm doing this story, four in the morning in front of the Sheridan.  Yeah, honey, I'm going to be out all night, and I'm doing a piece for the Post.  I got to, like, you know, jump in cars with prostitutes all night.  You don't have a problem with that, do you?  Well, you're absolutely right, but nevertheless, you have to, you have to figure that a reporter,  a reporter's wife or girlfriend is a very difficult occupation. 
[00:32:30]  Yeah.  Uh, honey?  Yeah, no, I'll be home, I'm with the hookers.  I'm with the hookers, baby.  No, that's cool.  No, I'll be home a couple hours after the sun comes up.  No problem.  Right.  You know, somehow we just can't see that working.  So, what else could you tell us?  I mean, these cars are driving around all over Manhattan, they're real nice cars, and  the girls are dressed for the nines inside, and they're just, do what, waiting outside  the strip clubs and the bars when everyone's trying to head home? 
[00:33:00]  Basically, that's what they do.  It's a very interesting way of picking up people.  Hmm.  And, uh, can you hail these girls down if you see one?  Yes.  And I'm curious, have any of you two ever been around midtown Manhattan at three o'clock in  the morning?  Now, don't tell me that you haven't now.  Three in the morning?  Yes, of course.  All right.  Well, have you ever been propositioned?  Douglas, I have to tell you, no.  Oh, get out of here.  I swear, because I've never been outside at three o'clock in the morning.  We even had a discussion a while ago, like, where did all the hookers go? 
[00:33:30]  Where did the hookers go?  Well, they're in the cars now.  Well, that's why you're on the phone, because you enlightened us here.  But we never get a proposition walking down the street.  Because you did all your research right around the building where broadcasts are from.  Exactly.  That's what I'm saying.  You guys have to hang out at three o'clock in the morning.  And I know that the both of you guys hang out at three o'clock in the morning, and you  tell your wives that you're, you know, doing some business arrangement or something like  that.  And I'll guarantee you that someone will pull up to you and say, hi. 
[00:34:00]  Now, Doug, I got an interesting question here.  It has to do with some legalities.  Now, when you're driving around in your car and you're looking for a hooker, and the hooker  comes to the window.  No, I was on foot.  No, no.  I'm just saying, here's the circumstance.  Say you're driving around, and there's the old-time streetwalker, and she comes up to  you at your window.  You know it's a hooker.  So if you're asking her for sex, and it's a cop, they bust you. 
[00:34:30]  That's what they do.  Now, if you see a hot girl pull up in a car, you don't know it's a hooker.  You haven't been, or you can say you didn't know it was a hooker.  Can the cops now start driving around in cars, propositioning guys waiting for you to say,  okay, and then bust you?  That would be the only way.  That would be the only way, because right now...  That seems scary, because a lot of guys would just be like, this is my lucky night.  Look at this hot chick's in a car.  You say, yeah, I want a BJ, or I want something, and all of a sudden, the cops come out of nowhere  when they give a little two-tooth on the horn, and you're busted. 
[00:35:00]  Exactly.  So that's the beauty of the system, that these prostitutes have set up.  I mean, they will actually go up and pick you up as if you're just a guy in the street.  And it isn't until you're actually in the car that they basically tell you it's going to cost you.  So you just think you're getting lucky.  Exactly.  And that's the beauty of it.  Because I would think it would be fun to go out at night, maybe if we're out late one night,  and just go on the street, and if you see one of these, you know, sort of F with them a little. 
[00:35:30]  But I know people that have gone to jail by Fing with the wrong prostitute,  because it's a cop doing a sting operation.  I spent the whole weekend in jail.  No, teasing, of course.  And Douglas, how easy was it for you to find one of these ladies in the car?  Very easy, especially around 4 o'clock in the morning.  The streets are basically deserted, and they just pull up.  They just come out of nowhere and just pull up and make believe that I'm cute.  And, you know, I'm an ugly guy. 
[00:36:00]  And, you know, I mean, here comes this girl who pulls up in a fancy car.  She's nice looking, and she's smiling at me, and I'm going, damn, I'm pretty.  Well, they could be picking you up for your sparkling personality.  They don't know anything about my personality.  You're a hooker!  I thought I was doing very well with you.  Listen, I don't even know how you guys look, but I'll guarantee you, at 4 o'clock in the morning,  if you stand in the corner, they'll stop, and they'll make you feel pretty.  All right, we might have to do a little in-depth research. 
[00:36:30]  Yeah, Doug, is this one of your favorite stories you've done so far?  No.  No? Which one is?  Well, my favorite story was revealing, you know, the experiments on children,  when they were doing some medical experiments on children.  Oh, that was you?  Yes, but...  And are you just busting on them?  A little bit.  Well, Doug, explain a little bit.  But it was a good story because I was able to go into the street. 
[00:37:00]  Yeah, and you're at 4 in the morning.  At 4 in the morning.  Nice.  All right, Douglas.  Doug, we're looking forward to your next story.  Okay.  What are you working on?  What are you working on?  Right now?  Yeah.  I can't reveal.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  But it has something to do with some illegal activity.  Oh, well, all right.  Okay.  All right, and if, by the way, if I happen to be walking around midtown Manhattan at 4 o'clock in the morning  and I see you guys, I won't say a word. 
[00:37:30]  I'll just pass by and say, hi.  Keep walking.  Don't blow it.  All right, Douglas.  Okay, I won't say anything.  All right, Douglas.  Thank you.  Okay, be good.  All right, Douglas Montero from the New York Post, Anthony.  There you go.  What a story that is.  I don't know.  It seems kind of scary, though, you know, because they play on the guy's egos,  and you might get yourself in trouble thinking you're just talking to some hot chick.  Also, though, like the hooker could just, you know, lock the doors and then drive you to a scary place.  You may pull that blade out of their mouth and slit your throat. 
[00:38:00]  Anna, what's going on?  A friend of mine just came back from a bachelor party last week, midtown.  Said he had a newfound respect for hookers.  They were driving around in a Lexus.  Oh, really?  Well, that's what we learned.  Nice.  All right, Anna.  We've got to look for these girls.  Got one up here.  How much did that go on?  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, these hookers have been around in cars for years, at least 10 years.  Yeah, a lot of people are starting to say that.  On Lexington, on Lexington Avenue in, like, the mid-30s, they've been around, you know, driving around in BMWs. 
[00:38:30]  BMW, the ultimate boinking machine.  And a fine sponsor of this radio show.  Right.  Yes.  Now, cops can't drive around and get you because that would be entrapment if they asked you if you want to be, Jake.  Right.  So I think you're safe, boys.  Well, we should get a cop on the line.  What do you think you've got?  It doesn't seem like they'd be able to bust you at all when you go up to a hooker. 
[00:39:00]  A lot of times they get a cop.  She poses as a hooker, right?  She's walking around.  You go up to her and proposition her.  Right.  That's solicitation.  But now you've got the hookers in the cars and they're coming right up to you.  And you just think she's a hot chick.  And let's say you're drunk or something.  And you're, let's say you're like Ben.  You're all obnoxious.  And before she says a word, you just go, hey, honey, suck my D.  You know, all of a sudden, hey, look at that proposition. 
[00:39:30]  But you just thought she was some chick.  Yeah, but if they're going to pull up to you and ask you, then their proposition, they're not, you know, it's different.  Cops aren't going to do that.  It doesn't work like that.  Well, we've got to get a cop on the line.  I'm really curious.  I work for PD.  All right.  Well, what, clerical?  Yes.  House boy.  All right, Pete.  Thank you.  We're going to move on to J.R. on 1027 WNEW.  Yes.  J.R.  Hey, what's up?  Thanks for holding that up. 
[00:40:00]  I didn't know where I was, Joey.  J.R.  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  Just quickly, the story that Doug Montero was just talking about with the kids on the experimental drugs.  Yeah.  He actually did this story on me and my family.  Stop.  Yeah.  My son was 16 years old.  He was in a state hospital and he died from an overdose of illegal, well, not illegal,  non-prescription drugs that he was given.  Oh, yeah?  Yes. 
[00:40:30]  What, were they just kind of doing some wacky experiment on him?  Yeah, well, they was experimenting with drugs that they couldn't get legal testing for.  Oh, so they just test them on people that come to the hospital?  Yeah.  So they figure your kid was just whatever, you know?  Well, the article in the paper, the doctor he spoke to said that they were treating him  like he was a raven psychotic.  I had to stop.  That's how strong the medicine was.  I had to stop myself.  But basically, they think some of these kids are just lost causes and they figure, 
[00:41:00]  hey, I might as well get some experimenting out of them before they either die or we just...  Well, the pharmaceutical companies is actually paying doctors for the drugs that they're  experimenting with the kids on.  That's awful.  How's my Pfizer stock?  Sorry.  All right, J.R., thank you for that.  You're welcome.  All right.  All right.  Okay, we finally got going for the NYPD.  Should have said buy them here.  John.  Hey, what's up, O.N., what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, the only way that the cops can do it, you know, the way they do it is when they go 
[00:41:30]  undercover, if a guy mentions what he wants and a price, that's when they get locked up.  As long as you don't mention a price or what you want, you know, you're good.  But what idiot would mention a price?  If you say, yeah, I want a little...  Idiots do do it.  You know, they do do it.  They say, oh, 20 bucks, 20 bucks.  But she's inviting...  20 bucks for a DJ.  She's inviting you into the car.  You know?  Mm-hmm.  They do mention, you know, once they mention a price and, you know, what they want or what 
[00:42:00]  do you get to offer, you know?  And they, you know, usually on the couple cops will be like, what do you want, you know?  Once they say a DJ in, like, 20 hours or whatever, that's when it gets sunk, you know?  Mm.  Where can we get these $20 BJs?  Um, I don't know.  I can't clarify that information, but if you give me another one, I can give that to you.  Oh, good job.  You know what you get to 20 bucks?  You get a nice gumming.  You get Norton.  Norton.  Norton.  All right, guys.  Take care.  All right.  All right. 
[00:42:30]  That's cool.  It's been working a long shift, I guess.  We have Vanessa, who claims to be a transvestite, and she also claims, or he, she, whatever,  claims to be a car hooker.  All right.  Vanessa.  Hi, guys.  How are you?  Stop it.  Stop it.  What's with that?  I'm in my car right now, and this practice has been going on for over three years for me,  but the other caller was right.  It's almost 10 years with the cars.  Vanessa.  Are you pulling our leg?  I'm not pulling your leg. 
[00:43:00]  That's not what I pull.  What are you doing?  Yeah.  What are you?  A transvestite hooker.  Does anyone...  Hi.  My name is Vanessa.  I'm a hooker.  Does anyone...  Right now, right now, I'm in front of Gramercy Park, 21st, between 2nd and 3rd.  I got to say, your voice sounds really hot.  Thank you.  You're a man, and you're not even trying.  You're right.  My name's Sean Ciboney. 
[00:43:30]  You're right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  What an idiot.  Well, once again, we got to move on.  Right, because they reen it, of course.  The call is always reen it, of course.  My goodness.  All right, hold on.  Let me see if Terry has anything.  Terry, what's up?  What's up?  Hey.  How you doing?  All right.  Yeah, I'm down at all.  My friend all the time, he's always on a Coke binge. 
[00:44:00]  You wait by the Hats from 10th to 43rd, and they pull up in out-of-state plates, and they  take you to 50th Street.  Oh, yeah?  Yeah, all the time.  And what goes on on what part of 50th Street?  50th between 11th and 10th.  Down by the UPS building.  Oh, yeah.  Favorite place.  And what are they, um, what do they got, a room there, or just in the car?  Right in the car.  They pull up, you wait in the Hats, they pull up in the Hats, and they say, what's up, you  want to hang out, and you follow them.  The Hats station.  Down to 50th Street. 
[00:44:30]  So you follow them down there, and what, she jumps in your car?  Anywhere by the Edelweiss Diner or the UPS building over there.  And they, what, jump in your car at this point?  Now you go in there, I think.  Thing in the Hats.  They always have, like, Lincoln Navigators and Lexuses and stuff like that.  All right, Terry.  All right.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Sounds like a pro, and that was the exact deal there.  Hey, Ray.  Yeah.  Was that guy full of S?  S.  That's why O.P. said S.  Oh, sorry.  That guy's full of S. 
[00:45:00]  Listen, you know how to find out if she's on the job or not?  How?  You just ask her to show you her box.  If she don't show it, she's full of it.  She's on the job.  Oh, really?  Like a quick flash?  Yeah, show me.  Yeah, copying it.  Show me the money.  Show me the beaver.  And then she'll say, how much?  How much?  No, you've got to pay to see.  And you go, just show me.  Quick flash.  Ah, there you go. 
[00:45:30]  Look at that.  Getting advice from a cop.  Thanks, Ray.  They ain't going to show their box, as he said.  All right, we'll take a break here.  Angela from the HBO Bellevue special.  Yes.  Our new friend, she's coming in, and she'll be here in like a couple minutes.  Cool.  What's wrong, Joey?  No, you don't have to go anywhere.  We just saw her Friday, right there when we were at the Bean Post in Brooklyn.  She showed up there when we were taking the bus around.  Completely normal.  Completely normal.  Yeah.

What voice did you do?  How the hell do you pitch an escort service? 
[00:55:00]  But you can't use the WWF voice.  You can't use the radio guy voice.  No.  Can you use the Hooters voice?  You know what I think it is?  It's very close to the Hooters voice.  I think it's a modified, pleasant cancer read.  Could be.  Yeah.  It is.  It's a modified cancer read.  Yeah.  Because the cancer read is very close.  If you have a problem with metastases of the neck, head, you know, anything like that.  But with this, it's like, hi.  Yeah.  It's if you want big man junk.  It's almost a slightly gay cancer read.

Hopefully it'll be up, because it was, uh, pounded yesterday.  You got your offline now?  Or, I mean, can I, uh, mention it before, uh... 
[01:02:30]  How about you say what you want to say without...  All right, all right.  Without, wait, wait, wait.  Leave the website out.  Yeah, without pointing people on that.  All right, there's, um, an auction for a hot-looking 18-year-old virgin.  It was on the East Coast.  There's a full description, texture, and all.  Yeah.  And, uh, I think the starting bid is $3,100.  Auctioning off her virginity?  Absolutely.  I don't believe it.  It's there.  Do you get a guarantee that, uh, she's a virgin?  Uh, I don't know how you can verify that, but there's a whole bunch of stipulations mentioned 
[01:03:00]  on the site, a criteria for, um, you know, meeting and all that.  They have to be, the winning bidder has to pay travel expenses.  Uh, the girls on the East Coast, uh, you need a medical clearance certificate, uh, which  guarantees you have no STDs, and, uh, it's running, uh, it's running on now.  Actually, I'm getting some pretty high spirits, I'll be.  Now that you mention it, okay, it's me, Patty, and I'm auctioning off my virginity. 
[01:03:30]  I figured, why wait?  I'm getting old, I'm not a spring chicken anymore, so I figured I'd auction it off.  Where's the downside?  Yeah, you get rent money.  She needs rent money.  A nigger gotta eat.  Kevin, we're gonna put you back on with Stinky, so you can give out the website. 
[01:04:00]  Alright, go ahead.  So we can check it out, then we'll give it to everyone else.  Hopefully it comes up.  Alright.  This guy, uh, hold on.  Uh, Craig has more info.  Craig?  Hey, Craig.  Yeah, what's up?  What's up?  How you doing?  Yeah, Dave, this girl says that you gotta, you have to go take a doctor's exam to get tested  for STDs before you meet her, and she'll meet you anywhere.  She pays, you have to pay all her expenses to a hotel, and this and that.  Right.  And she says she can pull out, at the last minute, she can pull out if she wants. 
[01:04:30]  Like, if she says it's too ugly, she can just waste her money.  She wants half up front, and then half after the deed is done.  Now, is there a picture of her?  Yes, there is a picture.  No, no picture.  Just, she's a cute-looking girl, but, I don't know about, the auction's up to $20,000.  Wow.  Alright, Craig, thank you.  Alright, thanks a lot.  I think he's coming in with the website.  Give it to, uh, Anthony.  Alright.  Let me go to Christina.  Christina, what's up?  Christina? 
[01:05:00]  Did we lose Christina?  Hello?  Oh.  Hello?  Hello.  Alright, turn down your radio.  You're on the air.  Oh.  It's down.  It's down.  Oh, well.  Oh, it's already down?  Yeah.  That sucks.  Sean?  Yeah, guys.  Hey.  Listen, there's a bunch of these websites on the internet for escorts.  The key is you have to look for the stamp that says real photo or actual photo. 
[01:05:30]  Places will put a picture of a girl up, like a porn star, put a different name next to it,  and obviously that's not the girl that's going to show up at your hotel.  Well, according to this website, these are the girls you get to meet.  And they verified the photographs?  Yeah.  I don't know.  There's a couple of websites that have Kobe Tide listed as a girl named Lucy Lee or something.  It's a scan from them.  What's in call and VIP out call?  What does that mean?  In call.  In call means that they have either a room or a series of rooms where they'll give you an address. 
[01:06:00]  They don't make you go to a pay phone outside the building.  Yeah.  They can look out the window to see if you're okay.  And what's out call?  They go to your house?  Yeah, they go to a hotel.  VIP out call means it's got to be a highline hotel in the city.  All right.  I'm taking a look now at some of the VIP out call girls.  Blondes.  Okay.  All blondes.  They're all like Playboy models, by the way.  Maybe we can get...  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What's with these chairs? 
[01:06:30]  Sean, have you used this service before?  Uh, my wife sometimes listens to this show, so I really can't talk to you about that.  Yeah, I understand.  Okay.  Yeah, I mean, I've seen them on the internet, though.  All right, Sean.  Oh, try exotic-2000.com.  That's where they have real porn stars.  Okay.  No way you're getting this chick.  Thank you, Sean.  Uh, no way like this chick.  That girl's showing up.  Yeah.  You're calling, she's showing up, and you're, uh, you're having sex with this girl, this Amy girl. 
[01:07:00]  There's no way she looks that good if it is her.  Yeah.  Maybe that was her like ten years ago.  What?  Or who's this chick?  Dude, that could, I mean...  Ben, show Ben the picture again.  No way.  I'll tell you what.  I'll tell you what.  I saw the picture.  But how do you not know that's not like five grand or some ridiculous amount of money?  It could be.  It could be like an insane amount of money that some of these Japanese business guys...  Oi!  ...and they come into town now.  Don't go against a raid.  I need a raid. 
[01:07:30]  Been a long time.  I have a problem with plick.  Christina, don't like frat asses.  Christina.  Hi, Opie.  Hi, Anthony.  Hi, how are you?  I just want to let you know, I used to work for a massage place.  Yeah.  And the cop, one of the cops that busted us, did us all.  What do you mean?  More than once.  Oh, really?  Had sex with us.  Oh, there you go.  So, it's really not about who says what. 
[01:08:00]  Once I saw that, I just got...  Wait, so the cop went in, had sex with most of you, and then finally busted the plate?  Yeah, because it's their word against ours.  Right.  So, they're not going to believe us, you know?  So, it's basically, if you're in there, you'll get busted, too.  So, you have to be very careful.  So, are you still working at these massage places?  No.  No?  Not as I saw that, no.  Did you do the Yankee Cranky?  Of course.  That's what you used to do?  I have no idea what that is, but we did everything.  Yankee Cranky. 
[01:08:30]  Take the cranky and you Yankee.  You know what I mean?  You did everything?  Sure, we did everything.  You did everything?  Yeah.  Like what?  Everything.  Sexual.  Everything that's...  You're paying for her?  No, there's no way you're paying for that girl.  No way.  All right.  Rollerblading.  I'm beautiful.  34C, 2434.  I'd like to show you how sensual and satisfying, playful and tampering European girls are. 
[01:09:00]  What about the S-A or S-F?  I don't know.  What is that in our little profile?  Christina, are you hot?  Very.  And you had no problem working in these places?  No.  I've done massage and I've done escorting.  Yeah?  Mm-hmm.  You're doing everything?  So tell us what goes on with these escort websites.  Well, they're all different. 
[01:09:30]  Yeah.  Two more than others, though.  And everybody's got different prices.  You know, you just have to basically watch out because I believe if you don't get into room,  it's a girl, it's a cop, she can probably screw you, too.  And, you know, it's your word against theirs, so.  Right.  But you have the cool cops, too, that come in and, you know, they don't say anything.  Sounds like you're on a little dope.  No.  Your voice sounds a little bad.  No, I'm fine.  A little tired today?  A little tired from work, yeah.  All right. 
[01:10:00]  Well, thank you, Christina.  Thanks.  What are you doing now?  Huh?  What do you do now?  I'm going home.  Oh, what am I doing right now?  I work for a print shop.  Oh, okay.  Oh, there you go.  All right.  Thanks, Christina.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Where's Earl?  Oh, there he is.  Earl.  Earl, we're going to hook you up.  We're hooking you up with an escort.  You want an escort?  You go out on a date?  It's a new client.  Everything's on the up and up.  You know how clients like to give us a few things?  Like, we got Joey here from Paisanos, right?  If we want to go to Paisanos, maybe we get some complimentary deal or something. 
[01:10:30]  Fine.  What about the Lexus dealer, Andy?  The Lexus dealer?  We gave him the Lexus for a while.  So you can test drive it.  We're going to have you test drive a brunette.  Why not?  What do you think?  It's a client, Earl.  They take you to dinner and stuff.  I smell a setup.  No.  You'll smell something else.  What kind of girl do you want?  White, black, Asian?  What do you want?  Pick it out.  We can pick one out right now.  Blonde.  Give us your wish list. 
[01:11:00]  Give us your wish list.  What do you want?  No African-Americans, I noticed.  What color hair?  I can't say anything.  What color hair?  What do you like?  I'll go dark.  All right.  Dark what?  Brunette, Opie.  White brunette?  I want to go with the sis.  You want a sister?  Well, then, that's just a car ride uptown.  Yeah.  This is a little...  We're talking where the white women at.  This is white.  Look at the side.  It's all white.  White and Asian.  That's about it.  Or you could have a man. 
[01:11:30]  Want a man?  No.  It's just dinner.  Just dinner, maybe some dancing.  You know, what do you say, Earl?  I'm feeling very weird about this.  Pick one out.  Go over to the computer.  Pick out a chick.  Well, wait, Ben.  There is no African-Americans, right?  No.  No.  So you're going to have to go white woman.  Is that all right?  Or you want to do a little Asian action?  White's all right. 
[01:12:00]  White's all right.  Earl.  He's squinting.  Hold on.  Earl.  Get back on mic.  You tell us what you're into.  Are you into blondes?  Brunettes?  Redheads?  I like brunettes.  All right.  All right.  Let's get the brunette.  In call or out call?  You want them to go to your place or a hotel?  Actually, it's not your place.  It's a hotel here in the city.  Or you want to go to their place? 
[01:12:30]  It's like it was 10 years ago.  You better go to their seat position.  You haven't had a woman over in your place ever.  So why don't you go to their place?  How about brunette and call, Anthony?  Paraphrase, Rick.  This is legal, isn't it?  This is a black broker.  Black broker, what's up?  What's going on, O.N.?  Hey.  Listen, man.  I think you better give Earl an instruction manual.  I don't think he's even going to know what to do with a girl. 
[01:13:00]  He already sounds nervous and stuff, right?  That's what I'm saying.  I mean, first of all, he's trying to be politically correct.  Earl, you don't want no system, man.  You just go uptown.  Go for a white girl.  I mean, they're paying for it.  With the jackpot.  I mean, when's the next time Earl's going to get an opportunity like this?  You know what I mean?  Here you go, Earl.  Here it is.  All right.  Thank you, buddy.  I think I found a chick for you.  Celeste Crawford.  Over here.  22 years old.  Hustler Centerfold.  Centerfold of Hustler Magazine. 
[01:13:30]  That's nice, Earl.  22.  Like I said, she's 5'10", 130 pounds.  36D.  2636.  Click here.  This is my New York City date.  All right.  Let's see your city date.  Availability.  It's, um, what was her name?  Celeste.  Celeste.  Doug, what's going on?  What's up, guys?  Hey.  I think he's having a problem because you can't even find one with the penis.  Oh, well, they got that on the site, too, Earl.  You're a loser.  Go home.  Earl, if you don't do this, you're definitely a bone smuggler. 
[01:14:00]  Definitely, if you don't do this.  All right, Doug.  Thank you.  I told himself Doug from Springfield.  Loser.  No, she's not going to be around.  What's the date?  Okay.  All right.  I think I found a date, Erica.  Let's look and see what she looks like.  Let me go.  Oh, look at that.  Oh, look at that.  Turn it around.  Chris, what's up?  Hey, what's wrong with Earl there?  He doesn't want to go on a date with a chick?  It's an escort date.  Nothing happens on these little dates, right? 
[01:14:30]  Oh, come on.  If he doesn't want to go, I'll go.  I don't know.  What's wrong with him?  I don't know.  We're collecting the money and everything.  All right.  Good luck, fellas.  All right, Chris.  I found this chick.  Have you ever been walking down the street and made eye contact with a beautiful woman  right before she walks out of your life forever?  Have you ever wished you had just another minute to get to know her more, Earl?  Now's your chance.  Erica is a lovely girl that you watch out of the corner of your eye when you're standing  next to her on the elevator.  She's that stunning young woman that you see every day on the subway but never have a reason 
[01:15:00]  to speak to.  She's a woman that no man ever forgets.  This is your opportunity to charm the girl of your dreams and whisk her away for a magical,  unbelievable evening on the town.  So stop dreaming about Erica and give her a call now.  She's 20 years old.  20.  5'7", 118 pounds, brunette.  36D, 23, 33.  And she's going to be in New York from 528 to 64.  That's Earl's birthday.  Earl.  When's Earl's birthday?  Earl's birthday is May 28th. 
[01:15:30]  Call me.  We got a number.  We got more pictures.  I'm clicking on more pictures.  All right.  Let's see.  Holy smoking.  Jesus Christ.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Turn around.  Oh, Earl.  Come on.  Earl, look at this.  You want that?  She wants you.  Get the face blown out of that.  You can play.  Look at him.  Oh, please.  What do you think?  It's just barely fuzzed out so she, you know, she can walk the streets, but that is beautiful. 
[01:16:00]  You can play, what, plantation worker and the plantation owner's daughter.  You can do that with her if you want.  Your neck, man, dingo.  You can play convict and the warden's daughter if you want.  Wow.  All right.  What do we have to do?  Do we have to send her an email?  Do we call her?  We can call her at this number.  Rick, call Earl's date.  Here it is.  Earl, this is your birthday present.  And you better appreciate that.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Let me get the number.  Come on. 
[01:16:30]  Hold the phone, God damn it.  There it is.  It's a 212 number, my friend.  And an 888 number.  Or email.  Or right here.  Oh, an 800 number?  No, no.  This one's the 212.  Say you want this chick.  And we want to talk to her on the air, too.  Try to get her on immediately.  Anthony.  How are you doing?  All right.  We'll talk to her immediately.  I got an Asian escort agency.  If you guys are interested, I can bring a girl down tomorrow.  I'll give a China, and what do you do with it? 
[01:17:00]  What's up, Ben?  I got an Asian escort agency.  If you guys want, I'll bring a girl down tomorrow.  I'm in Manhattan.  For Earl?  You own an escort agency?  Yes, I do.  And you'll send an Asian down?  Sure will.  Earl, how about tomorrow with an Asian?  I'm out tomorrow.  What are you doing tomorrow?  No, we'll get a sticker stop and a bar night tomorrow.  Trust me.  You don't have to do the sticker stop.  I got to do the bar night.  It'll be a sticker stop.  You can do that.  I love you a long time, so. 
[01:17:30]  All right.  Hold on, Ian.  Hold on.  All right.  Rick's calling the girl.  We got back.  Earl, I found you a hottie.  I'm not disputing.  Look at this chick, Norton.  Come here.  Norton just walked in.  Earl, are we going to have problems with this or what?  No.  Look at this.  Wow.  Look at that.  You'll be arguing.  Wow.  Come on.  Why are you giving Earl a woman?  Not that I knock that, but why?  Is it a gift for some reason?  Because this is from a new sponsor, and we figured we'd give him one of the perks that 
[01:18:00]  we usually get to enjoy when sponsors come aboard.  We get the pockets full of horny goat weed and whatnot and free dinners at Paisano, and  Earl will get this hot chick.  Rick, did you get a price?  Wait, wait, wait.  Don't show it.  I'm not going to show it.  All right.  So I got my handle.  Joey saw it.  So you called the number?  I called the number and spoke to one of their whore life operators.  Yeah.  And she quoted me a price.  For Erica?  Yes.  All right.  She's not available to talk on the phone. 
[01:18:30]  They just set up the appointment.  What's the two prices for?  One is a cash price, and one is a credit card price.  Oh.  Oh.  A credit card is usually $45, $50 more.  Okay.  Not in this case.  Should we play guess the number?  We should play guess the number.  All right.  Cover it up.  Joey can't play.  Rick can't play.  All right.  Jim can't play.  He's too much of an expert.  Yeah.  You're an expert.  He'll have it down to the penny.  It's funny.  It depends on what state with the tax credit.  Credit cards are usually more expensive, but they'll work out a deal with you. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah.  I'm financing a whore I banged in 95.  He actually has an account for it.  I'm going to his name.  It's called Joseph Goryab.  It'll get you an underage Vietnamese girl.  But is it an hourly rate, or what kind of rate?  Or one hour.  One hour.  One hour with this chick right here.  Now, granted, that is one smoking girl.  With the cowboy hat?  Yeah.  They're all the same chick.  Look.  Right? 
[01:19:30]  All right.  Let's name your price here, people.  All right.  We've got to take a quick break.  Why don't we clear the phone lines, and we'll play guess how much it's going to cost us to  get Earl laid, I guess.  But they can't buy the potty that's on this escort website.  It's a shame they can't see the pictures of her.  I don't get that much, because that would push the price right up.  No, I think people just describe her again.  She's brunette, perfect body, big boobs, young.  She can't be more than 24.  And she has... 
[01:20:00]  Wait, wait, she can't do that.  Yes, Norton, and she has a C.  Oh, sorry.  Yes.  You forgot where he was.  I thought he was doing laundry again.  I forgot you can't do that.  Give me some detergent, you...  Okay.  20 years old, Opie.  Oh, she's only 20.  Just got into the biz.  This is fresh meat.  We're hawking here.  118 pounds, 5'7".  No grizzle here.  36 feet, 23, 33.  And very hot. 
[01:20:30]  Very hot.  Guess how much it's going to cost us to get Earl laid by this girl from this escort service.  For one hour, you get.  One hour.  It's not a night out of dining and dancing with this chick, unless you dine and dance pretty damn fast.  Jim, what if you only need like 10 minutes?  Can you kind of...  No, believe me.  If I had to work at a 30-minute rake, they usually don't go for it.  I know.  30 minutes.  You made a negotiation tactic.  I've attempted it.  Believe me, yeah.  I'm the only guy that brings an arbitrator to a prostitute. 
[01:21:00]  Now, look.  We can work this out.  All right.  We're going to take a break, and we'll start the guessing next.  We have some prizes for this?  Tons, right.  Also, I see Kimmy from Survivor.  We'll talk to her next.  Jim Norton has something to ask Kimmy.  And Angela from the Beltview special on HBO.  Yes.  Busy show today, Ant.  The Opie and Anthony show.  The sickest, most disgusting people having sick sex.  This is going to help us continue to be number one, right, Ant? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah.  Stop me.  This is Scott Stapp.  On behalf of all of us in Creed and my friends at the Hard Rock Cafe and this radio station,  please join us in helping us make a difference in countless lives.  Anthony, New York Sports Clubs.  Every summer, he is born out of a lot of bad legs.  I'm the midriff.  Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.  I love New York Sports Clubs.  That's the truth because they're everywhere, Anthony.  Very, very important if you're trying to get in shape. 
[01:22:00]  I got a New York Sports Club location near my home and one near work here.  So I'm hooked up.  Huntington, Manhattan, they're all over the place.  Last I checked, I think they have over 75 locations growing every day.  They have the state-of-the-art equipment.  They have all sorts of classes you can take, which is cool.  Yeah.  What else can we tell the folks about New York Sports Clubs?  One of the important things, the month-to-month memberships.  Oh, yes, that is important.  No annual contracts or the long-term financial commitments.  A lot of gyms do that. 
[01:22:30]  You're not locked in at New York Sports Club.  You decide how long you want to be a member.  That's it.  New York Sports Club.  You find, like I said, tons of exercise equipment and classes like cycling, boxing, boot camp.  Boot camp?  They do boot camp?  That must be a new one.  Yoga?  That's insane.  Yeah.  Pilates?  Pilates.  Cultural dance and...  I still don't know what Pilates means, and I don't care, so don't call me and tell me.  I'm sure it gets you in shape.  And ultimate conditioning.  We used to say Pilates.  Pilates. 
[01:23:00]  Hey, they got some Pilates.  I love the Pilates.  Cultural dance instead of ultimate conditioning.  Yes, you'll never get bored.  You'll only get fit.  Give them a call.  1-800-301-1231.  That's 1-800-301-1231.  Stop by any New York sports clubs today and join while special joining rates are in effect, Anthony.  To find the New York sports clubs nearest you, give them a call.  1-800-301-1231.  That's 1-800-301-1231.  New York sports clubs.  There's a million reasons to join.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:23:30]  It looks very, very glamorous.  You know why?  I like it so.  Yes, it is f***ing glamorous, all right?  You like the WNEW.  It's ONA on 1027 WNEW.  In the studio, Joey from Paisano.  On Mulberry Street in the heart of Little Italy.  Kimmy from Survivor has stopped in to say hi with her belly sweater.  Wow.  Nice.  Kind of weird to see you with clothes on.  Okay.  And Jim Norton. 
[01:24:00]  Norton called in earlier and said he was going to do his laundry.  I guess he said, F the laundry.  Yes.  Because he heard you were coming in, Kimmy.  Oh, that's very good.  We got something to ask you in a real while.  You didn't tell her, did you?  No.  Okay.  Uh-oh.  Well, we got to finish up with Earl getting laid, though, first.  Anthony, where are we?  Yeah, well, we found out a little earlier in the show that our station, 1027 WNEW, LB.  Oh, very good.  Is accepting sponsors, ads, that we have. 
[01:24:30]  You hear our commercials all the time.  Well, a late night one, one played after 10 o'clock, just going to start in about, I guess,  this week, because Steve was throwing it together, is for an escort service.  Mm-hmm.  An escort service.  Mm-hmm.  We listened to it.  We looked at the website that it points you to, and it's girls that you pay to take  out.  And I wonder what kind of shenanigans happen after.  Sure, they say dining and dancing.  Jeez.  But you're dining for your dining experience. 
[01:25:00]  Yeah, but you're paying a chick to go out with you.  You're going to want some action.  Action.  And that's what this is all about.  And from the looks of some of these chicks, you're going to get some action.  So we figured we'd get Earl laid, because we know he's still a virgin.  And he denies it.  But we like taking some perks from our sponsors.  We've got some horny goat weed right out there.  Look at that.  Norton asked for it.  We got him some.  Yeah, that's a really fair trade-off.  I get horny goat weed, and he gets a $4,000 an hour hooker.  Well, it's funny you mention the price, because we don't know what the price is. 
[01:25:30]  We found this girl, Erica, on the site.  Very hot, 20 years old, 5'7", 118 pounds, 36D, 2333.  And she's going to be in New York later this month.  So we're going to hook her up with Earl.  She'll be here on Earl's birthday.  Right.  Now, where's Earl?  Where is she?  Oh, come on.  Where'd he go?  Such a baby.  Earl, get your ass in here.  So we're going to play Guess the Price, right? 
[01:26:00]  Yeah, so Rick called her up.  Called this chick up, and there's a price.  It's going to cost you to take this chick out.  She's smoking hot.  You go to the website and look.  So now we've got to guess the price.  Rick knows.  No one else knows.  What did he say, Steve?  He's on the phone.  He said he'll be right down.  No, we're in the middle of a bid.  I know.  I told him that.  This is his bid.  Yeah.  He runs away. 
[01:26:30]  White guy.  White guy.  Nope.  Another white guy.  Okay.  No, I see people in the distance.  I thought one of them might be Earl.  That's all.  Oh, there.  Yeah, there's the shadow.  Oh, wow.  Look at the difference, though.  Look, right?  Oh, Jesus.  Because he's way down the hall.  Stay out the bushes!  Earl, so if we can get this money, you're going to go on this date?  Yeah, let's go for it. 
[01:27:00]  She's hot.  Oh, look at you.  Wow.  Let's go for it.  Oh, throwing him a bone.  Guys would kill.  I know.  We're not setting you up with Stalker Patty or anyone or Big Bud Mendy.  Why are they even charging you?  They should copy one, and this way you will talk about the experience and how wonderful it is.  Ah.  Let's see.  Very good.  You're not customers.  You're the hottest show in New York.  Yeah, nice, Norton.  Yeah, see?  They do one, they'll do two.  I mean, that's just the way I'm going to do it.  Right.  And comics should accompany that. 
[01:27:30]  No, I wouldn't say block them.  A true guy.  No, never, never, never.  All right, how are we going to play?  We'll just get, like, five guys and whoever's closest wins.  So here we go.  Some fine prizes.  I have to write down my amount, too.  So give me a pen.  I'm going to write mine down.  Yeah, I want to write a price down, too.  No, you're writing down the usual price, or the price we're giving you?  Oh, believe me.  It's one price.  Yeah, just a regular guy calling.  We're all regular guys.  How long is this for, Rick? 
[01:28:00]  An hour?  One hour.  One hour.  With a 20-year-old just getting started in the biz?  Yeah.  One hour.  Yeah.  All right.  Awesome.  All right.  I got one hour.  I'll take that.  There we go.  Here's my secret ballad.  Okay.  Yeah, write your name on it and hand in your...  Holy crap.  I'm too high, Ben?  I don't know.  Ben.  Great.  All right.  Norton wrote one. 
[01:28:30]  And here's my...  Oh, I didn't write my name on it.  Hold on.  Hold on.  I'll show you my...  I think you're going to do a guess?  Yeah.  It costs 500 bucks.  It's my guess.  It don't matter.  Whatever.  You want to see the picture?  It's my guess.  Kimmy's in.  Okay.  All right.  Here's mine.  All right.  Just write 500%.  It don't matter.  Yeah.  All right.  We'll get five guys.  Five guys.  One closest to the price.  One hour.  We'll win something.  Kevin.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  What's your price for Earl's Escort? 
[01:29:00]  I got to say like $325 an hour, $350 an hour.  $325 an hour.  $325 an hour?  $325 an hour?  He's just making his bet.  Okay.  Or his little...  Hold on the line, Kevin.  Let's go to Jay.  Jay?  Yeah.  What do you want to guess?  You know, I originally was thinking like $800, but she's as hot as you guys are saying.  I really want to go higher, but I'll probably stick with $800.  She's smoking.  She's 20 years old.  And she's flying in?  Yeah.  It's not like she's here all the time. 
[01:29:30]  Damn.  It's got to be way higher.  You know what?  I'm going to say about $1,250.  All right.  Thanks, Jay.  This is for Earl's little date.  He's not even excited.  Steve, what's going on?  Yeah, I say $425.  Hey, guys.  Let's go for it.  I say...  Let's go for it.  I say let's...  Yeah.  Let's do that, Ben.  Okay.  Yeah, I'm in.  Hey, look what she's doing to me.  Hey, well, look at that.  That's the first time that's ever happened.  Steve, what's going on? 
[01:30:00]  That feels pleasurable.  Yeah, I say $425.  $425 an hour?  Yep.  All right.  These guys have girlfriends.  They've never done this before.  All right.  Let's go to Mike.  Mike?  Hey, guys.  I was going to say $375, but the odds are with me if I go $426.  $426?  Look at you playing places right there.  Ah.  All right.  Hold on.  $426.  $426.  Very good.  And let's go to our last contestant, another Mike. 
[01:30:30]  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I'm guessing $550.  $550?  $550.  $550.  All right.  All right.  Okay.  All the guesses are in, Anthony.  All right.  And our guesses are in?  Yeah.  Once again, this girl's 20 years old.  Yes.  Perfect body.  Very, very nice.  Yes.  Look at these pictures.  Big boobs.  She's, uh...  I didn't write my name on mine.  Sorry, I dropped you.  Very hot.  Very tall.  Long legs.  Can you write yours again on mine? 
[01:31:00]  All right.  Uh, Rick?  Do you want me to do yours?  Yeah, come on.  Everybody's first?  And then review the actual price?  Yeah, that's cool.  All right.  Norton guesses $1,200.  All right.  Okay.  Ben, at $450.  $450?  You mean Manhattan for a high-class escort?  Ben.  Opie, what the hell are you thinking?  How much did he get?  Oh, my God.  That's what I said.  You're out of your mind. 
[01:31:30]  What are you, leasing this girl?  For at least $3,500?  He wrote down $3,500.  She's 20 years old.  No one had $3,500.  That's a sheet.  She'll leave her, yeah, well.  Yeah, well.  Thank you.  Yeah, read the dump sheet.  That'll be on the dump sheet on 500music.com.  Great line, though.  Thank you.  She'll leave the little canoe.  The man in the boat.  Yeah.  No, Anthony confused me by saying, you know, you get these really rich Asian businessmen coming in.  And I'm thinking, wow, they had money to burn, so maybe there's a market for this. 
[01:32:00]  Wait till you hear mine.  All right.  I think he went for $500.  $500.  What did Kimmy do?  Let's see.  Kimmy.  Kimmy, what is that?  Is that $12,500?  No, it's $2,500.  $2,500.  $2,500.  $2,500, yeah.  Wow.  She kind of...  And with $2,300.  I said $2,300.  Right in the neighborhood.  Yeah.  I already know I'm way off because Rick knows the price and he goes, what the hell were you thinking? 
[01:32:30]  So I know I'm out.  All right.  You guys ready for the actual retail value of this fine hour?  Oh, fine hour?  Hot chick for an hour.  The cash price on Erica for Earl's date is $1,000.  One grand?  One grand.  How much for credit?  Credit card, $1,200.  Thank you.  Oh, very good.  Wow.  I always pay my credit card.  It's a write-off. 
[01:33:00]  Entertainment.  Wow.  I overbid.  I could get two of these chicks and one chopped off at the throat.  That means...  That means Jay won.  Uh, Jay?  Yeah.  You nailed it.  You nailed it.  Twelve hundred...  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  A little class here.  We're raffling off a prostitute.  Yeah.  Hold on.  Opie, also, Frank gets it, too, because he's had $1,000 cash.  Where's Frank?  He's on line three.  I know.  We didn't go to him.  Oh, sorry, Frank, dude.  We only have these five guys over here, so... 
[01:33:30]  Oh, yeah.  Okay.  Jay gets it.  Jay, what do you want?  We got tickets to see Godsmack at Jones Beach.  We got tickets to see Aerosmith at Jones Beach.  We got wrestling tickets.  We got Depeche Mode tickets.  What do you want?  Uh, give me the wrestling tickets.  Uh, wrestling tickets.  Okay.  Do we have one in there?  Yeah.  Okay, here we go.  You got a pair of tickets to see WWF, Ross Ward, Madison Square Garden, on Monday, June 25th.  All right?  Cool.  Thanks, Jay.  Thank you.  Hold on the line.  Wow.  A thousand bucks now? 
[01:34:00]  All right.  Rick, book it.  We can get a thousand bucks.  We'll scrape it up between everybody here.  Yeah, but what if they want a credit card?  I ain't giving out mine.  Hey, Jim, what is Earl going to get for the price?  What could Earl expect?  Um, I'll be honest with you.  It does depend.  Um, sometimes they try to...  Probably, I imagine it will be a full hour of fun between two people.  Right.  Um, adult entertainment.  Uh, but you have to be careful, because sometimes, at this rate, I don't see a problem.  But sometimes if they want 300, that's just to show up, and they're like, okay, we work on tip.  Ah. 
[01:34:30]  That's exactly it.  But this will not be...  Ah.  This will be a nice time.  And don't take her out to eat, stupid.  You don't have to.  There's no dinner required.  Stupid.  You don't need to buy them dinner.  What if...  Don't buy a hooker dinner, ever.  What if, like, Earl's into, uh, you know, the backdoor thing?  That might...  Well, I'm not a big fan.  I don't really do it.  It's always extra.  I would imagine so.  It's got to be.  And it's called, um, you ask, look, do you speak Greek?  Do you speak Greek?  Do you speak Greek?  Is that the terminology?  Yes, I've used that one.  Do you give Greek lessons?  Um, it's called double entendres. 
[01:35:00]  It's like pig Latin with an erection.  I'm kind of being put off by the fact of, uh, Earl fouling her.  I don't even think...  But who spelled her before Earl?  Exactly.  Miles and smiles.  Lots of miles and smiles.  Now, they're very clean, though.  They're cleaner than most women because they use condoms for everything.  I mean, not that they have sex with you for money.  That's illegal.  But you think a girl that would have done that in her life...  Right.  ...used bags for everything. 
[01:35:30]  Everything.  All right.  Uh, Scott, what's going on?  Yeah, how you guys doing?  Hey.  I just wanted to let you know that, uh, I did this once, and I was really excited to have,  you know, a beautiful girl.  So, and, uh, completed a deed a little early, and, uh, you don't get to go the full hour  once that happens.  I figured Norton probably knows all about that.  Oh, it's the hour or until you're done.  But who is willing to do it?  Yeah, at that point, you just want to leave.  Yeah, the beauty is you don't have to say, get out.  They're willing to do it.  Right.  But if you get excited too quick, though, it ruins the whole, uh... 
[01:36:00]  All right.  Well, thank you, Scott.  No problem.  Thanks, Scott.  I believe we have audio of Earl's Day, Dan.  Oh, we do already before it even happens?  Yes.  I had a glass of ice.  You don't see it in a toilet every day.  What happened?  I had the audio.  Oh, I heard that.  Oh.  All right, we'll have to...  Yeah, go ahead. 
[01:36:30]  All right, we've got to take a break.  Kimmy from Survivor in the studio, Jim Noren, Cowbell Bill, Brother Joe.  Oh, we've got to get Angela in here from the HBO Bellevue special.  Yeah.  We'll do that next and see what she's all about.  John Valby on hold.  And we have something to ask Kimmy.  Valby?  Yeah.  Nice.  That spot gets you every time. 
[01:37:00]  No, why?  Because there's no reason for there to be a pause in that spot.  None.  God, smash it.  Smash it.  Something doesn't apply, I guess.  Sam Adams.  Summer out.  We love Sam Adams, of course.  Drink it all the time.  We had two kegs of Sam Adams on the bus Friday on our party bus.  And wow. 
[01:37:30]  This stuff was great.  Woo!  That's right.  You heard stinky after those kegs.  It was all over, Johnny.  Sam Adams continues to show the world how great American beer can be by winning all kinds of awards at recent international beer competitions.  What have they got?  The Beer of the Year at the Helsinki Beer Festival in Finland.  Five gold medals at the New Zealand International Beer Awards.  And two gold medals at the International Beer Competition in London, England.  Sam sold in 19 countries around the world.  Won more than 200 international awards in the last two and a half years. 
[01:38:00]  More than any other beer on the planet.  And more than any other beer in history.  We love Sam Adams.  And we got a letter today from Jim Cook himself.  Arrived in the office with a couple of nice Sam Adams sweatshirts.  And the letter quickly just goes on to tell us that if we do really good jobs on his reads and contests that are, I don't know, something to do with Sam Adams if we want to do something like that.  Yeah, he advertises all over the country, obviously. 
[01:38:30]  So he's having a little friendly competition between the on-air personalities.  Incentives.  Incentives.  You do a good job.  They have a judging staff.  You really don't hear much about it on the air except for our reads.  But at the bottom, he writes, cheers, Jim Cook.  And then in marker.  And the winning spot cannot involve anal sex.  He had to write that on the bottom.  How many other stations got this?  Probably just hundreds around the country.  Hundreds got, yeah, the form letter.  But the personal note from Jim Cook saying that it should have nothing to do with anal sex. 
[01:39:00]  I believe we'd be the only one.  I cannot think of another station he would have to tag.  And the winning spot cannot, underlined cannot, involve anal sex.  That's like the two radio stations.  You and one on Fire Island somewhere.  Yeah, yeah.  Our station and the one on Fire Island, perhaps.  But we love Sam Adams.  Go out and grab one right now.  I think I'm going to.  Sam Adams.  Hour, hour, hour, hour.  By Opie and Anthony. 
[01:39:30]  Irving, New Jersey, Connecticut, Long Island.  This is 1027 WNEW.  New York.  212-757-1027.  We have a full house today.  Got to try to get to everyone.  We have Jimmy from Survivor, Jim Norton in the studio.  And you're from the HBO Bellevue special.  We're going to get her in in a few seconds here, Ant.  Yes.  But our buddy, our pal, John Dalby's on the line.  We want to play a couple of his tunes before we go to him. 
[01:40:00]  They're short.  Where am I going?  Over here, Rick?  Okay.  I have to be able to play him.  This song is about a cat.  It's about a cat.  You've got to help us out with the radio roll.  Okay, yeah, yeah, right.  She's got the best tongue work that you've ever seen.  She licks both my b****s till they're shiny and clean.  And her pink little pusskies as tight as can be.  I know it's the cat, but it feels like a woman to me. 
[01:40:30]  She rubs on my leg when she wants to get laid.  I duct tape her eyes when I spray her with rave.  She keeps coming back, but that's all right by me.  My girl or my cat, it all tastes like pusskies.  That's John Dalby.  We've got a couple more.  They're short and easy.  More John Dalby.  My poontang has a first name. 
[01:41:00]  It's P-U-S-S-Y.  My poontang has an address.  It's upstairs at the Y.  I love to eat it every day.  And if you ask me why, I'll say.  Because tuna spread, it tastes okay.  Mixed up with my d***s DNA.  And one more before we get to John Dalby, who's on hold here. 
[01:41:30]  Go.  How about the choir sings, I'm not listening.  On her lip, I'm at midnight mass with my best piece of air.  She's whacking on my d***y with her hand.  Can you do that one?  Wait, wait, John.  John.  John doesn't really know the radio rules. 
[01:42:00]  And, well, he shouldn't.  That's okay, though.  You know?  Hey, Mr. Valby.  Hello.  Hey, John.  What's going on?  All right, man.  See how it works?  You come in, you do those live.  No one gets to hear them.  But then we play them with the beeps in.  Yeah, that's beautiful.  Yeah.  I love it.  You know, I think I have a limerick that I can do.  Oh, you do?  You want to give it a shot?  Okay.  Maybe they'll hear it tomorrow.  All right.  Let's play.  While eating, a girl from Iraq, a buzz interrupted my snack. 
[01:42:30]  Now, this was, of course, because she refused to enforce the no-fly zone just south of her  crack.  Did I make it?  Does anyone know?  If not, they'll hear it tomorrow.  You calling us from Buffalo?  Yeah, I'm in Buffalo.  It's beautiful here.  Did the snow finally leave?  Yeah, the snow finally left.  We actually have leaves on the trees and stuff like that.  Oh, wow.  Look at you.  Finally making it into spring.  Yeah, yeah.  You know, our hockey team got eliminated.  You guys follow hockey after the Rangers are gone? 
[01:43:00]  Well, we got the devils.  We got the devils now.  Oh, that's right.  You guys would have kicked our butt anyway.  I'm actually an Islander fan, John.  Yo, you guys had a really bad year.  How about a really bad decade?  That's okay, because he's feeling good about himself now because he's also a Mets fan.  Oh, that's kind of bad.  Mets trying to get themselves out of the basement tonight.  Yeah, I know.  Oh, well. 
[01:43:30]  Hey, John, Timothy McVeigh, was he lived close to you when he was up in the Buffalo area?  He actually did live pretty close.  And Ron, the guy that I go on the road with who helps me write all the stuff, he went to the same high school as McVeigh.  Oh, there you go.  Could have turned him around, but I couldn't.  Nice.  Oh, my name is Robert Blake, and I killed my effing wife.  Then I hid the gun where O.J. hid the knife.  If there's any justice in the good old USA, I'll be executed on a table next to Timothy McVeigh. 
[01:44:00]  Right.  We've got to have him guilty, though, first.  This is America.  You can't prejudge like that.  Right, but what do you think?  Hey, well, you know, if the guy refuses to take a lie detector test, you know, that says guilty to me.  Yeah, that's pretty bad.  Well, he was too upset.  Yeah, you know, that's a load of crap.  But anyway, you know, it's easy for me to say I'm not in that position.  But like those guys with JonBenet's parents, I mean, come on.  The first thing I'd do if somebody killed my daughter, give me any test you want so the cops can move on, you know? 
[01:44:30]  Right, right.  You know, but, you know, it's easy to say from the sideline, I guess.  There you have it.  I don't want to be unfair.  You're coming to town, you're playing Rascals in West Orange Thursday?  Yeah, Rascals on Thursday and then Governors on Friday.  Nice.  So we want some of you crazy New Yorkers to come out.  I do believe you'll have a lot of our listeners.  Oh, yeah.  Both those shows.  Dude, you're one of the funniest, I'm a comic, you're one of the funniest people on the planet ever.  One of the first influences.  You're great.  Well, thank you very much.  I appreciate that.  That's Jim Norton. 
[01:45:00]  I'm really a piano player, though.  Yeah, I know.  You did a thing called Flying, which was more of a serious piano thing on one of your, I think it was on either Dirt or Give Me Dirt or Give Me Decks.  Yeah, it was on Dirt, yeah.  Very good memory.  Yeah, it was one of my favorite things you did.  That and Woman Off, what I did on my sort of vacation.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Cool.  Wow.  Norton's a big fan.  Yeah, look at that.  My God, that's really cool, man.  He's brilliant.  Velvi's brilliant.  He's always topical.  He's always got new stuff.  He's great.  Absolutely great.  Oh, thanks, man.  That makes you feel real good, even here in Buffalo.  Are we going to get you in here this week or no? 
[01:45:30]  You want me to come by?  Well, you know, I can show you the traffic, Friday traffic.  Are you on?  What?  I missed it.  I said, no.  Of course, we'd love to have you.  Okay, well, you know, we can save it for June if you want.  June, you're playing...  Mulcahy sometime in June.  Oh, yeah, they've got a big gig at...  Yeah, I'm hoping you guys are going to, you know...  Yeah, we're going to try to attach ourselves to that mess.  Oh, yeah.  Looks like a tick.  Yeah.  Yeah, a nice summertime bash. 
[01:46:00]  It should be like starting it off.  I think that might be the first day of summer, too.  Oh, wow.  All right.  Yeah, we'll have more details when that gets closer, but Rascals West Orange this Thursday,  Governors in Levittown this Friday.  Right.  And, John, if you can make it in, that'd be great.  If not, we'll wait until June.  Okay.  All right.  Hey, great to talk to you guys.  Anything else as you leave here?  You know, I have one...  Nah, I better not.  You know, it's just not radio-friendly, but it's really funny.  But I'll talk to you next time I see you. 
[01:46:30]  Do you have anything on Survivor?  Because we have the lovely Kimmy from Survivor in the studio.  Oh, no, you know, I kind of bypassed that.  You know, I hate a game where the people you're competing against get to vote you off.  I mean, that sucks.  It hurts.  Yeah.  You know, it's just unfair.  I mean, if you're going to play a game, you know, let me try to be the best or let me survive the best.  But when they, you know, some objective third party should be the voter, not the people playing.  That's my feeling. 
[01:47:00]  You know what?  There's a great topic in there because I did swallow a 14-inch worm, so.  There's plenty of material to work with.  You can write a song on that, huh, John?  Uh, yeah.  You call the song Black Earl.  All right, well, thanks a lot, guys.  All right, John, we'll see you this weekend.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  Rascals West Orange Thursday, Governor's Levittown Friday.  Yes, we're going to get to Angela.  I swear, Angela, hold on.  Yes.  But, I mean, we're on the topic of crazy and sick tunes.  You've got to get your brother in here really fast.  Oh, yeah, where's Joe? 
[01:47:30]  Joe's here.  He's playing Bar 9 tonight.  Again.  He does that, like, every Tuesday, it seems like now.  Every Tuesday he's got the gig now, right?  And we're going down there tonight.  Where is that?  53rd and 9th.  53rd and 9th, Bar 9.  We'll be there, like, 8 o'clock or so tonight.  And I think we have the full band.  Joe, Bill, and Mike, the bass player.  So it's going to be a total plugged-in, like, F-up fest.  But, yeah, so.  Oh, they're probably smoking pot in the stairwell.  Well, do we need him here to play a song? 
[01:48:00]  No, this one, I...  You can set it up.  He watched Schindler's List the other day for, like, the first time.  And most people that watch that are horrified, I guess.  And it's a very depressing, dark movie.  He was inspired to write, like, a peppy little ditty about it.  Joe, grab the mic.  What was your motivation for this song?  What inspired you to watch Schindler's List and then write this?  It was my take on the entire movie, that's all.  It's a little too heavy.  It was a little too heavy of a movie, I think. 
[01:48:30]  Too heavy of a movie.  Lighten it up a little bit, you know?  Lighten it up.  It's about the holocaust.  I understand, but there was something positive that came out of the holocaust.  Without sounding like a fascist...  Even the Titanic kind of lightened it up, you know?  There was something positive that came out.  I wanted to light something positive.  Put a positive spin on the whole, you know, on the whole holocaust.  Sure.  Well, it's a happy little song.  That's right, it is. 
[01:49:00]  I've got to tell you that.  And can the fans find this anywhere, right, Joe?  Not yet?  No.  They'll find it on Napster after this.  They'll find it tonight at 4-9.  You're going to play this at 4-9?  I already plugged your gig.  I just gave it a nice shot in the arm, right before you walked back in.  You should tell people it's every Tuesday night at 4-9.  Yep, every Tuesday.  Tonight, though, is Electric.  Yeah, we're all plugged in.  We're doing Mr. Potato Head.  Okay, here it is.  Joe's brand new song, Brother Joe, if you will.  What's this called?  This one is, well, it's the... 
[01:49:30]  Give the title away.  Yeah.  All right.  If you give the title away.  Here it is.  Here it is.  Well, it's 1944, the white shot's gist.  Poland's invaded by the Nazi blitz.  And all of them are too, yeah, you won't get this.  They got your name on Schindler's List.  When he's gone, and so's your sis.  But there's no reason to cut your list.  Yeah, you're going to live, now you get the gist. 
[01:50:00]  Got your name on Schindler's List.  And I'd have been sent to Auschwitz.  That place is such a gasp.  And you could have caught a bullet in the crack out ghetto.  But Schindler, he saved your ass.  Now you've got a job with a thousand other Jews.  You're eating that mustang, a filter, too.  You thought you were ghetto, but what a twist.  I found your name on Schindler's List.  Okay, terrific. 
[01:50:30]  Very, very good.  You know, when you watch the movie, you don't think of a fun tune like that.  It's kind of fun.  It's kind of nostalgic.  And you really don't get that when you watch Schindler's List.  So the happy people are the people that made it on Schindler's List. 
[01:51:00]  The happy people of the Holocaust.  I just want to lay a pronounced Auschwitz correctly.  You picked up on me, too.  Very happy.  That is a bit frightening.  It's no oh-mine-fure, but, you know, I mean, it's there.  Brother Joe, a big fan of the band Taco.  Now it doesn't sound like that.  Button on the red.  Oh, boy.  Let's see what the folks think.  Tom, what's going on?  What a great talent.  What a wonderful song.  I've got to give it a smash. 
[01:51:30]  I'm 40.  All right.  Thank you, Tom.  All right.  Let's take a break.  We've got to get Angela in here from the HBO build.  Yeah.  She's here.  She's still in HBO.  We'll get her story again in a few minutes.  Also, the rapist from The Sopranos is on hold.  Oh, yeah.  He had a little quote in the paper today.  And we've got Kimmy from Survivor, Jim Morton, and the rest of the gang.  Yes.  And in regards to masturbation, it's a part of human sexuality, and it is perhaps to be  taught.  Against the law.  Then you get arrested for it. 
[01:52:00]  He's the meat.  Stop the dishes.  I have my hand down my pants.  So if you're shaking, now your body's ready for the major pump.  You want the dolphins, jerks the jerkins, ever seen a grown man naked, spanked monkey?  Do you want to touch my monkey?  Opie and that's the meat.  We've got to learn how to do this, dude.  Why did all the dinosaurs die out?  Because you touch yourself at night.  1027-WNEW.  Hey, Anthony, Sobey Beverages, the leader in healthy refreshment.  That's right.

What happened, Rick?  What happened now? 
[01:53:30]  Well, our whipped cream bikini winner was waiting outside over here.  I gave her to Dan so she could fill out her paperwork, and now she's gone.  Oh, yeah?  What do you mean?  Like she went home.  We were going to get her on the air and stuff.  I know!  And present her with her trip to Hawaii.  What happened?  I have no freaking idea.  Where's Dan?  No idea.  Oh, he left.  He better not have gave her her prize and said, well, you can leave now.  I have no idea.  And the girl doesn't listen to the station, so we can't even put out the bat signal, like, 
[01:54:00]  please turn your car around and come back.  Turn around and come back.  Oh, you're missing out on brilliant radio.  Well...  I just stood there, and oh, my God.  All right.  Thanks for coming.  We needed the victory picture.  You know what I mean?  She's really hot.  I'm sorry.  Kim, get...  Kim.  Kimmy, get naked.  Again?  We need a naked person in here.  Kimmy's got to get naked.  She's not around?  Nobody's seen her. 
[01:54:30]  Interesting.  For how long?  God.  For at least 15 minutes.  Man.  Can someone call Dan and see if you sent her home?  Well, he's not going to do it.  Maybe she went to take a leak.  Ooh.  Maybe she'll have to take a dump.  Great.  Where?  Connecticut?  All right.  We'll be back.  1027 WNW.  I'm a Topey radio guy.  I have a Topey radio guy.  I'm just being wacky.  Opie and Anthony show.  We are a bunch of retards.  1027 WNW. 
[01:55:00]  In the studio, Kimmy from Survivor.  Jim Norton.  Joey fights down now.  Let's get Angela in here.  Vinny, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, guys?  All right.  Hey, listen.  Friday night, I'm out to dinner with a few buddies.  And I never watch the show Survive.  But I just know from what I hear, her on the radio.  So my buddy goes, hey, look, it's this Kimmy from Survivor.  I'm like, oh, that's nice.  She's out to dinner with her father. 
[01:55:30]  Well, they're at the bar having a few drinks.  They say, I know.  I see you kissing her father.  But I was just like, oh, I guess they have a special relationship.  My friend Joey.  Before Joey's there, I guess that's her boyfriend.  I don't know.  Me personally.  I don't think she's all that.  I think she's got too many teeth in her mouth.  Who?  Where?  Yeah, you know, Friday night.  You know where you were.  I was there.  No, I don't even know where you were.  So you're trying to say that Kimmy was kissing like an old guy.  I don't know.  He looked to be at least 60 years old. 
[01:56:00]  Where was that?  You know where you were.  I was home at an Italian restaurant.  You know.  No, I wasn't.  I swear.  Because believe me, if I was eating somewhere, I would let you know.  Gosh, what's today?  Taste Tuesday.  It was Friday night.  You were in L.A. on Friday for crying out loud.  You had jeans on and you had like a little shirt and open-toe shoes because I was looking at your feet.  Boy, you just, you know.  You don't like her kids when you were staring at her toes?  Yeah, sure, sure.  I don't know if I can say ass on here, but she had a big ass, too.  She doesn't. 
[01:56:30]  Oh, that's not her.  I'm telling you, everybody in the place saying, oh, that's Kimmy from Survivor.  That's Kimmy from Survivor.  Oh, this is one of those guys that like, yeah, it's her and it's obviously not.  It's so not me because I really knock her out.  Yeah, Friday night you went out with some big pies on.  She doesn't have a big ass.  Dude, I've seen it an inch from my face.  Believe me, I'm telling you.  I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you, I'm telling you.  Everybody would say it was her.  I think there's a little chunk in the trunk if it was her.  Look, if it was chunk in the trunk, but who is this?  Where was I?  Just tell me where I was. 
[01:57:00]  In Cormac.  It's you, baby.  Oh, when I went out with my friend Al?  Ew.  Oh.  Oh.  Yeah.  The shoe comes on now.  I went out.  I was A, I was with my friend Al, and B, the dirty old man next to me was an old customer  mine from a bar that I used to bartend at.  I don't know.  You guys, you guys were kissing.  I see you at the bar doing a little necking.  I gave my hug.  Yeah, I gave my friend a hug.  I did not neck it.  I don't know about a hug.  I don't even go there.  I think there was a little, I think there was a little fiddling going on with the ears there,  too.  What? 
[01:57:30]  This guy was so fixated.  He's right, though.  It was her.  Vinny was good.  I got to give him a hug.  Yeah, you got to give him a hug.  I thought I was lying.  Because you weren't giving details.  I mean, I said she was there with some old guy.  I thought it was her father.  Next thing I know, I see a kiss at her phone.  Hey, the old guy next to me, I'm about eight inches taller than him, and he was like an  old customer of mine.  I didn't know who he was.  Were they swapping you?  Hey, I know the owner over there, because I used to bartend with him, and that's why I  went up there, and I stopped there for like an hour with my friend Al, Mr. Man, whom  I love and adore. 
[01:58:00]  He's a great friend of mine.  Who was that?  The little skinny guy?  No, I was near no skinny guy.  The skinny guy's the owner.  Oh, how many inches of teeth do you have in your mouth?  How many?  Oh, with Jimmy.  Let me tell you, I have big lips that cover them up just fine, but...  Nah, you got way too many teeth, didn't you?  Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, what's your problem with Kimmy, though?  You wouldn't talk to him, that's his problem.  What's your problem with her?  I don't even know the girl.  I used to hear from the show, and you guys say how hot she is.  I saw her in person.  I think she's all that.  She's hot.  She's hot.  Dude, I'm telling you, she's solid.  Let me tell you, on Friday night, because I did not want to go out, and I wasn't feeling 
[01:58:30]  well, but my friend Al was going out, and I went out with my friend Al, ran up out there.  I had a glass of wine, which I don't drink, and yeah, I was wearing a black shirt and  jeans, and I had my hair up, and I didn't want anybody to know who I was.  I didn't see your life coming.  I didn't see your life coming.  I didn't see people like you.  Oh, come on, Kimmy.  Don't get mad at me.  All right, Vinny, thank you.  Goodbye.  You guys are the best.  Please, I'd love to see the battle wagon he's hooked up with.  Now I know where I was at.  I forgot about that.  Well, look at you, forgetting.  I totally forgot.  Were you making out with the older guy, or? 
[01:59:00]  No, and you know, this little old man that was my customer, I'm like, how do I know him?  And he's like, hmm.  He's like, hi, you see my barmaid.  He just squeezes me a little bit.  Wait, wait, the old guy was your barmaid?  No, I was just not.  He just squeezes me a little bit.  Oh, I was there for half an hour.  And you're not the one that was banging another cast member from Survivor and Lotus, right?  Because that made the paper.  That made the paper, yeah.  We want to get all this out in the open, then we can move on.  A certain Survivor girl was with a certain Survivor guy in the bathroom of? 
[01:59:30]  Lotus.  Lotus.  And they got caught having sex.  It was in the post where they don't list the names, but they tell you, you know, they give you enough info.  Oh, that was the guy I used to work with.  No, every time someone's trying to steal my thunder, you know that I would confess.  You know what I'm obsessed up to this.  Who else would have sex in the bathroom of Lotus besides you?  Lotus is in New York.  Besides 12, 12.  Well, Alicia and Jeff live in New York. 
[02:00:00]  Oh, okay.  All right.  But I thought you were canoodling with Jeff.  I canoodled with Jeff, apparently.  But look, this guy just vouched for me.  I was a child baby on Friday.  Oh, this happened Thursday.  Did it happen Thursday night, Ben?  Do we know?  You know, we know Kimmy.  She would confess.  She would.  I would.  Believe me, I would share all this.  You'd fess up.  You'd share it wasn't Richard from the first one taking the can?  Oh, from when I was behind Richard.  I forgot about that. 
[02:00:30]  We've got to say hi to Angela.  She's probably so intimidated to be here now.  Nah.  This is what we do, Angela.  Don't worry.  Just hang out.  Do you know everyone?  Not really.  You should stay away from that guy over there.  You might have seen him walking the halls at Bellevue.  I have a pocket full of meds.  Did you guys see the Bellevue special on HBO?  Kimmy?  No, but I kept talking about it.  And I heard them when they were playing your clips.  And you know what?  I felt so bad.  You might have seen Kimmy having sex in the bathrooms at Bellevue.  Yes.  It was a broom closet. 
[02:01:00]  It was a broom closet at Bellevue.  Was it?  Angela is very lovely in person.  Yes.  All cleaned up and stuff.  All cleaned up.  Well, you were saying in the special that you didn't wash your hair and stuff.  Because that was the least of your problems at the time, right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  So now you're suing HBO.  Yes.  How's that going?  Pretty good.  Yeah?  I have a case.  Definitely.  You definitely have a case.  Get this.  She checks herself in because she's feeling depressed.  And they put her on all kinds of meds. 
[02:01:30]  So you're kind of lethargic just bopping around the halls of Bellevue.  And all of a sudden a film crew comes in from HBO and starts taping everybody.  And either they're having them sign releases or maybe they're having the doctors sign them.  I don't even know how this is working out.  But when you're in that state, you shouldn't have to have a release put under your face.  You're there to try to get better.  And they have you assigning releases.  And then all of a sudden you're out.  It's two and a half years later.  And people all of a sudden are saying, hey, I saw you on a Bellevue special on HBO. 
[02:02:00]  You're like, what are you talking about?  Yeah.  She had no clue.  People just started coming up to her that she knows and says, Angela, you were on HBO last night.  Yeah.  On the Bellevue special.  Because you didn't remember anything in the hospital.  Yes.  No.  I don't remember any cameras or anything.  Really?  I don't remember nothing yet.  You don't remember that big woman with the glasses?  I remember her when I saw her.  Oh, you did?  Yeah, I remember her.  She was a trip.  She really hated me.  She hated you because she thought the doctors were trying to pick you up.  And I was trying to make friends with her, too, because I love everybody.  You had those clips? 
[02:02:30]  It was funny because you're just like, come here, let me give you a kiss.  We need the clip of the lady with the Bubba Ray Dudley glasses.  Yeah, when she was going off and then Angela started singing happy birthday out of nowhere.  That was the funniest goddamn thing.  And everybody was following, really.  Oh, I know.  Oh, you were the ringleader.  She was the ringleader.  Which one is this, Rick?  This is the one where she starts singing happy birthday.  Happy birthday.  No, I want the one where the Bubba Ray Dudley woman thinks the doctor wants Angela.  This is Angela in the studio. 
[02:03:00]  Here's the clip from the HBO Bellevue special.  I can't make Doug.  Yes, you can.  Oh, yeah, because you guys had a little confrontation or whatever.  She said that I got her in trouble and I got her tied up.  Tied up and put in something.  Oh, my God.  I got her in trouble.  She was canoodling in Bellevue.  They tied her up in like a straightjacket and put her in isolation or something.  For some reason, you were responsible for that.  All right, so now they get you two together to try to make up.  Yeah.  I can't make up. 
[02:03:30]  Yes, you can.  Come on.  I don't know what I made up with her because she got me in trouble.  You're a forgiving person.  Not when I was tied down and told her to get in and seducing my camera.  That was a long time ago.  We're going to have to forget about that and work on now.  And you think she's so pretty and you want to seduce her, don't you?  No, I don't.  You have to have the hotspher and everything.  I don't have the hotspher anybody.  No, I don't have the hotspher.  Wow.  Yeah, she had a problem with you. 
[02:04:00]  No doctor was gay then.  And you don't remember drooling on a release form?  Not at all.  Not at all.  So now, yeah, obviously you have a case there.  I mean, that's insane that they would do it.  You go there and get better and they're filming you.  Some of my friends knew about my life and whatever.  But a lot of my friends didn't know.  And every time I walk into, you know, a bar to see my friends, they're like, oh, my God. 
[02:04:30]  And I show you what it is.  I was like, oh, my God.  Did you just get recognized on the street?  No.  Just from my friends.  My friends are telling their friends, their friends, telling their friends.  So they're in each scene.  And I had those ripped pants.  I don't even remember those pants.  They were ripped up to my thigh.  I had whatever.  Nice.  Right, Norton?  Nice.  Nice.  Norton, relax over there.  We got someone so pissed off at us because the day we watched that special and it came  on the air here, we started talking about how easy it probably is to get laid at Bellevue. 
[02:05:00]  Oh, my God.  Because, like, you could just walk in and start talking to the girls and, like, you could just  say anything.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I am Jesus.  And through me, you will be there.  I thought he was God, remember?  Yeah, the God guy.  Yeah, we talked to the God guy.  Oh, God.  And that guy is insane.  That's true.  They filmed it over a period of 12 months, so the people that you saw, I didn't know.  Oh, so maybe you weren't even in there with the guy that, uh...  Yes, I wasn't in there.  ...with this guy.  I hate this place. 
[02:05:30]  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  I remember his voice.  You do?  Of course he does.  The guy was reciting that 40 minutes every day.  That's all you'd have to say.  I saw that guy in the street, actually, like about a year later, and he was haunting me.  He followed me like five blocks.  Really?  I was like, if you don't stop following me, I'm going to call the cops on you.  I was like, please.  Did he remember you?  He was like, Angela!  I was like, oh, no!  I hate this place!  What's going on?  He had luggage with him. 
[02:06:00]  He had a beer.  Lugging.  That's funny.  I don't know why he looked like.  He was hitchhiking.  I don't know.  Well, he had dirt on him.  Make sense.  He hates this place.  He's trying to get out.  Now, does he say nine and a half years, though, since it was two and a half years ago?  David and I have yours.  I hate this place.  Jeez.  We've got a song for you.  Oh, right.  Just a piece of a little song.  Oh, you are.  Oh, my God.  You're terrible. 
[02:06:30]  In the special, you're dancing around in this song.  Oh, my God.  And, well, that was effed off.  You're kind of.  My father is what was a big part of my life.  Yeah.  Whenever it comes to my father, you know, I just love my dad so much.  And with the medication on top of it, you're like, boo.  Yeah.  You know, well, when you're depressed and then they give you that medication, it really brings  your emotions out.  Yeah.  It really does.  Like booze.  Yeah.  It's like, you know, the truth comes out. 
[02:07:00]  Oh, so you're dancing around and you're kind of like putting your arms in the air and crying  and saying, I love you, Daddy.  It was kind of like, oh, Jesus.  Yeah.  What am I watching?  Oh, exactly.  I kind of feel guilty watching it.  You know, you're like, oh.  Yeah.  And then all of a sudden you realize you're whacking it.  You're like, wow.  Yeah, I know.  And then I had my gun in my hand.  Terrible.  I told you, Angela, stay away from him.  Kim, what's going on?  Hey, I have a question.  I don't want to bring up any bad subjects, but what about her cat?  Did they ever find a home for her cat? 
[02:07:30]  I never knew what happened to the cat, actually.  You said that when you took it to the North Shore.  I know a friend told my mom that he put it in the North Shore Animal League.  So I'm assuming, you know, he likes animals, so I'm assuming he did the right thing with the cat.  I'm glad, and I'm glad you're feeling better.  Thank you so much.  That was probably killing me after.  Oh, Jesus.  You're going to send her back.  What is wrong?  No.  No, I'm never going back.  No, look.  She looks like she has a sense of humor.  Yeah.  Yeah.  How long were you in there?  I was in there for about three and a half weeks, something like that. 
[02:08:00]  And then did you get out and have to go back at some point?  No, that was the last time I was actually in there.  That was it?  Yeah, that was it.  Boy, you picked a great last time.  It came in the time before that.  No one would be bothering with this right now.  I know, I know.  You have to be in there during the week when they're doing a big special that airs after  the Sopranos.  You should be happy, though.  What a mess.  This is one comedy 11 years I take in an HBO special.  She tries to open her veins to a Jim Croce song, and all of a sudden, gung her, gung her. 
[02:08:30]  No, that's Jim Croce.  Barry Manilow.  What do you think I'm going to say?  Oh, jeez.  Photographs and memories.  Harry Carpenter.  Harry Carpenter.  Thornton's trying his best.  There's a career going.  There's a comic time for HBO special.  You're there right after the Sopranos.  Funny.  Janelle.  Hey, Janelle.  I know.  Janelle.  Hey.  That's your friend, right?  She just wants to make sure everyone realizes that you're not crazy. 
[02:09:00]  She was.  Something happened to someone.  Yeah, she goes, you're not that psycho.  Only when I try to protect her at a barb roll.  Then I get psycho.  Oh, really?  No, she's like my little sister.  I protect her.  Can you drink these days, or that's you?  No, I really don't drink that much.  No?  Did you, or?  Not really.  Just like on the weekend.  One day out of the weekend.  Hey, you want some pot?  Five beers.  You want some pot?  You got some crank pot, everyone.  I have enough pot friends, please.  Take your little paranoid. 
[02:09:30]  Brian, what's going on?  My friends are out there getting high on coffee and those drinks.  Oh, I know.  They were like shaking their legs.  They were like, I was like, stop it.  We have so many things to make you shake around here.  It's nothing more funny.  We have audio that I'm drinking out there.  I hate this place.  Meditations don't work.  Nothing works here.  I've been here for seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  Seven years.  That's right.  He was from the Midwest or something.  Yeah, he had like a wacky accent.  You're just hating them to help you nuts.  When he called me, he was like in the street, Angela, I was like, oh, my God. 
[02:10:00]  It's that nut from Bellevue.  Oh, wait a minute.  I was in there.  Wait a minute.  Brian.  Hi.  What's up, guys?  We're having fun today.  You guys suck.  I just want to ask Angela if she's worried about, you know, maybe the lawsuit being thrown  out because she went on your guy's show.  Because when Tommy Lee went on another radio show to talk about his videotape, the judge 
[02:10:30]  basically threw it out because he talked about it publicly.  I don't know.  No, I don't think so.  I think it is totally different.  Tommy Lee is, as much as you don't want to believe it, is kind of in control of what he  was doing at the time.  And this is just a case where she was given some kind of legal form, a release form, when  she was in no condition to sign it, and where people are supposed to be protecting you from  anything like that.  That's why you check yourself in there.  Exactly.  It's supposed to be confidential.  Just like when you see a therapist, it's all confidential. 
[02:11:00]  Imagine, Norton, let's just say you're with a hooker.  She straps one on and she starts performing a little anal, right?  And then all of a sudden it's fine and well.  I didn't finish.  You think it's all private, Norton.  All of a sudden you turn on HBO.  There you are in an episode of Real Sex because you were so effed up.  Now, how would you feel about seeing your face there and that being done?  Not as bad as you imagine I'd feel.  No, to be honest with you, I would not allow anything to be strapped on.  I don't think I'd go with that. 
[02:11:30]  No, no, no, no, no, no.  What if you're on this?  That's not what you told me before.  It's very possible.  Again, I'm not just...  Well, wait until the question we pose to you.  Oh, God.  I've got to clear something up.  Steve from across the street.  No, Steve, this is not Tony Soprano's girlfriend from...  Tony Soprano's girlfriend.  Well, Steve's boss.  Gloria.  Yeah, this might be Gloria.  No, no.  Do you watch The Sopranos at all?  Um, yes.  You want to know Gloria, Tony's... 
[02:12:00]  Yes.  ...self?  No.  No, that's...  To me, Chuck.  That's a psychopath.  Throwing meat at his head and coming at him with a corkscrew.  Do you like The Sopranos?  Do you like watching them on the magic box?  God damn it!  You are awful on the magic box.  I carry it with me everywhere I go.  I don't need to either.  It's my friend.  The voices in my head keep me at the...  I'm watching television. 
[02:12:30]  That's a toilet.  Keep it up.  This will get you your special.  Okay.  Steve, what's up?  Steve.  Yeah, how you doing?  Good.  Hey, listen.  Can you guys help us and get that I hate this place clip up on Napster?  I've been looking for it for over a week now.  Yeah.  We can use that all at work, let me tell you.  Why don't we just put it up on soundrymusic.com tonight?  Okay.  Good idea.  And then you guys can put it wherever you want from there, right?  All right.  Thanks a lot.  All right.  Check soundrymusic.com either later tonight or tomorrow. 
[02:13:00]  All right.  You guys suck.  I'm going to go listen to myself.  All right, Steve.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Got to go to I look confused.  That's what they say when they like us.  I know.  Yeah.  Because she's like feeling bad for us and stuff.  No.  That means they like us.  Okay.  Steve.  What?  A bunch of people are requesting that you put that clip on soundrymusic.com.  I hate this place.  What?  The medications don't work.  I'm in my studio with Earl with the door locked.  Wait.  I'm having flashbacks.  Uh-oh.  She's getting flashbacks.  What?  Yeah.  I didn't hear.  Which clip? 
[02:13:30]  I hate you.  I hate you to play.  Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Why are you in your studio with Earl?  Because you won't put my guitar down.  That's all.  Earl plays guitar?  He tries to.  He's trying to work up some talent to kind of make a good impression with the escort girl,  I bet.  I think that's it.  Would you like to leave?  Well, you're actually checking out pictures of the escort girl.  He is?  Yeah.  I think that'll happen.  Ivan.  Oh, and hey.  Hey.  Last time Kimmy called into the show, she admitted that she had slept with a celebrity.  And you said that next time she was in, you were going to play gets who Kimmy slept with. 
[02:14:00]  She not only said that, she said it might not just be one.  I want to give a guess so I can start off the game.  Oh, oh, oh.  Well, what are we going to do, Kimmy?  Um, see, the last time that I talked to you guys, you guys actually called me when I was  in California, and I was completely surprised.  She's red.  You're actually red right now.  I know.  She called her while she was in Bellevue.  As you talk, I'll just set up the wrong buzzer and get my right answer, Belle, and we'll 
[02:14:30]  get right into it.  Please just tell me it wasn't Tommy Morrison or Arthur Ashe.  I...  Oh, God.  I...  Tommy Morrison, what a...  That's good.  You know, I think I have a...  Do you want to play or not?  What are we...  Oh, sugar.  There we go.  All right, we're all set.  Let's start.  Okay.  No.  Uh, well, Jim Noir.  Was it a man or a woman?  Oh, I...  Angela getting right. 
[02:15:00]  Oh, a man or a woman.  Man or a woman.  Man or a woman.  Hang up the phone.  Good question.  Let's start over.  Get the listeners involved.  Oh, no.  Man or a woman?  Um, which time?  No, I'm only kidding.  Oh, oh, oh.  What, Angela?  No, I have very good senses.  Oh.  I'm strictly mad.  Are you sensing something with that?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Wow.  Okay.  This is so catchy.  I'll start with you.  Okay.  Wait, wait.  Wait, wait.  How about we start by guessing the category of celebrities? 
[02:15:30]  Oh, very good.  No, because I can make...  Oh, you know, I'm so not...  Movies?  Movies or television?  Movies?  Movies or television?  They're yes or no answers.  That's it.  The sunglasses will help.  Oh, wait.  Kevin's got a guess.  I'm with Kevin.  Kevin?  Yeah, what's happening, guys?  What's up?  You got a guess?  Yeah, I do.  Robert Blake?  He was in L.A.  I got away.  I got away.  All right.  He's got...  It wasn't Robert Blake.  TV or movie?  Movie. 
[02:16:00]  Person.  Or musician.  Or musician.  Oh, God.  Oh, God.  Okay, you guys have touched on three different categories.  Nice.  Oh, man.  God, I hope comics are in there.  It better not be sports.  It better not be sports.  Just put on her glass.  There's one sports.  Is it sports?  You know, I...  This is such a bad...  Is it a white guy?  I have to have this conversation.  Is it a white guy?  Or black guy?  What sport?  NBA.  It's the NBA.  No.  Good. 
[02:16:30]  NBA?  Shaquille O'Neal?  No.  Oh, my God.  I read in the issue that he's not circumcised.  I am so partial to circumcision.  Ah, there's a hint for you people out there.  There's a hint.  Uncut.  Uncut.  She doesn't like...  No, Stingway.  She doesn't like...  No, Stingway.  I'm sorry.  She doesn't like the peelers.  It's very, very popular in the homosexual male community.  I didn't know that, though.  I have a crew cut.  Most likely, probably.  Wait, how are we going to play?  Because I know some play.  Should we go around the room?  I can't tell you who it is. 
[02:17:00]  Well, we'll guess and we'll look by the utter embarrassment on your face and know that...  There's nothing to be embarrassed about.  Let me tell you.  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  Okay, sports.  Well, let's go with the sports figure first.  Let's go around the room.  That's not a good idea.  Okay.  All right.  It's a sports guy.  I'm going to come right out with a guess.  Is he married?  Is he married?  I don't know.  Dirty girl.  Is it Mike Piazza?  Wow.  She is turning really, really red.  I am very uncomfortable right now.  Oh, my God. 
[02:17:30]  Because it's just an ugly situation.  Tommy Lasorda.  Do you know what?  People are listening.  Is the New York team that he plays for a losing team that practices on Long Island?  Yes.  It's a Long Island duck.  I'd like to make another guess.  O.J. Simpson.  No?  You're his type.  I know.  I know.  Tall, blonde, nice neck.  Mookie Wilson.  Mookie.  Back in the days of the Magic.  No, let's do this.  Sports.  Is it baseball?  Wait.  Is it sports, first of all? 
[02:18:00]  Yes.  One of them is...  One of them?  One of them.  Put the glasses back there.  I did sit next to Magic Johnson on the airplane one.  Oh, no.  Not magic.  Nice.  Oh, it better not have been magic.  No, it was not magic.  I assure you it was magic.  I'll lick your balloon.  Oh, my God.  You are awful.  Maybe, but you touched it the other day.  I know.  I don't care either.  What a way to catch it.  He's stepping on a needle on a Jersey Shore.  All right, Anthony. 
[02:18:30]  There you have it.  You're hearing it here first.  Timmy slept with Magic Johnson.  Magic Johnson.  Woo-hoo!  Oh, man, I'm going to kill you.  That's a ballsy move.  I did not.  I can't believe you said that.  You know every tabloid in the world?  We were on the same plane, sleeping next to each other in our chairs.  Sleeping.  This is what rumors said.  That's what he said.  Sleep.  You slept with Magic Johnson.  Can I talk to Timmy?  Timmy, you forgot a couple of things in my apartment.  I found one of your earrings in my bedroom. 
[02:19:00]  And I also found one of your kidneys that I was punching you with.  I beat her with her own organs.  She enjoyed it.  Oh, yeah.  Uh-huh, uh-huh.  You don't have a cream.  Then I grabbed her around the waist and scaled the large building as she's doing it.  I gave her a lot of cream oil with her own intestines.  I do have to clarify something. 
[02:19:30]  Angela's a fan of Mike Tyson.  Okay.  She's loving that.  Yes?  This could have happened all pre-survivor.  You do know that, right?  Yeah.  Okay.  I just want to make sure that that is laid out on the table.  We'll go pre-survivor.  All right.  Let's cover the sports first.  That means it's a Long Island girl.  All right.  All right.  Cover the sports thing first.  Is it baseball?  It's a New York athlete.  You've got to remember, I also lived in Houston for seven years.  All right.  Is it a baseball?  Is it baseball? 
[02:20:00]  A team Olajuwon.  Holy cow.  I just got to know if it's baseball.  I think I learned how to swallow a 14-inch worm.  Oh.  I am so joking.  Did you pull a train with the Twin Towers?  He was dancing in Olajuwon.  It was those two.  For the love of God.  No, no.  I just need an answer to, is it baseball?  Yes or me.  No, it is not.  Okay.  Okay.  There we go.  Very good.  Is it hockey?  I know how you Long Island girls are with the Islanders.  They love the hockey. 
[02:20:30]  Is it hockey?  It's a hockey player.  It's a hockey player.  It's an Islander.  It's a hockey player?  I have to go for a walk.  It's a hockey player.  Mick Makota.  Mick Makota.  It's a hockey player.  Mick Makota?  Bobby Nystrom.  No, no.  It's Mick Makota.  Look at him.  Mick Makota.  Is it?  Mick Makota.  Mick Makota.  Mick Makota.  Mick Makota.  I love that movie.  I love that movie.  I don't remember the name of it, but I love it.  Lapshot.  Lapshot.  There you go.  Mick Makota.  But you know what?  You also got to remember that at Blue, the club that I'm at. 
[02:21:00]  There's a lot of hockey players that come in there, but they don't speak English,  so.  So is it a hockey player?  Is it a hockey player?  It is a hockey player.  That's obvious.  Okay.  It's definitely an Islander.  Is it an Islander?  What season?  All right.  You know what?  Yeah.  I was so not prepared for this.  I cannot believe it.  Well, we prepare you for it.  We get you right into it.  Facial fears.  What season, Islanders?  I never said that.  I never said that.  I know, but we're assuming and we're right.  What season? 
[02:21:30]  So you know what the thing is?  Is that people now can be involved with somebody that they weren't and they didn't know.  That's okay.  That's all fantastic.  This is pre-survivor.  Ancient history.  Is it the Islanders?  This is such bad radio.  No, no one's turning off their radio.  Okay.  If you don't want to go like right in, is it the Islanders?  I don't know.  How do you not know?  I don't know the name things.  Oh, my God. 
[02:22:00]  Is it a...  You know, when they barely speak English, does it really matter what team that they play for?  Is it a Canadian?  No, it's a Russian hockey player.  It's not actually Russian.  It could have had a very Canadian accent.  It could have been Canadian.  He was cut, though, right?  He was circumcised.  Probably not Russian.  Probably not Russian.  Probably not Russian because Canadians are more likely to be circumcised.  Russians have the skin wig?  A lot of them do.  I'm guessing it's because Canadians have all new terminology.  I like that one.  Nice.  Skin wig is nice, by the way.  Nice.  We like that. 
[02:22:30]  All right.  All right.  Let's think.  I, you know...  I want to go with the post-survivor because that's the interesting one.  All right.  Actor.  I don't know any hockey.  Let's forget about this fourth guy.  We just know it's some schlep hockey player from Canada.  All right.  All right.  Now.  Movies?  Who is this guy in movies?  TV.  TV.  All right.  We got TV.  It's not like I had to get more than this. 
[02:23:00]  No, wait.  Wrong TV.  Is it a series?  Is it a reality show?  Is it a comedy?  A drama?  This is post-survivor.  TV.  I didn't say this is post-survivor, but...  Okay.  It is.  What is it?  A comedy?  All right.  Comedy, drama?  Your secret's good with me.  All right.  Stop nodding.  Okay.  Is it...  Is it Gary Coleman?  No?  Oh, goodness.  Is it Adam Ferrara of the show, The Job?  Seen on ABC?  Wednesday nights, 9.30? 
[02:23:30]  You guys are killing me.  All right.  So it's a...  Okay.  A TV guy.  TV show.  Okay.  Drama comedy.  Drama comedy.  Or is it Angela thinking she was someone else?  Oh, no.  See, when I first met her, she told me her name was Betty.  Okay?  It wasn't somebody from the Bellevue special on HBO?  I missed it.  Actually, you know, I think it was one of the little girls, the queer guy on the, uh...  What was that?  Little Miss America one?  Is it a drama or a comedy?  Yeah.  Drama or comedy?  Drama or comedy? 
[02:24:00]  Seinfeld.  Is it Seinfeld?  He's from Long Island.  Hey.  Seinfeld is from Long Island.  But he likes Jews and I'm not a Jew.  Come on, Kelly.  I don't care.  I'll do anyone.  Come on.  Comedy or drama?  Comedy, drama.  It's a little comedy.  Okay.  It's a comedy.  A little comedy.  Drew Carey?  All right.  Wait a comedy?  Comedy.  Martin.  Comedy.  Martin.  Martin.  Comedy.  Post-survivor.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Comedy.  Think of all the TV shows. 
[02:24:30]  Did you drink of...  Hello, Kimmy.  Oh.  Newman.  Newman?  Hello, Newman.  Oh, hell, hell.  Ew.  I have...  You stuck with Newman.  Oh, hell.  Actually, it was little Timmy from South Park and he just kept going, Kimmy, and I went,  Kimmy.  Yeah.  And it's all done.  Come on.  Who is it?  Hi, look at this time.  We got a break.  No.  Oh.  Comedy.  What network?  I don't know.  Are you thinking I know?  I would...  She snorted.  Snorted.  It was like Chrissy Snow from, uh, Bruce Lee's Company. 
[02:25:00]  Did you drink of that?  Was it Chrissy Snow from...  Let me dance on this.  Hey, uh...  Yes.  Comedy.  Comedy.  Is it still on?  Uh-huh.  Still on a current comedy.  Is it somebody from...  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Kevin James?  No.  King of Queens?  No.  No?  No.  Anyone from the cast of Friends? 
[02:25:30]  Anyone from the cast of Friends?  No, I haven't met any of them.  Kevin James?  Yeah?  No, I...  She's getting uncomfortable with the Kevin James name.  Yeah, there's something really happening with Kevin James.  Local guy.  If you're with Matt LeBlanc, I would tell you, you go, girl.  Kimmy, did you have sex with Kevin James from...  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Wow.  Oh, my God.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Just because you guys are the same high school, different years. 
[02:26:00]  Oh.  You know a lot.  Where are you going?  Where are you going?  Sit down.  The King of Reams.  Wow.  Nice.  Kevin James?  No, there you go.  He's on a very popular show.  But we all know.  Why don't you get him a guest shot on there?  You could be the girl that comes in and ruins his...  Life?  His marriage.  Life?  Oh, wait.  No, that's the show.  Kimmy, take off your sunglasses.  Kimmy, was it Kevin James?  Yeah. 
[02:26:30]  No, he's so lying.  Holy ass.  Kevin James.  What's Kevin James?  But what's he packing?  Yeah, really.  It wasn't the little guy on that show, the same show, King of Cleaners, the little comic  guy?  Yeah.  It's Kevin James.  Oh, but it's Kevin James.  I saw it the second you said that.  Yeah.  And don't worry, Kimmy, when you go to the message board, there will not be any Photoshop  work pictures of you having sex with Kevin James, because those people wouldn't do that. 
[02:27:00]  Kevin, I never, ever, ever said that I have sex with you.  I'm setting the record straight, okay?  You never said it.  We did.  Okay?  Kevin, we said.  No, I did anything to be ashamed of, or anything I was saying.  Oh, my God.  I did not do...  Kimmy's been on our show a lot.  You are really freaking out.  Wow, Kevin James.  Kevin James.  Hey, he's a big star.  The guy's got a hit show.  Could this be a diversion, though?  King of Queens.  From the real person?  No.  No.  You don't think so?  No, we nailed it. 
[02:27:30]  I say nothing.  We nailed it.  Wow.  I am...  That's a charge.  Oh.  Kevin threw his web.  Oh, my God.  That's great.  Great.  Wow.  Wow.  Just reading through.  Like the rest of otherwise?  Yeah.  The other guy.  No!  Why?  Because that's somebody that would really get in trouble, right?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  No, I'm not saying.  Like, you're making it sound like I'm, like, running around. 
[02:28:00]  Movies.  Next guy.  Movies, music, TV.  Was Kevin from Ward-Melville?  Is that where he went to high school?  Oh.  My.  God.  Holy cow.  She's talking with Kevin James.  How does that stay in?  Like, how does Kevin James not go, hey, you know?  Let me just go to Mike.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey.  Hey.  What's going on?  We're hanging with Kimmy.  Listen, I went to Ward-Melville High School, and Kevin Missing and the R.C. Aries, who  on Wall Street, all know Kimmy very well. 
[02:28:30]  Oh, really?  They all know.  They used to go down there?  I graduated with Kevin.  Kevin used to wrestle with mankind.  They were the two fattest guys on the wrestling team.  Uh-huh.  Did you have sex with mankind?  No.  Now, see?  See the difference?  Are you hurt?  No.  I'm looking, kind of thinking she might have.  No, no, no.  No.  No, because they all went to, because my brother went to high school at the same time.  Anthony, let me ask this, though.  Did you sleep with Kevin James? 
[02:29:00]  What's the difference in the relationship?  Holy.  Yeah.  Kimmy, did you sleep with mankind?  No.  I'm not saying anything.  See?  No.  All right, Mike.  Thank you.  All right, thank you.  Thank you.  Thanks, Mike.  Thanks.  A lot.  Here's Kimmy.  I hate this claim.  Nothing works here.  The medications don't work.  I've been here for seven years.  All right, let's take a break, Anthony.  Angela's here from the HBO Bellevue special.  And on the phone, Kevin James. 
[02:29:30]  He was fine.  Kidding, of course.  And we just learned that Kimmy slept with Kevin James.  Wow.  That's amazing.  The king of queens.  God.  See how rumors start?  Was it just canoodling?  Yeah.  What does canoodling mean, by the way?  It means breath lightly while making love.  Yeah.  Because I looked it up in Webster.  Canoodling?  She was hobnobbing.  Hobnobbing.  Yeah, no, I've never heard of canoodling or experienced it.  What's Kevin packing? 
[02:30:00]  Yeah, is it okay?  If you had to guess, what would you say?  He looked like about a six and a half.  He gave it six and a half or 11.  Average?  Above average?  Was he reciprocal to your needs?  Oh, good question.  Oh, boy.  And did Kevin request balloon nut?  Oh, Tim, very good.  Why not?  He got a hot show.  First couple of years, you know, but as soon as you're in the top ten, you start asking  for balloon nut.  Nice.  That's good. 
[02:30:30]  Well, it's to you, Kimmy.  Well, I'm sorry.  What was the question?  Kimmy, comment.  What was you talking about?  You know what?  I'm actually speechless, and had we had this conversation before Survivor, I probably would  have lasted a lot longer.  Yeah?  Yeah, I would have shut up right away, huh?  Kevin.  Kevin.  Kevin.  I cannot confirm or deny anything, because I'm denying this.  I kept it for the same network.  Why would you say I can't confirm or deny?  Why would you even do that?  Because I say nothing.  You guys are just running with this.  Ray, what's going on?  I'm turning on my phone. 
[02:31:00]  Ray?  Yo.  Hey.  Hey, I've been to Wall Street and seen Kevin James there a few times.  He's from right around there.  Yeah, yeah.  I've seen him there.  I think that's the link you guys need.  God, we got that one fast, Anthony.  Yeah.  You know how you know she did it?  Because whenever a girl banged a guy to start talking in military lingo, I did not confirm  or deny the issue.  That's the CBS programming.  You should have just denied.  Yeah.  I denied.  I did deny.  I completely denied.  That's where you went wrong.  Look at you getting in Star Magazine again. 
[02:31:30]  Oh, thank you.  And, you know, I'm going to drag you along.  See, they're going to get more calls saying that Opie and Anthony are using Jimmy.  No.  How did it happen?  Was it just a night out?  Or was it a planned date that happened?  Or did you meet him at the bar?  A little tipsy, maybe out in the car?  Yeah, I know how it came together.  They went to the same high school, so they start talking a little bit, kind of hooked up.  Happened a little bit.  He happens to be at the Wall Street.  Yeah.  I used to work at Wall Street.  I still work at Wall Street.  Yeah, I know.  And he goes there a lot. 
[02:32:00]  Oh, wow, look, Kevin James.  Hey, I went to your high school.  I'm Kimmy from Survivor.  What's that liquid you're dumping in your hanky?  All right.  And then the funny thing is, Norton, did you hear this?  Kevin James actually took out his hog and was just standing at the bar with his junk out,  and he put it on Kimmy's leg.  Yeah.  Just like you did the other day at Dublin Pub.  I just showed up in my meal.  I didn't realize it.  That was funny.  Do you believe that?  That's what he does.  He goes to the bar, pulls his junk out, and then just will lay it on a girl's leg and order a drink. 
[02:32:30]  What a pickup line.  From the side, though, so they really can't feel it.  Right.  So they can't sit next to him in a bar, ever.  It must not be really big if they can't feel it.  Oh, gee.  Good point.  Wow.  She does make a valid point.  I wouldn't do it to her, though.  She's trying to eat it.  What?  Is that a bad thing?  I'm not out of a lesser, okay?  What's the kookier to be in?  Uh, Bellevue, we're here.  You probably hear, like, loonier stuff going on with us, right? 
[02:33:00]  I'm having more fun here.  He's just remembering more here.  He lives as small.  I don't want to have to do it.  That's all.  I don't want to have to do it.  I'll remember this.  I don't care.  I'm not close up on lithium right now.  I just want to live this thing.  I have a small mule.  I'm not doing the Thorazine shuffle.  Do you want any measure, though?  No.  All right.  No.  Kimmy.  Kevin James.  Wow.  Great.  It's a big saw.  The guy's got a hit show.  Kimmy, I got another name for you.  On CBS, the Survivor Network. 
[02:33:30]  Kimmy, could you take the glasses off?  No.  Because the eyes tell it all with you.  I just want to, like, just say a name and see what kind of reaction I get from you.  Okay.  Take your glasses off, please.  Can I do a little bit?  Take your glasses off.  Take a look at Aunt Nye.  All right.  I can't look at you.  She's trying.  She's trying.  What does the name Ziggy mean to you?  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Not the little conister, man. 
[02:34:00]  No.  Ziggy means nothing.  Joey knows.  Ziggy means nothing.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  Ziggy.  No, it doesn't.  No, it really doesn't.  All right.  Mm-hmm.  See the difference, though?  All right.  She didn't freak out like she does when we say Kevin Jay.  Stop it.  You're going to wreck some poor guy's life.  And you know Kevin worked it good, too, man.  He's a little chubby guy. 
[02:34:30]  You know Kevin worked it good.  Oh, boy, Kev.  Did he work it good?  When his publicist calls here, because now all of a sudden you know that somehow someone's  going to call him up and be like, hey, Kevin, you know that chick Kimmy?  And he's going to be like, who?  Oh, no.  He'll remember you.  Yep.  Something tells me.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Oh!  Finger locks.  Oh, you heard that.  What?  She has a nice mouth.  Relax.  Say it a little lower.  I know.  What the F?  Yeah.  She's our friend. 
[02:35:00]  Finger cups.  Can I touch it?  All right.  Should we take a break, yeah?  Yeah, we could take a quick break, I guess.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Kimmy, you can't, ladies.  Kimmy's always a trooper, Anthony.  He's the best.  What are we going to learn next time you come in here?  Oh, boy.  I don't know.  Wow, look at her.  She's all shaken up.  Okay. 
[02:35:30]  Open mouth and tear foot.  Okay.  Well, actually, we have...  Well, that doesn't say it all.  We do have something to ask her, though, when we come back.  You mean you didn't already torture me enough?  No, this would be fun.  Okay.  Well...  What?  If you admit that it was Kevin James, then we can stop the torture right now.  No.  Nope.  Okay.  Okay.  I'll be a brave little trooper.  Okay.  How nice is that to hear?  Who thinks it's Kevin James? 
[02:36:00]  Every single person in the room.  I'm not doing this.  Angela?  Thank you.  Angela, what do you think?  I have to stick up to the lady.  Angela, it's me.  I'm sorry.  It's a chick from Bellevue, man.  Great.  Everyone says yes.  The chick from Bellevue is saying no.  Right.  That's it.  Eight o'clock.  We have an appointment.  Even Kevin James brings his hand to her.  I want to meet some famous people.  I want to get your number.  You have a whole room for... 
[02:36:30]  That will be a show.  I'll almost confess everything.  I'll say it was the drugs.  I'm sorry.  I confess.  I got the laugh that she had on the special.  I have a really deep laugh.  Deep voice.  He's done.  All right.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  Wow.  Okay.  I'll excuse myself for a moment.  No, you can't go anywhere.  I'll be back.  Oh, okay.  All right.  I'm going to go run after that little bald head so I can calm down. 
[02:37:00]  All right.  As we go to break.  Oh, oh, thank you.  That's terrible.  Oh, oh, me.  She just put a hat on that.  Oh, that's terrible.  Give it to your lungs, honey.  Oh, baby.  It's a drop in your heart.  Da-da-da-da.  Daddy, don't.  Daddy, don't. 
[02:37:30]  Oh, look.  Oh, me.  She's all right.  You like her song, all right?  Yeah.  I like the way you're dancing, too, without telling you.  No.  I hope your dancing skills have improved.  I worked at a dancing school for the past few years.  Did you?  Yes.  She's a children.  I really am a dancer and a singer and I play piano.  I'm a real piano player, like the other guy said.  Yeah?  Then tell the little kids, okay, now push your hands in the air and look up and go, I love  you, daddy. 
[02:38:00]  No?  No?  Anything?  I'm cruel.  You're horrible.  Oh, yeah.  Look at that.  She understands I'm just having fun.  You mean it, though.  Angela, you're all right, right?  Yeah.  I'm all right.  I'm all right.

It's the ONA Show.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-3-7. 
[02:40:00]  Kimmy's back in the studio.  She seems a lot more relaxed right now, Anthony.  Yeah.  Just a tad.  Colin, what's going on?  Hey, ONA, you guys are cool.  Thanks.  All right.  I just got a little tidbit that I learned today.  Yes.  And that is that Kimmy is a guilty of an OG.  Thank you.  Thank you.  I'm sorry.  I love you guys.  Peace out.  All right.  No, I have no doubt because you said I will not confirm or deny. 
[02:40:30]  Yes.  That was your slip up.  And if it's a clever ruse to throw us off the track, you're a genius.  Brilliant.  Thank you.  And she'd be given an Oscar.  But we know my next guest.  My next guest was going to be Judd Nelson.  Oh, love him.  Met him.  Love him.  Uh-oh.  No, you could tell by her reaction, though.  She did not get him.  Right, Jim?  I don't know.  I think it's going to be faster to name the people in Hollywood she didn't, though.  I love you.  There's still a third person out there. 
[02:41:00]  It's not Judd, though.  You met him and didn't do anything with him?  No, I didn't.  I got some nice eye candy that night.  I was looking at him.  Mm-hmm.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, but say Kevin James, and she just loses control.  I do not.  You guys just are completely off.  I was like, you just got my hand controlling.  Oh, boy.  Let's go to Eric.  Eric, you're next on 1027 WNEW.  What's up, boys? 
[02:41:30]  Listen to me.  I just have one question.  Please answer this, truthfully.  Do you, um, Bob for Dignity?  Oh.  Oh, Jesus.  Oh, my.  That's a Jim Norton line, Kimmy.  All respect to Jim Norton.  I love the guy.  All right, man.  All right.  A lot funnier when Norton says it.  Yeah, of course.  Angela doesn't know what the hell's going on in here.  That's when your head goes up and down, up and down.  It was funny when Angela walked in.  She noticed the padded walls around the studio that we used to hang up various notes and whatnot.  They're carpeted. 
[02:42:00]  She's like, it should be blue.  That's a calming color.  That one, Mr. Cheswick.  I must say, I think Angela's a new friend of the show, though.  She's cool.  She did.  She took all we got today.  Great.  And she had no problem.  She hugged.  Kimmy, on the other hand.  Wham.  Well, can we ask Kimmy, uh...  Kim, how many times have I been in here subjecting myself to abuse?  Can we ask Kimmy if she wants to...  Quite frankly, I'm surprised that you come back at this point.  Our challenge?  Well, who knows if after this, if I will, for crying out loud.  The challenge is... 
[02:42:30]  Yeah.  We should present Kimmy with the challenge.  Well, Kimmy, you've got...  You're getting to know Jim Norton, right?  Uh-huh.  And he's a cool guy and everything.  I love him.  Yeah.  You love rubbing his bald head.  Oh, I do.  And you've been naked in the bathroom with him.  You've been naked in front of him.  And he was wiping whipped cream out of some of the most intimate of areas on your body, right?  Uh-huh.  Well, come on.  Don't worry.  We're not going to ask you to have sex with Norton.  Right.  It's not where it would be a little awkward.  You two broker that out yourselves.  Right.  But, um... 
[02:43:00]  Broker.  I like that.  Yeah.  Broker it out.  Well, credit card's more expensive.  All right.  Why don't you, you know, snuggle up to Jim as Jim asks you something.  Uh-oh.  Yeah.  Let's have Jim ask her.  I wouldn't say it's necessarily a question.  It's just that if one person from Survivor did something in a bathroom, I think you're better  than they are and you should top it.  I should top it.  Absolutely.  Right.  I should top it.  Now, there is this thing going on that two people from Survivor were having sex in the  bathroom of a certain club.  And it was not me.  And it was not you.  Exactly.  So, we're just thinking, hey, Kimmy should have to top this. 
[02:43:30]  And she says, you know, I'd top it.  And you fess up to her.  So, we're thinking.  Yeah.  Well, Norton, why don't you ask?  It's just that we noticed you drink a lot of water and coffee.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  No, you've noticed.  All right.  I've noticed.  And it's just got to be so lonely going and they're all by yourself and tinkling.  And look, we're just talking as friends here.  Sometimes if you tinkle.  It's just me and you.  Exactly.  All alone.  They're snuggling.  They're snuggling. 
[02:44:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's canoodle.  Canoodling.  Canoodling.  That's like something from a Broadway musical.  Canoodle.  Canoodle?  Something like.  One of those words they use, like in West Side Story or.  Security.  Security.  Code blue.  Code blue.  Oh, that's your straight jacket.  No, I'm kidding.  Oh, come on.  I hate this place.  It's been here seven years.  How do you know I don't like to be restrained?  Oh.  It was all a clever ruse. 
[02:44:30]  Let's play what's in Angela's straight jacket.  Oh, no.  That's funny.  All right, go ahead, Jay.  You're not going to get out of this.  That is.  Okay.  Okay, now, Jim.  Get out of what?  Ask her.  No, her.  Kimmy.  Kimmy.  Oh.  Oh.  And you're saying I need to be committed.  I don't even know what's going on.  No, no, no.  It's just how we were thinking that it would be really good if you topped that.  Like, you know, because a lot of times you go to the bathroom by yourself.  And if you had a friend there laying on the floor and you were tinkling on him, it wouldn't make you.  Right.  But it would make you realize that you had topped those other idiots from Survivor. 
[02:45:00]  You're the only one from Survivor I like.  And I think that would be really good for you.  It's just my opinion.  I mean, just two friends talking.  Kimmy, to put it bluntly, would you please go in the bathroom and use Jim's face as a toilet?  That sounds so much sillier than it really is.  You know, it works best if he's sitting, like, in the shower and I'm standing over him, you know.  It's just my own impression.  She's got a point.  She's got a point.  Sounds like you've done this before. 
[02:45:30]  You know what?  That she's got a point.  With Kevin James.  Kevin likes to be clean.  Oh, my God.  Kevin actually was in that shower on the floor.  No, I think if we pop the lid on the toilet and you put your head, laid it back like you were getting your hair shampooed at the salon.  Let's talk to the guy who's slap happy if you can borrow his product.  And then Kimmy just kind of, you know, baptized you.  Kimmy? 
[02:46:00]  Yes?  To you?  Yes?  Oh, it's to me.  Yeah, it'd be fun.  Baby doll, you know, we've got to practice these things first, okay, in private.  All right?  Oh.  You cannot.  Oh, you just can't do that.  Well, we wouldn't be watching.  Obviously, we'd put a mic in the room.  Yeah, there's got to be a microphone.  Yeah, there would be a mic in the room.  Oh, by the way, yeah, the first picture is up on OPSC.com.  And Kimmy and Kevin James, let's say.  Thank you. 
[02:46:30]  That's very funny.  That's a hoot.  Oh, there's you in your whipped cream bikini.  And Kevin with his arm around you, smoking a cigar.  That's so funny over there.  Because, you know, the whole Monica thing was a very big thing at the time.  Oh, at the time.  Bowensky.  Of the picture.  Yes, yes.  With the cigar.  Kimmy, no problem.  We'll play along and make believe we don't really know.  Okay, thank you so much.  I'll sleep so much there now.  We'll take it.  You know, my father's going to call me again and be like, what did you do this time? 
[02:47:00]  The old guy you were making out with?  Right.  No, no.  No, I'm saying your father.  No.  The guy confused your father with the old guy.  It's not like you told everyone outside the studio when we went to commercial break.  Yes.  What?  I don't think Angela's ever coming back.  Sure she will.  I'll bring her here and I'll protect her.  Smitty.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up, guys?  How you guys doing?  Good.  I just want to tell you a little bit of what I learned today.  Oh, yeah.  We can start a little of that.  In the last hour of the show, I learned that Angela is the only one that doesn't belong 
[02:47:30]  in Bellevue.  I love you, Jim.  See you later.  Thanks, buddy.  Let's go to Bobby.  Bobby, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I learned that Olfee thinks Thornton has a nice hog.  Wait, you can't say that.  Chubby.  He's a fat.  All right, Bobby.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  He's funny, though.  Kevin James is very funny.  Of course.  Let me go to Tom.  Tom, what's going on?  Hey, guys. 
[02:48:00]  What's going on?  Hey.  Listen, I just want people to tell me I look exactly like Kevin James.  I'm wondering if Kimmy can tell us a part by our junk.  Oh.  Yes, his has a lot more money around it.  Uncle John.  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  John, did this sound like anything today, Uncle?  Oh, yeah.  I learned a couple of things today, guys.  All right.  I learned that if you sleep with Kimmy, the whole world will know about it. 
[02:48:30]  And what else?  Let's see.  I also learned that W and EW is just a small part of my large life.  That's right.  That's a way to go.  Remember that.  Uncle John, thanks.  And it's 1027 W and EW.  Yeah.  As per the memo.  I learned once your television show makes it to the top ten, you can ask for the balloon  nut.  Yeah.  Learned that from Norton.  Stalker Patty.  Hello.  Hi.  How you doing?  Hello.  Hi.  How you doing?  Yeah.  I learned that I'm auctioning off my virginity. 
[02:49:00]  I was listening two hours ago.  You get 30 cents for it on eBay.  How old is this woman?  And that's it.  Angela, she's 46 years old.  46 years old.  And she belongs in Bellevue, not you.  No, that's serious.  I don't belong in Bellevue.  Okay.  Well, hi, Kimmy.  How you doing?  Patty, I'm fine.  I just want to say you look very good in your whipped cream bikini.  I give you big props for that.  Thank you.  I need a little credit around here.  Yes.  And Patty, I will give it to you.  Thank you, Kimmy.  No problem, sweetie.  Okay.  Bye. 
[02:49:30]  Maybe I'll see you soon when you come back.  Patty, you really thought you looked good in that whipped cream bikini, huh?  Well, I've got to get to my dinner now, so you have a good day.  With whipped cream on the top and yeast on the bottom.  I'm having lemon chicken with whipped cream on it.  You're having lemon chicken?  Yeah, I make lemon chicken.  I make it good.  Thank you, everyone.  Oh, my God.  Bye, Patty.  Okay, bye.  Have a great day.  Bye.  Oh, wait, Patty?  Yes, what?  What?  Would you tinkle on, Norton? 
[02:50:00]  No.  How about if I lay down in the bed?  Would you do it just for a minute?  No.  No.  Mar, you'll still be a virgin.  No.  But I'm a lady.  You see how she's changing her goddamn voice now?  She really is getting different, yeah.  She totally is changing her voice because I'm imitating her like that.  And now she's like, hi, how are you?  Fine.  How are you, Kimmy?  Hello.  I've got to go eat my lemon chicken.  And it's a sped-up version of, hello, how are you, that she used to talk like that. 
[02:50:30]  Patty, you're starting to cook for yourself.  It's longer than everything, huh?  What?  You're starting to cook for yourself, I see.  Yeah, I've always done that.  I'm a very good cook.  I used to run a kitchen.  We're going to have that virginity thing where we raffle.  What we're going to do is have somebody take your virginity and somebody drink a gallon  of milk quickly, and whoever can hold off puking no longer.  You're real funny, Jim.  You have to smell Kevin James' mule.  He's funny.  Oh, God. 
[02:51:00]  He's very funny.  Yeah, I know.  That's all jokes, right, Patty?  Right.  No truth to any of that.  Patty, just go with Earl.  Make everybody happy.  Oh.  We'll give you $1,200.  Just put the decimal in a different place.  Aw.  I'm a mess.  Good.  You could see me doing that.  What's that?  I could see me doing that.  You're the only one who could.  I know, definitely.  You're right.  I could see a guy paying you $150 for an hour just to smash you around a hotel room.  Oh, no.  I don't want to get hurt. 
[02:51:30]  While he loses money on Monday Night Football.  I don't want to get hurt.  Should I just punch your face and ribs while my team loses by 17?  No.  I can't allow that.  I'm only joking with you.  You know that I really would never do any physical harm to you.  I know.  You're a sweetheart.  I'm only kidding.  Mom, if you're listening, I'm sorry.  I didn't know it was going to be like this time.  The one that's supposed to be crazy is worried about her.  She's on the Bellevue special, but she's apologizing for appearing on this program. 
[02:52:00]  Okay.  That was very proper.  All right, Patty.  Okay.  You have a great night now.  Okay.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye.  You too.  Bye.  Bye-bye.  She'd come in very handy if we needed a virgin sacrifice.  That's right.  People would be running for her.  All of a sudden, you know, someone's going to release the Kraken or something.  Unless you could sacrifice a virgin.  She'd be like, oh, now everyone's calling. 
[02:52:30]  That's right.  Norton pokes his head up and goes, oh, sorry.  I've ruined it for the world.  Norton has limits.  Jason.  I've had tinkle on me, but I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Jason.  It's all right.  It's all right.  What's going on, guys?  Great show today.  All right.  I learned to have a skin wig.  We don't shave the little fellow over and out.  That's good, Jason.  Thank you.  Bye, Jason.  Hey, did you ever peel back the skin wig?  Sorry about that.  I want to know if it smelled like a candy's feet. 
[02:53:00]  Oh, yeah, that's just about enough.  Andy.  Yeah, great show, guys.  All right.  I learned that Kimmy's mouth is big enough to hold a 14-inch worm, her father, and the  king of queens.  All right.  Come on.  Get my father.  Where the hell out of there?  Oh, but you're not denying the other two.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Yes, I am.  Yes, I am.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  Get Daddy out of there.  Come on, that wasn't my father's name.  Who do you think you're playing with? 
[02:53:30]  You ain't fooling out.  I'm playing with fire.  That's what I'm doing.  And I'm getting burned.  Let's go to Dave.  Uh, Dave?  Can people be nice?  Yeah, what's up?  Hey.  All right, guys, I learned that there are a few things.  I learned that Kevin James is on second size, and he's at least 14 inches, and I just  might be not seen quickly now.  Yeah.  Milton hasn't got lead in the walk because he's going after Stoker Patty.  He got everything wrong.  I know.  You really did.  You got everything wrong, and you know, what did we learn?  You have to go back to Opie and Anthony's school. 
[02:54:00]  In a very weird voice, too.  That was an odd voice he had.  He got everything wrong.  Everything.  And I learned that I learned.  I learned.  That guy was in Bellevue.  He was a little calling from Bellevue.  Dan from Hoboken.  I learned not to buy Pfizer or Biomere.  Okay.  Just another newbie.  I learned Jim Cook says anal is not valid.  Not for contests.  Angela.  What are you? 
[02:54:30]  What are you freaking mad?  He's not wearing headphones.  I'm hearing voices.  I have the little voice in your head.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  I don't like bald men.  I'm sorry.  Norton's cursing.  Norton is freaking out Angela.  Cut it out.  Her mom's listening, man.  You're going to ruin it.  She's an adult.  She has to take it.  There you go.  Let's go to Pauly.  Pauly, what's up?  Hey, guys.  What's up?  Hey.  I learned that if you pay for your hooker with a credit card, it's a business expense. 
[02:55:00]  Yes.  Good man.  I also learned that Brother Joe is a bigger anti-Semite than Brian Regan even is.  Oh, Brother Joe.  Should we play Brother Joe's song again?  Well, Tuttle said, I learned Schindler's List just needed a little comedy.  Brother Joe playing Bar 9 tonight, 53rd and 9th, I believe.  53rd and 9th.  53rd and 9th.  It's going to be there.  They're plugging in.  They're plugging in today.  Yeah.  It's all plugged in.  We've got a cowboy bill.  Hey, come on up. 
[02:55:30]  Sing a tune, man.  Angela, if you want.  That's what they do.  Really?  Yeah, yeah.  You go down and you can jam a tune with those guys tonight at Bar 9.  Without a doubt.  Live Bar Karaoke.  This is, uh...  Can I listen to my new single after this?  Yeah, she's actually got a CD to plug.  Yeah.  Really?  I don't have it with me.  It's coming out in about a month.  It's a single.  A CD single.  You want to come back on the show and we'll play it and stuff?  Yeah, definitely.  We'll play it.  Can I come to the release party?  Charles Britt is the, uh...  If you promise not to, you know, have sex with anyone.  Hopi, I have a quick clip.  I have a quick clip from Angela's CD, though. 
[02:56:00]  Okay.  And, believe it or not, I just got it off Napster.  Did you?  I'm going to wish you went to the conference.  Charles!  I'm going to wish you went to the conference.  All right.  What's the name of your CD?  What's the name of it?  Can we ask a name?  I don't even remember.  Angela, what's the name of your CD? 
[02:56:30]  What's the name of your CD?  Bliss.  That's great.  Thank you.  Dan, you come back.  I do vocals on it, but the guy, Charles Britt, is the...  You come back, we'll play the whole song, the song, excuse me, without making fun of it.  Great.  I hope so.  Without making fun of it.  Well, we have to, like, throw that in there, because you know us, you know?  Let's not forget Nikki from We Deliver Teggers.  We tortured the poor girl.  Dan from Hoboken learned that Norton knows a little too much about getting a hooker and  John Falvey CDs.  You want to set up Brother Joe's song? 
[02:57:00]  Get in.  I guess Joe was watching Schindler's List and was inspired to write a happy song.  I don't know.  It's kind of catchy.  You'll be humming this one.  And you're going to be playing this at 4-9 tonight?  50, 30, and 9?  Okay, here it is.  Brother Joe's latest creation.  Well, it's 1944, the right shot's pissed.  Poland's invaded by the Nazi blitz.  And although you let you, yeah, you won't get pissed.  They got your name on Schindler's List. 
[02:57:30]  When he's gone, and so's your sis.  But with no reason to cut your list.  Yeah, you're going to live, now you get the gist.  Got your name on Schindler's List.  And I'd have been sent to Auschwitz.  That place is such a gas.  And you could have caught a bullet in a crack out ghetto.  But Schindler, we saved your ass.  Now you've got a job with a thousand other Jews.  You'll need that much for anger, filter, too.  You thought you were dead, oh, but what a twist. 
[02:58:00]  I found your name on Schindler's List.  How's that for a copper?  Whoa, whoa.  Anthony, there's just a few more, what have we learned, and then we've got to get up and get out of here.  Nice crack out.  Gee from Jersey.  What I learned today, I learned Kimmy took the ultimate survivor challenge by sleeping with Magic Johnson.  I did not sleep.  That's a survivor challenge.  Sometimes they get it wrong, Kimmy. 
[02:58:30]  You know.  We'll defend you.  Can you clarify that one that I did not sleep with Magic Johnson?  Well, maybe he turned off the radio after we told everyone you slept with Magic Johnson.  Magic Johnson.  There's no sleeping when you're worried about getting AIDS, so of course I didn't sleep.  He was a very nice guy.  We sat on an airplane together.  That was it.  You slept next to each other.  You said that, at least.  Well, we both fell asleep, yes.  Next to each other in our own chairs on the airplane.  West Coast Dave from San Fran.  Exactly how bad does Jim Norton want to F Kimmy?  I can hear the anxiety in his voice from here. 
[02:59:00]  How bad would anybody want to say that?  I love him.  There you go.  Good answer.  Kevin James checking in.  Today I learned I am also the king of Kimmy's back door.  Oh, gee.  You didn't give up the balloon, did you?  Kimmy, to you.  Beach Jammer from Midtown.  I learned today Kimmy's a vegetarian, but she likes her meat cut.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh, wow.  Very clever.  Dave from...  Toobstakes.  The listeners are on top of it today. 
[02:59:30]  Dave from Fairfield.  I learned there's an immunity idol in Kevin James' pants.  That's a good fit.  Oh, very nice.  Oh, today I learned the O&A show is worse than Bellevue.  Yes.  My cat from Jersey.  We didn't know, but I guess it is.  You're not mad at me, are you, Angela?  I was just kidding with you.  No, I'm fine.  No, she's totally fine, man.  Don't use the word mad.  What did you say?  Anthony, really fast.  This Thursday, a lot of us will be at the Hard Rock Cafe right after the show, 57th between Broadway and 7th Avenue. 
[03:00:00]  You and I will definitely be there, and whoever's in the area will definitely stop by.  Mm-hmm.  All right?  Okay.  So that's happening.  We don't have time.  We've got to get the hell out of here.  Yeah, we've got to go, man.  How many we got?  We're giving away ten of these?  All right.  We've got ten pairs of tickets to an exclusive listening party for the new Radiohead CD at Lux and Levittown.  It's happening Friday, Ben.  Yes.  Plus, winners will be entered into a drawing to win tickets to see Radiohead when they come to the Tri-State area this summer.  The new CD by Radiohead will be in stores on June 5th. 
[03:00:30]  If you want to check out the album at a listening party on Long Island, give us a call, and we'll give them out to some random callers.  212-757-1027.  John, on line 11, most women don't speak Greek.  That's what he learned.  Oh, beautiful.  Angela, thank you very much.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Have fun.  Thank you.  Kimmy, thank you.  Always, thank you.  Sure, no problem.  Tell Kevin we said hi and come on the show.  Oh, my.  Because he's coming on everything else. 
[03:01:00]  Hey, what?  Like a show.  That's the joke.  Dump out of it and die.  No, don't dump out of it.  Yes, Angela?  I just want to tell somebody something.  Greg, call your daughter.  Okay, thank you.  I can't get in touch with you any other way.  Call your daughter.  Oh, there's something going on there.  Call your daughter.  Uh-oh.  Nothing works here.  I hate this place.  Oh, my God.  Okay.  We'll see you guys tomorrow for Whipping My Wednesday.  Yes.  The Opie and Anthony of Boobies and Whores show. 
[03:01:30]  By 7 o'clock, I think you're going to say, you know what?  I had a pretty good time today.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW. </pre>
