<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast on Monday, July 2nd, 2012, opened with a discussion about the inconvenience of the Fourth of July falling mid-week, followed by a humorous debate on the varying approaches of "cool" and "asshole" bosses regarding holiday time off.  This transitioned into a story about show employee Travisâ€™s struggles entering the building after forgetting his ID, sparking a conversation about building security and its perceived ineffectiveness post-9/11, including reminiscences about a disliked security guard nicknamed "Whitey."

Guest Jim Norton then recounted his star-studded weekend, detailing appearances on *The Tonight Show* with Jay Leno, interactions with Mila Kunis and Justin Bieber (describing the awkwardness of performing for Bieber's young, largely female fanbase unfamiliar with his "happy ending" joke), and the technical difficulties experienced during the airing of his stand-up special on epicshd.com, resulting in angry viewer tweets and frantic calls with his manager.  He further elaborated on his busy Los Angeles trip, mentioning podcasts with Joe Rogan and Adam Carolla, and amusing near-encounters with Kristen Wiig and Cuba Gooding Jr.

The conversation shifted to the hosts' relief regarding a recent FCC court loss concerning explicit content, followed by a critical discussion of the BET Awards. Norton expressed anger at Reverend Al Sharpton receiving a humanitarian award and criticized the overall tone of the event, Jamie Foxx's persona, and the handling of Whitney Houston's tribute.  The movie *Django Unchained* was also briefly discussed. The show then delved into the Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes divorce, focusing on rumors of Scientology's involvement and concerns for their daughter, Suri.  A segment of an interview with a former Sea Org member, detailing the organization's allegedly abusive practices, was played, followed by a caller corroborating these claims.  The segment concluded with further discussion of Scientology and the Sea Org.

The next segment began with speculation about Scientology leader David Miscavige, focusing on rumors surrounding his wife's disappearance and his alleged homosexuality, referencing a *New Yorker* article and Wikipedia.  This transitioned into a comedic comparison between a 50-year-old Tom Cruise and a 50-year-old Wilford Brimley, using photos to speculate on Scientology's potential involvement in anti-aging techniques.  The hosts then reviewed *The Amazing Spider-Man*, humorously criticizing the movie's depiction of Spider-Man's web-shooters, a discussion furthered by caller Danny who clarified the evolution of the web-shooters in comics and movies.

Before the arrival of scheduled guest Dennis Leary, the hosts played his new single/video "Kiss My Ass" from Funny or Die, reacting with laughter and commentary to its irreverent lyrics and visuals.  They also discussed an LMFAO concert, Tiger Woods's golfing successes, and a storm-disrupted golf tournament, all while anticipating Leary's significantly delayed arrival. Once Leary arrived, the conversation involved promotion of his movie and song, further discussion about *Spider-Man*'s production, his stunt work, and various off-topic tangents about aging, his wife's age, and other celebrities. The conversation, as throughout the show, was laced with profanity and sexually suggestive humor.

The ensuing segment largely centered on Leary's film experiences, particularly his role in *Spider-Man*, his stand-up career, and the extensive use of CGI in *Spider-Man*.  He discussed his preference for realistic fight scenes, his aversion to watching his own performances, his thoughts on Obamacare, his dislike of New York City's proposed soda ban, and humorous anecdotes about smoking in inappropriate places and his experiences with Lenny Clark.  He also shared stories about his early work on MTV's *Remote Control*, his experiences with Daniel Craig and Bill Cosby, his charity event Comics Come Home, and a tribute to Patrice O'Neal.  The segment included discussions about voice acting in *Ice Age*, outrageous stunts from the Opie and Anthony show's past, his children, and encounters with basketball stars like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Shaquille O'Neal. Chris Phillips, Leary's co-writer, was also present.

A subsequent segment focused on sports legends' financial situations, the changing dynamics of professional sports salaries, and the lives and personalities of Elvis, Michael Jackson, and Whitney Houston, emphasizing their struggles with substance abuse.  Leary discussed his documentary about his father, a World War II veteran, sharing anecdotes using vulgar language.  Jim Brewer, another guest, promoted his upcoming stand-up special. The hosts and guests also discussed Instagram filters and their teenage experiences.  Leary's song "Kiss My Ass" was played again.

The final segment discussed former show contributors like Limo Ant, Stockbroker Dave, and Spike, lamenting their inability to adapt to the show's style.  The hosts spent considerable time discussing and attempting to share a photo featuring "Some Guy," alongside Jim Norton, Jim Brewer, Tammy Pescatelli, and others. A graphic description of a previous stunt involving a bottle rocket and a woman's genitals was shared, followed by a reading and mocking of listener responses to the "Some Guy" photo.  The show concluded with Jim Norton plugging his upcoming appearances (including one with Bob Saget and Amy Schumer), banter about a potential bunny ranch trip for Opie, a visit to a transvestite bar, and promotions for upcoming events and segments.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Good morning. Welcome aboard.  But enough of this palaver. Let's get the show on the road.  Yes, let's do that.  Hi.  It is Monday, July 2nd, 2012. We are here live.  2012.  People get very confused. They hear our voices. They're like, is it a best of?  What did that happen?  Is it a best of?  Oh, we're here.  Eww, yes.  We are here live.  Live. 
[00:00:30]  Wow.  Well, not too bad since 4th of July is coming up and falls in the middle of the week.  Yeah, it fucks up everybody, doesn't it?  Yeah, it kind of does. It fucks some people up and it makes it better for some people.  Some people take the whole week off. Others just get 4th of July.  You either have a cool boss or an asshole boss.  The cool boss basically gives you the whole week off.  And an asshole boss, an asshole boss, and a cool guy boss. 
[00:01:00]  The cool boss gives you the whole week off and doesn't really fuck around with how many days that means.  Yeah.  You know what I mean?  The asshole boss will fucking, you know, stand at the front door and make sure you check in.  The worst thing about it is, if you have Wednesday off, 4th of July, it's almost useless because you have to get up for work Thursday.  Yes.  And, you know, it kind of limits what partying it could do on 4th of July. 
[00:01:30]  Right.  So, like, what good is it having it so you can hang out Tuesday night?  Right.  And then Tuesday, you want to take off to get ready for the 4th of July.  Yeah.  Well, Thursday.  And then you need the day after the 4th of July to, you know, recoup a little bit.  And it's Friday.  Because you're having a few pops.  You're going to work one day.  And then Friday, it's like stupid.  So the cool boss is understanding.  They go, you know what?  Ah, just take the week off.  Take the week.  Between me and you.  Sure.  No one's looking.  Sure.  Oh, boy, do they look down the hall. 
[00:02:00]  They got a chart.  Let me count.  Count the days.  Where's Travis?  Hi, Jim Norton.  Hi, buddy.  It's Travis.  Travis is off.  Because I wanted to.  I was supposed to be on the list.  I forgot my ID today.  I just ran out.  I'm a big star.  You don't need an ID anymore.  Oh, boy, do I.  That fucking monster downstairs didn't want to let me up.  Really?  Yeah.  They take their job way too seriously.  But, like, how am I not in the system?  I've been working here for years. 
[00:02:30]  Yeah, you should be in the system.  How am I not in the system?  Maybe you should take the hint.  Maybe they are trying to tell me.  Oh, damn.  Take a hike.  So how did you get up here?  Kenny came down and got me.  And said, he's legal.  He's got a show to do.  Let's not dilly-dally.  She's like, you're not in the system.  All right.  But I've been here for years.  Yeah, haven't you seen my face by now?  Obviously, there's an issue that we could just handle right here.  Right here in the lobby. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah.  Right here in the lobby.  Right here in the lobby.  Step out of the vehicle, sir.  Last time I forgot my ID, the guy turned out to be really cool.  He's like, I know you.  I'm like, yeah, and I know you.  Let's just move on now.  That's how it should be, right?  This woman's kind of a douche.  Really?  Woman.  Because let's say.  Yeah, I think she is.  I know.  Let's say you were, God forbid, fired, right?  So they don't want to let you pass the lobby.  I thought of that.  But here's the fail safe. 
[00:03:30]  They would know up here.  So then you would just be stuck in kind of elevator banks with no one allowing you into  any offices.  Nah, but you could always sneak in with somebody.  Just get on with somebody.  Oh.  I thought of that.  Like, I could have been fired or whatever and a disgruntled employee coming back.  But proven their jobs are useless, though.  We don't want any disgruntleds.  That was a whole job that was created after 9-11.  It's a completely useless job.  I don't know why after 9-11.  It wasn't like terrorists were sneaking into offices. 
[00:04:00]  Boy, they thought everything.  They thought terrorists were everywhere.  They really did.  You remember?  You were able to just walk in and out of buildings.  You didn't even check in.  It's like, I'm here to see Mr. Johnson.  Well, go ahead, sir.  That would be floor number seven.  The elevator banks are on your right.  Well, there wasn't there that pain in the ass guy at NEW.  Remember that guy?  I hated him.  Whitey?  We hated Whitey.  Wait, I don't remember Whitey.  The guy with the white hair at the desk at NEW, and if you didn't have your ID out, 
[00:04:30]  he was always fucking ragging us.  Well, that's after 9-11.  No, that was after 9-11, though, right?  Was it?  We did a little time after 9-11.  Yeah, but I don't think it was after.  I think he was right from the start, man.  Really?  He was a perrick.  Then I don't know what I'm talking about.  I hate that guy.  No, I just remember him.  Whitey, we called him, because he had white hair.  Yeah.  He was terrible.  How was everyone's weekend?  I know Jim Norton's was star-studded.  Star-studded.  Between Justin Bieber and Milo Kunis and epicshd.com, you had a very busy few days there, Jim Norton. 
[00:05:00]  Yes, I did.  I would say The Tonight Show was good.  It could have been a disaster.  I was worried about that one, because I knew it was going to be all teenage girls.  And I get there, and the guy, Ross, who works for Leonard, goes, yeah, they were camping out.  Oh.  15-year-old girls.  Oh, for Jimmy.  So I, yeah, no.  No?  Yeah, no.  What?  So I walk in, and it's like, you know how they announced the show?  And when they, like, in The Tonight Show, Milo Kunis, Jim Norton. 
[00:05:30]  Oh.  Justin Bieber.  Ah.  They were all for Bieber.  The demo was not right for you.  Oh, my God.  But it was a much bigger show, so they wanted to put me on that.  They were doing me a favor.  I was supposed to be on Friday with...  That's a massive show, because Milo Kunis is in the big movie, Ted, that's doing very  well.  And then, of course, you got the Biebs.  So I, um...  It could have been a disaster.  I went out there, and I was like, oh, boy, this is nuts. 
[00:06:00]  The second I walked out, my happy ending joke didn't get anything.  And I'm like, do they not know what a happy...  Oh, no.  They don't know what a happy ending?  Like, it wasn't like it was...  It was just like they...  It was another language to them.  It was really bizarre.  So I jumped all over the place.  That was all...  The fact that I pulled out a good appearance...  First of all, they gave me a really good PSA to play.  But it was like one of those things where it was, uh...  That was 20 years of fucking doing stand-up. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like that, in that moment...  And Jay...  You needed all your skills, right?  That was one of those times...  You had to improvise a bit.  Yeah, that could have been death.  Um...  And Jay was kind of laughing at me.  And as we went to break, he goes, uh...  You did a lot better than I thought you were going to do.  He's such an asshole.  Oh, that's funny.  Which was very funny.  Um...  The audience was nothing but 15-year-old girls?  Oh, yeah, they were all for Bieber.  All of them.  And Mila Kunis...  Um...  She felt it, too.  But, I mean, a lot of them like her as well. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah.  Like, she had a huge ovation when she walked out.  But she could...  She was really good to me on the couch.  I like that old lady.  That's what the kids say.  Yeah.  That's what they say.  She's groovy.  She's probably, what, 30, maybe?  She's 28, yeah.  28.  Yeah.  But she was very, very cool to me.  Like, she had fun with my appearance, and that helped me a lot.  Like, Mila Kunis, I will never say a bad word about her.  Ooh.  She was so nice.  And Bieber was actually very friendly, like...  That's his gig, is to be friendly. 
[00:07:30]  But you think, like, I was...  Jay was in my dressing room when Bieber came in.  And then he was like, hey, man.  I gave it to Jay, and he walked in, he said hello to me, he said hello to my agent.  So, like, he was really pleasant to everybody.  You should have punched him in the face, you'd have gotten massive press.  Yeah, I probably would have.  Imagine that.  Just tackle him.  Tackle him, just start fucking shoving your cock in his mouth.  Loves it.  Over and over again.  I imagine that that would have been stopped by somebody.  You gotta at least try, though.  Yeah, give it a whirl.  But he was very pleasant, and... 
[00:08:00]  Everyone says how nice he is.  Yes.  Lovable, and...  I tried to get a picture at the end, like, because the guy wanted to put it on the website,  but he was already doing another interview, and he was gonna sing for people outside.  Oh.  So I didn't really care.  I already have one with him, and it was actually weird.  He's one of the biggest stars in the world, and I didn't...  Oh.  I just...  The one that they tweeted out.  Yeah.  The Tonight Show, where I'm lurking behind Jay.  Well, we made fun of this picture on Friday.  Let me see it.  We're like, we said that you would have wanted to be between Justin Bieber and Jay Leno.  Yeah. 
[00:08:30]  No, I didn't...  Honestly, I didn't care.  It was weird.  It was like...  Because you're in the picture.  It's not a bad picture, actually.  No, it was great.  And that got Twittered out by Bieber.  He tweeted that out, and so did...  I can't tell you...  Did he at mention you?  Did he at mention you?  He did, yeah.  But I was in the at mention originally.  He just retweeted.  Did that get your followers?  Something like that would have given you a shitload of followers a year or two ago.  I probably picked up 2,000 followers, which you get...  Just from that picture.  From appearing with him, yeah.  That's massive.  But we have a different demo.  It's not like the same people at all. 
[00:09:00]  You have a demo?  I don't feel good.  Oh, Jimmy.  I canceled on DeRosa today.  I felt really bad, man.  I'm shooting something with Joe.  Yeah.  But I'm like, I feel much better now than I did last night.  Yeah, you look a little fucking tired.  Yeah, but I was...  I've had a long three, four days, though.  I was genuinely sick yesterday.  I was so mad.  For those of you that the Epic Special didn't work from...  Oh, right.  It actually made me turn off my Twitter, which I rarely do. 
[00:09:30]  On Saturday, I'm like, oh, let me see what's going on.  And they were tweeting me as well.  And I'm like, I gotta just put the phone away for a while,  because I can't even imagine what Jimmy's going through.  Oh, my God.  I was in my car in such a rage.  Here's why I was so upset.  Well, explain to the people that they should know if they listen to the show, but...  The Epic Special aired, my Stan Special aired on Saturday.  And it aired on Epics, but on epicshd.com.  Which is really important.  Very important.  Because Time Warner doesn't get that Epics yet. 
[00:10:00]  Right, and neither does Comcast.  It's going to be in DirecTV in July.  It's getting there.  But it's one of those things where it's building as a network.  So epicshd.com was going to be a huge piece of the show.  Right.  Although they didn't figure it out for Canada, which maybe they weren't allowed to.  But that was a mistake, I think.  But that might be the legal reasons.  So I'm getting all these tweets at 10.01.  Where's the special?  Where's the fucking special?  It's not showing.  It's not working.  Is anybody else not working?  And I got a hundred tweets.  Like, my Twitter blew up. 
[00:10:30]  And so I called my manager.  And I'm not yelling at him.  I was just screaming about it.  Because it just, it was like, I'm such a zero.  Like, of course it doesn't.  Like, of course.  Of course there's a problem.  Why wouldn't there be?  Why would it work?  Why would it work?  Thank you, Elo, for that awesome fucking, whatever.  And I wound up freaking out.  I was actually on my way to Anthony's after doing Spots.  Yes.  I wasn't going to watch it.  I mean, I've seen it.  And I was so, I was in such a rage. 
[00:11:00]  I can't get like that anymore.  No.  I can't get like that.  I was screaming.  I wasn't yelling at Jonathan.  Because again, it wasn't his fault.  Does he know that, though?  Yeah.  And I tell him that in the middle of it.  Like, I say, you know I'm not yelling at you.  I'm yelling about something.  Like, what the fuck?  But I'm not yelling.  You wouldn't think I was yelling at him.  Because I'm not, he didn't do anything.  And I always do that when I'm screaming and my manager or agents hear me.  I'm like, I'm not yelling at you.  You know that this is not directed at you.  Like, just, you know, you have to get it out.  Yeah.  And you can't call up, you know, network people and yell. 
[00:11:30]  But part of me felt good.  Like, there's obviously a much better response than they anticipated.  The, can I tell you, the, the, I did Jay's podcast, which was fucking awesome.  Awesome.  Yeah, really good podcast.  And fucking Rogan's.  Yeah, yeah.  Massive.  People love that one as well.  Now I know what people feel like when they do Opie and Anthony.  Like, when they say like, oh my god, my Twitter blew up.  Because Rogan's, I get a bigger response from him just because it, you live stream first. 
[00:12:00]  So while you're live streaming, you're getting your Twitter hit.  Like, because there are people watching in the moment.  And that fucker has a massive podcast.  Yeah, it's huge.  And, uh.  Is he making money off it?  I don't know.  I should have asked him, but I left right after.  Because I was, it's as busy as I've ever been in LA.  Anyway, I, I landed at, uh, whatever the afternoon was.  And then I went and did Jim Jeffries and Eddie Ift had a fun podcast at their house.  And then fucking Jay came into my room at midnight.  And we did like an hour and a half or an hour and 20 minutes. 
[00:12:30]  He was so cool.  He came to see me at 12.  Wow.  Um.  But it was a fucking podcast.  I did Carolla.  And I told, I asked him, like, why didn't you come on the show?  And he goes, I, I, no one asked me.  Like, he never got the, it's all the, so I forwarded him the email.  Right.  These publicists don't tell people.  That's half the, he goes, I would never say no to that for promotion.  Um.  That's strange.  Yeah.  We just assumed he said no.  No.  No, no.  And I believe him.  So, uh, I did a lot of stuff. 
[00:13:00]  Oh, uh, yeah.  Uh, Jay Moore came to, came to your room at midnight.  Midnight, man.  He's good.  You know, Jay's like all crazy and stuff when you're doing radio.  He's fucking.  He's way different when he runs his own show.  He's a good interviewer.  It's really strange.  He's like very focused.  I'm not saying it's bad when he comes in here all like ADD and all that.  It's fun.  And it's, it's a ride.  But then I listened to his podcast and he's a, he's a very different Jay Moore.  I was on the plane out there and I was staring at this woman cause she looked like Kristen 
[00:13:30]  Wiig.  I'm like, I think that's Kristen Wiig.  Oh no.  Well.  Oh no.  I kept looking at her and she looked at me a bunch of times.  So I'm like, cause I, I, I, a week before when I was going back from LA, I saw, um, I  forgot to, uh, Seth Meyer, um, who, uh, we said hello and we talked the whole walk back.  We'd never met before.  And he was very, talking to me about the president and when he did the, he was just telling me  about the fucking correspondence dinner and he was really a nice dude.  So I'm thinking like she like, Oh, Kristen Wiig.  Yeah.  She probably knows who I am. 
[00:14:00]  But I punked out and I didn't fucking ask her.  Um, I was so mad at myself cause I'm, I know that it was her.  So fucking coming back on coming back.  I see the same woman on my flight and, uh, and Cuba Gooding Jr.  is in the fucking lounge area.  And I don't talk to him cause I assume he's on my plane, which of course he wasn't.  So I blew a chance to meet Cuba Gooding Jr.  But when the lady and I, cause she keeps looking at me.  So she gets on the plane and, uh, me and her the first two to get on and I go, uh, cause 
[00:14:30]  it's just us.  I'm like, are you an actress?  She goes, what?  No.  So she thought I had just been staring at her for no reason.  And the reason she kept looking back at me is because she was uncomfortable.  Oh no, I was so embarrassed.  I love it.  Oh my God.  Dude, I was so, are you an actress?  I love it.  Oh.  That's great.  And meanwhile, and Cuba Gooding, I don't say hi to like a dope.  Who I love.  Oh boy.  You love Cuba Gooding, huh? 
[00:15:00]  He's fucking great, dude.  Yeah.  He's, uh, I mean, I just saw American Gangster again, which he played Nikki Barnes in.  Right.  Which was, I loved, Colin didn't like the movie, but I loved it.  He didn't like that movie.  I thought, when we had Frank Lucas in.  Oh, right.  I was a fucking, uh, that was a good movie, man.  I wasn't here for that one day.  You weren't here for Frank Lucas?  No, I wasn't here.  Um.  Or I was pulling a fez.  I'm not really sure.  Wasn't he in the Boys in the Hood, too?  Cuba was, yeah.  Yeah, yeah.  Did you see, did I talk about it on the air?  I know I Twittered it. 
[00:15:30]  I was watching Boys in the Hood, and there's a scene with Cuba Gooding and Larry Fishburne.  Mm-hmm.  Have I talked about that?  No, I just saw it, though.  Where he goes, uh, he's supposed to go, uh, don't, what are you, because I think Cuba Gooding Jr.  is talking about kids.  And he goes, what are you talking about babies for?  You're using all them rubbers I gave you?  They, they fucking beeped out rubbers.  Ugh.  And they put condoms.  Condoms.  Oh, yeah, we talked about this.  Yeah, I, uh.  Oh, we did?  Okay.  Yeah, I believe so, yeah.  Wow.  I, I just saw it recently on, uh, some shit channel that, you know, obviously cuts things 
[00:16:00]  out.  Oh, it's unwatchable.  Rubbers.  Like, why put the movie on?  You can't say rubbers?  Rubbers.  Yeah, why can't you say rubbers?  All that stuff is just ridiculous at this point.  It is.  With everything you're getting on your iPad and your, on your phones and stuff, it's, you can't  control language anymore.  No.  And most of the stuff being cut out isn't a violation.  Of course not.  It's, uh, it's ridiculous.  Well, we learned that lesson early on.  Yeah.  You get into radio, you worry about the FCC, and then you realize, uh, the real enemy is 
[00:16:30]  the company you work for.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They don't want any, uh.  I dream of the days where all we had to do was worry about the FCC.  Are you kidding me?  Pretty easy to work around them.  We're not even allowed to, like, uh, do anything with a naked girl anymore.  No.  And the FCC will allow that.  And they just lost a big one, too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  The FCC took a huge hit in court.  With a live, uh, live fuck on the air.  It doesn't matter.  We're going to allow live fucks now, right?  And they're not going to look into any more appeals from the FCC about, uh, the Janet Jackson 
[00:17:00]  They've had it down there.  They're like, enough already.  And what the fuck is it?  Like, why would the fucking FCC appeal something?  Like, once it goes through the court system, it's like, just accept it.  What the fuck business is it?  Right.  They made a decision.  Right.  Like, I can understand a company appealing, uh, in court.  Right.  But the government, some government fucking censorship agency?  Well, it's because they don't want to lose their power.  Yeah.  They see that as a slip.  Yep.  Yep.  They see their jobs going away.  Going away. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah, you're right.  Of course they're going to appeal it.  That's all that it's about.  But it's amazing.  They don't have to pay.  That's not coming out of anybody's pocket.  Right?  No.  No.  They're just representing the government and going after a network.  As much as the networks are annoying, they should be reimbursed for that.  If the government goes after you and loses, they motherfuckers should pay you back.  Unelected fucking agency with people that weren't elect.  They were appointed.  Trying to tell you what the fuck?  That's terrible.  It's terrible.  It is.  Scumbags they are.  And they lost.  Good.  Yeah.  That's ancient shit.  That shit's going to go away. 
[00:18:00]  You know how much money was wasted?  Think how long ago the Janet Jackson thing was.  And it's been in court this entire fucking time.  With lawyers working on it.  People from the government working on it.  That's over 10 years now, right?  It's just a waste.  No, 9.  I think it was 0-3.  Close enough, right?  0-3?  So, okay.  9 years.  They fought that.  That's wonderful.  Over a dumb nip slip.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Which was nothing.  Less than a second.  That no one saw until they played it.  Time and time again on the news.  Ad nauseum. 
[00:18:30]  Ad nauseum.  Yes.  Oh, my God.  I watched the wonderful BET Awards last night.  Why would you do?  Black entertainment.  Oh, well, no, why.  I said that.  You want to be angry, I guess.  Well, somebody asked me why I was watching it.  Why not just change the channel?  And I said, my hate is hungry.  My hate needed to eat.  You had to feed your hate, huh?  I have to feed that hate.  Well, BET is just an award show, right?  I mean, isn't it just kind of like every other?  Oh, boy.  Well, one thing they do, they are as boring and self-congratulatory as a white award shows. 
[00:19:00]  But then there's this underlying political fucking tone that goes on.  And there's so many things that annoyed me.  Reverend Al Sharpton getting the humanitarian award was just like, what?  What world do we live in?  And then they actually, the CEO of BET gets up there.  She starts talking about how Reverend Al is there to help people, no matter what their race, religion, sexual orientation. 
[00:19:30]  I'm sitting watching TV yelling at the television.  I'm all in my house yelling.  He never helps people unless they're black.  Stop lying.  Humanitarian award.  And then they did this tribute to Whitney Houston.  And Whitney's mom got up there.  And I tweeted all this.  She sounded like a fucking air raid siren. 
[00:20:00]  She's trying to sing these.  And she's doing like that.  Wait, she's trying to sing Whitney songs?  No, she's singing some tribute song to Whitney.  Oh.  And it was horrible.  I was like, if Reverend Al was a real humanitarian, he'd punch her in the face and knock her out.  B-E-T.  But, uh...  Equal but separate.  One of the, yeah.  One of the most ridiculous things I saw was Jamie Foxx.  Jamie Foxx is just...  He went from being goofball guy. 
[00:20:30]  Mm-hmm.  Uh, what show was he on?  Was he on, uh...  Living Color?  Living Color.  Yeah.  It was Wanda.  Yeah, yeah.  To being, yeah, being wacky cross-dressing guy.  To now he's Mr. Hardcore, pipe-hitting nigga motherfucker.  He's just...  He's the guy.  And he wants everyone to know that he's hard.  Really?  Yeah.  He comes out with a fucking Trayvon Martin shirt on.  Oh, really?  I was like, how about you wear a fucking shirt with a shitload of blacks that were killed  by other black people? 
[00:21:00]  You know, that goes without even a news story.  What are the Trayvon Martin shirts?  It was just a picture of Trayvon in his hoodie.  Nice.  Looking very, uh, young and innocent.  Nice.  Um, so he had that, and I guess because he's in that, uh, that new Quentin Tarantino movie.  You know when he was in Ray, he actually thought he was Ray?  Yes.  He actually fucking thought he was Ray.  He started singing and putting an album out and, like, thought he was Ray.  Actors do that, though.  Yeah.  Well, now he's in this other thing. 
[00:21:30]  What's it called?  Django.  Django.  Django.  Django.  Yeah.  Terrible movie name.  It's, uh, yeah, it's DJ, Django, but, you know.  Oh, shit, he looks hardcore right there.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's got that little fucking Malcolm X beard going.  Wow.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, he's dressed like that for his role, right?  Uh, I don't know.  He's, he's doing, uh, Django.  It's the same guy?  Which is pretty much.  It used to make people laugh?  If you remember the Soul of Nigga Charlie, remember those blaxploitation movies where it's  like the Old West and the black guys are kicking ass on the white people? 
[00:22:00]  Uh, that's what this movie is, really.  It's another one of Quentin Tarantino's kind of looks, uh, he grabs stuff from the past,  sort of that old B-movie shit, and, uh, makes it, uh, modern.  So, they're, they're in the Old West, and he's kicking ass and whipping plantation owners  and stuff, and he actually said that this was like Roots.  He was saying that this movie is like Roots.  It's not like...  Like, why?  Because remember how we all felt when we saw Roots? 
[00:22:30]  Well, let me tell you something.  Django Unchained is like Kunta Kinte.  It's like, really?  Wow.  You're gonna go there?  Trying real hard.  So, there's no comedy in this one either?  I don't know what this is.  Tarantino, this shit is...  I mean, it looks good.  I'll watch...  Oh, Johnny Cage.  Johnny Cage.  What's wrong with you, man?  It's perfect so far.  Yeah.  There ain't no green can hold my body down.  And, uh, what a voice.  Damn it.  Any thoughts? 
[00:23:00]  Good evening, gentlemen.  Amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe it's a specimen I'm keen to acquire.  What's your name?  Django.  Then you're exactly the one I'm looking for.  Hey.  Hey, that's that guy that was in, um...  Calm down.  The guy that held the lamp was a Nazi.  Oh, is that Christoph Waltz?  Yes.  Very well.  I don't know what's happening.  I think he's taking a slave. 
[00:23:30]  Do you know what a bounty hunter is?  We're making him a bounty hunter.  I don't get it.  See, the white guy is making...  Let me give you a reward.  Django, a bounty hunter.  They are bigger than a reward.  I need your help.  I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.  However, I don't know what they look like.  Now the clan's coming through.  Don't you?  Oh, okay.  Is Django an old character?  I don't know who to.  I don't think so.  That means we visit every plantation until we find him. 
[00:24:00]  Once a final Brittle brother lies dead in the dust, I agree to give you your friend...  See, I guess Django was wronged by these brothers.  Right.  And this guy wants to find him and figured the best way to find him would be to get this guy  that was like fucking his...  I guess his chick was killed or something or fucked up or raped or something by this gang.  Okay.  So you get this angry motherfucker that wants to kill these motherfuckers and he's going  to help find them.  But there's a black-white thing.  So is that the conflict?  No.  The conflict is not between that guy and Django. 
[00:24:30]  It's between like the plantation owners and stuff.  Yeah.  We got you.  And the most evil plantation owner is...  What's his name there?  Leo.  Leo DiCaprio.  DiCaprio, isn't it?  Wow.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's him right there.  When they cast these movies, you think they cast white guys that really hate black people?  Oh, so they don't have to act too much?  So the acting is right on.  I always wonder about that.  It's dead on.  You know, some of these scenes where they're whipping slaves and shit, you think the white 
[00:25:00]  actor enjoys it maybe a little too much where everyone on set's like, oh, God.  This could be an explosion.  He's got a heart on again.  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  Do you know when they did, what was the...  Amistad?  Amistad.  They would only let black actors put the chains on and take the chain, or black techs.  Why is that?  I guess.  I don't know.  It's like, you know what?  It's a movie.  Shut up.  Yeah.  I agree.  I got the Al Sharpton BET thing.  Do you?  You want to hear it?  Oh, I certainly do.  I heard it last night. 
[00:25:30]  It was infuriating.  You were outraged.  It's like, why don't they bring up...  In their little montage, they didn't put DeWanna Brawley in there, did they?  How about Greek homos?  Yeah, Greek homos.  When he's helping everyone, do they bring that up?  How about that?  How about fucking...  Well, you've got to forgive eventually.  The race baiting he did.  No, apparently you don't if you're, you know, one-sided.  Well, if Reverend Al forgave Imus after he destroyed his career, then he forgave him.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to destroy the guy's career, and then you can start forgiving.  I don't see David Duke being forgiven.  I don't see David Duke being forgiven for his Klan affiliations when he went to be a legitimate politician. 
[00:26:00]  You're saying there's a double standard, sir?  I think if David Duke ran for any office, black people come out of the woodwork and cry racism, and he's a racist.  But these motherfuckers could say whatever they want about Greek homos and Jaime Town and everything else,  and then they just use, well, that was in the past.  That's their excuse.  Well, how important is a BET award, though?  Uh, apparently not very, because they didn't give out that many.  They didn't give out?  Half the show was tributes and fucking singing. 
[00:26:30]  Really?  Yeah.  Boy, everyone gets out of their chairs.  Why would you watch something like that?  Uh, I have to know what's going on.  No, no.  Racially in the world.  Something a little deeper, I think.  Were there any white people at all?  Yeah.  Oh, there were?  Yeah, Kim Kardashian.  Oh, right.  She's not white.  No, there were white people looking so uncomfortable in the audience.  Because black people, like, they were standing up in the chairs.  Now, you don't see, you know, at award shows where it's usually whitey.  Like, the Oscars.  People aren't standing up and clapping and stuff like that.  Everyone stands up and starts clapping when they're singing. 
[00:27:00]  And then whitey's got to stand up.  And they look so stupid.  They're trying to clap and rock back and forth like black people.  And it's just not working.  Was Kim Kardashian the award?  Yeah, yeah.  Because she kind of likes the black hair.  Well, everybody, every guy that came up to accept an award, much like at the Apollo when you rub the fucking little stump.  Yeah.  You stick your dick in her real quick.  And then you just go up and accept your award.  I knew there was a reason she was there.  Yeah.  Here's Reverend Al getting his dumb award.  Thank you. 
[00:27:30]  Thank you, too.  Thank you.  There's no over-the-top applause for him to say thank you so many times.  No, for him to say thank you twice.  Thank you.  No, no, really.  Really, thank you.  There's a smattering, let's call it, a smattering of applause.  And he's making it sound like the place is losing their minds over him.  Thank you.  Thank you, too.  Thank you.  Thank you to Deborah Lee and to B.T. 
[00:28:00]  In March, when I was headed to Sanford, Florida, I got word going to the airport that morning my mother had died.  And I want to dedicate this to her.  She raised me as a single parent.  Of course she did it.  That's before Jay-Z made Brooklyn famous again.  Woo!  We're there now.  And I wish she would have been there tonight, but I'm glad my daughter's Dominique. 
[00:28:30]  That would have been awkward.  She'd have been a zombie.  I want to thank them.  I want to thank my team at Nash Action Network, Smeika Maury and others.  And we're still out here going to fight.  As Samuel said, we want to protect the vote.  There's all kind of schemes, vote ID, to try and stop us from voting.  And thank God people in the business line.  John Dell, McMillan.  I was talking about it last night.  People in the business.  P. Diddy stepped up.  Andre, Kadar, Massenburg, Don Coleman and others to help us to do this. 
[00:29:00]  We're on the road right now.  And let me tell you, there are people that want to take away our rights.  People want to change Medicaid and Medicare.  And some arguing and back and forth, Jay, about the president.  I support and love the president.  But whatever you do, vote.  Because this election is not just about Obama.  This is about your mama.  Oh, hey.  What did you say about my mama?  And we...  I don't know what that means. 
[00:29:30]  It's not about Obama.  Any better vote or they're going to take all of that from us.  So, Debbie, I thank you.  Most of all, I thank God.  I serve a mighty God.  Yeah.  That...  Yeah.  He knows how to get a black crowd down.  The dollar.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  He's protected me, been better to me than I've been to myself.  Even when I let him down, he never let me down.  That's a white God, by the way.  And I pledge to you that I'll fight every day and keep working.  And every night I go to sleep, I have one thing in mind. 
[00:30:00]  When I wake up the next morning and my feet hit the ground,  I want every bigot, every unjust person in the world to say,  Damn, he's up again.  That's kind of funny.  Ah, Reverend Al.  That's a funny line.  Oh, that Reverend Al.  You know, I...  I can't take him seriously, though.  That was kind of a theme through the show that they were talking about this voter thing.  You know, they're trying to keep black people from voting by saying that you need an ID to vote.  Then how did all the black people vote for Obama? 
[00:30:30]  Oh, fucking no.  I don't think anybody doesn't want black people to vote.  No.  Like, I remember when Hannity, love him or hate him,  when he grills somebody, he is a motherfucker.  And he grilled somebody who was talking about voter scam and voter stuff in Florida  about keeping black people, preventing them from voting.  And the guy who said that, and Hannity goes,  Who's doing this?  Give me a name.  Oh, no.  They're just...  The guy was just vague and vague. 
[00:31:00]  And Sean goes,  Who is doing this?  If they're Republican or whatever, we should go after them.  They have to be stopped.  Give me a name.  Give me a name of someone doing...  And the guy couldn't give him a name.  Because what he wants to say is it's society.  It's just this gray area, evil Illuminati that runs the country that's trying to keep black people from voting by saying that you need ID.  And then if you, if it was a white guy, you said something like,  Why don't these black people get IDs? 
[00:31:30]  You'd be like, Oh, that's racist.  Why are you saying that?  Oh, you're saying all black people don't have IDs?  No, but a disproportionate majority of them do.  Well, that's racist.  Well, then how come you're bitching about IDs?  And if you don't have an ID to vote, then it's racist.  It goes both ways.  The fuck?  But get a fucking ID.  Get a fucking ID.  But I think there's some people in society that don't want to have an ID that perhaps, you know, they got some shenanigans going on and want to stay under the radar. 
[00:32:00]  Yet they want to still be counted as a voter.  Stop it.  Very confusing.  No one's trying to steal your vote.  Very confusing.  Yeah.  By the way, off the subject, Alec Baldwin's wife is fucking beautiful.  Let me say, what is that?  Holy shit.  Dude, she's a yoga instructor.  Oh, man.  Or Pilates.  Like, her body is just slimming over the weekend.  God, yeah.  I think so, yeah.  She is phenomenally attractive.  Why would he get married? 
[00:32:30]  I guarantee you there's a big prenup, of course.  I'm an idiot.  Prenup pre-shmup.  They always try, and you end up in court anyway.  Yeah, he might have an ironclad prenup.  I love him.  He's hilarious.  He's a cranky.  He's a crankpot.  He's a crankpot.  He's known to be a crankpot.  But I love the fact that he's going after these sleazy fucking photographers.  They don't need...  Him getting married is not news.  Right.  It's not who gives a shit.  No.  So they're not getting news.  They're just fucking bothering him. 
[00:33:00]  Yeah.  She's a looker, all right.  Oh, dude.  She is depressing.  That's a wowee.  He is calling out the press on that, just at every turn now.  It doesn't matter.  He'll fucking go after the paparazzi now.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, the mamarazzi, too.  Ah!  Ooh.  Do you know what I said, Sam?  I heard it.  Is he still fighting with Kim Basinger?  I imagine he is.  Yeah.  That's one of the classic ones.  They've been fighting for decades at this point.  Yeah.  Classic shit. 
[00:33:30]  They call him the still-seething star, snarled at a daily...  Still-seething star.  Still-seething star.  He's still seething.  You know how mad you are to be seething still?  You've got to be mad if you're seething.  I used to see him in the neighborhood a lot, Jimmy, because he used to go somewhere.  You know, he used to go to a...  Go somewhere.  He used to, like, go somewhere.  Oh, really?  And he's so not approachable when he walks around New York. 
[00:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  There were no photographers around.  No one really knew.  He was up on the Upper West Side for a while there.  And he's not approachable.  And he actually walks in traffic.  I think that's what people don't bother him, right?  He walks in traffic.  It's the first celebrity I've seen in New York.  That's their move.  Why?  They walk in traffic because it's harder to say hi to him.  Oh, okay.  So he'll walk pretty much, not just on the side, like, he's almost in a lane.  And I guess that's his way of making sure no one's going to stop him and ask for an autograph or a picture or what have you. 
[00:34:30]  I've only seen him once, and that was when we were at the McCartney.  I think that, no, Springsteen or McCartney.  I don't remember.  And I said hi to him real quick.  He said hello back, but it was just a courtesy.  I didn't get a picture, I think, because I was worried about the stones.  Yeah.  Kidney?  All right, dummies.  I don't...  I didn't want to...  That was a good one.  Kidney stones. 
[00:35:00]  Why would I be worried about...  Why?  But why wouldn't I take a picture with Alec Baldwin because there's kidney stones around?  Well, because if you had kidney stones, you'd be in pain, and you're just thinking about those.  Fair enough.  Or if he had them, you know, you wouldn't want to...  Worrying about your next piss or something.  Right?  Knowing it's coming.  That would prevent you from getting pictures with the Rolling Stones.  Uh...  Uh...  Reverend Al didn't mention the black people blocking white people from voting.  They didn't block anyone from voting.  No.  They were just there...  It was a bit intimidating. 
[00:35:30]  They were just there to intimidate people.  They were certainly intimidating white people.  Holding weaponry in front of a voting place and saying that it's fine.  Right.  Exactly.  Right.  Yeah.  Right.  Why don't we, you know, do that?  Because they were there protecting black people's right to vote.  Really?  The Black Panthers with fucking the billy clubs?  Nice.  What do you make of this Tom Cruise thing?  Uh...  Well...  It's one of those very obvious things that we...  I think we all knew was going to happen eventually.  Sure.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  A lot of people are figuring out that, you know, a lot of people thought that there was 
[00:36:00]  some weird five-year contract that was signed.  Uh-huh.  And I guess this is all coming down as that five years is up.  Yeah, yeah.  So people are saying, well, I guess the contract was up.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Scientology, um, there are so many rumors about what happens inside, uh, the walls of, uh,  Scientology.  Yeah.  And, uh, some people believe that it's some kind of a organization for, what, Hollywood's 
[00:36:30]  gay elite?  That they, uh, that they would go in and they would protect them and their image in Hollywood.  Uh, and then I guess they get a shitload of money in return is, uh, what the, the rumor  is.  And, uh, she is part of this, she would be part of this scheme to make him look like a  heterosexual guy that's married.  And, uh, now she's very worried about Scientology snatching the kid. 
[00:37:00]  And she is right.  She's, uh, held up here in New York city and there's cars parked in front of her, uh, apartment  taking pictures of people that are going in and out, asking questions.  Who's that?  And, uh, it's being speculated that they are Scientology people.  Keep an eye on it.  It's not the paparazzi?  Cause now that it's a big story, they're going to follow her?  No, it's just got two guys in a fucking white SUV.  Yeah, I saw the picture and they look kind of creepy.  Yeah.  It wouldn't surprise me if they were just paparazzi though, but Scientology's just gotten creepy  at this point.  It's very creepy.  Stalking.  If it's true.  I mean, I, maybe it might be bullshit, but if it's true, it's like, what are you doing? 
[00:37:30]  Yeah.  Very creepy.  By the way, that five-year contract thing, which I've heard over the weekend a lot.  I mean, Suri's six years old, so they've been together more than five years.  Yeah.  Oh.  So I don't, you know, I don't, I don't know.  And, and what, the final straw, um, Katie Holmes was worried about Suri and, and Scientology.  And Scientology.  Making decisions or whatever for her daughter.  That's what she's kind of saying to her friends.  She just looked like a zombie the whole marriage, didn't she?  Yeah.  She just looked like, hi. 
[00:38:00]  She's supposed to be in the dark night, but she didn't because she was pregnant.  Yeah.  And we all know Tom Cruise is just a weirdo.  Yeah, he's a weirdo.  He's a fucking weirdo.  There's rumors about him, right?  Jumping on the couch like that with Oprah, looked like a weirdo.  He's just a strange guy.  Interviews, he's just weird.  He's not the guy you see in movies.  He just laughs a lot.  He just, uh, now you're just, you're being glib.  You think that's what it is?  Glib.  Yeah, he's a strange dude.  He's a weird guy.  Comes across very strange.  But then you see him, and it's like, alright, you know, he's had this immense career his 
[00:38:30]  entire life.  You fucking look at people he co-starred in movies with, and he looks amazing compared  to them.  I don't know what they're doing in there.  He looks 30.  Yeah, he's ripped.  He fucking looks good.  You look at fucking, you know.  He's probably 50 years old.  Yeah.  Easily, dude.  He's still doing Mission Impossible.  He's still a great action star.  But the guy's fucking awesome.  He really is awesome.  And you, yeah.  He's like, what the fuck?  And then you look at people that he acted with years ago, and they're a disaster. 
[00:39:00]  What's that, Sam?  That's Tom Cruise.  What year, though?  That's this year.  That's fucking this year?  Yeah, that's from Rock of Ages.  What the fuck?  He's ripped.  Motherfucker, right?  The final straw on the Kitty Holmes decision to file for divorce was that she was convinced  Tom Cruise was going to send six-year-old Suri away to a hardcore Scientology organization  known as Sea Organization.  What's that about?  Sea Org.  As it is known, is where the highest levels of Scientology are taught, and kids as young 
[00:39:30]  as five can be sent to live there without their parents, and our sources say Tom is  a big fan of this.  That sounds like a cult to me.  So Katie didn't want to lose her daughter.  No.  To Sea Org?  Can you look up Sea Org?  What do you got on that, Sam?  Sea Org has been compared to a boot camp, and several ex-Scientologists, including Oscar  winner Paul Haggis, has been outspoken against its military-like conditions.  Military-like conditions.  Oh.  The free winds, the massive Scientology boat that was the location of Cruise's infamous 
[00:40:00]  birthday party in 2004, is entirely staffed by Sea Org members.  Wow, that seems pretty creepy.  They got their own fucking navy.  Holy shit.  Members of Sea Org signed a one-billion-year pledge to symbolize their eternal commitment to  the religion, and it is still signed by all members today.  How do you get out of a billion-year contract?  About a hundred.  What are you doing?  A billion-year contract.  That's so silly.  That really is crazy.  Imagine your billion years are up, and you really are, there really is something after 
[00:40:30]  life.  Yeah, like, what happens?  Oh, man.  Hey, can I sign another contract?  Yeah.  Or now do I got to float in infamy and have nothing?  I'm going to just stay here.  Wow.  Or is it something that's just...  That was a dumb word there.  Is it just like Catholic school?  Huh?  Is it just like Catholic school or something?  Well, you know what?  Yeah, you could say that.  Scientology gets a bad rap because it's too new.  Like, some guy read some science fiction or wrote some science fiction, L. Ron Hubbard, 
[00:41:00]  and decided, you know, this is the religion, and it's real goofy and wacky.  But, you know, you add a couple thousand years, and it'll probably fly.  How crazy would it be, right?  Yeah.  I mean, look at the Mormons.  They're doing okay.  Yeah.  And their beliefs are a little strange as well.  Pretty fucking wacky, I'm just going to be honest.  All religions have strange beliefs.  Catholic religions are so fucking weird.  But the newer religions, you stare at like, wow, that's really weird.  But you're right.  Enough years go by, it doesn't get...  It's not as weird.  Joining the Sea Org. 
[00:41:30]  Oh, she looks like a fucking trip.  How old is this?  Can we hear this?  This is joining the Sea Org.  Who's that woman?  Part one.  Joining the Sea Org.  Who's that lady?  That's the journalist, right?  Is it?  Oh, I thought it was.  Get a good look at her.  Okay.  You know, like, I was just kind of pushed along into it.  I mean, generally speaking.  They told me that the only reason I was not joining was my reactive mind.  Oh.  Which was controlling me and telling me not to do it because your reactive mind stops you  from doing good things and this was a good thing. 
[00:42:00]  And I couldn't confront and take the responsibility to do it because of my reactive mind.  Wow.  So I should be bigger than my reactive mind and go and do it.  So then I was like, oh, yeah.  I don't want my reactive mind to control me.  She's cute.  So I better do it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They use virtually any tactic from yelling to they'll show you, like, newspaper clippings  of horrible things that have happened in the news and say, like, we try to stop this  and ever since we've been working on this area, you know, the crime has gone down and we have 
[00:42:30]  all these families and you think, oh, God, you know, I'd be such a horrible person if  I didn't go in here and help them out in this and I would just be irresponsible and  not doing my duty towards all of mankind.  That's exactly what it is.  That sort of thing.  And they also show you this policy that L. Ron Hubbard wrote saying, and it was written  in 1970, and it said in 30 years the planet won't support human life.  And then they told us the only reason it still is supporting human life, because this was  in, I don't know, 93, so we had seven years to go, but the only reason it's made any improvement 
[00:43:00]  is because of Scientology.  Oh.  And if we don't keep going, the planet isn't even able to support life.  That was 93?  Thank you.  So you have half of me going, like, I can't let my reactive mind control me, and half of  me going, I have to help mankind.  And then part of me was going to allow...  When does the fucking come in?  This sounds like one of those cults where the kid guy's got to fuck all the girls.  Isn't it amazing how old this footage looks?  It's from 93?  I think this, I don't even, I think it's newer than 93.  She was talking about...  She said it's 93, so we still have seven years to go. 
[00:43:30]  No, she said that, he said in 30 years, in 1970, that the Earth wouldn't be able to  support life, and that would be the year 2000.  Right.  But she said that they started making excuses for it in 93, why the Earth was still...  Go back a little bit.  She was on the boat in 93.  Yeah, yeah.  Go back a little bit, Sam.  Stop siding with Anthony.  Sam, oh boy.  Fucking creep.  But the only reason it's made a new improvement...  No, further.  Further back, you fucking bag of shit.  ...is because in 30 years the planet won't support exactly what it is.  That sort of thing.  And they also show you this policy that L. Ron Hubbard wrote, saying, and it was written 
[00:44:00]  in 1970, and it said in 30 years the planet won't support human life.  And then they told us the only reason it still is supporting human life, because this was  in, I don't know, 93, so we had seven years to go.  Yes!  But the only reason it's made any improvement is because of Scientology, and if we don't  keep going, the planet isn't even going to be able to support life.  So you have half of me going, like, I can't let my reactive mind control me, and half of  me going, I have to help mankind. 
[00:44:30]  And then part of me was going, oh, wow, I'm going to get paid money, and I don't have to  wear a uniform, and it's going to be so fun, and these guys are going to work with them,  and I get to work with them.  I want to be on Sea Orc.  So the next day I started, and I started what's called the Estates Project Force, which is  Boot Camp.  Oh, good.  And my schedule was something like, get up at 6.30, breakfast at 7.  Did I do that?  7.30, we had, like, a muster, like a staff meeting thing.  Mustard?  You know, drill.  Yeah, I'm a creep!  I'm a wedding! 
[00:45:00]  You don't like that?  I had to run around into trash cans.  I don't like that.  It's nice.  You don't like anything nice.  I don't.  Everything has to be harsh with you.  Exactly.  Everything's terrible.  So what's the...  So that's boring, whatever the fuck that is.  Sea Orc.  You may qualify, see a Sea Orc recruit.  I want to go to Sea Orc.  Sea Orc.  I like that.  Let's go to Sea Orc.  Got a navy.  It's a fucking Scientology navy.  But what do they teach you at Sea Orc?  What's the difference on the sea than on the land? 
[00:45:30]  I don't get it.  What does the boot camp do?  Yeah, she went.  This guy was a member of Sea Orc.  Do you want to go to it or not?  I bet he wasn't.  I bet he's got a bad joke about it.  Yeah, you think?  Probably.  Mark and Phil...  Well, coming out of Philly, sure.  Mark, what's up, buddy?  No joke at all, man.  We, uh...  Tasty rage.  No joke at all, but...  Hey, bud.  Let's party.  I was part of Sea Orc. 
[00:46:00]  Nah, it's dead serious.  I was actually a member there.  When I was younger, my parents forced me into it.  It's based out of Clearwater, Florida.  Basically, the whole town is taken over by a Scientologist.  Oh.  All right.  And what happened?  There was actually an agenda back in the 70s by L. Ron Hubbard to totally take over,  like, an American city.  Mm-hmm.  Totally take over the government.  He pretty much accomplished it.  But Sea Orc's kind of like a religious, militant wing of Scientology. 
[00:46:30]  Oh.  And what, were your parents, Scientologists, and forced you into that thing?  Yeah.  Wow.  What's the difference between Sea Orc?  Like, what do they do that is more hardcore?  Uh, it's just more militaristic, and it's just really, I mean, they basically give you  $24, like, a week to live on.  You pretty much work 14-hour days.  Uh, you're either stationed out in California or in Florida, but it's pretty intense, pretty  abusive.  What, do you swab the deck?  Uh, not, I mean, people used to do that back in the 70s and 80s, but now it's mostly land-based. 
[00:47:00]  Oh, okay.  So, uh, Tom Cruise loves these guys?  Yeah.  Yeah, he's a big supporter.  Uh, it's run by David Miscavige.  Miscavige, he's the, uh, the head of Scientology.  Do they drill with weapons or anything?  No, no, no.  They don't trust us, but, uh, David is a big weapons guy.  You, you probably like him, yeah.  Probably would.  But, uh, it's pretty, pretty crazy.  Is he married, David Miscavige? 
[00:47:30]  Yeah, but his wife, uh, disappeared in 2006.  What do you mean, disappeared?  Just that.  She disappeared.  That's creepy shit.  Oh, man.  And wait.  I'm out of this discussion.  Fuck this.  No one knows where she is?  Fuck this.  Nobody knew.  How about now?  Have they found her?  Well, what was...  What were the rumors that was going...  What's the story?  I never heard this.  Yeah, what were the rumors about their marriage that all of a sudden she disappeared?  Sam, try to find some news on that.  Uh, well, David's actually from Philadelphia also, but, I mean, it's... 
[00:48:00]  He was Tom Cruise's best man, and there's rumors that, you know, he's a homosexual, but...  Homosexual.  Homosexual.  Homosexual.  Wow.  Wow, what happened to that guy?  Uh, pretty...  He's a multi, multi, multi...  That's amazing.  He's a multi, multi, multi-millionaire who has no wife anymore.  Yeah.  Who just disappeared.  Sam is on the Wikipedia page.  That's kind of creepy.  This is the tricorder of our day and age. 
[00:48:30]  The Wikipedia.  When you need info on something.  All right.  Now, caller, shut up and let Sam talk.  Thank you.  Who, according to Lawrence Wright in The New Yorker, disappeared in 2006, and her current  status is unknown.  Wow.  What?  Wow.  That's weird.  What are the circumstances of her disappearance?  Uh, I don't know.  Her disappearance occurred after she filled several job... 
[00:49:00]  Vacancies.  Vacancies.  Vaccines.  Vacancies without her husband's permission.  Yeah, well, and she deserved whatever she got.  Uh, his older brother was an executive in Sea Org, but left the church in 2000.  His sister was hired by a Scientology donor as a top executive for a Florida-based company,  uh, where she was linked to an accounting scheme.  That sounds pretty fucking, uh...  Oh, my God.  Mysterious.  Mysterious.  So you think that, uh, the wife may have been taken care of by somebody? 
[00:49:30]  What did the authorities do with this?  Did they question the guy?  I would hope so.  That's weird.  You would think, like...  Wow.  Well...  You would think, uh, Scientology...  Mm-hmm.  I don't know.  That's...  I'm gonna do some research on that one.  Yeah, because...  That sounds interesting.  If there's...  I'm not.  If there's rumors...  I'm all for the Scientologists out there.  I love them.  If there's rumors...  Keep up your good nature.  If there's rumors about the guys...  Fuck that!  Do you think his wife was ready to come out and say some things, maybe? 
[00:50:00]  Maybe.  I don't know.  I'm sure you could speculate till what they say the cows come home.  Have fun with that research.  I was thinking of an Iraq joke.  Him coming home.  Pressing the doorbell with his oof.  Yeah.  His little oof.  Oh, no, he wouldn't.  He would just shake his head back and forth and his bellowed, generally, good-naturedly.  Get it, Iraq?  Yeah.  All right, Marky.  Thank you, sir.  Thanks, Mark.  Unless you have anything else to add.  I don't know.  Yeah, it's interesting, dude.  Yeah, Anthony, could I borrow some money, bud? 
[00:50:30]  No.  No?  No.  Unless you're a chick.  How old is David Miscavich?  He's...  1960.  He was a year older than me.  Getting back to Tom Cruise, I wonder if this is true.  Wilford Brimley.  We remember Wilford Brimley, right?  Yeah, diabetes.  Supposedly, he was 50 when he made Cocoon.  Wow.  Tom Cruise is going to be 50 soon.  Come on.  Can we put the two together?  The picture you just had of Tom Cruise at 50?  Close enough, anyway.  Come on.  That's hilarious. 
[00:51:00]  We've got to make sure that Wilford Brimley was 50 when he filmed Cocoon.  Or Big Red Shark is an asshole on Twitter.  34, 54, 64, 84, 33, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80.  Yeah, he's 50.  Wilford Brimley is 51.  All right, so close enough.  Holy shit, come on.  Give me a 50-year-old Wilford Brimley next to a 50-year-old Tom Cruise.  I'll pop that up.  There you go.  Is that Cocoon 2? 
[00:51:30]  There's not much makeup being used there either.  It might be from Cocoon 2.  Oh, really?  Yeah.  How would you know the difference?  Well, it was a couple years later.  Would it just be Cocoon?  That's Cocoon.  That can't be 50.  Come on.  Come on.  It might be.  I don't know.  A lot.  Is this Cocoon?  It's probably Cocoon, right?  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  That's him.  Perfect.  That's definitely a 50-year-old Wilford Brimley.  Yeah, yeah.  With his shirt off, so there's no Hollywood makeup being used there.  That's good. 
[00:52:00]  You got him at 50.  Yeah.  And let's put him next to Tom Cruise.  Let's see if there's something to the Scientology.  There might be.  They might have some good shit.  They might have.  Within their walls.  Okay.  And there's Tom Cruise with his shirt off.  Look at this.  That's both 50.  That's two 50-year-old men.  Wow.  Holy shit.  Get the fuck out of here.  Genetics.  Scientology.  They might have found some good shit.  They fucking figured it out. 
[00:52:30]  Maybe they found some good shit.  They got like a Fountain of Youth thing.  You know they're working on it.  The Fountain of Youth thingy.  They probably are working on some type of machine or chemicals or something that keeps you young.  And they must be using it on him.  Wow.  All right.  They got that wacky shit going on.  Why don't we take a break?  Eat.  We got Dennis Leary coming in today.  Oh.  Got a huge part in The Amazing Spider-Man, which is in theaters tomorrow.  Oh, they're starting the holiday week early, huh? 
[00:53:00]  The Amazing Spider-Man.  Leary was great in this movie.  Mm-hmm.  He was really good.  How was the movie?  It was good.  I liked it.  I definitely liked it.  Was, um, what's his name?  Was it a good Spider-Man?  Yeah, I thought so.  The graphics are good and all that stuff?  Like, you know, CGI?  Yeah, the CGI was great.  I mean, they went with the love story a little too long for my taste.  But I think they were trying to get that Twilight audience.  Hey, I heard that-  A young, you know, couple in love.  Tweens.  I heard that his web that he makes isn't part of his biology. 
[00:53:30]  No.  Yeah, he made it.  What the fuck is that about?  He had a little fucking thing on his wrist.  Dude, what is that?  Did he even get bit by a spider?  Yeah, he got bit by the spider.  What does the spider do?  But now, isn't Spider-Man supposed to have a fucking little spider hole in his fucking spider wrist?  Yeah, it's supposed to be part of him.  But when he was in that area where he got bit with the spider, he took- they were developing  these little cartridges and using that web to replace, like, steel cables and things around  the world.  Uh-huh.  And these little webs were in these cartridges.  So he took all those cartridges, made a little contraption, and then he shoots it out of his- 
[00:54:00]  these contraptions off his wrist.  How does it stick to the wall, though?  It's just naturally sticky.  Everything sticks right to it.  He doesn't have a little hole in his wrist?  No.  But how does it, when he grabs it to swing- does when he swings his wrist just hang out  stupidly?  Or does he hold on to the web?  He holds on.  How come it doesn't get all over his gloves?  What if he runs out of little canisters?  Yeah, that I was trying to figure out, because at certain times you see him putting the cartridges  in.  Oh, what if he's mid-fucking-flying around the buildings and shit and it runs out? 
[00:54:30]  Well, he's gonna take enough cartridges, depending on how much fucking whipping around he's  gonna do.  Well, I don't believe that's true to Spider-Man.  Here comes Danny.  Danny will help us out here.  I don't believe that's true to Spider-Man.  I just watched the movie.  I didn't even-  He just- he took an old watch and made some contraption.  Give me the watch.  Put the little cartridge in it and that would use it.  Put the watch up his ass.  Yeah, but the webs he made in the sewer system, there's no way he had enough cartridges to make 
[00:55:00]  that happen.  What's going on?  When you see the movie, you'll understand what I'm saying.  The cartridge- the web juice that he- in the cartridge-  Web juice!  Web juice!  That's part of the original Spider-Man story.  Is it?  Yeah, when you read the original comic books, he never had webbing that actually came out  of his wrist.  He always had some kind of device that was rigged with webbing.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,  and sometimes he would run out of webbing.  All right, hold on.  Who changed the story then?  Because they're going old school with this, obviously.  Who decided that it's something that comes actually out of his body? 
[00:55:30]  It was actually the 2001 or 2, whatever year that was, it was that movie that changed  it to where it was actually biological.  What?  I thought he always had it when I-  Yeah, growing up I always thought it was coming out of his wrist.  Well, yeah, it looks like that because the way the device is built into the costume, that's  why his fingers are always depressed into his palm.  Yeah.  That's actually the trigger mechanism for the web.  I did not know this.  I did not know this.  Oh, so it's the original.  So they're going old school.  I wasted a lot of time as a teenager. 
[00:56:00]  All right, that makes sense.  Yeah, growing up I just assumed it came out of his body, but I did not know this, sir.  Yeah, that's the original story.  Well, it's kind of dumb because there's no way he would be able to carry enough cartridges  to get something.  Yeah, I mean, especially in a spandex suit where he keeps wearing muscles in his palm.  And wouldn't a fucking, and why would it even, if it is biological during those movies,  why his wrist and not out of his ass like a spider?  Like he should just be able to bend it over and shitting web out of his ass into buildings  swinging around. 
[00:56:30]  Full mooning his webs all over the place.  Swinging around on a web out of his ass.  Yeah.  Fucking cutting him off.  But Dennis Leary is the father of Emma Stone's character in The Amazing Spider-Man.  Well.  Did you see the movie yet, Danny?  No, no, no, not yet.  Love to know what you thought.  Yeah, I would definitely check it out.  Yeah.  I got a lot of stuff on my plate.  All right.  So Leary will be here at 8 o'clock.  And that's good news.  Kiss My Ass, the new single slash video available today on Funny or Die. 
[00:57:00]  Leary's doing a video for Funny or Die, so check that out today.  Let's look at it for a second.  What is Kiss My Ass?  How about we do it after the break because I'm going to pee myself.  Okay, let's do it after.  Please.  Thank you.  Diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes, diabetes,  diabetes, diabetes, testing supplies.  Sirius XM.  You're listening to O.P. and Anthony.  Whether or not you're paying attention is another question.  Welcome to the jungle. 
[00:57:30]  We got fun and games.  We got everything you want.  How do we know the names?  We are the people that can find whatever you may need.  If you've got the money, honey, we got your disease.  Welcome to the jungle.  Good morning, E-Rock.  Good morning.  How was your weekend?  Very good.  I asked you in the hall, what did you do over the weekend? 
[00:58:00]  Went to a concert on Friday night.  What concert?  Because I think it's the band that Ann hates.  I went to see...  Or is it Jimmy?  Or is it both of you guys?  I don't know who hates it.  I know you like the song.  I went to see LMFAO.  The fun party band.  You know what?  I want to hate them, but some of their stuff is fucking enjoyable.  Very catchy, right?  They are good.  They're the I'm Sexy and I Know It guys. 
[00:58:30]  If I had a party, I would want these guys there.  Fuck yeah.  What kind of crowd do they get?  A little different than the ONA crowd.  Very, very young girls.  There's 12-year-old girls with their mom and dad.  And they're singing Face Down, Ass Up.  Oh, yeah, how about that?  And that song Shots.  Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.  We need to drink them to suck our cocks.  Yeah, 12-year-old girls are just singing it throughout the whole arena. 
[00:59:00]  Wait, they do Shots as well?  Yep.  Holy fuck.  How many party hits do they have at this point?  They play the Lil Jon part on screen while the song's going on.  So his vocals come in and then they come in live with theirs.  What song is that?  You know Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots.  Oh, Ron Jeremy's in this video.  It's got 240 million views.  That's all?  Wow.  Give them Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots.  Did you just mix that shit? 
[00:59:30]  Oh, and he's doing the dick fucking.  Turn that up.  Blank.  Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots, Shots.  This is a huge hit, too.  Yeah, these guys are enjoyable.  I can't say they're not.  And what else do they do?  Give me another one.  They do...  This is like fucking drop some ecstasy rave kind of music.  Yeah, it's just good club music.  I mean, it is good.  It's catchy as all of them.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  I know this one, too.  Whoever the DJ is of these guys is fucking amazing. 
[01:00:00]  How many of them are there?  Three of them?  There's two guys, and then they have a whole cast around them.  They have four hits out right now.  Yeah.  What's the other hit?  This one has a half a billion views.  Oh, my God.  Jesus Christ.  Which one is this?  456 million.  How do you get 456 million views? 
[01:00:30]  Oh, my God.  It's unbelievable.  That's the clue that I'm wepping on the rise to the top.  No, let it are Zeppelin.  Hey!  Oh, my God, these guys.  And what's the fourth?  I know.  What are they called?  LMFO?  So, Faggot, what were you doing there? 
[01:01:00]  Um, oh, oh, Jimmy.  What?  I was there with my wife, and we took her nephew and his girlfriend.  What do they do in between the four songs everyone knows?  They do a whole bunch of other songs that all these little girls seem to know.  And their finale.  Yeah.  I think the song's called Champagne Dollars.  Yeah.  And for two minutes, they just open up cases of champagne and soak all the girls in the front row.  Nice.  And then the little kids getting soaked.  Did they give a good show?  Oh, yeah.  I was amazed. 
[01:01:30]  Iraq, did you want to go?  Yes and no.  I did want to go, but I was just like, it seemed a little too young, but I had a great time there.  Well, he wanted to go because he thought it was lounging my fat ass off.  Oh, shit.  Oh, wow.  Where was the show?  At the Prudential Center.  Was it crowded?  Yeah.  It was packed.  See, I just thought, like, who came up with the idea to go?  Was it your wife?  She bought the tickets for her nephew's birthday. 
[01:02:00]  Oh, okay.  And why did you have to go, though?  She said, do you want to go?  And I said, yeah, I'll go.  Oh.  I'd go to this.  You wouldn't go to this?  I just assumed maybe if there was a barbecue or something, that you would be able to keep  her from going to something she wanted to go to, much like you would have kept from going  to wrestling.  See, but.  Wait, what happened?  What do you got, man?  I'm confused.  Oh, he wasn't able to go to wrestling.  Oh, I think I know a girl in this video.  He had to go to a barbecue.  A couple weeks ago.  Oh.  Yeah, he wasn't able to go to wrestling.  Yeah, because of Father's Day. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, yeah, I know a girl.  Because he had to go to a party.  Barbecue that was put together.  What the hell is this?  Is this their latest hit?  I don't know this one.  No, this is one of them.  This is the only one I don't know.  This is wacky.  You want to go back to something you know?  They sure like to party.  They're all about the partay.  Ah, Iraq, turn this shit off.  Why the Welcome to the Jungle? 
[01:03:00]  In 1991, on this date, Axl Rose jumped off stage and beat up a fan for taping the concert  and started a whole riot in St. Louis.  Wow.  That's 20 years ago already.  21, right?  Holy shit.  And before that, Jimmy Stewart died today.  Oh.  Oh.  I have to point out that I was really wrong about Tiger Woods.  I said he was done.  He's the FedEx point leader.  He has won three tournaments this year, which I think is the most by anyone on the PGA Tour. 
[01:03:30]  Yeah.  He's so back, and I was so fucking wrong.  Everyone said he was done.  I said, ah, he's going to win a couple tournaments here and there, but he's pretty much over.  He's actually getting better as the weeks go by, too.  So wrong.  He won over the weekend.  Did you see, I know you're not a golf guy, but did you see what happened on Saturday?  It's worth mentioning.  No.  They had a massive storm come through, and it fucked up the whole golf course, trees down  all over the place, and other tree limbs just kind of hanging there, and they weren't sure 
[01:04:00]  if they were going to fall.  I'll dry it off there, Sandy.  So the PGA decided, we can't have spectators.  So they played the third round of this tournament basically with no one on the golf course.  Oh, really?  Just kind of fucking old school.  Well, what happened was some of the members of that actual course came.  But besides that, no one else was allowed.  They held people back.  And I guess even just getting to the golf course for the guys playing in the tournament was a nightmare.  There were trees down all over the place, so they had all these detours just to get to the course. 
[01:04:30]  So these guys are like, you know, they're sinking birdie pots and having nice shots and then  just waving to, you know, they were having a good time with it, just waving to no one.  No.  In some cases, waving to nobody.  To no one?  Just having a fucking blast.  You've got to give the little, yeah.  And then yesterday, the crowd was allowed back, and Tiger won the tournament.  But it was really strange.  It's worth checking out some of that footage, because when was the last time you saw a PGA  event with nobody on there? 
[01:05:00]  For the most part, nobody on the course.  Can't be chilling up the course.  Tiger won again, man.  I was way off on that one.  Good for Tiger.  Good for him.  Oh, Dennis Leary coming in at 8 o'clock.  Oh.  He's got a Funny or Die video that premieres today, right?  Oh, yeah.  It's up there right now.  It's called Kiss My Ass, and the S's are dollar signs.  Oh, let's see that.  Let me see it.  What's this about, Sam, before you play it?  Well, it's his new song.  He's putting out the video on the single today.  On Funny or Die.  He doesn't have enough going on. 
[01:05:30]  He's one of the stars of the new Spider-Man movie.  He's got Ice Age 8 or something coming out this week?  Four.  Ice Age 4, Continental something, Continental Drift.  It comes out on the 13th of July.  Wow.  There are up to four Ice Ages already?  They're all hits.  Like money makers.  You think he makes money off that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, my God.  Between that, Spider-Man, and those truck commercials, I think Dennis Leary's doing very well.  Oh, yeah.  Those are good movies, those Ice Age.  How much money do you make to do a commercial like the truck commercial?  I have no idea what a guy on his level gets. 
[01:06:00]  That would be $15, $20.  Nice.  Hit it, Sam.  Here's Kiss My Ass with Dennis Leary from Funny or Die.  All right.  Oh, there's Trump as a Kardashian.  Kiss my ass, cause I'm American.  Don't care if gas hits 11 bucks or more. 
[01:06:30]  I'd love it as you'd be that good fit 14 of me.  I kiss my ass, kiss my ass, kiss my ass.  Now this crazy world, it's a ticket time bomb.  Any day, any day, could be the last.  I recognize those guys.  I stand that I gotta sit on my new 3D TV.  I kiss my ass, kiss my big fat lazy ass. 
[01:07:00]  Kiss my ass.  Tornadoes almost wiped out Alabama.  All right.  Okay.  Nucleus tsunami in Japan.  I wonder if we're heading for some kind of bomb again.  Cause I want to watch it on the smartphone in my hand.  And kiss my balls, kiss my balls.  Cause I don't give a shit. 
[01:07:30]  How about war?  How about war?  Or poverty.  So, isn't this great?  How about the fucking mess?  And I could not care less.  Cause I'll be on my sofa playing a wee.  Holy shit.  Kiss my ass.  O-M-G.  Kiss my ass. 
[01:08:00]  Oh.  Voluntary.  Ha, ha, ha.  Voting.  Well, actually, voting is a really, really important part of the democratic process.  Because if you don't get out there and vote, you know what happens?  You don't find out who the winner is on American Idol.  So, kiss my ass.  Kiss it.  Go ahead and fuck her up.  Go fuck her up.  Kiss my ass.  It's like the Blarney Stone.  I know it smells like crap. 
[01:08:30]  And there's no app for that.  Kiss my ass.  It's a blow.  Kiss it slow.  Kiss it bad.  Kiss my skinny.  Irish.  Be more funny. 
[01:09:00]  Well, no shit.  So to speak, literally.  What's that supposed to be?  Some kind of sick joke?  Bamberg. 
[01:09:30]  Keep fucking that chicken.  What have we got here?  Fucking comedian. 
[01:10:00]  It's a person.  There's a person stranded.  There's a person stranded.  I see the awful, terrible things in my life  and turn it into something funny.  Clued.  Become a square-shaped clued.  Yeah.  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  That's terrific.  That's terrific.  This is going great. 
[01:10:30]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha ha.  Ah, did you see that jerk?  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.  Ah, that's funny.  I'm funny.  I was only joking.  All right. 
[01:11:00]  Asshole!  Okay, faggot!  What's next?  Pardon my French,  but you're an asshole.  Dennis Lurie's going to be on the program 
[01:11:30]  in about 15 minutes.  Yes!  He's on his way up.  Is he doing our show first?  Yep.  Why, you got tears in your eyes?  You all right, Sam?  He's on his way up already?  Yeah, my hamster died, so...  Aw.  I'm sorry to hear that.  No, it's cool.  I'm just emotional.  Kiss my ass.  Kiss my ass.  Kiss my...  It's very catchy.  It's the attitude we all should have.  Yeah.  It's fun, too.  Yeah, exactly.  It's like a...  It's fun and it's catchy.  Yep.  It's just like...  Oh, he's right there. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, there he is.  Hopefully, uh...  How long is the delay?  Ugh.  Should we go to a break?  Nah.  Is he taking pictures?  Or is he coming down the hall now?  He should probably just...  I don't know what he's doing.  He's kind of just, like,  hanging out over there.  Should we take a single?  I was chatting with Roland.  You want to take a single?  Well, I don't want him to come in  when we're not on the air.  We should probably take a single.  Why?  Just to clear the field.  Oh.  I don't want him to come in.  We just came back.  I think we should probably  chat him in.  I don't know what he's doing, though.  He's hanging out.  Well, tell them to bring him out. 
[01:12:30]  He's 100 feet down the hall.  He's standing there.  If he comes down here  when we're in break  and comes in  and sits down on break,  it's like...  Yeah.  You know.  Then you've got to do  that off-air talking.  Yeah.  I hate the off-air  small talk banter.  You don't like that?  I hate it.  Why?  That's more like real life shit.  I don't know.  How you been?  How's your summer going?  That's good.  Oh, I hate that stuff.  Saw Spider-Man.  Liked it a lot.  You know, stuff like that.  Save that for the air.  You'd rather save it for the air?  Oh, yeah.  Really?  Yeah. 
[01:13:00]  Kiss my ass.  Kiss my ass.  Kiss my ass.  Well, we're in a quandary.  He's still not walking down the hall.  What are you doing?  I don't know.  He's probably got things to do.  Maybe he's got to take a leak.  All right.  Then let's do a single.  Make sure he doesn't come in  during the break  and then we'll start all fresh  with Dennis Leary.  One of the big stars  of the Spider-Man movie.  How about we do that?  Okay?  All right.  Quick break, Iraq, please. 
[01:13:30]  Sirius XM.  Sirius XM.  Yeah.  This is the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Want to welcome Dennis Leary  to the radio show.  What's up, Dennis?  How are you?  Let's practice it.  De-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de-de.  I don't know.  I asked for Dennis Leary  but he's still kind of just  hanging out down the hall.  Looks like Roland  always holds people down back there.  I know he doesn't  but it looks that way  when you look down the hallway. 
[01:14:00]  What is it?  It's like, you know,  bringing a prize fighter to the ring?  Is that what we do around here?  It's like Axel.  No one's running the show today.  Not really, no.  Here comes Roland.  Here comes Dennis Leary.  Here comes some woman.  Another woman.  And another guy.  Is that the guy?  Oh.  That might be one of the guys from his band.  Yeah, that's one of his guys from his band. 
[01:14:30]  What?  Yeah, I recognize it.  That's the guy from his band.  Oh, is that who that is?  I know that guy from your band.  Oh, yeah.  That's the guy from your band.  Hey.  Sorry about the Celtics.  It was a good run, though.  How mad are you?  We're going to be fine.  Next year, we're going to be even better.  No, you're not.  You've got an old team.  What are you talking about?  I just walked down here with Chris from the holding pen.  Hello.  There's a guy who works for you who's on a computer.  He's on Amazon buying stuff as we're walking in here. 
[01:15:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah, so I'm paying attention to the show.  Oh, who was it?  Five monitors in the room.  He's just buying stuff.  What's he buying?  You know, it looked like he was looking at Under Armour t-shirts.  I should be a cop.  You really should.  What did he look like?  I didn't really look at him.  I got a glance at him.  Okay.  Again, I'm not Columbo.  I could be.  Your Celtics aren't going to be good next year.  You've got a very old team.  The Knicks are going to be better than the Celtics next year, so let's start right there. 
[01:15:30]  Fab Mello, the other kid.  No.  Yeah, we're old.  We just drafted two 15-year-olds.  Okay?  Yeah, we're old.  You're going to go with the youth movement?  Yeah, we're going with the youth movement.  And we've got Kevin Garnett coming back.  Yeah, well, he's...  Hey, now which version of the show is this?  Is this the version we can swear on?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, fuck.  Great.  We only have one version these days.  It's easier that way.  Oh, I like just the one version.  It's easier that way.  Okay, cool.  Can I start by saying you were amazing in Spider-Man, sir?  Big star.  I can't believe you guys saw it, right?  I saw it last week. 
[01:16:00]  Jim, I didn't see it.  I haven't seen it.  I'm not going to fucking see it either.  I was away.  They have screenings, but I wasn't hearing the screening.  I went last Wednesday or Thursday.  Was it 3D?  The 3D is even better when the Avatar 3D came out.  I shouldn't even say this shit because I'm in the movie, but I didn't see it until...  I didn't see the final thing until the L.A. premiere last week.  Right.  But I knew it from, you know, in front of my eyes when we were doing it.  But Garfield is...  Yeah.  ...fantastic, man.  As is Emma.  Right.  He's just a great Spider-Man. 
[01:16:30]  Emma is a dark movie.  I like that dark, moody Spider-Man.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  I thought the first one with...  What's his name there?  Toby?  Fucking Tobey Maguire.  Yes.  That was, like, pretty good.  Yep.  For the time, especially.  A lot of times, yeah.  Yeah.  But now, I didn't see it yet.  Oh, my God.  It's great.  But...  Because I didn't go to the screening.  Why didn't you go to the screening?  I didn't fucking go to the screening.  Why?  When was the screening?  It was last week.  All right.  Let me tell you why.  It was probably a really nice day.  Liar.  And I went out to Long Island to go on my pool.  No, he's not lying. 
[01:17:00]  He's telling you the truth.  You'd rather hang out at his pool than see your movie.  At your pool, firing guns into the water to see how deep bullets go.  Yeah, yeah.  They don't go very deep.  Even though you're almost 50.  They don't go very deep.  Almost.  You've tried that?  You've tried the bullets in the pool yet?  No, I saw it on Mythbusters.  Apparently, it doesn't go very deep.  Dennis, but...  What?  I just want to get back to the 3D thing, because on this show, we bitch about 3D, because they  have to shove it in your face.  I know.  But they don't do that with Spider-Man. 
[01:17:30]  Well, you know what I don't like is when they do the 3D, and they're still doing it,  because in the Avengers, they did some of it, where they throw shit at the screen.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like, you know what?  And it has nothing to do with the movie, really.  It's just like, oh, wow.  Look here, 3D shit.  You don't really need that.  I like it better when it's just 3D, but we're not going to throw tables and hammers.  Is the Avengers 3D, too?  I haven't been to a movie in a while.  In the Avengers, like, every person has a thing that they can throw at the camera in  3D.  Like, Thor throws his hammer.  Jeremy Renner is some guy that shoots arrows, and he shoots arrows into the...  You know, it's like, all right, guys, come on. 
[01:18:00]  Yeah, what the hell is it?  Do you have...  Are they showing this on the IMAX?  Yeah.  Is Spider-Man on the IMAX?  I'd like to see that.  The 3D feels like the screen is, like, 10 feet in front of you.  I would like to see that.  I like the 3D.  What kind of cameras do they use?  How is that set up like that?  3D cameras.  Oh, that's a wonderful question.  I don't want to get technical.  But it's 3D cameras.  Holy shit.  Polarize.  Do you have a guy snap at 30?  I'm not talking brand name.  You know what's weird?  How many lenses?  The cameras are small.  The cameras are really small.  They're like, you know, two of these water bottles. 
[01:18:30]  But there's a camera here, and then there's a camera pointing down at that camera.  And I don't know the technical wherewithal, but the rig is huge.  So if I'm talking to Jim and we're doing a close-up on me, the rig behind Jim's head is literally...  Really?  Giant?  It's got a mirror on it.  So when you're looking at Jim, you're seeing a reflection of yourself upside down.  It's really bizarre.  It's fucked up.  That's how they film it?  Yeah.  They'll get that shit smaller eventually. 
[01:19:00]  Eventually, sure.  Oh, yeah.  It's got to be distracting.  What's going on, guys?  How you doing?  They haven't mastered the 3D TV yet.  That's next.  They've got to get the 3D TV.  You know what I heard from a guy recently is that the newest 3D TVs are great.  But, of course, there's nothing to watch except if you get 3D movies.  Right, right, right.  So I'd love to watch like boxing, hockey, UFC, all that stuff in 3D.  It'd be great.  We've got a great UFC match this weekend.  Who is it?  Us.  Lenny Clark versus...  Yeah, everybody.  Got Anderson Silva. 
[01:19:30]  Yeah, right.  Oh, yeah.  Right.  That's going to be an amazing one.  But anyway.  Yeah, all those sports have got to be in 3D at some point.  Yeah, at some point, sports.  Let's go.  Let's go.  Start there, right?  Yeah, let's go.  How does it feel to be in the big blockbuster movie, Dennis Leary?  I'm tired.  You're tired?  A lot of press, right?  I've been flying all over the place.  I've got four days off now.  Then I've got to go back and do a second round.  Because I also have Ice Age coming out.  I know, next week.  Yeah.  A week from this Friday.  Ice Age 4.  Those movies tend to do a pretty good...  Which is why, by the way...  They break even. 
[01:20:00]  Yeah.  Exactly.  That's why Chris and I decided to release the song now.  Not only because it's a 4th of July feel, because it's about kind of being an American,  but just figuring all this publicity, just throw it out there now.  Yeah, yeah.  The Kiss My Ass song.  Kiss My Ass.  It's on anyone's lips.  It's on anyone's lips.  Yes, it is.  You guys played it yet?  We did.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  It seems a little unpatriotic there, Dennis.  And the language is a bit salty.  I think it's very patriotic.  I think it's making sport of Americans.  Really?  Yeah, we don't go for the salty talk. 
[01:20:30]  No need for that kind of language.  Oh, my goodness.  We are celebrating everything American in that song.  Yeah.  Everything.  Yeah.  You know, I can't...  It's very patriotic.  It really is.  It really is.  It's all the stuff we got.  Yeah.  Was it fun making that video?  Actually, it was.  It was.  Those guys are great, man.  The funnier guy guys.  I mean, they're unbelievable.  There's no one day like that.  Yeah.  Because, you know, they don't use big budgets.  So, a guy comes in.  This kid, Brian Resberg, he was great.  And, you know, I'm always concerned about time. 
[01:21:00]  Like, you know, let's do as much as we can in as little amount of time as we have.  The guy came in.  We shot the band performance in about six hours.  Drove uptown to a hotel.  And he put up green screens and shot the green screen thing.  And we were done in like 12 hours.  Yeah.  It's crazy.  That's great.  Oh, you actually made it specifically for them.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No, yeah.  We made it for them.  So, you're not in that wacky little room?  You were green screened?  We were green screened in, you know, the last time I did something for them was out in L.A.  at their little crazy Funny or Die comedy shed, which is like a green screened tool shed, basically. 
[01:21:30]  But this time we shot it in New York because most of the band lives here and timing wise it worked out.  But they're fast, man.  So, you weren't with the band in that video?  Yeah.  Oh, then what's the green screen for?  For the part where I'm sitting watching the 3D TV.  Oh, I got you.  Okay, yeah.  Are you all right today?  I am so good.  I mean, you just, you seem fucked up.  Dennis, it's fucking Monday.  I know it's Monday.  And the closer we get to Fourth of July, the more, uh... 
[01:22:00]  I mean, he's looking at me and he's like, so you weren't in the room with the band.  All right, look.  You weren't.  Now, wait a minute.  You said green screened all of Spider-Man.  Have you met Emma Stone?  Where are you now?  You said green screened.  Do you have a gun?  You want to shoot it into some water?  What the fuck is going on with you?  You said green screened.  I wanted to know if you were in there with the band.  Because you said, like, the band did their part in six hours.  So I was assuming the band did it.  When I say the band, I mean me, too.  I'm in the band.  I assumed the band did it. 
[01:22:30]  He's a singer of the band.  And then they green screened Mr. Important did it.  By the way.  Because he couldn't be with the fucking band.  Because he's always thinking time.  Can we talk about the horn section in my band?  Sure can.  Is that not the hottest?  The girls.  The horns were amazing.  It's the only all chick horn section.  The horny horns.  Really?  The horny horns.  The horny horns.  The horny horns.  Beautiful.  We could have called them that.  We could have.  It's pretty good.  Actually, I think there is a horny horn.  Anyways, they're fucking great, those girls, man.  Yeah.  And they can really play.  They play their porn perfectly.  Are they real?  Yeah, they're real.  Are they CGI?  They're real musicians.  I thought you were green screened and they were CGI. 
[01:23:00]  Would it matter to you?  No, not at all.  If the attractive horn plays in later.  They're playing, though.  That's great.  Yeah, they are.  They're fantastic, man.  If you ever see us live, those girls are unbelievable.  It's hard to get.  They're always on the road.  No, they're always working.  Oh, yeah.  So basically, let me just get this straight.  Basically, your life is like in here.  Yeah.  Jim's funny.  Okay?  He's basically running the show.  Every once in a while, you get involved.  I try, man.  But really, all the fucking time, you're thinking about pool, bullets, guns. 
[01:23:30]  Yeah.  Booze.  Booze.  Girls.  Tits.  Pussies.  Ass.  Tits and ass.  That's great.  Guns.  That's why you have this distant look in your eye.  Occasionally, I do just kind of.  I'll drift off.  Occasionally?  Well, as the week progresses, I get a little more into what I'm doing here.  But Monday.  Monday's a throwaway day.  Oh, please.  What am I doing?  I saw your movie.  See?  I did my homework.  I know.  I did my homework.  I know.  Emma Stone is fucking good to look at. 
[01:24:00]  Yeah, she's great.  She's lovely.  She's good.  Holy shit.  Hope you made a great observation about Emma Stone.  She's a great actress, too, man.  Yes.  And he's a great actor.  They're going to be around for a long time.  She's dating Spider-Man.  Oh, really?  The observation is simple, that Emma Stone's getting all of Lindsay Lohan's roles.  It should have been her.  Wow.  But Lindsay Lohan is all banged up.  They're the same age, though.  I know.  How's that possible?  It's hard to believe, right?  Man.  She fucked up her career, that Lindsay Lohan.  Yeah.  Not her.  Blame the parents.  Yeah.  It's a parent thing.  Come on, man. 
[01:24:30]  That's so easy to blame.  You know?  Yeah, it's not like they're hidden, secret parents.  Yeah, I know.  All the pieces of shit they are.  Right.  It's not like, I wonder what her dad's like.  Let's check the prison records.  Yeah, he is.  He's out right now.  Sally Field was good.  Yeah, she's great.  And it looks like she didn't get...  Can I tell you something?  Yeah, yeah.  Sally Field, you know, once we started doing the press for this thing, like the other night  in L.A., she was there, and I don't even know how old she is, but I said to somebody,  Reese, the bad guy, she was introduced and brought out on the stage, and we were standing backstage, 
[01:25:00]  and as she's walking on stage, I went, you know what?  I'd date her right now.  Oh, yeah?  She looks unbelievable.  Really?  Funny, smart.  Sally Field.  Is she nice?  Unbelievably nice.  Yeah.  And hot.  And no face work, really, right?  No.  Nothing.  Her neck's a little rough.  She's got to, like, push the neck back.  Well, if we're being honest here.  70 years old, that's not bad.  All right.  And you know what?  All five of us look fucking great.  My neck is still hanging in there, though.  Your neck is hanging in there? 
[01:25:30]  Hanging in there.  Really?  Yeah, it's hanging in there.  Okay, so let me ask you this.  I've been told that I look a lot younger than I am.  Jim.  Dennis Lear is very aggressive today.  How often do you look at your fucking neck in the morning to see how it looks?  Oh, man.  I'm obsessed with it, because it's the one part of me that I think is going to go first.  When I lotion, I use...  I can't fucking believe you guys look at your neck.  You've got to lotion up the neck there.  When I use lotion, I always lotion my neck as well, always, because I want my neck to  be young and youthful.  I want a youthful neck.  You think that works?  Nothing gets a pussy wetter than a youthful neck.  A youthful neck.  Dennis is protecting people, but I did say on the show that Sally Field is hot. 
[01:26:00]  Yeah.  I came in here the next day and said, holy fuck, Sally Field is hot.  But then you took a left turn into talking about your neck and how great your neck is.  I didn't say it was great.  I said it's hanging in there.  Can I ask you something?  I'm saying it's hanging in there.  Isn't your wife like 25 years younger than you?  No, not 25.  Okay.  How many?  18.  All right.  So...  What's wrong with that?  20 years younger than you.  Does she ever say, oh, honey, your neck looks so great.  When's the last time you're an 18-year-old younger wife?  Imagine your fucking neck.  You didn't notice the neck. 
[01:26:30]  I just...  Listen, guys.  You didn't notice the neck.  Listen.  The neck is what females worry about, not us.  Right.  I'm not worried about my neck.  I was worried about her neck.  I was worried about your fucking fastball.  I was worried about her neck.  You mentioned your neck.  I have a great neck, you said.  I worry about my neck a lot.  Jesus.  I don't...  Fucking guys.  I don't know.  Don't attack me.  I saw your movie, Dennis Leary, and I thought it was terrific.  I've never considered my neck.  I want to have a beautiful neck.  You know, guys, you've got a great neck.  Thank you.  I've been told it's younger looking. 
[01:27:00]  You have a good neck, Dennis Leary.  See?  I'm not even going to talk about my fucking neck.  I'm not going to talk about my neck.  Let me ask you this.  Yes.  Martin Sheen.  Holy fuck, is he good at everything he plays.  Isn't he unbelievable?  And a nice neck.  Nice neck.  Nice guy, too, right?  Great guy.  He seems like he's a down-to-earth, blue-collar type of guy.  We're supposed to get him in to promote Spider-Man.  Really?  No?  No.  You're the only one from Spider-Man.  Let me tell you something.  I did a movie with him called Monument Ave years ago that Ted Demme directed, and he 
[01:27:30]  played...  I don't know if you've ever seen it, but in it he plays a cop that's investigating these  murders in Boston, and then there's a twist.  It required...  I mean, he was great in the movie, and it requires a turn, and it's on camera in front of me  when he makes it.  So, of course, we hired him because he's Martin Sheen.  Yeah.  I've got to tell you something.  Working with that guy, it was so scary how good an actor he was.  And I knew he was good, but in front of me when I was doing it, I was so intimidated  by him as an actor.  But he's got a great evil side that he's in. 
[01:28:00]  Now we know him as like, you know, he played the American president on television and everything,  but the guy is...  You ever see the movie Badlands?  Oh, it's a great movie.  Yeah, with him in Sissy Spacek, which is a true story about a serial murderer.  I never saw that.  Yeah.  I didn't miss that one.  It's not on Netflix yet, but if you...  Is it a new?  I think you can get on a DVD.  No, it's from 72.  Oh, oh, oh.  It's him and Warren Oates and Sissy Spacek based on a true story.  Oh, God.  We got two.  And I'll tell you something.  You watch that movie, the performance he gives in that movie, and you just go like, 
[01:28:30]  this guy, there's evil in this man.  I think he's going places, this kid.  In real life, he's the nicest guy in the world, but man, what a great fucking actor.  He's the nicest celebrity I've ever met.  Is he really?  Him and Emilio came in.  Emilio is pretty nice, man.  But Martin Sheen is so warm.  Yeah.  Like, he's just, he makes you, he's just, he has an amazing vibe to him.  Yeah, he's really, he's very aggressive when you're around him.  Did I come in aggressive?  I thought I just came in as myself.  The fuck's with you guys?  He started pounding on your Celtics the second you walked in, so, you know. 
[01:29:00]  Well, because I got the Knicks thing.  You put him on the defensive.  Let me ask you one thing.  No, it's not defensive.  Let me tell you something.  You got to win game six at home.  And that game, we weren't even in that game.  And that, it was over then.  And it's like, and listen, I know we are old, but that game just said, that old written  all over it.  We just did not show up.  You can't go back.  And I wanted LeBron to win after that.  At that point, I was like, why do you want LeBron to win if you're a basketball fan?  Why do you not want LeBron?  What's your problem with LeBron?  Because I like hating him.  You just like hating him. 
[01:29:30]  You're a selfish motherfucker.  You are into your own fucking hate and revenge.  You don't hate sports stars.  There's got to be, who do you hate in sports?  The New York Yankees.  But I love hate them.  That's my LeBron James.  But I love hate them.  You can't have the Red Sox.  I love hate LeBron James.  Right.  But now I feel like.  You need to hate the Yankees to feel better about the Red Sox.  I wanted LeBron to get his championship brain.  You really did, huh?  Just get it over with?  I like Dwyane Wade, so.  Dwyane Wade, he's a fine.  Now you can hate him and keep him from getting a second ring.  No, it doesn't matter, though, as much.  It was kind of fun that he was.  You have weak hate. 
[01:30:00]  You have weak hate.  It was fun that he was having a tough time getting that ring.  Strong neck, weak hate.  Yeah, well, after.  Not a strong neck.  I said, it's just hanging.  After the Sox won the series, that was pretty much it for the whole, you know, Curse of the  Vendino.  See, that sucked, too, when the Sox finally won it.  It kind of ruined it for Yankees fans, yeah.  You can't really keep hating as much.  It doesn't matter as much.  You don't have that big, good comeback anymore, you know?  I know.  I know.  I know the feeling.  Yeah.  It was fun.  I know.  It's over.  It is over.  Were you in that helicopter in Spider-Man?  Yes, I was.  Here was my deal with that. 
[01:30:30]  And actually.  There's some good helicopter scenes with Dennis Lurie for the people that haven't seen it.  For the people that haven't seen it.  Spoiler.  My kids, obviously, like anybody's kids, don't think I'm cool.  That stopped.  As soon as they hit the teenage years, the whole cool thing went out the window.  That's crazy.  Don't make jokes in front of my friends.  Don't, you know, drop me off two blocks from school.  Pick me up two blocks from school.  So the first time I got to be cool again was when they found out I was doing the movie.  And they love Emma Stone.  They love Andrew Garfield.  They came to the set.  They got to meet them.  And it was also the day I was doing some of my helicopter stunts. 
[01:31:00]  On the way home that night, my daughter goes,  Dad, that was so cool.  You were so cool jumping in that helicopter.  And I'm like, wow.  Major points.  Did that last the drive home?  Yeah.  By the time we got home, I was like, let me out of the car first.  Yeah, you're terrible.  But you know what?  They thought the other night, I flew them out to L.A. with me.  And they brought their friends.  Wow, that's pretty good.  And they thought I was really cool on the red carpet because, you know.  That's awesome.  Yeah.  You know.  When they don't think you're cool, you should be like, yeah, what do you think the guy who's 
[01:31:30]  the plumber, his daughter thinks of him?  Same thing.  You know, it's a different thing.  I mean, it doesn't matter.  It's all the same shit, right?  Do you remember that age?  You know, it's like, there's that thing when you're a teenager until like 22 or 23 when  you don't think your dad or your mom is cool.  And then around 20.  Then you come back.  25, you come back.  Come back around, yeah.  So I got him a little earlier with how old he was.  But you're Dennis Leary.  It doesn't matter to him.  It doesn't matter.  It's more embarrassing.  Oh, God.  Because everybody knows.  I know.  Everybody knows him.  Ew.  It makes me wonder, like, did Stella McCartney think her dad was uncool? 
[01:32:00]  Of course.  Of course, right?  Paul McCartney forgot to say, yeah.  So Mick Jagger's daughter's like, Dad, drop me off two blocks from.  That's so weird.  You know?  Stop singing that song.  Dad, stop moving like that.  Don't dance at the party, Dad.  It's embarrassing.  Were you on any of the tall buildings or was that all CGI?  No, we did.  It was a mixture.  So we did, you know, the bridge work and the tall buildings work.  It's like a little bit of tall building and tall bridge work.  And then you do a lot of green screen.  But we did very little pure green screen in this. 
[01:32:30]  Do you do any stunts?  Because Cruz did his own things on the Burj Khalif Tower.  I did a lot of shit on Rescue Me that I never should have done that I did because there  was a bunch of firefighters around who were my friends.  And they were like, yeah, it's simple.  You do this and then you do this.  You're showing off.  Yeah.  Well, I wasn't even showing off.  It's not a pussy.  Can't do it?  Yeah, exactly.  Right?  So on this one, I was like, I'm going to do, I'm looking at the script.  I'm going, I'm going to do this and this and this and this and this.  And I'm thinking, Andrew was doing a lot of his own shit. 
[01:33:00]  He's young.  Uh, so the guy comes in one day, uh, the, uh, Vic and Andy Armstrong, great stunt coordinators.  And you'll see, you saw the movie, a lot of that shit where Andrew's really swinging  and like the thing, I don't know if you remember the scene where, uh, where he takes off the  first time I come after him with all the guys and he's swinging under the bridge.  Yeah, of course.  That was shot here uptown, up in Harlem.  And he, that's really him and the stunt guy bouncing off the side of the truck, falling  off the truck.  That's all real.  That's not CGI stuff.  Holy shit.  So Vic and Andy Armstrong, who were famous stunt coordinators, designed a lot of shit 
[01:33:30]  that they rehearsed forever in LA before we shot it in New York, where Andrew did a lot  of it himself and his stunt double, like actual climbing and bouncing off shit and all that  stuff.  Wow.  So I'm like, fuck man, this kid's like, you know, six and he's like, I got to do something.  And then they, they come in with this harness one day and I trust these guys, the Armstrong  brothers are like, uh, I said, what's that?  They said, this is your repelling harness.  We're going to have you, uh, cause you started the helicopter work already.  So we're going to have you repel. 
[01:34:00]  By the way, I remember that word from rescue me when they say repel.  And I'm like, I know what that means.  That means flying out backwards down a bit.  Yeah.  And he's like, we're gonna have you repel from the helicopter.  I'm like, how far?  He's like, well, as far as you can go.  Like four stories.  I'm like, I'm not doing fucking four stories.  I did it on rescue me where you have your legs on a building and you bounce off.  Yeah.  I'm like, I'm not doing four stories.  What about three?  Yeah.  So we go to LA for something.  We're out there shooting.  And he comes in again.  And he's like, Hey, how about that high? 
[01:34:30]  And he points to the side of the soundstage.  And I go, you know what I'm doing?  Here's what I'm doing.  Okay.  I'm in the helicopter.  Keith, my double, Keith, my double repels as high as you want.  18 stories.  Right.  He lands with his back to the camera.  I do the fake land, unhook myself, turn around and walk over to Spider-Man, which is what  I did.  And you can't tell.  I literally, I went from here to here, which is what you see in the movie.  Basically, you're on your tippy toes is what he just showed us.  You know, in the movie, you see Spider-Man in the foreground. 
[01:35:00]  That's me in the background.  Let me ask you this then.  Your stunt double obviously looks very much like you.  Oh, Keith's the best, man.  I used him on Seven Years of Rescue Me.  You can't tell.  You can't tell at all.  I'm at the point with Keith where I'm like, Keith, it says in the script, vigorous walking.  That's going to be it.  Okay?  Now you use him in real life.  He's in the car with the kids.  Exactly.  He jumps him off his wall.  I got him.  Keith, it's snowing outside.  Let's go.  Get the shovel.  Yeah, he's great.  And you know what?  I'm 54 years old, man.  And I've done a lot of crazy shit, but I ain't doing it anymore.  And Tom Cruise, they said that. 
[01:35:30]  You know, Tom does everything.  Get Tom.  Put a blonde wig on him and a SWAT vest and have him rappel out of the helicopter.  I'm not doing it.  Why didn't you want?  Are you scared of falling?  Or is it just a lot of work to rappel?  I'm old, man.  And I've done, on Rescue Me, I did some crazy shit that I'm sure looks great on camera.  I know it looked great when we were putting it together.  But, like, you know, I've lived a crazy life.  I did a lot of crazy shit and I still play hockey.  So, my thing is like, I've already done.  You don't want to pull out a knee or anything.  I hung around with Lenny Clark for 30 years. 
[01:36:00]  You know how crazy that is?  I mean, and I'm alive.  So, I just feel like, hey, stunt guys are great.  And I'm telling you right now, I have no problem saying that Keith, my stunt guy, I don't know, you know, how many times I could say that guy makes me look like a hero.  And he gets paid for it.  So, rather than have him sitting over there going, look pretty good, Dennis, I'd rather be sitting there going, Keith, fantastic, go higher, go higher.  Try one more, one more.  Make me look good.  But I ask all this because the CGI in this movie, you can't tell.  It's amazing. 
[01:36:30]  Yeah, there's very, I mean, I got to say the guy, the director wanted to do as little as he could.  And Andrew was trained as a gymnast.  So, he did a lot of stuff.  And again, same, like in the fight scene with me, you know, I won't give anything away, but, you know, there's one scene where I, when I rappel out of, when Keith rappels out of the helicopter and then I unhook myself.  Like, he did a lot of that stuff himself.  But, you know, he's 26.  I'm old enough to be his old man.  I'm not doing it anymore.  And I want to talk about the fight scenes for a second now, too. 
[01:37:00]  Because for a while in movies, they went with that extreme close-up fight shit.  Which I like.  I like, in the Bourne movies, that stuff can be great.  It's overplayed now, and they don't have that in this movie.  Yeah, that's true.  I like a lot of it.  It's overplayed.  You can really see the fights in this movie.  Yeah.  I like when the fights are pretty realistic.  Because, you know, real fights are messy.  Right.  You know?  Yeah, yeah.  You know what I mean?  I'm sick of movie fights.  It's not, and it usually isn't like knock down, drag out.  No, it isn't.  It's biting, falling, kicking, grabbing, you know, hitting each other with crap that you fight. 
[01:37:30]  That's why there's a, I think it's the middle or the third Bourne movie with Matt Damon.  Where they did a lot of close fight work, and they kept the camera and didn't cut a lot.  Right.  Also, that movie Haywire, did you see that?  I did not.  With that girl who's a...  Yeah, she was in here too.  Yeah.  And there's a lot of fights in that movie where it's really her, and they don't cut.  Is that a good movie?  You know what?  It was a, it's a pretty good movie, man.  He shot it in like 30 days in Dublin.  I gotta watch that.  And she was good.  Do you see everything, or do you try to see everything? 
[01:38:00]  It seems like you see a lot of movies.  I see a lot of movies.  I rarely see ones that I'm in unless I produce them or something.  So, but this one I had to go because the kids were...  Why don't you want to see yourself after you film this thing?  I know it's hard to explain, but like on Rescue Me or on a movie that I produce or that I'm  involved with, I can have a different head.  So when I look at it, I'm not thinking about me and my performance and what I could have  done better.  I have a responsibility as a producer and or a writer to go...  You look at the whole project.  The game's working.  But vanity and ego take over for me.  Even when I watched Spider-Man the other night, I'm going, I could have done that better. 
[01:38:30]  Oh, shit.  Really?  And also 3D, I'm going like, oh my God, look at my nose!  Oh my God, look at my bone!  You know, so that's just human nature.  I think there's something wrong when you have an actor friend and he's like, hey, I'm having  a screening at my house on my new TV show.  And you go, and the guy's like, pretty good, huh?  Check me out.  I'm like, dude, what the fuck?  You know, that's like, you really should, you should be in the other direction.  Like, I think I can do it better.  How many times, that's happened to me a lot, where I don't go anymore.  Guys go like, hey, I'm having a screening at my new TV pilot. 
[01:39:00]  You're like, I'm not going.  No.  With all your friends and your relatives.  Yeah.  Aren't I great?  It's embarrassing.  Look how good I am.  Wait, wait, you talked through that.  Let me rewind.  Yeah, let me rewind.  Watch what I do here.  Watch this.  It's hilarious.  Fuck you, man.  I hate watching my song.  That's the way to feel.  So does the audience.  Hey.  That wasn't nice.  That's not nice.  Wow.  Jimmy.  That is a little fucker.  Cheap shot, man.  Cheap shot.  He's right. 
[01:39:30]  He's completely right.  Back to Spider-Man.  One-armed guy in real life has two arms.  Yes.  How the fuck do they do that?  You know what they do?  They erase it.  I got to tell you.  Because, you know, I was wondering how good it was going to look.  Yeah.  He walks around with different levels of a green screen glove on his hand and his arm and  every scene that he's acting in.  And so, you know, you're walking around all day and he's smoking on the set with the green  arm and everything going like, how good this is going to look. 
[01:40:00]  And I spent a lot of time staring at it at the premiere the other night.  I couldn't find any flaws.  No, it's unbelievable.  Because I've seen him in all the movies.  Yeah.  He has two arms.  No, they have to pop the background in behind him after that.  It's unbelievable, right?  I don't get it.  I don't even know how they do it.  That would be rough.  Because it's almost like he would be green screened into every shot because they need  the background.  Yeah.  But I guess they have to go in and paint each frame or something.  Wow.  It's crazy.  Brutal.  It looked terrific.  They must have a computer that does that.  Yeah, motion capture and all that shit.  Somebody still has to do it, though, right? 
[01:40:30]  Right.  Somebody's got to do it.  But you know, when you have each individual frame.  Yeah.  When they have those big budgets, I don't think they do it.  I've got a dumb technical question.  Why did they pick green for green screening?  It used to be blue, I think, with blue screen.  It's not a color found in a lot of natural tones in your body.  That's why.  This conversation is riveting.  Blue was.  It was 10 seconds, Dennis Lurie.  I want to learn.  I was curious.  They used blue.  They used to use blue.  Yeah.  Your guy said they used blue.  That's right.  It's blue isn't bad if you're doing models and stuff like that.  But for people, green is much better. 
[01:41:00]  It's a weird green, too.  It's not an army green.  It's a weird.  It's almost like a Celtics type of green.  Like neon green.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That would key out quite nicely, that shirt.  You're right.  Stupid.  I'm fascinated with green screen.  We even used green screen in the video.  That would key out quite nicely.  All I talked about was green screening and necks.  Fucking guy.  Green screening and necks.  Unbelievable.  This is going to fucking come out.  What kind of fucking bullshit is this?  Let's talk about the song.  What's your issue with this?  There was green screening in the video.  I love Dennis. 
[01:41:30]  Kiss my ass.  That's how he started.  I'm funny or die.  Yeah.  Kiss my ass.  It's pretty much telling everybody in the world, hey, look, we're American.  We got our foibles, but kiss my ass.  Yeah, exactly right.  That's it in a nutshell.  Yeah.  Right.  Exactly.  We're Americans.  We like to eat.  We like to drive big trucks, watch 3D TV, and suck up gasoline.  Do whatever the fuck we want.  You know why?  Because we're America.  Right.  What do you think of Obamacare, speaking of America?  Here's what I think about Obamacare.  I think that obviously with, what is it, one or two out of every three people being massively 
[01:42:00]  overweight, which of course leads to early onset diabetes, blah, blah, blah, we have  to do something about health care in this country.  We have to.  Nobody wants to admit it.  Everybody's pissed off.  I don't want, you know, to be taken care of by the government.  But you know what?  We got to do something because we end up paying for it anyways, you know?  Yeah.  When the fat guy or the sick person decides eventually, oh, something's wrong with me  and they don't have health coverage and they go into the hospital or the emergency room,  who pays for it?  We do. 
[01:42:30]  It comes right out of our pockets.  So I like to have a system where we're not paying as much to take care of people who  don't want to take care of themselves.  Let's buy America a salad.  Let's buy America a salad.  That's the B side of the, uh?  Yeah, that's it.  That's the B side.  The B side.  You know what I mean?  That's how I feel about it.  So I don't know if it's exactly the right thing, but something's got to be done.  I think preventative, uh, more than preventative care would be good.  There are a bunch of overweight people that just really, it's like, what are you doing?  What the fuck are you doing?  You don't see it a lot in New York, but when you go to Times Square or anywhere in 
[01:43:00]  that area and you have to do some business during the day and you look at people and  you go, what the fuck is going on with these people?  Most New Yorkers are not fat because they're walking a lot.  I know, but it's just unbelievable how big people are.  You forget.  What do you think of the mayor's, uh, he wants to ban the big soft drinks.  Isn't that stupid, though?  Yep.  Totally agree.  It's stupid, right?  You're talking to the wrong guy.  It's a dictatorship.  I think we should be able to smoke where we used to be able to smoke, which I still do.  I don't care.  You still smoke.  I smoke everywhere, man.  I light up everywhere.  I literally light up everywhere. 
[01:43:30]  I smoked in a hospital.  I love that when the doctors used to smoke in movies in the hospital.  They're like, well, let's take a look at your chart.  You're doing quite well.  Ashes are going on the guy's bed.  Where have you been told you couldn't smoke?  Peter Falk taught me a thing years ago.  I was doing a movie with him and he lit up in some place that he wasn't supposed to smoke.  We were on set.  I was like, what are you doing?  He's like, I'm going to get at least five or six puffs in before they tell me to put it out.  And I was like, oh yeah.  So you want to go to a hospital?  Well, first of all, you get an extra 10 seconds in a hospital because they can't believe they look three times like, that's not really. 
[01:44:00]  Is he really?  That can't be.  So you've already got two puffs in before they start walking towards you.  And even if they yell, hey, what do you think you're doing?  You go, did you?  So you can get away with a lot.  Sure.  There's no smoking in here.  And I don't think the key to curing fat people's problems is 32-ounce sodas at the movies.  No.  You know?  I mean, that's not it.  It's when they go home.  Lifestyle issue.  There's other problems in New York before you have to worry about fucking soft drinks. 
[01:44:30]  Really?  It took me, I was telling him, I went and played golf Friday, two and a half hours to get back into the city where I live.  Two and a half fucking hours.  There's a major commuting problem in this fucking city.  But he would rather go after this easy shit.  Two and a half hours?  I was out of my mind.  What time of the day was this?  It was, I mean, it was Friday at five.  But I was going the other way, Dennis.  There is no other way at Friday at five.  I was going the other way.  I was coming back in.  You got the traffic from the people that turned around and said, fuck this traffic. 
[01:45:00]  Here's what I love.  Yeah.  Here's what I love.  I decided not to lie.  I was going to lie because I knew where you were going.  I'm like, fuck, I'm fucked here.  I love the fact that he fucks up and it's the mayor's fault.  God damn, the mayor, I'm stuck in traffic at five o'clock on a Friday in New York.  Two and a half hours of the free world, New York City.  I'm stuck in traffic.  Everyone's leaving the city on a Friday.  Five o'clock on Friday.  There's no good way.  You're leaving.  I'm not coming back in.  You could fly in in a fucking helicopter on Friday and it would take three hours.  I'm still going to hit helicopter traffic. 
[01:45:30]  It's helicopter traffic.  I don't know why they call it rush hour.  No one's going anywhere.  Oh, yeah.  There you go.  As soon as Dennis asked me what time I panicked, I'm like, ah, I'm fucked here.  I knew there was a real reason behind me.  Is that a bad one?  Double guns.  You shouldn't have been playing golf on Friday.  I shouldn't be playing golf at all.  I suck right now.  Golf sucks.  Horrible.  You're not a golf guy.  I used to like golf.  I had to give it up.  But hockey guys like golf usually.  I know.  But I had my own tournament.  I had a charity tournament.  But that last time I played was like five years ago, the last time I had the tournament. 
[01:46:00]  Let's face it.  I mean, I love doing the tournament because that's just a good time.  But I can't fucking play it anymore.  I can't master it.  What broke you?  Like, what made you?  I remember when you...  No, no, no, no.  I mean, what broke...  Making you famous.  I remember you were doing...  Oh, I thought you meant about golf.  What broke being famous?  No, what made you...  Because I remember when I was younger watching you do the CTV.  I want Cindy TV on MTV.  It was like a big image spot.  Was that the one that actually put you...  Here's what happened.  The image spots.  Remote control.  I go to remote control.  Actually, it goes like this.  College. 
[01:46:30]  I was in the Emerson Comedy Workshop.  We did some stuff for the...  You know, in the theater.  But we did stuff for the TV station.  The guy who ran the TV station in my class was Doug Herzog.  Doug Herzog leaves.  We graduated.  He goes, I'm starting this new network that runs music videos 24 hours a day.  We all go, you're fucking crazy.  Within five years, he goes, I got a show called Remote Control with Ober and Quinn.  Quinn and Ober say we got Leary Sandler and Mike Armstrong.  And John Teneyke.  These were all guys from the Comedy Workshop.  I go there. 
[01:47:00]  I start doing characters on that.  Ted Demme's doing Yo!  MTV Raps.  It takes off.  I met Ted at Remote Control.  Wow.  Doug says to Ted, what do you want to do?  I had just done No Cure for Cancer, which was running off Broadway.  Ted goes, I want to take Dennis and just go out to Roosevelt Island and shoot these crazy fucking spots.  And that's how it broke.  Those are the image spots with Cindy Crawford.  Yeah, so the spots broke when No Cure for Cancer broke and it all kind of happened at once.  So you never struggled?  Son of a bitch.  Never struggled.  Son of a bitch.  So you never worked an honest day in your life.  Never worked an honest day. 
[01:47:30]  But you know, I'd like to say that struggling includes, which I consider real struggle,  having to see Lenny Clark quite often in his underwear or completely naked in his house,  like half a block from my house, going like, Lenny, Lenny, calm down.  Calm down.  Calm down, Lenny.  Calm down.  You're sweating.  You're sweating a lot.  No one's here to get you.  I love Lenny Clark.  He hasn't been on the show in a while.  Really?  Yeah, I don't know what that's about.  I don't know.  We're going to have to figure it out. 
[01:48:00]  He's hanging out.  You know, he's down to his original weight.  He's like a buck ninety now.  And he kept it.  He kept it off.  To his credit.  He must be working out like an animal.  He's addicted to it.  He works out like a fucking animal.  He rides his bike like two hours in the morning.  Then he goes to the gym and works out.  What a complete change.  I know.  He hangs by his knees and does upside down sit-ups.  Oh, he does.  It's crazy.  Oh, yeah.  He got stuck.  There are movies that are doing it.  We were in California.  He got stuck.  He went to the Muscle Beach at Venice.  And my son went with him because my son hadn't witnessed the upside down, you know. 
[01:48:30]  Upside down Lenny.  You know, Lenny.  And he took the gravity boots and he hooked himself on the monkey bars there.  And he got stuck.  And Jack had gone to get something to eat.  And there was nobody around.  And he was stuck.  And he thought he was going to die.  And I was like, that would have been great if you died that way.  Just hang in there.  Because there would have been pictures.  Somebody would have taken a picture of you.  Like Mussolini.  You know what I mean?  How did he finally get out of it?  Somebody came along and went, you need help?  And he's like, yes, please.  And then he lifted him up.  You know.  They don't really make those gravity boots anymore. 
[01:49:00]  No.  He saved them from the Richard Gere days.  I'm not even joking.  They're kind of like illegal or something.  Really?  Why are they illegal?  Because you can die anymore.  Because that situation.  That's the gym told me.  How many crunches was he doing?  A lot.  He's crazy.  I hate crunches.  He's insane.  Obviously.  I'm with you, brother.  Crunches.  I'm trying to think what else I'm supposed to ask you about Spider-Man.  But, I mean, the movie's going to kill.  The movie's going to kill.  Ice Age comes out on the 13th, which is, I hopefully, also going to kill. 
[01:49:30]  It's great.  Great for the kids.  Great for the family.  Kiss My Ass on Funny or Die.  As of right now, the video and the song available on iTunes right now.  That's right.  And really debuts tomorrow, but it's on iTunes right now if you want to sneak in and get it.  Hey, and coming up in December or October, the book.  Oh, shit.  The Christmas book.  Merry Fucking Christmas.  Merry Fucking Christmas song we turned into a kid's book.  Wow.  Which comes out Christmas time, yeah. 
[01:50:00]  And it benefits the Leary Firefighters Foundation.  Is the word fuck in it?  Yeah, it's Merry Fucking Christmas.  You know what?  I'm not bringing that home to my son.  I'm sorry.  Why not?  He can't see that.  That's a good bedside room.  No, I'm sorry.  It's for you.  Tuck him in.  It's for grown-up kids.  It's for him when he's sitting by the pool in the wintertime going, why is it frozen?  What the fuck?  This sucks.  I keep firing bullets into it.  Nothing's happening.  No matter how high I turned my heater up.  Last time I saw you, you were telling me, or you showed me a video of you and James Bond  Oh, yeah.  Shooting guns.  Shooting guns at us.  That actually scared James Bond. 
[01:50:30]  At the range.  Yeah, I was shooting a 50 Cal.  I call him James Bond because I love him.  Which James Bond?  Daniel Craig.  Daniel Craig.  I just love him.  Daniel Craig hung out for a while.  Did you see James Bond in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo?  I haven't seen that one yet, either.  My God, he was great in that.  No, the guy's a great actor.  I haven't seen those.  I gotta see that.  Oh, my God.  He's fantastic in that movie.  I suck.  That's a chick flick.  I saw the first Planet of the Apes on that.  Yeah, that was the last movie I saw.  Did you see the new Rise of the Planet of the Apes?  I liked it.  It was great. 
[01:51:00]  I liked it.  Great.  You think they're going to do another one?  Yeah, they are.  They should.  They're doing it right now.  I like their angle on that.  Thank Dennis.  It's kind of a throwaway movie, too.  Is it time for us to go?  No, thank Dennis for the Firefighters Fund.  Oh.  My dad's a volunteer fireman.  That's right.  In Manetta, Virginia.  Very good.  Oh, look at that.  There, run.  Hey, where are you at with stand-up?  Do you have time at this point?  No, I don't have time right now.  So, the next gig scheduled for me is Comics Come Home 19.  Wow, I can't believe it.  Holy shit.  In Boston, November, I think. 
[01:51:30]  19 already?  Yeah, November 15th or something like that.  I want to go this year.  I haven't been in a while.  Yeah, man.  I haven't done one.  It's great.  Yeah, Jim does it.  No, I know.  I used to go up there all the time.  I've done, too.  Yeah, I love that gig.  That is a fun thing.  I know, man.  Went to the one, like, fuck, probably 17 years ago or something.  You know what I mean?  I'll tell you.  It was sad this year because it was, you know, Patrice was hanging on when we did it.  And so, we didn't want to bum the audience out.  But we also wanted to get people.  We knew they knew.  We wanted to get people to send out good vibes. 
[01:52:00]  So, that was weird, you know, because he did that so many times in so many different iterations  of his act and just crushed in the crowd.  He took, you know, it's Patrice.  Yeah.  And that was really, that was a bizarre night because it was, all of us were thinking the  same thing.  And you went through it.  So, it's just, it was tough, man.  It was really tough.  No one can replace that guy.  No.  There are some people, unfortunately, there are some people, you can't replace anybody. 
[01:52:30]  But there are some people who are like, ah, he kind of fits into the slot there.  He fits the world.  Yeah.  Not him.  No one.  No one.  We have discussions on this show about certain things.  You just know, God, we need Patrice here for that.  And I still can't listen to his voice to this day.  I still haven't.  I haven't listened to any of the bits.  I haven't listened to his new album that everyone's saying is great.  I haven't.  I can't.  I can't do it.  Let's tell you, man.  That guy, he was, like, I remember a night, I can't remember which comics come home it was.  But it was around 2004. 
[01:53:00]  I think it was right after the Red Sox won that time, or maybe it was 2007.  But it was a big Red Sox time, right?  The Red Sox had just won another championship, or the first one.  And he comes up.  I hadn't seen him yet.  I saw him backstage.  I hadn't seen him in his stage clothes.  He comes walking up, and he's got a Yankee hat on, right?  Which is like a silver and blue one, and a silver and blue outfit.  So the other guy's on.  And I go, what the fuck?  And he goes, what?  I go, you know they're going to boo you when he walks out.  He goes, yeah, I know.  So I said, what are you going to do?  He goes, I'll deal with it.  So, of course, I go out.  They know halfway through his intro who it is. 
[01:53:30]  He comes out.  They're going nuts, and they see the hat, and they start booing.  8,000 people booing, right?  And they boo longer than they normally would, because they probably figure in their heads,  like, he's going to make us pay for this.  And he does, like, five minutes about, fuck you, I'm wearing a Yankee thing because it  matches my socks.  And he just goes off the deep end.  And the next thing you know, he's got them eaten out of the palm of his hand and fucking  gets a standing ovation when he finishes.  That's balls.  But he did it on purpose.  Yeah, I know.  That's balls. 
[01:54:00]  To do it on purpose like that.  I mean...  He's the only one that could get away with wearing a Yankee hat like that and actually  having the people turn around.  Yeah.  Because he legitimately wasn't afraid of the audience.  No.  He legitimately didn't give a fuck if they booed him or not.  Yeah.  And people can sense when that's real.  Yeah.  And with him, it was absolutely real.  Yeah.  Yeah, he wanted them to.  Yeah.  It was more enjoyable for him that night.  Yeah.  You can see, he was having a great time, and it's infectious, you know?  Yeah.  This guy's been talking a lot.  Who is he?  This is Chris Phillips.  He's been here before.  He's joking, Dennis, but they don't know out there. 
[01:54:30]  Okay, Chris Phillips.  That's right.  I never got introduced.  He is my co-writer on...  But he wasn't introduced today.  That's what I'm saying.  On all the songs that we do, he co-wrote the Asshole Song.  He co-wrote all our...  You guys go way back.  Go way back.  Yeah, we were at Emerson at the Comedy Workshop.  That's right.  You're another Emerson guy.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  The core of my band, Adam and Chris and myself...  Adam and the other guitarist.  Right.  And Adam's brother, Charlie, to a certain extent.  We have been together since the Comedy Workshop at Emerson, which was 1976.  So it's...  So you guys know each other since you're 18 or whatever?  36 years. 
[01:55:00]  A lot of years.  What year did you start performing?  I started in the Extinction Agency at Emerson.  In 75, but the Comedy Workshop started in 76, which was me, Mario Cantone, Lauren Dombrowski,  Chris, Adam, Eddie Brill, who works at Letterman now.  Steve Wright did a couple of things.  Eddie Brill wasn't around in the 70s.  Yeah.  Steven Wright.  He was in black and white back then.  We finally had Steven Wright come in.  We've had him on a couple times.  He was awesome.  He was unbelievable.  I think he had a good time, too. 
[01:55:30]  Oh, he did.  He had a great time.  He was awesome.  You know, it's unbelievable that he's starting to get a little more outgoing as we get older.  Because, you know, he just stayed...  He would just perform and disappear.  That's what he would do for years.  I thought it was kind of part of his act until I met him.  I'm like, okay.  No, no, no.  That's Steven Wright.  Let me tell you something.  You know Steven's famous joke about he decided to listen to a record that teaches you how  to speak Chinese, but he fell asleep and the record skipped, so now he can speak stutters 
[01:56:00]  in Chinese.  He lived around the corner from me for years with these two guys named the Ball Brothers  who were also involved with the Comedy Workshop.  They used to have these big parties.  So it was a three-bedroom apartment, but it was pretty big.  I was there one night at a party.  Steven's there at the beginning, and there's all these hot chicks, and then Steven disappears  and, like, three hours later, I go, where's Steve?  I don't know.  Let's go find him.  We go open the door to his room, and there's, like, a hundred people in his apartment partying.  He's in his bed with his headphones on, big old-ass 70s headphones, listening to records. 
[01:56:30]  We're like, what the fuck are you doing?  He's like, oh, this is a record that teaches you how to speak French.  Come on.  12 o'clock on a Friday night.  Come on.  What the fuck?  That's really what he was like.  Yeah.  Was he going to finish with a party?  That's okay.  I mean, no more so than anybody else at that time.  You know, in the late 70s.  Yeah, exactly.  He was a very shy guy, but he was fucking twisted and funny as shit.  You were performing in the early 80s?  For some reason, I thought you started, like, late 80s. 
[01:57:00]  I don't know why.  No, no.  I started in, after we graduated, we kept the comedy workshop as a comedy group for a little bit.  Lauren and Mario Cantone immediately went over to start doing Lenny's open mic night at the Ding Ho.  So, I went over and saw Lenny and went, well, fuck, if Lenny can do it, I can do it.  So, I started going up 1980.  Oh, my.  And I kept bombing.  And Lenny kept going, keep coming, keep coming.  So, I kept coming.  And, eventually, Mario and Lauren broke up because they were driving each other fucking crazy. 
[01:57:30]  And Lauren became a solo stand-up as well.  I was dating Lauren at the time.  And then we had a horrible, nasty breakup.  But I stuck with it because I fucking was doing Lenny's show.  Lenny Clark actually was the biggest influence on me besides Pryor and Carlin stand-up-wise.  Wow.  Really?  Yeah.  I just...  Why?  Because of the...  I loved Pryor and Carlin when I realized I had this angry-smoking guy from this character  in the Bill and Bob sketches in the Emerson Comedy Workshop, which always went over big.  It was, like, one of the many characters we would all play in. 
[01:58:00]  And the Bill and Bob angry-smoking guys always was big.  So, when I started to do stand-up, Lenny kept making me come back.  And I'd come back.  And, eventually, I found that voice again.  And, also, Lenny was, like, a street guy, a working-class guy.  So, when I watched him just go up and, like, start talking about anything that was in the news,  I was, like, fuck, that's...  I can do it.  And he kept telling me to come back.  He would just put me on.  So, eventually, I mean, I really owe him for that.  But he was a big influence on me. 
[01:58:30]  Because he was, like, you can talk about anything.  Just get the fuck up there and do it.  And I was, like...  And he's, like, smoke on stage.  Go ahead.  I'm, like, fuck.  I mean, when you're starting stand-up, it's so intimidating that it's hard to see, you know,  the windows and the doors.  But because of him, I kept getting up on stage.  And eventually, you know, he did.  He kept encouraging you.  You're also trying to do something you've seen.  Like, it's probably very hard to be yourself when you first started getting up there.  But he was truly himself.  Yeah.  So, when I realized, like, Lenny offstage and Lenny onstage, it was the same guy just exaggerated.  I was, like, oh, okay. 
[01:59:00]  Got it.  Got it.  You know, like, that meant a lot to me.  Yeah.  Every comic says either Pryor or Carlin.  Yeah.  And you wish you had a better...  For me, it's those guys...  And Woody in the 60s.  Yeah.  I wish I had a better answer.  I wish I could say Jake Johansson or something so original, you know?  I don't even know who the third guy would be that I hear a lot.  I always hear Carl and Pryor.  Cosby.  Lenny Bruce.  Cosby probably makes it.  Yeah.  Or, um...  Listen, man.  I don't know how many times people have said it.  I know Louis C.K. said it recently.  But if you haven't seen Cosby in a long time, do yourself a favor.  Go see him live. 
[01:59:30]  Fucking guy is...  He was always great.  He's still fucking great.  Now, I like Pryor better because I like that edgier, like, you know, that was my thing.  But Bill Cosby is just a master.  A fucking master.  Pryor said all the stuff that Cosby probably wishes he could have said on stage.  But I saw Cosby recently at the Borgata.  I've never seen him live.  Yeah.  And I met him here once briefly.  And I was like, I gotta see this guy live.  And he was awesome.  I mean, he probably did an hour and a half.  And the first 15, 20 minutes was slow.  Because you could see he was working on something.  But he didn't give a fuck. 
[02:00:00]  Like, I've never seen anybody own the space like that.  He was just...  It was about a thousand people.  I mean, perfect silence while he was working.  Like, and I mean, like, when you needed silence.  Like, not during the punchline.  Yeah, not during the punchline.  You don't want that silence.  While he was crafting through this character stuff, it was just...  He had them.  And when he wanted to get a laugh, it was effortless.  Like, you could see, like, as a comic, you could see, like, okay,  now he's trying because he wants to make sure that the show goes well. 
[02:00:30]  Effortless.  And he does a lot of shit about, like, he's up to date.  He talks about being a grandfather and getting old.  And the grandkids bugging the shit out of him.  I mean, it's great, man.  He's going to be 75 July 12th.  Is he really?  Just looked him up, yeah.  Wow.  July 12th, Bill Cosby, 75.  When I met him here, Ron Bennington was interviewing him.  And there was a technical problem.  So this guy walks me in and he goes,  Hey, Bill, Jim's a comic, too.  Which I felt bad because Ron was there.  But literally, the guy just introduced me.  And so fucking Cosby started asking me questions about stand-up. 
[02:01:00]  He's like, What made you want to do it?  How long have you been doing it?  Oh, he just basically interviewed me on why I became a comic.  Wow.  What were your influences?  It was really weird, but he was genuinely listening and interested to hear the answers.  He wasn't just being polite.  No.  Why would he?  Because he was asking me questions, which was bizarre.  He had no idea what it was.  It was just a very odd.  That's kind of cool.  It was an insight into his mind, maybe.  That's probably why he's so good at what he does, because he listens.  Like, he really fucking listens.  You know what's weird, too?  If you go back and watch the old I Spy television series, that guy's a fucking brilliant actor. 
[02:01:30]  Really?  I mean, that part's not really Bill Cosby.  It's like a cool, you know, secret agent guy.  Yeah, yeah.  It's fucking great.  God, I haven't seen those in years.  I mean, I tell you, I love Robert Culp, and I forgot about him and went back and watched him.  I think it's on Netflix or Apple TV.  And Cosby's great, man.  I've never seen the Eye Spies.  Oh, man, they're good.  They're good.  I never saw them.  They're funny, and they're a great TV show.  I think they won the Emmy a couple times, and Cosby won one or was nominated for one as a dramatic actor. 
[02:02:00]  What was he in Let's Do It Again?  And was he in Uptown Saturday Night 2 with Portier?  He was in both of them, right?  Yep.  Fuck.  That's a long career, man.  That's a Hall of Fame career right there.  But I mean, from the 60s.  That ain't no Spider-Man bullshit.  That's a real career.  You're calling it Spider-Man bullshit.  Yeah, but you know what I mean.  I mean, that's like when you talk about guys like him, he was around with Pryor and Carlin doing the Ed Sullivan show, and he's still working.  He just saw him at the Borgata.  Like, you're modest. 
[02:02:30]  That's a long haul.  You pop up in things where it's like, holy...  You don't even realize Dennis is in some stuff.  You're like, holy shit, that's right, the Sandlot.  That's right, Sandlot.  Jesus Christ.  Sandlot.  What a fucking loved movie that is.  I know.  That movie is just fucking like...  Everyone loves that movie.  Baseball, man.  Every kid watches it.  Baseball, just fucking...  Yeah, yeah.  That whole innocence thing, and just everybody kind of went through that shit as a kid.  But I have to say, you know what my favorite thing is, and I'm not bullshitting.  You know, Jim knows this.  Chris knows it, definitely.  My favorite thing is still to do is comics come home, because I get to... 
[02:03:00]  I'm raising money for charity, but...  Yeah, yeah.  For the Neely Foundation, but really, I get to see a bunch of guys that I love as the  host.  I have to introduce them and stand by the side of the stage in case, whenever they're  ready to come up, and I get to see like 10 great comics, work with my band, and it's  a huge gig.  Yeah.  So you're watching guys that you admire as comedians kill with like 8,000 people in  the room.  I love that gig.  A lot of people, yeah.  Because you don't get enough of that in show business.  There's always a camera.  There's always, you know, some kind of technical bullshit. 
[02:03:30]  Not in my career, there's not.  You were just on TV over the weekend, Jim.  It's me holding a camera pointy.  Can I record a few?  Why don't they televise it anymore?  Because years ago...  I used to love that.  We used to put it on Comedy Central, but the problem was is that the cameras always get  in the way, no matter...  I mean, it's slightly different now because the cameras are smaller.  So they always get in the way.  They make the live gig longer by a couple of hours.  And I found that when it wasn't televised, two things happened. 
[02:04:00]  One, of course, the gig itself becomes just a two, three-hour gig live.  And two, when people found out they could only see the show if they bought the tickets  to be in the room, we made more money for the charity.  And so every year we sell out, and it's built on the fact that if you're not in the room  that night, you don't see the show.  We may do something different for the 20th anniversary, which is next year, for a celebration.  But once we did that, when we got rid of television, it was... 
[02:04:30]  And the comedians...  The other thing is, I don't want the comedians to feel like, oh, I've got to sign off five  or ten minutes of my head.  I'm burning material.  Yeah, I want to burn material.  I want the comedians.  And I think the comedians love the fact.  They come in, they raise the money, the fucking crowd goes nuts, and you have a great time.  And guess what?  The material's protected.  Yeah.  What was the...  Who was on the first one that you guys did?  Oh, God.  John Stewart?  Yeah.  Stewart was there for the first couple...  I forget.  Everybody has done that show at one point or another.  Bill Cosby, Woody Allen.  It was a long time. 
[02:05:00]  I would love to get Cosby one year, man.  That would be wild.  Yeah.  You know?  How easy is it to do animations?  What do you mean?  Just doing the voices.  Is that the easiest gig in Hollywood?  It's the easiest gig.  Yes.  Let me tell you.  I'm doing it right now.  That's it.  This is it.  I have to stand up.  Okay, so it's a little harder.  You come in, you look like whatever the fuck you want to look like.  You go, okay.  And sometimes you just improvise.  On Ice Age, sometimes you just come in and improvise.  So you want me to just stand here and make up funny shit in the tiger voice and get paid a million dollars? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, I think I can do it.  All right.  I think I can do it.  I'm in.  Chris Rock did a funny bit on the Emmys or the Oscars or something this year.  Oh, right.  I laughed my balls off because I was like, that's the gig.  That's true, right?  That's it.  So talking to this thing?  All right, got it.  How many days work?  They're a little harder now because of the 3D because you have to, you can improvise to a certain point and then at a certain point it has to stop.  And with the 3D and the focus market stuff, they'll test it first and then you'll go in and play with some more stuff. 
[02:06:00]  Oh, they don't want to film the 3D stuff unless they know it's going to work.  Exactly.  Wow.  So it takes a little longer, but not much.  Wow.  Not much.  I'm not fucking around in Hollywood anymore.  No, no, no.  I heard Murphy can knock out a movie in a day.  They said Murphy can knock out an animation movie.  I wouldn't be surprised.  They said he's the master at doing those.  Wow.  One take, Eddie?  Yeah, like the Shrek show, whatever it is he does, he's just fucking good at that.  Well, you know what they do?  On Ice Age they do, and I'm sure they do on the Shrek ones. 
[02:06:30]  Like we start with Legu Zamo.  He comes in and improvs his way around the idea of what the movie's going to be.  Then they bring in me and Raider to react off of him.  And then they start to whittle it down.  Oh, wow.  So I'm sure on Shrek they just bring Eddie in and he goes crazy.  And they go, okay, that's great.  Let's bring the other guys.  He's a good improver, Legu Zamo.  I don't know much about him.  I've seen some of his one-man shows.  Guys, he's brilliant.  He's a talented actor.  I've had him on once.  He's a brilliant guy, man.  Oh, really?  If you've ever seen his one-man shows, they're just...  You weren't here that day? 
[02:07:00]  No, I was great.  Where were you?  I was probably on the road doing a gig or something.  His one-man shows are great.  I've seen a few of them.  Yeah, he's fantastic.  Talented guy.  Really good.  Ice Age is all due to him, man.  Ice Age 4.  We're the straight men for him.  Wow.  And there's not much of a script in the end?  No, they come in with a script, but John gets to take it...  To whatever he wants.  To whatever level he wants.  Who does he play?  I've never seen them.  Sid the Sloth.  Okay.  And that's the star of it, right?  Yeah, he's the main guy, the main comedy guy, and then we react around him.  Yeah.  It's me, him, and Ray Romano.  Right.  The first one, Ray was pretty much like the... 
[02:07:30]  It was the story.  It was pretty much about him, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, not anymore.  The woolly mammoth.  Not anymore.  We changed that.  Fuck that shit.  We changed that.  Jennifer Lopez is my love interest in this one.  Did you do scenes with her, or no, is all...  No.  I'm sure that's in a contract.  Yeah, I'll do it, but I'm not being in the same room as Larry ever.  Don't they have to have you guys together to ever have natural dialogue like we're having?  No, it depends on the schedule, you know?  You never saw her?  I didn't see her during this.  My schedule was insane.  Hers was insane.  I'm sure even if hers wasn't insane, she would not be in the same room with me. 
[02:08:00]  I actually do voiceovers for a living.  He does.  With cartoons, it's always individual.  Rarely do you get the whole cast together.  In the same room, yeah.  I heard they did get a better performance.  With that fantastic Mr. Fox movie, which was great.  They had everybody in somebody's backyard with microphones and recorded the whole cast  all at the same time doing the basic read-through.  Yeah, they did that with Rango, I guess.  Johnny Daly.  I didn't see Rango.  Yeah, they did that with him.  I didn't see it either, but I saw a little short documentary on it. 
[02:08:30]  I can't believe that us sitting around like this is actually a radio show.  I know, right?  The fuck is it?  It's been this way for 17, 18 years.  Hard to believe.  Way too long.  Since 94.  Wow.  Is it really?  Yeah, it's crazy.  In Spider-Man.  Oh.  No, I knew about it.  Well, of course you knew.  But I've got to say, it doesn't mean anything.  Why?  I don't know.  They told me that.  I'm like, guys, what do you mean?  They're like, listen, anything can happen.  Oh, right.  True.  So I had to sign up for everything. 
[02:09:00]  And I was like, listen, I'm totally open.  Whatever you guys want to do.  Yeah, yeah.  It's up to you.  I mean, I liked it.  Thanks, Hope.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't seen the movie yet.  Hey, you had a chance to go.  Fuck you.  He's actually blaming me for him giving me a spoiler before the movie even comes out.  But you had a chance to see the movie.  But I didn't have a chance.  I was.  Oh, you ruined it.  You fucking ruined it.  I was doing press.  I'm not going now.  You ruined it.  Oh, that's good. 
[02:09:30]  Two tickets ruined.  But if you weren't at the pool with your bullets.  Yeah, see?  See?  It could have gone.  We'll talk about that shit the next time.  My fault.  Are you guys on air all this week?  No.  No.  Just today, tomorrow.  And then off.  And no one else is working around here this week.  Yeah, this is ghost town.  It's a ghost town.  We should have taken a week off.  What are you doing for the fourth, Dazzler?  I'm actually going to be at home with my family, which is great.  I have four days off, and then I've got to go back on the road for press.  But yeah, four days of nothing.  Just pool.  What do you do?  Thinking about the bullets. 
[02:10:00]  Bullets.  Thinking about the bullets.  I make fun of you, but I totally love that.  Let's fire it into this and see if it goes through that and into that.  And into that.  Yeah.  I like to blow shit up.  Oh, I was going to ask.  You do your own fireworks at school?  I like to blow shit up.  Well, whenever I can.  My kids are grown up now, so if my kids want to blow shit up, I'm totally down with it.  I'm a bad dad that way.  I'm like, so you want to blow up that?  Yeah, let's blow it up.  Let's see what happens.  Remember the old days, though, with the menus of fireworks?  The guy used to give around.  I know, I know.  You know the guy at the deli or something. 
[02:10:30]  He's like, yeah, whatever you need.  You know, when we were kids, man, forget about shortage or do we have any.  There were always a million fireworks.  Forget the 4th of July.  They were just M80s were everywhere.  All the time.  Cherry bombs.  Ash can.  Ash can.  Ash can.  He blew up his grandmother's toilet with a cherry bomb one time.  I mean, who didn't do that?  Yeah.  We didn't even try to get them.  The toilet was always the victim in those things.  Yeah.  Awesome.  More toilets were blown up in the 70s.  We took out mailboxes in our day.  I love cherry bombs.  All the asshole in school. 
[02:11:00]  We would have to take out his mailbox for whatever reason.  I know.  You could tell things are different because, like, now, right now, we should be hearing  boom.  I know.  We should be blowing shit up in here right now.  We should be blowing shit up.  It's a war zone.  For weeks before and weeks after the 4th of July, you were hearing, like, fucking, it  sounded like a war zone.  And Dennis jokes.  He goes, we should be blowing up shit in here.  We used to, Dennis.  Oh, yeah.  What happened?  We used to do bottle rockets down the hall.  What happened?  Yeah, you know, management.  Lawyers.  Lawyers.  Fire.  They don't want to hear it.  You want to hear one of our greatest stunts ever? 
[02:11:30]  Yeah.  I loved that one.  We fired a bottle rocket out of a girl's pussy.  A girl's vagina as a rocket launcher.  We are the guys.  We've made a heat shield so it wouldn't burn her.  We spent all day figuring it out so no one would get logistics.  We fired right out of it and went down the hallway.  She's spreading.  And we put the stick down there.  What did it hit from the Yankees?  We had a Yankee cutout.  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I thought it was going to be a real guy.  That would have been awesome.  But that was our target.  I forgot who it was at the time.  Billy Martin.  Billy Martin.  It was Billy Martin.  So you guys killed Billy Martin. 
[02:12:00]  He had good hands.  And he couldn't drive that night.  We used to do a lot of things with vaginas, man.  We tried to get a cell phone to ring inside a girl.  Did that work?  To see if he could get a signal.  I don't remember.  I don't think so.  So it was like myth busters.  But it was old school cell phones.  That's true.  Yeah, it was the one that Michael Douglas had in the fucking Wall Street.  Walking down the beach.  Yeah, she was a big girl.  We had a girl smoke a cigarette from her vagina.  She blew smoke rings.  And we also, the best one ever, she used to do bachelor parties. 
[02:12:30]  She would throw eggs from her vagina.  Okay, I've seen that one.  It's pretty good.  It's a hip thing.  It's a hip thing.  It's pretty amazing.  We had a blind guy with a bunny ears on in a basket, catching him in the basket.  He was blind for some reason.  I hate when a pussy does anything like that.  I hate when a pussy does tricks.  It drives me fucking bonkers.  I hate it.  Now we just talk, Dennis.  Now we just talk.  Jimmy likes being the trick.  I certainly do.  Nothing better. 
[02:13:00]  Jimmy likes being the trick.  I really do.  What are the kids up to?  My kids aren't even kids anymore.  My son's 22.  My daughter's 20.  Wow.  My son just graduated from college, and that's daunting.  Holy shit.  Does he have any aspirations to comedy, the one that we're acting?  No, but they're both.  My son studied to be a film director, and so did my daughter.  She's still in school.  So I'm glad, because they're behind the camera, they're not in front of the camera.  And by the way, I got two great kids.  And I don't know how that happened, but I got two great kids who are incredibly sarcastic.  I know how that happened, and good kids, and fun. 
[02:13:30]  Good for you.  Yeah, that's the best thing, man.  And I'm young enough.  We hang out together, go to the same movies, have the relatively same taste in music.  And they endlessly break my balls.  They're just not impressed by me at all, and they just make fun of you all the time.  That's their job.  I know.  That's great.  That's how much you want, though.  You don't want kids who are in awe of you.  I know.  Because I can hire them.  My kids are my fans.  You can hire that shit.  And I will.  I'll get some kids and make them.  How tall is your son now?  And make them love me. 
[02:14:00]  6'6".  6'6".  I was amazed.  Wow.  He used to come around with you in the early days when he was still young, and I'm like,  he's already over 6'12".  You know how much money I could make if I signed him to a Celtics contract as the Scalabrini  guy on the bench who doesn't, the white guy who doesn't play, just comes out for like  four seconds at the end and fouls somebody?  That's like a $6 million contract right now.  6'6".  Wow.  I know.  Dennis is a big basketball fan.  I want a guy to tell you, we met Kareem Abdul-Jabbar finally.  He came in here.  We interviewed him.  Get out of here.  Really?  For what?  We were saying. 
[02:14:30]  His book on Black, it was a Black History Month book about black heroes and things like  this.  It was like a kid's book.  Oh, yeah?  And he had a publicist that was a real nightmare.  His publicist.  Why?  Talking about basketball.  We were talking about basketball.  How do you not talk about basketball?  Exactly.  She wanted us to focus on the book, which we, you know how this works.  Yeah.  If you have a good interview, people are going to see your project and we're going to get  to the book.  Yeah.  After the interview, because we talked way too much about basketball, we're looking out  this window.  She's yelling at him.  She's like, you're yelling at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? 
[02:15:00]  That's killing us.  I can't yell at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  Nobody yelled at Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.  And he looked at us like, help me.  And we're like, and we're trying to figure out what that relationship's about.  I've had, I think he's her only client or something.  It was sad, man.  But how was he?  He was cool.  He was very cool.  I met him once before when he was here.  He's a very skittish guy.  Like, he doesn't like signing things or taking pictures.  But he recognized me for an episode of Bored to Death I did.  Get out of here.  Really?  Yeah.  And I was like, I heard, like, people are like, he's difficult. 
[02:15:30]  He doesn't like doing photos.  But I'm like, I got to come in for Kareem.  He's one of my heroes.  So he walks out, and someone introduces us.  And he looks, and I'm like, ah, he knows me from somewhere.  And he goes, that show, you were on that show.  I'm like, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.  Even if I wasn't on the show, I would have said yes.  Mississippi Burning, yes.  That was me.  So we took the photo, and he didn't want to sign the ball.  He said, well, if you leave it with my assistant.  And the booker was so annoyed at the way his people were acting.  He's like, no, no, you got a second, Kareem.  You can do it.  But the booker actually got the ball, so he had Kareem sign my ball. 
[02:16:00]  Wow.  Yeah, we had Shaq in, so he was great.  Shaq was all right.  Yeah, Shaq's great.  And then we had Dr. J.  Yeah, Dr. J., who doesn't really acknowledge basketball in his own home.  He married a girl, or, yeah, from, where was she again?  Philippines or something.  That doesn't even understand basketball or anything.  So he walks around his own house, and no one gives a fuck that he's an NBA legend.  Do you guys remember when Larry Bird and Dr. J. fought and choked each other out?  Holy shit.  Yes, I know.  We were just talking about it the other day. 
[02:16:30]  When they finally went at it, the Sixers were playing the Celtics, and it got heated.  I think it was game six of that series back in 84, 82, I want to say.  I think it was 84.  And they literally came to blows.  Wow.  And they ended up grabbing each other.  Each guy had the other guy by the neck and was choking the guy out.  And it took them a while.  I remember McHale came in, and it took them two hits with his elbows to knock the arms away from each guy.  And then by the end, they were both saying, like, you know, we shouldn't have done that.  But they literally went after each other. 
[02:17:00]  Choking each other.  I love Dr. J., man.  Old school.  Dr. J.  He was the shit.  Michael Jordan.  You know, when LeBron got the MVP trophy during the NBA broadcast of that final game, I was ripshit.  When Bill Russell, okay, whose number LeBron is wearing, who not only is a, nobody is ever going to beat his record.  11 championships in 13 years.  Two of them as a player coach.  And also an active member of the civil rights movement in the 60s.  Hands him the trophy.  And what's his name? 
[02:17:30]  Stuart Scott doesn't even allow Bill Russell to talk.  Stuart Scott's too busy doing as cool as the other side of the pillow bullshit.  And Bill Russell hands a trophy to LeBron, and that's the end of Bill Russell.  I was like, you've got to be kidding me, man.  Wow.  That's Bill Russell.  11 championships, 13 years.  That's one of the greatest.  Nobody will ever break that.  Yeah, it's those two years, though.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Those shitty years.  I mean, what the fuck happened, Bill?  Those two years, yeah.  Yeah, what were you doing?  What was your concentration?  Fail.  Fail. 
[02:18:00]  How about this?  It looks like Dr. J. doesn't have a lot of money either, we learned.  Doesn't look like he doesn't.  What do you do with his money?  I don't know.  Some of these guys have bad investments or bad business managers.  His shirt looked a little off.  I'm like, oh.  But you know what?  Did Dr. J. come?  Was he a member?  Did he have those big contracts?  Not really.  No.  Maybe they were after him, right?  His last probably two years, right?  The Sixers, maybe?  When Larry was choking him, he was probably just making his big money.  Because he didn't get...  He was the ABA until they merged. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, man.  Yeah.  And then he was great.  But it was really...  Right when he retired is when Magic and Bird and Jordan started to hit those sneakers.  With the big numbers.  Boy, some of the old sports stars just got to think, fuck, man.  I know.  Dude, it's got to show us some crazy.  The lifelong payday.  I know.  I know.  You know, you look at guys like Yaz and Mickey Mantle when they were getting $100,000 a year  and they were the highest paid guys.  Yeah.  You look back on it.  I mean, part of them has to look back and go, like, that should have been $100,000,000. 
[02:19:00]  Millions, yeah.  Should have been $100,000,000.  Yeah.  And meanwhile, they're traveling around on shitty buses and...  And in Mickey Mantle's case, like, you know, like, that was Mickey Mantle playing in  New York.  And again, what did they win?  Eight World Series?  Yeah.  So, I mean, he would have been making, like, he would have been through the stratosphere  in terms of money.  It would have all gone, you know, up in place.  Probably would have been dead a lot earlier.  Yeah.  Mickey Mantle's place is closing, actually, at the restaurant.  That's right.  It's shutting down.  I never went there.  Sucks.  I was there once.  The worst sports story is Ted Williams, though, where he was signing autographs right to his 
[02:19:30]  last breath.  Yeah.  Holy fuck.  At least he's frozen.  Yeah.  His head is, anyway.  He's coming back.  There's a happy ending there.  We're going to be a happy ending.  And he's going to come back and hit 400 again and fly a, you know, a phantom jet and bomb  Iraq.  Flying in the water.  Ted Williams has flown into Iraq and bombed the country.  He's coming back.  It's amazing.  Those guys took off their fucking prime years.  I think DiMaggio lost years, too, right?  Yeah, they all did.  They lost three, four years, these guys, in the war. 
[02:20:00]  That's some dedication.  Listen.  What about Muhammad Ali?  I know.  Yeah.  Three prime years.  It is.  And Elvis.  Prime, prime.  Elvis.  What about the Elvis?  Elvis lost how many years to those bacon and 20, 25?  25 years in that house.  Maybe 30 years he lost.  Poor Dr. Nicopolis.  Yeah.  He just wanted to tell people he hung out with Elvis.  You don't get them for me, I'll buy the goddamn drugstore.  Right.  Right, Elvis.  He didn't want to get Elvis all those pills.  I mean, more than a fucking Conrad Murray wanted to drip propofol into his fucking meal 
[02:20:30]  ticket.  Exactly.  Right?  Would you not have given Elvis all the pills?  I would have given him the pills in a bacon and a peanut butter and fried sandwich.  That's what Elvis said to him.  He said, if you don't give it to me, I'll buy the goddamn drugstore.  That's right.  He would have.  Yeah.  That's a tough call for a doctor, man.  Not really.  You know better.  Not really.  Not for me.  Dr. Dennis Leary.  Okay, Elvis, here we go.  Oh, yeah.  I'll buy it for you.  Hang on.  Why should you drive all the way down to the drugstore and buy it?  I'll buy it for you.  I'll be right back.  Dr. Nick was the face of evil after Elvis died. 
[02:21:00]  Like, Dr. Nick, man, you couldn't stop.  Every time there was a special on Elvis.  Yeah, but it's like the Whitney Houston thing, man.  It's like, put your finger pointed at Bobby Brown.  A junkie's a junkie, man.  And that's it.  Elvis was a junkie.  And by the way, if you want to hang around with him and you're Dr. Nick, go get the drugs.  I want to hang out with Elvis, right?  That's what it's about.  Propofol, what do you need?  You want Propofol?  I'll get it for you.  You'd think doctors would be a little more ethical than just to do this, to hang out with  They're doctors like, I'm a doctor.  Oh, is that it?  I'm a celebrity doctor.  Dr. Dennis Leary.  I got a celebrity degree. 
[02:21:30]  Dr. Nick, same thing.  Come on.  Dr. Dennis Leary.  Listen, when Michael Jackson went, I need a doctor who can almost make me die every  night instead of sleeping and go on tour with me.  How many doctors are like, oh yeah, I'm ready.  It's kind of the semi-doctor.  He was a bad sleeper.  Nothing would work for him.  I almost felt bad for him when I heard, because I'm an insomniac, and he would have rehearsal  and just be laying there until 10 in the morning going, I can't fucking sleep.  What do you do?  Me?  I just, I'm just a tortured, terrible sleeper, man.  But what do you take? 
[02:22:00]  Nothing.  I can't take any narcotics.  I'm an addict, so I'll take nothing.  I mean, occasionally...  What about NyQuil?  No, it's got alcohol.  I'm an alcoholic.  I can't do it.  Meditate.  Yeah.  Maybe I should find some pieces.  But I jerk off, I notice, when I have the computer.  It makes me more awake.  Really?  Yeah, man.  That does something to you.  Usually you get rid of...  But that's the oldest theory in the book.  Yeah, you get rid of...  It knocked you out.  It's not true?  You knocked one out.  Not for me.  I seem good.  I want to fucking paint the living room after I blow a wall.  It's horrendous.  Even though one wall's already gone. 
[02:22:30]  By the way, what color is the living room right now?  White peach.  It's a stucco.  Tomorrow is puce.  Stucco.  That's what women do.  Women get the energy.  I know.  I know.  All right.  All right.  How are we doing on time?  We're doing great.  It's up to you.  Dennis, are we going to play this song?  We played it.  We can play it again, though.  Let's play it again.  At the end of your appearance?  Yeah.  What do you know about Larry Bird?  What do I know about him?  Yeah, man.  Is he a heavy drinker?  He's not on the record.  I don't know anything about him. 
[02:23:00]  You don't know anything?  I've never met him.  I love him.  I've heard rumors about him.  I'm just curious.  Would you want to meet him?  Oh, yeah.  I'd love to meet Larry Bird.  He looks miserable.  Yeah, well, he's running the pacers.  How would you be?  Well, during the playoffs, he just sat there.  He looked miserable.  Yeah.  How is Magic Johnson so much healthier looking than Larry Bird?  I don't know.  That's fucked up.  I don't know.  That's fucked up.  I don't know.  It's magic.  I don't have an answer for that.  Yeah, that's magic.  It's magic.  It's been one of the great mysteries of life for the past 20 years.  Do you think younger players are nice to Magic and Bird when they meet them? 
[02:23:30]  They better be.  They better be, man.  Because I'll tell you what.  That's where you're...  If you think about the way we were just talking about it, you better be nice to Jordan, Bird,  and Magic.  And I hope those guys are really fucking nice to Bill Russell and that generation of people.  I doubt they are, though.  I hope so.  Oh, I'm sure they are.  They probably have respect for that.  Maybe polite, but I don't know.  Who's your top five?  Basketball.  Top five basketball?  You're not going to like the list.  That's why I want to ask.  All right.  It's totally biased.  It's a lot of Celtics. 
[02:24:00]  It's my top five.  Bill Russell.  I've got to put Dr. J in there.  You've got to put Larry Bird.  And then Larry Bird.  Jordan, you have to put it in there.  Oh, boy.  Your top five list is like everyone else.  KG.  Rondo.  I'm just total Celtic bias after Dr. J.  I can't help it.  I can't help it.  But Bill Russell, I think...  Rondo's amazing.  Bill Russell all the time has to be...  And I'm not just because I'm a Celtics fan.  11 and 13 years, beat it.  Just go ahead and beat it. 
[02:24:30]  You know?  He doesn't get enough respect in my book, you know?  No, he doesn't.  You don't hear...  I think...  Didn't Chamberlain play at that time?  Chamberlain played at the same time.  And, you know, Bill, one of the...  If you read any of the Bill Russell books, he never really admits this.  But other people write about it.  He used to be...  He was friends with Wilt.  And before they played, even during the regular season, when they were playing wherever Wilt  was playing, or in Boston, he would have dinner with Wilt, and he was nice and just loved  Wilt and black, because he knew Wilt was a little bit afraid of playing all out, because 
[02:25:00]  he was afraid he'd hurt people.  But against the Celtics, he might play all out, except Bill was so nice to him, and  he liked Bill so much, he took a little bit off his game.  Oh, really?  So, Bill Russell said years later, I gotta admit, part of it was I knew he would play  less hard if he thought I was his close friend.  Wow.  So, psychologically, I go like, Bill Russell was the greatest.  That's good, yeah.  I mean, that is sick.  That is sick.  They were all scared of Wilt, huh?  Yeah.  What was strong, man?  This big guy.  Yeah.  You know?  He was like... 
[02:25:30]  But think about that.  We're friends.  We're gonna play street hockey tomorrow in a tournament, right?  I go, let me take you out to dinner and have a great time.  You laugh, laugh, laugh, and in the morning, you even go, hey, man, how you feeling and  everything?  So, we get out there, you're not gonna hit me as hard from behind as you would, because  I'm your friend.  That's smart.  That's what he was doing.  That's so cool.  I know.  That's sick.  How tall is Bill Russell?  Is he 6'6", 6'9"?  He's pretty big, man.  He was one of the first big men.  I think he's 6'10".  Is he?  Yeah.  And he was a...  Which was tall.  He was a defensive, dominant guy, which he also doesn't get enough credit for. 
[02:26:00]  He sacrificed points because he had Cousy to begin with, to pass to, and he just  went for rebounds and played strong defense, which is another reason he beat Wilt.  His theory was, let Wilt score 50 points in the first half, because his team will then  keep passing it to him in the second half, and during the second half, I shut Wilt down.  And he never thinks to pass the ball away, because his teammates aren't ready for a pass,  because they're like, you got another 50, right?  So, I mean, it's just psychologically, the way Bill Russell beat those guys is just fantastic. 
[02:26:30]  You know?  Who else did Wilt have on his team?  Nobody, really.  I mean, it's like that famous...  In the early age...  Adam Sandler does that famous impression of all Wilt Chamberlain's teammates during  the 100-point game, their timeout.  Hey, Wilt, I'm open.  Wilt, I'm open.  I'm open, too.  Come on, man.  That record will never be broke.  No.  Just because they sit the players now, too.  They sit them down if it's a blowout, right.  I get frustrated when they sit a guy that's having one of those crazy nights, but the score's  out of hand.  Pass the ball, man.  But is there anybody as dominant as Wilt was? 
[02:27:00]  I mean, like, even LeBron is great or Kobe.  No, not even close.  Never will be.  Not even close.  Because, you know, him and Russell were the first...  You know, they weren't the first tall men, but they were the first truly, you know,  dominant tall men that, you know, that changed the game.  And at that point, like, your average guy was in the NBA.  It was like 6'2", 6'1", you know?  So, they were really...  They'll never dominate that way again.  You'd have to have a guy that came in that was 8'5 and could play.  Is that the best photo ever?  I'm showing my Kareem picture.  It's the picture of me and Kareem. 
[02:27:30]  Oh, yeah, I'll miss it.  How fucking...  That's awesome.  You realize what a big man he is when a...  How old is Kareem now?  He's got to be...  60...  Wow.  I'm going to say...  I'm 43.  He's probably 65.  Early 66.  He's just like a ventriloquist.  Had one of the...  That would be a great act.  You and Kareem, a ventriloquist act?  Actually, Kareem and Kevin Hart would be better.  Oh, shit.  Kareem just turned 65, I guess.  Did he really?  Wow.  In April.  He still looks great. 
[02:28:00]  There's a little gray in the mustache.  And, you know, he was going bald in the 87 when he played.  Yeah.  But he looks really healthy, man.  Like, I guess as an athlete, he's stayed healthy as a martial artist or whatever.  But he fucking looks great.  Jesus.  Can you imagine getting kicked in the face by him from a block away?  There's Kareem all the way.  The leverage he could get on that leg.  Like, he was all clumsy in Game of Death.  Like, you know...  Yeah, yeah.  He's still a good...  I'm sure he was great in Airplane.  I love him.  Yeah.  Oh, my God.  Classic. 
[02:28:30]  I love that boy to this day.  A classic role right there.  Absolutely.  I love when he yells at the kid.  Yeah.  Yeah, you try dragging Walton and Lanier down the court.  Tell your old man.  Bob Lanier.  Oh, God.  We should get you guys out of here.  You're doing more press there, Dennis.  We are going to do Jim Brewer's show.  Ah!  I haven't seen Jim since the last time he was at CCH.  Is he in here or is he doing ISDN?  I have no idea.  I don't even know what ISDN means.  Brewer's here and he didn't stop in to say hi. 
[02:29:00]  Get out of here.  Well, fuck, he better come over here.  We're cross-promoting Brewer on your show?  Yeah, we are.  Wow.  We go way back to Jim Brewer.  That is technology.  I like Jim Brewer.  Are you going to travel the world doing press for this movie, Spider-Man?  Yes, I have been already.  We're a month in, and now I've got another 10 days left after this weekend.  And I've got to promote Ice Age, too.  Ice Age 4 next week.  They don't pay you to do the movie.  They pay you to promote the movie.  And kiss my ass.  And don't forget, kiss my ass.  iTunes as of today.  Brewer, what the fuck?  You don't say hi.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[02:29:30]  Hi, Jim Brewer.  What's up, Dennis?  How are you?  What's going on?  You don't say hi anymore.  I'm going to come in.  I'm going to step on this shit.  Brewer.  Let me come in.  I know he's promoting a big blockbuster movie, but let me come in and talk about my gig.  Tarrytown.  Yeah.  Next Saturday.  Yeah.  What the fuck am I going to do?  How about you do your interview now?  Hey, listen.  I know he's got the big Spider-Man thing.  Ice Age.  $50 billion.  Listen, Tarrytown.  Next week, filming my new special. 
[02:30:00]  There's still 500 seats left.  If you order today, you may get a discount.  Now listen, Jim.  Jim.  What time and what day really is the Tarrytown gig?  It is July 14th where I film my new special.  Or you can go see Spider-Man and Ice Age.  The beautiful thing about it is you knew he was really sneaking a plug-in.  That's the beauty of the comic book.  I know.  It's nice.  And download the new song. 
[02:30:30]  Jim Brewer in Tarrytown.  July 14th.  What time is that show?  It's an 8 p.m. show.  8 p.m. show.  It's a one-hour show.  Who else is on the show with you?  It's my new one-hour special.  Oh, wow.  What's it called?  Just you.  It's called Midlife Madness.  Really?  Yes.  Are you doing the stuff I saw you doing?  How old are you now?  45.  Fuck, man.  We are fucking old.  Jesus Christ.  We're all old.  You used to be the really young guy.  He was the kid.  Or one of the really young guys.  And now you're 45.  It's true.  How many kids do you get? 
[02:31:00]  Three girls.  Three girls.  Those is 13.  I got a little kid hanging around the house now.  Oh, man.  I can't believe how old you are.  I'm less sure.  I do, but I can't say that because I don't know if my neighbors listen.  Yeah, you can't do that.  You can't say that.  I think the kid, I'm pretty sure.  Yeah, there's something going on.  He just doesn't know yet.  He can't help your wife decorate.  Oh, shit.  Oh, yeah.  No, you're good.  You're good.  It's a good problem to have.  He's like, Mr. Brewer, your new shades match your walls.  What 12-year-old child says that? 
[02:31:30]  Knows that shit.  None.  One that wants to fucking keep coming to the house without the father thinking anything.  He goes, I want to know I'm not overwhelming my stay.  Am I still okay?  If I could use your pool?  Yeah, you can do.  He wears a college shirt.  Wow.  I'm all right.  No, you're good.  You're good.  You're good.  I feel confident.  Yeah, no, you're all right.  She's 13 and she looks like, what, 18?  She looks like she's 18.  Well, maybe he's really smart.  And maybe he's throwing the fucking side game at you. 
[02:32:00]  That's what I'm saying.  Good, huh?  Hey, he's pulling up Bill Russell.  He's pulling up Bill Russell on him.  Yeah, yeah.  He's doing that shit.  He may be doing that.  That could be.  Imagine that.  He's like, hey, listen, I'm going to make your dad think I'm gay.  Yeah.  So he has no idea how deep we're going in this relationship.  Oh, man.  Because even now, when he talks to her, he stands really close, but he frails with his  wrist, but he'll touch her arm and stuff.  Oh.  But she doesn't give an ounce.  She doesn't give an ounce. 
[02:32:30]  She doesn't give.  Have you spoken to her about how far the relationship's going?  And then she shuts it down instantly.  She's like, no.  Yeah.  No.  No.  Which she has clearly showed who she's liked.  See, but she's a smart cat, too.  I don't know if she's playing with my emotions, either.  Oh, look at you.  You've got to fucking try to figure all this shit out.  Dude, I'm going to start translating transvestites just to keep boys away for the next eight years.  I'd hang out with you more.  That's the only thing I'll keep chicks away.  Yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  Yeah, you would.  You may even be able to buy me.  Man, the fucking mind games that are going on. 
[02:33:00]  You've got to figure out if they're bullshitting you about their sexuality.  I know how to change it.  I'll bring them to the movie Spider-Man.  Let them sit in the back.  And then I'll see what's going on.  That's what the kids do now, too.  They sit in the back of the movie.  They want to get dropped off the movie theater.  Oh, shit.  That's what goes on in my town.  I've got a lockdown in my town.  Dropped off the movie theater and they sit in the back?  And they pretend they're seeing the movie.  They wait until you turn the corner and they go, suck bass and this and that.  This and that. 
[02:33:30]  Yeah.  Dude, it's a nightmare.  I love that he's saying this like this is a brand new thing.  To me, it is.  This is what we used to do.  That is true.  I remember a fingering girl during Friday the 13th.  During the Defiant one, some guy got blown.  That is Defiant.  It really is.  Oh, my God.  I wasn't in that world for years, though.  I was playing stickball until it was 15, 16.  Yeah.  Same hockey.  No chicks, though? 
[02:34:00]  Come on.  I would show off with the chicks, but I wasn't.  Yeah, you weren't.  It wasn't happening, right?  No.  That was all that there was.  With 14-year-olds.  That was all we wanted, though.  Yes.  Like my crowd of guys that I hung out with, it was just.  That's all any of us wanted.  We just didn't get it.  And of course, you knew every girl wanted a fucking 69 Nova full of degenerates.  Right.  You got any friends?  Right.  It's the last thing they wanted.  That 69 Nova.  Now that's.  You know how much that car's worth now?  I know.  It's fucking crazy.  Not after I was done with it.  Jesus Christ.  The Plymouth Duster.  Remember those?  The Plymouth Duster. 
[02:34:30]  That was a great one.  My brother had a Duster.  It's going to Duster tonight.  Fucking A.  I had a Nova.  Chevy Nova.  73 Nova.  Hit the gas, faggot.  That's three weeks.  What are you doing?  Hit the gas.  Get big fucking cars in the back, faggot.  Get the J.C. Whitney catalog and fucking get some good shit for it.  That thing loaded down in the back of, where was it?  Green Acres Mall.  It was the only white guy who ran for my life.  Green Acres Mall.  What the hell is that?  Long Island.  Valley Stream.  Oh, Jesus.  Valley Stream.  Oh.  Yeah. 
[02:35:00]  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  South Shore trash.  I love it.  South Shore?  Why trash?  South Shore is trash.  We ruled the Long Island.  The fucking expressway is like the Mason Dixon line of fucking Long Island.  It really was.  You stay over there, I'll stay over here.  You stay over here.  What would Carl think?  What?  What would Carl think?  Oh, Carl.  Wow.  I can't believe you brought Carl up.  My favorite.  My favorite person living or imagined.  I knew he would be.  Who's Carl?  I don't remember Carl.  You guys just, he knows why it's coming down the street. 
[02:35:30]  Hey, listen.  The jungle's back the other way there.  Hey, you're out of your neighborhood.  There's no fruits in these trees, if you know what I'm saying.  Yeah, it was one of those.  Meanwhile, that was my dad.  He's drinking the lawn.  Hey, the jungle's back that way, LeBron.  There's no one to mug here.  We're all watching each other.  Head back to the...  Holy shit. 
[02:36:00]  Hey, did you ever do more of that documentary?  What?  Did you ever do more of that documentary?  No, but I think I'm going to...  You should, dude.  You should, man.  Well, I've been thinking about it, and I think I may do it in the fall.  I almost called you once from a lobby.  I was just thinking of you like, fucking, would you keep filming?  You got more there.  No, you're right.  I'm going to film in the fall.  What's the documentary?  Him and His Own Land.  What is it?  I took my dad until he was 84, 85 at the time.  Bro, I'm on the...  He's a World War II vet.  Never talks about shit.  Right, of course.  Just talks about chick. 
[02:36:30]  If you ask him, hey, what was the war like?  He goes, Australia was fantastic.  Had us on leave for two weeks.  That's all he'll go.  So it really was about...  I know he's not going to be living much longer.  He's starting to get senile.  Great idea.  I brought him on the road.  It was touching.  It was sad.  It was a little disturbing at times.  It's really good.  It is.  It's a really good movie.  I fucking love it. 
[02:37:00]  From what I saw, I've ever done this.  That's right up my alley.  But the conclusion should be...  There's more information now.  I think he should film more with his dad now.  Yes.  He's getting worse.  See if he can talk about the war.  Maybe you can get him to talk about it.  You know what?  They won't.  They won't.  They won't.  You see in the documentary, I ask him a million times.  But that's okay.  I mean, that would be interesting to watch you try to make him talk about it.  Not that you'd watch it.  I would watch it.  I probe him literally every...  We'll go to dinner, and I'll go,  So what was the worst place? 
[02:37:30]  And he'll go,  What the fuck do you want to know?  And I say,  Which island's the worst?  He goes,  They were all worse.  Hey, look at that hot ass.  Oh, shit.  Yeah, he doesn't want to.  Just to flex.  Yeah.  Yeah.  He deflects.  But you know what?  Shit, I have Alzheimer's now.  Like, dementia.  I was going to ask you something when you were...  Oh, so does he mind the cameras when you're shooting him?  No, he's a ham and scene stealer.  Oh, okay.  Like, we're in...  What's great is because he's older.  So we're in a diner. 
[02:38:00]  And the chick comes up.  And I had to edit a lot.  I mean, he drops C words.  He's really...  Are you ever in a...  We've got to keep those in.  I had to edit.  Oh, that's great.  Go on.  Were you ever embarrassed?  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  Like, the one place we were at,  we're in the diner,  and she comes up,  and he's going,  You know, he's a fag, right?  And then she'd walk away.  She's like,  She didn't get it.  And then I go, 
[02:38:30]  Oh, God.  I didn't get it.  And then...  Like, there's something to get  just by pointing at someone  and saying,  I need some fag.  I need some fag.  Oh, I get it.  He must be a fag.  I get it.  She didn't get it.  You would...  The best thing about him,  I used to introduce him  to stars.  Like, whenever it started.  And by far the best ever.  Now, this is years ago.  This is Paul Abdul.  Just to explain my dad.  I go to the bathroom.  We're finishing the SNL party.  I go to the bathroom.  And the party's 5,000 people there, 
[02:39:00]  and you're kissing.  Hey, you're great.  Hey, you're great.  Let's do things together.  I come back.  Let's do things together.  Do they say that at the parties?  Oh, my God.  Every single one.  Yeah, no, keep in touch.  I'm still looking for a job.  Yeah.  I come back,  and Paul Abdul is with him,  laughing.  Ah, ha, ha, ha.  He's naughty.  Oh, no.  Yeah, now I already know  some of the things he's been laid out. 
[02:39:30]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Something transpired.  He goes like this, which to me is still  the greatest thing I've ever heard in my life.  He goes,  Paula, you like playing puppy?  She goes,  ha, ha, ha, ha.  And hookah, I say,  what's puppy?  That's when I sniff your ass  and you just growl.  Ha, ha, ha, ha.  Oh, my God.  That's like in his eight?  Oh, yeah.  He's fucking, yeah.  Oh, wow.  And she's like,  ha, ha, ha, ha.  Okay.  I'm going to take him home.  Now you think about your dad.  Now you think about your dad  and what he was like 
[02:40:00]  on the two weeks leave in Australia  that he talks about  being the greatest two weeks of his life.  How insane was that trip?  After it took out a week-long shower  to take the Japanese blood off his body.  Yeah, right.  That you know he saw.  They just strung Mussolini up  and killed, you know, him  and then went to Australia  to drink and get laid for two weeks.  What were they saying that?  Oh.  Holy shit.  I can only imagine what they were.  And they were conquering heroes.  That's right.  They were huge heroes.  And those guys wear those hats. 
[02:40:30]  I always go up to any vet with a hat  because they want you to go,  Hey, man, nice, nice.  All right, yeah, yeah.  Nice fucking hat.  They're wearing the hat.  Thank you so much.  Oh, yeah.  I think last time I was here, right,  he was getting a hat.  I went up to him and shot bright.  I said, World War II vet.  Thank you very much.  And he goes,  Three years, eight months, 22 days.  1942, blah, blah, blah.  We bought it.  Oh, he rattles it off.  He just rattled the whole thing off. 
[02:41:00]  Wow.  Because they want it  because they know it's over.  Jap bodies up to my knees  as we storm that beach.  I have a flamethrower.  Germans coming at me from the sky.  Japanese coming at me from the ground.  We'd set them on fire  so we wouldn't waste bullets.  Right.  Jesus.  Shit that we will never, ever do in our lives.  I can't comprehend it.  Shit.  You know, Derny was on Rescue Me.  And he was, he was,  he was landed at Normandy  and he was in the Battle of the Bulge.  Jesus.  He's got one half of it.  I think it's his right leg  is still black from the frostbite 
[02:41:30]  from one of the battles.  And he's got,  he's got a mark in his chest  that looks like  somebody took a claw hammer  and dug it into his chest  is from when he was  killing a Nazi guy  and the guy's hand was clawing  as he was crushing the guy's face  with a rock.  Charles Durning?  Charles Durning, right?  Wow.  Face to face  and he's got a reminder like that.  But he never talked about it.  He would never talk about it.  And I couldn't get him to talk about it.  I wrote some,  I'd write stuff into the scripts  and he would say it  but he would never talk about it, right?  Right. 
[02:42:00]  So then I went to do the Memorial Day thing  one weekend, you know,  when they were on the troops on PBS  with Joe Montaigne and Sinise  in Washington  and he was getting honored that year.  And when I saw him backstage  when he was waiting to be introduced  and I saw Colin Powell  and the heads of all four military  who were about, you know,  to go on stage  walk up individually,  he was sitting down  and shake his hand  and talk to him.  I went, wow.  All right.  He did something.  Yeah, he did something.  You know?  I got, yeah. 
[02:42:30]  Unbelievable.  Those guys didn't talk.  It's weird.  We never talk about it.  They say that a lot of them  wish they had therapy and stuff  because it was healthier  but they fucking ghost guys  just didn't talk about that stuff.  I asked Durning about therapy  and this is a famous showbiz story.  I'd heard that he once held  a William Morris agent  outside the window  who didn't pay him  upside down  like 15, 20 stories in the air.  Should night.  Right?  Yeah.  So I asked him one time  I said,  is it true that story  about you holding  the William Morris agent  upside down  like 20 stories in the air? 
[02:43:00]  He goes,  it was 15 stories  and yeah,  that was my therapy  after the war.  And I was like,  holy shit.  Wow.  Well, that's,  I also,  this,  I started learning  about my dad  by the,  by the town bully  and there was,  they were the Delapines  and,  and when you grew up  and anyone that was in jail,  you're like,  holy shit,  fucking Delapines  are in jail.  Don't fuck with the Delapines.  Kids stole my bike  and all that shit.  It was eight of them.  Three of them  were armed robbery, 
[02:43:30]  thrown in jail,  but they were out.  So,  cut to,  I'm 12 years old  and this is,  this is when I realized  like my dad's,  there's something  fucking off with my dad.  My dad is,  he's a little guy,  he's smaller than me.  The main Delapine  is on my front porch.  He rings the bell.  My dad's already  passed out  from the fucking beer.  My mom's marked  three martinis in.  That was the routine.  And your dad's beer  is fucking Sue Simmons.  He's out.  Sue Simmons. 
[02:44:00]  He went local.  I got monkeys.  All monkeys.  All monkeys.  Let's guess who did that.  Monkeys.  I don't know.  Oh my God.  Stay out of the seats.  Stay out of the,  oh my God.  Oh shit.  They're out.  They're out called.  Wow.  The door rings,  Delapines,  at the front door.  I actually have a heart attack.  I'm so scared,  I almost start crying. 
[02:44:30]  And he goes,  he's looking right past me,  he goes,  we want to talk to your father.  And I went,  my father's sleeping.  And I look out,  I swear on my children's lives,  there's three of them  on my porch  and there's two  standing in my walkway  and more outside their car  leaning against the car.  And I go,  my,  my dad's sleeping.  I feel a claw  grab me,  pull me aside  and he,  my father walks out  on the patio  and he goes,  what is that?  Fucking, 
[02:45:00]  one,  two,  three,  four,  five,  seven,  how many car?  Yeah,  three,  seven of you  for one little old man.  He goes,  you may get the best of me,  but one of you  are going to fucking die.  Which one's it going to be?  Is it going to be you?  Is it going to be you?  Which one of you  fucks are going to die tonight?  Because you're going to watch  one of you fuckers die.  And my mom's like,  Jesus Christ,  you're in the goddamn house  and we're going to cops 
[02:45:30]  and his son's a cop.  And the whole fucking deli,  now the oldest brother's going,  we're just,  we're just,  you hit a chain.  You hit my little brother  with a chain.  And he takes out  of his back pocket  the dog leash,  which we had a poodle.  Oh.  A little poodle.  And he's like,  this is what you're worried about?  He goes,  again,  you got five seconds  because I want to get it on.  Who's going to die?  And they were like,  oh,  we're really apologizing. 
[02:46:00]  You fucking mean it.  And they left.  And that was a defining moment  the rest of my life.  I just,  I looked at my dad like,  were you fucking crazy?  Do you know they have guns?  He didn't give up.  He didn't care.  Guns?  See,  I would have loved  to have one of the Delapines  die in that story.  Right?  Yeah.  Right?  From a death blow to the neck  as your father throws a warning shot.  Watch this.  The boy coming out 
[02:46:30]  of every hole in his head.  He just hits the fucking neck.  What does he give a fuck?  He was in World War II?  He doesn't give a fuck  about the Delapines?  Fuck you.  That's when I realized.  I love your dad.  I do too.  I haven't even met him  and I love him.  I can't wait to see  this fucking documentary.  That is great.  It really is good, Dennis.  You're going to love it, man.  It really is good.  A lot more people  should be seeing this damn thing.  You'll fucking love it.  It's hot, man.  How long is it?  It's an hour.  I'll make it longer.  You told me  and you really made me  think about it  and I'm definitely  going to do it.  Now I've got a nurse 
[02:47:00]  so you've got to clean.  He wears diapers and shit.  On that trip,  he shit three times.  Oh, man.  That's a rough thing  to clean up.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  It's fun to do for a film.  You should film more  if you can, though.  I am.  I am.  I just booked  a whole fall tour.  I want to get a bus  and just film  the shit out of him  because he's still funny.  Yeah, he fucking sounds it, man.  He's dying.  The ambulance  comes over the house.  He looks like he's dying. 
[02:47:30]  Right?  Everything out of his mouth  is always funny.  He always tries to be funny  no matter what.  They go,  Mr. Brewer,  you okay?  You okay?  You're in pain?  He goes,  yeah, I'm in pain.  Where's it her?  He goes,  I'm pregnant.  I'm pregnant.  I don't know  who the father is  and I wouldn't tell you  because then you'd start rumors.  Oh, my God.  While he's drooling  and his head's a twitching.  Can you imagine  what he was like in the war?  Oh, man. 
[02:48:00]  He literally was like  that guy from Die Hard  doing fucking one-liner,  wise-ass one-liners  while he was killing people.  Non-stop.  He must have been  a fucking blast  to hang out with in the war.  Well, you know what's funny?  Oh, man.  I would say so  because as I grew up,  he was just a dad  and it was my college year  where kids would go,  you're a brewer  because he's a lot older.  Everyone thinks  he's a grandfather.  They go,  your father?  Does he drive a garbage truck?  I go, yeah.  Oh, my God.  I had your father for this.  He's the funniest fucking guy 
[02:48:30]  I ever met in my life.  I'm like,  my dad is?  Yeah.  Funniest fucking guy.  And as I got older,  I mean,  he started fights at town halls.  He was.  Wow.  What a hero.  He was the clown of clowns.  What a hero.  But I didn't realize that  as I got older.  So that's another reason  I made the documentary.  You never had any war buddies  come over or anything like that?  They all worked together.  They all,  they all,  it was really sad.  They all worked together  at the sanitation place. 
[02:49:00]  They all got each other jobs.  And one,  two of his best friends  died of a heart attack.  They were all heavy fucking drinkers.  Yeah.  Can you blame them?  No.  One,  and one hung himself  and one shot himself.  Jesus Christ.  My dad was the only one.  Wow.  My dad was the only one  That's hardcore, man.  That's a group.  Yeah.  That's crazy right there.  But that makes sense,  doesn't it?  When you think about it?  Oh, man.  What they must have been through.  You can't even fucking fathom.  But he never,  and what I thought was amazing, 
[02:49:30]  which I brought out in the doc,  is that he never put all that on me.  Right.  He was just a dad.  Right.  Right.  He was there at the games.  He was there at the thing.  He never was like,  oh, you fucking idiot.  Even when I had my dangling cross-earing  and Judas Priest on the bag  like,  fucking Judas Priest, dad.  And singing her thing.  Yeah.  He's like,  That's great.  That's great.  That's great music.  Never.  Kept it inside. 
[02:50:00]  Can you imagine what he would have said?  No, can you imagine?  Oh, my God.  You gotta love him for that shit.  He's fucking A.  What a guy.  What a guy.  Yeah, he could have been that,  I defended country for this shit.  Yeah, isn't it what I defend him?  Either wear your faggot earring  and fucking...  How's your mom doing?  I just love that he was out cold.  Just that story about the Della Pines  where he's out cold  after Sue Simmons.  But as soon as his son...  As soon as there's a whiff of trouble  for his son,  not only is he wide awake, 
[02:50:30]  he's moved the son out of the way  and has taken on 15 Della Pines  and doesn't give a fuck  because at least...  I mean, you gotta...  That's a dad.  That's a dad.  Fuck you.  That's a dad.  I love that.  There's like two or three  of those incidents  that I'll remember forever and ever.  Fucking great, bro.  Fucking animal.  Yeah.  Really?  Five...  Ten brothers and sisters,  five...  Just the opposite of band of brothers.  All five went to the war.  All five came back.  Wow.  One was shot down in Germany. 
[02:51:00]  One was a prisoner of war.  I know.  Wow.  The old one came back.  My Uncle Jerry came to this country  and was here  and to get his citizenship  had to join the army.  So he went to Korea and fought.  Again, came back  and he was fucked up  and was trapped.  He always acted like  he had a great time,  like it was the easiest thing  in the world.  But when he died  and the guys that he served with  came to his funeral,  this is like two years ago,  we started hearing all this shit about,  oh yeah, no,  we used to, you know,  we used to be afraid of him  because he was so fucking crazy  and they showed us pictures.  We're looking at pictures of him  on the front 
[02:51:30]  and we're going,  he fucking told us  he was like back,  you know, behind the seat.  Had a motor pool.  Yeah, never said anything.  You know, it was like,  just they fucking locked it up.  They locked it up.  Threw it away.  Throw it away.  Whiskey.  Wow.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Whiskey.  Smoke, smoke, smoke.  Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.  Whiskey, whiskey, smoke, smoke.  Right?  Meanwhile, you're going like,  you know,  you're thinking,  everything's fine with him.  Now when he dies,  you go,  fucking guy was crazy.  Right?  Right.  Thank God he didn't kill you.  Right?  Thank fucking God. 
[02:52:00]  When I think about  how scary our dads were,  you know,  about like when we fucked up,  when they,  I don't know if your dad  ever threw a shot at you.  Oh man.  Never threw a shot at you.  My dad threw a shot at my older brother  who challenged him once,  Kiwi.  Kiwi was my,  he came home drunk  after a fight.  My uncle Danny  was a police officer.  I was called him,  he's fucking in a fight  with a bunch of guys  with shovels.  My dad was like,  that cock sucker.  And he came home  and he walked in the front door.  He was already drunk  and he went to the refrigerator  and he opened it up  and he grabbed a beer  and my old man went,  you crack open that beer  or I'll knock you out  with one fucking punch.  And my brother was huge. 
[02:52:30]  You know,  he's bigger than my dad.  And he cracked the beer  and I'll never forget it.  He hit him  and he was like slow motion.  He went backwards  and his head hit the linoleum.  He was already out.  So hard.  My mother went,  you killed him.  And my old man,  he hit him  and he walked away  and lit up a cigarette  like I told him  I was going to fucking hit him.  Right?  This is my...  When you think about  what's really in their heads  from World War II.  Right.  No.  Crazy.  It is pretty wild.  It's nuts, man.  It's amazing  they could live a normal life,  you know?  That's what blows me away too.  I learned a lot 
[02:53:00]  because I have sisters  and that  and this fucking happened  to me as a kid.  Anyone that brings up  the violin story  pretty much about anything  like, listen,  fuck off.  Fuck off.  Fuck you.  Fuck you.  These guys saw everything  and they did what you saw.  They were great Americans.  Hey, listen,  and that fucking cliche is true.  We wouldn't fucking be here  if they didn't win  that fucking war.  It's that simple.  They took on  the whole fucking world  and kicked the world's ass 
[02:53:30]  and came home.  Right.  And they kept their mouths shut  and became dads.  And gave us like  plasma fucking TVs  and college  and all the shit  that we have  comes from those...  That's why we have this shit.  Right.  And it leads to your song,  Dennis Lurie.  Kiss my ass.  That's right.  See?  Kiss Jim Brewer's dad's ass.  That's the new title  of that song.  Dennis got to do  the song out.  Funny or die.  It's called  Kiss Jim Brewer's dad's ass.  You fucking owe him.  Now you gotta go see it.  Go check it out  on what?  Funnyordie.com. 
[02:54:00]  Hey, you got food  at your show?  Because I'm starving.  No, we can order shit.  There must be some shit  in the building.  There's shit down...  There's pretzels  and little snacks.  We can get you some,  guys.  You can order stuff  downstairs.  Why don't we break it?  We gotta break.  No, just get like  some bagels or something.  You want something?  We can continue here, too.  Why don't you just  fucking use this  on your show?  What?  You already did it, bro.  You already did it.  Take our tape,  put it on your show,  call it a day.  We're good.

[02:57:00]  I still don't know how to load  One of these up into  I'm trying to load a picture  Into Instagram  From my photo  That's easy  I am  Do you?  Yes, Jimmy  Oh, you're full of turkey  Well, I'm putting a photo  On my Instagram  Instagram  How do you do it?  My Instagram is Opie Radio  And you're gonna get  A fine photo  Of Jim Norton 
[02:57:30]  Jim Brewer  Some nobody  Dennis Leary  Anthony Cumia  And Opie  How do you do it?  Mine is A-C-U-M-I-A  Who was that guy?  Thank you  Who was that guy?  He's in Dennis' band  He's a good guy  He's a bubble guppy too  So I gotta give him respect  Thanks  Do you know what a bubble guppy is?  Not at all  Nobody  He's a bubble guppy  What's that?  It's a bubble guppy  What the fuck is that shit?  It's a kid's show 
[02:58:00]  You gotta have a kid  To know bubble guppies  Oh, I've seen bubble guppies  He's a bubble  No, you haven't  Sure I haven't  No, you haven't  Of course, there's a black one  There's a black bubble guppy?  Yeah  Really?  Just saying  What were the black fish  Everyone has to be  What were the black fish  When we were growing up?  What?  I think there was one  What was it called?  I don't know  Black fish  What was it called?  The black fish?  Yeah  Trying to figure out  What filter makes us all  Look so handsome 
[02:58:30]  I, um  Ooh, Valencia  I have to apologize  I could fuck up a good picture  By just putting the Kelvin filter on  Kelvin sticks  Kelvin  When do you use Kelvin?  Does anyone know?  Oh, sorry Jimmy  Go ahead  That's okay  I was just gonna apologize  Again to DeRosa  Fuck DeRosa  Nah, I feel bad, man  I feel better now  I think it was a 24 hour  But I was genuinely fucked  I almost called out today  I called Kenny  And Kenny was like  Stay home if you don't feel well  You're going to Vegas  And I'm like  I just can't do it 
[02:59:00]  But I like the new Kenny  I got in his car all sick  And he's like  You shouldn't go to work  And I'm like  You know what?  Kenny, you're right  I was this close  I'm like Kenny lately  But no, he just doesn't want people  To kill themselves if they're sick  But if I wasn't out  Three days in a row last week  I would have taken today off  I'm sickly  But I feel bad for Joe  He had something arranged  We got to shoot  So I feel fucking awful  He'll live  Nah, but it's like  It's unprofessional  To do it the day before  But I'm not that guy  I'm afraid now  He's going to think  That I'm that guy  Who just backs out of shit 
[02:59:30]  But I never do  No, you don't  You're good like that  Hell's that  Does anyone know  Who that guy was?  Because I feel bad  Leaving him out of the photo  Dennis is bad  Did you  You didn't  I'll write some guy  I have to  Some guy  I didn't what?  You didn't  You didn't blur him, did you?  Yeah  Should I take the blur off?  No  That's true  Well, I haven't used the blur yet  On any photos 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, see what that's like  You gave it a little test-a-roo  Give it a little test-a-roo  You sure?  Yeah  See how that shit works  Honestly, I didn't  But now that  I hate being challenged  Because now I'm going to have to  Now you have to  There's just no  I'll tell you why it's funny  Because there's no reason for it  Right  But I don't want to like  You know, we have a good relationship  With Dennis Leary  I don't want to  He'll understand the humor of that, right?  He's fine  You sure?  Sure  What's he going to say?  Alright, I'm going to blur him out  It's ruining  It's ruining our fucking photo  What else is going on? 
[03:00:30]  Oh, during that whole thing  And then Brewer came in  Which fucking just hit out of the park  My God  Him and his storytelling  Is just amazing  Jim is a funny fuck, man  He's the best  We were going to play  The bottle rocket thing  For  The vagina  Shooting the bottle  Rocking out of the vagina  We were going to play that for him  Because he couldn't believe  We actually did that  How do you do a reverse blur? 
[03:01:00]  What do you mean a reverse blur?  Well, I've got to blur just him  How do you do that?  Oh, you've got him as the center dot  And around the edges are blurred  Or I can just blur all of us  And leave him  That's funnier  Blur all of us, please  That's funnier  This is so wrong  How do you reverse blur?  There's got to be a BR  Blur reverse  Blur reversal?  Let me just pinch it in real tight 
[03:01:30]  I pinched it in real tight  What are you talking about pinching it?  No, you're just blurring around a dot  So you've got a dot  That's not blurry  And then the outside of the dot is blurred  And you can adjust the size of the dot  But to blur a circle  I don't know if that can be done  In the Instagram  If you put the dot on his chest  It'll reach up and blur out his face  But then it'll blur everybody else's  I'm Instagramming a picture of myself  It blurred out everybody  Yeah, it'll blur everybody  Don't you know how to Instagram?  Oh, I know how to Instagram 
[03:02:00]  Oh, well, apparently not blur  I'm the king of the Instagram  Unfortunately, we can't blur out Fatty  In the photo  There is no can't  What?  Yes, there is  Huh?  It won't  There is no can't  I can't  I need a can't  All right  Can we play the bottle rocket thing?  Just because we did reference it on the show today  It is 4th of July  Just about  It's old school  And I want to hear how this went down  How long is the clip?  It's not long, right?  No, this one here is about 15, 20 seconds  I don't know if we can play stuff that we can't do 
[03:02:30]  Oh, is that another one of the dumb rules?  No, I'm just kidding  I don't think you're kidding, though  Well, let's play it  Did you run  Let's hear it  Please  And you were asking her  You were firing it into El Duque  Oh, it was El Duque, right  El Duque  Remember Frenchie who just didn't translate to the XM show?  Oh, no  Yes  Remember?  He was such a head  He didn't translate 
[03:03:00]  Suck it!  You are full of S!  And then when he comes on here  It just wasn't the same that he could curse?  No  Because he could curse and it ruined his whole act  There were a few guys we had to say goodbye to, unfortunately  Because they didn't translate  There were people that just, like, disappeared  He just said he couldn't make the jump  What's his...  What's...  I remember he bombed horribly  We didn't know what to do  Because he was one of our benchmark bits for a while  No one gave a shit about a cursing Frenchie  No one gave a shit because we could all curse  What about fucking... 
[03:03:30]  What's his name?  Limo Ant?  I miss Limo Ant  Oh, yeah  What happened to him?  I don't even want to know  What happened to Stockbroker Dave?  I mean, I say that because I don't know  I hope he's doing well  What happened to Spike?  Stockbroker Dave is...  He left Wall Street  Did he?  Yeah, we used to keep in touch  Does he occupy now?  He's an occupier  Just hates Wall Street  Yeah, he's one of those guys  No, I don't know  Now that we're talking about him, I'm sure  Why don't you suck it?  Why don't you lick my D? 
[03:04:00]  Yes  I'll put it in your A  Wait a minute  Why am I not...  Why is my fucking cock Instagram not going to my Twitter, too?  Hunk of shit  I stink at everything  You are a loser  He didn't translate  He just...  He couldn't make the leap  No  He certainly couldn't  How do I fucking share this?  Well, listen  Aw, Jimmy wants to share and he can't  I like sharing, Anthony 
[03:04:30]  I know  Who are we...  What am I going to say for that guy?  Because I got Jim Norton  Some nobody  Hang her on  Wait, who was next to Jim Norton in that photo?  Because I can't go back to it  Was it Brewer?  Jim Brewer  Was it?  Yeah, it was Brewer  I haven't seen the photo yet  Wait, was it...

He's in the middle too  Everyone else  Like him or hate him  You know him  Could have cropped him out 
[03:06:30]  I have a good smile  And I'm happy  I thought you were putting that smile on  No, I was happy  I like Brewer  It was fun  Brewer ruled  A good hanger on her nose  To step away from the group photos  That guinea grease is really fucking reacting with the sunlight  What's wrong?  I'm really looking like one of the Moors  Do you know the Moors invaded Sicily?  Yeah, you're tanner than anyone in that photo  Holy shit  Yeah, you're so tan  You ought to own a tan store or something  Ah, great one, Chip  Wasn't good

[03:08:00]  No  She was a fucking mess  Most of the girls we had in there  I'm sorry  She might still be listening  I'm the one that was smoking a cigarette out of a pussy  Hey, who needs a twat that  Pussies smell bad enough without cigarette breath  Cigarettes  Just drinks coffee out of it  Exactly  What else do you do?  Have a mento in there  Fucking cigarette breath puss  Eating a gyro  Ugh  Unions  Hurry  I can't think of anything  People are enjoying the some guy  And the description of that 
[03:08:30]  Some guy  Awesome photo  Some guy  How rude is that?  Look at him  Some guy  I think we could have been more creative  But fuck it  Some guy  The first commenter just asks  Who the fuck is that guy?  He's a bubble guppy  He told me in the bathroom  Big deal  Sing some song for  Oh, he does a voiceover?  Yeah, he does a lot of cartoon voices  And he said he's going to be the lead aunt  In a raid commercial or something 
[03:09:00]  Oh, he's got to yell  Raid!  I think he's one of those guys, yeah  He probably makes a lot of money  He says it's the national spot  He's a nice guy  I'll bet you he makes a great living doing that  If he does voiceover work, that's his job  And if he's one of those guys who sought after  He probably makes a shitload of money  A shitload  Yeah, they do make a lot  Like Billy West  Well, let's go home  I think we did it today  Yeah, I think we did it  Hit it out of the old park, as they say  Do you know when I was trying to sleep last night 
[03:09:30]  I wear that mouth guard now  Which helps a little bit  The machine is what I need  My nose was stuffy  I got a horrible night's sleep last night  And I kept dreaming like  Jim has to go to sleep  And you have to breathe  Because I don't think I was breathing  But my mouth was really dry  I was just thinking how much it would have sucked  For Patrice to be stuck with his mouth dry  Oh, don't think that  But I mean, just with a dry  Like, it's a weird thing  Like, a glass of water  Like, just to go out  Just to be able to get a glass  But like, what if you lived like that? 
[03:10:00]  Like, thank God he didn't live more than a month  But imagine if you lived like that  And you knew the routine  And when people walked  Like, you're like  Okay, I have nine hours  Until somebody comes back in here  To get me a drink  And they won't even know I want a drink  So they might just dab my lips  Give me a drink  No, you can't think like that  Just drive yourself nuts  No, but it makes me  Could be like the World War II guys  Talk about it  As much as it  It makes me very sad  It makes me kind of glad  That he didn't survive that  Like, because of that  Like, he doesn't have to deal with that 
[03:10:30]  He doesn't have to live with that  I couldn't handle no  Absolutely horrible  My God  To this day, it's still horrible  It's an awful one  I don't mean to bum everybody out  If we're leaving  Oh my God, you just  All right, boys and girls  Any plugs, Jim?  Just  The only things I'll plug  I am doing a thing in Montreal  With Bob Saget 
[03:11:00]  Montreal  Are you going to the comedy festival?

[03:11:30]  Who will be negative  Or people who didn't like it  But even if the critics  Blast it  I feel like the people  I made it to entertain  Have been entertained by it  Oh absolutely  And it really  It felt oddly comforting  So I appreciate all your tweets  I mean  I didn't take it like  It was ass kissing  It felt very genuine  And I just  Thank you guys  I'm happy those of you  That saw it loved it  Or liked it even  I like  I like when they show  They're human beings  Nah but it was nice  I kind of like that sometimes  Because it does mean a lot  Their opinions mean a lot  Obviously  Of course  I mean you know 
[03:12:00]  There's nothing wrong  With a human emotion  Every once in a while  Saturday August 11th  I'm with Artie, Nick, and Dave  In right outside Chicago  Doing the Horseshoe Casino  And Saturday August 25th  Just me and Dave alone  In the Hampton Beach Casino  Ballroom  All alone  Why?

[03:14:30]  Waldo has a red shirt  Maybe blue and gray  Yeah but it is the same pattern  I understand why  But it's stripes  Same pattern  Did he tell Kenny to fuck himself?  I didn't tell him to fuck himself  He wasn't that severe with him  Kenny definitely got the upper hand  In that little back and forth  I will say that  What's Kenny's bit today?  Jimmy you know every day  He has a bit in the hallways right?  No  No the problem is today  There's not enough people here  For him to do his bits  What were some of his bits last week alone?
