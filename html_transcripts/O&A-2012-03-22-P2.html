<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with comedian Robert Kelly as a guest.  The hosts immediately launched into a scathing critique of Kelly’s website, calling it “convoluted” and poorly designed, specifically targeting the confusing placement of tour dates and merchandise.  This led to a heated exchange, with Kelly defending his site's design choices while the hosts relentlessly offered unsolicited advice, punctuated by profanity and insults from both sides. The discussion broadened to encompass the general merits and drawbacks of various technologies.  The hosts demonstrated the String augmented reality app, and the conversation included comparisons of Kelly's website to those of other comedians, notably Louis C.K.'s (cited by a caller as superior) and Jim Norton's (described as similarly poorly designed).  The segment transitioned to a discussion of the ease of accessing content online versus physical media.  

The show then shifted focus to a Seagate GoFlex portable hard drive for iPads, with detailed discussion of its features, including its size, capacity (500 GB), and built-in Wi-Fi.  Concerns were raised about its reliability and limited storage, with a caller mentioning high failure rates in certain Seagate drives. The conversation segued into Apple TV, its limitations, and the advantages of jailbreaking it to play various video formats (like MKV and AVI).  The hosts discussed using Handbrake for video conversion and the benefits of a dedicated media server.  A caller shared their experience switching from a laptop to an iPad.  This part of the show also included a humorous, albeit somewhat poorly managed, phone call from a listener, and an extended, unfavorable comparison of Arcos MP3 players to iPods.  The segment, like the first, was liberally peppered with expletives, especially the word "fucking," reflecting the hosts' enthusiastic or frustrated reactions to the discussed technology.  Finally, despite the earlier friction, the hosts promoted Kelly's upcoming comedy shows.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  What the hell is this?  That's the Bob Kelly, you know what, dude, show, welcome everybody.  Shows how much you listen to Bob's podcast.  Fuck his stupid podcast.  Oh, really, dude?  Yeah, fuck it, it's math.  Is that how you fucking roll?  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Now you're on this show.  You're in this house now.  Selling my fucking posters, you cocksucker.  Those are good for you, right? 
[00:00:30]  The posters on the merch page?  Yeah, man.  One of the most popular things we sold.  Excellent, yeah, those came out really good.  I'm glad that that worked out.  Oh, who's serious now, huh?  Who's all fucking whipped up now?  Are you not kidding, motherfucker?  I know, I'm kidding.  No, those posters came out good.  We sold like 50 of them on the merch page.  That's great, man.  We only, I think we have 30 left, that's it.  Yeah, those went good.  If you want, what's the merch page?  Give it a plug.  Riotcast.com.  Yeah, Riotcast.com.  Bobby did this great live.  Do you have that link on your website?  Riotcast.com? 
[00:01:00]  Yeah.  Riotcast.com, right at the top of the page, merch.  No, no, no, I'm saying if people go to robertkellylive.com, is it linked on your website?  Yeah, just go to my podcast and it brings you to the...  Oh, that's...  Yeah, I know.  Bobby, we got to talk about your...  We should probably talk about your website.  I don't even see where your podcast is.  Let's do it.  Your website is very convoluted.  Yeah, well, here, it's not really a website.  I went to...  It's called Who Say.  Yeah, but it used to be like more of a cohesive thing, right?  Yeah, it used to be an actual website and I, uh...  Listen to...  Okay, it's...  It's very difficult to find, man.  Did you hear what he just said?  Oh, man.  You know what Travis was doing? 
[00:01:30]  No.  It's like my wife while I'm trying to fucking listen to the navigation system.  I'm trying to sell you some posters and I can't find it on your fucking website.  Take it right.  Do we go heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven...  Yeah, my website's a little weird.  Yeah, because, like, you just kind of want to go there for the basics, because, like,  you know, if you're a fan of Bobby, you know to get him on Twitter and you know where you  can find him.  You know he's on Riotcast, but then you go to his website just looking for what's there  and everything's kind of all over the place.  Well, it's a Who Say page.  And if you look to the right, all my shit's there.  Podcasts, dates, all that shit is to the right. 
[00:02:00]  But why not?  And it's just video and photos.  Look at Who Say.  Why is that fucked up?  It's just very busy.  Yeah, it is very busy.  How's it busy?  It's not busy.  Look at all this stuff on it.  Yeah, look, there's, like, there's already two menus I could go when you scroll.  Well, because you've got the top bar that stays there, and then you've got your own thing.  Yeah, this thing has nothing to do with you.  It's just very weird.  So you're saying that I should go back to my old website?  Yes.  Yeah, you know why?  Because the first thing that you do when you go to Robert Kelly Live is all of a sudden  I see some, like, recent photo that you took, and I'm, like, already confused. 
[00:02:30]  Like, why am I in the middle of something already?  Because those are photos I took, so you can go there and actually see photos.  Yeah, but every comedian's dates are very easy to find.  Yeah.  I have to scroll all the way down here to get to your dates.  Wait a minute.  You say all the way down.  Yes.  Let's do that again.  Let's do that again.  Go here.  Okay, ready?  Now go.  All the way.  Now you're there.  Yeah, but you know what on the side?  What the fuck is wrong with you?  First of all, it's on the bottom, and it's on the bottom right side.  It's not on the bottom.  It's on the right.  My brain wants me to dismiss it as a banner ad.  Yeah. 
[00:03:00]  Yeah, stuff on the right side is usually ads.  That's laughstub.com.  Yeah, and that's a great website.  We were talking about that earlier.  Yeah, that's the thing that they provide.  Comedian tickets.  You don't ever have to, and that would be on my website anyways.  Yeah, but there should be, see, trending, latest photos, videos, social.  I should hit that.  That's it.  You like that.  You love that.  You want it up there.  Yeah, because people are so immediate now.  Where do I buy something?  Go there.  Go.  Like, how do I?  I go to your page.  Now I'm like, oh, I want one of those things.  Scroll down right there.  Look.  Right there.  Scroll.  I shouldn't have to.  Right here.  It says buy. 
[00:03:30]  Buy.  It's too much, man.  It's too much.  So you're saying, stop for one second.  Go to the top.  Go to the top.  Now, I'm going to count while I take, no, scroll.  I want you to scroll.  Go to scrolling.  First of all.  Do what you told Travis.  Stop fucking doing things on your own.  Go to the scroll.  Go to the scroll.  Ready?  Here we go.  What are you even talking about going to the scroll?  Scroll down.  Scroll down, stupid.  This website.  That's it.  One second.  It took you one second to get there.  Look at this.  This site would look better as a WordPress blog.  Yeah. 
[00:04:00]  What's WordPress?  You see this button that says trending?  Yes.  Watch what happens when I click on it.  Yeah.  It's your website.  Nothing.  It's just your website.  Absolutely nothing.  That button is useless.  What is latest?  It's the same thing.  Bobby, your website says it.  All you're doing is changing trending to latest down here.  What's videos?  What's social?  You have two buttons that are completely useless that should say tour dates and merchandise. 
[00:04:30]  Right.  Well, you know what?  He just goes right.  You know what, dude?  Some guy's down here.  Some dude's at my feet right now.  Well, you know, I went out.  So now that we've dissected your website.  I went out.  Now let's go to your websites.  Let's.  Oh, I get it.  Listen, I agree that the website isn't as functional as a regular website, but I don't really like websites.  Yeah, but Bobby, it's all about helping you and helping people out there.  I don't believe that's true.  I don't believe that's true. 
[00:05:00]  You want people to listen to you on Riotcast?  You want people checking out these cool posters?  Go to Riotcast.  That's all.  Yeah, but I mean.  Go to Riotcast.com.  You know what, dude?  Podcast.  That's all they want people to do.  But then you got dates, too.  I like your merch.  That's a good shirt, right?  Yeah.  I like your coffee cup.  What's the coffee cup say?  Dude, I got my coffee boom.  Really?  That's great.  That's what it says?  Yeah.  Who'd have thunk it?  Dude.  It's hysterical.  What about the Dangerous Joe shirt?  Go down to the bottom to the red.  What about that?  A little Joe DeRosa?  That's a good one. 
[00:05:30]  There you go.  We got the Gataphite shirt.  A lot of shit on there.  I love Joe holding up the poster.  Well, that's that.  Miserable.  Look how miserable he is.  He doesn't look at me.  Dude, hold this up.  Fuck.  Look at how miserable he is signing the posters.  It's a great poster.  Yeah, it's a good poster.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I was really lucky to be able to help out on that.  That was fucking great, that show.  You didn't go to the show.  I wanted to.  I had Primus, man.  I'm sorry.  Oh, sorry.  Primus is so much more important than you to me.  We get it.  We get it.  You're going for the mean comedy bit. 
[00:06:00]  I don't know.  You know what?  There's a lot of time until 11 o'clock.  Yeah, yeah.  Settle down.  If I pack my sentences full of words, it'll go by faster.  No, it was actually awesome.  That was a fucking great night.  That was a lot of fun.  We had Bob DeBono playing Voss because Voss couldn't be there.  I don't know if you've ever heard of him.  Yeah, he's called in a few times.  He's just spot on.  He is fucking hilarious.  I love him.  And McFarlane was great, too.  And Joe killed it, too.  Hang on.  Do I have to sign up on Riot Guest?  You can't just check out as a guest.  Oh, my God.  What's that?  Do I have to create an account to buy your poster? 
[00:06:30]  No.  Bobby.  What?  You should just let people sign in as a guest.  What are you talking about?  You can.  No, you can't.  Yeah, you can.  No, you can't.  Not you.  Not you.  I don't allow it for you.  Oh, okay.  It's specific to this.  I don't fucking know.  What the fuck?  You know what?  You fucking nagging heads.  I am your customer.  Fuck yourself.  We're helping.  I didn't ask.  I didn't ask.  So fuck you.  And fuck you, you fucking alternative fucking hip bitch.  How many fucking hoops I got to jump through to get a fucking cheap t-shirt? 
[00:07:00]  None.  I don't want you to get one.  That's what it is.  I want real fans to work to get it.  If you can't fill out a form, fuck you.  To buy something from you.  Don't get it.  If you've done the work to actually find how to check out, you might as well just take  the extra stuff.  Because at that point, you're at the point of no return.  I don't want people like you.  I don't want half fucking people like you.  All you got to do is click on the cam girl and then sign up for our monthly rebilling.  That's right.  That's right.  I don't want you there. 
[00:07:30]  I don't want you guys a fucking nagging douchebags.  No.  I just know how lazy everybody is on the internet now.  It doesn't matter.  No.  It doesn't matter.  I don't want them.  Why are we being yelled at?  I don't.  Because you're assholes.  Because he knows we're right.  No.  You're nagging little bitches.  But it's not.  How is it nagging if we're trying to help you?  Yeah.  You're not trying to help me.  I'm not saying, wow, Bob, that poster sucks.  We want you to sell more posters and sell more t-shirts and sell more merch.  I want to sell only 30.  I want to sell 30.  But maybe you could have sold like 100 if people knew how to do it.  I told you.  I would love to know if somebody has clicked on that and said, oh, I got to create an account. 
[00:08:00]  Never mind.  Good.  I don't give a fuck.  Password.  I don't care.  I don't care.  I don't care.  Yeah, you do.  I really don't.  Look at me.  Look at me.  I really don't, Travis.  Watch what I'm doing.  I'm removing this from my company.  Please.  Remove it and remove yourself from my life.  I really don't give a shit.  I really don't care.  Great poster, though, if you want to take the time to sign up.  Yeah, you can go to Danny's page and get it, too.  How easy is it to get your page? 
[00:08:30]  You could either go through the 8 million things that you got to do to buy one on Bobby's side,  or you could just go to Goodnight Sweet Prince.  That's Prince, P-R-I-N-T-S, and just pick one up.  Wait, what's Sweet Prince?  Is that your page?  Yeah, it's just a little store page.  But it's called Sweet Prince?  Goodnight Sweet Prince.  Do you make prints?  Not, well, starting to.  I mean, I collect.  I sell some.  Let's go to your, I want to see your page.  Let me see how easy it is.  Maybe I'll learn something.  Yeah, I mean, it's really just easy.  Let's just go.  You don't have to sign up for anything, that's for sure.  Well, all right.  Well, let's look good.  Look, there's your poster, front and center. 
[00:09:00]  $25.  Look, you want it right now, just add it to the card.  Aren't you?  You should charge more.  You're charging more, you fucking idiot?  $25.  I thought that's what we had all agreed upon.  Let me see.  Let's see how easy it is.  There you go.  Just check out with PayPal.  Boom!  Now it just goes right to PayPal.  Now you've got to fill out all this shit.  No, you don't.  You just log into your PayPal account, which everyone has.  You've got to do a password, and that's a lot of shit to put in there.  So I have a long password.  So what you're saying is my website is convoluted.  Yes.  It's just very busy. 
[00:09:30]  Very busy.  It's very busy.  Stop saying that, because I used to date a chick that used to say that to me all the  time.  Probably you're very busy.  Why is that busy?  Well, your website is very busy.  It's very busy.  It's very busy.  So the website's busy, and the Riotcast, you should be able to sign in as a guest.  Well, yeah, you know, because it's like...  What else?  Well, I guess we could keep going.  You could.  Look at all the dates I have.  Jesus Christ.  That's actually one date.  It's Reno.  Fucking there for a month, for Christ's sakes.  Jesus Christ.  I'm going to kill myself.  It's just that we love you guys, and we want to see you guys. 
[00:10:00]  You know who's got the shittiest merch page of all?  I think it's Jim.  Dude, Jim's got a terrible merch page.  Actually, go to his merch page.  I want to see what it looks like.  And it's like, these guys, you know, they could have really fun stuff, and sell great  stuff, and have a good-looking page, and Jesus Christ, what is this?  Wait a minute.  Does Jim have a logo?  If you want to call it that.  Is that his Sufi?  What is that?  Is that Jim Sufi?  That's a J-N-N.  You know what that looks like?  Some fan got in touch with him, and was like, dude, I can make you something really good,  and that's what you get when you get free shit. 
[00:10:30]  What do you think, man?  It's a J-N-N.  I mean, that's pretty cool.  Yeah, it looks like the Yankees.  I like it.  It's good.  You should try it.  Wow.  But, I mean, you know...  That's not a bad page.  I mean, look at that.  Look at...  Wait a second.  You get a CD.  Go down.  You got another CD.  Go ahead.  Look at...  There's his books.  Hit a book.  Let's see how easy it is to get a book.  Bam.  Boom.  Right on Amazon.  Boom.  You're right there.  But you guys could all do this yourself.  That's all.  It's just so easy.  Okay.  Well, fucking do it.  Take care of it.  I'll do it.  I would love to.  Bob, I would...  I'm not like a website, dude, but as far as getting all that other stuff together, man... 
[00:11:00]  What other stuff?  Is it getting merch pages together and getting the right kind of merch just so it doesn't  look like shit?  Here it comes.  Here what comes?  Here it comes.  Well...  Danny's new fucking...  No, no.  You know what?  As a matter of fact, Bob...  Hey, do whatever.  All right.  Do-do-do-do-do-do.  I do merch pages now.  Well, I'm saying...  Look, I'm not saying that's what I do.  Here it comes.  But you could do it yourself.  Here it comes.  Or you could just have some help.  What's the new website, Danny?  Nothing.  What's the new merch page?  There's no merch page. 
[00:11:30]  Why is Travis and his phone getting uncomfortable because Daddy and Mommy are about to go at  it?  I'm not uncomfortable.  I said what I had to say about your website.  You have buttons that don't make any sense being there, and I can't find your dates and  your merch.  First of all, trending, if you hit the button and you look at the screen, you could hit it  again.  Watch what happens.  See?  Yep.  That was good.  There you go.  But don't you agree that at least...  What's up, buddy?  Why not have some help if someone's offering to say, hey, let's pump this up a little bit.  Okay.  Help me.  All right.  We will.  All right.  What are you going to do? 
[00:12:00]  Let's get you some fun stuff.  Let's get you...  I'm serious.  Some fun stuff.  Yeah, man.  I really can't stand you.  What do you mean, fun stuff?  Well, first of all...  Yes, first of all.  As far as merchandise...  Stop saying first of all.  Just say it.  We don't need first...  Because you never give a second of all, which aggravates you.  Well, all right.  A baby follows Voss.  You know what you need, Bob?  He never gives a third of all.  You need a t-shirt.  Yeah, look.  There's no t-shirt there.  It's already in the make.  Okay, good.  Yeah.  Well, see, now, how come you didn't ask me about that?  What?  T-shirt.  What's up with that?  You make t-shirts? 
[00:12:30]  I can.  Oh, see.  Here it is.  It's not hard.  All this shit isn't hard to do.  Do you think Danny just wants a cut of your merchandise sales?  No, Danny wants in.  Hey, this page stinks.  I'll go to you, Danny.  I just want something to do.  Go home.  I refresh the same seven websites until fucking 8 o'clock.  I go to sleep, and I repeat my day.  What's your websites?  All of Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, message boards, fucking, you know, eBay.  I was trying not to look at Twitter for a day, and it was impossible, like not to go 
[00:13:00]  to the app on my phone or even on the side of the computer at all, and it was almost impossible.  I think it's easy to do, but everybody has that thing that they're going to be addicted  to all day long, whether it's Twitter or Facebook or stocks or whatever it is.  It's not even addicted to actually what people write or the new stuff.  It's that little blue dot that's under mentions or under new.  When you see that lit up that you know there's new shit, you get addicted to that.  Yeah, it is not.  Well, it's like when you send out a tweet, and then you just kind of sit there waiting  like, oh, you could judge if it's a good one. 
[00:13:30]  If someone writes something back really quickly, or if you're sitting there for 10 minutes and  you got shit, you're like, all right, I guess that one kind of missed.  Yeah, it's fucking, it's very addictive.  I tried to get off of it.  What's up?  Oh, I can't wait.  Here we go.  I just wanted to take this phone call real quick.  Matt in Toronto.  What's up, man?  Hey, how you doing, boys?  Travis, big fan.  Love you.  Love you.  Thanks.  One thing I wanted to say about Bob's piece of shit website is that Louis CK sold a special  online.  Wait, please don't, please do not compare me to Louis CK. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, wait, Matt, you got to slow down because you're all over the place.  You're going from like a busy, a busy webpage to Louis CK.  You're talking about the most popular comic in the world doing his special online and then  my page.  I'm in Reno next week, you cocksucker.  All week.  Listen, motherfucker.  Easy, easy, easy.  You know, for someone so obsessed with technology to fill another void in your life that food  can't, you might as well be up to date on your fucking website.  Yeah.  Matt, you make a great point, man. 
[00:14:30]  I don't like that Matt's going to swear every other way.  Because you know what the funny thing is, because right before the show, Bobby's like,  hey, I want to talk tech.  I want to talk tech at some point because Bobby loves talking tech.  But then you go to his webpage and it looks like that.  I understand, but you guys don't understand that I went from the craziest websites.  I had those Flash websites.  I had some of the craziest websites.  Oh, you know what your best website was?  I remember.  The ball?  No, Travis.  Do you remember when you'd mouse over?  Yeah, and I didn't say stuff.  Yeah, and like, this is back when MySpace was big.  MySpace.  Yeah, exactly.  You'd mouse over and just go, MySpace. 
[00:15:00]  I would never even click into your MySpace.  I would just mouse over it all day long just so you'd say MySpace.  It was a cartoon.  It was like a comic book.  And everyone had a little thing.  I had the craziest websites of them all.  I had the one where I walked out on the top and there was a liquid ball and I grabbed  it and threw it in the middle.  You don't need that.  You just need something that people could find.  Here's another thing.  When I mouse over social, it says view on Twitter and view on YouTube.  Where's your Facebook link?  I don't do Facebook.  Yes, you do.  I can't.  I'm not in college.  You're on Facebook.  Facebook's just college people. 
[00:15:30]  Isn't it?  You're right.  Yeah.  800 million people in college.  So I'll redo.  Is Matt still there?  And you know those ways that you could link.  Is Matt there?  I am.  He's there.  Hi, buddy.  Yeah, okay.  So Matt, what you're saying is the website.  My website's not good enough, right?  Well, it's just, I mean, I've heard a lot of guys have a discussion that you don't even  need a website anymore with Twitter and Facebook, but I don't think so.  Like, I think if you have the ability to put out a little more original content in a way  that it's not just Twitter or Facebook. 
[00:16:00]  But that's, if you go to my website.  Hold on.  If you go to my web.  Go ahead.  It gives you a bigger advantage than just dates and all of that.  Yeah, I know.  Exactly.  How difficult it is to listen to the You Know What Dude podcast.  Right.  Here, here.  What'd you say?  Oh, fuck.  Thanks a lot, man.  I think that he's right in one way, but if you look at that, that's actually, the content  that goes on that website, the video and the photos, doesn't all make it to Facebook and  Twitter all the time.  So there's original video and original content up there that doesn't always make it. 
[00:16:30]  The thing behind this Who Say page is that you can't just get a Who Say page.  The average guy, you can't get a Who Say page.  You can't get a Who Say page.  We should try to get a Who Say page.  You can't.  You won't be able to get one because it's run by CAA.  And they're out of business now.  And the average asshole can't have one like a Facebook or a Twitter.  So it brings everybody to one location.  I can Who Say stuff out to Twitter and Facebook, and it's all out of one thing. 
[00:17:00]  That's the whole thing behind this.  So basically, so this is making it convenient for you rather than your family.  It makes it convenient for me, but it also brings everybody to one spot.  So when I Who Say a photo or a video out or something out, it brings them to Who Say where  my date, not Facebook, not Twitter, it brings them to this page where my dates, my CD, all  the other stuff is to the right.  Why can't that just be a web page?  So you can look at it.  And then you plug that.  It is a website, but it's not, what you're saying, it's just too much shit going on.  Well, I don't know about the layout or the design.  I just don't think it's in the right place. 
[00:17:30]  Like, I should see your tour dates, and I should see where I can listen to your podcast right  away.  Well, here's the thing, too, is I don't believe in fucking websites anymore.  Well, there you go.  Because I've been through, I've had them for years, and they really, if you look at  the analytics of a website compared to a Twitter, a Facebook, or an app, it's stupid.  Nobody goes to your website.  People are going to go to it from your Twitter.  More people use my app or my Twitter or my Facebook to find out where the fuck I'm going  to be than my website.  There's really, websites are being phased the fuck out for comics. 
[00:18:00]  I get more, I get more off of my podcast.  I get more people going to my shows from my podcast.  You want to talk about social media for a comic, fuck Facebook, fuck Twitter, do a podcast,  because more, your true fans, first of all, the people that pay to come and see you will  actually have to, you say, have to go and actually do something to listen to your podcast.  So you know they're fans.  It's not just the average asshole tuning in for one time. 
[00:18:30]  You have to go, download it, subscribe, listen every week.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, absolutely.  So that's actually the best fuck-up website.  That's how people go to my show.  Nobody goes to a website, really.  Nobody goes to a JimNortonEatABullet.com.  What if they want to buy a t-shirt?  What's that?  Well, what if they want to buy a t-shirt?  They go to a show.  I'll tell you what you are going to do.  They do buy a t-shirt.  What's that?  No, I'm not saying they don't.  I'm very good at t-shirt.  You're a great Instagrammer.  I love this photo right here. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah, I saw that.  I was laughing very hard at that.  It's for a local New York show called Vocal People or whatever.  Yeah.  And I don't know.  It's like these people in these white, what would you call that?  Like white body suits or whatever?  Just all white little fucking-  Bald.  They all kind of do look like Bobby with their mouths open.  It's hysterical.  Yeah, I was walking by and I was like, take a picture.  I was with my wife.  I was like, take a picture.  She's like, why?  And I'm just shut up and take a picture.  It's a good picture.  I like Instagram.  You're on Instagram too, Trav.  Yes, I am.  Danny, are you on it?  Yeah, but I don't remember what my stupid name is.  Really?  It's probably just Hello Exactly. 
[00:19:30]  Your girl's on it, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  She takes good photos.  Dude, she does, man.  I hate her, actually, because we'll go out and like we both-  Everybody has an iPhone in their pocket.  We're all capable of taking the same pictures.  Yeah.  That bitch's photos are always fucking a million times better than mine,  time and time again.  What is Coke Logic saying?  Is Bobby going to avoid Twitter for unplugged?  Oh, let's see.  Sorry, I didn't see him.  Coke, what's up, man?  Good evening.  What's up, Buster?  Hey, Bobby, tomorrow's unplugged day.  Are you going to fucking avoid Twitter and electronics? 
[00:20:00]  Wait a minute.  Stop for one second.  You mean that's a thing just once a year or every-  Yeah.  I think we're making it up for this year.  It's the first annual.  You know what?  I'm actually going to try that.  I didn't even know that it was happening.  I'm going to fucking-  What's it, Friday?  Yeah.  Yeah, Friday from sunset to Saturday to sunset.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like the Jews?  Yeah.  Yeah, unplugged day or as Jewish people call it, Saturday.  So when is it from-  But you could have someone else read your text message and then you could dictate.  That's perfectly allowed. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah.  So Friday at sunset to Saturday was-  Saturday at sunset.  24 hours.  Wow.  Turn off your phone.  Like, literally, do not touch that.  The phone.  Yeah, the phone.  I have an uncle in a hospital.  The phone, the internet, everything.  Yeah, I know.  There's always going to be an excuse.  What if my dad needs to talk to me?  My grandmother's in a fucking, in an old people place.  Are you doing it?  You're not doing it.  No, fuck.  I love technology.  I love technology, too, man.  It's so fucking awesome now.  How great is it?  How fucking awesome is technology?  It is pretty cool. 
[00:21:00]  I mean-  I did that fucking app that Anthony was talking about, the Augmented Reality app.  Yeah, well, and that technology is just going to get bigger and better, and it's going  to start making its way into almost everything.  Dude, that string app on iPhone is fucking crazy.  You get the string app, then you print out the dragon or whatever.  It's like a tattoo.  You print it out.  You put it anywhere.  You turn the app on, and a fucking dragon-  It's like a hole opens up in the wall or the table, wherever you put that photo. 
[00:21:30]  But now, isn't that just an animation that-  No.  You can look inside of the hole.  Like, move your phone around, and it goes inside all the way around, like, all the way  around, and then a dragon comes out.  And you can literally go around the dragon, and it's on every side of it, on top of it,  whatever.  And that's cool.  It's crazy.  Is it scary?  But they're going to have tattoos of that shit, and they can actually make a tattoo,  and if you have the app, you can look at somebody's tattoo, and a fucking real dragon  will come out of a guy's chest.  Yeah.  That's crazy.  For advertising and stuff? 
[00:22:00]  It's cool.  But I mean, as far as productivity, I can't imagine using that for anything.  Like, me, as a user.  What would I do with that besides show someone else?  Promote your website and your posters.  Yeah, but I'm saying, like-  How great would a t-shirt be if you had-  You know they have those little code boxes now?  Yeah.  They have the code to advertise.  Or you're going by downtown square, and they have these augmented reality posters up instead  of just plain billboards, and you can hold your camera up, and the shit just comes alive. 
[00:22:30]  Do I have to be inside the app, or do I just turn on my camera?  You have to be inside the app.  Okay.  You have to be inside the app, so-  But it's still fucking nuts.  Yeah, it's cool.  It's fucking crazy.  And it works on a computer screen, too.  You don't need to print out the piece of paper.  You can just have the thing on the computer screen, and a fucking dragon flies out of your fucking computer.  Yeah, I didn't try that.  I'm going to have to try that, because-  Yeah, it's called string.  I just can't imagine what I would do with it, besides go to someone else and be like,  look at this.  It's crazy.  It's crazy.  Want to see a dragon?  It's crazy.  Yeah, but it is true. 
[00:23:00]  After a couple minutes, people go, all right, I get it.  But that shit's crazy to me.  Well, is this part of the tech talk segment?  No, Bob has a super secret thing he doesn't want to talk about.  Because, I mean, we're already talking tech.  You know what Travis is?  You know what Travis is?  Travis is like a fucking snob.  He really is like that fucking douche in college.  He's not a snob.  No, because everything he does, when you talk to him, he's like, yeah, man, that's great.  And then he gets on air, and he's like, Bob has a super secret thing he wants to do.  Because we wanted to ask him.  He's the redhead in every fucking movie. 
[00:23:30]  Just the cunty redhead.  Because you said, I want to talk about something.  Danny and I said, what?  And you said, I can't tell you.  Yeah, but Steve, his tone right now is just snobby and cunty.  And you're acting like, I'm the snob.  He really is just a fucking, that little gay aristocrat.  He doesn't have to act.  I mean, the aristocrat party does.  He really is.  He's that little fucking douchebag.  You're right.  I'm the snob.  You're the one that won't tell us what you want to talk about.  He's Tim Roth and Rob Roy.  Just half gay, half macho.  That's probably a movie I should watch, huh? 
[00:24:00]  Rob Roy?  Yeah.  That's fucking great.  I've been missing a ton of them.  I really got to get back into like, you know what?  My attention span these days isn't long enough to sit and watch a movie anymore.  Like, I can't.  I got to get up.  Here's a movie not to watch, Immortals.  That sounds like something I wouldn't watch.  Here's a movie.  The new, what's that fucking movie that's out from when he went to Mars?  What's that fucking movie?  Oh, Total Recall.  No.  Fucking asshole.  The new one.  What's the new movie that just came out?  Oh, John Carter.  John Carter.  Great movie. 
[00:24:30]  I heard it was like, ooh.  Okay, here's how the movie's better.  Ready?  Before you go in, know that this book was written in the 40s.  Know before Star Wars, Star Trek, before all this shit, this book was written that this  guy went to Mars, and that will put it in a whole different perspective.  Okay.  Oh, put that up.  Put the dragon up.  Go to printables.  We're all over the place.  Now we're back to the app where the dragon comes out of the wall.  I'm going to show you this.  You're going to flip the fuck out with this.  Where's printables?  Hang on.  Yeah, John Carter was a really good movie. 
[00:25:00]  If you go in with that perspective, this shit was written in the 40s.  Yeah, I mean, I knew that much.  I knew it was an old story.  I don't know much about the story.  It was pretty good.  Typically, those huge blockbuster epics, I'm just not about those.  Product?  And I'm not about this one, either.  It's a huge bomb for...  Who was the company?  Disney was behind that?  Yeah, I mean, that's 200 million on that.  Yeah, big time flop.  Yeah, it was bad.  Flop and Rooney.  And you know what's going to do good is that Hunger Games is real.  Yeah, I heard that.  It's all fucking advertising, man.  I thought John Carter was actually good, but Immortals, one of the worst movies I've ever 
[00:25:30]  seen.  Did you see that in the theater, or is that something that was home?  I almost did, because the 300, you always see that shit.  Oh, the guy who...  I hate how they trick you with that shit.  The man who made 300.  And it's actually...  It's a grip.  The grip on the 300.  That's like if me and Travis were going to produce your radio show, he'd be, from the  producers of Opie and Anthony.  And it's just like, who cares?  It's just some douchebags and a computer.  Yeah, the best boy from Forrest Gump. 
[00:26:00]  But it was terrible.  Mickey Rourke.  He...  It had so much potential to be good.  And it looked just like the 300, right?  Like, from what I saw, like, in the trailer.  Like, the shitty...  It had that visual aspect to it, where it was, like, oversaturated.  Not even as good.  Like, that washed out sort of look.  Not even as good.  Not even as good, no.  Because there's been, like, a thousand movies that have done that, so it's just like, why  do that again?  It was so fucking terrible.  Oh, here we go.  It's so fucking terrible, man.  I was so disappointed.  I was so excited to see it.  Ready?  All right, here we go.  So, what do I do? 
[00:26:30]  Point your camera at an image target.  All right.  So, Travis and Bobby now have their phones out with the app.  You gotta make that smaller so it fits in the screen.  And they're trying to get this app called String to show me this dragon that comes out.  Look.  Okay.  Look.  All right.  Look.  Yeah, all right.  That's cool.  No, I gotcha.  Okay, so basically what's happening...  Wait, wait, wait.  I see.  Look at him.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Look, you can see inside.  Inside, yeah, I gotcha.  That's crazy.  So, it's almost like playing...  It's almost like Portal, in a way, where it's creating, like, a little wormhole. 
[00:27:00]  ...in the thing that you could look into.  Yeah, and it gives you the 360 of the animation.  That's not fucking nuts to you.  Well, that's not nuts to you.  That's cool.  That's not fucking crazy.  You guys are so...  I mean...  You know what you are?  You're a fuck...  The technology is cool.  The fact is, is you never had fucking shit toys as a kid.  Sure I did.  I played with He-Man and Masters of the Universe.  Those aren't shit toys.  Yes, they are.  Dude, I had a fucking Tonka truck.  The thing just rolled back and forth, you assholes. 
[00:27:30]  But you see how I can...  Like, Travis, you can never use this for anything.  Like, you would just be like...  You would just be like, hey, look at what you can do with this.  And that's fun.  But that's exactly why I un-jail-broked my phone.  Because I jail-broked my phone.  And I said, oh, look at all this cool shit that you can do that I'll never fucking use.  Is it jail-broked?  I don't care.  I'll jail-broken...  Broke it?  Broke it.  But anyway, I went back because it was just like, while, yes, you can do all these things,  you never, ever use them practically.  The technology is very cool.  Here you go.  Here's what you're saying.  You're the same motherfuckers that when I said the iPad. 
[00:28:00]  What do you need an iPad for?  I mean, everybody in this fucking studio said the same shit.  But you know what?  Hang on.  I said, you gotta have an iPad.  It's the fucking...  And everybody was like, dude, fuck the iPad.  I got a phone.  You don't need the iPad.  Now everybody, dude, my iPad is the best fucking thing ever.  They got two or three fucking iPads.  Personally, the only thing I ever use my iPad for is watching Netflix before I pass out.  But you love it.  Honestly, half the time I have to charge it because I never use it.  What do you got, the original iPad?  If I had the two, it would still be used for the same thing.  Do you have the original?  I do. 
[00:28:30]  Is your battery dying?  No, that's fine.  Oh, because I'm going to say, here's the trick.  If your battery does die, you can bring it back and they'll give you a new one for a hundred bucks.  Yeah, I mean, if I was going to put money into a new iPad...  Dude, here's the deal.  You're watching TV in your bed, streaming from somewhere else.  Any fucking thing you want to watch, pretty much.  In your bed, okay?  Ten years ago, you couldn't fucking do that.  That's crazy.  That's fucking nuts.  And 20 years ago, it was one TV in a fucking one room and everybody had to watch the same shit. 
[00:29:00]  And there was fucking eight channels.  But maybe...  You're in bed in your fucking shitty twin mattress by yourself...  It's a queen.  It's a queen.  Okay?  Watching fucking a plasma TV, your personal plasma in your bed.  That's fucking retarded.  And then you can go check your Twitter on it.  Then you can write an email.  I mean, there's a million things you can do with it.  It's almost like just having a laptop with you.  It's almost just like that.  Yeah, but it's not a laptop because a laptop in bed fucking blows.  Yeah, I hate typing fucking correct sentences. 
[00:29:30]  You say right now that this shit...  What would I do with it?  No.  Exactly.  Nothing now.  But in a few years...  Yeah, but you know what, though?  This will be in your life somehow.  Things have been amazing for quite some time.  Because, you know, you want to talk about ten years ago.  I mean, ten years ago, I was already playing, you know, fucking...  How old am I?  31?  I was easily playing Counter-Strike for like four years with people all over the globe.  Yeah, play Counter-Strike now and look at the game they have out now. 
[00:30:00]  Look at Call of Duty now.  Sure.  And then play Counter-Strike.  You won't be able to play it.  You won't be able to play the game because it's so fucking slow and so fucked up and so...  It's crazy.  There's people that still play Counter-Strike to this day.  I'm not saying...  I didn't say that.  I didn't say people are fucking lunatics and love playing stupid Counter-Strike.  I didn't say that.  I'm saying the difference between what you played then and what you played now is fucking...  It's crazy.  Yeah, but it's hard to be like a caveman dropped off nowadays who fucking have their mind blown by everything out there. 
[00:30:30]  I think it's just a little easier to be jaded when you've just had it in little spurts throughout your time.  So, you know, is holding an iPad amazing streaming shit from Netflix?  Crazy.  Yes, it is.  It's crazy.  But when you've rode that wave, you know, gradually in, you know, it doesn't hit you as hard as it probably should when you really think about it.  My grandfather was 100, and I asked him what the craziest technology he ever saw.  He said radio.  That was like he couldn't believe that somebody was actually somewhere else talking in his living room. 
[00:31:00]  So, I mean, it's all from where you're coming from, yeah.  But you grew up with a lot of cool technology.  But it's...  The fact that you have a TV in your bed that you can watch anything you really want to watch at any time is fucking nuts.  Yes, and you've done it in less than 10 years.  Less than 10 years.  Less than 5 years, actually.  Well, 5 years.  When did YouTube come?  I mean, dude, a plasma TV 5 years ago was like $80 million.  Now you have one on a pillow next to your head.  Well, I love how everybody, they love using the word cloud, and everything is in the cloud now. 
[00:31:30]  Well, I mean, I like, I'm sure most of America, or I hope at least, or probably the world,  has been emailing themselves shit so that they can have it wherever they are.  They've been doing this for 10 years.  Because all that is is the cloud, so I don't know why it's becoming a big deal now.  TVs...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Who do you want to go to?  Go to Rob.  Bobby's dumb.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  TVs didn't start 20 years ago.  Rob, you're on the air.  What's this?  Is this you?  Yeah, I just have to say, Bob, you have to pay attention to what you're saying you're being a dummy.  TVs 20 years ago only had 8 channels, so 20 years ago, 1992, you only had one TV with a TV with 8 channels? 
[00:32:00]  No.  First of all, dumb dumb, you get my point.  I was just saying shit.  I mean, back in the day, there was NBC, CBS, there was the networks, and then 50s...  Yeah, there was just a few channels.  The point is that we have 900 fucking channels now.  The average household has fucking crazy amount of channels.  I mean, you can stream HD video on demand. 
[00:32:30]  I mean, it is impressive.  Yeah, I mean, I wasn't being fucking...  20 years ago, I know that's stupid.  I know that.  I remember what I used to have to actually get up and change a channel.  I remember that.  Could you imagine?  But you don't understand when they made the remote, people were like, why do you need that?  You don't need that.  That's stupid.  Just get up and change the channel.  Imagine if that wasn't...  The same shit you said, why would you need this?  Why the fuck...  The same people that did that shit, if we didn't have a remote now, if they were like, you're right, we don't need this.  There's fucking 900 channels.  Changing the TV would suck. 
[00:33:00]  Just going...  You're an asshole.  Oh, I work for a cable company, so trust me, I hear shit all day.  Which one?  Cablevision, actually.  Bye.  Why?  I like Cablevision, Time Warner?  No, they're different.  The Cablevision is fucking...  I love Time Warner, the new Time Warner I just got, the new shit.  No, you don't.  No one's ever said that.  I've never heard anybody...  I got the new, the fucking expensive, crazy shit that they have, the concierge. 
[00:33:30]  Oh, that's when you pay so much that it actually works, the way it's supposed to be.  Here's what's great about it, is 24 hours a day, I just call up and somebody answers the phone.  Good.  And they know who I am and they know my account.  Oh, they don't give that to us guys.  I don't fucking...  I don't deal with waiting and getting that lady, hello, this is Claire Reeves.  Do you want your cable to actually work?  I guess $300 a month.  The internet speed is fucking off the charts.  Oh, with that.  It's fucking crazy.  I'm sure it is.  Off the charts.  I don't have Fios, I don't have problems.  Fios is great, but this actually, it's not as good as Fios, but it's up there. 
[00:34:00]  It's not as shitty as regular cable.  Well, I mean, I had the regular Time Warner situation when I was living in Queens, and  I mean, you're just...  It is a monopoly.  I mean, there's really not much you could do.  It's either that or you've got to get satellite.  That's it.  Go to Steve in Ohio.  I want to hear what this guy has to say.  Steve, what's up, man?  Hey, how's it going?  Bobby, I think you're completely right to swoon a little bit over strength.  And what Danny, before he shits all over it, like one of those pictures for strings...  Just let him finish.  Just let him finish.  Just let him put up, it's a shoe, and it allows you to look at it from three dimensions.  So think about sitting at home with a catalog for a car, furniture, whatever, a one-dimensional 
[00:34:30]  picture.  You bring your phone up, you can look at a three-dimensional image of a car, a TV, a sofa, a chair.  Exactly.  Okay.  So in the future.  I think the technology is great.  Steve, Steve, Steve.  Let me ask you a question.  Is that what the app is now?  But what the...  No, it's not.  It's a fucking dragon that you could look at.  No, they have a shoe on there.  Did you see the shoe?  Bring up the shoe.  Bring up the shoe.  You know what he's saying?  All you are showing me a fucking...  You're going, hey, look at this beta app.  When this app becomes real in four years, this is going to be the shit. 
[00:35:00]  What I'm saying is that real world applications right now, it's not there.  No, you're saying...  You didn't say that.  You're saying, what am I going to need that for in the future?  No, I said...  That's what you said.  No, what I said was, why do I need this on my phone?  And if I download this app called String, so I could look at the dragon a thousand times...  We're not saying that you need it now.  We're not saying you need it now, dum-dum.  We're saying that...  We need some hair-splitting thing where he's shitting all over it.  Listen, stop one second, Danny.  I would like for the dragon to talk.  Go up.  Go back.  Go to the next one.  I love how you think you know me so well, Steve.  I'd just like to know what I'm supposed to do with this app today. 
[00:35:30]  If I download this app today, where can I use this app besides this website?  No, you should appreciate it for what it could be.  It is.  It's very cool.  But what can I use it for right now?  What can I use it for right now besides...  Excuse me.  Excuse me, Steve.  What can I use it for right now?  Fucking Danny, don't do that shit.  I want to know.  Don't do that shit.  Don't fucking...  He's trying to tell you...  I can watch the demo over and over again.  You're doing the same thing.  Don't talk over somebody.  What are you saying?  No one's letting me talk.  Because nobody's saying that right now you need it. 
[00:36:00]  Nobody said that.  We're saying in the future this is going to be the shit.  This is an app that I would download.  I'd play with it for 10 minutes, and then it would be deleted off my phone.  Right the fuck now, but later on, later on, exactly what he's saying.  When I want to go to fucking B&H, how big is...  What does this fucking look like?  What is this mixing board?  How does this mic look?  I'm going to be able to take this fucking app and go into that system and scroll over the actual thing  and look and see what a pair of jeans or a hat or a shoe or whatever the fuck it is actually looks like in real life 
[00:36:30]  and go all the way around it and see what the sole looks like and the top of it inside the shoe.  I never said this wasn't cool.  What I did say was that I don't give a fuck about a 3D dragon busting out the wall.  That's what I don't care about.  Do you think Danny's poo-pooing?  He's going to be the same thing when they said, fuck the iPad, fuck this, fuck that.  He's going to be the guy going, dude, look at this app.  They've got a string catalog.  Exactly.  He's going to be that guy.  Danny was going, who's ever going to want to have a printer in their house? 
[00:37:00]  No, I was showed...  You know what?  Danny's getting mad.  Don't get mad.  It's just the...  Because I go...  I say three words and then it's...  So what I was going to say is maybe perhaps a better way to show this to somebody is if  there actually was products that you could show to somebody.  So you think the technology's stupid?  Yes, that's exactly what I said.  Steve, that's what I said.  Thanks very much.  This technology will never take off.  I think 3D modeling is retarded.  Dude, I can twist that knob on the TV.  He did.  You really are a fucking old fogey.  I'm not an old fogey. 
[00:37:30]  It's...  Good.  That's what you needed to do.  All right, go to Jason in California.  He wants to tell you what you can do with the app.  Just go...  I don't know.  What's so...  What is hysterical over there?  I just think it's all funny.  It's very funny.  It's very funny.  I like when Danny gets heated...  You get so angry so fast.  You get very...  I mean, I have...  Because I just try to...  Because people don't want to...  I just want to explain my point.  And then people just want to...  They don't even let me get it out.  Like, I don't care if you agree with it or not.  I'm just...  My point is that it's fucking dumb.  I'm a dragon busting out the wall. 
[00:38:00]  And then the minute somebody else has another opinion, it's just like, oh, well, here's  why you're retarded.  You're retarded because...  Wait a minute.  You guys did the same shit to me with my website, and you let in nine calls that agreed with  your point.  So fuck you, you fucking one-way.  That's completely different.  No one else is it.  Yeah, we're right about your website.  That's the thing.  All right.  Jesse in Seattle.  What do you want?  I think it's very cool.  Jesse.  Jason.  Yeah, hey.  Oh, you went to Jesse.  Yeah, an augmented reality app with a piano where you print out a picture of a piano, 
[00:38:30]  the keys, and then you aim your phone at it, and you can actually play the piano.  That's pretty cool.  It puts notes through your phone.  Boom.  Go fuck yourself, Danny.  You know what that still is?  That's cool.  That's not having a piano and then having a fucking piano.  You're a fucking idiot.  And then what'd you say?  He said that's not cool?  No, he said that's cool.  We said it's cool.  Uh-huh.  Jesus.  No, Jerry, we said it's cool.  Jesse.  There's a difference between cool and what's practical, and I just thought, I don't think  that something like that is practical.  Are the headphones on at all with this fucking show? 
[00:39:00]  Listen, Jesse.  He's gone.  He hung up.  I don't like that he got fucking snapped on somebody.  I have piano on my phone, though.  Yeah, but the fact, okay, here it is.  Think about this.  Oh, you are gay.  Here's the thing.  Imagine having no piano in your house.  How many times do you use that app?  It's for my daughter.  Are you really?  It's cat piano.  Imagine having a piano in your house on this augmented reality.  It's there.  You can play it, and then you shut the app off, and it's fucking gone.  That's crazy.  Okay.  Let me try to explain a little better my feelings about this. 
[00:39:30]  No one's saying that it's not cool.  You know what's cool, too?  When webcams came out 15 years ago, and you could have a still frame every second.  That's cool.  That's cool.  Is it full motion video?  No.  Right.  And that's where we're at with this kind of stuff.  This is like that single frame webcam, and in five years, when the technology gets to  where it really needs to be, it will be cool.  That's what I'm saying.  But right now, it's just like, oh, neat, oh.  It's not just fucking, oh.  It's amazing that there's a fucking dragon coming out of a computer screen with no dragon. 
[00:40:00]  I'm tired of this dragon.  All right, listen.  I'm not talking about the dragon anymore.  Here's something that I think that you might like, that I think is cool, that I actually  thought of you, because you were kind of working in this, you were trying to get a business  going with this.  Is this the thing you want for free?  It's Seagate.  Seagate hard drive.  You know it's Seagate.  Sure, yeah.  Seagate hard drives are my favorite hard drives.  If I love, especially if you have Mac, they just work well with Mac, they have this new  thing out that actually, it's 500 gigabyte, and you, it's 500 gigabytes, and you can put 
[00:40:30]  all your movies on it, all your music, all this shit on it, but it has its own Wi-Fi  signal.  So, and it can have up to, I believe, eight devices.  It's either three or eight devices, or four or eight devices, can hook into it at the same  time, but watch different shit.  So if we're all hanging out at your house or whatever, you can, like me and my wife, my wife  can watch something on her iPad, and I can watch something on the TV, on my computer,  two different movies at the same time off the same fucking device.  I can do that at my house.  But you made that. 
[00:41:00]  Kind of.  You made that.  This is actually a small little device from Seagate now that has, you can put all your  porn, all your movies, all your bullshit on it, and it sends out its own Wi-Fi signal,  and more than one person can actually jump on it.  This is very cool.  Yeah.  That thing is cool, right?  Yeah.  It'd be great for you, too, because here's the thing.  That was it.  This is very cool.  Well, you have a kid, and you're married, so your kid can be watching a cartoon video,  and you can be jerking off to your fucking scat porn in the other room. 
[00:41:30]  Okay, well, that's...  And your chick could be watching fucking Bravo TV.  So this has to come with some kind of, I guess, software?  Like, how do you browse what's on that drive?  Like, if I'm on my iPad, I want to figure out what's on that drive?  It comes up, I believe it comes up as a hard drive on your device.  Oh, yeah, that's it?  Yeah, and you can pick from it.  That's fucking...  And it's not huge.  Look how small it is.  You have it in a car.  And so keep all...  Now, especially for iPad, the thing about iPad is the hard drive isn't that big, really. 
[00:42:00]  You can keep...  Oh, I see.  Okay, so you can plug that into a cigarette lighter in your car.  Is that what you're saying?  It's got its own battery, so it's wireless.  It's got its own...  That can't possibly last very long.  Five hours.  Five hours.  That's pretty good.  It's not bad.  That's great.  That's fucking great.  It's better than those mini projectors that they try to sell you for the iPhones and the Pico projectors that aren't there yet.  Their batteries are literally an hour, so you can't watch a full movie on the fucking day.  I like stuff like this because you can take your media everywhere in your house.  I like to be able to...  What I can do in my house, if I'm watching an old episode of Seinfeld or whatever, I can just pause it, be like, I have to take a crap now, go into the bathroom, and then just continue playing where I left off on either my iPad or my phone. 
[00:42:30]  It doesn't matter.  Look at all these motherfuckers calling up, too.  Go to Don in Ohio.  He's talking about it.  Is that Don on the phone?  Yeah, that's me.  Hello.  Hey, there was a video put out on YouTube from Corning, and it basically...  Describes everything that you guys were talking about.  Yes. 
[00:43:00]  Yeah, we just described it and gave the website.  And you can actually buy it right now.  It's called Seagate Drive.  So there's an app that you...  So you download an app on your iPad.  Right.  And then you just access through it.  That's fucking...  That's just brilliant.  That's fucking great.  Awesome.  This is the...  And I love the size of it, too, that it's not too big.  Well, you know what?  I mean, the size physically, yeah, but you know what?  500 gigs for my application is too small.  I don't need eight of those things.  Really?  Yeah.  I have two gigs that are completely... 
[00:43:30]  I don't have more space.  I need to upgrade and get a real server now.  Well, again, here's the thing is that I think that this is the first one.  And look, if you go to Seagate and you go to the other drives that they have, they have  a terabyte that's the size of a credit card almost.  Yeah.  So, as this comes out, I'm sure this will get micro, micro.  That's what they do is just micro shit.  The only problem I've ever experienced with these small, like, portable drives is that  they do fail.  Really?  Yeah, they do.  Now, I'm not saying that Seagates fail all the time.  I'm not saying that at all.  But I have noticed that, you know, because they're just really... 
[00:44:00]  All these things really are is, like, laptop drives that are in a pretty shiny case.  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah.  So, you know, those laptop drives fail just as much as any other kind of drive.  So, especially something like this where you're constantly throwing it around and racking it.  I actually, I set it up at my house now.  I have the Apple wireless fucking thing, whatever the fuck.  Apple TV?  No, I have Apple TV and LV TV, but I have the wireless router now.  The airport?  Airport Extreme.  I got the Extreme, and I put a...  It has one USB thing in the back, but if you put a USB hub into that, you can put in 
[00:44:30]  up to four or five hard drives that will wirelessly be on your network.  So, I have, you know, like two Seagate drives, a three terabyte Seagate drive.  I have one Westin Digital terabyte, the little ones, and I hook everything up, and I back  everything up to the main big three terabyte Seagate drive.  Yeah, I mean, what you could do, like, for something like, if you have a lot of media  like that, something that I would reckon, like, you can get, like, a fucking big, like,  a rock store makes a good, like, hot swappable, like, six terabyte, eight terrible hot swappable. 
[00:45:00]  That's a fucking great, that's a fucking great...  Well, so you can just rip drives out, yeah, and just fucking throw them in, take new ones,  throw them in, and that way, that's, like, your main station, and you can just have everything  in your house pulling from this main, this mainframe, really, and that's, like, the real  way to go about doing stuff.  When I go, like, when I go on the road, I, I, this fucking Seagate thing is great for  me, because I can only store so much shit on my iPad, you know, and I hate having to 
[00:45:30]  fucking take stuff on, take stuff, I hate that shit.  Can this play, like, any, any type of video file?  Like?  Like, if I throw something on my iPad, it's gotta be, you know, M4V, or, you know?  That's a good question, dude.  But, like, if I can stream, you know, like, an MPEG video...  Or MKV, like, I know, I know Apple TV doesn't play MKV files, and MKV is, is really a great,  a great storage solution, because they're so, they're so compressed, and you don't lose  any quality, man.  I'm sure you'll be able to, I'm sure you'll be able to fucking jailbreak it to play anything 
[00:46:00]  you want, right?  And I'm sure the app, I don't know, that's a good question, I don't know.  Because there are apps on the iPad where I can stream any sort of media from my computer.  Right.  You know, so I'm wondering if this does it.  This is really cool.  Yeah, it's really cool, because you can throw it in the car, too.  Especially if you have a kid.  Yeah, but you need a Wi-Fi signal.  It has it.  No.  He's saying that it's built in.  It's built in.  You connect to the drive, not your router.  It has its own Wi-Fi signal, dude.  That's what he's saying.  It's called a GoFlex.  It has its own fucking Wi-Fi.  Yeah, dude, you're connecting to the drive, you're not connecting to a router. 
[00:46:30]  You're connecting to the drive.  If you're not connecting to something that's at your house, that's on the device.  Look at his face.  You saw his face just drop?  This is awesome.  It's the shit.  All of a sudden, those long drives are going to be a little shorter, huh?  And they were going to actually hook me up with one, the people at Seagate.  What happened?  But then it just failed.  Why?  I don't know.  We're at the South by Southwest.  Yeah, we're going to woo and yeah.  And then it ended, and then that's it.  It's a wrap.  We'll send them this air check.  Here's the deal, though.  I still think this is probably one of the funnest, coolest gadgets that I want. 
[00:47:00]  So yeah, it's fucking great.  How much is it?  $199.  What?  That's not that bad.  That's actually not that bad.  How much would you pay, Bob?  I would pay nothing.  No, it's actually not that bad for that.  $172 on Amazon.  I mean, for a $500.  Yeah, it's fucking great.  I agree with Danny, though.  They could have probably put a terabyte.  Yeah, I mean, look.  Maybe they will.  Look, they don't want to price out.  What is that shit called?  What is that fucking...  Oh, God.  I forget what it's called.  It's... 
[00:47:30]  Fuck.  I mean, what is a terabyte?  Planned opulence is what that is.  I think you're talking about pre-planned obsolescence?  No, that's planned opulence.  The terabyte drive they had is 10 times smaller than that right there.  They could have put a terabyte drive in that.  They should have.  But that's going to be the next one, which it should have been now.  Yeah, but they also don't want to price people out.  Like, how much is a terabyte drive right now?  Like, a hundred bucks?  No.  Probably.  It's nothing.  It's really cheap right now. 
[00:48:00]  You could have thrown...  And their terabyte drive has the Thunderbolt in it now, where you can...  Which is great.  The Thunderbolt is speedy, speedy, speedy.  This is cool.  Yeah, it's fucking...  It's really good.  Why do I keep saying fucking?  I apologize.  Yeah, especially when you're talking about a professional product like this.  Why?  This guy said, I stopped using Seagate for work because what?  What does it say?  Work they suck?  Really?  I find that not to be true.  Len, you got something else to say?  Oh, absolutely.  I build the video DVRs, security DVRs for a living. 
[00:48:30]  And when the Seagate were made in Thailand up until about three years ago, they were fine.  But since they went to China, I have a 64% failure rate of Seagate.  I don't know the legitimacy of those numbers, but we'll have to take your word for it.  Oh, no, absolutely.  And then when you do send it back, they give you like a three-year warranty.  They send you a refurb product to take its place one time, and those fail after about six months.  Hey, Len.  Hey, Len.  I'm trying to get a free Seagate.  Want to fucking settle down on your stats?  Why don't you mind your business and stop cock-blocking me from good tech? 
[00:49:00]  I can't tell you the boxes and boxes of Dead Seagate I take to the recyclers.  Why don't you send me one over?  You ever get one of these GoFlex?  Yeah, this guy, there's a guy on Feedback.  He really, he's got the right plan here.  He says you can jailbreak the Apple TV and install XBMC on it to support MKV files.  But XBMC on a dedicated machine is always going to be better.  And he's right.  And you just lost everybody listening, as can be.  He didn't lose me, and that's who he's talking to.  I'll tell you. 
[00:49:30]  Basically, what he's saying is you get a machine, and that computer is just dedicated to running shit, you know, just running shit.  You're all your media.  I've had Apple TV for like over a year, and I'm like, oh, I don't want to jailbreak it.  But it costs fucking $99.  Like, what's going to happen if it goes wrong?  I'm going to spend another $99.  Jailbreak it.  You can un-jailbreak it.  Yeah, I really should jailbreak it because, like, half the movies that I download, you know, I've got to handbrake them anyway to put them into the format that Apple supports.  What's the benefits of jailbreaking your Apple TV?  You can play any file.  You can play any movie file. 
[00:50:00]  You can play an MKV.  You can play an M4V.  You can play an AVI.  You can play an M4V.  Yeah, but where would you get – I mean, does it come up with a site that you can go and get those?  Well, let's say, for instance, like, if somebody like me possibly might not want to pay for a movie, and maybe I just download it for free on the internet.  Onto your computer.  Onto my computer.  And then you go from your Apple TV from your computer to your Apple TV.  Yeah, then you throw it into iTunes and stream it through iTunes.  But the point is that iTunes only supports a specific type of file.  Gotcha.  So if it's not that type of file, I've got to throw it into a program called Handbrake. 
[00:50:30]  And convert it.  And convert it, and that's almost in real time.  Yeah, dude, that's a fucking major pain.  Which, again, when they invented Handbrake, people were like, oh, my God, dude, you can take regular – and now it's just horseshit.  And now it's like, oh, my God, a two-hour movie is going to take two hours?  Horseshit to Danny.  But listen.  But so if you jailbreak it, you don't have to worry about that.  You can just play whatever type of file you want.  So I really should jailbreak it.  I mean, I jailbroke my phone, and to be honest with you, the amazing one I first did it, I don't really use the shit I got.  A phone's a different thing because I can't afford – 
[00:51:00]  If something, God forbid, goes wrong with the phone and it's jailbroken, I can't afford a new phone.  I can afford another $100.  Well, you're very special.  I have just another iPhone.  You just got it lying around.  It's actually in a bookshelf.  I think it's in the bookshelf.  Who needs it?  Yeah.  But, yeah, I jailbroke it.  It's cool, and I've got all this cool stuff that I can do with it.  But the one thing that I do like is that I can apply attachments to my emails now on my iPhone.  Yeah.  Which is pretty bad.  Yeah, that's pretty cool.  I don't like having to go to photos.  I don't know why they still do that. 
[00:51:30]  Yeah, that's dumb.  It makes no sense.  That's dumb.  So I might jailbreak my Apple TV.  But this new Seagate thing I think is great.  I don't believe Len.  I think those stats are wrong.  There you go.  I think he works for Western Digital.  Got a call on the old hotline.  I don't know who it is, though, because it's not been screened yet.  Here we go.  I don't know who it is.  I'm just going to hit it.  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  Hello?  You're on the air? 
[00:52:00]  Oh, God.  Are you serious?  Who's on the hotline in there, you guys?  Who's answering the phone?  What is this?  What is this?  This is a fucking joke?  No, they said you got to it before he could talk to whoever was on the line.  Who is it?  Who is it?  Who was it supposed to be?  Ah, fuck this.  All right, goodbye.  Go to the top one.  Doesn't matter anymore.  Ray in Dallas.  Now it's Ray.  Hey, how's it going, guys?  No, I just wanted to tell that Bobby, I'm like you.  I've gotten rid of my laptop, and I'm just going with my iPad now.  And like, for example, Apple, everything you buy on there, now you can just re-download 
[00:52:30]  if you delete it.  Like, Ellison in the room, I bought it like three months ago.  And when they updated it, I was able to re-download it whenever I want to.  Now it's pretty cool.  And now you can stream movies.  And you can stream movies.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's great.  All badass.  Yeah, good.  I mean, I still have a MacBook, because you can't write a script.  Yeah, you need it for work.  Yeah, I mean, they have script writing stuff for iPad, and I've used it, but it's not good  to...  It's really not good to... 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, like, I could probably do the show prep that I do for this show in pages.  Yeah.  But it would take longer.  It's going to get easier.  Copy and paste and stuff like that still isn't where it's easier for me to do it on the iPad.  Yeah, plus they still don't have Flash on the fucking iPad, which is stupid.  I can live without it.  Wow.  But I still have a computer.  I have a MacBook.  I just can't wait to...  I want to take...  I can't wait to the MacBook Air and the MacBook Join, you know, that every...  They should have solid state drives.  They shouldn't have regular hard drives anymore. 
[00:53:30]  Every computer should have a solid state drive.  What's that?  A solid state drive is...  No moving parts.  Yeah, no moving parts.  So when you open up a program, GarageBand or whatever, it just opens a lot faster.  Sure.  And, you know, there's no spinning, all that bullshit.  I hate fucking regular hard drives in computers.  Yeah, you know, my very first MP3 player, it's got to be easily eight years old, nine  years old at this point, and there's an actual spinning platter hard drive inside.  Really?  Yeah.  You should take that out, make a necklace out of it, like a tech neck. 
[00:54:00]  It was cool, though, because this was, like, way...  Dude, this was, like, probably 2003.  Right.  And I think the iPods that were available back then, it was, like, maybe four and eight.  Maybe 16 was, like, the top, the tippity-toppity-top.  Yeah.  My second-generation iPod is an eight gig.  I had this fucking thing.  I had to explain to everybody when I got it what it was.  This thing was an Arcos, and no one's heard of that brand.  Arcos stinks.  Yeah, they really do.  But it was a 20 gig MP3 player, and for 2003 or two or whatever, that was the shit. 
[00:54:30]  You know, Keith Robinson...  That was the shit.  ...loved Arcos.  He kept going...  When the iPad came out, he was like, fuck that, man.  Arcos, man.  Arcos.  Arcos is the shit.  He called me around six months ago, I got an iPad.  It's the best thing I ever got, man.  Fucking Arcos.  Yeah.  Fuck Arcos.  You know, they had a lot of great ideas, but they never really executed any of them very well.  I used to have a wizard.  Remember the wizard?  No, what is that?  It was just...  You just put your phone numbers in...  I'm the wizard.  No one can beat me.  It was a little mini computer, and you opened it up...  You know what the wizard was? 
[00:55:00]  Jerry got his dad a Willard.  Oh, is that what we're talking about?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  That's exactly what it was.  Yeah.  I remember...  I had...  When you first...  These first started coming out with these computer things, you put just a phone number  and a name, and that's where you kept all your numbers.  Because the phone didn't have...  When you had cell phones, it didn't have the memory to store people's numbers.  Remember when they first came out?  Kind of.  How old are you guys?  Jesus Christ.  Kind of.  Well, Travis just turned 31.  Happy birthday.  Thanks.  All right.  Let's wrap this up, man. 
[00:55:30]  I thought you had more of a story.  I got nothing.  I just bailed out with the fucking Travis is 31.  An intern walks in, and you go, all right, let's wrap up the show.  Well, these interns are like fucking...  We still have time.  Fringe aliens.  Yeah.  Eric says we still have two minutes.  They fucking come in, and they don't say anything.  Let's plug Bobby's gigs, man.  I mean, Bobby's going to be at the brokerage.  You're coming.  You guys are coming.  Absolutely.  Yes.  I'm excited.  He's going to be at brokerage in Belmore, Long Island.  Belmore, Long Island.  One show Friday, and two shows Saturday.  Eight o'clock Friday, and eight and 10.30 on Saturday. 
[00:56:00]  Saturday is selling out.  Friday is a good...  Actually, there's a...  It's a small club, but it's a great club.  I like it.  Go to Robert Kelly.  Well, actually, don't go to Robert Kelly.  Yeah, because you'll never find the dates.  You won't figure out how to buy the tickets.  Listen, I think we started out a little rough today.  You guys were in attack mode, and I didn't like it, and my feelings got hurt.  I think we were in help mode.  Hang on.  But you don't help.  See, all you got to do, if you want Bobby's dates, you just got to go to his website, take out your phone.  It's got this little app, and there's like a little blue dot, and then you line up your phone.  How great would that be?  To his website, and then the dates appear, and that's easier. 
[00:56:30]  And then you pop out, and you start saying your dates.  And then you know what the coolest thing is?  Is that you can go all the way around Bobby as he's telling you his dates.  Here's the deal.  Here's the fucking deal.  Here's the deal.  I wish I did have fucking string on my...  That would be great fucking website.  You should license it.  You can buy it.  RobertKelleyLive.com.  It's not that complicated.  It's actually...  You have to scroll down for one second to see my dates.  I'm actually...  This week, but I'm going to Reno next week.  So if any fans of this show, or the Opie and Anthony show, are in Reno, please come. 
[00:57:00]  I'm there for fucking seven nights in Reno.  Seven nights?  Tuesday, Wednesday...  Wow.  Not seven, but Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.  I'm at this fucking place.  One show a night, and I'm nervous.  I've never been to Reno, but...  I've never been either.  The only place I haven't really been in the Union.  And when I say Union, I mean the States.  Well, I guess that's about it for this piece of shit today.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  Go to Riotcast.com.  Check out the podcast.  When are you guys going to come on?  When are you guys... 
[00:57:30]  You guys should come over and do the show.  Yeah, it'll be fun.  It's just, you know what?  We're not Manhattanites, so, you know...  We like to...  Ooh, what the fuck?  It takes me an hour and a half to get in the city.  Sorry, my train of thought just completely got derailed.  Manhattanites.  I love the amount of ass that just comes out of the woodwork.  The second there's a nice day, it's just amazing.  It's like I'm 13 again.  Thank you, man.  I like seeing what fucking lights the phone up, you know?  They won't fucking do shit.  And all of a sudden, you mention one thing, and it's good.  Bye.  Take care.  Ron and Fez up next!  The O.P. and Anthony show is now over. 
[00:58:00]  For real this time.  Check out the O&A show on Facebook at Facebook.com slash O.P. and Anthony.  And catch O.P. and Anthony live Monday through Friday from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern.  Ron and Fez are next.  Hey!  Hey! </pre>
