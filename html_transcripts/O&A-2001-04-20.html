<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast, airing on a Friday, heavily featured the 420 holiday, with numerous callers sharing their intoxicated celebrations and participating in a "Stoner Spelling Bee."  The hosts discussed the holiday's origins and the alleged California police code connection.  They also discussed Hayseed Dixie, a hillbilly AC/DC tribute band, whose lead singer had been interviewed the previous day.  The show played several highly offensive songs, including parodies referencing the Columbine massacre and Hitler, preceded by warnings.  Controversial topics included Rosie O’Donnell’s adoptions, allegations against Michael Jackson and Al Sharpton involving slave trading, and a caller's story about a woman inserting a chicken into her vagina to conceive.  A purported pot reference in *Pulp Fiction* was also mentioned.  Listeners called in with various anecdotes about adoptions, often involving unexpected racial or ethnic backgrounds of adopted children. Psycho Mark, calling from Jamaica, provided a colorful, likely drug-influenced account of his 420 celebrations.  Extensive discussion surrounded Rosie O’Donnell's sexuality and numerous adoptions, fueled by caller speculation.  The show’s ratings were analyzed, with Opie and Anthony acknowledging a decline but highlighting continued success in specific demographics.  They also discussed contract negotiations and the possibility of moving to internet radio.  Several heated exchanges occurred with callers regarding the show's ratings and comparisons to other programs, including "Radio Chick."  The broadcast ended with a humorous segment on the versatility of the word "fuck."  Sponsorships included Sam Adams beer and Optimum Online, along with repeated promotion of the "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest."  

Comedian Jay Moore, in studio after appearing on *Regis and Kelly*, participated in a highly vulgar and offensive conversation.  A caller, Marco, graphically detailed being molested by his gym and social studies teachers, prompting discussions about sexual experiences and accusations of inappropriate behavior. The segment also included advertisements for various products (limousines, Hyundai, Home Depot grills), promotion of Jay Moore's stand-up show and the whipped cream bikini contest, and movie reviews (criticizing *Freddy Got Fingered*).  Numerous celebrities (Al Green, Drew Barrymore, Michael Jackson) were discussed.

A significant portion focused on Michael Jackson and allegations of child molestation, employing highly offensive and sexually suggestive language.  Igor, claiming to be an actor on *The Sopranos*, engaged in a rambling conversation with limited English proficiency.  Another caller defended Michael Jackson, leading to further discussion of the allegations. O.J. Simpson and his trial were also discussed using racially charged and insensitive language.  The "Whipped Cream Bikini Contest" was again promoted. The show maintained its characteristic chaotic and highly improvisational style throughout, with frequent interruptions and tangents.  Opie also mentioned a dispute with a sponsor over a promised free gym membership and listener complaints about previously aired content, including the offensive songs.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Hopi and Anthony.  I can't stumble.  We can't want these people to reproduce.  How do you see no class?  In the workplace.  I'll never work in this town again.  That's disgusting.  How do they let this on the air?  We suck.  Everyone hates us.  Child.  1027.  WNEW.  Friday.  Friday. 
[00:00:30]  I can't see your appointments.  Hey, what would carbon sound like that?  You guys, I'm so lost right now. 
[00:01:00]  Can I get a cookie?  Can I get a cookie?  Can I get a cookie?  I want a cookie.  Can I get a cookie?  Can I get a cookie?  Can I get a cookie?  Oh, sweet.  Everything looks good.  What do you got?  Passery and particles.  I'm so hot.  I feel like I'm floating.  What are you people? 
[00:01:30]  On the show?  I got sort of a kind of light.  What the hell were you thinking?  More weed every day.  Stay out the bushes. 
[00:02:00]  Stay out.  It's the O&A Show.  212-757-1027.  Yeah, it's FU Friday.  It's some kind of holiday.  It's all sorts of things all wrapped into one.  The holiday?  Yeah, it's the 420 holiday, Anthony.  Oh, oh, it's the stoner new year. 
[00:02:30]  I hear.  Is that true?  Because it's the fourth month, the 20th day.  April 20th, 420.  And, of course, 420, everyone knows.  Time to light up.  Something tells me, though, your stoners aren't waiting until 420 to light up.  Smoke weed every day.  Well, they've been smoking all day.  Right.  It's the day, 420.  But then at 420, it puts it into a whole different level.  Right.  And then with the day being 420. 
[00:03:00]  Mike, what's going on?  Happy holiday, guys.  Yeah?  Ooh.  Yeah, they were talking about marijuana legalization on the hardball yesterday.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I just don't effing care anymore.  I'm just going to go light up in a few minutes anyway.  When are you playing stoner spelling day?  We're thinking of playing that today.  Seems like there's enough of you out there smoking weed.  Smoking, yeah.  Too bad.  I think I might call you back when I'm enlightened on the ganja.  All right, cool.  All right.  Bye.  My ganja.  If we're going to play, we've got to play with, like, you know, some people that are just out of their minds. 
[00:03:30]  We need real people that are, like, really stoned.  Right.  Intense.  As stoned as Psycho Mark was yesterday when he called from Jamaica.  What are you people?  On dope?  Leave it to Psycho Mark to be there for 420.  420 Tours brought him there.  I know.  Joe, what's going on?  Yo, happy 420.  Hey, man.  Happy 420.  Gotta go.  What are you doing, man? 
[00:04:00]  Pretty stoned?  Yeah.  You didn't go to work today?  No.  It's a holiday, Opie.  Why would he go to work?  Oh, yeah.  It's such a...  It's a special day.  Holiday is this.  Tell us why it's so special, Joe.  Because we get to light up for a reason.  For a reason.  Unlike every other day where you light up for no reason.  You got me there.  Oh, no, Joe.  All right, Joe. 
[00:04:30]  Thank you.  You know, we were going to celebrate this fine day today with Willie Nelson.  I know.  Which would have been a natural.  Talking about a guy that likes his pot.  Guy smoking all the time.  He was supposed to stop by, but, I don't know, something happened.  He's going to reschedule?  They're definitely going to do it next time he's in town.  Next time he's in town, that could be another year.  He could be dead by then.  Oh.  Two months.  Willie doesn't have that many years left.  Anthony.  Yeah, guys, the whole 420 thing? 
[00:05:00]  Yeah.  And it's the cop code for pot smokers.  Wow, thank you.  I never would have known that.  Yeah, when they hunt someone who's got, they're smoking up or selling, they radio each other with 420.  We have a 420 over at such and such a street or whatever, an apartment.  So, that's the whole thing with 420.  And everyone found out, and now they celebrate it.  Now, what state is that, um, uh, the police code for?  I think it's in California. 
[00:05:30]  That's where it all started out.  All right.  Um, a little information for you guys.  Well, thank God it fit on somewhere on the clock.  It wasn't like a 187.  We'd be screwed.  All right, Anthony.  Thanks, guys.  I think we've got to just slow down the slowdown.  Oh, do a gag for Peter and Anthony's show.  Take a few ride, gang. 
[00:06:00]  420, show me your booze.  Ha, ha, ha.  Yeah.  I hear an echo.  Someone get me some punch. 
[00:06:30]  Anthony.  I'm hearing an echo in my head.  It's in your imagination.  I'm so wasted.  Your face is melting. 
[00:07:00]  99, rabbit.  99.  Wow.  Hey, there you go.  Oh, somebody actually sent the origin of 420.  I think we just heard it.  Dave, what's going on?  Yo, check it.  I got a 40 bag of Northern Lights in my car.  I'm on 59th Street and 3rd Avenue right now. 
[00:07:30]  Cops just looked at me.  I'm going to bring it up to you guys if you want it.  I think he's putting two thumbs up, so come on by.  Northern Lights?  Northern Lights, baby.  Straight from Canada.  We're going to get messed up 420 style.  All right.  I think he's looking forward to your arrival.  All right.  Can I really come down?  Do you really want it?  I don't care.  I'll be there in a couple of minutes.  All right.  Later.  Bye.  420.  That's right.  San Rafael Police Department in Marin County in California to find a 420 radio call. 
[00:08:00]  It's pot smoking in Broadway.  There you go.  That's the origin of 420.  Mm-hmm.  Kelly, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey.  It's 420.  We got a ton of people over here.  We're just sitting and smoking all day.  It's like a big party out there.  Why bother doing a show?  You guys aren't going to remember anything today.  No, we're listening. 
[00:08:30]  Yeah?  Yeah, all day.  How's it sounding so far?  Good.  You can understand everything we're doing?  Yeah, I can understand it.  Right on.  You want to play some of that Stoner Spelling Bee a little later?  Definitely.  All right.  We'll try to set that up very soon.  Cool.  We got some cool words today, Ben.  All right.  Dude, how cool does this sound?  In the place in Marion County where this started, 420, the new year, they gather together and  throw Frisbees, get together in drum circles, and the park rangers that patrol the site, 
[00:09:00]  they're cool.  They're cool?  They're cool with it.  So it's like a whole day where you can just smoke some weed, play some hacky sack.  I like that hacky sack.  The man's not going to hassle you.  How cool is that?  I still enjoy a game of hacky sack.  Nice.  Let's go to Jillian.  Jillian, what's going on?  Hi, guys.  Happy 420.  Happy 420, man.  What's up?

Go ahead.  There you go.  You know the song by Bob Dylan, Rainy Day Woman?  Yes.  It's Rainy Day Woman 12 times 35.  Right.  If you multiply them together, that's the 420.  Oh, stop.  There you go.  Everyone must get stoned, baby.  All right.  Thank you, Dan.  No problem, bro.  Did you play that today, Ben, on your little Black Crows?  You played the Black Crows version, right? 
[00:17:00]  Well, we gotta acknowledge a couple other things, too, today.  Got a couple songs that are very, very offensive.  Oh.  Well, very offensive.  So if you're easily offended, turn off your radio right now.  We're warning you ahead of time.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We're just acknowledging it.  Well, that's, um, we're not condoning by any means.  What they're saying.  Well, it was two years ago today that, uh, that horrible shooting occurred in Columbine. 
[00:17:30]  Yeah.  Just waiting for something to happen.  Something always happens on, uh, this date, April 20th.  Right.  It's always something.  Isn't it Hitler's birthday, too?  Well, yeah.  How about that?  We have a song to, uh, to, uh, acknowledge that as well, I think.  Mm-hmm.  Which one do you want to play first?  These are very offensive.  Sure they are.  Warning you now.  We understand.  All right?  Yeah.  Okay.  The anniversary of, uh, Columbine. 
[00:18:00]  I don't think you call it an anniversary when it's, uh, something horrific that happened,  though, right?  Yeah, it's an anniversary.  Yeah.  It's all means.  Okay.

Hey, Dylan  All right, Derek  Hey, man  You can hear anything you're saying over here  How we doing?  We're from New York Sports  So we wanted to tell Rick  All the Roydheads  Over there  That they can celebrate 422  It's allowed  New York Sports Club?  Yes, sir 
[00:30:30]  Still waiting for my membership  Oh, yeah  What are we working?  Your free membership?  Yeah  Well, you gotta meet us outside  We've been up and down the stairs  About five, six times today  No, I'm dead serious  I applied like two and a half months ago  I'm still waiting  And what's wrong?  What's wrong?  They can't come through for you?  I don't know what's going on  They want us to talk nice about them  They give us a free membership  I went down to my local New York Sports Club  I signed up  It's been two and a half months  I had to rejoin my old gym  Oh, man  I didn't think I was gonna call and get grilled  I'm a little hurt right now  I don't understand what else to do 
[00:31:00]  We've called and, you know  All right  I thought when you, you know  Someone gives you a free membership  They hook you up and take care of you  But  Hey  Too many questions right now  We just walked back up the stairs  Did you smell it coming back up?  I'm sorry I'm, like, taking this out on you  But I'm really frustrated  I don't know what else to do  I don't know  I can work it out for you  If you keep in touch with me  I mean, we were doing the live reads for New York Sports Clubs  And they figured they would hook Ant and I up with memberships 
[00:31:30]  I figure if you keep in touch with me  I can have that done for you  All right  Well, thanks, Derek  Hey, anytime  Hey, happy 420, guys  I hear your clubs are cool  But I wouldn't know  Because I'm still waiting  Hey, well, some of them are cool  Some of them are the gay bathhouses of the 90s  But we're not gonna talk about that right now  All right, Derek  Thank you  Hey, thank you, Owen  Hey, happy 420  Rick, hey, come by the gym  All right  I guess when we do live reads for them in the near future  I'll just make believe I work out there, I guess  There you go  Start up next week  And start up next week 
[00:32:00]  Well, I'm sure you'll get a membership  Lickety split  I'm trying to be nice  I don't know  I don't know what else to do, though  Why don't you join?  I've left messages and notes  Please call me  Tell me what's going on  No, no  If they're not gonna give it to me  Then I probably would join or find another club  But when someone gives you something for free  Right  You know, it's like, wow  This is a free membership to New York sports clubs  This is cool  And then you go to the local New York sports clubs  And I sign out all my paperwork 
[00:32:30]  And they're like, well, it has to go through the corporate office  You know, come back in a week  Came back in the end of the week  Nothing  Two weeks go by  Nothing  Three weeks go by  No one's calling me  So I leave a note  Please call me  Tell me what's going on  It's frustrating  I want to, like, start screaming right now  It's been two and a half months  And now they're gonna start live reads on the show again  Alright, I'll make believe I worked out there for you  I don't know what else to say  We like using the products that advertise on our show  Especially when there goes that account 
[00:33:00]  I don't know what else to do, though  That seems, a lot of times  You know, the perception I think the listeners get  Is that you're always looking to get the freebie  Of the sponsor  Me?  See, that's the perception that the people are gonna get out there  Because they don't hear the insides  And they don't see what goes on  And they just hear you  I'd be asking for more free stuff  Don't be a dick today  Well, I'll say  Because that's not what it's about  I'm just saying 
[00:33:30]  That's the way it's gonna be perceived  See, we have a pretty popular show  And, you know, when we talk about something  We're not getting things for free  Right  Alright  And if someone is gonna, you know, give you something  Say, hey, because you're doing such a good job for our company  You know, we know your time is valuable on the air  And the advertising is valuable  Here  Here  Be our guest  Here's a free membership  Be our guest  Be our guest  I never asked for a free membership  They gave it to us  That's the difference  So it's not like I'm sitting here like  Hey, you're advertising  I want a free membership 
[00:34:00]  I never asked for anything  I was just saying  And I don't want people to think I asked for things  Right  I was saying you should clear it up  Because  I tried  The perception is  I tried  I don't know what else to do  I've pretty much given up  I had to join my old gym  Because they wouldn't even let me work out there  Until  No, nothing  Taylor, what's going on?  Opie once again  Displaying those alligator arms  Lying for the free membership  At New York Sports Club  Taylor, get the wax out of yours 
[00:34:30]  I just explained, you know, what it's all about  Well, if they're not going to give it to you  Then screw them  Then don't do the live read  No, because they didn't even say  They're not giving it to me  They're like, well, we've got to wait for corporate  To, you know, approve this  You know, come back next week  And we'll see where we're at  That's where I'm going to go  Then they're waffling  Then they're waffling  And, you know, say, hey  We'll find somebody else  And we'll hook us up  Taylor, I already gave up  See, if I had short arms  I would, like, not be working out  I went back to my old gym  Where I'm paying to work out  So, as far as being cheap 
[00:35:00]  And, you know, trying to get something for free  I guess I did not do that  All right  Thank you  Later  And they're advertising next week?  Uh-oh  I'll tell you a funny thing  Robert, who was the guy  Who was supposed to have the Sobe girls that day  That we put on the air  And, oh, he pretended you were Rick  Comes down this morning  And he's like, you know  I'm really working on Ope's membership  And this was this morning  He's saying  Yeah, and he goes  They're starting live reads next week 
[00:35:30]  But see, this is the other thing  This is why I'm so frustrated  And it has nothing  You can call me cheap  I don't give a F  If it makes good radio  But besides that  I even asked Robert a month ago  I'm like, Robert  You know, New York Sports Club  Gave me a free membership  Here's the card  Here's the paperwork  I don't know what's going on  I've called them a bunch of times  I stopped at the local  New York Sports Clubs in my town  I can't get this done  Can you help me out?  That was about a month ago  Maybe a month and a half ago  He hasn't even come down  And talked to me about it  Uh-oh  So, I mean, on all levels 
[00:36:00]  It's frustrating  So, I gave up  And I went back to my old gym  My membership ended at the old gym  I'm back there  What's wrong with the old gym?  Not good?  Well, I heard great things  About New York Sports Clubs  Want to check it out?  More equipment and stuff  You know?  Hmm  Why are you laughing that bad?  I'm just laughing  Because Robert, too, told me today  How upset he was  About the last time  That we played a little joke  On him on the air  So, dude, that really wasn't that funny  You know?  I could have gotten screwed, you know?  Look, I'm not  I'm not trying to, you know 
[00:36:30]  Abuse them or anything  I'm just  I'm just giving the facts  I don't understand what happened  That's all  I could yell and scream  If you want  But I don't  I just don't understand  And I'm giving up  What?  What, Rick?  Robert, yesterday  He calls me  And he leaves me  This sappy message  It's Robert  You know  I'm real sorry  About that whole  Sobee thing  That didn't work out  And tell him  I'm still working on it for him  You know?  I'm still working 
[00:37:00]  The exact same thing  You said to me today  Are you guys  Going to hold that against me?  I would love it  It's like his feelings are hurt  Oh, yeah  Very hurt  I'm trying very hard here  And I get nothing but grief from you  I'm trying  So, I don't know  I guess, um  Well, Ann can't talk about New York sports clubs  Because he's not going  No  I ain't going  He's a home fitness man  So when they start their live reads 
[00:37:30]  We'll just make believe  It's the coolest clubs in New York, I guess  I'll, uh  We'll take their word for it  I'll do the read  Based on the merits  That they put forth in the copy  There you go  Take their word for it  We'll have to use the word  Supposedly  A lot  Supposedly  Allegedly  Right  Great  And then  Like the local gym saying  Well, it's, you know  It's corporate  You know  We don't know what to tell you  I'm like  Well, just have someone call me  And explain what's going on  That's all I want  Not even a phone call 
[00:38:00]  So  Michelle, what's up?  How could you guys play a song like that?  What song?  The Hitler song  We said it was offensive  I just got home  And I turned on the middle of a song  On Hitler about Jews  Yeah  You guys have no class  Uh, we warned you  That it was a horrible song  We understood that  Then why would you play it?  Huh?  To show some of the, um  Songs that are out there  To show that  These are, uh  Offensive songs?  Well, then you can say  You know, I'm Jewish  And I'm very apodic 
[00:38:30]  And I'll believe it  I mean  Hey, Michelle  What?  Did you hear what we just said?  We played it  And we prefaced playing it  By saying  I didn't hear that part  I was not alone  Well, then  But I'm an ex-clister  You guys are jerks  You gotta understand  The context of him  As she hangs up  You swat  I think she hung up on it  Oh, Anthony  Really busting those stereotypes apart, Michelle  Good job  What a C  Let's go to Jillian  Jillian  Hi, guys  Hi, what's up?  I called before  That girl just killed my buzz  You guys are cool  Don't even worry about it 
[00:39:00]  Smoke up more  Okay, well  I wanted to tell you  The names I have for my stuff  For what?  My bong  Okay  Okay, I have four names  I have one bong  That name is Smiley  I've used that, like, uh  Intimately with my boyfriend sometimes  It's quite fun  Then we have  Sir Smoke-A-Lot  Then we have  Wesley Pipes  And then Oceans  Wesley Pipes is a popular name for bong  Yeah  From half-state  Wesley Pipes  Yes, I'm half-state  Yeah  All right, thank you 
[00:39:30]  Opie, you should smoke some weed  You'd feel a lot better  I'm fine  I'm not ranting and raving  I was just explaining myself  Smoke  Okay  Thank you  Bye  Bye  Let's go to Charles  Charles, what's up?  Hey, what's up, guys?  Hey  Opie, you know what you are?  You know those crooked police officers  Who get the free meals  Because the restaurant owners are nice  Not-not-wink-wink  Right  That's exactly what you're doing with the sports club membership  Now see that  Now that  Now  That's a funny line  I'll give it to you  And whatever  It doesn't  You know  It doesn't hurt me or anything  But you're not getting the point 
[00:40:00]  No, I know  I know what you're saying  But one more funny  See, I'll explain  It's like if a restaurant gave the cops  Like a free gift certificate  And then when the cop went in with the free gift certificate  They wouldn't acknowledge it  That's what it would be like  That's the example  I guess, I guess  I never asked for anything for free  It was given to me  So I would assume  Alright, this is cool  I'll check out the gym  And then I'll be, you know  Well informed when we talk about it on the air  So  Guys, one more thing as a side point  Yeah  You know that Jewish Hitler song that you played before? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah  Did you guys know that yesterday was Holocaust Remembrance Day?  Yeah, that's why we didn't play it yesterday  That would be just way over the top  A bit over the top  Alright, take care guys  You rock  Alright  Let's go to Dave  Dave, what's going on?  Yeah, Opie  Hey  Opie, how you doing?  Dave's not here, man  I listen to you guys all the time  There's one thing I got to say to Opie  Yeah  When somebody gives you free ice cream, Opie  Yeah  Don't complain about the flavor  Just eat this goddamn thing  Dave, you know 
[00:41:00]  Yeah  You're missing the point too  No, I understand  You're not in his ice cream  Yeah, because if I  Hold on  Hold on  Let me explain  How stupid your analogy is  If I'm getting free ice cream  To complain about it  I would have to  You know, I would  I need to taste it  Wouldn't I?  Well, yeah  Well, I'm not  Ice cream's ice cream  I'm not tasting the ice cream  Do you get it?  Hey  Hey  Well, okay, fine  Whatever  I hope  Following your analogy  That would mean  That I got the membership 
[00:41:30]  I have the membership card  I went to the gym  And I didn't like the place  And now I'm on the air  Complaining about it  Right  He didn't get the point  Still a funny line though  Kim, what's going on?  Not much, guys  I myself am Jewish  And I'm listening to  All these other people  Call up and complain  You know what?  They're schmucks  Obviously they have not  Been listening to your show  Long enough  All right  Yeah, she said she stumbles on it  We were just acknowledging  That Hitler was born today  Oh yeah, I was actually  Talking about it  With a co-worker  Money Juice  And we're like  You know what?  So what?  Yeah, let's make believe  He never lived, you know? 
[00:42:00]  Oh, that's unrealistic  But the fact is  You know what?  You can make fun of it  You can make the songs  If you don't want to listen  We'll write them out  Of all the history books  And make believe  He never existed  Obviously  I'm not even going  For that beat  They do that stuff  In Russian stuff  In the communist countries  We'll just make believe  In the golden days  All right, Kim  All right, guys  Enjoy the day  Wow  And us Catholics  Didn't fare too well  During that whole time period  Either  I don't think anybody did 
[00:42:30]  I just think in general  It was a pretty lousy time  You know, I don't think  Many people are having fun  No  Uh, Tyrone  Tyrone  Hey, Joe  What's up?  Yeah, what's up, kids?  Hey  What's up, man?  What's going on?  I'm on the Cibarot today  With my little CD cover  And a joint  And it's a little hard to drive  With one knee on the wheel  And one eye out for the 5-0  I think he's the reigning  Stoner Spelling Bee champion 
[00:43:00]  Hey, what's up?  You let me play again?  Uh, yeah, get home  You gotta get home, though  We only have  Oh, that's right  Okay, I'm on my way home  Right now  Call us when you get home, all right?  All right  Yo, can I come in  And pick up some product?

You sound worse than Ed  Trying to win the Rick Springfield tickets, man  I sound worse than Ed  This guy will get pitbull  About this gym membership, bro  I sound worse than Antoinette  Trying to win the Rick Springfield tickets  Yeah  Well, there's a difference there, too  Because I finally gave up  And I went to the gym  You finally gave up  That's why you still bitching about it  I'm a little bummed  That, you know  I was offered something  And it never happened  That's all  All right, bro  Stop doing it, man 
[00:44:00]  I think a lot of people  Could relate to something like that  Yeah, call me crazy  You can't win  Andrew  How you doing, Ope?  All right  Normally, I'd call you a cheap bastard  But I gotta agree with you on this  You guys don't get any respect  The whole staff should have free memberships  For what you guys charge  For a 30-second commercial  Well, we didn't  We didn't ask for them  We got  I don't ask for anything  You can call me cheap  No, no  I agree with you  No, I know  But I need to make a point now 
[00:44:30]  You can call me cheap  Every day we're on the radio  I don't really care  But the one thing is  I do not ask for stuff  Maybe you could get a membership  By Club Anthony  That's not a bad idea  There you go  Got room?

[00:48:00]  I sure have  She's giving one of her kids back  Defective  The kid's defective  She adopted a defective kid  And she's giving it back  Yeah  Because it's crazy  Read it word for word  Because that's what I got out of it  And she's trying to save face  By saying  We're hoping that  You know  We could bring her back  Into the house  That the authorities took  The kid away  But  An anguished Rosie O'Donnell  Has given up one of her  Four adopted children 
[00:48:30]  The talk queen  Has confirmed that  Authorities took  Her emotionally impaired  Foster child  Mia  For treatment  At a mental health center  Last month  It's a tragedy  For me and my whole family  Rosie says  In the new National Enquirer  I think I can save everyone  It's my weakness  And my strength  Your strength is eating  Yeah how many bites  Did the kid have  Out of her leg  But O'Donnell says  That in the nine months  Since Mia came to live with her 
[00:49:00]  The three year old  Showed more and more symptoms  Of past abuse  Like waking up  Screaming at night  And scratching her arms  She's not the demon seed  Says O'Donnell  But there were real dangerous  Concerns  Danger concerns  With my baby  Blakey  Blakey  I'm just praying  The doctors decide  She can come back  To the family  No she's not  She gave the  In my opinion  She gave the kid back  That's what I'm kind of 
[00:49:30]  Squeaking out of this here  She adopted the kid  Probably a cute  Cuddly little kid  And then all of a sudden  She starts noticing things  Like wait  There's something wrong  With this kid  This kid's broken  Kid's broken  I'm sending it back  Hey you gave me  A busted one  The kid's busted  I want a new kid  New real whole kid  Not half kid  And then to save face  With the press and stuff  Because this stuff  Happens all the time  Yeah  Parents adopt kids  And then all of a sudden  Like wait a minute  Wait a minute

[00:54:00]  On adoption  Like we care  But  Yeah I think  She's just doing this  To make up for her own  You know  Emotional problems  Which I don't think  Is a good reason  To be scooping up children  I like  She just wants a family  You think that's it?  Gay people want families too  Hey hey  You're making some kind  Of accusation here  Allegations that  Have not been proven  Or have not  She hasn't come out  And said anything about  I'm not talking about Rosie  I just went off  On a little tangent  And said gay people  Want families too 
[00:54:30]  Oh so you're saying  That if a woman is gay  Right  That it's okay  If she wants to  Adopt children  Right  Alright  But you have another  Twisted story  As far as  Her and her kids go  Right  Yeah  The last  Of the Rosie trifecta  Rosie O'Donnell  Was so eager  For the love  Of her baby boy  Parker  Remember her first  And her favorite  She makes that obvious  So eager for the love  Of her baby boy  Parker  She didn't bathe 
[00:55:00]  Rosie didn't bathe  Hopi  I read books  She says  That you should have  A newborn baby  Who is adopted  Sleep on you  And get used to  Your smell  And that you shouldn't  Shower for a few days  Rosie tells  Barbara Walters  I guess tonight  She goes  I did it all  So here's this  Poor  Newly adopted  Kid  That's child abuse  That's child abuse  So she didn't shower  So the new kid  Could get used to 
[00:55:30]  Rosie's smell  So Rosie didn't shower  This big  Filthy woman  Laying in bed  With this newborn  Just like probably  Shoving its nose  In her pit  Smell me  This is my smell  I'm your mommy now  I think the kid  Was down near  The pink lettuce  If you're not  Going to shower  And you want  Your kid to smell  Wouldn't it be the same  If I just like  Kind of  You know  Cram him up  Cause he's small  And then deliver him 
[00:56:00]  So then I'll be  The real mommy  Imagine that  Some psycho woman  Tries to do that  I adopt a newborn  And then just  Jam him  And then give birth  You know what  You remind me of  A guy we talked about  Talked to years ago  Dr. Mark Brown  Oh yeah  Remember the lady  That  Excuse me  We gotta get him  On the air  Cause he tells  Some great stories  She came in  To the emergency room  This guy has  A whole bunch  Of sick stories  From the ERs  Around the country 
[00:56:30]  She comes into  The emergency room  Complaining of  Lower abdominal pains  Right  So they  Go to an examiner  They see that  She has stitched  Her  Her most intimate  Of areas  Shut  Shut  Like when you  Sew together the turkey  After you put  The stuffing in  It's the same way  Right  Crudely stitched  Together  Right  So they snip it  And after they  Snip it  They do a pelvic  Exam  They find  She has jammed  A small  Chicken  In the most 
[00:57:00]  Intimate of areas  And sewed herself  Shut up  Because she believed  If she did that  She would have  Children  That she would  Actually would  Turn somehow  Into a baby  And she could  Deliver it  We gotta get him  On the air  Because he's got  All these stories  And they're all  True  Now  They're all  True  And all  Documented  Speaking about  A rooster  Hoping  Speaking about  A rooster  She may have  Heard that  If you put  A cock  There  Rooster  That something  Would happen 
[00:57:30]  But  What am I  Reaching  Someone's  Got to find  Out  Did that  Go through  Someone  On the end  Some feedback  To tell us  Tell me  Tell me  Now  You can't  Have children  What you  Gotta do  Love  Is  Get a  Chicken  Put the  Chicken  There  I will  Make sure  It turns  Into a  Baby  Lisa  Hi  I had a  Story  For you  Yes  It went  Through  Thank you  Yes  Go ahead  Lisa  Okay  My cousin 
[00:58:00]  Couldn't  Have any  Children  So  She and her  Husband  Decided to  Adopt  They adopted  What they were  Told was an  Italian baby  Oh Jesus  Yep  And later on  As the baby  Got older  They figured out  That the baby  Wasn't Italian  But light skin  Black  Right  Mamma mia  We have a  Moony  So what do  They  The family  Was a little  Upset  So what do  They kept  The baby  They kept  The baby  They kept  The baby  They loved  The baby  It was  Sicilian  Probably  Same thing  Alright Lisa

[01:26:30]  You  You  You  i heard uh jeff norris was listening to a click radio on his computer in the car he stepped on  the brake and flew right through the uh sunroof hey robert what's up yeah i wanted to uh the  topic was open i wanted to agree with the guy who just called about the radio chick show  you know i'm giving an honest opinion i think the show's been a lot better than you guys all right 
[01:27:00]  i i haven't learned but you guys get very very defensive when people stop bringing up their show  and it's kind of i think it's kind of funny you guys rag on everybody when somebody brings it up  but you guys you get all defensive well what are we supposed to say yeah you're right she's  you're right but you start getting you know yeah you guys know that's all i wanted to say is that  you guys know people that want it right and then he hangs up then they hang up what do i know that's  it what do i know uh that um they're uh better than uh us according to uh arthur and uh not his 
[01:27:30]  butt buddy there not according to the ratings no well whatever no what if i don't listen to the  radio chick show nothing personal i just don't and i don't get along with anyone from the show anymore  because all the crap that went down yeah there was a lot of bad blood left over from uh from what  happened a few months back a lot of incorrect information that got out there and i'm still  holding a grudge you're right yes crap so uh yeah the show's on the best not on the best of terms  and um you know they got their fans and they they want to call up and bash us whatever you know 
[01:28:00]  but you know what we didn't put you through we put two of you through and you come off stupid because  then you hang up and look like asses we said what we had to say about that when it all went down and  then we left it alone we haven't spent uh our show trashing uh that show or any other show there  you go on wnaw lately  no one's having a rating celebration uh charles today uh yo what's up guys what's up i got a  solution to your problem yeah have the radio chick fired again i i never fired her and you know i was 
[01:28:30]  quite insulted that that was suggested oh wait i got one more quick reference to yesterday yeah  you just said something about somebody's uh computer going through the dashboard or going  through the window yeah why did it end up on top of the dashboard you didn't catch it  i just love the uncomfortable silence dave what's going on hey what's up boys hey yeah i just want 
[01:29:00]  to say you guys are being told tools because you're always dishing it out to everybody else but when  so i'm conscious of what's wrong to you yeah that's it so what is how are we not taking it  dave we're taking it by uh taking the phone calls on the air we see what you want to talk about we  could just blow you off how are we not you don't you don't think i saw arthur arthur and the other  guy and what they want to talk about i guess we gave we give you guys a chance yeah if we can't  take it if we can't take it and i see a phone call on our phone screen that says radio chick so much 
[01:29:30]  better than you guys but don't you think i would just tell stinky to blow it off anthony do you  listen to the chick show um no not really sometimes i i pop into any w yeah but i'm usually  reference so you're on the train too no i drive i listen to wins i listen to scott so why don't you  listen to the show and tell op how it is are you not interested in the competition either  we don't have competition why would the show that's on in the morning be competition for us 
[01:30:00]  dave eugenius go ahead you guys are just being told tools not taking the insults he doesn't have an  answer i don't have an answer but i put the swamp you know the swamp is beginning to sink on you guys  man dave you said really you said you know competition and we're telling you that that's not  competition so why would you not tomato why would you not like the radio chick  because we had our differences and i don't feel like it yeah there was a lot of uh misinformation 
[01:30:30]  but on the but on the other hand we're not uh spending our time on the radio trashing her are we  no we're just kind of we're just kind of leaving it alone doing our own thing and letting them be  the island is just floating out there by itself oh it might float right to another station then we'll  see what happens that i'd love to see and i'd love to see i follow you guys right there oh yeah  guys love the show man i gotta go and then we can talk about real competition not cute little 
[01:31:00]  radio chick competition  i love when people then call after we've taken calls like that and say you guys can dish it out  but you can't thank you what are we doing we're taking it and why because we have an opposing  viewpoint uh then we're we're we're not taking it ricky yo what's up on a happy 420 how you guys  doing all right i just got one thing to say what is the number difference between you guys and the  chick clean and simple it's a blow away when it comes to your numbers isn't it it's not even close 
[01:31:30]  i mean that's what i'm saying all these people should be wasting their time  sucking up sucking uncle junior c instead of making asses themselves on the radio thank you  sir thank you ricky oh you're welcome i'll have you you're a made man thank you sir all right later  fellas it's not rubbing a tug tony it's not even close let's stick with the facts it's not even close  not even in the ballpark  david what's going on hey guys what's going on hey uh you know what since you guys have been on and 
[01:32:00]  since i've been listening to the station since you guys have been on and i've been catching all the  shows and i've gone on with the chick and i've listened to fez and ron the problem is is that i  listen from nine to seven but between nine to twelve i got two shows cramming down to me and  i don't have a chance to enjoy them because i'm either out working driving or doing something else 
[01:32:30]  that i can't listen to them fully right otherwise from nine to seven i would have my radio on  constantly all right i think this management is as uh fired and rehired and changed the lineup up  it just ruins everything because i can't enjoy the shows i can enjoy your show because i can listen  to it more right so i mean i can listen to it i get off of work we're 30 the radio's on the radio on  at home when i'm playing on the computer but it's it's just the from nine to twelve it's great from 
[01:33:00]  twelve to three you know it's great but you know what it's only three hours it's not a full four-hour  show for me all right so your listening habits are all screwed up yeah so i mean i i would i would love to  listen to i'm as confused as he is anthony yeah i know but i think he's making a point by showing  how confused he is with the lineup here he's no you're chill all right david thank you it's  all right thanks guys i mean the one thing i do want to say if it wasn't for anthony and i's success 
[01:33:30]  knock on wood no one else here would have a chance to be successful this would this would be a station  playing jazz or standards or yeah or some ridiculous format right and on top of that  we get you know trash and insulted by people that's okay you know she's uh she's got her fans  that um want to try to start something i guess peter what's going on yo what's up fellas as much  of a tool you are the radio chick is the worst show my ears bleed when i listen to it what are 
[01:34:00]  these guys listening to ron and fez they're great as much of a tool as you are is that a compliment  no no i love you guys you guys have quality radio the chick show i don't they should cut it to an  hour and a half it's horrible i i put it to 10 10 wins instead of that all right peter i'm very  disappointed in you ob why stick up for yourself bro i just did you ditch it out and you can't take it  i just or you should stick up for yourself i just did peter radio chick rules dude these guys are 
[01:34:30]  cool anyone would waste their time to defend that peter peter our show we try to get a bunch of  different opinions out there okay so we so we gave them a chance to you know say the radio chick  rules and why that's all chuck nice was handing out ten dollar bills to ask people to call today i saw  him on 57 they suck ron and fed good sports guys and i don't know they're not that good  you guys keep the channel afloat and if people can't realize that f them all right oh bye opie 
[01:35:00]  you know we didn't realize uh uh during these uh calls it is 420 so we're getting a lot of stone  people i think that are calling up and they're i think their their judgment is clouded maybe their  recollection of certain things are clouded so we we maybe i have to be a little more tolerant i'm  sure the station will be business as usual if and i leaves of course of course all the other shows 
[01:35:30]  will be given a very long chance to succeed this place would be blown up so quick the known fact  we leave it's going to be like the titanic people are going to be jumping ship before they get fired  believe me when they went from classic rock to the talk format the only reason they went to talk  format is because uh we were doing well and and if if we weren't we'd have been out of here we'd have 
[01:36:00]  been a footnote in new york radio as new as any w turns to some other music format that's it  another person wants to call me a tool uh jeff yeah go ahead what's going on first of all i think  the radio chick is on a much harder time slot because she's on in the mornings and second of  all i think opie looks like a tool on the xfl show it was very uncomfortable and stuff on stage  the xfl show we haven't been on that oh my god yeah why do you think you haven't been on it oh my 
[01:36:30]  dear sweet jesus christ thanks jeff okay thank god to me there it is hard a time slot well maybe we  should have gone to a mornings opie oh that's right we weren't allowed what do you want  i've had it wow there ain't enough sam adams in this building to put up with this crap today  all right say what you want yeah that's a tool on xfl game day okay there you go by the way i hear 
[01:37:00]  uh nbc uh probably not picking up uh for next season looks like uh upn will be covering the games  next year upn who is owned by viacom opie who uh owns uh this uh radio uh organization  isn't that a little weird i would say so  all right well xfl show you did last week rocked  just trying to really insults thanks for the love today guys appreciate it yeah thank you thank you 
[01:37:30]  i'm just reading some instant feedbacks and i'm just i'm gonna stick with people of stone  perhaps one of the most interesting words in the english language today is the word 
[01:38:00]  out of all of the english words that begin with the letter f  is the only word that is referred to as the f word it's the one magical word just by its sound  can describe pain pleasure hate and love as most words in the english language is derived from german  the word flicken which means to strike in english falls into many grammatical categories 
[01:38:30]  as a transitive verb for instance john surely as an intransitive verb surely  its meaning is not always sexual it can be used as an adjective such as john's doing all the  work as part of an adverb surely talks too much as an adverb enhancing an adjective  surely is f***ing beautiful as a noun i don't give a f*** as part of a word abso f***ing lutely or 
[01:39:00]  in f***ing credible and as almost every word in a sentence f*** the f***ing f***ers  as you must realize there aren't too many words with the versatility of f*** as in these examples  describing situations such as fraud i got f***ed at the used car lot dismay oh f*** it trouble i 
[01:39:30]  guess i'm really f***ed now aggression don't f*** with me buddy difficulty i don't understand this  f***ing question inquiry who the f*** was that dissatisfaction i don't like what the f*** is going on here  incompetence he's a f*** off dismissal why don't you go outside and play hide and go f*** yourself  i'm sure you can think of many more examples with all of these multi-purpose applications how can 
[01:40:00]  anyone be offended when you use the word we say use this unique flexible word more often in your daily  speech it will identify the quality of your character immediately say it loudly and proudly  f*** you  the opie and anthony show  more stupidity on the way

[01:43:00]  shots switched the beer never made it to the end of the show wow that's probably a great show to do  a drinking game he's burning out a cool phrase it was cool like when they started running the  commercials like oh you're the weakest link goodbye now it's like shut up i just don't like that old  mouth the way she it kind of twitches when she says it the weakest link like a lip goes out to get  those thin school arms nasty thin lips nasty uh hey by the way i'm checking out uh some more of the

[02:19:00]  if you don't think it's funny let me prove it that's all the stuff you did on a tv show no english  jackson snowing but who's that crazy boy but now it's it's it's uh all his own bits but it's not  out in public now it's in front of actors yeah he screwed himself because when he did it all on mtv  it was kind of based on you know him doing it for real yeah it was kind of cool for the movie he  shot people now for the movies using props instead of the real thing and you know acting you know i don't 
[02:19:30]  know what did the review say about it one of the most uh horrendous movies ever made ever  to come out of hollywood you know what just for that statement i'll go see it probably really  definitely that i think that kicked mafia up a notch  no if mafia got kicked up a notch i'm in big trouble but i figure when speaking of sex comes  out if you got four million listeners and the station has a hundred thousand when you're not on  the air that's four million one hundred thousand total for any w if we can get a quarter you know 
[02:20:00]  if you're back to uh 250 then you got a successful movie yeah 200 you know two and a half million  people times ten that's a that's a thirty five hundred million dollar what that'd be a sixty  million it'd be a lot totally yeah i know george what's up there my brother what's up yo jay last  night was the funniest crap i've ever seen in my entire life oh you were there man yeah you rock my man  i tried to man you guys are that was a really nice crowd man they looked like he was really 
[02:20:30]  really into it there were too many yuppies though man nah they went with it i couldn't really see  most of the crowd because of the lights i only really get to look at the people like on the way to  the stage the way off and uh a little bit afterwards but uh you had the hot women in front  of your table dude yeah i know and they're all from the regis and uh kelly show oh yeah that too  yeah so i'm doing like the you know putting your face in the rear end stuff and i'm looking right  at somebody i just saw it seven in the morning nice but they were very nice but i'm glad you  i you know i tried to uh get usually like the first night in the club is like you get the kinks out and 
[02:21:00]  you work and i said you know i'm tired of that i want to like if it's so and it was really packed  so yeah i got really up for it now and you guys were there so i was like i'm not you can't mail it  in you gotta be a long time look at this guy this guy called out he had the best time it was great  it really was this guy could be at his work right now going i went to the jay moore show and it stunk  right now he was working stuff out he had a notebook on stage like everybody else a lot of  new material sound like dice it's scaring me like everybody else no antiques all disposable the funniest 
[02:21:30]  friggin bit you get me with it every time is uh talking about the uh nyquil the cup that comes  with the nyquil and give it to your monkey for a hat a top hat a top hat for his monkey if you have  a monkey i don't know if you do or you don't but you're you're almost assuming everyone does  well who doesn't right and then you do the monkey dancing with the top it kills you  you pass out you wake up the room's a mess but you don't care because the monkey got a little 
[02:22:00]  party in so you're a little happy you had a little like a little bachelor swing party you know you  passed out because you were loaded and he freaked out and there's like crap all over the walls he cut  a hole in his own diaper so you let his tail out that kills me man thank you anthony and junior uh  gay jr is yes i like it too gay jr is the funniest thing i think of yesterday i was playing playstation  in my apartment and you were doing every time gay jr came out i would laugh so hard i had to remind 
[02:22:30]  myself not hit my forehead on the coffee table so that's all right now that the mutual admiration  bull no yeah yeah tom what's going on hey what's up hey i love gay jr all right don't worry about  tom i love you too cnn that said freddie gunfinger might possibly be the worst movie ever released by  hollywood company ever cnn saying that movie the worst ever see now i have to see it now i have to  see why it's so bad yeah when something gets trashed that bad what are you gonna do falls yeah we're 
[02:23:00]  talking about the bad science fiction movies or at least in the 60s in this movie i i think tom green  might have made it bad on purpose it seems like he's happy with the movie even though it seems to be  peter crap he directed it right yeah yeah did it wrote it yeah who turns the reins of the production  over to that guy there you go stay in the ship it's all yours norton what's sad is he seems to be proud  of it it looks like such a bad movie well he's banging drew barrymore he's got 10 million dollars  probably and he could always go back to canada yeah what does he care he lost he lost uh uh a potato 
[02:23:30]  and and he's banging drew barrymore life's pretty good let's not forget the safety net he can always just  take a flight north and be home with american money that prick all right can i ask you guys  a question she's pregnant drew barrymore yeah i guess i want to know what you guys know today i  want to know what you guys all three of you what you thought of the movie fight club did you guys like  it i love fight club right i didn't like it no no i didn't like it for macho reasons i just thought  it's directed like other it is really good i thought the book was better i read the book too it's really 
[02:24:00]  really good didn't bother jay didn't bother you that halfway through the movie it's like that's not a real  person brad pittsley no because then i realized the entire basis of the film was this overwhelming  psychosis and then i got in my own head and i started thinking what if none of it ever ever  happened and that's how freaking crazy is and then i got completely into it then it's like give me my  eight bucks back i mean what do you mean none of it ever happened like this my eight bucks back what  you got to realize is that everyone in the entire world has an alter ego everybody like everyone  wants to see themselves what is this no look take it easy man go play in old sky's living room leave us 
[02:24:30]  alone it's 420 day you're freaking everybody out exactly yeah 420 day right at all hey hookers  strippers you know it's a client shop remember that paul afternoon gentlemen how are you yeah  first of all jay just rented uh suicide came this great movie yes what a funny funny totally underrated  you never hear about that movie and walking was classic uh yeah put me by brett by the fire  i want to be close to brett i just wanted to tell you guys uh tom greenflick got a good write-up at the 
[02:25:00]  times and it's time yeah the guy said it's disgusting and it's repulsive but if you watch  it greens somewhat of an artist at what he does which i just thought was i mean they didn't trash  at all they they thought it was a good movie and if you can stomach it you'd enjoy it well all right  we'll find out this weekend hey have a good one guys thanks and poor drew has a cameo in this i guess  uh as uh an executive's receptionist but that's one of those things where i was like oh like you  you're like steve martin and victoria pennant you were going off on um mr uh courtney cox 
[02:25:30]  last night no you know it gave our cat it got sidetracked into that but it was more on the  1-800 collect phenomenon arsenio hall that right right hilarious because i never did it before last  night i was making that up as i was going that was good but the thing is i've never even  made a collectible like in my life and a commercial is like five million dollars all in to do yeah and  then you got to pay some like bozo like half a million right and and then they have other ones 
[02:26:00]  like no down the center no dial this one and then you got james garner like hey who needs a phone  number from from frogs do this one and i'm like i've never done any of these and you're fighting over  me i'm not i am the demographic and i've never right you think when you make a collect call when  you're either in prison or you're 12 or you're 12. yeah mom come pick me up or mom i'm in prison  first she was a hoover yeah but david arcad just you know and arsenio and like you know there's a 
[02:26:30]  lot of those guys i just don't get it because we're in my opinion respect will outlast cash and  that's what i said last night the crowd got a little freaked out they thought i was preaching maybe but  but that's like nova that was like that no that you got to stay in these rooms like these rooms is  what keeps it well real as i guess it's keeping it right keeping it right but arsenio's got like you  said a hundred million million dollars i'm just saying you could lose touch easily and i choose uh 
[02:27:00]  i think i've chosen wisely to hang out with guys like you and you know spread it around do the regis  thing and then go back into the room at night where hey man i don't give a damn what your credits  are i paid a lot of money you better start tap dancing and put a freaking top hat on  on your monkey they better not offer you a lot of money to do one of those and that's a lot less  money than those commercials because if i'm tuning through those commercials i see jay well gone down  the middle oh you've been offered three times a half million dollars for a day's work wow what are 
[02:27:30]  you not bad or two days well because then you then you're common man you're the down the middle guy  who are you i'm the 1-800 collect guy he's not even arsenio hall anymore he's the 1-800 collect guy  yeah but we all know who he is like i'm looking going i know that person you remember when he was  on five magazine i'm getting it past you huh i'm sharp i'm still sharp tony uncle junior do you uh  do you dial down the middle uh yes and i don't find that ava save a lot very attractive 
[02:28:00]  what about david arquette now he's a good boy he's a ball of energy and ball of energy  i like that i could probably uh i could probably have a good time with him in the bed flip him around a few  times i like when he's dressed like the phone that's a cute outfit that's a cute outfit nothing  was better than the wrestling one tony i'd like to push his pound button oh my god star 69  hey ray what's going on how did you not think of that first

[02:48:30]  in a car with a sober driver and he was sober and uh some uh joe carey was his name came across the  divider and hit them head-on and the engine block came through the dashboard and cut my cousin in half  and he was so disfigured that in court they had to put sheets over his head for the photos they  wouldn't let them and that was spookier than seeing him dead or seeing him with the sheets  oh wow so christine todd whitman passed the law if you kill someone in a drunk driving accident no  matter what you have to do uh three years in prison but this guy killed two people because  he killed his own passenger too so but he was a real prick like he i can't say that all right yeah 
[02:49:00]  you can say that he would he was a real uh jackass because he'd go to court in like metallica t-shirts  and like he didn't he's not even smart enough to go yeah that was then but now i'm a born-again  christian so please take that right he's just sitting there with like headphones on listening  to pantera you know probably listening to you guys oh hey thanks thanks a lot jay he doesn't  get up early enough to listen to this guy or mason and karnsky for that i wonder why the numbers went  down oh jesus so uh my family got a knock on the door so he got 14 years in prison because he was a 
[02:49:30]  real a-hole and so he's backing into rolls of black tar paper every day as he should so his  passenger died and the other passenger died and uh they got a knock on their door like they're  eating dinner and somebody says ferguson residence and they're like yeah and the guy goes here you go  joe carey's gonna get out of jail in three years to the day so he's not even gonna serve the six  years that christine todd christine todd whitman put in for each death he's doing three exactly  this kid's safer in jail you know because it's franklin new jersey it's a bunch of hillbillies
