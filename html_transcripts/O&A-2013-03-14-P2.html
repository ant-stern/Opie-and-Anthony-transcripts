<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony show began with Sam Roberts hosting the "After Opie and Anthony Live" segment.  He started by promoting Opie's Sudoku puzzles as a listener giveaway, transitioning into a discussion about their ongoing obsession with professional wrestler Fandango and their frequent playing of Billy Gunn's theme song.  The Wrestlemania card and predictions were briefly covered.  This led into the "What Did You Learn?" segment, where listeners called in with a variety of responses, ranging from the mundane to the absurd, all vying for a Sudoku puzzle.  Sam and Eric then criticized Sal's performance as a phone screener during the main show, highlighting his unenthusiastic and lackluster manner, offering suggestions for improvement.  Various listener calls followed, covering topics from old cartoons to the late Dimebag Darrell.

Comedians Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero then joined the show.  Their conversation covered their upcoming performances at Caroline's Comedy Club, the new Pope, Catholicism, and Scientology.  A substantial portion of the discussion focused on their experiences with Scientology personality tests and their opinions on the religion, marked by frequent and offensive language.  The conversation also included discussions about race and religion, again employing offensive language and stereotypes. DJ Whoo Kid briefly joined this segment.  The show concluded with an improvised advertisement for Dollar Shave Club.  Notable funny moments included the listener calls for the "What Did You Learn?" segment, the critique of Sal's phone screening, the discussion of the new Pope and Catholicism, and the detailed and often offensive discussion about Scientology.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Greg audio  Antonio  The Opie and Anthony show continues  This is After ONA Live  Here's your host, Sam Roberts  Yes indeed it is  After Opie and Anthony Live  On Thursday  Thirsty Thursday  We got a couple Opie Sudoku puzzles  866-WOW-1-WOW 
[00:00:30]  I haven't given them out in a while  Because we've been busy  But I've got today's and yesterday's  Eric, do you have an Opie Sudoku puzzle  For a prize in your  Collection of memorabilia?  That I do not  You would have wanted one at a time  There was a time when you would have wanted one  There was a time when I would have wanted one  You know?  Frame that shit  Back in the long, long ago  But Opie has pulled it off  He's figured out how to not only do a radio show  But complete a full Sudoku puzzle 
[00:01:00]  So  If you want Opie Sudoku puzzles  They're here for the taking  I was delighted when I woke up this morning  Because I didn't see it last night  To see that Fandango and Opie were Twitter buddies now  Yeah  I don't know how exactly  I'm assuming that it's because a lot of our fans tweeted him  The wrestler, Fandango  Who doesn't wrestle unless you pronounce his name right  And claims that nobody has yet  So he won't wrestle  I'm assuming a lot of our fans tweeted him 
[00:01:30]  Saying, you know  Opie's been talking about you  Blah, blah, blah  But I know that I have specifically  Gone and spoken to a bunch of people  Who work at WWE  Trying to spread the word  That Fandango is the show's new obsession  Yeah  Because it's been a while  Since there was a big  Since anything to do with  Professional wrestling was involved in the show  So the fact that it's not only  Involved in the show so heavily  But it's new  Is something  But I talked to someone yesterday 
[00:02:00]  And he said  That he and Billy Gunn  A.K.A. Mr. Ass  Were having a conversation  About how Fandango  Keeps getting mentioned on the Opie and Anthony show  And I go  Well did you tell him we play his theme song all the time?  And he goes  No, I didn't  I didn't know you  What?  Nobody knows we've been playing Mr. Ass  For how many years?  I go  It's a regular thing  We play Mr. Ass's theme song literally  I kept cutting Opie off the other day 
[00:02:30]  With his Pop-Tarts story  Because I didn't want to turn Mr. Ass off  Where else have people heard all three verses?  Three verses to that song  So hopefully  Hopefully  Word is going to start getting back to Mr. Ass  Because I had no idea  The people didn't know that we were doing that  That it wasn't kind of common knowledge by this point  But I have told people who talk to Mr. Ass  I myself don't talk to him  Does Vince know that Anthony does him?  I would hope so  Anthony does one of the best Vince McMahon's there is 
[00:03:00]  Let me talk to Derek in Kentucky  What's up Derek?  How are you talking about today?  I can't understand what you're saying  Is your phone stuck?  Yeah, I'm talking about  Yeah, your phone sucks  Sorry buddy  John in Chicago  What's up gentlemen?  How are you today?  Good  That's cool  Hey listen, quick question for you  What do you think about the upcoming Wrestlemania card?  And what are your predictions?  I think they need to  Get it fired up a little more  I'm not that excited, you know? 
[00:03:30]  Totally  I totally agree  And the Undertaker  Does he lose to Punk?  That's the question  Well the real question  Because now  For those that don't know  CM Punk  He's a friend of the show  They're giving him the Undertaker match this year  The Undertaker always wins at Wrestlemania  The question is  Is the Undertaker finished?  Because if he's done wrestling  Then, you know, he'll lose  Hopefully  Because, you know, it makes sense  But if he's not  Then I don't know  Maybe Stone Cold  Once in a year  Right, maybe Stone Cold comes in  And starts whipping ass 
[00:04:00]  And sets up for next year  I don't know  I don't know for sure  You want to  It would be  It would be great  You want a Sudoku puzzle?  I would love a Sudoku puzzle  Thank you  Alright, John  Hold on  You just won yourself  A Sudoku puzzle  Hang on the line for John  Let's do  What did you learn?  Ryan in Saskatchewan  Do you have a  What did you learn?  I will in about three days  Because I'm an Audible subscriber  I can't do it  I can't give it to you then, dude  Can't give it to you then  Is this my buddy from Kentucky? 
[00:04:30]  It is, Sam  Sorry about that  That's okay  What did you learn?  I learned today  That the tickets today  For the Jim Norton show  In Perrysburg, Ohio  Are still available  That works as a  What did you learn?  Very good  You want a Sudoku?  I would love one  Alright  There it goes  The second Obie Sudoku puzzle  And by the way  Is it just two that you have?  Yeah, it's just the two  But people should still call in  For what did you learn?  Yeah, put those  Put them on hold  The videos that Obie was talking about 
[00:05:00]  Are up on his YouTube channel  At Obie Radio  They're on our Facebook too  Oh, okay  Facebook.com  Slash Obie and Anthony  Those are the freakiest things I've seen  And I think I might be  Just as freaked out  About the latter one  There's something about  Like looking up  Or looking down  Whichever direction you're in  And just seeing nothingness  But ladders  And no people  And the potential  To fall  A long way  It just  It freaks me out  So you can't do a ladder match  I can't do a ladder match 
[00:05:30]  For various reasons, Eric  One is  I don't like climbing ladders  Even if it's for the title?  Well, it depends on which title  920  You're on the show  Sam, who in the hell  Is screaming phone calls  This morning?  I don't know  Who is it, Eric?  That would be Sal  For the main show  You're talking about?  The main show, yes  Yeah  Okay, why?  What was going on with Sal today?  I thought the guy  He just  He is such a lackluster  Addition to anything  Even phone screening  Yeah, but he just 
[00:06:00]  Picks up  All night  You can hardly hear  What he's saying  He doesn't ask your name  Where you're from  And it's like  You're just supposed to  Belt something off  To get him to  Fucking  You know  Think you're worthy of it  Are you in there  With Sal, Eric?  During the show, yes  Is he  Is this true?  Does Sal just pick up  And go O and A  I don't hear much  Of how Sal  Handles the phones  Where is he?  I think he's in the back  Doing something  Well, he's got to  Pick up his energy  Thank you, sir  He's got to pick up  His energy  Come in here, Sal  If you're listening 
[00:06:30]  Because I've got to know  He's got to pick up  His energy  Because if he doesn't  Have energy  As the call screener  How do you  How do you expect  The listeners  To have any energy, right?  Pete  Hey, today I learned  That Detroit, Buffalo  And Atlanta  Used to be prominent cities  But not so much anymore  Yeah, they were cities  That rose to prominence  And now Sal is just  Lingering down the hall  He's just slowly walking  Like we have nothing  Better to do  Why are you  Giving the callers  No energy  When they call in? 
[00:07:00]  I'm giving them  No energy?  You called in  And said that you  Pick up the phone  I heard the guy  And you just go  O&A  O&A, yeah  Because then  Half the time  If I say O&A name  They just start telling  The story immediately  But I would say  So I let them do  Either or  And then I assess it  Because it gets  The call done quicker  No, you got to go  O&A, who's this?  What do you got?  Because when you say  O&A, who's this?  They say  Yeah, uh  So it's just easier  To let them make  The decision of  What they want  To tell me  What their name is  No, no, no, Sal  You make the decisions  You're in charge here 
[00:07:30]  You're the boss  There's absolutely no way  Of fighting with the callers  There's no winning  Whatsoever  You know, that's the problem  You know, like  You're trying to fight with them  I'm not trying to fight with them  You just said  You shouldn't be fighting with them  I'm not fighting with them  I'm saying there's no way  To fight to go against  What they're going to do  They're going to do  What they're going to do  Regardless  Well, with weak leadership  They will  Snowy in Michigan  Hey, Sammy  How you doing today, sir?  I'm great, Snowy  Yep  Very hornet  To the radio business  Okay, buddy 
[00:08:00]  I heard that  Calvin Quinn  Is a big fan  Of Neil Sadaka's song  Bad Blood  That was yesterday  But you still learned it  It counts, right?  I don't  I didn't know it was yesterday  That was yesterday, wasn't it, Eric?  Yeah, it was yesterday  I've been on show for a couple days, Sammy  I didn't have a chance  To listen to the show  For a couple days  These days blend together  Don't they, Snowy?  Well, especially  I'm not in my truck  It's getting fixed  It's freaking broke down  Down here  You're dangerous  Behind that wheel  Fontaine  Hey, buddy  What's up?  What's up, buddy?  Hey, do you know  Who the best phone screener 
[00:08:30]  Was back in the day?  It was Travis  Travis  He was a good phone screener  Hell yeah  When I called in  He would automatically  Pop up my  MySpace page  He would know  He would know  Yeah, yeah, yeah  Hey, I got a  What do you learn?  Yeah  Usually you can pull  Just about anything  Out of the show  And make up a  What do you learn?  But today  I really did learn  That Stephen Lynch  Is the result  Of a priest  Fucking a nun  Holy shit  I didn't know  About that either  I didn't know  About that either  That's very strange  Did you know that, Eric? 
[00:09:00]  I had no idea  I guess  Obie said  They talked about it  On the show  It must have been  A very long time ago  I'm wondering  If that is true  Because Stephen  Likes to tell  A lot of stories  Oh, like he just  Makes shit up  Because it's funny sometimes  Yeah, and I think  Maybe he said it  Early on in their  Relationship  So they just  Believed it  Oh  Back  Like before he understood  That the show  Is about like  Telling  Just what's going on  Yeah, usually  If your parents  Are a priest  That had a baby  With a nun  It would usually  Be like a horror movie  Like they're the devil  Child  Right, right, right, right  Oh boy 
[00:09:30]  Rick  Yeah, Sal's a fucking  Joke on the phones, man  That other caller  Was right  All he does is  O&A  And that's it  That's all you fucking hear  Wow  Wow  Let me go to Jay  What's up, Jay?  Yeah, I had something  Funny to say  And he hung up on me  What?  What was it?  Tell me what it was  You guys were talking  About who was the  Leader of the Catholic Church  Who was the leader  Of the Muslims  I said, you know  The leader of the  Water Buffaloes  Was a Grand Poobah  Yeah, throw it up 
[00:10:00]  Why not, right?  Flintstones reference  Right, and we're talking  About the Flintstones  And he hung up  In the middle of it  And I just felt like  You know, he does it  He does it a couple  Of times already  Jay, I don't want you  To feel bad  Because of that, okay?  I don't want you  To think that because  Maybe Sal is not  The greatest phone screener  We've ever had  That it makes you  Any less of a human being  I appreciate that  Very much, Sam  You're the man, bro  You are the man, Jay  No matter what Sal says  I got a quick question for you  Yeah, yeah  Whenever I listen to the radio 
[00:10:30]  You know you get a mental picture  Of sometimes  If you don't see the people  Right  Doesn't Club Soda Kenny  Sort of seem like  You know that guy  From Ghost  The weird, weird guy  On the train  Patrick Swayze?  Yeah, I've always  I've always gotten that  Sort of  Like when I hear  I know what Club Soda Kenny  Looks like  But like when I hear him  On the radio  I'm just thinking of like  Patrick Swayze  And the hair is blowing  And yeah, I totally get you, Jay  All right, I'll talk to you  Later, buddy  Definitely get a Patrick Swayze vibe  Have you gotten that too, Eric? 
[00:11:00]  Kenny is a hell of a dancer  He is  He's a good dancer  He's a good looking guy  He's in great shape  You must have been in heaven today  With all the cartoon talk  Cartoon talk  Fandango talk  Now  It was great  Do you like the cartoon talk  When it's old school cartoons  Or are you just like  I like certain old school cartoons  There's a lot of old school cartoons  That were just complete garbage  Like what's garbage?  Tennessee Tuxedo  What is that?  It was  Remember  What was his name?  The guy from Get Smart  Don 
[00:11:30]  I don't know  I'm forgetting his name  But sure, I know the show  He voiced the cartoon  He was a penguin  Who had a sidekick  That was a walrus  And they would  Like solve mysteries  And things like that  So it was like  Get Smart  Except with sea animals  Yeah  It was an old school  60s into the 70s  Cartoon  It might be like  A Hanna-Barbera  Or something like that  But things along those lines  Just weren't funny  That was garbage  Yeah  But if  Like Anthony says  Looney Tunes  Were really good  Rocky and Bullwinkle  Which is an older series  You love Rocky and Bullwinkle 
[00:12:00]  It's very funny  You watch it now  I would watch it  If it was on, yeah  But it's not in your DVD collection?  No, I don't own it yet  Yes  You should  Working on it  I remember I got you  A Looney Tunes DVD  For Christmas one year  You actually sit there  And watch  It was in addition to  Yeah, because it was  The golden series  I don't know  I found it on your Amazon list  There was no thought put into it  I know  But it was appreciated  I was like  Oh, I did the work for myself  Exactly  Exactly  What's going on, Roland? 
[00:12:30]  Rex Brown was late  Huh?  Rex Brown was late  Who's Rex Brown?  I don't know  Some singer from  The group called  Pantera  Oh, oh, oh  The bassist for Pantera  Yeah  I mean, the singer for Pantera  Probably didn't  You know  I don't know these groups  Yeah  You don't know Pantera?  No  They're kind of big  But I know  Dimebag Daryl  Big story  He's dead  He's dead  Yeah, he's very dead  He was shot on stage  There's people around here  Who still mourn it 
[00:13:00]  Yeah  I don't even  That's why I didn't  Want to mention it  I don't want Jose  To start crying somewhere  Fuck him  Fuck Dimebag Daryl  What's wrong with you?  Why are you so upset?  Don't say that  Don't say fuck Dimebag Daryl  There's a big cardboard cutout  Of a dumb hole  And then Jimmy had to fly  And let's just say  Let's just say what?  It's very stressful  Oh  It's like  Where the fuck are you?  That's still  You don't need to disgrace  Do you know who comes on time  Every time? 
[00:13:30]  Who?  Mr. Blake Shelton  He's never been here  I've never seen him here  He's been here  But not on our shows  Alright then  He's never been here  On the channel  Soon  You're working on that  Oh, very soon  What time is he going to get here?  I'll buy you lunch soon  We'll talk later  That's Roland's Honeybee  Kevin in Mineola  Why are you insulting me? 
[00:14:00]  Because I don't know  Who Stephen Lynch's parents are  Thanks, Jerky Boy  Yeah, he is  He's a little Frank Rizzo, isn't he?  I used to have a Jerky Boy's tape  I remember when I bought  The Jerky Boy  You had to have  The Jerky Boy's tape  Because it was hilarious when it came out  But I was a kid when it came out  And so I remember going to Sam Goody  And buying the Jerky Boy's on cassette  Sam Goody  Yeah, yeah, yeah  And buying the Jerky Boy's on cassette  And my mother took it away from me  And hid it in her drawer for years  She wanted to listen to it?  No, she didn't want to listen to it  Yeah, yeah, yeah 
[00:14:30]  You can bring him on in  She loved the Egyptian magician?  Yeah  Come on in  Of course I have guests  This is a big show  Hi, how are you?  Welcome, Natasha  Hi  How are you?  Sit down  How are you, sir?  Good, nice to see you  How's it going?  Tell me how to pronounce your name  Moshe  Moshe  Moshe  Moshe  Moshe Kasher  Moshe Kasher  Moshe Kasher  Natasha Leggero  Caroline's this weekend  Yeah  It's an exciting time  You picked a good time to come to New York, too  Because you avoided the soda ban, you know? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, so what about that St. Patrick's Day harangue  That's going to be happening?  Oh, it is this weekend, isn't it?  Scared  Yeah, you're going to be here while the parade's going on  Do you celebrate St. Patrick's Day, either of you?  No, I'm a Jew, so I specifically don't celebrate St. Patrick's Day  You're anti  Yeah  Any Catholic leader who has green beer, I'm not in  Right, you don't want it  What about you, Natasha?  I was raised Catholic, I guess you consider me a lapsed Catholic  You have lapsed?  Yes  So are you excited about the Pope or not so much? 
[00:15:30]  I could give a shit  Yeah, it's not  About the Pope  Right  I'm in, man  But you're excited about the Pope  I will not celebrate St. Patrick's Day, but I do worship our new papal leader  Yeah, yeah  I'm very happy about him  It's very strange that they put, like, this guy quits  And you're not supposed to quit the Popedom, you know?  And then they put in, how old, the new guy's 76 years old  I didn't know that  Yeah, he's 76 and he's got one lung  No, he doesn't  Yes, he does 
[00:16:00]  He's got one lung  Does he have an iron lung that he hangs out in his day?  Yeah, yeah, the Vatican is an iron lung  Like those old East Side Socialites  They just pushed him out and, hello  I want an iron lung  He's only got one lung in his body  That's crazy, like, naturally, or he had one taken out?  I think they said when he was a teenager, he had his lung taken out  Damn, that's a real gangster Pope  I guess so, but he's all  Yeah, I got shot in the lung, dog  How do you just have one lung?  I don't know  I thought it was necessary  I didn't know they were, like, kidneys  That you could, yeah, I have two lungs  You can have one 
[00:16:30]  Did you hear about the fact that they found out that the largest gay bathhouse in Rome  Is in a building that is owned by the Vatican?  Really?  Yes, that's for real  And there was a cardinal or a bishop or whatever the high level is living in the building  You know what I'm saying?  I mean, it's like, oh, I wonder why, you know  But it's good, actually, because you're allowed to take confession orally, apparently  Oh, is that right?  Yeah, good news  Is that right?  Yeah, I was saying the only thing that's gayer than a gay bathhouse  Is announcing your new leader in plumes of white smoke 
[00:17:00]  I don't think you're, I mean, but then the Pope comes out  This Pope is also, I think, very anti-homosexuality and gay marriage  Oh, this Pope isn't one of the pro-gay folks?  No, no  They went to the cardinals and they did not find that this Pope was pro-gay  But I was just, they didn't take the black guy  That would have been cool  A black Pope?  A black Pope would have been so good  There's sort of nothing  A black Pope would be dope  Right  A black Pope dope  He would have named himself Pope Dope, for sure 
[00:17:30]  There was nothing noteworthy about it, though  It was just like, oh, it's an old white guy  I guess because he's from South America  That's something, right?  No  No  I mean, I didn't know where the others were from  I just knew that they didn't speak English well  There was an American, wasn't the New York guy, supposedly, in the mix?  He was in the mix, but they were like  They said that they would never give it to an American  Because we already have too much power  Oh, right  So they can't give us Catholicism, too  So how many years does this, like, one long Pope have left?  I wouldn't think very many  Like four?  Like, he's still, when he gets out there 
[00:18:00]  He seems like a Pope that's on his last legs  And it's his first day  How, does a Pope have to be old?  Like, what if they just got, like, a strapping, like, handsome man?  They should  They don't have to be anything  Apparently you could  You don't even need to elect somebody from within the Catholic Church  I mean, they have to be Catholic  But you don't have to elect a Cardinal  You don't?  No, apparently not  Apparently you just have  They have to be Catholic  Like, they used to  Back in the day  They used to elect, like  They would elect, like, a powerful kind of leader  You know, maybe a royal type of person  To kind of consolidate power 
[00:18:30]  But now, now it's all, you know  But what about, like, Natasha's a lapsed Catholic?  Could she be Pope?  Could she be  I don't think any woman can be Pope  Pope Natasha?  So women can't be Popes?  I doubt it  I mean, they can't be priests  They probably can't be Popes  The Catholic religion is very misogynistic  Really?  And very, uh  Is this new?  Yeah, yeah  Hold up  I thought Catholicism has been very accepting  And sort of  It is, I mean  It's, it's like  I think it might be the worst religion 
[00:19:00]  Come on  Worse than Scientology  I feel bad for Scientologists  Because, like, people  That look at Scientologists  Like, these people are out of their minds  Like, listen to these stories  This can't be real  It's like aliens and stuff  But you go  You don't believe in Thetans?  It's just because it's new  Do that  Like, it's no more ridiculous than  Jesus lives in the sky  Well, no  That's true  That's true  And Mormon is pretty new, too  Yeah  I went to the headquarters in LA  Of the Scientology headquarters  And, uh 
[00:19:30]  It's crazy  They  Apparently they don't give a fuck  About the way people think about them  Because the interior design theme  Was literally  If you went to a designer  And were like  I'd like you to make  Something reminiscent of a cult headquarters  If you could maybe  Design it specifically to look scary  Like they're all wearing turtlenecks  Every one of them has a turtleneck on  Matching white sneakers  It's not a joke  They  It's very bizarre  I was there, too  I took a personality test  Oh, and yeah  I took it, too  You did?  I think everybody does that  When they move to LA  Oh 
[00:20:00]  They go  They go  Personality test  It's like  It's like  There he is  That's the new Pope  The Pope's on TV right now  Right  You look good, though  He looks sexy, though  He looks very lucid  Yeah, I mean  He looks good  Being 70  And having one lung  Yeah, he doesn't look one lung  That's for sure  No, you never  Once he takes his shirt off  It's a mess  But, you know  So, folks can't have sex  Is that right?  No way  I wouldn't think so  They're like priests  Yeah  Right, priests never have sex  No, well  Not with women  Right  So you got personality tests  Oh, yeah  Both of you done? 
[00:20:30]  It's funny  All of it  Everything is the same  They go  They show you a line  They go  Here's normal  And here's where you are  Oh, whoops  It looks like you're totally below normal  On every single part of your personality  But good news  There's something that can help  Can anybody guess what that is?  No  It's Scientology  Oh, fantastic  I'm here already  It does cost some money  But it is pretty creepy  Because you realize  To fall for it  You have to be so desperate  Really?  Well, because it doesn't make sense 
[00:21:00]  Like when I did my personality test  The man was like  Because I gave him a fake name  And he's like  Amber  And Amber is the fake name too  It's like the number one used fake name  Is it?  Nobody's named Amber  But if you had said  Your name is Amber  And he had looked at you  Cocked his eyebrow  Adjusted his turtleneck  And said  Your name is not Amber  Would you have converted?  I would have been a little more impressed  Yeah  But he was like  Amber  Do you read a lot of books?  And I was like  Why?  He's like  You got a very high score 
[00:21:30]  But I got a high score  Because it's so obvious  What the answers are  And what they're trying to manipulate you into doing  One of them readers  What do you  It was pretty rough  I just felt so bad for the people  Well I'd just like to say  If there are any fans listening  That are Catholic or Scientologists  I think both religions are great  You love all religions  I would love  Whatever religion my fans are  I think is the best one  I mean let's be honest  Judaism is just as wacky as the rest of them  Everything's wacky  Right, right  The whole thing is crazy  But Judaism is like  I think it's a little more 
[00:22:00]  It does feel  Racially pure  Well  Which is nice  But it does seem superior  In the sense that  Like the leaders  The rabbis  They can have sex  Like why try to repress people  Into not having sex  And suppressing this natural instinct  And then all of a sudden  They start  How many rabbis  Do you know who fuck little boys  Honestly I can't see any  Negative blowback  From a chastity fan  I can't see how that could go wrong  You can't  I mean I guess they did  Right  They did do the sex with boys 
[00:22:30]  But you hear about weird rabbis  Like there's that one rabbi  True  Who is like  Nowhere near as many as like  The priest  No  I mean every week  It's an epidemic  It is bad  Yeah yeah yeah yeah  I mean the rabbis  It's like once every like  Five years  Some rabbi is like  Sucking off babies  Well that's  Circumcising  Yeah that's the jubilee year  In the bible  Yeah  Once every five years  You gotta suck off a baby  Jubilee  Yeah  Hopefully the baby's name  Is jubilee  So are you like  Are you very religious  Do you practice your Judaism  Or are you lapsing  I mean  I have a lot of money 
[00:23:00]  If that's what you mean  Yeah  I do count coins  And swim in them  Like Scrooge McDuck  If that is what you mean  Do you have a lot of industry friends  Oh definitely  Yeah sure sure sure  I run a couple magazines  Okay  Jet Magazine  Ebony  I got all the black ones  For some reason  But they give them out  You know there's a meeting  Oh  There's an annual kind of  Media meeting  Right right right  And you get a magazine  Or whatever  And I got pretty lucky this year  I got Ebony  And Michelle Obama was on the cover  So that's good  It's great  It's great  You can't do better  I'm not anti-religion  I actually have a degree in religion  So I kind of like them all 
[00:23:30]  Theology  Well no  Like religious studies  Like comparative religion  But I do some Jew stuff  You know I don't eat bacon  And that's probably  No that's because I'm a Jew  It is  I don't eat pork  I don't eat shrimp  I miss shrimp  Have you tried bacon  I have yeah it's good  I get it  It's delicious  I had literally  I had it this morning  No it's very good  Yeah you should rethink that  I should get back into it  But it is a swine  I guess  But it's delicious  I mean I don't know  What that even means  It means it's a swine  Think about it  Is that bad  Like isn't  Well think about what it does 
[00:24:00]  It just rolls around and shit  But it's not like cows  Are hygienic animals  I mean chickens also roll around and shit  That is true  Like have you ever  Meat is pretty nasty  I guess  But it's delicious  It is good  Like what's better than bacon and chicken wings  I guess  Vegetables  No  Not burning in hell  I guess so  Yeah  Depending  Depending on where you go  You know there's bacon in heaven  So you forego it on this earth  Oh is that what they tell you  So when you get to heaven  You get bacon  There's a lot of buffets  Basically you know the hometown buffet  Yeah 
[00:24:30]  That's Jewish heaven  Oh really  Like a cracker barrel  Because it's free  You just keep going back  You keep going back  So when you went out for Scientology  I'm trying  Did you just go like as an adventure  Like I gotta just go  They give personality tests to whoever  I was on a date  I thought I was on a date too  Really  I really was yeah  And you're like this is what we should do  Well cause they play that movie  Psychology kills  Like well there's that  There's an exhibit there  An art exhibit  For all of you cultured people  Called psychology kills the exhibit  And so they have that 
[00:25:00]  And then they also have a movie  That they play like every 45 minutes  Oh so you just get to like  Get like one of those Disney movies  Where it's like nobody's really there  But you just walk in  And it's always playing  Yeah and they talk about  The cruise  They have a cruise  That like if you're on a high level  Tom Cruise  Well Tom Cruise does go on that cruise  But it is some kind of cruise  That you get to go on  If you're on that high level  Oh right  Yeah  So like everybody else is fighting  To get into heaven  And Scientologists are like  I gotta get tickets to that cruise  No it's a funny name  I'm gonna try to find it  A cruise is a more realistic heaven 
[00:25:30]  Than heaven heaven  Yeah  I mean  At least cruises do exist  I would have an easier time  Believing I'm going to get on a cruise  If I behave myself  Than I'm going to get into heaven  No it's like the end result  Cause there's different tiers  Of Scientology  And then to get into this  I'm trying to think of  What the name of it is  It has a funny name  But yeah  So people try to get in that cruise  But they tell  They try to tempt you with it  At this movie  I bet they know  What they're doing like  I bet they know  That people like you go  Knowing that you're just  Going to make a mockery of it  But they're aware 
[00:26:00]  That there's a percentage  Of people that go in there  And make a mockery of it  And go  You know  This kind of makes some sense  Actually  I'm sure you're right  I gotta check this out  A little bit  But that's what I was saying  I was impressed  With how unabashed  They were  About their  Their design theme  Like it wasn't  It was  If I was Scientology  I would think  You know people are all  Making fun of us  They all think we're called  Let's make the inside  Of this like  A funky bohemian coffee shop  You know  Maybe trick them  Into belief  No they did not  There was a office  Of L. Ron Hubbard's office 
[00:26:30]  Untouched  That was like roped off  And his like  Shoes were on the desk  And they're like  Waiting for him to return  I mean they didn't care  Right  So it says  The Scientology  The highest level  Which is  O-T-V-1-1-1  That sounds like  A strain of HIV  So it's only  Disclosed  The highest level  Of Scientology  Is only disclosed  At sea  On the Scientology  Cruise ship  Called Free Winds  Free Winds  Yeah so you've got  To get  On this ship 
[00:27:00]  And that's  That's what the movie  Tells you about  Like if you can  Stay with it  For long enough  They will disclose  To you all their secrets  And you know what it is  It's four o'clock  Shuffleboard  That's the secret  There it is  Yeah that's all you need  And everybody's included  We have plenty of  Shuffleboard for everybody  But it all seems like  But then you realize  That like Will Smith  And Tom Cruise  And John Travolta  Like they're full-fledged  Will Smith bothered me  The most  How about Beck  I think because he's black  Beck is a Scientologist  You know who I read  Who's a Scientologist 
[00:27:30]  Today that just bothered me  Giovanni Ribisi  Oh really  His mother is a  Casting director  And they run a  Scientology like  Acting situation  For the actors  I feel like  Boiler Room  Was so good  That he should be  Able to be like  This is too strange  To exist  Am I the only one  That feels though  That black people  Shouldn't be  Black people  Should know better  Like they should just be  I feel like  The savviness  Should be hot  Like I just feel like  I'm black  Right like  I'm black  Like my ancestors 
[00:28:00]  Been through all this  Bullshit  You're not gonna  Trick us again  We've been through  The ringer  I'm the fresh  Prince of Bel-Air  I was raised  In West Philadelphia  Right  Born also  Also born there  Yeah yeah yeah  Where I spent  Most of my days anyway  Yeah well you'd think  And you'd think like  He knows  But that's why  Like Will Smith  Tom Cruise  These are guys that could  Control the world  If they wanted to  Because they make  Millions of dollars  Every time they put out  A movie  But they just attach  Themselves to Scientology  Well have you ever  Seen this video  There's a video online  Of um 
[00:28:30]  What's her name  Will Smith's wife  Jada Pinkett  Jada Pinkett Smith  And the little girl  Willow or whatever  And they're talking  It's like  This is what rich  What happens  When people get too rich  They start to  Disassociate with reality  Because they're like  It's her  Jada Pinkett  Her mom  So the grandma  And Willow's talking  And they're just like  Worshipping every word  She says  They're like  So what do you think  Life is  Well I think  Willow's saying this  Willow's like  Life is  Life is  Is good  But it's also hard  And like 
[00:29:00]  Ooh  Listen to her  The wisdom from her  It's like  There's no fucking wisdom  Yeah she's so confident  Yeah  I heard an interview  With her  And she's like  I get my flow  From my dad  And I'm like  No one ever told me  I had a flow  I get my flow  From my dad  But unfortunately  He was a deaf Jew  So there's not a lot  Of flow there  It wasn't great  This is the same  Willow Smith  That whipped her hair  Back and forth  And did all that  Right  That's the same  Yeah who had a hit  At 12  Right  And she's the one  Who's kind of  Giving her perspective  On  On life  And theology  And Jada Pinkett 
[00:29:30]  Woo child  Oh the wisdom  From this child's lips  To God's ears  Let's go to  Kevin in Houston  You're on with  Moshe Kasher  Kasher  Kasher  You have a very hard  To pronounce name  Well you know  I have some fans  They know how to pronounce it  Moshe Kasher  And Natasha Leggero  They're going to meet  Caroline's all weekend  By the way  What's up Kevin  Hey guys  How y'all doing  Hey I downloaded that book  I can't remember  The girl's name  She was on the show  A couple months back  Oh you remember  Yeah the  Hubbard  Or whoever it was  That left 
[00:30:00]  The girl who left  Scientology  Like her uncle  Was one of the  Higher up  Muckety muck people  Yeah  I highly suggest  Anybody if you  Want to learn  How fucking goofy  That religion is  To download that book  I mean  It made me  Physically mad  Reading  Like some of the shit  They believe in  Which is fine  If they want to believe that  That's their deal  But it goes back  To the point  With stupid Bloomberg  And his soda fan  Really  All it is  Is about power  These people have 
[00:30:30]  So much god damn money  It's just power  They just want  To control people  Ooh cha  The wisdom  From y'all  Man  It's probably right  But I get the same  Weird out feeling  When like  Stephen Baldwin  Starts talking about  Jesus and stuff like that  For sure  When he goes on  It's the same  I mean whenever  There's something powerful  Everybody wants to  Control it  Yeah  And I mean  Scientology  I don't know how  I mean I think  It just has money  Attached to it  I just think  Any extremism  Of any form  At all  No matter  Religion  Politics 
[00:31:00]  Sodas  Whatever  I don't want  To talk to you  Well that's  That's what  Ferris Bueller said  Isn't it  Is that right  He said he didn't  Believe in isms  He's always quoting  Ferris Bueller  That's what I thought  That's what I read  Speaking of how difficult  It is to pronounce my name  I worked with the  Late great  Patrice O'Neill  A long time ago  Oh you did  And I was opening  For him  And he go  He gets on stage  And he goes  Moshe Kasher  Your name might as well  Be Jewish  Jewish  Every comedian 
[00:31:30]  Who worked with Patrice  There are still comedians  To this day  Who haven't gotten over  How much  How badly  He hurt their feelings  He treated me  He treated me with kid gloves  I think  Everybody was warning me  They were like  Patrice is an asshole  Beware  And we went out  To Chinese food  And crab  I was  Worshipful of that guy  So maybe that's why  I was just like  Hi sir  He picked up on it  And he was like  Okay  You kissed the rings  Okay there you go  Did you ever meet Patrice  No  Moshe just recently 
[00:32:00]  I had never seen him  Oh really  I don't know  I never saw him in LA  Yeah  He wasn't in LA much  The real shame about Patrice  What he showed me was  It's so good  It was very like  In the moment  But the real shame  About Patrice now  That he's passed away  Is like  The elephant in the room  Was amazing  Yeah  But the real magic  Of that guy  Was seeing him live  I mean there was some  He was able  He was able to do things  Like where women  Feminist women  Would be like  We do suck  You're right  Yeah  There's something amazing 
[00:32:30]  About it  There's that great  Viral clip that went on  When he was on Fox News  Oh yeah  Have you seen it  The video  It's all over YouTube  I'm on the side of funny  Was that the one  Yes exactly  But that's when he starts  Like bringing stuff up  That this feminist woman  Should be offended by  But he gets the cameraman  To start laughing  And then he starts going  Why are you laughing  She's offended  That was his last appearance  On Fox News  It was memorable  Let's go to Jason  In Minnesota  What's up Jason  What's going on

[00:35:00]  Natasha  Do you like  Performing for bros  Do you think  Dudes  Are they a tougher  Audience  Or are you  I mean I would say  The bro is my  Natural enemy  Yeah  You think so  So  No  No  On the bro  But  You know  If you can get them  To submit  It can be  It can be okay  If they show you  Their stomach  Like if they get  Down on the back  And they start  Rolling around  And they're like  Mama  That's how you  Know you've got them  You can get them there 
[00:35:30]  You should do  The bro whisperer  Figure out a way  How long was it  How long did you  Have to perform  Before you figured out  How to control  These bros like that  I mean I don't  Attract a lot of bros  I mean but  But I mean  You have to understand  It's going to happen  So like you have to  You know  Especially on Times  In Times Square  On St. Patrick's Day  I mean I don't know  What's going to happen  I think we're going to  Have to have some  Tight security  I think I might  You know  Have to  So you know  It can be good  Is bringing them  Up on stage  Sometimes I bring them 
[00:36:00]  Up on stage  And do like  An intense interview  And usually  They just kind of show  Speaking of bros  Yeah  That's DJ Who Kid  What's up Who Kid  What up  Who Kid  This is Natasha  And this is Moshe  So he just comes in  Halfway  He comes in whenever  He's wearing a hat  That says swagger advisory  And he  I have to say  Walked in with  A great deal of swagger  There's a reason  Why they call it  Negro  There's a reason  They call it  Black people time  It's true 
[00:36:30]  It's true what it is  Are you a Scientologist  Who Kid  No I'm a Negro  What is that  Oh that's what I was saying  Black people should be  Scientologists  Yeah that's true  But Will Smith is  I mean I'm a conspiracy theorist  I don't know about  Black people are conspiracy theorists  That's true  Illuminatists  Whatever  Here's one thing I know  About black people now  Because in Moshe  I know black people  Shouldn't be Scientologists  Yeah  They're all conspiracy theorists  Of course  And they're all  Terrified of magicians  I didn't say that  But that is true  It is true  Yeah  It is true  Poor people don't like 
[00:37:00]  Seeing coins  And like disappearing  Is that what it is  Give me that back  Right now  Get that  Get that shit out  From behind my ear  Oh that's a real good trick  Now where's my fucking coin  You better make another  One of those appear  Bitch  I'm already mad  We ain't got a nigga pope man  I'm so mad  Did that disappoint you?  We got a nigga president  But no nigga pope man  Right  I'm upset about it too  It's whack man  That would have been cool man  Yeah  Would have been good  We were saying he would have been pope dope  Can you imagine like all those people fainting  Yeah totally 
[00:37:30]  They would have been like  Ah  In world news today  Catholicism has dropped its membership by 50%  Natasha's looking at you puzzled  I think she's wondering why you walked in  And within 15 seconds  The n-word quotient in the room  Why not by 100,000%  We're all naturally niggas  We're niggas too  Yeah  That's actually what Patrice said  I didn't know if I could drop an n-bomb on the air  But he didn't say Jewish-Jewish  He said  Your name might as well be Jewish-Jewish nigga  And I was like  Oh my god  Thank you Patrice for calling me 
[00:38:00]  I appreciate that  That's what happened  That's going to be hype right now  Yeah  But titties are shaking right now  But who the kid comes on here all the time  And he  Believe it or not  Most of the audience to this show  Is indeed white people  A lot of people have trouble  Yeah I know Moshe  A lot of people have trouble with that  But what happens is  That now this whole group of white listeners and fans  Come when who kid is DJing somewhere  And they all call it  Nigga  I love it  You do like it  I'm a racist too 
[00:38:30]  But you only like it if it's nigga  Yeah  But I became white what  Like seven years ago  How do you  What was the transformation process like  You started with a personality test  Oh yeah  That too  But when I had Donald Trump on my shoulder  The racist situation just attacked me  And just  He attacked you  Yeah he's very racist  Donald Trump is racist  He put it on me  This ointment of racism  What did he say to you  He said yo you're a real nigga  I was like wow  Donald Trump said that  Yeah  Wow  You also have to know it 
[00:39:00]  He seems so cool  That's so weird  Betty White too  Betty White called you a nigga  Come on  What a lot of people don't know  Like everybody knows that who kid is black  A lot of people don't know he's a liar too  Like he lies constantly  Oh you're just straight up a liar  Yeah  He's constantly making up fibs  I'm a nigga  He just says things sometimes  Let me go to Brad in Hoboken  Yeah I just wanted to say  That that show that Natasha's on  Burning Love  When she did stand up on that  Was probably the funniest thing  I've seen in a long time  When she said her pussy  Was as tight as a toddler  How can you say 
[00:39:30]  That was a character  You're not  Somebody that bros would be into  Every bro wants to hear a girl  Say my pussy's as tight as a toddler  Wow  Thank you  It is funny  She's hilarious on Burning Love  People should check it out  Where can they check it out?  On E  Or on Yahoo  On Mondays  On E  Well I took it off Yahoo  Because now it's on the internet  Or it's on E  TV's still better than the internet right?  I don't know  I think maybe not  Not if you want to find somebody  Who's pussy is tighter than a toddler  Right  You can literally find a toddler's pussy 
[00:40:00]  On the internet  That's not available on the television  Whoa  To ease credit  Although you should get satellite TV  Because you can find  It's got a lot of channels  To ease credit  To ease credit  I think that was on  They said that on E  Real?  I was just about to ask that  I didn't even think of that  But  That's nuts  Well see what happens now  Is they're like  On the internet  It's like a breeding ground  And they're creating these things  And then the networks see  That these people have created  Something funnier  Than what they could create  With all their cooks 
[00:40:30]  And corporations  And then they just buy it  And put it on  So instead of saying  We've got to figure out  Who's coming up with these great ideas  And hire them  They're like  Oh well you have to buy that idea  Yeah  So it's kind of a cool new thing  That's happening  And I think  It's going to be happening  More and more  That's good  It's very good  Because it wouldn't have happened that way  If E would have  I mean no offense  But they would have tried to cast it  And put it together  And especially based on that joke  I don't think it would have made it  On to E  Before the internet  Yeah  She looks like she has  A small vagina though 
[00:41:00]  I'm curious  Do you or is that just the character  You look like you have a small dick  It looks like it's probably very large  I imagine it's big  I'm going to look at my pants  You don't have to  Is your vagina smaller  Or is that just the character  Here we go Natasha  I was just telling Moshe  Like whenever you do radio  As a woman  It always comes to like  People want to know  How you finger yourself  My lord  People want to know  How big it is  How big that pussy Natasha  I wouldn't have asked the question  If you hadn't have gone on television 
[00:41:30]  And said my pussy's as tight  As a toddler  But I was playing a character  That was a lie  Although when she did  Fresh Air with Terry Gross  She also asked her  How big her pussy was  It's radio  Across the board  It's just  God damn it  Terry Gross  I'm always trying to get  In the headlines  Serious fallopian tubes  Right there  That was good  Andy in Pittsburgh  Hey Moshe's exactly right  When there's a saying in the street  That you can't call it a con  So when Will Smith goes there 
[00:42:00]  And gets conned into Scientology  He just seems to lose all street cred  Except that you're saying  That Will Smith is a con  Do you just want to do quotes sir?  I think he's saying that  Black people shouldn't be able  To get hustled  Yeah it's true  And I think  Will Smith seems so smart  I guess they're probably all smart  Will Smith seems so white  I mean  He's gay too  So maybe that's why  I thought he's married with children  Oh come on  Whatever  Am I naive? 
[00:42:30]  You don't hear her?  She knows  She knows what I'm talking about  No he seems pretty  He seems pretty gay  Will if you're listening  Will you call in  And just let us know  If you are a homosexual  We are curious  Also if you want to do  A little guest spot  On one of our shows  Sunday's open  Sunday would be a good night  So Will Smith  Will be at Caroline's  On Sunday  Roland's gay too  Ain't no wrong with that  Roland are you gay?  Do you guys know Roland?  No I'm gay  Oh okay I'm sorry Roland  I thought you were  I'm sorry  No of course not  It's okay Roland 
[00:43:00]  Roland's got quite a presence  You think so?  Quite an outfit  Looks like he's like  Just got done watering lawns  Well Roland is of course  You know with that body  You'd expect somebody  To wear workout pants  Do people know what he looks like?  Yes  People know what he looks like  I mean not today  He's Mexican  He's wearing his Brooklyn Nets  Workout pants  And his extremely large  Han Solo t-shirt  It's Han Duo 
[00:43:30]  You know you're cute  Everybody loves you  You know  You ever been in this  You know we were talking about  These DJs going over the top  And talking about vaginas  And things like that  To women  To women  Yeah  Because I'm not sitting there  Being like hey  By the way  Moshe how big is your dick?  Yeah but Moshe said it to who  Ken?  No but he said after  He asked me how tight my vagina was  But that's just what we were saying  And a woman can't come back  And be like  Oh really?  Well how big is your dick?  Because the DJ will be like  Oh my dick is big 
[00:44:00]  It's real nice  They don't feel as comfortable  No you want to see it honey?  My dick is right out right now  Get hyped right now  But you know people  You're talking about getting lathered up too right?  You know what the situation is  Who kid?  You're all lathered up right?  You're ready to shave  I didn't bathe yet  Oh you mean all the shaving  What do you mean lathered up?  You know you get lathered up  Prepared to shave  Follow me  Look at this shit  Keep going  Keep going  Keep talking  And you realize  Yeah Roland  Yeah  You forgot to buy blades  Oof  Yeah keep talking 
[00:44:30]  What do you do instead?  Put a little depilatory on that  Like a black dude?  No  No  Shave that shit  You suck  You start digging through the garbage can  Oof  No it's still sexy  Oh yeah  Yeah yeah yeah  Yeah keep talking  Yeah we're listening  Yeah and you look for old blades  Cause you gotta shave that face  Old blade  You gotta shave that face  But it's gonna zombie out your face  Isn't it?  Because it's an old blade  It's all worn down  So what do you do?  Nah  You realize  That you just had your dollar shave club moment  My friends  Oof  You just got there  Dollar shave club 
[00:45:00]  What's all the buzz about?  Everybody's asking  Moshe  Natasha  Who kids?  Is this a commercial?  No  It's a commercial  I always read things  Here's what all the buzz is about  Everybody buys razor blades  All the time  Moshe you buy razor blades  Sure I do  I'm a man aren't I?  But they're so expensive  They are expensive  More than a dollar  Is there a way to get her teeth?  Well the thing is  Natasha  You may not know this  But men don't actually need  Vibrating handles on their razor blades 
[00:45:30]  They don't need like you know  The ten blades  And the back scratchers  And all this nonsense  They just need a good razor blade  Right?  You gotta shave that little pussy  You gotta shave that toddler pussy  Right  And you have to shave toddler pussy  Did your sponsor into this?  I don't know for sure  Maybe we'll do a little editing  Before we send off the spot  But  I forgot this is a commercial  But it's not  It's just natural dialogue  But what you can do now  You're doing a great job  Thank you  What you can do now  Do you know anything about stamps.com?  No  No  I don't know anything about that website
