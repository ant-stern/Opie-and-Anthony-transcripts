<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a multi-part segment centered around a caller named Ashley from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, who claimed to have slept with her 38-year-old father's married best friend.  The hosts connected Ashley live with her mother, Janice, resulting in a highly emotional and graphic conversation.  While Ashley initially defended her actions, it was later revealed the entire incident was a hoax orchestrated by Ashley and Nina from Tennessee, who had obtained Janice's phone number to facilitate the prank.  Than and Sam from the Than and Sam show were present in the studio during this segment.  The hosts punctuated the conversation with humorous and crude remarks.  A separate, earlier prank call involving Ashley, Janice, and a character named Fred was also part of this segment, with Fred's acting being heavily criticized.

Following this, the show addressed Big Kev's strong body odor, acknowledging his medical condition and recent weight loss surgery as contributing factors.  Big Kev eventually called in, clarifying the situation and receiving an apology.  This was followed by a segment featuring clips from Intern Ricky's college radio show, highlighting his poor understanding of sarcasm and nervous demeanor during a book report.

Next, clips from an interview conducted by Martini Steve with Master Poe concerning a hurricane evacuation plan for the radio station provided comedic relief due to Master Poe's literal interpretation of the scenario.  This was followed by Jim Norton answering questions from *Cosmopolitan* magazine's advice column.

A segment featuring recurring character Jimmy answering listener questions with blunt and crude responses followed. This was succeeded by a "no homo" bit centered around intern Bobby, involving several other interns (Sean, Nathaniel, John, and Bill) and featuring explicit descriptions of Bobby's sexually suggestive behavior.

The show then featured a guest appearance by Milla Jovovich, discussing her film career, including *The Fifth Element* and *Resident Evil*, her upbringing in Russia, and suggestive photos of herself.  This was followed by a major confrontation between Opie and Anthony and Earl, a producer from the Ron and Fez show, stemming from the accidental erasure of the show's Grammy Awards recording due to an unauthorized channel change on the main TV in Opie and Anthony's office.  The argument escalated to the point where Earl ran out of the building, pursued by Opie and Anthony's staff, before eventually returning and apologizing.  Several staff members, including Steve, Ben, Eastside Dave, and Master Poe, were involved in the argument and its aftermath.  Wiki, from D.C. headquarters, was also mentioned as directing Master Poe's intervention.  The hosts heavily criticized Earlâ€™s perceived incompetence and the ongoing issues caused by Earl and his team's actions. The argument involved accusations of lying and dishonesty, drawing comparisons to Bill Clinton's infamous statement regarding his affair.  The broadcast concluded with further discussion of the incident, staffing issues, office upgrades, and banter involving the hosts, Master Poe, and a guest named Travis.

Oh, this is a four-parter.  Ooh.  This was one of the very first things that happened on the Opie and Anthony Show a long, long time  ago in 2004.  Ah, okay.  When I say the Opie and Anthony Show, I mean XM.  Yes.  Do you remember Ashley?  Mm-hmm.  Do you?  Or are you just saying that? 
[00:01:30]  No, I do.  Sam?  Ashley Tisdale?  Yes.  Ashley Tisdale called into the program and claimed...  That's not who it was.  Anyway, she claimed to have slept with her dad's friend.  Of course.  I remember this bit.  It was quite an operatic experience.  This was an epic.  It lasted a few days.  And this is part one on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Let's say hi to Ashley in PA.  Ashley. 
[00:02:00]  Hi.  Hi.  Hi.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  I'm doing really good.  Me too.  Mm.  Ashley.  Mm.  Ashley.  That's a name only a hot girl can have.  That's right.  You can't be fat and say, hi, I'm Ashley.  How hot is Ashley?  I'm pretty hot.  Pretty hot?  Uh-huh.  Where are you from?  Pennsylvania?  Hazleton, yeah.  Hazleton.  Okay.  Not far from Redding.  No.  And why are you calling the show today?  Well, I want to probably call your mom, but mine is real. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, you want to confess something to your mom?  Uh-huh.  I slept with my dad's best friend last night.  How old are you?  Old enough.  How old are you?  19.  How old is your dad's best friend?  He's 38.  I want to whack my bag.  Is this real?  Yeah.  So how did this come about?  Well, I liked him for a while and I just, I don't know.

Uh, she's all right, I guess.  And did you, uh, did you, um, make the move or did he?  We both did.  Both did.  So he's been coming over the house a lot?  Um, we've been meeting in a secret location. 
[00:03:30]  Ooh, secret.  It's a secret.  It is.  Is it a parking lot?  No.  What kind of a location?  You don't have to give away the location.  What kind?  A hotel.  Ah, the old hotel.  Yeah.  He's pulling the old Butterfuco on her.  Is this a real story?  I swear, yeah.  All right, let's get her mom on the phone, but you got to tell the mom that she's going  to come on the radio, all right?  Do we have your mom's number?  Yeah.  Uh, no, I got to give it to you.  All right, hold on.  Do it off the air or else everybody will be calling.  Hold on. 
[00:04:00]  Uh-huh.  They're getting nervous in Washington.  Relax.  We got to tell the mom that she's on the air.  We know all the laws.  Oh, wait, get Ben in here.  Hold on.  Mm-hmm.  Just say it's a radio show and, you know, your daughter has something cute she wants to  tell you.  Something cute.  All right.  All right, Ben.  Uh, Janice?  Yes?  How are you?  Pretty good.  All right.  Um, are you familiar with the Opie and Anthony show?  No.  Oh, okay.  It's a cute little radio show we do. 
[00:04:30]  Okay.  We're pretty, um, harmless.  Okay.  And, uh, your daughter's on the line and she wants to tell you something.  Okay.  Hope that's where she was.  Any idea in your head what it might be?  Hopefully where the hell she was last night.  Ah.  Why is that?  Was she missing?  Well, she was supposed to come home by like one o'clock because that's her curfew.  And I've been lying to her dad all fucking night about where she's been.  And, um, I'm a little pissed.  Does, uh, does she live with you still? 
[00:05:00]  Yes.  Uh, she's got a little room that she's had since, what, she was a little kid?  Mm-hmm.  Yeah.  Set up the same way.  Stuffed animals and stuff.  Yeah, she's still stuffed animals.  And how old is she?  19.  And where was, uh, where did she say she was going last night?  She was going out to the movies and dinner.  And then she was going to be home after she went to some club up in Wilkes-Barre.  With friends did she go to the movies?  Yeah, that's what she said.  What friend?  Janine, why?  Oh, just wondering.  Uh, Janine's.  Janine's one of our good friends?  Yeah.  Yeah, Janine's, uh, she's a troublemaker, isn't she? 
[00:05:30]  Yeah, she can be.  Would rather not hang out with Janine.  A bad seed.  Yeah.  What, uh, what, uh, movie were they supposed to go see last night?  Like The Grudge or something like that.  Ah, it's a little scary movie.  Ah, yes.  All right, uh, let's put your daughter on the line here.  Okay.  This is Ashley.  Ashley!  Yeah?  Hi, uh, we got your mom Janice on the phone here.  And she's wondering what, uh, where you were last night until, uh, how late there, Mom?  She never fucking came home at all.  Oh, Jesus. 
[00:06:00]  You gotta be...  She's still not home.  She's still not home.  Well, maybe she's working.  Yeah, yeah.  Okay.  Oh, no.  Uh, Ashley?  Yeah?  Would you like to tell your mother where you were last night?  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Mom?  Yes?  Um, I...  God promised not to get mad and I don't want you to tell Dad what I'm gonna tell you.  I've been lying to him all night.  What else do you want me to lie to him about? 
[00:06:30]  Um...  Don't use any last names, by the way.  Okay.  I slept with Fred last night.  Fred?  Daddy's friend?  Yeah.  What are you out of your mind?  I'm friends with...  Oh!  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  I...  I don't...  Don't tell Dad.  Sure.  You tell Dad...  Oh.  And you're doing this to me on air?  Oh.  You're lucky your dad's never heard of this show.  Or he'd be in state pen by tonight because he'll come... 
[00:07:00]  What are you getting all mad about?  His age and your age and you're my baby and he's fucking a baby?  Well, you're not, but you are.  You're my kid.  Well, Ashley, what happened last night?  Well, we went out to eat and we went out to a movie and then he took me to the hotel and...  We fooled her out.  You don't have to worry about me telling your dad. 
[00:07:30]  I'm going to go fucking kill him.  What's this guy like, Janice?  Well, see, I guess...  Two-faced, I would say.  He's been eating dinner here.  He's been eating dinner across the table with you since you're two years old.  Oh, my God.  I can't help it.  I'm attracted to him.  You're attracted to him.  Wait, you fooled her out.  You just kissed him, right?  No, we went all the way.  You slut. 
[00:08:00]  Is this the first...  I'm not a slut.  It's my first time doing it.  What the fuck are you freaking out for?  Because he's 38 years old.  He just had his birthday.  Are you friends with this guy's wife?  Yes, I am.  And Lisa is not going to be...  Oh, my God.  Lisa is your godmother.  How am I going to even try and tell her this?  Lisa, the guy's wife is the godmother of your daughter?  Yes.  Oh, my God.  It's a very sacred position to the Sicilian people. 
[00:08:30]  Ashley, you've been fooling around with him a while or no?  I've fooled around with him a couple times, yeah.  But this was the first time you went all the way last night?  Yeah.  And it was in a seedy hotel somewhere?  Yeah, it's in Hazleton.  Yeah, every hotel here is seedy.  Mom, what are you going to do?  Are you going to tell the wife, maybe?  No.  Mom, you better not...  I don't want you to tell anybody.  I just didn't want you to tell anybody.  Don't tell anybody.  You take me on the radio and you don't want me to tell anybody. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, you have some nerve.  Oh, my God.  Hey, Ashley, was he good?  No.  Ashley was.  He better damn well be because now you are out.  What do you mean, I'm out?  You can go live with him after he gets a divorce.  Well, fuck it.  Then I will.  Yeah, you will.  This is bullshit.  Ashley, I did not raise you like this.  What happened at the college?  Are you going to still go? 
[00:09:30]  Are you going to still have a life?  Or are you going to just hook up with some old man and live off of him for the rest of your freaking life?  He makes good money.  Well, you know what?  You're smarter than that, and you're being a complete moron right now.  Complete moron.  And this is the something cute you had to tell me.  Jesus fucking Christ.  Oh, my God.  Calm down.  My blood pressure is shooting up faster than anything.  You know, you're going to put me in my fucking grave. 
[00:10:00]  I'm not that old, but I'm going to be going in my fucking grave soon.  Can I ask a question?  Uh-huh.  Not to be Ashley?  Yeah.  Was he a big boy?  Yeah.  Fucking Christ.  I hope it was worth it.  That's all I got to tell you.  It better fucking have done well done.  Worth it.  Was he cut or uncut?  He's cut. 
[00:10:30]  What position did you enjoy?  I was mostly on my back.  Oh, my God.  Yeah.  That's great.  Eating dinner over your house.  Now he's eating somewhere else.  Oh, God.  Mom, please don't tell Dad.  No.  Yeah, like, I want to lose a husband.  Mm-hmm.  Why would you lose a husband?  Because he'll fucking kill him.  Why?  That's his best friend and his daughter. 
[00:11:00]  So what's the problem?  Wouldn't you want to fucking kill him?  I mean, right now, I'm, like, getting ready to go to his job and blow his fucking head off.  Oh, boy.  That'd be the second time in two days he's had that done.  I hear a kid in the background.  I enjoy my way, though.  Fucking little bitch.  So did you notice there was some flirting going on there, Mom?  No.  No?  And what's going on with the kid in the background?  I have babies that are crying.  And this is your oldest? 
[00:11:30]  That's my oldest.  Ashley is your oldest.  And I'm hoping, you know what?  He's never allowed in this fucking house again.  Because how is he going to go after my 12-year-old?  Is he going to go after my fucking 2-year-old now?  No.  Or what?  Maybe he'll go after your brother.  You got a little farm there for him.  Yeah, they really...  It's like the Expos of pedophiles.  So what are you going to do to keep from raising another slut?  Fucking lock him up.  You home after school.  You just come home after school. 
[00:12:00]  Could you quiet that baby the same way they quieted the baby at the end of Caligula?  Oh, my God.  Last episode of MASH.  Mom, I'm just going to come home and we'll talk.  Bok, bok, bok, bok, bok, bok.  You can't come home.  Wouldn't be quiet.  I've been up all night.  Not only with the baby, but walking the fucking halls, waiting for your ass to come in this door.  Well, she was getting laid.  And you're out.  You know something?  I wouldn't believe this unless it was some shithole in Pennsylvania that they were coming from. 
[00:12:30]  The fact that it's Hazleton.  I know.  It's totally...  I believe this could happen there.  Yeah.  All right, Ashley.  Anything else you want to say to your mom?  No, but I want to play what's in my pants.  Oh, you've got to go.  You know what?  Your bags will be at the fucking steps when you get home.  She's...  Your mom's heartbroken.  I did not raise my child to do stuff like this.  Oh, boy. 
[00:13:00]  You might live in a town where fucking people walk around and do shit that God only knows what.  But I raised you better than that.  Apparently not.  Mom, would you play a game of mother-daughter once in my pants?  Jimmy.  Not a bad idea.  Why not?  All right, well...  Well, it looks like you guys got some things to work out there, huh?  Oh, yeah.  I'll come home and we'll talk.  Oh, yeah.  Come home.  Yeah, we'll talk.  How many times did you guys have sex last night, Ashley? 
[00:13:30]  Four.  Yeah, we're going to talk.  Four?  About four.  About four times.  Not bad.  Not bad for the old guy.  Did he rub his helmet on your brown eye?  Yeah.  Did he try anything, like, freaky?  No, no.  Like, the whole situation isn't freaky enough.  No, he was nice about it.  Yeah, he was a real gentleman.  And does he like you?  I think.  All right. 
[00:14:00]  Janice, you all right?  Yeah.  Oh, boy.  She's just reflecting, looking at her other children, thinking, you know, who's next?  Yeah.  You're not necessarily going to fail with the other ones, too.  Oh, I cry.  What?  I don't want to cry.  Don't cry.  You just basically told me that everything that we've been living and everything, I thought  we could trust these people, and apparently we can't.  I've known them for that long, and this is the way they're going to be. 
[00:14:30]  Yeah, it's one of those things, you know, I'm sure she's upset she can't get the image  out of her head of this guy just on top of her little girl, you know, pounding away.  And that's an image that will probably stick with her for quite a while, both of them just  naked.  Yeah, and your descriptions are so helpful.  Get that image out of your head.  Sorry, I was just trying to convey that, you know, it's probably very upsetting to you.  All the trust, the holidays spent together, her little teenage body, just wanting and wanting.  And a couple of years ago, you remember her like, you know, the little girl. 
[00:15:00]  Right.  And now all of a sudden she's a young woman, and this guy that you've entrusted is just  ravening her in a hotel room.  Yeah, just fouling your daughter over and over again.  Now you're running back through your mind, thinking of all the times he was over that  you might have thought he was looking at her a little weird.  Oh.  When she was 13, maybe?  Yeah, now I'm worried that he's looking at my other children.  Well, then dress him better.  All right, Ashley, any final thoughts there? 
[00:15:30]  No, I'll be home and we can talk about it then.  Yeah, you need to come home so we can talk about it.  Yeah, and you need to come home, like, soon, okay?  Yeah.  Mommy's not mad at you, not at all.  Oh, boy.  Ashley, where are you now?  I'm at the hotel.  Which hotel?  The one right down the street or by the mall?  The one by the mall.  The one by the mall.  Okay, why don't you just wait there and I'll come get you. 
[00:16:00]  Oh, boy.  Ashley, are you attractive?  She's a beautiful girl.  Does she have email?  Oh.  Jimmy.  All right, Ashley.  Janice, thank you.  Oh.  I didn't know this was going to happen today.  Ashley said she just wanted to tell you something on the show today.  Yeah.  I didn't know it was going to be this.  But we told you there was a prize attached and you actually win Dr. Spock's book on how  to be a better parent. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah, I should have used it 19 years ago.  Right across her ass.  Either that or a hanger.  Yeah.  Or how to choose better, Frit.  You just got it.  Are you going to come pick me up for what?  Yeah, I'm coming to get you.  All right.  All right, we're going to need an update on this story.  So why don't you guys call us tomorrow or Thursday or something, all right?  Oh, you want to put Ashley on hold because Eric wants her number.  We're going to put Ashley on hold and Janice, we're going to put you on hold, all right? 
[00:17:00]  Okay.  We're putting you both on hold.  All right.  Shut up.  All right.  Thanks, Janice.  Oh, you're welcome.  And there they go.  Oh, that was good.  Hmm.  Interesting.  I mean, I don't know what to make of that story.  Oh, God.  Is it Jimmy?  Jimmy?  I have a full rod.  He is all like...  How does he...  How does he get a rod from that one?  Janice?  Just hearing mommy's tears.  Janice?  Yes?  Jim has a full rod after listening to this story.  I'm not some 38-year-old creep, though.  He's 35. 
[00:17:30]  36.  36.  36-year-old creep.  And he was very turned on by your daughter's story.  How are you going to confront this guy?  No.  I don't even know.  I say just tell his fucking wife and let her freaking deal with him.  All right.  Why don't we call the wife?  Hey, do you have her number?  You want to call the wife?  Oh, I would never do that to Lisa.  I'd never do anything like that.  Why don't you call Fred?  You don't have to do it to Lisa.  Why don't you call Fred?  Oh, that's a good one.  He's at work right now.  Exactly.  Yeah, that'd be great.  Let's confront Fred at work.  Why not? 
[00:18:00]  The way he used your trust just to get your little, you know, meet me down the street  of the hotel.  All right, take care, parents.  Meet me down the street of the hotel.  You know what he must have been thinking when he saw that 18-year-old ass?  Yeah.  The 19-year-old ass for the first time?  Yeah, truly turned 19-year-old.  Just turned 19.  Phone rings once for the signal.  She meets him outside by the sycamore tree.  It's the worst.  The Opie and Anthony.  Down with the sickness! 
[00:18:30]  All right, we're back with the Opie and Anthony show.  Controversy has broken out on the O&A show.  Ashley was on the line about 15 minutes ago claiming that she slept with her father's best friend. 
[00:19:00]  She wanted to tell her mom.  We got the mom on the phone.  And very awkward phone call to listen to.  But we got to be honest.  Half the listeners are completely buying it.  And the other half are not buying it whatsoever.  We're divided in here, too.  Yeah, we're kind of on the fence in here.  I don't know.  You know, I love to think it's real.  I sure would.  Right.  But I don't know.  We still have Ashley on the line.  And we're going to try to get to the bottom of this.  She can't hear us right now.  And we're going to make believe, like, you know, where someone from the legal department or something from XM Saturday Radio wants to get to the bottom of this. 
[00:19:30]  Okay?  Yeah.  So why don't we get her?  Okay.  Ashley?  Yeah.  Hi.  This is Chuck Schick from XM Legal.  Hey.  How are you doing?  We need to fill out some forms regarding the content of your conversation on the air.  Okay.  And we absolutely need to know if it was true or false. 
[00:20:00]  Because there could be legal ramifications for the program.  So it's not for the air.  We just want to know if this really did happen or not.  It's fine either way.  Yeah.  So you're saying this absolutely did happen?  It happened.  Okay.  And you were telling your mom for the first time?  Yeah.  Okay.  Check that. 
[00:20:30]  Because, you know, we don't want to be sued.  No, I'm...  This side, you know.  So if it's true, we will then write down that it is indeed true.  And if not, that's fine too.  But you're saying this absolutely did happen and your confrontation with your mother was absolutely legitimate.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, thank you very much.  Okay, thanks.  And please hold.  Uh, Janice?  Yeah? 
[00:21:00]  There's your confirmation.  That's real.  You shameless hustler.  Okay.  Lou.  Lou.  Right.  Lou, Mary.  Oh, Mary has sex with Lou.  Mary and Lou.  The Ted Knight sounds like that.  Oh, Mary.  Oh.  Marie.  Mary has sex with Lou.  All the trust that we put in Lou.  He slept with Mary.  Jesus. 
[00:21:30]  Well.  Ashley, you need to be in the lobby in 15 minutes because I will be there for you.  Okay.  Just tell her there's a 38-year-old cock waiting for her and I'm sure she'll be right there.  All right.  Well, I'm sorry to hear that this is actually true.  I can't believe this.  Yeah.  You guys got some talking to do.  Some healing.  And you know what, Janice?  And if you need it, we do have Jerry Springer's number.  If that'll help you out.  I'll say I'm sorry to hear that it's true, but then there's a part of me that's glad it is  because I'd hate to think I got a fat boner for nothing. 
[00:22:00]  All right, Janice.  Any final thoughts?  Because we have to move on.  Yeah.  Take care of yourselves and each other.  That's right.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  We're going to let them be.  Wait, Janice?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Two yeses.  Two yeses and you hang up on her.  Wow.  All right.  It's the worst.  I will be in Anthony. 
[00:22:30]  All right.  You guys want an update on Ashley?  Who?  Ashley from yesterday who told her mom.  This was the real deal.  We weren't buying it, but then we were able to confirm that this actually happened.  Yeah.  We had Ashley call.  She's 19 years old.  She's had a crush on her father's best friend for a while.  I guess the best friend, the father's best friend is her godfather too, right?  Or something like that?  Well, I know that the best friend, the one that had sex with the daughter, his wife, because 
[00:23:00]  he's married.  Right.  Is the godmother.  Oh, okay.  Okay.  Of the girl that he had sex with.  So I don't know if he's the godfather.  Yeah.  So basically this guy's been coming to the house since Ashley was like two or something.  And Ashley's mom and dad are good friends with this guy and his wife.  Don Corleone.  It is an honor to have sex with your daughter on the day of your daughter's wedding.  I like when you put that in my mouth from your grandson, Frank. 
[00:23:30]  Can I fuck your daughter for old time's sake?  And the dick she sucked was a masculine dick.  You can act like a whore!  What's the matter with you?  So we have an update here.  Uh-huh.  Ashley decided to tell her mom live on our show.  She was the greatest piece of ass I've ever had, and I've had him all over the world.  Wow.  And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. 
[00:24:00]  What days did you have sex with him?  Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday.  Yeah, so she decided to tell her mom live on our show.  And we had the wacky bit alert happening in our heads.  But it turns out it was the real deal.  So we were able to confirm it.  But we have Ashley on the line to give us an update.  And I hear it's not going to be a good update here.  So once again, to the program, we go with Ashley. 
[00:24:30]  Hey, Ashley!  Oh, wait a minute, Ashley.  Damn it.  Hold on.  Ashley!  Yeah.  Okay, you're there.  Hello.  What's going on?  They threw me out before I got the shit kicked out of them.  I don't know if my mom called Lisa or not.  She said she did, but Lisa's in St. Petersburg, so...  All right, let's back up.  Who's he?  So, after the show, you went home? 
[00:25:00]  Yeah.  And I heard that your stuff was all over the lawn?  No.  Huh?  No.  Oh, that's what Eric was saying.  Did you get thrown out?  Yeah, they threw me out.  And where are you staying?  I'm at the hotel now, but I think I'm just going to go stay with a couple of friends.  And what happened to the guy?  My dad went after him.  Oh, how did he find out?  My mom told him.  She wound up telling him. 
[00:25:30]  You wrecked a friendship that probably goes back 20 years.  Well...  Eh, who cares?  He got laid.  So now what are you going to do?  That's the only important thing.  What are you going to do now?  Probably stay with friends.  I don't know.  So why would you call the show and announce this to the world?  I wanted to be a little bitch, I guess.  Backfire to my face.  You wanted to be a little bitch?  Yeah.  Get back at your parents for a little something?  Yeah.  Why would you want to do that to your mom?  Did your mom do something to you? 
[00:26:00]  No, she's just been ragging on me lately.  Yeah.  Yeah, when they rag on you, you've got to have sex with a family friend.  Exactly.  Boy, you really showed her.  Now you're living in a seedy hotel.  Well, and with friends.  What do you look like?  I don't know.  I'm good looking.  I have real long brown hair, blue eyes.  I'm about 5'2".  All right.  The important thing.  How much do you weigh? 
[00:26:30]  The last time I weighed myself, I was 107.  107.  Okay.  That's good.  Very nice.  So you're not a fat girl?  No.  Because I'm not saying it's wrong to ruin a family friendship, but you just got to not  do it over a fat girl.  No, no.  Have you talked to the guy?  Yeah.  Yeah, we were together again last night.  Oh, you were, were you?  Is he footing the bill for the hotel?  Yeah.  Wait, so did your father find him?  Yeah.  And it beat him up a little bit? 
[00:27:00]  Yeah, my dad gave him a pretty good beating.  And that, and then you had sex with the guy again last night?  Yeah, we were, uh, he said that he'd get me an apartment, but he'd pay for it.  I don't know.  So did you bang him after he was all beat up over there?  It's so sad.  My nose is running.  Oh, all right.  And I'm trying to signal that I need the paper towels that are right in front of Ben, and  they're like looking at everything.  What do you need? 
[00:27:30]  You need something for the show?  Well, I just didn't know, you're looking at Ben, and Ben's turning the page, so I thought  you wanted me to signal Ben.  I was really going to get him back.  I tried to talk him in the scene.  Wait, so...  I was going to blow him over the radio.  You were?  What?  You should anyway.  What do you mean you were?  How about...  He's not here.  What's that?  I'm here.  Where is he?  Having his wounds tended to?  He went back, he went to work.  You were going to blow him on the radio?  Mm-hmm.  This gets better and better every day.  You know, you're right. 
[00:28:00]  Can we get your mom on the line while you blow...  Oh, my God.  Blow on the radio.  What I wanted to do, I wanted to get my mom on the other line, and if my dad was still  home, I wanted to get them both on the other line.  Why do you...  And tell them that I wanted to apologize to them, and I was going to blow them over the  radio and just say, here, fuck you.  Stay nuts.  All right.  Now, why do you hate your parents so much?  Because they rag on me all the time.  That isn't hating your parents.  That's just a fun little prank, Hopi.  And what kind of ragging do they do?  Go to school.  Don't dress like a slut. 
[00:28:30]  Get a job.  Clean your room.  Clean your room.  Get that older man's cock out of your mouth.  What kind of ragging could they possibly do?  The normal ragging.  What?  Well, you guys said, they're just constantly on my back about something.  What did...  No, I have nothing.  Did Fred get beat up badly?  Huh?  Did your dad belt Fred?  My dad got the shit out of him, yeah.  So, but would Fred go on the phone while your dad's on the other line and get a hummer 
[00:29:00]  like that?  Well, he won't...  That's why Fred wouldn't stick around.  He said he wasn't going to dip with him.  Oh, he's the one that put the kibosh on that whole thing.  All right, well...  You really want to get even with your parents.  Once you come to New York and blow a comedian, that will really...  I'm telling you, that will really bother them.  You know, you...  I think...  I can live with you, North.  She wants to live with you.  I couldn't have you live with me because I like living alone, but you could certainly  spend a couple evenings.  Okay.  Yeah, you know, we've got about 12 guys that work on the show. 
[00:29:30]  I think we could kind of just rotate you around a little bit.  You know, you're ripe for a career in porn.  This is perfect.  This is like a perfect resume.  Yeah, you really are a porn star in the making.  I mean, what are you going to do for a living, eventually?  What do you want to do with your life?  Small town, Pennsylvania.  She's going to go to the big city and just start hobbing knob.  Nice.  Wait, you got her mom on the line here?  Yeah, I have her on hold.  I mean, I have her off the air so she can't hear.  Okay, let's put the mom on the phone, too.  Mike is saying, when was the last time, she said the last time she weighed herself, she 
[00:30:00]  was 107.  When was that?  1982.  That was a little trickery she did.  She said, last time I weighed myself, it was 107.  Janice.  A couple days ago.  Nah, I'm kidding.  Janice, your daughter keeps calling us every day here.  Yeah.  So, what happened after the show?  Well, I called up Lisa and I told Lisa.  You did.  You told the wife of the guy.  Yeah.  And what did she, how did she react?  Oh, she was furious. 
[00:30:30]  She's actually getting on a plane to come home today.  Why was she in St. Petersburg?  Visiting her family.  You called her in St. Petersburg?  Yeah.  You ruined her vacation?  You couldn't tell her when she got back?  No, I don't think that's something you should wait on.  And what did she say?  She was furious.  She was furious with me, even.  Why?  What did you do?  Besides raising a slut.  Yeah, she was furious with me, and she was furious with her husband, and she's coming 
[00:31:00]  home to deal with him, and then I think she's going after my daughter.  And I guess your daughter was in the hotel again last night, or the motel, whatever?  Whatever.  I don't know where she is.  I kicked her out.  Oh, you haven't talked to her since?  No.  Now, you told your husband also?  Oh, yeah.  And what did he say?  Well, he disappeared.  And he came back later, and a couple hours later, he had some bloody knuckles, and he  said he took care of it.  Took care of it.  Did he throw his bloody gi in a dumpster? 
[00:31:30]  And claimed that his dog was in a fight?  That's a dog.  I'm still freaked out over that story.  Wow.  So, you haven't talked to your daughter since?  No.  What would you like to say to her?  I just can't believe that you would do something like this to me.  Yeah.  I've done my best to raise a decent family.  Where do you think you went wrong?  Not enough discipline?  It must have been. 
[00:32:00]  Not enough guidance?  I don't know.  I'm there.  I stayed home every day.  I let my husband go to work.  I stayed home with the kids.  I don't know.  You were home, but were you really there?  I don't know how to tell you this, but your daughter wanted to give your husband's friend  a BJ live on our show today.  Oh, my God.  But she wanted you on the other line.  She was going to say she was going to apologize, and then she was going to start sucking and 
[00:32:30]  say, fuck you.  Why is he doing this to me?  I'm not doing it to you.  I'm not doing it to myself.  Oh.  What have I done to you that you need to repay me like this?  Good question.  We wanted answered immediately.  Ragging on me?  Ragging on you?  I'm your freaking mother.  What else do you want me to do?  Oh, okay.  You could go ahead and do that.  I don't care if you play in traffic.  Ooh.  Easy with that harsh criticism.  Yeah, what kind of nagging do you do?  I expect certain things done, you know, like I don't expect to find her pile of laundry 
[00:33:00]  at the bottom of my steps so, you know, that everybody falls over it.  I don't expect her to let her makeup lay around all over the freaking house so that everyone  picks up.  Poor makeup.  I mean, it's not like I ask her to paint the house.  Yeah, just little chores you want her to do.  Right.  And I'd like her to be respectable, and I'd like her to get her work done, and I'd like  to get her grades up, and oh, but that's, I'm ragging on her.  It sounds like normal mother stuff, but your daughter doesn't think it's normal, and she 
[00:33:30]  needs to get back at you by having sex with her father's best friend.  Wow.  So you tell her to pick up her makeup and her semen-stained clothes off the floor?  Hey, are you using birth control, Sharon?  Shannon?  Whatever your name is.  What is her name?  Ashley.  Ashley.  I looked up at the phone line.  Well, for some reason, no names are typed in on the fucking phone thing.  Because the computer's down.  I told you that.  The computer's also for the phones? 
[00:34:00]  Yeah.  This fucking place.  Jesus Christ.  I'm calling her Bill because I see a name Bill up on the screen.  What do I know?  How about you use your memory?  I'm in the moment.  I'm not thinking about fucking names.  I'm thinking about what I'm going to talk about.  This is one of the biggest freaking stories we've had in the first six weeks.  And with all the whores that we have on this show, have me use fake fucking names.  Am I supposed to remember goddamn aliases?  I want to ask a question.  That's important.  I'm looking at instant feedback. 
[00:34:30]  Her name's Jim D.  It's Hey, Would You Blow Me on line five.  What do I know?  Oh, you know you fucked your mother for a nickel.  We're going to play that in a minute.  Listen, you.  There you go, rat bastard.  Ashley?  Yeah?  Do you like wiffle ball?  No.  Oh.  Would you be willing to come to New York?  Yeah.  You want to come visit us?  Uh, maybe.  I don't like that.  How about a yes? 
[00:35:00]  I'd like to get a gander at you.  We'll put you up in a nice hotel.  Get an older gentleman to come in and have sex with you.  Oh, gosh.  No?  All right.  Well, Ashley, what do you want to say to your mom today?  I'm not going to stop doing it.  I don't care how mad you guys get, how worse it gets.  I'm not stopping.  She's loving this because she's winning.  She's winning right now.  I think she's loving it because she's...  If I could talk him into doing it, I'm definitely going to blow him over the radio. 
[00:35:30]  And I don't give a shit what she says.  Wow, man.  Wow, she's finally getting the attention she wanted her whole life.  This is the attention.  It's good.  What's mom's name again?  Janice.  All right, Pat McGroin.  Janice.  Yes.  Are you all right?  No, I'm here.  Oh, boy.  Yeah.  I think you're going to have to give up on this one.  A lot of people are suggesting cool songs we could be playing in the background. 
[00:36:00]  But no, we can't.  Our computer's broken.  I thought the computer's back up.  Pink Floyd's mother keeps turning on and off.  You can play Pink Floyd's mother.  Ashley, did you guys fool around after your dad spoke with Fred?  Yeah, it was about two hours afterwards.  You've got to like this Fred.  This kid, this guy's got some gumption.  He's got a lot of spunk and it's all in her.  Did he have any injuries?  Wait, wait.  No, you know what?  He mailed me real good doggy style too. 
[00:36:30]  Oh, my God.  Took out his aggressions that Dad took out on him.  He took it out on me.  I can't take this anymore.  You are so foul.  I can't believe you.  Took out the aggression.  Wow, that is real interesting.  Was he all cut up and banged up?  Yeah.  Yeah.  You made him feel better though, right?  What did he say when he was banging doggy style? 
[00:37:00]  He wasn't saying anything.  Yeah.  He was moaning with pleasure and delight.  Wow.  Wow, there's nothing to say after that, huh, Mom?  Hey, Ashley, you haven't spoken to your father, have you?  No.  No.  Where is he right now?  Daddy, no, he's not home.  He went to work.  He works like he has been for the past 20 years of you being alive.  No.  Supporting.  He works to support that beautiful 19-year-old ass. 
[00:37:30]  That's right.  Who his friend is violating.  So she can buy her whore clothes.  Oh.  That's where it's hard-earned money is going to.  You know what?  You can finish paying for school yourself.  I'm not paying for that either.  Put a roof over her head.  Go ahead.  Stop paying for college and see what I do.  I'll be really vindictive.  You know what?  I'm not paying for anything for you.  What could she possibly do?  I'm right in front of myself.  What are you going to do?  Give birth on the air for me?  You know what?  I don't care anymore.  What could you more do to me?  We tried to do that bit years ago, but it didn't work out. 
[00:38:00]  What else could you possibly do to me?  I'll screw you.  I mean, people that I didn't even know knew right away who the hell we were.  I went to the supermarket yesterday.  Oh, my God.  The people look at me.  So you're going to screw them right in front of your mom now?  Yeah.  If she quit paying for college, I'm going to be an asshole.  Going to be an asshole.  When he starts.  You might want to give up that.  You took that back about six years ago when you started.  Ooh.  Ooh. 
[00:38:30]  All right.  This is getting very uncomfortable, so I don't know what to tell you, Janice.  No, I don't know.  All right.  I washed my hands of her.  Yeah.  I'm done.  All right.  And, Ashley, any final thoughts here?  No, I said if I could talk Fred into it, I'll call you back.  All right.  Oh, what a little slut.  Do you think Fred's wife is going to come and knock on the hotel doors?  There's a whore in your hotel!  Oh, I'll bring her right to the air.  Right to the hotel.  There's a whore in your building!  That's what the police is going to do.  I'll bring her right to the hotel. 
[00:39:00]  She's so furious, I hope she rips every strand of your hair out.  Mm.  No.  All right.  All right.  I guess there's the update everyone was asking for today.  It hasn't gotten much better today, right, Ant?  No.  All right.  Well, Ashley, good luck to you.  All right.  Thanks.  And, Janice, I don't know what to tell you.  What, what, Eric?  Oh, put them on hold?  Can you do that?  Place them on hold?  Yeah, put them on hold.  Shut up.  Can you do that?  Or is the computer broken?  We can place them on hold. 
[00:39:30]  Place more gooder than put.  How come there's no names up there for Anthony to look at?  I don't know.  It's a mess today.  All right, guys.  Thank you.  Bye.  All right.  There goes the mom.  And, Ashley, thank you.  Let's go to Patio Furniture on line three, Opie.  All right.  Wow.  That situation is getting worse.  Son of a bitch.  That situation is getting worse, huh?  Yeah, it doesn't look very good over there.  And trust me, that's the real deal. 
[00:40:00]  We know for sure.  She's a little twisted that she wants to do all this on the air.  But who are we to say no?  I want to meet her.  Instant feedback from Middletown, how she could actually get more vindictive and cause  her parents more hurt than what she's done.  She should blow a black guy on the air.  That's what our listeners are saying, not me.  I just read it.  All right.  You're right.  I do believe it's accurate, but.  The worst of Opie and Anthony.  Ah.  Ashley's back.  I defy the New York papers to give her the coverage you gave. 
[00:40:30]  Oh, and the papers have her as the youngest girl to ever bang her father's friend.  Ashley.  Yeah.  What's going on today?  I'm in my parents' house.  And I'm up in their room on their bed.  And I'm going to blow them and make them, when he's ready to come, I want them to come  all over their sheets.  And then we're going to leave.  Okay.  Hold on.  The guy is there with you?  Fred?  Yeah.  It took me a while to convince him to do it.  But because my parents, usually on Fridays, my dad doesn't work. 
[00:41:00]  We sat across the street and waited for them to leave.  They usually go grocery shopping afterwards.  So why are you whispering if they're not in the house?  I don't know.  I guess because I'm all freaked out on doing that.  See, we're not...  I don't know if we're buying your story.  I know.  It gets bigger and bigger and worse and worse as it goes along.  And, you know, it's so outrageous that, you know, it leads us to believe that perhaps  it isn't really happening.  Let us talk to him. 
[00:41:30]  Hold on.  Yeah.  We do have a cast, though.  Hey.  Yeah.  Who are you?  Fred.  What?  Fred.  Fred?  Fred.  And you're the friend of the father.  Uh-huh.  And you've been having sex with this daughter.  Yeah.  What did the father do when he found out?  He'd shit out of me.  And how old are you?  38.  38.  And you're banging your best friend's daughter. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  And her father's 38?  I think he's pushing 40.  Uh-huh.  And, um, man, I just don't know if I'd buy this.  It's so outrageous that it's like, you want to believe it because it's so outrageous,  but then you kind of got to think, how can this possibly really be happening?  Hey, Fred, if she gives you a Hummer, will you promise not the sheets?  Will you arc one on the pillow?  I don't even know if I can get it off or not. 
[00:42:30]  Oh, you don't even know you can get it off?  I can get it off.  Oh, get it off.  Now, um, wow, what to ask this guy?  How big is it?  What?  So you've been taking her to the hotel, huh?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And giving her, is she hot?  Yes, she's hot.  Yeah.  So you've been looking at her for many years?  Uh, I think she's about 16, I guess.  16?  Yeah.  Cool.  And how bad did he get beat up the other day?  I got a black eye, fat lip.  What did he do?  Like, how did he, all of a sudden, you don't know what's happening, and you see the father, 
[00:43:00]  what, pull up?  Yeah, I didn't really think anything about it, and then he just busted in the door and  started beating the shit out of me.  So he came to your house, did he say anything?  Uh, just shit like, you know, what the hell you doing with my daughter, and stuff like that.  And what did you say?  I just kind of crouched on the couch, and tried to cover up the best I could.  And took it like a man, knowing what you were going to get later on that night from his  daughter, right?  Yeah.  So you like that hot piece of ass in front of you? 
[00:43:30]  Oh, yeah.  A whole lot better than my wife.  Oh, yeah, your wife.  What happened to her?  She hasn't come home yet.  Where was she?  She's in St. Petersburg.  Man, everything, like, adds up.  They got the story together.  It's so cool.  They all had their story together.  It's like a little drama club.  This is definitely, I, Anthony and I have talked about this, uh, this thing that's been  going on on our show for the last few days, and we're, we're, we're just not sure what's  real and what's not.  Because it's so out there.  It, it's one of those things. 
[00:44:00]  I mean, everyone's facts are kind of lining up.  They're really prepared if it isn't.  Yes, Sex Bagel.  Ask him, um, the hotel they were talking about last time, is it the one down the street or the  one near the mall?  Yeah.  What, uh, what hotel was it at?  Was it the one down the street or the one near the mall?  It was the one up next to the mall.  Yeah, that's right.  The one next to the mall.  Would you, would you guys be able to come in studio someday?  I don't want to see these two.  I can't wait to see these two.  They're the greatest two ever.  I, I, all right, well, so, uh, are you naked? 
[00:44:30]  Is she naked?  Yeah, she is, but I just got my pants down.  I'm, I, I don't want to take my pants off or anything.  I'm going to get out of here if anything happens.  So, why would you be talked into this?  I'm stupid.  Well, I'll give you that.  And, uh, and why is, it's Ashley, right?  Why is Ashley, um, so upset with her parents that she would do this?  I don't know.  You don't know?  She never talks to you about it?  Nah, she's, same old teenage stuff, you know how they are. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Of course we do.  Hell yeah.  Tight as a drum.  Um, so what is Ashley doing now?  She's, she's working on it.  She's working on your thing?  Uh-huh.  And, uh, is, what does she look like?  She, I don't know, long, long, long brown hair.  Mm-hmm.  Blue eyes.  Mm-hmm.  About five, about five, two.  Mm-hmm.  Uh, about 110 pounds, I guess.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh, caught him.  What was that?  She said 108. 
[00:45:30]  I heard a baby in the background.  Yeah, what am I hearing in the background, sir?  I believe TV.  TV's still playing.  All right, is she working you good?  Yeah.  Let's get the, let's get the phone to Ashley.  Hey, Ashley.  Hey.  So what are you doing?  I'm blowing them.  In your parents' bedroom?  Mm-hmm.  Oh, shit, there's your mom.  Okay.  All right, see, now I'm not buying it. 
[00:46:00]  All right, there it is.  They went too far.  Shit, there's your mom.  Oh, fuck!  Wait.  Okay.  Let's just listen.  Yeah.  Fuck off my bed.  Mom!  What the fuck is...  Those corn balls.  That was so bad.  Here's your mom.  And then he says again, here's your mom.  Here's your mom.  I don't think they heard it. 
[00:46:30]  There's your mom.  I think we put an end to that stuff, finally.  Mr. Faber-sham.  If you want me to be involved with the play, it's out of the question.  Out of the question.  Rachel, you sucked my cock and your mom walked in.  Your mom is back.  That was awful.  We wanted to believe it.  Yeah, but we...  Are you a sex bagel?  I just called the number back, the mom's phone number.  Yeah.  You just hear the phone come on.  You go, ow, my hair. 
[00:47:00]  You...  And then it hangs up again.  So they're still playing the act out.  They're still acting.  Like, we're going to keep calling them over and over to see if this...  The beautiful thing is, though, and I'll credit myself, I didn't buy this from the first...  From the get-go.  Yep.  Yep.  This is a bunch of bunk.  Bunk.  It was one of those things that sounded fun.  You wanted to believe it.  But they really, like, their little acting crew there, they had their facts lined up.  They were good.  I didn't think it was real, either.  It was one of those things, you know, it's kind of fun to listen to them making it up. 
[00:47:30]  And that was kind of funny, too.  Well, for a while there, we weren't sure.  Yeah, it was...  I was saying...  We've got to be honest.  And then we were...  And I were talking, we're like, I don't know, man.  I was saying there was a little element of doubt.  That was the only thread holding it together.  But after that, I mean, come on.  That ends it right there.  That ends it.  You know what really rubbed me the wrong way?  And I noticed this immediately, is that these two are supposedly fighting on the phone,  and yet they tolerated every idiotic thing we said.  Right, right.  The mother, you raised a slut.  Oh, a slut. 
[00:48:00]  I raised a slut, Mary.  Right now, what they're doing, they're all clasping hands and bowing.  They were.  Thank you.  Well, now they have to call back and tell us what that was all about.  Yeah, just call back.  We got the goof call back.  Yeah, we know you're kidding.  It was fun.  It was fun.  They put on a nice little show.  Absolutely.  It was like watching a miniseries.  It was a good three-day soap opera.  A vignette, yeah.  A vignette.  And you know what?  If you poll the audience, I think over 50% were buying this whole thing. 
[00:48:30]  Until today.  Yeah, that was just awful.  That was a huge discussion on a lot of the message boards.  You guys are tools.  Why are we tools?  Why are we tools, stupid asses?  Ever say donkey sausage.  Why are we tools?  We said just before we went to the phone call or continue with the phone call that we weren't  sure we were buying it completely.  Look at this guy.  Too bad Dad didn't show up.  Yeah, that would have been hot.  Him and Fred could have got into it.  Damn, you think they could have at least gotten into the BJ a little more? 
[00:49:00]  That didn't sound as fake.  Yeah.  Listener theater of the mind equals awful radio.  If no one thought it was real, how did you confirm that this was a real story yesterday?  Good point.  Good point.  Someone, I think, someone on this program did confirm it was a real story.  Someone did say they confirmed it and it's a real story.  And I think he's got frosted hair.  Was it Sex Bagel that was confirming that this was real? 
[00:49:30]  I think it was.  Well, we tried to confirm it by acting like a lawyer and stuff.  Yeah, but they weren't going to fess up to anybody.  I'll bet you they were saying, did you believe that idiot acted like a lawyer and he thinks  we bought it?  Oh, yes.  For legal ramifications.  We knew you weren't a real lawyer.  Anthony didn't know any real legal terms.  Look, technically there can be jail.  Jail?  Well, Sex Bagel's working on him.  Technicalically.  Sex Bagel, I think, is working on him right now.  Not only that, the name of the lawyer that I used was Chuck Schick, who was the lawyer  and the law student in Caddyshack that walked up, introduced you to, hey, I'd like you to 
[00:50:00]  meet Chuck Schick.  He's going to law school.  That's zero.  Chuck Schick.  That's good.  I'll say.  Mick Cage's performance in Windtalkers was better than that awful acting.  Yeah, that was horrendous.  Oh, it's your mom.  Nothing.  It's your mom.  Yeah, I know.  Just perfect timing.  It's your mom.  It's your mom.  When I give you the signal, we're going to yell, it's your mom. 
[00:50:30]  All right.  Oh, I got it.  Let's call up and we'll say that mom walked in.  You know, that's been bothering me for the last few days, so I'm glad there's an ending  to that.  But, guy, I tell you one thing.  The only thing he almost tripped up what color her hair was, blonde, brown.  Blonde brown.  Blonde brown.  She was probably shaking her hair in front of him.  No, I mean, she couldn't have been.  I bet you they wrote stuff down because you think the age is right, everything right.  The hotel location.  Everything. 
[00:51:00]  All right.  I think Ashley's back on the line here.  She's laughing.  Ashley.  Yeah.  All right.  You guys got to, like, fess up now because we're on to you.  Okay.  You remember.  You remember on your.  Look at them.  They're all little.  Look at this.  It's a comedy.  It's a comedy troupe.  It's the.  We're an improv group.  It's the Upright Citizens Brigade, everybody.  Do you remember.  Do you remember on your second show that the second week of your show on Monday, a girl  from Tennessee called and played with herself with that. 
[00:51:30]  With that high voltage vibrator.  Because I had dirty dreams about you.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, I'm Nina from Tennessee.  Oh, okay.  And you actually emailed me a couple times, right?  Yeah.  How about I drove to Hazleton so that Janice's number would register on your phone line?  Are you crazy?  No, what did you do?  Just forward it?  Yeah.  We just totally wanted to mess with you guys.  We were giving you a little bit of your positive women's promo.  You guys had.  Problem with the promo. 
[00:52:00]  All right.  All right.  Let's back up.  So you were the one from Tennessee that played with yourself, right?  Right.  So was that for real?  Yeah, that was for real.  So you had a real orgasm on our show?  Yes.  Okay.  All right.  So then you guys.  This is just totally because we just wanted to give you a little bit of women's positive  promo.  Yeah, that's positive.  All right.  All right.  So, Ashley, how old are you?  I told you.  I'm 32.  You're 32 and you're acting like a teenager?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And how about Janice, my mother?  Is 31.  Is 31. 
[00:52:30]  The mom.  Oh, I can't believe she's.  Hey, did you write stuff down?  No, I swear to God, we didn't write a nothing down.  Nothing down.  All improv.  Yeah, all improv.  Improv.  And we did it over the phone.  I was calling you guys from my Tennessee number.  She was.  And when you guys were calling her, it was from her Pennsylvania number.  Man.  And we were just communicating back and forth by phone.  And then Fred was actually my husband that you were talking to.  Yeah, Fred ruined it.  What does he do, true or false? 
[00:53:00]  Yeah, Fred's acting stunk.  They want to try and trap you, but they don't ever give you true or false.  I got to tell you, you know, there was a point I was believing it for a while.  I think there was a point Anthony was for a little bit.  I'm always completely skeptical, so there was that element of doubt the whole time,  and I'm always fishing around trying to find out.  I wanted to believe it.  Oh, hell yeah.  And then I got to tell you, the listeners, they're being honest on the instant feedback,  and it's split right down the middle, right?  It was always split 50-50.  Wow, we love your show, and the shit that you say about women isn't bad. 
[00:53:30]  I mean, hell.  I know.  Hey, what did you think of Anthony's lawyer impression?  I knew it was a crock of shit.  Of course you did.  Damn it.  Yeah, I played right into it.  Stupid Chuck Schick.  Yeah, Chuck ruined the program.  I'm going to give you to Janice.  She wants to talk to you for a couple minutes.  I love you guys.  Norton, you're a sweetheart, and I'll talk to you later.  Okay, thank you, miss.  Hello, this is Mom.  Hey, Janice, how are you?  Good, how are you?  You guys were pretty good, I got to tell you.  Were we? 
[00:54:00]  The first two days, we kind of wanted to go over the top today so that everybody really knew.  Yeah, there you go.  No, you're saying that now because it went horribly wrong.  The timing was awful.  Oh, well, we didn't, like we said, we didn't have anything planned.  But it was, you know, three days of fun, you know?  Yeah, well, we just figured, you know, maybe you can get something you could use for a positive promo.  That was great.  We enjoyed that.  As far as you're not having women listeners, you obviously know you do.  Well, can you guys make it up to us now and dyke out or something? 
[00:54:30]  Dyke out, Opie.  Or have Ashley get banged live on the show?  I think you've got to make it up to us now.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah, we'll have to do that.  All right.  You know what was a little confusing for me?  We played a Hi, Mom, I'm in Jail, our old CD.  Oh, no, that CD never came out.  That's right.  Well, it's out there, though, and thousands of people are enjoying it, thanks to file sharing and OA virus.  Dot com.  But then she, you know, Ashley called up, decided this is my opportunity and said, I want to do one of those. 
[00:55:00]  And that's when I was like, well, if it was something planned, you know, the timing, you know what I mean?  I know.  Yeah, yeah.  The timing was too good.  Yeah, well, we tried to make it sound a little more real, but, you know, we're not professional, so.  You guys at least made it seem professional.  That Fred, that's the worst acting I've ever heard.  I know.  Fred was horrible.  Yeah, we hated Fred.  Fred, he made Voss seem like John Gielgud.  Wow, nice.  Good reference.  All right, guys. 
[00:55:30]  Okay, but we love you, and we're going to continue listening to you.  We think you guys rock.  Thank you.  Stay away from the pranks, or people are going to start thinking we're doing fake radio.  Okay, no, no, no, no.  And tell Ashley she's got a bang now, live on the show.  Okay, we will.  All right.  There it is.  Oh, you're going to get it.  Hey, dude, let me tell you, these chicks were real.  Hey, it's Rockhole.  What's going on?  Me and Dave are calling these chicks again. 
[00:56:00]  Hell, all right.  That was fun.  Fessed up to it.  Cool.  It was fun to listen to for a little while.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of The Worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Travis.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Travis.  Holy mackerel am I enjoying that radio program.  I know what boys like.  I know what guys want.  Okay.  I know what boys like. 
[00:56:30]  Thank you.  You're listening to The Worst of Opie and Anthony?  This is Travis's Picks with Than and Sam from The Opie and Anthony and Than and Sam Show.  Big Kev smells.  I've heard.  It's the next bit.  Oh, I was going to.  Oh, that's the next bit.  My bad.  Yeah, that's not just me talking.  We're just hanging out talking about what we don't like about different people.  Okay, that's personal.  This was a very uncomfortable phoner with Big Kev.  For who?  For, I believe, Anthony. 
[00:57:00]  Oh.  I believe Anthony was uncomfortable.  The rest of us were giddy.  Yes.  And I believe jumping up and down.  Not me.  I've been a Big Kev fan since day one.  No, I don't think that's true.  Well, judge for yourself.  Should we give him a plug?  No.  Yeah.  Of course.  If you want to check out his show, go to BigKevsGreekStuff.com to get everything you  want to know about Big Kev and his show.  Or, if you want to go shopping.  Yep.  If it's the holiday season and you didn't get anything you wanted for Christmas, go to BigKevsToyStore.com.  Excellent website.  That's where I get all my toys.  I got my Jack Bauer figures from there.  Nice.  Check out Big Kev's smells on The Worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[00:57:30]  Did you not see where I was going there?  Or did you just not want to give him a plug?  I just didn't want to give him a plug.  The Worst of Opie and Anthony.  It has to be addressed.  What?  I don't want to.  Believe me.  It's painful for me to have to address this.  But it's got to be addressed.  It does.  Because, you know, it happens too often.  Yeah.  And it's just, it's one of those things that has to be addressed. 
[00:58:00]  What happened?  Look.  We all like Big Kev.  Right?  We all like Big Kev.  You're going there?  I have to.  Holy shit.  Dude.  Dude.  I have to.  You're blowing up his spot?  It's not a spot to blow up.  Holy shit.  Everyone is freaking out.  Everyone's freaking out.  Holy crap.  It's not a secret.  Except to him.  This is going to solve a problem.  I'll be honest.  I'm relieved.  Because when you said we have to address something, I'm sitting there like big saucer eyes like, 
[00:58:30]  uh-oh.  Yeah.  He's going to call me out on something.  I thought I was getting booted from the trees.  Yeah, exactly.  I'm like.  No, no, no.  We're all, yeah.  Jimmy and I are looking around, you know, we're feeling kind of confident, but not really.  And then, all right, go ahead.  It's because it's all whispering and everything's going around and stuff like that.  And it's just got to be brought out.  All right.  Kev has no sense of smell.  None.  That's what it is.  He doesn't.  It's a medical thing.  He's talked about it on the air a few times.  Which means he has no sense of taste, by the way. 
[00:59:00]  Which means how do you eat so many cupcakes when you can't taste them?  Well, I thought.  Why not just mash up carrots and eat them?  I thought that explained what he wears every day.  He had the surgery and he has lost a lot of weight.  Yes, he has.  For the new listeners, you've got to explain that.  I was talking to Kev before the show today.  He was close to 600 pounds when we first met him.  Yep.  He's now down to 320.  Giant.  I believe.  Giant.  And he's getting two operations to get the excess skin removed, which I think is part of what  you're going to bring up.  This may be part of an issue that's going on. 
[00:59:30]  So since he has no sense of smell, he's not able to really get a sense of what he is emitting  at certain times.  And there are certain days he comes in here, today being one of them, that it's not that  pleasurable to be in his company as far as my sense of smell goes. 
[01:00:00]  Yes, cranky ass.  Your olfactory senses.  My olfactory.  And mine.  Yes, it is what is called cranky ass sometimes.  You just get a little sweaty.  You get a little thing.  Hey, we've all had our times.  I know sometimes I sit in here and I'm sweating and I know perhaps I, you know, should maybe,  you know, a little B.O.  A little B.O.  Yeah, yeah.  You're like getting hot.  Sometimes it's 110 degrees in this fucking studio.  A little B.O.  never hurt anyone.  And I'll plaster my arms down, run for my coat and get the fuck out of here as quickly 
[01:00:30]  as possible.  Why would you care?  If I had, believe me, if my pits stink, I'm fucking raising my arms and walking by every  one of you creeps.  Who cares?  Not only raising your arms, you would get the fan out.  Yeah, I would just fucking flop a little like I was doing the bird.  And with all due respect and with all due friendship.  And I'm so uncomfortable with it that that's the reason.  If anyone ever asks, well, why don't you just say it off the air or something?  Because I'm too uncomfortable to face somebody and say it off the air.  I'm a big pussy. 
[01:01:00]  Now he's hearing this during the replay.  It'll get back to him.  He's going to hear this during the replay.  It'll get back to him.  Why don't you just say what you've got to say?  Because you don't want to say it privately.  I think I did.  You're always better off doing it in front of the entire country.  I think I just did.  That's a hell of a friend, I've got to tell you.  I think I just did.  I just did.  I just, you know, that was it.  I understand.  And when you look in the fucking monkey cage over there that our producers and various  staff are in, the second I even mentioned it, their heads were bobbing up and down.  The fucking bobblehead dolls in there. 
[01:01:30]  Mentioned what?  Uh, Kev?  Yes?  Hi, Kev.  Hi.  Hi.  Is there a problem?  There was an issue two times ago when you came in.  And then this time today.  Okay.  There is sort of a, um, now I know you have no sense of smell, right?  That's true.  That's why you're on the bus today.  Uh-huh.  Because you're one of those that doesn't have to really deal with the homeless people.  Sitting next to Tom eating egg salad. 
[01:02:00]  And it doesn't matter to him.  Right.  It doesn't matter to him.  But, um, there's been, there's been, uh, there's been talk around the studio.  Okay.  And we just want to bring it to your attention so that the problem can be solved and everything.  Mind you, this will do friendship, all do respect.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Mind you, it wasn't talk amongst all of us.  It was one person talking.  No, it wasn't.  There has been.  So basically Anthony said what?  Anthony, I, Anthony for once brought this, to everyone's attention. 
[01:02:30]  I pretty much stayed out of it.  Okay.  Look, you stayed out of it, but it's, there's just, oh my God.  Why?  Yes, Anthony.  I, I, I, you know, you know, you're my friend, Kev.  Oh, okay.  And, uh, normally I guess this would be a face-to-face thing, but I am really too much of a pussy to actually, uh, come out and face-to-face, uh, say something. 
[01:03:00]  Okay.  But there, there is kind of a, a fragrance, I guess.  Uh-huh.  That was coming off of you.  That was a little, well, Jimmy, uh, help me out here.  He stinks and I don't like him.  No, that isn't true.  That is interesting.  Okay.  Yeah, I, I just wanted you to know.  Um, there, there, if, if that's true, I apologize.  It smells like, it smells like, I love to smell like, come in the morning. 
[01:03:30]  Yes?  I assure you there's a, uh, there's an explanation.  Oh, okay.  Well, uh, that doesn't have to be something public.  No.  All right.  Okay, okay.  All right.  So I, I apologize.  Uh, uh, are you sure?  It was, uh, it was me and not anyone else.  See, see, look at these motherfuckers over there nodding their heads.  Uh, there's five people nodding their heads in the other room.  And Bill is throwing his shoulders up like he didn't know. 
[01:04:00]  It was a little rough to narrow it down with a lot of the homeless in here today.  Okay.  But, um, but, uh.  Well, thank you for bringing it to my attention.  I would, and like I said, if I wasn't such a pussy, I, uh, I would have, uh, said something  in, in private, but it's not like these little co-conspirators that are sitting there fucking  saying shit.  Well, it's really easy for everybody else just to kind of sit back and not say anything  while letting you do the heavy lifting.  Jimmy.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Right.  Well, I, I assure you there's a, there's an explanation. 
[01:04:30]  Well, we had speculated.  Low water pressure.  And, uh.  And it has to do with a, an upcoming surgery.  Yes, it does.  Yeah, okay.  There's some, there's some preparations that are happening and, uh.  Yeah.  That, that may be involved.  That's what was speculating.  And we only.  Although I can't, I can't identify it exactly because I, like you said, I, I have no way of  telling myself.  That's a tough fucking nut.  No sense of smell.  Yes.  Eh, it's rough.  All right, there it is.  There it is.  Well.  Problem solved, people. 
[01:05:00]  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  I, I apologize.  All right.  No need.  All right, big cap.  Take care.  Bye.  Oh, Jesus, Anthony.  Well, I, you know, I needed to clear the air.  I just wish I had, I wish I had more balls instead of just sitting here nodding quietly.  Now, let me also bring up the fact that is why Jimmy was fucking miserable when he walked  in.  Oh, really?  Did you see Jimmy's face when he walked in?  Yeah.  He was fucking miserable.  He comes in like, oh, Jesus Christ.  Oh, and then he keeps looking over and looking at me and going, ah, Jesus.  God, God, fuck. 
[01:05:30]  God.  No, it was a transit strike.  I was so mad.  Shut up.  There are people walking to work today and that bothers me.  Hey, this is Big Kev and you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst, the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Travis.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  What do you got?  I got Intern Ricky.  Ooh.  Remember Intern Ricky?  I do.  Sam did not know Intern Ricky.  But I knew him through the radio waves. 
[01:06:00]  You knew him through the radio program.  Yes.  Intern Ricky was probably one of our best interns.  I would agree.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Okay.  In terms of the radio he gave.  Sure.  And his tasks.  Towards the end of his internship, he was asked to write a book report, I believe, on sarcasm.  Yes.  We probably explained why he had to do it within the context of this bit.  If Eric cut it up correctly, then yes, we did.  Hopefully.  Yes.  I had to give him a little lesson and then, yeah, Opie and Anthony picked up on it and here you go. 
[01:06:30]  This is one of my favorite bits.  That's perfect because that's what we're supposed to be playing.  Because Ricky made me look real good.  Oh, well.  We're in the same intern class.  Let's find out why he made you look so good.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Travis's picks.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Are you ready for your book report?  Or whatever the year was?  It was kind of a, yeah, report.  A report?  On sarcasm?  Yeah.  Where is it?  It's in my back pocket, actually. 
[01:07:00]  It's like at school.  Yeah, we asked him to do a...  Fold it up in your back pocket.  What school do you go to?  Westchester Community College.  Westchester.  Rich, we told him to do a little report on sarcasm.  He didn't get sarcasm.  Yeah.  Nathaniel was in our office one day.  Who, by the way, really gets sarcasm.  He gets sarcasm the most out of the interns.  Yeah.  The most.  He was sitting at his desk.  And for some reason, there were a bunch of the chairs in the office were all gathered  around him. 
[01:07:30]  People had just pushed him there, I guess.  And he looked around and went, could I get another chair around me?  And Ricky grabbed another, the couch.  Yeah.  And was trying to push the couch over there, thinking, perhaps you really did need to get  another seat around him.  Yeah.  So he could have...  Oh, that's right.  Jimmy wasn't here for that, either.  Complete lack of understanding about sarcasm.  Look at Jimmy.  Oh, yeah, Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jimmy's holding it in his head.  Yeah, Nathaniel's just like, could I have another chair around me?  And he went to get him another chair.  Yeah.  You're a real ass. 
[01:08:00]  You are a real ass.  So we told him if he's going to work on this show, he really has to understand sarcasm.  Absolutely.  So we told him to do a little report on sarcasm.  I mean, you're a bright guy.  No.  He looks like ADD.  If you could look at ADD, he's just in another game.  The face of ADD.  Is that it?  Yeah.  Dude, why don't you have any confidence in yourself?  Did parents beat you up when you were growing up?  No, no. 
[01:08:30]  Not physically, but just...  Mentally, you mean?  Yeah, something.  Yeah, something.  Yeah.  Yeah.  They wouldn't let you sleep in the hut as a kid back in El Salvador?  No, I never lived there.  I was born here, so, thankfully.  But they both came from there, so...  Both.  Why is that painful, that you were born here?  No, no.  Did you say painfully?  No, thankfully.  Oh, thankfully.  Okay, I'm sorry.  You kind of get a little ghetto every so often, I've noticed.  You try to get a little ghetto, like your voice.  Yeah.  When you're not hanging out with us, with Caucasian people, is there a... 
[01:09:00]  Do you really, like, get into the whole ghetto thing?  I guess so.  Yeah.  I see.  So I can say both and stuff instead of both.  That's right.  I see you get him some pussy, and then right when he's finished, have Nurse Ratchett come in.  We got...  Yell at him?  Yeah.  I don't want to have to tell your mother, Ricky.  Please don't shave my mustache. 
[01:09:30]  And we give Ricky a lot of credit.  He's in college, and he does his own radio show.  Are these new clips from your radio show?  I suppose so, yeah.  Yeah?  Okay.  Want to listen to more of Ricky's college radio show, Anthony?  Jimmy?  Oh, absolutely.  Horse.  W-Y-U-K.  W-Y-U-K.  W-Y-U-K.  Uh-huh.  Sure.  Anyway.  Yeah.  Anyway.  What?  What did you...  Anyway, look.  I'm getting stuff today for... 
[01:10:00]  Yeah, they're whispering over there, which...  Anyway.  Anyway, I'm getting...  We're going to change the subject to, um...  Anyway, my clothing.  Ricky's shoes.  No, not even much.  Well, okay.  I'm coming in today just because I have a job interview.  He looks so nice.  Pretty boy.  He is so beautiful.  I'm getting stuff just because I have...  Pretty boy.  Pretty.  He got the pretty hair with the pretty shoe.  The pretty...  His braces are pretty.  He got everything pretty.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  But real quick, it's just I'm getting crap for it just because, um...  I'm wearing chakras.  Just because I can't stand... 
[01:10:30]  Adidas.  Let them know.  Yeah, because I can't...  Adidas.  I can't wear dress shoes all day.  Come on.  It's like, I'm just wearing sneakers, whatever.  Wearing dresses is like...  Try being a girl.  Ricky, that is captivating.  Wow.  Yeah, I know.  It stinks.  You can tell that whole crew is like the nerdiest.  He's got like the black...  The biggest Uncle Tom probably on campus there.  You know?  Makes Kid Africa look like Malcolm X.  You know?  And some broad...  Three nerds.  Wow.  That shot's my man, Bush Rocker, right there. 
[01:11:00]  He got a special delivery.  G-Dev.  That was the remix.  And then I got some Wu-Tang coming up right now.  Old school Wu-Tang.  Protect your neck on the new sound of FI-88.  Yeah, he was ghetto right there.  Yeah.  That was your ghetto delivery.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's good.  You put on a good, um...  What do they call that?  Uh, uneducated sound.  Yeah.  I wanna lead a game without at least saying goodbye.  So all my people on the left, all my people on the right, swing me. 
[01:11:30]  One last time.  It's the new sound of FI-88, it's Ricky here.  I don't need any music for the, uh, outro today.  It's 11.58.  Got two minutes after my show, but it's basically the end anyway.  I was gonna wait for Abby, just so she can, uh, plug her show, but I'll do it for her.  She's coming on from, uh, 2 to 4 today.  Uh, tune in to her.  She does some great, uh, stuff.  She does some great talk-ups.  She does, uh, she talks a lot about, uh, things.  And then she also, um, plays a lot of good music.  So tune in to her, 2 to 4 today. 
[01:12:00]  914-606-6753.  I've got the Power Hour coming up next.  And, uh, that's about it for today.  See ya.  I like how you started singing with the song.  Is that an Eminem song you were singing to?  Yeah, that was the end of, uh, Encore.  And I can't believe I even freaking did that.  Good time.  That was good.  Yeah, it was pretty amazing.  You listen to that show, remember the scene when people were jumping out of the windows  during the Depression?  That was really, um, horrible.  Really, really bad.  Yeah. 
[01:12:30]  What's next?  Yeah.  Well, we got the report on sarcasm, I guess.  God.  Here's the report on sarcasm.  You play that radio show and someone says, that was good.  That's the end of the report.  And it basically sums it up.  God, this guy has no self-esteem whatsoever.  I know, and we're just a ship on the way.  And justifiably so, I feel bad for him.  Did you ever work, like, for a guy named Perenal or something?  You seem, like, beaten down.  Hey, Mark Perenal.  All right, why don't we get his report in, Anthony? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah, let's get this done.  All right, let's get this over.  Let's hear, by the way, Ricky's take on sarcasm.  This will be your last appearance on our show.  So make it good.  Go out in a blaze of glory.  Please.  All right.  All right.  Let her rip.  Make believe, you know, you're in a classroom and you actually have to do an oral report  on sarcasm.  That actually makes it worse, though.  But okay.  You want to be radio, so you got to...  Yeah, I mean, this should be no big deal.  You okay there, Ricky?  You look like you're freaking out.  Oh, hell yeah, man.  I'm freaking nervous right now.  Why?  I don't know.  You're good.  Now he's saying freaking. 
[01:13:30]  Yeah, because I...  A little potty mouth.  Mom might have heard that.  Yeah.  She doesn't know how to operate an XM radio thing, so...  I'm good to see him.  I'm stupid.  All right, that's nice.  She's castrating and stupid.  Very nice, Rick.  Well, at least we know where you got your stupid part from.  I think he's a good kid.  You know what?  Shut your diplomatic face.  I like the kid.  I think he's a good...  It's hard to smash him.  It really is.  I like him a lot.  I really think for 19...  You know what?  We're going to go back to my place and talk about your career tonight.  Ooh.  Two men getting scented marmalade. 
[01:14:00]  We only have a minute left?  No.  Three.  Oh, three.  Okay.  Come on.  Let her rip.  Oh, let her rip.  Sarcasm.  I just wanted to start out this little presentation on the definition on sarcasm, which has two  meanings.  One, a cutting, often ironic remark intended to wound.  Second, a definition of it, a form of wit that is marked by the use of sarcastic language  and is intended to make its victim the butt of contempt or ridicule.  Hey, this is good. 
[01:14:30]  Yeah.  Like when someone says that's proper to say the T in often.  That dumps.  What does it mean to you, though?  You just copy and paste it from a dictionary.  Well, he said to start, he wants to give the definition and then he'll move on.  Plagiarizing just bucket.  Go ahead.  I just did this a couple of hours ago when I was drunk, so it didn't really help out  too much.  That's great.  Way to impress Anthony and I and Jimmy.  Yeah.  Jesus.  We'll give you an assignment and you'll do it last minute.  Sorry.  Go ahead.  Everyone is sarcastic in one way or another just to be funny or just to mess around with 
[01:15:00]  another person.  It all depends on the situation and how it's supposed to be used.  Yeah.  Is this your words?  Yeah.  Okay.  That's fine.  It sucks.  That's good.  $50,000 isn't anything is one example of sarcasm.  There are some times when sarcasm is used, but you can't really tell.  Wait, wait, wait.  $50,000 isn't an opi line that made sense.  Yeah, but explain that.  Why is that?  Yeah, I keep going with it. 
[01:15:30]  The example I said before about opi saying to Jim that $50,000 isn't really anything was  an obvious sarcasm, but there were people that thought that him saying that without a second  thought may not...  You can curse at settling.  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, you might as well curse.  You need a drink?  No, no, no.  To loosen you up a little bit?  No.  No.  All right, back up a little bit because you were stuttering through that whole last line.  Yeah.  I'm just noticing some typos and stuff, so... 
[01:16:00]  Why are you shaking?  Look at...  You're shaking.  Put your hand out.  Just calm down.  Put your hand out straight in front of you like this.  Wow.  Yeah, you're shaking.  It's not like you're on a really popular radio show that the whole country's listening to.  Relax.  Just relax.  There's only four or five people in the room.  Just picture it that way.  Holy crap, dude.  Relax.  People looking from out there, the whole film crew.  Yeah, the film crew, they don't even care.  They're just trying to get the lights right.  Just calm down a little bit. 
[01:16:30]  Yeah.  I don't know if I really forgot where I was already.  Your hero, Travis.  Come on now.  Snap to it.  Get to this.  Are you...  Oh my God, they turned the lights off.  They're turning the lights off.  Yeah, here comes the Sandman.  No, go ahead.  You can do it, man.  Focus.  Focus.  Come on.  Look in Jimmy's eyes.  Go ahead.  I'm supporting him.  Look, see?  Look in his eyes.  He'll show you the support that you need right now.  Wow.  All right, we're going to have to do this tomorrow. 
[01:17:00]  Are you in tomorrow?  No, I'm in Friday.  All right, we'll have to do it Friday because I think the show's ending, like, right.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Travis.  Travis.  Make it like it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The virus is an XL channel which may contain explicit language.  Channel blocking is available by calling 1-800-XM-RADIO or in XM-Canada, 877-438-9677.  The virus.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:17:30]  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Travis.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I am Travis, and I am joined by Than and Sam.  Don't do that into the mic.  That's too loud. 
[01:18:00]  That was way too loud.  It really hurt my ears.  I was coughing quietly.  That's why you're not supposed to do that into the mic, I guess.  Yeah.  Lesson learned.  So, when we were picking these bits, and it finally got around to me, most of the Master  Poe bits were taken.  Surprisingly.  What happened there?  I don't know.  So, I'm kind of getting the bottom of the barrel of the Master Poe bits.  As long as they're all played in some form.  I think they will be.  We need to empty the barrel before the end of the week.  Master Poe had a hurricane evacuation plan. 
[01:18:30]  Oh, of course.  In place in case a hurricane were to hit New York City, and for some reason we didn't have  ample time to get out of the studio.  And here, Steve discusses the hurricane evacuation plan with Master Poe in all of his retarded  glory.  It's an enjoyable bit.  It certainly is.  And it's on the worst of Opie and Anthony, Travis Edition.  The worst.  It's the worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show. 
[01:19:00]  We've got to get Martini Steve back in here, because he interviewed our own Master Poe.  Oh, right.  This is hurricane-related, isn't it?  Yes.  Yes.  I guess Master Poe was watching some of the coverage and saw that this evacuation was a  disaster.  And a lot of people died.  And being in charge of people's lives here at the studio, our lives are in Poe's hands  at some points.  Do you know that?  Yeah, I do.  And if, God forbid, a disaster like Karina swept across Manhattan, what would we do? 
[01:19:30]  What would we do?  He's not the brightest guy, I've got to tell you.  Jeez, Opie.  He just isn't.  The other day, after the show, I had a meet with Barry Shapiro, my Jewish, basically, business  accountant guy.  I don't even know what he does for us.  I guess he's his finance guy.  Our finance guy.  He figures out a way to funnel our money.  Typical Jew, no hair.  Jesus, Opie.  Typical Jewish guy, no hair. 
[01:20:00]  Jeez.  A punch.  Like, this guy couldn't hurt anyone.  Sucked in gym class.  He was the last guy chosen when he was picking some eyes.  Accountant.  Dude, next time I have a meeting with him, I'm going to record it because I swear to you,  it's another language that we don't know about yet.  Yeah.  When he talks about stuff, I'm like, this is going on somewhere out there?  There's all kinds of financial things that he tells us about.  He knows the latest laws and rules and it's unbelievable. 
[01:20:30]  So he bored me to death for at least 45 minutes.  It is boring as hell, I'll give you that.  I dread his meeting.  And I'm leaving with Barry and as a joke, I walk by Master Poe and I go, watch out for  this guy.  He throws a mean punch.  Obviously, this guy doesn't even have a hint of muscle on him, okay?  He's like a veal.  Can't lift his arm above his shoulder.  He's a veal with a calculator.  He stinks. 
[01:21:00]  So the next day, I skate up to Master Poe, who, you know, makes sure we're safe.  And Master Poe goes to me, hey, that guy yesterday, he throws a mean punch, huh?  Like, Master Poe, it's, what?  I couldn't believe you were buying that I was serious.  You're the best, oh, now, nothing's going to ever keep you down.  I go, who?  I go, who?  And he goes, the guy you were walking out with yesterday after the show. 
[01:21:30]  I'm like, Master Poe, it's Barry Shapiro.  He doesn't know how to punch or do anything.  How did you buy that?  Well, I don't know his background.  When you told me he throws a mean punch, you really can't underestimate anyone.  Anyone?  That's right.  Even Barry Shapiro?  Barry Shapiro.  He could be 90 pounds and knock someone out.  Wow.  There was a skinny guy that fought, I don't remember his name, but he fought Muhammad Ali,  and he knocked Muhammad Ali down.  But he was in the fight game to begin with. 
[01:22:00]  Well, yeah.  Bow to your sensei.  Bow to your sensei!  Barry Shapiro ain't hurting anyone.  No, it's the martial art mindset.  Right.  Anyone's a threat.  Anybody can be a threat.  Anyone's a threat, and he assesses everybody.  But see, if you have that attitude, you'll never get to sleep at night.  This guy, obviously, is not going to be a problem.  Who says Poe sleeps at night?  See him just sitting there.  I'm just going to figure out what the threat level is at any given moment.  Some people you can just look at and realize there's going to be no problem there. 
[01:22:30]  Well, sure.  Let's be honest.  I mean, Barry Shapiro is not...  How old is the guy?  50-something.  Dude, the guy hasn't done a...  I don't think he's ever done a sit-up.  I don't think...  There was a 50-year-old accountant who knocked out Joe Frazier.  You don't want to underestimate a 50-year-old, out-of-shape Jewish accountant.  Yeah, I'm with you, Paul.  It's on classic sports.  Well, he could have trained for 10 years before that.  Who knows?  Or when he was a kid.  You know what it would be like?  It would be like saying that... 
[01:23:00]  Remember the time to make the donuts guy from Dunkin' Donuts?  That's pretty much what this guy's threat level is, if you just look at him.  He kind of...  It's like that.  You wouldn't think the time to make the donuts guy would be any type of threat.  Okay, well, Bernie gets.  He's skinny.  As a matter of fact, he's probably skinnier than this guy.  Well, someone skinny is a different story, maybe.  But this guy isn't skinny.  Yeah, that was all about...  Yeah.  Yeah.  He had a gun.  Right.  True.  I was talking about Barry physically hurting somebody with a punch. 
[01:23:30]  I said he packs a mean punch.  Right.  Poe just sees it as, all right, I'm going to take the world differently.  Every martial artist out there will not underestimate their opponent.  There you go.  Free the cricket from whackbag.com.  Poe equals literal idiot.  Jesus.  Very brave through the internet.  So, Martini Steve is in the studio.  And you interviewed Master Poe.  Well, yeah, we were talking about the potential for a hurricane to actually hit Manhattan. 
[01:24:00]  And I wanted to know what the evacuation plan would be if, God forbid, a hurricane hit while we were all in the building.  Uh-huh.  So, we're up here quite a few feet off street level.  Right.  Also, by the way, we are on the highest point in Manhattan.  This is, you know, right where we are.  Right. 
[01:24:30]  It's downhill anywhere you go.  It's like, east side, west side, you're going downhill.  Right.  Uh, I don't think we'd get the type of flooding here that we saw in New Orleans, which is below sea level.  Well, you have to be prepared.  And I just really wanted to hear what the plan might be.  Why is Master Poe giving you a look right now?  I don't know.  What's wrong, Master Poe?  Well, because we were having a discussion and he was just asking me his advice because he said his wife was nervous.  Didn't know that he was being recorded.  So, you were recording me. 
[01:25:00]  I certainly was.  Oh, yeah.  This was, yeah, Master Poe had no idea we were going to.  It was a scandal.  He didn't have an idea that we were taping this for the radio.  Take a look at what I'm wearing, people.  You think anybody wants a roundhouse kick to the face while I'm wearing these bad boys?  Who was it, Linda Tripp?  So, it's not exactly the most, the easiest interview to conduct considering the fact that, you know,  I know full well that this place is well above sea level and I'm not an idiot. 
[01:25:30]  We're five floors up.  Yeah.  Well, but Master Poe takes everything seriously.  Right, and you said that you wanted to leave.  You're talking evacuation.  Now, how would we evacuate?  I think the safest place would be just to stay put here.  Right.  We'd probably stay on the air and just have a little fun.  That's right.  If there was a hurricane and we couldn't leave, I think...  Well, what happens if the power goes out?  Oh, right now the power goes out.  Right.  Auxiliary power kicks on, we're back on the air.  Do we have auxiliary power?  Of course we do.  Everyone does in New York.  Have you ever been in a completely blackout building? 
[01:26:00]  Certainly have.  I was stuck at...  You were stuck at where?  At NEW, the last blackout, and there's no auxiliary power there, so that sucks.  Were you always stuck in the elevator?  No, fortunately.  Stuck in the staircase?  So you could just walk down.  And we did.  We did, but you're walking down...  How many flights down was that?  Nine?  I don't know.  You have to follow Earl's eyes and see.  Whole nine stories to get to freedom.  Oh, no, I'm not, you know, but he asked.  Smile, Earl.  There's no generators.  Light the way.  All right, well, so Steve interviewed Master Poe, and we got some audio. 
[01:26:30]  Master Poe had no idea we were interviewing him.  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation plan.  I'm sorry?  What?  No, I mean, there's apparently a...  I guess there's actually...  Steve, you're the biggest pussy.  What?  I can hear that you're nervous.  No, I'm trying not to crack up.  Are you sure?  Yeah.  I'm not afraid of what Poe's going to do if he happens to get angry and, you know,  knock my head off.  You kind of have a nervousness to your voice, like, oh, God, I hope I don't piss him off.  No, no, no.  It's, oh, God, I hope I don't crack up.  All right, all right. 
[01:27:00]  There's apparently a...  I guess there's a...  Because he's, like, slamming things around, like, oh, yeah.  I hope this goes okay.  He can never infiltrate the mob.  Right.  He'd find the wire in, like, two seconds.  Yeah, exactly.  He'd be a little nervous.  From his voice, you could tell something's up already.  He's slamming it, right.  He's like...  He's like...  I am...  I am...  Trying to...  Desperately...  The sweat pouring off the floor.  Desperately trying to maintain my composure while asking questions without bursting into 
[01:27:30]  fucking laughter.  You all right, Steve?  No, I'm not wearing a wire.  It just loses it immediately.  I'm just a little wired.  I mean...  You're right.  Listen to how natural Steve comes across.  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation plan.  I'm sorry?  What?  No, I mean...  It sounds like...  What?  No.  Uh-huh.  It sounds like it's written like bad acting.  Like, they're reading a script.  Apparently I'm supposed to...  Uh-huh.  I'm sorry?  Uh-huh.  I'm sorry?  No. 
[01:28:00]  Thank you.  Apparently I'm supposed to get with you about an evacuation plan.  I'm sorry?  What?  No, I mean, there's apparently a...  Uh-huh.  I guess there's actually now concern of this hurricane.  Are you kidding?  If...  Oh, fuck.  You're kidding me.  What are they saying?  If...  When is it hitting?  If in the event that it hits this area, what is the...  I guess... 
[01:28:30]  Uh...  I guess, what would your recommendation...  Holy shit!  Oh, that is not a guy that thinks he's gonna crack...  This is, uh...  I guess...  That's not a guy that's gonna crack up at any moment.  I'm trying to think how to phrase it.  Yeah, I'm really just trying to think how to phrase it, because I walked into this cold.  I'm not buying it.  What, you think I'm afraid?  You honestly think I'm frightened?  I think you're frightened.  I'm sorry.  Bill?  Frightened or is...  I don't know, it sounds like a bad soap opera acting.  I think he...  Yeah, that's what I think it is.  It's just bad acting.  Yeah, horrible acting.  And the fact that maybe he's a little shook up that this is being recorded. 
[01:29:00]  Right.  Yeah.  And he knows that his side is gonna be on this also, so he's gotta perform well.  I would agree with Anthony on that one.  I would totally fess up to bad acting and totally fess up to knowing it was being recorded.  Well, Poe, you've come back.  Rachel.  A string of peloponies.  It's awful acting.  It's really bad.  I guess, what would your recommendation be for an evacuation plan to get everybody out 
[01:29:30]  of here?  Okay.  First, we have to find out, when is it gonna hit?  I would assume.  And six hours before it hits?  Oh.  We're out of here.  Okay.  Not one hour before it hits.  Six hours before it hits.  Now, okay, why six hours? 
[01:30:00]  What would that time frame allow?  Well, I was involved with Hurricane Floyd, and I stayed-  You kicked his ass, right?  Yeah.  We stayed-  A truck kicked right to the eye.  Yeah, I care of that problem.  No, we stayed in the house, and we tried to fight this hurricane, and that was stupid.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So, the best thing for you to do is to get rid of your, or take your clothing, your electronics.  Well, we'll listen to the tape.  I just want to know why the six hours.  That's all.  Because six hours-  That'll give you time.  Also sounds kind of dangerous. 
[01:30:30]  Like, then you're out of the building on a crowded, evacuating road as the storm hits.  All right, let's listen.  I don't know.  Let's listen.  Who am I to say?  While he's sitting there coming.  Because if anybody has ever experienced being in a hurricane, it's one of the worst things  ever.  Now, you guys were up on top of this building, and if we stay here, most likely nothing's  going to happen.  However, depending on where we live, we may have to do some preparations in our homes. 
[01:31:00]  Okay.  Make some preparations.  I know I will definitely have to make some preparations.  All right.  So far, so good.  Fairly normal.  We'll move on here.  If by chance that we are hit by a hurricane, let's say now, and the best thing for us to  do is to stay here.  Stay here?  Well, it's too late.  The hurricane hit us.  If it's that bad-  Oh, I see what you're saying.  Because you know what's going to happen is you're getting, okay, you won't be able 
[01:31:30]  to get a taxi, you won't be able to get a train, and it'll be difficult for you to  get out of New York City.  Anthony will not, it's going to take him four and a half hours to get home.  So that's why we have to stay watch of this hurricane.  If by chance the hurricane is going to hit us, then we have to be ahead of it.  If the hurricane is going to hit us at two o'clock, then we have to get out of here  three, four hours, preferably ahead of time.  How much time for a slow-y cane, though? 
[01:32:00]  Because I would assume you've got more time.  No, that was wrong.  That was wrong.  If the hurricane is going to hit, just stay home.  Stay home.  Stay home.  We'd have enough advance notice.  So have you done any research on this shit, or he just came in and asked the question  and you just went with it?  No, I was hit by a hurricane.  I was hit by a hurricane very bad.  I lost my home in 99.  We got a comedian coming up this weekend.  This is my whole life.  And now the funny.  But when Steve asked you, it's pretty much cold. 
[01:32:30]  You didn't know that you were going into this meeting to discuss evacuation.  No, he said his wife was concerned.  Yeah.  All right, let's continue listening here.  Hurricane liver cirrhosis, maybe she'd be concerned.  Like, you know, say it's 7 o'clock in the morning and we get, you know, a heads up.  Guys, get out of Dodge.  Go now.  What do we do?  How do we get open at home?  How do we get?  What we should have outside, okay, Anthony is going to be driving home himself.  I would assume. 
[01:33:00]  I don't know.  Opie is probably going to need to be driven home.  He's not going to take a taxi or rollerblades.  I mean, if the hurricane is that bad, then we would take him home.  Well, look at that.  You got taken home.  Just let the hurricane blow me home.  I don't have to use my legs when I'm rollerblading.  You could put on your blades and the breeze would whisk you home.  Whisk me home.  Really nice and fast.  I guess the question is, let's, God forbid, if we're all stuck here for, let's say we're 
[01:33:30]  all stuck in this.  What we should do is have provisions.  We should have our flashlights.  We should have our food.  We should definitely have our water.  And we should have extra amount of that.  Now, honestly, if the hurricane is that bad, we can see it on television.  We say, okay, well, guess what, guys?  We shouldn't be here.  It's going to hit New York City this date. 
[01:34:00]  Do not be here because this is going to be a deadlock.  You won't be able to get in and out of the city.  9-11, same thing.  You couldn't get in and out of the city.  Right, right, right.  And the problem is that, okay, you have a hurricane, so now you have wind.  Is it a tropical storm?  The water's coming down so hard.  You're driving, and then you're stopped because the rain is coming down so hard, people can't  even see in front of them. 
[01:34:30]  That's how bad it gets.  Painting quite the picture.  Someone had to really get in some feedback.  Basically, something about Steve asking Master Pomer to talk louder into his lapel.  I don't know the exact words about it, but it's just the worst fucking guy.  I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions.  I'm going to have them answered immediately. 
[01:35:00]  Excuse me, can you talk louder?  Yeah, posthores.net, Clark, Master Pogue, can you say that a little louder and say that  by LaBelle?  That's a great line, bro.  Pogue's got a very dramatic delivery, though.  He's very intense.  He painted this horrific picture.  It's like that Day After Tomorrow movie that he's painting.  Let's continue.  So you're talking about barricading everybody in this place for a period of maybe several 
[01:35:30]  days.  Oh my God, what kind of hurricane are we talking about?  I don't know.  If you're talking about a severe, drastic hurricane that's coming in, first of all, why be here?  Right.  You know why?  Because the only reason why we're here is to do a show.  Well, guess what?  We won't have any electricity.  Oh.  Great answer, Steve. 
[01:36:00]  I can hear myself scrolling through the phone as I'm answering this.  We won't have any electricity.  Oh.  I won't.  Yeah, you're really good at how you keep leading Poe to other areas.  I'm terrible.  Where the comedy can keep coming.  I am terrible.  But you know what?  You have to understand that I'm the only person in the building at that point who's not going  to lose his mind laughing.  The option was me or Ben.  That was the choice.  When you throw those two in the mix, I think I was immediately elected. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  More.  Good point.  Imagine, no electricity, no computer ability, no access at all.  Do you know what's going to happen here?  Chaos.  Either Opie and Andy is going to make us all laugh, and Jimmy, well, Jimmy's not going to  be here, but Opie and Andy is going to make us laugh, or they're going to go crazy, and  they're going to drive us crazy.  Maybe we can count on them to be entertaining, but who knows?  Good one, Steve. 
[01:37:00]  You're welcome.  Did you get that one from Eric Logan?  Jeez.  All right.  A couple more clips here.  We've already talked about how to get open and home, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  What about you got interns that are coming from Staten Island, Jersey?  How would they get home?  We're talking about four kids who are going to have, Staten Island will be covered with  water, gentlemen.  A tidal wave will wash over them, destroying the island.  The drama in Posevois.  Very, very melodramatic delivery. 
[01:37:30]  Staten Island, write it off, kids.  It's gone.  Four kids who are going to have frightened parents at home.  And I'm assuming we're responsible for them.  Of course.  Okay, so if we're responsible for them, then either A, they stay here with grown-up adults  that can handle the situation, or...  Where?  Where are they?  As opposed to those childlike adults.  They get taken home.  But if we're worried about taking them home, and Anthony's going to be spending six hours 
[01:38:00]  getting home, getting to Long Island.  Well, like I said, if it's going to be that bad, Anthony shouldn't come in.  Right, right.  If it gets that bad, then no one should be coming in.  Right.  Give me the day off.  Hey, we got some great instant feedback coming in.  Rich from Allentown.  If the hurricane floods, Anthony is screwed.  He will not have any shoes from his shoelaces being wet.  Chris from Dallas, Texas.  Hmm, being trapped in an office with Steve the Bear and no food.  Make sure you keep the cameras rolling, kids. 
[01:38:30]  And Jimmy from Whackbag.com, Steve would hover above the water in his hybrid.  Certainly would.  All right, one more clip here.  Steve and Master Poe talking about an evacuation plan.  Or maybe not.  Nope.  Uh-oh.  Oh, boy.  Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.  All right, here we go.  All right, say you've got these kids.  Let's say, let's say, God forbid, this fucking hurricane. 
[01:39:00]  We're all dumb enough to come in.  He's getting tough on them now.  Yeah.  Where do we take, do you, do you have the ability to house any of these kids?  Would you feel comfortable enough taking any of these kids home?  My place is big.  If, um...  Is it fixed up enough?  Yeah, there's plenty of room.  They'll just sleep with the dogs.  With the dogs?  No, I'm kidding.  Jesus Christ, Poe.  Cool fuck.  Um, and then, I mean, shit, providing, providing you could get out, could you take kids home? 
[01:39:30]  I don't know why you're smiling, because let me tell you, this is a horror for me, man.  I just, I'm tired.  I really, I hate having these fucking conversations.  Oh.  I really do.  I fucking hate it.  This is what you call a nightmare.  All right?  And you're smiling, and I don't know why you're smiling.  This is a nightmare.  All right.  He shot in the head in a second.  This destroys houses.  This destroys homes.  This destroys family.  You know what's making this bit better?  For the listeners, Brian from posthores.net, oh yeah, you guys are just going to be sitting 
[01:40:00]  there telling jokes to everyone.  Who are you kidding?  Hope's going to be killing people for sport, and Anthony will be in the corner washing his  hands for hours on edge.  That goes on and on.  And while this is going on, I have Ben and Wicklin in the other office, and Don in the  other room, phoning in questions.  Oh, really? 
[01:40:30]  So I'm picking up the phone thinking it's somebody else, and I'm playing it off, but it's Don and  Ben in the other room phoning in questions.  All right.  Well, there you have it.  Master Poe's evacuation plan, courtesy of Steve.  Wow.  Very good, guys.  Thanks.  At least we're all safe.  And he did know, you know, stay home.  Thank you, guys.  Stay home.  Thanks, Master Poe.  Thank you, guys.  Yeah.  Yeah, that was riveting.  Yeah, wasn't it?  Terrible.  Hey, guys.  This is Master Poe.  You're listening to the worst of Master Poe. 
[01:41:00]  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony, featuring Travis.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Travis.  Holy mackerel, am I enjoying that radio program.  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[01:41:30]  My name is Travis.  And Than and Sam are along in the studio.  Just keep going with it.  All right.  Hey.  Jim Norton's one of the guys on the show.  And we had a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine lying around.  Oh, man.  What?  I'm excited.  Sometimes you just say stuff because I can hear you finishing a sentence and I'm just  kind of leading you to the next thing.  I like when you lead me.  All right.  We don't have to halt everything every time a sound is made.  He sounded sad.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Why? 
[01:42:00]  Sorry.  Why?  Why did he sound sad?  I see what you're doing there.  Yeah, there you go.  That was a test.  You failed.  All right.  Jim answers some advice from the advice column in Cosmopolitan magazine.  Hold it.  On the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Stop.  It's the worst.  Worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  All right.  Here we go.  Cosmopolitan.  Ask him anything.  Advice from our guy guru, Jonathan Small.  But instead of reading the answers from Jonathan Small, we'll have Jimmy answer these questions.  Okay.  All right.  Let's just give it a shot. 
[01:42:30]  See what happens.  You never know.  That's the beauty of this show.  Maybe we'll fall on our asses.  We don't know.  All right.  The question for this guy.  I've been hooking up.  It's a chick, obviously, talking here.  I've been hooking up with this guy for months, but he said he doesn't have time for a relationship.  Then he saw me flirting with another guy and told me that he doesn't want me hooking up with other people.  Does he have feelings for me?  Yes, he does.  Yeah. 
[01:43:00]  Hope he did a spit take.  Simple, but effective.  Holy shit.  All right.  Let's try the next one.  All right.  All right.  Good.  Let's go.  A few weeks ago.  That's a chick talking.  Okay. 
[01:43:30]  A few weeks ago, I was having family problems, and it made me super emotional.  During this time, my boyfriend and I had sex, and right before my orgasm, I burst into tears.  He was really sweet, but ever since then, we haven't had sex.  When I try to get him into bed, he tells me he's not in the mood.  How can I get him to sleep with me again?  You can't.  I like it.  Short and sweet.  Jimmy is truly an answer man.  We got another benchmark bit developing right in front of our eyes. 
[01:44:00]  I love it.  All right.  How about this?  My guy is great.  I could hear the promos already, by the way.  Jesus Christ.  Why did I do this to myself?  It's a trick talking.  But, of course, they'll edit that part out of it when you hear the promo.  My guy is great, but he's super hairy.  I'd love to ask him to wax his back, but I don't want to hurt his feelings.  What do I do?  Crash his website. 
[01:44:30]  Cross the terminals on his car battery.  I was in drive.  I went backwards.  Feed him two M&Ms and then watch him vomit for a half hour.  Old garbanzo bean belly.  Kick that fucking stomach is.  It's amazing because he has, you know, the stapled stomach.  He still has enough nutrition going in there to have a hairy back. 
[01:45:00]  It's amazing.  You would think something would suffer.  I can't figure that problem out.  It wouldn't have enough energy in your body to keep the hair growing.  He really is a fucking, just a Lebanese ass.  Holy crap.  I'm so full.  I had a jawbreaker for lunch.  Here's another one for Jimmy.  If a guy gives you his number but doesn't ask for yours, is he not interested?  There's a chick talking, obviously.  Chick talking. 
[01:45:30]  If a guy gives you his number but doesn't ask for yours, is he not interested?  Not necessarily.  Wow.  You're really pumping out those helpful answers.  Yeah.  I mean, you ask, I answer.  I really would.  I like thinking about that.  Guy gives the number, doesn't ask for hers.  Is it overconfidence or lack of confidence there?  Maybe it's, um, um, maybe he doesn't have a phone. 
[01:46:00]  But he gave her the number.  That's the beauty of it.  All right, here we go.  The final, the final one.  I think that's just saying, look, if, if, if, if you want to call me, call me.  If not, I'll hunt you down and kill you.  It's a way to be rejected, um, without having to look her in the face.  Or not put the pressure on her.  It's like, hey, if you're interested, here's my, my number.  I'm interested.  Yeah.  And if you're not, you're not.  Final question.  This is a chick talking. 
[01:46:30]  I've been with my guy for months and I'm really attracted to him, but he always pulls these  weird seduction moves that really turn me off.  For example, sometimes he'll do a little strip tease that reminds me of, of skeevy male  strippers.  It's so dorky.  How can I tell him to stop?  Just say, Hawk, stop it.  Swift kick in the ball sack.  Well, how about the next time he starts to strip, lay him on his back and shit in his  mouth. 
[01:47:00]  Like Pavlov's dog, he'll stop dancing.  Knowing that that shit is coming.  I want to show you what I think of your little dance.  It's the second big shit joke I did today.  I really am limited.  Don't want to dance.  Well, I think that was wonderful, Jimmy.  Thank you.  I think you helped a lot of people out out there.  Insightful.  It's not making people laugh, but it's about helping.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Travis.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it. 
[01:47:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  For this next bit here on the worst of Opie and Anthony, staff picks Travis edition.  Right.  The staff picks Travis.  I believe this is the bit where the term no homo was coined.  I think.  Don't quote me on that.  But this is intern Bobby no homo.  And I think he brought this phrase.  Hey, Sam, are you hearing what Travis said?  What?  He said he personally thought of no homo.  And it's in this bit.  I didn't say that.  Jesus Christ, Travis. 
[01:48:00]  Why don't you take credit for everything?  I said intern Bobby came up with it.  I was just quoting him.  Yeah.  No, don't quote me on that.  That's a funny bit.  I'm excited that you picked it.  This is a funny bit.  So I enjoyed it a lot.  Intern Bobby explains what no homo is.  Here on the worst of Opie and Anthony, Travis edition.  I think.  Sorry.  I'm laughing.  We also get gay chicken, I believe, is another product of this.  I think you're right.  All right.  This is a good bit.  I picked good bits.  Mm-hmm.  Opie and Anthony, worst of.  It's the worst.  Worst.  Of the Opie and Anthony show.  What's up, Bobby?  I loved you.  By the way, I loved you in the Babe Ruth story. 
[01:48:30]  Go ahead.  If you do something gay and you call no homo, it's not gay.  If you call no homo, those are the rules now?  That's a rule.  You could call no homo.  And you could do anything.  And as long as you say.  So you could suck a guy's cock and say no homo.  No homo.  You could say, I'll suck your dick no homo.  No homo.  But you're a homo.  Yeah.  What uncle convinced you that that was true?  The words.  Exactly.  Just say no homo.  No homo and it's not gay. 
[01:49:00]  Well, growing up, you always heard, like, you know, if you did something that was, like,  kind of faggy, you could always just say no homo beforehand and it kind of gets you  off the hook a little bit.  Example.  Like, as a joke, like, if my friends are talking to a girl, I'll just come up and kiss them  on the shoulder, like, centrally.  And, you know, you call no homo afterwards and it's all cool.  You know what I love about that story?  He wasn't kissing on the shoulder.  He changed it for the radio.  Where were you kissing?  Where were you kissing?  No, you kiss him right here.  Like, just nice and, like, one of those, soft.  That is really, like, gay, though.  Yeah.  It's kind of funny, though. 
[01:49:30]  Never.  You taste the musky man's sweat on him when you do that on your lips?  No, you try not to taste.  Does it linger there long enough?  It's mostly about the sound it makes because it makes a nice little smacking sound.  Or kiss Jimmy on the shoulder.  Let's see how this would work.  I prefer not to.  No, he really wants to see how this works.  Just kiss him on the shoulder.  It'll be okay.  He's playing up for the radio.  Maybe you could just call no homo.  Yeah, no homo, Jimmy.  I mean, it's not gay.  No, I would yell, go homo, because that's what you'd have to do.  Leave. 
[01:50:00]  Go homo.  All right.  Thanks, Bobby.  That was terrific.  Well, I want another example.  I know there's another one.  You don't just yell out once in your teenage life.  All right.  If, you know, I fuck with my friends.  Like, they're walking on the block.  I'll just, like, grab the pot, like, under their ass.  I'm like, did you shit your pants?  And, like, you'd call no homo on that.  Wait, you would grab, like, his taint?  Well, not really grab it.  Just, like, put your hand there and go, you know, did you shit your pants, bro?  You would, like, slide your hand in under his ass.  Well, I'm not fingering him.  I'm not getting...  No, I understand, but you would slide your hand.  How far would your hand go? 
[01:50:30]  Uh...  Like, to the balls?  Not, no.  You don't grab balls.  It's just, like, the ass.  I know you don't grab.  I'm just saying, you would slide.  They're walking.  You would slide your hand.  Well, if you get...  I've done it to Sean before.  If you get Sean, just make him walk by.  Piece of shit did it to me, too.  Holy shit.  He thinks I'm the guy that you get to do your little gay tricks to?  Did he say no homo?  No, he didn't even say no homo.  So he really just wanted to touch my ass. 
[01:51:00]  Let's get Sean in here.  I want to see this, because I'm not grasping what's going on.  Thank you for bringing another volunteer show.  How far that'll go.  It's not going to be entertaining all set up, so...  It doesn't matter.  It's not for entertainment.  Just act.  Make like you're just doing it naturally.  It was completely unentertaining.  Wait, what did he do to you, Nathaniel?  He did this trick.  What is it?  Like, he goes in the pants?  What's the trick?  Apparently, he just touches sort of the slack in your pants in the back, if you have some.  If you're lucky enough to have some. 
[01:51:30]  Because if you don't, it's your ass.  And then says, did you shit your pants?  So he would walk by.  Stand up.  You guys stand up.  Stand up.  Fluff it up a little bit.  Walk by.  Just come this way.  Stay there.  Walk by.  Walk by.  You just come up behind and go, faggot.  Bro, do you shit your pants?  And you just put your hand right there.  Oh, my God.  You are dead.  Dude, this guy is the biggest faggot.  I didn't say it.  You swiped right up his butt crack.  You swiped from his taint up to his butt crack.  I didn't really feel anything.  Like, I'm not grabbing bowls at all. 
[01:52:00]  That's sexual harassment.  Dude, the first week I was here.  That's how I felt, to be honest.  What?  Travis, get in here.  I have a trick.  The first week I was here, I was trying to take a piss in the bathroom, and he comes  up behind me and starts grabbing my ass and kissing me on the shoulder and shit.  Dude, you are so gay.  He's a faggot, man.  It's no homo.  Are you realizing this?  It's no homo.  It's no homo.  Did he say no homo?  No.  No, he did.  It's always real homo.  It's all homo.  He says the no homo thing.  He brings that up.  But in any of these cases, he's never used no homo. 
[01:52:30]  Bro, you ever grab a cock and lick it and laugh?  No.  It's all right.  It's fine.  You just say, so what?  You like men.  And you guys don't even know each other?  And after your first week here?  The first week I was here.  Jesus.  And now this has become like a daily thing.  He gropes me.  He's exaggerating.  He's exaggerating.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Is he groping you, son?  Yeah.  What else has he done to you?  If you're sitting there, he'll just grab your dick real quick and walk away.  Stop.  Don't tell me you haven't done that, man.  That's ridiculous.  You've done that every time on the computer.  Now you're being ridiculous.  I'm on the computer and you grab my dick and you walk away. 
[01:53:00]  That's being ridiculous.  Wait, you grabbed.  He's being.  You're being.  That's totally ridiculous.  You've done it like five times.  Dude, that's ridiculous.  Whatever.  That's ridiculous.  Hold on now.  Yeah.  Is he a big boy?  I don't know.  He doesn't like take a hold of it, but he, you know, touches it a little and leaves.  What the hell's going on here after we leave?  I think he's exaggerating.  I'm going to be honest.  Have you touched his package in any way?  Don't lie.  In front of his pants.  Don't lie.  I didn't touch the front of his pants. 
[01:53:30]  Well, what happened, Sean?  That's exactly what happened.  He touched my pants.  He, like, grazed it.  Ooh.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to get you hot there, but.  Nathaniel, what'd you do?  Because, I mean.  Yeah, you're not quite the kind of guy that really puts up with that kind of stuff.  When he played no homo with you, what'd you do?  When he played that gay no homo thing.  I quite literally turned around and said, don't ever fucking touch me again.  I screamed.  I really yelled.  I made a scene.  Wow.  Why don't you say, hey, you masher?  This man's annoying me, officer. 
[01:54:00]  Masher.  I hear that's what you're supposed to do.  Make a scene.  Wait, walk us.  He'd blow you a whistle?  Hit him with your pocketbook.  Masher.  Walk us through it.  How did this go down?  I was, I don't know, standing amongst the cubicles and talking to Travis, you know, about  work, I'm sure.  And he comes up behind me and says, did you shit your pants whilst touching me?  I could feel like I'm in therapy.  Holy shit. 
[01:54:30]  That makes me sound really gay, though.  It really is not supposed to be gay.  Exactly.  I'm sorry.  Paint it the hot straight way.  The funny way.  It's a great way for a gay guy to try to find other gay guys in a work environment.  Yeah.  You're trolling.  You're trolling for gay guys.  Have you done it to Steve?  No.  Of course not.  I bet you can't keep your hands off of Ben's, though.  That fucking cock has got to be begging to be grazed.  Wow.  He's got to freaking ride it like one of those banana boat rides when you go down the Caribbean. 
[01:55:00]  Now, why wouldn't you do it to, why would you do it to certain people but not others?  Is it that you find others more attractive for this?  It's not something I think about.  It's like stupid bullshit me and friends of mine doing school, like, just joking around.  But, like, why wouldn't you do it to Steve?  I don't, I never really thought about it, I'm going to be honest.  So, how many times have you touched Sean's cock?  It's not a big deal.  We're all friends.  I never touched Sean's cock.  How many times have you grazed the area?  I've never, it sounds, I never grazed the area.  It's bullshit, he's saying.  You've done it at least five times. 
[01:55:30]  At least five.  I count it every time.  He plays no, why not playing no hetero?  You can have a little more fun playing no hetero.  Never thought about it that way.  Yeah, grab their tits and yell, no rape.  Although, it turns out you're just no hetero.  Steve, what would you do if he did that to you?  If he came up behind you and.  Beat the ever-loving shit out of him.  Yeah.  He'd come immediately.  What was that?  I'm sorry.  No, you can repeat it.  I didn't say anything.  No, he didn't say anything.  We were just laughing.  I said he'd beat the shit out of him.  Yeah.  All right.  I'm sure. 
[01:56:00]  Anyone else been touched?  You're groped?  Not me yet.  So, Nathaniel, what'd you do after that?  I was kind of distracted.  I just yelled like a.  A girl?  A woman in a subway.  Yes.  And then you'd have to.  Ash.  You'd mash her.  Nathaniel went home and took a Brillo pad shower.  Oh.  That's violation.  Yeah.  And I think, I mean, to do it to Sean's one thing, because he's of your station.  But I was annoyed that you were that comfortable that you could do that to me.  I realized that afterwards.  Just in time, asshole. 
[01:56:30]  So, Nathaniel is saying that you don't mind.  Like, you understand why he would want to graze the other intern.  Yeah.  But when it comes to the employees.  Hands off.  Hands off, pal.  You kissed Bill.  Don't touch the merchandise.  Where's Bill?  I don't think you see it there.  He's not here.  Damn it.  Is it true you kissed Bill on the shoulder on Friday?  Well, yeah.  That's the gag.  He did that to me a bunch of times, too.  How many is a bunch, Sean?  Like, in the elevator this morning, there was a guy in a business suit.  So, I just went, hey.  And I just smooched him on the shoulder.  Do you understand that no one wants to play?  And one time. 
[01:57:00]  You're the only one that's into the gag.  Is gay enough.  One time to do the joke is gay enough.  To do it repeatedly is so gay.  No matter how many times you say no gay, so gay.  I'm not gay, so, you know, I guess.  How old were you when you first, when you and your friend just kind of masturbated together  and kind of, like, laughed it off after?  Don't lie.  It happens. 
[01:57:30]  Don't lie.  I never had a homosexual experience.  That's not true.  Per se.  Per se.  You grabbed my cock.  That's not a homosexual experience.  Yeah, I mean, around this office, you're known as a slut at this point.  Sounds like the last nice episode of The Sopranos.  Here's Bill.  Here's Bill the intern.  Bill.  Hey, what's going on?  How do you do?  Bill, did Bobby kiss you on the shoulder on Friday?  Did he?  I don't think he did.  I don't remember this.  I don't remember Friday, to be honest. 
[01:58:00]  He just doesn't remember the entire day of Friday.  Yeah, I don't.  If he did, I didn't notice it.  So he's never played no homo with you?  No.  I guess he plays no homo with everybody around here.  Oh, does he?  Oh, I can hear him say stuff to people.  That sounds kind of gay.  Like what?  Oh, the way he talks to little John.  Who's little John?  This other guy.  Oh, John with the short arms?  No.  No, John's the other kid. 
[01:58:30]  Brock's trying to hear.  No, no, no.  The camera.  We have no idea.  Oh, a child star.  Child star that's grown up.  Oh, yeah.  You like him?  He's the one I'd go after.  Well, I'd tell him I'd hold him down and fuck him because he's so cute.  But it's not serious.  I'm not going to really hold him down and fuck him.  You grabbed Nathaniel's ass.  You want to hold that boy down and fuck him.  You kissed Bill's shoulder.  And you've kissed Sean's shoulder, grabbed his ass, and touched his cock area.  So, apparently, I would like Sean the best, according to your description. 
[01:59:00]  Wow.  How old were you when you first mutually masturbated with another boy?  I never mutually masturbated with someone.  I promise.  That 100%.  Bill, what have you heard?  Well, I'm not going to say all right what I've heard, but Bob has some stories about  when he was watching porn with friends, though.  All right.  You were watching porn with your friends, and what happened?  What happened?  You rubbed it through your pants?  I've watched porn with my friends before.  And?  You know, you watch porn with your friends.  And then?  One friend. 
[01:59:30]  A friend.  One goes to the bathroom, jerks off, and, you know, that's what happens.  And then the other one does.  Yeah.  You all take turns.  That's what happened.  You know, stopwatch.  It had to be 7th, 8th grade like that.  I don't know.  Bill, is that the story?  Yeah, it sounds about right.  It sounds about right.  Bill, you rock.  Hold on, man.  We got John.  John, the other intern.  John.  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Former child star.  What's up?  Hey, on Friday, Bobby pulled the, you shit your pants on me, as well as multiple kisses 
[02:00:00]  on the shoulder.  So let's just say it's been uncomfortable the last couple of days there.  Holy shit.  Who knew this was going on?  Who knew all this cock was being slung around the office the minute we walked out?  I don't know how to quit you.  He's a fag.  And how did that make you feel, John?  Not very well.  I've been looking at Bobby like a total faggot he has the last couple of days.  Oh, you like that, don't you, faggot? 
[02:00:30]  Wow.  Who saw this coming?  And he was brave enough to do it to Nathaniel.  He's kissed my shoulder, too.  He did?  Wait a minute.  You're a little tall to be a victim.  You're a fucking jujitsu guy.  What's wrong with you?  Well, I don't really know if it merits beating the shit out of him.  Yeah, Nathaniel should have kicked him like Matthew Shepard.  You should have played no spleen with him.  Nothing?  No, I'm thinking about Nathaniel.  Actually, Bobby.  Are you saying I'm inviting this, Jim?  I'm saying that you're like the woman in the office who just didn't want to cause trouble.  You're asking for it, the way you're dressed. 
[02:01:00]  Yeah.  I think you're dressing a little too sexy lately, Nathaniel.  Yeah, provocative.  You come in here after that fat smash diet, showing off your svelte body.  Who didn't want to touch it?  All right, well, everyone's very uncomfortable with Bobby and his no homo game.  Yeah, he never said no homo once to me.  Of course he wouldn't.  He just came up with that today.  I guess he'll explain everything.  I never heard no homo before.  That was a preemptive strike, he did.  Just kind of try to make it all better before all this came out. 
[02:01:30]  If you had to sleep with one of the other guys, which one would it be?  I wouldn't sleep with a guy.  If you had to.  I wouldn't.  I'm not saying that, I'm saying if you had to.  Oh, come on.  I don't know how to play this game.  I wish you did.  Dude, it's the oldest radio bit in the world.  Wouldn't sleep with a guy.  Yeah, if you had to.  If you had to.  Well, I wouldn't.  That's not an acceptable answer.  You're on the air.  If you had to.  I understand that, and that's why I'm not going to have to pick one.  I would not.  All right, Bobby.  Who's your favorite guy around the office to pull that did you shit your pants on? 
[02:02:00]  It's not something that, like, all right, look, I want to go after this guy.  It's just, I don't think about it.  But who's your favorite?  Who have you had the most fun kissing on the shoulder and touching their ass?  It's not a fun thing to do it.  I don't get an excitement at doing it.  I think it's funny when other people see it.  Why do you do it?  Because other people see it, and then they think it's uncomfortable, and I just laugh.  It's like a little.  So you think it's fun?  I think it's funny.  So who is it the most fun with?  The most funny to do it to you?  It doesn't matter.  It's all the same thing.  Who have you enjoyed it the most with?  I didn't enjoy it with anyone.  That's not true. 
[02:02:30]  You wouldn't do it to everybody.  Obviously, you didn't do it to Steve, so you know that wouldn't be fun.  Well, I guess.  And probably not as fun.  I wouldn't kiss Steve on the shoulder.  He doesn't wear sleeves.  But now I'm thinking you touched him more than probably anybody, so it's more fun.  Well, he's around me the most, so he's just near me the most.  What were you going to say, Danny?  I was just going to say that he's never even come close to doing any of this shit with me.  So it's obvious that Bobby has favorites of who likes to pull up.  Danny's hurt. 
[02:03:00]  I am hurt.  God damn it.  I have good cheeks.  Danny is hurt.  Well, another thing is, Danny and Travis, they're always running around during the show,  so I don't have a lot of contact with them.  So I'm idle.  Well, no.  So I'm gay and idle.  Thank you.  Yeah.  Dan, that faggot that just stands around and does nothing.  You're asking for it.  That's not what I meant, but usually I'm in contact with the interns more, obviously.  Yeah, sure.  In close contact, apparently.  Don't play no homo with us.  Sean, how many times has he grazed your cock, Danny? 
[02:03:30]  I would have to say at least five.  How does he graze your cock?  What are you doing?  I am having trouble picturing this.  I'm not going to touch his cock.  No, don't touch his cock.  Just tell us.  If I'm him and he walks by, he just calms out.  He goes like that and walks away.  A little snatch of the cock.  He'll reach his hand in when you're sitting.  Yeah.  And kind of just grab your cock.  And give a quick grab and then leave.  How would I do it while you were sitting?  You wouldn't defend against it, obviously.  If you were sitting down.  I can't see you.  But it looks like you come up behind, which is probably used to, and then just grab real 
[02:04:00]  quick.  And then run away.  And you wouldn't.  And then you keep walking.  Nothing happens.  I don't know.  I have a problem with what?  Do I come over your shoulder?  I'm trying to figure this out myself.  Dude.  You're trying to plant it.  Yeah, I know.  You can just go like that.  It's really.  Oh, yeah?  And you wouldn't.  You just go like that and I wouldn't be able to grab you.  Try to do it to me, and I bet you I could, you know.  Try to do it to me.  I could have tried it to, too.  You just asked him to grab your cock.  Yeah, try to do it to me, and I'll see.  Look, yeah. 
[02:04:30]  He's just begging for it.  You can't do it to me.  Oops, you got me.  Yeah.  Try again.  So, now, did he ever, like, did he ever push the spongy part through the jeans?  And no one has heard this no homo part of the game, right?  Bill?  No, I'm not really too sure.  I hear things around.  I never hear no homo.  I'm not even sure what that is, to be honest.  Well, that means you're not gay.  You get to do gay stuff.  But as long as you say no homo, you're not gay.  Oh, no.  I'm unaware of any of that.  John, no homo? 
[02:05:00]  Not at all.  This kid's pretty homo.  But he's never done that to me.  I mean, in fact, he did it to me in front of Steve the other day.  Steve was walking in the Rana Fez office, and he did it right in front of him.  And Steve knew he was a faggot right there.  Steve, comment?  Yeah, he was asking me.  He was saying, Steve, is this gay?  And he would kiss his shoulder.  And I said, yeah, that's gay.  And it was, yeah, John was typing, trying to do work.  And he was kissing his shoulder.  Wow, that's a little weird.  I don't like the fact that John's voice is 32 years, 30 years too old. 
[02:05:30]  Forget it.  I knew where you were going.  The voice definitely doesn't match him.  He sounds like Scorch.  Yeah.  All right, John.  We'll see you soon, all right?  All right, man.  See you later.  Later, old man voice.  Bobby, thanks.  All right.  Well, enough with the no homo thing, please.  Cool.  Sashay back to work.  Before someone really just pops you hard.  Grabbing ass.  All right, he's grabbing, he's grabbing everyone's kissing men.  I remember I got to side with Bobby on one thing. 
[02:06:00]  The first time I ever saw a porno was with my friend.  I had never seen it.  We watched on his dad's VCR.  Because back then, no one had him.  It was called the fur trap.  And we were both sitting on his parents' bedroom floor.  Not touching each other, just sitting there.  I actually had to excuse myself.  I was so blown away by it.  And I had to go and lay on his parents' bathroom floor and jerk off.  Wow.  Yeah.  That's what I did.  I wasn't prepared for that.  Couldn't wait.  I'd never seen one.  In front of everybody?  No, no, alone. 
[02:06:30]  It was just me and him watching.  In front of everybody.  And I excused myself just to go lay on the floor and jerk off.  Oh, okay.  I was distracted because Ben came running in with another victim.  Morning, fellas.  Hi, man.  Yeah, Bobby's grabbed my ass on a couple of occasions.  What has he done?  Like, how does he do it?  Let's say I have to go print something out to make a copy.  I have to, like, semi-bend over to make a copy.  And he'll pinch my ass.  I won't hit him because I want a job here, but... 
[02:07:00]  Look what you have to deal with.  It's getting a little much, right?  Because you're scared you're going to get fired.  Look, man, I give permission to any freaking guy that gets touched by Bobby to turn around and punch him in the face.  My problem is why there's 30 men that he's molested.  Why has nobody come forward?  No, they're also riddled with guilt.  Even Fan, who's an employee here, just kind of took it and kept it and cried into his pillow.  This is the one guy that works behind the scenes that I'm scared of, by the way.  So I'm very impressed that you didn't do anything to him. 
[02:07:30]  Maybe you can build him a cake.  That's wonderful.  So what, you bend over at the copier?  No, I don't really bend.  It's like semi-arch over and, like, I don't do that shit no more, but...  Yeah, now he's around.  That'll purge itself.  And did he pinch or rub or do that thing where he...  It was like a semi-weird pinch, semi-rub type homo shit.  I don't...  Were your buttocks protruding or was it like a kind of...  Nah, well, like, I naturally got a fat ass because I'm Spanish, so I guess it's pinchable. 
[02:08:00]  So what'd you think?  I was gonna smack the shit out of him, but then I was told you can't really hit anybody  if you work with them, so...  Yeah.  They just let it go.  This guy is just sexually harassing everyone in here.  I got a fat ass because I'm Spanish.  This guy's alright, man.  I like it.  What are you doing working today?  Just interning today.  The Yankees don't play, so I don't work.  Yeah, but why aren't you...  Nah, that's an excuse.  I need a job.  Yeah, see? 
[02:08:30]  Yeah.  Alright.  Very cool.  So what about...  What's Bobby gonna do?  Does he do a lot of stuff for Fez?  Nah.  Yeah.  That's amazing.  So there's only one guy in here that isn't complaining.  Nathaniel, Sean, John, Bill...  What's your name again?  Jay.  Jay.  That's five.  I think there's another one or two.  Six or seven guys.  Fan, an update, or anything?  Do you remember something else he did while you pretended you were eating cotton candy?  You knew it. 
[02:09:00]  If you just go through some hypnotherapy.  There's some...  I don't know if we want to keep talking about Bobby, but some of his hygiene habits are awfully  borderline gay.  Borderline gay?  Yeah.  Just where he nares.  He uses nair.  Yeah.  Where does he nair?  Bobby, I'll call him.  Oh, Jesus.  Where does he nair?  I'm thinking...  I'm thinking...  He's coming.  He might be able to describe it better than me.  I can't see any reason for this. 
[02:09:30]  Hold that thought for a second.  We got another gay or funny really fast.  Parrot lungs.  Parrot lungs, what's up?  Parrot lungs.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just want to say it's hilarious.  See, the whole time on the display of the sky fight says, Bobby is gay.  It's funny.  Yeah.  Anyway, me and the boys have a fishing weekend, and we all have to shower in the same building  or whatever, but my buddy is doing the dishes, and one of the other guys comes out of the  shower, just drops his towel, goes up behind him, and hugs him from behind naked. 
[02:10:00]  Gay.  I don't know.  That's kind of funny if you're with all your friends.  See, the thing that's funny about that as opposed to gay is that it's in front of everybody, right?  Yes.  Yeah, that's kind of...  When you're doing something so...  It's ballsy and funny.  Yeah, that's...  And he kind of rested his head against his back, like, lovingly.  I don't know.  That could be both.  It could be, but that's more funny.  If you do it when you're alone, that's kind of borderline. 
[02:10:30]  But if you do it when your friends are all watching, does everybody laugh at them?  Everybody.  How do you not fucking roll watching that?  That's a hoot.  All right.  I like it.  Okay, then.  Very good.  Let's go to Gary in New Jersey.  Gary, what's up?  Hey, how you doing, bros?  Hey, Gary.  Hey, ball sack thing gets funny when the guy walks out with a big smile on his face, and  then it changes the horror as he gets stuck in his zipper.  And then it turns gay again when he asks for help from somebody to rob it and make it feel 
[02:11:00]  better.  And when you picked up the phone, your call turned awful.  All right.  Thank you.  So back to Bobby.  You nair where?  Put him next to me.  I nair actually...  I nair my body sometimes.  You know, like, when I was going away, I'll shave my chest and...  Going away, what, to prison?  Fire Island?  Well, Jamaica, but I would shave my chest and my, you know, pubic region and nair my 
[02:11:30]  ass and, you know, whatever.  Nair your ass?  Yes.  Because you can't really shave in there.  That would...  In where?  Your ass.  So your whole crack?  In your crack?  Well, your balls, your taint, the whole area.  So you just slather nair on there and up your ass crack?  I guess so, yes.  Why would you have...  Why would you nair your ass crack?  Why is there a need to be completely hairless?  Well, it's not that there's a need.  It's just it's easier for when, you know, you're wiping. 
[02:12:00]  It's very cleanly.  And if you want girls to play with that area, girls, yes, girls, you know, you're going  to want to be nice and tidy.  Yeah, say girls another ten times.  Chicks.  Yeah, you know.  Broads.  Yeah, you know.  Tomatoes.  You know.  But I just ask Steve for porn all the time.  Of course you do, because there's cocks in it.  And he never brings in the right type, does he?  Does he now?  You might not like this.  It's all girls.  So you nair your ass crack? 
[02:12:30]  All right.  Yes, I have on that.  Not gay.  No gay.  No homo.  No homo.  No homo.  See?  I can't even remember.  No homo.  No homo.  All right, Bobby.  Thank you.  All right.  There he goes.  Out to harass...  Oh, no.  What do we got?  More victims?  Maybe.  I'm going to go find out.  What?  There may be more victims?  Yeah, that might be...  Look, they're turning up.  It's like the Gacy basement. 
[02:13:00]  I feel bad for Jay here.  He's just trying to make a living.  He's trying to...  You like radio and all, right?  Yeah, man.  Uh-oh.  Something else is going on.  Uh-oh.  Okay, we're being told to ask to see his tattoo.  All right.  Shit.  Right here.  Share.  Let's see your tattoo.  I'm not going to take out my tattoo, because it's in a spot that I would have to pull down  my pants.  Who cares?  Who cares at this point?  We all know you're gay.  But you know what?  I have proof this is because of a girl, because I called up your show. 
[02:13:30]  Do you have underwear on?  Yes, I do.  Tell me.  What is it, Jimmy?  I can't see.  Turn this way.  That is as close to your ball sack as you could get on your thigh.  It's a black rose, right?  And it's a black rose.  It's a black rose just off his junk on the upper inner thigh, as high up as you can go.  Maybe it's a word play in his own mind, because he likes black dick.  Black grows.  Oh, yeah.  That could be.  What does it mean?  It was, I broke up with a chick, and I got the tattoo. 
[02:14:00]  I was kind of bummed about it.  And it's, I have proof.  Why did you break up with her?  Was she missing something?  Uh, no.  We, you know, we kind of had our, you know, it was on the outs.  But I have proof of that, because I did call up this show, the XM show, and there's a  whole, there's like a, there's a good 10 minute call on it.  Oh.  That was brought up, so it is on a girl.  Wait, what was the call?  It was, I was bummed out about my chick, and just talking about stuff, and how I used to  do all like, like dirty things with her, and Jimmy was giving me advice.  Of course he was.  Were we playing music for you?  Just touch men's asses. 
[02:14:30]  You feel better.  Yeah.  Ask me if they shit their pants, LOL.  I'm not sure if you guys play music for it, but it was brought up on, um, it was brought  up on Ron and Fez when I started working there, and they, they definitely play music for it.  Yeah.  But, um, it was over a girl.  That's, that's 100% true.  Wow.  But they're not really broken up, because you just said, no homo.  Yeah.  And she forgave him, and they're back dating.  I'm not, I'm not saying that you're, you know, probably haven't had, you know, you've  had girlfriends and, and things like that. 
[02:15:00]  There's just something going on.  Mm-hmm.  There's just something going on where maybe there's some confusion in you, or, uh, I don't  know, doubt, uh, curiosity.  Uh, there's no other excuse for, for your actions except trolling.  You're looking for one of these guys to, you know, go, ooh, or, or, you know, give you  a little sign or a signal that it's okay to continue.  In all fairness, I do it in jest, and I don't get excited sexually. 
[02:15:30]  Yeah.  I, I, I don't.  But look at poor Jay over here.  He looks like a victim.  Jay?  Yeah.  Anything you want to say to Bobby?  Yeah, no.  Ain't no Johnny Cakes over here, man.  We'll touch you.  Johnny Cakes.  It's, I think what everybody's saying is that while you do resemble a young, vibrant Donald  Pleasence, then appreciate it if you didn't touch their backsides.  Yeah, let's not touch anyone's backsides anymore.  That's all.  How many of the victims want this to continue?  Show your hands. 
[02:16:00]  Um, none.  Did you ever think you were making people uncomfortable with this?  Oh, yeah.  That was, that's the joke of it.  That's the joke.  Yeah, it's, it's very uncomfortable.  But there's like.  A whoopee cushion's a joke.  That's, like, gay.  Yeah, there's uncomfortable, like, what Jim does in elevators and stuff.  And then there's molestation.  Physical contact.  Sexual harassment, right.  I guess I got the joke wrong, then.  All right.  Yeah.  Thank you, Bobby.  Uh, thanks to Jay, this poor kid.  Thanks, Jay.  Thanks, guys. 
[02:16:30]  Just trying to work hard and make a living, and he's got to have his freaking, uh, Spanish  ass crap.  Juicy Spanish, bud.  Ooh, plump.  That's why he wears baggy pants.  He's so tired of showing off the merchandise.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Featuring Travis.  Yeah.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  7-7.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  It's the worst.  It's the worst.  Of Opie and Anthony. 
[02:17:00]  Featuring Travis.  It's the worst.  He's reached his potential.  This is as far as he can go.  This is it.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  Vila Jovovich.  Hi.  How are you?  Those are some pretty hot pictures.  Oh, my God.  We should have covered those up.  What pictures are those?  German magazine, probably.  That's a really good question.  Where did we get those pictures?  Uh, some pervert on the staff, uh, printed them out.  Oh, we got her face on someone else's body writer.  That must be it.  That's gotta be it.  No.  You know what?  Why don't we have pictures from the fifth element? 
[02:17:30]  That's what we should have.  Listen, I'm kinda glad that I don't have anything from the fifth element.  You know what?  That could go on this wall, actually.  You do.  When you're in the little...  You do!  When you're in that little thing just made up of some, like, gauze, it looked like, kind  of wrapped around you?  Well, I guess if that turns you on, gauze, man, that hospital thing was real sexy.  Do you think...  Do you think, in the fifth element, when you came out and you were in just that thing that  was kind of strips all around you, that that wasn't really hot, that guys weren't watching 
[02:18:00]  going, oh.  Because, uh...  Let me be the first to inform you, a few years later, it was very hot.  A few years later.  It was a very nice costume, and then you're flying around all over the place, jumping out  windows on top of flying taxi cabs, and nothing came out.  Like, that looked like an unsecured little outfit you were wearing.  Were you glued in there?  Well, you know, she's a super being, so, you know, it all keeps together.  Was it duct taped and stuff?  Well, no, the whole thing was sort of one piece, so it was kind of like a bathing suit. 
[02:18:30]  Oh, we were...  Kind of like a wet bathing suit.  Yeah.  It certainly was.  That's like one of the most memorable parts of that movie, though, is you wearing that  get-up.  I know.  That was a crazy character.  That was fun.  Yeah.  Jumping off the building.  And then, of course, the Evil Dead.  Evil Dead.  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil.  Evil Dead sucks, man.  It's Resident Evil.  Oh, my God. 
[02:19:00]  You're getting dead a lot of people.  Evil Dead's kind of cool, too.  Got to give it that, but...  There's a lot of Evil Dead fans out there.  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil.  Resident Evil.  I saw you naked.  Wait, she was naked in that?  I saw you naked.  Okay, for a second, you see, like...  It was for a second.  ...boobs for a second.  Wow.  And then I saw it on, I guess, regular TV.  And, like, I'm waiting for that part to come.  And they cut it out.  Damn it.  It's kind of like seeing, like, the TV version of Scarface. 
[02:19:30]  Yeah.  He's like, this city is a chicken.  Just waiting to be flogged.  We did a whole thing on our show about that.  The TV edits.  So wonderful.  I can watch the TV edit over.  Oh, you like that?  I love it.  Are you kidding?  It's so wonderful.  They put in scenes that were deleted because they're so violent.  They'll put in scenes that never made the real movie.  Like, these scenes that are now on the DVD.  These awful scenes that meant nothing.  Yeah, the cutting room floor scenes.  Yeah.  Flying into him driving and looking for an address.  Well, I've never heard, you know, beep that, you know, replaced with, not that! 
[02:20:00]  Yeah.  I was like, wow, that was kind of real, too.  Not that!  They really reach.  Some not a Scarface thing.  You know, it's very kind of sophisticated.  Not that!  I guess these days they do two versions sometimes and have the actor actually doing a clean version.  Listen, that was so genius.  The things they pulled out the box for that, like, no one does today. 
[02:20:30]  Yeah.  I mean, a chicken waiting to be plucked?  That's genius.  Someone got paid to think of that and come up with it.  Who thinks of that stuff?  And they were in a room going, oh, good one, good one.  I didn't think we were going to get one for that.  That's kind of like a cool hobby to, like, find, like, all the TV versions,  like the funniest TV versions of, like, the most violent movies, because I think those  are kind of amazing.  Like, you have these limits, and you've got to do your best with them, you know?  Yeah.  So you're like a chicken waiting to be plucked.  You know?  Wonderful!  I got it.  You ever see your own dialogue replaced on TV or something and kind of laugh? 
[02:21:00]  Like, that doesn't even sound like me.  Well, those things are really funny.  I mean, every time I have to do a TV version, you know, we're always kind of, like, trying to  think of, like, what can you possibly say?  You know, of course, I hadn't seen Scarface, the TV version at that point.  So, you know, we were just doing, like, flickity-flock and, like, you know, just, you know, oh,  dit, or something, you know?  And they're like, no, that sounds too much like...  It sounds too much like the bad word.  Hey, I got it.  The T word. 
[02:21:30]  Yeah.  I don't even know if you can say that on the radio.  Tit?  Tit.  Oh.  Let me fill you in on something, Mila.  You're in the world of satellites.  Let me fill you in on a little something, Mila.  You're in the world of satellites.  Are we actually on the air right now?  Yes.  Completely on the air.  You know what's funny about that?  So many guests will ask that exact question.  I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  We will have 10, 15-minute conversations, and people will go, so when are we going to go  on the air?  I know.  I'm glad my mom's not watching.  She's like, you're on the radio, and all you can think to say is a chick and waiting 
[02:22:00]  to be blacked.  I hate to tell you, it doesn't get much better than that, so enjoy your time.  And if your mom's watching the radio, you might want to have a little talk to her.  That's true.  That's true.  It's kind of early.  I haven't gotten through my coffee yet.  Are you generally maybe a potty mouth in regular life, or do you?  Oh, look.  You know, as I fiddle with the pen.  Oh, you might not want to touch any of those pens.  Yeah, we don't know.  People chew on them. 
[02:22:30]  Pluck that, man.  Oh, she told you.  I want her to curse.  Give us a curse.  Give us a curse.  No, no, no.  I can't.  You're doing a movie.  Listen, I might do it just by accident anyway, so I just should try and control it.  Is that what happens, though, when you're out and about?  You kind of just throw up, pepper it in.  Pluck this, pluck that, pluck you, pluck everything.  She's having a good time.  She's got some very lucrative deals.  She doesn't want to screw up is what she's talking about.  She shouldn't be on this show.  I see it.  What makeup spots are you on? 
[02:23:00]  L'Oreal.  Yeah, L'Oreal.  Yes.  And she comes out with her big eyes, big blue eyes.  Pluck that.  L'Oreal.  You started out as a model?  I started, well, my mom was an actress in Russia when I was growing up back in the 70s.  And so I started acting.  Saw her on TV?  I was like nine.  Back then?  Actually, not on TV because, you know, in the 70s, TVs were a little harder to come by.  But on the big screen, yeah, I would go to my mom and see her, like, doing ADR for movies and stuff. 
[02:23:30]  So kind of followed in her footsteps.  So I started when I was nine acting and then fell into modeling when I was seven.  You know, the weirdest part of that whole answer was that TVs were hard to come by.  We just can't.  Well, it was the Russia.  No, I know.  As an American, you just can't understand that you would actually grow up without a TV.  Well, I mean, yeah, I guess by the 70s, everyone had TVs in America.  Not that way in the motherland.  So how would you watch TV?  But how would you watch TV?  Just one family member somewhere would have it?  Well, no, we had a TV.  Right.  But if your mom's doing movies. 
[02:24:00]  We were like 0.1% that probably had one kind of thing.  So everyone came over to your house to watch the TV.  Yeah, kind of thing.  Was there American TV back then?  Like any shows?  No.  Why not?  I'm joking.  There was hardly Americans in the rest of the people.  They didn't like anything back then.  No, but I understand.  We go over Miller's house.  They have toilet paper and blue jeans.  I'm fucking on the black market.  Maybe you get a VHS of Dallas or something shipped over.  I don't know.  Jesus.  Back then they didn't want any Western stuff being beaten in. 
[02:24:30]  But it was still being.  It was all just like everything wonderful here today.  Sky is blue.  Government loves you.  That was pretty much all they wanted the people knowing back then.  This is like the most awful thing is that it's so true.  It's so not funny.  And then like Western information stuff started encroaching on.  And after everybody said, I'm leaving.  I could drive a cab and make some money. 
[02:25:00]  Pluck this chicken.  Oh, my God.  So when did you make your way here?  Yeah.  When did you escape?  Well, we did actually.  We came over and never went back.  Did you?  You left when it was still communist?  I'm still here.  There's somebody still at the house, like some KGB agent waiting. 
[02:25:30]  Where is Mila?  She said she was going out to get me blue jeans.  What the hell is in her Starbucks, man?  Oh, my God.  You guys have been waiting 20 years.  No, listen.  The craziest thing is is that you're not too far.  What did you have to?  You actually like fled?  Are you one of those people that had to go into a wall?  My mom had to meet with KGB members.  Really?  Literally like three times before she married my dad. 
[02:26:00]  And she had to get interviewed like, so why are you marrying a foreigner?  Wow.  And foreigner, he's Yugoslavian.  Like Americans don't even think of that as a different nationality.  Do you know what I mean?  But in Russia, she had to get interviewed.  And then, but the person was really cool because he had a daughter my mom's age.  And he would have wanted her to do the same thing.  Yeah.  That kind of thing.  So, he was sort of, you know, just going by the page.  A cool KGB agent.  But he let her go.  Yeah.  Never heard of those. 
[02:26:30]  Wow.  I know, right?  That's like a movie right there.  Never saw that in the movie.  The cool KGB agent.  Ah, you can go.  I don't know.  I saw you swallow some microfilm, but pluck that chicken.  You'll go.  You're losing her mind.  I love this girl.  She's all right, man.  She's all right.  Look at that.  Check her coffee.  I'm telling you, something's in that coffee.  Oh, my God.  I can't take it.  All this racist humor.  Oh, racist humor.  Hey, where's Danny?  Danny's totally putting down my country. 
[02:27:00]  We got a...  No.  It's so funny.  I can't...  No.  It's true, though.  It's so awful.  One of our guys is a huge fan of yours.  One.  What is that noise?  Silence.  Where is he?  Did you hear that noise?  What the hell is that?  Well, he's coming to ask you a question.  Yeah, he's going to be all nervous and everything.  Probably all sweaty.  Ew.  Nice.  I can't wait to meet him.  Hi, Danny.  Sounds great.  This is Danny.  There you go, Danny.  Hi, Danny.  Hello.  I heard Nathaniel sold me down the river. 
[02:27:30]  Nathaniel sold me out today.  Why don't you tell her about you and your mom?  No.  Oh, I don't think we're going to do that today.  No.  Danny likes to drink with his mom and then, I don't know, then say stuff maybe he shouldn't  be seeing.  Inappropriate stuff on camera.  It was really...  Yeah.  So you're a big fan?  I am a huge fan.  Absolutely.  Favorite movie?  Probably...  Got to be Fifth Element.  Yeah.  Got to be Fifth Element.  That one is really good.  And you have a question?  I do.  Do you?  Go ahead.  Conduct an interview.  Something about the fake language? 
[02:28:00]  Well, I heard that in the Fifth Element, that fake language got so intense.  That you could actually hold a conversation with the director.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Well, the director and I, like, would it be able to, like, write back and forth?  Like, you know, I'd be able to ask him questions, like, in the language.  And if I was missing a word, I'd just, like, give him a list of vocabulary that I needed  for my next letter.  That's insane.  And he would sort of give it back to me.  And I would incorporate it, sort of try to incorporate it into my everyday life.  That's almost as geeky as people speaking Klingon. 
[02:28:30]  Listen, I know.  It's true.  It's true.  I get pretty geeky when it comes to, like, research and getting prepared for things.  I love it.  I love reading and being on the computer.  You know, my really amazing, like, night for me is, like, you know, putting music on  the computer for hours.  Oh, is that what you do?  We're like, yeah.  Have fun.  Like, I had such a great time.  I was like, all this jams on my computer. 
[02:29:00]  That's a pretty tough thing to do with your computer.  No, no, no.  With GarageBand, it's awesome.  Yeah.  Oh, okay.  All right.  Oh, you got the Mac?  Well, yeah, definitely.  And I have Logic.  All the artistic people have Macs.  What?  Do you have an IBM?  I have both.  Oh, that's cool.  I'm divided.  Well, I got to play games.  You know, I got to play my games.  So you need a Windows computer to play the games and stuff.  Yeah, I heard that.  You ever play some of the video games?  You like that?  Well, you know, I'm not...  Play yourself in one of them?  No, not yet. 
[02:29:30]  Not yet.  They still have to come out with the Alice video game.  But, you know, my brother really loves, like, all the violent video games.  I'm more of a strategic...  Who doesn't?  Oh, you like the strategy game?  Yeah.  I like the strategy.  So I would, like, build up the towns and the reserves, and then he would go out and conquer  it.  Oh, yeah.  So I'd just be, like, the administrative part, and he would be, like, get the glory.  Right, right.  He spends all the hours building up the army.  At those games where you got to build up a civilization.  Yeah, I love that.  And some people are good at building the civilization and keeping the economy going and keeping 
[02:30:00]  the trains running on time.  Well, SimCity, man.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, I've got it under control.  My budget is great.  Do you hate the fires, though, in that?  Like, every two seconds, something's catching on fire.  Well, you've got to create water towers, dude.  Is that what it is?  Well, they don't have water, man.  See, I'm terrible.  No schools for me.  No anything.  I rule with an iron fist.  Everyone gets all pissed.  Unlike us, the old Soviet Union, pretty much, is the way I run things.  And people do the same thing.  They leave.  I've got a barren wasteland, and everybody's going to greener pastures on some other person's 
[02:30:30]  game.  They're on Mila's.  They're going.  No, it's great.  She's a huge movie star.  She's excited when her budget's okay in her video game.  In the video game.  I've got a surplus.  It's like, all these scripts are piling up.  Screw that.  Oh, God.  Don't even say it.  I've got to feed my people.  It's so true.  I've got to feed them.  Don't even.  Oh, really?  It's shirking your responsibility?  Well, a bit.  It's been kind of crazy busy and stuff.  So sometimes, you know, I'll just go into the sim world.  Let's say hi to Lisa.  It's a perfect world. 
[02:31:00]  Lisa, what's up?  Hi.  Good morning, my friend.  Oh, my God.  Hi, Lisa.  I'm so sorry for making a fool of myself.  Judy.  Hi, Jimmy.  Well, I didn't hear you said hi, Susan.  How are you?  It's Mila.  Listen, I wanted to say, Mila, I love you so much in The Fifth Element.  Thank you.  I'm so obsessed with the movie.  I even have the tattoo.  Wow.  Wow.  Yeah, I love it.  It's beautiful.  It looks really good, actually.  Cool.  Thank you.  Thanks, guys.  Let's say hi to Brian in Nevada.  Brian, what's up?  Hey, Hope.  Hi, Brian. 
[02:31:30]  Mila, I love your movies.  Thank you.  I particularly loved you in The Messenger.  Thank you.  I thought you just were extremely good at that.  Is there going to be any more Resident movies coming out?  Well, we start filming number three in May, so.  Oh, I think you're just awesome, and you managed to pull off every single character you  portrayed.  Oh, thank you so much, Brian.  Thank you.  Okay, and Ant, please unban Tugboat Bride. 
[02:32:00]  He didn't mean to get you on your bad side.  All right, I'll unban him.  All right, we'll deal with that in a little while.  Fuzzy from Whack Bag.  What's up, Fuzzy?  I ban people occasionally from certain sites.  Yo, what's up, boys?  I can't believe I got Leeloo Dallas and my two favorite boys.  Oh, thank you.  Yeah, Leeloo's great, man.  And we're getting along.  This is fun.  We're all getting along.  She seems to be extremely happy to be there with you.  I'm having a great time.  I go right to sixth grade mentality when a pretty girl comes in.  I sit there, and I keep my head down. 
[02:32:30]  Yeah, yeah.  I get all that, but you're very fun.  Sixth grade, too.  I know.  I'm like, what's up?  Yeah.  You're sixth grade, too.  Isn't it great to be immature?  We're doing great.  I'm ready to look at her and ask what kind of ice cream she likes.  We finally admitted it, too, because we had so many hot girls coming through here, and  we just can't talk to the hot ones.  Really?  What do you guys do?  It's so awkward.  But as soon as we finally admitted it to all our listeners, it's gotten a lot easier.  We hear multiple pounding on you. 
[02:33:00]  Oh, bye, Christina.  What's your motivation?  Let's go to...  All right, Fuzzy, you got a question?  Yeah, I just wanted to let her know that.  We only got a couple more minutes with her.  My wife and I absolutely adore her.  Oh, thank you.  She's just beautiful, elegant.  I'm all about you.  Just want to let you know.  We're going to name our first girl after you.  You're the best.  Wow, thank you.  Thank you so much.  Don't take this interview as an example of my normal sophistication levels. 
[02:33:30]  You're multifaceted.  Hey, you got a question, though, Fuzzy, or no?  No, I'm all set.  I love you.  Oh, thank you, Fuzzy.  Thanks, guys.  I think we have time for one more call, and we've got to let her go.  Kent, what's up?  Hey, what's up, Mila?  What's up, Kent?  How's it going?  Good, thank you.  Wow, that guy totally took my question about Resident Evil.  But I'm wondering, who's attached to direct?  This guy named Peter Mahoney.  Okay, cool, cool.  And he's really wonderful.  He's a British director, and he's really great. 
[02:34:00]  He's going to do a good job, and Paul Anderson's going to be producing it, too.  Those movies end really well for sequels, by the way.  When that first one ended, and you just come out in the street, and everything is just...  Well, it's cool, because...  Destroyed.  You know, the world in the video game doesn't really end.  It just keeps going.  Yeah, yeah.  So it's like every movie gets harder and harder, like a video game.  You must have to work out a bit before those rolls, because it seems like you really get  your ass kicked.  Well, yeah, you know, I definitely train a lot for these kind of movies. 
[02:34:30]  Sim training or real training?  Well, unfortunately, wouldn't that be great if my sim could do it for me?  That would be so wonderful.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony, featuring Travis.  Make it like it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony.  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony show.  Hey, I really hope that this is the right bit. 
[02:35:00]  Nice.  Because I picked it based on its name and what I think it is.  I did that once.  Yes.  This is bear hunting in New Jersey.  Yeah, where they go bear hunting in Jersey.  Yes.  You're taking the right bit.  Am I?  Mm-hmm.  Okay, good.  Here it comes.  I'm trying to thought.  Yeah, perfect.  All right.  Do you want to tag it?  Worst of Opie and Anthony.  Travis edition. 
[02:35:30]  Sure is.  It reeks of it.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  I want to make sure Steve is safe this hunting season.  Oh?  I kind of hoped I could get out of the studio before this segment started.  Has there been a problem?  Well, they've got a bear problem in New Jersey, and Steve happens to live in New Jersey.  Oh, Jersey.  I live in Jersey.  That's right.  That's in Jersey.  Every once in a while, they allow the hunters to just start shooting bears in the fine state  of New Jersey.  Doesn't matter where that bear may be. 
[02:36:00]  It could be in your backyard.  They don't give a fuck.  As long as they thin the herd a little bit.  You're right, Bill.  Well, the bears in Jersey do wander in the backyard.  They do.  When a lot of bears are found in people's pools.  Happen on the Sopranos.  Right.  Mm-hmm.  Coming in the backyard and swimming in the pool.  So they want to thin the herd a little bit.  They want to take about 400 bears out, I think.  Something like that.  When the animal rights people come up, and they get all pissed off, they just don't want  people killing the bears.  And then the hunters want to hunt bears because it's fun for them.  Right.  And then the people that live in areas that have bears want them hunted because you don't 
[02:36:30]  want your little puggle to get eaten.  Of course.  At night when you put the little cute guy out back.  It's a boxer.  Well, yeah.  It's one thing to want the actual, you know, to not want to hurt the bears, but it's another  thing when a 500, 600-pound bear is staring you down in your backyard because it just happened  to wander in there.  Is that going to happen in your neighborhood, though?  No.  It happens in neighborhoods where people want to be in the woods by themselves, and then  they're annoyed because they're actually living with wildlife.  There's too many people, anyways.  Well, it happens in the suburbs in Jersey.  I mean, not necessarily where I live because that's pretty close. 
[02:37:00]  It wasn't the suburbs when they started building, my friend.  It was bear territory, urban sprawl.  It was bear territory.  Urban sprawl.  And I think it's time the bears took their fucking land back.  Right.  Apparently that's what they're doing.  Good.  They, I like how he says they, Steve.  They're taking all our jobs.  They want to take the grizzly bear off the endangered species list, too.  The grizzly?  The grizzly bear.  That's on there?  Yeah, because in, like, the Yellowstone National Park area alone, there was, like, 
[02:37:30]  in 1976, they were down to, like, 300 bears, and now it's up to over 600, so they feel  like they've made a huge comeback, and they don't need to be on the endangered species list.  They've only increased by, like, something like that.  It was on 100%.  It was on Yahoo, if you could find the story there.  And that's enough?  That's enough.  That's enough bears for, yeah.  That's enough bears for the one square foot of forest we still have left in this country.  That doesn't seem like enough bears for Yellowstone.  Ramon. 
[02:38:00]  We, as humans, we are so pompous.  There's billions of us.  But the grizzly bears in that area, that's up to 600.  Good enough.  Occasionally, the animals try to...  We don't need to protect them anymore.  ...try to cull our herd.  Yeah.  Makes entertaining news.  That's hilarious.  If some aliens came down and took over, what herd do you think they'd be thinning first?  Oh, please.  They could be us.  They'd be gone.  At least the Chinese would go first, because there's so many of them that they would...  The aliens would be like...  Yeah, they're like mosquitoes.  Yeah.  You got it.  Aliens trying to shoo the Chinese away. 
[02:38:30]  They'd be dead, like, really quickly.  They'd just, you know, hunting season open.  Big mosquito truck.  They'd just spray in the shit out.  We really do need some type of alien invasion to kind of unite us and get rid of some of  us all at the same time.  So whoever's left, I like the real strong ones, real good ones, and the ones that'll  be united in fighting the aliens.  Yeah.  It was the Aryans.  I didn't have a ball to do that.  The perfect race will be left. 
[02:39:00]  We'll have a weaker, weaker...  No, Anthony, you really ought to trim that goatee a little more.  Yeah, no shit.  Get a little long of a side.  A little long of a side.  Here's the story.  Once again, New Jersey has declared open season on black bears.  The state has announced its second bear hunt in 35 years.  The six-day hunt in northern New Jersey will begin on December 5th.  It's designed to control the growing bear population.  Opponents of the hunt say there are better ways to control the number of bears without 
[02:39:30]  killing them.  Yes, of course.  That's a fight they have every couple of years in Jersey.  Do we have audio of the hunters going out and shooting at the bears?  Oh, I don't want to hear that.  Someone sent me a video clip.  It might have actually been Buffalo Paul of a bear that got itself up in a tree in  Jersey.  And what they did was they put a trampoline underneath the tree that the bear had crawled  up and then shot it with tranquilizers until the bear fell out of the tree and bounced  off the trampoline.  Aw, see, they were helping them.  They're trying to be nice.  Helping the little guy relocate him. 
[02:40:00]  Oh!  This is audio of the bear hunt?  Oh, I think they'll get the guy. 
[02:40:30]  This sounds harrowing.  Must have been very nerve-riding.  Is this all in fast motion?  You can't take that hunting.  I think they call it foul.  Oh, and I tell you, rock!  What's Poe doing there? 
[02:41:00]  Oh, and I tell you, rock!  Wow, the chase was on.  It certainly was.  Glad to see you're okayed.  They missed a bulletproof glass on my high-pitched.  Obi and Anthony.

[02:42:30]  It's the worst of the Opie and Anthony Show.  I hope I pick the right bit here.  Because it sounds like a good one.  But it happens so often that I don't know whether or not this is the one I'm looking for.  It's titled Black Girl Fucks Up.  Well, either way, this is probably a good one.  Well, this is a three-parter.  And I think it jumps into some Ron and Fez airtime, too.  Well, good.  I believe this is when Black Earl messed up the Grammy recording that we had in the office. 
[02:43:00]  I think that's exactly the bit you're talking about.  Yes.  And this is part one of Black Earl Fucks Up on the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Listen for the lies.  It's the worst.  The worst.  The worst.  Of Opie and Anthony.  Oh, we got drama today. 
[02:43:30]  Drama, drama, drama, drama.  We're trying to get Black Earl on the phone.  That's funny.  You're listening to three guys that are very annoyed today.  Very annoyed.  Our buddy Club Soda Kenny's in trouble.  Just Google our names, Opie and Anthony, and you'll get the article from the New Jersey Star-Ledger.  We just talked about that for an hour.  We'll talk about it again.  And then we want to go into some Grammy stuff.  And we record stuff every night in our office. 
[02:44:00]  We have TVs all over the joint.  Yep.  And Black Earl, who doesn't like going home, is on the phone.  Earl.  Yo.  What's going on, buddy?  What's happening?  Did you watch the Grammys?  Bits and pieces.  Why bits and pieces?  Um, kind of boring.  Were you changing the channels a lot?  No.  Where did you watch the Grammys?  Um, we were working on some stuff, and we watched part of it when we could in the producer's studio. 
[02:44:30]  Also known as our big office?  No, the producer's room next door to the studio.  Earl, everyone crowded into that tiny room to watch the Grammys?  Instead of on the nice couches in our big office with a huge flat screen?  Big flat screen plasma TV?  Oh.  It was just like, uh...  Earl, let's ask straight out.  Was anybody from your staff in the Opie and Anthony office at any time last night? 
[02:45:00]  Um, no.  No.  I mean, outside of...  We were working on a couple of production pieces, but we didn't touch the television.  Look, look, look, look.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Maybe you didn't hear the question.  Wait, you were in our office working on production pieces?  Yeah.  Maybe you didn't hear the question.  Why are they in our office at all?  That's what I asked.  Earl, was anyone in the office last night?  Outside of us?  No. 
[02:45:30]  No.  No!  Earl, Earl.  Was any of your staff in our office?  I'm asking if any of the staff was inside our office.  I want a yes or a no.  Yes.  Okay.  You were working on...  Yes.  Who?  You were working on who was in the office.  Name everybody.  Ben, come in here, please.  Who was in the office?  Earl?  Yes.  Who was in the office? 
[02:46:00]  Well, it was me and someone we can't name yet because the paperwork hasn't been done  yet.  Why are you guys in our office?  Because some of the audio we can't access, we can only load it through your computer.  Ben, everyone is completely aware of it.  Uh-huh.  But someone was in the office and this is the problem.  They changed the channel and they fucked us up bad today. 
[02:46:30]  We have no audio because one of your guys was changing the channel.  There's been emails and notes posted everywhere saying, don't fucking change the channel.  The channel on the big screen TV cannot be changed because the remote not only changes  that, it changes every one of the boxes on there that are recording separate channels  and all of a sudden we have nothing that we were recording the night before.  Now, I've seen on three different occasions the same emails go out because this has happened 
[02:47:00]  before.  And your staff is supposed to be completely aware of this.  I've gotten emails where it says your staff is completely aware of this.  And yet again, it happened.  What is Danny showing me?  Danny's got some type of evidence.  Danny, what is that?  Well, basically I wanted to see what was going on on the PC last night so I just did a search  for last modified files and everything that's coming up is Ron and Fez production between 
[02:47:30]  the hours of 8 and 11.  8 and 11 at night.  So not only was someone in the office, they were in there from 8 o'clock till 11 o'clock.  For three hours.  I was working on Eric's computer.  We were there pretty late.  So you're telling me that, no, so what they did was, you watched part of the Grammys, not  all of them, but they didn't watch them on the computers and the TVs in the office,  the big flat screen.  They ran in to this little shitty peep booth and watched them here next to the studio.  That's what we're supposed to believe.  Even though you were in our office for three straight hours doing Ron and Fez production. 
[02:48:00]  He wouldn't, you guys are fucking lying.  You're lying.  Earl, you are lying now.  Why would you watch the Grammys in this tiny little studio when you were in our huge office  with a huge flat screen?  For the entire Grammy broadcast.  For the entire, what?  I will tell you the segment that we happened to catch.  I don't give a shit what you watched of the Grammys.  The fact is you watched it in our office and someone changed the channel on the TV and  they fucked us bad today.  Was the channel changed on the TV during the time you were in there for three hours? 
[02:48:30]  Um, I don't know.  I don't, God.  Yes, you do know.  Just answer.  You do know.  You know, for the sake of guilt, yes.  Who changed the channel?  It was probably me.  Now, weren't you told, Earl, in three different times that that channel is not to be changed  because it interferes with the other boxes?  I fucked up.  I'm sorry.  You fucked up?  What?  Again?  This is the third time that I can count. 
[02:49:00]  And I pay no attention to what goes on in this fucking place.  Third time.  Third time.  Third time.  Third times were, but this time, for the sake of everything, I did it.  Well, one time is...  I didn't do it.  Earl, one time is too many.  We're a very popular talk show that broadcasts in two fucking countries and you're sitting  there with the remote fucking us up.  Oh, God.  We love Ron and Fez, but you guys are ridiculous behind the scenes.  You cost us a lot of fucking audio today. 
[02:49:30]  How about you help the show and you sing all the performances because we don't have them.  Do your impression of Bono because we really need it now.  Yeah.  What did you see?  I didn't even see...  You know what I saw?  We saw the...  I don't care what you saw.  We care that you changed the channel when people have told you, don't change the channel  because it fucks up our recordings.  And then you denied it.  Yeah.  And then you denied it and said you watched it in another office.  You lied.  And then I asked you if anyone was in the office and your first response to that was no. 
[02:50:00]  And then it turns out that...  We were working on production all night last night.  I don't give a shit.  But when you were initially asked, you said no, which was a lie.  You lied.  And now, what, E-Rock, you got something?  No, you said did anyone touch the office?  No, we said we were in the office and you said no.  I just asked if anyone was in the office at all and at first you said no.  We were on production last night.  Right.  E-Rock, what do you got?  Earl, didn't you call me last night in a panic around 7.35 asking how to reset the television 
[02:50:30]  recording program on the computer?  And did I not walk you through it saying, do you see this?  Do you see that?  Are you watching TV?  Yes, you were watching TV.  Is everything back online?  Yes.  And what did I tell you?  I said, is everything set now?  Was the television set on the monitor?  And why did you get in that situation to begin with?  Yeah, you knew you fucked up then.  Because instead of minimizing it, I hit the other button by accident.  He disconnected the actual, he turned the program off that is set to record the television. 
[02:51:00]  I walked through him with it.  And you told me everything was fucked.  Earl, you were in the office.  I'm asking you to tell me what was on the screen.  I'm like, do you see this?  Yes.  Do these little red dots showing up?  Yes.  So you're watching TV.  The program's back on.  It's recording.  Yes.  Okay, I'm going back to sleep.  I'll talk to you later.  Okay, Earl, bye.  I can't believe I'm saying this today, but I love E-Rock.  E-Rock's full of piss and vinegar.  Come on, E-Rock.  Well, you're not going to...  Come on, baby!  If it's technical shit, there's no way Eric is wrong and Earl is right.  No way.  Come on, baby. 
[02:51:30]  Than's got something?  Than?  Well, I think it even was fixed because we have the first glorious eight minutes of the Grammys.  So it may have gotten fixed and then fucked up eight minutes later.  Exactly.  So we can play Madonna, you know, trying to look like Farrah Fawcett in a leotard.  Yes.  That's our Grammy coverage.  So Earl may have actually fixed it and then completely fucked it up again.  By turning it off.  Eight minutes later by changing the channel or something else. 
[02:52:00]  Yeah.  Why are these guys allowed in our office?  That's what I need to know.  Because...  I love Ron and Fez.  They do an unbelievable show.  I listen every day.  But I got to tell you, their people behind the scenes are incompetent and have no business  being in our office where the big boys play.  Whoa, wait.  Get the fucking guys a little Commodore computer and, you know, let them hang out somewhere  else.  You guys don't deserve to be in our office.  How else?  Don't deserve. 
[02:52:30]  They don't!  They don't!  They don't have anything done.  Because of shit like this, you do stuff that you've been told not to do with the TV  and you fucked us.  You cost us audio.  A lot of it.  You don't understand, though.  I do understand.  You cost us audio and lied about it.  What?  There you go.  Yeah, jump up and down on luggage.  Great.  Way to go.  Way to go.  Way to go, Earl.  Stop sulking.  You fucked up.  Who put the grilled cheese sandwich in the VCR? 
[02:53:00]  Which one of the infants that work for Ron and Fez did that?  What'd you break, Earl, this time?  And he hung up.  Earl?  He just jumped up and down like a lunatic.  You know, let me tell you something.  No fucking cares.  For anybody that listens.  Sorry, go ahead.  For anyone that listens to the Ron and Fez show and hears Earl bantering with Ron and Fez,  that's the new Earl, by the way.  That is the new Earl.  We don't know that Earl.  The Earl you just heard is the Earl we have known for six, seven years, has it been? 
[02:53:30]  I don't even know at this point, but that is the Earl we know, that is the Earl we have  had contact with for seven fucking years.  He just had a flashback.  He had a flashback.  What he did was he took the receiver of his phone and smashed it.  That's the sound you were hearing.  He was smashing it on the table.  It either broke or after that he hung up.  Oh, he definitely broke his phone.  He broke his phone.  And the anger that came out in that was directed at no one but himself. 
[02:54:00]  Because he knows he fucked up.  I got to communicate to Don Wicklund.  We don't want them in our office.  You guys got to get, but don't want their people in our office.  You've got to wire their office with a computer that the production, whatever they need, can  be done.  Can't be trusted.  We've had emails.  We've had notes posted.  We've told people personally.  And still, our recordings get fucked up.  And this is a huge day where we really needed the TVs because we wanted to play some of the  shit from the Grammys last night.  It's the Grammys. 
[02:54:30]  Yeah.  They need their own stuff.  Whatever they need.  To record whatever they need to record, they need in their office so that the infants  don't come in and just fuck up our office.  I didn't lie about it.  By the way, I've been like, I've been good guy.  I haven't even brought up the fact that there's surprises on my desk every morning when I walk  in.  I don't know who's putting shit there.  You know, just cups of water and things like are on there. 
[02:55:00]  My computer's fucked up somehow.  But, you know, I'm one of those guys.  I can click, click, click and fix a lot of stuff right away.  I notice programs are downloaded on my computer.  And this is, that computer in the office is a person.  It's my computer.  It's not an office computer.  It's not a production computer.  My fucking computer.  And I notice programs.  Pictures are downloaded onto the desktop from somewhere.  I have no clue.  There's big lines of history on websites that I have no idea who they are, what they are, 
[02:55:30]  what they're using them for.  That, that's still happening, by the way.  But I don't even, I don't even, I haven't mentioned that because I just deal with it.  Make no mistake, we have no problems with Ron and Fez.  I love Ron and Fez.  It's these dopes that work for them.  I don't know how they keep the show working with the incompetent buffoons that they have  behind the scenes.  How that ship, the SS Ron and Fez, stays afloat with a blind crew running it is beyond me. 
[02:56:00]  It is a tribute to their own talent that they actually put on an entertaining program on  a daily basis with, with retarded children running their show.  And you guys laugh at me.  They don't deserve to hang in our office.  No.  The staff?  No.  They don't deserve it.  Because they sit around like, oh, wow, look, this is cool.  Let me see what's on TV.  Let me fuck with this.  Believe me, 24 hours a day when we're not even here, shit is going on in that office that  is helping our show.  There is automated stuff. 
[02:56:30]  It's the year 2001.  Make believe there are robots in there.  It's the 21st century.  Excuse me.  It's the 21st century.  Make believe there are robots walking around doing work.  Because that's exactly what is really happening.  It's automated.  Things are working.  Even when we're not there.  Can't you keep your pal talk camera on?  It's on right now so people can check out our office.  Office cam will now remain on all the time.  Office cam all the time.  Log on. 
[02:57:00]  You can log on at home.  We will keep that room open.  We want you to rat out whoever the fuck gets screen caps.  Everyone is a cop for the O&A show right now.  All you pests, new mission.  Monitor office cam.  And rat out whoever's in there.  You all get deputy badges.  You're deputies now.  You all get deputy badges.  I want screen caps and dossiers of everyone that walks in that place.  Someone make a deputy badge and start handing it out.  And we will hook up a gun to the camera and you will be able to shoot whoever you see in there. 
[02:57:30]  That's right.  Earl.  Yes.  How's your phone?  What'd you break?  Everything.  Well, stop breaking stuff.  What, you prefer me hitting somebody?  Oh, who are you going to hit?  Yourself.  Yeah, could you just punch yourself in the head?  Could you do a fight club scene for us and throw yourself through a bookshelf?  I'm hearing good things about you.  I'm hearing that you changed your act and you're doing terrific things for Ron and Fez, okay?  But shut up.  As the boss of the Ron and Fez show, you've got to get your people in line. 
[02:58:00]  You know what?  Get your people in line.  The crew work very hard.  They...  I don't care if they work very hard.  They're fucking up our show.  Do you get it, Earl?  No.  There's a problem.  I don't want to take responsibility.  And as the boss, you have to take care of it.  You don't want to take responsibility?  Then who did it?  No, I said I will take responsibility for that.  Uh-huh.  I said I will take complete responsibility for that.  But don't knock my fucking crew.  Your crew is a bunch of retards.  Don't mock your crew.  There's new people on your crew every day. 
[02:58:30]  Exactly.  They're retards.  I'm mocking them.  I couldn't even name them.  And Ron and Fez have been here almost a year already.  Yeah.  Your crew?  Your crew?  I've been working with the same guys for, fuck, eight years.  There was fucking video of your crew playing tag football before the Super Bowl in a park.  But as I was...  Earl, you understand the situation.  As the boss, you've got to make sure that you or no one from your staff fucks with our office when we're not here.  Simple.  It's also my responsibility that work has to get done, right? 
[02:59:00]  Yeah, but who...  It's only room work capable of getting it done.  It's not about the work.  It's about who turned the channel when there were signs all over and everybody was told not to turn the channel.  It's not about the computers.  Earl, Earl, let me...  Right.  Right.  Let me tell you something else, Earl.  Let me tell you something else as far as you being in a supervisor capacity here.  You know what happened when we came in here?  We didn't really have a lot of the shit we needed.  Somebody took the bull by the horns, if I can say that. 
[02:59:30]  Jimmy, can I?  I'm afraid you didn't, but it's already out.  All right.  Took the bull by the horns and went to management and we fucking didn't leave them alone until we had the equipment we needed to put on the program we need to.  Not walking around looking for someone else's shit so we can do our stuff.  You need to get your shit together, go to Wickland, go to ELO, and demand that you get the equipment you guys need to put on a show.  You don't think we haven't asked that?  Not good enough. 
[03:00:00]  You don't think...  I mean, this is not enough because you guys have been...  I want to say this very quickly.  Watch us do your favor.  Right now, we'll do your favor.  Wickland, get them the fucking shit they need so they're out of our office.  We need it by the end of the fucking week, which is tomorrow.  Get them the shit they need so they no longer have to use our office.  Do it immediately.  Because they can't be trusted.  Because they can't be trusted.  Problem solved.  Who turned the channel, Earl?  Was it you or are you covering for somebody?  I'm sorry? 
[03:00:30]  Did you turn the channel or are you covering for somebody?  No, I'm not covering for anyone.  I'll take the responsibility for it.  Did you do it?  Did you do it?  I don't remember.  I woke up 15 minutes ago.  I'm freaking out.  Oh, boy, you did it, didn't you?  I don't know what I did last night.  Oh, boy.  Oh, boy.  It really, it cost us Grammys audio today.  There's a lot of moving boxes around the joint today.  Maybe a few of those boxes should have Earl's name on them.  Oh, boy, Earl.  Maybe it should.  Maybe it should. 
[03:01:00]  Every show in the country is talking about the Grammys except for us because we don't have the audio.  Because you might have or might have not changed the channel.  I was working on a computer last night.  So what?  I don't care.  So stay off the TV.  Don't work on the computer.  Big deal.  All kidding aside, Don Wicklund, you've got to take care of this because we've had it.  We can't have guys changing the channel and fucking up all our recordings.  I don't have to get to stream that at 8.15 in the morning.  Hey, Earl.  Thanks.  Hey, it's Lily.  Run at Fez noon to 3. 
[03:01:30]  You're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony.  As I'm coming up, I run into Anthony.  I run into Ben.  Everybody is telling me that this place was a madhouse before I got here this morning.  Yeah.  I got in probably about 10 minutes ago and got the same madhouse feeling where everybody's  trying to tell me a story but starting in the middle or at the end.  Right.  And I finally had to say, if someone doesn't tell me what's going on in the next two seconds,  I'm going to blow a gasket. 
[03:02:00]  I'm going to go just the opposite because I see Earl standing up and he looks like angry  Earl and it looks like he's upset, Fezzy.  So maybe that's not the exact way to go with this.  Maybe I don't even want to hear the story.  Do I not even want to hear the story, Earl?  No, you don't.  It's that bad?  No, I have nothing to say about this.  Our intern, Bronx Johnny, said to me, I'm breaking up.  Everything's fine.  I don't know what happened. 
[03:02:30]  Earl, you tell me.  I don't even want to know.  I shouldn't even look into this.  It's not even worth discussing on either.  Yeah.  Not at all.  And I'm trying to stay calm.  I really am.  Yeah.  Well, throwing boxes isn't going to help that.  You could put an eye out.  Oh, some of those boxes.  They have sharp corners.  Yes, that's right.  And Fez has diabetes, so he needs his eyesight.  You should see my phone and my bathroom door.  Everything's going crazy at your house.  Shit all over it? 
[03:03:00]  No, I think I knocked it off a team.  Here's the thing.  Don't wipe your ass with your phone or your bathroom door.  Wow, that shouldn't even have to be said.  Hey, well, it is going to be said.  It is going to be said until everybody understands it.  Adam, you're on Rona Fez.  Hey, guys.  Earl, I am so disappointed in you.  You took a real ass whipping on there this morning and did not handle yourself like a black man at all.  You just got flustered and beat the hell out of your phone. 
[03:03:30]  I ain't even afraid of black men anymore now.  All right, well, you can't compare Earl with most.  And you have to remember that ONA and Earl have this long history that they go back a long way where it's kind of a, I don't want to say love-hate.  But it's love, and then there's a taunting and teasing and something that happens that sends Earl into the spiral.  Like a tough love?  Yeah, it could be a tough love, but the tough love should work to make the guy tougher, not go into a whole downward place. 
[03:04:00]  Well, it was a situation where they kept asking me questions, and every time I tried to answer it, one of them would start screaming at me.  So I just got flustered and I threw the phone across the hall.  And broke it?  I didn't break it.  The door is another story.  Yeah.  I just got, I was like, why am I talking if they're not going to let me get a word in?  You know your own history.  You know this, Earl.  You were Annie W. Earl.  No, I just, you know, and I was running.  I just couldn't deal with it this morning. 
[03:04:30]  You can never deal with it.  That's something that has gone on as long as we've known the three of you guys.  That's what I heard when I walked in.  That was the first thing I heard out of the O&A office.  Yeah.  Annie W. Earl is back.  Who said that?  I think Opie said that.  Yeah.  Opie said it.  It was the first one I heard.  Then a lot of people chimed in as well.  Earl, just getting in your kitchen.  It's just not a way to start a day.  I know.  And your bathroom.  But you know the gimmick. 
[03:05:00]  You've been up on the hill before, refusing to ski.  We could go through every single story.  You wouldn't touch the cotton.  It's a long thing that you have.  Sounds crazy in hindsight.  Yeah.  This is what it's all about, Earl.  That's your relationship.  Here's Hollywood.  And I haven't heard none of it.  I have no idea what started it or how we got to this point.  Other than the fact that a young intern had to go picking up a bunch of boxes today. 
[03:05:30]  And Bronx Johnny?  You couldn't get any better than that, Fezzy.  Bronx Johnny is the man.  He's right there.  Yeah.  He was the oasis of calm.  Were those Emma's boxes?  Her moving boxes?  Oh, no.  That box says Earl across it.  Oh.  Like Earl's stuff has been loaded up for him to leave the building.  Oh.  Oh, is that right?  That's why that box got thrown.  The details will trickle in as we go. 
[03:06:00]  I've got to start listening.  I've got to start listening.  I've got to get one of these satellite radios.  I hear everybody talking about.  Here's Jesse.  Jesse, you're on run of Fez.  Hey, Jesse.  Hey, how's it going?  Yeah.  Earl didn't deserve that.  I thought he handled himself very well this morning.  By what?  Breaking phones and throwing boxes?  No, that was off the air.  On the air, I thought he handled himself very well.  Earl, did you feel like you handled yourself very well?  And again, I don't know what happened.  I stood up for my guys. 
[03:06:30]  That's all I'm going to say.  Okay.  Again, I really do not want to talk about this.  Okay.  All right.  Here's Ken.  Ken, you're on run of Fez.  Hey, I disagree with the last caller.  He got everything he deserved because at the start of the phone call, he just wouldn't tell the truth.  He tried to hem and haw and get around the subject and wouldn't just own up to responsibility, and he got what he deserved.  Is that right, Earl? 
[03:07:00]  What?  Own up?  Is that statement true?  What's happening?  No, they asked me what we were doing last night.  We were working on production last night.  Right.  That's the truth.  How is that hemming and haw?  That's not right.  How is that hemming and haw?  What they asked was, was anybody in our office?  Yes.  And his answer was no.  No, I said, we were working on production.  That's what I said.  You told them you were working on production.  We were working on production.  The only place, the one place we work on production is the bullpen.  You finally said you were in their office.  I said, we were working on the bullpen on production.  I wish I had heard this. 
[03:07:30]  You should have just answered the question, yes or no, like they asked it.  You wouldn't have had all that world of shit.  I thought I did answer the question.  They were trying to, whatever they were trying to bait me into, I just would not go into it.  I was like, you know what?  We were working on production last night.  That's the truth.  What were you working on?  Production.  Yeah.  You're all upset like that crazy Bible lady.  You know, when you had your Bible with you yesterday, there's something about the Bible believers that are just, their anger is right there all the time. 
[03:08:00]  I had it just to match her quotes when she was just quoting stuff out of the air.  Can I just bring up one thing?  Hold on.  The Pope is on fire.  Yeah.  The Pope.  The Pope is on fire.  He don't get no water.  Let that heretic burn.  First he was a liar. 
[03:08:30]  Now he's on fire.  He don't get no water.  Let that heretic burn.  Did they win Best New Artist last night?  They should have.  They remind me of the Roaches.  I don't know if that goes back a little too far.  All right.  So it looks like our show, Fuzzy, that there's tension.  There's a lingering tension with Earl.  You have reverted to the little child in the family that, now what's going to happen? 
[03:09:00]  What's going to happen?  That brings back your old stuff.  Oh, totally.  I remember there would be one night a week, because my dad worked nights and my mom was home during the day, and so they never really saw each other.  And so any time a fight would break out would be Sunday night.  It would be like the one time they were both at home.  Your favorite TV night.  Exactly.  Sure.  And that's when the fights would break out, and I would just be shaking like a leaf.  I would be a nervous wreck, and what I would do is I'd put on Harper Valley PTA, I'd actually take the album out of the cover, put it on the turntable, and do a funny dance to it where I would shake my ass, trying to get everyone to laugh instead of yelling at each other. 
[03:09:30]  It's so weird how similar you and I are, because I remember when I was a kid, when my parents would start to fight, I would get into the liquor cabinet and then just go through my mom's purse.  Yeah, I never did that.  I never had a drink over it.  Yeah.  So not really all that same. 
[03:10:00]  I meant in a positive way.  Like, now I can finally treat this place like it's my house.  Dylan, Dylan, you're on Rana Fez.  How are you?  Hey, Dylan.  Hey, how's it going?  Good.  I just think that what Opie Anthony did to Earl this morning was wrong.  I think it was unprofessional, and they have access to so many obscure sound bites that I think that they could have came up with something that they got from the Grammys last night.  Not a whole lot of problems. 
[03:10:30]  Well, I don't know what the thing is, but see, here's what you have to remember.  Again, Earl and Opie go way back.  They have this very strange relationship.  Fez and I noticed that when we first met both of them that there was like either thing where like Earl was like fiercely loyal to those guys or he would leave the building for weeks at a time.  And then, you know, I'd be like, well, I guess that's it for Earl.  I guess Earl quit then. 
[03:11:00]  And the next time I would see him, he would be totally tight with him again.  So they have this very dysfunctional thing that goes way back.  And, you know, Opie's the one who, you know, used to call me and said, look, I really think Earl's a new guy and you're really going to like him.  And he couldn't have pushed him anymore to me.  But we knew this kind of stuff was going to happen as well.  It's like best friends and worst enemies all rolled into one.  And it's like they like the drama.  They like the dance.  Does that seem true at all to you, Earl? 
[03:11:30]  Yeah.  Break up the makeup?  I don't like drama.  Period.  I don't like any tension.  In a way you do.  It's that sexual energy that you're looking for that you lack in your personal life.  I do not want to bang Opie.  Thank you very much.  No, I'm not saying that.  I'm saying it's a makeup for the fact that you don't have enough sexual tension.  What?  I got plenty of that tension.  Niagara Falls, that girl?  No.  The Niagara Falls gal?  No, that's Fezzy's fiance.  Oh, yeah, I get mixed up. 
[03:12:00]  When I walked in today, Earl was asking for a nitro tablet.  Were you really?  Here comes Opie.  Hey, Ope.  Ope, look what you left me with.  Hey, guys.  What are you talking about today?  Take a look at what you left me with.  What's wrong with him today?  He's in a pile over there.  He won't even take his black sunglasses off.  It's the late morning, and he's got the sunglasses on.  He's all covered up.  He's furious.  He's throwing stuff. 
[03:12:30]  All right.  I'll admit we might have went a little too far by packing his box with his stuff.  So he's not leaving?  Well, I mean, they're getting rid of the dead weight, and maybe we went a little too far.  He's not even looking at you.  Earl, I got you the gig.  That part's true.  Did I or did I not get you the gig?  So you're saying you could take it away at any time as well?  No, I don't have that power.  I'm not going to be cocky.  I got you the gig, Earl.  No, I just did not appreciate getting a call at 815 in the morning, getting screamed at. 
[03:13:00]  Our whole show is fucked up.  Screamed at.  We count on the audio that we collect overnight.  Why?  And you sat in there, you put your feet up, and you started changing the channels.  That is absolutely, positively not true.  What?  Put our feet up and watch?  Here's what you got to understand.  Put my feet up?  We were walking all last night.  This place is Earl's apartment.  He can't, his own place is not livable. 
[03:13:30]  It's covered with what?  It's like moss in there or something, Earl?  It's the black mold or something, right?  No, we have a mold from the ceiling, and it's just surrounded by CDs.  I'm not going to lie.  Earl is walking around this place at night in a robe, brushing his teeth.  This is where he lives.  Does Earl have mold on his body?  Because he doesn't move too fast.  It's a joke, Earl.  That's not going to help, is it?  No, it's just a joke.  Nothing?  Earl, what is it that you want to say?  Let's doctor fill this situation. 
[03:14:00]  I'm not saying anything.  It's something that you...  I will not say a thing.  It's something you really want to say at this point is going to be wrong.  Look, let's work it out.  Yeah.  This is a safe place.  Let's work it out.  This is a safe place.  All right, so maybe you didn't have your feet up on a desk, but you were changing the channels, right?  No!  He said yes on our show.  I did not...  And then he turned off the program.  Is that true?  Oh, God, no.  That is not true.  Did you call E-Rock and say,  Oh, my God, I think I did something.  We were working on one of the Adobe's in the back, and I went to minimize it, and I accidentally 
[03:14:30]  hit something else.  What show were you watching, Earl?  I was not watching anything.  Girlfriends?  No.  Are you telling me that you say...  So I called E-Rock, and I said, Hey, look, this is what...  And I wasn't in a panic.  I just said, Hey, look, this is what happened.  No, no.  Is this correct?  And I said...  E-Rock was very passionate today for the first time in a long time on our show.  He was yelling and screaming.  Yeah, he had a lot of energy.  And the first thing I said...  And I said, because you know why?  I don't want to screw up the audio for you guys. 
[03:15:00]  Well, you did.  I said, I don't want to do that.  We didn't even talk about the Grammys.  And he walked me through the process, and we corrected the problem.  No, you didn't.  We totally corrected the problem.  I went step by step with him.  I was like, Is this supposed to be there?  Yes.  Is this supposed to be there?  Yes.  So why do we have audio today?  I have no idea.  You're saying my guys are dummies?  I'm not saying that at all.  Who's to blame on that?  And I'll say this again.  The ONA crew has been amazing to this show and to the crew. 
[03:15:30]  To our crew.  They have been great with us.  What do you accept?  Yeah, you're accepting a fucking award up there.  Yeah.  Tonight we have Earl Anu with this.  But all except for E-Rock?  Is that what I'm hearing?  I'm not throwing E-Rock under the bus.  E-Rock helped me out.  Instead of Grammys audio, we had Fox News and SpongeBob.  Thanks to you, Earl.  You know what?  Earl loves SpongeBob.  Fox News was on all night last night.  It was all when we got there.  And also the What's Happening Marathon.  Oh.  Hey, hey, hey.  Hey, hey, hey. 
[03:16:00]  Here's some audio from the ONA show today.  Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?  SpongeBob SquarePants.  All right.  Here comes E-Rock.  E-Rock, what happened with you and Earl?  Earl called me in a frenzy that he thought he shut down our TV recording system.  So I walked him through.  And it seems that it was there.  And we got a whole eight minutes of the Grammys before it got turned off.  Well, Earl, why are you shocked that you're taking the heat from this if you know you're  the one who shut it down somehow?  No, I didn't shut it.  That's what I found out. 
[03:16:30]  I did not shut it down.  E-Rock, is it safe to say that someone changed the channel?  Yes.  For the listeners out there, maybe they don't understand.  If you change the big TV, it screws up everything.  Right, E-Rock?  Yeah.  So someone was sitting in there, grabbed the remote and said, the Grammys are boring.  I want to see what else is on TV.  And that's what screwed up everything for us.  God's honest truth.  And I hate it every second of it.  Fox News was on there when we got in there.  And it was on when we left.  Then.  Yeah, but Fox didn't have the Grammys.  Exactly.  Which means I didn't change it. 
[03:17:00]  But the Grammys were on for the first seven minutes.  We have proof of that.  All right.  Wow.  Your people are running in with communications.  Our people are running in with communiques.  I smell cage match.  All right.  Here's Anthony on the line.  How you doing, Ant?  Hi, guys.  How you doing?  I'm just listening to this.  Earl is getting me in a tizzy.  I'm driving in a tizzy listening to Earl saying that he might be called up that early in the morning 
[03:17:30]  and then trying to be coaxed into something or, like, trying to beat him with questions.  He asked him, were you in our office?  He said, no.  That was a lie.  They blinked a lie.  Earl, were you in there?  I said, we were working in the bullpen on production.  That's what we were.  We were in the office.  The bullpen.  The office.  Earl.  Now, listen to the replay today.  You'll hear it for yourself. 
[03:18:00]  He said he was not in our office.  Oh, wait a minute.  He just left.  He just left.  He said he was watching the Grammys in there.  Where'd he go?  Where's he going?  Oh, I hear yelling.  I hear yelling.  I love yelling.  All right.  He's all running.  Mic it.  Mic it.  Screaming and running.  Mars, take a mic down there if you would.  One of the portable mics.  What is going on?  A lot of screaming and yelling just went on down the hallway.  I don't know if it was Earl or.  Where did he go?  I'm not even kidding.  What happened?  I'm not even going to kid for the radio or anything. 
[03:18:30]  There's 12 guys that just ran after Earl with cell phones.  I'm running down the stairs right now.  Where?  He can't leave.  Eastside Dave?  Hot cart.  All right.  His phone is getting in and out.  Yeah, turn that off.  Because of his madness.  The preliminary report is that he just ran down the stairs.  Then he went to the elevator.  This is his job.  He can't run out of here.  He didn't like hearing the truth. 
[03:19:00]  The truth of the matter was that he was being evasive when being asked a simple question.  He won't accept the fact that we asked him where was he or anyone from the Ron Fess show in our office yesterday.  And he didn't even say it's a yes or no question.  Not we were doing for Dr. Ditch in that fucking question.  And when he gets to the point where he's gotten and someone has him, then he's got to explode and run away from the situation.  It's what he's always done.  Well, someone we got on 58th Street. 
[03:19:30]  He's got to be out there.  There's nowhere else for him to go.  Out the back entrance.  I swear this is so N.E.W.  I used to see him running down the street on my way in.  Remember when we used to come in and you'd see Earl and you'd say, Earl, what are you doing?  Oh, I had to take a few hours to cool off.  A few hours away from his job.  And then he has to get to cool off from what?  And he'd be like, he would have nothing at that point.  I saw him in the village one time.  I swear to God, doing the show.  All right, here's Jimmy Norton.  Jimmy, what's happening out there? 
[03:20:00]  Earl makes me sick.  He lied.  He lied.  He called up.  They said, were you in the office last night?  No.  First thing he said was no.  Listen for yourself on the replay.  He lied.  We don't have to.  He said he wasn't in the office.  He's got nowhere else to go.  It's like getting mad at a homeless guy.  He's got to sleep somewhere.  This place is basically his box.  And now the ONA staff is in master control running our show because our staff just hightailed it down the steps.  They actually are.  They're in there helping you guys out now. 
[03:20:30]  Because they all abandoned ship.  Apparently Ben is running down the street with a cell phone right now.  Ben's got jumped out of a heart attack.  That's great.  Thanks.  Thanks, guys.  They're trying to get him.  Just look out the window.  We should be able to see him go by.  Do we have an XM copter that can follow Earl around from spot to spot?  With traffic.  Have you ever worked anywhere or had any job where a person could run out?  I've never.  I've never had the job that you can leave.  The beauty.  Thank God Earl's not a pilot. 
[03:21:00]  Yeah, it's true.  Earl's back.  All right.  Earl.  There he is.  Okay.  He's back in the building.  All right.  Good.  All right.  Back in master control.  Yeah.  Let's check in with him.  Earl, where'd you go, buddy?  Go ahead.  No, here's the thing, too.  When Earl gets mad, he gets slower.  He's in no hurry now.  All right.  Take your time, Earl.  I'm sorry.  I was highly disrespectful.  All right.  What happened?  Yes, it was.  It was insane is what it was.  All right, Earl.  Because you walked out of the show once. 
[03:21:30]  I have a heart condition.  Oh, yeah.  You did.  I forgot.  What did Anthony say that made you run out of here?  I just don't want to deal with this.  Yeah.  At all.  In my mind, it's already over.  Hey, you only got another two and a half hours.  But Earl, Earl, I'm talking as your friend now.  Not the asshole that does the radio show.  Just admit you were wrong.  The difference?  Sort of.  Slight.  I know them both.  You can't tell the difference.  All right, Ronnie.  Earl.  I think you're worse off there, if I had to be honest.  Earl, admit that you were in there and you changed the channel. 
[03:22:00]  That's all.  I did not change the channel.  We were working in that office.  But I did not change the channel.  You said you were watching a little bits and pieces of the Grammys.  Yes, in this room.  Nobody believes him.  He ran out of that flat screen TV to watch in that little shitty office.  In this room.  No, you're lying.  You're lying.  You know what?  Then don't believe me.  I don't.  Earl.  You're covering for someone or you're lying?  Earl.  You're covering for someone.  I am not.  I will sit.  I am not lying.  With God as my witness, I am not lying. 
[03:22:30]  Earl, take a deep breath and walk us through last night.  Off the air.  Hey, you just turned this all off the air.  He got upset, turned off his mic, and turned everyone's mic off from master control in the  process.  Earl, that wasn't outrageous.  Just take a deep breath and walk us through last night.  That's all I'm asking.  Just tell the truth.  That's all I'm asking.  Which place...  How are we supposed to believe anything he's saying when the first question I was asked 
[03:23:00]  of him, his answer was a lie.  A lie.  No, I'm not believing that he did.  I did not change that channel.  Period.  You said you were in the office when we asked him.  We were in the office.  We were doing production.  We did not change the channel.  So it changed itself.  That sounds too much like Clinton right there.  Did not change the channel.  Earl.  How many times do I have to say it?  We did not change the channel.  Yes, you did.  Look at me.  Oh!  Not that, Mike.  He just body slammed the microphone.  Do not break the XM equipment.  I suppose you didn't do that either, huh, stupid?  From 8 to 11 a.m., you didn't change the channel, what? 
[03:23:30]  Of course they did.  Earl, I watched that shitty show.  I kept turning it on and off all night long.  It was terrible, but then I go, well, maybe something better is on, and I went back.  I understand completely what you went through.  I got an important question for Earl.  Sly, Sly, what did you think?  You never saw him?  Did you see Sly do his thing?  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh. 
[03:24:00]  No response.  Old Earl.  Oh, my God.  He broke that microphone.  He broke it.  The microphone that he slammed down.  There we go.  Yeah.  Hello, baby.  Like, he fixed it.  Oh, my God.  What happened?  Did you see Sly and the Family Stone last night?  In this room?  Yes.  Oh, no.  In this room?  Yes, we did.  What was on the big TVs, though, in our office?  What was on the big TVs?  All night was Fox.  So, you were in there, and you had a concern about shutting something off, and then Fox 
[03:24:30]  just came on by itself?  No, it was on when I walked in the room!  Then why were you on the computer with Eric trying to fix the program?  No, not fix the program.  We were on the computer.  So, Earl, is the point you're trying to make that the O&A guys never set up the bullpen to  record the Grammys?  The show, it was on Fox all night.  They fucked up.  So, they fucked up, and they're blaming it on you.  I'm not saying they did or they didn't.  I'm just saying, I'm telling you what I walked into.  It was on Fox. 
[03:25:00]  What happened?  Now what's going on?  Uh-oh.  They're taking him out of his room.  What happened?  Why?  Steve, what happened?  Here comes Thayen.  Why is Master Poe trying to remove Earl from the room?  What happened?  Why?  What is going on in there?  What it looks like.  Why?  Working the equipment.  What?  They don't want...  Washington doesn't want Earl working the equipment anymore because they're afraid.  D.C. has called.  D.C. has called.  Headquarters has called. 
[03:25:30]  Oh.  Get out of there.  Oh, that's going to put him in an even better mode.  Oh, yeah.  All right.  Well...  Free up his mic.  Yeah.  Earl, who said that you had to get away from the equipment?  Oh, fuck.  I don't know.  I was told D.C.  Who from D.C.?  I have no idea.  Who got the call?  I don't know why I got removed.  Who got the call?  I don't know who got the call either.  Wow.  Cindy Sheehan at the State of the Union address.  Come with me, miss.  It's of his command.  Yeah.  They're pulling you out of there, Captain Bly. 
[03:26:00]  This is Captain Bly.  They're going to put him in a little skiff.  Enough water.  And here's my sextant.  I know it to be in working order.  Who knows who made the call from D.C.?  Poe, how did you know to pull him out?  Steve told him.  Steve.  All right.  Well, let's get Steve, then.  Yeah.  This is a fine chain of command.  Let's play the drug game.  All right.  Who gave you the dope? 
[03:26:30]  Because that money's going to the terrorists.  Where's Steve C.?  Steve is wandering to the other side of the building.  He doesn't want...  Steve.  Here comes Ben.  Ben.  Somebody come in and say why Earl can't touch his board anymore.  Believe it or not, we're still trying to do a radio show here.  I mean...  Steve.  Earl.  Who told you to tell Poe?  To pull Earl.  Ben got a call from Wiki.  And Wiki said, get Earl off the board, please. 
[03:27:00]  Uh-oh.  Wiki, huh?  Wiki?  Yeah.  He didn't want him breaking the equipment.  I think that's an executive decision.  I was throwing equipment around.  Proving he doesn't know good radio when he hears it, though.  Jesus.  Earl, now you've got to figure out a way to get even with Wiki.  That's the problem for you.  I wouldn't give even one to anybody.  I just want to do my damn job.  I would get a box, put some stuff in it, and write Wiki across the top of it.  Or give him a radio show and then produce it.  If your job is lying and ruining our clip, job well done. 
[03:27:30]  Earl, how did you feel when you saw the box with your name on it?  Amongst the boxes of the other people that are leaving here?  He was not happy.  That's everything he owns.  Did it make you sad?  No, not at all.  It made me very angry.  There's a hot plate and a can of beans in there.  Why don't you show Wiki and start breaking some of the stuff in here?  If you were going postal, who would you take out first?  I don't know.  When you're not getting angry, I don't think straight.  But just saying, who would you take out first?  Whoever's in front of me, quite honestly. 
[03:28:00]  Hey.  Sure.  Hey, crime.  Are we good?  Everything okay now, Earl?  No, it's not.  I don't...  I'm not going to say anything.  Why don't you just tell us what happened on SpongeBob last night?  Maybe that's the way to go.  That always cheers you up.  A little SpongeBob.  No?  Earl, comment?  None.  Earl's having to touch back to Carol Miller and Scott to walk it down the hallway. 
[03:28:30]  Just like the old days.  This really is a long relationship that you've had with this, Earl.  This is the way, basically, Fez and I met you during one of these heats.  Who's the black guy?  Why is he so upset?  Full circle.  All eyes are on you, Earl.  Keep going.  I'm not saying anything.  You just said something, though.  Real mature, Earl. 
[03:29:00]  All right, how do we get back to square one, Earl?  How do you fix this thing?  I want to do a radio show.  Let's bring it all back together here.  I said I didn't want to discuss it.  Let's move on.  Why don't you do this?  Turn back time.  Turn back time.  Turn back time.  I think Cher said it best.  Yes.  On the Grammys last night.  Did you see it, Earl?  It was great.  Fez will be wearing the Cher outfit for you.  How's that?  Nothing?  How much damage did you do at N.E.W. over the years? 
[03:29:30]  I know a phone was smashed there.  Two microphones.  I got you beat.  Two microphones.  I think a studio door.  Oh, yeah.  Who kicked in that door that cost a couple of grand?  No, that wasn't me.  It happened twice, but one was completely an accident.  Right.  All right, Earl.  All right.  Let's all sing together here.  There you go, Earl. 
[03:30:00]  Sing it, Earl.  Like a Jenny Craig commercial.  Earl, what did you think of Sly and the Family Stone last night?  Weird.  Is there some reason he turned into Wendy O. Williams?  Is there any reason at all that happened over the years?  I don't even think that was him.  I don't know who the fuck that was.  What the hell was that?  I don't know what that was.  He walks on stage for two minutes, plays a little bit, and walks away?  And they kept his mic off.  Yeah.  I would, too. 
[03:30:30]  It's the kindest thing you could do.  Wiki called halfway through the Grammys.  Get him off the stage.  Earl, comment.  Yeah, it was weird.  It's up to you, man.  Tell Opie how you really feel.  You're the leader.  You've got to do something here.  You're an EP.  All eyes are on you.  Washington's listening.  No, we...  Canada's listening.  As far as I'm concerned, America's listening.  America's listening.  America's listening.  America's listening.  I mean, actually, Don and I, we had a very good talk this morning, and we worked it out.  About what?  Just all this.  Yeah.  So I'm like, it's over in my mind.  Well, here's a good thing. 
[03:31:00]  It's very difficult to fire a black man.  Very difficult.  You always got that going.  When it's you and Snoop Dogg are the only ones in the company.  Now it's Ludacris.  Oh, whatever.  Oh, we got Oprah.  Yeah.  We got Snoop Dogg.  Yeah.  And Ludacris.  Ludacris has a show also.  Yeah.  Yeah.  What are those guys like?  And Tyra Banks, so you better start being careful.  They're getting quite stable.  This place is really fucking changed.  Right.  Before you know it, they're going to close a train station. 
[03:31:30]  It's all what's happening around here.  Nothing, Earl?  No.  How about a laugh?  Bring us all together.  No, I do apologize for walking off.  Sure.  What are you apologizing to?  How far did you get?  I went, there was like a bathroom.  I had a splash of water on my face.  Earl.  I just heard a bunch of people running down the stairs like a, like, these freaking guys  were like trailing me like an army.  Earl, I think you owe me an apology.  I think so, Joe.  A big, sincere one. 
[03:32:00]  I was the one.  For what?  For what?  I saved you.  Really?  I'm not helping.  I saved you from N.E.W.  You were miserable there.  I talked to these guys.  Forced.  I vouched for you.  Forced.  I had long discussions with these guys saying that I know Earl could do the job.  Threatened.  He's changing.  I think he could be a leader.  I think he could be great in a leadership role.  And this is how you treat me.  I just want you to thank me for bringing you to XM.  That's all.  I think I deserve that. 
[03:32:30]  Have I thanked you yet?  You have never officially thanked me for bringing you to XM.  I have said to your face on mortar when it gave you.  Quite frankly, I'm insulted.  Thank you for the opportunity.  Thank you for bringing me to XM.  Thank you for rescuing me from the hell that became N.E.W.  I hope you actually have to convince D.C. that you're not black.  You're Northern Italian.  So, you're thanking me.  And I always thank you.  All right.  Thank me to my face.  I'm doing it now.  All right. 
[03:33:00]  I don't hear a thank you.  I didn't either, sir.  Good point.  What about anything for Ant?  Yeah.  What about Ant for Jimmy?  He's still there?  Yeah.  What about Anthony?  Thank you, Anthony.  All right.  You always stood up for me, Anthony.  I will say that.  What about a little dance?  No.  All right.  I didn't know how far I could go.  What about a little song?  And you're going to apologize for what you did today?  You kind of wrecked our show.  Let's be honest.  I did not wreck that show.  No matter what it was, you kind of wrecked the show. 
[03:33:30]  Just apologize.  We'll move on.  I will forget about it.  But I think you own myself, Jim Norton, and the rest of the gang.  A little bit of apology, because things got screwed up today.  Right, Anthony?  Absolutely.  Just a little apology.  If that will end it, yes.  I apologize.  Apologize for what?  No, I'm serious.  Yeah.  I don't think I'm in a position to accept.  Apologize for what?  He's still hurting.  Just say apologize for wrecking our show today.  And for lying about it in a filthy, disgusting fashion. 
[03:34:00]  We'll accept an apology that you...  Let's get it over with, Earl.  We'll accept an apology that you wrecked our show today.  You know what it is?  My pride is something you're like, wait a minute.  You're going to own up to something you didn't do?  Well, you have to.  Yeah, get rid of the pride.  I really need an apology.  I got to tell you.  It's been a tough morning for me.  But Sting, you feel, is pride.  All right?  Just apologize.  It's not like people are going to remember.  Trust me.  No, it'll care.  Fuck pride.  These guys have such great radio ahead in the next couple hours.  It doesn't matter.  You might feel a little too...  If it makes it go away, I'm sorry.  I'm in the office. 
[03:34:30]  Pride.  Fucking with you.  Fuck pride.  He apologized to us.  I think that was the right thing to do, Earl.  All right.  All right.  He apologized.  Okay, Earl.  I accept.  There you go.  Do you feel better, Earl?  No, I do not.  Like you got it off your chest?  But, Earl, don't you believe the office is a restricted country club?  Just pretend it's Augusta. 
[03:35:00]  All right, Earl.  Black people at Bushwood, sir.  He's smiling a little bit, Anthony.  Yeah.  You almost got him.  All right.  Are you happy now, Earl?  Everything back to normal?  I'm not going to lie.  I'm fucking furious.  Why?  With who?  With it.  With just the it.  But you apologized.  Things are all right.  Yeah.  By it, he means white people. 
[03:35:30]  I thought that was the man.  New word.  Yeah.  All right, Earl.  Can I go home now?  Nobody told you you couldn't go home.  All right.  All right.  There we go.  You're not going to chase him down the stairs, are you?  No.  I have no gripes.  Look at Poe.  He's waiting for me to snap.  He's going to break my neck if I go after him.  Call Wiki and see if Earl can get back in his hole.  See if everything's forgiven.  Because you're no good out here, Earl.  I'm not used to you in this room. 
[03:36:00]  What?  I didn't want to come in here.  I like my room.  Do you want to tell Wiki right now I'm not crazy?  No, I'm not crazy.  Nothing sounds crazier than something else.  I know.  It's the worst thing that you can say.  I am not crazy.  Just saying, when I lose it, I lose it.  I totally lose it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That was a big surprise today.  Didn't expect that.  Like Chekhov did after they pulled the creature out of his ear and wrapped it. 
[03:36:30]  It's very difficult.  We're getting a communique, Steve.  Ensign Earl reporting for duty, sir.  Steve, why don't you grab that mic?  I mean, sorry.  It's your show.  I'm just used to the...  You can go ahead and grab it.  Yeah.  Posse.  Earl, it's okay if you want to get back on the board.  There you go.  The okay from D.C.  And...  And...  You go, Earl!  You go, baby!  Yeah!  Yeah! 
[03:37:00]  Hey, show Wiki.  Go in there and take a shit on that board and say, here's what I think you're excited.  That's right.  Get back in there.  Yeah.  Get back in there.  And take charge, Earl.  Yeah.  This business needs you.  No, it doesn't.  Hey, do you got a new opening?  Is that what you did last night?  Yeah, we did a couple of things.  Then why don't we...  We'll take a break and we come back.  It's a brand new show with Earl's brand new opening.  All right?  Yeah.  Huh?  And we start from there.  Let's take those sunglasses off and you're a sunshiny guy. 
[03:37:30]  No, actually, I do need them there because the glare is awful.  Sure you do.  All right.  Thank you guys for having me on, by the way.  I'll be on your show.  Yeah.  Anytime you'd like.  Thank you.  You know, once, let's see if the HBO show takes off.  I'd love to have you come in.  Thanks, guys.  All right.  Talk to you later.  Thanks, Joe and A.  Jimmy.  Hey, boys.  I love you, Earl.  We're going to take a break and it's a brand new Earl's show with your opening and everything's  going to be great.  Right, Earl?  Yes.  Okay.  Hey, it's Eastside Dave here.  Run Fez Noon to 3. 
[03:38:00]  You're listening to two goddamn superstars, Mr. H and Mr. C.  You better have some motherfucking respect for Opie and Anthony.  This is their worst of.  Fez, look who just walked in here.  It's our good friend, Eastside Dave.  Dave, you were telling me off the air, you were the gentleman in here last night with  Black Girl.  Yeah.  Sorry about that.  You got to turn on the mic.  Yes, I was in there with Earl.  I had to take a break from the hot dog stand and was helping Earl out with the production. 
[03:38:30]  And what happened?  Well, I don't think he meant to do it, but he did use a remote control at one point and  changed the channels.  And from my understanding, the channels then get changed on every single computer and it  was the computers that were recording the Grammys.  So that, they didn't get it because the remote control was changed on all of them.  Why would he have the remote control? 
[03:39:00]  Well, I don't know.  I don't know.  That was a strange thing.  And I did actually mention to him, don't change the channel because there's a sign in there.  And I'm very nervous when I have gone in there occasionally.  I don't go in without Earl.  Right.  Um, and, uh, so I, I always tell him, you know, uh, make sure you see the sign.  I don't even sit on the chairs for lack of changing the settings on the chair.  All right.  So you are saying 100% in your opinion, Earl was responsible for the boys not having their 
[03:39:30]  Grammy tapes this morning.  Well, I don't want to, um, sell anyone down.  You're not selling anybody down the river.  Or the one thing that was a little, was a sticking point with me is I was listening  to ONA today and he kept saying we, and he kept saying, I'll assume responsibility.  Right.  And when you say that, it sort of sounds like it's somebody else's fault.  It's someone else's and it, it wasn't me.  And I, I know Earl's a great guy and everything like that. 
[03:40:00]  It was, you're covering up rather than just on his facts.  We don't want opinions.  Earl, the facts is definitely change the channel.  That's all we needed to know.  Earl, change the channel.  Why didn't you own up to that first thing this morning?  Say, I went in there, I changed the channel.  I put on Fox, I put on SpongeBob.  I made a mistake.  I'm sorry, guys.  Number one, because I'm not going to scream because I didn't change the channel.  Why would he say?  It was on Fox the entire day, that entire night. 
[03:40:30]  Let me go back to Eastside.  I did turn the volume down, but I did not change the channel.  All right, let me check with Eastside Dave.  Then you must have hit a wrong button by accident because what happened was.  One minute I heard Hannity, and then one minute it went down.  No, the screen went off.  The screen went off.  The screen never went off.  I turned the volume down.  I never changed the channel.  It was on Fox the entire evening. 
[03:41:00]  It very briefly went to snow.  It very briefly.  He might not have even seen it.  He's got bad eyes.  But it very briefly went to snow.  Then I said, don't change the channel, Earl.  There's a sign that says, don't change the channels.  He changed it right back.  I see the sign every day.  It was one second.  No, here's what happened.  It was one second on the TV.  So on their main TV, nothing happened.  But if you start fucking around with the remote control, it fucks up there.  I know what I'm calling you.  It hits all of the computers.  I turned the goddamn volume down. 
[03:41:30]  It was on Fox.  It was on Fox all night.  So, Earl, are you going with the technicality of maybe you didn't change channels, but you  did turn it off?  No.  I turned the volume down.  For two seconds, there was snow.  That's not it.  There was snow.  Well, I...  Completely it.  No.  No, it's not it.  You changed, too.  Earl, let me just ask this.  Why would Dave come in and say that he saw it if he didn't?  There's no upside for him.  No, I'm saying nothing.  That's what I'm going to say. 
[03:42:00]  I'll do lie detector.  I'll do lie detector.  I'm guilty, okay?  I will do lie detector.  I'm guilty of guilty because everyone is assuming it, no matter what I say.  I didn't assume it.  No, I'm sorry, Ryan.  I had dropped the whole thing.  I'm terribly sorry.  I didn't mean you and Fezzy.  But everyone's assuming it.  Everyone is believing it.  Then it must be true.  I didn't.  The problem is he's trying to Clinton-ify it.  Right.  And it's very simple.  I'm not trying to Clinton...  I am not...  I have not done anything.  You're overmodulating.  That's what I'm doing. 
[03:42:30]  I'm getting blamed for shit I didn't do.  Period.  He wore his sunglasses three-quarters of the show because he couldn't look anyone in the  eyes because he knows he had done it.  No, because I am seething.  That's why.  Let me ask Eastside.  You can't look anyone in the eyes because you know you're fucking seething right now.  All right.  Everything was dropped until Dave came in with this information.  Eastside, did the big TV in the O&A office go to snow...  It went to snow very briefly.  ...while Earl had the remote in his hand?  Earl was right.  When we went in, it was on Fox News. 
[03:43:00]  He hit the remote control.  It went to snow very briefly.  He hit another button.  It went back to Fox News.  So the TV in their thing was not fucked up at all.  But I guess if you start hitting the remote control, it can mess up their computers, which  is why...  You're making it sound like I was holding the thing the entire show.  No, no.  It was three seconds.  I said that.  I said it was three seconds.  I said it was three seconds.  But the thing is...  I am not having to start.  You can't look...  You have to look at that sign. 
[03:43:30]  That's why I don't fucking touch a fucking thing because we all know what happened to  Harry, and I don't fucking want to go even fucking near that shit.  So I don't even...  I pick up a playboy.  I play right back in the same spot.  You feel like you were being set up when they're all going, I'll take responsibility.  He kept saying on the ONA show today, I'll take responsibility for this, which then...  I am not to it!  Don't take responsibility!  You did not say that, Earl.  You did not say I did this.  You said I'll take responsibility, which most of the listeners sounds like someone from 
[03:44:00]  I am the leader of this group.  Whatever...  It is ultimately my responsibility.  I am completely owning up to it.  How many times do I have to say that?  Earl.  I am owning up to it.  One more time.  It sounds...  Make it nice and clear for everybody.  Okay.  I am responsible.  Okay?  Thank you.  Happy?  But that was the main thing about...  Earlier in the show was that you weren't saying, I did it.  You just kept saying, I'll take responsibility for this. 
[03:44:30]  Don't blame my staff.  I took responsibility for it.  What else do you want?  What else do you want, Dave?  I got hammered for an hour and a half on the air.  What else do you want from me?  What do you want from me?  What else?  What if the staff got blamed?  A lot of people think it was the staff.  I will...  You know, I'm going to think and do things completely on my own now.  And the staff isn't very large.  That's one of the points that I had to bring up also.  What's that?  You need a bigger staff?  Absolutely. 
[03:45:00]  Yeah.  Who's keeping you from that?  Wiki?  Budgets.  We're going to need a bigger staff, but Wiki keeps pulling Earl off of this board.  Dave, you saw him turn it off?  Yeah, by mistake.  You know, but he had the remote control.  And that...  The one thing is you wouldn't have called E-Rock if you didn't do it.  So don't just stop.  No.  And that was early.  That was...  I can name the time that happened.  It was like 7.30.  And that's when you did it, but that's why... 
[03:45:30]  Right before the Grammys.  But that's the point.  That's why...  So how did...  Wait a minute.  If I did this before the Grammys, right?  They were on the air saying, we got eight minutes of the Grammys.  So obviously it was after 8 o'clock.  But maybe a timer got switched.  It was obviously after 8 o'clock.  Which means...  If...  I called E-Rock at 7.30.  Right.  Easily.  7...  Like 7-ish.  7.30.  Why is everyone blaming you then, Earl?  I don't know.  I really don't know.  I'm not blaming them.  Did you read the sign?  You think I...  You know the history I have with these guys. 
[03:46:00]  You think I want to get in their freaking shithouse?  Yeah.  Do you honestly believe I'm that much of a glutton for punishment?  Then why didn't you see?  I had to point out the sign to them.  What sign?  The sign that says, don't change any of the channels, don't touch anything about the TVs,  anything, exclamation point, point, point, point.  He never saw that sign before.  That's true.  Right?  Everything was dropped, Dave, until you came in and started doing this.  Well, someone said to go in.  All right. 
[03:46:30]  Earl?  I didn't want to come in, but someone said...  Well, and you're worried about yourself getting blamed.  I understand that.  Yeah, because it is...  It did come across...  I'm just saying, Earl, just relax.  But I'm just saying, it did come across...  Just relax, you're the one who got him upset.  He was fine.  He was fine.  It was like the RonFest.net, or RonFest.net, RonFest staff.  Yeah.  And all I'm saying is...  It's like you sold them out.  A little bit.  So don't get pissed off at me.  I'm just trying to square up the facts about it wasn't necessarily a staff issue. 
[03:47:00]  It might have been just on Big Papa's shoulders.  I know what the issues are.  There's plenty of issues, and those issues will get worked out.  What issues?  Let's work them out now, buddy.  Let me and Fez back you up here.  What are they doing to Earl?  I'm on Earl's side.  Yeah.  What issues do we need to work on?  Mainly upgrading our office, which again, we worked...  Right.  Like I said, we worked this all out this morning.  Who?  You and Wiggy?  Yes.  We talked about this this morning.  He actually sent me an email on some things.  We're working this out. 
[03:47:30]  So you feel like maybe this is all a good thing.  Yeah.  Me yelling and screaming and acting like a lunatic, maybe it has.  You know what?  I noticed that when you went to throw the mic this time, you didn't do it.  You held it into your hand.  No, I'm trying not to lose control.  Right.  And you know what?  And I have respect for the room and for the equipment.  Right.  And you know what?  I don't want to do that because you know what?  The screw's great.  The XM guys are great. 
[03:48:00]  Yeah.  And I don't want to piss them off.  Well, especially since you have Poe standing behind you now, willing to break your neck  because you're out of control, Earl.  No, I'm out of control when...  Never mind.  Go ahead.  Say it.  Let's just finish this now so we don't have to pick it up tomorrow.  Amen.  I don't want to pick it up today.  Yeah.  Me neither.  I didn't even know anything about any of this until I came in.  Well, no.  It was like basically for a solid hour between like 850... 
[03:48:30]  Between two separate sets of phone calls, I was basically screamed at for an hour.  Right.  And then screamed at on the air.  Again.  For something...  That you were put in a tough position by XM.  And to me, everything was all settled until Dave came in and told the truth.  That's the problem.  The truth has to be told, as Kevin Costner from JFK told me.  WJFK?  W...  Yeah. 
[03:49:00]  He was doing the overnights.  Kevi Coe.  All right, Earl.  I wish you would have just told the truth earlier.  And that would have settled everything.  Yeah.  It seems like it would have saved a lot of grief, especially on your own.  I was telling the truth all along.  Oh, did you?  This is Black Girl, and I approve this worst of.  It's the worst.  The worst.  We'll be back with more of the worst of Opie and Anthony featuring Travis.  Lady Delighted.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  Opie and Anthony. 
[03:49:30]  Master Poe, and with all due respect, Poe, you kind of would run after a female dog because it's female.  Wow.  You're kind of known around this place to be a little flirtatious, to look at a lot of the girls and stuff.  So it's hard to really gauge how much, you know, if you're just being Poe.  Let's just put it this way.  He does a lot of his dating in the back parking lot at FH Ryder.  Oh, shit.  Jesus. 
[03:50:00]  Why is everyone looking away?  Okay.  Wow.  Yeah, Poe, the FH doesn't mean fuck here.  No, you didn't.  No, you didn't.  Hey, guys.  This is Master Poe.  You're listening to the worst of Master Poe.  The worst.  It's the worst.  It's the worst of Opie and Anthony.  The worst.  With Travis.  Holy mackerel, am I enjoying that radio program.  Hi, you're listening to the worst of Opie and Anthony. 
[03:50:30]  Hi.  Hi.  I'm Travis.  Sam's yawning.  Yeah.  So are a lot of other people at home.  That's not true.  Oh, man.  I love punishing the audience.  That's why we gave Travis a show.  Oh, dude.  We heard your baseball talk.  What are you talking about?  That's great.  I got more laughs with my Than and Sam plug.  What are you talking about?  All right.  All right.  That was it for the worst of the Opie and Anthony show featuring Travis's pick. 
[03:51:00]  This shit sucks.  Wait, is that the outro?  Everybody have a good time.  That's the...  Ah, shut up.  That's the outro?  No more?  That was a good out.  We didn't need to think of a punchline.  So then we'll cut out my...  No, we won't.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  This concludes the worst of Opie and Anthony.
