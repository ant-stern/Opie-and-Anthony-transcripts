<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a lengthy segment dissecting Howard Stern's move to Sirius and comparing it to their own success on XM.  Opie and Anthony played listener-submitted audio, news clips, and blog posts, mocking Stern's appearance and alleged cosmetic surgeries. They contrasted XM and Sirius' business strategies, arguing for XM's superiority and portraying Stern's move as a financially motivated failure, citing Barron's negative assessment of Sirius.  The hosts used frequent vulgar language and insults towards Stern and Robin Quivers.  They teased upcoming segments including a discussion of Kobe Bryant's 81-point game, one host's OnStar emergency call, and a game to determine which host had seen *Brokeback Mountain*. Patrice O'Neill joined the show towards the end of this segment.

Patrice O'Neill remained as a studio guest for a substantial portion of the show.  Discussions included Opie's brother's new restaurant, F.H. Riley's (named after Opie's late father and his niece), its quirky menu ("angry typing guy chicken fingers," "the oopsie" drink), and planned Opie and Anthony themed d√©cor. Anthony detailed his Black History Month MySpace Top 8, which consisted of African-American listener profiles and cartoon characters, sparking discussion about his other MySpace friends and his interest in the racist band Prussian Blue.  Opie and Patrice discussed their attempts at forging a friendship outside the show, contrasting it with Opie's experience with Bob Kelly.  Kobe Bryant's 81-point game was discussed, comparing his achievement to O.J. Simpson's ability to overcome negative publicity.  A significant portion focused on the O.J. Simpson trial, filled with offensive language and extended bits, including prank calls.  The hosts promoted their upcoming "American Mess" segment and briefly discussed Super Bowl XL and female NFL sideline reporters, focusing on their perceived lack of journalistic integrity and use of sex appeal.

A segment followed featuring a highly satirical and sexually charged parody of sports sideline reporting, using a fictional Pam Oliver.  The hosts used degrading terms for the fictional reporter and made numerous sexually suggestive remarks. Listener-submitted audio, including a vulgar parody of "I Must Be Doing Something Right" and a drunken Joe Namath interview, were played. A live, sexually explicit "Guess What's in My Pants" segment with a caller, Becky, took place via Paltalk, involving descriptions of sounds made by rubbing the phone against her genitals to guess her pubic hair. This was interrupted by an inappropriate message from another Paltalk user. Opie shared a disturbing experience viewing a Manhattan brownstone where a previous owner's son had committed suicide.  The hosts addressed listener feedback from their "Whack Bag" forum, including criticism of Opie's use of "absolutely" and Anthony's use of "stinks on ice."

Another "Guess What's in My Pants" segment occurred, with Patrice O'Neill falling asleep.  This segment, involving caller Becky and using webcam, featured sexually explicit and offensive comments from hosts and callers.  The show then transitioned to a discussion of a guest, Steve, who had seen *Brokeback Mountain* with his wife. This discussion was filled with homophobic slurs and graphic descriptions of the film's sex scenes, with callers adding to the vulgarity. The show concluded abruptly with brief, unrelated discussions, including Terry Schiavo's husband's remarriage and further offensive remarks from callers, acknowledging a planned "field trip" that did not happen.

Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.  It's set up. 
[00:04:30]  No crap, Sherlock.  Die.  Die.  Die.  They don't hate them.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  That's funny.  I'm funny.  Shut up.  Shut up. 
[00:05:00]  Shut up.  Jesus Christ, man.  What the hell is wrong with you?  Please.  Just shut up.  I'm a cop, you idiot.  Hi.  How are you?  How did the governor get to call me?  I would like to just get to know you.  Mama. 
[00:05:30]  Mama.  Mama.  Shut up.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Quiet.  Stop whining.  Stop it.  Hey, good morning. 
[00:06:00]  This is the Opie and Anthony program on XM Satellite Radio.  Hi.  We call it a virus.  The ONA virus.  Yes, we do.  Basically how it works, if you enjoy what you're hearing on this fine radio program, you tell a friend.  And that spreads.  And that's how the virus spreads.  An audio version of the bird flu. 
[00:06:30]  And then the show gets more gooder, and then we get more money.  Is that how it works?  Absolutely.  Who are we kidding?  I don't think the listeners care about that, though, as much as we do.  I don't think the listeners want to hear that, but it's about time we tell them that.  Yeah, we're staying on until we get $600 million each.  Absolutely.  Each.  Not split.  We'll make that Howie money. 
[00:07:00]  Good old Howie.  We was babbling on a show about us on Friday, I guess.  The pests have turned us on.  They informed us.  Yes.  The pests like to inform us when things are going awry out there in Radioland.  The pests keep us informed of all situations.  Situations.  They're all over the place.  That go on.  They work for the competition. 
[00:07:30]  They work for all these TV stations in New York City.  They're embedded.  They are everywhere.  They're embedded.  It is Project Mayhem.  Project Mayhem is unfolding in front of your eyes.  Yes.  The radio version.  It's the closest thing to Fight Club.  It is real.  We just do our show, and then all of a sudden we get all sorts of reports after every single radio show.  Yeah.  And then we go through all the information, the communique.  Here's what this guy did.  We've got to sort out the accurate stuff from the bullshit. 
[00:08:00]  That's right.  Intelligence people.  That's right.  Plying over dossiers.  Yeah, we've got to throw the Opie and Anthony filter into everything.  Right, right.  But they're attacking message boards.  They're letting us know what this guy said on his blog.  Oh, yeah.  What this website is saying about us.  They're informed.  The latest news articles on us.  It's very nice.  It's very informed.  We absolutely love our pests.  And we love the fact that they're getting smarter and smarter every day.  It's like training.  They're kind of learning by trial and error what works, what doesn't. 
[00:08:30]  They've got a little hierarchy going on.  There's always a little infighting, which is good.  Competition.  Keeps them honest.  Keeps them honest.  Keeps them working hard.  There's always somebody underneath the top dog trying to knock him off his perch.  That's right.  That's how it should work, right?  That's insane.  So, uh...  Little militants.  We got some Howard Stern communique.  Yeah.  And we just love playing this stuff because he's just out of his fucking mind. 
[00:09:00]  Yeah.  I think the facelift is really starting to take its toll on the guy.  Think it cut off some circulation to the brain?  I think it's made him more delusional, that's for sure.  What about the liposucking from under his chin?  The waddle?  Because he had that done, too.  He got rid of the waddle?  Yeah.  He got the waddle, the nose job, what, facelift?  Yeah.  That's all great.  That's all...  The hair?  That's everything you want from your radio host.  The teeth, right? 
[00:09:30]  Yeah, the laminants or something.  Then the hair extensions and hair dyeing.  Well, we were told years ago that he adds hair.  Yeah.  A fine client that was advertising on our old show claims that good old Howie adds a lot  of hair.  Yeah, adds it in every so often.  And then there's the hair coloring.  Hair coloring.  You got to do that because there's no...  There ain't no...  Find me one over 50-year-old man that doesn't at least have some gray at the temples. 
[00:10:00]  Just stop it.  Stop it.  Well, that's what you want in your radio host.  A faggot.  I mean, if that's what you want to do...  That gets his hair done at the parlor.  If that's what you want to do, that's fine.  But again...  That wears Boy Scout uniforms.  It just makes you look a little hypocritical and a little against everything you railed  against building the career, you know?  Right.  It was always about finding out these Hollywood types that do this stuff, that get the cosmetic 
[00:10:30]  surgery and act like they didn't get it.  How many times have you heard that during the golden years when Stern used to be good?  How many times did you hear about this one leaving his wife for the trophy girlfriend and  then the kids getting in some kind of trouble because of it?  And then all of a sudden, all this is unfolding in his own life.  And I think he's getting a little crazy about it.  Well, he had some fun things to say about us and our company. 
[00:11:00]  All right.  What could he possibly say against...  Whatever he could say about us.  It's very hard to bash XM when you're working at Sirius.  When is he going to actually do a radio show and stop trying to bash everybody?  And he's already claiming that the government is going to regulate satellite radio.  Because of him.  So there's, you know, so there's hours and hours of stuff he could talk about there instead  of actually doing a entertaining radio show. 
[00:11:30]  Well, the past 10 years, and this is as per his confession, he's done subpar radio.  He said that.  We have audio of him saying, I did subpar radio for 10 years because of the reason he gave  was the government stepping in, blah, blah, blah.  Now you're on a medium where there's no government stepping in to regulate you, and he's still  doing the same thing.  Like, all this promise of this great new show on this unregulated medium just isn't coming 
[00:12:00]  true.  The people aren't hearing it.  And the reviews on the new show are absolutely horrendous.  They're abysmal.  And it's not like this guy had two years off and came into radio and needed, you know,  a couple of weeks or months to build up to speed or anything.  He was doing a show.  I thought the first few weeks on XM were great for us.  They stunk on ice.  Thank God we weren't talking to anyone.  Oh, thank God they had us under lock and key on some premium service that, like, 15 of 
[00:12:30]  our greatest fans were subscribed to.  Hugh Pinero had us so buried within the service, you couldn't even find us.  I got radios for my whole family, and subs went up 50%.  Wow, were they a little frightened about what we were going to do under lock and key.  They really thought we had devil horns.  Thank God.  And then they finally came to their senses and opened us up to the full platform. 
[00:13:00]  And then our stupid critic said, well, that proves that they're failing miserably on satellite radio.  Let me tell you something about Opie and Anthony.  Ladies and gentlemen, if they were being successful.  Ladies and gentlemen, angry typing guy.  The company would have kept him on the premium.  One of my favorite characters.  Angry typing guy.  I just love these delusional asses out there that think they know something. 
[00:13:30]  Yeah.  Taking us off the premium meant that we were actually being successful.  We were doing well.  We weren't scaring the company.  They had to fire us because we were so evil that nobody was buying XM because of us.  See, because following the logic, if we failed miserably when we were on the premium channel,  for the new XMers, you know, there was a thing where you sign up for the service,  and then there was a couple channels you could go, oh, I'll add this, this, and this, you know. 
[00:14:00]  Yeah, but if that was the truth, that the reason they took us off the premium channel  was because we were failing miserably, wouldn't they have just fired us at that point?  Yeah.  You stupid ass that types hard on their fucking typewriter.  And talks funny as he does it.  Mm-hmm.  Yeah, that was a big thing.  But, yeah, we finally, you know, got off of that and was open up to the platform.  It's been nothing but growth since then.  Absolutely.  Amazing.  Absolutely.  And then you got how he was doing a show one week, a couple of weeks later. 
[00:14:30]  He's doing his new show, the one that's been hyped and pumped and talked about  and on the news and he's done interviews.  And all we heard was how spectacular, revolutionary was a word that came up a lot,  cutting edge that this was going to be.  And I'm not even talking about the Opie and Anthony Sheep or any of this.  I'm talking about hardcore Stern fans. 
[00:15:00]  We got our guys out there in the field.  They report to us with message boards from hardcore Stern fans.  They come up and say, hmm, this just ain't doing it.  It ain't it.  Where is it?  Where's the show?  Well, because now it seems he's just talking about being shut up again.  Well, yeah, the front page of the post today, I guess he's being censored already over there.  Now, I don't know what to make of this.  This to me sounds like a way he can do the show he used to do, which was just get on and pretty much spend three hours or so bitching. 
[00:15:30]  About something.  About something.  That's what he's done.  That's his number one thing he does on a show is just bitch about how he can't do a radio show.  Those 10 years that he said he was doing subpar radio, it was 10 years of bitching about things he can't do because of some overpowering entity.  Right.  Well, the cover of the New York Post says,  Mouth trap.  Stern will have to clean up his act on Sirius. 
[00:16:00]  Howard Stern may be coming down with a Sirius, spelt like the company, case of the bleeps.  May I?  Yeah.  High-level executives of the satellite broadcaster are developing an internal standards and practices document that will set boundaries for Stern and other shock jocks the Post has learned.  Well, yeah, I mean, because they hire guys that aren't that creative and are just known for being very, very dirty and they're realizing that's not getting the job done. 
[00:16:30]  Yeah.  You know?  Actually, there's more to it that I'd rather not say right now.  Oh.  But how their whole system is set up, they're pretty fucked.  Yeah.  They're pretty fucked.  See, we took care of all that when we started XM.  Mm-hmm.  That's all I can say right now.  We'll have more on that as the days go on.  Let the speculation threads start.  Thank you.  But, yeah, so he'll spend this whole show today bitching that, you know, now Sirius is censoring him. 
[00:17:00]  And then there's Barron's that just came out and basically just kills the company.  Absolutely kills the company.  Barron's, oh, God, that's not a reputable Dow Jones business magazine, Robin.  Barron's.  I've never heard of it.  This is pretty much one of the top three Wall Street publications.  Yeah, we better get this article up on all the fan sites. 
[00:17:30]  He's on the big headline.  He's on the front page of Barron's.  You never want to be on the front page of Barron's with this headline, ever.  Don't bet on Howard.  Well, it's a whole article basically, you know, showing by just cold, hard facts why XM is so much better than the little doggie company.  Dude, I read that article.  There's graphs in it.  There's pie charts. 
[00:18:00]  There's pie charts and graphs.  No speculation, just cold, hard numbers.  Real facts.  Not idiots in front of microphones that think that just because they're talking in the mic that it's the truth.  This show.  I'm talking about cold, hard facts from Barron's.  That's right.  And, yeah, it wasn't looking good.  Their numbers.  So it was a pretty bad day for Howie and that cute little company over there.  Bark!  Bark!  They're on the front page basically saying they have to censor their top dog. 
[00:18:30]  And Barron's is actually absolutely killing the company and showing everyone why XM is the better company.  Now, I see they're censoring him.  Curse is foiled again for Stern.  Curse is foiled again.  Get it?  Mm-hmm.  Oof.  We got a little mention in here.  XM, which is now the home to shock jocks Opie and Anthony.  Shock jocks.  Confirmed that it had its own guidelines in place for some time now. 
[00:19:00]  Really?  But declined to provide details.  Really?  All right.  Look, if we could get ELO or someone to tell us what these guidelines could be.  Because as I look back on what we've talked about over the past almost year and a half that we've been here on satellite radio, I'm thinking the only boundary that really is in effect here is if me and Opie decide to fuck each other right on this console. 
[00:19:30]  That could, and I'm not even sure of that one.  Well, and that's where we would finally censor ourselves.  Maybe self-censoring would come into play.  I'm just being hypothetical here.  But what boundary could there have?  Take any clip Jim Norton has uttered on this program.  Right.  There should be a boundary.  I'm for boundaries on Jimmy Norton.  There have been things we have done on this show I'm just waiting for bat phones to go off like crazy.  And I look behind me and go, we can't get away with this. 
[00:20:00]  And this is all you hear.  Nothing.  That's what you hear from the manager's office.  Nothing.  That's it.  Oh, this just in from XM Washington.  All right.  We'll keep talking about it.  Doesn't seem to be a problem.  Oh, my God.  I will have to call that statement hogwash.  I am calling Bravo Sierra.  Bravo Sierra.  It's stronger.  One notch up from hogwash.  I know that's the corporate's job to look responsible. 
[00:20:30]  Of course it is.  But the reality is we have done some horrific things on this brand new show.  They want to be able to go.  Yeah.  Hi, General Motors?  Yeah, XM.  No, no.  There are restrictions in place on those boys.  Don't worry about it.  Sell those vehicles with the XM in there and you don't have to worry about anything.  Thank you.  There you go.  And then the reality is, you know, make a little joke about an Amber Alert or something. 
[00:21:00]  And here's the response from DC.  Hello?  Help.  Help.  All right.  It's fine, I guess.  Keep up the good job, boys.  That's what I hear every day.  I get an email in my box every day about how the show ruled.  That's right.  That's all I hear.  That's all I care about.  I don't hear this.  Ever.  No.  No mouth trap here.  No, absolutely not.  Anyway.  Good old Howie was at it on Friday, and thanks to one of our pests, here it is. 
[00:21:30]  I was watching private parts last night on VH1, and old XM tried to pull a slick one on you  and have a couple spots within the mix there.  XM is a really strange company, I'll tell you.  By strange, if you're profitable, successful, growing at a faster rate than you, then I guess  it's strange.  No, they're a smarter company, Howard. 
[00:22:00]  That might have been what he meant.  They're a smarter company.  They know a lot of potential satellite radio people are going to be watching your stupid movie,  so of course you advertise on that.  Of course you do.  So, that's how it works.  And it worked perfectly, because now you've got a guy calling up your show to talk about  our company, because they saw the commercial during your fucking movie.  It worked perfectly for our company.  It worked.  Oh, it's not pretty, but it worked perfectly, didn't it, Howie? 
[00:22:30]  They think that kind of stuff gets to either me or to the company, and you've got to understand  something.  It only highlights what we have going on around here.  You know, it's so funny, when we were doing our farewell show with thousands of people.  All right.  I haven't heard this yet.  Yeah.  And I swear to you, I did not hear this yet.  Okay?  And I know he's going to take a shot at us, obviously, or the pest wouldn't have sent this  in.  Yeah.  When Howie did his farewell show on K-Rock, you know, his last show on commercial radio, 
[00:23:00]  we decided to get under his skin.  Absolutely.  Yeah.  We had hundreds and hundreds of our pests show up at the fucking event and cause holy  hell.  Yeah.  We got signage on the moving trucks that he hired.  We got signage all over the subway stops.  Anything that had a sign, we had our logo, XM logo, Opie and Anthony, WOW stickers.  Every shot that was on the news that night, you saw an O&A sign somewhere in the crowd. 
[00:23:30]  Absolutely.  Now, let me tell you why we did that.  One, yes, to get publicity for our show.  Because we're publicity whores.  Absolutely.  Yes.  And the other thing, which is just as important, to get under that fucking asshole's skin.  Yeah.  And I guarantee you, I know for a fact, we got under his skin and we wrecked his cute  little day.  There's video of it.  We wrecked his fucking day.  There's video of it when his bus turns the corner and his crowd dwindles to pretty much 
[00:24:00]  nothing because they were all in one area to watch him give his little speech.  And then he hopped on a bus and I guess he was expecting the Broadway to just be lined  with fans the whole way down to the Hard Rock Cafe.  It just wasn't the case.  The second that bus turned off of the initial road that he was on, the crowd dwindled to  barely anything.  To nothing.  And all it was, was a sidewalk full of O&A signs and fans holding up their signs. 
[00:24:30]  And he had to turn his head as to not acknowledge it.  It was obvious.  He saw it.  He knew what it was all about.  We didn't have our people in place and we wrecked his fucking day.  It ain't 95 anymore.  It's not 1992 anymore.  It's not a book signing with 25,000 people showing up.  Yeah, there were a lot of people down there where he was giving a speech. 
[00:25:00]  It weren't the old days.  That's for sure.  And you sure know that, Howie.  And we accomplished exactly what we wanted to that day.  Get under your skin and get some promotion for us, Opie and Anthony.  Even one of our guys ended up on the local news here in New York.  Yep.  So they had to talk about Opie and Anthony on the news and XM.  So we accomplished what we wanted to do.  Let's hear what he has to say about this.  I understand something.  It only highlights what we have going on around here.  You know, it's so funny.  When we were doing our farewell show with thousands of people in the street, I kind of felt, and 
[00:25:30]  this is going to sound weird to say, but I felt bad for Opie and Anthony.  I mean, I honestly felt their desperation in trying.  Dude, you're such a fucking liar.  Oh.  As soon as you saw that crowd of Opie and Anthony fans, which was a huge fucking crowd for your  fucking event, your face, even though you've had a facelift, basically, was melting.  You were so pissed off.  All that work you had done started, you know, you started having a droopy face. 
[00:26:00]  You were so bummed out.  And maybe you should spend...  That would rain down your fucking parade.  Maybe you should spend a little less time feeling sorry for us and thinking about your  own show.  We've been here.  We've been on satellite radio for almost a year and a half, doing very well, very successful,  this program for XM.  We're doing fine, Howie.  You're the one that has a lot to prove, and initial reports coming in, it ain't quite working  out as to the hype that was put out. 
[00:26:30]  And as far as feeling sorry for people, I think we were jumping on the, we feel sorry  for Howie bandwagon before you were feeling sorry for us.  It's a little more...  You know something?  It's a little easier to feel sorry for a guy that had upwards of 10 million listeners  nationwide.  Go to a company that has 3 million listeners total. 
[00:27:00]  And believe me, if 10% of them are tuned into you at any given moment, you're lucky.  Which would be a huge number, by the way.  Which would be a huge number.  If they had 3 million listeners, 10% tuning into Howie would be a huge number.  This isn't bullshit.  This is the way it is.  So don't feel sorry for us.  We're fine over here.  It's a fact that we're talking to more people than Howard Stern right now.  Yeah.  It's an absolute fact.  Yep. 
[00:27:30]  Absolute fact.  So don't, please don't feel sorry for us.  Take that time and energy to maybe do a show and not feel sorry for us.  I kind of felt, and this is going to sound weird to say, but I felt bad for Opie and  Anthony.  I mean, I honestly felt their desperation in trying to get...  We talked about that.  Yeah, I mean, you know, they blew their career.  Before they actually got big, they, you know, that's probably, they would have had a big  career, but they really screwed up big time because they're desperate guys.  I mean, they're so desperate to be famous. 
[00:28:00]  So they showed they had like 10 or 20 fans show up with signs.  I hear they're losing channels.  Yeah, they had some, they had some signs and stuff.  Everyone just kind of looked at each other and said, this is so sad.  They want to be, they kind of want to tie in with us in a weird way.  Well, everywhere you win, they tried to be there.  Yeah, it was kind of weird.  And XM, similarly, like buying some ads during private parts, like I know they think that  like irks someone or it's going to maybe like, wow, we really got them.  It looks desperate. 
[00:28:30]  We did get to.  You're talking about, you idiot.  Yeah, that's how it works.  At the same time, there was only 20 Opie and Anthony fans there.  You're just not being honest once again, Howie.  Yeah.  Once again.  Wow.  We wrecked our careers.  I think our careers are just fine.  We're doing just fine.  We took it a little different path than we thought we would, but we're doing fine.  We had to go into rebuild mode.  We didn't know we were going to get fired.  You know, he's right there.  That career blew up. 
[00:29:00]  The terrestrial radio career, for the time being.  We'll see what happens.  But, you know, we're on a different path than we thought we were going to be when we were  on terrestrial radio, but no less gooder.  I'll tell you that.  It is a hell of a lot easier mentally to come in here on a daily basis and be able to talk  about anything we want than it was on terrestrial.  All right. 
[00:29:30]  Let's move on to the next little thing here.  XM's going to really have to figure out a way to market themselves now because they see  what's happening.  XM had a chance to be the only.  You know what?  They talk about the amount of money I was paid to come to Sirius.  If XM had been brilliant, they would have stopped at nothing to get me over there.  But they were wise asses.  They really thought that I'd go with them because they were the leader, so to speak.  They had the jump on Sirius.  Did they really thought?  Did you realize the game would have been over? 
[00:30:00]  Had they signed it, they would have had the biggest Christmas.  Sirius would have run flat.  And they would have had the whole ballgame.  There'd be no second satellite.  Sirius might have been forced out of business.  That's right.  Yeah.  They would be approaching nine million listeners.  That's right.  At this point.  Possibly more.  And the fact of the matter is that.  Wrong.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Wrong.  Fucking numbers, man.  And they love twisting these numbers around.  Approaching nine million because, and there's the logic.  We have six. 
[00:30:30]  They have three.  So they're saying if Stern came here, XM would have nine because you could take the three that Sirius had.  Because everyone on Sirius subscribed for Howard, right?  No.  That's just false.  It's the rate of growth that Sirius had over the course of the years that they've been in business.  Everyone that subscribes to Sirius isn't subscribing to Howard.  They make it sound like they came on and then every subscription that came in for Sirius was due to Howard. 
[00:31:00]  It's not the case.  That would be, why then cannot we say, we have been on, there were how many people when we signed on?  Over two million?  Two million.  There are now six million.  Opie, we are responsible for four million listeners signing up.  Almost four million listeners.  So if we went to Sirius, they would have had seven million people.  Seven million subscribers. 
[00:31:30]  No.  It doesn't work that way, Howie.  You're not responsible for everyone that's over there.  Some people just want to hear fucking 70s music.  Some people want to hear classic rock.  Some people want to hear whatever else is going on over there.  Not listening to you.  Not everyone's listening to you.  Like we said, if it's 10%, you're lucky.  The matter is that their arrogance is incredible.  And when I met with them, they were a little bit arrogant. 
[00:32:00]  And I said to them, you don't understand.  I'm not even sure I want to go back into radio.  And this Sirius came in.  They were a little arrogant.  How smart were they not to pay you over a half a billion dollars for a has-been?  For a fucking has-been.  Yeah, that's right, Howard.  A has-been.  Maybe you were worth that much.  Maybe in 92.  Maybe.  A half a billion dollars.  Infinity wasn't even willing to pay that.  Back then at your peak.  When you were peaking, they weren't. 
[00:32:30]  The move of desperation.  That desperation that you talk about is Sirius Satellite Radio putting all their eggs and their money in one basket.  You.  And it's failing.  It's failing, asshole.  It ain't even working out for you.  Or the company.  It's not arrogance.  It was smart.  It was intelligence.  It's looking at a product and saying, you know something?  This product, Howard Stern, that product is worth this much.  You're not going to pressure us into paying that much. 
[00:33:00]  Go to the stupid company that's hemorrhaging cash and go for your payday over there.  Do your lousy has-been old hat show over there for a half a billion dollars.  It ain't going to work here.  You want to call that arrogance?  I call it a smart business move.  And when are you going to break it to your listeners that you're only going to do four days a week?  They're going to be real happy when they find that's part of your deal.  Yeah, how about that one?  Howie.  But Mel basically begged you not to do that yet until the company gets moving a little forward. 
[00:33:30]  Until maybe some good reviews come in?  When are you going to break it to your audience that you're only going to do four days a week  and you're only doing about nine months of radio a year?  When do you drop that little secret on your fans?  Half a billion dollars and you expect it to waltz into XM just because your name is Howard Stern  and you were huge back in the early 90s that XM was going to just open the checkbook like Sirius did  and pay you a half a billion dollars? 
[00:34:00]  You call that arrogance?  That's a smart business move.  It's a smart business move.  That's what XM does.  They don't put all their eggs in one basket.  Would we love Opie, would we have loved for XM to make the entire platform built around Opie and Anthony?  Of course.  Where nothing but Opie and Anthony commercials.  Of course.  It's a great ego boost.  But as far as business goes, quite frankly, there are plenty of people around this country 
[00:34:30]  who could give a flying fuck who Opie and Anthony are.  They don't know who Opie and Anthony are.  They're not going to buy XM because Opie and Anthony is on it.  And the same thing goes for you, Howard.  You have the name, yeah.  But a lot of people just don't give a shit.  And they're not going to subscribe to Sirius just because you're there.  And we're talking the majority of people in the country.  And the funny thing is, Howard really, really wanted to come to XM.  But they weren't willing to pay.  Not going to pay.  So you went for the payday.  Congratulations on that.  That's it. 
[00:35:00]  But you know damn well the little doggy company is light years behind XM.  You know that.  Look at the technology end of it.  You absolutely know that.  And you're bitter.  You're bitter that they didn't open up their pocketbooks.  You got all the money, but you're with the Lemon Company.  With shit equipment that people have to deal with.  You don't even have a portable unit that gets live friggin' radio.  You can't even really do channel blocking.  And that's why the fucking government is coming after your little company.  Yeah.  And that's why you're going to have to be censored, you ass. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah.  And this Sirius came in and said, we want you.  And here's what we need to do.  Because they were desperate.  And XM nice guys.  I mean, they're not bad people.  They're trying their best.  But they really don't step up to the plate.  This is the second go-around I had with them.  And they just don't step up.  They just miss.  You know, buying an ad in private parts is fine.  I don't care either way.  I don't think it's going to sell one radio for them.  I think they think it bothers me in some weird way.  And I've got to tell you something.  It doesn't.  It doesn't bother me at all. 
[00:36:00]  We've been surprisingly unbothered by anything.  Terrestrial Radio, the other satellite company.  We're just happy to be here.  Yeah, keep telling yourselves that.  That it doesn't bother you.  I just spent 20 minutes on your show talking about how it doesn't bother you.  How it doesn't bother you.  It doesn't bother me.  They think in some weird way it's going to bother me, Robin.  Bother you.  We know for a fact that shit bothers you.  It does bother him.  That's why we do it.  And it's a game to us.  We love getting under this guy's skin.  And it's a smart move business-wise to put a commercial. 
[00:36:30]  Everyone, it's been in the press all over the place that Howard is going to satellite.  Truth of the matter is there are still people confused as to where he went, is going.  People don't even know.  There are people out there that have no idea satellite exists.  They have no idea there's two companies.  They have no idea these things.  Those people will look at an XM satellite radio ad during Howard's thing where you're going  to get a lot of people maybe interested in buying satellite radio and see an ad for XM satellite radio. 
[00:37:00]  When they go to a Best Buy or something, they're going to go, hey, I want that XM.  There you go.  It worked.  One subscription.  It's just, that's how successful marketing is done.  You look for, you look to market to the people that are out there that are going to buy this.  Absolutely.  And the people that are watching private parts are probably of the demo that will be buying satellite radio. 
[00:37:30]  And not all will buy for Howie.  Yeah.  So we'll take our little piece.  And continue to be the leaders, by the way.  There you go.  You got one more good quarter ahead of you, Howie, and then watch the numbers.  And when those new units pop in the stores, holy shit, they're coming out in March.  And believe me, I am the last thing.  I am not a company man.  Believe me.  They tell me about shit and I forget about it the next day. 
[00:38:00]  I have no idea.  I've seen these things.  I've used them.  They are amazing.  At CES.  They're tiny.  Amazing.  And Sirius keeps trying to push the fact that they have these units and they lie to their people.  They lie.  They try to present it in an ad through this double talk that it is an actual on-the-go satellite receiver that you can take with you and listen to live programming.  It isn't.  They do not have one of those. 
[00:38:30]  They don't have one on the horizon.  It's not.  While we have already had one, the MiFi, this newer one is so small.  It's the size of a goddamn phone.  It's smaller.  It's like a credit card.  And it records MP3s.  And you know how we got that done, by the way?  By not wasting the money on one show.  How about you take a half a billion dollars and put it in research and development for new equipment? 
[00:39:00]  Instead of outsourcing your technology, how about you have your own people that are dedicated to the company, that come up with new ways and new things and new products?  That's what XM did.  Is that the smart move or is that stupid, Howard?  Is that arrogant or is that the smart move?  I see it as the smart move.  People are walking the streets of major cities and listening to the Opie and Anthony show live through ear pods like an iPod. 
[00:39:30]  And they need a goddamn refrigerator to listen to the Howard Stern show.  Is that really arrogant that they didn't pick you up, Howard?  Well, Howard?  Is it Howard really?  Or does it just makes good business sense?  Yeah.  You ass. 
[00:40:00]  Everything he said translates in.  Everything he's called arrogant, stupid, trying to get to him.  Everything is good business sense.  If you just ask, maybe Barron's Magazine, one of the premier Wall Street magazines that say, don't bet on Howard, right on the cover.  Perhaps they know a little more about good business.  All right.  There's a mad scramble to capture my audience.  And the delusion of XM thinking that putting an ad on private parts makes a difference to me. 
[00:40:30]  Well, I thought it didn't bother you.  You're still talking about it.  It didn't bother him.  And the truth of the matter is, it really isn't just about getting to you, Howard.  It's smart business.  It's not always about you, idiot.  Okay?  Putting an ad on private parts makes a difference to me.  It's ludicrous.  They've got to develop their own identity now.  They can't merely react to what I'm doing.  Wherever I go, panging up a sign, it looks sad.  It ain't about me.  You've got to go out and sell subscriptions and get people to listen. 
[00:41:00]  Which XM is doing?  How about two to one blowing you away?  Shut up.  We're still a two to one lead.  We're doing it.  Of course your stupid company was going to have a hot quarter because you were coming aboard.  We understand that.  But you know where it goes from there?  It goes down from there.  Don't people understand they had a big quarter?  I know this is a ridiculous business talk.  Their quarter was big around Christmas.  Because Howard for 14 months was promoting the fact that he was going to Sirius after Christmas. 
[00:41:30]  So their Christmas shopping in quarter was huge because, yes, the guy has a huge fan base on terrestrial radio.  And the fact is we made our number as well.  Right.  So we're doing exactly what we needed to do as a company.  Yeah.  It didn't hurt XM.  It didn't hurt XM.  There was nothing.  No listeners ran away from subscribing to XM because Howie went to Sirius.  His hardcore fans that were listening to him on terrestrial bought and that pushed the numbers up. 
[00:42:00]  Now, where do you go from there?  Is the next quarter just as big from people going, oh, Howard's there?  Let me buy again.  Well, no.  But the reality is they'll probably have another good quarter.  Definitely.  It ain't going to be as big as the Christmas quarter.  Absolutely not.  And my point is it goes down from there as opposed to XM and this program, which has done nothing but build and build over the time we've been on. 
[00:42:30]  Because when we're not doing this, we do a show.  Right.  And we will.  That people want to listen to.  And they tell their friends and more people subscribe.  And the reality is we're still the leader in this fine forum.  Right.  We're still the leader.  XM is still way ahead of the little doggy company.  So we're doing our job over here.  Let them scramble to try to figure out how to pay.  It ain't about me.  You've got to go out and sell subscriptions and get people to listen. 
[00:43:00]  Which we're doing.  I'm not the guy.  I mean, you want to sit there and put ads on private parts.  Wow.  You really rocked me.  Let me tell you, I almost couldn't sleep.  Still talking about it, Howard.  All you have to do is take one psychology class in college to realize that we absolutely got under your skin.  Of course.  Couldn't sleep because when I heard that, it kept you up.  You've got to understand what a compliment that is to me. 
[00:43:30]  Well, you know, the sad thing is Opie and Anthony got another radio show.  They wouldn't have known what...  Why is that sad, Robin?  Why is she said something about...  It's sad that we got another radio show?  Why?  Yeah, it's a lot sadder than me being in an attic putting tin in going, I used to be Anthony.  Now, I'd give them that, would be sad.  I was only a few months away from calling up the old Huntington Crescent Club and said,  Hey, I could be one of those old caddies I saw when I was caddying over there. 
[00:44:00]  I still remember what the yardage is.  You fucking hole.  Well, is Opie and Anthony got another radio show.  They wouldn't have known what to do with satellite coming to it first because you had not done it yet.  Right.  And now that you have shown...  Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  She's got to finish.  I know.  I'm building up, too.  I got to hear this.  Holy shit, I got to hear this.  She is the...  Wait a minute.  She is the luckiest broadcaster in radio. 
[00:44:30]  Am I getting...  The luckiest broadcaster in radio.  Am I getting the feeling?  She's saying we've been here almost a year and a half and we haven't known what to do until how it's come on.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Holy shit.  Our body of work speaks for itself.  That's all I'll say.  We don't need to try to defend ourselves.  We've had a great year and three months.  Oh, welcome to the show, by the way.  Patrice, by the way, you could have just come in, you know, an hour.  You could have slept a little late.  And I want to apologize. 
[00:45:00]  I really want to go out on a sofa and take a nap.  But I don't want to...  We're almost done.  I want to apologize for the racial epithets that were flinging through my mind two seconds ago.  And it almost came out of my mouth.  It almost came out of my mouth, the big one.  It was the nuclear N-word.  Almost popped out.  Followed by the C-word.  Oh, my God.  I swear to you, it was right at the tip of my tongue, and I held back.  She's the luckiest person in broadcasting.  She adds absolutely nothing to his stupid show. 
[00:45:30]  She was there in the beginning because it allowed Howard to talk about blacks and this and that a lot easier.  But now that that shit doesn't matter anymore, she still gets to sit on that show.  She's a big, fat, black-assed albatross.  That's what you are.  A big, fat, black marshmallow.  Sit in your little booth.  Sit in your dunking booth.  Some people could call me that. 
[00:46:00]  And chime in.  But you're charming.  Sit in your dunking booth and read the headlines.  That's your job.  That's your job.  Chime in.  Reiterate what Howie says with a little chuckle.  The sad thing is, Opie and Anthony got another radio show.  They wouldn't have known what to do with satellite coming to it first because you had not done it yet.  Right.  And now that you have shown them how to generate publicity, they just show up to try to grab some of it. 
[00:46:30]  It's sad.  What are you talking about?  That didn't even really make sense.  What is she fucking talking about?  Wow.  Wow.  I just hope that the people hear the dishonesty in this stupid radio show.  That's all.  That's arrogance.  That's why we go off on these little tangents and go after these people because they're so fucking dishonest.  When we signed with XM, we got all the headlines. 
[00:47:00]  Trust me.  Yeah.  We got all the headlines.  Don't worry so much about us, you fucking hole.  We had national interviews on all the hot shows.  We were in every fucking magazine.  We were on the front page of a bunch of newspapers.  We got it all as well.  Don't worry about it.  For you to say that we had to wait for Howard to make his announcement so he could show us how it's done is such bullshit.  We sat here over a year.  That's such dishonesty.  Over a year, we sat here, me and Opie shaking, going, I can't wait. 
[00:47:30]  When, when will Howie be on Opie to show us?  And we continue to generate our own headlines and our own stories in the newspapers.  Yeah, don't worry about the way we get publicity.  Matter of fact, we're doing an interview for the Daily News tomorrow.  A big feature.  Don't worry about it.  Tomorrow.  A little paper in here in New York City called the Daily News.  Thank you very much.  A big, huge feature.  We're doing that tomorrow.  And if you look at our career from day one, I think we know how to get publicity. 
[00:48:00]  They're just fucking dishonest.  Yeah.  Just babbling assholes.  It's sad.  And what's even sadder is Terrestrial Radio's reaction to me leaving.  All this carrying on just makes me bigger and bigger and bigger.  I'm telling you, your plan is to make me bigger.  We've got momentum.  We've got something going on.  You actually have a plan about you and there's nobody else mentioned. 
[00:48:30]  You know, we have to get on this show or that show.  No.  You have a plan to roll out information when it's good for you.  The whole speaks again and I just throw my arms up and go, what?  All I hear is Charlie Brown's teacher.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  That's right, Rob.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Well, that's exactly my point and what I was saying.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.  Ah, shut up, hole.  Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah. 
[00:49:00]  Do you think she eats like a pig to cover up the fact that she has no talent in radio?  Yeah.  And it bothers her that she's, you know, cashing that paycheck every night?  Nerve-wracked.  She's nerve-wracked.  She's like, holy shit, they're not on to me yet?  Yeah.  I could cash a few more checks.  All I have to do is chuckle at what Howard says and, uh...  Sit in my dunking booth.  Repeat what he says with different words.  And rip and read.  And rip and read.  Rip and read.  And then, yeah.  Just read a bunch of stuff. 
[00:49:30]  Ugh.  One more quick clip and we'll move on.  Still at it.  A real radio show today.  Well, they have a very bad problem over at XM because, listen, I'm privy to this stuff.  They have a board of directors that rides their ass whenever they want to make a decision.  They are paralyzed.  You, Pinero, very badly wanted to hire me.  But he couldn't convince that board to move fast enough.  I believe so.  And it's not his fault.  And, listen, I was looking...  Hey, keeping that door open, aren't you, Howie?  Howie, keeping that fucking door open, aren't you? 
[00:50:00]  Keeping that XM door open.  And that sounds like confidence and faith in your half-a-billion-dollar paycheck-giving company.  Hey, thank you, Pinero.  I like that guy.  He's great.  Keep the door open.  Don't burn this bridge, idiot.  There's only two satellite companies.  Don't burn this bridge.  Good Howie.  Sounds like a guy that's a little bitter that he didn't get to go to the better company.  The better company.  And a little insecure that if something happens over there, he'll be able to jump ship. 
[00:50:30]  Yeah.  That's what that sounds like to me.  Yeah, because when your contract's up, XM's going to want to hire a 60-year-old shock jock.  Can I throw bologna at your tits?  I don't think so.  Ew, stop it.  You're creepy.  I don't think so.  Paul, and listen, I was looking at every aspect when you're making a move to sign.  My aspect to me is a dollar.  Not just, you know, will they pay me.  I was looking at, you know, how fast they crank out radios, what their commitment is to programming.  What?  No, you're not. 
[00:51:00]  You looked at the money.  You looked at the money.  Shut up.  You looked at the money.  Every other aspect of these companies.  One company wanted to pay you half a billion dollars.  The other one didn't.  That's it.  That's it.  XM, every other part of XM works out on paper better than serious.  Everything.  Their financials, the technology, the management, everything works out better.  And don't take our word for it.  Read the latest issue of Barron's. 
[00:51:30]  Barron's, you know, that little-known publication that covers Wall Street.  Barron's.  You idiot.  The guy is a lying sack of cunt.  That's what you are.  You lied.  I got to dump out of that.  We got to censor ourselves.  Oh, dump out.  We better censor that.  We're over the line here.  We don't have channel blocking, so we better believe that we have responsibility here at our company.  Not just, you know, will they pay me. 
[00:52:00]  I was looking at, you know, how fast they crank out radios, what their commitment is to programming and all that stuff.  XM's not a bad company.  It's just, for me, this was a better company.  This was the place for me.  For you.  It just seems lazy to me to just rely on commercial-free music as your selling point.  Or the Ellen Show.  Right.  I mean, what's that?  And then even the Snoop Channel is a reaction to the Eminem Show.  What an asshole.  They're, like, trying to, like, knock us down because we have Ellen DeGeneres and Snoop. 
[00:52:30]  They have Martha Stewart and Eminem.  And it's called Variety.  And Eminem doesn't even do anything.  They just hire his fucking name.  His name.  And it's called Variety because, Howie, not everyone is listening to Howard Stern.  Sorry.  And you know something?  Some people will tune in and listen to Ellen.  Big Ellen fans will tune in and listen to Ellen.  As will they listen to that old, raggedy, convict bitch Martha Stewart over there on your company. 
[00:53:00]  People will listen to that.  It's just the way it is.  But Ellen...  It's part of the beauty of satellite is that it's not all about one guy.  And Ellen trumps Martha Stewart every time.  Oh, stop.  Every fucking time.  It's whatever.  You know, it's just not all about you.  And this guy thinks it's all about him.  What's that?  And then even the Snoop channel is a reaction to the Eminem channel, which is a brilliant move.  But that's what I'm saying.  All they did was come out and say we're commercial free. 
[00:53:30]  Shut up.  And everything else has been a reaction to whatever else has gone on.  So, you mean, you know, don't just imitate.  Initiate something new.  Oh, don't just do it.  And that will be the secret to success.  What?  And, you know, we'll see what happens.  So, when we make our next announcement, you'll say that we took your advice, right, Howie?  Yeah.  Wait till you hear what XM does next.  Wait till you hear what XM does next. 
[00:54:00]  Wait till you hear what XM does next.  There it was.  Your dose of insincerity, dishonesty, lying, with a little fat, fat black ass hole thrown in for measure.  Mm-hmm.  It's just getting larger and larger and larger.  You are getting so fucking fat.  Ugh.  Ugh.  Ugh. 
[00:54:30]  And Howie's a lying sack.  Of what?  Lying sack of a cunt.  He is.  Better dump out of that.  Just dump, please.  There's no sincerity there.  No honesty.  The guy, and you know something?  I feel sorry for him.  Because he's not even being honest with himself.  I sincerely believe, I think he believes all this shit to make himself feel better so he can sleep at night.  And he's not even talking to 10% of his old audience. 
[00:55:00]  Not even 10% of his old audience.  Nope.  And they'll have another pretty good quarter.  And then what?  And then what?  Wah, wah, wah, wah.  And then what?  Oh, I'm sorry.  Ooh.  And then everyone starts looking at you going, we're paying you this much for what?  For what?  I like the way the whole tried to twist the fact that even though we were here over a year on satellite radio, over a year before Howard hit satellite, that somehow even our satellite show is ripping him off. 
[00:55:30]  Right.  How the hell do you spin?  That's amazing, isn't it?  How do you spin that one?  That's amazing.  They have a time machine, Robin.  They took it to the future.  And a little secret.  Listen to my show.  And a little secret about our contract.  Unfortunately, we're on a year-to-year basis.  Mm-hmm.  So if we were not successful once again in our first year, XM would have easily said goodbye. 
[00:56:00]  Boot.  Save the money.  Spend it on something else.  The boot.  They would have absolutely given us the boot.  The threat of the boot is there.  We have to perform.  We need to perform.  We need to please the audience.  That's right.  We don't have that cushy contract.  They were scared shitless hiring us.  Who wouldn't be?  That's why in all our interviews.  In a church.  That's why.  Assholes.  That's why in all our interviews we talk about how we still have passion to do this.  Right.  And, you know, Howard's become lazy, which is just a fact. 
[00:56:30]  We have passion to eat.  That's right.  That's the real passion.  That's the passion.  Food and shelter.  That's our motivation.  They pretty much tell us every Friday if they're going to pick up the next week of our contract.  So we call that passion.  That's passion.  Not as am I going to be able to afford fuel for the helicopter out to the Hamptons that weekend.  That isn't passion.  But we like to spin it and call it passion.  My passion is, in a year, am I going to have a couch with duct tape on the arm again? 
[00:57:00]  The fact is, we have no choice.  We have to put on a great radio show every fucking day.  Every day.  It's the passion to eat.  We can't rest one day at this new job.  They can fire us tomorrow.  And not have a problem with it.  And we'll just be a blink, blink in the satellite radio.  That's it.  Business.  That's what our passion is.  But thank the good Lord.  We're doing just fine over here. 
[00:57:30]  Thank you very much.  All right.  We're going to start our radio show next.  Patrice O'Neill is here.  And we couldn't be happier.  We've got lots to talk about today.  Just walked in the door, Patrice.  Slept a little late.  What's been going on?  Nothing.  Just talking about the radio shows, things like that.  Nothing you'd want to get involved in.  But, you know, instead of maybe hearing some bitterness in our voices today,  why don't you just pick up the latest issue of Barron's.  Barron's. 
[00:58:00]  Because we back up the shit we say on our show with cold, hard facts.  I believe it's available online, too, complete with the graphs and pie charts.  Yeah, look how impressive the pie charts are.  I was very impressed by the pie charts.  There were some big words in the Barron's article, so I just went to the charts.  And I saw that XM had a much bigger piece of the pie.  They were blue.  They were colored blue.  And then I think the serious was the red.  And the blue was bigger.  The blue was bigger and it had a dollop of whipped cream on top. 
[00:58:30]  All right.  A couple of radio teases because we love radio teases.  I got a couple.  And had a moment watching Web Junk 20.  Yes.  Patrice McNeil's new show on VH1.  Love the show.  Don't even say.  I'm not just kissing ass over here.  I love the show.  Don't even say what happened.  You're very funny on there.  It's just like the video clips are what they are.  I've seen some of them online.  But Patrice's comments are very funny.  That's right.  And we'll get into what happened as Anthony was watching Web Junk 20. 
[00:59:00]  Yes.  And I guess we've got to play a little game called, guess which member of the Opie and  Anthony show went and saw Brokeback Mountain on their own?  Oh, yeah.  This is difficult.  Guess which member went and saw Brokeback Mountain?  Actually went.  Went.  Actually went to the movie theater and said, I am going to see that movie.  Brokeback by the faggot cowboy movie.  That's the one I want to see. 
[00:59:30]  Excuse me, sir.  One ticket to the faggot cowboy movie?  Thank you.  No, I don't want to give to the children.  No, I don't want to see Munich.  No, I don't want to see Scarlett Johansson and Match Point.  Don't hand me 18 advertisements I have to throw away, too.  I need one ticket to the faggot cowboy movie.  When I go to the movies, they give you the ticket and then they give you, like, I don't  know, advertisements for the snack bar.  Coupons.  It's like, believe me, I'm walking up to it.  Coupons.  I know where it is.  I know it's available there. 
[01:00:00]  Right.  It's not like, oh, I could get a Buick.  All right.  You know, it's a snack bar.  Give me some Twizzlers.  All right.  We'll take a break and we'll continue with some of these teases and some other things.  Got to talk about Kobe scoring 81 points last night.  Oh, and I hit my OnStar emergency button over the weekend.  You did?  Yes, I did.  I'll talk about that.  After these words.  And Howard's feeling very sorry for Ant and I as we proceed to buy nice places of residence 
[01:00:30]  for ourselves.  Oh, goodness.  I was shopping for a home in Manhattan over the weekend and had something.  Were you house shopping?  I had something a little crazy happen to me as well.  Look at all these teases.  These are just teasing.  We are teasing.  You're not supposed to tease on satellite.  Didn't Howie teach you that?  But Howie continues to feel sorry for us.  By the way, Howard, we'll continue to be wherever you're at, under your fucking skin.  Yep.  He's trying to use reverse psychology with the whole, I feel sorry for these guys. 
[01:01:00]  No, we know it gets to you.  We know it's easy to get under your skin and we will continue.  Our pests will continue to do that.  Not as easy as it used to be to get under his skin because it's a little tighter now.  A little tighter now, right, because that's what you want in your shock jock, a facelift.  That's just brilliant.  Didn't he used to goof?  Who was it he used to goof on?  Scott Shannon.  Scott Shannon.  Holy shit.  Pull the audio of that one, kids.  The Scott Shannon facelift rants that Howard used to go on. 
[01:01:30]  He's him now.  What sets him apart from what he was goofing on about Scott Shannon, that Scott Shannon went  in and got a facelift.  Yeah, I've got a facelift.  What do you think?  I remember listening to that.  We know for a fact he has a new nose, a new neck.  It was told to us we can't confirm this.  Get a new show!  We can't confirm this, but he adds hair all the fucking time.  Yeah.  And he pretty much has to go to a parlor to get his hair done.  Ha, ha, ha.  Howard. 
[01:02:00]  No?  Chia pet?  Yeah.  That was good.  I stink.  Feel sorry for me.  All right, we'll end this segment with Howard Stern talking about the number one satellite  radio company in America.

[01:03:00]  Hardware and required subscriptions sold separately.  All right, here we go.  All right, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony program.  Patrice O'Neill in studio today.  Good morning.  We have lots to do on the program today.  I guess we're doing a three-hour show today, technically.  Sorry about that.  But we have to go down that road from time to time.  You got to bear with us.  Some things must be pointed out, collected, and then pointed out, that's all.  Because this fucking asshole is not going to be walking over us, ever. 
[01:03:30]  Nope.  We've been fighting the battle for many years, and we've been very successful.  Very successful.  Remind me, we got to talk about Cindy Adams, that pig in the New York Post.  She went to Scores as a cocktail waitress, wearing a wacky wig, thinking she's, I don't  know, some kind of hipster, and then has all sorts of comments about the strip club, and  her humor is just unbelievable.  It's just the best humor I've ever read in a newspaper. 
[01:04:00]  Always funny and cutting edge.  A couple things, some business.  My brother's restaurant will be opening within a week, it looks like.  Really?  Yes.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington.  F.H.  Riley's.  Is that what it's going to be called?  F.H.  Riley's, yes.  Nice.  Go ahead, why are you making fun of the name?  No, I just, I want to go to the grand opening and order my fucking roast beef and potatoes  and my boiled cabbage stew at the fucking F.H.  Riley's and shit. 
[01:04:30]  Fuck, man, you know, we're not Irish, but we'll fucking jump on the Irish bandwagon.  Why not?  Why not?  That's the, you know, that's the type of names that do well in the old bar and restaurant  business.  That's true.  Actually, F.H. is the initials of my late great dad, Fred Hughes, and Riley's, the name  of one of my nieces.  So there you go.  Ah.  F.H.  Riley's.  F.H.  Riley's.  400 New York Avenue in Huntington.  We're going to be open for business any day.  That sounds like a fun place.  It actually is going to be a lot of fun.  I like the name.  F.H. 
[01:05:00]  You want to go down to Riley's?  Well, after the explanation of the name, it's like you can't even joke no more.  Oh, you can joke?  Thanks a lot, Obi, for fucking it.  It's my dad and my niece.  It's like, thank you, beloved family members.  I can't even, like, trash it now.  Yes, you can.  You can do whatever you want.  Dude, trust me.  If you want to trash, trash.  Look at the big business on St. Paddy's Day, I guess, huh?  Yeah, definitely.  You've got to get open before that with a name like F.H.  Riley's.  You've got to be open on St. Paddy's Day.  Yeah, we need to pay some bills, so we've got to be open on St. Paddy's Day. 
[01:05:30]  You should just change it.  Then, like, Cinco de Mayo, it's Jose's.  Right.  You just have a rotating sign for every occasion.  F.H. Jose's.  What, um...  And for Black History Month, I don't know.  What memorabilia is going to be on the wall?  We'll get some fucking snowshoes and a couple of...  Yeah, what do you got planned for the decor?  I think there may be a picture or two of you and I.  Oh!  There may be a little Opie and Anthony section.  The celebrity signing section.  Yeah.  We're going to turn it to the place to hang if you're like a pest of this radio show. 
[01:06:00]  Absolutely.  That's good.  And we'll be there, uh...  Well, I'll be there very often.  Can I make a bet on the first drunk that's thrown out of there and not allowed back?  Yeah.  All right.  You know what my bet is.  And, uh...  She'll be using my money.  No, her picture will be at the door.  She's not allowed in.  Not allowed in?  No.  Why can't I get into this fucking place?  have a little six-piece riley fingers some oh yeah now my brother's an amazing chef he's been

[01:11:30]  eleven thousand friends yeah patrice and i i call rendition patrice and i decided to take our little  thing to the next level you were trying to make friends if there's a friendship don't ever call me  again that's all i gotta say we are radio friends wait a minute you started sick you started by  leaving a very awkward message that i still have on my phone inviting me to the nick game no i didn't  leave it i'd text it because this cocksucker doesn't call you back so and then when he calls you 
[01:12:00]  can tell it's a time where you should be very excited that he called like yeah like it should  be a drum roll right before the calling  it's op calling you you better pick up motherfucking right now yeah so we're talking i invited him to the  basketball game we had an extra ticket front row i know opie likes fucking sports so it's like you  know text message nothing so he he does an excuse that i do which i respect no it's not an excuse i  swear to god dude i wouldn't know not an excuse but like i know you're having fun for the radio i 
[01:12:30]  would have went to the no dude i would have went to the nick game no problem i do not answer his  text that's what i'm that's the context all his emotion the context is i didn't get back to you not  even a fucking uh fucks no nothing just no yeah that's where i can't go but there was no excuse i  had get the text and go ah click i had a little birthday party on long island for a six-year-old i had to go to  my niece that doesn't leave me that that would leave you more time to text than being at any

[01:13:30]  night i think it went okay it was very awkward as small talk because we decided to take it to the  next level you know we're all getting along with patrice so now like he invited me to the nick game i  called him back last night a little small talk yeah i think there's a potential friendship that's  did you have any mutual interest that you know you can feel when it was when it you know you feel  when it just dried out like you know like with the spaghetti strain of that last bit of water  you know spaghetti you can feel that conversation just draining off the spaghetti and it just was like 
[01:14:00]  so so then hey man i'm gonna watch uh flavor i'm like uh i'm watching it just uh  oh oh no it didn't hit that wall and then it was the awkward hang up it was just uh i thought it  was a good start take it easy man it was a good it was a good no it's not even trying i would like  to be your friend actually i have a similar story bob kelly tried to become my friend because he  started doing the radio show and i was at starbucks with him and jim norton one day and he's doing all

[01:16:00]  actually gonna uh call you up because i wanted to go down the cellar this weekend but then i had to  get out to the long island check out the restaurant and stuff but the nick game was cool huh yeah  fucking dude i've never sat on the court genius oh un-fucking-believe it was like even though it  doesn't even matter if you're a fan or not if you sit on the floor yeah it's just to watch seven  foot tall like superhuman people run around and just the the intricacies of fucking basketball you  don't realize how tall those guys really are until you sit really close because on tv at all yeah 
[01:16:30]  because on tv they all look you know relatively the same height so you don't really get an  appreciation for how ridiculously tall these guys are like he just said even the small guy would  dwarf you yeah jamal crawford's six six he looks he's the small guy he's a small guy it's like what did  you just and they're just and they're all tatted up they had a white boy in uh on new orleans big  white boy anderson who actually watched web junk 20 he and he's oh real ghetto long hair for for a

[01:32:00]  because of this parking seat office the seattle seahawks made a gauge the seattle seahawks it's  been raining in seattle for what forty straight days kentucky didn't rain yesterday some of those  names are just seattle just isn't a football city no you know they really don't care about they'd  rather just not even care they do care they don't do fucking heroin i don't know man that that was  did you hear how loud that crowd was yesterday during the game i mean you could barely hear troy  aikman no great friends man troy you could barely hear them comment we really need to hear troy 
[01:32:30]  aikman anyway you don't like his commentator what do you love about football big man nothing's worse  than shannon sharp he's the worst why he can't you can't even understand what he's saying and then  he's he can't understand exactly what he's saying well well look in the mirror man jesus  i'm having trouble understanding boomer's size and he's speaking too white  let's see great fantastic what do you say phone isn't it phone toasty 
[01:33:00]  i like you though you fight back well it's cute how you fight back  phone toasty you should say phone toasty like like shannon what's been going on in this football  oh man what i like about football and uh than help me out today we have uh sideline reporters  that's what i like these stupid broads on the sideline i like the dumb 
[01:33:30]  shit i like the cameras and that's funny how you say plural it's amazing how they all just kind of  snuck in there these bitches yeah all out of nowhere all of a sudden now let's go down to the field and  it's a bitch and it used to be oj it used to be juice used to be late john with that glove yeah  he had the gloves he got the gloves he had the bruno molly shoes he's down on the sideline  fucking knife murder weapons everything and that and you know what back people don't remember this  shit what was it fucking twelve years ago they use all his sideline shit as as evidence as evidence 
[01:34:00]  like they just would would highlight look at his hat look at slow motion there's the glove right there  freeze it freeze it blow that up now jury i'd like you to look at that glove same glove he used  now pan on the sideline that doesn't have the bruno molly shoes that's what amazed me about that  whole trial there because the glove didn't fit right but if you're going to commit a murder why would  you get a perfectly fitting glove well that would not be in your psyche like all right i'm going to get  a oversized glove or a glove that's a little tight glove fucking no no one said no yeah didn't he have some 
[01:34:30]  no one gets an undersized murder why not look all silly i'm just gonna get gloves and cover up my  fingertips see you don't know how to think like a killer i'ma kill the bitch with some with the uh  the godfather puppet things i'ma have a knife in it marionette you don't know how to think like a  killer though that glove fit fine he had that fucking plastic glove over it first so that uh 
[01:35:00]  the uh the blood or something so he had a surgical glove on and then they're trying to pull it on and  he's making an arthritis claw as they're trying to pull it on that was such an that was more acting  than he did in the naked gun movies i don't think it was you know he put it on and made that face like  oh and he's looking and he's going to it don't fit he was doing he was pointing at his own hand 
[01:35:30]  with the glove on it and making the look it don't fit as he's stretching the fingers as far as they  can go oh can you imagine that there are people that are 18 years old now that were in the  fucking in preschool yeah yeah kenny when that shit started and they don't even know why their  parents and their uncles and people still to this day are thinking about fucking juice how does that  fucking happen how how is juice it's 12 years later we went from woman's sideline things to a 
[01:36:00]  complete glove explanation with the claw and the fucking and the passion how did oj how does this  happen still to this day we're talking the second johnny cochran came up with hey if it doesn't fit  you must acquit god took the part of the brain that that came up with that and put a fucking  tumor in it the same part that came up with that rhyme he put that right in the courtroom he put the  tumor there and years later that's what killed him oh man if it does not fit you must acquit i just 
[01:36:30]  want oh it rhymes that's all i want out of this oj thing i'll leave white people alone for the rest of  my life if they can just admit that they just that that nigger getting off with that shit bothered  them on just a racial level stop with the oh i'm just upset uh you know i'm angry with when any man  kills anyone anywhere in life it was the fact that johnny cochran and the whole all the rest of them 
[01:37:00]  completely played the race card they used mark firman just another white cop who used the word  nigger somewhere in his career god god forbid i defy you to find one white person out there  that hasn't uttered that word at some point in their life never mind a cop i won't you'll find it  i'll find it you'll have to tape it and then i'll never find the police find them at the secret  meetings every week did oj do it oh no stop it how do you not say yes instantly oh my now you are 
[01:37:30]  fucking with us no can i please say something why can't you admit that he did it no you can't and you  have to leave this is insinuating let me just say there's not many brothers listening to this program  you're safe here there's a lot of but you're safe here can i tell you something yeah i got a couple of  emails there's a there's a underground i know you told us about the underground railways like the dl black  listeners man that that really listen to the show but they can't admit it because you guys are so

[01:38:30]  by the way this is a yes or no question yes yes i cannot because i cannot it's just like michael  jackson okay i'll be honest it's like when a white person asks you the question if a black people ask me  it's like hell yeah the mother-fucking touched the kid fuck yeah he did it yeah but when white people ask  you black questions it's just like you can't just say yes right you can't it's the rules why yes  i saw he did yes uh them glovers them glovers fit so and that's just like i was on fucking uh 
[01:39:00]  uh adam carolla and adam carolla showed me a picture of don't talk about all reality shows suck  but he shows a picture of whitney houston and bobby brown and whitney with the cracked up face right  and it's like why would you pull out all the fucking so that so i'm the motherfucker that that  that trashes crackhead whitney to save you or there's a fuck you i know the tricks motherfucker  so it's like it has to be extended right now i'm just gonna say here's what i'm saying okay human 
[01:39:30]  nature yes or no one listen no one plans no one plans to chop premeditated if they had said that it  was a crime of passion i'll immediately juice did it uh-huh but no one first degree plans to chop their  wife up yes they do what they absolutely no one first degree plans yes they do almost remove a  head in a in a in a brutal knife thing no one says you know what here's my plan all right i'm gonna 
[01:40:00]  get together and put these gloves these gloves on these shoes i'm gonna sneak and then i'm gonna  chop the bitch in half they do things like poison or shoot her with a silence or something if you're  gonna plan a murder you don't plan a chopper he wanted it to look like it was a random murder on  the street somewhere so he can't comes up with the knife the friggin mask boom slit the throat  the boy guy is there he's got to take him out and then he juices his way home covered in all the 
[01:40:30]  blood and the friggin hood and he's throwing stuff the limo drivers outside  he's ringing oj's buzzer oj oj where's my where's my doorbell okay this is our greatest bid ever and  for 15 minutes 20 minutes go by the limo driver waiting for oj nothing nothing nothing let me hit  the bell again i got it hold on hold on okay i love being part of this bit hold on where are

[01:41:30]  imagine this guy isn't home you told me eight o'clock it's now 8 15 oj and then what the  what the fuck what was that i just saw something kind of run by this dark figure ran by i can't  ah that's weird oh jay yeah i'll be on the moon i was just dipping golf balls i answered the door like  that for finish jesus christ this motherfucker i just think i just think it was too violent for him 
[01:42:00]  that did it and get away with it so it was this bunch of people you don't get away with crap all  of a sudden we're sitting around drinking a few beers and going let's frame oj uh no i think it  was just it was easy enough like to really this this may be shocking i'm not positively just from  gut feeling i'm not positively sure that scott peterson killed his wife so just to let you know  it's not a racial all right i'm not positively sure of that i will say scott peterson so absolutely 
[01:42:30]  killed his wife i am white that guy left all kinds of forensic evidence as did oj the jury was too  fucking stupid to realize that that evidence pointed to oj wasn't it was put it this way he may have been  guilty but or he may have done it but he was it was not reasonable doubt and and and here's the 
[01:43:00]  thing about black folks let me he did on a cross thing you understand this and you heard it a million  times opie you've heard it a million times we don't give a fuck about oj it was just a slap and crack his  faces that's all the trial was was like thank you a nigga got off that's all it was as a manager of  this fine program i'm going to the bullpen ross right oh we lost my bull god damn it all right  i'll go to uh i'll go to the lefty rob the trucker black trucker rob oh shit did oj kill her 
[01:43:30]  all right thank you thank you how to bring in the lefty thank you he's a trucker he just murdered  somebody just now he don't count truckers don't count they kill motherfuckers all day i'm going  in they want some of the pressure off them all day these niggas all right that was the setup man now  i'm going to the closer sarg south carolina black guy yes yeah the evidence was overwhelming against 
[01:44:00]  them until they heard the firman nigger interview yeah when they pulled out the firman nigger interview as  they called it where he was on there and he he uses the word it was over all of a sudden it goes  from that to well if he used the word he obviously framed him for murder whose fault is that whose  is it okay if you if you are up are you if you're up for murder okay do you not and you're trying to get 
[01:44:30]  off and you're trying to get off do you not want every horseshit whatever excuse to get you off you're  right patrice exactly you are right you know what you know something you're right and as a black guy  oj and as a black attorney johnny cochran to play that race card is just beautiful because then  when it really is happening and there is an innocent black guy and he steps out and says look i was  framed or i'm playing the race card we all turn and go you're so full of shit because look what 
[01:45:00]  you do that anyway anthony did you you didn't do that before juice that's not a  fucking precedent that hurt because black guys have been going to jail for the shit they didn't do  forever and not in that jail they've been getting hung from trees what the fuck is this where's the  milkman where's the fucking well are we shopping at gimbals miners are still dying this is miners are  still dying you're right it's still meyers he makes a good point anthony i'm saying i don't 
[01:45:30]  give a shit either way but i'm saying i can't he was found whatever the fuck you want to call it  not guilty no not found innocent not guilty not guilty but what with all the crimes right why  this is my and i've never gotten this answer i'll even say juice did it if i can get this answer  why have white people been how come this is shaking you listen you had michael jackson  uh-huh and you wouldn't even take him because you're still thinking about oj you don't want 
[01:46:00]  anyone else except for juice we accepted oj as one of our own that's right just like michael jackson  we let one in and he disappointed you let a lot in you let oprah in oj was so non-threatening  and so funny in the naked gun movies and i would rent a hertz car just because he told me  i love that he was alone and it was a good sport he would he would put on the oversized afro for  that big afro wig for us oh you fucking asshole he used to do things for us you still want to be my 
[01:46:30]  friend do you i'll be coming in patrice do me a favor put on this afro wig we got a bit yeah i got a  cocktail party can you get over for a while i just canceled all my other employment opportunities open to work on this radio  show and now you're gonna do this to me wow you know you bring it up but i don't really understand  why it meant so much why were white people and and and won't admit see this is the thing two things 
[01:47:00]  that's all i think also because black people were so ecstatic that he did get off because it was wouldn't  you fucking be socially it was just a social victory did i give a shit if robert blake got  off i could give of course fucking i could care why people don't have a connection to each other on  that level socially you and opie have a separate whiteness you know there's no togetherness with  your whiteness i gotta represent the second we tried togetherness with whiteness uh you get called 
[01:47:30]  out as being a militia a white supremacist group a white pride white power that's what you that's what  you do no we just hate like when oj gets off yeah you know you can that doesn't mean you have to go  right to you know stomping uh get my doc martens and let's go stomping uh uh with shaved heads you  gotta understand there's such a difference between how you roll and how we roll it's just like i wish  okay now i'm not very careful with the that comes out of my mouth often i'm i'm pretty loose with my  mouth but you as a black person you just if i decide i want to just be free with my mouth i gotta 
[01:48:00]  understand there's ramifications of somebody going you know brother you know if you're not rep you know  you're on that show with those two racist hunkies man and you just be laughing and you just be  having a good time and them dudes be laughing in your fucking face thank you barack obama you know  you know what fuck them two hunkies i'll come in there you look at fellas i can't  fuck with you no more i'm going back home and just lay down and make no money and do  shit yeah because but i'm saying i wouldn't do it but that's the pressure you if i put on some some 
[01:48:30]  goofy and i just go walk around because i say you know what i love tap dancing and i love my eyes  being big as they possibly can it just makes me have a good time when my eyes bug makes my face  comfortable it's like white people can do anything they want to do and be as foolish as they want to  be and other white people don't go you a sellout white person you just you hold your arm bro  i have to you give it you give it back pretty good by the way uh pat from boston has something 
[01:49:00]  he wants to say pat sure it's racist pat boston pat pat pat yes or no just leave your footnotes at  home okay buddy the footnotes are getting you all right whatever so uh just to just to wrap up this  thing uh nfl sideline reporter pam oliver we were that's where this started right because we were  it was yeah god it's so weird the tangents we go on on this how how juice just still emotes past  and people aren't even at home again when two people listen to show they're not going oh god 
[01:49:30]  juice come on it it's still like oh it resonates people remember details rage yeah where i sit though  i it wasn't a black white thing for me it was i i but was you angry i was angry that her murderer  got off i'm angry at why why weren't you mad that the guy that owns time square dressed up like a  woman and chopped up his his neighbor dude and he got off i was more i was more angry at the black  people being so excited that he got off that's what made me more angry than him getting off did you 
[01:50:00]  understand absolutely not i thought you didn't understand i thought it's hypocrisy we don't  qualify to be called hypocrites no i i see it as hypocrisy in in this day and age in the 90s where it  went when it was i saw it as hypocrisy time ended for you like there was a there was a a time where  the the where whiteness the whole civil rights thing ended kind of for white people like okay  it's over la la la yeah when did it end for black people that's all i'm saying it never ended we just 
[01:50:30]  took away the colored drinking front of things but it's still and let a couple of niggas play golf  but we're at what point a couple they're number one and number two in the world we're number one  number two once we get a hold of something you know what y'all let us do it johnny so i'm i'm just  saying and all these black hockey players it's around the corner so white people finish in terms  of that kind of ship you see it's because the big black the the slave owner what he would do is  breed the big black with uh god god speed there it still goes on it's just not you're not able the 
[01:51:00]  difference is you're not able unless it's finding context or a motherfucker on the phone calling you're  not able to just go listen nigga you can't play this you can't do that you gotta drink there's no  overtness man now it's all under under underneath you gotta i'm not talking about whitey all of  a sudden getting in your way here i'm talking about black people uh hurting themselves with  supporting oj and being happy didn't it ruined we didn't it ruins the credibility when there is 
[01:51:30]  somebody that is unjustly imprisoned and black people get together to support this guy and we go  fuck you oj we didn't support oj that's what you have to understand there were parties in the  streets it wasn't about oj it could have been fucking uh freddie washington we just like to see  one get off even if he did it even if he did it and we have to go back because you don't have it so 
[01:52:00]  it's not so prominent because white boys ain't ain't as prominent as they were on the racial uh scale  anymore but over all the years man where motherfuckers just went to jail for shit they didn't do  and all that to see a guy beat the system was was our joy and the fact that you and we can easily  say that we black people were mad at the up it was the upsetness of white people and the cheering of  black people at the same fucking time white people went oh my did you see the faces oh my god i was 
[01:52:30]  one of them but we didn't go yeah and then you went oh my god how can you support him you went  oh j got off and black people like yeah oh shit first and the first thing we said was oh  shit oj got off we just said oh shit michael jackson like you couldn't believe it we couldn't believe it  and that's why we was happy oh oh shit oh j got off immediately oh my god doctors were dropping 
[01:53:00]  their scalpers my mother worked in the hospital she said everybody doctors went oh jesus oh my god  no no nurses was dropping their trays how could this happen and she was the only black person in the  in the room at the time she didn't go oh shit oh j oh shit it was just like how can you get off  she waited until she got home yeah me and opie were on the phone we were on the phone with each  other i was watching on my tv you were watching on yours it's like here it comes here it goes uh 
[01:53:30]  we the jury uh oranthal james simpson not guilty uh we both went like first it was just silence i  remember dead silence and then it was just you gotta be shitting me you gotta be shitting me now did you  say that because you saw black people celebrating or you said that you was on the phone with obi  and just that was your your that was my initial reaction exactly before i saw any black people  celebrating why was that your reaction because he was so fucking guilty and he got off what 
[01:54:00]  and you know something dude you know something you're right the first initial reaction had nothing  with me to do with race whatsoever it was i cannot believe this guy what says it all is his  friend there kardashian even was this kardashian's face was says it all says holy he's standing there  with the jury why aren't you upset about look at the clip he goes like i was upset about that  absolutely why didn't this strike a chord why didn't beretta why didn't people go that  motherfucker killed his face you know why because not because the whole world wasn't watching that 
[01:54:30]  trial either yeah no one cared didn't care as much that dude you gotta remember that was crazy  everybody was watching the oj trial we love everybody to repeat we love racial it was all  involved with that trial it was like a movie where the bad guy got it was like million dollar baby  where it's like no did this just it was this a movie this girl lost her leg or eye or fucking head  and then he killed her this is not hollywood it was a hollywood moment and yeah the villain got 
[01:55:00]  off the villain got away deserved it i mean he not deserved to get off but usually if a character  in a movie was juice yeah he'd go to jail at the end and then if it was a true story thing they would  give you the the synopsis on what happened to him ten years later oj still he's still in jail watching  naked gun movies his he has a he's up for parole in 2016. just to let you know he's still locked up and  he ain't going nowhere it's not even you gotta understand it's so not about juice it's so not 
[01:55:30]  about juice when when black people see juice on tv playing golf and doing that and we go why isn't  people just running away from that motherfucker look at juice just playing yeah playing golf with  people we're right with you on the juice level but on the social level that's where the shit kind  of yeah i'll even work with you on the social level but as far as if he did it or not i am so  positive he killed those two people with his bare angry hands and his knife and his cuts i am not 
[01:56:00]  those come on patrice the guy's got caught my hand on a ashtray in chicago and see that yeah i got a  nasty scar on on my finger it's blood it's all fucked up and i did it i was putting up my projector  and i unloosened the screws by mistake and the projector slammed on my finger ouch now whatever  bitch got killed right outside my house that day and they look at my finger and i go no my projector  is slammed on my finger there's a lot of things that can happen to you and then you bled then you 
[01:56:30]  bleed on the same knife that slit her throat and your shoe prints are in the blood by her and it's not  just it wasn't just oj's cut finger in chicago and fucking oj  oj  oj  oj i you're supposed to be home  oj  oj  what is that big oj looking guy running into that house by the side  oh he just banged into that air conditioner that had to hurt i wonder if anyone heard that 
[01:57:00]  what's that big oj guy  oj  hello  i'm just gonna throw these clothes away  all right let's uh let's wrap up this  all right this is a 12 year thing yeah jesus christ it's amazing way to do a current event show  but it's just like patrice makes a great point people are still fucking like on fire about that  still it still really is a decide a divisive thing and in for us it never not white people

[02:01:30]  you always be laughing look at a guy with that kind of sense of humor be a  fucking murderer so we have uh so we have um john way gasey used to laugh like that  i gotta go nfl sideline reporter pam oliver yeah so they got the broads working the sidelines at the  football game we all know that i have no idea it's all the same thing to me you name one of these  quarterbacks that are now doing this uh behind the scenes stuff i couldn't tell you what uh  channel they work on pam oliver i think she's cbs pam oliver some are good the the you like the 
[02:02:00]  female reporters some of them are so legitimate i think they're just trying too hard though to to  bring everyone into watching these games they're just trying too hard it's like well if we have  more of a female presence maybe we'll get more of a female uh you know demographic watching these  games instead of getting the right person for the the best person for the job quite frankly  they don't they're trying to sex it up they're trying to add entertainment features now  i mean they don't give them jobs where it's like they don't need to have anything where you  have to they have to have some credibility if that makes sense like it's like when when they 
[02:02:30]  gave dennis miller the job it's like yeah he's just holy shit but they're not giving it's like  linda cohen who's really good is the only one that really has a credibility job out there like  that why what did she do before well glinda cohen is is one of the anchors on espion she's like  yeah she's like great like she don't even like go she's a girl you just listen to linda do her  thing but some of these chicks on the sidelines they're like you know they don't they only just 
[02:03:00]  make them talk to the coach as they're running in the sideline or go hi i'm with the guy that  holds the camera hey what do you think you know they don't they don't put no pressure on these  bitches to like make some real statements talk about the plays or something yeah nothing like  nothing they keep it very light here's pam oliver with something silly from yesterday and let's  check in with pam oliver hey there joe you should have seen the smiles on the faces of the guys down  here when matt hasselbeck completed that pass to cynical wallets they had a look of joyful surprise  like are you kidding me did home can call that well the fact that you did call that seems to suggest 
[02:03:30]  that the coach is going for it and the guys are loving it who wants to complete that play  in practice and tell them what is similar to strong the seahawks even more fired up if that is  possible third and check hell of a crowd listen to that crowd holy hell of a crowd in the game  yesterday yikes but you're just commenting about how everyone's smiling of course yeah smiling smiling  faces if you can you can there's a crowd screaming in the background and there's sun shining and um popcorn 
[02:04:00]  is everywhere and beer is very expensive you usually i'll tell you the reason why it's more  expensive that you it's beer six dollars here but it's only two dollars outside why just because  if you look around you uh there's a lot of seats thank you for that uh in-depth look thank you pam  oliver really earning her paycheck there here's uh more from pam oliver 
[02:04:30]  let's go down to the sideline of pam oliver well joe it's been interesting watching mike  holmgren matt hasselbeck and sean alexander throughout the entire game the three of them  very communicative they tend to huddle up every time the offense takes the field it's worth noting  hasselbeck who's been given a little bit more control but the offense has been doing most of the  talking holmgren nodding his head in agreement that represents a shift in their relationship  from recent years well i'll say i'll say there's some poor jock out there can't get a job and this 
[02:05:00]  bitch is on the sideline are we still on hello that's that's corporate language for uh okay  bitch go get us some toast yes and some french fries uh the men could use some coffee let's go  down the sideline to the hot piece of ass they hired so uh we could get better ratings  poor football player fucking knows everything about the game with a ribbon at a car dealership  and with muskogee right quarterbacks talk and running backs run and um we're here down close 
[02:05:30]  to the field you wouldn't believe it but there are there's a they wear helmets and that is to keep  their heads from getting hurt really bad when they hit each other so thank you pam oliver you're welcome  and he just sounds like that when he goes let's go to pam oliver hi i'm here at a white line it's  there's a 50 and then over here there's a there's a 30 right and like if i walk 20 yards and i'm counting 
[02:06:00]  watch this one foot two foot three that's a yard now when i walk that usually that means i get a first  down and i can continue to play until i get through those things over there that look like a thing though  it looks like a thing that you hit in it and it and it vibrates that would be a tuning fork yeah  so if you look just look around well it can't be around because the field square if you look a  square you'll see stuff thank you hole with a nice ass it's a hole for football you're welcome let's go 
[02:06:30]  down on the field with the broad with the nice ass uh pam someone seems to have made a mistake on  the field because uh the the marks go up to 50 and then back down again instead of continuing to 100.  thank you you stupid hole it's third and ten  a lot of people ask like if they're at the 20 yard line why isn't the field goal a 20 well believe it  or not they add the distance of where the tuning fork is and the guy holding the thingy thank you 
[02:07:00]  tight snatch it's you're welcome fourth and goal and it looks like they're going to be going for it  i always wondered how did they come up with four like why not five  terry well we're wondering why you're on the field  doing the sideline reporting for this very important game 
[02:07:30]  poor guy with two blown out knees somewhere  everything you need to just yeah he can't get his uh insurance money fights every every  month to get enough money to pay for the drugs for the pain he's got he could be on the sideline  rattling off stats and names and everything but now they want to open up the game tonight  so the wife so it's not that stereotypical husband sitting on the couch wife uh bitching at him  wife making the sandwiches making the sandwiches for the guy now that a woman is talking about it 
[02:08:00]  she can then get involved hey if she knows the game why can't my wife that's right let's get her  involved so we have to go down on the sideline and listen to the hole  we got another example of the hole on the sideline listen to this one  and holly roe let's go down and check with you well guys we're kind of joking around  why is purdue calling timeouts on defense but i really respect what brought back doing right now  he's been talking to his defense saying let's worry about this series he's coaching all these  substitutes because who knows if they're going to have to open up this competition so what message 
[02:08:30]  does it send to the kids if the coaches give up got to respect brock's back for continuing to  coach his kids down the last minutes of these games holly has not given up it's 49 to 21 sweetheart  oh oh wow that is a great dig that is a great jab sweetheart is the corporate 
[02:09:00]  bitch he punched her right in the twat oh it's like that one it's like bringing your kid to work  you know oh that's cute son oh that's cute but let me do the heavy left giving up sweetheart  toots toots you dame hey do you hear what that broad said down there oh oh my goodness and she  tried sounding like she's rattling off she got the names she got the coach coach franceschi you see a  lot of people don't realize that there are other coaches that do things when the head coach there's 
[02:09:30]  a head coach and then there's other coaches that will coach and do and say things to other players  other than the guy right that's right uh vagina that's right life support system for a pussy you're  absolutely correct i got it is that i think i gotta hear that again at the end yeah get that  iraq get the we hear that again because her rant is so she wants to sound like she knows what's going 
[02:10:00]  on all right do we have to hear the whole thing though all right all right yeah play it's quick  and holly road let's go down and check with you well guys we're kind of joking around why is purdue  calling timeouts on defense but i really respect what brought spack's doing right now he's been  talking to his defense saying let's worry about this series he's coaching all these substitutes because  who knows if they're going to have to open up this competition so what message does it send to  the kids if the coaches give up got to respect brock spack for continuing to coach his kids down 
[02:10:30]  the last minutes of these games holly has not given up it's 49 to 21 sweetheart sweetheart  yeah someone has like bashing a coach for putting in what you know someone has to come to the  defense of the hole here though why the guy's already playing all his subs right yeah the coach  has pretty much has given up not given up on the game but knows this game is done yeah it's done and  now he's he's getting some coaching in with these players that wouldn't get the opportunity to play  otherwise right that's that's but that's the point the guy's making with the this the score is so 
[02:11:00]  lopsided that it doesn't matter you can put anyone in there he hasn't given up he's given other guys  opportunities he's you know it's the end of the game it's the end of the game it's over johnny  you know and uh support the hole i supported the hole a little bit there support that hole  well now we have to play our favorite sideline clip of all time joe of all time joe good old  this is what happens when you put pitches on the sidelines you get joe willie nameth broadway joe 
[02:11:30]  a little drunk this is reason right oh yeah last year he was hammered and uh he goes off on this  check hit it one of the all-time great jet quarterback joe nameth and chad pennington what  impresses you about dad i believe uh everything that anyone else has watched uh chad play  impresses me the same thing impresses them he's a quality classy quarterback that has a touch on the 
[02:12:00]  football he's not a thrower he's a passer his mind is ahead of what the defense is and if the jets can  support him they will win the championship so it's been a tough season for jet fans what does it mean  to you it's now when the team is struggling i want to kiss you i couldn't care less about the team  struggling what we know is we can improve we're looking to make a noise now and i want to kiss you 
[02:12:30]  is that really a huge compliment if you're a chick i want to kiss you hammered joe nameth that's 
[02:13:00]  great to sexually harassing her oh that was that was great i want to carry you off the field like  your six-pack and kiss you i want to kiss you on your butt  i bet you have a tight end come here baby all right we have so much show to do so much we haven't 
[02:13:30]  even gotten to what we were talking about we're going to get to oh yeah we go yeah and had a  moment uh watching web junk 20 we'll do that next we have another country song based on uh  something we were talking about she let herself go mm-hmm by uh oh i don't know who this is by a guy  named 80 inch maybe we'll play that next and one of the uh members of the opian anthony show took it  upon himself to go see brookback mountain mm-hmm so we'll get his review next as well it could be 
[02:14:00]  uh  we're doing a radio show today  sounds like the thing we should be doing a radio show right when you still have passion for this  this is what you do a radio show every day you don't waste time bitching and complaining over and 
[02:14:30]  over again about the same shit whoo-hoo that's right from mouth trap anyway i uh i was running  to the bathroom and i heard they were playing that promo uh with clean hands yeah god damn that country  thing we did uh i don't know it kind of spawns a bunch of bits sometimes we don't even ask them  the listeners send in uh their versions of songs or bits right don't even ask you know iraq i don't  even know if we're gonna have time to do the hot uh rap tracks in america today i don't even know 
[02:15:00]  if we're gonna get there we have so much material on the show on a daily basis uh but we did the top  ten country songs in america and then we had fun with it trying to figure out what the songs were  all about and there was one song uh how did the clean hands going that was based on what song keep  forgetting that was based on um currenton  uh what was his name billy carrington what was the song we were trying to figure out that led to  with clean hands he was he was he was sleeping with his girl he was like he was doing something 
[02:15:30]  right he was doing something right yeah but what was the title of the song anyone  i must be doing something right by billy carrington right billy carrington  get to the chopper billy me and dirks so the song was called i must be doing something right  and we figured it had to be that he was clipping his uh his nails and had clean hands when he was  touching a revolver i'm scott peterson hello that'd be one of his names scott peterson 
[02:16:00]  so to back up a little bit so we goofed on the fact that what he was doing right was he had his  nails clipped he had clean hands when he was touching a revolver and we had some fun and you  guys went back and forth and and made up a song called clean hands real fast then dj new style uh  took it upon himself to come up with this little ditty we had two that came in the other one is good 
[02:16:30]  too but it's a little long dj new style hit it right on the uh the old money so listen to his uh  with clean hands song and then we got a brand new song that just came in  based on our our goofing of the country sauce  i wash my fingertips and i trim my fingernails 
[02:17:00]  i light a candle and i whistle and wait for you to come over and put me through hell  the bedroom door bursts open and there you stand i try to show restraint despite my swollen glands but  oh i'm gonna take my time slowly rub it right i'm gonna lay you down and touch your vulva 
[02:17:30]  with clean hands don't need no finger grease with clean hands i'm gonna touch that pretty crease with clean hands  i think we're gonna have to do a road show and have these guys perform some of these songs now clean 
[02:18:00]  hands so that came in a very lovely song by dj new style based on us goofing on that uh other country  song right yeah so then there was another song uh called uh she let herself go now who the hell did  she let herself go that was um the old school dude oh was that uh george straight straight yeah was it  george straight she let herself go bentley yeah and uh we uh we was trying to speculate what these country 
[02:18:30]  songs meant right what the song was going to be about based on just the title right and uh that one  she let herself go she let herself go i swear i thought it was just going to be you know this  guy girl hooked up a while ago uh she let herself go got all fat he left he leaves her when they met  she was a hot piece of ass squeezing into the tight tight jeans and right a few years go by she let  herself go a few kids later she said ah fuck it i don't need to look sexy anymore had it right it wasn't 
[02:19:00]  about that at all it was uh a song about a woman being empowered and taking her life in their own  hands and things let herself go from that nasty situation yeah we haven't we haven't rose rose uh  high enough as men to be saying make a song called hey you fat bitch get it together  well this guy is this the guy who did it 80 inch yeah so some some guy named 80 inch came up with his  version of she let herself go which is a little more like the version we thought it was gonna be 
[02:19:30]  absolutely the real version yeah the director's cut uh before they have a whole discussion on it  on whack bag i will acknowledge right now that i'm saying absolutely a lot on this program for some  reason thank you absolutely really don't need to start your stupid thread is that something that  happens i noticed that too it just hit me i'm like why am i saying absolutely about everything  absolutely i i i in radio it just happens it's called a crutch they call it a crutch but 
[02:20:00]  every so often you find yourself using the same word a lot mine is absolutely for some reason  i was saying fuck a lot i noticed the other day it's like i was listening back to the replay going  i'm really saying fuck a lot yeah the fuck people do that in real fucking life the  fuck quota went up a lot since you've been doing this radio show with us my friend well look it  you can look enslave me like you try i like to swear as you will i do enjoy swearing i i 
[02:20:30]  fucking love swearing i don't care about it when i talk i swear in my in my real life i love it  it's just a great thing to curse i was just listening to me and i was above what i usually use in real  life the f word fuck yeah i'm like i'm using it more than i do in regular life so  i was trying to not to i'm going to try to say uh i'm going to censor myself a little  like absolutely because i want to be a mouthful too robin absolutely that's a good word i say it 
[02:21:00]  i say absolutely all the time fantastic absolutely and the on a pass they pick up on everything so  i just don't feel like reading 10 pages about how i say absolutely they'll just make a photoshop  absolute op and now now they're gonna have a bottle of now they're gonna have a thread on whack bag  where i acknowledge i say absolutely a lot so now they're gonna say does he say absolutely a lot  and then people are going to say absolutely and then they're going to come up with other crutches  that we have on this program these cocksuckers talking about my laugh my natural laugh that i've 
[02:21:30]  had since i was forever years old yeah all the time that's just what i do i like having fun i like  laughing it's like oh that big fat forced left fuck you yeah you computer pussy piece of  shit you nameless unaccountable you fake name yeah i'm i'm faking my laugh i'm trying to entertain you  cocksucker for four hours a day yeah and i can't repeat something i can't laugh at my own self just  to keep me from shooting myself but it's like you go in your ego just goes wow maybe i all right i do 
[02:22:00]  you're not even a profile so maybe i could figure out who you are and punch you in the face  motherfucker yeah hiding maybe i do i love the hiders i love the hiders come on out so brave  you're all cordially invited to the studio and you try to be and you've been in the game whatever  many years i've been in the game a lot of years so you know how to just kind of it's but it still  gets somewhere in there a little bit that you have to remove yeah it's not like a tumor but it's more 
[02:22:30]  like a pimple that's your splinter it's a press and it's out and it's still there a little bit till it  heals all about like yeah yeah but it's still something when you just somebody just picks out  one little thing about your personality and and just goes with absolutely it's like you're trying  absolutely you're trying here you know you're on the air every day and trying to do a good show  i do love the pets i just like beating them up a little bit they're a lot of fun actually they make  this job a lot of fun all right so um getting back into it so um she let herself go 
[02:23:00]  mm-hmm this is the version we thought and this guy 80 inch uh took it upon himself to write a  little song called she let herself go all right this is what the country's song should sound like  shut the fuck up there ain't no reason for you to go to the store stay a fat ass on the  fucking couch that's what you do all day long anyway and if i put you on my damn truck  and that motherfucker's gonna take twice the amount of gas just to go two miles down the goddamn road 
[02:23:30]  said i said i can't take it anymore you better lay off the path  now all you do is stuff your face from morning to night  a traveling salesman out on the road don't let her come back home to a heavier load  i've gotta get this fat bitch out of my life cause she let herself go 
[02:24:00]  that's good sounds like a real country song it does 
[02:24:30]  that's very good short and to the point by the way we like that when you guys send in these uh  these bits all right i'll be according to stan from whack bag you say the reality of it is too  much okay and um from uh why not yemen on whack bag anthony says stinks on ice all the  fucking time no i don't only when something really stinks you absolutely do but why wouldn't you  fuck no who the fuck has a new vocabulary every day in real life yeah who who no one these these

[02:27:30]  would he be saying it from sir from where from where patrice sits if he doesn't know patrice is  there start saying if i was sitting in that cubicle over there i wouldn't know what the hell  was going on in the studio all right look it's gotta be from where opie sits like it's all fun for  you guys but this is very uncomfortable and wait was this shit bothering somebody until the absolutely  came up you know was the fact you say where you sit was that actually bothering to do it was  bothering joe and from where joe sits he shouldn't fucking listen to the show so much listen less 
[02:28:00]  elo's uh pulling his hair out now because we're suggesting that and it looks better huh his hair  pulled out nothing wow that went over good milo hair joke is never bombed on this show yep it bombed  i went to the uh the girl on the sideline you went to the sideline report why is anthony giving up  uh chris in georgia hey fellas what's up great man hey man when y'all gonna talk about what happened 
[02:28:30]  in manhattan and you hitting the uh on star button today oh i hit my on star emergency all day to find  out about it all right and we can do the web junk 20 thing too let's do all that all right let's uh  all right thank you i hit my on star emergency why over the weekend well opie i was uh getting on the  long island expressway i believe and uh you ever see this happen oh this pisses me off and i was 
[02:29:00]  almost happy to see this happen uh the way it did and it wasn't me involved and um you're on an on-ramp  to a highway where the speed limit is 55 miles an hour there's plenty on ramp there's a car in front  of you for some reason they will only get up to 35 or 40 miles per before they try to merge into 
[02:29:30]  traffic now me i will be doing minimal 55 usually 60 that way if someone's next to you you could back  off a little still be at highway speed get in behind them but usually i'm on the on-ramp going faster than  anyone in the right-hand lane i could fit in where i want it's a beautiful merge i am one of the best  mergers i've ever seen from where i'm sitting which is the driver's seat absolutely absolutely  fucking egg try to do your laugh i can't do your laugh see that would have been the brilliance of 
[02:30:00]  them it's going to be high but i can't do it oh lordy oh lordy oh lordy that motherfucker's got a  he's got a fan he's fanning himself he's got to be racist just to fuel the yeah get the inspiration  to do patrice's laugh oh lordy knock you down a little bit you made too many good points with that  oj thing okay gotta keep you in line showing your intelligence how dare you how dare you  from where i'm sitting where i'm sitting all right absolutely all right there uh so there's a car in 
[02:30:30]  front of me smaller car a little small red car in front of me and in front of them is this big old  like buick kind of thing yeah uh getting on the on-ramp we're all on the on-ramp uh the the car in  front of me is trying to get up to highway speed i'm getting up to highway speed the car leading the 
[02:31:00]  pack there the old buick with what turned out to be an old couple inside gets to almost the end of  the on-ramp panics hits the brakes and steps on the brakes oh boy there was so much right there  wasn't even traffic on the expressway this was the easiest merge ever but it was all panicky don't know  what to do and the worst situation you could be in is when that happens because you're looking in  the opposite direction which is behind you you're looking in your mirror or over your shoulder and 
[02:31:30]  accelerating with something unpredictable in front of you merges on a highway very dangerous thing to  do you got to constantly be looking so the car in front of me didn't was looking behind her didn't  see no break i saw no brakes on on her car nothing bam right into the back of this car airbags go off  the car spins a little bit smoke and uh i step on the brakes and i like my girlfriend's in the car 
[02:32:00]  and uh i just i pull one of those it's all right i'm not even as it's happening i'm going it's all right  i'm not even close i'm not am i any lock brakes are going and i'm turning onto the shoulder now so i i  get up on the grass and pull up next to the the car that hit the back of the other car and uh in shock  is uh uh two women two black women one older one younger the uh uh younger one i guess was driving  the older one was probably under maybe maybe 40 or something like that is uh sitting there both the 
[02:32:30]  airbags went off a lot of smoke and just she was freaking freaking out and uh i thought the car was  going to start on fire because there was that uh not that steam white smoke it was brown and black  smoke coming out from under the hood and i was saying maybe you should get out of the vehicle she  was just frozen in there she wouldn't she wouldn't leave she was just sitting in there uh in complete 
[02:33:00]  shock so the old index finger right up there to that red x on the uh mirror uh yes on star emergency  uh yes uh there is an accident i myself am not involved but a couple of vehicles involved is  uh is anybody injured i'm not sure they don't seem to i don't see any blood or anything like that but  they seem pretty shook up your location is the long island expressway exit because that gps see they 
[02:33:30]  know where you are for innocent people that don't commit crimes that's a good thing for guilty people  that that they don't like the gps i love it you press the button they know where you are and uh in no  time that would have ended the whole thing yes ma'am there's a problem here um i'm at don't need to  tell me you're at long island express well how the fuck do you know never mind bitch turn that  shit off baby yeah i'm pulling that out i know a guy he could get that on star out of there you just 
[02:34:00]  kill some people because i i don't like this shit and in no time the trooper was there took my quick  little statement and you got the hell out of there and he said he goes you should leave before the fire  and ambulance get here because then the road will just be a mess to get out of but uh that is what on  star is all about my friend that's very nice it's luxury i felt like i maybe saved a life very nice 
[02:34:30]  well my story is uh pretty interesting too what uh what happened i finally decided that uh  i need to finally own something anything and i have decided separately obviously  oh separate i thought we were buying together to uh finally like actually own something yeah  we don't own anything and it hurts us tax wise that's what we've heard i think it's also smart  that we finally buy something so uh we'll behave because then we'll have a responsibility yeah 
[02:35:00]  and i've been doing some talking and we've decided that we're very irresponsible broadcasters we know  that now yeah we have a bad track record and i think we had a bad track record and uh we're very  irresponsible because we had no we had nothing to lose nothing to lose as they say what do you got  an apartment that you're renting apartment with an old couch i've done that ever since i was out of my  house and a nice tv that will blow up our shows again i did that with a shitty job i rented a place 
[02:35:30]  i ate so i think subconsciously we want to stay on the radio for a little longer this time and we  figure if we buy something we'll have more responsibility and we won't blow up ourselves  as easy so now we're we're buying stuff we're trying to buy stuff we're buying a house so i'm trying  to buy something here in manhattan what a fucking nightmare wow you really get a lot for your money  in manhattan oopsie well from manhattan uh manhattan's like uh ground zero and then as you go out from 
[02:36:00]  the blast radius it gets cheaper uh not by much close to the city i've noticed that who if if i  moved to like montauk point i could own montauk point lighthouse everything for what they want for  a house in nassau county yeah it's ridiculous it's even worse in manhattan because it's all about  convenience and yeah manhattan is the worst you get what amounts to a studio apartment and it will 
[02:36:30]  be uh above a million dollars absolutely above a million dollars hoboken i don't want to travel too  much jersey city there is right here's my logic with that there is no building or house or dwelling  that is cheap enough for me to ever have to say i live in new jersey  ever that's just awful you get a better view of new york in jersey like 
[02:37:00]  jerseys is amazing yeah jersey city is like jersey city is a driver's license that says new jersey  it's new york without being in new york you don't have to deal with this nonsense every day wanna be  new york who even told you that you live in long island long island is like baby  fucking it's not even baby new york it's baby new jersey long island stinks it is a suburb of the  metropolis of new york bunch of garbage men and a fucking radio star that's who live

[02:38:00]  it all out right now i'm trying to educate myself so i went into uh this brownstone gorgeous the people  have been living there since like 1985 86 french couple very french and uh did it smell in there  and uh and a young french are known to stink and a young son young son meaning like teenage like i don't  know 15 16 maybe okay and we get in there and the place is perfect as far as like there's there's 
[02:38:30]  it's it's it's uh yeah well kept i should say you and your girl buying together well kept and uh yeah  trying to figure all that out yes so uh we're in we're in this place and it's uh well kept is what  i'm getting at because it wasn't the right place for me and uh they're following us around and the  ladies street you know straightening up the shoes and making sure everything is perfect as we go from room 
[02:39:00]  to room which makes me think they really want to sell this place that's the first thing i was  thinking they really want to try real hard yeah and all and i'm sitting there going why would they  want to buy her they've had this place since 1986 a little strange so i'm like and they're really  anxious they're like they're explaining everything like and you could do this with the shades and if  you want to let only a little light in and we have security bars that come down but but it doesn't  you know but you could pull them up and so it doesn't look like a prison and there's outdoor 
[02:39:30]  space and this and that i like that feature and and she's running around straightening as we go  straightening very uncomfortable uh family right so we uh take a take a peek and we look at the whole  thing and it's time to leave and we're on the sidewalk and i'm with uh the agent uh-huh the other  agent and uh we're on the sidewalk and i i have to ask him like why do uh why do they want to sell  they've had this place since 1986 well they have homes here and there and uh they have a home in 
[02:40:00]  france and uh uh uh well they want to sell this place but they're thinking of uh uh a downgrading  and and uh maybe buying another place in manhattan and like something doesn't something is a little  fishy here what the hell is going on right so all of a sudden she the agent finally offers this little  tidbit up she goes well also uh uh uh they had two sons and uh oh boy and well uh one of their sons  died very recently oh no and uh well they just uh they just want to move move on move on yeah she was 
[02:40:30]  basically telling me what i needed to know because she saw that i was a little uncomfortable with the  situation it's it's obvious to me that's their son killed them uh themselves in that brownstone  that i was just in i'm like fucking creepy shit creepy fucking shit horror movie creepy that's why 
[02:41:00]  haley joel osmond over here is like forget it man go move into that mother nah that's creepy that's  why this fine french family wants out of their home they've had since 1986 because there's an  awful memory in that fucking house it's not your memory they're gonna take it with them  fuck that stuff like that not even a drop i'm freaked out by um shapes and figures and  shit not ghosts police devils and shit don't no no anthony anthony you believe in voodoo opium that's  voodoo shit man move into that place fuck no i don't like to uh talking about this because then people 
[02:41:30]  think i'm even more crazy than i am but i do get some feelings in some places i get the feeling i get the  feeling of something's not right here i don't talk about it because people go you're scary but i do  get the feeling and i had that feeling in that place but it could have been just that i could  you know they had it on their face so it was very obvious but i knew something wasn't right in that  place and they killed themselves yeah the one kid one kid killed himself right suicide i'm like ugh get 
[02:42:00]  me out of here i don't even want to live on that street now don't even want to live on the street  what part of manhattan i don't want to say they're a lovely family and all no what area  what area i don't even want to say not even the area well fuck no let them be what do you think  people want to see the ghost flying over their houses that's it right there just the area manhattan  fucking manhattan the white part of manhattan that's manhattan thank you it was below 100 street 
[02:42:30]  it was below it was anything below it was below 100. oh some french ghost  it's exactly boo wow but then you you add it all up and like that's why they want to move from their  home that that they take care of so well they don't want to leave this they didn't want to leave this  place but they have no choice did you find out anything like how he did it i want to do some  research now is it pills or is it like a shotgun blast and they were following us around this brown  zone so i'm like they must have walked right by the area that spray some luminol around the house 
[02:43:00]  and then you fucking and glow fucking than or someone said did you see fresh paint on the ceiling  it's like jesus dude did you did you try on the tv did you unplug the tv but it came back on and then  one of the one of the boys came walking out of the television white noise is fucking i don't believe  i don't believe in that ghost shit i don't believe i just don't believe in ghosts that's why i'm saying  about it i don't know all i'm saying is they get feelings sometimes in different houses and things 
[02:43:30]  now did you would you have gotten that feeling if they wasn't acting all stupid i don't know that's  why i'm i'm keeping it open like maybe that's what i was picking up on that they were  uncomfortable in their own skin because they just because they just want it out of there  look at his face he's not he's so serious too oh yeah dude if you see his fucking face he's just  like all right all right carolyn carolyn and going out stay away from the light carolyn going out to  buy your own place it should be a fun a fun thing to do on a sunday i was so creeped out the rest of

[02:44:30]  maggots on it on the counter or a steak crawling across the floor it's nothing like that ah turn this  all right you really know people don't even understand this motherfuckers creeped out i was  definitely out by the place if they came in and said you know patrice come in and have a seat you  know all my family we shot each other we killed each other how much is it 500 000 for manhattan for a  fucking house i'm taking it 500 000 more than that way more way the fuck more all right how much would

[02:45:30]  on the sidewalk because i was asking questions and uh you know no she has to tell you if somebody died  in the house they have to tell you there you go she was playing you she was trying to get you  emotionally attached to the house which is a trick they use in order to get you to put in an offer  they want you to feel sorry for the family and have some sort of oh they need to have this  well then then she's good then she's good i'm not even gonna defend myself and she's good 
[02:46:00]  nah i'm telling you it was it was pretty obvious dude that's that's that's come on who's pulling out  that card you know the friends are good actors they're good actors gerard depardieu  fucking jerry lewis they're great actors those french yeah they love them so that was my uh my sunday  oh well uh this is a wonderful house hey my son his brains turned into a souffle on the floor but 
[02:46:30]  it is beautiful plenty of closet space it all started with why are they selling them  on the sidewalk because it was obvious like they've been here 20 years there's no real reason  to leave but why so i asked that like you know just out of curiosity that's the type of thing you  ask why are they selling well uh uh well they have other houses she's talking around it and i'm like  huh like i'm still not buying it and then she's like well they also uh they had a tragedy  they lost a son very recently and then she gave me the look like you know you know 
[02:47:00]  she's kind of like giving the backward nod there like you know you know you know she gave a  fucking throat cut you know the thumb throat cut i think worse than shooting for a suicide in a  house that you bought would be a hanging like somebody found hanging from a ceiling fan in the bedroom  where you gotta sleep every night look up at it let's go to josh and jerry listen to this music 
[02:47:30]  this is creepy josh and jerry what's going on um yeah i was looking at a place in baltimore with my  girlfriend and the uh downstairs basement was kind of like the fucking looked like a seat uh the set  from six feet under and the uh there's some bed laid out for the picture of some old broad over it  come to find out that it was a grandmother that had like this fucked up debilitating disease she died in  the place and you could fucking feel like the place got cold as soon as you walked downstairs

[02:51:30]  driveway little driveway sealer you know little driveway sealer no like the god the dead people  have to stay where they like got killed so the only problem with that house is you look out the  windows at night you might see a little something something or worse yet you're backing out of your  garage you look in the rear of your mirror and there's a little kid there right ghostly little  kid like in your mirror oh that would be creepy how much cheaper did you get the house you think  about 100 100 000 yeah the house was probably came out about 250 i thought it was 175 oh my god look 
[02:52:00]  at that so i'm seeing a good strategy here you see a house you want and you don't have a problem with  it you get a homeless guy and you take him over there kill him and then uh no one will really care but  then they'll have to disclose it and take some money off your house oh that's just a suggestion  century 21 wants to do all right thank you bill good story all right we should uh oh you got to talk 
[02:52:30]  about web junk 20. patrice's new hit show for vh1 blowing up i thought we were going to take a cakey  breaky did he just say a cakey breaky we're all eating  a cakey breaky i hope that fucking cake is is possessed it's very good  actually i think you need a prop for your story because it's a it's an uncomfortable  story so you could kind of a little uncomfortable so you make it a little casual as you're eating 
[02:53:00]  the cake all right web junk 20s on vh1 with patrice o'neal got a very funny show peek at that one it's a  good one i like it's all uh web videos vh1 is my favorite channel right now between uh flavor of  love web junk 20 and of course celebrity fit club web videos uh how many different sites are there now  i mean there are thousands of websites that you can go to and just download people doing dumb  shit well that's all the rage with the kids you know with the kids seriously it's it's blowing up 
[02:53:30]  with uh the uh the uh the younger demos they all have their favorite sites which has all the crazy  videos there's everything from surveillance cameras catching people doing stuff upskirting  upskirting people just doing dumb things like that kid that uh was opening up the car door and  hitting people on bicycles uh and then wound up opening the car door to hit someone on a bicycle  the bicycle is swerved and the kid in the back seat kind of fell out and his head smashed right into a 
[02:54:00]  bumper of a car that he was really close to and he lived one of my favorites yeah he lived and he  wasn't even that injured actually lived and there's just there's so many of these websites around so much  video and vh1 uh made a show about it pop up some of the the funniest ones uh most interesting ones  and patrice comments on them it does a great job really does a good job it's very funny his comments  are always snide sarcastic and very funny so uh it was on uh i think it's on 24 hours a day seven 
[02:54:30]  days a week on vh1 you could catch it it's all the problem with the vh1 shows catch it now yeah that's  the problem with the vh1 shows it wrecks uh my dvr wrecks up my recording of these shows records  everything yeah i just make it real easy i just go record series and next thing you know i got like  10 versions of the same web junk 20 yeah taking up all my space so uh you know me me and uh my 
[02:55:00]  girl laying in bed watching uh watching the show and uh well you know what happens opie you're laying  in bed uh with your girl or maybe uh i don't know you with your guy in a a sleeping bag up on broke  back mountain wherever these things take place it might get a little amorous you know what i mean  i like to say a little saucy a little frisky a little saucy 
[02:55:30]  from where i was sitting  yeah yeah a little corner music  you know you're in bed you start uh you start having uh what they call the uh sexual uh relations  there open what's called the monkey sex ah right whatever you want to call it uh i had a couple  i had a couple of drinks so you know we're a little sloppy having some fun you know some good clean fun 
[02:56:00]  good clean american fun like a guy and a girl should have in a bed and um it's weird when you have a job  like we have because occasionally unlike a lot of people in the world your friends pop up on television  and it's an odd thing when it first happens i i mean i there have been times you're you're having  sex and there's my pal adam ferrara all of a sudden hey there pal hey give her a good one for me tag 
[02:56:30]  her in the yes you know you just hear their voice and i know tv's not a two-way thing but it's kind of  just weird hearing your friends talk while you're having sex with your girl that's all i'm trying to  say you know i did feel it did you you son of a bitch i knew it i saw it in your face i did feel  it it's just one of those things that i felt an energy it's an energy it's an energy unless something 
[02:57:00]  most people don't have their friends on television to for that to happen to but it's been enough years  where it's happened where that part of it doesn't really bother me so patrice being on television  while i'm having sex doesn't bother me that much but then the the clip he played now we're really  getting into it and you don't want to be distracted or or ruin any moments by what's happening on  television so you try to phase it out and a lot of times you can but when it's uh a clip that we've 
[02:57:30]  played on the show enough times it it catches your ear no matter how distracted you are by other  activities so in the middle of of going at it as they say i hear this good lord good lord good lord  yes three times with patrice laughing and commenting is that something to the effect of an act of fault 
[02:58:00]  talking about nothing falling off the stage so the first time i hear it yeah i try to ignore it  as does my girlfriend we ignore it we're successful in ignoring it the second time  oh good lord i start feeling a little shaking and hear at which point yeah the third one comes we both 
[02:58:30]  lose it hysterical hysterical fucking laughing our asses off how funny was that motherfucker you know  talking about it and then i went to the shakespeare of hub hub hub covering and uh... the coventry uh...  school it's only been three of us who ever graduated from the coventry school uh... uh... fine  hubbubhole you know the harvard a hasty pudding uh... when i was voted the oh yeah oh dear lord 
[02:59:00]  ball on your fucking ass oh he was really pompous it was just so perfect  yes there it is yes yes yes yes yes ah oh yeah oh yes yes good lord good lord  good lord oh good lord 
[02:59:30]  that was a two camera shoot  Yeah, that's a little strange. 
[03:00:00]  Yeah, we just like laughed our asses off.  One time would have been fine.  Oh, dear Lord.  And, you know, because it's sex and it's just goofy anyway.  So to hear the oh, dear Lord clip, it kind of fits.  Yeah, but, you know, then you got to get right back into action.  So I laid the law down.  You can get a doggy starter. 
[03:00:30]  You can get a lean on your side.  Those are your only choices.  This is my house and I get the same.  And, yeah, we finished up with this.  Oh, fuck.  Oh, dear Lord.  Wow.  So good.  I'm glad you could join us.  Okay, terrific.  So glad you could be there.  I'm going to help out.  All right, listen. 
[03:01:00]  Let's say hi to Steve and Becky.  Steve and Becky.  36-inch TV.  Big Patrice head staring in my bedroom.  Oh, and his giant, too.  I just want my head to go away.  Anthony!  What the fuck are you doing in there?  It's like you're looking in the window.  Oh, wait.  Someone has a relatable story.  Turtle from whackbag.com.  Turtle.  Hey, guys.  I was having sex with my wife probably a couple months ago, and my father-in-law calls from  a bar drunk. 
[03:01:30]  We've got the answering machine in the bedroom.  Oh, no.  So I'm, you know, doing it.  And the next thing I hear is, hey, Tara Mark, can you come take me off?  And you're trying to fuck while your father-in-law is talking in the background.  I, you know, really, well, sort of lost it.  That's great.  Got that one.  Got that one once, though.  You did?  Hi, Anthony.  It's Mom.  Nothing important.  Just call and say hi. 
[03:02:00]  And, like, you're just looking at the situation you're in, like, oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  Look at what, look at what I'm doing.  All right.  Well, if you give it to me, maybe you're out or doing something.  You got a moment.  Just give me a call.  Okay.  Bye.  I love you.  Oh, man.  That's really.  We interrupt this program.  Oh, what?  Oh, a midget sighting.  Oh, a midget sighting.  Robert from Georgia.  What do you got?  Hey, I got a midget spotting for you guys.  All right. 
[03:02:30]  Hey, I was in a Walmart yesterday, and the greeter at the door, I saw the carts moving around,  and the summits was not even as tall as the shopping cart.  A little short black dude in dreadlocks, man, about 40 years old, and he couldn't have been three foot tall.  But I started laughing, and my wife didn't know why, and I kind of explained to her.  So I got to call O&A and let them know, man.  A little midget sighting.  A little midget sighting.  Oh, there you go.  A little fidget.  What was the little fella doing?  He was, uh, he meets you at the door, and he hands you the shopping cart.  But the funny thing is, you see the shopping cart coming at you, and you don't see this 
[03:03:00]  fucker behind the cart pushing it.  See, that's the best thing about the midget sightings.  It's not the fact that you saw a midget.  It's what the little guy was doing when you saw him.  Because no matter what they're doing, it's always hysterical funny.  Because they do things like that.  One guy comments on the shopping cart.  You see the shopping cart moving, you don't, it's like, what is it, a locomotion?  It's just kind of moving itself.  Oh, it's a midget.  You think it might be a ghost?  No, it's a midget.  Or then there was a guy that saw a midget in a supermarket, and he needed help getting 
[03:03:30]  something off the shelf, and it was, like, waist high on a normal person.  And he was jumping and, like, taking those big tomato juice cans, putting them on the  floor, and standing on them to get something.  That shit's hysterical when it's a fidget.  Meanwhile, back at the show.  Can't believe your mom would call and leave a message.  I know, it was very embarrassing.  Absolutely amazing.  Anyway. 
[03:04:00]  Let's go to Steve and Becky.  Steve and Becky.  Hello.  Hi, Becky.  You have to excuse me.  Somebody's got a cold beer on my tits.  You have a cold beer on your hooters.  On my nipple right now, yeah.  Why?  And you're on Pal Talk?  Uh, it's his morning beer.  What?  What's your...  All right, you're on Pal Talk.  We've got cameras in the studio now. 
[03:04:30]  Yeah, we're on Pal Talk.  We've got these Pal Talk rooms all over the place.  And what's her name?  Stephen Becky.  Stephen Becky.  All right, let me pop your cam up right there.  Or Tucker Steve.  Oh, there you are.  Put it back on.  All right, I'm looking.  Wow, you've got big tits.  And a round face.  And that's Steve.  He's putting a cold beer on your tits.  Oh, she seems to be enjoying that.  A lot of people are saying, I see her on the radio. 
[03:05:00]  That's the beauty of Pal Talk.  Yes.  Why don't you lift both...  Lift that shirt up so we can see both of them.  Make sure they're both the same size.  All right.  Yay, they are.  How about that?  And she's smoking and on the phone.  Jesus.  And she wants to...  You want to play Guess What's in My Pants today live on Pal Talk?  Yeah, let's play Guess What's in My Pants.  All right.  Now, when we do this live on Pal Talk, 
[03:05:30]  it takes on a whole different thing than it does regular Guess What's in My Pants.  Okay?  Do you know how to play Guess What's in My Pants?  Yeah, I hold the receiver up to my bush and rub it around.  And rub it around.  Right.  Now, you know what the most important thing is?  Is to not show your bush until this is done.  Because the last time this happened, the girl stood up.  We saw the bush.  Bit ruined.  Not really.  It was just a shadow.  It was a bunt shadow.  A bunt eclipse.  A bunt eclipse. 
[03:06:00]  All right.  What you have to do is stay exactly where you are,  because I can't see below your midsection right now.  But take your pants and panties down as Opie does it.  Yes!  And take your pants and panties off.  But don't stand up.  And don't show us your bush.  You got that?  Yeah, I got that.  All right.  Pull them down.  There she goes.  She's pulling them down. 
[03:06:30]  Oh, that was quick.  You got them down?  Yeah, they're down.  There she goes.  Is that a guy?  Does he have a pest shirt on behind you?  Yes, he's got a pest shirt on behind me.  It's one of our pests.  All right.  I always have a pest shirt.  Your pants are down.  Yes.  And now how we play, guess what's in my pants?  She will rub the phone on her bush.  And just judging by the sound that is made,  we will determine what hairstyle she has. 
[03:07:00]  Ban Real 2000.  Ban him right the fuck now.  He IM me.  His big IM comes up right in front of the picture of the naked girl.  You're banned, fucko.  Why would anyone IM me in the middle of video,  guess what's in my pants?  Real 2000.  Bye-bye, shithead.  Bye-bye.  Jesus.  Bye-bye.  I'm trying to look and participate,  and an IM thing comes up and blocks everything. 
[03:07:30]  Bye-bye, dickface.  You lose.  Okay.  Hey, um, we don't need the music, believe me.  Why not?  We need the theme song.  All right.  We've got to make it radio-friendly.  Yes, we do.  All right.  All right, and then we'll get right into it.  Let's play the theme song for Guess What's In My Pants,  if Eric has it.  No bouncing up before the fucking show's over either,  Doug, you dick.  Yeah, you got us on that one already.  All right.  Hit it. 
[03:08:00]  Bum, bum, bum, bum.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  Place my receiver.  Up on your beaver.  It's time to play.  Hey, guess what's in my pants?  It's time to guess.  What's in my pants?  My pants.  All right, Becky, if you will, take the phone without standing up or anything. 
[03:08:30]  Just spread them and rub up and down in an up-and-down fashion a few times on your bush.  Okay.  Okay.  All right.  That's got action.  She's got action down there.  That's telling.  Very good.  Okay.  All right.  Now, if you would do the same thing, side to side, please.  Side to side.  Okay.  Side to side. 
[03:09:00]  Side to side.  My God.  All right.  All right.  There's definitely something going on there.  Okay.  Now, in the most telling fashion, if you would rub it in a circular motion.  Circular.  Sounds like popcorn.  I was going to say.  Sounds like a bag of Fritos. 
[03:09:30]  Fritos.  Jesus, bitch.  Shade that marching band down there.  Sounds like some goose-stepping.  All right.  Now, without standing up, don't stand up yet.  Don't show anything.  We're going to run through what the possibilities are for the people playing at home.  All right.  There is the standard issue girl triangle, which is just a bush.  Big bush.  This could also be trimmed down a little bit, so it's not so, you know, wild.  But it would still be the standard issue female triangle bush. 
[03:10:00]  Then there is what we call the landing strip or the mohawk.  That is a strip of hair that just goes straight up like a landing strip or a mohawk.  Then there is the Hitler mustache, which is like a landing strip, only shaved shorter, down from like the belly button down to the vagina.  So it's only a little tuft of hair.  And then the wood floor, clean-shaven, JonBenet Ramsey, no hair, nothing down there. 
[03:10:30]  All right.  We've heard what it sounds like.  A lot of people guessing on Pal Talk.  Someone saying, I heard a cock.  Sounds like she's rubbing it on bubble wrap.  Chewbacca's leg.  Ben's head.  Hold on.  We've got a great one on line three.  All right.  Todd in Ohio has a guess.  Todd?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Todd.  Yeah, this woman here on the phone rubbing her pussy with the phone sounds like a horse eating oats. 
[03:11:00]  A horse eating oats.  No.  I like that.  I am going to say standard issue female triangle.  Now, Becky, don't say anything.  Don't shake your head.  Don't do anything that might indicate if I'm right or wrong until we're done.  I say standard issue.  Oh, I'm going to guess low self-esteem.  All right.  Low self-esteem.  What are you guessing, Opie?  Why is Patrice asleep? 
[03:11:30]  I am going to throw something at Patrice O'Neal.  Patrice fell asleep during the middle of the show.  He was out cold.  He woke up like, where am I?  Holy shit.  I'm doing a show.  You woke up like, you ain't Halle Berry.  You came to look like, oh, fuck, I'm still doing the radio show?  Wow.  It was like, oh, fuck, that's right. 
[03:12:00]  I'm on a show.  Oh, wow.  That's fantastic.  Opie, you said low self-esteem, but that isn't a category.  I know, and I was surprised I didn't get any laugh out of Patrice.  Usually I could get a good laugh out of him.  Almost got a snore.  Jesus.  I turned to him, I'm like, I thought that was a funny line.  You're sleeping.  I hear it.  Goodness.  Here it is, Anthony.  It's a completely shaved puha.  Wow.  But the problem is, once again, and this is what's wrecking the game lately, she probably 
[03:12:30]  shaved it Friday or Saturday because they had a hot, hot weekend.  It's now Monday morning and you got some action down there, a little stubble action.  I thought that.  That's why you won last time.  But it didn't have that bristly sound.  It sounded like hairs that were curling over.  So that's why I'm going with the full bush.  Patrice?  Full bush.  Full bush?  Full.  Absolute full.  All right.  Everybody's guess is in.  Becky, if you would, don't tell us, stand up and show everybody what is indeed in your 
[03:13:00]  lap.  Stand up.  Move that bottle.  Everybody, what is this in your lap?  All right.  Oh, I think Obie's right.  It looks like it's shaved yet grown back a bit.  No, that's a little more than grown back.  That looks like a Mexican cave.  Tell her to move the C-section scar for a second. 
[03:13:30]  Holy God.  Becky.  Yes.  Becky, you shaved recently.  Yeah, Friday night.  What?  Obie had it right on the head.  She shaved even out of the day.  Thank you.  You consider that a shaved Friday?  It's Monday.  I don't know what's going on there.  Was that shaved there, Becky?  No, it's pretty bushy.  From Friday?  It's a bush.  Wait, did you shave clean Friday?  No.  No, I didn't shave clean.  Yeah, all right.  So I'm like an Armenian. 
[03:14:00]  No, I didn't win.  No?  So it's standard triangle?  Yeah, pretty much.  Triangle?  That's like kind of Greek man's back down there.  Fucking...  That's a shape I've never seen as a kid.  I couldn't tell what that was, like shape-wise.  Could you stand further away from the camera?  Because it was too close.  Preferably in the next room.  Like, like, um...  Just stand up where you are and lower the camera a little bit.  Stand away from the camera.  Yeah, yeah. 
[03:14:30]  Like, lower the camera so we can see the bush.  There you go.  Okay, now stand still so that we get a good shot.  There's just...  Oh, don't move the camera so much.  Let me see the booty, too.  Fuck it.  Moving like an earthquake.  All right.  Okay, I see what it is now.  Hold the camera still, goddammit!  All right, okay.  I see what it is now.  Hey, Anthony, let me get a booty shot.  All right.  Patrice wants...  Patrice wants a booty shot.  Get a booty shot.  No, I ain't turning my ass around. 
[03:15:00]  Why not?  She wants a cut.  Patrice loves that shit.  Let's go to Jeremy in San Francisco.  Jeremy in San Francisco, what's up?  Jeremy.  Oh, he had a great line, too.  He had a good one.  She said she's not showing her booty for me.  She showed her ass a little bit.  How dare she?  All right.  Are we, uh...  Are we, uh, happy?  Yeah.  Um, I'm not sure who won that.  Tell you the truth, Opie.  I don't think there were any winners in this installment of 
[03:15:30]  Guess What's In My Pants.  He's got a guess.  That's the $250,000.  I don't think there was any winners in this.  Well, there are no winners in this.  Thank you, Jerry Springer.  She said not me.  Boy, am I a fucking dick.  So I'm sorry.  It's time to guess  What's in my pants?  My pants. 
[03:16:00]  Gotta love the pal talk.  Video, guess what's in my pants.  Sweeping the nation.  We invented it.  Hoo-hoo.  Hoo-hoo.  A big, uh, big hi to everyone in the pal talk rooms today.  All right.  We're going to take a break.  And then finally, we're going to find out  which member of the Opie and Anthony show  went and saw a brokeback mountain.  Oh, is this like confessions?  Revelations?  Is that what it is?  Somebody going to talk about  getting fat sucked out of their neck?  Or a nose job?  Hmm?  Or hair extensions?  Or being a homo?  Hair plugs? 
[03:16:30]  Well, I guess going to brokeback mountain,  that's pretty much that homo thing.  Yeah.  We'll find out next.  Steve and Becky from pal talk are back.  This is Steve.  I'm with Becky.  Hey, Steve.  What's up?  Hey, look.  I just need to ask Patrice to send her an apology note  like you did the other girl.  Yeah.  And he ran her off.  I'll tell you what. 
[03:17:00]  I wasn't really being mean to her.  But, you know, sure feelings are hurting.  I hate to...  I hate to say, Patrice.  Hold on, Patrice.  Hold on, Patrice.  Beggy, stand up and show me your ass, honey.  I like this guy.  Real pimp.  Beggy, honey, show Patrice your ass.  There you go.  Turn around so he won't get mad  and he won't be upset.  I can't see.  How's that, Patrice?  I can't.  It's not up.  Well, what the hell are you being called  talking all that bullshit?  No, it's not up.  It's not...  What?  It's not up now.  He's putting it back up. 
[03:17:30]  He's putting it back up.  Hold on, honey.  Hold on, honey.  All right.  Let me...  We're just truck drivers off for today.  Oh, my God.  We're running out of show.  I know it.  All right, Steve.  Can't see it, man.  Okay, Becky, go ahead.  There it is.  Becky, go ahead.  He wants to say you see your ass one time.  Then he'll send you an apology note on it.  All right.  This ain't...  There you go.  I'm going to be on the line.  I'm going to be on the line.  All right.  All right, go ahead.  There's the same...  I see this.  This isn't going anywhere.  All right.  Thank you, Steve.  See you later, man.  All right. 
[03:18:00]  Speaking of Steve's, why don't we get Steve in here?  Good old Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  Martini Steve.  It's Martini Steve.  We haven't played the theme music in a while for these guys.  No, that sounds kind of cool, though, man.  I haven't heard that.  There he comes.  Ah, shit.  Ah, yeah.  Steve, you're great.  I like that, Steve.  I like that.  Old school, Steve.  And you did that?  No, Drew did it.  Drew Boogie?  Yes, he did.  Drew Boogie should...  That motherfucker should make some money or something, man. 
[03:18:30]  I agree, man.  We're trying to work on some things with him.  Holy shit.  So, Steve, Mass emailed everybody.  Well, Mass.  Three people.  You, Ant, and Ben.  Oh, that was it?  Yeah.  Oh, I thought you emailed the whole thing.  That's pretty much Mass for all of us.  You went and saw Brokeback Mountain.  Yeah.  Steve?  Well, it wasn't by myself.  You know, I'm married.  I gotta, you know, when I have to, when I want to go see a...  What's that?  Oh, for Christ's sake.  You know what that is.  You know. 
[03:19:00]  I do know what it is, actually.  It's the song that's gonna win the Oscar.  I hope not.  I personally didn't want to see it, but, you know, I wanted to see Hostile, but I got...  With the Fu Manchu and the tattoos and the fucking biker rings and that.  Yeah, I know.  I know.  It's a contradiction, apparently.  Oh, my God.  I walked in and, you know, I...  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Oh, my God.  I wish I knew how to quit you.  Oh, you like that.  Don't you, faggot.  Um, yeah.  Had to...  Had to... 
[03:19:30]  Had to...  Had to take one for the team.  I wanted to go see Hostile.  I wanted to see Siriana.  So why don't you just go see one of those movies?  I will.  On my own.  I will.  But I, you know, I had to take somebody else.  I'm just surrounded on this show by putting...  Why?  I can't believe this.  Not Steve.  Yeah, Steve.  I can hear this coming from you.  No, man.  Or you.  No, because...  But not fucking Steve.  Why?  There's different situations.  I don't get...  I'm with you on this one.  Sorry.  I don't get the have to go to movies because someone else wants to see it. 
[03:20:00]  No, it wasn't...  You know, I wanted to go to a movie.  Why couldn't she go with her friends if she wanted to see it?  I'm sure she could.  Like, I have no desire to see this movie.  And no one's going to drag me.  I was curious.  I'll admit I was curious.  By curious?  Yes, exactly.  Thank you so much.  Man, what a...  Thank you.  No, he just said...  See, this is kind of...  Steve's getting a little nervous because he's going to contradict himself.  First he goes, I didn't want to see this shit.  Then it's like, I was curious to see it.  I was so curious.  Did you want to see the movie?  I wanted to see what it was all about.  But, you know, not more than I wanted to see Siriana or Hostile. 
[03:20:30]  The reality is a lot of people are going to end up seeing this movie.  And there was.  And it's going to win a shitload of Oscars.  The theater was packed.  I mean, yeah, maybe 200 people in the thing.  I mean, so more than would have seen it, you know, had it not won, what, four Golden Globes  last week?  I don't get it, though.  Most boring fucking movie I've ever seen.  Yeah, now that's what I'm hearing.  Because it was man love, right?  A lot of man love.  Without, you know, without the ass sex, it was probably the most boring love triangle  movie you've ever seen.  Here's a question for you.  Were the man love scenes believable? 
[03:21:00]  Okay, yes.  I'm not going to win either way, so I'm just going to, like, walk into it.  So you decide to just take the right hand.  Exactly.  Did they just do close-up of, like, Jake's face going, ooh, and then, like, no, no, no,  Was it a stunt ass?  No.  It was really fucking.  No, they are.  Jay is seen in the movie.  Jay is seen in the movie.  They're in their little tent on Brokeback Mountain.  And they're, what's the word? 
[03:21:30]  They, I guess, fucking in the ass?  No, Jake Gyllenhaal, they're both sleeping next to each other.  Because it's really cold outside.  Jake Gyllenhaal takes, um, what's the other guy's name?  Uh, Vaseline?  No, the other guy.  The other guy.  Um.  Heath Ledger.  Thank you, Eric.  Heath Ledger's hand runs and rolls it over his body like he wants him to spoon.  Oh.  And Heath Ledger recoils.  Another spooning scene.  Heath Ledger recoils, and then they just, you know.  They go, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep, jeep.  No?  There's a slight minute, slight, you know, a few seconds of that, and then they just go at it.  Oh.  And Heath Ledger, they both unzip each other's pants. 
[03:22:00]  Heath Ledger rolls Jake Gyllenhaal over, and then there's just cornholing.  Wow.  Yeah.  So who's bottom?  Uh, Jake Gyllenhaal.  Yeah, Jake.  Oh, shit.  And cut.  What do you mean, Aang?  I just need, I need more, I need more, I need more, I mean, I need more passion.  Motherfucker.  All right.  Action.  And cut.  It is.  Can you imagine?  No.  That's a one-take movie right there, motherfucker.  Please.  There is no behind the scenes or nothing in that flick. 
[03:22:30]  It is.  It's, it's a lot of, a lot of awkward moments, you sort of look around.  All right.  Is anybody else looking at this?  Yeah.  Now, did you look at their faces and, like, was it any glimpse of, oh my God, what the  fuck am I doing?  Like, was it any glimpse of distant thoughts?  Uh, a lot of the, a lot of the times that both actors' eyes were closed, so maybe they  were trying to distance themselves from it.  Yeah, trying to go somewhere else.  Yeah, like, find a happy place kind of thing.  Oh.  Yeah.  That's a rough act.  Yeah.  Is there a lot of couples? 
[03:23:00]  Uh, yeah.  I mean, it's mostly, uh, middle-aged people, you know, watching this thing.  And, um, and, uh, at one point in the movie, Heath Ledger, he's obviously so used to having  sex with, uh, Jake Gyllenhaal's character that he goes home to his wife, played by Michelle  Williams, and he just rolls her over and gives her the old, uh, dumper action.  In the ass?  Oh, American me.  Wow.  I think that's the implication anyway, because she's sort of, like, you know, uh, wincing during  the process.  Oh, my God.  Wincing.  Yeah.  Doesn't take it as good as he did.  No, apparently not.  Wow. 
[03:23:30]  She put a cowboy hat on and smushed it on her head.  Yeah.  I mean, I'll wear boots.  Wear this.  Honey, grow hair on your ass, would you?  Oh, my God.  Oh.  That's really hard.  Oh, shit.  But it just, it drags on.  I don't, I don't understand.  I, you know, I, I get the cringe factor.  People want to see it, because it's two guys, two mainstream actors going at it with each  other, but outside of that, boring.  What happened at the end?  What's that?  What were you hoping for?  A dick went in.  What happened at the end, like, did they... 
[03:24:00]  You want, you, you want me to fuck up the end for you?  I will.  Yeah, I'd definitely do.  Ant, do you care?  Tell people to turn a radio down or something.  I don't care.  Hey, Ope, do you care?  Who gets AIDS?  The horse?  There's no AIDS.  Nothing.  Nothing?  Oh, no AIDS.  The Indian in construction work can come out and they do that.  It takes place in the late 60s and 70s.  It takes place over the, over the span of 20 years.  So, during the course of the whole thing, Heath Ledger gets married, has a family, his  daughters grow up.  Same with Jake Gyllenhaal, gets married, has a wife and a kid, and you get to see their  whole lives. 
[03:24:30]  And during the course of this 20 years, they keep going back to Brokeback Mountain and  hooking up with each other.  Yeah.  Same time every year?  Yeah, same couple times throughout the year, yeah.  And they continue it.  And at the end, Jake Gyllenhaal gets his brains beat out with a tire iron.  Oh, by some fag bashers?  Yes, by some hooligans.  At least, that's, I think that's what's implied.  Wow, wow.  Now, is that saying that, that, that gay love is almost at the, at the movie ending, like  he deserved that fucking shit?  Almost like it's bad? 
[03:25:00]  Uh, there was a little bit of a, a warning you got, because at one point Heath Ledger  tells a story of a, of a gay cowboy that his father showed him that had gotten dragged  around by his dick.  And, uh, and they, you know, his father showed him the dead body, sort of like, don't you  ever be a gay cowboy.  Well, uh, we got Dog in Ohio has something for you, Steve.  Dog?  Steve, what the hell?  What?  He's like, what, you're not a big enough man to tell you a lady to go by herself?  No, I'm not.  That's what I'm talking about.  On the broke back, you're so good, fuck me, man. 
[03:25:30]  My wife asked me to go, and I said, fuck, take your, take your, take your friends.  Like, you got plenty of women friends that want to see that shit?  I normally do.  Normally, I do tell them to take friends.  A great man wants to see another man plow some guy from behind?  What the fuck?  Did you look up the movie times?  Uh, no.  No, I did not.  And what was your posture?  If we hurry, we can make the 9-10.  Slumped over, sort of like in my chair, like, I, like, biting my nails.  Steve's the best.  Hey, honey, hurry up, we can make the 9-10. 
[03:26:00]  Pack snacks.  What?  Was you holding on?  No.  Was she holding you?  She did the arm?  No, she had a few mouth agape moments, just like, ugh, like the whole time.  Agape.  Very nice word.  I like that one.  Yeah, I can.  Thank you.  Open, wide.  And did you walk out like, uh, all right, you know, what are we going to do now?  Let's go wrestle rhinoceroses.  Nah, walking out is a little bit awkward, because you don't really want to make eye contact  with anybody else in the theater, because everybody else is looking at the goddamn floor trying  to navigate, like I didn't just spend two hours of my life watching two guys buttfuck. 
[03:26:30]  Here's some cab money, baby.  I'm going to go choke stuff.  I'm going to choke a, Steve.  I'm going to go cut some promos and choke alligators and shit.  Show's over?  Yeah, that went to a quick click.  Oh, man.  All right.  We'll have to save the, uh, Cindy Adams for tomorrow.  I applaud you.  Steve went to go see that with his girl.  Yeah, right.  I mean, that's some pussy shit.  I would have respected them all if you went to go see it with a couple of fellas as a  joke, but not be muscled by your woman, but, you know, still, Steve's a gangster. 
[03:27:00]  Steve's a bear.  She's here with the, uh, you guys at the Adult Expo.  We're saying about that.  Yeah, we're going to get to that when Jimmy gets back.  Yeah.  We got, uh, you at the Adult Expo.  We still haven't played that audio.  Is it still here?  Yeah, it's still there.  Maybe we can play tomorrow.  So, Jim, Steve, and Laszlo at the, uh, the porn convention.  Yeah, Jimmy had fun with that.  All right.  Uh, also, the one thing we forgot to mention today, Terry Schiavo's, uh, husband there got  remarried.  That's another big story we didn't get to touch on today. 
[03:27:30]  Hit on that tomorrow?  Yeah, I guess.  We'll be in the papers tomorrow.  All right.  Yep.  Uh, let's say hi to Patrick.  Patrick, what's up?  Yeah, I was just wondering why the didn't take the field trip that you guys were talking  about last week.  Were you all supposed to go see the show?  But, uh, it seemed like a good idea when we-  At the time.  When we mentioned it on the show, and then we were just like, ugh, fuck it.  I had a feeling that wasn't going to happen.  That's not why I went.  All right.  Punching out.  Oh, really? 
[03:28:00]  Really?  Want to tell us more?  What?  You were all disappointed that we did not take the field trip?  See what?  I was really fucking out right now.  Holy shit.  Let me see, man.  You pretty much-  Yeah, you were all right.  You made it through a very uncomfortable break, and then you had to add that at the end?  Yeah, I have a way of being self-destructive like that.  Yeah.  What the hell?  Let's say hi to Sean in Jersey.  Sean.  Hey, what I learned today, that Frenchy killed himself in a brownstone recently.  Hey, yeah.  Thank you.  Rob on Long Island.  Rob, what did you learn on the show today? 
[03:28:30]  Hey, what's up, guys?  Yeah, I learned that Patrice was pushing blue girls to be, uh, fuck, can I jump it off?  Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow night.  That's it.  I'm out of here. </pre>
