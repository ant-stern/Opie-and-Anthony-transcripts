<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a furious discussion about the fallout from their final "Virus Show" at the PNC Bank Arts Center.  Opie and Anthony were livid about the audience's behavior, specifically the widespread booing of comedians like Mike Birbiglia before they even began their sets.  This hostility, they explained, had driven several well-known comedians, some previous show guests, to refuse future appearances, citing fear of the audience’s reaction. Callers flooded the lines, some expressing disappointment at the booing, others defending the audience's actions, leading to heated exchanges with the hosts.  This incident, coupled with the negativity, resulted in the official announcement of the end of their large-scale Virus Shows.  The hosts then transitioned into a scathing attack on Fareed of Citadel Broadcasting, accusing him of unprofessionalism for failing to communicate their removal from several of their radio stations.  They played clips of their replacement show, “Gray and Cluck,” highlighting its perceived blandness and lack of edginess as a stark contrast to their own style.  Patrice O'Neal was a guest in the studio throughout this portion of the show. The segment was rife with expletives and offensive language.


The show continued with several key segments.  A significant portion focused on their recent firing from Citadel stations, with a heated phone call with a former program director, "Gray," now hosting a replacement show. Gray criticized Opie and Anthony's style, calling it un-edgy and claiming their absence hadn’t improved ratings.  Opie and Anthony vehemently countered, accusing Gray of hypocrisy and suggesting his new show was failing. They also discussed Citadel’s low stock price and Fareed’s recent stock purchases, suggesting flawed cost-cutting measures.


Next, a graphic segment detailed a Greyhound bus decapitation incident.  The hosts played and discussed shocking eyewitness accounts, emphasizing the gruesome nature of the crime.  This was followed by a humorous segment featuring audio clips of an apparently intoxicated Larry King on a past broadcast, contrasting his past and current demeanors.  The show briefly mocked the movie *Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2*.


The broadcast then played multiple audio clips of a seemingly inebriated program director, "Frankie Blue," rambling incoherently, repeatedly mentioning a "50 grand prize winner" and potentially using the f-word. Opie and Anthony recounted his firing after an altercation with a female DJ following a Christmas party, presenting it as a comedic example of a radio personality behaving badly.


They returned to the cancellation of the Virus show, further detailing the increasingly hostile audience behavior, specifically mentioning Bill Burr alongside Mike Birbiglia as targets of the audience's hostility. The hosts discussed the difficulty in assembling a lineup and the unruly audience’s negative impact on the event, mentioning a near-crisis involving the parking lot. A caller, Sean, stated many disruptive audience members were from New York. Logistical issues concerning the car giveaway were also discussed.


A segment followed heavily featuring Bubba the Love Sponge, with the hosts criticizing his public statements, particularly his frequent use of "I don't care," which they interpreted as a sign of him actually caring deeply. They mocked his appearance, calling him a "fat fuck" and commenting on his ill-fitting suit.  They played Bubba’s audio clips, highlighting what they perceived as his backpedaling and damage control.


The conversation then shifted to pornographic film titles, with Patrice O'Neal participating, noting their often overtly racist and offensive nature. The hosts then watched and commented on a pornographic video with graphic detail and highly offensive language, focusing on race, body types, and sexual acts.  They attempted to locate and display another pornographic video online, referred to as the "booyah video" or "dog in a bathtub" video.


The show concluded with a graphic discussion and commentary of a pornographic video titled "Sorry Wrong Hole," detailing the accidental anal penetration of a woman.  The hosts used vulgar and offensive language, describing the sounds and reactions in explicit detail. A caller, possibly named Danny, contributed to the discussion.  They briefly mentioned Patrice O'Neal's upcoming stand-up appearances and a listener contest for a SummerSlam trip.  The segment ended with banter, closing remarks, and frequent use of the catchphrase "booyah."  Patrice O'Neal remained a guest throughout this final portion of the show.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  I say he snorts up the baby cockroaches.  Yeah, snoring cockroaches would be good.  Here we go.  The sounds of Steve.  All I can say is this is why Steve is not here today.  Built to a crescendo.  Sure.  What is that?  What was that?  What are you talking about?  Did you see that?  What happened?  What?  There's a bunny rabbit.  What is there, a bunny rabbit?  Where are you going? 
[00:00:30]  I've got to get out of here.  Come on, Bobby.  Bobby.  Bobby.  You're driving me on the show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Let's get the show on the road.  Good morning.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  We've got lots to do today.  It's Monday, August 4th.  Christ.  Hi.  I just realized it's my dad's birthday.  Oh, no.  You just realized?  Holy ass.  Yeah, holy ass.  Happy birthday.  Happy birthday, Pops. 
[00:01:00]  He had a confusion.  He's dead.  Yes, Patrice.  But I just realized it's his birthday today.  He's dead.  A little uncomfy.  I just realized, though.  Phone number 877-212-ONA.  It sucks.  Well, we're going to talk about the virus show.  So let's start with Gambit from New York.  Gambit, you're the first call of the week.  What's up, buddy?  Hey, I just want to say it was the best time that I've had in years at the virus show. 
[00:01:30]  But I also wanted to inquire to him about a certain jewelry accoutrement to gentlemen  wearing it back to the future.  Sure.  Percent of him with when he arrives.  Oh, I was so thrilled.  I got a Hill Valley High School graduation ring since, you know, I didn't get one from my  own high school.  Yeah.  I got a nice one from Hill Valley High, which, of course, is, you know, back to the future.  Yeah.  And somebody gave it to me, and I thought it was very good.  Thank you.  You were wearing it on your wedding ring finger. 
[00:02:00]  Well, I was just wearing it on one finger that fit.  I know, but that got some people talking.  They're like, what's up with the ring on Anthony's wedding ring finger?  I'm like, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what the hell's going on with him.  Yeah, it was good.  Yeah.  I gave me that.  I like gifts from the listeners.  Very, very nice.  Especially funny ones.  Well, everyone is saying the phones are lit already.  Look, we'll take another one.  Justin in Jersey.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, what's going on, guys?  Hey, man.  I was at the show on Saturday, and can I tell you, it was the greatest comedy show I've 
[00:02:30]  ever seen in my entire life.  Oh, very good.  I'm glad you enjoyed it, because that was the last one as well.  I want to make it official.  That was the last ONA virus show ever.  Because it's gotten to the point.  Well, thank you, Justin.  Well, Justin, what was your favorite part before we get into this?  When Jimmy, right before Jimmy came on stage, when we all blew that one guy off the stage.  Well, that was his favorite part. 
[00:03:00]  Hence, the last virus show you guys will ever see.  Because we cannot turn the listeners around to the point where they can understand what  we're trying to do here.  Like, we invite these comedians in to our house, the ONA community.  They are friends of Anthony and I's.  They are friends of the show.  We pick guys that we think people will enjoy.  And then the audience, because they don't like somebody, turns around and boos the hell 
[00:03:30]  out of them.  Viciously booze them.  And here's another thing.  And they don't understand, in the end, what that does.  And we're going to get into this today.  Here's another thing.  They, we got like complaints when we first announced the tour, before we announced any  new comics that were coming on.  Right.  From people going, you know, it's the same lineup.  What, am I going to go again and see Patrice and Jimmy?  It's like, no, we'll get some other guys in there. 
[00:04:00]  The second we bring someone new on stage, these jackasses just pounce like hyena.  Yeah.  First of all, they boo us.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And they still boo the guys.  Patrice has been doing our show for, what, six to eight years.  Oh, my God.  And he's scared to go in front of the ONA crowd.  It really is.  And, and let me go with what Anthony said, as we were trying to get comedians this year  for the ONA comedy show, a lot of well-known comics said no to this show. 
[00:04:30]  Yes.  And the reason they said no, it came up over and over again, was because they were scared  S-less of our audience.  Yeah.  They don't want to stand in front of there and get pounded.  And we're talking about well-known comedians that turn around, I don't even want to give  names today, that said, no effing way am I doing that show.  So these idiots that, that think it's so cool to boo the comedians or one comedian, we almost  had a good show.  We almost had a perfect show. 
[00:05:00]  Everything was going great.  Mike Birbiglia went on stage and, uh, once again, they started booing before they gave  the guy a chance.  And that's, that's my biggest complaint with this whole thing.  If you give a guy a few minutes and then you don't like him, you know what?  I can't tell you not to boo.  But what I can tell people is why are you booing before you give some of these guys a  chance in our house?  It's our house.  And when I say our house, I mean the fans, Anthony and I, the rest of the comedians, our 
[00:05:30]  house.  Just imagine you like, uh, have someone over for Thanksgiving, you invite them into your  house.  And then as they're trying to eat Turkey, you're like, boo, get out.  But, but you invited me here.  And they, they were welling up.  Huh?  They were welling up because they just, it was just 10,000 innate boos in there anyway.  Yeah.  And, and, and they were just welling up, dude.  And, and here's the deal with, uh, Mike Birbiglia. 
[00:06:00]  The video of him getting booed is up on YouTube and people are checking it out.  The message boards are going crazy over it.  Mike Birbiglia is a well-established comedian.  I saw him in Central Park killing in front of 2000 people killing.  And, uh, our audience decided now we're not even going to give him a chance.  Well, who's this open mic are coming out.  We're not even going to give him a chance.  What is he, a contest winner?  I think he's a K-Rock contest winner.  They decided to give a local comedian a few minutes just before Jim Norton closed the show. 
[00:06:30]  Oh, we don't want to acknowledge this guy.  Let's, let's, let's, let's boo him to death.  So unfortunately, uh, with that, I got it.  I got to announce that, uh, we just did our last comedy show.  Our last comedy show.  I mean, we'll do the smaller ones maybe.  Or if Patrice is playing Caroline's, we might get up on stage and go, Hey, everybody.  I'm just sitting and watching.  I ain't getting up anymore.  Screw it.  You know, you know what it is?  Uh, and the comics, you could see it backstage when they all come in. 
[00:07:00]  There's this Paul over everything.  There's just this, uh, infectious cloud of who's it going to be.  You believe in God?  I believe in God.  You believe in God?  I believe in God too.  You love Jesus?  I do.  I do love Jesus.  I do.  Yeah.  They're all talking.  And they're all milling around backstage.  And it's not this lighthearted thing.  It's, they're looking at each other like, someone's, someone's dying tonight.  Someone's dying.  And it's, uh, all it reminds me of these days is, is when like Proximo gave the speech 
[00:07:30]  to the gladiators in, in gladiator.  And just as your mother was there at your beginning, I shall be there at your end.  And when you bomb and bomb, you shall, your transition will be to the sounds of, boo, you  suck.  Get off the stage.  Comedians, I salute you.  Can any of you make jokes? 
[00:08:00]  Have any of you done comedy before?  Yes.  I opened for you at Caroline's.  Stick together.  Stick together.  It was just, I swear to you, that's the atmosphere.  You just don't want your mother to get that call.  No.  Knock on the door with your folded flag.  Oh, yeah, I got some bad news. 
[00:08:30]  Stick together.  Stick together.  But that's what it's like backstage.  It's like underneath the Coliseum.  Sure.  Just waiting to pop up and get a big mace in your face the second you come out.  Comedian, what's your name?  And as each comedian got off the stage and came backstage, whatever, they were pretty 
[00:09:00]  much crying.  I made it.  I made it.  They made it.  Oh, thank God.  Hugs.  You know, I had to be like kind of helped off into the back into the green room.  One guy in each arm just helping him, helping him back to the green room like he's a wounded  soldier.  Spider web tattoo.  Right.  I got to look at in the daytime.  Yeah.  I go on in the daytime.  Yeah.  When there's sunshine out.  Yeah, there's still sun out.  I'm just looking at you and I'm just looking at these guys with spider web tattoos and 
[00:09:30]  their eyeballs.  Yeah.  These people who I don't even read the message boards anymore, but you know, they're there.  Those haters.  You know, it's pathetic.  I have to focus.  I look at Greg Giraldo and it's like, you don't want when there's comics that's been doing  comedy forever.  You don't want to look at him and go, hey, kid, here's some advice.  Yeah.  Like 47 of them, I go, listen to me, focus.  That's my advice because you're going, something's going to be happening. 
[00:10:00]  A beach ball, a raping, 10 boings up above, air horns, you suck.  Dude, how about the air horn?  I go to Pete, I'm like, you know, there's a guy out there with an air horn kind of disturbing  every single comedian.  And Pete goes, yeah, I know.  It's kind of cool.  He goes, it's kind of cool.  It's kind of cool.  Like, you know.  Because he's not doing it during the jokes, just as a punchline.  Like, it's kind of cool.  Punchline?  How about the comic does the punchline? 
[00:10:30]  You know what's kind of cool?  I'm never doing one of those again.  That's what I find kind of cool.  I'd love to go to where that guy works and just blow an air horn as he's trying to frigging  fill out his TPS reports.  It's kind of cool.  Faggot.  Don't you think it's kind of cool?  I'm like, no, it's disturbing the comedians.  It's not kind of cool.  People who've never done comedy, sick of me.  Just, hey, what's the problem?  Be funny.  Hey, go ahead.  Hey, funny man.  When somebody 57 is showing their breasts while you're on, let me just focus through 
[00:11:00]  this 15 minutes while somebody's grandmother wants an Otto and George t-shirt and just shows  you those rotten pieces.  Utters.  Getting back to, like, as we were trying to get this lineup together, and a lot of guys  that did the show in years past and had a good time, they just said, no way, because  they couldn't handle the pressure and the buildup leading to the show, wondering if these  asses are going to boo them.  That's what it is.  And then we started getting weird excuses, like, so, you know, could you do the comedy 
[00:11:30]  show, you know, for us at the PNC?  He goes, no, no, no, I got a set of chuckles I got to do in Akron, Ohio.  I'm like, what?  Why would you go to Chuckles in Akron, Ohio, making up a, you know, comedy name here, instead  of playing in front of 10,000 people?  Because they're not going to get the equivalent of a shovel in the face.  I'd rather do 47 shows at Chuckles.  Right.  The one 15 minutes.  And I saw a few in Montreal, by the way, remain nameless, who were almost saying, hey, 
[00:12:00]  I was supposed to do that, but it was almost like, hey, but I had to do something else.  But they'd left out the detail of, thank God, you had something else to do.  What'd you have to do?  I had to buy some bubblegum.  Yeah, very busy.  It's Saskatchewan.  In the comedy world, it's becoming the thing.  These guys are all chattering among themselves, and like, you're doing the show?  What, are you insane?  You're crazy.  I can't believe you're actually going to try to do that. 
[00:12:30]  And then another guy gave us an excuse, a big-time comedian.  He's like, I got a black party that weekend.  I'm like, all right, something's up.  Go for it.  Here's Sonny Farrelly from Boston, Massachusetts.  Sonny.  Hey, guys.  What's happening, man?  Hey, man.  Good seeing you on Saturday.  What's up, Sonny?  I'll tell you, I was thoroughly, thoroughly disgusted.  And, Patrice, I just want to correct you a little bit.  You said you did mention about the message borders.  For the most part, it wasn't the message borders this time.  That's true. 
[00:13:00]  I just want to say that.  I mean, I have to give credit.  I have to give credit to – this is what I mean.  When I say focus, there are – I think it was the most I ever seen at the PNC.  It was completely filled.  Like, I mean, it was crazy.  Yeah.  It was a real rock concert type of thing, the most, because I guess it's not spread out  anymore, so people are coming from everywhere in that tri-state or whatever.  And the focus means there are going to be about 2,000 that hate you and 9,000 that love you. 
[00:13:30]  So focus on the 9,000.  Right.  So it seems like we're trashing the entire audience.  Hold on, Sonny.  You seem like you're trashing the entire audience.  It's not.  It's just 2,000 people that you have to focus out and give a great performance of people  that's seen you 25 times and know you well enough to go, Patrice wasn't on top of his  game today, or Bobby wasn't on top of his game today, or wow, they were great today, 
[00:14:00]  even due to the fact of beach balls and air horns and you suck and old ladies.  That's what I mean.  So the ones that were great, I say they were the best, let me, just to say this, the best  crowd ever, other than two years ago at the PNC, this is the number one audience.  You really like the audience, huh?  They were beautiful.  They were material.  I mean, Brewer was doing stuff about his kids, and they were beautiful, but they were good 
[00:14:30]  for that crowd.  Right on.  Sonny, what were you saying?  We don't know who booed.  I'm not saying it was the message boarders.  I'm not saying it's the satellite radio crew.  I'm not saying it's regular radio.  I have no idea.  But the fact remains that all the people that went to the show on Saturday know this radio  show pretty well and know that we were pretty much telling everyone, could you do us a favor  and not boo the comedians?  Because we're really trying to keep this thing going past this year.  And at this point, we have to say, that was the last virus show. 
[00:15:00]  There's no way we could do this anymore.  No.  Comedians were saying no to us that should not be saying no to us.  You could do it again.  And that's why it was the seasoned veterans that we brought to the PNC.  We brought the best of the best.  The seasoned vets.  Don't joke, man.  Guys that have been doing this radio show for eight to ten years.  You guys have to audition.  Well, like I wrote on the message board, all right?  For those who did boo Mike Verviglia, all right?  A big F you. 
[00:15:30]  You're an effing douche.  And you should go suck your father's bleep.  Oh, Jesus.  After he effed you, that fellow trash mother that got AIDS from effing the family dog.  He said the F word and then said bleep in place of ass.  Yeah, I know.  You are a dummy.  Go away.  But thank you, Sonny.  I know Sonny was not happy.  I know Sonny wasn't happy with what went on with the booing with Mike Verviglia. 
[00:16:00]  And we were starting to feel pretty good.  We're like, oh, my God.  It's happening.  Oh, my God.  We're making it.  We're making it.  We're going to get through this.  The audience is loving it because that's the feeling backstage.  Like, okay, I think we're going to get through this.  And I start hearing booing.  And I come out to the backstage area, but I can't see who's on stage.  And then all it is, it's like it's this thing.  I go up to Oak and go, who's out there?  He goes, Perpiglia.  I'm like, oh, he's.  It's like, oh, Perpiglia is getting it.  It's like watching an old war movie.  Who's out there in the brush? 
[00:16:30]  It's Kowalski.  Right.  They got Kowalski.  In fairness to Perpiglia, there's no one under, when they get a fat one at the ONA shows,  nobody, it's no one laughs.  No one goes, ah-ha.  It's just, you bring him in and you go, you give him that shot of Novocaine.  Yep.  And you try to put his guts back in.  Yeah.  Medic.  And you take him to the chopper. 
[00:17:00]  To the chopper.  To the chopper.  To the chopper.  To the chopper.  That's what I was sort of saying after they left the stage.  They looked like they needed a medic.  Nobody, like, after that, it's just like no one, you know, Billy took that thing and made  it into some incredible.  And that's what I think everyone's trying to recreate.  It's like, it ain't gonna happen, dummies.  That was magic when we did.  Yeah.  Magic.  It can't happen again.  No.  It's funny because a few people on the phones, I think one of our own guys, Butcher, just 
[00:17:30]  wrote that about the sweatshirt, right?  Yeah.  They're trying to justify why they booed Mike Brubigley at the big show on Saturday night  at the PNC.  They're basically saying we booed him because he walked out on stage with a hoodie on and  it was 100 degrees out.  Well, all right.  Boo away.  Boo away then.  This is what we're up against.  This is why I feel good saying that we did the last virus show.  We did 14 or 15 of those.  I was trying to count last night. 
[00:18:00]  I think 15.  It's over.  It's done.  That information is pertinent, by the way, because I was going to wear a suit jacket.  So they would have booed me due to that information.  Oh, my God.  A suit jacket.  Hi.  How are you people?  Hey.  Sir Patrice here.  Hi, guy.  Part of the YouTube video of Mike Brubigley getting booed, and we'll link it on on  OneDayRadio.com, one of the guys, Mike Brubigley, decided to ask why they're booing.  So God bless him.  He went in the crowd.  And one guy goes, because you're wearing a sweats or hoodie. 
[00:18:30]  A giant killer, by the way.  That guy is, I'm sitting here doing the cross over my chest for Mike when he did that.  Yeah.  I'm like, oh, my God.  They're going to beat him up.  And not even Kenny is going to be able to stop him.  No.  They're going to beat up Mike Brubigley.  They're just going to kill him.  Those were guys that beat Mike Brubigley as up.  Sure.  The phones are lit.  Let's say how to Spyro or Spiro.  Spiro, Long Island.  What's up?  Good morning, gentlemen. 
[00:19:00]  I had an excellent time.  Patrice, I never saw you before, but that was fantastic, sir.  It was fantastic.  Thank you.  But I think you take that same crowd and put them inside of a comedy club.  They're just going to sit there with their little mouth shut, sipping their drinks, because  they're scared the bouncer's going to beat their ass.  How about a big you're wrong?  What's that?  How about a big you're wrong?  Yeah.  Dude, as you put them in there, one thing they're not is like, it's not a lot of phonies. 
[00:19:30]  And here's the thing, they're split up into who likes who in the comedy clubs.  And so, out of all the comics that come on the show, mostly just your fans will show  up, not the ones that's going to boo you.  But those dudes, they will do it if they decide to.  They're not going to sit there and just be quiet.  I've seen it.  I just, I think we deserve not to have another virus show. 
[00:20:00]  Look at him.  We deserve it.  No, honestly, I'm not kidding.  We can't have another one, because it's gotten to the point, we had a really tough time getting  this lineup together.  That's why it was a lot of guys, and we wanted all these guys that you saw, but we were also  trying to spice it up with some big names and some other people that are well-known in  the comedy world, and they all said no to us.  Not because they don't like us.  All these guys do the show from time to time, but they're just, they've heard all the stories  and the chattering that's going on. 
[00:20:30]  I don't blame them.  And even these guys that have done the radio show for so long.  I mean, backstage, they were all, they had that look on their faces, like Ant was saying,  that they were pretty much going to battle and hoping to get through it.  Hoping to get through it so they could go home for the holidays and see their family  again.  That's all they were thinking.  It's kind of exhilarating, though, because you do get complacent.  That 10,000 maniacs, the 10,000 fathers of Freddy Krueger out there.  But when they do, it is, it is exhilarating, man. 
[00:21:00]  It is, it's just when they love you, it is something to behold.  It's just, it really is a great thing, but it's just that nerve wracking.  In the end, the fans are going to do what they're going to do.  I understand that.  But they sometimes, sometimes, this is all I've ever asked.  You got to, you got to look at the bigger picture and realize what this ends up doing  in the end.  It winds up, we don't do another show.  Because we can't get the right guys anymore.  No. 
[00:21:30]  We just can't get the right guys.  They don't want to go into it.  These are comics that have gotten on airplanes and flown to Iraq.  Right.  They have done shows under mortar fire.  They have flown into Baghdad Airport in military maneuvers in C-130s that are,  the scariest landings you'll ever have.  Yeah.  Yet they don't want to get in front of our crowd.  Yeah.  And comics who do an hour and 10, hour 15, hour 20 on stage, regular basis, 
[00:22:00]  five shows in a row, the 10 to 15 minutes you had to do as there's a big clock  in front of you, you're counting down and you're praying as each joke does well.  Yeah.  And some of the, you know, I could say this.  Some of the names that said no, that shouldn't have said no.  So, Nick DiPaolo, David Tell, Bob Saget, okay?  Jimmy Fallon was going to be our special guest, by the way. 
[00:22:30]  Yeah.  And I think he heard the chatter.  He did, right?  He heard the chatter and also was like,  no, I got to go out to LA and I got to start practicing  because I'm taking over for Conan O'Brien on the internet.  That was his excuse.  Yeah.  He was basically saying, I can't do this.  I'm too freaked out by your audience.  Of course.  Jimmy effing Fallon.  Vicious.  We want to go, ladies and gentlemen, Jimmy Fallon.  He really wanted to do it, but then he started asking around and all of a sudden,  man, the excuses came on. 
[00:23:00]  Oh, yeah.  So, what's this all about?  What's this?  And he must have heard like, oh, you're not going to, no, you're not going to do that.  And there were other guys as well that said no that are right up there with the names I just mentioned.  Norman, New Jersey, what's up?  Hey, what's up, man?  Norman.  What's up, buddy?  Yo, yo, I'm just trying to, I'm with Patrice, like, you've got to focus.  Like, this isn't only a crowd, you guys are a comedy show.  You guys bring a lot of comedy to us, so like, you know, we're hard to impress. 
[00:23:30]  And that's not our fault.  That really isn't our fault.  We threw, we threw, we threw like 10 guys at you.  You couldn't sit through one guy that you might have been out of line.  One guy near the end of the show.  You couldn't help us out and just get through it.  Because then we would have a great story to tell.  We're like, guys, to all the comedians out there, good news, 10,000 people at the PNC.  No one got booed.  People are saying it's one of the best shows they've ever seen.  And that would have made it easy to book this thing next year.  Instead, now we have to officially say you saw the last one. 
[00:24:00]  All right, all right.  But what I'm saying is, I mean, like, I met you at a Dane Cook show,  and I watched you watching Dane Cook during that show,  and I'm thinking, look at, oh, he's seen so much comedy  that he's watching Dane Cook right now, and he ain't even laughing.  I watched you that whole show, bro.  You didn't laugh at all.  Yeah, but did he boo, you idiot?  Well, yeah, you didn't boo.  But I'm saying that's the mentality.  We're dumb animals.  We are.  But, you know, you've got to impress us.  We're the O and A.  No, we don't.  We set up a show.  They're funny comics.  And if one doesn't float your goddamn boat, you sit there, drink a beer, 
[00:24:30]  look at your white trash girlfriend or whatever you want to do.  But booing the guys is stupid.  Dude, it's stupid.  And, Norman, hold on, because I've got to defend myself.  I think Dane Cook's a very funny comic.  I see so much comedy that I'm not sure.  Shut up!  I don't know what show.  No, I'll explain something.  I don't know what show you saw me where I wasn't laughing at Dane Cook, 
[00:25:00]  but I also look at some of these guys in a different way,  and I study what they're doing on stage,  and I'm almost not paying attention to the jokes  because I like to see how some of these guys, you know, work a room.  Like, Dane Cook was doing Madison Square Garden with just him and a stool,  and I found that fascinating.  And that's what I was kind of studying, like, wow, all right.  I was watching his body movements and his body language.  Okay, so you're telling me...  Boo! I hate your phone call!  Boo!  Boo!  Boo! Your phone call sucks!  Dude, have a better phone call! 
[00:25:30]  Boo!  Ass.  Guy's trying to make a point why he booed the comedians  because he expects more.  Go screw yourself.  It's too bad because, you know, this virus show thing we really enjoy doing.  It's fun!  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  It's over.  And we kind of really asked for a favor after the animation festival  when they booed Dan Natterman.  First of all, we were throwing a few comedians at you 
[00:26:00]  just to break up all the animations we did at the animation festival.  Yeah.  And we decided, you know, this guy's a little quirky, a little strange,  but he's pretty popular in the comedy world.  Yeah, let's throw Dan Natterman out there.  The audience will at least give him a chance.  They didn't even give him a chance.  And even then, we're like, all right, please don't do that anymore.  Please.  Because there's a bigger picture here we're trying to protect.  And quite frankly, from a comic standpoint, Dan Natterman's situation, 
[00:26:30]  it may have been the funniest dealing with a booing I've ever heard.  He started doing Shakespeare, which was almost genius.  It made me laugh so hard that he would do what he did, man.  But that one at the PNC, you almost want to go out and give a speech.  One of those, hey, hey now.  Hey, what are you doing?  What are you doing?  Because it was just like, what the hell?  All right, really fast, because we've got to take a break. 
[00:27:00]  Gladys saw the virus show in Vegas before you canceled the tour.  Fans were like two-year-olds.  They just wanted to do the Bill Burr moment over and over.  We talked about that.  Burbiglia was overwhelmed by the crowd size.  I was there.  Y'all, white boys, party different.  But Burbiglia didn't fit in.  Burbiglia, get booed, was awful.  Fans should give him a chance.  Don't take virus tour away just because of this.  We had a tough time booking this one.  And the reason was because the comedians know what happens to some of them. 
[00:27:30]  And I'm sad to say it's over.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over, Johnny.  Let's say hi to Garrett on Long Island.  It's over, Johnny.  It's over.  Garrett.  Yeah, what's up?  Hi, how are you guys?  Good.  I saw the show Saturday.  It was bloody brilliant.  I loved it.  My friend and I saw it.  But we were so bloody, it was so bloody awful about Mike Burbiglia.  And I was just, I'm somewhat ashamed to say I was part of that crowd, even though it was a great show. 
[00:28:00]  I was so sad because he was on the show a week or two ago and he was saying how afraid he was that this was going to happen to him.  Well, we really needed a perfect show.  And we were backstage kind of like high-fiving and everyone's kind of nodding like, look, look, see, this is good.  And that would have ended the feeling some of these comedians get.  That would have ended it and we would have been able to book whoever the F we wanted next year. 
[00:28:30]  You know what the problem was?  Also, he was backstage and he was going up to people going, hey, did you see a picture of my best gal?  I'm going to see her when I get back home.  I'm going to marry Mary Sue when I get home.  Here's a picture of her.  Oh, never do that.  Take a good look at this lump of you.  Bag him and tag him.  Let's go to Adam in Jersey.  Adam.  You wear a hoodie out on stage and I'll get you a one-way trip out of the bush. 
[00:29:00]  But he was sleeping.  I guarantee.  Adam.  Hey, I think Wrigley was just a bad choice.  I've seen Mike Wrigley before.  He's a funny guy.  I just think it was a bad choice to have on that show.  His comedy system did well.  Well, Adam, after 20 comedians said no because of what they've been hearing,  the rumors they've been hearing, you know, I thought it was a great choice. 
[00:29:30]  I knew beforehand Wrigley was going to get booed.  I mean, a lot of people did.  It's just comedy.  They did neck frown.  Well, you know, some – I don't think – we tried.  I don't think it's ever going to – people got to understand the big picture  and they don't understand the big picture.  And now we have to say goodbye to the virus show.  You think you know about bombing?  Well, come on, pothead.  Tell me about bombing.  Let's take our first break. 
[00:30:00]  We got lots to do today.  We got Larry King drunk tapes.  Remember that beheading story?  We got police tapes of the beheading.  Oh, we'll explain.  Yeah, it took a funnier turn than just cutting the guy's head off.  We do a whole black-white thing on this show,  and we got Patricia O'Neill sitting in for Jimmy,  who's out doing the Bob Saget roast.  Flying back today, I believe.  He'll be in tomorrow.  But, man, it's always crazy white, dude.  No, it wasn't.  This is – 
[00:30:30]  What was he?  Oh, no, was he –  He was a big, giant Asian or some Eskimo or something.  Canadian.  No, he was –  Was he one of the –  He was.  The natives?  He was something.  Canadian Native –  Canadian –  Canadian Native American.  Is that what you were going to say?  He wasn't a white boy.  Yeah, was he a Canadian Native American?  Oh, he was a big Asian guy.  Big Asian, man.  Wow.  Wow, really?  That doesn't fit the profile.  Nope.  I would have bet $10,000 it was a white boy. 
[00:31:00]  Just crazy white guy, yeah.  Nope.  People are saying that they might have just got a little uncomfortable  after our dumb car giveaway.  Where Pete's like, no, no, this is great.  No, it'll be great in the back parking lot.  Oh, we'll get into that after the break.  Without the camera going out, the car giveaway thing wasn't all that bad.  Well, how about you make sure the camera doesn't go out?  I know.  This is a professional effing show.  We were making some funny jokes about the people and stuff, but yeah.  We'll explain that after the break.  Yeah. 
[00:31:30]  We'll explain that after the break, too.  Patrice O'Neal sitting in today.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Stay there.  Patrice O'Neal.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show.  877-212-ON-A.  I want to say hi to all the fans I ended up meeting on Saturday.  Yeah.  We just killed a lot of people, but the fact remains that we met a lot of cool people.  A lot of appreciative people.  A lot of...  A lot of...  Huh?  Yeah.  K-Rock girls were quite... 
[00:32:00]  They were rocking.  They were partying out in the lot again, which was really cool, hanging out.  This year's strippers.  Yeah.  A lot of ones that look like Peg Bundy.  Peg Bundy.  And stripper clothes.  Oh, God.  There was one that was just a mess.  Not to be unappreciative, but there was a couple of aunties.  Auntie?  Hi, Auntie Buttcheeks.  Boy, oh, boy. 
[00:32:30]  It was a couple of cruddy ones.  It was some delicious ones.  Yeah.  But the K-Rock girls, for the most part, I would say, was batting Hall of Fame numbers,  even upon baseball, probably 80%.  Yeah, very good.  Young, delicious, brand-new girls.  There was a couple of cheese balls that was floating around.  I think the K-Rock girls are going to be coming in here in...  This week?  Next week?  No, three weeks.  In a few weeks.  And we're going to, like, help pick the K-Rock team.  Yes.  All right, yeah.  So we're going to have fun with that.  Yeah, of course.  And we'll get back to the discussion on the virus show that happened Saturday at the PNC Bank Art Center. 
[00:33:00]  People are just waking up.  The headline, if you were there, you just saw the last one.  Simple as that.  We can't go on.  No.  We just can't.  We can't go on.  We can't.  And you know what?  We did good.  We did 14 or 15, I believe, of those things.  And we did good.  Unless you hold a comedy draft.  Well, maybe we come up with some new idea.  Maybe we all just go camping. 
[00:33:30]  Let's just do a camp trip.  So we found out late last week that good old Fareed, he sort of was a friend of ours, sort of.  I don't consider him a friend of mine whatsoever.  The only time the guy called me in the last two years, by the way, was for my birthday.  Now, I said happy birthday.  And I said, I even said to him at the time, I go, Fareed, where the F have you been?  All hell is breaking loose with your company.  All hell is breaking loose with the people you left in charge to decide what markets Anthony and I should be in. 
[00:34:00]  And they're taking us out of all your markets.  Where the F have you been?  I've been in hiding, he says.  I don't, I'm not friendly with people like this.  It's strictly business.  I understand that.  But this, this is no way to do business.  I have not heard hiding our hair from this guy in I don't know how long.  And all he's doing has been yanking us off of all of his stations. 
[00:34:30]  For some reason.  What, is it us goofing on the crap stock?  That we bought in at $19 a share and it's down into pennies now?  Is that it?  Was it a take the money and run friggin' pump and dump that you got us into?  They're Fareed.  Because for some reason, even business wise, not even talking friendly.  Fareed's the head of Citadel Broadcasting. 
[00:35:00]  Which I call something else that sounds like Citadel.  Yes.  When we got in, the shares were $19 a share.  That was the IPO and I believe it went up to $21.22, I think was as high.  Should have bailed.  Maybe we can pick that up.  Should have bailed right there.  Now it's around a dollar a share.  A dollar a share.  So that shows you what's going on with this company.  Go ahead, Anthony.  Anthony was in a good rant there.  It's awful.  And business is one thing, but there is also some kind of professional courtesy.  I'm not even calling it a friendship.  It's professional courtesy that you should get a call from the CEO or even somebody else. 
[00:35:30]  Judy Ellis.  That's right.  Judy Ellis, his crony there.  Actually, I'll throw another name at you.  Kevin LeGrette.  I sort of go back with him, but I always thought he was kind of a phony.  He's like good friends with Brother Weez, and he runs the Syracuse station, the Buffalo station.  So when all that was going down, I got his email.  I go, Kevin, you've got to be kidding me.  What the F is going on?  Why don't you give me a call or at least write me back and explain what the F is going on? 
[00:36:00]  Professional courtesy.  Professional courtesy like Ann's saying.  Never got an email back.  The guy hid.  Haven't heard anything except from Google news alerts that tell me that, oh, and the show is off in this Citadel market or this Citadel market.  And a lot of people are like, what's with O&A?  They're getting like booted from all their markets.  It's like, no, we're getting booted from the Citadel markets.  That's the company that has decided they are taking us off the air and putting these slappy and wappy shows on that are going to tank. 
[00:36:30]  Mark my words, they're going to tank.  Well, in Syracuse, they put a show on called Shut Up and Rock.  Shut Up and Rock, where they have such faith in the jocks that they just want them to shut up and play music.  So if this doesn't show you how dumb this company is, they decided that they're going to compete with iPods.  That's brilliant.  Yeah.  And then in Buffalo, the PD, who I'm relatively friendly with, he wrote me a couple times when all that was going down.  He goes, dude, they're making me do mornings. 
[00:37:00]  I haven't done a radio air shift since college.  Since college.  So then it leads to this Grand Rapids, Michigan situation.  Yeah.  We got a Google alert that we're being replaced in Grand Rapids, Michigan by a show called Gray and Cluck.  And Gray and Cluck are claiming to be the edgiest show on radio.  Yeah.  Wow.  I got to hear some of this edginess.  And it's another Fareed slash Citadel move.  So we figure, all right, what the hell? 
[00:37:30]  Let's listen to Gray and Cluck.  They must be the brand new Howard Stern.  They have to be if they're the edgiest show on radio.  Edgiest show on radio.  And I like what they said about, you know, because all these guys bring up the local angle.  And that's what it is.  Like they get rid of us and go, yeah, we're going local.  And it's like, because people have wanted local radio for Western Michigan.  Yeah.  I sit there and go, for Western Michigan?  Ready?  They want local?  Here's Gray and Cluck.  All right.  Let's sample some Greg and Cluck.  This is what replaced us. 
[00:38:00]  You know, when you get replaced by maybe Sean Hannity or Rush Limbaugh, which has happened in the past,  you're like, okay, well-established show.  And they're obviously taking a whole different direction with this radio station.  They decide to go into, you know, politics.  And all that.  Yeah.  But to replace us with Gray and Cluck, it just shows you that your company is doomed and you have no effing clue what you're doing.  And one of the guys is the frigging program director, which makes a disastrous show. 
[00:38:30]  Well, because they're trying to save some bucks.  Of course.  So they get the program director to also host the morning show.  And the sad part is they weren't paying us much money.  No.  Not that we're crying poverty.  Trust me.  But when you know what you're making and then they boot you to put the program director on the air and pay him just a little less than they were paying Opie and Anthony,  what is wrong with your company?  We were doing that douchebag, Fareed, a favor.  And let me be honest with you.  Oh, oh, oh, wait a minute.  I used the DB word.  So I'll do it again. 
[00:39:00]  Hold on.  Hold on.  We were doing that douche, Fareed, a favor.  Believe me.  It was nickels and dimes just to go on his stations to do him.  He frigging contacted us that he wanted us on his stations.  And we were doing well.  And then he figures, you know, instead of nickels and dimes, he'll get these guys and pay him pennies and bring him on and try to save his company.  Because his stock went from $19 down to $0.85. 
[00:39:30]  And that means we got to go and they got to drag in program directors and janitors to do morning shows.  Save money.  And that's the bottom line.  They're doing this to save money.  And, you know, I hope it works for you.  Well, let's see.  Let's see if it's working for him.  This is some audio of Gray and Cluck.  These guys replaced us.  Gray and Cluck.  Ugh.  Hey, I know I have a dopey radio name, but it's a dumb nickname I got when I was 12. 
[00:40:00]  These guys actually come up with names like this, thinking it's going to be the next great thing in radio.  Gray and Cluck, everyone.  Top of the morning.  What's up?  6.02 Monday, I believe that I had the world's worst night of sleep ever.  Yeah?  Yeah.  I don't think I shut my eyes for more than about 11 and a half minutes at any point during the night.  One of those where you look at the clock and go, hmm, seven minutes since the last time I looked at the clock.  Yeah, that sucks.  Hey, look.  Six more minutes of my life has gone by. 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Well, that'll be fun to deal with today.  Yeah.  You just heard the edgiest show on radio, Gray and Cluck.  Pew, pew, pew, Gray and Cluck in the mornings.  They actually said the edgiest show on radio.  We're going to be abrasive, they said.  Yeah.  They're going to take it to the edge, man.  And the guy, I didn't sleep for more than 11 minutes.  Anthony hasn't slept since February.  Right.  Shut it. 
[00:41:00]  Tired of it.  I'm going to tell you.  My God.  Gray and Cluck.  Pew, pew.  That's why they use a lot of lasers in their station promos.  Pew, pew, pew.  Or the deep voice.  Gray and Cluck.  You're not going to believe what you hear.  Mornings.  Want to hear more Gray and Cluck?  Who doesn't?  Patrice?  Gray and Cluck?  Thumbs up, right?  That's what I'm quiet for.  I want to...  All right.  And that's after a weekend in which I had to go see my brother-in-law's new house. 
[00:41:30]  That was my crowning achievement.  The edgiest show on radio.  He's seeing his brother's house.  He's seeing his brother's house.  Pew, choo, choo.  Holy Jesus.  My crowning achievement was spending four hours on the road for an hour and a half worth  of barbecuing in Howell, Michigan.  Ooh, Howell.  Yeah.  That's the local angle.  Okay.  I'll give him that.  I didn't know where Howell, Michigan is. 
[00:42:00]  I don't want to know where Howell, Michigan is.  I never...  At least we admit we don't want to know where Howell, Michigan is.  Not one time did we talk about Howell, Michigan, Opie.  Therein lies our mistake.  Right.  Gray and Cluck.  They barbecue on weekends.  Ooh!  Choo, choo, choo, choo.  They sit in traffic.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Former home to the KKK.  It's the only thing Howell's known for.  Yeah.  And this station actually broadcasts all the way to Howell, which I was surprised at.  Really?  Yeah, because it's over...  I mean, just the other side of Ann Arbor. 
[00:42:30]  Uh-oh.  It always blows my mind how far you can get with 50,000 watts.  Like, you can cover, you know, a third of the state.  Mostly what blew my mind was the fact that every time I've talked smack about my brother-in-law  that he might actually be sitting in his driveway going...  No, he's probably not.  The easiest show on radio.  Gay and Suck.  Pew, pew.  Morning.  He shut the radio off and went in the house.  He's not waiting in the driveway for this.  No.  No.  I take pride in the fact when we meet some of our fans and they're like, dude, Friday 
[00:43:00]  when you were doing that thing, I had to sit in my driveway for an hour.  Yeah.  It doesn't happen all the time, but it's one of those nice moments.  They're not sitting in their driveway over this crap.  Great luck.  After two hours, 15 minutes of waiting alongside the road to get onto the lake, I finally make  it up to the entrance gate of the launch.  I'm thinking, okay, well, it's only 10 cars now.  I'll be money in like three hours.  And that's what I remembered, that I may have very well moved the keys to my boat up to 
[00:43:30]  Grand Rapids with me.  So we stop, we get out, go back to the boat, uncover it, flip it inside out.  Sure enough, I did move the keys to Grand Rapids.  No, you didn't.  No, stop.  No, you didn't.  This is some of the most edgy, abrasive radio I've ever heard.  I've ever heard.  They're taking it to the limit for a lose my effing number.  Buddy, I heard you talking about lose my number.  I don't need you, and obviously you don't need us.  Enough with them. 
[00:44:00]  You know what you're doing with gray and cluck mornings, Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Not even the common decency to give a call and say what, why, how, who.  I didn't move the keys to Grand Rapids.  I just grabbed all the crap, threw it in a box, moved it up here.  I wasn't even thinking.  Well, dude, your friend didn't stab you, so consider yourself lucky.  No, he gave me one of those looks like, dude.  Dude!  Dude!  Dude!  Exactly, Patrice, just eat. 
[00:44:30]  Just eat.  Well, in this next track, we've got two left, guys, and then we're going to move on to other things.  Cluck gets edgy and talks about what he did instead of getting on his boat, because, see, he left his keys in.  I know he did.  Wow!  He left them in Grand Rapids.  And he wasn't anywhere near Grand Rapids.  No!  Wow!  Let's find out what he ended up doing.  Yeah, dude, I'll take a barbecue with my brother-in-law and howl over that any day.  It was the worst.  So I did what any self-respecting piece of white trash would do. 
[00:45:00]  We went to Dollar General, bought a bunch of kiddie pools, and set them up in the yard.  Of your new place or down in Kalamazoo?  My buddy's house down in Kalamazoo.  So we got like a couple.  Boy, they are keeping it local.  Let me tell you, I've heard more Michigan cities than I've ever heard in what amounts to probably a minute and a half.  Oh, are they keeping it up?  They probably was like, look, first, we are going to get out there, and we are going to just mention every goddamn city in Michigan. 
[00:45:30]  And they're doing it.  Program director as morning show host equals suck.  Always.  And how about this?  There's a bunch of guys that write for radio because we saw it on the Google Alert.  If a radio show goes, we are the edgiest show on radio, why don't you ask them why they think they're the edgiest show on radio?  Yeah.  What are you doing?  Because talking about lost keys and maybe not sleeping at night and barbecues, I don't know, but I don't find that too edgy.  That's filler. 
[00:46:00]  Right.  They're doing a whole show of filler.  At my buddy's house down in Kalamazoo.  So we got like a couple 30 packs of Natty Light and sat out in the front lawn and kiddie pools, and then we had to slip and slide.  Nice.  Yep.  By the way, that didn't happen.  No, of course it didn't.  The guy had no confidence in his lie that he was about to tell because he had a boring weekend, but he knew he had to come up with something.  Got to say something.  It's Monday. 
[00:46:30]  Jesus.  I did nothing.  And this is typical.  So then you as a jock, you talk about your boring weekend, and then of course it leads to the bit of the morning, and here it is.  It's not very often you can actually disappoint more than 10 of your friends all at once.  So that was fun.  Well played.  Yeah.  If you've got a story that can beat that, let me apologize in advance, and you can call us anytime you want.  800-785-1073 is the number locally here in town.  I'm waiting for one of my friends to call and be like, yeah, I was going to go out to the boat this weekend, and some jackass forgot his keys. 
[00:47:00]  You know how dumb you feel for getting your keys?  Boo!  How dumb do you feel?  Well, I thought that was going to be the next line.  Well, there you go.  Enjoy Gray and Cluck.  There you go, Michigan.  They're setting the radio world on fire.  Way to go, Farid.  Way to go.  That should get the stock up to $1.02.  Yeah.  Pay me, you dumb son of a bitch.  You swindled me. 
[00:47:30]  You swindled me!  Right.  You hire us.  You put us on stations.  You dangle an IPO in front of us.  We buy, buy, buy.  The stock plummets, and then you kick us off all your stations.  Bravo!  For a shyster, you're doing perfect.  For a gentleman and a CEO of a radio company, you suck!  You suck!  God, I hate you!  Well, give him a call.  1-800-785-1073. 
[00:48:00]  What?  For KLQ.  1-800-785-1073.  Gray and Cluck.  And that's why, you know, we play the audio of these shows that replace us, to show you  how ridiculous the radio world is getting.  You know, we're not afraid of what we do with our show, and we're like, all right, here,  we'll throw the audio out there to prove to everyone how ridiculous this whole business  is getting.  And they're actually sitting there, and their stupid offices are literally two or three 
[00:48:30]  buildings away.  They're sitting there way up at the top of one of these buildings thinking, ooh, Gray  and Cluck are going to get the job done.  No, they're not.  No, they're not.  How about you friggin' rent somewhere cheaper to save some money?  You have to be on the friggin' 50th floor with a view and everything?  In Midtown.  All these goddamn radio executives.  That's how you save money.  Get your friggin' executives and put them on a ground floor.  In cubicles.  They all need these spectacular views of the river. 
[00:49:00]  Right.  Oh, well, we gotta cut some corners.  Get me Gray and Cluck.  Get me the program director and, I don't know, an intern.  How about you cut some corners by resigning?  Fareed, you resign.  I know you make a bloody fortune from this company.  Of course.  Judy Ellis, why don't you resign?  How about that?  That would save some money.  Put Gray and Cluck in there.  Right.  Gray could be the CEO.  You know, and Cluck could be the VP of programming. 
[00:49:30]  There you go.  That's saving money.  A lot of money.  You dopes.  Dopes.  But they want to save money, so they throw us off under the guise that they want to go local.  Local means crap in 2008.  I cannot tell you enough how that doesn't make sense.  It's 2008.  There's no such thing as local anymore.  Where you go to a mom and pop store to rent videotapes. 
[00:50:00]  This is not, you know, you go to the general store.  Do you know everybody in the places you go?  It's not local anymore.  You get on the internet.  You watch TV.  It comes from other lands.  Right.  And not a phone call.  Not an email.  Kevin LeGret, you're a joke in this business.  You're an effing joke.  Not even the courtesy of an email back saying, look, it's out of my hands.  This is what we have to do.  Hiding behind your desk, beneath your desk.  You didn't learn too well from Eric Logan or Mr. Karmazin, because I know you worked for Mel as well. 
[00:50:30]  You didn't learn from these guys.  No.  Because when some tough decisions have to be made, guess what?  Mel Karmazin freaking would go face-to-face with us and tell us what was going on.  Eric Logan would do the same thing.  What did you do?  You made believe I didn't send you an email.  We didn't exist.  Just brush it under the carpet, you bunch of frigging.  Citadel executives can suck a fat one. 
[00:51:00]  I frigging, I just, I'm appalled.  I'm appalled by them.  I've never seen a collection of more unprofessional douches than I have that are running Citadel Broadcasting.  That's why your stock's at 85 cents.  Because you suck as executives.  You stink.  You know what's funny, too?  They're paying two morning shows in a lot of these markets, because guess what?  Pay me!  Yeah.  Pay me, mother F.  Pay me. 
[00:51:30]  You have to pay us for a while to come now.  I want my 25 bucks.  Have fun paying us as you have to pay another show, you dopes.  Believe me.  You dopes.  Fareed, lose my number.  We're done.  I think he did.  I haven't gotten a call from him in quite a while.  Hey, buddy.  Happy birthday.  Yeah.  Screw my birthday.  Why don't you tell me what's going on?  Yeah.  How about a little frigging, hey, come on over.  I want to discuss something with you.  Tell you what's going on with the company.  Right, right. 
[00:52:00]  Here's what's...  And I'm not even...  Because I've said this in the past, too.  When shows get blown out, it's one thing.  They don't tell you because there are things going on.  You know, they got to get other people in place.  So they don't tell you.  It's radio.  It's part of the business.  But this situation is different than that.  Fareed absolutely could have called us over and said, hey, guys, here's some moves I got to make.  And then let him explain his point.  But he never did that.  I punch up a Google alert and find out we're off in bum crap Michigan. 
[00:52:30]  Good!  Deal with your stupid frigging...  Goddamn, what's his name?  Cluck?  Gray and Cluck.  Gray and Cluck.  Live with Gray and Cluck.  One is a program director.  I can't even say enough how bad program directors are as morning show hosts.  They stink.  It's half their job.  They're not concentrating on that.  They're thinking of what frigging record company executive they're going to give fellatio to. 
[00:53:00]  They're not thinking about their show.  What record company is going to send them to the Caribbean?  The Caribbean to spin their records.  And a nice package of nose candy.  Of course.  Like the old days.  Give me some coke, I'll spin your records.  Right.  The good old days.  Use them all up being junkies.  Keep playing Coldplay and we'll keep sending those little packages.  Right.  You want 14-year-old girls?  You got them.  Spin my records.  That's right.  What is this, WKRP in Cincinnati? 
[00:53:30]  Worse than that could ever be.  Right.  Oh, the old days with the PDs.  Look, I'll tell you this much.  When you have a program director actually doing one of the shows on that station, you know you're never going to get anything edgy because the program directors are the ones to tell you not to do anything.  You want some coke, free records, and a trip to Thailand to have sex with young boys?  Oh, wait a minute.  Speaking of which, I want to congratulate Gary Glitter for making it out alive.  Hey, he's out.  Gary Glitter is going to be out of prison. 
[00:54:00]  We can get into that story after the break.  All right.  Because we're edgy.  We're gray and cluck.  Gray and cluck.  Pshu, pshu, pshu.  When we're not doing radio, we are barbecuing.  Pshu, pshu, pshu, pshu.  Live with it, Michigan.  He just said F, Michigan.  F the whole state.  F the state for letting gray and cluck come in.  This is your fault.  Hope you enjoy it.  Hope you enjoy the local angle.  Right.  The local angle.  Who cares? 
[00:54:30]  But, I mean, I want to know.  The guy.  Hey, hey, so we went up to Kalamazoo.  Did you?  I mean, it helps.  It helps you understand the local.  Does it, Patrice?  I enjoyed them to be quite honest.  I'll be honest with you.  Shut up.  Occasionally, in your home state, you throw out local references so your friends in high  school can go, I remember him talking about that.  That's the only reason we do it.  So if you bump into him and go, hey, I heard you're talking about our hometown.  Yeah.  It's an ego thing.  That's all it is. 
[00:55:00]  I think you guys should talk about the East Village more.  Yes.  Let's talk about the East Village.  Dude, when you see, you guys never had to do this, but I had to go here and I had to  go there.  When you start a radio show in one of these godforsaken places, they actually hand you  a list of all the local towns.  Towns.  They give you the roads, who the mayor is, and you just sit there.  So on Saturday, I was driving down Lakeshore Boulevard. 
[00:55:30]  Yeah.  On my way to, uh, uh, Lanchester.  No, you said it wrong.  It's Lancaster.  Oh my god, you said it wrong.  It's not local.  Uh, boys, it's pronounced Peabody, not Peabody.  Remember that?  Boys, I'd like you guys to drive the signal.  When we got the job in Worcester.  Worcester.  In Worcester?  When we got a job there at AF, and Brucey Mittman was the boss, the first day we get 
[00:56:00]  in for a meeting with him.  He goes, uh, boys, I'd like you to drive the signal.  I'm like, what?  He wanted us to drive the perimeter of the entire signal of the radio station to get to  know the towns that it hits and everything.  And I'm just sitting there in a car with Opie going, oh my god.  And I'm thinking to myself, because I don't want to stir things up.  I'm digging the job.  It's my first radio job.  I don't want to stir the pot.  You didn't want to think that this sucks.  But I wanted to turn to Opie at one point so badly and go, why are we doing this?  Let's just stop and get a beer. 
[00:56:30]  We did.  I know.  Oh, all right.  Finally.  You scared me.  No, at first I was like, you know, oh, peepity.  We started driving.  I'm like, why are we doing this?  No one's going to know if we did this or not.  Yeah, let's look at a map.  Let's go get a beer.  And then we go on the air, and Ant admits to Boston.  He's like, yeah, I'm a Yankee fan.  And Bruce is like, no, you have to say you're a Red Sox fan, Anthony.  No.  No.  I'm a Yankee fan.  What is it going to do?  And that's the conflict.  They're not going to listen?  And that's what Boston loved about us, was the dumb conflict that we brought to the area. 
[00:57:00]  Like, is someone actually admitting they're a Yankee fan on radio airwaves in Boston?  They just never listen to these douches.  They don't know anything.  And Farid, you're one of them.  You don't know crap.  Boy, how are you CEO?  Eighty-five cents a share!  He always wanted to be Mel Carpins, and I do believe at this point it's safe to say you fell a bit short there, Farid.  Yeah.  You know what they called you back in the old days?  Bean counter. 
[00:57:30]  They said, oh, the bean counter wants to be CEO of a radio.  Yeah, because he was one of the accountants over at CBS, Infinity Broadcasting, for a while.  And then when Mel left, they kind of elevated him to the level of CEO over there, or whatever the hell he was supposed to be.  And they're like, well, you know, he was a bean counter, so he's got, not too many beans left!  I bought 19 beans!  I have one bean left per share.  Hey, beans!  Not even enough to fart. 
[00:58:00]  No, I have one bean.  Out of every share, I had 19 beans, and there were a lot of beans, Naughton.  A lot of beans, Naughton!  You know what their stock is like?  It's like someone gave you 19 M&Ms and said, don't eat any of these, because if you don't eat them, it's going to turn into 30.  You'll have 30 to 50 M&Ms if you don't touch them.  But you can't help yourself.  But I have 22 M&Ms, and I got 19, now I have 22.  Why don't I just take it?  No, no! 
[00:58:30]  No!  Hold on to them, because it's going to go to at least 30, probably 50 M&Ms.  Next thing you know, you can't help yourself, and you ate 18 of them!  And then I looked, and I had a piece of one M&M left.  I had an M.  Why don't you just appreciate your M&M?  No!  That stock certificate, I swear to you.  I don't even know where it is.  I know where mine is.  In the garbage?  I'm coming in here, I'm going to wipe with it. 
[00:59:00]  Nice.  Could you do that tomorrow?  It's worth more as toilet paper.  And by the way, to Fareed and Judy Ellis and Kevin LeGradd and Citadel, we don't need you.  We're filthy rich.  So, you know.  Well.  Enjoy paying us until at least January for doing nothing!  A little dusty, maybe.  Not quite filthy.  I just put in a huge pool.  It cost a lot of money.  I have a mortgage to pay.  See, this is what the show has to do after we leave.  By the way, I've paid attention to every show that has replaced us. 
[00:59:30]  Every show, because I'm obsessive that way.  Of course.  I'm insane.  There's not one success story.  Not one success story of a show replacing us and turning that station around, okay?  Actually, Hootie and McGillicuddy.  Oh, they might have done a little.  Yeah.  This is what Gray and Cluck are saying about us this morning, Ant.  We're going to, if nothing else, if we can't do anything else with this show, we will shoot  you straight and be honest with you.  And if you're an O&A fan, apparently no one from the ratings ever found you. 
[01:00:00]  Because if you want to mention to any of the other morning shows in town, you ever want  to crack them up, you don't have to try to tell them a joke or a witty story.  Just go, Opie and Anthony, and they'll laugh themselves off their bar stool.  Really, Gray and Cluck?  Off their bar stool?  Get Gray and Cluck on the phone.  Let's see if they want to discuss this.  See how honest, stupid Gray and Cluck want to be.  Let's discuss the Opie and Anthony radio career with the Gray and Cluck radio career. 
[01:00:30]  We're a joke now in this business?  Really?  Gray and Cluck.  That happened?  How about we give it about, you know what?  We'll give it six months, and then we'll go back and we'll revisit the Gray and Cluck show.  Gray and Cluck.  We'll see how you're tearing it up.  We guarantee there's going to be no ratings for Gray and Cluck.  We'll see how you're tearing up the ratings.  Eugh.  We keep it local.  Kalamazoo!  We're fired up this morning. 
[01:01:00]  Opie and Anthony, we don't use lasers to promote our radio show.  Lasers.  877-212-ON-A.  So, we were taking off just about every Citadel station, and I'm sure the last two or three  will be taking off now that we're bitching more.  Yeah.  Because that's what's weird about radio.  These guys can't take it when you complain and bitch. 
[01:01:30]  Sometimes you just got to get it out of your system, so go F yourself.  And we've been told it's a cost-cutting move, because the company's in serious trouble, right?  So, I was aware of this, actually, but it was just handed to me.  On June 4th, 2008, this is public record, so I could read this.  Fareed, who's the CEO of Citadel Broadcasting, decided to take advantage of the fact that 
[01:02:00]  his own stock is really low, and he decided to buy 4 million shares.  Oh, at what?  $1.72.  Ouch!  4 million shares at $1.72 a share.  Yeah.  And what are we looking at from Friday?  What was the 84 cents?  So, here's...  Oh, Fareed lost a couple of bucks. 
[01:02:30]  So, he buys 4 million shares at $1.72.  Get rid of L.O.P. and Anthony!  He decides to take advantage of the fact that his company sucks and goes, you know what?  I can make a quick buck.  Yeah.  First of all, if you can buy 4 million shares of a stock, then you shouldn't be getting  rid of us, because it's a cost-cutting move.  You're doing just fine.  He thought it might instill some confidence.  Well, according to some quick math, Fareed, on that acquisition, lost $3.5 million. 
[01:03:00]  Oops!  That has to suck.  Hello?  Hello?  Yeah, see?  See, that's what Brave Radio guys do.  That was Gray and Cluck.  As soon as they realized it was us, of course they're going to hang up.  Yeah.  Yeah, make all your jokes when we're not on the phone with you.  More effing phonies in this business.  We take it right to you. 
[01:03:30]  There you go.  There's the Brave, Gray, and Cluck.  There you go.  There you go.  All right, want to move on to the bus decapitation story there?  Yeah, let's get the funny back on the show.  Yeah, let's get the funny back on.  This story hit last week.  We had a lot of fun with it.  You heard, right, Patrice?  Oh, it's crazy.  A passenger decapitates man on a Greyhound bus, and they really don't know why he did this. 
[01:04:00]  Crazy?  Yeah, it has to be just crazy at this point, right?  Canadian?  And the description of the beheading was unbelievable.  You want to revisit the audio before we play the new audio?  Please.  In case people didn't hear it last week, it's worth hearing again the description of what was going on on this horror ride.  I don't understand how it's not the biggest story on the planet right now.  It is to the people on that bus.  Yes, that's something they will never forget, ever.  Look, there's a clip. 
[01:04:30]  I don't know if you got it.  There's a clip of one of the people explaining.  Yeah, that is the best clip.  But there's one guy who is just so small you can miss it.  He goes, yeah, you know, I was just sitting there going, God, man, I'm watching him hold his head against the wall.  I just had a cigarette with this guy, and he goes, you know, the head.  Uh-huh, you know, I just had a cigarette with this guy, you know, the head.  You know, because he didn't want the people confused.  He had a cigarette with the killer.  He had a cigarette with the killer.  You know, the head.  I'm like, what? 
[01:05:00]  He had a smoke with the head.  Wow.  Just to reiterate.  Ooh.  Because he's standing there like a monster.  Sure.  Here's the story.  Witnesses say a man traveling aboard this Greyhound bus repeatedly stabbed and then decapitated his seatmate,  then paused to display the head to passengers who had rushed from the bus in horror.  Just took a knife out and stabbed him.  Started stabbing like crazy.  Neither the victim nor the attacker have been identified, and the motive is unclear,  but authorities have taken the 40-year-old suspect into custody. 
[01:05:30]  They say they arrested him after he tried to break a window on the bus and escape.  It was a blood-curdling scream.  I was just reading my book, and all of a sudden I heard it.  He also said passengers who fled the bus secured the door,  and the driver disabled the vehicle, preventing the attacker from getting away.  They were very brave.  They interacted swiftly, calmly in exiting the bus, and as a result, nobody else was injured.  The witness says as soon as the passengers were outside the bus,  that's when the attacker showed off the victim's head and also began methodically carving up the body. 
[01:06:00]  A spokeswoman for Greyhound says there were 37 people aboard the bus and one driver.  Probably didn't have to replay that clip, but that's a good setup for the people that didn't hear.  It's the eyewitness stuff that's amazing.  Yeah.  He got on the bus.  He looked totally calm, totally normal.  We stopped for a cigarette break.  He got off the bus.  When he got back on the bus, he got his stuff, and he came to the back, right to the back of the bus, 
[01:06:30]  and sat right behind me next to the victim.  The bus continued on, I'd say, for, I don't know, another 20 minutes,  and all of a sudden we all heard this scream, like a blood-curdling scream.  I turned around and I saw the guy, he was, the attacker was standing up right over top of the guy with a large hunting knife,  like a survival Rambo knife, holding the guy and continually stabbing him, stabbing him, stabbing him in the chest area.  He must have stabbed him 50 times or 60 times, something like that. 
[01:07:00]  Oh, my God.  With a big Rambo knife.  I ran to the front of the bus and told the bus driver to stop.  Someone was getting stabbed and screamed, everybody get off the bus, off the bus.  We all eventually got out.  The whole time the attacker was just calmly over top of the victim.  He's continually cutting him.  I think the victim was gone at that point.  Went back into the bus to see if maybe the guy was still alive or what. 
[01:07:30]  When we came back on the bus, he, it was visible at the end of the bus,  he was cutting the guy's head off and pretty much gutting him up.  Wow.  My girl goes, why didn't anybody try to help?  Really?  Yeah.  You're going to jump in there with the guy with the Rambo knife.  Stabbing him like Jason.  All of us.  Hey, Gray.  Yo.  Why are you guys trashing us on your first day?  You think that's, like, going to get the job done or what?  It's our third week.  Is it really?  No one's paying attention. 
[01:08:00]  This is the start of our third week.  And you're talking about barbecuing and losing your keys,  and that's supposed to be the edgiest show on radio?  Oh, man, I'll be completely honest.  I was the PD when we signed you guys on.  Yeah, I understand that.  And that's why you're doing the morning show now,  because they're looking for something cheap.  You know that, so why don't you tell your audience?  Opie, they flew me to Buffalo to find ways to promote the show.  We didn't do anything with O&A on the cheap.  In fact, it killed the radio station. 
[01:08:30]  No, no, no.  The listeners have said that they didn't see any promotion in Grand Rapids, Michigan,  whatsoever.  And don't bring up Buffalo.  We were doing very well in Buffalo.  I know, that's why I'm friends with those guys.  I was out there with Evil Jim for two days trying to pick up anything and everything  that I could to help promote that show.  Well, bro, stop being phony and making O&A jokes, because you believed in the show.  So just stop.  Dude, the only thing that we ever said on this show was that the ratings made...  Hold on.  We just played a clip.  We had to make a change because of the ratings. 
[01:09:00]  And that's the truth.  You know how the game works, man.  You're not new to this.  So you guys think you're going to get the ratings up now?  Dude, just the fact that we're local to Grand Rapids will result in more ratings.  Local.  And so we're off in Buffalo also because of the ratings?  We were doing very well there.  We're off in every Citadel station because of the ratings.  I had no idea that you guys were off in Buffalo.  Yeah, because Fareed, in his wisdom, with his $0.85 stock that we got in at $19 a share, 
[01:09:30]  is cutting corners by getting rid of expensive programming, what he deems expensive,  and putting in cheap programming.  Look, he's got you doing double duty.  Well, dude, no.  There's a couple of things there.  One, he hired in a whole staff when you guys went away.  We're not saving any money.  We had to hire...  Believe me, he's saving money.  And believe me, no offense to you.  I mean, we listened to some of the stuff you're doing today.  That's not going to get the job done.  It's going to be a nice local show.  It'll be a safe show. 
[01:10:00]  But you're the program director, right?  Yeah.  How is that going to work when the program director is supposed to march into radio studios  and go, look, guys, you can't do that.  It's too edgy.  So of course you're not going to do anything edgy or interesting because your job's on the line.  It's stupid.  And you did take a shot at us.  We just played this clip a mere 10 minutes ago.  If nothing else, if we can't do anything else with this show, we will shoot you straight  and be honest with you.  And if you're an ONA fan, apparently no one from the ratings ever found you. 
[01:10:30]  Because if you want to make the other morning shows in town, you ever want to crack them  up?  You don't have to try to tell them a joke or a witty story.  Just go, Opie and Anthony.  And they'll laugh themselves off their bar stool.  Yeah, they're going to laugh themselves off their bar stools, really?  Do you know what we've done with our careers, jackass?  Yeah, I do.  So do your effing show.  You moved on from Opie and Anthony and just move on.  You were a fan of the show.  And now, because we're not around, you're going to trash us?  Not at all.  Do you have any idea? 
[01:11:00]  When were you on Leno?  When were you on Letterman?  When did you guys do a comedy show in front of 10,000 people?  Why don't you answer some of those questions?  Are you a syndicated show across America on satellite radio?  Hey, Opie, when did you get your start in mornings?  Four years ago?  Five years ago?  When did you get your start with Anthony on the radio?  When was your first day on the air?  What is this, 10 questions?  What does that have to do with anything?  Just don't trash us.  You guys decided to go in another direction.  So do that. 
[01:11:30]  You know damn well you guys were fans of the effing show.  All right, so it didn't work out.  Don't take your stupid shots.  I told you.  Our careers are what they are.  We've done very well for ourselves, and you know that.  And it didn't work here.  Do you have any ideas, the PD?  And who's the dope laughing in the background?  What have you done with your stupid career, dope?  Do you have any idea how annoying it is over the last two years to have this station beaten  in morning drive by the Free Beer and Hot Wings show?  Well, I guess they like them a little better.  What can I tell you?  At least I've heard of them. 
[01:12:00]  So you're going to now beat Free Beer and Hot Wings?  Not off the bat.  We're starting to...  There's no offense, but you're not.  Because you're the PD.  You can't do it.  You can't do both jobs because you're supposed to be the guy who goes, look, guys, you can't  do that on the radio.  So how's that going to work?  That doesn't contain anything.  You're a suit.  You really are a suit.  And then they did this because, you know, this is what you do after Opie and Anthony leave  your town.  If you're calling from New York City and you're rolling tape on this there in the O&A office,  there's a reason you guys weren't on the radio anymore. 
[01:12:30]  This is it.  Can you tell me what that means?  I don't even know what you did.  What kind of shot was that?  I was waiting on hold and we were playing a simulcast of your stock option talk.  I wish to God you guys would have paid half this much attention to this market when you  were actually...  This market when we were blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Look, it didn't work, whatever.  But don't take shots at us now.  You know damn well we're successful in this business. 
[01:13:00]  We're successful in New York.  Here it was...  No, we're successful in a lot of cities on regular radio.  And as far as satellite radio goes, we're pretty much the biggest thing on XM.  Have fun dealing with Fareed, too.  Yeah, Fareed's going to screw you in the end, too.  So, you know, keep doing the corporate thing, bro.  Corporate thing.  But go do your stupid show and leave us out of it.  You pussies.  Okay.  All right, man.  Shut up, dude.  You didn't even say anything except do a little pot laugh.  That's great. 
[01:13:30]  That was magnificent, dude.  I must say.  I really have to say that, dude.  Oh, that was beautiful, man.  A lot of respect for that.  I suck.  I'm telling you, if this was where I grew up, what Opie just did was that guy has to give  him his lunch money for the rest of his life unless he changes schools.  And I'm not lying to you, man.  Yeah.  I'm not lying.  He had to pretend to get tough at the end, kind of.  It just, that was beautiful. 
[01:14:00]  That was like.  I have to say that was beautiful.  You know what that was, too?  That wasn't talking to a morning radio guy.  That was talking to a program director.  That sounded like talking to a PD.  Ugh.  Good luck to you guys.  Good luck.  You're really going to need it.  If they play that wide air show that was on air, they're in deep trouble with their listeners.  That just was.  See, that.  That was just sad.  But that's the problem.  I mean, these guys are all brave, you know, because you're not around.  And then you call them out on it.  Oh.  And you didn't back down. 
[01:14:30]  That was beautiful because he was looking for an out.  He was looking for a nice fat out.  Yeah.  And Opie was like, you're just a jerk.  And you're lying.  And the guy's just like, but, but, but.  And he wouldn't even give him an out.  That was marvelous.  Program director talk.  God bless the optimism.  But, you know, what we heard, they're not going to get the job done.  Going local and making sure they mention three or four local things every break.  Who gives a crap?  And nobody in my life has yet to explain radio ratings to me.  Yet.  Yet. 
[01:15:00]  It's arbitrary.  It's ridiculous.  It just, it just made up.  Look, you know, if it, if it didn't work in Grand Rapids, it didn't work.  You know, whatever.  But, you know, then turn around and like trash us when you were the guy that, quote, believed in the show.  And, and you're definitely a fan of the show.  You know, didn't they say in one of their breaks, we keep it honest here.  Why don't you say, look, I, we love these guys.  It didn't work in our market.  We're sorry to see them go, but we're going to try something new.  But instead it was like, well, they're the laughing stock of all morning radio here in Grand Rapids. 
[01:15:30]  People are falling off their bar stools.  All you have to do is mention their name.  Oh, he was just.  Shut the F up.  At least they know our name.  That was, that was painful to listen to, man.  God damn if that was the street.  Ooh.  Well, we got the latest audio on the beheading.  So we take a quick break.  I just heard a good beheading.  Fired up today.  Absolutely.  Opie and Anthony on your radio. 
[01:16:00]  Let's say hi to Greg in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  Greg, what's going on?  Hey, I just heard your cut about.  Stray and Cluck.  I heard those idiots talking about you guys the first they went live.  Their shows suck, man.  I don't even care if they suck.  I don't care if they're good.  But, you know, if you're going to say you're an edgy show and you're an honest show, then why don't you just tell the truth?  That you like the show.  You wanted to work at Grand Rapids.  It didn't work.  It's unfortunate for everybody.  But we're going to move in another direction.  Instead of taking all sorts of shots at us when we're long gone. 
[01:16:30]  I mean, I hope people in Michigan understand how embarrassing that was.  That's your morning show, guy.  I mean, and I stay out of these radio things.  I'm just a guest because I might be in Grand Rapids and need to do Cluck and Gray.  But to watch that phoniness, because I heard the clips.  If this was in the hood, this is what happened to that guy.  He has to give his lunch money to Opie every day now for the rest of his life. 
[01:17:00]  Nice.  Unless he's transferred from this school.  He has to pick what they say a new route.  If he walked home on the main route, he has to go 10 miles out of his way to get to school now.  Because Opie just took him in the bathroom.  I'm telling you.  Took him in the bathroom.  Smacked him in his face when nobody was looking.  Because he wasn't playing games.  Gray, this is what he did.  He said, almost like if a magician gave away the tricks.  He goes, dude, you know it's radio. 
[01:17:30]  You know what I'm doing.  Of course he does.  Of course he knows what he's doing.  See how much bravery I have now because of Gray's nonsense?  I'm a bully.  I was shutting my big mouth until I heard this guy let everybody out.  Why shouldn't I get some lunch money now?  There's no fear to this guy.  If he called me and go, what's with this guy?  I'll go, shh.  You shush him now.  He should be effectively finished right now.  Yeah, that should have done it. 
[01:18:00]  No credibility.  That has no credibility now.  You know what he was talking like also a program director?  He wasn't talking like a morning show host talking to another morning show host.  Why would he do that?  He's talking like a program director talking to air talent.  That was his take on the whole thing.  And they did the same thing in Buffalo.  I think we've educated a lot of people about radio in general.  Program directors, we don't acknowledge.  They all suck.  Program directors are guys that failed at doing radio shows. 
[01:18:30]  They wanted to be on the air.  At some point, every PD was on the air.  They had their show, it failed miserably, and they ended up being a program director.  Talking to air personalities and vicariously living through them.  There's not one program director we listen to or acknowledge or respect in this business  to the point they don't even give us a program director anymore.  They finally got it.  They're like, these guys don't acknowledge program directors.  We loved you. 
[01:19:00]  Yeah, they all sucked.  We went to Buffalo to try to figure out, did you?  Did you really?  Did you have a nice time?  You know how many of the program directors we slapped about the face over the years?  And they're like, I thought I told you not to do that.  And then you went down the hall and you did that.  Yeah, we did.  What are you going to do about it?  I don't know.  I'll have to talk to the GM and see what we're going to do now.  Because now you're not going to listen to me.  And I don't know what to do.  Because when I was in Des Moines, Iowa, the local morning show, they listened to every word I said. 
[01:19:30]  But these O.B. and Anthony characters, they don't listen.  What am I going to do now?  In the book of arguing that was written in the year one, page one was, you don't start asking me a line of cross-examinations so I can lead to my own demise in these arguments.  So how long have you been doing it?  Uh, 20 years.  Continue.  So what's your mom's name? 
[01:20:00]  Uh, that wasn't good.  What are you, stupid?  Shut up!  You're not going to talk your way out of this beating.  The guy thought, I've never been in an argument or something before?  Are you kidding me?  We've taken on every single effing radio guy out there.  Every single one of them.  Then when he started seeing the emails from fans going, dude, you're not clucking and you're not graying.  Dude, we're behind you.  And he tried to go, well, what about the beer?  It was too late.  It's called the punk test, my friend.  You failed that.  Punk test is I do two things to you that I find out that you are a punk before I actually make my move on you. 
[01:20:30]  Right.  I bump into you and then I knock your milk in your lap.  And then by the time I go, give me your money and you go, I don't want to.  I go, shut your face because I already pushed you and knocked your milk in your lap.  Now do you want me to punch in your eye?  Give me your money.  And he said, all right, you got me.  He gave up the money.  And he tried to defend himself in front of his friends because you knew somebody broke it.  Why would he play that beating on the air? 
[01:21:00]  There's a reason.  Why would he do that?  Wait, Joe.  Joe, Michigan.  Joe.  Yeah.  Hey, fellas, they played that entire interview on the air.  It was fantastic.  They were in way over their heads.  Topes.  Fantastic.  Good luck.  They never pushed your show.  I pushed it more than they did.  Look, I'm not going to.  I've been listening to you guys for years on XM.  It's been fabulous.  Look, but I'm not going to sit here and go, it's their fault.  It just didn't work in Grand Rapids.  Whatever. 
[01:21:30]  You know, but move on and do the right thing.  And don't trash us after we're off the air.  That's a pussy way out, man.  And there's a reason why these guys are stuck in one market for their entire careers.  Because they listen to the corporate douches.  They listen to program directors.  One of them is a program director.  And they all sit there and they're jealous because they see like, you know, shows like  ours getting very, very successful.  The formula is really easy.  You go on the air and you don't listen to any of these corporate assholes.  That was, that was embarrassing. 
[01:22:00]  I'm almost mad at him because I just, it would have been better for him to go F you, Opie,  and then call you or email you or something that he, that, wait, do something that you  couldn't, he couldn't, you couldn't prove that he actually said sorry.  Just something.  Send a pigeon with a note.  A self-destructive message to say, hey, look, you know what this is, man.  Nothing personal.  But on the air, you were supposed to go, what?  Yeah.  We're the new, we're the new kid in town.  And then, like, fake it. 
[01:22:30]  He couldn't even fake it.  No.  And none of these guys are successful after we leave these markets.  We were off the air for three weeks over there?  I guess.  How come I just saw it yesterday?  Because, you know, because Farid left us out of the loop.  We assumed we were still broadcasting to Grand Rapids.  That Farid.  This is what this effing business has become.  That Farid is a worm.  He's a worm.  He told the whole company.  Have we really been off three weeks?  Apparently, these guys were on three weeks.  I mean, Anthony plays it different than me. 
[01:23:00]  I actually pay attention to this stuff.  And I'm not, I'm not taking a shot at Anthony tonight.  I thought we were still on.  And if I thought we were still on, wow, were they pulling the wool over our eyes?  Yeah, I thought, I read a news article yesterday, how these guys were, you know, going to be swooping in and being local.  Right.  So I'm like, oh, we're off in that market?  We've been off for three weeks over there?  Yeah.  Joe Pesci from Goodfellas.  And then Pothead Dude was the smartest, Pothead Dude was the smartest guy during that whole phone call, just laughing. 
[01:23:30]  Because he knew he was in over his head.  I bet you, well, Sam said as soon as we hung up, then they go off on their, oh, they're off, oh, that's the brave way to do it.  Too late, it's too late, man.  Go, screw yourselves.  Oh, there's no redemption to that one.  Mew, Fareed.  No redemption.  Let's get back to the guy that was decapitated on that Greyhound bus.  We're setting up the new audio, so here's the final clip.  Fareed?  Huh?  Was his name Fareed?  Wow.  Here's the, oh, wait, what is this? 
[01:24:00]  Where am I?  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.  Oh, because Traveling Pants 1 was so good.  Dude, we did the bit.  It was, we killed that stupid.  Oh, God.  We killed that stupid bit.  Would you ever be caught dead?  Would you ever be caught watching that drivel?  The first.  Mystic Pizza 3.  Yeah.  Dude, the return of what?  Patrice, the first one didn't even do well.  And they decided to make a second one.  The Bridges of Madison County 2. 
[01:24:30]  Where Fat Broad is going to squeeze into the same pants as Skinny Broad.  See, they're like magic pants.  What?  They fit all the broads.  The fat ass one.  The little skinny ass one.  The only reason I knew that movie existed is because of that ridiculous title.  They just had to do another movie so they could say it again.  Traveling Pants.  The sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.  Doesn't Traveling Pants mean like a wedgie?  Like, oh, they're traveling on me.  The first movie made $8.600 at the box office. 
[01:25:00]  What?  Yeah.  They had to make another.  I just watched it.  I thought it was a Club Med commercial because they just show these girls jumping in the water.  Of course.  And it's sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.  2.  Are you serious?  I'm so sorry, dude.  I couldn't even.  Now go with it, man.  We killed this movie.  What?  Oh, yeah.  Didn't you see how the first one ended?  It left an open end for a sequel.  Really?  Did?  Yeah.  Did she pull out a card and say there's an evil guy? 
[01:25:30]  There's an evil woman killing everybody?  No, actually, Doc.  She calls herself Catwoman?  Doc Brown came back down and said, it's your kids.  It's your kids.  And then they all got in the DeLorean and took off.  And, you know, where they were going, they didn't need roads.  So that's how it ended.  And it said to be continued.  Are you serious?  Yes.  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants ended that way.  So now it's Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.  And then Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 3 will take place in the Old West. 
[01:26:00]  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 4 being 3D.  The 3D.  As a fat woman rolls her own burrito and moves it towards the camera and back.  I can't believe it.  I'm so sorry, dude.  I cannot believe I just saw that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Horrid.  I thought it was a cruise ship commercial.  I was just looking at it. 
[01:26:30]  It's two girls jumping in the water.  Yay.  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2.  Do you know what that awful movie is about?  I don't know.  There's these little broads go on vacation and stuff and wear these pants.  And then when they have adventures and then they send the pants to another girl.  And when she puts the pants on, then they show her boring ass story.  And then she's...  Is it the same concept of the Dollar Bill movie that, you know... 
[01:27:00]  Well, maybe whoever has the dollar.  And now it's just with pants.  Whoever's got the pants on.  Some dirty ass pants, too.  Filthy ass pants.  They didn't have enough pants adventures in one?  No.  And for some reason, it still fits.  You know what?  We're going to cut out one of these traveling pants adventures.  No, they have plenty.  You want the synopsis of two or what?  Please.  What's the synopsis of one?  Three years after the events of the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, the four young women  are back.  Despite the distance that divides them as they depart for college,  the friends from Anne Blah Blah Teen's book series still stay connected. 
[01:27:30]  This sequel returns Amber and blah and blah.  Is Ugly Betty in it again?  Yeah, Ugly Betty's in there.  It's Amber Tamblyn.  That's why.  There you go.  Okay, all right.  I'm sorry.  Ugly Betty's in it.  Those traveling pants should just be...  If they're off to college, it should be in some dorm room, laying on the floor,  ready to just get full of stuff that wasn't completely cleaned up.  Here, now you take them.  What's this in it?  Yeah, put them through the wash. 
[01:28:00]  Yeah.  They should call it Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, not at Ugly Betty's Famous.  We're trying it again.  And they're magic.  They are kind of magic pants because they fit Amber Tamblyn's ass and Ugly Betty's ass,  which would never happen.  That's like me fitting into Patrice's pants.  Yeah, and all of a sudden they fade.  Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants started over in Patrice.  Brotherhood of the Traveling Pants.  Hey, Ope, let me grab your pants.  All right.  Is it your turn to wear the pants?  Well, I want to have an adventure. 
[01:28:30]  I cannot believe this.  I can't get in a movie to save my life.  You're the Brotherhood of Ope's smelly sweatpants.  Everyone's got to wear his gym pants.  Me and Steve...  We should do a parody for YouTube.  I think it would do very well.  Us three just sharing pants.  Sharing our pants.  How about we...  Patrice, could you bring in a pair of your jeans and we'll...  Not a problem.  We'll do a whole freaking thing for YouTube.  Not a problem.  Brotherhood of the Traveling Patrice Pants. 
[01:29:00]  It's going to happen.  It's got to happen.  Here's the dumb trailer.  Don't you know that all the bitches in Greece are nude?  Lena's shy.  Lena's shy.  Oh, you got one shy.  All right, here we go.  A shy one?  Yep.  A ho-a.  Right.  One that's...  Very, very studious.  An intellectual, sure.  And the other one's kind of just...  Athletic.  A rebel.  No?  No, no, a rebel, yeah.  I'm going rebel.  A tattoo on a finger.  Well, rebel, ho.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:29:30]  You need athletic, intellectual, shy, ho.  That's the formula.  This is basically sex in the city for 20-something.  Hey.  Lena's shy.  Saturday night.  Maybe.  I can't.  Bridget's bold.  Woo!  Tibby's bored.  And Carmen speaks her mind.  You think that a pair of jeans that's been all three of you is going to fit all of this?  Four friends.  Her big ass.  One sisterhood.  God!  I'm so sorry.  The sisterhood of the traveling pants with a PG starts Wednesday, June 1st. 
[01:30:00]  Boring.  Oh, that was the first one.  Of course.  Oh, that was the one for the first?  Yeah.  But it could be for the second one.  It's the same guy.  It's the same story.  Oh, no.  That's pants, too.  What?  I guess.  Because the trailer for two should just be, remember the first one?  There you go.  Same crap.  Only their asses are a little bigger.  And Betty's famous.  Ugly Betty's famous now. 
[01:30:30]  She was contractually obligated to do another one.  They should do Young Guns 3.  Oh, now you're talking.  Now that Kiefer is the dude from 24.  And he's gone to jail.  And he gets deweys and he's insane.  And the trailer just has Lou Diamond Phillips going, thank God.  Thank you.  You got me off the sci-fi channel doing these movies with friggin' college CGI.  Oh, you see some of the sci-fi science fictions he's in? 
[01:31:00]  Oh, Super Croc 2.  He had the best bad movies ever.  They stink, those sci-fi original movies.  And they all have him in it.  Bumblebee Man.  Yeah.  Lou Diamond Phillips must save the world.  Starring the good-looking guy from Star Troopers that they thought was going to be famous.  But it didn't work out.  What is it?  Casper Vane Deem.  Whoa.  You're good.  He's in everything.  He's in movies that say 2008.  Sci-fi original. 
[01:31:30]  Spider-Rack 3.  Starring Lou Diamond Phillips from La Bamba.  He's got to still say, and from La Bamba, Lou Diamond Phillips.  Because they couldn't get Benjamin Bratt.  Yeah.  Benjamin Bratt.  Lou Diamond Phillips who lost his wife to lesbianism.  Turned his wife gay.  Right.  And now he's battling giant ants in his sci-fi original.  Lou Diamond Phillips has finally come out of hiding. 
[01:32:00]  After Fire Ant Boulevard.  And now he's the sheriff.  He's always the sheriff of us.  Oh, he's always, yeah.  He plays a small town sheriff.  They just give him the same wardrobe every movie.  Sci-fi is just like, yeah, Lou, you know where your costume is.  Did you bring it?  They told him to take it home and watch it.  It's either they're going to give him the guitar or the sheriff badge to put on his pajamas from the last movie he had. 
[01:32:30]  It's just so poor Lou.  Lou Diamond Phillips must save the world from this onslaught of bad CGI.  His first film in 10 years.  He had to hide after he found out his wife turned gay.  Turned lesbo on him.  He figured it's about time he comes out of hiding to make this crap.  Coincidentally enough, this movie is about killer clams.  Coincidentally enough.  That's the dude.  That's the trailer. 
[01:33:00]  Coincidentally.  Coincidentally.  Oh, my God.  All right, listen.  Why don't we get the decapitation stuff out of the way?  Because we got Larry King drunk.  If we don't do Larry King drunk today, then we're not doing our drunk.  Drunk Larry King?  Oh, yeah.  Larry King drunk tapes.  How important is the booze?  We'll get into that.  Hold on.  Let's get this out of the way.  I like my garlic with brandy.  My garlic.  Garlic.  You ever mix vodka with Welch's grape juice? 
[01:33:30]  Chill.  Wait till you hear the tapes.  They're very good.  All right.  Okay, the eyewitness from the beheading on the Greyhound bus, and then we got finally  the audio that came out this morning.  The trucker that pulled up had all these, you know, he had a crowbar and a hammer and  all these kind of things.  So the three of us were sitting there guarding the door.  You know, he's fidgeting with the buttons trying to get out, and he's trying to get to drive  the bus and stuff.  So the bus driver disables the bus somehow. 
[01:34:00]  And while we're watching the door, he calmly walks up to the front with the head in his  hand and the knife, and just calmly stares at us and drops the head right in front of  us.  Holy crap.  How bloody must that guy have been, too?  First, he stabs him in the chest as he's hovering over him 50 times, and then chops  his head off, and then goes over and pushes buttons.  He must have just been covered in blood.  Well, it's funny you should mention that, because that's what the new audio is all about.  What the hell?  Listen to this. 
[01:34:30]  I'm dying here, Larry.  Listen to this.  This is what we're finding out.  Ready?  Where was that from?  Reservoir Talks.  That's right.  I'm dying.  He was bleeding real bad.  Badger appears to be a six-foot-tall Asian male, short, dark hair, black t-shirt, arm  with a knife right now.  These are the police tapes, as it was going down.  Listen to this.  Hey, you want us to send a Mountie or something?  Badger appears to be a six-foot-tall Asian male, short, dark hair, black t-shirt, arm  with a knife right now. 
[01:35:00]  Sorry.  It appears he has two knives now.  Court has just confirmed that westbound traffic is now detoured.  Double wielding.  Badger is armed with a knife and a pair of scissors.  And he's defiling the body at the front of the bus as we speak.  He's still inside the bus?  Yeah, he's right up front, right by the door.  Copy that.  Door open or closed?  Door's closed and locked with a PC.  Copy that.  Oh, my God.  Cigars and scotch.  Sisterhood of the traveling head. 
[01:35:30]  Put it on the bus.  Please tell me why 911 calls don't go like this.  There's a man with two knives stabbing someone.  Everyone's on the way now.  Everyone.  Right now.  You're so right.  The first thing should be...  Why do you need more info?  Then this guy goes, door open or closed.  Well, you figure it out because I'm not screaming running through the desert telling you that  this man is chasing me with his knife.  It should be exactly, where are you?  Okay.  Everyone's coming. 
[01:36:00]  Ready?  Here's where.  If I'm the 911 guy.  Six-foot Asian.  Whoa.  Someone's coming right now.  We're sending helicopters.  Don't you worry.  Now, the fact that you're calling me and saying six-foot Asian, I know there's no game.  They're on the way now.  Now, what's going on?  And then the rest of my call will be me going, what?  Where y'all at?  Who's down there?  This is squad car, 183.  Where y'all at? 
[01:36:30]  It's a giant Asian cutting off somebody's head.  Is the door open?  I think they do that just to have a 911 take the play.  So they're doing their procedure.  These robots.  Door open or closed?  Door open or closed.  What's the air pressure in the tires on the bus?  Could you check the air pressure?  Well, listen to this.  You're going to be amazed.  The last clip we got.  Oh, my God.  Listen to this clip.  We're just going around the light path now.  Zulu from L-8.  He's at the rear of the bus.  Packing up the bike.  Zulu Delta 1. 
[01:37:00]  Delta 1 Zulu.  Delta 1 Zulu.  Okay.  Badger's at the back of the bus.  Packing off pieces and eating it.  Hopefully, he was eating the guy.  He was cutting off pieces of the guy's meat and eating it.  Wait a minute.  What's this from?  Hey, listen.  This is a giant agent killing somebody.  Send everyone.  Everyone?  Everyone.  The professional.  Oh, is that great? 
[01:37:30]  Send everybody.  Are you joking me?  This is what?  What?  Why is this some kind of hidden news?  This should be the news.  I'm on the Greyhound bus.  Now, the world right now, we're talking about America.  I'm falling apart money-wise.  Everyone's going to be riding the bus now.  I'm going to ride the bus.  Everybody's riding the bus.  Now, this man decides to get on the bus and cut off and eat somebody's face. 
[01:38:00]  Can I please just know that?  Can I know that?  I barely knew that.  My girl was telling me about it.  I ignored her.  I had to get it the third person.  When my girl tells me news, I just go, uh-huh.  And then somebody else told me, did you hear about the beheading?  I'm like, what?  What?  Islamic?  What?  No, no.  Big Asian on a bus.  A big Asian.  A giant six-foot Asian who's stabbing you to death.  That's something to wake up to on a bus. 
[01:38:30]  Like, you wake up long enough to look at that and die.  There should be times that the criminal process, this is the criminal process, it's crazy.  Sometimes innocent people go to jail, and then a guy like this, who did it?  You know.  And you're not allowed to just hit him with a cattle prod.  He's not allowed to go, hey, listen, he went to court and they said nothing.  He shook his head, so you're not going to say nothing?  Uh-uh.  No.  They should be able to do something to him to go, no, we need to know why you did that. 
[01:39:00]  We know you did it.  We saw you.  A lot of people saw you.  It's not the wrong guy.  Why'd you do it?  There's no process you get off of this one.  I mean, I believe in the process, because I, you know.  Yeah, but in this case.  Oh.  Dude.  That's why I'm like, I've always said, there are some cases that are just, it shouldn't  be run through the system.  This guy did it.  Just, just kill him.  He's not going to be a productive member of society. 
[01:39:30]  A jury of his peers?  Giant Asians who understand his plight?  All right, listen, we've got to take a break.  We've been playing catch up all day.  This is a weird show today, but a fun one at that.  Patrice O'Neill in today.  We'll continue with the, what, drunk tapes from Larry King.  Please.  We'll do that next.  O.P. and Anthony, stay there. 
[01:40:00]  What's up, people?  It's O&A.  Patrice O'Neill doing a great job with us today.  So, uh, you've got Larry King doing his radio show.  And he sounds a bit drunk.  Sounds like he's on something.  What do we know about this stunt brain?  He used to do an overnight show on the Mutual Radio Network, Don, from like 1 till 5 a.m.  Yeah.  And he would take a lot of phone calls.  And there were rumors that there was a tape out there of him being, uh, on the air, over-served. 
[01:40:30]  Over-served.  And this one, uh, I think is from about 80-something.  Oh, this goes way back?  Yeah, way back.  All right.  Here's Larry King, uh, drunk on his radio show.  Or so we think.  All right.  I'm a student of print journalism.  And I just wanted to know, uh, what advice do you have for, uh, uh, young people coming up into the field?  Like, I, a lot of, uh, professors are telling us how hard it is to get into the field at first.  They're just like, no, since you're in the field, do you have any advice on that? 
[01:41:00]  Like, for instance, experience, is that important?  Uh-huh.  Sure.  Is that probably the most important, uh, outcome?  Well, it's way up there.  It's way up there.  Anything, anything else?  Anything that you need to do?  Pressure on the fire.  Mm-hmm.  Done this before.  I don't want it to be his first, uh, surgery.  Okay.  Applied himself well.  Mm-hmm.  Here's the things I'd have confidence in a young MD. 
[01:41:30]  Okay.  I'm talking about journalism field.  I'm lost.  What do you mean?  Dude, journalism.  Like, I'm a student of journalism at a college.  Lost, all right.  And I was just wondering the most important aspect of getting into journalism.  Not the medical field.  I think you're exhausted.  I thought he's, uh, only been lost recently. 
[01:42:00]  This is 20 years ago.  He was already lost.  Well, this sounds like he was probably a little tanked, maybe.  Hmm.  Sounds the same to me.  Yeah, he sounds exactly the same as he does now.  All disoriented.  I don't understand.  That's from 20 years ago?  Yeah.  It continues.  I am exhausted from 30 nights. 
[01:42:30]  No, no person, even those of us who are superhuman.  Those of us with, uh, Herculean appetites for the diverse and the bizarre.  Even those of us who, uh, have shown an aptitude to, uh, to, uh, fight the good fight and stay the good long battle.  Even those of us can get tired.  And your boy is tired after 30 consecutive nights.  I have a half hour to go, and I'm going to do that half hour because I'm a pro.  That's what pros do.  I'm a professional.  Look it up in the book.  Okay. 
[01:43:00]  That's what we do.  We're pros.  We're never rude.  We don't comp out.  We don't tell you that we're ill or that we're looking for the farmhouse in the middle of the desert.  Or that we're parched.  We don't tell you that maybe the check didn't come through this month.  And where the hell does it go anyway if you're a guy who's left 16 forwarding addresses.  Okay.  So what do you do?  What is the answer?  Yeah, you're a little perturbed now.  Kind of worried about the club.  Why don't I?  I don't worry about the club.  Worry about maybe Jackie might worry.  Nah, don't worry. 
[01:43:30]  God bless Latter-day.  He was having a meltdown from the mediocrity.  Don't worry.  He was having an artistic moment in his life.  Like he was really having a moment of clarity.  Of how awful he's been and how awful you are.  Holy jeez.  Is this it?  Sounds like Frankie Blue.  We should play the Frankie Blue.  Frankie Blue drunk tapes.  Those are classic.  But all right.  And then Larry finishes up with this guy.  Okay, just cool it. 
[01:44:00]  Life is a breeze.  Of course, some breezes, as you know, are 110 miles an hour and get promoted up to hurricanes.  I just thought I'd pass that along.  Speaking of pass it along, we're going to pass along now to the newsroom.  The mutual newsroom high atop the overlooking downtown, beautiful downtown studios of Walson, Virginia, Washington, D.C.  The mutual newsroom will get us up to date on the news headlines.  And we'll come back with a little more open phone American.  We'll have our salute to my man, Duke Zebert, by taking him to one of his favorite places. 
[01:44:30]  One of mine, too.  The town of Cooperstown, New York.  This is the Larry King Show in Washington.  And we'll be right back.  Wow.  Wow.  Poor guy.  That's how I feel about him.  This poor Larry.  Drunk and tired of it all.  But you know what?  I just found in this business, and again, I like the guy.  It's Alan Combs from Hannity Combs.  Oh, yeah.  And just talking to him.  And this is my opinion of the situation. 
[01:45:00]  It's like this business, when you kind of want to be a crusader, when you have some ideals,  you just meet Sean Hannity, and he clicks his heels as he's destroying a life.  And Alan just, you get like that.  That's right after he would, this is probably when Larry King was a crusader, then he realized,  what am I even fighting for?  And then he became what he is now.  Yeah.  Just a dude that goes, huh? 
[01:45:30]  Huh, what?  That's what happened.  The Motley Crue.  I think Alan had a, he was a crusader.  Alan was a damn, like, idealist.  And then he just goes, wait a minute.  They don't, did Bill O'Reilly just argue with Geraldo, and then afterwards they kissed  each other like they were in an MMA fight?  Like, good one.  Like, he says they don't care.  No.  No.  It's not.  It sounds like a guy who realized no one cares.  He gave up.  Gave up the fight.  On all that. 
[01:46:00]  That's a great observation about Larry King there.  Good fight.  Yeah.  That tape reminds us of the famous Frankie Blue.  We haven't done it in a while.  You want to do the Frankie Blue?  Oh, please.  I want to hear Frankie Blue.  The story goes here in New York.  Frankie Blue is a huge program director in the, what format was that?  Dance.  It was kind of a dance.  He was at Z100 and then KTU, which was pop dance.  Pop dance.  But he was the program director when it came to this format, and they had like a Christmas  party here in New York, and everyone got allegedly tanked, and then the night girl had to go on 
[01:46:30]  the air, and what did he say to her?  He pissed her off that she walked off her show.  Well, he was upset that she didn't come to the Christmas party.  Right.  And so he kind of told her what he thought of her non-attendance, and I think he said  she wasn't, she thought she was too good.  Right.  And it comes up.  And then he, like she marches out of the studio.  He is wasted.  Now he needs to go on the air because he just lost his jock. 
[01:47:00]  Yeah.  And by the end of his air shift, he was fired.  This legendary program director.  Just fired.  Does he still exist?  No.  We haven't heard from him since.  The end of Frankie Blue is what we can read.  Oh yeah, this was it.  Yeah.  This was the Jimmy the Greek tape.  Yeah.  Remember when Jimmy the Greek went off?  Wow.  And you just never saw him again, ever?  And we had some guys, let's just say we had some guys, big fans of the show, and that's  how we got this.  This should have never seen the light of day, these tapes. 
[01:47:30]  No one was recording this at home.  This is an inside job.  It's right off the board.  Yeah.  So here's Frankie Blue.  Listen to this, Patrice.  I love this song.  Nelly featuring Tim McGraw.  This is Frankie Blue.  Now, you know, for the last several weeks, we've been giving you a show.

He's talking about like $50,000, right?  Yeah.  50 grand prize winner.  He made it sound like there's 50 grand prize winners.  Yeah.  He's so hammered.

[01:50:00]  RuPaul's going to dip his big old hands in there.  Pick the winner.  And we're going to find you.  And I don't care if it takes all day.  It's worth the $50,000 in the car.  All right.  We have the armored truck.  We've got the party patrol vans.  We've got the car.  We've got everything.  But more important than that, we've got the best music in town. 
[01:50:30]  So why don't you give me a call?  By the way, that was supposed to take maybe 20 seconds.  Oh, yeah.  That was well over two minutes of him just babbling.  Yeah, that was a quickie.  Yeah.  50 grand prize winner.  50 grand prize winner.  See, the jocks are supposed to act that way.  Not the program directories on the air.  This was after a Christmas party?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, after a Christmas party.  Why would he get fired after this?  Because he got into a little brawl with the jock that was supposed to be on, this chick 
[01:51:00]  that was supposed to be on, and told her to leave.  He's like, screw you, leave.  I'll do your shift.  And gets on there, hammered.  And just starts to do this.  I listen to this show every night.  Oh, hell yeah.  Yeah.  Thank you.  That's what we said.  For the most part, especially on these music radio stations, no one gives a crap with the  DJ standing between the records.  I'm like, oh my God, Frankie Blue is on.  I got to go home and listen to Frankie Blue just babble. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah, we play a game.  We guess what?  He's on.  Of course you would listen to this every day.  I would encourage this if I was the program director.  And you hear the music and that crazy, like perfect music.  That do, do, do, do, do, do.  Yeah.  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do.  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  50 grand prize.  And you know he picked this music bag, because this is what he was feeling, if you know what  I mean.  Oh, yeah.  Doing his little, you know, because he probably was just in the closet, just his little quasi  gay.  Two fingers in the air snapping and he's just. 
[01:52:00]  Got some glow sticks.  Yeah.  Just doing his hands in a helicopter.  Yeah.  With glow sticks.  shaking his hips  sucking on a lollipop  crawling across the soundboard  on his knees  with something in his mouth  being a cat  you want to hear more of Frankie Blue?  we got one more clip of Frankie Blue  I think this is where he's hiccuping  and we thought he cursed  I don't know  Mix 1027 
[01:52:30]  the new Mix 1027  this is Frankie Blue  and I am so excited for Tamar  Tamar  he does a Foster Brooks  so excited for Tamar  what was that?  that was your classic  drunken hiccup  he was the man  he hasn't been heard from since  this was it  I am so excited for Tamar 
[01:53:00]  I got Ricky and Rue  coming in in the morning  putting a hand in the big old barrel  and  picking out a $50,000 grand prize winner  the winner of the KTU  Mix 102 redo contest  and also you win a Toyota Scion 
[01:53:30]  now what's going to happen  is they're going to pull  they're going to put their hand in the barrel  they're going to pick out a winner  and then they're going to  f***ing that winner  he like dropped the F-bomb  to this point  we don't  it sounded like he said  we're going to blank the winner  yeah  and he also said the wrong  radio station in there  yeah right right 
[01:54:00]  yeah  oh it wasn't KTU  no  and he's the program director  they're trying to get this new thing happening  which went away after they fired him  now they're doing fresh  what are they doing over there  I forget  fresh  yeah he was talking about a station he used to work at  yeah  listen to him  basically you know  they F their own listeners  listen to this  they're going to put their hand in the barrel  they're going to pick out a winner  and then they're going to f***ing that winner  wait a minute  oh 
[01:54:30]  listen  the guy is so there though  if you listen to that one part again  he's  he's just  you know he's gyrating  he's building up with the music  yeah yeah  he's going 50  he's into  he's into what's going on  listen to  like how he builds up  with the  with the music that's playing  he's right there  someone else is saying that  Scions aren't even Toyotas  well it's a  it's a Toyota brand  it's a  made by Toyota  Toyota  are we getting a little too picky  yeah come on 
[01:55:00]  now what's going to happen  now what's going to happen  is they're going to pull  they're going to  they're going to put their hand in the barrel  they're going to pick out a winner  and then they're going to f***ing that winner  and that winner will be rewarded with everything  Mix 1027 Frankie Blue  what's happening  by the way  if you're in that format  your whole job is to make sure you shut the F up  before the vocals kick in  that he's so wasted  they start saying  but this is genius though  yeah 
[01:55:30]  I listen to this every night  and I hate that music  what do you got stunt brain  well we've analyzed that over and over a million times  and when he hiccuped before  that's exactly what it sounds like  when he's saying find  but putting that hiccup in the middle of the word find  makes it sound like  sound like the F bomb  yeah  yeah  and there's no way around it  it sure sounds like the F bomb toss  who knows  I love this guy  yeah  I miss him  somebody find him  he's here and he's trying to get back in the business  and he's actually  he's a decent guy  I think we've all  I've worked for him 
[01:56:00]  I've never met the guy  12 years  I could care less  to be honest with you  stunt brain has a soft spot  it's hard for him  that's alright  that's why stunt brain's been able to  last in this business for two decades  yeah  because he's nice to everybody  me I could care less  I've never met the guy  I think this is hilarious  you'd like him  and you could tell him  I'd listen to that every night  and he'd say  I wish it was back on  yeah  he's a good guy  alright  look at stunt brain  keeping his jobs  and keeping all options open  not burning a bridge  yeah  if you're just tuning in 
[01:56:30]  Saturday we did our comedy show  at the PNC Bank Art Center  the last virus show  ever  yep  we have to finally put it to bed  and one of the reasons  is because  a lot of the comedians  are scared to perform  in front of our audience  yeah  because they're animals  and we do have  just a couple quick clips  of Mike Birbiglia  getting booed  a guy that  is a seasoned comic  and the video's up on  onaradio.com  it's linked up there 
[01:57:00]  alright  we'll play a little bit  of the audio next  it's the Opie and Anthony  show  Opie and Anthony  Opie and Anthony  still a little tired  from the weekend man  we had a huge party  at the PNC Bank Art Center  Saturday  I heard about  10,000 people were there  maybe more  and for the most part  it was a success  but  yeah  we made the announcement  earlier  and it was something  we've been thinking about  for a while  but we're making it official  you just saw the last 
[01:57:30]  virus show  we had a really  really  really tough time  getting the lineup  together this year  a lot of people said no  a lot of friends  in the show  saying no by the way  don't be confused  a lot of people  that love doing  this radio show  but  you know  there's been a lot  of chatter  in the  comedy community  and quite frankly  there's a bunch of guys  not willing to go  in front of  our audience  because they've heard  the stories 
[01:58:00]  it all started  with Bill Burr  and Don Marrera  and Jimmy Schubert  down there in Philly  I remember that  three solid comedians  that have done  very very well  in their careers  but our fans  booed them  and then they  decided to boo  Bill Burr  in Cleveland  because they wanted  to recreate  the  Bill Burr  debacle  the whole  booing thing  and how Bill  turned it around  that was one  of those magic  moments  that just 
[01:58:30]  don't happen  time and time  again  so the fans  thought  they know  what's going  on  so they decided  we've got to  recreate this  moment in Cleveland  and that was  a real bummer  up there  and then we  moved on  and then we  did the  animation festival  where it was  all about  showing people  some animations  but Ant and I  decided  let's throw  some comedians  maybe some  newer guys  that they  haven't really  seen  as far as  our show  goes  and you know  they'll enjoy  that in between  some of the  animations  they decided  to boo  two out of  the three guys  the boo  Dan Natterman  and what's his 
[01:59:00]  name  Russ Neve  who's a very  good comic  hysterical  and then we  get to Saturday  see and because  of all that  stuff that we  just talked  about happened  it made  other comedians  kind of scared  to do our show  they said  screw that  I'm not getting  out there in  front of those  animals  well established  guys  so we had a  real tough  time getting  the lineup  together  the guys  that did it  they did  great  very happy  they did  the show  but  we're done 
[01:59:30]  we're done  we don't know  what else to  do  and we were  excited too  because the  show was going  so well  and then Mike  Birbiglia went  out there  and he just  got treated  like ass  he really did  whether you like  him or not  like we said  last time  the audience  didn't even  give him a  chance  before you  start booing  when you're  booing  after the first  minute  you're not  giving a guy  a chance  when he  came backstage  afterwards  it was just  like he  should have  been on the  ground 
[02:00:00]  with someone  over him  going  stay with  me Mike  stay with  me Mike  come on  come on  morphine  Carmen  and people  throwing it  back in our  faces  you know  that we  trained them  to be like  that  what do you  guys do  when someone  bombs on your  show  you boo  them  yeah  but you  gotta understand  the bigger  picture  you guys  did what you  did and now  we can't do  the show  anymore  we just  can't do  the show  anymore  it was a  so many  guys  so many 
[02:00:30]  guys said  no  to doing  the virus  show this  year  and then  Kenny  Kenny saved  everyone's asses  in the parking  lot  right Kenny  yes  yeah  because  you know  the tailgate  I think  is more  important  than the  comedy  show  you know  people  just love  that party  they love  the party  atmosphere  and to  make a long  story short  they started  arriving about  noon time  all right  and a few  people got in  started setting  up their tents  and setting up  camp and the  parties  well the staff  from PNC  doesn't get  there till 
[02:01:00]  two o'clock  so two o'clock  they started  shutting down  the parking  lot  and that's  when you  know security  and parking  staff the  troopers  get there  so when they  shut down  the parking  lot I got  a call  from brother  Elmo  and he's  like you  know help  so I had  to get the  building manager  all right  I you know  it took me  a while  it was a  process  because I  had to get  them on  board first  because you  know they  got a  history of  you know  kids  ODing in  the parking  lot  that's the  problem is  other shows  have really 
[02:01:30]  kind of ruined  it so  we were  talking to  some of the  troopers  saying you  know obviously  they were doing  what they were  told to do  but it's a  different  situation  we do have  animals once  they get in  there and  the booing  and all that  and stuff  but out at  the tailgate  parties it's  one of the  most peaceful  crowds you're  going to see  it's a lot  of fun  absolutely  people you  know they're  drinking and  barbecuing and  stuff but I  think never a  problem and I  think in all  fairness most of  those guys get  it they get  the absolutely  they get the  bigger picture  like all right 
[02:02:00]  I might not  like one of the  guys that Opie  Anthony picked  for this show  but I'm not  going to sit  there and be  you know boo guy  because I know  I want to  continue partying  in the parking  lot with the  ONA community  and I want to  go to other  events because  it's all  encompassing  some people just  hang out for the  tailgating  they never go  inside  I know  they never go  inside  I know that  they said there  was eight  something inside  and I'm thinking  there was probably  close to what  a thousand people  outside  I don't know  but they're saying  there was about  10,000 people  there  I don't know 
[02:02:30]  if they were  all inside  the venues  is what I'm  saying  but go ahead  one thing  we don't have  like an  underage crowd  too  so that was  one thing  in our favor  regarding the  tailgating  so I get the  building management  on board  because they  have a blanket  policy  only open the  doors  parking lot  two hours  before show  time  then I got  another call  from Brother  Elmo  not only did  they close  the parking  lot  now they're  kicking  everybody out  so now  I know  I gotta do  something  so I'm 
[02:03:00]  talking to  the building  so I say  can I talk  to the  troopers  and I want  to thank  the New Jersey  State Police  wholeheartedly  and Live Nation  for letting us  have our  tailgate party  but when I'm  out there  talking to  the troopers  and I'm  doing some  double talk  to try to  convince them  we gotta have  our party  here  and this  is what proves  that the fans  are their own  worst enemies  somebody yells out  fight the power  Kenny  yeah  just shut 
[02:03:30]  up  that's the  last thing  a trooper  wants to  hear  yeah  like I  just got  they're on  the fence  and I got  them you know  you know  to almost say  yes  you know  I'm promised  there's not  going to be  any problems  you know  and then all  of a sudden  you know  they're yelling  out  you know  and the trooper  told me  he said  he goes  we got a  bunch of  people outside  that want  to come in  he goes  and they're  looking at  the people  that are in  here  and they got  tents set up  and they're  barbecuing  and they're  wondering why  they can't  he said  to me  he goes  so he 
[02:04:00]  goes  look  just make  it look  like  you guys  are taking  some stuff  down  and you know  so at least  we can tell  them yeah  we're making  them leave  but he  he pretty  much told  me  look  just  give it  a good  look  make it  look like  you guys  are leaving  right  and uh  yeah  that was my  biggest bargaining  point is that  they weren't  consistent  and it wasn't  fair to have  some people  in then turn  others away  right  you know  so  well  we got a guy  named fear  in New York  City  I feel bad  for Mike  Birbiglia  he should 
[02:04:30]  have been  given a shot  but it was  also just  bad timing  that he came  on after that  stupid car  giveaway  that really  sucked with  the camera  continually going  off and the  crowd was not  happy  I was so pissed  off about how  the car giveaway  went down  that it was  supposed to be  it was supposed  to be on stage  in front of the  8 to 10,000  people and then  Pete told me  well we can't  get on stage  but he goes  but we can  do it on the  side of the  stage  I'm like okay  at least that  side of the  stage and the  lawn people would  would get into  the excitement  of the thing  and then we  show up at the  venue and he  tells me we  have to do it  backstage  I'm like how  is that gonna  work 
[02:05:00]  and then the  camera guy  and he's been  with us a while  he tripped over  his own wire  and he ripped  out his cords  and then they're  duct taping it  and that's why  the damn thing  was going on  going off  going on  going off  and we should  be prepared  for all this  stuff  can I say  from a common  standpoint  the lineup  too  in Birbiglia's  defense  the lineup is  Voss  who had to do  the taming  then it was  Di Stefano  strong  a strong  like a comic  that should be 
[02:05:30]  there  Di Stefano  then after him  is Bobby  who killed  before  because they  know him  Bobby should  have been  way later  in the set  then it's  Otto  way later  in the set  then it's  me  very early  in the set  then  then  it's  intermission  and so that's  drinking  and then a  cup of weight  and then your  doodoo on the  lip video  actually  then I  followed  the doodoo  on the  lip  video  then after  that  it was  an evening 
[02:06:00]  with Jim  Brewer  who  headlined  well he was  the special guest  but wait  he destroyed  let me explain  what happened  with Brewer  like he was  really nervous  because he  hasn't performed  in front of  the ONA crowd  in a long time  and we all  knew that  he could have  done the ABC's  and the fans  would have loved  him because  they haven't  seen him  in so long  but that wasn't  the case  he had great  material  it was amazing  but he goes  dude I only  want to do  10 minutes  I'm not really  feeling this  it's been  too long  I just want  to kind of  go out there  say hi  tell a few  jokes  get off  I'm like  dude that's  perfect  and that's 
[02:06:30]  wonderful  we figured  out he was  up there  for 40 minutes  that's how  much fun  he was having  it was a  royal performance  with Jim  Brewer  then after  Jim kills  there was  the first  half of  the car  giveaway  with the  camera going  out  after we  went to  Greg  Giraldo  I started  asking people  how did  that look  and we  were excited  because we  thought we  were doing  okay with  what we  were doing  with that  dumb  thing  and then 
[02:07:00]  I find  out  some camera  problems  I'm like  you gotta  be effing  kidding  me  Giraldo  goes up  and they  were welling  up but  Giraldo  was a  trooper  I was  sitting in  the audience  watching it  Greg Giraldo  killed  then the  car giveaway  not only the  car giveaway  finale  25 tender  little delicious  things that  come and dance  around the  winter  and then 
[02:07:30]  ladies and  gentlemen  Mike  Birbiglia  ladies and  gentlemen  a guy  we don't  really know  well that's  why I was  surprised he  was so late  in the show  too that's a  tough spot  you gotta get  the guys  you know  late in  the lineup  that have  been around  a while  well if  someone said  no no it'll  be great  it'll be  great this  way  trust me  it'll be  great  I heard  that  that wasn't  a good  idea  and this  is what  happened  all right  all right 
[02:08:00]  I don't  know  yeah  what are  you doing  how come  all right  you guys  I'm gonna  sit like this  until people  cheer  he sat down 
[02:08:30]  he's like  all right  I'll just  sit until you  stop booing  and I  can't stress  enough  this is what  hurts us  as we try  to get  other comedians  to do our  show  yeah  it's over  Johnny  I'm telling  you  there's nothing  else we  could do  the list  of people  that said  no  I was  amazed  by  and  they  didn't  want to  admit  it's  because  of this  type  of  reaction  or  this  type  of  treatment 
[02:09:00]  but  we  all  knew  you  know  that  was  you can  hear  and then  Mike  did a great  thing  and he  almost  got him  back  he decided  all right  I'm gonna  go in the  audience  and ask  these people  why they're  booing  and no one  had a really  good reason  why they  were booing  funny 
[02:09:30]  yeah  and he got  a good laugh  he kind of  got some  laughs  and then  they just  turned on  him again  you know  well  what was  really  cruel  well 
[02:10:00]  first of  all  that came  up a lot  that they  were booing  because he  was wearing  a sweatshirt  well yeah  that's a good  reason to  and then  the sick  F's  I don't  want to say  this is funny  but if you're  gonna boo  it's kind of  clever  they allowed  Mike  they all  would just  be quiet  to hear a  joke  but they  weren't  really  hearing the  joke  they were  just waiting  for the  joke to  end  and then  they would  start  booing  again  that's  how  sick  some 
[02:10:30]  of  these  guys  are  oh that  is  evil  so all of a sudden  Mike's up there  feeling good  he's like okay  they're gonna quiet down  let me do my  stuff but they  didn't want to hear  his stuff anymore  they just wanted  to really make it  hurt  so they  were quiet  enough  for Mike  to tell  one of his  little jokes  and then  they would  boo  I think we  might have  that here  this is my  I'm not gonna  do  Bill Burry  first  but I will  do  the  first  to this  guy  hey  do you  Bill Burr  impersonation  that's funny  that's that 
[02:11:00]  that was that  conversation  right now  alright  I  alright  I  listen you guys  hey  who do you guys  like  Jim Norton  that's him  throwing the mic  and walking  off stage  that's how  he ended  it  and then  someone  writes  why didn't  you and  aunt  go out  there  and tell  him to  stop  booing  oh  stop  that  never  that's 
[02:11:30]  the last  thing  a comedian  wants  is us  to go  out there  and try  to help  him  out  and it  doesn't  work  that's  like  your dad  coming to  school  to take  care  of  the  bully  for you  hey  now  you're  going to  come out  like  the  teacher  right  when  the  auditorium  is  acting  up  when  the  class  president  what can  I tell  you  what can  I tell  you  look like  he was  shell  shocked  left  early  because 
[02:12:00]  of the  audience  Sean  what's  up  buddy  hello  hey  Sean  hey  I was  in about  the  seventh  row  during  the  show  and  everybody  that was  booing  around  us  they  kept  talking  about  how  they  were  from  New  York  so  I  just  wanted  to  say  that  it  wasn't  a lot  of  the  Jersey  people  it  was  mostly  the  New  York  people  and  they  were  hammers  they  were  just  booing  I  think  they  wanted  another  Bill  Burr  rant  that  he  did  down  in  camp  you  can't 
[02:12:30]  redo  a  moment  people  don't  understand  that  they  think  I'm  going  to  be  part  of  this  shut up  stop  booing  moments  are moments  for a  reason  like  everything  aligns  perfectly  you  can't  recreate  that  stuff  you  just  gotta  let  it  happen  why  wouldn't  they  do  that  with  anybody  else  on  the  show  like  why  was  they  why  was  Mike  the  target  of  unfamiliar  to  our  audience  they  just  don't  want  to  sit  through  it  and  so  how  are  we  supposed  to  bring  on  newer  guys  that  might  be  great  you  gotta  start 
[02:13:00]  now  and  then  by  the  next  virus  in  2009  people  will  know  we're  done  I'm  serious  already  had  the  conversation  we're  done  it's a  good  place  to  put  this  to  bed  we  did  14  or  15  of  them  it  was  so  tough  getting  this  one  together  I  miss  you  guys  a lot  of  sleepless  nights  a lot  of  stress  what  do  you  mean  he's  saying  no  well  you  know  huh  unbelievable  that was 
[02:13:30]  the  big  all  right  I'm  right  can I  say  where  you  gonna  be  this  weekend  oh  man  of  course  Patrice  where  you  gonna  be  at  the  punchline  on  Thursday  Friday  and  Saturday  in  San  Francisco  California  it's a  great  comedy  I'm  one of  my  top  five  in  the  country  I'll  be  on  my  top  five  tour  what  makes  it  such  a  good  club  because  I  was  out  there  seeing  Norton  it's  a  lot  of  people  and  I'm  at  punchline  it's  intimate  and  but 
[02:14:00]  there's  a  lot  of  people  it's  like  a  250  seater  but  it's  very  in  your  face  and  what's  weird  is  it's  such  a  liberal  city  and  a  lot  of  liberal  cities  and  comedy  it's  a  little  weird  but  for  some  reason  it  works  there  they're  beautiful  man  they don't  mind  you  going  after  all  the  no  no  no  they  like  it  and  there's  a lot  of  Asians  in  the  audience  which  is  amazing  yeah  you like  that  it's  just  interesting  big  ones  that  behead  people  beheading  ones  no I  get  the  little  ones  Canada  gets  those  big  juicy  ones  beheading 
[02:14:30]  ones  start  eating  you  god  damn  what a  nut  let's  go to  Kevin  Kevin  what's  up  buddy  hey  well  yeah  we  pretty  much  begged  everyone  to  cool  it  after  the  animation  festival  just  because  we  had  the  big  picture  in  mind  we  wanted  to  protect  this  thing  and  let 
[02:15:00]  it  survive  but  we  don't  know  what  else  to  do  we  gotta  just  say  goodbye  to  well  the  Vegas  show  was  pretty  solid  back  in  the  day  alright  thank you  Kevin  alright  brother  we're  off to  XM  you guys  Patrice  thank you  you were  great  today  and  everyone's  talking about  Patrice  and his  comedy  lately  they should  have been  talking about  your comedy  years ago  by the  way  but  he did  the  Montreal 
[02:15:30]  comedy  festival  and he  was the  talk of  Montreal  which is  really  really  big  in this  business  and you  know  it  too  you're  not  even  going  to  downplay  it  everybody  was  talking  about  what  you  were  doing  up  there  and I  think  it  has  a lot  to do  with  his  new  attitude  the way  he dresses  now  dresses  better  thank you  sir  thank you  Mr. Anthony  thank you  Mr. Anthony  sir  and he's  wearing  a dead  guy  hat  what 
[02:16:00]  blues  guy  dead  guy  hat  oh  like  dead  blues  guy  yeah  who  just  died  that  had  a hat  like  that  BB  no  BB's  still  alive  who's  the other  dude  who died  Muddy Waters  not Muddy Waters  Bo  Bo Diddley  you got the Bo Diddley  Bo Diddley  I gotta change this  good luck though  alright our music's over now  let's get out of here  alrighty  good morning people  welcome to XM 
[02:16:30]  Sirius Radio  Sirius XM Radio  Sirius XM now  Sirius XM  Satellite Radio  is what it's called  Sirius XM  I would imagine  that they're gonna  take that and make it  into one thing  eventually right  Sirix  I don't know  because  Sirix  I think there's a reason  they didn't come up  with a new name yet  maybe because it's on  too much packaging  because they never knew  that the merger  was actually gonna happen  because how could  Sirius XM  Satellite Radio 
[02:17:00]  be  a good product name  rolls off the tongue  like a cinder block  that's just like  saying Pepsi  or  yeah  you know  Sirius XM  Satellite Radio  Sirius XM  it's like open  it's the knee  an anthem  how many days  I'm assuming  this is the week  they start talking  to Super Agent  Bob Eatman  right  well I would hope so  how many days  57 days  57 days  left in our  contract  plenty of time  plenty of time 
[02:17:30]  like Christmas  isn't it  or something  we're going away  for a week  you know  so there's  nine days  there's nine days  so if we get to  Friday without them  talking  then add another  nine days  onto that  then it's starting  to get a little  scary here  a little bit  we'll be fine  either way  we'll figure it  all out  in the end  right  speaking of  satellite radio  I guess  Bubba  the love sponge  is now backing  off some of  the things  he said  oh really  what happened  these clowns  that we  that we're  in this business  with  bunch of 
[02:18:00]  clowns  well  first of all  he's saying  he doesn't  understand why  we attack him  but  the only time  we've ever  even thought  of that guy  was when he  gets on the air  and says  something about us  and it gets  back to us  like he's  he's said  plenty of stuff  I'm sure  but only  until he gets  back to us  and it's  really ridiculous  do we even  bring anything  up  for the most part  who cares  what he says  we don't  openly search  out our  enemies  it's usually  because 
[02:18:30]  one of our  awesome fans  I like to  call him  awesome  awesome  you're an  awesomer  how many  awesomers  do we have  listening to us  unless they're  in front of  a festival  crowd  and they're  horrid people  not all of  them  but we don't  know what  else to do  yes  all of  them  that's the  dilemma  we know  most  most of  them  behave  but  that's why  I keep  yelling and  screaming  squash the  haters  because  there's a  bigger picture 
[02:19:00]  here  we're trying  to look  at  yeah  but my  freedom  shut up  you're not  a fan anymore  you're a  hater  and that's  your whole  reason for  living  is to  hate  everything  we do  and explain  why it  sucks  and it's  not like  the old  days  that means  you're not  a fan  anymore  that's  all  what is  like  the old  days  shut up  that's  fine  if you're  not a  fan  anymore  that's  fine  but don't  claim you  are and then  do all that  hating  all the time 
[02:19:30]  I'm not a  puppet  yep  so Bubba  doesn't understand  why we  continue to  attack him  but we  weren't  even acknowledging  him until he  got back to us  that he was  trashing us  yeah  that's the  only time we  talk about  this guy  I don't  give this  guy  a piece  of a  thought  unless I  hear somebody  say oh  did you  hear he  said something  about you  guys  like oh  what  yeah  I cut  this clip  down pretty  heavily 
[02:20:00]  this was  in total  this was  like a  13-14  minute  holy shit  rant  I trimmed  it down  to the  meat and  potatoes  you know  just like  a minute  and a half  but  no  what's  great  about us  too  what's  great  about us  sorry  they're  looking at  me  uncomfortable  but  uncomfortably  but like  when we  hear something  like  you know  Bubba  saying that  if ONA  are part  of this  new company  Sirius  slash  XM  satellite  radio  yeah  easy name 
[02:20:30]  that it's  a deal  breaker  for him  and then  we're  fortunate  enough to  talk to  Mel  Karmazin  who's  now running  Sirius  slash  XM  satellite  radio  yeah  he came  on our  show  and he  didn't  he didn't  go on  Bubba's  show  because  he's  only  going  on  the  important  radio  shows  that's  a fact  we all  know  that  Howard  and  us  and  we  didn't  think  he was  going  to  come  on  our  show  and  he's  like  wow  he's  showing  that  we're  important  by  coming  on  our  show  and we  were  quite  flattered  by that  great  show  of good  faith  right  there  I would  imagine  that  if you're  Bubba  the love  sponge  you're  kind  of  disappointed  that  the  big  guy 
[02:21:00]  is  not  coming  on  your  show  and  then  to  say  that  it's  a  deal  breaker  if  we're  going  to be  part  of  the  new  company  and  then  we  tell  Mel  Carman  what  Bubba  said  yeah  now  if  you're  Bubba  the love  sponge  you gotta  do  what's  called  a little  that  that  what  it's  when  you  take  the  pedals  yeah  and  instead  of  going  in  a  forward  motion  the  backstroke  yeah  yeah 
[02:21:30]  you're  all  full  of  piss  and  vinegar  going  one  way  and  then  you gotta  turn  around  and look  silly  showing  your true  colors  by the  way  that  you're  pretty  much  a  wimp  and  you  don't  mean  anything  you say  all full  of  piss  and  vinegar  that was  one of  my  old  man  statements  yeah  what  do  you  think  you  all  full  of  piss  and  vinegar  yeah  you  ain't  got  a  pot  to  piss  in  or  a  window  to  throw  it  at  her  yeah  that was  another  one  and then  everything  else  started  with the  n-word  so  is Mr.  Logan  still  he's done  he's done  he's done  officially 
[02:22:00]  done  he said  your mom's  box  it's over  the phone  no  he's officially  not an employee  he's wearing  Ofra  Winfrey  how about  the great  great  Don  Wicklin  I  would imagine  his days  are numbered  he could be  fired right  now  we don't  know  we don't  know  all  depends  so  here we  go  five  shoes  with  human  feet  have  been  found  on  beaches  since  last  August  what  actual  feet  right  not  just  the  sneakers  the 
[02:22:30]  feet  are  still  inside  in  the  shoes  can you  get this  audio  I've  been  I lost  my  sneakers  and my  feet  were in  them  right  they're  trying to  figure out  why  just feet  are washing  ashore  in sneakers  just the  feet  it's  fantastic  in the  sneakers  still  baffling  foot  mystery  that's  it  I know  every serial  killer wants  their thing  but that's  a weird  one  I saw  something  just crawl  across the  ticker up  there on  CNN  also  what  apparently  in Greece  what  a guy  decapitated  his girlfriend 
[02:23:00]  cut her  head off  this is like  becoming a big  thing  you know  that's major  surgery  you couldn't  do spine  oh my god  it's everything  that's in the  body has to be  cut through  the ligaments  major  nerves  arteries  veins  bone  spinal cord  there's a lot  of shit  to cut through  when you're  cutting someone's  head off  that neck  really is  kind of  the weak  spot of  this body  isn't it  let's have  fun  thin and  stupid  let's have  fun  listening  we'll get  to those  stories  absolutely  but let's  have fun 
[02:23:30]  listening to  what we like  to call  damage control  by Bubba  the love  sponge  with regards  to Opie  and Anthony  they admitted  to Mel  that they've  never met us  and they don't  really know us  so how can  they talk  the shit  that they've  talked about  us  well  because you  started it  you  first of all  I don't think  we ever  ever initiated  talking shit  about you  we could care  less about you  now  the person  that originally 
[02:24:00]  talked shit  about you  was Howard Stern  that I remember  hearing years ago  when Howard  would talk shit  about Bubba  and how he  doesn't want to  ever be in  the business  in a business  that has people  named Bubba  the love sponge  in it  and all that  stuff  that was the  first inkling  I got that  anyone named  Bubba existed  and then  I guess when he  got fired  it was in the  news  when he got  suspended  I'll be honest  when he got  suspended  for that pig  thing  that made 
[02:24:30]  the news  and then when  he was fired  went and ran  for sheriff  I guess  that was in the  news  I really don't  know  I remember  the pig  or was it  a boar  yeah a pig  same shit  no he's a boar  he killed a pig  see why you're  talking shit  why you're  talking shit  but uh  no those are  the only things  I knew  because they  were in the  news  yeah  and Howard  like goofing  on him  we never  never initiated  talking shit  about him 
[02:25:00]  because yeah  A we didn't  know him  from a hole  in the wall  and uh  it wasn't  why would we  do that  who gives a  shit  I'll be honest  with you too  we weren't  competing with  him  as we sit  here on  my daddy's  birthday  uh  I don't  even  it's alright  I don't  remember  uh  I know  he attacked  us and that's  why we  we did  what we do  very well  we attacked  back  I don't even  know what  he said  anymore  the original  thing  I think it  was something 
[02:25:30]  about because  he was going  too serious  right  and going  to be on  Howard's  channel  right  which uh  is like  you know  the the  person that  was lucky  enough to be  on after  Seinfeld  right  um  it was one  of those  things where  he then  talked about  our show  and how  we're failing  and gonna  fail miserably  and how  XM will go  down the  shitter  and so he  was just  talking shit  about us  right  uh  but again  he didn't  know us  from a hole  in the wall  either  right  so why  was he  starting shit  I don't  know  um 
[02:26:00]  now that  we're over  at XM  there's a  there's another  thing that's  going on  like we lost  Grand Rapids  Michigan  those guys  were trying  to say  that we  suck  and we  have no  ratings  and all  that  Anthony  and I  have like  a major  dilemma  that we're  trying to  figure out  this satellite  radio is  certainly hurting  what's going  on on  commercial  radio  and we're  trying to  keep the  two  you know  uh  floating  but it's  tough  because a lot  of people  go well  he's like  well your  ratings sucked  and you guys  suck  it's like  no we  don't suck  our ratings  in New York  are massive 
[02:26:30]  and on  satellite radio  we're pretty  much the  number one  channel on  the entire  network  yeah  but the  problem is  if you get  hooked on  this show  and you get  satellite radio  of course  it hurts  you listening  on the  regular radio  stations  and that's  our dilemma  and has  been our  dilemma  for about  a year  now  yeah  because I  love the  people that  are writing  to uh  they suck  now  no we  don't  there's  plenty of  stuff that  backs up  the fact  that we  don't  suck  Mel  Carmisen's  not going  on a  radio show  that sucks  but the 
[02:27:00]  haters  out there  they don't  want to  acknowledge  that part  of the  whole  fucking  puzzle  so here's  Bubba  doing what's  called  damage  control  talked about  us  and be the  sniveling  little  pussies  that they  are behind  their  microphone  if indeed  you know  to the  highest being  that we  have in  our  entity  they've  admitted  to him  that they've  never met  us  yeah  that's  amazing  and for  that matter  I don't  think they've  ever really  met Howard  either  no  they don't  know Howard  and I  still just  can't get  over the  fact that  they ask  their fans  their pests 
[02:27:30]  so to speak  or their  virus or  whatever the  hell they  got  probably both  they probably  they're  faggots  that's not  that's not  good  you don't  you don't  want to  rile them  up  believe me  they're  uncontrollable  virus or  whatever the  hell they  got  probably  they're  faggots  for the 
[02:28:00]  life of  me  man  you know  I'm not  going to  question  Mel  as to  why  he  went  on  there  he  you know  obviously  was trying  to get  the word  out  but  not  going to  question  Mel  here  let  let me  fill you  in on  why  Mel  came  on  our  show  because  we're  the  show  to go  on  on  XM  as  Howard  is  the  show  to go  on  Sirius  you  are  an  offshoot  on  Howard's  channel  that's  all  Howard  gets  Mel  to go  on  his  show  on  Sirius 
[02:28:30]  and  since  the  merger  went  through  Mel  decided  to come  on  our  show  to show  his  good  faith  to  this  program  that  is  doing  very  well  on  XM  there's  no  fucking  mystery  there  it's  so  easy  to  figure  out  is  Mel  going  on  fucking  the  Bob  Edwards  show  no  he  did  did  he  no  he  didn't  why  would  he  go  on  that  show  there's  no  one  listening  awkward  fuck  awkward 
[02:29:00]  god  I  should  have  dumped  out  of  that  no  he  went  on  Bob  Edwards  I  questioned  that one  too  to be  honest  with you  alright  so  now  the  CEO's  lost  his  mind  right  alright  put it  this way  he  didn't  go  on  the  70's  channel  did he  oh shit  he did  you should  have said  cinematic  XM  kids  cinemagic  cinemagic  he  didn't  go  on  cinemagic  he  went  on  fucking  Bob  Edwards  now  I  feel  special  anymore  honestly 
[02:29:30]  Bob  Edwards  never  did  as well  as we  did  but as  far as  that whole  NPR  world  goes  he's  still  somebody  boo  he's  a ghoul  yeah  oh that's  Bob  Edwards  and Mel  yeah  there's a  picture of  Bob  Edwards  and Mel  on  orbitcast.com  and very  ghoulish  you must  need a  very large  coffin  to sleep  in at  night  there it  is  yep  Mel  so  on a  Bob  Edwards  oh well  fuck me  in the  mouth  yes  welcome 
[02:30:00]  Mel  Carmisen  welcome  boo  but there's  no real  reason for  Mel to  go on  Bubba  you know  Bubba's  show  there really  isn't  no  he's a  busy man  so here's  Bubba  after you  know  the faggot  thing that's  hilarious  question Mel  as to why  he went on  there he  you know  obviously  was trying  to get  the word  out but  for the  life of  me  I can't  understand  how  we would  want them  in any  capacity 
[02:30:30]  when they  are  have been  so adamant  against this  merger  and they  asked  within their  website  for people  to email  the FCC  to shoot  wrong  oh  wrong  oh  again  what  and Mel  Carmisen  knows that  didn't come  from us  you dope  we were  against the  merger  since when  how stupid  is this  guy  this guy  is just  blatantly  lying  on the  air  you're a  fat  lying  fuck  if  you're  getting  on the  air  and trying  to spread  a lie  like that  what are you  trying to

[02:41:30]  what  Mel  said  he goes  well  Bob  is  not  on  the  board  so  I  don't  know  what  kind  of  deal  breaker  this  means  and  then  he  talked  about  how  touchy  and  sensitive  the  deal  was  between  you  and  and  Sirius  so  that  was  coming  from  the  CEO  not  some  fucking  jock  that  is  lucky  enough  to be  on  Howie's  channel  and  sitting  there  kissing  up  and  backpedaling  time to  listen to  someone that  cares a  whole lot  every time  he doesn't  care  he so

[02:49:30]  they were playing  songs about me  sucking really bad  really  yeah  and I'm like  I was listening  to the station  because they played  heavy metal music  and I was working  Stuttering John  comes over to my  house in the Hamptons  we're hanging out  I said let's go  work out in the gym  we're working out  and I'm listening  to a rock station  so between  every song  they go  Bubba the Love Sponge  is coming  and then they would  play examples  of Bubba the Love Sponge  which was basically  my show  and then  like he played 
[02:50:00]  one song  that had  Kermit the Frog  singing about  sodomy  because that's  because he's crazy  he's wild  he's a wild guy  Bubba the Love Sponge  he's so wild  that he'll  have Kermit the Frog  singing about  sodomy  which was like  whoa  you know  I want to apologize  to Howard  because that's  basically what we're  saying  and I swear  we're not  ripping you off  oh my god  Bubba  that's the same  feeling we get  when we listen  to this guy  wow he's wild  he's unpredictable  you don't know  what he's going  to do next  so Bubba 
[02:50:30]  do you listen  to these tapes  at all  hey Bubba  do you remember  this  how does it feel  now  you're on his  team now  yeah  don't you feel  that it isn't  quite like  you're on his  team  as much as  you're his  fucking whipping  boy  hmm  you know  oh man  gee that's  different  is that a bit  from 20 years ago  well then I guess  on tape he comes  on and he goes  I'm gonna  Howard Stern  sucks  he's old  I think this guy's  older than me 
[02:51:00]  and he's been around  as long  Howard Stern  and they all yell  Howard Stern  sucks man  and you gotta  give me a chance  cause he sucks  and you I think  I suck  but you've gotta  listen to me  cause  cause  cause you know  maybe  maybe it's time  for the new  the new kind  of show  Bubba show  so I'm like  sitting to listen  to him  okay  you know  maybe he is better  than me  let's hear  what he's got  he's doing  Kermit the Frog  I mean  Jesus  there's your man

[02:52:00]  he's got to be  the same age  he's been around  for we've been  hearing that name  for 15 years  and wow  and this tape  is old  he's been around  a long fucking  time trying to  make it into  like the New  York market  and all that  shit  you know  it's one thing  to succeed  in Tampa  where Jacksonville  that's  that's  that's  kind of  impressive  but  he never  really made  it in the  big markets  no  but what's  really  what's mind  blowing is  I'm sitting  there working  out  and I'm 
[02:52:30]  hearing  bubble the  love sponge  talk about  how  I'm different  wait till  you hear my  show  and then  he's just  he's doing  you know  lesbian dating  games  and playing  he's not  even playing  a good song  parody  no bad  song parody  and the guy's  older than I am  been hacking  around all over  the place  well that's the  new thing  Howard's old  listen to me  don't remind  my age  Howard's old  listen to me  and you know  what  you're old too  just forget  my age  you're not  young man

[03:03:00]  whole thing  of the  defending him  back back  when when it  happened was  it's  you think  this is a  this is  you're trying  to stop  white people  i'm saying  nigga  white people  don't say  nigga  no  it's like  it's stopping  me from being  able to say  what the fuck  i want to say  yeah  and now  nobody  under any  circumstances  over at  the at  cbs  no time  can you say  the n-word  ever  under any  circumstance  under any  contents  not even  black people  can say it  if we wanted 
[03:03:30]  to  and how  crazy is  that  uh  it's really  crazy  makes no  sense  which was  the ultimate  plan in the  goddamn  beginning  was like  who the fuck  says that  no one  but white  people say  it at  home  yeah  black people  say it out  so so  this is the  this is it  porn is it  porn is  weird you know  yeah  slant  slant eye  for the straight  guy  which you know  some  it's a dude  just fucking  oh yeah  mami culo  grande  big puerto  rican  bitches  black power
