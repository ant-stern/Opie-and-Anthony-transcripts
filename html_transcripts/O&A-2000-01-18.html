<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show broadcast opened with a "Hummer Tuesday" segment, a sexually explicit discussion encouraging female listeners to perform oral sex on their partners.  Opie and Anthony engaged in vulgar banter, offering crude advice to callers who shared their experiences or plans. One caller recounted a humorous incident involving a woman mimicking the hosts' instructions on facial expressions during oral sex. Another caller, whose claims of screenwriting on *Saving Private Ryan* were later disputed, also called in.  The hosts mocked various New York radio personalities, particularly from CBS FM and 1010 WINS.  Opie played a song about a drunken night out, and snippets from other songs were also played.  The planned in-studio guest, Stephen Lynch, was mentioned, along with a discussion about the extreme cold weather and its impact on homeless people.

The show then transitioned to a discussion of an unnamed woman the hosts called a "dumb broad," followed by a morbidly humorous, fictionalized "Candid Camera" bit featuring increasingly outlandish and offensive scenarios involving Alan Funt's corpse. This segued into a segment focusing on "Psycho Mark," a listener live in Times Square outside MTV studios, attempting to get on TRL with a "WOW" sign. The hosts and callers provided live commentary as they watched TRL and coordinated Mark's increasingly erratic behavior, which included jumping and running dangerously close to traffic.  Callers reported on Mark's actions and the reactions of bystanders and police.  The hosts discussed previous stunts by Psycho Mark and brainstormed future ones, including involving women.  The upcoming in-studio guest, Stephen Lynch, and CBS FM's criticism of the show were mentioned.  Chuck was also mentioned as an in-studio guest.  The segment ended with continued discussion of Psycho Mark and future plans.

Psycho Mark's antics continued as the show progressed, with him attempting to appear on various news broadcasts throughout New York City.  Callers described his appearances, often providing detailed accounts.  Mark had some success, appearing briefly and blurry on several channels, and even interacted with a female companion willing to expose herself on live television.  His attempts to appear on ABC news, involving a crane and a listener offering assistance, were detailed.  Stephen Lynch made a brief in-studio appearance, discussing his gigs and new album.  The show also included the announcement and giveaway of the pornographic film "Opie Goes to South Central," with a description of its content and distribution, and a trailer for the blaxploitation film "Soul of a Nigga Charlie" was played.

Comedian Stephen Lynch's appearance as a guest dominated a significant portion of the show.  The hosts read listener emails to Lynch, including highly offensive and threatening messages detailing violent acts, specifically against his anus. Lynch reacted with humor and nonchalance, even commenting on the quality of some of the hate mail. He played his song "The Pope Sucks Me" and mentioned another song he wanted removed from circulation, leading to humorous speculation about his potential departure.  He promoted his upcoming shows at Rascals. After Lynch left, numerous callers shared anecdotal stories, many involving people with prosthetic limbs, often with crude humor and graphic descriptions of accidents. Racially charged observations on game shows like *Wheel of Fortune* and *Who Wants to Be a Millionaire* were also discussed.  Psycho Mark then rejoined the show, recounting his TRL appearance and anticipating its replay.  The segment closed with more caller interactions, including a song about Cuban refugees ("He Floats Good"), discussions about Anthony's "free penis," a "What Did We Learn" segment summarizing the bizarre events, a prank call promoting a rival radio station (RCN), and plugs for upcoming events and the show's syndication.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  Dudes with Tudes.  I think every time we open our mouths, we're pissing someone off.  We'll be an Anthony.  We're out of control. We're so wacky.  All right, knock it off.  1027 WNEW.  What?  Where are we?  Hey, dude man.  What's up, Anthony?  How you doing?  I'm doing okay. That's what I am.  Cool.  That's right.  1027 WNEW. 
[00:00:30]  Hummer Tuesday.  Two DJs that don't have to put on a fake radio voice over there.  A voice.  Every other radio station in New York has to have the fake voice to go home with that voice.  Honey, honey, what's for dinner?  I hope it's some of that steak.  I really enjoy that steak.  Honey, come over here and give me a Hummer, you bitch.  It's Hummer Tuesday.  Come on, start hopping my knobs.  From CBS.  Do you think they talk like this at home, Anthony? 
[00:01:00]  Absolutely every day.  Hey, son, you do your homework.  Oh, no, you can't have the keys to the car.  Unless you're the 101st caller.  All right, it is Hummer Tuesday, Anthony.  Yes.  We are looking for the fine ladies of our radio audience to hob some knobs today so their guys  could be a member of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Yes.  Very happy.  It's a perfect day to do it because most people try to stay inside and stay warm and all that 
[00:01:30]  crap.  Yes.  Snuggle up to a warm knob.  Hob.  Hob.  Knob.  A warm knob.  Now the sounds of a warm knob being hobbed.  212-757-1027.  If you want in on the show today, let's go to Danny.  Danny, you're next on the radio show.  What's up?  Hey, everybody.  Bend over here.  Remember all you pedophiles.  It's the Nambla picnic on Saturday.  Blow up your parole officers and come on down. 
[00:02:00]  The main course is going to be pluck chicken.  You should have got a job over there.  That's hysterical, man.  You almost have the voice down.  That is hysterical.  You guys are great at it.  I can't come nowhere near it.  Hey, can you do me a favor to play a little later on?  Can you play a little of that, what was it?  The, uh, oh, holy free eye.  Uh-oh, mental body.  Not even doing any bondage.  You've got to get off the drugs, son.  I'm trying, man, but it's tough, man.  I'm just thinking about young boys.  But, uh, oh, what was it? 
[00:02:30]  The camera bit, that's it.  The Alan Funt stuff, man.  Alan Funt.  Oh, we haven't played Alan Funt in a while.  Maybe we'll do a new Alan Funt.  Yeah, that'd be great, man.  All right, thank you, Dan.  Hey, thanks a lot, guys.  Take it easy.  Great show.  Take it easy, Danny.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye-bye, Danny.  Rob, you're next on the radio show.  What can we do for you that'll happen to do?  You almost killed me.  You had me.  I had no, I had soda pouring out of my nose.  I was eating, and I had a full glass of water, and it just came all out of my nose. 
[00:03:00]  My eyes are still teared.  Well, look at that.  A lot of people seem to appreciate this.  You can do that.  You can do this for the whole show.  Well, a few people thought it went on a little too long.  Half time.  That's all right.  All right.  Thank you, Rob.  No problem.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Tara, you don't even have to, like, pronounce the words.  No.  It just has to sound good.  Let's make sure you're by the law.  Tara, what's up?  Oh, my God.  You guys are killing me.  I went to go pick my little brother up from school, and I got in the car. 
[00:03:30]  I thought I had CBS FM on.  I'm like, what the hell is this?  And then I came home.  My grandma, she kills us every time you set foot in her car.  We shouldn't be driving in the first place.  That's the grandma station.  It is the grandma.  Now these words from Dependt, undergarments.  Oh, my God.  Don't kill yourself.  I just want to tell you guys, man, you guys rock.  I was out in school for a year in California.  I didn't even know about you guys.  Damn.  I got a call from my little brother and my dad. 
[00:04:00]  He's like, oh, my God, you got to hear these guys, you know.  Oh, my God.  Listen to me.  And I got back, man.  I'm telling you.  All right.  You guys really rock.  Well, thank you, Tara.  Thanks a lot, you guys.  All right.  Bye.  Later.  All right.  Margaret, you're next on the radio show.  It's WNN.  Ah!  Hold on, Margaret.  Hold on.  Whoa, wait a minute.  That's Britney?  Yeah.  That's the little outfit she was wearing?  Yeah, last night.  Zoom in, you peckerheads.  Oh, man.  They had plenty of shots of her zooming in, Anthony, last night. 
[00:04:30]  I missed it.  Britney Spears had the most incredible top on a, what was it, the Billboard Awards or  something like that?  The American Music Awards.  The American Music Awards.  Oh, the fake award show that Dick Clark decided to event?  Yeah.  Is that those awards?  It's not a real award.  No, Britney Spears' boobs are fake.  Who cares?  She's only 18.  Come on.  No, she said that they're not fake.  Yes, they are.  The reason they were smaller in previous pictures is because she hadn't developed fully yet.  That's right.  That's not true.  I like to believe that.  And if you saw... 
[00:05:00]  Wait, did you see Mariah Carey's outfit?  Yeah, but Mariah's like, I don't know, she's turning really like...  She's getting a Simeon look to her.  Yeah, she's turning like slutty.  Did you see her dress?  They just show that, too.  I wasn't as turned on as Britney Spears.  Oh, my God.  I thought that was so hot.  I like the new whore.  I like Britney Spears, the new whore.  Britney Spears is happening.  She's youngin'.  She's a youngin'.  I mean, what do they do when girls decide to wear those type of tops, Anthony?  Do they have to, like, you know, put, like...  Crazy glue.  Double-sided tape on their nips to make sure the boob isn't going to pop out when they're 
[00:05:30]  walking around?  Yeah.  Maybe.  Because I got to see that now.  Where the hell is that?  Oh, we got it in the office.  We got it in the office.  Yeah.  Margaret, what's up?  Hi, guys.  I just want to tell you, I cannot stop laughing from doing that CVS thing.  I was dying.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Well, you guys sound just like them.  It's so funny, because, like, I don't even know who, like...  I don't...  Honestly, I don't know any of the DJs over there, but one of them, like, was trying to  make fun of Ant and I.  Oh, forget that.  Let's stop barking up the wrong tree.  It's like, please.  First of all, we don't care. 
[00:06:00]  Right.  That's, like, the first thing.  And secondly, we'll just have fun with it and go off.  Oh, you guys can make, like, a four-hour show out of this.  We don't care.  All right, Margaret.  Have a great day.  You, too.  Bye.  Thank you.  Jamie, you're next on WNAW.  What's up today?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  It's Jamie.  All right.  Listen, man, you know, after listening to you guys, I can figure out that I can talk  like this, too.  Hey, it's I'm a Dick on CBS FM.  Hey, you got it.  That's right.  Right here.  It's the Laugh and Lodi.  All right.  Hey, um...  You're there.  Hey, that's right.  Hey, another...  You know, if you're a jock that talks like that, it pretty much means you just have no 
[00:06:30]  talent whatsoever.  So you're hiding up that fact with a great radio voice, everybody.  That's right.  That's right.  And I also have a...  You know, a lot of guys have been giving you some grief about how Rock's going to kick  your butt and stuff when he comes in.  Well, I like to be the first listener to step up and say, I have your back if you want it.  All right.  Thanks.  Yeah, Rock coming in Thursday for round two.  We'll see what happens.  You know, and one other thing, I like to give props to the guy that turned me on to you.  His name is Mikey.  He's my cousin.  All right.  And, uh, yeah, he turned me on to you guys, and I'm a follow listener, man. 
[00:07:00]  Hey, thank you, Jamie.  All right.  You take care.  We appreciate that.  All right.  Bye-bye.  All right.  Trying to move on, but they just want to talk about the CBS FM.  My God.  All right.  Dude, I tried to track the trailer for a living.  I was listening to you guys yesterday.  I should have said that.  Wait a minute.  You can't be saying the F word.  That slipped out.  I was laughing too damn hard.  You almost crashed the F in truck.  Cool, Craig.  Thank you.  That's good.  That's our goal is to get a track the trailer.  Guys, keep up.  Keep me laughing.  All right, man.  To turn it over.  Take care.  Bye.  Check out some innocent bystanders. 
[00:07:30]  All right.  Whoa, look at Bridget.  Bridget?  Line eight.  Oh.  I thought there was some hot girl in the hallway named Bridget.  And you go, whoa, look at Bridget.  I went like this and totally turned my eye like, where?  Now, Bridget's got a good question, I guess, for this Hummer Tuesday.  Bridget, what's your question?  Hi, guys.  Hi.  I need some advice.  All right.  It's my boyfriend's birthday.  Okay.  And I've never done anything like this before, but I want to give him a Hummer.  You've never gone south? 
[00:08:00]  No.  And how old are you?  19.  Is that bad?  Can I be your tutor?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Wow.  Well, Bridget, for a newbie, I guess, honestly, even a bad one's a good one.  Even a bad one's pretty good.  So you're not going to really do too badly there.  Just keep the teeth out of the way.  Yeah.  You've got to make a face like Charles Bronson.  You ever see Charles Bronson in The Great Escape or any of those? 
[00:08:30]  She's 19.  The Vigilante.  There you go.  Maybe you've seen the Vigilante.  You've just got to, like, wrap your lips around your teeth and go to town.  Yeah?  Yeah, you've just got to lay there and open wide.  And let us know how it goes, okay?  Wait, wait, wait.  What do you mean, lay there?  Or kneel there.  Whatever you want to do.  The Charles Bronson face works, though.  Now I'm confused.  Cover your teeth.  Okay.  Well, you're talking about oral favors, correct?  Right.  So I thought I wouldn't be laying there. 
[00:09:00]  Well, you could lay down.  You could sit up.  You could do a headstand.  Whatever the hell works for you.  There's many ways to give a hummer.  Yeah?  Lay down on your side.  You could get some good hand action in there.  Hand?  Yeah, a little hand action.  Yeah.  And at the base.  At the base?  Yeah.  And then just keep the head moving.  Yeah.  And before you know it, you'll figure it out.  Should I do that or should I just have sex? 
[00:09:30]  No, give him the hummer.  Give him the hummer and then have sex.  Yeah.  And when you give him the hummer, make sure you look up at his face.  Yeah?  Oh.  Yeah, your eyes should look like you.  Remember those?  I don't know if you'll remember, but remember those old paintings, Opie, with the kids with  the real big sad eyes?  Yeah.  That's what a girl's eyes should look like when she looks up at you.  There should be a little sparkle in them.  Very good.  You know?  So you can do that.  Okay.  All right, Bridget?  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  And remember, the underside, right below the knob. 
[00:10:00]  And it's very important to listen to whatever your boyfriend says.  Okay.  Now, this is your first time?  Yeah.  So you're not going to be used to accepting the byproduct of this, I think.  But I should, right?  Yeah.  You should finish it like that.  Okay.  Definitely.  Don't make it seem like all of a sudden, uh-oh, what did I get myself into?  What am I going to do with this?  Be a porn star.  Just think of the first time you had broccoli. 
[00:10:30]  You know, you probably didn't want that, but you just roughed it out and swallowed.  All right?  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Well, let us know what happens, okay?  Okay.  All right.  Thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Oh, my God.  That guy should just, like, get over here and give us money.  What's Rick's problem?  Rick, what's your problem?  Listening to you guys talking about how to give a hummer is going to turn me impotent, guys.  Why?  We're telling the girl how to do it.  Yeah, but eyes, as a stroke and hands, oh, I can't do it. 
[00:11:00]  Pictureing the girl doing it.  I am, but now.  I think Ant gave great advice saying make the Charles Bronson face.  Make the Charles Bronson face.  That's perfect.  And everyone's describing it like that.  With the hand going.  All right.  And the eyes like the old paintings with the big eyes.  All right, Rick.  True, true.  Have a good day, guys.  All right, man.  Later.  All right, listen.  Everyone's calling up about the CBS FM bit.  They want a request for the CBS FM DJs.  We've got to move on with our radio show, right?  Yes, please.  So as we go to break here, let's play Hummer Lovin' from Air Sick Productions. 
[00:11:30]  Airsick.net is their website.  And we'll be back.  Stay there.  Hummer Lovin' on Tuesday night.  Hummer Lovin' if you're so right.  I got my girl down on her knees.  Wonder if he will do me. 
[00:12:00]  Hummer's done.  Keyshawn is done.  Oh, I'll be the Tuesday night.  Hummer, hummer, hummer, hummer.  I'm home.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  We don't care where we are.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Do we fight in the cause?  She came to me.  I dropped my pants.  You owe this to all be an end.  I'll call the mutt when you go down. 
[00:12:30]  Over here's a slurping sound.  Hummer's done.  Get me some gum.  Oh, I'll be the promenade.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  I don't mean to offend.  Tell me more.  Tell me more.  Now can you do my friend?  I exploded.  That's where it ends.  I have got the world's best girlfriend. 
[00:13:00]  I love to be in Islam.  I think it's time.  I took a nap.  Hummer's done.  There's more to come.  But I'm a pro-comer now. 
[00:13:30]  I'm a pro-comer now.  I'm a pro-comer now.  I'm a pro-comer now.  This is O.P. and Anthony.  I, I, yeah.  This is, this is debauchery mania.  I, I, yeah.  Prostate exams for everyone.  1-1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W. 
[00:14:00]  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W.  It's the O.P. and Anthony show.  And then off to another fine start to the radio show.  Hell yeah.  A great first hour.  Our fax line is 2-1-2-9-5-7-9-6-3-9.  A little controversy on the phones here about my, uh, my Hummer advice for that 19-year-old  girl who's never given a Hummer.  Yeah.  What's up with that?  Well, let's start with TJ.  TJ, what's up?  Hey, what's up?  Well, let's go. 
[00:14:30]  All right.  I'm not even dealing with bad phones today.  We've got to hang up on bad phones right away.  TJ, call back if you've got a better cell, okay?  Let's go to, uh, Marvin.  Marvin, what's going on?  Hey, if you guys are going to instruct little girls about how to give Hummers, you've got  to tell them to, not to, not to swallow stuff, but they need to wear it.  Jesus.  Wear it on their faces proudly.  Oh, my God.  That's what you like out of your Hummer?  Hell yeah.  Well.  I want her to smile.  All right.  You don't want to scare her off, you know what I mean? 
[00:15:00]  Yeah, you've got to work into that slowly, I think.  You think so?  Yeah.  Yeah, that's a porn star move, man.  You can't go right for that.  You're doing like a porn star.  It's like going from third grade math to algebra, you know?  Yeah, you've got to start with the simple stuff first.  Yeah, but she said it's the first time, it's the guy's birthday, well.  She's used to just straight sex like that.  She probably has never seen any byproduct.  Well, if she doesn't like the taste, then she doesn't have to worry about it.  Be careful about describing that there.  All of a sudden, it's flying all over the place. 
[00:15:30]  She might get a little frightened.  Better work into it before you know it.  She'll be a regular Marilyn Chambers or something.  Well, then if you get one who's done it before and she wants to do something original, there  you go.  All right, Marvin.  Thank you.  All right, thanks.  Bye.  Bye.  Carmen, you're next on the radio show.  What's going on?  Hey, listen, Anthony, the way you were describing that, it sounds like you've given a couple  already in your life.  Oh, that must be it, Carmen.  Yeah, you're a homo.  That's what it is.  That must be it.  You're passing on the information, huh?  All I know is I know it works for me, and that's all I was telling. 
[00:16:00]  Yeah, get you a homo.  Get out of here.  Well, you're on to me.  Yeah, I'm there by the glory hole in the village every night, Carmen.  All right, buddy.  You must be a little angry having that girl's name to live with your whole life, Carmen.  Yeah, sure.  It's a chick name.  It's a chick name, Carmen.  What's that?  Carmen.  Carmen Electra?  Yeah, you got it, buddy.  Yeah.  How is it?  Carmen Electra, boy.  How's Rodman's Rod, huh?  Carmen Electra?  Yeah, Tony, you're relaxing.  Ah, you chick.  Listen to you.  What's your problem, man? 
[00:16:30]  Name like that?  You must have gotten beat up a lot in school, Carmen.  Yeah, sure.  A little angry.  What's that?  A little angry, are you?  No, not at all.  What should I be?  All right, man.  Yeah, yeah, listen to you.  I got no beef with you.  Yeah, sure.  I'll see you later, guys.  All right, Carmen.  Thank you.  I got into my fourth grade defense mode, Opie, and just started ragging his name.  That's all I know how to do.  I was pretty impressed, Anthony.  Thank you.  Joe, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How are you doing?  All right.  I was kind of actually curious if you guys have thought if you were going to the World  Wrestling Federation grand opening tomorrow to the restaurant. 
[00:17:00]  You going?  I actually had an opportunity to go, but got stiff.  I'm going.  Yeah, I think we're going to go.  I want to soften up the beaches.  I'm going to look because it's the day before The Rock comes in here.  Exactly.  So I figure if we give him a bunch of tequila or something, he'll be all hung over when he  comes in and an easier target.  We're not even going to get near him tomorrow night.  What if he comes up to you guys?  He won't.  Sure.  Yeah.  We'll let you guys know, though, what happens.  Definitely.  I wish I was going so I could give you guys some backup. 
[00:17:30]  All right.  You never know.  Maybe we'll catch him in the bathroom with mankind on his knees or something and have  something against him that we could use on the air.  You know what I mean?  All right, guys.  All right.  Take it easy.  Bye.  I think TJ's trying to get in here.  TJ!  Yeah.  All right.  Sounds better.  What's up?  Hey, O&A.  All right.  I was listening to you guys talk to a sweet, innocent, young, lovely Bridget there.  Yes.  And I'm sitting there in my car and I look over to my right and you guys are telling  her to wrap her teeth with her lips and everything. 
[00:18:00]  And this lady in the car is sitting right next to me and she starts doing the same thing  you're telling her.  I swear, I swear, she must have been listening to the same thing.  So anyway, she's practicing the face right next to you in the car?  Well, she was when you were saying it.  But listen, I'm driving right now.  I'm like two cars behind her.  Yeah.  Okay.  We're just going up Northern Boulevard here.  Uh-huh.  And, you know, she was hot, man.  I mean, what do I do?  Should I roll up next to her and ask her if she wants some tube steak to practice or? 
[00:18:30]  Hello, you have something for her to practice the Charles Brunson on.  Exactly.  That's funny.  She's practicing the Charles Brunson face while she's driving.  Well, we were sitting at a light, you know, and I'm just laughing.  I was just making sure that nobody's, like, sitting in there, you know, in their car looking  at me laughing at myself, you know, thinking I'm crazy.  And this chick is making a face.  It was the greatest thing in the world, man.  That's great.  So what do I do, man?  Well, if you catch up to her, call back and we'll try to make a love connection.  All right, guys. 
[00:19:00]  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  I knew this girl in high school said she practiced with her friend on a banana.  That's how she practiced.  Imagine that.  Kind of like Fast Times at Ridgemont High when they were practicing on the carrot.  Yeah.  They practiced on a banana.  I was laughing like a banana.  I'm much bigger than that.  Victor.  Yeah.  How are you?  Good.  Good.  What's up?  What about the dirty punk?  Don't you like to hear, hey, what a big twig you have?  What about playing with the berries and all that? 
[00:19:30]  Like Ann said, though, man, you've got to start with the basics.  And you're just giving her the basics and then let her run with it.  You know what I mean?  It's like when a mother bird teaches the bird how to fly.  You kind of push him out of the nest.  You push him out of the nest.  Let's see what she can do.  And the dirty talk, maybe the guy should do that.  Oh, no.  You like it, don't you?  Yeah, that's like Hummer 301, that course.  We're in the beginner course, Hummer 100.  Before you know it, you know, you're grabbing the hair and the ears and, you know, just slamming. 
[00:20:00]  But you made her look for a movie called A Vigilante.  It's a death wish.  I know.  Oh, death wish.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  All right.  Nice shift.  The guy's right.  When he's right, he's right.  It was a death wish.  All right.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Okay, we've got to take another quick break here, Anthony.  Don't forget Stephen Lynch coming into the studio today.  Yeah.  5 o'clock.  Do you have a new tune for us?  I'm praying he has a new tune because we've played the old ones to death here. 
[00:20:30]  That we can be barred from playing until it's screened and everything like the last time he was in?  No, we're allowed to just play it now.  We're back to the old Opie and Anthony show.  Cool.  But I figured as we go into commercials here, we'll give you a taste of one of Stephen Lynch's other tunes, okay?  All right.  But he'll be here around 5 o'clock today.  This is a song that I wrote actually a couple days ago after, excuse me, a friend of mine, my best friend, we went out to a bar and we got really hammered.  And we just had a really good time.  And I realized, you know, why not write a song about the good times that you have with your pal and you're out drinking at night? 
[00:21:00]  You know what I mean?  Sure.  So I wrote this for my best friend, my friend.  This should be cute.  I'm going to play that now.  I hope he's listening.  If you are, man, it's one for you.  Here we are, dear old friend. 
[00:21:30]  You and I, you and I, drunk again, laughs have been had, tears have been shed, maybe the whiskey's gone to my hand.  But if I were gay, I would give you my heart.  And if I were gay, you'd be my work of art.  And if I were gay, we would swim in romance.  But I'm not gay, so get your hand out of my pants. 
[00:22:00]  It's not that I don't care, I do.  I just don't see myself in you.  Another time, another scene, I'd be right behind you.  If you know what I mean, cause if I were gay, I would give you my soul. 
[00:22:30]  And if I were gay, I would give you my whole being.  And if I were gay, we would tear down the walls.  But I'm not gay, so won't you stop cupping my hand.  It's radio.  Yeah.  We've never hugged, we've never kissed.  I've never been intimate with your fist. 
[00:23:00]  But you have opened brand new doors.  Get over here and drop your drum.  We found a girl that could shoot stuff from a private area. 
[00:23:30]  More stupidity on the way.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  Quick musical break there.  Another track from the latest Kid Rock CD, Devil Without a Cause.  That song's called Only God Knows Why.  That was Hey Jude by the Beatles.  Did you hear a little of that at the end of that?  Just a little bit, Anthony.  Sure.  I almost heard it in the background. 
[00:24:00]  I'm wondering if you used it.  Also, well, they do that in today's music.  Yes, sampling everything.  Uh-huh.  God smacked before that.  And whatever.  Yeah.  Our phones just crapped out.  That always happens.  It's happening a lot lately, which isn't cool because we really need the phones for our radio show, Anthony.  I think it's because we get so many calls on this show.  Oh, thank you.  Well, that's what we like to think.  Yeah.  Hey, our favorite on-the-street reporter was at it again last night, Anthony. 
[00:24:30]  Oh, what?  Penny Crone.  Yeah.  She's such a tool.  What was she doing?  She's such a tool.  Remember what she did with the whole transit strike?  You want to refresh everyone's memory?  Yeah.  Remember when the subways were going to strike and the buses at 12 o'clock?  That's when they usually strike midnight.  Penny Crone was out on the street at midnight, and she said, right at midnight, she says,  well, I guess the strike isn't happening because I see buses driving by me right now. 
[00:25:00]  Like, at midnight, the drivers would jump out of their buses just leaving the passengers in the buses.  And leaving the bus.  And leaving the bus in the middle of the road or wherever.  Right.  Like, Penny, you schmuck.  She's such a tool.  Yeah.  Well, last night, you know, obviously, this cold weather has hit the tri-state area.  Oh, and the news loves it.  Oh, they can't get enough of this cold weather.  Penny Crone last night on the news.  Yeah.  Wanted to see how cold it was. 
[00:25:30]  So they had, like, a T-shirt, and they wetted it down.  And then they wanted to check.  I hope it wasn't on Penny.  No.  Oh, my God.  Who wants to see a wet T-shirt on Earth?  Whoa.  And so they pour water all over the T-shirt.  Yeah.  And then they check back with Penny 10 minutes later to see if it was frozen.  Oh, was it?  Of course it was.  This shirt is frozen.  So if you plan on wearing wet T-shirts out on a night like this, your best bundle up. 
[00:26:00]  And then there was something about clams.  And how the old bearded clams.  And how it's so cold, even the clams are frozen shut or something.  She is the worst.  But the weather people love this.  The weather geeks.  Yeah.  Well, another cold one coming in.  Isn't this Arctic clipper coming down?  Arctic blast.  Cold Arctic blast.  Going to be in our area for a couple of days now, so I'd suggest bundling up. 
[00:26:30]  Oh, who cares?  Exactly.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, how you doing, fellas?  Real good.  What's up?  I've got a very disturbing story to tell you.  I'm driving down Route 80 two weekends ago, and I'm seeing some road head going on.  I'm like, oh, this is great.  Let me follow this car a little bit.  I've got a little sweet I got.  I was disturbed for about three weeks, man.  Two weeks, whatever it was.  I don't know.  It was horrible.  Why are you looking?  Well, I've got some road head.  You know, you've got to follow a road head.  I didn't know it was two guys.  Right.  You know, it was a dude with long hair. 
[00:27:00]  Couldn't tell.  Well, that's pretty tragic.  It's horrible.  I'm very emotionally disturbed.  All right.  Well, thank you, Chris.  And unfortunately, I'm not a member of the club, so hopefully, maybe somehow I'll get broken in.  Well, good luck to you.  Well, thank you.  Of course, encouraging all the ladies to induct their guys into the Tuesday Night Harman Club, Anthony.  Absolutely.  And the guys, of course, should reciprocate.  Yeah, yeah.  You've got to pay back.  Oh, Joe in the Bronx, I've got another on-the-street tool for you.  How many times have you turned to 1010 Wins and not heard that guy, John Montone? 
[00:27:30]  John Montone?  I once heard him interview this guy on the subway strike, and he made him miss his train.  I swear, if Ant has ever heard him, you should start to have an impression of him, please.  Yeah, John Montone is very, very dramatic, no matter what he's reported on.  I'm here in the subway.  John Montone, 1010 Wins.  John Montone's news.  Yeah, we've heard that guy.  We joke.  The best at Wins is the weather guy that can't say his own name.  Dude, you know, the last time I brought that up, you were like, cut it out. 
[00:28:00]  It's not funny.  Will I say his name?  I won't say his name.  Do you know his name?  I think so.  Close enough.  There's a guy that, he's a meteorologist.  Meteorologist.  And he does the weather for 1010, every 10 minutes, right?  Yeah.  During his shift.  And man, if you want a good laugh, listen to him say meteorologist.  Listen to him try to say what he is, which is a meteorologist.  He's got a staff in the middle. 
[00:28:30]  I'm meteorologist.  Meteorologist.  Meteorologist.  I'm meteorologist.  How many times have I screamed for the radio while you're in the car where I just go, why  should you just say you're a weather guy?  You can't say meteorologist.  Stop trying.  Or have the guy he throws it back to go, that was meteorologist.  Right.  But he'll go, I'm meteorologist.  He just has a tough time in the middle of that word, man.  And it is blatantly obvious.  We're not even getting picky. 
[00:29:00]  Alex Sosnowski.  Oh, man.  Come on.  Is that his last name?  I don't know.  I made up with the winds people this past holiday.  I didn't attend the Christmas party like you did.  This Christmas party.  You dissed their traffic last year and then had to make up for it this year by going there  and kissing ass.  I did kiss ass.  I didn't attend.  Right.  We don't share a boss anymore.  We don't have to be courteous.  Meteor. 
[00:29:30]  Meteor.  I'm meteorologist.  You are so mean, man.  Come on.  It's funny.  Because when I brought it up like six months ago, you go, dude, that's not even funny.  We shouldn't have cared more six months ago.  You don't care as much?  Not about offending anybody or upsetting anybody.  I don't care.  Let the show roll over whoever it may.  There you go.  Jason, what's going on?  Hey, boys.  How's it going?  Real good.  Hey, what's up?  Yo, I'm calling just to let you know that Whitmer Wednesday has migrated to Puerto Rico. 
[00:30:00]  Oh, yeah.  What is that?  Why?  Well, I was out there for a little family vacation, and I was there.  Of course, it was Wednesday, and I was wearing my – I used to belong to this gym.  It was called Workout World.  So it just says WOW across it.  Sitting on the beach, and this chick walks by and goes, hey, WOW.  She's like, is that Opie and Anthony?  And I'm like, yeah.  Whangs.  Whipped them right out.  Oh, awesome.  So it migrated down there, boys. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah, it's all over the country at this point.  Hey, listen.  Or our world in the world, we should say.  Yeah.  I wanted to ask you guys something else.  I've sent you a couple of faxes over the last – whatever, since you first started.  Do you guys still play golf at all, or what?  Not when it's five degrees out.  Oh, no, not now.  Yeah, I know.  Nothing better than hitting one off the heel of the club in this kind of weather,  when you hit the shock up your hand.  It's like, wow.  We should have an Opie and Anthony, like, golf open, where we have, like, you know, 
[00:31:00]  beer girls and stuff, driving around in carts, topless and stuff.  Oh, can we do that?  Oh, yeah, that'd be awesome.  This spring, maybe.  We should do that.  I wanted to invite you guys to play, if you ever wanted to play.  Well, when –  In my country club in New Jersey.  Well, when April hits, we would love to.  Oh, dude, I'll definitely give you guys a call.  Yo, you guys are the best, keeping me warm on a cold-ass day.  All right, thank you.  Take care of yourselves, boys.  All right, bye.  That'd be great.  We would put the cunch in country club.  What? 
[00:31:30]  Am I missing a joke there, besides the obvious?  I couldn't say it the other way, Opie.  Oh, all right.  Unless you want to punch out.  No, that's okay.  But then it's only a joke for us.  Matt, what's up?  Hey, guys, how you doing?  Real good.  I was wondering if you caught that part when Penny Crone gave it back to the studio,  and I forget the guy's name, the announcer there, says,  yeah, it's not too much fun when your clam freezes up, either.  That's what the line was.  Thank you.  That's what it was.  I almost fell out of my bed.  I laughed so hard, I couldn't believe it. 
[00:32:00]  And I don't think anybody else did this to you.  Wait, wait, wait.  Because wasn't she also reporting about how they have to bring all the clams inside  because it's so cold now?  It gets below 10 degrees.  It's a little too cold for my clams, but I couldn't believe he actually said that,  that her clam was going to freeze up out there.  God, that is funny.  Hey, you guys suck, man.  Keep up the good work.  All right.  That was the line.  Thank you for helping me.  I'd have spit out my beer if I heard that.  Yeah.  Forget it.  Yeah, that was very good.  It's never fun when your clam freezes shut. 
[00:32:30]  John, what's going on?  Yo, what's up, man?  All right.  The other day, I saw Ziggy a couple blocks below CBGB's.  Uh-huh.  This is when it was real cold.  I think it was Friday night.  I'm not sure.  Oh, poor bastard.  Freezing.  He was drinking a big bottle of strawberry Yoo-Hoo in one hand, and he had some, like,  what was it, Smirnoff in the other?  Ah, there you go.  Yeah, it was a good chaser.  Well.  And I started talking to him, and he started complaining, not that it was cold out, but  that everyone with a, you know, with a windchill, everyone's like, with a windchill, it's 50 below. 
[00:33:00]  He started complaining, saying, why are they even saying that?  If it's 10 degrees, it's 10 degrees.  Don't tell me that it feels like it's 50 below.  That's from my grandmother.  She said it feels like it's 50 below.  So he was complaining that people aren't really tough nowadays.  I'm surprised that you were able to even understand Ziggy.  Oh, man, I had the thing going with him.  It was like we were connecting, you know?  We asked you guys, if you ever see Ziggy on the streets, to please give him your change.  I don't know. 
[00:33:30]  He looked pretty set up.  He looked like he had more money than I did.  Yeah, he was totally hooked up.  Well, all the locals in the area know him, so they do take care of him.  Yeah, I actually asked him if he wanted any food, and he said that someone had bought him  a pizza and stuff, some taki and whatever, so it was cool.  All right.  All right, man.  Thank you.  Later.  Bye.  Yeah, you wonder if the homeless guys out there in weather like this, you know, you  kind of feel bad, because it is 13 degrees, 10 degrees, and there's homeless out there.  But then you start thinking, are they so crazy they don't even know they're cold? 
[00:34:00]  Maybe that's it.  Like, I saw Opera Man downstairs.  Can we get Opera Man on the show today?  Is he still singing, you think?  He's still singing.  I'm like, I can't even go out and breathe.  Right.  I can't breathe or my insides freeze.  I have to hold my breath, run across to Associated, get something, hold my breath, run back.  I breathe, I die.  He's, like, taking these huge breaths.  More!  Like, hold. 
[00:34:30]  And he's only wearing, like, one coat.  Well, the shelters must be in really bad shape, because they've been interviewing a lot of  the homeless people.  Yeah.  With this Arctic blast that we're getting.  Yeah.  And most of the people say that they would rather be out in single digits than go into  these shelters for the night.  Why?  What's more bad with the shelters?  Are they like a prison?  One lady that looked like hell said that the shelters stick.  They stink.  Yeah.  Well, because the people stick.  That's what I mean.  Yeah.  Yeah. 
[00:35:00]  And you should have saw this lady, so they must be really bad.  Oh.  But they would rather stay out in the freezing cold than go into the shelters.  Wow.  They're still that bad, huh?  Uh, that's what, uh, they were getting at on the news the other night, so.  Hmm.  All right, Ant.  We have to take another break?  That sucks.  Why so many breaks?  Because, uh, we have so much fun, I guess.  Yeah.  The commercials load isn't any bigger or anything.  Okay.  All right.  We've got to get into some stuff here today.  Yeah. 
[00:35:30]  What?  We don't know, but we'll figure it out.  We'll work on it.  All right.  Stay there.  More of the show on the way.  212-757-1027 is our phone number.  We have that day.  Is this the best radio you guys can come up with?  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Hi.  It's Tuesday.  Ooh.  Looking for a bunch of people to join the Tuesday Night Hummer Club tonight.  Ladies, it's up to you. 
[00:36:00]  Guys love Hummers.  Yeah.  Especially on days like today.  Our fax line, 212-957-9639.  Coming in at 5 o'clock today.  Hey, Stephen Lynch.  Haven't heard from him in a while.  Is he playing somewhere?  I believe he's got a gig.  Usually now he only comes in when he's plugging stuff, Bo.  I don't know.  Usually he has a gig somewhere.  Well, let's not get stupid.  Just about anyone who comes in here is plugging something. 
[00:36:30]  That's true.  Not many people come in just to hang with us anymore.  Yeah.  They know how powerful this radio show is.  Oh, my God.  A dynamo.  It would be nice to see like a big celebrity just walk in the door.  Well, we do have one.  Jay Moore.  Yeah.  When Jay Moore comes in, he doesn't plug anything.  No.  I would like to see another celebrity just come in just because they want to be here.  I know.  Remember when we played that game, the biggest celebrity that listened to the Opie and Anthony  show?  Yeah. 
[00:37:00]  We played it when we, like, I think three weeks after being here.  Yeah.  And the biggest celebrity turned out to be a guy that played a dead body in a reenactment  scene on America's Most Wanted.  Well, then the second time we played it, though, it was encouraging because we had a soap opera  star call in.  Yeah.  A soap opera star.  And then that old bag, Sylvia Miles.  Sylvia Miles.  Won an Oscar.  Right.  She listened.  You want to maybe have that as an underlying little thing today?  We could do that.  We'll see how much better we're doing.  We went from a dead guy in a reenactment on America's Most Wanted to an Oscar winner, 
[00:37:30]  Sylvia Miles, an old Oscar winner and a soap star.  Right.  Now, let's see.  You think we could do better today?  I think so.  All right.  If you're a celebrity or you think you're a celebrity, yeah, call the radio show and say  hi to us today.  Right now.  We'll put you on the air and we'll see how big a celebrity listens to the Opie and Anthony  show.  All right.  Our phone line is 212-757-1027.  Okay?  Come on.  You're out there.  You know it.  You're listening.  And don't be all scared.  Call up. 
[00:38:00]  I want to hear from you.  Joey, what's going on?  Hey, listen.  As far as I'm concerned, Penny Krohn is the biggest celebrity you could probably get on  your radio station.  What?  We've had Jay Moore.  Are you a big Penny Krohn fan?  Yes, I am.  She's terrific out there in the streets.  Let me tell you something.  She works harder than you guys.  Is that a dig at us, Joey?  What's the matter, Joey?  Is Penny your grandma?  Hey, listen.  You don't need to make fun of Penny Krohn.  Hey, Joey, are you related to Penny Krohn?  I want to know why you're sticking up for her. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah.  Well, look.  Every night, I watch Fox 5, and I think she's a good worker.  She's out there in the cold.  Are you?  Christ's sake, it's zero blow to you.  Hey, Joey.  What do you want from her?  Joey, so do you watch Penny Krohn and pull out your junk and get all excited and stuff,  or what?  What's the matter with you guys?  What are you, sick or something?  Listen to this guy.  What's your problem, man?  Hey, man.  Listen, the woman works really hard.  You don't need to pick on her.  She has to do five minutes a day on the street.  Woo!  That's a tough gig. 
[00:39:00]  Well, compared to you guys, what?  Come in with your jeans on and sneakers and just sit on a chair and talk a lot of crap.  That's what she does, right?  That's pretty much what we do.  Thank you, Joey.  Yeah.  You described our job.  You're listening to us, right?  Well, I'm tuning the dial over and you can hear that crap you're giving out.  Accidentally fell onto the station.  Yeah, that's it.  That's exactly what we're trying to do.  Accidentally fell into the station, didn't you?  All right.  Yeah.  Well, say hi to Penny for us, all right?  Yeah.  Yeah.  Maybe she should try to be like Imus more. 
[00:39:30]  Oh, okay.  Why didn't you do that?  All right.  Thank you, Juggs.  We really don't have time for you.  He's not even good at, like, ragging us.  Bye.  I don't mind if they're good.  Bye.  Christina.  Yeah.  How are you?  I'm fine, thank you.  I'm very excited because I am now a true member of the Tuesday.  Actually, it was a Tuesday afternoon Hummer that I gave today.  Oh.  That was, right?  So you gave your guy a Hummer just because of our radio show?  Yeah.  Well, you know, I think it had to do with a lot of things.  But, yeah, definitely a radio show. 
[00:40:00]  And he got his new apartment.  He was doing manual labor all day.  He came home all dirty and looking like a real construction worker.  And so he was tired and he's got to go in there again today.  And he's actually there now.  He's probably listening.  And so I hooked him up.  Oh, nice.  Yeah, I was very proud.  And then I just got in the car and started listening to you guys.  And I realized it fell on Tuesday.  That's right.  You guys are now members of the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  Did he reciprocate?  Well, yeah.  He actually finished me up.  So it was actually pretty good.  Well, congratulations.  Thank you, guys. 
[00:40:30]  All right.  You suck.  All right, bye.  No, you suck.  Yeah, really.  Ah, Steve.  Hey, Steve.  Yeah.  You're a screenwriter?  Yeah.  How are you, guys?  Pretty good.  I mean, I can't believe how cold it is here.  I can't believe you guys put up with this all winter?  My God.  What, are you from L.A. or something?  Well, yeah, I'm just here for the week, yeah.  Oh, doing some work, are you?  Yeah, this is unbearable.  Yeah, I don't know if I'm going to classify as a celebrity, 
[00:41:00]  but I wrote Saving Private Ryan with Steven Spielberg.  So if that kind of qualifies me, then I want to throw my hat in the ring,  because I listened to you guys last week, and I've heard some of the tapes.  Some of my friends record your tapes and send them out to me in California.  Oh, yeah?  And the bit that you guys did when you sent the homeless to the mall in New Jersey,  I want to tell you, we played it at a party on a Friday night,  and, I mean, they were wet pants. 
[00:41:30]  Guys, it was hysterical.  I mean, well, very funny.  We've got nobody in L.A. doing anything like you.  I mean, they play Stern, and they've got a couple of jocks that step out,  but nobody's doing anything as funny and creative as you guys are.  Well, thank you.  Hopefully we'll be out in L.A.  Isn't Tom Likas the star of L.A.?  Yeah, you know.  Tom!  Tom!  Likas is all right.  Hello, Tom!  Hello, douchebag!  Likas is the same schtick every night. 
[00:42:00]  Yeah.  We'll get out there eventually.  You know, he rips women, and he talks sex, but he's not as creative as you guys are.  The bit with the mall was terrific.  You guys should have a whole team of homeless with O.A. shirts walking around the city.  Yeah.  Well, you know what we're going to do next with the homeless people?  I think we're going to do it soon, actually.  We're going to send a bunch of homeless people to Atlantic City to gamble.  There you go.  Yeah, put them in the casinos. 
[00:42:30]  You know, you probably have casino hosts meeting them at the door with prizes and packages not to come in.  It could be the best thing that ever happened.  Very good.  You know, but you guys suck.  I really enjoyed listening to you.  So how can we prove that you actually wrote Saving Private Ryan?  Ah.  Screenwriter, huh?  What can I tell you?  So what did you sit down with Spielberg and, like, had a story, and what did you do?  Well, well, um...  What was your contribution? 
[00:43:00]  We've worked before, and actually what happened was I was walking through a graveyard in Massachusetts  where my wife is from with my son, and we were...  There was a memorial there to the men from the town that had died on D-Day, and that was kind  of the germ for the idea, and I was trying to explain to him what D-Day was and what World  War II was, and realized that, you know, he was over 12 years old and really didn't have  a clue.  Huh.  Um, and, uh, that was the germ for the idea, and then, uh, about a week later, I was up 
[00:43:30]  one night late, uh, had some bad tacos, and I was, I watched a movie called The Fighting  Sullivan Brothers, um, which was a true story about four American brothers that were killed  on a ship, uh, at the beginning of World War II, and, uh, that, you know, the whole thing  just started germinating, and, uh, sketched it out, and, uh, pitched it to Steven, and,  uh, he was pretty excited.  Hey, Steve, are you...  It sounds legit.  Are you calling from a rubber room?  From a where? 
[00:44:00]  Like a mental hospital.  Imagine if he's just like a lunatic that goes, I wrote that, I swear.  Well...  I guess we gotta believe ya.  Yeah.  What's your last name?  Zalien.  Zalien?  K-L-L-I-A-N.  Uh, I...  On my home planet, it's pronounced.  No, I'll come out with you.  My driver's about to...  Yeah, we're losing ya.  ...on a soft phone.  All right.  Good luck.  You guys suck.  I've really enjoyed listening to you.  Hey, thanks, man.  Say hi to Steven Spielberg.  Uh, for us, all right? 
[00:44:30]  There he goes, Steve.  I guess, uh, Rick's getting on the net, the web, and he's gonna check the credits and see  if he's actually a screenwriter on that.  Now, that's a good start to the, to the, uh, the bit today, Anthony.  It sounded knowledgeable.  That's a mover and shaker, a player in, uh, Hollywood.  Look at that.  Most famous person to...  That is listening to our radio show today.  Yeah.  So far, a screenwriter that, uh, helped, uh, write, uh, Saban Private Ryan.  Yeah.  I think we'll beat that today, Ann.  I don't know.  I'm seeing a couple more on the screen.  All right. 
[00:45:00]  Uh, well, first, let's go to Liz.  Liz, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  How you doing?  Good.  Uh, just wanted to let you know, I'm not the first...  Well, I'm not the first time I initiated my...  Initiated my fiancé in the Hummer Club.  Uh-huh.  Well, we tuned into your station and you started talking about it.  I'm like, oh, wow.  So, what did I do?  I gave him a Hummer.  He was, you know, reciprocated.  And guess what he's doing right now?  Sleeping on the couch.  I'm so pissed off.  Well, why are you pissed off?  That's what happens after we have sex.  Because we just moved into a new house.  There's so much to do.  If I would have known I was going to fire him out, I would have waited until the night. 
[00:45:30]  Well, you should be, uh, flattered.  That means you did a great job.  Yeah, two minutes.  But you really, uh, gave him a Hummer because you heard us talking about it on the show today?  Yeah, well, we were listening to you.  We had the radio on upstairs and downstairs.  Yeah.  And, uh, you gave me the ping pong table.  No, not at all.  We love clapping.  We love hearing about ladies giving Hummers.  Oh, yeah.  And we were fixing the kitchen countertop.  And all of a sudden, you started actually telling that girl how to do it.  Yeah.  And I didn't need any instructions or anything.  But, uh, I happened to be on my knees right in front of them.  So, pulled it out, started doing it. 
[00:46:00]  He stopped me, reciprocated, and I finished him, and now he's sleeping on the couch.  Did you make the Charles Bronson face?  Uh, actually, you made me start laughing when you said to do that face.  And then I looked up at him, and at that same time, you were telling the girl to look up at him with her eyes.  Yeah.  Pretty funny.  But also, watch out for that guy, Joey, that crawled about Penny Crone.  Yeah.  He sounds like a psycho, man.  Well, we have plenty of those that listen to our show.  We're not too worried.  All righty.  Have a nice day, guys.  Thank you, Liz.  All right.  Bye-bye.  I wonder how many, uh, how many Hummers we're getting, guys, today, Anthony. 
[00:46:30]  There seems to be a discrepancy, Opie.  Uh-oh.  And this guy, uh, Stephen, uh, Zalian.  Okay.  A little discrepancy here.  He's under the credits of writing Schindler's List, and not under the credits of writing Saving Private Ryan.  Uh-oh.  Uh-oh.  Well, have we been scammed?  I think Stephen has, uh, Stephen has his fax wrong.  How'd you find that out so fast? 
[00:47:00]  I am on the net.  Internet movie, uh, database.  That's everything you'd ever want to know about any movie.  So we're still looking for famous people listening to our show today?  Yes.  Vincent, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right, what's up?  Hey, listen, I bumped into my ex-wife over Christmas.  Yeah.  And, uh, I haven't seen her in, like, three years.  I'm going out with the chick, you know, having a grand old time with her, but she's not really into the Hummer thing.  So, uh, we started talking on the phone occasionally here and there, and I started telling her about the Hummer Club. 
[00:47:30]  She said, why don't you come by next Tuesday, and I'll get you into the club.  I was like, you gotta be kidding me.  So now, tonight is the night.  We already got the date, we got the hotel room, everything's ready to rock and roll, man.  I'm pretty stupid about this.  I don't know.  Is that sick or what?  That's, uh, yeah, that's a little different.  I figured any way to get in, I might as well take it.  Right.  She was pretty good that way.  It's just everything else was no good, you know?  So you're getting a Hummer because of our radio show.  Absolutely.  Well, let us know how it is, all right?  All right.  You guys rock, man.  Thank you, Vincent.  Take care.  Bye. 
[00:48:00]  Hey, Pam, you're next on WNAW.  What's up?  Hey, what's up?  I want to give my boy, if we're driving, to Housewives Parkway, and I want to give him  up and we're on the radio.  You do?  Hey, hey, turn on your radio.  Turn on the radio.  Do you want, you want to do the trick?  I'm on the cell phone, though.  He's driving, though.  You're on the cell phone?  Uh-huh.  All right, Pam, do me a favor, right?  Yeah.  And don't repeat this.  Just make believe you're talking to us, okay?  Yep.  Start the deed, okay?  All right.  And you give the cell phone to your guy. 
[00:48:30]  We're going to talk to him for, like, just a few, you know, a few seconds.  And while we're talking to him live on the radio, just gently bite his junk, all right?  Bite it?  Ah, forget it, you stupid idiot.  You're not supposed to blurt it out while he's standing right there.  I would never do that.  I don't care.  I know.  All right.  Well.  All right.  No, I hear it.  Yeah, guys.  What a dumb broad.  What a dumb broad.  What do we say? 
[00:49:00]  Don't repeat what I'm saying.  Just, you know, make believe you're talking to me.  Oh, that's, of course.  What did you expect?  We want you just to kind of, you know, bite it a little bit.  Bite it?  Bite it?  Bite it?  God.  Oh, what a dope.  I'm just hoping it is.  Jesus Christ.  Works like a charm.  You can only break out that trick every once in a while, though.  Yeah.  All right, Ant.  We've got to take a break.  We've had a request for the Alan Funt bit.  Ah, yes. 
[00:49:30]  We could do that going into spots.  Sure.  This came in the day that we found out that the founder of Candid Camera.  Alan Funt.  Passed away.  Alan Funt.  It's a very, very sad day.  We lost a great one.  An icon.  An icon.  Television icon.  Television icon.  They're saying there wouldn't have been a cop or a world's dangerous animals.  Oh, really?  If there wasn't first Alan Funt and Candid Camera, Anthony.  Ah, yeah.  Remember that?  I used to watch it all the time.  Alan Funt dead at the age of 84. 
[00:50:00]  Do you have any of his music?  Yeah.  Oh, yeah.  You're elected.  You're the star today.  Smile.  You're on David.  Yeah.  That's right.  I remember that.  Look at that.  I'm tearing up.  We took our candid camera and put it here in a casket where my corpse will be rotting.  Don't be surprised if sometimes, somewhere, 
[00:50:30]  someone steps up to you and says,  Hey, Alan, you're dead.  That's so wrong.  What?  He'd probably like that.  They should do, like, a final candid camera stunt with him.  With Alan Funt in the casket?  Here I am in a casket, in a funeral parlor.  But that isn't a funeral director.  It's actually Fanny Flann, playing the bumbling funeral director.  Watch the horror of my grieving family as she knocks the casket over. 
[00:51:00]  And embalming fluid pours out of my ass.  Oh, look at that.  See?  It just splashed Fanny in the face.  Here I am, after a few days of rotting.  They put me out of the street against a lamppost like a bum.  Look at the horror of the people passing by as they smell the stench of rotting death. 
[00:51:30]  That woman just fell down.  Isn't that funny?  Hey, the cop on the corner is played by Maury Amsterdam.  After a week, my limbs are falling off.  Watch as someone drives their car around the block with my legs sticking out the bottom of the car door. 
[00:52:00]  I'm dead.  I was pretty fat toward the end.  I had an Alan Funt bunt.  He was always getting in on the act.  Now, in addition to candid kids,  watch in horror as my head is on a table of kindergarten class.  The kids screaming in horror. 
[00:52:30]  Oh, an extra treat.  A bird's pecking out my eyeball.  Look at the screaming in horror in the children.  Well, Anthony, that's not the way I want to remember Alan Funt.  Well, I think you would like to be involved in one last stunt like that.  One last Kenny Cameron stunt?  One last candid camera.  Come on.  What's Fanny Flagg?  Who's the funeral director?  Watch as they put me in a gay bar as a passed-out gay man, and I take it in the keister. 
[00:53:00]  Come on.  You want to tune in?  What is it, Weekend at Bernie's with Alan Funt starring?  Weekend at Alan's.  Come on.  Here we are in a bowling alley.  Watch the horror of the bowler as their ball knocks the pins down,  but my head comes back and the ball returns.  Oops, watch my eyes. 
[00:53:30]  Come on, you wouldn't watch.  Oh, I remember this.  Al, what's up?  Yeah, he made a couple of X-rated candy cameras.  Yeah, he made it.  It was a video store.  What was that?  It was on Playboy Channel or something.  Unless there was other ones that people forgot about where I administered the jackhammer to certain people.  Watch as Fanny Flagg is bent over a table as I pound her with the jackhammer. 
[00:54:00]  In this next clip, people pass by an ordinary lobby of a dental office  as Adrian Barbeau gives Jimmy Stewart a rusty trombone.  Look at the horror.  Don't be surprised if sometime, somewhere, someone steps up to you and says,  Hey, bitch, cover your gash. 
[00:54:30]  Watch the fun as this crack whore dies swallowing her own vomit.  Laugh along with Fanny Flagg and Maury Amsterdam.  Well, there he goes.  Godspeed, Alan.  Godspeed.  Alan Funt dead at the age of 84.  Yeah.  Our haunting tribute.  Don't be surprised if sometime, somewhere, someone steps up to you and says,  Hey, Alan, you're dead. 
[00:55:00]  1027-WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  That's a taped bit, obviously.  We wanted to play the Alan Funt before commercials.  But we've got to go back live on the radio because Psycho Mark has struck again, man.  Psycho Mark live on the air with us from Times Square outside the MTV studios.  And, Mark, you were completely on with the wow sign.  We should be back on right about now.  See if you can see it.  All right.  Here we go.  We're live.  All right.  They're fading out. 
[00:55:30]  There you are right there.  There he is.  He's right behind Carson in the crosswalk.  Move over.  Yeah, right there.  Now you're behind the guy.  Whoa, you almost got hit by a truck.  Oh, they went to the street now.  They went to the middle by the car.  Hey, they're on the street right now.  They're on the street right now.  All right, wait.  Now they're back.  Oh, they keep flipping back and forth.  Well, the cameraman inside the studio, he keeps looking at me.  He keeps moving, panning over to the right.  That's all right.  Well, they're right there.  All right, hold on.  They're on the street.  They're talking.  They're doing a little interview.  Psycho Mark has struck again today. 
[00:56:00]  On Total Request Live there.  Total Request Live.  He should be on again.  A huge wow banner.  Okay, they're back.  There you are.  There you are.  Look at him.  Oh, my God.  Moving up and down.  Up and down.  Up and down.  Moving up and down, Mark.  There he is.  And people are peeping.  There's the wow sign.  You can't get behind the guy on the street?  Yeah, lift it up.  Lift it up.  We're on again.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  Oh, okay. 
[00:56:30]  Lift it up.  Uh-oh.  There he goes.  There he goes.  There he goes.  Psycho Mark and his wow sign.  They're trying to move the camera.  Go to your right really fast.  Yeah, go to your right.  Oh, we see the cop.  We see the cop.  Go to your right.  Go to your right.  Go to your right.  There it is.  Right there.  Perfect.  Perfect.  He has struck again.  Hey, man.  That was so funny.  What?  Hey.  See?  That is the...  Psycho Mark has struck again outside the MTV studio. 
[00:57:00]  Hey, they were successful.  They're all looking at me up inside the studio right now.  They were trying to figure a plan where they could get a better camera out of it without  me in it.  But you know what?  What?  That's impossible.  They keep panning the camera around you.  Mark, hold on the line.  A couple people saw you.  Hold on.  All right.  Hold on a sec.  Let me do it.  Let me do it this way.  Mike, what's going on?  What's up, guys? 
[00:57:30]  Hey, what's up?  Yeah, I called up and I told him that I saw him on MTV and Spatz took all the credit.  He said it was his sign.  I was watching Total Request Live.  I mean, I don't like the show, but I just saw the wow sign in the corner.  I was like, oh, there's a wow sign.  This is the total guy.  Yeah, it's way in the background.  That's what's so funny.  I was watching it while you were...  Yeah, don't curse, though.  Thank you, man.  Oh, sorry, man.  All right, Mike.  All right, bye.  Bye.  Is that too funny?  You just like standing in the background.  All right.  Let me go to Jose real fast. 
[00:58:00]  Jose, what's up?  Yeah, I'm watching it right now.  It looks like Psycho Mark's like a midget on a Viagra right now.  Jumping up and down.  It's not as pronounced as the Letterman studio thing from last week, but it's just as funny  because you can read the wow clear as day in the background.  Yeah.  All right.  All right, Jose.  Thank you.  Good room.  All right, bye.  Hey, you know what's really funny?  Huh?  The channel, too, is down here doing some live reports out here. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah?  And I might have a chance to do some again.  Oh, my God.  What are they doing down there?  Well, hey, Channel 2?  I have one of the views.  Channel 7's down here.  Channel 2.  Yeah.  I don't know.  Some of these are probably down here.  All right.  Hold on a second.  I want to go to another caller here.  Eric, what's going on?  Hey, how are you doing?  All right.  I saw Psycho Mark down there.  I just caught MTV, the last of it.  Yeah.  That cop car turned around.  I thought they were going to get out and arrest him.  You see?  I know.  What was going on with that cop car, Mark? 
[00:59:00]  Those guys started tuning in to ANW.  As soon as they saw me, they reached for their radio, and they started tuning in.  They gave them a thumbs up.  Yeah.  Hey, Mark.  I love the cops, man.  Ask Mark if he would expect you guys to post sale form.  Nah, he's not going to get in trouble.  Nah, I'm not.  As long as it's not over, like, $25, $30.  Mark, it was funny, because the first time you were on, you were, like, the only guy in  the street with a big, huge wow sign.  The sole idiot running around with a big, yellow sign.  Well, I think MTV gave me a tour in their studios about three months ago, so I figured 
[00:59:30]  I'm on their camera angle.  Oh, cool.  So I just want to get the back door here.  Eric?  Hey, guys, I was watching Raw last night.  I saw a sign for a rusty trombone.  Oh, cool.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  You guys take care.  All right, man.  You guys rock.  Bye.  All right.  What's going on with the police cars?  Oh, there's a fire engine just coming down the street.  Hold on.  I think they're about to do another shoot, and if I'm lucky, I'll be able to be on. 
[01:00:00]  All right.  You can't get near that guy on the street, huh?  What's that?  You can't get near the guy on the street?  I can, but there's, like, a bunch of S-beaters around them.  Yeah.  And, uh, I mean, I suppose I could.  Can't you go for, like, the suicide mission and just run right in front of the camera with  the big, huge wow sign or what?  Yeah, it's off to eye.  I mean, just start making a lot of noise.  Hey, rip them out!  You know.  That's playing, too.  Are they showing a song right now?  They're in commercial.  They're in commercial.  Joe, what's up?  What's up, man? 
[01:00:30]  He looked like a computer animation.  Yeah, it did.  It looked like it was inserted in.  That was classic.  Oh, cool, Joe.  Thanks.  Yeah.  What I want to do is I want to go whip out stupid signs from all these stupid chicks  hanging out in front here.  Psycho Mark, you look like, like, where's Waldo?  All of a sudden, out of nowhere, you see, yeah, you see the huge wow sign.  Right.  It's like searcher guy.  Right.  All right, Joe.  Thank you.  Bye.  That is too friggin' funny, man.  Eric, you're next.  What's going on?  Oh, I got it on tape. 
[01:01:00]  Oh, you did?  Yeah.  We were taping it, right?  You see, who was that guy?  Freddie Prinze or whoever?  I think that Freddie Prinze Jr. is a film in tonight.  Yeah, you see that talking, right?  They cut off the screen.  All you see is that was Mark Holden, the big yellow and red banner, running backwards like  he's going to fall, looking back, and he almost got sideswiped by the jar.  You saw that, huh?  It's hysterical.  Oh, he's a lunatic.  Oh, dude, I'm getting set up for the second shot here.  All right.  I guarantee you I'm going to get on this time again.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Eric.  I've got to hang out because we want to see what Mark does here. 
[01:01:30]  Okay, I'm dropping it in the mail now.  All right, man.  Yeah, get the tape to us.  Okay.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Mark, they should be going to you very, very soon here.  Very soon.  All right.  Let me know how I'm doing with angles.  I will.  If you could get in front of the camera on the street and just make a complete jackass of yourself,  we'd be greatly appreciative.  All right.  All right.  I'm going to stand there and I don't worry.  I'm standing across the street.  Cops telling me to stand across the street, fat pig.  You guys there? 
[01:02:00]  Yeah, we're here.  All right.  I'm definitely going to get on this time, no matter what.  If I had the block truck, I'd get killed.  All right.  Here we go.  I think now he's not on yet.  All right.  All right.  Hang up because we've got to go to Psycho Mark.  Okay.  No problem.  All right, man.  Yeah, they're still in commercials, bro.  Are they?  Yeah.  Not so long.  All right.  Brian, what's going on?  Oh, my God.  That's the hugest wow sign I've ever seen in my life.  Isn't that a big one?  Oh, my bad.  Don't care.  Yeah, but the wow sign. 
[01:02:30]  Oh, my God.  All right, Brian.  Brian, thanks.  We're going live again.  We've got to go.  I'm standing across the street right now.  All right.  That's our building.  All right.  They're on the street.  We're looking.  We're looking.  We're waving.  We don't see anything yet.  There's a tractor trailer going in front of the studio.  I should be on about now, guys.  You seen me right across the street?  They moved them in front.  Oh, wait.  Lift it up.  Lift it up.  Lift it all the way up.  That's high.  Move to your right.  Move to your...  Oh.  They keep...  All right. 
[01:03:00]  But you're on again.  No, no.  You're behind them.  Move to your right.  Move to your right.  Or way over to your left.  Way over to your left.  Move way left.  Way left.  Run left.  Run left.  Run left.  Run left.  Run left.  As hard as you can.  I'm serious.  Run, run, run.  Oh.  God damn.  We could tell it was the wild side.  You were almost there.  You were almost there.  You were like...  The W and half the O, man. 
[01:03:30]  I'm sorry.  It's tough because they keep trying to move the camera around.  Yeah, they're screwing around with the camera.  They're completely onto you because they keep going to different camera angles.  You just got to torment them.  All right, Chris.  What's going on?  Dude, that is the funniest FTR I've ever seen in my life.  Psycho Mark looks like a little puppet out there.  You're like...  He's crazy.  He's like taking these little steps.  Oh, it's too funny, man.  That's the largest clown sign I've ever seen.  All right.  Thank you, Chris. 
[01:04:00]  If anyone comes up to him, tell him nobody nip-nates with the Psycho Mark.  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Later.  Thank you.  I hope my insurance is tied up because I'm going to get nailed by a car here.  Yeah, you got to be careful because when you're running all over the street,  this car is flying all over the place, man.  Yes, it is.  Let me see.  Let me see what else we got here.  There's a ton of people calling in.  Sean, what's going on?  Yo, nonstop recording for you guys.  Oh, cool.  I've got it all.  We're still looking for Psycho Mark's Letterman CBS TV appearance from last week. 
[01:04:30]  Someone's got to send that in to us so we can put it on the unofficial website.  I didn't get that one.  Yo, tell the cops to, like, screw themselves.  All right.  Yeah, that's all right.  Most of them are being cool.  All right.  You guys want the tape?  Yeah, definitely.  All right.  Thanks, Sean.  Bye.  Stand by.  All right.  They're going up again.  All right.  It was going up again.  This is too funny.  All right.  They're live again.  All right.  Where are you, Mark?  Where are you?  There you are.  Stay right there.  Stay right there. 
[01:05:00]  Hold it up straight.  I'm going to go in the next time.  Lay it in.  You're a lunatic.  Go right.  Go right.  That's okay.  That's okay.  He was off for, like, 15 seconds.  You're a freaking loon, man.  All the way right.  You're back on.  All the way right.  Run is far.  Oh, it's all right.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  That's true.  It's all right.  It's all right.  Quick clips.  Oh, my God.  It's too funny, though.  He's jumping around. 
[01:05:30]  He's waving the sign around.  It does.  It looks like it's been inserted in digitally or something.  Hey, Rich.  What's up?  All right.  They're on again.  Move to the right.  I can't.  I'm stuck behind a bus.  Are you?  Yeah, no.  I'm screwed right now.  Oh, there's the bus.  We see the bus.  Yeah.  That's okay.  Hey, Rich.  What's going on?  Hey, guys.  This is incredible, man.  You guys are too funny.  I'm sitting here.  I've got MTV on.  The stereo on.  It's like total interactive.  Yeah.  I mean, the psycho Mark is a nutcase.  He is in every shot that they go to, man. 
[01:06:00]  You guys rock.  This is too funny.  I'm in the chair right now.  I'm in the chair.  All right, Rich.  Thank you.  Take care, guys.  This is our new bit.  Interactive TV, man.  A lot of instant feedback is coming in.  The sign is as big as Mark, and he's jumping in the street like a fish out of water.  Mark looks like a Smurf on crack running around with that sign.  That's funny.  Oh, my God.  This is really funny.  What's your department?  Tom, what's going on? 
[01:06:30]  Tom.  I can barely hear him because of the...  Yeah.  Brian from Flushing, he goes, I'm screaming at the freaking TV.  Move right.  Move left.  The people are screaming at home.  Hey, Mark, no one's messing with you at all?  No one's messing with me at all.  I mean, again, this is America.  It is a sidewalk, and I get locked out of it.  And I'm outside of my tubes to do so.  If I did, hey, I should go and head over to Fox and see if I can do two in one day. 
[01:07:00]  That's not a bad idea.  Go over to the Fox News channel and give them the goose, too.  Oh, yeah, because they have those windows now, don't they?  Yeah, but you've got to do it.  You've got to get the timing just right for them.  Yeah.  So if you could get by there, by their windows where they do their broadcast, and then get  on the cell phone with us, we'll monitor it.  And right when they go to that shot, you could just jump out and make a buffoon of yourself  with that.  Well, I'm going to stay here for a little bit because I'm having so much fun with MTV.  They're about to shoot me at the window.  All right. 
[01:07:30]  John, you're on the radio.  What's up?  Hey, guys.  What's going on?  I just had to be home down the parkway, and I just put on MTV.  Dude, I am.  It's in my pants.  He's like a crazy monkey, man.  That's why we call him Psycho Mark.  He has struck again.  He is the best.  Two in two weeks, man.  We found you, Mark.  We found you.  Take care, guys.  Good job.  Bye.  Bye.  Are they going back to you or what?  I don't know.  I'm sort of watching.  I think they're in the middle of a video right now, as far as I can see. 
[01:08:00]  But I'm trying to get another angle.  They keep moving all the whole set around, and they keep trying to shift stuff.  But I'm too smart for that.  We ought to get a girl to wow.  I know.  I mean, imagine that real live boobs on MTV like that.  Any girls in the area?  Yeah.  We should get some chicks down here.  Man, I mean, even if they wow from your distance, it would be hilarious.  It's still boobage.  Yes. 
[01:08:30]  Let me see what Sal has to say.  Sal, what's going on?  Yo, what's up?  All right.  Oh, I saw Psycho Mark on MTV, man.  I'm crying.  This guy is so funny.  It's cool.  I see this little blue guy jumping around with a wow sign.  It's hilarious.  That wow sign is huge.  It is huge.  Oh, it's crazy.  All right, man.  Keep it up, guys.  Thank you, Sal.  I'm stuck.  All right.  Everyone's saying we've got to kill the delay.  Yeah.  That is a problem, but I don't know if it's going to happen, though.  Mark, you still there? 
[01:09:00]  Yeah, I'm trying to get set up for the next shot.  The cameraman is kneeling down right now.  He's not getting an angle of the street anymore because I'm kind of penalizing the neighborhood.  I'm doing, like, high-angle shots right now of him from underneath, so I just...  Well, we're in affection the way they're directing the show.  I'm wondering if the cameraman up there is a...  Hi, Carson.  I'm like, hi, hi, it's me.  Carson, we're going to go with the up-the-nostril shot on this one. 
[01:09:30]  Hey, John, what's up?  Hey, John, what's up?  What's going on, O'Brien?  All right.  I saw Mark on MTV.  Yeah.  He looks like a lunatic jumping around.  He's all blue.  That's our man, Mark.  You know, MTV's screwed.  They repeat that thing at 9 o'clock.  Yeah.  So whoever didn't see it and, you know, the delay, whoever catches the delay.  Yeah, we'll see it.  They'll tape it.  I wonder if they're going to have to, like...  Cube him out or something.  Cube out the wow later or something.  All right, John.  All right, see you later. 
[01:10:00]  Bye.  All right, Mark.  I think they're going to go to you any second here.  Hold on.  What is that he's trying to say?  Eddie.  Yes.  What's up?  Go to 59th and 5th cycle at 5 o'clock.  They're going to do the 5 o'clock newscast at the early show studio.  Really?  Yes.  You hear that, Mark?  They switched to studios now because they're losing money.  59th and 5th today?  59th and 5th.  They're doing the 5 o'clock news?  The same block as F.A.O. Shorts on the other side? 
[01:10:30]  Are you sure they're doing it from there or not?  Positive.  100% positive.  All right.  Nobody's in front of those windows.  All right.  All right?  Thank you, Eddie.  All right.  Bye.  All right.  They're back on, dude.  I'm, like, behind them a little bit.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we are.  We're back live.  Look at a shot.  The guy.  Where are you?  Right here, man.  I'm right there.  Shake the sign.  There you are.  There you are.  There you are.  Move to your right a little bit.  Like a step to your right.  Man, look at him shaking around and stuff. 
[01:11:00]  Watch out for that truck, man.  Dude, run to the left real fast.  Run to the left.  Run, run.  Oh, no.  Cars are coming.  He's in the middle of traffic now.  He's in the middle of the street.  Hey, watch out for the cars.  What a friggin' lunatic.  Look at him.  He is a friggin' lunatic, man.  Oh, damn.  Is that funny, man?  This is too much fun. 
[01:11:30]  Dude, you've got to do one where you just run in the middle of the street to your left,  and it'll be a great shot.  Like you'll be alone in the picture.  You'll be alone in the picture.  I'll be right in the middle of the street, and I'll be dead.  Oh, my God.  You'll be off the pavement.  Wow.  Hold on a second.  Someone wants to talk to you.  Pete, what's going on?  Hey, what's up?  All right.  My girlfriend works for MTV.  If I can get in touch with her, she might be able to go out there and wow. 
[01:12:00]  Oh, really?  Yeah.  We really need a girl.  If there's any girls near Psycho Mark, we want you to flash.  No worries.  I might be able to get her out there.  All right.  Well, do it immediately.  I'll try it.  I'll call you guys back.  All right.  All right.  All right.  Thanks.  We've got a bunch of fans down here.  We're going for you, Anthony.  Well, you got it.  Are you going, sir?  I'll be there, sir.  Don't get one of them to wow us, man.  Is there any...  Hey, you guys.  Hey, you guys throwing chips around in those nice huge cans? 
[01:12:30]  Oh, wait.  There's a sergeant on the line that just got a complaint from MTV.  Sergeant Morales, what's up?  Hey, how's it going, man?  I'm coming down to take him down now.  You guys got to get him out of there.  Come on.  No.  All right.  Baba Booey, Baba Booey.  Oh, what am I wrong with you?  I'm not even going to dump out of the line.  Say Baba Booey as much as you want.  That old gag.  That old gag.  Ryan from Jersey on the Instant Feedback.  I guess he's not listening.  It says on MTV's Total Request Live right now, there's a crazy guy dancing with a huge wow sign.  They didn't say that, did they? 
[01:13:00]  Yeah.  A crazy guy.  That's you.  I thought it was psycho.  Bobby, what's up?  Yo, guys, I was just watching Total Request Live.  I saw the thing on there.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I mean, it's all right, but what really would be good, what would be much cooler, is if you  actually get a girl to wow on the air.  Yeah, that's what we're going to try to do.  Yeah, that's what you should do.  And, you know, it's really tough when you guys talk about it with the delay and all that.  Yeah, we know.  It's still funny as hell, man. 
[01:13:30]  That's what you should get.  All right.  All right, Bobby.  All right.  All right.  Thank you, Bobby.  There's always someone trying to wreck our buzz, man.  It's still funny as hell.  Hey, Mark.  Yeah.  They're in a long commercial break now, I think.  Oh, they are?  Yeah.  I would hope so.  They're probably so sick of me that they don't want to get back around forever.  Is anyone saying anything to you?  One cop, I was in the Middle Island.  One cop said one thing, and that was it.  Yeah.  But other than that, no one has even said a word.  Every cop that drives by has been giving me the thumbs up. 
[01:14:00]  They're like, hey, little bird.  Is there any girl close by that could do a quick wow?  There's not about 12 teeny boppers in front of me, but...  No, we don't.  If there's any Opie and Anthony fans really close to Psycho Mark outside the MTV studios,  you've got to find Mark with a huge wow sign.  Got to.  You can't miss me.  Well, that's obvious.  Quick flash.  That would be great.  Let's go to...  Someone says Mark looks like the old video game Frogger in the middle of the street. 
[01:14:30]  Remember that game?  Yeah, because you're moving all over the place trying not to get hit by the trucks.  I do.  I was at the mail about 12 times.  Hey, Chris, what's up?  I thought yesterday was funny with CBS, but you guys beat yourselves out today.  Yeah, this is hilarious, man.  I used to like the show.  Now I have to listen to it or my day's not complete.  Oh, thank you, man.  You guys are hilarious.  The CBS bit is the funniest thing the radio has ever produced.  Hey, look at that.  Hey, thank you.  You got it.  All right.  I think they're going back live.  All right.  We'll find out in a second here. 
[01:15:00]  Trying to get in position here for this camera shot.  Someone's saying they finally have a reason to watch MTV since they were 13.  Oh, man.  He's going to get hit by that frigging bus.  Yeah, watch out for the trucks and the buses, Mark.  Dude, I'm going to get nailed.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  Are they going back?  I don't know.  I think they're showing up.  All right.  Yeah, they're coming back right now.  All right.  They're doing a loud shot.  They got that chick.  All right.  Here we go.  Come on.  Come on. 
[01:15:30]  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  Just eagerly awaiting.  Just waiting for the cue from the director inside.  And we should be going.  Psycho Mark has struck again today.  We told you we'd strike again soon.  What?  All right.  There's some long freaking promo.  Christina Aguilera thing.  All right.  Here we go.  Here we go.  They're coming back.  TRL.  The live shot.  They're showing the crowd.  There's the street.  They're going back to the jock any second.  Now, listen to what we say, Mark. 
[01:16:00]  The truck is going to go in front of me.  But after the truck, I should be on the other side.  All right.  All right.  There's the truck.  Wait.  Wait.  Wait.  Oh, that damn truck.  Wait.  Wait.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on.  There you are.  There you are.  There you go.  What a lunatic.  Move to your right.  Move to your right.  Move to your right.  To your right.  To your right.  To your right.  To your right.  Move to your right.  There you go.  Dude, you're going to get hit by a car.  Watch out.  There goes the ambulance.  That ambulance almost hit him. 
[01:16:30]  Right in the middle of the street.  I know.  All right.  That's fine.  Yeah, we can't have him get run over.  I can't believe it.  He's just right there.  That's great.  There's the huge wow side.  Now he's walking into the street.  If you could move into the street, it would be really, it would be perfect.  Oh, my God.  There's a long, long shot.  And you're right in the middle of the street, man.  There you go.  Dude, watch out for the trucks.  They're flying right by you.  All right.  I'm good.  I'm good.  All right.  I'm good.  I'm good.  All right.  Get ready to run in the middle of the street if you can. 
[01:17:00]  Go.  Go.  Now.  No.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  Go.  He can't run into the middle of the street.  There he goes.  There he goes.  He's crossing the street.  Yeah, and they quickly cut away.  They're all laughing at you out there, man.  The people who are laughing at me are killing me out.  They're like, go, take them out.  Come, take them out.  Come, take them out. 
[01:17:30]  Yeah, we need a girl to get over there in front of the MTV studio.  Yeah.  Well, we got Jay on the phone.  Jay, what's up?  Yo, what's going on?  How are they?  All right.  We are congealing bastards.  What's up?  Not much.  We're having fun today.  Yo, my girl's out there, dog.  Well, get her to Psycho Mark.  Yeah, sure.  Nah, he just hung up.  All right.  Yeah, whatever.  Yeah, my girl's out there.  Diana, what's going on?  I'm fearing that I'm going to see a clip of this on Fox's next one, Good Times Go Bad. 
[01:18:00]  He's going to get nailed by a taxi.  How scary is that when you see the trucks?  I'm scared for him.  Yeah, because the sign is so big and he's just running forward.  He doesn't even realize he's running in the middle of traffic and stuff.  When Good Times Go Bad.  You're going to see it.  I'm telling you.  All right, Diana.  Unbelievable.  You guys are the best.  All right, thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Psycho Mark striking again today for the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Yeah.  What is the instant feedback saying?  People loving it.  Think it's hysterical.  They're watching it at home and listening to the radio.  Truly interactive.  We've taken radio to a new level. 
[01:18:30]  It's like a big, stupid video game, isn't it?  It really is.  It's Frogger with Psycho Mark.  Hey, Sean, what's up?  Sean.  I'm on one.  Huh?  Yeah, what's up, Sean?  Who's this?  Yeah, real fast, Sean.  Yeah, I thought Psycho Mark was an idiot.  All right.  Yeah.  All right, hold on, hold on.  Mark.  Yeah, what's that guy?  Who's talking to you?  Some guys here on the street.  They're telling me I should go up to 59.  All right.  What was the street again that's broadcasting live from?  59th and 5th.  Is that really true? 
[01:19:00]  59th and 5th.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I'll go up there.  I mean, you know me.  I can tell that.  All right.  But I don't know.  I'm not done with MTV yet.  I still want to have more fun.  When is this TRL over?  5th?  They go all the way to 5th?  All right.  They're back on, Mark.  They're back on.  Where are you?  Where are you?  I'm not in the shot.  Hold on.  All right.  You got to move on.  All right.  I saw a piece of them.  They just cut away.  The Rock is on TRL tomorrow.  A lot of people thought we were going to strike tomorrow when The Rock was there.  But today was a surprise attack, Anthony. 
[01:19:30]  I just want to get the street around that.  All right.  All right.  You're back on.  You're back on.  All right.  Hold on.  You got to get in the crosswalk.  All right.  I'm running on the crosswalk now.  All right.  They're moving out.  They're moving out.  No.  All right.  I'm dead.  They're down on the street, and that's the end of the show.  Yeah.  Is it?  Yes.  Mark.  This is tape.  Bravo.  Bravo.  Psycho Mark strikes again, everyone.  Well, then, once again, infiltrating live television. 
[01:20:00]  All right.  Well, I'm going to run over to Fox.  All right.  Because that's the next stop, the 59th and 5th.  59th and 5th.  Get over there immediately.  Try to get some girls over there as well.  That would be great.  Any ladies that want to flash, Mark will be at 59th and 5th with the huge wow sign.  Okay?  All right.  I'll see you guys.  I'll call you guys back.  All right.  Cool.  Peace out.  Psycho Mark, everyone.  Brilliant.  Brilliant.  We've got to get that TV on Fox now.  We'll do that.  We are so late. 
[01:20:30]  We've got to take a break here, man.  We are so late, Ant.  Too funny.  All right.  We'll be playing some commercials.  If anything happens, we'll definitely jump right back into the show.  So stay there.  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  We're back.  It's the Opie and Anthony show.  You never know who's going to stop on by the studio.  On the way, actually, Stephen Lynch, Anthony. 
[01:21:00]  Yes.  We've got Stephen Lynch coming into the studio.  We have Psycho Mark causing havoc all over Midtown.  Live television.  Live television.  And now in the studio, our buddy, our pal, Chuck.  Yes.  What's up, Chuck?  What's up, guys?  How you doing?  All right.  Chuck in a suit.  Decided to come by to hang out with the show today.  Yes.  Sure.  Definitely.  Baby suit.  That's what this is, guys.  Were you checking out Psycho Mark at MTV?  He is a nut.  He's a straight lunatic, man.  You know what's funny, though?  Carson Daly is so self-absorbed.  He probably turned around like, wow, they're really impressed, aren't they? 
[01:21:30]  Yeah, wow.  Maybe they're wowing at my little costume wearing today.  Exactly.  Well, Carson wasn't there today.  It was Freddie Prinze Jr.  Yeah.  They're going to rerun this tonight.  It'll be very interesting to see if they have to, like, chrome out all the wow signs.  No, they probably won't.  You don't think they will?  They'll just let it fly?  People loving it, though.  Andy and Jersey.  Jesus, he almost got hit by that friggin' postal truck.  Did you see that?  That'll be the first time a post office person kills somebody without a gun. 
[01:22:00]  Yeah.  I think the Opie and Anthony show is truly the first radio show to become interactive with TV.  With your TV.  It's great.  And without their knowledge.  Right.  Yeah, that's the most fun.  That's the only fun way to do it.  Kevin and Jersey, is there any way to hook Psycho Mark up to a joystick so we can just move them around that way?  Pick another day and I'll go whip them out for you.  Yeah, we're looking for a girl to join Psycho Mark.  You know what, we've got to let this settle down a little bit because we figured out some things today and we have to have another sneak attack. 
[01:22:30]  All right.  It'll get better next time.  Yeah, the people down there love Psycho Mark.  T-R-L with Psycho Mark.  Total request lunatic.  Hey, Ryan, what's up?  Fellas, how you doing?  All right.  I actually work in that building.  I was just downstairs and it's funny.  This whole group of guys now following around.  He's like a mental patient out there.  He's laughing to himself and giggling and everything.  That's why we call him Psycho Mark.  He's out of his freaking mind.  He'll do anything for this radio show.  Then he rolls up this sign and tries to hide it like he's 007 or something, dodging in and out of traffic to get positioned where the camera starts Carson Daly and then him. 
[01:23:00]  Yeah.  But you guys know you're screwed with your own company again.  I know, because what?  Now we own MTV and Joe, right?  CBS, the Viacom.  Right.  So you guys are in trouble again.  It's going to be everything.  That's why we can't worry about it anymore.  We just got to F with the world and then we'll see what happens.  All right.  Good stuff, Al.  All right.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.  Speaking of our own company.  What? 
[01:23:30]  CBS FM's on our case again today.  Bobby, what's up?  Hey, how you doing?  I was just listening to your CBS thing.  I was dying.  I'm, you know, driving.  Yeah.  So about five minutes ago, I pull into a store and I go in and they have CBS FM on.  And you got that guy that sounds like he smokes 1,800 cigarettes a day telling the news.  Right as he ended that, he starts going like this.  He's like, well, look at the problems we caused today making fun of these guys.  And the other guy, they're like trying to laugh it off and everything.  And the guy, right before he puts a song on, goes, oh, yeah, well, maybe next time somebody  will, we can pick on a station somebody really wants to listen to. 
[01:24:00]  Oh, yeah.  You guys should all call them and remind them who's kicking whose ass in the ratings.  I did already.  Before they start making comments like that.  I told them I was cousin Brucey's nephew.  They still wouldn't let me through.  They're not going to let you through because they don't know how to deal with it.  No.  Of course they don't.  We let people through this radio show all the time that wants to trash us.  Yeah, well, what the hell?  All right.  Yeah, but.  All right, hey, you guys suck.  I'll talk to you later.  All right.  Pretty funny.  If they had any balls whatsoever, they would put some of our listeners on their airwaves 
[01:24:30]  this afternoon.  Yeah.  Ain't going to happen.  They don't know how to handle a situation like that.  No.  They freak out.  Evan, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  I was just channel surfing, too, and they said the same thing.  It was hilarious.  They were saying, oh, we should find somebody else to insult that gets us free publicity.  It doesn't matter.  We're still kicking their ass in the rain.  I was listening to that yesterday.  I almost crashed on the way home.  I was crying.  What do they think?  Like, our listeners, obviously, you know, might check them out or something to see if 
[01:25:00]  they actually do sound like that, which they do.  I don't know.  And then get stuck there and go, oh, I really enjoy this station.  I like hearing 50-year-old music played by 80-year-old men.  Yeah, this is really much better than the O&A show.  This is exactly what I was looking for from my radio.  CBS FM.  We better find someone else to goof on, because we don't know how to deal with the phone calls  we're getting.  Hey, how about we play a moldy oldie and then have a girl shoot a ping pong ball out her 
[01:25:30]  snatch?  Come on, everybody.  Come on.  CBS.  That was hilarious.  You guys are great.  How about we do that?  Today on CBS FM, it's Whip'em on Wednesday.  Show us your cans, bitches.  Yeah.  Ron Lundy, hello, love.  Let me see you shoot a bowling ball out of that gash.  Don't forget to tell the ladies to hob some knob, because it is Tuesday, Anthony.  Yeah, we're going to try to get listeners the same way Opie and Anthony do. 
[01:26:00]  Hey, ladies, it's Hummer Tuesday, Hob Some Knob on CBS FM.  Hob, hob, knob.  To the sounds of the happy organ from 1959, you're Hob and Knob, baby, CBS.  They got to be kidding me.  Oh, please, the echo's going to make my head split open.  CBS, don't goof on Opie and Anthony. 
[01:26:30]  They'll talk about you and how you like to touch children.  Children touchers.  No, we don't know what they're talking about over there.  Whatever.  But if they have any balls whatsoever, put some of our listeners on your little radio show today.  Yeah, it won't happen.  It won't happen.  Your numbers will drastically go up to five.  Yeah, but they keep dropping dead, the listeners.  They've got to recruit them from somewhere. 
[01:27:00]  We're also recruiting new listeners.  Yeah.  Don, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  What's going on?  All right.  How you guys doing?  Are you guys going to the Knick game tomorrow night?  Not tomorrow's game, but in the near future.  Why?  If I work for the Knicks, I want to say what's up to you, fellas.  Maybe you can get an autograph or something.  Oh, cool.  Yeah, I won't be there tomorrow, but we should get Psycho Mark at the Knick game.  Yeah, he should be the guy that runs on the court with a big, huge wow sign that gets tackled.  Better than that, a big, huge...  Like at the college football games, you know, the guy with the banner, and he just runs down the field. 
[01:27:30]  Right.  They just have a big flag, a wow flag, and just watch everybody else.  It'll be like a pig catching race, you know?  You ever see them, they try to catch the pig?  It's my tomorrow night.  Yeah.  All of a sudden, Patrick Ewing, like, tackles Psycho Mark at the middle of the Knick game.  Yeah, but get Mark real greased up first.  Like, like pounding on his head.  He's out there trying to find more trouble, so I don't know.  We'll see where he ends up today.  That's a good idea.  We ought to get, like, Ziggy and all his homeless friends to carry wow signs out front of MTV. 
[01:28:00]  Not a bad idea at all.  All right.  Because we were on, like, for 50 straight minutes with Psycho Mark, we do have to take another quick break.  Steven Lynch should be here soon.  Psycho Mark should be checking in.  We've got Chuck in the studio.  Lots going on on the Opie and Anthony show today.  Sometimes you feel like a mess.  Booty dooty.  Sometimes you don't.  You guys are going to burn in hell.  Opie and Anthony.  Anthony Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner. 
[01:28:30]  Yes, people losing weight.  You know, you're bulked up.  It's the winter.  It's cold.  You've got to get your layer of fat.  But what are you going to do when the weather starts getting warmer, huh?  You going to be a pig when you peel off those clothes?  No.  Stacker 2, world's strongest fat burner.  It burns the fat away.  It's amazing.  Yes, it is.  And it also gives you that boost of energy.  Oh, yeah.  And it cuts the cravings to snack during the day so you're not putting Twinkies in your mouth and stuff and gaining more weight.  And it all adds up to losing that big, fat belly that you accumulated over the winter. 
[01:29:00]  Don't you like to call that area of a woman a bunt?  The bunt.  Ladies, the guys don't like the bunt.  No bunts.  Stacker 2 can help you get rid of the bunt.  Nobody wants to lay down a bunt.  No.  Lay down a bunt.  Certainly don't want to lay on a bunt.  They should call it the world's strongest bunt burner.  That's what they should call Stacker 2.  What happened to your bunt?  It's gone.  It melted away with Stacker 2.  And without the annoying of... 
[01:29:30]  Look, now we had to dump out of that.  You had to dump out of that?  You didn't have to dump out of a commercial.  I didn't have to do a commercial.  This is the commercial.  People pay for this.  They don't want to hear that.  Ixnay.  Ixnay with that reference.  I'm opening up a whole new market for them.  Certainly are.  All right.  It's Stacker 2, the world's strongest fat burner.  It gets rid of the bunt.  We dumped out of a commercial.  Jesus Christ.  That's a first on our show.  Hey, it's up to the studio.  Dumping out of a commercial.  All right.  They have a website, www.stacker2.com,  or give them a call, 1-800-LITELINE. 
[01:30:00]  That's 1-800-L-I-T-E-L-I-N-E for Stacker 2,  the world's strongest fat burner.  1027-W-N-E-W.  It's the O.P. and Anthony Show.  Chuck's sitting in with us today.  Stephen Lynch on his way into the studio in a little while.  And Psycho Mark somewhere in Midtown causing havoc, Anthony.  Yes.  A lot of fun once again on the radio program.  Absolutely.  Every day is a circus in here.  Causing havoc everywhere. 
[01:30:30]  Some guy talked to you.  What?  Let's talk to Jack real fast, right?  Jack, what's going on?  Going on, O.P. and Anthony.  All right.  Yo, remember a couple months ago,  this is when you were sick, O.P.  Like he is now.  Yeah.  I was physically sick.  Anthony, remember the girl, Carmella,  working in the,  she was working in the deli?  Oh, we got a call, yeah.  Carmella working in the deli 
[01:31:00]  and two guys that worked with her.  I am.  I'm him.  And they were going to have a threesome with this chick.  Mm-hmm.  So they all worked at the deli.  I remember hearing that from my sick vet.  Yes.  Well, what happened, Jack?  Oh, I banged her.  You did?  Uh-huh.  Dude, that doesn't sound like a threesome.  Well, no.  Well, see.  You know, you were like, just screw him.  It was kind of a threesome.  Like, I was banging her on my bed, right?  And then I left, and then my friend came in,  and then he freaking banged her.  Oh, tag team.  Yeah, tag team.  Actually, because I, you know, 
[01:31:30]  I don't want to see my friend Schween,  you know what I'm saying?  So are you just calling to brag?  Is that it?  Well, see, I don't work there no more  because, you know, I just stopped talking to her.  Yeah, I'm calling for my new job  because, you know,  it was like a bang there.  That was it.  So what's the point, though, man?  Man, I mean, I'm proud of you.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm proud of you.  Right.  But I just want to know exactly, like, why,  I mean, what's the deal? 
[01:32:00]  Well, I just want to brag, you know what I'm saying?  Oh, okay.  You know what I'm saying?  There's nothing wrong with Lil' Braggin' Bryce, right?  You know what I'm saying?  Yeah, yeah.  Lil' Braggin' Bryce never heard anything about it.  Who is this, by the way?  Oh, yeah, this is Sergeant Charlie.  Sergeant Charlie!  Oh, my God, he came apart.  I repeat, we're under heavy fire.  See, first one of the day.  Man. 
[01:32:30]  There we go, flying off into the rising sun.  I love the smell of apos in the afternoon.  I love the smell pouring in the morning.  Isn't that great, man?  Where you could just call it an airstrike on crap like that?  Oh, that's great.  I like that, man, the airstrike.  I'm going to tell you the truth.  It took me three weeks to get over the train wreck, man.  Yeah.  I just regained use of my legs.  Don't think I forgot about that.  Train wreck.  Chuck got trained that time.  Yeah, you train wrecked me, man.  But at least, Opie, now you guys don't even give any warning. 
[01:33:00]  Opie, you said, get off the trudge.  Get off the trudge.  Oh, no.  Now you just let it happen.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  All right.  Listen, I called a couple weeks ago when you had the rock on.  Yeah.  And I was busting his chops about when he goes to the Meadowlands, he's going to get up and talk and all this other stuff.  And he promised, he promised up and down that he was going to do his rock thing.  Right.  Well, lo and behold, I go out, buy tickets, take the kids to the event, and what does he do? 
[01:33:30]  He comes out, doesn't open his mouth, doesn't do a thing.  He's something that's been done about this, man.  The kids are disappointed, sadly.  Well, I've got to cut you off because Cycle Mark's back on the line.  But what I can tell you is the rock is coming in tomorrow for round two, and we'll discuss it further.  Oh, he's coming in tomorrow?  Yeah.  All right.  Take it easy.  I want to say a shout-out to The Rick.  All right.  And please call in tomorrow and confront him on that.  Don't worry.  I'll be calling him because I'm calling him out.  All right.  We've got a surprise for the Royal Rumble as well coming up Sunday when they broadcast live from Madison Square Garden. 
[01:34:00]  Oh, yeah.  Can't wait for that one.  Thank you, Mike.  All right.  Take it easy.  All right, man.  Let's go back to Cycle Mark, see if anything else is going on on the streets of Midtown.  Mark, what's going on?  Oh, what's up, guys?  Where are you?  I am.  I'd rather not say because, let's put it this way, I'm in a position where my friend Stephen Clark  is really close.  Well, don't say his name because everyone knows which station he's on.  All right.  Well, I already gave it away.  It doesn't matter.  But you're right.  They are broadcasting down from 5th and 59th. 
[01:34:30]  What are they doing?  In about four minutes, they're going to be going to the news.  Oh, my God.  They're going to open up the news.  I'm going to have the giant wild sign.  Well, I'm not going to say what I'm going to do, but.  Yeah, don't say what's going to do that.  Yeah, yeah.  Just keep everything on the QT until zero hours.  Yeah.  Just laugh.  Let's let that cycle laugh.  You got some fans in greater western New York at Hobart, William Smith College. 
[01:35:00]  Oh, really?  Hobart, William Smith College.  This guy emailed me.  Doesn't get the show, but he lives here.  He's in college.  And says, oh, my God, just saw a huge wow sign on MTV.  Guy can't hear the show.  But he felt compelled to write us and say he saw that.  Nice.  That's a good feature.  Oh, very good.  That's a good warm-up, considering we were supposed to do it tomorrow.  I hear you have a lot of fans following you all over the streets, huh?  I've gotten rid of most of the fans. 
[01:35:30]  Actually, I have nobody with me right now because I'm better off working solo than with anybody else.  I've got to tell you, the MTV thing was a huge success.  Huge.  All right, we're going for a Tuesday today.  Yeah.  We'll see if you can pull this one off today, man.  All right.  Well, keep me on hold here, all right?  All right, we'll do that.  We'll come back to you in a couple minutes.  All right.  Make sure you come back to me right before five.  We've got about three minutes to go here.  I'll do that. 
[01:36:00]  Hold on.  Yeah.  And somebody in, someone in Massachusetts, same thing, saying that they saw a wow sign on MTV.  Yeah, see, I mean, yeah.  Well, we invented the wow sign.  Where did Mark escape from, man?  Huh?  Where did Mark escape from?  That's all I want to know.  He's been doing crazy stuff for us for a while, and it's about time that he's a star, man.  Stephen Lynch still coming in today, Rick?  Yeah. 
[01:36:30]  All right.  Cool.  God, we have lots going on today.  I thought the show was going to be a dud today.  Yeah, we're having fun.  We're having a lot of fun.  We're having CV infiltration.  Let's go to Jerry real fast, and then we'll go back to Psycho Mark.  It's getting close here.  Jerry, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  All right.  You guys rock the house.  Thanks.  Yo, I was coming over to Seaside Bridge.  I was coming out of Seaside.  Yeah.  And I had a Dover Township cop follow me.  I was, like, swerving over three lanes, man, laughing so hard.  That's cool.  I pulled over.  I almost wrecked the truck. 
[01:37:00]  And I just want to tell you guys, man, yesterday was stellar.  Oh, thank you.  I just destroyed a countertop listening to you guys.  Cool.  To think we were going to take yesterday off.  Oh, yeah, right.  Yeah, it ended up we had a real good one.  We're having a fun one today, too.  Yeah, I've been trying to get in touch with you guys for, like, months, man.  And, like, Spaz keeps on hanging up on me, that douchebag.  Well, he's just trying to do his job out there.  Hey, tell Spaz I'm going to kick his ass when I see him.  All right, Jerry, thank you.  And I'm going to be listening to you guys on Thursday, man. 
[01:37:30]  If you guys need help, I'll be up in Manhattan doing some tops.  All right, cool.  So if The Rock does get out of hand, I'll be up there to kick some ass.  We'll find out Thursday.  All right, brother.  Thanks, Jerry.  Bye.  You know, I mean, there's live TV crews all over New York every single night.  So we do encourage, you know, some more of you guys to do this type of stuff.  You can do it with Wow Sign.  It is so easy to do.  Yeah.  Nothing wrong with a homemade Wow Sign.  Because eventually they're going to be on to Psycho Mark.  So his career is going to be short-lived as far as this goes.  It's a higher security that we're out there with pictures of Mark. 
[01:38:00]  Yeah.  Canvas in the crowd looking for him.  Hey, Mark, anything going on yet?  I'm just waiting.  I think I've got about one minute to go here.  Yeah, I think that's about right.  So about D-Day.  I'm just looking up.  I can see a monitor through the window here.  All right.  Hold on.  Don't give out too much, man, because they're going to be on to you.  Hold on.  No, I'm hidden.  I'll come back to you in a sec.  He's hidden.  Oh, my God.  Oh, my God.  This is bad.  Hey, Russ.  Hey, what's up, guys?  I know you have a good story, but I've got to keep you on hold.  I didn't want you to hang up, all right? 
[01:38:30]  My cell phone's starting to die.  I'll say it real quick.  No, no, no, no, because we want to do a whole segment on this.  Call back if your phone dies, all right?  I'll stay on hold.  All right, because Psycho Mark's about to attack.  If we lose you, definitely call back when you can.  Okay, man.  I'm holding.  All right, man.  News people, beware the attack of Psycho Mark.  When Psycho Mark attacks.  Psycho Mark going for a doubleheader today.  Yeah.  Well, they're just about ready to go to the news.  Here we go.  I think it might be right here. 
[01:39:00]  Okay, it's time for the news at 5.  Oh, no.  Oh, no.  Here we go.  Mark, do you see they're going live?  Yep, just about.  All right.  All right.  They're showing the killer cold.  Tough story.  Killer cold grips the tri-state area.  Now, just see if you guys can see me behind it.  Freezing inside.  People don't have heat.  Oh, my God.  What are they going to do?  There it is.  Okay, there's the live shot.  There's the live shot.  Come on, Mark.  Oh, shoot.  No, no, no.  They're still behind her head. 
[01:39:30]  All right.  Deep freeze.  Mark, what's going on?  Oh, you probably can't see it.  No, not.  Well, because they have a weird angle right now.  Don't give up hope yet.  It's just behind her head.  Hold on.  We'll tell you when you're on.  Ready?  They're going to the weather mat.  Frigid morning.  Two-bird bridge port.  Montauk, I slip.  Dude, can you get right against the window?  I'm right against the glass.  Okay, okay.  Let's see what happens.  I'm trying to get with a bunch of wolves.  All right.  They don't have a window shot yet.  That's the only problem. 
[01:40:00]  They're doing a quick weather break.  If you pull this off, dude, I swear I will crap myself.  I will absolutely crap myself.  This one will be a toughie.  Hey, Ant, this is the coldest day since January 27th, 1994.  What a goofy weather, man.  When it was zero degree.  Central Park, today's low is three degrees.  Thank you.  Thank you for that.  Let's look at some of the air temperatures in the area.  Somebody is saying that they saw them on.  We didn't see it, though.  Smithtown, eight degrees.  Shirley, eight. 
[01:40:30]  Here at Midtown, we're looking at nine degrees.  Up in Austin, ooh, get out those sweaters.  Two degrees.  All right.  Hold on, Mark.  They should go back to any second here.  Any second.  Come on.  Oh, damn.  What did they do?  Did they put a background on him?  They're trying to.  Yeah, they have a real tight shot on Steven.  And they put like a graphic right next to his head.  He's been made.  They might be on to you, man.  They might be on to you.  It looks like they're blurry.  Oh, wait.  I see.  Oh, I see. 
[01:41:00]  We see it, but we need a better.  Ah, they have to pull out, and then you're on, man.  Dude, they're going to kill me.  I mean, there's a SWAT team out here.  I could have been right there.  Three Times Square right now?  Yeah.  I saw them setting up two minutes ago.  I should have been right there behind that goon.  You could have been right there, man.  Damn.  What's the matter?  They're buzzing inside the studio like, what a B.  Hang out.  You've got to get on the live show. 
[01:41:30]  A bunch of people are on the line saying they saw him on channel.  Hold on.  Let me.  Bill, what's going on?  No, this is Bill.  Listen.  They put, you can see Michael Mark against the glass.  They put a big tarp down on it.  A big black piece of thing.  You could make out the W and the O on it.  Really?  Right behind there.  He's pressed against it.  All right.  All righty?  Oh, well, thank you.  No problem.  Everyone saw him on there.  We missed it, Ant.  We did, too.  We didn't see that.  Guys, you could see it barely, but you could see it.  You could get him to move back and forth. 
[01:42:00]  Matt, what's going on?  Hey.  Yeah, he was definitely on, right?  When they showed the two people on channel 2.  Yeah.  He was holding it sideways.  And he was like almost, he hinted out the window.  Yeah, what if they whacked the window out or something?  Yeah.  And he was right against the glass?  Yeah, definitely.  He was right in between the two.  Damn, man.  Dude.  It was the coolest thing.  We saw him on MTV, too.  Yeah, he's all over the place today.  Psycho Mark is on TV more today than anybody. 
[01:42:30]  What the hell is that?  Look at this old lady.  He's got no heat.  It's Andy Warhol's mom.  It was like the beast from that cartoon from Bugs Bunny.  What was the name of that cartoon?  The witch?  Yeah, the cartoon character in Bugs Bunny, the witch, or?  Yeah, it was a.  Was it a tweety bird's grandmother?  Yeah.  Matt, but you saw him on channel 2, huh? 
[01:43:00]  Yeah, he was definitely there.  I saw a wow.  All right.  Well, thank you.  No problem.  We're going to have to see when they go back to the anchors after this story.  Because, I mean, it looks like they're just going in with the tight shots.  Yeah, you just messed up their whole broadcast again.  Dude, they're buzzing there.  There are people running around with clipboards.  They're snapping.  Yeah, you've been made to it.  You've been made to it.  They're snapping.  They must be getting the tightest shots in the universe.  They are.  It's too bad you're not at Times Square, because that's a no-brainer today.  Look at that.  Yeah, no kidding. 
[01:43:30]  They are live from Times Square.  You would have been right behind that reporter there.  Oh, I would have ambushed him so bad.  They'll probably put that guy back on just so they can prepare for Mark.  Yeah.  Camera two only.  Camera two only.  My God.  Mark, what do you think of the odds of getting on again?  I don't know.  There's security massing outside here.  They're starting to...  Oh, they have completely moved the camera over, man.  Come on.  There's something like behind the guy's head.  Yeah.  What is that?  I am right behind that little pole. 
[01:44:00]  They're moving everybody back to get security here.  Are you kidding?  I'll step away from the glass and kiss my ass.  I'm looking up the eye.  All right.  Over his shoulder.  I saw you.  Go by her.  Go by her.  Go by her.  Left behind her head.  Behind her head.  Oh, man.  It's not late.  We saw you for a couple of seconds. 
[01:44:30]  They're so mad inside there.  They're now cordoning off the area because of me.  What country are you people from?  Argentina.  Argentina.  And do you like to stand behind TV stations like this, like I do?  This is a pastime we have in the United States.  It caused havoc among the airwaves.  She has no idea what I'm saying.  Welcome to America.  Tell me what wow is about, man.  Hey, Mike, what's up? 
[01:45:00]  Hey, guys, what's up?  All right.  I just saw a psycho mark on the TV that it was just like this little crack on, like,  the left side of the anchor's shoulder right there.  Yeah.  It was incredible.  You're getting wowed out there?  No problem.  All right.  Thanks, Mike.  No problem.  You should have come back here and lost even Clark.  Oh, man.  Mike, what's going on?  Hey, Mike. 
[01:45:30]  Mike, you there?  We lost Mike.  Mark, they have such a tight shot now.  It's not even funny.  Tell me about it.  They've cordoned off the entire area in front of the window.  You can't even get close anymore?  Oh, no.  I can get close.  I'm just waiting for the right moment.  Jimmy, what's up?  What's going on, guys?  I saw him.  He was standing there with a big smile on his face.  A nice shot of him, though.  He had a big Kool-Aid on.  I saw his white tooth.  I want to hang out with him, man. 
[01:46:00]  Yeah.  There you go.  Yeah, but they're trying to keep it tight, though.  You can even look at the anchor's head.  He's like pulling towards the other side.  Yeah, they know something's up.  They know it.  They're like gunshot.  They don't even want to see his face.  They're pulling off to the right.  You guys have a good one, man.  Keep it up.  All right, bye.  Peace.  Oh, my God.  You're freaking funny, man.  I've never seen such quick shots of the anchors in my life. 
[01:46:30]  I've been running out of news.  Where are you now, man?  I'm across the street because I'm marching an invasion on my own. 
[01:47:00]  You guys see me in that last shot?  Yeah.  I can totally see myself in the window because they've got a monitor right there,  which is the super thing they could ever do.  Well, see, on that side, you can't tell it was a wow sign,  but, I mean, if you're a fan of the show, you can tell.  They see, like, a quick W, the quick O, another W.  It's about as good as they are storming out in their studio,  like chickens without their heads on.  The director's running around.  We've got to dump out of Mark.  He's cursing.  He's cursing like a crazy man. 
[01:47:30]  Yeah, no, I'm not big fans of them.  Let's put it that way.  What a day for cycle, Mark, huh?  You're on the TV.  I'll have to win an Emmy.  All right, Mark, we've got to take a break.  We're so late.  All right.  A call back if anything's going on, okay?  Yep.  All right, there he goes, everyone.  Psycho Mark.  Opie and Anthony.  Yeah, can we get these illiterates off the air, please?  We suck.  If I wasn't on it, I wouldn't listen. 
[01:48:00]  1027 WNEW.  1027 WNEW.  It's Opie and Anthony.  Chuck's in the studio.  I see outside the studio that Stephen Lynch has arrived.  Yes.  We'll be talking to him in a few minutes.  I believe he's got a gig tonight, right?  Is that why he's here tomorrow?  Okay.  We'll talk to him about that in a few minutes.  Rob, what's going on?  Hey, guys.  Great show.  Thanks.  I've got to tell you, if Psycho Mark ever gets arrested, I'll be happy to volunteer to  take his place.  And I've got a suggestion for another bit you might want to try. 
[01:48:30]  I'm not sure I can say the name of the network, but it's the Big Sports Network up  in Bristol, Connecticut.  They've got one version.  They've got the Network 2, Network News.  Their news studio is in the main building.  And they've got a window that goes the entire length of the building that people walk through  and behind all the time.  So you always see people back there.  That would be, I mean, MTV reaches a lot of viewers.  ESPN reaches, ESPN News.  Oh, sorry.  I don't know if I was supposed to say that. 
[01:49:00]  It doesn't matter because you don't know when we're going to attack.  That's a good point.  They're not going to shut down because of the Opie and Anthony show.  Don't forget about us, and then a month from now or so, it'll happen, right.  It would just be, I mean, doing a live shot outside.  One thing, we get Psycho Mark or someone to infiltrate the studio.  Right.  I've got a sister that works there.  I'm not sure how much that would help you guys out, but I think that'd be a pisser.  I almost killed myself driving home.  We want Psycho Mark to spawn others.  Hmm.  Well.  I mean, there are live crews all over New York every single day. 
[01:49:30]  Every single day.  So if there's any Psycho Mark juniors out there that want to, you know, take Psycho Mark's  lead, go for it.  You know, I've been inspired.  All right.  Great show, guys.  I'd never get home from work without you guys.  Thank you.  We appreciate that.  Later.  All right.  Bye.  Let's go to Tim.  Tim, what's going on?  Hey, what's up, guys?  You saw it behind that black lady, right?  Yeah.  Well, now there's like a security guard walking back and forth.  Can you feel?  Yeah.  That's hysterical.  You guys are totally screwing up the show. 
[01:50:00]  I love it.  Yeah.  It's so classic.  Oh, cool, man.  Got my dad listed now for the first time.  He's like, these guys are nuts.  Yeah.  I don't know what's going to happen on the show on a day-to-day basis.  All right.  You guys are a little bit.  All right.  Thanks, Tim.  All right.  Love you, Joy.  All right.  Peace.  Bye.  It's echoing.  Go ahead.  Sound like you want to see me.  Yeah.  Bill, what's up?  What's going on, man?  All right.  Beach ball balls, man.  That's what I said.  Beach ball balls.  Psycho Mark has beach ball balls, man.  I don't know how he does it, but he manages to walk around with a big-ass pass. 
[01:50:30]  I can't even tell you how big his freaking Johnson is.  Yeah.  Well, you know what?  A lot of people on the Instant Feedbacker are telling Psycho Mark to go for the hat trick  today.  Hell, yeah.  We're going for a third.  We can't tell you where yet, so.  A hat trick.  A hat trick.  A Psycho Mark hat trick.  Yeah.  He's been on TRL, MTV.  Yeah.  That was for like 40 minutes.  I mean, over and over again, we were on there. 
[01:51:00]  Yeah.  He was on Channel 2.  Channel 2's 5 o'clock news, right behind Stephen Clark and Dana Tyler.  Until they tightened the shot, right?  It was like ear to ear.  That's it.  Yeah.  Just their lips.  Today the news.  I feel bad for the actors, because we saw all the acne and everything, because they  had to get in so close.  Tight shot.  It looked like that scene of the DJ in the Warriors.  Makeup!  Mike, what's up?  How you doing, all day?  All right.  I was just watching Total Request Live. 
[01:51:30]  Yeah.  And that was hilarious, man.  I was just watching Russell Channel 2.  Yeah.  Oh, man.  You guys rock.  I know.  And drinking Jack Daniels.  Oh, yeah.  You guys rock, man.  All right.  Thank you, Mike.  Bye.  Bye.  I was just watching Total Request Live.  No, wait.  That was a porno.  John, what's up?  Hey.  How you guys doing?  Real good.  All right.  I was down there behind Psycho Mark by MTV.  He was going nuts over there.  He is crazy. 
[01:52:00]  He almost got hit by a bus and a truck and a cab.  Yo, he was running around like a crackle with crabs.  He was all over the place.  Well, anyway, look.  I think you guys are great.  And I just want to let you know, my cousin Santos, he wants to go out there and, you know,  become one of the Psycho Marks prawns there.  All right.  Yeah.  We're encouraging you guys to, you know, take Psycho Marks lead and do it anytime you see  a live, you know, a live guy on the street.  All right.  You guys, yo, can I call in on Thursday?  I want to talk to Rock.  I want to put him down a little bit.  Yeah. 
[01:52:30]  Rock will be in here Thursday.  All right, guys.  Sometime after five, we found out today, so.  All right.  Cool.  All right, John.  Thank you.  Later.  All right.  Bye.  I'm going to tell you one thing, though, man.  Psycho Mark is letting me see it.  It's good to be white.  Because, you know, if he was a brother, his ass would have been in cuffs a long time ago.  Come on.  Well, for a more serious crime.  Okay.  I was going there.  Don't worry about it.  Liz, what's up?  Yeah, what's up?  You were the girl that wowed Mark while he was trying to do his job? 
[01:53:00]  Yes, I did.  Bravo.  Very nice of you.  He enjoyed that.  I think that he deserved it.  You know, he's been standing out there jumping like a little, you know.  Liz, you got a dirty little mouth on you, too.  Yeah, I know.  I'm listening to you guys so much.  All right.  Well, thank you, Liz.  You're welcome.  All right, bye.  You can't curse.  Psycho Mark's on line 12.  Mark.  Hey, what's happening, guys?  What's going on?  Oh, just hanging out here on the call.  A lot of people want you to go for the hat trick today. 
[01:53:30]  Well, yeah, we need to the next place.  Huh?  I've got to find the next broadcast.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Well, you know what would be really nice, and I think Channel 2 would appreciate, was that?  Some nice fresh cans behind their heads in the window during a broadcast.  Well, that would certainly perk things up, wouldn't it?  Wouldn't that top the day?  We're just getting this report that Mike and the Mad Dog Show is live from the NBA store right now.  Get out of town.  Isn't that close to right where you are? 
[01:54:00]  Yeah.  That's a nuclear bomb waiting to happen, though.  What else?  Check on that.  Why is he getting up to the show?  You've got to give him a lot of credit, but kill him.  Hey, Mark, are you going to do what we discussed, or what?  It depends.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm going to make my way over to my favorite spot in a little bit.  Okay.  And do my thing.  But I definitely still think we should get some chicks down here.  If there are any chicks in the area.  All right.  And I'm right down to 59th and 5th. 
[01:54:30]  All right.  On the corner.  Okay.  And come down and show their stuff.  All right.  With me and my nice, lovely wild sign.  All right, Mark.  Well, you call back soon.  Something's going on, okay?  Yeah, I'll be standing here.  People know where I am.  All right, man.  Psycho Mark, the Pied Piper of Fun Bag.  It's unbelievable.  Craig, you're next.  What's going on?  Hey, what's up, Opie and Anthony, man?  I just saw Psycho Mark on TV with the yellow and red wild sign, man.  He is crazy. 
[01:55:00]  He is totally crazy.  I'm calling up all my friends.  They're all laughing and crap.  Cool.  Well, thank you, Craig.  People like Psycho Mark on the TV.  Of course they do.  Jason, what's up?  You guys should give Psycho Mark as a salary also.  Really?  Yes.  He was on Channel 2 waving that sign back and forth going crazy.  Yeah, he was pretty much in every shot there on the news for the first ten minutes.  In the last five minutes, I was on the hold watching it.  They had the wide angle because I guess they know you a lot. 
[01:55:30]  Yeah.  And Dog is there by himself.  So, if you want to come down there.  All right.  Well, thank you, Jason.  You guys rock.  All right, man.  Evan from Jersey.  Dana Tyler wanted to whip him out so bad you could see it in her eyes.  All right.  We've got to take another quick break.  Stephen Lynch is waiting to come in here, so let's talk to him next.  And if anything pops with Psycho Mark, we'll definitely get him right back on the radio.  Late breaking.  We'll even break right into commercials if we have to.  So, stay right there.  I'm hoping Christopher Walken's going to, you know. 
[01:56:00]  Oh, jeez.  Make the guy ask.  It's a big Hollywood star, isn't it?  Stop by the show today.  Look, everybody, Victoria's Secret.  My friends, they want to shop.  Buy underpants for them and theirs.  Look at Ziggy.  Four feet tall laying down.  Let the man buy crotch's panties.  Maybe a nice flannel and some.  Look, your manager's uptight.  There's nothing you can do to stop us.  Look, we're a mass. 
[01:56:30]  Opie and Anthony, 102.7 Talk Radio.  Forget it.  Why listen to music?  You own the album.  What are you going to listen to?  Rock and roll.  You own that record.  Put it on 1027.  Listen to the homeless.  It's a riot, baby.  It's a riot.  En masse.  A peaceful assemblage of people.  Smelly.  White.  Black.  But they all smell.  White.  Black.  Puerto Rican.  No Chinese.  They could carry on.  They take care of their own. 
[01:57:00]  They don't let them get homeless.  When's the last time you saw a Chinese homeless man?  Never.  They invite them in with open arms.  Not like the whites and the blacks.  They say, don't come home.  You can go to Chinatown.  If you're Chinese, down on your luck.  You can wash dishes.  Go to a cockfight.  You're never on the outs as a Chinaman.  It's too bad.  Unless you have red hair.  If you're 300 pounds and have red hair, then they don't like you.  You're like a 300 pound redheaded Chinese man. 
[01:57:30]  It's strange, really.  Go to Short Hills Mall.  I command you.  No one will know.  No one will know.  Opie's Anthony.  1027.  Bravo.  Christopher Walken, everything.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Grown men jumping all over each other.  Okay, terrific.  1027.  1027.  WNEW.  1027.  WNEW.  It's the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:58:00]  Pretty much screwing off once again today.  I can't stand right here.  Psycho Mark.  Psycho Mark, we got you live on the radio.  I promise.  I'm really interested in television careers and stuff like that.  You're welcome.  Yeah, no.  The banner is a brace.  A brace.  He's trying to get on the news more than his time.  Hey, what's happening?  What's your name?  What?  Alexia?  Alexia.  Alexia.  You're glad you showed up here.  It looks like she wants to wow the...  Oh, no. 
[01:58:30]  You want to wow the...  Would you be willing to wow her?  She's laughing.  Is that a yes?  No.  Hopefully, we can run up next to the window and you can flash your boobies real quick.  What'd I tell you, sir?  Yeah, you guys got to be fast.  We're going for the closing shot in seconds here, man.  In seconds.  Make it happen, Mark.  Make it happen.  Come on, Mark.  This would be the ultimate...  Come on, Mark.  This would truly be the ultimate.  Come on, Mark.  What you got to do is you got to run right up there and you're going to go sideways along 
[01:59:00]  all the windows.  So you got to do like a crab walk.  Yeah, sidestep the whole window.  No matter which way they look, you're going to at least, you're going to see some hooters.  I'm going to get arrested.  No, you won't get arrested.  It's not a crime.  We've got everyone's listening around us.  We've got literally like thousands of people sitting in their cars just sort of just hanging  out here.  All right, here we go.  The horse...  All right, here we go.  Horse puncher.  Way, way, way, way.  It's behind his ear.  Behind his ear, you'll see it. 
[01:59:30]  Hold on.  Over here.  Over there.  You got to get behind his ear.  Go, go, go, go, go.  Go, go, go.  God damn it.  Oh, he just missed it.  Damn it.  Oh, son of a rat.  How close were we to getting a while on TV?  Pretty close.  They have such a tight shot, it's difficult.  But I think we can give another go at it.  All right, yeah.  The bear in here is pretty lax, if you know what I mean.  All right.  You got one last shot.  They're going to do a wide shot.  All right.  It's his...  If you're looking at the back of his head, it would be to his right is a small opening. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah.  Yeah.  We got to do it right behind his head.  You see...  They always end with a wide shot.  If they don't end with a wide shot, that means we influence their whole day.  Yeah.  Directing, once again.  You know what side of that pole right there is in that small window?  That looks like a good spot.  Let's see.  All right.  Let's see what happens.  They're nuts, man.  You got to wow on TV.  That'll be you.  Good try.  Good try.  All right.  I'll cover you with security, all right? 
[02:00:30]  I'll cover you with security.  She's laughing.  She's laughing.  She's laughing.  Oh, crap.  Here comes the reinforcement.  Oh, damn.  See, everyone listens to our show.  This is the problem.  Yeah.  They're listening to the show.  You know what?  They have to broadcast there every day.  So, if we don't get it today, which I'm pretty confident we will.  Look at how smooth you are, Mart.  Yeah, they're with Pablo Guzman.  We're standing about 15, 20 feet behind the glass. 
[02:01:00]  Security's in front of us.  Right.  And we're looking right in the studio right now.  Okay.  And you can just see everybody in there is absolutely like a thermometer.  All right?  The heads are about to pop.  They're steaming.  The camera guy.  Here he's behind.  All right.  There he is.  Yeah, his ear.  Right there.  Go to his ear.  Go to his ear.  Go to his ear.  Right to the right of that post that's behind him.  Now it's behind her.  Behind her.  Behind her.  They do a flip.  I can't see if he's standing right here.  He's right there.  Hey, is that him?  Is that him?  Come on. 
[02:01:30]  Get the boob.  Get the boob.  Get the boob.  You got the wild side eye.  You got the wild side eye.  Goddamn.  God.  Come on, man.  Oh, Jesus.  Here we go, guys.  It's the end of the story.  Come with me.  Come on.  Oh, my God.  They're getting out of here.  I think they're fleeing.  Yeah, let's go.  All right, Mark.  You all right?  Yeah, no, we're cool, but he put up calling his microphone, and I got to start running.  All right.  All right.  Mark's running away.  It's time for me to go.  All right, Mark.  Dixie wow, Ben. 
[02:02:00]  All right.  I'm safe now.  You're safe?  Yeah, but they're pretty mad.  We saw the wow sign.  Yeah, you know, the boob shot just, we're going to need a ladder for this.  All right.  You know, we'll get that to happen on another station.  We're going to need a ladder with wheels, you know, so we can skate right in.  Oh.  Well, let's see what's going on at 6 o'clock.  Very good.  There's got to be someone doing a live shot somewhere at 6.  All right.  If our listeners can help us out and tell us where the news crews are, that would be greatly appreciated.  All right?  All right.  I'll stand by right here. 
[02:02:30]  I have a feeling they're all setting up in Times Square, Mark.  All right.  I'm going to head back there anyhow.  All right, man.  Is that chick coming with you to wow?  Yeah, why not?  I'll be on with me.  All right.  I'll get it with you.  If you get some wowage on TV, you will be everyone's hero.  All right.  Call.  Call back, man.  All right.  All right.  There he goes once again, Psycho Mark.  Anthony, live in the studio, Stephen Lynch.  Yes.  He's been looking at the festivities.  Yeah, he's a lunatic.  You haven't met Mark yet?  I don't think I've met Mark.  I think he went to the bachelor party. 
[02:03:00]  I think he was there.  Oh, right.  Yeah.  He was pretty mellow back then.  Psychopath.  Yeah.  He was pretty funny.  I found him very shy and quiet.  Yeah.  Didn't have much to say.  This guy will do anything now.  We give him signs and stuff.  It doesn't matter.  No, it doesn't matter.  He'll do anything.  It's amazing.  Where can I get one of those?  You said you were at home and you were watching MTV and you saw the wild side?  I saw the big wild side.  I saw a guy jumping up and down with a big wild side.  Yeah, they went to a much wider shot now.  Yeah.  Well, they don't have to worry anymore.  Mark's gone.  Stephen Clark looks pissed. 
[02:03:30]  They know what's going on.  Yeah.  Professionals.  So, you're playing or what, man?  Yeah, where are you playing?  Well, I've got a couple shows coming up tomorrow in Ocean Township at Rascals and then the next  day at West Orange Rascals.  Right.  Should be some good stuff.  A lot of good things going on.  Rascals.  Are you still doing the VH1?  I haven't done it this year yet.  No.  New Year, no.  I'm kind of their utility guy.  They call me in when somebody's sick.  Like somebody called in sick.  Right.  Call up that Lynch kid. 
[02:04:00]  But I'm working on the new album.  It should be awesome.  Oh, really?  Oh, God.  It's so much fun.  Yeah, we're going to check out the studio today.  Hopefully, it'll be available in other places than just Pushhead at AOL.com.  You can always go to Amazon.  That's where the front is.  Oh, okay.  I thought maybe you just had to go to Pushhead at AOL.com.  You can if you like.  But if you know how to spell Steven Lynch, you just go to Amazon.com and you can order  his CD.  Yeah.  Or you can email him personally, Pushhead at AOL.com.  I'm gunning for early March for the new one. 
[02:04:30]  And I think it should be pretty good.  Oh, yeah?  No problems with lawyers making you not able to put out your CD?  No, I don't think so.  Oh, I think if that happens, I'm going out of the trunk route again.  Is that it?  Yeah, Steven just piles a bunch of CDs in the trunk of his car, opens it up, and is like,  yo, man, what you need?  I'm your mama.  I'm your daddy.  Yeah, we're having a problem with our CD, Steven.  Yeah, I'm waiting for it to come out.  It was ready to go.  A double CD from Opie and Anthony. 
[02:05:00]  And I don't know where we stand at this point.  It's going to be all real relevant stuff by the time it comes out.  Hey, how about that Ted offensive, huh?  How about those gooks in Vietnam?  You know, we've got to get our boys home.  I think we have a Jimmy Carter bid on there.  Yeah.  It's the upcoming moon landing.  It's going to be.  Yeah, yeah.  Kennedy says we'll be going to the moon before the end of the decade.  I don't believe it.  Relevant stuff like that.  The bastards.  Well, can't you take it back now and maybe throw some other stuff on there? 
[02:05:30]  Yeah, well, yeah.  Why not?  That's exactly what we're going to do.  You've got to put that walk-in imitation on there if it's not on there.  Oh, my God.  Can you put that on there?  From Jay Moore?  Jay Moore.  Oh, my God.  From Chris Walken.  Yeah, we can do that.  We have new bosses, and they sent the CD to the lawyers again to see what could be done.  How long have the new bosses been here?  A month.  And they still like us.  Yeah.  How about that?  They actually like what we're doing.  Like, remember last time, the big controversy with you playing a song? 
[02:06:00]  My 22nd song.  I had to wait four hours to play it.  Yeah, four hours to play it because it had to run through more clearance than, like, somebody that's going to be a Secret Service agent.  Right.  And you played it.  It was hysterically funny and not one bad thing in a song that couldn't be played over the air.  But that was the atmosphere.  I felt like Diana Ross at the, you know, at the airport before I could play my song.  Yeah, exactly.  The cavity search is on me.  Yeah, you got the full-body cavity search.  And that was the atmosphere that we were under here on the Opie and Anthony show for many months, and it brought us down. 
[02:06:30]  So all that's changed.  It's gone now.  So the new bosses are better?  Wow, we can say that.  No, no, no.  I seem to have lost my mind for a second.  I said the F word.  I'm sorry.  I'm going to get my guitar.  I got tons of new stuff to play.  What Ant wanted to say was F yes.  Oh, my God.  I'm going to say, man, they really are cool.  That's awesome.  Wow, yeah.  They've been cool.  We're waiting for that.  Friends in the F season.  Now, we're waiting for the day where we cross the line, and they've got to, like, bring us awkwardly into their office and sit us down and talk to us, you know. 
[02:07:00]  Because it's just like, yeah, a month.  That's the longest we've gone without getting in trouble with the bosses.  Because, like, remember the old bosses when we first met them and everything, and it was every time we ran into them in the halls, hey, guys, how's it going?  What's up?  But then there's that first day.  It's like, all right, meet in my office now.  And it's like, that's it.  It's over, you know.  The honeymoon's over.  And it was just like that for so long.  Even though, I mean, Scott Herman, we got along great with him.  Right.  But even he had to deal with a lot of the stuff. 
[02:07:30]  Yeah.  And I think he didn't enjoy dealing with it.  You should see him now.  He comes in here with, like, Hawaiian shirts on with laser around his neck, sipping pina coladas with a straw hat on.  He's the happiest guy on the face of the earth now that he has nothing to do with the Opie and Anthony show anymore.  He looks 10 years younger, Steve.  Really?  He's like, you know what?  He looks at the new bosses that are coming in, like the seasoned soldier that's shipping out of country.  He's, like, shipping out of Nam.  He's on the Huey.  Bye.  I did my time.  And they're shipping out. 
[02:08:00]  And he looks at the new recruits.  And it's like, coming in.  Yeah, look at this.  Fresh meat.  You know, I was a rookie once, kid.  Yeah.  Just looking.  10 years on the force.  You change your attitude.  Yeah.  But that's the atmosphere we were under.  Now, though, we're getting a little more leeway.  Our new boss looks like he's 17.  By the time we're done with him, he's going to look like he's 45.  We'd like to take him out for years.  You guys can pretty much do any bit that you want to do or play anything you want to play.  Within reason.  And we're still working on other things.  So, like, we can't play the dry, dry, dry Vag song. 
[02:08:30]  Still?  Oh, man.  Still.  Can't put it on.  But we're working on that one.  My favorite tune.  So, isn't that a fave?  My favorite tune.  That the world is not allowed to hear that song is a travesty.  Isn't it like locking up the Mona Lisa in a box somewhere so people can't view it?  It truly is.  Dry, dry, dry.  We've got to get there.  Oh, wait a minute.  So, you can say the title, but you can't sing it?  No, you can sing it like dry, dry, dry. 
[02:09:00]  It's like listening to Dr. Drek.  We've got to get that on the unofficial website.  Hell, yeah.  Mark's in a car with a listener now.  Psycho Mark, what's up?  I'm being apprehended.  I didn't say it.  You did say it.  I had to dump out, you idiot.  I covered myself right at the very end.  So, what's up?  Nothing.  I'm getting a ride right now from this gentleman. 
[02:09:30]  This guy named Joe.  All right.  He's got a gun to my head.  You're getting him a Hummer.  I'm going to die.  I'm going to die.  No, I'm cool.  And Galaxia's in a backseat, and she's prepared to flash the goods.  And we're sort of like a little SWAT team right now.  We're having it around the city.  Mark, listen.  Mess with any other TV station except for CBS.  Well, we've got to find another one.  If the listeners can find out who's broadcasting where. 
[02:10:00]  All right.  And that'd be me, man.  That would be a lot of fun, because we'll go there right now.  We're actually right outside the building.  All right.  Yeah, we're real close.  All right.  We'll call in if anything's happening, all right?  All right.  Well, let me know.  Call me back if any of the listeners find out.  We will do that.  I'm going to go anywhere just to see if we can find something.  All right, man.  Let's go to Allison.  Psycho Mark looking for a live shot to a. . .  Wow.  He's going for a hat trick.  He's got a girl, though, with him, and she'll show boobs on live TV. 
[02:10:30]  Has he ever tried to get right into the middle of the TRL thing?  Oh, the big group of people?  Where they, you know, go, I want to hear the backseat.  Yeah, no, no.  That was our first try today.  He's a little too old for that, probably, right?  Yeah, you know, you know, they're going to get right out of the crowd.  Producers, come here.  You, got to go.  The best part was, like. . .  He's like trudging over a bunch of 14-year-old girls.  It'd be a little much in for this show.  The best part, Freddie Prinze Jr. is doing his thing, and in the background, there's a whole  freaking mess going on.  Mark's, like, avoiding traffic.  He's almost getting hit by car. 
[02:11:00]  Yeah, it's a car pulled up.  You didn't see the cop.  I thought the cop was going to nail him.  He's probably a fan of the show.  All right.  Allison, you still on the line?  Yeah.  What's going on?  I'm going to induct my boyfriend into the Tuesday Night Hummer Club.  There you go.  Really?  Yeah.  Just because of our show, you're going to give him a Hummer?  Well, yeah, every Tuesday.  Oh, very nice.  Yeah.  Where are you guys?  By Clinton.  Clinton?  Uh-huh.  Clinton?  Clinton?  Clinton?  Who, the president? 
[02:11:30]  He's going to want one, too.  Forget him.  He's disgusting.  You're in Clinton.  That's. . .  All right.  Okay.  Well, what do you want to do with this one, Ed?  Right now?  Yeah.  She wants to induct him?  Could go for the old bite.  I don't know.  Maybe she could just hum a tune.  What?  You want to hum a tune while you're doing the deed?  No.  Why not?  I'm not that talented.  Yeah, you can.  No.  You just put it where it belongs, and then just hum a song. 
[02:12:00]  Hum.  No?  No.  We'll be good at that.  Come on, practice.  Put your thumb in your mouth and hum right now.  If you can do that, you can do it.  Absolutely.  See?  There you go.  All right.  There you go.  You're ready to go.  No?  Will she take requests?  No.  All right, Allison.  We'll have fun with your hummer.  Thanks.  All right.  Bye.  Obviously, a lost cause.  Oh, we're supposed to give out Opie Goes to South Central today.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  We got a bunch of those. 
[02:12:30]  That was hysterical.  We talked about this porno movie.  That's out.  It's called Opie Goes to South Central.  It's out there.  It shows this Opie-looking guy, like a Ron Howard type-looking guy.  Someone yell to Spaz to run down the hall like a lunatic and get a copy.  He'll bring it in in 10 seconds.  And he's in South Central, L.A., with a bunch of the brothers next to him.  Right.  And he's just got this big smile on his face.  And it's a porno movie.  I don't know what happens to Opie in this movie.  You haven't watched the movie yet?  No, we haven't seen it yet.  But the company that made the movie, after we talked about it, sent us a box of, like, 25 of these things to give us to our listeners. 
[02:13:00]  Yeah.  Are they all, like, white guys and black chicks?  I don't know.  It's, like, one white guy, this Opie guy, and then a bunch of brothers.  I don't know what happens.  Maybe.  I don't know.  It's a gay movie.  I don't know what happened.  Hey, Opie, I'm going to introduce you to my friend Sonequa.  Maybe he gets some sisters.  I priced on an interracial gay porno.  I was going to say, I swear to God.  Don't let that thing between his legs bother you.  No, it sucks.  But we've got to get some clips off that for the radio show.  Yeah, maybe we should have screened it before we gave it away. 
[02:13:30]  We're like, oh, my God, Opie and Anthony giving away gay interracial porno.  Oh, hot black man ass from Opie and Anthony.  This black guy's, like, railing his leg guy.  It's a true prison film.  Would you give us over here?  Here comes Spaz with a copy of the tape.  Sean, what's going on?  Yeah, what's up?  All right.  Hey.  You're on the air.  Let's go real quick.  Hey, how you doing, man?  All right.  Yeah, listen, I saw him back there behind the glass there for Channel 2. 
[02:14:00]  Right.  Yeah, they're doing all the wide shots.  This is unbelievable.  Yeah, now that he's gone, he's got the wide shots.  Oh, yeah, now they've got the wide shots.  He's like a freaking police car five blocks away with his lights on.  I know.  A-holes, man.  Anyway, I've got three TVs on side by side here.  He's got all the networks.  I've got two, four, and seven up.  So as soon as one of them says they're going live, I'll try to call back in.  I'll let you know.  Yeah, we've got to try to figure out where the other stations are broadcasting live from tonight.  Oh, man, but you guys have got a great show going.  I've been laughing all day.  Oh, thanks, Sean.  And that TVN thing was freaking hysterical. 
[02:14:30]  Cool, thank you.  All right, you guys have a good night, man.  All right, man.  Bye-bye.  That was nothing compared to the MTV thing, but who's got the Opie goes to...  Yeah, this isn't gay.  All right, thank God.  Because Kira's in it and Dominique Simone.  Ah.  Yeah, look, he's got like a Spanish broad in there and a black chick.  That's pretty cool.  Look at like the brothers pointing at the Opie guy.  One guy's got his fingers like a gun and looking at him like he's going to shoot him.  Because that's the real version of Opie goes to South Central.  Yeah, there wouldn't be any chicks in the future. 
[02:15:00]  Because the last thing you're going to take when you're going to take a wrong term on the  Hollywood freeway is a, you know, I almost said it, man.  Can someone get spazzed?  Because knowing spazzed, he's going to give this porno to a 14-year-old and we're going  to get screwed.  Oh, yeah.  You better make sure.  Spazz, make sure they're 18, all right?  All right.  Very good.  I thought it was your episode of Andy Griffith.  It's fast.  We'll give away two, all right?  Tenth and Eleventh Caller gets a copy of Opie goes to South Central.  It's like some country rube guy.  He's got his little suitcase from Nebraska or something. 
[02:15:30]  And he's with the chicks.  He's giving a thumbs up to the camera.  Yeah.  The hood ain't so bad after all.  Yeah.  We'll sign the box, too.  Look at the cans on this black chick.  Jesus Christ.  We'll sign the box and we'll give you a...  Sign the box.  Opie, she has a name.  Wow, she does have a nice set there.  All right.  Tenth and Eleventh Callers get a copy of Opie goes to South Central.  Sorry about that, man.  Right on to the camera.  Oh, that's good.  212-757-1027. 
[02:16:00]  All right.  Steven Lynch in the studio.  Where's the gig again, Steven?  Tomorrow in Ocean Township at Rascals and the next day at Rascals in West Orange.  All right.  You brought some e-mails from our listeners?  Yeah.  All right.  Yeah.  I never get to respond to the fans.  All right.  Your fans and mine who e-mail me.  And I thought maybe I'd just read a couple of these and then...  Can we do it next?  Yeah, that's great.  Let's...  Because you didn't bring your guitar.  We can play one of the songs you've played on our show before. 
[02:16:30]  Okay.  Which one do you want to hear today?  Your choice.  We've played all of them, so...  I really...  What Steven Lynch song do you want to hear, Chuck?  Okay, wait a minute.  Gerbil.  Gerbil.  Gerbil?  Yeah.  All right.  We haven't played Gerbil in a while.  I love that.  All right.  Here we go.  More with Steven Lynch in just a bit.  Stay there.  This one is called Gerbil.  I bought a Gerbil at the petting zoo.  If Richard Gere can do it, I can too. 
[02:17:00]  I get undressed.  I start to lube.  I steep the Gerbil in the end of the tube.  Wondering just how he'll feel.  Will he like it better than his little wheel?  Careful now.  Careful now.  He's right beside me.  One more inch and he's inside me.  Go!  Gerbil go.  Oh! 
[02:17:30]  Borough harder, borough deeper.  Be my little chimney sweeper.  One thing I forgot about  How am I supposed to get you out?  So now my gerbil's on easy street  It's warm and cozy and there's plenty to eat 
[02:18:00]  The situation is beyond my control  Gotta find a way to get him out of this hole  I try crowbars, I try wires  I almost hurt him with a pair of pliers  I try cheese, but he's not fighting  I wish this wasn't so exciting  Girl, trouble, girl

Rascals  Rascals, very good  Stone  Alright, you brought some email in, Stephen Lynch  What's this about?  Just a couple of them  I just wanted to read a couple of them  They're really short  And are faithful listeners  Some of your fans and mine  Enjoy you and your music here on the Opie and Anthony show  Yeah, and it's just really cool  I get a lot of these  And I don't always get to answer them  So I figured I'd do it for the listeners today  Okay  From some dude named Dragfly 
[02:27:30]  He says, you rock  That's pretty nice  That's cool  That was cool  We like that  You're my kind of guy  Can you tell me where you'd be playing next?  I have some friends  I would appreciate your unusual look at life  How can I get some of your recordings?  Love you on WNEW  Nice  She's a fan of yours  Yeah, cool  Great  Heard you on the radio and you suck  I think that's one of your fans  That's good  That means good  Yeah, that's good  Songs?  Question mark  Question mark  You suck  All right, maybe he's not so good  Uh-oh  You know you have no talent  So you make fun of the handicapped  Uh-oh, wait a minute 
[02:28:00]  Steven Lynch gets his brain analyzed  How this sick, deranged, sadistic, psycho bastard  Is permitted to walk free in this society  Is beyond me  How can you even think of booking him in public places?  That was to my agent  Oh, really?  Yeah  Just got done reviewing the lyrics from Kill a Kill  Just to see the expressions on your little faces  Does it make you feel like a man to write such things?  Well, I've been in the company of real men  Uh-oh  For a very long time  And now I think it is your turn  Uh-oh  You're pretty desperate to have to make a living 
[02:28:30]  By promoting the infliction of pain on small animals  You're a knuckle-dragging example of de-evolution  And you got your reaction all right  I wish I could be the one to stick dynamite up your ass  Wow  Light that fuse and do the world a favor  You need to be extinguished  I'm noticing a trend with a lot of these letters  Wanting to do certain things to your ass  I have taken the liberty of sending your name, email, address, and webpages  To my buddies in Attica and Rikers  So they can come, C-U-M, and check you out as well 
[02:29:00]  So, again, Tim, I just want to say thank you  You guys are great  I appreciate your support  You really couldn't be any more supportive  You know what amazes me?  It seems like there were a couple of letters in there from prisoners  And people that know prisoners  These are people that are in prison  Maybe for a killing, rape, assault, and whatnot  Yeah, but that's human life  Yeah, they're upset with a song  It's a kitten  A song about a kitten 
[02:29:30]  Right, right, exactly  You didn't actually need to motivate yourself to write the song  By stepping on a kitten  Kerosene and then lighting him on fire  Sticking things up his butt  I mean, it was a song  Just the very notion  Very upset, right  Well, they have that right  And, uh  Hey, can we play another Stephen Lynch song here?  Oh, no, which one's this going to be?  This just happens to be my favorite  This is called The Pope Sucks Me  It's a great one 
[02:30:00]  I don't think it ought to cause too much of a concern  Oh, were you looking through my notebook?  Is that going to be on the new album?  On the new album  The Pope Sucks Me  And then you can read all the hate mail that came in for this song as well  I'm sure you have a stack of them there  Uh, actually, those are the only good ones that I've found  Well, the rest of them were actually kind of well-written  Oh, I see  Those aren't the fun ones  Obviously, from listeners  You want the ones to say, I don't have to F you in the ass  Obviously, they were written from the listeners of PLJ 
[02:30:30]  The educated ones  Well, I mean, you could sit here while we play this song  But I don't think you want to be sitting here while we play your next song  Uh-oh, really?  Yeah  I don't know what the next song is  I'm not telling you  Do you have to leave?  Are you kicking me out?  No  Do you guys really have to leave?  Very curious now  What, you got a gun?  Yeah, I'm curious too  It's a song you told us not to play anymore  Oh, that one 
[02:31:00]  Oh, the one I didn't write?  Didn't have nothing to do with you, me?  Yeah  Yeah, that one  Hey, where are you going?  Hey, wait, wait, what's up?  Hey, see you guys later?  Come on, have a good day  Play whatever you want  If you really have to leave, we'll wrap it up  And then we'll end with a song  So you didn't even know we played it  Played what?

All right  Excellent show as usual  Hey, thanks  Thank you, sir  This wooden leg thing  The guy just mentioned  At the shoe store  Reminds me of something  That happened to me a long time  Actually, it didn't happen to me  It was years ago  I used to have a motorcycle repair shop  And one of my better customers  Had the misfortune of losing a leg  In an accident 
[02:38:30]  From the knee down  And he was fitted with a prosthesis  And after, you know  The normal period of healing  And whatnot  He decided to get his bike fixed  And so he was riding again  And he's riding down  In Summit, New Jersey  On Broad Street  Which is like a really pristine  Quiet community  And this old ginker  Pulls out of a parking spot  Without checking  And hits him  So he falls off the bike  And he really didn't get hurt  But the prosthesis comes off  So the old guy gets out of the car  He looks down  He looks at the guy  Are you okay? 
[02:39:00]  The guy says  Yeah, I'm all right  I'm all right  Don't worry about it  And he looks over  And he sees his leg laying there  And he says  Well, if you're right  Whose leg is it?  He says  Don't worry  It's not my leg  It's not my leg  And he says  The guy started to get weak-kneed  And it looked like  He was going to pass out  Oh my God  Oh my God  You know, I think  He might have been deaf  He might have been walking  On the track 
[02:39:30]  Oh my God  Do you ever hear those stories  Of the people that are deaf  And they're walking on the tracks  And like they never see it coming  Like just  You're looking at the horizon  And the track's going down  And the train's like  Right behind you  You just never saw it  Poor guy  Like the guy who was hit  Looking the wrong way  Down the track  Yeah, same thing  On the subway  Just didn't see it coming  Not a clue  I think Alan has more  On the stupid guy  From Wheel of Fortune  Alan, what's up?

What's up, brother, man?  I just wanted to add something  To that story about this guy 
[02:40:30]  On Wheel of Fortune, man  Yeah  On one of the rounds  One of the white girls  She says, oh, G  Up on the screen, right?  So the letter is there  So the G's up on the screen  So then they get to his turn  And they go, okay  We need a letter  And he's looking at the screen  And he goes, G  And he loses his turn  Because the letter's already up there  Oh, God  All right, guys  You suck, I suck  We all suck  All right, bye  Dennis, what's up, buddy?

[02:42:30]  Like Neil Diamond and stuff?  All right  That was great  Hey, Mike, what's up?  What's happening?  You're on the air  What's up?  Listen, how come I never see  Any African Americans  On that Who Wants to Be a Millionaire show?  I don't know  It's tough  It's tough  Also, I got a question  Wait, you didn't have an answer to that?  I figured you guys had an answer  You know they're not going to give brothers that kind of money, man  Come on  Well, you know, it just dawned on me last night  But also, ABC  You know that a guy lost on that show 
[02:43:00]  Because he couldn't finish this phrase  Duck, duck, blank  I hear that  I swear to you  Did you see that one?  Everyone is at home screaming  Let's go!  It's like the $100 question  Duck, duck, blank  And they even have Goose is one of the answers  Duck, duck, it's a drive-by  I'm letting someone in and fire me  Hold on, hold on  Go ahead  Bye, Mike  We got time for that  But they had like duck, duck  A, kitten 
[02:43:30]  Duck, duck  B, horse  C, goose  Or D, whale  Well, I'm kind of familiar with it  But I'm not sure  Well, I really don't think it's kitten  Horrendous  You know, they always have to make up this excuse  Why they got the answer  Well, you know, I was thinking about this  And I have two to choose from  I think duck or the goose  I'm going to say because once when I was a kid 
[02:44:00]  I had a pet duck  That it's going to be duck  If that's your final answer  And the other day  Now you've confused me  Wait  Ready for this one?  The other day a guy had to use a lifeline for this question  I swear to you  Blue  And yellow  Make the color  Oh my God  And then they obviously had orange, purple, green  Yes  And whatever 
[02:44:30]  He had to pull the audience  Your final answer  I just renamed that  Giving Idiots Money  That should be the name of that show  I want to go on  Amazing  And you want to try another wooden leg story?  The first one went horribly wrong  Yeah  Joey, what's up?  Who wants to be a millionaire?

[02:47:00]  Like a U-lock  No, so  You be quiet  I'll throw you in the fireplace, you bitch  Just don't let the train him  No, so he used to take it off like every night when he went to bed  So what I was going to do was seduce him to a hotel  And then steal his leg  So that he didn't have it  And I was going to say  Bitch, you're hopping mad now  Bitch, you're hopping  Uh-huh  Or I have a leg up on you  No, he really was not a nice person  Call Z100 with that story tomorrow  They would love to hear that  That's insane

[02:54:30]  Yes.  A lot of people say we've had a lot of good shows lately,  and they think it's because your penis is free.  Yes, it is.  Free at last, free at last.  Thank God Almighty, my penis is free at last.  I'm serious.  They're saying I think the reason you guys are doing so well lately  is because Anthony's penis is free.  Ah.  Oh, he can breathe.  Oh, breathe.  Amazing what a free penis will do for you.  Breathe, penis.  Here, here it is. 
[02:55:00]  Yes, calm down.  Calm down.  Oh, oh, oh, easy.  Easy.  Look at the scare spaz.  Relax, man.  Oh, yeah.  Put that thing away until the show is over, please.  More like...  Oh, I'm kidding. 
[02:55:30]  Oh, my goodness.  You know, we've done a lot of good stuff today,  but that could be the coolest thing of the day.  All right.  Nice use of the buttons there.  Nice use of the buttons.  That's my job.  Little job.  Anthony.  Hello.  What's up, buddy?  Oh, I'm getting inducted to the Hummer Club right now as we speak.  Hey.  That huge spaz hung up on me.  Well, what's his name, man? 
[02:56:00]  What?  What's his name?  Who's doing it to you?  Yeah.  Oh, you got me.  You got me, Dad.  Oh, yeah.  You got me.  Hello, people.  All right.  Oh, congratulations, Anthony.  Thank you.  All right, man.  Have fun.  Yeah, all right.  All right.  Hey, can I tell my wife to induct me?  Did she pop out that kid yet, John?  Yeah, man.  Yeah.  You're a father?  I'm a father.  Scary thought.  Really?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Don't do it.  Wait, wait.  I'm screwing up. 
[02:56:30]  I got to give you the party line.  Yes, it's the best thing that has ever happened to me.  Yeah.  I am so happy.  I want the kid before the wife.  Swear to you.  How do you mean that?  I don't feel like that's a little right.  Yeah, tell me about it, man.  Yeah, right.  And let me tell you something.  I do have a price, so I don't care.  Nah, sex changes after you have.  I don't care if I have a kid, though, man.  Yeah?  It's the same.  It's just a lot more lonely.  I'm telling you right now, man.  Sex changes after you have a kid.  Nothing else seems as tight. 
[02:57:00]  Come on.  It's a little challenge.  Oh, my God.  Let me tell my wife, though.  Honey, I am horny.  I mean, this is Tuesday night.  All right.  You're going to get some.  Take care of Chuck.  How do you go?  Ike, what's up?  Yeah, I was watching well last night, and there was like four signs for wow.  Yeah, I saw a few wow signs on you for all of you last night.  And if you look far in the back, there's a big sign that says Open Anthony Rules.  Oh, cool.  There you go.  When is The Rock going to be on? 
[02:57:30]  We want more on Sunday night at the pay-per-view.  The Rock will be here Thursday sometime after 5, we have been told.  All right, man.  Thanks for having me.  You guys suck.  All right, man.  Thank you.  We really should start playing What Did We Learn on the Open Anthony Show today, okay?  All right.  We love playing this game.  2-1-2-7-5-7-1-0-2-7.  A lot of things to choose from today, right, Ant?  Yes.  Make sure we cover all bases today.  Amy, what's up?  Hey, hello?  Yeah, what's going on?  Hey, this is proof that stupid people should be shot.  Why?  There's this bar in Jersey that you need to go to or check out on their website because 
[02:58:00]  they have live broadcasts on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  And they have, like, local bands that come, and they, you know, this one particular band  on Saturday night just does Metallica.  So we're there, and everyone's rocking, and mostly people who go to see Metallica, they're  headbangers.  They go to the...  So I turn around, and my boyfriend's hysterical laughing.  There's two people standing there, dirty dancing to Master of Puppets by Metallica.  My boyfriend couldn't help it just to take them by the strokes and just threw them into  the mosh pit, and they didn't know what the hell to do with themselves. 
[02:58:30]  Oh, wow.  You need to check it out.  Thursday, Fridays, and Saturdays, they're live.  All right.  Really cool.  Thank you.  I was feeling a little gentle toward the end of the show.  I think she deserved the train.  Remember that?  When it was as innocent as a little ping-pong game.  Now it's instead of guts being splattered by a few high-powered aerial weapons.  Aerial assault.  John, let's start it off.  What did you learn on the show today?  John!  I learned that Mark has nine lives, and he used about four of them today. 
[02:59:00]  He really did.  Jumping out of the way of cars and ambulances and buses and everything else.  He really did.  And the beauty of what Mark did today with MTV, unless MTV pusses out, they rerun TRL.  What time?  Does anyone know?  11.  No.  Yeah.  Someone find out before we go off the air, the exact time.  It'll be on again.  You'll be able to see Mark in the distance.  You'll be able to look out the window and see this huge wow sign in the middle of the traffic.  Yeah.  I couldn't find him on the news. 
[02:59:30]  I couldn't keep track of what station you guys were on.  Yeah.  You guys rock.  Thank you, man.  But the MTV thing, I mean, he's throughout the whole hour show.  It's not like it was a quick little 10-second Mark thing.  He was there pretty much every shot when they went to the studio.  We'll find out when it's on before we get off the air.  Joey, what's going on?  What's up, fellas?  All right.  I believe you keep getting better and better each day.  Oh, thanks.  We're trying.  But to tell you the truth, I'm pissing in my pants of what happened at CRL, but I can't watch it.  It's 9 o'clock.  Yeah, well. 
[03:00:00]  Until you see the 8.30 at 9 o'clock, it comes back on.  Yeah, we'll find out the exact time before we get off, but thank you.  You guys rock.  I think the new bosses have unleashed the Opie and Anthony show.  We're getting back to where we were, man.  Yeah.  I hope so.  Before all the restraints were put on us.  I tried getting in yesterday and requested no water night for Anthony to do a little song, but I couldn't get through.  Yeah.  Can you give it to me tonight?  No, we're just about done with the show, unfortunately.  Yes.  All right.  No problem, guys.  Take it easy.  Yeah, the new bosses took off those masks from the Silence of the Lambs that we had around for like six months. 
[03:00:30]  Muzzles.  They finally got all that crap off our bodies.  They used to wheel us in here on the hand truck.  Do your breastfeed, Senator.  Tuck in your nipples, didn't it?  But you guys don't know, for the last six months, we've been doing the show completely straight up.  Yeah.  On a board.  Strapped to a board.  Strapped to a board.  We just let our mouthpiece go so we can talk.  The dump button was actually connected to electrodes in our ass.  So that really hurt when he had to dump out.  All right. 
[03:01:00]  Let's get back to what are we doing on the show today.  Hold on, Rick.  Tim, what's going on?  What's going on, guys?  All right.  I learned today that unless you're Charles Bronson, you can't give a good Hummer.  There you go.  See you all, guys.  Very good.  Later.  We don't like explaining what we learned, but we don't have to explain that one.  Rick, when is TRL on?  Let's see.  Tonight at 8.30 is TRL Wannabes.  I'm not sure what that is, but TRL itself is at 9 p.m.  All right.  That's what Mark is definitely on. 
[03:01:30]  It's TRL.  9 o'clock MTV.  Look, we're giving MTV a huge plug.  I know.  So if you're in the production room trying to, like, cube out the wow signs, don't do  it.  We're going to have a lot of our listeners watching tonight.  All right?  All right.  Let's go to Chris.  Chris, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Frogger lives on interactive radio.  Very good, Chris.  Have a good one.  You suck.  All right.  Bill, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  How you doing, Anthony?  All right.  I learned that women shouldn't leave their clams out in the cold. 
[03:02:00]  That's true.  Learned that today.  You guys are the best.  You can make my days go by real quick.  Hey, thank you.  No one wants their clams freezing.  No, not at all.  John, you're next.  What's going on?  Yeah, hi.  I learned that the more I listen to you guys, the more I like you.  You guys are pretty cool.  And the more I listen to Mason in the morning, the more he sucks.  That's it.  All right.  Thank you.  Thanks, man.  Bye.  He's still there?  He speaks very highly of that guy.  I don't know.  Are they still doing that morning show?  I don't know.  TJ.  Yeah, today I learned. 
[03:02:30]  No, I'm serious.  I really don't know.  I don't know.  They are?  Oh, my God.  You think I'm kidding, Chuck?  No, that's why I'm laughing because I'm looking at your face and you're dead serious.  It's not a bit.  Are they still doing that?  I get up around 9.  I catch a 10, 15 train.  I don't know.  I really don't know what they're doing during the morning show here.  Yeah.  I have no clue.  I swear.  If you had more time in the morning, would you tune over?  Oh, no.  TJ.  Hey, guys.  Today I learned that Psycho Mark should be paid by the station without a doubt. 
[03:03:00]  He's already paid him.  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  And, guys, I'm going to Rumble.  I have a shirt that says The Rock Plays the Rusty Trombone.  Oh, cool.  Nice.  You guys are rocking.  All right, man.  Bye.  Bye.  Steve, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  How are you doing, guys?  I learned two things.  Yeah.  Black people shouldn't play the Wheel of Fortune.  And they shouldn't hang up pitches.  Have a good night.  All right.  I think we're going to rerun in the 2 o'clock hour tomorrow. 
[03:03:30]  The whole Earl getting really pissed because we abused him for his picture.  For his picture hanging that took two and a half days.  If you didn't hear it the other day, make sure you're listening 2 o'clock tomorrow or, you know, soon after that.  That is tough being a brother, man.  I'm telling you.  Adam.  Yeah, what's up, OB?  All right, what did you learn on the show today?  Today I learned that if Psycho Mark had wooden legs, he probably would have gotten killed by a truck.  Yeah.  Not been able to move as fast.  You know how many listeners called in going, oh, my God, I'm scared he's going to get run over.  Yeah, man, I can believe it, man.  I didn't get to see it, though. 
[03:04:00]  All right, man.  You guys suck.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  A lot of good ones today, Anthony.  Steve, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, fellas?  What's going on?  All right.  I learned that in order to truly enjoy your show, I got to convince my boss to install a TV in my work truck.  You guys are killing me, man.  Very good, man.  You guys are killing me.  All right.  Take it easy.  If you go home tonight, you'll be able to see some of the Psycho Mark.  Oh, I just pulled into my driveway.  Thanks a lot.  I think at 9 o'clock, TRL, MTV, you'll see some of the Psycho Mark craziness in the background with the wow sign. 
[03:04:30]  Cool.  All right, man.  All right.  Take it easy.  Thank you.  All right.  Bye-bye.  Bye.  There's so many others here.  Tom, what's going on?  How you doing?  I'm still laughing about the CBS FM from yesterday.  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.  Yeah.  Well, that's what we learned from him.  Okay.  Only a couple more here, and we got to step aside.  Mike, you're next.  What did you learn on the show today?  Oh, what's up, guys?  All right.  I learned that the show is not just for radio anymore. 
[03:05:00]  I learned that Anthony could be a good sidekick for Dr. Ruth on giving lessons on how to give hummus.  And I learned to always watch for live broadcasts on TV, because you never know what's going to happen.  Hallelujah.  Well, I'll tell you, you know, this job is, we need more people.  We're hoping.  I'm going to start getting out there.  We hope we spawn some other marks to do this whenever you see a live broadcast happening.  We can keep my eyes peeled for live broadcast. 
[03:05:30]  All right, man.  Thank you.  All right, guys.  Take it easy.  All it takes is a wow sign.  You see a report on the street.  You know, they're live.  You just pop on a wow sign.  We can call them Mark's Kids.  Mark's Kids.  Father Mark.  Spawning.  Spawning.  Other Psycho Marks.  Tim, what's up?  What did you learn on the show today?  Hey, what's up, guys?  I learned that not even TV is safe from Opie and Anthony.  All right.  All right, baby.  Yeah.  Ow.  Ow.  That hurt.  Jeremy.  Yeah. 
[03:06:00]  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned you should never stick hamsters in the grass.  You took the shoulder too bad.  I know.  That's something you should learn on your own.  Mom, guess what I found out today?  That's a little scary.  I should put hamsters up my ass.  I learned it on the radio.  Can you pull this one out, please?  All right.  Thank you.  Yep.  All right.  Bye.  What the heck is it?  Hey, Bill.  Yeah.  What did you learn on the show today?  I learned that L1A ain't afraid to say RCN on the radio.  Of course not.  Of course not. 
[03:06:30]  These people are listening today, man.  Very good.  You can even say Baba Booey as many times as you want.  We don't care.  What is that actually going to do?  Exactly.  I have no idea.  What channel is RCN?  Honestly, we're from Long Island and I couldn't even tell you.  Wait.  Let me think.  I thought there were internet.  I'll give them a free plug if I can remember there.  I don't even know.  It's not even worth it.  Forget it.  Thank you, Bill.  All right.  All right, man.  That was good.  Let's end with Jason, it looks like.  All right. 
[03:07:00]  Jason, what did you learn on the show today?  What's up, guys?  I learned that instead of being bored by the news, I can now watch and laugh along with you  guys.  See?  News has never been as fun as when you watch it with Hopi and Anthony.  I just want to let you guys know, too, I know you don't really watch WWF anymore, but  you might suspect some more nudity with the Miss Royal Rumble coming up.  Yeah, that's what I'm hearing.  I watched the little of all last night.  I'm not going to lie.  I watched the little last night.  We've got to get prepared for the Rockets coming in Thursday sometime after 5.  I'm just saying that we saw one pair of cans at Armageddon.  We've got to see at least two in the Royal Rumble. 
[03:07:30]  All right, man.  All right.  Thank you.  All right.  All right.  Well, we had a hell of a show today.  Hey, Craig.  Hey.  What's up?  You guys finally are in the right.  No more you suck sign-offs.  It's got to be syndication now.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  Syndication now.  You earned it.  Thank you, buddy.  You're only king of media.  When you boys are in control, you'll be syndicated.  I'm killing it, man. 
[03:08:00]  You boys don't know you're in front of CBS doing all kinds of hygiene.  Once again, we're messing with CBS TV.  How stupid are we?  All right.  Thank you, Craig.  Nice.  All right.  Well, the syndication has slowly started.  They're playing stuff from us back in Boston there.  Yeah.  I was reading some emails and stuff, and there were people on the phone lines talking about Boston.  All right.  Very happy to have our voices back up there, Opie.  There you go.  You're already multimedia.  You might as well go syndication, man.  We are multimedia.  You're multimedia, man.  The only multimedia radio station in New York. 
[03:08:30]  You know, there are days that you need the radio, the computer, and the TV just to listen  to this radio.  To be involved with the show.  So, all right.  Chuck, thanks for stopping by.  My pleasure, guys.  Opie, congratulations on finding Jesus, getting your eyesight back.  Yeah, thank you.  That was great.  I think that's helping the show, too.  Yeah.  I can actually see stuff.  You can actually see Anthony's penis now being free.  So, that's kind of cool.  Oh, yeah.  And we should give Chuck a plug.  He's trying out for the Radio Chick Show. 
[03:09:00]  What day?  Friday, man.  I'll be here sometime after 11, and Friday night, I'll be at Gotham Comedy Club.  All right.  Around 6.30, thanks.  Thank you, Chuck.  And we'll see you guys tomorrow, too.  Opie, what is it going to take for us to piss you off to the point where you're going  to change the station?  That's what I need to know.  Shove it.  Anthony, boy, it sure is easy to be a fag on this, though, isn't it?  That's going to be trouble.  Opie and Anthony, we've just received a PhD in stupidity.  1027, WNEW. </pre>
