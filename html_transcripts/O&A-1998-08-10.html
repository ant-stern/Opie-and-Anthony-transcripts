<pre> 1027 WNEW the Rock of New York with Days of the New and the Downtown. It's Opie and it's  Anthony. Hey! What's up? Hey! Whoa, wow, you're in a very good mood for a Monday. Well, I  had a nice relaxing weekend. Did you? Yes. What did you do? Anything fun? No, nothing  exciting, I guess. I tried to golf again. Ugh, I just suck! I don't know what it is.  I can't figure that game out. Most people can't figure it out, though. Yeah, but I 
[00:30]
 really can't. Yeah? Yeah, I'm a hacker. Are you one of those? I actually hurt my wrist  from hitting the ground too hard once. I felt like wheeing. I was like, ah, ah. Are you  one of those guys that carries around a six-pack when you golf? No, I didn't even drink. It  was too early. Really? It got over like six o'clock and you're golfing. I don't know  everything that you have to do on the weekends involves getting up very early. Do you want  to go fishing? We don't fish yet. All right, I'll see you like noon. No, no, no. We got 
[01:00]
 to go out at 4.30. Get out at like 2. You got to be out in the boat by 3. You got to  be fishing. Fish, no. You're so freaking tired. Yeah, you're exhausted, you sink a fish. Yeah,  so I got up early and golfed badly and hung out, crapped out. That's pretty bizarre. I  got to mark a lot of sleep. I got to mark this on the calendar. I think this is the  first time you've woke up before noon on a weekend in your whole life. Shut up. That 
[01:30]
 is not true. Come on. Tell me the last time you got up before noon on a weekend. Before  noon on a weekend. And why? Because you probably had to go do something that you didn't want  to do. I usually wake up early, but I stay in bed. Me and Jen like to sit and watch the  Home Improvement shows, laughing them. Home Improvement? Well, it's funny. You ever see  like interior motives? Well, I like interior motives. You do? Yes, I do. Today we're going  to learn how to do stenciling on the top of the panel of your walls and see what colors 
[02:00]
 really work. I was fixated on this show. He could be the gayest guy in the world. The host  of interior motives, I think it's on the Learning Channel, he has reached terminal gayness.  The gayest individual. There is no hope for that guy. None gayer. It's interesting because  the paper today asked a lot of straight people if they think homosexual people could change  their ways. And a lot of people think they could. Right. You got to see interior motives 
[02:30]
 and you tell me if that guy can be straight some day. No freaking way. Well, what did you  do? I went to Boston. No, I mean what did you do to get straight? Oh, did you? Yeah,  I'm a big fat homo. You got me. You got me. I see you went to Boston. Wow, you're too  quick for me. I'm a pickle smuggler. That's me. All right. I'm a butler. Very good. You  got me. Geez, I have no comeback for that one. All right. Very good. What did you do? This 
[03:00]
 weekend? Yeah. I just went to Boston to make sure my girlfriend wasn't dating. Was she  dating? Did you walk in on her in the middle of the act with some guy? No, I called her  on the way so I blew it. Well, I didn't want to be surprised so I went up there and made  sure she didn't date this weekend. She just opened the door and cracked it. Oh, Hopi,  what are you doing home? Sandy, are you coming back in the room? All right. So, I'm going 
[03:30]
 to go home. Yeah. Well, it was a pretty boring weekend actually. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we're  ready, Rock Factory. Yeah. It's 2-1-2-9-5-7-W-N-E-W. Wow, phones are really like crazy. Let's grab  one right here. Hi, N-E-W. Hello there. Yeah. What's up? What kind of name is Hopi? That's  a viable question. People probably want to know. It's a crappy name. I'm not happy with  it. Well, what does it mean? What's it short for? Um, tell the story. Well, I was the only 
[04:00]
 one in seventh grade that didn't have a nickname. It's not a radio name, by the way. It's been  my name since I was 12. Well, that's what I go as. My mom calls me Dopey, but besides  that, everyone else calls me Hopi. How do you feel? But put it this way. What's that?  I had three choices. They all, you know, ganged up on me in math class in seventh grade and  they said, hey kid, you don't have a nickname. We're going to give you one right now. Julie  Burson, by the way. So, they make me stand up in front of the class and then they decide  what they're going to call me. It was either going to be Four Eyes, Will Robinson from 
[04:30]
 Lawson Space. Warning! Or it was going to be Howdy freaking Duty. Oh my God. And then  they came up with Hopi and I'm like, trust me, I'll take Hopi out of the other choices.  Thank you. Good choice. My last name is Finnelli. I want to tell you, I had a few of those weird  names too. Listen, I want to tell you guys you're all right. I started out not liking  50 years old. I've been listening to NAW since I was one. Wow. I started out thinking 
[05:00]
 that this wasn't a good idea, but I'm changing my mind. Hey, thanks a lot. Thank you. That's  good work, guys. I appreciate it. Okay, bye. Bye. Hey, we're starting off on the right  foot today. Very good. Woo! Thank you. On the way we got Pearl Jam and Kiss next. 1027WNEW,  the Rock of New York, another track from Yield. That's Pearl Jam in hiding. Those guys coming  to the big town in September for a couple sold out shows. We might just have a few extra  tickets laying around the joint for you and when we get closer to the date, we'll let  you know about it, okay? Yeah. It's Hopi. It's Anthony. Hey, man. Hey, last night I 
[05:30]
 rented The Wedding Singer, finally. Yeah. I thought that was supposed to be a really  good movie. I haven't seen it, so I can't tell you. Oh. What's wrong with Adam Sandler?  Yeah. Yeah. I thought it was such a good movie and it was just released that I was going  to the video store three or four times a day, you know, just hoping to luck out and  have a copy on the shelf. Oh, new release? Yeah. No, forget it. Yeah. Not going to get  it. And it was bad? Put it this way, I'm in love with Drew Barrymore. If she wasn't in  the movie, I would think that movie would blow. She's pumping up a little too. I mean, 
[06:00]
 it wasn't a bad movie, but I was expecting Drew Barrymore's pump. What are you talking  about? You don't want to hear it. What are you talking about? I just want to get off  the subject, but. What are you talking about, Drew Barrymore's pumping up? I picked up  the National Enquirer, Monica Lewinsky on the cover, and I thought that the picture  of Joe Barrymore was Monica. Really? Look at her. Let's say. Oh, and now she's she's  pumping up. Oh, she's got cafeteria lady arms. Look at that. Looking like Drew Karen. Oh, 
[06:30]
 what happened to lovely Drew? She's eating. Oh, some reason. Oh, I'm depressed. Well,  anyway. Yeah, she was in that movie. Well, the wedding singer. I don't know. Just wasn't  as good as I thought it was going to be. Everyone was talking about the wedding singer, the  wedding singer, the you know, the 80s references, the 80s songs in the movie. That stuff was  cool, but the movie was kind of slow moving and boring and you still couldn't get it in  the video store. No, I got a theory about this. When a new release hits your video store, 
[07:00]
 it is the most sought after video. Yeah. And it doesn't matter how good the movie was in  theaters. It could be the worst movie it could have. It could have bombed in the theaters,  but because it's a new release in your video store, everyone has to go and get it. I don't  understand. I want to be the first one to see it. Yeah. I remember that, you know, bio  domes out. We got to get Polly Short's bio dome. That's a great movie. Super Mario Brothers.  I can't find it. Yeah. It was hard. I don't know. It's all right. It was just I was expected 
[07:30]
 better from Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore to be honest with you. Speaking of awful,  did you see HBO last night? Jerry Seinfeld? I purposely missed it because the reviews  on it were so bad. I should have, I should have saw it just because of that, but how  bad was it? You know what it reminds me of? You see those stories about the old miser  woman that was found in her house. She has millions of dollars, but she keeps using the  same old tea bag to make the cup of tea. That's what Jerry's doing. He made how much money 
[08:00]
 off of the Seinfeld show? Millions and millions. He's making tons of money off of this tour  that he did, the HBO special that he did last night, and it's the same old tea bag he's  using. So he didn't really have any new jokes or? No, but that was the whole thing. He went  into it saying, this is going to be my old act. I'm doing my old act. It's just tired.  It's old. He's been up in eight to 10 years, right? Yeah. You would think he'd have some 
[08:30]
 brand new observations and new angles on things by now. I don't know. What about these new  garbage pails? He's talking about his engagement like 10 years ago. I was engaged 10 years  ago. 10 years engagement. It's like a roller coaster ride. I heard it before, Jerry. Please.  Stop. But he's talking about stuff that's just old. Yeah. Like why does McDonald's have  to tell us how many burgers they sold? It doesn't anymore, really. It doesn't. It's just 
[09:00]
 like billions and billions served. It's not like I need a number? Okay, why don't you  just put McDonald's? We're doing very well. All right, Jerry. That was funny in the 80s.  Great. You might as well bring my act back if Jerry's going to get out there. I could  talk about tongue and cheeks like I did in the 80s. But it was the same. I mean, it might  as well have been why? Because it's Jerry and it's clean, that it's more funny. No, it's  just old hat already. That's too bad. How about those peanuts? Why does the pilot have 
[09:30]
 to tell you where he's going? We're taking off. We'll be cruising to 35,000 feet and  then we'll turn left at Cleveland. Okay, just get there. I'm not knocking on the cockpit  door saying I'm going to be eating these peanuts. Not all the peanuts. I'm going to save some  for the flight. Jerry, great. It was great when I was smoking pot and hanging out with  my friends. Yeah, they had some of the jokes in the paper and they were painful to read.  They're just old and kind of dated and everything. I'll have Jerry hang out today and read his 
[10:00]
 material from the papers for everybody. What's with these garbage pails? In the city, $600  for a garbage pail. One of they bulletproof? Yeah, we have to talk about that next actually.  Okay, got something for the show. I know it's Monday, but come on guys. If you got something,  call us. We'll be on the phone. We'll be on the phone. We'll be on the phone. We'll be  on the phone.

We'll be on the phone. We'll be on the phone. We'll be on the phone. We'll be on the phone.  Why did he have to tour this old crap? We all heard it a thousand times and as a matter of fact 
[11:30]
 I saw some of those jokes when he did it on the young comedian special in  1978 so some of that crap was 20 years old  I'm not kidding if any other comic did that they'd be shot  They go comedy prison you got a run me why didn't he get off the show take a break to write some new stuff and then tour  That I don't understand why you had to go around. Whoa, what's with these peanuts?  Yeah  You can't get it off the wall you gotta spray it and it moves down a foot at a time 
[12:00]
 Why won't people live in Florida? It's like the old people go there  Well, why do they do they reach an age where they feel like it just back their car out of the driveway without looking?  Actually, no, it was it was kind of dull last night watching that  Plus for the money you had to pay for the tickets you're expecting something new and different  Jerry Seinfeld was the funniest guy ever saw live without a doubt. I'll give that to him 
[12:30]
 I was 20 years ago. You say I saw him ten years ago and it was the same act from ten years ago  You're supposed to be this comedian and and create a person, you know, open your eyes  You've been in New York for a while now and come up with new stuff  Maybe maybe he can't get any new observation  All right, then take a little more time and get the act together get a polish that's all we're saying  All right  he can't get those quick witty observations being locked up in the most expensive hotels around the world and 
[13:00]
 You know, maybe maybe that just doesn't have it anymore. Maybe that's an option. All right, never know  Thanks, all right  There you go  Sam in New York says the funniest thing about last night's show was when somebody in the crowd hit Jerry one of those red laser  Lights. No, they did. Yeah, I thought it was on his suit and then like one on the side of his head  He was wishing they would have kept it there in his forehead  Now that episode of sign film George went to the up play and some guy could stick in the laser light 
[13:30]
 All right, so we got some big Floyd on the way seven married three  All right. I like people who will uh, you know confront our opinions and this  That's very cool. If you got something to add to the discussion today, give us a call  All right, what a two-seven WNEW where rock lives Bruce Springsteen talking heads and Aerosmith off the Armageddon soundtrack  What kind of love are you on on the way? We got the stones and third-eye blind next. It's Opie  It's Anthony. Hey doing well for a Monday Jay and Matt have sent us a fax. You guys haven't been fired yet 
[14:00]
 I think we're getting listeners because people are tuning in every day to see if we're getting here. Yeah, you think  I'm gonna be oh, that's good. I think that's a great marketing strategy. Actually  I don't be a lighting into any W to find out when Opie and Anthony will be fired  I see I see a lot of people especially on the instant feedback the same names, you know, Rebecca Rebecca from Jersey  She's hated us since we got here. Okay, and she's hating us every day 
[14:30]
 She hates us every day from three to seven when she's listening she is tuned in every ding-dong day  I don't know figure that out. All right. All right, I want to say hi to the faithful listeners of the program  We uh, we have about ten of you and we appreciate the support every day  We'll gain a few more sure as long as you guys start spreading the word for us. That would be nice  Your brother's on the line Joe. I was saying that the Drew Barrymore is like really hot and he disagrees  So hey, hey, what's up? Nothing. I rented the wedding singer this weekend 
[15:00]
 Yeah, and I don't understand the mentality. Hope you know what it is  You like Drew Barrymore because she's drew Barrymore cuz personally she's got a chin like Dudley do right?  She's reaching maximum density. She is she looks disgusting. I never thought she was nice looking  Truthfully if you had the choice, yeah between Drew Barrymore and Sandy  Who would you take I told Sandy this weekend drew all the way 
[15:30]
 Wait a minute drew in scream  Okay. Yeah, well that's that's the mentality in poison ivy. That was just hot because of what she was  That goes with the fantasy drew an ET I mean come on  Oh  You know, you know the best part of that movie was Steve Buscemi 
[16:00]
 And he's just like he's going me and my brother  Second only to Anthony plugging your CD at my wedding  Oh  Anthony and Joe's and his brother's wedding Joe was talking our CD to better  Like it's your day. It's your day  But I figured I had to get a shameless plug in  I think three 
[16:30]
 Man see you later gentlemen ladle  That's true. Yeah, I just I get so sick of the same  Toasts that you hear from people the best man and  Is very close to me. I forget what the hell plug plug our CD  You pull the CD out of your tux. That was classic some weddings. I mean, I've been to plenty just  Cringing through the toast the drunken business 
[17:00]
 What we see happy couple many years you've helped in love and shut up  Good drunk shut up. Let's move on to the chicken day  Bring on the food. Why does it take three four five hours to eat a meal?  Why do I have to dance in between courses?  I'm hammered here. I'm trying to just get some sustenance off of the shrimp cocktail 
[17:30]
 Not it's not doing anything to diffuse these Jack and coke  Oh  Well, we're off to a good start today we're having fun we guys talk about  Jerry spring around the way. Yeah  Yeah  a little observation with that and we got to talk about the garbage cans a little while and all very important issue here in New  York and Jay Leno wrestling and Yankees giving out free tickets today with their blood drive and this earth  Freaking plan. Oh, yeah, the big town is the best place in the world to live 
[18:00]
 Did you see in the paper really fast before we move on here Yankees that have had some great promotions this year  Yeah, they had the beanie baby promotion  Uh-huh. Did you see the picture in the daily news the real tough burly construction worker holding his cute little beanie baby that he got  At the Yankee game. I got a beanie baby for my kid. Yeah, he's holding a little swine  I don't know the names of these stupid things I could care less but there he is in the paper and all his glory holding this  Tiny little cute little beanie baby over days are getting a little ridiculous too 
[18:30]
 Now they got an add-in there's so many  Such a diversity such a melting pot here in New York that now everyone's got to have a day  So you get like, you know lay ocean clam day or something?  They're handing out things I don't even know what they are you go in there you get like a stick and some twine  Yeah, it's point of my giant day  What do you use it for?  Okay, you know today they had the blood drive you go down and you give blood yeah 
[19:00]
 And you get a free ticket for the game tonight with the twins. Yeah, that's exactly what you want to do to your fans  Make them nice and weak  Before they go through the Bronx to a Yankee game  You get all those energy you can get you need all the energy and strength  You can muster up to get from your car to the stadium  You ever see what happens to the weak zebra out on the plains? They're the ones that get it  You'll be singled out as the weakling  See that they could sense that it's like oh look at the guy with the cookie in his hand 
[19:30]
 He's drinking that little cup of juice  He must be blow a quart boy that that's just a mess waiting to happen tonight  55 games over 500 for the Yanks though. They're kicking ass  So alright third eye blind next day there one  Oh two seven WNEW where rock-glyphs stones from tattoo you and semi charm life from third eye blind  Sophie and Anthony for your Monday if you checked out a Springer lately now  There's a whole big thing about if they they've taken the violence out of it 
[20:00]
 They haven't taken it out his producers wanted him to cut down on the violence and fighting on the show  I think week to week it changes  Yes, so now he's trying to say that the violence is back in like the fights are back in they're not  They cut him out. They cut out the best parts know what they do because I was watching the other day when the fights start on stage  They showed the crowd reacted since like you like I want to see the fight. That's what you wanted to see  That's why everyone watched and that's why his ratings were so high 
[20:30]
 but now  They got a security guy that sits there right between the two people and if they even get up and start moving towards the guy  They break it up and yet switch the camera shot to Jerry or something and it sucks  It's like a watch it up porno movie with all the smut cut out  I'm not watching Jerry Springer for the the interaction between the guests, but the the  Snappy humor and wit of these people you want to see one sister clock another sister with over the head with a shoot  Yeah, that's what I that tune it in for you 
[21:00]
 You know what the most ridiculous part is if you look in the background of Jerry Springer a bookshelf with books on it  I think they use it as a security angle because they know people won't go near the books, but they're frightened of books  It's like a safety zone run to the books. Yeah, they're petrified  Stand is Jerry Springer obviously one of the hottest shows on TV now  Why do they even have to calm down the fights and stuff if this is what America wants to see then so be it  Let it happen. Let it fly. No, cuz there's 12 people that are very angry at the violence. It's bad 
[21:30]
 It's bad for the children Opie  so they have stationary with letterhead on it and they could write to sponsors and  Producers and they they get action. So 12 people decide yes  We the public should see or hear or watch no they know what's best for you  I find it comforting that I don't have to make any decisions for myself  I could sit back and let someone else decide what's good for me. It's easier that way. I find it. It's very relaxing 
[22:00]
 I don't know what I'm missing. So I don't even have the the freedom to make that choice anymore  So it's great for me. I've accepted it  As a practice I'm just gonna I'm gonna stick to we're all a bunch of lending to this society for the most part  Sheep following the Pied Piper and we're all gonna just like  Walk into the water or into the river or something  That's one person can say what what is good or bad for everyone else for everyone else 
[22:30]
 And people listen and people act and react to it. That's over speaking of Jerry Springer though  I love the security people there Steve  Big shaved head guy Steve  Steve can you move a little faster by the time you get on stage that that bleeds blonde bimbo hit that other girl ten times  In the face you were ten feet away from it  Well, they got away, you know  Let it get a few in and I'll casually saunter up there and pull off her weave  They make a look go but they let they allow me get a few shots of me. I stopped the fight 
[23:00]
 Yeah, because of certain people we don't see that anymore no, thank you  Thanks. Thank you for making the decisions for me and everyone else. We appreciate that hopefully someday  Maybe they'll pretty much say that you know, maybe your job out there is offensive  We'll have to take that away too. Well, they did what the sploog moppers  Yeah, and the strip clubs in Manhattan that no one you know a small group of people decided that you know  This is not good for our society. And do you think it stops there people? 
[23:30]
 Do you think it stops there that all the people go? Okay, he shut down all the the strip clubs in Manhattan good  Now it's done. We could sell off our our stationary and our little pens and our offices and I don't have any causes anymore  I'm just gonna go home. No now they got to find something else. There's always something else  They'll always move on to the next thing but that's why you can't let them get one thing  Yeah, one freedom goes boom Domino's so the interesting thing with the sex clubs in Manhattan 
[24:00]
 People are going I think that you know a lot of people are going, you know rent in men in Times Square is not cheap  That's true. So if people weren't going to these establishments  They would close down on their own because they wouldn't be able to afford their the rent but you hear the mayor's explanation  It's just the drug dealers and murderers that are upset about this  If you're upset you must want the way I mean I was in New York once with the drug dealers and murderers  He doesn't think that respectable people 
[24:30]
 Occasionally, maybe want to go to scores or flash dancers and sit down and have a beer with a few of your friends  If you do that, obviously you're running right out and you're gonna go into Central Park and rape someone, right?  That's too bad. Don't give them one freedom. Damn it. Very good. I hate more. They keep grabbing at you  All right. Oh on the way hooch by that band everything  And Peter Gabriel stay there one oh two seven WNEW where rock lives 
[25:00]
 One oh two seven WNEW the rock in New York brand new band on the music scene from Washington DC  That's the band everything and hooch up there supernatural see they know what's hooch mean in that song  If you figured it out yet, is it a chick? Is it booze? Is it we eat?  I think it's weed actually a guy just called up and he said you guys sound like you smoke pot before you show every afternoon  Smoke pot. Yeah a lot of people I even got one that said you guys sound like you two potheads  Yeah, some guy was saying we sound like a couple of potheads. We don't smoke pot anymore. No, I'd be bothered with it. I 
[25:30]
 Remember in school. Yeah, I just smoked some pot. Yeah. Yeah kind of made me never smoke it through  motivated  Through a carrot. Yeah. No, there's always like a friend though that had some wacky thing  D you got to hollow out an apple  Yeah, and then you put some tin foil in it for a bowl and poke some holes in it  You'd smoke pot out of an apple 
[26:00]
 The best was smoking pot through a beer can yeah  I've been in half you put a hole in the middle and get that thing  How are you thinking?  Well, you get bored with you know  Engineers couldn't think this stuff up and these guys smoking weed all day  Come up with new and innovative ways to smoke Joe dude, you can smoke it out of your faucet  Look, you just unscrew your kitchen sink faucet. It's already got the screen in it. Yeah 
[26:30]
 School was dedicated my school anyway where I was to just finding wheat in the morning you'd go in find your guy  He'd be like you got some joints  Yeah, and he'd hand you this Marlboro box and you flip it open and it's full of doobies and you pick like  Yeah, look at this pin. It's too thick. That's a fatty. Let me grab that  How much up the dawn price for weed for a billion years? It's a buck. I 
[27:00]
 Got a buck  dime dime  Nickel or lunch money, but yeah, I ate yesterday and then you smoked the tube and you're like, I wish I had that buck  I'm hungry. I could really use one of those big soft pretzels in a coke right now  Well those giant cookies. Yeah the cafeteria saved the roads  Did you smoke it down till your fingernails are orange? Right? Well, yeah, then we get burnt, dude  Pass it over here and you just have to drop it in the palm of his hand 
[27:30]
 Yeah  I got it. I got beat up once for throwing our roach away. You always got beat up cuz I thought I was done like  A few more it's on that. Where'd you throw it?  Somewhere oh man, and they'd be on their hands and knees trying to find the road  Oh for you  You could smoke that down and not think guys that used to smoke it through a Whipple ball bat just cuz it you know  They thought it was cool. I didn't realize early enough in my life that it was just 
[28:00]
 not I was  Totally unmotivated when I smoked weed and it totally ruined my high school career  Because I would smoke in the morning and go over my friend's house and  Watch cartoons lay on the floor and watch cartoons and period after period would go by and I just wasn't there  And then after I was like you missed social studies 30 days straight  Yeah, I didn't want to go I hadn't been there in a while. I was gonna get in trouble
