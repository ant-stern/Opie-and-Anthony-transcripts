<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with Opie and Anthony recounting their weekends: Opie's frustrating golf outing and Anthony's trip to Boston to check on his girlfriend's fidelity.  This transitioned into a discussion about the show *Interior Motives* and speculation about its host's sexuality, peppered with rapid-fire jokes and puns.

A caller's inquiry about Opie's name led to a story about his seventh-grade nickname.  The hosts then launched into a scathing review of *The Wedding Singer*, criticizing Adam Sandler's performance and commenting on Drew Barrymore's weight.  Their critique extended to Jerry Seinfeld's recent HBO special, which they deemed unfunny and repetitive, sparking a debate with several callers who either supported or challenged their assessment.  The conversation then veered into a satirical discussion of absurd New York City initiatives, such as excessively expensive garbage cans.

Further calls included a listener defending Jerry Seinfeld and a call from Opie's mother expressing disapproval of certain show segments. The conversation broadened to cover the censorship of violence on *Jerry Springer* and the closure of Manhattan strip clubs.  The hosts then shared anecdotes about their past marijuana use, detailing various smoking methods.  The show wrapped up with a discussion about unusual Yankees promotional events, a brief "library book ordering" segment, and a final chat about upcoming events and the hosts' upcoming softball game.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York, with Days of the New and the Downtown.  It's Opie and it's A.  Hey!  What's up?  Hey!  Whoa, wow, you're in a very good mood for a Monday.  Well, I had a nice relaxing weekend.  Did you?  Yes.  What'd you do, anything fun?  No, nothing exciting, I guess.  I tried to golf again.  Oh, I just suck!  I don't know what it is.  I can't figure that game out.  Most people can't figure it out, though. 
[00:00:30]  Yeah, but I really can't.  Yeah?  Yeah, I'm a hacker.  I actually hurt my wrist from hitting the ground too hard once.  I'm like, poing!  Like, ah!  Ah!  Are you one of those guys that carries around a six-pack when you golfs?  No, I didn't even drink.  It was too early.  Really?  It got up at like 6 o'clock and you're golfing.  How come everything that you have to do on the weekends involves getting up very early?  You want to go, well, I'm finishing!  All right, and I'll see you like noon.  No, no, no. 
[00:01:00]  No, we got to get up at 4.30.  Get up at like 2.  You got to be out in the boat by 3.  You got to be fishing.  And then by 9 o'clock, you're so freaking tired.  Yeah, you're exhausted.  You think of fish.  Yeah, so then I got up early and golfed badly and, yeah, hung out, crapped out.  That's pretty bizarre.  I got a lot of sleep.  I got to mark this on the calendar.  I think this is the first time you've woke up before noon on a weekend in your whole life.  Shut up! 
[00:01:30]  That is not true.  Come on.  Tell me the last time you got up before noon on a weekend.  Before noon on a weekend?  And why?  Because you probably had to go do something that you didn't want to do.  I usually wake up early, but I stay in bed.  Okay.  Me and Jen, like, sit and watch the home improvement shows and laugh at them.  Home improvement?  And stuff.  Well, it's funny.  You ever see, like, interior motors?  Well, I like interior motors.  You do?  Yes, I do.  Today we're going to learn how to do stenciling on the top of the panel of your walls and see what colors really work. 
[00:02:00]  Like, I was fixated on this show.  He could be the gayest guy in the world.  The host of Interior Motives, I think it's on the Learning Channel, is, he has reached terminal gayness.  No.  He's the gayest individual.  There is no hope for that guy.  None gayer.  It's interesting because the paper today asked a lot of straight people if they think homosexual people could change their ways.  And a lot of people think they could.  Right.  You've got to see interior motives, and you tell me if that guy can be straight someday. 
[00:02:30]  No freaking way.  Well, what did you do?  I went to Boston.  No, I mean, what did you do to get straight?  Oh.  Or did you?  Yeah, Anthony, I'm a big fat homo.  You got me.  Oh, you got me.  All right, so you went to Boston.  Wow, you're too quick for me.  I'm a pickle smuggler.  That's me.  All right.  Yeah, I'm a butler.  Very good, Anthony.  You got me.  Wow, you got me.  Jeez, I have no comeback for that one. 
[00:03:00]  All right.  All right, very good.  What did you do?  This weekend?  Yeah.  Oh, all right.  I just went to Boston to make sure my girlfriend wasn't dating.  Was she dating?  Did you walk in on her in the middle of the act with some guy?  No, I called her on the way, so I blew it.  Well, I didn't want to be surprised, so I went up there and made sure she didn't date this weekend.  She just opened the door a cracker.  Oh, Hopi, what are you doing home?  Sandy, are you coming back in the room?  All right. 
[00:03:30]  So, it was a pretty boring weekend, actually.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Well, we're ready, Rock.  Fact 9 is 212-957-WNEW.  Wow, phones are running like crazy.  Let's grab one right here.  Hi, NEW.  Hello there.  Yeah, what's up?  What kind of name is Hopi?  That's a viable question.  People probably want to know.  It's a crappy name.  I'm not happy with it.  Well, what does it mean?  What's it short for?  Um, go ahead, tell the story.  Well, I was the only one in 7th grade that didn't have a nickname. 
[00:04:00]  It's not a radio name, by the way.  It's been my name since I was 12.  Well, that's what I go as.  My mom calls me Dopey, but besides that, everyone else calls me Opie.  I know how you feel.  But put it this way.  What's that?  I had three choices.  They all, you know, ganged up on me in math class in 7th grade, and they said,  Hey, kid, you don't have a nickname.  Hey, we're going to give you one right now.  Julie Burstyn, by the way.  So they make me stand up in front of the class, and then they decide what they're going to call me. 
[00:04:30]  It was either going to be Four Eyes, Will Robinson from Longton Space.  Warning.  Or it was going to be Howdy Freaking Duty.  Oh, my God.  And then they came up with Opie, and I'm like, trust me, I'll take Opie out of the other choices.  Thank you.  Good choice.  My man's name is Spinelli.  I want to tell you, I had a few of those weird names, too.  Listen, I want to tell you guys, you're all right.  I started out not liking you.  I'm 50 years old.  I've been listening to NEW since I was one.  Wow.  So anyway, I started out thinking that this wasn't a good idea, but I'm changing my mind. 
[00:05:00]  Hey, thanks a lot.  Thanks, man.  Keep up the good work, guys.  I appreciate it.  Okay, bye.  Bye.  Hey, we're starting off on the right foot today.  Very good.  Woo!  Thank you.  On the way, we've got Pearl Jam and Kiss next.  1027-WNEW, the Rock of New York, another track from Yield.  That's Pearl Jam in hiding.  Those guys coming to the big town in September for a couple sold-out shows.  We might just have a few extra tickets laying around the joint for you, and when we get  closer to the date, we'll let you know about it, okay?  Yeah.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony. 
[00:05:30]  Hey, man.  Hey, last night, I rented The Wedding Singer, finally.  Yeah.  I thought that was supposed to be a really good movie.  I haven't seen it, so I can't tell you.  Ugh.  That's wrong with Adam Sandler.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I thought it was such a good movie, and it was just released, that I was going to the  video store three or four times a day, you know, just hoping to luck out and have a copy  on the shelf.  A new release?  Yeah.  Forget it.  Yeah.  You're not going to get it.  And it was bad?  Put it this way.  I'm in love with Drew Barrymore.  If she wasn't in the movie, I would think that movie would blow. 
[00:06:00]  She's plumping up a little, dude.  I mean, it wasn't a bad movie, but I was expecting Drew Barrymore's pump it up.  You don't want to hear it.  What are you talking about?  I just want to get off the subject, but...  What are you talking about Drew Barrymore's pump it up?  I picked up the National Enquirer.  All right.  It's got Monica Lewinsky on the cover, and I thought that the picture of Drew Barrymore  was Monica.  Really?  Look at her.  Look, see?  Oh!  This is how she used to look, and now she's plumping up.  Oh, she's got cafeteria lady arms. 
[00:06:30]  Look at that.  She's looking like Drew Carey.  Oh!  What happened to the lovely Drew?  She's eating.  For some reason.  Oh, I'm depressed.  Oh, well.  Anyway.  Well, yeah.  She was in that movie.  Well, The Wedding Singer, I don't know.  It just wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be.  Everyone was talking about The Wedding Singer.  The Wedding Singer, you know, the 80s references, the 80s songs in the movie.  That stuff was cool, but the movie was kind of slow-moving and boring.  And you still couldn't get it in the video store?  No.  I've got a theory about this. 
[00:07:00]  What?  When a new release hits your video store, it is the most sought-after video.  Yeah.  And it doesn't matter how good the movie was in theaters.  It could be the worst movie.  It could have bombed in the theaters, but because it's a new release in your video store, everyone has to go and get it.  I don't understand that.  I want to be the first one to see it.  Yeah.  I remember that, you know.  Oh, Biodome's out.  We've got to get Pauly Shore's Biodome.  That's a great movie.  Super Mario Brothers.  I can't find it.  Yeah. 
[00:07:30]  It was awful.  It was hard.  I don't know.  It was all right.  I was expecting better from Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore, to be honest with you.  Speaking of awful, did you see HBO last night, Jerry Seinfeld?  I purposely missed it because the reviews on it were so bad.  I should have saw it just because of that, but terrible.  How bad was it?  You know what it reminds me of?  You see those stories about the old miser woman that was found in her house.  She has millions of dollars, but she keeps using the same old tea bag to make the cup of tea. 
[00:08:00]  Yeah.  That's what Jerry's doing.  He made how much money off of the Seinfeld show?  Millions to millions.  He's making tons of money off of this tour that he did, the HBO special that he did last night.  And it's the same old tea bag he's using.  Bloop, bloop, bloop.  So he didn't really have any new jokes or...  No, but that was the whole thing.  He went into it saying, this is going to be my old act.  I'm doing my old act.  It's just tired.  It's old.  He's been about to stand up in eight to ten years, right?  Yeah.  You would think he'd have some brand new observations and new angles on things by now. 
[00:08:30]  Huh?  I don't know.  What about these new garbage piles?  Ugh.  Ugh.  He's talking about his engagement like ten years ago.  Yeah.  I was engaged ten years ago.  Ten years engagement.  It's like a rollercoaster.  Oh, I heard it before, Jerry.  Please stop.  Oh, man.  But he's talking about stuff that's just old.  Yeah.  Like, why does McDonald's have to tell us how many burgers they sold?  Well, it doesn't anymore, really.  It doesn't.  It says like billions and billions served. 
[00:09:00]  It's not like, I need a number?  Okay, why don't you just put McDonald's?  We're doing very well.  All right, Jerry.  Yeah, that was funny in the eighties.  Great.  I might as well bring my act back if Jerry's going to get out there.  I could talk about tongue and chicks like I did in the eighties.  But it was the same.  I mean, it might as well have been.  Why?  Because it's Jerry and it's clean?  Yeah.  That it's more funny?  Yeah.  No, it's just old hat already.  That's too bad.  How about those peanuts? 
[00:09:30]  Why does the pilot have to tell you where he's going?  We're taking off.  We'll be cruising to 35,000 feet.  And then we'll turn left at Cleveland.  Okay, just get there.  I'm not knocking on the cockpit door saying, I'm going to be eating these peanuts.  Not all the peanuts.  I'm going to save some for later.  All right, Jerry.  Great.  It was great when I was like smoking pot and hanging out with my friends.  Yeah, they had some of the jokes in the paper and they were painful to read.  Yeah, they're just old and kind of dated and everything.  Maybe we'll have Jerry hang out today and read his material from the papers for everybody. 
[00:10:00]  What's with these garbage pails?  In the city, $600 for a garbage pail.  Yeah, we have.  What are they, bulletproof?  Yeah, we have to talk about that next, actually.  Okay, got something for the show.  I know it's Monday, but come on, guys.  If you got something, give us a call.  212-757-1027.  And the instant feedback is set up and ready to go, too.  WNAW.com.  Click on it and say something to us.  You'll get it instantly.  All right, and we got Sting next.  Stay there.  Yeah, I'm curious to know what everybody else thought of the Jerry Seinfeld thing on HBO last night. 
[00:10:30]  I thought it was kind of dull.  If you've got an opinion, you're in your office in front of the computer, email us at WNAW.com.  We have our instant feedback.  Hit us with that.  All right, very cool.  And we'll read some of that on the air, right?  Yeah.  Here's Sting on 1027-WNAW, the Rock of New York.  1027-WNAW, where Rock lives with NXS.  It's Opie and Anthony, and we got someone upset with us on the phone lines.  What?  Your comments about Jerry Seinfeld.  Yo, what do you got?  I'm just a little upset with you guys knocking Jerry Seinfeld.  Oh, please. 
[00:11:00]  Come on.  Come on.  Even though it's an old vacuum stuff, you still got to respect him.  But he didn't have to do that.  Why did he have to go on tour and do his old stuff?  It's like I said, like the miser lady using the teabag for the 20th time, and she's got a million bucks in her mattress.  I understand that, but he was doing his show for 10 years, and everyone loved that, you know?  And then he missed it.  All right, then he should have taken a little...  He leaves his show, and he still wants to do his stand-up.  People want to see it.  No, so to get right new material and then tour that.  Why did he have to tour this old crap?  We all heard it a thousand times. 
[00:11:30]  And as a matter of fact, I saw some of those jokes when he did it on the Young Comedian special in 1978.  Get out of here.  So some of that crap was 20 years old.  Get out of here.  I'm not kidding.  If any other comic did that, they'd be shot.  No shit.  They'd go to comedy prison.  You got to...  I mean, why didn't he get off the show, take a break to write some new stuff, and then tour that?  I don't understand why he had to go around,  Whoa, what's with these peanuts?  Yeah, I hear you.  How about the hair in the shower?  You can't get it off the wall.  You got to spray it, and it moves down a foot at a time. 
[00:12:00]  Oh, why do old people live in Florida?  It's like the old people go there.  Why do they...  Do they reach an age where they feel like they just backed their car out of the driveway without looking?  But you still appreciate it, right?  No.  You don't?  Actually, no.  It was kind of dull last night watching that.  Yeah.  And plus, for the money you had to pay for the tickets, you were expecting something new and different.  Yeah, yeah.  Come on.  I mean, he should have just...  I'll be honest.  I'll be honest.  Jerry Seinfeld was the funniest guy I ever saw live, without a doubt. 
[00:12:30]  I'll give that to him.  That was 20 years ago, you're saying?  No.  I saw him 10 years ago, and it was the same act from 10 years ago.  You're supposed to be this comedian and creative person.  You know, open your eyes.  You've been in New York for a while now and come up with new stuff.  I hear you.  That's all we're saying?  Maybe he can't get any new observations being held up.  Maybe he's doing his show for too long.  It's all on his show.  All right.  Then take a little more time and get the act together and get it polished.  That's all we're saying.  All right.  He can't get those quick, witty observations being locked up in the most expensive hotels 
[00:13:00]  around the world.  In London.  You know, maybe he just doesn't have it anymore.  Maybe that's an option.  All right.  Never know.  All right, fellas.  Thanks a lot.  All right, brother.  Thanks a lot, guys.  Peace.  Well, there you go.  Sam in New York says the funniest thing about last night's show was  when somebody in the crowd hit Jerry with one of those red laser lights real quick.  No, they did.  Yeah, I saw it.  It was on his suit and then, like, went on the side of his head.  He was wishing they would have kept it there on his forehead.  You know that episode of Seinfeld where George went to the play and some guy could stick 
[00:13:30]  in the laser light right on his forehead?  All right.  Well, we got some big Floyd on the way.  Seven Mary Three.  All right.  I like people who will, you know, confirm our opinions and discuss them.  That's very cool.  If you got something to add to the discussion today, give us a call.  All right.  1027-WNEW, where rock lives.  Bruce Springsteen, Talking Heads, and Aerosmith off the Armageddon soundtrack.  What kind of love are you on?  On the way, we got the Stones and Third Eye Blind next.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  Hey.  Doing well for a Monday. 
[00:14:00]  Jay and Matt have sent us a fax.  You guys haven't been fired yet?  I think we're getting listeners because people are tuning in every day to see if we're getting fired.  We're still here.  Yeah.  You think?  Oh, that's good.  I think that's a great marketing strategy, actually.  Keep tuning in to N.E.W. to find out when Opie and Anthony will be fired.  I see a lot of people, especially on the instant feedback, the same names.  You know?  Rebecca.  Rebecca from Jersey.  She's hated us since we got here.  Okay.  And she's hating us every day. 
[00:14:30]  She hates us every day from 3 to 7 when she's listening.  She is tuned in every ding-dong day.  Oh, nice.  Figure that out.  All right.  All right.  I want to say hi to the faithful listeners of the program.  We have about 10 of you, and we appreciate the support.  Every day we'll gain a few more.  Sure.  As long as you guys start spreading the word for us, that would be nice.  Mm-hmm.  Your brother's on the line.  Joe.  Well, I was saying that Drew Barrymore is, like, really hot, and he disagrees.  Joey!  Hey.  What's up? 
[00:15:00]  Nothing.  I rented the wedding singer this weekend.  Yeah.  And I don't understand the mentality, Opie.  You know what it is?  You like Drew Barrymore because she's Drew Barrymore, because personally, she's got a chin like Dudley  Do-Right, and she's reaching maximum density.  She looks disgusting.  I never thought she was nice looking.  But truthfully, if you had the choice between Drew Barrymore and Sandy, who would you take?  I told Sandy this weekend.  Drew, all the way.  You got it.  You got it. 
[00:15:30]  You can't be serious.  Wait a minute.  Drew in Scream.  Okay.  Yeah.  Well, that's the mentality.  Drew in Poison Ivy.  That was just hot because of what she was doing.  That's the mentality, though.  It's exactly.  And that goes with the fantasy.  Drew in E.T.  I mean, come on.  Drew in E.T.  That was the last time she looked good.  Uh-oh.  All right, Joe.  You know what the best part of that movie was?  Uh-huh.  Steve Buscemi.  Yeah, he was.  I love Buscemi.  He was killer.  He was killer. 
[00:16:00]  He was the best man, Anthony, and he's just like, he's good in everything.  He's good in everything.  He's going, me and my brother, you know, he's talking about hunters they picked up in Mexico  and stuff.  Second only to Anthony plugging your CD at my wedding.  Yeah, he did.  Oh, jeez.  Anthony at Joe's, at his brother's wedding, Joe, was plugging our CD to Venom World.  I had to give the toast.  It's like, it's your day.  It's your day.  I gave the toast, but I figured I had to get a shameless plug-in for the RCD.  How many sales did you get?  I think three.  I think you owe me some royalties for that. 
[00:16:30]  All right, man.  See you later, gentlemen.  Later.  Bye.  Too funny.  That's true.  Yeah, so I just, I get so sick of the same toast that you hear from people, the best  men, and friends are very close to me, so I figure, what the hell, I'll plug our CD.  You pull the CD out of your tux.  That was classic.  Some weddings, I mean, I've been to plenty, just cringing through the toast, the drunken best  man, and we want to wish you a happy couple many years of health and love, and shut up. 
[00:17:00]  You're drunk.  Shut up.  It's a bad thing.  Come on, let's move on to the chicken dance.  We need this.  Bring on the food.  God, why does it take three, four, five hours to eat a meal?  Yeah.  Why do I have to dance in between courses?  What is it?  I'm hammered here.  I'm trying to just get some sustenance off of the shrimp cocktail. 
[00:17:30]  It's not doing anything to diffuse these Jack and Cokes.  Too true.  Yeah.  All right.  Well, we're off to a good start today.  We're having fun.  We've got to talk about Jerry Springer on the way.  Yeah.  Yeah, a little observation with that.  And we've got to talk about the garbage cans a little while.  Oh, very important issue here in New York.  And Jay Leno wrestling and Yankees giving out free tickets today with their blood drive.  And this earth, how freaking planet are we on? 
[00:18:00]  The big town is the best place in the world to live.  Did you see in the paper really fast before we move on here, Yankees have had some great  promotions this year.  Yeah.  They had the Beanie Baby promotion.  Uh-huh.  Did you see the picture in the Daily News, the real tough, burly construction worker holding  his cute little Beanie Baby that he got at the Yankee game?  I got a Beanie Baby for my kid, yeah.  He's holding a little swan, I don't know the names of these stupid things, I could care  less, but there he is in the paper in all his glory holding this tiny little cute little  Beanie Baby.  Well, the days are getting a little ridiculous, too, because now they've got to add in. 
[00:18:30]  There's so many, such a diversity, such a melting pot here in New York that now everyone's  got to have a day.  So you get like, you know, Laotian Clam Day or something.  They're handing out things, I don't even know what they are.  You go in there, you get like a stick and some twine.  Yeah.  It's Quinto Bajar's Day.  What do you use it for?  I get it.  You know, today they had the blood drive.  You go down and you give blood. 
[00:19:00]  Yeah.  And you get a free ticket for the game tonight with the Twins.  Yeah.  That's exactly what you want to do to your fans.  Make them nice and weak before they go through the Bronx to a Yankee game.  You need all those energy you can get.  You need all the energy and strength you can muster up to get from your car to the stadium.  You ever see what happens to the weak zebra out on the plains?  They're the ones that get it.  You'll be singled out as the weak link.  They see that.  They can sense that.  It's like, oh, look at the guy with the cookie in his hand. 
[00:19:30]  Let's attack him.  He's drinking that little cup of juice.  He must be lower court.  Boy, that's just a mess waiting to happen tonight.  55 games over 500 for the Yankstones.  They're kicking ass.  Absolutely amazing.  All right.  Third Eye Blind next.  Stay there.  1027 WNEW where Rock Live Stones from Tattoo You and Semi Charm Life from Third Eye Blind.  It's Opie and Anthony for your Monday.  Have you checked out Springer lately?  Now, there's a whole big thing about if they've taken the violence out of it. 
[00:20:00]  They haven't taken it out.  His producers wanted him to cut down on the violence and fighting on the show.  I think week to week it changes.  Yeah.  So now he's trying to say that the violence is back in.  Like the fights are back in.  They're not.  They cut them out.  They cut out the best parts.  You know what they do?  Because I was watching the other day.  When the fights started on stage, they showed the crowd reacting to the fights.  You're like, ah, I want to see the fights.  That's what you wanted to see.  That's why everyone watched and that's why his ratings were so high. 
[00:20:30]  But now they've got a security guy that sits there right between the two people.  And if they even get up and start moving towards the guy, they break it up.  And yeah, switch the camera shot to Jerry or something.  And it sucks.  It's like watching a porno movie with all the smut cut out.  I'm not watching Jerry Springer for the interaction between the guests.  Right.  The snappy humor and wit of these people.  You want to see one sister clock another sister over the head with a chute.  Yeah. 
[00:21:00]  That's what I tune in for.  You know what the most ridiculous part is?  If you look in the background of Jerry Springer, there's a bookshelf with books on it.  I think they use it as a security angle because they know people won't go near the books.  But they're frightened of books.  It's like a safety zone.  Run to the books.  Yeah.  They're petrified.  What I don't understand is Jerry Springer, obviously one of the hottest shows on TV now.  Why do they even have to calm down the fights and stuff?  If this is what America wants to see, then so be it.  Let it happen. 
[00:21:30]  Let it fly.  No, because there's 12 people that are very angry at the violence.  It's bad.  It's bad for the children, Opie.  So they have stationery with letterhead on it.  And they could write to sponsors and producers.  And they get action.  So 12 people decide what we, the public, should see or hear or watch.  Oh, they know.  They know what's best for you.  I find it comforting that I don't have to make any decisions for myself.  I could sit back and let someone else decide what's good for me. 
[00:22:00]  It's easier that way.  I find it's very relaxing.  I don't know what I'm missing.  So I don't even have the freedom to make that choice anymore.  So it's great for me.  I've accepted it as a practice that I'm just going to, I'm going to stick to.  We're all a bunch of lemmings in this society for the most part.  Sheep.  Following the Pied Piper.  And we're all going to just like walk into the water.  Walk off a cliff or into the river or something.  Because one person can say what is good or bad.  For everyone else. 
[00:22:30]  For everyone else.  And people listen and people act and react to it.  That's the developer.  Speaking of Jerry Springer, though, I love the security people there.  Steve.  Yeah.  Big shaved head guy, Steve.  Hey, Steve, can you move a little faster?  By the time you get on stage, that bleached blonde bimbo hit that other girl ten times in the face.  You were ten feet away from it.  Well, they got away, you know.  Let her get a few in and then I'll casually saunter up there and pull off her weave.  They make it look good, but they allow them to get a few shots before they stop the fight. 
[00:23:00]  But, yeah, because of certain people, we don't see that anymore.  No.  Thank you.  Thank you for making the decisions for me and everyone else.  We appreciate that.  Hopefully someday maybe they'll pretty much say that, you know, maybe your job out there is offensive.  We'll have to take that away, too.  Well, they did.  What?  The splooge moppers?  Yeah.  The strip clubs in Manhattan.  Someone, you know, a small group of people decided that, you know, this is not good for our society. 
[00:23:30]  And do you think it stops there, people?  Do you think it stops there that all the people go, okay, he shut down all the strip clubs in Manhattan.  Good.  Now it's done.  We could sell off our stationery and our little pens and our offices and I don't have any causes anymore.  I'm just going to go home.  No.  Now they've got to find something else.  There's always something else for these people.  They'll always move on to the next thing.  But that's why you can't let them get one thing.  Yeah.  One freedom goes, boom, dominoes.  Well, the interesting thing with the sex clubs in Manhattan, people are going. 
[00:24:00]  I think that, you know, a lot of people are going.  You know, rent in Times Square is not cheap.  That's true.  So if people weren't going to these establishments, they would close down on their own because they wouldn't be able to afford the rent.  But you hear the mayor's explanation.  It's just the drug dealers and murderers that are upset about this.  If you're upset, you must want the way Manhattan was and New York was with the drug dealers and murderers.  He doesn't think that respectable people occasionally maybe want to go to scores or flash dancers and sit down and have a beer with a few of your friends. 
[00:24:30]  If you do that, obviously you're running right out and you're going to go into Central Park and rape someone.  Right.  That's too bad.  Don't give them one freedom.  Damn it.  Very good.  They take more.  They keep grabbing at you.  All right.  Oh, on the way, Hooch by that band, Everything.  Who's got the Hooch?  And Peter Gabriel.  Stay there.  1027 WNEW where rock lives. 
[00:25:00]  1027 WNEW, the rock in New York.  Brand new band on the music scene from Washington, D.C.  That's the band, Everything.  And Hooch off their supernatural seat, eh?  Now, what's Hooch mean in that song?  Have you figured it out yet?  Is it a chick?  Is it booze?  Is it weed?  I think it's weed.  Actually, a guy just called up and he said, you guys sound like you smoke pot before your show every afternoon.  Smoke pot?  Yeah.  A lot of people.  I even got one that said you guys sound like you two potheads.  Yeah. 
[00:25:30]  Some guy was saying we sound like a couple of potheads.  We don't smoke pot anymore.  No.  I can't be bothered with it.  I remember in school, I used to smoke some pot.  Yeah.  It kind of made me unmotivated.  You ever smoke it through a carrot?  Through a carrot?  Yeah.  No, it was always like a friend, though, that had some wacky thing.  Gee, you got to hollow out an apple.  Yeah, and then you put some tinfoil in it for a bowl and poke some holes in it.  You'd smoke pot out of an apple. 
[00:26:00]  What?  The best was smoking pot through a beer can.  Yeah.  You bend it in half.  You put a hole in the middle.  You can't dent that thing.  What the hell are you thinking?  What do you get bored with?  Engineers couldn't think this stuff up, and these guys are smoking weed all day.  You had to come up with new and innovative ways to smoke dope.  Dude, you could smoke it out of your faucet.  Look, you just unscrew your kitchen sink faucet, and it's already got the screen in it.  Yeah, you just pack it in and smoke. 
[00:26:30]  School was dedicated, my school anyway, where I was, to just finding weed.  Yeah.  In the morning, you'd go in, find your guy, and he'd be like, you got some joints?  Yeah.  And he'd hand you this Marlboro box, and you'd flip it open, and it's full of doobies.  And you'd pick, like, yeah, look at this pin.  It's too thick.  Ooh, that's a fatty.  Let me grab that.  How much?  The darn price for weed for a billion years.  It's a buck. 
[00:27:00]  I got a buck.  It's a dime, dime, nickel, quarter.  Well, this is my lunch money, but screw it, I ate yesterday.  And then you smoke the tube, and you're like, oh, I wish I had that buck.  I'm hungry.  I could really use one of those big, soft pretzels and a Coke right now.  One of those giant cookies.  Yeah.  In the cafeteria.  Save the road.  You smoke it down until your fingernails are orange.  Right?  Well, yeah, and then we get burnt.  Dude.  Pass it.  Pass it over here. 
[00:27:30]  And then you just have to drop it in the palm of his hand.  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I got it.  I got beat up once for throwing a roach away.  You always got beat up.  Because I thought it was done.  Like, we could have gotten a few more ants off that.  Where'd you throw it?  I don't know.  I don't know here somewhere.  Oh, man.  And they'd be on their hands and knees trying to find the rope.  You dope.  You could smoke that down to nothing.  Same guys that used to smoke it through a wiffle ball bat just because, you know, they  thought it was cool.  I didn't realize early enough in my life that it was just not, I was totally unmotivated 
[00:28:00]  when I smoked weed.  And it totally ruined my high school career because I would smoke in the morning and go  to my friend's house and watch cartoons.  Lay on the floor and watch cartoons.  And period after period would go by and I just wasn't there.  And then after a while, I was like, you missed social studies 30 days straight.  I'm going, yeah, I didn't want to go.  I hadn't been there in a while.  I was going to get in trouble. 
[00:28:30]  Why bother after missing five days?  Oh, let me guess.  You're up to a Greek history.  It's history.  I can make it up.  It's happened already.  I know how it ends.  I could read about it later on.  Yeah.  It's not going to change.  I probably won't need it.  Yeah.  All right.  Very good.  But, yeah, getting back to that.  No, we don't smoke pot.  No.  I'm drug free, unfortunately.  Life would be a lot funner if I wasn't.  But it's up to your allergy medicine. 
[00:29:00]  I'm going to have an allergy today.  I have to be.  The Rock of New York, 1027 WNEW, Van Halen, coming to town Saturday with Kenny Wayne Shepard  to Jones Beach and Sunday at the PNC Arts Center.  It's Opie.  It's Anthony.  We've got a guy on the line that has a comment about the $600 garbage cans that the mayor is  putting all over the city.  I think he could spend the money on other things that are much more important.  For a garbage can.  Ten times more than what he usually spends on garbage cans for the city. 
[00:29:30]  That's retarded.  And these cans, these garbage cans, they weigh 220 pounds when they're empty, right?  Yeah.  So no one's going to, you know, walk away with them.  Yeah.  Tommy, what do you got?  Yeah, Opie.  They're looking at these new garbage cans.  Yeah.  What do you look at?  They're going to have the whole sanitation department go on compensation.  He's looking to save money.  220 pounds.  These guys are going to pick these things up.  Yeah, how are they going to empty them?  They won't even pick up a garbage can outside somebody's house if they'll weigh 15 pounds. 
[00:30:00]  He's out of it.  And talk about a weapon for the kids in the street.  Forget about it.  You hit your car with one of those things, you're talking like major insurance problems here.  That's true.  Mayor Hitler, I mean, Giuliani, is out of his mind.  He's out of his, maybe he ought to run for president.  We'll see, because nobody will sleep with him.  Okay, guys, take care.  All right.  Bye-bye.  He makes a good point, right?  He got rid of the wrong cans, the mayor.  He got rid of the nice, soft cans in the sex shop he liked to look at. 
[00:30:30]  Yeah.  And replaces them with $600 big metal cans.  My mom's on the line.  Well, you want to talk to my mom?  Yeah, what do you want?  Mom.  Hi.  Hi, what's up?  Why didn't you tell the guy the whole story about Opie?  What was the other part?  Did you look like Ron Howard when he was low on the series?  Ah, but who wants to know that?  Because now he's losing his hair.  When you say Ron Howard now, everyone thinks balding, middle-aged director. 
[00:31:00]  Yeah, but I don't think about the young Ron Howard anymore.  No.  Did you really use the smoke pot through beer cans?  I'm sorry to say, yeah, that's the truth.  It's nice to listen to the radio and find out what my son's been doing.  Yeah, I'm getting fired again.  Are you?  No.  Hey, hey, Mom.  What?  So Grandma doesn't like the Big Willie Pop bit. 
[00:31:30]  Did you hear what she said to me the other day?  Yeah, she didn't like the part about Chelsea.  Tell you the truth, I don't like that part.  Take it out.  My 88-year-old grandma is begging me not to play that ever again.  Oh, my God.  She didn't do anything wrong.  It's not about her.  Oh, no.  Did you see me leave the house real fast, Mom?  Yeah.  Her and I sat here and stared at each other for four days.  You and Grandma?  Yeah.  Stare at each other for four days? 
[00:32:00]  Yeah.  No, that's great.  All right.  Bye.  Bye.  Yeah.  There you go, my mom.  Oh, my God.  Learning such things that you used to smoke pot out of a cocaine.  Well, we discussed this last week.  You know, I'm glad we're back home in New York, but, you know, all our families are listening  to us day in and day out, and it gets embarrassing at times.  I know.  You know, when we worked out of town, then it didn't matter who was listening.  We could selectively give them tapes of, you know, what we thought was appropriate 
[00:32:30]  for them to hear.  Yeah.  Now they're hearing about sexploits and pot and all kinds of stuff.  And everything else we did growing up.  Yeah.  Great.  We got to play the bit my grandma hates.  Oh, poor grandma.  Grandma, if you listen to the radio, turn it down.  Turn it off.  Turn it off.  All right?  Or and chillin'.  But she, Chelsea, didn't do anything.  Why are you picking on Chelsea?  She's just the daughter. 
[00:33:00]  Him and he.  Aunt Sheila, if you're listening, just turn it to Rocky's show on that other station.  T-Rocke.  Grandma won't know the difference.  You know, that show's so boring, she won't know the difference.  T-Rocke, you're going to explode.  All right, I think grandma's not listening anymore, so check this out.  1-0-2-7-W-N-E-W, where Ruck lives with Foreigner, the cars in there, and Semisonic.  Those guys played Jones Beach this weekend, closing time.  It's Sophie and Anthony. 
[00:33:30]  What's up?  Do we have time to be childish?  Don't we always?  Well, no.  We're pretty mature most of the time, but every once in a while we like to do, like, childish bits and stuff.  All right, what do you have?  What do you have?  Well, actually, I've got to call a library.  A library?  Yeah.  Okay, and what would you be calling a library for?  Oh, I'm just, I'm calling the library.  I've got to look for some books.  Books?  Yeah.  Okay.  Why would we be doing this? 
[00:34:00]  Oh, thank you.  On the radio?  Well, you know, because no one else has really done it in New York, right?  Okay, a library.  Trying to be original here and do our own stuff,  so no one has called the library before and just ordered books.  That's all it is.  It sounds captivating and fascinating.  Yeah, that's all.  I'm dialing up.  It's actually ringing now, so.  Okay.  All right?  Yeah, it's an innocent bet.  1027 WNEW, the Rock of New York R.E.M.,  coming up with something new in time for the fall. 
[00:34:30]  Can't wait to hear what those boys are up to.  Sophie and Anthony, Giants play the Jacksonville Jaguars,  7.05, Friday night, right here on NAW.  If you're tooling around town, you can check out the game.  Did you catch any of that preseason stuff there on Sunday?  They looked pretty good.  It's way too early to tell, though.  Yeah, it is.  It's too early for football.  It's still hot out.  All the main players get in there for, I don't know, three plays,  and then they're out.  Yes.  You know.  Fully but surely, I'm getting into the football season. 
[00:35:00]  It's just so early.  Yeah, it is.  It's over baseball.  We've got to wait for the Yankees to win the World Series,  and then we could go full, you know, we could go into the football season.  Yeah, that's going to be interesting.  What do you think?  Who do you think the Yankees and?  Yankees, who are they going to play in the World Series?  Who cares?  Too early.  Who cares?  Mets.  Oh, stop.  That would be.  This town would go nuts. 
[00:35:30]  Yeah, I know.  The Mets half game out for the wild card.  Doesn't happen.  Yankees 55 games over 500.  Woo!  That is insane.  That's crazy.  They're playing the Twins tonight at the stadium.  They had their little blood drive today.  We were talking about this earlier.  The Yankees are coming up with some bizarre promotional events.  They had Beanie Baby Night a couple, I don't know, a couple days ago.  Yeah.  And now.  Pistol Night.  I like Pistol Night.  You like the?  Yeah, Handgun Night.  Handgun Night's pretty cool. 
[00:36:00]  It's fun.  I used to like going to bat day.  What a mess that turned out to be.  And ball day, where everyone just throws the balls back out to the field.  Hey, man, this ball is cheap.  Yeah, this isn't a real major league ball.  No, but today they had the blood drive, which is obviously a very good thing.  This time of year, the city is in desperate need for blood.  Yeah.  So, you know, do your part if you can and give blood.  Right?  But it was just a weird concept, though.  They had people stop by the stadium all day long, and if you gave blood today, you got 
[00:36:30]  a ticket for tonight's game.  That's what you need is to lose a pint of blood before you have to venture into the Bronx to  go to the Yankee game.  You got to be sharp when you go to Yankee Stadium.  Right.  You can't be lumbering and weak.  No.  Like I was saying, it'd be like that sick zebra in the Serengeti.  The Lions sense it.  They know.  Well, you know it.  You're laying on the road where your innards ripped out.  That's true. 
[00:37:00]  They could sense that you're weak.  Yes.  So.  The Lions.  You need all your energy just to get from the car to the stadium.  That's true.  You know?  Imagine doing it without a pint of blood in you.  A pint short.  Huh?  You get a woozy.  You get a woozy.  A little woozy.  I never gave blood.  Really?  No.  I did.  It's not fun.  I'm a wuss.  I go for the little, you know, cookies and thing of orange juice.  I don't like needles and stuff.  No?  Blood.  Take out of me.  Blood.  And I get all woozy.  And like, ooh, I turn white. 
[00:37:30]  Ooh.  I get that same feeling that when you get, like, you're hitting the kneecap.  And you get that nauseous, oh, I'm going to puke.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I don't feel that.  That's how I feel when I have blood taken or anything.  Oh, that's too bad.  Yeah.  People need blood this time of year.  I know.  And I feel very bad about that.  Yeah, sure you do.  But, uh, all right.  Hey, uh, we got the most requested song of the day.  What was it?  Sean Mullins.  Oh, I thought you weren't going to tell me.  The guy from Georgia.  He sings a song called Lullaby. 
[00:38:00]  That's on the way.  And we'll do Tom Petty next.  1027 WNEW, The Rock of New York.  Sean Mullins, Lullaby.  Atop the CD, Soul's Core.  We were the first radio station in New York to bring you that one.  As it slowly fades out, it's Opie and Anthony.  And time once again for a look at traffic with the Reverend Al Sharpton.  So, if you're on the roadways, listen up.  I have been vindicated. 
[00:38:30]  No justice, I grant.  No justice, no peace.  No justice, no peace.  All right, there he goes.  I have been vindicated.  I have been vindicated, everyone.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Wow.  Wow, there he goes.  Very nice.  All right.  He's angry.  Great.  We're out of here.  Hey, Matt.  That's it.  Yeah, our little show is over for a Monday.  It went pretty fast.  Hands it over to the capable handsome of Matt.  After the weekend, dammit.  Did you see Al in the hallway as you came into the studio? 
[00:39:00]  He ran by me so fast, I kind of like spun around.  He can't run fast either.  And then I got it.  Got that big belly.  He got it on the side of the head with that medallion.  He keeps it under his suit now.  All right.  What do you mean weekend?  What?  Weekend?  Yeah, it's all over.  Oh.  Yeah.  You know?  I just got to wait for another one.  Back from the...  Should be around in a couple of days.  Hopefully.  Another four days.  Another four days, we'll be at another weekend.  Great.  The way it works.  Okay.  Great conversation. 
[00:39:30]  All right.  Thanks.  This is great.  People in their cars really want to hear this.  Same way.  Yeah, good.  That's good radio.  Well, then hit a damn button.  No.  What are you waiting for?  Because it's more painful this way to spread it out a little while.  All right.  All right, Matt.  What's going on on your show today?  What's going on?  Hey, Ben!  I don't know.  You really don't know?  I don't know if we have any tickets.  I know I got great tunes.  And I'm prepping for Harvey Danger, who's on Letterman tomorrow night.  Yes, he is.  So I'm going to get some Harvey on.  That's for damn sure.  Those guys playing Irving Plaza tomorrow? 
[00:40:00]  Yeah.  Currently Buffalo.  What are you doing over there?  I'm just playing the kazoo.  I don't care.  You two talk to me.  We can put Earl on the air and mess with him a little while.  No, he's running on the studio.  Okay.  If anything, if we learn anything today, be nice to Earl this week.  It's because Earl is getting ready for his annual butt whooping from the Brooklyn Union  Gas Boys in softball Wednesday night.  Really?  This is the one team that just, without a doubt, beats us senseless.  Every year? 
[00:40:30]  Yeah.  Like Tiny on the team is the only guy that's like 6'4".  Everybody's bigger.  Well, the Epileptics beat you guys senseless, too, a couple weeks back.  Isn't that cute when they call big, fat people Tiny?  Isn't that just adorable?  Geez, I never would have thought of that.  All right.  Let's get out of here.  Thank you. </pre>
