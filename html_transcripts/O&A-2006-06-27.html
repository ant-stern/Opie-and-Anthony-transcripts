<pre>SHOW SUMMARY:

The Opie and Anthony Show opened with the hosts, Opie, Anthony, and James Norton, engaging in self-deprecating and offensive humor, referring to themselves and their crew with insulting nicknames like "rabid radio retards" and "perverts."  They discussed the cancellation of a competing Pittsburgh radio show, "The Alan Cox Radio Show," highlighting the importance of catchy names and boasting about their own high ratings in the city.  Listener calls followed, with one caller admitting to drug use and another praising the show's improved behavior since joining CBS.  A Long Island listener shared a story about No Filter Paul's excessive drinking and poor tipping habits.

A substantial portion of the show reviewed Jim Norton's "Lucky Louie" based on Newsday's "Review Crew" critiques.  The hosts focused heavily on a scathing review by Kevin Timpone, mocking his appearance and writing style, contrasting it with more positive reviews.  A pre-recorded bit with "Tippy Tom," a self-described gay, homeless, alcoholic, HIV-positive man with head lice, featured incoherent commentary on the immigration wall. The hosts then complained about their breakfast (a bruised banana and unappetizing oatmeal), speculating on how the "Review Crew" would rate it, transitioning into a discussion about stereotypical New York City cab drivers in movies. A heated exchange with a critical caller from South Carolina followed, centering on the hosts' perceived superiority to Howard Stern and their radio success. The show concluded with promotions for their upcoming comedy tour, listing fellow comedians and appearances, and a discussion about attending Derek Jeter's charity event, with Opie expressing reluctance due to his Mets fandom.


The next segment involved Opieâ€™s plans to attend an event with his friend Roland for photography, with Anthony expressing doubts about Roland's intentions.  They discussed an event invitation forbidding photography, followed by a screened listener joke.  A bagel and orange juice delivery arrived, supposedly from the "Cleveland Seals" (possibly a miscommunication).  A caller criticized the show's supporting cast compared to Howard Stern's.  This led to a discussion of a Maury Povich segment about a woman with a pickle phobia, featuring extended clips and humorous commentary.  Marge called to promote an animal shelter fundraiser, resulting in a darkly humorous conversation about death and old age, interrupted by prank callers.  The segment concluded with an interview with The Dudesons, a Finnish stunt group, who described their upcoming TV show and movie, detailing various stunts, including one involving a thumb and a testicle mousetrap.


The Dudesons' appearance continued, focusing on their stunts, including using a member as a human dartboard and using a giant rubber band on another member's stomach, assisted by "Club Soda Kenny." They recounted a bear attack resulting in a lost thumb and described their upcoming uncensored movie featuring their 600-pound pet pig, Brittany.  Microphone issues were prevalent.  The hosts described the Dudesons' humor as "hack jokes."  Following the Dudesons, Def Leppard (Joe Elliott and Phil Collen) were interviewed. The conversation included their music videos, career longevity, replacing band members, maintaining band camaraderie, touring anecdotes (including Robert Plant pushing a laundry hamper of band members onto a stage), and rumors of backstage debauchery.


The Def Leppard interview continued, covering their musical evolution under Mutt Lange, lyric meaning (or lack thereof), continued appeal to younger audiences, on-stage mishaps (including a drummer throwing sticks into the crowd and a near-stage collapse), their Sheffield music scene experiences, the impact of grunge, and pyrotechnic experiences.  Several callers asked questions about Def Leppard's career and shared personal anecdotes.  Author Tucker Max then joined the show, discussing his book, "I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell," recounting explicit anecdotes about alcohol, drugs, and sexual encounters involving bodily functions and sexual acts.  Callers reacted with amusement, disbelief, and skepticism.  The segment ended with further discussion of Max's work and website, with frequent profanity from hosts and guests and a brief inclusion of an angry phone call to British Telecom.


FULL TRANSCRIPT:


[00:00:00]  It's the O.P. and Anthony show on XM202 featuring O.P., Anthony, and James Norton.  Push the button!  Can you hear me?  No!  Shut up!  Me and Anthony!  We're so excited to be back.  Rabid radio retards.  Wow!  We're dummies!  We're the only radio show that makes you want to hate us.  We've been known to get our faces in the news.  We're perverts.  Stupid.  We stink.  We just love doing radio.  This is a weird show.  No one puts asses in the seat like Greg and Tony. 
[00:00:30]  O.P.  I love the hitting and the fighting.  Anthony.  I'm a terrorist looking for other terrorists.  Jesus.  I'm a speechless, worthless nothing.  We all know that.  I love women.  I'm a slump, fat pig.  And a crew of misfits.  Hurricane Ben!  Ben looks like a tall baby.  He's here like Chuck.  No!  Martini Steve!  Steve is a piece of garbage.  Perfectly enunciating boobs that we paint him out to be.  Right.  E-Rock!  Oh, please, go into a car wash with his mouth open.  I bring nothing to the table.  I don't care. 
[00:01:00]  Shut up.  No.  What's wrong, Aaron?  My closet's burning so bad.  Sit down and put on your laughing hats.  Just relax.  Here comes the funny.  Welcome to the Opian House.  Shut up!  Let's get him out.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  Is that your little brother? 
[00:01:30]  It's a good-looking kid.  This is great iced tea.  Act like wherever you are, that's the place to be.  Good morning and welcome to the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Our phone number 1-866-313-FREE. 
[00:02:00]  That's 1-866-313-FREE.  Free man.  Let's go right to Pittsburgh and say hi to Brandon.  Brandon, what's going on today?  Hi, Brandon.  Brandon!  Hey, how you doing?  All right, what's up?  Good, sir.  I want to call in and tell you that the other rock show that competes with K-Rock  already canceled their morning show.  What happened?  Wait, what?  The other rock show that competes with K-Rock here in Pittsburgh  already canceled their morning show beginning of last week. 
[00:02:30]  Oh, they did?  Wait, there's another rock station in town that has a morning show.  What was the morning show?  Alan Cox.  Who?  Alan Cox radio show.  Alan Cox?  Yeah.  Alan Cox.  And they canceled him.  He wasn't doing too well.  I guess not.  I guess not.  Did he have a catchy name for the show?  What's that?  Did he have a catchy name for the show?  No, he just called it the Alan Cox radio show.  Ah, see, that's the problem right there.  You got a name like Alan Cox. 
[00:03:00]  You want to use that.  That's right.  You know?  All right.  All right.  I'll let you guys know there.  All right.  Hey.  Thank you, Brandon.  Well, it does say doing good in Pittsburgh, question mark.  That's why I went to you, Brandon.  We got ratings for Pittsburgh yesterday, and we're doing fine in Pittsburgh.  Yes, coincidentally enough.  So we want to thank Pittsburgh for checking out this program.  I didn't hear about that.  Jimmy, yes.  We're doing very, very well in Pittsburgh.  We, I don't know, we went up like 300%.  A person's 18 to 34. 
[00:03:30]  Yeah.  Something like that.  That was one of the cities I went to in our off time.  I did a club out there, and I'm like, I know if we're ever on here, we'll do well.  It's like a buffalo.  They're just, you know, like maniacs.  They just want to drink and watch football.  Well, that was one of the first returns from a station that we hadn't previously been on.  So very important to us that they came in, and it was very positive.  Yeah, so far so good.  Yeah, we're rolling.  We need to learn the Pittsburgh radio market, though, because we're getting bored with Mantown,  let's be honest. 
[00:04:00]  The Mantown thing is way too easy.  We need to pick on some other people out there.  Too easy.  Done with them.  And Bert from Philly, Alan Cox got a first-class ticket to Mantown.  Bye-bye.  I don't know the man.  I don't know what he does.  He's got a silly name.  I don't care that there's an X in it.  Tell him you don't want to sit on him anymore.  He'll understand, believe me.  I bet you he didn't even take advantage of his name.  Of course not.  If his real name is Alan Cox, then you're not getting that wacky production together. 
[00:04:30]  Of course, you'd have to.  Or actually, it could be really bad.  I love Cox in the morning.  Why wouldn't you?  Just kidding.  Am I hearing that right?  All right, Brandon.  I just hear him say that.  How do you guys got it?  An X.  I get it.  All right, thank you.  Let's say hi to Chris in Texas.  Chris, what's going on?  Hey, what's going on, boys?  Hey.  How are you doing, Chris?  Oh, very well, man.  Just hanging out here.  Actually still awake.  That's the only reason I'm actually getting the call. 
[00:05:00]  I'm usually asleep.  Yeah, what are you, crazy?  Yeah, yeah.  Throw the paper, man.  So you got to work, right?  You're a paper boy?  Yeah, I got like three jobs, man.  But that's just one of the ones.  Wow.  We have two jobs.  Why do you have to hold down three jobs, sir?  You know, I got to do a lot of drugs, man.  Is it the dope?  The dope cost any of the money, sir?  I'm sorry?  Can you say that one more time?  I was wondering if the dope was costing you that much money. 
[00:05:30]  Oh, yeah.  Yeah, of course, man.  It gets to be expensive.  You know?  At least he's working for it, though.  Yeah.  We rarely start the show by going to the phones.  And I thought it might be a good idea today.  And I'm starting to second guess myself.  Hey, don't be fishing.  I know.  Hey, my bad.  My bad.  What do you want to say, Chris?  I wanted to say I'm an XM listener.  I've been listening for a while.  But I'm really enjoying listening to you guys on CBS trying to clean up the whole act.  And I think it's working out really well. 
[00:06:00]  And I'm proud of you guys.  And Lucky Louie rocks Jimmy.  And I'm afraid of the virus here in Texas because we can't get you guys on the radio station like everybody else.  But I appreciate it.  Oh, shut up already.  How am I going to sit after this slathering?  I like it.  This should have been a five-second phone call.  I'm sliding off my chair due to saliva.  Punching out, boy.  Thank you, Chris.  Juan in Missouri.  We're going to just try this for a couple more. 
[00:06:30]  Well, you need some help swimming?  Juan.  Yeah.  What's up?  What's up, man?  Man, I love your show.  Thank you.  I usually just listen to it for a few minutes because I go to work.  But when I get out of work, I do the replay.  And you're all funny, dude.  Thank you.  Well, thank you, Juan.  Did you find yourself listening more on the replay?  Yeah, because I have to work.  No, because I was just going to.  But Jim. 
[00:07:00]  Yeah, but.  He's funny, too, man.  All right.  All right, well.  What do y'all come up with this shit?  Ah, Juan.  You know, how early was that one?  And now the goal of getting a dump sheet with nothing on it ruined.  That's your goal.  That's not my goal.  I say curse, curse, and more cursing.  Cursing is good.  Bill in Philly, what's up?  Hey, guys.  I wanted to call and give you a little info about the Pittsburgh market.  I lived there for about 15, 20 years. 
[00:07:30]  Thanks, Bill.  Go.  The WDVE is probably going to be your main competition out there.  Yeah, I've heard of DVE over the years.  It's Jim Crenn, and the new guy is Randy Bauman is his name.  And he's not new.  I guess he's been on the show for about eight years.  And it's just basically the DVE morning show.  And it's a staple in Pittsburgh, like the Steelers and pierogies.  All right, we understand all that, but what kind of bits are they doing?  They do a lot of stuff. 
[00:08:00]  How can we pick them apart and make their lives miserable?  How do we drive them crazy?  What's their version of man-town?  Yeah, let's go.  What do they got?  The thing is, they really don't have it.  I'll be completely honest with you.  They got a really decent show.  They do a lot of making fun of themselves.  Uh-oh, now we have no way to fight it.  That's it.  We'll have to concede.  Thanks, Bill.  Thanks for giving DVE a huge commercial today for us.  Yeah, thanks.  I'm sure the bosses over here appreciate that.  Thanks for all the help, Bill.  You dummy.  Good for nothing, Bill. 
[00:08:30]  What's he doing here?  They're so great.  What a dope.  Good point, Ant.  We want people to call and say the show stinks and tell us why so we can pick it apart.  So we get some ammo.  Oh, get under their skin a little bit and drive them nuts with this ONA virus.  Jackass.  All right.  Well, that wasn't too much fun, huh?  Like I said, fishing, you know.  You go to the phones right away.  You cast your line.  You're hoping to come back with something big.  Sometimes the bait's just gone.  It's all just chewed. 
[00:09:00]  Oh, chewed.  A little piece left.  You had a nibble.  I think I had a nibble.  All right.  Let's say hi to Justin on Long Island.  We can always count on Long Island for a good phone call.  Justin, what's up?  Hey, boys.  First, I'd like to start by saying I will be celebrating my anniversary at 400 New York  Avenue in the heart of Huntington Village at FH Riley's this evening.  That would be my brother's restaurant.  Thank you, sir.  Thank you.  Absolutely.  By the way, we went off on a whole thing yesterday because my brother set up No Filter  Paul with a buffet for his birthday and Big A's birthday. 
[00:09:30]  And a lot of people came down.  Everyone had a lot of fun.  And then No Filter Paul decided to start buying Jaeger Meister shots for everybody at the end  of the night.  And it's a fact, too, that he was buying drinks for everybody all night long after my brother  said, you know, you could drink for free.  Yeah.  And he didn't mind if he bought a beer or a shot for someone every once in a while.  But he's just lining up 15 shots for people.  He doesn't realize that this is a business in the end.  We love hanging out there.  We love seeing the listeners and all that.  But we also got to pay bills or my brother's got to pay bills. 
[00:10:00]  Yeah.  And then at the end of the night, No Filter Paul tipped $20.  Skin Flint.  $20.  And the bartenders and my brother are like, you've got to be kidding me.  $20.  And now No Filter Paul is trying to throw Big A under the bus saying that Big A didn't  tip at all either.  Well, Big A should have tipped.  I mean, look, let's be honest.  He drives a cab.  He knows the value.  I asked that yesterday because he knows the value of it because he picks guys up and drops  them off.  Well, when you're in that situation, you know what you do?  I mean, my brother took care of everybody.  What you do is you get everyone together at the end of the night and you collect money 
[00:10:30]  for one big tip for the bartenders.  Hey, there you go.  And if you're in that situation and you realize Big A doesn't make much money in his life,  then you help him out a little bit.  That's what we do, right?  Right.  Anyway, yeah, it's FH Riley's 400 New York Avenue in Huntington Village.  But what do you got, Justin?  Nothing, bro.  I got the paper this morning and I got the review in the review crew of  Lucky Louie's Big Jimmy.  Yeah, we said...  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I just wanted to tell Jim there's one little fax on that page that he is going to love 
[00:11:00]  ripping apart.  Probably got molested as a child.  I already saw the...  I know who you mean.  I was actually really happy with this review crew...  Review...  You.  Yeah, Newsday does this and we make fun of the review crew from time to time.  Just the name, the review crew.  They're just regular people.  They're your regular...  Could be your friend or neighbor.  Out on Long Island.  On a local Long Island newspaper, Newsday. 
[00:11:30]  Well, they all got something in common.  They're like in their mid-twenties.  That's it.  My chick's doing it next time.  But this stupid idiot called up the freaking newspaper and said, I love ONA and Ron and  Fizz.  Can I review Lucky Louie?  I was like, honey, you can't review it now because you just told me you love the freaking  show.  But it seems like they use the same people.  There's a lot of regulars in the review crew.  They take a hot topic or a hot film or a hot club and they send these dopes there to either 
[00:12:00]  see the movie or see the TV show or go to the club and then they review it.  They review it and give it a grade like you got in school.  A through F.  Mr. Hand.  F.  F.  F.  Later, boys.  Later, man.  So here's the deal.  Louie Louie.  F.  He got a show now.  Comedian Louie C.K.  stars in the raunchy new HBO comedy, Lucky Louie.  Sundays at 1030.  We asked the review crew to weigh in. 
[00:12:30]  And of course, this is the show that our own Jim Norton is on and doing a great job with.  I was very happy with this overall review, except for the curmudgeon number one.  F.  Kevin Timpone?  Also known as Private Pyle from Full Metal Jacket.  Look at this fat-faced idiot.  He should be killing himself on a toilet.  He is fat-faced dope.  Well, the first line, you don't want a guy like this actually liking your TV show, Lucky Louie. 
[00:13:00]  His name is Kevin Timpone.  He's 22.  He's from Bell Harbor.  His job?  Restlessly studying for the LSAT.  Hey, who isn't?  But also being awesome.  Relentlessly studying for the LSAT.  I thought it was restlessly.  What a wonder I dropped out of high school.  Restlessly.  Relentlessly studying for the LSAT.  Can't sleep.  I'm trying to study.  Being awesome.  He's awesome.  Is it, say, being awesome?  Yeah, his job is being awesome.  Yes.  You don't want a guy like this liking your show.  Holy idiot. 
[00:13:30]  And he's wearing like a little, like a brown cap that's kind of tilted to the side.  Of course it is.  He looks like a fat douche.  He's one of these guys that are out there all over the place.  They're trying too hard to look cool or be cool.  Yeah.  Or be awesome.  Well, Jimmy Norton back in the 80s.  His fantasy job.  Trying too hard to be cool and fit in.  He just wants to be hip.  Wearing your hip-hop clothing.  Oh, his stupid little hat turns off.  Let me take a look at that.  Look at that face.  Should that not have a rifle in it? 
[00:14:00]  Wow, that really is a private pilehead.  Why does everybody hate me?  I don't know.  You keep giving bad reviews, Leonard.  Getting everyone in trouble.  You fat-faced dope.  My joker.  His favorite night spots.  Southpaw and 7-Eleven.  Hey.  Hey, that's my bit.  What bit?  Don't do my bit.  I think that's your bit.  I only have a few bits.  Don't do them.  But I...  Don't do my...  I can't come up with too many more.  But Opie, I...  So don't do my bits, please.  But I was... 
[00:14:30]  Because you are a disgusting fat-body private pile.  And then Kevin says...  You want to read that, Jimmy?  Well, his fantasy job is I want to own my own record store, Record Label.  Which means I like music.  Not quite good enough to be involved with it.  Yeah.  So I'll sell CDs.  Kevin says...  The only good thing about this show is the theme song.  It seems like an excuse to talk graphically about sex in front of an audience.  Now lean forward and joke yourself.  Right. 
[00:15:00]  Sorry, buddy.  It doesn't work.  A good sitcom should immerse a person in the show.  Not remind them that there are people being forced to laugh 25 feet away.  What is that private pile?  Sorry, Jelly Donuts, sir.  Change the channel after Entourage, which is the best show on TV.  Boy, this guy really goes black and white.  I love this show.  It's great.  Lucky Louie's on.  It sucks!  F.  Get a hold of yourself, would you, fatso?  F.  The worst grade you could give anything. 
[00:15:30]  You can't get a worse grade than that is.  So now if they review a show that is nothing but a test pattern for a half hour,  he cannot give it a lower grade than he has given your program.  He would give that the same grade he has given our program.  Like I never understood giving either a 10.  Right.  Like when they give these TV show contest things that are based on the 1 to 10 rating,  a 10, especially when it's the first person out of the gate, 
[00:16:00]  and some dopey celebrity judge gives it a 10,  then you're pretty much stuck with that being the best thing.  And now the next person that comes out could be brilliant.  You can't give them a better grade.  Same thing with an F or a 0 or a 1.  The guy, he limited himself right there.  Should have given you a D minus.  A D minus, perhaps.  D minus.  I think that, and here's what bugs me about this guy,  it's the fact that he has a fat head and it's tilted to the right. 
[00:16:30]  Of course it is.  I don't mind a fat head and I don't mind a head that's tilted to the right,  but when you have both, you should strip down to your skivvies and kill yourself all the D.I. yells at you.  Did he even know what side it was tilted to?  What side was that, private pile?  Sir, left side, sir!  Are you sure, private pile?  Sir, yes, sir!  What side was that, private pile?  Sir, right side, sir!  All right, now he's learning.  That's exactly the type of hat he has.  I want to slap that hat off with a bedpan.  Pick up your lid. 
[00:17:00]  Pick up your cover.  Pick up your cover.  Pick up your cover.  The rest of the review crew, though, you got an A, an A, a B+, and then...  Well, we got a D, the next one down.  Lindsey Greenstein Tameo.  Tameo.  Oy vey.  As a, and here's what she says,  As a fan of Louis C.K.'s stand-up and sketch comedy,  I was awaiting a vehicle to showcase his talents.  This sounds like it's a ringer.  Doesn't it? 
[00:17:30]  This is not it.  Oh, boy, she drops the other shoe quickly.  This bare-bones scenery makes the Honeymooners look overdone,  gives a staged feel to the show that claims it's inspiration from Louis' real life.  Thank you for actually not getting it, but getting it.  That was kind of the intent.  Yeah, that was the intent, and good.  Compare it in some way, shape, or form to probably the funniest show that was ever on television.  Well, just, you know, a woman sees the scenery.  I kind of like that, though.  Yeah.  She doesn't like a messy house. 
[00:18:00]  I don't like the fact that she doesn't have a modern kitchen.  Yeah.  That's what it was.  How is she supposed to avoid being hit?  It says, there are great raunchy one-liners by comedians like foul-mouthed Jim Norton.  I like that, foul-mouthed Jim Norton.  Absolutely.  I'm going to start calling you that, even if it's on social occasions.  You get a pretty good review from her, that means.  And the fabulous Laura Keitlinger, but it's too bad they don't add up to anything watchable for 30 minutes.  Great. 
[00:18:30]  D.  D.  I think she should have given us a C. That's just my take.  Yeah.  And you'll notice that I only think people should have given us better grades.  I'll never go that A should have been a B.  But then again, I'm biased.  Give me those ribs, LOL.  And we got a good review from the black girl, Shaila Mentor.  It's been a while since we've had a comedy like this.  Lucky Louie is a refreshing addition to HBO's lineup, but touches a different aspect of married life in a raw, no-holds-bar way.  The characters are funny and politically incorrect. 
[00:19:00]  It's nothing like you'll see on network TV.  It's married with children, just as dysfunctional, but three times funnier.  And A.  Bravo.  A.  A fine review.  And then it goes on and on.  Hang that on your fridge.  It goes on and on with a B-plus and an A.  B-plus and an A.  So overall, you did very well with the review crew.  I think so.  Do I have an average?  Two A's, a B-plus.  That average is out to about a B.  And the D and the F watch each other out, so we'll throw them away.  All right.  They always throw away the lowest grade and the highest grade, so just the lowest. 
[00:19:30]  Get rid of the F, get rid of one of the A's, and so you've got an A, B-plus, D.  Ooh, that's a C.  Oh, I don't know.  Maybe it's a B-minus.  Who knows?  Yeah.  Yeah, you're in the B category with that.  You're into the B's.  Yes.  Very good, Jimmy.  Congrats.  Thank you, except for that fat boy.  The review crew.  Wants to be a lawyer, do you?  Newsday loves the review crew, though.  They love a lawyer, so you need another fat lawyer.  All right, we've got to take a break. 
[00:20:00]  We're just warming up with the O.P. and Anthony show.  The O.N.A. virus spreading across America.  I think we can do a little more homeless radio going into break.  It's quick and easy.  From time to time, we've got Tippy Tom.  He comes by and does an actual radio show for us over on XM.  We give him like an hour just to sit there and take phone calls and do the hot topics of the day.  He's disgusting.  He stinks of his own waste.  He's drunk, has HIV.  What else about him?  He's gay.  He's gay. 
[00:20:30]  Yeah, and he just gets drunk to the point where he's completely incoherent.  So makes for a good reason.  Gay, homeless, alcoholic, AIDS-infested guy.  Yeah, and I think he's got head lice.  This is him talking about the immigration wall.  Ooh.  Brian from Dallas.  Dallas, text.  Brian, you got a question for Tippy Tom and Blue?  Go ahead.  From Dallas?  Guys, I wanted to ask you what you think about this section of the immigration bill that says we have to ask Mexico if we can build a wall along the border. 
[00:21:00]  We've got to get their permission.  Uh, I think that's wrong.  Uh, I personally, uh, there's no wall.  I'm tired of the wall.  We throw down the wall in Germany, uh, break up Germany.  And, no, we don't need no more walls.  That's all I have to say.  Let it go.  That was informative. 
[00:21:30]  And finally...  We built the wall in Germany?  Is that what he...  I don't know.  Finally, Tippy Tom says goodbye.  And, you know, uh, as far as this homeless radio show goes, we'll have him back to do a whole new batch, but this is the last clip we have to play over here, okay?  Tippy Tom signs off.  Homeless radio.  I just want to say I love you and be well.  Love all your guys.  So what was that, Tom?  Sorry, Blue was talking.  I just say I love you and be well.  Be well. 
[00:22:00]  And I'll hold you if you need me.  And just...  I got to go now.  Just...  Wait, wait.  Not yet, Blue.  Just...  Just...  Just be you.  And be the best you you can be.  And be strong.  And don't take no...  from nobody.  And, uh, blah.  That's what I say.  Not blah, but...  I love you, okay?  How's that? 
[00:22:30]  And there he goes, Tippy Tom.  He's great.  All right.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Looks like Jimmy's very annoyed at his oatmeal.  We'll get into that next.  And some other things.  Never right.  Rush Limbaugh and his Viagra.  It's a great story today.  Some kid that hasn't missed a day of school since 94.  Who cares?  Slow news day, is it?  Uh, that's what I'm starting to think.  We'll get into all this next.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hi.  There's nothing I like better on a sunny day  than going fishing and listening to ONA. 
[00:23:00]  Sometimes when I go out,  Uncle Henry makes me wear fishnets.  And a corset.  Tell me, Anthony!  These pointy shoes hurt my feet. 
[00:23:30]  Yeah, this is the Opie and Anthony show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  Trying to swallow here some egg whites.  On a bagel.  On a bagel.  Jimmy's trying to, um, eat his cement.  That he gets every morning.  A nice big tub of concrete.  And a banana peel.  Full of just gushy, mushy, ugh.  And then Sam comes in and gets me two great bananas.  So what happens is guys will just grab these stupid bananas. 
[00:24:00]  And by guys, you mean one guy.  Well, whoever else goes to.  The poor new guy that can't seem to figure out the food.  It's always the new guy.  Yeah.  It's always the new guy.  You got to kind of feel up the banana a little bit.  Make sure there's no soft spots.  But don't feel it up until you're making it mushy.  Right.  You got to just apply just enough pressure.  Enough pressure to the banana.  You feel the soft spot and you realize that's a bruise underneath and you move on to the  next banana.  Actually, you should just grab it at the base of the banana and rub your hand up and down 
[00:24:30]  it a few times to make sure it's firm the entire length and you're not hitting any bruises.  So you had a really bruised banana.  Yeah.  Why would they care?  He just grabs it and walks out with it.  Who cares?  It really annoys me.  Who cares?  Jimmy, you do a lot.  I know.  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  Can you tell your baby, could you get me a banana that doesn't have AIDS?  Is that possible?  And then the oatmeal.  I love oatmeal.  I wouldn't eat that.  Yeah.  It's a little rough. 
[00:25:00]  Of course it is.  What would Jimmy's review crew give your breakfast this morning?  An F minus.  No, Fatso would probably, he'd probably get an F because there's not enough sugar.  When you obviously need that much comfort food, you can't eat anything without sugar.  I imagine the two black people would give it a B or a C.  Right.  They seem to like everything.  And that one girl, I don't know what she'd give it.  Again, because she likes a nice modern set, so she'd probably get an F as well.  Yeah.  See, my husband wouldn't go, oh. 
[00:25:30]  The oatmeal doesn't look very tasty, though.  It's awful.  Oh, jeez.  Just throw it up against the wall.  No.  Make it stick.  But again, there's only so many places open at this hour that have it.  Yeah.  Stupid Brooklyn Diner opens at eight.  I think no.  They hold...  They really open at eight?  Yeah.  They hold Midtown hostage, that place, because they're really the only good place to go for  food that isn't run by, you know, savages that are sending money back to Al-Qaeda when 
[00:26:00]  you buy a bagel.  How ironic.  How do you know that's going on?  What?  How do you know that's going on?  You ever see some of these people in these delis?  I'm not happy with a bunch of these people out there working in Manhattan.  Trust no one.  Trust no one.  How do you know they're actually sending funds to Al-Qaeda?  I don't know.  You know, they're probably just helping out their own families, working hard.  Is there another diner here? 
[00:26:30]  No, we're looking.  We're trying to find other places.  We just need people to, you know, cook breakfast for us every morning.  People also don't want to walk too far.  It's like seeing out of the Warriors at that hour.  You know, you've got to really watch your step out there.  Sorry about getting stabbed for that oatmeal, Warriors.  Just half a black face and two pretty juicy lips.  It is creepy out there, man.  Fast forward a couple hours and it's all business people out there.  But when we show up, homeless people, gangs going home for whatever they were doing. 
[00:27:00]  Baseball uniforms and bats chasing people around with bananas and oatmeal.  It's definitely creepy out there.  I shot Cyrus.  Dude, how did you find the Warriors music in three times?  It was them.  There's a story in the paper today.  I mean, he rocks good, but he's not that good.  I was going to get really creeped out.  Did you really have it just there?  All right.  I give you credit then.  There is a little story in the paper today that the guy that played Cyrus in the movie.  Yeah, the gang leader. 
[00:27:30]  Yeah.  Can you dig it?  That guy that was holding the big meeting with the gangs.  He gets shot.  He really doesn't have that many lines or anything.  He's an integral part of the story, but he's not in the movie that much.  He's suing the video game company, the company that put out, I think it's Rockstar, right?  Suing Rockstar.  Another lawsuit for Rockstar.  Fantastic.  Jesus.  This will be an easy one, though.  Yeah.  Suing Rockstar for $250,000 for using the image of his character. 
[00:28:00]  Now, how much ownership could he possibly have of that character, first of all?  Secondly, has he done anything with the image of that character since the movie?  And it's not like an image of somebody that can be hurt in a video game.  The guy is obviously looking for a payday here, because I guess things haven't gone so well.  He's probably down on his luck.  Down on his luck.  He needs to pay some bills. 
[00:28:30]  Mr. 1952 speak.  He's down on his luck.  Should you give him a dime for a sandwich, because he said he hadn't had a bite all day?  Did you bite him?  Did you?  Ah, people use down on their luck still, don't they?  Oh, of course they do.  When you flip him a dime, that's great.  Pardon me.  It is a slow news day, because that guy's looking for a few bucks who cares.  Um, what, what, what?  That's funny, they're talking about John Mayer in the paper. 
[00:29:00]  Not everyone was laughing when songwriter John Mayer tried some stand-up at the Comedy Cellar,  according to one witness.  The high-spirited Grammy winner called the woman he's bedded sluts and took liberties with the N-word.  I love John Mayer.  Wow.  He certainly did, and he's funny.  He, uh, his defenders insist his schtick wasn't sexist or racist,  and that he was just recalling a bit he once did on The Chappelle Show.  Hey, you guys, we got a, here you go.  We got one of these guys on the line.  Oh, no.  Uh, Bob in South Carolina, what's up?  Bob. 
[00:29:30]  Hi, Bob.  Bob.  Hello.  What's up, Bob?  Don't listen to the radio, listen to your phone, we're on the air.  What's going on?  Let's go, Bob.  Is this, are we on dual radio and XM?  Yes, we're on XM and regular commercial radio.  Yes, Bob.  We're dual, as you call it.  Hey, um, man, you guys suck, man.  So then why?  Why are you listening?  Yeah, why are you listening to the show, then?  Wouldn't you just not?  Like I was telling you a minute ago, you know, I'm trying to give you guys a shot at it.  You weren't. 
[00:30:00]  I don't get it.  You weren't telling us to.  You weren't telling us, you idiot.  You were talking to a phone screener.  As far as a phone call goes, you suck.  But you don't get it?  What don't you get, Bob?  Yeah, I just, uh, I used to listen to Howard Stern a lot.  Right.  Why haven't you gone over to, uh, Siri yet?  Why are you not serious?  You know that Howard's a hack that couldn't adapt, right?  And that's why I had to go away and then just do, uh, satellite radio.  But anyway, go ahead.  You know, why didn't you pay?  Well, we bought a car that had an XM radio in it.  So, uh, you know, we stuck with XM radio. 
[00:30:30]  Jesus, is that the way you handle your life, sir?  That's just the way it is?  I can't do anything about it?  Why don't you just, uh, have them switch it to a series if that's what you want?  There you go.  Hey, man, you're a real douchebag, man.  Really?  Why are we a douchebag for pointing out the obvious?  Yeah, dude.  You're lazy.  Is that how you met your wife?  What, did you just knock her up in the backseat and go, all right, well, this is my life forever?  Ah, might as well.  You settling idiot.  Oh, he gave you the Opie laugh.  All right, well, so you're not a very loyal fan. 
[00:31:00]  You're just kind of a scumbag who goes wherever the water takes them.  So why are you handing us for it?  Yeah, dude, if you don't like the show, then go find something else.  Stop dead.  There's a million choices out there.  Sir, you're a Howard fan.  I just love these guys.  That just doesn't like anything else.  Well, I love these guys.  Giving you a chance, but you guys suck.  Don't give us a chance, Bob.  We don't give a crap.  Turn it off.  Go listen to something else.  We don't need to convert you.  Drink a bottle, hit a wall, and then get us serious.  We don't care. 
[00:31:30]  Hey, as soon as, you know, whatever, if Howard was on.  Oh, Howard.  Hey, dude, Howard is now irrelevant.  He's on satellite with a few hundred thousand listeners, and one of them not being you.  We're on regular radio.  We're taking over his stations.  We're here now, Bob.  Things have changed, Bob.  You like Howard so much?  Listen to him.  But you know something?  You probably just can't swing it.  What's the matter?  Wifey won't let you get a serious unit? 
[00:32:00]  The wife don't like Howie?  Hey, listen.  There's no ifs.  There's no ifs, dude.  There's no ifs.  He's over there.  We're over here.  There's no ifs.  I like his hypothetical situation, though.  If what, Bob?  If what, Bob?  You guys would be out of business.  If what?  If Howard was on XM, you guys would be out of business.  Maybe so, Bob, but you know what?  If he had good fans like you who would switch to serious, XM would be out of business.  Bob, how does that make sense?  If he was over here, we'd be out of business.  Yeah.  Do you know how many more listeners we have than he has? 
[00:32:30]  What are you talking about?  Do you know how many more people we're speaking to on a daily basis than he is, Bob?  Well, yeah, it's pretty funny how I call one time this number, and I get right through.  Yeah.  Oh, really?  Yep.  So, lucky you, Bob, and lucky us.  Bob, you're trying to say we have no listeners, but for the last week, we've been getting unbelievable  ratings from all over the country.  Yeah.  So, guess what?  That point sucked.  But the Bob phone call rating service is saying that we stink on ice.  Dude, just admit it. 
[00:33:00]  You didn't have the guts to just switch to serious.  You got the XM, and you just took it, and you're resentful.  You made it yourself because you didn't switch over.  You should have been a man about it and just switched over, and not just been a faggot and  went with what they gave you.  And you'd be enjoying the person that you like listening to.  Yeah.  Don't be mad at us because you're a faggot who didn't do what he should have done.  Seriously.  Bravo.  All right, well, listen, you guys have a good day.  Yeah, you do the same, stupid.  Hey, Bob, we got to you, didn't we?  He knows we're right.  Yeah, we got to you.  There you go.  Beat it, stupid. 
[00:33:30]  And go try calling your hero with any criticism.  See if he leaves you on the line.  See if he even takes your call.  All right.  Getting into other things, the reviews for Superman are coming in like crazy now.  The New York paper's giving it three and a half stars and four stars.  Well, there's finally one that can walk.  Look, on the steps.  And I went last night.  Yes, we know it's the Superman music. 
[00:34:00]  Otis, he loved playing music over everything.  Hawk?  Yeah.  Oh, he really is a girl.  Oh, God, what a woman.  He just wants to feel important because his whole family's listening in West Palm Beach.  Doing Superman talk and cue the music.  Well, he had it.  This is why I like Eric.  He had it ready because he knew we'd be talking about it.  That's right.  He's a good boy.  At least someone around here is working.  Attaboy, Hawk.  Superman.  Just don't play it again or I'll break your fingers.  Superman was good, but you know it was a great movie?  Close Encounters.  Yeah.  Uh-huh.  Uh-huh.  That's right.  Scramble. 
[00:34:30]  Now look at you just panicking.  You know it was a good movie?  Bingo Lodge of the Traveling All-Stars.  Anyway.  Yeah.  I like Spider-Man 2 and Hulk.  Yeah.  Hulk actually sucked.  You saw Superman.  How was it?  Go ahead.  Play the stupid music.  It makes you feel better.  How was it?  Of course it was going to be great.  Was it?  Is it great?  Of course it was going to be great.  They spent what?  $225 million on it?  I want to see it. 
[00:35:00]  They're bringing the franchise back.  What do you think?  They were going to have a bad movie come out?  Yeah.  Yeah.  The original was getting a little dated.  What's he do in the first scene?  He probably knocks out a horse.  That would be a director with a sense of humor, man.  They did have Marlon Brando.  Some of his original scenes recut or whatever.  But he's dead.  But he's dead.  That's what made it a little creepy and weird.  Yeah.  When the new Superman was talking to, you know, well, not talking because it was Marlon Brando 
[00:35:30]  leaving him a message.  Blah, blah, blah.  What?  I'm Jell-O.  Yeah.  My son.  And what did he give him the advice?  Yeah.  And where is it supposed to take place?  Between a couple of other episodes?  Between, uh...  Come on, Kev.  Come on, Kev.  Come on, Kev.  Of course, Kev knows.  Kev, for the love of God, Roy.  Uber geek.  Greatest movie ever.  Uber geek.  Big Kev, everybody.  Big Kev.  Did you like this? 
[00:36:00]  What's that?  You like Superman?  Yeah.  Yeah, it was great.  It was a little long, I thought, but...  It was very long.  Almost 240.  That's what they do with those movies, though.  With our stupid hours, I'm like, well, I could go to a seven o'clock.  A seven o'clock showing of Superman.  I'll be home in time for Betty Bye.  Oops.  Ten o'clock, we're leaving the theater.  Is it what?  Ten o'clock, after the...  After iMac dude has to talk about the 3D glasses for a while, and then we get previews,  and...  Ooh.  And then, uh, finally the movie starts, and then it's, what, about two and a half hours  long. 
[00:36:30]  It was in 3D?  It was in 3D.  You had to, like, all of a sudden they cue you to throw on those goofy 3D goggles.  Oh, I can't be bothered.  Or 3D glasses.  I cannot be bothered with the likes of that.  This is in 3D?  Huh?  Well, about, what, 20 minutes?  20 pieces of it.  Yeah, pieces.  Oh, stop with the gimmick.  All of a sudden, like, the glasses flash on the screen, so, oh, time to pick up your  3D glasses.  Time to be distracted.  Time to be distracted.  And then those scenes are a little weird.  It takes you out of the movie, because now you think you're on some kind of Disney ride 
[00:37:00]  for a few minutes, and then back to the movie.  That annoys me.  Why would they do that?  Just make them, you don't need that.  You don't need a gimmick.  Just make the man fly.  Just make the man fly.  The man movie, that's it.  Are they going to have the 3D glasses for every showing, or just certain?  No, just for IMAX.  Oh, just for IMAX.  Yeah, you go to a regular movie.  Is it IMAX or IMAX?  Are they playing there for a while, Ken?  I want to go there and see it.  Is it playing there for a while?  It'll be there for a while, yeah.  Yeah, a long, long time.  But you have to share the glasses, or do you buy them?  No, you share them.  Are you kidding me?  You leave them in a big bin with all the other head lice, and conjunctivitis, and every 
[00:37:30]  other kind of disease that could be possible.  Would I use them?  No, I have my own.  You were just saying yesterday, you're not a germaphobe.  I'm not a germaphobe, but that's a disease-o-phobe.  It's just stupid 3D glasses.  Well, you take some child's glasses that has pink eye, and throw it on, and tell me how  your itchy eye feels for the next month.  Yeah, because that's what's happening.  Yeah.  People are getting pink eye all across America. 
[00:38:00]  Didn't say across America.  Because they just went to see Superman.  You pick out that unlucky lottery of 3D glasses.  I look forward to the first case.  Yeah.  Probably.  You want the rich Voss glasses, where you put the finger on the back of your ear, and  get garbage dumpster juice smell ear thing.  I don't care.  How about that?  I don't care.  Just throw the glasses on, enjoy the movie, go home.  Sticky kiddie fingers all over the lenses.  I don't care.  Perhaps a big eyelashes guy, who is just fluttering against the glass. 
[00:38:30]  Yeah, you've got to clean them off a little bit with your shirt, you know.  No, you can get them in the bathroom and wash them.  Idiot chewing on the...  With some of them chewed up, the ends chewed up because somebody puts them in their mouth  while they're waiting for the glasses to flash on the screen.  Disgusting chew-the-glasses earpiece guy.  I feel sorry for the people that see Superman about two months from now, because then these  glasses are going to be in bad shape.  Just a mess.  Mine were all kind of greasy.  I had to clean them off a little bit.  I'd rather be wearing Moe Green's glasses while I was getting a massage. 
[00:39:00]  But, I mean, the 3D stuff was cool, but kind of, I don't know, kind of cheesy in a way,  I thought.  Yeah, that is kind of gimmicky and cheesy.  For such a movie, that doesn't really need one, if you ask me.  And then you're reaching out, trying to grab objects that are floating in front of your  face.  That's always fun to see the whole audience, like, reaching out, trying to grab a cell phone  that's floating.  I know.  I've seen it at Disney.  When you go to Disney, they have Honey, I Shrunk the Audience, which is a 3D.  They have the Muppet 3D show. 
[00:39:30]  They have the 3D Terminator thing at Universal Studios.  And they're all, you know, state-of-the-art 3D.  And I've used the glasses there, because I assume that they're safe for some reason.  I don't know why.  They're safe.  But don't tell me that they are not.  They're safe.  You're getting ridiculous.  To answer your question earlier, it takes place, the new Superman takes place.  After Superman 2, they're igniting 3 and 4.  After 2.  So, 2 is Zod.  Kneel before Zod. 
[00:40:00]  They've eliminated Richard Pryor and the awful 4D.  Good, good.  Very good.  So, he comes back, though.  He's been gone?  Where did he go after 2?  Five years he's been in space looking for remnants of the planet Krypton.  Yeah.  But doesn't that allow it in that Kryptonite?  Yes.  What is he looking for remnants for?  That's like looking for stuff that hurts you.  So, no one else can hurt him, I presume.  But what's he going to do?  Like, does he have a lead box?  Burn it out.  Like, before it gets to him, to where it can affect him, he can see it and kind of zap it? 
[00:40:30]  Right.  Push it in the other direction.  Push it in the other direction.  He can get it out of here because he sees, like, this stuff is going to be bad news.  And Kevin Spacey as Lex Luger gets to, you know...  Luger?  Luthor.  Luthor, sorry, sorry.  Lex Luger, the wrestler.  Yeah, yeah.  He gets to go free because Superman wasn't there to go to court.  To testify because you must face your accuser?  That was a little hokey to me.  Well, that's very Superman comic book-ish. 
[00:41:00]  Right.  That something like that would happen.  Well, he would go through all this trouble and then decide to leave before the court day  was a little silly to me.  Yeah.  I mean, come on.  Well, he doesn't know the judicial system that well, I guess.  Couldn't his trip wait a little bit?  But no.  He leaves, so I guess he gets to go free because he wasn't in court the day that they needed  him to testify.  Something tells me he didn't learn his lesson.  Right.  All right.  Is Ned Beatty in this one?  He made the first one for me.  Yes, Mr. Luthor.  The movie was terrific, and it was going to... 
[00:41:30]  Of course it was going to be terrific.  The one observation I was telling Anthony in the office before the show, they got to  get rid of the stereotypical New York cab driver in these movies.  Yes.  Oh, yeah.  Ugh.  You know...  It's not realistic.  Because obviously this film is taking place in New York City.  It's Metropolis, sir.  It's New York City.  It looked exactly like New York City.  Yeah.  Everything is the same.  And the police cars are all Metropolis, PD, but it's NYPD cars.  And then, of course, they have to have a scene in the cab driver seeing some crazy stuff. 
[00:42:00]  And he has to poke his head out of the side of the car with his cigar, his unshaven face,  his hack cap, his hack cap, and with his Brooklyn accent.  Because that's how all the cab drivers are out there in New York City.  Need a lift, lady?  Exactly.  What the...  Hey, what's this guy flying around?  Hey, I'm on the one-day show.  Oh, yeah.  The stereotypical...  Holy Toledo.  Exactly.  No cab he talks like that. 
[00:42:30]  Completely stereotypical.  What they're going to have is a sweaty Haitian who you keep thinking is talking to you,  but then you realize he's on a Bluetooth.  Yeah.  That's what they should have is a taxi cab driver.  Yeah, because these guys, they refuse to stop talking on their cell phone.  You get in the cab and you're like, yeah, I'm going to Broadway.  And 42nd, excuse me?  And they don't even acknowledge you that you just said excuse me.  They just keep...  And they're talking to some person in their native tongue on their Bluetooth. 
[00:43:00]  About what?  About what?  About who cares?  And totally ignoring you in the back.  Maybe I wanted to take a different route.  Maybe I see you're pulling some kind of scam on me.  So I've been driving for 16 hours.  The inside of my underwear smells like the Staten Island dump.  How about you?  What else could you be talking about?  My life sucks.  Yours?  So it was a terrific film. 
[00:43:30]  And it's going to be just huge for everybody involved.  A few instant feedbacks coming in.  Opie, want to know how Ric Flair comes into the whole thing.  And Arn Anderson, right?  Chris Luger, his henchman.  That's great.  After work yesterday, I had a female cabbie.  Oh, you did?  And all hell was breaking loose around us as she was driving me home that I was convinced  that she stole the cab.  Really?  That bad?  Dude, people hated this.  I don't know if it was her first day on the job or what. 
[00:44:00]  But everyone was just beeping and cursing her, giving her the finger.  Was she going too slow?  She just was confused in general.  Weaving in and out of traffic.  She wasn't being aggressive enough for New York City traffic and getting in everyone's  way and stepping on the brake and all that.  Yeah, cabbie's got to get you there quick or kill you trying.  Let's say hi to Liza from Jersey.  Liza.  Hey, guys.  Hey.  I just wanted to give you some constructive criticism.  I used to listen to your show all the time when you were on NEW, and then my husband got 
[00:44:30]  your XM thing, and he's obsessed with your show.  And I started listening again since you came back on Free FM.  Now he gave me his Wi-Fi, so I listen to your XM show as well.  Wow.  This is confusing.  Yeah.  So, first of all, too much gay stuff yesterday.  Way too much gay stuff.  But we were doing a rundown on the gay pride weekend parade, which is big, and then there  was some gay award show that I had watched, and we decided to talk about that. 
[00:45:00]  Yeah.  Too much gay?  Our own Steve is gay.  How do we not talk about that?  You guys know too much about gays.  It's just uncomfortable.  When you live in New York, you know, there's a lot of gays here.  And second of all, Anthony.  Uh-oh.  What did I do?  Enough already with your rich, big mansion and your subs.  I never bring it up.  We tell him that all the time, but he gets mad.  I know.  He rubs it in our faces.  Enough already.  I never bring it up.  It's brought up by other people.  I try to be modest.  All right.  You guys suck. 
[00:45:30]  I'm a modest man.  You're not a modest.  We'll be looking out the window, and we'll see a plane, and an aunt will go,  Ah, I bet you that's landing in my living room.  Yeah, by the way.  And I talk about my house because I have guests.  Because of the visitors.  Because I have visitors that have children, and they run around my house like maniacs.  And it makes for interesting radio because finally we've decided to maybe treat ourselves  to some good living.  I should have asked her if she had a house and for how long.  Because you know something?  I've never owned a house in my life.  I hope right now that boy is vomiting into your couch cushions. 
[00:46:00]  Hey, Kim in Boston on the Instant Feedback.  She writes, Opie, stop the bull, and then star, star, star, star.  Just spell out the word.  It's Instant Feedback.  You can curse on it.  Kim from Boston.  Opie, stop the bull-ass.  Howard is a hack and couldn't adapt.  Come on, Opie.  I know you guys hate him and are in competition, but saying stupid crap like that makes you  sound like a moron.  But miss, it rhymes.  Do you realize there was an issue with him adapting to the FCC rules? 
[00:46:30]  It's completely accurate, and it's something the ONA pest came up with, and we love it,  and we say it as much as we can.  And it is.  And we know every time we say it, someone out there is getting pissed off, but that  is the reality.  He said it himself.  Where's the clip where he said he was doing subpar radio for 10 years because of the FCC,  and he couldn't adapt, and they were wrecking his show.  He couldn't get anything done because of the rules of the FCC.  No, it was that he was either wasn't willing to adapt, or he was just plain lazy and didn't 
[00:47:00]  feel like working as hard anymore.  Then a huge paycheck came through.  So what's inaccurate about that, Kim?  I can't find it right now, but...  She's gone.  And in that same 10-year period, Anthony and I made our names for ourselves, so I think  it's pretty accurate.  I think it's pretty damn accurate.  Indeed.  You got it.  All right.  Found it.  Good work, E-Rock.  What else is new? 
[00:47:30]  That kid just does things.  He's been doing subpar radio for the last 10 years.  Oh.  Oh, shoot.  Well, this has stopped the show completely.  Thanks, Kim.  I've been doing subpar radio for the last 10 years.  There you go.  There you go.  Out of his own mouth.  Because of the FCC.  Because it couldn't adapt to the rules.  So we call that a hack.  That's how it goes.  It's a hack that couldn't adapt.  So keep getting pissed off, Kim. 
[00:48:00]  That just annoys me because it doesn't really rhyme.  I think it kind of does.  Everything doesn't need to rhyme.  Yeah.  All right.  We're a little late.  Why don't we take a break?  It's the only virus spreading across America.  And now, Reflections on James Norton with Mr. Robert Stack.  I'd sure like to be his girl.  Walking in the park hand in hand.  Wrapping my legs around.  Cuddling in the spoon position.  All right.  Little Jimmy Norton.  Bring on. 
[00:48:30]  No.  Bring him.  Bring him.  On the Opie and Anthony Show.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  Yeah, you're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show?  Just want to remind people about the Opie and Anthony traveling virus.  The comedy event of 2006 coming soon to a venue near you.  We've got three dates so far.  I think we're going to add more if these go well, right?  We're talking August 5th, Worcester Center in Boston.  August 26th, PNC Bank Art Center in Jersey. 
[00:49:00]  September 9th, the Tweeter Center in Camden, New Jersey.  That's across the river in Philly there.  Wait, when is that in Jersey?  July, right?  Uh, what?  July, Jersey?  No, no.  August 26th.  Oh, Jesus.  Tickets on sale.  It says today.  Well, they have been on sale for a while.  We should update this copy.  They're all Ticketmaster locations.  Presented by Bud Light.  Always worth it.  Basically, it's the comedians you know and love from this program.  Bob Kelly and Rich Voss and Patrice O'Neill, Jim Norton, Bill Burr. 
[00:49:30]  Bob Saget is going to be calling the show on the next day or two to talk about the comedy show.  Also, Carl Smith.  See ya.  It goes on and on.  You can get the lineups by going to our website that we can't promote or Ticketmaster.com, okay?  Aren't we supposed to have a meeting about all that today?  Secret meeting?  Yeah, we got a lot of meetings.  Post-show meeting.  I've got to get my hair cut.  Our lives are being ruined by meetings. 
[00:50:00]  I have to get my hair cut for our big event on Thursday that we'll be attending.  Ooh.  I don't think Opie's going.  I can't wait to go.  Yeah, I think I'm going to blow that one off.  I got a busy travel day on Friday.  Yeah?  And we're going to be out late on Thursday night.  That's rough.  I don't know if I can do it.  It's Derek Jeter's charity event.  And I'm a Mets fan, so have fun with the Yankees.  Turn to charity.  Have fun.  I'm going.  Me too.  And so is my date, Roland, whoever he is. 
[00:50:30]  I love Roland.  Why can't you bring a girl?  Because, like that caller said, we're all gay.  Is that it?  I don't have a girlfriend.  I want to bring my friend.  Yeah.  My buddy went to the entourage party, hung out.  He gave his card out to everybody.  He's not your buddy.  He's my buddy.  No, he's not.  He likes me.  No.  You want Roland there to make sure you get good shots.  That's what a friend has.  That's the only reason.  He doesn't trust me.  You don't trust me for pictures. 
[00:51:00]  Absolutely do.  No, you don't.  I completely do.  You would trust him taking a picture of you with a celebrity, Anthony?  No.  Because you shouldn't, because I'm too shy.  You would say, I want to picture him, and I'd go, no, I'm not helping.  You'd help me.  No, he wouldn't.  I guess he would.  He would fake help you like he's trying, but when it comes down to it, he's not going  to get in there and get aggressive and get the shot done.  And why don't you tell Roland the only reason he's going is so he can take the celebrity  photo.  That's the only reason he's going.  You like him as a person? 
[00:51:30]  Yeah.  He's a bore.  No, he's a good guy.  With a high voice.  And he also hands out his card to everybody, Roland.  He gives out his card to try to get guests on this program.  Roland's an animal.  And I'm going to ask, because I went to the movies with Roland, Lindsay and I and Roland,  because he got the tickets, and they screwed up the whole thing.  So I show up at the theater, and he gives me his tickets and sits in the lobby and waits  an extra 20 minutes to try to get another pair of tickets.  I went upstairs and saved him a seat, and now I'm trashing him on the show. 
[00:52:00]  He is a really good guy.  Yes.  But to say that he's not going just to take the picture for you is crazy.  But I don't even know if we'll be able to get any, but I do like Roland.  Actually, that's kind of what I want to do.  I want to get to this weapon.  Boy, I wish things just loaded faster.  What happened?  Because I'm trying to get to a website, and they never explode fast.  I don't want to say it.  Why?  Oh, by the way, where is Camber Boy?  Because you say it, and then here it is. 
[00:52:30]  Click here.  Invitation.  I'm looking for the invitation to the event that we're going to, because I want to read  something.  I already know it.  To Jimmy Norton.  I want to read something to Jimmy Norton.  I don't want you to read it.  That has never stopped him before, by the way.  No.  That has never stopped him before.  And you've seen some of the success he's had?  He smuggles cameras in, and he gets the job done.  There's always an outside area.  You don't have to wait. 
[00:53:00]  You may catch somebody.  I'm not going to get pictures of everybody there, but maybe on the way out, you see somebody  outside.  Hey, why not?  Oh, is that it?  At the entourage party, I didn't do anybody at the premiere.  I didn't ask one person at the premiere.  And they just hang out outside the place, waiting for people to snap pictures?  That's where I got Kevin Dillon.  That got frozen screened.  Just, just.  Uh-huh.  Well, just tell them.  It says right on the invite note, no picture.  I liked it in its reading, in the way it was written, because it was written in such a way  that pretty much said, you know, really, no pictures. 
[00:53:30]  No cameras.  They don't want anything.  They pretty much said, we're not kidding.  No pictures.  No, that takes you to pal talk.  Don't play.  Why?  Hey, dude.  E-Rock's been doing a great job today.  Let's say hi to Jeff in Chicago.  Jeff.  Good morning, boys.  Hey, Jeff.  Hey, I just wanted to say congratulations to E-Rock on all the well-deserved praise he's  been getting today.  I think it's great that you guys are finally starting to recognize what he brings to the 
[00:54:00]  show.  Who is this?  This is Jeff in Chicago.  Thanks for calling, Mr. Nagel.  It says E-Rock is getting too much praise today, so where's the joke, Jeff?  Well, I just...  Help us out, please.  We need a joke by now.  I bring nothing to the table.  I was wondering if E-Rock was going to say thank you to me.  For what?  Come on, guys.  Trust me on this.  Wait, what? 
[00:54:30]  Trust you on what?  Oh, man.  Now, take a...  The screener didn't put my joke through.  What?  The screener didn't put my joke through.  The screener's supposed to insert your joke?  What are you guys...  What are you guys like?  Is he a straight man?  I was going to do what I was going to do on the phone here.  What was your joke?  I was going to do Jimmy's little bit and tell him to shut up, and who cares?  Oh, that would have been a good one.  How did that get messed up?  I don't know.  Ah, dude, the laughs that would have ensued.  Oh, give us your home address.  We're sending Kenny to kill you. 
[00:55:00]  That would have been so funny.  Thanks, Jeff.  All right, later, Ken.  And Kenny's shaved face is bothering me on some weird level.  Kenny shaved his mustache.  It's the first time he shaved his mustache in 20 years.  19 years, something like that.  Oh, wait, what?  I had an industrial accident.  But anyway, I wanted to bring to your attention...  Did we know that Cleveland was sending us any kind of food today? 
[00:55:30]  No.  All right, because we just had a delivery, and the note here is from the Cleveland Seals team  to OBI or Anthony.  OBI?  OBI.  OBI.  OBI.  And it's the Cleveland Seals team, not sales team, Seals team.  Seals team.  What did they send us?  A dozen bagels and some juice.  Juice or juice?  I didn't hear that.  Bagels and orange juice. 
[00:56:00]  That's just like the...  I thought they were trying to ship a few out of Cleveland.  That's just like the steak and eggs we were eating yesterday morning.  Thanks, Cleveland Seals.  We got food from the Palms yesterday, some of the finest breakfast food I've had in years.  Oh, wonderful.  And these guys sent us hard bagels and orange juice.  Bagels, cream cheese, and...  Ooh.  And thanks.  Seals team.  I don't thank you.  Did a special person write this?  I...  Was there a special person working there that wrote this?  They probably have a green card in their pocket. 
[00:56:30]  Maybe.  I'm sure what happened here is they probably called the place to order it.  Didn't go down there personally and said, I want that sent with this note from Cleveland  sales team and some, some, some savage is trying to write it down and didn't get it.  Where are the bagels?  Well, now you know why Gino Steaks wants everybody to speak English.  There you go.  So you...  Can I see the bagels?  Oh, yes. 
[00:57:00]  Those are cool.  They've got to be good.  Oh, no.  I wouldn't mind having a bagel.  But we...  Two points.  And boom, go the bagels.  Slam dunk.  But they...  But the guys wanted some...  We don't know where they came from.  Who are the Cleveland Seals?  The Cleveland Seals team.  Is that the sales team?  It might be, but it says Seals.  Did they send us a...  How bad did it do? 
[00:57:30]  It says Seals and they don't even know my name.  I'm not eating their bagels.  It's OB.  That's the stupid idiot at Pick a Bagel.  What do you expect?  Yeah, it is.  It is the stupid idiot at Pick a Bagel that...  OB!  Seals team.  From the sales team.  Seals team.  Yeah.  Sales team.  Seals team.  Yeah.  Okay, I write that.  From the hoodoo two.  OB.  OB.  Or, Anthony.  Or.  Let's say hi to Alex in New York.  Alex, what's up? 
[00:58:00]  I think what these guys are saying, they couldn't back it up.  But even with Howard's comment about being subpar, Howard's show subpar has a better supporting  cast.  I don't think it's you guys.  I don't think he's being a comedian.  I think his supporting cast, maybe the people behind him.  What are you talking about?  I don't think it's you guys.  We do a fine radio show every day.  Yeah.  It's a known fact.  You know, it's not like he's a comedic genius.  I think he surrounds himself with a supporting cast that might be a little better.  Really?  So, the supporting cast is better. 
[00:58:30]  Yeah.  Oh, we need a better supporting cast.  Alex, thank you.  OB.  Everyone's fired.  Leaf, please.  After 12 years.  You've got to come up.  Yeah.  I guess we'll have to get a better supporting cast.  Better supporting cast.  Oh, what a dope.  Enough with the stupid phone calls today, people.  You know, if he was calling from maybe 1990, you know, the great Jackie Martling when he  was in there, the great Billy West, people like that.  Now, that's a supporting cast to have. 
[00:59:00]  But please, just stop.  All right, listen.  Let's get into some stuff here.  Girls scared of pickles on Maury Povich.  Now, there's a subject.  Hey, it is a slow news day, I'm telling you right now.  Gee, I wonder what episode might have brought that up.  So, you're scared someone's going to slap a pickle on your cheek.  As you sleep?  Yeah.  What, uh, is Maury ripping off Tyra by doing fear things?  Probably.  Like, you know, Tyra would get people with their phobias.  Tyra herself has a phobia, a little-known phobia of dolphins. 
[00:59:30]  A little Tyra trivia for you there.  But, uh, she, uh, she was doing that.  Right, right.  And now Maury, all of a sudden, gets the bug up his, uh, what is going on?  Are, uh, no.  They're trying to salvage the bagels because people are hungry.  Are you taking the bagels out of the garbage so Jimmy Norton can eat?  I don't want a bagel.  Garbage picker, garbage picker.  I don't want a bagel.  I don't want a bagel.  No, but I'm telling you, they might want a bagel.  They're trying to salvage the bagels because it turns out everyone's hungry. 
[01:00:00]  They're fine.  They actually sat at the top of the can.  You can eat out of that.  That's fine, dude.  Believe me, I don't, I'm, um, I'm kind of nuts about this stuff.  Those are fine.  You guys dig in.  Yeah, they're fine, all right.  Dig in, all right.  Everyone's looking around like, but we were hungry.  I shan't be digging.  Mm-hmm.  Anyway, uh, yeah, Tyra's scared of dolphins.  We've done all that.  And she likes the phobia shows.  And, uh, she makes people confront their fears.  Yeah.  In very, um, healthy mental ways. 
[01:00:30]  She just, like, if someone's afraid of spiders, she'll throw them in a vat of spiders.  Because she feels, you know, that's the best way to get over a phobia, I guess.  No one threw her into a, uh, big pool full of dolphins, did they?  But now this, uh, woman's scared of pickles.  Yeah, a lot of people say Maury did it before Tyra, so Tyra was ripping off Maury.  Oh, who?  Uh, Marge, Long Island, what's up?  Good morning, gentlemen.  Good morning.  Please don't make fun of me.  Why wouldn't you be the name like Marge when you start out like that? 
[01:01:00]  Okay.  How old are you, Marge?  I'm afraid to tell you.  Oh, don't be scared.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  Let me just say one thing.  Oh, uh-oh.  My belief is that 70 is the new 50.  Hey, you know, God bless.  70 years young, Madge.  70 years young, Marge.  But I don't want a birthday party.  What I want you guys to do is to help Little Shelter Animal Adoption Center.  We need money desperately.  Little, little shelter. 
[01:01:30]  And...  Wait, what kind of pet do you have?  I have a little poodle.  Does he keep you company, does he?  Yeah, it's better than a man at least says he's by my side all the time,  and I don't have to worry that he's straying.  Ah, straying.  A stray dog, that's funny.  Oh, you're a pit, Marge.  Now, wait a minute.  Now, wait a minute.  Guys, please listen.  All right, we're listening.  You know there's going to come a day that you're going to be dead in that bed,  and your poodle's going to be nibbling on your arm, right, before they find you.  I'm very attractive.  So get off the 70-bit. 
[01:02:00]  He's going to grab your wig and run around the house because he always hated it.  Opie, 70's the new 50.  And I told you not to make fun of me.  That's Opie.  I asked him not to as well.  Going to be chewing at that leather skin, waiting for your son to show off from Phoenix to claim the body.  Can I say something, guys?  Hold on, Marge.  We're laughing at your impending death.  Thank you so much.  Will you at least put something in the paper?  Hold on, Marge.  Wait, wait, wait. 
[01:02:30]  Hold on, Marge.  The dog's not going to have a choice, right?  No.  It's going to eat the food that was left out.  It will get hungry.  It will start eating your wig glue.  I should not have said anything about making fun of me.  That was the wrong move.  Maybe licking in between the dentures hoping for something.  Probably off to a bad start with the asking not to make fun of you.  Yes, yes.  But you're right, though.  50 is the new 70.  Godspeed.  70 is the new 50.  Oh, well, that way.  As a matter of fact, I'm thinking of doing a TV show called Now and Then. 
[01:03:00]  Right.  And I'm going to have, well, if maybe you want to help me sell it, but what I'm trying  to do is to have people that have had very illustrious careers and are now past 60 years  old, you know, do something like be in the news and go back and show people that you  don't have to be 30.  All right.  Is this the pitch meeting?  How about a great show called Cadaver Calls a Radio Program? 
[01:03:30]  Thank you so much, gentlemen.  Now, can I talk about Little Shelter?  Go ahead.  What kind of pets are we trying to save?  We have 360 cats in the cattery.  All right.  There's a cattery.  Wait, what the hell is a cattery?  Cattery?  I have a cattery and don't make any remarks about that.  What is a cattery?  I do not make a remark about a cattery.  Okay.  Yeah.  360 that need homes.  Sounds like the things you have on your eyes.  Over 100.  I'm going to remove my catteries.  But that's not what I'm talking about.  But I want to talk about the cattery. 
[01:04:00]  All right.  What names did you go through before you decided cattery was something that wasn't, like,  horrible sounding?  Pussy farm fall flat.  Was it something that, like, you went through that, but everything sounded a little too much like  cat jail?  Well, it sounded like...  And cattery sounds fun.  I don't want to say on the air.  Marge, Marge, your chances of a stroke are large.  Oh, my gosh.  Why am I kidding?  Bird from Philly.  I don't even get paid for it.  No, you're a volunteer at the little shelter. 
[01:04:30]  Atta girl, Marge.  Atta girl.  I know where that is.  It's on Warner Road.  Oh, God bless you.  Steven from Bayshore.  Yeah, my old neighborhood.  Steven from Bayshore.  Can you ask her to have her family call back with her autopsy results?  Would you like to adopt little shelter?  Gentlemen.  The only reason I don't adopt animals is because whenever I get mad, I hit and kick them.  Oh, God.  Hey, I'm going to tell you a little story about a little dog named Chester.  Chester was a little dog.  And one day, there was this radio personality. 
[01:05:00]  I'll call Greg.  And Greg wanted to watch the basketball game.  Well, the Knicks were in the finals.  The Knicks were in the finals.  And he wanted to eat at the same time.  He had a beautiful, what was it called?  Prime rib.  Prime rib.  All laid out on a tray.  And he went upstairs to get himself a beverage.  And he had a big baked potato.  He went upstairs to get himself a beverage.  You listening, Marge?  I'm listening.  And then Chester's owner, a true animal lover, a true animal lover, heard some noise coming 
[01:05:30]  from downstairs and said, Chester, what are you up to?  And in a panic, Greg, this guy named Greg, ran downstairs in his horror to see Chester  eating the prime rib and potato on the floor.  He had knocked it over and put it on the floor.  Let's ask Marge.  Marge, in that situation, what should you do?  What would you have done?  Call the vet because he could have gotten a terrible stomach ache if he had the bone 
[01:06:00]  in his mouth.  That would have added to his discomfort.  So although I know that they meant it to be a good thing.  That's why she's not with a man.  Well, you know what?  He actually, Marge, he did call a vet.  It was a doctor, Martin.  Doc Martin, as he's known as, made a house call and did a little, I don't know, a little  exploratory on the dog's liver.  Okay.  And turned up.  Junior Child, though, he says. 
[01:06:30]  What?  Nothing anymore.  Save the liver.  What'd she say?  Hey, that's my thing.  God's sake.  Junior Child, the world famous chef.  Right.  What'd she say?  She always used to say every time she did a show about chicken.  And don't forget to save the liver.  Yeah, but why would she say that if it's about chicken?  Because the chicken liver.  Oh, die.  Who cares?  Anyway.  I'm just saying.  Oh, he got a stomachache, all right.  Yes, he did.  Inbred pest. 
[01:07:00]  Can I have two seconds?  Go ahead, Marge.  Talk.  Sure.  Anyway.  Well, the first thing is that Little Shelter is having a, we're selling tickets for a Harley  raffle.  Nice.  Look at you.  Right.  And I, when they kept on saying, when we're talking about this, they say,  Harley, Harley, and then they said, bike, bike.  I didn't know what they were talking about, but now I know.  How do you not know what a Harley or a bike is, Marge?  When they kept on a Harley bike, I thought they were talking about a two-wheeler. 
[01:07:30]  Oh, yeah, and you're used to things with, like, a sidecar.  You know what?  Two wheels, one giant wheel in the front and that little one in the back.  But now I know.  So here's the deal, guys.  If you want to know a bike.  You buy your first bike at the Wright Brothers Bicycle Shop.  That's right.  Did a shirtless Negro wheel it over to you without making eye contact?  As well, he shouldn't have.  He could have been shot for that.  I'm getting sad.  No, no, no, Marge.  This is a happy, fun show. 
[01:08:00]  Just think about a fire at that animal shelter.  They'll all be so trapped.  You want to buy...  Yelping for your help in the cattery.  In the cattery.  Hey, Marge.  Yes.  When it's time to break a hip, make sure your dog's on the way so you don't fall on top of him.  Yeah.  Why should he suffer?  Okay.  Thank you.  Do you have a dog...  Marge, do you have a doggery?  No, we have a...  What is the dog place called?  You know, kennels, real life rooms.  Why don't you guys come out and visit?  I love that.  Do you ever over your dog's foot with your little rascal? 
[01:08:30]  You know, I have to tell you.  Can I say Stern's name on here?  No.  No, that wouldn't be bad.  No.  No, come on.  No.  No.  You want to say Stern's name?  Howard Stern supports North Shore Animal League.  How about...  Does he?  No, he doesn't.  He has a broad that likes pets.  His broad does.  And now he has to support pets.  His broad does.  His broad has a dog that they dress up in little sweaters.  You think he likes that?  Do you think as a man, he enjoys that? 
[01:09:00]  It's just one of the things he has to do to get some poo-ha.  Pah-ree.  Pah-ha.  Well, tell me when I can go.  What?  No, you can't go yet.  All right.  Just tell me.  Do you want to be the people that life-saving celebrity couples...  You should pardon the expression.  Oh, I'm pardoning it.  Sorry, sorry.  I pardon you.  The shooter issue runs from the compound.  Yes.  Will help little shelter with the Harley raffle and help find animals' homes. 
[01:09:30]  Would you like...  Can I adopt you, both of you, to be the celebrity spokesperson for, sir, for hundreds of animals  that need homes?  Come on.  Howard does it for North Shore Animal League.  No, he doesn't.  He's got a broad.  I want to give generously to the cattery.  God.  Yeah, we want to bomb the cattery.  No, you're not bombing.  Actually, we've got an animal lover on the phone that wants to talk to Marge from Long 
[01:10:00]  Island.  Maybe this guy can help out.  It's Steve from Yellowstone.  Steve from Yellowstone.  You're on with Marge.  Hello.  Is this Marge?  Yes.  I really love what it is that you're doing for animals.  I think it's very important because so many people don't seem to realize that there's  a lot of animals out there that are in trouble.  And people like to make light of the whole thing, but it really is an important issue.  Bless your heart, Steve.  What's that? 
[01:10:30]  Bless your heart.  Would you help me sell some raffles?  Ramone!  The left side of Marge's body should shut down.  Oh, good God almighty.  Ramone!  I want to throw AIDS into the car.  I should have called Howard.  Ramone!  I once raped a small, sick dog.  All right.  Maybe I'll call Don.  Ramone!  Shut this talking corpse up! 
[01:11:00]  Steve?  Oh, my God.  I hope a sick doggy teeth-edged Marge!  Steve?  Bag it.  Ramone!  Tell this cat lady to hang herself!  Very nice.  Ramone!  I hope you're...  Help me, I'll be...  Help me!  ...in a home invasion!  Help me!  Ramone!  Shut this irrelevant old bag of meat up! 
[01:11:30]  Very nice.  I just think that a lot of people...  You know, I'm glad we...  ...we appreciate that there are animals in trouble.  I'm glad we didn't...  Ramone!  Leave it!  I'm glad we didn't do this on Monday.  This psychopathic bitch doesn't know that we're laughing at her!  All right.  That'll get ya.  Oh.  Oh.  Oh.  Marge?  Yes?  That was obviously a bad caller.  That was a prank caller.  That got through our screeners. 
[01:12:00]  Yeah, yeah.  That happens one time.  Yeah.  So, gentlemen, are you with me or again me?  With me?  Again me?  What are we?  The Civil War?  Again me?  Yeah.  I'm again you...  What the hell's again?  Again.  Against.  Oh.  Auntie.  Auntie.  Auntie.  People, give generously to the Little Shelter.  No, buy raffles.  Buy raffles.  Call Little Shelter.  Call Little Shelter.  6-3-1.  No, don't give out any phone numbers.  Go on our website.  All right. 
[01:12:30]  Is there any porn on that website?  Yeah, because we can't give out any pornography.  You know there's a cattery.  There's bound to be porn.  Hold on.  We do have a real animal lover on the phone.  His name is Travis from Riskless Omaha.  All right.  Travis.  Hello.  Yes.  Hi, Travis.  Hi.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I thought this was my show.  Hi, Marge.  Yes.  I think that a lot of people are going to make fun of you, but I think that what you're  doing, I don't want to stand the offensive, is really, it's God's work, and it's really 
[01:13:00]  important because there's so many sick animals that are being taken care of.  That's nice.  See, Marge, we have a heart.  Yeah, and our listeners can be intelligent.  Ramon!  Torturing small animals is hilarious!  Ramon!  Give me the Viagra so I can walk into the cattery!  All right, listen.  Ramon!  Why won't my...  All right, I'm calling Don on it. 
[01:13:30]  ...die already.  That's it.  Yeah, Marge.  Yes.  Hi, it's Don Imus.  Imus in the morning program.  You know, Don, do you remember that many years ago when you was with WNBC?  Yeah, yeah, back in the days of WNBC.  Yeah.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  You did a radio broadcast?  I did.  Yeah.  You brought in so many adopters. 
[01:14:00]  You were wonderful many years ago.  Yeah.  And I wish you'd come to Little Shelter now and do the same thing.  Doesn't it look like I got an old calico on my head?  Oh.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Like a calico cat on my head?  You know what?  Doesn't my neck look like a scratching post?  I know you really do love...  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I am busy.  I love cats.  Yeah.  Charles, on the other hand...  No, I didn't say I like cats.  I know.  I said something else similar.  I know, I know.  But, yeah, yeah.  I like them young, too. 
[01:14:30]  I bet I know.  I am busy.  How's Deirdre?  Just fine.  Yeah, dandy.  And what else is doing with your show?  Marge.  I know Opie and Anthony are leading you, making you look terrible.  Why don't you, um, uh, drop dead?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You're not the first person that's told me that.  Yeah.  You know, I like to say, um, a hundred is the new 90.  Because, uh, I'm old.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
[01:15:00]  Hey, Marge, are you wearing a cowboy hat?  Because I am.  I happen to think that, uh, you're a very attractive man.  I happen to think I don't care about you.  I like older men.  As you can understand.  Are you with me or again me?  Are you with me or again me, Don?  You're a jerk.  Thank you so much.  Shut up, McCord.  All right, Marge, we gotta go.  All right.  So are you gonna help, yes or no?  Um...  Come on, come on, come on.  Get a bigger shelter. 
[01:15:30]  Come on.  A little shelter.  Yeah, sure.  It should be called big shelter.  I used to drive past it all the time.  If you help the animals, God is gonna be so good to you.  All right, hold on a line.  We'll, uh, we'll get some info.  All right.  Yeah, you hold on.  All right.  Thank you, Darls.  All right, hold on.  There goes Marge from Long Island.  Boy, Ramone.  Ramone.  Sure got a load of her.  All right, we gotta take a break.  We're so late now.  What were we talking about?  Oh, the Maury thing and the pickles.  Yeah, we'll try to get into that next. 
[01:16:00]  It's the O&A virus spreading across America.  What happened to the potatoes?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  From O&A pictures.  You always liked potatoes.  That's not new.  A horrifying story.  Did he forget the potatoes?  Of a man.  I need the potatoes.  Without potatoes.  Danny, you forget the potatoes?  If it won't happen again, I can promise you it.  How far will one man go?  Well, I'm gonna have to wait for the potatoes.  For potatoes.  The potato diva.  My potatoes are here.  Come here.  Open your mouth.  Eat.  Eat.  Eat your potatoes. 
[01:16:30]  Eat.  That's the way to do it.  You say potato.  He says potato.  That's a big thing in potatoes, Danny.  Everything is delicious.  The potato diva.  I need the potatoes.  Yeah.  Coming soon.  I want potatoes, and I want eggs, and I want hot sauce.  God, you've gotten fat.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:17:00]  Jimmy's not happy.  Jimmy's not happy.  Hey, Al, you shouldn't have dumped.  Oh.  Read your own paper.  Things to dump.  You shouldn't have dumped.  A couple of little things dumped out of, uh...  They shouldn't have been.  That was the first appearance of, uh, Ramone on the commercial side of the Opie and Anthony  Show, commercial radio side.  Steve from Yellowstone.  Completely killed, and then we found out as we went to break that, uh, about eight seconds 
[01:17:30]  wasn't heard.  I like how Jimmy's sticking up for, uh, Steve from Yellowstone so much.  Yes.  Like that.  The caller, Steve, got dumped out of a couple of times, and Jimmy is really a...  It should not.  I got the rules right here in front of me.  If you're going to dump, fine.  Like, don't panic and do it when you shouldn't.  That bit killed, but every time they have to hit that button, you lose four seconds.  Did they hit it once or twice?  Twice.  So you lost eight seconds, Jimmy.  Oh.  Lost eight seconds, because they can't just dissect the, the, the problem area out. 
[01:18:00]  You just got to lump, lump out about four seconds of context.  Why twice?  Why twice?  Well, you know why.  I don't even know if he...  I don't.  I don't know why, because he was wrong.  The same thing I said...  No, I'm just saying, you know which ones he dumped out of, and we're saying that he  shouldn't have dumped on those two.  We will.  Oh.  That really, really makes me sick.  That was Radio Gold, too, and we lost eight seconds of it.  Radio Gold.  Moving on to other things.  Don't panic.  Tom's going to listen to it, by the way, Jimmy. 
[01:18:30]  Tom Chiasano will listen.  All week, but it's not going to matter, because that was Radio Gold.  Correct.  All week, send us your 30-second or less production piece about the Opie and Anthony show, and  Friday, we will select the best five entries.  You can win the all-new amazing iMac, Anthony.  To enter to win, go to 923freefm.com.  That's 9...  923...  Or, you know, the numbers.  923freefm.com.  By Thursday, 9 a.m.  Don't forget to check out the new iMac at apple.com, or head to the Apple Store and explore all 
[01:19:00]  your creative possibilities.  But basically, we've got five iMacs to give away.  Yeah, five.  And you just have to send in a production piece that has something to do with the Opie and  Anthony show.  Something to do with the show.  Something we've been talking about.  Yeah, get your production piece together, and then you'll be able to do all your later  production on the wonderful iMac.  There's only a couple days left in this promotion.  This is the type of promotion we should have done more than four or five days, by the way.  Yeah, maybe.  So, I mean, you've got a really good chance at getting an iMac if you just get something 
[01:19:30]  to us.  Something in.  I'm not even kidding.  Just produce something.  We've got four entries so far.  That means every one of these entries, we get an iMac.  You see what's going on here?  Yeah.  And they're average at best.  No offense to Matthew, but these are average at best.  Here's one of the entries that came in.  Okay.  Is it true that it was Employee Appreciation Day?  Employee Appreciation Day.  Not only did we not go, we weren't even invited. 
[01:20:00]  We are hurt and saddened.  The lack of an invitation speaks volumes.  Not only are we more famous than all of you, we also may be more famous.  Make a lot more money.  And it's high time.  We were recognized for it.  Currently, the Opie and Anthony Radio Empire.  Put that in your pipe and smoke it.  Yeah, see, now, it was high energy, had clips from the show, musical background, and zero interesting content. 
[01:20:30]  Yeah.  And they only got two days to get them in.  Why are we doing this contest for four days?  I don't know.  We still got to get things together.  Why can't we do it over a longer period of time?  Because then you would get a lot of really good entries.  Yeah, then we get some good ones.  And then it would be good stuff that we could play on our show.  So, we got a lot of hard work ahead of us.  Four days for this contest?  I mean, that's silly.  92.3 FreeFM.com. 
[01:21:00]  The number is 923 FreeFM.com.  It has all the contest rules and how you get your entries in, okay?  Here's the other one worth playing today, but barely.  And we're giving away five IMAX.  Five.  These do always get better over time.  That's why we kind of wanted more time.  The initial ones kind of stank.  And then they get better and better.  We're hoping for some good ones.  Opie and Anthony.  With Opie.  Go. 
[01:21:30]  Scroo.  Anthony.  The smartest man in the universe.  And we have to build moon bases.  And maybe Mars.  Maybe he's not that smart after all.  Tippy-tow.  The world of one.  We have to make it stop.  We'll change our light moon bases.  That's not too annoying at all.  Welcome to the opium.  Hey, man.  If you want to win it, I'm back.  It is beyond easy at this point.  Oh, hands down.  You just got to send something in. 
[01:22:00]  Pretty much just.  I think we might as well just hand them out on the sidewalk Friday.  Here's the next entry.  I want an eye back.  All right.  Send it out.  He wins.  Wow.  Somebody's not thinking.  Step it up, people.  But somebody.  You got to step it up.  Somebody's not thinking.  This contest should last like a month, not four days.  Some really good things going.  All right. 
[01:22:30]  Good luck to you.  Everybody involved.  Feeling a little better, Jimmy?  No.  I'm livid.  Jimmy won't feel better until Monday.  Maybe.  If we're lucky.  You know how hard it was to get a Steve from Yellowstone that I knew I could do on this  one and I didn't want it that people at XM would enjoy?  XM got to hear all of it.  Yeah.  You know.  That's a good commercial for XM today.  They heard it all.  They heard the eight seconds that were dumped out of.  They should have been dumped.  Whatever.  I mean, it's not as bad as it used to be because I know we got XM to go to and I know I could. 
[01:23:00]  You know what I mean?  It's like that's what makes it bearable.  Yeah.  It's just like, ugh, ugh.  Two questionable dumps and it was radio gold.  Both wrong.  If it's just a chatter thing that's going on between us, like boring chatter or who cares,  chatter and he dumps out twice, whatever.  But when it's in the middle of radio gold, that's when it gets really frustrated.  That's when you really got to be on your game back there.  Absolutely, man.  That's when you got to really, really focus because you're really screwing up the creative  process.  And I think they put soy milk in my coffee and I just want to throw it at somebody. 
[01:23:30]  Can anything go right for Jimmy today?  I submit to you, no.  I'm going to do my monologue tonight in acting class.  I know I'm going to suck.  You got your acting class tonight?  Why are you still taking acting class?  You can act.  I don't know.  You watch Lucky Louie?  You can.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to laugh so hard.  I'm way too eager.  I finally waited to laugh at this laugh.  You can act.  Do you watch it?  Do you critique yourself when you watch yourself?  Yeah.  I'm happy with actually most of it.  The coffee's wrong.  Oh, Jesus. 
[01:24:00]  He puts soy milk in there and he's going to say he didn't and I'm there.  Here.  Who got it?  Here, your turn.  Child's.  Oh, no.  Let me walk over to you.  I don't want to throw it.  Watch out.  Don't get any on the...  I want you to slam it.  Okay.  Here, take the garbage.  Thanks.  It's one of those days.  It's one of those days.  Oh, this is going to go all over me.  No, it won't.  I hope.  No.  You can only hope.  Dude.  No, I'm not to be...  What kind of milk did you put in here?  Not to be hurt.  What?  Get on mic.  What happened, child star?  Get on mic.  Former child star, everyone.  I thought you said soy milk, but I...  Because usually you do get soy milk in some stuff, so I assumed you did and... 
[01:24:30]  Okay.  Cool.  Thanks.  Sorry.  God, the panic.  Thanks, man.  I'll give you an up.  I appreciate it.  Thank you.  God, the panic.  These guys just want to intern and learn a little bit about radio.  How about a medium iced latte with soy?  Thank you.  God.  His face.  He was in major panic mode.  These poor kids are just interning.  They want to learn a little bit about the radio biz.  That's why...  I do.  I thought...  Because you had to ask for stuff with soy milk, and I thought he was panicked.  As I'm watching this poor dude talk, and I know I do get soy in my one and my skip... 
[01:25:00]  I'm thinking, if I were him, I would throw something at me.  Did you have a little moment there where you thought...  I just didn't want to see him.  You switched positions with him and...  Yeah, because he was like, oh, sorry.  I thought it was like, all right.  This is the hardest show to intern for.  We're a bunch of asses.  And then we got, like, professional killers around us.  Then you got Steve.  You never know what he's going to do at any moment.  I want to submit to everybody that I am nice. 
[01:25:30]  I don't think one intern has a complaint about me.  You're neither nice or not nice, by the way.  Yeah.  Because you have to interact with humans to actually have someone have that opinion on you.  I don't even know their names.  I know you don't.  You know former child star?  Yeah.  How long has he been with the show?  He's been with us a while now.  I don't know what his name is.  I honestly tell you, I have no idea what his name is. 
[01:26:00]  His name is former child star.  That's his nickname.  Yeah, but shouldn't you know his real name?  Why?  No?  Nickname's good enough, right?  Like, if you're being, like, a nice guy or courteous or whatever.  But I don't know their names.  I just feel bad for these guys.  They're all panicky.  John, without the H, J-O-N.  I hate John, without the H.  I like him, but I hate the name spelling.  Put an H in it, you faggot.  J-O-N.  It's quick and fast.  Don't dump out of that. 
[01:26:30]  I just spelled John.  Well, it was a context.  Slang for a bathroom.  Watch how you use that.  Or it could be a guy picking up a prostitute.  We don't like that type of talk over here.  Oh, boy, gosh, good golly.  Are we going to get to the pickle story or what?  Please.  Are we going to get to some pickles?  A girl scared of pickles on Maury Povich.  18-year-old girl named Mariah hates pickles and everything about them.  The whole world eats pickles, but it's ruining her life. 
[01:27:00]  She's teased in school, and she, of course, in school was called the pickle girl.  You know, once you know, this is what the sight of a pickle does to Mariah.  My name is Mariah, and I hate pickles.  I hate everything about it.  Pickles are destroying my life.  I'm so ashamed.  I'm afraid of everything about pickles.  I just want to throw up and run away.  What I hate most about the pickle is the shape, the texture of it. 
[01:27:30]  Oh, boy.  All right.  This has nothing to do with pickles.  You know what?  Nothing at all to do with a cucumber that has been soaked in brine.  There are times we just have to leave our posts and allow you to continue at the radio show.  So you continue in your head for a moment.  We'll wait.  Okay, go ahead.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Exactly.  I don't like pickles because I don't know why, but they remind me of whiskey being breathed 
[01:28:00]  through the side of my face.  Yes.  When I eat them and I just, she obviously, if you don't like pickles, you would be like,  ugh, I ate a pickle once, the taste, yeah, yeah, no, I don't like pickles.  Yeah.  You don't go, the shape.  And the texture.  The talking in your ear that goes on when you're eating one.  The threats to your little dog.  Oh. 
[01:28:30]  The whole room full of pickles because, you know, he had to invite other people over.  And the cracker just sitting there.  Yeah.  Well, the next clip, Maury sends Mariah to a pickle factory.  Oh, that'll do it.  See, this is 38 seconds of her just freaking out over pickles.  This doesn't help, Maury.  It helps his ratings. 
[01:29:00]  Let's get people that are afraid of things and just send them there.  You hate pickles, don't you, sweetie?  Well, we're going to help you.  We're going to help you out.  Do we have any green body paint around here?  Because I want to pull a gag on this bitch.  Oh, God damn, Maury, man.  We wanted to see firsthand the extent of Mariah's pickle phobia.  So we sent her to the Patterson Pickle Factory, 
[01:29:30]  where she would come face to face with thousands upon thousands of pickles.  I don't want to see him.  I don't want to see him.  I don't want to see him.  I don't want to see him.  I don't want to see him.  No, no, no, no.  I love this.  It's taking me. 
[01:30:00]  It's going to my stomach.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I made a mistake.  That was audio from the Duke Lacrosse team.  I miscued the CD.  Please tell me they threw her on a pool table and made her hold a pickle in each hand.  This is so far from a fear of pickles.  The girl needs some serious help.  Not Maury Povich. 
[01:30:30]  She's losing her mind at a pickle factor.  Oh, Maury tries to get to the bottom of it.  Yeah, I bet he does, and that's when she really freaks out.  He has to tell her to stop shaking.  Stop shaking so much.  And this is our little secret, the trip to the pickle factory.  Don't tell your mother.  How is Maury going to get her into, you know, liking pickles?  Maybe start with a little gherkin.  Start with a gherkin. 
[01:31:00]  How about a sliced piece?  The ones you find on a hamburger.  Yeah.  Stop eating them whole, this.  Yeah, the way they're sliced up for the burgers.  Yeah, they're fine that way.  I like the taste, and they're like, there you go.  How about bananas?  Oh, I hate getting the bananas.  Yeah.  Don't take her to the plantation, the banana plantation.  This poor girl.  I imagine that eggplants were just driver insane.  I mean, when did this all start? 
[01:31:30]  When I was really little.  Yeah.  I couldn't stand them.  You couldn't stand them?  No.  Well, a lot of kids don't like pickles.  And they just don't like pickles, but they, they don't look, I mean, just because I, they  don't do this.  Huh?  You've got to get over this, right?  Maury gets to the bottom of the issue.  Do you have nightmares about pickles?  Oh, that was, I used to.  Stop, stop shaking.  Thank you. 
[01:32:00]  Please tell me that was Michael J. Fox you were talking to.  Wow.  All right.  We can't read half this crap.  Did he?  No, I'm just saying that.  All right.  Sorry.  Listening.  Wait, what does this mean?  It's a typo.  Maury, of course, has to, oh, bring out probably?  Bring out hundreds of pickles.  Yeah.  There's a beep in this clip, but that was from the Maury Poets show. 
[01:32:30]  We have nothing to do with this, uh, the beep in this clip.  All right.  Shakia and Louise have confronted their phobia.  Didn't like it.  You're going to have to confront yours.  You've got to see a pickle.  No.  You've got to see a pickle.  Can we have a pickle, please?  No.  Or two.  No.  Or ten.  Stay there. 
[01:33:00]  Stay there.  Stay there.  What a stick.  You eat that pickle.  Eat the pickle.  Eat the pickle.  Eat it with two hands.  Yeah.  It all goes back to all those years ago when you were at that party, the man in the Kermit  costume.  No.  You stay there.  He's yelling at her.  Yeah.  What a cook.  Shakia and Louise have confronted their...  I screwed up.  We're going to start over.  I'm sorry. 
[01:33:30]  Didn't like it.  You're going to have to confront yours.  You've got to see a pickle.  No.  Can we have a pickle?  No.  No.  Or two.  No.  Or ten.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  Say that.  Say that.  Mariah.  Mariah.  Where's Mariah? 
[01:34:00]  I don't have anything.  I don't have anything.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  No.  You have to confront them.  You know, Gary's going to have to, you know, he has to understand where you're coming  from.  All right?  Okay.  Okay, let's go back up.  Let's go back up.  Maury's starting to sound like a villain from, like, a Batman movie.  Don't move.  Where's Mariah?  I'm Pickle Man. 
[01:34:30]  Where's Mariah?  Right.  She was traumatized right there.  Yeah.  She was completely traumatized.  Like, she won't forget that.  And what the hell?  What would she look like?  Sam?  Anyone?  Uh.  She was a regular looking girl.  Regular looking?  How old?  18.  18?  Jesus.  She actually lost her shoes when she was running around.  Maury's studio.  I fell into the brine and my shoes fell off. 
[01:35:00]  My shoes because the pickles were chasing me.  Maury the Pickle Man.  And I'm very injured.  He said awful things to me.  His words hurt me.  And the pickles.  Oh.  They chased her with pickles.  Maury.  That is some fine audio.  Bravo to the guys.  And you know, Maury.  We know him.  We know Maury.  He's been on the show many times. 
[01:35:30]  He, uh...  The last thing on Maury Povich's mind during this segment was helping this girl get over  her fear of pickles.  The last thing.  If I'm, you know, if I even have to tell anybody this.  He wanted to freak this girl out because she was so afraid of pickles.  That is gold to Maury.  Loves it.  It'll make his best of shows.  Poor girl.  All right.  Well...  She needs some real professional help.  Yeah.  We have to take a break. 
[01:36:00]  It's the one-day virus spreading across America.  Could Sam Champion have a more feminine stance?  That's not Sam Champion.  Who is that?  No.  That's, uh, Nick Gregory?  Whoever it is.  Nick Gregory?  Ugh.  Um, oof.  Who are the Dootsons?  I believe they're the European jackasses.  Okay.  Oh, I think I read an article on these guys in FHM or, or Max in one of those magazines. 
[01:36:30]  They're all kind of the same to me.  One guy's missing a thumb.  I shook his hand.  Why?  Why is he missing a thumb?  I don't know.  Maybe he did a stunt.  Who knows?  Are they going to do something crazy for us today?  Lost a thumb after wrestling a wild Arctic bear.  Really?  Yeah.  And what?  The bear just bit it off?  I don't know.  Bit, clawed, whatever.  All right.  We'll talk to these guys next.  Well, you know what?  Maybe we can have him at the ONA Village during the traveling virus.  Uh, as part of the, uh, yeah.  As part of our comedy show, we're doing the ONA Village, yes.  What are they doing for us today, though? 
[01:37:00]  I don't know.  They got a couple stunts planned.  I'll be hiding in the other room because I don't watch that freak stuff.  You have to to protect us.  You have to save me.  Yeah.  They're going to have darts and stuff.  You have to protect us.  You might have pickles.  You have to be here.  Because what if there's a problem?  Who else we got?  Are we a fan?  What do you do?  Right.  Can someone find out what they're going to do for us today?  And we'll, uh...  I heard human dartboard and some kind of rubber band stuff.  I don't know exactly.  All right.  Cool.  Uh, who the heck is on the line?  Who the heck?  How's it going, guys?  Hey.  Hi. 
[01:37:30]  Show me how you eat a dill pickle.  Show me how you eat a dill pickle.  Spit your gum out.  That guy with the bear, is that Claude Balls?  Dude.  Oh.  Wah, wah, wah.  That old gag.  What did he say?  Uh, Fontaine.  Beautiful for girls.  Eat pickles.  Hey, boys.  Hey.  Wah, wah, pickles.  And we'll leave that right there.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America.  Hey, you're listening to the Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:38:00]  Yep.  Okay.  You're checking out the Opie and Anthony Show.  The studio's getting very, very crowded right now.  We're getting mics for everybody.  There's a guy walking around with, uh, with no thumb, shaking everyone's hand.  Hands, uh, except for Anthony.  Did you shake his hand, Ant?  Yeah, I choked.  I choked. 
[01:38:30]  You're all freaked out.  I shook thumbless guy's hand, of course.  Jimmy, uh, let everyone in what, what Ant was doing during the break.  And the guy's walked in, germaphobe, gets up off his chair and cowers in between the two  consoles on my right and just kind of not reads the paper.  I was taking a little stroll because I knew we had a lot of time that, uh, that break.  Yeah.  So I was stretching my legs.  Just wanted to stand in a quarter.  I don't know what they do.  I thought there was more than...  I don't know, like... 
[01:39:00]  Perkele, there is four of us and a 600-pound pet pig.  Yeah.  Named Brittany, he's actually a transsexual pig.  Really?  Yeah.  Wait, who are you guys, by the way?  We don't even know who you are yet.  Oh, we're the dudes from Finland, all the way from the Arctic Circle.  Yeah, and actually, I think Anthony stole Yarpy's thumb.  Yes, give it a fact.  I did not steal Yarpy's thumb.  Yarpy's thumb.  Yeah, it is.  Yarpy's thumb.  It's the true story.  He's stuck it up his butt and it's still there.  Oh. 
[01:39:30]  It's throwing hemorrhoids, living its own life in Yarpy's ass.  Ah, right.  Hope, uh, people enjoyed that.  Yeah, well, now you're, uh...  You should be telling that to everybody.  Well, and most people didn't hear because of what you just said.  We here in the warmer climates have rules and regulations on the radio,  some of which, you know, can't get too graphic with where thumbs go and things like that, you know.  But you're in Finland, we don't really have that censorship, so...  No, no, lucky you.  That was beautiful when we got our feature film in Finland. 
[01:40:00]  I could actually do a stunt called Testicle Mousetrap on air.  Oh, yeah.  And they showed it.  I couldn't even dream it in the wettest dreams I've ever had  that I have balls the size of that on the pool screen.  Was that also a bad word?  How much dump we got left?  How about you...  How about at this point you guys just stop talking?  Yeah, because...  You're dumping out like crazy.  You could just get ripped off the air at any moment.  You're talking about thumbs disappearing somewhere, let's just say.  You're talking about, uh, mousetraps to parts of the body.  Yeah. 
[01:40:30]  You can't say...  Let's be very...  You know what it is with America?  Broadcast, they get very uptight these days.  All right.  Very crazy.  Like, in your country, I'm sure that's all well and fine.  Then again, it's freezing cold there, right?  Yeah, that's why...  People are more concerned with keeping warm  than what they're hearing on the radio.  I think it's my...  My head is still frozen for spending 25 years in Finland,  freezing my...  Freezing your...  We got to see.  You're learning.  You're learning.  That's why you have to come up with this weird idea, 
[01:41:00]  just to warm you up.  Yeah.  Kim and Dartport right here.  All right, let's see if Tim Moore...  Hold on, we don't even know.  You guys are the Dudesons?  Yeah, the Dudesons from the Arctic Circle.  And you're going to be on Spike TV or something like that?  Yeah, 6th of July, 10 p.m., Spike TV airs our TV show,  and 11th of July, the Dudesons movie came out on DVD.  And it's kind of like Jackass?  Yeah, it's Jackass, but actually Steve-O and Pat Marger  from Jackass are big fans of us,  and we really took it to the next level  with actually having a real story behind it, 
[01:41:30]  and it's everything from human dartboard  to testicle mousetrap  and to accidentally burning our house down, so...  Accidentally burned...  Leaving people on fire.  It's Arctic mayhem.  Arctic mayhem.  All right, do you guys know Def Leppard?  Yeah.  Yeah, they rock.  Berserker.  I believe they're thrilled to be in the same room as you guys.  Would you like to make the...  You have no idea.  Yeah, Joe Elliott...  They're actually like the future of human dartboard. 
[01:42:00]  No, they don't need to...  See, they don't need to do human dartboard.  Oh, yeah, they have talent.  They got an actual talent.  You're right.  At least you got a sense of humor.  They don't need to do any crazy stuff like that.  We always wanted to be a rock band, but as you can see, none of us can play or sing or none of that,  so we had to do something.  Right.  We started headbanging, but we started headbanging on the wall.  Ah, see?  Headbanging.  Headbanging on the wall.  Headbanging.  It's not a word.  All right.  Behind you, of course, Joe Elliott and Phil Collin from Def Leppard. 
[01:42:30]  Of course.  And we had to get everyone in the room at the same time because we're running out of show here.  So you guys said you would watch, but you wouldn't participate, right, Joe?  I don't even think I want to watch now.  Yeah.  Tell us what happened.  Show them the...  That's the human dartboard right there.  No, you've got a...  Is that a tattoo?  That's a...  Well, not yet.  See, you guys...  I paint this in a permanent marker, and every time Yuka hits me with a dart, it's a one 
[01:43:00]  mark to my tattoo.  Oh, so it kind of like tattoos it as you put the dart in there, right?  Long way to go, let's say that.  I'm pretty bad at darts.  Once I throw them into the nipple...  Oh, that'll hurt.  And also, once I hit the bullseye, the belly button, you should have seen his face then.  That, I bet, hurts a lot.  He's a thumbless guy with a fat stomach.  Why not just throw the tattoo?  All right.  Hold on.  What happened?  Just throw the tattoo gun instead.  See what happened.  And how did you lose your thumb for real? 
[01:43:30]  Oh, that was a bear attack back in Finland.  But I think one thing about Finnish bears is that they have this Mike Tyson complex.  Whenever they're losing, they start biting.  So it bit my thumb up.  Whenever they start losing, you know...  And he's doing that old gag.  The comic angle isn't really translating with the American audience.  You know, the bear joke and everything.  Starts biting.  Give two thumbs up. 
[01:44:00]  But that's okay, as long as you, you know...  Two thumbs up.  Two thumbs up.  Wow.  Now, what happened with the bear?  These guys are hacks.  What happened with the bear?  Oh, I killed him.  I made a boot out of him.  To you.  I have nice bear boots.  I don't have them on right now.  I'm not small nowadays.  I see.  But you were fighting with...  Did he jump out in the wild?  Or were you doing a stunt with him?  In the wild.  In the wild.  You were just kind of roaming around, and a bear came out, and...  Yeah, I was roaming around.  He took my thumb, Charlie.  He took my thumb, Charlie. 
[01:44:30]  Anthony Pawley from New Rochelle.  Yeah.  Nice line, Leif Erikson.  I couldn't get it out.  Leif Erikson.  And Kenny has an observation.  Where's Kenny?  Club Soda Kenny.  The big stupid guy.  Get a mic.  Yes.  They're two wild and crazy guys.  There goes Griffey.  Look at him.  They got him.  Or is it?  No, it's off the wall.  My mistake.  Yeah.  All right.  So what's the first trick?  All right.  Yeah, yeah. 
[01:45:00]  We're kind of running out of time.  And we want to talk to Def Leppard a little bit here.  We've got a giant rubber band.  We're going to put it around my body, pull it, and whack it.  In Finland, it hurts twice as bad because it's so cold during the wintertime.  So your skin is all freezing.  Right.  But I think we can use some help on this one.  And you know how in school, when you take a rubber band and you slap somebody, it hurts.  It hurts a lot.  Now, that's a huge piece of elastic or rubber.  I like the color.  It's like a rubber band.  It looks like pink panties.  You couldn't come up with a better colored rubber band thing? 
[01:45:30]  That's highly visible.  I don't think your mic's working.  Who wants to pull it up?  Oh, not me.  Club Soda Kenny?  Steve C.  Club Soda Kenny will do it.  Club Soda Kenny.  All right.  By the way, we're getting video for the website.  Here we go.  All right.  Pull it.  No, no.  You've got to go that way.  You've got to pull it more.  Yeah.  Go to this side.  All right.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Hold on.  Don't let go yet.  Don't let go.  Hold on.  We've got to explain.  This rubber band device is stretched out about 10 to 12 feet. 
[01:46:00]  All right.  Let's do it.  All right.  This is going to be on video.  Former child star.  You've got to get a good shot of this.  All right.  He's the biggest guy in the studio.  All right.  Listen for the snap.  One, two, three.  All right.  That had to hurt.  Yuka's whining.  You've got to be impressed with that, Joe.  Come on.  That hurts.  That hurts.  That really had to hurt.  One more time.  One more time.  One more time. 
[01:46:30]  Wow.  That had to hurt.  All right.  No.  Kenny's an animal.  Sun-tack him.  All right.  Hold on.  These kittens will be proud one day.  Wait.  Okay.  His mic wasn't working.  No.  So if you want to really impress us, pull your pants down and lower the band.  Yeah.  Lower it down a little bit.  I wouldn't be proud of that.  Look at the marks on his gut.  Yeah.  Wow.  I was really giving you a pink belly there.  You know. 
[01:47:00]  That's got to hurt.  Stupidity has no limits.  Stupidity has no limits.  Kenny can pull that thing pretty far there, right?  Of course he can.  Yeah.  He can.  I think it's about time to whip out the darts.  All right.  All right.  The belly.  Throw a few darts at his belly.  Once again, it's the Dudesons.  It's going to be on Spike TV.  Kind of like Jackass.  July 6th, 10 p.m.  Spike TV and the DVD.  The original hardcore movie where we can show everything.  It's uncensored.  It's out on July 11th.  What's on the movie?  The Dudesons movie.  No.  What is it, though? 
[01:47:30]  What's on that?  Four lifelong friends living their crazy and hilarious life at the Arctic Circle with  a 600-pound pet pig, Brittany.  Who's actually the looks and the brains of the crew.  You guys need an opening act or something, Joe?  Phil?  Not right now.  Why isn't Joe's mic work?  Why would his mic work?  Sure.  Get him a mic.  Does that work?  Yeah.  They're legends and they're talking into mics that don't work.  That's smart.  That's nothing new.  We're fine for opening acts right now. 
[01:48:00]  Yeah, all right.  Let's go.  Usually when the Dudesons are in studio, mics are not working anymore.  We might just lit a fire in here at some point.  A lit a fire?  Yeah.  All right.  They're going to do the darts now.  That's actually what happened with our house.  We're barbecuing indoors.  So which one of these stunts hurts the most?  The darts to the gut or the rubber band trick?  I hate the rubber band trick because it's actually something that waxes you so bad and you  can't do anything about it.  And it's not fair to call it the rubber band trick because it's a lot bigger. 
[01:48:30]  It's a giant hickey, you know, on your belly after doing the rubber band stand.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's an oversized rubber band.  Let's just.  All right.  Let's see what you do with the darts now.  I'm not sure if you're just going to hit, but I'm still going to turn my back to you guys.  No.  Sorry.  How about that way?  Yeah, that's good.  That way.  I would never, ever want to be in the line of fire with those darts.  Come closer.  I'm not that good on a thrower. 
[01:49:00]  Come closer.  Arctic AIDS.  Be closer.  All right.  You know.  Y'all.  We are crazy guys.  I see.  Say first.  Cover your balls.  All right.  You guys ready for the human dartboard, huh?  Oh, absolutely.  It is mounting.  All right.  One, two, three.  Oh.  Oh, he throws.  Right in his fat stomach.  I think that's five points.  He throws up pretty hard.  All right.  The bullseye is the belly button.  All right. 
[01:49:30]  Second one.  Go already.  One, two, three.  Oh, God.  He hit him in the chest.  Oh, that's great.  You know you have, like, organs in there?  All right.  One, two, three.  Oh, man.  Dude, you could have at least gotten somebody who can throw darts.  I'd be really impressed if he did this trick with magic jogging first.  One, two, three. 
[01:50:00]  Oh.  You suck.  You have a two-top belly.  These guys are right.  He completely missed and hit him right in the sternum.  Last try.  Last try.  Here we go.  That one's dull.  I don't think we get the idea.  Yeah.  Really?  Thank you.  That's five points.  One on the chest and one on the belly.  Here's my dartboard.  Well, you lose all the points because of this chest hit.  What's the guy's thing?  Yeah, the one in his chest. 
[01:50:30]  Perhaps he should go to the hospital.  Yeah.  Do you guys have any other tricks or is that it?  That could be a heart wound.  I hope.  That's it?  It's sticking in my bone.  All right.  Yeah, pull that one out of your chest.  I want to see the stream of blood come from your aorta because that is...  I don't have a plot circle.  No plot.  Is it bleeding?  He's pulling them out now.  Yeah, that's starting to leak a little bit.  Very good. 
[01:51:00]  A little bit of gut showing.  You need a little more practice.  Well, that's pretty impressive, guys.  Yes.  The Dudesons, right?  D-U-D-E-S-O-N-S, something like that?  Yeah, dot com.  Dot com?  Check it out.  All right.  And it's going to be on Spike TV.  Yes, Kenny.  For the last trick, they're going to make themselves disappear.  That old gag is a favorite, Kenny.  Gentlemen, thank you so much for stopping in.  Yeah, we were impressed.  Definitely.  It was so pleasant. 
[01:51:30]  We were definitely impressed.  If you want to practice that human dartboard, I see two future human dartboards right there.  Oh, ho, ho, ho.  Wow.  Thank you, sirs.  Woo!  Very, wow.  Cool.  I don't know what to make of that.  Peace.  There they go.  You're right, though, man.  You guys smoke a lot of pot?  No.  No?  Not anymore?  You're not allowed to?  We drink reindeer blood.  What?  We drink reindeer blood.  You drink reindeer blood? 
[01:52:00]  We enjoy it.  What does that do?  Get back on mic.  Should I give you a buzz?  Do you really drink reindeer blood?  Yeah, that's our favorite drink in Finland.  Reindeer blood.  And what does it do?  That's kind of like red wine.  Kind of like red wine.  I might think of a hundred of them.  I can't.  And also, I mean, Rudolf the Red Nose, he tastes pretty good.  So every Christmas we eat reindeer.  Right.  And we drink reindeer blood.  Why did I ask him back?  Why did I ask him back in?  We sing the song Rudolf the Red Nose.  I thought I could get another minute out of him. 
[01:52:30]  And you know, after you eat Rudolf and you take a poo, it glows in the dark.  Of course.  Go ahead.  Go on.  Leave.  Leave.  All right.  All right.  The Dudesons.  The Dudesons.  They're a trip, actually.  Yeah.  Oh, jeez.  What do you guys think?  Anything?  I think I want to go to bed.  Joe's like, I got up for this crap.  All right.  We got to take a quick break.  We're going to talk to Def Leppard next, right?  Yes.  See what they're up to.  And that's that.  It's the ONA virus spreading across America. 
[01:53:00]  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hi, Ma.  Ma, I'm working.  I'll call you back, okay?  Love you, too.  Welcome to the Opie and...  Hello?  Hello?  Ma, I'm working.  I will call you back.  Welcome to...  Ma, let me work.  Welcome to the Opie and Anthony Show.  Whew.  Finally.  The Opie and Anthony Show. 
[01:53:30]  It's been a weird show today.  The Opie and Anthony Show.  The ONA virus spreading across America.  The Dootsons are gone.  They have left the building with all their hack jokes.  The audience just calling them the Dooshons.  The Dootsons from Munaki.  You think they were trying to impress us with that comedy?  Oh, they were firing them out, too.  They were.  He would do a joke and then push his chest out. 
[01:54:00]  Those jokes were so incredibly bad.  Like, there was no humor in them whatsoever.  No.  Let's just get to this rubber band.  You just can't buy talent like that.  No.  No.  You know what I mean?  No.  It's rare that something of that quality comes in and gets stuck with the bottom of your  shoe looking at the end.  I apologize that we bumped you guys for the Dootsons.  I mean, we didn't do that on purpose.  I'm insulted.  Actually, we've got some tricks we're going to do as well.  But we are going to pull our pants down. 
[01:54:30]  Yeah.  All the wacky horns.  Wacky horns.  No, everyone showed up at the same time.  And I was like, maybe these guys, you know.  No, in fairness, they are a little bit different.  I mean, this is your standard two guys from a band interview.  That's what I was thinking.  You've got two guys throwing darts at each other and talking about putting their wedding  tackle in mousetraps.  There's something not right about that.  Stupid me.  I'm thinking you guys have done a million radio interviews.  So maybe they would like to see something a little different before we talk a bit.  I'm actually glad that I can take that image to my grave. 
[01:55:00]  Yeah.  I'm glad we can offer that to you.  The oversized rubber band thing was the real deal, though.  The mark on his belly was pretty impressive.  Yeah, with big dopey Kenny pulling it back.  Yeah.  So we got Joe Elliott and Phil Collin in studio.  Def Leppard, of course, they're playing at the Art Center tonight.  Legendary status, you guys, now.  You think so, huh?  Yeah.  You've been around long enough.  I mean, still putting out good music.  Yeah, we've been around a quarter of a century.  Quarter of a century.  Ouch.  Yeah.  Do you ever think that? 
[01:55:30]  Something like that.  25 years sounds better.  When you used to sit there and watch your videos with your swords, man, and chicks in cages.  Oh, we still do that.  Did you used to think, like, 25 years later?  The swords, we don't need reminding of.  The swords.  The swords are a bit more like the dorksons or whatever.  Dude, that was cool, man, back then.  What are you kidding?  Everyone loved the Def Leppard videos back then.  It had all the features.  They only got better, you know, and videos improved in the 80s and the 90s.  And in the 80s, people were still just filming them on. 
[01:56:00]  Yeah, well, the technology just to tape them back then was pretty much what anyone...  No one had a real idea.  They just said, roll camera.  We'll make something happen.  See, when we first saw the scene where Phil's guitar, when the sword turned into Phil's  guitar, I remember thinking, wow, it's just like Star Wars.  It was that cool.  Now it's more like, it's like the porn film where the guy gets his toes cut off all the  you were talking about earlier on.  But we're not embarrassed about it.  That's the funny thing.  No, no.  Well, you shouldn't be.  You shouldn't be.  No, no, no, no.  It totally fit the time. 
[01:56:30]  It was what was happening.  It did.  It totally fit the time.  No one looked at that, those videos back then, and went like, oh my God, unless you  came from the future, you know, and went back and go, boy, are they going to laugh at  this?  You know, it fit the time perfectly.  MTV and stuff.  It was such a part of MTV.  You would sit around and wait for like one of your guys' videos to come on.  There were very few bands that you would wait for their videos to come on.  And Def Leppard was absolutely one of them, you know, and you guys had quite a few of  them.  Yeah, we had a few.  Yeah.  Four.  You ever see the video for Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath? 
[01:57:00]  They did like the 70s.  It was just Sabbath walking through the woods.  It was like, fur coats.  It was really cool.  Like, what the hell is that about?  The camera's like zooming in and out.  And you're like, all right, I guess that was pretty cool.  Nothing.  The Blair Witch Project.  There you go.  Exactly.  Wow.  Nothing was worth it.  Before MTV, there was like this, I guess they still made videos, but they didn't know what  to do with them.  So they used to show up on like Don Kirshen's rock concert.  Yeah, they were called promo films.  Yeah, promo films.  But the bands didn't know what to do, either.  No.  I remember seeing old Stones one. 
[01:57:30]  They were lost.  I was like, hang on a minute.  What are we doing?  Yeah.  Everyone.  And everyone had the, every one of them had like the kaleidoscope effect.  Absolutely.  And you know on bad form films where you see the girl, you know, wherever she's with the  pig or on the mattress, look into the side of the camera for direction.  Yeah.  Looking for a little help here.  That's what the guys used to do in the 60s and 70s when they shot videos, too.  There's a beauty for the Kinks.  The Kinks did one for a song called Dead End Street, where they're carrying this coffin  out of this little terrace house in England, all wearing top hats and looking like undertakers. 
[01:58:00]  And they're just carrying a coffin, and that's all it is.  It's just that sped up.  And that's it.  Somebody came up and said, you've got this great idea for a film, guys.  It kind of makes the guitar sword thing look like Star Wars.  That was when it reached the level where it was like, wow, people, even though it was  that, people are going, hey, they're putting some production values in these things.  They've got chicks with swords turning into a guitar.  I think it started kicking in at Bo Rap when Queen made Bo Me Rhapsody.  Yeah, yeah.  They totally kicked it up another gear.  I remember, though, watching things like Don Kersner. 
[01:58:30]  And what an awful guy to host a rock show.  Because he'd just sit there and go, and now I'd like to intro you to Casey and the Sunshine  Band.  We don't know who Don Kersner is.  So to us, he was cool.  Because all we ever got were these bootleg tapes of people like Mott the Hoople or Bowie.  You think, wow, we've got this show in America.  They show these people.  I thought Don Kersner was OK.  That was like the one in a million, though.  He was the only people that would show Bowie or Boston or whoever it was.  Because most of the times, you did get these one-hit wonders from back in the 70s. 
[01:59:00]  I'll tell you what, if they started re-showing them, everybody would start watching them  again.  Probably would.  Just to see.  I wonder where the hell those are.  I just got to send some in the mail, actually.  Black Oak.  Don Kersner is a rock.  Yeah, yeah.  They sent it to me.  It was great.  I remember watching Kiss when I was a kid.  They'd do, like, love them, leave them off rock and roll over.  I didn't know it was lip sync back then.  I'm like, they sound just like the record.  You ass.  There was the other one that, Midnight Special.  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Wolfman Jack used to host that one.  Yeah.  And it was another one of those rock and roll shows. 
[01:59:30]  He had a great voice, man.  Hey, everybody, we're going to bring out another band.  Yeah, are you?  You guys, though, with the videos, obviously, you lip sync that.  Isn't that?  You do?  It had to be rough.  Really?  That is rough.  For the videos.  Because you kind of probably feel silly.  No, you get used to it.  Do you?  But you hate it because you're sitting around in a trailer all day.  It's a long day.  I don't even mean so much now.  Like, when you first started doing videos, it must have been a little weird to go.  Because you didn't lip sync anything. 
[02:00:00]  Yeah, I tell you, when we first started doing videos, you're glad to be lip syncing because  you don't want to sing that thing for 12 hours.  Yeah.  You know, by the time you got the final take, you're like, you're bleeding from the throat.  You have no voice left, yeah.  You're on and stuff.  But we just shot one for Rock On in, like, this kind of old government facility about an  hour north of L.A.  And it really was like a cross between Lost and The Hills Have Eyes.  It was a gateway that you wouldn't look at twice if you're driving down this, like, canyon 
[02:00:30]  road.  But it was open.  So you're going through his gate.  So it looks a little bit like that scene from, what's that movie where the professor goes  and lives on an island?  Dr. Moreau.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Island of...  War Games.  Oh.  Oh.  War Games.  Oh, Joshua.  Boy, were we off.  There you go.  That was off too.  Yeah.  You've got this facility, right, and you drive up this hill and down this hill and through  this little street.  And there's just overgrown land.  And there's all these old buildings that haven't been used for 40 years. 
[02:01:00]  Graffiti all over them where skateboard kids are snucking at night.  Bullet holes everywhere, because it's where gangs would meet up and just...  Yeah.  And you're breathing bullet holes.  But it kind of smelled funny.  It smelled like you could imagine some guy getting dumped back on Sunset Boulevard on  a Monday, having been up there with electrodes on his head.  And, you know, some guy in a white coat.  Some kind of secret stuff going on, man.  Like, mentally for a weekend.  Yeah.  Just, there were old beds there.  Oh, we have one of those on Long Island.  That's cool.  Creepy.  Remember the one on Long Island? 
[02:01:30]  The psych...  Oh, yeah.  Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center.  Kings Park.  Yeah.  Used to take...  There was the one in Kings Park and then there was Pilgrim State.  And...  Those were the coolest places to hang out.  Yeah.  You used to go driving around.  The buildings are falling apart and stuff.  You would, you know, go for a little tour.  You're drinking or taking girls up there, because they'd get scared out of their minds.  And, like, they'd tighten up to you on the seat a little bit, you know?  You know, the last scene we shot was this bit where they had this huge wind machine.  It was the size of, like, a Jumbo Jet's propeller.  Well, they don't have propellers, do they? 
[02:02:00]  If they hit.  We knew what you were talking about.  Well, hey, listen, I come from England.  They have propellers.  And this fan was just blowing dirt and paper at us.  And you're kind of...  You're going, rock on.  And of course, the word on encourages you to open your mouth.  Right.  So there's, like, ducks and rats and cockroaches and, you know, bits of old people and stuff  flying through their mouth.  It was pretty sick.  Hey, we've got to go to the phones.  Rob in New York.  Hey, Rob, we're hanging out with Def Leppard.  What's up, Rob?  I saw this show on Saturday night at Jones Beach. 
[02:02:30]  Yeah.  The most incredible, phenomenal show I've seen in years.  These guys got all the energy of what they had back in the 80s and 90s.  Oh, cool, man.  Isn't that great, man?  I mean, because there are so many bands that, you know, still want to do it, can't do it.  Don't have...  You know, the singer doesn't have the pipes or, you know, they just don't have the passion  for it anymore.  Or they're just going through the motions to get the paycheck.  You guys still obviously love what you do.  Absolutely.  We paid Rob as well to phone in.  Yeah, but yeah.  We assumed.  No, we love it. 
[02:03:00]  Absolutely.  No, it's great.  And it's great that someone recognizes that.  Did you guys ever stop doing gigs and then start again?  No.  I think that's one of the reasons why we're having a good time right now.  You know, we're a real band.  We didn't go away and split up and reform.  None of that crap.  We're actually real and we've been doing albums, tours, album tours.  And I think it's come back and people go...  Yeah, they got a new CD out called Yeah.  Absolutely.  All new material.  Yeah, we only stopped doing gigs at 11 o'clock and then they start again the next day.  Yeah.  I saw you guys once at, I guess, National Coliseum and it was when you were doing the 
[02:03:30]  show on the round and they brought you out in, I guess, cases.  Laundry.  No, I used to get a laundry hamper.  Yeah, a laundry hamper.  It was something.  But everybody was kind of like, how are they going to get to the stage?  You know, it's like, how are they going to get to the stage?  And you'd see like a couple of roadies bringing some stuff out.  It's like, dude, I bet they're in the box.  Really?  In the box, dude.  And we were, but you'd be amazed.  There's another school of thought as well.  It's like, man, they've been under that thing since four o'clock.  Yeah, yeah.  Under the stage. 
[02:04:00]  There must be a whole city under there.  You know, we did one thing in Chicago.  We had split it up.  Me and Rick Savage, our bass player, we would be in one.  We got Robert Plant to push it out.  He put a baseball cap on and pushed it out.  And we were in again.  Wow.  Robert Plant pushing us out.  And no one knew.  No one knew?  In fairness, he had a big cushion shoved up his shirt so he'd look like a big fat road.  Yeah, yeah.  And the further he got to the stage and he didn't get recognized, because it was all for money.  You know, it's like 10 quid that you won't do it, Robert. 
[02:04:30]  It's 10 quid that I will.  And then he gets closer and closer to the stage.  He pulls the thing out.  Then he takes the hat off and starts preening the hair.  Yeah, the hair comes out.  He looks like Robert Plant.  Still nobody recognized him.  Wow.  And if they did, they went, it can't possibly.  Yeah, that's probably what it is.  It's so out of context.  That roadie looks like Robert Plant.  Yeah.  That roadie, man.  So, of course, I had to repay the compliment about a year later.  He was on tour.  And I went up to Albany to see him.  And he made me go out for a 10 quid bet and do a mic check in front of the entire crowd.  So, there's 10,000 people in Albany. 
[02:05:00]  And I'm going across all the mics going, one, two, one, two.  And nobody noticed.  No one noticed.  God damn.  How does that make you feel?  They don't expect you.  They don't look for you.  You should have just, like, broken a couple of lines in one of your songs.  Yeah.  Yeah, Mike.  Wow, that guy.  That sounds good.  Let's go to Lonnie in North Carolina.  Lonnie, what's up?  Hey, guys.  How y'all doing?  How's it going?  We got Joe Elliott and Phil Collin in studio.  Def Leppard.  Cool, cool.  I got a question for him.  I was watching this show on VH1 behind the music. 
[02:05:30]  And I was wanting to know if this story was true.  That back in the day, they used to, when they had the guitar solos, they'd go underneath the stage and have sex with the groupies.  Look, every day.  Every day.  All the time.  Do you honestly think they're going to deny that, even if it wasn't true?  Of course.  We didn't have to wait for the guitar solos.  My son, right, he's 16 now.  He came up to me, and about two years ago, he said, Dad, the kids at school said you were on Most Metal Moments.  You was having an orgy under the stage, and da-da-da. 
[02:06:00]  Did you?  And I said, well, you were there.  I said, you were two.  You were kind of like, do you remember an orgy under the stage?  And he's like, well, no, but I was only two.  You know, so he kind of...  Yeah, it gets a little carried away, the rumours.  But no, we didn't have the rumours great, but you've got to...  We like the rumours, and we don't deny them, but not true.  Yeah, of course.  Having a 16-year-old son, does he think Dad is cool?  Well, because every son doesn't think their dad's really cool, so how does that work if you're a rock star?  He does now.  I mean, right at the moment.  About eight years ago, probably not, but, you know, it just goes around. 
[02:06:30]  He likes corn and system of a down.  I remember being backstage in Boston.  It was Aerosmith.  No, it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers were playing, okay, and Dave Navarro was walking around.  And what's his name?  His son from Aerosmith was with his pop.  And he's like, Dad, it's Dave Navarro, like, freaking out because he's meeting Dave Navarro.  And I'm thinking, your father's an Aerosmith.  You know, that's a lot cooler than Dave Navarro.  You know what happened, which was really cool, actually?  Last year, he went to the Aerosmith, saw Maiden, Aussie, all of these guys. 
[02:07:00]  And, you know, he sees us all the time.  He comes out on tour with us.  Right.  I said, so how was it then?  He said, no, it's okay.  I said, that's because your dad's a legendary superstar in a real band.  And he goes, well, yeah, you guys are really good, actually.  That was the biggest compliment ever.  He finally admitted a little bit, like, all right, Dad, you're cool.  We do our thing.  We're one of the only bands I know who actually really sing.  We don't use tapes and samples and stuff.  Who's doing that?  Everyone else other than us.  Well, rumor has it.  Rumor has it's controversy with Journey doing that. 
[02:07:30]  Is that true?  Well, we've only just done two gigs with them so far.  So we'll look into that.  It doesn't sound like it does.  No, they're pretty, they're actually amazing.  Dean, their drummer sings and plays as well.  So I think what you get is the singer goes off stage, and people that aren't particularly  familiar with who does what, here's these high vocals coming out, and the singer's not  there.  Right.  And they're thinking it's tape, but it's actually, a pair of binoculars that's sorted  out, you know, the drummer's singing.  Yeah.  And playing.  It's actually pretty amazing.  Eric Smith's got a great keyboard player that does a lot of the harmonies on top of Steven. 
[02:08:00]  Yeah.  And, you know, he's sitting on the side of the stage getting, like, zero credit, and  he's throwing these harmonies way up on top of Steven Tyler.  But again, you know, Steven's a great singer.  Oh, yeah.  Absolutely.  But a lot of these guys are out there, and it's all like...  Well, the thing is, they want it to sound like a record, and Steven sings both parts  on all the records.  I know, yeah.  So they need somebody else to do the other part.  Now, if he could do that, though.  What do you think of bands...  At the same time.  What do you think of bands that go on without the lead singer?  It's something we talk about from time to time on this show. 
[02:08:30]  Like Journey.  Instrumental band.  Well, hang on.  ACDC did that, don't forget.  ACDC did it, and it worked great for them.  Van Halen, you know, got some mileage out of it, too.  I think, well, actually, technically, Van Halen were bigger with Sammy than they were with ...  Yeah, right.  Commercially more successful, yeah.  Commercially, maybe not in everybody's...  We have this theory that these bands will go on forever without the original members,  you know?  It's been happening for years.  You can go and see the Drifters or the Four Topps in any casino all over the country,  and there's one guy who once emptied the trash for Leo. 
[02:09:00]  Yeah, exactly.  And they get the...  They become a tribute band.  This is the discussion we have all the time, the who's down to two guys at this point.  So I'm not sure about that.  See, it depends if the reasons for doing it.  If they're really into it still, like when Sammy joined Van Halen, they still wrote songs,  they were still into their thing, so it's still a real band.  If someone's going, well, we need someone to fill in because we want to do some shows  and make some cash, then you can see that.  It's pretty obvious, you know?  But when someone's real about it, Journey sound exactly like they did before, so it's 
[02:09:30]  pretty amazing.  I also think it depends if you're a fan or not.  I mean, I love the who, and the fact that there's only 50% of them, it's not Townsend  or Daltrey's fault.  And if they want to still go out and play Won't Get Fooled Again, and enough people can  film Madison Square Gardeners that want to hear it, I don't really see a problem in that.  But like you say, if they're rubbish when you go, and they're rubbish constantly for  the tour, and it's obvious that it's just a paycheck, then it's wrong.  If Townsend seriously believes that it's his destiny to play these songs till he drops 
[02:10:00]  dead, then God bless him.  It's more Roger Daltrey wants to continue.  How hard is it to replace a lost band member?  I mean, it's got to be hard, because especially you guys so young when you started, and the  camaraderie's there, and you know each other.  Well, we left it alone for a year.  We didn't even go there, you know, because the grieving mourning period, or whatever you  want to call it, and just letting it kind of settle in your mind what's actually happened 
[02:10:30]  and what you're going to have to do to carry on.  You're not going to really make a great decision in a month or two.  So we finished the Adrenalise album as a four-piece, because we didn't feel comfortable getting  somebody else in.  It was a year afterwards when we'd all kind of collectively had a time to get over it  all, that we thought, okay, it's time to move on.  And then you go through the kind of audition period or whatever.  But we didn't do that. 
[02:11:00]  You see, we definitely come from a different headspace.  It's not all about getting the best guy.  If we did get the best guy, which we probably did, that wasn't the main focus.  Our main focus was taking it into consideration, which a lot of bands don't.  The 22 hours you're not on stage are way more important, as much as it's important to be  on stage.  Oh, that's really interesting.  I never thought of it that way.  Sometimes you don't interact at all on stage.  It's not because you're not liking each other, it's because you're just too busy doing your  own thing.  Doing your respective jobs, yeah.  But for 22 hours a day, when you're not on stage, apart from when you're asleep, you're 
[02:11:30]  in each other's pockets.  You're going to be in each other's pockets for another decade.  You've got things that you have to have in common.  So the only ground rules we had were, I said, we'd really prefer somebody British, somebody  that knows what soccer is, and somebody that understands Monty Python.  And you've got that.  And if you can play.  You're about 90% of the way to being the right guy.  And if you can sing, dance, play as well, then it works out fine.  And Vivian's talent wasn't in question.  Right on. 
[02:12:00]  The only thing that we weren't sure about is, like, could we live with him for 22 hours  a day?  Right.  14 years later, I think proof of the pudding is, yeah.  That's our music.  We've got to stop this part of the Opie and Anthony show.  You're going to do the walkover to XM with us?  Hey, we'll do it.  We'll give out some new CDs.  I'm not throwing darts at your stomach.  No, no problem.  The new CD's called Yad, and Def Leppard's playing the PNC tonight, right?  Yeah, absolutely.  Can I have my thumb back now?  It's Def Leppard, Joe Elliott, and Phil Collin.  And we'll continue with the Opie and Anthony show in moments exclusively on XM Satellite 
[02:12:30]  Radio.  The Opie and Anthony XM walkover begins now.  How cool is this?  We've got Def Leppard for the walk today.  Whoa.  My mic's crapping out.  Okay. 
[02:13:00]  So this is a little weird.  We just kind of walked to the other studio.  That's fine by me.  Yeah, the weather is shitty.  And now, don't worry about fucking cursing, my friend.  Anything goes.  Let the fucks fly now.  All right, let's get out of here.  Stop it raining, though.  We can get an umbrella for you if you need.  No, no, no.  I just thought you might have the power to stop the rain.  Is it raining now?  No, it's all right right now.  I don't know why I asked that as I walked out.  This is just New York for you. 
[02:13:30]  Wet pavements, huh?  I heard you guys, well, we should have jumped in your limo, I'm thinking.  We jumped in a limo to come here.  We were in it for like a minute.  It's like, what's the point?  I just found out that there, well, let's just put it this way.  They could have walked here, but they decided to take their limo.  I bet it's close.  That is a rock star, my friend.  I can't believe we're walking now.  Jesus, what's going on?  Yeah, we're normally carried around.  Get the litter.  The box is like, what, the Pope's in and stuff? 
[02:14:00]  We could give, Kenny could give you like a piggyback ride or something.  I want a ride from the Dorksons.  The Dudesons.  The Dorksons.  I think you had it right the first time.  Fucking Dorksons.  We can throw darts at them while they're carrying us.  We should have done something.  We should have had strippers carry these guys or do something.  Yeah, I see strippers carrying us.  That would have been perfect.  I'm hoping one of our buses drives by so we can show these guys that we're famous or something.  And male strippers? 
[02:14:30]  Yeah.  Yeah, male strippers?  I don't be anywhere near someone who's going to drive by.  You mean a drive-by shooting?  Well, we're hoping one of our buses go by so we can feel real important in front of you.  Oh, yeah.  Because we're on.  Oh, there's our name right there in the back of that bus.  See?  Yeah, great.  See, we're almost somebody.  They're famous.  That's just as good as like 50 hit songs.  Can I come onto your stage?  That's just like selling 10 million CDs, right?  25 years of hit records.  And we're like, look, we're on the local. 
[02:15:00]  We want to come onto your stage now.  Yeah.  Well, we just did.  They were throwing darts at that guy's ass.  We suck.  Don't forget the new Def Leppard CD's called Yeah, all brand new material.  That is very cool.  And they're playing the PNC Arts Center tonight in Jersey.  Let's cross.  Yeah.  Yeah, cross this road.  You notice how people just don't even notice anything in New York?  Nobody.  They're on their way somewhere and fuck everybody else.  So did anybody get like, you know, live on the radio doing this?  It is strange.  Oh, we've had some problems here and there, but we've taken care of that so it won't happen again. 
[02:15:30]  Like what?  Let's just say we had a little confrontation with another radio show once.  There was a choking.  Kind of a standoff against somebody else in the middle of the street.  That sounds cool.  It was kind of like if Winger was trying to, you know, mess with you.  Yeah, yeah.  No, I see where you're going, yeah.  And you would, you know, slap him around a little bit and laugh at him and then move on with your gig.  We don't need to laugh at Winger.  It was done for us by Beavis.  Wow. 
[02:16:00]  That guy was a little creepy.  She's the guy in the hat over there.  You look like keep your children away from him.  Yeah.  All right.  All right.  Hold on a minute.  Jimmy's just getting a picture.  Jimmy's getting a snapshot with a nice, uh, with a very lovely young lady.  Lovely lady.  Okay.  Look.  There it is.  It's funny.  Two fucking rock legends walks by and she asked me for a picture.  She has no idea.  I know.  She hears the replay and realizes she'll feel like the dumb whore that she is. 
[02:16:30]  Good guy with Jimmy.  All right.  We're almost at XM here.  That's something you don't see every day.  A priest with an iPod.  See that?  Fantastic.  Yeah, what's on a priest's iPod?  He's probably listening to the sound.  No, he's probably listening to the sound of kids talking.  He's listening to the running with the devil.  All right.  We're going to go in here.  All right.  We're going to continue with, uh, Def Leppard in a few minutes.  Guys, thanks for doing the walk with us today. 
[02:17:00]  Let's hear it for Def Leppard.  Thanks, man.  All right.  We'll continue with Phil Collin and, of course, Joe Elliott.  Def Leppard in just a few minutes.  Opie and Anthony, XM 202.  Radio bad boys, Opie and Anthony are about to make their return to the airwaves.  Opie and Anthony were pulled from the airwaves two years ago after a sex stunt at St. Patrick's Cathedral.  Opie and Anthony are back, so why won't the FCC be able to touch them this time?  The duo has signed with XM Satellite Radio.  Their contract with Infinity expired back in May, but the no-compete portion is up until October. 
[02:17:30]  No arrests have been made.  Police are still investigating.  Let's do it!  The blonde one, uh, two so-called radio shots.  Our society needs borders.  It needs parameters.  You dick!  They get their jollies by saying, let's keep pushing the envelope.  They were doing what they were paid to do.  Even when they're about to be made, there's a price to be paid in terms of the cultural degradations that we do not want to be associated with anymore. 
[02:18:00]  Are you adequately prepared to rock, rock, rock?  The Opie and Anthony show.  But enough of this palaver.  Let's get the show on the road.  We'll see you next time. 
[02:18:30]  We'll see you next time.  We'll see you next time.  and look there we are and now we continue to continue the show we lost joe elliott though  he's stuck in an elevator that's okay wow the mics work here yeah yeah wow  isn't this a stupid job we have where we have to like leave and we have change the vernacular it's 
[02:19:00]  like two jobs i thought by this point in my life i wouldn't need to hold down two jobs  that's cool that's cool yeah this is the uh uncensored version of the opium anthony show  anything goes so don't worry about you know dropping f-bombs or uh there you go talking  about any kind of uh blow jobs or anything else that might have happened under a stage or not 
[02:19:30]  yeah we would have had a lot of fun with that pickle story over here today  all right the chick that was scared of pickles i heard that was in the bathroom yes it was pretty  funny yeah she definitely uh that had nothing nothing to do with pickles all right we found  joe elliott you should have taken that elevator with us why somebody farted in it didn't they  yes they did i was warned i tried disgusting jimmy i tried to but i i just i couldn't there's a bunch  of chicks on the elevator that would have been fucking perfect well you try to shit yourself  i really always do on the elevator just send them out thinking this was a great example of new yorkers

[02:26:00]  they actually shoot the referee oh yeah they'll kill people for making a bad colombia too they killed  on because the guy scored on his own kids so the guy yelled on goal you know because of a rational  culture and he shot his uh they shot the goal well escobar his name was he got shot outside a restaurant  when he got back to the right right back to his company yeah because there was so much money that  the colombian mafia had so much money bet on it on the on the team wow they were going to like triple  their income for the year if they won one more game and the guy scored on goal so they uh they 
[02:26:30]  took him out everyone's name escobar anyone who's gotten shot over there it's called escobar  drugs over there i think it means is that smith down there yeah jones pablo smith  all right let's uh let's go to the phones i'm trying to find this ah whatever what do you need  sweetie they're getting it for me uh basically def leppard is one of five bands to sell 10 million  cds twice yeah wow yeah uh pyromania and hysteria and i know what you're about to say we're in 
[02:27:00]  great company that's what i was gonna say zeppelin the beatles pink floyd van halen  and i know that's it i think uh-huh isn't that amazing no uh-huh i just missed a few months yet  before they get in there yeah you know what actually amazes me is that the rolling stones  haven't even done it once i can't believe that the stones have never had an album that did so that  that means we're better than them yes isn't that weird better than the stones  that's i don't know about that that's gonna be a part no no no these guys are legends i wonder 
[02:27:30]  why that is though like with the because we're taller than them all right they're all small the  stones are like five foot three five foot four no they're not i think they're pretty short charlie  watts looks like he might be tall but no jack is about five seven they're actually they're about  five seven five eight they're all pretty small they're about the size of phil which is pretty  small five five says no mick jagger's bigger than me he's he's like five ten no he's not he's not 
[02:28:00]  he's not nah plus they wear big shoes i think they are in his shoes you know before they go on tour  they all have to be 140 pounds really apparently apparently yeah which is like amazing when you think  you know yeah so they they're really doing it they're actually really doing it they don't know  they don't know how to climb coconut trees though no no they're not climbing they just don't know how to  get back down wow that was a stupid move the hell is he thinking and they also started pop metal 
[02:28:30]  he wanted to make his own pina colada yeah you know so he's gonna get it from scratch and climb up a  tree and build his own have you guys met anybody uh that really awed you i guess as musicians that  you're working with or they got to meet at an event that just blew you away well i suppose we'd  be in awe of people that we grew up listening to more than anything else but then you meet them and  then just become like normal like queen we met brian may and he ended up joining the band almost  it's like seven times you know after a while you're like jesus anyone get brian to leave i know he's got 
[02:29:00]  dressing room and everything they're trying to do a gig here i met keith and i was a little  awestruck yeah yeah how about that big one well we met mick in different circumstances he was in  a studio next door to us when we were doing hysteria and he was you know he'd we'd see him in the  canteen like every day and he'd be borrowing our newspaper and inviting what's he doing his solo album  back then he's doing she's the boss oh yeah you guys had the the better album there yeah not even 
[02:29:30]  close sold a few more not even how about mccartney have you met mccartney no no met his band we know  his band pretty well um and i went to see them at the uh in anaheim and uh staples center is it yeah  in l.a um last year and it was incredible absolutely incredible saw the stones at the  bollywood bowl as well right and they were again this you know they still got it i mean jag is 62  and he's like he moves around more than that we saw him last year and it was unbelievable he's 
[02:30:00]  absolutely still doing it yeah he's an amazing guy right you know the stone we love the stones they're  just you know what was your first uh what was your first concert you went to sesame street deep purple  when i was 14. no i just made that up to me i was kind of picturing that whole thing like wow  that's got a really good history didn't exist we had the muppets yeah yeah now deep purple deep  purple is a great first concert you kidding me t-rex t-rex t-rex in 71 i was 11. wow that's a good 
[02:30:30]  one my mom let me go out but i had to be back by 10. so i stayed till half past and got grounded  for a week i think mine was the village people my father took me all right here's a fucking awful  moment my father this is what you admit in front of the rock stars my father took me to see the  village people and sister sledge oh wow i enjoyed the we are family i tapped my faggoty foot to it  back in like the mid-70s at one point yeah but the funny thing is now you listen to those songs  on one of these cd collections like you know the pure funk or pure disco yeah when you're on an 
[02:31:00]  overnight bus ride to wherever and that cd goes on everybody gets up and dancing in the corridor and  stuff you know called the guilty pleasure yeah absolutely yeah everybody's got one it's like  nostalgia too you kind of like yeah age just brings your back takes the corners off everything  they're like records though they really are they were really good records that's the thing  a little they were well made some of them yeah some of them like this bottle is well made 
[02:31:30]  heavily produced they were functional records you were great by the way and uh don't blame me  there's an aussie documentary which is amazing and joe was interviewed really great stories was  i really yeah what did i say he's told a story about how uh you you were on tour with aussie and  you looked out and he was pissing out the window onto the people who were online without even  knowing he was doing it that was that was at the uh stanley theater in pittsburgh yeah we were  opening for aussie 1981 and he came into our dressing room completely out of his tree and it 
[02:32:00]  was about 7 15 and he was like all right boys uh do you want anything you need anything you're  all enjoying the tour and all this is he's stumbling on it he just zipped the trousers down  got his old man out opened the window just pissed off with a fire escape and there's all the  kids do it together funny stuff all right let's go to the phones people want to talk to you guys  from all over the country george in colorado what's up hey guys hey uh when you guys played 
[02:32:30]  here in colorado uh and the video for pour some sugar on me is evident for that uh from that i was  the security guard down below the stage during that and i can definitely say that a lot of the  rumors of the debauchery are true um i'm curious does it still go on did you get a blowjob is that  what you're trying to tell us that was you i am sworn to secrecy for what all i thought down below  see these rumors are all great and well and good and everything and we'd love to kind of confirm 
[02:33:00]  every one of them but how would we perform the songs if we weren't up there on the stage right this  is the thing you know you don't want to be known as logic there was there was a a moment in the set  where me and rick used to do an audience participation bit where the other three guys  would go underneath the towel off and have a beer that's the only possibility of anything like that  happening and it used to last maybe seven minutes so it would have to be a real quickie you don't  want to be known as the quickie these guys have got stamina you know they're hips it could have been 
[02:33:30]  the road crew yeah see that's it if they had beards it would have been the crew the crew always looking  to grab the crew let's go to john in virginia john what's up john yes that's always hey joe i gotta  ask you man i saw the film okay now back in the day when you guys first got got signed and you were  working with that producer and he encouraged you to go higher with your voice and you did it and it  was so like enthralling and it almost changed the entire sound of the band overnight you guys were 
[02:34:00]  probably before that but but when you were able to do that and go there with your voice what was  that like for you as a singer when you realized hey man this is it it was only a tv show it wasn't  real they're not real well it was you know i it was trying to get a point across that the guy was  pushing me harder than i would have pushed myself um but you know that was what mutt did mutt taught us  that there was more to it than what you think you've got you know he pushed us harder and harder  which basically also made that made us go higher and higher he did the same thing with brian johnson 
[02:34:30]  we were just talking about this yesterday somebody asked johnner you know how do you hit those high  notes he says i don't know he says but once i hit them once i have to hit them for the rest of my  life yeah it's because he wanted to you know shove mutt shove johnner up into the higher keys which  he never would have done with bond scott but with me he just wanted to make it more it's an easier  register to mix lower in you know so you can have the guitars up higher is basically what it is 
[02:35:00]  but i'm the one that has to put the rubber bands around the old wedding tackler  he's got a pink big rubber band  i was gonna ask the guy if i couldn't have it because i saw a good use for that  let's go to tom in sacramento tom what's up  hey man what's going on up joe i'm gonna ask you man and you've probably have been asked this before  but what the fuck does um talk leave and globin globin mean and it's to start one of your songs  wow oh yeah shit it doesn't mean anything it was again it was more we we were when we pieced that 
[02:35:30]  song together it was so random and because we hadn't written the vocals we didn't know where the  guitars were going to come in because there was no clues but mott had this structure in his mind so he  would do counts into each section and after a while he got fed up with just going one two three four and  started making up all these stupid phrases and when we put the song together we lifted that one  out the middle of the song and just that's pretty cool but funny story um some guy in germany uh  interviewed us once and he said he translated it and it meant in german running through the forest 
[02:36:00]  silently which it doesn't but it's great to think that somebody actually thinks somewhere in the  world that it actually does you know right on that just meaningless dribble let's go to max and  dials max what's up hey what's going on guys hey i had a funny situation happened to me the other day  i had uh i got one of their t-shirts i still have it from the castle donnington monsters of rock back  and i think it was like 86 86 yeah 86 that's right and my son was wanting to cut the grass and he said 
[02:36:30]  can i borrow a t-shirt i said yeah go ahead he goes in and puts the goddamn t-shirt on and i come out i  said what the hell are you doing i made him take it off and he goes who the hell are these guys  anyhow you like all that old man shit so i put on a high and dry album now we can't get enough of  you guys well thank you for bringing in the new generation you gave him a good hiding though for  taking your shirt yeah you guys i'm a manchester united fan too by the way oh well that's enough 
[02:37:00]  of that then you guys got a lot of you got a lot of uh young people coming to see you still  yeah actually more so you know it's kind of that it's really cool it is really we saw kiss recently  and you're not seeing the old not a lot of young people not a lot of young people man the girl's  still trying to squeeze into that spandex that uh they should have thrown away 10 years ago i saw  that as well yeah i mean you know you get them all let's say you hang around long enough you get  more of everything but i first started noticing uh i saw the stones in 89 on the steel wheels tour 
[02:37:30]  and i was stood next to a seven year old kid who sang every word and i was like wow that's pretty  cool oh this is cool if this can happen to them it can happen to us later on you know and i think  that back to that now jagger was younger then than i am now oh that scares me to death yeah  he was like 44 and i'm 46 you know wow there are some bands that just have that longevity you know  you're able to to keep going and others like um there's more to it than music that's why  yeah it's the least thing that we do in this band is perform there was one i sing now and again 
[02:38:00]  horrible moment at i believe it was uh warrant was that the uh the concert with the drummer  i know it was a warner winger i think it was warrant yeah and and they're playing a show and it's a  very small venue and not many people are there and they're you know going through the motions and  the drummer at one point gets up and throws his sticks out and you actually heard  as they as they hit the open floor he overthrew the crowd and it's like wow you know that's that's 
[02:38:30]  just gotta hurt man that is gotta hurt we've all done it luckily we did it at the start of our career  yeah at the end of the beginning any band we did a gig once in a place called new brighton which is near  liverpool in england and there was 11 people in and one of them was a kid doing his homework  he never looked up once from his book oh it's like that's gonna drive you nuts hey you know  when you're 16 17 you know you just think that they're just being rude so you just pick on them 
[02:39:00]  and you guys have any spinal tap moments every day yeah actually at least give us give us a real good  one oh right a good one the other night i walked into a wall as i was walking on stage actually i've got  to get the doctors after i've got to get mri after this we we were just going on stage at jones beach  and the lights go out and i go so i limp up these steps because i have to look cool at the beginning  of the show and everything because i started the guitar riff off and um this this knee i got off  stage and i couldn't walk so yeah so every night something like that happens i mean yeah god damn 
[02:39:30]  every day there's always something goes wrong and mike breaks down or we don't have the pods to to get  trapped in yeah the pie we did once we had similar we've had all we had them triangles come out and  we were like on stage and we'd we'd heard about this thing and we're like this triangle come out  the ceiling and it's it was the stonehenge thing and then we had to jump off them and they were all 
[02:40:00]  wobbly and it's like oh man and so we we kind of we stopped using it after but always there's always  something i mean everybody has even the coolest bands in the world i saw you two get stuck in their  lemon once that's that's a true story yeah the lemon wouldn't open up what about the the pyro when  he used to pyro pete who used to do our pyrotechnics you know you'd you'd lose eyebrows and also oh yeah  you know it just obviously can't do that stuff anymore not like that but this was there was so  much of it well especially all over the stage you had to know where to be and the last night of the 
[02:40:30]  tour he'd have like oh i've got like a gallon and half of stuff left over let's put it all in yeah  yeah i've really packed them up tonight guys so stay clear when you know marshal flying over the  back you know the back row of the audience it's very odd steve clark fell down um a trap door that  had late we had lasers this is in 87 and he went oh and over he went and uh his guitar his les pole  just landed and stopped him falling on all this glass laser stuff so yeah i love the spinal tap 
[02:41:00]  it's brilliant i love him great uh let's go to george in chicago george what's up hey guys i got  a question for duff leopard uh yeah i saw this documentary that came out last year made in  sheffield and it sort of talks about the sheffield england music scene in the late 70s early 80s  and they mentioned that you guys sort of you know came up around the same times like human league and  abc and a lot of those kind of bands i was just wondering if you'd talk a little bit about your days  in sheffield and if you kind of associated with those people or you kind of made your own path 
[02:41:30]  well musically obviously we were the odd ones out because sheffield in the late 70s early 80s was  kind of a little bit like the beatles were sorry merseyside in liverpool the mersey sound or whatever  in 62 63 there was a lot of bands coming out um they didn't all sound like the beatles but for a  little while liverpool was a hub of the british music industry and then it moved back to london as normal  and then it it just kind of it happens that seattle became the big thing in the late 80s 
[02:42:00]  but sheffield had this this little period of about a year where there was us the human league heaven 17  abc uh thompson twins they all came from within about 12 miles uh of each other and we were the  odd ones out musically but i used to see these guys all the time and i used to be stood next to  hang on one second hello yeah yeah and when the saints are marching in yeah yeah yeah no i said 
[02:42:30]  i'd yeah i'll leave it in a brown envelope behind the toilet leave the merchandise yeah yeah right  okay thanks bye sorry about that um very important call yeah um the um the there was a record shop just  down the road from where i used to live and phil okey from the human league used to be in there and  many times i'd be stood next to him we'd be going through the racks and like hey how are you doing  and he had his hair short to one side and really long yeah the new wave style yeah and we'd just be 
[02:43:00]  buying the same records though he was looking for some old bowie and i was looking for some old bowie  it's like it's weird we both grew up on the same thing but we fought such different directions man  really yeah thank god for you guys you know because you probably could have you know easily went with  the new wave uh no we couldn't i'm talking when you first first started before you really found your  voice and found what the band we were always going to be a rock band see that's cool because  because you guys survived the new wave thing and then obviously you survived the grunge thing a lot  of bands from your ear as soon as grunge hit they were gone kurt cobain wiped everybody out but you 
[02:43:30]  guys continued after that even though you see that's the whole thing that i mean like you said about the  warrant winger thing all of those bands stopped because of right of grunge and uh that's why they're  throwing their sticks out and no one's catching them you know literally and it was also like they  were the tail end of that whole genre of music you guys were like we started a lot of a and r  men all over the country said sign me a band that sounds like def leppard which is what happened 
[02:44:00]  which is why cook you started the pot metal thing you know i i seriously have said it many times  i think kurt cobain tried to kill everybody that sounded like def leppard because there were too many of  us if there had only been us he would have been fine with it but there were so many other bands  trying to sound like us that it just got it flooded the market yeah right but going back to your earlier  point you know it doesn't matter the kind of music that the thompson twins made or abc or the human  league these guys are actually okay people and that's why we that you'll never see those guys trashing 
[02:44:30]  us in the press and vice versa because we actually used to have a drink with them and and and talk to  them and just say isaac oh yeah we've got a gig over here oh yeah we're playing there next week and  that are they still doing it are they just that short air we had long air yeah are they still doing it  yeah i think so some of them are yeah yeah whose idea was the big like big sounding chant vocal that  just everyone started doing well mutt langer produced that really to do that but you know we were always 
[02:45:00]  big fans of queen and they done that and what mutt did when he when he got older def leppard was like  let's do that but make it more yeah and and that was his whole thing because that's such a signature  sound it really is it is but there's little hints i mean the music that we on the new album the songs  that we've covered on the new album a lot of those songs influenced the way that we ended up writing  songs and you listen to bands like slade who never really took off in the states but slade with songs  like the only you'll be feeling familiar with slade through quiet riot with come on feel the noise 
[02:45:30]  and mama we're all crazy now with slade songs they had these big like what we used to call  soccer terrace chant chorus right okay and as much as they didn't do them in comparison they don't  sound as good but back then they were anthemic and they were large and they made a lot of sense in  1973 to a 12 year old kid you know it's like they were just big you know yeah and a lot of bands that  did choruses like that influence the way that we did things he made them more musical you know they the 
[02:46:00]  slade guys would just stick loads of reverb on them and what made us do was like just multi-track  and multi-track so the chorus of rock of ages is like maybe 400 voices yeah which is the four of us  multi-tracked 100 times but the big difference with us and and like bands that done big vocals like you  say sticks and reo speedwagon and stuff like that where they were it that wasn't rock and roll as was  coming from a different place right and we were screaming it and like losing it we was like hurting our 
[02:46:30]  throat's doing it yeah so it had a different totally different vibe we shout we don't sing  pour some sugar on me yeah it's pour some sugar on me and that's how you pronounce that's how you do  it in another way but you're doing it hacking wrong it's jagger it's take jagger and make jagger into a  backing vocal they only have a couple minutes because phil's got a doctor's appointment i have my  name that moment for your let's say hi to doug in jersey doug wall hello hey doug hey man i i just 
[02:47:00]  wanted to uh to call up and thank you guys because uh back in 96 when i got married um we were lucky  enough to uh be able to get an invitation to you through a uh soccer game that you played with some  radio guys from philly and uh you guys were nice enough to write a little paragraph and tell us you  were going to be on tour in england and uh all find it and i always thought that that was really 
[02:47:30]  cool that is cool you know we do what we can occasionally you get into a situation where somebody  gives you just enough file where you can actually respond to it you know you get to your dressing  room and there'll be three envelopes on the coffee table and you open them up some kids i i'm eight  and my mom turned me on to your music can you sign my cd sleeve and there's a stamped address  envelope inside it yeah you can't help but just how are you not going to do that you sign it and  you suppose that's easy you know you uh read the emails i i mean uh met like message board no 
[02:48:00]  things like that no no you don't want to say it's torture it's terrible and i am an idiot i i get on  i read i read about how bad we are and this sucks and what you did suck to and i respond like an idiot  i'm i'm one of these now you know that you can't do that your space will just destroy your life it  does it does you know what it's what he always say opinions are like assholes everybody's got one  and they're not all pretty here's the difference while we're responding to email they're

[03:02:30]  in her bathroom so i just threw up under her bed and then and then so she came back you know she came  back out we started hooking up again and then next thing i know i'm hearing this jingling noise and i'm  like what the fuck is that and so i stop i think it's you know like the bed moving or you know from  sex and then i stop and she's like the noise is still going and she's like oh that's just my dog  he always licks himself when uh you know when i'm having sex and then all of a sudden i'm like oh my  god he's not licking himself he's eating the vomit so then i'm like you know having sex or 
[03:03:00]  fucking i guess my next time i'm fucking this girl and the dog is like i i almost couldn't stay hard i had  i had to focus normally you gotta you know focus to like to to hold it in i had to focus just to  stay hard i had i had a chick this is true too uh not long ago she was blowing me and uh i  fucking like when i when i come you know how it is when you like if you grab the ball you  fucking push your hips and i i'm a shooter i'm like i like a i fucking blast and uh i  fucking crammed it and i hear and i've never actually had it happen all over my 
[03:03:30]  fucking balls and on my bed dude did she it's in the book dude and she's like i'm sorry he's  like yeah it's in the book dude she's like i'm sorry i ate a muffin before i came i had muffin all  over me no the best the best my favorite blowjob story i got two favorites one is uh this girl took  me you know like back to her place she was like kind of chunky but she kind of had that look like  you know she could suck the fuck out of you you know yeah yeah so uh so we go back to her place and 
[03:04:00]  um you know i take off you know pants were sitting on her sofa and she's blowing me she  it was like unbelievable like the type of blowjob makes your ankle sweat you know and so she gets  up like afterwards i guess to go wash out her mouth or whatever and i stand up and you know put my  pants on and there's a huge skid mark on her white sofa from me i didn't know what to do you know because  like it was the worst part was like you know like this she comes out of the bathroom and i'm like oh my  god and so i couldn't flip the sofa like the cushion in front of her so you know so i sweep her 
[03:04:30]  up all romantically and carry her in the bedroom i kind of had to lug her in the bedroom and then  you know after i hooked up with her four or five times or whatever until one of us passed or she  passed out and then i went and flipped the the cushion after she was asleep a big brown skid mark  that or the time that this one time this girl uh burped like you know she swallowed and  then it would have been funny if if when you turn the skid mark cushion over there was another 
[03:05:00]  one on the other side from the other guy facing the other way  that'd be great all right let's uh go to brett in boston brett what's up hey opi how's it going bud  hey hey so this guy tucker maxx i guess he's got a website right i've read a bunch of his stories but  they're the ones that are just on the edge of believable but if they're true he's a stud so  i said tucker can you tell the story about uh your um tucker tries butt sex story yeah all right  that's that's the one everyone asks for all right this story uh this is a true story um i you know 
[03:05:30]  like i was maybe 20 21 was spending a summer in florida uh when i was in college and uh i met this  one girl she's really hot and and uh i never tried butt sex before and i really wanted to so i kept  trying to convince this girl and she wouldn't she's like no i don't know and so i finally convinced her  i'm like look you know it's like she wanted to be a runway model that's why she was living in south  beach i was in florida at the time and i'm like you know it's what all the models do blah blah blah  i finally convinced her by convincing her that like it was what it was like the european way to  have sex this is like the level of intelligence of this girl and so anyway so but she's like you 
[03:06:00]  know you have to take me to a nice dinner and it's got to be like a production so i take her out and uh  and we go to some restaurant tantra actually and i spent like 400 bucks on this girl on dinner and you  know two like good bottles of wine and whatever so we she's totally ready and we go back to my  place and what i hadn't told her you gotta remember i was like 20 i think 20 or 21 at the time and like  i'm kind of an asshole now but i was possibly the worst person on earth at this point in my life  so what i hadn't told her was that my buddy and i decided that since this is gonna be the first time 
[03:06:30]  i've had butt sex that uh i wanted to videotape it right and but instead of just like setting up like  a camera this is like nine years ago so it's before like you know like really cheap cameras we had  like one of the like this sort of shoulder ones right they had like the vhs sort of like that  except the crappy version right right and so my buddy hid in the closet with the camera and was  going to film us like so he's hanging out my place and then you know he saw us pull up and then he was  going to go run in the closet and hide and so i was so shit-faced by the time that i got back i at 
[03:07:00]  this point i had pretty much forgotten that he was in there so we go in we start kissing whatever  and then uh you know like uh she's like okay i'm ready and so i i bought like you know one of the big  industrial like this size of like astroglide like it's like huge because i didn't know what  the fuck do i know about ass sex you know and so i'm figuring well you know a little bit's good so  more is better so i'm basically just now here i am filming this girl but at the same time i'm thinking  okay you know i don't want to hurt her anus so i pretty much like uncap it and just stick in her 
[03:07:30]  ass and just squeeze and i emptied like half the bottle because i'm thinking you know you got to put  enough in to make sure because i don't know how much it takes what do i know right and so and so  this is like pretty pretty much pre-internet porn you know and like i thought you could just spit  on your dick and you know like no that's like that's only important movies right yeah that's  the prison way right so i i fill her up with this stuff and then of course i slide right in no problem  and uh everything's going great for a while and uh you know and we start going harder and harder and  she's more into it i'm more into it and uh like i'm right about to come and uh you know i'm 
[03:08:00]  some hard i'm slamming hard come way in and out and i come out too far and uh and i kind of like  you know i come out and i and i like you know hit her butt or something so i go down to put myself  back in and all of a sudden i feel this like warm splash on my hand and it's and i'm like what the  lights are kind of low so i look down and it's like kind of dark and i'm like wait a minute and  then the smell hits me shit all over my dick and it wasn't just like poop it was like dire like 
[03:08:30]  watery diarrhea fucking mix of like diarrhea and astroglide and and so like the smell hits me  and it was like oh my and then of course i realized she's shit on my dick and then combine  that with like the seafood and the two bottles of wine and i just i blew all over her ass like in  her asshole everywhere and so i'm throwing up and she's like kind of hammered so she like turns  what are you doing she sees me throwing up she's throwing up everywhere so i'm seeing her throwing 
[03:09:00]  up it's making me throw i'm throwing up more all of a sudden true fucking story my fucking buddy  falls out of the closet then he's like oh my god because he saw us and smell you know smelled it  ivy you can imagine the smell and you know it's like seafood and wine and astroglide and shit and  he fucking is throwing up everywhere so like there's like a a three second period where all three of us  are staring at each other vomiting everywhere that video would be like yeah i know yeah you have no  idea how much that i am i don't have that i know and so anyway so she like you know of course freaks 
[03:09:30]  oh i thought you loved me i can't believe you did this throws you know the sheet like puts it wraps  the shit and astroglide stain sheet around her runs out of my apartment like leaves her clothes  everything i still to this day don't know how she got home like i called her you know three or four  times are you okay whatever she ended up changing her phone number like uh the girl who introduced  us uh like you know she wouldn't return her calls i don't know how she got home um but yeah it was uh

[03:17:30]  gonna ever do any of this right you know if i had known i was gonna become a writer a  motherfucker i would have you know gone through hell and high water to say that  yeah you know how much money i've cost myself that i could have charged i could have charged  ten bucks a person and i was in i was in a frat me and the boys would have figured out how to save  that tape let's be honest we would have uh figured something out hell yeah man if somebody  fucked me in the ass and threw up on me i would want that tape saved i mean um  all right let's go to  all right let's go to angry little fella angry what's up talker what's up fellas 
[03:18:00]  hey hey what up hi um talker i came across your website um when i was like off the screen lol  no i yeah anyways i came across your website when i was looking for absinthe online did you tell them  about driving into the donut shop yet uh no it's it's i mean like i can't tell the whole thing i mean  it's it's like uh 18 pages in the book i basically i got shitfaced on absinthe and uh and this girl and  i was like really drunk and this girl was she's like oh i'm too drunk to drive home you got to drive 
[03:18:30]  and i was like all right so i ended up driving her home and then she like had me drop her off at her  like apartment building and she's like we'll go find parking place and when you find it then come up  and i couldn't find a parking spot and i was fucking pissed off at her so i ended up like parking you  know i i found a spot and it was like uh kind of too small but i was still trying to cram the car in  there and i ended up jumping the curb and like running the back of the car into a a donut shop and  like crashing the window down and shit and so then i just pulled i got all scared so i just pulled the car 
[03:19:00]  off and like parked it somewhere and threw the keys like in the bushes and then like went home  i didn't even go up to her spot yeah so um i mean like this you got to read the story  when you condense 18 pages right into like it's not you know a sentence was there ever a police report  um no dude i looked and looked and looked and uh i never found one i remember one time i was in  colorado back in like 96 and i was fucking horny and uh yeah boulder right and i just i'm like

[03:20:30]  that are just as funny or just as cool as mine they just don't write them down i mean like if you  think about it it was just a crashed out window yeah just a crash in a donut shop i don't think  anyone would call the cops on that all right let's uh let's go to uh kyle in michigan kyle  yeah hey the lucky louis star jim norton hi kyle thanks for calling the program get to the point
